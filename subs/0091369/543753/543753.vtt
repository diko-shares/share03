1
00:02:58.012 --> 00:02:59.929
Give me the child.

2
00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:06.436
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

3
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:10.190
...I have fought my way here to
the castle beyond the Goblin City...

4
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:14.277
...to take back the child
that you have stolen.

5
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.531
For my will
is as strong as yours...

6
00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:22.118
...and my kingdom is as great.

7
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.961
For my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great.

8
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.296
Damn.

9
00:03:33.464 --> 00:03:36.966
Oh, I can never
remember that line.

10
00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:41.179
"You have no power over me."

11
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.144
Oh, Merlin.

12
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.319
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

13
00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:58.738
Come on. Come on!

14
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.204
Oh, it's not fair!

15
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.582
Oh, really.

16
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.793
- I'm sorry.
- Well, don't stand there in the rain.

17
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.379
- Come on.
- All right. Come on, Merlin.

18
00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:58.381
- Come on.
- Not the dog.

19
00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.758
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.

20
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:05.888
Oh. Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.

21
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.432
Go.

22
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:13.271
Sarah, you're an hour late.
I said I'm sorry!

23
00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.315
Please let me finish.

24
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.401
- Your father and I go out very rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.

25
00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.447
I ask you to babysit only if it
won't interfere with your plans.

26
00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:26.242
Well, how do you know?
You don't know what my plans are.

27
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.579
I assume you'd tell me if you had a date.
I'd like it if you had a date.

28
00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:33.708
- You should have dates at your age.
- Ah, Sarah, you're home.

29
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:37.420
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?

30
00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:42.133
She treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a fairy story no matter what I say.

31
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:43.760
I'll talk to her.

32
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.197
Through dangers untold...

33
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.618
...and hardships unnumbered...

34
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.288
...I have fought my way here
to the castle...

35
00:06:12.456 --> 00:06:14.457
...beyond the Goblin City...

36
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.253
...to take back the child...

37
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.506
...that you have stolen.

38
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.638
- Sarah, can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!

39
00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:30.306
You better hurry.
You're gonna be late.

40
00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.809
Listen, we fed Toby
and put him to bed.

41
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:36.062
We do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.

42
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:40.441
You really wanted
to talk to me, didn't you?

43
00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:43.319
Practically broke down the door.

44
00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:50.493
Lancelot! Someone has
been in my room again.

45
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:53.579
I hate that. I hate it!

46
00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:58.584
I hate you. I hate you!

47
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:04.215
Someone save me, someone take
me away from this awful place!

48
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.390
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?

49
00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:13.975
Okay.

50
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.604
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful, young girl...

51
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:22.859
...whose stepmother always made
her stay home with the baby.

52
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:23.359
And the baby was a spoiled child
and he wanted everything for himself...

53
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.320
And the baby was a spoiled child
and he wanted everything for himself...

54
00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.365
...and the young girl
was practically a slave.

55
00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:32.410
But what no one knew...

56
00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.621
...was that the king of the goblins
had fallen in love with the girl...

57
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.207
...and he had given her
certain powers.

58
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.792
So one night...

59
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.337
...when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her...

60
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.090
...she called on
the goblins for help.

61
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:49.177
Listen.

62
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.557
"Say your right words,"
the goblins said.

63
00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:59.353
"And we'll take the baby
to the Goblin City...

64
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.190
...and you will be free."

65
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:03.691
Ah!

66
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.361
But the girl knew that
the king of the goblins...

67
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:11.032
...would keep the baby in his castle
forever and ever and ever...

68
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.618
...and turn it into a goblin.

69
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.661
And so the girl
suffered in silence...

70
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:19.749
...until one night, when she was tired
from a day of housework...

71
00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.586
...and she was hurt by the harsh
words of her stepmother...

72
00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:25.922
...and she could no longer stand it...

73
00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:30.593
Oh, all right, all right.

74
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.848
Knock it off. Come on.

75
00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:40.102
Stop it! Stop it!
I'll say the words.

76
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.439
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

77
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:47.860
I wish... I wish...

78
00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.196
- She's going to say it.
- Say what?

79
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:52.573
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

80
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.575
You shut up.

81
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.453
Listen. She's going
to say the words.

82
00:08:57.621 --> 00:08:59.997
I can bear it no longer!

83
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:03.960
Goblin King, Goblin King,
wherever you may be...

84
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.630
...take this child of mine
far away from me!

85
00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:11.092
Oh...

86
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.343
That's not it.

87
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:16.013
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with "I wish."

88
00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.850
Oh, Toby, stop it!

89
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.856
Oh, I wish I did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.

90
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.693
"I wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."

91
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.778
That's not hard, is it? Huh?

92
00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:33.990
I wish...

93
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.576
I wish...

94
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:39.620
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!

95
00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:00.558
I wish the goblins would come
and take you away.

96
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.103
Right now.

97
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.583
Toby?

98
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.129
Toby, are you all right?

99
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:40.014
Why aren't you crying?

100
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:10.688
You're him, aren't you?
You're the Goblin King.

101
00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:13.649
I want my brother back,
please, if it's all the same.

102
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:16.026
What's said is said.

103
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.112
But I didn't mean it.

104
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.699
- Oh, you didn't?
- Please. Where is he?

105
00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:24.368
You know very well where he is.

106
00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:27.455
Please bring him back. Please.

107
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.541
Sarah...

108
00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.752
...go back to your room...

109
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.422
...play with your toys
and your costumes.

110
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.507
Forget about the baby.

111
00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.051
I can't.

112
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.846
I've brought you a gift.

113
00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.892
- What is it?
- It's a crystal.

114
00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.143
Nothing more.

115
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:51.479
But if you turn it this way...

116
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.189
...look into it...

117
00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.608
...it'll show you your dreams.

118
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:58.778
But this is not a gift
for an ordinary girl...

119
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:01.864
...who takes care
of a screaming baby.

120
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.075
Do you want it?

121
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.247
Then forget the baby.

122
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.834
I can't.

123
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.170
It isn't that I don't appreciate
what you're trying to do for me...

124
00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.088
...but I want my brother back.

125
00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.132
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.

126
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.810
Don't defy me.

127
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.695
You're no match for me, Sarah.

128
00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.948
But I have to
have my brother back.

129
00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.118
He's there, in my castle.

130
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.794
Do you still
want to look for him?

131
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.757
Is that the castle
beyond the Goblin City?

132
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:05.970
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back before it's too late.

133
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.888
I can't.

134
00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.975
Don't you understand that I can't?

135
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.726
What a pity.

136
00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.938
It doesn't look that far.

137
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.316
It's further than you think.
Time is short.

138
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.200
You have 13 hours in which
to solve the labyrinth...

139
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.452
...before your baby brother...

140
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.580
...becomes one of us...

141
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.164
...forever.

142
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.167
Such a pity.

143
00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:41.755
The labyrinth.

144
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.134
It doesn't look that hard.

145
00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.095
Well, come on, feet.

146
00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.202
Excuse me?

147
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.413
Oh, uh, excuse me!

148
00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.874
Oh, it's you.

149
00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.127
Excuse me, but I have to get through
this labyrinth. Can you help me?

150
00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:21.337
Hm.

151
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.885
Oh, how sweet.

152
00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:30.888
Fifty-seven! Heh, heh.

153
00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.557
- How could you?
- Yeah.

154
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.809
Poor thing.

155
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.355
You monster. Ow!

156
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.523
- Uh?
- It bit me!

157
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.735
Ha, ha, ha! What did you expect
fairies to do?

158
00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:48.906
I thought they did nice things,
like granting wishes.

159
00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.533
Shows what you know, don't it?

160
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.620
- Fifty-eight. Blah.
- You're horrible.

161
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.538
Huh? No, I ain't.

162
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.832
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

163
00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:01.710
- Sarah.
- That's what I thought. Heh, heh.

164
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.214
Fifty-nine.

165
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.508
Do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?

166
00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.010
- Maybe.
- Well, where is it?

167
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.595
Oh, you little...

168
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.389
Sixty! Ooh-ha!

169
00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.766
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?

170
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.977
- The door.
- What door?

171
00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:23.357
- It's hopeless asking you anything.
- Not if you ask the right questions.

172
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.317
How do I get into the labyrinth?

173
00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.822
Ah!

174
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.491
Now, that's more like it.

175
00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.494
You gets in there.

176
00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.464
You, uh, really going in there, are you?

177
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.468
Yes.

178
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.138
I'm afraid I have to.

179
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.746
Cozy, isn't it?

180
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:28.422
Now, would you go left or right?

181
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:35.012
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very far.

182
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.973
- Which way would you go?
- Me?

183
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.516
I wouldn't go either way.

184
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.352
If that's all the help you're
gonna be, you can just leave.

185
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.690
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.

186
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.026
Take this labyrinth.

187
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:52.362
Even if you get to the center,
you'll never get out again.

188
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.533
- That's your opinion.
- Well, it's a lot better than yours.

189
00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.120
Thanks for nothing, Hogwart.

190
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:05.209
Oh, it's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.

191
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:26.980
Oh...

192
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.608
Who's she?

193
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.609
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't turns or corners or anything.

194
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.403
This just goes on and on.

195
00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.871
Maybe it doesn't.

196
00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:28.792
Maybe I'm just taking it
for granted that it does.

197
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:07.956
Oh!

198
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:15.923
Oh.

199
00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.343
'Allo.

200
00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:28.602
Did you say "hello"?

201
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.438
No, I said, "'Allo,"
but that's close enough.

202
00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:37.027
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.

203
00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:40.113
You don't by any chance know the way
through this labyrinth, do you?

204
00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:42.658
Who, me? No, I'm just a worm.

205
00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.284
Oh.

206
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.370
Come inside, meet the missus.

207
00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:50.624
No, thank you,
but I have to solve this labyrinth.

208
00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.335
But there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.

209
00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:55.504
It just goes on and on.

210
00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:56.922
Well, you ain't looking right.

211
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.466
It's full of openings,
it's just you ain't seeing them.

212
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.885
- Well, where are they?
- There's one just across there.

213
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:04.388
It's right in front of you.

214
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:06.556
No, there isn't.

215
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:09.393
Come inside
and have a nice cup of tea.

216
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.480
- But there isn't an opening.
- Ha, ha, of course there is.

217
00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:17.109
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.

218
00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.903
- What?
- Go on. Go on, then.

219
00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.950
That's just wall.
There's no way through.

220
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.327
Things are not always
what they seem in this place.

221
00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.914
So you can't take
anything for granted.

222
00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.464
Hey!

223
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:42.884
- Hey. Hang on.
- Thank you.

224
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:46.096
- That was incredibly helpful.
- But don't go that way.

225
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.932
- What was that?
- I said, don't go that way.

226
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.476
Never go that way.

227
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.604
Oh. Thanks.

228
00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:57.899
Cor! If she had kept on
going down that way...

229
00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.861
...she'd have gone straight
to that castle.

230
00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:12.622
Toby.

231
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:16.626
I'm coming, Toby.

232
00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:30.974
Give me back this!
Go on, get off me.

233
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:34.144
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?

234
00:22:34.312 --> 00:22:36.229
Walk, walk, walk.

235
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:49.993
What's the matter?

236
00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.963
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

237
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:03.590
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

238
00:23:03.758 --> 00:23:05.258
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?

239
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:06.468
- You do.
- Do what?

240
00:23:06.636 --> 00:23:09.221
Remind me of the babe.

241
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.015
Quiet! A goblin babe.

242
00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:17.270
Well?

243
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:30.469
Hey, what goes on?

244
00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:34.556
Is a-writing
on the fragging walk-walk!

245
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.852
Your mother is
a fragging aardvark!

246
00:24:56.913 --> 00:24:59.706
In nine hours and 23 minutes...

247
00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:01.791
...you'll be mine.

248
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.718
- You got it?
- I got it.

249
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:37.137
Good. Shh.

250
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:39.973
Oh, no.

251
00:26:48.858 --> 00:26:51.943
Someone has been
changing my marks.

252
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.238
What a horrible place this is.
It's not fair!

253
00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:57.907
That's right. It's not fair.

254
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.119
But that's only half of it.

255
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.039
This was a dead end a minute ago.

256
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:06.499
No, that's the dead end behind you.

257
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:14.466
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?

258
00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:17.552
Well, the only way out of here
is to try one of these doors.

259
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.513
One of them leads to the castle
at the center of the labyrinth.

260
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:22.223
And the other one leads to...

261
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:25.018
- Ba-ba-ba-bum.
- Certain death.

262
00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:27.937
Ooh.

263
00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:30.607
Which one is which?

264
00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:32.776
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?

265
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:34.653
- Um...
- I, uh...

266
00:27:35.196 --> 00:27:37.447
- We don't know.
- But they do.

267
00:27:37.657 --> 00:27:40.533
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

268
00:27:41.285 --> 00:27:44.579
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.

269
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:47.540
It's in the rules.
And I should warn you...

270
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:51.586
...that one of us always tells the truth,
and one of us always lies.

271
00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:54.130
That's a rule too. He always lies.

272
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:57.759
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- Oh, what a lie.

273
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.304
He's the liar.

274
00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:04.015
All right. Answer yes or no.

275
00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:09.062
Would he tell me
that this door leads to the castle?

276
00:28:09.397 --> 00:28:12.023
Uh...

277
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.984
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

278
00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:16.986
Yes.

279
00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:20.907
Then the other door
leads to the castle...

280
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:23.368
...and this door leads
to certain death.

281
00:28:23.536 --> 00:28:24.577
Ooh.

282
00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:27.038
How do you know?
He could be telling the truth.

283
00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:28.623
But then you wouldn't be.

284
00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:31.376
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.

285
00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:34.295
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.

286
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:37.841
So if you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.

287
00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:40.009
Wait a minute. Is that right?

288
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.721
I don't know.
I've never understood it.

289
00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:47.142
No, it's right. I've figured it out.

290
00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.269
I could never do it before.

291
00:28:49.437 --> 00:28:52.522
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.

292
00:28:56.694 --> 00:28:58.153
Help!

293
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:03.199
Stop it! Help!

294
00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:06.953
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.

295
00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:09.038
We're helping hands.

296
00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:10.707
You're hurting.

297
00:29:10.875 --> 00:29:13.084
Would you like us to let go?

298
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.129
No!

299
00:29:16.964 --> 00:29:19.215
Well then, come on, which way?

300
00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:20.717
Which way?

301
00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:23.553
Up or down?

302
00:29:24.472 --> 00:29:26.139
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

303
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:28.141
We haven't got all day.

304
00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:31.019
Well, it's a big decision for her.

305
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:35.023
Which way do you want to go? Hm?

306
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:36.524
Yes, which way?

307
00:29:38.068 --> 00:29:41.321
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.

308
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:44.449
She chose down.

309
00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:46.743
She chose down?

310
00:29:46.911 --> 00:29:50.747
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now. Ha, ha, ha!

311
00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:04.803
She's in the oubliette.

312
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.848
Shut up! She should not have
gotten as far as the oubliette.

313
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:12.310
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.

314
00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:15.605
Won't she? The dwarf's about
to lead her back to the beginning.

315
00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:20.276
She'll soon give up when she realizes
she has to start all over again.

316
00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:21.694
Ha, ha!

317
00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.279
Well, laugh.

318
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.415
Who's there?

319
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:35.959
Me.

320
00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:39.921
- Oh, it's you.
- Yes, well...

321
00:30:40.089 --> 00:30:43.049
I knew you were gonna get into trouble
as soon as I met you.

322
00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:45.635
So I've come to give you a hand.
Heh, heh.

323
00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:49.097
Oh, you're looking around
now, aren't you?

324
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:51.975
I suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.

325
00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:54.060
Only the hole.

326
00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:58.523
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full of them.

327
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:01.693
- Really? How do you know that?
- Oh, don't sound so smart.

328
00:31:01.861 --> 00:31:04.112
You don't even know
what an oubliette is.

329
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.530
Do you?

330
00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:10.326
Yes, it's a place you put people
to forget about them.

331
00:31:10.494 --> 00:31:14.038
Now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.

332
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:17.041
And it so happens
that I know a shortcut...

333
00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:19.210
...out of the whole labyrinth from here.

334
00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:21.504
No, I'm not giving up now.

335
00:31:21.672 --> 00:31:23.548
I've come too far.

336
00:31:27.428 --> 00:31:31.180
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Of course you are.

337
00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:34.517
But it gets a lot worse from here on in.

338
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.271
Why are you so
concerned about me?

339
00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:41.232
Well, I am, that's all.

340
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.820
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.

341
00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:49.198
You like jewelry, don't you?

342
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:50.867
Why?

343
00:31:51.035 --> 00:31:54.871
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.

344
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.626
- You like it, don't you?
- Uh...

345
00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:01.461
- So-so.
- Oh.

346
00:32:01.962 --> 00:32:03.880
Okay.

347
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:05.548
Tell you what.

348
00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:09.427
You give me the bracelet and
I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth.

349
00:32:09.595 --> 00:32:12.180
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes, well...

350
00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:15.683
...that's what would make it
a particularly nice gesture on your part.

351
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.436
No. I'll tell you what.

352
00:32:18.604 --> 00:32:21.314
If you won't take me to the center,
take me as far as you can...

353
00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:24.817
- ...and then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?

354
00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:27.111
Plastic.

355
00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.238
Ooh.

356
00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:32.408
I don't promise nothing, but...

357
00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:36.412
I'll take you as far as I can.
Then you're on your own, right?

358
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:38.748
- Right.
- Right.

359
00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:42.001
Ooh. Plastic!

360
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.424
Here we go.

361
00:32:54.014 --> 00:32:55.598
Damn.

362
00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:57.183
Broom closet.

363
00:32:59.436 --> 00:33:02.355
Well, can't be right all the time.

364
00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:08.444
This is it. Come on, then.

365
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.783
Ooh.

366
00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:18.997
- This way.
- Don't go on.

367
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:22.375
Go back while you still can.

368
00:33:22.543 --> 00:33:25.628
This is not the way.

369
00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:29.215
Take heed and go no further.

370
00:33:29.383 --> 00:33:33.594
Beware. Beware.

371
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:36.139
Soon it will be too late.

372
00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:38.474
Ah! Don't pay any attention to them.

373
00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:42.145
They're just false alarms.
You get a lot of them in the labyrinth.

374
00:33:42.312 --> 00:33:44.188
Especially when you're
on the right track.

375
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:47.191
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, shut up.

376
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.486
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.

377
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:53.573
- Beware, for...
- Just forget it.

378
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:57.326
Please, I haven't said it
for such a long time.

379
00:33:57.494 --> 00:34:00.872
Oh, all right, but don't
expect a big reaction.

380
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.666
No, no, no, of course not.

381
00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:07.962
For the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.

382
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:10.882
- Thank you very much.
- Uh-oh.

383
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.175
Oh, no.

384
00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:18.264
Ah.

385
00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:20.391
What have we here?

386
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:22.810
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

387
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:25.605
Nothing? Nothing?

388
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.607
Nothing, tra-la-la?

389
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:30.693
Your Majesty, what a nice surprise.

390
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:32.904
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.

391
00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:34.405
Hoggle!

392
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:37.366
Hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?

393
00:34:37.534 --> 00:34:40.286
Helping? In what sense?

394
00:34:40.454 --> 00:34:42.830
In the sense that you're
leading her towards the castle.

395
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:46.167
No, no, I was taking her back
to the beginning, Your Majesty.

396
00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:47.668
What?

397
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:51.214
I told her I was gonna help her
solve the labyrinth...

398
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.509
...a little trickery on my part,
but actually...

399
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:57.720
What is that plastic thing
round your wrist?

400
00:34:58.263 --> 00:34:59.931
Oh...

401
00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:01.557
Oh, this?

402
00:35:03.811 --> 00:35:06.312
Oh, my goodness,
where did this come from?

403
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.897
- Higgle...
- Hoggle.

404
00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:10.733
Yes. If I thought for one second
that you were betraying me...

405
00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:14.737
...I'd be forced to suspend you
headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench.

406
00:35:14.905 --> 00:35:18.908
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!

407
00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:20.910
Oh, yes, Hoggle!

408
00:35:21.078 --> 00:35:23.538
And you, Sarah.

409
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.665
How are you enjoying my labyrinth?

410
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:29.919
It's a piece of cake.

411
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:31.629
Oh...

412
00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:37.051
Really? Then how about
upping the stakes. Hm?

413
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:39.053
That's not fair!

414
00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:41.264
You say that so often.

415
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:45.184
I wonder what your basis
for comparison is.

416
00:35:45.352 --> 00:35:47.728
So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it?

417
00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:51.357
Well, let's see how you deal with
this little slice.

418
00:35:58.782 --> 00:36:01.075
No, no, the cleaners!

419
00:36:01.243 --> 00:36:03.119
- What?
- Run!

420
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:11.294
You okay?

421
00:36:13.881 --> 00:36:15.298
Come on!

422
00:36:16.717 --> 00:36:18.134
Faster!

423
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.765
- Hoggle!
- Oh, no!

424
00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:27.685
The cleaners! The Bog of Stench!

425
00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:30.479
You sure got his attention.

426
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:56.505
Ah, this is what we need.

427
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.841
A ladder. Follow me.

428
00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:02.595
How can I trust you when I know you
were taking me back to the beginning?

429
00:37:02.763 --> 00:37:04.222
I wasn't.

430
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:08.726
I told him I was taking you back to
the beginning to throw him off the scent.

431
00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:11.604
Hoggle, how can I believe
anything you say?

432
00:37:11.772 --> 00:37:14.482
Well, let me put it this way.

433
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.734
What choice have you got?

434
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:20.529
You're right.

435
00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:26.285
You see, you've gotta
understand my position.

436
00:37:26.453 --> 00:37:29.872
I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me.

437
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.043
- What kind of position is that?
- No position. That's my point.

438
00:37:34.211 --> 00:37:37.088
And you wouldn't be so brave
if you'd ever smelled...

439
00:37:37.256 --> 00:37:39.257
...the Bog of Eternal Stench.

440
00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.467
It's... It's...

441
00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:46.681
Is that all it does, is smell?

442
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:49.058
Oh, believe me, that's enough.

443
00:37:49.226 --> 00:37:51.894
But the worst thing is, if you so much...

444
00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:54.063
...as put a foot in the Bog of Stench...

445
00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:57.358
...you'll smell bad
for the rest of your life.

446
00:37:57.526 --> 00:38:00.111
It'll never wash off.

447
00:38:00.279 --> 00:38:02.363
Ah.

448
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:07.994
Here we are, then.
You're on your own from now on.

449
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:12.581
- What?
- That's it. I quit.

450
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.667
Wait a minute.

451
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.503
Hoggle.

452
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:21.590
I said I didn't promise nothing.
I said I'd take you as far as I could go.

453
00:38:21.758 --> 00:38:24.427
You little cheat.
You nasty, little cheat.

454
00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:27.430
Now, don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.

455
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:29.598
Oh, yeah?

456
00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.350
But them's my jewels!

457
00:38:31.518 --> 00:38:34.937
You give them back!
Give them back. Give those back.

458
00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:38.149
- Ah-ah!
- Give those back to me!

459
00:38:38.317 --> 00:38:42.737
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?

460
00:38:42.904 --> 00:38:46.866
Them's my rightful property.
It's not fair!

461
00:38:47.034 --> 00:38:48.701
No, it isn't.

462
00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:51.454
But that's the way it is.

463
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:57.501
Hm? Ooh.

464
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.966
Excuse me, please,
but can you help me?

465
00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:06.302
Oh! A young girl!

466
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.637
Woo, woo, woo.

467
00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:11.390
And who is this?

468
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:15.186
- My friend.
- Well, yes.

469
00:39:15.354 --> 00:39:17.772
And what can I do for you?

470
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.940
Please, can you tell...? That is...

471
00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:23.611
I have to get to the castle at the center
of the labyrinth. Do you know the way?

472
00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:28.824
Ah. Ah. Well, yes, now.

473
00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:31.577
You want to get to the castle.

474
00:39:31.745 --> 00:39:33.954
How's that for brainpower, huh?

475
00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.331
Be quiet!

476
00:39:35.499 --> 00:39:37.166
Ah, nuts.

477
00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:40.294
So, young woman...

478
00:39:40.462 --> 00:39:44.799
...the way forward
is sometimes the way back.

479
00:39:45.759 --> 00:39:48.928
Ay, will you listen to this crap?

480
00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:52.765
- Will you please be quiet!
- Sorry. All right.

481
00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:53.974
- Okay?
- Okay!

482
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:56.102
- All right.
- All right!

483
00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:58.187
- What?
- Sorry.

484
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.649
Finished?

485
00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:04.276
Yes.

486
00:40:05.404 --> 00:40:08.030
Quite often, young lady...

487
00:40:08.198 --> 00:40:12.535
...it seems like we're not getting
anywhere, when in fact...

488
00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:15.955
- We are.
- We are.

489
00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:18.416
I'm certainly not getting
anywhere at the moment.

490
00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.709
Ha! Join the club.

491
00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:27.591
I think that's your lot.

492
00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:30.970
Please leave a contribution
in the little box.

493
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:35.057
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

494
00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:42.648
Well, I guess I can spare this.

495
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:47.736
Gracias, senorita.

496
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:50.823
You didn't have to give him that.

497
00:40:50.991 --> 00:40:52.825
He didn't tell you nothing.

498
00:40:52.993 --> 00:40:56.162
Well, then, there go
a couple of suckers.

499
00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:01.584
It's so stimulating being your hat.

500
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.838
Why did you say that...

501
00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:08.048
...about my being your friend?

502
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:09.592
Because you are.

503
00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:14.180
You're not be much of a friend, but you're
the only friend I've got in this place.

504
00:41:14.389 --> 00:41:16.557
Do you hear something?

505
00:41:16.725 --> 00:41:19.143
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.

506
00:41:20.604 --> 00:41:21.854
I like that.

507
00:41:22.856 --> 00:41:25.733
I ain't never been
no one's friend before.

508
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:29.987
- Goodbye!
- Wait a minute.

509
00:41:30.155 --> 00:41:32.072
- Keep the stuff.
- Are you my friend or not?

510
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.533
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's friend.

511
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:37.578
He looks after himself, like everyone.

512
00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:40.414
Hoggle is Hoggle's friend.

513
00:41:40.582 --> 00:41:43.083
Hoggle, you coward!

514
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:47.796
Well, I'm not afraid.

515
00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:51.300
Things aren't always
what they seem in this place.

516
00:41:57.641 --> 00:42:00.726
Try on this
for size, you big yeti!

517
00:42:00.894 --> 00:42:03.479
We've got you now, fuzz ball!

518
00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:06.190
All together, now.

519
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:16.283
If only I had something to throw.

520
00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:26.502
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!

521
00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:34.927
What happened? Who turned
out the light? I can't see!

522
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.682
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?

523
00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:42.142
Who bite me? Who bite me?

524
00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:46.230
- I can't see!
- What is going on?

525
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:53.070
Retreat!

526
00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:56.115
Who bit me?

527
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.701
My aching sushi!

528
00:43:11.214 --> 00:43:13.173
Now, stop that.

529
00:43:15.468 --> 00:43:18.053
Is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?

530
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:22.057
Don't you want me to help you down?

531
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:27.896
Ludo down.

532
00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:29.440
Ludo?

533
00:43:30.609 --> 00:43:31.734
Is that your name?

534
00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.653
Ludo.

535
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:38.198
You seem like such a nice beast.

536
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:42.453
Well, I certainly hope
you are what you seem to be.

537
00:43:44.456 --> 00:43:47.291
Just hang on. I'll get you down.

538
00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:50.586
Just a second.

539
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:53.464
Oh, I'm sorry!

540
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.093
Ludo, are you hurt?

541
00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:00.846
Ludo?

542
00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:06.935
Friend?

543
00:44:07.103 --> 00:44:11.106
That's right, Ludo. I'm Sarah.

544
00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:13.942
Sarah.

545
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:18.197
Here, let me help you.

546
00:44:18.365 --> 00:44:20.282
Are you okay?

547
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.163
Sarah.

548
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:29.249
Sarah friend.

549
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:31.794
Now, wait, heh. Just a second.

550
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:35.631
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- Hm? What?

551
00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:39.385
I have to get to the castle at the center
of the labyrinth. Do you know the way?

552
00:44:39.678 --> 00:44:43.430
Uh, um... Uh...

553
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:49.478
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?

554
00:44:49.646 --> 00:44:52.189
I wonder if anyone knows
how to get through this labyrinth.

555
00:44:53.316 --> 00:44:57.319
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.

556
00:44:57.487 --> 00:45:01.323
One thing for sure.
She'll never get through the labyrinth.

557
00:45:05.662 --> 00:45:07.121
Hey.

558
00:45:09.499 --> 00:45:11.667
Where did they come from?

559
00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:16.213
What do you think, Ludo?

560
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:19.007
Which shall we choose
out of these two ugly characters?

561
00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:27.015
It's very rude to stare!

562
00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:29.893
I'm sorry. I was just wondering
which door to choose.

563
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.187
- What?
- It's no good asking him.

564
00:45:32.355 --> 00:45:34.481
- He's as deaf as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.

565
00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:37.067
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.

566
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:39.361
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?

567
00:45:39.529 --> 00:45:41.071
Ah.

568
00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:48.370
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?

569
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:51.540
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's deaf as a post.

570
00:45:51.708 --> 00:45:55.419
Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful
conversational companion.

571
00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:57.796
You can talk! All you do is moan!

572
00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.882
No good. Can't hear you.

573
00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:01.800
Oh.

574
00:46:01.968 --> 00:46:03.844
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?

575
00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:06.180
Search me. We're just the knockers.

576
00:46:08.767 --> 00:46:10.392
Oh.

577
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:14.897
- How do I get through?
- Huh?

578
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:18.400
Knock, and the door will open.

579
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.527
Oh.

580
00:46:21.362 --> 00:46:23.489
- Ludo.
- Huh?

581
00:46:27.327 --> 00:46:29.328
I don't want that thing
back in my mouth.

582
00:46:29.496 --> 00:46:31.830
- Come on. I want to knock.
- Uh-uh.

583
00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:37.169
Doesn't want his ring back in his
mouth, eh? Can't say I blame him.

584
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:59.691
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

585
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:10.661
Come on, Ludo.

586
00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:31.723
You're welcome.

587
00:47:35.645 --> 00:47:38.772
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.

588
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.732
He's got my eyes.

589
00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:58.625
Ludo scared.

590
00:47:58.793 --> 00:48:01.420
Oh. Give me your hand.

591
00:48:01.588 --> 00:48:03.171
Come on.

592
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:05.883
Imagine a big thing
like you being scared.

593
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.467
Yeah.

594
00:48:09.012 --> 00:48:11.346
See, Ludo?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

595
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:17.686
Ludo.

596
00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:21.023
Ludo.

597
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.569
Ludo?

598
00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.032
Ludo, where are you?

599
00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.119
Ludo.

600
00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:38.665
Bah!

601
00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:41.126
Hoggle, help!

602
00:48:41.294 --> 00:48:45.422
- I'm coming, Sarah.
- Well, if it isn't you.

603
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:48.216
And, uh, where are you going?

604
00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:49.718
Uh, uh...

605
00:48:49.886 --> 00:48:52.220
Well, the little lady gave me the slip...

606
00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:55.015
...but I just hears her now.

607
00:48:55.183 --> 00:48:58.310
So I was about to lead her
back to the beginning...

608
00:48:58.478 --> 00:49:00.479
...like you told me.

609
00:49:00.647 --> 00:49:02.773
- I see.
- Ludo!

610
00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:05.692
For one moment I thought
you were running to help her.

611
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.404
But no, not after my warnings.

612
00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:12.741
- That would be stupid.
- Oh, you bet it would!

613
00:49:12.909 --> 00:49:16.536
Me help her after your warnings?

614
00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:22.918
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.

615
00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:27.422
I've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.

616
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:30.801
Oh, yes, so they are.

617
00:49:30.969 --> 00:49:33.887
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

618
00:49:34.055 --> 00:49:37.057
I better find them, but first
I'm off to take the little lady...

619
00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:40.102
...back to the beginning of the
labyrinth just like we planned.

620
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:41.895
Wait.

621
00:49:42.063 --> 00:49:44.064
I've got a much better plan, Hoggle.

622
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:47.776
Give her this.

623
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.197
What is it?

624
00:49:52.365 --> 00:49:53.824
It's a present.

625
00:49:53.992 --> 00:49:56.201
It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it?

626
00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:58.036
Oh, now, why the concern?

627
00:49:58.621 --> 00:50:02.916
- Uh... I won't do nothing to harm her.
- Come, come, come, Hogbrain.

628
00:50:03.084 --> 00:50:05.460
I'm surprised at you,
losing your head over a girl.

629
00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:07.462
I ain't lost my head.

630
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.840
You don't think a young girl
could ever like...

631
00:50:10.008 --> 00:50:13.635
...a repulsive little scab
like you, do you?

632
00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:15.721
- She said we was...
- What?

633
00:50:15.888 --> 00:50:18.015
Bosom companions?

634
00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:19.808
Friends?

635
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:23.145
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that, Hoggle...

636
00:50:23.312 --> 00:50:26.356
...or I'll tip you straight
into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

637
00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:28.358
...before you can blink.

638
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.068
Yes. Right.

639
00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.156
And, Hoggle...

640
00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:37.451
...if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.

641
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:39.494
You...? You will?

642
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:41.997
Prince of the Land of Stench.

643
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:49.838
Ludo?

644
00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:54.092
Ludo?

645
00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.139
What's going on?

646
00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:04.770
- What do you want?
- What, us?

647
00:51:06.606 --> 00:51:09.149
We just have to have a good time.

648
00:51:09.317 --> 00:51:10.400
That's right!

649
00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:13.653
Yeah, woo!

650
00:51:48.064 --> 00:51:49.689
Like the man said,
don't lose your head.

651
00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:55.904
Hey, I'm a wild child.

652
00:51:57.907 --> 00:51:59.449
Whoo! Walk tall.

653
00:52:01.536 --> 00:52:03.245
Yeah.

654
00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:09.709
Roll them.

655
00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:11.837
Snake eyes!

656
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:19.427
Hey, lady!

657
00:52:29.772 --> 00:52:30.939
Fore!

658
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:44.786
Bad luck.

659
00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:02.012
Think small.

660
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:05.098
Bang heads!

661
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:08.810
Hey, listen up.

662
00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:15.775
Shake your pretty little head.

663
00:53:17.278 --> 00:53:18.695
Tap your pretty little feet.

664
00:53:19.947 --> 00:53:21.323
Come on! Come on!

665
00:53:23.326 --> 00:53:26.953
Hey, hey! Her head don't come off.

666
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.247
Of course it doesn't!

667
00:53:29.415 --> 00:53:31.625
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.

668
00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:33.627
Where you going
with a head like that?

669
00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:37.839
Hey, man, I know what we can do.
Take off her head!

670
00:53:38.007 --> 00:53:40.217
Yeah, let's take her apart.

671
00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:42.052
Hey, lady, that's his head.

672
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.346
- That's my head!
- That's a friend of mine.

673
00:53:44.513 --> 00:53:47.015
What are you doing?

674
00:53:47.225 --> 00:53:50.560
Hey! Whoa!

675
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:54.856
Hey, lady!

676
00:53:55.024 --> 00:53:57.901
It's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.

677
00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:00.362
You're only allowed
to throw your own head.

678
00:54:00.529 --> 00:54:02.155
Yeah, that's right.

679
00:54:02.323 --> 00:54:04.532
Where's the referee?

680
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.993
Now we got to take your head off.

681
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:11.164
- Somebody stop her.
- Come back, little lady.

682
00:54:11.332 --> 00:54:12.374
Play the game.

683
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:14.709
Yeah, we're going to throw your head.

684
00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:16.878
You can't quit.
The game's not over.

685
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:20.215
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!

686
00:54:20.383 --> 00:54:21.758
We get a free throw.

687
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:24.344
Hey, lady, you want
to take your head off, don't you?

688
00:54:24.512 --> 00:54:25.553
Sure she does.

689
00:54:25.721 --> 00:54:27.389
- Hoggle.
- Grab it!

690
00:54:27.556 --> 00:54:29.266
Don't you want to look like us?

691
00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:30.892
Leave me alone.

692
00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:34.396
It won't hurt! Get a saw!

693
00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:37.399
If you play, we'll take off your arms!

694
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:41.444
- Take off your ear.
- You don't need two ears.

695
00:54:41.612 --> 00:54:43.822
- Game's almost over.
- Down's up.

696
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:48.326
- Shoo! Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.

697
00:54:50.496 --> 00:54:53.456
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!

698
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:57.043
No, no, no!

699
00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:05.719
Hoggle, hold on.

700
00:55:08.848 --> 00:55:10.640
Oh, my God.

701
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:18.440
Ugh. What is it?

702
00:55:18.607 --> 00:55:21.526
The Bog of Eternal Stench!

703
00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:27.282
I've never smelled
anything like it. It's like...

704
00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:36.541
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog of Eternal Stench.

705
00:55:36.709 --> 00:55:38.126
Help!

706
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.505
Hold on.

707
00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:48.678
What did you have to go
and do a thing like that for?

708
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:49.929
- Do what?
- Bleh!

709
00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:55.769
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.

710
00:55:55.936 --> 00:55:58.021
You kissed me.

711
00:56:03.652 --> 00:56:06.446
Oh, my gosh.

712
00:56:06.614 --> 00:56:09.449
Don't pretend to be so hard.

713
00:56:09.617 --> 00:56:13.328
I know you came back to help me,
and I know that you're my friend.

714
00:56:13.496 --> 00:56:15.246
Did not. Am not.

715
00:56:15.414 --> 00:56:18.541
I just come to get me property back.

716
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:20.502
Oh, and, uh...

717
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:23.171
Give you, give you...

718
00:56:23.339 --> 00:56:25.465
Give me what?

719
00:56:32.848 --> 00:56:34.432
Ludo!

720
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.684
Smell!

721
00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:38.603
Where's Hoggle?

722
00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:42.857
Get off of me!

723
00:56:44.026 --> 00:56:45.485
Oh, here.

724
00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:48.238
Hoggle.

725
00:56:48.406 --> 00:56:51.908
Oh, no, it's okay.
This is Ludo. He's a friend too.

726
00:56:52.076 --> 00:56:53.284
A what?

727
00:56:53.452 --> 00:56:55.120
Smell!

728
00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:56.663
You're right.

729
00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:02.210
Oh, my God.

730
00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:06.673
There's a bridge.

731
00:57:06.841 --> 00:57:08.633
Come on.

732
00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:14.639
Watch it.

733
00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:18.476
You step in this stuff
and you'll stink forever.

734
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:21.813
Stop!

735
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:25.942
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.

736
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.236
Without my permission,
no one may cross.

737
00:57:28.404 --> 00:57:31.406
Please, I only have a little time left!

738
00:57:31.574 --> 00:57:33.658
We've gotta get out of this stench.

739
00:57:33.826 --> 00:57:35.910
Smell bad.

740
00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:38.830
- Stench? Of what speaketh thou?
- This smell.

741
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:43.251
- I smell nothing.
- Oh, you're joking.

742
00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:46.129
But I live by my sense of smell.

743
00:57:48.716 --> 00:57:50.800
The air is sweet and fragrant...

744
00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:52.760
...and none may pass
without my permission!

745
00:57:52.928 --> 00:57:55.763
Smell bad.

746
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:58.266
Oh, get out of my way!

747
00:57:58.434 --> 00:58:01.311
I warn thee, I'm sworn to do my duty!

748
00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:05.273
- Come on. Let us get across.
- Hold!

749
00:58:09.737 --> 00:58:12.155
Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you.

750
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:13.865
Hoggle, what are you doing?

751
00:58:14.033 --> 00:58:16.451
Let go of my staff, sir!

752
00:58:16.619 --> 00:58:17.869
Ow!

753
00:58:23.292 --> 00:58:26.878
All right, then.
I can conquer this mountain.

754
00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:36.471
Ow!

755
00:58:48.817 --> 00:58:50.777
Thou must do better than that.

756
00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:54.197
Give up? Huh?

757
00:58:55.491 --> 00:58:57.575
Woo! Woo, woo, woo!

758
00:59:08.546 --> 00:59:10.296
- Enough!
- Huh?

759
00:59:11.632 --> 00:59:14.384
Before this day,
never have I met my match in battle.

760
00:59:14.552 --> 00:59:19.055
Yet this noble knight
has fought me to a standstill.

761
00:59:19.223 --> 00:59:22.684
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!

762
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:26.896
Sir Ludo, if that's thy name,
now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

763
00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:29.899
Come, let us be brothers henceforth...

764
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:32.694
...and fight for the right as one!

765
00:59:34.697 --> 00:59:38.032
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.

766
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.242
Steady.

767
00:59:40.494 --> 00:59:42.954
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.

768
00:59:43.122 --> 00:59:46.541
Wait a minute!
You forget my sacred vow, my lady.

769
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:50.378
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you just said Ludo is your brother.

770
00:59:50.546 --> 00:59:53.881
I have taken an oath,
and I must defend it to the death.

771
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:56.718
- The smell!
- Okay.

772
00:59:56.885 --> 01:00:00.263
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?

773
01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:04.434
I have sworn with my lifeblood
no one shall pass this way...

774
01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.853
...without my permission.

775
01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:12.358
Well, may we have
your permission?

776
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:14.944
Well, I, uh...

777
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.913
- Yes?
- Thank you, noble sir.

778
01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.415
My lady.

779
01:00:31.045 --> 01:00:33.921
- Uh-oh.
- Have no fear, sweet lady.

780
01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.424
This bridge has lasted
for a thousand years.

781
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.761
No!

782
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.062
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!

783
01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.902
Fear not, fair maiden. I will save thee.

784
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.111
Somehow.

785
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:03.284
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl
when yon maiden needs our help?

786
01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.942
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!

787
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.319
Canst thou summon up
the very rocks?

788
01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:42.532
Sure. Rocks friends.

789
01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.327
Hoggle.

790
01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:50.289
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.

791
01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.212
Be careful, Ludo.

792
01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.388
Sir Ludo, wait for me.

793
01:02:05.556 --> 01:02:09.726
Ambrosius. It's all right,
Ambrosius. You can come out now.

794
01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:13.354
Come on. Thattaboy.

795
01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.357
My loyal steed. Steady.

796
01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:22.488
Forward. Steady, steady, boy.

797
01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:26.117
Come on, Ambrosius.
Just close your eyes and go.

798
01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:31.831
Let's get out of here.

799
01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.545
Excuse us. Thank you.

800
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.888
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

801
01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:50.516
Oh, please, I can't give it to her.

802
01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:57.774
Well, come on, then.
We'll reach the castle well before day.

803
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.117
Look, Sarah, is this
what you're trying to find?

804
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:14.290
So much trouble over such
a little thing, but not for long.

805
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:18.836
She'll soon forget all
about you, my fine fellow.

806
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.048
Just as soon as Hoggle
gives her my present...

807
01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:25.384
...then she'll forget everything.

808
01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:29.931
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosius?

809
01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:33.518
Hungry.

810
01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:38.231
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

811
01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:41.275
Maybe we can find
some berries or something.

812
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.444
Sarah.

813
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.072
Yeah?

814
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.406
Here.

815
01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:49.242
Hoggle.

816
01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:52.286
Oh, thank you!

817
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.539
You're a lifesaver.

818
01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.508
This tastes strange.

819
01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:18.563
- Hoggle, what have you done?
- Oh, damn you, Jareth.

820
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.107
And damn me too.

821
01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.495
Everything's dancing.

822
01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:42.772
Yea, verily. Whoa, Ambrosius, whoa!

823
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.151
The castle doth lie yonder, my lady.

824
01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.028
My lady?

825
01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:53.115
My lady? My lady?

826
01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:48.726
Oh. She'll never forgive me.

827
01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:50.895
What have I done?

828
01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.981
I've lost my only friend.

829
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:56.192
That's what I've done.

830
01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.662
What was I doing?

831
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:18.964
Ew. Ugh.

832
01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:22.676
Ow. Get off my back!

833
01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.681
Why don't you look
where you're going...

834
01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.600
...young woman, hm?

835
01:10:31.269 --> 01:10:34.230
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?

836
01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.358
And where were you going, hm?

837
01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.193
I don't remember.

838
01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:42.529
You can't look where you're going
if you don't know where you're going.

839
01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.323
I was searching for something.

840
01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.784
Well, look here.

841
01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:48.702
Ooh.

842
01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:54.083
Lancelot?

843
01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.210
Thank you.

844
01:10:56.378 --> 01:11:00.756
That's what you were looking for.
Wasn't it, my dear?

845
01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.968
Yes. I forgot.

846
01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:07.054
Now, why don't you...

847
01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:09.390
...come in here...

848
01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:12.393
...and see if there's anything else...

849
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.853
...you'd like. Hm?

850
01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.386
It was just a dream.

851
01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:52.641
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.

852
01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.979
But it was so real.

853
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.776
Let's go see if Daddy's back, okay?

854
01:12:08.033 --> 01:12:10.451
Better to stay in here, dear. Yes.

855
01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.955
There's nothing you want
out there. No! Oh, no.

856
01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.958
Ooh, what have we got here?

857
01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:19.501
Lancelot.

858
01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:23.130
Oh, your little bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.

859
01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:25.466
Don't you? Yes, yes, yes.
There you go.

860
01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.052
Ooh, and there's Betsy Boo.
You remember Betsy Boo, don't you?

861
01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:29.970
Yes, yes, yes.

862
01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:33.474
Now, then, what else have we got?
What's this? Ooh, let's have a look.

863
01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:36.185
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.

864
01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:40.689
Here's your panda slippers. You know
how much you like your panda slippers.

865
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.318
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right. That's right.

866
01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:48.113
Okay. Now, then, what else?
Oh, it's little Horsy.

867
01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.616
You love little Horsy, don't you, dear?

868
01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:54.787
And look at this! You got
a printing game, you have.

869
01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:58.540
Oh, here's a treasure.
You'll want that. Won't you, my dear?

870
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.461
Yes, go on. Put it on.
Make yourself up.

871
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:06.048
And here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her, right? There you go.

872
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:10.010
Oh, yes. Ah. Oh, yes.

873
01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:13.847
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear for you.

874
01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.849
There was something
I was looking for.

875
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.728
Don't talk nonsense. It's all here.

876
01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:23.565
Everything in the world you've
ever cared about is all right here.

877
01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.026
Look, there's your little toy candy shop.

878
01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:27.486
"Through dangers untold...

879
01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:30.364
...and hardships unnumbered...

880
01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:34.785
...I fought my way here
to the castle...

881
01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:37.496
...beyond the Goblin City...

882
01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:40.958
...to take back the child
that you have stolen."

883
01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:45.921
Huh? Huh? What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?

884
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.090
It's all junk.

885
01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:51.885
Well, what about this?

886
01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:55.931
This is not junk, eh?

887
01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:59.309
Yes, it is!

888
01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:03.105
I have to save Toby!

889
01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:08.861
My lady!

890
01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.157
- Sarah. Sarah.
- Are you all right?

891
01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:17.619
- My lady.
- Sarah.

892
01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.499
Fair maiden. Thank goodness
thou art safe at last.

893
01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.793
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.

894
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.296
My lady, look, we're almost there.

895
01:14:27.464 --> 01:14:29.840
Those are the gates to the Goblin City.

896
01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:32.134
Ludo, Sir Didymus.

897
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.929
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.

898
01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.307
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosius.

899
01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.392
Forward.

900
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.935
No, no!

901
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.357
Open up. Open the door.

902
01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.651
Shh. Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.

903
01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.655
Open up. Open up right now!

904
01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.240
Sir Didymus, you'll wake the guard.

905
01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:56.617
Quiet.

906
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.536
Well, let them all wake up!

907
01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:03.081
- Shh.
- I shall fight you all to the death!

908
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.962
Please, Sir Didymus,
for my sake, hush.

909
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.173
But of course. For thee, anything.

910
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.634
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.

911
01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.844
- And my sense of smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.

912
01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.556
Then I shall fight anyone
anywhere, any place, anytime!

913
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.475
Yes, yes, we know, we know!

914
01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:23.018
Now, hush.

915
01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.022
Quietly.

916
01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.608
Ambrosius, be quiet, now.

917
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.195
I don't see why we have to be so quiet.

918
01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:35.489
It's only a Goblin City.

919
01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:37.533
I smell trouble.

920
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.790
Come on, Ludo.

921
01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.501
Oh, no.

922
01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:53.340
What is that?

923
01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:59.513
Who goes?

924
01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.979
Who goes?

925
01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:14.111
Who goes?

926
01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:23.912
Watch out!

927
01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.628
Ambrosius!

928
01:16:37.719 --> 01:16:39.886
Ambrosius, will you come here.

929
01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.808
Ambrosius, come here right now!

930
01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:48.270
Will you please come.
Oh, but you're embarrassing me.

931
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:53.942
Careful, Ludo.

932
01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:56.528
- Hoggle!
- Huh?

933
01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:05.120
Look out!

934
01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.458
Get out of there.

935
01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:12.711
What are you doing?

936
01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.255
Bombs away!

937
01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.637
That wasn't very nice.

938
01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:24.640
My turn now.

939
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.602
How do you drive this thing?

940
01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.441
Drop the ax!

941
01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:36.777
I'm trying.

942
01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:39.154
Come here at once.

943
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.326
Where's reverse?

944
01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:54.378
Get out of there, Hoggle!

945
01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.254
Abandon ship.

946
01:18:00.385 --> 01:18:01.843
Hoggle!

947
01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:07.099
Hoggle, are you all right?

948
01:18:08.226 --> 01:18:11.853
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed of nothing I did.

949
01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.440
Jareth made me give you that peach.

950
01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:19.152
I don't care what you think of me.
I told you I was a coward.

951
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.279
And I ain't interested in being friends.

952
01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:24.116
I forgive you, Hoggle.

953
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.911
You...? You do?

954
01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:32.791
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.

955
01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:36.169
You are a valiant man, Sir Hoggle.

956
01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.880
I am?

957
01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.466
Hoggle and Ludo friends.

958
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.178
We are?

959
01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:46.847
Here are your things, Hoggle.

960
01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:49.391
Thanks for your help.

961
01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:52.978
Well, what are we waiting for?

962
01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:55.564
Let's get the rat
who calls himself Jareth.

963
01:18:55.732 --> 01:18:57.190
Right. Come on.

964
01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:00.235
Ambrosius, it's safe now.
Nothing to be afraid of.

965
01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:28.221
Your Highness!

966
01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:29.514
Your Highness.

967
01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:32.350
Your Highness, the girl...

968
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.102
- What?
- The girl who ate the peach...

969
01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:36.688
- ...and forgot everything...
- What of her?

970
01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:39.775
She's here with the monster, Sir Didymus
and the dwarf who worked for you.

971
01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.401
- What?
- They got through the gates...

972
01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:42.944
...and they're on their way
to the castle!

973
01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:47.032
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.

974
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.035
- Guards!
- She must be stopped.

975
01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:51.328
Do something!

976
01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.415
Come on, move. Move!

977
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.178
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Oh, piece of cake.

978
01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:17.813
Company, halt.

979
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:27.364
Lances ready!

980
01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.577
Cannon, fire!

981
01:20:38.543 --> 01:20:41.294
Ambrosius, turn around.
Ambrosius, turn about.

982
01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:44.172
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!

983
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.801
No, not that way!

984
01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:52.973
You're going the wrong way!

985
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.016
The battle's behind us!

986
01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.732
Ambrosius, can we
please talk about this?

987
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.317
Sit!

988
01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:11.324
Be careful. Okay.

989
01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:12.868
Through here.

990
01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:19.332
Ambrosius, stand still.

991
01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:22.168
Okay, come on, guys.

992
01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.464
Ambrosius, if you don't
turn around this second...

993
01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:28.508
...I will never feed you again.

994
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.054
That's better.

995
01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:37.684
Don't worry, Ambrosius.
I think we've got them surrounded.

996
01:21:40.730 --> 01:21:43.356
Didymus! Where's Didymus?

997
01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.901
Fire!

998
01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:49.905
I hit something, yes? No?

999
01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:53.742
We've got to find Didymus.

1000
01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:57.662
Down this way.

1001
01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:17.891
Charge!

1002
01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:26.733
Tallyho!

1003
01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:28.485
Ah!

1004
01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.198
Ambrosius, you coward.

1005
01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.872
Ambrosius!

1006
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.585
Quick, in here.

1007
01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:47.545
How's Ludo gonna get in?

1008
01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:11.403
You in there, you're surrounded!

1009
01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:13.989
Surrounded?

1010
01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:18.785
Get out! Ludo, call the rocks!

1011
01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:20.203
Huh?

1012
01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:32.674
- Take that!
- Hungry?

1013
01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.095
Ludo!

1014
01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:40.849
Ambrosius, unlock this door.

1015
01:23:46.731 --> 01:23:49.190
So had enough, have you?

1016
01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.945
All right, then, throw down your weapons,
and I'll see that you're well treated.

1017
01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:56.656
Hi-yah!

1018
01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:58.074
Ludo!

1019
01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.475
Next time, surrender.

1020
01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.320
Good grief!

1021
01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:41.576
Steady, men.

1022
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:46.456
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

1023
01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:54.214
Okay, I take it back.
Run for your lives!

1024
01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:57.550
I've had enough! I'm going to bed.

1025
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.721
Get out of my house!

1026
01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:26.162
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!

1027
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:30.458
Missed!

1028
01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.418
Okay, come on.

1029
01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:36.339
Fire!

1030
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.844
Hey, I just fired you.

1031
01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:42.720
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1032
01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:47.100
This way.

1033
01:25:51.564 --> 01:25:52.647
Now we have you!

1034
01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:56.276
And now you don't.

1035
01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.879
Hey, no problem.

1036
01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:22.010
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!

1037
01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:26.973
Hi-ho, Silver!

1038
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.486
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella.
- This way.

1039
01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.071
Steady, boy.

1040
01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:47.327
Ah, yes. Up you go. Up, up.

1041
01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:51.497
Come on. Good boy.

1042
01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.499
Come on.

1043
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:54.834
No.

1044
01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:56.836
Good boy. Come on.

1045
01:26:57.755 --> 01:27:00.465
- That's the only way he could've gone.
- Well then, come on.

1046
01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.759
No, no. I have to face him alone.

1047
01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:04.886
- But why?
- Yes.

1048
01:27:05.054 --> 01:27:07.096
Because that's the way it's done.

1049
01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.724
Well, if that is the way it is done...

1050
01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.060
...then that is the way you must do it.

1051
01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:15.021
But should you need us...

1052
01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:18.233
Yes, should you need us...

1053
01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.777
I'll call.

1054
01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.696
Thank you, all of you.

1055
01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.655
Toby!

1056
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.556
Toby!

1057
01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:01.104
Toby.

1058
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.790
Toby.

1059
01:30:56.535 --> 01:30:58.411
Give me the child.

1060
01:30:58.579 --> 01:31:00.788
Sarah, beware.

1061
01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:05.084
I have been generous up until now,
and I can be cruel.

1062
01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:06.669
Generous?

1063
01:31:08.881 --> 01:31:12.133
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!

1064
01:31:12.301 --> 01:31:15.136
Everything that you wanted,
I have done.

1065
01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:19.140
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.

1066
01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:22.518
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.

1067
01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.937
I have reordered time...

1068
01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.773
...I have turned the world
upside down...

1069
01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:30.485
...and I have done it all for you.

1070
01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:36.032
I am exhausted from living up
to your expectations of me.

1071
01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.366
Isn't that generous?

1072
01:31:40.913 --> 01:31:45.166
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

1073
01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:50.421
...I have fought my way here to
the castle beyond the Goblin City.

1074
01:31:52.216 --> 01:31:54.133
For my will
is as strong as yours...

1075
01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:58.387
- ...and my...
- Stop. Wait.

1076
01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:00.097
Look, Sarah.

1077
01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:03.851
Look what I'm offering you.

1078
01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.478
Your dreams.

1079
01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.191
And my kingdom as great.

1080
01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:13.110
I ask for so little.

1081
01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:15.696
Just let me rule you...

1082
01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:19.283
...and you can have everything
that you want.

1083
01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:25.456
Kingdom as great.

1084
01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:26.832
Damn.

1085
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.168
I can never remember that line.

1086
01:32:29.336 --> 01:32:33.047
Just fear me, love me, do as I say...

1087
01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.591
...and I will be your slave.

1088
01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:40.721
My kingdom as great.
My kingdom as great.

1089
01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:49.897
You have no power over me.

1090
01:32:51.692 --> 01:32:54.694
You have no power over me.

1091
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.947
Toby.

1092
01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:44.410
Toby! Toby.

1093
01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:46.912
Toby.

1094
01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:18.069
Here you are.

1095
01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:21.155
I'd like Lancelot
to belong to you now.

1096
01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.013
We're home.

1097
01:34:52.813 --> 01:34:54.855
Sarah, are you home?

1098
01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:58.192
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.

1099
01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.322
Goodbye, Sarah.

1100
01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:14.458
And remember, fair maiden...

1101
01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:16.502
...should you need us...

1102
01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:19.880
Yes, should you need us...

1103
01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.842
...for any reason at all...

1104
01:35:23.009 --> 01:35:25.386
I need you, Hoggle.

1105
01:35:25.554 --> 01:35:26.971
You do?

1106
01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.725
I don't know why, but...

1107
01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:33.394
...every now and again in my life...

1108
01:35:33.562 --> 01:35:36.856
...for no reason at all, I need you.

1109
01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:40.609
- All of you.
- Uh... You do?

1110
01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:44.071
Well, why didn't you say so?

1111
01:35:55.459 --> 01:35:57.543
- Ludo!
- Sarah.

1112
01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:01.297
Ambrosius, good boy, good boy.

1113
01:36:08.305 --> 01:36:10.931
I say, does anyone here
want to play a game of Scrabble?

1114
01:36:32.412 --> 01:36:34.622
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

1115
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:36.457
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

1116
01:36:36.625 --> 01:36:38.125
- The power of voodoo.
- Who do?

1117
01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:39.460
- You do.
- Do what?

1118
01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:41.962
Remind me of the babe.
