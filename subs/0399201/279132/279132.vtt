1
00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.421
You're special.

2
00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:58.593
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

3
00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:02.138
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:16.027
The Island awaits you.

5
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.955
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6
00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:39.152
<i>Good morning, Tower One.</i>

7
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.655
<i>Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.</i>

8
00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.240
<i>Sunny and mild.</i>

9
00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:57.420
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:04:01.383 --> 00:04:04.844
<i>And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.</i>

11
00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:17.357
- Morning.
- Morning.

12
00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.535
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.298
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.801
Thank you.

15
00:04:45.677 --> 00:04:47.512
We're full.

16
00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:54.727
<i>Good morning. July 19, 2019.</i>

17
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.604
Another day in paradise.

18
00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:14.163
<i>Starkweather Two Delta,
your time has come.</i>

19
00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:17.542
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

20
00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:19.294
<i>Starkweather Two Delta here.</i>

21
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.964
<i>And as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.</i>

22
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:27.886
<i>I mean, I've only been with you guys for,
like, six months, but I won the lottery.</i>

23
00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:30.054
<i>- That's right, me.
- Six months.</i>

24
00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.642
<i>To go out and breathe fresh air.
Swim in the ocean.</i>

25
00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:38.813
<i>I can't believe I won.
You call me Mr. Popular, I know.</i>

26
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.774
<i>It's me. It's me.</i>

27
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.028
<i>You guys know I'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.</i>

28
00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:50.366
<i>I'm going to The Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!</i>

29
00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.828
<i>But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it. I won!</i>

30
00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:55.371
<i>That was this week's winner...</i>

31
00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:57.915
We got a disturbance on elevator 12,
plaza level.

32
00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.711
<i>- Just moments before his final
departure to The Island...</i>

33
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.839
<i>... nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.</i>

34
00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:07.383
Lucky guy, huh? Don't you think?

35
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.179
<i>The next lottery is tonight.</i>

36
00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:15.391
"The next lottery is tonight."

37
00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:20.396
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

38
00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.067
- What about you?
- Three.

39
00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:26.361
Three. I've been here seven.

40
00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:30.448
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

41
00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:34.535
I'm such a loser.

42
00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:06.692
Sir.

43
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.903
Yeah, you.

44
00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:12.490
Swipe.

45
00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:17.537
Gandu Three Echo. You've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

46
00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:20.623
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

47
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.085
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

48
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:25.878
I'm feeling much better.

49
00:07:26.087 --> 00:07:27.880
- Then have a pleasant day.
- You too.

50
00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:30.967
You both have a pleasant day too.

51
00:07:53.364 --> 00:07:54.657
Stretch.

52
00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:57.743
One more breath in.

53
00:08:18.806 --> 00:08:20.391
- Listen.
- I tried to do better.

54
00:08:21.684 --> 00:08:26.397
<i>Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.</i>

55
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:29.942
<i>A healthy person is a happy person.</i>

56
00:08:37.158 --> 00:08:40.912
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

57
00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:43.122
No bacon today?

58
00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.333
You got a nutrition flag.
Means no bacon.

59
00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:49.045
Then I'll have two eggs, over easy,
not too runny, and a side of sausages.

60
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:51.714
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

61
00:08:52.673 --> 00:08:56.010
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

62
00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.430
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- Move it.

63
00:09:02.683 --> 00:09:04.727
Surprise me.

64
00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.484
Surprise.

65
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.612
Yummy. Next.

66
00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.168
Watch and learn.

67
00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:32.213
Next.

68
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.298
Jordan Two Delta.

69
00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:36.300
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

70
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:39.970
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

71
00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:42.807
- Eggs, please.
- Okay.

72
00:09:44.308 --> 00:09:46.977
So where were you the other day?
We missed you.

73
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.690
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

74
00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:53.025
Get you anything else?

75
00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:55.319
Maybe a little bacon.

76
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.115
- No, it says I shouldn't.
- Go ahead.

77
00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:01.784
Four... Five pieces, please.

78
00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.745
Thank you.

79
00:10:12.086 --> 00:10:14.797
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

80
00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:16.382
Back on your diet, huh?

81
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.925
You kidding? I love this.

82
00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:20.636
Better eat up.
You'll need your strength tonight.

83
00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:24.181
- Is that a challenge?
- I promise I'll go easy on you.

84
00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:30.020
Please separate. Find your seats now.

85
00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.443
"'Who wants Sally?' said Dick.

86
00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:37.820
'I do,' said Jane.

87
00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:40.739
'I cannot find Sally.

88
00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:45.327
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.'

89
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.955
'Is Sally here?'"

90
00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.928
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

91
00:11:07.725 --> 00:11:10.728
What did you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

92
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.858
Sir?

93
00:11:16.192 --> 00:11:17.860
You wanted to see me?

94
00:11:18.027 --> 00:11:20.821
Yes. Please.

95
00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:30.998
Please sit down.

96
00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:34.877
So how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

97
00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.213
Not so good, I guess.

98
00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:39.673
Why do you say that?

99
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.468
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

100
00:11:42.843 --> 00:11:45.679
That's a rather negative association.

101
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.059
My only job is to see that you're happy,
that things are okay with you.

102
00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.685
Right.

103
00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:57.942
Your file shows that you've been
interacting regularly...

104
00:11:58.108 --> 00:11:59.443
...with Jordan Two Delta.

105
00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:01.528
There's no law against friendship.

106
00:12:01.695 --> 00:12:07.910
No, we encourage it, but obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

107
00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:09.912
I know the rules of proximity.

108
00:12:12.373 --> 00:12:15.084
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

109
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.045
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

110
00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:21.674
But screening has picked up
some trace levels...

111
00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:25.844
...changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

112
00:12:26.387 --> 00:12:28.722
Are you saying there's something
wrong with me?

113
00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:31.600
Why don't you tell me
about your dream.

114
00:12:32.393 --> 00:12:36.563
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to The Island.

115
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.817
A boat? What kind of boat?

116
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.695
A nice boat.

117
00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:44.321
Draw it for me, would you?

118
00:12:49.952 --> 00:12:53.497
So you're heading toward The Island.

119
00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:55.416
What happens then?

120
00:12:55.582 --> 00:12:56.959
I drown.

121
00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.794
Really?

122
00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:00.796
Why do you think that is?

123
00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:02.798
I don't know. You tell me.

124
00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:05.509
- Are you afraid of winning?
- Why would I be afraid of winning?

125
00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:07.302
You tell me.

126
00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:14.768
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

127
00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:18.647
Well, it's...

128
00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:20.691
It's just...

129
00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:24.153
All right. Tuesday night is tofu night...

130
00:13:24.319 --> 00:13:28.031
...and I'm asking myself, "Who decided
that everyone here likes tofu?"

131
00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:29.908
And what is tofu, anyway?

132
00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:31.952
And why can't I have bacon?

133
00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:35.456
I line up every morning and I'm not
allowed bacon for my breakfast.

134
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.709
And tell me...
Let's talk about all the white.

135
00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:40.711
Why is everyone
always wearing white?

136
00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:42.379
It's impossible to keep clean.

137
00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:45.507
I always get the gray stripe.
I never get any color.

138
00:13:45.716 --> 00:13:48.802
And I hand it in to be cleaned,
and someone cleans it...

139
00:13:48.969 --> 00:13:51.346
...and folds it neatly back in my drawer,
but who?

140
00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:53.807
Who is that person? I don't know.

141
00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:58.979
I just... I wanna know answers,
and I wish that there was more.

142
00:14:00.397 --> 00:14:01.857
More?

143
00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:06.278
Yeah. More than just waiting
to go to The Island.

144
00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:10.949
Lincoln...

145
00:14:11.867 --> 00:14:14.786
...it's your nature to question things.

146
00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:17.664
But don't you realize
how lucky you are?

147
00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:19.625
That you survived the contamination.

148
00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:23.712
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

149
00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:26.924
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

150
00:14:31.178 --> 00:14:35.015
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to The Island too?

151
00:14:35.557 --> 00:14:37.142
No.

152
00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:43.023
My responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate.

153
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:48.528
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

154
00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:51.114
We can't win the lottery.

155
00:14:54.534 --> 00:14:56.662
Let me see that.

156
00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:00.415
You draw well.

157
00:15:00.582 --> 00:15:01.875
<i>"Renovatio."</i>

158
00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:05.545
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It's always in my dream.

159
00:15:08.257 --> 00:15:10.342
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

160
00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:15.514
- What sort of tests?
- Nice tests.

161
00:15:16.264 --> 00:15:17.474
Come with me.

162
00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:26.483
Take a seat.

163
00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:34.950
Okay, let's get you comfortable.
Swing back.

164
00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:43.333
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

165
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.419
Totally harmless.

166
00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:48.422
Don't worry, it's painless.

167
00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.027
- It hurts.
- Not really.

168
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.821
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

169
00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:15.282
Yeah, it really, really does!

170
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.540
The microsensors will move along
your optic nerve.

171
00:16:24.124 --> 00:16:27.169
They'll be uploading readings to us
over the next 24 hours...

172
00:16:27.335 --> 00:16:29.880
...after which you'll pass them
through your urine.

173
00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:32.257
Now, that might hurt.

174
00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:45.061
Six Echo, you're late.

175
00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:02.787
- Jones, you ever get bored doing this?
- Doing what?

176
00:17:02.954 --> 00:17:04.915
- This.
- I never really thought about it.

177
00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:06.791
- I think about it a lot.
- About what?

178
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.711
This boring job.
What are we doing here, anyway?

179
00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:11.630
We're feeding the nutrient lines.

180
00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:14.466
We eat food,
food's gotta have vitamins, right?

181
00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:17.886
- It's good for us.
- You don't ever wonder about anything?

182
00:17:18.094 --> 00:17:20.430
Where do these tubes go?

183
00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:26.228
They start there.
And they go... right there.

184
00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:30.232
Hey, did you get a look
at the new guy?

185
00:17:30.565 --> 00:17:32.567
Seven Foxtrot.

186
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:34.319
They found another survivor.

187
00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:37.989
- They keep finding them.
- He'll probably win the lottery tomorrow.

188
00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:40.200
Straight down, in the hole.

189
00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:42.494
There you go, you try it.
Straight down.

190
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.871
- In...
- In the hole.

191
00:17:45.038 --> 00:17:48.875
In the hole. No, no. No. No.
Put it down.

192
00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:52.003
Did we look that stupid when
we went through decontamination?

193
00:17:52.212 --> 00:17:56.675
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-the-Questions,
let me ask you this.

194
00:17:58.051 --> 00:18:00.845
- Lottery's supposed to be random, right?
- Right.

195
00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:04.140
What if it's not? What if it's rigged?

196
00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:05.892
Rigged?

197
00:18:06.851 --> 00:18:08.728
I've been working on this. Here.

198
00:18:09.312 --> 00:18:10.772
Take a look at that.

199
00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:14.651
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on The Island.

200
00:18:14.818 --> 00:18:17.988
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

201
00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:20.865
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

202
00:18:21.283 --> 00:18:24.244
I assigned it a point value
based on its alphabet position.

203
00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:26.579
Like the last, Starkweather,
S equals 15.

204
00:18:26.788 --> 00:18:30.041
Q equals 15, S equals 19.
Do you see what I'm saying?

205
00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.210
- No.
- Maybe if you would listen to me.

206
00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.087
I'm trying to tell you.

207
00:18:34.254 --> 00:18:37.215
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

208
00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:41.011
You multiply it by the amount...
You divide it by the amount of peop...

209
00:18:41.219 --> 00:18:43.013
Divide by the amount
of people here.

210
00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:46.766
Which is 25... A thousand plus 5... 2500.
You know what that spells?

211
00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:49.394
J-O-N-E-S.

212
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.064
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

213
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:56.026
- No.
- Gentlemen...

214
00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:59.571
...I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

215
00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:01.823
There you go. Straight...

216
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.160
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go.

217
00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:10.206
- He had something on his...
- Go.

218
00:19:15.712 --> 00:19:17.338
Lima! Are you okay?

219
00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:21.009
Code 15! We need med-techs
down here, stat! Lima One Alpha.

220
00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:22.844
Just give her some air, okay?

221
00:19:23.136 --> 00:19:25.555
You're gonna be okay.
Just relax and breathe.

222
00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:29.476
Can I get a wheelchair down here,
please? It's for Lima One Alpha.

223
00:19:30.143 --> 00:19:31.853
I think it's time.

224
00:19:34.189 --> 00:19:37.358
Lima. You're going to The Island.

225
00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:40.403
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

226
00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:42.363
I hope I see you soon.

227
00:19:45.158 --> 00:19:46.743
Everyone, please follow her out.

228
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:49.704
Quickly and carefully.
Watch the glass.

229
00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:52.415
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:56.544 --> 00:19:58.922
That's fair. That's real fair.

231
00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.425
Ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen, thank you.

232
00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:08.556
Everyone, back to work.

233
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.100
That is so not fair!

234
00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:15.480
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

235
00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.440
Tech Services.

236
00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:19.484
Computer's down again.

237
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.529
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

238
00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:24.948
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-key.

239
00:20:25.114 --> 00:20:28.034
- Contamination kit. Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

240
00:20:57.021 --> 00:20:59.691
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

241
00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:04.737
Hey, we've got live wires
all over the place here.

242
00:21:04.946 --> 00:21:08.157
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

243
00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:10.493
- What?
- I've been looking all over...

244
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.288
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

245
00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:17.750
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

246
00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:20.670
- How you doing, Mac?
- What are you doing here?

247
00:21:21.045 --> 00:21:22.380
My chip fried again.

248
00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:26.592
Yeah, your chip fried. How much longer
you think that one's gonna work?

249
00:21:27.844 --> 00:21:29.470
What are you clowns looking at?

250
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:32.890
Hey, got any of that stuff
on you today?

251
00:21:33.766 --> 00:21:36.352
Oh, look, it's break time. Come on.

252
00:21:38.146 --> 00:21:40.606
You're a bad influence on me.

253
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.651
Must be why I like you so much.

254
00:21:47.655 --> 00:21:51.159
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

255
00:21:52.118 --> 00:21:55.872
Well, it's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

256
00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:01.794
I like coming out here, talking.

257
00:22:02.795 --> 00:22:04.839
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

258
00:22:05.048 --> 00:22:06.632
Yeah.

259
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.927
Step into my office.

260
00:22:16.184 --> 00:22:19.020
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

261
00:22:19.228 --> 00:22:21.022
Where are their clothes?

262
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.899
Hey, what's with Dr. Merrick?

263
00:22:23.066 --> 00:22:27.278
You mean, why does he act like he's got
a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

264
00:22:27.445 --> 00:22:31.240
- Yeah.
- It's called a "God complex."

265
00:22:31.407 --> 00:22:33.785
Doctors are like that.
Think they know everything.

266
00:22:33.993 --> 00:22:35.745
What's God?

267
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.958
You know when you want something
really bad and you wish for it?

268
00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:42.919
God's the guy that ignores you.

269
00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:45.213
Oh, right.

270
00:22:45.588 --> 00:22:48.007
<i>Tech service requested
in Product Extraction.</i>

271
00:22:48.174 --> 00:22:50.218
Yeah, I'll be right there.

272
00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:56.182
Oh, hey, let me get that.

273
00:22:57.058 --> 00:22:59.477
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

274
00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:02.438
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

275
00:23:02.605 --> 00:23:04.565
You mean from before
the contamination?

276
00:23:04.732 --> 00:23:07.902
Yeah. Come on,
you're killing me with questions here.

277
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.946
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

278
00:23:10.112 --> 00:23:13.241
Because you're, you know,
like, special.

279
00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:15.117
Why? Why am I special?

280
00:23:15.785 --> 00:23:17.578
There's another question.

281
00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:22.291
You remember what we talked about?
You don't tell anybody about our conversations?

282
00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:24.126
- No.
- That'll get me in big trouble.

283
00:23:24.293 --> 00:23:25.711
No, I don't.

284
00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:28.005
Good.

285
00:24:09.422 --> 00:24:12.216
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

286
00:24:13.342 --> 00:24:15.052
Okay, I'll catch you later.

287
00:24:19.265 --> 00:24:21.309
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

288
00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:22.893
Yep.

289
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.062
What a surprise.

290
00:24:27.607 --> 00:24:29.400
Go hot.

291
00:24:33.112 --> 00:24:36.240
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

292
00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:41.245
You'd think with all the money this place 
is raking in, they could afford decent equipment.

293
00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:43.289
Yeah. Ready?

294
00:24:46.459 --> 00:24:48.336
Cut the O2.

295
00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:53.424
Seriously, unless you wanna see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

296
00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:55.676
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

297
00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:20.576
Breathe!

298
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.954
Come on, yeah. That's it.

299
00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:28.709
Come on, breathe.

300
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:31.796
Come on.

301
00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:34.507
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

302
00:25:35.382 --> 00:25:38.594
There we go. Now we're working.
He's healthy.

303
00:25:41.722 --> 00:25:43.224
Welcome to the world.

304
00:25:47.394 --> 00:25:50.648
- So how's Three Hilo?
- Good.

305
00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:55.319
He's feisty. Light.

306
00:25:56.737 --> 00:25:59.615
Vitals seem fine.

307
00:26:00.324 --> 00:26:02.868
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

308
00:26:05.704 --> 00:26:08.040
Looks like we have a fine product.

309
00:26:08.415 --> 00:26:10.459
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

310
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.538
Little bug.

311
00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:19.755
Next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

312
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:29.431
It was very sad.

313
00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:31.433
- Hey.
- Hello.

314
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.976
Hi.

315
00:28:34.645 --> 00:28:37.314
You just let a little girl
beat you, huh?

316
00:28:39.483 --> 00:28:40.818
Stim units restricted.

317
00:28:41.026 --> 00:28:43.070
Yeah, yeah. I'll have the veggie stuff.

318
00:28:43.237 --> 00:28:45.948
Papassian petal juice, please.

319
00:28:46.115 --> 00:28:47.574
It's good for the skin.

320
00:29:00.212 --> 00:29:02.089
Jordan, are you sick?

321
00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:07.177
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

322
00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:09.596
No, I'm fine.

323
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.473
Okay.

324
00:29:12.307 --> 00:29:14.017
How are you?

325
00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:15.853
I'm fine.

326
00:29:16.645 --> 00:29:21.525
Lincoln, I can tell when you lie because
your mouth smiles but your eyes don't.

327
00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:25.571
- I found something.
- What?

328
00:29:25.737 --> 00:29:27.698
- A bug.
- A bug?

329
00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:29.908
- A flying bug.
- Can I see it?

330
00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:32.369
I think it came in the ventilation shaft.

331
00:29:32.536 --> 00:29:34.746
But they went extinct
with the contamination.

332
00:29:34.955 --> 00:29:37.499
I know. And how did it get
by the pathogen sensors?

333
00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:40.043
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

334
00:29:40.252 --> 00:29:43.213
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

335
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.341
They keep finding people and bringing
them here. From where?

336
00:29:46.842 --> 00:29:49.511
It's good that they find survivors.

337
00:29:49.678 --> 00:29:53.432
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

338
00:29:53.599 --> 00:29:56.101
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

339
00:29:57.352 --> 00:29:59.688
Good things do happen.

340
00:29:59.855 --> 00:30:01.773
I wanna see that bug.

341
00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:06.361
Hey, Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

342
00:30:06.528 --> 00:30:08.739
- What?
- "Dude."

343
00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:12.576
- "Dude"? What does it mean?
- I don't know. He just called me "dude."

344
00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:14.578
- Hey, dude.
- He said, "Hey, dude"?

345
00:30:14.745 --> 00:30:16.538
Hey, dude. D-O-O-D. "Dood."

346
00:30:16.705 --> 00:30:18.290
- Hey, dood.
- Dood.

347
00:30:18.498 --> 00:30:19.708
Lottery's starting.

348
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:21.960
- Like you stand a chance.
- Dude.

349
00:30:23.253 --> 00:30:26.006
Light up all etherscreens.

350
00:30:26.173 --> 00:30:29.176
And start the lottery.

351
00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:42.439
<i>Good evening. Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.</i>

352
00:30:43.649 --> 00:30:45.400
<i>It's been a busy week.</i>

353
00:30:45.609 --> 00:30:48.528
<i>We've had a record two winners
so far.</i>

354
00:30:48.737 --> 00:30:53.450
<i>Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation to The Island...</i>

355
00:30:53.617 --> 00:30:56.328
<i>... transported to the world's
last paradise.</i>

356
00:30:56.536 --> 00:30:59.831
<i>- And start the spin.
- And now let the spin begin.</i>

357
00:31:05.087 --> 00:31:07.130
<i>Jordan Two Delta.</i>

358
00:31:07.297 --> 00:31:10.092
<i>Step up, your time has come.</i>

359
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.136
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

360
00:31:18.558 --> 00:31:22.562
<i>For everyone else, never lose hope.</i>

361
00:31:25.273 --> 00:31:27.192
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:30.195
I can't believe it.

363
00:31:38.078 --> 00:31:40.330
I have to go in the morning.

364
00:31:40.497 --> 00:31:42.124
You were right.

365
00:31:44.042 --> 00:31:46.378
Good things do happen.

366
00:31:50.424 --> 00:31:52.592
I wish I'd known you better.

367
00:31:54.636 --> 00:31:57.722
You two. Watch your proximity.

368
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:08.692
I'll see you on The Island.

369
00:32:26.793 --> 00:32:30.130
You want to go to The Island.

370
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.469
Breathe!

371
00:32:38.096 --> 00:32:39.514
You've been chosen.

372
00:32:41.725 --> 00:32:44.811
<i>The Island awaits you.</i>

373
00:35:16.254 --> 00:35:18.798
She's so beautiful.

374
00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:21.718
I've never seen a baby.

375
00:35:22.385 --> 00:35:24.721
- Can I hold her?
- Not just yet.

376
00:35:31.895 --> 00:35:33.563
We're going to The Island?

377
00:36:51.724 --> 00:36:53.267
Oh, my God.

378
00:36:53.977 --> 00:36:56.437
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

379
00:36:56.604 --> 00:36:58.523
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

380
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.526
- My baby. Oh, my gosh.
- Whenever you're ready...

381
00:37:01.693 --> 00:37:05.321
...we have copies of your policy
termination for your records.

382
00:37:05.738 --> 00:37:08.157
Look at her. She's beautiful.

383
00:37:11.077 --> 00:37:14.247
Starkweather? That cute football player
on the Reebok commercials?

384
00:37:14.414 --> 00:37:17.125
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

385
00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:18.835
I just love him.

386
00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:22.046
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

387
00:37:22.255 --> 00:37:24.298
Any chance I can make this pickup?

388
00:37:24.465 --> 00:37:26.426
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

389
00:37:26.634 --> 00:37:30.805
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

390
00:37:31.013 --> 00:37:34.142
We don't fly in bad weather.

391
00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:40.440
They look real busy,
so I'd have a seat.

392
00:37:41.858 --> 00:37:43.985
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

393
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.323
Heart rate, 102. BP, 126/82.

394
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.784
- All right, laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

395
00:37:51.951 --> 00:37:54.579
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

396
00:37:54.746 --> 00:37:56.539
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

397
00:37:56.706 --> 00:37:58.791
Prepare that bone saw.

398
00:37:59.792 --> 00:38:02.211
I think we're about ready to open.

399
00:38:20.897 --> 00:38:22.732
Let's clean that drip.

400
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:28.613
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

401
00:38:30.865 --> 00:38:34.952
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

402
00:38:38.498 --> 00:38:41.250
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP, 138/92.

403
00:38:43.794 --> 00:38:46.464
- Heart rate's still rising.
- Boost the anesthetic level.

404
00:38:47.673 --> 00:38:49.175
He's fighting the ventilator.

405
00:38:49.342 --> 00:38:52.553
I don't wanna have to euthanize
this guy to get his liver.

406
00:39:03.022 --> 00:39:04.607
Oh, my God!

407
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.742
Stop that man! Get him!

408
00:39:21.958 --> 00:39:23.376
Stop!

409
00:39:40.184 --> 00:39:42.019
Relax. Relax, big guy.

410
00:39:42.228 --> 00:39:44.188
Easy, easy! Don't damage him!

411
00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:51.904
No! I don't wanna die! No!

412
00:39:52.113 --> 00:39:55.825
I want to go to The Island!
You promised!

413
00:39:56.158 --> 00:39:59.328
I wanna live! I don't wanna die!

414
00:40:00.413 --> 00:40:01.747
No!

415
00:40:03.541 --> 00:40:06.377
Hey. You okay, buddy?

416
00:40:06.794 --> 00:40:09.296
It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

417
00:40:09.463 --> 00:40:12.633
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

418
00:40:24.186 --> 00:40:25.354
Check this part out.

419
00:40:25.563 --> 00:40:27.481
Wait. Okay, watch. Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.775
Boom! Did you see that?

421
00:40:29.984 --> 00:40:34.155
Man. That is so cruel, man.

422
00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:37.408
Oh, man. Down for the count.

423
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.952
Gentlemen.

424
00:40:40.161 --> 00:40:42.496
I understand there's been an incident.

425
00:40:42.705 --> 00:40:45.082
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

426
00:40:45.249 --> 00:40:47.543
- And you find that funny?
- No, sir.

427
00:40:48.085 --> 00:40:50.713
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

428
00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:53.007
Play it back, please.

429
00:40:58.304 --> 00:40:59.847
Stop.

430
00:41:00.264 --> 00:41:01.932
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

431
00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:04.226
He was scared. I helped him up.

432
00:41:05.144 --> 00:41:06.520
Play it back at half-speed.

433
00:41:13.611 --> 00:41:15.529
Freeze.

434
00:41:16.322 --> 00:41:17.573
Magnify his wrist.

435
00:41:22.703 --> 00:41:24.330
We have a product on the loose.

436
00:41:25.748 --> 00:41:28.000
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

437
00:41:28.209 --> 00:41:30.711
- Let's go.
- Okay, down to Level Two.

438
00:42:11.919 --> 00:42:14.421
- How sweet. You came to...
- You gotta come with me.

439
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.715
Move! Move!

440
00:42:25.474 --> 00:42:28.227
We got a match! Lincoln Six Echo.

441
00:42:28.394 --> 00:42:32.106
I want a full contamination lockdown.
Find Six Echo.

442
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:35.985
Everybody, masks down.

443
00:42:36.193 --> 00:42:38.737
- What the hell?
- I need to see all your faces.

444
00:42:38.946 --> 00:42:41.532
I don't care what he says.
That's live human tissue.

445
00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:44.493
- Seal that liver now.
- Check the back corners.

446
00:42:48.914 --> 00:42:53.294
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

447
00:42:53.836 --> 00:42:55.170
Find out.

448
00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.842
What are you doing?
Men can't be in this...

449
00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:02.344
- You gotta trust me. I saw them.
- Who?

450
00:43:02.553 --> 00:43:04.638
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.
- What?

451
00:43:04.805 --> 00:43:06.390
They killed her and cut him open.

452
00:43:06.598 --> 00:43:08.434
Stop it! I wanna go back to my room.

453
00:43:08.642 --> 00:43:11.395
- You can't. They'll kill you.
- I'm going to The Island.

454
00:43:11.603 --> 00:43:13.731
- Jordan, there is no Island! Come on!
- No.

455
00:43:15.524 --> 00:43:18.110
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

456
00:43:18.277 --> 00:43:20.696
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

457
00:43:20.904 --> 00:43:23.198
Get out of the way! Watch out.

458
00:43:23.407 --> 00:43:25.075
Move! Move!

459
00:43:25.284 --> 00:43:27.244
Out of the way. Get out. Now.

460
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.163
Just trust me.

461
00:43:33.751 --> 00:43:35.919
<i>This is a community bulletin.</i>

462
00:43:36.336 --> 00:43:37.963
<i>Attention, residents.</i>

463
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.884
<i>A contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.</i>

464
00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:46.388
<i>Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.</i>

465
00:43:48.724 --> 00:43:51.018
Faster! Move!

466
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.690
Freeze! Stop right there!

467
00:43:59.526 --> 00:44:00.944
Get out of the way!

468
00:44:18.212 --> 00:44:20.005
- Go, go!
- Get out of the way!

469
00:44:29.097 --> 00:44:31.600
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

470
00:44:46.657 --> 00:44:48.534
There they are!

471
00:44:49.284 --> 00:44:51.662
I've got them
in the Sector Six basement!

472
00:44:51.828 --> 00:44:53.163
Get them!

473
00:45:04.716 --> 00:45:06.468
- No!
- Stop!

474
00:45:17.312 --> 00:45:18.939
Lincoln!

475
00:45:19.273 --> 00:45:21.608
No! Stop it!

476
00:45:24.444 --> 00:45:26.154
No!

477
00:46:03.734 --> 00:46:05.527
<i>You've been chosen.</i>

478
00:46:05.736 --> 00:46:08.655
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.
Chosen to survive.</i>

479
00:46:08.822 --> 00:46:12.075
<i>You are part of a new beginning.
You're special.</i>

480
00:46:12.242 --> 00:46:16.204
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

481
00:46:19.708 --> 00:46:23.587
<i>You want to go to The Island.</i>

482
00:46:23.795 --> 00:46:25.964
<i>You're a part of a new beginning.</i>

483
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:28.508
<i>You're special. You've been chosen.</i>

484
00:46:28.717 --> 00:46:31.344
<i>Very special. Chosen to survive.</i>

485
00:46:31.553 --> 00:46:35.974
<i>To carry on.
You want to go to The Island.</i>

486
00:46:40.062 --> 00:46:41.980
Go, go!

487
00:46:47.527 --> 00:46:49.696
<i>Very special.</i>

488
00:46:50.781 --> 00:46:52.574
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

489
00:46:52.783 --> 00:46:54.659
Check over here!

490
00:46:54.868 --> 00:46:57.037
Watch your left! Watch your left!

491
00:46:57.871 --> 00:46:59.414
Run.

492
00:47:03.043 --> 00:47:04.503
Run.

493
00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:06.588
He's over here.

494
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:12.594
<i>Very special.
You want to go to The Island.</i>

495
00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:15.138
There they are.

496
00:47:28.777 --> 00:47:31.029
- Lincoln!
- Come on!

497
00:47:31.196 --> 00:47:33.532
Get them! Let's go!

498
00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.701
- Move!
- Come on!

499
00:47:37.828 --> 00:47:39.663
Come on, come on. Damn!

500
00:47:40.455 --> 00:47:43.333
Go, go, go. Come on.

501
00:47:47.045 --> 00:47:49.339
You still think there's an Island?

502
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.560
Come on.

503
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.254
Come on. Come on.

504
00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:49.149
There's a door over here!

505
00:50:04.808 --> 00:50:09.604
<i>Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.</i>

506
00:50:09.771 --> 00:50:14.901
<i>Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on The Island.</i>

507
00:50:15.318 --> 00:50:18.363
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

508
00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:21.699
Sir, I want to focus.
I love my job. It's very interesting.

509
00:50:21.908 --> 00:50:24.911
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated...

510
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.456
...and it really worries me because
he's a very good friend of mine.

511
00:50:28.623 --> 00:50:30.542
And he's my only best friend.

512
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.961
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

513
00:50:33.128 --> 00:50:37.215
Sir, I have one question.
Where do all the tubes go?

514
00:50:39.884 --> 00:50:41.636
<i>The human organism.</i>

515
00:50:41.803 --> 00:50:44.681
<i>Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.</i>

516
00:50:44.848 --> 00:50:47.600
<i>The product of 3 billion years
of evolution.</i>

517
00:50:47.767 --> 00:50:51.145
<i>Prefect in every way except one.</i>

518
00:50:51.354 --> 00:50:54.858
<i>Like all machines, it wears out.</i>

519
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.194
<i>For centuries, the idea of replenishing
the human body...</i>

520
00:50:58.403 --> 00:51:00.446
<i>... has been at the forefront
of science.</i>

521
00:51:00.613 --> 00:51:03.283
I think we need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

522
00:51:03.449 --> 00:51:05.952
- How?
- By selling. Sell, sell, sell.

523
00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:07.662
You start, I finish.

524
00:51:18.047 --> 00:51:19.924
Ladies and gentlemen...

525
00:51:20.091 --> 00:51:23.803
...welcome to the next generation
of science:

526
00:51:24.012 --> 00:51:25.889
The agnate.

527
00:51:26.055 --> 00:51:30.143
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood...

528
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.894
...to match the client's age.

529
00:51:32.604 --> 00:51:36.107
You're looking at stage one
of its development.

530
00:51:36.274 --> 00:51:38.818
Within 12 months,
it will be harvest-ready...

531
00:51:38.985 --> 00:51:43.239
...providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin...

532
00:51:43.406 --> 00:51:46.784
...all genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

533
00:51:46.951 --> 00:51:51.664
And in compliance
with the eugenics laws of 2015...

534
00:51:51.831 --> 00:51:57.003
...all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

535
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.297
They never achieve consciousness.

536
00:51:59.505 --> 00:52:02.008
They never think...

537
00:52:02.175 --> 00:52:06.846
...or suffer or feel pain,
joy, love, hate.

538
00:52:07.013 --> 00:52:09.766
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen...

539
00:52:09.932 --> 00:52:11.726
...in every way that matters.

540
00:52:12.727 --> 00:52:15.355
<i>Not human.</i>

541
00:52:19.651 --> 00:52:22.904
This is our public-relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

542
00:52:23.071 --> 00:52:25.239
He'll be happy to answer
your questions.

543
00:52:25.406 --> 00:52:27.408
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

544
00:52:27.617 --> 00:52:31.537
I wanna talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

545
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.167
And I wanna tell you how you're gonna
live 60 to 70 years longer.

546
00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:43.925
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

547
00:52:44.092 --> 00:52:47.387
You come highly recommended by
the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

548
00:52:47.595 --> 00:52:50.306
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

549
00:52:50.473 --> 00:52:53.184
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

550
00:52:53.351 --> 00:52:56.062
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French special forces.

551
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.439
I understand you had
a corporate theft.

552
00:52:58.648 --> 00:53:01.025
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

553
00:53:01.192 --> 00:53:05.029
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

554
00:53:05.196 --> 00:53:08.199
We've had a security breach.

555
00:53:08.408 --> 00:53:11.953
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

556
00:53:12.161 --> 00:53:14.789
Because their investment here
is sizable.

557
00:53:14.956 --> 00:53:18.042
One hundred and twenty billion dollars,
to be exact.

558
00:53:18.209 --> 00:53:21.003
And I can't afford for them
to reconsider.

559
00:53:21.212 --> 00:53:23.297
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

560
00:53:23.464 --> 00:53:26.342
I am in the business of keeping
my clients' confidence.

561
00:53:27.093 --> 00:53:28.636
Good.

562
00:53:32.598 --> 00:53:35.184
Two of our products have escaped.

563
00:53:35.393 --> 00:53:37.895
Impressive, considering
they're vegetative.

564
00:53:38.062 --> 00:53:41.023
Well, after several years
of trial and error...

565
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.359
...we discovered that
without consciousness...

566
00:53:43.526 --> 00:53:45.528
...without human experience, emotion...

567
00:53:46.279 --> 00:53:48.114
...without life...

568
00:53:48.948 --> 00:53:50.992
...the organs failed.

569
00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:54.704
How long have they been missing?

570
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.623
Four hours and 36 minutes.

571
00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.501
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

572
00:54:00.668 --> 00:54:04.380
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five-mile perimeter.

573
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:06.632
Stand by for suspect description.

574
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:09.093
- We're on it.
- Follow me.

575
00:54:26.277 --> 00:54:29.530
- Come on. We gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

576
00:54:29.697 --> 00:54:31.198
- You gotta try. Come on.
- Where?

577
00:54:31.407 --> 00:54:33.576
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

578
00:54:33.743 --> 00:54:36.287
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

579
00:54:42.168 --> 00:54:44.337
What if we are contaminated?

580
00:54:45.129 --> 00:54:46.964
Then we'd be dead.

581
00:54:47.965 --> 00:54:51.469
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

582
00:55:01.854 --> 00:55:03.189
What is it?

583
00:55:03.356 --> 00:55:06.400
I don't know. But it's alive.

584
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.075
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

585
00:55:14.241 --> 00:55:15.576
Let's rest in here.

586
00:55:15.743 --> 00:55:19.538
Jordan Two Delta sponsor, Sarah Jordan,
is in a coma after a car accident.

587
00:55:19.705 --> 00:55:21.999
She's in need of multiple
organ transplants.

588
00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:23.292
How long does she have?

589
00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:25.836
Forty-eight hours.
Three days, maximum.

590
00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.630
Tell me about Six Echo.

591
00:55:27.838 --> 00:55:31.175
Well, he was really the first one
to question his environment...

592
00:55:31.342 --> 00:55:32.718
...his whole existence here.

593
00:55:33.844 --> 00:55:37.098
The last few months, he began
demonstrating unstable behavior...

594
00:55:37.264 --> 00:55:39.892
...and I can't account for it.

595
00:55:40.101 --> 00:55:42.395
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

596
00:55:42.561 --> 00:55:44.355
What do they know
about the outside world?

597
00:55:45.231 --> 00:55:46.941
Very little.

598
00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:50.152
We control them with the memory
of a shared event.

599
00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:51.821
A global contamination.

600
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:54.532
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

601
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.744
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope.

602
00:55:59.286 --> 00:56:01.414
Gives them purpose.

603
00:56:02.039 --> 00:56:04.208
Everything we expose them to...

604
00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:07.837
...their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play...

605
00:56:08.045 --> 00:56:11.507
...are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

606
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:14.135
<i>To avoid obvious complications...</i>

607
00:56:14.301 --> 00:56:16.929
<i>... they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.</i>

608
00:56:17.096 --> 00:56:20.224
<i>We find it simpler to eliminate
the drive altogether.</i>

609
00:56:20.975 --> 00:56:23.477
In a very real sense...

610
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.105
...they're like children.

611
00:56:26.272 --> 00:56:28.816
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

612
00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:49.253
- What was that?
- I don't know.

613
00:56:50.963 --> 00:56:52.965
But I want one.

614
00:57:07.313 --> 00:57:08.856
Look!

615
00:57:09.815 --> 00:57:13.068
Route 39. Route 39.

616
00:57:13.235 --> 00:57:14.862
Come on.

617
00:57:15.571 --> 00:57:17.865
I got it from a friend.

618
00:57:42.431 --> 00:57:44.391
I think that's it.

619
00:58:16.048 --> 00:58:17.383
What's up?

620
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:19.635
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

621
00:58:21.387 --> 00:58:23.472
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

622
00:58:24.556 --> 00:58:28.185
- I am.
- And you would be who?

623
00:58:28.435 --> 00:58:31.355
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

624
00:58:32.815 --> 00:58:34.441
Right.

625
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.403
Y'all some of those
desert UFO freaks?

626
00:58:37.611 --> 00:58:40.864
- U...? What? No. I don't think so, no.
- No.

627
00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:43.075
- McCord?
- Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.

628
00:58:43.242 --> 00:58:45.452
- He's in the can.
- He's in a can?

629
00:58:45.661 --> 00:58:47.371
Taking a dump.

630
00:58:47.579 --> 00:58:49.707
A dump? Taking it where?

631
00:58:51.458 --> 00:58:53.794
Tell you what,
you're fixing to get on my nerves.

632
00:58:53.961 --> 00:58:57.256
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

633
00:58:57.423 --> 00:59:00.134
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

634
00:59:00.342 --> 00:59:03.262
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

635
00:59:03.637 --> 00:59:05.305
Straight up?

636
00:59:16.984 --> 00:59:18.610
That is bitchen.

637
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:22.698
So this is Sector Five?

638
00:59:22.906 --> 00:59:25.033
Hey! You son of a bitch!

639
00:59:26.994 --> 00:59:28.704
You knew!

640
00:59:28.871 --> 00:59:32.291
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why? Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

641
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:35.085
- They'll be looking for you.
- Tell me what's going on!

642
00:59:35.294 --> 00:59:39.298
What's going on is if anybody sees us
together, both of us are gonna be dead.

643
00:59:39.715 --> 00:59:42.217
So will you just take your hands off me?
Let me...

644
00:59:43.051 --> 00:59:46.597
Let me pull my pants up.
I'll take you back to my place...

645
00:59:47.055 --> 00:59:48.432
...so we can be alone, okay?

646
00:59:51.727 --> 00:59:54.897
- Ed.
- Mac.

647
00:59:56.023 --> 00:59:58.233
Give you boys a minute?

648
01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:02.237
What? This isn't what it looks like.

649
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.617
Sure. Sure.

650
01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:11.246
Get out of here, you stupid...
Will you stop?

651
01:00:12.414 --> 01:00:15.667
You can't just bust in on a guy like that.
That's really rude.

652
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.463
She doesn't understand licking.

653
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.382
What are you, a knucklehead?
You brought another with you?

654
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:24.051
Excuse me. Listen, will you...?

655
01:00:24.218 --> 01:00:26.762
Hey, back off, Joe, okay?
Don't push me!

656
01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:29.681
No, that's no good.
Put it on my tab. We gotta go.

657
01:00:29.848 --> 01:00:31.850
Friends of mine.
They're from out of town.

658
01:00:32.017 --> 01:00:33.602
- Let's go.
- Give me your number.

659
01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:37.189
- Two Delta.
- Hey. Don't test me.

660
01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:38.941
Don't.

661
01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:53.330
Well, this is nice.

662
01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:59.419
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

663
01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.755
Do y'all work with him?

664
01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:06.176
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

665
01:01:06.343 --> 01:01:08.428
Some fancy tracksuits.

666
01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:13.141
Y'all exercise out in this heat, you'll get
yourself some nasty heat stroke.

667
01:01:13.308 --> 01:01:14.643
Oh, Mac.

668
01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:18.563
Look, they got matching bracelets.
We should do that, honey.

669
01:01:18.772 --> 01:01:20.148
Suzie.

670
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.027
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

671
01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:27.155
Yeah.

672
01:01:27.322 --> 01:01:29.950
Would you run down to Red's
and pick up a sixer of Bud?

673
01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:33.370
- We gotta talk shop.
- Okay, baby.

674
01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:34.913
Just making friends.

675
01:01:35.122 --> 01:01:37.040
- I know. Good. Just...
- Bye.

676
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.881
Why do they lie, Mac?

677
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.968
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

678
01:01:51.221 --> 01:01:53.265
To keep you from knowing
what you are.

679
01:01:54.307 --> 01:01:57.769
- What we are?
- What are we?

680
01:01:58.228 --> 01:02:01.815
Man, why do I gotta be the guy that
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

681
01:02:06.236 --> 01:02:08.613
Okay, look. You're...

682
01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:13.034
Well, you're not like me.

683
01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.998
I mean, you're not human.

684
01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:23.879
I mean, you're human, but you're just...
You're not real.

685
01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:26.006
You're not like a real person.

686
01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:28.008
Like me.

687
01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:32.971
You're clones.

688
01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:38.977
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

689
01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:41.021
- What?
- Clones?

690
01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:43.398
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

691
01:02:43.607 --> 01:02:46.359
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a face-lift...

692
01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:50.906
...or one of them gets sick and they
need a new part, they take it from you.

693
01:02:52.866 --> 01:02:55.911
But I have a mother. I remember her.

694
01:02:56.119 --> 01:02:58.163
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

695
01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:01.958
- I have a little dog and I had a bike.
- And a bike. Right.

696
01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:05.378
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars...

697
01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.672
...and you rode it
to your grandma's house.

698
01:03:07.881 --> 01:03:11.009
You ring a bell. She came out,
served you cookies on a hot plate.

699
01:03:11.384 --> 01:03:15.347
- Yeah.
- No. Memory imprints.

700
01:03:16.431 --> 01:03:20.185
I seen them. My buddy is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

701
01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:23.605
There's only, like, 12 stories.
They change around little details.

702
01:03:23.813 --> 01:03:25.899
But they're all pretty much the same.

703
01:03:26.107 --> 01:03:31.571
The life you think you had
before the "contamination"?

704
01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:33.615
It never happened.

705
01:03:35.283 --> 01:03:38.787
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

706
01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:43.041
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood? Be my guest.

707
01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:44.626
How long?

708
01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:47.379
How long have we been alive?

709
01:03:48.838 --> 01:03:51.508
You're Echo generation, so you're 3.

710
01:03:53.385 --> 01:03:54.719
Delta means you're 4.

711
01:03:57.514 --> 01:03:58.682
Three?

712
01:03:58.848 --> 01:04:02.727
The whole reason you exist is because
everyone wants to live forever.

713
01:04:02.894 --> 01:04:04.479
It's the new American dream.

714
01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:08.066
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

715
01:04:08.275 --> 01:04:11.486
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

716
01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:15.949
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sac.

717
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:20.829
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

718
01:04:20.996 --> 01:04:24.374
He doesn't want anyone knowing
the truth. Especially not your sponsors.

719
01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:28.294
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

720
01:04:28.461 --> 01:04:30.505
They, like, own you.

721
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:38.388
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

722
01:04:38.888 --> 01:04:43.018
Just because people eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

723
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.645
Besides...

724
01:04:45.812 --> 01:04:50.400
...do you know how many laws Merrick's
breaking to have you two hatched?

725
01:04:52.318 --> 01:04:54.320
Your sponsors can't have
any part of that.

726
01:04:54.487 --> 01:04:57.073
They're, like, high society.
Rich and famous.

727
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.451
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

728
01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:02.579
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the real truth.

729
01:05:02.787 --> 01:05:04.122
- What? No.
- Yeah.

730
01:05:04.289 --> 01:05:06.207
No. That's the worst idea
I ever heard.

731
01:05:06.374 --> 01:05:08.877
You know how dead I would be?
Not to mention fired?

732
01:05:09.085 --> 01:05:11.254
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

733
01:05:11.463 --> 01:05:13.923
Stop! Fold, stop. Brakes.
No. Come on.

734
01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.593
You're like the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

735
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.846
They're not gonna care.
They don't care. They're gonna care?

736
01:05:20.263 --> 01:05:22.348
You know what I would do
if I were you?

737
01:05:22.557 --> 01:05:26.019
I would get as far away from here
as I could. Go to the beach.

738
01:05:26.227 --> 01:05:29.314
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

739
01:05:29.606 --> 01:05:31.232
We're asking for your help.

740
01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:34.652
Oh, God.

741
01:05:42.952 --> 01:05:46.414
Infrared's having a hard time getting
a heat signature on our fugitives.

742
01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:48.416
Sand's too hot.

743
01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:54.297
He was implanted
with microsensors yesterday.

744
01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:58.301
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

745
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.679
- If we're within half a mile of the source.
- Do it.

746
01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:04.766
Your sponsors' names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

747
01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:06.768
Her sponsor lives in New York.

748
01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:09.521
The number in your name
is a regional code.

749
01:06:09.687 --> 01:06:13.733
Six Echo, it means
your sponsor lives in L.A.

750
01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:15.944
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state.

751
01:06:16.152 --> 01:06:17.904
Yeah. Put this on. No, no, no.

752
01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:20.823
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

753
01:06:21.032 --> 01:06:23.701
Keep going. What size?

754
01:06:25.995 --> 01:06:28.289
These are bags, okay?
You put stuff in them.

755
01:06:28.456 --> 01:06:31.167
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

756
01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:32.669
We're not idiots.

757
01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:35.964
Excuse me, Miss I'm-So-Smart-
l-Can't-Wait-to-Go-to-The-Island.

758
01:06:39.592 --> 01:06:40.677
Yeah. Good.

759
01:06:47.183 --> 01:06:50.561
Wait. Hold. People don't really wear
these on the outside.

760
01:06:50.728 --> 01:06:53.940
These are mail-order, okay?
They stay here.

761
01:06:56.567 --> 01:07:00.321
No. Mail-order, okay?
Clones don't wear these.

762
01:07:04.284 --> 01:07:05.618
All right. Listen up.

763
01:07:05.785 --> 01:07:08.496
This card is like stim credits.

764
01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:11.666
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours...

765
01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:16.170
...or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

766
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:23.261
All right, look. I know you're new to
this whole human experience and all...

767
01:07:23.428 --> 01:07:25.388
...but there's one universal truth...

768
01:07:25.596 --> 01:07:28.599
...and that is you never give a woman
your credit card.

769
01:07:28.766 --> 01:07:30.351
Right.

770
01:07:36.566 --> 01:07:38.109
I got something. It's hot.

771
01:07:53.624 --> 01:07:56.044
Train will be here in a few minutes.
Hustle up.

772
01:07:56.252 --> 01:07:59.672
<i>- And Sacramento is
now boarding at platform A.</i>

773
01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:02.216
All right, stay. All right? Just stay.

774
01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.052
Don't move.

775
01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:12.018
Look at that.

776
01:08:12.393 --> 01:08:14.187
Those are kids.

777
01:08:23.654 --> 01:08:26.949
Come here. The train is nonstop to L.A.
You need these to get on.

778
01:08:27.116 --> 01:08:30.787
When you arrive, look up your sponsors
in the information directory. Got it?

779
01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:34.332
Yeah. Yeah.
What is an information directory?

780
01:08:34.499 --> 01:08:36.292
It'll tell you where they live.

781
01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:39.212
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

782
01:08:39.378 --> 01:08:43.049
One thing I can tell you about people
is that they'll do anything to survive.

783
01:08:43.633 --> 01:08:45.134
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

784
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.095
Thanks a lot.

785
01:08:48.262 --> 01:08:51.557
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of L.A.

786
01:08:51.766 --> 01:08:53.976
Better not get me in trouble.

787
01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:18.042
I think I got an ID. Two in the center.

788
01:09:24.549 --> 01:09:26.551
Run!

789
01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:03.731
Run!

790
01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:07.568
Oh, God!

791
01:11:10.488 --> 01:11:15.326
<i>Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.</i>

792
01:11:20.623 --> 01:11:23.501
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

793
01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:40.810
- This was supposed to be simple.
- It's never simple.

794
01:11:40.976 --> 01:11:42.561
We got a missing credit card.

795
01:11:42.728 --> 01:11:45.564
McCord just used it
to buy train tickets.

796
01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:48.484
- It's not in his wallet.
- Monitor the account.

797
01:11:48.692 --> 01:11:51.904
Have Amtrak patch you through
to the train conductor.

798
01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:54.365
Get me a new team in L.A.

799
01:11:57.409 --> 01:11:59.870
Got here as fast as I could.

800
01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:03.415
I finished scanning the
Defense Department troop selections...

801
01:12:03.582 --> 01:12:06.085
...if you want to see them.
- Not yet. Look at that.

802
01:12:08.087 --> 01:12:10.965
- Six Echo drew it.
- Well, it's elaborate.

803
01:12:11.173 --> 01:12:13.634
<i>"Renovatio."</i>

804
01:12:13.843 --> 01:12:16.512
<i>"Renovatio"? Renovatio.</i>

805
01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.431
- What is that, Italian?
- It's Latin.

806
01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:22.560
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

807
01:12:22.768 --> 01:12:24.937
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

808
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.731
So where did he learn it?

809
01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:30.901
Where are the results
from his synaptic scan?

810
01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:32.987
They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...

811
01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:35.364
- Just speed it up.
- Yes, sir.

812
01:12:48.752 --> 01:12:50.087
You two.

813
01:12:55.301 --> 01:12:56.760
Over there!

814
01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:49.957
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

815
01:14:57.339 --> 01:15:00.676
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

816
01:15:00.843 --> 01:15:02.553
Thanks.

817
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.894
Wilshire. Fifth. Grand.

818
01:15:11.061 --> 01:15:14.189
Spring. Grand Avenue?

819
01:15:14.398 --> 01:15:15.858
Smile for the camera.

820
01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:27.452
Where is Flower? You on Flower?

821
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.496
Olive?

822
01:15:29.663 --> 01:15:31.290
Come on, come on.

823
01:15:31.456 --> 01:15:34.793
You look familiar. Gotcha.

824
01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:39.756
Three Black Wasps and two jet bikes.

825
01:15:39.965 --> 01:15:42.301
Hey! We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

826
01:15:48.265 --> 01:15:50.142
We're moving! Let's go.

827
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:06.617
We got a hit on McCord's credit card.
Location: Grand Avenue at 9830.

828
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:11.496
- Team, proceed immediately to 9830...
- No. L.A.P.D.'s moving in.

829
01:16:11.663 --> 01:16:13.582
They just flagged McCord's
credit card.

830
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:16.376
<i>- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.</i>

831
01:16:18.295 --> 01:16:19.796
<i>Not listed.</i>

832
01:16:20.005 --> 01:16:21.465
Sarah Jordan.

833
01:16:28.513 --> 01:16:32.517
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.</i>

834
01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:35.437
<i>She's sick.</i>

835
01:16:36.104 --> 01:16:39.816
<i>- Can I talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.</i>

836
01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:42.235
<i>Mommy, is that you?</i>

837
01:16:58.293 --> 01:17:00.462
Jordan, let's go.

838
01:17:03.048 --> 01:17:04.841
Freeze! Put your hands up!

839
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:07.302
- Get your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

840
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:09.346
Do as I say! Do as I say!

841
01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:12.974
- Lincoln!
- Just do what they say.

842
01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:14.518
Lincoln.

843
01:17:14.726 --> 01:17:16.478
Just pull back!

844
01:17:26.488 --> 01:17:28.573
Nail it! Quick! Move!

845
01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:42.087
We're detaining you for
the murder of James McCord.

846
01:17:42.254 --> 01:17:44.589
He was helping us!
He was my friend.

847
01:17:44.756 --> 01:17:47.134
Anything you say can be used
in a court of law.

848
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.468
What's a court of law?

849
01:17:52.222 --> 01:17:53.765
They'll run DNA.

850
01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:58.562
If the agnates are booked, it'll implicate
your clients in a murder investigation.

851
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.690
This is a nightmare.
You cannot allow this to happen.

852
01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:05.277
Do you understand me?
You use any force that is necessary.

853
01:18:05.485 --> 01:18:07.946
I'm ordering you to contain
the situation.

854
01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:11.241
One-Adam-82. We've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no ID.

855
01:18:11.783 --> 01:18:13.994
Notify Forensics.
We'll need DNA typing.

856
01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:16.496
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

857
01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:19.791
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

858
01:18:34.806 --> 01:18:37.642
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

859
01:18:49.404 --> 01:18:52.365
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

860
01:18:59.289 --> 01:19:00.999
Let's go!

861
01:19:03.627 --> 01:19:05.295
Go!

862
01:19:08.423 --> 01:19:09.966
We got cops. We got cops!

863
01:19:17.682 --> 01:19:18.934
Get down!

864
01:19:26.566 --> 01:19:28.401
Run!

865
01:19:29.235 --> 01:19:31.363
I see them! Let's get moving!

866
01:19:33.156 --> 01:19:35.700
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

867
01:19:36.826 --> 01:19:38.411
Move, move!

868
01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:39.954
Move out! Move out!

869
01:20:01.643 --> 01:20:03.853
Go, go, go!

870
01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:16.908
Shit! Check up here!

871
01:20:55.947 --> 01:20:59.325
Air Two, give me status
of the targets.

872
01:20:59.826 --> 01:21:02.871
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently take them out.

873
01:21:05.957 --> 01:21:07.667
Go!

874
01:21:09.919 --> 01:21:11.629
Move! Go, go!

875
01:21:11.838 --> 01:21:14.549
- I can't fit! I can't fit!
- Move it!

876
01:21:33.109 --> 01:21:34.944
Look out, look out, look out!

877
01:21:40.825 --> 01:21:42.243
Right, right, right!

878
01:21:57.008 --> 01:21:58.635
<i>Stay on them!</i>

879
01:22:00.303 --> 01:22:01.554
Look out!

880
01:22:06.267 --> 01:22:08.853
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

881
01:22:31.668 --> 01:22:33.378
Good job.

882
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:36.923
We gotta bail out.
Police choppers inbound.

883
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:48.726
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

884
01:22:59.654 --> 01:23:02.031
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

885
01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:08.329
Cops! Cops!

886
01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:32.645
He's coming back!

887
01:23:35.481 --> 01:23:37.316
Stay down, Jordan!

888
01:24:04.969 --> 01:24:07.763
- How do you know what you're doing?
- I don't know!

889
01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:08.574
Hold on!

890
01:25:10.785 --> 01:25:12.453
Look out!

891
01:25:21.754 --> 01:25:23.255
Look out!

892
01:25:28.052 --> 01:25:30.137
Hold on!

893
01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:50.992
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- I got you!

894
01:25:51.158 --> 01:25:53.160
- Don't let me go!
- I got you.

895
01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.332
- Don't drop me, Lincoln!
- I got you!

896
01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:00.501
- Don't drop me!
- I got you.

897
01:26:04.005 --> 01:26:05.965
Hold on, Lincoln! Pull me!

898
01:26:06.549 --> 01:26:08.008
Pull me!

899
01:26:08.968 --> 01:26:11.095
Climb up!

900
01:26:14.098 --> 01:26:19.103
If there's no way to get our fugitives
quietly, you need to take them out.

901
01:26:22.356 --> 01:26:26.944
I see our targets about 70 stories up.
They're on top of the building logo.

902
01:26:30.614 --> 01:26:32.116
Tough day.

903
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:34.201
Let's roll.

904
01:26:35.911 --> 01:26:38.080
L.A.P.D.! Get away from the window!

905
01:26:42.668 --> 01:26:44.253
Jay, you got them?

906
01:26:45.421 --> 01:26:47.506
Right there, right there! Get them!

907
01:26:55.848 --> 01:26:58.767
Stay there! Damn it! Stay down!

908
01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:01.020
Come on!

909
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:06.734
I'm gonna swing around to get a shot.

910
01:27:13.407 --> 01:27:14.617
He's coming back.

911
01:27:30.799 --> 01:27:31.884
Oh, no.

912
01:27:35.763 --> 01:27:38.224
Hang on. It's coming off the building.

913
01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:23.602
Jesus must love you!

914
01:28:23.769 --> 01:28:26.772
That was the craziest mess I ever seen!
Come on, girl.

915
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:29.525
I know Jesus loves you.

916
01:28:39.702 --> 01:28:42.204
Can you keep a secret, doc?

917
01:28:42.371 --> 01:28:43.914
Why, yes, of course.

918
01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:46.333
There is something going on
around here.

919
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.753
- Something you may not even know.
- What is it?

920
01:28:49.962 --> 01:28:55.009
Well, I'm not sure
that the contamination is real.

921
01:28:55.217 --> 01:28:57.136
- Why do you think that?
- Okay.

922
01:28:57.302 --> 01:29:03.058
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

923
01:29:03.225 --> 01:29:06.770
Right. And I think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

924
01:29:06.937 --> 01:29:09.440
Have you told anyone else about this?

925
01:29:09.648 --> 01:29:13.444
No. But I'm gonna do some digging.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

926
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:16.196
And when I do,
I'll share my information with you.

927
01:29:16.363 --> 01:29:17.990
Thank you.

928
01:29:18.282 --> 01:29:19.742
I wanna be helpful.

929
01:29:19.908 --> 01:29:22.202
- I like it here.
- Good.

930
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:24.955
But I really wanna look
into the lottery too.

931
01:29:25.122 --> 01:29:27.875
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

932
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:29.877
You know...

933
01:29:30.043 --> 01:29:32.880
...you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

934
01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:34.673
You're very smart.

935
01:29:35.174 --> 01:29:37.468
- Yeah.
- I remember when I first came here.

936
01:29:40.387 --> 01:29:42.765
A survivor, just like you.

937
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:45.559
One of the first, in fact.

938
01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:48.437
It's natural, even healthy,
to question the world.

939
01:29:49.146 --> 01:29:53.066
Well, you might say it's only...
Only human.

940
01:29:55.819 --> 01:29:57.780
That burns!

941
01:30:00.157 --> 01:30:03.577
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

942
01:30:21.386 --> 01:30:23.764
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

943
01:30:24.306 --> 01:30:26.767
We'll go there when the rain stops.

944
01:30:27.476 --> 01:30:30.646
- It'll be okay when we find him.
- Okay.

945
01:30:36.193 --> 01:30:39.029
That little boy looked like me.

946
01:30:42.282 --> 01:30:44.493
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

947
01:30:45.869 --> 01:30:47.579
I don't know.

948
01:30:50.541 --> 01:30:51.833
You're lying.

949
01:30:59.758 --> 01:31:01.677
It's cold.

950
01:31:51.977 --> 01:31:54.730
- Go in.
- I can't.

951
01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.190
- I'll go in.
- Jordan.

952
01:31:57.691 --> 01:31:59.234
Jordan!

953
01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:04.531
Hello?

954
01:32:07.617 --> 01:32:09.327
Hello?

955
01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:58.794
Lincoln!

956
01:33:15.727 --> 01:33:17.938
Oh, my God.

957
01:33:20.315 --> 01:33:23.026
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

958
01:33:23.193 --> 01:33:25.779
I'm your insurance policy.

959
01:33:40.377 --> 01:33:43.880
And what are you doing in my house?

960
01:33:48.552 --> 01:33:50.262
Sir. Sir.

961
01:33:51.179 --> 01:33:52.722
You need to see this.

962
01:33:52.889 --> 01:33:54.933
It's... It's...

963
01:33:55.976 --> 01:33:57.102
It's beautiful.

964
01:33:57.519 --> 01:33:59.771
This is the scan of Six Echo
three years ago...

965
01:33:59.938 --> 01:34:02.607
...before we integrated him
into the agnate population.

966
01:34:02.774 --> 01:34:05.151
This is his synaptic scan
from a few days ago.

967
01:34:05.318 --> 01:34:07.028
See how much
the memory's grown.

968
01:34:07.237 --> 01:34:10.532
It's like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

969
01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:14.619
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

970
01:34:14.786 --> 01:34:18.873
An infection can't teach you Latin.
Nor how to fly.

971
01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.591
They are memories.

972
01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:31.761
But they're not his.

973
01:34:33.763 --> 01:34:36.224
They belong to his sponsor.

974
01:34:36.641 --> 01:34:38.268
I've seen you before.

975
01:34:39.644 --> 01:34:42.522
<i>- I've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...
- Maxim?</i>

976
01:34:43.481 --> 01:34:45.734
They're men's magazines.

977
01:34:46.151 --> 01:34:50.822
Pictures of women with little,
tight, short...

978
01:34:51.239 --> 01:34:52.490
Stories too.

979
01:34:52.657 --> 01:34:55.243
Anyway, you are very popular.

980
01:34:57.912 --> 01:34:59.539
There we are.

981
01:35:01.124 --> 01:35:04.586
- What is that?
- Looks like some kind of thermal im...

982
01:35:07.547 --> 01:35:09.215
Boy, your skin is so soft.

983
01:35:10.633 --> 01:35:12.344
Did you know?

984
01:35:17.349 --> 01:35:21.019
- I put some clothes out for you upstairs.
- Thank you.

985
01:35:21.186 --> 01:35:24.064
No, thank you.

986
01:35:33.615 --> 01:35:35.742
I keep expecting to wake up.

987
01:35:36.159 --> 01:35:37.952
I thought I was taller.

988
01:35:38.828 --> 01:35:42.248
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

989
01:35:43.333 --> 01:35:45.877
She is unbelievable.

990
01:35:46.044 --> 01:35:48.046
How is it you've been around
three years...

991
01:35:48.213 --> 01:35:51.132
...and get the kind of woman
I haven't found my whole life?

992
01:35:51.299 --> 01:35:52.592
Give me that.

993
01:35:52.759 --> 01:35:56.137
She found me. She's my best friend.

994
01:35:56.513 --> 01:35:59.682
- Why do we sound different?
- I'm from Scotland.

995
01:35:59.849 --> 01:36:01.935
"I'm from Scotland."

996
01:36:02.102 --> 01:36:04.771
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

997
01:36:04.938 --> 01:36:06.356
"Without that."

998
01:36:06.523 --> 01:36:10.068
No, really, cut it out. That's enough.

999
01:36:10.318 --> 01:36:12.987
Yeah, that is enough. I'm sorry.

1000
01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:15.615
Like a freak show.

1001
01:36:15.782 --> 01:36:17.742
Yeah, it's weird.

1002
01:36:20.537 --> 01:36:22.080
So you build boats?

1003
01:36:22.247 --> 01:36:26.084
Yeah. Well, I design them.
I draw them. Yeah, yeah.

1004
01:36:26.251 --> 01:36:27.585
Here.

1005
01:36:27.794 --> 01:36:31.172
I started off with cars, motorcycles,
experimental designs.

1006
01:36:32.632 --> 01:36:34.509
Anything that blew my hair back.

1007
01:36:34.717 --> 01:36:36.678
Kind of a speed freak.
Petrol-head.

1008
01:36:36.845 --> 01:36:40.265
Motorcycles. It's weird.
I feel like I've seen these before.

1009
01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:42.392
Yeah, it's something I've always done.

1010
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.769
I never dreamt it would make me rich.

1011
01:36:44.978 --> 01:36:49.274
<i>- What's "renovatio"?
- Renovatio in Latin means "rebirth."</i>

1012
01:36:49.774 --> 01:36:51.651
Subtle, eh?

1013
01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:55.780
Look. I have cirrhotic hepatitis...

1014
01:36:55.947 --> 01:36:58.783
...a parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

1015
01:36:59.576 --> 01:37:01.035
What?

1016
01:37:01.411 --> 01:37:03.830
Lots and lots of sex.

1017
01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:08.209
- Sex?
- Sex with...

1018
01:37:09.043 --> 01:37:10.878
You've ne... You're a virgin?

1019
01:37:12.589 --> 01:37:15.008
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

1020
01:37:17.844 --> 01:37:20.513
Okay, I'm not gonna spoil the surprise.

1021
01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.432
Boy, are you in for a treat.

1022
01:37:22.599 --> 01:37:26.519
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

1023
01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:34.569
I'm not good at all this shite, you know?
Confessions and regrets.

1024
01:37:38.531 --> 01:37:43.578
Look. There are people who are
following us, trying to kill us.

1025
01:37:43.745 --> 01:37:45.830
The reason we came is
we need your help.

1026
01:37:46.039 --> 01:37:49.375
- Help you do what?
- To show people what the institute does.

1027

and I don't believe it.

Who is that guy? I know him.
Is he the community announcer?

1029
01:37:57.717 --> 01:37:59.218
He's the President of America.

1030
01:37:59.677 --> 01:38:02.180
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

1031
01:38:02.347 --> 01:38:03.931
Yeah, I never liked him either.

1032
01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.768
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

1033
01:38:07.352 --> 01:38:11.147
If we can get on there together, people
will see, and they'll know the truth.

1034
01:38:11.314 --> 01:38:16.402
So we both just waltz down to NBC
and see if they can slot us in?

1035
01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:21.115
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

1036
01:38:21.282 --> 01:38:24.702
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

1037
01:38:31.209 --> 01:38:32.752
Help us.

1038
01:38:35.630 --> 01:38:38.674
All right. Let me just get
my shoes, okay?

Yeah. She's gonna stay here

- Yeah, I taught myself.

you'd do the same thing if you were me.

1074
01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:28.886
Five million dollars.

1075
01:41:29.303 --> 01:41:32.306
- Is that a lot?
- It's a small price to pay to cheat death.

1076

That's a red.

1077

1080
01:42:00.418 --> 01:42:03.129

It means stop!

Close.

1112
01:45:42.639 --> 01:45:46.768
Do you think it's strange that
my insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1113
01:45:46.935 --> 01:45:49.980
I find this whole operation strange.

1114

Where's the woman?

1115
01:45:52.357 --> 01:45:55.569
She said she was going out of state...

1116
01:45:55.986 --> 01:45:57.946
...to look for her sponsor.

1117
01:45:58.113 --> 01:46:01.950
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1118
01:46:02.117 --> 01:46:07.164
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

1119
01:46:07.331 --> 01:46:09.625
That kind of secret?

1120
01:46:10.459 --> 01:46:13.253
Have you talked with
anyone else about this?

1121
01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.922
Who would believe it?

1122
01:46:15.255 --> 01:46:17.007
Can I count on that?

1123
01:46:17.216 --> 01:46:19.593
The only thing you can count on...

1124
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.096
...is that people will do
anything to survive.

1125
01:46:23.513 --> 01:46:27.976
I just want to live. I don't care how.

1126

- I know. Open your mouth again.

1133
01:47:48.765 --> 01:47:51.810
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

1134
01:48:15.125 --> 01:48:17.502
The Island is real.

1135
01:48:18.837 --> 01:48:20.172
It's us.

1136
01:48:23.425 --> 01:48:26.261
- How many are affected?
- About half.

1137
01:48:26.428 --> 01:48:29.264
We're seeing the same neural patterns
in all the Echos...

1138
01:48:29.431 --> 01:48:33.435
...plus every subsequent generation:
The Foxtrots, Gammas and Hilos.

1139
01:48:33.602 --> 01:48:37.230
We predicated our entire system
on predictability.

1140
01:48:37.397 --> 01:48:41.693
Six Echo has displayed the one trait
that undermines it:

1141
01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.446
Human curiosity.

1142
01:48:45.489 --> 01:48:50.619
So we're now facing
four generations...

1143
01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:53.955
...with the potential
for defiant behavior.

1144
01:48:55.165 --> 01:48:56.958
What are you suggesting?

1145
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:59.628
A recall.

1146
01:49:00.212 --> 01:49:04.466
Wait. You mean dispose of over
$200 million worth of product?

1147
01:49:04.633 --> 01:49:07.302

<i>... they'd see the truth.</i>

1192
01:52:20.495 --> 01:52:26.542
Gentlemen, there is, however, another
matter that requires board approval.

1193
01:52:28.503 --> 01:52:31.673
<i>The disposal of $200 million
of infected product.</i>

1194
01:52:38.888 --> 01:52:40.348
All in favor?

1195
01:52:40.556 --> 01:52:41.849
<i>- Aye.
- Aye.</i>

1196
01:52:57.031 --> 01:52:58.241
<i>You've been chosen.</i>

1197
01:52:59.367 --> 01:53:00.576
<i>You're special.</i>

1198
01:53:03.329 --> 01:53:05.290
<i>Very special.</i>

1199
01:53:10.962 --> 01:53:13.131
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1200
01:53:19.595 --> 01:53:22.265
- There you go.
- And what do you say to the nice lady?

1201
01:53:22.473 --> 01:53:24.183
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1202
01:54:06.976 --> 01:54:09.395
No. No.

1203
01:54:31.793 --> 01:54:33.711
Inbound, Jordan product.

1204
01:54:48.809 --> 01:54:52.480
- Escort her to Surgery Prep 7.
- I'd better say hello.

1205
01:55:01.197 --> 01:55:04.367
Mr. Lincoln, thank you for coming.
It's great seeing you again.

1206
01:55:04.534 --> 01:55:07.995
And we are so, so sorry
about this entire episode.

1207
01:55:08.162 --> 01:55:11.916
I wanna tell you we'll be birthing
a brand-new agnate for you...

1208
01:55:12.083 --> 01:55:14.460
...free of charge.
Won't cost you a penny.

1209
01:55:14.627 --> 01:55:19.006
After you. Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack or...?

1210
01:55:19.173 --> 01:55:20.925
No. How long will this take?

1211
01:55:21.092 --> 01:55:24.220
It's gonna take about an hour.
I read that you're from Scotland.

1212
01:55:24.387 --> 01:55:27.223
I prefer Ireland myself.
But what part exactly in Scotland?

1213
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:31.394
Mr Whitman, I realize small talk is just 
part of your job, but let's cut the shite, okay?

1214
01:55:31.561 --> 01:55:34.897
Point taken. My apologies.
I'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.

1215
01:55:35.064 --> 01:55:37.942
Chatty Cathy. Turn right. This way.

1216
01:55:44.991 --> 01:55:46.784
I'll take her.

1217
01:55:58.587 --> 01:56:01.173
This is gonna be the exact same routine
as last time.

1218
01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:03.551
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here shortly.

1219
01:56:03.718 --> 01:56:05.594
Look at you, so young and successful.

1220
01:56:05.761 --> 01:56:08.264
I always wanted to
get into yachting myself. I...

1221
01:56:20.151 --> 01:56:22.111
I hear they're taking your kidneys...

1222
01:56:23.279 --> 01:56:26.615
...your lungs, your heart.

1223
01:56:27.283 --> 01:56:30.619
They are gonna hack you up.

1224
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.626
Too bad.

1225
01:56:52.641 --> 01:56:54.310
No one is touching me.

1226
01:56:56.479 --> 01:56:58.064
Give me your Tri-key.

1227
01:56:58.230 --> 01:56:59.648
- You shot me.
- Shut up!

1228
01:56:59.857 --> 01:57:01.734
Give me your walkie!

1229
01:57:04.862 --> 01:57:06.781
Get down. Get down, now!

1230
01:57:50.574 --> 01:57:52.326
You all right?

1231
01:57:54.495 --> 01:57:56.121
Come on.

1232
01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:00.751
I've got this figured out. I kind of...

1233
01:58:00.918 --> 01:58:04.797
I messed up in one area right down there,
but on the whole it doesn't matter.

1234
01:58:05.297 --> 01:58:07.883
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

1235
01:58:08.676 --> 01:58:10.010
Hello, sir.

1236
01:58:10.177 --> 01:58:12.137
Thank you for your patience.

1237
01:58:12.304 --> 01:58:14.431
I'm sure you're excited
to get to The Island.

1238
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.309
If you can grab your
personal belongings, line up...

1239
01:58:17.476 --> 01:58:20.479
...and follow me, we'll be on our way.

1240
01:58:21.689 --> 01:58:24.024
Take this. Go.

1241
01:58:24.358 --> 01:58:27.486
You have to keep going. Go. Go.

1242
01:58:27.653 --> 01:58:30.155
- Okay.
- Go shut it down.

1243
01:58:43.961 --> 01:58:45.671
I love that Picasso.

1244
01:58:46.672 --> 01:58:49.383
Do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?

1245
01:58:50.884 --> 01:58:54.805
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. I'm very pleased. Thank you.

1246
01:58:55.014 --> 01:58:58.434
- What about the client? Sarah Jordan?
- She's doubtful.

1247
01:58:58.642 --> 01:59:00.519
Even if the transplants
are a success...

1248
01:59:00.686 --> 01:59:03.814
...her brain damage may be
too severe for any real recovery.

1249
01:59:03.981 --> 01:59:05.774
You took too long bringing her back.

1250
01:59:05.941 --> 01:59:09.611
So the girl I brought in, you're going
to harvest her, kill her anyway...

1251
01:59:09.778 --> 01:59:12.072
...even though it
won't make any difference?

1252
01:59:12.239 --> 01:59:15.075
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

1253
01:59:16.243 --> 01:59:18.871
Now, do excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

1254
01:59:21.915 --> 01:59:25.627
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe rebellion?

1255
01:59:25.961 --> 01:59:29.798
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded...

1256
01:59:32.217 --> 01:59:35.637
...so others would know
we were less than human.

1257
01:59:36.764 --> 01:59:38.891
I've seen and done things
I'm not proud of...

1258
01:59:39.058 --> 01:59:43.812
...but at some point you realize
war is a business.

1259
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:51.403
So when did killing
become a business for you?

1260
01:59:57.618 --> 02:00:00.788
Oh, it's so much more than that.

1261
02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:07.044
I have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

1262
02:00:07.252 --> 02:00:08.712
I give life.

1263
02:00:09.379 --> 02:00:11.048
The agnates.

1264
02:00:11.215 --> 02:00:15.135
They're simply tools, instruments.
They have no souls.

1265
02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:18.931
The possibilities are endless here.

1266
02:00:19.098 --> 02:00:22.935
In two years' time, I will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

1267
02:00:23.102 --> 02:00:26.313
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

1268
02:00:28.107 --> 02:00:29.942
I guess just you and God.

1269
02:00:33.904 --> 02:00:36.698
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

1270
02:00:41.954 --> 02:00:44.414
Mr. Whitman has
your check downstairs.

1271
02:00:51.547 --> 02:00:54.758
Looks like single gunshot.

1272
02:00:57.052 --> 02:00:58.387
Oh, no.

1273
02:00:59.721 --> 02:01:01.056
Wrong wrist.

1274
02:01:01.557 --> 02:01:05.477
<i>Dr. Merrick,
the body that just came in...</i>

1275
02:01:05.644 --> 02:01:06.937
<i>... it's the client.</i>

1276
02:01:20.284 --> 02:01:22.744
Issue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

1277
02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:30.502
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

1278
02:01:43.890 --> 02:01:45.892
There's a disturbance
in the Hologram Room.

1279
02:01:46.059 --> 02:01:47.394
I'm on it.

1280
02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:51.982
I've sent censors to check
a possible attempted breach...

1281
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:53.984
<i>... in Hologram Control.</i>

1282
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:37.194
One after another, step into the room.

1283
02:02:37.361 --> 02:02:39.988
If I'm going to The Island,
why did I leave my bag?

1284
02:02:40.155 --> 02:02:41.782
Step right in, thank you.

1285
02:02:42.824 --> 02:02:44.910
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1286
02:02:45.077 --> 02:02:46.661
Is this the right way?

1287
02:02:46.828 --> 02:02:49.498
Are you new here?
I don't know if this is the way!

1288
02:02:49.664 --> 02:02:51.500
It's going to The Island?

1289
02:02:53.835 --> 02:02:56.463
I'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

1290
02:03:01.259 --> 02:03:02.761
Open the door!

1291
02:03:08.975 --> 02:03:11.311
She said, open the door.

1292
02:03:46.513 --> 02:03:51.268
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

1293
02:03:51.476 --> 02:03:54.104
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

1294
02:03:55.021 --> 02:03:57.107
My name is Lincoln!

1295
02:05:16.144 --> 02:05:17.854
I brought you into this world...

1296
02:05:24.402 --> 02:05:26.071
...and I can take you out of it.
