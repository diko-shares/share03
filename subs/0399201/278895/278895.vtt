1
00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.264
You're special.

2
00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:52.984
You have a very special
purpose in life.

3
00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:56.584
You've been chosen.

4
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.942
The Island awaits you.

5
00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:00.734
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.530
Good morning, Tower One.

7
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.047
Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.

8
00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:34.528
Sunny and mild.

9
00:03:45.206 --> 00:03:47.126
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

10
00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:53.286
And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.

11
00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:06.083
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12
00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:16.842
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

13
00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:29.521
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

14
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.239
Thank you.

15
00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:35.079
We're full.

16
00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:41.638
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

17
00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:43.878
Another day in paradise.

18
00:04:57.195 --> 00:04:59.355
Starkweather Two Delta,

19
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.714
your time has come.

20
00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:03.634
You're moving out to the Island.

21
00:05:03.714 --> 00:05:05.593
Starkweather Two Delta here.

22
00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:08.913
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

23
00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:11.593
I've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

24
00:05:11.673 --> 00:05:13.353
but I won the lottery.

25
00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.951
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

26
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.312
To go out and breathe fresh air,
swim in the ocean...

27
00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:24.391
I can't believe I won.
You call me Mr. Popular, I know.

28
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.030
It's me. It's me.

29
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.550
You guys know I'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.

30
00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.949
I'm going to the Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!

31
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.788
But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! I won!

32
00:05:38.868 --> 00:05:40.108
That was this week's...

33
00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:42.628
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

34
00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:46.267
...just moments before his
final departure to the Island,

35
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:49.267
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

36
00:05:49.347 --> 00:05:51.506
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

37
00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:54.506
The next lottery is tonight.

38
00:05:55.826 --> 00:05:59.345
The next lottery is tonight.

39
00:06:01.506 --> 00:06:04.265
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

40
00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:07.744
- What about you?
- Three.

41
00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:09.703
Three. I've been here seven.

42
00:06:09.783 --> 00:06:13.904
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

43
00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:17.981
I'm such a loser.

44
00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.777
Sir.

45
00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:50.736
Yeah, you.

46
00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:54.177
Swipe.

47
00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:58.976
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

48
00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:01.935
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

49
00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:04.496
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

50
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:08.454
- I'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

51
00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:11.254
Thank you, you too.
You both have a pleasant day too.

52
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:34.691
Feel the stretch.

53
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.530
One more breath in.

54
00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.087
But I was in that section.

55
00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:56.688
No, I don't understand!

56
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:59.286
- I tried! I tried to do the best I...
- Listen to me!

57
00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:05.005
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

58
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:08.764
A healthy person is a happy person.

59
00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:18.963
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

60
00:08:19.003 --> 00:08:20.442
No bacon today?

61
00:08:20.522 --> 00:08:22.644
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

62
00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:25.122
In that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

63
00:08:25.202 --> 00:08:26.561
and a side of sausages.

64
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.362
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

65
00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:33.681
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

66
00:08:33.761 --> 00:08:35.601
Now, what's it gonna be?

67
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.680
Move it.

68
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:40.681
Surprise me.

69
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.158
Surprise.

70
00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:51.278
Yummy. Next.

71
00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:05.236
Watch and learn.

72
00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:07.755
Next.

73
00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:10.195
Jordan Two Delta.

74
00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:11.755
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

75
00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:15.194
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

76
00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:18.034
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

77
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:22.314
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

78
00:09:22.993 --> 00:09:25.912
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

79
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:28.113
Get you anything else?

80
00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:30.313
Maybe a little bacon.

81
00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.871
No, it says I shouldn't.

82
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.511
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

83
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.430
Thank you.

84
00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:43.030
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

85
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.230
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

86
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.869
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

87
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:51.508
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? I love this stuff.

88
00:09:51.588 --> 00:09:54.228
Better eat up.
You'll need all your strength tonight.

89
00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:55.469
Is that a challenge?

90
00:09:55.508 --> 00:09:58.028
I promise I'll go easy on you.

91
00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:03.627
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

92
00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.547
Yeah.

93
00:10:06.387 --> 00:10:10.985
"'Who wants Sally? ' said Dick.
'I do,' said Jane.

94
00:10:11.065 --> 00:10:13.745
'I cannot find Sally.

95
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:18.344
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

96
00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.865
Is Sally here?"'

97
00:10:32.623 --> 00:10:35.261
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

98
00:10:39.501 --> 00:10:42.221
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

99
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.661
Sir?

100
00:10:47.741 --> 00:10:52.338
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

101
00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:02.497
Please, sit down.

102
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.858
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

103
00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:08.376
Not so good, I guess.

104
00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:10.336
Why do you say that?

105
00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:13.097
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

106
00:11:13.217 --> 00:11:16.056
That's a rather negative association.

107
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:20.414
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

108
00:11:20.454 --> 00:11:21.975
Right.

109
00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:28.014
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

110
00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:29.332
with Jordan Two Delta.

111
00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:33.173
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

112
00:11:33.213 --> 00:11:37.452
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

113
00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:39.413
I know the rules of proximity.

114
00:11:41.651 --> 00:11:44.211
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

115
00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:47.170
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

116
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.651
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

117
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:54.689
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

118
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.449
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

119
00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.008
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

120
00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:04.888
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to the Island.

121
00:12:04.968 --> 00:12:08.087
A boat? What kind of boat?

122
00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:10.846
A nice boat.

123
00:12:10.926 --> 00:12:12.406
Draw it for me, would you?

124
00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:21.005
So, you are heading
toward the Island.

125
00:12:21.045 --> 00:12:22.965
What happens then?

126
00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.804
- I drown.
- Really?

127
00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:29.644
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know. You tell me.

128
00:12:29.724 --> 00:12:32.644
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would I be afraid?

129
00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:34.483
You tell me.

130
00:12:39.043 --> 00:12:41.322
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

131
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.202
Well, it's...

132
00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:47.360
It's just...

133
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.321
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

134
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:53.559
And I'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

135
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:56.121
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

136
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.279
And why can't I have bacon?
I line up every morning,

137
00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:02.159
and I'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

138
00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:04.277
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

139
00:13:04.357 --> 00:13:06.478
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

140
00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:10.037
It's impossible to keep clean.
I always get the gray stripe.

141
00:13:10.117 --> 00:13:12.717
I never get any color.
And I hand it in to be cleaned,

142
00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:16.676
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

143
00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:19.475
Who is that person? I don't know.

144
00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:21.196
I just... I wanna know answers.

145
00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:23.916
And I wish that there was more.

146
00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:26.875
- More?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:31.073
More than just waiting
to go to the Island.

148
00:13:33.754 --> 00:13:35.994
Lincoln,

149
00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:38.793
it's your nature
to question things.

150
00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:43.511
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

151
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:47.592
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

152
00:13:47.672 --> 00:13:50.791
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

153
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.270
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to the Island too?

154
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.709
No.

155
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:03.869
My responsibility is to make sure

156
00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.149
this facility continues to operate.

157
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:11.588
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

158
00:14:11.668 --> 00:14:14.228
...we can't win the lottery.

159
00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:18.906
Let me see that.

160
00:14:20.906 --> 00:14:22.666
You draw well.

161
00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:25.586
"Renovatio. "
What does that mean?

162
00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:27.825
I don't know.
It's always in my dream.

163
00:14:30.065 --> 00:14:32.424
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

164
00:14:33.224 --> 00:14:34.584
What sort of tests?

165
00:14:35.424 --> 00:14:37.863
Nice tests.

166
00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:39.223
Come with me.

167
00:14:46.022 --> 00:14:47.742
Take a seat.

168
00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:54.541
OK, let's get you comfortable.

169
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.020
Swing back.

170
00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:03.899
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

171
00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:06.060
Totally harmless.

172
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.979
Don't worry, it's painless.

173
00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:30.535
- It hurts.
- Not really.

174
00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:32.256
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

175
00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:34.574
Yeah, it really, really does!

176
00:15:39.492 --> 00:15:42.574
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

177
00:15:42.614 --> 00:15:45.812
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

178
00:15:45.892 --> 00:15:48.492
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

179
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:50.572
Now, that might hurt.

180
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.090
Six Echo, you're late.

181
00:16:17.328 --> 00:16:19.207
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

182
00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:20.487
- Doing what?
- This.

183
00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:23.408
- I never really thought about it.
- I think about it a lot.

184
00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:25.367
- About what?
- This boring job.

185
00:16:25.447 --> 00:16:28.486
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

186
00:16:28.526 --> 00:16:32.006
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? It's good for us.

187
00:16:32.126 --> 00:16:34.646
You don't ever wonder about anything?

188
00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:37.125
Where do these tubes go?

189
00:16:38.285 --> 00:16:39.684
They start there.

190
00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:42.564
And they go... right there.

191
00:16:43.764 --> 00:16:46.522
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

192
00:16:46.602 --> 00:16:48.563
Seven Foxtrot.

193
00:16:48.643 --> 00:16:52.242
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

194
00:16:52.322 --> 00:16:53.922
He'll probably win the lottery.

195
00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:57.120
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

196
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.362
Straight down in the hole.

197
00:17:00.402 --> 00:17:04.080
In the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

198
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.441
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

199
00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:11.839
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

200
00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:14.759
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

201
00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:15.839
Right.

202
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:18.158
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

203
00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:19.998
Rigged?

204
00:17:21.397 --> 00:17:23.397
I've been working on this. Here.

205
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:25.397
Take a look at that.

206
00:17:26.038 --> 00:17:28.957
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the Island.

207
00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:32.196
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

208
00:17:32.236 --> 00:17:35.076
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

209
00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:38.115
I assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

210
00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:40.555
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

211
00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:42.234
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

212
00:17:42.314 --> 00:17:44.315
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- No.

213
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.713
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
I'm trying to tell you.

214
00:17:47.793 --> 00:17:51.073
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

215
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:54.392
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

216
00:17:54.432 --> 00:17:58.752
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

217
00:17:58.832 --> 00:18:02.432
You know what that spells?
J- O-N-E-S.

218
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:05.990
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

219
00:18:07.391 --> 00:18:08.791
- No.
- Gentlemen,

220
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.149
I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

221
00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:14.230
There you go. Straight.

222
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.509
Straight down in the hole.

223
00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:18.389
- There you go.
- Straight...

224
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.388
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

225
00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:29.187
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

226
00:18:29.267 --> 00:18:32.746
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

227
00:18:32.827 --> 00:18:34.467
Let's give her some air, OK?

228
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:37.066
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

229
00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:39.665
Can I get a wheelchair?
It's for Lima One Alpha.

230
00:18:39.745 --> 00:18:43.064
- You OK?
- I think it's time.

231
00:18:45.065 --> 00:18:48.383
Lima, you're going to the Island.

232
00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.344
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

233
00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:53.224
I hope I see you soon.

234
00:18:55.782 --> 00:19:00.462
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

235
00:19:00.502 --> 00:19:02.543
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

236
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.101
That's fair. That's real fair.

237
00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:12.460
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

238
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:18.379
Everyone, back to work.

239
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:20.339
That is so not fair.

240
00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:25.019
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

241
00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:27.059
Tech Services.

242
00:19:27.139 --> 00:19:28.858
Computer's down again.

243
00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:31.657
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

244
00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:35.017
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

245
00:19:35.057 --> 00:19:37.097
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

246
00:20:04.493 --> 00:20:07.371
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

247
00:20:08.531 --> 00:20:12.210
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

248
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.370
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

249
00:20:16.011 --> 00:20:17.570
- What?
- I've been looking...

250
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.449
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

251
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:24.728
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

252
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.009
How you doing, Mac?

253
00:20:26.648 --> 00:20:29.169
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

254
00:20:29.248 --> 00:20:32.048
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

255
00:20:34.248 --> 00:20:37.247
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

256
00:20:37.287 --> 00:20:39.286
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

257
00:20:39.965 --> 00:20:42.567
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

258
00:20:44.127 --> 00:20:46.966
You're a bad influence on me.

259
00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.845
Must be why I like you so much.

260
00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.603
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

261
00:20:57.643 --> 00:21:01.124
It's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

262
00:21:04.322 --> 00:21:07.203
I like coming out here, talking.

263
00:21:07.283 --> 00:21:09.842
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

264
00:21:09.922 --> 00:21:11.003
Yeah.

265
00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:14.480
Step into my office.

266
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.480
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

267
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.399
Where are their clothes?

268
00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:26.719
What's with Dr. Merrick?

269
00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:31.238
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

270
00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:32.358
Yeah.

271
00:21:32.438 --> 00:21:34.639
It's called a God complex.

272
00:21:34.719 --> 00:21:37.638
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

273
00:21:37.718 --> 00:21:39.757
What's God?

274
00:21:39.837 --> 00:21:42.276
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

275
00:21:42.356 --> 00:21:44.476
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

276
00:21:44.516 --> 00:21:48.596
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

277
00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:51.195
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

278
00:21:51.315 --> 00:21:53.394
Yeah, I'll be right there.

279
00:21:56.714 --> 00:21:59.473
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

280
00:21:59.513 --> 00:22:02.314
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

281
00:22:02.394 --> 00:22:05.072
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

282
00:22:05.112 --> 00:22:07.153
You mean from
before the contamination?

283
00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:10.312
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

284
00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:12.153
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

285
00:22:12.193 --> 00:22:15.431
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

286
00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:17.230
Why? Why am I special?

287
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.832
There's another question.

288
00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:21.710
You remember what we talked about?

289
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.231
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

290
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:27.430
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, I don't.

291
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.949
Good.

292
00:23:04.863 --> 00:23:06.583
How's it going?

293
00:23:08.983 --> 00:23:12.022
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

294
00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:14.742
OK, I'll catch you later.

295
00:23:18.622 --> 00:23:20.582
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

296
00:23:20.622 --> 00:23:21.981
Yep.

297
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:23.900
What a surprise.

298
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.580
Go hot.

299
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.539
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

300
00:23:35.139 --> 00:23:37.460
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

301
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.898
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

302
00:23:41.257 --> 00:23:42.458
Ready?

303
00:23:44.418 --> 00:23:45.858
Cut the O2.

304
00:23:47.857 --> 00:23:51.656
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

305
00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.696
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

306
00:24:15.653 --> 00:24:17.331
Breathe.

307
00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:20.773
Come on, yeah. That's it.

308
00:24:23.971 --> 00:24:26.491
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

309
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:27.772
Come on.

310
00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.569
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

311
00:24:31.649 --> 00:24:33.930
There we go.
Now we're working.

312
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.770
He's healthy.

313
00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:39.329
Welcome to the world.

314
00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:44.888
So, how's Three Helo?

315
00:24:44.928 --> 00:24:46.368
Good.

316
00:24:48.408 --> 00:24:50.167
He's feisty. Light.

317
00:24:51.887 --> 00:24:54.527
Vitals seem fine.

318
00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:58.206
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

319
00:25:00.526 --> 00:25:03.126
Looks like we have a fine product.

320
00:25:03.206 --> 00:25:05.365
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

321
00:26:19.353 --> 00:26:21.033
Little bug.

322
00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:09.346
Maybe next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

323
00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:18.544
It was very sad.

324
00:27:19.143 --> 00:27:20.344
- Hey.
- Hello.

325
00:27:20.424 --> 00:27:22.143
Hi.

326
00:27:23.463 --> 00:27:26.342
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

327
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:29.542
Stim units restricted.

328
00:27:29.623 --> 00:27:31.582
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have the veggie stuff.

329
00:27:31.622 --> 00:27:34.340
Papassian petal juice, please.

330
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.062
It's good for the skin.

331
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.219
Jordan, are you sick?

332
00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:54.938
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

333
00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:56.618
No, I'm fine.

334
00:27:57.338 --> 00:27:58.857
OK.

335
00:27:59.457 --> 00:28:01.297
How are you?

336
00:28:01.377 --> 00:28:03.378
I'm fine.

337
00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:05.256
Lincoln, I can tell when you're lying

338
00:28:05.336 --> 00:28:08.456
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

339
00:28:10.854 --> 00:28:11.895
I found something.

340
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:13.175
- What?
- A bug.

341
00:28:13.736 --> 00:28:15.416
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

342
00:28:15.496 --> 00:28:16.414
Can I see it?

343
00:28:16.534 --> 00:28:18.574
I think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

344
00:28:18.654 --> 00:28:21.255
I thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

345
00:28:21.335 --> 00:28:23.773
I know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

346
00:28:23.853 --> 00:28:26.333
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

347
00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:29.533
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

348
00:28:29.613 --> 00:28:32.373
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

349
00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:35.411
It's good that they find survivors.

350
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:39.171
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

351
00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:41.771
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

352
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.970
Good things do happen.

353
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.210
I want to see that bug.

354
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:51.528
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

355
00:28:51.608 --> 00:28:53.649
- What?
- "Dude. "

356
00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:55.130
"Dude"?

357
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.369
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

358
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:59.408
- Hey, dude.
- He said "Hey, dude"?

359
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:01.327
- D-O-O-D. "Dude. "
- Hey, dude.

360
00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:03.047
- Dude.
- Dude.

361
00:29:03.127 --> 00:29:05.568
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

362
00:29:05.648 --> 00:29:06.606
Dude.

363
00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:10.286
Light up all etherscreens.

364
00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:13.486
And... start the lottery.

365
00:29:20.966 --> 00:29:22.165
Good evening.

366
00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:26.244
Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.

367
00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:29.042
It's been a busy week.

368
00:29:29.122 --> 00:29:32.044
We've had a record two winners so far.

369
00:29:32.124 --> 00:29:35.282
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

370
00:29:35.322 --> 00:29:39.482
to the Island, transported
to the world's last paradise.

371
00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:42.720
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

372
00:29:47.761 --> 00:29:50.841
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

373
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.639
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the Island.

374
00:30:00.878 --> 00:30:04.678
For everyone else, never lose hope.

375
00:30:07.277 --> 00:30:09.077
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:30:09.157 --> 00:30:11.797
I can't believe it.

377
00:30:19.274 --> 00:30:21.635
I have to go in the morning.

378
00:30:21.675 --> 00:30:23.596
You were right.

379
00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:27.634
Good things do happen.

380
00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:34.153
I wish I'd known you better.

381
00:30:35.313 --> 00:30:36.912
You two.

382
00:30:36.992 --> 00:30:38.353
Watch your proximity.

383
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.910
I'll see you on the Island.

384
00:31:06.148 --> 00:31:09.466
You want to go to the Island.

385
00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:15.586
Breathe!

386
00:31:16.987 --> 00:31:18.466
You've been chosen.

387
00:31:20.505 --> 00:31:23.466
The Island awaits you.

388
00:32:38.453 --> 00:32:42.253
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

389
00:32:43.572 --> 00:32:46.092
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

390
00:32:46.132 --> 00:32:48.293
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

391
00:33:48.563 --> 00:33:50.722
She's so beautiful.

392
00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:53.961
I've never seen a baby.

393
00:33:54.041 --> 00:33:55.362
Can I hold her?

394
00:33:55.402 --> 00:33:56.881
Not just yet.

395
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:05.359
Are we going to the Island?

396
00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.748
Oh, my God.

397
00:35:22.308 --> 00:35:24.628
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

398
00:35:24.668 --> 00:35:26.427
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

399
00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:28.347
It's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

400
00:35:28.427 --> 00:35:29.626
Whenever you're ready,

401
00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:33.306
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

402
00:35:33.346 --> 00:35:35.986
Look at her. She's beautiful.

403
00:35:38.224 --> 00:35:41.864
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

404
00:35:41.944 --> 00:35:44.584
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

405
00:35:44.664 --> 00:35:46.224
I just love him!

406
00:35:46.904 --> 00:35:49.304
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

407
00:35:49.424 --> 00:35:51.264
Any chance I can make this pickup?

408
00:35:51.344 --> 00:35:53.542
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

409
00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:57.742
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

410
00:35:57.783 --> 00:36:00.982
We don't fly in bad weather.

411
00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:06.981
They look real busy.
So I'd have a seat.

412
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.380
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

413
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.340
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

414
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.379
- Laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

415
00:36:17.459 --> 00:36:20.338
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

416
00:36:20.418 --> 00:36:22.258
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

417
00:36:22.298 --> 00:36:23.457
Prepare that bone saw.

418
00:36:25.378 --> 00:36:27.858
I think we're about ready to open.

419
00:36:45.615 --> 00:36:46.814
Let's clean that drip.

420
00:36:51.373 --> 00:36:53.214
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

421
00:36:55.053 --> 00:36:59.253
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

422
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:05.331
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

423
00:37:07.612 --> 00:37:09.491
Heart rate's still rising.

424
00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:12.650
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

425
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.129
I don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

426
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:24.449
Guards!

427
00:37:25.888 --> 00:37:27.687
Oh, my God!

428
00:37:34.647 --> 00:37:37.407
Stop that man! Get him!

429
00:37:43.686 --> 00:37:45.645
Stop!

430
00:38:01.562 --> 00:38:03.562
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

431
00:38:03.642 --> 00:38:05.642
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

432
00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:10.521
- Relax!
- No!

433
00:38:10.601 --> 00:38:13.041
I don't want to die, no! No!

434
00:38:13.121 --> 00:38:16.800
I want to go to the Island!
You promised!

435
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.159
I wanna live!
I don't wanna die!

436
00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:21.759
No!

437
00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:25.399
Hey.

438
00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:29.558
You OK, buddy? It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

439
00:38:29.638 --> 00:38:32.597
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

440
00:38:43.516 --> 00:38:45.156
Check this part out.

441
00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:47.154
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

442
00:38:47.234 --> 00:38:50.836
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

443
00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:53.354
That is so cruel, man.

444
00:38:54.075 --> 00:38:56.713
Oh, man. Down for the count.

445
00:38:56.793 --> 00:39:00.954
Gentlemen, I understand
there's been an incident.

446
00:39:01.034 --> 00:39:03.913
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

447
00:39:03.993 --> 00:39:06.473
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

448
00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:09.512
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

449
00:39:09.592 --> 00:39:11.671
Play it back, please.

450
00:39:16.471 --> 00:39:18.271
Stop.

451
00:39:18.351 --> 00:39:19.950
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

452
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.229
He was scared, I helped him up.

453
00:39:23.189 --> 00:39:24.589
Play it back at half-speed.

454
00:39:31.149 --> 00:39:32.748
Freeze.

455
00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:35.188
Magnify his wrist.

456
00:39:39.907 --> 00:39:41.706
We have a product on the loose.

457
00:39:42.868 --> 00:39:45.227
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

458
00:39:45.267 --> 00:39:47.705
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

459
00:39:59.904 --> 00:40:02.064
You can't come in here!

460
00:40:07.182 --> 00:40:10.022
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

461
00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.699
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

462
00:40:28.779 --> 00:40:29.699
What?

463
00:40:29.779 --> 00:40:31.898
Move! Move!

464
00:40:40.097 --> 00:40:42.936
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

465
00:40:43.016 --> 00:40:45.258
I want a full contamination lockdown.

466
00:40:45.338 --> 00:40:46.697
Find Six Echo.

467
00:40:49.095 --> 00:40:50.936
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

468
00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:54.055
- I need to see all your faces.
- I don't care what he says, nurse,

469
00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:56.935
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

470
00:40:56.975 --> 00:40:58.615
Check the back corners!

471
00:41:02.615 --> 00:41:06.733
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

472
00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:08.854
Find out.

473
00:41:11.173 --> 00:41:13.692
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

474
00:41:13.772 --> 00:41:14.733
- What?
- I saw them.

475
00:41:14.813 --> 00:41:17.011
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

476
00:41:17.091 --> 00:41:19.531
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

477
00:41:19.611 --> 00:41:21.491
Stop it!
I want to go back to my room.

478
00:41:21.571 --> 00:41:24.331
- They're gonna kill you.
- I'm going to the Island.

479
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:26.491
Jordan, there is no Island!
Come on!

480
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.570
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

481
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.249
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

482
00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:35.649
Get out of the way!

483
00:41:35.769 --> 00:41:37.449
Move! Move!

484
00:41:37.569 --> 00:41:39.569
Out of the way!
Get out. Now.

485
00:41:40.288 --> 00:41:41.408
Just trust me.

486
00:41:45.528 --> 00:41:47.887
This is a community bulletin.

487
00:41:47.967 --> 00:41:49.605
Attention, residents,

488
00:41:49.686 --> 00:41:53.607
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

489
00:41:53.687 --> 00:41:57.925
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

490
00:41:59.965 --> 00:42:02.364
Move! Move!

491
00:42:06.124 --> 00:42:07.723
Freeze! Stop right there!

492
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.001
Go! Go! Go!

493
00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:30.121
Get out of the way!

494
00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:42.399
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

495
00:42:55.597 --> 00:42:57.555
There they are!

496
00:42:57.635 --> 00:43:01.995
I've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

497
00:43:12.913 --> 00:43:14.713
- No!
- Stop!

498
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:26.631
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

499
00:43:26.671 --> 00:43:27.671
No!

500
00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:30.071
Stop it!

501
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.070
No!

502
00:44:09.223 --> 00:44:13.825
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

503
00:44:13.865 --> 00:44:17.343
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

504
00:44:17.463 --> 00:44:20.423
You have a very special purpose.

505
00:44:24.742 --> 00:44:27.622
You want to go to the Island.
Your purpose in life

506
00:44:27.662 --> 00:44:30.502
is to populate the Island.
You're part of a new beginning.

507
00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:34.220
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

508
00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.180
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

509
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.540
You want to go to the Island.

510
00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:47.738
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

511
00:44:51.338 --> 00:44:53.498
Very special.

512
00:44:54.578 --> 00:44:56.458
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

513
00:44:56.538 --> 00:44:58.456
Check over here!

514
00:44:58.496 --> 00:44:59.816
Watch your left!

515
00:45:01.216 --> 00:45:02.337
Run!

516
00:45:05.176 --> 00:45:07.416
Go! Run!

517
00:45:07.456 --> 00:45:08.896
He's over here!

518
00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:17.614
There they are! Go!

519
00:45:30.852 --> 00:45:33.811
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

520
00:45:34.971 --> 00:45:37.411
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

521
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.850
Come on! Come on!

522
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.450
Damn! Go, go! Go!

523
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.130
Come on, let's go!

524
00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:50.569
You still think there's an Island?

525
00:46:01.046 --> 00:46:02.368
Come on!

526
00:46:26.843 --> 00:46:29.163
Come on. Come on!

527
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.120
There's a door over here!

528
00:48:00.628 --> 00:48:05.308
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

529
00:48:05.348 --> 00:48:10.467
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the Island.

530
00:48:10.547 --> 00:48:13.386
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

531
00:48:13.466 --> 00:48:16.986
Sir, I want to focus more than anything.
I love my job. It's interesting.

532
00:48:17.066 --> 00:48:20.065
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

533
00:48:20.145 --> 00:48:23.066
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

534
00:48:23.146 --> 00:48:25.504
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

535
00:48:25.584 --> 00:48:27.623
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

536
00:48:27.703 --> 00:48:29.784
Sir, I have one question.

537
00:48:29.864 --> 00:48:31.904
Where do all the tubes go?

538
00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:36.102
The human organism.

539
00:48:36.182 --> 00:48:39.022
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

540
00:48:39.102 --> 00:48:41.901
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

541
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:45.301
Perfect in every way, except one.

542
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:47.741
Like all machines, it wears out.

543
00:48:49.381 --> 00:48:52.020
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

544
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.099
has been
at the forefront of science.

545
00:48:54.179 --> 00:48:56.259
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

546
00:48:56.339 --> 00:48:58.099
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

547
00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:01.059
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, I finish.

548
00:49:10.937 --> 00:49:12.698
Ladies and gentlemen,

549
00:49:12.778 --> 00:49:16.536
welcome to
the next generation of science,

550
00:49:16.616 --> 00:49:18.496
the agnate.

551
00:49:18.576 --> 00:49:22.535
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

552
00:49:22.615 --> 00:49:24.336
to match the client's age.

553
00:49:24.376 --> 00:49:26.814
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

554
00:49:26.894 --> 00:49:28.214
In its development.

555
00:49:28.294 --> 00:49:30.855
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

556
00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:34.413
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

557
00:49:34.493 --> 00:49:38.493
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

558
00:49:38.613 --> 00:49:43.172
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

559
00:49:43.252 --> 00:49:48.171
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

560
00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.571
They never achieve consciousness.

561
00:49:50.611 --> 00:49:53.729
They never think or suffer

562
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:57.650
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

563
00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.449
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

564
00:50:00.529 --> 00:50:03.169
in every way that matters,

565
00:50:03.249 --> 00:50:05.928
not human.

566
00:50:09.968 --> 00:50:12.968
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

567
00:50:13.048 --> 00:50:15.048
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

568
00:50:15.168 --> 00:50:17.526
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

569
00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:21.486
I want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

570
00:50:22.086 --> 00:50:25.965
And I want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

571
00:50:29.844 --> 00:50:33.044
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

572
00:50:33.124 --> 00:50:36.684
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

573
00:50:36.764 --> 00:50:39.483
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

574
00:50:39.563 --> 00:50:42.283
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

575
00:50:42.363 --> 00:50:45.002
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French Special Forces.

576
00:50:45.122 --> 00:50:47.282
I understand you had a corporate theft.

577
00:50:47.362 --> 00:50:49.682
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

578
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:53.560
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

579
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.641
We've had a... security breach.

580
00:50:56.681 --> 00:51:00.240
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

581
00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:02.799
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

582
00:51:02.879 --> 00:51:06.038
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

583
00:51:06.118 --> 00:51:08.919
And I can't afford
for them to reconsider.

584
00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:11.158
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

585
00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:14.038
I am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

586
00:51:14.118 --> 00:51:15.558
Good.

587
00:51:19.837 --> 00:51:22.078
Two of our products have escaped.

588
00:51:22.118 --> 00:51:24.996
Impressive,
considering they're vegetative.

589
00:51:25.076 --> 00:51:27.836
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

590
00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:30.154
we discovered that
without consciousness,

591
00:51:30.234 --> 00:51:35.434
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

592
00:51:35.514 --> 00:51:37.714
the organs failed.

593
00:51:39.274 --> 00:51:41.273
How long have they been missing?

594
00:51:41.313 --> 00:51:43.993
Four hours and 36 minutes.

595
00:51:44.033 --> 00:51:46.712
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

596
00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:50.512
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

597
00:51:50.592 --> 00:51:53.551
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

598
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:55.031
Follow me.

599
00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:14.589
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

600
00:52:14.669 --> 00:52:15.909
- You gotta try.
- Where?

601
00:52:15.989 --> 00:52:18.387
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

602
00:52:18.507 --> 00:52:21.147
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

603
00:52:26.587 --> 00:52:28.866
What if we are contaminated?

604
00:52:29.425 --> 00:52:31.425
Then we'd be dead.

605
00:52:32.185 --> 00:52:34.745
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

606
00:52:45.584 --> 00:52:48.343
- What is it?
- I don't know.

607
00:52:48.383 --> 00:52:49.982
But it's alive.

608
00:52:54.422 --> 00:52:57.302
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

609
00:52:57.422 --> 00:52:58.621
Let's rest in here.

610
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:01.340
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

611
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.460
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

612
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.181
How long does she have?

613
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:08.619
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

614
00:53:08.659 --> 00:53:10.339
Tell me about Six Echo.

615
00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:13.658
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

616
00:53:13.738 --> 00:53:15.178
his whole existence here.

617
00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:19.298
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

618
00:53:19.378 --> 00:53:22.098
and I can't account for it.

619
00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:24.538
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

620
00:53:24.658 --> 00:53:26.936
What do they know
about the outside world?

621
00:53:27.016 --> 00:53:28.856
Very little.

622
00:53:28.936 --> 00:53:31.896
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

623
00:53:31.976 --> 00:53:36.176
A global contamination.
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

624
00:53:36.215 --> 00:53:40.615
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope,

625
00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:42.615
gives them purpose.

626
00:53:43.134 --> 00:53:45.294
Everything we expose them to,

627
00:53:45.374 --> 00:53:48.854
their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play,

628
00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:52.413
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

629
00:53:52.493 --> 00:53:54.852
To avoid obvious complications,

630
00:53:54.972 --> 00:53:57.493
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

631
00:53:57.613 --> 00:54:00.812
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

632
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:06.411
In a very real sense...
they're like children.

633
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:09.051
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

634
00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:28.766
- What was that?
- I don't know.

635
00:54:30.087 --> 00:54:31.726
But I want one.

636
00:54:45.764 --> 00:54:47.405
Look!

637
00:54:48.205 --> 00:54:51.364
Route 39. Route 39.

638
00:54:51.444 --> 00:54:53.364
Come on.

639
00:54:53.444 --> 00:54:55.482
I got it from a friend.

640
00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:21.239
I think that's it.

641
00:55:51.554 --> 00:55:52.634
What's up?

642
00:55:52.714 --> 00:55:55.274
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

643
00:55:56.833 --> 00:55:58.953
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

644
00:55:59.793 --> 00:56:03.432
- I am.
- And you would be who?

645
00:56:03.512 --> 00:56:06.472
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

646
00:56:07.712 --> 00:56:09.472
Right.

647
00:56:09.552 --> 00:56:12.310
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

648
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:15.310
- U... What? No, I don't think so.
- No.

649
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.550
McCord?

650
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:18.950
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

651
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:21.310
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

652
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.109
A dump? Taking it where?

653
00:56:25.629 --> 00:56:27.868
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

654
00:56:27.948 --> 00:56:31.028
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

655
00:56:31.108 --> 00:56:34.028
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

656
00:56:34.148 --> 00:56:37.026
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

657
00:56:37.107 --> 00:56:39.027
Straight up?

658
00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:51.824
Oh, that is bitchin'.

659
00:56:53.984 --> 00:56:55.704
So this is Sector Five?

660
00:56:55.784 --> 00:56:57.983
Hey! You son of a bitch!

661
00:56:59.664 --> 00:57:01.343
You knew!

662
00:57:01.423 --> 00:57:04.502
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

663
00:57:04.582 --> 00:57:06.342
They're gonna be looking for you.

664
00:57:06.421 --> 00:57:09.502
- Tell me what's going on!
- If anybody sees us together,

665
00:57:09.582 --> 00:57:11.622
both of us are gonna be dead.

666
00:57:11.702 --> 00:57:14.461
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

667
00:57:14.541 --> 00:57:18.660
Let me pull my pants up
and I'll take you back to my place

668
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.460
so we can be alone. OK?

669
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.660
- Ed.
- Mac.

670
00:57:27.499 --> 00:57:29.819
Give you... give you boys a minute?

671
00:57:31.217 --> 00:57:33.658
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

672
00:57:35.738 --> 00:57:37.857
Sure. Sure.

673
00:57:37.937 --> 00:57:39.777
Get out of here, you stupid...

674
00:57:39.817 --> 00:57:41.897
Will you stop?

675
00:57:43.296 --> 00:57:46.576
You cant just bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

676
00:57:47.655 --> 00:57:50.135
She doesn't understand the licking.

677
00:57:50.215 --> 00:57:52.495
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

678
00:57:52.575 --> 00:57:54.534
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

679
00:57:54.614 --> 00:57:56.935
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

680
00:57:57.015 --> 00:57:58.493
No, no, no, that's no good.

681
00:57:58.533 --> 00:58:00.014
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

682
00:58:00.094 --> 00:58:02.494
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

683
00:58:02.574 --> 00:58:04.333
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

684
00:58:04.413 --> 00:58:06.972
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

685
00:58:07.052 --> 00:58:08.934
Don't.

686
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.890
Well, this is nice.

687
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:28.410
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

688
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.769
Do y'all work with him?

689
00:58:31.848 --> 00:58:34.769
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

690
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:37.127
Those are fancy tracksuits.

691
00:58:37.207 --> 00:58:40.768
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

692
00:58:41.728 --> 00:58:45.206
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

693
00:58:45.286 --> 00:58:49.085
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

694
00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:52.126
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

695
00:58:53.407 --> 00:58:54.485
Yeah.

696
00:58:54.565 --> 00:58:57.805
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

697
00:58:57.885 --> 00:59:01.084
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

698
00:59:01.124 --> 00:59:03.363
- Just making friends.
- I know. Good. Just...

699
00:59:03.443 --> 00:59:04.644
Bye.

700
00:59:10.763 --> 00:59:12.122
Why do they lie, Mac?

701
00:59:12.162 --> 00:59:14.722
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

702
00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:20.162
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

703
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:24.400
- What we are?
- What are we?

704
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.360
Man, why do I gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

705
00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.600
OK, look. You're...

706
00:59:36.919 --> 00:59:39.077
Well, you're not like me.

707
00:59:40.798 --> 00:59:43.877
I mean, you're not... human.

708
00:59:45.237 --> 00:59:49.236
I mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

709
00:59:49.356 --> 00:59:53.077
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

710
00:59:56.115 --> 00:59:58.355
You're clones.

711
01:00:00.276 --> 01:00:03.954
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

712
01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.595
- What?
- Clones?

713
01:00:05.675 --> 01:00:07.753
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

714
01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:11.075
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

715
01:00:11.155 --> 01:00:13.193
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

716
01:00:13.273 --> 01:00:15.512
they take it from you.

717
01:00:17.112 --> 01:00:20.232
But I have a mother.
I remember her.

718
01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:22.311
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

719
01:00:22.391 --> 01:00:24.351
I have a little dog and I had a bike.

720
01:00:24.431 --> 01:00:25.912
And a bike. Right.

721
01:00:26.032 --> 01:00:29.270
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

722
01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:31.430
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

723
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.669
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

724
01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:35.989
Yeah.

725
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:40.068
No. Memory imprints.
I seen them.

726
01:00:40.148 --> 01:00:43.229
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

727
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:46.747
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

728
01:00:46.827 --> 01:00:48.947
but they're all pretty much the same.

729
01:00:49.027 --> 01:00:54.227
The life you think you had
before the "contamination,"

730
01:00:54.307 --> 01:00:56.625
it never happened.

731
01:00:57.865 --> 01:01:01.346
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

732
01:01:01.386 --> 01:01:05.385
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

733
01:01:05.465 --> 01:01:06.945
How long?

734
01:01:07.984 --> 01:01:09.584
How long have we been alive?

735
01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:13.543
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

736
01:01:15.142 --> 01:01:16.583
Delta means you're four.

737
01:01:18.983 --> 01:01:20.183
Three?

738
01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:24.060
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

739
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.901
It's the new American dream.

740
01:01:25.981 --> 01:01:29.342
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

741
01:01:29.422 --> 01:01:32.780
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

742
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.940
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

743
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:41.338
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

744
01:01:41.418 --> 01:01:45.019
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

745
01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:48.778
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

746
01:01:48.858 --> 01:01:50.937
They, like, own you.

747
01:01:52.897 --> 01:01:58.576
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

748
01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:03.175
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

749
01:02:04.055 --> 01:02:07.576
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

750
01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:09.815
to have you two hatched?

751
01:02:11.534 --> 01:02:13.695
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

752
01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:16.093
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

753
01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:18.573
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

754
01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:21.173
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

755
01:02:21.213 --> 01:02:22.533
- What?
- Yeah.

756
01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:24.612
No, that's the worst idea I ever heard.

757
01:02:24.692 --> 01:02:27.092
You know how dead I'd be?
Not to mention fired?

758
01:02:27.172 --> 01:02:29.411
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

759
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:32.330
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

760
01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:35.011
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

761
01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:38.250
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

762
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.610
You know what I would do?

763
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.888
I would just get as far away
from here as I could.

764
01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.130
Go to the beach.

765
01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:47.249
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

766
01:02:47.289 --> 01:02:49.168
We're asking for your help.

767
01:02:50.648 --> 01:02:52.408
Oh, God.

768
01:03:00.406 --> 01:03:04.686
Infrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

769
01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:11.244
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

770
01:03:11.324 --> 01:03:15.045
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

771
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.283
- If we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

772
01:03:18.323 --> 01:03:21.043
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

773
01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:22.683
Her sponsor lives in New York.

774
01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:25.643
The number in your name
is a regional code.

775
01:03:25.723 --> 01:03:29.842
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

776
01:03:29.962 --> 01:03:32.000
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

777
01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.521
Put this on.

778
01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:36.521
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

779
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:39.241
Keep going. What size?

780
01:03:40.121 --> 01:03:41.520
All right.

781
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.639
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

782
01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.360
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

783
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.879
We're not idiots.

784
01:03:47.919 --> 01:03:51.239
Excuse me, Miss "I'm so smart
I can't wait to go to the Island. "

785
01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:56.677
Yeah. Good.

786
01:04:01.757 --> 01:04:02.956
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

787
01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:05.436
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

788
01:04:05.516 --> 01:04:07.995
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

789
01:04:10.797 --> 01:04:14.554
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

790
01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.435
All right, listen up.

791
01:04:19.475 --> 01:04:22.434
This card is like stim credits, OK?

792
01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:25.353
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

793
01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:29.312
or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

794
01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:33.311
All right, look.

795
01:04:33.431 --> 01:04:36.312
I know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

796
01:04:36.392 --> 01:04:38.031
but there's one universal truth

797
01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:40.790
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

798
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.431
Right.

799
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:50.788
I got something. It's hot.

800
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:03.467
Oh, God.

801
01:05:05.187 --> 01:05:08.145
- Train four...
- Train'll be here. Hustle.

802
01:05:08.225 --> 01:05:11.627
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

803
01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:15.345
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move.

804
01:05:16.425 --> 01:05:17.824
Mama!

805
01:05:21.504 --> 01:05:23.384
Look at that!

806
01:05:23.424 --> 01:05:25.623
Those are kids.

807
01:05:27.343 --> 01:05:28.824
Wow.

808
01:05:34.302 --> 01:05:37.622
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

809
01:05:37.662 --> 01:05:41.181
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

810
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:42.661
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

811
01:05:42.741 --> 01:05:46.380
- What is an information directory?
- It'll tell you where they live.

812
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.341
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

813
01:05:49.381 --> 01:05:53.299
One thing I can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

814
01:05:53.379 --> 01:05:55.260
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

815
01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:57.978
Thanks a lot.

816
01:05:58.018 --> 01:06:01.459
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

817
01:06:01.498 --> 01:06:03.778
Better not get me in trouble.

818
01:06:14.496 --> 01:06:17.375
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

819
01:06:24.574 --> 01:06:26.814
I think I got an ID.
Two in the center.

820
01:06:32.853 --> 01:06:35.372
Run!

821
01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:08.215
Run!

822
01:08:10.932 --> 01:08:12.052
God!

823
01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:19.486
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.

824
01:08:24.522 --> 01:08:27.359
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

825
01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:43.947
- This was supposed to be a simple job?
- It's never simple.

826
01:08:44.027 --> 01:08:45.586
We got a missing credit card.

827
01:08:45.665 --> 01:08:49.942
McCord just used it to buy train tickets
and it's not in his wallet.

828
01:08:49.982 --> 01:08:54.058
Monitor the account. Have Amtrak
patch you through to the conductor.

829
01:08:55.137 --> 01:08:56.936
Get me a new team in LA.

830
01:08:59.614 --> 01:09:02.412
- Got here as fast as I could.
- Come here.

831
01:09:02.491 --> 01:09:05.569
I finished scanning the Defense
Department Troop Selections,

832
01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:08.127
- if you want to see them...
- Not yet. Look at that.

833
01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:12.764
- Six Echo drew it.
- It's elaborate.

834
01:09:12.843 --> 01:09:16.920
"Renovachio. " Renovatee-oh?

835
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.398
Renovatio.
What is that, Italian?

836
01:09:19.478 --> 01:09:21.396
It's Latin.
