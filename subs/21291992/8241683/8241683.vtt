1
00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:11.573
- I thought you
were coming back Sunday.

2
00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.340
- No, Tuesday.

3
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.207
- Oh.

4
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.210
Okay.

5
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.082
Well, I'm glad you're finally
doing this.

6
00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:24.351
- It'll be fun.

7
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.589
Nice change of pace.

8
00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.823
- For sure.
- Yeah.

9
00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.190
- And we can just-

10
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.626
We'll look at houses next week.

11
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.565
Jo?

12
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.432
- Yeah.

13
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.203
- Anyway, I hope
your brother's doing good.

14
00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.507
And remember, if you hear
a banjo playing, run.

15
00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.410
Have a great time.

16
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.244
Call me when you're
back on the grid, okay?

17
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.847
- Okay, yeah, thank you.

18
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.147
- Be safe.
- All right, bye.

19
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.182
- Bye.

20
00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.379
- If I'm floating in the
water,

21
00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:35.248
keep my feet downstream,
gently bend my knees.

22
00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.584
You'll be floating on your back.

23
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:37.985
Head tucked, knees gently bent.

24
00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.887
- Kiss your ass goodbye.

25
00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:40.955
- Oh, hey.

26
00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.456
She made it.

27
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.391
Hi, kid.
- Sorry I'm late.

28
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.459
- Yeah, that's all right.

29
00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.861
We almost left without you.

30
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:47.862
- I would've chased you down.

31
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.597
- I bet you would've.

32
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.497
- Yeah.

33
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:52.934
You look good.

34
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.334
- Thank you, I feel good.

35
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.402
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.740
Oh, this is my kid, sis, Joey.

37
00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.340
This is Karissa and Van.

38
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.475
They're actually paying to be
here,

39
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:02.442
unlike some free loaders.

40
00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.111
- I tried to pay.

41
00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:04.078
- She didn't try that hard.

42
00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:05.513
- So what, are we
crashing a family holiday?

43
00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:06.748
- No, no, no, no, not at all.

44
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.549
If anything, she's
crashing my place of work.

45
00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.383
- So I bet Trevor's like your
brother

46
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.284
or something, then is he?

47
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.954
- Well, basically, yeah.

48
00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:14.354
- Trevor?

49
00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.022
- Yeah, yeah.

50
00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:15.990
A little surprise.

51
00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:17.859
He was supposed to be off today,

52
00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.494
but heard you were coming
and wanted to join the trip.

53
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:24.031
So, if you could just get
his head out of his ass.

54
00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.201
- Just like old times,
then.

55
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.704
- Yeah, just like Snake
River.

56
00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.507
You need help with your gear?

57
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.041
- No.
- All right.

58
00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:34.876
- Boat's down there.
- I'll be right back.

59
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.777
Okay.
- Great.

60
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.677
Chop chop, 'cause...

61
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.045
Thank you.

62
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.647
Let's get you girls sized up.

63
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.694
- Holy shit.

64
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.530
Not on my river.

65
00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:59.534
- Hey.
- Hey!

66
00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:03.538
- Holy shit, good to see you.
- You, too.

67
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.541
- Holy shit, been a minute.

68
00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:07.307
- Yeah.

69
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.341
Yeah, it's been forever.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.442
How you been?

71
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:11.279
- Yeah, good.

72
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.680
Really good.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:13.413
- Yeah.

74
00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.081
I hear great things.
- Yeah.

75
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:16.083
- I hear good, good things.

76
00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:17.952
Let me ask you a question.

77
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.687
How many lives you saved this
week?

78
00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:23.825
Come on.

79
00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:24.859
- Yeah, I mean, I don't
know, two or three.

80
00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:26.060
- Two or three!

81
00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.061
Just two or three.

82
00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.563
No big deal.

83
00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.031
Holy shit.

84
00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:31.065
Gray told me you're coming.

85
00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.100
It was supposed to be my
weekend off and I said,

86
00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.602
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

87
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.469
I'll be on the boat with Jo
Bean.

88
00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:37.939
We got a lot to catch up on.

89
00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:38.840
- Yeah.

90
00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:39.974
Thank you very much.

91
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.441
How have you been?

92
00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.810
- Me?
- Yeah.

93
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:43.711
- Pretty good.

94
00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.079
Pretty good, yeah.

95
00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:47.447
You know, not in prison anymore.

96
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.516
- I did notice.

97
00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:49.283
- You noticed?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:50.751
- Great.
- When'd that happened?

99
00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:53.588
- Yeah, a little after
Christmas.

100
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.990
And um, yeah, pretty good, you
know?

101
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.726
Gray hooked me up with the job.

102
00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.127
I'm loving this.

103
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.529
On the river every day.

104
00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.130
Getting paid to paddle.

105
00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.632
It's pretty great.

106
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.515
- I remember how.

107
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:22.984
- Except you never did it
right in the first place.

108
00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:23.885
- This isn't right?

109
00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:25.152
- No, your fold's up.

110
00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.654
- I'm a triple folder, bro.

111
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.155
- If the fold's up, it's gonna
leak.

112
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.090
Let me-
- If the fold is up-

113
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:30.024
- Can I just show you how?

114
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.559
- Aw, there it is, it's clicked.

115
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:32.793
- I hope everything gets
wet.

116
00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:33.728
- Hey, Gray?

117
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:34.629
- You can freeze for two
nights.

118
00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.864
- Can I show you this for
a second?

119
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.499
- Is he still texting you?

120
00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.433
- No, he's just asking-
- Give it to me.

121
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.936
- No, it's fine.
- It's going in the river.

122
00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.537
No, it's going in the river.
- It's not fair!

123
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.808
- Jo Bean, you gotta
sign the safety waiver.

124
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.844
- Do I?

125
00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:52.880
Oh, what is this?

126
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.949
Arbitration.

127
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.218
- Give it to me!
- Get off me.

128
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.786
- You are being-

129
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.554
Oh, my God.

130
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.757
- Can you please hurry up and
sign it so I can murder you

131
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.958
without getting in trouble?

132
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:07.895
- Well, now you
can finally get rid of me.

133
00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:08.796
- Geez.

134
00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.197
Gimme that, gee.

135
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:11.532
Girls, hey, girls, girls!

136
00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:12.333
We should load up.

137
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.234
We're burning daylight.
- Okay.

138
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.568
- It's time to float.

139
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:35.690
- Well, I did when
I was in Austria with my dad.

140
00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:39.260
- And she doesn't
know a classic city in America.

141
00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.761
- Boise's the state
capital.

142
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:42.063
It's about nine hours south of
here.

143
00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:42.897
- Oh, cool.

144
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.965
- Where are you all
from?

145
00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:44.966
- We both live in London.

146
00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:46.100
- Yeah, but I'm from Dublin.

147
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:46.968
- Oh.

148
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.704
That's Lucky Charms, right?
- What?

149
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.873
- That's the
Lucky Charms capital.

150
00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:53.741
- Doesn't make no sense.

151
00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.009
I don't know what you're talking
about.

152
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:56.043
- It doesn't make any sense?

153
00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:57.011
You're from Dublin, you
don't know Lucky Charms?

154
00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:57.912
- I'm sorry, should I know a
lucky charms?

155
00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.247
- She's never heard that joke
before.

156
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:01.115
- Trevor, you're better than
this.

157
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:01.949
- It's the first time!

158
00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.718
- You mean the leprechaun?
- Yeah!

159
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:04.652
- Oh, my God the leprechaun?

160
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.253
- Okay, see, she knows the
leprechaun.

161
00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:07.588
- Forgive Trevor.

162
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:09.523
He's lived a very sheltered
life.

163
00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:11.525
- I grew up in a grocery store.

164
00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:13.995
- Is this your first time in the
States?

165
00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:15.596
- No, actually, Van and I,

166
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:17.131
we stopped through Puerto Rico
once.

167
00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:18.265
- Yeah.

168
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.568
- And I went to New York with my
husband.

169
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.736
- And I think that was the last
time

170
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.304
he let you out of the house.

171
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.205
- Oh, come on.

172
00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.306
- They're our friends now, we
can vent!

173
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.575
- It's not worth the oxygen
is that conversation.

174
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.577
- You know I had to jail break
her ass?

175
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.846
- Oh, stop it.
- Yes, I did!

176
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.714
I had to drag you out by your
hair, bitch.

177
00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:35.282
- Does he know you're gone?

178
00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.751
Did you leave pillows under the
blanket?

179
00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:39.253
Did you Ferris Bueller his ass?

180
00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:42.656
- Trevor and I
Ferris Buellered our way

181
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.091
through high school.

182
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:45.826
- Oh.

183
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.030
I hear Ogden pass.
- Mhm.

184
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:49.864
- What's Ogden pass?

185
00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.799
- That is our first
rapids.

186
00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.601
- Only a class two,
though.

187
00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.202
- No, not after yesterday's
rain.

188
00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.137
- Oh my God, man.

189
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.171
Ogden never surges.

190
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.173
- I'm telling you,
storm broke those banks.

191
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.174
Trust me.

192
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.108
- Trust me.

193
00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:02.176
I'll bet you dinner at Lupe's.

194
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.210
- Dinner at Lupe's?
- Yeah.

195
00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:04.779
Storm didn't break shit.
- Oh, Mr .Deep Pockets.

196
00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:05.980
You got yourself a deal.

197
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:09.016
- I got myself a meal.

198
00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:18.559
- Here we go!

199
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:23.064
Left side, left side!

200
00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:28.969
- Come on, Jo Bean!

201
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:32.073
Paying customers are doing all
the work.

202
00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:33.908
- Oh my God!

203
00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.578
- You good?
- Oh my God, no!

204
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.948
- Look at her go!

205
00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:52.960
Here comes the big one!
- Here we go!

206
00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:05.106
Swimmer!

207
00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.956
- Oh my god, it's so much
colder!

208
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.237
- Want some?

209
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.705
- No, I'm good, thank you.

210
00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.011
- You all right?

211
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.081
- Yeah, yeah.

212
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.949
- What's not to be all right
about?

213
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.918
You know?

214
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:51.520
- You both don't have to
do it,

215
00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.820
we can climb back down.

216
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.657
- Sorry about that dip you took.

217
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.431
- Do you guys wanna go
first?

218
00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:06.200
- No, no way, I just got
dry.

219
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:09.069
- Trevor?

220
00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:10.371
- No thanks.

221
00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:12.039
- Because he's afraid of
heights.

222
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.174
- Bull shit!

223
00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:14.742
- True shit.

224
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:15.709
His whole life.

225
00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:16.844
Joey, our tree house.

226
00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.779
Did Trevor ever come up?

227
00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.182
Or did he stay on the ground
scared because he had to-

228
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:21.916
What did you have to do?

229
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:23.417
- I was securing the perimeter.

230
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:26.754
You were scared of dogs.

231
00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:29.223
- Well, you stay there
and secure the perimeter

232
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.991
as an adult man who's
not afraid of heights.

233
00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:33.093
- Let me go up there
and secure your asshole.

234
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:33.662
- God, here he comes.

235
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:34.461
Now we gotta jump, okay?

236
00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.696
3, 2, 1!

237
00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:44.772
- Get back up here!

238
00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.874
I'm not afraid to swim.

239
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:03.757
- I mean, also just use
your brain.

240
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.858
- Nope.

241
00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:05.893
- Yeah, we'll take help.

242
00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:07.928
- I'm just gonna start-

243
00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:10.297
- Okay.
- Poking this in here.

244
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.267
See what that does for you.

245
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.302
That, you want this tension.

246
00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.971
It's good.

247
00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:17.972
- Yeah, so you
go that way and then-

248
00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:21.408
- You gotta start over.

249
00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:22.544
- For this?

250
00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:24.478
For this, you called and
said, I wanna come visit you?

251
00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.247
To play a little bitch game?

252
00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:28.282
- Yeah.

253
00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.117
I missed a little bitch game.

254
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.387
- Well, you just
nominated
yourself as fire starter.

255
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.421
- There we go, in no
time.

256
00:12:34.455 --> 00:12:36.490
All right, who wants to
do the cherry on top?

257
00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:38.058
- Me.
- Tie a little bow.

258
00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:41.929
Let me help you.

259
00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.244
Pull on the hole.

260
00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.280
It's an important job.

261
00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.914
It's the best part.

262
00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.020
- Hey, where is
the best place for me to-

263
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:06.987
I mean, where should I-

264
00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:08.422
- She has to take a piss.

265
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.325
Well, you do.
- Come on.

266
00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:12.860
- Anywhere you like.

267
00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.262
Pick your favorite tree and cop
a lean.

268
00:13:15.296 --> 00:13:16.130
- Okay.

269
00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:20.568
Are there animals around?

270
00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:23.437
- Yeah, there's certainly
animals out here.

271
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.305
- Okay.

272
00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:26.073
- Lots, but they're not gonna
bug you.

273
00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.909
Here, if it makes you feel
better.

274
00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:33.847
- You want this?

275
00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:36.350
- No, thank you.

276
00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:37.552
Looks great, though.
- Sharp.

277
00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:38.319
- Yeah.

278
00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:39.953
- All right.
- Looks dangerous.

279
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.221
- This is bear mace.

280
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.156
You won't need it,

281
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:44.925
but that's the safety, squeeze
it on top.

282
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.460
Make sure you don't point it at
your face.

283
00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.295
- Uh, terrifying.

284
00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:49.196
Thank you.

285
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.164
- Yeah, you got it.

286
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:50.831
- Okay.

287
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.201
- Holler if you need anything.

288
00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:57.237
- I probably will
scream.

289
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.474
- I can feel you looking at me.

290
00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:02.544
- "Holler if you need anything."

291
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:04.646
What's going on with that bulge?

292
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.480
I see it.
- Shut up, man.

293
00:14:06.514 --> 00:14:07.649
- Oh, Gray.
- Use your bulge.

294
00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:09.249
- Give me that tea, Gray.
- Use your bulge.

295
00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:10.618
- Give me that tea.

296
00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:14.421
- Hey, um, do you guys
want some or, I mean,

297
00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:16.390
is it okay that I brought this?

298
00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:18.992
- No.
- No?

299
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:19.594
- You're in trouble.

300
00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:20.528
- I'm in trouble?

301
00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:21.495
- Come on down here to
the fire.

302
00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.263
We have to have a team meeting
about this.

303
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.164
- Oh, okay.

304
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:24.865
If I have to.

305
00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.201
- What are we gonna do?

306
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.169
- Okay, so it's like four
o'clock in the morning I think,

307
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.271
and we've been out since like
eight, okay.

308
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.207
And Care bear goes up to her and
she goes,

309
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.410
"I'll give you five
American dollars for a-"

310
00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.411
- I'm sorry, is
that supposed to be me?

311
00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.046
- That sounds exactly like you.

312
00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:40.047
That's how she sounds.

313
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.182
And she's drunk as well,
so keep that in mind.

314
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.917
And she goes, and this girl
goes,

315
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:46.053
"American Dollar?

316
00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.122
What you mean American Dollar?"

317
00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.657
And you should have seen-

318
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:51.158
- Hold up, I don't get it.

319
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.293
Why'd she, why was the
American dollar thing?

320
00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:54.529
Why was that funny?

321
00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:55.630
- They're in America!

322
00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.699
- I was so drunk
and I maybe forgot that

323
00:14:57.732 --> 00:14:59.233
they use American dollars in
Puerto Rico.

324
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.001
- They use American
dollars in Puerto Rico.

325
00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.203
- So wait, did you get your
cigarette?

326
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:03.937
- No.

327
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:04.839
Shift the conversation, please.

328
00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.407
Joey, do you wanna tell us about
yourself?

329
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.642
Tell us something about you.

330
00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:09.476
- Uh...

331
00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.413
What do you wanna-

332
00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:13.581
what do you wanna know?

333
00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:15.282
- Are you married, are you
married?

334
00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:16.684
- Whoa.

335
00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:17.519
No.

336
00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:18.686
I don't know why that's funny,
but-

337
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.053
- Boyfriend?

338
00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:23.223
- Yeah, sorta.

339
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:23.957
I don't know.

340
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:24.659
- I don't know.

341
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:25.627
What's that mean?

342
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.960
Be honest.

343
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:30.364
- I don't know.

344
00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.699
I mean, he's...

345
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:32.933
He's nice.

346
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.703
He's a nice guy.

347
00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:37.639
- How did you meet him?

348
00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:39.006
- We work together.

349
00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.174
- Mm, doctor.

350
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.009
- Oh, sexy doctor.

351
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.343
- Is he a sexy doctor?

352
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:47.948
- I guess he's like-

353
00:15:48.683 --> 00:15:49.584
He's all right.

354
00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:53.053
He's like, you know, tall and-

355
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.590
He's like stupid tall, actually.

356
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:56.658
- Stupid tall, McStupid
Tall.

357
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:59.193
- Wow, he sounds awful.

358
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.595
- Yeah, it's tall doctor.

359
00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.530
Probably wants a family.

360
00:16:02.564 --> 00:16:04.097
Piece of shit.

361
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:05.265
Guy's like a monster.

362
00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:08.402
- Oh, hey, Gray.

363
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:10.003
You sure you didn't want any?

364
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:11.104
- No, thank you.

365
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:12.707
- Oh, come on.

366
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.775
You're off the clock.

367
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:16.376
And besides, we're all the
best friends now, right?

368
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.346
- A river guide is never off the
clock.

369
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:19.914
- Okay, come on.

370
00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:20.815
When people don't drink,

371
00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.650
that's actually when I get
suspicious.

372
00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:24.084
- You don't need to worry about
me.

373
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.353
It's this idiot you
should be suspicious of.

374
00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:28.890
- Wait, no, no, okay.

375
00:16:28.923 --> 00:16:30.424
So like, look, we can toast,
right?

376
00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:33.728
One toast to our first
day of not drowning.

377
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:34.629
I didn't drown.

378
00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:35.730
- You know what?

379
00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.164
You do a toast for me.

380
00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.533
- Oh, please, just one.

381
00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:39.801
- You do a toast for me.

382
00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.368
- Come on.

383
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:43.103
- Please, just one toast.
- All very good points, but-

384
00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.171
- He's sober.

385
00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:51.646
- Well, that's amazing.

386
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:52.547
Good for you.

387
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.516
- It's nothing, you know.

388
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.758
- On that note, I'm gonna hit
the hay.

389
00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:04.692
It's been fun.

390
00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:05.660
Thank you for a great day.

391
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:07.060
And I'll see everyone in the-

392
00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:08.630
I'm racked.

393
00:17:08.663 --> 00:17:10.464
I've been up for almost 24
hours.

394
00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:12.767
But thank you very much,
it's been a great day.

395
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.668
Enjoy your night.

396
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:15.202
I'll see you in the morning.

397
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.771
- We'll miss you.

398
00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:18.438
- Good night, Joey.

399
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:38.860
- Fill her up.

400
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.460
Fill her up.

401
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:41.461
- Very cool.

402
00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.262
- Thank you.

403
00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.298
That's what these are really
for.

404
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.133
You don't need to be getting up.

405
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.572
- Yeah, hey Karissa.

406
00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:51.806
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

407
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.308
the wind's pushing the smoke
like right in your direction.

408
00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:56.109
You might be better off
if you move to the side.

409
00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.377
- That's a good idea.

410
00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.479
- Karissa, he wants you
to come all the way over

411
00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:01.849
to where it's nice and safe by
him.

412
00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:04.184
Just right next to him.

413
00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:05.720
Give him a sloppy wet kiss.

414
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:06.721
- Oh my God.

415
00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:08.422
- Just give him a kiss.

416
00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:10.290
- On behalf of Kootenai River
Adventures,

417
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:13.160
I would like to apologize
for any inappropriate

418
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.195
and offensive comments made.

419
00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:16.396
- They're buying it.

420
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.732
They're buying it, you're good.

421
00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:18.900
You're covered.

422
00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:21.536
- Okay, well I gotta go visit a
tree.

423
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:22.704
- Oh, okay, be careful.

424
00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:23.705
You should go that way.

425
00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:24.572
- This way?
- Yeah.

426
00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:26.373
I went over there and I nearly
died.

427
00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.142
There's a full on cliff,
seriously.

428
00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:30.678
- Right, okay.

429
00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:38.218
- She should
have taken the bear mace.

430
00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:46.126
- I think I'm gonna do the same
thing.

431
00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:48.395
You should just-

432
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.231
Get outta the smoke.

433
00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.309
- I think Trevor-
- Yeah, yeah.

434
00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:04.779
It sort of followed you, didn't
it?

435
00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:06.614
It's like drawn to you.

436
00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:07.280
- You're so right.

437
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.182
Save me from Trevor's curse.

438
00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.752
I think he cursed me.

439
00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.654
Oh, okay.

440
00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:14.656
It's nice down here.

441
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:15.523
- Mhm.

442
00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:48.990
- Oh, I mean, work.

443
00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:49.824
- I know what you mean.

444
00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.826
I know what you mean.

445
00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:54.227
I worked for Kootenai probably

446
00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.597
a little over three years, now.

447
00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:59.834
But it's not work.

448
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:03.671
Just, it's what I love.

449
00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.840
- But you take it really
seriously, I can see that.

450
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:06.708
- Well, yeah.

451
00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:07.775
You have to, you know.

452
00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.746
And you, what's your thing?

453
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:14.515
- Well,

454
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.752
I was really into fashion.

455
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.920
- Ah.

456
00:20:18.953 --> 00:20:20.320
That's cool. That's cool.

457
00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:25.425
- Yeah, I studied at uni and I
loved it.

458
00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:29.030
And I just, I wanted to, you
know, go.

459
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:30.330
I wanted to go to New York.

460
00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:31.799
I wanted to design.

461
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.004
But then I got married

462
00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:40.608
and he doesn't want me to work.

463
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.247
- That's a bummer.

464
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.791
I dunno.

465
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:57.792
I'd go insane without work.

466
00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.064
I'm serious.

467
00:21:03.097 --> 00:21:05.533
This job saved my life.

468
00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:08.536
They took me in, you know.

469
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.308
Let's just say I didn't have
the best support system.

470
00:21:17.078 --> 00:21:18.646
- Yeah, I get that.

471
00:21:19.714 --> 00:21:20.782
- Yeah.

472
00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.049
- Gray!

473
00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.785
Guys, we need help here!

474
00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:25.418
- What was that?
- Shit.

475
00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.921
Trev, everything okay?

476
00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:28.723
- Hurry!

477
00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:29.389
- Gray?

478
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.660
- Trev, where are you?

479
00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:33.360
- Guys?

480
00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:34.829
- Wait, where's van?

481
00:21:34.862 --> 00:21:35.763
Van?

482
00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:36.697
- Hey!

483
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.397
- Over here.

484
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.365
- Van!

485
00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.033
- Van, where are you?

486
00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.935
- Over here.

487
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.637
- What happened?
- Yeah, she fell.

488
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.404
- What happened, what
happened?

489
00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.540
- Don't get up,
don't get up, don't get up.

490
00:21:45.573 --> 00:21:47.008
Just chill, just hang on.

491
00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.075
Hang on, just stay there.

492
00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:49.409
- Don't touch me.

493
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:50.711
Don't-
- okay, all right.

494
00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:51.779
Wait, wait, wait.

495
00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:52.947
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Can you help me get up?

496
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.848
- Don't move.

497
00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:54.715
We need you to lay down.

498
00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:55.315
- I'm fine.

499
00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:56.217
- Okay?
- I'm fine.

500
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.885
- I'm gonna get you down on the
ground

501
00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:59.419
and lay you down flat, okay?

502
00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:00.087
- I just wanna get up.

503
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:00.955
- What happened?

504
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:01.656
- She tripped.

505
00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:02.389
- It doesn't even hurt.

506
00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:03.691
- Okay, no, that's okay.

507
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:04.391
That's good.

508
00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:05.660
We're just gonna help you, okay?

509
00:22:05.693 --> 00:22:07.460
- Big ass rock right
here that she hit her head on.

510
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.830
- No, no, no, it's okay,
it's okay.

511
00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:09.697
- It doesn't even hurt, okay.

512
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.665
- Hey Trev,

513
00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:11.999
why don't you go get
the first aid kit, yeah?

514
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.568
It's in my bag.

515
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:14.602
- Let me check your eyes.

516
00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:16.637
- Actually, grab the sat
phone, call ranger six.

517
00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:17.872
- We don't need to call anyone.

518
00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.741
- Go get some big sticks so
that I can stabilize her neck.

519
00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:21.976
Go, go.

520
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:22.944
Okay, look at me.

521
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.712
Grab my hands.
- I doesn't even hurt, okay.

522
00:22:24.745 --> 00:22:26.514
- I want you to keep your eyes
open, okay?

523
00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:27.414
Take deep breaths.

524
00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:28.115
- I feel like I'm fine.

525
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.950
Honestly, we don't need-

526
00:22:28.983 --> 00:22:29.650
- I want you to wiggle your
fingers.

527
00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:31.118
Okay, can you lift your feet up?

528
00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:32.053
- Yeah.

529
00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:32.920
- Any numbness, tingling?

530
00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:33.788
- He grabbed me.

531
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:36.524
He grabbed me.

532
00:22:36.557 --> 00:22:37.725
Don't let him come back, please.

533
00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:38.726
- It's okay.

534
00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.694
Just stay with us.

535
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:41.562
- First aid kit.

536
00:22:42.563 --> 00:22:44.599
- How hard did she fall?

537
00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:46.100
- I don't know, not that hard.

538
00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:48.502
- Get up.
- Big ass rock.

539
00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.037
- Any of these work?

540
00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:50.805
- I'm gonna put some
pressure-

541
00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.773
- Sat phone's dead, man.
- What?

542
00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:53.473
- Yeah, yeah.

543
00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:54.342
- It doesn't even hurt.

544
00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:55.309
- Did you swap bricks?
- Yes, always.

545
00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:57.511
- They're both dead.
- Dude, they never work.

546
00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:58.445
- We need to get
her to the hospital.

547
00:22:58.478 --> 00:22:59.412
- Wait, she's fine, right?

548
00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:00.413
- I don't need to go
to the hospital, okay.

549
00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:01.816
I feel like I'm fine.

550
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:02.884
- How far is the road?

551
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:05.019
- There's no road out here.

552
00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:07.021
Ranger station six is closest to
help.

553
00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:08.022
- How far?

554
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:09.489
- It's like half a day hike.

555
00:23:09.523 --> 00:23:10.825
But the river cuts straight
through.

556
00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:12.593
- How long? How long?

557
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:15.062
- With a fast current, two
hours.

558
00:23:15.096 --> 00:23:15.863
- In the dark?

559
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:16.764
- I don't think we have a
choice.

560
00:23:16.797 --> 00:23:19.901
- Listen, we might not have two
hours.

561
00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:21.569
She's got a skull fracture.

562
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:24.404
It's gonna start to swell.

563
00:23:28.142 --> 00:23:30.177
- You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine.

564
00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:31.545
- Please, you're my friend.

565
00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:32.580
Please just help me.

566
00:23:32.613 --> 00:23:33.581
They're freaking me out.

567
00:23:33.614 --> 00:23:34.949
- Is that the fastest way?

568
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:40.453
Gray!

569
00:23:42.857 --> 00:23:43.691
- By far.

570
00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:46.060
- Okay, go.

571
00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:47.161
Start packing up.
Essentials only.

572
00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:48.796
Go, move.

573
00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.605
- Keep her straight.

574
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.876
- Careful, careful.

575
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.511
First this way.

576
00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:05.246
- Keep it even.
Keep it even, guys.

577
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.080
We're almost there.

578
00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:07.181
- You got her?

579
00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:08.015
You got her.
Not too fast.

580
00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:09.583
- Keep her straight.
- Slow, slow.

581
00:24:09.617 --> 00:24:10.618
- Alright, count of
three.

582
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:14.555
1, 2, 3, down.

583
00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:15.790
There you go, easy, easy.

584
00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:16.624
Okay.

585
00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:17.490
All right, there you go.

586
00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:19.126
You're okay.

587
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.994
All right.

588
00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:36.476
- Hey!
- Hello?

589
00:24:37.812 --> 00:24:40.881
- Hello!
Anybody out there?

590
00:24:40.915 --> 00:24:42.249
- We need help!

591
00:24:42.283 --> 00:24:44.218
- Anybody hear us?

592
00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:45.786
- Anybody?

593
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:50.591
- We had the only campsite in
this canyon.

594
00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:51.625
No one's out here.

595
00:24:53.594 --> 00:24:54.228
- Doesn't work, man.

596
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.629
- I'm just looking.

597
00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:56.697
- It didn't charge.

598
00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:57.365
- You were supposed to charge
it.

599
00:24:57.398 --> 00:24:57.932
- I did charge it.

600
00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:59.033
- Well, obviously not.

601
00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:01.836
- Bro, those kits
don't hold their juice.

602
00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:03.671
I told management about it like
10 times.

603
00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:06.607
- Will you guys just
shut up and man the boat?

604
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.075
- Cara? Cara?

605
00:25:09.243 --> 00:25:10.144
- Yeah, hey.

606
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.312
Hey, I'm right here.

607
00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:12.646
Talk to me.

608
00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:14.815
- This is-

609
00:25:16.317 --> 00:25:18.019
This is just like at uni,
remember?

610
00:25:23.591 --> 00:25:26.027
When I dislocated my shoulder?

611
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.328
- Yeah.

612
00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:29.563
Well I told you not to get
on that board, didn't I?

613
00:25:29.597 --> 00:25:32.066
- Oh, can't back down from a
dare.

614
00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:33.534
- That's true.

615
00:25:34.235 --> 00:25:35.069
- Besides,

616
00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:43.344
I knew you'd take care of me.

617
00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:47.148
- Yeah, well, I always
take care of you, don't I?

618
00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:50.317
- And it was worth it for
those cheese toasties.

619
00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:53.320
- Well, okay.

620
00:25:53.354 --> 00:25:55.990
I promise you, we're gonna get
you home

621
00:25:56.023 --> 00:25:58.092
and I am gonna make you
all the cheese toasties

622
00:25:58.125 --> 00:25:59.160
that you can eat, okay?

623
00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:02.596
We'll just get you home.

624
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.065
We'll just get you home.

625
00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:04.965
- Wait,

626
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:07.835
are you burning?

627
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.137
- What?

628
00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.039
- Smells like...

629
00:26:14.308 --> 00:26:15.876
Smells like they're burning.

630
00:26:19.713 --> 00:26:21.649
- Okay, okay, okay, Trevor, hold
her feet.

631
00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:22.950
- Oh my God, what's happening?

632
00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:23.552
Oh my God.

633
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.819
- She's having a seizure.

634
00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:25.820
Help us.

635
00:26:25.853 --> 00:26:28.155
Okay, we're gonna turn
her on her side, okay?

636
00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:29.223
- Is she dying?
- No, no, no.

637
00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:30.357
- Van? Van?

638
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:33.094
- Gently now, hold her head.
- Uh-huh.

639
00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:34.361
- 1, 2, 3.

640
00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:39.333
- Oh my god.

641
00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:40.301
- That's good.

642
00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:42.002
That's good.

643
00:26:42.036 --> 00:26:43.337
Okay, okay.

644
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.905
That's a good girl.

645
00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:46.140
Good, good.

646
00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:51.712
How much further?

647
00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:52.847
- An hour.

648
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.150
I mean, maybe less, but we
got some big water coming.

649
00:26:58.152 --> 00:26:58.986
- Okay.

650
00:27:07.995 --> 00:27:10.030
- Just half a mile
to the Lone Pine bend.

651
00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:13.200
- Okay, we gotta pack her
in.

652
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:24.979
- In case you go overboard,
we'll be able to see you.

653
00:27:28.182 --> 00:27:29.683
Karissa.

654
00:27:29.717 --> 00:27:30.718
And Joey.

655
00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:54.708
Okay, here it comes.

656
00:27:58.379 --> 00:27:59.413
On my call.

657
00:27:59.446 --> 00:28:01.182
Left and right.

658
00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:02.950
Listen for my voice.

659
00:28:03.951 --> 00:28:05.319
Left!

660
00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:06.453
Left!

661
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:08.088
Now right!

662
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:08.956
Right!

663
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.958
Go together.

664
00:28:15.863 --> 00:28:17.097
Now left, left!

665
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.104
Right!

666
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.360
- Karissa! T-Grade!

667
00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:48.762
- Yep, I got it, I got it.

668
00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.130
- Leave us some
more room on the haystack.

669
00:28:50.164 --> 00:28:51.465
- I got it!

670
00:28:51.498 --> 00:28:53.000
- Row, row, row!

671
00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:56.737
Okay, guys, brace!

672
00:29:00.542 --> 00:29:02.409
- I got it, I got it.

673
00:29:02.443 --> 00:29:04.111
- All right, get ready to
dig.

674
00:29:04.144 --> 00:29:05.913
- I can't see shit!

675
00:29:05.946 --> 00:29:07.848
- Trevor, help me out.

676
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:09.183
Hard on the left.

677
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:10.150
Trevor.

678
00:29:10.184 --> 00:29:11.151
Left, Trevor!

679
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:32.339
- Grab on to something!

680
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:36.844
Joey!

681
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.280
- Gray!

682
00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:40.548
- Where's Van?

683
00:29:40.582 --> 00:29:42.783
- I don't know!

684
00:29:56.063 --> 00:29:56.897
Karissa!

685
00:29:58.566 --> 00:29:59.400
Karissa!

686
00:30:03.871 --> 00:30:05.005
- Van!

687
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.576
No, no, no, no, no!

688
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.810
Van!

689
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:13.213
I got you, I got you, I got you.

690
00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:30.831
- Oh, God.

691
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.867
Gray!

692
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:35.035
- Joey?

693
00:30:35.069 --> 00:30:36.370
Joey, over here.
- I'm coming!

694
00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:38.005
- I've got Van!

695
00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:40.074
I don't think she's breathing.

696
00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:42.309
I can't tell, I can't tell.

697
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:44.912
Where's Karissa?

698
00:30:44.945 --> 00:30:45.647
- I don't know, I lost her.

699
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.481
- Okay, I gotta find-

700
00:30:47.515 --> 00:30:48.482
Have you seen Trevor?

701
00:30:48.516 --> 00:30:49.350
- I got you.

702
00:30:49.383 --> 00:30:50.351
- Trevor!

703
00:30:50.384 --> 00:30:51.251
Trevor!

704
00:30:57.391 --> 00:30:59.226
- Come on, girl.

705
00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:03.297
- Karissa!

706
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.965
Trevor!
- Over here!

707
00:31:07.635 --> 00:31:08.969
Help me!
- I got you.

708
00:31:09.002 --> 00:31:10.505
- You got eyes on
Karissa?

709
00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:12.540
I haven't seen her.

710
00:31:12.574 --> 00:31:14.074
- Van!

711
00:31:15.175 --> 00:31:16.009
Van!

712
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:22.416
- Hey, you got me?

713
00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:23.917
- Yeah, I got you.

714
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.986
- I got you.
- Okay, all right.

715
00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:28.656
Gimme your hand.
- Careful!

716
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.158
- Gimme your hand.

717
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:32.025
Come on.

718
00:31:34.294 --> 00:31:35.896
I got you, come on!

719
00:31:36.698 --> 00:31:37.898
Take it!

720
00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:41.001
Come on!

721
00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:42.236
Take it, yeah!

722
00:31:47.374 --> 00:31:48.208
Come on!

723
00:31:57.985 --> 00:31:58.887
You all right, you okay?

724
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.655
I'll get her warm.
- I'll get our stuff.

725
00:32:00.688 --> 00:32:02.289
- Okay yes, sir.

726
00:32:02.322 --> 00:32:03.023
I'll get her.

727
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.024
Come with me.

728
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.327
- Here, here.

729
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:08.295
Breathe. Breathe!

730
00:32:08.328 --> 00:32:09.163
Breathe deep.

731
00:32:10.698 --> 00:32:11.965
Are you okay?

732
00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:12.667
- I'm so cold.

733
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.535
- Here, here!

734
00:32:13.568 --> 00:32:14.101
Huddle, huddle.
- Is Van breathing?

735
00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:14.803
- Get close together.

736
00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:15.670
- Is she breathing?
- Yes!

737
00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:17.471
- Are you okay?
- Need to get warm.

738
00:32:17.505 --> 00:32:18.439
- I'm gonna get-
- Wait!

739
00:32:18.472 --> 00:32:19.707
I need to talk to you.

740
00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:21.576
- I think he did that on
purpose.

741
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:23.678
Flipped us, flipped the boat.

742
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.512
- What?

743
00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:26.614
- He doesn't want us to get
help.

744
00:32:26.648 --> 00:32:27.481
- Joey, we don't have time for
this.

745
00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:28.348
- Listen to me.

746
00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:29.416
He attacked her.

747
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.685
She told me what happened.

748
00:32:30.718 --> 00:32:32.386
- He wouldn't do that.

749
00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:34.054
- He doesn't want her to tell
anyone.

750
00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:35.122
- What and then just let her
die?

751
00:32:35.155 --> 00:32:36.390
- Yes, to save his own ass.

752
00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:37.725
- No, listen.
- Yes.

753
00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:38.526
- Everyone okay?
- Yes.

754
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.461
- Yeah, yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

755
00:32:40.494 --> 00:32:41.995
- You got the gear, okay.

756
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:43.263
- Yeah, it's down there.

757
00:32:43.297 --> 00:32:43.832
- We still got 40 minutes
to the ranger station.

758
00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:44.666
I'm gonna prep the boat.

759
00:32:44.699 --> 00:32:47.134
- Okay, I'm gonna check you,
okay?

760
00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:49.336
Take some deep breaths in and
out.

761
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.440
Okay, relax your body.

762
00:32:53.474 --> 00:32:54.509
Relax your body.

763
00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:55.677
Okay.

764
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.377
You're gonna be okay. Okay?

765
00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:39.286
- Walt's probably not even there
yet.

766
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:42.289
- Well, you can break
in and use the landline.

767
00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:43.591
- How long?

768
00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:46.661
- Ranger says she's just
at the top of this hill.

769
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:49.396
We can have a medevac here in 15
minutes.

770
00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:50.264
- Hurry.

771
00:34:06.648 --> 00:34:08.081
- Hey, hey, hold up, hold up.

772
00:34:08.115 --> 00:34:08.783
- You alright?

773
00:34:08.816 --> 00:34:09.517
- Hold up, yeah.

774
00:34:09.551 --> 00:34:12.720
What was she saying back there?

775
00:34:12.754 --> 00:34:13.621
- Who?

776
00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:14.556
- Joey.

777
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:15.188
You guys were arguing.

778
00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:16.189
- Oh, that was nothing.

779
00:34:16.223 --> 00:34:17.157
You know how she gets.

780
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.859
- Okay, okay, hey, hey.

781
00:34:17.892 --> 00:34:18.860
You got me though, right?

782
00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:20.762
'Cause you know there's
gonna be questions.

783
00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:21.563
- Dude.
- I'm a felon.

784
00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:22.597
I'm a felon.

785
00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:24.566
You see how people look at me?

786
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.432
- That's all in your head.

787
00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:26.734
- Right, okay.

788
00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:28.168
Is it?

789
00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:30.170
I don't think it is.

790
00:34:30.203 --> 00:34:32.172
- Trevor, you didn't do anything
wrong.

791
00:34:32.205 --> 00:34:34.441
- Yeah, no shit I didn't
do anything wrong.

792
00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:36.644
Tell me, you got me.

793
00:34:36.678 --> 00:34:38.846
- I got you, yeah?

794
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.113
- I'm not going back.

795
00:34:40.147 --> 00:34:40.782
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

796
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:41.683
- I'm on probation.

797
00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:42.850
- I know that, all right?

798
00:34:42.884 --> 00:34:44.886
It's okay, calm down.

799
00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:47.387
- I did three years for you.

800
00:34:49.624 --> 00:34:53.561
Three years, you tell me that
you got me!

801
00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:54.428
Tell me!

802
00:34:57.397 --> 00:34:58.365
- I got you.

803
00:34:59.266 --> 00:35:01.468
I got you, all right?

804
00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:02.369
I got you!

805
00:35:04.438 --> 00:35:07.609
Come here, man, come here, I got
you.

806
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:08.876
I got you, okay?

807
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:09.744
I got you.

808
00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:10.678
- Okay.

809
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:11.512
- You got me?

810
00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:12.312
- I got you.

811
00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:13.480
- I got you, all right?
- Okay.

812
00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:14.515
- We gotta go.

813
00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:28.161
- How's she doing?

814
00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:28.863
- She's breathing.

815
00:35:28.896 --> 00:35:30.230
So it's good.

816
00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:33.367
- She dry?

817
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.536
- Yeah, I think so mostly.

818
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.638
- How are You?

819
00:35:36.671 --> 00:35:38.405
- Okay, how are you?

820
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.708
- No truck.

821
00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:41.576
- Walt!

822
00:35:45.813 --> 00:35:46.648
Walt!

823
00:35:48.683 --> 00:35:49.550
- Okay.

824
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.222
Walt?

825
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:56.658
Walt you in there?

826
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.228
Hey.

827
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:13.541
We got a head wound, it's bad.

828
00:36:13.574 --> 00:36:14.609
- Where at?

829
00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:15.810
- Down by the shore, we're
gonna need a chopper.

830
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.177
- Oh, Christ.

831
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.282
- She slipped and hit
her head on some rocks.

832
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.718
The sat phone died on us.

833
00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:25.218
It's been a couple hours, man.

834
00:36:25.252 --> 00:36:26.788
We need someone fast.

835
00:36:29.322 --> 00:36:30.658
- Okay, just wait a second, wait
a second.

836
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:31.258
- What?

837
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.026
- We don't need all that.

838
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.960
It's not that-
- It is that bad.

839
00:36:32.994 --> 00:36:33.861
- No, no.

840
00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:34.796
- It's very bad.

841
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:35.362
- No, we should put her in
Walt's truck.

842
00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:36.631
It's probably faster.

843
00:36:36.664 --> 00:36:37.364
- What are you talking about?
- How about we call it in, okay?

844
00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:38.966
Let them tell us what's faster.

845
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.867
- Exactly.

846
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:40.802
- Wait, wait.

847
00:36:40.835 --> 00:36:41.803
- Hear us out, look.

848
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:43.971
We're already in some
shit over last week's

849
00:36:44.005 --> 00:36:46.440
cabrewers with management, so...

850
00:36:46.473 --> 00:36:47.875
just we would like to not report
it.

851
00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:49.476
- Look, of this is a medical
emergency.

852
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.578
No, we've gotta call it...

853
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.846
Doesn't matter if...

854
00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:52.747
- There's a doctor...

855
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.715
- Just give me the radio.

856
00:36:53.748 --> 00:36:54.649
- Trevor, it's gonna be fine.

857
00:36:54.682 --> 00:36:55.482
- You don't know that!

858
00:36:55.516 --> 00:36:57.451
- Just give me the god damn
radio!

859
00:36:57.484 --> 00:36:57.985
- Whoa!

860
00:36:58.019 --> 00:36:59.486
- Come on, dude.

861
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.489
- All right, guys, guys, guys.

862
00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:03.124
- Sorry.

863
00:37:03.157 --> 00:37:03.958
- Walt, he's cool alright.

864
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:04.992
- We're done. Right?

865
00:37:05.026 --> 00:37:05.893
- Yeah...

866
00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:06.828
- We're sorry?

867
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:07.729
- I'm done.

868
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.597
- You're done?

869
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.363
- Yeah.

870
00:37:10.397 --> 00:37:11.264
- Everybody's okay

871
00:37:11.298 --> 00:37:11.966
Everybody's okay.

872
00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:13.601
Whoa no, Trevor...

873
00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:14.602
drop it Walt.

874
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.038
Guys!

875
00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:18.740
- Stop!

876
00:37:18.773 --> 00:37:19.974
- He's trying to shoot me! dead

877
00:37:20.942 --> 00:37:21.809
- Oh shit!

878
00:37:21.843 --> 00:37:23.310
- Oh shit! Trevor, please just
let go.

879
00:37:23.343 --> 00:37:24.712
- What the hell you doing, man.

880
00:37:24.746 --> 00:37:25.646
- Guys, come on.

881
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.246
Drop the gun.

882
00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.915
Just drop the gun, God!

883
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:29.316
Trevor get down.

884
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:32.186
Let go.

885
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.021
Let go, Trevor, let go.

886
00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:35.857
Oh, guys, guys, come on!

887
00:37:36.724 --> 00:37:37.592
No!

888
00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:45.533
- What'd you do?

889
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.872
- I'm sorry, man.

890
00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:51.739
- What'd you....?

891
00:37:51.773 --> 00:37:53.306
- Oh God.

892
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.041
I'm sorry, Walt.

893
00:37:54.075 --> 00:37:54.909
You're alright. You're alright.

894
00:37:54.942 --> 00:37:55.777
- Did you stab him?

895
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.711
Alright. No, no.

896
00:37:56.744 --> 00:37:57.879
- Walt, I'm sorry, man.

897
00:37:57.912 --> 00:37:58.780
I'm sorry.

898
00:37:58.813 --> 00:37:59.680
You all right ,bro?

899
00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:00.548
- Walt, you okay?

900
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:01.082
I got you.

901
00:38:01.115 --> 00:38:01.983
Whoa, whoa.

902
00:38:02.016 --> 00:38:03.350
Careful. Careful.

903
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:05.520
- Oh, Trevor.

904
00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:06.087
It's okay.

905
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.954
Are you okay, buddy?

906
00:38:06.988 --> 00:38:07.855
He's okay.

907
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:08.723
Oh, shoot.

908
00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:09.322
Oh, no.

909
00:38:09.356 --> 00:38:10.390
Okay. Keep pressure here.

910
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.058
Keep pressure here.

911
00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:11.926
Keep pressure.

912
00:38:11.959 --> 00:38:12.894
Look at me.

913
00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:14.662
Oh here, here, here.

914
00:38:14.695 --> 00:38:15.563
Move. Okay.

915
00:38:16.396 --> 00:38:17.665
I know, I know.

916
00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:18.232
Keep pressure.

917
00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:19.499
You gotta keep pressure.

918
00:38:19.534 --> 00:38:22.036
Walt where's the first aid kit?

919
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:23.938
Okay, here we go.

920
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:24.906
Okay.

921
00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:26.439
Okay. You're doing great.

922
00:38:26.473 --> 00:38:26.874
You'll be fine.

923
00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:29.043
It's okay.

924
00:38:29.076 --> 00:38:30.443
You'll be fine.

925
00:38:30.477 --> 00:38:31.712
All right. It's okay.

926
00:38:31.746 --> 00:38:32.780
Here we go.

927
00:38:32.814 --> 00:38:33.714
Put this.

928
00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:34.949
Okay. 3, 2, 1.

929
00:38:34.982 --> 00:38:35.850
I know.

930
00:38:35.883 --> 00:38:36.717
I know.

931
00:38:47.028 --> 00:38:49.496
- Walt we need your help buddy.

932
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.932
We need your help.

933
00:39:00.575 --> 00:39:03.845
Keep your eyes open and look at
me.

934
00:39:03.878 --> 00:39:05.412
Come on.

935
00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:07.849
Trev. You gotta call for help?

936
00:39:22.697 --> 00:39:23.731
- Oh, come on.

937
00:39:24.765 --> 00:39:26.033
Come, come.

938
00:39:26.067 --> 00:39:27.969
Keep pressure.

939
00:39:28.002 --> 00:39:28.836
Oh God.

940
00:39:32.874 --> 00:39:33.841
Did you call?

941
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.144
- Let him go?

942
00:39:37.178 --> 00:39:38.378
- Trevor.

943
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.480
- Great, brother.

944
00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:42.016
Walk away yeah.

945
00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:42.917
- What?

946
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.120
- Walk away.

947
00:39:46.153 --> 00:39:47.655
Just let him go.

948
00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:53.794
- Trev I know you're not
pointing that gun at me.

949
00:39:56.664 --> 00:39:57.497
Come on.

950
00:39:57.531 --> 00:39:58.199
- We gotta help him.

951
00:39:58.232 --> 00:39:59.100
- He's done.

952
00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:00.868
- No It's not too late.

953
00:40:00.902 --> 00:40:01.769
We can save him.

954
00:40:01.802 --> 00:40:02.570
- And then what?

955
00:40:02.603 --> 00:40:05.673
- And then you're not a
murderer!

956
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:06.207
Whoa, whoa.

957
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.108
Come on man.

958
00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:07.975
Open your eyes.

959
00:40:08.009 --> 00:40:09.510
Come on.

960
00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:10.945
- He's just done.

961
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:12.013
He's done looking at him.

962
00:40:12.046 --> 00:40:12.914
He's done.

963
00:40:12.947 --> 00:40:14.515
It's on me.

964
00:40:14.548 --> 00:40:15.750
- You're making it so much
worse.

965
00:40:15.783 --> 00:40:16.918
- I know!

966
00:40:16.951 --> 00:40:18.819
You don't think I know!

967
00:40:20.755 --> 00:40:21.756
Look at him.

968
00:40:21.789 --> 00:40:23.057
Look, he's not even moving
anymore.

969
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.158
- Come on Wal, Walt.

970
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:25.059
Come on Walt.

971
00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:25.927
No. No.

972
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:30.164
- Okay. We still gotta
call at least for a van.

973
00:40:30.197 --> 00:40:31.132
- No!

974
00:40:33.968 --> 00:40:36.170
No one's calling anyone!

975
00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:44.578
- I have a plan.

976
00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:48.082
You still got me right?

977
00:42:09.296 --> 00:42:10.131
- What are you doing?

978
00:42:10.164 --> 00:42:13.100
- They should have been back by
now.

979
00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:23.277
- They're coming.

980
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.245
- New plan.

981
00:42:24.278 --> 00:42:26.614
We can get back in the
boat and head north.

982
00:42:26.647 --> 00:42:28.916
- Wait, what are you talking
about?

983
00:42:28.949 --> 00:42:32.253
- There's a tributary we'll
split off on.

984
00:42:32.286 --> 00:42:34.655
It's a shortcut to Canada.

985
00:42:35.823 --> 00:42:37.958
There's no border patrol.

986
00:42:39.627 --> 00:42:41.562
- Where's the ranger?

987
00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:44.065
- He's dead.

988
00:42:45.766 --> 00:42:48.169
No stop until we get to Canada.

989
00:42:52.773 --> 00:42:57.111
- Gray... don't let him do
this.

990
00:43:10.758 --> 00:43:12.026
So we're hostages now.

991
00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:13.227
- Just get me to Canada.

992
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.695
You're all free to go.

993
00:43:14.728 --> 00:43:16.597
- She won't make it.

994
00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:22.369
She will die if we get back on
the water.

995
00:43:22.403 --> 00:43:23.337
And you're okay with that?

996
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.405
You're okay letting her die?

997
00:43:24.438 --> 00:43:25.339
- No!

998
00:43:25.372 --> 00:43:27.141
I'm not okay with it.

999
00:43:29.276 --> 00:43:30.778
Get in the boat.

1000
00:43:34.415 --> 00:43:35.983
Let's go come on.

1001
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:40.121
- Let's go.

1002
00:46:04.465 --> 00:46:05.766
- Hey there.

1003
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.137
You guys all right?

1004
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.105
- Hey, yeah.

1005
00:46:12.406 --> 00:46:13.907
You?

1006
00:46:13.941 --> 00:46:16.110
- You guys need some help?

1007
00:46:18.045 --> 00:46:18.912
- No.

1008
00:46:18.946 --> 00:46:20.582
She just had a little fall.

1009
00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:22.182
She's good.

1010
00:46:22.216 --> 00:46:25.853
And she's a doctor, so
she's in good hands.

1011
00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:27.221
Where you headed?

1012
00:46:29.189 --> 00:46:30.592
- I'm just up here.

1013
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:33.294
Just few miles up past
Horseshoe.

1014
00:46:33.327 --> 00:46:34.529
There's a really nice
camping spot out there.

1015
00:46:34.562 --> 00:46:36.163
- Oh yeah sure.

1016
00:46:36.196 --> 00:46:36.731
Gorgeous.

1017
00:46:36.765 --> 00:46:38.499
- Have you been there?

1018
00:46:38.533 --> 00:46:41.068
- Yeah, but I've been meaning to
get back.

1019
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:45.172
Listen, if you guys need
me to go get help I can.

1020
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.608
- No, no.

1021
00:46:46.641 --> 00:46:48.042
It's okay.

1022
00:46:48.075 --> 00:46:51.345
We got our car at the next
takeout.

1023
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:52.012
- Got it.

1024
00:46:54.348 --> 00:46:56.518
Hope your friend feels better.

1025
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:57.918
- Yeah, man. Thanks.

1026
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:59.119
Have a good one.

1027
00:46:59.153 --> 00:46:59.987
- Yep.

1028
00:47:15.035 --> 00:47:16.003
- God damn it he knows.

1029
00:47:16.036 --> 00:47:17.471
We gotta find a way up there.

1030
00:47:17.505 --> 00:47:18.372
- To do what?

1031
00:47:18.405 --> 00:47:19.239
- I don't know.

1032
00:47:19.273 --> 00:47:20.140
Talk to him.

1033
00:47:20.174 --> 00:47:20.809
I don't know.

1034
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:21.576
- He doesn't know anything.

1035
00:47:21.609 --> 00:47:23.077
- Unless he's blind.

1036
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.345
He can clearly see there's
a dead girl on the raft.

1037
00:47:24.378 --> 00:47:25.245
- Trev.

1038
00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:27.448
- He's going for help right now
100%.

1039
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.616
- I promise you he's not.

1040
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.450
- You promise me?

1041
00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:31.619
'Cause you know everything,
right?

1042
00:47:31.653 --> 00:47:34.121
Why you gonna say your serenity
prayer?

1043
00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:34.922
Huh?

1044
00:47:34.955 --> 00:47:36.256
God Gimme this strength.

1045
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.991
Go gimme this drink.

1046
00:47:41.462 --> 00:47:42.296
Okay.

1047
00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:43.631
Hey.

1048
00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.199
Gray. I'm sorry.

1049
00:47:46.634 --> 00:47:47.434
I'm sorry, man.

1050
00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.203
Okay, let's push through the
night.

1051
00:47:49.236 --> 00:47:50.638
- No, no.

1052
00:47:50.672 --> 00:47:52.139
- He's going for help right now.

1053
00:47:52.172 --> 00:47:53.608
And he's going to find somebody

1054
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:54.609
and they're going to catch up.

1055
00:47:54.642 --> 00:47:55.510
- No, we can't do it.

1056
00:47:55.543 --> 00:47:56.611
Okay. We cannot do it.

1057
00:47:56.644 --> 00:47:57.911
We will not survive.

1058
00:47:57.945 --> 00:47:59.146
I'm drawing the line.

1059
00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:02.015
Lone pine is one thing, but
in broad daylight, you can't.

1060
00:48:02.049 --> 00:48:04.184
I won't allow it.

1061
00:48:04.218 --> 00:48:07.154
- Who's got the gun here,
brother.

1062
00:48:08.656 --> 00:48:10.525
- You do big man.

1063
00:48:10.558 --> 00:48:12.292
So pull the trigger.

1064
00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:15.530
'Cause if you make us go
over the beast at night,

1065
00:48:15.563 --> 00:48:18.432
you're killing us anyway.

1066
00:48:18.465 --> 00:48:19.400
We can't do it.

1067
00:48:19.433 --> 00:48:20.434
Okay. We can't do it.

1068
00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:21.669
If you want to get to Canada

1069
00:48:21.703 --> 00:48:24.338
if you want to get through
this, we need to work together.

1070
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:26.708
Even if he's going to get help
right now

1071
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.410
we're splitting off in
two miles of boundary run.

1072
00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:34.047
No one goes that way unless
they're doing the beast.

1073
00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:44.992
- Okay, let's split off everyone
paddle.

1074
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:47.327
Pick up a paddle everyone go.

1075
00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:39.246
- All right.

1076
00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:41.982
I think we're deep enough in.

1077
00:49:45.118 --> 00:49:48.088
These girls can't paddle much
more.

1078
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.258
- Okay find an easy takeout.

1079
00:49:52.794 --> 00:49:56.396
Somewhere with soft
soil so we can bury her.

1080
00:49:58.398 --> 00:49:59.299
- Bury her?

1081
00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:06.273
I can't just

1082
00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:08.408
- We have to.

1083
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:14.414
There's too much weight
for the last lake tomorrow.

1084
00:51:56.249 --> 00:51:57.652
- How much further

1085
00:51:59.252 --> 00:52:01.488
- Until no one can find us.

1086
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.837
- Be an awful quiet up there,
brother.

1087
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.873
You thinking about how to get
this gun?

1088
00:52:18.906 --> 00:52:20.775
So I'm a bad guy now.

1089
00:52:20.808 --> 00:52:21.676
Yeah.

1090
00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:25.780
After all I did for you.

1091
00:52:25.813 --> 00:52:27.447
She doesn't even know, does she?

1092
00:52:27.481 --> 00:52:28.348
Do you?

1093
00:52:28.382 --> 00:52:31.385
You know about this guy's side
hustle?

1094
00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:31.919
Not mine.

1095
00:52:31.953 --> 00:52:32.820
Mind you his.

1096
00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:33.721
- Trev!

1097
00:52:33.755 --> 00:52:34.656
- What?

1098
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:35.523
You were good at it.

1099
00:52:35.556 --> 00:52:37.324
Hey, hold up.

1100
00:52:37.357 --> 00:52:40.327
This guy was slinging more
rock than anyone in East Boise.

1101
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.396
He had a real good run.

1102
00:52:43.296 --> 00:52:44.666
Keep walking. Go.

1103
00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:50.938
- This Dayton
got her pregnant?

1104
00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:53.273
I couldn't let him do
time for distribution.

1105
00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:56.243
Not when he had something good.

1106
00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:57.177
I didn't have anything.

1107
00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.946
But this life was turning into
something.

1108
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.449
I couldn't let that get all
messed up.

1109
00:53:02.482 --> 00:53:03.951
I was home when the cops busted
in.

1110
00:53:03.985 --> 00:53:04.919
- I didn't ask you to.

1111
00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:06.621
- You didn't have to.

1112
00:53:06.654 --> 00:53:10.357
I knew what to do because we're
brothers.

1113
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.859
I cracked.

1114
00:53:11.893 --> 00:53:14.529
The only family I ever had man.

1115
00:53:15.596 --> 00:53:17.197
You too Joey Bean.

1116
00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:20.601
You look a little sister to me.

1117
00:53:24.038 --> 00:53:25.238
Let's go.

1118
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.625
Sorry does that hurt?

1119
00:53:48.763 --> 00:53:49.597
The cold?

1120
00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:33.808
Look...

1121
00:54:36.844 --> 00:54:39.747
I promise, we're gonna make it.

1122
00:54:45.352 --> 00:54:48.689
Everyone just stressed
up we got a big day.

1123
00:55:20.588 --> 00:55:21.956
Remember that song we used to
sing

1124
00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:24.457
in our tents off Snake River.

1125
00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:56.717
- You promised.

1126
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.923
She said you weren't involved.

1127
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:08.729
- I was so out of my mind back
then.

1128
00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:10.531
Didn't even know what I was
doing.

1129
00:57:10.564 --> 00:57:13.567
- Probably whatever he wanted
you to.

1130
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:17.672
- God, you're still his bitch.

1131
00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:18.205
No?

1132
00:57:18.239 --> 00:57:19.941
- No.

1133
00:57:19.974 --> 00:57:20.942
- Then do something.

1134
00:57:20.975 --> 00:57:22.209
I'm tied up too.

1135
00:57:22.243 --> 00:57:23.177
- You had chances.

1136
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.245
- You'll have more.

1137
00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:25.846
- He has a gun.

1138
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.648
Do you really think I'm
okay with any of this?

1139
00:57:27.682 --> 00:57:29.850
- It's between me and him.

1140
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.821
It'll always be him.

1141
00:57:36.857 --> 00:57:38.458
- That's not true.

1142
00:58:05.686 --> 00:58:06.754
- The summer.

1143
00:58:15.696 --> 00:58:18.566
The summer you rented the cabin.

1144
00:58:29.243 --> 00:58:30.077
You...

1145
00:58:40.054 --> 00:58:41.822
You let him...

1146
00:58:44.892 --> 00:58:45.993
use me.

1147
00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:54.735
Like a toy, like a gift.

1148
00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:01.542
- No, what?

1149
00:59:02.343 --> 00:59:03.878
You liked him.

1150
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:04.845
You...

1151
00:59:04.879 --> 00:59:05.813
- I was 15.

1152
00:59:12.686 --> 00:59:14.021
You were my brother.

1153
00:59:47.288 --> 00:59:48.856
Wait, wait, wait.

1154
01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:52.987
Thank you.

1155
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.023
- I knew something wasn't right.

1156
01:00:56.056 --> 01:00:56.924
- Guys.

1157
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:04.732
- I've been following you
guys since the bridge.

1158
01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.300
- Did you call for help?

1159
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.035
- I don't have a sat.

1160
01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:09.970
Nearest visit is as soon
as a day's hike from here.

1161
01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:11.405
It was getting dark, so I
thought I--

1162
01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:27.254
- Stupid piece of shit!

1163
01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:30.057
- Fucking you!

1164
01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:31.959
- You hero.

1165
01:01:38.533 --> 01:01:40.334
- Did you do that?

1166
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.468
Did you call for help?

1167
01:01:41.502 --> 01:01:42.469
- No Trevor, she didn't.

1168
01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:43.304
He just showed up.

1169
01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.939
He was just a hiker and showed
up.

1170
01:01:44.972 --> 01:01:45.472
It's over.

1171
01:01:45.507 --> 01:01:46.340
No, no.

1172
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:47.241
Trevor, don't do this.

1173
01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.175
Trevor!

1174
01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:49.076
Listen to me.

1175
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.977
The beast.

1176
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:50.778
You need us.

1177
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:51.812
You're not doing the beast
alone.

1178
01:01:51.845 --> 01:01:52.514
You can't, right?

1179
01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.414
You need us.

1180
01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:55.316
You need hostages in case goes
sideways.

1181
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:56.183
Right?

1182
01:01:57.318 --> 01:01:59.453
I'm still in this with you.

1183
01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:01.222
Please, please don't.

1184
01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:09.230
- Fucking please don't.

1185
01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:32.019
It's okay.

1186
01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.154
- I know.

1187
01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:35.022
- It's all right.

1188
01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.023
- I know.

1189
01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:36.890
Yeah.

1190
01:02:39.893 --> 01:02:41.028
- Gotta bury another body.

1191
01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:44.898
- I know.

1192
01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:46.900
I know, man.

1193
01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.338
- You flip us, they drown.

1194
01:03:58.506 --> 01:03:59.373
So.

1195
01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:49.390
- We gotta untie them.

1196
01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:52.292
- Can't.

1197
01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:53.427
- We're gonna flip.

1198
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.063
Last time I did the Beast
with four pros we ate shit.

1199
01:04:56.096 --> 01:04:56.997
One got a concussion.

1200
01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:57.931
- You know he lived.

1201
01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.400
- Barely, all right.

1202
01:04:59.433 --> 01:05:01.135
It was stupid luck.

1203
01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:02.236
We caught the right current.

1204
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:04.204
If you don't get to the
shore after the third drop

1205
01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:05.707
you go straight over the falls.

1206
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.207
Instant death, lights out!

1207
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:08.976
- Hey, hey!

1208
01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:10.545
You're Gray Reese,
you've known this river.

1209
01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:11.378
Come on now!

1210
01:05:11.412 --> 01:05:13.013
- Trevor, please, I'm begging
you.

1211
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:14.181
I'm begging you.

1212
01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:14.883
Let them go.

1213
01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:16.083
You have to let them go, okay?

1214
01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:17.317
Don't make this worse.

1215
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.620
If anything, it'll lighten the
boat.

1216
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:19.554
You and I working together,

1217
01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.155
we have a better shot anyway!

1218
01:05:23.691 --> 01:05:25.092
- I need hostages.

1219
01:05:25.993 --> 01:05:26.960
Like you said.

1220
01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:31.198
- Trevor, it's Joey.

1221
01:05:37.572 --> 01:05:38.472
I'm begging you.

1222
01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.077
Let them go.

1223
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.354
- Just do your best.

1224
01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:08.101
- Whatever happens,

1225
01:06:09.637 --> 01:06:11.038
I hope you die first.

1226
01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:47.407
- Are we leaking?

1227
01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:52.514
Did you do that?

1228
01:06:53.548 --> 01:06:54.414
Did you?!

1229
01:06:58.786 --> 01:07:00.087
Are you lying to me?

1230
01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:02.557
- No.

1231
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.591
- Don't you lie to me.

1232
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.664
Find a takeout.

1233
01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:10.532
We need to patch it.

1234
01:07:27.447 --> 01:07:28.348
Let's go, patch kit.

1235
01:07:28.382 --> 01:07:29.249
Do it quick.

1236
01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:39.794
It in there?

1237
01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:40.628
- Yeah.

1238
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:43.297
- Well c'mon, let's go.

1239
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.165
We gotta cross the Beast
before they find Walter-

1240
01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:49.102
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1241
01:07:54.174 --> 01:07:54.776
Come on, come on, come on!

1242
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:55.643
Open it!

1243
01:08:11.358 --> 01:08:11.859
Go!

1244
01:08:11.893 --> 01:08:12.794
Yes, yes!

1245
01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:13.661
You got it, you got it!

1246
01:08:13.695 --> 01:08:14.428
C'mon, c'mon!

1247
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:18.198
Go!

1248
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.466
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

1249
01:08:32.446 --> 01:08:33.280
Okay!

1250
01:09:17.825 --> 01:09:18.826
Okay!

1251
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.894
- You're gonna need to
get ready to run, okay?

1252
01:09:19.927 --> 01:09:20.728
Don't look back.

1253
01:09:20.762 --> 01:09:22.429
Just keep running as hard as you
can.

1254
01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:34.542
I got it, I got it!

1255
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:38.278
Go, go, go, go, go!

1256
01:10:14.882 --> 01:10:15.783
Go, go, go!

1257
01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:28.462
No, no!

1258
01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:28.996
Get up!

1259
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.263
Get up!

1260
01:10:30.297 --> 01:10:30.998
We gotta keep moving.

1261
01:10:31.032 --> 01:10:31.866
Don't stop 'till you get home.

1262
01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:32.567
- No, no, what about you?

1263
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.267
- I have to go back for Gray!

1264
01:10:34.301 --> 01:10:34.969
- No, he's gonna kill you!

1265
01:10:35.002 --> 01:10:35.970
- Both of us!
- No Joey!

1266
01:10:36.003 --> 01:10:37.038
We have to go-

1267
01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:38.806
- Go!

1268
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.674
Run, run!

1269
01:11:35.696 --> 01:11:36.631
Gray!

1270
01:11:36.664 --> 01:11:37.497
Gray!

1271
01:11:39.834 --> 01:11:40.668
Gray, I'm here, I'm here!

1272
01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:42.069
- Joey, okay.

1273
01:11:42.103 --> 01:11:43.037
- Let me see it.

1274
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.905
- I can't.
- Let me see it!

1275
01:11:43.938 --> 01:11:44.872
I have to see it!

1276
01:11:47.608 --> 01:11:48.109
It's okay.

1277
01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:48.976
It's okay.

1278
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.911
Hold it.

1279
01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:50.778
Pressure, okay?

1280
01:11:50.812 --> 01:11:51.746
Listen to me.

1281
01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:52.345
- I can't make it.

1282
01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:53.247
- Look at me, look at me.

1283
01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:54.582
Gray, we're gonna have to move,
okay?

1284
01:11:54.615 --> 01:11:55.116
- I can't.

1285
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:56.117
- Come on!

1286
01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:57.685
I'm gonna lift you!

1287
01:11:57.718 --> 01:11:58.418
1, 2, 3, go!

1288
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.087
Try! Please!

1289
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:01.122
We need to move!

1290
01:12:01.155 --> 01:12:02.056
Come on!

1291
01:12:03.591 --> 01:12:05.526
Stop being a little bitch!

1292
01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:07.862
1, 2.

1293
01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:09.964
3!

1294
01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:12.700
Come on!

1295
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:13.568
We're gonna make it!

1296
01:12:13.601 --> 01:12:14.669
Come on.

1297
01:12:14.702 --> 01:12:15.837
Come on!

1298
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:16.737
No!

1299
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:17.839
Come on, move!

1300
01:12:22.643 --> 01:12:23.711
Go!

1301
01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.726
- All right.

1302
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:14.929
- Hey!

1303
01:13:15.963 --> 01:13:16.797
Hey!

1304
01:13:17.932 --> 01:13:18.799
Hold up!

1305
01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:24.672
- You need help?

1306
01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:26.641
- Yeah!

1307
01:13:29.543 --> 01:13:30.111
- You gotta keep pressure on
that.

1308
01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.212
- I know.

1309
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:38.819
- Okay.

1310
01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:40.187
You're gonna make it.

1311
01:13:40.221 --> 01:13:41.956
- You gotta pull this off.

1312
01:13:41.989 --> 01:13:42.757
And do what?

1313
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:43.524
Run?

1314
01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:44.558
He'll catch us.

1315
01:13:44.592 --> 01:13:45.693
- He just wants
to get past the border.

1316
01:13:45.726 --> 01:13:48.195
- And he knows if we make
it there first he's screwed.

1317
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:49.563
Gotta keep pressure on it.

1318
01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:52.033
- Ah!

1319
01:13:56.237 --> 01:13:58.072
If we keep going, we'll die.

1320
01:13:58.105 --> 01:13:59.573
Helmets or not.

1321
01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:02.810
- You said that there's
shore before the falls.

1322
01:14:04.612 --> 01:14:06.247
- You don't know how.

1323
01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.581
- You're gonna tell me.

1324
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.074
- In the first side of
the middle!

1325
01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:07.942
Nice and easy!

1326
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.310
- Okay.

1327
01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:10.544
Hold on!

1328
01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:15.149
Hold on!

1329
01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:20.087
Stay with me!

1330
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:28.863
- You gotta cut left hard.

1331
01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:30.765
You gotta get to the far left!

1332
01:15:30.798 --> 01:15:31.465
- Copy!

1333
01:15:31.499 --> 01:15:32.333
- Otherwise we won't make it.

1334
01:15:32.366 --> 01:15:34.035
We'll be headed right for the
falls.

1335
01:15:35.069 --> 01:15:35.936
- Okay!

1336
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:37.605
Here we go!

1337
01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:40.007
- Go lateral, Joey.

1338
01:15:40.041 --> 01:15:40.841
- Hang on!

1339
01:15:44.078 --> 01:15:45.112
Shit.

1340
01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:46.680
- Joey, lateral!

1341
01:15:52.953 --> 01:15:54.321
- Hold on!

1342
01:15:54.355 --> 01:15:55.556
Gray!

1343
01:16:00.628 --> 01:16:01.829
Gray, hold on!

1344
01:16:12.706 --> 01:16:14.942
Okay, okay, we're okay.

1345
01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:15.843
Oh shit!

1346
01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:30.891
Gray!

1347
01:16:34.895 --> 01:16:35.729
Gray!

1348
01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:39.733
Gray!

1349
01:16:54.148 --> 01:16:55.015
Gray!

1350
01:16:57.318 --> 01:16:58.719
- Joey!

1351
01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:10.131
- Gray!

1352
01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:14.902
Gray!

1353
01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:26.881
- Joey!

1354
01:17:28.349 --> 01:17:29.183
- Gray!

1355
01:17:32.253 --> 01:17:33.087
Reach!

1356
01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:35.456
Reach me!

1357
01:17:35.489 --> 01:17:36.690
Reach it!

1358
01:17:38.192 --> 01:17:39.193
Grab my hand!

1359
01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.265
Take it!

1360
01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:45.132
Take it!

1361
01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:00.381
Yes!

1362
01:18:00.414 --> 01:18:01.315
Pull!

1363
01:18:11.091 --> 01:18:11.759
Come on!

1364
01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:14.929
Come on, we have to keep moving!

1365
01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:15.863
Come on!

1366
01:18:15.896 --> 01:18:16.397
Up!

1367
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:17.331
Gray!

1368
01:18:17.364 --> 01:18:18.232
1, 2!

1369
01:18:20.535 --> 01:18:23.204
Come on, we gotta move!

1370
01:18:23.237 --> 01:18:24.405
Gray!

1371
01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:25.306
Keep going!

1372
01:18:34.315 --> 01:18:35.416
C'mon you got it.

1373
01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:36.817
Keep moving, keep moving!

1374
01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:38.352
Keep moving!

1375
01:18:38.385 --> 01:18:39.453
Keep moving!

1376
01:18:39.486 --> 01:18:40.988
Gray, Gray!

1377
01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:41.523
Get up!

1378
01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:42.423
Get up!

1379
01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:44.124
No, no, no!

1380
01:18:44.158 --> 01:18:45.025
Look at me.

1381
01:18:45.059 --> 01:18:46.093
Look at me.

1382
01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:46.994
Look at me.

1383
01:18:47.027 --> 01:18:47.696
Gray, Gray.

1384
01:18:47.728 --> 01:18:48.362
We have to keep moving, okay?

1385
01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:49.797
You're gonna make it, okay?

1386
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:50.464
Just stay with me.

1387
01:18:50.497 --> 01:18:51.865
Stay with me.

1388
01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:53.167
You're gonna be okay.

1389
01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:53.867
You're not gonna die.

1390
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:55.236
You're not gonna die, I promise.

1391
01:18:55.269 --> 01:18:56.136
Okay?

1392
01:18:58.239 --> 01:18:59.073
Ah!

1393
01:19:28.202 --> 01:19:29.036
Oh, no!

1394
01:19:31.472 --> 01:19:32.306
- Ooh.

1395
01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.908
Now you fight?

1396
01:19:50.324 --> 01:19:51.191
- No!

1397
01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:58.365
- Now you fight.

1398
01:21:38.432 --> 01:21:43.103
- That
storm's almost on top of us.

1399
01:21:44.271 --> 01:21:45.038
- One more
time around

1400
01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:46.039
then let's move on.

1401
01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:40.420
- All right,
let's head back up river.

1402
01:24:23.598 --> 01:24:24.666
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1403
01:24:24.699 --> 01:24:25.499
She's here, she's here!

1404
01:24:25.533 --> 01:24:26.366
Wait!

1405
01:25:15.783 --> 01:25:18.218
- Dr. Reese!

1406
01:25:18.251 --> 01:25:21.288
Dr. Reese, we're taking
you to Indian Springs.

1407
01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:23.223
Is there anyone that we should
call?

1408
01:25:23.256 --> 01:25:25.292
Is there anyone you wanna
have meet you there?
