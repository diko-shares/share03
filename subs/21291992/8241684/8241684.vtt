00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:05.138
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:29.062
(foreboding music)

3
00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.032
(object tapping)

4
00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.458
(waterfall crashing)

5
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.368
(wind rushing)

6
00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:11.573
- [Man] I thought you
were coming back Sunday.

7
00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.340
- [Joey] No, Tuesday.

8
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.207
- [Man] Oh.

9
00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.210
Okay.

10
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.082
Well, I'm glad you're finally
doing this.

11
00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:24.351
- It'll be fun.

12
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.589
Nice change of pace.

13
00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.823
- For sure.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.190
- [Man] And we can just-

15
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.626
We'll look at houses next week.

16
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.565
Jo?

17
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.432
- Yeah.

18
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.203
- [Man] Anyway, I hope
your brother's doing good.

19
00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.507
And remember, if you hear
a banjo playing, run.

20
00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.410
Have a great time.

21
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.244
Call me when you're
back on the grid, okay?

22
00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:52.847
- Okay, yeah, thank you.

23
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.147
- Be safe.
- All right, bye.

24
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.182
- [Man] Bye.

25
00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.667

26
00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.373

(people chattering)

40
00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.379
- [Gray] If I'm floating in the
water,

41
00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:35.248
keep my feet downstream,
gently bend my knees.

42
00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.584
You'll be floating on your back.

43
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:37.985
Head tucked, knees gently bent.

44
00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.887
- Kiss your ass goodbye.

45
00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:40.955
- Oh, hey.

46
00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.456
She made it.

47
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.391
Hi, kid.
- Sorry I'm late.

48
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.459
- Yeah, that's all right.

49
00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.861
We almost left without you.

50
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:47.862
- I would've chased you down.

51
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.597
- I bet you would've.

52
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.497
- Yeah.

53
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:52.934
You look good.

54
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.334
- Thank you, I feel good.

55
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.402
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.740
Oh, this is my kid, sis, Joey.

57
00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.340
This is Karissa and Van.

58
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.475
They're actually paying to be
here,

59
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:02.442
unlike some free loaders.

60
00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.111
- I tried to pay.

61
00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:04.078
- She didn't try that hard.

62
00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:05.513
- So what, are we
crashing a family holiday?

63
00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:06.748
- No, no, no, no, not at all.

64
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.549
If anything, she's
crashing my place of work.

65
00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.383
- So I bet Trevor's like your
brother

66
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.284
or something, then is he?

67
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.954
- Well, basically, yeah.

68
00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:14.354
- Trevor?

69
00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:15.022
- Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:15.990
A little surprise.

71
00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:17.859
He was supposed to be off today,

72
00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.494
but heard you were coming
and wanted to join the trip.

73
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:24.031
So, if you could just get
his head out of his ass.

74
00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.333
(man whistling)

75
00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.201
- [Joey] Just like old times,
then.

76
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.704
- [Gray] Yeah, just like Snake
River.

77
00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.507
You need help with your gear?

78
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.041
- No.
- All right.

79
00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:34.876
- Boat's down there.
- I'll be right back.

80
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:35.777
Okay.
- Great.

81
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.677
Chop chop, 'cause...

82
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.045
Thank you.

83
00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.647
Let's get you girls sized up.

84
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.753
(lid closing)

85
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.694
- [Trevor] Holy shit.

86
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.530
Not on my river.

87
00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:59.534
- Hey.
- Hey!

88
00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:03.538
- Holy shit, good to see you.
- You, too.

89
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:06.541
- Holy shit, been a minute.

90
00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:07.307
- Yeah.

91
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.341
Yeah, it's been forever.
- Yeah.

92
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.442
How you been?

93
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:11.279
- Yeah, good.

94
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.680
Really good.
- Yeah?

95
00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:13.413
- Yeah.

96
00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.081
I hear great things.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:16.083
- I hear good, good things.

98
00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:17.952
Let me ask you a question.

99
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.687
How many lives you saved this
week?

100
00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:23.825
Come on.

101
00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:24.859
- Yeah, I mean, I don't
know, two or three.

102
00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:26.060
- Two or three!

103
00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.061
Just two or three.

104
00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.563
No big deal.

105
00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.031
Holy shit.

106
00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:31.065
Gray told me you're coming.

107
00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.100
It was supposed to be my
weekend off and I said,

108
00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.602
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

109
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.469
I'll be on the boat with Jo
Bean.

110
00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:37.939
We got a lot to catch up on.

111
00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:38.840
- Yeah.

112
00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:39.974
Thank you very much.

113
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.441
How have you been?

114
00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:42.810
- Me?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:43.711
- Pretty good.

116
00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.079
Pretty good, yeah.

117
00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:47.447
You know, not in prison anymore.

118
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.516
- I did notice.

119
00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:49.283
- You noticed?
- Yeah.

120
00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:50.751
- Great.
- When'd that happened?

121
00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:53.588
- Yeah, a little after
Christmas.

122
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.990
And um, yeah, pretty good, you
know?

123
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:58.726
Gray hooked me up with the job.

124
00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.127
I'm loving this.

125
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.529
On the river every day.

126
00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.130
Getting paid to paddle.

127
00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.632
It's pretty great.

128
00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:09.837
(people chattering)

129
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.515
- I remember how.

130
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:22.984
- Except you never did it
right in the first place.

131
00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:23.885
- This isn't right?

132
00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:25.152
- No, your fold's up.

133
00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.654
- I'm a triple folder, bro.

134
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.155
- If the fold's up, it's gonna
leak.

135
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.090
Let me-
- If the fold is up-

136
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:30.024
- Can I just show you how?

137
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.559
- Aw, there it is, it's clicked.

138
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:32.793
- [Gray] I hope everything gets
wet.

139
00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:33.728
- [Joey] Hey, Gray?

140
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:34.629
- [Gray] You can freeze for two
nights.

141
00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:36.864
- [Joey] Can I show you this for
a second?

142
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:38.032
(distant music)

143
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.499
- Is he still texting you?

144
00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.433
- No, he's just asking-
- Give it to me.

145
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.936
- No, it's fine.
- It's going in the river.

146
00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.537
No, it's going in the river.
- It's not fair!

147
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.606
(women arguing)

148
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.808
- Jo Bean, you gotta
sign the safety waiver.

149
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.844
- Do I?

150
00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.913
(people chattering)

151
00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:52.880
Oh, what is this?

152
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.949
Arbitration.

153
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.218
- Give it to me!
- Get off me.

154
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.786
- You are being-

155
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.554
Oh, my God.

156
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.757
- Can you please hurry up and
sign it so I can murder you

157
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.958
without getting in trouble?

158
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:06.961
(Joey laughing)

159
00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:07.895
- [Joey] Well, now you
can finally get rid of me.

160
00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:08.796
- Geez.

161
00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:10.197
Gimme that, gee.

162
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:11.532
Girls, hey, girls, girls!

163
00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:12.333
We should load up.

164
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.234
We're burning daylight.
- Okay.

165
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.568
- It's time to float.

166
00:07:15.503 --> 00:07:18.005
(upbeat music)

167
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:35.690
- [Karissa] Well, I did when
I was in Austria with my dad.

168
00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:39.260
- [Trevor] And she doesn't
know a classic city in America.

169
00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.761
- [Gray] Boise's the state
capital.

170
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:42.063
It's about nine hours south of
here.

171
00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:42.897
- [Karissa] Oh, cool.

172
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.965
- [Trevor] Where are you all
from?

173
00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:44.966
- We both live in London.

174
00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:46.100
- Yeah, but I'm from Dublin.

175
00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:46.968
- [Trevor] Oh.

176
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.704
That's Lucky Charms, right?
- What?

177
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:52.873
- [Trevor] That's the
Lucky Charms capital.

178
00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:53.741
- Doesn't make no sense.

179
00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.009
I don't know what you're talking
about.

180
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:56.043
- It doesn't make any sense?

181
00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:57.011
You're from Dublin, you
don't know Lucky Charms?

182
00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:57.912
- I'm sorry, should I know a
lucky charms?

183
00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.247
- She's never heard that joke
before.

184
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:01.115
- Trevor, you're better than
this.

185
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:01.949
- It's the first time!

186
00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.718
- You mean the leprechaun?
- Yeah!

187
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:04.652
- Oh, my God the leprechaun?

188
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.253
- Okay, see, she knows the
leprechaun.

189
00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:07.588
- [Gray] Forgive Trevor.

190
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:09.523
He's lived a very sheltered
life.

191
00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:11.525
- I grew up in a grocery store.

192
00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:12.793
(all chuckling)

193
00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:13.995
- Is this your first time in the
States?

194
00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:15.596
- No, actually, Van and I,

195
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:17.131
we stopped through Puerto Rico
once.

196
00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:18.265
- Yeah.

197
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.568
- And I went to New York with my
husband.

198
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.736
- And I think that was the last
time

199
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.304
he let you out of the house.

200
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:24.205
- Oh, come on.

201
00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.306
- They're our friends now, we
can vent!

202
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.575
- It's not worth the oxygen
is that conversation.

203
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.577
- You know I had to jail break
her ass?

204
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.846
- Oh, stop it.
- Yes, I did!

205
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.714
I had to drag you out by your
hair, bitch.

206
00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:35.282
- Does he know you're gone?

207
00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.751
Did you leave pillows under the
blanket?

208
00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:39.253
Did you Ferris Bueller his ass?

209
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.055
(men laughing)

210
00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:42.656
- [Gray] Trevor and I
Ferris Buellered our way

211
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.091
through high school.

212
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:44.959
(Gray laughing)

213
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:45.826
- Oh.

214
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.030
I hear Ogden pass.
- Mhm.

215
00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:49.864
- What's Ogden pass?

216
00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.799
- [Gray] That is our first
rapids.

217
00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.601
- [Trevor] Only a class two,
though.

218
00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.202
- No, not after yesterday's
rain.

219
00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:56.137
- Oh my God, man.

220
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.171
Ogden never surges.

221
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.173
- [Gray] I'm telling you,
storm broke those banks.

222
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.174
Trust me.

223
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.108
- Trust me.

224
00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:02.176
I'll bet you dinner at Lupe's.

225
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.210
- Dinner at Lupe's?
- Yeah.

226
00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:04.779
Storm didn't break shit.
- Oh, Mr .Deep Pockets.

227
00:09:04.812 --> 00:09:05.980
You got yourself a deal.

228
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:09.016
- I got myself a meal.

229
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.918
(Gray laughing)

230
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:13.921
(upbeat music)

231
00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:18.559
- [Gray] Here we go!
(all screaming)

232
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:23.064
Left side, left side!

233
00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:25.966
(water crashing)

234
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.069
(all cheering)

235
00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:28.969
- [Gray] Come on, Jo Bean!

236
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:32.073
Paying customers are doing all
the work.

237
00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:33.908
- [Karissa] Oh my God!

238
00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.578
- You good?
- Oh my God, no!

239
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.948
- [Gray] Look at her go!

240
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.651
(all cheering)

241
00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:46.987
(Gray laughing)

242
00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:52.960
Here comes the big one!
- Here we go!

243
00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:56.063
(all cheering)

244
00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:58.866
(water bubbling)

245
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.236
(Joey gasping)

246
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.871
(all cheering)

247
00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:05.106
Swimmer!

248
00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:07.775
(all yelling)

249
00:10:10.678 --> 00:10:13.147
(gentle music)

250
00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.954
(water crashing)
(all cheering)

251
00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.956
- Oh my god, it's so much
colder!

252
00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:24.792
(water splashing)

253
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.237
- [Trevor] Want some?

254
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.705
- No, I'm good, thank you.

255
00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.011
- You all right?

256
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:47.081
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.949
- What's not to be all right
about?

258
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:50.918
You know?

259
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:51.520
- [Gray] You both don't have to
do it,

260
00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:52.820
we can climb back down.

261
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.657
- Sorry about that dip you took.

262
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.431
- [Karissa] Do you guys wanna go
first?

263
00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:06.200
- [Joey] No, no way, I just got
dry.

264
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:09.069
- [Karissa] Trevor?

265
00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:10.371
- No thanks.

266
00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:12.039
- [Gray] Because he's afraid of
heights.

267
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.174
- Bull shit!

268
00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:14.742
- True shit.

269
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:15.709
His whole life.

270
00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:16.844
Joey, our tree house.

271
00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:18.779
Did Trevor ever come up?

272
00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.182
Or did he stay on the ground
scared because he had to-

273
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:21.916
What did you have to do?

274
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:23.417
- I was securing the perimeter.

275
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.753
(Gray laughing)

276
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:26.754
You were scared of dogs.

277
00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:29.223
- Well, you stay there
and secure the perimeter

278
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.991
as an adult man who's
not afraid of heights.

279
00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:33.093
- Let me go up there
and secure your asshole.

280
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:33.662
- God, here he comes.

281
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:34.461
Now we gotta jump, okay?

282
00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.696
3, 2, 1!

283
00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:39.833
(lighthearted music)

284
00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:44.772
- [Trevor] Get back up here!

285
00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:46.874
I'm not afraid to swim.

286
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:03.757
- [Van] I mean, also just use
your brain.

287
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.858
- [Trevor] Nope.

288
00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:05.893
- [Van] Yeah, we'll take help.

289
00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:07.928
- [Trevor] I'm just gonna start-

290
00:12:07.962 --> 00:12:10.297
- Okay.
- Poking this in here.

291
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.267
See what that does for you.

292
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.302
That, you want this tension.

293
00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:16.971
It's good.

294
00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:17.972
- [Karissa] Yeah, so you
go that way and then-

295
00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:21.408
- [Joey] You gotta start over.
(logs falling)

296
00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:22.544
- For this?

297
00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:24.478
For this, you called and
said, I wanna come visit you?

298
00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.247
To play a little bitch game?

299
00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:28.282
- Yeah.

300
00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.117
I missed a little bitch game.

301
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.387
- [Gray] Well, you just
nominated
yourself as fire starter.

302
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.421
- [Trevor] There we go, in no
time.

303
00:12:34.455 --> 00:12:36.490
All right, who wants to
do the cherry on top?

304
00:12:36.524 --> 00:12:38.058
- Me.
- Tie a little bow.

305
00:12:38.092 --> 00:12:41.061
(tent unzipping)

306
00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:41.929
Let me help you.

307
00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:55.843
(clothes rustling)

308
00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.244
Pull on the hole.

309
00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.280
It's an important job.

310
00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:00.914
It's the best part.

311
00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:03.150
(knife scraping)

312
00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.020
- [Karissa] Hey, where is
the best place for me to-

313
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:06.987
I mean, where should I-

314
00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:08.422
- [Van] She has to take a piss.

315
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.325
Well, you do.
- Come on.

316
00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:12.860
- Anywhere you like.

317
00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.262
Pick your favorite tree and cop
a lean.

318
00:13:15.296 --> 00:13:16.130
- Okay.

319
00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:20.568
Are there animals around?

320
00:13:20.602 --> 00:13:23.437
- Yeah, there's certainly
animals out here.

321
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.305
- Okay.

322
00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:26.073
- Lots, but they're not gonna
bug you.

323
00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.909
Here, if it makes you feel
better.

324
00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:33.847
- You want this?

325
00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:36.350
- No, thank you.

326
00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:37.552
Looks great, though.
- Sharp.

327
00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:38.319
- [Karissa] Yeah.

328
00:13:38.352 --> 00:13:39.953
- All right.
- Looks dangerous.

329
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.221
- This is bear mace.

330
00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:42.156
You won't need it,

331
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:44.925
but that's the safety, squeeze
it on top.

332
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.460
Make sure you don't point it at
your face.

333
00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.295
- Uh, terrifying.
(Gray laughing)

334
00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:49.196
Thank you.

335
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.164
- Yeah, you got it.

336
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:50.831
- Okay.

337
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.201
- Holler if you need anything.

338
00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:57.237
- [Karissa] I probably will
scream.

339
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:00.474
- I can feel you looking at me.

340
00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:02.544
- "Holler if you need anything."

341
00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:03.477
(Gray laughing)

342
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:04.646
What's going on with that bulge?

343
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.480
I see it.
- Shut up, man.

344
00:14:06.514 --> 00:14:07.649
- Oh, Gray.
- Use your bulge.

345
00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:09.249
- Give me that tea, Gray.
- Use your bulge.

346
00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:10.618
- Give me that tea.

347
00:14:10.652 --> 00:14:14.421
- Hey, um, do you guys
want some or, I mean,

348
00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:16.390
is it okay that I brought this?

349
00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:18.992
- No.
- No?

350
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:19.594
- [Trevor] You're in trouble.

351
00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:20.528
- [Van] I'm in trouble?

352
00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:21.495
- [Trevor] Come on down here to
the fire.

353
00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.263
We have to have a team meeting
about this.

354
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.164
- Oh, okay.

355
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:24.865
If I have to.

356
00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:27.201
- [Trevor] What are we gonna do?

357
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.169
- Okay, so it's like four
o'clock in the morning I think,

358
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:31.271
and we've been out since like
eight, okay.

359
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.207
And Care bear goes up to her and
she goes,

360
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.410
"I'll give you five
American dollars for a-"

361
00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:37.411
- [Karissa] I'm sorry, is
that supposed to be me?

362
00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.046
- That sounds exactly like you.

363
00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:40.047
That's how she sounds.

364
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.182
And she's drunk as well,
so keep that in mind.

365
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.917
And she goes, and this girl
goes,

366
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:46.053
"American Dollar?

367
00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.122
What you mean American Dollar?"

368
00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:49.657
And you should have seen-

369
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:51.158
- Hold up, I don't get it.

370
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.293
Why'd she, why was the
American dollar thing?

371
00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:54.529
Why was that funny?

372
00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:55.630
- They're in America!

373
00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.699
- [Karissa] I was so drunk
and I maybe forgot that

374
00:14:57.732 --> 00:14:59.233
they use American dollars in
Puerto Rico.

375
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.001
- They use American
dollars in Puerto Rico.

376
00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:01.902
(all giggling)

377
00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:03.203
- So wait, did you get your
cigarette?

378
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:03.937
- No.

379
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:04.839
Shift the conversation, please.

380
00:15:04.873 --> 00:15:06.407
Joey, do you wanna tell us about
yourself?

381
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.642
Tell us something about you.

382
00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:09.476
- Uh...

383
00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.413
What do you wanna-

384
00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:13.581
what do you wanna know?

385
00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:15.282
- Are you married, are you
married?

386
00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:16.150
(Gray scoffing)

387
00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:16.684
- Whoa.

388
00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:17.519
No.

389
00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:18.686
I don't know why that's funny,
but-

390
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.053
- [Karissa] Boyfriend?

391
00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:23.223
- Yeah, sorta.

392
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:23.957
I don't know.

393
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:24.659
- I don't know.

394
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:25.627
What's that mean?

395
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.960
Be honest.

396
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:30.364
- I don't know.

397
00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.699
I mean, he's...

398
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:32.933
He's nice.

399
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.703
He's a nice guy.

400
00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:37.639
- How did you meet him?

401
00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:39.006
- We work together.

402
00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.174
- [Trevor] Mm, doctor.

403
00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.009
- [Gray] Oh, sexy doctor.

404
00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.343
- Is he a sexy doctor?

405
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:47.948
- I guess he's like-

406
00:15:48.683 --> 00:15:49.584
He's all right.

407
00:15:49.617 --> 00:15:53.053
He's like, you know, tall and-

408
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:55.590
He's like stupid tall, actually.

409
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:56.658
- [Trevor] Stupid tall, McStupid
Tall.

410
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:59.193
- Wow, he sounds awful.

411
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.595
- Yeah, it's tall doctor.

412
00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.530
Probably wants a family.

413
00:16:02.564 --> 00:16:04.097
Piece of shit.

414
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:05.265
Guy's like a monster.

415
00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:08.402
- [Van] Oh, hey, Gray.

416
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:10.003
You sure you didn't want any?

417
00:16:10.037 --> 00:16:11.104
- No, thank you.

418
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:12.707
- [Van] Oh, come on.

419
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.775
You're off the clock.

420
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:16.376
And besides, we're all the
best friends now, right?

421
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.346
- A river guide is never off the
clock.

422
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:19.914
- Okay, come on.

423
00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:20.815
When people don't drink,

424
00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.650
that's actually when I get
suspicious.

425
00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:24.084
- You don't need to worry about
me.

426
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.353
It's this idiot you
should be suspicious of.

427
00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.055
(Karissa giggling)

428
00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:28.890
- Wait, no, no, okay.

429
00:16:28.923 --> 00:16:30.424
So like, look, we can toast,
right?

430
00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:33.728
One toast to our first
day of not drowning.

431
00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:34.629
I didn't drown.

432
00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:35.730
- You know what?

433
00:16:35.763 --> 00:16:37.164
You do a toast for me.

434
00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.533
- Oh, please, just one.

435
00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:39.801
- You do a toast for me.

436
00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.368
- Come on.

437
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:43.103
- Please, just one toast.
- All very good points, but-

438
00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.171
- He's sober.

439
00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:48.175
(fire crackling)

440
00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:51.646
- Well, that's amazing.

441
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:52.547
Good for you.

442
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.516
- It's nothing, you know.

443
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.758
- On that note, I'm gonna hit
the hay.

444
00:17:03.791 --> 00:17:04.692
It's been fun.

445
00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:05.660
Thank you for a great day.

446
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:07.060
And I'll see everyone in the-

447
00:17:07.094 --> 00:17:07.829
(all protesting)

448
00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:08.630
I'm racked.

449
00:17:08.663 --> 00:17:10.464
I've been up for almost 24
hours.

450
00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:12.767
But thank you very much,
it's been a great day.

451
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.668
Enjoy your night.

452
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:15.202
I'll see you in the morning.

453
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:16.771
- [Karissa] We'll miss you.

454
00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:18.438
- Good night, Joey.

455
00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:21.241
(tent unzipping)

456
00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:33.253
(tent zipping)
(people chattering)

457
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:38.860
- Fill her up.

458
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.460
Fill her up.

459
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:41.461
- Very cool.

460
00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.262
- Thank you.

461
00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:44.298
That's what these are really
for.

462
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.133
You don't need to be getting up.

463
00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:49.369
(Karissa coughing)

464
00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:50.572
- [Gray] Yeah, hey Karissa.

465
00:17:50.605 --> 00:17:51.806
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

466
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.308
the wind's pushing the smoke
like right in your direction.

467
00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:56.109
You might be better off
if you move to the side.

468
00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.377
- That's a good idea.

469
00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.479
- Karissa, he wants you
to come all the way over

470
00:17:59.514 --> 00:18:01.849
to where it's nice and safe by
him.

471
00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:04.184
Just right next to him.

472
00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:05.720
Give him a sloppy wet kiss.

473
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:06.721
- Oh my God.

474
00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:08.422
- [Trevor] Just give him a kiss.

475
00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:10.290
- On behalf of Kootenai River
Adventures,

476
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:13.160
I would like to apologize
for any inappropriate

477
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.195
and offensive comments made.

478
00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:16.396
- They're buying it.

479
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.732
They're buying it, you're good.

480
00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:18.900
You're covered.

481
00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:21.536
- Okay, well I gotta go visit a
tree.

482
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:22.704
- Oh, okay, be careful.

483
00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:23.705
You should go that way.

484
00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:24.572
- This way?
- Yeah.

485
00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:26.373
I went over there and I nearly
died.

486
00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.142
There's a full on cliff,
seriously.

487
00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:30.678
- [Van] Right, okay.

488
00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:38.218
- [Karissa] She should
have taken the bear mace.

489
00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:41.121
(Gray groaning)

490
00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:46.126
- I think I'm gonna do the same
thing.

491
00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:48.395
You should just-

492
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.231
Get outta the smoke.

493
00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:01.441
(Karissa coughing)

494
00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.309
- I think Trevor-
- Yeah, yeah.

495
00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:04.779
It sort of followed you, didn't
it?

496
00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:06.614
It's like drawn to you.

497
00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:07.280
- You're so right.

498
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.182
Save me from Trevor's curse.

499
00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.752
I think he cursed me.

500
00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.654
Oh, okay.

501
00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:14.656
It's nice down here.

502
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:15.523
- Mhm.

503
00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:24.431
(distant chattering)

504
00:19:35.877 --> 00:19:38.680
(text whooshing)

505
00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:48.990
- Oh, I mean, work.

506
00:19:49.023 --> 00:19:49.824
- I know what you mean.

507
00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.826
I know what you mean.

508
00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:54.227
I worked for Kootenai probably

509
00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.597
a little over three years, now.

510
00:19:57.598 --> 00:19:59.834
But it's not work.

511
00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:03.671
Just, it's what I love.

512
00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.840
- But you take it really
seriously, I can see that.

513
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:06.708
- Well, yeah.

514
00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:07.775
You have to, you know.

515
00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.746
And you, what's your thing?

516
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:14.515
- Well,

517
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.752
I was really into fashion.

518
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.920
- Ah.

519
00:20:18.953 --> 00:20:20.320
That's cool. That's cool.

520
00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:25.425
- Yeah, I studied at uni and I
loved it.

521
00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:29.030
And I just, I wanted to, you
know, go.

522
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:30.330
I wanted to go to New York.

523
00:20:30.363 --> 00:20:31.799
I wanted to design.

524
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.004
But then I got married

525
00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:40.608
and he doesn't want me to work.

526
00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.247
- [Gray] That's a bummer.

527
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.791
I dunno.

528
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:57.792
I'd go insane without work.

529
00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:02.063
(Gray distantly laughing)

530
00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:03.064
I'm serious.

531
00:21:03.097 --> 00:21:05.533
This job saved my life.

532
00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:08.536
They took me in, you know.

533
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.308
Let's just say I didn't have
the best support system.

534
00:21:17.078 --> 00:21:18.646
- [Karissa] Yeah, I get that.

535
00:21:19.714 --> 00:21:20.782
- [Gray] Yeah.

536
00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.049
- [Trevor] Gray!

537
00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.785
Guys, we need help here!

538
00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:25.418
- What was that?
- Shit.

539
00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.921
Trev, everything okay?

540
00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:28.723
- [Trevor] Hurry!

541
00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:29.389
- Gray?

542
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:32.660
- [Gray] Trev, where are you?

543
00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:33.360
- [Joey] Guys?

544
00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:34.829
- [Karissa] Wait, where's van?

545
00:21:34.862 --> 00:21:35.763
Van?

546
00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:36.697
- [Joey] Hey!

547
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.397
- [Trevor] Over here.

548
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.365
- [Gray] Van!

549
00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:39.033
- [Karissa] Van, where are you?

550
00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.935
- [Trevor] Over here.

551
00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.637
- What happened?
- Yeah, she fell.

552
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.404
- [Karissa] What happened, what
happened?

553
00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:45.540
- [Trevor] Don't get up,
don't get up, don't get up.

554
00:21:45.573 --> 00:21:47.008
Just chill, just hang on.

555
00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:48.075
Hang on, just stay there.

556
00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:49.409
- Don't touch me.

557
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:50.711
Don't-
- okay, all right.

558
00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:51.779
Wait, wait, wait.

559
00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:52.947
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Can you help me get up?

560
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.848
- Don't move.

561
00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:54.715
We need you to lay down.

562
00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:55.315
- I'm fine.

563
00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:56.217
- Okay?
- I'm fine.

564
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.885
- I'm gonna get you down on the
ground

565
00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:59.419
and lay you down flat, okay?

566
00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:00.087
- [Van] I just wanna get up.

567
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:00.955
- [Joey] What happened?

568
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:01.656
- [Trevor] She tripped.

569
00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:02.389
- [Van] It doesn't even hurt.

570
00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:03.691
- [Joey] Okay, no, that's okay.

571
00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:04.391
That's good.

572
00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:05.660
We're just gonna help you, okay?

573
00:22:05.693 --> 00:22:07.460
- [Trevor] Big ass rock right
here that she hit her head on.

574
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.830
- [Joey] No, no, no, it's okay,
it's okay.

575
00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:09.697
- It doesn't even hurt, okay.

576
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.665
- Hey Trev,

577
00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:11.999
why don't you go get
the first aid kit, yeah?

578
00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.568
It's in my bag.

579
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:14.602
- [Joey] Let me check your eyes.

580
00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:16.637
- Actually, grab the sat
phone, call ranger six.

581
00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:17.872
- We don't need to call anyone.

582
00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:20.741
- Go get some big sticks so
that I can stabilize her neck.

583
00:22:20.775 --> 00:22:21.976
Go, go.

584
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:22.944
Okay, look at me.

585
00:22:22.977 --> 00:22:24.712
Grab my hands.
- I doesn't even hurt, okay.

586
00:22:24.745 --> 00:22:26.514
- I want you to keep your eyes
open, okay?

587
00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:27.414
Take deep breaths.

588
00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:28.115
- I feel like I'm fine.

589
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.950
Honestly, we don't need-

590
00:22:28.983 --> 00:22:29.650
- I want you to wiggle your
fingers.

591
00:22:29.684 --> 00:22:31.118
Okay, can you lift your feet up?

592
00:22:31.152 --> 00:22:32.053
- [Van] Yeah.

593
00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:32.920
- Any numbness, tingling?

594
00:22:32.954 --> 00:22:33.788
- He grabbed me.

595
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:36.524
He grabbed me.

596
00:22:36.557 --> 00:22:37.725
Don't let him come back, please.

597
00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:38.726
- It's okay.

598
00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:39.694
Just stay with us.

599
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:41.562
- First aid kit.

600
00:22:42.563 --> 00:22:44.599
- How hard did she fall?

601
00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:46.100
- I don't know, not that hard.

602
00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:48.502
- Get up.
- Big ass rock.

603
00:22:48.536 --> 00:22:50.037
- Any of these work?

604
00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:50.805
- [Joey] I'm gonna put some
pressure-

605
00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.773
- Sat phone's dead, man.
- What?

606
00:22:52.807 --> 00:22:53.473
- Yeah, yeah.

607
00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:54.342
- [Van] It doesn't even hurt.

608
00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:55.309
- Did you swap bricks?
- Yes, always.

609
00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:57.511
- They're both dead.
- Dude, they never work.

610
00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:58.445
- [Joey] We need to get
her to the hospital.

611
00:22:58.478 --> 00:22:59.412
- Wait, she's fine, right?

612
00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:00.413
- I don't need to go
to the hospital, okay.

613
00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:01.816
I feel like I'm fine.

614
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:02.884
- How far is the road?

615
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:05.019
- There's no road out here.

616
00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:07.021
Ranger station six is closest to
help.

617
00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:08.022
- [Joey] How far?

618
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:09.489
- It's like half a day hike.

619
00:23:09.523 --> 00:23:10.825
But the river cuts straight
through.

620
00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:12.593
- How long? How long?

621
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:15.062
- With a fast current, two
hours.

622
00:23:15.096 --> 00:23:15.863
- In the dark?

623
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:16.764
- I don't think we have a
choice.

624
00:23:16.797 --> 00:23:19.901
- Listen, we might not have two
hours.

625
00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:21.569
She's got a skull fracture.

626
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:24.404
It's gonna start to swell.

627
00:23:28.142 --> 00:23:30.177
- You're fine, you're fine,
you're fine.

628
00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:31.545
- Please, you're my friend.

629
00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:32.580
Please just help me.

630
00:23:32.613 --> 00:23:33.581
They're freaking me out.

631
00:23:33.614 --> 00:23:34.949
- Is that the fastest way?

632
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:40.453
Gray!

633
00:23:42.857 --> 00:23:43.691
- By far.

634
00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:46.060
- Okay, go.

635
00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:47.161
Start packing up.
Essentials only.

636
00:23:47.194 --> 00:23:48.796
Go, move.

637
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.332
(intense music)

638
00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.605
- [Joey] Keep her straight.

639
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.876
- [Gray] Careful, careful.

640
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.511
First this way.

641
00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:05.246
- [Joey] Keep it even.
Keep it even, guys.

642
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.080
We're almost there.

643
00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:07.181
- [Gray] You got her?

644
00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:08.015
You got her.
Not too fast.

645
00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:09.583
- Keep her straight.
- Slow, slow.

646
00:24:09.617 --> 00:24:10.618
- [Joey] Alright, count of
three.

647
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:14.555
1, 2, 3, down.
(eerie music)

648
00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:15.790
There you go, easy, easy.

649
00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:16.624
Okay.

650
00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:17.490
All right, there you go.

651
00:24:17.525 --> 00:24:19.126
You're okay.

652
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.994
All right.

653
00:24:21.996 --> 00:24:24.865
(foreboding music)

654
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:30.004
(water splashing)

655
00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:36.476
- Hey!
- Hello?

656
00:24:37.812 --> 00:24:40.881
- Hello!
Anybody out there?

657
00:24:40.915 --> 00:24:42.249
- [Joey] We need help!

658
00:24:42.283 --> 00:24:44.218
- [Gray] Anybody hear us?

659
00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:45.786
- [Joey] Anybody?

660
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:50.591
- We had the only campsite in
this canyon.

661
00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:51.625
No one's out here.

662
00:24:53.594 --> 00:24:54.228
- Doesn't work, man.

663
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.629
- I'm just looking.

664
00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:56.697
- It didn't charge.

665
00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:57.365
- You were supposed to charge
it.

666
00:24:57.398 --> 00:24:57.932
- [Trevor] I did charge it.

667
00:24:57.965 --> 00:24:59.033
- Well, obviously not.

668
00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:01.836
- [Trevor] Bro, those kits
don't hold their juice.

669
00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:03.671
I told management about it like
10 times.

670
00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:06.607
- Will you guys just
shut up and man the boat?

671
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.075
- [Van] Cara? Cara?

672
00:25:09.243 --> 00:25:10.144
- Yeah, hey.

673
00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:11.312
Hey, I'm right here.

674
00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:12.646
Talk to me.

675
00:25:14.015 --> 00:25:14.815
- This is-

676
00:25:16.317 --> 00:25:18.019
This is just like at uni,
remember?

677
00:25:23.591 --> 00:25:26.027
When I dislocated my shoulder?

678
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.328
- Yeah.

679
00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:29.563
Well I told you not to get
on that board, didn't I?

680
00:25:29.597 --> 00:25:32.066
- Oh, can't back down from a
dare.

681
00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:33.534
- [Karissa] That's true.

682
00:25:34.235 --> 00:25:35.069
- Besides,

683
00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:43.344
I knew you'd take care of me.

684
00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:47.148
- Yeah, well, I always
take care of you, don't I?

685
00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:50.317
- And it was worth it for
those cheese toasties.

686
00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:52.219
(Van and Karissa laughing)

687
00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:53.320
- Well, okay.

688
00:25:53.354 --> 00:25:55.990
I promise you, we're gonna get
you home

689
00:25:56.023 --> 00:25:58.092
and I am gonna make you
all the cheese toasties

690
00:25:58.125 --> 00:25:59.160
that you can eat, okay?

691
00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:02.596
We'll just get you home.

692
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.065
We'll just get you home.

693
00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:04.965
- Wait,

694
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:07.835
are you burning?

695
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.137
- What?

696
00:26:11.205 --> 00:26:12.039
- Smells like...

697
00:26:14.308 --> 00:26:15.876
Smells like they're burning.

698
00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:19.680
(Van seizing)

699
00:26:19.713 --> 00:26:21.649
- Okay, okay, okay, Trevor, hold
her feet.

700
00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:22.950
- Oh my God, what's happening?

701
00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:23.552
Oh my God.

702
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:24.819
- She's having a seizure.

703
00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:25.820
Help us.

704
00:26:25.853 --> 00:26:28.155
Okay, we're gonna turn
her on her side, okay?

705
00:26:28.189 --> 00:26:29.223
- Is she dying?
- No, no, no.

706
00:26:29.256 --> 00:26:30.357
- [Karissa] Van? Van?

707
00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:33.094
- Gently now, hold her head.
- Uh-huh.

708
00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:34.361
- 1, 2, 3.

709
00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:36.997
(Van choking)

710
00:26:37.932 --> 00:26:39.333
- Oh my god.

711
00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:40.301
- That's good.

712
00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:42.002
That's good.

713
00:26:42.036 --> 00:26:43.337
Okay, okay.

714
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.905
That's a good girl.

715
00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:46.140
Good, good.

716
00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:51.712
How much further?

717
00:26:51.745 --> 00:26:52.847
- [Gray] An hour.

718
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.150
I mean, maybe less, but we
got some big water coming.

719
00:26:58.152 --> 00:26:58.986
- Okay.

720
00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:04.091
(foreboding music)

721
00:27:07.995 --> 00:27:10.030
- [Gray] Just half a mile
to the Lone Pine bend.

722
00:27:11.465 --> 00:27:13.200
- [Joey] Okay, we gotta pack her
in.

723
00:27:14.702 --> 00:27:17.905
(eerie music building)

724
00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:24.979
- In case you go overboard,
we'll be able to see you.

725
00:27:28.182 --> 00:27:29.683
Karissa.

726
00:27:29.717 --> 00:27:30.718
And Joey.

727
00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:41.195
(water splashing)

728
00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:54.708
Okay, here it comes.

729
00:27:54.742 --> 00:27:57.244
(water roaring)

730
00:27:58.379 --> 00:27:59.413
On my call.

731
00:27:59.446 --> 00:28:01.182
Left and right.

732
00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:02.950
Listen for my voice.

733
00:28:03.951 --> 00:28:05.319
Left!

734
00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:06.453
Left!

735
00:28:06.487 --> 00:28:08.088
Now right!

736
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:08.956
Right!

737
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.958
Go together.

738
00:28:15.863 --> 00:28:17.097
Now left, left!

739
00:28:18.499 --> 00:28:23.237
(water crashing)
(intense music)

740
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.104
Right!

741
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.360
- Karissa! T-Grade!

742
00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:48.762
- Yep, I got it, I got it.

743
00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:50.130
- [Gray] Leave us some
more room on the haystack.

744
00:28:50.164 --> 00:28:51.465
- [Trevor] I got it!

745
00:28:51.498 --> 00:28:53.000
- Row, row, row!

746
00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:56.737
Okay, guys, brace!

747
00:28:57.938 --> 00:29:00.508
(water crashing)
(all struggling)

748
00:29:00.542 --> 00:29:02.409
- [Trevor] I got it, I got it.

749
00:29:02.443 --> 00:29:04.111
- [Gray] All right, get ready to
dig.

750
00:29:04.144 --> 00:29:05.913
- I can't see shit!

751
00:29:05.946 --> 00:29:07.848
- [Gray] Trevor, help me out.

752
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:09.183
Hard on the left.

753
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:10.150
Trevor.

754
00:29:10.184 --> 00:29:11.151
Left, Trevor!

755
00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:15.789
(intense music building)

756
00:29:15.823 --> 00:29:18.526
(water crashing)

757
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.764
(suspenseful music)
(water bubbling)

758
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:32.339
- [Gray] Grab on to something!

759
00:29:32.373 --> 00:29:35.976
(all screaming)
(water raging)

760
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:36.844
Joey!

761
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.280
- Gray!

762
00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:40.548
- Where's Van?

763
00:29:40.582 --> 00:29:42.783
- [Joey] I don't know!

764
00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:51.925
(Joey grunting)

765
00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:55.062
(Karissa screaming)

766
00:29:56.063 --> 00:29:56.897
Karissa!

767
00:29:58.566 --> 00:29:59.400
Karissa!

768
00:30:03.871 --> 00:30:05.005
- [Gray] Van!

769
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.576
No, no, no, no, no!

770
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:09.810
Van!

771
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:13.213
I got you, I got you, I got you.

772
00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:20.421
(Joey struggling)

773
00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:30.831
- Oh, God.

774
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.867
Gray!

775
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:35.035
- [Gray] Joey?

776
00:30:35.069 --> 00:30:36.370
Joey, over here.
- I'm coming!

777
00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:38.005
- [Gray] I've got Van!

778
00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:40.074
I don't think she's breathing.

779
00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:42.309
I can't tell, I can't tell.

780
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:44.912
Where's Karissa?

781
00:30:44.945 --> 00:30:45.647
- I don't know, I lost her.

782
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.481
- Okay, I gotta find-

783
00:30:47.515 --> 00:30:48.482
Have you seen Trevor?

784
00:30:48.516 --> 00:30:49.350
- I got you.

785
00:30:49.383 --> 00:30:50.351
- Trevor!

786
00:30:50.384 --> 00:30:51.251
Trevor!

787
00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:55.989
(chest pounding)

788
00:30:57.391 --> 00:30:59.226
- Come on, girl.

789
00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:01.529
(Joey grunting)

790
00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:03.297
- [Gray] Karissa!

791
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.965
Trevor!
- Over here!

792
00:31:07.635 --> 00:31:08.969
Help me!
- I got you.

793
00:31:09.002 --> 00:31:10.505
- [Trevor] You got eyes on
Karissa?

794
00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:11.673
(boat scraping)

795
00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:12.540
I haven't seen her.

796
00:31:12.574 --> 00:31:14.074
- [Karissa] Van!

797
00:31:15.175 --> 00:31:16.009
Van!

798
00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:21.516
(water rushing)
(Karissa struggling)

799
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:22.416
- [Trevor] Hey, you got me?

800
00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:23.917
- [Gray] Yeah, I got you.

801
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.986
- I got you.
- Okay, all right.

802
00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:28.656
Gimme your hand.
- Careful!

803
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.158
- Gimme your hand.

804
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:32.025
Come on.

805
00:31:34.294 --> 00:31:35.896
I got you, come on!

806
00:31:36.698 --> 00:31:37.898
Take it!

807
00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:41.001
Come on!

808
00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:42.236
Take it, yeah!

809
00:31:47.374 --> 00:31:48.208
Come on!

810
00:31:51.145 --> 00:31:54.148
(Trevor and Karissa struggling)

811
00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:57.951
(all breathing heavily)

812
00:31:57.985 --> 00:31:58.887
You all right, you okay?

813
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.655
I'll get her warm.
- I'll get our stuff.

814
00:32:00.688 --> 00:32:02.289
- Okay yes, sir.

815
00:32:02.322 --> 00:32:03.023
I'll get her.

816
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.024
Come with me.

817
00:32:04.992 --> 00:32:06.427
(Van choking)

818
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.327
- Here, here.

819
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:08.295
Breathe. Breathe!

820
00:32:08.328 --> 00:32:09.163
Breathe deep.

821
00:32:10.698 --> 00:32:11.965
Are you okay?

822
00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:12.667
- I'm so cold.

823
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.535
- Here, here!

824
00:32:13.568 --> 00:32:14.101
Huddle, huddle.
- Is Van breathing?

825
00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:14.803
- Get close together.

826
00:32:14.836 --> 00:32:15.670
- Is she breathing?
- Yes!

827
00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:17.471
- Are you okay?
- Need to get warm.

828
00:32:17.505 --> 00:32:18.439
- I'm gonna get-
- Wait!

829
00:32:18.472 --> 00:32:19.707
I need to talk to you.

830
00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:21.576
- I think he did that on
purpose.

831
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:23.678
Flipped us, flipped the boat.

832
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.512
- What?

833
00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:26.614
- He doesn't want us to get
help.

834
00:32:26.648 --> 00:32:27.481
- Joey, we don't have time for
this.

835
00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:28.348
- Listen to me.

836
00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:29.416
He attacked her.

837
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.685
She told me what happened.

838
00:32:30.718 --> 00:32:32.386
- He wouldn't do that.

839
00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:34.054
- He doesn't want her to tell
anyone.

840
00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:35.122
- What and then just let her
die?

841
00:32:35.155 --> 00:32:36.390
- Yes, to save his own ass.

842
00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:37.725
- No, listen.
- Yes.

843
00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:38.526
- Everyone okay?
- Yes.

844
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.461
- Yeah, yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

845
00:32:40.494 --> 00:32:41.995
- You got the gear, okay.

846
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:43.263
- Yeah, it's down there.

847
00:32:43.297 --> 00:32:43.832
- We still got 40 minutes
to the ranger station.

848
00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:44.666
I'm gonna prep the boat.

849
00:32:44.699 --> 00:32:47.134
- Okay, I'm gonna check you,
okay?

850
00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:49.336
Take some deep breaths in and
out.

851
00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:52.507
(Van struggling)

852
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.440
Okay, relax your body.

853
00:32:53.474 --> 00:32:54.509
Relax your body.

854
00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:55.677
Okay.

855
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.377
You're gonna be okay. Okay?

856
00:33:01.381 --> 00:33:04.284
(suspenseful music)

857
00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:11.158
(suspenseful music)

858
00:33:16.129 --> 00:33:18.365
(birds chirping)

859
00:33:18.398 --> 00:33:21.101
(water flowing)

860
00:33:24.672 --> 00:33:27.509
(water splashing)

861
00:33:30.377 --> 00:33:32.981
(water splashing)

862
00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:39.286
- Walt's probably not even there
yet.

863
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:42.289
- Well, you can break
in and use the landline.

864
00:33:42.322 --> 00:33:43.591
- How long?

865
00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:46.661
- Ranger says she's just
at the top of this hill.

866
00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:49.396
We can have a medevac here in 15
minutes.

867
00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:50.264
- Hurry.

868
00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:03.310
(both panting)

869
00:34:06.648 --> 00:34:08.081
- Hey, hey, hold up, hold up.

870
00:34:08.115 --> 00:34:08.783
- You alright?

871
00:34:08.816 --> 00:34:09.517
- Hold up, yeah.

872
00:34:09.551 --> 00:34:12.720
What was she saying back there?

873
00:34:12.754 --> 00:34:13.621
- Who?

874
00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:14.556
- Joey.

875
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:15.188
You guys were arguing.

876
00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:16.189
- Oh, that was nothing.

877
00:34:16.223 --> 00:34:17.157
You know how she gets.

878
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.859
- Okay, okay, hey, hey.

879
00:34:17.892 --> 00:34:18.860
You got me though, right?

880
00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:20.762
'Cause you know there's
gonna be questions.

881
00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:21.563
- Dude.
- I'm a felon.

882
00:34:21.596 --> 00:34:22.597
I'm a felon.

883
00:34:23.731 --> 00:34:24.566
You see how people look at me?

884
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.432
- That's all in your head.

885
00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:26.734
- Right, okay.

886
00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:28.168
Is it?

887
00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:30.170
I don't think it is.

888
00:34:30.203 --> 00:34:32.172
- Trevor, you didn't do anything
wrong.

889
00:34:32.205 --> 00:34:34.441
- Yeah, no shit I didn't
do anything wrong.

890
00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:36.644
Tell me, you got me.

891
00:34:36.678 --> 00:34:38.846
- I got you, yeah?

892
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.113
- I'm not going back.

893
00:34:40.147 --> 00:34:40.782
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

894
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:41.683
- I'm on probation.

895
00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:42.850
- I know that, all right?

896
00:34:42.884 --> 00:34:44.886
It's okay, calm down.

897
00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:47.387
- I did three years for you.

898
00:34:49.624 --> 00:34:53.561
Three years, you tell me that
you got me!

899
00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:54.428
Tell me!

900
00:34:57.397 --> 00:34:58.365
- I got you.

901
00:34:59.266 --> 00:35:01.468
I got you, all right?

902
00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:02.369
I got you!

903
00:35:04.438 --> 00:35:07.609
Come here, man, come here, I got
you.

904
00:35:07.642 --> 00:35:08.876
I got you, okay?

905
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:09.744
I got you.

906
00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:10.678
- Okay.

907
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:11.512
- You got me?

908
00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:12.312
- I got you.

909
00:35:12.346 --> 00:35:13.480
- I got you, all right?
- Okay.

910
00:35:13.514 --> 00:35:14.515
- We gotta go.

911
00:35:27.327 --> 00:35:28.161
- [Joey] How's she doing?

912
00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:28.863
- She's breathing.

913
00:35:28.896 --> 00:35:30.230
So it's good.

914
00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:33.367
- [Joey] She dry?

915
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.536
- Yeah, I think so mostly.

916
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.638
- [Joey] How are You?

917
00:35:36.671 --> 00:35:38.405
- Okay, how are you?

918
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.708
- No truck.

919
00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:41.576
- Walt!

920
00:35:45.813 --> 00:35:46.648
Walt!

921
00:35:48.683 --> 00:35:49.550
- Okay.

922
00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:50.785
(panting)

923
00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:53.955
(banging on door)

924
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.222
Walt?

925
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:56.658
Walt you in there?

926
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.228
Hey.

927
00:36:01.863 --> 00:36:04.632
(engine roaring)

928
00:36:11.839 --> 00:36:13.541
We got a head wound, it's bad.

929
00:36:13.574 --> 00:36:14.609
- Where at?

930
00:36:14.642 --> 00:36:15.810
- Down by the shore, we're
gonna need a chopper.

931
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.177
- Oh, Christ.

932
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.282
- She slipped and hit
her head on some rocks.

933
00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.718
The sat phone died on us.

934
00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:25.218
It's been a couple hours, man.

935
00:36:25.252 --> 00:36:26.788
We need someone fast.

936
00:36:29.322 --> 00:36:30.658
- Okay, just wait a second, wait
a second.

937
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:31.258
- What?

938
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.026
- We don't need all that.

939
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.960
It's not that-
- It is that bad.

940
00:36:32.994 --> 00:36:33.861
- No, no.

941
00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:34.796
- It's very bad.

942
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:35.362
- No, we should put her in
Walt's truck.

943
00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:36.631
It's probably faster.

944
00:36:36.664 --> 00:36:37.364
- What are you talking about?
- How about we call it in, okay?

945
00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:38.966
Let them tell us what's faster.

946
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.867
- Exactly.

947
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:40.802
- Wait, wait.

948
00:36:40.835 --> 00:36:41.803
- Hear us out, look.

949
00:36:41.836 --> 00:36:43.971
We're already in some
shit over last week's

950
00:36:44.005 --> 00:36:46.440
cabrewers with management, so...

951
00:36:46.473 --> 00:36:47.875
just we would like to not report
it.

952
00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:49.476
- Look, of this is a medical
emergency.

953
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.578
No, we've gotta call it...

954
00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:51.846
Doesn't matter if...

955
00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:52.747
- There's a doctor...

956
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.715
- Just give me the radio.

957
00:36:53.748 --> 00:36:54.649
- Trevor, it's gonna be fine.

958
00:36:54.682 --> 00:36:55.482
- You don't know that!

959
00:36:55.516 --> 00:36:57.451
- Just give me the god damn
radio!

960
00:36:57.484 --> 00:36:57.985
- Whoa!

961
00:36:58.019 --> 00:36:59.486
- Come on, dude.

962
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.489
- All right, guys, guys, guys.

963
00:37:02.523 --> 00:37:03.124
- Sorry.

964
00:37:03.157 --> 00:37:03.958
- Walt, he's cool alright.

965
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:04.992
- We're done. Right?

966
00:37:05.026 --> 00:37:05.893
- Yeah...

967
00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:06.828
- We're sorry?

968
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:07.729
- I'm done.

969
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.597
- You're done?

970
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.363
- Yeah.

971
00:37:10.397 --> 00:37:11.264
- Everybody's okay

972
00:37:11.298 --> 00:37:11.966
Everybody's okay.

973
00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:13.601
Whoa no, Trevor...

974
00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:14.602
drop it Walt.

975
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.038
Guys!

976
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:18.005
(gun bangs)

977
00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:18.740
- Stop!

978
00:37:18.773 --> 00:37:19.974
- He's trying to shoot me! dead

979
00:37:20.007 --> 00:37:20.908
(gun bangs)

980
00:37:20.942 --> 00:37:21.809
- Oh shit!

981
00:37:21.843 --> 00:37:23.310
- Oh shit! Trevor, please just
let go.

982
00:37:23.343 --> 00:37:24.712
- What the hell you doing, man.

983
00:37:24.746 --> 00:37:25.646
- Guys, come on.

984
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.246
Drop the gun.

985
00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.915
Just drop the gun, God!

986
00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:29.316
Trevor get down.

987
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:31.586
(pounding against the wall)

988
00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:32.186
Let go.

989
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.021
Let go, Trevor, let go.

990
00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:35.857
Oh, guys, guys, come on!

991
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.691
(knife slicing)

992
00:37:36.724 --> 00:37:37.592
No!

993
00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:43.998
(heavy breath)

994
00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:45.533
- What'd you do?

995
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.872
- I'm sorry, man.

996
00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:51.739
- What'd you....?

997
00:37:51.773 --> 00:37:53.306
- Oh God.

998
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.041
I'm sorry, Walt.

999
00:37:54.075 --> 00:37:54.909
You're alright. You're alright.

1000
00:37:54.942 --> 00:37:55.777
- Did you stab him?

1001
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.711
Alright. No, no.

1002
00:37:56.744 --> 00:37:57.879
- Walt, I'm sorry, man.

1003
00:37:57.912 --> 00:37:58.780
I'm sorry.

1004
00:37:58.813 --> 00:37:59.680
You all right ,bro?

1005
00:37:59.714 --> 00:38:00.548
- Walt, you okay?

1006
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:01.082
I got you.

1007
00:38:01.115 --> 00:38:01.983
Whoa, whoa.

1008
00:38:02.016 --> 00:38:03.350
Careful. Careful.

1009
00:38:03.383 --> 00:38:04.652
(body thumps to floor)

1010
00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:05.520
- Oh, Trevor.

1011
00:38:05.553 --> 00:38:06.087
It's okay.

1012
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.954
Are you okay, buddy?

1013
00:38:06.988 --> 00:38:07.855
He's okay.

1014
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:08.723
Oh, shoot.

1015
00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:09.322
Oh, no.

1016
00:38:09.356 --> 00:38:10.390
Okay. Keep pressure here.

1017
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.058
Keep pressure here.

1018
00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:11.926
Keep pressure.

1019
00:38:11.959 --> 00:38:12.894
Look at me.

1020
00:38:12.927 --> 00:38:14.662
Oh here, here, here.

1021
00:38:14.695 --> 00:38:15.563
Move. Okay.

1022
00:38:16.396 --> 00:38:17.665
I know, I know.

1023
00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:18.232
Keep pressure.

1024
00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:19.499
You gotta keep pressure.

1025
00:38:19.534 --> 00:38:22.036
Walt where's the first aid kit?

1026
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:23.938
Okay, here we go.

1027
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:24.906
Okay.

1028
00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:26.439
Okay. You're doing great.

1029
00:38:26.473 --> 00:38:26.874
You'll be fine.

1030
00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:29.043
It's okay.

1031
00:38:29.076 --> 00:38:30.443
You'll be fine.

1032
00:38:30.477 --> 00:38:31.712
All right. It's okay.

1033
00:38:31.746 --> 00:38:32.780
Here we go.

1034
00:38:32.814 --> 00:38:33.714

Okay. 3, 2, 1.

1037
00:38:35.883 --> 00:38:36.717
I know.

1038
00:38:41.055 --> 00:38:44.324
(suspenseful music)

1039
00:38:47.028 --> 00:38:49.496
- Walt we need your help buddy.

1040
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.932
We need your help.

1041
00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:55.736
(suspenseful music)

1042
00:39:00.575 --> 00:39:03.845
Keep your eyes open and look at
me.

1043
00:39:03.878 --> 00:39:05.412
Come on.

1044
00:39:05.445 --> 00:39:07.849
Trev. You gotta call for help?

1045
00:39:10.985 --> 00:39:13.855
(suspenseful music)

1046
00:39:17.124 --> 00:39:20.427
(suspenseful music)

1047
00:39:22.697 --> 00:39:23.731

Oh God.

1051
00:39:32.874 --> 00:39:33.841
Did you call?

1052
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.144
- Let him go?

1053
00:39:37.178 --> 00:39:38.378
- Trevor.

1054
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.480
- Great, brother.

1055
00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:42.016
Walk away yeah.

1056
00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:42.917

1057
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.120
- Walk away.

1058
00:39:46.153 --> 00:39:47.655
Just let him go.

1059
00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:53.794
- Trev I know you're not
pointing that gun at me.

1060
00:39:56.664 --> 00:39:57.497
Come on.

1061
00:39:57.531 --> 00:39:58.199
- We gotta help him.

1062
00:39:58.232 --> 00:39:59.100
- He's done.

1063
00:39:59.133 --> 00:40:00.868
- No It's not too late.

1064
00:40:00.902 --> 00:40:01.769
We can save him.

1065
00:40:01.802 --> 00:40:02.570
- And then what?

1066
00:40:02.603 --> 00:40:05.673
- And then you're not a
murderer!

1067
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:06.207
Whoa, whoa.

1068
00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.108
Come on man.

1069
00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:07.975
Open your eyes.

1070
00:40:08.009 --> 00:40:09.510
Come on.

1071
00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:10.945
- He's just done.

1072
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:12.013
He's done looking at him.

1073
00:40:12.046 --> 00:40:12.914
He's done.

1074
00:40:12.947 --> 00:40:14.515
It's on me.

1075
00:40:14.548 --> 00:40:15.750
- You're making it so much
worse.

1076
00:40:15.783 --> 00:40:16.918
- I know!

1077
00:40:16.951 --> 00:40:18.819
You don't think I know!

1078
00:40:20.755 --> 00:40:21.756
Look at him.

1079
00:40:21.789 --> 00:40:23.057
Look, he's not even moving
anymore.

1080
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.158
- Come on Wal, Walt.

1081
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:25.059
Come on Walt.

1082
00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:25.927
No. No.

1083
00:40:28.729 --> 00:40:30.164
- Okay. We still gotta
call at least for a van.

1084
00:40:30.197 --> 00:40:31.132
- No!

1085
00:40:31.165 --> 00:40:33.935
(smashing)

1086
00:40:33.968 --> 00:40:36.170
No one's calling anyone!

1087
00:40:36.203 --> 00:40:39.472
(suspenseful music)

1088
00:40:43.077 --> 00:40:44.578
- I have a plan.

1089
00:40:44.612 --> 00:40:45.513
(suspenseful music)

1090
00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:48.082
You still got me right?

1091
00:40:48.115 --> 00:40:51.018
(suspenseful music)

1092
00:40:53.888 --> 00:40:56.691
(lighter flicks)

1093
00:41:04.598 --> 00:41:06.934
(car moving)

1094
00:41:11.138 --> 00:41:13.741
(car crashes)

1095
00:41:24.218 --> 00:41:26.887
(car explodes)

1096
00:41:30.091 --> 00:41:32.727
(fire blazing)

1097
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.734
(suspenseful music)

1098
00:41:43.137 --> 00:41:46.040
(suspenseful music)

1099
00:41:51.946 --> 00:41:54.949
(gentle upbeat music)

1100
00:42:03.958 --> 00:42:06.927
(suspenseful music)

1101
00:42:09.296 --> 00:42:10.131
- What are you doing?

1102
00:42:10.164 --> 00:42:13.100
- They should have been back by
now.

1103
00:42:16.937 --> 00:42:19.874
(suspenseful music)

1104
00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:23.277
- They're coming.

1105
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.245
- New plan.

1106
00:42:24.278 --> 00:42:26.614
We can get back in the
boat and head north.

1107
00:42:26.647 --> 00:42:28.916
- Wait, what are you talking
about?

1108
00:42:28.949 --> 00:42:32.253
- There's a tributary we'll
split off on.

1109
00:42:32.286 --> 00:42:34.655
It's a shortcut to Canada.

1110
00:42:35.823 --> 00:42:37.958
There's no border patrol.

1111
00:42:39.627 --> 00:42:41.562
- Where's the ranger?

1112
00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:44.065
- He's dead.

1113
00:42:45.766 --> 00:42:48.169
No stop until we get to Canada.

1114
00:42:52.773 --> 00:42:57.111
- Gray... don't let him do
this.

1115
00:42:59.246 --> 00:43:02.149
(suspenseful music)

1116
00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:07.988
(suspenseful music)

1117
00:43:10.758 --> 00:43:12.026
So we're hostages now.

1118
00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:13.227
- Just get me to Canada.

1119
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.695
You're all free to go.

1120
00:43:14.728 --> 00:43:16.597
- She won't make it.

1121
00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:22.369
She will die if we get back on
the water.

1122
00:43:22.403 --> 00:43:23.337
And you're okay with that?

1123
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.405
You're okay letting her die?

1124
00:43:24.438 --> 00:43:25.339
- No!

1125
00:43:25.372 --> 00:43:27.141
I'm not okay with it.

1126
00:43:29.276 --> 00:43:30.778
Get in the boat.

1127
00:43:34.415 --> 00:43:35.983
Let's go come on.

1128
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:40.121
- Let's go.

1129
00:43:40.154 --> 00:43:43.023
(suspenseful music)

1130
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.163
(suspenseful music)

1131
00:43:54.401 --> 00:43:57.671
(suspenseful music)

1132
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:05.212
(suspenseful music)

1133
00:44:09.049 --> 00:44:11.952
(suspenseful music)

1134
00:44:23.297 --> 00:44:26.200
(suspenseful music)

1135
00:44:28.802 --> 00:44:31.872
(suspenseful music)

1136
00:44:43.117 --> 00:44:45.886
(birds chirping)

1137
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.226
(water splashing)

1138
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.033
(water splashing)

1139
00:45:02.203 --> 00:45:04.972
(birds chirping)

1140
00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:12.713
(water splashing)

1141
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:22.089
(water splashing)

1142
00:45:28.262 --> 00:45:31.065
(water splashing)

1143
00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:37.104
(water splashing)

1144
00:45:42.276 --> 00:45:45.079
(water splashing)

1145
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:50.317
(birds chirping)

1146
00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:54.288
(birds chirping)

1147
00:45:56.423 --> 00:45:59.226
(water splashing)

1148
00:46:04.465 --> 00:46:05.766
- Hey there.

1149
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.137
You guys all right?

1150
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.105
- Hey, yeah.

1151
00:46:12.406 --> 00:46:13.907
You?

1152
00:46:13.941 --> 00:46:16.110
- You guys need some help?

1153
00:46:18.045 --> 00:46:18.912
- No.

1154
00:46:18.946 --> 00:46:20.582
She just had a little fall.

1155
00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:22.182
She's good.

1156
00:46:22.216 --> 00:46:25.853
And she's a doctor, so
she's in good hands.

1157
00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:27.221
Where you headed?

1158
00:46:29.189 --> 00:46:30.592
- I'm just up here.

1159
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:33.294
Just few miles up past
Horseshoe.

1160
00:46:33.327 --> 00:46:34.529
There's a really nice
camping spot out there.

1161
00:46:34.562 --> 00:46:36.163
- Oh yeah sure.

1162
00:46:36.196 --> 00:46:36.731
Gorgeous.

1163
00:46:36.765 --> 00:46:38.499
- Have you been there?

1164
00:46:38.533 --> 00:46:41.068
- Yeah, but I've been meaning to
get back.

1165
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:45.172
Listen, if you guys need
me to go get help I can.

1166
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.608
- No, no.

1167
00:46:46.641 --> 00:46:48.042
It's okay.

1168
00:46:48.075 --> 00:46:51.345
We got our car at the next
takeout.

1169
00:46:51.378 --> 00:46:52.012
- Got it.

1170
00:46:54.348 --> 00:46:56.518
Hope your friend feels better.

1171
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:57.918
- Yeah, man. Thanks.

1172
00:46:57.951 --> 00:46:59.119
Have a good one.

1173
00:46:59.153 --> 00:46:59.987
- Yep.

1174
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.226
(birds chirping)

1175
00:47:15.035 --> 00:47:16.003
- God damn it he knows.

1176
00:47:16.036 --> 00:47:17.471
We gotta find a way up there.

1177
00:47:17.505 --> 00:47:18.372
- To do what?

1178
00:47:18.405 --> 00:47:19.239
- I don't know.

1179
00:47:19.273 --> 00:47:20.140
Talk to him.

1180
00:47:20.174 --> 00:47:20.809
I don't know.

1181
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:21.576
- He doesn't know anything.

1182
00:47:21.609 --> 00:47:23.077
- Unless he's blind.

1183
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.345
He can clearly see there's
a dead girl on the raft.

1184
00:47:24.378 --> 00:47:25.245
- Trev.

1185
00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:27.448
- He's going for help right now
100%.

1186
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.616
- I promise you he's not.

1187
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.450
- You promise me?

1188
00:47:29.483 --> 00:47:31.619
'Cause you know everything,
right?

1189
00:47:31.653 --> 00:47:34.121
Why you gonna say your serenity
prayer?

1190
00:47:34.154 --> 00:47:34.922
Huh?

1191
00:47:34.955 --> 00:47:36.256
God Gimme this strength.

1192
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.991
Go gimme this drink.

1193
00:47:40.528 --> 00:47:41.428
(Trevor groans)

1194
00:47:41.462 --> 00:47:42.296
Okay.

1195
00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:43.631
Hey.

1196
00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.199
Gray. I'm sorry.

1197
00:47:46.634 --> 00:47:47.434
I'm sorry, man.

1198
00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.203
Okay, let's push through the
night.

1199
00:47:49.236 --> 00:47:50.638
- No, no.

1200
00:47:50.672 --> 00:47:52.139
- He's going for help right now.

1201
00:47:52.172 --> 00:47:53.608
And he's going to find somebody

1202
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:54.609
and they're going to catch up.

1203
00:47:54.642 --> 00:47:55.510
- No, we can't do it.

1204
00:47:55.543 --> 00:47:56.611
Okay. We cannot do it.

1205
00:47:56.644 --> 00:47:57.911
We will not survive.

1206
00:47:57.945 --> 00:47:59.146
I'm drawing the line.

1207
00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:02.015
Lone pine is one thing, but
in broad daylight, you can't.

1208
00:48:02.049 --> 00:48:04.184
I won't allow it.

1209
00:48:04.218 --> 00:48:07.154
- Who's got the gun here,
brother.

1210
00:48:08.656 --> 00:48:10.525
- You do big man.

1211
00:48:10.558 --> 00:48:12.292
So pull the trigger.

1212
00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:15.530
'Cause if you make us go
over the beast at night,

1213
00:48:15.563 --> 00:48:18.432
you're killing us anyway.

1214
00:48:18.465 --> 00:48:19.400
We can't do it.

1215
00:48:19.433 --> 00:48:20.434
Okay. We can't do it.

1216
00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:21.669
If you want to get to Canada

1217
00:48:21.703 --> 00:48:24.338
if you want to get through
this, we need to work together.

1218
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:26.708
Even if he's going to get help
right now

1219
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.410
we're splitting off in
two miles of boundary run.

1220
00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:34.047
No one goes that way unless
they're doing the beast.

1221
00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:44.992
- Okay, let's split off everyone
paddle.

1222
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:47.327
Pick up a paddle everyone go.

1223
00:48:50.998 --> 00:48:53.967
(water splashing)

1224
00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:59.973
(suspenseful music)

1225
00:49:05.212 --> 00:49:08.215
(suspenseful music)

1226
00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:13.253
(suspenseful music)

1227
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.060
(water splashing)

1228
00:49:25.132 --> 00:49:28.235
(suspenseful music)

1229
00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:34.408
(water splashing)

1230
00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:39.246
- All right.

1231
00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:41.982
I think we're deep enough in.

1232
00:49:45.118 --> 00:49:48.088
These girls can't paddle much
more.

1233
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.258
- Okay find an easy takeout.

1234
00:49:52.794 --> 00:49:56.396
Somewhere with soft
soil so we can bury her.

1235
00:49:58.398 --> 00:49:59.299
- Bury her?

1236
00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:06.273
I can't just

1237
00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:08.408
- We have to.

1238
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:14.414
There's too much weight
for the last lake tomorrow.

1239
00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:21.623
(speaks in foreign language)

1240
00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:27.194
(water splashing)

1241
00:50:30.798 --> 00:50:33.568
(ethereal music)

1242
00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:44.378
(ethereal music)

1243
00:50:49.449 --> 00:50:52.219
(ethereal music)

1244
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.596
(ethereal music)

1245
00:51:07.602 --> 00:51:10.538
(all digging ground)

1246
00:51:15.142 --> 00:51:18.078
(ethereal music)

1247
00:51:25.587 --> 00:51:28.355
(ethereal music)

1248
00:51:36.698 --> 00:51:39.499
(leaves rustling)

1249
00:51:53.648 --> 00:51:56.216
(fly buzzing)

1250
00:51:56.249 --> 00:51:57.652
- How much further

1251
00:51:59.252 --> 00:52:01.488
- Until no one can find us.

1252
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.837
- Be an awful quiet up there,
brother.

1253
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.873
You thinking about how to get
this gun?

1254
00:52:18.906 --> 00:52:20.775
So I'm a bad guy now.

1255
00:52:20.808 --> 00:52:21.676
Yeah.

1256
00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:25.780
After all I did for you.

1257
00:52:25.813 --> 00:52:27.447
She doesn't even know, does she?

1258
00:52:27.481 --> 00:52:28.348
Do you?

1259
00:52:28.382 --> 00:52:31.385
You know about this guy's side
hustle?

1260
00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:31.919
Not mine.

1261
00:52:31.953 --> 00:52:32.820
Mind you his.

1262
00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:33.721
- Trev!

1263
00:52:33.755 --> 00:52:34.656
- What?

1264
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:35.523
You were good at it.

1265
00:52:35.556 --> 00:52:37.324
Hey, hold up.

1266
00:52:37.357 --> 00:52:40.327
This guy was slinging more
rock than anyone in East Boise.

1267
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.396
He had a real good run.

1268
00:52:43.296 --> 00:52:44.666
Keep walking. Go.

1269
00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:50.938
- This Dayton (indistinct)
got her pregnant?

1270
00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:53.273
I couldn't let him do
time for distribution.

1271
00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:56.243
Not when he had something good.

1272
00:52:56.276 --> 00:52:57.177
I didn't have anything.

1273
00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.946
But this life was turning into
something.

1274
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.449
I couldn't let that get all
messed up.

1275
00:53:02.482 --> 00:53:03.951
I was home when the cops busted
in.

1276
00:53:03.985 --> 00:53:04.919
- I didn't ask you to.

1277
00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:06.621
- You didn't have to.

1278
00:53:06.654 --> 00:53:10.357
I knew what to do because we're
brothers.

1279
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.859
I cracked (indistinct).

1280
00:53:11.893 --> 00:53:14.529
The only family I ever had man.

1281
00:53:15.596 --> 00:53:17.197
You too Joey Bean.

1282
00:53:17.999 --> 00:53:20.601
You look a little sister to me.

1283
00:53:24.038 --> 00:53:25.238
Let's go.

1284
00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:38.218
(crickets chirping)

1285
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.625
Sorry does that hurt?

1286
00:53:48.763 --> 00:53:49.597
The cold?

1287
00:53:51.999 --> 00:53:55.302
(crickets chirping)

1288
00:54:00.307 --> 00:54:03.376
(crickets chirping)

1289
00:54:09.449 --> 00:54:12.520
(crickets chirping)

1290
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.295
(crickets chirping)

1291
00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:33.808
Look...

1292
00:54:36.844 --> 00:54:39.747
I promise, we're gonna make it.

1293
00:54:45.352 --> 00:54:48.689
Everyone just stressed
up we got a big day.

1294
00:54:50.825 --> 00:54:53.761
(crickets chirping)

1295
00:55:01.135 --> 00:55:04.437
(crickets chirping)

1296
00:55:14.782 --> 00:55:16.517
(sighs)

1297
00:55:20.588 --> 00:55:21.956
Remember that song we used to
sing

1298
00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:24.457
in our tents off Snake River.

1299
00:55:30.531 --> 00:55:33.801
♪ All I really want to do is
get away ♪

1300
00:55:38.773 --> 00:55:41.843
♪ Every other day is something
new ♪

(crickets chirping)

1310
00:56:29.924 --> 00:56:32.459
(wolf howls)

1311
00:56:37.798 --> 00:56:40.701
(crickets chirping)

1312
00:56:48.943 --> 00:56:51.913
(crickets chirping)

1313
00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:56.717
- You promised.

1314
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.923
She said you weren't involved.

1315
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:08.729
- I was so out of my mind back
then.

1316
00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:10.531
Didn't even know what I was
doing.

1317
00:57:10.564 --> 00:57:13.567
- Probably whatever he wanted
you to.

1318
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:17.672
- God, you're still his bitch.

1319
00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:18.205
No?

1320
00:57:18.239 --> 00:57:19.941
- No.

1321
00:57:19.974 --> 00:57:20.942
- Then do something.

1322
00:57:20.975 --> 00:57:22.209
I'm tied up too.

1323
00:57:22.243 --> 00:57:23.177
- You had chances.

1324
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:24.245
- You'll have more.

1325
00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:25.846
- He has a gun.

1326
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.648
Do you really think I'm
okay with any of this?

1327
00:57:27.682 --> 00:57:29.850
- It's between me and him.

1328
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.821
It'll always be him.

1329
00:57:33.854 --> 00:57:36.824
(crickets chirping)

1330
00:57:36.857 --> 00:57:38.458
- That's not true.

1331
00:57:40.127 --> 00:57:43.064
(crickets chirping)

1332
00:57:48.135 --> 00:57:51.072
(crickets chirping)

1333
00:57:58.646 --> 00:58:01.749
(crickets chirping)

1334
00:58:05.686 --> 00:58:06.754
- The summer.

1335
00:58:07.621 --> 00:58:10.691
(crickets chirping)

1336
00:58:15.696 --> 00:58:18.566
The summer you rented the cabin.

1337
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:25.106
(crickets chirping)

1338
00:58:29.243 --> 00:58:30.077
You...

1339
00:58:40.054 --> 00:58:41.822
You let him...

1340
00:58:44.892 --> 00:58:45.993
use me.

1341
00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:54.735
Like a toy, like a gift.

1342
00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:01.542
- No, what?

1343
00:59:02.343 --> 00:59:03.878
You liked him.

1344
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:04.845
You...

1345
00:59:04.879 --> 00:59:05.813
- I was 15.

1346
00:59:12.686 --> 00:59:14.021
You were my brother.

1347
00:59:19.727 --> 00:59:22.830
(crickets chirping)

1348
00:59:24.698 --> 00:59:27.768
(crickets chirping)

1349
00:59:32.706 --> 00:59:35.810
(crickets chirping)

1350
00:59:39.747 --> 00:59:42.850
(crickets chirping)

1351
00:59:47.288 --> 00:59:48.856
Wait, wait, wait.

1352
00:59:50.057 --> 00:59:52.993
(crickets chirping)

1353
00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:57.031
(crickets chirping)

1354
01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:04.738
(crickets chirping)

1355
01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:12.046
(crickets chirping)

1356
01:00:15.382 --> 01:00:18.652
(crickets chirping)

1357
01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:22.756
(crickets chirping)

1358
01:00:27.461 --> 01:00:30.764
(crickets chirping)

1359
01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:38.739
(crickets chirping)

1360
01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.247
(crickets chirping)

1361
01:00:48.782 --> 01:00:52.019
(crickets chirping)

1362
01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:52.987
Thank you.

1363
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.023
- I knew something wasn't right.

1364
01:00:56.056 --> 01:00:56.924
- Guys.

1365
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:04.732
- I've been following you
guys since the bridge.

1366
01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.300
- Did you call for help?

1367
01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.035
- I don't have a sat.

1368
01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:09.970
Nearest visit is as soon
as a day's hike from here.

1369
01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:11.405
It was getting dark, so I
thought I--

1370
01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:12.306
(gun bangs)

1371
01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:13.174
(cries)

1372
01:01:13.207 --> 01:01:15.809
(body thuds)

1373
01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:27.254
- Stupid piece of shit!

1374
01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:30.057
- Fucking you!

1375
01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:31.959
- You hero.

1376
01:01:38.533 --> 01:01:40.334
- Did you do that?

1377
01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.468
Did you call for help?

1378
01:01:41.502 --> 01:01:42.469
- No Trevor, she didn't.

1379
01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:43.304
He just showed up.

1380
01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.939
He was just a hiker and showed
up.

1381
01:01:44.972 --> 01:01:45.472
It's over.

1382
01:01:45.507 --> 01:01:46.340
No, no.

1383
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:47.241
Trevor, don't do this.

1384
01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.175
Trevor!

1385
01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:49.076
Listen to me.

1386
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.977
The beast.

1387
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:50.778
You need us.

1388
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:51.812
You're not doing the beast
alone.

1389
01:01:51.845 --> 01:01:52.514
You can't, right?

1390
01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.414
You need us.

1391
01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:55.316
You need hostages in case goes
sideways.

1392
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:56.183
Right?

1393
01:01:57.318 --> 01:01:59.453
I'm still in this with you.

1394
01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:01.222
Please, please don't.

1395
01:02:07.361 --> 01:02:09.230
- Fucking please don't.

1396
01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:15.236
(cries)

1397
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.782
(sighs)

1398
01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:32.019
It's okay.

1399
01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.154
- I know.

1400
01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:35.022
- It's all right.

1401
01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:36.023
- I know.

1402
01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:36.890
Yeah.

1403
01:02:39.893 --> 01:02:41.028
- Gotta bury another body.

1404
01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:43.063
(laughs)

1405
01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:44.898
- I know.

1406
01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:46.900
I know, man.

1407
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:50.037
(crickets chirping)

1408
01:02:54.208 --> 01:02:56.977
(birds chirping)

1409
01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:01.081
(crow cawing)

1410
01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:16.063
(leaves rustling)

1411
01:03:51.465 --> 01:03:54.201
(dramatic music)

1412
01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.338
- You flip us, they drown.

1413
01:03:58.506 --> 01:03:59.373
So.

1414
01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:10.217
(water splashing gently)

1415
01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:14.922
(ominous music)

1416
01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:49.390
- We gotta untie them.

1417
01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:52.292
- Can't.

1418
01:04:52.326 --> 01:04:53.427
- We're gonna flip.

1419
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.063
Last time I did the Beast
with four pros we ate shit.

1420
01:04:56.096 --> 01:04:56.997
One got a concussion.

1421
01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:57.931
- You know he lived.

1422
01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.400
- Barely, all right.

1423
01:04:59.433 --> 01:05:01.135
It was stupid luck.

1424
01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:02.236
We caught the right current.

1425
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:04.204
If you don't get to the
shore after the third drop

1426
01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:05.707
you go straight over the falls.

1427
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.207
Instant death, lights out!

1428
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:08.976
- Hey, hey!

1429
01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:10.545
You're Gray Reese,
you've known this river.

1430
01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:11.378
Come on now!

1431
01:05:11.412 --> 01:05:13.013
- Trevor, please, I'm begging
you.

1432
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:14.181
I'm begging you.

1433
01:05:14.214 --> 01:05:14.883
Let them go.

1434
01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:16.083
You have to let them go, okay?

1435
01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:17.317
Don't make this worse.

1436
01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.620
If anything, it'll lighten the
boat.

1437
01:05:18.653 --> 01:05:19.554
You and I working together,

1438
01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.155
we have a better shot anyway!

1439
01:05:23.691 --> 01:05:25.092
- I need hostages.

1440
01:05:25.993 --> 01:05:26.960
Like you said.

1441
01:05:28.696 --> 01:05:30.063
(dramatic music)

1442
01:05:30.097 --> 01:05:31.198
- Trevor, it's Joey.

1443
01:05:37.572 --> 01:05:38.472
I'm begging you.

1444
01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.077
Let them go.

1445
01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:51.318
(air hissing)

1446
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.354
- Just do your best.

1447
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.768
(water splashing)

1448
01:06:06.801 --> 01:06:08.101
- Whatever happens,

1449
01:06:09.637 --> 01:06:11.038
I hope you die first.

1450
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:24.519
(thunder rumbling)

1451
01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:35.262
(water splashing)

1452
01:06:41.468 --> 01:06:44.404
(gun slide cocking)

1453

(air hissing)

1455
01:06:51.411 --> 01:06:52.514
Did you do that?

1456
01:06:53.548 --> 01:06:54.414
Did you?!

1457
01:06:58.786 --> 01:07:00.087
Are you lying to me?

1458
01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:02.557
- No.

1459
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.591

(thunder rumbling)

1461
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.664
Find a takeout.

1462
01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:10.532
We need to patch it.

1463
01:07:18.806 --> 01:07:22.042
(thunder rumbling)

1464
01:07:27.447 --> 01:07:28.348
Let's go, patch kit.

Do it quick.

1466
01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:39.794

1467
01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:40.628
- [Gray] Yeah.

1468
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:43.297
- Well c'mon, let's go.

1469
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.165
We gotta cross the Beast
before they find Walter-

1470
01:07:45.198 --> 01:07:46.500
(spray hissing)

1471
01:07:46.534 --> 01:07:48.201

- You're gonna need to
get ready to run, okay?

1508
01:09:19.927 --> 01:09:20.728
Don't look back.

1509
01:09:20.762 --> 01:09:22.429

Don't stop 'till you get home.

1529
01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:32.567
- No, no, what about you?

1530
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.267
- I have to go back for Gray!

1531
01:10:34.301 --> 01:10:34.969

Gray!

Gray!

1549
01:11:39.834 --> 01:11:40.668
Gray, I'm here, I'm here!

1550
01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:42.069

It's okay.

1557
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.911
Hold it.

1558
01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:50.778
Pressure, okay?

1559
01:11:50.812 --> 01:11:51.746
Listen to me.

1560
01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:52.345
- I can't make it.

1561
01:11:52.379 --> 01:11:53.247
- Look at me, look at me.

1562
01:11:53.281 --> 01:11:54.582
Gray, we're gonna have to move,
okay?

1563
01:11:54.615 --> 01:11:55.116
- I can't.

1564
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:56.117
- Come on!

1565
01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:57.685
I'm gonna lift you!

1566
01:11:57.718 --> 01:11:58.418
1, 2, 3, go!

(Gray groans)

1568
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.087
Try! Please!

(people speaking faintly)

1589
01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.726
- [Kayaker] All right.

1590
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:14.929
- [Trevor] Hey!

1591
01:13:15.963 --> 01:13:16.797
Hey!

1592
01:13:17.932 --> 01:13:18.799
Hold up!

1593
01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:24.672
- [Kayaker] You need help?

1594
01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:26.641
- Yeah!

1595
01:13:29.543 --> 01:13:30.111
- You gotta keep pressure on
that.

1596
01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.212
- I know.

1597
01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.480
(gun firing repeatedly)

1598

1599
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:38.819
- [Joey] Okay.

1600
01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:40.187
You're gonna make it.

1601
01:13:40.221 --> 01:13:41.956
- You gotta pull this off.

1602
01:13:41.989 --> 01:13:42.757
(Gray gasping)
- And do what?

1603
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:43.524
Run?

1604
01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:44.558
He'll catch us.

1605
01:13:44.592 --> 01:13:45.693
- [Gray] He just wants
to get past the border.

1606
01:13:45.726 --> 01:13:48.195
- And he knows if we make
it there first he's screwed.

1607
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:49.563
Gotta keep pressure on it.

1608
01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:51.165
(Gray groaning)

1609
01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:52.033
- Ah!

1610
01:13:56.237 --> 01:13:58.072
If we keep going, we'll die.

1611
01:13:58.105 --> 01:13:59.573
Helmets or not.

1612
01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:02.810
- You said that there's
shore before the falls.

1613
01:14:04.612 --> 01:14:06.247
- You don't know how.

1614
01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.581
- You're gonna tell me.

1615
01:14:10.217 --> 01:14:13.554

(gun clicking)

1623
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.074
- [Gray] In the first side of
the middle!

1624
01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:07.942
Nice and easy!

1625
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:09.310
- Okay.

1626
01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:10.544
Hold on!

1627
01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:15.149
Hold on!

1628
01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:20.087
Stay with me!

1629
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:28.863
- You gotta cut left hard.

1630
01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:30.765
You gotta get to the far left!

1631
01:15:30.798 --> 01:15:31.465
- Copy!

1632
01:15:31.499 --> 01:15:32.333
- Otherwise we won't make it.

1633
01:15:32.366 --> 01:15:34.035
We'll be headed right for the
falls.

1634
01:15:35.069 --> 01:15:35.936
- Okay!

1635
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:37.605
Here we go!

1636
01:15:37.638 --> 01:15:39.140
