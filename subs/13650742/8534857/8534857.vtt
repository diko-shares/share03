- [girl 2] <i>It is hot out, but it's nice.</i>

3
00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.833
[girl 2] <i>I'm so excited to go to school.
I'm sad to leave this, though.</i>

4
00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:44.750
[girl 1] <i>Boys, boys, boys, boys...
Brand new boys.</i>

5
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.625
[girl 2] <i>You'll probably find
some pretty boys in Santa Barbara.</i>

6
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.083
<i>Yeah, I think I'm going to be on
the lookout for hot water polo players.</i>

7
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.166
[girl 2] <i>Nice.</i>

8
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.250
<i>I'm going to get something to drink.</i>

9
00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:58.958
<i>- Yeah, I'll go with you. I'm really hot.
- Yeah, let's go inside. I'm frying.</i>

15
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.250
<i>Sugar Pie. Sugar Pie!</i>

16
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.583
<i>Sugar Pie! Sugar Pie.</i>

17
00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:24.333
Oh, God, I can't stand
looking at that poor woman.

18
00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.708
Hey. Hi.

19
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:33.125
[tv show host] <i>Let's give it up
for Anna Nicole Smith.</i>

20
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:36.583
My head is killing me,
and this isn't helping.

21
00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.208
[Anna Nicole] <i>I was so embarrassed, and...</i>

22
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.083
I got you nachos.

23
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.833
- [dog barks]
- [Anna Nicole] <i>Sugar Pie! Shut up...</i>

24
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.833
- Well, did you give him his shot?
- Yes, I did.

25
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.500
Did you vacuum?

26
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.208
- Yeah.
- Doesn't look like it.

27
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.291
'Cause the carpet's a thousand years old.

28
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.708
God, this place really has
turned into a shit hole.

29
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.165
I'm going to need your help
with him in the morning.

30
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.708
I can't. I'll miss the van.

31
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.208
Oh, Doris, it's a big day.
You don't have to go to school.

32
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.583
[Doris] But I want to go.

33
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.250
- You'll be late and I'll write you a note.
- No, please, Mom.

34
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.000
I'll have to interrupt class
and everyone looks at me...

35
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.083
It's really embarrassing.

36
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.833
Oh it's really embarrassing. Oh, well...

37
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.559
Oh, well, then I guess I'll just have to
drop your brother off by myself,

38
00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.059
because God forbid,
you should be embarrassed.

39
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:41.458
Okay, fine. I'll come. Forget it.

40
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.166
No? Oh, are you sure?

41
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.125
You sure? Because I wouldn't want you
to blush in front of your friends.

42
00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:49.125
I don't have any friends.
And fine, I said forget it.

43
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.375
[Anna Nicole] <i>Sugar Pie,
shut the</i> [bleep] <i>up.</i>

44
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:02.708
- [grunting]
- [Mom] Okay. One, two, three. Go.

45
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.083
[Mom] Oh, my God. Okay.

46
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.125
- [Mom] Lift him up.
- [Doris] I'm trying.

47
00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:08.375
Come on.

48
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.333
[vehicle brakes]

49
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm taking her today.

50
00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:16.250
You can go.

51
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:21.791
[Mom] What is he? Deaf?

52
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.875
Mom, stop yelling.
He obviously can't hear you.

53
00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958
Okay.

54
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.166
Hello?

55
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.625
I'm taking her. You can go!

56
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.625
- Drive away!
- Mom, stop yelling.

57
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.291
Everyone is staring at us.

58
00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:40.458
[Mom] Okay, lift his upper body.
Up, here we go.

59
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.416
There we go. That's good.

60
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.708
All right, sweetheart. Sorry.

61
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.041
I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.416
Can I drive?

63
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.340
[Mom] What? No, no, no, no.
We don't have time.

64
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.375
- Come on, you never let me...
- Doris!

65
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.458
Please, not today.

66
00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:57.833
Okay.

67
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.250
All right.

68
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.875
[Mom] [stammering] Get in the back!

69
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.041
- What?
- The latch has been screwy.

70
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.851
You got to make sure
his chair doesn't fall out.

71
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.250
My hair is gonna go nuts.

72
00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.083
Your hair?

73
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.333
[Mom] Goddamn piece of crap.

74
00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.208
For fuck's sake.

75
00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.833
[engine revs]

76
00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:56.000
[gentle music throughout]

77
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.750
[horn honks]

78
00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.583
[crowd chattering]

79
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:55.208
Excuse me. If you don't mind
I just need to check your bags.

80
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.541
Why?

81
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.767
[security guard] Unfortunately,
the staff gets a lot of threats

82
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:01.791
since Mrs. Schiavo got here.

83
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.601
[Mom] So you think while I'm dropping
my son off, I'm going to kill someone?

84
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.333
[Doris] Just let her check your bags.

85
00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:10.291
Hi, there. Is everything okay?
I'm Mia, the Director of Nursing.

86
00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:12.833
- You're the Director? How old are you?
- Mom!

87
00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:14.791
- It's okay.
- What? It's just a question.

88
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:17.750
How old are you?
'Cause you do. You look young.

89
00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.541
[Mia] I actually get that a lot.

90
00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.000
Don't worry about your bags.

91
00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:26.083
If you both want to follow me,
I can check you in.

92
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.833
This way.

93
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:33.291
[crowd shouting outside]

94
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.666
[light scrubbing]

95
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.416
[Mom] I can't believe that teenager
just shoved us in here.

96
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.000
Look at this. Look!

97
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.541
Look at this.

98
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.125
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm going to clean this place up.

99
00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:53.333
This room is way cleaner than our house.

100
00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.208
I don't know if this...

101
00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.726
Do you think this is
the right place for him?

102
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.333
I just... I'm not so sure.

103
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:02.500
You'd say that about any place.

104
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:04.875
Are you not at all upset about this?

105
00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.500
This is it, Doris.

106
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.125
This filthy box is where
your brother's going to die.

107
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.791
Of course I'm upset.

108
00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.833
Can we go soon? I'm already really late.

109
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:20.583
You know, you could just try and think
about someone other than yourself.

110
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.041
You might like it.

111
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.583
Brad and Jen just broke up.

112
00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.892
Right now I'm thinking about them.

113
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.458
Oh, they did?

114
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I knew they would.

115
00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.875
The second they got married.
What did I say?

116
00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.638
- He's too handsome.
- "He's too handsome."

117
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.541
The handsome ones never stay.

118
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.541
Like your brother.

119
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.666
Too handsome for this world.

120
00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.333
Can we go now, please?

121
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.958
[gentle music plays]

122
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:01.333
Welcome back, Doris. Thank you.

123
00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:08.333
[student 1] Dude, she said it was a
one-time thing, like, I don't know.

124
00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:09.625
Oh, my gosh.

125
00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:12.208
You seriously think
Cody's hooking up with Tiffany?

126
00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:15.208
I know for a fact he did
and good riddance.

127
00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.416
Let her keep his dirty dick.

128
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.976
[student 2] He is not
hooking up with Tiffany.

129
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.166
[student 1] Bullshit.
Tiffany told me herself.

130
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.000
She showed me a hickey.
It was shaped like Cody's dirty mouth.

131
00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.892
[student 2] Okay, well,
y'all should come over later.

132
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:28.184
Okay, we're gonna grill by the pool
and Cody will be there,

133
00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:29.625
so you can just ask him yourself.

134
00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:31.375
Okay. Cody's going to be there?

135
00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:35.083
Yes, you best believe my ass will be there
'cause I'm done with these rumors.

136
00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:37.846
[teacher] Okay. Sounds like
most of us are done with the assignment.

137
00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:43.041
So let's talk about being naked in public.

138
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.625
Is that an ethics question?

139
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:48.708
Yes, Adam.

140
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:51.291
Well, that depends on
the laws of the land.

141
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:52.458
[teacher] Exactly.

142
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:57.166
Banning public nudity is a rule
of a particular society, our society,

143
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.250
especially this classroom.

144
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.375
But what about Christian ethics?

145
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.458
How do they differ
from the law of the land?

146
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.375
[school bell rings]

147
00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:10.500
[teacher] Whoa, what's your hurry?
Am I that boring?

148
00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:15.916
Oh, excuse me.

149
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.416
Yeah, okay.

150
00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:19.583
[high-pitched sustained beep]

151
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:23.291
[Mom] Do you hear it? It's like...
[screeches]

152
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.000
It's got to be driving him insane.

153
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:30.375
Do not worry, honey.
I'm going to fix this.

154
00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:31.625
[Doris] I doubt he hears it.

155
00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:33.625
Here, get up. I need your chair.

156
00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:35.958
[beep continues]

157
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.791
Of course... I told that robot
at the front desk,

158
00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:40.351
but of course she didn't do anything.

159
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.625
Mia? You seriously don't like her?

160
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.541
She's, like, the nicest person
I've ever met.

161
00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:49.416
Yeah, well, she's a toddler.
She just goes around smiling.

162
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.261
You shouldn't walk around grinning
if your job is watching people die,

163
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.041
and your brother is stuck here
with this horrible noise.

164
00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.375
Here.

165
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:59.875
Help me up,
I'm gonna stick my head up here.

166
00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.041
See what the fuck is going on.

167
00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.125
Mom!

168
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.958
For the love of God, Doris,
come over here.

169
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.361
- You're going to fall.
- Well, then you make sure I don't.

was trying to murder her,
I had to come here and do something.

You know, she's basically already dead.

And what if it was you
in there instead of her?

00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.375
I mean, this is going to sound horrible,

511
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.458
but... yeah.

512
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.125
Once your brother's gone, he's gone...

513
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.666
and he is never coming back.
And you will miss taking care of him.

514
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.458
- [Doris] No, I won't.
- [Paul] You will.

515
00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:52.000
[Paul] You'll miss everything.
All the good, all the bad...

516
00:33:52.708 --> 00:33:54.333
Hell, especially the bad.

517
00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:01.000
I'd give anything to hear my wife yell
at me for letting the mosquitoes inside.

518
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.750
Just talk to her, you know?

519
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:11.583
Well, I haven't talked
to my brother in years.

520
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:13.666
He's not really aware.

521
00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:16.583
[Paul] Well, you should talk to him.

522
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:22.500
When they go, suddenly you got
all this important shit to say to 'em.

523
00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:26.208
Or not important shit. You just want to...

524
00:34:27.583 --> 00:34:29.875
Just want to tell 'em stuff.

525
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.083
Hi.

526
00:35:28.583 --> 00:35:30.041
[students chattering]

527
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:32.708
- [Laci] Look at Nate. Such a dork.
- [Megan] Aw, Nate.

528
00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:36.666
[Brittany] Oh, my God. What is that?
Are you dancing?

529
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.708
Hey, don't hate on my moves. Okay?
I was killin' that.

530
00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:42.791
Oh, Doris, come here.

531
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:46.642
- [Laci] Hey, girl.
- [Doris] Hey.

532
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:49.958
- These are from your party.
- That shit was off the chain.

533
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:54.041
Oh, really? Thanks. I had fun too.

534
00:35:54.125 --> 00:35:57.166
Hey, so my birthday is this weekend.

535
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.375
Could we maybe have
another party at your house?

536
00:36:00.583 --> 00:36:03.583
Well, my mom won't be home, so...

537
00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:06.083
- Yeah, definitely.
- Amazing.

538
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:07.375
Wait, do you smoke weed?

539
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:08.625
Oh...

540
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:15.333
Not right now.
But I'm thinking about starting soon.

541
00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:20.208
Yeah, I do.

542
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:21.291
[Brittany] Cool.

543
00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:22.833
[Brittany] Oh, my God.

544
00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:24.375
[upbeat music]

545
00:36:27.458 --> 00:36:29.041
Oh, my God.

546
00:36:30.458 --> 00:36:32.578
[Megan] Do we need to, like,
take you to the hospital?

547
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:36.583
Oh, guess who texted me last night?

548
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:38.166
Oh, my God. Aaron Miller?

549
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.250
- [Brittany] Correct.
- [Doris] Who?

550
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:41.833
You don't know Aaron Miller?

551
00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:44.166
- No.
- Do you not, like, live in this town?

552
00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.184
[Brittany] He's a few years older than us.

553
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:48.125
He's so hot.

554
00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:50.250
- Ew.
- Ew.

555
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.500
He is, he is.

556
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:55.041
We dated for almost a year, but...

557
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:58.916
he broke it off last month
because he said, I'm, like...

558
00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:01.958
like, immature.

559
00:37:02.416 --> 00:37:05.833
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

560
00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:09.958
I feel like only a really immature person
would be callous enough

561
00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:11.458
to call someone else immature.

562
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.750
Holy shit.

563
00:37:15.958 --> 00:37:17.583
You're so right.

564
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:22.416
Wow. I've, like, never
thought about it like that.

565
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.791
Yeah, that was, like,
some deep shit, Doris.

566
00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.750
Ooh, Deep Doris.

567
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.125
Okay. Well, Deep Doris,
you just earned yourself a keg stand.

568
00:37:35.208 --> 00:37:36.291
What?

569
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:38.625
- You don't know what a keg stand is?
- No.

570
00:37:38.708 --> 00:37:41.083
Oh, my God, you're like an alien.

571
00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:44.583
[Brittany] Dude, you asked me
if cheese was a vegetable

572
00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:46.625
- and you're calling her an alien?
- No!

573
00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:48.791
No, that was, like, five years ago.

574
00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:51.291
- That was not five years ago.
- Yes, it was.

575
00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:53.125
- More like months.
- It was five...

576
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.041
So, this is going to be so much fun.

577
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:02.583
Just put your hands right here...
and trust them.

578
00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:04.833
It'll be fun, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.

579
00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:06.333
[Doris] Oh, my God!

580
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.958
[all] One, two, three...

581
00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:40.458
[Brittany] What?

582
00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:46.375
What?

583
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:51.166
What the fuck is he doing?
Run, you dumbass!

584
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:55.916
- Okay. Guess what I heard?
- What?

585
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.416
Nate has a crush on Doris.

586
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.375
What? Yeah, right.

587
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:01.625
- No way.
- Wait. Where'd you hear that?

588
00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:04.000
[Brittany] Aw, that's so hot.

589
00:39:04.083 --> 00:39:07.166
The two of you together,
I would die of horniness.

590
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.666
- But who told you that?
- Do you like him?

591
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.541
I don't know.

592
00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:14.291
Oh, if you do, I can, like,
totally make it happen.

593
00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:19.250
Yeah. I mean, he's not all, like,
deep and quiet or whatever like you are,

594
00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:22.083
but he's a little panty melter, right?

595
00:39:22.958 --> 00:39:25.083
I mean, he's sort of cute.

596
00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:26.916
Oh, my God.

597
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.280
- She loves him.
- She loves him.

598
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.791
You love him.

599
00:39:31.125 --> 00:39:34.291
- You should go to prom with him.
- What? Okay, yeah.

600
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:36.708
Now that that's out there,
you're going with him.

601
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.666
I'm sorry. You're going. You have to.

602
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.875
Yeah, but don't get her hopes up because
he might not, like, actually be into her.

603
00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:45.625
Ew.

604
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:48.625
You sound really jealous, and it's boring.

605
00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:50.041
So boring.

606
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:53.916
[Laci] Can I put some gel in your hair?

607
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.958
Oh, I hate my hair.
I don't know what to do with it.

608
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:58.875
You should straighten that shit.

609
00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:01.208
I would, like, kill myself
if I had curly hair.

610
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:03.291
Well, I wish you had curly hair.

611
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:06.666
Where's your gel? I want to mess with it.

612
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.500
My mom might have some
in the bathroom closet.

613
00:40:09.583 --> 00:40:10.583
Okay.

614
00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:16.625
Oh, no, not in there.

615
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.333
Whoa...

616
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.333
Why do you have, like, a hospital in here?

617
00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:25.041
It's for my brother.

618
00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:27.541
He was sick for a long time, so...

619
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.875
That's, like, heavy shit.

620
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.250
[Laci] Did he, like, die?

621
00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:35.875
[Doris] No. But he is at Suncoast Hospice.

622
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:38.958
[Brittany] Shut up. With Terri Schiavo?

623
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:41.708
[Megan] That is so cool.
Wait, like, do you, like, know her?

624
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.583
Wait, can you get us on the news?

625
00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:45.625
[Brittany] Can I have one of these?

626
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:47.333
[Doris] Sure.

627
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:49.416
Tight.

628
00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:59.291
- [Megan] Guys, this is so sad.
- [Brittany] I know. You want one?

629
00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:00.375
[Megan] Yeah.

630
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:03.583
All right. I will see you later.

631
00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:05.291
[Doris] Wait. Can you take me home?

632
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.625
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to go home.

633
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:15.333
You're home alone too much.

634
00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:20.458
[Mom] He needs visitors. He needs family.

635
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:23.125
And he shouldn't be alone with Mia.

636
00:41:23.666 --> 00:41:26.333
I honestly... I think she's a sociopath.

637
00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:31.416
I saw her pushing a dead body
down the hallway, whistling showtunes.

638
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.041
Oh, God, don't pout.

639
00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:40.541
Look, I'll...
I'll take you home after my shift.

640
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:45.166
You really should spend some time
with him while you can.

641
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:50.750
All right, sweetheart.

642
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:55.958
I'm going to work, and I'll be back here
as soon as I can, okay?

643
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:01.208
All right.

644
00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:06.208
[laughing]

645
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.708
I didn't say that.

646
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.791
[kids clamoring]

647
00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:16.208
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

648
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:18.291
All right, never have I ever...

649
00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:21.333
waxed my pubes.

650
00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:24.083
- You're such a freakin' dick.
- Wow.

651
00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:26.125
[Nate] Don't hate me, hate the game.

652
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:27.791
[Brittany] The game?

653
00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:33.791
Dare.

654
00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:36.666
I dare...

655
00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:40.041
- all the boys to...
- You can't do that.

656
00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.101
- It's got to be one person.
- Kyle, Kyle, shut up.

657
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.041
Okay, it's fine.

658
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.875
Thank you. Thank you.

659
00:42:45.958 --> 00:42:49.250
I dare all the boys to...

660
00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:52.041
to take off their clothes.

661
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:55.833
I just stood up for her too.

662
00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:57.416
That's crazy, that's crazy.

663
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.000
- Ah.
- Evening, ma'am.

664
00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:06.166
Look who it is. My hero.

665
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:12.458
Listen, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but no visitors are allowed tonight.

666
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:16.001
[officer] The judge just set a date
to remove her feeding tube. So we're...

667
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:19.208
I don't give a shit what he did,
I'm going to go to sleep next to my son.

668
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:22.833
[officer] I can't let you do that.
No one is allowed in until morning.

669
00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:25.291
Why? What is the problem?

670
00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:27.434
What? You think I'm going to
sneak Schiavo a sandwich?

671
00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:28.791
- I'm going.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

672
00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:32.333
Ma'am, I will have to place you
under arrest if you do not cooperate.

673
00:43:34.583 --> 00:43:36.291
Are you kidding me?

674
00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:43.875
Look, I...

675
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.250
I think we got off on the wrong foot here,

676
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:52.166
and I understand
you're just following orders, but...

677
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.541
Ma'am, there's nothing I can do.

678
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:57.000
Look, my son, he is by himself
in that place right now.

[Sweet'N Low] Yes, I do.

850
00:56:49.708 --> 00:56:50.791
Thank you.

851
00:56:52.666 --> 00:56:53.666
Dor?

852
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:56.333
- How much are they?
- A hundred.

853
00:56:57.416 --> 00:56:58.958
I don't have that right now.

854
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:00.666
[Doris] Thank you, anyway.

855
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:03.958
Yeah.

856
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.500
[Sweet'N Low] I'mma get you.

857
00:57:14.458 --> 00:57:16.291
It's about to expire.
You can just have it.

858
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:17.500
Pro bono.

859
00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:20.708
Oh, Doris, that's perfect.

860
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:24.416
Okay.

861
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.708
Yeah. Thank you, Sweet'N Low.

862
00:57:30.333 --> 00:57:32.125
- [Brittany] Bye.
- [Doris] Bye, guys.

863
00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:35.166
[officer] Hey, there.
You mind popping the trunk for me?

864
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.958
They were just dropping me off.
They're leaving now.

865
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.517
- [Megan] See you tomorrow.
- [Nate] Peace.

866
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.021
[Megan] Can't believe she lives here.

867
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.041
Get in. You're driving me to the store.

868
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:48.333
Seriously? You're letting me drive?

869
00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:51.333
Yeah. This isn't for you.
I'm sick of driving.

870
00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:55.333
What are you waiting for? Come on.

871
00:58:03.583 --> 00:58:07.500
Okay, normal girl. Show me what you got.

872
00:58:10.166 --> 00:58:15.250
Um. Don't freak out,
'cause I, like, know the answer, but...

873
00:58:16.416 --> 00:58:18.541
which pedal's go and which is stop?

874
00:58:19.916 --> 00:58:21.166
Are you serious?

875
00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:24.208
Get the hell out of my car.

876
00:58:33.625 --> 00:58:36.625
[Paul] Okay, first things first.
What's first?

877
00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:40.500
Seatbelt?

878
00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:42.375
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you right now.

879
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:47.041
I think I'm going to cry. Yes. Seatbelt.
Put the seatbelt on.

880
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.750
Good. Now, second thing.

881
00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:56.125
You want to make sure
that your mirrors are in the right place.

882
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:59.375
So can you see out the back? This one?

883
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.375
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

884
00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:05.298
Now, what about the side mirrors?
Can you see everything to either side?

885
00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:07.083
[Doris] Yeah.

886
00:59:07.166 --> 00:59:11.583
[Paul] Now you take your foot off the
brake and hit the gas on the right.

887
00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:13.500
Right there. Yeah. Hit it.

888
00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:16.416
Good. Go. Good. Okay. You gotta steer.

889
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.250
[Paul] You gotta steer. Are you steering?

890
00:59:18.333 --> 00:59:19.541
[happy music plays]

891
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:20.726
[Paul] Good, good. You're doing good.

892
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.416
La, la, la... Over, over, over.

893
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.500
Okay, Just stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

894
00:59:26.083 --> 00:59:27.333
Stop.

895
00:59:27.416 --> 00:59:30.083
Okay, good.
You've got the brakes worked out.

896
00:59:31.708 --> 00:59:33.791
Now go easy. Just take it easy.

897
00:59:33.875 --> 00:59:37.041
You don't have to press down
so hard on the gas, but...

898
00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:39.333
Okay, watch out for that shed.

899
00:59:39.416 --> 00:59:40.875
Oh, whoa, whoa. Okay.

900
00:59:40.958 --> 00:59:43.208
Try to avoid... To the left.

901
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.041
[Paul] Just steer to the right.
To the right.

902
00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:51.166
Okay, now turn... Left, left. Get around.

903
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.875
Okay, no, but you don't have to go.
Watch out for the barrel!

904
00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.250
Watch out for the barrel!

905
00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:57.083
[happy music continues]

906
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.750
Look, it's not even an expensive car, but...

907
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.333
- I'm sorry.
- You know, it runs.

908
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:08.333
[Paul] Just try to go straight. You don't
have to go to the right or to the left.

909
01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:11.416
Good. Good. Nice and slow. Straight.

910
01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.833
Bravo.

911
01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.958
This is good driving.

912
01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.851
- [Paul] Good. Okay, stop, stop.
- [Doris] Which way?

913
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.333
[Paul] Yeah. Toward us.

914
01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:29.500
Oh, thank you, God. Thank you for letting
me live through this.

915
01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.083
[gentle music]

916
01:01:15.416 --> 01:01:18.250
[birds chirping]

917
01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:24.583
[Sue] Oh, good morning.

918
01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.541
How are you doing?

919
01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.333
I'm okay.

920
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.416
I just...

921
01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:52.583
I keep thinking about
when I was pregnant with my son.

922
01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:56.041
There was this anticipation.

923
01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:58.125
I was waiting because he was...

924
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.666
arriving at any moment, and I wondered...

925
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.250
what would he be like?

926
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:07.541
What would he bring into my life?

927
01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.458
But now I'm waiting for him to leave.

928
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:17.625
And I wonder,
what is he going to take from my life?

929
01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.625
It's kind of funny.

930
01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:26.375
It must be very hard.

931
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.250
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

932
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.958
[Mom] Since we're the only people out
here...

933
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.250
[Sue] Makes sense.

934
01:02:48.666 --> 01:02:51.333
I've been the mom
of a sick kid for so many years,

935
01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:53.875
I don't know
who I'm gonna be when he's gone.

936
01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:57.833
Do you have any other children?

937
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.416
No.

938
01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:07.333
Oh, my God. Yes. Yes. Christ. Yes.

939
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:11.375
Of course. Of course,
I have another child.

940
01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.750
I don't know,
I don't know why I just said that.

941
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.875
No, I have a daughter.

942
01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:22.333
[Sue] Well, she'll still be here
after he's gone.

943
01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:29.125
Life will still be here after he's gone.
It's just going to look different.

944
01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.750
[teacher] Then in 2003,
they were removed again.

945
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:37.101
[Nate] We're going out tonight, yes?

946
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.958
One billion percent.

947
01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:41.583
I just pray my mom goes to sleep
so I can sneak out.

948
01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:44.000
[Brittany] She will.
You gotta think positive.

949
01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:46.291
[teacher] Brittany. What's your opinion?

950
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.250
A... bout what?

951
01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:52.458
[teacher] Terri Schiavo, the person
we've been discussing all morning?

952
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.541
Right. Yeah.
Full disclosure, I haven't been listening.

953
01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:04.750
But I will say I just think
the whole Schiavo thing is just gross.

954
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.290
[teacher] And why is that?

955
01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.458
Because people should be allowed to die.

956
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:11.381
Like she told her husband to let her die
if she ever ended up like that.

957
01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:14.416
And all these nosy-ass people
just need to respect her wishes.

958
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.833
[teacher] I didn't ask you,
but thank you, Laci.

959
01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:21.458
I mean, you really should be asking Doris.

960
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.041
She, like, basically knows Terri Schiavo.

961
01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.875
[Laci] Yeah, her brother's in hospice
with Schiavo right now.

962
01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.166
Who's Doris?

963
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.291
I am.

964
01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.958
You don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to, Doris.

965
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.208
No, it's okay.

966
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:40.583
It's just, it's sort of hard
to talk about it like this.

967
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.250
Like, the way we talk
about stuff in this class.

968
01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.291
What do you mean?

969
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.666
Just, like, I don't know...

970
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.500
We sit here and we talk
about hypothetical situations

971
01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:52.375
and what the right or wrong action is,

972
01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.583
but you can't really answer
those questions 'cause you don't know.

973
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.810
You don't know what's right or wrong
until it's happening to you.

974
01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:02.291
Like, we can say Terri's husband is
a monster for wanting to let her die,

975
01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:04.583
or her parents are monsters
for wanting her to live.

976
01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:06.875
But we don't know, do we?

977
01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.625
Because we're not them.

978
01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:14.500
I guess you don't know
what's ethical... until you know.

979
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.666
[school bell rings]

980
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.166
That was so dope.

981
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.583
[Laci] So smart, Doris.

982
01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.833
[Brittany] See you, tonight, baby.

983
01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:41.208
- Doris.
- Hmm?

984
01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.500
I just want to say I...

985
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I know it's hard
sleeping here every night.

986
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:52.541
And I know you're a good kid.

987
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.458
I mean, the whole
party thing was partly my fault,

988
01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:59.083
I shouldn't have left you home alone.

989
01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.916
Okay.

990
01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:06.958
Thank you.

991
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.416
[phone buzzes]

992
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.500
Man, I'm so tired.

993
01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:23.583
Night, Mom.

994
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.208
You know...

995
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.416
if you forget how tragic this place is,

996
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.791
it's... almost like
we're having a slumber party.

997
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:37.583
Yep.

998
01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:41.750
Remember when you were little?

999
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:49.000
We'd build forts in the living room,
and you'd always yell, "Slumber party!"

1000
01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.416
We're going to have fun again, you and me,

1001
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:07.166
when this is over, I'll...

1002
01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.750
I'll learn how to be fun again.

1003
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.583
Mom, you should really get some sleep.
You've been working so hard.

1004
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.708
Okay. Okay.

1005
01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:29.375
Jeez. Goodnight.

1006
01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.291
[Laci] I believe in psychics.

1007
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.875
- [Brittany] What?
- [Laci] I do.

1008
01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:08.208
- [Laci] Oh, my God, she made it out.
- [Brittany] Holy crap.

1009
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:10.500
[Brittany] I am legit scared of your mom.

1010
01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:13.708
I was like, "That bitch is gonna
run out here and stab us."

1011
01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:17.041
[Laci] Here, I brought you an outfit,
but one of the boot heels is broken,

1012
01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:20.250
so just, like, don't dance too hard
or you'll fully face plant.

1013
01:08:20.333 --> 01:08:22.416
Got it. Thank you.

1014
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.000
[Brittany] Okay, so Nate and Megan
are meeting us there.

1015
01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.916
- Oh, and Cody.
- Oh, have you met him yet?

1016
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.726
- [Doris] No.
- [Brittany] You're going to hate him.

1017

Well, whatever you want to do,
I support you.

1021

I just want you to be happy.

That is what a real friend looks like.

Whatever. Easy for you to say, Doris.

You haven't been dealing
with this shit for four years.

Four years?

1026
01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:51.541
No, it's not four years,
it's actually three.

1027
01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:52.791
'Cause the first year,

1028
01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:54.601
- he was not an asshole.
- What are you talking about?

1029
01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:57.750
When I first started dating Cody,
he was such a sweetheart.

1030
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.416
I would do anything to go back.

1031

[Brittany] You were just brainwashed.

1032

- No, girl, we're fine.

Duh.

1040
01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:36.708
I gotta go to the DMV
and get a new one 'cause...

'cause that's where I got that one.

a lot of young people here. So...
