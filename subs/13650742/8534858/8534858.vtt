00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.000
<i>- It's really hot out.
- It is hot out, but it's nice.</i>

2
00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.833
<i>I'm so excited to go to school.
I'm sad to leave this, though.</i>

3
00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:44.750
<i>Boys, boys, boys, boys...
Brand new boys.</i>

4
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.625
<i>You'll probably find
some pretty boys in Santa Barbara.</i>

5
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.083
<i>Yeah, I think I'm going to be on
the lookout for hot water polo players.</i>

6
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.166
<i>Nice.</i>

7
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.250
<i>I'm going to get something to drink.</i>

8
00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:58.958
<i>- Yeah, I'll go with you. I'm really hot.
- Yeah, let's go inside. I'm frying.</i>

9
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.726
<i>And the debate continues
over the life of Terri Schiavo,</i>

10
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.375
<i>who's right here in Tampa Bay...</i>

11
00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:06.625
<i>Forty-one-year-old Schiavo
has had her feeding tube...</i>

12
00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:10.958
<i>Tammy, Howard, Angie,
my make-up artist Lisa, my trainer...</i>

13
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.375
<i>Even Sugar Pie was driving me crazy.</i>

14
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.250
<i>Sugar Pie. Sugar Pie!</i>

15
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.583
<i>Sugar Pie! Sugar Pie.</i>

16
00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:24.333
Oh, God, I can't stand
looking at that poor woman.

17
00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.708
Hey. Hi.

18
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:33.125
<i>Let's give it up
for Anna Nicole Smith.</i>

19
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:36.583
My head is killing me,
and this isn't helping.

20
00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.208
<i>I was so embarrassed, and...</i>

21
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.083
I got you nachos.

22
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.833
<i>Sugar Pie! Shut up...</i>

23
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.833
- Well, did you give him his shot?
- Yes, I did.

24
00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.500
Did you vacuum?

25
00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.208
- Yeah.
- Doesn't look like it.

26
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.291
'Cause the carpet's a thousand years old.

27
00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.708
God, this place really has
turned into a shit hole.

28
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.165
I'm going to need your help
with him in the morning.

29
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.708
I can't. I'll miss the van.

30
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.208
Oh, Doris, it's a big day.
You don't have to go to school.

31
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.583
But I want to go.

32
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.250
- You'll be late and I'll write you a note.
- No, please, Mom.

33
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.000
I'll have to interrupt class
and everyone looks at me...

34
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.083
It's really embarrassing.

35
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.833
Oh it's really embarrassing. Oh, well...

36
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:38.559
Oh, well, then I guess I'll just have to
drop your brother off by myself,

37
00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.059
because God forbid,
you should be embarrassed.

38
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:41.458
Okay, fine. I'll come. Forget it.

39
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.166
No? Oh, are you sure?

40
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.125
You sure? Because I wouldn't want you
to blush in front of your friends.

41
00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:49.125
I don't have any friends.
And fine, I said forget it.

42
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.375
<i>Sugar Pie,
shut the up.</i>

43
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:02.708
Okay. One, two, three. Go.

44
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:05.083
Oh, my God. Okay.

45
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.125
- Lift him up.
- I'm trying.

46
00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:08.375
Come on.

47
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm taking her today.

48
00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:16.250
You can go.

49
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:21.791
What is he? Deaf?

50
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.875
Mom, stop yelling.
He obviously can't hear you.

51
00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958
Okay.

52
00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.166
Hello?

53
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.625
I'm taking her. You can go!

54
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.625
- Drive away!
- Mom, stop yelling.

55
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.291
Everyone is staring at us.

56
00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:40.458
Okay, lift his upper body.
Up, here we go.

57
00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:43.416
There we go. That's good.

58
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.708
All right, sweetheart. Sorry.

59
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.041
I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.416
Can I drive?

61
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.340
What? No, no, no, no.
We don't have time.

62
00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.375
- Come on, you never let me...
- Doris!

63
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.458
Please, not today.

64
00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:57.833
Okay.

65
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.250
All right.

66
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.875
Get in the back!

67
00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.041
- What?
- The latch has been screwy.

68
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.851
You got to make sure
his chair doesn't fall out.

69
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.250
My hair is gonna go nuts.

70
00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.083
Your hair?

71
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.333
Goddamn piece of crap.

72
00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.208
For fuck's sake.

73
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:55.208
Excuse me. If you don't mind
I just need to check your bags.

74
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.541
Why?

75
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.767
Unfortunately,
the staff gets a lot of threats

76
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:01.791
since Mrs. Schiavo got here.

77
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.601
So you think while I'm dropping
my son off, I'm going to kill someone?

78
00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.333
Just let her check your bags.

79
00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:10.291
Hi, there. Is everything okay?
I'm Mia, the Director of Nursing.

80
00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:12.833
- You're the Director? How old are you?
- Mom!

81
00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:14.791
- It's okay.
- What? It's just a question.

82
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:17.750
How old are you?
'Cause you do. You look young.

83
00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.541
I actually get that a lot.

84
00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:24.000
Don't worry about your bags.

85
00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:26.083
If you both want to follow me,
I can check you in.

86
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.833
This way.

87
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.416
I can't believe that teenager
just shoved us in here.

88
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.000
Look at this. Look!

89
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.541
Look at this.

90
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:51.125
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm going to clean this place up.

91
00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:53.333
This room is way cleaner than our house.

92
00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.208
I don't know if this...

93
00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.726
Do you think this is
the right place for him?

94
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.333
I just... I'm not so sure.

95
00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:02.500
You'd say that about any place.

96
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:04.875
Are you not at all upset about this?

97
00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.500
This is it, Doris.

98
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.125
This filthy box is where
your brother's going to die.

99
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.791
Of course I'm upset.

100
00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.833
Can we go soon? I'm already really late.

101
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:20.583
You know, you could just try and think
about someone other than yourself.

102
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.041
You might like it.

103
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.583
Brad and Jen just broke up.

104
00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.892
Right now I'm thinking about them.

105
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.458
Oh, they did?

106
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I knew they would.

107
00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:32.875
The second they got married.
What did I say?

108
00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.638
- He's too handsome.
- "He's too handsome."

109
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.541
The handsome ones never stay.

110
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:40.541
Like your brother.

111
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.666
Too handsome for this world.

112
00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:47.333
Can we go now, please?

113
00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:01.333
Welcome back, Doris. Thank you.

114
00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:08.333
Dude, she said it was a
one-time thing, like, I don't know.

115
00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:09.625
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:12.208
You seriously think
Cody's hooking up with Tiffany?

117
00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:15.208
I know for a fact he did
and good riddance.

118
00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.416
Let her keep his dirty dick.

119
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.976
He is not
hooking up with Tiffany.

120
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.166
Bullshit.
Tiffany told me herself.

121
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.000
She showed me a hickey.
It was shaped like Cody's dirty mouth.

122
00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.892
Okay, well,
y'all should come over later.

123
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:28.184
Okay, we're gonna grill by the pool
and Cody will be there,

124
00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:29.625
so you can just ask him yourself.

125
00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:31.375
Okay. Cody's going to be there?

126
00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:35.083
Yes, you best believe my ass will be there
'cause I'm done with these rumors.

127
00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:37.846
Okay. Sounds like
most of us are done with the assignment.

128
00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:43.041
So let's talk about being naked in public.

129
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.625
Is that an ethics question?

130
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:48.708
Yes, Adam.

131
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:51.291
Well, that depends on
the laws of the land.

132
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:52.458
Exactly.

133
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:57.166
Banning public nudity is a rule
of a particular society, our society,

134
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.250
especially this classroom.

135
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.375
But what about Christian ethics?

136
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:04.458
How do they differ
from the law of the land?

137
00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:10.500
Whoa, what's your hurry?
Am I that boring?

138
00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:15.916
Oh, excuse me.

139
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.416
Yeah, okay.

140
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:23.291
Do you hear it? It's like...

141
00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:26.000
It's got to be driving him insane.

142
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:30.375
Do not worry, honey.
I'm going to fix this.

143
00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:31.625
I doubt he hears it.

144
00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:33.625
Here, get up. I need your chair.

145
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.791
Of course... I told that robot
at the front desk,

146
00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:40.351
but of course she didn't do anything.

147
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.625
Mia? You seriously don't like her?

148
00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.541
She's, like, the nicest person
I've ever met.

149
00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:49.416
Yeah, well, she's a toddler.
She just goes around smiling.

150
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.261
You shouldn't walk around grinning
if your job is watching people die,

151
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.041
and your brother is stuck here
with this horrible noise.

152
00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.375
Here.

153
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:59.875
Help me up,
I'm gonna stick my head up here.

154
00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.041
See what the fuck is going on.

155
00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.125
Mom!

156
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.958
For the love of God, Doris,
come over here.

157
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.361
- You're going to fall.
- Well, then you make sure I don't.

158
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.125
Can you please just hurry up?

159
00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:13.726
Quiet. I can't hear it
when you're talking?

160
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.500
- Everything okay in here?
- No, no, it is not okay in here.

161
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:21.125
My son is a prisoner here
and he's been tortured by that noise.

162
00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:24.916
There's barely a noise.

163
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.416
You don't hear that?

164
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:31.083
Whatever. I'm sorry about her.

165
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.958
She's a lunatic.

166
00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:39.833
Thank you.

Cheeseburger, fries
and a chocolate shake,

184
00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.958
That's 9.68.

185
00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.666
Oh, forget the shake.

186
00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:59.125
Keep the shake. I got it.
Add fish and chips for me.

187
00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.166
Thank you. That's so nice of you
but you really don't...

188
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.666
No, no, no buts. You take the food,
you're skinny as a rail.

189
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.375
I bet you can't even see your shadow.

190
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:16.125
- Okay, well, thank you again.
- Yup. Yup, yup.

191
00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.833
Well, mind if I join?

192
00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:28.125
Yeah.

193
00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:33.458
I mean, no, no, I don't mind if...
Yeah, you can sit here, if you want.

194
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.791
I think I saw you over at that
executional chamber.

195
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:44.916
Suncoast?

196
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.083
- Yeah.
- Yeah. My brother's living there.

197
00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:50.291
Or... dying there.

198
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:52.333
Oh, I'm so sorry.

199
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.791
Well, I'll pray for his recovery.

200
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:57.041
Oh, please don't.

201
00:13:58.916 --> 00:14:01.916
I just mean he has brain cancer

202
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and he's blind and he can't walk,
and he hasn't talked in years.

203
00:14:06.083 --> 00:14:08.625
I mean, like, his brain
just doesn't really function anymore.

204
00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:12.583
Like, he still eats on his own,
but not for long.

205
00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:17.041
So if he survived, I just...
don't think he'd be happy.

206
00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:19.208
Still...

207
00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.375
every life is precious.

208
00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:31.208
I do not know why I just laughed.
It's obviously not funny.

209
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:33.208
Sorry,

210
00:14:33.291 --> 00:14:35.958
I haven't, like, talked to
another person in a long time.

211
00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:40.541
I've just been taking care of my brother
and haven't had time to really, like,

212
00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:42.166
talk to anyone.

213
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:47.958
Well, maybe you shouldn't start now
'cause you're pretty bad at it.

214
00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:52.291
- Oh, yay.
- Thank you.

215
00:14:57.833 --> 00:15:00.416
- Not a fan?
- Oh, sorry.

216
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.708
Just the smell of seafood
kinda grosses me out.

217
00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:05.916
Well, maybe you haven't smelled
the right seafood.

218
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.041
- Maybe not.
- No, definitely not.

219
00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:11.083
Have you been to West Palm Beach?

220
00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:13.541
- No.
- Wooh whee!

221
00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:15.208
You're gonna love West Palm Beach.

222
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:18.916
Go to Captain Joe's.
Best fish tacos in the world.

223
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.833
- Grouper. You'll love it.
- I doubt it.

224
00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.166
My wife was obsessed with them.

225
00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:31.791
She passed away.

226
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.000
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:36.791
Me too.

228
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:40.625
My dad died.
He had a heart attack when I was three.

229
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:45.750
Christ, it ain't a competition.
But if it was, you'd be winning.

230
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:51.791
Hey, yeah. Paul.

231
00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:54.125
- Doris.
- Doris?

232
00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:56.208
Really? Old lady's name.

233
00:15:56.291 --> 00:15:57.791
It was my grandma's name.

234
00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.875
- Oh.
- She died the day I was born.

235
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:03.375
My God. Is there any conversation with you

236
00:16:03.458 --> 00:16:05.833
that it's not, like,
thoroughly depressing?

237
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.041
Basically, everyone in my family is dead,
except my mom.

238
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.125
But I sometimes kind of wish she was.

239
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:13.875
Don't say that.

240
00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.750
- I'm... I'm kidding.
- Yeah, well, that's not funny.

241
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:21.083
Every life is precious,
including your mother's.

242
00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:23.791
No one has ever called my mom precious.

243
00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:26.541
Oh, God.

244
00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:32.458
Jesus, Doris.

245
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:35.250
I've been looking everywhere for you.
What? You just walk off?

246
00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:36.666
You don't answer your phone.

247
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.041
- Hello?
- Mom, this is Paul.

248
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.125
Nice to meet you.

249
00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:44.625
- Hi.
- Hi.

250
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.625
Let's go. I'm gonna be late for work.

251
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:52.666
See? Isn't she precious?
It was nice meeting you.

252
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.726
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go...

253
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.000
- Can I drive?
- No. I just said I'm late.

254
00:17:04.708 --> 00:17:05.767
<i>...as Hurricane Zeta</i>

255
00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:08.291
<i>rips through
the Keys and up the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

256
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.625
<i>Fill up those gas tanks and generators
this could be a long weekend.</i>

257
00:17:13.291 --> 00:17:15.416
This storm could be a real bitch.

258
00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:19.375
You should board up the windows.

259
00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.541
<i>It's the first time
Jacksonville has ever hosted</i>

260
00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.250
<i>a Super Bowl at the Alltel Stadium...</i>

261
00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:27.041
I think I should start
sleeping at Suncoast

262
00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.916
so your brother doesn't get too lonely.

263
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.101
<i>...in an attempt to avoid
repeating a controversial incident...</i>

264
00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:32.250
But...

265
00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.416
then I'll be alone.

266
00:17:37.375 --> 00:17:39.375
You'll be in your own home.

267
00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:43.833
He's in a new place,
surrounded by strangers.

268
00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:45.583
- But I don't...
- You know, Doris...

269
00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:49.416
When you have your own kids,
you'll understand.

270
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:53.416
I just can't stand the idea of him
in that place by himself.

271
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.416
He's my child.

272
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.875
When he's in pain, I'm in pain.

273
00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:00.208
I'm your child, too.

274
00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:02.142
- For God's sake.
- What about my pain?

275
00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.291
Give me a break.

276
00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:05.041
What if the storm gets really bad?

277
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.583
And what if there's a blackout?
We don't have a generator.

278
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:09.746
Please, just will you think
about your brother?

279
00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:13.208
He's trapped in his own body.
He can't move, he can't see...

280
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.309
You're worried about using
a flashlight for one night?

281
00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:17.053
I'm going to be sleeping
on a cot for weeks.

282
00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:18.291
I said, fine.

283
00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:26.791
And because it is legal
in all 50 states, is it ethical?

284
00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:31.958
Do we blindly accept the ethics
of our government as our own?

285
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:33.041
No.

286
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.708
And we know abortion is wrong
because the Bible says it is.

287
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.851
That's actually not true, Adam.

288
00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:41.083
There is no
explicit prohibition of abortion

289
00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:43.791
in either the Old or the New Testament.

290
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:46.625
Okay, well, I still think it's wrong.

291
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.916
Well, I think you're an idiot.

292
00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:51.708
Ah, good. A debate.

293
00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:55.208
Why don't both of you come in on Monday
with your prepared arguments?

294
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:56.375
Love it.

295
00:18:57.208 --> 00:18:59.017
You should have
kept your mouth shut.

296
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:01.000
I'm a feminist, and I won't be silenced.

297
00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.833
Let's talk about bioethics...

298
00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:08.916
Well, Kyle's dad found out
he was going to throw a hurricane party.

299
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.666
Now his parents aren't going to evacuate.

300
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.208
What? That freakin' sucks balls.

301
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.041
Well, we have to go somewhere

302
00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:18.583
because I already told my parents
I'm going on an overnight field trip.

303
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:23.250
Seriously, though,
I really want to go out. Please?

304
00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.625
Can we go to Tara's?

305
00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:27.226
- Didn't she get her own place?
- She got evicted.

306
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.101
- Of course she did.
- Yeah.

307
00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.166
Marcus said he might get a keg
and go under the causeway.

308
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.708
Waves are going to be so big,
he's going to bail.

309
00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:38.333
- We can go to the movies.
- Yeah, right after I kill myself.

310
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.250
You can come to my house.

311
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.958
I mean, my mom won't be there,
and you can do whatever you want.

312
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:53.166
But if not, it's cool.

313
00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.750
I just thought
if you needed a place to party,

314
00:19:55.833 --> 00:20:01.000
you could totally come over.
Or whatever you want. It's chill.

315
00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:04.166
Yeah. Super chill.

316
00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:07.208
So there's, like, no adults?

317
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:11.041
- Can we roll?
- Sure. Whatever you want.

318
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:17.333
Wait. Guys, this is, like, so dope.
Oh, my God, I have to tell everybody.

319
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.250
But who are you?

320
00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:22.666
Yeah, yeah. What's your name?

321
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.125
Doris.

322
00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:26.500
Cool. Nate.

323
00:20:26.583 --> 00:20:28.916
Yeah, cool.

324
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.500
- Laci.
- Brittany.

325
00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:32.416
Cool. Doris.

326
00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:34.375

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:30.791
- Hi.
- Hey.

341
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:36.250
Oh, your house is so cute.

342
00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.333
It's super...

343
00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:41.833
homey and, like...

344
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:45.416
- very unique.
- Yeah.

345
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.083
Everyone says
this neighborhood is scary,

346
00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:52.750
but, like, when you're in it,
it's like, not that scary.

347
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.000
Thank you.

348
00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:57.583
Sorta smells like piss in here.

349
00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:03.416
Oh, that's probably from my cat

350
00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:06.875
who's just running around here somewhere.

351
00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:10.375
I have a cat.

352
00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:22.083
Cheers.

353
00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:05.291
Want one?

354
00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:07.500
Oh.

355
00:23:07.583 --> 00:23:11.583
Uh, uh... no. Thank you.

356
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.875
So you have a pool?

357
00:23:21.541 --> 00:23:23.333
- Huh?
- In class.

358
00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:25.125
I heard you say you have a pool.

359
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:28.625
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

360
00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:37.083
So, what do your parents do?

361
00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:40.083
What do you mean? Like their jobs?

362
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:42.208
Never mind.

363
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.083
- My mom has a parrot.
- Really?

364
00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:47.642
Yeah. Yeah, she got it to talk.

365
00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:49.666
She got it to say...

366
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.476
"I love you, Nate."

367
00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.708
Yeah, it was kind of weird at first,

368
00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:56.875
but now I sort of, like,
look forward to it.

369
00:23:57.833 --> 00:23:59.833
That's really sweet.

370
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:02.041
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:20.916
Doris, come sit. Come sit.
Come here. Come on.

372
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.333
This house is amazing.

373
00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:28.541
It's so... small.

374
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.541
It's like a doll house. It's incredible.

375
00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.791
You're so beautiful.

376
00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:38.000
- No.
- No, no, you are.

377
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:41.125
And you're just, like, so natural.

378
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:44.875
And your nose is just, like, so real.

379
00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:46.583
Beyond real.

380
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.375
You're like this... lion

381
00:24:50.458 --> 00:24:53.083
- Yes!
- ...with your wild hair.

382
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.833
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

383
00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:57.708
- She's a lion.
- She's a lion.

384
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.833
- Roar!
- Roar!

385
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:02.541
Roar!

386
00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:04.208
Roar with us.

387
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:06.083
Roar.

388
00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:07.541
Yeah!

389
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.583
- Good morning.
- Morning.

390
00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:58.750
You're here early.
We don't usually get visitors this early.

391
00:27:00.666 --> 00:27:03.291
Well, I slept here last night.

392
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:08.541
- My son is here.
- Well, he's lucky to have you.

393
00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:14.416
Well... what about you?

394
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.833
Does your family visit? I mean, I hope so.

395
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.750
I can't imagine only having
these fake nurses to talk to.

396
00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.833
No, I'm not.

397
00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:29.875
I'm not a patient. I work here.

398
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:34.500
Oh, Jesus Christ.

399
00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:36.375
Oh, I thought because...

400
00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:38.458
Oh, look, that... That is.

401
00:27:38.541 --> 00:27:41.333
- No, I'm not dying.
- That's my mistake.

402
00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:43.142
I guess I should have
put on lipstick this morning.

403
00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:47.625
No, I am so sorry.
That was a dumbass thing to say.

404
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:48.833
It's okay.

405
00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:53.458
I'm Sue. I'm the grief counselor here.

406
00:27:54.166 --> 00:27:58.333
And I'm available to talk
if you ever want to.

407
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.958
Oh.

408
00:28:02.916 --> 00:28:05.666
Oh, my son isn't dead,
so I'm not really grieving yet.

409
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.958
Okay, well...
I'm here if you change your mind.

410
00:28:12.083 --> 00:28:13.541
Okay.

411
00:28:17.708 --> 00:28:19.916
Well, I should get back...

412
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.958
- Sure. Yeah.
- ...to...

413
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:25.541
Yeah.

414
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.625
Shit.

415
00:28:43.958 --> 00:28:47.666
Hey, what are you doing with that?

416
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.291
I was just... moving it out of the way,

417
00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:55.958
'cause we don't need any more, right?

418
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.666
No, I guess not.

419
00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:04.375
How was the storm?

420
00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:08.625
Not bad. Sort of fun, actually.

421
00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:10.291
Fun?

422
00:29:10.625 --> 00:29:15.791
No, I didn't mean fun.
I didn't have fun because I was alone.

423
00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:20.666
So... There was a blackout,
and I lit some candles.

424
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.625
And... candles are fun.

425
00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:28.916
You're being weird.

426
00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:31.916
What? No, I'm not.

427
00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:44.166
It won't kill you to spend
a few hours with your brother.

428
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.041
But I spent six years with him,
and he has nurses taking care of him now.

429
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.208
Get out of the truck.

430
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.041
Excuse me, ma'am.

431
00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:57.666
I'm sorry, but we need to check
the back of your vehicle.

432
00:29:58.708 --> 00:29:59.875
For what?

433
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.375
Frankly, we received
a bomb threat yesterday,

434
00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:05.458
and we're taking it pretty seriously.

435
00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:09.958
Everyone in there is about to die anyway.
Who would waste a bomb on that place?

436
00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.583
Ignore her. Please, just do
whatever you need to do.

437
00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:16.708
It's unbelievable.

438
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.416
What's in the back there, ma'am?

439
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:34.000
Well, Officer... that is an oxygen tank.

440
00:30:35.541 --> 00:30:38.375
Because my son's cancer
spread to his lungs.

441
00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:41.208
Is that illegal?

442
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:44.083
Get out.

443
00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:48.166
I'm not staying any way,
I've got to get to work.

444
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.333
At the bomb factory...
where I make hospice bombs.

445
00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:25.625
Can I have one?

446
00:31:27.291 --> 00:31:28.500
How old are you?

447
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.583
Fine. I'll just go buy some.

448
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:35.375
You're so full of shit
your eyes are turning brown.

449
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:38.458
- My eyes are brown.
- Exactly.

450
00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:42.791
You go to Clearwater Christian?

451
00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:45.333
How do you know that?

452
00:31:46.583 --> 00:31:48.791
I know everything about you, Doris.

453
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:54.958
I'm kidding. It's on your shirt.

454
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.416
- Oh.
- Are you Christian?

455
00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:05.458
No, not exactly.

456
00:32:05.541 --> 00:32:07.500
My mom actually thinks
religion is bullshit.

457
00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:08.791
No offense.

458
00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:11.083
She just didn't want me
going to the public school

459
00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:13.291
after some kid shot a math teacher.

460
00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:15.708
So she has to work all the time
to pay my tuition.

461
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:17.541
She never shuts up about it.

462
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.000
She's a good mom.

463
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.000
Um... no.

464
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.083
To my brother, maybe, but not to me.

465
00:32:27.375 --> 00:32:30.125
You know,
Terri went to Catholic school.

466
00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:31.833
How do you know?

467
00:32:32.666 --> 00:32:35.166
- Just do.
- Do you know her?

468
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.916
- Well, no. I don't know her personally.
- What do you mean?

469
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.166
I don't know her.

470
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.958
But when I found out
that her psychotic husband

471
00:32:47.041 --> 00:32:51.666
was trying to murder her,
I had to come here and do something.

472
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:56.458
Murder her? But...
You know, she's basically already dead.

473
00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:59.625
She's as alive as you are.

474
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:03.416
And what if it was you
in there instead of her?

475
00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:10.708
Bottom line is, her husband
didn't want to take care of her anymore.

476
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.666
Honestly, I get that.

477
00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:18.208
It's really hard
taking care of sick people.

478
00:33:19.375 --> 00:33:20.666
Sometimes you need a break.

479
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.791
Are you enjoying your break?

480
00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:29.375
I mean, this is going to sound horrible,

481
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.458
but... yeah.

482
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.125
Once your brother's gone, he's gone...

483
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.666
and he is never coming back.
And you will miss taking care of him.

484
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.458
- No, I won't.
- You will.

485
00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:52.000
You'll miss everything.
All the good, all the bad...

486
00:33:52.708 --> 00:33:54.333
Hell, especially the bad.

487
00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:01.000
I'd give anything to hear my wife yell
at me for letting the mosquitoes inside.

488
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.750
Just talk to her, you know?

489
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:11.583
Well, I haven't talked
to my brother in years.

490
00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:13.666
He's not really aware.

491
00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:16.583
Well, you should talk to him.

492
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:22.500
When they go, suddenly you got
all this important shit to say to 'em.

493
00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:26.208
Or not important shit. You just want to...

494
00:34:27.583 --> 00:34:29.875
Just want to tell 'em stuff.

495
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.083
Hi.

496
00:35:30.125 --> 00:35:32.708
- Look at Nate. Such a dork.
- Aw, Nate.

497
00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:36.666
Oh, my God. What is that?
Are you dancing?

498
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.708
Hey, don't hate on my moves. Okay?
I was killin' that.

499
00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:42.791
Oh, Doris, come here.

500
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:46.642
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

501
00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:49.958
- These are from your party.
- That shit was off the chain.

502
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:54.041
Oh, really? Thanks. I had fun too.

503
00:35:54.125 --> 00:35:57.166
Hey, so my birthday is this weekend.

504
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.375
Could we maybe have
another party at your house?

505
00:36:00.583 --> 00:36:03.583
Well, my mom won't be home, so...

506
00:36:03.666 --> 00:36:06.083
- Yeah, definitely.
- Amazing.

507
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:07.375
Wait, do you smoke weed?

508
00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:08.625
Oh...

509
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:15.333
Not right now.
But I'm thinking about starting soon.

510
00:36:19.083 --> 00:36:20.208
Yeah, I do.

511
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:21.291
Cool.

512
00:36:21.375 --> 00:36:22.833
Oh, my God.

513
00:36:27.458 --> 00:36:29.041
Oh, my God.

514
00:36:30.458 --> 00:36:32.578
Do we need to, like,
take you to the hospital?

515
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:36.583
Oh, guess who texted me last night?

516
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:38.166
Oh, my God. Aaron Miller?

517
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.250
- Correct.
- Who?

518
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:41.833
You don't know Aaron Miller?

519
00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:44.166
- No.
- Do you not, like, live in this town?

520
00:36:44.625 --> 00:36:46.184
He's a few years older than us.

521
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:48.125
He's so hot.

522
00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:50.250
- Ew.
- Ew.

523
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.500
He is, he is.

524
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:55.041
We dated for almost a year, but...

525
00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:58.916
he broke it off last month
because he said, I'm, like...

526
00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:01.958
like, immature.

527
00:37:02.416 --> 00:37:05.833
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

528
00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:09.958
I feel like only a really immature person
would be callous enough

529
00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:11.458
to call someone else immature.

530
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.750
Holy shit.

531
00:37:15.958 --> 00:37:17.583
You're so right.

532
00:37:18.083 --> 00:37:22.416
Wow. I've, like, never
thought about it like that.

533
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.791
Yeah, that was, like,
some deep shit, Doris.

534
00:37:26.875 --> 00:37:28.750
Ooh, Deep Doris.

535
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.125
Okay. Well, Deep Doris,
you just earned yourself a keg stand.

536
00:37:35.208 --> 00:37:36.291
What?

537
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:38.625
- You don't know what a keg stand is?
- No.

538
00:37:38.708 --> 00:37:41.083
Oh, my God, you're like an alien.

539
00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:44.583
Dude, you asked me
if cheese was a vegetable

540
00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:46.625
- and you're calling her an alien?
- No!

541
00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:48.791
No, that was, like, five years ago.

542
00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:51.291
- That was not five years ago.
- Yes, it was.

543
00:37:51.375 --> 00:37:53.125
- More like months.
- It was five...

544
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.041
So, this is going to be so much fun.

545
00:37:59.125 --> 00:38:02.583
Just put your hands right here...
and trust them.

546
00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:04.833
It'll be fun, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.

547
00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:06.333
Oh, my God!

548
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.958
One, two, three...

549
00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:40.458
What?

550
00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:46.375
What?

551
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:51.166
What the fuck is he doing?
Run, you dumbass!

552
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:55.916
- Okay. Guess what I heard?
- What?

553
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.416
Nate has a crush on Doris.

554
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.375
What? Yeah, right.

555
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:01.625
- No way.
- Wait. Where'd you hear that?

556
00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:04.000
Aw, that's so hot.

557
00:39:04.083 --> 00:39:07.166
The two of you together,
I would die of horniness.

558
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.666
- But who told you that?
- Do you like him?

559
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.541
I don't know.

560
00:39:11.625 --> 00:39:14.291
Oh, if you do, I can, like,
totally make it happen.

561
00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:19.250
Yeah. I mean, he's not all, like,
deep and quiet or whatever like you are,

562
00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:22.083
but he's a little panty melter, right?

563
00:39:22.958 --> 00:39:25.083
I mean, he's sort of cute.

564
00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:26.916
Oh, my God.

565
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.280
- She loves him.
- She loves him.

566
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.791
You love him.

567
00:39:31.125 --> 00:39:34.291
- You should go to prom with him.
- What? Okay, yeah.

568
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:36.708
Now that that's out there,
you're going with him.

569
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.666
I'm sorry. You're going. You have to.

570
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.875
Yeah, but don't get her hopes up because
he might not, like, actually be into her.

571
00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:45.625
Ew.

572
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:48.625
You sound really jealous, and it's boring.

573
00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:50.041
So boring.

574
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:53.916
Can I put some gel in your hair?

575
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.958
Oh, I hate my hair.
I don't know what to do with it.

576
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:58.875
You should straighten that shit.

577
00:39:58.958 --> 00:40:01.208
I would, like, kill myself
if I had curly hair.

578
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:03.291
Well, I wish you had curly hair.

579
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:06.666
Where's your gel? I want to mess with it.

580
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.500
My mom might have some
in the bathroom closet.

581
00:40:09.583 --> 00:40:10.583
Okay.

582
00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:16.625
Oh, no, not in there.

583
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.333
Whoa...

584
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.333
Why do you have, like, a hospital in here?

585
00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:25.041
It's for my brother.

586
00:40:25.125 --> 00:40:27.541
He was sick for a long time, so...

587
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.875
That's, like, heavy shit.

588
00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.250
Did he, like, die?

589
00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:35.875
No. But he is at Suncoast Hospice.

590
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:38.958
Shut up. With Terri Schiavo?

591
00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:41.708
That is so cool.
Wait, like, do you, like, know her?

592
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:43.583
Wait, can you get us on the news?

593
00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:45.625
Can I have one of these?

594
00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:47.333
Sure.

595
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:49.416
Tight.

596
00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:59.291
- Guys, this is so sad.
- I know. You want one?

597
00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:00.375
Yeah.

598
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:03.583
All right. I will see you later.

599
00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:05.291
Wait. Can you take me home?

600
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.625
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to go home.

601
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:15.333
You're home alone too much.

602
00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:20.458
He needs visitors. He needs family.

603
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:23.125
And he shouldn't be alone with Mia.

604
00:41:23.666 --> 00:41:26.333
I honestly... I think she's a sociopath.

605
00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:31.416
I saw her pushing a dead body
down the hallway, whistling showtunes.

606
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.041
Oh, God, don't pout.

607
00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:40.541
Look, I'll...
I'll take you home after my shift.

608
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:45.166
You really should spend some time
with him while you can.

609
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:50.750
All right, sweetheart.

610
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:55.958
I'm going to work, and I'll be back here
as soon as I can, okay?

611
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:01.208
All right.

612
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:07.708
I didn't say that.

613
00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:16.208
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

614
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:18.291
All right, never have I ever...

615
00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:21.333
waxed my pubes.

616
00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:24.083
- You're such a freakin' dick.
- Wow.

617
00:42:24.166 --> 00:42:26.125
Don't hate me, hate the game.

618
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:27.791
The game?

619
00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:33.791
Dare.

620
00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:36.666
I dare...

621
00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:40.041
- all the boys to...
- You can't do that.

622
00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.101
- It's got to be one person.
- Kyle, Kyle, shut up.

623
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.041
Okay, it's fine.

624
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:45.875
Thank you. Thank you.

625
00:42:45.958 --> 00:42:49.250
I dare all the boys to...

626
00:42:49.708 --> 00:42:52.041
to take off their clothes.

627
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:55.833
I just stood up for her too.

628
00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:57.416
That's crazy, that's crazy.

629
00:43:00.833 --> 00:43:03.000
- Ah.
- Evening, ma'am.

630
00:43:03.083 --> 00:43:06.166
Look who it is. My hero.

631
00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:12.458
Listen, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but no visitors are allowed tonight.

632
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:16.001
The judge just set a date
to remove her feeding tube. So we're...

633
00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:19.208
I don't give a shit what he did,
I'm going to go to sleep next to my son.

634
00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:22.833
I can't let you do that.
No one is allowed in until morning.

635
00:43:22.916 --> 00:43:25.291
Why? What is the problem?

636
00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:27.434
What? You think I'm going to
sneak Schiavo a sandwich?

637
00:43:27.458 --> 00:43:28.791
- I'm going.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

638
00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:32.333
Ma'am, I will have to place you
under arrest if you do not cooperate.

639
00:43:34.583 --> 00:43:36.291
Are you kidding me?

640
00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:43.875
Look, I...

641
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.250
I think we got off on the wrong foot here,

642
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:52.166
and I understand
you're just following orders, but...

643
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.541
Ma'am, there's nothing I can do.

644
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:57.000
Look, my son, he is by himself
in that place right now.

645
00:44:00.875 --> 00:44:05.083
He can't say it because...
he can't speak anymore.

646
00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:07.333
But I know for a fact...

647
00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:10.625
he does not like be by himself.

648
00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:15.416
Especially at night. He gets scared.

649
00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:18.583
That boy is honestly...

650
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.625
the first person I ever truly loved.

651
00:44:23.666 --> 00:44:26.666
And soon he is going to go away forever.

652
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.750
And when he does, I have to be there.

653
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:35.625
I will be there
when he leaves this earth. He...

654
00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:39.916
He can't be by himself when that happens.

655
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.958
So, please...

656
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:50.083
Please, let me just go
sleep next to my son.

657
00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:56.625
I-I can't.

658
00:44:57.916 --> 00:44:59.666
I'm sorry, I can't.

659
00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:03.375
Please. I would love it.

660
00:45:03.458 --> 00:45:06.750
- Stop lying!
- I'm not lying!

661
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:09.500
What's...? What's "slam it"?

662
00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:11.583
You gotta take a shot.

663
00:45:13.041 --> 00:45:15.083
Milady. For you.

664
00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:20.500
Oh, my God.

665
00:45:34.041 --> 00:45:35.458
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

666
00:45:35.541 --> 00:45:38.125
You guys, shh... I got a dare, I got a dare.

667
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.208
I dare Nate to kiss Doris.

668
00:45:55.791 --> 00:45:59.208
What the fuck is going on? What is this?

669
00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.291
Put your goddamn clothes on now!

670
00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:06.041
You get the fuck out of my house!

671
00:46:06.125 --> 00:46:07.184
Mom, please calm down.

672
00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:09.041
Oh, no, no, no. You don't talk to
me.

673
00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:11.416
You're having orgies
while I'm sleeping on a cot?

674
00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:15.666
You know what? I'm calling the cops.

675
00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:18.083
What? You're drinking?

676
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.833
You're smoking pot in my house?

677
00:46:19.916 --> 00:46:24.041
No, Mom, be mad at me and ground
me, whatever you want, but let them go.

678
00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:25.541
Please.

679
00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:32.125
You have two minutes.

680
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:35.333
Get out!

681
00:46:36.458 --> 00:46:37.541
Get out.

682
00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.916
- Mom...
- Don't.

683
00:47:01.375 --> 00:47:02.958
I said I don't want to hear it.

684
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.708
I trusted you. And you, well...

685
00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:06.791
It's over.

686
00:47:06.875 --> 00:47:08.833
You're not allowed
to be home alone ever again.

687
00:47:08.916 --> 00:47:10.250
Can I just say sorry?

688
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:13.166
Not one word.

689
00:47:21.083 --> 00:47:22.923
This is our home
until your brother goes.

690
00:47:23.375 --> 00:47:26.125
This noise hasn't stopped,
so get used to it.

691
00:49:19.666 --> 00:49:21.416
Can I please just have a cigarette?

692
00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:43.708
You want to go watch the Super Bowl?

693
00:49:56.458 --> 00:49:59.166
<i>Great drive all the way
down to the five-yard line.</i>

694
00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:00.666
<i>First and goal...</i>

695
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.934
Now I feel like they're
never going to talk to me again.

696
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:04.958
If they're your friends,
they'll talk to you.

697
00:50:05.541 --> 00:50:08.125
- My mom freaked out on them.
- So?

698
00:50:09.125 --> 00:50:11.250
So... I don't know.

699
00:50:12.291 --> 00:50:15.458
I was having fun for the first time
in my life, and she ruined it.

700
00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:18.875
"I was having fun for the first time..."

701
00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:23.875
Listen to yourself?
I mean, come on. I get it, though.

702
00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:27.333
You want to be a normal teenager.

703
00:50:27.416 --> 00:50:30.458
Exactly. But why doesn't she get that?

704
00:50:30.541 --> 00:50:32.666
Well, okay, I got news for you.

705
00:50:34.458 --> 00:50:37.791
You're not normal, Doris.
You're different.

706
00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:41.625
And you are going through
something real here.

707
00:50:42.458 --> 00:50:44.458
This whole thing is a gift.

708
00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.750
It may not seem like it, but it is.

709
00:50:46.833 --> 00:50:48.101
- It's not.
- It is.

710
00:50:48.125 --> 00:50:51.250
- It's definitely not.
- It definitely is, goddamn it.

711
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.291
<i>This defense is not gonna let up.</i>

712
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.958
So how did your wife die?

713
00:51:09.291 --> 00:51:10.833
Oh, my God.

714
00:51:10.916 --> 00:51:14.541
I feel so lucky that I brought
the funnest person in the world

715
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:16.041
to watch this game with.

716
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:22.250
Yeah.

717
00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:24.166
Brain aneurysm.

718
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.416
I remember telling her this stupid joke.

719
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:35.083
You know, when...
You know how birds fly in a V

720
00:51:35.166 --> 00:51:37.166
and sometimes, uh...

721
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.833
you know, one line
is longer than the other?

722
00:51:39.916 --> 00:51:41.833
- Do you know why that is?
- No.

723
00:51:41.916 --> 00:51:44.166
That's because there's more birds
in that in that line.

724
00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:50.791
Silly joke. She started laughing.
And I started laughing.

725
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:53.375
And then I was laughing more
'cause she was laughing more.

726
00:51:53.458 --> 00:51:58.791
And her laugh was just
the greatest thing in the world, and...

727
00:52:00.375 --> 00:52:03.625
And then we went to sleep and...

728
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:10.458
And then, you know, I woke up and...

729
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.166
and she didn't wake up.

730
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:28.583
She was...

731
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:31.500
Didn't wake up.

732
00:52:38.541 --> 00:52:41.333
And that's, that's the love of my life.

733
00:52:41.416 --> 00:52:45.250
And she was gone and then...
there's nothing I could do.

734
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:52.666
Thank you.

735
00:52:54.833 --> 00:52:57.291
<i>If they can get
anything established on this drive</i>

736
00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:59.833
<i>subsequently on offense,
field goal or touchdown...</i>

737
00:52:59.916 --> 00:53:01.500
No, it smells like red tide.

738
00:53:03.541 --> 00:53:06.708
You're going to hurt the chef's feelings.
Now you eat this.

739
00:53:07.541 --> 00:53:09.791
I'll just... I'll stick with these, thanks.

740
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:21.291
Hey, what would you want to do
if you were just a normal teenager?

741
00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.041
I don't know.

742
00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:29.916
I really want to drive.
I'm 17, I only have a learner's permit.

743
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.166
My mom never lets me drive,
but I've always wanted to.

744
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.250
Ever since I was, like,
five years old, I've dreamed about driving

745
00:53:38.333 --> 00:53:39.708
just so I could...

746
00:53:39.791 --> 00:53:43.125
So I could go anywhere,
any time I wanted on my own

747
00:53:43.208 --> 00:53:44.500
and just be like...

748
00:53:44.875 --> 00:53:46.500
Like, completely free.

749
00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.916
Well, amen to that.

750
00:54:03.458 --> 00:54:07.875
Everything reminds me of him!
I swear. I hate him.

751
00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:10.583
- I know you do.
- I know you know I do.

752
00:54:10.666 --> 00:54:13.375
I know you know that I do,
but I just can't get over it.

753
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:14.583
Hey.

754
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.416
So, I'm sorry about my mom.

755
00:54:20.416 --> 00:54:24.541
- Oh, that was so funny.
- Oh, my God, bro.

756
00:54:24.625 --> 00:54:27.458
She was trippin', and I thought
my mom was a maniac.

757
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:30.791
Yeah, that was, like,
some straight up Jerry Springer shit.

758
00:54:30.875 --> 00:54:32.375
- Literally.
- Too funny.

759
00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:36.958
So, we're gonna skip tomorrow
and get fake IDs.

760
00:54:37.041 --> 00:54:39.017
Yeah, we just thought,
since we can't really, like,

761
00:54:39.041 --> 00:54:41.708
hang out at your place anymore,
we can try to go to Ybor City.

762
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:43.791
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

763
00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:46.041
Well, good luck with that.

764
00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:49.000
Good luck? You're coming with us.

765
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:52.458
- I am?
- I mean, are you?

766
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:54.916
Like, what?

767
00:54:55.791 --> 00:54:57.833
Yeah, definitely. I'm coming.

768
00:54:57.916 --> 00:54:58.916

- Nice to meet you.

Bring a goddamn stranger to my house...

792
00:56:07.083 --> 00:56:09.500
Ain't said one word
about that on the phone.

793
00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:10.583
No.

794
00:56:12.583 --> 00:56:14.708
You're 28. You could pass, dog.

795
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.180
- Oh, yeah. That'll work.
- Yeah, that's right.

796
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:19.875
Okay. Laci.

797
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.916
No, no, don't even try
to do me like that Sweet'N Low.

798
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.166
This lady, she's, like, 50 years old.

799
00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:29.625
No. You know what?

800
00:56:29.708 --> 00:56:31.748
I don't need your wack-ass ID.
I'll use my cousin's.

801
00:56:33.875 --> 00:56:35.041
Some bullshit.

802
00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:38.791
What about her? She's 22.

803
00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:42.541
Yeah, she's hot and she has DSL.

804
00:56:42.625 --> 00:56:44.583
- I'll take it.
- D-S-L.

805
00:56:44.666 --> 00:56:46.346
Do you have another one like that?

806
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:47.416
Yes, I do.

807
00:56:49.708 --> 00:56:50.791
Thank you.

808
00:56:52.666 --> 00:56:53.666
Dor?

809
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:56.333
- How much are they?
- A hundred.

810
00:56:57.416 --> 00:56:58.958
I don't have that right now.

811
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:00.666
Thank you, anyway.

812
00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:03.958
Yeah.

813
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.500
I'mma get you.

814
00:57:14.458 --> 00:57:16.291
It's about to expire.
You can just have it.

815
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:17.500
Pro bono.

816
00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:20.708
Oh, Doris, that's perfect.

817
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:24.416
Okay.

818
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.708
Yeah. Thank you, Sweet'N Low.

819
00:57:30.333 --> 00:57:32.125
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

820
00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:35.166
Hey, there.
You mind popping the trunk for me?

821
00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.958
They were just dropping me off.
They're leaving now.

822
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.517
- See you tomorrow.
- Peace.

823
00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.021
Can't believe she lives here.

824
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.041
Get in. You're driving me to the store.

825
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:48.333
Seriously? You're letting me drive?

826
00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:51.333
Yeah. This isn't for you.
I'm sick of driving.

827
00:57:52.916 --> 00:57:55.333
What are you waiting for? Come on.

828
00:58:03.583 --> 00:58:07.500
Okay, normal girl. Show me what you got.

829
00:58:10.166 --> 00:58:15.250
Um. Don't freak out,
'cause I, like, know the answer, but...

830
00:58:16.416 --> 00:58:18.541
which pedal's go and which is stop?

831
00:58:19.916 --> 00:58:21.166
Are you serious?

832
00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:24.208
Get the hell out of my car.

833
00:58:33.625 --> 00:58:36.625
Okay, first things first.
What's first?

834
00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:40.500
Seatbelt?

835
00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:42.375
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you right now.

836
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:47.041
I think I'm going to cry. Yes. Seatbelt.
Put the seatbelt on.

837
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.750
Good. Now, second thing.

838
00:58:52.708 --> 00:58:56.125
You want to make sure
that your mirrors are in the right place.

839
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:59.375
So can you see out the back? This one?

840
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.375
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

841
00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:05.298
Now, what about the side mirrors?
Can you see everything to either side?

842
00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:07.083
Yeah.

843
00:59:07.166 --> 00:59:11.583
Now you take your foot off the
brake and hit the gas on the right.

844
00:59:11.666 --> 00:59:13.500
Right there. Yeah. Hit it.

845
00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:16.416
Good. Go. Good. Okay. You gotta steer.

846
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:18.250
You gotta steer. Are you steering?

847
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:20.726
Good, good. You're doing good.

848
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.416
La, la, la... Over, over, over.

849
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.500
Okay, Just stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

850
00:59:26.083 --> 00:59:27.333
Stop.

851
00:59:27.416 --> 00:59:30.083
Okay, good.
You've got the brakes worked out.

852
00:59:31.708 --> 00:59:33.791
Now go easy. Just take it easy.

853
00:59:33.875 --> 00:59:37.041
You don't have to press down
so hard on the gas, but...

854
00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:39.333
Okay, watch out for that shed.

855
00:59:39.416 --> 00:59:40.875
Oh, whoa, whoa. Okay.

856
00:59:40.958 --> 00:59:43.208
Try to avoid... To the left.

857
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.041
Just steer to the right.
To the right.

858
00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:51.166
Okay, now turn... Left, left. Get around.

859
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.875
Okay, no, but you don't have to go.
Watch out for the barrel!

860
00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:55.250
Watch out for the barrel!

861
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:02.750
Look, it's not even an expensive car, but...

862
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.333
- I'm sorry.
- You know, it runs.

863
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:08.333
Just try to go straight. You don't
have to go to the right or to the left.

864
01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:11.416
Good. Good. Nice and slow. Straight.

865
01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.833
Bravo.

866
01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.958
This is good driving.

867
01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.851
- Good. Okay, stop, stop.
- Which way?

868
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.333
Yeah. Toward us.

869
01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:29.500
Oh, thank you, God. Thank you for letting
me live through this.

870
01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:24.583
Oh, good morning.

871
01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.541
How are you doing?

872
01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.333
I'm okay.

873
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.416
I just...

874
01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:52.583
I keep thinking about
when I was pregnant with my son.

875
01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:56.041
There was this anticipation.

876
01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:58.125
I was waiting because he was...

877
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.666
arriving at any moment, and I wondered...

878
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.250
what would he be like?

879
01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:07.541
What would he bring into my life?

880
01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.458
But now I'm waiting for him to leave.

881
01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:17.625
And I wonder,
what is he going to take from my life?

882
01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.625
It's kind of funny.

883
01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:26.375
It must be very hard.

884
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.250
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

885
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.958
Since we're the only people out
here...

886
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:42.250
Makes sense.

887
01:02:48.666 --> 01:02:51.333
I've been the mom
of a sick kid for so many years,

888
01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:53.875
I don't know
who I'm gonna be when he's gone.

889
01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:57.833
Do you have any other children?

890
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.416
No.

891
01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:07.333
Oh, my God. Yes. Yes. Christ. Yes.

892
01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:11.375
Of course. Of course,
I have another child.

893
01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.750
I don't know,
I don't know why I just said that.

894
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.875
No, I have a daughter.

895
01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:22.333
Well, she'll still be here
after he's gone.

896
01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:29.125
Life will still be here after he's gone.
It's just going to look different.

897
01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.750
Then in 2003,
they were removed again.

898
01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:37.101
We're going out tonight, yes?

899
01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.958
One billion percent.

900
01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:41.583
I just pray my mom goes to sleep
so I can sneak out.

901
01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:44.000
She will.
You gotta think positive.

902
01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:46.291
Brittany. What's your opinion?

903
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.250
A... bout what?

904
01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:52.458
Terri Schiavo, the person
we've been discussing all morning?

905
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.541
Right. Yeah.
Full disclosure, I haven't been listening.

906
01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:04.750
But I will say I just think
the whole Schiavo thing is just gross.

907
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.290
And why is that?

908
01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.458
Because people should be allowed to die.

909
01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:11.381
Like she told her husband to let her die
if she ever ended up like that.

910
01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:14.416
And all these nosy-ass people
just need to respect her wishes.

911
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.833
I didn't ask you,
but thank you, Laci.

912
01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:21.458
I mean, you really should be asking Doris.

913
01:04:21.541 --> 01:04:24.041
She, like, basically knows Terri Schiavo.

914
01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.875
Yeah, her brother's in hospice
with Schiavo right now.

915
01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.166
Who's Doris?

916
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.291
I am.

917
01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.958
You don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to, Doris.

918
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.208
No, it's okay.

919
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:40.583
It's just, it's sort of hard
to talk about it like this.

920
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.250
Like, the way we talk
about stuff in this class.

921
01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.291
What do you mean?

922
01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.666
Just, like, I don't know...

923
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.500
We sit here and we talk
about hypothetical situations

924
01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:52.375
and what the right or wrong action is,

925
01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.583
but you can't really answer
those questions 'cause you don't know.

926
01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.810
You don't know what's right or wrong
until it's happening to you.

927
01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:02.291
Like, we can say Terri's husband is
a monster for wanting to let her die,

928
01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:04.583
or her parents are monsters
for wanting her to live.

929
01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:06.875
But we don't know, do we?

930
01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.625
Because we're not them.

931
01:05:09.791 --> 01:05:14.500
I guess you don't know
what's ethical... until you know.

932
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.166
That was so dope.

933
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.583
So smart, Doris.

934
01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.833
See you, tonight, baby.

935
01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:41.208
- Doris.
- Hmm?

936
01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.500
I just want to say I...

937
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I know it's hard
sleeping here every night.

938
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:52.541
And I know you're a good kid.

939
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.458
I mean, the whole
party thing was partly my fault,

940
01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:59.083
I shouldn't have left you home alone.

941
01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.916
Okay.

942
01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:06.958
Thank you.

943
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.500
Man, I'm so tired.

944
01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:23.583
Night, Mom.

945
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.208
You know...

946
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.416
if you forget how tragic this place is,

947
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.791
it's... almost like
we're having a slumber party.

948
01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:37.583
Yep.

949
01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:41.750
Remember when you were little?

950
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:49.000
We'd build forts in the living room,
and you'd always yell, "Slumber party!"

951
01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.416
We're going to have fun again, you and me,

952
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:07.166
when this is over, I'll...

953
01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.750
I'll learn how to be fun again.

954
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.583
Mom, you should really get some sleep.
You've been working so hard.

955
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.708
Okay. Okay.

956
01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:29.375
Jeez. Goodnight.

957
01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.291
I believe in psychics.

958
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.875
- What?
- I do.

959
01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:08.208
- Oh, my God, she made it out.
- Holy crap.

960
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:10.500
I am legit scared of your mom.

961
01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:13.708
I was like, "That bitch is gonna
run out here and stab us."

962
01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:17.041
Here, I brought you an outfit,
but one of the boot heels is broken,

963
01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:20.250
so just, like, don't dance too hard
or you'll fully face plant.

964
01:08:20.333 --> 01:08:22.416
Got it. Thank you.

965
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.000
Okay, so Nate and Megan
are meeting us there.

966
01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.916
- Oh, and Cody.
- Oh, have you met him yet?

967
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.726
- No.
- You're going to hate him.

968
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:30.833
Well, look, he got me this.

969
01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:33.500
You know, it's like,
a promise to stop being like,

970
01:08:33.583 --> 01:08:35.500
a liar and an asshole and stuff.

971
01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:37.791
Well, whatever you want to do,
I support you.

972
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:39.791
I just want you to be happy.

973
01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:42.708
You see, Brit?
That is what a real friend looks like.

974
01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:44.833
Whatever. Easy for you to say, Doris.

975
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:48.166
You haven't been dealing
with this shit for four years.

976
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.250
Four years?

977
01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:51.541
No, it's not four years,
it's actually three.

978
01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:52.791
'Cause the first year,

979
01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:54.601
- he was not an asshole.
- What are you talking about?

980
01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:57.750
When I first started dating Cody,
he was such a sweetheart.

981
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.416
I would do anything to go back.

982
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.291
You were just brainwashed.

983
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:07.125
- I'm so nervous.
- No, girl, we're fine.

984
01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:09.000
But definitely stop whispering.

985
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:10.708
Hi.

986
01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:15.375
Thank you.

987
01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.291
Hold.

988
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.416
Your ID is gonna expire soon.

989
01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.666
Oh, yeah.

990
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.750
Duh.

991
01:09:32.833 --> 01:09:36.708
I gotta go to the DMV
and get a new one 'cause...

992
01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:38.416
'cause that's where I got that one.

993
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.333
But I mean, you knew that obviously,
'cause you work here, so...

994
01:09:49.083 --> 01:09:51.458
I thought we were gonna
have to bail you out of jail.

995
01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:53.581
He definitely knew I was lying.
I almost passed out.

996
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.041
Yeah.

997
01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:58.708
Oh. Hi!

998
01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.208
Guys, I have mommy's credit card.
So drinks on me.

999
01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:06.041
No, no, no, I got Doris.

1000
01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:07.726
What can I get you to drink?

1001
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.291
What are you having?

1002
01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.875
Vodka-cranberry, bitch.

1003
01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:12.625
Vodka-cranberry, please.

1004
01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.041
Well, look who it is.

1005
01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:21.166
Dirty Cody
grinding on his next victim.

1006
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.833
Oh, my God. That's him?
Well, at least they're just dancing.

1007
01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.041
Are you kidding me?

1008
01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:32.541
Excuse me, ladies.

1009
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:39.208
Really? Hi, sorry.
Are you freakin' serious?

1010
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.458
There's so many
gross guys here.

1011
01:10:42.541 --> 01:10:44.708
I know, right? They're so creepy.

1012
01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.083
- Yeah.
- I'm like, ew. Like, stop staring at me.

1013
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.184
- All right, vodka-cranberry.
- Thank you.

1014
01:10:52.208 --> 01:10:54.208
Fought like hell for this.
Almost killed a guy.

1015
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.541
- Worth it, though?
- Definitely.

1016
01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:04.041
Oh, my God.

1017
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:07.791
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

1018
01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:13.666
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

1019
01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:16.578
<i>I can't believe
you're not answering your phone.</i>

1020
01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:20.000
<i>I don't know where you are,
but you need to get back here right now.</i>

1021
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
<i>The nurses are all here and...</i>

1022
01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:25.375
<i>it's time.</i>

1023
01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:29.541
<i>Your brother's... he's gonna go tonight.</i>

1024
01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:30.916
<i>End of message.</i>

1025
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:51.458
Brittany?

1026
01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:56.000
I'm so sorry.
Can you take me back to Suncoast?

1027
01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:57.333
What?

1028
01:11:57.416 --> 01:12:00.416
I need to go back to Suncoast.
My brother's dying.

1029
01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:02.541
Dude, I can't hear you.

1030
01:12:03.291 --> 01:12:04.833
My brother's about to die.

1031
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.041
Oh, my God. Yeah. Yes.

1032
01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.208
Of course. Let's go.

1033
01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:14.125
- Go.
- Okay. Yeah.

1034
01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:27.916
Are you kidding me?

1035
01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:30.375
This is how you're dressed?

1036
01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.708
Is he okay?

1037
01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:43.833
- What's going on?
- Okay, relax.

1038
01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.885
He's probably not
going to pass away tonight,

1039
01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:48.208
but you never know.

1040
01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:50.458
He is in hospice.

1041
01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:54.166
What?

1042
01:12:55.875 --> 01:13:00.500
- You lied?
- No, I did not lie. I did not lie.

1043
01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:03.291
He could have died and you weren't here.

1044
01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:05.708
And after I tell you
what good kid you are,

1045
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:08.083
you sneak out, you dress like a hooker?

1046
01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:10.291
But you said...

1047
01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.458
What is wrong with you?

1048
01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:19.291
What is wrong with me?
Oh, that-that is great, Doris.

1049
01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:21.416
You break all the rules,
and I'm the bad guy.

1050
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.583
You're worse than the bad guy.
You're a fucking monster.

1051
01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.750
You don't tell someone that.
You don't lie about that.

1052
01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:30.142
Oh, good. Here come the waterworks.

1053
01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:33.250
Yes. Okay, I snuck out,
but that doesn't mean you can...

1054
01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:37.125
I've always done
everything you asked me to.

1055
01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.791
My entire childhood was wasted
taking care of him

1056
01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.541
so that you didn't have to have to.

1057
01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:42.916
Didn't have to?

1058
01:13:44.916 --> 01:13:50.750
Do you think I liked leaving my sick child
so I could go serve food to tourists?

1059
01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:52.125
Huh?

1060
01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:56.583
You think I wanted to work
instead of be with my boy?

1061
01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.375
I had to work so we could eat,
so we could pay rent.

1062
01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:04.250
So you, you can go to your private school
with your perverted friends.

1063
01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:07.291
And go to the slut store!

1064
01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:13.416
I'm done.

1065
01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.250
I'm done with this.

1066
01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:27.375
You can live here with your precious son.

1067
01:14:28.916 --> 01:14:31.041
He's basically dead anyway.

1068
01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:41.666
I don't want to talk right now.

1069
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.166
We don't have to talk.

1070
01:14:43.916 --> 01:14:45.333
I just want to be alone.

1071
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:48.166
Doris, I am so sorry.

1072
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.333
- Did your brother pass away?
- No.

1073
01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:52.923
She told me he was about to
and she lied to me.

1074
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.458
She's fucking psycho.

1075
01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:56.875
You all right?

1076
01:14:56.958 --> 01:15:00.083
I'm fine. These stupid boots.

1077
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.791
Listen, I know you're not going to
want to hear this right now,

1078
01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.708
but your mom just did you a huge favor.

1079
01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:10.375
I saw you run in the building.
You're not ready for him to go.

1080
01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.892
You need to make your peace with him
while you still have the chance.

1081
01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:13.916
Shut up!

1082
01:15:14.666 --> 01:15:17.250
Please, just shut the fuck up.

1083
01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:19.500
Who even are you?

1084
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:23.208
You're, like, some old guy
who's obsessed with Terri Schiavo

1085
01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:24.958
'cause you can't get over your dead wife?

1086
01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:28.750
Do I look like your wife or something?
Is that why you're always bothering me?

1087
01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:34.125
Well, I'm not her,
so just leave me the fuck alone.

1088
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
No, that ain't it at all.

1089
01:15:38.541 --> 01:15:41.458
You're, you're a young kid.
It just seemed like you needed...

1090
01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:43.125
I don't need anything from you.

Oh, my God. Back up.
Give her some space.

1104
01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:50.805
It's okay, girl.
We're here for you.

1105
01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.625
Forever. We'll always be here.

1106
01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:56.500
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1107
01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:57.916
He didn't die.

1108
01:16:58.791 --> 01:17:00.291
Wait. What?

1109
01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:01.958
He didn't die.

1110
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.291
It was a false alarm.

1111
01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:08.000
Oh, thank God. 'Cause I had zero idea
what to say to you just now.

1112
01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.625
Do people, like, actually like to hear
"I'm sorry for your loss?"

1113
01:17:11.708 --> 01:17:14.333
Because I always just feel
so generic when I say it.

1114
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.416
Yeah, that's fine.

1115
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.708
Well, then I guess Nate has something
he wants to ask you.

1116
01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:22.791
Stop!

1117
01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:24.392
He wasn't going to do it today.

1118
01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:26.309
'Cause if your brother had died,
he felt weird asking...

1119
01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:28.375
Oh, no, no, Shut up.
Okay, both of you.

1120
01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:30.000
I don't need you to speak for me.

1121
01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.375
He so does.

1122
01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:33.916
Oh, my God.

1123
01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:40.583
Nah, you know, I was just wondering if,
you know, you wanted to go to prom?

1124
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:42.750
With me.

1125
01:17:43.916 --> 01:17:44.916
Oh.

1126
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.166
Yeah, of course. I'd love to.

1127
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.791
Good. All right.

1128
01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:53.750
Okay, kiss her!

1129
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:59.916
Okay, now finger her.

1130
01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.375
Come on.

1131
01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:03.750
- Wow.
- Oh, God.

1132
01:18:03.833 --> 01:18:05.333
Sorry about her.

1133
01:18:56.416 --> 01:18:57.916
<i>And we have confirmation</i>

1134
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.875
<i>that her feeding tube
was removed this afternoon.</i>

1135
01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:05.208
<i>Her parents are running out of time
and running out of courts.</i>

1136
01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:05.625
<i>Okay, now do Muscle Beach!</i>

1137
01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:10.250
<i>Now do silly dance!</i>

1138
01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:13.375
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

1139
01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:15.708
<i>Now do moonwalk.</i>

1140
01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:18.250
<i>How do you do it?</i>

1141
01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.625
<i>No, Doris. Slide your foot.</i>

1142
01:20:20.708 --> 01:20:21.875
<i>Slide.</i>

1143
01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:29.333
Whoa, Mom, you're actually good
at it.

1144
01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:33.083
<i>Slide.</i>

1145
01:20:35.041 --> 01:20:38.291
<i>Slide, slide, slide...</i>

1146
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.333
<i>And slide, and slide...</i>

1147
01:20:44.208 --> 01:20:45.333
<i>Nice.</i>

1148
01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:47.416
<i>Good.</i>

1149
01:20:49.625 --> 01:20:50.791
<i>That's good.</i>

1150
01:22:31.833 --> 01:22:33.958
Your hair looks so good.

1151
01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.309
No, I'm like, obsessed with yours.

1152
01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:36.642
- Thank you.
- I love it.

1153
01:22:36.666 --> 01:22:38.666
She was super slow,
but it's fine.

1154
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.291
Oh, my God.
She did mine in, like, an hour.

1155
01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:45.208
Okay. She is way too cute.
Y'all are going to die.

1156
01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:49.291
Yes.

1157
01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:51.208
That's so hot.

1158
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:54.291
Are you sure I can wear this?
It's so nice.

1159
01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:55.625
No, you look so good in it.

1160
01:22:55.708 --> 01:22:57.833
I don't know.
I think the straps are a little long.

1161
01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.958
Oh, my mom can fix that.

1162
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.500
Mom, can you bring your sewing kit?

1163
01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:04.750
Doris, I think it is so cool

1164
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:07.041
that you're comfortable
wearing Laci's old dress.

1165
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.950
What are you doing?

1166
01:23:10.583 --> 01:23:13.458
Like, what are you
actually doing right now?

1167
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:15.375
Sorry. I, like, meant as a good thing.

1168
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:19.083
Guys, Cody's not taking me to prom.

1169
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:21.625
- Sorry. What?
- Yeah, no.

1170
01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:23.666
He said he'll
meet me at Kyle's before.

1171
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:30.041
"But I've already been to prom. It sucked,
and I don't feel like going again."

1172
01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:33.500
- What?
- Oh, my God. I hate him.

1173
01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:36.666
I mean, for him to do this to you
on the holiest of nights.

1174
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:40.000
- No, I can't even.
- It just, it's all my fault.

1175
01:23:40.083 --> 01:23:42.916
I need to walk away, but I just... I can't.

1176
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.916
Yes, you can. You can do it.

1177
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.041
You're strong enough to walk away.

1178
01:23:47.125 --> 01:23:51.291
- I mean, obviously I'm not.
- No, listen to me.

1179
01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:54.708
You deserve so much better.

1180
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:59.250
You're such good person
and you're such an amazing friend.

1181
01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:00.958
You're like an angel.

1182
01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:05.916
I mean, you all have, like, saved my life.

1183
01:24:07.583 --> 01:24:10.750
- You're so...
- Oh, my God.

1184
01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.916
Okay, fine. I'm breaking up with him.

1185
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.250
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1186
01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:28.875
- It's done.
- You did it?

1187
01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:30.875
- Actually?
- Yes.

1188
01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:35.833
Oh. My. Goodness.

1189
01:24:36.666 --> 01:24:39.000
Did I just step onto a fashion runway?

1190
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.416
Can you fix her straps?

1191
01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.541
Is this from your junior prom?

1192
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.583
Oh, it looks so beautiful on you, Doris.

1193
01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:49.166
Thank you. You're so nice.

1194
01:24:49.916 --> 01:24:51.583
Your mom is so nice.

1195
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
- Come on.
- Okay.

1196
01:24:53.083 --> 01:24:54.726
Let me just get you measured.

1197
01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:58.583
These straps are gonna, like,
dig into my feet.

1198
01:24:58.666 --> 01:25:01.041
Dude, it's worth it.
They're so cute.

1199
01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:05.000
- Hello?
- Hi...

1200
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.750
I just wanted to let you know

1201
01:25:09.666 --> 01:25:12.958
it looks like he might go tonight
or tomorrow morning...

1202
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.666
They say 'cause
his fingers are really yellow

1203
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:20.791
and his breath is pretty labored. So...

1204
01:25:25.291 --> 01:25:27.708
<i>Look, I'm really sorry, okay?</i>

1205
01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:30.166
<i>I should've never done that.</i>

1206
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.750
<i>I should never have lied to you.
It's just...</i>

1207
01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:38.583
There's no excuse. I... It was cruel...

1208
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:42.375
and I understand
if you can't forgive me, but...

1209
01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:45.208
But don't punish him. Okay?

1210
01:25:50.250 --> 01:25:54.416
You do what you want.
I just wanted to let you know.

1211
01:25:57.958 --> 01:25:59.458
Thanks for letting me know.

1212
01:26:00.833 --> 01:26:01.958
Everything cool?

1213
01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:08.750
Whatever.

1214
01:26:08.833 --> 01:26:11.083
What about when you
head-butted Michael Rieger?

1215
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.500
Oh, my God.
Who even talks about it anymore?

1216
01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:16.500
You can't lie, Nate.
That was some psycho shit.

1217
01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.875
He was trying to fight me, bro.
What was I supposed to do?

1218
01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:21.041
Anything.

1219
01:26:21.125 --> 01:26:22.583
Do you know Mike Rieger?

1220
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:25.291
Hello?

1221
01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:28.083
Oh, uh...

1222
01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:31.125
No, I don't think so.

1223
01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.375
Are you okay?

1224
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

1225
01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:42.708
You're not, like,
upset about something I said, are you?

1226
01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.583
What? No.

1227
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.083
Okay. Okay, good.

1228
01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:50.916
This is my song. Turn it up!

1229
01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:54.875
<i>♪ Don't you wish your girlfriend was a

1235
01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:27.416
I'm really stoked
you came with me tonight, by the way.

1236
01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:30.291
Oh, yeah, me too.

1237
01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:36.791
How's your mom's parrot?

1238
01:27:37.291 --> 01:27:38.916
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's good.

1239
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.333
You know, I actually taught him
to say, "Suck my dick!"

1240
01:27:42.083 --> 01:27:45.041
It was super funny,
but now he won't stop saying it.

1241
01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:47.625
So now my mom's pretty pissed.

1242
01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:52.500
Oh, my God.

1243
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.833
- Shit, he looks so hot.
- Here we go.

1244
01:27:59.333 --> 01:28:01.375
Laci, can we talk for a second?

1245
01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:04.875
No, Cody.

1246
01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:08.375
Okay, we're done.
I meant what I said, okay? This is over.

1247
01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:10.559
Please baby, you don't have to do
this. I'm gonna come with you.

1248
01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:12.458
No, it's too late, okay? I just...

1249
01:28:12.541 --> 01:28:14.666
I... need to stay away from you.

1250
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:17.875
We have to be done. Forever.

1251
01:28:18.208 --> 01:28:19.333
I'm serious.

1252
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.541
Oh, my God.

1253
01:28:27.041 --> 01:28:30.666
Yes! Fuck you, Cody!

1254
01:28:31.125 --> 01:28:38.000
You finally did it.
You... actually did it. You're free.

1255
01:28:39.416 --> 01:28:43.958
This is the best night of my life.

1256
01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:47.875
Guys... Y'all...

1257
01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:50.500
Oh, my God, I just realized something.

1258
01:28:51.708 --> 01:28:53.541
This is it.

1259
01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:56.750
No, no, no, I'm serious.

1260
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:03.333
This is the most important
night of our lives.

1261
01:29:03.416 --> 01:29:05.083
This is everything.

1262
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:09.333
We're all together,
and that's all that matters.

1263
01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:15.916
Like, this really is the
biggest fucking night of our lives.

1264
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.291
Seriously.

1265
01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:21.791
Like, you guys are my...

1266
01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:24.416
my everything.

1267
01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:28.375
We're always gonna
be here for each other.

1268
01:29:28.458 --> 01:29:30.750
And I'm never going to forget you guys.

1269
01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:34.041
Never. Ever.

1270
01:29:34.125 --> 01:29:36.416
- I have to go.
- What?

1271
01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:38.500
Oh, my God. I have to go right now.

1272
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.791
- What the fuck, Doris?
- No, I just need to talk to my brother.

1273
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:42.875

Max?

1303
01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:19.708
- I need to talk to you.
- He can still hear you.

1304
01:32:20.125 --> 01:32:22.833
- You can still talk to him.
- No!

1305
01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:28.875
Don't go.
I don't know why I wasn't here. I'm sorry.

1306
01:32:31.125 --> 01:32:35.875
You can't leave me here by myself.
Don't leave me, please!

1307
01:32:44.333 --> 01:32:47.125
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1308
01:32:47.916 --> 01:32:52.416
I was so selfish. I was so awful to you.

1309
01:32:52.875 --> 01:32:56.000
I should have made you brownies.
And I know you love them.

1310
01:32:56.083 --> 01:32:57.958
And I never made them for you.

1311
01:32:58.041 --> 01:33:01.541
And I should have let you watch
skateboarding videos all day.

1312
01:33:01.625 --> 01:33:03.665
I should have given you the remote.
I should have...

1313
01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:07.625
Oh, Dorie, you were so good to him.

1314
01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:11.375
No. He knows.

1315
01:33:11.916 --> 01:33:14.666
He knows you love him. He knows.

1316
01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:17.416
I promise you.

1317
01:33:22.666 --> 01:33:24.208
I promise.

1318
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.875
He knows.

1319
01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:49.958
I'm sorry. He was just really young,

1320
01:34:50.041 --> 01:34:53.000
and we don't get
a lot of young people here. So...

1321
01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:57.291
Thank you...

1322
01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:01.000
for taking care of him.

1323
01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.666
Of course.

1324
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:55.708
I'll be outside, Mom.

1325
01:35:57.125 --> 01:35:58.333
Okay, sweetheart.

1326
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.458
Where was everyone going?

1327
01:36:29.333 --> 01:36:30.541
City Hall.

1328
01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:33.750
They're just going to
wait outside until the...

1329
01:36:34.958 --> 01:36:37.833
judge agrees to start feeding her again.

1330
01:36:43.916 --> 01:36:45.375
Why aren't you with them?

1331
01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:52.875
I just wanted to make sure
that you're all right.

1332
01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.875
He died.

1333
01:37:06.916 --> 01:37:08.833
And it feels just like you said.

1334
01:37:13.625 --> 01:37:14.958
But I think...

1335
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.541
No...

1336
01:37:18.166 --> 01:37:19.541
I know...

1337
01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.166
he's in a better place now,

1338
01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:25.791
and I know he's happier.

1339
01:37:27.083 --> 01:37:28.375
He's free.

1340
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:31.125
I can feel it.

1341
01:37:32.708 --> 01:37:36.125
And isn't heaven, like,
what you guys believe in?

1342
01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:40.125
Isn't it supposed to be
a lot better than this place?

1343
01:37:42.375 --> 01:37:43.750
It's just...

1344
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:47.708
I don't know, I can just feel it.

1345
01:37:50.125 --> 01:37:51.416
I know it.

1346
01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.958
And...

1347
01:37:58.708 --> 01:38:00.000
And I miss him...

1348
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:06.125
and I hate this...

1349
01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:13.000
but he's free.

1350
01:38:21.416 --> 01:38:23.416
So glad I met you, Doris.

1351
01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:26.875
Thank God you're not normal.

1352
01:38:38.333 --> 01:38:39.791
Mom, this is Paul.

1353
01:38:41.708 --> 01:38:43.250
I remember.

1354
01:38:45.125 --> 01:38:48.583
Well, it's nice to see you again.

1355
01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:51.583
I never got your name.

1357
01:38:56.625 --> 01:38:58.666
Nice to see you again, Kristine.

1358
01:39:02.291 --> 01:39:03.666

Yeah.
