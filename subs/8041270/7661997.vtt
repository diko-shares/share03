00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.645
Hey! Swing it in! Get it on the deck!

2
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.153
Let it go!

3
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.364
Hold on! Hold on!

4
00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.459
<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

5
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:28.797
<i>And with every confrontation, we learn
more about this frightening new reality.</i>

6
00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.302
<i>How did we get here?</i>

7
00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.886
Oh, my god.

8
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.473
<i>It's been three decades
since the deadly events at Jurassic park,</i>

9
00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:41.727
<i>and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.</i>

10
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:46.273
<i>After the devastating eruption
of Isla Mublar's long-dormant volcano,</i>

11
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.568
<i>those who survived were transported
to the mainland</i>

12
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.529
many of the larger predators
were captured,

13
00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.698
but the remaining creatures
scattered here,

14
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.367
in Big Rock National Park.

15
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.996
<i>While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civilization</i>

16
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.624
<i>struggled to adapt
to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

17
00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.628
<i>Local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable,</i>

18
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.547
<i>and when hungry, extremely violent.</i>

19
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:14.551
<u>As the dinosaurs spread across borders,
a global black market has risen.</u>

20
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:18.680
- They're not ours.
- Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

21
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:21.808
<i>To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers,</i>

22
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.852
<i>the us congress awarded
sole collection rights</i>

23
00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.105
<i>to the global giant Biosyn Genetics.</i>

24
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.816
At biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea

25
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.945
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

26
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:39.618
<i>CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a
sanctuary in Italy's dolomite Mountains,</i>

27
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.537
<i>where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs ' ancient immune systems</i>

28
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.748
<i>for unique pharmaceutical properties.</i>

29
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.377
<i>While Biosyn believes
we can handle genetic power responsibly,</i>

30
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.170
<i>the public remains skeptical</i>

31
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:56.343
<i>some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in Biosyn's profits.</i>

32
00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:01.056
And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared,

33
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.641
leading to a worldwide search.

34
00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:06.228
<i>Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte lock wood</i>

35
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.981
<i>deceased daughter of Jurassic park
co-founder, Benjamin lock wood.</i>

36
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.360
<i>Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,</i>

37
00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.237
<i>can we face the consequences?</i>

38
00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:17.406
<i>Are we responsible for them,</i>

39
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.991
<i>or should they be left
to fend for themselves?</i>

40
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.370
<i>As we adapt to an ever-changing world,</i>

41
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.831
<i>we must find answers to these questions,</i>

42
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.625
<i>for their safety as well as for our own.</i>

43
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.879
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

44
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.966
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

45
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.302
It's medieval.

46
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:25.473
Claire.

47
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.063
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

48
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.234
I don't think he's gonna make it.

49
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.451
No. What are you doing?
We could report this.

50
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.037
The DFW takes days to investigate.

51
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.539
We can save this one now.

52
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.083
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

53
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:56.713
Okay. Here we go.

54
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.595
Nope. No!

55
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.764
- Lift.
- Okay.

56
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.766
- Support the head.
- Yeah.

57
00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.518
Okay. Yeah.

58
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.496
- Hurry up!
- Check the right side.

59
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.355
- With me.
- Go, go, go.

60
00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:14.940
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

61
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.988
- Hold on!
- To what?

62
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.507
Shit.

63
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.973
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

64
00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.398
- No! Claire! No, no, Claire!
- Oh, god.

65
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.782
Oh, shit.

66
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.788
Everybody good?

67
00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:27.512
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

68
00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.347
and then we hit them again.

69
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.933
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

70
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:33.602
We're done.

71
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.105
I got a call last week.

72
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.817
It's a real job, something I can do
to effectively change things.

73
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.028
- I gotta take it.
- They need us.

74
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.072
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

75
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.408
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

76
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.493
- Claire.
- I mean, this is crazy.

77
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.329
Claire,

78
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:54.414
you're doing the right thing.

79
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.918
But this... this isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

80
00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:01.939
Honestly, you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

81
00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.800
Aren't you and Owen still,
like, a weird thing?

82
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.844
- It's not that weird.
- He didn't mean "weird."

83
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.471
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

84
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.848
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

85
00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:33.745
Hyah!

86
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:51.805
Let's bring 'em home!

87
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.014
Hyah!

88
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.745
Hyah!

89
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.288
Okay, come here.

90
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.877
Okay.

91
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.755
Hey, hey.

92
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.641
We're gonna get you
some place safe.

93
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.023
Hey.

94
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.110
There you go.

95
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.987
There you go.

96
00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.073
Yeah.

97
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.152
[Gasps}

98
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.198
Holy crap.

99
00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.035
Wow. Look at this.

100
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.705
What in the world, man?

101
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.605
So, the dinosaurs...

102
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.377
Hey.

103
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:35.546
Where you been?

104
00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.383
Nowhere. What are you burning?

105
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:42.303
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.

106
00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.224
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

107
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.036
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

108
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.228
- Well, are you?
- No.

109
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.563
Maisie, you're literally looking
everywhere but here.

110
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.774
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

111
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.113
Maisie,

112
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:01.781
can we start over?

113
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.718
I know, Claire. There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

114
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.619
I'm not angry.

115
00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:09.706
- That means you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

116
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.001
- I can take care of myself.
- Hey.

117
00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:17.088
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

118
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.132
How would I know what people do?

119
00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.303
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

120
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:27.390
Besides,
I'm not even a real person anyway.

121
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.476
- What?
- I was made from someone else.

122
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.395
I'm not me.

123
00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.031
You are the only you who ever was.

124
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:46.409
What?

125
00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.953
- N-No.
- Was that, like, really corny?

126
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.204
It was so corny.

127
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.999
- Can we keep that between us?
- Can't promise that.

128
00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.965
- Hey, kid.
- Hello.

129
00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.133
Sorry I'm late.

130
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.387
Aw.

131
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.097
You smell like horses.

132
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.391
- Mmm.
- Oh, you like that, do ya?

133
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.642
- I do. Yeah.
- Oh.

134
00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.395
Okay. Um...

135
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.065
I'm gonna make dinner.

136
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.067
Everything okay?

137
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.444
She went into town again.

138
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.616
Ah, this kid.
Did you talk to her?

139
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.368
I tried.

140
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.330
I'll talk to her.

141
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.516
Hey. Cut away from yourself.

142
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.148
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

143
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.233
- Stone-cold.
- Right?

144
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.069
- I would not mess with her.
- No way.

145
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.912
Listen. We should probably
talk about you going into town.

146
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.163
I don't...

147
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.686
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

148
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.877
You're not trapped here.
We just don't trust people.

149
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.378
No, you just don't trust me.

150
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.923
And then you expect me to trust you.

151
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.342
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

152
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.265
That went great.

153
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.184
What is happening?

154
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.229
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

155
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.730
You remember what that was like.

156
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.982
I do.

157
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.861
We can't keep her here forever.

158
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.448
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge.

159
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.492
If they find her,
we're never gonna see her again.

160
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:17.161
We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we're gonna do.

161
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.371
Protect her how?

162
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.289
By locking her inside?

163
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.709
<i>She's got questions.</i>

164
00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:27.213
<i>You know?
Questions we can't answer.</i>

165
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.925
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

166
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:36.639
<i>Who Charlotte lock wood was.</i>

167
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.272
Tracked Grady to his house.

168
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:47.233
You were right. Raptor's got a juvenile.

169
00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.903
But listen, there's something else.

170
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.073
I found that girl you've been after.

171
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.172
Here you go.

172
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.538
Thanks for coming.

173
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.540
Wasn't sure who to call.

174
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.544
Fish and wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

175
00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.922
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

176
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.757
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

177
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.841
a hundred yards each?

178
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.718
These your students?

179
00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:42.014
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

180
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.558
So, this is right up our alley.

181
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.602
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

182
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.313
You seen anything like
this before?

183
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.565
No. Not like this.

184
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.652
They've been leaving degraded fields
all across the mid west.

185
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:59.407
First these big companies try to kill off
all the insects, now this.

186
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.377
Is that your land?

187
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.296
That's the bennetts' corn.
The locusts didn't eat that.

188
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.716
You plant the same seed
as the bennetts?

189
00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:19.927
We're independent.

190
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.472
They use biosyn seed.

191
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.476
Yeah, I bet they do.

192
00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.646
You say you caught a live one?

193
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.486
- Hey, Madeline?
- Yeah?

194
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.114
We just gotta clean out
this little cylinder.

195
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.032
Okay. Let her down slow.

196
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.661
- Got it?
- Yeah.

197
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.121
Easy.

198
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.832
Let's start padding that other side.

199
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.251
Just about there. I'm on it.

200
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.087
Why do we dig?

201
00:20:55.171 --> 00:21:00.968
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

202
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.970
And there is truth in these rocks.

203
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.263
Grant!

204
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:08.309
You're gonna want to see this.

205
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.394
Guys, can you help me?

206
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.397
I'll pack it out.
I'll make sure nobody else crosses it.

207
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.156
Ellie Sattler.

208
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.117
Alan Grant.

209
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.203
You look the same.

210
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.458
And this place, it's so...

211
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.628
So, uh... you.

212
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.549
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming, I would've...

213
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.141
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

214
00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:54.271
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 am,
but iced tea or...

215
00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.773
Tea. Yeah.

216
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.024
Tea. I can do that.

217
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.694
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

218
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:06.200
Well, the funding's dried up,
so somebody's gotta pay for all this.

219
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:07.701
Right. Thank you.

220
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.083
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming.

221
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.376
That's great.

222
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:16.460
Thanks.

223
00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:18.587
Gave me grounds
for some hope for a change.

224
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:20.089
How are your kids?

225
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.215
Mmm.

226
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.969
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.

227
00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.429
They're both in college.
Can you believe that?

228
00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:28.806
And Mark?

229
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:31.892
It's over.

230
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.731
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

231
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:39.233
It's okay.

232
00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.068
I'm back to me.

233
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.195
And my work. You know, it's...

234
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.280
That's great.

235
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.449
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.

236
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.034
Exciting times.

237
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:51.620
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

238
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.330
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

239
00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:54.832
So freeing.

240
00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:58.794
Ellie.

241
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:04.800
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

242
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.222
Well, that's a locust.

243
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:13.017
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

244
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.811
God, the size of it is massive.

245
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.858
It has genes that have been extinct
since the cretaceous.

246
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:24.320
And swarms of them are decimating crops
from Iowa to Texas.

247
00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.322
Terrifying, right?

248
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:28.908
Started as a few hundred.

249
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.076
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

250
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.623
If they keep going, there'll be
no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

251
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:37.875
The entire food chain
would collapse.

252
00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:42.046
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

253
00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:47.051
None of the crops they're eating
are biosyn seed.

254
00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.385
Biosyn.

255
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.888
You're saying biosyn made this?

256
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:54.767
I mean, it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world's food supply.

257
00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.311
Not before a few million starve.

258
00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:01.690
Yeah, what is that saying?
How we're three meals away from anarchy?

259
00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:05.152
If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three meals.

260
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:08.948
So, why are you bringing it to me?

261
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:12.868
I need concrete evidence
Biosyn's responsible for all this.

262
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:16.872
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

263
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.042
But I need a witness.

264
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.294
Alan.

265
00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:25.673
You command respect.
People believe you.

266
00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:27.716
Ellie.

267
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.053
You know why I'm here.
It's quiet. I'm done with all that.

268
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.346
Are you? Okay.

269
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.974
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

270
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:38.686
Nobody gets that luxury anymore,
not even you.

271
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:39.770
And you know what?

272
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.314
You're the one I trust.

273
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:50.572
This biosyn sanctuary is, what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

274
00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:51.991
How do you even get in there?

275
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:55.828
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

276
00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.082
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

277
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:03.585
And he just happened
to invite you out of the blue?

278
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.213
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

279
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.339
Uh-huh.

280
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.763
You coming or what?

281
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.398
It's clear!

282
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.485
Keep it going. That's good.

283
00:25:29.653 --> 00:25:32.197
Every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here

284
00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:34.992
before shipping out
to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.

285
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:38.037
We give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy.

286
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.247
So much security.

287
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.082
Those are just the ones you see.

288
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.376
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

289
00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:48.630
- Hey.
- Your plane's just fueling up.

290
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:52.384
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

291
00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:54.219
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

292
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:57.765
Hello.

293
00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:00.642
You see me? You follow me.

294
00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:03.270
We rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm

295
00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:04.897
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

296
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.067
Shut the whole place down.
Anonymous tip.

297
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.904
Good girl. Yes. Yes.

298
00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:15.783
Alan. You never get used to it.

299
00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:17.576
Okay. We're good. Close it up!

300
00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:19.119
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

301
00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:20.204

Hey.

304
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.662
You look just like blue.

305
00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:06.750
This?

306
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.710
You wanna try it?

307
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.838
Okay.

308
00:27:19.096 --> 00:27:20.430
Huh.

309
00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:26.478
Maisie, don't move.

310
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:31.525
Hey, girl.

311
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.652
Staying out of trouble?

312
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.238
She had a baby. That's impossible.

313
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.952
- Back up.
- She won't hurt us, right?

314
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.495
You're damn right she will.

315
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.038
Just breathe.

316
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:47.624
- If you don't, she'll think you're scared.
- I am scared.

317
00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:51.336
Nah.
She doesn't need to know that.

318
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.763
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie, get inside.

319
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.807
- I'm coming with you.
- What did I just say?

320
00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:16.612
- We gotta move.
- Not yet. We need the girl.

321
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:19.990
Hey, what's up?

322
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.074
Wow.

Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

Where you going?

327
00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:36.882
You can't keep me here.
You're not my mother.

328
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.098
She's leaving the house.

329
00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:10.582
Get in the truck!
Come on! Let's go!

330
00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:11.833
Got it!

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.061
- Tie it down!
- Hold on.

Come on. Let's go!

00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:17.547
- Get in!
- Come on!

They found her.

What? Who are they?

339
00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:08.890
Poachers. I've seen them around.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.892
Leader's a real shit-heel.

341
00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.978

followed me here.

- Where is she?
- Go get the truck.

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.701
Please, please! No, no/

354
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:14.915
This year, man. What's next?

355
00:31:14.998 --> 00:31:16.166
Historically?

356
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:19.544
Uh, darkness, blood, rain of fire.
I think frogs.

357
00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:21.481
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

358
00:31:21.505 --> 00:31:23.507
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

359
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.883
They're eating the corn, wheat.

360
00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:27.010
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

361
00:31:27.094 --> 00:31:28.929
So, we can say goodbye to this.

362
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:33.016
Hello?

363
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.352
Franklin. It's me. You at work?

364
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:37.604
Okay, you're kind of
a subject of interest around here,

365
00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.398
so I can't really be talking to you.

366
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:42.109
Come on. I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.

367
00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:43.443
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

368
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:45.529
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

369
00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:46.738
We 're outside.

370
00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:50.033
Let me talk to him.

371
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.123
- That him?
- That's him.

372
00:31:56.206 --> 00:32:00.293
Name's Rainn Delacourt.
Real piece of work.

373
00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:01.378
What'd he take?

374
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:04.673
Something we care about
very much.

375
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:08.343
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

376
00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:10.262
You can't just take a person, Claire.

377
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.305
- We had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

378
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:15.225
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

379
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:17.894
Where'd you call me from?

380
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.858
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

381
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.569
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.

382
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.070
Was she with him?

383
00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:31.199
There's no mention,
but we have people on the ground already.

384
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.659
One of them you know.

385
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:35.287
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the park went down.

386
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.582
Barry's French intelligence now.

387
00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:41.877
I need to talk to him.

388
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.045
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

389
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.881
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

390
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.175
our guys will see
if Delacourt knows where she is.

391
00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:51.344
Our guys. Not you.

392
00:32:51.428 --> 00:32:55.932
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

393
00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:58.226
Why would I do that?

394
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:01.730
Look, you guys are both crazy,

395
00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:06.276
but you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

396
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.320
She's lucky to have you.

397
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.656
Don't get killed, okay?

398
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:31.343
I think we're almost there.

399
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.345
Yeah.

400
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.985
Dr. Sattler. Dr. Grant.

401
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:51.363
- Ramsay Cole, communications.
- Oh, hey.

402
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:53.698
I have to warn you,
everyone's so excited to have you.

403
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.326
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

404
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:59.162
Mmm. You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

405
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:02.207
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.

406
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.126
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

407
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.379
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

408
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.881
I mean, such motility of thought.
It's incredible.

409
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.758
How much time
have you spent with him?

410
00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:16.012
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

411
00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:18.306
Oh, please. After you.
And watch your head.

412
00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:28.501
Biosyn bought this land
for the Amber deposits back in the '905.

413
00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:30.569
But we've managed
to turn it into a safe haven

414
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.070
for about 20 displaced species.

415
00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:36.074
First generation came from Sorna.
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs are here too.

416
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.994
Took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the T. Rex.

417
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.580
- The...
- The T. Rex is here?

418
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:43.456
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

419
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:46.960
[Arrived just before you guys.

420
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.187
Aerial deterrent system, active.

421
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:09.566
Restricted air space.
Protects the airborne life.

422
00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.985
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.

423
00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:13.069
Airborne?

424
00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:17.240
Is that <i>Dreadnoughtus?</i>

425
00:35:17.324 --> 00:35:18.742
What?

426
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.751
Beautiful, right?

427
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:32.213
The name means "fear nothing."
Well, I guess you know that.

428
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.716
- What do they graze on?
- Hawthorn and fern.

429
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:38.136
All indigenous. Nothing stocked
except for the deer population.

430
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:41.056
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

431
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:43.433
The apex predator?

432
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:45.060
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

433
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:47.228
At least for now.

434
00:35:57.405 --> 00:36:00.075
You don't let people in there, right?

435
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.869
Uh, no. Our... our research...

436
00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:05.830
Our research outposts are connected
completely underground.

437
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.958
If we have to,
we can just herd the animals remotely

438
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:13.296
using a neuro-implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

439
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.798
Like shocks?

440
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.384
Uh... n-no, like signals.

441
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:20.345
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit...

442
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.805
- Cruel?
- Cruel.

443
00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:26.017
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic park?

444
00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:27.977
Yeah.

445
00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:36.903
Please join Dr. LAN Malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall

446
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.780
for the ethics of genetic power.

447
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.949
God, everyone's so young.

448
00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:44.369
Well, it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest.

449
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:45.954
Doctors.

450
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:51.126
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler.
Dr. Grant. Hi.

451
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.336
Wow, this is big. I'm Lewis.

452
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.380
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

453
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:57.233
- You're Lewis Dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

454
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:59.175
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

455
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:01.469
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

456
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.304
- Would you?
- No.

457
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:06.516
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

458
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.017
Would you mind if we, um...

459
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.937
- Just to... it would mean a lot.
- Oh.

460
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.106
Do you wanna, um...

461
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:15.024
- Oh, great. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

462
00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:17.527
- That's good. That's good. Thanks.
- Okay.

463
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.906
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

464
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.702
We are unlocking the true power
of the genome.

465
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:27.120
We're this close. Believe me.

466
00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:28.955
You'll make a fortune with that.

467
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:31.166
No, it's not about money.

468
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.544
No, we've already identified dozens
of applications for paleo-DNA.

469
00:37:34.627 --> 00:37:38.173
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

470
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.799
We will be saving lives.

471
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.760
- But... shh.
- I bet.

472
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:45.930
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself, but, uh, it's...

473
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:49.184
So, you're in more-than-capable hands
with Ramsay.

474
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.395
He's basically a young me.

475
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:57.108
Only smarter and, uh, taller.

476
00:37:57.192 --> 00:37:58.401
Do you have food?

477
00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:01.488
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon? Um...

478
00:38:01.571 --> 00:38:03.573
No, never mind.
I-I'll find something.

479
00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:07.952
So, I want to do more of this
later on, if we, um...

480
00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:10.246
Oh! We booked you
a private pod...

481
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.831
- Right.
- For the trip out, so...

482
00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:14.667
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

483
00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:16.419
You better hurry. Malcolm's on.

484
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.338
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

485
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.381
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.

486
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.675
Thank you for being here. It's...

487
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:27.639
Okay. Um, follow me, please.

488
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:30.850
What?

489
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.648
Human beings have no more right
to safety or Liberty

490
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.651
than any other creature
on this planet.

491
00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:45.615
We not only lack dominion over nature,

492
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.159
we're subordinate to it.

493
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.829
And now, here we are

494
00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:54.082
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips.

495
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.209
And just like nuclear power,

496
00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:59.087
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

497
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.007
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best,

498
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.970
just like you are doing now.

499
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.098
Yep. You.

500
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:16.980
You control the future
of our survival on planet earth.

501
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:19.732
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

502
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:23.194
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

503
00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:27.907
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

504
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:31.786
Unforeseen consequences occur.

505
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:37.333
And every time, every single time...

506
00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:40.795
We all act surprised?

507
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:42.505
Because deep down,

508
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:46.885
I don't think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real.

509
00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.061
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

510
00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:04.027
we must transform human consciousness.

511
00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:08.281
Whoo!

512
00:40:09.282 --> 00:40:10.617
Yeah!

513
00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:13.161
- May am?
- Dr. Malcolm?

514
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:16.080
Very good. There you go.

515
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:17.933
I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

516
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:20.126
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

517
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.086
Look at you,

518
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.965
and look at me, and look at you.

519
00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.717
Wha... this is so trippy.

520
00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:29.969
You look like you're doing well.

521
00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:33.598
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

522
00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:34.933
Expenses add up.

523
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:39.062
You? Alan, are you...
You have any family or...

524
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.523
- No.
- So, I need to talk to you.

525
00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:45.568
Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
Privately.

526
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:47.236
Do you two talk a lot?

527
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.489
- He slid into my DMs.
- He did what?

528
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:51.407
- It's urgent, Ian.
- What did you do?

529
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:53.242
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

530
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:55.745
The doomsday clock might be
about out of time,

531
00:40:55.828 --> 00:41:00.625
but, as they say, it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

532
00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:02.669
What?

533
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:08.132
Locusts altered with cretaceous-era DNA.

534
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.177
- That's not my field.
- But if these things continue to multiply,

535
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.430
we're talking about
cascading system-wide effects, LAN.

536
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:15.974
Gosh, that's a drag.

537
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:18.226
- What is the matter with you?
- "Drag"?

538
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.349
Why, is there something special
you wanted me to do?

539
00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:22.772
- How about give a damn?
- You know too much not to care.

540
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:26.025
Hey, I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

541
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:29.821
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation,

542
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:34.075
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and, uh...

543
00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.703
You know,
just like we always do, squander it.

544
00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:39.872
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

545
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:42.667
Can I offer you guys some Joe?

546
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.129
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

547
00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:47.547
I don't want a cappuccino.

548
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.465
I could do, like, a cortado
or macchiato...

549
00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:52.510
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag.
This is gonna perk you right up.

550
00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:00.435
The locusts are part of a larger project
called Hexapod allies.

551
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.186
- I...
- You're right about their intent.

552
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.188
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

553
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:06.774
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

554
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:10.028
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to. It's crescendoing.

555
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:11.404
They're proliferating wildly.

556
00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:13.990
They're lasting three,
four times longer than they should.

557
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:17.660
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

558
00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:19.412
Downstairs, Sublevel six.

559
00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.456
That's where they keep
the locusts.

560
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.875
Look for a lab marked L4.

561
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.793
But wait, how are we
gonna get down there?

562
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:28.546
This looks so silky.
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

563
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.630
Sure.

564
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:31.632
You know what it is?
Don't tell me. This is...

565
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.218
- You won't know it.
- Sustainable bamboo.

566
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:36.554
- It is sustainable bamboo.
- That's why I said...

567
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:37.930
- How'd you know?
- I just know.

568
00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:39.348
- It's amazing.
- Very amazing.

569
00:42:39.432 --> 00:42:40.433
I've got cumin, cinnamon.

570
00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:42.310
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

571
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.713
- I've got five-spice...
- Doctor.

572
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.438
If you're into that kind of feel.

573
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:47.940
- Um, and let's talk milks.
- Yeah.

574
00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:50.026
Okay, soy milk, yes?

575
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:53.196
- No.
- What just happened?

576
00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:55.615
We're in.

577
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:11.839
Sublevel Six. Restricted.

578
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:20.723
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

579
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:24.727
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

580
00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:27.605
They're multiplying like crazy
and they're not dying.

581
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:30.191
- What part of this don't you understand?
- I do understand.

582
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.026
This is gonna be a global famine.

583
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.487
Hey, hey,
we can't anticipate everything.

584
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.447
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

585
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.407
- What?
- All of them.

586
00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:39.742
- No.no.
- Like...

587
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:42.120
- Henry, we don't want to cause a panic.
- Like yesterday.

588
00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:43.871
We want control.

589
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:45.998
There's no such thing.

590
00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.804
When we're afraid,

591
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:01.973
what do we do?

592
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.641
What have we done before?

593
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.685
We follow through.

594
00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:08.396
That's what we do.

595
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.480
Right?

596
00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.317
Right.

597
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:18.156
We found the girl.

598
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:19.615
She's en route.

599
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.868
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

600
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:24.453
- Wait, you found her?
- Yeah, found them both.

601
00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:25.830
Her and the little raptor.

602
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:31.002
Blue reproduced all on her own,
just like you said.

603
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.211
You're so smart, Henry.

604
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.299
That's why this works.

605
00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:39.177
You understand the value
of these creatures.

606
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.678
You always have. I do too.

607
00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:44.640
We don't stop because of a, what,
little side project went south?

608
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.354
Hey, if they trace the locusts back to us,

609
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:51.856
they come for the dinosaurs.

610
00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:53.274
All your work, gone.

611
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:57.195
Billions of dollars in assets, gone.

612
00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:01.282
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

613
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.744
You really think
she's the solution?

614
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:08.956
Okay.

615
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:13.169
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

616
00:45:15.504 --> 00:45:16.839
Is she all right?

617
00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.216
She better be.

618
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:22.470
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

619
00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.232
I said I'd call you.

620
00:45:34.315 --> 00:45:35.608
They land yet?

621
00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:37.235
Second plane is incoming.

622
00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:40.071
- Who said anything about a second plane?
- We flew them separately.

623
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:41.948
I'm not taking any chances.

624
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:43.866
And we'll need payment before delivery.

625
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.993
I didn't like what happened last time.

626
00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:49.288
Okay. Okay, just call me when it's done.

627
00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:00.841
You said I was going some place safe.

628
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.094
You are.

629
00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:13.688
- Walk to the car.
- No.

630
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.564
It's not a choice.

631
00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:31.497
Fifty grand to fly one little raptor.

632
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.581
Not bad.

633
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:40.339
What's with the girl?

634
00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.427
Not your problem.

635
00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:53.811
Pleasure doing business.

636
00:46:58.024 --> 00:46:59.358
We're ready.
Let's go.

637
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.616
Owen.

638
00:47:12.371 --> 00:47:13.372
Hi, Claire.

639
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:16.625
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

640
00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:20.463
I tried. My cousin and I opened a café.
I lasted three weeks.

641
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:23.549
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

642
00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:26.469
<i>Delacourt was hired by Soyona Santos,</i>

643
00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:28.554
a broker
in the underground dinosaur trade.

644
00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:30.848
We don't have intel on his cargo,

645
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:34.477
but once they make the exchange,
we'll see what they know about your girl.

646
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.938
You can listen in,
but promise me you will not make contact.

647
00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.595
<i>There is a big underground market
for dinosaurs now.</i>

648
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:49.450
<i>Europe, middle east, Northern Africa,
it all comes through here.</i>

649
00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:02.380
Don't look at anyone,
don't talk to anyone.

650
00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:04.298
Just try to blend in.

651
00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:42.336
I'm okay.

652
00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:56.600
Still flying for Santos, huh?

653
00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:57.768
You must need money.

654
00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:58.853
What's it to you?

655
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.980
I've got cargo.

656
00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:04.233
A thousand kilos of dinosaur
to Palermo.

657
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.110
I give you two thousands.

658
00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:08.571
2,000? How much is there?

659
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.748
You lost?

660
00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:21.500
You're American.

661
00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:24.462
And that make us friends?

662
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:27.631
- Listen, I just got here and...
- Oh, no.

663
00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:29.633
That was not an invitation. Here.

664
00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.053
Souvenir.

665
00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:36.432
Go back to the hotel, you know,
throw some bath salts in a bath.

666
00:49:36.515 --> 00:49:39.351
This place, not your vibe.

667
00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:40.436
Wait.

668
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:42.813
- Look.
- Claire.

669
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:44.690
Claire.

670
00:49:44.773 --> 00:49:46.567
I know this must feel exotic,

671
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.070
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here, you disappear.

672
00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:51.155
You feel me?

673
00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:53.240
Good luck, okay?

674
00:49:53.324 --> 00:49:54.617
Wait.

675
00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:58.496
- Wait.
- What is this?

676
00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.581
- I need your help.
- I don't know you.

677
00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.875
- I'm looking for someone.
- Don't do that.

678
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:04.877
She is all alone. Please.

679
00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:13.010
- That your daughter?
- Yes.

680
00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:17.223
Sorry, I can't get involved.

681
00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:39.036
- Think I got him.
- Target on the move.

682
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:42.248
That's our undercover agent
with him.

683
00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:44.208
Claire, he's headed underground.

684
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.691
<i>- You see him?</i>
- Yeah, I've got him.

685
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.171
All right, let's go.

686
00:50:49.255 --> 00:50:51.549
<i>Team four,
need you to sweep spreading south.</i>

687
00:50:51.632 --> 00:50:52.967
Come on!

688
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:58.055
<i>All units, take up bull's-eye position.</i>

689
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.433
This is bravo one.

690
00:51:01.517 --> 00:51:03.894
<i>Primary target in sight.
No sign of the girl.</i>

691
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.771
<i>Alpha team, stand clear.</i>

692
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.368
My people say the raptor arrived
in good condition.

693
00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:22.121
You boys didn't cock this up.

694
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:23.914
Color me amazed.

695
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:27.293
I do have another job for you.
Short hop, money's double.

696
00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:28.752
What's the cargo?

697
00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:32.506
<i>Atrociraptors.</i>

698
00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:34.466
Thoroughbreds.

699
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.801
Trained to kill.

700
00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:38.554
- Kill who?
- Whoever they're told.

701
00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:41.890
Laser marks the target, they attach
to the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

702
00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:43.350
Inescapable.

703
00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:45.644
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

704
00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:49.565
You can't engineer loyalty.
You have to nurture it.

705
00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:51.900
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

706
00:51:51.984 --> 00:51:54.069
In or out?

707
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:55.988
She's not here.

708
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:01.535
Where are we going?

709
00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:03.871
Almost there.

710
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.438
<i>- That's the drop, let's go!
- Need eyes on...</i>

711
00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:13.631
Weapons down! Eyes on them!

712
00:52:13.714 --> 00:52:15.090
Hands in the air! Contact made!

713
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:17.551
Delacourt, on the floor now!

714
00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:18.636
Get on the ground!

715
00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.429
Delacourt! Stay with him!

716
00:52:20.512 --> 00:52:21.680
Shit.

717
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.767
Get that truck out of here!

718
00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.393
There goes Santos!

719
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:34.151
<i>Damn, we lost delacourt.</i>

720
00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:49.667
This is bravo one.
Truck is approaching the underpass.

721
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.503
Go.

722
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:56.650
[Gasps}

723
00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:22.801
The girl, where is she?
Where did they take her?

724
00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:24.303
- Get it off!
- Where is she?

725
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:27.264
I don't know! We handed her off to Santos.

726
00:54:27.347 --> 00:54:29.475
I don't know
where they took her after that.

727
00:54:42.738 --> 00:54:45.073
Claire, it's Santos, the woman in white.

728
00:54:45.157 --> 00:54:46.157
I'll find her.

729
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:49.119
- Spread out.
- Bravo team, watch your six.

730
00:54:51.413 --> 00:54:53.791
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Hold it!

731
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:56.668
- Let them out.
- What?

732
00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:58.545
You heard me.

733
00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:25.072
<i>Merde..</i>

734
00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.424
<i>Claire, do you have her?</i>

735
00:55:58.313 --> 00:56:00.440
- We had some trouble.
- What kind?

736
00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:03.819
<i>The parents, Grady and Dearing.
They're here.</i>

737
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:10.784
- Can you take care of it?
- Not for free.

738
00:56:10.868 --> 00:56:13.161
Well, do it.

739
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:28.510
Okay, okay. Listen.

740
00:56:28.594 --> 00:56:29.970
Oh!

741
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.054
No, no, no!

742
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:39.062
[Gasps}

743
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:45.861
You don't use it on people.

744
00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:47.070
Where's my daughter?

745
00:56:47.779 --> 00:56:49.489
She wasn't yours to begin with.

746
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.160
Tell me.

747
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.079
Biosyn.

748
00:56:56.163 --> 00:56:58.165
They're taking her to biosyn.

749
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.715
You missed her.

750
00:57:06.798 --> 00:57:08.216
She's gone.

751
00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:01.603
Take my hand. Come on.

752
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.760
Hold on tight.

753
00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:35.470
What?

754
00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:48.584
Do you remember how we used
to get the raptors in the truck?

755
00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:49.609
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

756
00:58:51.695 --> 00:58:52.863
- You're up.
- No.

757
00:58:53.572 --> 00:58:55.949
At the last minute, dive roll.

758
00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:58.285
- I don't dive roll.
- You'll be fine.

759
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.829
I never got the timing right.

760
00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:04.708
- Now?
- Any minute. Any minute now.

761
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:07.377
- Now?
- No.

762
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.089
Now!

763
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.428
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

764
00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:18.889
Freeze!

765
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.107
I'm flying us out of here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

766
00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:30.525
You ever flown to biosyn?

767
00:59:32.194 --> 00:59:33.987
<i>Owen! They took her to Biosyn.</i>

768
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.136
<i>There is an airfield
on the north side of the island.</i>

769
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.368
Go.

770
00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:39.826
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

771
01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:07.854
Right!

772
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:13.819
Heads up!

773
01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:54.461
We made a lot of enemies today.
We gotta go.

774
01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.712
- He'll be here.
- Uh-huh.

775
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:01.801
Out of time, out of time.

776
01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.180
There he is.

777
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.643
- Pull over.
- That's not how planes work.

778
01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.275
Open the back.

779
01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:37.337
Come on!

780
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.427
Hold on tight!

781
01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.737
Oh, sh...

782
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.709
Still got it.

783
01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.104
Kayla watts.

784
01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.315
You're welcome.

785
01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.775
You don't look like you fly for biosyn.

786
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:44.529
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

787
01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:47.324
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

788
01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:49.868
Those don't work. They broke.

789
01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:54.497
I'll take you all to biosyn,
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

790
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.584
You're willing to risk your life
for people you never met?

791
01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:01.129
You wanna ask questions,
or you want a ride?

792
01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.676
We'll take the ride.

793
01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:16.019
So this is
our habitat development lab.

794
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.730
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

795
01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.274
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form,

796
01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:25.403
and I mean complete, untouched genomes,
like <i>Moros Intrepidus.</i>

797
01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:26.738
- What?
- Yeah.

798
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.991
Wow.

799
01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.080
What about splicing DNA?

800
01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.915
You know, creating new species.

801
01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:39.834
Oh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

802
01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.358
We like to think we're more evolved.

803
01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.539
Looks like we still have
some time left before your ride.

804
01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.971
Uh, would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves?

805
01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.226
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.

806
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.620
- Yeah, why not?
- Great.

807
01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:02.148
I'll meet you guys at the hyper-loop,
station three in about 30 minutes.

808
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.818
Elevators are down this hall,
not those.

809
01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.362
Those lead you
down to the Sublevels.

810
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.590
You need special clearance
to get down there.

811
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.074
- Oh, okay.
- Thirty minutes.

812
01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.710
Here. Take this.

813
01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:26.047
Okay?

814
01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.132
Yep.

815
01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.685
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

816
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:41.813
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

817
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.108
Claire should never have
hidden you away.

818
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.318
You're way too important, Maisie.

819
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.489
You took her too?

820
01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.493
Yeah.

821
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.830
We needed her
to help us understand you.

822
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.795
Hey, beta.

823
01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.631
You okay?

824
01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:11.509
Did you say "beta"? Is that her name?

825
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.386
I gave it to her.

826
01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.430
Beta is pretty special.

827
01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.307
You know, when we made blue,

828
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.560
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

829
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.522
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

830
01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:28.526
So beta and blue
are genetically identical,

831
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.504
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

832
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.197
Charlotte.

833
01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:36.534
What do you know about Charlotte?

834
01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.161
She died.

835
01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:40.747
A long time ago.

836
01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.500
It broke my grandpa's heart.

837
01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:46.753
So he made me.

838
01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.507
No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't.

839
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.094
Charlotte made you.

840
01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.767
<i>I'm so excited for everyone to see
what we've been doing here.</i>

841
01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:05.939
<i>There is new technology being made,
new science, like, every day almost.</i>

842
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:10.068
<i>And it's great to be in the center of...
Center of that.</i>

843
01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:16.366
Charlotte lived on site B
with all of us till the storm.

844
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.577
She loved dinosaurs.

845
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.871
- <i>Charlotte, be careful.
- Yeah, I will.</i>

846
01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.915
She grew up around scientists.

847
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.251
And eventually...

848
01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.712
She became one herself.

849
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.006
<i>A butterfly flew
into my office this morning.</i>

850
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.386
<i>They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree wholeheartedly.</i>

851
01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.470
She was brilliant.

852
01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.223
<i>For all my work with creatures,
wings flapping...</i>

853
01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.933
In ways that I'll never be.

854
01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:45.812
<i>In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?</i>

855
01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.357
<i>And if it's possible, what makes it so?</i>

856
01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.030
<i>I've lost my pen.</i>

857
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.077
Is that me?

858
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.580
Yeah.

859
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:07.292
Just like blue, Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

860
01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.879
She created you with her own DNA.

861
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.216
So I do have a mother.

862
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.469
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

863
01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.097
He was protecting her, and you.

864
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:23.766
And we're the same?

865
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.978
You were.

866
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:31.232
When you were a baby, Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

867
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.985
That's how she died.

868
01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:36.696
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

869
01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:39.407
- Do I have it too?
- No.

870
01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.161
She changed your DNA.

871
01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.790
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

872
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.044
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

873
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.421
She fixed me.

874
01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.007
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

875
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.803
Your DNA could change the world.

876
01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:05.892
And I have to know how she did it,
but I just can't replicate her work.

877
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:10.813
If I could just study you and beta,
whose DNA was never changed, I could...

878
01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:16.361
Fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

879
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.237
What kind of mistake?

880
01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:28.748
<i>Sublevel Six. Restricted.</i>

881
01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:34.629
Thanks for coming.

882
01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:42.845
- Which lab did Malcolm say?
- L4.

883
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:48.810
This is it.

884
01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:11.958
Okay. Get in,
get the sample and get out.

885
01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.042
And move slow.

886
01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.586
They can swarm
at the slightest disturbance.

887
01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:41.988
Orthoptera.

888
01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:44.782
Two weeks.

889
01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.581
Fully mature. This one.

890
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.835
Ready? Easy.

891
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.717
Okay. Go.

892
01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:05.386
What?

893
01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.181
Go get it.

894
01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.517
Is that necessary?

895
01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.020
Wh-what did you think was gonna happen?

896
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:17.231
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

897
01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:20.443
Alan, you said there was no time.
Can you get it?

898
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.361
Of course I can get it.

899
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:24.781
Okay. Easy.

900
01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:28.493
Watch its legs.

901
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.537
Ugh. Yech.

902
01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.080
Here we go.

903
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.502
They're cell signaling between them.
This is not good, Ellie.

904
01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.753
I almost got it.

905
01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:45.301
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

906
01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.845
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

907
01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:51.265
<i>Charlotte lock wood believed
the methods used at Jurassic park</i>

908
01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.350
<i>could cure disease.</i>

909
01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.185
<i>She was right.</i>

910
01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:58.439
<i>Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome with altered DNA,</i>

911
01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:02.193
<i>she used a pathogen to deliver

912
01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:06.906
<i>if I can repurpose what she did,
I could change the locust DNA,</i>

913
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.242
<i>eradicating them in a single generation.</i>

914
01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.537
Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

915
01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:22.296
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

916
01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.510
What the...

917
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.288
Got it.

918
01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.398
Oh, my god!

919
01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.149
They're everywhere! Help me!

920
01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:45.111
Oh, god! No!

921
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.448
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

922
01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.539
Maisie.

923
01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.028
<i>Asset containment breach.</i>

924
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.512
<i>Please remain at your stations.</i>

925
01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.601
<i>Asset containment breach.
Please remain at your stations.</i>

926
01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.396
Oh, my god.

927
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.523
- Oh, god. I can't see!
- Where's the key?

928
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.361
Oh, god!

929
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:41.626
You okay?

930
01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.462
Yeah. You?

931
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.422
Yeah.

932
01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.384
Oh.

933
01:13:56.057 --> 01:14:00.603
You're Dr. Ellie sattler and Alan Grant.

934
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.146
You were at Jurassic park.

935
01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.857
What are you doing here?

936
01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.859
What? What...

937
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.694
What are you doing here?

938
01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.573
I'm Maisie lock wood.

939
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:25.461
Uh, hey, we don't, uh...

940
01:14:26.504 --> 01:14:28.547
We're not...
We don't work for biosyn.

941
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.757
I can tell.

942
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.301
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

943
01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.569
Okay. In and out.
We find your girl and go.

944
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.574
Tower, this is N141. Request to land
for freight delivery. Over.

945
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.159
N141, negative.

946
01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.996
We've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

947
01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:03.749
<i>Copy that, tower.
Be advised shipment is perishable.</i>

948
01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.168
<i>We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency. Over.</i>

949
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.253
There isn't... no.

950
01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.423
Negative.
Return to point of origin.

951
01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:13.551
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

952
01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.803
<i>May need to check systems.</i>

953
01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:17.805
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

954
01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.017
Who is this? Is this Denise?

955
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.770
<i>You do not want me to start spilling
secrets, Denise. You remember Dubrovnik</i>

956
01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:27.732
she's...

957
01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:31.235
Different Denise, in accounts.

958
01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:42.079
Talked to Santos.
It's the girl's parents.

959
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.667
Let's shut off the ads.

960
01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.377
Are you sure?

961
01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:50.588
Uh-huh.

962
01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.721
What's that?

963
01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.475
That's the, uh...
That's the aerial deterrent system.

964
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.311
- Keeps the airborne life away.
- Why is it blinking?

965
01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.438
Dead ass Denise in the tower
just turned it off.

966
01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.732
We gotta get out of this airspace
right now.

967
01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:17.031
- That's another plane, right?
- Not exactly.

968
01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.661
- Is that a...
<i>- Quetzalcoatlus.</i>

969
01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.372
Late cretaceous,
should have stayed there.

970
01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:34.006
Okay. Okay.

971
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.133
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

972
01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:54.902
This plane is going down!

973
01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:58.030
If you're gonna eject,
you need to do it now!

974
01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:01.117
- I only got one chair, and she's in it.
- You don't have parachutes?

975
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.369
I wasn't expecting company!

976
01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:13.921
Claire! We gotta get you off this plane.

977
01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.089
What?

978
01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.882
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

979
01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:19.718
If it doesn't, you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

980
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.054
Claire!
If it doesn't open automatically,

981
01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:24.140
you're gonna pull
this lever behind you. Okay?

982
01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.683
Ten thousand feet!

983
01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:27.768
Hey, you're the one
who's gotta go to get to her.

984
01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:29.812
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

985
01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:34.024
I'll see you again.

986
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.111
I love you.

987
01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:27.953
What's the plan?

988
01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.956
Whatever happens. That's the plan.

989
01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:46.513
- Three.
- This way.

990
01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.059
- Alan, we need the code.
- Let's try this thing.

991
01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.142
Yeah.

992
01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:53.103
Get down.

993
01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.278
- Thank god it's you!
- I know.

994
01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.113
- This place is a maze.
- Good you're here.

995
01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:05.324
We were so confused.
I thought we were lost.

996
01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.576
Then you said station three.
And I was like, here...

997
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.869
Do you have the sample?

998
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.060
- What?
- What are you talking about?

999
01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:12.873
The DNA sample. Do you have it?

1000
01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:15.501
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1001
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.670
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1002
01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.213
I'm here to help you.

1003
01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:20.381
Do you have it?

1004
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.341
Yeah.

1005
01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.425
Good.

1006
01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.178
This pod will take you
to the airfield.

1007
01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.888
We have a plane ready to fly.

1008
01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.391
- Ian told you about Hexapod allies?
- No.

1009
01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:31.642
I told him.

1010
01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:32.726
What?

1011
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.312
- Okay. You guys gotta go.
- Wait.

1012
01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:40.985
Maisie.

1013
01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:45.698
Maisie Lockwood.

1014
01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.660
Okay.

1015
01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.542
That was my baby.

1016
01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.920
Okay, okay.

1017
01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:16.969
Where'd you learn to fly?

1018
01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.472
Uh, air force.
Legacy on my mama's side.

1019
01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:21.890
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1020
01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.185
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

1021
01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:27.271
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1022
01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:30.232
but it didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home.

1023
01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:33.068
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

1024
01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.072
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1025
01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:38.949
Is that why you're helping us?

1026
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.122
I was there
when they handed your girl off to biosyn.

1027
01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:49.876
I could have said something, but I didn't.

1028
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.670
And when I saw her picture...

1029
01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.424
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1030
01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:02.472
Thank you.

1031
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.479
No.

1032
01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:56.276
Nope.

1033
01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:21.843
What an asshole.

1034
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:14.312
You good?

1035
01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:17.566
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1036
01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.651
Nah. Nah, no.

1037
01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.448
Ejection seat beacon.
We'll find her.

1038
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.491
Okay, okay.

1039
01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:27.826
You really love her, huh?

1040
01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:30.912
Yeah.

1041
01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:32.622
I get it.

1042
01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:35.625
I like redheads too.

1043
01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:38.336
What? God.

1044
01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.968
- Who is that?
- It's Grant and sattler.

1045
01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:47.304
- Is this live?
- Twelve minutes ago.

1046
01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:50.265
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

1047
01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.225
They stole a DNA sample.

1048
01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:53.977
How'd they get in there?

1049
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.688
They used an access key.
Yankee white clearance.

1050
01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:01.526
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in Sattler's pocket.

1051
01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:05.572
All right.
I want to see him.

1052
01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:07.449
And get Ramsay up here too,
will you?

1053
01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.536
- Where are they now?
- On the way to the airfield.

1054
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.663
They caught the hyper-loop
right on schedule.

1055
01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:20.837
How are you?

1056
01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:23.799
You all right?

1057
01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:26.134
Not really, no.

1058
01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:29.513
Hey.

1059
01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:32.682
I, uh, knew your mom.

1060
01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:37.312
You did?

1061
01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:38.688
Mm-hmm.

1062
01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:43.109
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1063
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:46.905
she came to my university to lecture,

1064
01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.991
and we became good friends.

1065
01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.118
What was she like?

1066
01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:53.286
Brilliant.

1067
01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:56.498
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1068
01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:58.792
And she had a conscience.

1069
01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:01.002
While they were out
building theme parks,

1070
01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:04.756
well, she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

1071
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.759
And I was her experiment.

1072
01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:14.266
She wanted a child more than anything.

1073
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.477
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1074
01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:20.188
A full life.

1075
01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:25.026
I didn't know her long,

1076
01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:28.238
but I know she loved you very much.

1077
01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:49.885
What's happening?

1078
01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:56.933
This must be the old Amber mines.

1079
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:01.479
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1080
01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:29.591
Hey, I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1081
01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:33.094
Yeah. No, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle. Listen...

1082
01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:35.263
- You rang?
- Oh, good.

1083
01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.724
Dr. Malcolm, you are...

1084
01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.976
- Fired.
- What?

1085
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:43.480
It was such a cushy gig.

1086
01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:48.068
You can give your access key to security
if you still have it.

1087
01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:50.737
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the Amber mines.

1088
01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.280
What?

1089
01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.699
Wow. This day.

1090
01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.660
Uh, which... which pod are we...

1091
01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:57.827
Are there, um...

1092
01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:00.580
Dinosaurs in the mines?

1093
01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:02.165
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1094
01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:04.876
Technically, birds are dinosaurs,
g-genetically speaking at least.

1095
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.128
Okay.
Lewis, Grant and sattler are in this pod.

1096
01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:10.256
- We need to send a security team asap.
- Absolutely, Ramsay. Thank you.

1097
01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.343
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.
We can take care of it.

1098
01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:14.552
Thank you, doctor.

1099
01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:17.055
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1100
01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:21.226
Uh, I'm not sure
I admire your tone right now.

1101
01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.828
- You need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

1102
01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:26.231
But first,
I owe all these folks an apology.

1103
01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:29.109
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint,

1104
01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.987
I might've made it seem
as if biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1105
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.238
That's enough, Ian.

1106
01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.489
See, here's how they get you.

1107
01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.853
They give you so many promotions
in a short period of time

1108
01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.244
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1109
01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:40.328
Oh, my god.

1110
01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:43.581
Then there are doors that you don't open,
things that you ignore.

1111
01:31:43.665 --> 01:31:49.212
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1112
01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:51.297
Is there an actual concern here,
or are you just...

1113
01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:55.427
You're racing toward the extinction
of our species, and you don't care.

1114
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:58.555
You know exactly what you're doing,
but you won't stop.

1115
01:31:58.638 --> 01:31:59.681
You can't.

1116
01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:03.518
I thought you might be different,
but you're just like everyone else.

1117
01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:05.061
You see what you want to see.

1118
01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:09.315
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1119
01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:13.319
You envision, what,
an evil, unbound pro me the us,

1120
01:32:13.403 --> 01:32:15.739
- so that's what I am to you?
- Prometheus got gored.

1121
01:32:15.822 --> 01:32:18.867
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1122
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:22.579
Ramsay, will you help Dr. Malcolm
gather his things?

1123
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.790
His room, and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1124
01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:36.718
Dodgson.

1125
01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:11.980
<i>Allosaurus?</i>

1126
01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:15.150
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1127
01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.152
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1128
01:34:18.027 --> 01:34:20.488
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1129
01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:22.448
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1130
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:55.648
Did you feel that?

1131
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:58.818
That's an air current.

1132
01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.362
Must be an opening up ahead.

1133
01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.616
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1134
01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:06.492
Just breathe.

1135
01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:08.953
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1136
01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:10.837
- Who said anything about bats?
- I hate bats.

1137
01:35:10.914 --> 01:35:13.333
Well, there's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1138
01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:16.836
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1139
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.172
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1140
01:35:19.255 --> 01:35:22.425
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1141
01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:25.386
- You were happy in your element.
- What? What? Ellie.

1142
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.471
What?

1143
01:35:27.305 --> 01:35:28.473
I wasn't happy.

1144
01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:31.184
You weren't?

1145
01:35:31.267 --> 01:35:33.269
- Do you guys have kids?
- What?

1146
01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:37.357
Uh... no. I-I do. Two.

1147
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:38.983
But not with him?

1148
01:35:40.902 --> 01:35:43.571
No.

1149
01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:46.866
No, just old friends.

1150
01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:49.327
Uh, just old friends.

1151
01:35:50.536 --> 01:35:51.537
Really?

1152
01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.711
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1153
01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:02.090
A map. That looks like an old map.
You don't have a new map?

1154
01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:05.051
There's an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine.

1155
01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:06.761
- If your friends make it out...
- If?

1156
01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:08.304
- When they make it out.
- Yes, sir.

1157
01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:09.639
That's where they'll be.

1158
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:12.517
These roads are protected, right?

1159
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.851
Uh, yeah, I'd drive fast.

1160
01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:26.698
You did good.

1161
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:30.368
Yeah. Well, actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1162
01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:32.537
Not yet.

1163
01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:44.966
Watch yourself.

1164
01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:05.695
- Ellie?
- Yeah.

1165
01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:11.909
What was that?

1166
01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.209
Be careful.

1167
01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.434
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

1168
01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.037
Forget the hat!

1169
01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:59.165
Come on!

1170
01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:07.924
Go, go, go!

1171
01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:10.468
Go, go, go, go, go!

1172
01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:14.555
There's no button.

1173
01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:16.349
It's a car.

1174
01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:20.353
- Oh, my god. Ian!
- Ian, over here!

1175
01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:23.123
- Help!
- Please!

1176
01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.982
- Open the gate!
- Please help us!

1177
01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:28.542
- Do you know the code?
- I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1178
01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.365
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1179
01:38:32.448 --> 01:38:33.991
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1180
01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:37.286
The brake! Pull the brake!

1181
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:39.122
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1182
01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:40.373
Push your legs against it!

1183
01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.293
- 1984.
- Come on, Ian!

1184
01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.671
- Kick up against it!
- Hurry!

1185
01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:50.550
Miles Davis's birthday, 0526.

1186
01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:56.597
- Ian!
- Please. Please.

1187
01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:59.350
- Do something!
- We're not gonna make it.

1188
01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:01.436
Let's... let's all try to stay positive.

1189
01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:20.746
- Please!
- I know. I know. I know!

1190
01:39:27.003 --> 01:39:28.463
Oh, my god!

1191
01:39:30.089 --> 01:39:31.883
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1192
01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:40.516
- Ian, this is Maisie.
- Hi, Maisie.

1193
01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.185
We got the DNA.

1194
01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.730
- We need to get out of this valley.
- Yeah.

1195
01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.565
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1196
01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:11.672
[Gasps}

1197
01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:20.556
Come on. Come on.

1198
01:41:30.376 --> 01:41:31.836
Go on. Get!

1199
01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:34.005
Yuck.

1200
01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:35.965
Hey.

1201
01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:37.341
Oh, my god.

1202
01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:40.052
I thought you were dead.

1203
01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:41.387
What do they even eat?

1204
01:41:46.559 --> 01:41:47.768
We better get inside.

1205
01:42:29.018 --> 01:42:30.144
Go ahead.

1206
01:43:09.558 --> 01:43:11.894
<i>Containment chamber compromised</i>

1207
01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:28.911
Its locked.

1208
01:43:28.994 --> 01:43:31.288
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.

1209
01:43:43.092 --> 01:43:45.553
That can't be right.

1210
01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:58.858
- Is that...
- Oh, no.

1211
01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:01.152
Oh, my god.

1212
01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:05.114
He's burning the evidence.

1213
01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:09.326
-Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, mil"
-that's bananas.

1214
01:44:25.509 --> 01:44:28.262
Oh, my god.

1215
01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:33.267
I... I know that
this may seem precarious, but...

1216
01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:35.561
No, we're teetering.

1217
01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:40.483
Shouldn't we all lean
to the left or something?

1218
01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:42.735
That's a very constructive...
Thank you, Maisie.

1219
01:44:42.818 --> 01:44:44.236
Yeah.

1220
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.155
Slow. Slow.

1221
01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:49.492
Slow.

1222
01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:53.621
- Yay.
- [Gasps}

1223
01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:56.290
- we're fine. See this?
- Mm-hmm.

1224
01:44:57.458 --> 01:44:58.459
- This is fine.
- Mm-hmm.

1225
01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:13.849
Alan?

1226
01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:16.227
Alan!

1227
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.311
How is everybody?

1228
01:45:27.112 --> 01:45:29.240
It's my parents.

1229
01:45:30.491 --> 01:45:31.867
Help!

1230
01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:34.078
- Help!
- Listen.

1231
01:45:34.703 --> 01:45:35.955
Help!

1232
01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:38.916
Oh, god.

1233
01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:43.462
Oh, my god.

1234
01:45:44.255 --> 01:45:45.506
You're okay.

1235
01:45:46.632 --> 01:45:48.008
You're okay.

1236
01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.845
You came to get me. You actually...
You came to get me.

1237
01:45:50.928 --> 01:45:53.180
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1238
01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:54.765
- Hey.
- Of course.

1239
01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:58.269
I remember you.

1240
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:01.939
Remember you too.

1241
01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.617
They helped me escape.

1242
01:46:14.368 --> 01:46:15.369
Yeah?

1243
01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:20.082
You okay?

1244
01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:24.837
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1245
01:46:27.464 --> 01:46:28.757
We gotta go.

1246
01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:31.844
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1247
01:46:33.012 --> 01:46:34.638
Hope nobody is afraid of heights.

1248
01:46:47.693 --> 01:46:49.278
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

1249
01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:09.089
What is that?

1250
01:47:09.882 --> 01:47:11.175
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1251
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:15.679
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1252
01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:36.867
Maisie, Maisie.
Look at me. Look at me.

1253
01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:01.517
Go.

1254
01:48:17.116 --> 01:48:18.826
- Go, go, go.
- Come on!

1255
01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:25.958
No! No, no, no.

1256
01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:32.464
- Hustle!
- I'm gonna die!

1257
01:48:32.548 --> 01:48:33.882
- Climb! Climb, kid!
- No!

1258
01:48:33.966 --> 01:48:36.010
You're not. No, you're not.
You're okay.

1259
01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.061
Go, go, go.

1260
01:49:03.954 --> 01:49:05.205
Come on.

1261
01:49:14.548 --> 01:49:16.216
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1262
01:49:33.025 --> 01:49:34.193
Help me open it.

1263
01:49:40.449 --> 01:49:41.617
I got ya.

1264
01:49:42.493 --> 01:49:44.244
Go, go, go.

1265
01:49:44.328 --> 01:49:45.329
Go, go, go!

1266
01:49:48.457 --> 01:49:49.458
Run!

1267
01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:07.976
See? Not so bad.

1268
01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:15.608
Come on.

1269
01:50:16.693 --> 01:50:18.362
- Owen!
- Claire!

1270
01:51:01.947 --> 01:51:04.992
Call an evacuation.
We need to bring the animals inside.

1271
01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:07.703
The regulations are clear
that in the event of a level two...

1272
01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:09.204
Shh!

1273
01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:11.915
Jeffrey.

1274
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:18.630
God...

1275
01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:20.382
Damn it!

1276
01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:23.969
Just...

1277
01:51:25.387 --> 01:51:27.264
Just call it.

1278
01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:30.934
Attention, attention.
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1279
01:51:31.018 --> 01:51:33.145
Remote herding system
is now active.

1280
01:51:33.228 --> 01:51:36.481
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1281
01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:03.300
I can't get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire.

1282
01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:06.386
- Dr. Sattler, get some water.
- Oh, thanks.

1283
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:08.597
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1284
01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:11.600
I'm Owen Grady.
Big fan. I read your book.

1285
01:52:12.226 --> 01:52:13.644
Well, book on tape.

1286
01:52:13.727 --> 01:52:17.439
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.
Yeah, I know who you are.

1287
01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:20.192
You trained raptors.

1288
01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:23.278
I tried. Yeah.

1289
01:52:23.362 --> 01:52:25.447
- How you doing?
- The one here.

1290
01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:28.367
You were at Jurassic world.

1291
01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:32.663
Jurassic world? Not a fan.
Mm-mmm.

1292
01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:36.583
Okay.
So, we good to find a way out of here?

1293
01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:38.961
- Yep.
- Let's get it.

1294
01:52:39.044 --> 01:52:42.297
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1295
01:52:42.381 --> 01:52:45.050
We turn the ads back on, we go home.

1296
01:52:45.133 --> 01:52:47.594
- Wait. What's an ads?
- Aerial deterrent system.

1297
01:52:49.221 --> 01:52:51.640
You know?
For the pterodactyls and shit.

1298
01:52:51.723 --> 01:52:53.517
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1299
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.269
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1300
01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:58.438
It looks like all the systems
run through to the control room,

1301
01:52:58.522 --> 01:52:59.773
which is on the third floor.

1302
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:03.402
These outposts
are all connected underground.

1303
01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:10.742
All right. Easy, Rambo.

1304
01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:22.838
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1305
01:53:23.755 --> 01:53:25.299
Yeah.

1306
01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:26.466
Wow. And what happens?

1307
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:29.803
Do you just tell them what to do
and they comply? Or...

1308
01:53:31.013 --> 01:53:34.725
Well, it's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1309
01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:36.268
Mm-hmm.

1310
01:53:37.352 --> 01:53:39.479
I had a dog once.

1311
01:53:39.563 --> 01:53:44.234
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1312
01:53:44.318 --> 01:53:45.569
That's a true story.

1313
01:53:58.957 --> 01:54:01.335
Oh, god. Hey. Good.

1314
01:54:03.587 --> 01:54:06.298
Here's what I'm thinking.
We get started again.

1315
01:54:06.381 --> 01:54:08.383
You and me. I can get money.

1316
01:54:09.968 --> 01:54:12.346
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1317
01:54:12.429 --> 01:54:15.474
Wh-what's the matter?
Don't look so worried. There's...

1318
01:54:15.557 --> 01:54:19.770
There's opportunity in everything.
E-Even this. You'll learn that.

1319
01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.358
I've been thinking,
maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?

1320
01:54:25.233 --> 01:54:26.318
You're ready, I think.

1321
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:27.861
Here, take...

1322
01:54:28.487 --> 01:54:30.155
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1323
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:40.791
It was you.

1324
01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:44.127
You told Malcolm
about the program. Y-You...

1325
01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:47.881
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up.

1326
01:54:48.799 --> 01:54:51.176
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1327
01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:57.265
We have an understanding, Ramsay.
And you do not break that.

1328
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.686
I would not break this.

1329
01:55:05.023 --> 01:55:06.358
I'm not you.

1330
01:55:19.121 --> 01:55:20.497
Uh-oh.

1331
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.166
This is very bad.

1332
01:55:25.001 --> 01:55:27.003
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1333
01:55:27.087 --> 01:55:31.883
Great. So we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1334
01:55:31.967 --> 01:55:33.760
Let's see. Ads...

1335
01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:36.888
What's this? What's "error 99"?

1336
01:55:36.972 --> 01:55:38.890
Not enough power.

1337
01:55:38.974 --> 01:55:40.767
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1338
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:43.019
by the primary system to keep running.

1339
01:55:43.103 --> 01:55:45.272
We need all that power
to reactivate the ads.

1340
01:55:45.355 --> 01:55:47.399
The system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1341
01:55:47.482 --> 01:55:48.775
Of course.

1342
01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:50.694
- How do we get more power?
- We can't.

1343
01:55:50.777 --> 01:55:52.612
But we can redistribute what we have.

1344
01:55:52.696 --> 01:55:54.616
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1345
01:55:54.698 --> 01:55:55.907
- Yes. Exactly.
- Where is it?

1346
01:55:55.991 --> 01:55:58.118
- Uh, next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1347
01:55:58.201 --> 01:55:59.619
We escaped down here.

1348
01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:04.458
- Where is that? Water treatment center?
- Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.

1349
01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:06.168
Give me eight minutes.
I could find her.

1350
01:56:06.251 --> 01:56:07.335
Wait. Who's this now?

1351
01:56:07.419 --> 01:56:09.421
Beta. Blue's baby.

1352
01:56:09.504 --> 01:56:11.006
Velociraptor.

1353
01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:12.674
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1354
01:56:12.757 --> 01:56:14.468
You gave her a name.
How about that?

1355
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:16.344
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1356
01:56:16.428 --> 01:56:19.306
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1357
01:56:19.389 --> 01:56:21.016
You're coming with us, right?

1358
01:56:21.099 --> 01:56:22.684
Maisie, I...

1359
01:56:22.767 --> 01:56:23.810
Please.

1360
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.065
- I'll be on channel five.
- Okay.

1361
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:31.151
We're on three.

1362
01:56:31.776 --> 01:56:32.777
Come back.

1363
01:56:33.695 --> 01:56:35.030
I always come back.

1364
01:56:36.156 --> 01:56:38.950
I'll have that chopper hot in ten.
Wait for my signal.

1365
01:56:41.077 --> 01:56:43.413
<i>Evacuation phase four complete.</i>

1366
01:56:43.497 --> 01:56:45.499
<i>All living assets now in containment.</i>

1367
01:56:54.508 --> 01:56:55.509
Come on.

1368
01:57:08.063 --> 01:57:09.523
Still get nightmares?

1369
01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:11.107
All the time.

1370
01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:13.151
You?

1371
01:57:14.528 --> 01:57:16.446
I have a lot of regrets.

1372
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:17.531
Oh, yeah?

1373
01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:20.033
Well,

1374
01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:24.079
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1375
01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:29.334
What matters, I guess, is...

1376
01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:32.504
Is what we do now.

1377
01:57:33.129 --> 01:57:34.965
- Right?
- Yeah.

1378
01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:43.974
Ah.

1379
01:57:47.769 --> 01:57:49.062
Okay.

1380
01:57:52.399 --> 01:57:54.359
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1381
01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:58.572
B4. She's in here.

1382
01:57:59.447 --> 01:58:03.118
Watch the sides.
They always come from the sides.

1383
01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:11.084
You know, at first we thought
they disembowel their prey, but no.

1384
01:58:12.294 --> 01:58:14.713
They're smart enough
to go straight for the throat.

1385
01:58:15.797 --> 01:58:17.257
The veins, the arteries.

1386
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:20.677
Sometimes both at the same time.

1387
01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.886
Okay.

1388
01:58:23.638 --> 01:58:24.889
Okay.

1389
01:58:24.973 --> 01:58:26.891
<i>We've got you.
It's right down that aisle.</i>

1390
01:58:26.975 --> 01:58:29.775
<i>It's right down that aisle where you are.</i>

1391
01:58:29.811 --> 01:58:31.146
<i>Why are they skulking in...</i>

1392
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:32.397
You can sprint right for it.

1393
01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.899
Okay. Here it is.

1394
01:58:34.983 --> 01:58:37.068
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on a grid of six.

1395
01:58:37.152 --> 01:58:39.946
<i>There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?</i>

1396
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:41.781
<i>It's not that green button.</i>

1397
01:58:41.865 --> 01:58:43.908
It's four from the bottom.
Above this...

1398
01:58:43.992 --> 01:58:45.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

1399
01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:47.213
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1400
01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:48.538
Ian, be specific.

1401
01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:55.045
She was here.

1402
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:56.796
Lights off.

1403
01:59:03.345 --> 01:59:05.430
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1404
01:59:05.513 --> 01:59:08.266
other than to say
that the one you want is marked

1405
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:10.018
- with "E1." E1.
- E1.

1406
01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:15.482
Yeah.

1407
01:59:20.028 --> 01:59:22.197
No. No, no, no, no.

1408
01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.789
Damn it. She's fast.

1409
01:59:35.543 --> 01:59:36.961
Eyes on me.

1410
01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:43.760
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1411
01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.470
Maisie,
you're gonna hold her focus.

1412
01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:47.097
Grant,

1413
01:59:47.764 --> 01:59:48.890
we're triangulating.

1414
02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:26.261
Sorry, girl.

1415
02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:29.347
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1416
02:00:30.682 --> 02:00:32.684
<i>Primary system rebooting.</i>

1417
02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:34.853
Wait. Oh, no, no, no.

1418
02:00:34.936 --> 02:00:36.271
- No, no, no.
- It's rebooting.

1419
02:00:36.354 --> 02:00:37.480
It shouldn't be doing that.

1420
02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:50.368
Here, take this.

1421
02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:08.404
- Gonna stay on it.
<i>- Shut it down!</i>

1422
02:01:08.428 --> 02:01:10.740
We're gonna make it work.
We're gonna figure this out. It's complex.

1423
02:01:10.764 --> 02:01:12.724
We don't have time for complex!

1424
02:01:18.021 --> 02:01:19.898
<i>Primary system compromised.</i>

1425
02:01:22.233 --> 02:01:23.651
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1426
02:01:23.735 --> 02:01:25.629
<i>Aerial deterrent system active.</i>

1427
02:01:25.653 --> 02:01:26.738
Victory. Victory.

1428
02:01:30.617 --> 02:01:32.076
Damn, that felt good.

1429
02:02:00.563 --> 02:02:02.065
Oh! Come on!

1430
02:02:54.826 --> 02:02:56.035
What's your story?

1431
02:02:59.581 --> 02:03:00.582
Wait!

1432
02:03:11.551 --> 02:03:14.012
At Biosyn, we 're dedicated to the idea

1433
02:03:14.095 --> 02:03:18.057
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

1434
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:25.064
All right, Kayla. We 're good to go.

1435
02:03:35.617 --> 02:03:36.743
Okay, cutie.

1436
02:03:43.541 --> 02:03:44.542
Come here.

1437
02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:47.002
You all right?

1438
02:03:48.129 --> 02:03:49.297
Hey.

1439
02:03:57.347 --> 02:03:58.556
I remember you.

1440
02:03:59.182 --> 02:04:00.767
Please. You have to listen to me.

1441
02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:02.727
You created an ecological disaster.

1442
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:04.228
And I can fix it.

1443
02:04:04.938 --> 02:04:08.149
Charlotte lock wood changed every cell
in Maisie's body.

1444
02:04:09.233 --> 02:04:10.735
It saved her life.

1445
02:04:10.818 --> 02:04:14.280
If I can understand
how Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1446
02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:17.533
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm.

1447
02:04:17.617 --> 02:04:19.452
Before it's too late.

1448
02:04:21.454 --> 02:04:22.455
It's okay.

1449
02:04:23.247 --> 02:04:24.248
It's okay.

1450
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:29.504
It's what she would've wanted.

1451
02:04:32.507 --> 02:04:33.508
Thank you.

1452
02:04:33.591 --> 02:04:34.592
No, no, no.

1453
02:04:35.677 --> 02:04:37.470
No, no, no, no, no.

1454
02:04:38.346 --> 02:04:39.347
Him?

1455
02:04:39.847 --> 02:04:42.350
Not him. Not him.
It's always him.

1456
02:04:42.433 --> 02:04:43.434
Every si...

1457
02:04:45.019 --> 02:04:46.771
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1458
02:04:47.772 --> 02:04:48.940
Yeah. Why?

1459
02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:52.694
I have air. Meet me at the center.

1460
02:04:52.777 --> 02:04:56.406
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey. Do not land in here.

1461
02:04:56.489 --> 02:04:58.533
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1462
02:04:58.616 --> 02:05:00.201
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1463
02:05:00.284 --> 02:05:02.370
Oh!

1464
02:06:32.627 --> 02:06:33.711
This isn't about us.

1465
02:06:38.716 --> 02:06:39.717
Go! Go!

1466
02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.364
Come on!

1467
02:07:05.159 --> 02:07:07.787
Oh, my god! Get him up!
Come on, come on!

1468
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:09.872
Come on.

1469
02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:13.459
Come on, come on, come on.

1470
02:07:18.047 --> 02:07:19.048
Come on!

1471
02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:34.563
Ellie, no!

1472
02:08:04.051 --> 02:08:05.469
Come on, Maisie! Go!

1473
02:08:07.555 --> 02:08:08.848
Ramsay, get in.

1474
02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:10.683
Come on, come on, come on.

1475
02:08:15.188 --> 02:08:17.106
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1476
02:09:41.565 --> 02:09:43.234
No, at every level.

1477
02:09:43.317 --> 02:09:45.903
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1478
02:09:45.987 --> 02:09:48.990
"Systemic corruption." You get that?
Write that down.

1479
02:09:49.073 --> 02:09:51.367
Yeah, it's crazy.

1480
02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.704
And then... and then we crashed
into this ice lake, right?

1481
02:09:54.787 --> 02:09:56.789
I mean,
they literally owe me a plane.

1482
02:09:56.872 --> 02:09:59.667
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1483
02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:01.877
before I take it to my contact
at <i>The Times.</i>

1484
02:10:04.213 --> 02:10:06.424
You could, uh, come with me.

1485
02:10:08.092 --> 02:10:10.511
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1486
02:10:13.514 --> 02:10:15.016
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

1487
02:10:17.685 --> 02:10:19.395
I am coming with you.

1488
02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:33.909
I know. One more minute,
then we'll send you home with your folks.

1489
02:11:13.574 --> 02:11:15.659
<i>Today marks the first day of testimony</i>

1490
02:11:15.743 --> 02:11:17.995
<i>from Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay Cole.</i>

1491
02:11:18.079 --> 02:11:21.957
<i>The senate will also hear from

1492
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:25.711
<i>who have been vocal in this debate
since the incident at Jurassic park.</i>

1493
02:11:28.339 --> 02:11:29.548
You look...

1494
02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:31.634
- Uncomfortable.
- Trustworthy.

1495
02:11:36.931 --> 02:11:39.141
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1496
02:11:41.602 --> 02:11:42.603
Let's finish this.

1497
02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:44.563
Yeah.

1498
02:11:48.776 --> 02:11:51.529
<i>Dr. Henry Wu
has found an emergency solution</i>

1499
02:11:51.612 --> 02:11:53.572
<i>to the ecological crisis.</i>

1500
02:11:53.656 --> 02:11:56.826
<i>His use of a pathogen

1501

<i>has revolutionized modern genetics.</i>

<i>The animals will live there free,
safe from the outside world</i>

1506
02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:49.420
- money?
- Money.

1507
02:12:49.503 --> 02:12:50.504
Thank you.

1508
02:14:54.253 --> 02:14:58.090
Life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.

1509
02:14:59.174 --> 02:15:01.885
And dinosaurs were only a part of that.

1510
02:15:01.969 --> 02:15:03.929
And we're an even smaller part of that.

1511
02:15:04.638 --> 02:15:06.807
They really put us in perspective.

1512
02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:12.313
<i>The idea that life on earth
existed 65 million years ago...</i>

1513
02:15:13.981 --> 02:15:14.982
It's humbling.

1514
02:15:16.609 --> 02:15:19.028
We act like we're alone here,
but we're not.

1515
02:15:19.903 --> 02:15:22.823
<i>We 're part of a fragile system
made up of all living things.</i>

1516
02:15:24.116 --> 02:15:26.910
<i>If we 're going to survive,
we '/I have to trust each other.</i>

1517
02:15:28.037 --> 02:15:29.330
<i>Depend on each other.</i>

1518
02:15:30.289 --> 02:15:32.041
Coexist.
