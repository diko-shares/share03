00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.616
Ah, this kid.
Did you talk to her?

177
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.368
I tried.

178
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.330

- I'll talk to her.

- [Claire] Whoo!

- Stone-cold.
- Right?

194
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.069
- I would not mess with her.
- [Chuckles] No way.

[Sighs]

196
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.912
Listen. We should probably
talk about you going into town.

197
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.163
I don't...

198
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.686
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

199
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:42.877
You're not trapped here.
We just don't trust people.

200
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.378
No, you just don't trust me.

201
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.923
And then you expect me to trust you.

202
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.342
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

203

What is happening?

205
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.229
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

206
00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.730
You remember what that was like.

207
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.982
[Claire] I do.

208
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.861
We can't keep her here forever.

209
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.448
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge.

210
00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.492
If they find her,
we're never gonna see her again.

211

We gotta protect her. That's our job.
That's what we're gonna do.

Protect her how?

213
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.289

Wasn't sure who to call.

Fish and wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

238

Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

239
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.757
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

240
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.841

241
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.718
These your students?

242
00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:42.014
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

243
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.558
So, this is right up our alley.

244
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.602
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

245
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.313
You seen anything like
this before?

246
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.565
No. Not like this.

247
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.652
They've been leaving degraded fields
all across the mid west.

248
00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:59.407
First these big companies try to kill off
all the insects, now this.

249
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.377
Is that your land?

250
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.296
[Farmer] That's the bennetts' corn.
The locusts didn't eat that.

251
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.716
You plant the same seed
as the bennetts?

252
00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:19.927
We're independent.

253
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.472
They use biosyn seed.

254
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.476
Yeah, I bet they do.

255
00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.646

- Yeah?

258
00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.032
[Student 2] Okay. Let her down slow.

259

- [Student 3] Got it?
- [Student 2] Yeah.

260
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.121

Just about there. I'm on it.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.087
[Alan] Why do we dig?

264
00:20:55.171 --> 00:21:00.968
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

265
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.970
And there is truth in these rocks.

266

You look the same.

273
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.458
And this place, it's so...

274
00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.628
So, uh... you.

275
00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:40.549
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming, I would've...

[Clanking]

277
00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.141
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

278
00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:54.271
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 am,
but iced tea or...

279
00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:55.773
Tea. Yeah.

280
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.024
Tea. I can do that.

281
00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.694
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

282
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:06.200
Well, the funding's dried up,
so somebody's gotta pay for all this.

283
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:07.701
Right. Thank you.

284
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.083
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming.

285
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.376
That's great.

286
00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:16.460
Thanks.

287
00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:18.587
Gave me grounds
for some hope for a change.

288
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:20.089
How are your kids?

289
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.215
Mmm.

290
00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.969
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.

291
00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:27.429
They're both in college.
Can you believe that?

292
00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:28.806
And Mark?

293
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:31.892
It's over.

294
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.731
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

295
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:39.233
It's okay.

296
00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.068
I'm back to me.

297
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.195
And my work. You know, it's...

298
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.280
That's great.

299
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:47.449
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.

300
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.034
Exciting times.

301
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:51.620
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

302
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.330
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

303
00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:54.832
So freeing.

304
00:22:57.751 --> 00:22:58.794
Ellie.

305
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:04.800
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

306
00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.804
[Chittering]

307
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.222
Well, that's a locust.

308
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:13.017
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

309
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:15.811
God, the size of it is massive.

310
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.858
It has genes that have been extinct
since the cretaceous.

311
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:24.320
And swarms of them are decimating crops
from Iowa to Texas.

312
00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.322
Terrifying, right?

313
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:28.908
Started as a few hundred.

314
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.076
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

315
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.623
If they keep going, there'll be
no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

316
00:23:35.706 --> 00:23:37.875
The entire food chain
would collapse.

317
00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:42.046
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

318
00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:47.051
None of the crops they're eating
are biosyn seed.

319
00:23:47.134 --> 00:23:48.385
Biosyn.

320
00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:50.888
You're saying biosyn made this?

321
00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:54.767
I mean, it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world's food supply.

322
00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:57.311
Not before a few million starve.

323
00:23:57.394 --> 00:24:01.690
Yeah, what is that saying?
How we're three meals away from anarchy?

324
00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:05.152
If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three meals.

325
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:08.948
So, why are you bringing it to me?

326
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:12.868
I need concrete evidence
Biosyn's responsible for all this.

327
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:16.872
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

328
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:20.042
But I need a witness.

329
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:22.294
Alan.

330
00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:25.673
You command respect.
People believe you.

331
00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:27.716
[Chuckles] Ellie.

332
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.053
You know why I'm here.
It's quiet. I'm done with all that.

333
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.346
Are you? Okay.

334
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.974
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

335
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:38.686
Nobody gets that luxury anymore,
not even you.

336
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:39.770
And you know what?

337
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.314
You're the one I trust.

338
00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:44.400
[Chittering]

339
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:50.572
This biosyn sanctuary is, what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

340
00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:51.991
How do you even get in there?

341
00:24:52.074 --> 00:24:55.828
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

342
00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:00.082
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

343
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:03.585
And he just happened
to invite you out of the blue?

344
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.213
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

345
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.339
Uh-huh.

346
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.763
You coming or what?

347
00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.398
[Guard] It's clear!

348
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.485
[Guard 2] Keep it going. That's good.

349
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:29.570

before shipping out
to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.

352
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:38.037
We give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy.

353
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.247
So much security.

354
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.082
Those are just the ones you see.

355
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.376
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:52.384
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

359
00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:54.219
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

360
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:57.765
Hello.

Staying out of trouble?

386
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.238
She had a baby. That's impossible.

387

- Back up.
- [Maisie] She won't hurt us, right?

388

You're damn right she will.

389

390
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:47.624
- If you don't, she'll think you're scared.
- I am scared.

391

Nah.
She doesn't need to know that.

392
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.763

Maisie, get inside.

- What did I just say?

They're eating the corn, wheat.

Franklin. It's me. You at work?

445
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:37.604
Okay, you're kind of
a subject of interest around here,

446
00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.398
so I can't really be talking to you.

447
00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:42.109
Come on. I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.

448
00:31:42.192 --> 00:31:43.443
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

449
00:31:43.527 --> 00:31:45.529
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

450
00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:46.738
We 're outside.

451
00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:50.033
[Owen] Let me talk to him.

452
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.123
- That him?
- That's him.

453
00:31:56.206 --> 00:32:00.293
Name's Rainn Delacourt.
Real piece of work.

454
00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:01.378
What'd he take?

455
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:04.673
Something we care about
very much.

456
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:08.343
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

457
00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:10.262
You can't just take a person, Claire.

458
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.305
- We had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

459
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:15.225
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

460
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:17.894
Where'd you call me from?

461
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.858
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

462
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.569
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.

463
00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:27.070
Was she with him?

464
00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:31.199
There's no mention,
but we have people on the ground already.

465
00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:32.659
One of them you know.

466
00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:35.287
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the park went down.

467
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:38.582
Barry's French intelligence now.

468
00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:41.877
I need to talk to him.

469
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.045
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

470
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.881
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

471
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.175
our guys will see
if Delacourt knows where she is.

472
00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:51.344
Our guys. Not you.

473
00:32:51.428 --> 00:32:55.932
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

474
00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:58.226
Why would I do that?

475
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:01.730
Look, you guys are both crazy,

476
00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:06.276
but you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

477
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.320
She's lucky to have you.

478
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.656
Don't get killed, okay?

479
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:27.589
[Clears throat]

480
00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:31.343
I think we're almost there.

481
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.345
Yeah.

482
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.985
Dr. Sattler. Dr. Grant.

483
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:51.363
- Ramsay Cole, communications.
- Oh, hey.

484
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:53.698
I have to warn you,
everyone's so excited to have you.

485
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.326
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

486
00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:59.162
Mmm. You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

487
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:02.207
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.

488
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.126
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

489
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.379
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

490
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.881
I mean, such motility of thought.
It's incredible.

491
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.758
How much time
have you spent with him?

492
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:12.926
[Laughs]

493
00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:16.012
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

494
00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:18.306
Oh, please. After you.
And watch your head.

495
00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:28.501
[Ramsay] Biosyn bought this land
for the Amber deposits back in the '905.

496
00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:30.569
But we've managed
to turn it into a safe haven

497
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:32.070
for about 20 displaced species.

498
00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:36.074
First generation came from Sorna.
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs are here too.

499
00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.994
Took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the T. Rex.

500
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.580
- The...
- The T. Rex is here?

501
00:34:41.663 --> 00:34:43.456
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

502
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:46.960
[Arrived just before you guys.

503
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:06.187
[Automated voice]
Aerial deterrent system, active.

504
00:35:06.688 --> 00:35:09.566
Restricted air space.
Protects the airborne life.

505
00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.985
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.

506
00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:13.069
Airborne?

507
00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:17.240
Is that <i>Dreadnoughtus?</i>

508
00:35:17.324 --> 00:35:18.742
[Gasps] What?

509
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.751
[Ramsay] Beautiful, right?

510
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:32.213
The name means "fear nothing."
Well, I guess you know that. [Laughs]

511
00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.716
- What do they graze on?
- [Ramsay] Hawthorn and fern.

512
00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:38.136
All indigenous. Nothing stocked
except for the deer population.

513
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:41.056
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

514
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:43.433
The apex predator?

515
00:35:43.516 --> 00:35:45.060
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

516
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:47.228
At least for now.

517
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:57.322
[Growls, huffs]

518
00:35:57.405 --> 00:36:00.075
You don't let people in there, right?

519
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.869
Uh, no. Our... our research... [chuckles]

520
00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:05.830
Our research outposts are connected
completely underground.

521
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:08.958
If we have to,
we can just herd the animals remotely

522
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:13.296
using a neuro-implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

523
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.798
Like shocks?

524
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.384
Uh... n-no, like signals.

525
00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:20.345
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit...

526
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.805
- Cruel?
- Cruel.

527
00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:26.017
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic park?

528
00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:27.977
Yeah.

529
00:36:34.067 --> 00:36:36.903
[Pa announcer] Please join Dr. LAN Malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall

530
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:38.780
for the ethics of genetic power.

531
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.949
God, everyone's so young.

532
00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:44.369
Well, it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest.

533
00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:45.954
Doctors.

534
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:51.126
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler.
Dr. Grant. Hi.

535
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.336
Wow, this is big. I'm Lewis.

536
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.380
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

537
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:57.233
- You're Lewis Dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

538
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:59.175
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

539
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:01.469
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

540
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.304
- Would you?
- [Chuckles] No.

541
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:06.516
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

542
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.017
Would you mind if we, um...

543
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.937
- Just to... it would mean a lot.
- Oh.

544
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.106
- [Ellie] Do you wanna, um...
- [Shutter clicking]

545
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:15.024
- Oh, great. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

546
00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:17.527
- That's good. That's good. Thanks.
- [Photographer] Okay.

547
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.906
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

548
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.702
We are unlocking the true power
of the genome.

549
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:27.120
We're this close. Believe me.

550
00:37:27.203 --> 00:37:28.955
You'll make a fortune with that.

551
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:31.166
No, it's not about money.

552
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.544
No, we've already identified dozens
of applications for paleo-DNA.

553
00:37:34.627 --> 00:37:38.173
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

554
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.799
We will be saving lives.

555
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.760
- But... shh. [Chuckles]
- I bet.

556
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:45.930
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself, but, uh, it's...

557
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:49.184
So, you're in more-than-capable hands
with Ramsay.

558
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.395
He's basically a young me.

559
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:57.108
- Only smarter and, uh, taller.
- [Laughs]

560
00:37:57.192 --> 00:37:58.401
Do you have food?

561
00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:01.488
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon? Um...

562
00:38:01.571 --> 00:38:03.573
No, never mind.
I-I'll find something.

563
00:38:03.656 --> 00:38:07.952
So, I want to do more of this
later on, if we, um...

564
00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:10.246
Oh! We booked you
a private pod...

565
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.831
- Right.
- For the trip out, so...

566
00:38:11.915 --> 00:38:14.667
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

567
00:38:14.751 --> 00:38:16.419
You better hurry. Malcolm's on.

568
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.338
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

569
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.381
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.

570
00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.675
Thank you for being here. It's...

571
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:27.639
Okay. Um, follow me, please.

572
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:30.850
What?

573
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.648
Human beings have no more right
to safety or Liberty

574
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.651
than any other creature
on this planet.

575
00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:45.615
We not only lack dominion over nature,

576
00:38:46.574 --> 00:38:48.159
we're subordinate to it.

577
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.829
And now, here we are

578
00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:54.082
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips.

579
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.209
And just like nuclear power,

580
00:38:56.292 --> 00:38:59.087
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

581
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.007
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best,

582
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.970
just like you are doing now.

583
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.098
Yep. You.

584
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:16.980
You control the future
of our survival on planet earth.

585
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:19.732
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

586
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:23.194
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

587
00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:27.907
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

588
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:31.786
Unforeseen consequences occur.

589
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:37.333
And every time, every single time...

590
00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:40.795
We all act surprised?

591
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:42.505
Because deep down,

592
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:46.885
I don't think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real.

593
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.428
[Door opens]

594
00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.061
[Ian] In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

595
00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:04.027
we must transform human consciousness.

596
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.195
[Attendees applauding]

597
00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:08.281
Whoo!

598
00:40:09.282 --> 00:40:10.617
[Attendee] Yeah!

599
00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:13.161
- May am?
- Dr. Malcolm?

600
00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:16.080
- [Fans chattering]
- Very good. There you go.

601
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:17.933
I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

602
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:20.126
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

603
00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.086
Look at you,

604
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.965
and look at me, and look at you.

605
00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.717
Wha... this is so trippy.

606
00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:29.969
You look like you're doing well.

607
00:40:30.053 --> 00:40:33.598
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

608
00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:34.933
Expenses add up.

609
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:39.062
You? Alan, are you...
You have any family or...

610
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:42.523
- No.
- So, I need to talk to you.

611
00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:45.568
Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
Privately.

612
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:47.236
Do you two talk a lot?

613
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.489
- He slid into my DMs.
- He did what?

614
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:51.407
- It's urgent, Ian.
- What did you do?

615
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:53.242
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

616
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:55.745
The doomsday clock might be
about out of time,

617
00:40:55.828 --> 00:41:00.625
but, as they say, it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

618
00:41:01.668 --> 00:41:02.669
What?

619
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:08.132
[Ellie]
Locusts altered with cretaceous-era DNA.

620
00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.177
- [Ian] That's not my field.
- But if these things continue to multiply,

621
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.430
we're talking about
cascading system-wide effects, LAN.

622
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:15.974
Gosh, that's a drag.

623
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:18.226
- What is the matter with you?
- "Drag"?

624
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.349
Why, is there something special
you wanted me to do?

625
00:41:20.395 --> 00:41:22.772
- How about give a damn?
- You know too much not to care.

626
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:26.025
Hey, I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

627
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:29.821
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation,

628
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:34.075
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and, uh...

629
00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.703
You know,
just like we always do, squander it.

630
00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:39.872
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

631
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:42.667
Can I offer you guys some Joe?

632
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.129
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

633
00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:47.547
I don't want a cappuccino.

634
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.465
I could do, like, a cortado
or macchiato...

635
00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:52.510
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag.
This is gonna perk you right up.

636
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:54.470
[Coffee machine whirring]

637
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.390
[Whirring continues]

638
00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:00.435
The locusts are part of a larger project
called Hexapod allies.

639
00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:02.186
- I...
- You're right about their intent.

640
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.188
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

641
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:06.774
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

642
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:10.028
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to. It's crescendoing.

643
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:11.404
They're proliferating wildly.

644
00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:13.990
They're lasting three,
four times longer than they should.

645
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:17.660
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

646
00:42:17.744 --> 00:42:19.412
Downstairs, Sublevel six.

647
00:42:19.495 --> 00:42:21.456
That's where they keep
the locusts.

648
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.875
- Look for a lab marked L4.
- [Alan, Tyler chattering]

649
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:25.793
But wait, how are we
gonna get down there?

650
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:28.546
This looks so silky.
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

651
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.630
Sure.

652
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:31.632
You know what it is?
Don't tell me. This is...

653
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.218
- You won't know it.
- Sustainable bamboo.

654
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:36.554
- It is sustainable bamboo.
- That's why I said...

655
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:37.930
- How'd you know?
- I just know.

656
00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:39.348
- It's amazing.
- Very amazing.

657
00:42:39.432 --> 00:42:40.433
I've got cumin, cinnamon.

658
00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:42.310
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

659
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.713
- I've got five-spice...
- Doctor.

660
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.438
If you're into that kind of feel.

661
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:47.940
- [Tyler] Um, and let's talk milks.
- Yeah.

662
00:42:48.024 --> 00:42:50.026
Okay, soy milk, yes?

663
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:51.527
{gasps}

664
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:53.196
- [Tyler] No.
- What just happened?

665
00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:55.615
We're in.

666
00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:00.912
[Chattering]

667
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:11.839
[Automated voice]
Sublevel Six. Restricted.

668
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:20.723
[Henry]
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

669
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:24.727
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

670
00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:27.605
They're multiplying like crazy
and they're not dying.

671
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:30.191
- What part of this don't you understand?
- I do understand.

672
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.026
This is gonna be a global famine.

673
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.487
Hey, hey,
we can't anticipate everything.

674
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.447
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

675
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.407
- What?
- All of them.

676
00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:39.742
- No.no.
- Like...

677
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:42.120
- Henry, we don't want to cause a panic.
- Like yesterday.

678
00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:43.871
We want control.

679
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:45.998
There's no such thing.

680
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:53.422
[Sighs]

681
00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.804
When we're afraid,

682
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:01.973
what do we do?

683
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.641
What have we done before?

684
00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.685
We follow through.

685
00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:08.396
That's what we do.

686
00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.480
Right?

687
00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.317
Right.

688
00:44:16.445 --> 00:44:18.156
We found the girl.

689
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:19.615
She's en route.

690
00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:21.868
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

691
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:24.453
- Wait, you found her?
- Yeah, found them both.

692
00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:25.830

You don't look like you fly for biosyn.

941
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:44.529
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

You wanna ask questions,
or you want a ride?

947
01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.676
We'll take the ride.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.080

we don't do that here.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.226
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.

- [Ramsay] Great.

967

Elevators are down this hall,
not those.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.362
Those lead you
down to the Sublevels.

970
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.590
You need special clearance
to get down there.

971
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.074
- Oh, okay.
- Thirty minutes.

Yeah.

985
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.830
We needed her
to help us understand you.

986
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.795
[Maisie] Hey, beta.

987
01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.631
You okay?

988
01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:11.509
Did you say "beta"? Is that her name?

989
01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.386
I gave it to her.

990
01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.430
Beta is pretty special.

991
01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.307
You know, when we made blue,

992
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.560
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

993
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.522
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

994
01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:28.526
So beta and blue
are genetically identical,

995
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.504
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

996
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.197
Charlotte.

997
01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:36.534
What do you know about Charlotte?

998
01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.161
She died.

999

1001
01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:46.753
So he made me.

1002
01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.507
No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't.

1003
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.094

Center of that.</i>

[Henry] Charlotte lived on site B
with all of us till the storm.

- [Henry] <i>Charlotte, be careful.
- Yeah, I will.</i>

1010
01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.915
[Henry] She grew up around scientists.

1011
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.251
And eventually...

1012
01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:29.712
She became one herself.

1013

into my office this morning.</i>

1014

1015
01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:37.470

<i>For all my work with creatures,

1017
01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.933

<i>In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?</i>

<i>And if it's possible, what makes it so?</i>

1020
01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.030
<i>I've lost my pen.</i>

1021
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.077
Is that me?

1022
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.580
Yeah. [Chuckles]

1023
01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:07.292
Just like blue, Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

1024
01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.879
She created you with her own DNA.

1025
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.216
So I do have a mother.

1026
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.469
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

1027
01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.097
He was protecting her, and you.

1028
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:23.766
And we're the same?

1029
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.978
You were.

1030
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:31.232
When you were a baby, Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

1031
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.985
That's how she died.

1032
01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:36.696
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

1033
01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:39.407
- Do I have it too?
- No.

1034
01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.161
She changed your DNA.

1035
01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.790
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

1036
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.044
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

1037
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:53.421
She fixed me.

1038
01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.007
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

1039
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.803
Your DNA could change the world.

1040
01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:05.892
And I have to know how she did it,
but I just can't replicate her work.

1041
01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:10.813
If I could just study you and beta,
whose DNA was never changed, I could...

1042
01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:16.361
Fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

1043
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.237

Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

1227
01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:27.271
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1228
01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:30.232
but it didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home.

1229
01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:33.068
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

with this line of work.

I could have said something, but I didn't.

will you?

after Hammond died,

1281
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:46.905
she came to my university to lecture,

1282

- You need to leave.
- [Ian] Yeah, I do.

1322

But first,
I owe all these folks an apology.

1323
01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:29.109
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint,

1324
01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.987
I might've made it seem
as if biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

in a short period of time

1328

that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

01:52:13.727 --> 01:52:17.439
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.
Yeah, I know who you are.

1566
01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:20.192
You trained raptors.

1567
01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:23.278
[Chuckles] I tried. Yeah.

1568
01:52:23.362 --> 01:52:25.447
- How you doing?
- The one here.

1569
01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:28.367
You were at Jurassic world.

1570
01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:32.663
Jurassic world? Not a fan.
Mm-mmm.

1571
01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:36.583
Okay.
So, we good to find a way out of here?

1572
01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:38.961
- Yep.
- [Kayla] Let's get it.

1573
01:52:39.044 --> 01:52:42.297
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1574
01:52:42.381 --> 01:52:45.050
We turn the ads back on, we go home.

1575
01:52:45.133 --> 01:52:47.594
- [Ellie] Wait. What's an ads?
- Aerial deterrent system.

1576
01:52:49.221 --> 01:52:51.640
You know?
For the pterodactyls and shit.

1577
01:52:51.723 --> 01:52:53.517
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1578
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.269
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1579
01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:58.438
It looks like all the systems
run through to the control room,

1580
01:52:58.522 --> 01:52:59.773
which is on the third floor.

1581
01:53:01.191 --> 01:53:03.402
These outposts
are all connected underground.

1582
01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:10.742
All right. Easy, Rambo.

1583
01:53:10.826 --> 01:53:12.536
[Grunts, sighs]

1584
01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:22.838
[Ian] So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1585
01:53:23.755 --> 01:53:25.299
Yeah.

1586
01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:26.466
Wow. And what happens?

1587
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:29.803
Do you just tell them what to do
and they comply? Or...

1588
01:53:31.013 --> 01:53:34.725
Well, it's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1589
01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:36.268
Mm-hmm.

1590
01:53:37.352 --> 01:53:39.479
I had a dog once.

1591
01:53:39.563 --> 01:53:44.234
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1592
01:53:44.318 --> 01:53:45.569
That's a true story.

1593
01:53:58.957 --> 01:54:01.335
Oh, god. Hey. Good.

1594
01:54:03.587 --> 01:54:06.298
Here's what I'm thinking.
We get started again.

1595
01:54:06.381 --> 01:54:08.383
You and me. I can get money.

1596
01:54:09.968 --> 01:54:12.346
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1597
01:54:12.429 --> 01:54:15.474
Wh-what's the matter?
Don't look so worried. There's...

1598
01:54:15.557 --> 01:54:19.770
There's opportunity in everything.
E-Even this. You'll learn that.

1599
01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.358
I've been thinking,
maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?

1600
01:54:25.233 --> 01:54:26.318
You're ready, I think.

1601
01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:27.861
Here, take...

1602
01:54:28.487 --> 01:54:30.155
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1603
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:40.791
It was you.

1604
01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:44.127
You told Malcolm
about the program. Y-You...

1605
01:54:45.128 --> 01:54:47.881
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up.

1606
01:54:48.799 --> 01:54:51.176
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1607
01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:57.265
We have an understanding, Ramsay.
And you do not break that.

1608
01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.686
I would not break this.

1609
01:55:05.023 --> 01:55:06.358
I'm not you.

1610
01:55:13.532 --> 01:55:16.118
[Alarm beeping]

1611
01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:19.037
- [Ian sighs]
- [Claire gasps]

1612
01:55:19.121 --> 01:55:20.497
[Ian] Uh-oh.

1613
01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:23.166
This is very bad.

1614
01:55:25.001 --> 01:55:27.003
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1615
01:55:27.087 --> 01:55:31.883
Great. So we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1616
01:55:31.967 --> 01:55:33.760
Let's see. Ads...

1617
01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:36.888
What's this? What's "error 99"?

1618
01:55:36.972 --> 01:55:38.890
[Ramsay] Not enough power.

1619
01:55:38.974 --> 01:55:40.767
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1620
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:43.019
by the primary system to keep running.

1621
01:55:43.103 --> 01:55:45.272
We need all that power
to reactivate the ads.

1622
01:55:45.355 --> 01:55:47.399
The system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1623
01:55:47.482 --> 01:55:48.775
[Scoffs] Of course.

1624
01:55:48.859 --> 01:55:50.694
- How do we get more power?
- We can't.

1625
01:55:50.777 --> 01:55:52.612
But we can redistribute what we have.

1626
01:55:52.696 --> 01:55:54.616
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1627
01:55:54.698 --> 01:55:55.907
- Yes. Exactly.
- Where is it?

1628
01:55:55.991 --> 01:55:58.118
- Uh, next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1629
01:55:58.201 --> 01:55:59.619
We escaped down here.

1630
01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:04.458
- Where is that? Water treatment center?
- Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.

1631
01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:06.168
Give me eight minutes.
I could find her.

1632
01:56:06.251 --> 01:56:07.335
Wait. Who's this now?

1633
01:56:07.419 --> 01:56:09.421
Beta. Blue's baby.

1634
01:56:09.504 --> 01:56:11.006
Velociraptor.

1635
01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:12.674
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1636
01:56:12.757 --> 01:56:14.468
You gave her a name.
How about that?

1637
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:16.344
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1638
01:56:16.428 --> 01:56:19.306
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1639
01:56:19.389 --> 01:56:21.016
You're coming with us, right?

1640
01:56:21.099 --> 01:56:22.684
[Chuckles] Maisie, I...

1641
01:56:22.767 --> 01:56:23.810
Please.

1642
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.065
- I'll be on channel five.
- Okay.

1643
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:31.151
- We're on three.
- [Sighs]

1644
01:56:31.776 --> 01:56:32.777
Come back.

1645
01:56:33.695 --> 01:56:35.030
I always come back.

1646
01:56:36.156 --> 01:56:38.950
I'll have that chopper hot in ten.
Wait for my signal.

1654
01:57:14.528 --> 01:57:16.446
I have a lot of regrets.

1655
01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:17.531
Oh, yeah?

1656
01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:20.033
Well,

1657
01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:24.079
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1658
01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:29.334
What matters, I guess, is...

1659
01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:32.504
Is what we do now.

1660
01:57:33.129 --> 01:57:34.965
- Right?
- Yeah.

1661
01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:43.974

- Ah.

1662

They always come from the sides.

1666
01:58:05.287 --> 01:58:11.084
You know, at first we thought
they disembowel their prey, but no.

1667
01:58:12.294 --> 01:58:14.713
They're smart enough
to go straight for the throat.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

1736
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:25.064
[Claire]
All right, Kayla. We 're good to go.

1737
02:03:35.617 --> 02:03:36.743
Okay, cutie.

1738
02:03:43.541 --> 02:03:44.542
[Claire] Come here.

1739
02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:47.002
You all right?

1740
02:03:48.129 --> 02:03:49.297
- Hey.
- [Gun cocks]

1741
02:03:50.214 --> 02:03:51.215
{gasps}

1742
02:03:57.347 --> 02:03:58.556
I remember you.

1743
02:03:59.182 --> 02:04:00.767
Please. You have to listen to me.

1744
02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:02.727
You created an ecological disaster.

1745
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:04.228
And I can fix it.

1746
02:04:04.938 --> 02:04:08.149
Charlotte lock wood changed every cell
in Maisie's body.

1747
02:04:09.233 --> 02:04:10.735
It saved her life.

1748
02:04:10.818 --> 02:04:14.280
If I can understand
how Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1749
02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:17.533
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm.

1750
02:04:17.617 --> 02:04:19.452
Before it's too late.

1751
02:04:21.454 --> 02:04:22.455
It's okay.

1752
02:04:23.247 --> 02:04:24.248
It's okay.

1753
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:29.504
It's what she would've wanted.

1754
02:04:32.507 --> 02:04:33.508
Thank you.

1755
02:04:33.591 --> 02:04:34.592
[Ian] No, no, no.

1756
02:04:35.677 --> 02:04:37.470
[Ian] No, no, no, no, no.

1757
02:04:38.346 --> 02:04:39.347
Him?

1758
02:04:39.847 --> 02:04:42.350
Not him. Not him.
It's always him.

1759
02:04:42.433 --> 02:04:43.434
Every si...

1760
02:04:45.019 --> 02:04:46.771
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1761
02:04:47.772 --> 02:04:48.940
Yeah. Why?

1762
02:04:49.023 --> 02:04:50.566
[Helicopter whirring]

1763
02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:52.694
[Kayla] I have air. Meet me at the center.

1764
02:04:52.777 --> 02:04:56.406
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey. Do not land in here.

1765
02:04:56.489 --> 02:04:58.533
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1766
02:04:58.616 --> 02:05:00.201
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1767
02:05:00.284 --> 02:05:02.370
- [Bellows]
- Oh!

1768
02:05:36.487 --> 02:05:38.990
[T. Rex roars]

1769
02:06:01.888 --> 02:06:04.098
[Giganotosaurus roars]

[Both growling]

1771
02:06:32.627 --> 02:06:33.711
This isn't about us.

1772
02:06:38.716 --> 02:06:39.717
Go! Go!

1773
02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.364
[Ellie] Come on!

1774
02:07:03.366 --> 02:07:05.076
[Henry groans]

1775
02:07:05.159 --> 02:07:07.787
Oh, my god! Get him up!
Come on, come on!

1776
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:09.872
- [Ian] Come on.
- [All shouting]

1777
02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:13.459
Come on, come on, come on.

1778
02:07:18.047 --> 02:07:19.048
[Ellie] Come on!

1779
02:07:26.514 --> 02:07:28.850
[Roars]

1780
02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:31.853
[Maisie gasps]

1781
02:07:33.563 --> 02:07:34.563
Ellie, no!

1782
02:08:04.051 --> 02:08:05.469
Come on, Maisie! Go!

1783
02:08:07.555 --> 02:08:08.848
Ramsay, get in.

1784
02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:10.683
Come on, come on, come on.

1785
02:08:15.188 --> 02:08:17.106
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1786
02:09:19.835 --> 02:09:22.588
[Thunder crashing]

1787
02:09:41.565 --> 02:09:43.234
No, at every level.

1788
02:09:43.317 --> 02:09:45.903
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1789
02:09:45.987 --> 02:09:48.990
"Systemic corruption." You get that?
Write that down.

1790
02:09:49.073 --> 02:09:51.367
[Kayla] Yeah, it's crazy.

1791
02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.704
And then... and then we crashed
into this ice lake, right?

1792
02:09:54.787 --> 02:09:56.789
I mean,
they literally owe me a plane.

1793
02:09:56.872 --> 02:09:59.667
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1794
02:09:59.750 --> 02:10:01.877
before I take it to my contact
at <i>The Times.</i>

1795
02:10:04.213 --> 02:10:06.424
You could, uh, come with me.

1796
02:10:08.092 --> 02:10:10.511
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1797
02:10:13.514 --> 02:10:15.016
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

1798
02:10:17.685 --> 02:10:19.395
I am coming with you.

1799
02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:33.909
I know. One more minute,
then we'll send you home with your folks.

1800

- Uncomfortable.
- Trustworthy.

1808
02:11:36.931 --> 02:11:39.141
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1809

Yeah.

Life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.

1826

And dinosaurs were only a part of that.

1827
