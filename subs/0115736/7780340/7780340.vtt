1
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:02.834
I had this
image of you inside of me...

2
00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:04.876
Iike a part of me.

3
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.251
You planned this whole thing.

4
00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:15.042
We make our own
choice. We pay our own prices.

5
00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:17.417
Five years is a long time.

6
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.459
Where's the fuckin' money?

7
00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.542
All part of the business.

8
00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.251
All part of the business.

9
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.334
You made a choice once.

10
00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.417
What choice?

11
00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:39.959
I want out.

12
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.001
Like a part of me.

13
00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.917
Hold the elevator.

14
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.334
Thanks.

15
00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.626
Yeah, I looked over everything, sir.

16
00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.667
I don't think there should be
any problems.

17
00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.167
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity
and I looked at the tub.

18
00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.876
I'm pretty sure we can rout it out.

19
00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:22.126
Yeah, I'll start everything
first thing tomorrow.

20
00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.792
Thanks again for this opportunity,
Mr. Bianchini.

21
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.209
Yeah.

22
00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:00.834
Hi.

23
00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:03.792
My name is Violet.
We sort of met on the elevator.

24
00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:06.292
I'm Corky.

25
00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:10.792
I heard you working in here,
and I was wondering...

26
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.042
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

27
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.417
Sure.

28
00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:16.959
Come on in.

29
00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:18.917
Just give me a second.

30
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.334
All right.

31
00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.334
What happened to Rajiv?

32
00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:32.542
He went home to India or someplace,
but I think he'll be back.

33
00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.542
So this is just
a temporary situation for you?

34
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.667
Yeah, pretty much.
One day at a time.

35
00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:42.876
I guessed you're a straight black.

36
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.376
Good guess.

37
00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.501
Thanks.

38
00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.042
My pleasure.

39
00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:52.251
To be honest, I did have
a slightly ulterior motive.

40
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.209
I was wondering if I might
ask you a little favor.

41
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:57.251
- Favor.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:57.376 --> 00:04:59.917
I'm kind of a night person,
and I was wondering...

43
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:04.334
if you might wait a little bit
before you start using the power tools.

44
00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:07.084
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, no. No.

45
00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:12.126
It's not your fault. It's just
the walls here are so terribly thin.

46
00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:16.417
- Really.
- It's like you're in the same room.

47
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.751
If it's too much trouble,
I understand.

48
00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:21.751
It's no trouble at all.
I got a lot to do here.

49
00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:25.459
You doin' all the work yourself?

50
00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.292
That is so amazing.

51
00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:31.667
I am so in awe of people
who can fix things.

52
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:36.167
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.

53
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:39.084
Whenever anything was broken,
he would just...

54
00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:42.876
open it up, tinker with it
a little bit...

55
00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.459
and fix it.

56
00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:46.792
His hands were magic.

57
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:51.542
I'll bet your car
is 20 years old.

58
00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.042
Truck.

59
00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:55.042
Truck. Of course.

60
00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.417
- '63 Chevy.
- I knew it.

61
00:06:03.251 --> 00:06:06.876
Well, I guess I should be going.

62
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.417
You can drop the cup off
at any time.

63
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:13.251
Thanks.

64
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.584
My pleasure.

65
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:25.042
Ding Ding

66
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.542
- Ding You're no good, heartbreaker Ding
- Well, well.

67
00:06:30.626 --> 00:06:32.584
- It's been a long time, Cork.
- Ding Ding

68
00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:36.042
Five years, two months
and sixteen days.

69
00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:39.542
- How you doin', Sue?
- Like shit.

70
00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:42.417
Now that we're all caught up,
can I buy you a drink?

71
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.792
Thanks.

72
00:06:43.876 --> 00:06:48.042
- Ding Friends keep tellin' me Ding
- Welcome home.

73
00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:50.626
Ding That you ain't no good Ding

74
00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:52.834
Ding But, oh, oh, they don't know Ding

75
00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:54.834
Did you get a job yet?

76
00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:58.459
Yeah. Some plumbing,
painting and shit.

77
00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:02.709
I mean a J-O-B.
A real job.

78
00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:06.959
No. Not for me, Sue.

79
00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.459
I'm just here to get laid.

80
00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:14.167
Ding I ain't never gonna Ding

81
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.001
Ding Love a man Ding

82
00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:17.959
Ding The way that I Ding

83
00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:20.001
Ding I love you Ding

84
00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:27.584
Ding Some time ago I thought Ding

85
00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:31.834
Ding You had run out of fools Ding

86
00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.917
Ding But I was so wrong Ding

87
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:36.959
Ding Ding

88
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:39.292
- Hi.
- Hello.

89
00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:43.751
Hey, Jesse,
what's happenin' here?

90
00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:48.001
Wait. I know you.

91
00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.084
I don't think so.

92
00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.209
I didn't know you were out.

93
00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.917
When you get tired
of Cagney and Lacey, find me.

94
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.751
Ding Don't you never never say
that we're through Ding

95
00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:38.417
Ding Ding

96
00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:42.251
Ding Fast and slow
Night and day Ding

97
00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:44.376
Ding When you stop to think Ding

98
00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:47.292
Ding It just gets in the way Ding

99
00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:50.542
Ding And there's not a single soul
among us Ding

100
00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:57.292
Yeah.

101
00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:58.792
Hey, Mr. Bianchini.

102
00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:01.251
Everything's going just fine.

103
00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:04.709
Yeah, I got the tub drain
all cleaned out.

104
00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.251
What apartment?

105
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.667
Oh, no.

106
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:23.959
Shit! I didn't know
he would call you.

107
00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:26.876
You must think
I'm a total nuisance.

108
00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:28.501
Not exactly.

109
00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:30.834
I'm sorry. I would
usually call Rajiv...

110
00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.751
but I didn't know what to do,
so I called Mr. Bianchini.

111
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.751
- He said you lost something?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:39.917
Come on in.

113
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:50.542
I was doing the dishes, and just as I
pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

114
00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:54.167
That's why I got upset.
It's one of my favorites.

115
00:09:57.042 --> 00:09:58.834
You got a pot or a bucket?

116
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.917
Did you find it?

117
00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:42.334
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

118
00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.792
I can't thank you enough.
You have to let me pay you something.

119
00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:49.584
- No.
- No?

120
00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:53.376
Told Bianchini I'd do it.
I did it.

121
00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:56.501
If you won't take money,
how about a drink?

122
00:10:57.709 --> 00:10:59.709
You can't work all night.

123
00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:04.417
All right.

124
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.001
One drink.

125
00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:12.167
What would you like?

126
00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:13.626
Beer.

127
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.042
Beer.

128
00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:16.459
Of course.

129
00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:27.334
Sit down.

130
00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:44.584
Thanks.

131
00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:46.667
You seem uncomfortable.

132
00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:50.001
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

133
00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.667
No.

134
00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.251
Thirsty, maybe.

135
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.834
Curious, maybe.

136
00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:03.001
That's funny. I'm feeling
a little bit curious myself.

137
00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:07.167
That's a great tattoo.

138
00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:14.334
Beautiful labris.

139
00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.709
Are you surprised
I know what it is?

140
00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:18.126
Maybe.

141
00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:31.501
I have a tattoo.

142
00:12:33.126 --> 00:12:35.584
Would you like to see it?

143
00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:42.792
A woman in upstate New York
did it for me.

144
00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:47.501
Do you like it?

145
00:12:47.584 --> 00:12:49.709
Took her all day to do it.

146
00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:54.334
She promised
it wouldn't hurt, but...

147
00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:58.501
it was sore
for a long time after.

148
00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.917
I couldn't even touch it.

149
00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:06.584
Now I love
the way it feels.

150
00:13:10.626 --> 00:13:11.959
Here.

151
00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:17.084
Touch it.

152
00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:30.126
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

153
00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:33.709
I'm trying to seduce you.

154
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:36.417
Why?

155
00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:38.584
Because I want to.

156
00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:43.376
I've wanted to ever since I saw you
that day in the elevator.

157
00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:51.751
I know you don't believe me...

158
00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:53.834
but I can prove it to you.

159
00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:03.459
You can't believe what you'd see...

160
00:14:05.334 --> 00:14:09.209
but you can believe
what you feel.

161
00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:18.334
I've been thinking about you
all day.

162
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.376
You planned this whole thing.

163
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:41.292
You dropped that earring
down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

164
00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:45.542
If I say yes,
will you take your hand away?

165
00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:49.876
- No.
- Yes.

166
00:14:54.251 --> 00:14:56.251
Oh, please, Corky.

167
00:14:56.334 --> 00:14:57.834
Oh, please.

168
00:14:59.584 --> 00:15:01.042
Kiss me!

169
00:15:29.542 --> 00:15:31.334
- Oh, fuck!

170
00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:38.209
Violet! Vi, you home?

171
00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:40.334
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

172
00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:46.626
- What the fuck is this?
- I didn't--

173
00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:48.209
What the fuck is--

174
00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:52.084
Oh.

175
00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:54.542
Corky, this is Caesar.
Caesar, Corky.

176
00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:58.251
I thought--

177
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.126
It's fuckin' dark in here.

178
00:16:03.584 --> 00:16:06.042
Corky's doing some work
for Mr. Bianchini.

179
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:10.167
Oh, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

180
00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:13.626
I'm sorry. Hi.

181
00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:15.251
Welcome to the family.

182
00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.501
So you're working
with Rajiv, right?

183
00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.876
No. Rajiv's in India.

184
00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.001
She's doing the work herself.

185
00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:25.459
No shit.

186
00:16:25.542 --> 00:16:28.626
Bianchini hired you. You must be
pretty good with your hands.

187
00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:31.084
- He's a good friend of mine.
- That's what Violet says.

188
00:16:31.126 --> 00:16:32.501
Family really.

189
00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:35.917
- When did you get out?
- Jesus, Caesar.

190
00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.334
What? It ain't
no big fuckin' deal.

191
00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:40.751
I know who Don hires.

192
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:44.751
You know, he did time himself.
Thirteen fuckin' years.

193
00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:47.542
What did you do?

194
00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:50.584
- Five.
- Five.

195
00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:53.084
That's not bad. What for?

196
00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:55.584
That's none
of your goddamn business.

197
00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:58.292
You're right. She's right.
It's none of my goddamn business.

198
00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:00.834
You don't have to tell me.
It's just--

199
00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:03.167
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

200
00:17:04.042 --> 00:17:05.959
You're amongst good people here.

201
00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:16.001
Come on, come on.

202
00:17:17.084 --> 00:17:20.376
If you understand what I'm
talkin' about, you'll take the money.

203
00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:23.876
If you don't, then I'm gonna
have to worry about you.

204
00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:30.709
Good. I hate to worry.

205
00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:33.376
I got ulcers.

206
00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:38.042
I should be going.

207
00:17:38.084 --> 00:17:40.917
What? No, stick around.
Get her a drink.

208
00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:43.667
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

209
00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:45.126
Another time.

210
00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:48.376
Right. Another time.

211
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:10.001
Mmm, Corky, Corky.
What are you doing?

212
00:18:33.876 --> 00:18:36.626
I had to see you.

213
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:40.334
Look. I don't think
this is a good idea.

214
00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:42.751
I wanted to apologize.

215
00:18:42.792 --> 00:18:47.501
No, please, don't apologize.

216
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:50.834
If there's one thing I can't stand it's
woman who apologize for wanting sex.

217
00:18:57.459 --> 00:18:59.834
I'm not apologizing
for what I did.

218
00:19:00.876 --> 00:19:04.459
I'm apologizing
for what I didn't do.

219
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.501
You have a bed somewhere?

220
00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:06.042
I can see again.

221
00:21:26.126 --> 00:21:27.459
I needed that.

222
00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:32.126
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

223
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:34.084
You have to ask?

224
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:35.959
No.

225
00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:37.251
Funny.

226
00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:39.459
Nobody really
calls it that anymore.

227
00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:41.751
Caesar just calls it
"the business."

228
00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:44.126
How did you meet him?

229
00:21:44.209 --> 00:21:47.167
They took over a club
I was working at.

230
00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:49.126
Caesar started managing it.

231
00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:52.334
- He's a launderer?
- Basically.

232
00:21:52.376 --> 00:21:54.084
How long you been with him?

233
00:21:55.209 --> 00:21:56.709
About five years.

234
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.126
Five years is a long time.

235
00:22:01.209 --> 00:22:03.126
Yes, it is.

236
00:22:04.542 --> 00:22:06.584
The redistribution of wealth.

237
00:22:07.334 --> 00:22:10.292
- Excuse me?
- Isn't it what you wanted to know?

238
00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:12.334
What I did time for?

239
00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:15.417
"The redistribution of wealth"?

240
00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:18.501
That's what I tell someone
when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

241
00:22:18.542 --> 00:22:21.376
But I'm already in your bed.

242
00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:27.751
My cell mate would say
she did her time for getting caught.

243
00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:30.542
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

244
00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:34.959
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

245
00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:37.042
I guess I wanted to.

246
00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:42.751
I'm glad you did.

247
00:22:43.876 --> 00:22:45.792
So am I.

248
00:22:52.876 --> 00:22:56.126
Ding Let me tell you
about a girl I know Ding

249
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.167
Ding She is my baby
and she lives next door Ding

250
00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:02.459
Ding Every mornin'
before the sun comes up Ding

251
00:23:02.542 --> 00:23:04.792
Ding She brings my coffee
in my favorite cup Ding

252
00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:08.334
- Ding That's why I know... Ding
- You think I don't know that?

253
00:23:08.376 --> 00:23:09.917
Please. Come on.

254
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:12.417
Will you just--
I have to leave tonight.

255
00:23:13.834 --> 00:23:15.917
Don't make me beg, Violet.

256
00:23:18.042 --> 00:23:20.001
Two minutes. Thank you.

257
00:23:31.834 --> 00:23:33.334
Hey, Violet.

258
00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:34.959
You look great.

259
00:23:48.584 --> 00:23:53.084
I had this
image of you inside of me.

260
00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:56.417
Like a part of me.

261
00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:00.792
You are so beautiful.

262
00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:05.917
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

263
00:24:08.459 --> 00:24:12.292
Yes, there is.
You didn't want to see me, did you?

264
00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:15.334
If there's one thing I can't stand
about sleeping with women...

265
00:24:15.417 --> 00:24:17.417
it's all the fucking mind reading.

266
00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:21.584
- I don't understand.
- I know, Violet.

267
00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:24.542
That's 'cause you can't understand.
We're different.

268
00:24:24.584 --> 00:24:26.876
We're not that different, Corky.

269
00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:29.751
Ah, let's see.

270
00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:32.751
This is the part
where you tell me...

271
00:24:32.792 --> 00:24:35.209
what matters is on the inside...

272
00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:38.501
and that inside of you there's
a little dyke just like me.

273
00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:42.584
No, she's nothing like you.
She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

274
00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.667
Is that what her daddy tells her?

275
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:49.084
I know what I am. I don't have
to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

276
00:24:49.167 --> 00:24:53.209
-You saying you don't have sex with men?
-I don't.

277
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:59.584
For Christ's sake, I heard you.
Thin walls, remember?

278
00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:01.959
What you heard wasn't sex.

279
00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:05.251
What was it?

280
00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:07.959
Work.

281
00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:13.792
You made certain choices in your life
that you paid for.

282
00:25:13.876 --> 00:25:17.542
You said you made them because
you were good at something...

283
00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:19.501
and it was easy.

284
00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:22.292
You think you're the only person
that's good at something?

285
00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:27.792
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

286
00:25:27.876 --> 00:25:30.459
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

287
00:25:30.542 --> 00:25:32.876
What about that guy this morning?

288
00:25:33.751 --> 00:25:35.001
Shelly?

289
00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:37.834
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

290
00:25:39.126 --> 00:25:42.709
No, Shelly knows what I am.
He saw me in a bar with another woman.

291
00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:47.834
Yeah. I suppose
he just wants to watch.

292
00:25:47.917 --> 00:25:51.126
Fuck it.
I think you'd better leave.

293
00:25:51.209 --> 00:25:53.167
Yeah, I think I'd better.

294
00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:57.167
Try not to steal anything
on the way out.

295
00:27:14.417 --> 00:27:17.292
Where the fuck is it?

296
00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:20.209
I didn't
do it! I swear to you!

297
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:28.251
Come on!

298
00:27:28.292 --> 00:27:30.251
- Where is it?

299
00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:31.917
- Oh, that hurt, didn't it?
- Ow!

300
00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:36.959
- You think you're smart?

301
00:27:39.084 --> 00:27:41.042
Where's that fuckin' money?

302
00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.876
Please, please!

303
00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:45.584
Please, let me go!

304
00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:47.001
Please stop it!

305
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:51.626
Don't make me beg!

306
00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:53.709
Stop it! Please!

307
00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:58.459
- Please stop!
- Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

308
00:27:58.542 --> 00:28:02.167
You piece of shit.
We're goin' home.

309
00:28:03.292 --> 00:28:05.292
- Nobody fucks him!
- I'm not fucking him!

310
00:28:05.376 --> 00:28:07.084
I swear to God!

311
00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:08.542
Johnnie! Ho!

312
00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:12.167
He's making too much noise.

313
00:28:12.251 --> 00:28:14.376
You hear that, bitch?
Shut up.

314
00:28:18.209 --> 00:28:19.709
Give me a towel.

315
00:28:20.584 --> 00:28:22.167
Shut up!

316
00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:23.709
Here.

317
00:28:25.834 --> 00:28:27.376
Put it in his mouth.

318
00:28:41.292 --> 00:28:42.959
Caesar, I'm leaving.

319
00:28:44.084 --> 00:28:46.001
What? Why?

320
00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:50.251
- I didn't use a good towel.
- Caesar, I'm serious.

321
00:28:50.334 --> 00:28:52.542
I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

322
00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:53.917
Why?

323
00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:56.751
'Cause you know him?

324
00:28:58.001 --> 00:28:59.417
Aw, you see?

325
00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:03.126
Baby, that's what I love about you.

326
00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:05.209
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

327
00:29:07.042 --> 00:29:09.584
But I like you here.

328
00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:11.626
I want you to stay.

329
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:15.042
This is hard on me too.

330
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:16.667
I like Shelly.

331
00:29:18.084 --> 00:29:21.626
So why don't you watch some TV
and put on a cassette or something?

332
00:29:29.584 --> 00:29:30.917
You okay, Violet?

333
00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:34.751
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

334
00:29:34.834 --> 00:29:37.542
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck?

335
00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:41.251
Caesar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

336
00:29:41.334 --> 00:29:43.834
Sure. Sorry about that.

337
00:29:47.834 --> 00:29:49.751
You shouldn't have to see this.

338
00:29:49.834 --> 00:29:52.417
Why don't you get out of here?
Go for a walk.

339
00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.709
Caesar wants me to stay.

340
00:29:58.501 --> 00:30:02.209
Don't worry about Caesar.
I'll handle Caesar.

341
00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:05.542
Get out of here.

342
00:30:05.626 --> 00:30:08.251
- We can go all night, bitch.
- Okay.

343
00:30:08.334 --> 00:30:09.584
Thank you, Mickey.

344
00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:12.876
Here you go.

345
00:30:12.959 --> 00:30:15.626
All fuckin' night, baby!
All night!

346
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:25.834
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

347
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:30.459
Bitch!

348
00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:34.209
Pick him up.

349
00:30:43.126 --> 00:30:46.084
Shelly,

350
00:30:46.126 --> 00:30:49.334
I'm gonna ask you ten times.
You understand?

351
00:30:50.584 --> 00:30:51.834
Ten times.

352
00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:53.959
Yeah.

353
00:31:08.584 --> 00:31:10.667
One. Where's our money?

354
00:31:32.584 --> 00:31:34.251
You all right?

355
00:31:47.459 --> 00:31:49.917
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

356
00:31:52.917 --> 00:31:55.542
Keep it.

357
00:32:13.376 --> 00:32:15.334
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

358
00:32:17.084 --> 00:32:21.709
He came to see me yesterday
because he was afraid Caesar found out.

359
00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:24.501
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

360
00:32:24.584 --> 00:32:26.834
Even though he knew about you.

361
00:32:26.876 --> 00:32:29.834
- Yeah.
- This guy's in love with you?

362
00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:33.876
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

363
00:32:33.917 --> 00:32:37.792
He could have run at any time,
but he didn't want out.

364
00:32:37.876 --> 00:32:39.917
It sounds like
he wanted to get caught.

365
00:32:39.917 --> 00:32:42.209
Yeah. Maybe he did.

366
00:32:42.292 --> 00:32:45.292
He would brag to me
all the time.

367
00:32:45.376 --> 00:32:48.667
He was never afraid
of Caesar because...

368
00:32:48.751 --> 00:32:50.334
he didn't know him.

369
00:32:50.417 --> 00:32:51.751
Not like I do.

370
00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:55.876
I used to be able
to block it out.

371
00:32:57.251 --> 00:32:59.376
Or I'd just tell myself that...

372
00:33:00.709 --> 00:33:03.084
I wasn't really there,
and so...

373
00:33:04.501 --> 00:33:06.501
none of it really mattered.

374
00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:10.376
But I can't do that anymore.

375
00:33:12.542 --> 00:33:15.501
I'm making the same mistake
Shelly made...

376
00:33:16.542 --> 00:33:19.626
but now I know what I want.

377
00:33:24.126 --> 00:33:25.751
I want out.

378
00:33:28.376 --> 00:33:30.417
I want a new life.

379
00:33:33.209 --> 00:33:36.209
I see what I've been waiting for,
but I can't do it alone.

380
00:33:43.167 --> 00:33:45.626
I need your help, Corky.

381
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:53.792
- Caesar's gonna get the money--
- How much money?

382
00:33:53.876 --> 00:33:56.084
Shelly said it's over
two million dollars.

383
00:33:59.251 --> 00:34:02.292
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

384
00:34:02.376 --> 00:34:05.542
He's gonna bring it by the apartment.
He's gonna count it.

385
00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:08.584
He's gonna go through the books and try
and figure out how Shelly did it.

386
00:34:08.626 --> 00:34:11.417
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

387
00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:14.042
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

388
00:34:15.417 --> 00:34:17.542
Violet, these people are serious.

389
00:34:17.626 --> 00:34:20.334
You wanna know how serious?
Ask your friend Shelly.

390
00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:24.126
They're worse than any cop because they
have lots of money and no rules.

391
00:34:24.209 --> 00:34:26.251
You fuck them,
you better do it right.

392
00:34:26.292 --> 00:34:29.376
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.

393
00:34:29.459 --> 00:34:30.917
I am good.

394
00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:37.834
Let's just say for a moment
I believe everything you're saying.

395
00:34:37.917 --> 00:34:40.376
- You think I'm lying?
- I didn't say that.

396
00:34:41.917 --> 00:34:44.917
But since you did,
let's say you are.

397
00:34:45.001 --> 00:34:47.542
It would have been easy for you
to set up Shelly.

398
00:34:47.626 --> 00:34:49.292
You could have had him killed...

399
00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:51.542
knowing that Caesar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

400
00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:56.376
All you would need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected.

401
00:34:57.667 --> 00:34:59.209
Someone like me.

402
00:35:01.042 --> 00:35:03.126
Is that what you think?

403
00:35:03.209 --> 00:35:05.209
I'm just making a point.

404
00:35:07.876 --> 00:35:10.084
You have no idea
what you're asking...

405
00:35:11.334 --> 00:35:15.292
how much trust it takes two people
to do something like this.

406
00:35:18.542 --> 00:35:21.042
For me, stealing has always been
a lot like sex.

407
00:35:22.292 --> 00:35:24.751
Two people who want
the same thing.

408
00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:27.376
They get in a room,
they talk about it.

409
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:31.042
They start to plan.
It's like flirting.

410
00:35:32.251 --> 00:35:35.209
It's kind of like foreplay.

411
00:35:35.292 --> 00:35:38.626
Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

412
00:35:42.084 --> 00:35:44.709
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

413
00:35:46.542 --> 00:35:50.209
But to steal, I need to know someone
Iike I know myself.

414
00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:53.876
You think you know me like that?

415
00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:57.667
I wanna see the money.

416
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:02.334
Oh, my God!

417
00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:04.459
Don't worry.
It ain't mine.

418
00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:15.792
- Caesar, what happened?
- It was unbelievable, Vi.

419
00:36:15.876 --> 00:36:17.917
Un-fuckin'-believable!

420
00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:21.001
Shit! Look at this shirt.

421
00:36:21.084 --> 00:36:23.084
Look at it.
It's ruined.

422
00:36:23.167 --> 00:36:25.709
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

423
00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:28.584
I'll tell you something.
Mickey, he knows his shit.

424
00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:30.667
He does.
Shelly took us right there.

425
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:33.334
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right...

426
00:36:33.417 --> 00:36:36.792
and he's pulling out this money
from a safe on the floor...

427
00:36:36.876 --> 00:36:38.376
and I'm standin' there...

428
00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:40.542
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

429
00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:42.834
Like, "Holy fuck!"

430
00:36:42.876 --> 00:36:48.376
All I can think about is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this," when bang!

431
00:36:48.417 --> 00:36:51.542
Johnny caps him.
He caps Shelly!

432
00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:54.751
Blood goes flyin' everywhere.
All over me. All over the money.

433
00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:58.001
I have no idea
if this is even all of it.

434
00:37:00.042 --> 00:37:03.376
And right then,
I go through the roof and bam!

435
00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:05.376
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

436
00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.917
I punch him right in
his dumb fuckin' face.

437
00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.959
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

438
00:37:10.042 --> 00:37:14.292
I just wanted to hit him again-- smack
some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

439
00:37:14.334 --> 00:37:17.501
Look at the shit that
I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

440
00:37:17.584 --> 00:37:20.709
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I told him to run it through the cycle.

441
00:37:20.792 --> 00:37:23.917
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans...

442
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:26.917
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

443
00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:33.459
Where's the laundry detergent?

444
00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:35.542
It's in the linen cabinet.

445
00:37:55.417 --> 00:37:58.376
Come to my place
in the morning, early.

446
00:38:00.709 --> 00:38:03.417
You think you know me like that?

447
00:38:06.626 --> 00:38:08.417
Two million dollars.

448
00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:13.042
You're having second thoughts.

449
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:15.501
No.

450
00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:17.501
You said Caesar washed the money?

451
00:38:17.584 --> 00:38:20.792
- Yeah.
- Then what? Exactly.

452
00:38:20.876 --> 00:38:23.792
- He hung it up.
- He what?

453
00:38:23.876 --> 00:38:25.792
To let it dry.

454
00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:30.334
It was unreal.

455
00:38:38.376 --> 00:38:41.376
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
Iike leaves.

456
00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:52.376
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

457
00:38:59.459 --> 00:39:02.167
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

458
00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:10.417
All night long
I listened to that sound.

459
00:39:10.501 --> 00:39:13.292
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

460
00:39:19.584 --> 00:39:20.917
Where is it now?

461
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:23.667
It's in his office.

462
00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:25.709
I saw it this morning.

463
00:39:30.834 --> 00:39:32.792
I need to go to the store.

464
00:39:36.917 --> 00:39:39.292
It's in a case on his desk.

465
00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.459
Does the case lock?

466
00:39:41.542 --> 00:39:42.917
Yes.

467
00:39:44.001 --> 00:39:48.667
- Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

468
00:39:48.751 --> 00:39:50.709
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

469
00:39:50.792 --> 00:39:52.751
Like each other?
They hate each other.

470
00:39:52.792 --> 00:39:54.584
- Why?
- I don't know.

471
00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:56.751
Happened long before
I came around.

472
00:39:56.834 --> 00:40:00.459
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

473
00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:03.126
but, you know,
what can you do?

474
00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:05.792
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

475
00:40:05.876 --> 00:40:07.001
Who's Gino?

476
00:40:08.876 --> 00:40:10.417
Gino Marzzone.

477
00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:15.917
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

478
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:18.042
Yeah, that's his brother.

479
00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.584
Shit.

480
00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:25.292
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

481
00:40:25.334 --> 00:40:27.042
Yeah.

482
00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:29.626
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

483
00:40:29.709 --> 00:40:31.167
Yeah.

484
00:40:33.917 --> 00:40:36.042
Sweet Jesus.

485
00:40:42.834 --> 00:40:44.251
It's perfect.

486
00:40:44.334 --> 00:40:47.167
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

487
00:40:47.251 --> 00:40:50.251
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

488
00:40:50.334 --> 00:40:52.876
- Has Gino been to your place before?
- Yeah, twice.

489
00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:55.917
- What happened?
- Caesar was really nervous.

490
00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:58.209
He kept cleaning the apartment.

491
00:40:58.292 --> 00:41:01.501
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

492
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:03.501
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

493
00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:06.917
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

494
00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:11.084
- Did Caesar ever see this?
- He does it right in front of him.

495
00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.792
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

496
00:41:13.876 --> 00:41:17.917
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

497
00:41:18.001 --> 00:41:20.209
so he usually gets
right to the point.

498
00:41:20.209 --> 00:41:23.042
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

499
00:41:23.126 --> 00:41:25.251
They had a drink
and then they left.

500
00:41:25.334 --> 00:41:27.459
- What did Gino drink?
- Scotch.

501
00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:32.167
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

502
00:41:34.876 --> 00:41:36.709
All right.

503
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.709
I have an idea
how to make this work.

504
00:41:47.251 --> 00:41:50.042
Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

505
00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:53.667
What time did you say
they'd be there?

506
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:57.667
The plane gets in
at 7:00, so I'd say around 8:00.

507
00:41:57.751 --> 00:42:00.126
- All right.

508
00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:02.626
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

509
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:07.042
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

510
00:42:07.084 --> 00:42:11.751
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

511
00:42:11.834 --> 00:42:14.792
Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

512
00:42:14.876 --> 00:42:17.459
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

513
00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:21.709
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

514
00:42:21.751 --> 00:42:24.876
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

515
00:42:30.084 --> 00:42:32.792
You want him to relax, unwind.

516
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.376
You look good enough to eat.

517
00:42:37.626 --> 00:42:39.376
Where will you be?

518
00:42:39.459 --> 00:42:41.709
I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

519
00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:45.042
- Waiting for what?
- For the shower.

520
00:42:45.126 --> 00:42:47.084
That's gonna be our signal.

521
00:42:48.042 --> 00:42:50.959
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

522
00:42:52.417 --> 00:42:54.959
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

523
00:42:55.042 --> 00:42:58.292
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

524
00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:00.876
An accident.

525
00:43:03.167 --> 00:43:05.292
Vi, what the hell was that?

526
00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.001
Vi, you can't hear me?

527
00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:10.084
- Ah, fuck!
- Caesar, it slipped.

528
00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:13.167
- I was trying to get ready.
- How the fuck did you do that?

529
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:15.792
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

530
00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:18.584
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fuckin' time!

531
00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:20.626
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

532
00:43:20.709 --> 00:43:23.501
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

533
00:43:23.584 --> 00:43:25.167
Fuck, Vi!

534
00:43:31.834 --> 00:43:34.417
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

535
00:43:39.167 --> 00:43:40.959
What if he sees you?

536
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:42.667
He won't.

537
00:43:42.751 --> 00:43:45.667
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

538
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:50.167
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking. What if?

539
00:43:51.084 --> 00:43:52.751
If he does...

540
00:43:54.417 --> 00:43:56.459
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

541
00:43:59.917 --> 00:44:02.251
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

542
00:44:44.334 --> 00:44:46.917
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

543
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:48.917
Hide it near the desk.

544
00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:51.334
And at that point...

545
00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:56.209
there's no turning back.

546
00:45:08.334 --> 00:45:10.084
When I get the scotch...

547
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:13.251
how do I know
you won't just take off?

548
00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:17.667
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

549
00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:18.834
Trust.

550
00:45:18.876 --> 00:45:21.042
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

551
00:45:21.126 --> 00:45:23.084
with all the money
in the apartment.

552
00:45:23.126 --> 00:45:25.376
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

553
00:45:25.417 --> 00:45:26.792
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

554
00:45:26.876 --> 00:45:29.084
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

555
00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:31.209
You gotta be as real as you can.

556
00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:34.959
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

557
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.376
you'll be covered.

558
00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:40.876
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

559
00:45:40.959 --> 00:45:44.584
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

560
00:45:44.626 --> 00:45:45.876
he'll want to.

561
00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:49.209
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

562
00:45:50.251 --> 00:45:53.376
- What are you talkin' about?
- They just left, didn't they?

563
00:45:53.459 --> 00:45:56.376
- What, are you drunk?
- They weren't just up here?

564
00:45:56.459 --> 00:45:58.876
No, they're still on their way.

565
00:45:58.917 --> 00:46:00.626
That doesn't make any sense.

566
00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:05.417
- Why?
- I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

567
00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:09.292
What?

568
00:46:09.376 --> 00:46:12.834
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

569
00:46:14.959 --> 00:46:17.334
- Nah, it couldn't have been.
- It was him, Caesar.

570
00:46:17.417 --> 00:46:18.751
I'm positive.

571
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:22.167
Vi, that's impossible.

572
00:46:22.209 --> 00:46:25.209
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

573
00:46:25.209 --> 00:46:26.792
It was him.

574
00:46:26.834 --> 00:46:29.542
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

575
00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:32.876
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

576
00:46:32.917 --> 00:46:35.126
and give Gino the scotch, but...

577
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:38.417
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

578
00:46:41.542 --> 00:46:42.876
But...

579
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:46.292
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

580
00:46:50.542 --> 00:46:52.667
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

581
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:08.209
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

582
00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:11.917
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

583
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:15.876
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

584
00:47:15.917 --> 00:47:17.917
There's only one way out.

585
00:47:18.834 --> 00:47:20.167
He'll have to run.

586
00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:23.876
And if he runs...

587
00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:26.709
everyone will assume
he took the money.

588
00:47:26.792 --> 00:47:29.751
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

589
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:32.167
Jesus, that's beautiful.

590
00:47:33.751 --> 00:47:37.542
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

591
00:47:38.417 --> 00:47:40.626
I had a partner once.

592
00:47:40.709 --> 00:47:42.251
She fucked me.

593
00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:46.126
I won't.

594
00:47:49.292 --> 00:47:51.126
I think we're gonna find out.

595
00:47:55.709 --> 00:47:57.834
- Oh, God!
- Caesar?

596
00:48:00.251 --> 00:48:02.167
No.

597
00:48:02.959 --> 00:48:04.876
C?

598
00:48:06.542 --> 00:48:07.792
Oh, no.

599
00:48:09.792 --> 00:48:10.792
Oh, God.

600
00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:17.334
Vi.

601
00:48:17.417 --> 00:48:19.042
Vi, I've been set up.

602
00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:20.667
Johnnie?

603
00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:22.209
That fuck!

604
00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:25.501
That rat fuck!

605
00:48:25.584 --> 00:48:28.376
That motherless rat fuck!

606
00:48:28.459 --> 00:48:31.876
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

607
00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:39.459
Jesus Christ. Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

608
00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:41.792
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

609
00:48:43.334 --> 00:48:45.292
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

610
00:48:45.334 --> 00:48:48.459
- I fuckin' hate him.
- But you know he did it.

611
00:48:49.292 --> 00:48:52.292
Yeah. So what?
So fucking what?

612
00:48:53.584 --> 00:48:57.251
Look, the money is gone, right?

613
00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.126
Gino's coming to get it.

614
00:48:59.209 --> 00:49:02.459
Do you think Gino is going to believe me
when I tell him...

615
00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:05.459
his little rat fuck son stole it?

616
00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:08.334
'Cause I don't.
You know what I think?

617
00:49:08.417 --> 00:49:11.126
I'm a dead man.
I'm one in the back of the head.

618
00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:12.751
That's what I think.

619
00:49:14.709 --> 00:49:16.084
What are we gonna do?

620
00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:20.084
I know what Johnnie wants me to do.
Johnnie wants me to run.

621
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:22.084
He wants me outta here.

622
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:25.126
But if I run, then everybody thinks
I fucking did it...

623
00:49:25.209 --> 00:49:27.209
and he gets away
with two million clean.

624
00:49:29.209 --> 00:49:31.376
I can see him right now...

625
00:49:31.417 --> 00:49:33.501
on the way to get Gino,
Iaughin' at me!

626
00:49:33.584 --> 00:49:35.417
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me!

627
00:49:35.501 --> 00:49:37.209
Laughin' at me!

628
00:49:37.251 --> 00:49:39.251
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

629
00:49:41.251 --> 00:49:44.459
Don't! Please.
Don't touch me, okay?

630
00:49:44.542 --> 00:49:47.209
I gotta think. I gotta
fuckin' think this through!

631
00:49:48.917 --> 00:49:51.292
Caesar, I think we should run.

632
00:49:51.334 --> 00:49:54.042
We have to go now,
before it's too late!

633
00:49:54.126 --> 00:49:56.626
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

634
00:49:56.709 --> 00:49:58.167
Please, all right?

635
00:49:58.251 --> 00:50:00.417
Just leave me the fuck alone!

636
00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.501
All right, Caesar.

637
00:50:07.376 --> 00:50:10.542
I gotta think, that's all.
I just gotta think.

638
00:50:35.626 --> 00:50:37.626
- It's me.
- What happened?

639
00:50:37.709 --> 00:50:41.126
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

640
00:50:41.167 --> 00:50:42.959
He's out of his fucking mind.

641
00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:45.917
That's all right, as long as
he believes it was Johnnie.

642
00:50:45.959 --> 00:50:48.542
Believes it?
Jesus!

643
00:50:48.626 --> 00:50:51.626
It's driving him crazy.
He wants to kill him.

644
00:50:52.792 --> 00:50:54.792
I don't know, Corky.

645
00:50:54.876 --> 00:50:58.459
I'm getting really nervous.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

646
00:50:58.542 --> 00:51:01.459
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

647
00:51:01.501 --> 00:51:04.209
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

648
00:51:04.292 --> 00:51:06.251
What if he doesn't run?

649
00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:09.917
That means he'll probably
kill Johnnie.

650
00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:12.001
Oh, Christ!
I have to get out of here!

651
00:51:12.084 --> 00:51:16.876
Listen, if he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

652
00:51:16.959 --> 00:51:19.376
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

653
00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:22.376
Start crying. Tell him you love him,
but you can't take it.

654
00:51:22.459 --> 00:51:26.126
You're sorry, but you gotta leave,
and just walk out.

655
00:51:26.167 --> 00:51:28.251
All right. Okay.

656
00:51:28.334 --> 00:51:31.376
We're almost there.
Just hang on.

657
00:51:31.459 --> 00:51:32.584
He's coming!

658
00:51:35.209 --> 00:51:38.459
I know what I have to do.
I have to get the money back.

659
00:51:38.542 --> 00:51:41.376
The money?
The money's gone.

660
00:51:41.459 --> 00:51:44.751
No, Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

661
00:51:45.709 --> 00:51:47.084
It could be anywhere.

662
00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:49.209
There's not enough time, Violet.

663
00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:51.376
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino
at the airport, right?

664
00:51:51.459 --> 00:51:55.459
That means he's probably
got the money with him in the car.

665
00:51:55.542 --> 00:51:56.959
Did he see you?

666
00:51:57.042 --> 00:51:59.542
No.

667
00:51:59.626 --> 00:52:02.001
Good. That's good.

668
00:52:06.126 --> 00:52:08.292
That means I got the edge.

669
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:10.334
He doesn't know I know.

670
00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:15.876
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

671
00:52:17.292 --> 00:52:19.334
He wants me
to hand it to Gino.

672
00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:23.209
Then there's no doubt I did it.

673
00:52:24.667 --> 00:52:26.584
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

674
00:52:29.126 --> 00:52:31.167
But that's not gonna happen.

675
00:52:34.959 --> 00:52:38.126
That jack-off's not gonna set me up.
No way. Not like this.

676
00:52:39.876 --> 00:52:41.251
This is insane.

677
00:52:46.417 --> 00:52:47.917
What are you doin'?

678
00:52:49.126 --> 00:52:50.501
I'm leaving.

679
00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:54.126
I don't want any part of this shit.
I don't want to be involved.

680
00:52:54.209 --> 00:52:56.417
- You can't leave.
- The hell I can't.

681
00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:02.001
- I need you.
- You don't need me.

682
00:53:02.084 --> 00:53:04.001
You've never needed me.

683
00:53:04.084 --> 00:53:06.126
I can't help you, understand?

684
00:53:14.959 --> 00:53:16.917
I can't let you leave.

685
00:53:18.042 --> 00:53:21.542
If you're not with me,
I have to assume you're against me.

686
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:24.959
Caesar, this is crazy.

687
00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:28.209
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

688
00:53:29.584 --> 00:53:32.001
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of scotch by accident.

689
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.376
Maybe you didn't.

690
00:53:34.376 --> 00:53:37.376
I would've been so easy...

691
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:39.542
to let him in as you left.

692
00:53:41.126 --> 00:53:42.626
You can't believe that.

693
00:53:42.709 --> 00:53:44.876
I've seen the way he looks at you.

694
00:53:45.751 --> 00:53:47.751
He's always wanted you.

695
00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.709
Maybe two million bucks
finally bought you.

696
00:54:00.542 --> 00:54:01.959
I'm sorry, Violet.

697
00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.626
I wanna trust you.

698
00:54:08.709 --> 00:54:10.292
But you understand.

699
00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:20.501
I don't have any other choice.

700
00:54:39.167 --> 00:54:41.001
You sure you don't want a drink?

701
00:55:07.126 --> 00:55:08.626
- Hello.
- Yeah, we're here.

702
00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:10.626
- Hey, Johnnie.
- Open the fuckin' door.

703
00:55:10.709 --> 00:55:12.167
Sure. Come on up.

704
00:55:49.459 --> 00:55:50.709
Gino.

705
00:55:53.167 --> 00:55:56.042
Good to see you.
Vi, look who's here.

706
00:55:56.126 --> 00:55:58.126
Hello, Gino.
How are you?

707
00:56:05.709 --> 00:56:08.459
- You shouldn't have hit me.
- You wanna get into this now?

708
00:56:08.542 --> 00:56:10.167
No, Caesar, not now.

709
00:56:19.334 --> 00:56:21.834
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

710
00:56:37.334 --> 00:56:40.167
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

711
00:56:41.417 --> 00:56:44.334
And I'll have
whatever Violet's drinking.

712
00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:47.084
- I'm not drinking.
- Oh, well, then neither will I.

713
00:56:48.917 --> 00:56:51.126
No, I'll have
a Tanqueray and tonic.

714
00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.584
Caesar, two T&T's.

715
00:57:13.292 --> 00:57:17.167
Salud, eh?
Roy, Pop, Violet.

716
00:57:17.251 --> 00:57:18.584
Caesar.

717
00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:22.626
Uh-uh, no, no, Johnnie.

718
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:25.042
- I gotta make a bet.
- No goddamn phone. Not now.

719
00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:30.001
Cesare, come and sit.
We're gonna talk now.

720
00:57:30.084 --> 00:57:33.001
Johnnie, you too.
No, no.

721
00:57:36.542 --> 00:57:37.917
Cesare, look at me.

722
00:57:39.792 --> 00:57:41.876
Johnnie, he said to me
what happened.

723
00:57:43.959 --> 00:57:48.626
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor.
A personal favor for me, huh?

724
00:57:49.709 --> 00:57:53.126
You gotta start respecting Johnnie
the way you respect me.

725
00:57:55.292 --> 00:57:58.209
Good, good.

726
00:57:59.667 --> 00:58:03.126
And you, Johnnie,
you gotta stop acting stupid.

727
00:58:04.584 --> 00:58:07.042
You gotta earn this respect
that Cesare's gonna give.

728
00:58:11.459 --> 00:58:12.709
Good!

729
00:58:12.792 --> 00:58:14.084
Done!

730
00:58:16.917 --> 00:58:18.251
Now...

731
00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:22.251
where's my money?

732
00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:33.751
We know how this was done?

733
00:58:35.459 --> 00:58:37.667
Yeah. I know.

734
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:40.792
And it won't happen again?

735
00:58:42.459 --> 00:58:44.501
Good. Done. We go now.

736
00:58:44.584 --> 00:58:46.584
Wait a minute, Pop.
Jesus Christ.

737
00:58:46.667 --> 00:58:49.876
You got two hours
till your plane leaves.

738
00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:53.501
Just relax. Have a drink.

739
00:58:53.584 --> 00:58:57.126
Caesare, Glenlivet.

740
00:59:04.542 --> 00:59:06.667
So, Caesar, tell me something.

741
00:59:06.751 --> 00:59:08.792
What did it total out at?

742
00:59:09.876 --> 00:59:11.376
2.176.

743
00:59:11.417 --> 00:59:13.667
Unbelievable.

744
00:59:14.542 --> 00:59:16.126
Can you believe that, Violet?

745
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:18.334
Johnnie.

746
00:59:18.417 --> 00:59:20.417
I just wanna know one thing.

747
00:59:21.584 --> 00:59:24.501
Just one thing after he made
such a big deal about it.

748
00:59:25.584 --> 00:59:27.876
I'll bet it wasn't such a big deal,
huh, Caesar?

749
00:59:30.126 --> 00:59:31.667
What's that, Johnnie?

750
00:59:32.501 --> 00:59:34.334
The money.

751
00:59:34.417 --> 00:59:36.417
I'll bet it wasn't nothin'
to make it clean...

752
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:38.792
after you made such
a big fuckin' deal about it.

753
00:59:38.876 --> 00:59:40.876
- What I tell you--
- It's important to me, Pop.

754
00:59:40.959 --> 00:59:44.126
It's a simple question. If he'd
answer it, that's the end of it.

755
00:59:48.876 --> 00:59:50.376
Where's this goin', Johnnie?

756
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:54.292
Just admit it.

757
00:59:56.376 --> 00:59:57.834
Admit what?

758
00:59:57.876 --> 01:00:00.292
That you overreacted!

759
01:00:00.376 --> 01:00:03.417
You lost it! Not me.

760
01:00:05.459 --> 01:00:07.542
It was your mistake.

761
01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:10.917
You wanna play it this way?

762
01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:13.042
I could play it this way.

763
01:00:14.376 --> 01:00:17.292
You wanna know who made a mistake?

764
01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:20.542
Open the case.

765
01:00:20.626 --> 01:00:22.584
- Caesar.
- Shut up, Violet.

766
01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:24.584
This is between me and Johnnie.

767
01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:29.584
You wanna do this now?

768
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:34.167
Let's do it.

769
01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:39.334
Open the fuckin' case.

770
01:00:45.167 --> 01:00:47.084
Open the case.

771
01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:57.542
Where's the fucking key?

772
01:00:57.626 --> 01:00:59.126
You don't need a key.

773
01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:01.376
Then how the fuck can I open it?

774
01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.959
The same way you did before.

775
01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:07.626
What are you talking about?

776
01:01:10.126 --> 01:01:12.042
All right, Johnnie.

777
01:01:17.959 --> 01:01:19.417
Violet...

778
01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:22.709
get me another drink.

779
01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:44.126
- What is this?
- Don't you fucking move!

780
01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:46.626
- Where is it, fuckface?

781
01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:48.542
- Where's what?
- The money!

782
01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:52.626
Okay, Caesar, if you don't
put down that gun--

783
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.376
Sit down.

784
01:01:56.626 --> 01:01:58.542
Caesar, what is this?

785
01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:01.376
Gino, your son stole this money
to set me up!

786
01:02:01.459 --> 01:02:04.209
He fuckin' stole it,
and I can prove it!

787
01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:06.584
Violet, tell them.

788
01:02:06.667 --> 01:02:08.459
Tell them!

789
01:02:08.501 --> 01:02:11.084
For God's sake, Johnnie,
do what he says.

790
01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:14.959
For Christ's sake!
This isn't happening.

791
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:19.709
Next one blows off
your fuckin' dick!

792
01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:23.584
I'm looking at a dead man.
You're a fuckin' dead man!

793
01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:25.584
Enough!

794
01:02:25.626 --> 01:02:28.876
- Gino, don't.
- Do you point the gun at me?

795
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:34.417
Do you know who I am?
I am Gino Marzzone!

796
01:02:38.376 --> 01:02:40.292
No, Gino, please.

797
01:02:41.834 --> 01:02:44.209
Gino, sit down.

798
01:02:45.917 --> 01:02:47.709
We're family, Cesare.

799
01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:50.834
Family, Caesar.

800
01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:52.417
Family.

801
01:02:53.751 --> 01:02:55.167
Now...

802
01:02:56.917 --> 01:02:58.834
give it to me.

803
01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:11.042
Good man.

804
01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:47.792
Don't shoot.

805
01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:16.959
I had to do it, Violet.

806
01:04:17.001 --> 01:04:20.292
You saw it.
I had no choice.

807
01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:23.792
It was Johnnie.

808
01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:27.001
Lying rat fuck.
He made me do it.

809
01:04:28.334 --> 01:04:31.167
Hey! Hey!

810
01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:35.626
You stupid fuck!
You think you could set me up? Huh?

811
01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:43.626
I'm a dead man, Johnnie?
I'm a fucking dead man?

812
01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:46.459
Guess again, Johnnie.
Who's the dead man? Who?

813
01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:50.001
Who's dead, fuckface?
Who? Who?

814
01:04:50.084 --> 01:04:52.876
I can't hear you, Johnnie.
Guess again.

815
01:04:52.959 --> 01:04:56.834
Take another guess, Johnnie.
Take another fuckin' guess.

816
01:05:08.626 --> 01:05:10.209
What are you doing?

817
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.126
Maybe three hours.

818
01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:25.667
Caesar, what are you going to do?

819
01:05:27.042 --> 01:05:29.792
- We're gonna get the money back.
- What?

820
01:05:29.876 --> 01:05:34.042
Violet, if we get the money back,
then none of this ever happened.

821
01:05:34.084 --> 01:05:38.126
Caesar, you just killed
Gino Marzzone.

822
01:05:38.209 --> 01:05:42.126
No, I didn't.
Not if the bodies disappear.

823
01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:45.001
Not if the money's here.
Then they never showed up.

824
01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.709
What happened to them?

825
01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:50.667
I don't know.
Maybe we'll never know.

826
01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.959
My guess, it was a job.

827
01:05:58.209 --> 01:06:02.126
Maybe the Carpella's.
All part of the business.

828
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.709
Look, once we find the money,
then everything's gonna be all right.

829
01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.584
Somebody's coming.

830
01:06:17.667 --> 01:06:20.167
- Fuck!
- Oh, no.

831
01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:21.667
Fuck!

832
01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:26.459
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

833
01:06:26.542 --> 01:06:30.334
They're just cops.
Stall 'em as long as you can.

834
01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:50.376
Gino, man.

835
01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:55.959
Come on. Come on!

836
01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:10.167
Answer it.

837
01:07:17.459 --> 01:07:20.084
- Hello?
- This is the police, ma'am.

838
01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:21.626
The police?

839
01:07:21.709 --> 01:07:24.626
We had a report of gunfire.
Can you buzz us in, please?

840
01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:28.334
- Gunfire? Is this a joke?
- No joke, ma'am.

841
01:07:45.959 --> 01:07:48.167
- Please open the door.
- Um.

842
01:07:49.959 --> 01:07:53.042
How do I know
that you're really the police?

843
01:07:55.959 --> 01:07:58.917
Ma'am, you have to open the door.

844
01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:02.042
All right.

845
01:09:44.501 --> 01:09:49.042
Now, if you're thinking
about doing something stupid...

846
01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:54.292
remember, I just killed
Gino Marzzone.

847
01:09:54.334 --> 01:09:56.667
You understand what that means?

848
01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:00.542
They're just cops.

849
01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:14.626
See? We're for real.

850
01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:20.667
I'm sorry. It's just that
sometimes you hear stories.

851
01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:22.417
You did the right thing.

852
01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:33.334
Come on in.

853
01:10:37.084 --> 01:10:39.917
Hey, hey! Chicago's finest.

854
01:10:39.959 --> 01:10:42.584
How's it going tonight, fellas?

855
01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:44.251
Very good, sir?

856
01:10:44.334 --> 01:10:47.584
I'm sorry. I got a bum ear.
Can't hear shit with it.

857
01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:50.292
My name is Caesar,
and this here is my Violet.

858
01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:57.501
So, Violet tells me there's
some problems about gunshots.

859
01:10:57.542 --> 01:11:01.001
Uh, yes, sir.
A neighbor in the building called in.

860
01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:04.459
- I think we know what happened.
- Probably just the television.

861
01:11:05.792 --> 01:11:07.876
Oh, the television.

862
01:11:07.917 --> 01:11:10.584
Honey, why don't you turn it off?

863
01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.751
This happened before.

864
01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:16.751
This ear, I was born with it.

865
01:11:16.834 --> 01:11:20.626
- The batteries went dead on my hearing aid. I'm sorry.

866
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:22.584
- It's all right.
- No big deal.

867
01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:25.959
I hate to trouble you guys.
Can I get you a beer?

868
01:11:26.001 --> 01:11:28.751
Uh, no. Not on duty. Sorry.

869
01:11:29.876 --> 01:11:32.459
But, uh, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

870
01:11:35.126 --> 01:11:37.459
No. Sure.
It's right over here.

871
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.251
Thanks.

872
01:11:39.292 --> 01:11:41.959
Listen, do you mind
if I make myself a drink?

873
01:11:42.042 --> 01:11:43.584
Yeah, right there.

874
01:11:43.626 --> 01:11:46.292
Sure. Go right ahead, sir.

875
01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:13.584
This is a beautiful place.

876
01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:15.751
Thank you.

877
01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:29.792
Is this a condo?

878
01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:37.751
Okay, let's roll.

879
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:44.792
Oh, try to keep extra batteries
around for the aid, okay?

880
01:12:44.876 --> 01:12:46.376
Good idea.

881
01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:52.542
Come on. Let's go.

882
01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:03.209
Shit.

883
01:13:18.459 --> 01:13:20.459
Fuck! Where is it?

884
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:24.167
Think.

885
01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:28.209
It's gotta be at his place.

886
01:13:29.876 --> 01:13:31.626
Get in the car.

887
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:34.667
- Caesar, I don't think--
- Get in the fucking car!

888
01:13:58.959 --> 01:14:01.292
Two million dollars, Corky.

889
01:14:03.542 --> 01:14:08.042
Two million dollars.
It's gotta be here. It's gotta be.

890
01:14:08.126 --> 01:14:12.042
I just-- I gotta think.
Think like Johnnie.

891
01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:16.042
Okay, I'm Johnnie.

892
01:14:20.376 --> 01:14:22.292
I come in.

893
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:25.626
Where did I put it?

894
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:31.251
That's a lot of fuckin' money,
and I gotta hide it.

895
01:14:32.376 --> 01:14:34.542
I gotta hide it.
I don't have much time.

896
01:14:34.626 --> 01:14:38.959
I gotta get to the airport,
pick up my fuckin' daddy!

897
01:14:45.834 --> 01:14:49.084
I can't wait to see Caesar's face
when he finds out.

898
01:14:59.334 --> 01:15:02.709
- Where did he put it?
- C.

899
01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:08.376
Think. Think.

900
01:15:17.001 --> 01:15:19.626
Where is it, you motherfucker?

901
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:21.626
Where? Where?

902
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:41.417
C?

903
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:45.417
C.

904
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:54.834
It's not here, Caesar.

905
01:15:58.917 --> 01:16:00.834
Where is it?

906
01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:05.167
I don't know.
It could be anywhere.

907
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:07.959
We don't even know
if he was alone, Caesar.

908
01:16:08.042 --> 01:16:11.042
Come on.
We have to get out of here.

909
01:16:11.084 --> 01:16:13.167
We don't have much time.

910
01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:22.334
What are you doing?

911
01:16:34.126 --> 01:16:37.501
Gotta buy more time. More time.

912
01:16:37.584 --> 01:16:40.042
Who are you gonna call?

913
01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.334
- Yeah?
- Hey, Mickey.

914
01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:52.876
Oh, God.

915
01:16:54.501 --> 01:16:56.417
Caesar, what the fuck time is it?

916
01:16:56.501 --> 01:17:00.584
Oh, Mickey, did I wake you up?
Listen, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

917
01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:03.959
I don't know if this is a big deal,
but they ain't showed up yet.

918
01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:06.001
What? They ain't there?

919
01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:10.042
No. I-I-I called the airport.
The plane landed on time.

920
01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.584
I even called over at Johnnie's house,
but there was no answer there.

921
01:17:13.667 --> 01:17:16.792
Okay. Let me call around.
I'll see what I can do.

922
01:17:16.834 --> 01:17:18.792
Don't go anywhere, okay?

923
01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.959
Yeah, okay, sure.

924
01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:23.917
Caesar, you still have the money?

925
01:17:24.001 --> 01:17:25.959
Oh, yeah, Mickey,
I still got the money.

926
01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:28.709
Starin' right at it.

927
01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:31.584
Good. Sit tight.
I'll call you.

928
01:17:33.292 --> 01:17:34.709
Bye.

929
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:49.792
So I'll start packing.
You know what you have to do.

930
01:17:49.876 --> 01:17:53.417
I'll use Johnnie's car
to dump the bodies in the lake.

931
01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:56.209
I need plastic bags, rope and tape.

932
01:17:57.292 --> 01:17:59.709
Just hurry.

933
01:18:12.792 --> 01:18:14.792
Please, Corky, please.

934
01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:22.167
- Thank God.
- I'm still here.

935
01:18:22.251 --> 01:18:24.626
I was so afraid
you were going to leave me.

936
01:18:25.917 --> 01:18:28.209
You don't quit on me, Violet.
I won't quit on you.

937
01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.709
Corky, it worked.
He's going to run.

938
01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:40.709
He needs to take care of the bodies
to buy himself a little time...

939
01:18:40.792 --> 01:18:43.209
but as soon as he leaves,
it's over.

940
01:18:43.292 --> 01:18:45.334
Just a little while longer.

941
01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:48.501
Corky...

942
01:18:52.876 --> 01:18:54.792
I want to tell you something.

943
01:18:54.876 --> 01:18:56.792
I know, Violet.

944
01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:02.001
I know.

945
01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:07.584
It's why I'm still here.

946
01:19:25.084 --> 01:19:26.667
Who was that?

947
01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:29.084
Vi, who the fuck was that?

948
01:19:31.542 --> 01:19:34.667
Did you call Mickey?
Did you call Mickey?

949
01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:36.667
Did you!

950
01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:59.501
Mickey, is that you?

951
01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:00.584
Fuck.

952
01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:28.292
Who is that?
Who's over there?

953
01:20:28.376 --> 01:20:31.626
Who's over there?
Tell me! Tell me!

954
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:35.917
No! Stop! Caesar! Caesar!

955
01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:45.001
No! No! No! Caesar!

956
01:21:31.042 --> 01:21:33.542
Drop the fucking gun or die.

957
01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:36.459
Drop it!

958
01:21:36.501 --> 01:21:37.917
Turn around.

959
01:21:43.459 --> 01:21:44.917
You?

960
01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:48.834
Holy fucking Christ.

961
01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:55.667
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

962
01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:04.626
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

963
01:22:06.126 --> 01:22:08.251
Hey!

964
01:22:08.334 --> 01:22:10.126
Come on!

965
01:22:10.209 --> 01:22:12.792
Wake up. Wake up.

966
01:22:16.584 --> 01:22:19.667
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

967
01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.751
Good.

968
01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:26.709
I know everything now.

969
01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:30.334
So I don't wanna hear any
"I don't know" bullshit, understand?

970
01:22:32.626 --> 01:22:37.042
God, I should've seen this coming
the minute I met you.

971
01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:41.751
Everybody knows
your kind can't be trusted.

972
01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:45.042
Fuckin' queers.
You make me sick.

973
01:22:49.334 --> 01:22:51.459
But you made a fatal mistake.

974
01:22:51.542 --> 01:22:53.959
You tried to fuck the wrong guy...

975
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:56.709
and I swear to you...

976
01:22:56.792 --> 01:22:58.876
I'm gonna kill you for it.

977
01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:01.751
Where's my money?

978
01:23:01.834 --> 01:23:04.626
Don't tell him.
He can't kill you.

979
01:23:04.667 --> 01:23:07.876
- Violet.
- Not until he has the money.

980
01:23:14.501 --> 01:23:17.834
Now, where is it?

981
01:23:17.917 --> 01:23:19.501
Lick me.

982
01:23:19.584 --> 01:23:23.417
Where is my money?

983
01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:28.751
Either pull the trigger, or get
that fucking thing out of my face.

984
01:23:28.792 --> 01:23:30.792
Fuckin' cunt.

985
01:23:30.834 --> 01:23:33.542
Caesar, stop acting
Iike an asshole and think.

986
01:23:33.584 --> 01:23:36.126
Violet, don't try
to tell me what to do.

987
01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:38.459
You need the money just like we do.

988
01:23:38.542 --> 01:23:41.042
- Shut up!
- Let us go. We'll make a deal.

989
01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:43.334
Shut the fuck up!

990
01:23:44.959 --> 01:23:47.542
What did you do to her, huh?

991
01:23:47.626 --> 01:23:50.251
What did you fuckin' do to her?

992
01:23:50.334 --> 01:23:52.459
That's not my Violet!

993
01:23:54.376 --> 01:23:56.376
What did she do to you?

994
01:23:56.459 --> 01:23:58.251
Everything you couldn't.

995
01:24:04.376 --> 01:24:06.417
You ungrateful fuckin' bitch.

996
01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:11.792
Vi, you were nothing
before you met me.

997
01:24:11.876 --> 01:24:14.001
Don't you remember?
You had nothing.

998
01:24:15.376 --> 01:24:18.126
Who gave you this place, huh?

999
01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:20.167
Who gave it to you?

1000
01:24:20.251 --> 01:24:22.792
I did, Vi. I did.

1001
01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:26.376
You were nothing.
You had nothing.

1002
01:24:26.459 --> 01:24:30.501
What a load of crap.
Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

1003
01:24:30.584 --> 01:24:34.084
You're nothing but a common thug.
You launder money for the Mob.

1004
01:24:34.167 --> 01:24:36.501
You rent women
Iike you rented this apartment.

1005
01:24:36.584 --> 01:24:40.834
You used me, Caesar.
That's all. Just like I used you.

1006
01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:43.501
All part of the business.

1007
01:24:43.584 --> 01:24:46.084
You betrayed me.

1008
01:24:46.167 --> 01:24:47.876
You murdered Gino.

1009
01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:51.001
Yeah, sure. You made me.
I had to do that.

1010
01:24:51.084 --> 01:24:53.584
Bullshit! You did it.

1011
01:24:53.626 --> 01:24:56.417
You did it because you couldn't stand
the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

1012
01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:57.917
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

1013
01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:00.417
All right, Violet. All right!

1014
01:25:00.459 --> 01:25:03.376
You want the business, Violet?
All of the business?

1015
01:25:03.459 --> 01:25:06.751
I'll fucking give it to you.
I'll give you all of it.

1016
01:25:06.834 --> 01:25:09.251
I'm gonna make you fuckin' suffer.

1017
01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:12.459
Just like Shelly, Violet.
Just like fuckin' Shelly.

1018
01:25:19.126 --> 01:25:20.584
I'm sorry, Corky.

1019
01:25:20.667 --> 01:25:24.292
Don't be sorry.
Help me.

1020
01:25:32.626 --> 01:25:35.042
Oh, no, no, no!

1021
01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:40.792
Hey, Vi, do you remember these?

1022
01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:47.042
All right,
I'm gonna start with Violet.

1023
01:25:48.751 --> 01:25:52.376
So you get an idea
of what's comin'.

1024
01:25:58.084 --> 01:26:00.751
I'm gonna ask you ten questions.

1025
01:26:02.084 --> 01:26:05.709
Every time I don't get an answer...

1026
01:26:08.959 --> 01:26:11.042
I cut off a finger.

1027
01:26:18.959 --> 01:26:20.959
Where's the money?

1028
01:26:33.459 --> 01:26:35.001
It's Mickey.

1029
01:26:39.251 --> 01:26:42.959
I said, "Where's the money?"

1030
01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:45.626
- All right, I'll tell you.

1031
01:26:47.417 --> 01:26:49.251
It's in the apartment next door.

1032
01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:51.376
I put it in the paint drums.

1033
01:26:51.459 --> 01:26:56.251
Good. Now, I promised you
I would kill you. Remember?

1034
01:26:56.334 --> 01:26:58.626
You can't kill me.

1035
01:26:58.709 --> 01:27:01.126
Oh, really? Why not?

1036
01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:02.834
I could be lying.

1037
01:27:05.292 --> 01:27:07.501
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

1038
01:27:25.126 --> 01:27:26.584
Motherfucker!

1039
01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:31.501
Son of a bitch.

1040
01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:39.709
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1041
01:28:25.876 --> 01:28:30.876
I can kill you right now,
if that's what you want.

1042
01:28:30.959 --> 01:28:33.584
Or you can live.

1043
01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:35.959
But I need your help.

1044
01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:39.667
You gotta help me make Mickey believe
that everything is normal.

1045
01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:42.584
Now, what do you wanna do?

1046
01:28:42.667 --> 01:28:45.376
Do you wanna live?

1047
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:20.042
Oh! Oh, shit!

1048
01:29:20.126 --> 01:29:24.709
Christ! Mickey, you scared
the shit out of me.

1049
01:29:26.792 --> 01:29:29.209
What are you guys doin'
with your peckers in your hand?

1050
01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:31.209
You gonna do me, Mickey?

1051
01:29:32.751 --> 01:29:34.334
No. There was no answer.

1052
01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:37.001
I thought I heard some knocking
at the door.

1053
01:29:37.084 --> 01:29:39.001
I was buzzing, I was knocking...

1054
01:29:39.084 --> 01:29:41.626
but I guess you couldn't hear me
on account of being in the shower.

1055
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:44.709
Yeah, well, you know, Mick,
I'm all wound up.

1056
01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:48.292
I'm driving myself crazy
over this Gino thing, and, well...

1057
01:29:48.376 --> 01:29:51.834
Vi, you know, she thought maybe...

1058
01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:56.376
she could, you know,
relax me in the--

1059
01:29:58.584 --> 01:30:01.709
That Violet is one nice lady.

1060
01:30:03.417 --> 01:30:05.417
I wish someone
would help me relax.

1061
01:30:05.459 --> 01:30:10.251
Uh, let me get you guys
a drink, huh?

1062
01:30:10.334 --> 01:30:13.251
I got scotch,
whatever you want.

1063
01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:18.209
We was worried about you.

1064
01:30:18.292 --> 01:30:19.917
Me? Why?

1065
01:30:20.001 --> 01:30:22.667
We went over to Johnnie's place,
just to check it out.

1066
01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:24.417
It was busted up, bad.

1067
01:30:24.501 --> 01:30:26.292
What?

1068
01:30:26.376 --> 01:30:28.834
Started thinking
maybe it's about the money.

1069
01:30:28.917 --> 01:30:32.542
So I call you,
but all I got is the busy signal.

1070
01:30:32.626 --> 01:30:35.584
I figure the phone is off the hook.
That's why I come rushing over here.

1071
01:30:35.626 --> 01:30:39.001
Fuck, the phone. Shit.
That was me. I did that.

1072
01:30:39.084 --> 01:30:42.584
Fuck! That was
a stupid thing to do, huh?

1073
01:30:43.834 --> 01:30:47.334
Hey, if Violet
was helping me relax...

1074
01:30:47.417 --> 01:30:49.292
I'd probably do the same thing.

1075
01:31:12.542 --> 01:31:14.917
Hey, Caes, can I ask you something?

1076
01:31:14.959 --> 01:31:16.917
Sure.

1077
01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:20.501
Why did you move
all the furniture around?

1078
01:31:25.001 --> 01:31:26.709
Let me guess.

1079
01:31:27.751 --> 01:31:30.167
That was Violet's idea too.

1080
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:35.792
Yeah, uh, actually...

1081
01:31:35.876 --> 01:31:38.626
she was nervous
about Gino comin'...

1082
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:40.709
and wanted everything
to look perfect and--

1083
01:31:40.792 --> 01:31:42.709
You know women, Mick.

1084
01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:47.292
Sure, Caes. They make us do
stupid things, don't they?

1085
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:56.417
- Is that the money?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1086
01:31:56.501 --> 01:31:58.126
What did it total out at?

1087
01:31:58.209 --> 01:32:00.251
2.176.

1088
01:32:00.334 --> 01:32:02.251
That fuckin' Shelly.

1089
01:32:03.501 --> 01:32:05.626
Gotta hand it to the guy,
but, Jesus...

1090
01:32:05.667 --> 01:32:08.459
if I were him, I would've
bailed a long time ago.

1091
01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:13.042
I mean, how much money
does a man need?

1092
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:19.417
I remember, I was just staring
at all this goddamn money.

1093
01:32:19.501 --> 01:32:22.834
Shelly went down on his knees...

1094
01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:26.667
and the next thing I know,
Johnnie just blows his head off.

1095
01:32:28.417 --> 01:32:30.751
What a fuckin' mess.

1096
01:32:30.834 --> 01:32:32.792
Johnnie's laughing his ass off...

1097
01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:36.292
and that's when Caesar lost it.

1098
01:32:36.334 --> 01:32:37.834
And boom.

1099
01:32:37.917 --> 01:32:40.334
He cold-cocked him.

1100
01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:44.542
He cold-cocks fuckin'
Johnnie Marzzone.

1101
01:32:48.459 --> 01:32:51.834
Hey, Caesar.

1102
01:32:55.334 --> 01:32:56.792
Where's the key?

1103
01:32:57.876 --> 01:33:00.084
Um, the key--

1104
01:33:02.584 --> 01:33:06.626
Oh, they're in my pants
in the bathroom.

1105
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:09.876
Ah, fuck it.
I don't need the key.

1106
01:33:11.959 --> 01:33:14.584
I didn't need a key
to get in here, did I?

1107
01:33:37.126 --> 01:33:39.376
- Who the hell could that be?

1108
01:33:44.084 --> 01:33:45.542
Are you gonna answer it?

1109
01:33:45.584 --> 01:33:47.084
Yeah.

1110
01:33:55.917 --> 01:33:57.667
- Hello?
- Hello, Caesar.

1111
01:33:57.751 --> 01:33:59.751
- This is Gino.
- What?

1112
01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:03.251
You're blowing your only chance,
asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

1113
01:34:04.792 --> 01:34:07.751
Holy Christ! We've been
worried sick about you, Gino.

1114
01:34:07.834 --> 01:34:09.292
- Good boy.
- It's Gino.

1115
01:34:09.334 --> 01:34:11.501
- Where the hell is he?
- We were in a car accident.

1116
01:34:11.584 --> 01:34:14.209
- They were in a car accident.
- But everybody's all right.

1117
01:34:14.292 --> 01:34:17.334
Everybody's all right.
Just bruises and shit.

1118
01:34:17.376 --> 01:34:20.334
Un-fucking-believable. I called
those highway patrols. Dumb fucks.

1119
01:34:20.417 --> 01:34:22.334
Mick, please.
I'm trying to hear Gino.

1120
01:34:22.417 --> 01:34:25.584
Now you listen to me, asshole.
I know your gun is behind the bar.

1121
01:34:25.667 --> 01:34:28.751
Either we make a deal right now,
or I hand this phone to Mickey.

1122
01:34:28.834 --> 01:34:30.251
I'm listening.

1123
01:34:30.334 --> 01:34:34.834
All right. I want what's mine.
I want half the money.

1124
01:34:34.917 --> 01:34:37.876
We get rid of Mickey,
and no one else dies.

1125
01:34:37.917 --> 01:34:41.167
No one. Say, "Yes, I understand."

1126
01:34:41.251 --> 01:34:43.167
Yes, I understand.

1127
01:34:43.251 --> 01:34:46.542
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's
off the Kennedy in the waiting room.

1128
01:34:46.626 --> 01:34:49.209
Stay on the phone
until I come out.

1129
01:34:49.292 --> 01:34:52.251
Okay. Right.

1130
01:34:52.334 --> 01:34:54.501
St. Mary's off the Kennedy.

1131
01:34:54.542 --> 01:34:56.167
Yeah.

1132
01:34:56.251 --> 01:34:57.834
Johnnie's okay?

1133
01:34:57.917 --> 01:35:00.334
Mickey?
What are you doing here?

1134
01:35:00.417 --> 01:35:03.167
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.
They were in a car accident.

1135
01:35:03.209 --> 01:35:05.251
Oh, my God!
Is everybody all right?

1136
01:35:05.334 --> 01:35:07.501
- I think everything's okay.
- All right. Bye.

1137
01:35:07.584 --> 01:35:09.709
They're at St. Mary's.
Can you fucking believe this?

1138
01:35:09.792 --> 01:35:11.959
I can't fit them all in my car,
so give me your keys.

1139
01:35:12.042 --> 01:35:13.501
- Sure.
- You drive my car.

1140
01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:15.834
Vi! Vi!

1141
01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:19.876
Do me a favor. Go in my pants
in the bathroom and get my keys.

1142
01:35:19.917 --> 01:35:22.917
Come on. Let's go.
Vi, let's go!

1143
01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:36.417
- Thanks, V.
- Call me as soon as you get there.

1144
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:38.584
Leave your phone on the hook.

1145
01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:45.376
Now, that's teamwork.

1146
01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:48.292
I should've let 'em kill you.

1147
01:35:48.334 --> 01:35:50.584
He would've done you too.

1148
01:35:50.667 --> 01:35:52.626
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1149
01:35:52.667 --> 01:35:56.501
Relax. I said
I would let you live...

1150
01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.876
and I will.

1151
01:36:00.167 --> 01:36:01.626
Maybe.

1152
01:36:09.251 --> 01:36:13.042
Let's go see if your dyke
was dumb enough to lie.

1153
01:36:13.126 --> 01:36:15.251
Let's go.

1154
01:36:40.751 --> 01:36:41.959
Yes.

1155
01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:44.501
No!

1156
01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:48.792
Violet!

1157
01:36:56.167 --> 01:36:58.084
Violet! Violet!

1158
01:37:04.751 --> 01:37:06.667
Violet!

1159
01:37:39.292 --> 01:37:41.209
Come on, please.

1160
01:37:49.542 --> 01:37:52.251
Bitch! You fuckin' bitch!

1161
01:38:15.834 --> 01:38:17.334
- Mickey?
- Violet?

1162
01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:20.167
Oh, God, Mickey.
He made me do it.

1163
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:22.792
I was so afraid.
I didn't want to, Mickey.

1164
01:38:22.876 --> 01:38:25.876
It was Caesar, all Caesar.
He made me help him.

1165
01:38:25.959 --> 01:38:30.251
You have to help me.
Oh, God! Oh, God, he's coming!

1166
01:38:45.834 --> 01:38:47.876
Corky?

1167
01:38:53.417 --> 01:38:54.834
Oh, fuck.

1168
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:55.584
Stop!

1169
01:39:56.667 --> 01:39:58.459
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1170
01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:04.376
It's over, Caesar.

1171
01:40:05.792 --> 01:40:08.209
I called Mickey.
He's on his way.

1172
01:40:10.084 --> 01:40:13.001
Get out of here, Caesar.

1173
01:40:13.084 --> 01:40:15.834
If you want to live,
you'd better start running.

1174
01:40:17.917 --> 01:40:20.584
All these years,
and you still don't know me.

1175
01:40:23.959 --> 01:40:25.417
But I know you.

1176
01:40:25.459 --> 01:40:27.084
Caesar, don't.

1177
01:40:28.459 --> 01:40:31.501
What are you gonna do
with that, Vi? Shoot me?

1178
01:40:33.084 --> 01:40:36.376
Kill me in cold blood?
I don't think so.

1179
01:40:36.459 --> 01:40:40.417
If you were gonna shoot me, Vi,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

1180
01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:45.542
If I were you, I'd have shot me
the minute I brought the money back.

1181
01:40:45.626 --> 01:40:49.876
But you didn't,
and I'll tell you why.

1182
01:40:49.959 --> 01:40:52.334
You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

1183
01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:55.667
Do you?

1184
01:40:56.751 --> 01:40:58.084
Do you?

1185
01:40:59.584 --> 01:41:01.042
I know you don't.

1186
01:41:03.667 --> 01:41:06.417
Caesar, you don't know shit.

1187
01:41:53.209 --> 01:41:57.417
I'll never understand it,
Mickey. You didn't even call the police.

1188
01:41:57.501 --> 01:42:01.417
I told you. The family
doesn't want the police around.

1189
01:42:01.501 --> 01:42:04.417
We want to take care of it
ourselves, and we will.

1190
01:42:05.626 --> 01:42:08.834
I'll find him.
I swear I will.

1191
01:42:08.917 --> 01:42:10.834
I know you will.

1192
01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.167
Sure you're gonna be okay?

1193
01:42:15.209 --> 01:42:18.792
I mean, if you're having
second thoughts...

1194
01:42:20.459 --> 01:42:22.626
my offer still stands.

1195
01:42:22.667 --> 01:42:26.751
Thanks, Mickey,
but I have to get out.

1196
01:42:26.834 --> 01:42:31.084
You know, I have to get away
from all this.

1197
01:42:31.167 --> 01:42:33.126
But thanks.

1198
01:42:39.959 --> 01:42:41.876
Thanks for everything.

1199
01:43:15.126 --> 01:43:17.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

1200
01:43:17.334 --> 01:43:19.542
So, how'd it go?

1201
01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:22.709
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Mm-hmm.

1202
01:43:29.376 --> 01:43:31.917
Well, I thought we might need
a getaway car.

1203
01:43:32.001 --> 01:43:33.084
Hmm.

1204
01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:38.792
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Violet?

1205
01:43:38.876 --> 01:43:40.792
No.

1206
01:43:40.876 --> 01:43:42.792
Me, neither.

1207
01:43:50.251 --> 01:43:51.792
Ding Well, she's all you'd ever want Ding

1208
01:43:51.876 --> 01:43:55.209
Ding She's the kind I'd like to flaunt
and take to dinner Ding

1209
01:43:58.376 --> 01:44:03.501
Ding

1210
01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:08.167
Ding She's a lady Ding

1211
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:12.167
