it takes two people to
do something like this.

00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.112

stealing has always been
a lot like sex.

who want the same thing,

545

they talk about it.

546

They start to plan.
It's kind of like flirting.

547

It's kind of
like foreplay.

they talk about it,
the wetter they get.
