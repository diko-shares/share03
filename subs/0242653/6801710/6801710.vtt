00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:22.709
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.419
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.254
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:28.381
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:31.634
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:33.261
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:36.097
ROLAND: Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:38.725
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.604
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:49.068 --> 00:01:50.778
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:52.655
Thank you.

12
00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.366
Any change?

13
00:01:56.117 --> 00:01:58.244
No.

14
00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:03.124
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:05.918
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:10.256
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.592
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.928
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:20.183
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.645
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:29.984
MORPHEUS: Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.403
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:35.782
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:37.283
Please, for me.

25
00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.505
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.674
What?

27
00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.552
MAGGIE: His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.639
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:59.806 --> 00:03:03.142
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:18.157
The big <i>bupkiss. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.535
COLT: Sir, I got the projections.
ROLAND: How long?

32
00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:25.248
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:28.042
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.839
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:36.175
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:38.469
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:40.513
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.808
- Hey! You got a call.
ROLAND: What?

39
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:47.353
Operator.

40
00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:50.106
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:54.527
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.000
Good morning.

43
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:13.755
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:18.009
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.179
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.394
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.484
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.945
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:42.074
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:46.788
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:50.291
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:54.378
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:13.606
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:16.567
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:19.821
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:23.074
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:30.081
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:33.125
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:36.879
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:39.966
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:45.096
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:46.639
What choice?

63
00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:49.934
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:55.022
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.026
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:01.779
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:06.242
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:10.288
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:15.167
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:19.672
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.385
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:24.552 --> 00:06:27.722
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.350
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:34.687
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.689
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:41.402
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:46.157
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:50.077
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.747
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:56.584
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.215
Oracle....

82
00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:05.593
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.513
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.310
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:16.228
I don't.

86
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.065
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:23.527
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:29.116
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.703
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.790
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:37.291
No.

92
00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:41.379
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:45.549
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:49.470
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:51.138
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.647
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:03.609
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:08.489
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.658
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:11.242 --> 00:08:13.452
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:18.082
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:22.336
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.006
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:30.094
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:32.847
It's okay.

106
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.682
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:38.394
- I don't even know where "here" is.
RAMA: This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.355
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:45.860
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:48.237
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:48.404 --> 00:08:52.366
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:55.411
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:59.540
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:02.960
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:03.127 --> 00:09:04.754
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.883
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.635
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:13.846
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14.013 --> 00:09:17.308
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:20.227
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:28.194
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.906
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:34.784
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.620
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:41.165
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:45.002
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:49.924
- You do not understand.
- I just have never--

128
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.468
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:57.598
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:57.765 --> 00:10:02.144
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:07.566
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.113
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.614
Anything.

134
00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:15.783
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.245
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:28.879
That's him.

- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.970
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

- It is already late.

It's not like the Trainman to be late.

00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:58.219
You think it has something
to do with me?

146
00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.720
I cannot say.

147
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:02.723
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

148
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.768
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

149
00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:08.687
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

150
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:11.398
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

Goodbye?

152
00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:16.403
- You're not staying with her?
RAMA: It is not possible.

153
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.616
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

156
00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:30.834
Karma is a word, like love.

157
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.795
A way of saying:

158
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.214
"What I am here to do."

159
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:39.009
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

Why wouldn't she leave?

against their entire defense system?
