1
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.507
I got nothing, sir. No
sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.176
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.469
Should we jack in and
try to contact them?

4
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.263
It wouldn't matter. My
gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:29.806
Then we should start back.

6
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:31.599
No. If that ship can
still fly, we need it.

7
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.318
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

8
00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.300
Search every pipe, every
hole, every crack we know.

9
00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.745
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

10
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.941
Captain, these lines are
crawling with calamari.

11
00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:42.819
Then the sooner we
find them the better.

12
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.621
Thought you could use
something to eat.

13
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:51.622
Thank you.

14
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.307
Any change?

15
00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.050
No.

16
00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:02.923
- How is he?
- He's going to be fine.

17
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:05.634
At least until he wakes up.

18
00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:07.360
What do you mean?

19
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.390
Captain has some
questions for him.

20
00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:12.549
He better have some good answers.

21
00:02:12.857 --> 00:02:16.285
You see these cuts? I think
they're self-inflicted.

22
00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:20.198
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

23
00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.961
But like I said, the
answer had better be good.

24
00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:30.041
Roland. I'd like to run another
search through the Matrix.

25
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.544
- For what?
- For Neo.

26
00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.964
How could he be in the Matrix,
sir? He's not plugged in.

27
00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.842
Please, for me.

28
00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:50.562
This is what keeps bothering me.

29
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.314
What?

30
00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:56.609
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

31
00:02:56.818 --> 00:02:59.737
The strange thing is, I see
these patterns all the time.

32
00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:04.617
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

33
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.214
The big bubkis. Nada.
He's not in there.

34
00:03:18.423 --> 00:03:20.592
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

35
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.652
Based on the point of
entry and the past speed

36
00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:25.800
it looks like the machines will be
in Zion in just under 20 hours.

37
00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:28.600
Jesus H. Christ.

38
00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.702
All right, let's
move with a purpose.

39
00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:33.600
AK, get upstairs, I want
you on holographics.

40
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.483
Mauser, I want forward and aft
guns manned at all times.

41
00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:38.802
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

42
00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:40.500
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

43
00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:43.374
- Hey hey. We got a call.
- What?

44
00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:47.535
Operator.

45
00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:50.914
It's Seraph.

46
00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:54.144
I bring word from The Oracle.
You must come at once.

47
00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:09.015
Good morning.

48
00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:10.435
Who are you?

49
00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.800
My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

50
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.370
My papa says you're not
supposed to be here.

51
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.171
He says you must be lost.

52
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.250
Are you lost, Neo?

53
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.511
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

54
00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:34.560
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

55
00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:38.703
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

56
00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:42.666
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

57
00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:46.545
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

58
00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:50.048
But my papa says we have to
do what the Trainman says

59
00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:54.770
or else he will leave us
here forever and ever.

60
00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:13.905
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

61
00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.641
One thing I've learnt
in all my years

62
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.619
is that nothing ever works out
just the way you want it to.

63
00:05:19.828 --> 00:05:24.249
- Who are you?
- I'm The Oracle.

64
00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.755
I wish there was an easier
way to get through this,

65
00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:28.956
but there ain't.

66
00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.841
I'm sorry this had to happen.

67
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.595
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting
here like you remember me,

68
00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.650
but it wasn't meant to be.

69
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:39.851
What happened?

70
00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.950
I made a choice,

71
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:45.070
and that choice cost me
more than I wanted it to.

72
00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:46.688
What choice?

73
00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:49.691
To help you, to guide Neo.

74
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.825
Now, since the real
test for any choice is

75
00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:54.026
having to make the
same choice again,

76
00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:58.783
knowing full well
what it might cost,

77
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.938
I guess I feel pretty
good about that choice,

78
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:06.041
because here I am, at it again.

79
00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.228
Do you know what happened to Neo?

80
00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:09.229
Yes.

81
00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.150
He is trapped in a place

82
00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:15.000
between this world and
the machine world.

83
00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:19.346
The link is controlled by a
program called the Trainman.

84
00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:24.142
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

85
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.540
If he finds out where Neo
is before you get to him,

86
00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.500
then I'm afraid our choices are
going to become difficult.

87
00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:32.504
Why?

88
00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:34.750
Because of who the
Trainman works for.

89
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.404
The Merovingian.

90
00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:39.100
He has placed a
bounty on your lives.

91
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.301
You must be careful at all times.

92
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.733
Seraph knows how to
find the Trainman.

93
00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:46.034
He'll go with you.

94
00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:49.751
For years he has protected me.

95
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.380
I hope he can do the same for you.

96
00:06:53.588 --> 00:06:57.801
Please, follow me.

97
00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:02.848
Oracle...

98
00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:05.225
I know, Morpheus.

99
00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:07.600
I can see you're
filled with doubt,

100
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:09.390
clouded by uncertainty.

101
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.900
After everything
that has happened,

102
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:14.450
how can you expect
me to believe you?

103
00:07:14.492 --> 00:07:16.161
I don't.

104
00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.997
I expect just what
I've always expected:

105
00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.701
For you to make up
your own damn mind.

106
00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:23.502
Believe me or don't.

107
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.632
All I can do is tell you that
your friend is in trouble,

108
00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:28.433
and he needs your help.

109
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.886
He needs all our help.

110
00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:35.764
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

111
00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:37.182
No.

112
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.000
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

113
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.857
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

114
00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.586
Sati. Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

115
00:07:49.694 --> 00:07:52.614
Yes, Papa.

116
00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.496
I am sorry. She is
still very curious.

117
00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:01.290
I know you.

118
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:03.650
Yes, in the restaurant
of the Frenchman.

119
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.355
I am Rama-Kandra.

120
00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:08.400
This is my wife, Kamala.
My daughter, Sati.

121
00:08:08.963 --> 00:08:10.707
We are most honoured to meet you.

122
00:08:11.216 --> 00:08:13.843
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

123
00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:16.485
I am the power-plant
systems manager

124
00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:18.260
for recycling operations.

125
00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:21.250
My wife is an interactive
software programmer.

126
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.500
She is highly creative.

127
00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:25.079
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

128
00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:30.052
Kamala. Goodness, I apologise.
My wife can be very direct.

129
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:32.946
It's okay.

130
00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:34.656
I don't have an answer.

131
00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:36.715
I don't even know where "here" is.

132
00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.390
This place is nowhere.

133
00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:41.631
It is between your
world and our world.

134
00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:46.126
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

135
00:08:46.334 --> 00:08:48.253
Why'd I know you were
going to say that?

136
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:52.590
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

137
00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.385
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

138
00:08:55.593 --> 00:08:58.614
I know that if you want to
take something from our world

139
00:08:58.615 --> 00:08:59.615
into your world,

140
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.892
that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

141
00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:04.686
Is that what you're doing here?

142
00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:06.250
Rama, please.

143
00:09:06.251 --> 00:09:08.151
I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

144
00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:11.693
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

145
00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:13.778
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.675
You don't have to
answer that question.

147
00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:17.176
No, I don't mind.

148
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:19.603
The answer is simple.

149
00:09:26.124 --> 00:09:28.126
I love my daughter very much.

150
00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.360
I find her to be the
most beautiful thing

151
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.361
I have ever seen.

152
00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.757
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

153
00:09:34.966 --> 00:09:37.694
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

154
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:41.139
If it does not, it is deleted.

155
00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.836
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

156
00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:49.898
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

157
00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:53.026
Heard a program speak of love.

158
00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:57.572
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

159
00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:00.820
What matters is the
connection the word implies.

160
00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:07.999
I see that you are in love.

161
00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:09.740
Can you tell me
what you would give

162
00:10:09.741 --> 00:10:11.441
to hold on to that connection?

163
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.713
Anything.

164
00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:16.262
Then perhaps the reason you
are here is not so different

165
00:10:16.263 --> 00:10:17.763
than the reason I am here.

166
00:10:26.643 --> 00:10:27.643
That's him.

167
00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:32.899
- Get away. Get away from me.
- We don't want trouble.

168
00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:35.985
- Get the hell away from me.
- We need your help.

169
00:10:36.194 --> 00:10:41.241
I can't help you. No
one can help you.

170
00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:33.460
Oh, no.

171
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:45.637
Damn it.

172
00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:53.271
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

173
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.107
It's not like the
Trainman to be late.

174
00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:58.050
You think it has
something to do with me?

175
00:11:58.351 --> 00:11:59.400
I cannot say.

176
00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:02.739
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

177
00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:05.742
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

178
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.640
I consulted with her before
I met with the Frenchman.

179
00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:10.150
She promised she would
look after Sati

180
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:11.451
after we said goodbye.

181
00:12:11.623 --> 00:12:13.541
Goodbye?

182
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.377
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

183
00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:18.260
Our arrangement with the Frenchman

184
00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:19.761
was for our daughter only.

185
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:23.010
My wife and I must
return to our world.

186
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:24.011
Why?

187
00:12:24.552 --> 00:12:27.472
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

188
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.850
Karma is a word, like love.

189
00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:32.811
A way of saying:

190
00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:35.230
"What I am here to do."

191
00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:38.850
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

192
00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:40.638
Grateful for my wonderful wife,

193
00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.100
for my beautiful daughter.

194
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.700
They are gifts,

195
00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:45.901
and so I do what I must
do to honour them.

196
00:12:48.576 --> 00:12:52.350
- Papa, the train.
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

197
00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:56.202
Can I carry that for you?

198
00:12:58.211 --> 00:12:59.273
All right.

199
00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:06.950
Hurry it up, I'm late.

200
00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:13.642
Who are you?

201
00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.937
- He is a friend.
- Rama.

202
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.773
I know you.

203
00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:23.653
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

204
00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:26.197
I'll pay you whatever you want.

205
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:28.545
One way or another, I'm
getting on this train.

206
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.702
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.088
You're going to stay right here

208
00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:33.700
until the Merovingian
says different.

209
00:13:33.997 --> 00:13:35.498
If I know him,

210
00:13:35.707 --> 00:13:39.377
you're going to be here
for a long, long time.

211
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:43.423
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

212
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:46.217
I built this place.

213
00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:48.202
Down here, I make the rules.

214
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.603
Down here, I make the threats.

215
00:13:56.436 --> 00:14:00.690
Down here, I'm god.

216
00:14:01.566 --> 00:14:04.200
Get on the train or you'll
stay here with him.

217
00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:24.088
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

218
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.910
No. We know what has to be done.

219
00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:43.982
Shit.

220
00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:14.848
You got to be kidding.

221
00:15:15.056 --> 00:15:17.642
Holy shit, it's wingless.

222
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.352
I get it.

223
00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:22.564
You must be ready to die.

224
00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:24.150
I need to speak with him.

225
00:15:24.182 --> 00:15:26.037
The only way you're
getting through this door

226
00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:29.100
is over my big, dead ass.

227
00:15:29.946 --> 00:15:31.040
So be it.

228
00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:56.890
There are no weapons
allowed in the club.

229
00:15:57.098 --> 00:16:00.518
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl,

230
00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:04.105
and if we are lucky, one
man for checking weapons.

231
00:16:04.314 --> 00:16:06.149
And if we're unlucky?

232
00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:09.652
There will be many men.

233
00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:12.170
Can I take your...? Oh, my god.

234
00:18:34.464 --> 00:18:36.326
What in the hell?

235
00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:43.014
I don't believe this.

236
00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:50.271
Hey. Hey.

237
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:55.980
Is the prodigal child returns?

238
00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:58.738
L'ange sans ailes.

239
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.085
Are you here for the
bounty, Seraph?

240
00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:07.500
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

241
00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:10.583
I don't know, but I don't
think you have enough.

242
00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:13.586
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

243
00:19:13.795 --> 00:19:15.165
I'm sure you do.

244
00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:17.866
You have fought through
hell to do so.

245
00:19:17.867 --> 00:19:18.867
Yes?

246
00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:21.511
I'll tell you what I will do.

247
00:19:21.719 --> 00:19:22.790
Put down the guns,

248
00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:25.791
and I will promise you a
safe passage out of here.

249
00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:29.352
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

250
00:19:29.561 --> 00:19:32.856
Of course.

251
00:19:54.678 --> 00:19:57.450
Quelle bonne surprise, n'est pas?

252
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.135
Who could've guessed we'd all
be seeing each other so soon

253
00:20:01.136 --> 00:20:02.990
after our last meeting?

254
00:20:03.595 --> 00:20:06.431
The Fates are too kind?

255
00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:10.201
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here

256
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.400
I can only surmise

257
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:14.101
that the fortuneteller has
found herself another shell?

258
00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:18.568
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

259
00:20:18.777 --> 00:20:19.990
I do hope, however,

260
00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:22.100
she has the good manners
to learn her lesson,

261
00:20:22.447 --> 00:20:25.475
and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

262
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.150
And if you take something from me,

263
00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:29.988
you will pay the price.

264
00:20:31.206 --> 00:20:32.717
You know why we are here?

265
00:20:34.626 --> 00:20:36.775
Come now, what kind
of question is this?

266
00:20:36.776 --> 00:20:37.876
Of course I know.

267
00:20:37.962 --> 00:20:40.006
It is my business to know.

268
00:20:40.215 --> 00:20:42.325
Some might think this is
a strange coincidence,

269
00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:43.326
but I do not.

270
00:20:43.885 --> 00:20:49.383
I am curious, though, as to
how it actually happened.

271
00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:52.477
- Do you know?
- No.

272
00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.395
No?

273
00:20:54.604 --> 00:20:56.731
I did not think so.

274
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.818
But it is always best to ask, huh?

275
00:21:00.026 --> 00:21:01.888
We want to make a deal.

276
00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:07.951
Always straight to
business, huh, Morpheus?

277
00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:12.455
Okay. I have something you want.

278
00:21:12.664 --> 00:21:14.582
To make a deal,

279
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:20.296
you must have something
I want, yes?

280
00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:24.801
And it so happens there
is something I want.

281
00:21:25.009 --> 00:21:29.347
Something I have wanted ever
since I first came here.

282
00:21:29.556 --> 00:21:32.559
It is said they cannot be taken,

283
00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:35.061
they can only be given.

284
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.381
What?

285
00:21:39.107 --> 00:21:41.269
The eyes of The Oracle.

286
00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:46.608
I have told you before,

287
00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:49.009
there's no escaping the
nature of the universe.

288
00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:51.628
It is that nature that has
again brought you to me.

289
00:21:51.736 --> 00:21:55.665
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

290
00:21:55.874 --> 00:21:58.126
Where others see chance,

291
00:21:58.334 --> 00:22:03.256
I see cost.

292
00:22:04.048 --> 00:22:07.594
Bring me the eyes of The Oracle,

293
00:22:07.802 --> 00:22:11.181
and I will give you
back your saviour.

294
00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:14.752
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

295
00:22:16.561 --> 00:22:18.130
Yes? No?

296
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:21.850
I don't have time for this shit.

297
00:22:53.807 --> 00:22:56.434
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

298
00:22:56.643 --> 00:22:58.895
You give me Neo, or we all die,

299
00:22:58.896 --> 00:23:00.710
right here, right now.

300
00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:06.027
Interesting deal.

301
00:23:06.778 --> 00:23:12.534
You are really ready
to die for this man?

302
00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:15.662
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

303
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.665
If she has to, she'll
kill every one of us.

304
00:23:18.873 --> 00:23:21.084
She's in love.

305
00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:22.430
It is remarkable

306
00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:26.600
how similar the pattern of love
is to the pattern of insanity.

307
00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:28.341
Time's up.

308
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.553
What's it going to be, Merv?

309
00:23:34.722 --> 00:23:38.601
Okay. You got yourself in here,

310
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.814
you can get yourself out.

311
00:24:29.152 --> 00:24:30.320
Are you ready for us?

312
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:31.375
Almost, sir.

313
00:24:31.376 --> 00:24:33.576
They got some pretty ancient
hacks here, we're working on it.

314
00:24:33.698 --> 00:24:35.784
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

315
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.900
No, sir.

316
00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:38.835
We were reading something, but
I couldn't tell what it was.

317
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.961
I can't leave yet.

318
00:24:48.046 --> 00:24:49.340
I have to see her.

319
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:52.049
Now?

320
00:24:54.385 --> 00:24:55.922
It's my last chance.

321
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.683
That's it. That's the secret.

322
00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:03.353
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

323
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:07.607
Cookies need love
like everything does.

324
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:09.567
Neo.

325
00:25:09.776 --> 00:25:13.032
I was hoping to have these
done before you got here.

326
00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:14.533
Oh, well.

327
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.910
Sati, honey, I think
it's time for a tasting.

328
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:21.955
Take the bowl to Seraph and
find out if they're ready.

329
00:25:22.163 --> 00:25:24.707
Okay.

330
00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:28.878
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

331
00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:34.634
So, do you recognise me?

332
00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:38.012
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

333
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:41.015
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

334
00:25:41.224 --> 00:25:44.721
I don't yet recognise my
face in the mirror, but...

335
00:25:46.646 --> 00:25:50.066
I still love candy.

336
00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:52.402
No, thank you.

337
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.870
Remember what you were like

338
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:55.750
when you first walked
through my door,

339
00:25:55.947 --> 00:26:00.910
jittery as a junebug? And
now, just look at you.

340
00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:04.581
You sure did surprise me,
Neo, and you still do.

341
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:07.792
You gave me a few surprises too.

342
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:10.253
I hope I helped.

343
00:26:10.462 --> 00:26:13.923
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

344
00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:15.800
Where is this going?

345
00:26:16.009 --> 00:26:18.636
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

346
00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.657
You don't know or
you won't tell me?

347
00:26:20.658 --> 00:26:22.358
I told you before,

348
00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:26.545
no one can see beyond a
choice they don't understand,

349
00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:27.846
and I mean no one.

350
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.300
What choice?

351
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:32.130
It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

352
00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:35.028
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

353
00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:37.056
Does that include what
things to tell me

354
00:26:37.057 --> 00:26:38.257
and what not to tell me?

355
00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:39.866
Of course not.

356
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.035
Then why didn't you tell
me about the Architect?

357
00:26:42.076 --> 00:26:43.550
Why didn't you tell me about Zion,

358
00:26:43.551 --> 00:26:44.611
and the Ones before me?

359
00:26:44.615 --> 00:26:46.623
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

360
00:26:47.248 --> 00:26:49.430
Because it wasn't
time for you to know.

361
00:26:49.431 --> 00:26:51.031
Who decided it wasn't time?

362
00:26:51.586 --> 00:26:53.030
You know who.

363
00:27:00.887 --> 00:27:03.431
I did.

364
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.935
Then I think it's time for me
to know a few more things.

365
00:27:07.143 --> 00:27:08.978
So do I.

366
00:27:09.187 --> 00:27:11.460
Tell me how I separated
my mind from my body

367
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:12.461
without jacking in.

368
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:16.319
Tell me how I stopped four
sentinels by thinking it.

369
00:27:16.528 --> 00:27:18.716
Tell me just what the
hell is happening to me.

370
00:27:22.242 --> 00:27:25.745
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

371
00:27:25.954 --> 00:27:27.120
It reaches from here

372
00:27:27.121 --> 00:27:29.460
all the way back to
where it came from.

373
00:27:29.707 --> 00:27:31.918
- Where?
- The Source.

374
00:27:32.127 --> 00:27:35.337
That's what you felt when you
touched those sentinels.

375
00:27:35.338 --> 00:27:37.215
But you weren't ready for it.

376
00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:38.920
You should be dead,

377
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:41.621
but apparently you weren't
ready for that either.

378
00:27:44.689 --> 00:27:47.110
The Architect told me that if I
didn't return to the Source,

379
00:27:47.111 --> 00:27:49.411
Zion would be destroyed
by midnight tonight.

380
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.020
Please.

381
00:27:51.021 --> 00:27:54.350
You and I may not be able to
see beyond our own choices,

382
00:27:54.357 --> 00:27:57.402
but that man can't
see past any choice.

383
00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.610
Why not?

384
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:01.225
He doesn't understand
them. He can't.

385
00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:04.117
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

386
00:28:04.325 --> 00:28:05.490
One at a time,

387
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:08.535
each variable must be
solved, then countered.

388
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.459
That's his purpose. To
balance the equation.

389
00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:14.752
What's your purpose?

390
00:28:14.961 --> 00:28:16.963
To unbalance it.

391
00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:19.674
Why? What do you want?

392
00:28:19.883 --> 00:28:23.344
I want the same thing
you want, Neo.

393
00:28:23.553 --> 00:28:26.723
And I am willing to go as
far as you are to get it.

394
00:28:26.931 --> 00:28:29.851
The end of the war.

395
00:28:30.059 --> 00:28:32.061
Is it going to end?

396
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.731
One way or another.

397
00:28:34.939 --> 00:28:36.968
Can Zion be saved?

398
00:28:38.777 --> 00:28:42.660
I'm sorry, I don't have the
answer to that question, but...

399
00:28:44.449 --> 00:28:46.180
If there is an answer,

400
00:28:46.181 --> 00:28:49.281
there's only one place
you're going to find it.

401
00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:52.325
- Where?
- You know where.

402
00:28:53.925 --> 00:28:56.312
And if you can't find the answer,

403
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.900
then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

404
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.000
What does that mean?

405
00:29:09.224 --> 00:29:11.811
Everything that has a beginning,

406
00:29:13.019 --> 00:29:14.600
has an end.

407
00:29:15.647 --> 00:29:18.066
I see the end coming.

408
00:29:18.775 --> 00:29:20.811
I see the darkness spreading.

409
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.580
I see death.

410
00:29:23.988 --> 00:29:26.917
And you are all that
stands in his way.

411
00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:29.786
Smith.

412
00:29:29.994 --> 00:29:33.000
Very soon, he is going
to have the power

413
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:34.455
to destroy this world.

414
00:29:34.456 --> 00:29:36.185
But I believe he won't stop there.

415
00:29:36.186 --> 00:29:37.186
He can't.

416
00:29:37.418 --> 00:29:40.588
He won't stop until there's
nothing left at all.

417
00:29:40.797 --> 00:29:42.132
What is he?

418
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.259
He is you.

419
00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:46.845
Your opposite, your negative.

420
00:29:47.053 --> 00:29:50.765
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

421
00:29:50.974 --> 00:29:55.478
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

422
00:29:55.687 --> 00:29:58.898
this war is going to end.

423
00:29:59.107 --> 00:30:02.300
Tonight, the future of both worlds

424
00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:05.570
will be in your hands or in his.

425
00:30:22.505 --> 00:30:26.551
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

426
00:30:32.223 --> 00:30:33.719
I need time.

427
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.776
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

428
00:30:42.784 --> 00:30:45.400
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is, sir. He's conscious.

429
00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.073
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

430
00:30:54.788 --> 00:30:58.541
I love that smell.

431
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.212
I sure am going to miss it.

432
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.507
- Oracle.
- I know.

433
00:31:05.715 --> 00:31:06.883
I know.

434
00:31:07.092 --> 00:31:10.678
Sati, honey.

435
00:31:10.887 --> 00:31:13.223
Take a few cookies
and go with Seraph.

436
00:31:13.431 --> 00:31:16.142
Can I come back? I would
like to come back.

437
00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:21.231
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

438
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.402
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

439
00:31:47.507 --> 00:31:50.427
I'm scared, Seraph.

440
00:31:50.593 --> 00:31:53.972
Come.

441
00:32:35.597 --> 00:32:39.851
He's following us.

442
00:32:42.562 --> 00:32:45.517
Well, well, it's been a long time.

443
00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:51.070
I remember chasing you was
like chasing a ghost.

444
00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.323
I have beaten you before.

445
00:32:53.531 --> 00:32:55.230
Yes, true, but as you can see,

446
00:32:55.231 --> 00:32:57.600
things are a little different now.

447
00:32:59.913 --> 00:33:03.291
And you must be the last exile.

448
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.675
The Oracle told me about you.

449
00:33:05.676 --> 00:33:06.676
Really?

450
00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:09.339
What did she say about me?

451
00:33:09.547 --> 00:33:11.341
That you were a bad man.

452
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:17.722
Oh, I'm not so bad, once
you get to know me.

453
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.964
The great and powerful
Oracle, we meet at last.

454
00:33:52.382 --> 00:33:56.719
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

455
00:33:56.928 --> 00:33:59.489
The all-knowing Oracle
is never surprised.

456
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.600
How can she be? She
knows everything.

457
00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:05.375
But if that's true,
then why is she here

458
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:07.276
if she knew I was coming?

459
00:34:07.647 --> 00:34:09.692
Why wouldn't she leave?

460
00:34:15.238 --> 00:34:16.790
Maybe you knew I was
going to do that,

461
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:17.791
maybe you didn't.

462
00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:20.400
If you did, that means
you baked those cookies

463
00:34:20.401 --> 00:34:21.660
and set that plate right there,

464
00:34:21.661 --> 00:34:23.329
deliberately, purposefully.

465
00:34:23.538 --> 00:34:25.976
Which means that you're
sitting there also

466
00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:27.700
deliberately, purposefully.

467
00:34:28.585 --> 00:34:30.962
What did you do with Sati?

468
00:34:31.171 --> 00:34:37.218
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

469
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:39.846
You are a bastard.

470
00:34:40.054 --> 00:34:43.892
You would know, Mum.

471
00:34:46.644 --> 00:34:48.938
Do what you're here to do.

472
00:34:49.147 --> 00:34:52.609
Yes, madam.

473
00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:38.183
I really wish I could
help, but I just...

474
00:35:38.484 --> 00:35:40.084
I don't remember any of it.

475
00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:43.800
What about the cuts on your arms?

476
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:45.701
Those cuts are more
than one day old.

477
00:35:46.538 --> 00:35:49.082
Yeah, definitely.

478
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.876
You're right about that, sir.

479
00:35:52.085 --> 00:35:55.422
They look like they might
be self-inflicted.

480
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.843
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

481
00:36:00.051 --> 00:36:04.764
Unless, of course,
I wasn't myself.

482
00:36:04.973 --> 00:36:11.104
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

483
00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:16.840
Has this man been tested for VDTs?

484
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.410
Yes, sir. It was negative.

485
00:36:19.237 --> 00:36:22.365
But he is showing a lot of
unusual neural activity.

486
00:36:22.574 --> 00:36:24.130
Some cross-synaptic firing,

487
00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:26.100
as well as signs of recent trauma,

488
00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:30.081
with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

489
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.550
I want the truth. I don't
care what it takes.

490
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:33.851
Make him remember.

491
00:36:56.608 --> 00:36:58.142
Sir, we found her.

492
00:36:58.151 --> 00:36:59.400
- The "Logos"?
- Yes, sir.

493
00:36:59.402 --> 00:37:01.464
About time we got some
goddamn good news.

494
00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:35.396
Are the thermals picking
up any signs of life?

495
00:37:35.605 --> 00:37:37.450
No, sir. Nothing yet.

496
00:37:37.451 --> 00:37:38.660
What about the ship?

497
00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:40.761
Holographic says the
hull's still intact.

498
00:37:41.236 --> 00:37:43.250
Drop her down and keep a
man in the rear turret.

499
00:37:43.322 --> 00:37:44.364
Yes, sir.

500
00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:58.404
Get a full diagnostic on that
ship as fast as humanly possible.

501
00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:17.814
Careful, sir.

502
00:38:18.022 --> 00:38:21.378
The squids are sneaky
bastards. It could be a trap.

503
00:38:47.886 --> 00:38:49.006
What was that?

504
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.500
You can put that shit away, boys.

505
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:54.701
All she needs is a jump.

506
00:38:56.686 --> 00:39:01.149
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

507
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.880
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

508
00:39:05.912 --> 00:39:08.020
We didn't know what
happened after...

509
00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:13.912
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

510
00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.831
I'm happy to see you too.

511
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.875
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

512
00:39:19.083 --> 00:39:21.211
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

513
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.340
You saw her?

514
00:39:22.341 --> 00:39:24.200
Just before the
sentinels found us.

515
00:39:24.506 --> 00:39:25.800
What did she tell you?

516
00:39:25.801 --> 00:39:27.701
The same thing she always does.

517
00:39:29.928 --> 00:39:31.732
Exactly what I needed to hear.

518
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.310
In less than 12 hours,

519
00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:37.311
the machines will
breach the dock walls.

520
00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:39.150
Every simulation we've run,

521
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:41.900
we've seen that once the
machines are inside the city,

522
00:39:41.907 --> 00:39:44.651
the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

523
00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:47.561
Thus, our primary objective
must be to destroy

524
00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.490
or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

525
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.630
If we can do that,

526
00:39:51.631 --> 00:39:54.031
perhaps we can prevent them
from ever reaching the city.

527
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.450
If not, the only place

528
00:39:56.451 --> 00:39:58.360
we'll be able to mount
an effective defence

529
00:39:58.364 --> 00:40:00.542
will be at the entrance
of the temple.

530
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.461
It is small enough that it will
force them into a bottleneck,

531
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.923
allowing us to concentrate the
remainder of our defence.

532
00:40:07.132 --> 00:40:10.093
We understand that you've
requested additional volunteers.

533
00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:11.436
That is correct.

534
00:40:11.445 --> 00:40:14.400
Precisely what size of force
are you planning to commit

535
00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:16.301
to the primary dock objective?

536
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.894
Right now, the entire APU
Corps and half the infantry.

537
00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:21.876
Half the infantry?

538
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:23.310
If it were up to me, councillor...

539
00:40:23.314 --> 00:40:25.390
I'd take every man,
woman and child,

540
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:26.420
put a gun in their hand

541
00:40:26.421 --> 00:40:28.160
and march them straight
into that dock.

542
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.531
Perhaps it is best that
it is not up to you.

543
00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:33.783
Time will tell, councillor.

544
00:40:33.992 --> 00:40:36.619
Commander, just one more question.

545
00:40:36.828 --> 00:40:39.080
Has there been word from
the "Nebuchadnezzar"?

546
00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:41.609
None, and at this point
there's no reason to expect

547
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:42.710
that there ever will be.

548
00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:44.878
Perhaps.

549
00:40:45.086 --> 00:40:46.671
But we can hope.

550
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.580
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence

551
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:49.781
I don't have time for.

552
00:41:01.936 --> 00:41:04.856
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

553
00:41:05.064 --> 00:41:07.692
They're evacuating our
level. We have to go.

554
00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.528
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

555
00:41:10.737 --> 00:41:12.866
They've called for
volunteers to hold the dock.

556
00:41:17.744 --> 00:41:19.198
Kids, you stay here.

557
00:41:21.915 --> 00:41:24.292
I know how you feel, Zee,
but you can't do this.

558
00:41:24.501 --> 00:41:26.503
- I have to.
- Why?

559
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:29.339
Because I love him.

560
00:41:29.547 --> 00:41:31.883
I love him the same
as he loves me.

561
00:41:32.092 --> 00:41:33.565
And if I were out there
and he were here,

562
00:41:33.566 --> 00:41:34.566
I know what he'd do.

563
00:41:36.304 --> 00:41:38.000
But you're going to
get yourself killed.

564
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:40.001
It's crazy, Zee.

565
00:41:41.684 --> 00:41:43.188
Maybe it is.

566
00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:45.400
But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer,

567
00:41:45.401 --> 00:41:47.140
and you knew the only chance
you had to see him again

568
00:41:47.141 --> 00:41:50.100
was to hold the dock...
what would you do?

569
00:41:56.574 --> 00:42:00.078
Make shells.

570
00:42:09.337 --> 00:42:12.215
What the shit is
going on over here?

571
00:42:12.424 --> 00:42:15.885
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

572
00:42:16.094 --> 00:42:18.221
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

573
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.099
A unit volunteer, sir.

574
00:42:21.307 --> 00:42:23.830
What's a pod-born
pencil-neck like you

575
00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:25.431
doing volunteering for my Corps?

576
00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:30.400
I want to do my part, sir.
We got to hold the dock.

577
00:42:30.608 --> 00:42:32.790
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

578
00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:36.322
Should have said 16, I
might have believed that.

579
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:37.531
Okay, I'm 16.

580
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:38.950
Minimum age for the
Corps is eighteen.

581
00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:40.251
Sixteen's too young.

582
00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:43.420
The machines don't
care how old I am.

583
00:42:43.621 --> 00:42:45.421
They'll kill me just the same.

584
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.127
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

585
00:42:49.335 --> 00:42:53.173
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

586
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:56.750
You do, and you'll find
me and the machines

587
00:42:56.751 --> 00:42:58.051
have got something in common.

588
00:43:11.441 --> 00:43:13.228
Okay, charge the igniter.

589
00:43:20.283 --> 00:43:22.327
She lives again.

590
00:43:22.535 --> 00:43:23.755
You want us to patch an uplink

591
00:43:23.756 --> 00:43:25.556
to reload the operations
software, Sparky?

592
00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:26.957
Yeah, that'd be swell.

593
00:43:27.257 --> 00:43:29.751
You could clean the windscreen
while you're at it.

594
00:43:33.963 --> 00:43:36.508
Uplinks are in place, I'm
bringing her back online.

595
00:43:36.716 --> 00:43:38.770
Looking good, except...

596
00:43:41.304 --> 00:43:43.348
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

597
00:43:43.556 --> 00:43:45.026
No, there's not.

598
00:43:45.027 --> 00:43:46.527
You're looking at what
we're looking at.

599
00:43:46.735 --> 00:43:48.160
What the hell is
going on in there.

600
00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:50.061
Whatever it is, it can't be good.

601
00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:54.150
The machines have
taken Junction 21.

602
00:43:54.255 --> 00:43:55.255
The way I see it,

603
00:43:55.256 --> 00:43:57.600
if we drop down from
broadcast here,

604
00:43:57.654 --> 00:44:00.615
intersect 153, we
might surprise them.

605
00:44:00.824 --> 00:44:03.250
We go first, hammer
as deep as we can,

606
00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:04.551
and then blow our EMP.

607
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.283
Hopefully we can punch a hole big
enough for you to get through.

608
00:44:10.667 --> 00:44:11.805
It ain't pretty,

609
00:44:11.806 --> 00:44:14.206
but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

610
00:44:15.713 --> 00:44:17.173
No, it's not.

611
00:44:17.382 --> 00:44:20.385
There's another way.
A support line.

612
00:44:20.593 --> 00:44:24.431
It drops down right here,
1000 metres short of 21.

613
00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:26.555
If we're lucky, we may
be able to slip down

614
00:44:26.556 --> 00:44:27.656
without them ever knowing.

615
00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:30.870
That's a mechanical
line. It's impossible.

616
00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:33.189
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

617
00:44:33.398 --> 00:44:35.180
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

618
00:44:35.266 --> 00:44:37.183
That was a long time ago, Niobe.

619
00:44:37.784 --> 00:44:38.811
I said I can do it.

620
00:44:38.812 --> 00:44:39.812
So what?

621
00:44:39.813 --> 00:44:41.500
If you can, you'll be
the only one that can,

622
00:44:41.501 --> 00:44:43.367
there's no way we can follow you.

623
00:44:46.244 --> 00:44:49.289
Hi.

624
00:44:49.497 --> 00:44:51.343
I know time is always against us.

625
00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:53.100
I'm sorry that I took so long.

626
00:44:54.252 --> 00:44:58.006
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

627
00:44:58.214 --> 00:45:00.300
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

628
00:45:00.508 --> 00:45:02.000
There's no easy way to say this,

629
00:45:02.001 --> 00:45:03.001
so I'll just say it.

630
00:45:03.887 --> 00:45:05.614
I have to take one of the ships.

631
00:45:05.615 --> 00:45:06.615
What?

632
00:45:06.723 --> 00:45:09.184
To go where?

633
00:45:09.392 --> 00:45:12.228
To the machine city.

634
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.484
I know it's difficult
to understand.

635
00:45:17.692 --> 00:45:20.361
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

636
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:21.705
I still have to go.

637
00:45:21.713 --> 00:45:22.713
You'll never make it.

638
00:45:22.714 --> 00:45:25.520
In 100 years no ship has been
within 100 kilometres of it.

639
00:45:25.521 --> 00:45:28.119
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

640
00:45:28.328 --> 00:45:30.148
Is this what The
Oracle has told you?

641
00:45:30.649 --> 00:45:31.649
No.

642
00:45:31.956 --> 00:45:34.520
This is asinine. If you
want to kill yourself,

643
00:45:34.521 --> 00:45:37.221
go do it, but do it without
wasting one of our ships.

644
00:45:37.295 --> 00:45:39.213
You have to believe
me. I have to go.

645
00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:40.214
Bullshit.

646
00:45:40.381 --> 00:45:43.551
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go.

647
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.125
And believe me, this ship
will go to hell long before

648
00:45:46.126 --> 00:45:48.223
I let you take it anywhere.

649
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:56.106
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

650
00:45:56.314 --> 00:45:57.934
Don't even think of
trying to tell me

651
00:45:57.935 --> 00:46:00.575
what I can or cannot
do with my ship

652
00:46:00.576 --> 00:46:01.860
after that little speech.

653
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:04.816
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship,

654
00:46:05.017 --> 00:46:06.117
he can take mine.

655
00:46:06.825 --> 00:46:08.000
If we leave inside the hour,

656
00:46:08.001 --> 00:46:10.201
we should reach Zion
as the machines do.

657
00:46:10.578 --> 00:46:13.123
That's as good a plan as any.

658
00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:18.503
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

659
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:25.760
Two ships, two directions.

660
00:46:25.969 --> 00:46:29.597
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

661
00:46:29.806 --> 00:46:31.570
You've never believed in the One.

662
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:32.871
I still don't.

663
00:46:33.143 --> 00:46:36.271
Then why are you doing this?

664
00:46:36.438 --> 00:46:39.482
I believe in him.

665
00:46:39.858 --> 00:46:43.361
Thank you.

666
00:46:46.823 --> 00:46:49.784
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

667
00:46:49.993 --> 00:46:53.288
To make it easier for
you to remember.

668
00:46:53.496 --> 00:46:56.499
What if I don't want to remember?

669
00:46:56.708 --> 00:46:58.752
Why would you want that?

670
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.839
What if I blew that EMP?

671
00:47:03.047 --> 00:47:05.250
What if I did destroy those ships,

672
00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:09.000
and I am responsible for the
deaths of all those men?

673
00:47:12.015 --> 00:47:13.734
If I did that...

674
00:47:15.143 --> 00:47:20.356
it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

675
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:34.496
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

676
00:47:40.877 --> 00:47:43.922
I'm ready.

677
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.883
Trinity...

678
00:47:47.092 --> 00:47:51.179
There's something I have to say.

679
00:47:52.806 --> 00:47:56.601
Something you need to understand.

680
00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.646
I know I'm supposed to go.

681
00:47:59.854 --> 00:48:02.857
But beyond that,

682
00:48:03.066 --> 00:48:05.485
I don't know. I...

683
00:48:05.693 --> 00:48:11.074
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

684
00:48:11.407 --> 00:48:13.912
I knew it the moment you
said you had to leave.

685
00:48:14.213 --> 00:48:15.513
I could see it in your face.

686
00:48:16.621 --> 00:48:19.415
Just like you knew the
moment you looked at me,

687
00:48:19.416 --> 00:48:21.793
that I was coming with you.

688
00:48:23.795 --> 00:48:25.588
I'm scared, Trin.

689
00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:28.383
So am I.

690
00:48:28.591 --> 00:48:33.012
It took me ten minutes
to buckle up one boot.

691
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:35.265
But I'll tell you something.

692
00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:38.435
Six hours ago, I told
the Merovingian,

693
00:48:38.643 --> 00:48:43.064
I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

694
00:48:44.149 --> 00:48:46.693
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

695
00:48:46.901 --> 00:48:48.945
No.

696
00:48:49.154 --> 00:48:51.781
Nothing.

697
00:49:03.626 --> 00:49:05.090
Get finished loading
that ammunition.

698
00:49:05.091 --> 00:49:06.091
Just about, sir.

699
00:49:06.129 --> 00:49:08.423
Let's move it. We are out of time.

700
00:49:08.631 --> 00:49:10.925
You're not leaving them anything?

701
00:49:11.134 --> 00:49:14.721
He said he didn't need it.

702
00:49:17.182 --> 00:49:20.810
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

703
00:49:21.019 --> 00:49:24.314
Thank you.

704
00:49:27.692 --> 00:49:30.570
I can only hope you
know what you're doing.

705
00:49:30.779 --> 00:49:33.656
Me too.

706
00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:39.454
It was an honour, sir.

707
00:49:42.207 --> 00:49:45.752
No, the honour is still mine.

708
00:49:58.223 --> 00:49:59.468
We're ready, sir.

709
00:49:59.569 --> 00:50:00.969
About damn time.

710
00:50:02.477 --> 00:50:07.524
We're already late, captain, so
let's hit it and hit it hard.

711
00:50:09.776 --> 00:50:11.653
Bye, baby.

712
00:50:11.861 --> 00:50:15.156
Take good care of them.

713
00:50:35.552 --> 00:50:38.805
Ready?

714
00:50:45.103 --> 00:50:47.105
Engine's still firing.

715
00:50:47.313 --> 00:50:49.001
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

716
00:51:04.038 --> 00:51:06.717
I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

717
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:07.718
Bane?

718
00:51:07.876 --> 00:51:10.962
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

719
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:13.131
Every single time, I
thought it was the last.

720
00:51:13.339 --> 00:51:14.875
Every time, I was sure we had you,

721
00:51:14.876 --> 00:51:17.342
but somehow you'd slip
through our fingers.

722
00:51:17.343 --> 00:51:22.432
I really can't express just
how aggravating that can be.

723
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.268
What are you talking about?

724
00:51:25.477 --> 00:51:32.150
I think I might enjoy killing
you as much as killing him.

725
00:51:46.748 --> 00:51:50.460
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic.

726
00:51:50.668 --> 00:51:52.514
You're going to pay for that.

727
00:51:54.422 --> 00:51:56.030
Twenty-seven kilometres to go.

728
00:51:56.082 --> 00:51:57.509
Captain, we've got an
emergency down here.

729
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:59.462
- What is it, AK?
- It's Maggie, sir.

730
00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.475
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.

731
00:52:02.514 --> 00:52:03.676
Goddamn it.

732
00:52:06.935 --> 00:52:10.313
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

733
00:52:10.522 --> 00:52:12.273
He fired that EMP.

734
00:52:12.282 --> 00:52:16.111
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

735
00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:18.110
We searched the whole
ship, captain.

736
00:52:18.311 --> 00:52:19.311
He ain't here.

737
00:52:20.907 --> 00:52:24.702
- I know where he is.
- The "Logos".

738
00:52:24.869 --> 00:52:26.621
- We got to go back.
- Too late.

739
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.473
You don't know that. What
if they need our help?

740
00:52:28.873 --> 00:52:30.083
- It's too dangerous.
- Why?

741
00:52:30.084 --> 00:52:33.420
Because if he's killed them
he'll control another EMP.

742
00:52:35.088 --> 00:52:37.027
At this point, they're
on their own.

743
00:52:37.528 --> 00:52:38.628
Just like us.

744
00:52:40.552 --> 00:52:42.887
Mr Anderson.

745
00:52:43.096 --> 00:52:45.450
I see you are as
predictable in this world

746
00:52:45.451 --> 00:52:46.751
as you are in the other.

747
00:52:47.517 --> 00:52:49.018
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

748
00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:50.447
It might appear that way to you.

749
00:52:50.448 --> 00:52:54.100
But Mr Anderson and I know that
appearances can be deceiving.

750
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.195
Confused, Mr Anderson? It'll
all become clear in a moment.

751
00:52:59.404 --> 00:53:01.352
Now, thank you for
bringing me the gun.

752
00:53:01.353 --> 00:53:02.813
You can set it down right there.

753
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.784
Don't do it.

754
00:53:04.793 --> 00:53:07.850
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot.

755
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.410
Fry us. Burn us alive.

756
00:53:09.414 --> 00:53:11.985
Do it. If you don't,
he'll kill us both.

757
00:53:13.793 --> 00:53:17.839
Look at him. He knows he
should do it, but he won't.

758
00:53:18.047 --> 00:53:22.510
- He can't.
- Do it.

759
00:53:28.641 --> 00:53:33.563
Back away from the
gun and turn around.

760
00:53:39.194 --> 00:53:41.863
Let her go.

761
00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:56.628
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

762
00:53:56.836 --> 00:54:00.924
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

763
00:54:01.132 --> 00:54:04.521
I do. I think of nothing else.

764
00:54:09.307 --> 00:54:13.436
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognise me?

765
00:54:13.645 --> 00:54:15.877
I admit, it is difficult
to even think

766
00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:18.108
encased in this rotting
piece of meat.

767
00:54:18.316 --> 00:54:22.216
The stink of it
filling every breath,

768
00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:26.116
a suffocating cloud
you can't escape.

769
00:54:26.783 --> 00:54:28.660
Disgusting.

770
00:54:28.868 --> 00:54:31.355
Look at how pathetically
fragile it is.

771
00:54:31.356 --> 00:54:34.300
Nothing this weak is
meant to survive.

772
00:54:39.963 --> 00:54:44.759
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

773
00:54:46.386 --> 00:54:50.765
Yes. That's it, Mr Anderson.

774
00:54:50.974 --> 00:54:52.892
Look past the flesh.

775
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:56.620
Look through the soft gelatin
of these dull cow eyes

776
00:54:56.621 --> 00:54:58.550
and see your enemy.

777
00:55:00.525 --> 00:55:03.653
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr Anderson.

778
00:55:03.862 --> 00:55:05.050
It can't be.

779
00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:09.051
There's nowhere I can't go. There
is nowhere I won't find you.

780
00:55:09.993 --> 00:55:14.414
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

781
00:55:14.622 --> 00:55:17.625
Inevitable.

782
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:19.961
Goodbye, Mr Anderson.

783
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:23.298
This is it. It's got to be.

784
00:56:07.383 --> 00:56:10.011
Oh, no.

785
00:56:26.736 --> 00:56:29.975
I wish you could see
yourself, Mr Anderson.

786
00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.790
Blind messiah.

787
00:56:41.626 --> 00:56:44.981
You're a symbol for all of
your kind, Mr Anderson.

788
00:56:47.799 --> 00:56:51.386
Helpless.

789
00:56:52.262 --> 00:56:55.932
Pathetic.

790
00:56:57.392 --> 00:57:03.064
Just waiting to be put
out of your misery.

791
00:57:06.985 --> 00:57:08.363
I can see you.

792
00:57:17.287 --> 00:57:20.039
It's not over, Mr Anderson.

793
00:57:20.248 --> 00:57:23.626
It's not over.

794
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.518
- Trinity.
- Neo.

795
00:57:40.643 --> 00:57:43.521
Neo.

796
00:57:45.023 --> 00:57:48.193
Oh, no. Your eyes.

797
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.654
I'll be okay.

798
00:57:51.863 --> 00:57:53.033
It's all right, Trin.

799
00:57:55.784 --> 00:58:00.163
But I think you're going
to have to drive.

800
00:58:05.251 --> 00:58:08.338
Seismic's projecting
22 minutes to breach.

801
00:58:08.546 --> 00:58:10.448
They can't know we
don't have an EMP.

802
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:12.342
They'll have to attack in waves.

803
00:58:12.425 --> 00:58:14.676
Concentrate our offence
on the diggers.

804
00:58:14.677 --> 00:58:16.971
Order the APUs into position.

805
00:58:17.263 --> 00:58:20.183
Yes, sir.

806
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.441
Come on, move.

807
00:59:23.455 --> 00:59:25.081
All right.

808
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.083
This is it.

809
00:59:27.292 --> 00:59:28.422
Now, you all know me,

810
00:59:28.423 --> 00:59:31.700
so I'll just say this
as simple as I can.

811
00:59:33.131 --> 00:59:36.926
If it's our time to
die, it's our time.

812
00:59:37.135 --> 00:59:42.599
All I ask is, if we have to
give these bastards our lives,

813
00:59:42.807 --> 00:59:45.685
we give them hell before we do.

814
01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:06.331
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

815
01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:08.583
But I'll make you a deal.

816
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:13.254
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

817
01:00:14.005 --> 01:00:17.383
Deal.

818
01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:27.832
Holy Christ, would
you look at that.

819
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:28.833
Quiet.

820
01:00:28.853 --> 01:00:31.773
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometres.

821
01:00:31.981 --> 01:00:34.366
We're still generating
too hot a field.

822
01:00:34.367 --> 01:00:36.267
Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

823
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:39.000
Give me full manual.
Drop down four pads.

824
01:00:39.297 --> 01:00:40.740
It'll bottom out.

825
01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:55.422
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred metres.

826
01:00:56.464 --> 01:00:58.935
If we can just get close enough...

827
01:01:03.638 --> 01:01:05.849
Six hundred metres.

828
01:01:06.057 --> 01:01:09.227
There.

829
01:01:15.316 --> 01:01:16.316
Shit.

830
01:01:19.237 --> 01:01:20.245
Jig's up, here they come.

831
01:01:20.246 --> 01:01:21.626
Give me full power, full systems.

832
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.150
Man the gun turrets, every
goddamn one of them. Go, go.

833
01:01:24.426 --> 01:01:26.645
Ghost, you're the best gunner
we have, go with them.

834
01:01:27.045 --> 01:01:28.722
Morpheus, take his place.

835
01:01:45.889 --> 01:01:49.809
I'm coming, baby.

836
01:01:57.192 --> 01:01:58.312
Here they come.

837
01:02:03.406 --> 01:02:05.095
Slow down, this ain't the "Logos".

838
01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.220
Hang on to your lunch,
Roland, here we go.

839
01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:19.540
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

840
01:03:11.182 --> 01:03:13.085
Breach. The dock is breached.

841
01:03:33.705 --> 01:03:37.208
Knuckle up.

842
01:03:49.053 --> 01:03:52.140
For Zion.

843
01:05:58.808 --> 01:05:59.808
Shit.

844
01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:08.902
Come on, let's go.

845
01:06:13.198 --> 01:06:14.376
Knuckle up.

846
01:06:29.714 --> 01:06:30.950
Reload.

847
01:06:32.842 --> 01:06:34.621
Reload nine.

848
01:06:41.518 --> 01:06:44.187
Go, go. Move, move.

849
01:06:55.073 --> 01:06:56.100
Watch your left.

850
01:06:57.867 --> 01:06:59.338
Don't let them through.

851
01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:04.039
Zuka.

852
01:07:41.578 --> 01:07:44.831
Oh, my god.

853
01:07:57.051 --> 01:07:58.378
Where the hell's my infantry?

854
01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.581
I want that goddamn
machine taken down.

855
01:08:34.589 --> 01:08:37.258
Dig this.

856
01:08:40.095 --> 01:08:41.464
Oh, shit.

857
01:09:02.075 --> 01:09:04.329
- Bogey two at the breach point.
- Goddamn it.

858
01:09:30.395 --> 01:09:34.023
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

859
01:09:41.865 --> 01:09:42.910
Keep them off me.

860
01:09:42.911 --> 01:09:45.011
Christ, there's a
shitstorm of them.

861
01:10:16.962 --> 01:10:17.962
Captain, you see that?

862
01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:19.463
They're after the
radio. Stop them.

863
01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:28.786
Damn it.

864
01:10:53.853 --> 01:10:56.773
Yeah.

865
01:11:07.033 --> 01:11:10.370
Grab my belt.

866
01:11:19.337 --> 01:11:22.257
Just give me one clean shot.

867
01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:30.223
Damn it.

868
01:11:51.536 --> 01:11:54.622
Charra.

869
01:11:58.126 --> 01:12:00.760
- Commander Lock, I got incoming.
- We got a dock full of incoming.

870
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:02.360
Sir, yes, sir. But this
is different, sir.

871
01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:03.361
What?

872
01:12:04.048 --> 01:12:05.759
I think it's one of ours, sir.

873
01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:07.040
That's impossible.

874
01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:08.541
Holographics are
trying to confirm sir.

875
01:12:09.095 --> 01:12:10.805
Contact them. I want access codes.

876
01:12:11.014 --> 01:12:12.684
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

877
01:12:14.893 --> 01:12:17.562
It's a trick. That's not
one of ours, it can't be.

878
01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:21.526
That's a mechanical line. No
one can pilot mechanical.

879
01:12:31.868 --> 01:12:33.480
Forward aft, 30 degrees
at 80 percent.

880
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:34.881
Thirty degrees, 80.

881
01:12:38.124 --> 01:12:39.480
Lower starboard 60 degrees,

882
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:40.581
- 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

883
01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:48.510
- Shit. Come on, keep up.
- I'm trying.

884
01:13:06.945 --> 01:13:09.989
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the "Hammer", sir.

885
01:13:10.198 --> 01:13:11.491
How can that be?

886
01:13:11.699 --> 01:13:13.660
The ship is under attack,
sustaining heavy damage.

887
01:13:13.868 --> 01:13:16.621
But at its present velocity, it'll
reach Gate 3 in 12 minutes.

888
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.874
Sir their EMP could take out
every sentinel out there.

889
01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:21.385
It'd take out more than that.

890
01:13:21.435 --> 01:13:23.270
It'll wipe out our
entire defence system.

891
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:26.256
We blow an EMP inside,
then we lose the dock.

892
01:13:26.464 --> 01:13:29.843
Sir, we already lost the dock.

893
01:13:32.637 --> 01:13:35.348
Open the gate.

894
01:13:35.482 --> 01:13:37.030
Gate 3 is not responding.

895
01:13:37.031 --> 01:13:38.831
We've taken critical damage, sir.

896
01:13:40.103 --> 01:13:42.373
We've lost control.
We can't open it.

897
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:53.490
There's the exit.

898
01:13:53.658 --> 01:13:54.658
On my mark,

899
01:13:54.659 --> 01:13:56.829
give me full power 90 degrees
to lower-left starboard.

900
01:13:57.537 --> 01:13:59.497
Full power,

901
01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:00.975
ninety degrees.

902
01:14:07.172 --> 01:14:08.172
Now.

903
01:14:15.972 --> 01:14:19.476
Hold on, baby.

904
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:24.481
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

905
01:14:24.689 --> 01:14:28.151
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

906
01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.080
Sentinels are inside the dock.

907
01:14:32.363 --> 01:14:33.533
Are we too late?

908
01:15:03.061 --> 01:15:05.772
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

909
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:09.442
Get me the one closest to Gate 3.

910
01:15:36.553 --> 01:15:37.720
Reload.

911
01:15:37.929 --> 01:15:40.640
He's pissing metal.

912
01:15:42.642 --> 01:15:45.645
Go.

913
01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.494
Go.

914
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:25.143
Heads up. They're coming around.

915
01:16:36.454 --> 01:16:37.599
Behind you.

916
01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:52.931
It's jammed.

917
01:16:59.344 --> 01:17:01.672
Forget it, kid. Get out of here.

918
01:17:03.181 --> 01:17:05.107
Got it.

919
01:17:33.378 --> 01:17:36.673
Captain Mifune.

920
01:17:38.383 --> 01:17:40.635
Oh, no.

921
01:17:40.844 --> 01:17:43.555
They're coming.

922
01:17:44.389 --> 01:17:47.225
They're coming.

923
01:17:47.434 --> 01:17:49.018
The "Hammer".

924
01:17:49.227 --> 01:17:50.812
What?

925
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:54.357
You have to open that gate.

926
01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:57.694
Cut the counterweights.

927
01:17:58.403 --> 01:18:00.405
You can do it.

928
01:18:00.613 --> 01:18:04.200
Hurry. There's no time.

929
01:18:04.409 --> 01:18:06.035
Captain...

930
01:18:06.244 --> 01:18:10.039
I didn't finish the
training program.

931
01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:15.044
Neither did I.

932
01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.318
- Lock that down.
- Kill the feeder.

933
01:18:38.526 --> 01:18:41.613
We won't make it. We got
to blow the EMP now.

934
01:18:41.821 --> 01:18:46.367
Come on, someone, please.

935
01:18:59.514 --> 01:19:00.750
Keep the weight forward.

936
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.721
Light as a feather, as a feather.

937
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:11.070
Commander, holographic reports

938
01:19:11.071 --> 01:19:13.371
Captain Mifune's APU is
up and moving to Gate 3.

939
01:19:19.692 --> 01:19:21.296
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

940
01:19:32.497 --> 01:19:34.457
Captain Mifune's APU
just reached Gate 3.

941
01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:36.661
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

942
01:19:38.169 --> 01:19:41.923
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

943
01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:44.500
Mifune... this is Lock.

944
01:19:45.593 --> 01:19:48.430
I don't know if you can
hear me, but if you can...

945
01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:51.349
the Hammer's two minutes away.

946
01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:55.230
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.

947
01:19:57.355 --> 01:19:59.107
Link.

948
01:19:59.315 --> 01:20:01.474
Get to the main deck.
Charge the EMP.

949
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:39.229
Do it, kid.

950
01:20:43.902 --> 01:20:46.181
Neo. I believe.

951
01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:59.042
- Yes.
- Can we make it?

952
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.712
We ain't come this far?

953
01:21:13.431 --> 01:21:15.885
Almost home, almost home.

954
01:21:35.161 --> 01:21:36.161
Burn it, Link.

955
01:22:00.937 --> 01:22:03.940
- You did it.
- No.

956
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:05.751
We did it.

957
01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.654
You're a hell of a pilot.

958
01:22:10.905 --> 01:22:14.284
Some things in this
world never change.

959
01:22:14.492 --> 01:22:15.970
But some things do?

960
01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:19.164
Luckily...

961
01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:22.709
some things do.

962
01:22:33.011 --> 01:22:34.721
Link.

963
01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:38.016
- Zee? Zee.
- Link.

964
01:22:43.563 --> 01:22:46.900
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

965
01:22:47.108 --> 01:22:50.570
I made a promise.

966
01:22:57.869 --> 01:23:00.747
You did wear it.

967
01:23:01.122 --> 01:23:06.002
Are you kidding? I'm never
going to take it off.

968
01:23:14.219 --> 01:23:16.262
Three captains, one ship.

969
01:23:16.471 --> 01:23:17.893
I assume the other ships were lost

970
01:23:17.894 --> 01:23:20.030
under equally pointless
circumstances.

971
01:23:20.642 --> 01:23:22.227
It's good to see you too, Jason.

972
01:23:22.435 --> 01:23:24.450
The Council's waiting to
hear your explanation.

973
01:23:24.451 --> 01:23:26.040
You forgive me for not attending,

974
01:23:26.041 --> 01:23:28.241
but I have to try to
salvage this debacle.

975
01:23:29.818 --> 01:23:30.980
Did I miss something Commander?

976
01:23:30.981 --> 01:23:32.320
I thought we just saved the dock.

977
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:34.406
That's the problem
with you people.

978
01:23:34.614 --> 01:23:37.283
You can't think for five
minutes in front of your face.

979
01:23:37.492 --> 01:23:39.640
That EMP knocked out almost
every piece of hardware

980
01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:40.641
and every APU.

981
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
If I were the machines,

982
01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:44.001
I'd send every sentinel
I had here right now.

983
01:23:44.499 --> 01:23:46.166
Saved the dock, captain?

984
01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:48.461
You just handed it to
them on a silver platter.

985
01:23:53.883 --> 01:23:55.045
Come on, get it cut.

986
01:23:57.595 --> 01:23:58.865
The bridge is clear.

987
01:24:01.307 --> 01:24:02.527
Do you hear that?

988
01:24:05.603 --> 01:24:07.105
Get that cable run.

989
01:24:07.313 --> 01:24:08.982
I want the system back online.

990
01:24:09.023 --> 01:24:11.609
Commander, it's the dock.
We've got incoming.

991
01:24:12.444 --> 01:24:14.779
Order everyone to fall back.

992
01:24:14.988 --> 01:24:18.241
Seal the shaft. Now.

993
01:24:18.450 --> 01:24:19.450
Move it.

994
01:24:23.538 --> 01:24:25.641
Oh, my god.

995
01:24:33.298 --> 01:24:35.425
- All clear.
- Do it.

996
01:24:35.633 --> 01:24:39.304
- Go. Come on. Run.
- Go.

997
01:24:54.152 --> 01:24:56.654
Your move.

998
01:24:56.863 --> 01:24:58.865
So you gave them your ship?

999
01:24:59.074 --> 01:25:00.715
That is correct,
councillor, I did.

1000
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.116
Knowing what he planned
to do with it?

1001
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:07.457
And The Oracle said
nothing of this?

1002
01:25:07.665 --> 01:25:09.555
She told me that Neo
would need my help,

1003
01:25:09.556 --> 01:25:12.245
and when the time came I would
choose to help him or not.

1004
01:25:12.545 --> 01:25:15.166
But what hope can a
single vessel have

1005
01:25:15.167 --> 01:25:17.067
against their entire
defence system?

1006
01:25:17.175 --> 01:25:20.345
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

1007
01:25:20.553 --> 01:25:22.540
He wouldn't even
take any ammunition.

1008
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.783
He was totally out
of his goddamn mind.

1009
01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:29.270
No, he wasn't.

1010
01:25:29.687 --> 01:25:33.566
Neo is doing what he
believes he must do.

1011
01:25:33.775 --> 01:25:35.586
I don't know if what
he's doing is right.

1012
01:25:35.587 --> 01:25:36.587
I don't know...

1013
01:25:37.195 --> 01:25:39.781
if he'll reach the machine city.

1014
01:25:39.989 --> 01:25:44.369
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

1015
01:25:44.577 --> 01:25:46.100
But I do know that

1016
01:25:46.101 --> 01:25:48.601
as long as there is a
single breath in his body,

1017
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:53.837
he will not give up.

1018
01:25:54.045 --> 01:25:57.048
And neither can we.

1019
01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:03.248
Temperature's dropping.

1020
01:26:07.016 --> 01:26:08.016
Here we go.

1021
01:26:47.807 --> 01:26:50.727
We're over the fields, aren't we?

1022
01:26:50.935 --> 01:26:52.812
How do you know that?

1023
01:26:53.021 --> 01:26:56.399
I can feel them.

1024
01:27:03.615 --> 01:27:05.867
Over there.

1025
01:27:06.076 --> 01:27:08.520
There's our path. Can you see it?

1026
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:09.900
Three lines.

1027
01:27:10.163 --> 01:27:12.248
Power lines.

1028
01:27:12.457 --> 01:27:15.668
Follow them.

1029
01:27:31.142 --> 01:27:32.977
What are they doing?

1030
01:27:33.186 --> 01:27:35.605
I don't know.

1031
01:27:35.814 --> 01:27:38.233
Lieutenant?

1032
01:27:52.831 --> 01:27:54.416
Goddamn it.

1033
01:27:54.624 --> 01:27:57.293
What do we do now, Commander?

1034
01:28:00.547 --> 01:28:03.133
It is now a matter of time.

1035
01:28:03.341 --> 01:28:06.970
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

1036
01:28:07.178 --> 01:28:08.655
I recommend that the Council join

1037
01:28:08.656 --> 01:28:12.267
the rest of the non-military
personnel inside the Temple.

1038
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.935
How long do we have?

1039
01:28:14.144 --> 01:28:18.314
Two hours. Maybe less.

1040
01:28:18.648 --> 01:28:20.530
My men have begun
fortifying the entrance

1041
01:28:20.531 --> 01:28:23.236
with enough artillery
to make our last stand.

1042
01:28:24.738 --> 01:28:27.532
Beyond that, there isn't
anything more I can do.

1043
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:30.030
Commander, do you think
that we have any chance...

1044
01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:31.031
of surviving?

1045
01:28:32.732 --> 01:28:33.732
If I were you Councillor,

1046
01:28:33.733 --> 01:28:35.433
I wouldn't ask me that question.

1047
01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.543
I would ask him.

1048
01:28:38.752 --> 01:28:39.835
Why?

1049
01:28:39.836 --> 01:28:43.047
Because he's the one who
believes in miracles.

1050
01:28:49.679 --> 01:28:52.932
There. Those mountains.

1051
01:28:53.141 --> 01:28:55.643
That's it.

1052
01:28:58.354 --> 01:29:00.523
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

1053
01:29:00.732 --> 01:29:03.359
If you tell me we'll make
it, I'll believe you.

1054
01:29:03.568 --> 01:29:06.654
We'll make it.

1055
01:29:08.198 --> 01:29:11.367
We have to.

1056
01:30:23.273 --> 01:30:26.401
Sentinels.

1057
01:30:36.253 --> 01:30:37.505
There's too many.

1058
01:30:54.129 --> 01:30:56.264
Gotcha.

1059
01:30:56.473 --> 01:30:57.741
Come on, Neo, I need help here.

1060
01:30:57.742 --> 01:30:58.742
I can't beat them.

1061
01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:01.269
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

1062
01:31:01.478 --> 01:31:05.899
- What?
- The sky. It's the only way.

1063
01:31:06.441 --> 01:31:07.441
Then up we go.

1064
01:31:43.436 --> 01:31:46.773
Beautiful.

1065
01:32:07.168 --> 01:32:11.214
Pump the igniter. The
ship will start.

1066
01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:21.141
Again. Slowly.

1067
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.227
Now.

1068
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:50.669
Trin?

1069
01:32:53.256 --> 01:32:55.325
Trinity?

1070
01:32:56.134 --> 01:32:57.820
Trinity?

1071
01:32:58.928 --> 01:33:01.014
- I'm here.
- Where?

1072
01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:03.892
Here.

1073
01:33:12.984 --> 01:33:15.612
We made it.

1074
01:33:15.862 --> 01:33:19.240
You said we would.

1075
01:33:20.075 --> 01:33:23.286
It's unbelievable, Trin.

1076
01:33:23.495 --> 01:33:25.288
Light everywhere.

1077
01:33:25.497 --> 01:33:28.833
Like the whole thing
was built of light.

1078
01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:32.670
I wish you could see what I see.

1079
01:33:32.879 --> 01:33:36.299
You've already shown me so much.

1080
01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:41.638
What is it, Trinity? What's wrong?

1081
01:33:41.846 --> 01:33:45.767
I can't go with you, Neo.

1082
01:33:46.017 --> 01:33:47.977
I've gone as far as I can.

1083
01:33:48.186 --> 01:33:49.497
What?

1084
01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:53.200
Oh, no.

1085
01:33:54.776 --> 01:33:57.028
Oh, no. No, no.

1086
01:33:57.237 --> 01:34:00.322
It's all right.

1087
01:34:00.323 --> 01:34:03.284
It's time.

1088
01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:06.955
I've done all that I could do.

1089
01:34:07.163 --> 01:34:10.083
Now you have to do the rest.

1090
01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:12.502
You have to finish it.

1091
01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:15.171
You have to save Zion.

1092
01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:17.298
I can't.

1093
01:34:17.507 --> 01:34:21.177
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

1094
01:34:21.386 --> 01:34:23.930
You will.

1095
01:34:24.139 --> 01:34:28.726
I believe it. I always have.

1096
01:34:29.728 --> 01:34:32.814
Trinity.

1097
01:34:33.648 --> 01:34:38.528
Trinity, you can't die.

1098
01:34:39.154 --> 01:34:41.322
You can't.

1099
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:43.074
You can't.

1100
01:34:43.283 --> 01:34:46.870
Yes, I can.

1101
01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:52.500
You brought me back once.

1102
01:34:53.251 --> 01:34:56.796
But not this time.

1103
01:35:01.176 --> 01:35:04.554
Do you remember,

1104
01:35:04.888 --> 01:35:09.267
on that roof, after you caught me,

1105
01:35:09.392 --> 01:35:12.645
the last thing I said to you?

1106
01:35:13.938 --> 01:35:16.566
You said, "I'm sorry".

1107
01:35:16.775 --> 01:35:20.361
I wish I hadn't.

1108
01:35:21.946 --> 01:35:25.700
That was my last thought.

1109
01:35:26.659 --> 01:35:30.205
I wished I had one more chance

1110
01:35:30.413 --> 01:35:34.084
to say what really mattered.

1111
01:35:35.251 --> 01:35:39.506
To say how much I loved you.

1112
01:35:40.465 --> 01:35:45.303
How grateful I was for every
moment I was with you.

1113
01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:49.361
But by the time I knew how
to say what I wanted to,

1114
01:35:49.362 --> 01:35:50.762
it was too late.

1115
01:35:57.649 --> 01:36:01.611
But you brought me back.

1116
01:36:03.029 --> 01:36:06.741
You gave me my wish.

1117
01:36:08.618 --> 01:36:14.082
One more chance to say what
I really wanted to say.

1118
01:36:17.335 --> 01:36:20.672
Kiss me.

1119
01:36:22.173 --> 01:36:25.427
Once more,

1120
01:36:25.677 --> 01:36:28.513
kiss me.

1121
01:36:54.497 --> 01:36:55.920
Get that ammunition
where it belongs.

1122
01:36:55.921 --> 01:36:57.421
You got one chance
to get this right.

1123
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:02.464
Get that damn thing mounted.

1124
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:10.013
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1125
01:37:23.485 --> 01:37:24.944
Neo...

1126
01:37:25.153 --> 01:37:29.032
If you're going to do something,
you better do it quick.

1127
01:39:36.367 --> 01:39:38.411
I only ask to say what
I've come to say.

1128
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:41.517
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try to stop you.

1129
01:39:46.711 --> 01:39:48.463
Speak.

1130
01:39:48.671 --> 01:39:51.591
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

1131
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.315
Soon he will spread
through this city

1132
01:39:53.316 --> 01:39:54.816
as he spread through the Matrix.

1133
01:39:55.386 --> 01:39:58.139
You can not stop him.

1134
01:39:58.848 --> 01:40:01.976
- But I can.
- We don't need you.

1135
01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:05.355
We need nothing.

1136
01:40:05.563 --> 01:40:07.265
If that's true, then
I've made a mistake,

1137
01:40:07.266 --> 01:40:08.666
and you should kill me now.

1138
01:40:14.572 --> 01:40:17.700
What do you want?

1139
01:40:17.909 --> 01:40:20.620
Peace.

1140
01:40:44.978 --> 01:40:48.398
What are they doing?

1141
01:40:52.485 --> 01:40:55.947
What are you doing?

1142
01:40:57.657 --> 01:41:01.077
Morpheus.

1143
01:41:23.933 --> 01:41:27.395
And if you fail?

1144
01:41:28.146 --> 01:41:31.608
I won't.

1145
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:53.171
Neo.

1146
01:41:53.379 --> 01:41:54.500
He fights for us.

1147
01:42:36.756 --> 01:42:39.634
Mr Anderson, welcome back.

1148
01:42:39.843 --> 01:42:43.430
We missed you.

1149
01:42:46.099 --> 01:42:49.394
You like what I've
done with the place?

1150
01:42:49.602 --> 01:42:52.063
It ends tonight.

1151
01:42:52.272 --> 01:42:55.233
I know it does. I've seen it.

1152
01:42:55.442 --> 01:42:59.195
That's why the rest of me is
just going to enjoy the show,

1153
01:42:59.204 --> 01:43:04.409
because we already know that
I'm the one that beats you.

1154
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:58.189
Can you feel it, Mr Anderson,

1155
01:44:58.398 --> 01:45:00.734
closing in on you?

1156
01:45:00.942 --> 01:45:04.237
Oh, I can.

1157
01:45:04.446 --> 01:45:08.533
I really should thank you for
it. After all, it was your life

1158
01:45:08.542 --> 01:45:12.579
that taught me the
purpose of all life.

1159
01:45:12.787 --> 01:45:17.751
The purpose of life is to end.

1160
01:48:52.215 --> 01:48:54.050
Why, Mr Anderson?

1161
01:48:54.259 --> 01:48:58.179
Why, why, why?

1162
01:48:58.388 --> 01:49:00.181
Why do you do it?

1163
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:02.267
Why? Why get up?

1164
01:49:02.475 --> 01:49:05.729
Why keep fighting?

1165
01:49:05.812 --> 01:49:08.473
Do you believe you're
fighting for something?

1166
01:49:08.481 --> 01:49:11.109
For more than your survival?

1167
01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:16.072
Can you tell me what it
is? Do you even know?

1168
01:49:18.074 --> 01:49:19.826
Is it freedom or truth?

1169
01:49:20.034 --> 01:49:22.328
Perhaps peace? Could
it be for love?

1170
01:49:22.537 --> 01:49:26.166
Illusions, Mr Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

1171
01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:29.519
Temporary constructs of a
feeble human intellect

1172
01:49:29.527 --> 01:49:32.040
trying desperately to
justify an existence

1173
01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:34.200
that is without
meaning or purpose.

1174
01:49:34.632 --> 01:49:38.052
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself,

1175
01:49:38.261 --> 01:49:41.580
although only a human mind
could invent something

1176
01:49:41.581 --> 01:49:43.181
as insipid as love.

1177
01:49:46.895 --> 01:49:49.015
You must be able to
see it, Mr Anderson.

1178
01:49:49.016 --> 01:49:50.316
You must know it by now.

1179
01:49:50.523 --> 01:49:52.995
You can't win. It's
pointless to keep fighting.

1180
01:49:56.488 --> 01:50:01.242
Why, Mr Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

1181
01:50:02.994 --> 01:50:06.748
Because I choose to.

1182
01:51:10.228 --> 01:51:14.733
This is my world. My world.

1183
01:51:37.964 --> 01:51:39.674
Wait.

1184
01:51:39.883 --> 01:51:43.052
I've seen this.

1185
01:51:43.261 --> 01:51:47.015
This is it. This is the end.

1186
01:51:47.265 --> 01:51:48.265
Yes.

1187
01:51:48.991 --> 01:51:50.425
You were laying right
there, just like that.

1188
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:53.605
And I, I...

1189
01:51:53.813 --> 01:51:55.870
I stand here, right here,

1190
01:51:55.871 --> 01:51:58.771
and I'm supposed to say something.

1191
01:51:59.819 --> 01:52:01.404
I say:

1192
01:52:01.613 --> 01:52:06.576
"Everything that has a
beginning has an end, Neo."

1193
01:52:13.917 --> 01:52:19.089
What? What did I just say?

1194
01:52:22.967 --> 01:52:28.306
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

1195
01:52:34.312 --> 01:52:35.939
Get away from me.

1196
01:52:36.147 --> 01:52:38.274
What are you afraid of?

1197
01:52:38.483 --> 01:52:40.110
It's a trick.

1198
01:52:40.318 --> 01:52:43.279
You were right, Smith.

1199
01:52:43.488 --> 01:52:46.866
You were always right.

1200
01:52:48.701 --> 01:52:51.830
It was inevitable.

1201
01:53:22.152 --> 01:53:25.155
Is it over?

1202
01:53:54.768 --> 01:53:57.145
Oh, no, no, no.

1203
01:53:57.353 --> 01:54:00.273
No, it's not fair.

1204
01:54:53.118 --> 01:54:56.955
It is done.

1205
01:55:27.402 --> 01:55:31.156
It doesn't make sense.

1206
01:55:33.658 --> 01:55:35.910
He did it.

1207
01:55:36.119 --> 01:55:38.413
He saved us.

1208
01:55:38.621 --> 01:55:41.166
He saved us.

1209
01:55:41.374 --> 01:55:44.627
It's over. He did it. He did it.

1210
01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:46.129
He did it. It's over.

1211
01:55:46.337 --> 01:55:48.798
It's over. He did it. He did it.

1212
01:55:49.007 --> 01:55:50.458
What is it? What happened?

1213
01:55:50.459 --> 01:55:52.530
Sir, he did it, sir.
Neo, he did it.

1214
01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.137
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

1215
01:55:54.345 --> 01:55:56.264
The machines are gone.

1216
01:55:56.473 --> 01:56:01.269
The war is over, sir.
The war is over.

1217
01:56:01.352 --> 01:56:04.731
Zion. Zion.

1218
01:56:04.939 --> 01:56:06.816
Zion, it's over.

1219
01:56:07.025 --> 01:56:08.485
It's over.

1220
01:56:08.693 --> 01:56:11.321
The war is over.

1221
01:56:11.529 --> 01:56:15.784
The war is over.

1222
01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:38.973
I have imagined this moment,

1223
01:56:39.182 --> 01:56:42.936
for so long.

1224
01:56:45.355 --> 01:56:48.608
Is this real?

1225
01:56:55.907 --> 01:56:59.536
Neo, wherever you are,

1226
01:56:59.744 --> 01:57:03.206
thank you.

1227
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:48.418
Good morning.

1228
01:58:08.188 --> 01:58:12.317
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

1229
01:58:12.525 --> 01:58:14.652
You played a very dangerous game.

1230
01:58:14.861 --> 01:58:17.530
Change always is.

1231
01:58:17.739 --> 01:58:22.202
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

1232
01:58:22.410 --> 01:58:26.081
As long as it can.

1233
01:58:27.916 --> 01:58:31.377
What about the others?

1234
01:58:31.586 --> 01:58:32.586
What others?

1235
01:58:32.871 --> 01:58:35.381
The ones that want out.

1236
01:58:35.590 --> 01:58:38.051
Obviously, they will be freed.

1237
01:58:38.259 --> 01:58:39.886
I have your word?

1238
01:58:40.095 --> 01:58:45.308
What do you think I am? Human?

1239
01:58:57.862 --> 01:59:00.949
Oracle.

1240
01:59:06.246 --> 01:59:08.373
We were afraid we
might not find you.

1241
01:59:08.581 --> 01:59:11.543
Everything's okay now.

1242
01:59:11.751 --> 01:59:13.878
Look, look.

1243
01:59:14.087 --> 01:59:16.965
Just look at that.

1244
01:59:17.173 --> 01:59:20.552
Beautiful.

1245
01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:23.346
Did you do that?

1246
01:59:23.555 --> 01:59:25.849
For Neo.

1247
01:59:26.057 --> 01:59:28.017
That's nice.

1248
01:59:28.226 --> 01:59:30.353
I know he'd love it.

1249
01:59:30.562 --> 01:59:32.939
Will we ever see him again?

1250
01:59:33.148 --> 01:59:35.859
I suspect so.

1251
01:59:36.067 --> 01:59:39.237
Someday.

1252
01:59:42.574 --> 01:59:44.325
Did you always know?

1253
01:59:44.534 --> 01:59:48.121
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

1254
01:59:48.329 --> 01:59:51.624
But I believed.

1255
01:59:51.833 --> 01:59:55.712
I believed.
