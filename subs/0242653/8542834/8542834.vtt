1
00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:24.791
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.501
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:28.336
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:30.463
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.716
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:35.343
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.179
ROLAND: Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.807
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:44.686
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.861
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:54.737
Thank you.

12
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:57.448
Any change?

13
00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.326
No.

14
00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.206
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:08.001
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:12.338
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:14.674
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.011
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:22.265
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:25.727
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:32.066
MORPHEUS: Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.485
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:34.694 --> 00:02:37.864
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:39.365
Please, for me.

25
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.587
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:52.754 --> 00:02:54.756
What?

27
00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:58.635
MAGGIE: His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:01.721
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:05.224
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:20.239
The big <i>bupkes. Nada.</i>
He's not in there.

31
00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.617
COLT: Sir, I got the projections.
ROLAND: How long?

32
00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:27.330
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:30.124
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:34.921
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.257
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:38.424 --> 00:03:40.551
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.595
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:45.890
- Hey! You got a call.
ROLAND: What?

39
00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.435
Operator.

40
00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:52.188
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:56.609
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:11.082
Good morning.

43
00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.837
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:20.091
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.261
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:30.476
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:36.566
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:40.028
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:44.157
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.870
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:52.373
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.461
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:11.017 --> 00:05:15.688
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.649
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:21.903
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:22.153 --> 00:05:25.156
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:32.163
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:35.208
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:35.374 --> 00:05:38.961
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.048
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.178
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:48.721
What choice?

63
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.016
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:57.105
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:57.271 --> 00:06:01.109
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:03.861
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:08.324
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:12.370
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:12.703 --> 00:06:17.250
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:21.754
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.467
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:26.634 --> 00:06:29.804
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:33.432
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.769
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:36.936 --> 00:06:38.771
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.484
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:48.239
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:52.160
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:54.829
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:58.666
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:03.588 --> 00:07:05.298

82
00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:07.675
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:07.842 --> 00:07:11.596
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:16.392
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:18.311
I don't.

86
00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:21.147
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:25.610
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:31.199
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:34.785
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:35.328 --> 00:07:37.872
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.373
No.

92
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.461
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:44.337 --> 00:07:47.632
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.552
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:53.221
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.729
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.691
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:10.571
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:12.740
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:15.534
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:20.164
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:24.418
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:27.088
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:27.255 --> 00:08:32.176
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:33.427 --> 00:08:34.929
It's okay.

106
00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:36.764
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:40.476
- I don't even know where "here" is.
RAMA: This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:43.437
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:47.942
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:50.319
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:54.448
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:57.493
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.622
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:05.042
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:06.836
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:07.003 --> 00:09:10.965
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:13.718
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:15.928
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:19.390
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:20.016 --> 00:09:22.310
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.276
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:30.443 --> 00:09:33.988
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:34.155 --> 00:09:36.866
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:39.702
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.247
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:47.084
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:52.006
- You do not understand.
- I just have never--

128
00:09:52.173 --> 00:09:54.550
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:59.680
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:59.847 --> 00:10:04.226
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:09.648
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:10.232 --> 00:10:14.195
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:15.696
Anything.

Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:21.327
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.961
That's him.

- We don't want trouble.

- Get the hell away from me!

It's not like the Trainman to be late.

You think it has something
to do with me?

146
00:12:00.468 --> 00:12:01.802
I cannot say.

147
00:12:01.969 --> 00:12:04.805
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

148
00:12:04.972 --> 00:12:07.850
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

149
00:12:08.058 --> 00:12:10.769
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

150
00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.481
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

Goodbye?

152
00:12:15.816 --> 00:12:18.486
- You're not staying with her?
RAMA: It is not possible.

153
00:12:18.652 --> 00:12:22.698
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

156
00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:32.917
Karma is a word, like love.

157
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.877
A way of saying:

158
00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:37.296
"What I am here to do."

159
00:12:37.463 --> 00:12:41.091
I do not resent my karma.

Why wouldn't she leave?
