1
00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:42.285
-Go, go, go, go.

2
00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:04.941
<i>We have a code.</i>

3
00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:24.261
-What the fuck.

4
00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:31.567
- <i>Who's that?</i>

5
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.805
<i>Drop him!</i>

6
00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:36.099
<i>Tell him about the end times.</i>

7
00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.201
<i>The war will ascend.</i>

8
00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:51.381
-How about we start with you
telling me your name.

9
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.652
-John.

10
00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:59.356
-John what?

11
00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:00.723
-Doe.

12
00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.032
-You think this is a game?

13
00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.869
-That's what you can call me.

14
00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:24.314
-Look, I'm your friend.
I'm here to help.

15
00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.652
We found you in that building
surrounded by 18 dead bodies.

16
00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:32.888
No one else in sight.
So we need some answers.

17
00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:37.460
And hey, maybe you didn't do it.

18
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.596
I'm here to help you.

19
00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:42.065
But you have to
give me the truth...

20
00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.073
unless you have
something to confess.

21
00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:54.911
God is always listening.

22
00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:58.548
-Can God forgive the devil?

23
00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:02.085
-So you did do it?

24
00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:17.367
-I've seen it all, John.

25
00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:21.204
Setting up an insanity plea
doesn't quite work that way.

26
00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:22.505
Now, I'm going to need you
to walk me through

27
00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:25.308
every step of this.

28
00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.143
My team reports state
that they found your belongings

29
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:33.016
in the security room,
so you're a security guard?

30
00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:35.652
-Night Watchman.

31
00:05:35.784 --> 00:05:39.923
-Fine. We'll start there.

32
00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:42.259
When did your employment begin?

33
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.630
<i>I needed a place to stay</i>

34
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.831
<i>and I heard a radio message.</i>

35
00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.834
<i>It said in exchange</i>
<i>for food and shelter,</i>

36
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.271
<i>they needed a Night Watchman.</i>

37
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.438
-Who are you?

38
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.343
-My name is An Voaen.

39
00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:08.978
-What you doing here?

40
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.650
<i>Night Watchman needed.</i>

41
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.151
<i>Food and shelter for work.</i>

42
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.954
<i>Location:</i>
<i>hospital.</i>

43
00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:20.256
- That's me.

44
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.659
I didn't think
anyone would come.

45
00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.694
Most of the people
that come here,

46
00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:26.696
they've lost hope in life.

47
00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:29.699
-Job still available?

48
00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:31.167
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

49
00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:32.936
You'll do just fine.

50
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:36.106
Welcome.
Come on. Let's go.

51
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.575
Yeah.

52
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:47.883
-You got a good privacy here.

53
00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.487
Everybody else
on the fourth floor.

54
00:07:50.587 --> 00:07:51.521
Come on.

55
00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:58.695
It's okay.

56
00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:01.264
Your own place.
I'll show you.

57
00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.601
Ey-ya!

58
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.937
Dewitt. Huh.
What are you doing there?

59
00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:11.875
- Usual. Watching over Mom.

60
00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:13.943
-This is Dewitt.

61
00:08:14.043 --> 00:08:16.980
Her mom, many years ago,
went crazy.

62
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.949
- Like way crazy.

63
00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:21.618
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move, move, move.

64
00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:25.755
This is An's room now.

65
00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:29.359
-So you're the new
Night Watchman?

66
00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:31.161
Yeah.

67
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.129
You cannot leave
your stuff here.

68
00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.399
I'll meet you at the canteen.
We'll get you some food.

69
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:52.449
So...
you ever fought before?

70
00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.556
-I will fight if I have to.

71
00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:04.461
-Well, when you have to fight,
are you any good?

72
00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:13.503
Help!

73
00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:36.526
-Aaaahhh!

74
00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:19.869
<i>I used to</i>
<i>fight but I lost control.</i>

75
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.171
<i>I had to learn to</i>
<i>keep it all inside.</i>

76
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:27.410
<i>Fighting only causes pain.</i>

77
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.015
<i>A Night</i>
<i>Watchman too afraid to fight.</i>

78
00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:33.683
<i>Now I've seen everything.</i>

79
00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.678
Are you the new
Night Watchman?

80
00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:02.845
-Yeah.

81
00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:05.448
-This is the bad time
of the month.

82
00:11:05.548 --> 00:11:09.519
The 15th day,
the seventh month onwards,

83
00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:14.058
the month of
the Fantasma Briento.

84
00:11:14.157 --> 00:11:16.659
-I'm sorry?

85
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.562
-The hungry ghosts.

86
00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:21.932
-Ghosts?

87
00:11:22.032 --> 00:11:24.001
Don't tell me
I'm looking for ghosts.

88
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.237
-It's not ghosts
we're afraid of.

89
00:11:28.338 --> 00:11:33.843
I'm Janett.
This is my son, Benison.

90
00:11:33.944 --> 00:11:37.213
-Hi, Janett. Benison.

91
00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:38.247
-Thank you for being here.

92
00:11:38.348 --> 00:11:41.317
We truly are grateful.

93
00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:45.822
Especially at night,
when they come.

94
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.736
- <i>Food rations are</i>
<i>now available at the canteen.</i>

96
00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:04.474
Oye! Zip it!

97

<i>Only one ticket per person.</i>

Here. Take this.

100
00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:13.149
This is how we organize
our rations.

101
00:12:13.249 --> 00:12:16.452
You know, food.

102
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:25.963
Take a seat.

103
00:12:26.063 --> 00:12:28.297
I'll get you your meal
in a moment.

104
00:12:28.398 --> 00:12:30.867
-Hey, new Night Watchman.

105
00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:45.149
You know, I-- I wish
we had some money for you.

106
00:12:45.248 --> 00:12:47.517
-No, I'm just grateful
for the meal.

107
00:12:47.617 --> 00:12:49.352
- I can't afford a meal.
- Yeah.

108
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:52.188
You haven't tried
the cooking yet.

109
00:12:52.288 --> 00:12:55.558
Just kidding.

110
00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:59.429
Ah, she's a pretty good cook.
At least your job will be easy.

111
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.565
I mean, nobody comes
around here anymore.

112
00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:06.136
Not since what happened
with the, yeah, well, you know.

113
00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:07.837
-What happened?

114
00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:10.339
Eh, children
went missing in the night.

115
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.809
Then end times prophesizes
when children go missing,

116
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.545
evil grows stronger.

117
00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:19.415
It might happen again,
but that's why you're here--

118
00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:23.386
to protect us.
In case this gets worse.

119
00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:25.155
-Child went missing?

120
00:13:25.254 --> 00:13:27.356
-You know,
ghosts come at night.

121
00:13:27.457 --> 00:13:30.560
Kids are sleeping,
nice and quiet.

122
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.929
-Ghosts come in?

123
00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:36.632
-Oh. Gho--
did I say ghosts?

124
00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.534
I mean, one second,
a child is there

125
00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:41.237
and the next second,
poof, gone.

126
00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:42.705
-Where did it come from?

127
00:13:44.507 --> 00:13:46.776
-Hm. That's a good question.

128
00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.377
Yeah.

129
00:13:51.014 --> 00:13:52.782
Hah.

130
00:13:52.882 --> 00:13:56.519
It wards off the evil--
ghosts, demons, and worse.

131
00:13:56.619 --> 00:13:59.156
-There he goes again
with that voodoo shit.

132
00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:02.226
-It's not voodoo.
And it's not shit!

133
00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:06.096
That's Hanuman.
He's the Monkey King.

134
00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:07.797
Very strong.

135
00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:11.034
-He gives them to everyone
who comes here.

136
00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:13.137
Nobody wears that.

137
00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:18.841
Yeah. You hang on to that.
Keep it in your pocket.

138
00:14:22.478 --> 00:14:25.448
That's Janett and Benison.

139
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.086
-I met them earlier.

140
00:14:29.186 --> 00:14:30.353
-Yeah.

141
00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:35.025
She's still freaked out
about that kid missing.

142
00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:40.663
Holds her son's hand so tight,
gonna squeeze it off. Hm.

143
00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:47.670
Hey, she like you.
She looking at you.

144
00:14:50.007 --> 00:14:51.507
But, mm...

145
00:14:51.607 --> 00:14:54.811
You don't wanna get involved
with a single mom, right?

146
00:14:58.248 --> 00:14:59.816
All right, see the little
blonde boy?

147
00:14:59.917 --> 00:15:04.288
That's Dylan.
Best friends with Benison.

148
00:15:04.387 --> 00:15:07.757
Too bad
those two have to grow up

149
00:15:07.857 --> 00:15:11.228
in this crazy world.

150
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:17.533
-These ghosts...
where do they come from?

151
00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:21.370
-I don't know.
I've never seen them before.

152
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.207
It just happened so fast.

153
00:15:23.307 --> 00:15:25.142
What are they
doing with the kids?

154
00:15:25.242 --> 00:15:26.375
-Who knows?

155
00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:33.116
Forced marriage,
crime, labor, sex.

156
00:15:33.217 --> 00:15:38.322
Did I say sex?
Ay-ya, eeh.

157
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.691
Get that out of my head.
I'm sorry.

158
00:15:41.791 --> 00:15:46.129
Here. Eat your food.
Come on. You must be hungry.

159
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:53.036
Where's the beef?

160
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.874
<i>That</i>

<i>I can see your past.</i>

171
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.917
Hey, pal.

172
00:17:14.017 --> 00:17:19.957
You were supposed to set up
a peace treaty with me

173
00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:23.927
and the leader
of the Eighth Street Gang.

174
00:17:24.027 --> 00:17:26.096
What the hell happened?

175
00:17:26.196 --> 00:17:29.465
-They threw the first punch.

176
00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:36.139
-Well... I sent you there
because you could fight,

177
00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:38.674
but it ended up costing me.

178
00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:42.179
Now, if they're to consider
a peace treaty,

179
00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.512
they want your head.

180
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.585
Nothing personal.
It's just business.

181
00:18:20.217 --> 00:18:21.717
-Yah.

182
00:18:27.457 --> 00:18:29.525
Aaahhhhh!

183
00:19:45.168 --> 00:19:49.906
- Ah, sheesh.

184
00:19:53.709 --> 00:19:55.811
You're just getting used
to things.

185
00:19:55.912 --> 00:19:58.681
You're just getting used
to things.

186
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:01.650
You're just getting used
to things.

187
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:14.897
-There's a child missing.

188
00:20:14.998 --> 00:20:16.765
No knows if
it's ghosts or demons.

189
00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:21.670
Not like you and me.
Ugh, dumbass.

190
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.772
Why are the cops here?

191
00:20:23.873 --> 00:20:25.509
They don't care
what happens here.

192
00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:27.344
Nobody cares.

193
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.482
-This happened last night?

194
00:20:32.582 --> 00:20:36.553
-Yeah. Don't worry.
Nobody blames you.

195
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:39.688
They're just worried
about the kids.

196
00:20:42.526 --> 00:20:45.262
- What's that smell?

197
00:20:45.362 --> 00:20:47.230
-Oh, sorry.

198
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.797
-No, it's not that.

199
00:20:52.735 --> 00:20:54.737
Please find my baby.

200
00:20:54.837 --> 00:20:57.706
I don't know what to do.
Nothing.

201
00:20:59.442 --> 00:21:03.947
-Was it Dylan?

202
00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:07.284
-I don't know.

203
00:21:07.384 --> 00:21:10.987
-I have to go find Dylan.

204
00:21:11.087 --> 00:21:15.225
I'm afraid it's him this time.

205
00:21:15.325 --> 00:21:20.796
Benison? Benison.

206
00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:22.966
I told you to
never leave my side.

207
00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:26.336
-I was just looking for Dylan.

208
00:21:28.004 --> 00:21:30.373
That's not Dylan's mom.

209
00:21:30.473 --> 00:21:32.475
I think he's okay.

210
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.348
-How did I not see them?

211
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:40.716
-Don't blame yourself.

212
00:21:40.816 --> 00:21:43.453
When you have time,
come by the apartment.

213
00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.523
We have something for you.

214
00:21:46.623 --> 00:21:50.026
-Okay.

215
00:21:50.126 --> 00:21:52.462
That smell keeps
giving me a headache.

216
00:22:12.382 --> 00:22:13.683
-Hey.

217
00:22:21.024 --> 00:22:22.459
-Did you want something?

218
00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:23.859
-Yeah. Um...

219
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.198
I noticed when you came in
that you only had one bag.

220
00:22:28.298 --> 00:22:30.133
-That's all I have.

221
00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:33.236
-Here.

222
00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:34.837
-What is that?

223
00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:38.174
-I told you before.
Fantasma Briento.

224
00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:40.977
-Oh, right.
Hungry Ghosts Month?

225
00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:43.647
I saw some other people
put them out.

226
00:22:43.747 --> 00:22:46.049
Boon-Nam says that's your thing.

227
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:47.717
-We leave offerings
for the dead,

228
00:22:47.816 --> 00:22:49.852
hoping that the spirits
of those who died here

229
00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:52.055
will take care of our children.

230
00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:55.625
-Surprised more people
believe in that stuff.

231
00:22:55.725 --> 00:22:59.162
-You're wearing
Boon-Nam's amulet.

232
00:22:59.262 --> 00:23:02.599
He chooses to pray to gods
for protection

233
00:23:02.699 --> 00:23:05.001
and I choose to give hope
instead.

234
00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:13.310
-I don't believe
in this stuff.

235
00:23:34.631 --> 00:23:36.333
Where's his father now?

236
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:46.343
-Met someone younger. Left and
never looked back.

237
00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:50.447
So did they hire you
because you can fight?

238
00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:52.515
- Aahhh!

239
00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:54.084
That's what
they're counting on.

240
00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.119
-Have you ever been
a Night Watchman?

241
00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:57.954
-No.

242
00:23:58.054 --> 00:24:00.190
-I guess we'll take
what we can get, huh?

243
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.292
They're frightened
and desperate.

244
00:24:04.893 --> 00:24:06.996
-Any idea who's behind all this?

245
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:10.899
-No. But I heard a name.

246
00:24:15.238 --> 00:24:17.340
Mephisto.

247
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.543
-Say that again.

248
00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:24.614
-Mephisto.

249
00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.182
-What else did you hear?

250
00:24:26.282 --> 00:24:28.284
-I heard about
the Four Horsemen,

251
00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:30.620
how they plan to use
the souls of children

252
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.059
to bring about the end times.

253
00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.728
Mephisto kidnaps children.

254
00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:41.798
That's how the evil
grows more powerful.

255
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.200
Once the evil is strong enough,

256
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.105
they will have a ceremony
and it will end everything.

257
00:24:49.205 --> 00:24:53.943
-Well, that's not what
my team has determined.

258
00:24:54.043 --> 00:24:57.781
-Half your team is dead
because of the evil.

259
00:24:57.881 --> 00:25:00.083
In order to stop the apocalypse,

260
00:25:00.183 --> 00:25:03.086
one has to kill
all of the Four Horsemen.

261
00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:10.393
The thing is, the Four Horsemen
look the same as everyone else.

262
00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:14.697
They look like me.
They look like you.

263
00:25:14.798 --> 00:25:16.032
Let's be clear.

264
00:25:16.132 --> 00:25:19.636
Half my team is dead
because of you.

265
00:25:19.736 --> 00:25:22.138
But let's get back
to your story.

266
00:25:25.442 --> 00:25:30.213
You say you saw
the Four Horsemen.

267
00:25:30.313 --> 00:25:32.215
-Some thought
they were ghosts.

268
00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:35.852
Some thought they were demons.
I knew the truth.

269
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:39.322
I start killing them,
one by one.

270
00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:59.776
<i>You're on</i>
<i>the right track, Night Watchman.</i>

271
00:25:59.876 --> 00:26:03.480
<i>The evil grows strong</i>
<i>underground.</i>

272
00:27:51.554 --> 00:27:54.857
<i>You can feel the evil inside.</i>

273
00:27:54.959 --> 00:27:57.860
<i>It calls your name.</i>

274
00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:21.784
-Hey! Drop the kid!

275
00:28:23.486 --> 00:28:24.787
-Get him.

276
00:29:49.572 --> 00:29:55.578
Bring the child.
The Babylon of perfection.

277
00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:59.983
their innocence
is my hunger.

278
00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:03.153
I need more children.
Only need.

279
00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:04.988
Not we need.

280
00:30:05.089 --> 00:30:11.494
Just one more child
for each of us.

281
00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:17.433
Our communion will be
complete with these children.

282
00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:21.004
As Horsemen,
we will ride a wave of blood

283
00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:25.508
that ushers in the apocalypse.

284
00:30:25.608 --> 00:30:33.117
All we need
is two more children.

285
00:30:33.217 --> 00:30:36.486
-It is much too soon, Samael.

286
00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:41.158
-It is not your job to tell us
when or how we do things.

287
00:30:41.257 --> 00:30:44.560
-It is never too soon
to feed off the young.

288
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.295
-Let's get ready.

289
00:30:46.395 --> 00:30:50.399
-And soon,
we will be unstoppable.

290
00:30:53.402 --> 00:30:54.871
<i>An?</i>

291
00:30:57.074 --> 00:30:58.208
He's still breathing.

292
00:30:58.307 --> 00:31:01.778
Come on. He's losing
too much blood.

293
00:31:01.878 --> 00:31:04.248
What are we gonna do?
He's gonna die.

294
00:31:04.347 --> 00:31:06.349
That's okay,
don't worry.

295
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.717
He's not gonna make it.

296
00:31:07.817 --> 00:31:12.488
I'm trying, okay?
I have no choice.

297
00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:19.428
I need you
to pay attention.

298
00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:22.365
We're gonna lose him.
Do anything.

299
00:31:38.714 --> 00:31:42.085
Drink something.
Please.

300
00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:45.454
Nothing. Nothing.

301
00:31:48.158 --> 00:31:51.894
-Is there anything else
we can do?

302
00:31:51.995 --> 00:31:54.097
-Yeah. Keep praying.

303
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:03.673
-An-an, you can do this.
I believe in you.

304
00:32:03.773 --> 00:32:06.944
<i>Death is not the end.</i>

305
00:32:07.044 --> 00:32:09.612
<i>There is still another way.</i>

306
00:32:19.488 --> 00:32:21.325
<i>Make sure</i>
<i>he is cleaned properly</i>

307
00:32:21.424 --> 00:32:23.893
<i>with water from</i>
<i>the blessed sacrament.</i>

308
00:32:23.994 --> 00:32:26.362
<i>There is a chance we can</i>
<i>bring him back from the dead</i>

309
00:32:26.462 --> 00:32:29.099
<i>if we are lucky.</i>

310
00:33:53.749 --> 00:33:56.153
<i>Death is calling.</i>

311
00:34:02.025 --> 00:34:05.795
<i>But yet you summoned me.</i>

312
00:34:12.202 --> 00:34:16.106
<i>Don't you know there are things</i>
<i>worse than death?</i>

313
00:34:22.913 --> 00:34:25.415
<i>You of pain.</i>

314
00:34:25.514 --> 00:34:30.120
<i>You come to my world</i>
<i>seeking life.</i>

315
00:34:37.928 --> 00:34:41.932
One foot in hell
and another on Earth.

316
00:34:42.032 --> 00:34:43.967
<i>But you are still here</i>

317
00:34:44.067 --> 00:34:47.737
<i>where death is</i>
<i>but inches from you.</i>

318
00:34:56.779 --> 00:35:00.217
<i>Will they know who I am?</i>

319
00:35:00.317 --> 00:35:02.618
<i>I'm Hanuman.</i>

320
00:35:02.718 --> 00:35:06.256
<i>In the end times,</i>
<i>I will give you</i>

321
00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:08.791
<i>a second chance on earth.</i>

322
00:35:17.501 --> 00:35:20.303
<i>Do as I say.</i>

323
00:35:20.404 --> 00:35:23.106
<i>Return to the land</i>
<i>of the living.</i>

324
00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:29.246
<i>I will summon you</i>
<i>when the time comes.</i>

325
00:35:48.864 --> 00:35:51.435
I got you.
I got you.

326
00:35:54.504 --> 00:35:55.671
-Where is Janett?

327
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:57.706
-She's upstairs with Benison,
giving him a bath.

328
00:35:57.807 --> 00:35:59.675
-I need to thank her.

329
00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:03.813
-Hey. You'll be okay.
I got you. I got you.

330
00:36:03.914 --> 00:36:06.582
When did you get up?
Do you need something to eat?

331
00:36:06.682 --> 00:36:09.052
-My head hurts really bad.

332
00:36:09.152 --> 00:36:11.254
-You have a fever.
Your body is healing.

333
00:36:11.354 --> 00:36:12.923
It's okay.

334
00:36:13.023 --> 00:36:15.125
-I've been seeing some things.

335
00:36:15.225 --> 00:36:17.327
-I-- I... shh.

336
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.829
Not-- not here.
Not in public.

337
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.431
-Did you do something to me?

338
00:36:21.531 --> 00:36:24.468
-Shh. Not here.
Okay. I got you. Come on.

339
00:36:24.568 --> 00:36:26.103
Let's take you somewhere else.

340
00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:40.050
-Quite a collection.

341
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.386
-Yes.
This is my family's legacy.

342
00:36:48.225 --> 00:36:52.628
You know, when I was in the
hospital with the theta variant,

343
00:36:52.728 --> 00:36:57.334
my mom, she would
tell me stories.

344
00:36:57.434 --> 00:36:59.136
The hospital closed,

345
00:36:59.236 --> 00:37:02.771
and I spent three years
trying to find them.

346
00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:06.476
Trying to figure out why
they never came back for me.

347
00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:11.982
I found out they were dead.

348
00:37:12.082 --> 00:37:16.752
-You never lived
in a regular house?

349
00:37:16.852 --> 00:37:18.854
-No, I was just 16.

350
00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:21.224
Deeds were turned back
to the government.

351
00:37:21.324 --> 00:37:23.293
I salvaged what I could,
brought it back here,

352
00:37:23.393 --> 00:37:25.694
and made this my home.

353
00:37:29.399 --> 00:37:31.700
-You believe in all this?

354
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.069
-I mean, it's about
protection and all,

355
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.275
but sometimes I wonder,
what is it protecting us from?

356
00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:40.377
Maybe even ourselves.

357
00:38:07.637 --> 00:38:09.039
-I want out.

358
00:38:12.075 --> 00:38:15.711
-And where are you gonna go?

359
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:18.215
Rival gang's looking for you.

360
00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.755
Police. Hm?

361
00:38:26.855 --> 00:38:31.428
In fact, I think
I'll be doing you a favor.

362
00:38:31.528 --> 00:38:33.862
Bringing them your head now.

363
00:38:33.964 --> 00:38:35.999
-This ends tonight.

364
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.239
-Get rid of him.

365
00:38:42.339 --> 00:38:44.441
-Haah!

366
00:41:10.787 --> 00:41:13.423
-You okay?

367
00:41:13.523 --> 00:41:16.326
-You got a ritual
to make me stop hallucinating?

368
00:41:16.426 --> 00:41:18.628
That's what I need.

369
00:41:18.728 --> 00:41:21.297
-Remember,
Hanuman needs a host.

370
00:41:21.398 --> 00:41:26.002
He may try to control you,
but he cannot kill you.

371
00:41:26.102 --> 00:41:27.637
-I need to do my rounds.

372
00:41:32.008 --> 00:41:33.843
-He's right.

373
00:41:33.943 --> 00:41:35.845
I've seen people
possessed before.

374
00:41:35.945 --> 00:41:38.848
There's always an explanation.

375
00:41:38.948 --> 00:41:42.385
The mind is a powerful thing.

376
00:41:42.485 --> 00:41:46.856
Let's get back to Mephisto
and these Horsemen.

377
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:52.195
You think that they kidnapped
the children, hm?

378
00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:55.098
-Don't you?

379
00:41:55.198 --> 00:41:57.300
-You want to know what I think?

380
00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.602
I think this is all bullshit
you made up

381
00:41:59.702 --> 00:42:02.872
because you failed
to do your job.

382
00:42:02.972 --> 00:42:04.774
I came here
because I intend to save

383
00:42:04.874 --> 00:42:07.010
the stolen children.

384
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.780
You came here
because you were arrested.

385
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.017
You see, those children...

386
00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:16.921
I'm going to prove
that you took them.

387
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.558
-What if the truth
is more than that?

388
00:42:31.901 --> 00:42:37.373
Mister An?
What are you doing?

389
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.377
-I locked the door,

390
00:42:41.478 --> 00:42:45.448
making sure
no one gets in or out.

391
00:42:45.548 --> 00:42:48.251
What are you doing here?
Where's your mom?

392
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:53.690
-She's waiting for some supper
from Auntie Charlotte.

393
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.861
I told her
I'm gonna talk to you.

394
00:42:57.962 --> 00:43:01.932
-Sure.
What you got on your mind?

395
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:06.669
-Where is Dylan?
Are you going to find him?

396
00:43:06.769 --> 00:43:10.106
I miss him.

397
00:43:10.206 --> 00:43:11.741
-I'm gonna find him.

398
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:21.150
-I think you can protect us all.

399
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:24.587
-I can barely protect myself.

400
00:43:24.687 --> 00:43:28.258
-But you look strong.

401
00:43:30.693 --> 00:43:37.001
-This body can take
a beating. I admit that.

402
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:42.872
-Mister An, are you okay?

403
00:43:42.973 --> 00:43:49.479
-Yeah. Adults,
you know, we think too much.

404
00:43:49.579 --> 00:43:51.047
-You're a good man.

405
00:43:55.718 --> 00:43:57.922
-That's a first.

406
00:43:58.022 --> 00:44:02.125
-You know, my mom always says

407
00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:07.597
when you see someone,
always close your eyes.

408
00:44:07.697 --> 00:44:13.703
Because you can only know
someone when you feel them.

409
00:44:13.803 --> 00:44:16.706
Try it.

410
00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:17.840
-I know.

411
00:44:17.942 --> 00:44:20.877
-Try it.

412
00:44:20.978 --> 00:44:22.378
-Okay.

413
00:44:22.478 --> 00:44:23.613
-Follow me.

414
00:44:30.386 --> 00:44:32.789
<i>Before the boy,</i>

415
00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:36.626
<i>I know what you are.</i>
<i>A killer.</i>

416
00:44:36.726 --> 00:44:39.529
<i>Kill the Four Horsemen</i>
<i>of the Apocalypse</i>

417
00:44:39.629 --> 00:44:42.699
<i>and anyone</i>
<i>that stands in our way.</i>

418
00:44:48.237 --> 00:44:55.278
-See. I can feel
what a good man you are,

419
00:44:55.378 --> 00:45:00.383
and you're going to
protect us all.

420
00:45:00.483 --> 00:45:03.286
<i>The boy is wrong.</i>

421
00:45:07.024 --> 00:45:09.093
<i>Go with them.</i>

422
00:45:09.192 --> 00:45:12.930
Pinky promise?

423
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.099
I promise.

424
00:45:15.198 --> 00:45:16.633
<i>Benison.</i>

425
00:45:22.372 --> 00:45:25.909
You're looking better.
Have you been resting?

426
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.311
-I never got a chance
to thank you.

427
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.080
-I didn't do anything.
-Yes, you did.

428
00:45:30.179 --> 00:45:33.984
You took care of me
when I needed it most.

429
00:45:34.084 --> 00:45:35.718
You saved me.

430
00:45:41.157 --> 00:45:42.792
<i>We'll kill her too,</i>

431
00:45:42.892 --> 00:45:45.695
<i>if she tries to stop us.</i>

432
00:45:45.795 --> 00:45:47.463
-Stay in your rooms tonight.

433
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.142
<i>I can see what you are.</i>

434
00:46:04.447 --> 00:46:07.717
<i>Tonight will still proceed.</i>

435
00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:19.063
<i>You can smell it, can't you?</i>

436
00:46:19.163 --> 00:46:23.566
<i>The hunger.</i>
<i>Go and hide yourself. Go.</i>

437
00:47:44.647 --> 00:47:45.715
-Hey!

438
00:47:50.353 --> 00:47:53.090
Benison! Drop the kid.

439
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.292
Aaaaahhhhhhh!

440
00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:15.878
<i>Get up.</i>

441
00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:22.986
I will not deny
the power of the body.

442
00:48:26.856 --> 00:48:29.358
Rise and destroy them.

443
00:48:33.396 --> 00:48:35.598
-You ain't getting up
from that one.

444
00:48:38.168 --> 00:48:39.836
It's finished.

445
00:48:53.482 --> 00:48:55.785
We had a deal.

446
00:48:55.885 --> 00:49:00.123
<i>You give me blood,</i>
<i>I give you life.</i>

447
00:49:09.866 --> 00:49:11.400
-What the hell?

448
00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:15.471
<i>Tear their flesh.</i>

449
00:49:15.571 --> 00:49:17.840
<i>Rip their souls.</i>

450
00:49:45.902 --> 00:49:47.971
-Give me the boy.

451
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:49.907
Give me the boy!

452
00:50:18.634 --> 00:50:23.173
<i>until I know.</i>

453
00:50:37.321 --> 00:50:40.190
-Let me get this straight.

454
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.159
You made a deal with the devil,

455
00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:46.997
and it's consuming your soul
every time you fight.

456
00:50:47.097 --> 00:50:50.000
-Death God.

457
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:53.569
-Right. Death God.

458
00:50:53.669 --> 00:50:56.006
So it just came right out
and made a deal with you.

459
00:50:56.106 --> 00:50:57.673
Like that?

460
00:50:57.773 --> 00:51:00.377
-Must have been
something Boon-Nam did

461
00:51:00.476 --> 00:51:03.180
when I was
on the brink of death.

462
00:51:06.016 --> 00:51:08.952
-A curse?

463
00:51:09.052 --> 00:51:13.589
-Depends on what you think of
as a curse.

464
00:51:13.689 --> 00:51:15.858
Some may want this curse.

465
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:24.234
-Well, it's kept you alive
this far.

466
00:51:24.334 --> 00:51:26.403
Barely.

467
00:51:26.502 --> 00:51:28.704
Can't say much
for the rest of them.

468
00:51:31.108 --> 00:51:32.575
What happened next?

469
00:51:34.277 --> 00:51:39.049
Benison!

470
00:51:39.149 --> 00:51:40.017
What the hell?

471
00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:44.354
They took Benison.
My baby. Benison!

472
00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:47.924
Benison. They took him.
They took him.

473
00:51:48.025 --> 00:51:49.259
Keep still.

474
00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.394
Where's An?

475
00:51:50.494 --> 00:51:54.131
-They took him.
They took Benison.

476
00:52:06.043 --> 00:52:09.312
<i>For each soul you take,</i>

477
00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:12.648
<i>each time you spill blood,</i>

478
00:52:12.748 --> 00:52:18.221
<i>a little more of your soul</i>
<i>belongs to me.</i>

479
00:52:34.037 --> 00:52:37.606
The child we
brought back is awake, Mephisto.

480
00:52:37.706 --> 00:52:40.410
-Immunity builds quick.

481
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:43.712
We should have enough
to get the last one.

482
00:52:43.813 --> 00:52:46.149
You join him with the rest.

483
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:02.532
Be comfortable, my children.

484
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:06.503
Patience, 'cause
there's only one more.

485
00:53:06.602 --> 00:53:09.539
-We should begin
the ritual, Mephisto.

486
00:53:09.638 --> 00:53:13.944
-Not until we have
the last child.

487
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.635
<i>Here they come.</i>

488
00:53:39.735 --> 00:53:41.404
<i>Now is your chance.</i>

489
00:53:49.678 --> 00:53:52.616
-Which one should we get
this time?

490
00:53:52.715 --> 00:53:55.085
-Doesn't matter.
Whatever we find next.

491
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.623
-Tell me where the kids are!

492
00:54:36.993 --> 00:54:39.563
<i>Another dead body.</i>

493
00:54:48.405 --> 00:54:51.308
<i>Can you feel our powers</i>

494
00:54:51.408 --> 00:54:54.344
<i>growing stronger?</i>

495
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:12.295
more blood.

496
00:55:21.972 --> 00:55:25.874
More vengeance for your soul.

497
00:55:30.547 --> 00:55:33.116
A metamorphosis,
you say?

498
00:55:33.216 --> 00:55:34.951
Shapeshifting perhaps.

499
00:55:35.051 --> 00:55:36.620
He was turning into something.

500
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.021
Turning?

501
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:41.890
How has the Night
Watchman grown so strong?

502
00:55:41.992 --> 00:55:45.295
This man is the work
of the devil himself.

503
00:55:45.395 --> 00:55:46.563
How about is it done?

504
00:55:46.663 --> 00:55:49.865
A demon inside his body.

505
00:55:49.966 --> 00:55:53.802
,
especially the old man.

506
00:55:53.902 --> 00:55:56.106
I think he answers
to some kind of Death God.

507
00:55:56.206 --> 00:56:00.143
If it's human,
we can still kill it.

508
00:56:00.243 --> 00:56:02.512
There is no other god.

509
00:56:02.612 --> 00:56:06.283
Kill the body
and the demon dies with it.

510
00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:11.154
<i>There is no time.</i>

511
00:56:11.254 --> 00:56:13.822
<i>The demon's fusing itself</i>
<i>to the man's body.</i>

512
00:56:13.923 --> 00:56:15.191
<i>If too much time passes,</i>

513
00:56:15.292 --> 00:56:17.360
<i>Hanuman manifests</i>
<i>its physical form</i>

514
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.928
<i>through his flesh.</i>

515
00:56:22.432 --> 00:56:25.368
If he is trying
to kill the Four Horsemen

516
00:56:25.468 --> 00:56:27.237
to stop the Apocalypse,

517
00:56:27.337 --> 00:56:31.908
then our aim is to kill
the Night Watchman.

518
00:56:32.008 --> 00:56:33.743
We have enough
children to start the ritual

519
00:56:33.842 --> 00:56:36.879
for our essentials.
Let us begin.

520
00:56:38.048 --> 00:56:40.083
So, they came
for you this time, huh?

521
00:56:40.183 --> 00:56:43.553
Why do you want to call it now?
Self-defense?

522
00:56:43.653 --> 00:56:46.690
-I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

523
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:49.492
-Then give me a confession.

524
00:56:53.063 --> 00:56:54.998
-This is the confession.

525
00:56:56.899 --> 00:57:01.404
The story. The journey...

526
00:57:01.504 --> 00:57:03.440
<i>Detective.</i>

527
00:57:16.553 --> 00:57:17.886
An.

528
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.673
Is that where the children are?

529
00:57:36.773 --> 00:57:39.976
-The evil is behind the door.

530
00:57:40.076 --> 00:57:43.913
The children won't be alive
much longer.

531
00:57:44.013 --> 00:57:46.282
And the only way to end this

532
00:57:49.052 --> 00:57:53.556
is to give up what's left
of my soul to Hanuman.

533
00:57:53.656 --> 00:57:58.661
I might have to lure them out.
It's gonna be very dangerous.

534
00:57:58.762 --> 00:58:02.632
The kids are living
on borrowed time.

535
00:58:02.732 --> 00:58:04.501
-What can we do to help?

536
00:58:04.601 --> 00:58:07.036
-I could save the children.

537
00:58:07.137 --> 00:58:12.075
<i>But you're gonna have to do</i>
<i>exactly as I say.</i>

538
00:58:12.175 --> 00:58:15.145
<i>Gather the others,</i>
<i>wall yourselves in.</i>

539
00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:19.249
<i>Don't answer to anyone</i>
<i>including me.</i>

540
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:23.987
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>stay inside.</i>

541
00:58:24.087 --> 00:58:27.223
<i>You could pray to whatever god</i>
<i>you believe in,</i>

542
00:58:27.323 --> 00:58:34.230
<i>but tonight only one</i>
<i>will answer: Death.</i>

543
00:58:44.941 --> 00:58:47.811
-Let this be God.

544
00:58:49.579 --> 00:58:51.848
He turned it off.

545
00:58:51.948 --> 00:58:53.516
He's luring us.

546
00:58:53.616 --> 00:58:57.287
Take him out!

547
00:59:01.658 --> 00:59:05.795
No. I got him this time.

548
00:59:23.446 --> 00:59:24.414
Control the exit.

549
00:59:39.429 --> 00:59:41.464
Let me see.

550
00:59:48.304 --> 00:59:53.476
-Hanuman.
The glory of Rama.

551
00:59:53.576 --> 00:59:57.046
God of fighting.

552
00:59:57.146 --> 01:00:00.183
-King of fighting, huh?

553
01:00:00.283 --> 01:00:02.185
Well, let's see what it can do.

554
01:00:47.864 --> 01:00:49.098
-Something's wrong.

555
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.715
-We have to help him.

556
01:01:05.815 --> 01:01:06.816
-You said
he wants us to stay here,

557
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.184
no matter what happens.

558
01:01:08.284 --> 01:01:09.954
-Something is wrong.

559
01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:19.395
-So? Are you gonna help or what?

560
01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:27.570
-You fight with no conviction.

561
01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.044
-This is how you die.

562
01:01:45.154 --> 01:01:46.856
-Let him go.

563
01:01:51.996 --> 01:01:54.297
Look at this bitch.

564
01:01:54.397 --> 01:01:56.866
Always have someone
helping you, huh?

565
01:02:06.876 --> 01:02:09.278
-Sure you know how to use that?

566
01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:11.180
-We fight in numbers.

567
01:02:13.216 --> 01:02:16.819
-I'll be back with more.

568
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.256
-It's over.
Where's Benison?

569
01:02:20.356 --> 01:02:22.492
-I ain't tellin' you shit.

570
01:02:22.592 --> 01:02:23.760
-Get him!

571
01:02:30.566 --> 01:02:33.070
-No! No!

572
01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:36.006
-No, no, no. Stop! Stop!
Don't go there.

573
01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:37.407
-I'm gonna kill you.

574
01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:39.876
You can't hide forever,
motherfucker!

575
01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:43.013
Let me go.
No. I wanna get my son.

576
01:02:43.113 --> 01:02:45.815
-Okay, okay.
We'll come another time.

577
01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:47.450
-Fuck!

578
01:02:51.187 --> 01:02:52.089
<i>You are not done</i>

579
01:02:52.188 --> 01:02:55.458
<i>with the slaughter yet.</i>

580
01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:01.831
<i>isn't gonna</i>

581
01:03:01.932 --> 01:03:04.001
<i>escape from our deal.</i>

582
01:03:08.906 --> 01:03:10.673
That's how it works

583
01:03:10.773 --> 01:03:15.112
despite your first guide.

584
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:17.613
-That's not why
I killed myself.

585
01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:22.318
thoughts
went through your head.

586
01:03:22.418 --> 01:03:24.687
-I needed to find a way...

587
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:29.258
to my darkness.

588
01:03:29.358 --> 01:03:32.295
Palace of the Death God.

589
01:03:32.395 --> 01:03:36.265
soul.

590
01:03:36.365 --> 01:03:41.671
-A deal was done
without my assent.

591
01:03:41.771 --> 01:03:48.511
What if I give it to you
fully... right now?

592
01:03:48.611 --> 01:03:53.616
There is no going back
once you take out my full power.

593
01:03:53.716 --> 01:03:54.918
-Mm-hm.

594
01:03:57.087 --> 01:04:02.391
Your body and soul
will be mine for eternity.

595
01:04:02.492 --> 01:04:05.895
And I will be rewarding
the.

596
01:04:05.996 --> 01:04:09.532
Do it! Do it.

597
01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:16.272
So be it.
You got the staff of Hanuman.

598
01:04:16.372 --> 01:04:18.307
Become the darkness.

599
01:04:21.344 --> 01:04:25.015
<i>Return to your world</i>
<i>one last time.</i>

600
01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:28.085
<i>Show them.</i>

601
01:04:28.185 --> 01:04:31.721
<i>your body and soul.</i>

602
01:04:31.821 --> 01:04:34.258
<i>Unlimited powers...</i>

603
01:04:41.064 --> 01:04:46.036
<i>and your body will become mine.</i>

604
01:04:51.507 --> 01:04:59.615
<i>my power</i>
<i>every soul.</i>

605
01:05:02.585 --> 01:05:04.087
Fuck.

606
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:09.826
He had some help.

607
01:05:09.927 --> 01:05:12.795
The squatters
are beginning to revolt.

608
01:05:12.895 --> 01:05:18.401
They find strength and resolve
in his presence.

609
01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:21.470
-I'm gonna fucking
kill them next time.

610
01:05:21.571 --> 01:05:25.175
But you could
do with a little help.

611
01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:27.577
Your goal
is to find a weakness

612
01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:30.713
to sever the ties
between this Night Watchman

613
01:05:30.813 --> 01:05:33.349
and his Death God.

614
01:05:33.449 --> 01:05:34.817
What?

615
01:05:34.918 --> 01:05:38.121
Fight Eastern gods
with Eastern magic.

616
01:05:38.222 --> 01:05:41.457
Nam man prai, corpse oil.

617
01:05:41.557 --> 01:05:45.394
That is the weakness of the
spirits who have crossed over.

618
01:05:45.494 --> 01:05:47.097
We need the body
of a pregnant woman

619
01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:49.832
who died a tragic death,

620
01:05:49.933 --> 01:05:53.136
we extract it
by burning the chin

621
01:05:53.237 --> 01:05:56.974
the cursed candle
until the oil forms.

622
01:06:00.776 --> 01:06:03.713
Use this to stop him.

623
01:06:03.813 --> 01:06:09.585
But be warned, it only works
for a short time.

624
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.400
-An?

625
01:06:29.672 --> 01:06:32.042
I've been looking
all over for you.

626
01:06:32.142 --> 01:06:33.676
I thought you were dead.

627
01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:44.087
You look different.

628
01:06:44.187 --> 01:06:47.024
-I'm gonna get
the children back.

629
01:06:47.124 --> 01:06:50.327
I will not fail this time.

630
01:06:50.426 --> 01:06:53.863
-We tried chasing him.

631
01:06:53.964 --> 01:06:55.933
They disappeared
behind the door again.

632
01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.970
-That door.

633
01:07:29.933 --> 01:07:31.034
-What did you say?

634
01:07:35.272 --> 01:07:36.406
-The legend goes

635
01:07:36.505 --> 01:07:40.377
that if you pray to
the statue of Santa Maria,

636
01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:44.114
she will point you
the right way.

637
01:07:44.214 --> 01:07:48.517
-Point?

638
01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:51.154
-Give you guidance, you know?

639
01:07:57.493 --> 01:08:00.964
<i>All is not lost.</i>

640
01:08:01.064 --> 01:08:04.667
<i>You can still save them</i>
<i>by redeeming yourself.</i>

641
01:08:07.603 --> 01:08:11.341
-An? An?
An, where are you going?

642
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:12.641
-Just stay here.

643
01:08:25.122 --> 01:08:30.127
Okay, Santa Maria, I'm here.

644
01:08:30.227 --> 01:08:31.727
What are you trying to tell me?

645
01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:52.949
<i>There is no turning back now.</i>

646
01:10:04.321 --> 01:10:05.654
<i>Find the last Horseman</i>

647
01:10:05.754 --> 01:10:07.324
<i>of the Apocalypse</i> .

648
01:11:05.748 --> 01:11:08.851
-Aaaaaaahhhhhh!

649
01:11:18.662 --> 01:11:20.564
You're like
a fucking rat.

650
01:11:20.664 --> 01:11:25.235
-Give me the kids. Go.

651
01:11:25.335 --> 01:11:29.906
-I can't do that.
It's time.

652
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.214
Take him out, Samael,
and be quick about it.

653
01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:38.315
-Aaah!

654
01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.342
Yah!

655
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:23.693
How's it feel?

656
01:12:23.826 --> 01:12:26.196
Powerless?

657
01:12:26.296 --> 01:12:29.032
Scared?

658
01:12:29.132 --> 01:12:31.800
Fucking weak?

659
01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.671
You got nothing now.
Where's your God now?

660
01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:11.267
- Hanuman.

661
01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.468
-Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

662
01:15:51.568 --> 01:15:54.437
How does it feel, Death God?

663
01:15:54.537 --> 01:15:56.072
Like the pain?

664
01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:57.340
Fucking powerless?

665
01:16:17.962 --> 01:16:20.163
Yaaahhh!

666
01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:06.876
Mister An.

667
01:17:06.977 --> 01:17:08.745
-Stay away from me.

668
01:17:08.845 --> 01:17:13.683
-Don't worry.
We're here for you.

669
01:18:52.116 --> 01:18:55.151
-A demon, huh?

670
01:18:55.251 --> 01:19:01.391
Great story.
Tragic ending.

671
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:06.429
So you didn't get Mephisto,
I see.

672
01:19:06.529 --> 01:19:09.332
-Not yet anyway,

673
01:19:09.432 --> 01:19:14.237
but he's sitting
right in front of me.

674
01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:16.406
-What the hell
are you talking about?

675
01:19:21.045 --> 01:19:23.713
-I know it was you.

676
01:19:23.813 --> 01:19:27.183
<i>I remember that smell like</i>
<i>the first time I smelled it.</i>

677
01:19:27.283 --> 01:19:29.886
<i>The smell of evil and death.</i>

678
01:19:29.987 --> 01:19:33.790
<i>The first time I saw you guys,</i>
<i>I didn't think much at first...</i>

679
01:19:36.192 --> 01:19:37.794
<i>until you came.</i>

680
01:19:40.196 --> 01:19:45.535
<i>Your stench, Mephisto,</i>
<i>never lies.</i>

681
01:19:46.636 --> 01:19:49.439
-Aaaahh! What the hell
are you talking about?

682
01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:53.242
-I let myself get caught.

683
01:19:53.342 --> 01:19:54.677
I had to make sure.

684
01:19:54.777 --> 01:19:56.279
-Bullshit!

685
01:20:02.585 --> 01:20:05.688
- We meet
without the mask, Mephisto.

686
01:20:05.788 --> 01:20:11.527
-You're gonna accuse me
based on smell?

687
01:20:11.627 --> 01:20:15.832
-See, the thing about being
the Death God is...

688
01:20:15.933 --> 01:20:17.467
you can see the dead.

689
01:20:21.337 --> 01:20:23.207
Don't kill him.

690
01:20:23.306 --> 01:20:25.943
You can feel little.

691
01:20:26.043 --> 01:20:28.511
An, you have a choice.

692
01:20:28.611 --> 01:20:30.513
Don't kill him.
-You kill me,

693
01:20:30.613 --> 01:20:36.954
everyone in the hospital
will be prosecuted or worse.

694
01:20:37.054 --> 01:20:38.821
Your fault.

695
01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:41.191
's the bad guy.

696
01:20:41.290 --> 01:20:46.596
-Bad, good...
it's a human construct.

697
01:20:46.696 --> 01:20:50.900
I'm just Hanuman
and you're just a man.

698
01:21:13.389 --> 01:21:16.826
-I will still ascend.

699
01:21:16.927 --> 01:21:19.229
-I'm a Death God.

700
01:21:19.328 --> 01:21:21.464
I will take you there
personally.

701
01:21:30.606 --> 01:21:32.842
<i>You please the Death God.</i>

702
01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:37.047
<i>Now is</i>
<i>finally complete.</i>

703
01:21:37.147 --> 01:21:40.650
<i>has folded.</i>

704
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:44.154
<i>The Four Horsemen</i>
<i>of the Apocalypse are killed.</i>

705
01:21:44.254 --> 01:21:47.723
<i>Our deal is done.</i>

706
01:21:47.824 --> 01:21:50.393
-Thank you.

707
01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:52.461
-Thank you.
Thank you so much.

708
01:21:52.562 --> 01:21:54.164
<i>power,</i>

709
01:21:54.264 --> 01:21:56.766
<i>you wielded the staff.</i>

710
01:21:56.866 --> 01:22:00.003
<i>You spilled the blood.</i>

711
01:22:00.103 --> 01:22:06.442
<i>And now, your body</i>
<i>belongs to me.</i>

712
01:22:06.542 --> 01:22:07.911
I want you to stay.

713
01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:09.079
You can stay with us.

714
01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:12.115
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

715
01:22:12.216 --> 01:22:14.985
Please stay.

716
01:22:15.085 --> 01:22:16.786
-You gave us hope.

717
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:40.877
<i>And</i>
<i>the doom world is so divided.</i>

718
01:22:40.978 --> 01:22:44.614
<i>I am Hanuman.</i>

719
01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:50.153
<i>The harbinger</i>
<i>of pain and suffering.</i>

720
01:22:50.254 --> 01:22:55.825
<i>Nothing will stand in my way.</i>

721
01:22:55.926 --> 01:23:02.899
<i>Let the piles of the dead stack</i>
<i>all the way to heaven's gate.</i>

722
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.773
<i>Now begins the end time.</i>
<i>Death is calling.</i>
