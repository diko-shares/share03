00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.557
Always by my side. Always!

2
00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.976
I just can't believe
I'm doing this,

3
00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.645
- we should have kept on
scamming tourists and be done.

4
00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:43.297
- Do you want me
to explain again?

5
00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:46.733
These snakeskins are worth more than
the purses and wallets that you steal.

6
00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:48.694
I don't care about that.

7
00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:50.529
- Look, it’s suicide to be here.

8
00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.757
It’s suicide because you don’t
do what I tell you to do.

9
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.366
- By my side!
- No, I said no.

10
00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:56.869
It’s insane to be hunting
at a place like this.

11
00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:58.662
I’m not afraid of Las Arenas.

12
00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:00.581
Well, I am, so what?

13
00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:04.251
- See that? Bye!
- Stay here! Stay!

14
00:52:12.756 --> 00:52:15.634
Hey, hey! look at me.

15
00:52:17.386 --> 00:52:18.929
Are my friends alive?

16
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:23.767
Do you want money?

17
00:52:26.562 --> 00:52:29.802
I’ve got 200 dollars. If you want them,
they are yours but tell me where they are.

18
00:52:32.276 --> 00:52:33.402
Hand them over.

19
00:52:34.278 --> 00:52:35.905
They are upstairs in my bag.

20
00:52:36.947 --> 00:52:40.034
When we get out of here I’ll tell the
police this was all a misunderstanding,

21
00:52:40.117 --> 00:52:41.997
I made a mistake and then
I give you the money.

22
00:52:45.497 --> 00:52:46.999
Give me that watch.

23
00:52:54.048 --> 00:52:55.883
It was my dad’s.

24
00:52:57.676 --> 00:52:59.136
Then don’t give me anything.

25
00:53:05.643 --> 00:53:07.978
This is worth a lot, you
better start talking.

26
00:53:14.526 --> 00:53:15.945
A week ago,

27
00:53:17.863 --> 00:53:19.907
I was hunting snakes,

28
00:53:21.408 --> 00:53:22.660
Snakes?

29
00:53:24.119 --> 00:53:24.828
Yes,

30
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:28.332
venom is well paid. Skins too,

31
00:53:29.583 --> 00:53:30.876
I was at Las Arenas.

32
00:53:32.044 --> 00:53:33.462
Is that where they are?

33
00:53:35.381 --> 00:53:36.924
That’s where I saw them.

34
00:53:37.424 --> 00:53:38.926
But they are alright.

35
00:53:39.885 --> 00:53:41.845
Do you know why it’s
called Las Arenas?

36
00:53:44.306 --> 00:53:47.685
That place is called Las Arenas
because there’s a lot of quicksands,

37
00:53:48.018 --> 00:53:52.147
There’s no quicksand in this
country; that’s bullshit.

38
00:53:54.984 --> 00:53:57.820
Did you know I went hunting with
a friend, but I came back alone.

39
00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:01.281
If you don’t want to believe
me, it’s your problem,

40
00:54:02.199 --> 00:54:03.909
but they are in danger.

41
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.294
Hey buddy,

42
00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:18.549
I'm a doctor; I organized
the conference here;

43
00:54:18.757 --> 00:54:19.842
let me out.

44
00:54:20.426 --> 00:54:23.012
I mean it; my friends
are in danger.

45
00:54:23.303 --> 00:54:25.097
If you want, call the manager.

46
00:54:26.265 --> 00:54:28.183
Let me out!
