1
00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.625
- Aah!
- Shh!

2
00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:35.639
Always by
my side. Always by my side!

3
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:38.934
I just can't believe
I'm doing this,

4
00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:41.812
we should have kept on
scamming tourists and be done.

5
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.313
Do you want me to explain?

6
00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:44.749
These snakeskins
are worth more than

7
00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:46.525
the purses and wallets
that you steal.

8
00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.944
I don't care about that.

9
00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:50.737
Look, it's suicide to be here.

10
00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:52.507
It's suicide because you
don't do what I tell you.

11
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:53.949
- By my side!
- No. I said no.

12
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.451
It's insane to be hunting
at a place like this.

13
00:01:56.493 --> 00:01:58.328
I'm not afraid of Las Arenas.

14
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.955
Well, I am, so what?

15
00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.251
- See that? Bye!
- Stay here! Stay!

16
00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.042
Aah!

17
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.475
Josh:
So, we're here.

18
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:19.665
How does it feel to be home?

19
00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.559
Sof?

20
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.811
Give me a second.

21
00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:31.898
I mean, this is where
you were born right?

22
00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:33.483
Aren't you, I don't know,

23
00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:37.262
maybe a little bit
nostalgic, maybe?

24
00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:41.742
Yeah, maybe.

25
00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:45.912
It feels weird to be here.

26
00:04:45.954 --> 00:04:49.291
It's been a while without
being in Colombia.

27
00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:57.299
God.

28
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.010
You and your guidebooks.

29
00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:03.972
I do like to do my research.

30
00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:09.603
These rainforests,
they look amazing.

31
00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:11.730
You're dreaming if you
think you have time to hike.

32
00:05:11.772 --> 00:05:14.983
Well, I brought my backpack.

33
00:05:19.112 --> 00:05:20.947
You called about
international, right?

34
00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.383
- No charges?
- No. You don't need it.

35
00:05:22.407 --> 00:05:23.509
You don't need it.
Just use the WhatsApp.

36
00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:26.745
Josh, they're three and five.

37
00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:28.347
This is the first time
we've ever left them.

38
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:30.248
You want me to, what,
send them a heart emoji?

39
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.185
Okay, fine. We'll do it when...
When I get to the hotel.

40
00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:34.544
No, I want to call my kids now.

41
00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:37.130
Sofia, we're, like,
two minutes away.

42
00:05:37.172 --> 00:05:41.009
- I promised them I would.
- Can you just wait? Please?

43
00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.180
No.

44
00:05:54.272 --> 00:05:56.775
Sofia: I love you, too.

45
00:05:56.817 --> 00:05:59.986
Be good for grandma
and grandpa, all right?

46
00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:05.384
I love you. Bye.

47
00:06:05.408 --> 00:06:06.618
Let me talk...

48
00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:11.206
- Hey, we better check in.
- Marcos: Josh!

49
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:14.209
- Hey! There he is.
- Marcos.

50
00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:16.586
- It's good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you, man.

51
00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:20.225
I
can't thank you enough

52
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.418
for doing this last minute.

53
00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:22.424
Especially you, Sofia.

54
00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.881
I know you stopped your
practice when you had kids.

55
00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:27.241
Well, um, actually just
getting back, so this is good.

56
00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:30.100
Everybody I called before
you turned me down,

57
00:06:30.142 --> 00:06:33.603
so thanks for saving
my ass, really.

58
00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:36.398
Well, happy to help.

59
00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.233
And you are. You are.

60
00:06:38.275 --> 00:06:40.652
Colombia is in need for
more healthcare workers.

61
00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:42.696
Oh, yeah.

62
00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.825
Must feel good to be back, huh?

63
00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:50.829
Yeah, it's good to be here.

64
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:52.831
It's gonna be hard
to stay focused.

65
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:54.416
I mean, this is a...

66
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:55.852
This is a beautiful
country you have here, man.

67
00:06:55.876 --> 00:06:57.436
Well, I shifted your
schedules a little bit,

68
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.797
so your presentation
won't be until Friday.

69
00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.884
Great. Extra time to prepare.

70
00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.636
I thought you guys needed
a little alone time.

71
00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:08.918
I know you don't get away from
the kids that much, right?

72
00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:11.850
Thanks for thinking of us.

73
00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:13.435
You're still good
for dinner tonight?

74
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:16.062
Yeah, sure. 8:00.
Is that all right?

75
00:07:16.104 --> 00:07:17.647
Yeah. Awesome.

76
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.649
I'll see you then.
Good to see you, man.

77
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.070
Your passport.

78
00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:26.323
- Do you have it?
- No, I don't.

79
00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:31.703
- Why should I have it?
- Yeah. Okay.

80
00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:52.682
No,
this... it's my fault.

81
00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:54.726
Marcos booked the rooms
and I haven't told him yet.

82
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:02.108
Let me see.

83
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.127
You should
tell him before dinner.

84
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:05.904
Won't that be a bit awkward?

85
00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:07.697
Then tell him after.

86
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.699
You guys are closer
anyways, right?

87
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.380
It's a
pretty great room, right?

88
00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:29.761
Okay, I'm sure that they'll
have an extra cot or something.

89
00:08:29.803 --> 00:08:31.721
You heard her.

90
00:08:31.763 --> 00:08:33.932
The hotel is packed with
people for this conference.

91
00:08:33.974 --> 00:08:35.534
All right, fine. I'll
sleep right there.

92
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.435
- On the couch.
- No, I will.

93
00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:39.354
You know what?
Whatever you prefer.

94
00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:40.373
I don't know what
the big deal is.

95
00:08:40.397 --> 00:08:41.940
We just sat on an airplane

96
00:08:41.982 --> 00:08:43.525
for six hours right
next to each other.

97
00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:44.919
I just don't want to sleep
in the same room as you.

98
00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:47.153
I need space to work.

99
00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.155
Jesus, it's only for a few days.

100
00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:51.533
That's not the point.

101
00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:53.952
I mean, we haven't been under

102
00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:55.578
the same roof together
in, like, months,

103
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.956
so it's not gonna kill you.

104
00:08:57.998 --> 00:09:01.543
Could you please stop
talking? Thank you.

105
00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:02.961
I don't like it
either, all right?

106
00:09:03.003 --> 00:09:04.105
I'm just trying to
make the best of it.

107
00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:05.171
Yeah, just like you.

108
00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:06.190
Just trying to make the best

109
00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:07.257
of a bad situation, right?

110
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:11.177
If I'm such a fucking asshole,

111
00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:12.321
then why did you bother to come?

112
00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:13.805
Because I need this.

113
00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:19.561
Look...

114
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:20.955
I'll just be working
in the business center.

115
00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:22.981
- Whatever. Fine.
- Yeah, and also,

116
00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:25.608
I'll leave dinner early
tonight so you can tell Marcos.

117
00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:39.998
I wish I had been there.

118
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.208
You should have seen
your husband's face

119
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.169
when he realized he was stuck.

120
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.212
- I was not stuck.
- That's bullshit.

121
00:09:46.254 --> 00:09:49.549
No, no, no, no. Fine, I was...

122
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:50.884
I was choosing
not to go forward.

123
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:53.803
- Sounds the same to me.
- Okay, okay.

124
00:09:53.845 --> 00:09:57.057
I was stuck. But in my defense,
it was fucking pouring rain.

125
00:09:57.098 --> 00:10:00.852
- Where was this?
- Both: Uh, Brazil.

126
00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:03.897
It was, like, five years ago.

127
00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:08.151
Oh, yeah. Right
after Sadie was born.

128
00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:28.481
I hope
you guys don't mind.

129
00:10:28.505 --> 00:10:30.757
I ordered some Colombian food.

130
00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:32.425
It's very nice. It's
called mondongo.

131
00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:33.736
- You're gonna love it.
- Mondongo has meat, right?

132
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:35.804
There's meat in the...

133
00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:36.822
- Yeah, no, no.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

134
00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:38.848
I forgot to tell you,

135
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.101
Sofia is a vegetarian now.

136
00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:43.937
Really?

137
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:46.064
Since when?

138
00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:49.067
When I was pregnant with
Andy, with our first,

139
00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:51.444
I realized I couldn't eat
anything that had a mother.

140
00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:54.864
- Okay, I can respect that.
- Mm.

141
00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:56.282
I don't have a problem.

142
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:07.293
Josh: It's very
good. No, it's good.

143
00:11:09.045 --> 00:11:11.881
I love to do my research.
I've been digging around.

144
00:11:11.923 --> 00:11:14.092
Looks like a lot of pretty
awesome places to go hiking.

145
00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:15.760
It's too bad you're
all booked up.

146
00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:18.096
Well, I'm actually trying
to clear up my morning,

147
00:11:18.138 --> 00:11:22.892
so do you know this place
called Cascada la Chorrera?

148
00:11:22.934 --> 00:11:26.688
Josh: Uh, yeah. It's only
Colombia's highest waterfall.

149
00:11:26.729 --> 00:11:29.107
- It's a beautiful place.
- No, it's very beautiful.

150
00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:31.901
And it's very close. It's
in Choachi. Really close.

151
00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:34.112
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, I wanna go. Let's do it.

152
00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:36.698
Marcos: Hey, I noticed you
still have the same awful

153
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.700
- backpack you had in college.
- Oh, yeah.

154
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:40.243
The one strapped
with the duct tape.

155
00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:41.512
Careful. That's
my lucky backpack.

156
00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:42.888
Marcos: Well, it's
fucking terrible.

157
00:11:42.912 --> 00:11:45.331
- It's pretty awful.
- Marcos: Right?

158
00:11:45.373 --> 00:11:47.333
I hope you don't mind me
stealing your husband,

159
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.918
- but if you wanna come...
- No, no.

160
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.295
Sof wouldn't be into it.

161
00:11:52.172 --> 00:11:54.257
Really?

162
00:11:56.384 --> 00:11:58.136
Not really your thing, is it?

163
00:11:58.178 --> 00:12:00.972
I love hiking. We
used to do it a lot.

164
00:12:01.014 --> 00:12:04.642
Sof, you haven't been
hiking in, like, ten years?

165
00:12:04.684 --> 00:12:07.562
So what? It doesn't mean
I stopped enjoying it.

166
00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:09.165
It must be hard to hike
with the little ones

167
00:12:09.189 --> 00:12:12.942
- strapped to your back.
- Exactly.

168
00:12:12.984 --> 00:12:16.362
But you know what?
I should pass.

169
00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:19.657
Not because I don't like
it or I don't enjoy it,

170
00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:22.744
but because I have a lot of
prep to do before Friday.

171
00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:25.163
I'm telling you, you're
going to do great.

172
00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:26.748
I don't know about
this guy, but...

173
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:29.375
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
do the same presentation

174
00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:31.294
I've been doing for
years, so I'll be fine.

175
00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:33.421
Actually, I should head to bed.

176
00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:37.967
Bye, guys.

177
00:12:44.098 --> 00:12:45.183
Did I say something wrong?

178
00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:48.186
No, no. It's not you.

179
00:12:48.228 --> 00:12:52.607
I was gonna tell you earlier.
I should have, probably.

180
00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:55.985
Sofia and I have decided
that we're gonna split up.

181
00:12:57.737 --> 00:13:00.657
What? When?

182
00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:06.037
It's fairly recent, so...

183
00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:13.920
Wow. You guys are
the perfect couple.

184
00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:18.675
Yeah.

185
00:13:20.468 --> 00:13:21.886
Are you seeing someone else?

186
00:13:23.263 --> 00:13:25.265
It's not that. It's just, um...

187
00:13:30.061 --> 00:13:33.147
We've changed and we'll
be better off apart.

188
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.738
I don't know what to say.

189
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.451
Say, "Josh, what time
am I picking you up

190
00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:48.079
so we can go hiking
tomorrow morning?"

191
00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:53.084
Okay.

192
00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:57.297
Cheers.

193
00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:41.567
Sofia: Why aren't you dressed?

194
00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:46.781
Oh, Marcos couldn't get free.

195
00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:48.574
Oh. Okay.

196
00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:51.369
I think I wanna go.

197
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.871
- To?
- Choachi.

198
00:15:53.913 --> 00:15:58.376
I don't get many chances to
do stuff like this, so, yeah.

199
00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:00.795
Are you gonna go by yourself?

200
00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:03.131
Who else would I go with?

201
00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:05.967
Come on, Sofia.

202
00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:07.427
I'll be back tonight.

203
00:16:09.762 --> 00:16:11.514
I... I can go with you.

204
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:13.391
I'll be fine on my own.

205
00:16:13.433 --> 00:16:15.184
I know I'm the last person

206
00:16:15.226 --> 00:16:18.229
that you wanna be around
right now, but come on.

207
00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:20.857
It's not safe to go hiking
around here by yourself.

208
00:16:24.402 --> 00:16:25.403
Okay.

209
00:16:27.613 --> 00:16:28.573
Okay?

210
00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:31.743
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

211
00:16:56.893 --> 00:16:58.495
- Okay.
- Josh: No, no, no, wait.

212
00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:00.146
Is this the only road?

213
00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:01.790
Because, I mean, that's
gonna take us hours, right?

214
00:17:01.814 --> 00:17:03.667
Sofia: Well, looks like if
we drove through this area,

215
00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.402
- we'll get there faster?
- Pedro: No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:17:06.444 --> 00:17:09.989
That's Las Arenas.
It's not a safe place.

217
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:12.033
What's Las Arenas?
I've never heard of it.

218
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:14.702
It's north of Choachi,
close to the water.

219
00:17:14.744 --> 00:17:19.290
Even locals won't go there.
It's quite dangerous.

220
00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:21.375
I'm a pretty
experienced hiker, so...

221
00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:26.047
Um, wildlife there is dangerous.

222
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.591
Particularly
snakes. Big snakes.

223
00:17:28.633 --> 00:17:31.677
Snakes? I'm Colombian.

224
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:34.388
I don't remember snakes
being in cold mountains.

225
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.057
Times have changed.

226
00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:38.893
As climate gets warmer, you
have new species coming in.

227
00:17:38.935 --> 00:17:40.895
Not to talk about the erosion.

228
00:17:40.937 --> 00:17:43.272
You see, the land
is not very steady.

229
00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:48.903
You have steep ravines,
unsteady ground.

230
00:17:48.945 --> 00:17:50.506
- We'll avoid it, then.
- No, no, no, I mean,

231
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.799
the other way,
it'll save us time.

232
00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:56.077
- No way. I hate snakes.
- She's right.

233
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:59.080
Las Arenas is not a place
you want to find yourself.

234
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:07.547
Would you help me
with this, please?

235
00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:10.550
Thank you.

236
00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:06.786
This altitude is no joke.

237
00:22:07.787 --> 00:22:11.123
- Here.
- Thanks.

238
00:22:11.165 --> 00:22:13.375
Thank you for waiting for me.

239
00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:19.090
I had a cramp.

240
00:22:23.219 --> 00:22:24.220
Okay.

241
00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:30.392
Oh, shit.

242
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:34.980
Ah, that's not good. Fuck.

243
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:36.524
Babe, we gotta turn back.

244
00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:38.359
We're not going back.

245
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.362
We're so close. You
really wanna cut it short?

246
00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.781
No, I don't want
to cut it short.

247
00:22:43.823 --> 00:22:45.592
But I definitely don't
want to get caught in that.

248
00:22:45.616 --> 00:22:47.827
Come on. We gotta
go. Trust me.

249
00:22:51.122 --> 00:22:52.162
We gotta go.

250
00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:56.836
- Okay.
- Come on, we gotta walk fast.

251
00:22:58.045 --> 00:22:59.255
Thanks.

252
00:23:41.088 --> 00:23:45.551
Oh, shit. Shit. He's
breaking into the car.

253
00:23:45.593 --> 00:23:47.970
- I'll go talk to him.
- No. What are you doing?

254
00:23:48.012 --> 00:23:50.222
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

255
00:23:50.264 --> 00:23:52.016
Please, stay put
until he leaves.

256
00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:54.852
- What if he steals the car?
- You're not going out there.

257
00:23:54.894 --> 00:23:57.271
- I'm just gonna scare him off.
- Hey, he's not a pigeon.

258
00:23:57.313 --> 00:23:59.857
- You don't know what he'll do.
- Yeah, well... listen.

259
00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:02.860
Shh! Look, I am not
getting stuck here.

260
00:24:02.902 --> 00:24:04.862
- Please.
- No. Shh.

261
00:24:04.904 --> 00:24:06.197
Please, please.

262
00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:08.282
Stay hidden, stay out of sight.

263
00:24:08.324 --> 00:24:10.326
I've got this. Just back off.

264
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.330
Josh: Hey!

265
00:24:16.123 --> 00:24:17.883
Can I
help you with something?

266
00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:20.669
Whoa. Oh! Whoa, whoa.

267
00:24:22.922 --> 00:24:26.967
No have money.

268
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.223
No wallet.

269
00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:38.729
Yeah. Okay.

270
00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:54.161
She
left. It's only me.

271
00:24:54.203 --> 00:24:55.788
It's only me.

272
00:25:01.085 --> 00:25:02.145
What are you doing?

273
00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:04.296
Shh!

274
00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:19.395
Run! Run!

275
00:25:26.986 --> 00:25:28.112
Josh: Go!

276
00:25:36.912 --> 00:25:40.207
Go, go go!

277
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:47.047
Are you okay?

278
00:25:47.089 --> 00:25:49.174
We should go that way,
where no one goes.

279
00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:50.968
Las Arenas. He
won't follow us.

280
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.886
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

281
00:25:52.928 --> 00:25:54.763
Do you think he's gone?

282
00:25:54.805 --> 00:25:56.890
Fuck, I don't know.

283
00:25:56.932 --> 00:25:59.184
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Okay, listen.

284
00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:01.562
Listen to me.
We'll do your plan.

285
00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:03.415
We'll go to Las Arenas and
we'll wait out the storm.

286
00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:04.815
All right? Come on.

287
00:26:04.857 --> 00:26:06.275
Come on!

288
00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:08.819
What?

289
00:26:10.946 --> 00:26:13.574
- You had to be the hero.
- So this is my fucking fault?

290
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.343
You always think you can talk
yourself out of everything.

291
00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:16.678
How was I supposed to
know that he had a gun?

292
00:26:16.702 --> 00:26:18.203
If you had stayed
put as I told you,

293
00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:19.347
none of this would
have happened!

294
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:20.581
You are un-fucking-believable!

295
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:22.624
Just run!

296
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:26.628
Run, Sof! Run! Go!

297
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:39.076
Sofia: Josh.

298
00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.331
Josh.

299
00:27:51.422 --> 00:27:52.423
Josh?

300
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:03.142
Josh!

301
00:28:11.942 --> 00:28:12.943
Josh!

302
00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:29.168
Josh!

303
00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:40.971
Fuck!

304
00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:50.439
Help!

305
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.116
Sofia!

306
00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:06.538
- Sofia!
- Josh! Josh!

307
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.917
Josh! Josh! Josh!

308
00:29:09.958 --> 00:29:11.585
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

309
00:29:11.627 --> 00:29:12.836
Stop, stop!

310
00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:15.380
Calm... calm down, okay?

311
00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:16.965
Try and move to my hand.

312
00:29:17.007 --> 00:29:19.927
- It's too thick.
- Baby, you gotta try, okay?

313
00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.971
- I can't! I'm stuck!
- Okay, just hang on.

314
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:25.390
Hang on. Hang on.

315
00:29:25.432 --> 00:29:27.059
I can't even stick out my arms!

316
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.060
Hold on!

317
00:29:32.022 --> 00:29:34.399
Wait, okay?

318
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.985
Try to reach it, okay?

319
00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:39.196
Come on, baby! You can do it!

320
00:29:39.238 --> 00:29:42.991
Try, babe. Come on.

321
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:45.410
Get it.

322
00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:47.204
Ah, fuck! Okay, wait.

323
00:29:47.246 --> 00:29:49.289
Wait.

324
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:51.041
Hold on, okay?

325
00:29:53.043 --> 00:29:54.169
Just stay calm, okay?

326
00:29:56.672 --> 00:29:58.507
No, no! Don't!

327
00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.717
Stop moving! Stop
moving! Don't move!

328
00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:03.762
Stop moving! Sofia!

329
00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:17.943
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

330
00:30:17.985 --> 00:30:21.905
Come on, come on. I
got you. I got you.

331
00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:27.452
Come on, come on. Come on!

332
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:30.664
I got you. I got
you! Okay? I got you.

333
00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:33.041
I got you. I got you.

334
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:35.460
I got you. I got you.

335
00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:37.671
- It's okay. It's okay.
- What... what did you...

336
00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:39.464
Shh, shh, shh. Just stay calm.

337
00:30:39.506 --> 00:30:42.259
- But why... why are you here?
- No, no, no. Stay calm.

338
00:30:42.301 --> 00:30:44.386
I don't... don't move,
okay? Don't move.

339
00:30:44.428 --> 00:30:47.681
We both need to be
perfectly still, okay?

340
00:30:47.723 --> 00:30:49.308
You should've...

341
00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:54.062
I think...

342
00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:56.440
I think this is like quicksand.

343
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.324
Josh, you there?
I got free early.

344
00:31:10.912 --> 00:31:11.913
Josh?

345
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:26.219
Marcos, buddy,

346
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:28.889
I know we were gonna
meet up later, but, uh,

347
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.392
Sofia and I are gonna
actually go hiking in Choachi,

348
00:31:32.434 --> 00:31:35.312
so we probably won't
be back till late,

349
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:38.774
and I guess I'll see you
tomorrow, man. Cheers.

350
00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:41.943
Okay.

351
00:31:49.576 --> 00:31:52.829
Josh: At least it
stopped raining.

352
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.931
Sofia: I think I
moved a little.

353
00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:54.932
- Josh: No, you didn't.
- Look!

354
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.917
Josh: You didn't, honey.

355
00:31:56.958 --> 00:32:00.003
I need... I
need to look at your head.

356
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:01.922
- Come on.
- It's fine.

357
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:03.340
Baby, let me look at your head.

358
00:32:03.382 --> 00:32:05.175
We just need to get out of this.

359
00:32:12.182 --> 00:32:14.142
God, isn't it crazy
that we're stuck?

360
00:32:14.184 --> 00:32:15.894
Well, I wouldn't
worry too much, okay?

361
00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:20.691
I've never heard of anybody
fucking dying in quicksand.

362
00:32:23.402 --> 00:32:25.570
Won't it suck us down?

363
00:32:25.612 --> 00:32:28.365
No, it doesn't work that way.

364
00:32:28.407 --> 00:32:30.784
The weight of the mud,

365
00:32:30.826 --> 00:32:33.787
its density is... it's
heavier than the human body.

366
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:37.040
- How the fuck do you know that?
- The guidebook.

367
00:32:37.082 --> 00:32:41.378
It says water, it flows
in and it gets trapped

368
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.589
underneath the dirt and
it creates this fucking

369
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.591
heavy as shit mud.

370
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.969
- How far down does it go?
- I don't know.

371
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.222
Didn't the guidebook tell
you how to get out of this?

372
00:32:56.226 --> 00:32:57.644
No.

373
00:33:00.439 --> 00:33:03.316
Okay, just give me... Give
me a second here, okay?

374
00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:05.819
I'm gonna try to go backward.

375
00:33:05.861 --> 00:33:08.405
Just push me. Just... no.

376
00:33:08.447 --> 00:33:11.116
Don't do that. No, I
just... Just... I just...

377
00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:15.620
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I can't move, man.

378
00:33:15.662 --> 00:33:16.997
Look over there.

379
00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:19.416
Josh: Where did
that come from?

380
00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:22.794
I think I knocked it
loose when I was falling.

381
00:33:22.836 --> 00:33:26.006
See how it is resting
over the surface?

382
00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:28.592
Maybe I can spread out my
body weight so I won't sink.

383
00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.636
- Try to push me over the edge.
- Sof.

384
00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:32.971
Try to push me over the edge.

385
00:33:33.013 --> 00:33:34.031
We can't even move
our fucking legs.

386
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:35.640
Please.

387
00:33:35.682 --> 00:33:37.242
- Just try.
- What do you want me to do?

388
00:33:37.267 --> 00:33:38.643
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

389
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:41.104
- Stay put.
- Okay. Wait. Just wait.

390
00:33:41.146 --> 00:33:43.273
Let me get this hand
fucking down there.

391
00:33:43.315 --> 00:33:46.568
Give me a... I can grab you.
Just... just wait. Wait.

392
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.035
No, fuck it. Just
hold on. Fuck.

393
00:33:55.076 --> 00:33:57.662
It's not working. It's
not gonna work. Just wait.

394
00:33:57.704 --> 00:34:00.248
Try to take off my boot.

395
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.708
Let me try.

396
00:34:03.502 --> 00:34:05.420
- Fuck.
- What?

397
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:11.259
- There's something down here.
- What?

398
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:12.904
- What? What do you mean?
- There's something down here.

399
00:34:12.928 --> 00:34:14.655
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what it is.

400
00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.282
- Oh, shit. Okay, I'll...
- Let's try to pull it.

401
00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:18.683
- At three. Together, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

402
00:34:18.725 --> 00:34:21.269
- One, two, three.
- Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:34:26.316 --> 00:34:28.276
Fuck! Fuck!

404
00:34:28.318 --> 00:34:30.737
- Fuck!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

405
00:34:35.116 --> 00:34:37.077
- Look at his skin.
- Yeah.

406
00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:39.621
The tissue degradation
on his face.

407
00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:43.083
He starved to death.

408
00:34:43.124 --> 00:34:45.168
Fuck.

409
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.295
Okay, okay.

410
00:34:47.337 --> 00:34:49.089
Baby.

411
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.092
I'm gonna try to get
his pack off, all right?

412
00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:53.927
I got his pack.

413
00:35:02.978 --> 00:35:05.856
Let me help. Let me help.

414
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.529
I can't stand this.

415
00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:15.365
We should put him
back. Help me.

416
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:19.578
Hang on.

417
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.382
Let's see what he's got.

418
00:35:53.028 --> 00:35:54.029
Look.

419
00:35:57.866 --> 00:36:02.203
- There's a knife.
- Okay.

420
00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:07.626
Oh, yeah.

421
00:36:10.837 --> 00:36:13.214
Some light reading material.

422
00:36:15.008 --> 00:36:17.385
What was he out here hunting?

423
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.638
I don't think we wanna know.

424
00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:27.646
Two shells left.

425
00:36:29.856 --> 00:36:31.191
Why didn't he just kill himself?

426
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:38.281
- Brutal way to die.
- Yeah. Okay.

427
00:36:38.323 --> 00:36:41.451
The way I see it, we only
got two ways out of here.

428
00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:44.204
Either someone pulls us out.

429
00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:46.623
No one knows we're
here, Josh! No one!

430
00:36:46.665 --> 00:36:50.710
Okay! So we got to
pull ourselves out.

431
00:36:50.752 --> 00:36:54.673
- How?
- Look behind me.

432
00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:57.676
You see that tree
stump and that rock?

433
00:36:58.885 --> 00:37:01.471
What about it?

434
00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:04.307
They look strong enough
to hold your weight.

435
00:37:06.017 --> 00:37:08.645
- It's fucking far away.
- Yeah.

436
00:37:08.687 --> 00:37:10.480
So...

437
00:37:14.693 --> 00:37:18.571
we cut this backpack into strips

438
00:37:18.613 --> 00:37:20.448
and we tie it together.

439
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.077
It's cotton canvas.

440
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:26.663
It should hold.

441
00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:29.624
- You're gonna lasso that rock?
- No.

442
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.128
You are.

443
00:37:35.505 --> 00:37:38.008
I'm not sure I can do it.

444
00:37:38.049 --> 00:37:39.926
Sof, it's our only
fucking chance.

445
00:37:42.137 --> 00:37:44.264
Help me.

446
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:47.726
I'll hold the bag, you cut.
Watch your fucking fingers.

447
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.730
Yeah.

448
00:37:53.523 --> 00:37:54.959
Cut. Watch your fingers.
Watch your fingers.

449
00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:58.486
Josh: Wait.

450
00:37:58.528 --> 00:38:00.947
Wait one sec. One
sec, one sec, one sec.

451
00:38:03.158 --> 00:38:05.326
Come on. Watch your
fingers. Here, here.

452
00:38:06.953 --> 00:38:08.663
Here. Okay.

453
00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:20.777
Okay. That's that.

454
00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:22.987
Do you think it'll be enough?

455
00:39:23.029 --> 00:39:25.240
We'll see.

456
00:39:28.827 --> 00:39:30.995
Remember that
conference in Texas?

457
00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:35.583
I was just thinking about that.

458
00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:38.002
We were about to take
that rodeo lesson.

459
00:39:38.044 --> 00:39:40.797
- You got food poisoning.
- Yeah.

460
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:43.299
Who orders twenty oysters
in a restaurant in Texas?

461
00:39:43.341 --> 00:39:44.676
I don't know.

462
00:39:44.717 --> 00:39:46.845
A lasso would have
come in handy then.

463
00:39:49.055 --> 00:39:50.431
Hey.

464
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.354
You got this.

465
00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:00.066
I'll do my best.

466
00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:07.615
Okay. You got it. You got it.

467
00:40:07.657 --> 00:40:10.034
Here, just wait.
Let me hold this up.

468
00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:12.620
I can just... pull
this stuff up.

469
00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:14.414
Okay. Go.

470
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.433
How short are we?

471
00:40:33.474 --> 00:40:35.643
- I think eight feet or so.
- Fuck.

472
00:40:35.685 --> 00:40:39.189
Maybe if we cut the straps,
we can make it longer.

473
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.708
No, no. I made them
this thick for a reason.

474
00:40:40.732 --> 00:40:42.901
Need to make sure
they don't break.

475
00:40:45.278 --> 00:40:47.655
Okay, wait.

476
00:40:47.697 --> 00:40:50.450
I'll take off my jacket.
We'll use my jacket.

477
00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:51.886
- Are you able to do it?
- Yeah, I can do it.

478
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.661
- I'll do the same.
- No. No.

479
00:40:53.703 --> 00:40:55.288
Sof, you gotta keep
yours on, okay?

480
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.665
- You'll freeze to death.
- We need more than one.

481
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.919
What then?

482
00:41:08.343 --> 00:41:10.345
Marcos. Marcos will come.

483
00:41:12.722 --> 00:41:13.848
He'll find us.

484
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.309
We just said it.

485
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:18.311
They don't have a
clue where we are.

486
00:41:18.353 --> 00:41:19.914
But in the morning,
when we're not there,

487
00:41:19.938 --> 00:41:22.690
- he'll know something's up.
- And then do what?

488
00:41:22.732 --> 00:41:24.543
And then he'll fucking...
He'll call the police.

489
00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:26.527
They'll send out a search party.

490
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:29.113
Do you know how big
is this rainforest?

491
00:41:29.155 --> 00:41:31.008
Marcos thinks we are, like,
an hour away from this.

492
00:41:31.032 --> 00:41:32.408
That is not the point.

493
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.494
The point is people
will be looking for us.

494
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:55.932
Josh! Look!

495
00:41:55.974 --> 00:41:59.352
Hey! Hey, we're here!

496
00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:02.146
- Hey!
- We're here!

497
00:42:02.188 --> 00:42:04.440
- Josh: Hey, hey!
- Hey!

498
00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:08.403
It's one of those
sight-seeing tours. Hey!

499
00:42:08.444 --> 00:42:09.654
Sofia: Hey!

500
00:42:09.696 --> 00:42:10.947
Josh: Fuck, they can't see us.

501
00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:12.740
Hey! Hey!

502
00:42:12.782 --> 00:42:15.159
The whole point of that
tour is to look down.

503
00:42:15.201 --> 00:42:16.160
They could see us.

504
00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:17.745
The trees are too fucking thick.

505
00:42:17.787 --> 00:42:21.958
Hey! Hey!

506
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.211
Hey! Hey!

507
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:29.966
What are you doing?

508
00:42:30.008 --> 00:42:33.761
They will see the
fire or the smoke.

509
00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:36.389
- Sofia, it's not gonna work.
- Yes, it's gonna work.

510
00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:37.950
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it's gonna work!

511
00:42:37.974 --> 00:42:40.560
- Honey. Honey.
- Fuck.

512
00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:42.562
It's not gonna catch on
fire. It's not gonna work.

513
00:42:42.603 --> 00:42:44.314
- It's gonna work.
- You would need a stack

514
00:42:44.355 --> 00:42:46.107
of dry Bibles to
catch on fire, okay?

515
00:42:46.149 --> 00:42:47.775
There's not gonna
be any fucking fire.

516
00:42:47.817 --> 00:42:49.003
This is the only thing we have.

517
00:42:49.027 --> 00:42:51.112
I told you.

518
00:42:51.154 --> 00:42:52.155
It's not gonna work.

519
00:42:56.617 --> 00:42:59.412
No, no, no, no, stop. Stop!

520
00:42:59.454 --> 00:43:00.913
- We need to make real fire!
- No!

521
00:43:00.955 --> 00:43:03.416
- Let me do it! Let me do it!
- No!

522
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:06.210
If you burn this and
they don't see it,

523
00:43:06.252 --> 00:43:07.503
it's all we fucking have!

524
00:43:07.545 --> 00:43:09.422
We don't have anything anyways.

525
00:43:09.464 --> 00:43:10.524
Let me! We're gonna
lose our chance...

526
00:43:10.548 --> 00:43:12.175
You're not gonna
fucking burn it!

527
00:43:12.216 --> 00:43:15.845
You're not fucking burning
it! You're not burning it!

528
00:43:15.887 --> 00:43:17.513
You're not fucking burning it.

529
00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:24.228
We just fucked up our chance.

530
00:43:26.064 --> 00:43:28.649
Someone's gonna find us.

531
00:44:12.527 --> 00:44:15.696
Do you have any granola bar
in your pocket by any chance?

532
00:44:15.738 --> 00:44:18.699
All the food, the water,
it's all in my backpack.

533
00:44:20.326 --> 00:44:24.288
We're gonna get dehydrated.

534
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:28.084
You don't know that.
You don't know...

535
00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:31.295
By this time
tomorrow we might be

536
00:44:31.337 --> 00:44:33.673
in the dining room at the hotel,

537
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:37.176
having lunch, laughing
about all this with Marcos.

538
00:44:38.928 --> 00:44:40.847
- I don't think so.
- I'm just...

539
00:44:40.888 --> 00:44:43.891
I'm trying to stay positive.

540
00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:46.894
Fuck. It's early!

541
00:44:46.936 --> 00:44:51.149
We might get back tonight
in time for dinner.

542
00:44:54.735 --> 00:44:58.322
Could you please stop talking
about dinner and breakfast?

543
00:44:58.364 --> 00:45:02.326
I just don't want to
be reminded. Thank you.

544
00:45:02.368 --> 00:45:04.078
You're the one
who brought it up!

545
00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.581
It's true.

546
00:45:15.173 --> 00:45:18.009
Ouch! Ow, ow! Ouch, ouch!

547
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.344
- What's wrong?
- Something bit me.

548
00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:22.263
- What?
- Ouch! It's killing me.

549
00:45:22.305 --> 00:45:25.183
- Help me! Help me!
- I can't... I can't reach you.

550
00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:27.101
It's ants. Fucking
swipe them away.

551
00:45:27.143 --> 00:45:28.454
- Help me. What...
- I can't fucking reach you.

552
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:30.313
- What is... the fuck?
- Ants. Ants.

553
00:45:30.354 --> 00:45:32.690
Wait, wait, wait. Just
give me a second. Hang on.

554
00:45:32.732 --> 00:45:34.150
Hang on. I got something.

555
00:45:34.192 --> 00:45:37.069
Okay. Here, use this,
use this, use this.

556
00:45:37.111 --> 00:45:39.572
The alcohol acts as a repellent.
Yes. Yeah, it's working.

557
00:45:39.614 --> 00:45:41.383
Your neck, your neck, your
neck. Your fucking neck.

558
00:45:41.407 --> 00:45:42.968
Over there, over there.
Right there, right there.

559
00:45:42.992 --> 00:45:44.577
- Right there. It's working.
- Fuck.

560
00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:46.579
- Oh, it's burning.
- Yeah, yeah. In the back.

561
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:48.956
- In the back. In the back.
- Oh, it's burning. Oh!

562
00:45:48.998 --> 00:45:51.000
It worked. It's working.
It worked, baby.

563
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:53.377
Okay. Okay. Oh, babe.

564
00:45:53.419 --> 00:45:56.506
Baby, baby. Baby, baby, baby.

565
00:45:56.547 --> 00:45:59.550
No, I still feel them.
I still feel them.

566
00:45:59.592 --> 00:46:01.928
- No, no, they're gone. Hon.
- Ow, fuck.

567
00:46:01.969 --> 00:46:04.597
Sof, they're gone, baby.
You're okay. You're okay.

568
00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:07.058
We got them. We got them.
You're okay. They're gone.

569
00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:08.100
They're gone.

570
00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:24.367
You have been
carrying this around?

571
00:46:24.408 --> 00:46:26.661
I had it tucked away.

572
00:46:29.038 --> 00:46:30.456
In your underwear?

573
00:46:33.668 --> 00:46:36.254
I didn't... I didn't
want you to see it.

574
00:46:38.047 --> 00:46:42.593
You don't have a granola
bar, but you have vodka.

575
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:54.480
You were sober for so long.

576
00:46:57.275 --> 00:46:58.901
Or at least I thought that.

577
00:47:02.321 --> 00:47:04.073
- When did you start again?
- I don't know.

578
00:47:05.366 --> 00:47:07.076
I don't know.

579
00:47:09.078 --> 00:47:12.373
It's... it's, um...

580
00:47:12.415 --> 00:47:13.416
it's been a while.

581
00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:18.629
Have you been drinking
at the hospital?

582
00:47:18.671 --> 00:47:21.841
No. No. Sofia, no.

583
00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:23.301
You know I'd never do that.

584
00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:24.885
Then why?

585
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:28.723
I've been under a lot of stress.

586
00:47:31.892 --> 00:47:32.893
The work.

587
00:47:36.105 --> 00:47:37.398
With us.

588
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.485
- Us?
- Yeah. Getting divorced sucks.

589
00:47:41.527 --> 00:47:44.530
Trust me. I know, too.

590
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:53.080
But, you know, we're
miserable, right?

591
00:47:53.122 --> 00:47:56.542
We just walk around
like fucking strangers.

592
00:48:02.548 --> 00:48:04.759
Strangers would
have been better.

593
00:48:08.137 --> 00:48:09.138
You and me...

594
00:48:13.184 --> 00:48:14.769
we didn't even like each other.

595
00:48:32.578 --> 00:48:34.455
Why didn't we use the rifle?

596
00:48:34.497 --> 00:48:37.249
What?

597
00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:41.253
Why didn't we shoot it to get
the helicopter's attention?

598
00:48:51.055 --> 00:48:52.640
Hand it to me.

599
00:48:53.974 --> 00:48:55.184
What?

600
00:48:57.812 --> 00:48:59.063
Please.

601
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:22.002
Just be very
careful. It's loaded.

602
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:26.507
Sofia: We just need
eight more feet.

603
00:49:28.217 --> 00:49:30.136
Think it'll hold?

604
00:49:30.177 --> 00:49:33.055
- It's about two feet.
- Who cares?

605
00:49:33.097 --> 00:49:34.390
It's not gonna be long enough.

606
00:49:34.432 --> 00:49:35.975
Sofia: At least I'm trying.

607
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:37.601
- It's something.
- We need to accept

608
00:49:37.643 --> 00:49:41.021
that we're gonna be
here for a long while,

609
00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:43.983
- maybe even days.
- Not if we get creative.

610
00:49:44.024 --> 00:49:45.693
Marcos will notice
that we're missing.

611
00:49:45.735 --> 00:49:49.196
- We can't rely on him.
- Yes, we can.

612
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.663
We just need to find a way to...

613
00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:04.420
Fuck. Fuck!

614
00:50:04.462 --> 00:50:07.256
Josh! Fuck! A snake!

615
00:50:11.552 --> 00:50:13.596
It can't come on this
quicksand, right?

616
00:50:16.474 --> 00:50:18.017
Listen to me. Listen to me.

617
00:50:18.058 --> 00:50:20.644
Shh. Don't move.

618
00:50:20.686 --> 00:50:24.440
It's defending its young.

619
00:50:24.482 --> 00:50:27.401
The egg. I knocked it out.

620
00:50:31.697 --> 00:50:32.865
Is it venomous?

621
00:50:35.284 --> 00:50:37.495
- Fuck, probably.
- Fuck.

622
00:50:37.536 --> 00:50:39.872
Josh: Okay, we can't
let it bite us,

623
00:50:39.914 --> 00:50:41.266
so pick up the gun.
Pick up the gun.

624
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.375
Pick up the gun.
Honey, pick up the gun.

625
00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:46.045
I've never used one before.

626
00:50:46.086 --> 00:50:49.465
You can do this. Pick it up
now. Pick it up now, all right?

627
00:50:49.507 --> 00:50:51.967
You got it.

628
00:50:52.009 --> 00:50:53.886
Baby, you can do it.

629
00:50:53.928 --> 00:50:55.679
It's a shotgun.
It's got a big kick,

630
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:57.491
but the good news is
whatever you point it at,

631
00:50:57.515 --> 00:50:58.808
you're probably gonna kill it.

632
00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:00.351
Come on. Honey, honey?

633
00:51:07.316 --> 00:51:09.109
Let me see.

634
00:51:10.402 --> 00:51:12.279
Josh: This is
bad. This is bad.

635
00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:16.283
Oh, God, it's bad.
It's bad. It is bad.

636
00:51:16.325 --> 00:51:17.910
I need to slow down the venom.

637
00:51:17.952 --> 00:51:19.328
We need every inch of the rope.

638
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.997
No, no, no. I need
you to shut up, okay?

639
00:51:22.039 --> 00:51:25.167
I need your heart rate to
stay as low as possible.

640
00:51:25.209 --> 00:51:27.545
Ah! Jesus!

641
00:51:29.672 --> 00:51:31.924
Okay, we know... we know...

642
00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:34.093
We both know how
this goes, okay?

643
00:51:34.134 --> 00:51:35.928
The venom attacks
the cells, yeah?

644
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.097
Then it attacks the organs.

645
00:51:38.138 --> 00:51:39.807
Okay, my organs are
going to shut down.

646
00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:41.392
I need to get to a hospital.

647
00:51:41.433 --> 00:51:46.313
No, no. So, look at me.
Calm down. All right?

648
00:51:46.355 --> 00:51:48.315
We still have time.
We still have time.

649
00:51:48.357 --> 00:51:50.609
- We don't.
- Six hours. Maybe more.

650
00:51:52.778 --> 00:51:54.947
I'm gonna be in a
fuckload of pain, baby.

651
00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:57.533
I'm gonna be in a
fuckload of pain.

652
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:17.136
Hey.
Hey, look at me.

653
00:52:17.177 --> 00:52:18.804
Are my friends alive?

654
00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:25.352
Do you want money?

655
00:52:26.186 --> 00:52:28.022
I've got 200 dollars.
If you want them,

656
00:52:28.063 --> 00:52:30.065
they are yours but
tell me where they are.

657
00:52:31.817 --> 00:52:33.986
Hand them over.

658
00:52:34.028 --> 00:52:35.779
They are upstairs in my bag.

659
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.781
When we get out of here

660
00:52:37.823 --> 00:52:39.593
I'll tell the police this
was all a misunderstanding,

661
00:52:39.617 --> 00:52:41.869
I made a mistake and then
I give you the money.

662
00:52:45.623 --> 00:52:47.041
Give me that watch.

663
00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:55.841
It was my dad's.

664
00:52:55.883 --> 00:52:58.844
Then don't give me anything.

665
00:53:05.434 --> 00:53:07.353
This is worth a lot, you
better start talking.

666
00:53:14.234 --> 00:53:19.490
A week ago, I was
hunting snakes.

667
00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:25.621
- Snakes?
- Yes.

668
00:53:25.663 --> 00:53:29.124
Venom is well paid. Skins too,

669
00:53:29.166 --> 00:53:33.837
- I was at Las Arenas.
- Is that where they are?

670
00:53:35.255 --> 00:53:37.049
That's where I saw them.

671
00:53:37.091 --> 00:53:39.635
But they are alright.

672
00:53:39.677 --> 00:53:43.055
Do you know why they
call it Las Arenas?

673
00:53:43.097 --> 00:53:45.557
That place is called Las Arenas

674
00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.101
because there's a
lot of quicksands,

675
00:53:47.142 --> 00:53:52.147
There's no quicksand in this
country; that's bullshit.

676
00:53:54.692 --> 00:53:59.071
Did you know I went hunting with
a friend, but I came back alone.

677
00:53:59.113 --> 00:54:01.865
If you don't want to believe
me, it's your problem,

678
00:54:01.907 --> 00:54:04.243
but they are in danger.

679
00:54:12.918 --> 00:54:16.463
Hey, buddy, I'm a doctor.

680
00:54:16.505 --> 00:54:19.425
I organized the conference
here. Let me out.

681
00:54:19.466 --> 00:54:22.886
I mean it; My friends
are in danger.

682
00:54:22.928 --> 00:54:26.015
If you want, call the manager.

683
00:54:26.056 --> 00:54:28.058
Let me out!

684
00:54:31.145 --> 00:54:34.106
Josh: Fuck!

685
00:54:34.148 --> 00:54:36.900
I won't calm down.

686
00:54:36.942 --> 00:54:40.612
I won't fucking calm down
'cause is fucking bullshit!

687
00:54:40.654 --> 00:54:43.490
- Just try. Try to relax!
- All we did was go on a hike!

688
00:54:43.532 --> 00:54:49.371
And now we're stuck in
fucking... Fucking quicksand!

689
00:54:49.413 --> 00:54:52.124
But just try to
relax, all right?

690
00:54:52.166 --> 00:54:55.127
Fuck this fucking...

691
00:54:56.879 --> 00:54:59.631
fucking place.

692
00:54:59.673 --> 00:55:03.135
Josh, the faster
your heart rate,

693
00:55:03.177 --> 00:55:05.971
the faster the venom
spreads, remember? Right?

694
00:55:06.013 --> 00:55:08.307
Mm-hmm.

695
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:09.975
All right. Okay.

696
00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:14.354
Isn't that amazing?

697
00:55:16.774 --> 00:55:21.737
One minute I'm at a fucking
golf course with my buddies.

698
00:55:21.779 --> 00:55:24.740
My phone rings. It's
Marcos. He's like,

699
00:55:24.782 --> 00:55:29.161
"Hey, Josh, man,

700
00:55:29.203 --> 00:55:32.164
think Sof can join us in
Colombia for the conference?"

701
00:55:32.206 --> 00:55:35.167
Now look at us. We're
here in beautiful Bogota.

702
00:55:35.209 --> 00:55:37.753
I just got...

703
00:55:37.795 --> 00:55:42.549
I just got bitten by a
fucking giant venomous snake.

704
00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:45.719
- Stop. Stop.
- Fuck. Fuck.

705
00:55:45.761 --> 00:55:49.765
- Fuck.
- Let me see your arm.

706
00:55:49.807 --> 00:55:52.684
It's no use. Okay?

707
00:55:52.726 --> 00:55:53.977
It'll be no different than

708
00:55:54.019 --> 00:55:56.188
the last time you
looked at it, honey.

709
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:59.983
Honey, honey.

710
00:56:00.025 --> 00:56:02.945
Honey, there's nothing
you can do for me.

711
00:56:09.243 --> 00:56:10.619
Can I ask you something?

712
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:13.831
Yeah.

713
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:18.710
Why did you change your mind?

714
00:56:21.255 --> 00:56:23.382
About what?

715
00:56:23.423 --> 00:56:26.218
About going hiking
with me and Marcos.

716
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.428
I already told you.

717
00:56:32.057 --> 00:56:33.497
You sure there wasn't
something else?

718
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:39.189
No. That was it.

719
00:56:41.066 --> 00:56:42.276
You blame me.

720
00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:46.113
For what?

721
00:56:46.155 --> 00:56:48.031
If I hadn't changed my mind,

722
00:56:48.073 --> 00:56:49.950
you'd be preparing
for your lecture.

723
00:56:49.992 --> 00:56:52.411
No. No, no, no. I
didn't say that.

724
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:54.246
But it's true.

725
00:56:54.288 --> 00:56:56.057
Honey, don't put words in
my mouth. That's not what...

726
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:58.083
Then why did you
bring it up now?

727
00:57:03.088 --> 00:57:04.673
I don't know.

728
00:57:04.715 --> 00:57:06.675
Because it's my fault?

729
00:57:10.679 --> 00:57:12.890
I'm so sorry.

730
00:57:12.931 --> 00:57:16.226
Me, too.

731
00:57:16.268 --> 00:57:18.645
Ah, fuck. Oh!

732
00:57:18.687 --> 00:57:20.856
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

733
00:57:20.898 --> 00:57:24.151
- Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
- Let me see. Let me see.

734
00:57:28.113 --> 00:57:31.408
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts everywhere.

735
00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:32.802
Do you feel when
I press down here?

736
00:57:32.826 --> 00:57:34.328
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

737
00:57:35.662 --> 00:57:38.916
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

738
00:57:38.957 --> 00:57:42.211
It's pretty hot.

739
00:57:42.252 --> 00:57:44.087
- I think it's thrombophlebitis.
- What?

740
00:57:44.129 --> 00:57:47.466
It's coagulating your
blood, turning it to Jell-O.

741
00:57:47.507 --> 00:57:48.902
At least dying by a
stroke is better than

742
00:57:48.926 --> 00:57:50.344
starving to death, right?

743
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:54.139
Don't say that.

744
00:57:57.726 --> 00:57:59.645
What are you doing?

745
00:57:59.686 --> 00:58:03.106
What are you doing?
No, no. Sofia.

746
00:58:03.148 --> 00:58:04.816
There's a clot.

747
00:58:04.858 --> 00:58:07.486
It's blocking your blood
flow to your brain.

748
00:58:07.527 --> 00:58:10.364
You're gonna have a stroke.
I have to do this, all right?

749
00:58:10.405 --> 00:58:13.116
Put down the knife.

750
00:58:13.158 --> 00:58:14.552
You haven't done anything
like this in years.

751
00:58:14.576 --> 00:58:18.121
I'm still a doctor.

752
00:58:18.163 --> 00:58:19.957
I'm gonna cut your
clot, all right?

753
00:58:23.585 --> 00:58:26.505
Honey. Baby, come on.

754
00:58:26.546 --> 00:58:27.965
Fuck.

755
00:58:29.049 --> 00:58:31.927
Just let me. All right?

756
00:58:31.969 --> 00:58:34.346
Why won't you let me?

757
00:58:34.388 --> 00:58:36.431
Because there's only
one bullet left.

758
00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:41.520
You have to trust me
when I'm telling you

759
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:42.896
we're gonna get out of this.

760
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.608
No one's coming for us.

761
00:58:49.319 --> 00:58:52.364
- Let me. Oh, shit.
- Honey.

762
00:58:52.406 --> 00:58:56.159
No. Oh, my God. It's
getting worse. Jesus.

763
00:58:56.201 --> 00:58:58.578
- I have to do it now.
- I don't want you to.

764
00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:03.750
I've taken two oaths in my life.

765
00:59:03.792 --> 00:59:06.169
One as a doctor.

766
00:59:06.211 --> 00:59:08.547
One as a wife.

767
00:59:08.588 --> 00:59:10.090
You don't get to decide.

768
00:59:12.801 --> 00:59:16.179
Baby.
Baby, look at me.

769
00:59:16.221 --> 00:59:17.681
It's gonna hurt.

770
00:59:20.434 --> 00:59:23.729
Yep.

771
00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.982
- Where you gonna cut?
- Carotid artery.

772
00:59:27.024 --> 00:59:28.900
Make sure you seal it
up when you're done?

773
00:59:28.942 --> 00:59:32.529
I won't let you bleed
out, believe me.

774
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:35.240
I love you. I...

775
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.042
We're almost there.
You're doing great, babe.

776
00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:47.419
Almost done.

777
00:59:47.461 --> 00:59:48.587
We're almost there, babe.

778
00:59:48.628 --> 00:59:51.548
Here.

779
01:00:00.724 --> 01:00:01.725
Fuck.

780
01:00:05.479 --> 01:00:08.482
Oh, my God.

781
01:01:02.911 --> 01:01:05.330
Hi.

782
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.710
How are you feeling?

783
01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:14.089
My body is a little numb.

784
01:01:14.131 --> 01:01:16.508
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

785
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:17.968
Okay.

786
01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:20.262
It's in shock.

787
01:01:20.303 --> 01:01:22.973
How long was I out?

788
01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.853
An hour, I guess.

789
01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.233
- You did it.
- We made it.

790
01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:35.735
You did it.

791
01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:39.823
Thank you.

792
01:01:43.952 --> 01:01:46.746
Do you remember what you
said before you passed out?

793
01:01:46.788 --> 01:01:48.748
Yeah.

794
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:53.170
Did you mean it?

795
01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:57.591
Did I mean it?

796
01:01:59.176 --> 01:02:01.386
Yeah, I did.

797
01:02:10.979 --> 01:02:15.609
Do you think our kids already
know that we're missing?

798
01:02:19.988 --> 01:02:22.115
God, I hope not.

799
01:02:22.157 --> 01:02:23.783
Yeah, maybe not.

800
01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:34.377
There's one thing that
keeps going through my mind

801
01:02:34.419 --> 01:02:38.381
over and over in this
sick and stupid way.

802
01:02:38.423 --> 01:02:41.510
What's that?

803
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:43.428
That I'm not gonna get
to give that lecture.

804
01:02:46.014 --> 01:02:50.060
Isn't it crazy that I'm
so consumed with that?

805
01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:52.437
That is not crazy.

806
01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.237
No, it's not crazy.

807
01:03:03.657 --> 01:03:05.659
Maybe I just needed it.

808
01:03:08.036 --> 01:03:09.663
It was so important.

809
01:03:12.457 --> 01:03:15.794
Something to bring my confidence
back before I started work.

810
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:18.797
You don't need a
lecture to do that.

811
01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:22.467
I do, though. More
than you think.

812
01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:30.350
- Josh, I was so good.
- Uh-huh.

813
01:03:30.392 --> 01:03:34.229
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I was really good.

814
01:03:34.271 --> 01:03:37.482
Top of our class. The
first to be published.

815
01:03:39.484 --> 01:03:42.946
I got staffed at the number
one hospital in the city.

816
01:03:42.988 --> 01:03:45.073
You're a great doctor.

817
01:03:48.034 --> 01:03:49.494
But then I stopped.

818
01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.458
I know I was making
the right decision.

819
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.044
I still believe that.

820
01:03:58.086 --> 01:03:59.879
I wanted to be
around for the kids.

821
01:04:02.299 --> 01:04:06.511
But there's this thing
I just... I just lost.

822
01:04:11.308 --> 01:04:14.060
I became a mother.

823
01:04:14.102 --> 01:04:15.520
Your wife.

824
01:04:17.522 --> 01:04:22.485
But somehow me?

825
01:04:22.527 --> 01:04:26.698
Me. Sofia.

826
01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.992
It's so hard to find sometimes.

827
01:04:31.745 --> 01:04:33.330
I don't know where I am.

828
01:04:36.124 --> 01:04:38.710
I still see the real you.

829
01:04:38.752 --> 01:04:41.421
You don't, though.

830
01:04:41.463 --> 01:04:43.506
Should've said this
to you more often.

831
01:04:43.548 --> 01:04:46.885
- I should've... no.
- Please stop.

832
01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:50.305
The sacrifice you
made to stop working?

833
01:04:50.347 --> 01:04:52.557
Stay home with our kids?

834
01:04:56.561 --> 01:04:58.647
They are so much better
off because of it.

835
01:05:00.774 --> 01:05:04.736
Sof, you're such a good mother.

836
01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:06.655
They are so lucky to have you.

837
01:05:06.696 --> 01:05:09.366
I was so lucky to have you.

838
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.331
I can't stop
thinking about them.

839
01:05:16.373 --> 01:05:20.168
- I know.
- Our home waiting for us.

840
01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:24.172
I don't want them to be alone.

841
01:05:25.799 --> 01:05:27.133
I don't wanna leave them.

842
01:05:27.175 --> 01:05:29.761
They're going to
be okay, you know?

843
01:05:29.803 --> 01:05:33.598
They're... They're
going to be okay.

844
01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:38.812
I love you.

845
01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:41.606
I love you, too.

846
01:06:22.439 --> 01:06:26.192
So I need eight more
feet to lasso that rock.

847
01:06:26.234 --> 01:06:28.820
Hmm. Maybe, yeah.

848
01:06:28.862 --> 01:06:29.863
The snake.

849
01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:33.450
It's longer than eight feet.

850
01:06:35.243 --> 01:06:36.619
Okay, what do you mean?

851
01:06:36.661 --> 01:06:39.330
It's thick. It won't break.

852
01:06:39.372 --> 01:06:42.625
- Uh-huh.
- We can use it as a rope.

853
01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:45.837
I don't think the snake's
gonna let you tie it

854
01:06:45.879 --> 01:06:48.339
to a rope backpack
around its head.

855
01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:51.468
I'm gonna kill it.

856
01:06:54.888 --> 01:06:57.348
I need to get you out of this.

857
01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.435
- Honey?
- Mm.

858
01:07:00.477 --> 01:07:04.355
That snake might be miles
away from here by now.

859
01:07:04.397 --> 01:07:06.649
No, it is near.

860
01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:10.445
It's a mother
protecting her eggs.

861
01:07:10.487 --> 01:07:12.071
She must be around here.

862
01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:15.784
Her nest. Its nest.

863
01:07:15.825 --> 01:07:19.370
It must be around here.

864
01:07:19.412 --> 01:07:22.290
- We just need to find it.
- Okay.

865
01:08:03.873 --> 01:08:07.377
Yes. It's right there.

866
01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:09.420
Honey.

867
01:08:09.462 --> 01:08:10.922
I can't turn my head.

868
01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:12.841
Don't try to.

869
01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:15.552
I'm not gonna be
able to help you.

870
01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:21.307
Don't try.

871
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:24.519
Just stay calm. Stay with me.

872
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:27.313
- You'll be fine. I'll do it.
- Yeah.

873
01:08:27.355 --> 01:08:30.316
All right? I can do it.

874
01:08:30.358 --> 01:08:31.776
Just stay with me.

875
01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.780
Stay with me.

876
01:08:35.822 --> 01:08:36.990
Stay with me.

877
01:11:32.957 --> 01:11:34.333
Get us out of here.

878
01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:56.249
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

879
01:12:57.834 --> 01:12:59.627
Did you get it?

880
01:13:03.548 --> 01:13:05.007
Just stay with me, all right?

881
01:13:26.279 --> 01:13:29.115
Yeah.

882
01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:24.045
Baby.

883
01:14:25.922 --> 01:14:27.924
Josh. Josh!

884
01:14:28.925 --> 01:14:30.551
Josh. Josh.

885
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:36.933
Hey. Grab my hand.

886
01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:41.103
You made it.

887
01:14:41.145 --> 01:14:42.605
Baby!

888
01:14:42.647 --> 01:14:43.898
Grab my hand!

889
01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.149
I can't.

890
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.777
Yes, you can.

891
01:14:47.818 --> 01:14:50.529
I can't move.

892
01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:53.032
Baby.

893
01:14:53.074 --> 01:14:56.911
- You gotta go get help.
- No, no, no.

894
01:14:56.953 --> 01:14:59.121
- We have no time. Baby.
- Go get help.

895
01:14:59.163 --> 01:15:00.515
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Go get help.

896
01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:02.625
No, no. No. No.

897
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:04.502
I'm not gonna leave you.

898
01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:06.170
Go.

899
01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:28.182
Marcos: Sofia! Sofia!

900
01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:45.449
Josh!

901
01:19:47.243 --> 01:19:48.244
Josh!

902
01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:51.830
Josh!
