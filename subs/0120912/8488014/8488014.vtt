-(Announcer )
Mysteries in History,

2
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.000
with your host Peter Graves.

3
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.030
Although no one
has ever been able to
prove their existence,

4
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.540
a quasi-government agency
known as the Men In Black...

5
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.910
supposedly carries out
secret operations
here on Earth...

6
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.150
in order to
keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.

7
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.820
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

8
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.820
from one of their files...

9
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.190
that doesn't exist.

10
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.290
.

11
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.890
Leaders of Zartha
flee their planet...

12
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.790
in order to escape the
clutches

13
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.700
of the evil Kylothian
Serleena.

14
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.830
Arriving on Earth,
the Zarthans bring with them
their greatest treasure,

15
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.840
the Light of Zartha,

16
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140
a cosmic force so powerful...

17
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.940
that, in the wrong hands,
it could lead to
the annihilation of Zartha.

18
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.210
The Zarthan's princess,
Lauranna,

19
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.380
beseeched the Men In Black to
hide the Light from Serleena.

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.850
But they had no choice.

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.130
However, in an act
of galactic bravery,

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.930
the Men In Black
subdued Serleena,

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
allowing the Zarthans
to escape,

25
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.330
so they might hide the Light
on another planet.

26
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.870
Serleena,
released from her captors,

27
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.180
vowed that the Light
would be hers,

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.610
and that she would destroy
any planet,

29
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.650
that stood in her way.

30
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.350
And so,
never knowing what happened,

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420
the people of Earth
were once again saved

32
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.590
by a secret society
of protectors

33
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.090
known as the Men In Black.

34
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.230
[ Man ]
Harvey!
[ Dog Continues Barking ]

35
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.730
Harvey,
get over here!

36
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.730
Harvey!
Heel! Heel!

37
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.240
You're barking
at the moon, moron.

38
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.240
Harvey. Harvey!

39
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.140
Harvey!

40
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.920
(Barking Continues)

41
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.720

42

(Roars)

43
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.550
(Squeaking, Shrieking)

44
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.190
Hey, pretty lady.

45
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.630
You taste good.

46
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.970
(Man)
Hey, what the...

47
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.300
(Creature Roaring)
(Man Screaming)

48
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.510
-(Woman)
Yeah, you too.

49
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.480
(Sloshing, Gurgling)

50
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.720
(Growls Softly)

-(Vomiting)
-(Body Splatters
On Ground)

52
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.760
-Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book this time.
-Got it.

53
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.430
- Hey.
- Ooh!

54
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.570
Uh, hey, Jeff.
What's happening, buddy?

55
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.900
We were just wondering
what you were doing here.

56
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.640
The man's talkin' to ya.

57
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.270
You know
our arrangements, Jeff.

58
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.040
You don't travel outside
of the "E," "F" and "R"
subway lines. In exchange

59
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.940
you get to eat all the
inorganic garbage you want.

60
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.750
- What the hell are you
doing here, worm boy?
- Uh, Tee.

61
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.480
Jeff, uh,
excuse my partner.

62
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.890
H-He's new, and he--

63
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.560
(Screaming)

64
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.560
- Kinda stupid.
- Whoa!

65
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.230
(Growls)
Whoo.

66
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.770
You gettin' big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eatin'?

67
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.170
(Yelling)

68
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.470
Oh, you like jokes, huh?

69
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.850
Jeffrey.

70
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.310
(Yelling)

71
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.480
Hey!

72
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.790
(Grunts)

73
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.720
All right.

74
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.690
(Exhale)
Sweet dreams, big boy.

75
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.840
Aah! Aaah!

76
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.320
Whoo!
(Jeff Shrieking)

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.520
(Laughing)

78
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.190
Ha-ha!

79
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.560
Sweet--

81
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.200
Big boy?

82
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.600
Transit Authority, people.
.

83
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.200
Please move to the
forward car.

84
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.470
We got a bug
in the electrical system.

85
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.710
Yo! People!

86
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.650
We got a bug
in the electrical system!

87
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.710
(ALL SCREAMING)

88
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.050
Oh, now you all runnin'.
No, no, no, sit down.
It's only a 600-foot worm.

89
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.230
Everybody out
before I start
knockin' heads here.

90
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.160
Put the hammer down
on this thing.

91
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.270
I'm Capt. Larry Bridgewater,
and I decide what happens
on this train.

92
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.300
Oh, you decide?
Oh. Okay, come here.

93
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.540
Larry?
That's my man Jeff.

94
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.010
Larry just made
a decision.

95
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.980
-Yeah, Larry needs to
take his ass in there.
-Yeah.

96
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.380
(ROARING)

97
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.620
Don't make me do this,
Jeff.

81st Street.

100
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.360
Just a second.

101
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.360
May I have
your attention, please?

102
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.800
The City of New York
would like to thank you for
participating in our drill.

103
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.800
Had this been
an actual emergency,
y'all would've been eaten.

104
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.500
'Cause you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

105
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.800
How a man gon'
come bashin' through
a subway win--

106
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.040
That's the problem with
all 'y'all New Yorkers--
"Oh, we've seen it all."

107
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.380
"Oh, no, a 600-foot worm.
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

108
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.750
I ask you nice,
move to the next car.
Y'all just sit there like--

109
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.880
Thank you for participating
in our drill.

110
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.160
Hopefully you enjoyed
our new smaller, more
energy efficient subway cars.

111
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.390
Watch your step.
You all have a nice evening.

112
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.030
I need the perimeter secured
and a cleanup crew
at 81st and Central Park West.

113
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.640
Revoke Jeff's
movement privileges
immediately.

114
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.540
Have a transfer team
escort him back to
the Chamber Street station.

115
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.710
And will somebody please
check the expiration date on
the Unipod worm tranquilizers?

116
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.920
Sorry, fellas.
Station closed.

117
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.650
Emergency drill.
For your safety.

118
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.750
Can you believe
these people?

119
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.820
You're welcome.

122
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.310
(SIGHS)
I know. By the book.

123
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.740
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

124
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.610
This is a test.
I can do this.

125
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.520
You ever feel like
you're alone in the universe?

126
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.490
Yes.

127
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.320
No.

128
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.330
-Let me buy you
a piece of pie.
-Really?

129
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.360
Thanks.

130
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.300
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

131
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.700
-Remove the arm.
-Okay.

132
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.880
Please shut up,
Charlie.

133
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.810
I'm tired of you constantly
talking behind my back.

134
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.050
You meet a beautiful girl,
she's into it, and the best
line you can come up with is,

135
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.120
"Wanna come back to my place
for some tonsil hockey
and egg salad?"

136
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.090
Whoa! W-Who are you,
and how'd you get in here?

137
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.930
You like egg salad?

138
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.000
Serleena!
(WIMPERING)

139
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.040
Why didn't you say...
it was you?

140
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.600
(BOTH EXHALE)
I got your message.

141
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.470
Where's the Light?
Here's the deal.

142
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.640
You been all over the universe
looking for this Light thing,
and we found it.

143
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.610
You want it?
It's gonna cost you 50 mil.
Here's how it's gonna work.

144
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.010
- First, you--
- Where is... the Light?

145
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.220
(SCREAMING)

146
00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.390
We couldn't find the Light,
but we tracked it to a guy
who might know where it is.

147
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.290
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

148
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.960
Let's go.

149
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.430
And wipe your nose,
idiot.

150
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.670
Hmm.
Oh. Good pie.

151
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.780
Yeah.

152
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.340
Crowded.

153
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.210
Well, they got
good pie.

154
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.120
(SNIFFILING AND SOBBING)

155
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.290
-Man,
what is wrong with you?
-You're gonna neuralyze me.

156
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.160
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

157
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.530
-You took me to a public
place so I wouldn't
make a scene.

158
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.790
You makin' a scene.

159
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.900
Look, let me
ask you a question:

160
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.870
- Why did you join M.I.B.?
- Six years in the Marines.

161
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.300
I like to serve.
I like the action.
Protect the planet.

162
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.670
You like being a hero?
Then you joined
the wrong organization.

163
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.810
You ever heard
of James Edwards?

164
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.280
-No.

165
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.580
Well, he saved the lives
of about 85 people
on the subway tonight.

166
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.880
No one knows he exists.

167
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.150
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

168
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.960
(CONTINUES SOBBING
LOUDLY)

169
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.190
Hey, how long
we been partners?

170
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.860
-Feb 1.
-Five months,

When-dah.

1133
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:11.760
Jay? Frank.
You were the best darn partner
a Remoolian could ever have.

1134
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:13.560
Godspeed.

1135
01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:17.430
Frank. Frank? Frank!

1136
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.070
Okay, here we go.
Automatic pilot.
[ Beeps ]

1137
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:24.110
It is not
automatic piloting.

1138
01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:26.780
He doesn't operate
at hyper-speed.
I could use a steering wheel!

1139
01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.710
We don't have
no damn steering wheel.
This what we got.

1140
01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:33.520
Didn't your mother
ever give you a Game Boy?

1141
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.720
- What is a Game Boy?
- You know what? Move. Move!

1142
01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.190
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, that is not
the navigational stalk.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

1144
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.870
Okay, straight down.

1145
01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.810
Idiots.

1146
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:13.290
- The subway may not be
the best place to lose her.
- Shh!

1147
01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:18.130
-Where is he?
-He?
-Jeff.

1148
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:19.260
Hang on!

Runnin' out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

1152
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.810
Right here.

1153
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:07.280
- What?
- What, I'm the Light?

1154
01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.750
-No. No way.
-You have a planet
to save, Laura.

1155
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:14.180
You've got me confused
with somebody else. I work
part-time at a pizzeria.

1156
01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.350
Two days ago, I was running
a post office in Truro, Mass.
You are who you are.

1157
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.360
Laura,
you are the Light.

1158
01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.960
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

1159
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:26.700
The power is within you
to save the planet.

1160
01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.330
I protected you until
it was your time.
Your time is now.

1161
01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.240
You were hidden on Earth
25 years ago to...

1162
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.940
You are going to
save a world.

-I can't be...
-You know things before
they happen.

I'm a Libra.

You're Zarthan.
When you get sad,
it always seems to rain.

1166
01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.020
Well, lots of people
get sad when it rains.

1167
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.950
It rains because
you're sad, baby.

1168
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.840
It's not fair.

1169
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.610
Never is.

1170
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:57.950
We are who we are.

Jeff, I am so not in the mood
for you! Get back
in the subway, right now!

1173
01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.280

-It's nice.

No, Kay, it's actually
kind of sad, man, really.
