00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:28.738
Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves.

2
00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.951
Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence...

3
00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:37.288
...a quasi-government agency,
known as the Men in Black...

4
00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:40.791
...supposedly carries out secret
operations here on Earth...

5
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.046
...In order to keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.

6
00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:48.716
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened”...

7
00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:53.095
...from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

8
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.807
1978. The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet...

9
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:03.272
...in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.

10
00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:07.652
Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring
with them their greatest treasure:

11
00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:10.863
The Light of Zartha,
a cosmic force so powerful...

12
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.786
...that in the wrong hands,
it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha.

13
00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:20.623
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna,
beseeched the Men in Black...

14
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.209
...to hide the Light from Serleena.

15
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.711
But they had no choice.

16
00:01:25.878 --> 00:01:29.298
Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.

17
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:35.930
However, in an act of galactic bravery,
the Men in Black subdued Serleena...

18
00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:38.224
...allowing the Zarthans to escape...

19
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:41.102
...So they might hide the Light
on another planet.

20
00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:47.817
Serleena, released from her captors,
vowed that the Light would be hers...

21
00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:52.947
...and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way.

22
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.742
And so
never knowing what happened...

23
00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.331
...the people of Earth were, once again,
saved by a secret society of protectors...

24
00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:05.543
...known as the Men in Black.

25
00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.519
Harvey!

26
00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:50.189
Harvey, get over here!

27
00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:52.858
Harvey. Heel, heel!

28
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.236
You're barking at the moon, moron.

29
00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:57.238
Harvey. Harvey!

30
00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:58.781
Harvey!

31
00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:00.319
Hey, pretty lady.

32
00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:02.947
You taste good.

33
00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.786
Hey, what the--?

34
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:16.085
Yeah, you too.

35
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.303
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book this time.

36
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.013
Got it. Hey!

37
00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:12.433
Hey, Jeff. What's happening, buddy?

38
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.810
We were just wondering
what you're doing here.

39
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.687
The man's talking to you.

40
00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:18.272
You know our arrangements.

41
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.150
You don't travel outside of the E,
F and R subway lines...

42
00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.694
...and you get all the garbage
you want.

43
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:26.614
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

44
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.823
Tee.

45
00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:29.742
Jeff....

46
00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.077
Excuse my partner.
He's new, and he's...

47
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.751
...kind of stupid.

48
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.927
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

49
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.892
You like jokes, huh?

50
00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.063
Jeffrey!

51
00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.696
All right.

52
00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.658
Sweet dreams, big boy.

53
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.236
Sweet dreams...

54
00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.492
...big boy.

55
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:56.453
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

56
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.164
We got a bug in the electrical system.

57
00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:02.251
Yo, people!

58
00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:06.255
We got a bug in the electrical system!

59
00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:11.844
Oh, now y'all running?

60
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.721
No, no, no! Sit down! Sit down!

61
00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.681
It's only a 600-foot worm.

62
00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:23.188
-Everybody out before I knock heads.
-Put the hammer down on this thing.

63
00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:26.817
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens on this train.

64
00:09:26.984 --> 00:09:29.695
You decide?
Okay, come here. Come here.

65
00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:31.864
-Larry? That's my man, Jeff.
-Yeah.

66
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.371
-Larry just made a decision.
-Larry need to take his ass in there.

67
00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.589
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

68
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.034
Eighty-first Street.

69
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.206
Just a second.

70
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.418
May I have your attention, please?

71
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.922
The City of New York would like
to thank you for participating in our drill.

72
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.091
Had this been an actual emergency,
y'all would've been eaten.

73
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.761
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

74
00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:38.013
How a man gonna bash
through a subway--?

75
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.098
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

76
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.894
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

77
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:47.523
I ask you nice, "Move to the next car."
You just sit there like--

78
00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:51.860
Thank you for participating.

79
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:55.948
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
more energy-efficient subway cars.

80
00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:59.576
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

81
00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:05.123
I need the perimeter secured
and a cleanup crew...

82
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.125
...at 81st and Central Park West.

83
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:09.503
Revoke Jeff's movement
privileges immediately.

84
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.381
Have him escorted
to the Chambers Street station.

85
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:17.469
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

86
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.684
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

87
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:28.230
-Emergency drill. For your safety.
-Do you believe these putzes?

88
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.316
You're welcome.

89
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.249
I know. By the book.

90
00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:51.879
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

91
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:55.132
This is a test. I can do this.

92
00:11:57.426 --> 00:12:00.012
You ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

93
00:12:00.178 --> 00:12:01.722
Yes.

94
00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:05.350
No.

95
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.647
-Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
-Really?

96
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.649
Thanks.

97
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.153
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

98
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.530
-Remove the arm.
-Okay.

99
00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.744
Please, shut up, Charlie.

100
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:27.331
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

101
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.045
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

102
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:37.341
"Wanna come back to my place for
some tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

103
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:41.136
-Who are you and how'd you get in?
-You like egg salad?

104
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.891
Serleena!

105
00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:49.269
Why didn't you say it was you?

106
00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:52.689
-I got your message. Where's the Light?
-Here's the deal.

107
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.192
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

108
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:59.655
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First--

109
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.741
Where is the Light?

110
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:12.042
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

111
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.253
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

112
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.631
Let's go.

113
00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.425
And wipe your nose, idiot.

114
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.685
-Good pie.
-Yeah.

115
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:32.521
Crowded.

116
00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:34.523
Well, they got good pie.

117
00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:41.363
What is wrong with you?

118
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.657
-You're gonna neuralyze me.
-No, I'm not.

119
00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:46.451
You took me to a public place
so I wouldn't make a scene.

120
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.412
You making a scene.

121
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.416
Look, let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

122
00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:56.128
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.

123
00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:59.589
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

124
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:03.719
-You ever heard of James Edwards?
-No.

125
00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.806
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

126
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:10.475
No one knows he exists.

127
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:15.564
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

128
00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.570
Hey, how long we been partners?

129
00:14:21.737 --> 00:14:24.698
-Feb 1.
-Five months, three days.

130
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.576
-Started at noon.
-Nine hours.

131
00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:37.085
Get married. Have a bunch of kids.

132
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:39.296
Okay.

133
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:47.512
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

134
00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.519
Here it is. Ta-da.

135
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:56.938
Ben, I don't know what to say.

136
00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.025
Years from now,
you know what people will say?

137
00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:02.819
-"Employee" is spelled wrong?
-They charge by the letter.

138
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:07.824
People will say, "Imagine that.
Big shot like her used to work here."

139
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.367
-Ben--
-You deserve it.

140
00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.704
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

141
00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:17.292
Hey, Bruno.

142
00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:19.628
Two slices of pepperoni...

143
00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:22.839
...and any information you might have
about the Light of Zartha.

144
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:26.343
-Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
-Where's the Light, Ben?

145
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.971
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me down, ma'am.

146
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.640
I wanna report a robbery--

147
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.316
There.

148
00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.151
Noise.

149
00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:46.154
Kitchen!

150
00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:52.160
You idiots see anything?

151
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.955
Wind blew the door open.

152
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.041
Nothing out of the ordinary.

153
00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.503
For 25 years, I've traveled
the universe looking for it.

154
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.798
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

155
00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:06.550
What are you talking about?

156
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.261
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

157
00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:12.222
-I don't know what you mean.
-Listen, Zarthan.

158
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.975
You hid the Light on Earth,
and I will find it.

159
00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:18.687
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

160
00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:21.398
You're too late.
Tomorrow, at midnight...

161
00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:25.110
...the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

162
00:16:25.277 --> 00:16:28.321
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

163
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.417
Got nothing. Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

164
00:16:40.584 --> 00:16:42.961
He said "third planet."
It's here, you idiot.

165
00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:46.631
- Third Rock from the Sun.
-I never got that till now.

166
00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:51.219
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

167
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.663
-Don't you ever go home?
-Nope.

168
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.666
I see you neuralyzed another partner.

169
00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:30.926
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carbonizer...

170
00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.679
...attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

171
00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:38.266
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

172
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.105
Check his visa.

173
00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:48.443
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

174
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.865
Why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

175
00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:58.203
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

176
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.915
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing, sir.

177
00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.003
Good work in the subway.

178
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.005
I remember Jeff
when he was yea high.

179
00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.049
What you got for me?

180
00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.510
Look. See those guys in black suits?

181
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:16.763
-They work here. We got it covered.
-Zed, what you got?

182
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.101
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

183
00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.312
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

184
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.648
...ish?

185
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:29.734
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

186
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.905
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

187
00:18:34.072 --> 00:18:35.156
Alien-on-alien.

188
00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.909
Take Tee with you and make a report.

189
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.912
Tee. Right.

190
00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.498
What happened,
what happened with Tee--

191
00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:46.668
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?

192
00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.838
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

193
00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:52.257
The dude was crying
in the middle of the diner.

194
00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:53.967
I hate that.

195
00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.761
And plus, you can't count Elle.

196
00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.889
She wanted to go back to the morgue.
I helped her.

197
00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.934
-You need a partner.
-I'm cool.

198
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.228
I'll be his partner.

199
00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:09.107
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.

200
00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.484
-Thought I'd never get out.
-Lose the suit.

201
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.862
Sure thing, partner.
Just going for the look.

202
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.865
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.

203
00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:19.534
Not that I've had any problems
with the ladies.

204
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.286
When you get down to brass tacks--

205
00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.204
Nice sled, very swank.

206
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.498
Heated seats? Sometimes, I get hives.

207
00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.271
Frank!

208
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.776
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

209
00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.319
Got it.

210
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.785
Frank!

211
00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.996
My money? It's missionary.

212
00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:08.249
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

213
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.668
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

214
00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.046
That's just not appealing to me, man.
Seriously.

215
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:16.424
Okay. Okay. So I say we do the good-cop,
bad-cop thing.

216
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.135
You interrogate the witness,
and I growl.

217
00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:23.598
How about we do the good-cop,
dumb-dog thing, and you just shut up?

218
00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.101
You got it, partner. Total silence.

219
00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.395
Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me.

220
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:31.940
What do we got?

221
00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:33.817
Zip.

222
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.529
-What do we got?
-There's phosphorus residue on the wall.

223
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:42.617
-We sent samples to Em for analysis.
-Hey, Jay, 0-percent body fat.

224
00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.038
-Funny.
-Witness?

225
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.541
Girl. Saw everything.

226
00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.293
She's taking it well.

227
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.631
I won't answer any more questions.
I wanna know what happened here.

228
00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:59.092
-I'll handle this one.
-You got it.

229
00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:02.637
Alone. The talking-dog thing
might be a bit much for her right now.

230
00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.848
What do you want me to do?

231
00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.225
Sniff around.

232
00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.352
What?

233
00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:10.979
Funny.

234
00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.606
Take a deep breath, ma'am.
Everything is all right.

235
00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.901
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

236
00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:21.698
I'm Agent Jay.

237
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:23.366
Tell me what you saw.

238
00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:26.035
-A two-headed guy and a woman.
-Caucasian?

239
00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.164
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip--

240
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.498
His skin off of his body.

241
00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:35.920
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

242
00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:38.673
-What was the last thing you ate?
-Calzone.

243
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.966
-What time?
-Lunch.

244
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.426
-Spinach?
-Mushroom.

245
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:44.929
You need pie.

246
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.099
A light.
They just kept asking Ben about a light.

247
00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.477
"Light of Zartha,"
or something like that.

248
00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.520
You okay?

249
00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:55.982
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished...

250
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.735
...because of a woman with things
coming out her fingers...

251
00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:01.613
...and a two-headed guy
with the 1Q of a cannoli.

252
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.907
So yeah, everything's okay.

253
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:09.746
Look, when we're kids,
before we're taught how to think...

254
00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:13.041
...our hearts tell us
there is something else out there.

255
00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.335
Now, I know what I saw.

256
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:18.338
You tell me what
I'm supposed to believe.

257
00:22:23.885 --> 00:22:25.720
I'm a member of
a secret organization...

258
00:22:25.887 --> 00:22:29.098
...that polices and monitors
alien activity on Earth.

259
00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:31.476
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

260
00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:35.647
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

261
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.900
Okay.

262
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.819
-Okay?
-Okay.

263
00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:44.656
Okay.

264
00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:52.747
-I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to--
-Kill me.

265
00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:54.249
No!

266
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:58.545
No. Just a little flash,
and everything goes back the way it was.

267
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:02.090
After you flash me...

268
00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:04.926
...if I see you again,
will I know it's you?

269
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:07.095
I'll see you.

270
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:11.516
But you won't see me.

271
00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:12.725
Must be hard.

272
00:23:13.935 --> 00:23:15.812
Must be very lonely.

273
00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:32.620
Excuse me.

274
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:36.958
-I gotta go.
-What about the flashy thing?

275
00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.712
I'll flash you some other time.

276
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.148
What?

277
00:24:04.694 --> 00:24:10.199
-Did you tell the girl you love her?
-She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

278
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:14.495
You're attracted. She's not
even my species, and I'm attracted.

279
00:24:14.662 --> 00:24:18.666
I should take advice on love
from a dude that chases his own ass?

280
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.837
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

281
00:24:39.562 --> 00:24:40.897
Hey, Jay, wait up.

282
00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:44.067
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

283
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:48.196
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing?

284
00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:50.657
Frank, just cool out, dog.

285
00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:53.951
-Got kids?
-No.

286
00:24:54.118 --> 00:24:55.578
Want them?

287
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.792
Get him off me!

288
00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.761
-Talk to me.
-It's Kylothian, class C.

289
00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:12.970
Serleena.

290
00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:15.556
-Serleena. Old girlfriend?
-She wishes.

291
00:25:15.723 --> 00:25:18.351
Witness said the perps were looking
for the Light of--

292
00:25:18.518 --> 00:25:20.186
-Zartha.
-Yeah, what is it?

293
00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:22.814
This makes no sense.
The Light's not on Earth.

294
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.275
-We took care of this a long time ago.
-Well, obviously not.

295
00:25:26.442 --> 00:25:28.361
That is very bad news.

296
00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:32.365
Twenty-five years ago, The Zarthans came
to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena.

297
00:25:32.532 --> 00:25:35.993
-We don't do that.
-Right. I ordered it off the planet.

298
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.787
Well, Zed...

299
00:25:37.954 --> 00:25:42.417
...I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

300
00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:46.170
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

301
00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.923
-It's as if I gave the order to you.
-Ask the agent.

302
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.174
-Can't.
-Dead?

303
00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:53.511
Sort of. He works at the post office.

304
00:25:54.679 --> 00:25:55.805
No.

305
00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:58.641
If Serleena gets to Kay before we do,
he's dead.

306
00:25:58.808 --> 00:26:01.853
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

307
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.480
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

308
00:26:04.647 --> 00:26:06.149
Bring him in.

309
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:07.525
Now.

310
00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:11.779
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

311
00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.490
Your mentor, the guy who taught you
everything you know.

312
00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:19.287
-The greatest agent in MiB history!
-Frank! Stop talking.

313
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:24.375
Stay.

314
00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:27.170
Listen, partner.
I may look like a dog...

315
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:29.797
...but I only play one here on Earth.

316
00:26:30.173 --> 00:26:33.217
-Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
-Hey, babe.

317
00:26:39.015 --> 00:26:42.310
Good people of Truro, Massachusetts
may I kindly have your attention?

318
00:26:42.477 --> 00:26:44.896
To facilitate your shipping needs...

319
00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.732
...all packages must be
properly wrapped.

320
00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:51.778
This one is an example of
"go home, and do it again."

321
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:54.655
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin.

322
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:59.786
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

323
00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:01.829
Thank you for your time.

324
00:27:02.914 --> 00:27:05.792
-Kay.
-C. Express mail, two-day air.

325
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:08.836
Kevin.

326
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:13.758
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"...

327
00:27:16.511 --> 00:27:18.721
You don't remember me,
but we worked together.

328
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:22.266
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

329
00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:24.852
Okay. Straight to the point.

330
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:29.774
You are a former agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

331
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:34.028
We're the Men in Black.
We have a situation. We need your help.

332
00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:37.907
There is a free mental-health clinic
at the corner of Lilac and East Valley.

333
00:27:38.074 --> 00:27:40.076
-Next.
-Excuse me.

334
00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.620
-Twenty Rugrats stamps.
-Elizabeth.

335
00:27:42.787 --> 00:27:47.083
The United States Postal Service hasn't
kept up with today's youth, but we have...

336
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.919
-...Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?
-No. No.

337
00:27:50.086 --> 00:27:53.089
-American Samoa? Amish quilts.
-No.

338
00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:55.967
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

339
00:27:57.301 --> 00:27:59.303
There was no coma. It was all a cover.

340
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.347
-Who are you?
-Question is: Who are you?

341
00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:04.851
The Postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts,
and I'm ordering you to leave.

342
00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:06.519
Kay....

343
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:10.147
-Is that decaf?
-Sorry.

344
00:28:10.314 --> 00:28:12.817
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

345
00:28:12.984 --> 00:28:15.695
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

346
00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:19.323
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

347
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.575
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:23.786
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

349
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.261
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

350
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.683
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

351
00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:36.859
No smoking.

352
00:29:46.702 --> 00:29:47.828
Kay.

353
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.749
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

354
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.417
You're nothing special.

355
00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:56.504
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling...

356
00:29:56.671 --> 00:29:58.673
...like you don't know who you are.

357
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:02.426
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

358
00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:04.595
That's why she left you, Kay.

359
00:30:04.762 --> 00:30:07.181
That's why your wife left you.

360
00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:10.935
Okay, I'll tell you what.

361
00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:15.147
You decide you wanna know who
you really are, come take a ride with me.

362
00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:18.025
If not, people are waiting
for their TV Guides.

363
00:30:22.363 --> 00:30:23.864
Think he'll bite?

364
00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:33.499
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's hasta luego.

365
00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:35.251
Hey, Kay.

366
00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:37.878
How's it hanging?

367
00:30:53.144 --> 00:30:54.979
Good to see you, Kay.

368
00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:58.274
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

369
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:03.779
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

370
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.499
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

371
00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:19.086
Agent Kay.

372
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.797
Greetings, Kay.

373
00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:25.301
Wow, look who's back.

374
00:31:25.468 --> 00:31:28.012
I don't mean to bother you--
You're Agent Kay!

375
00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:31.348
-That's what they tell me.
-This is an honor. Agent Gee.

376
00:31:31.515 --> 00:31:33.976
A legend. The most-respected agent
in MiB history.

377
00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:36.645
The most-feared human
in the universe.

378
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:39.815
Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee?
Hear some war stories?

379
00:31:39.982 --> 00:31:42.651
-Black, two sugars, if you're going.
-An honor.

380
00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:45.946
-Yeah, I'll take a-- My man?
-Good to see you, Kay.

381
00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:49.200
How'd it go?

382
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.869
The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed.

383
00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:53.079
Good work.

384
00:31:53.245 --> 00:31:56.540
Zed, what about that position you
promised me in Men in Black?

385
00:31:56.707 --> 00:32:00.169
Still working on the alien
affirmative-action program.

386
00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:02.546
Wait a minute.
That's not what you promised me.

387
00:32:02.713 --> 00:32:04.840
-You're breaking up.
-Zed? Hello?

388
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:08.636
-I'll call you back.
-I could be Agent Em. Zed, you--

389
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:14.141
Kay, I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

390
00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:17.394
-Well, neither rain, sleet, snow....
-Good man.

391
00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:21.482
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

392
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.776
-Frank?
-Yeah?

393
00:32:23.984 --> 00:32:26.904
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

394
00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:31.033
I need an assistant.
It's not field work, but you get dental.

395
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.701
Dental?

396
00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:39.667
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

397
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:41.001
What's this?

398
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:45.256
All is lost! All is lost!

399
00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:47.925
Don't touch that!

400
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:50.761
I didn't do anything.

401
00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:53.931
Hands in your pockets.

402
00:33:03.524 --> 00:33:05.693
Your favorite weapon.

403
00:33:08.445 --> 00:33:10.865
-That?
-Yep.

404
00:33:11.157 --> 00:33:13.367
-Let's go put it on.
-What?

405
00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:15.828
The last suit you'll ever wear.

406
00:33:15.995 --> 00:33:17.580
Again.

407
00:33:24.628 --> 00:33:26.005
The deneuralyzer.

408
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.634
In a few moments, magneto-energy
will surge through your brain...

409
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.431
...unlocking information that could
hold the key to Earth's very survival.

410
00:33:35.598 --> 00:33:38.225
Okay. What's that thing?

411
00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:41.604
The deneuralyzer.

412
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.442
DUTY-FREE LIQUOR

413
00:33:49.153 --> 00:33:53.157
Welcome to planet Earth.
There are some rules and regulations.

414
00:33:53.324 --> 00:33:54.491
Go out only at night.

415
00:33:54.658 --> 00:33:58.662
If you must go out during the daylight,
only the East Village.

416
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:05.085
Hey, hey, hey!

417
00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:12.176
Name and planet of origin?

418
00:34:12.343 --> 00:34:16.889
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

419
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:21.143
-Any fruits or vegetables?
-Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

420
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.353
Reason for visit?

421
00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:26.023
Education. I really wanna learn
how to be an underwear model.

422
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.943
They told me I've got real potential.

423
00:34:31.487 --> 00:34:33.280
Help! Heart attack!

424
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.950
Clear!

425
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:39.203
Wake up, champ!

426
00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:45.209
Oh, jeez.

427
00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:47.920
Lockdown. Code 101.

428
00:34:48.796 --> 00:34:50.798
Lockdown.

429
00:34:51.674 --> 00:34:54.343
This is not good. This is not good.

430
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:04.019
-Breach! We're being flushed.
-Flushed?

431
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:07.690
-Ever been to a water park?
-I don't know.

432
00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:43.142
Flushed.

433
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:48.480
Yeah, man, back when you was
an agent, you loved getting flushed.

434
00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:53.235
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me."

435
00:35:53.402 --> 00:35:55.154
I'd be like, "No."

436
00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.282
You can't quit on me.

437
00:35:58.449 --> 00:36:01.368
I save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

438
00:36:01.535 --> 00:36:03.078
Cool.

439
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:07.082
-Hop in.
-Hop in what?

440
00:36:13.297 --> 00:36:14.715
Does that come standard?

441
00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:17.593
It came with a black dude,
but he kept getting pulled over.

442
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.053
Yep.

443
00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:26.477
Silly little planet. I could rule the place
with the right set of mammary glands.

444
00:36:26.852 --> 00:36:28.437
Trapped like rats...

445
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:30.230
...in a Chia Pet.

446
00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:32.983
Computer, surveillance MiB.

447
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.615
MiB is locked down.

448
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.287
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

449
00:36:46.455 --> 00:36:48.332
Communicator. Frank.

450
00:36:48.624 --> 00:36:50.959
-Jay, where are you?
-We got flushed.

451
00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:53.295
-MiB is code 101.
-Yeah, who did it?

452
00:36:53.462 --> 00:36:56.423
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

453
00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:01.470
-Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
-Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

454
00:37:01.637 --> 00:37:03.013
-Find Kay?
-Neuralyzed.

455
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.808
-Not active. Civilian.
-What?

456
00:37:05.974 --> 00:37:07.017
-He was--
-Here.

457
00:37:07.184 --> 00:37:08.519
-To get--
-Deneuralyzed.

458
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:13.232
-Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
-Don't put anything in our ears.

459
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:15.192
What?

460
00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:18.821
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

461
00:37:18.987 --> 00:37:21.740
-Yeah, you're smiling.
-Is that the only deneuralyzer?

462
00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:24.827
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

463
00:37:24.993 --> 00:37:26.995
Computer, Internet.

464
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:28.997
Deneuralyzer.

465
00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:35.045
Perfect. It's an old friend.

466
00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:44.847
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

467
00:37:45.013 --> 00:37:47.766
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

468
00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:50.060
My business is banging, dog.

469
00:37:50.561 --> 00:37:53.939
You gotta check out the website.
It's "Jeebsie dot--"

470
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:56.191
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

471
00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.402
We need the deneuralyzer.

472
00:37:58.569 --> 00:38:01.905
-You're kidding.
-The meter's running, Jeebs.

473
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.535
Do you remember me?

474
00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:09.663
Can't say I do.
I'm pretty good with faces. I--

475
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.457
I think I'd remember that.

476
00:38:12.708 --> 00:38:14.751
The great Kay's a neutral.

477
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:19.214
You're between me and my memories.
Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?

478
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:20.716
No.

479
00:38:21.884 --> 00:38:23.385
Fresh out.

480
00:38:24.595 --> 00:38:26.263
Can't help you.

481
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:29.892
Don't got it.

482
00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:42.446
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

483
00:38:42.613 --> 00:38:46.658
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head off.

484
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:48.744
So, what's my incentive?

485
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:53.248
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

486
00:38:56.752 --> 00:38:59.963
Alien prisoners released,
armed and ready for your orders.

487
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.592
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

488
00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:05.594
Now it's the scum's turn.

489
00:39:05.761 --> 00:39:08.222
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

490
00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:12.100
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

491
00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:14.478
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.

492
00:39:14.645 --> 00:39:18.065
Start by finding a deneuralyzer. They're
gonna wanna get his memory back.

493
00:39:18.232 --> 00:39:19.608
Check.

494
00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:22.277
Now.

495
00:39:25.656 --> 00:39:27.616
Jarra, good to see you.

496
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.497
Okay, that should do it.

497
00:39:33.664 --> 00:39:38.043
If I could have your attention while
we go over the safety procedures.

498
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.712
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.

499
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:44.091
If, at any point, during the ride,
you become disoriented...

500
00:39:44.258 --> 00:39:46.843
...there's nothing we can do about it.

501
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.888
Have you removed all your jewelry?

502
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:54.768
-Are you allergic to shellfish?
-Jeebs!

503
00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:57.563
Right, then!
Smoke them if you got them.

504
00:40:04.236 --> 00:40:05.696
Have you ever used this before?

505
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:09.658
I used it to make some
hot-air popcorn. That's about it.

506
00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:12.786
Okay! Let's make it happen, captain!

507
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:09.384
Perfect.

508
00:41:23.065 --> 00:41:25.108
-You're back.
-No.

509
00:41:25.275 --> 00:41:26.693
How'd you know
his head grows back?

510
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.487
It grows back?

511
00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:34.910
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time
I help out a friend.

512
00:41:37.412 --> 00:41:39.915
-Kay, you remember anything?
-Goodbye.

513
00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:41.625
-Kay!
-Kay, wait!

514
00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:46.046
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

515
00:41:46.213 --> 00:41:48.090
Your brain needs to reboot.

516
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:50.676
Give it a minute.

517
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:52.260
Kay!

518
00:41:52.511 --> 00:41:55.597
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

519
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:57.766
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

520
00:41:57.933 --> 00:42:02.479
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

521
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.149
Right over there!

522
00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:10.237
-Where's Kay?
-He's not here! He went--

523
00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:13.782
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

524
00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:17.494
Oh, great. Right in the pie hole.
Now nothing's gonna taste right.

525
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:20.122
-Lower your weapon.
-No.

526
00:42:25.627 --> 00:42:28.171
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

527
00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:31.007
-These guys really need Kay.
-He's a neutral.

528
00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:34.845
-Tell me something we don't know.
-Yeah, tell me something--

529
00:42:35.011 --> 00:42:36.596
I am so sorry.

530
00:42:36.763 --> 00:42:38.724
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

531
00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:44.104
Look, if I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

532
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:46.314
-Now, where is he?
-Where is who?

533
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:47.983
You don't look too good.

534
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:51.653
Yeah, and you look like crap.

535
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:57.284
I take that back. He look like crap.

536
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:01.830
-Bend him!
-Bend him.

537
00:43:01.997 --> 00:43:03.790
Wait, don't bend him.

538
00:43:25.771 --> 00:43:28.064
Hey, honey, how you doing?

539
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:43.455
Damn decent of you.

540
00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:45.332
Don't mention it.

541
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:08.980
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-You don't wanna do that.

542
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:13.109
-Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
-Then he's no good to us.

543
00:44:15.529 --> 00:44:18.240
-Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
-Pineal eye!

544
00:44:21.076 --> 00:44:22.786
Go for the mosh tendrils!

545
00:44:26.873 --> 00:44:28.083
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

546
00:44:33.255 --> 00:44:35.799
-You were in a tight spot.
-I handled it.

547
00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:38.593
-You need a partner.
-I had one. Job got too tough.

548
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.263
I'm back. You got some dust
on your coat.

549
00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:43.306
-So, you got your memory back.
-Yeah.

550
00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.308
-What the hell is going on?
-Don't know.

551
00:44:45.475 --> 00:44:48.562
-Okay. What is the Light of Zartha?
-Never heard of it.

552
00:44:48.728 --> 00:44:49.729
Cool.

553
00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:55.443
If your memory's back, why don't
you remember the Light of Zartha?

554
00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.321
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

555
00:44:58.488 --> 00:45:01.783
-Good plan. What you doing?
-I always do the driving.

556
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.952
-Wait, no.
-I remember that.

557
00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:07.539
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

558
00:45:07.706 --> 00:45:11.251
See, I drive the new hotness.

559
00:45:11.418 --> 00:45:13.128
Old and busted...

560
00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:15.297
...new hotness.

561
00:45:23.763 --> 00:45:26.308
Old busted hotness.

562
00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:29.185
-Serleena, please.
-Been a long time, Zed.

563
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:32.981
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

564
00:45:33.148 --> 00:45:36.568
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

565
00:45:38.737 --> 00:45:40.155
Zed?

566
00:45:40.614 --> 00:45:42.449
Zed? Look at you.

567
00:45:42.616 --> 00:45:45.660
Twenty-five years,
and you're still just such a looker.

568
00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:47.537
Cut out the meat and dairy.

569
00:45:47.704 --> 00:45:51.499
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

570
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:55.462
Oh, so feisty.
Look, Zed, we both need the same thing.

571
00:45:58.173 --> 00:45:59.966
Bring him in.

572
00:46:00.634 --> 00:46:01.718
Don't think so.

573
00:46:01.885 --> 00:46:05.722
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight...

574
00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:08.391
...it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

575
00:46:08.558 --> 00:46:13.480
Here's the deal: I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

576
00:46:13.647 --> 00:46:16.858
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

577
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:22.197
All right, Serleena.

578
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.366
You win.

579
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:30.205
Zed? Is that you?
I could be Agent Em.

580
00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:31.498
Zed. Hello?

581
00:46:42.342 --> 00:46:44.928
So feisty.

582
00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:52.644
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

583
00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:54.521
Right here. Right.

584
00:46:56.523 --> 00:46:58.441
Next right on 37th.

585
00:46:58.608 --> 00:47:01.236
Right here, 30-- 30-- Right!

586
00:47:01.403 --> 00:47:02.988
We're not going back to MiB.

587
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:08.243
Headquarters has been breached.
We need to peel caps and split wigs.

588
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.036
Not ready.

589
00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:13.915
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

590
00:47:14.082 --> 00:47:17.210
I understand that you're a little scared.
I'm a little scared too.

591
00:47:17.377 --> 00:47:19.421
-I'm not scared.
-Me neither.

592
00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:22.424
I-- I just thought we was bonding.

593
00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:26.970
Five years, and still acting like a rookie.
Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

594
00:47:27.137 --> 00:47:31.599
-No wonder Zed brought me back.
-He did it because you messed up.

595
00:47:31.766 --> 00:47:34.477
Your attitude makes for
a stressful environment.

596
00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.732
Tell it to the hand.
Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

597
00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:43.486
Exactly. Serleena thinks I know where the
Light is and broke into MiB to lure me back.

598
00:47:43.653 --> 00:47:45.739
Into a trap.

599
00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:48.450
Which is why we can't
bust in there.

600
00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:51.619
We gotta have a plan.
Where we going? Scene of the crime?

601
00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:55.999
-You're the boss.
-Scene of the crime. That's a left though.

602
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.046
Here it is. I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

603
00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:03.256
Things have changed.
We used to neuralyze witnesses.

604
00:48:03.423 --> 00:48:05.425
See, I-- I'd--

605
00:48:05.592 --> 00:48:07.469
Originally, I'd--

606
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.932
No, I was going to--
I interrogated her.

607
00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:13.975
-Then neuralyzed her?
-What you mean?

608
00:48:13.975 --> 00:48:14.809
-Then neuralyzed her?
-What you mean?

609
00:48:14.976 --> 00:48:20.815
MiB code 773II-1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel--

610
00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:22.859
-Drop that weapon!
-No!

611
00:48:23.026 --> 00:48:24.611
-Jay, I'm-- I'm sorry.
-No.

612
00:48:24.778 --> 00:48:27.739
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.

613
00:48:27.906 --> 00:48:30.533
Kay, my partner. Laura, the witness.

614
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.826
Pleasure.

615
00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:36.539
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

616
00:48:36.706 --> 00:48:37.707
That was really sweet.

617
00:48:37.874 --> 00:48:39.876
MiB procedural code 594-B...

618
00:48:40.043 --> 00:48:43.129
...States MiB personnel shall never
be used for any other purpose--

619
00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:45.381
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.

620
00:48:45.548 --> 00:48:48.718
So I'm assuming that
the perp was over in this direction.

621
00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:50.470
Ben.

622
00:48:50.637 --> 00:48:53.473
-Was he 5'7", portly fellow, thinning hair?
-You knew him?

623
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.142
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

624
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:58.228
That is a hell of a fish.

625
00:49:01.189 --> 00:49:03.191
Wait a minute.

626
00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:09.739
You left yourself clues?

627
00:49:09.906 --> 00:49:13.993
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

628
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.330
Well, if the joker
that had got deneuralyzed hadn't created...

629
00:49:17.497 --> 00:49:20.083
-...the situation in the first place--
-Boys.

630
00:49:22.085 --> 00:49:25.171
All right. You pointing at something.

631
00:49:27.799 --> 00:49:28.925
Okay.

632
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.677
Excuse me.

633
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:33.805
The astronaut.

634
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.558
Jay?

635
00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:39.352
Okay, all right. He's pointing--

636
00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:41.479
He's like:

637
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.025
Who would stack
pizza boxes like this?

638
00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:50.113
A pizza-box stacker who's not
stacking pizza boxes. He's leaving clues.

639
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.698
It's an arrow.

640
00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:58.121
-Jay?
-You're slowing me down, slick.

641
00:49:58.288 --> 00:50:01.916
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

642
00:50:03.293 --> 00:50:05.503
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

643
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:12.093
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

644
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:15.555
Good work, partner. Yeah.

645
00:50:15.722 --> 00:50:18.016
-We gotta figure out where it goes.
-I know where.

646
00:50:18.183 --> 00:50:23.104
-Whoa, Kay-- No. Not yet.
-MiB code 773 clearly says--

647
00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:26.441
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

648
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:29.569
To us. Well, for help. To help us later.

649
00:50:30.236 --> 00:50:32.447
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

650
00:50:35.408 --> 00:50:38.119
-You can stay with friends of mine.
-People like you?

651
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.622
Kind of.

652
00:50:40.788 --> 00:50:42.373
Jay!

653
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.043
-Low bridge!
-What's going on, man?

654
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:48.463
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

655
00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:50.465
-Bad.
-Very bad.

656
00:50:50.632 --> 00:50:54.677
-I need your help. This is Laura.
-Laura!

657
00:50:54.844 --> 00:50:56.471
Easy, easy!

658
00:50:56.638 --> 00:50:58.598
-They're worms.
-Once you go worm...

659
00:50:58.765 --> 00:51:01.142
...that's what you'll yearn.

660
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:04.646
-That's what they say. They just:
-I've dated worse.

661
00:51:05.188 --> 00:51:07.815
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free shop.

662
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.777
-We were framed.
-Zed's wormophobic.

663
00:51:10.944 --> 00:51:12.111
-Kay!
-You're back!

664
00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:14.489
-They said you were dead.
-We're double-parked.

665
00:51:14.656 --> 00:51:17.200
Yeah. Laura's very important to me.

666
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:21.496
To us. To the stuff--
Me and you, man. The stuff we doing.

667
00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:25.667
-Keep an eye on her.
-I'll keep both on her.

668
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:26.834
No problem!

669
00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:28.878
Hey, hey, hey!

670
00:51:29.045 --> 00:51:31.839
-Why don't you sit here?
-Oh, yeah. Like you got a shot.

671
00:51:32.006 --> 00:51:33.174
Hey, shut up!

672
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:39.013
My communicator, in case you need it.

673
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.019
-Nice move.
-Okay.

674
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:50.733
-Just watch out for Neeble.
-Which one's Neeble?

675
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.360
He's....

676
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:55.405
-Which one of y'all is Neeble?
-Yo, mama!

677
00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:59.784
Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

678
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:01.119
Don't fall asleep.

679
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:05.248
Twister!

680
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:11.838
Can you run over your plan
one more time? I'm struggling with it.

681
00:52:12.005 --> 00:52:16.050
You neuralyzed memory of the Light
but left yourself clues if you came back?

682
00:52:16.217 --> 00:52:17.927
-Right.
-Photo in an old suit...

683
00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:22.015
...pointing to a key on a nail in a pizzeria,
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

684
00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:24.767
-Right.
-And in the locker, we'll find another clue.

685
00:52:24.934 --> 00:52:26.728
That's the plan.

686
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.775
-I like to keep my enemies confused.
-We all confused, Kay.

687
00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:36.654
You're not gonna slow me down,
are you?

688
00:52:36.821 --> 00:52:39.490
Slow you down? Who's brain's
working on outdated software?

689
00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:41.784
Why don't you go
grab us some coffee?

690
00:52:41.951 --> 00:52:45.455
Oh, sure. How do you take it?
Black? Couple cubes of "kiss my ass"?

691
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:49.042
I don't know what's in there,
I don't want you to get hurt, so step back.

692
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:52.628
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

693
00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.635
Kay! He's back! The light giver!

694
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:02.305
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

695
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.559
Oh, Kay, can you see
By the dawn's early light

696
00:53:06.726 --> 00:53:09.562
You are the man who would be king
of the train locker.

697
00:53:09.729 --> 00:53:10.730
Praise Kay!

698
00:53:10.897 --> 00:53:12.231
Oh, good and gentle townfolk
of Locker C-18...

699
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:15.610
Oh, good and gentle townfolk
of Locker C-18...

700
00:53:15.777 --> 00:53:19.197
-...did I leave anything here?
-Yes. The timekeeper.

701
00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:22.283
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

702
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.954
-I've been looking everywhere for this.
-Merciful one! The clock tower!

703
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.832
I got y'all, it's cool. Check this out.

704
00:53:29.999 --> 00:53:33.169
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.

705
00:53:33.795 --> 00:53:36.506
-That's banging, right?
-Who are you, stranger?

706
00:53:37.006 --> 00:53:38.383
Jay.

707
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:41.219
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

708
00:53:41.386 --> 00:53:43.721
Oh, Jay, can you see

709
00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:46.974
-Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of--
-Come on.

710
00:53:47.475 --> 00:53:49.644
-Wait! The commandments!
-The tablet!

711
00:53:49.811 --> 00:53:52.855
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

712
00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:57.068
We have lived by its word, and peace
has reigned throughout our world.

713
00:53:57.235 --> 00:54:00.655
Pass it on to others!
So that they too may be enlightened!

714
00:54:00.822 --> 00:54:02.490
Be kind! Rewind!

715
00:54:02.657 --> 00:54:04.492
Go back, and reconcile your past...

716
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:07.328
...in order to move tranquilly
into your future!

717
00:54:07.495 --> 00:54:09.831
Two for one every Wednesday.

718
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:13.376
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

719
00:54:13.543 --> 00:54:14.710
Every Wednesday.

720
00:54:14.877 --> 00:54:17.672
Large adult-entertainment section
in the back.

721
00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.006
Yeah.

722
00:54:21.968 --> 00:54:23.678
That's just nasty.

723
00:54:24.512 --> 00:54:26.764
-What's up with the video card?
-I don't know.

724
00:54:26.931 --> 00:54:28.558
-Why leave the watch?
-To remind me.

725
00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:29.892
-Of what?
-Can't remember.

726
00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:31.060
Guess.

727
00:54:31.227 --> 00:54:35.064
I guess we have till midnight, That's 59
minutes and 37 seconds to figure it out.

728
00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:42.238
Look. Here's an idea. How about
we stop chasing butt-backwards clues...

729
00:54:42.405 --> 00:54:45.992
...go get a couple fission carbonizers
and get our headquarters back.

730
00:54:46.159 --> 00:54:48.077
It's all about to make sense, kid.

731
00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:50.163
Is this card valid?

732
00:54:51.873 --> 00:54:55.710
-This card hasn't been used in years.
-I've been away on business.

733
00:54:55.877 --> 00:54:58.212
-Billions of frequent-flier miles.
-Try and use them.

734
00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:02.341
I wanted to go to Cambodia.
You can get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

735
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.719
The airlines said
they black out holidays.

736
00:55:04.886 --> 00:55:07.763
You have to stay over a weekend.
It's a conspiracy.

737
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.641
-Why would somebody--?
-Can you tell us about the account?

738
00:55:11.392 --> 00:55:13.352
Only that you never
checked out a tape.

739
00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:16.397
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

740
00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:19.817
-Hey, Newton.
-There's a huge rat in the toilet.

741
00:55:19.984 --> 00:55:24.238
It's all stopped up.
You're gonna have to pee in the sin--

742
00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:30.411
-Still think I'm paranoid?
-Yeah.

743
00:55:31.204 --> 00:55:34.790
Gentlemen, my name is Newton.
I run the place.

744
00:55:34.957 --> 00:55:36.667
Seen any aliens lately?

745
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:40.838
-You need professional help, son.
-He's getting it. It's not working.

746
00:55:41.047 --> 00:55:43.466
Okay, so, new case, huh?

747
00:55:43.633 --> 00:55:45.968
"Episode 27, Light of Zartha."

748
00:55:47.595 --> 00:55:48.930
Got it.

749
00:55:49.555 --> 00:55:53.309
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

750
00:55:53.476 --> 00:55:57.438
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

751
00:55:57.605 --> 00:55:59.565
They're touchy about
this global warming.

752
00:55:59.732 --> 00:56:03.569
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

753
00:56:03.736 --> 00:56:07.198
-Do it, I'll give you whatever you want.
-Give me Jay. We'll call it even.

754
00:56:07.365 --> 00:56:08.783
Groovy.

755
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:11.452
You've got till midnight.

756
00:56:15.498 --> 00:56:19.085
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

757
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:26.425
Newton? Newton, is that you?

758
00:56:26.592 --> 00:56:29.095
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

759
00:56:29.262 --> 00:56:30.846
I wanna have your baby.

760
00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:33.182
Would you like some mini-pizza?

761
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:37.770
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

762
00:56:37.937 --> 00:56:40.523
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

763
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.401
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.

764
00:56:43.568 --> 00:56:46.487
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

765
00:56:52.076 --> 00:56:54.412
No, thanks. We're cool.

766
00:56:54.579 --> 00:56:56.205
All right.

767
00:56:57.498 --> 00:56:59.500
Over here.

768
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:05.047
This is it.

769
00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:07.425
-Finally, some hard evidence.
-Yes.

770
00:57:07.592 --> 00:57:11.554
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

771
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:13.848
What's up with anal probing?

772
00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:17.935
I mean, aliens travel billions
of light years just to check out our--

773
00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:20.354
Boy, move.

774
00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:23.441
Okay. Just a question.

775
00:57:24.483 --> 00:57:28.070
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened”...

776
00:57:28.237 --> 00:57:32.742
...from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

777
00:57:33.492 --> 00:57:38.998
1978. Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years.

778
00:57:39.165 --> 00:57:40.458
Looks like Spielberg's work.

779
00:57:40.625 --> 00:57:44.587
But the Zarthans had
a great treasure, the Light of Zartha.

780
00:57:44.754 --> 00:57:47.923
A source of power so awesome,
it alone...

781
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:51.510
...could mean victory
and restoration for the Zarthans...

782
00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:56.390
...or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians.

783
00:57:56.557 --> 00:58:00.686
A group of Zarthans made the journey,
led by the Keeper of the Light...

784
00:58:00.853 --> 00:58:02.271
Lauranna.

785
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.857
...Princess Lauranna.

786
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:08.944
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth.

787
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:12.198
But they could not intervene.

788
00:58:12.365 --> 00:58:14.200
No.

789
00:58:14.367 --> 00:58:15.409
It was night.

790
00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:19.080
And it was raining.

791
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:21.207
You've been very wise.

792
00:58:21.374 --> 00:58:25.878
Kay, please. If Serleena takes
the Light, it's the end of our world.

793
00:58:26.504 --> 00:58:29.924
Madam Ambassador, if we extend
protection for the Light beyond Earth...

794
00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:33.427
...we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.

795
00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:36.180
-Where is it?
-We're neutral, remember?

796
00:58:36.389 --> 00:58:38.599
If you want it, go get it.

797
00:58:42.812 --> 00:58:44.313
No!

798
00:59:13.467 --> 00:59:15.761
And so never knowing it happened...

799
00:59:15.928 --> 00:59:18.848
...the people of Earth
were once again saved...

800
00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:22.143
...by a secret society of protectors--

801
00:59:23.269 --> 00:59:24.937
I shouldn't have.

802
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:28.315
You never sent it off the planet.

803
00:59:29.442 --> 00:59:30.860
You hid it here.

804
00:59:32.862 --> 00:59:34.280
The worm guys.

805
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.370
Are you one of Newton's
friends from group therapy?

806
00:59:41.537 --> 00:59:45.916
-Yes, ma'am, I am. Look here, please.
-Would you like some mini-pizz--?

807
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:48.544
A neuralyz--

808
00:59:49.587 --> 00:59:53.174
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

809
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.634
Because...joints look like
they can pick up cable.

810
00:59:55.801 --> 01:00:00.389
Second, take her to Cambodia.
Get her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

811
01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:03.517
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia...

812
01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:07.062
...move your bum-ass
out of your mom's house.

813
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.648
-Let's go.
-Boy, you like 40 years old.

814
01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:12.234
-Agent Jay?
-All right, all right.

815
01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:16.238
And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

816
01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:25.706
-You wanna go to Cambodia?
-Yeah.

817
01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.627
Hey, Mom?

818
01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:31.921
Communicator, Jay.

819
01:00:32.797 --> 01:00:35.591
-Laura, it's me.
-Jay, we're playing Twister.

820
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.551
What's up, Jay?

821
01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:41.013
-Quit touching my butt!
-Sorry. I thought it was your face.

822
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.225
They're really good at this.
They don't have any spines.

823
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.353
They were telling me about Oprah,
from Chicago.

824
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.731
Maybe landed in Chicago.

825
01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.859
-Are you wearing a bracelet?
-Yeah.

826
01:00:54.026 --> 01:00:55.069
Is it glowing?

827
01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:03.202
-It's never done that before.
-We're on our way.

828
01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:04.912
Communicator, Frank.

829
01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:07.331
Frank, get down
to sub-control level C.

830
01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:10.793
Deactivate lockdown. We're headed
to the worm guys. We found the Light.

831
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.587
Got it, Jay. Scrad?

832
01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:14.964
Bitch.

833
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.091
Why didn't you say "Il love you"?

834
01:01:17.258 --> 01:01:20.845
-He's a dog. I don't even like him.
-No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

835
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.639
-Hey, Kay--
-That's why you didn't neuralyze her.

836
01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.224
You got emotionally involved.

837
01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:29.895
-Like you did with Lauranna?
-I put the entire planet in danger.

838
01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.315
I don't wanna see you
making my mistakes.

839
01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:34.984
Whatever, man.

840
01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:40.865
Laura?

841
01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:49.331
Damn!

842
01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.004
Never stood half a chance.

843
01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.298
Oh, boy.

844
01:01:58.424 --> 01:01:59.717
That's gonna leave a scar.

845
01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.762
-Where's Laura?
-MiB headquarters.

846
01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.765
-Some dumb two-headed guy.
-They got the bracelet.

847
01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:09.977
We got 39 minutes. You guys...

848
01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:12.271
...pull yourselves together.

849
01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:14.148
Damn.

850
01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:17.610
That's feeling better.

851
01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:20.487
-Hey, guys, wait up!
-Let me grab my drink!

852
01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.656
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

853
01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.033
She also wants me.

854
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:27.369
-What's the book say?
-We're off book. I say split some wigs.

855
01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.830
-We need wig-splitting weapons.
-Got them.

856
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.464
Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.

857
01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:41.675
Paw Paw and ZuZu love
to see what's going on in the garden.

858
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:46.180
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

859
01:02:50.142 --> 01:02:52.144
Nice place.

860
01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.908
See you.

861
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:18.170
You did not see a room
full of shiny weapons or four aliens.

862
01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:21.048
You will cherish and love each other
for the rest of your lives.

863
01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:25.219
Which could be the next 27 or 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

864
01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:28.097
And she can stay up as late
as she want and have cookies...

865
01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.849
...and candy and cakes
and junk and stuff.

866
01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.946
Four minutes to launch.

867
01:03:44.113 --> 01:03:46.031
Four minutes to launch.

868
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.661
-Your ship is ready.
-Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

869
01:03:54.123 --> 01:03:55.374
Ready, guys?

870
01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.751
Lock and load, baby.

871
01:03:57.918 --> 01:03:59.461
-You ready, kid?
-"Kid"?

872
01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:03.048
While you were licking stamps,
I saved the world from a Kreelon invasion.

873
01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:07.011
They're the Backstreet Boys of
the universe. They throw snowballs?

874
01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.388
-You know what you're doing?
-Yep.

875
01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.057
I'm about to attack one
of the most-feared aliens...

876
01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:14.268
...with four worms and a mailman.

877
01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:17.354
-Let's make it hot.
-No, no, wait!

878
01:04:23.152 --> 01:04:25.446
A code-101 lockdown!

879
01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:29.658
I know. The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

880
01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.869
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!

881
01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.328
You got it.

882
01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:41.920
It's about time you guys got here.

883
01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:45.382
That pretty lady in there
is causing all kinds of hell.

884
01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:09.114
Oh, yummy. Someone I need to eat.

885
01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:11.909
Get to the launch pad.
The bracelet shows the departure point.

886
01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:15.370
-No matter what, do not come back for me.
-What do you mean?

887
01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:18.248
Do not come back for me.

888
01:05:22.503 --> 01:05:26.507
-Worm guys, give me some cover fire.
-Too scared, can't move.

889
01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.476
Go!

890
01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:51.115
-Limber.
-Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

891
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:55.661
-Shut off power so they can't take off.
-Can't. Too scared.

892
01:05:57.746 --> 01:06:00.374
-Oh, that way.
-Away from the bullets.

893
01:06:00.541 --> 01:06:02.000
No problem.

894
01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.600
Nice to see you again, Kay.

895
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.898
-Three minutes to launch.
-Jay!

896
01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:26.275
Three minutes to launch.

897
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.361
Hello, Jay. Long time.

898
01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:32.030
Jarra! What's up, man?
Wow, you look great.

899
01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.825
-What's it been? Five years?
-And 42 days, thanks to you.

900
01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:37.411
You count every one
when you're locked away.

901
01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:41.707
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

902
01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.459
Over our dead titanium bodies!

903
01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.004
Two minutes.

904
01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.470
Let's play this one by ear.

905
01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.434
I should've vaporized you when
I had the chance.

906
01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:02.436
You really did love Lauranna.

907
01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:03.812
Didn't you, Kay?

908
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:06.940
You silly little man.

909
01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:37.221
Two minutes to launch.

910
01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.557
Just go, I'll be fine!

911
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:43.894
What you talking about, girl?
I'm winning.

912
01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:48.190
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly...

913
01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:51.068
...and for making that many copies.
Now surrender!

914
01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.195
I want him in pieces.

915
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:58.116
Jarra Jr. is going, going...

916
01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.661
...gone!

917
01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.926
-Rectum.
-Damn near killed him!

918
01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:17.928
-Never get tired of that one.
-I'll say.

919
01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.597
-Guys, where do we shut off the power?
-I don't know.

920
01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:30.524
-Laura, I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
-No, he won't.

921
01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:38.115
Down to one now, Jarra!

922
01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.961
Thirty seconds to launch.

923
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.680
Fifteen seconds to launch.

924
01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.351
Ten seconds to launch.

925
01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:07.686
Eight...

926
01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:09.354
...seven...

927
01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:10.689
...SiX...

928
01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:12.357
...five...

929
01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:13.692
...four...

930
01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:14.985
...three...

931
01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:16.570
...two--

932
01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:19.948
Launch terminated.

933
01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:22.117
What did you mean, "leave you"?
I never run from a fight.

934
01:09:22.284 --> 01:09:23.702
-Well, he took your gun.
-Yeah.

935
01:09:23.869 --> 01:09:26.621
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

936
01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:30.876
-Half the time, you were on your back.
-Look, that's how I fight.

937
01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:32.044
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

938
01:09:32.044 --> 01:09:34.046
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

939
01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.299
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

940
01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:41.553
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

941
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.891
I'll give you one last chance
to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

942
01:09:46.058 --> 01:09:49.561
-What are you gonna do to stop me?
-Not me. Him.

943
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:53.690
Your flight's been canceled.

944
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:05.160
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing....

945
01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.370
Yeah.

946
01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.916
-Worms!
-Sorry.

947
01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:18.215
-Give me the bracelet. Please?
-I'm going with you.

948
01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:21.009
-Everybody in the car. Everybody.
-I don't think she--

949
01:10:34.523 --> 01:10:37.442
I can't believe this bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

950
01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.361
It's often something small like that.

951
01:10:39.528 --> 01:10:41.029
It's not the Light.

952
01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.115
-It tells us the departure point.
-What?

953
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:46.159
If we don't get there in
11 minutes and 15 seconds...

954
01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:48.870
...that bracelet's gonna go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

955
01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.414
What?

956
01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:52.582
Hello.

957
01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:55.544
-Wait, Kay, no. Kay, no.
-I know what I'm doing.

958
01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:11.768
Damn.

959
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.897
-Modified to hyper-speed!
-Seat belts.

960
01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:20.402
What's that?

961
01:11:20.569 --> 01:11:24.030
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

962
01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:31.705
Toggle switches for the ailerons.
Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

963
01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:34.166
Okay.

964
01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:39.504
I just want you to know--

965
01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:42.549
You know what?
Hold on to that for me for one second.

966
01:11:45.469 --> 01:11:47.137
Computer, worms.

967
01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:51.725
So I said, "Bitch, if you don't want me
to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass...

968
01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:56.354
-...turn around and exit the planet."
-Frank, where are you?

969
01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.981
Main hall, egg display.

970
01:11:58.148 --> 01:12:01.026
Lost control. We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

971
01:12:01.193 --> 01:12:05.030
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

972
01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:11.912
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

973
01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:14.331
Godspeed.

974
01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:16.500
Frank? Frank?

975
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:20.253
-Frank?
-Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

976
01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:25.634
-It is not automatic piloting.
-He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

977
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.222
-I could really use a steering wheel here!
-We don't have one. This is what we got.

978
01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.976
-Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
-What is a Game Boy?

979
01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:37.604
-You know what? Move. Move.
-Okay.

980
01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.273
Oh, hey.
That is not the navigational stalk!

981
01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:54.496
Okay, straight down.

982
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.585
Idiots.

983
01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:12.931
Subway may not be the best place
to lose her.

984
01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.102
-Where is he?
"He"?

985
01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.770
Jeff. Hang on!

986
01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.568
Teeth.

987
01:13:58.226 --> 01:14:01.354
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

988
01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:03.648
Right here.

989
01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:07.319
-What?
-What, I'm the Light?

990
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.905
-No. No way.
-You have a planet to save. Laura.

991
01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:13.783
You've got me confused with somebody.
I work part-time at a pizzeria.

992
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.579
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

993
01:14:17.746 --> 01:14:20.915
Laura, you are the Light.

994
01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:24.836
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

995
01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:27.714
The power is within you
to save a planet.

996
01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:32.677
I protected you until it was your time.
Your time is now.

997
01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:37.932
You are going to save a world.

998
01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:40.393
-I can't be--
-You know things before they happen.

999
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.687
-I'm a Libra.
-You're Zarthan.

1000
01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:46.983
-When you get sad, it rains.
-Lots of people get sad when it rains.

1001
01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:49.986
It rains because you're sad, baby.

1002
01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.916
It's not fair.

1003
01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:52.465
Never is.

1004
01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:55.677
We are who we are...

1005
01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:58.388
...even if we sometimes forget.

1006
01:16:07.647 --> 01:16:10.024
Jeff, I am so not in the mood for you!

1007
01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.360
Get back in the subway right now!

1008
01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.118
That's not good.

1009
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:23.621
Wait! No!

1010
01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.374
Jay!

1011
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.379
I cannot emphasize strongly enough how
much we need you on that transport.

1012
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:35.133
Laura, you have to go!

1013
01:16:35.467 --> 01:16:37.010
Oh, jeez.

1014
01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.681
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

1015
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.225
Nope!

1016
01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:49.314
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

1017
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:52.066
Laura, it's your destiny!

1018
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.235
I was talking, Kay!

1019
01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:58.531
Hey! No biting.

1020
01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:00.992
If you don't go, we all die.

1021
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.415
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

1022
01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:17.425
Kay? A little help?

1023
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.230
Kay?

1024
01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.609
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

1025
01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:02.846
-Kid?
-Yeah.

1026
01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:06.474
-Thanks for bringing me back.
-No problem.

1027
01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:08.268
Why didn't you tell me?

1028
01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:09.978
Would you have let her go?

1029
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.337
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

1030
01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:37.922
It's nice.

1031
01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:41.926
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

1032
01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.515
I did miss this city.

1033
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.270
So Laura is Princess Lauranna's
daughter.

1034
01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:57.609
-Did y'all--?
-MiB is a mess. Let's go, kid.

1035
01:18:58.443 --> 01:18:59.652
"Let's go"?

1036
01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:03.656
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey just saw our little event.

1037
01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:06.951
Plan needs to be thought out.
Plan needs to be cool.

1038
01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:08.536
What you--?

1039
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:15.293
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

1040
01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.003
I want one of those.

1041
01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:18.546
Damn!

1042
01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.469
-Hey.
-Hey.

1043
01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:27.055
-How you doing? Good.
-I'm good, man.

1044
01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:31.768
We've all been there, kid. The girl is gone,
and it hurts. You wanna talk?

1045
01:19:31.935 --> 01:19:33.478
-No.
-l can help.

1046
01:19:33.645 --> 01:19:34.687
No.

1047
01:19:34.854 --> 01:19:35.897
Still sulking?

1048
01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:37.148
-No.
-Yeah.

1049
01:19:37.315 --> 01:19:41.444
Hell, you miss her. It happens to all of us.
There was a hot young thing I knew once.

1050
01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:45.239
When our bodies were entwined
in the positions of the Kama Sutra--

1051
01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.699
Zed!

1052
01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:48.952
Come on, man! Damn!

1053
01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.120
Jay, I'll tell you something
about dames.

1054
01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.791
They say they want to be scratched,
but they really want is:

1055
01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.668
Hey, Frank.

1056
01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:59.420
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

1057
01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.130
No. No advice.

1058
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:02.715
No talking.

1059
01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:04.884
Hell, no.

1060
01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:08.262
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.

1061
01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:11.891
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

1062
01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:15.979
-I brought them from Grand Central.
-Why you put them rats in my locker?

1063
01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:18.439
I thought it would put things
in perspective.

1064
01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:21.442
Kay, it's actually kind of sad.
We need to let them out.

1065
01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.695
I mean, they need to know the world
is bigger than that.

1066
01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:26.406
Still a rookie.
