Hannah, I know you're in there.

13
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.309
You have to fight, baby.

14
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.641
Fight it, Hannah.

15
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.686
Fight it. Fight it, Hannah.

16
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.985
You have to fight.

17
00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.321
Baby, it's me.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.416
- Dad.
- Daddy's here, baby.

19
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.997
- Dad.
- Honey. Baby.

20
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.787
Dad.

21
00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.876
You have to fight.

22
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.930

She's mine forever.

28

to Dr. Lewis and you're good to go...</i>

You look nervous. Are you okay?

33
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.026
It's a job interview.
I think I'm supposed to be nervous.

34
00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.035
Okay. Come on, let's go get a coffee.

35
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.286
<i>This will be good.</i>

36
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.870
We'll go to meetings in the morning
after our shifts end and...

37
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.912
...I'll be three floors up,
so if you need anything...

38
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.791
You know?

39
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.673
Thank you for this.

40
00:06:55.832 --> 00:07:00.087
Don't thank me yet.
You still have to meet Dr. Lewis.

41
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.051
<i>This job is not for everyone.</i>

42
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:05.592
We've had three overnight intake
assistants in the last six months alone.

43
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.011
Because of the hours?

44
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.350
No, because it's a thankless,
solitary position.

45
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.810
The smell. You never get used
to the smell.

46
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.852
I was a cop.
I'm totally used to bad smells.

47
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.363
Lisa mentioned that there were issues.

48
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.822
Yes. There were issues.
But I'm much better now.

49
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:26.906
Well, she assured me
that you could handle the job.

50
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.828
Is it something you think
you can handle?

51
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.368
I can handle it.

52
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.086
<i>Going down.</i>

53
00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:43.297
It gets to you after a while, being here.
People get creeped out.

54
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.304
Before you know it,
their imaginations are running wild...

55
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.094
...hearing things go bump
in the night.

56
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.807
Not me.

57
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.769
I believe when you die, you die.

58
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:55.775
End of story.

59
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.194
Good.

<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

61
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:05.740
At night, you can't get in or out
without swiping this card.

62
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:10.624
If you lose it, hospital security has
to let you in. They will not be happy.

63
00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:17.756
Most of the lights are on a sensor.
The rest you have to switch on manually.

64
00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.051
There are a lot of files that need
to be entered into the system.

65
00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:28.638
- I hope you don't mind data entry.
- No, not at all.

66
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.183
Men's room is down there,
women's room is down there...

67
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:36.350
...and down there to the left is
the incinerator room for cremation.

68
00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.644
<i>Intake bay.</i>

69
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:43.023
This intake bay is for drop-offs only.

70
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.612
No drop-off, no access.

71
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.279
And you never leave the premises
while you're on duty. No exceptions.

72
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.285
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

73
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.997
Well, you bring the cadaver up
from the intake bay...

74
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.129
...and take it into the receiving room,
which is over here.

75
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:58.584
<i>Image captured.</i>

76
00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.591
First you take an overview of the body
and then close-ups...

77
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.172
...of each individual injury.

78
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.671
- Image captured.
- All right, you try.

79
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.927
Rigor mortis makes
a corpse difficult to fingerprint.

80
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:14.721
Now, if you press on the knuckle,
it will extend the finger...

81
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.265
...and make it easier to handle.

82
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.817
Gently roll.

Green means they're ready to go.
Red means they're not.

86
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.113
Yeah.

87
00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.823

88
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.576

89
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:40.004
- Thanks, Moe.
- You bet, Doc.

90
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:44.213
The shift starts tomorrow night at 11,
goes to 7 in the morning.

91
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:46.503
- Any problems with that?
- Not at all.

92
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.263
Well, thank you for the opportunity.

93
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.550

- In the morgue. I'm Megan.

98
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.375

Yeah, I'm basically running
the place at night, all on my own.

149
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.803
Are you sure that's a good idea,
you know...

150
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.683
...spending so much time alone
right now?

151
00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:58.221
Actually, I do. You know,
it keeps me from going out at night...

152
00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.139
...doing things I might regret
in the morning.

153
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.059

-"Lisa"?
- My AA sponsor.

155

The nurse at the hospital.

156
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.323
She says it keeps her out of trouble
working the night shift.

157
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:15.196
So, when a job opened up at the morgue,
she thought of me.

158
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:19.209
Yeah, still, too much time alone
is never good for anyone.

<i>Thanks for the heads-up.
Yeah, we get that a lot.</i>

178
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.618
Yeah.

179
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:34.343
<i>Arrived at intake bay.</i>

180
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:44.474
<i>fies-om
'HEW. yeah.</i>

181
00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:46.847
You're new here.

182
00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.982
- Megan.
- Randy.

183
00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:52.311
Could you give me a hand?
I'm all alone tonight.

184
00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:55.235
Sorry. I can't leave the premises.

185
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:59.406
Yes. Yeah. Stickler on the rules.

186
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.538
But I'll tell you right now...

187
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.450
...if you don't help me get
this thing inside...

188
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:09.587
...it's going to start to rot and decay.
It's just going to blow up like a puffer fish.

189
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.248
And then we're both going
to lose our jobs.

190
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.293
Unless...

191
00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.045
- What do you think?
- All right, okay. Fine.

192
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

193
00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:23.973
You're the best.
My partner called in sick. Strep throat.

194
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.637
Which is 100 percent
grade-A bullshit because--

195
00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:28.101
- Do you want to grab that side?
- Yeah.

196
00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:32.064
He is holing up
with his psycho ex-girlfriend.

197
00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:35.230
It seems like he should be making
some new friends.

198
00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:39.572
Yeah, I think he should probably pick
a better psycho ex-girlfriend next time.

199
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.408
So, I want to say thank you,
by the way...

200
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:47.496
...because the guy who used to have
this job would never have just done that.

201
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.336
He was a prick. Horrendous breath.

202
00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:53.338
- How long have you been here?
- I just started.

203
00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:58.135
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

204
00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:04.558
- What happened?
- Oh, yeah, it's a bad one.

205
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:08.062
The cops found her in an alley.
One, two, three.

206
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.597
Yeah.

207
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.479
Yeah, so the guy was still slicing her.

208
00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:15.770
He took off.
They still haven't found him.

209
00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:19.065
- Did they find out who he was?
- No clue.

210
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.490
"Hannah Grace."

211
00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:26.280
Yeah, that's what it said on her l.D.

212
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.632
I told you it was bad.

213
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.634
That's not even the insane thing.
The insane thing is...

214
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:42.342
...they found chloroform by her body.

215
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:47.142
What kind of a lunatic drugs a girl,
smashes her head in...

216
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:50.646
...and then tries to burn her body
after she's been dead?

217
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:54.767
I'll tell you who it is.
It's someone trying to send a message.

218
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:57.858
It could have been her pimp.
It might have been a drug dealer.

219
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.866
It could have been a sex thing.

220
00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:05.699
- Thanks, Randy. I can take it from here.
- You got it. Yeah.

221
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.534
All right.

222
00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.712
Thanks for the help, Megan.

223
00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:16.630
Yeah.

224
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:20.592
- Intake bay.
- It gets easier. I promise.

225
00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.629
Thanks.

226
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:25.924

It's freaking hot.

Dave, you promised.

Dave!

Oh, my God.

- Yes.

00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:45.023
Do you understand?

253
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.153
- Come <i>on.
- Security.</i>

254
00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:24.938
There's someone down here.
Call the police now.

255
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:26.482
<i>What?</i>

256
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:08.316
"As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

257

And lead us not into temptation...

258
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.028
...but deliver us from evil."

259
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:16.448
Stop. Put the body down.

260
00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:19.414
I've already called security.
There's nowhere for you to go.

261
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:28.419
- Now, just stay calm.
- You don't understand.

262
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:29.802
Megan!

263
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.554
Megan!

264
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:33.260
Megan!

265
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:45.936
Get off of me! Get off of me!

266
00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:47.649
Please, listen to me!

267
00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:51.274
- You've got to destroy her body.
- Get him up!

268
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:53.739
- You're coming with us.
- Please, listen to me.

269
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:55.279
- Listen. Listen.
- Are you okay?

270
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:58.198
You have to destroy her body.
You've got to destroy her body.

271
00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:01.539
You don't know what you've done!

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.830
You don't know what you--
She's not dead!

273
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.543
Stop.

274
00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:42.640
Hello?

275
00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:46.773
<i>Megan, it's Andrew. I just heard
what happened. Are you okay?</i>

276
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:50.231
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I'm going to have to call you back.

277
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:44.615
Hey, can you open the door?

278
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.123
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

279
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:52.664
- Did that guy hurt you?
- No. No, not really.

280
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.425
- I'm fine.
- Do you want to call it a night?

281
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:57.005
I can find someone else
to cover your shift.

282
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.136
I'm okay. Seriously, Lisa, I'm fine.

283
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.798
Nobody is going to hold it against you
if you just want to get out of here.

284
00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:06.015
I know. But I want to stay. Okay?
I can do this. I want to do this.

285
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.975
- But you don't have to.
- Lisa.

286
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.649
I need to do this.

287
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:17.234
Okay.

288
00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.823
What is it?

289
00:39:26.155 --> 00:39:29.284
I know this is going
to sound insane, but...

290
00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:34.874
I heard a corpse breathe.

291
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.585
- Breathe?
- Yes.

292
00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:40.219
Like...

293
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.346
...an exhale.

294
00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:48.099
Corpses expunge air sometimes
when they're moved.

295
00:39:48.261 --> 00:39:50.730
Dr. Lewis didn't tell you this?

296
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:55.231
In his defense, he...

297
00:39:55.685 --> 00:40:00.282
...probably assumed I was smart enough
to know that corpses can't breathe.

298
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.368
Are you hungry?

299
00:40:04.527 --> 00:40:06.700
I can get us some take-out
from the cafeteria.

300
00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.749
- Sure.
- Okay, come on.

301
00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.173
You know,
when that guy attacked me tonight...

302
00:40:22.712 --> 00:40:25.556
...my first instinct wasn't to run.

303
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.807
You know, I wanted to defend myself...

304
00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:31.596
...to stop him.

305
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:33.978
I didn't freeze.

306
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:39.112
Why couldn't I have done that when
there was a gun pointed at my partner?

307
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.693
And then none of this
would have happened.

308
00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:45.402
Look, it's just one step at a time.

309
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:49.080
This job is the next step.

310
00:40:57.622 --> 00:40:59.124
_HGY-
.H6y-

311
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.464
There is a cop upstairs
who wants to talk to you.

312
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:06.347
- I can cover down here if you want.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

313
00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.808
- How's your arm?
- Oh, it's good as new.

314
00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:12.228
Do you want some fries?

315
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:16.020
- Sure. Thanks.
- Here. See you.

316
00:42:02.812 --> 00:42:05.361
You didn't have to come here.
They already have my statement.

317
00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:08.026
Yeah, I know. I was in the area.

318
00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.704
Are you okay? He didn't hurt you?

319
00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:15.579
Just my ego. Did you l.D. him yet?

320
00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:17.460
No, he's not talking.

321
00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:20.337
We'll know more
once we get him to the station.

322
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:24.254
You seem anxious.

323
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:26.594
Are you staying through the night?

324
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:29.631
That's the plan.

325
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.388
I just know how you get
when you're stressed.

326
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:37.306
Okay, look, I appreciate you coming here,
but I've got things covered.

327
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:39.808
Okay?

328
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:43.899
Is there something else?

329
00:42:45.146 --> 00:42:47.695
I know this isn't the right time...

330
00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:53.572
...but when I picked up my stuff,
there was something missing.

331
00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:56.082
A bottle of Xanax.

332
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.794
And you're assuming that I...

333
00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.329
...what, stole them from you?

334
00:43:01.496 --> 00:43:04.625
Did you? It's a valid question.

335
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.839
You're not supposed to be around
controlled medications of any kind.

336
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:09.299
You misplace a bottle of pills
and automatically assume this.

337
00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:11.430
- Why are you getting so defensive?
- I'm not getting defensive.

338
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:14.058
I'm getting pissed. You know...

339
00:43:14.217 --> 00:43:18.438
...it's as if you're completely incapable
of giving me the benefit of the doubt.

340
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:30.325
If you ever need my help,
I'm just a call away. Okay?

341
00:43:32.235 --> 00:43:35.705
Actually, there is something
you can help me with. I'll be right back.

342
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:39.742
H9)'-

343
00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:42.253
- How's it going?
- I'm good. How are you?

344
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.383
I'll just be another minute if that's okay.

345
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:49.670
Yeah, no problem. Take your time.

346
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:02.732
Bases loaded, three-and-two count,
down by three.

347
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.985
The stakes could not be higher.

348
00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:09.023
Here comes the pitch. It's a heater.

349
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:13.902
It's a grand slam!

350
00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:39.560
Can you run these for me at the station?

351
00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:42.188
The scanner broke down
before I could run her prints.

352
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.440
- Her?
- Hannah Grace.

353
00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.171
<i>You already have her ID.</i>

354
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:18.888
I think that l.D. is fake. The picture
on her license doesn't match.

355
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.974
Her eye color, it's different.

356
00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:24.514
- What?
- Once a cop...

357
00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:31.358
Just get me the prints, okay?

358
00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:33.105
You got it.

359
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:22.139
Dave?

360
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:37.447
I mean, seriously.

361
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.834
Dave?

362
00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:04.006
Dave?

363
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.351
Hello?

364
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:01.113
Dave, is that you?

365
00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:17.057
Are you sure
you gave me the right prints?

366
00:50:17.223 --> 00:50:20.067
- Positive.
- The results are odd.

367
00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:21.318
Why do you say that?

368
00:50:21.477 --> 00:50:25.027
<i>Because according to the prints, Hannah
Grace has been dead for three months.</i>

369
00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:28.989
It must be a glitch in the system.
It wouldn't be the first time.

370
00:50:29.902 --> 00:50:31.950
Is everything else okay?

371
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.657
<i>Megan.</i>

372
00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:39.123
Yeah, thanks.

373
00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:35.805
Wait, what?

374
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:23.774
Hey, Dave, where the hell are you, man?

375
00:52:28.937 --> 00:52:30.439
Is everything all right?

376
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:33.818
- The security cameras downstairs...
- Yeah?

377
00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.486
Can I access the morgue footage?

378
00:52:36.445 --> 00:52:38.914
I can't leave the desk unmanned, but...

379
00:52:39.448 --> 00:52:40.791
...here you go.

380
00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:41.871
Thanks.

381
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.717
Oh, my God.

382
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.156
Come on, Megan. Just breathe.

383
00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:08.417
<i>Lab Tech Hernandez,
please dial 1-6-6-7.</i>

384
00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.957
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

385
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:13.342
Yeah. Excuse me.

386
00:54:14.752 --> 00:54:17.801
So, I thought
I saw someone in the bathroom.

387
00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:19.965
When I went to check
the security footage...

388
00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:22.385
...I mean,
I could have sworn it was her.

389
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:24.519
Meg, who is "her"?
What are you talking about?

390
00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.643
I need to show you something.

391
00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.145
There.

392
00:54:29.975 --> 00:54:31.693
What is that?

393
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:33.483
I don't know.

394
00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:38.572
- Well, I mean, it looks like a shadow.
- It's not a shadow.

395
00:54:38.734 --> 00:54:41.203
Look, when that guy broke in...

396
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.955
...he kept talking
about the woman he killed...

397
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:46.867
...Hannah Grace,
how she wasn't really dead.

398
00:54:47.034 --> 00:54:51.084
I looked her up. She died
three months ago during an exorcism.

399
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.760
You know I don't believe
in that kind of stuff, but...

400
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.515
...this, to me, is not a shadow.

401
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:06.558
What is this?

402
00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:15.271
Lisa, I didn't take any.

403
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:18.695
'Are YOU lying to me?
- No. Okay?

404
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:20.700
You need to believe me on this one.

405
00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:24.614
I promise you, I didn't take any.
I wanted to, but I didn't.

406
00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:28.542
I've just had them in my bag
for comfort. I promise.

407
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:31.587
Meg, do you...?

408
00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:34.877
Do you remember
when we were in meetings...

409
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.543
...and they started talking
about coping mechanisms?

410
00:55:37.835 --> 00:55:38.882
Yeah.

411
00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:42.173
An addict's brain tries
to find new ways to cope with stress.

412
00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:44.182
Everything that has happened
to you today...

413
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:45.843
...the stress that it has caused...

414
00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:48.933
...your brain is desperate
to find a way to cope with it.

415
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:52.600
And it is going to do anything it can
to convince you to use again.

416
00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:55.144
My brain did not put a corpse
on the security footage.

417
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.153
Look, I don't know what that thing is...

418
00:55:57.312 --> 00:56:00.441
...but what I do know is you're jumping
to the least plausible explanation.

419
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:03.611
And right now you've got to focus.

420
00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:06.739
So, don't see things that aren't there.

421
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:09.666
- Here.
- No.

422
00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:12.078
- Just take them.
- No.

423
00:56:14.288 --> 00:56:16.256
I trust you.

424
00:56:24.256 --> 00:56:25.348
Okay.

425
00:57:05.631 --> 00:57:06.757
Dave?

426
00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:08.892
Are you okay?

427
00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:09.893
Dave?

428
00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:23.023
Dave?

429
00:59:00.162 --> 00:59:02.005
<i>Intake bay.</i>

430
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:07.424
<i>I brought you a present.</i>

431
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:09.839
- Can you give me a hand again?
- Sorry. I can't help you out.

432
00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:14.226
- Not after last time.
- What? Why? What happened?

433
00:59:14.843 --> 00:59:16.686
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

434
00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:20.315
Okay. Well, try me.

435
00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:24.194
So, it's obviously been a long night...

436
00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:27.606
...and I'm probably
just remembering things wrong.

437
00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:30.113
She had a huge wound...

438
00:59:30.275 --> 00:59:34.530
...going down this side of her abdomen
when you dropped her off. Correct?

439
00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:38.163
Yeah, I could have sworn that she did.

440
00:59:38.325 --> 00:59:40.202
So, where is it now?

441
00:59:40.368 --> 00:59:42.370
And her arm was banged up too, right?

442
00:59:42.537 --> 00:59:44.915
Yeah. Have you checked
the admittance photos?

443
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:49.758
The camera broke down and when I tried
to scan her prints, the scanner died too.

444
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.635
That's weird.

445
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:56.726
So, I had a friend run her prints
at the police station.

446
00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:57.932
And?

447
00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:02.145
Hannah Grace, she died
three months ago during an exorcism.

448
01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:08.068
When that man broke in,
he said she wasn't really dead...

449
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.825
...and now it's almost like
she's healing herself.

450
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:16.705
Can I ask you a personal question?

451
01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:21.288
How personal?

452
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:25.547
Why are you working
the night shift at a morgue?

453
01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:32.342
- Because it's my job.
- No, no. You're smart and resourceful.

454
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.598
So, what happened?

455
01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:39.512
You know what? Actually, it's not even--
I'm sorry. It's not my business.

456
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.271
I had a rough patch
a few years back and...

457
01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:48.312
...I don't know,
I guess I thought I saw that in you.

458
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:52.609
I'm sure that there is
a rational explanation for all of this.

459
01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.526
You just--

460
01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:58.284
Megan, you've got to be careful
that you don't drive yourself crazy here.

461
01:00:58.446 --> 01:00:59.993
I know.

462
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.876
He's adorable.

463
01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:14.012
I used to have a drinking problem.

464
01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.636
And I would get drunk...

465
01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:20.302
...and lie and cheat and...

466
01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.597
...people told me
that I was a dick sometimes.

467
01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.515
All the time.

468
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.355
And then...

469
01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.566
...this guy shows up...

470
01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:33.403
...and he made me want
to be a better person.

471
01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.158
So...

472
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.903
...I quit drinking...

473
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.662
...I quit wing--

474
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:43.788
...and then I was finally able to be honest
with the people that love me...

475
01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.622
...because I was finally able
to be honest with myself.

476
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.265
If you ever want to talk, I'm the guy.

477
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.175
Thank you.

478
01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:04.767
- Have a good night.
- You, too. Get home safe.

479
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.853
<i>Intake bay.</i>

480
01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.165
Hey, I was just about to call you.

481
01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.419
That bottle of Xanax
that you were looking for...

482
01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.079
...I didn't take it.

483
01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.252
Megan, you already told me this.

484
01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:36.136
I found it in the medicine cabinet
after you moved out.

485
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:40.341
And I should have packed it up
with the rest of your things...

486
01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.260
<i>...but I kept it.</i>

487
01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.232
I've just been feeling anxious lately...

488
01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:53.104
...and I felt safer knowing
that they were there.

489
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.739
<i>You know, in case I needed them.</i>

490
01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.695
Why are you telling me this?

491
01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.615
Because I'm tired of lying.

492
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.040
Anyway, I'll drop them off
tomorrow morning if you're there.

493
01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.874
<i>Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm glad you told me, okay?</i>

494
01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:13.711
- Me, too. Bye.
- Bye.

495
01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:23.592
<i>Going down.</i>

496
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.961
This is Randy, drop-off complete.

497
01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:07.491
Goddamn it.

498
01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.796
Hello?

499
01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.474
Hello?

500
01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.459
Randy.

501
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:03.399
Randy?

502
01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.211
Oh, my God.

503
01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.718
Randy.

504
01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:45.402
Andrew.

505
01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.281
<i>Megan, go to security right now.
The guy who broke into the morgue...</i>

506
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.988
<i>...killed the two officers
transporting him to the station.</i>

507
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.778
<i>We have an APB out on him,
but there's a chance he could make--</i>

508
01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.828
- Move.
- Megan?

509
01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.493
<i>Megan?</i>

510
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.083
Open it.

511
01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:12.885
Get the lift.

512
01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:30.865
Do you see
what's happening to her body?

513
01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:32.821
She's healing.

514
01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:37.080
She heals herself by killing people
and then she rests.

515
01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.999
Why hasn't she killed you?

516
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.040
I don't know.

517
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.293
I believe you.

518
01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:07.360
There's something evil hiding inside her.

519
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.813
The church...

520
01:09:10.355 --> 01:09:11.447
...said to walk away...

521
01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.702
...but I couldn't give up on my only child.

522
01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.742
That's your daughter?

523
01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.497
Not anymore.

524
01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.244
Hannah struggled with depression...

525
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.003
...anxiety.

526
01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.923
It worked on her...

527
01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.585
...day after day...

528
01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:34.546
...till it broke her...

529
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.183
...found its way inside her body.

530
01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.093
Is that when her eye changed?

531
01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.095
Yeah.

532
01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.897
That's the demon's mark.

533
01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:50.312
No matter how many exorcisms
they performed, it stayed.

534
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.402
One last...

535
01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:55.946
...attempt.

536
01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.825
In the name of God,
in the name of Jesus Christ...

537
01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:01.660
...our Lord, be gone!

538
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.959
You have to understand...

539
01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.917
...I did what I did...

540
01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.916
...to save the lives of others.

541
01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:21.847
But the demon was too powerful.

542
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.638
<i>It stayed.</i>

543
01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.892
The next day,
when we went to bury her...

544
01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:33.113
...her body, it disappeared
from the mortuary.

545
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.953
<i>Four people were dead.</i>

546
01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:46.371
We have to get her to the incinerator.

547
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.963
The knife wasn't enough.

548
01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:54.046
The only way to destroy this thing
is to burn her.

549
01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.508
Anything else just slows her down.

550
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.281
No!

551
01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:28.956
Come and get me!

552
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.298
No! Stop!

553
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.425
No!

554
01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.211
Stop!

555
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.848
No!

556
01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.448
Come on. Come on.

557
01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:01.405
Come on.

558
01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.031
Come on.

559
01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.241
Come on!

560
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.091
<i>Mezzanine.</i>

561
01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:22.301
No.

562
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.223
<i>Going UP-</i>

563
01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:37.270
<i>Arrived at mezzanine.</i>

564
01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:11.346
Officer Kurtz, reporting a 10-65.

565
01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:15.608
I need backup at Boston Metro Hospital,
possible homicide.

566
01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:08.861
<i>Arrived at morgue.</i>

567
01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:13.207
Megan?

568
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.907
Megan?

569
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.125
Megan?

570
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:33.992
Oh, my God.

571
01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.748
Oh, my God.

572
01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.334
Oh, God.

573
01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:45.466
Oh, God.

574
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.892
Fuck.

575
01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:58.305
- Who's there?
- It's Officer Kurtz.

576
01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:03.234
- Megan's friend. Where is she?
- Yeah, I don't know.

577
01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.985
Dave's missing, too.

578
01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.988
Everything's down.
What's going on down here?

579
01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.955
Oh, God.

580
01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:34.511
- Megan.
- Andrew. Oh, my God.

581
01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.142
- What happened?
- We have to get out of here.

582
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.269
What the hell is that?

583
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:45.893
Come on.

584
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:50.156
- What?
- Oh, my God. Come on! Come on!

585
01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:53.150
Hey!

586
01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:54.739
<i>Going down.</i>

587
01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:55.949
Megan!

588
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.703
Hey, stop!

589
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.836
Hannah,no.

590
01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:18.513
No!

591
01:17:18.676 --> 01:17:20.019
Let him go!

592
01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:24.515
Megan.

593
01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.279
Megan.

594
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.353
Andrew. Are you okay?

595
01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.818
Okay, come on. Hurry.
We don't have much time.

596
01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:38.890
- Go get help.
- Wait. What? Megan.

597
01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:22.099
No! Help me, please!

598
01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:03.576
<i>I'm 62 days clean...</i>

599
01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:10.624
<i>...and I'm thankful for how far I've come.</i>

600
01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.502
<i>It's not easy.</i>

601
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:23.429
<i>And I know I have a long way to go...</i>

602
01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:27.308
<i>...but I'm feeling stronger every day.</i>

603
01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:40.609
<i>Nothing's going to stop me now.</i>
