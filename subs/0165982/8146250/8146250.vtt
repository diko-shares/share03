1
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.370
Wake up, my beauties.

2
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.499
Rise and shine.

3
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.709
It's a brand-new day,
and the mortal world

4
00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.647
is at peace.

5
00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:00.178
But not for long.

6
00:01:00.218 --> 00:01:04.317
Just look at them.

7
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.286
I pull one tiny thread,

8
00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:09.776
and their whole world unravels
into chaos.

9
00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:13.815
Glorious chaos.

10
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:19.453
And what could be more
perfect than this?

11
00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:21.432
A noble prince,

12
00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:23.433
a priceless treasure,

13
00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:27.162
and a black-hearted thief.

14
00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:30.870
Oh, this is going to be fun.

15
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.170
- Cetus?

16
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.239
You know what to do.

17
00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:38.309
Let the games begin.

18
00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:53.555
Gentlemen, this is
what we've been waiting for.

19
00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:55.956
The world's most valuable object

20
00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.964
is on its way to Syracuse.

21
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.394
It's a shame
it'll never get there.

22
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.023
After today, we retire to Fiji.

23
00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:08.593
- Fiji!
- Fiji!

24
00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:11.062
Kale!

25
00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:12.131
Aye, Captain.

26
00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:14.641
- Spike!

27
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.871
Let's get rich!

28
00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:55.203
Did you catch
that last move?

29
00:02:55.243 --> 00:02:57.042
Pretty cool, huh?

30
00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:58.541
I thought you
overworked it.

31
00:02:58.581 --> 00:02:59.742
Just a bit.

32
00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:01.511
Aw, y...

33
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.740
Overworked it?

34
00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.449
Oh, and I was overworking it?

35
00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.118
Proteus.

36
00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:16.317
Whoa.

37
00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:18.288
This just got interesting.

38
00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:20.017
How long has it been?

39
00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:21.886
About a lifetime ago.

40
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.765
You still fight
like an old lady.

41
00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:30.794
Sinbad?

42
00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:32.535
- Oh. Ooh.

43
00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:33.834
Sinbad.

44
00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:35.963
What...?
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:37.704
I'm working.

46
00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:39.832
You?

47
00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.073
What happened to you?

48
00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:42.303
Where have you been?

49
00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:44.371
Hey, love to stop and catch up,

50
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.071
but I've got things to do,
places to go, stuff to steal.

51
00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.359
Oh... yeah.

52
00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.157
Sinbad,
we need to talk.

53
00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:06.167
Heard about it,
read about it,

54
00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.726
never actually seen it.

55
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.795
The Book of Peace.

56
00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:18.935
It's my job to bring it
safely to Syracuse.

57
00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.303
Really? Now, see, now,
I- I just feel bad,

58
00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.434
because you're going
to get fired.

59
00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:24.963
You can't be serious.

60
00:04:25.013 --> 00:04:27.573
You disappear for ten years,
show up, and rob me?

61
00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:28.742
I wish it wasn't you.

62
00:04:28.782 --> 00:04:29.872
I do.

63
00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:30.941
Really.

64
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:33.751
- But...
- But it is me, Sinbad.

65
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:37.281
Proteus, we had a special
handshake, some code words,

66
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.520
a secret hideout.

67
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.390
It was fun, big fun,
but, uh, we were kids.

68
00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:43.719
We were friends!

69
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.348
You're not going
to steal this.

70
00:04:45.398 --> 00:04:46.949
Not from me.

71
00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.327
And what would you
do with it anyway?

72
00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:52.197
The Book of Peace protects
all of us in the Twelve Cities.

73
00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:53.197
Exactly.

74
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:54.857
So, just imagine
how much all of us

75
00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.067
will pay to get it back.

76
00:04:56.107 --> 00:04:57.296
Let me say it again.

77
00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:59.606
A long time ago,
you and I were friends.

78
00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:03.594
If that ever meant anything
to you, prove it now.

79
00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:05.045
You're right.

80
00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:07.803
That was a long time ago.

81
00:05:14.453 --> 00:05:17.211
Come on.
Don't get all heroic, Proteus.

82
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.820
If you want the Book,
you have to go through me.

83
00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:35.487
What the...?

84
00:05:39.337 --> 00:05:41.397
Dear gods.

85
00:05:57.883 --> 00:06:00.753
Go, Spike.

86
00:06:05.621 --> 00:06:07.890
- I gotcha! I gotcha!

87
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.891
Well, I see you're busy.

88
00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:12.449
So, uh, stay in touch.

89
00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:13.620
Wait! Wait!

90
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.129
You're just going
to run away?

91
00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.128
Uh, yeah.

92
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:20.528
Wh-whoa!

93
00:06:26.336 --> 00:06:27.967
Sinbad!

94
00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:30.275
You! My...!

95
00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:31.575
My ship!

96
00:06:45.152 --> 00:06:46.483
Heads up!

97
00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:59.089
Now...
stand by for sushi.

98
00:07:13.577 --> 00:07:15.636
Give that guy a raise.

99
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:19.775
Come on!
Come on, Sinbad!

100
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:20.875
Let's go!

101
00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:21.974
Wait.
Stand your ground.

102
00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:23.315
- W-What are you doing?

103
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:24.544
Hey!

104
00:07:24.584 --> 00:07:25.554
Hey, hey!

105
00:07:25.584 --> 00:07:27.714
Lobster Boy, over here!

106
00:07:33.822 --> 00:07:35.021
Run!

107
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.692
Fall back!

108
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.131
Grab hold!

109
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.229
Let's go!

110
00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.498
Come on!

111
00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:53.737
And the plan?

112
00:07:53.777 --> 00:07:56.038
How about try not to get killed?

113
00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:57.667
Hold on!

114
00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:01.236
Here, you'll need this.

115
00:08:01.276 --> 00:08:03.145
Where are you going?

116
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:04.346
Fishing!

117
00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.724
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

118
00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:32.030
Now!

119
00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:39.867
Whoo!

120
00:08:40.977 --> 00:08:42.178
Woo-hoo!

121
00:08:46.447 --> 00:08:48.046
- Oh...
- You okay?

122
00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:49.015
Yeah.

123
00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:50.986
Thanks for sticking around.

124
00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:53.514
Ah, just like old times.

125
00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:55.655
Look out!

126
00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:57.554
- Sinbad!

127
00:09:29.947 --> 00:09:33.506
The day began with such promise.

128
00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:36.616
And now look.

129
00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:38.415
My sea monster is dead,

130
00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:41.825
and I still don't have
the Book of Peace.

131
00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.293
All because of you, Sinbad.

132
00:09:44.323 --> 00:09:46.354
Uh-huh.

133
00:09:46.394 --> 00:09:48.023
And you are?

134
00:09:48.063 --> 00:09:51.033
Eris, the Goddess of Discord.

135
00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:52.332
No doubt you've seen
my likeness

136
00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:55.162
on the temple walls.

137
00:09:56.372 --> 00:09:58.600
You know,
they don't do you justice.

138
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.611
Uh-huh. Now...

139
00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:02.370
about my sea monster.

140
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.879
Right, right.

141
00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:05.640
Listen, I'm sorry
about that.

142
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.578
I don't suppose a heartfelt
apology would do.

143
00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:11.908
Heartfelt? From you?

144
00:10:11.948 --> 00:10:15.147
Sinbad, you don't have a heart.

145
00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:20.286
That's what I like about you.

146
00:10:20.326 --> 00:10:23.556
So, I'm going
to let you live.

147
00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:26.254
But there's
just one little thing

148
00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:27.885
you have to do.

149
00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:31.293
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

150
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.354
Right. Hmm.

151
00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:33.623
Now, see, that's
a problem for me

152
00:10:33.663 --> 00:10:35.462
because I had
my own plans for it.

153
00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:36.472
Uh, ransom, get rich.

154
00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:37.473
You know, "me" stuff.

155
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:42.302
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

156
00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:43.741
Steal the Book for ransom,

157
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.240
and you'll be
rich enough

158
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.041
to lounge
on an island beach.

159
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:51.480
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

160
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.108
and the island and the world.

161
00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:56.209
Hmm.

162
00:10:56.249 --> 00:10:58.217
You let me live,
you make me rich,

163
00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.418
I retire to paradise.

164
00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:03.256
So far, I don't see a downside.

165
00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:05.227
If you keep your word.

166
00:11:05.257 --> 00:11:08.195
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

167
00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:10.496
she's bound for all eternity.

168
00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:12.464
All right, you're on.

169
00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:14.595
I knew you'd
see it my way.

170
00:11:14.635 --> 00:11:18.224
So, when you've
stolen the Book,

171
00:11:18.274 --> 00:11:21.722
follow that star
beyond the horizon.

172
00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:23.363
You'll find yourself

173
00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:27.171
in Tartarus,
my Realm of Chaos.

174
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:28.372
Tartarus.

175
00:11:28.412 --> 00:11:30.041
I'll see you there.

176
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:31.670
It's a date then.

177
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.239
So, where were we?

178
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.840
Oh, yes.

179
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.078
You were holding your breath.

180
00:11:47.557 --> 00:11:49.646
He's so cute.

181
00:11:49.696 --> 00:11:52.856
And so gullible.

182
00:11:52.896 --> 00:11:55.796
Cetus, well done.

183
00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:07.133
- Sinbad, you're alive!

184
00:12:07.173 --> 00:12:08.932
Glad you made it.

185
00:12:08.972 --> 00:12:10.672
Pay up.
He lived.

186
00:12:11.942 --> 00:12:13.141
What happened down there?

187
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.372
You wouldn't...

188
00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:15.541
believe me if I told you.

189
00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:16.910
Try me.

190
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.711
All right, here goes.

191
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:21.549
So I meet Eris,
the Goddess of Chaos.

192
00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:23.140
She's got
a major crush on me,

193
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.149
and she invited me
back to her place.

194
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.549
Ha! That's a good one!

195
00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:30.358
- Goddess of Chaos?

196
00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:31.857
Oh, I'm writing that down.

197
00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:33.827
So, that's it then?
No Book.

198
00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:35.386
Now what do we do?

199
00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:36.726
A little patience, Rat.

200
00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:38.526
It's not like we don't know
where it's going.

201
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:43.695
Men, all sails to Syracuse!

202
00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:45.604
Right away, sir!

203
00:13:25.506 --> 00:13:27.265
For as long
as I can remember,

204
00:13:27.305 --> 00:13:28.996
I've dreamed of this moment.

205
00:13:29.036 --> 00:13:31.094
The sacred treasure

206
00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.695
that's protected us
for a thousand years

207
00:13:33.744 --> 00:13:35.833
is now in Syracuse.

208
00:13:35.873 --> 00:13:37.604
- A toast!
- To Dymas!

209
00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:38.373
Hear, hear!

210
00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:39.743
To the Book of Peace!

211
00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:42.043
And to you, King Dymas
and Prince Proteus.

212
00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:45.141
- Make way!

213
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:49.150
You see?

214
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.711
This is what happens
when you use the front entrance.

215
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.020
Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.609
What is he doing here?

217
00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:57.019
At least he's not out
robbing someone.

218
00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:00.219
That's because everyone
worth robbing is here.

219
00:14:03.197 --> 00:14:04.257
I'll bet you ten crowns

220
00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.097
you're about to put
those swords down.

221
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.597
I'll take that bet.

222
00:14:07.636 --> 00:14:08.626
Guards...

223
00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:10.197
put away your swords.

224
00:14:10.237 --> 00:14:12.435
I don't see you for ten years,

225
00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:15.166
and now twice in one day...

226
00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:16.605
You're smothering me.

227
00:14:17.974 --> 00:14:21.274
I knew you'd want to thank me
for saving your life... again.

228
00:14:22.713 --> 00:14:25.473
You probably just heard
we had free food and wine.

229
00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:26.482
You hear that, guys?

230
00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:28.743
Dinner and drinks
are on the prince.

231
00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:29.942
Come on.

232
00:14:29.982 --> 00:14:31.681
There's someone
I want you to meet.

233
00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:34.211
Get to work.

234
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.510
Weapons?

235
00:14:49.737 --> 00:14:50.758
Here she is.

236
00:14:50.798 --> 00:14:52.068
I've told her
all about you.

237
00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:56.337
Sinbad, I would
like to introduce you

238
00:14:56.377 --> 00:14:57.666
to my fiancee,

239
00:14:57.706 --> 00:15:00.306
the Lady Marina,
Ambassador from Thrace.

240
00:15:04.444 --> 00:15:07.144
So, this is the infamous Sinbad.

241
00:15:07.184 --> 00:15:09.203
I heard all about this morning.

242
00:15:09.254 --> 00:15:13.152
First you tried to rob Proteus,
and then you save his life.

243
00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:15.343
So, which are you...

244
00:15:15.392 --> 00:15:17.681
a thief or a hero?

245
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.812
Sinbad wanted

246
00:15:19.862 --> 00:15:21.950
to give me an opportunity
to thank...

247
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.930
...him.

248
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.458
Eight months on the sea

249
00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:34.028
with nothing but eggs
and pickles...

250
00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:36.827
you don't know what
that can do to a man.

251
00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:39.337
Oh, it's almost too easy.

252
00:15:39.377 --> 00:15:41.366
There's only
a handful of guards.

253
00:15:41.406 --> 00:15:42.377
Forget it.

254
00:15:42.407 --> 00:15:43.666
Let's get back to the ship.

255
00:15:43.706 --> 00:15:44.835
Just like that?

256
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:46.746
But the Book is almost ours.

257
00:15:50.114 --> 00:15:51.085
Oh.

258
00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:52.844
Wh-What?
Who is she?

259
00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:54.403
An old girlfriend?

260
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.284
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

261
00:15:56.324 --> 00:15:58.153
Let's go.

262
00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:00.653
Jed, pack it up.

263
00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:02.952
What? I-I... I just put the...

264
00:16:10.531 --> 00:16:14.160
Oh, this is just too easy.

265
00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:17.198
Look at it this way:

266
00:16:17.238 --> 00:16:18.398
Now that Sinbad's gone,

267
00:16:18.438 --> 00:16:20.838
your father can finally relax
and enjoy the evening.

268
00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:23.498
Well, you're right about that.

269
00:16:23.538 --> 00:16:24.907
He's trying not to show it,

270
00:16:24.937 --> 00:16:28.877
but he's so proud
to have the Book in Syracuse.

271
00:16:28.917 --> 00:16:32.275
He's been planning this day
his whole life.

272
00:16:32.315 --> 00:16:35.974
And soon it will be
your responsibility.

273
00:16:36.014 --> 00:16:38.075
Our responsibility.

274
00:16:43.953 --> 00:16:45.512
It's beautiful.

275
00:16:45.562 --> 00:16:46.753
It is.

276
00:16:46.793 --> 00:16:49.521
My father spent years
preparing it for the Book.

277
00:16:49.561 --> 00:16:51.292
There are guards
on every level,

278
00:16:51.332 --> 00:16:52.951
and if you look
up to the...

279
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.931
Ah...

280
00:16:56.971 --> 00:16:59.399
You were talking about
the ocean, weren't you?

281
00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:03.668
I only wish I'd
seen more of it.

282
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:08.227
I used to imagine sailing
far beyond the Twelve Cities,

283
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.938
discovering the world.

284
00:17:12.077 --> 00:17:13.776
Oh, look at it, Proteus.

285
00:17:13.816 --> 00:17:16.576
There's so much wonder.

286
00:17:16.616 --> 00:17:18.085
Marina...

287
00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:23.945
Our marriage was arranged
many years ago.

288
00:17:23.985 --> 00:17:26.084
It's always been expected of us.

289
00:17:26.124 --> 00:17:29.493
But politics is not a reason
to get married.

290
00:17:29.523 --> 00:17:31.492
Uh, and I don't want you
to do this

291
00:17:31.522 --> 00:17:33.153
just because it's your duty.

292
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:37.892
I'm asking you
for myself now.

293
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.561
Marina...

294
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.161
will you marry me?

295
00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:45.229
Proteus, I...

296
00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:46.600
There you are!

297
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.800
I think the delegates
from Manoli

298
00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:48.929
are trying to give a toast.

299
00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:50.338
Although, I'm not sure.

300
00:17:50.378 --> 00:17:52.668
They're doing something
with their knees.

301
00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:54.297
Marina, I need
an ambassador.

302
00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.206
Of course, Sire.

303
00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:17.992
- Huh?

304
00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:47.986
- Who's there?

305
00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:00.894
Huh?

306
00:19:02.633 --> 00:19:03.992
Sinbad!

307
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:13.930
I love playing pretend.

308
00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:25.378
All the pieces
are coming together.

309
00:19:28.148 --> 00:19:30.877
Proteus, the Book!

310
00:19:56.772 --> 00:19:58.211
Sinbad.

311
00:19:58.241 --> 00:19:59.470
Proteus!

312
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.311
It's about time.

313
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:03.369
Do you realize
how serious this is?

314
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:04.639
Do you realize

315
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:06.509
how many times
I've heard that today?

316
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:07.479
You've betrayed Syracuse!

317
00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:09.679
Oh... not you, too.

318
00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:10.779
Stealing the Book of Peace,

319
00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:12.408
when you knew how much
it meant to us!

320
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.358
Proteus, here's
the way this works.

321
00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:16.117
First, I actually
commit a crime,

322
00:20:16.157 --> 00:20:18.146
and then you get
to blame me for it!

323
00:20:18.186 --> 00:20:21.156
Then how do
you explain this?

324
00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:25.015
Eris.

325
00:20:25.065 --> 00:20:25.895
What?

326
00:20:25.935 --> 00:20:28.225
Eris... she framed me.

327
00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:30.134
- Sinbad, listen to yourself.
- Trust me, Proteus,

328
00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.603
the Book is in Tartarus.

329
00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:34.533
Talk to your father.
Tell him I'm...

330
00:20:34.573 --> 00:20:35.862
This is beyond my father.

331
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.433
The ambassadors are convening
now for your trial.

332
00:20:38.473 --> 00:20:39.802
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:20:39.842 --> 00:20:40.901
Trial? I didn't do it!

334
00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:42.532
Look, I left the Book
on your ship,

335
00:20:42.582 --> 00:20:44.071
and that's the
last I saw of it.

336
00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:45.200
You were there.

337
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.141
You know the truth.

338
00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:48.240
You know me.

339
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.809
Do I?

340
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:51.940
I knew a kid.

341
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.748
Who are you now, Sinbad?

342
00:20:56.419 --> 00:21:00.378
Look me in the eye
and tell me.

343
00:21:00.428 --> 00:21:02.517
Did you steal the Book?

344
00:21:04.456 --> 00:21:06.626
No.

345
00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.795
We've heard enough of your lies.

346
00:21:11.835 --> 00:21:12.854
Sinbad,

347
00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.365
for the last time,
give us the Book.

348
00:21:15.405 --> 00:21:18.333
How many times
do I have to say it?

349
00:21:18.373 --> 00:21:19.734
I don't have it!

350
00:21:19.774 --> 00:21:21.073
Very well, then.

351
00:21:21.103 --> 00:21:22.502
The Delegation

352
00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:25.302
of the Twelve Cities finds you
guilty of treason,

353
00:21:25.342 --> 00:21:26.901
and we sentence you to die.

354
00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:27.911
Take him away.

355
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:29.412
Come on!
This is a joke, right?

356
00:21:29.452 --> 00:21:31.280
Are you...
are you people blind?

357
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.280
I didn't do it!

358
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.411
Stop!

359
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.420
I demand the right
of substitution.

360
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.279
Take me in his place.

361
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:40.249
No!

362
00:21:41.018 --> 00:21:42.289
Sinbad says

363
00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:44.378
that Eris took the Book...

364
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.947
and I believe him.

365
00:21:45.997 --> 00:21:47.988
Let him go to Tartarus
and recover the Book.

366
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:48.997
What?

367
00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:51.357
What are you doing?

368
00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:53.336
You claim that Eris
stole the Book...

369
00:21:53.366 --> 00:21:54.355
steal it back.

370
00:21:54.395 --> 00:21:55.735
You're good at that.

371
00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:58.135
Hey, look, I will not be
responsible for your life.

372
00:21:58.165 --> 00:21:59.394
You would do
the same for me.

373
00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:00.665
No, I wouldn't.

374
00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:02.574
If Sinbad is allowed to leave

375
00:22:02.604 --> 00:22:05.134
the city, he'll
never come back!

376
00:22:05.174 --> 00:22:07.003
Son, listen to reason.

377
00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:09.673
No, Father, you listen.

378
00:22:09.713 --> 00:22:13.301
Sinbad either stole the Book,
or he's telling the truth

379
00:22:13.351 --> 00:22:14.712
and it's in Tartarus.

380
00:22:14.752 --> 00:22:17.311
Either way,
he's our only hope.

381
00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:18.941
But you can't...

382
00:22:18.991 --> 00:22:23.289
Proteus, you realize that
if Sinbad does not return,

383
00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:26.449
you will be put to death
in his place.

384
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:30.288
I understand.

385
00:22:31.557 --> 00:22:32.828
So be it.

386
00:22:32.868 --> 00:22:34.657
Sinbad has ten days

387
00:22:34.697 --> 00:22:36.756
to return the Book.

388
00:22:38.837 --> 00:22:39.926
Release him.

389
00:23:00.682 --> 00:23:02.551
Oh, and, Sinbad...

390
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.091
don't be late.

391
00:23:37.213 --> 00:23:39.643
Hmm.

392
00:23:44.682 --> 00:23:45.841
So, any idea

393
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.682
how we actually
get to Tartarus?

394
00:23:47.722 --> 00:23:48.741
Tartarus?

395
00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:49.950
Oh, no, no, no, no.

396
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.051
People get killed in Tartarus.

397
00:23:52.091 --> 00:23:54.030
So where are we going?

398
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.020
Fiji.

399
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.088
Fiji? This time of year?

400
00:24:00.128 --> 00:24:01.459
Think of the beaches.

401
00:24:01.499 --> 00:24:04.097
Oh, beautiful,
if you like mosquitoes.

402
00:24:04.197 --> 00:24:05.188
Think of the sun.

403
00:24:05.238 --> 00:24:07.097
It's monsoon season.

404
00:24:07.137 --> 00:24:08.966
Oh, then the women.

405
00:24:09.006 --> 00:24:10.367
They're cannibals, Sinbad.

406
00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:12.466
Exactly.

407
00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:14.906
Come on, Kale.

408
00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:16.435
He's your friend.

409
00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:18.914
Listen to you.
You sound like my mother.

410
00:24:18.944 --> 00:24:20.245
Proteus will be fine.

411
00:24:20.285 --> 00:24:21.504
You're sure of that?

412
00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:22.743
You and I both know

413
00:24:22.783 --> 00:24:24.844
Dymas is not going to let them
execute his only son.

414
00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:26.113
So we're running away?

415
00:24:26.153 --> 00:24:27.482
We're retiring.

416
00:24:27.522 --> 00:24:29.783
We don't need another score.
We've got enough.

417
00:24:29.822 --> 00:24:32.341
Now, set a course for Fiji.

418
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:35.651
Gentlemen,
we're heading to Fiji!

419
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:37.320
- Fiji! Fiji!

420
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:42.360
Kale... Book.

421
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.759
Proteus.

422
00:24:46.138 --> 00:24:48.189
Look at all this.

423
00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:51.398
I can't believe it.

424
00:24:51.438 --> 00:24:53.427
Oh, but this can't be real.

425
00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:54.806
It'd be far too deli...

426
00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:56.437
- Uh-oh.

427
00:24:59.245 --> 00:25:01.476
This is more like it.

428
00:25:01.516 --> 00:25:03.005
Stolen from Venezia.

429
00:25:04.514 --> 00:25:05.985
From Pompeii...

430
00:25:06.015 --> 00:25:09.143
And from a brothel
in Syracuse.

431
00:25:09.253 --> 00:25:10.414
Good guess.

432
00:25:11.883 --> 00:25:13.282
What do you think
you're doing here?

433
00:25:13.322 --> 00:25:15.723
I'm here to make sure you
get the Book of Peace.

434
00:25:15.763 --> 00:25:17.851
Or bring back your
dead body if you fail.

435
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:19.152
Really?

436
00:25:19.192 --> 00:25:20.721
And how are you going
to pull that off?

437
00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:22.280
By whatever means necessary.

438
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.690
Did you bring a crew?

439
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:24.891
No.

440
00:25:24.931 --> 00:25:26.020
You know how to
get to Tartarus?

441
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.029
Um... no.

442
00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:28.059
Can you navigate
on your own?

443
00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:28.730
Yes!

444
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.099
Well, good!

445
00:25:30.139 --> 00:25:31.868
Then I'll dump your butt
in a rowboat,

446
00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:34.169
and you can paddle
all the way back to Syracuse.

447
00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:37.067
'Cause we're going to Fiji.

448
00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:39.707
Fiji?

449
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:40.766
Yup.

450
00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:43.806
Just as I thought.

451
00:25:43.846 --> 00:25:45.176
What?

452
00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:46.335
Sinbad,

453
00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:49.375
you're not
a very complicated guy.

454
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.474
All someone has to do

455
00:25:50.514 --> 00:25:52.615
is imagine the most
gutless course of action,

456
00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.014
and you're bound to take it.

457
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:56.384
Hey, this is not my problem.

458
00:25:56.424 --> 00:25:58.513
I did not steal the Book.

459
00:25:58.553 --> 00:26:01.853
You're really not going to lose
any sleep over this, are you?

460
00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:02.862
Not a wink.

461
00:26:02.892 --> 00:26:05.191
Because me,
I'd be tossing and turning,

462
00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:09.360
knowing I'm alive...
because I let my friend die.

463
00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:12.460
I'm not responsible
for this mess.

464
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.589
And I didn't ask Proteus

465
00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:14.860
to put his neck
on the line for me.

466
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.138
Look, clearly I can't
appeal to your honor.

467
00:26:18.168 --> 00:26:21.038
But I have other ways
of convincing you.

468
00:26:21.078 --> 00:26:22.907
Really?

469
00:26:22.947 --> 00:26:25.877
Uh... just how do you
expect to do that?

470
00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:28.006
By speaking your language.

471
00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:31.805
Keep talking.

472
00:26:39.194 --> 00:26:40.654
Yup, this'll do!

473
00:26:40.694 --> 00:26:43.484
But not for first class.

474
00:26:44.923 --> 00:26:47.863
As you can see, we're
well equipped to accommodate

475
00:26:47.893 --> 00:26:50.451
the most discerning
of royal tastes.

476
00:26:50.501 --> 00:26:52.902
We have excellent ocean views...

477
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.101
...luxurious living quarters,

478
00:26:57.141 --> 00:26:59.229
with three
gourmet meals a day...

479
00:26:59.339 --> 00:27:02.359
pickles, eggs, and pickles.

480
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.768
Oh, hey, Spike,
there you are.

481
00:27:04.808 --> 00:27:06.179
I'd like to introduce you

482
00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:07.238
to your new bunkmate...
well, actually,

483
00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:08.637
you're his new bunkmate,

484
00:27:08.677 --> 00:27:10.238
as it's actually his bunk.

485
00:27:12.417 --> 00:27:13.406
We do hope

486
00:27:13.446 --> 00:27:15.847
you have a pleasant stay
aboard the Chimera.

487
00:27:15.887 --> 00:27:18.075
Oh, if he starts
hugging your leg,

488
00:27:18.115 --> 00:27:19.676
it means he likes you.

489
00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:22.125
If you think...

490
00:27:25.095 --> 00:27:28.223
How did she even get
on the ship?

491
00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:36.791
Gentlemen, we have a new course.

492
00:27:36.831 --> 00:27:38.032
We're going to Tartarus.

493
00:27:38.072 --> 00:27:39.801
Huh? What
happened to Fiji?

494
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:40.820
What? No fun?

495
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.860
No beaches?

496
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.701
Rat.

497
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:45.260
Sorry, Captain.

498
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.570
But did you
say Tartarus?

499
00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:48.579
That's right.

500
00:27:48.609 --> 00:27:50.408
Will that be
the same Tartarus

501
00:27:50.448 --> 00:27:52.509
from which no sailor
ever returns?

502
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:54.478
The Tartarus
of lost souls,

503
00:27:54.518 --> 00:27:55.777
where they
grind your bones

504
00:27:55.817 --> 00:27:57.248
and pickle your
spleen, and...

505
00:27:57.288 --> 00:27:58.977
No, Rat.
This is the nice Tartarus,

506
00:27:59.017 --> 00:28:00.506
with lots of beaches and drinks.

507
00:28:00.556 --> 00:28:02.786
You know,
with little umbrellas?

508
00:28:02.826 --> 00:28:05.486
<i>Non ci posso credere,</i>

509
00:28:05.526 --> 00:28:09.014
<i>non ci posso credere,
mi hanno fregato ancora.</i>

510
00:28:09.064 --> 00:28:13.123
I'm only doing this
for the money.

511
00:28:13.163 --> 00:28:14.924
Right.

512
00:28:14.964 --> 00:28:16.723
So how do we get there?

513
00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:20.033
That star's our point.

514
00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:37.308
Wow.

515
00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:39.648
Our little thief
isn't going to run away.

516
00:28:40.788 --> 00:28:43.478
He thinks he's going to pay us
a visit.

517
00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:48.986
Hmm. Let's provide
some mood music.

518
00:29:02.903 --> 00:29:05.332
Oh, come on. You look great.

519
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.340
Look lively!
Jed, get the long poles!

520
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.039
Oh, pardon me, milady.

521
00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:19.640
Hey, we need
a pole over here.

522
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.740
Jin, one over here.

523
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.478
Yeah, come on, come on, come on.

524
00:29:27.987 --> 00:29:29.888
The Dragon's Teeth?

525
00:29:34.157 --> 00:29:35.686
Indeed, signorina.

526
00:29:35.726 --> 00:29:37.315
Only the most
foolish of captains

527
00:29:37.365 --> 00:29:39.326
would dare to sail
a ship through this!

528
00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:41.164
Rat, reef the fores'le.

529
00:29:41.194 --> 00:29:43.994
Oh, ex-excuse me, signorina.

530
00:29:47.734 --> 00:29:48.763
Are you sure
you know what...?

531
00:29:48.803 --> 00:29:50.292
Yes, we've done this
kind of thing before.

532
00:29:50.342 --> 00:29:51.673
- No, there is no other way.
- Look...

533
00:29:51.703 --> 00:29:52.803
- And, yes,
- But...

534
00:29:52.843 --> 00:29:55.141
you have my permission
to stand there quietly

535
00:29:55.171 --> 00:29:56.842
and get a free lesson
in sailing.

536
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:57.841
You know...

537
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:59.370
Besides, a ship is
no place for a woman.

538
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.381
Jin!

539
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:02.381
Easy on the main!

540
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.380
Aye!

541
00:30:29.635 --> 00:30:31.733
Steady as she goes.

542
00:30:33.474 --> 00:30:35.533
Rocks off the starboard bow!

543
00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:58.688
Steady.

544
00:31:10.206 --> 00:31:11.865
What is that sound?

545
00:31:11.905 --> 00:31:13.494
Shh.

546
00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:24.543
Sinbad, I...

547
00:31:26.212 --> 00:31:28.311
Sirens.

548
00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:42.949
Sinbad.

549
00:31:47.027 --> 00:31:49.227
Sinbad!

550
00:31:49.267 --> 00:31:50.237
Jin?

551
00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:52.857
- Li?

552
00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:55.195
Come and get it, ladies!

553
00:31:55.235 --> 00:31:56.566
Kale?

554
00:31:56.606 --> 00:31:57.936
Come with me.

555
00:31:57.975 --> 00:32:00.064
We'll speak of love.

556
00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:02.205
Oh...

557
00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:04.143
Who's bad?

558
00:32:04.173 --> 00:32:05.704
Sin-bad.

559
00:32:05.744 --> 00:32:07.803
Ah... men.

560
00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:25.650
I saw her first!

561
00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:31.458
Round the deck! Now!

562
00:32:33.167 --> 00:32:33.998
Yeah...

563
00:32:35.937 --> 00:32:37.236
Amore!

564
00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:38.927
Amore! Amore!

565
00:32:38.967 --> 00:32:39.936
My darling.

566
00:32:39.976 --> 00:32:40.836
Rat!

567
00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:41.865
I love you.

568
00:32:45.874 --> 00:32:47.775
Il mare e le onde andiamo via.

569
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.391
Spike!

570
00:33:06.431 --> 00:33:07.390
Get Sinbad!

571
00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:10.089
Ow!

572
00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:47.091
Spike, the blades!

573
00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:37.020
Oh, my precious.

574
00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.551
Wake up, you idiot!

575
00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.160
What happened?

576
00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.599
Sinbad saved us.

577
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:44.859
No, Marina.

578
00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.428
Marina saved us? Marina!

579
00:34:46.468 --> 00:34:47.599
Marina saved us.

580
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.068
All right, men, snap out of it.

581
00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:51.467
Let's get back to reality.

582
00:34:51.507 --> 00:34:52.698
We got a ship to sail.

583
00:34:52.748 --> 00:34:54.607
Here's my little hero.

584
00:34:54.677 --> 00:34:56.146
You were so brave.

585
00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:58.506
Yeah. What a good dog.

586
00:34:58.546 --> 00:35:01.816
Uh...

587
00:35:01.846 --> 00:35:03.975
Still think a ship's
no place for a woman?

588
00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:07.914
Absolutely!

589
00:35:09.393 --> 00:35:10.944
I mean, look at my ship!

590
00:35:10.994 --> 00:35:13.483
This railing was
hand-carved mahogany!

591
00:35:13.523 --> 00:35:14.612
And here!

592
00:35:14.662 --> 00:35:16.992
These moldings came
all the way from Damascus!

593
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.221
Do you have any idea

594
00:35:18.261 --> 00:35:20.392
what I went through
to steal these?

595
00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:25.161
That's exactly
why women shouldn't drive.

596
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.929
Are you crazy?

597
00:35:27.969 --> 00:35:29.840
I saved your life!

598
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.308
Oh, I would've been fine.

599
00:35:32.338 --> 00:35:34.279
I always am.

600
00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:35.868
Right.

601
00:35:35.908 --> 00:35:37.807
So ungrateful.

602
00:35:37.847 --> 00:35:39.278
It's just typical.

603
00:35:42.346 --> 00:35:44.007
And you chipped the paint!

604
00:35:44.047 --> 00:35:45.276
Right here...
look at it.

605
00:35:45.316 --> 00:35:46.905
That's more than
a little scratch.

606
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:09.530
The dog and the crew
and th-th-that woman!

607
00:36:18.878 --> 00:36:19.839
What?!

608
00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:21.678
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

609
00:36:21.748 --> 00:36:23.367
- No problem!
- Don't worry about it!

610
00:36:23.417 --> 00:36:24.538
- I won't!
- Good!

611
00:36:24.578 --> 00:36:25.947
- Good-bye!
- Bye to you!

612
00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:37.354
You happy now?

613
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.830
Proteus, come quickly.

614
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.840
What? Wh...?

615
00:37:02.879 --> 00:37:04.349
There's a ship
waiting in the harbor.

616
00:37:04.379 --> 00:37:05.708
A crew of my most
trusted officers

617
00:37:05.778 --> 00:37:07.039
will take you
far from Syracuse.

618
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.948
But the ambassadors' guards?

619
00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:10.878
Are asleep or well-bribed.

620
00:37:10.918 --> 00:37:12.347
But we must go now.

621
00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:14.476
Go where?

622
00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:16.916
To live the rest of my life
in exile?

623
00:37:16.956 --> 00:37:18.186
To live, son.

624
00:37:18.226 --> 00:37:21.126
I won't let them execute
you for Sinbad's crime.

625
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.385
Neither will Sinbad.

626
00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:24.054
Proteus, don't be foolish!

627
00:37:24.094 --> 00:37:26.464
Sinbad has no intention
of going to Tartarus.

628
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:28.433
The Sinbad you knew
as a child is...

629
00:37:28.463 --> 00:37:30.723
Is still in him as a man.

630
00:37:30.763 --> 00:37:32.562
I've seen it.

631
00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:34.763
Proteus...

632
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:38.962
Go, Father.

633
00:37:39.002 --> 00:37:41.670
I know what I'm doing.

634
00:38:00.056 --> 00:38:00.716
All right, listen up.

635
00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:02.017
We're here for ten minutes.

636
00:38:02.057 --> 00:38:03.816
You get lost, you get left.

637
00:38:06.966 --> 00:38:08.865
How did one woman
do so much damage?

638
00:38:10.434 --> 00:38:13.334
All right, I'm going to need
the full set of chisels,

639
00:38:13.364 --> 00:38:15.354
the jack plane,
and about a cord of cut wood.

640
00:38:15.564 --> 00:38:17.163
All right, men, you
heard the captain.

641
00:38:17.203 --> 00:38:19.532
Find some logs
and be quick about it.

642
00:38:19.572 --> 00:38:21.542
- Oh, for heaven's sake!

643
00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:23.131
You only need
a little tree sap,

644
00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:24.612
and she'll be
as good as new.

645
00:38:24.642 --> 00:38:26.371
When I want
your advice, I'll...

646
00:38:26.411 --> 00:38:27.501
Hey, hey, hey!

647
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:29.671
Where do you think
you're going?

648
00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:31.540
Well, fine!
At least take someone with y...

649
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.769
May I assist you, lady?

650
00:38:32.879 --> 00:38:34.410
- Why, thank you.

651
00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.709
- Right this way, signorina.
- How nice to see

652
00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:39.479
some men haven't forgotten
a little common courtesy.

653
00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:41.108
...common courtesy.

654
00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:42.377
Not so fast.

655
00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:43.518
But you know she's right.

656
00:38:43.558 --> 00:38:45.217
The tree sap would
be perfect for...

657
00:38:45.257 --> 00:38:46.516
Just...

658
00:38:46.556 --> 00:38:48.027
stay with the ship.

659
00:38:52.896 --> 00:38:54.695
I already said thank you.

660
00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:57.065
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?

661
00:38:57.105 --> 00:38:58.794
It's about repairing the ship.

662
00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:00.803
If I break something,
I fix it.

663
00:39:00.903 --> 00:39:02.564
Um, knife, please.

664
00:39:02.604 --> 00:39:06.473
Oh, yeah,
like I'd give you a weapon?

665
00:39:06.513 --> 00:39:08.502
Thank you, Rat.

666
00:39:08.542 --> 00:39:10.742
You know, you really
ought to be

667
00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:12.511
a little more courteous.

668
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.371
Oh, great.

669
00:39:15.411 --> 00:39:17.180
Now I'm getting
etiquette lessons

670
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.809
from a bilge rat.

671
00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:20.780
Well, she did save
the ship, Captain.

672
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.339
Why, thank you, Luca.

673
00:39:22.389 --> 00:39:24.288
And now she's helping to fix it.

674
00:39:24.318 --> 00:39:25.589
Very handy, I say.

675
00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:26.918
And brave!

676
00:39:26.958 --> 00:39:29.928
This... girl wouldn't know how
to fix a broken fingernail!

677
00:39:29.958 --> 00:39:31.827
Honestly, you are
the most boorish,

678
00:39:31.897 --> 00:39:35.027
pig-headed man
I've ever met.

679
00:39:35.067 --> 00:39:37.035
Hey, lady, I've seen
the highborn boys

680
00:39:37.065 --> 00:39:38.996
your type hangs out with...

681
00:39:39.036 --> 00:39:41.125
...and I'm the only man
you've ever met.

682
00:39:44.135 --> 00:39:45.834
- Whoa.

683
00:39:47.874 --> 00:39:49.843
- Mmm.

684
00:39:51.642 --> 00:39:54.972
Oh, no. No. No.

685
00:39:55.012 --> 00:39:56.441
No...

686
00:39:58.052 --> 00:40:00.210
Five on Marina.

687
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.939
You... you...

688
00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:06.680
egotistical...

689
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.249
- You spoiled...
- disrespectful,

690
00:40:08.289 --> 00:40:10.118
- deluded,
- pretentious, pompous,

691
00:40:10.158 --> 00:40:12.588
- high-and-mighty...
- self-centered, untrustworthy,

692
00:40:12.628 --> 00:40:15.528
ungrateful, impossible,
insufferable...

693
00:40:15.558 --> 00:40:17.027
At least I'm not repressed!

694
00:40:17.067 --> 00:40:18.257
Repressed?!

695
00:40:18.297 --> 00:40:20.127
I'll show you
repressed!

696
00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:30.794
What the...?

697
00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:39.473
Put it back.

698
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.751
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...

699
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:51.259
- Ew...

700
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:54.719
Ew!

701
00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:03.098
Run!

702
00:41:03.137 --> 00:41:05.096
- It's a fish!
- It's a fish!

703
00:41:05.136 --> 00:41:08.496
Kale!

704
00:41:08.536 --> 00:41:10.165
- Whoa!

705
00:41:21.713 --> 00:41:23.412
- Jump!

706
00:41:30.622 --> 00:41:31.751
Kale!

707
00:41:31.791 --> 00:41:32.750
Got it!

708
00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:41.618
Veer off, Kale!

709
00:41:41.658 --> 00:41:42.928
The star!

710
00:41:45.098 --> 00:41:46.327
Hold your heading!

711
00:41:46.367 --> 00:41:47.798
Rat, tie it off!

712
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.457
Wha... wha...

713
00:41:52.266 --> 00:41:53.537
Ha-ha!

714
00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:54.626
Wait!

715
00:42:09.183 --> 00:42:12.712
Yee-ha!

716
00:42:37.936 --> 00:42:39.267
Sinbad!

717
00:42:39.307 --> 00:42:41.396
The men can't take much more.

718
00:42:41.446 --> 00:42:43.065
I can't...

719
00:42:43.115 --> 00:42:44.606
take much more, either.

720
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:46.374
Cut the line!

721
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:02.222
- Oh, no, Spike!

722
00:43:02.262 --> 00:43:04.161
- Whoa, hold on, no...
- No, no, no, please...

723
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:07.181
- Oh, Spike!

724
00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:10.219
Hey, where'd he get
the carrots?

725
00:43:14.638 --> 00:43:16.869
Whose idea was that again?

726
00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:18.737
I don't know.

727
00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:22.507
But he owes me lunch.

728
00:43:27.046 --> 00:43:29.476
The Granite Gates.

729
00:43:29.516 --> 00:43:31.775
Bet you never thought
I'd get us this far.

730
00:43:31.815 --> 00:43:34.014
No, I didn't.

731
00:43:34.085 --> 00:43:36.314
But Proteus did.

732
00:43:36.354 --> 00:43:38.613
For some reason,
he trusts you.

733
00:43:40.054 --> 00:43:43.683
Well, what could
he have been thinking?

734
00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:46.192
How did you
two ever meet?

735
00:43:48.862 --> 00:43:50.421
Running for my
life, as usual.

736
00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:52.621
A couple of angry thugs
had cornered me

737
00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:54.190
outside the palace walls.

738
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:56.499
I was trapped.

739
00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:58.130
A sword at my throat,

740
00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.899
at my chest, at my...

741
00:43:59.939 --> 00:44:03.568
- Pickles and eggs!

742
00:44:05.137 --> 00:44:06.868
Well, you get the idea.

743
00:44:06.908 --> 00:44:09.846
And then suddenly,
there was a fourth blade.

744
00:44:09.876 --> 00:44:11.037
It was Proteus.

745
00:44:11.147 --> 00:44:13.546
You see, he'd watched it all
from his room in the palace.

746
00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:14.705
He actually climbed down

747
00:44:14.745 --> 00:44:16.876
the castle wall
to fight at my side,

748
00:44:16.916 --> 00:44:18.505
and, boy, did we fight.

749
00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:21.215
It was like we'd rehearsed it.

750
00:44:21.255 --> 00:44:24.243
We were best friends
from that day forward.

751
00:44:24.293 --> 00:44:27.283
What happened with you two?

752
00:44:32.631 --> 00:44:34.962
What is it?

753
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:38.991
We... took different paths.

754
00:44:50.148 --> 00:44:52.738
Enough talking.

755
00:44:52.778 --> 00:44:56.046
Time for some screaming.

756
00:45:14.192 --> 00:45:18.032
For crying out loud,
what next?

757
00:45:18.062 --> 00:45:19.761
Oh, get a shirt on

758
00:45:19.801 --> 00:45:22.131
before you poke
someone's eye out.

759
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.740
Okay, guys, get down there
and break it up!

760
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.469
We've got to keep moving!

761
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.509
Steal the Book of Peace.

762
00:45:35.049 --> 00:45:36.778
We will retire in the tropics.

763
00:46:09.401 --> 00:46:11.100
Everyone, back on the ship!

764
00:46:11.141 --> 00:46:12.331
Hurry!

765
00:46:12.371 --> 00:46:15.069
Come on! Come on! Move faster!

766
00:46:30.057 --> 00:46:30.917
Jed!

767
00:46:35.356 --> 00:46:37.384
Grab the rope!

768
00:46:42.393 --> 00:46:43.734
Rat, your hand!

769
00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:46.053
Marina!

770
00:47:38.011 --> 00:47:39.842
<i>Rat! Don't let</i>

771
00:47:39.872 --> 00:47:41.471
- the blocks freeze!
- Aye, aye, Captain.

772
00:47:41.511 --> 00:47:43.200
- And, Kale!
- Aye!

773
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.070
Give me a hug?

774
00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.340
Excuse me?

775
00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:49.610
Hmph.

776
00:48:21.373 --> 00:48:24.171
Oh, she couldn't see the bird?

777
00:48:24.211 --> 00:48:26.731
Everyone else saw it.

778
00:48:28.111 --> 00:48:30.511
It's as big as a freakin' ship.

779
00:48:30.551 --> 00:48:34.750
Marina?
Marina's looking the other way.

780
00:48:43.598 --> 00:48:45.647
- Shh, shh, shh.

781
00:48:48.066 --> 00:48:49.796
You're rescuing me!

782
00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.825
Yes, if that's what
you want to call it.

783
00:48:52.866 --> 00:48:55.355
But this is going
to cost you another diamond.

784
00:48:55.405 --> 00:48:58.895
Rescues aren't part
of the usual tourist package.

785
00:49:01.573 --> 00:49:02.904
So...

786
00:49:02.944 --> 00:49:04.463
how are we going
to get down?

787
00:49:04.513 --> 00:49:05.872
I... I don't know.

788
00:49:05.912 --> 00:49:08.103
- What?!
- I don't know yet.

789
00:49:08.143 --> 00:49:09.971
I'm thinking about it,
all right?

790
00:49:10.011 --> 00:49:12.282
You scaled a thousand-
foot tower of ice,

791
00:49:12.352 --> 00:49:14.211
and you don't know
how to get down?

792
00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.840
Of all the ungrateful...

793
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.110
Look, if you'd rather
take your chances on your own,

794
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:19.279
that can be arranged.

795
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:20.880
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
All right.

796
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.249
All right.

797
00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.759
So,

798
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:27.418
what do we have
to work with?

799
00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:28.927
Um... ropes?

800
00:49:28.957 --> 00:49:30.758
Uh... no.

801
00:49:30.798 --> 00:49:31.927
Uh, grappling hooks?

802
00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:33.516
Yeah... no.

803
00:49:33.566 --> 00:49:34.727
Your swords?

804
00:49:35.966 --> 00:49:37.725
Hey, I've got this.

805
00:49:37.765 --> 00:49:39.066
Oh, great.

806
00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:40.965
He can pick his teeth
when he's done with us.

807
00:49:41.005 --> 00:49:42.134
Yeah.

808
00:49:42.174 --> 00:49:44.105
Okay. See,
in the hands of an expert,

809
00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:45.904
a good knife has 1,001 uses.

810
00:49:45.944 --> 00:49:47.963
- Ooh!

811
00:49:51.942 --> 00:49:54.742
uh...

812
00:49:56.281 --> 00:49:57.682
Run!

813
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.151
Come on! Faster!

814
00:50:05.719 --> 00:50:07.850
W- Wait, wait. What?

815
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.118
Let's go!

816
00:50:10.158 --> 00:50:13.128
No...!

817
00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:17.058
Oh! Oh!

818
00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:26.166
- Oh!
- Ah!

819
00:50:29.374 --> 00:50:31.175
I think we lost him!

820
00:50:31.215 --> 00:50:34.183
- I don't think so!
- Heads down!

821
00:50:36.643 --> 00:50:38.942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa!

822
00:50:38.982 --> 00:50:41.282
- Whoa!

823
00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.811
- Oh, no!

824
00:50:56.298 --> 00:50:57.198
Lean right!

825
00:51:07.137 --> 00:51:09.126
- Whew.

826
00:51:09.176 --> 00:51:11.005
- Come on!

827
00:51:23.723 --> 00:51:26.413
- Hang on!

828
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.199
Yep, there they are.

829
00:51:52.106 --> 00:51:54.167
There...

830
00:51:54.207 --> 00:51:56.405
Just as I... planned.

831
00:52:01.044 --> 00:52:03.075
It's Marina!

832
00:52:06.513 --> 00:52:10.642
We thought you
were gone forever!

833
00:52:11.823 --> 00:52:13.292
Oh, I'm fine. Really.

834
00:52:13.322 --> 00:52:15.721
But I'm touched by your concern.

835
00:52:32.968 --> 00:52:34.307
Yee-ha!

836
00:53:07.571 --> 00:53:09.800
Sinbad?

837
00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:13.429
Thank you for coming after me.

838
00:53:13.469 --> 00:53:16.459
Well, y...

839
00:53:16.569 --> 00:53:18.438
you're welcome.

840
00:53:21.208 --> 00:53:23.577
This life suits you.

841
00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:24.806
Yeah.

842
00:53:24.846 --> 00:53:26.777
I wasn't made for dry land.

843
00:53:28.515 --> 00:53:30.146
And you?

844
00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:32.945
Is it the shore... or the sea?

845
00:53:34.584 --> 00:53:37.284
I've always loved the sea.

846
00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:41.053
I even dreamed
of a life on it.

847
00:53:41.093 --> 00:53:43.062
But it wasn't meant to be.

848
00:53:43.092 --> 00:53:46.422
I have responsibilities
in Syracuse.

849
00:53:46.462 --> 00:53:49.292
You really have to give it up?

850
00:53:50.601 --> 00:53:53.661
Yes.

851
00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:21.925
You know, I've
traveled the world,

852
00:54:21.955 --> 00:54:24.683
seen things no other
man has seen...

853
00:54:24.723 --> 00:54:26.924
but nothing...

854
00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:31.123
nothing compares
to the open sea.

855
00:54:31.163 --> 00:54:34.151
And is this what
you always wanted?

856
00:54:34.201 --> 00:54:36.631
Not really.

857
00:54:36.671 --> 00:54:38.360
When we were young,
Proteus and I

858
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.531
used to talk about
joining the Royal Navy

859
00:54:40.641 --> 00:54:43.539
and serving Syracuse
side by side.

860
00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:47.978
But as we got older,
our lives began to change.

861
00:54:48.008 --> 00:54:52.707
He's a prince,
and I'm... well.

862
00:54:55.047 --> 00:54:57.486
I was never jealous
of him, though...

863
00:54:57.516 --> 00:55:00.456
until one morning,
a ship came into harbor...

864
00:55:00.486 --> 00:55:04.445
a ship with his
future on it.

865
00:55:04.495 --> 00:55:07.755
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

866
00:55:07.795 --> 00:55:10.523
What was on the ship?

867
00:55:13.493 --> 00:55:15.092
You.

868
00:55:16.162 --> 00:55:19.002
Proteus met you
at the dock.

869
00:55:19.032 --> 00:55:20.932
I jumped on the
first outbound ship

870
00:55:20.972 --> 00:55:22.871
and never looked back.

871
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.831
Until now.

872
00:56:12.641 --> 00:56:14.660
Rat! Give me a lookout!

873
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:23.578
We're dead.

874
00:56:23.608 --> 00:56:24.907
What is it?!

875
00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:26.638
I- I-It just ends, Captain!

876
00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:28.547
It's the edge of the world!

877
00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.116
Pay up. It's flat.

878
00:56:34.485 --> 00:56:36.455
Well, that's it.
Time to go home.

879
00:56:36.485 --> 00:56:37.455
Nuh-uh-uh.

880
00:56:37.485 --> 00:56:39.655
The captain hasn't
given his orders yet.

881
00:56:42.424 --> 00:56:45.054
Follow that star
beyond the horizon.

882
00:56:45.094 --> 00:56:47.822
Beyond the horizon.

883
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.731
Sinbad?

884
00:56:58.771 --> 00:57:00.500
Men! All hands to your posts!

885
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.700
Free all sheets!
Wait for my command!

886
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.040
What?

887
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.068
Now! Go! Go! Go!

888
00:57:06.108 --> 00:57:07.979
Eh, Sinbad, how-how are
we gonna pull this off?

889
00:57:08.009 --> 00:57:09.308
Just trust me.

890
00:57:09.348 --> 00:57:11.818
Rat! Rig the main yard
to the fors'le!

891
00:57:11.848 --> 00:57:13.338
But that would stop us dead!

892
00:57:13.387 --> 00:57:14.047
Just do it!

893
00:57:14.087 --> 00:57:15.646
Aye, aye, Captain.

894
00:57:18.486 --> 00:57:20.355
Whoa!

895
00:57:20.385 --> 00:57:21.826
Slack to all sheets!

896
00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:23.325
Aye, aye, Cap'n!

897
00:57:23.355 --> 00:57:24.514
Cut the fore and main trusses!

898
00:57:24.624 --> 00:57:27.224
- Move! Move! Move!

899
00:57:27.264 --> 00:57:29.853
I got it. I got it. I got it.

900
00:57:29.893 --> 00:57:30.864
Aft yard astern!

901
00:57:30.894 --> 00:57:31.863
But that's...

902
00:57:31.903 --> 00:57:33.233
Crazy, I know! Now hurry!

903
00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:36.033
Here, grab it!

904
00:57:36.073 --> 00:57:37.472
Go!

905
00:57:37.502 --> 00:57:38.691
Swing the fors'le to port!

906
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:41.531
Ease the aft!
Full hoist to forward sails!

907
00:57:41.641 --> 00:57:43.230
Aye, aye, Captain.

908
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:44.261
Come on!

909
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:45.541
Pull!

910
00:57:52.118 --> 00:57:54.279
Tie off all sails!

911
00:57:54.319 --> 00:57:57.217
All hands amidships!

912
00:57:57.247 --> 00:57:58.878
And pray to the gods.

913
00:57:58.918 --> 00:58:01.446
We may be meeting them soon.

914
00:58:13.434 --> 00:58:15.593
We're going to die.

915
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:33.240
Hold on! Grab the rope!

916
00:58:36.849 --> 00:58:38.908
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

917
00:58:59.405 --> 00:59:01.333
It worked?

918
00:59:01.363 --> 00:59:02.994
Sinbad...

919
00:59:03.034 --> 00:59:04.333
...you did it.

920
00:59:17.611 --> 00:59:19.879
- Grab hold!

921
00:59:19.919 --> 00:59:22.110
Grum, hard to port!

922
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:24.049
Hard to port!

923
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:27.119
- Kale!
- Aye!

924
00:59:27.159 --> 00:59:29.127
If I don't make it,
the ship is yours.

925
00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:30.848
No.

926
00:59:30.888 --> 00:59:32.617
Gentlemen, it's
been a privilege

927
00:59:32.727 --> 00:59:34.246
robbing with you.

928
00:59:36.626 --> 00:59:38.615
I'm coming with you.

929
00:59:38.695 --> 00:59:39.926
And don't tell me

930
00:59:39.966 --> 00:59:42.864
the Realm of Chaos is
no place for a woman.

931
00:59:44.705 --> 00:59:46.534
Hmm.

932
00:59:46.574 --> 00:59:48.904
I would never say that.

933
00:59:52.742 --> 00:59:54.933
Hey, sorry, boy.

934
00:59:54.973 --> 00:59:56.342
Not this time.

935
01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:45.941
Huh?

936
01:01:25.012 --> 01:01:26.503
- Huh?
- Huh?

937
01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:39.830
Now, now, my pets.

938
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.489
Is this any way
to treat a guest?

939
01:01:52.106 --> 01:01:55.726
Okay, I'm severely creeped out.

940
01:01:55.806 --> 01:01:58.235
Bravo.

941
01:01:58.276 --> 01:02:01.534
No mortal has ever made it
to Tartarus before.

942
01:02:02.915 --> 01:02:05.374
Alive, that is...

943
01:02:06.613 --> 01:02:07.604
Make yourself at home.

944
01:02:09.253 --> 01:02:10.642
Thank you. Uh...

945
01:02:10.682 --> 01:02:12.012
nice place you got here.

946
01:02:12.052 --> 01:02:13.413
Like it?

947
01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:16.681
I'm planning on doing
the whole world this way.

948
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:21.080
Wow, that's a good plan.

949
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.960
Well, I see you're busy,
so listen, we'll just take

950
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.120
the Book of Peace
and get of your way.

951
01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:28.759
What makes you think I have it?

952
01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:31.199
Uh, well, you framed me
for the theft,

953
01:02:31.229 --> 01:02:32.758
so they would execute me.

954
01:02:32.798 --> 01:02:34.057
You?

955
01:02:34.097 --> 01:02:35.087
Yeah.

956
01:02:37.607 --> 01:02:39.396
No.

957
01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:40.697
Proteus!

958
01:02:40.737 --> 01:02:42.766
You knew he would take my place.

959
01:02:44.175 --> 01:02:45.936
What a clever little man
you are.

960
01:02:45.976 --> 01:02:47.564
You thought I'd run.

961
01:02:47.614 --> 01:02:51.374
Then Proteus would die,
and Syracuse would be...

962
01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:53.784
Left without
the next rightful king,

963
01:02:53.884 --> 01:02:57.872
and tumble into glorious chaos.

964
01:02:57.922 --> 01:03:01.282
You humans are so predictable.

965
01:03:01.322 --> 01:03:03.982
Proteus couldn't help
being ever so noble,

966
01:03:04.022 --> 01:03:06.320
and you couldn't help
betraying him.

967
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.490
But I didn't betray Proteus!
I didn't run away.

968
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.499
Oh, but you did betray him.

969
01:03:11.529 --> 01:03:14.059
You stole his only love.

970
01:03:14.099 --> 01:03:15.288
Look at her, Sinbad.

971
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:18.738
He's not even
in his grave yet,

972
01:03:18.768 --> 01:03:21.367
and you're moving in
on his girl.

973
01:03:21.407 --> 01:03:26.807
Face it: Your heart
is as black as mine.

974
01:03:26.877 --> 01:03:28.636
You're wrong about him!

975
01:03:28.676 --> 01:03:29.975
He knows I'm not!

976
01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.446
You don't know
what's in his heart.

977
01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:33.175
Oh, yes, I do.

978
01:03:33.215 --> 01:03:36.145
And more importantly,
so does he.

979
01:03:36.185 --> 01:03:37.654
In your heart,
you know that

980
01:03:37.684 --> 01:03:39.583
Proteus is
going to die

981
01:03:39.623 --> 01:03:42.023
because he saw
something in you

982
01:03:42.053 --> 01:03:44.112
that just isn't there.

983
01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:45.453
No.

984
01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:46.792
You want to bet?

985
01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:49.592
I'll tell you what.
Let's play a game.

986
01:03:49.632 --> 01:03:51.681
And if you win,
I'll give you

987
01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:53.090
the Book of Peace.

988
01:03:58.269 --> 01:04:00.359
There it is, noble hero.

989
01:04:02.068 --> 01:04:05.198
Not so fast.

990
01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:07.367
My game has rules,
Sinbad.

991
01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:09.377
I'll ask you a question.

992
01:04:09.407 --> 01:04:11.396
One simple question.

993
01:04:11.446 --> 01:04:15.006
If you answer truthfully,
the Book is yours.

994
01:04:15.046 --> 01:04:17.076
- Give me your word.

995
01:04:17.116 --> 01:04:19.245
You still don't trust me?

996
01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:21.585
Uh... no.

997
01:04:21.615 --> 01:04:25.713
Isn't it a pity
we live in such skeptical times?

998
01:04:25.753 --> 01:04:27.244
Oh, all right.

999
01:04:27.294 --> 01:04:30.853
You have my word, as a goddess.

1000
01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:33.722
Fair enough?

1001
01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:38.430
Ask your question.

1002
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.520
Excellent.

1003
01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.800
Now, we all know what happens

1004
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.059
if you get the Book of Peace.

1005
01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:47.369
You return it to Syracuse
and save Proteus.

1006
01:04:47.409 --> 01:04:49.639
But if you don't get the Book,

1007
01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:51.638
you have
a choice to make.

1008
01:04:51.678 --> 01:04:53.537
Either sail to paradise

1009
01:04:53.577 --> 01:04:55.308
with the woman
of your dreams,

1010
01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:59.047
or return to Syracuse to die.

1011
01:04:59.087 --> 01:05:01.845
You're either a thief or a hero.

1012
01:05:01.885 --> 01:05:04.546
So, here's my question, Sinbad.

1013
01:05:04.586 --> 01:05:07.284
If you don't get the Book,

1014
01:05:07.324 --> 01:05:10.314
will you go back to die?

1015
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:26.321
I will go back.

1016
01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:40.148
You're lying.

1017
01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:24.378
I'm sorry, Marina.

1018
01:06:24.418 --> 01:06:27.148
Eris is right about me.

1019
01:06:27.188 --> 01:06:29.516
No, she's not.
You answered her question.

1020
01:06:29.556 --> 01:06:30.676
You told the truth.

1021
01:06:30.716 --> 01:06:33.386
It wasn't the truth.

1022
01:06:33.426 --> 01:06:36.786
It was me trying to pass
myself off as someone I'm not.

1023
01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.624
Sinbad,
I've seen who you are!

1024
01:06:38.654 --> 01:06:40.285
You don't need to pretend!

1025
01:06:40.325 --> 01:06:41.555
Eris trapped you!

1026
01:06:41.595 --> 01:06:45.224
Why should you or Proteus
or anyone have to die?!

1027
01:06:45.264 --> 01:06:45.964
Marina...

1028
01:06:46.004 --> 01:06:48.052
No! You need to escape.

1029
01:06:48.102 --> 01:06:50.333
Get as far away as you can.

1030
01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.431
I'll go back.
I'll explain everything.

1031
01:06:52.471 --> 01:06:53.331
No, Marina.

1032
01:06:54.902 --> 01:06:58.971
I can't watch you die!

1033
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.139
I love you.

1034
01:07:27.465 --> 01:07:31.564
But could you love a man
who would run away?

1035
01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:41.049
I bet you thought
I wouldn't make it.

1036
01:08:42.088 --> 01:08:43.577
I was...

1037
01:08:43.627 --> 01:08:46.318
...beginning to wonder.

1038
01:08:50.967 --> 01:08:52.056
The Book?

1039
01:08:52.096 --> 01:08:55.396
I did my best.

1040
01:08:55.436 --> 01:08:57.334
It wasn't enough.

1041
01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:01.903
No.

1042
01:09:01.933 --> 01:09:04.164
You came back anyway.

1043
01:09:04.204 --> 01:09:09.443
How could I do anything else...
my friend?

1044
01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:21.756
Get back!

1045
01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:40.383
How dare you?!

1046
01:10:40.413 --> 01:10:44.281
Everything
was going perfectly,

1047
01:10:44.321 --> 01:10:47.151
and now you do this!

1048
01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:53.989
Eris, I don't understand.

1049
01:10:54.029 --> 01:10:56.149
Don't play coy with me.

1050
01:10:56.259 --> 01:10:59.889
Maybe you can fool these people,

1051
01:10:59.929 --> 01:11:01.698
but I know who you are.

1052
01:11:01.728 --> 01:11:05.967
You're a selfish,
unprincipled liar!

1053
01:11:06.007 --> 01:11:07.626
Wait a minute.

1054
01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:09.696
I didn't lie.

1055
01:11:09.736 --> 01:11:11.395
I came back.

1056
01:11:11.435 --> 01:11:12.836
That's why you're here.

1057
01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:15.005
This was all part
of your test.

1058
01:11:15.045 --> 01:11:16.274
I told the truth.

1059
01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:18.005
And wasn't there something

1060
01:11:18.045 --> 01:11:20.413
about being
"bound for all eternity"?

1061
01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:45.199
Well, well, well.

1062
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:48.137
This has got to be a little
embarrassing for you, Eris.

1063
01:11:49.267 --> 01:11:51.707
Don't push your luck, Sinbad.

1064
01:11:51.737 --> 01:11:55.607
You're cute,
but not that cute.

1065
01:11:57.276 --> 01:12:00.715
And lucky for you,
I've got places to go,

1066
01:12:00.745 --> 01:12:05.474
things to destroy,
stuff to steal.

1067
01:12:05.514 --> 01:12:07.043
Ta.

1068
01:12:57.592 --> 01:12:59.823
You know,
for what it's worth,

1069
01:12:59.863 --> 01:13:02.721
I think the council
believes you now.

1070
01:13:05.761 --> 01:13:08.461
You think?

1071
01:13:15.299 --> 01:13:17.699
King Dymas.

1072
01:13:17.739 --> 01:13:19.208
Uh, whoa, hey.

1073
01:13:19.238 --> 01:13:20.468
How much you got on you?

1074
01:13:20.507 --> 01:13:24.667
I offer you the gratitude
of the Twelve Cities,

1075
01:13:24.707 --> 01:13:27.647
and the apology of a king.

1076
01:13:28.646 --> 01:13:30.115
No, really. How much?

1077
01:13:30.145 --> 01:13:32.276
Sinbad.

1078
01:13:38.924 --> 01:13:39.983
Come on.

1079
01:13:40.023 --> 01:13:41.994
This is going to be
a heck of a party.

1080
01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:44.622
Everyone's going to want
to hear about the voyage.

1081
01:13:44.662 --> 01:13:46.283
Fair winds, calm seas.

1082
01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:48.521
Nothing much to tell.

1083
01:13:50.162 --> 01:13:51.222
What's the matter?

1084
01:13:51.262 --> 01:13:53.490
No fun if you're
actually invited?

1085
01:13:58.599 --> 01:14:00.699
No, it's just, uh...

1086
01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:03.228
there's a hammock in Fiji
with my name on it.

1087
01:14:09.048 --> 01:14:11.776
Good sailing, Sinbad.

1088
01:14:13.217 --> 01:14:14.616
Get a haircut.

1089
01:14:14.646 --> 01:14:17.415
You're going to be king someday.

1090
01:14:53.277 --> 01:14:54.608
Just another

1091
01:14:54.648 --> 01:14:56.947
uneventful day in Syracuse.

1092
01:15:02.785 --> 01:15:05.685
You know, I stood here
with a woman once.

1093
01:15:05.725 --> 01:15:07.654
She looked over the ocean

1094
01:15:07.694 --> 01:15:10.354
and wished she could sail
beyond the horizon.

1095
01:15:10.394 --> 01:15:13.834
She saw... such wonder.

1096
01:15:13.864 --> 01:15:17.693
And what happened
to this woman?

1097
01:15:17.733 --> 01:15:19.792
She got her chance.

1098
01:15:19.832 --> 01:15:24.291
She sailed the seas,
and she fell in love.

1099
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.600
Proteus, I...

1100
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.369
Marina, follow your heart.

1101
01:15:33.479 --> 01:15:36.279
Mine is here in Syracuse.

1102
01:15:36.319 --> 01:15:37.908
Yours...

1103
01:15:37.948 --> 01:15:42.148
yours is sailing
with the next tide.

1104
01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:47.746
Oh, Proteus.

1105
01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:06.931
Captain?

1106
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:08.161
Hmm?

1107
01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:10.261
We're ready to sail.

1108
01:16:10.311 --> 01:16:12.400
All right, Kale.

1109
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:14.640
Take us out.

1110
01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.139
Aye, aye, Captain.

1111
01:16:16.179 --> 01:16:17.770
Cast off!

1112
01:16:40.695 --> 01:16:42.225
Oh... Rat!

1113
01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.254
What?

1114
01:16:46.474 --> 01:16:48.592
Excuse me, Captain.

1115
01:16:48.632 --> 01:16:51.433
You need to replace
these rig joints pretty soon.

1116
01:16:51.502 --> 01:16:53.471
The mizzen ropes
need the support.

1117
01:16:55.542 --> 01:16:58.600
These joints
were from the Jasmine Sea.

1118
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.980
That's halfway around the world.

1119
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:03.139
Then we'd better get started.

1120
01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:09.449
Well, you know,

1121
01:17:09.519 --> 01:17:11.348
that means going through
the Hydra's lair.

1122
01:17:11.388 --> 01:17:13.258
- Mm-hmm.
- The Minotaur's haven.

1123
01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:14.448
- Mm-hmm.
- The Cyclops' den.

1124
01:17:14.528 --> 01:17:16.116
- Mm-hmm.
- Under the Swansea Bridge.

1125
01:17:16.156 --> 01:17:18.127
- Mm-hmm.
- Through the China Seas.

1126
01:17:18.157 --> 01:17:19.956
That's a very long voyage.

1127
01:17:19.996 --> 01:17:24.395
And it's very, very dangerous.

1128
01:17:24.435 --> 01:17:25.724
Don't worry.

1129
01:17:25.764 --> 01:17:28.065
I'll protect you.

1130
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.811
Oh, Spike.

1131
01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:47.650
Spike.

1132
01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.450
Spike... down.
