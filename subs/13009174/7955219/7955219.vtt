1
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.302
Good morning.

2
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.738
Stop it.

3
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:27.675
You have nothing
to be grumpy about.

4
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.713
Well... Thank you.

5
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.549
I do have reasons to be worried.

6
00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:36.984
I haven't said a word
about us to anyone from work.

7
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.554
How about anyone not from work?

8
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.488
You really have
to chill about this.

9
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.490
You work for me.

10
00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.526
Who cares about
what people think?

11
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:49.305
You not seeing
this as a problem...

12
00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.933
...makes it an even
bigger problem.

13
00:03:58.005 --> 00:03:59.574
Sweet Jesus!

14
00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.544
Those are the ones you like.

15
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.615
You have a rosary
on the night table.

16
00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:11.384
Is it new?

17
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:13.588
It belonged to my grandmother.

18
00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:14.956
Sure, whatever.

19
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.924
It's a family Relic.

20
00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:19.193
Eat your muffin.

21
00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:34.374
Do you think Aaron
seems a little off lately?

22
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.879
I don't think he ever looked on.

23
00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:41.625
I understand why he's
feeling so uncomfortable.

24
00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:45.019
Especially now that
we are so close.

25
00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:48.421
He knew what this whole thing
was about. Don't feel sorry for him.

26
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.992
His feelings are little
hurt. Who cares.

27
00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.661
This is bigger than him,
bigger than any of us.

28
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:56.264
If we succeed today I don't think
it's gonna be okay with the results.

29
00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.431
When we succeed today.

30
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.170
Making history is troubling.

31
00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.572
Talk to Elijah.

32
00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:06.607
He'll know what to do
about his condition.

33
00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:10.778
Faith is not a condition.
It's an it's an antivirus!

34
00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:13.181
All right, okay.

35
00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:15.950
I've already heard that speech.

36
00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:17.785
Look...

37
00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:19.954
Talk to Elijah.

38
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.421
I already did.

39
00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.524
Right after we moved
into the lab.

40
00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.902
He didn't seem to have...

41
00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:25.993
...any problems with Aaron then.

42
00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.261
Talk to him again.

43
00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:29.597
He might seem to have
a problem with him now.

44
00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.333
Anyway...

45
00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:34.969
Finish that and go.

46
00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:38.471
You kicking me out already?

47
00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.344
We're not gonna walk
in the lab holding hands.

48
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.949
One can only dream.

49
00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:56.324
You want to run it again?

50
00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:57.992
No need.

51
00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.359
We can do it.

52
00:05:59.527 --> 00:06:01.229
I know we can but...

53
00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.798
...it wouldn't make
any difference.

54
00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:05.398
You don't know that.

55
00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.535
We've run it five times already.

56
00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:11.539
So run it a sixth and
a seventh and an eighth.

57
00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:17.645
I believe it's time to
accept the results.

58
00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.881
Fuck your results!
That's out of line, Aaron!

59
00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:21.381
Fuck your results
and fuck you all!

60
00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.893
I heard you
the first time, Aaron!

61
00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:24.585
- I know how you feel.
- The fuck you do.

62
00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:26.554
What makes you think I'm
not feeling the same way?

63
00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.131
Cause you don't
have any fucking faith...

64
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.365
You just want to
destroy everything...

65
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.259
That's all you've been
after since all this started.

66
00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.903
You're right.
I don't have any faith.

67
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:35.572
I don't believe in a higher
power that supervises everything.

68
00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.397
How could you
possibly know how I feel?

69
00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.216
I didn't destroy anything.

70
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.076
I wanted answers. Like you,
like everybody here.

71
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:50.611
Some answer you found.

72
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.914
The truth hurts. I know.

73
00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:56.951
Aaron... Get te
fuck away from me.

74
00:06:58.286 --> 00:07:00.230
Our names will be
next to Copernicus...

75
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:03.124
...and Galileo in
the history books.

76
00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:04.424
Get the fuck away from me!

77
00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:19.307
No, no!

78
00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:29.383
Nobody move!

79
00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.217
Stop!

80
00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:32.887
He's bleeding.

81
00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:34.487
Everybody stay back.

82
00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.757
He needs an ambulance. Now.

83
00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:50.671
Call a fucking ambulance. Now!

84
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:15.463
Are you sure you're not cold?

85
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.497
What makes you think
I would lie about that?

86
00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:18.599
Beats me...

87
00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:20.167
...kind of like every other
thing that you do.

88
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.270
Closer to death every
minute. No time for bullshit.

89
00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:24.939
Well...

90
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.442
Thank you, Phil.

91
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.345
You're welcome, Angelina.

92
00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:34.115
Hey Phil. Is she giving
you a hard time?

93
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.049
When is she not?

94
00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:36.217
Morning, mom.

95
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.353
He keeps insisting
I wear a sweater. I'm not cold.

96
00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:40.888
How many ways do
I have to tell him?

97
00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:42.723
He's just trying to do
his job. That's all.

98
00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:43.657
Annoying.

99
00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:45.860
Whatever...

100
00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:47.795
Thank you, Phil.

101
00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:48.996
You're welcome.

102
00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.800
What did you bring me?

103
00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:54.011
Don't blow it, all right?

104
00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.703
It was hard enough
finding this place.

105
00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.638
This zoo you mean.

106
00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.407
Chocolate.

107
00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:00.841
I love chocolate.

108
00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.209
I know.

109
00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:06.247
So...

110
00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:09.650
How is your video thing going?

111
00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.218
Still like it?

112
00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:12.586
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

113
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.056
You are a news reporter...

114
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.425
Should have an
office job like I did.

115
00:09:17.526 --> 00:09:18.559
Better yet...

116
00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.761
Be a pretty face anchor.
Less exposed.

117
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:22.396
No, thank you.

118
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.400
You certainly have the face for
it.

119
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:29.270
Look...

120
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.173
There are two kinds
of people in this world...

121
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.909
The ones who like themselves
and the ones that don't.

122
00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:36.987
You have to decide which
one you're going to be...

123
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:39.413
...and I strongly
recommend the former.

124
00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:48.557
What did you bring me today?

125
00:09:52.126 --> 00:09:54.028
Chocolates.

126
00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.633
Great... I love chocolate.

127
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.573
I know, mom.

128
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.554
This is it. Utilities
are not included.

129
00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:29.430
I'll take.

130
00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:31.999
You haven't even seen
the whole place yet.

131
00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:36.437
I'll take it.

132
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:38.239
Okay...

133
00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:41.308
I'll... uh... need to check
your credit score...

134
00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:44.145
I'll get back to you
as soon as I do so.

135
00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.148
This will cover six months.

136
00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:59.126
Church collection box.

137
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.697
I'll take the jacket too.

138
00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:16.611
Six months...

139
00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:18.946
That's it.

140
00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:46.840
How is he?

141
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:49.410
Still in surgery.

142
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.049
I sent a team to go and try to
find him he shouldn't be too far.

143
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:57.751
I want to go too.
They're already out there.

144
00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:58.886
Who do you send?

145
00:11:58.919 --> 00:11:59.920
Katherine y Robert.

146
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:00.997
Those pencil pushers?

147
00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:02.723
I can't send the cops
now, can I?

148
00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:04.758
I know him.
I can find him first.

149
00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:06.427
I'm sure you can.

150
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.305
I told you he was
going to be trouble...

151
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:10.240
You could have done something
about it. So this is my fault?

152
00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:11.765
That's what you're saying?

153
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:19.173
That's not what I meant.

154
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.876
Look, this isn't easy for any of
us.

155
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.690
That's why you have to
let me go after him...

156
00:12:25.714 --> 00:12:28.048
I'm not saying I can
predict his moves...

157
00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.552
...but I've been working
with you for five years...

158
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.920
...Got to know him pretty well.

159
00:12:37.592 --> 00:12:39.460
Use whatever means necessary.

160
00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:44.131
Whatever means necessary,
do you understand?

161
00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:47.768
He cannot talk.

162
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:51.772
He won't

163
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.914
Stop!

164
00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.751
Please. Stop!

165
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:42.256
Tell me, priest...

166
00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:44.458
Why did God make us?

167
00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:47.161
What's the meaning of life?

168
00:13:48.162 --> 00:13:49.263
What?

169
00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:51.131
The meaning of life. What is it?

170
00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:53.033
To love and serve God.

171
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:55.501
To love and serve others.

172
00:13:56.805 --> 00:14:00.341
God put us on this earth
to care for each other.

173
00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.110
Then why did he put
us here in the first place?

174
00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:13.187
Aaron!

175
00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:16.857
Yes... Aaron.

176
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:21.228
But... why?

177
00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.898
You don't have a clue, do you?

178
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:08.375
Excuse me.

179
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.384
Get back here!
Get back in the house!

180
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.986
Leave me alone!

181
00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:20.387
You're acting crazy!

182
00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:21.355
Fuck you!

183
00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:23.223
It's gonna bee alright,
my sweet baby girl...

184
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:24.893
- Get back in there!
- Fuck you!

185
00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:26.960
Leah, my sweet baby girl.

186
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:29.363
Don't touch her.
Don't you touch her!

187
00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.524
Hey, this is Lance Abad...

188
00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:31.425
...You know the 'beep' routine.

189
00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.328
Hey Lance. It's Daneen...

190
00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:38.499
I know you can't answer
your phone right now...

191
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.170
I just wanted to
let you know that I...

192
00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:44.973
...I didn't see this coming...

193
00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:48.442
...I didn't see it.
I should have but...

194
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.550
I'm gonna find Aaron and
make him pay for this.

195
00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:02.657
Next time I'd see you...

196
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.461
I'd love to walk in the lab
holding hands with you.

197
00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:50.772
Leah, you did a great job today.

198
00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:54.207
What's wrong?

199
00:17:55.043 --> 00:17:56.243
Did you see a ghost?

200
00:17:57.045 --> 00:17:58.378
Sorry...

201
00:17:59.614 --> 00:18:01.616
...I thought that
I saw somebody.

202
00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:02.750
You alright?

203
00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:04.586
Yeah.

204
00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.454
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
that you did a great job today.

205
00:18:07.889 --> 00:18:08.856
Murder scene footage.

206
00:18:08.923 --> 00:18:09.891
Oh... yeah...

207
00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:11.893
Thank you.

208
00:18:12.192 --> 00:18:13.728
You've already told me
that up there though.

209
00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:17.440
Actually I wanted to tell you that I'm having
a dinner party at my place this Saturday.

210
00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:20.068
...I mean just a few friends and
some other work-related people.

211
00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.637
- Great... Have fun. A
- MATT: I wanted you to come.

212
00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:26.074
If you want to, of course.
No obligation.

213
00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.810
I have to go to Village Park.

214
00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.545
What's Village Park?

215
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:33.581
It's a retirement home
that mom's in.

216
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:35.717
On Saturday night?

217
00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:38.820
Yeah... She's not doing well so
I...

218
00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:40.955
...have to go and take care of
her.

219
00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.124
Okay then. Your loss.

220
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.660
Thank you anyway.

221
00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:48.328
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah. Yes, of course.

222
00:18:58.506 --> 00:19:00.340
Hi. You've
reached Aaron Swafford.

223
00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:02.285
Can't come to the
phone right now...

224
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.578
Please leave a message.

225
00:19:03.778 --> 00:19:05.813
Hey Aaron. It's Daneen again...

226
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:09.182
There's only one way to make
things right.

227
00:19:09.984 --> 00:19:11.184
Call me.

228
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:03.934
Get back in the
fucking house... No. No!

229
00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.401
- Get back in there!
- Leave me alone!

230
00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:07.470
You're acting like
a crazy woman!

231
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.239
- Fuck you!
- Leah...

232
00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:11.199
Leah, my sweet baby girl.

233
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:12.276
Don't touch her!

234
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.468
I didn't touch her!
I didn't touch her!

235
00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:45.927
No chocolate today?

236
00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:48.529
Mom, your sugar level
is through the roof.

237
00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:49.931
Fuck my sugar level.

238
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.934
How is it possible that
a number has power over me?

239
00:23:53.134 --> 00:23:54.735
The number doesn't
have power over you...

240
00:23:55.102 --> 00:23:57.571
But your doctor should
though. Fuck my doctor too.

241
00:23:57.605 --> 00:23:58.906
Beautiful, Mom!

242
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.875
What's life without its
pleasures?

243
00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:03.544
Coming from a presbyterian,
apparently a nightmare.

244
00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:04.444
Exactly!

245
00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:07.114
And leave the church out of
this.

246
00:24:07.214 --> 00:24:09.550
I've been trying for years but
you won't let me.

247
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:12.029
Where's all this
bitterness coming from?

248
00:24:12.053 --> 00:24:13.854
What's wrong with Jesus
all of a sudden?

249
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:15.957
Nothing Mom. It was a joke.

250
00:24:17.425 --> 00:24:19.794
I go to church.
When I have time.

251
00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:22.263
And apparently
you don't want to.

252
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.067
I did my best, you know?

253
00:24:26.499 --> 00:24:29.637
I gave you an education.
I gave you Faith...

254
00:24:29.837 --> 00:24:31.739
Where would you be
without your ethics?

255
00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:33.574
Okay, mom. I get it.

256
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:41.515
I saw Dad.

257
00:24:43.985 --> 00:24:44.952
Where?

258
00:24:45.252 --> 00:24:46.454
In front of my building...

259
00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:48.923
Just for a split second.

260
00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:51.125
- Did you talk to him?
- No...

261
00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:53.527
He disappeared.

262
00:24:54.996 --> 00:24:56.464
Does he still live in Roslyn?

263
00:24:56.664 --> 00:24:59.133
Don't you go and
do anything stupid.

264
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.001
Like what?

265
00:25:00.334 --> 00:25:01.335
Kill him?

266
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:04.138
At least I would have
the guts to do it.

267
00:25:05.106 --> 00:25:07.174
His wife is not yours to take.

268
00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:08.109
Are you kidding me?

269
00:25:08.309 --> 00:25:10.678
If anybody had the right to take
his life it would be me.

270
00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:13.180
Not you. Not God.

271
00:25:13.781 --> 00:25:14.615
Me.

272
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:32.066
I love you, Mom.

273
00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:40.509
I won't forget the
chocolates tomorrow.

274
00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:42.710
Good.

275
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.024
Good morning, Mike.

276
00:25:57.191 --> 00:25:59.336
Yes, the investigation
continues...

277
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.139
After this morning's
NYPD press conference...

278
00:26:02.163 --> 00:26:05.332
...the motives behind this
vicious murder are still unclear...

279
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:07.544
Father Charles was a
pillar in his community...

280
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:09.570
...and a beloved leader
in his congregation.

281
00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:13.574
A mass in his honor will take
place this Sunday at Saint John's.

282
00:26:17.378 --> 00:26:19.280
Do you believe in coincidence?

283
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.048
What do you mean?

284
00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:23.427
I saw my father yesterday...

285
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:24.952
Right outside of our building.

286
00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:26.987
I haven't seen him in years...

287
00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:28.923
And then I guess I...

288
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.425
I met this man on the subway...

289
00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.460
Met?

290
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.564
He made me... feel something.

291
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.265
What are you talking about?

292
00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:40.801
Do you believe that
everything happens for a reason?

293
00:26:42.036 --> 00:26:43.904
I think that everything happens

294
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:45.406
Period.

295
00:26:45.706 --> 00:26:48.309
Then we give it a reason that's
relevant for us.

296
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.045
Everything's a coincidence.

297
00:26:51.112 --> 00:26:53.690
Everything that happens before
what you think is a coincidence...

298
00:26:53.714 --> 00:26:55.749
...has led you to that
particular moment.

299
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.529
If nothing had happened before
that had...

300
00:26:58.553 --> 00:27:00.921
...the coincident would've never
happened either.

301
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:04.792
Therefore, everything's a
coincidence.

302
00:27:05.594 --> 00:27:07.161
Holly shit.

303
00:27:07.761 --> 00:27:11.098
It's just random events that we
all make especial for ourselves.

304
00:27:11.832 --> 00:27:15.069
Well, look at little Aristotle
right next to me.

305
00:27:15.636 --> 00:27:17.938
We're self-center
know-it-all primates...

306
00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:19.773
What can I say?

307
00:27:24.411 --> 00:27:25.346
What?

308
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:30.317
I miss this... us.

309
00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:33.354
Matt.

310
00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:35.756
I wish we could do this more
often.

311
00:27:39.528 --> 00:27:41.095
Let's go back to work.

312
00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:45.933
Yeah.

313
00:28:26.006 --> 00:28:27.509
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

314
00:28:27.708 --> 00:28:28.842
Come on.

315
00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:00.941
- DANEEN How is Lance?
- Still in the ICU...

316
00:29:01.342 --> 00:29:03.444
I don't want to lie to you but
it's not looking good.

317
00:29:05.513 --> 00:29:07.915
Aaron's gonna pay
for this. I promise.

318
00:29:07.948 --> 00:29:09.684
I know. I want him to pay too.

319
00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:11.752
Any updates on
the pencil pushers?

320
00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:13.722
No. How about you?

321
00:29:13.887 --> 00:29:16.423
I think I got something
but it's too soon to tell yet.

322
00:29:17.057 --> 00:29:17.891
You got a lead?

323
00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:19.426
I'll let you know
what it takes me...

324
00:29:19.527 --> 00:29:21.563
Call me if there's any
change with Lance.

325
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:23.063
- Daneen.
- What?

326
00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:25.966
We ran it again.

327
00:29:27.702 --> 00:29:28.769
And?

328
00:29:29.436 --> 00:29:30.804
Same result.

329
00:29:31.573 --> 00:29:33.274
You did it, my friend.

330
00:29:33.708 --> 00:29:35.042
We all did it.

331
00:29:35.075 --> 00:29:36.810
No. We followed you.
You did this.

332
00:29:38.045 --> 00:29:40.649
Get used to be known as
the woman who killed god.

333
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:42.983
God killer.

334
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.719
It's got a nice ring to
it, doesn't it?

335
00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:46.086
I guess it does.

336
00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:48.922
The Nobel Prize isn't going to be
big enough for you, Doctor Belman.

337
00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:51.091
I'm afraid of
the world that's coming...

338
00:29:51.292 --> 00:29:52.393
People are not...

339
00:29:53.994 --> 00:29:56.765
"We" are not ready
to go on supervised...

340
00:29:57.264 --> 00:30:00.735
Anyway... None of this will
matter if I can't stop Aaron.

341
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:02.245
One thing at a time, Daneen...

342
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:03.505
We don't have to do all at once.

343
00:30:03.672 --> 00:30:05.439
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

344
00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:01.895
Don't turn...
I said, don't turn.

345
00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:04.131
I have a gun.

346
00:31:04.532 --> 00:31:07.234
See that alley? Let's go.

347
00:31:31.024 --> 00:31:32.326
How about you, Father James?

348
00:31:35.663 --> 00:31:37.998
Do you know what
the meaning of life is?

349
00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:20.642
How about you, Father James?

350
00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:23.711
Do you know what
the meaning of life is?

351
00:32:26.915 --> 00:32:28.315
Do you even have a gun?

352
00:32:28.415 --> 00:32:29.751
On your knees. Now.

353
00:32:33.621 --> 00:32:34.789
Are you gonna kill me?

354
00:32:34.823 --> 00:32:36.791
Leah Thompson. Where is she?

355
00:32:37.157 --> 00:32:38.459
I don't know where she is.

356
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.160
What time does she come to work?

357
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.962
She doesn't come in
to work every day.

358
00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:43.430
Where does she live?

359
00:32:43.565 --> 00:32:45.241
I don't know where she lives.
Somewhere in Brooklyn, I think.

360
00:32:45.265 --> 00:32:46.166
Brooklyn is big.

361
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.736
I just told you. I
don't know! Shoosh!

362
00:32:49.236 --> 00:32:50.572
All right...

363
00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:54.576
Her mother.

364
00:32:55.008 --> 00:32:55.944
What about her?

365
00:32:56.009 --> 00:32:57.110
She's in a home.

366
00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:57.745
Where?

367
00:32:58.078 --> 00:33:00.314
Let me think...
It's... Town Park.

368
00:33:00.515 --> 00:33:01.114
Brooklyn too?

369
00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:01.916
Village Park!

370
00:33:02.115 --> 00:33:02.750
Where is it?

371
00:33:02.817 --> 00:33:03.852
I don't know. I'm not sure.

372
00:33:04.017 --> 00:33:04.686
Think.

373
00:33:05.085 --> 00:33:06.329
I just told you. I don't
know where it is.

374
00:33:06.353 --> 00:33:07.287
Just fucking Google it!

375
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.772
Don't turn.

376
00:34:11.318 --> 00:34:11.920
Hey.

377
00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:12.997
You said that there's no...

378
00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:14.656
...such thing as coincidence,
right?

379
00:34:14.722 --> 00:34:16.466
That nothing happens for a
reason?

380
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.190
Well, guess what?

381
00:34:17.725 --> 00:34:18.325
What?

382
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.004
Remember that guy
from the subway?

383
00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:20.595
Yeah.

384
00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:22.195
I followed him.

385
00:34:23.497 --> 00:34:24.566
How did you find him?

386
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.401
Check your phone.

387
00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:29.837
How about you, Father James?

388
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.873
You know what the
meaning of life is?

389
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.210
Christ. How the name of
God did you get this...

390
00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:38.245
I know how to find him.

391
00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:41.015
How? Do you know him?

392
00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:43.359
I don't know his name but...

393
00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:45.352
I know where he lives.

394
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.621
You gotta call the cops.

395
00:34:46.854 --> 00:34:47.354
Not yet.

396
00:34:47.689 --> 00:34:49.057
Why not? What do you want to do?

397
00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:52.603
I want some air time tomorrow.

398
00:34:52.627 --> 00:34:54.227
And then we can call the cops.

399
00:34:55.395 --> 00:34:56.931
You out of your fucking mind?

400
00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:58.066
Is that a yes?

401
00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:00.467
Sure. You got it.

402
00:35:00.602 --> 00:35:03.037
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow.

403
00:35:03.303 --> 00:35:03.938
Leah.

404
00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:05.439
What?

405
00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:07.274
There's somebody
looking for you.

406
00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:08.876
What do you mean somebody's
looking for me?

407
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.045
A woman. She stopped me in
the middle of the street and...

408
00:35:11.244 --> 00:35:13.146
...took me to an alley at
gunpoint.

409
00:35:13.748 --> 00:35:14.381
Are you okay?

410
00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:15.425
She was asking me questions...

411
00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:16.316
...about where you lived...

412
00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:18.653
She definitely knows
where you work.

413
00:35:19.053 --> 00:35:19.821
Who is she?

414
00:35:20.088 --> 00:35:22.090
I don't know.
I couldn't see her face.

415
00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:23.558
What did you tell her?

416
00:35:23.758 --> 00:35:25.560
Nothing. I don't even
know where you live.

417
00:35:26.628 --> 00:35:27.829
Just be careful, okay?

418
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.399
Yeah... I will.

419
00:35:36.136 --> 00:35:39.507
First it was Father Charles,
last night Father James.

420
00:35:40.173 --> 00:35:43.487
The importance of this footage is
not merely journalistic or informative...

421
00:35:43.511 --> 00:35:44.912
It goes beyond that...

422
00:35:45.178 --> 00:35:46.814
It's an attack on faith itself.

423
00:35:47.115 --> 00:35:49.282
Viewer discretion is advised.

424
00:36:40.668 --> 00:36:41.869
I need to talk to her.

425
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.871
Who are you?

426
00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:45.873
Alone.

427
00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:54.082
She's all yours.

428
00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:02.924
It's nice out, right?

429
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:09.496
Better out that in those torture
chambers they have me in.

430
00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:11.733
You don't seem tortured.

431
00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:17.081
I met a lawyer once who said
that the national sport of America...

432
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:19.348
...isn't baseball.
It's litigation.

433
00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:20.884
That's bullshit...

434
00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:22.342
It's complaining.

435
00:37:26.948 --> 00:37:29.117
Do you live around here?

436
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:31.853
I actually came to talk to you.

437
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.420
To me?

438
00:37:33.521 --> 00:37:35.790
What business can you possibly
have with me?

439
00:37:35.857 --> 00:37:37.959
I work with your daughter. Leah.

440
00:37:40.027 --> 00:37:41.562
At... at the firm?

441
00:37:42.362 --> 00:37:43.931
At the network but nice try.

442
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:45.900
Just making sure.

443
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:50.872
Leah actually brings me these
chocolates every week.

444
00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.584
I keep telling her to bring
more...

445
00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:55.219
...cause they'll never last a
week...

446
00:37:55.243 --> 00:37:58.746
...but she says that's too much
chocolate.

447
00:37:59.947 --> 00:38:02.382
There's no such a thing
as too much chocolate.

448
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.316
Exactly!

449
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:06.954
Now she wants to bring
me some sugar-free crap.

450
00:38:08.823 --> 00:38:10.323
This is so good.

451
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:12.459
Yeah... Fuck yeah.

452
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.327
I need to get me some of these.

453
00:38:15.263 --> 00:38:17.131
They make them in Brooklyn...

454
00:38:18.099 --> 00:38:19.399
Red Hook Treats...

455
00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.002
It's uh...

456
00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:30.144
It's a block from my
daughter's apartment...

457
00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:33.948
You said you needed
to talk to me. What about?

458
00:38:35.783 --> 00:38:36.951
Those chocolates.

459
00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:39.954
Leah always refuses to tell me
where she gets them.

460
00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:42.290
Well... now you know.

461
00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:47.261
Thank you... for sharing
that information with me.

462
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:48.696
Sure.

463
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.265
Gotta enjoy life while you can,
darling.

464
00:38:51.532 --> 00:38:52.834
I sure will.

465
00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:58.539
Come and visit.

466
00:38:58.639 --> 00:38:59.941
You know where to find me.

467
00:39:19.794 --> 00:39:20.728
Hello?

468
00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:22.663
USPS.

469
00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:32.139
I believe it's time
we accept the results.

470
00:39:32.206 --> 00:39:33.207
Fuck your results!

471
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:35.351
What makes you think
I'm not feeling the same way?

472
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:36.553
Cause you don't
have any fucking faith...

473
00:39:36.577 --> 00:39:37.855
...you just want to
destroy everything.

474
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:39.323
Higher power that
supervises everything...

475
00:39:39.347 --> 00:39:40.891
How could you possibly
know how I feel?

476
00:39:40.915 --> 00:39:41.916
I want answers...

477
00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:44.585
- Some answer you found.
- The truth hurts.

478
00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:09.543
I want to talk to you.

479
00:40:09.744 --> 00:40:10.745
About what?

480
00:40:11.612 --> 00:40:12.113
That.

481
00:40:12.246 --> 00:40:13.347
I'm not for hire.

482
00:40:13.547 --> 00:40:15.049
I wasn't gonna pay you anyway.

483
00:40:16.017 --> 00:40:17.184
I know what you're doing.

484
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.352
You do?

485
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.721
Sit down.

486
00:40:22.356 --> 00:40:23.391
Red Hook Treats.

487
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:25.026
Hey. This is Leah Thompson.

488
00:40:25.293 --> 00:40:27.271
I buy chocolates from you pretty
much every week.

489
00:40:27.295 --> 00:40:28.763
My mom loves them.

490
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.400
Hey. Yes, of course. Leah.
How can I help you today?

491
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.344
I won't be able to just stop by.

492
00:40:34.368 --> 00:40:36.404
Could you send the over to my
place?

493
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:38.739
Sure. The usual?

494
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.207
Yes, that'll be great.

495
00:40:40.473 --> 00:40:41.309
Awesome.

496
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:43.778
When do you think
it'll be ready?

497
00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:47.982
Give us like 25
minutes? Maybe 30. Tops.

498
00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:49.482
Cool. Thank you so much.

499
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.619
Tell Angelina I say 'hi'.

500
00:40:52.053 --> 00:40:53.220
I sure will.

501
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:55.656
Thank you. Have a good one.

502
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.924
You too.

503
00:40:57.758 --> 00:41:00.871
Are you some sort of crazy
atheist?

504
00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:03.564
Or is this some sort of
heathen revenge or something?

505
00:41:03.664 --> 00:41:06.400
I'd say everybody is an atheist
when it comes to other religions.

506
00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:08.069
So you are an atheist.

507
00:41:08.602 --> 00:41:10.171
I was a believer.

508
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.807
But it turns out God is
irrelevant.

509
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.051
And hope is irrelevant.

510
00:41:14.075 --> 00:41:15.786
And anybody who tells you
anything different...

511
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.511
...is utterly and irredeemably
full of shit.

512
00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:18.478
But why kill them?

513
00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:19.814
Because nothing makes!

514
00:41:19.847 --> 00:41:21.449
But you're too stupid
to understand that.

515
00:41:21.515 --> 00:41:22.249
Excuse me?

516
00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:23.459
You're even smart enough...

517
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:24.652
...to know how stupid
you really are.

518
00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:25.786
Fuck you!

519
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:30.300
You want me to bash
your daddy's brains in...

520
00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:32.259
...but you can't
take a little shit?

521
00:41:32.492 --> 00:41:34.295
You're not ready for this.

522
00:41:34.762 --> 00:41:36.630
My father fits the profile.

523
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:40.201
He's a pastor. He could be added
to your list.

524
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:41.535
What list?

525
00:41:41.635 --> 00:41:44.138
Your kill list.
Cut the shit out.

526
00:41:44.305 --> 00:41:47.108
If you want him dead so bad
why don't you kill him yourself?

527
00:41:48.509 --> 00:41:49.710
I don't have the balls.

528
00:41:49.777 --> 00:41:51.755
You should definitely
not be saying that...

529
00:41:51.779 --> 00:41:53.948
...to someone you're threatening
with a knife.

530
00:41:57.184 --> 00:41:59.120
I was seven when he...

531
00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:04.558
My mother got us out of that
house.

532
00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:06.727
But he followed us out.

533
00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.564
I thought he was
gonna kill us...

534
00:42:11.799 --> 00:42:13.968
But my mother stabbed him.

535
00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:16.904
He fell on the ground.
He was bleeding

536
00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:20.374
But he didn't die.

537
00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:23.577
That son of a bitch didn't die.

538
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:29.016
Touching.

539
00:42:30.751 --> 00:42:32.686
All right|

540
00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.857
You either help me or I turn you
to the cops.

541
00:42:40.061 --> 00:42:42.063
You know what
happen to rats, right?

542
00:42:42.329 --> 00:42:43.431
Stop!

543
00:42:43.898 --> 00:42:44.899
I said stop!

544
00:42:48.169 --> 00:42:51.572
Killing that motherfucker will
make no difference for you.

545
00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:53.707
It's not gonna change
the world or anything.

546
00:42:53.874 --> 00:42:56.186
Wrong. The world is
always changing.

547
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.579
The ones who can't change it
think it's always the same.

548
00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:00.448
Are you changing it?

549
00:43:01.215 --> 00:43:03.918
It's gonna change in ways
you cannot possibly imagine.

550
00:43:04.085 --> 00:43:06.587
I think you give too much
credit to those priests.

551
00:43:06.687 --> 00:43:08.722
Don't believe me. I don't care.

552
00:43:08.789 --> 00:43:09.890
I'll believe it when I see it.

553
00:43:09.957 --> 00:43:12.561
By then it'll be too
late. You'll just know.

554
00:43:14.862 --> 00:43:15.796
Okay.

555
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.432
I get it.

556
00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:21.536
You're crazy.

557
00:43:26.207 --> 00:43:27.141
I'll do it.

558
00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:29.610
What?

559
00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:32.413
I'll add him to my list.

560
00:43:34.048 --> 00:43:36.784
If we do this
there's no going back.

561
00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:40.054
No hesitation. No cold feet.

562
00:43:40.754 --> 00:43:42.591
No bullshit.

563
00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:50.464
Tell me why I shouldn't just
kill you right now instead of him.

564
00:43:53.134 --> 00:43:55.402
I just need to know
that he's dead.

565
00:43:56.337 --> 00:44:00.074
Kill him first and then you can
do whatever you want with me.

566
00:44:20.629 --> 00:44:23.697
If you want him dead so bad
why don't you kill him yourself?

567
00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:26.800
I don't have the balls.

568
00:44:28.202 --> 00:44:29.970
You're not ready for this.

569
00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.815
Thank you, Phil.

570
00:44:55.396 --> 00:44:57.998
- Morning.
- Morning.

571
00:44:58.032 --> 00:44:59.500
You look like shit!

572
00:44:59.668 --> 00:45:01.636
The bags under your eyes!

573
00:45:06.675 --> 00:45:09.476
Phil said he saw
you on the news.

574
00:45:10.545 --> 00:45:11.245
Really?

575
00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:14.048
He told me you were talking
about a murderer.

576
00:45:14.248 --> 00:45:16.350
Some guy who's killing
priests or something.

577
00:45:16.685 --> 00:45:18.687
Yep... That's right.

578
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:20.655
Killing priests.

579
00:45:21.055 --> 00:45:22.691
What is this?

580
00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:25.560
The Spanish Civil War all over
again?

581
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.063
This world has really
lost its course.

582
00:45:36.437 --> 00:45:38.172
I've seen Dad.

583
00:45:39.006 --> 00:45:41.509
Yeah, you already told me this.

584
00:45:43.744 --> 00:45:45.379
- Did you...?
- What?

585
00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:46.780
How could you?

586
00:45:46.947 --> 00:45:48.015
What?

587
00:45:48.115 --> 00:45:50.417
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

588
00:45:51.051 --> 00:45:52.554
You've ruined everything!

589
00:45:52.687 --> 00:45:54.255
Angelina you have to calm down.

590
00:45:54.288 --> 00:45:56.090
- You disgust me!
- Angelina...

591
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.292
I told you not to do
it. Not to do it!

592
00:45:58.425 --> 00:46:00.729
What kind of stupid cunt are
you?

593
00:46:00.794 --> 00:46:02.029
Mom!

594
00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:09.470
Angelina...

595
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:11.305
...calm down.

596
00:46:45.607 --> 00:46:46.775
Hey, Frank.

597
00:46:47.274 --> 00:46:49.009
- Hey, Danny.
- How are you doing?

598
00:47:12.634 --> 00:47:14.001
You want to go in?

599
00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:16.170
Don't worry. I'm not in a rush.

600
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.838
You're not from
New York, are you?

601
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:19.541
No. Why?

602
00:47:19.973 --> 00:47:21.975
You said you're not in a rush.

603
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:24.211
- You got me there.
- And you accent?

604
00:47:24.345 --> 00:47:25.346
Where's that from?

605
00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:28.182
I'm a time traveler
from the future.

606
00:47:36.056 --> 00:47:37.891
Israel?

607
00:47:38.058 --> 00:47:39.193
Sure.

608
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.030
All right.

609
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:44.532
All right. Load and clear,
ma'am.

610
00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:46.367
You have a nice day.

611
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.981
No knife today?

612
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.584
Can I come in?

613
00:49:09.918 --> 00:49:10.785
No.

614
00:49:12.419 --> 00:49:13.420
Please.

615
00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:21.930
Thank you.

616
00:49:29.336 --> 00:49:30.672
Are you drunk?

617
00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:33.908
Not as much as I should be.

618
00:49:33.974 --> 00:49:35.844
You can't stay.

619
00:49:36.578 --> 00:49:38.780
What would make you think that I
want to?

620
00:49:38.847 --> 00:49:39.681
You should go home.

621
00:49:40.247 --> 00:49:43.150
And you should show a little
fucking empathy for a change.

622
00:49:58.265 --> 00:50:01.679
Did you know that the
chemicals that make up...

623
00:50:01.703 --> 00:50:05.038
...the human body are worth
$3,000 in the market?

624
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:07.976
That's it.

625
00:50:08.475 --> 00:50:12.145
Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen... All
that crap.

626
00:50:12.479 --> 00:50:14.147
Three thousand bucks.

627
00:50:15.482 --> 00:50:18.653
We're only what we have up here.

628
00:50:20.622 --> 00:50:22.557
And she's lost her mind.

629
00:50:23.558 --> 00:50:26.460
She is fucking senile.

630
00:50:28.663 --> 00:50:30.230
Do you know what that means?

631
00:50:31.164 --> 00:50:33.233
No, I don't know what
that means.

632
00:50:33.367 --> 00:50:36.504
That means that my dear
mother is worth only $3,000.

633
00:50:36.671 --> 00:50:39.473
Fucking Midtown rent at best.

634
00:50:57.859 --> 00:51:00.562
You know memories
are what make us?

635
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:03.363
They're priceless.

636
00:51:18.245 --> 00:51:19.446
What are you doing?

637
00:51:21.248 --> 00:51:23.952
It's rude to let me drink alone,
dickhead.

638
00:51:29.557 --> 00:51:30.558
To me.

639
00:51:32.192 --> 00:51:33.193
What the hell.

640
00:51:43.403 --> 00:51:46.273
When was the last time
that you had a good fuck?

641
00:52:55.308 --> 00:52:56.944
Your phone is off.

642
00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:00.323
It is? Sorry...

643
00:53:00.347 --> 00:53:03.183
I have a lot on my mind.

644
00:53:08.856 --> 00:53:10.024
I'm sorry, Leah.

645
00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:14.562
Your mother passed away early
this morning.

646
00:53:16.296 --> 00:53:19.399
We came in to wake her up for
her gym class...

647
00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:23.037
...that's when we found her.

648
00:53:26.074 --> 00:53:28.643
It was... it was very peaceful.

649
00:53:36.918 --> 00:53:38.351
Thank you, Phil.

650
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.189
You're always really
great to her.

651
00:53:44.192 --> 00:53:45.560
She really deserved it.

652
00:53:47.227 --> 00:53:48.029
Yeah.

653
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.698
Yeah, she did.

654
00:54:01.542 --> 00:54:02.910
You want these?

655
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:06.114
They're her favorite.

656
00:54:06.214 --> 00:54:07.515
I know.

657
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.420
Thanks.

658
00:54:37.277 --> 00:54:38.546
Any update, doc?

659
00:54:41.616 --> 00:54:42.884
All right...

660
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:43.985
Thanks.

661
00:54:44.252 --> 00:54:45.620
Shit.

662
00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:54.738
He's killing his old teachers...

663
00:54:54.762 --> 00:54:56.774
Some sort of revenge against
those who gave him Faith.

664
00:54:56.798 --> 00:54:58.933
First was father Charles and the
Father James...

665
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.334
We need to figure out
who's going to be next.

666
00:55:01.434 --> 00:55:02.813
- Daneen, listen...
- I have a lead...

667
00:55:02.837 --> 00:55:05.949
There is this reporter who
filmed his second murder.

668
00:55:05.973 --> 00:55:08.218
I'm pretty sure sh'e going to
try to make contact with him...

669
00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:09.418
...or follow him or something.

670
00:55:09.442 --> 00:55:11.411
She's key to finding him.

671
00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:13.014
I'm at her apartment right now.

672
00:55:13.114 --> 00:55:15.583
Daneen, listen. I got
bad news about Lance.

673
00:55:16.184 --> 00:55:18.653
He didn't make it. I'm sorry.

674
00:55:20.188 --> 00:55:22.465
We tried everything we could...

675
00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:24.525
I'm really, really sorry.

676
00:55:28.529 --> 00:55:30.274
Thank you for the update.

677
00:55:30.298 --> 00:55:32.133
I'll keep you posted if anything
comes up.

678
00:55:32.934 --> 00:55:34.602
Just be careful out there, okay?

679
00:55:36.336 --> 00:55:37.772
I will.

680
00:56:47.174 --> 00:56:48.876
I'm ready.

681
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.256
Why did you say that
hope is irrelevant?

682
00:57:04.191 --> 00:57:05.793
Just trying to
make conversation.

683
00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:10.097
I'm nervous. That's all.

684
00:57:10.398 --> 00:57:12.199
So keep it to yourself.

685
00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:23.277
They're charlatans. Con men.

686
00:57:24.078 --> 00:57:26.047
And they deserve
to die because of it?

687
00:57:26.147 --> 00:57:29.250
It's not about them. It's about
the damage they're causing.

688
00:57:32.153 --> 00:57:34.588
How is giving hope to
people causing damage?

689
00:57:34.755 --> 00:57:36.757
Lies cause damage.

690
00:57:39.393 --> 00:57:42.471
When you spend your whole life believing
something that's then proven to be false...

691
00:57:42.495 --> 00:57:45.399
...you either ignore the evidence
or you can do something about it.

692
00:57:50.137 --> 00:57:52.273
So you decided to do
something about it.

693
00:57:53.174 --> 00:57:54.675
Look.

694
00:57:55.409 --> 00:57:57.587
I can prove with no margin of
error...

695
00:57:57.611 --> 00:58:01.725
...that there's no god, no
eternity, no logic to our suffering.

696
00:58:01.749 --> 00:58:03.584
Nothing makes sense.

697
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.732
It's that why you asked him
what the meaning of life was?

698
00:58:08.756 --> 00:58:12.093
Some sort of sadistic final
touch or something?

699
00:58:12.126 --> 00:58:13.861
I'm not enjoying this.

700
00:58:14.428 --> 00:58:16.430
Just has to be done.

701
00:58:16.764 --> 00:58:18.699
For the greater good.

702
00:58:28.542 --> 00:58:29.844
What are you doing?

703
00:58:30.044 --> 00:58:31.445
Just keep a lookout, okay?

704
00:58:33.781 --> 00:58:35.149
I thought you had a car.

705
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:37.351
I have them all.

706
00:59:02.877 --> 00:59:03.978
There.

707
00:59:10.918 --> 00:59:12.486
Any security systems?

708
00:59:15.656 --> 00:59:17.725
An alarm. Maybe.

709
00:59:18.859 --> 00:59:20.494
Maybe?

710
00:59:20.995 --> 00:59:22.763
I think that's what we had...

711
00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.433
I was seven... I don't
really remember.

712
00:59:25.766 --> 00:59:27.501
Well, it isn't much.

713
00:59:27.935 --> 00:59:29.837
Could've put a little more
thought into this plan.

714
00:59:29.937 --> 00:59:31.038
I don't have a plan.

715
00:59:31.405 --> 00:59:32.541
Wonderful.

716
00:59:32.606 --> 00:59:34.341
Remember, no cold feet.

717
00:59:34.442 --> 00:59:35.843
Don't push it.

718
00:59:38.946 --> 00:59:41.248
If he's in the alarm's
gonna be off.

719
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.051
Does he live alone? New
wife? Children?

720
00:59:44.852 --> 00:59:47.421
- No.
- Guns?

721
00:59:48.022 --> 00:59:51.025
Probably. I think a handgun.

722
00:59:51.358 --> 00:59:52.726
Probably upstairs.

723
00:59:54.361 --> 00:59:55.930
Probably, probably.

724
00:59:58.599 --> 01:00:01.435
Okay. Go ring the doorbell.

725
01:00:01.536 --> 01:00:02.736
Me?

726
01:00:42.676 --> 01:00:43.811
Who's there?

727
01:00:45.813 --> 01:00:46.780
What do you want?

728
01:00:50.784 --> 01:00:51.919
It's me.

729
01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:54.255
Yeah... Me who?

730
01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:57.491
Your daughter.

731
01:00:58.292 --> 01:00:59.460
Leah.

732
01:01:04.932 --> 01:01:05.933
It's really you.

733
01:01:12.039 --> 01:01:14.475
My God, what are you doing here?

734
01:01:18.547 --> 01:01:20.781
Jesus Christ, you're a woman
now.

735
01:01:24.852 --> 01:01:26.320
How long has it been?

736
01:02:24.778 --> 01:02:26.447
Wait! Wait!

737
01:02:28.882 --> 01:02:29.950
Not yet.

738
01:02:46.735 --> 01:02:47.801
Not a good idea.

739
01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:49.103
Please, don't.

740
01:02:50.204 --> 01:02:54.308
I just wanna know that you
know why this is happening to you.

741
01:02:54.408 --> 01:02:55.610
Please, Leah, don't do this.

742
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:57.911
Yo do know why this is
happening, don't you?

743
01:02:58.112 --> 01:02:59.813
Everything I did was for you.

744
01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:02.584
- I did all for you.
- Oh, you did?

745
01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:04.451
Your mother's got it all wrong.

746
01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:05.587
She's got it all wrong.

747
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.920
What did she get wrong?

748
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.592
She...

749
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.728
She thought she saw us.

750
01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:16.397
Me.

751
01:03:17.164 --> 01:03:18.165
But it wasn't true.

752
01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:19.900
Just fucking admit it!

753
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:23.003
Just fucking have the
decency to admit it!

754
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.749
I swear to God it
wasn't true, Leah.

755
01:03:24.773 --> 01:03:25.906
I never touched you!

756
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:31.111
I never laid a hand on you.

757
01:03:36.183 --> 01:03:37.985
If you never did anything...

758
01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:43.957
...then why do I still feel you
every single night?

759
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:47.428
I loved you so much.

760
01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:50.497
I loved you so much.

761
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.303
I still do, my sweet baby girl.

762
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.411
Where to?

763
01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:39.913
What?

764
01:04:40.214 --> 01:04:41.982
Where do you want me
to drop you off?

765
01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:46.320
At my place.

766
01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:48.222
Address?

767
01:06:02.963 --> 01:06:04.407
You ever hear from that woman?

768
01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:05.600
The one with the gun?

769
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:08.335
No... Besides, I haven't
been home in a couple of days.

770
01:06:08.469 --> 01:06:09.470
Where have you stayed?

771
01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:15.409
With a friend.

772
01:06:15.743 --> 01:06:17.010
A girlfriend.

773
01:06:20.748 --> 01:06:22.182
You should call the police.

774
01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:23.952
Yeah, I will.

775
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:31.124
All of this has to
mean something, right?

776
01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:35.964
Life has to mean something.

777
01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:41.502
I mean, we can't just be born
and the work and then die.

778
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.540
That's what most
people do anyways.

779
01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:51.345
No. My mother saved me.

780
01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:53.213
That has to mean something.

781
01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:02.198
All my life I've been
driven by this anger...

782
01:07:02.222 --> 01:07:04.726
...and this desire for revenge.

783
01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.663
Now that I had it, I...

784
01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:12.867
...I feel completely empty
inside.

785
01:07:13.902 --> 01:07:17.505
You've lost your purpose.
Your sense of direction.

786
01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:27.515
Yeah.

787
01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:29.316
I guess I have.

788
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.186
I'm a fucking nomad now.

789
01:07:54.441 --> 01:07:58.111
The meaning of life is the
one we give it ourselves.

790
01:07:59.112 --> 01:08:00.515
I'm sorry, Matt.

791
01:08:00.949 --> 01:08:02.282
It's all good.

792
01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:04.451
We don't choose to be loved.

793
01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:06.353
Otherwise we'd always choose
better.

794
01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:18.198
Call the police
about that woman.

795
01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:19.534
I said I will.

796
01:08:19.634 --> 01:08:21.268
Just let me worry
about you, okay?

797
01:08:21.468 --> 01:08:23.071
Okay, but I'm fine.

798
01:08:24.973 --> 01:08:25.940
Sure.

799
01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:28.876
When you really are...

800
01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:32.914
...you're not gonna miss any more
of my Saturday night dinner parties.

801
01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:53.635
Please, stay.

802
01:08:54.802 --> 01:08:57.605
I have something that
someone like you might find...

803
01:08:58.238 --> 01:08:59.406
...interesting.

804
01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:03.511
I'm Dr. Daneen Bellman.

805
01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:05.613
Leah Thompson.

806
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:08.281
But I feel that you
already knew that.

807
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.418
Are you a woman of faith?

808
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.123
No. I don't think so.

809
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:18.458
Good. That's gonna make
things much easier.

810
01:09:19.661 --> 01:09:23.430
What if I tell you I can
prove that God doesn't exist?

811
01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:25.700
Sure, but you can't.

812
01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:27.802
That's where you are wrong.

813
01:09:27.869 --> 01:09:29.537
I already have.

814
01:09:29.937 --> 01:09:31.371
- Scientifically?
- Yes.

815
01:09:31.438 --> 01:09:33.007
- Mathematically?
- Yes.

816
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.008
Bullshit.

817
01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:35.308
You don't have to believe me.

818
01:09:35.342 --> 01:09:36.878
Good, cause I don't.

819
01:09:48.122 --> 01:09:50.825
Daneen Bellman.

820
01:09:55.129 --> 01:09:56.731
You're kind of a big deal.

821
01:09:56.898 --> 01:09:57.899
I am.

822
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:01.869
And you served in the military.

823
01:10:03.705 --> 01:10:05.840
So there's no God or anything.

824
01:10:06.007 --> 01:10:07.407
Again, yes.

825
01:10:07.508 --> 01:10:09.010
Yeah, this is stupid.

826
01:10:09.309 --> 01:10:11.522
Stupind is not changing
your mind when...

827
01:10:11.546 --> 01:10:14.247
...you haven evidence that
challenges your believes.

828
01:10:14.347 --> 01:10:17.151
I'm gonna need hard evidence if you
want me to bring this to the network.

829
01:10:17.185 --> 01:10:18.986
I don't want you to
go to the network.

830
01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:20.922
Then what do you want? I mean...

831
01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:23.658
Sorry. I really don't
have time for this.

832
01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:26.160
Aaron was a member of my
lab team.

833
01:10:26.259 --> 01:10:28.529
He's a man of the cloth.
A man of faith.

834
01:10:30.198 --> 01:10:31.199
He's a priest?

835
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:35.603
And a very dangerous one.

836
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:39.049
Faith is an anti-virus.

837
01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.876
It's a firewall that protects us
and makes us feel good.

838
01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:43.945
It tells you exactly what you
want to hear.

839
01:10:44.579 --> 01:10:46.446
But it can also make
you lose your mind.

840
01:10:46.948 --> 01:10:49.550
The brain intakes the truth as
if it was a virus.

841
01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.953
Some people are immune,
others get sick.

842
01:10:52.587 --> 01:10:55.388
People are not ready
for the truth.

843
01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:58.258
The same way Aaron wasn't.

844
01:10:58.458 --> 01:11:01.763
So you want to find Aaron to
make him stop spreading the truth.

845
01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:04.866
I just don't want
anybody else to die.

846
01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:08.202
The truth will inevitably come
to light.

847
01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:10.972
But first we need to prepare
Humanity for it.

848
01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:12.248
But you know the truth.

849
01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:14.184
And if you say that the truth
makes everyone insane, then...

850
01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.375
...why aren't you crazy?

851
01:11:19.547 --> 01:11:21.215
What makes you think I'm not?

852
01:11:27.054 --> 01:11:28.222
Stay away from me.

853
01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.466
I don't have time for stalkers.

854
01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:42.770
I wanted to see you.

855
01:11:42.837 --> 01:11:43.838
What for?

856
01:11:45.405 --> 01:11:47.074
Can I use your bathroom?

857
01:11:56.617 --> 01:11:58.019
You know where it is.

858
01:12:06.627 --> 01:12:08.129
Okay. Now you need to leave.

859
01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:09.263
- Why?
- Look...

860
01:12:09.429 --> 01:12:11.642
You wanted your father out of
the picture. You got it.

861
01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.243
You wanted a good
fuck. You got it.

862
01:12:13.267 --> 01:12:14.669
What more do you want from me?

863
01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:16.537
My father is dead.

864
01:12:16.671 --> 01:12:19.372
And I literally feel no relief
at all.

865
01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:22.844
You're the only person that I
can talk to about this.

866
01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:24.444
How is this my problem?

867
01:12:24.512 --> 01:12:26.113
Because you're a priest!

868
01:12:27.548 --> 01:12:30.661
I was at the park today
and a woman came up to me...

869
01:12:30.685 --> 01:12:32.863
...and said that you
worked with her on some...

870
01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.822
sort of experiment or something?

871
01:12:34.889 --> 01:12:36.290
Okay, you need to leave now.

872
01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:37.658
Why? Because she
could've followed you.

873
01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:39.293
She didn't. How the
fuck do you know?

874
01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:41.028
Because she was still in
the park bench when I left.

875
01:12:41.128 --> 01:12:42.830
And people on park
benches can't get up and walk?

876
01:12:42.897 --> 01:12:44.508
- I don't know!
- Look, you don't know...

877
01:12:44.532 --> 01:12:46.143
...what's a stake here.
I can't take any risks.

878
01:12:46.167 --> 01:12:47.635
You need to leave now.

879
01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.680
My life is literally
falling apart...

880
01:12:49.704 --> 01:12:52.306
...and I can't make much
sense out of anything anymore.

881
01:12:52.405 --> 01:12:53.984
Well having a senseless
life is ultimately...

882
01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:56.010
...everybody's fate. Why should
it be any different for you?

883
01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:58.012
My god you can be
an asshole sometimes.

884
01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:06.654
I think that our paths
have crossed for a reason.

885
01:13:06.754 --> 01:13:09.489
That's why you're just as
ignorant as everybody else.

886
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:10.224
No.

887
01:13:11.893 --> 01:13:16.364
You've made me feel things that
nobody has before.

888
01:13:16.697 --> 01:13:18.699
Us meeting wasn't random.

889
01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:20.409
I know that you feel it too...

890
01:13:20.433 --> 01:13:22.103
...because if you didn't feel it
then...

891
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:24.372
You would've left by now.

892
01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.377
I think that I'm stuck in your head
as much as you're stuck in mine.

893
01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:32.113
And that's fucking you up.

894
01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:35.349
Love is pointless.

895
01:13:35.516 --> 01:13:38.451
It might be... but it's real.

896
01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:42.924
On the ground.

897
01:13:44.025 --> 01:13:44.926
I'm not armed.

898
01:13:45.059 --> 01:13:46.761
I said on the ground now.

899
01:13:47.061 --> 01:13:48.262
You gonna shoot me?

900
01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.232
I'm trying not to.

901
01:13:52.432 --> 01:13:53.968
I'm not gonna stop.

902
01:13:54.368 --> 01:13:55.369
I know.

903
01:14:40.314 --> 01:14:42.116
Don't follow me.

904
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.805
Oh, my God! Come on.

905
01:15:13.214 --> 01:15:14.682
The world is always changing...

906
01:15:14.715 --> 01:15:16.550
It's gonna change in ways you
cannot possibly imagen.

907
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.185
Are you changing it?

908
01:15:20.221 --> 01:15:23.133
I can prove with no margin or error...
It turns out that God is irrelevant...

909
01:15:23.157 --> 01:15:25.659
- Nothing makes sense!
- I was a believer

910
01:15:30.364 --> 01:15:31.565
Where did he go?

911
01:15:31.699 --> 01:15:32.800
I don't know.

912
01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:34.502
Why didn't you go with him?

913
01:15:34.702 --> 01:15:37.071
You seem to need
more help than he did.

914
01:15:47.915 --> 01:15:50.060
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling 911.

915
01:15:50.084 --> 01:15:51.585
No. You need to
go to a hospital!

916
01:15:51.652 --> 01:15:53.154
He's gonna vanish again.

917
01:15:53.187 --> 01:15:54.889
I need to fix this mess.

918
01:15:55.256 --> 01:15:57.191
What are you
looking for? My gun.

919
01:15:57.425 --> 01:15:58.759
Are you gonna kill him?

920
01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:04.098
He took it.

921
01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:48.640
I want to report a
man with a gun.

922
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.824
I can't get you out
of my fucking head.

923
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.962
I can't get you out of
my fucking head either.

924
01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:10.599
Don't you try to sell me
that like it's a good thing.

925
01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:13.602
- But it is.
- It's not!

926
01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:16.470
It is.

927
01:17:17.838 --> 01:17:20.074
It gives you a purpose.

928
01:17:21.275 --> 01:17:24.445
It gives you a reason to wake up
in the morning.

929
01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:40.761
Go and live your life Leah.

930
01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:44.832
You still might find something
to be grateful for.

931
01:17:53.474 --> 01:17:58.279
I'd trade all my tomorrows...
for a single yesterday.

932
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.603
Next one's on you.

933
01:20:02.604 --> 01:20:04.104
Thank you.

934
01:20:07.676 --> 01:20:11.412
You know, that's it.
Everything happens for a reason.

935
01:20:11.445 --> 01:20:12.846
- Don't get me started.
- No, no, no.

936
01:20:12.946 --> 01:20:15.115
That's what I choose to believe.

937
01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:17.519
Even if it's total bullshit.

938
01:20:18.018 --> 01:20:19.987
That's what I choose to believe.

939
01:20:23.924 --> 01:20:25.292
Fair enough.

940
01:20:26.795 --> 01:20:29.296
Now all you got to do
is find that reason.

941
01:20:30.197 --> 01:20:32.199
Worth giving it a chance,
don't you think?

942
01:20:42.677 --> 01:20:44.445
I'm sorry I ratted you out.

943
01:20:48.783 --> 01:20:52.886
I honestly don't know what I would
do if I had a gun pointing at my head.

944
01:20:56.223 --> 01:20:58.459
You know you're going to be
changing ghosts, don't you?

945
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:00.961
Maybe.

946
01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:05.199
But I would trade
all of my yesterdays...

947
01:21:05.633 --> 01:21:08.502
For the dream of
a better tomorrow.

948
01:21:20.013 --> 01:21:21.081
So...

949
01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:24.218
Are you ready for a
dinner party this Saturday?

950
01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:36.598
I might be.
