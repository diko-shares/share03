Good morning, Mike.

NYPD press conference...

365
00:26:02.163 --> 00:26:05.332
...the motives behind this
vicious murder are still unclear...

366
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:07.544
LEAH: Father Charles was a
pillar in his community...

367
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:09.570
...and a beloved leader
in his congregation.

368
00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:13.574
A mass in his honor will take
place this Sunday at Saint John's.

371
00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:23.427
I saw my father yesterday...

372
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:24.952
Right outside of our building.

373
00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:26.987
I haven't seen him in years...

374
00:26:27.788 --> 00:26:28.923
And then I guess I...

375
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.425
I met this man on the subway...

00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.460
Met?

377
00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:35.564
He made me... feel something.

MATT: What are you talking
about?

379
00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:40.801
LEAH: Do you believe that
everything happens for a reason?

380
00:26:42.036 --> 00:26:43.904
I think that everything happens

381
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:45.406

00:26:45.706 --> 00:26:48.309

relevant for us.

Everything's a coincidence.

Everything that happens before
what you think is a coincidence...

...has led you to that
particular moment.

386
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.529
If nothing had happened before
that had...

387
00:26:58.553 --> 00:27:00.921
...the coincident would've never
happened either.

388
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:04.792
Therefore, everything's a
coincidence.

ANGELINA: Better out that in those
torture chambers they have me in.

538
00:37:09.997 --> 00:37:11.733
You don't seem tortured.

539
00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:17.081
I met a lawyer once who said
that the national sport of America...

540
00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:19.348
...isn't baseball.
It's litigation.

541
00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:20.884
That's bullshit...

542
00:37:20.908 --> 00:37:22.342
It's complaining.

543
00:37:26.948 --> 00:37:29.117
Do you live around here?

544
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:31.853
DANEEN: I actually came to talk
to you.

545
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.420
To me?

546
00:37:33.521 --> 00:37:35.790
What business can you possibly
have with me?

547
00:37:35.857 --> 00:37:37.959
DANEEN: I work with your
daughter. Leah.

548
00:37:40.027 --> 00:37:41.562
At... at the firm?

549
00:37:42.362 --> 00:37:43.931
DANEEN: At the network but nice
try.

550
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:45.900
ANGELINA: Just making sure.

551
00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:50.872
Leah actually brings me these
chocolates every week.

552
00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.584
I keep telling her to bring
more...

553
00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:55.219
...cause they'll never last a
week...

554
00:37:55.243 --> 00:37:58.746
...but she says that's too much
chocolate.

555
00:37:59.947 --> 00:38:02.382
DANEEN: There's no such a thing
as too much chocolate.

556
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.316
ANGELINA: Exactly!

557
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:06.954
Now she wants to bring
me some sugar-free crap.

558
00:38:08.823 --> 00:38:10.323
DANEEN: This is so good.

559
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:12.459
ANGELINA: Yeah... Fuck yeah.

560
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.327
DANEEN: I need to get me some of
these.

561
00:38:15.263 --> 00:38:17.131
They make them in Brooklyn...

562
00:38:18.099 --> 00:38:19.399
Red Hook Treats...

563
00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.002
It's uh...

564
00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:30.144
It's a block from my
daughter's apartment...

565
00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:33.948
You said you needed
to talk to me. What about?

566
00:38:35.783 --> 00:38:36.951
Those chocolates.

567
00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:39.954
Leah always refuses to tell me
where she gets them.

568
00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:42.290
Well... now you know.

569
00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:47.261
DANEEN: Thank you... for sharing
that information with me.

570
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:48.696
ANGELINA: Sure.

571
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.265
Gotta enjoy life while you can,
darling.

572
00:38:51.532 --> 00:38:52.834
I sure will.

573
00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:58.539
Come and visit.

574
00:38:58.639 --> 00:38:59.941
You know where to find me.

AARON: Fuck your results!

582
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:35.351
DANEEN: What makes you think
I'm not feeling the same way?

583
00:39:35.375 --> 00:39:36.553
AARON: Cause you don't
have any fucking faith...

584
00:39:36.577 --> 00:39:37.855
...you just want to
destroy everything.

585

DANEEN: Higher power that
supervises everything...

586
00:39:39.347 --> 00:39:40.891
AARON: How could you possibly
know how I feel?

587

DANEEN: I want answers...

AARON: About what?

593
00:40:11.612 --> 00:40:12.113
That.

594
00:40:12.246 --> 00:40:13.347
AARON: I'm not for hire.

595
00:40:13.547 --> 00:40:15.049
LEAH: I wasn't gonna pay you
anyway.

596
00:40:16.017 --> 00:40:17.184
I know what you're doing.

597
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.352
You do?

DANEEN: Hey. This is Leah
Thompson.

601
00:40:25.293 --> 00:40:27.271
I buy chocolates from you pretty
much every week.

602
00:40:27.295 --> 00:40:28.763
My mom loves them.

603
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.400
RECEPTIONIST: Hey. Yes, of
course. Leah. How can I help you today?

604
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.344
DANEEN: I won't be able
to just stop by.

605
00:40:34.368 --> 00:40:36.404
Could you send the over to my
place?

606
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:38.739
RECEPTIONIST: Sure. The usual?

607
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.207
DANEEN: Yes, that'll be great.

608
00:40:40.473 --> 00:40:41.309
RECEPTIONIST: Awesome.

609
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:43.778
DANEEN: When do you think
it'll be ready?

610
00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:47.982
RECEPTIONIST: Give us like 25
minutes? Maybe 30. Tops.

611
00:40:48.149 --> 00:40:49.482
DANEEN: Cool. Thank you so much.

612
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.619
RECEPTIONIST: Tell Angelina I
say 'hi'.

613
00:40:52.053 --> 00:40:53.220
DANEEN: I sure will.

614
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:55.656
RECEPTIONIST: Thank you.
Have a good one.

615
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.924
DANEEN: You too.

616
00:40:57.758 --> 00:41:00.871
LEAH: Are you some sort of crazy
atheist?

617
00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:03.564
Or is this some sort of
heathen revenge or something?

618
00:41:03.664 --> 00:41:06.400
AARON: I'd say everybody is an
atheist when it comes to other religions.

619
00:41:06.466 --> 00:41:08.069
LEAH: So you are an atheist.

620
00:41:08.602 --> 00:41:10.171
I was a believer.

621
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.807
But it turns out God is
irrelevant.

622
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.051
And hope is irrelevant.

623
00:41:14.075 --> 00:41:15.786
And anybody who tells you
anything different...

624
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.511
...is utterly and irredeemably
full of shit.

625
00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:18.478
LEAH: But why kill them?

626
00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:19.814
AARON: Because nothing makes!

627
00:41:19.847 --> 00:41:21.449
But you're too stupid
to understand that.

628
00:41:21.515 --> 00:41:22.249
LEAH: Excuse me?

629
00:41:22.316 --> 00:41:23.459
AARON: You're even smart
enough...

630
00:41:23.483 --> 00:41:24.652
...to know how stupid
you really are.

631
00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:25.786
LEAH: Fuck you!

632
00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:30.300
You want me to bash
your daddy's brains in...

633
00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:32.259
...but you can't
take a little shit?

634
00:41:32.492 --> 00:41:34.295
You're not ready for this.

635
00:41:34.762 --> 00:41:36.630
LEAH: My father fits the
profile.

636
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:40.201
He's a pastor. He could be added
to your list.

637
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:41.535
AARON: What list?

638
00:41:41.635 --> 00:41:44.138
LEAH: Your kill list.
Cut the shit out.

639
00:41:44.305 --> 00:41:47.108
AARON: If you want him dead so
bad why don't you kill him yourself?

640
00:41:48.509 --> 00:41:49.710
I don't have the balls.

641
00:41:49.777 --> 00:41:51.755
AARON: You should definitely
not be saying that...

642
00:41:51.779 --> 00:41:53.948
...to someone you're threatening
with a knife.

643
00:41:57.184 --> 00:41:59.120
LEAH: I was seven when he...

644
00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:04.558
My mother got us out of that
house.

645
00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:06.727
But he followed us out.

646
00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.564
I thought he was
gonna kill us...

647
00:42:11.799 --> 00:42:13.968
But my mother stabbed him.

648
00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:16.904
He fell on the ground.
He was bleeding

649
00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:20.374
But he didn't die.

650
00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:23.577
That son of a bitch didn't die.

to the cops.

00:42:43.898 --> 00:42:44.899
I said stop!

658
00:42:48.169 --> 00:42:51.572
Killing that motherfucker will
make no difference for you.

659
00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:53.707
It's not gonna change
the world or anything.

660
00:42:53.874 --> 00:42:56.186
AARON: Wrong. The world is
always changing.

661
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.579
The ones who can't change it
think it's always the same.

LEAH: Are you changing it?

663
00:43:01.215 --> 00:43:03.918
AARON: It's gonna change in ways
you cannot possibly imagine.

664
00:43:04.085 --> 00:43:06.587
LEAH: I think you give too much
credit to those priests.

665
00:43:06.687 --> 00:43:08.722
AARON: Don't believe me.
I don't care.

666

LEAH: I'll believe it when I see
it.

late. You'll just know.

Okay.

669
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.432

You're crazy.

00:43:26.207 --> 00:43:27.141
I'll do it.

00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:29.610
What?

673
00:43:30.444 --> 00:43:32.413
I'll add him to my list.

there's no going back.

No hesitation. No cold feet.

676
00:43:40.754 --> 00:43:42.591
No bullshit.

677
00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:50.464
Tell me why I shouldn't just
kill you right now instead of him.

678
00:43:53.134 --> 00:43:55.402
I just need to know
that he's dead.

679
00:43:56.337 --> 00:44:00.074
Kill him first and then you can
do whatever you want with me.

about a murderer.

priests or something.

Yep... That's right.

LEAH: Wait! Wait!

896
01:02:28.882 --> 01:02:29.950
Not yet.

897
01:02:46.735 --> 01:02:47.801
AARON: Not a good idea.

898
01:02:48.035 --> 01:02:49.103
FRANK: Please, don't.

899
01:02:50.204 --> 01:02:54.308
LEAH: I just wanna know that you
know why this is happening to you.

900
01:02:54.408 --> 01:02:55.610
FRANK: Please, Leah, don't do
this.

901
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:57.911
LEAH: Yo do know why this is
happening, don't you?

902
01:02:58.112 --> 01:02:59.813
FRANK: Everything I did was for
you.

903
01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:02.584
- FRANK: I did all for you.
- LEAH: Oh, you did?

904
01:03:02.651 --> 01:03:04.451
FRANK: Your mother's got it all
wrong.

905
01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:05.587
She's got it all wrong.

906
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.920
LEAH: What did she get wrong?

907
01:03:07.288 --> 01:03:09.290
[Frank cries]

908
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.592
She...

909
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.728
She thought she saw us.

910
01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:16.397
Me.

911
01:03:17.164 --> 01:03:18.165
But it wasn't true.

912
01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:19.900
LEAH: Just fucking admit it!

913
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:23.003
Just fucking have the
decency to admit it!

914
01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:24.749
FRANK: I swear to God it
wasn't true, Leah.

915
01:03:24.773 --> 01:03:25.906
I never touched you!

[dramatic music]

917
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:31.111
I never laid a hand on you.

918
01:03:36.183 --> 01:03:37.985
If you never did anything...

919
01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:43.957
...then why do I still feel you
every single night?

920
01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:47.428
FRANK: I loved you so much.

921
01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:50.497
I loved you so much.

922
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.303
I still do, my sweet baby girl.

AARON: Where to?

928
01:04:39.313 --> 01:04:39.913
What?

929
01:04:40.214 --> 01:04:41.982
AARON: Where do you want me
to drop you off?

930
01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:46.320
At my place.

931
01:04:46.987 --> 01:04:48.222

MATT: You ever hear
from that woman?

938
01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:05.600
The one with the gun?

939
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:08.335
LEAH: No... Besides, I haven't
been home in a couple of days.

940
01:06:08.469 --> 01:06:09.470
MATT: Where have you stayed?

941
01:06:10.404 --> 01:06:12.406
[melancholic music]

942
01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:15.409
LEAH: With a friend.

943
01:06:15.743 --> 01:06:17.010
A girlfriend.

944
01:06:20.748 --> 01:06:22.182
MATT: You should
call the police.

945
01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:23.952
LEAH: Yeah, I will.

[melancholic music continues]

947
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:31.124
LEAH: All of this has to
mean something, right?

948
01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:35.964
LEAH: Life has to mean
something.

949
01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:41.502
I mean, we can't just be born
and the work and then die.

950
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:45.540
MATT: That's what most
people do anyways.

951
01:06:46.473 --> 01:06:48.475
[melancholic music continues]

952
01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:51.345
LEAH: No. My mother saved me.

953
01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:53.213
That has to mean something.

954
01:06:55.048 --> 01:06:57.050
[melancholic music continues]

955
01:06:59.954 --> 01:07:02.198
All my life I've been
driven by this anger...

956
01:07:02.222 --> 01:07:04.726
...and this desire for revenge.

957
01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.663
Now that I had it, I...

958
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.832
[inaudible]

959
01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:12.867
...I feel completely empty
inside.

960
01:07:13.902 --> 01:07:17.505
MATT: You've lost your purpose.
Your sense of direction.

961
01:07:17.572 --> 01:07:19.574
[melancholic music continues]

962
01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:22.877
[inaudible]

963
01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:27.515
Yeah.

964
01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:29.316
I guess I have.

965
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.186
I'm a fucking nomad now.

[melancholic music continues]

968
01:07:54.441 --> 01:07:58.111
MATT: The meaning of life is the
one we give it ourselves.

969
01:07:59.112 --> 01:08:00.515
LEAH: I'm sorry, Matt.

970
01:08:00.949 --> 01:08:02.282
MATT: It's all good.

971
01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:04.451
We don't choose to be loved.

972
01:08:04.586 --> 01:08:06.353
Otherwise we'd always choose
better.

973
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.125
[melancholic music continues]

974
01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:18.198
Call the police
about that woman.

975
01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:19.534
LEAH: I said I will.

976
01:08:19.634 --> 01:08:21.268
MATT: Just let me worry
about you, okay?

977
01:08:21.468 --> 01:08:23.071
Okay, but I'm fine.

978
01:08:24.973 --> 01:08:25.940
Sure.

979
01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:28.876
When you really are...

980
01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:32.914
...you're not gonna miss any more
of my Saturday night dinner parties.

DANEEN: Please, stay.

984
01:08:54.802 --> 01:08:57.605
I have something that
someone like you might find...

985
01:08:58.238 --> 01:08:59.406
...interesting.

986
01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:03.511
I'm Dr. Daneen Bellman.

987
01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:05.613
Leah Thompson.

988
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:08.281
But I feel that you
already knew that.

989
01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:11.418
Are you a woman of faith?

990
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.123
No. I don't think so.

991
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:18.458
DANEEN: Good. That's gonna make
things much easier.

992
01:09:19.661 --> 01:09:23.430
DANEEN: What if I tell you I can
prove that God doesn't exist?

993
01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:25.700
LEAH: Sure, but you can't.

994
01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:27.802
That's where you are wrong.

995
01:09:27.869 --> 01:09:29.537
I already have.

996
01:09:29.937 --> 01:09:31.371
- LEAH: Scientifically?
- DANEEN: Yes.

997
01:09:31.438 --> 01:09:33.007
- LEAH: Mathematically?
- DANEEN: Yes.

998
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:34.008
Bullshit.

999
01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:35.308
DANEEN: You don't have to
believe me.

1000
01:09:35.342 --> 01:09:36.878
LEAH: Good, cause I don't.

1001
01:09:48.122 --> 01:09:50.825
Daneen Bellman.

1002
01:09:55.129 --> 01:09:56.731
You're kind of a big deal.

1003
01:09:56.898 --> 01:09:57.899
I am.

1004
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:01.869
LEAH: And you served in the
military.

1005
01:10:03.705 --> 01:10:05.840
LEAH: So there's no God or
anything.

1006
01:10:06.007 --> 01:10:07.407
DANEEN: Again, yes.

1007
01:10:07.508 --> 01:10:09.010
Yeah, this is stupid.

1008
01:10:09.309 --> 01:10:11.522
DANEEN: Stupind is not changing
your mind when...

1009
01:10:11.546 --> 01:10:14.247
...you haven evidence that
challenges your believes.

1010
01:10:14.347 --> 01:10:17.151
LEAH: I'm gonna need hard evidence if
you want me to bring this to the network.

1011
01:10:17.185 --> 01:10:18.986
DANEEN: I don't want you to
go to the network.

1012
01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:20.922
LEAH: Then what do you want?
I mean...

1013
01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:23.658
Sorry. I really don't
have time for this.

1014
01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:26.160
DANEEN: Aaron was a member of my
lab team.

1015
01:10:26.259 --> 01:10:28.529
He's a man of the cloth.
A man of faith.

1016
01:10:30.198 --> 01:10:31.199
He's a priest?

1017
01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:35.603
And a very dangerous one.

1018
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:39.049
DANEEN: Faith is an anti-virus.

1019
01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.876
It's a firewall that protects us
and makes us feel good.

1020
01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:43.945
It tells you exactly what you
want to hear.

1021
01:10:44.579 --> 01:10:46.446
But it can also make
you lose your mind.

1022
01:10:46.948 --> 01:10:49.550
The brain intakes the truth as
if it was a virus.

1023
01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.953
Some people are immune,
others get sick.

1024
01:10:52.587 --> 01:10:55.388
People are not ready
for the truth.

1025
01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:58.258
The same way Aaron wasn't.

1026
01:10:58.458 --> 01:11:01.763
LEAH: So you want to find Aaron
to make him stop spreading the truth.

1027
01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:04.866
DANEEN: I just don't want
anybody else to die.

1028
01:11:04.966 --> 01:11:08.202
The truth will inevitably come
to light.

1029
01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:10.972
But first we need to prepare
Humanity for it.

1030
01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:12.248
LEAH: But you know the truth.

1031
01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:14.184
And if you say that the truth
makes everyone insane, then...

1032
01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.375
...why aren't you crazy?

1033
01:11:19.547 --> 01:11:21.215
What makes you think I'm not?

1034
01:11:27.054 --> 01:11:28.222
Stay away from me.

1035
01:11:33.426 --> 01:11:35.428
[street noise]

1036
01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.466
AARON: I don't have
time for stalkers.

1037
01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:42.770
I wanted to see you.

1038
01:11:42.837 --> 01:11:43.838
AARON: What for?

1039
01:11:45.405 --> 01:11:47.074
Can I use your bathroom?

1040
01:11:56.617 --> 01:11:58.019
AARON: You know where it is.

1041
01:12:06.627 --> 01:12:08.129
AARON: Okay. Now you need to
leave.

1042
01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:09.263
- LEAH: Why?
- AARON: Look...

1043
01:12:09.429 --> 01:12:11.642
You wanted your father out of
the picture. You got it.

1044
01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.243
You wanted a good
fuck. You got it.

1045
01:12:13.267 --> 01:12:14.669
What more do you want from me?

1046
01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:16.537
LEAH: My father is dead.

1047
01:12:16.671 --> 01:12:19.372
And I literally feel no relief
at all.

1048
01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:22.844
You're the only person that I
can talk to about this.

1049
01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:24.444
AARON: How is this my problem?

1050
01:12:24.512 --> 01:12:26.113
LEAH: Because you're a priest!

1051
01:12:27.548 --> 01:12:30.661
LEAH: I was at the park today
and a woman came up to me...

1052
01:12:30.685 --> 01:12:32.863
...and said that you
worked with her on some...

1053
01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.822
sort of experiment or something?

1054
01:12:34.889 --> 01:12:36.290
AARON: Okay, you need
to leave now.

1055
01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:37.658
- LEAH: Why?
- AARON: Because she could've followed you.

1056
01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:39.293
- LEAH: She didn't.
- AARON: How the fuck do you know?

1057
01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:41.028
LEAH: Because she was still in
the park bench when I left.

1058
01:12:41.128 --> 01:12:42.830
AARON: And people on park
benches can't get up and walk?

1059
01:12:42.897 --> 01:12:44.508
- LEAH: I don't know!
- AARON: Look, you don't know...

1060
01:12:44.532 --> 01:12:46.143
...what's a stake here.
I can't take any risks.

1061
01:12:46.167 --> 01:12:47.635
You need to leave now.

1062
01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.680
LEAH: My life is literally
falling apart...

1063
01:12:49.704 --> 01:12:52.306
...and I can't make much
