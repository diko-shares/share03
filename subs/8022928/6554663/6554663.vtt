00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:08.746
Auradon.

2
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.141
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3
00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:15.711
I'm Mal, daughter of
Maleficent, and this is my home.

4
00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:17.234
It wasn't always.

5
00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.149
I was born
on the Isle of the Lost,

6
00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:21.150
where all the villains
had been banished,

7
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.934
locked away for good.

8
00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:24.981
That is, until Prince Ben
decided that their children

9
00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.504
should have a chance.

10
00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.245
So four villain kids--
the VKs-came to Auradon,

11
00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.681
including me.

12
00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:32.335
Long story short,
Ben's the king now.

13
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.859
I'm his girlfriend,

14
00:00:33.902 --> 00:00:36.165
and we are about to head back
to the Isle

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.865
to pick what will hopefully
be a long line of new VKs

16
00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:41.215
who get to come to Auradon
and find

17
00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:44.087
their happily ever afters, too.

18
00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.139

has finally arrived!

and someday very soon,
maybe we can.

105
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.704
Yeah, we're gonna be back
here so many times,

106
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.141
you're going to be
so sick of us.

107
00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:17.228
So sick of us.

108
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:20.624
Can we get a drumroll,
please?

109
00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.675
First, I would like to begin

110
00:05:27.718 --> 00:05:29.677
with the granddaughter
of Lady Tremaine,

111
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.591
daughter of Drizella,

112
00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:33.680
my sweet, sweet friend,

113
00:05:33.723 --> 00:05:34.682
my Dizzy.

114
00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:43.516
Next... the son of Smee.

115
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.865
Come on, Squeaky!

116
00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:53.961
And no way
we're splitting up the twins,

117
00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.312
so get over here, Squirmy,
come on!

118
00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:02.709
Bring it in, buddy!

119
00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:05.581
And last,
but certainly not least,

120
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.714
we all picked this girl
because we all agreed

121
00:06:07.757 --> 00:06:09.106
that she could use
a little bit

122
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:11.153
of Fairy Godmother's
goodness class.

123
00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:14.677
Give it on up for
Dr. Facilier's daughter, Celia!

124
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:15.548
I'm bad.

125
00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:23.077
We'll be back
for you guys next week, okay?

126
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.646
Yeah, so pack your stuff,
your own stuff.

127
00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:29.997
- Where are you going?!
- We're going to--

128
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.608
Auradon!

129
00:06:57.154 --> 00:07:00.158
Not a tentacle in sight.

130
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.726
I think if Uma
was up to something,

131
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.771
it'd be done by now.

132
00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:06.774
No, Ben,
I know how villains think,

133
00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:09.603
and I don't trust Uma
as far as I can throw her.

134
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:11.213
She's gonna wait until
our defenses are down

135
00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:13.170
and then that's
when she's gonna strike.

136
00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:15.173
I really wish I had time
to go do a dragon flyover,

137
00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.045
because I can go much higher.

138
00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:20.177
Well, you can't be
everywhere at once.

139
00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:21.788
Besides, I've got your back.

140
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:26.141
Come on, everyone's waiting
for us.

141
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:28.230
Wait.
You're getting more guards.

142
00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:30.624
I'm getting more guards.
Now, breathe.

143
00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.975
- Come on.
- Okay.

144
00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:48.031
Here they come.

145
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:10.838
Oh, stay.

146
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.795
- Stay here?
- Yes.

147
00:08:17.845 --> 00:08:19.802
Bippity-boppity,
one-two, one-two,

148
00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:21.108
can everybody hear me?

149
00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:23.764
Yes!

150
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.418
Ben.

151
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.290
Thank you,
Fairy Godmother.

152
00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:32.686

153
00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:37.517

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.282
No!

177
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:48.804
Yes.

178
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:06.562
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

179
00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:15.875
Makes our movie night
seem a little tame.

180
00:10:15.918 --> 00:10:17.006
I love yo--

181
00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:19.923
Movies.

182
00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:22.099
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:33.980
A lifetime of plans. Gone.

184
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:39.551
Our family status gone.

185
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.989
Audrey, you were supposed
to be his queen,

186
00:10:42.032 --> 00:10:44.774
and you let him slip
through your fingers.

187
00:10:44.817 --> 00:10:47.951
Your mother could hold on
to a prince in her sleep.

188
00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.953
Don't you think I feel
bad enough already, Grammy?

189
00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:52.607
Ben and Mal are the best!

190
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.566
I'm so excited for Mal
to be our queen.

191
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.221
You'd really rather have
a VK on the throne than me?

192
00:10:58.308 --> 00:11:00.181
What is wrong with you people?

193
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.014
What is wrong with everybody?

194
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:09.277
I'm engaged, man!

195
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:13.368
- What? Did you know?
- Everything.

196
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.936
You are gonna rock that crown.

197
00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:17.980
Okay, so I've only done
about a thousand sketches

198
00:11:18.024 --> 00:11:21.071
of your wedding dress, and...
Belle's already planned

199
00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:22.289
an engagement party next week!

200
00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:24.509
It's a really good thing
I said yes.

201
00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:28.034
- Hugs! Hi!
- Hugs. Hi!

202
00:11:28.077 --> 00:11:29.253
I finally get a daughter.

203
00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:31.038
- Congrats, Son.
- Thanks, Dad.

204
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.301
- I love you, Belle.
- Oh, I love you.

205
00:11:33.344 --> 00:11:35.999
Oh, sweetie.

206
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:37.086
So happy for you both.

207
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.001
Thank you so much,
Fairy Godmother.

208
00:11:39.046 --> 00:11:40.264
I think she liked it.

209
00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:43.092
Bippity-boppity, you betcha.

210
00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.095
All bow to Her Royal Majesty!

211
00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.967
Oh, yes!
Her Royal Purpleness!

212
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.057
Silence,
you annoying peasants.

213
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.884
- As you wish, my liege!
- Your Crankiness.

214
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:56.759
Congratulations.

215
00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:58.326
You won him fair and square.

216
00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:01.981
Oh, wait, no, you didn't.

217
00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:04.245
You spelled Ben to destroy
all of Auradon.

218
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.813
Touching story
for the grandkids.

219
00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.554
Okay, let's do this.

220
00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:14.645
Speaking of kids,
we have some kids waiting on us,

221
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.039
so... if you'll excuse me.

222
00:12:29.096 --> 00:12:31.924
- Congratulations, Lady Mal.
- Thank you.

223
00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:32.926
Your Majesty.

224
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:54.686
Alright, boys.
Let's hit the road.

225
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.557
You're gonna see him
soon, okay? Come on.

226
00:12:58.602 --> 00:13:01.128
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, I have everything.

227
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:04.086
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, Granny.

228
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.567
- Oh, really?
- My glue gun!

229
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.961
I don't know what you're
going to do without me.

230
00:13:09.962 --> 00:13:11.528
I'll miss you.

231
00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:15.403
Go on, go on.

232
00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:20.102
Goodbye, Granny.

233
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.283
Here, let me get this off you.

234
00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:28.633
- Oh.
- Okay.

235
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:32.115
Let's go and do... this.

236
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:50.960
So, as soon as we get
to Auradon,

237
00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:53.309
- you have to try ice cream.
- And go swimming?!

238
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:55.182
I can take you
to the Enchanted Lake.

239
00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.140
I can't believe
I get to live with you

240
00:13:58.184 --> 00:13:59.969
in your very own castle!

241
00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:02.101
It's just
a little starter castle.

242
00:14:02.144 --> 00:14:04.974
Great grip.
You play sports?

243
00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:06.846
Here.

244
00:14:08.673 --> 00:14:10.066
Go on.

245
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.024
Trust me on this.

246
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:18.988
I know.

247
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:20.990
Dig in, dig in.

248
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.001
You're going to be a wise
and brave king.

249
00:14:33.046 --> 00:14:35.004
He already is.

250
00:14:35.048 --> 00:14:37.615
See?
The cards never lie.

251
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:40.052
Ah.

252
00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:51.106
The only reason they should
be opening that barrier

253
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.240
is for putting Uma
back in,

254
00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:55.024
not letting more villains out.

255
00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:11.475
It's Hades.

256
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.259
Stop the car,
he's trying to escape!

257
00:15:18.307 --> 00:15:20.222
I am a god!

258
00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:23.269
I don't belong here!

259
00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:56.346
Do not panic!

260
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.086
- Okay, nobody needs to panic.
- It's Mal!

261
00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:02.221
There's your precious queen,
she can't even protect us!

262
00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:05.181
Okay, we're panicking,
bippity-boppity run!

263
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.188
Come on, Mal! Blast him!

264
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.690
Are you okay?

265
00:16:53.316 --> 00:16:55.927
- Are you okay?
- No.

266
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.841
He was draining all
of my magic with the ember

267
00:16:57.885 --> 00:17:00.192
and I felt... all of my power
slipping away.

268
00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:03.370
You're safe.
He's back where he belongs.

269
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.377
Yeah, for now.

270
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:14.468
- We should go.
- Okay.

271
00:17:22.824 --> 00:17:26.393
A lifetime of plans gone.

272
00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:28.351
Your mother
could hold on to a prince

273
00:17:28.394 --> 00:17:30.353
in her sleep.

274
00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:43.192
I'm so tired of pretending.

275
00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:45.977

this is my fault.

345

I'm supposed to protect Auradon.

346
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.586
You did.
You do protect Auradon.

347
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.806
Every time we open
the barrier,

348
00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:27.763
we're exposed to danger.

349
00:21:27.807 --> 00:21:31.637
Maleficent, Uma, Hades.

350
00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.996
Maleficent's scepter
and the queen's crown

351
00:21:42.038 --> 00:21:44.214
- have been stolen.
- Fairy Godmother:

352
00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:46.086
- Uma.
- We don't know that, Dad.

353
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.653
When the people hear this,

354
00:21:47.697 --> 00:21:50.134
they will never wanna leave
their houses.

355
00:21:50.177 --> 00:21:52.135
What do we tell them?

356
00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:57.445
Mal...
what do we do?

357
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.665
How do we keep evil
out of Auradon?

358
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:07.107
I think that there's only...

359
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:10.153
one way to guarantee
their safety.

360
00:22:12.155 --> 00:22:15.637
And I think that there...

361
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:20.948
can't be any more going
in and out.

362
00:22:23.124 --> 00:22:27.911
I think that we have to close
the barrier... forever.

363
00:22:32.654 --> 00:22:34.395
- No.
- Son.

364
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.832
- No.
- Ben.

365
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:38.138
- No, no, no.
- Ben.

366
00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:40.054
Hey.

367
00:22:40.096 --> 00:22:44.057
I do not want to take away
your dream,

368
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:46.843
because it was so beautiful,

369
00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:49.802
and it is why
I fell in love with you.

370
00:22:51.586 --> 00:22:56.635
But as king and as queen,
what's our duty?

371
00:22:58.246 --> 00:22:59.769
To protect Auradon.

372
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:04.861
But you know
what this would mean?

373
00:23:04.904 --> 00:23:06.776
All those kids.

374
00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:10.911
Are you prepared for that?

375
00:23:10.953 --> 00:23:13.392
I know what it means.

376
00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:17.526
And, no,
I'm not prepared for it.

377
00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:22.226
I just think that
we have no other choice.

378
00:23:26.012 --> 00:23:27.057
Son.

379
00:23:29.058 --> 00:23:30.973
Mal's right.

380
00:23:31.018 --> 00:23:32.801
I just don't think that
we would forgive ourselves

381
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:34.020
if something terrible happened.

382
00:23:42.028 --> 00:23:44.117
Who else knows
about the crown and the scepter?

383
00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:46.990
No one.
I mean, think about it,

384
00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:48.730
people are scared enough
as it is.

385
00:23:48.775 --> 00:23:51.342
We have to employ these
entirely new security measures.

386
00:23:51.385 --> 00:23:53.561
Will this delay our bringing
over more VKs?

387
00:23:53.605 --> 00:23:55.781
We're talking about closing
the barrier for good.

388
00:23:55.825 --> 00:23:57.044
But you said no.

389
00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:01.134
I mean, the four of us
are living the dream here,

390
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:03.136
and we finally get
to share that.

391
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.008
I mean, what could be
more important than that?

392
00:24:05.051 --> 00:24:08.184
Yeah. I know.

393
00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:13.756
I mean, maybe security.

394
00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:16.628
Or maybe peace of mind
for everyone in Auradon.

395
00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:19.153
Is that what they're thinking?

396
00:24:19.195 --> 00:24:21.285
M, were they seriously thinking
that no one will ever

397
00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:24.201
go in and out of the Isle
ever again?

398
00:24:24.244 --> 00:24:28.162
What, we never get to go back
and see our parents?

399
00:24:28.204 --> 00:24:30.076
And what about these kids?

400
00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:31.948
We promised them that they
could go back and visit

401
00:24:31.991 --> 00:24:33.689
whenever they wanted.

402
00:24:33.732 --> 00:24:35.211
Yeah, I know.

403
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:37.650
M, I'm so glad that you
are going to be queen.

404
00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:39.086
You'll be a part
of these conversations,

405
00:24:39.128 --> 00:24:42.828
you will stand up
for the VKs.

406
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.656
Thank you for telling me.

407
00:24:49.443 --> 00:24:51.271
And you'll be a great queen.

408
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.669
Wooh.
Morning. Got the beach towels.

409
00:24:56.711 --> 00:24:59.540
These. I really think she's
gonna like the cake, you guys.

410
00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:01.978
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, no.

411
00:25:02.021 --> 00:25:05.678
Okay, who got into Jane's cake?!

412
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:12.031
Delicious.

413
00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:14.250
I especially love
the lack of dirt.

414
00:25:16.863 --> 00:25:18.517
And the lack of flies.

415
00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:27.526
- Want some?
- Oh. Thank you.

416
00:25:37.839 --> 00:25:40.886
I was hoping you were home.

417
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.325
Is this a joke?

418
00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:46.457
What are you doing
with the crown and the scepter?

419
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.721
Well, I wanted them,
so I took them.

420
00:25:49.765 --> 00:25:52.288
You of all people
should understand that, Mal.

421
00:25:53.376 --> 00:25:57.556
Wait! Audrey, stop!
Don't use that.

422
00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:00.558
I thought you liked spells.

423
00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:05.867
- Okay, Audrey--
- Quiet!

424
00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:07.869
It's not a toy,
it's dangerous!

425
00:26:07.913 --> 00:26:09.436
I want to be dangerous!

426
00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:13.093
My life was perfect
until you stole it.

427
00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:16.530
And then Auradon turned
its back on me.

428
00:26:20.143 --> 00:26:21.710
It's time for a little payback.

429
00:26:21.753 --> 00:26:22.971
Audrey, wait!

430
00:26:34.027 --> 00:26:37.551
You think Ben will love you
now, you old hag?

431
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:39.205
You'll pay the price
for what you did,

432
00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:40.423
so will all of Auradon!

433
00:26:42.251 --> 00:26:43.950
So long, suckers.

434
00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:50.913
Uh, you might wanna think
of a spell for that.

435
00:26:50.957 --> 00:26:52.959
There's no spell
that can reverse

436
00:26:53.001 --> 00:26:54.829
the curse of the scepter.

437
00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:55.961
Well, that's a shame.

438
00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:57.484
Forget about me.

439
00:26:57.528 --> 00:27:01.357
Audrey's out for revenge,
and all of Auradon is in danger.

440
00:27:01.402 --> 00:27:02.924
What should we do?

441
00:27:02.969 --> 00:27:06.015
The only thing more powerful
than the scepter...

442
00:27:06.058 --> 00:27:07.146
is Hades' ember.

443
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.105
Oh, like he's just gonna
hand it over

444
00:27:09.148 --> 00:27:10.715
if you blew him
back to the Isle.

445
00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.281
No one knows
where his lair is.

446
00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:15.023
I do, I'm his errand rat.
I've got the key at my dad's.

447
00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:18.157
- You're coming.
- But I just got here.

448
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:20.115
Mal?

449
00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:24.032
Dizzy, stay here
to take care of the twins,

450
00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.904
we'll be right back and
everything will be just fine.

451
00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:26.775
Go inside.

452
00:27:26.818 --> 00:27:27.906
Guys, go get your stuff.

453
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.865
Come on, boys, let's go.

454
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:31.213
How bad is it?

455
00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:37.133
You age... beautifully.

456
00:27:37.176 --> 00:27:39.614
Now, let's just get you
into something fabulous.

457
00:27:39.657 --> 00:27:41.007
- Okay.
- Come on.

458
00:27:45.837 --> 00:27:47.796
Okay.

459
00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:50.058
- Oh, yeah. There we go.
- Okay.

460
00:27:50.103 --> 00:27:51.233
Almost there.

461
00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:08.163
Noble steed,
proud and fair,

462
00:28:08.208 --> 00:28:11.037
you shall take us anywhere.

463
00:28:20.001 --> 00:28:23.005
Carlos! You're gonna miss
Jane's birthday!

464
00:28:40.848 --> 00:28:42.111
Ah.

465
00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:45.070
Looks like Carlos
forgot your birthday, huh?

466
00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:47.028
Well, maybe not,
maybe he just took

467
00:28:47.073 --> 00:28:48.029
the wrong trail or something.

468
00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:49.770
Or, you know what?

469
00:28:49.815 --> 00:28:51.032
They probably don't celebrate
birthdays on the Isle,

470
00:28:51.076 --> 00:28:52.904
maybe it's like
a cultural thing.

471
00:28:52.948 --> 00:28:54.166
Oh. Yeah.

472
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:57.518
Or maybe he just forgot.
You never know.

473
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.999
Hey, Chad, look!
There's people taking selfies.

474
00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:02.435
Selfies! Guys!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

475
00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:03.872
Wait for me!
Wait for me!

476
00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:06.919
Why is she here?

477
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:09.748
Anybody save me
any guacamole?

478
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:11.880
No?

479
00:29:12.837 --> 00:29:14.970
Looks like someone
forgot to invite me.

480
00:29:15.623 --> 00:29:18.973
Well, don't be expecting Mal,
she's, uh...

481
00:29:21.106 --> 00:29:22.630
not feeling herself.

482
00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:26.894
Does that make you sad?

483
00:29:26.939 --> 00:29:29.070
Aw, does it just
ruin everything?

484
00:29:29.115 --> 00:29:30.898
Mindless little drones!

485
00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:33.771
How could you forget
what she did to us?

486
00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:36.035
How could you forget that I
was supposed to be your queen?!

487
00:29:36.077 --> 00:29:38.906
Time out! Okay, time out.

488
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:42.780
First off, great new look.
I absolutely love the feathers.

489
00:29:42.824 --> 00:29:44.739
But before you do whatever
you're gonna do,

490
00:29:44.782 --> 00:29:47.001
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted a, uh,

491
00:29:47.046 --> 00:29:48.916
royal boyfriend by your side.
Huh?

492
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:52.877
Partner in crime?
Sidekick?

493
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:55.881
Or maybe just a lackey
to, uh, do your bidding.

494
00:29:55.923 --> 00:29:58.144
Change tires?
Smoothie runs? Huh?

495
00:30:00.058 --> 00:30:01.103
Please.

496
00:30:01.146 --> 00:30:02.844
- You can be useful.
- Yeah?

497
00:30:02.887 --> 00:30:05.151
- Fine, stand behind me.
- Okay.

498
00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:06.979
If Auradon likes
to forget so much,

499
00:30:07.021 --> 00:30:09.938
they'll love this.

500
00:30:09.981 --> 00:30:14.813
♪ Happy birthday to you

501
00:30:16.204 --> 00:30:21.819

Audrey?

507
00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:52.023
Sweet dreams.

508
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.612
Hey, Jane,

509
00:31:15.655 --> 00:31:18.049
I'm on my way to the party,
the meetings ran long.

510
00:31:18.093 --> 00:31:19.355
No, no,
stay where you are, Ben.

511
00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:21.356
Audrey stole the scepter,
and everyone's asleep.

512
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:24.359
I'm gonna call Mom
and tell her to get her wand.

513
00:31:24.403 --> 00:31:26.579
Is Mal with you?

514
00:31:26.623 --> 00:31:29.060
Jane! Jane?

515
00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:54.259
Hey! I'm me again.

516
00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:56.697
Duh! Evil magic
doesn't work here.

517
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.263
Kind of the point.

518
00:31:58.307 --> 00:32:02.094
- Oof, welcome back.
- Thank you.

519
00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.643
- Hey!
- Daddy!

520
00:32:29.685 --> 00:32:32.079
There she is! Ha!

521
00:32:32.124 --> 00:32:33.472
Come on!

522
00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:35.300
And ooh. And ooh.

523
00:32:35.344 --> 00:32:37.519
Whoa! Ooh.

524
00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:38.868
Hey!

525
00:32:38.913 --> 00:32:40.959
Come here,
you little rascal.

526
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.134
Ah...

527
00:32:43.177 --> 00:32:45.920
So, what kind of hustle
you got going on

528
00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.661
with them shiny people?

529
00:32:47.703 --> 00:32:50.271
No hustle.
I got friends on the other side.

530
00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:53.536
Ah, I hear you, I hear you.

531
00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:56.670
We're on a mission.

532
00:32:56.712 --> 00:32:59.064
I'm kind of a major player,
so...

533
00:32:59.106 --> 00:33:01.326
that's why I can't stay long.

534
00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:03.981
You make sure you get
your cut.

535
00:33:11.858 --> 00:33:14.775
Alerts of the sleeping spell
keep coming in as it spreads

536
00:33:14.817 --> 00:33:15.993
throughout Auradon.

537
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:18.125
Uh, guys?
Come look at this.

538
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.388
There are rumors that
Sleeping Beauty's daughter,

539
00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:22.130
Audrey, is behind the spell.

540
00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:23.740
We're trying to discover
who is responsible

541
00:33:23.784 --> 00:33:25.307
for these vicious lies

542
00:33:25.351 --> 00:33:28.048
and which villain
has perpetrated this evil.

543
00:33:28.093 --> 00:33:30.182
We have an update.
It's what?

544
00:33:30.224 --> 00:33:31.791
It's moving this way?

545
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:33.141
It's moving this way!

546
00:33:35.273 --> 00:33:36.536
Whoa, rookie mistake?

547
00:33:36.578 --> 00:33:39.278
Long time nae see!

548
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.626
Get off my bike, Hook!

549
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.197
Catch me if you can, Jay!

550
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.199
- Over the roofs! Cut 'em off.
- Yeah.

551
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:49.983
Hey, hey, hey, not you.
They got this.

552
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.507
You and me gotta go
find the ember.

553
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.596
Good timing,
it's right about his nap time.

554
00:33:56.598 --> 00:33:58.601
Ah!

555
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:10.264
Hey.

556
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.355
How big is that dog?

557
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.097
You'll see.

558
00:34:24.931 --> 00:34:28.588
Okay, stay quiet,
it echoes like crazy in here.

559
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.862
Come. Come.

560
00:36:33.364 --> 00:36:35.409
What are you doing here?

561
00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:42.547
I noticed you were low
on canned corn.

562
00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:58.389
Hi, Dad.

563
00:37:05.047 --> 00:37:08.443
Quite a show you put on
the other day.

564
00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:10.139
Right back at ya.

565
00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:11.793
Hmm.

566
00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:15.188
I was just coming to see you.

567
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:18.365
Really? Wonder why.

568
00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:19.802
Is it because
I'm gonna be queen?

569
00:37:19.846 --> 00:37:24.067
Now, Mal,
don't be bitter.

570
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.027
You abandoned me
when I was a baby.

571
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.422
No. No, I left your mother.

572
00:37:32.423 --> 00:37:34.643
She's--

573
00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:37.559
she's not the easiest
person to get along with.

574
00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:39.952
- You think?
- Oh. See?

575
00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:41.867
We have something in common
already.

576
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:43.260
We both hate your mother.

577
00:37:43.304 --> 00:37:47.525
No.
I don't hate my mother.

578
00:37:47.568 --> 00:37:51.050
She may be an evil lunatic,
but at least she stuck around.

579
00:37:51.094 --> 00:37:54.010
Aww. Boo-hoo.

580
00:37:54.054 --> 00:37:56.577
Wake up and smell the stink.

581
00:37:56.621 --> 00:37:58.492
You think you've had it rough?

582
00:37:58.536 --> 00:38:01.016
I used to be a god!

583
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:04.411
I had an entire world
which bore my name,

584
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:07.632
and now I have nothing!

585
00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:09.547
You have no idea
what that feels like.

586
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.983
Really?!

587
00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:14.552
Because for 16 years,
I had nothing!

588
00:38:15.858 --> 00:38:19.644
And now, I have a whole world.

589
00:38:19.688 --> 00:38:23.170
But unless I get that ember,
it's game over.

590
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:31.309

he's always asking about you.

656

Evie is the only one

657
00:42:27.806 --> 00:42:32.114
And as far as I'm concerned,
he doesn't even exist.

658
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.346
No, no, I want the Auradon
guard handing out gas masks.

659
00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:48.086
Well, not everyone's asleep!

660
00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:51.960
Find out if anyone's
seen Audrey.

661
00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:54.135
And find if she has
a list of demands.

662
00:43:06.539 --> 00:43:08.976
Just one.

663
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:10.978
I demand my life back.

664
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:14.592
I have a proposition.

665
00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:17.637
I'll wake everybody up
right now.

666
00:43:19.248 --> 00:43:24.079
Under one...
itty bitty condition,

667
00:43:24.123 --> 00:43:25.297
Benny Boo.

668
00:43:28.954 --> 00:43:31.826
Make me your queen
and we'll rule side by side.

669
00:43:37.135 --> 00:43:38.876
Did someone put
a spell on you?

670
00:43:40.922 --> 00:43:44.447
- You just tell me who, and I'll--
- You'll what? Marry them?

671
00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:50.976
Most people get dumped
because they aren't good enough.

672
00:43:51.018 --> 00:43:52.630
I wasn't bad enough.

673
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:56.416
How do you like me now,
Benny Boo?

674
00:43:58.199 --> 00:44:00.289
I like the old Audrey better.

675
00:44:01.987 --> 00:44:04.076
She wouldn't wanna hurt
Auradon.

676
00:44:07.295 --> 00:44:10.472
Just... give me the scepter
and I'll forgive you.

677
00:44:11.778 --> 00:44:12.954
You'll forgive me?

678
00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:16.827
I don't think so.

679
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:18.960
Sleeping is too good for you!

680
00:44:21.266 --> 00:44:23.356
Sleeping is too good
for Auradon.

681
00:44:37.282 --> 00:44:40.155
Alright. Get in, get out.
Jay, you good?

682
00:44:40.199 --> 00:44:42.505
- Yeah.
- Okay. Hold on.

683
00:44:51.079 --> 00:44:52.994
Whoa, you got a little
Hades' thing going.

684
00:44:53.038 --> 00:44:54.300
- Wow.
- That thing packs a punch, huh?

685
00:44:54.342 --> 00:44:55.954
Ha.

686
00:44:59.217 --> 00:45:01.001
- We made it, bro.
- We made it.

687
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.614
Hey, guys, we just come
for a... wee visit.

688
00:45:08.009 --> 00:45:09.663
Hey! Hey! Hey!

689
00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:15.233
No!

690
00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:26.853
Drop something?

691
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:29.204
It can't get wet!
Give it back before it goes out!

692
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.338
Uma!

693
00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.818
That's my name.

694
00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:40.476
No!

695
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.969
Hi, boys.

696
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.541
Welcome back!

697
00:46:01.583 --> 00:46:04.369
Uma. You swam off
and forgot all about us.

698
00:46:04.413 --> 00:46:06.284
Yeah, planning her revenge,
no doubt.

699
00:46:06.327 --> 00:46:09.070
It's not all about you, Mal.

700
00:46:09.114 --> 00:46:11.159
I was looking for a hole
in the barrier,

701
00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:12.465
to let everybody out.

702
00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:14.074
And you know what I found, boys?

703
00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:16.990
It's way better out there
than we thought.

704
00:46:17.034 --> 00:46:18.992
There's this thing that looks
like a furry rock

705
00:46:19.036 --> 00:46:20.298
called a coconut.

706
00:46:20.342 --> 00:46:24.389
And fish so big you could
dance on their backs.

707
00:46:24.432 --> 00:46:26.958
And they've been keeping it
all for themselves.

708
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:30.135
Whatever.
Uma, I need that to break a spell.

709
00:46:30.177 --> 00:46:32.485
Cast by Audrey,
Sleeping Beauty's daughter.

710
00:46:32.527 --> 00:46:35.574
Hmm, so the good guy's
the bad guy?

711
00:46:35.617 --> 00:46:39.012
Well,
I might not give it back.

712
00:46:39.056 --> 00:46:40.101
See what happens.

713
00:46:40.144 --> 00:46:41.362
Uma, it's not
the time for games!

714
00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:43.364
People's lives are in danger!

715
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:49.545
Guarantee me that every single
villain kid who wants to

716
00:46:49.588 --> 00:46:50.981
can get off the Isle.

717
00:46:51.025 --> 00:46:52.983
I can't do that.

718
00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.159
Can't do that.

719
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:56.161
- Well, how about now?!
- Deal!

720
00:46:56.204 --> 00:46:57.161
Deal.

721
00:46:57.204 --> 00:46:58.945
Uma!

722
00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:02.949
Her word is good.

723
00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:10.130
I'll still keep this...

724
00:47:10.175 --> 00:47:12.568
for the time being.

725
00:47:12.612 --> 00:47:16.050
Because if I think I trust you
to save the world on your own,

726
00:47:16.094 --> 00:47:17.137
think again.

727
00:47:18.878 --> 00:47:20.141
This is a job for pirates!

728
00:47:22.012 --> 00:47:24.144
We can always go back
to hating each other

729
00:47:24.188 --> 00:47:25.798
when this is over.

730
00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:30.195
Fine.

731
00:47:32.239 --> 00:47:33.197
Where are our bikes?

732
00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.070
Oh, yeah.
We crashed them.

733
00:47:36.114 --> 00:47:39.117
Vrum!

734
00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:45.166
- Look at his face.
- Here's a thought.

735
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.081
We could try to be friends.

736
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:50.128
Put our history behind us
and celebrate our differences.

737
00:47:52.085 --> 00:47:53.173
Yeah?

738
00:47:55.045 --> 00:47:57.222
Who wants gum?

739
00:47:57.264 --> 00:47:58.831
Let's go.

740
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.050
No?

741
00:48:00.094 --> 00:48:05.143
Ah! No.
I'm in charge. Let's go.

742
00:48:20.766 --> 00:48:23.248
They're asleep.

743
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:25.032
Everyone.

744
00:48:25.076 --> 00:48:28.121
I can't get Ben.
Or Dizzy or Doug.

745
00:48:28.166 --> 00:48:29.907
Or Jane, the signal's out.

746
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:33.126
Is that Auradon Prep?

747
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:36.086
Yeah, and when everybody wakes
up, you're gonna love it.

748
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.132
Yes!

749
00:48:38.175 --> 00:48:41.092
- Everything is so...
- Freaky.

750
00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:42.744
...green.

751
00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:45.052
You have leaves on your trees!

752
00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:47.097
And what are those color things
in the bushes?

753
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:49.099
Uh... flowers?

754
00:48:49.143 --> 00:48:51.057
Flowers are pretty.

755
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:52.972
Cantaloupe?!

756
00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:55.148
Mm. Mmmm.

757
00:48:55.193 --> 00:48:58.282
We don't have any fresh
fruit on the Isle, remember?

758
00:48:58.326 --> 00:49:00.762
Mmm. Thank you.

759
00:49:00.806 --> 00:49:02.764
They're grapes.

760
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:04.070
Grapes.

761
00:49:05.333 --> 00:49:06.943
Love grapes.

762
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:08.119
Ooh.

763
00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:13.123
I believe I deserve
some compensation

764
00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:16.083
for my muscles, my wile,

765
00:49:16.126 --> 00:49:18.302
and my role in this endeavor.

766
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:21.132
You do.

767
00:49:21.175 --> 00:49:23.047
Me not squashing you like a bug.

768
00:49:25.135 --> 00:49:27.050
Like I'm scared of you, Jay.

769
00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:28.139
Guys.

770
00:49:30.271 --> 00:49:32.186
- Mmm!
- Dude!

771
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.014
Delicious. Mmm.

772
00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:36.364
Dude, really?

773
00:49:36.407 --> 00:49:39.237
What?! It wasn't me, I swear!
Okay, it was me.

774
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.152
Oh, do you know
what happened here?

775
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:44.197
Yep, Audrey showed up,
she put everybody to sleep,

776
00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:46.199
and then she turned some
of them to--

777
00:49:46.244 --> 00:49:47.766
Guys.

778
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:49.115
Hannah turned to stone.

779
00:49:53.338 --> 00:49:55.340
Alright, everybody
stay on their toes.

780
00:49:55.382 --> 00:49:57.342
Look, since we're here,
let's check the school.

781
00:49:57.385 --> 00:50:00.300
No. Audrey went straight
for the crown,

782
00:50:00.344 --> 00:50:02.215
so I think it's safe to assume
she's gonna go

783
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.913
for Ben and his castle next.

784
00:50:03.956 --> 00:50:05.219
That's where we'll go.

785
00:50:05.262 --> 00:50:08.309
- Says who?
- Says me.

786
00:50:08.353 --> 00:50:10.137
Says you. That's supposed
to mean something to me?

787
00:50:10.181 --> 00:50:11.181
Guys.

788
00:50:15.186 --> 00:50:17.231
To the castle.

789
00:50:28.677 --> 00:50:32.202
- How did Mal break my spell?!
- I don't know.

790
00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:34.335
And what is Uma doing here?!

791
00:50:34.378 --> 00:50:35.467
No, no, no, no!

792
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.860
Come clean, Chad!

793
00:50:37.903 --> 00:50:40.036
Hey, hey.

794
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.646
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

795
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.126
I don't know, okay?

796
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.389
- I can go check for you--
- Stay!

797
00:50:52.135 --> 00:50:53.179
It's about to get
a little ugly.

798
00:50:59.273 --> 00:51:01.362
Ben!

799
00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:02.885
Ha! This way.

800
00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:05.974
Ugh.
Ben could be asleep anywhere.

801
00:51:06.018 --> 00:51:09.021
- Or turned to stone.
- Okay.

802
00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.197
Ben!

803
00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.112
I got a scent,
very pungent cologne,

804
00:51:12.155 --> 00:51:13.112
easy to track.

805
00:51:13.157 --> 00:51:14.331
Follow me, people.

806
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:15.550
That's great, Dude.

807
00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:18.248
FYI, I give great
cuddles, too.

808
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:20.641
Really?
I never had a pet growing up.

809
00:51:20.686 --> 00:51:22.469
Except for the elk head
in dad's man cave,

810
00:51:22.514 --> 00:51:25.211
- but that's not really--
- Hold up.

811
00:51:25.255 --> 00:51:26.692
What's this?

812
00:51:28.302 --> 00:51:29.347
Uh...

813
00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:31.436
Any chance this was
already there?

814
00:51:32.827 --> 00:51:34.438
And follow me!

815
00:51:37.398 --> 00:51:39.226
Ben!

816
00:51:40.358 --> 00:51:41.402
Ben!

817
00:51:45.188 --> 00:51:47.713
Ben? Ben?

818
00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:51.282
Stay here. Okay?

819
00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:58.157
I can feel you lurking.

820
00:51:59.289 --> 00:52:01.161
Good.

821
00:52:01.204 --> 00:52:03.641
So you can track, cuddle,
and talk.

822
00:52:03.684 --> 00:52:06.210
Hey, do you think his puppies
will be able to talk, too?

823
00:52:06.253 --> 00:52:08.472
Alright, man.
He's taken.

824
00:52:08.516 --> 00:52:10.257
You want a dog?
Adopt a rescue.

825
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:14.173
Talking puppies.
That's crazy.

826
00:52:14.217 --> 00:52:16.262
- Come here.
- He seems nice.

827
00:52:18.525 --> 00:52:20.353
I bet you lost
some sleep

828
00:52:20.398 --> 00:52:22.487
thinking about me
on the loose, huh?

829
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.447
No. Dragons don't really
lose sleep.

830
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.492
I wondered what
fried octopus tastes like.

831
00:52:28.536 --> 00:52:30.190
Okay, why do we not?

832
00:52:30.233 --> 00:52:31.844
We're celebrating
our differences.

833
00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.068
I believe we're being
challenged.

834
00:52:39.112 --> 00:52:40.418
Let's split up
and look for Audrey.

835
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.070
That makes absolutely
no sense,

836
00:52:42.114 --> 00:52:44.248
unless you give me my ember,
she's gonna spell you.

837
00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:46.293
Girls!

838
00:52:46.336 --> 00:52:48.338
We have a situation here.

839
00:52:49.556 --> 00:52:51.516
You like a prince, Mal?

840
00:52:51.559 --> 00:52:53.996
How about a knight
in shining armor?

841
00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:55.389

We did that!

912
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.780
That's what I'm talk--

913
00:56:33.824 --> 00:56:36.697
- Ugh!
- Hey, good job!

914
00:56:38.742 --> 00:56:40.222
No. No.

915
00:56:48.579 --> 00:56:53.192
Guys, come on.
This was so great!

916
00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:54.889
We were a team.

917
00:56:54.932 --> 00:56:57.239
We worked together.
Come on.

918
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:01.853
- Come on.
- Mm-mm.

919
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:08.032
You know what we should try?

920
00:57:08.815 --> 00:57:10.295
An ice breaker.

921
00:57:12.777 --> 00:57:15.170
You say something you really
like about the other person.

922
00:57:15.213 --> 00:57:17.215
Okay? I'll start.

923
00:57:22.047 --> 00:57:23.222
Harry.

924
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:27.139
Great accent.

925
00:57:27.181 --> 00:57:28.532
Now, you go.

926
00:57:28.574 --> 00:57:30.534
Is she always this perky?

927
00:57:30.577 --> 00:57:31.969
It wasn't really
your turn, but thank you.

928
00:57:32.012 --> 00:57:34.188
- Okay, Evie? Come here.
- Yeah.

929
00:57:34.233 --> 00:57:36.190
- I love you.
- I love you.

930
00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:38.976
I love this energy,
but we are very short on time.

931
00:57:39.019 --> 00:57:40.760
Audrey clearly knows
that we're here,

932
00:57:40.804 --> 00:57:42.067
we need to get
out of here ASAP.

933
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.981
Alright, where does this
cheerleader bunk down?

934
00:57:44.025 --> 00:57:46.679
Even if she's not there,
we might find some sort of clue.

935
00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:48.159
Actually, she's still
in the dorms.

936
00:57:48.202 --> 00:57:50.030
You're right,
because of summer school.

937
00:57:50.074 --> 00:57:52.990
What? Summer school?

938
00:57:53.034 --> 00:57:56.864
Summer? School?
No wonder she wants revenge.

939
00:57:56.907 --> 00:57:59.780
Okay, I need you guys
to go find Ben.

940
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:03.001
We will meet back at Evie's
in two hours, okay?

941
00:58:03.043 --> 00:58:05.177
Sounds like we're going with my plan.
I'm just saying.

942
00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:06.786
It was kind of
the obvious plan.

943
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:08.702
- Uma said it first.
- Right, so my plan.

944
00:58:08.746 --> 00:58:09.659
Whatever.

945
00:58:23.586 --> 00:58:25.458
She's nowhere on campus.

946
00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:27.025
Found her diary.

947
00:58:27.068 --> 00:58:28.896
And, dang, did you ruin
Audrey's life.

948
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.507
Okay, so did you find
anything in there

949
00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:32.769
that we don't already know,
or?

950
00:58:32.813 --> 00:58:34.510
She hangs out
at Fairy Cottage.

951
00:58:34.554 --> 00:58:36.077
You know, where Flora,
Fauna and Merryweather

952
00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:37.862
hid her mom from your mom.

953
00:58:37.905 --> 00:58:40.255
Yes, ha, ha, ha,
the irony is not lost on me.

954
00:58:40.298 --> 00:58:44.128
How can anyone
with this bed ever be unhappy?

955
00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:46.523
Okay, how do I look?

956
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.440
Okay, the bling stays here.

957
00:58:51.483 --> 00:58:52.833
But she's bad.

958
00:58:52.876 --> 00:58:54.965
And we're not.

959
00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:00.362
Ben!

960
00:59:00.405 --> 00:59:02.190
Ben.

961
00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:07.673
Dude. Come on. Nothing?

962
00:59:07.717 --> 00:59:10.110
These things just
grow everywhere.

963
00:59:15.943 --> 00:59:18.293
Hey, we should play
that ice breaker.

964
00:59:18.336 --> 00:59:22.123
Um... Jay, I like the way
that you can...

965
00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:25.170
bounce around
and jump off things.

966
00:59:25.213 --> 00:59:26.911
These are free, right?

967
00:59:28.347 --> 00:59:30.175
Yeah, um...

968
00:59:33.918 --> 00:59:36.920
I like how you get a kick
out of a berry bush.

969
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.708
I guess you've probably
seen everything by now, huh?

970
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:44.275
Furry rocks, giant fish,

971
00:59:44.318 --> 00:59:46.146
you're probably used
to grabbing lunch

972
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:47.278
off of a bush.

973
00:59:47.322 --> 00:59:49.498
No, I mean, usually no,
not really.

974
00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:52.065
I mainly just use the vending
machines at practice.

975
00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:54.199
Tourney kinda eats up
most of my time, so...

976
00:59:54.242 --> 00:59:59.072
Tourney?
That's a wee boy's game.

977
00:59:59.117 --> 01:00:01.293
Right.
You know what would be fun?

978
01:00:01.335 --> 01:00:03.730
To go rafting in a jungle river.

979
01:00:03.773 --> 01:00:06.210
- Find a lost civilization.
- Ooh, maybe a penguin.

980
01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:07.952
Well, you find those more
on like icebergs,

981
01:00:07.994 --> 01:00:10.389
but, I'd love to see
one of those.

982
01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:12.739
You guys are killing me.

983
01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:21.922
Mmm.

984
01:00:21.965 --> 01:00:23.532
PS, your mutt went that way.

985
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.143
Carlos!

986
01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:27.014
- Dude, what do you see?
- This way.

987
01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:39.940
I really hope they found Ben.

988
01:00:39.983 --> 01:00:41.985
Nice digs.

989
01:00:42.028 --> 01:00:44.248
I got a really good deal.

990
01:00:58.306 --> 01:01:00.481
Shh, it's okay.

991
01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.893
Don't worry, Dizzy.

992
01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.853
We can fix this.

993
01:01:24.027 --> 01:01:26.072
And once we do,
they're gonna let all the kids

994
01:01:26.117 --> 01:01:28.293
come from the Isle.

995
01:01:28.335 --> 01:01:30.990
So... happy dreams.

996
01:01:40.217 --> 01:01:42.742
- Uh, who's the dude?
- Doug.

997
01:01:45.222 --> 01:01:46.963
Doug.

998
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.009
Wake up.

999
01:01:49.967 --> 01:01:50.836
Wake up.

1000
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.882
He's spelled.

1001
01:01:52.925 --> 01:01:54.014
Is she not a fast learner?

1002
01:01:54.057 --> 01:01:56.320
She's emotionally involved,
okay?

1003
01:01:58.452 --> 01:01:59.498
Well, in that case,

1004
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.152
she should be able
to wake him up.

1005
01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:06.331
True love's kiss?
Works every time?

1006
01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:10.248
Well, we haven't actually
used the L word yet.

1007
01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:17.690

1057
01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.097
Ben!

1058
01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:34.233
Oh, boy, something stinks
and it wasn't me this time.

1059
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:43.068
- No!
- Whoa!

1060
01:05:50.076 --> 01:05:51.295
Watch out!

1061
01:05:57.561 --> 01:05:59.128
You need some serious
nose adjustments.

1062
01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:01.086
I'm not so sure.

1063
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.048
Ben?
Did Audrey do that?

1064
01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:08.094
Ah. I thought I recognized
those pants.

1065
01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:13.186
Aw, he's got a boo-boo,
that's why he's so cranky.

1066
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:14.579
You know,
my dad said that his dad

1067
01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:17.277
did not handle pain well at all.

1068
01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:21.934
You're good with animals.
Do something.

1069
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.110
But--
Okay. Alright.

1070
01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.333
Okay, Ben.

1071
01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:32.335
It's me. Carlos. Alright?

1072
01:06:32.378 --> 01:06:34.338
Whoa! Ben, Ben, it's Carlos.

1073
01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.166
Alright? You know me.

1074
01:06:37.384 --> 01:06:39.472
You helped me once.

1075
01:06:39.516 --> 01:06:42.563
Remember with Dude? Right?
Let me help you.

1076
01:06:44.217 --> 01:06:46.045
Come on,
let me see your hand.

1077
01:06:46.088 --> 01:06:47.177
There you go. Alright.

1078
01:06:47.219 --> 01:06:52.572
Atta boy--uh, beast--king,
whatever.

1079
01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.358
Oh, yeah, it's a big one.

1080
01:06:56.273 --> 01:06:57.403
I'm gonna count, alright?

1081
01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:59.492
One.

1082
01:06:59.536 --> 01:07:02.105
Two.

1083
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.282
There it is! You did it!

1084
01:07:16.248 --> 01:07:17.163
Hey!

1085
01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.210
Oh, my gosh.

1086
01:07:21.253 --> 01:07:22.342
--I forgot to call.

1087
01:07:22.385 --> 01:07:24.083
I'm so glad you're alright!

1088
01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.219
- Alright. You good?
- Yeah.

1089
01:07:30.262 --> 01:07:32.135
- Take a seat right there.
- Yeah.

1090
01:07:32.177 --> 01:07:33.570
There you go.

1091
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:42.231
- Oh, that was... funky.
- Was. Is.

1092
01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.146
- Huh? Oh, wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

1093
01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:50.239
- You need another blast.
- Uh, please--

1094
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.070
Please. Stop.

1095
01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:55.244
Huh.

1096
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.333
It's Enchanted Lake water,

1097
01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:59.335
but I guess it can
only do so much.

1098
01:07:59.378 --> 01:08:02.121
Well, well, well.

1099
01:08:03.469 --> 01:08:09.085
Harry Hook, and you,
my little duckling, are...

1100
01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.215
ravishing.

1101
01:08:12.478 --> 01:08:15.394
Okay, uh, ravishing
and taken.

1102
01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:17.440
Just in case anyone
was confused.

1103
01:08:17.484 --> 01:08:18.703
Hold on.

1104
01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:21.706
Whose side are they on?

1105
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.360
They escaped and joined us.

1106
01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:26.189
Mal has the ember,
which is our only hope

1107
01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:28.190
to stop Audrey,
details to follow.

1108
01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:30.367
Hades' ember?
Has Mal gone back to the Isle?

1109
01:08:30.409 --> 01:08:32.238
I said "Details to follow,"
we're meeting up

1110
01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:33.935
- Mal, Evie and Uma, let's go.
- Uma?!

1111
01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:36.068
Details to follow.

1112
01:08:42.204 --> 01:08:44.337
Hey, Jay, um...

1113
01:08:44.381 --> 01:08:47.252
Yeah, thanks for saving
me gorgeous face.

1114
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.305
That was a really good idea.

1115
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:58.220
To check Audrey's room.

1116
01:08:59.351 --> 01:09:01.310
Now we know that
we're on the right track.

1117
01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.399
Is there an insult in there
that I missed?

1118
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.318
Just... I wanted to thank you.

1119
01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.454
Ugh! Think you're
on the right track?

1120
01:09:15.498 --> 01:09:17.369
We're not going anywhere.

1121
01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:20.460
Let's mess them up a little.

1122
01:09:20.503 --> 01:09:22.113
I say we go back
to my place

1123
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.462
and maybe binge-watch some TV.
Huh?

1124
01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:26.292
Or maybe order some
stuff online. Yeah? Yeah.

1125
01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:29.207
Oh.
What about pizza? Huh?

1126
01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:32.123
You don't like pizza.
Salad.

1127
01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:38.869
No, no, no. Audrey.

1128
01:09:38.912 --> 01:09:44.180
Audrey!

1129
01:09:44.222 --> 01:09:45.180
Audrey!

1130
01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:50.837
I don't know whose birthday it
is, but I want this cake.

1131
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.016
So, I... maybe kinda missed
the boat a little bit

1132
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.456
on calling you Shrimpy and not
letting you join the gang.

1133
01:10:01.065 --> 01:10:02.936
Yeah.

1134
01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.765
We really could've torn up
the Isle together.

1135
01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:26.831
- Celia!
- We're trapped!

1136
01:10:26.873 --> 01:10:29.747
- Are you guys okay?
- What's going on?

1137
01:10:29.789 --> 01:10:31.618
You've caused my friends
pain and fear,

1138
01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:33.967
we've had enough,
now disappear!

1139
01:10:36.753 --> 01:10:38.712
You guys, I'm sorry,
my spells aren't working.

1140
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.149
Audrey's magic
is getting stronger.

1141
01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:45.719
You caused our
friends pain and fear,

1142
01:10:45.762 --> 01:10:47.981
we had enough, now disappear!

1143
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:57.382
You did it.

1144
01:10:58.427 --> 01:10:59.907
Together.

1145
01:11:01.038 --> 01:11:03.259
This is what I've been
talking about.

1146
01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:05.869
I guess my shell likes you.

1147
01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.225
Why don't you hold on to that?

1148
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:24.409
Hey, it's your bae.

1149
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:31.677
Hi! Hi!

1150
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.203
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

1151
01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:37.380
I'm so much better right now.
Are you okay?

1152
01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:38.641
Yeah.

1153
01:11:42.645 --> 01:11:44.604
I always knew you'd be
part of the solution.

1154
01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:50.131
- What is this?
- Oh, yeah.

1155
01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:52.264
- I could get used to this.
- You like it?

1156
01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.484
- I love this.
- What about those?

1157
01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:56.659
- Oh.
- No.

1158
01:11:56.703 --> 01:11:59.140
I like 'em.

1159
01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.533
Okay, so we all think
that Audrey

1160
01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:02.970
could be at Fairy Cottage.

1161
01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:04.711
We've no idea where it is,
did she take you there?

1162
01:12:04.755 --> 01:12:06.626
Every Fairy Godmother's Day.

1163
01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.324
Where is Fairy Godmother
when you need her?

1164
01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.716
I wish I knew.

1165
01:12:12.414 --> 01:12:17.680
Hey, um, this might be
a bad time, but, uh...

1166
01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:18.855
happy birthday.

1167
01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:20.466
I made it with my 3D printer.

1168
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:25.470
It's, uh,
our names put together.

1169
01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:27.125
- No, right, I get it.
- Yeah.

1170
01:12:27.167 --> 01:12:29.301
Because, you know,
we're together, you and me,

1171
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.475
you know, like a couple.

1172
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.390
Right, 'cause Jane
and Carlos make "Jarlos."

1173
01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:34.045
Yes, yeah!
I could've gone with Cane,

1174
01:12:34.087 --> 01:12:37.527
but... I went with Jarlos,
unless you prefer Cane,

1175
01:12:37.569 --> 01:12:39.658
- do you prefer Cane?
- Oh, no. No, I love it.

1176
01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:41.966
Yes, you do, it's fine, you know what?
I can remake it.

1177
01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:45.490
- It's cool, it's fine.
- No, Carlos. It's perfect.

1178
01:12:50.539 --> 01:12:52.105
Doug.

1179
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:53.280
Go with Jane.

1180
01:12:53.324 --> 01:12:54.543
You need to find
Fairy Godmother.

1181
01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.936
- They might need some muscle.
- Hey.

1182
01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.417
Well, I'll go.

1183
01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.287
Yeah, actually,
I would feel better.

1184
01:13:00.332 --> 01:13:02.421
Yeah, actually,
I'd feel better, too.

1185
01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:03.944
Same.

1186
01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:05.903
Actually, I would, too.

1187
01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:07.644
Alright, man, let's do it!

1188
01:13:07.686 --> 01:13:09.559
- Let's go, Jane.
- Okay.

1189
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:11.734
- Be careful, okay?
- I will.

1190
01:13:23.485 --> 01:13:24.573
Come on, Dude.

1191
01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.662
She's not upstairs.

1192
01:14:24.546 --> 01:14:26.636
Chad?

1193
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:28.288
I want my mommy.

1194
01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:30.552
What happened--

1195
01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:31.814
It's okay.

1196
01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:35.296
What happened, buddy?

1197
01:14:40.039 --> 01:14:41.215
Hmm.

1198
01:14:42.738 --> 01:14:46.220
Ben. Ben! Oh!

1199
01:14:46.264 --> 01:14:47.483
Your face.

1200
01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:52.270
She's gone, huh?

1201
01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:53.532
The door's open.

1202
01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:57.667
I'm free. Free!

1203
01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.407
Freedom!

1204
01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:10.810
Oh, my gosh.

1205
01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:17.860
Hi, Mom.

1206
01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:20.777
Um, I don't know
if you can hear me,

1207
01:15:20.819 --> 01:15:24.257
but it's been a really
crazy day.

1208
01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:26.434
On the plus side,
it's been the longest birthday

1209
01:15:26.478 --> 01:15:28.087
I've ever had.

1210
01:15:28.131 --> 01:15:31.091
On the minus side,
everybody's under an evil spell.

1211
01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:33.877
Um. But on the plus side,
Carlos remembered my birthday.

1212
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.878
See?

1213
01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:38.011
We're going to figure out
how to undo this.

1214
01:15:38.055 --> 01:15:40.100
We'll find a way
to make this right, Mom.

1215
01:15:42.537 --> 01:15:44.234
Oof, alright,
let's get this Audrey chick

1216
01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:45.671
taken care of already.

1217
01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:47.368
What do you say, girl?

1218
01:15:47.412 --> 01:15:50.371
Time to wrap things up?

1219
01:15:50.414 --> 01:15:52.503
You know, someday,
you're gonna have to tell me

1220
01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.332
how you guys all got
teamed up.

1221
01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:57.552
Actually, Mal promised
to let all the kids

1222
01:15:57.595 --> 01:15:59.685
off the Isle
once this is over.

1223
01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:00.904
Mal?

1224
01:16:00.947 --> 01:16:02.557
I have to tell you guys
something.

1225
01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.172
Um...

1226
01:16:12.305 --> 01:16:14.220
I lied to you.

1227
01:16:18.137 --> 01:16:21.314
The kids won't be
coming off the Isle.

1228
01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:22.707
What do you mean?

1229
01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:24.448
The program is shut down.

1230
01:16:26.103 --> 01:16:29.759
And the barrier
will be closed for good.

1231
01:16:30.802 --> 01:16:32.369
For Auradon's safety.

1232
01:16:33.936 --> 01:16:35.024
Hold up.

1233
01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:38.898
So we're saving
your precious people,

1234
01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:41.247
and your behinds,
for a lie?

1235
01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:46.210
I knew it was a mistake
to trust you.

1236
01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:49.212
You're always out
for yourself.

1237
01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:53.216
And you, King Benny.

1238
01:16:58.135 --> 01:17:00.877
You're probably just gonna
throw us all back inside, eh?

1239
01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:07.100
You know what?

1240
01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:09.407
I actually thought
you were brave,

1241
01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:11.322
but you're
nothing but a chicken.

1242
01:17:11.364 --> 01:17:14.020
Too scared to tell me I was
never gonna see my dad again.

1243
01:17:14.064 --> 01:17:15.194
Celia.

1244
01:17:15.238 --> 01:17:16.457
Celia, Celia! No!

1245
01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:21.462
Celia, no! no! Ugh!

1246
01:17:21.506 --> 01:17:24.203
Regain your might and ignite!

1247
01:17:24.247 --> 01:17:26.162
No.

1248
01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:28.381
Regain your might and ignite!

1249
01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:34.823
Bummer.

1250
01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:39.176
Let's go find Gil
and leave 'em all to rot.

1251
01:17:39.219 --> 01:17:40.176
No.

1252
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:43.266
Uh.

1253
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.181
Uma!

1254
01:17:51.753 --> 01:17:55.801
Evie. I'm so sorry.

1255
01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:59.021
I'm sorry, I just...
I thought that...

1256
01:17:59.064 --> 01:18:00.457
I was afraid to tell you,

1257
01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.851
I thought that I was gonna
lose my best friend.

1258
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:07.465
But I had to do something,
I had to... protect Auradon.

1259
01:18:07.507 --> 01:18:09.685
Closing the barrier
was your idea?

1260
01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:11.121
I did it for us!

1261
01:18:12.774 --> 01:18:17.082
I did it for... our life
that we have here now.

1262
01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:19.694
For our life?!

1263
01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:23.610
What about the kids that we
left behind on that island?!

1264
01:18:23.654 --> 01:18:26.396
The kids that we promised.

1265
01:18:26.439 --> 01:18:28.051
We were their only hope.

1266
01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:33.229
I thought you were gonna
stand up for the VKs.

1267
01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.842
But instead you lied to them.

1268
01:18:41.064 --> 01:18:42.152
And you lied to Jay.

1269
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.328
And you lied to Carlos.

1270
01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:48.287
You lied to me.

1271
01:18:51.073 --> 01:18:52.684
We're your family.

1272
01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:55.904
Evie.

1273
01:18:58.689 --> 01:19:01.779
Evie, come on!
I had no choice!

1274
01:19:06.088 --> 01:19:07.872

01:21:02.073 --> 01:21:03.032

You brought this on
yourself, Mal.

1308
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:27.143
You figure out how to fix it.

1309
01:21:27.185 --> 01:21:28.274

Save your little friend, Mal!

Help me, Mal!

1331
01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.172
Careful not to fry
your little VK buddy.

1332
01:23:26.217 --> 01:23:27.131
Whoa!

1333
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.533
She doesn't stand a chance
without the ember.

1334
01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:39.362
Help me, Mal!

1335
01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:43.234
Come on!

1336
01:23:46.324 --> 01:23:48.153

01:24:02.645 --> 01:24:05.387

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:07.042
Regain your might and ignite.

01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.131
I'm right here, girl,
I'm right here.

1341
01:24:09.173 --> 01:24:12.002
Regain your might and ignite!

1342
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.229
Yes!

1343
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.842
Want a piece of this? Huh?!

1344
01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:27.365
No! No!

1345
01:24:45.036 --> 01:24:46.211
Come on, Mal!

1346
01:24:46.255 --> 01:24:48.430
- Get her, Mal!
- You got this, girl!

1347
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:59.920
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yeah!

1348
01:25:11.975 --> 01:25:15.065
- Mal!
- Oh, Celia.

1349
01:25:15.979 --> 01:25:18.635
It's okay. I've got you.

1350
01:25:30.515 --> 01:25:31.864
Audrey?

1351
01:25:32.909 --> 01:25:34.345
Oh no.

1352
01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:41.179
You're only half Hades.

1353
01:25:41.222 --> 01:25:43.747
The ember won't do everything
for you that it does for me.

1354
01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:04.114
I'm hungry.

1355
01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.463
Same.

1356
01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:17.520
Oh!

1357
01:26:17.563 --> 01:26:19.086
Mom! Mom!

1358
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.305
Bippity-boppity,
what happened?

1359
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.875
The spell has been broken.
It's okay.

1360
01:26:31.489 --> 01:26:34.100
Come on. Let's go.

1361
01:26:34.145 --> 01:26:35.929
- You good?
- Yeah.

1362
01:26:40.456 --> 01:26:42.197
She's slipping away.

1363
01:26:49.029 --> 01:26:51.902
There's only one person
in the world who might be able

1364
01:26:51.944 --> 01:26:54.121
to do something about this,
and that's Hades.

1365
01:26:54.164 --> 01:26:56.733
Hades?
He wouldn't do it.

1366
01:26:56.775 --> 01:26:58.168
And I wouldn't risk it.

1367
01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.997
Actually,
he might do it for me.

1368
01:27:01.954 --> 01:27:03.435
He's my father.

1369
01:27:07.351 --> 01:27:08.353
Okay.

1370
01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:13.010
Well, I'll have to send guards
to get him.

1371
01:27:13.618 --> 01:27:15.055
Maybe I can hitch a ride.

1372
01:27:17.841 --> 01:27:19.451
The Isle is my home.

1373
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.411
Someone needs to be there
to protect it.

1374
01:27:23.846 --> 01:27:26.457
Well, then,
you'll need your first mate.

1375
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.506
The Isle will be
in very good hands.

1376
01:27:33.377 --> 01:27:34.684
Can I go, too?

1377
01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:39.863
I wish I could be
in both places.

1378
01:27:51.613 --> 01:27:54.180
I really think
that Evie was right.

1379
01:27:54.225 --> 01:27:58.097
And... I do think that
we could've been friends.

1380
01:28:01.885 --> 01:28:05.235
And I'm really sorry
that I lied to all of you guys.

1381
01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.671
You deserve so much better
than that.

1382
01:28:06.716 --> 01:28:08.979
You're just trying to do
the right thing.

1383
01:28:09.021 --> 01:28:10.240
Yeah.

1384
01:28:18.858 --> 01:28:20.295
I get it.

1385
01:28:50.063 --> 01:28:51.935
Thank you for coming.

1386
01:28:51.978 --> 01:28:54.154
Didn't have much choice.

1387
01:28:55.851 --> 01:28:57.680
Can you wake her?

1388
01:28:57.722 --> 01:29:00.595
Since when do heroes
care about villains?

1389
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:02.771
- She's--
- One of your own?

1390
01:29:04.686 --> 01:29:05.992
Right.

1391
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.042
When you guys try
to destroy the world,

1392
01:29:13.086 --> 01:29:14.783
it's an error in judgment.

1393
01:29:16.176 --> 01:29:18.613
But when it's one of us,

1394
01:29:18.657 --> 01:29:20.658
lock 'em up,
throw away the key.

1395
01:29:22.573 --> 01:29:24.576
Right, Beast?

1396
01:29:30.538 --> 01:29:32.583
Yeah, I'm gonna need to use
my hands.

1397
01:29:56.564 --> 01:29:59.045
Haven't lost my touch.

1398
01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:07.966
Dad.

1399
01:30:34.253 --> 01:30:37.997
Oh, Audrey.
You're okay.

1400
01:30:41.783 --> 01:30:43.698
Tell me it was all
a bad dream.

1401
01:30:43.742 --> 01:30:47.963
I wish I could.
But it's over now.

1402
01:30:54.012 --> 01:30:55.797
I'm sorry.

1403
01:30:57.842 --> 01:30:59.104
I wanted to hurt you both.

1404
01:31:01.064 --> 01:31:03.021
I wanted to hurt all of you.

1405
01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:12.814
I have owed you an apology

1406
01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:16.208
for a very long time now.

1407
01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:20.823
And so have I.

1408
01:31:23.826 --> 01:31:27.002
And perhaps... I...

1409
01:31:27.046 --> 01:31:29.832
have owed you one, too.

1410
01:31:39.057 --> 01:31:41.538
Oh yeah.

1411
01:32:01.123 --> 01:32:02.734
Dad!

1412
01:32:08.827 --> 01:32:11.787
I'm gonna have to miss you
all over again.

1413
01:32:13.744 --> 01:32:16.051
Thanks for a glimpse
of the sun.

1414
01:33:06.755 --> 01:33:08.104
There they are.

1415
01:33:14.197 --> 01:33:15.894
Hey.

1416
01:33:31.997 --> 01:33:33.302
Lady Mal and I
wanna thank you

1417
01:33:33.345 --> 01:33:35.697
for celebrating
our engagement with us today.

1418
01:33:35.739 --> 01:33:39.135
I couldn't be prouder
or happier to call you my queen.

1419
01:33:40.962 --> 01:33:42.833
So...

1420
01:33:42.877 --> 01:33:44.922
raise your glasses.

1421
01:33:44.966 --> 01:33:46.315
To our future queen
of Auradon.

1422
01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:48.970
To our queen of Auradon.

1423
01:33:50.233 --> 01:33:51.756
Speech, Your Specialness.

1424
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.801
Speech, Oh, Fancy One.

1425
01:34:08.729 --> 01:34:09.818
I can't.

1426
01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:15.127
I can't be queen of Auradon.

1427
01:34:15.171 --> 01:34:17.738
- Mal?
- I can't turn my back

1428
01:34:17.782 --> 01:34:19.043
on the Isle.

1429
01:34:24.962 --> 01:34:29.967
We made a decision to close
the barrier forever.

1430
01:34:34.103 --> 01:34:36.104
And it was my idea.

1431
01:34:38.846 --> 01:34:40.021
But it's wrong.

1432
01:34:43.286 --> 01:34:48.247
I've learned that you can't
live in fear.

1433
01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:52.860
Because it doesn't actually
protect you from anything.

1434
01:34:55.863 --> 01:35:00.171
You never know where
the bad is gonna come from.

1435
01:35:00.216 --> 01:35:01.826
And you never know where
the heroes

1436
01:35:01.869 --> 01:35:03.261
are gonna come from either.

1437
01:35:03.305 --> 01:35:06.875
Without Uma and her pirates,
Auradon would be gone.

1438
01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:13.097
And without Hades...
my father--

1439
01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:23.020
Audrey would be gone.

1440
01:35:28.157 --> 01:35:31.421
We are all capable
of good and bad,

1441
01:35:31.463 --> 01:35:34.903
no matter which side
of the barrier we come from.

1442
01:35:36.295 --> 01:35:39.863
And that's why I can't be
queen of just Auradon.

1443
01:35:39.908 --> 01:35:43.127
I have to be queen
of the Isle, too,

1444
01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:48.264
and it's time that we take
the barrier down forever.

1445
01:35:48.306 --> 01:35:50.135
We can't do that.

1446
01:35:50.179 --> 01:35:51.962
It's up to us, Dad.

1447
01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:01.145
I choose to be a king
who moves forward.

1448
01:36:02.626 --> 01:36:05.106
It's time for forgiveness.

1449
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:06.978
It's time for new beginnings.

1450
01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:11.461
The barrier will come down.

1451
01:36:11.503 --> 01:36:13.158
Yes!

1452
01:36:16.944 --> 01:36:18.903
Bring it down, Mal.

1453
01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:55.069
To make the world
a better place...

1454
01:36:55.113 --> 01:36:57.942
...we have to
do it face to face.

1455
01:37:44.902 --> 01:37:47.208
My plan.

1456
01:37:47.252 --> 01:37:49.167

I'm actually really nervous
to meet your mom.

1524
01:42:21.351 --> 01:42:24.311
You're nervous?!
His mom is Cruella de Vil!

1525
01:42:24.354 --> 01:42:26.966
I'm petrified!

1526
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:28.837
Wait 'til she hears
I wanna be a vet.

1527
01:42:28.881 --> 01:42:31.274
What do you say you and me go exploring?
I'll do a gap year.

1528
01:42:31.319 --> 01:42:33.103
Jungles or icebergs?

1529
01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:35.149
Both?

1530
01:42:35.192 --> 01:42:36.541
Yeah. Chest bump!

1531
01:42:39.675 --> 01:42:41.110
- Hey!
- Wooh!

1532
01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.503
Go, girl.

1533
01:42:42.546 --> 01:42:45.070
You know what?
Mal came through.

1534
01:42:45.114 --> 01:42:46.463
She always does.

1535
01:42:46.507 --> 01:42:48.422
So she's
definitely taken?

1536
01:42:48.466 --> 01:42:50.381
Definitely.

1537
01:42:50.425 --> 01:42:52.382

1538

Uma.

No.

1541
01:43:02.131 --> 01:43:03.438

- Hi.

01:43:06.396 --> 01:43:07.484
Whoa!
