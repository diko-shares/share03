00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.920
<i>I'm Mal, daughter of Maleficent.</i>

<i>It wasn't always.</i>

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.440
<i>I was born</i>

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.680
<i>where all of the villains</i>
<i>had been banished,</i>

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.120
<i>locked away for good.</i>

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.520
<i>That is until Prince Ben decided</i>
<i>that their children</i>

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.720
<i>should have a chance.</i>

10
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120
<i>And so, four villain kids,</i>
<i>the V.K.'s,</i>

11
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.680
<i>came to Auradon, including me.</i>

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
<i>Long story short,</i>
<i>Ben is the king now,</i>

13
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.840
<i>I'm his girlfriend, and we</i>

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.280
<i>to the Isle to pick</i>
<i>what will hopefully be</i>

15
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.440

113
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.840
And no way,
we're splitting up the twins,

114
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.280
so get over here, Squirmy,
come on.

And last,
but certainly not least,

118
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.200
we all picked this girl
because we all agreed

119
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.800
that she could use a little bit
of Fairy Godmother's

120
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960
goodness class.

121
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.560

I think if Uma was up
to something, we'd know by now.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.640
No, Ben,
I know how villains think.

132
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.240
And I don't trust Uma,
as far as I can throw her.

133
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.960
She's gonna wait
until our defenses are down

134
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.720
and then,
that's when she's gonna strike.

135
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960
I really wish I had time
to go do the dragon flyover

136
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.760
because I can go so much higher.

137
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.280
Well, you can't be everywhere
at once.

138
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.640
Besides, I've got your back.

139
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.160
Now, come on,
everyone's waiting for us.

140

Wait.
But you're getting more guards?

-They'll be here soon.
-Not like we had a choice.

It worked out pretty well
for the first four.

163
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.800
Yeah, especially for you.

164
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.720

Mal, this is the exact spot
we first met not so long ago.

I feel like I've known you
my whole life.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.240
<i>All of my senses</i>
<i>Have left me defenseless</i>

340
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.280
<i>This darkness around me</i>
<i>Is promising vengeance</i>

341
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.960
<i>The price that I'm willing</i>
<i>To pay is expensive</i>

342
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.480
<i>There's nothing to lose</i>
<i>When you're lonely and friendless</i>

343
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.440
<i>So my only interest</i>
<i>Is showing this princess</i>

344
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.800
<i>That I am the Queen</i>
<i>And my reign will be endless</i>

345
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.520
<i>I want what I deserve</i>
<i>I wanna rule the world</i>

346
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.040
<i>Sit back and watch them learn</i>

347
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.120
<i>It's finally my turn</i>

348
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.920
<i>If they want a villain</i>
<i>For a Queen</i>

349
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.520
<i>I'm gonna be one that</i>
<i>They've never seen</i>

350
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.840
<i>I'll show them what it means</i>
<i>Now that I am that</i>

351
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.800
<i>I will be the ruler</i>
<i>Of the dark and the bad</i>

352
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.520
<i>Because the devil's</i>
<i>On my shoulder</i>

353
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.360
<i>Where the angels used to be</i>

354
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.440
<i>And he's calling me</i>
<i>The Queen of Mean</i>

355
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.480
<i>Calling me, calling me</i>

356
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.880
<i>-Calling me, calling me</i>
<i>-The Queen of Mean</i>

357
00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.240
<i>Calling me, calling me</i>

358
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.520
<i>I want what I deserve</i>

359
00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.800
(SONG ENDS)

360
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.840
BEAST: <i>I think we all know</i>
<i>why we're here.</i>

361
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.360
The people are in a panic
about Hades.

362
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.600
He almost got out.

363
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.000
Who knows what he would've done
if he had escaped?

364
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.960
We can't risk having
another villain on the loose.

365
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.200
I really feel like
this is my fault.

366
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.200
I'm supposed to protect Auradon.

367
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.360
You did, you do protect Auradon.

368
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.040
Every time we open the barrier,
we're exposed to danger.

369
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.600
Maleficent, Uma, Hades.

370
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.720
(CELLPHONE RINGING)

371
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.560
Maleficent's scepter
and the queen's crown

372
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.400
-have been stolen.
-(FAIRY GODMOTHER GASPS)

373
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.400
-Uma?
-We don't know that, Dad.

374
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.240
When the people hear this,
they will never

375
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.560
wanna leave their houses.

376
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.160
What do we tell them?

377
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480
Mal?

378
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.840
What do we do?

379
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.120
How do we keep evil
out of Auradon?

380
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.920
I think that there's only...

381
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.000
one way
to guarantee their safety.

382
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.440
And I think that there...

383
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.600
can't be anymore going
in and out.

384
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.240
I think that we have to close
the barrier...

385
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600
forever.

386
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.720
-No.
-Son.

387
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.400
-No.
-Ben.

388
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.920
-BEN: No, no, no, no.
-MAL: Ben.

389
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.160
Hey.

390
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.960
I do not want to take away
your dream.

391
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.600
Because it was so beautiful.

392
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.560
And it is why
I fell in love with you.

393
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.200
But as King, and as Queen...

394
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.640
what's our duty?

395
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.120
To protect Auradon.

396
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.320
But do you know
what would this mean?

397
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.960
All those kids?

398
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.000
-Are you prepared for that?
-I know what it means...

399
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.320
and no, I'm not prepared for it.

400
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.400
I just think that we have
no other choice.

401
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.480
Son?

402
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.000
Mal's right.

403
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.480
I just don't think that we would
forgive ourselves

404
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.160
if something terrible happened.

405
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.840
EVIE: Who else knows
about the crown and the scepter?

406
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.120
No one. (CHUCKLES)

407
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.800
I mean, think about it,

408
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.280
people are scared enough
as it is.

409
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.160
We have to employ these
entirely new security measures.

410
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.160
Will this delay
our bringing over more V.K.'s?

411
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.400
We're talking about closing
the barrier for good.

412
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.680
But you said no.

413
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.760
I mean, the four of us
are living the dream here,

414
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.360
and we finally
get to share that.

415
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.840
I mean, what could be
more important than that?

416
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200
Yeah.

417
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.520
I know.

418
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.240
I mean, maybe security or maybe
peace of mind

419
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.720
-for everyone in Auradon.
-Is that what they're thinking?

420
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.480
And were they seriously thinking
that no one will ever go

421
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.600
in or out
of the Isle ever again?

422
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.000
What, we never get to go back
and see our parents?

423
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.680
And what about these kids?

424
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.440
We promised them that they could
go back

425
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.880
and visit whenever they wanted.

426
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.480
Yeah, I know.

427
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.320
M., I am so glad
that you are going to be Queen.

428
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.240
You will be a part
of these conversations,

429
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.080
you will stand up
for the V.K.s.

430
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.120
Thank you for telling me.

431
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.640
You're gonna be a great Queen.

432
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280
-Morning. Got the beach towels.
-Sorry. Morning.

433
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.640
-These.
-Hey.

434
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.440
I really think she's gonna like
the cake, you guys.

435
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.000
-Oh, yeah?
-CARLOS: Oh, no.

436
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.880
Okay. Who got into Jane's cake?

437
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.880
Delicious.

438
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.560
I especially love
the lack of dirt.

439
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.560
And the lack of flies.

440
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.640
-Want some?
-Thank you.

441
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.480
(BOTH SIGH)

442
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.680
I was hoping you were home.

443
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.240
(CHUCKLES)

444
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.040
Is this a joke?

445
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.360
What are you doing
with the crown and the scepter?

446
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.840
Well, I wanted them,
so I took them.

447
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.480
And you, of all people
should understand that, Mal.

448
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.360
Wait, Audrey, stop!
Don't use that.

449
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.800
I thought you liked spells.

450
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840
-Okay, Audrey, you're better...
-Quiet!

451
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.040
-It's not a toy. It's dangerous.
-I want to be dangerous.

452
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.600
My life was perfect
until you stole it.

453
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.280
And then Auradon
turned its back on me.

454
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.480
Well, it's time
for a little payback.

455
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.240
Audrey, wait!

456
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.040
(LAUGHS)

457
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.520
You think Ben will love you now,
you old hag?

458
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.000
You'll pay the price
of what you did and so will

459
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.120
all of Auradon.

460
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.160
So long, suckers!

461
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.680
Whoa! You might wanna think
of a spell for that.

462
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.760
There's no spell
that can reverse

463
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.360
the curse of the scepter.

464
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.920
-Well, that's a shame.
-MAL: Forget about me.

465
00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.120
Audrey's out for revenge.
And all of Auradon is in danger.

466
00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.200
What should we do?

467
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.280
The only thing more powerful
than the scepter...

468
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.360
-is Hades' ember.
-JAY: Oh!

469
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.320
Like he's just gonna hand
it over, give them back

470
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.560
-to the Isle.
-And no one knows

471
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.160
-where his lair is.
-CELIA: I do.

472
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.560
I'm his errand rat.
I've got the key at my dad's.

473
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.360
You are coming.

474
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.920
But I just got here.

475
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480
DIZZY: Mal?

476
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.040
(SCREAMS)

477
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.400
Dizzy, stay here to take care
of the twins.

478
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.560
We'll be right back
and everything will be just fine.

479
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.240
Go inside.
Guys, go get your stuff.

480
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.720
DIZZY: Come on, boys, let's go.

481
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.920
How bad is it?

482
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.240
You age beautifully.

483
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.360
Now, let's just get you
into something fabulous.

484
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560
-Okay.
-EVIE: Come on.

485
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720
Okay.

486
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.720
-Oh, yeah, there we go.
-Okay.

487
00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.400
Almost there.

488
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.640
Noble steed, proud and fair,
you shall take us anywhere.

489
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.800
Carlos, you're gonna miss
Jane's birthday.

490
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.240
CHAD: (LAUGHS) Oh.

491
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.200
Looks like Carlos forgot
about your birthday, huh?

492
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.200
Well, maybe not, maybe he just
took the wrong trail

493
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.440
or something. Or you know what?

494
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.840
They probably
don't celebrate birthdays

495
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.800
on the Isle, maybe it's like
a cultural thing.

496
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.200
Oh, yeah.

497
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.160
Or maybe he just forgot.
You never know. (CHUCKLES)

498
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.800
Hey, Chad, look!
There's people taking selfies.

499
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.120
Selfies! Guys,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

500
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.520
Wait for me! Wait for me!

501
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.840
FEMALE VOICE: Why is she here?

502
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.160
Did anybody save me
any guacamole?

503
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.600
No?

504
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.800
It's like someone forgot
to invite me.

505
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.120
Well, don't be expecting Mal,
she's...

506
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.360
not feeling herself.

507
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.120
Does that make you sad?

508
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.400
Does it just ruin everything?

509
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.720
Mindless little drones.

510
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.680
How could you forget

Do you like a prince, Mal?

those pants.

Oh, he's got a boo-boo.
That's why he's so cranky.

that his dad

It's Enchanted Lake water.

Okay. Ravishing and taken...

1123
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.520
just in case
anyone was confused.

1124
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.800
Hold on.

Who's side are they on?

1126
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.560
They escaped and joined us.

1127
01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.680
And Mal has the ember,
which is our only hope

1128
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.480
to stop Audrey.
Details to follow.

1129
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.680
Hades' ember?
Has Mal gone back to the Isle?

1130
01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.200
I said details to follow.
We're meeting up

Hey, Jay... (CLEARS THROAT)

1134
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.600
...yeah, thanks for saving me,
gorgeous face.

1135
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.360
That was a really good idea,
to check Audrey's room.

1136
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.240
Now, we know
that we're on the right track.

1137
01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.040
Is there an insult in there
that I missed?

1138
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.640
Just...

1139
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.880
I wanted to thank you.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.120
No! You think
you're on the right track?

We're not going anywhere!

Let's mess them up a little.

1143
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.200
I say we go back to my place
and maybe binge-watch some TV?

1144
01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.200
Huh? Or maybe
order some stuff online?

1145
01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.160
Yeah? Yeah.

1146
01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.200
What about pizza, huh?

1147
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.640
Yeah, you don't like pizza.

the boat a little bit on

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.760
calling you Shrimpy
and not letting you

1157

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.680
Yeah.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.080

the Isle together.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.680
Oh!

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.760
-MAL: Celia!
-We're trapped!

1162
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.800
Are you guys okay?
What's going on?

1163
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.720
You've caused my friends pain
and fear.

1164
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.960
We've had enough, now disappear!

1165
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.760
You guys, I'm sorry.
My spells aren't working.

1166
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.880
Audrey's magic
is getting stronger.

1167
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.800
BOTH: You've caused our friends
pain and fear

1168
01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.120
we've had enough, now disappear.

1169
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.080
No!

1170
01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.520
You did it!

1171
01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.840
Together!

1172
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.920
This is what I've been
talking about.

1173
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.400
-I guess my shell likes you.
-(LAUGHS)

1174
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.200
Why don't you hold on to that?

-BEN: Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm so much

1180
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.840
-better right now. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

I always knew you'd be part
of the solution.

1183
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880
-What is this?
-Oh, yeah.

1184
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.720
-I could get used to this.
-You like it?

1185
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.000
I love this.

1186
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.120
-What about those?
-BEN: Oh.

1187
01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.880
-No.
-I like them.

1188
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.640
Okay, so, we all think
that Audrey could be

1189
01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.400
at Fairy Cottage.
We have no idea where it is.

1190
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.160
-Did she ever take you there?
-Every Fairy Godmother's Day.

1191
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.800
Where is Fairy Godmother
when you need her?

1192
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.600
I wish I knew.

1193
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.240
Hey, this might be a bad time.
But...

1194
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.440
Happy birthday.
I made it with my 3D printer.

1195
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.720
That's our names put together.

1196
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.440
-JANE: No. I get it, yeah.
-Yeah, because,

1197
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.120
you know, we're together.
You and me were like a couple.

1198
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.400
Right. 'Cause Jane and Carlos
make Jarlos.

1199
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.680
Yes. Yeah.
I could've gone with Cane, um,

1200
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.440
but I went with Jarlos.
Unless you prefer Cane.

1201
01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.640
-Oh, no. No, I love it.
-You prefer Cane? Yes, you do.

1202
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.600
It's fine. You know what?
I can remake it. It's cool.

1203
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.240
-It's fine.
-No, Carlos.

1204
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.960
It's perfect.

1205
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.920
Doug! Go with Jane.

1206
01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.640
We need to find
Fairy Godmother.

1207
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.360
-They might need some muscle.
-Hey.

1208
01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.960
Well, I'll go.

1209
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.280
Yeah, actually,
I would feel better.

1210
01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.960
Yeah, actually,
I'd feel better, too.

1211
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.000
Same.

1212
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.440
Actually, I would, too.

1213
01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.680
All right, man. Let's do it.

1214
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.320
-Let's go, Jane.
-Okay.

1215
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.320
-Be careful, okay?
-JANE: I will.

1216
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.480
CARLOS: Come on, Dude.

1217
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.640
She's not upstairs.

1218
01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.000
(BANGING ON DOOR)

1219
01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.640
Chad?

1220
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.920
I want my mommy.

1221
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.120
No.

1222
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.040
BEN: It's okay.

1223
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.920
What happened, buddy?

1224
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.080
Hmm.

1225
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.280
Ben. Ben! (GASPS)

1226
01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.560
Your face.

1227
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.000
She's gone? Huh?

1228
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.560
The door is open. I'm free.
Freedom! Oh!

1229
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.080
Freedom!

1230
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.120
JANE: Oh, my gosh.

1231
01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.160
Hi, Mom.

1232
01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.080
Um,

1233
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.920
I don't know if you can hear me.

1234
01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.880
But it's been
a really crazy day.

1235
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600
On the plus side,
it's been the longest birthday

1236
01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.880
I've ever had.

1237
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.080
On the minus side,
everybody's under an evil spell.

1238
01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.280
But on the plus side,
Carlos remembered my birthday.

1239
01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.600
See?

1240
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.000
We're going to figure out
how to undo this.

1241
01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.800
We'll find a way
to make this right, Mom.

1242
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.560
UMA: Ooh. All right.
Let's get this Audrey chick

1243
01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.800
taken care of already.

1244
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.800
-(MAL LAUGHS)
-What do you say, girls?

1245
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.280
Time to wrap things up?

1246
01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.960
BEN: You know, someday,

1247
01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.480
you're gonna have to tell me
how you guys all got teamed up.

1248
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.400
Actually, Mal promised to let
all the kids off the Isle

1249
01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.200
-once this is over.
-Mal?

1250
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.600
I have
to tell you guys something.

1251
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.040
Um... (SIGHS)

1252
01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.360
I lied to you.

1253
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.400
The kids won't be coming off
the Isle.

1254
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.960
-What do you mean?
-The program is shut down.

1255
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.840
And the barrier...

1256
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.040
will be closed for good.

1257
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.880
-(HOOK GRUNTS)
-For Auradon's safety.

1258
01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.360
Hold up.

1259
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.080
So we're saving
your precious people

1260
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.640
and your behinds for a lie.

1261
01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.520
I knew it was a mistake
to trust you.

1262
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.560
You're always out for yourself.

1263
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.840
And you, King Benny...

1264
01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.080
you're probably just gonna throw
us all back inside.

1265
01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.200
You know what?

1266
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.520
I actually thought
you were brave.

1267
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.560
You're nothing but a chicken.

1268
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.560
Too scared to tell me
I was never gonna see

1269
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.360
-my dad again.
-Celia.

1270
01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.760
Celia. Celia, no!

1271
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.600
-EVIE: Celia!
-No! No.

1272
01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.040
Regain your might and ignite!

1273
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.920
No...

1274
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.360
Regain your might and ignite!

1275
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.960
Bummer.

1276
01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.240
Let's go find Gil
and leave them all to rot.

1277
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.800
No.

1278
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400
Uh...

1279
01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.480
Uma!

1280
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520
Evie...

1281
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.000
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.080
I'm sorry, I just...
I thought that...

1283
01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.800
I was afraid to tell you.
I thought I was gonna

1284
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.280
lose my best friend.

1285
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.800
But I had to do something.
I had to protect Auradon.

1286
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.360
Closing the barrier
was your idea?

1287
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.000
I did it for us.

1288
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.840
I did it for our life
that we have here now.

1289
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.080
For our life?

1290
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.480
What about the kids that
we left behind on that island?

1291
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.120
The kids that we promised?

1292
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.720
We were their only hope.

1293
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.720
I thought you were gonna
stand up for the V.K.'s.

1294
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.560
But instead, you lied to them.

1295
01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.120
And you lied to Jay.

1296
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.160
And you lied to Carlos.

1297
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.120
And you lied to me.

1298
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.400
We're your family.

1299
01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640
Evie.

1300
01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.480
Evie, come on. I had no choice!

1301
01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.000
No.

1307
