NARRATOR:
May, 1 942.

5
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,791
As the spring
campaigning season opens,

6
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:45,495
the Red Army's victories of late 1 94 1
seem suddenly meaningless,

7
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,042
and Hitler's damaged confidence
receives a massive boost.

8
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,081
The hasty Soviet attack
in the south against Kharkov

9
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:59,208
is swallowed up
by a German counteroffensive.

10
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,283
Hundreds of thousands
of Soviet troops are captured,

11
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,827
destined for Nazi prison camps.

12
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,154
These are losses
the Red Army can ill afford.

13
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,800
Because Kharkov will become
the springboard

14
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,106
for Hitler's own summer assault
on the Caucasus.

15
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,939
The FÃ¼hrer is confident now,

16
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:34,008
certain that the Wehrmacht
can seize the vital oil centers

17
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,417
of Grozny and Baku.

18
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,923
And from late June,

19
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,858
his armies sweep south
into mountain country.

20
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,969
But Stalin has concentrated
Red Army reserves

21
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,230
to protect Moscow,

22
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,034
and the offensive
takes it by surprise.

23
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:01,746
lt is hurled into hasty retreat,
seeking refuge in the hills,

24
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:07,382
able only to sabotage the precious
oil fields it leaves behind.

25
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,857
And as German units advance,

26
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,426
there are some who greet them
as liberators,

27
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,190
entrusting nationalist dreams
to these new masters.

28
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,632
They will learn the tragic truth
soon enough.

29
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,568
But as it retreats and regroups,

30
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,806
the Red Army becomes stronger
and more coherent.

31
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,816
And the rolling thunder
of the Panzers, at first unstoppable,

32
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,716
is silenced by stubborn defense

33
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,325
on the only road
through the mountains to Baku.

34
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,592
But though the great refineries

35
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,629
are still working
for the Soviet people,

36
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,893
a new peril looms.

37
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,200
Two smaller German armies
have been advancing slowly east

38
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,070
towards the industrial city
of Stalingrad.

39
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,110
As Hitler's ambitions
are thwarted further south,

40
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:09,204
he sees a chance to cut all links
between Moscow and the Caucasus.

41
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:14,218
The city on the Volga
becomes his new prime target.

42
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,159
The vaunted German Sixth Army,
conqueror of Paris in 1 940,

43
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,630
spearheads the drive,

44
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,997
and again
the Red Army tumbles back.

45
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,777
For Soviet soldiers,
this could so easily be the end.

46
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,507
Even Stalin's son
has been captured,

47
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,677
and his image
on propaganda leaflets

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,985
adds credence to German claims
of imminent victory.

49
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,029
But Stalin will tolerate
no more rapid retreats,

50
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:09,097
and on the brink of catastrophe,
he resorts, as always, to terror.

51
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,942
Stalin's secret Order Number 22 7,

52
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,914
issued under his signature
in late July, 1 942.

53
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,379
This notorious document

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,151
makes any unauthorized retreat
punishable by death.

55
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,418
''Not one step back.''

56
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,896
Stalin means it literally.

57
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,489
And this unique footage

58
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,593
shows NKVD troops
putting his edict into practice.

59
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,470
They're known as blocking units.

60
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,440
Deployed just behind the troops,

61
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,642
they pass instant sentence
on any who disobey Order 22 7.

62
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,709
And the blocking troops themselves?

63
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,053
ln Stalin's world, almost anybody
can become a law enforcer --

64
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,685
young and old conscripts,
national minorities,

65
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,389
NKVD personnel.

66
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,363
And some blocking units can boast

67
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,595
an extraordinary collection
of talents.

68
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:15,400

fought with them and knew them well.

lNTERPRETER:
The troops went into battle.

71
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,943
We were following them.

72
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,509
We were about 500 meters
behind them.

73
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,750
No one could turn and run back.

74
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:36,522
lf someone did, he would be shot
on the spot by our blocking units

75
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,395
or arrested
by the special division of NKVD.

76
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,532
l had the carbine.

77
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:49,370
And then my friends got a pistol
for me, and l threw away the carbine.

78
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,578
These Siberians were quite old.

79
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,980
Our blocking unit
was made up of Siberians,

80
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:04,250
former convicts who had robbed
banks and large factories.

81
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:11,690
They were serious criminals,
but they treated me well.

82
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:17,299
NARRATOR: Appropriate purveyors
of Stalin's bitter medicine,

enforcing the Supreme Commander's
will without hesitation or mercy.

84
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,670
And Stalin has introduced
another grim aid to discipline --

85
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,272
penal battalions.

86
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,423
Each of these convicts must serve
in the penal unit for three months,

87
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,153
not a day more,

88
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,027
but for many,
that will be too long.

89
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,502
Even petty transgressors --

90
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,199
pilferers, shirkers,
anyone who upsets an officer --

91
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,836
have reason to fear
the Red Army's field tribunals.

92
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:07,142
Guilty is always
their favorite verdict.

93
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,389
And the inevitable transfer
to penal service

94
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,983
is virtually a death sentence.

95
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,530
They are the first thrown
into every hopeless fight,

96
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,330
the first to face
every deadly firestorm.

97
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:30,098
Yet, they often fight well
and with rare commitment.

98
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,142
Soldiers with something to prove,
terrified, of course,

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,689
but desperate to wipe away
the stigma of their misdoings.

100
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,103
A battle wound is enough
to earn release.

101
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,834
But each casualty is carefully
examined by security officers

102
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,376
in case the damage
should be self-inflicted

103
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,641
or the work of blocking units.

104
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,552
The genuinely wounded will find
the forgiving words

105
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,521
''atoned with his own blood''
added to their records.

106
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,420
And the dead are granted
the same consolation,

107
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,325
though in life they are expendable.

108
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,560
True cannon fodder, their combat
achievements with penal units

109
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,159
are ignored by official records.

110
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,164
That policy still outrages
former Red Air Force pilot,

111
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,435
Artyom Anfinogenov.

112
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,974
lNTERPRETER: The pilots

113
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,136
from the penal squadrons were

114
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,838
sent on the most dangerous missions,

115
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,939
most important of all,
river crossings,

116
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,644
which were fundamental in deciding
the outcome of Stalingrad,

117
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,755
then to attack airfields
and large concentrations of tanks,

118
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,348
the three types of missions that
the penal squadrons were sent on.

119
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,485
But they were given
no official recognition

120
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,086
for these combat missions.

121
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,688
Normally, a pilot
would carry out a combat mission,

122
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,496
and normally, for each one,
he would get a credit.

123
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,230
For ground-attack squadrons,

124
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,772
it was the number of combat missions
that you undertook

125
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,170
that was important.

126
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,765
Fighter pilots would get a credit

127
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,572
for every dogfight
and enemy aircraft shot down.

128
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,704
But ground-attack pilots
would get a credit

129
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,442
for every combat mission,

130
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,316
and this would all count
towards the pilot's war record.

131
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,117
But the penal squadrons were not
credited with their combat missions,

132
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,352
so you would fly, you would fight,
you would hit the Germans,

133
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,054
but you would not get credit for it
until you were eventually wounded

134
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,257
or until the commander might
eventually judge

135
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,925
that you had served your term.

136
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,738
NARRATOR:
And for any pilot in action,

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,240
the first wound is usually the last.

138
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,468
They may be forgiven for thinking

139
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,515
that capture is the safest way
out of this war.

140
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:02,385
But though it is merciless, arbitrary,
and utterly dehumanizing,

141
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,690
Stalin's program
of unbending oppression

142
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,493
does galvanize the Red Army.

143
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,737
Suren Mirzoyan was a commando
with the 62nd Army

144
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,931
defending Stalingrad.

145
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,510
lNTERPRETER:
Some people think that Order 22 7

146
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,047
was a criminal order.

147
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,744
No! lt was vital
to the country's defense.

148
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,548
lt was an important,
galvanizing factor.

149
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,418
lf there hadn't been that order,

150
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,391
those in retreat who'd already
got used to falling back

151
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,858
would have continued.

152
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,054
But where could they go?

153
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,792
Stalin was right when he said
that beyond the Volga

154
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,460
there was nowhere further
for us to retreat.

155
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,436
One time, when they tried to capture
one of our commanders,

156
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,599
he stood up in the trench,
just stood there in the trench,

157
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,734
and showed them what he had.

158
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,404
He was a soldier.
But he was surrounded.

159
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,540
He was out of ammunition,
grenades, everything,

160
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,084
because he had spent it all.

161
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:04,680
So he got up, and
in an act of supreme defiance,

162
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,258
he pulled down his trousers
and said,

163
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,860
''Here, come and take this prisoner!''

164
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,834
NARRATOR:
But defiance alone

165
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,805
will not keep the enemy
out of Stalingrad.

166
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,071
By late August, they are
at the Volga to the north,

167
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,011
and the city is all but surrounded.

168
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,819
Hitler is proclaiming
a great triumph of arms.

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,321
German victory medals
have been struck.

170
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,884
And at first, Stalingrad
seems there for the taking.

171
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,361
But this is Stalin's city,

172
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,199
the very symbol
of his personal prestige,

173
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,830
and that is something
even women and children

174
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,774

343
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,700
urgently called a fighter-plane
squadron to chase them off

344
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,900
and cover our infantry troops.

345
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,772
A squadron of seven planes --

346
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,540
l don't want to mention the squadron
captain's name -- took off,

347
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,844
and with an armada of German
bombers flying towards them,

348
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:50,479
they evaded the fighting,
turned off, and flew up the Volga.

349
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,456
Khryukin immediately ordered
the captain to be shot,

350
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,288
and as l read later in the official
report about the execution,

351
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,659
all the other pilots were sent
to the penal squadron.

352
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:04,133
l'll tell you, the aircraft losses
at Stalingrad were terrible.

353
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,204
Just terrible.

354
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,363
An average air-force regiment
might be at the front for a week

355
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,237
and then cease to exist.

356
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,335
That gives you some idea
how bad our losses were.

357
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,743
And the reasons --

358
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,407
Well, first and foremost,
the enormous intensity

359
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,111
and the importance
of the actual struggle itself.

360
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:26,623
Ultimately, it was a question of life
or death for our country and people.

361
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,626
On the other hand, everything was
thrown into it like into a furnace,

362
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,628
whether our regiment
was ready or not.

363
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,960
A hole in the line had to be filled,

364
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,761
so pilots like me
made up 1 00 regiments

365
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,428
consisting entirely of sergeants.

366
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,529
l was a sergeant, you understand.

367
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,541
1 00 regiments of sergeants
were given crash training

368
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,937
just before the war.

369
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,741
80o<i>/</i>o of them were at Stalingrad.

370
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,783
One fine day, just after we had
finished the summer course

371
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,047
at the pilot-training camp
in the Urals near Perm,

372
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:00,614
they drew up all graduated pilots
in ranks and gave a command.

373
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,626
All those with names
beginning with the letters ''A'' to ''K''

374
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,528
were to turn right and march
quickly back to the barracks.

375
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,567
And those beginning
with ''L'' to ''Z'' had to turn left

376
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,796
and quick march
to the quartermaster's stores

377
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,895
and from there
immediately go and join

378
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:18,271
the infantry troops at Stalingrad.

379
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,537
Thus it was that they sent
trained pilots

380
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,808
off to join the infantry
at Stalingrad.

381
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:27,681
And those pilots whose names
began with the letters ''A'' to ''K,''

382
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,085
with me among them,
because my name is Anfinogenov,

383
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,349
flew to the front.

384
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,617
So l flew to the front

385
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:38,788
with a grand total of just 3 hours,
40 minutes training in all.

386
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,101
NARRATOR:
Lydia Litvyak is a pilot

387
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,670
with one of three female
fighter groups in Stalingrad,

388
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,306
and a good one.

389
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,909
1 0 Luftwaffe aircraft have fallen
to her machine guns.

390
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,457
One more, and she will qualify
for the ultimate accolade,

391
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,823
Hero of the Soviet Union.

392
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,262
But then her lover,
flying with a neighboring squadron,

393
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,925
is killed,

394
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,438
and, as her brother recalls,
the loss destroys her.

395
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,335
lNTERPRETER: She used
to write us letters every day

396
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,810
on funny triangle-shaped
letter paper,

397
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,381
addressed to Mother in Europe.

398
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,474
ln the last letter, she wrote,

399
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:38,818
''Mother, l dreamt that l was standing
on the bank of a big, stormy river,

400
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:43,189
and my beloved Alyosha
was calling me from the other side.''

401
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:49,527
And Mother said,
''That's it. She is going to die.''

402
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,329
NARRATOR: And what
of the millions of Soviet citizens

403
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,771
away from the front line?

404
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,710
As propaganda fixes every eye
on the struggle for Stalingrad,

405
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,839
they respond
with whatever they can give --

406
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,917
their jewelry, their money,

407
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,785
anything to help preserve the lives
of husbands, brothers, and sons

408
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,550
trapped in the inferno.

409
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:23,131
They are all part of a monumental
national effort to save Stalingrad.

410
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,997
And at the heart
of the Soviet crusade,

411
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,537
hidden from Hitler's gaze,

412
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,642
one of the most astonishing
enterprises in the history of warfare.

413
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,402
Machinery and manpower

414
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:37,140
from the great industrial regions
of the western USSR

415
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,150
have been snatched
from the very jaws of Nazi invasion.

416
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,046
Now a vast migration east
is under way --

417
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,988
east, beyond the Urals,

418
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,958
where they plant explosives
in the frozen ground

419
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,055
and rebuild Soviet war production
from scratch.

420
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,662
They work fast
through the grueling winter,

421
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,703
but the motherland's need
is desperate,

422
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,174
and many plants must begin
operating before they have a roof.

423
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,103
By the end of the war,

424
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,616
more than 2,000 new factories
will have sprung up in Siberia,

425
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,949
heavy industrial plants

426
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,024
producing weapons to sustain
the Red Army at the front.

427
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,953
But that army needs men.

428
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,424
And so while Hitler still
keeps men away from the front

429
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,330
for vital factory work,

430
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,060
legions of Soviet children

431
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,765
must rise to aid their homeland
in its hour of peril.

432
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,468
Alongside their mothers
at the lathes,

433
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,545
they toil to complete
the Siberian miracle,

434
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,878
and the future of the Soviet Union
depends on them all --

435
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,617
on the quality of the war machines
they produce,

436
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,454
on the quantity of oil they extract,

437
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,295
and on the barges they pilot

438
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,423
to bring it all to the crisis point
on the Volga<i>. . .</i>

439
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,335
<i>. . .</i>to Stalingrad.

440
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,608
And Stalin, for once,
does not squander their endeavors.

441
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,237
The year's defeats
have shocked him,

442
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,544
and Marshal Zhukov finds
his first counterattack proposals

443
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,587
greeted
with uncharacteristic caution.

444
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,917
lNTERPRETER:
''So, what have you thought up?''

445
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,518
Stalin said as he came over
to our map.

446
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,999
''What front is that?''

447
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,430
Vasilievsky reported back,
''lt's a new front

448
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:44,065
that needs to be opened
in addition to the Don Front

449
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,473
so that we can make a major thrust

450
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,912
against the German grouping
at Stalingrad.

451
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,479
The left wing
of our Stalingrad Front

452
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:58,147
will make a thrust towards Kalach
to meet it.''

453
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:05,493
Stalin says, ''But have we got
enough forces

454
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,929
for such a big operation?

455
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:13,265
Perhaps we should limit it
to the thrust along the Don

456
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,239
from north to south<i>. . .</i>

457
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,844
<i>. . .</i>and south to north.''

458
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:29,647
We objected to Stalin
that if we were to do this,

459
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,383
the Germans would quickly deploy
their mechanized troops

460
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,981
from Stalingrad

461
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,221
and parry our thrust.

462
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,936
He said, ''We need to think
about our plan

463
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,303
and calculate
our forces and resources.

464
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,344
The main task now
is to hold Stalingrad,

465
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,745
and don't breathe a word
to anyone about the plan.''

466
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,880
NARRATOR: Nothing must distract
from the last-ditch battle

467
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:07,083
still being waged inside Stalingrad.

468
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,850
The city has become
a global obsession,

469
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,395
dominating the world's headlines.

470
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,226
And now, more than ever,

471
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,132
Stalin's prestige demands
that it shall not fall.

472
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,242
But there is another reason
to plan in stealth.

473
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,304
The 6th Army must be kept
fully occupied in Stalingrad

474
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,882
while the Red Army
gathers in the rear,

475
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,383
planning its revenge.

476
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,585
While the Soviet Union's
distant allies

477
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,157
beat paths of their own
to the beleaguered city,

478
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,424
British aid carried through the icy
gauntlet of the Murmansk run<i>. . .</i>

479
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,759
<i>. . .</i>or across the lranian border.

480
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,339
And from the USA's
Alaskan airfields,

481
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,311
fighter aircraft fly into Siberia

482
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,439
to aid a Red Army almost ready
to launch its counterstrike.

483
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,217
Artillery Chief Voronov
coordinates planning

484
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:14,017
along with General Vatutin,
leading the Southwest Front,

485
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,025
Rokossovsky,
commanding the Don Front,

486
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:23,623
and Eremenko, attended, as ever,
by his political shadow Khrushchev.

487
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,527
Their designs are overseen
by Stalin's

488
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:31,404
most trusted military advisers,
Zhukov and Vasilievsky.

489
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,240
And on the 1 9th of November,

490
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,804
a huge artillery barrage
by the Southwest Front

491
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,382
pierces the frost,

492
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,010
decimating ill-prepared
Romanian forces in its path.

493
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,117
This is Operation Uranus.

494
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,152
Vatutin's tanks burst through
almost at once.

495
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:10,280
And Eremenko's southern wing
surges forward on the next day.

496
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:18,051
The Wehrmacht, taken utterly
by surprise, cannot stop them.

497
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,183
And as its allies collapse
on the flanks,

498
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,955
there are no reserves to stem
the resurgent Red tide.

499
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,025
Within three days,

500
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,794
the Southwest Front
has taken Kalach,

501
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,770
some 80 kilometers
west of Stalingrad.

502
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,808
And on the 23rd of November,
a few miles southwest of Kalach,

503
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,042
its advance units meet up
with Eremenko's forces.

504
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,325
Suddenly, the German 6th Army
and the 4th Panzer Army,

505
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,259
perhaps 300,000
of Hitler's finest troops,

506
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:04,801
are surrounded inside Stalingrad.

507
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,569
The hunter has been captured
by his prey.

508
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,806
An astonished Hitler summons
Manstein, his troubleshooter,

509
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,140
to Stalingrad.

510
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,946
His sharp troops will breach
the Soviet ring surrounding the city

511
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,542
and secure the prize
Hitler's already promised

512
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,847
to the German people.

513
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,494
Two Soviet armies,
the 5 1st and 2nd Guards,

514
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,928
are rushed to meet
Manstein's relief force

515
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,124
and stop it dead in its tracks.

516
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,532
Former Artillery Sergeant Rasporkin
was with the guards.

517
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,573
lNTERPRETER: Three army corps
of around 400,000 soldiers

518
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,236
were immediately dispatched by foot.

519
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,746
We set up our field guns
as soon as we got there

520
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,338
without even digging in.

521
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,876
lt just wasn't possible to dig in.
There was no time.

522
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,184
Tanks were breaking
through our infantry lines.

523
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,554
l think attitudes and conditions
on both sides

524
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,992
became more and more
inhuman and extreme.

525
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:08,031
For example, there were
some marines who had been killed

526
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,463
and then crushed into the earth

527
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,367
by the same tanks
that had already annihilated them.

528
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,529
What could they possibly hope
to gain by crushing them

529
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,799
if they were already dead?

530
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,970
NARRATOR: The guards pay
a high price for stopping Manstein.

531
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,712
Almost two thirds of the army
is killed or wounded.

532
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,150
And even faced by Germany's
fearsome new Tiger tanks,

533
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,052
they fight like the elite units
they are.

534
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,826
lNTERPRETER: There were times
in the tank attacks

535
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,361
and artillery barrages

536
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:43,024
when l couldn't keep my teeth
together for days on end.

537
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,227
They were chattering so much
from fear.

538
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,897
Yes, from fear,
my teeth were chattering,

539
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,236
and there was no way
l could stop them.

540
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,368
On one occasion,
for two days, no less.

541
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,107
And when l knocked out a Tiger
in Gromoslavka, near Stalingrad,

542
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:03,654
l was so deafened,
l lost my power of speech.

543
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,848
We did not need
blocking units there,

544
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:12,589
because the guards,
they never stepped back.

545
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,021
And as far as l remember,

546
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:19,626
our 2nd Guards Army
didn't step back once.

547
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,669
NARRATOR:
There will be no relief now

548
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,138
for German troops in Stalingrad.

549
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,210
Hitler calls them his champions,

550
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,870
but his orders,
no escape and no surrender,

551
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,642
condemn them to death.

552
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:39,683
And now GÃ¶ring offers comfort
to the Reich's besieged heroes.

553
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:43,725
His Luftwaffe will fly
500 tons of supplies per day

554
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,762
into the Stalingrad pocket.

555
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:48,896
The Luftwaffe tries,

556
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,968
but the Red Army
brings up extra A.A. batteries,

557
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,161
and the lumbering
German transports

558
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,763
are blown out of the sky
in their hundreds.

559
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:06,376
Soon, even quotas of 50 tons
per day cannot be met.

560
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,249
And as the Red Army
closes the ring around Stalingrad,

561
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,686
advancing cautiously
through the snow,

562
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,624
taking time to bring up
heavy artillery and air support<i>. . .</i>

563
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,953
<i>. . .</i>German defenders,
shivering in the ruins,

564
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,726
are told to fight on,

565
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,566
sustained only by glib promises
of ultimate victory,

566
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,071
along with a little advice
from the FÃ¼hrer --

567
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,677
how to dig a hole in the snow.

568
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,508
Primitive diagrams

569
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,813
that almost mock these grizzled
veterans in their desperation.

570
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:47,856
And for frostbite, the FÃ¼hrer
recommends a bag over the face.

571
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,289
Yet, like Soviet troops before them,

572
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,521
they entertain no thought
of surrender.

573
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,868
And as they in turn cling to every
bloodstained remnant of the city,

574
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:03,406
icebound apocalypse
returns to Stalingrad.

575
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,841
German regimental commander
Steidl<i>. . .</i>

576
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,381
''The infantry has been living among
corpses for the last few weeks.

577
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,179
Corpses on the right.
Corpses on the left.

578
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,948
Corpses next to you.
Corpses under you.

579
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,114
And your rifle.''

580
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:30,060
lNTERPRETER: lf a bullet
is fired from 1 00 to 1 50 meters,

581
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,158
it won't go through a frozen body.

582
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:37,873
So we just piled them up and
then rested behind them

583
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,910
and took cover.

584
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,279
NARRATOR:
For ordinary soldiers on both sides,

585
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,047
this is the ghastly climax
to a long, dark journey.

586
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,187
lNTERPRETER: We even used
frozen bodies like stones or locks,

587
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,628
throwing them under the wheels
of a vehicle if it got bogged down.

588
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,962
The vehicles would then get
the necessary traction

589
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,298
and move on without a hitch.

590
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,701
Why did we do it?

591
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,568
Because they --

592
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,267
On one occasion,
we took back a village.

593
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,843
lt was beyond the Don.

594
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,003
The locals there told us
how many people

595
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,048
had been burned alive
by the Germans.

596
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,846
They had put all the young people
together in a barn,

597
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:27,185
covered it with dry hay,
and burned 30 or 40 of them.

598
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,158
So we thought,
''lf you burn people alive,

599
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,059
we will kill you,
we will destroy you.''

600
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,656
There could be no doubt that
these sort of atrocities took place.

601
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,863
You know, they did it absolutely
without any fear of God.

602
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,995
Yes, it's true.

603
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,338
When a vehicle was stuck,
we put one of their corpses under it.

604
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,742
l did it. We all did it.

605
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,677
And do you know why?

606
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,911
Because when l was in that barn
and saw the half-burnt bodies,

607
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,281
l was so furious.

608
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,515
l said, ''See what they've done
with our own people,

609
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,615
our own Don Cossacks.''

610
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,160
And l swore l would pay them back,

611
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,322
although it may have been
in a different kind.

612
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,094
But that incident
with the vehicle really happened,

613
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,362
and l'll never forget it.

614
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:19,138
NARRATOR: Yes, there is hatred
of the invader in Stalingrad.

615
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,104
And it burns ever deeper

616
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:25,649
as Soviet troops uncover evidence
of Nazi methods.

617
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,578
This camp held 2,000
of their captured comrades,

618
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:35,591
and by the time it is liberated,
only 20 are still alive.

619
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,791
And survivors tell
of brutal maltreatment,

620
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,989
of grotesque medical experiments.

621
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,803
ls it any wonder they thirst
for vengeance?

622
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,911
ln the heart of the cauldron,

623
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,517
Hitler's gladiators know now
that they are doomed.

624
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,884
And so, betrayed,

625
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:09,324
they evacuate a few casualties
on the last plane out of Stalingrad.

626
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,096
And with it go their last words
to families, lovers, friends.

627
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,277
''You should forget it, Marguerite,
and do it right away.

628
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,181
l know you want me beside you,
not only as a husband and a lover,

629
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,014
but as a pianist.

630
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,647
Marguerite, you should know
the whole truth.

631
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,851
l don't have my hands anymore,
not since December.

632
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,456
The little finger is missing
on my left hand,

633
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,964
but even worse,

634
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:53,002
frostbite took the middle three
fingers on my right hand.

635
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:57,506
l can only just about hold a mug
using the two fingers l have left.

636
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,067
And l have become rather helpless.

637
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,113
You don't understand how important
these things are until you lose them.

638
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:13,553
The only thing l can still do properly
is shoot using my little finger.

639
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,956
And l can't shoot all my life, right?

640
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,894
So my hands are useless.

641
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:24,525
Do you feel better now
that you know the whole truth?''

642
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:46,188
Ordinary victims resigned
to their fates<i>. . .</i>

643
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,718
<i>. . .</i>abandoned in Hades,

644
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,917
so that their FÃ¼hrer
might save face.

645
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:05,872
And when a Soviet proposal of terms
passed across the Romanian sector

646
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:10,207
offers them a chance
for honorable surrender,

647
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,748
Hitler snatches away the hope.

648
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,590
His stark order,
''Fight to the last bullet.''

649
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,937
But though they fight on,
the bullets are running out,

650
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:41,305
and the Red Army
is still coming at them.

651
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,476
By late January,
they're being overwhelmed,

652
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,347
and whole regiments are giving up
the hopeless struggle.

653
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,080
But as official cameraman
Orlyankin discovers,

654
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,652
every house in Stalingrad
is still a potential death trap.

655
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,192
[ Speaking Russian ]

656
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,698
lNTERPRETER: On the front
where the 1 3th Rodimtsev Division

657
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,664
was fighting,

658
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,895
there was a house,
a basement to be more precise,

659
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:11,566
where the Germans were
hiding and sniping at us.

660
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,939
lf they saw one of our lads,
they would immediately shoot him.

661
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,809
Well, what happened was this.

662
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,681
Suddenly one of these Fritzes
came running out with a white shirt

663
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,754
and runs towards us
along the basement windows.

664
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:28,518
So the Fritzes were surrendering
like Antioch.

665
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,025
And so our boys moved slowly
into the open

666
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,891
from out of their trenches
and shelters

667
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,397
because of the white flag.

668
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:46,168
And at that moment,
just as l was about to start filming,

669
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,642
they opened up
with a terrifying burst

670
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,374
of machine-gun
and submachine-gun fire

671
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,542
coming from almost
all the windows of the building,

672
00:45:54,651 --> 00:46:00,112
and our lads, who had only broken
cover in order to take these POWs.

673
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,555
That was a law, you see.

674
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,786
lf they surrendered,
we had to accept them.

675
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:08,126
And so our soldiers started falling,

676
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,732
some dead, some wounded,

677
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:14,167
some just trying to avoid the bullets.

678
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,307
NARRATOR:
Finally, on February the 2nd,

679
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:22,071
the last German troops fighting
in Stalingrad surrender.

680
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,151
After five long months,

681
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:36,056
a battle that began
almost by accident is over.

682
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:43,089
But 6th Army commander Paulus
is not among them.

683
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:50,900
Historian and wartime
intelligence officer Lev Bezymensky.

684
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,872
[ Speaking Russian ]

685
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,382
lNTERPRETER:
When they started to bring in

686
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,008
the first captured generals,

687
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,519
no one in our reconnaissance unit

688
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:10,218
was 1 00o<i>/</i>o sure whether Paulus
was alive or dead.

689
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,654
There was a possibility

690
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:16,028
that he might have been rescued
at the last moment.

691
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:20,229
ln theory, it would have been possible
to get him out of Stalingrad,

692
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,500
but in practice, no.

693
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:27,006
So l became a human bug.

694
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,600
You see, in those days,

695
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,944
we did not have the technical
listening equipment we have now.

696
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,747
So yours truly
was put in a German uniform

697
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,482
and made to bunk down
in the same prison dormitory

698
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,718
as the captured German generals.

699
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,420
l had to listen
to what they were saying,

700
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:50,523
especially in case one of them
started talking about Paulus.

701
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,694
l lay there with my face to the wall

702
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,501
because l was afraid
they might have recognized me.

703
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:02,807
You see, l had dealt with them
when they had first been captured.

704
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,814
So l just lay there and listened.

705
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,083
Suddenly l heard them
talking about him,

706
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,986
although they didn't
use his name specifically.

707
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:19,222
There's a German title, ''Ober,''
which means ''commander in chief.''

708
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,522
They were saying
that the Ober had said something

709
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:27,866
and that he was here
and that he was still here.

710
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,965
So l concluded that Paulus
was still in Stalingrad.

711
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:36,544
NARRATOR: And when Paulus,
instructed by Hitler to kill himself,

712
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,309
is captured in the basement
of a city store,

713
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,352
Stalin uses him as Hitler had done --
for propaganda.

714
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,156
But though he is berated
before the world's press,

715
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,129
Paulus tells no bitter tales
of treachery,

716
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,293
just name, rank, and serial number.

717
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,636
Along with their commander,

718
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,473
some 9 1 ,000 German survivors
have surrendered.

719
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,347
They have all been Hitler's victims,

720
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,681
and now they are destined
to suffer at Stalin's hands.

721
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,723
For the dictators, roles
have been reversed since Kharkov.

722
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,830
Now, as Hitler counts
the massive cost

723
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,599
of his obsession with Stalin's city,

724
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:41,210
the Soviet leader gloats
over pictures of captured generals.

725
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,470
But if Stalin, like his enemy,

726
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,277
believes that film is the key
to posterity's blessing,

727
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,749
he is wrong.

728
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,721
The Wehrmacht will never again
trespass so far to the east,

729
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:02,527
and the victory marks a turning point
in the fortunes of the Soviet Union.

730
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,994
But the great monument
by the Volga

731
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,437
belongs not to men of destiny,
nor to tyrants,

732
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,805
but to ordinary men and women.

733
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,345
She is the motherland.

734
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,346
But she is a mother, too.

735
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,143
Her cry is victory

736
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,880
but also passionate grief
for her children,

737
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,319
for the gladiators,

738
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:33,795
hurled by uncaring despots
into the abyss of Stalingrad.
