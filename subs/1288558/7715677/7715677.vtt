00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:04.749
Shhh! Shhh!

2
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.087
We caught the bitch!

3
00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:27.688
Please don't hurt me.

4
00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.487
Who are you?

5
00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:44.747
Somebody please, help me.

6
00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.920
Please. I just want to go home.

7
00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:56.050
Please. I just want to go home.

8
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.852
Daddy?

9
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:11.357
Daddy, why are you doing this to me?

10
00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.443
- Who are these people?
- Look, they're good people.

11
00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.613
They're--they're here to help.

12
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.450
What are you talking about? Where's Mom?

13
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.621
Mommy's dead, baby. You know that.

14
00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.336
You killed her.

15
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.338
- What?
- You did.

16
00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:39.885
No. Why are you saying these things?
Daddy, please, I just want to go home.

17
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.515
I just want to go home.

18
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.230
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Daddy, what is that?

19
00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.441
No!

20
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:01.991
Daddy, Daddy, look at me. It's me.

21
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:10.708
I just want you to hold me
and take me home. Please.

22
00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:17.506
Please, stop.

23
00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:22.511
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.

24
00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:29.018
I'll rip your soul out, you pathetic fuck!

25
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.777
Motherfucker, I will kill you
like I killed your wife!

26
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.741
Fuck!

27
00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.420
I love you. baby.

28
00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:29.138
Hey. How's it going,
Mr. Hot Shit city boy?

29
00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.140
- Hey, Olivia.
- Come here.

30
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.434
Two arms, please, like you missed me.

31
00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:40.149
- This is my girl, Natalie.
- Oh, the heart breaker from your car shop.

32
00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.525
The doctor.

33
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.278
- Actually, she's--
- I'm a registered nurse.

34
00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.823
Nurse, right, sorry. That's--

35
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.117
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago, man.

36
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.369
And that's our irresistibly charming Eric.

37
00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:55.164
Teaching high school finally
turned you into a bitter old coot, huh?

38
00:06:55.331 --> 00:07:00.169
No, you did.
Kept us waiting here all morning.

39
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:02.838
Good to see you too, man. Come here.

40
00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:05.883
Look good.

41
00:07:07.134 --> 00:07:08.594
She's waiting for you in the back.

42
00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:11.513
Great.

43
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.071
Hey, Mia.

44
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:30.157
I'll be damned.

45
00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:33.702
You actually came.

46
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.997
Come on, I'm your big brother.
Of course I came.

47
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.667
I know I look like roadkill.

48
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.795
You look beautiful, as always.

49
00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:46.674
And you're a charming liar, as always.

50
00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:50.386
Grandpa?

51
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:55.516
Hey. Hey, there, buddy.

52
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.269
We always loved this place, didn't we?

53
00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.772
He missed you a lot, you know.

54
00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:06.902
- Oh, my God.
- What?

55
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.030
- What is that?
- What?

56
00:08:10.197 --> 00:08:11.740
Just this right here, what are you?

57
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.911
That's not funny.

58
00:08:17.538 --> 00:08:20.040
This is, uh,
it's made from a buckthorn tree.

59
00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:21.875
It's supposed to make your will stronger.

60
00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:24.086
But I thought you didn't
believe in that kind of stuff.

61
00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:27.464
I don't, but you do so, maybe it'll work.

62
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.135
Okay.

63
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:33.846
Well then, let's do this.

64
00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:42.646
Promise me
you'll stay with me until the end.

65
00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:44.940
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Cross your heart.

66
00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.651
Okay.

67
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.195
Hope to die.

68
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:55.242
Okay.

69
00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:59.913
May my friends
and family witness this act.

70
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.711
An irrevocable promise
to my commitment that...

71
00:09:08.672 --> 00:09:09.715
Fuck it.

72
00:09:13.927 --> 00:09:20.768
I promise not to touch this shit
ever again.

73
00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:26.565
Okay.

74
00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:29.818
Let's play cold turkey.

75
00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.368
Hopefully this still works.

76
00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:44.208
Wait.

77
00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:59.139
Looks like someone broke in.

78
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.184
Be careful.

79
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:14.905
What is that smell?

80
00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:20.661
Teenagers probably just broke in
here to drink beer, bump uglies.

81
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.204
Exactly.

82
00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.667
Mom would have hated
seeing the cabin like this.

83
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:28.085
Okay.

84
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.879
Let's make this place livable.

85
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:08.959
Hey.

86
00:11:11.503 --> 00:11:12.713
Are you okay?

87
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.842
Do you remember that lullaby
Mom used to sing us?

88
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.428
It was something like...

89
00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:25.267
"Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye.

90
00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.688
- Baby, little baby--"
- Mia, please.

91
00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.357
I don't think you need sad memories
in your head right now.

92
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.904
- Mom's not a sad one.
- You know what I mean.

93
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.368
You know in
our final days at the hospital,

94
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:47.748
Mom sometimes thought I was you.

95
00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.711
She even called me David
for a whole day once and

96
00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:57.799
- I played along, 'cause...
- Mia, look. I wanted to be there.

97
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.801
Okay? I did.

98
00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:04.389
By the time Mom got bad, I had just
gotten the job at the garage in Chicago.

99
00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.894
I don't know, I had I had a hard time
finding the right moment to come back.

100
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.689
And then it was too late, so...

101
00:12:16.693 --> 00:12:20.822
Maybe you were lucky.
Not to see her the way that I did.

102
00:12:54.898 --> 00:12:56.400
Looks like she's doing okay.

103
00:12:57.901 --> 00:12:59.528
David, there's something you need to know.

104
00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:03.907
Okay.

105
00:13:04.908 --> 00:13:07.202
We already tried this whole thing
back in Flint last summer.

106
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:10.872
Mia made the same promises.

107
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:15.043
She...took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety

108
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.962
before chucking her dope down the toilet.

109
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.047
She lasted eight hours and quit.

110
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:23.719
So we don't want to give her that chance
this time.

111
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.971
What do you mean?

112
00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:31.560
David, when she breaks,
and believe me, she will,

113
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.813
we don't wanna let her leave.

114
00:13:38.608 --> 00:13:42.321
What do you mean,
you wanna force her to stay here? Mia?

115
00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:46.116
This time, the only way
is the hard way, man.

116
00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:48.702
- She won't survive another OD.
- What?

117
00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:51.413
Mia ODed?

118
00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:53.790
She didn't just OD.

119
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:58.503
Legally, your sister died.
They had to defibrillate her.

120
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.593
Jesus.

121
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.264
Look, we all need to be together on this,
otherwise it won't work.

122
00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:14.936
I came here to make things
better with my sister, not worse.

123
00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:22.069
If she asks me to take her home
at some point, I'm gonna have to do it.

124
00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:24.863
Fuck!

125
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.824
I can't stand it! I can't stand it!

126
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.243
- What smell? What smell?
- I can't stand it!

127
00:14:30.577 --> 00:14:32.496
What the fuck is that smell?

128
00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:35.499
I know, I know.

129
00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:40.379
I can't stand
that fucking smell anymore!

130
00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:42.839
Lie down, okay?

131
00:14:43.006 --> 00:14:44.758
We're here for you. I know, I know.

132
00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:50.180
We're all here. We're all here.

133
00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.225
We're not going anywhere.

134
00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:03.193
Withdrawal's kicking in hard.

135
00:15:03.735 --> 00:15:05.654
This should help you
get through the night.

136
00:15:06.863 --> 00:15:09.408
I don't know
what is wrong with you people,

137
00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:12.994
but there is something dead and it reeks.

138
00:15:13.453 --> 00:15:17.165
- But there's no smell.
- You're just extra sensitive right now.

139
00:15:17.332 --> 00:15:20.335
I just can't stand
that fucking smell anymore.

140
00:15:23.296 --> 00:15:24.423
Wait.

141
00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:35.892
Oh, is that blood?

142
00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.080
What's your medical diagnosis now?

143
00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:00.041
It fucking stinks.

144
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:02.794
Shit, careful.

145
00:16:03.336 --> 00:16:04.838
These steps are old and rotten.

146
00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:07.174
Yeah,
like this whole freaking house.

147
00:16:18.393 --> 00:16:19.936
Smells like burnt hair.

148
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:22.856
I think it's back there.

149
00:16:45.837 --> 00:16:47.422
Oh my God.

150
00:16:54.804 --> 00:16:59.017
- What is this?
- I don't--I don't know. Witchcraft?

151
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:01.102
Who would do this?

152
00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.567
Something burned here.

153
00:17:10.987 --> 00:17:11.988
Look.

154
00:17:17.035 --> 00:17:20.372
Shit man, what the fuck happened here?

155
00:17:21.164 --> 00:17:23.208
Let's not go crazy over this, okay?

156
00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.460
I'll bury those dead cats
out back later.

157
00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:26.711
Yeah.

158
00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:29.881
- Smell'll be gone in no time.
- Yeah, okay.

159
00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:33.843
And what about
the voodoo shit they did down there?

160
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.597
No, no, no, no. Voodoo is
more about dolls, personal artifacts.

161
00:17:37.764 --> 00:17:40.308
- This is something different.
- Eric. That's enough.

162
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.063
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

163
00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:53.692
<i>"Naturom Demon to."”</i>

164
00:19:54.025 --> 00:19:56.986
<i>Leave this book...</i>

165
00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:01.783
<i>He is watching.</i>

166
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.541
<i>Shatter their bones,
they deserve it.</i>

167
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.257
<i>Don't say it, don't...</i>

168
00:20:41.322 --> 00:20:42.323
<i>"Kunda."</i>

169
00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.582
<i>"Astratta."</i>

170
00:20:56.212 --> 00:20:57.797
<i>"Montosse."</i>

171
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.221
<i>"Canda."</i>

172
00:21:17.692 --> 00:21:19.027
Please, God.

173
00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:21.112
Give me a break.

174
00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:43.468
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry,

175
00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.845
but I have to get out of here right now.

176
00:21:46.763 --> 00:21:48.306
No, come on, slumber party isn't over yet.

177
00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.642
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?

178
00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.268
Mia, please, look, Mia--

179
00:21:52.435 --> 00:21:57.649
I'm going insane here.
Olivia, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

180
00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:00.068
Mia, what is it?

181
00:22:02.862 --> 00:22:07.158
I will go through with this, okay?
I just, I can't do it here.

182
00:22:07.575 --> 00:22:08.701
Mia.

183
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.372
We've decided
we're not gonna take you back.

184
00:22:16.459 --> 00:22:18.044
We can't lose you again.

185
00:22:18.753 --> 00:22:20.421
You're gonna have to stick it out
this time.

186
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.468
David, drive me home.

187
00:22:29.764 --> 00:22:31.266
Come on, David.

188
00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.684
Mia.

189
00:22:33.476 --> 00:22:34.936
Maybe they're right.

190
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.775
You were supposed to be here
to support me.

191
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.152
- Not them.
- I'm here for you, Mia,

192
00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.821
- that's why I can't--
- Oh, my God.

193
00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:51.911
I am such an idiot to think for once
in my life I could count on you.

194
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:57.000
Mia, we're just trying to help you.

195
00:22:57.166 --> 00:22:59.419
Yeah, well, fuck you very much.

196
00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:07.468
Eric, leave her alone.

197
00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:09.470
Mia.

198
00:23:22.817 --> 00:23:24.235
Mia!

199
00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:28.114
Perfect.

200
00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:32.493
Fuck this, fuck, fuck, fuck!

201
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.079
Fuck. Fuck!

202
00:23:36.831 --> 00:23:40.335
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

203
00:25:24.063 --> 00:25:25.148
Mia!

204
00:25:28.651 --> 00:25:29.986
- Mia!
- Mia!

205
00:25:39.287 --> 00:25:40.288
Mia!

206
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.267
Mia.

207
00:27:35.027 --> 00:27:36.154
Mia!

208
00:27:36.487 --> 00:27:37.738
Mia!

209
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.657
- Mia!
- Mia!

210
00:27:43.327 --> 00:27:44.787
- Mia!
- Shit.

211
00:27:48.124 --> 00:27:49.417
Oh, my God.

212
00:27:59.594 --> 00:28:00.928
Hey, how's she doing?

213
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:06.392
Um, she's talking about a woman in
the woods. How the force attacked her.

214
00:28:07.518 --> 00:28:09.645
I don't know,
it's just crazy withdrawal talk.

215
00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:11.689
Well, don't you think we should take her
to a hospital?

216
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.316
I feel like we're in over our heads here.

217
00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:18.070
Okay, I am giving her the exact same
treatment she would get at a hospital.

218
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.327
If we leave now, all of this mess
will have been for nothing.

219
00:28:24.827 --> 00:28:27.163
Okay, what about the wounds on her arms?

220
00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:30.708
I pulled some thorns out.

221
00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:33.169
It looks like she might have
run into a thorn bush out there.

222
00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:35.588
She probably did it on purpose.

223
00:28:36.964 --> 00:28:37.965
What?

224
00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.635
David.

225
00:28:41.677 --> 00:28:44.513
From now on, she is gonna do
whatever it takes to get out of here.

226
00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:04.325
Mia.

227
00:29:06.452 --> 00:29:09.956
Listen, you gotta get out of those
clothes. All right? Take a shower.

228
00:29:10.122 --> 00:29:11.123
David.

229
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.085
Please.

230
00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:16.462
Please.

231
00:29:18.172 --> 00:29:23.552
You have to get me out of here.

232
00:29:26.722 --> 00:29:28.933
Mia, nobody said this was gonna be easy.

233
00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:30.184
No.

234
00:29:33.145 --> 00:29:34.939
You don't understand.

235
00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:38.776
There was something in the woods, David.

236
00:29:43.572 --> 00:29:50.496
And I think it's in here with us now.

237
00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:53.249
With me in the room?

238
00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:10.391
Look you know, it's all in your head.

239
00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.102
Just try to get it together.

240
00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:19.442
You'll feel better tomorrow, okay?
You'll be glad we were such assholes.

241
00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:24.196
Okay.

242
00:31:02.068 --> 00:31:03.486
Eric, what are you doing?

243
00:31:04.236 --> 00:31:05.946
Please, would you just
get rid of that thing?

244
00:31:06.113 --> 00:31:08.866
You should be downstairs
helping your friend clean up that mess.

245
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.952
I don't know who you're talking about.

246
00:31:12.828 --> 00:31:16.916
Come on, don't act like
you don't care about him. I know you do.

247
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.336
Well, I think we can all agree
he hasn't cared about us

248
00:31:20.503 --> 00:31:23.172
for the past freaking century.

249
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.883
Well, he's here now.

250
00:31:28.552 --> 00:31:29.678
Yeah.

251
00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.014
Truly amazing.

252
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.257
Grandpa.

253
00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:13.139
Grandpa!

254
00:32:19.895 --> 00:32:22.898
Grandpa. Come here, boy.

255
00:32:24.066 --> 00:32:25.067
Fuck.

256
00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.370
Grandpa.

257
00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:39.957
No, no, no.

258
00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:43.210
Hey, boy. Come on, boy.

259
00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:52.761
What did you get into?

260
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.681
Fuck.

261
00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:58.684
What happened?

262
00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:21.707
- Mia?
- She's in the shower.

263
00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:25.044
What happened? David?

264
00:33:27.546 --> 00:33:28.756
Mia.

265
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.342
Mia, open the door.

266
00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:36.639
Mia, open the door.

267
00:33:37.473 --> 00:33:39.183
- Mia, open the door!
- David.

268
00:33:42.978 --> 00:33:44.897
David, stop!
Tell me what's going on.

269
00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:47.983
Mia! Mia, open the fucking door!

270
00:33:53.113 --> 00:33:55.282
Mia!

271
00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.826
- Mia, open the fucking door!
- David!

272
00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:01.622
- David.
- David!

273
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:03.874
David!

274
00:34:04.291 --> 00:34:06.502
Mia!

275
00:34:10.422 --> 00:34:11.507
Mia.

276
00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:14.218
Mia!

277
00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:18.556
Olivia!

278
00:34:20.474 --> 00:34:21.976
Holy shit!

279
00:34:22.142 --> 00:34:23.394
Mia!

280
00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:39.034
This is insane.

281
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.168
Fuck, where is it?

282
00:35:14.778 --> 00:35:16.238
This can't be happening.

283
00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:46.268
I, um, I...I gave her a sedative so
she should be out for a couple of hours.

284
00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:52.775
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

285
00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.652
This is so wrong.

286
00:35:54.943 --> 00:35:57.112
Well, nobody could have known
she would do something so twisted.

287
00:35:57.279 --> 00:35:58.822
No, you should have known.

288
00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:01.492
We've all been following
your lead since we got here.

289
00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:05.579
- We should have left when Mia wanted to.
- Baby, please.

290
00:36:05.996 --> 00:36:08.624
Okay, let's not lose our heads. Okay?

291
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.959
With any luck,
it'll stop raining in a couple of hours,

292
00:36:11.126 --> 00:36:13.712
and we'll be able to cross the creek
in the morning and take her to a hospital.

293
00:36:14.546 --> 00:36:16.632
Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

294
00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:20.010
"Everything's gonna be fine"?

295
00:36:21.428 --> 00:36:23.055
Everything's gonna be fine.

296
00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:29.061
I don't know if you've noticed this,
but--but nothing has been fine.

297
00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:33.065
And everything's been getting worse
every second.

298
00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:40.197
Mia?

299
00:36:48.622 --> 00:36:49.623
Mia?

300
00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:52.668
What are you doing?

301
00:36:57.172 --> 00:36:58.716
Mia, put the gun down.

302
00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:01.760
Put the gun down, please.

303
00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:08.392
Mia!

304
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.770
Put the fucking gun down!

305
00:37:19.862 --> 00:37:20.988
You will die!

306
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:27.369
One by one we will take you!

307
00:37:30.497 --> 00:37:32.458
You are all going to die tonight.

308
00:37:37.296 --> 00:37:39.715
Get the gun. The gun, quick!

309
00:37:40.632 --> 00:37:41.925
Baby?

310
00:38:01.528 --> 00:38:02.571
Mia!

311
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.043
Let me out!

312
00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.421
- She's totally psychotic.
- My God, what happened to her eyes?

313
00:38:30.098 --> 00:38:31.975
What's she doing?

314
00:38:32.142 --> 00:38:33.602
Sounds like she's hitting herself
against something.

315
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.687
This is impossible.

316
00:38:35.979 --> 00:38:37.940
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep.

317
00:38:38.106 --> 00:38:39.650
You can give her another shot.

318
00:38:41.568 --> 00:38:42.736
That could put her into a coma.

319
00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:45.155
For Christ's sakes, Olivia,
she's gonna kill herself down there.

320
00:38:47.115 --> 00:38:48.116
Go get the shot.

321
00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:51.829
I got to get the shrapnel out of my arm.

322
00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:54.957
I have tweezers in my purse.

323
00:38:55.707 --> 00:38:57.668
David, listen to me.

324
00:38:58.085 --> 00:39:01.213
I--I--I don't think
a tranquilizer is gonna do shit.

325
00:39:02.464 --> 00:39:04.842
Because I don't think we're
dealing with a freaking panic attack here.

326
00:39:06.051 --> 00:39:08.262
I'm scared that what's happening
to Mia has something to do with

327
00:39:08.428 --> 00:39:10.180
the fucking witchcraft in the basement.

328
00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:36.099
Olivia?

329
00:40:45.108 --> 00:40:46.443
Olivia?

330
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:10.550
Olivia.

331
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.178
Are you okay?

332
00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.853
Olivia?

333
00:41:44.042 --> 00:41:47.295
Olivia? What are you doing in there?

334
00:41:51.216 --> 00:41:52.259
Olivia?

335
00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:56.972
Olivia.

336
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.602
Are you okay?

337
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:08.942
Oh, my God!

338
00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.737
Why the fuck did you do that?

339
00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:31.566
She tried to kill me.
She was trying to kill me.

340
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:54.589
Hold that, you got it?

341
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:07.978
Hold it there. Okay? Hold it.

342
00:44:08.728 --> 00:44:09.896
Fuck it.

343
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.317
David.

344
00:44:15.277 --> 00:44:17.320
I did something terrible.

345
00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.115
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.

346
00:44:20.282 --> 00:44:23.160
That thing I killed was not Olivia.

347
00:44:23.326 --> 00:44:24.786
He's losing too much blood.

348
00:44:24.953 --> 00:44:29.249
Baby, he needs water and sugar.
Okay? Go. Go!

349
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:30.876
Okay.

350
00:44:34.462 --> 00:44:36.006
- All right.
- David.

351
00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:40.177
I read a passage from that book

352
00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:43.263
and it was some sort of prayer.

353
00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:46.808
I released something, David.

354
00:44:48.977 --> 00:44:52.272
I released something evil.

355
00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.335
Natalie?

356
00:46:04.386 --> 00:46:05.512
Mia?

357
00:46:07.138 --> 00:46:08.139
Natalie?

358
00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.521
What am I doing down here?

359
00:46:17.565 --> 00:46:19.150
My leg hurts.

360
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.404
I can't move.

361
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.493
I'm gonna come down there, okay?

362
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.373
Why did you lock me down here?

363
00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:36.126
You were supposed to help me.

364
00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:39.421
Hey, we're trying to help, okay?

365
00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:42.882
You were out of control, you know?

366
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:46.094
You got violent and
we didn't know what else to do.

367
00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:48.263
Mia.

368
00:46:49.347 --> 00:46:51.224
Look, something really terrible
has happened

369
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:53.018
and we have to get out of here now, okay?

370
00:46:53.184 --> 00:46:55.770
You don't understand.

371
00:46:56.563 --> 00:46:58.315
He's not going to let you leave!

372
00:46:59.607 --> 00:47:01.401
And he's not gonna stop till he has you.

373
00:47:02.944 --> 00:47:04.487
Until he has all of you!

374
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:11.971
Please.

375
00:48:16.726 --> 00:48:19.229
I can smell your filthy soul.

376
00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:48.007
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

377
00:49:07.026 --> 00:49:09.612
Why don't you come down here
so I and suck your cock, pretty boy?

378
00:49:09.988 --> 00:49:10.989
Mia.

379
00:49:11.197 --> 00:49:12.866
Mia's not here, you fucking idiot!

380
00:49:14.909 --> 00:49:17.579
Your little sister's being raped in hell.

381
00:49:33.678 --> 00:49:35.388
I wanna go home.

382
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.323
Eric.

383
00:49:55.366 --> 00:49:57.869
I don't know why,
but I thought this would end it.

384
00:50:00.663 --> 00:50:03.458
But this book does not burn.

385
00:50:06.044 --> 00:50:08.004
It does not fucking burn.

386
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.551
Tell me what's going on here.

387
00:50:27.273 --> 00:50:30.860
This book uses some...

388
00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:37.867
ancient alphabet, there's some
translations, but just scattered notes.

389
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.828
They all refer to some...

390
00:50:42.413 --> 00:50:47.168
evil entity, uh, the Taker of Souls.

391
00:50:49.003 --> 00:50:50.129
Demon.

392
00:50:51.631 --> 00:50:52.966
It says...

393
00:50:54.842 --> 00:50:57.053
"Once he feasts on five souls,

394
00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:03.184
the sky will bleed again and
the abomination will rise from hell."

395
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:48.229
This is insane.

396
00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:52.775
This thing is attached to Mia's soul
like a leech.

397
00:51:52.942 --> 00:51:54.819
It's becoming her.

398
00:51:55.403 --> 00:52:00.074
If we want to stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

399
00:52:03.786 --> 00:52:05.788
Kill her.

400
00:52:06.873 --> 00:52:08.833
...I think we're gonna have to kill her.

401
00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.421
- What did you say?
- It--everything say--

402
00:52:13.588 --> 00:52:16.549
Eric! We're not gonna
fucking kill anybody!

403
00:52:16.966 --> 00:52:18.801
Are you listening to yourself?

404
00:52:20.386 --> 00:52:22.555
What about those dead cats
down in the basement?

405
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:26.851
I mean, maybe they had some disease.
I mean, some virus that it spread to Mia

406
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.104
and then she--she passed it to Olivia
when she puked all over her face.

407
00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:35.526
What kind of a virus makes a person
cut off their face with a piece of glass?

408
00:52:39.572 --> 00:52:42.659
Oh, God. Oh, God.

409
00:52:56.547 --> 00:52:59.050
I don't know what
we're dealing with here, okay?

410
00:53:00.301 --> 00:53:04.180
But it stopped raining and in a couple
hours, the river will be clear.

411
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:07.350
And we're gonna get out of this place.
All of us.

412
00:53:08.267 --> 00:53:10.520
It doesn't matter where we go.

413
00:53:10.978 --> 00:53:15.900
If we don't do something right now,
we're all gonna be dead by then!

414
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.648
Don't do it, you little bitch,
don't cut it off!

415
00:54:04.949 --> 00:54:07.618
- Don't cut it off.
- Fuck you.

416
00:54:15.626 --> 00:54:17.628
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

417
00:54:43.029 --> 00:54:45.156
I had to do it.

418
00:54:45.323 --> 00:54:46.866
And I feel much better now.

419
00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:02.465
Hold on, baby, hold on, please.

420
00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:06.511
Okay, Eric and I, we're gonna...
we're gonna put a stop to this, okay?

421
00:55:07.386 --> 00:55:11.140
I promise that everything's
going to be fine, okay? Okay.

422
00:55:12.266 --> 00:55:17.146
She just cut her fucking arm off.
Does that sound fine?

423
00:55:28.032 --> 00:55:30.243
These inscriptions are confusing,

424
00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:33.913
sometimes contradictory,
they're consistent about one thing.

425
00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:40.211
In order to stop this,
the possessed must be cleansed.

426
00:55:41.003 --> 00:55:42.296
Purified.

427
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:45.800
The book describes three specific ways.

428
00:55:48.803 --> 00:55:49.804
A live burial.

429
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:50.972
Live burial.

430
00:55:54.976 --> 00:55:56.143
Bodily dismemberment.

431
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:57.728
Bodily dismemberment.

432
00:56:02.441 --> 00:56:04.235
And purification by fire.

433
00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:10.491
You sure this'll work?

434
00:56:12.785 --> 00:56:13.953
If we...

435
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:18.624
If I kill my sister...

436
00:56:19.417 --> 00:56:20.710
she'll be at peace?

437
00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:26.716
Am I...am I sure? Of course not,
this is not a science book.

438
00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:29.385
Look, I'm sure of one thing.

439
00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:34.140
Whatever is inside Mia
is the cause of all this.

440
00:56:34.807 --> 00:56:37.768
If she dies,
then this thing is going to die with her.

441
00:56:37.935 --> 00:56:39.770
What if she just lost her mind?

442
00:56:42.523 --> 00:56:43.900
What if she just needs a doctor?

443
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.902
What? A doctor?

444
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.948
My mom died in a mental hospital.
She was crazy.

445
00:56:51.365 --> 00:56:53.618
She was deranged, she was a monster.

446
00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:58.372
I've always feared that me and
Mia would end up like her.

447
00:57:05.546 --> 00:57:09.926
So you're just a fucking coward.

448
00:57:11.177 --> 00:57:15.973
You know exactly what we have to do, but
you're too scared to go through with it.

449
00:57:17.099 --> 00:57:18.935
I'm gonna burn this fucking place down.

450
00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.812
I'm gonna end this nightmare.

451
00:57:23.689 --> 00:57:26.275
Why don't you just run away?

452
00:57:26.817 --> 00:57:29.612
Go hide beneath some rock somewhere.

453
00:57:30.279 --> 00:57:31.614
You know, you're great at that.

454
00:57:38.663 --> 00:57:39.872
Oh, shit.

455
00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:57.825
Where the fuck did she go?

456
00:59:00.995 --> 00:59:03.330
Take it before she does.

457
00:59:42.787 --> 00:59:45.831
Stop!

458
00:59:53.798 --> 00:59:55.674
No! No! No!

459
00:59:55.841 --> 00:59:59.261
No! No! No, no, no!

460
01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:27.957
David.

461
01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:37.508
Why are you hurting me?

462
01:00:45.766 --> 01:00:48.435
My face hurts.

463
01:00:49.603 --> 01:00:52.731
Why? Why?

464
01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:55.985
Why does my face hurt?

465
01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.904
Baby, baby...

466
01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:07.705
Natalie...

467
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:39.528
Come on. Come on, man, here we are.

468
01:01:44.158 --> 01:01:48.370
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
Don't die on me, please.

469
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.082
Dying wouldn't be so bad right now.

470
01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:58.088
I just don't want
to become the devil's bitch.

471
01:02:03.093 --> 01:02:04.845
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

472
01:02:06.847 --> 01:02:09.516
I'm gonna do what I gotta do, okay?

473
01:02:57.439 --> 01:02:58.607
Sorry, Mia.

474
01:03:00.317 --> 01:03:01.443
I love you.

I can't do this.

485
01:04:13.515 --> 01:04:14.683
Okay.

486
01:04:15.934 --> 01:04:19.271
This time, the only fucking way
is the hard way.

487
01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:02.773
David.

488
01:05:03.941 --> 01:05:06.110
Murderer.

489
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:09.822
Coward.

490
01:07:11.693 --> 01:07:12.694
Eric.

491
01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:36.134
Hey. Hey.

492
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.762
David.

493
01:07:40.597 --> 01:07:41.932
I missed you, man.

494
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.601
Yeah.

495
01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.647
You know that, buddy.

496
01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.896
David?

497
01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.940
David?

498
01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:16.151
I can't move.

499
01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:19.279
I can't breathe. David!

500
01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:22.199
Help me!

501
01:09:22.449 --> 01:09:25.494
Help me, David!

502
01:09:25.952 --> 01:09:27.704
- You're not her.
- David!

503
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.501
You're not her!

504
01:09:39.383 --> 01:09:40.676
Why do you hate me, David?

505
01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:45.389
I know you do.

506
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.684
You left home.

507
01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:54.231
You left me all alone
with our sick mother.

508
01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:56.441
And I was just a kid.

509
01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.653
You made me lie.

510
01:10:01.738 --> 01:10:06.326
Every time she screamed your name,
I told her you were coming to see her.

511
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.495
Like you promised.

512
01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:11.289
But you never did.

513
01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:16.128
Please stop it. I'm begging you.

514
01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.381
I know Mother hates you now.

515
01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:22.884
And she waits for you in hell.

516
01:10:32.185 --> 01:10:34.354
Shut up. Shut up.

517
01:10:51.496 --> 01:10:53.874
I'm so sorry.

518
01:10:58.044 --> 01:10:59.588
I should have been there.

519
01:11:01.673 --> 01:11:03.467
I should have been there for you.

520
01:11:59.689 --> 01:12:01.650
Come on. Please, come back.

521
01:12:06.446 --> 01:12:07.823
Come on, come on, come on.

522
01:12:08.114 --> 01:12:10.158
Come on, Mia, come back to me,
come on, please.

523
01:12:54.286 --> 01:12:55.787
Okay, you're at peace.

524
01:12:57.956 --> 01:12:59.291
You're at peace now.

525
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:27.861
David?

526
01:13:34.284 --> 01:13:35.368
Mia?

527
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.085
It was so horrible.

528
01:13:45.962 --> 01:13:47.631
It was so horrible.

529
01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.968
It's okay. It's all over now.

530
01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.933
Thanks for not leaving me, David.

531
01:14:07.233 --> 01:14:09.569
Wait here. I'm gonna get the car keys.

532
01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:11.905
- Okay?
- Yeah.

533
01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.471
- David? ?
- Go!

534
01:15:18.638 --> 01:15:20.682
- Please, no, no, no, no.
- Go. Go!

535
01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.518
I'm not gonna go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!

536
01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:30.608
Mia, take the keys. Look at me. Let's go.

537
01:15:30.775 --> 01:15:32.318
Come on, come on, let's go.

538
01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:39.784
Get outta here.

539
01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:42.328
No!

540
01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:45.874
No! David!

541
01:15:54.966 --> 01:15:57.552
David! David!

542
01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:08.396
He's coming.

543
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:01.551
Shit.

544
01:18:42.091 --> 01:18:44.010
Mia.

545
01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:44.529
Come here, bitch!

546
01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.074
Come on.

547
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.634
You're gonna die here,
you pathetic junkie.

548
01:22:14.303 --> 01:22:15.930
I've had enough of this shit.

549
01:22:53.676 --> 01:22:56.846
I will feast on your soul.

550
01:23:00.224 --> 01:23:01.851
Feast on this, motherfucker.

551
01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:17.116
Die!

552
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:38.888
Go back to hell, bitch.

553
01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:33.075
<i>I believe I have made
a significant find in the Candarian Ruins,</i>

554
01:29:33.242 --> 01:29:37.997
<i>a volume of ancient Sumerian burial
practices and funerary incantations.</i>

555
01:29:38.455 --> 01:29:44.295
<i>It is entitled</i> Naturom Demon to.
<i>Roughly translated,</i> Book of the Dead.

556
01:29:44.461 --> 01:29:48.632
<i>The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.</i>

557
01:29:48.966 --> 01:29:52.094
<i>It deals with demons,
demon resurrection,</i>

558
01:29:52.261 --> 01:29:55.848
<i>and those forces which roam the forest
and dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

559
01:29:57.182 --> 01:30:00.269
<i>The first few pages warned
that these enduring creatures</i>

560
01:30:00.436 --> 01:30:03.439
<i>may lie dormant, but are never truly dead.</i>

561
01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:05.774
<i>They may be recalled to active life</i>

562
01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:08.527
<i>through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

563
01:30:08.694 --> 01:30:11.071
<i>It is through recitation
of these passages</i>

564
01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:14.950
<i>that the demons are given license
to possess the living.</i>

565
01:30:48.901 --> 01:30:52.237
<i>I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods and I have no doubt</i>

566
01:30:52.404 --> 01:30:58.661
<i>that whatever I have resurrected through
this book is sure to come calling for me.</i>

567
01:31:09.838 --> 01:31:11.215
Groovy.
