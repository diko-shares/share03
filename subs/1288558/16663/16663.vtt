1
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:36,833
We should've taken the elevator.
It wasn't that narrow.

2
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,432
A mezuzah...

3
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,941
What's your colleague's name again?

4
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:44,669
Saint Alban.
Never have guessed.

5
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,237
Hang on... Here.

6
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,502
Thanks.

7
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,537
Good evening.

8
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:07,340
Pleased to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

9
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,741
Yes. I brought you some wine.

10
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:12,209
Thanks. Is it kosher?

11
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:16,474
No, it's an Angélus.

12
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,376
Never mind.
We'll drink it later.

13
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:20,968
Come on.

14
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:35,673
- Here we are.
- Smells good.

15
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,508
We're in for a treat.

16
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,442
Here.

17
00:01:40,498 --> 00:01:44,777
- You left your son alone?
- He's 27 years old.

18
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,747
That's no reason, it's Friday.
It's Shabbat.

19
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,507
Hon, get the challah
out of the oven.

20
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:54,104
Khadija,
the challah, please!

21
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,271
Alain, you say the prayer.

22
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,281
- No...
- Yes, you're the guest.

23
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,369
- No, really...
- Go on.

24
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:02,176
- I don't have my glasses.
- Use mine.

25
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,578
- No...
- Leave him alone.

26
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,580
- He's not Jewish.
- Mom!

27
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,711
- He's not.
- Mom, are you from the Gestapo?

28
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:13,338
What's your name?

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,939
Gaash. With 2 ''a's.

30
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,503
That's not Jewish.

31
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,912
- It is. It's Ashkenazi.
- Is it?

32
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:21,946
It's very rare.

33
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,571
You don't have to reply.

34
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:26,173
It comes from Lithuania.

35
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,909
You're not Jewish.

36
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,004
Mam!

37
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,413
I converted for our wedding.

38
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,274
I'll say the prayer.

39
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,714
You're not circumcised.

40
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,216
No.

41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,309
My parents thought
it was too barbaric.

42
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,777
You see, he's not Jewish.

43
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,413
What was all that about?

44
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,678
They restaged the Nuremberg Trials!

45
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:11,878
I'm as Jewish as he is.

46
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,818
Just 'cause I can't read Hebrew...

47
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:17,511
if there's a raid,
they'll take me, too!

48
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:18,949
And me?

49
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:22,282
Sure, you too, honey.
You're going, too.

50
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:25,548
We'll all be gassed together.

51
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,085
Don't overdo it.

52
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:31,810
He's the one
who changed his name.

53
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:33,545
He's the one hiding.

54
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:37,382
I'm not ashamed of my origins.
I was born a Gaash, I'll die a Gaash!

55
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,817
Mind you,
Saint Alban is pretty smart.

56
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:46,515
I mean, Benchemoul Clinic
doesn't sound too great.

57
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,510
Your son's at reception
to see you.

58
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:55,917
I can't. I have a delivery.

59
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,580
Dad, spare a minute?
I need a word.

60
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:00,643
- Am I disturbing you?
- Shoot.

61
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,951
You know
that Gladys and I are in love.

62
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,214
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:08,017
- You like her, don't you?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,944
We're getting married.

65
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:14,046
- Who?
- Me and Gladys.

66
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,384
Ah, Gladys? Is she well?

67
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,980
The marriage...
I wanted you to know first.

68
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,021
Why me?

69
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,879
We were going to use St. Roch...

70
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,617
- Coming!
- But it's too small.

71
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,054
The Madeleine has a great choir.

72
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:30,181
- Why do you want a choir?
- Dad!

73
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,450
I'm so happy!

74
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:45,520
Calm down.
Deep breaths.

75
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,921
My son's marrying in church.

76
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,423
I didn't see him grow up.

77
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,085
Nor did I. And yet I was there.

78
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:26,156
Jesus was an Israelite, too,
to start with...

79
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:29,023
We all come from the same branch.

80
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,253
Yes. We're all like monkeys!

81
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:36,521
An anchovy pastry, Mr. Sapin?

82
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,555
I love Woody Allen.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,857
And Einstein! Not everyone
could invent the relativity theory.

84
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,520
True, true...

85
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,086
Did you see Dad?

86
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:03,253
No idea where he is.
He must be off, getting drunk.

87
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,626
Well, that's it! We lost him.

88
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:08,660
Who?

89
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:11,991
Nicolas.

90
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,727
First Giséle,

91
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:20,389
now Gladys...

92
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,122
Couldn't she be called Rachel?

93
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,959
Giséle converted.

94
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,294
- She even chose the synagogue.
- Very nice of her, I'm sure.

95
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,991
You know what I mean,
they're not like us.

96
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:35,190
No, I don't.
Do they eat their children?

97
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,458
There's no need to be rude.

98
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:39,793
Ah, yes, I remember now.

99
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:42,923
Giséle wakes up,
hairs sprouting all over,

100
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:47,228
and rubs her bare body
against crosses, singing Wagner!

101
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:50,424
- You've drunk too much.
- No, not enough!

102
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,293
Not enough, Mom.

103
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,231
That was close.

104
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:08,062
Aren't you sick of it?

105
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,065
Only 2 games left.

106
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:13,589
I mean of your job,
your patients,

107
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,633
the apartment and everything?

108
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,964
Is it because of Nicolas?
He'll always love you...

109
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,627
We'll grow old and die.
That's all that's left.

110
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,030
C'mon, honey.

111
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,431
Let's finish the game, OK?

112
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,366
- We have it all.
- Isn't that what you wanted?

113
00:07:30,554 --> 00:07:33,228
But it can't carry on like this.

114
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,392
- Ready?
- Yes.

115
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,230
Let's just finish the game.

116
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,529
- We're going cold.
- Just a minute.

117
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:51,198
Do you want to go
on a little trip somewhere?

118
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,201
Far away.

119
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,360
Leave everything behind,
start over.

120
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:01,025
We could go to...
I don't know, Chile?

121
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,904
Visit Valparaiso. I hear
the meat's excellent over there.

122
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:10,665
Just opposite
is Robinson Crusoe's Island.

123
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:15,638
Or we could visit New Zealand,
the Marquesas Islands

124
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,134
or Bora Bora?

125
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,637
No, I want to go to Israel.

126
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:26,764
- Let's stop then.
- Israel? Coming!

127
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,329
Happy birthday!

128
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,372
It's in 2 months...

129
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:51,463
It came in early.
The dealer couldn't keep it.

130
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:53,698
Lovely, isn't she?

131
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,330
Go on, get in.

132
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,637
Smell that? It smells new.

133
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:06,539
Look at this. Leather upholstery,
bucket seats...

134
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:11,303
Automatic gearbox which slips
into manual when you want some fun.

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,271
And best of all...

136
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,533
an electric top!

137
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:19,406
Imagine, it's raining,
the wipers are going.

138
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,532
Monotony, boredom...

139
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,905
And... Oh! All of a sudden,
a ray of sunlight.

140
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,467
Hey presto, press the button,
open the top... Bliss!

141
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,031
The open air!
It takes 6 seconds to open.

142
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,074
Like her?

143
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,301
I thought all this was over.

144
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:38,999
What about Israel?

145
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,507
Israel?

146
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:42,735
Oh, yes, Israel. Sure!

147
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,206
Yeah, sure.

148
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,264
This is extra. Try her out.

149
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,365
Go on.

150
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,602
I'll watch you.

151
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,975
Giséle!

152
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,804
Are you OK, Giséle?

153
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,609
Much better!

154
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,776
A chauffeur...

155
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,141
Trying to win me over?

156
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,605
What are you doing?
It says Gash. ls your name Gash?

157
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,304
Of course it is.

158
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,777
Who do they think they are?

159
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:54,080
- Seriously? Gash?
- Yes, but with 2 ''a's.

160
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:58,441
A palm tree!

161
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,605
Lovely.

162
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,907
So, there were Gashes in Bulgaria?

163
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:05,811
- Lithuania.
- Bet they didn't eat couscous!

164
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,712
Is it your first time in Israel, too?

165
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,110
Are you nuts?

166
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,808
It's my second home.
No, it is my home.

167
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:17,338
Israel runs in my veins.
Israel is my blood.

168
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,970
Israel is my life.

169
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,638
We honeymooned here.

170
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:22,544
And now, our aliyah!

171
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:26,344
We have the apartment, passport...
We're real Israelis.

172
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:29,245
And the kids' future is here.

173
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:33,307
Why are all those girls in fatigues
thumbing a lift?

174
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:35,212
They're doing military service.

175
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,250
- I don't wanna do that.
- You'll do as you're told!

176
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:41,442
Don't worry, hon,
you'll do what you want.

177
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,982
Right.
Let me show you around.

178
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,609
I know a kebab restaurant.
Where are you staying?

179
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,310
At the David Intercontinental.

180
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,147
- Doctor or lawyer?
- Gynecologist.

181
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:57,446
I won't send you my wife!

182
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,813
The taxi fare's on me.

183
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,315
No, really...

184
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,748
- I'll pay.
- Don't be so polite.

185
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,216
All Gashes here!
Gimme your cell.

186
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,947
Your cellphone number.

187
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,117
Hurry up. C'mon!

188
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,748
Look, they gave me
a disposable kippah.

189
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,877
Put your hands on the wall.

190
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,350
Let yourself be penetrated.

191
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,952
Can you feel it?

192
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,577
It's...

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,120
It's intense.

194
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:04,752
Really? You felt it?

195
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,343
Yes, it's strong.

196
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,385
- And you?
- Yes, of course.

197
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,216
Here!

198
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,482
Write a note.

199
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,954
Make a wish, a prayer.

200
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,487
To the wall?

201
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,647
Yes, to God.

202
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,745
That's why
there are all these papers.

203
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,350
- Here.
- What did you put?

204
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,853
I can't say.

205
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,622
What shall I put?

206
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:43,748
Make sure that Paris St. Germain

207
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:46,586
beats Marseille.

208
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,412
Now that would be good!

209
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:02,847
It's magnificent.
How much is it exactly?

210
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:08,221
Look, there are even orange trees
in the garden.

211
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,522
Sorry, my wife insists
on visiting houses.

212
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,114
It's a fad.

213
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:15,352
It's the same on every trip.

214
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:16,719
It must have a price!

215
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,383
Why are we here?

216
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,651
Why aren't we at Eilat,
swimming with dolphins?

217
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:25,422
We have no reason to be here.
This is the 3rd house.

218
00:15:57,185 --> 00:15:58,754
Hello?

219
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,059
Oh, hello, honey!

220
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:04,190
It's midnight.
I was worried to death.

221
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:08,428
It's 11 in Paris? It's never too late
to phone your mom.

222
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:12,366
Oh, yes, it's a magical place.
If you could see it...

223
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,127
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

224
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,129
I'm cutting the cord!

225
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:33,090
We'll never find the car.

226
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,960
I don't believe it...

227
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:48,624
It was good last night.

228
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:51,724
Yeah...

229
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:55,361
We haven't made love
like that in weeks.

230
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:57,162
8 months.

231
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,598
What?

232
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:01,465
We haven't made love in 8 months.

233
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,432
Are you sure?

234
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:02,468
Why call a guy I don't know?

235
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,472
I met him once at some conference.

236
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:08,132
I wanted to go see
the dolphins in Eilat.

237
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,802
This hospital manager orders
4 copies of your book.

238
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,671
That's almost half your sales.
You must go say hello.

239
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,933
Just call him.

240
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,099
I don't know where he works.

241
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,763
Can't be many hospitals...

242
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:27,240
I didn't come on vacation
to call hospitals.

243
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:29,103
No, it's out of the question.

244
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,334
I came here 14 years ago
and never looked back.

245
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:35,500
Do you know
what we're short of here?

246
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,733
- Talent like you.
- Oh, please...

247
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:39,796
Should I hide what I think?

248
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,003
Rosenbaum, head of gynecology,
is moving to Philadelphia.

249
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:46,098
I'd like to make you an offer.

250
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:47,468
Are you serious?

251
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,134
As serious as a tax inspector!

252
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,175
I must replace Rosenbaum.

253
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:55,073
Call me
and your contract will be ready.

254
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,404
Providence has sent you.

255
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,965
Are you a believer?
Nor am I!

256
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:02,406
I'd give my right arm
to have you.

257
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:03,998
Giséle!

258
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,909
Professor Siletsky.
Charmed!

259
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:12,533
"Sonograms of Placenta Previa".

260
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:16,601
What a book!
That marvelous fetus on the cover!

261
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:18,108
What's in that brain?

262
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:21,144
I'd like to look
at how all those synapses work.

263
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:23,006
He's a genius, you know that?

264
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,840
- Please!
- And not bad at tennis, I hear.

265
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:29,639
I used to compete,
won a few trophies...

266
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,200
- Really?
- Sure.

267
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:35,303
- Yes, in '82, remember?
- Stop it or I won't let you leave!

268
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:36,866
I'm coming.

269
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,070
Sorry, duty calls.
Delighted to meet you.

270
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,805
- Alain, see you very soon, I hope.
- Thank you.

271
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:47,502
Why are we here?
You know I hate cemeteries.

272
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:07,578
"Jacob Gaash".

273
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,637
I phoned around. This is
the only cemetery with a Gaash.

274
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,746
Dad mentioned a Lithuanian uncle

275
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,746
who went to Israel.

276
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,112
He's calling me.

277
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,613
Go on, then.

278
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,704
Me?

279
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:43,476
Yes?

280
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,313
Pardon?

281
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,576
- Yes.
- Pray.

282
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:58,048
- Pray...
- Kaddish, for the dead.

283
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,241
Need...

284
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,078
10 men.

285
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,273
Am n

286
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:11,750
Oh, yes, very good.
I understand.

287
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,875
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

288
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,917
Thank you, sir.

289
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,280
Hi, I have family in France.

290
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,717
- Where are you from?
- Paris.

291
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:10,548
I love Paris.

292
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:13,588
Celine Dion, Adidas, paella...

293
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,452
My brother's there. Know him?
Shlomo Shapiro? Handsome.

294
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,920
Shlomo Shapiro, handsome?
No...

295
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:22,180
- Know Shlomo Shapiro?
- No.

296
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,587
All around, we'll plant 50-foot-high
palm trees we bring in from Egypt.

297
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:29,645
No expense spared.
It'll be really incredible.

298
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:34,214
On the top floor,
the apartments have a huge terrace

299
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:36,755
overlooking the gardens
and the patio.

300
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,382
It's the Tel Aviv of tomorrow...
today!

301
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,979
Know what?
I've kept one for my mom.

302
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:45,023
Gisele, what're we doing here?

303
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,078
- Take that hard hat off!
- No.

304
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:51,420
It's 4 hours from Paris.
Perfect for a second home.

305
00:22:51,475 --> 00:22:54,548
Vacations, weekends -
you'll soon recoup the cost.

306
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,181
When you sell,
I'll find you a buyer in a day.

307
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,349
- When will it be ready?
- 3 months.

308
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,516
Maybe 2, God willing.
Okay, I'll do you a favor.

309
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:08,289
My brother's number in Paris.
Call him when you get back.

310
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:12,120
Give him 25% of the sum
to block the sale,

311
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,986
5% when you get the keys,

312
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:17,184
and the rest over 5 years
interest free.

313
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,780
I need a prompt decision.

314
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:20,152
We'll think it over.

315
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:22,749
Think what over?

316
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:28,452
Don't take too long.
They're selling like fruit cakes.

317
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:02,151
Did you call Shapiro's brother?

318
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,352
Who?

319
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:05,121
The real estate agent.

320
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,422
What?

321
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,654
- What?
- Yes, what?

322
00:24:14,981 --> 00:24:16,254
What?

323
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:19,489
You said you'd call him last week.

324
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:25,263
What is this?
We have a good life here,

325
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:29,025
we want for nothing,
but we're not rolling in it.

326
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,722
Do you want to go?

327
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:36,356
Look, let's think it over... calmly.

328
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,589
Why rush into it?

329
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:48,366
I spent 20 years
raising our son, helping you...

330
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:51,489
- There's worse.
- Sure, but...

331
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,292
with Nicolas gone,
I have no reason to stay.

332
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,261
But why Israel?

333
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:58,992
Why?
We know nothing about the place.

334
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,997
I felt good there.

335
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:05,187
I wasn't a mother...

336
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,093
or a wife. I was me.

337
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,791
Just Giséle.
I was happy.

338
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,457
I can't explain it.

339
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:15,624
I want to go back to understand.

340
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,028
Understand what?

341
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,429
Who I am.

342
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:25,031
Look, we were on vacation.

343
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:26,758
It was sunny...

344
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,993
if you like, we can buy
a house down south,

345
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,157
but not too far south...

346
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:33,994
It's not so simple.

347
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:41,133
So, do we buy an aquarium,
adopt a dolphin and everyone's happy?

348
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:44,292
I may not be a good wife, but...

349
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,560
if you want a divorce, I'll go.

350
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,066
All right, Doctor?

351
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,795
Yes. See you Tuesday?

352
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:54,161
Get dressed.

353
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,760
You can't start over at 54!

354
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,529
I thought you'd lost your tongue.

355
00:26:01,587 --> 00:26:02,998
Where will you live?

356
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,295
Oh, I forgot!
We bought a place.

357
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:08,529
- He's crazy.
- What with? You couldn't ever save!

358
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,535
- You don't even speak Hebrew.
- We'll learn.

359
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,795
You just don't realize...

360
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,768
What do you expect to find?

361
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,098
The land of milk and honey!

362
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:22,729
Bullshit! The land
of exploding buses, more like!

363
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,200
What's your problem?
Is it Israel?

364
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:29,329
Forget Israel. Let's say
we bought a place in Paraguay.

365
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:32,734
I'll be the first Jew
to play panpipes in a poncho.

366
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,896
You can learn the tango...

367
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,594
That's Argentina.

368
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,398
- They have excellent meat.
- Paraguay?

369
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,129
Argentina!

370
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,034
They always win Miss Universe.

371
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,161
Wrong!

372
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,862
That's Venezuela. 5 wins!

373
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:50,462
We're not going to Paraguay!
It was an example.

374
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:53,095
It's like saying Ghana.

375
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:54,831
What'd you do in Ghana?

376
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,064
Are you doing it on purpose?
Are you?

377
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,661
I'm going to Israel, Dad!

378
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:00,998
We're going.

379
00:27:01,057 --> 00:27:04,005
- I'm against it.
- We're still going.

380
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,366
I'm against it!

381
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,598
Look, we're not joining a sect!

382
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:11,231
Don't talk to your mom like that.
You've been drinking.

383
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,432
When we talk,
we've been drinking!

384
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:16,564
The problem is,
you're ashamed of being Jewish.

385
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:19,402
And I was raised the same way.

386
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:22,736
That's why I'm leaving.
I want to know who I am.

387
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,002
Gefilte fish
and Yehudi Menuhin -

388
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:29,596
there's more to it!

389
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,266
Thank you
for spoiling your dad's birthday.

390
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,273
You say they're not like us.

391
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:39,738
I never heard you say,
"I'm Jewish."

392
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:41,170
Got a problem with that?

393
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,934
Are you ashamed?

394
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:46,806
Go on, say it: "I'm Jewish".
Don't be ashamed.

395
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,499
I want to say I'm Jewish.

396
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:50,734
I'm a Jew!
I'm a Jew!

397
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,503
I'm Jewish,
but I don't go looking for trouble.

398
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,801
Well, I am. I'll say it.

399
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:58,637
I'm Jewish,
and so are you, Mother.

400
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:01,642
Let's all say it.
Toi toi toi! I'm Jewish!

401
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:03,139
I'm a Jew!

402
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:08,841
How did thingamajig go?
Rabbi Jacob. How did he go?

403
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,136
That's it.

404
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:13,870
Sorry, that was 50 years
of repressed Judaism.

405
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,434
Giséle, did you put
this idea in his head?

406
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,443
What're you trying to prove?

407
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:25,235
Shut your face, Mom.

408
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,176
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

409
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:38,173
If it goes wrong,
you'll always have a job here.

410
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:39,676
It won't go wrong.

411
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,677
They promised him a great job.

412
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,938
Yes, I saw the fax.

413
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,808
- Are you happy?
- Oh, yes, very happy-

414
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:49,242
- And Giséle?
- She's delighted.

415
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:53,234
So, may God dilate you!

416
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,572
Right!

417
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,804
Thanks.

418
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,638
What are you doing?

419
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:24,408
Come here.

420
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:27,607
I won't kiss the carpet!
Come along. Something wrong?

421
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,907
It's nothing.

422
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:47,649
You have to go to the Jewish Agency
to put your papers in order.

423
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:50,807
It's Shabbat,
so it's shut until 8.

424
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:55,283
Why? I didn't think
the Jewish Agency observed Shabbat.

425
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,315
They're resting, sir.

426
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,177
It's their day off.

427
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:04,343
You're in Israel.

428
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:13,975
Over 3 hours to wait... Great!

429
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,014
Why did you ask for accommodation
at the hostel?

430
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,209
My wife's idea.

431
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,650
All the emigrants start off
in the hostel.

432
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,550
I'm not allowed to refuse.

433
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:47,710
Why do you all come here?

434
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:52,346
What attracts you?
The bombings, unemployment, the war?

435
00:30:52,406 --> 00:30:54,215
We're Jewish.

436
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,082
There are no Jews here -
just Israelis.

437
00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:01,611
So, what do you do for a living?
Lawyer, doctor?

438
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,652
- Don't tell me.
- Gynecologist.

439
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:05,982
- And I raised my son.
- Right.

440
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:09,180
Know how many
gynecologists there are?

441
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,242
- No.
- A lot.

442
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:26,619
It's a robot.

443
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,281
Are you sure it's here?

444
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,417
Looks bizarre to me.

445
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,653
Right...

446
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:44,157
okay...

447
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:54,983
You won't go to a hotel?

448
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:58,220
It's symbolic. I'd feel like
I'm on vacation in a hotel.

449
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,385
Right.

450
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,421
We won't last long here.

451
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,121
Well, Shapiro said the apartment
would be ready in 3 weeks.

452
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,821
Sure you want to stay here?

453
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,522
You think we can stay here?
Yeah, why not...

454
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,685
- Sure you want to stay?
- Yes.

455
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:25,795
It reminds me of your student room
back in the day.

456
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,086
Your passports.

457
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:41,858
The restroom's there.
The shower's in the hall.

458
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,987
Can we have a spare key?

459
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,960
This isn't a hotel!

460
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:49,724
Give me everything back
when you go. Clean!

461
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:52,558
1 saucepan.

462
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,892
2 forks.

463
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,487
2 plates.
1 electric kettle.

464
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,552
1 toilet brush.

465
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:02,152
1 roll of toilet paper.

466
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,456
Clean, too?

467
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:11,656
Your administrative forms
to be filled out and given in.

468
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,628
You have time.
Tomorrow, please.

469
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,220
Is there any hurry?

470
00:34:15,284 --> 00:34:18,527
You want to become Israeli or not?

471
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:23,291
Well, we really did it.

472
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:25,991
We did.

473
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,597
You haven't called Nicolas?

474
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,189
- No.
- Well, now...

475
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:40,065
Really? That's better.

476
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:43,288
You're doing well.

477
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,591
Did you flush?

478
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,997
A thousand times.

479
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,795
Think it'll stop?

480
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,128
No!

481
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:17,564
Bravo. Thank you very much.

482
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,659
Good bye.

483
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:44,396
You were told we're full.

484
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:45,799
Don't stay here.

485
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,804
Yours is the only class in French.

486
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:52,669
You can't miss the start of a course.

487
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:55,033
I'll work hard, I'll catch up.

488
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,766
Talmud classes, Jewish thinking,
modern Hebrew...

489
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,498
You don't even know what you want!

490
00:36:02,557 --> 00:36:05,561
I chose it all.
Unless you have other options...

491
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,831
Such as?

492
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:10,998
Dog training, knife throwing...

493
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,039
Go home. I can't help you, lady.

494
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,332
Good day!

495
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,701
- Good day!
- I'm not leaving.

496
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:22,263
What do you mean
you're not leaving?

497
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:25,773
- I left everything to come here.
- That's your problem.

498
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:29,467
I could do voluntary work.
I have lots of free time.

499
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:32,132
Will you ever leave me alone?

500
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:33,171
No.

501
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:39,706
I've been waiting 3 hours.
Is it always like this?

502
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:50,333
But I am French. I'm French.

503
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:08,467
I'd like you
to welcome a new student.

504
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:10,371
Hello.

505
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:23,539
I'm Rabbi Yossi Raphaelson.
Welcome to our group.

506
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:27,573
You missed the start of the year.

507
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:30,543
Are you familiar
with the concept of Tsimtzum?

508
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,237
Not really.

509
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:37,403
The Tsimtzum,
by the void it introduces,

510
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,568
represents the paradigm

511
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,440
of "indifference
in the undifferentiated".

512
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:45,306
The otherness in the separation,

513
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,937
the distancing, the differentiation

514
00:37:48,997 --> 00:37:53,104
from which no fusion
will be possible any longer.

515
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,876
What are they doing?
strangling ducks?

516
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,969
Don't be mean. It's nice to have
a musical accompaniment.

517
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:10,903
Oh, what lovely eggs.

518
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:12,603
Very pretty...

519
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,745
Good morning.

520
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,176
Good morning, hon.

521
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:26,509
- Good morning.
- Yes, good morning.

522
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:28,171
Good morning!

523
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:29,234
Oh, I see!

524
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,274
Thank you very much.

525
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,335
Good.

526
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,142
- My name is Alain Gaash.
- That's easy.

527
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:46,678
No, "ima" means "mom".

528
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,572
Oh, yes, mom, right...

529
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,605
What language will you work in?

530
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,411
Except you!

531
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:06,209
Oh, come on!

532
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:12,047
Promise me
you won't work nights.

533
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,480
But of course!

534
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:17,483
You know...
I'm not as young as I was.

535
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:24,307
Thank you.

536
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,781
Thanks a lot.

537
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,472
Gaash! My friend!

538
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:36,108
What a nice surprise!
Pleased to see you.

539
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,082
So pleased!

540
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,644
Admiring Oswaldo, my hamster?

541
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:44,911
It's incredibly well-made.

542
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,747
The eyes... See that?

543
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:50,216
Looks like he's looking at you.

544
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:53,514
- You think so, too?
- Yes.

545
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:56,506
Very original.

546
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:59,678
Tell me... When did you arrive?

547
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,183
2 days ago.

548
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:04,277
I am pleased to see you!
Staying long?

549
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,182
I've moved here.

550
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,011
About that job you promised me...

551
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:14,178
- Sorry?
- You know, the job.

552
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:17,848
You did promise me a job.

553
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:20,318
And I was right to.
We need people like you.

554
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:22,410
SQ?

555
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:24,282
So... what?

556
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,344
Is Dr. Rosenbaum
still moving to Philadelphia?

557
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:29,546
- He still is.
- Ah, that's good.

558
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:33,110
But he's a bit behind schedule.
Family trouble.

559
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:37,213
He should be leaving
in 2 or 3 months, maybe 4.

560
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:38,844
- 4 months?
- Or 2.

561
00:40:38,907 --> 00:40:42,218
But we don't earn much in Israel.

562
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,550
We envy you in France.
Look.

563
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,554
Recognize him?

564
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:51,420
He's a pal. We always have a game
when he comes to Israel.

565
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,216
He's a nice guy.

566
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:56,618
So, 2 or 3 months? Sure?

567
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:59,212
Certain. God willing.

568
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:02,951
In the meantime,
see something of the country.

569
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,818
- Do you know Galilee?
- No.

570
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,652
The north? It's magnificent.
Got a car?

571
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,711
- No.
- How do you get around?

572
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:11,380
By bus.

573
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:13,081
In Israel you need a car.

574
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:16,352
A fast, stylish car
that reflects who you are.

575
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:19,413
I think it's your lucky day.

576
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,988
Look at this beauty.

577
00:41:30,477 --> 00:41:33,048
Weren't we being careful with money?

578
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,523
In Israel you need a car!

579
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,649
Don't worry about the money.

580
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,191
The job will be vacant
in 4 weeks, maybe 3.

581
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:47,054
They're keen to have me.

582
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,587
Quiet, isn't it?

583
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:54,386
Sure, there's nobody.

584
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,917
Maybe it's their day off.

585
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:04,984
They must've downed tools
the second we turned our backs.

586
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:07,492
There must be a simple explanation.

587
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:12,257
Yeah, we got screwed!
I never should have listened to you.

588
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:14,657
Shapiro's gonna hear from me!

589
00:42:17,313 --> 00:42:21,694
There's a message in Hebrew!
How perverted is that?

590
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,550
Mr. and Mrs. Gaash, hi there!

591
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,491
Where's our apartment?

592
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,221
They said you were abroad.
Nice there?

593
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:34,318
Did they?
They should be ashamed!

594
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:36,588
Still, you've found me now.

595
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:38,355
You're a crook!

596
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:44,331
I'm glad my friends can't understand,
'cause that really hurts.

597
00:42:44,382 --> 00:42:46,157
Would a crook live here?

598
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,661
The apartment
hasn't progressed at all.

599
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:51,491
I won't lie to you,
it's at a standstill.

600
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:56,089
A tiny problem
with planning permission.

601
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:58,026
It could take 3 months,
3 years, never.

602
00:42:58,082 --> 00:42:59,585
Give us our money, Shapiro!

603
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,631
I'd love to, but I can't.
They froze the accounts.

604
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:04,754
Do you know where we're living?

605
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,761
Look, take a plate, eat something...

606
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:11,092
You can't buy us
with a couple of cutlets!

607
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:13,687
- I'll sort it out.
- Why trust you?

608
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:15,822
You have no choice.

609
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:19,661
I'll find something for you,
something nice.

610
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:22,823
- Soon?
- Soon. God willing...

611
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:25,387
What do you put in this sauce?

612
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:38,500
I had an urgent call.
ls the container here?

613
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:43,365
Mrs. Gaash, there's a little problem
with your container.

614
00:43:43,418 --> 00:43:44,727
A problem?

615
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:47,733
Yes, just a small problem,
don't worry.

616
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:50,392
The ship did leave, it did arrive...

617
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:52,763
There was a problem on the way.

618
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:54,730
Damage in transit.

619
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,732
- Serious?
- No, not serious.

620
00:43:56,787 --> 00:44:01,532
A tiny little storm.
They threw your container overboard.

621
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:03,031
- That's all.
- Pardon?

622
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:07,000
They threw it... overboard.

623
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:08,726
Our container?

624
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,563
They can do that.
It says so in the contract.

625
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,896
That's international maritime law.

626
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,900
What can I say? That's how it is.

627
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,195
Fortunately, you're insured.

628
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:20,028
Ah, here it is.

629
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:25,362
1,821 shekels?

630
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:30,598
I worked it out for you.
That makes 332.12 euros.

631
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:33,033
Sign here and I'll let you go.

632
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,665
332 euros?

633
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:40,732
All our belongings were in there.

634
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,102
Is that Tel Aviv?

635
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:32,832
What's going on?

636
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:37,000
You're an hour late.

637
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:39,938
We said 2:00 o'clock, it's 2:02.

638
00:45:39,992 --> 00:45:41,495
No, we said 1:00.

639
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,470
No, 2:00.

640
00:45:43,526 --> 00:45:45,563
- 1:00.
- No, 2. Well, never mind.

641
00:45:45,626 --> 00:45:47,196
Your phone was off.

642
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,897
The battery's dead.

643
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:52,337
Where were you?

644
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,169
Doing things.

645
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:56,261
What things?

646
00:45:56,326 --> 00:45:59,967
It's the first time in 25 years
you ask me that.

647
00:46:00,026 --> 00:46:01,061
That's not true.

648
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,868
It's not. What were you doing?
We said 1:00.

649
00:46:05,694 --> 00:46:08,004
- You already ate?
- I was waiting.

650
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:10,668
I was stressed out.
I only ate half.

651
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,229
But we said 1:00.

652
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:15,002
Well, enjoy your meal!

653
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:36,364
You avoiding me or what?

654
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,431
From the airport.

655
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,635
Gash, like you!

656
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,767
Simon!

657
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:46,174
Oh, I shaved off my moustache.
Don't I look younger?

658
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:50,109
So, you've moved here?
Mazal Tov! Lunch is on me.

659
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:51,938
Got an appointment?

660
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:54,738
They make me come everyday,
so who cares? C'mon.

661
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:56,276
I already ate.

662
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,140
I kept calling you.
Playing hard to get!

663
00:46:59,197 --> 00:47:01,644
- I didn't want to impose...
- Let's eat.

664
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,575
My number's nearly up.

665
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:07,204
Don't you feel at home here?
Breathe in.

666
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:08,403
I breathe better.

667
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:11,537
Why did I wait 40 years?
Unbelievable!

668
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:19,536
Where's the certificate?

669
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,771
Pardon?

670
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,009
- What's wrong?
- It's not kosher.

671
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:27,738
- What?
- Problem?

672
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:31,575
You speak French?

673
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:33,908
Where's the kosher certificate?

674
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:35,877
You wanna eat kosher?
Eat at home!

675
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:40,541
You wanna tell me what to do here?
I'm Israeli born and bred,

676
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,206
I did military service.
Don't lecture me.

677
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:45,611
Now get out.

678
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:58,239
See this little logo?

679
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:00,303
That's kosher.

680
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:08,411
In three days, I open
my own restaurant.

681
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,841
I'll beat 'em all!

682
00:48:15,902 --> 00:48:17,608
Are you asleep?

683
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,376
Soundly.

684
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:39,143
Maybe we did say 2:00 o'clock...

685
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:41,649
Good night.

686
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,178
I'm pleased to see you, my friend!

687
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:49,910
You called me. Any news?

688
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:53,509
I have some great news.
I booked a court for 5 PM.

689
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,072
I hope you're not busy.

690
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:57,845
I'm not busy, I don't have a job.

691
00:48:57,904 --> 00:49:00,145
Well, a game of tennis
will cheer you up.

692
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,649
Can I start my job any sooner?

693
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:05,615
What did I say? Six months?

694
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:07,242
- No, three.
- Ah, yes...

695
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:09,251
Three months.

696
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:12,843
Remember Dr. Rosenbaum?

697
00:49:12,905 --> 00:49:14,851
- Yes.
- Going to Philadelphia.

698
00:49:14,905 --> 00:49:17,943
- Yes.
- His wife's pregnant.

699
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:20,179
- So?
- Well, that's it.

700
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:21,740
What's it?

701
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:26,221
He's staying. His wife wants
to give birth in Israel.

702
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:28,184
They'll leave in one or two years.

703
00:49:29,773 --> 00:49:31,081
So, I have no job?

704
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,111
Exactly. You took the words
right out of my mouth.

705
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:39,020
Don't you have
any other special skills?

706
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:40,678
Such as?

707
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,220
Do you play an instrument?

708
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:47,176
Is this a joke?

709
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,121
Okay, I may have something for you.

710
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:53,848
Call my cousin, Ronny.

711
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,685
He may be able to help you.
He sometimes has vacancies.

712
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:04,643
Mr. Gaash!

713
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:07,451
Ronny Zimmermann.
I've heard a lot about you.

714
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,921
- When can you start?
- Right away.

715
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:14,253
What does the job involve?

716
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:17,722
Two sprays with the blue aerosol
on the plastic.

717
00:50:17,776 --> 00:50:20,120
Use the yellow spray on the leather.

718
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:22,587
Then, take out the floor mats

719
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:24,588
and vacuum them.

720
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,520
You'll soon get the hang of it.

721
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:34,786
Siletsky?
There must be a misunderstanding.

722
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:36,481
I'm a gynecologist.

723
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:39,423
I need to practice
as soon as possible.

724
00:50:39,477 --> 00:50:41,048
Thank you.

725
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:12,051
Don't help me, will you?

726
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:20,327
Maybe I should have told you, but...

727
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,087
I've met somebody.

728
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,922
You've met somebody?

729
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,687
An extraordinary person.

730
00:51:26,746 --> 00:51:30,285
A brilliant mind.
He gives lessons on Jewish thinking.

731
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:32,190
It's fantastic.

732
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,650
You've nothing to say?

733
00:51:36,714 --> 00:51:38,990
There's nothing to say.

734
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,722
He's picking me up.
I want you to meet him.

735
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:45,058
- He'll be here in 5 minutes.
- Here?

736
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:46,718
- Yes.
- Where'll we put him?

737
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:52,220
Hello!

738
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,383
My husband, Alain Gaash.

739
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,554
Rabbi Raphaelson.

740
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:01,688
Pleased to meet you.

741
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:03,386
Rabbi Raphaelson...

742
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:06,123
You're very young...

743
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:10,187
Funny...
I thought rabbis were all old,

744
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:13,526
with long, white beards
and dandruff...

745
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,891
Pleased to meet you.

746
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:16,986
This is for you. Some cakes.

747
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:21,520
There's some Hamentaschen,
Lokshen Kugel...

748
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,587
- and Apfelschnecken.
- Thank you. How kind.

749
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,859
Are you really a rabbi?
I mean, a real, real rabbi.

750
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:31,763
A rabbi with diplomas.

751
00:52:31,817 --> 00:52:33,854
I've been a rabbi for four years.

752
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,920
I used to play sport.

753
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:38,329
He was in the national
beach volley team.

754
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:44,128
You've made it nice, Giséle.
I recognize your touch.

755
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:50,093
- What...
- I don't know what's wrong.

756
00:52:50,152 --> 00:52:53,998
- Must be the heat.
- Go get a glass of water!

757
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:57,459
Here, sit down.

758
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:01,324
- Thanks.
- The water!

759
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:05,334
What you had planned
seems doubtful now.

760
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:07,025
This'll do you good.

761
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,056
We're going to study.

762
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,066
Isn't it forbidden on Shabbat?

763
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,861
- No!
- Can I come?

764
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,594
Sure. You're most welcome.

765
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,532
No, I'll stay here.
I have work to do.

766
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:23,760
I feel a bit better.

767
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:28,770
Alain, you're very lucky
to have a wife like Giséle.

768
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:33,668
Well, I'll see to the cakes...

769
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:11,594
Where were you?

770
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:13,898
I was worried to death!

771
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:16,028
You thought about me?

772
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:19,128
You left your cell.
I nearly called the police.

773
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:23,263
- You thought about me?
- Of course. Come to bed.

774
00:54:23,324 --> 00:54:25,167
Can I lie down next to you?

775
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:30,834
You really thought about me?

776
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,632
Can I snuggle up to you?

777
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,629
My darling...

778
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,107
I have to tell you
something important

779
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:46,106
for you, for me, for our future.

780
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:49,968
We need to change.

781
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:53,801
I've thought it over, Alain.

782
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,039
You have to get circumcised.

783
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:04,666
Did you hear what I said?

784
00:55:04,726 --> 00:55:07,366
I think I'm going to be sick.

785
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,100
Shit!

786
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,307
Scams, murders, burglaries...

787
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,738
All between Jews... It kills me.

788
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,273
I put my boy
in a religious school.

789
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:26,672
They insulted him.

790
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:29,572
He didn't understand.
He can't speak Hebrew.

791
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:33,972
Cheer up,
I got you the sports paper.

792
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:35,701
- today's?
'Yep, a present!

793
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:38,401
You're the best!
Coffee's on me.

794
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:41,568
No, you're working.
I don't want to disturb you.

795
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,640
Well, it's not exactly busy.

796
00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:48,767
- They'll come for lunch.
- It's 3 o'clock.

797
00:55:50,796 --> 00:55:53,937
It'll be full in the summer,
what with all the tourists.

798
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,232
You pick up French radio?

799
00:56:04,296 --> 00:56:05,798
Sure, I've got the right gear.

800
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,768
Cherbourg and Brest,
41 degrees.

801
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:11,072
Paris and Nantes, 48 degrees.

802
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,302
Rain in Lyon...

803
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:13,741
Rain!

804
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:19,435
Great song.

805
00:56:21,164 --> 00:56:25,011
I'm the heir of Place Dauphine
Place Blanche looks pale

806
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:32,142
The milk trucks are full of milk
The street sweepers full of brushes

807
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,109
It's 5:00 o'clock

808
00:56:34,164 --> 00:56:35,473
Paris

809
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:39,479
awakens

810
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,675
Paris

811
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:46,305
awakens

812
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,277
The transvestites go shave,
The strippers get dressed...

813
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,435
Enough!

814
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:02,548
How are things with you?
Find a job yet?

815
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,941
Giséle wants me circumcised.

816
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,981
- You're not?
- Why does everyone ask that?

817
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:12,708
Is that all you're interested in?

818
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,610
You brought it up.

819
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,740
Yes, 'cause
she no longer wants us to make love.

820
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:23,272
- I'll show you.
- No need.

821
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:26,248
You'll want to have it done, too.

822
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,781
Here I come.

823
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:30,405
No!

824
00:57:35,102 --> 00:57:38,242
Be reasonable.
What if someone comes in?

825
00:57:38,302 --> 00:57:40,943
- Look.
- What?

826
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,210
Isn't that something?

827
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:45,271
Yes, but...

828
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,373
What's wrong?

829
00:57:47,436 --> 00:57:49,849
Has an elephant escaped
from the circus?

830
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:53,781
Shit!

831
00:58:02,703 --> 00:58:04,580
Mr. Gaash...

832
00:58:04,637 --> 00:58:09,917
You know, you don't speak Hebrew,
you're not young...

833
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:13,007
All I can offer you right now

834
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,814
- is free vocational training.
- What kind?

835
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,408
Whatever you want. You choose.
Here are the brochures.

836
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:28,248
Computer skills, word processing...

837
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:38,652
I'm a gynecologist.
I don't want training.

838
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:46,080
Mr. Gaash, do you know how many
gynecologists there are in Israel?

839
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,285
A lot.

840
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,243
Get that.

841
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,548
Who was it?

842
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:15,985
Fabrice.

843
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,885
From that game show!

844
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:19,216
Who?

845
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:22,256
Go back to sleep.

846
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,050
Is it early?

847
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:32,156
I'm meeting a big professor...
a leading light...

848
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:40,283
Feibelman... I told you about him.

849
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,548
Must be a good sign.

850
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:48,454
I'll see what he offers.

851
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:52,353
I won't sell myself short, you know.

852
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,158
How are you?

853
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,284
Voluntary work isn't too hard?

854
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:40,886
Washing laundry and hanging it up...

855
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,582
never did anyone any harm.

856
01:00:46,214 --> 01:00:49,127
Thank you, Giséle.
You're a big help.

857
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:02,053
Do you like music?

858
01:01:02,114 --> 01:01:03,388
Oh, yes, with a passion!

859
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:06,786
What kind?

860
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:08,156
The classics.

861
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:11,059
Handel, Bartok?

862
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:13,460
<i>Van Hahn, Aerosmith.</i>

863
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:16,793
Yes, that's good, too.

864
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:25,627
Listen to this.

865
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,926
Oh, yes, it's...

866
01:01:36,217 --> 01:01:38,060
It's dynamic!

867
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:46,655
I'm not in the mood.

868
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:54,798
You won't make love anymore?

869
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:57,058
What?

870
01:01:57,118 --> 01:01:59,189
Just say so.

871
01:01:59,251 --> 01:02:01,459
Just come out and say so.

872
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,658
I thought
Israel would bring us closer.

873
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:06,461
I'm trying so hard,
you turn your back on me.

874
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,464
I'll never get circumcised,
do you hear, Gisele?

875
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,658
Never!

876
01:02:25,721 --> 01:02:28,166
This is you.

877
01:02:29,886 --> 01:02:31,525
We operate...

878
01:02:39,187 --> 01:02:42,134
And this is what's left.

879
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:44,600
There's plenty left!

880
01:02:44,655 --> 01:02:47,760
You bleed a lot.

881
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:50,359
- Is it painful?
- No!

882
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:53,494
Five seconds, that's all. It's nothing.

883
01:02:53,555 --> 01:02:55,091
NOW,

884
01:02:55,155 --> 01:02:59,467
look at this short film.

885
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:02,831
It's not Bergman,

886
01:03:02,888 --> 01:03:05,994
but it's instructive,
very instructive.

887
01:03:21,524 --> 01:03:26,303
Circumcision in Hebrew is milah.

888
01:03:26,357 --> 01:03:28,530
It means "cut",

889
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,697
although the complete expression
is Brit Milah.

890
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:35,294
Brit means "alliance",

891
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:40,807
the promise God made to Abraham,
then, to all the people of Israel.

892
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:46,398
- Are you getting all this?
- Sure. Brit Milah...

893
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,995
The cut... the Alliance...

894
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,868
The psychological impact
of circumcision

895
01:03:51,924 --> 01:03:55,098
has been studied many times.

896
01:03:55,158 --> 01:03:57,537
Sigmund Freud,
for example, asserted

897
01:03:57,592 --> 01:04:00,869
that it could have
serious consequences

898
01:04:00,926 --> 01:04:04,499
on the individual's
psychological state.

899
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,201
It increases homosexual tendencies.

900
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:12,706
An increase in aggressive emotions.

901
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:15,001
A loss of self-esteem...

902
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,062
Regressive tendencies.

903
01:04:17,127 --> 01:04:19,903
Problems of...

904
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,602
of sexual identification.

905
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,936
But if you want my opinion,

906
01:04:25,993 --> 01:04:28,600
that's all a pile of crap.

907
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:35,306
It's nice of you
to invite us to party with you.

908
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:38,240
It's only natural.
I'll help you fit in,

909
01:04:38,294 --> 01:04:39,967
show you the real Israel.

910
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:41,474
We fit in very well.

911
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:44,068
Your friend's pretty.

912
01:04:44,128 --> 01:04:45,698
Yona?

913
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:48,902
Yeah, not bad.
Her father wants us to marry.

914
01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:51,875
I think he's right.

915
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,102
You'd make a fine couple,
right, Giséle?

916
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:57,075
Except she is
a world-champion lesbian!

917
01:04:58,296 --> 01:04:59,933
What was that?

918
01:04:59,995 --> 01:05:01,304
I said you're a lesbian.

919
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,908
She's like all girls her age.

920
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:08,943
She's brain-dead.

921
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:13,466
No...

922
01:05:16,464 --> 01:05:19,706
Do rabbis normally smoke marijuana?

923
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:23,575
Alain, there are 613 commandments
in the Torah.

924
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,305
Not one says
not to smoke cannabis.

925
01:05:28,731 --> 01:05:31,109
Nothing on humus, either!

926
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,000
Me?

927
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:46,002
You smoke now?

928
01:06:51,702 --> 01:06:52,976
Hello.

929
01:06:53,036 --> 01:06:55,607
- How are you today?
- Why do you ask?

930
01:06:55,669 --> 01:06:57,081
Lie down.

931
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:59,378
I said, lie down.

932
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:07,049
Show me the little Gaash.

933
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,609
What?

934
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,845
You didn't shave, old man.

935
01:07:16,904 --> 01:07:18,975
No-one told me to.

936
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:22,576
I give it a regular trim.

937
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,313
It goes down well!

938
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:26,816
OK, let's go.

939
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:28,283
C'mon!

940
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:30,114
Rivka!

941
01:07:31,738 --> 01:07:34,982
- How about an anesthetic?
- No.

942
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,849
It'd be a pity
not to feel anything.

943
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:46,280
Just a little jab?

944
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,287
In 35 years,

945
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,186
you're my first adult!

946
01:07:58,906 --> 01:08:01,716
They've all come.
Aren't you pleased?

947
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:03,616
I'm delighted, but you hurt me!

948
01:08:03,673 --> 01:08:05,119
Can I see?

949
01:08:05,174 --> 01:08:06,847
No!

950
01:08:06,907 --> 01:08:08,614
C'mon, let's go!

951
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:27,186
They'll be gone in a week.

952
01:08:27,242 --> 01:08:31,019
You have to imagine it
tastefully redecorated.

953
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:32,577
It's the Israeli style.

954
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:35,521
You're more France, Versailles...

955
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:37,021
Châteauroux!

956
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,646
We'll repaint all this.

957
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:41,279
There's a window here.

958
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,687
Another one there.

959
01:08:43,743 --> 01:08:44,949
Two windows!

960
01:08:45,976 --> 01:08:48,422
You'll love it.

961
01:08:48,476 --> 01:08:49,978
I envy you.

962
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,183
But it's only temporary?

963
01:08:52,244 --> 01:08:53,917
Yes, but nice temporary!

964
01:08:54,977 --> 01:08:57,355
Excuse me!

965
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:20,158
Sorry about that.

966
01:09:21,945 --> 01:09:25,120
- Who was it?
- Nothing important.

967
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:29,388
Who was it? I'm interested.
Your rabbi, wasn't it?

968
01:09:29,444 --> 01:09:32,949
- Yes, it was Yossi.
- Handsome Yossi...

969
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,287
You go in the kitchen to talk?

970
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:40,293
- That's nonsense.
- Yeah?

971
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:43,486
You're always with him.
Yossi this, Yossi that...

972
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,356
I do all I can.
I even had my dick cut off.

973
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:47,915
And believe me, it hurts.

974
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,927
It feels like I'm peeing razor blades.

975
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,721
How could I have thought
that a woman

976
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:56,387
who wanted my foreskin off
could love me?

977
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:57,755
What next?

978
01:09:57,813 --> 01:10:00,521
I play beach volley,
buy a G-string?

979
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:03,390
Rollerblade with a thong up the ass,

980
01:10:03,447 --> 01:10:04,984
looking at the stars?
No way!

981
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:08,461
I'm not Yossi
and I never will be!

982
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:11,755
Is he a good lay?

983
01:10:11,814 --> 01:10:13,920
There's nothing between us.

984
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:16,929
There is. Me. I'm leaving.

985
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:31,922
Couples ain't natural. It's like
piloting a submarine: gotta learn.

986
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,793
I better go. Giséle will worry.

987
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,797
One for the road.

988
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:44,493
She'll worry if I don't go home.
I don't want her to worry.

989
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:48,661
Well, I'll be going...

990
01:10:51,517 --> 01:10:53,862
The heaviest case to carry
is empty.

991
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,454
You driving?
Drop me off in Paris!

992
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,361
Would you like a drink? Tea?

993
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:13,220
Alain's gone.

994
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:18,898
We had a fight. He yelled at me.

995
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:24,428
He's jealous.
He thinks I'm cheating on him.

996
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:29,460
And are you?

997
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,394
He thinks there's something
going on between us.

998
01:11:36,553 --> 01:11:38,932
Interesting...

999
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,624
- Between you and me?
- Yes.

1000
01:11:55,821 --> 01:11:57,596
Did you say he was wrong?

1001
01:11:58,988 --> 01:12:02,026
Why? ls there really
nothing between us?

1002
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,500
I think I'll make us some tea.

1003
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:17,631
Can I sleep on your sofa tonight?

1004
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:07,638
What is it, Giséle?

1005
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:12,463
I couldn't sleep.

1006
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,298
I made some French toast.

1007
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,764
Do you like that?

1008
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,466
And I finished the milk.

1009
01:13:38,093 --> 01:13:40,335
Kiss me.

1010
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,335
SQ?

1011
01:13:50,394 --> 01:13:52,807
I can't.

1012
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:55,001
Isn't that why you're here?

1013
01:13:55,061 --> 01:13:56,973
I'm sorry, I...

1014
01:13:57,028 --> 01:13:59,770
I didn't imagine it to be like that.

1015
01:14:00,963 --> 01:14:02,839
What did you imagine, Giséle?

1016
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,169
I don't know.

1017
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:07,471
That you were in love with me?

1018
01:14:08,496 --> 01:14:11,169
I don't know what came over me.

1019
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:16,235
The picture
you must have of me now...

1020
01:14:16,296 --> 01:14:19,675
What picture?

1021
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,644
Distorted, dirty, impure...

1022
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,768
Appalling, right?

1023
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,468
Is that all?

1024
01:14:30,897 --> 01:14:34,606
Alain's the man for you,
not your rabbi.

1025
01:14:34,664 --> 01:14:37,543
It's him, not me.

1026
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:34,611
Check the register.

1027
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:38,445
I know he stayed here.
Gaash.

1028
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,674
Alain Gaash.
I have proof.

1029
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:43,340
I found a parking lot ticket
in his pocket.

1030
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:46,679
Just a minute.
You must have seen him.

1031
01:15:47,702 --> 01:15:49,340
Look closely!

1032
01:15:49,402 --> 01:15:52,781
He's my husband.
I know he stayed here.

1033
01:15:52,835 --> 01:15:56,078
Oh, sure, I recognize him.
He comes every day.

1034
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,046
I think I saw him today.

1035
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:01,814
Who was he with?

1036
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,282
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1037
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:39,819
Well, it needs furnishing now.

1038
01:16:39,872 --> 01:16:43,217
- It's just temporary, right?
- Sure it is.

1039
01:16:43,272 --> 01:16:46,811
My cousin's good value.
He recovered my suite in suede.

1040
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:50,410
There's no need. Our furniture
is arriving soon by ship.

1041
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:54,045
We must sort that out.
It should've arrived weeks ago.

1042
01:16:54,105 --> 01:16:56,484
No need, the container's gone.

1043
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:03,113
What's that you say?
The container's gone?

1044
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:08,980
That's right. I went there.
It got damaged in transit

1045
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:12,419
and they threw
the container overboard.

1046
01:17:12,474 --> 01:17:15,751
Well, I'll call you
as soon as I have any news.

1047
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:17,150
Don't worry, we'll get 'em!

1048
01:17:18,907 --> 01:17:22,583
You didn't tell me.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1049
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:36,387
Welcome!
I am neighbor corridor.

1050
01:17:36,442 --> 01:17:37,717
Nothing to break!

1051
01:17:37,776 --> 01:17:40,449
I want to break something!

1052
01:17:40,509 --> 01:17:44,081
What'll we do?
25 years of our life washed away!

1053
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:47,317
Sure it's gone?
Who told you that?

1054
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:51,449
The man told me
it happens a lot.

1055
01:17:51,509 --> 01:17:54,217
I don't give a damn!
I want my stuff!

1056
01:17:54,276 --> 01:17:57,416
It's okay. No one's dead.

1057
01:17:57,477 --> 01:17:59,479
We'll sleep on the floor,
then improvise.

1058
01:17:59,543 --> 01:18:02,649
I don't want to!
I'm sick of improvising!

1059
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:05,486
I'm a gynecologist.
I refuse to improvise.

1060
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:07,545
I want something concrete!

1061
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,886
I'm concrete.

1062
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:14,214
I don't believe it. Gisele, honey...

1063
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:18,051
Come on, Giséle...

1064
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,217
You're crazy.
Why didn't you tell me before?

1065
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:25,655
25 years of our life washed away...

1066
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:48,420
Now what?

1067
01:19:10,314 --> 01:19:13,261
Krapschnick, aged 67.

1068
01:19:13,314 --> 01:19:16,989
Former locksmith. I couldn't
leave you without a mezuzah.

1069
01:19:17,047 --> 01:19:21,018
I was the first
to move into the building in 1976.

1070
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:22,924
Welcome!

1071
01:19:22,981 --> 01:19:24,325
Welcome.

1072
01:19:24,382 --> 01:19:27,659
The neighbor
put up a mezuzah for us.

1073
01:19:29,748 --> 01:19:32,229
Won't they ever stop bugging us?

1074
01:19:32,282 --> 01:19:39,131
Rosa heard that there was a problem
with your furniture.

1075
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:14,919
Oh, shit!

1076
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:19,957
Hello?

1077
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:23,989
So, Mr Expat...
What am I? Chopped liver?

1078
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:25,360
Michel?

1079
01:20:25,419 --> 01:20:29,265
Out of sight, out of mind!
You don't even call your old pal.

1080
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:31,094
Oh, I'm swamped!

1081
01:20:31,153 --> 01:20:32,131
Got a job?

1082
01:20:32,186 --> 01:20:35,099
What do you think?
At the hospital.

1083
01:20:35,152 --> 01:20:37,189
That's great.
When do you get off?

1084
01:20:37,252 --> 01:20:39,061
Around 6:00 pm, as usual.

1085
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:41,759
OK, I'll pick you up from work.

1086
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:44,562
- What?
- I'm here for a conference.

1087
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,224
You're in Tel Aviv?

1088
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:48,597
- Proctology and Judaism.
- Great.

1089
01:20:48,653 --> 01:20:52,124
- I'll pick you up in 1 hour, okay?
- Yes... See you.

1090
01:20:52,187 --> 01:20:53,757
Not if I see you first!

1091
01:20:55,653 --> 01:20:57,360
Tel Aviv!

1092
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,699
Shalom, colleague!

1093
01:21:42,756 --> 01:21:44,929
- How are you?
- I'm exhausted.

1094
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,128
I haven't stopped.

1095
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:49,297
Just finished
separating Siamese twins.

1096
01:21:49,357 --> 01:21:51,893
Good to see you.
I'll buy you a drink.

1097
01:21:51,956 --> 01:21:54,403
I didn't come
to visit the parking lot.

1098
01:21:54,457 --> 01:21:56,130
Show me around.

1099
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:58,000
- But...
- Come on.

1100
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:02,836
You see...
A big corridor, the patients...

1101
01:22:02,891 --> 01:22:05,304
They're the nurses.

1102
01:22:06,891 --> 01:22:09,463
The rooms are very comfortable.

1103
01:22:10,657 --> 01:22:12,296
Who are you?

1104
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:14,031
Cheese, cheese.

1105
01:22:14,092 --> 01:22:16,971
He's an excellent proctologist.

1106
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:21,167
Okay, we'll see you for dinner.

1107
01:22:21,225 --> 01:22:23,000
It's the same on all five floors.

1108
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:25,335
How extraordinary!

1109
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,395
See you tonight.

1110
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,996
OK? Later.
Visit all five floors.

1111
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:43,700
Thanks, Alain.

1112
01:22:47,794 --> 01:22:50,832
Good to see you both
looking so happy.

1113
01:22:50,894 --> 01:22:53,807
I mean it, you've adapted very fast.

1114
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,399
At the time, I wouldn't have
bet a dime on your chances.

1115
01:22:59,594 --> 01:23:02,598
It's getting late.
When does your plane leave?

1116
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:04,505
No, we're not leaving for two days.

1117
01:23:05,795 --> 01:23:08,207
Great! Come to our place
for dinner tomorrow.

1118
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:12,440
No, that's not a very good idea.

1119
01:23:12,496 --> 01:23:14,999
Our furniture hasn't arrived yet.

1120
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:16,906
Come, anyway, and see the apartment.

1121
01:23:16,963 --> 01:23:20,500
No? How about a nightcap?
I feel like dancing.

1122
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,702
That's a great idea!

1123
01:23:22,762 --> 01:23:24,639
Let's not be a nuisance, hon.

1124
01:23:24,696 --> 01:23:27,200
Alain has to get up early for work.

1125
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:29,300
He showed me around.

1126
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:31,809
They're real specialists!

1127
01:23:31,863 --> 01:23:33,706
Tell me...

1128
01:23:33,762 --> 01:23:36,004
Do you communicate
in French or Hebrew?

1129
01:23:36,063 --> 01:23:38,043
Right!

1130
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:42,306
It's time for bed.
I need 8 hours' sleep...

1131
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:45,175
if I don't get 8 hours,
my hands shake.

1132
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:48,144
True. It's essential
in his line of work.

1133
01:23:48,198 --> 01:23:50,200
It's like washing cars.

1134
01:23:54,298 --> 01:23:56,938
Apart from the overalls.

1135
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:01,175
I don't work at the hospital.
I wash cars at the Intercontinental.

1136
01:24:06,965 --> 01:24:09,501
A doctor!

1137
01:24:09,564 --> 01:24:10,873
Excuse me.

1138
01:24:17,433 --> 01:24:19,970
Alain, I think
you should do something.

1139
01:24:22,532 --> 01:24:25,445
Go on, push!

1140
01:24:25,499 --> 01:24:28,106
Stop, stop. That's it.

1141
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:30,306
Deep breaths. Calm down.

1142
01:24:30,368 --> 01:24:35,283
Take your time. Breathe.
Easy now...

1143
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:40,509
Thanks...
OK, push, push, push!

1144
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:43,174
Push! Push, that's it!

1145
01:24:43,234 --> 01:24:48,479
Yes! That's it!

1146
01:24:48,534 --> 01:24:50,844
You've done it!

1147
01:24:50,901 --> 01:24:53,007
A fine boy!

1148
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:55,604
Hand me a cloth!

1149
01:24:59,202 --> 01:25:00,545
Thank you, Doctor!

1150
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:05,406
You have a boy. A handsome boy!

1151
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:25,280
What a nice surprise!
Do play a set with us.

1152
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:28,750
I filled up with air and gas
and vacuumed her. Here...

1153
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,442
Don't thank me.

1154
01:25:33,937 --> 01:25:35,917
Call me, okay?

1155
01:25:49,205 --> 01:25:53,051
I've nearly finished the first coat.
Come see.

1156
01:25:53,105 --> 01:25:54,550
What are you doing?

1157
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:59,415
Put that down. Give me your hand,
we're going. Enough.

1158
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:01,145
Going where?

1159
01:26:01,206 --> 01:26:02,616
Home. It's over.

1160
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:05,345
- Home?
- Home to France.

1161
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:07,682
Are you serious?

1162
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:11,448
Take a look around you.
What are we doing here?

1163
01:26:11,506 --> 01:26:15,080
There's nothing for us here.
We're not from here.

1164
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,983
Look at this place.

1165
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:22,614
All the tenants gave us their trash!
What is this painting?

1166
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:26,052
Do you like it?
It makes me feel sick!

1167
01:26:26,107 --> 01:26:28,678
I think it's pretty.

1168
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,948
You've changed, Giséle.

1169
01:26:31,008 --> 01:26:35,252
We have to leave. I got you a ticket.
The plane leaves in 4 hours.

1170
01:26:35,307 --> 01:26:38,152
We're going home,
back to our real life.

1171
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:42,350
- My real life is here.
- But what about mine?

1172
01:26:42,408 --> 01:26:45,151
Are you giving up
at the first hurdle?

1173
01:26:45,209 --> 01:26:47,313
What do you want to go back to?

1174
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:50,514
We spent 25 years looking,
we finally found it.

1175
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:52,577
And you don't even realize!

1176
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:57,986
Come on, we're going home.
Here...

1177
01:26:58,042 --> 01:26:59,851
You're not listening.

1178
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:02,083
Go if you want to. I'm staying.

1179
01:27:02,143 --> 01:27:03,621
You're not even a real Jew.

1180
01:27:09,509 --> 01:27:12,150
The flight's at 9:30.

1181
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:14,690
I'll wait for you at the airport.

1182
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:23,349
Last call for Mr. Alain Gaash.
Please come to Gate number eight.

1183
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:27,290
Flight AF722 boarding immediately

1184
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:30,257
for Paris Charles de Gaulle.
Thank you.

1185
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,684
Let's start again.

1186
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,626
Why did you check in that suitcase?

1187
01:28:20,647 --> 01:28:23,594
I've told you 100 times,
I'm going to Paris.

1188
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,752
- Why Paris?
- I live there.

1189
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:28,226
You live in Paris?

1190
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,486
I lived there.

1191
01:28:29,547 --> 01:28:31,424
You said you lived in Tel Aviv.

1192
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,893
Yes, I live in Tel Aviv.

1193
01:28:33,948 --> 01:28:35,928
Why were you going to Paris?

1194
01:28:37,848 --> 01:28:39,418
I don't know.

1195
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,018
You don't know why?

1196
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:45,086
Because I...

1197
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:47,321
Because you live there?

1198
01:28:47,381 --> 01:28:50,420
No, I... I live in Tel Aviv.

1199
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:54,324
Why didn't you get on the plane?

1200
01:28:54,382 --> 01:28:57,522
Why didn't you answer the calls?

1201
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,154
I didn't hear...

1202
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:02,218
I didn't understand.
My Hebrew is very bad.

1203
01:29:02,282 --> 01:29:04,228
You don't speak Hebrew?

1204
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:06,924
Very badly.

1205
01:29:06,983 --> 01:29:08,188
Prove it.

1206
01:29:12,384 --> 01:29:15,194
Can you make holes
in the universe with your eyes?

1207
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,522
We know
your mama sleeps with bunnies.

1208
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:25,392
We have the photos.

1209
01:29:30,052 --> 01:29:32,622
You're very good...

1210
01:29:37,019 --> 01:29:40,660
The travel agency said
they sold you 2 tickets.

1211
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,496
Yes.
It was for my wife.

1212
01:29:44,552 --> 01:29:46,589
For your wife?

1213
01:29:46,652 --> 01:29:49,031
Where is this wife?

1214
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,994
In Tel Aviv.

1215
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,259
Tel Aviv...

1216
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,028
Giséle Gaash,

1217
01:29:57,086 --> 01:30:00,499
née Carette.
36 Shalom Yehuda Street.

1218
01:30:00,553 --> 01:30:03,591
If you know the answers, why ask?

1219
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:07,864
Why did you come to Israel?
Are you Jewish?

1220
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:09,559
Yes, I am Jewish.

1221
01:30:09,621 --> 01:30:11,498
Do you know a Dr. Brant?

1222
01:30:14,288 --> 01:30:16,825
Yes, so what?

1223
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:18,594
He circumcised you...

1224
01:30:18,654 --> 01:30:21,134
recently.

1225
01:30:22,822 --> 01:30:27,327
You're not Jewish.
Who are you?

1226
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:30,665
Where are you from?
What do you want?

1227
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:34,000
I'm tired. I want to go home.

1228
01:30:34,056 --> 01:30:36,331
Home... Where's that?

1229
01:30:36,388 --> 01:30:38,425
Home...

1230
01:30:38,488 --> 01:30:40,935
I'm tired.

1231
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:42,866
I don't understand.

1232
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,531
Eat, Alain, eat.

1233
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:00,696
No...

1234
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,767
Can I have a cigarette?

1235
01:31:03,824 --> 01:31:05,428
Help yourself.

1236
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:07,300
Thanks.

1237
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,602
She's gone to her mother's,
she'll come back.

1238
01:31:22,658 --> 01:31:24,604
I know.

1239
01:31:26,491 --> 01:31:30,371
I'm not always a great husband...

1240
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:32,667
It's...

1241
01:31:32,726 --> 01:31:35,502
the build-up of stress...

1242
01:31:35,559 --> 01:31:37,835
No... It's...

1243
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:43,673
Don't belittle yourself,
don't make yourself feel guilty...

1244
01:31:43,727 --> 01:31:46,571
She just needs some time.

1245
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:50,130
She needs head space.
Understand?

1246
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:53,766
There always comes a time when...

1247
01:31:56,194 --> 01:31:58,937
when this happens.
It's only natural.

1248
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:09,471
Are you happy here?

1249
01:32:09,528 --> 01:32:11,405
It's okay.

1250
01:32:16,561 --> 01:32:18,234
Thank you.

1251
01:32:20,862 --> 01:32:22,933
Keep me posted, okay?

1252
01:32:25,028 --> 01:32:26,667
Thanks, Alain.

1253
01:32:44,197 --> 01:32:45,871
I understand.

1254
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,576
I'm staying here.

1255
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:53,909
You hear? I'm staying here.
Open up when you're ready.

1256
01:32:53,963 --> 01:32:56,774
Giséle go.

1257
01:32:59,998 --> 01:33:02,376
Giséle go!

1258
01:33:02,431 --> 01:33:05,743
Not understand? Giséle go!

1259
01:33:05,799 --> 01:33:07,106
Where?

1260
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:15,237
Giséle, stop!

1261
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:19,371
Giséle, you're making a big mistake.

1262
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:20,741
Giséle Gaash...

1263
01:33:20,799 --> 01:33:22,903
Running away isn't a solution.

1264
01:33:22,965 --> 01:33:25,674
Turn around.

1265
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:28,612
Turn around, Giséle Gaash.

1266
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,906
Giséle, turn around.

1267
01:34:30,236 --> 01:34:33,240
You were right.
We're staying, honey.

1268
01:34:33,303 --> 01:34:35,408
- No, we're leaving.
- We're staying.

1269
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,211
- We're leaving.
- We're staying!

1270
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,546
- Leaving.
- We're staying, honey.

1271
01:34:39,603 --> 01:34:41,879
Okay, if you want, we're staying.

1272
01:34:43,603 --> 01:34:45,048
Are you sure?

1273
01:36:21,677 --> 01:36:25,021
Will you ever leave me alone?

1274
01:36:25,076 --> 01:36:27,614
- No.
- Oh God.
