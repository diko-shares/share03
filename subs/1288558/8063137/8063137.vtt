1
00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:10.099
We caught the bitch.

2
00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:27.784
Please don't hurt me.

3
00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:30.828
Don't be afraid, girl.

4
00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:34.624
Who are you?

5
00:02:40.546 --> 00:02:42.006
Somebody please help me.

6
00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:48.012
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.

7
00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:50.807
Please. I just want to go home.

8
00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.812
Please. I just want to go home.

9
00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:06.322
Daddy?

10
00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:11.494
Daddy, why are you doing this to me?

11
00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.371
Who are these people?

12
00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.123
Look, they are good people.

13
00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.542
They are here to help.

14
00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.627
What are you talking about?

15
00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.546
Where's Mom?

16
00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:25.883
Mommy is dead, baby. You know that.

17
00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:33.141
- You killed her.
- What?

18
00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:34.392
You did.

19
00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.856
No, why are you saying these things?
Daddy, please, I just want go home.

20
00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:41.190
I just want to go home.

21
00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.360
Do it! It's the only way to save her soul!

22
00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:49.198
I'm so sorry, baby.

23
00:03:49.907 --> 00:03:51.200
Daddy, what is that?

24
00:03:57.748 --> 00:03:59.167
Daddy.

25
00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.878
Daddy, look at me. It's me.

26
00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:05.548
Do it! Give your daughter peace!

27
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.509
I just want you to hold me and take me home.

28
00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:10.887
Please.

29
00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:17.518
Please stop.

30
00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:22.398
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.

31
00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:28.738
I'll rip your soul out, you pathetic fuck!

32
00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:32.742
Motherfucker!

33
00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:35.244
I will kill you like I killed

34
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:38.122
your whore!

35
00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:43.628
Fuck!

36
00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:46.297
Fuck!

37
00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:56.432
I love you, baby.

38
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:26.897
Hey.

39
00:06:27.064 --> 00:06:29.191
How's it going, Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?

40
00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:31.360
- Hey, Olivia.
- Come here.

41
00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:33.446
Two arms, please. Like you missed me.

42
00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:37.783
This is my girl Natalie.

43
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.036
The heartbreaker from your car shop.

44
00:06:40.202 --> 00:06:41.454
The doctor?

45
00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:44.290
- Actually, she's...
- I'm a registered nurse.

46
00:06:44.457 --> 00:06:48.044
Nurse. Right, sorry.

47
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.129
You were supposed to be
here two hours ago, man.

48
00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:52.465
And that's our irresistibly charming Eric.

49
00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:55.092
Teaching high school finally turned
you into a bitter old coot, huh?

50
00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.762
No, you did.

51
00:06:57.928 --> 00:07:00.222
You kept us waiting here all morning.

52
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:03.476
Good to see you, too, man. Come here.

53
00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:05.936
You look good.

54
00:07:06.896 --> 00:07:09.649
She's waiting for you in the back.

55
00:07:10.316 --> 00:07:11.776
Great.

56
00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:26.999
Hey, Mia.

57
00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:30.169
I'll be damned.

58
00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:33.673
You actually came.

59
00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.800
Come on, I'm your big brother.

60
00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:37.426
Of course I came.

61
00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:39.804
I know I look like road kill.

62
00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:42.807
You look beautiful, as always.

63
00:07:42.973 --> 00:07:46.936
And you're a charming liar, as always.

64
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.272
Grandpa?

65
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.692
Hey.

66
00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:55.820
Hey, there buddy.

67
00:07:56.946 --> 00:07:59.448
We always loved this place, didn't we?

68
00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:02.284
He missed you a lot, you know.

69
00:08:05.663 --> 00:08:07.623
- Oh, my God.
- What?

70
00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:10.000
- What is that?
- What?

71
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.669
Just this, right here.

72
00:08:13.963 --> 00:08:16.298
It's not funny!

73
00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:22.054
This is made from a buckthorn tree.
It's supposed to make your will stronger.

74
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:24.014
But I thought
you didn't believe in that kind of stuff.

75
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:27.560
I don't. But you do, so, maybe it'll work.

76
00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:30.980
Okay.

77
00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:34.191
Well, then, let's do this.

78
00:08:40.156 --> 00:08:42.533
Promise me you'll stay with me until the end.

79
00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:45.828
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Cross your heart.

80
00:08:46.287 --> 00:08:47.455
Okay.

81
00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:50.791
Hope to die.

82
00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:55.171
Okay.

83
00:08:55.463 --> 00:08:59.842
May my friends and family witness this act,

84
00:09:00.217 --> 00:09:05.055
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment that...

85
00:09:08.517 --> 00:09:09.560
Fuck it.

86
00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:17.693
I promise not to touch this shit

87
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.529
ever again.

88
00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.368
Okay.

89
00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:30.873
Let's play cold turkey.

90
00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:39.507
Well,

91
00:09:40.257 --> 00:09:42.426
I know some slugs
are gonna have a party tonight.

92
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:44.762
David,

93
00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.682
Mia's about to go through
the worst three days of her life.

94
00:09:48.766 --> 00:09:52.061
Okay? Withdrawal's gonna
make her experience extreme body pain,

95
00:09:52.144 --> 00:09:56.065
vomiting, chills, paranoia...
It's not gonna be nice.

96
00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:58.484
- Why three days?
- Because after three days,

97
00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:00.736
the pain subsides.

98
00:10:01.612 --> 00:10:03.280
And she'll be off the hook for good.

99
00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:05.616
Mia's a strong girl. She'll be okay.

100
00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:07.076
Yeah.

101
00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:16.085
Hopefully, this still works.

102
00:10:20.256 --> 00:10:21.257
Wait.

103
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:36.814
Looks like someone broke in.

104
00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:39.233
Be careful.

105
00:10:49.952 --> 00:10:52.413
What is that smell?

106
00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:57.793
Some teenagers probably just broke in here
to drink beer and bump uglies.

107
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.420
Exactly.

108
00:11:24.987 --> 00:11:27.823
Mom would have hated
seeing the cabin like this.

109
00:11:28.157 --> 00:11:29.241
Okay.

110
00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:32.286
Let's make this place livable.

111
00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:54.725
<i>No, use my camera.</i>

112
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.018
<i>Fine, fine.</i>

113
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.353
<i>Hey!</i>

114
00:12:08.948 --> 00:12:10.157
Hey.

115
00:12:12.368 --> 00:12:13.619
Are you okay?

116
00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:18.165
Do you remember that lullaby
Mom used to sing us?

117
00:12:18.874 --> 00:12:20.542
It was something like...

118
00:12:21.794 --> 00:12:26.048
"Baby, little baby, it's time to say goodbye."

119
00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:30.052
"Baby, little baby..."

120
00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:34.306
Mia, please, I don't think you need
sad memories in your head right now.

121
00:12:34.682 --> 00:12:36.308
Mom is not a sad one.

122
00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:38.394
You know what I mean.

123
00:12:41.897 --> 00:12:44.733
You know what?
Her final days at the hospital...

124
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.988
Mom sometimes thought I was you.

125
00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:53.909
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.

126
00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:57.162
And I played along, because...

127
00:12:57.329 --> 00:13:00.833
Mia, look, I wanted to be there. Okay, I did.

128
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.252
But by the time Mom got bad,

129
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:05.921
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago.

130
00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:10.718
I don't know, I had a hard time finding
the right moment to come back.

131
00:13:12.177 --> 00:13:15.264
And then it was too late. So...

132
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.854
Maybe you were lucky,
not to see her the way that I did.

133
00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:58.140
It looks like she is doing okay.

134
00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:00.976
David, there is something you need to know.

135
00:14:03.812 --> 00:14:05.147
Okay.

136
00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:08.734
We already tried this whole thing
back in Flint last summer.

137
00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:12.446
Mia made the same promises.

138
00:14:12.613 --> 00:14:18.118
She took the same dramatic vow of sobriety
before chucking her dope down the toilet.

139
00:14:18.285 --> 00:14:20.329
She lasted eight hours and quit.

140
00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:25.292
So, we don't want to give her
that chance this time.

141
00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:27.669
What do you mean?

142
00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.339
David, when she breaks,

143
00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:33.008
and believe me, she will,

144
00:14:34.176 --> 00:14:36.637
we don't want to let her leave.

145
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:42.184
What do you mean?
You want force her to stay here?

146
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:43.644
Mia?

147
00:14:44.853 --> 00:14:47.356
This time the only way is the hard way, man.

148
00:14:47.523 --> 00:14:49.858
- She won't survive another OD.
- What?

149
00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:52.611
Mia OD'd?

150
00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:55.364
She didn't just OD.

151
00:14:55.531 --> 00:14:57.491
Legally, your sister died.

152
00:14:58.033 --> 00:15:00.202
They had to defibrillate her.

153
00:15:04.206 --> 00:15:05.791
Jesus.

154
00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:10.629
We all need to be together on this.
Otherwise it won't work.

155
00:15:11.463 --> 00:15:12.965
Good boy.

156
00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:16.051
I came here to make things
better with my sister, not worse.

157
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:24.143
If she asks me to take her home at some
point, I'm going to have to do it.

158
00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:29.064
I can't stand it! Fuck!

159
00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:31.567
- I can't stand it!
- Smell? What smell?

160
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:33.735
What the fuck is that smell?

161
00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:35.237
I know, I know.

162
00:15:36.822 --> 00:15:38.157
It's okay. It's okay.

163
00:15:38.574 --> 00:15:41.243
I can't stand that fucking smell anymore.

164
00:15:41.493 --> 00:15:43.495
Lie down, okay?

165
00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:45.998
We're here for you. I know, I know.

166
00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:50.169
We're all here.

167
00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:51.920
We're all here.

168
00:15:52.754 --> 00:15:55.424
We're not going anywhere.

169
00:16:02.347 --> 00:16:04.725
Withdrawal is kicking in hard.

170
00:16:04.892 --> 00:16:07.102
This should help you get through the night.

171
00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:10.439
I don't know what is wrong with you people,

172
00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:14.109
but there is something dead and it reeks.

173
00:16:14.443 --> 00:16:16.111
But there is no smell.

174
00:16:16.278 --> 00:16:17.779
You're just extra-sensitive right now.

175
00:16:18.113 --> 00:16:21.283
I just can't stand that fucking smell anymore.

176
00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:25.412
Wait.

177
00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:37.090
Is that blood?

178
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.941
Shit.

179
00:16:55.984 --> 00:16:58.820
What's your medical diagnosis now?

180
00:16:58.987 --> 00:17:01.615
It fucking stinks.

181
00:17:02.324 --> 00:17:03.825
Shit. Careful.

182
00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:06.036
These steps are old and rotten.

183
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.163
Yeah, like this whole freaking house.

184
00:17:08.247 --> 00:17:09.248
I know.

185
00:17:19.216 --> 00:17:21.343
It smells like burnt hair.

186
00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:24.012
I think it's back there.

187
00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:48.495
Oh, my God!

188
00:17:49.162 --> 00:17:50.163
Shit.

189
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:57.045
What is this?

190
00:17:57.504 --> 00:18:00.257
I don't know. Witchcraft?

191
00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:02.217
Who would do this?

192
00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:08.682
Shit, something burned here.

193
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.061
Look.

194
00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:19.359
Shit, man.

195
00:18:19.526 --> 00:18:22.070
What the fuck happened here?

196
00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:24.406
Let's not go crazy over this. Okay?

197
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.742
I'll bury those dead cats out back later.

198
00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:29.369
Yeah. The smell will be gone in no time.

199
00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:31.246
Yeah, okay.

200
00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:35.083
And what about the voodoo shit
they did down there?

201
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.420
No, no, no. Voodoo is more about dolls
and personal artifacts.

202
00:18:38.587 --> 00:18:41.381
- This is something different.
- Eric, that's enough.

203
00:18:43.592 --> 00:18:46.762
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

204
00:20:51.553 --> 00:20:54.848
<i>“Naturom Demonic</i>

205
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:46.942
"Kunda."

206
00:21:54.533 --> 00:21:55.534
"Astratta."

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:25.897
Please, God, give me a break.

210
00:22:32.737 --> 00:22:34.489
Mia.

211
00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:47.335
What are you doing?

212
00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:50.922
I'm sorry, but I have to get
out of here right now.

213
00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:53.008
No, come on.
The slumber party isn't over yet.

214
00:22:53.174 --> 00:22:55.302
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?

215
00:22:55.468 --> 00:22:56.636
Mia, please look...

216
00:22:56.803 --> 00:22:58.597
I'm going insane here.

217
00:22:58.763 --> 00:23:02.767
Olivia, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

218
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:03.852
Mia, what is it?

219
00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:09.482
I will go through with this, okay?

220
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.776
I just... I can't do it here.

221
00:23:12.193 --> 00:23:13.320
Mia,

222
00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:17.449
we have decided
we're not going to take you back.

223
00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:23.038
We can't lose you again.

224
00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:25.206
You're going to have to stick it out this time.

225
00:23:28.627 --> 00:23:30.170
David, drive me home.

226
00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:36.009
Come on, David.

227
00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:39.304
Mia, maybe they're right.

228
00:23:43.183 --> 00:23:46.895
You were supposed to be here
to support me, not them.

229
00:23:47.062 --> 00:23:48.063
I'm here for you, Mia.

230
00:23:48.229 --> 00:23:49.564
- That's why I came.
- Oh, my God.

231
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:51.566
I'm such an idiot.

232
00:23:51.733 --> 00:23:54.027
To think for once in my life,

233
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.529
I could count on you.

234
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:01.826
Mia, we're just trying to help you.

235
00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:04.037
Well, fuck you very much!

236
00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:12.212
Eric, leave her alone.

237
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.381
Mia.

238
00:24:27.394 --> 00:24:28.395
Mia!

239
00:24:31.648 --> 00:24:32.649
Perfect.

240
00:24:34.109 --> 00:24:35.860
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.

241
00:24:36.027 --> 00:24:37.362
Fuck!

242
00:24:38.196 --> 00:24:39.239
Fuck!

243
00:24:41.408 --> 00:24:45.453
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

244
00:26:28.556 --> 00:26:29.557
Mia!

245
00:26:32.894 --> 00:26:33.895
"Mia!
"Mia!

246
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:36.314
Mia.

247
00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:44.864
Mia!

248
00:27:46.634 --> 00:27:47.635
Mia.

249
00:28:39.646 --> 00:28:40.772
Mia!

250
00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:42.023
Mia!

251
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.691
Mia!

252
00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:49.364
- Mia!
- Shit.

253
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.118
Oh, my God.

254
00:29:04.045 --> 00:29:05.797
Hey, how's she doing?

255
00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:11.010
She's talking about a woman in the woods.
How the forest attacked her.

256
00:29:12.053 --> 00:29:14.138
I don't know. It's just crazy withdrawal talk.

257
00:29:14.472 --> 00:29:16.516
Don't you think we should
take her to a hospital?

258
00:29:16.683 --> 00:29:18.476
I feel like we're in over our heads here.

259
00:29:18.643 --> 00:29:22.647
Okay. I am giving her the exact same
treatment she would get at a hospital.

260
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.362
If we leave now, all of this mess
will have been for nothing.

261
00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:31.906
Okay. What about the wounds on her arms?

262
00:29:33.533 --> 00:29:35.326
I pulled some thorns out.

263
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.745
It looks like she might have
run into a thorn bush out there.

264
00:29:38.413 --> 00:29:40.248
She probably did it on purpose.

265
00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:42.250
What?

266
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.211
David,

267
00:29:46.212 --> 00:29:49.173
from now on, she is going to do
whatever it takes to get out of here.

268
00:30:07.567 --> 00:30:08.568
Mia.

269
00:30:10.945 --> 00:30:12.947
Listen, you've gotta get out of those clothes.

270
00:30:13.531 --> 00:30:14.574
All right? Take a shower.

271
00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:15.742
David.

272
00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:18.745
Please.

273
00:30:19.787 --> 00:30:21.080
Please.

274
00:30:22.749 --> 00:30:26.085
You have to get me...

275
00:30:27.086 --> 00:30:28.463
...out of here.

276
00:30:31.215 --> 00:30:32.800
Mia, look,
nobody said this was gonna be easy.

277
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.761
No.

278
00:30:37.597 --> 00:30:39.432
You don't understand.

279
00:30:40.266 --> 00:30:43.644
There was something in the woods, David.

280
00:30:48.608 --> 00:30:54.655
And I think it's in here with us now.

281
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.159
With me in the room?

282
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:14.926
Look. You know it's all in your head.

283
00:31:16.344 --> 00:31:17.762
Just try to get it together.

284
00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:24.435
You'll feel better tomorrow, okay?
You'll be glad we were such assholes.

285
00:31:27.396 --> 00:31:28.397
Okay.

286
00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:08.521
Eric, what are you doing?

287
00:32:08.688 --> 00:32:10.857
Please, would you just get rid of that thing?

288
00:32:11.023 --> 00:32:13.860
You should be downstairs helping
your friend clean up that mess.

289
00:32:14.527 --> 00:32:16.654
I don't know who you're talking about.

290
00:32:17.363 --> 00:32:19.824
Come on.
Don't act like you don't care about him.

291
00:32:19.907 --> 00:32:21.534
I know you do.

292
00:32:22.869 --> 00:32:27.707
I think we can all agree he hasn't cared
about us for the past freaking century.

293
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:30.751
Well, he's here now.

294
00:32:33.004 --> 00:32:34.213
Yeah.

295
00:32:35.256 --> 00:32:36.674
Truly amazing.

296
00:33:09.457 --> 00:33:10.625
Grandpa?

297
00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:17.548
Grandpa!

298
00:33:24.472 --> 00:33:25.765
Grandpa?

299
00:33:26.307 --> 00:33:28.392
Come here, boy.

300
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:29.644
Fuck.

301
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.988
Grandpa.

302
00:33:43.449 --> 00:33:44.909
No,no,no.

303
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.162
Hey, boy. Come here.

304
00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.463
What did you get into?

305
00:33:58.923 --> 00:33:59.966
Fuck.

306
00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:03.177
What happened?

307
00:34:24.198 --> 00:34:25.199
Mia?

308
00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:26.659
She's in the shower.

309
00:34:27.368 --> 00:34:29.662
What happened? David?

310
00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:33.040
Mia?

311
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.960
Mia, open the door.

312
00:34:39.672 --> 00:34:41.048
Hey, Mia, open the door.

313
00:34:42.008 --> 00:34:44.302
- Mia, open the door!
- David, what are you doing?

314
00:34:47.513 --> 00:34:49.557
David, stop and tell me what's going on.

315
00:34:49.724 --> 00:34:52.476
Mia, open the fucking door!

316
00:34:58.691 --> 00:34:59.692
Mia?

317
00:35:00.234 --> 00:35:01.736
Mia, open the fucking door!

318
00:35:01.902 --> 00:35:02.903
David!

319
00:35:05.323 --> 00:35:06.324
David!

320
00:35:07.658 --> 00:35:08.743
Stop it!

321
00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:10.036
Mia!

322
00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:15.916
Mia?

323
00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:18.586
Mia?

324
00:35:21.756 --> 00:35:22.757
Olivia!

325
00:35:25.009 --> 00:35:26.510
Holy shit!

326
00:35:26.677 --> 00:35:28.262
Mia!

327
00:35:39.857 --> 00:35:40.858
Shit.

328
00:35:42.068 --> 00:35:44.028
This is insane.

329
00:35:51.452 --> 00:35:52.620
Fuck. Where is it?

330
00:36:19.146 --> 00:36:20.815
This can't be happening.

331
00:36:48.217 --> 00:36:51.679
I gave her a sedative. So, she
should be out for a couple of hours.

332
00:36:52.847 --> 00:36:56.767
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

333
00:36:57.685 --> 00:36:59.228
This is so wrong.

334
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:01.313
Nobody could have known
she would do something so twisted!

335
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.315
No, you should have known!

336
00:37:03.482 --> 00:37:05.401
We've all been following your lead
since we got here.

337
00:37:07.778 --> 00:37:09.238
We should have left when Mia wanted to.

338
00:37:09.363 --> 00:37:12.783
Baby, please! Let's not lose our heads, okay?

339
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.911
With any luck,
it will stop raining in a couple of hours,

340
00:37:16.036 --> 00:37:18.914
and we'll be able to cross the creek in
the morning, and take her to a hospital.

341
00:37:19.081 --> 00:37:21.542
Okay? Everything is going to be fine.

342
00:37:22.376 --> 00:37:24.420
"Everything is going to be fine"?

343
00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:28.007
Everything is going to be fine.

344
00:37:30.176 --> 00:37:33.471
I don't know if you've noticed this,
but nothing has been fine.

345
00:37:34.513 --> 00:37:38.809
And everything has been
getting worse every second.

346
00:37:43.647 --> 00:37:44.648
Mia?

347
00:37:53.032 --> 00:37:54.033
Mia?

348
00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:57.077
What are you doing?

349
00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:03.959
Mia, put the gun down.

350
00:38:04.502 --> 00:38:06.128
Put the gun down, please.

351
00:38:11.842 --> 00:38:13.427
Mia.

352
00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:15.763
Put the fucking gun down!

353
00:38:24.772 --> 00:38:25.773
Die!

354
00:38:28.984 --> 00:38:31.570
One by one, we will take you!

355
00:38:35.032 --> 00:38:37.701
You are all going to die tonight.

356
00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:44.166
The gun. The gun, quick!

357
00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:46.168
Baby?

358
00:39:06.105 --> 00:39:07.106
Mia!

359
00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:21.829
- Let me out!
- She's totally psychotic.

360
00:39:22.246 --> 00:39:23.998
My God, what happened to her eyes?

361
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.676
What's she doing?

362
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.429
It sounds like
she's hitting herself against something.

363
00:39:38.596 --> 00:39:40.055
This is impossible.

364
00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:42.558
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep.

365
00:39:42.725 --> 00:39:44.393
Give her another shot!

366
00:39:45.853 --> 00:39:47.271
That could put her into a coma.

367
00:39:47.521 --> 00:39:49.815
For Christ's sakes, Olivia,
she's going to kill herself down there!

368
00:39:51.609 --> 00:39:52.818
Go get the shot!

369
00:39:55.029 --> 00:39:56.572
I gotta get the shrapnel out of my arm.

370
00:39:56.739 --> 00:39:58.741
What? I have tweezers in my purse.

371
00:40:00.284 --> 00:40:02.202
David. Listen to me.

372
00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:05.789
I don't think a tranquilizer is going to do shit.

373
00:40:06.915 --> 00:40:09.877
'Cause I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!

374
00:40:10.502 --> 00:40:12.963
I'm scared that what's happening to Mia
has something to do

375
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:15.174
with the fucking witchcraft in the basement!

376
00:41:38.757 --> 00:41:39.758
Olivia!

377
00:41:49.685 --> 00:41:51.103
Olivia?

378
00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:14.835
Olivia?

379
00:42:16.295 --> 00:42:17.629
Are you okay?

380
00:42:25.095 --> 00:42:26.096
Olivia?

381
00:42:48.494 --> 00:42:51.622
Olivia, what are you doing in there?

382
00:42:55.751 --> 00:42:56.752
Olivia.

383
00:43:00.339 --> 00:43:01.340
Olivia.

384
00:43:05.928 --> 00:43:07.262
Are you okay?

385
00:43:12.142 --> 00:43:14.061
Oh, my God!

386
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.814
Why the fuck did you do that?

387
00:43:39.628 --> 00:43:40.629
Kill him.

388
00:44:19.668 --> 00:44:20.669
No!

389
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:33.891
She tried to kill me.

390
00:44:34.182 --> 00:44:36.268
She tried to kill me.

391
00:44:53.493 --> 00:44:54.494
Fuck.

392
00:44:57.789 --> 00:44:59.207
You hold that. You got it?

393
00:45:10.886 --> 00:45:12.596
Hold it there, okay? Hold it.

394
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.181
Fuck it.

395
00:45:17.434 --> 00:45:21.813
David, I did something terrible.

396
00:45:23.315 --> 00:45:24.566
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.

397
00:45:24.733 --> 00:45:27.819
That thing I killed was not Olivia.

398
00:45:27.986 --> 00:45:29.237
He's losing too much blood.

399
00:45:29.404 --> 00:45:31.073
Baby, he needs water and sugar. Okay?

400
00:45:31.198 --> 00:45:32.199
Go.

401
00:45:32.991 --> 00:45:33.951
Go!

402
00:45:34.034 --> 00:45:35.285
Okay. Okay.

403
00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:40.207
- All right.
- David.

404
00:45:42.084 --> 00:45:45.045
I read a passage from that book.

405
00:45:45.212 --> 00:45:48.382
It was some sort of prayer.

406
00:45:49.508 --> 00:45:51.426
I released something, David.

407
00:45:53.553 --> 00:45:57.849
I released something evil.

408
00:46:58.535 --> 00:46:59.536
Natalie?

409
00:47:08.795 --> 00:47:09.796
Mia?

410
00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:12.591
Natalie.

411
00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:20.307
What am I doing down here?

412
00:47:21.933 --> 00:47:24.061
My leg hurts.

413
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:27.230
I can't move.

414
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:33.278
I'm going to come down there, okay?

415
00:47:35.155 --> 00:47:38.116
Why did you lock me down here?

416
00:47:38.742 --> 00:47:40.869
You were supposed to help me.

417
00:47:41.036 --> 00:47:43.663
Hey, we're trying to help you, okay?

418
00:47:44.498 --> 00:47:47.375
You were out of control, you know?

419
00:47:47.834 --> 00:47:50.504
You got violent
and we didn't know what else to do.

420
00:47:51.755 --> 00:47:55.550
Mia, look,
something really terrible has happened,

421
00:47:55.717 --> 00:47:57.594
and we have to get out of here now. Okay?

422
00:47:57.761 --> 00:48:02.265
You don't understand.
He's not going to let you leave!

423
00:48:04.476 --> 00:48:06.436
And he's not going to stop until he has you.

424
00:48:07.646 --> 00:48:09.481
Until he has all of you!

425
00:49:14.754 --> 00:49:15.755
Please...

426
00:49:21.261 --> 00:49:24.014
I can smell your filthy soul.

427
00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:00.634
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

428
00:50:19.444 --> 00:50:22.155
Why don't you come down here,
so I can suck your cock, pretty boy!

429
00:50:22.489 --> 00:50:23.531
Mia.

430
00:50:23.657 --> 00:50:25.450
Mia's not here, you fucking idiot!

431
00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:29.621
Your little sister is being raped in hell!

432
00:50:44.803 --> 00:50:47.555
Home. I want to go home.

433
00:51:18.211 --> 00:51:20.046
Thanks for the water.

434
00:51:30.223 --> 00:51:31.224
Eric.

435
00:51:33.268 --> 00:51:35.729
I don't know why,
but I thought this would end it.

436
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.818
But this book does not burn.

437
00:51:44.112 --> 00:51:46.364
It does not fucking burn.

438
00:51:49.743 --> 00:51:52.412
Tell me what's going on here.

439
00:52:05.258 --> 00:52:08.094
This book uses some...

440
00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:11.431
ancient alphabet.

441
00:52:11.598 --> 00:52:16.186
There's some translations, but...
Just scattered notes.

442
00:52:17.228 --> 00:52:19.147
They all refer to some...

443
00:52:20.565 --> 00:52:21.983
...evil entity.

444
00:52:22.984 --> 00:52:25.153
A taker of souls.

445
00:52:26.946 --> 00:52:28.448
A demon.

446
00:52:29.366 --> 00:52:30.367
It says...

447
00:52:32.827 --> 00:52:35.080
"Once he feasts on five souls,

448
00:52:35.246 --> 00:52:39.334
"the sky will bleed again
and the abomination

449
00:52:39.918 --> 00:52:41.628
"will rise from Hell."

450
00:53:28.383 --> 00:53:29.717
This is insane.

451
00:53:29.884 --> 00:53:34.347
This thing is attached to Mia's soul
like a leech.

452
00:53:34.514 --> 00:53:36.349
It's becoming her.

453
00:53:36.891 --> 00:53:41.813
If we want to stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

454
00:53:48.695 --> 00:53:51.156
I think we're going to have to kill her.

455
00:53:52.574 --> 00:53:53.867
What did you say?

456
00:53:54.033 --> 00:53:55.034
Everything says...

457
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:57.704
Eric! We're not going to fucking kill anybody!

458
00:53:58.246 --> 00:54:00.039
Are you listening to yourself?

459
00:54:01.749 --> 00:54:03.918
What about those dead cats
down in the basement?

460
00:54:04.085 --> 00:54:08.214
I mean, maybe they had some disease.
I mean, some virus that... It spread to Mia,

461
00:54:08.381 --> 00:54:11.593
and then she passed it to Olivia
when she puked all over her face!

462
00:54:12.552 --> 00:54:17.557
But what kind of a virus makes a person
cut off their face with a piece of glass?

463
00:54:20.935 --> 00:54:22.770
Oh, God.

464
00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:40.371
I don't know what we're
dealing with here, okay?

465
00:54:41.623 --> 00:54:45.251
But it stopped raining, and
in a couple of hours, the river will be clear,

466
00:54:45.418 --> 00:54:48.796
and we're going to get out of this place.
All of us.

467
00:54:49.422 --> 00:54:52.050
It doesn't matter where we go.

468
00:54:52.217 --> 00:54:54.761
If we don't do something right now,

469
00:54:54.928 --> 00:54:57.472
we are all going to be dead by then!

470
00:55:15.448 --> 00:55:17.867
Give me back...

471
00:55:19.118 --> 00:55:20.119
...my hand.

472
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.830
<i>We're gonna get you</i>

473
00:55:23.289 --> 00:55:26.084
<i>Not another peep</i>

474
00:55:26.626 --> 00:55:29.337
<i>Time to go to sleep</i>

475
00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:30.797
Sleep.

476
00:55:31.089 --> 00:55:32.674
Sleep. Sleep.

477
00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:50.817
Don't do it, you little bitch! Don't cut it off!

478
00:55:59.742 --> 00:56:00.910
Don't cut it off!

479
00:56:01.536 --> 00:56:02.662
FUCK you!

480
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:11.879
No,no,no!

481
00:56:14.674 --> 00:56:15.675
No!

482
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:42.785
I had to do it. And I feel much better now.

483
00:56:55.757 --> 00:56:58.384
Hold on, baby. Hold on, please.

484
00:56:58.843 --> 00:57:02.263
Eric and I are going to
put a stop to this, okay?

485
00:57:02.972 --> 00:57:05.058
I promise that everything is going to be fine.

486
00:57:05.224 --> 00:57:06.976
Okay? Okay, baby?

487
00:57:07.935 --> 00:57:10.897
She just cut her fucking arm off.

488
00:57:11.064 --> 00:57:13.024
Does that sound fine?

489
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.914
These inscriptions are confusing,
sometimes contradictory,

490
00:57:28.081 --> 00:57:30.083
but they are consistent about one thing.

491
00:57:31.584 --> 00:57:36.255
In order to stop this,
the possessed must be cleansed.

492
00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:38.800
Purified.

493
00:57:39.133 --> 00:57:41.678
The book describes three specific ways.

494
00:57:44.555 --> 00:57:46.057
A live burial.

495
00:57:50.603 --> 00:57:52.313
Bodily dismemberment.

496
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.649
<i>Bodily dismemberment.</i>

497
00:57:58.277 --> 00:58:01.072
And purification by fire.

498
00:58:05.118 --> 00:58:06.327
Are you sure this will work?

499
00:58:08.705 --> 00:58:09.831
If we...

500
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.838
If I kill my sister, she will be at peace?

501
00:58:17.004 --> 00:58:20.383
Am I sure? Of course not.

502
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:22.135
This is not a science book!

503
00:58:23.428 --> 00:58:25.304
But look, I'm sure of one thing.

504
00:58:25.471 --> 00:58:29.726
Whatever is inside Mia
is the cause of all this.

505
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.563
If she dies, then this thing
is going to die with her.

506
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:35.898
What if she just lost her mind?

507
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:39.944
What if she just needs a doctor?

508
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:41.696
What? A doctor?

509
00:58:43.573 --> 00:58:46.534
My mom died in a mental hospital.
She was crazy.

510
00:58:47.076 --> 00:58:49.537
She was deranged, she was a monster.

511
00:58:51.414 --> 00:58:54.292
I've always feared that me
and Mia would end up like her.

512
00:58:54.834 --> 00:58:57.587
So... Okay, so, Mia went crazy.

513
00:58:57.962 --> 00:59:00.423
Okay. What about Olivia?
What about Natalie?

514
00:59:02.383 --> 00:59:05.052
Maybe we've all gone crazy.

515
00:59:14.103 --> 00:59:18.191
You are just a fucking coward.

516
00:59:18.357 --> 00:59:20.735
You know exactly what we have to do,

517
00:59:20.902 --> 00:59:23.946
but you're too scared to go through with it.

518
00:59:24.113 --> 00:59:26.699
I'm going to burn this fucking place down.

519
00:59:26.866 --> 00:59:29.452
And I'm going to end this nightmare.

520
00:59:30.536 --> 00:59:33.706
Why don't you just run away?

521
00:59:33.915 --> 00:59:37.126
Go hide beneath some rock somewhere.

522
00:59:37.293 --> 00:59:39.629
You know you're great at that.

523
00:59:45.718 --> 00:59:47.220
Oh, shit.

524
01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:05.047
Where the fuck did she go?

525
01:01:05.548 --> 01:01:06.674
David.

526
01:01:08.134 --> 01:01:10.511
Take it before she does.

527
01:01:43.502 --> 01:01:45.129
Want to play, little man?

528
01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:49.342
No!

529
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:53.304
Stop!

530
01:02:03.022 --> 01:02:04.315
No,no,no!

531
01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:39.892
David.

532
01:02:47.566 --> 01:02:49.276
Why are you hurting me?

533
01:02:57.326 --> 01:02:59.245
My face hurts.

534
01:03:01.163 --> 01:03:02.415
Why?

535
01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:07.920
Why... Why does my face hurt?

536
01:03:09.505 --> 01:03:10.506
Baby.

537
01:03:12.299 --> 01:03:13.300
Nat.

538
01:03:48.294 --> 01:03:51.297
Come on, man. Here we are.

539
01:03:55.968 --> 01:03:58.137
Hey. Hold on.

540
01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:00.639
Don't die on me, please!

541
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:03.893
Dying wouldn't be so bad right now.

542
01:04:06.562 --> 01:04:10.399
I just don't want to become the devil's bitch.

543
01:04:14.528 --> 01:04:16.322
I'm going to do what I got to do.

544
01:04:18.491 --> 01:04:20.993
I'm going to do what I got to do. Okay?

545
01:06:05.598 --> 01:06:07.141
I'm sorry, Mia.

546
01:06:08.642 --> 01:06:09.768
I love you.

547
01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:15.816
<i>Baby, little baby</i>

548
01:06:15.983 --> 01:06:19.028
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

549
01:06:20.154 --> 01:06:24.116
<i>Baby, little baby</i>

550
01:06:24.283 --> 01:06:27.661
<i>I'll miss you day and night</i>

551
01:06:28.204 --> 01:06:30.789
<i>Baby, my sweet baby</i>

552
01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:34.793
<i>I'll write you every day</i>

553
01:06:35.628 --> 01:06:39.632
<i>Baby, don't cry, baby</i>

554
01:06:40.466 --> 01:06:43.552
<i>I wish that I could stay</i>

555
01:06:44.345 --> 01:06:45.638
I can't do this.

556
01:06:48.474 --> 01:06:50.059
I can't do this.

557
01:07:24.176 --> 01:07:28.430
This time,
the only fucking way is the hard way!

558
01:08:09.096 --> 01:08:10.889
<i>David.</i>

559
01:08:12.099 --> 01:08:14.393
<i>Murderer.</i>

560
01:08:16.103 --> 01:08:17.730
<i>Coward.</i>

561
01:10:20.018 --> 01:10:21.520
Eric.

562
01:10:41.748 --> 01:10:42.749
Hey. Okay?

563
01:10:45.794 --> 01:10:46.879
David.

564
01:10:48.797 --> 01:10:50.424
I missed you, man.

565
01:10:54.761 --> 01:10:57.055
You know that, buddy.

566
01:12:17.302 --> 01:12:18.470
David?

567
01:12:20.973 --> 01:12:22.558
David?

568
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.270
I can't move! I can't breathe!

569
01:12:26.812 --> 01:12:27.813
David!

570
01:12:29.022 --> 01:12:30.774
Help me!

571
01:12:32.025 --> 01:12:33.735
Help me, David!

572
01:12:34.069 --> 01:12:35.404
You're not her.

573
01:12:35.571 --> 01:12:36.780
David!

574
01:12:37.656 --> 01:12:38.657
Help me!

575
01:12:39.533 --> 01:12:40.867
You're not her!

576
01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:49.710
Why do you hate me, David?

577
01:12:52.337 --> 01:12:54.131
I know you do.

578
01:12:55.632 --> 01:12:57.467
You left home.

579
01:12:58.552 --> 01:13:03.056
You left me all alone with our sick mother.

580
01:13:03.223 --> 01:13:04.808
And I was just a kid.

581
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:08.061
You made me lie.

582
01:13:09.855 --> 01:13:14.401
Every time she screamed your name,
I told her you were coming to see her.

583
01:13:15.235 --> 01:13:17.613
Like you promised.

584
01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.032
But you never did.

585
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:24.411
Please stop it, I'm begging you.

586
01:13:25.871 --> 01:13:30.876
I know Mother hates you now,
and she waits for you in hell.

587
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.345
Shut up.

588
01:13:41.428 --> 01:13:43.847
You will burn, David.

589
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.892
You will burn in hell
alongside yourjunkie sister!

590
01:13:47.434 --> 01:13:48.727
Shut up.

591
01:13:49.436 --> 01:13:52.814
You're gonna burn in hell
for trying to kill me, you motherfucker!

592
01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:11.583
I'm so sorry.

593
01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:17.214
I should have been there.

594
01:14:19.216 --> 01:14:21.802
I should have been there for you.

595
01:15:16.982 --> 01:15:18.650
Come on. Please, come back.

596
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:27.909
Come on, Mia. Come back to me, please!

597
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.914
Okay, you are at peace.

598
01:16:15.373 --> 01:16:17.209
You are at peace now.

599
01:16:43.902 --> 01:16:44.903
David?

600
01:16:51.576 --> 01:16:52.911
Mia?

601
01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:01.419
It was so horrible.

602
01:17:03.421 --> 01:17:05.590
It was so horrible.

603
01:17:06.258 --> 01:17:09.803
It's okay. It's all over now.

604
01:17:13.265 --> 01:17:16.184
Thanks for not leaving me, David.

605
01:17:24.776 --> 01:17:27.612
Wait here. I'm going to get the car keys.

606
01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:29.531
- Okay?
- Yeah.

607
01:18:33.345 --> 01:18:34.346
David!

608
01:18:35.263 --> 01:18:37.140
- Go. Please, go.
- No, no, no.

609
01:18:37.223 --> 01:18:38.224
Go!

610
01:18:38.558 --> 01:18:41.770
I'm not going to go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!

611
01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:48.109
Here, take the keys. Look at me, let's go.

612
01:18:48.276 --> 01:18:49.861
Come on. Let's go.

613
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.077
Get out of here.

614
01:18:58.453 --> 01:19:01.581
No! No!

615
01:19:01.748 --> 01:19:02.874
David!

616
01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.543
David!

617
01:19:09.047 --> 01:19:11.549
No! No!

618
01:19:11.925 --> 01:19:15.095
David! David!

619
01:19:24.145 --> 01:19:26.731
He's coming.

620
01:22:29.747 --> 01:22:31.916
Mia.

621
01:23:30.642 --> 01:23:32.185
Come here, you bitch!

622
01:24:57.562 --> 01:24:58.813
Come on.

623
01:25:56.788 --> 01:25:59.540
You're going to die here, you patheticjunkie!

624
01:26:01.959 --> 01:26:04.629
I've had enough of this shit.

625
01:26:43.751 --> 01:26:47.255
I will feast on your soul.

626
01:26:50.299 --> 01:26:52.510
Feast on this, motherfucker!

627
01:27:04.772 --> 01:27:06.607
Die!

628
01:27:27.503 --> 01:27:29.547
Go back to Hell, bitch.

629
01:31:43.676 --> 01:31:45.636
Are you okay, kiddo?

630
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.639
Help me.

631
01:31:51.809 --> 01:31:53.144
God Almighty.

632
01:31:55.688 --> 01:31:56.939
Don't you worry, kid.

633
01:31:57.314 --> 01:32:00.151
I'm taking you to the hospital,
and they'll patch you up in no time.

634
01:32:00.568 --> 01:32:01.986
You'll be right as rain.

635
01:34:36.307 --> 01:34:41.228
<i>I believe I have made a significant
find in the Candarian Ruins...</i>

636
01:34:41.395 --> 01:34:45.983
<i>A volume of ancient Sumerian burial
practices and funerary incantations.</i>

637
01:34:46.609 --> 01:34:49.653
<i>It is entitled "Naturom Demonto."</i>

638
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.406
<i>Roughly translated, "Book of the Dead."</i>

639
01:34:52.573 --> 01:34:56.577
<i>The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.</i>

640
01:34:56.911 --> 01:35:00.205
<i>It deals with demons, demon resurrection,</i>

641
01:35:00.372 --> 01:35:04.335
<i>those forces which roam the forest
and dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

642
01:35:05.294 --> 01:35:08.339
<i>The first few pages warn
that these enduring creatures</i>

643
01:35:08.505 --> 01:35:11.508
<i>may lie dormant, but are never truly dead.</i>

644
01:35:12.092 --> 01:35:16.555
<i>They may be recalled to active life through
the incantations presented in this book.</i>

645
01:35:16.722 --> 01:35:20.726
<i>It is through recitation of these passages
that the demons are given license</i>

646
01:35:21.393 --> 01:35:23.354
<i>to possess the living.</i>

647
01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:59.473
<i>I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods,</i>

648
01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.519
<i>and I have no doubt that whatever
I have resurrected through this book</i>

649
01:36:03.686 --> 01:36:06.939
<i>is sure to come calling for me.</i>

650
01:36:17.908 --> 01:36:19.451
Groovy.
