You'd get your first look
at this 6-foot turkey
as you enter a clearing.

97
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.974
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

98
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.478
You keep still because you
think maybe his visual acuity
is based on movement,

99
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:02.314

and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

101

You stare at him
and he just stares
right back.

And that's when
the attack comes.

103
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.285
Not from the front,
but from the side.

104
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.706
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even
know were there.

105
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.209
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

106
00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:24.920
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

107
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.423
and he is out
in force today.

108
00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.926
And he slashes at you
with this,

109
00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:35.514
a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor,
on the middle toe.

110
00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:39.643
He doesn't bother
to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

show a little respect.

Now, I'll get right
to the point.

Both of you.

155
00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.839
I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.

156
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.095
I own an island
off the coast
of Costa Rica.

157
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:24.183
I've leased it from
the government and during
the last five years,

158
00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.769
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

159
00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.229
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

160
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:32.775
Make the one
I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

161
00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:37.029
And there's no doubt
our attractions will drive
kids out of their minds.

162
00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.614

163
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.491
Small versions of
adults, honey.

164
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.493
And not just kids, everyone.

165
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.913
We're going to open next year,
if the lawyers
don't kill me first.

Don't really know any.

168

and packaged it

507
00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:58.322

on a plastic lunch box,
now you're selling it.

508
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.157
You're going to sell it.

509
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.910

you're giving us
our due credit.

510
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.413
Our scientists have
done things which nobody
has ever done before.

511
00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:09.750
But your scientists
were so preoccupied
with whether they could,

512
00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:12.086
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

513
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.090
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

514
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.052
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

515

you wouldn't have
anything to say.

516

Hold on,
this isn't some species
that was obliterated

517
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:27.768
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

518
00:36:27.894 --> 00:36:32.731
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them
for extinction.

519
00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:38.946
I don't understand
this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

520
00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:43.951
How can we stand
in the light of discovery
and not act?

521
00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:45.494
What's so great
about discovery?

522
00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:47.705
It's a violent,
penetrative act,

523
00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:51.417
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

524
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.212
I call the rape of
the natural world.

525
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:59.884
The question is, how can
you know anything about
an extinct eco-system?

526
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:03.137
And therefore,
how could you ever assume
that you can control it?

527
00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:06.223
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

528
00:37:06.308 --> 00:37:07.766
You picked them
because they look good.

529
00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:11.937
But these are aggressive
living things that have no
idea what century they're in

530

Violently, if necessary.

one person here

what I am trying to do...

so radically and we're all
running to catch up.

to any conclusions,

by 65 million years
of evolution

thrown back into
the mix together.

537

How can we possibly
have the slightest idea
what to expect?

538
00:37:47.724 --> 00:37:49.934
I don't believe it.

turned into birds and
