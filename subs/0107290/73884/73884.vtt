1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:02,856
Things are going to change.

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:07,056
His medical needs will change.
He's going to need palliative care.

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:10,936
You know, you could show a bit
more interest once in a while, Cad.

4
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:12,577
Seriously, Elin?

5
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,537
Argh!

7
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,576
- Where's dad?
- In bed.

8
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,696
Wanted to have an early night.

9
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,057
I thought you'd be in work.

10
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:11,257
I still am at work.

11
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,736
You could have called,
you know, if you were free.

12
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,656
I wasn't trying to avoid you, Elin.

13
00:02:18,657 --> 00:02:21,137
- Really?
- Yes, really.

14
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,257
So, what do you want to talk about?

15
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,377
I want to talk about Dad.

16
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,056
What else is there to talk about?

17
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:03,137
OK. Well, you saw how Beth was.

18
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,256
I've tried to talk to her,
but she doesn't want to listen.

19
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,056
- She needs more time.
- Dad doesn't have more time.

20
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,536
- Jesus, Els.
- Well, I'm sorry, Cad, but it's true.

21
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:19,296
He's going to deteriorate fast,
and we need to be prepared.

22
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,656
Dad needs a proper care plan

23
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:25,256
and then maybe we can at least focus on...

24
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:26,297
Dying?

25
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:28,977
On each other.

26
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:40,057
You've got to talk to him, Cad.

27
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,417
And what makes you think
he'll listen to me?

28
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,617
Cos you're his favourite.

29
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:50,377
That's not true.

30
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:52,457
Of course it is.

31
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:55,977
You were always his golden girl, Cad.

32
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,377
And even after all that
praise he gave you...

33
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:07,056
what did you do? You dropped out
of uni and joined the bloody Army.

34
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,697
Here we go again.

35
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,217
It wasn't personal, you know.

36
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,497
You mean, it wasn't personal to you.

37
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:30,776
I need a cigarette.

38
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,279
- I thought you were giving up.
- Yeah, I am.

39
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:34,533
- I'm trying.
- Yeah, well, try a bit harder, then.

40
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,097
Yeah, I will do.

41
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,737
I can see Dad's been busy.

42
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,457
Yeah.

43
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,616
Listen, Els, I...

44
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm getting a divorce.

45
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:05,817
What?

46
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,257
It's OK. We're not, um...

47
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:12,377
Well, we're not fighting.

48
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,657
We're not even talking that much, either.

49
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:20,377
That's the problem, I suppose...

50
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,256
We just...

51
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,377
fell apart.

52
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:32,136
- I'm sorry.
- We've decided not to tell Dad.

53
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,017
He doesn't need to know.

54
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,097
He liked Rhyds.

55
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:41,737
So did I.

56
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,217
That's why I married him.

57
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:51,297
I do want to help, you know?

58
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,097
With Dad.

59
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,697
I just...

60
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:02,937
I don't know where to start sometimes.

61
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:06,297
Well, just start by talking to him.

62
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,457
Please.

63
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,417
Hiya!

64
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:26,417
Dad?

65
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:58,417
Dad?

66
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:03,657
Dad?

67
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,417
DI John.

68
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,496
What have we got?

69
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:54,136
Attempted abduction of Lowri Driscoll, 23.

70
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,776
What, are we thinking this is
related to the Mali Pryce case?

71
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,976
Possibly. Lowri Driscoll is young,
she has dark hair,

72
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:02,416
she has resemblance to the Pryce girl.

73
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,297
Similar age, similar build.

74
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:09,377
- Assailant?
- Male, tall, and that's all we know.

75
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,536
Where's the girl now?

76
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:14,976
She's in hospital.
One of the FOs is with her now.

77
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,577
DS Vaughan.

78
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,777
I went to see my mother...

79
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:16,417
drove to the farm after work.

80
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:20,897
I left work around six...

81
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:26,857
30. I got to my mother's
around seven, I think.

82
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,536
My mother,

83
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:34,097
she wanted me to stay for food,
but I wasn't hungry.

84
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,297
I just wanted to go home.

85
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,137
I think I left around nine.

86
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,736
I waited a bit because my mum said

87
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,977
that my dad would be home around eight.

88
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,297
But he wasn't.

89
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,097
So I just... left.

90
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,297
And what happened next?

91
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,017
When I left, it was raining.

92
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:21,257
I drove up the lane, to
the gate at the top.

93
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:33,456
I go out the car, to open it, and then...

94
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:35,696
when I...

95
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,817
when I went to close
it again, he just...

96
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,616
he just came out of nowhere.

97
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:44,177
Did you see his face?

98
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,657
I know this is tough, Lowri...

99
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,656
but can you think of anyone,
anyone at all,

100
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,977
that would want to hurt you?

101
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,137
Lowri?

102
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:06,376
My ex.

103
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:07,977
Marc.

104
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,137
Marc Lewis.

105
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:17,857
We went out with each other
for a couple of months.

106
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:22,537
It was intense. He was intense.

107
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,897
Obsessive.

108
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,057
And you broke up with him?

109
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,417
He went nuts.

110
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,056
He's been hounding me,

111
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,657
calling me all the time.

112
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,377
At home, work...

113
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:47,136
sending abusive texts,
leaving nasty messages.

114
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,337
Just making threats.

115
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:55,776
Last night, he smashed my car.

116
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:58,577
- Did you report it?
- Yeah.

117
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:04,256
When was the last time you
spoke to Marc? Saw him?

118
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:05,657
Earlier this evening...

119
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,697
at the end of my shift.

120
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,417
He just turned up...

121
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:16,497
started screaming and shouting.

122
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,137
That's why I went to see my mum.

123
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,216
I was upset.

124
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,377
I needed someone to talk to.

125
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:41,216
Do you think Marc might
have had anything to do with

126
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:42,737
what happened to you tonight?

127
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,977
I don't know.

128
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:12,377
OK.

129
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,176
Shit.

130
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:26,217
What?

131
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,737
I know him. He's an estate agent.

132
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,977
He showed me and Sam some house in
Beaumaris the weekend before last.

133
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:38,016
Are you house-hunting? You kept that quiet.

134
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,257
Well, yeah.

135
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,576
And what is it like, this house?

136
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,657
It was all right. Wasn't worth
the money they were asking.

137
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,377
Sam liked it.

138
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:59,576
OK.

139
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,497
Let's get on with it, then.

140
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,016
What's this about? It's
7:30 in the morning.

141
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:13,297
- I've got work at nine.
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Lewis.

142
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:19,817
Well?

143
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,697
We appreciate you coming in to talk to us.

144
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:35,337
My name is DI Cadi John and this
is my colleague, DS Owen Vaughan.

145
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,376
Could you tell us where
you were last night,

146
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:43,216
Wednesday the 18th of October,
between the hours of 9 and 10pm?

147
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:46,656
- Why?
- Because at 9:20pm yesterday evening,

148
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,896
Lowri Driscoll was assaulted

149
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:52,016
on the road outside Nantlle.
She was leaving her parents' farm.

150
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,856
What's that got to do with me?

151
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:58,136
We understand that you and Lowri had
been in a relationship together,

152
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,737
which Lowri ended recently.

153
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,856
So what? We spent a few weekends together,

154
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,136
went out a couple of times.

155
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,976
- Nothing much, big deal.
- So is that why you kept pestering her

156
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:10,816
- after she dumped you?
- Is that what she told you?

157
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:14,416
She said that you wouldn't leave her alone.

158
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:15,457
Kept calling her.

159
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,576
Bombarding her with abusive texts.

160
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:19,697
Bombarding?!

161
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:23,416
OK, so I sent some stupid texts.

162
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,336
I was pissed off, that's all.

163
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:27,376
Because she didn't want
you in her life any more?

164
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:28,936
Because she wouldn't tell me why.

165
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,936
And is that why you started
following her, Mr Lewis?

166
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:35,016
Calling her at work, at home,
all hours of the day?

167
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:35,985
- No.
- Threatening her?

168
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,993
- No!
- Smashing up her car?

169
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,216
That wasn't me!

170
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,417
Christ, how many times do
I have to tell you lot?

171
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:47,296
When was the last time
you saw Lowri, Mr Lewis?

172
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:48,896
- Yesterday afternoon.
- What time?

173
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,896
- About half five.
- And what did you speak about?

174
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:53,776
She sent some of your lot to
the office where I worked.

175
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,337
I just wanted to let her know...
enough was enough.

176
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,897
Enough was enough.

177
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,216
And, um...

178
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,856
After you had spoken to Lowri,

179
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:06,336
after you'd told her
that enough was enough,

180
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,016
what did you do then?

181
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,777
- Went home.
- Did you see anyone?

182
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,937
Speak to anyone? Can anyone
vouch for your whereabouts?

183
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,097
No.

184
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,536
This is becoming ridiculous.

185
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:22,616
You drag me out of bed at half six
in the morning, bring me here,

186
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:24,696
ask me all these idiotic questions!

187
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:27,536
What happened to Lowri last
night had nothing to do with me.

188
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,136
I wasn't there.
What more can I say?

189
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:32,496
Now, charge me with a crime, or let me go.

190
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:34,856
Because I know my rights and
I'm done playing this game.

191
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:37,777
Well, unfortunately for you,
Mr Lewis, this isn't a game.

192
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,896
And we have the right to
keep you for questioning,

193
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:43,937
for...

194
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,896
what is it again? 24 hours

195
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:50,536
before we have to decide
whether to charge you or not,

196
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:53,736
so if I were you,
I would make myself comfortable

197
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:57,857
because you're going to be
here for a good while yet.

198
00:22:17,977 --> 00:22:19,776
This is bullshit!

199
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:22,736
How many times do I have to tell
you I had fuck all to do with it?

200
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:25,256
- I never touched the bitch!
- My heart bleeds for you, Mr Lewis.

201
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,617
Fuck off!

202
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:32,857
Get off me! Get your hands off me!

203
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:38,297
I want to see me solicitor.
Get my fucking solicitor!

204
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:41,857
You OK?

205
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,617
Yeah, that woke me up a bit.

206
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:51,377
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

207
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,377
- What the fuck do you want?
- Calm yourself down.

208
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,136
You saw what that crazy bitch did.

209
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:09,376
- She attacked me.
- None of this is helping, Mr Lewis.

210
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:10,776
Fuck.

211
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,136
Fuck!

212
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,457
Calm down.

213
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,136
Look, this is nuts.

214
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:20,296
I don't belong here.
I haven't done anything wrong.

215
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:23,216
Well, I'm sure we'll get this
sorted in no time, Mr Lewis.

216
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:24,257
Wait, wait, stop.

217
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:28,296
Listen.

218
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:30,376
When I was with Lowri yesterday,

219
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:33,016
as I was driving off, as I was leaving,

220
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,336
- I saw this bloke.
- OK?

221
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,833
He was sat in some shitty
pick-up truck and, I don't know,

222
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:40,776
it was like he was watching us.

223
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:42,616
I didn't think much of it at the time.

224
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,736
But there was something
not quite right about him.

225
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:47,537
I don't suppose you remember
what this man looked like?

226
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,856
Can you describe the truck?

227
00:23:50,857 --> 00:23:53,617
Old, rusted. Red, I think.

228
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,256
So, what do you say?

229
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:01,496
I mean, I have helped you out here, right?

230
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:03,697
Maybe you could put in a good word for me.

231
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,697
Have a lie down, Mr Lewis.

232
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:09,337
Make yourself comfortable.

233
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,696
You think I don't remember you?!

234
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:19,856
I know who you are! Saw the
way you were with your missus.

235
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:22,176
You've got a bitch at home
telling you what to do

236
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:24,056
and a bitch at work bossing you about.

237
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:25,737
You want to grow some balls, man!

238
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:05,697
Desk, chair...

239
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:11,336
bed...

240
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:13,097
lamp...

241
00:25:14,857 --> 00:25:16,577
mirror, window.

242
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:22,977
Desk, chair...

243
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:26,656
bed...

244
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,416
lamp...

245
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,776
mirror...

246
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,977
window.

247
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:36,096
Desk.

248
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,377
Chair.

249
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,056
Bed.

250
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:43,456
Lamp.

251
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:44,617
Mirror.

252
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:47,977
Window.

253
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:51,897
Desk.

254
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:57,417
Chair.

255
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:14,617
Get up.

256
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:17,817
Get out.

257
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:23,497
Get on with your life.

258
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,817
You can't sit in here all day.

259
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:47,976
Dylan?

260
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:49,297
Dylan!

261
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:23,777
Bloody hell!

262
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,817
Sorry, sorry, sorry...

263
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,297
The boss wants to see us.

264
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:33,897
Are you coming?

265
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:43,136
I've got a senior meeting in ten minutes.

266
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:46,376
So, where are we with Mali
Pryce and Lowri Driscoll?

267
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:49,336
Do we think the cases
are linked in some way?

268
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:51,696
We haven't been able to
establish a connection yet.

269
00:31:51,697 --> 00:31:55,056
But less than 48 hours after the
body of Mali Pryce is found,

270
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:58,416
we have another young woman
bearing a striking resemblance

271
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,816
to the Pryce girl being
attacked in what presents

272
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:04,136
as an attempted abduction...
It just cannot be a coincidence.

273
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:07,097
So, a man is doing what -
looking for a replacement?

274
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,016
Where are we with Marc Lewis?

275
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:13,216
He claims to have been
home alone all night.

276
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:15,776
Yeah, we are holding him for 24 hours,
while we check his story.

277
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,136
Has he given us anything?

278
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,576
He and Lowri had some big
fight yesterday afternoon.

279
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,856
When he was leaving,
he claims to have seen someone.

280
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,416
Some guy in a red pick-up truck.

281
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:26,176
Marc got the impression this
man wasn't there by chance,

282
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,496
that he'd been watching them for a while.

283
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:30,336
Could be something, might be nothing.

284
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:31,736
But, when we spoke to Lowri,

285
00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:34,096
she said the man who
attacked her was driving

286
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:36,456
what she thought was
dark-coloured pick-up truck.

287
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:38,336
Any progress in finding this truck?

288
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:41,416
We're checking Lowri's movements
over the last 48 hours

289
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,336
to see if anyone was following her.

290
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,536
Traffic cams might throw something up.

291
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:48,176
OK.

292
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:51,216
Let's meet at the end of
the day for a quick recap

293
00:32:51,217 --> 00:32:53,137
before we brief the rest of the team.

294
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,936
So, what you want to do about Mark?

295
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:04,456
Do want to charge him for
taking a swing at you?

296
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:06,056
Absolutely, yeah.

297
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:10,136
Let's make life as unpleasant
as we possibly can for Mr Lewis.

298
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,616
What?

299
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:12,977
Nothing.

300
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:17,136
Just the look on his face when you
threw him up against the wall.

301
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:19,856
Serves him right taking
on a woman half his size.

302
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:21,176
I mean, you know, obviously,

303
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:24,336
I was primed and ready to pounce
if things got out of hand.

304
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,857
Yeah, course you were.

305
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:30,416
And at least one good thing
came out of all of this.

306
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,337
- Yeah? What's that?
- I don't have to buy that house now.

307
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,896
Meg? Megan?

308
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:02,896
You OK? God, you look stoned.

309
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,536
- Yeah, fine.
- Want to get some coffee?

310
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:06,577
OK.

311
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:12,416
- Did you have another late one?
- Nah, couldn't face it.

312
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,136
My liver was begging for a night off!

313
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:16,497
So what did you do?

314
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:21,776
Went to the launderette,
watched some telly, did some shopping.

315
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,576
Thrilling stuff.

316
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:28,176
How about you? Did you do anything wild?

317
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:30,136
Anything shameful?

318
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:33,496
Went to the library, worked on my essay.

319
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:37,016
Do you speak to anyone else,
besides me and the librarian?

320
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:40,496
- Sometimes.
- Yeah? Like who?

321
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:41,737
Hiya.

322
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,056
I spoke to my mother last night.

323
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:50,776
- How did that go?
- Disaster.

324
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:52,976
Complaints, criticism.

325
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:54,936
I've stopped calling mine.

326
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,496
Think she's on the change or something.

327
00:38:57,497 --> 00:39:00,297
Or she's just middle-aged and mental.

328
00:39:01,377 --> 00:39:03,417
Who knows? Who cares?

329
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,737
Mine's the same.

330
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:10,336
I think that's the reason
why my dad left...

331
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,497
To get away from her constant criticism.

332
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,177
So, what's this essay about?

333
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:26,056
Nature versus nurture,
like, which is stronger?

334
00:39:26,057 --> 00:39:29,856
- And?
- Well, we're as much as product

335
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:32,696
of our genetics as the
environment we're born into.

336
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:37,257
It's like the debate about innate
ideas versus animal instinct.

337
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:41,216
Yeah! Yeah...

338
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:44,897
So, what about you?
What have you got on today?

339
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:48,616
Not a lot.

340
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:49,976
OK.

341
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:51,536
Do you want to do something later?

342
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:52,656
Sure.

343
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,857
Come over if you like,
I'll make us some food.

344
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:58,976
OK. Cool.

345
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:04,017
I'll bring the booze, we can get
wrecked and bitch about our mothers.

346
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:13,617
Sorry, that's all they had left.

347
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:20,617
A witness statement from last night.

348
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:32,096
A local man who came to
Lowri Driscoll's aid

349
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,257
described her assailant,
said he was tall... six foot plus.

350
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,496
Wearing combat trousers,
baseball cap, dark jacket.

351
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:44,736
I also spoke to the estate
agent where Marc Lewis works,

352
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:47,176
and apparently he left the office at three

353
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:50,016
to show a couple around a
house in Abergwyngregyn.

354
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,936
He was back at the office by five.

355
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:55,616
Lowri told us her last home visit
was at four and she left about 4:20,

356
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:58,257
and that's when she was confronted by Marc.

357
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:02,856
So, if Marc was back in the office by five,

358
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:06,376
he couldn't have known where
Lowri went after he left her.

359
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,297
Which leaves us with our mystery
man in the pick-up truck.

360
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:20,817
Are we sure about this?

361
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,056
About the connection between Mali Pryce

362
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:27,777
and the attack on Lowri Driscoll?

363
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:30,937
Honestly?

364
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:34,016
Don't know.

365
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:36,337
I hope not. I hope we're wrong.

366
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:40,736
But, worst-case scenario,

367
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:45,337
if that was our man who attacked
Lowri last night, and he failed...

368
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,777
it's only a matter of
time until he tries it again.

369
00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:25,897
Dylan Harris?

370
00:42:40,497 --> 00:42:42,737
Take a seat on the bed, Mr Harris.

371
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,257
Right, let's have a look at the hand.

372
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,817
I'm sorry if this hurts.

373
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,136
Now, I'm just going to squeeze
the tips of the fingers.

374
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:04,737
Let me know if this hurts.

375
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,617
Can you feel that?

376
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,136
You've got a nasty cut there.

377
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,497
How did it happen?

378
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:24,056
An accident. At work.

379
00:43:24,057 --> 00:43:25,897
And where's that?

380
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:31,257
Over at Carneddi, at the quarry.

381
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,857
And what happened?

382
00:43:38,097 --> 00:43:40,416
I wasn't thinking.

383
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,896
That's all.

384
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:44,737
Well, maybe next time you'll pay
a bit more care and attention.

385
00:43:46,937 --> 00:43:49,256
Well, I don't think you've broken anything.

386
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:51,896
There's no lasting damage.

387
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:54,217
But you won't be back at
the quarry for a while.

388
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:57,537
Right, let's get you stitched up.

389
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:14,897
2:30, Modern Europe. Tedious.
No idea why I chose history!

390
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:19,456
- What time should I come tonight?
- I don't know, about seven?

391
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,857
OK.

392
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:25,297
- No, no, no! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- Fucking dickheads!

393
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,976
It's broken! Fuck! What am I going to do?!

394
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:36,136
- I haven't backed anything up.
- It'll be OK.

395
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:38,496
No, no, you don't understand, it's ruined!

396
00:44:38,497 --> 00:44:40,016
- It's all gone!
- Meg, Jesus, please.

397
00:44:40,017 --> 00:44:43,817
Come on. Please. Come on. It'll be OK.

398
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,537
- It'll be OK.
- Don't touch me!

399
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:52,977
Jesus, Meg.

400
00:44:55,617 --> 00:44:57,416
Megan!

401
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,817
Megan! Where are you going?

402
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:30,096
Lowri arrived here just after four,
her last stop of the day.

403
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:34,176
She stayed for 20 minutes,
returned to the car,

404
00:45:34,177 --> 00:45:35,697
where she was confronted by her ex.

405
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:38,696
They argue,

406
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:42,137
Marc leaves, gets in his
car, he drives off.

407
00:45:43,497 --> 00:45:46,377
And he sees a man.
Parked in a red pick-up truck.

408
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:48,737
Watching them.

409
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,416
See, that makes me think
he was following her

410
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,737
before she even got here.

411
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:59,256
- Let's speak to Lowri's client... Mr...?
- Davis.

412
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,817
Davis. He might
have seen something.

413
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:52,817
Ta-ra.

414
00:48:54,337 --> 00:48:58,137
Lowri Driscoll stopped here at
around 2:45 yesterday afternoon.

415
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,297
So, what do you reckon?

416
00:49:01,497 --> 00:49:03,537
- Feeling lucky?
- Don't know.

417
00:49:04,777 --> 00:49:06,777
If the cameras are as
bad as their coffee...

418
00:49:16,137 --> 00:49:18,657
We wanted to take a look at your CCTV.

419
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:35,097
OK. Here's Lowri's car.

420
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:17,857
All right, stop a sec.

421
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:20,976
Rewind.

422
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,776
There, go from there.

423
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:24,616
OK, so there's Lowri.

424
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:27,537
Fills up her car,
she goes to pay, now watch.

425
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:34,097
There. She says something to him.

426
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:39,336
Thanks him?

427
00:51:39,337 --> 00:51:41,097
Yeah, but look at his reaction.

428
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:16,177
He's not leaving, he's not going.

429
00:52:18,057 --> 00:52:19,457
He's waiting for her.

430
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,297
He's following her.

431
00:52:44,217 --> 00:52:47,896
Hi, this is DI John, I need a PNC
check on a vehicle registration,

432
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:49,977
please. Mike, Lima, five, one...

433
00:52:51,537 --> 00:52:53,377
Uniform, Golf, X-ray.

434
00:53:05,337 --> 00:53:06,537
When was this?

435
00:53:51,577 --> 00:53:54,576
The truck's registered to a William Parry.

436
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:57,937
- OK.
- William Parry died in 1998.

437
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:33,097
Who the hell are you?

438
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:46,776
- Where am I?
- You've been in an accident.

439
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:50,377
You shouldn't move. I said I'll
take care of you, I promise.

440
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:02,416
We were hoping you'd have
time for a few questions.

441
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,536
Is now a good time, Mr Harris?

442
00:56:04,537 --> 00:56:06,056
Yeah. Sure.

443
00:56:06,057 --> 00:56:07,737
How can I help?
