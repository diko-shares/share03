1
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.150
Everybody, heads up!
Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.606
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.529
Stand back!

4
00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.531
Bring it forward, come on!

5
00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:45.875
Slow it down!

6
00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.726
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

7
00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:02.806
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.568
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:09.570
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:12.902
And push.

11
00:02:19.363 --> 00:02:21.991
Locked. Loading team,
step away.

12
00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.200
Move it.

13
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:32.634
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.313
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.453
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.455
Work her back!

17
00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:18.464
Shoot her!

18
00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.255
I heard that Hammond's
not even here.

19
00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.760
He sends his apologies.

20
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.764
There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker

21
00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:06.437
and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

22
00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.641
He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.

23
00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:12.772
I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.

24
00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.025
- The insurance company...
- You okay?

25
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:22.537
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

26
00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:24.909
That makes the investors
very anxious.

27
00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:28.584
I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.

28
00:04:29.994 --> 00:04:32.668
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

29
00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.464
I need to or they'll
pull the funding.

30
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.417
That'll slow him down even more.

31
00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.349
Watch your head.

32
00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:47.224
If two experts sign off
on the island,

33
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:48.896
the insurance guys
will back off.

34
00:04:49.263 --> 00:04:52.233
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

35
00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:53.981
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

36
00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.312
You'll never get him
out of Montana.

37
00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.730
Why not?

38
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.488
Why not?

39
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.821
Because Grant's like me.

40
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.245
He's a digger.

41
00:05:53.827 --> 00:05:56.706
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

42
00:05:57.998 --> 00:05:59.591
I hate computers.

43
00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.552
The feeling's mutual.

44
00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:17.734
Take a look.

45
00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:21.863
Did it work?

46
00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.441
How long does this take?

47
00:06:23.524 --> 00:06:25.026
Should bring
an immediate return.

48
00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:26.577
You shoot the radar
into the ground,

49
00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.996
and the bone bounces
the image back.

50
00:06:29.863 --> 00:06:31.365
Bounces it back...

51
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.498
This new program is incredible.

52
00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:37.913
A few more years' development,

53
00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.544
and we won't even
have to dig anymore.

54
00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:41.341
Where's the fun in that?

55
00:06:41.917 --> 00:06:45.421
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.

56
00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:49.642
Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.

57
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.222
Velociraptor?

58
00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:52.932
Yes. Good shape, too.

59
00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:56.433
It's five, six feet high.
I'm guessing nine feet long.

60
00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:57.858
- Look...
- What'd you do?

61
00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:59.276
He touched it.

62
00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.445
Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.

63
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.318
Hell, they've got it in for me.

64
00:07:04.273 --> 00:07:06.901
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.

65
00:07:06.984 --> 00:07:09.658
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

66
00:07:11.488 --> 00:07:12.831
No, seriously.

67
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.797
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.

68
00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:23.376
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

69
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:27.589
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.

70
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:30.970
And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."

71
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.723
That doesn't look very scary.

72
00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:37.640
More like a 6-foot turkey.

73
00:07:40.142 --> 00:07:41.485
A turkey?

74
00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:47.616
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.

75
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.912
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

76
00:07:51.987 --> 00:07:55.161
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

77
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.666
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,

78
00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.419
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

79
00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.626
But no, not Velociraptor.

80
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.130
You stare at him and he
just stares right back.

81
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.223
And that's when
the attack comes.

82
00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:13.847
Not from the front,
but from the side.

83
00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:18.727
From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.

84
00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:22.272
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

85
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:25.230
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

86
00:08:25.312 --> 00:08:27.610
and he is out in force today.

87
00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:31.114
And he slashes at you with this,

88
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.865
a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.

89
00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:39.873
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.

90
00:08:40.202 --> 00:08:42.045
He slashes at you

91
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.623
here or here...

92
00:08:44.998 --> 00:08:46.170
Alan.

93
00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:50.509
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

94
00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:56.761
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

95
00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:01.770
So, you know, try to
show a little respect.

96
00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:03.438
Okay.

97
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.698
Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

98
00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:15.871
you could've pulled
a gun on him.

99
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:18.449
Yeah, I know. Kids.

100
00:09:19.283 --> 00:09:21.285
You want to have one of those?

101
00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:23.079
I don't want that kid,

102
00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:26.336
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.

103
00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:29.092
I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?

104
00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:33.594
They're noisy, they're
messy, they're expensive.

105
00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:35.174
Cheap, cheap.

106
00:09:35.257 --> 00:09:36.679
They smell.

107
00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:38.432
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

108
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.808
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

109
00:09:48.395 --> 00:09:50.443
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

110
00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:51.774
Tell them to shut down!

111
00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.109
Cut the machine!

112
00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:55.786
Cover it all up.
Pull it over.

113
00:09:57.613 --> 00:10:01.208
Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!

114
00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.039
What?

115
00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:20.853
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

116
00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:22.888
We were saving that.

117
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.059
For today, I guarantee it.

118
00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:29.482
Who in God's name
do you think you are?

119
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:30.728
John Hammond.

120
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:34.108
And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

121
00:10:35.317 --> 00:10:40.164
So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.

122
00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:42.081
Who's the jerk?

123
00:10:42.157 --> 00:10:44.410
This is our paleobotanist, Dr...

124
00:10:44.493 --> 00:10:45.585
Sattler.

125
00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:47.963
Ellie, this
is Mr. Hammond.

126
00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:51.421
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr.
Sattler, but...

127
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.502
- Did I say "jerk"?
- ...we're in a hurry.

128
00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:57.010
Will you have a drink? We won't
let it get warm. Sit down.

129
00:10:57.673 --> 00:11:00.847
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

130
00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.473
There's samples all over here.

131
00:11:02.553 --> 00:11:04.180
I know my way
around the kitchen.

132
00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:06.436
Now, I'll get right
to the point.

133
00:11:08.016 --> 00:11:10.360
I like you.
Both of you.

134
00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:14.023
I can tell instantly about people.
It's a gift.

135
00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.280
I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.

136
00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:24.371
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years,

137
00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.952
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

138
00:11:27.035 --> 00:11:29.413
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

139
00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:32.966
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

140
00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:37.012
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

141
00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:38.798
And what are those?

142
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:40.679
Small versions of adults, honey.

143
00:11:40.757 --> 00:11:42.680
And not just kids, everyone.

144
00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:46.104
We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.

145
00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:48.398
I don't care for
lawyers, do you?

146
00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:52.110
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

147
00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:57.283
I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.

148
00:11:57.524 --> 00:12:00.368
Says that they insist
on outside opinions.

149
00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:02.071
What kind of opinions?

150
00:12:02.195 --> 00:12:05.199
Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.

151
00:12:05.282 --> 00:12:09.378
Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.

152
00:12:09.703 --> 00:12:11.922
And if I could just persuade you

153
00:12:12.372 --> 00:12:15.546
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,

154
00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:21.224
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

155
00:12:21.632 --> 00:12:23.600
Why would they care
what we think?

156
00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:25.222
What kind of park is this?

157
00:12:27.804 --> 00:12:29.522
It's right up your alley.

158
00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:35.612
Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?

159
00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:38.861
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

160
00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.861
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

161
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.164
I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.

162
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.492
We just dug up a new skeleton...

163
00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:52.546
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

164
00:12:53.163 --> 00:12:55.632
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...

165
00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:57.675
...for a further
three years.

166
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.387
Where's the plane?

167
00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:07.302
- Okay.
- Three years.

168
00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.683
Cheers.

169
00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:52.226
Dodgson!

170
00:14:00.397 --> 00:14:02.195
You shouldn't use my name.

171
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:06.035
Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.

172
00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:09.865
See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.

173
00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.451
What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?

174
00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:15.120
- Well?
- $750,000.

175
00:14:15.704 --> 00:14:18.127
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

176
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:21.297
That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.

177
00:14:21.376 --> 00:14:22.502
I'll get them all.

178
00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:26.511
Remember, viable embryos. They're
no use to us if they don't survive.

179
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.809
How am I supposed
to transport them?

180
00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:33.351
The bottom screws open.

181
00:14:35.724 --> 00:14:37.647
That's great.
Oh, my God.

182
00:14:37.726 --> 00:14:40.070
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

183
00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.738
You guys.
That's great.

184
00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:43.565
Customs can even check it
if they want to.

185
00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:45.150
- Let me see.
- Go on.

186
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.869
There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.

187
00:14:47.944 --> 00:14:49.116
No menthol?

188
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.995
The embryos have to be back
here in San José by then.

189
00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:54.083
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

190
00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:57.288
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

191
00:14:58.163 --> 00:14:59.915
How are you planning
to beat security?

192
00:14:59.998 --> 00:15:01.591
I've got
an 18-minute window.

193
00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:06.172
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

194
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.302
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

195
00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:16.848
That was Hammond's mistake.

196
00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:33.408
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

197
00:15:36.034 --> 00:15:37.957
- Well...
- We try to.

198
00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:46.924
You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.

199
00:15:47.003 --> 00:15:49.802
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

200
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:51.383
especially for a mathematician.

201
00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:53.343
Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.

202
00:15:53.426 --> 00:15:55.224
John doesn't subscribe to chaos,

203
00:15:55.303 --> 00:15:57.806
particularly what it says
about his science project.

204
00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:01.610
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

205
00:16:01.685 --> 00:16:04.564
Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?

206
00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:07.900
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...

207
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.242
Don't.

208
00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:12.408
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

209
00:16:12.696 --> 00:16:13.697
No.

210
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.077
No? Non-linear equations?

211
00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:17.910
Strange attractors?

212
00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:24.917
I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.

213
00:16:28.753 --> 00:16:32.053
I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.

214
00:16:36.511 --> 00:16:37.603
There it is.

215
00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.676
Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.

216
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:09.594
Hold on, this will be thrilling.

217
00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:40.708
But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...

218
00:17:40.825 --> 00:17:42.873
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

219
00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.793
Great.

220
00:19:04.034 --> 00:19:06.662
The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?

221
00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:09.965
And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.

222
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:13.255
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

223
00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.429
Let's get this straight. This
is not a weekend excursion.

224
00:19:16.504 --> 00:19:19.599
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

225
00:19:19.716 --> 00:19:22.845
Your investors, whom I
represent, are deeply concerned.

226
00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:25.806
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

227
00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:27.982
I'll shut you down, John.

228
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.821
In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.

229
00:19:42.113 --> 00:19:44.411
All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!

230
00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.291
This shouldn't be here.

231
00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:10.437
Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct

232
00:20:10.517 --> 00:20:12.861
since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

233
00:20:13.853 --> 00:20:15.196
What?

234
00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.140
Look at that.

235
00:20:49.472 --> 00:20:51.520
It's a dinosaur.

236
00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:59.199
You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.

237
00:21:00.608 --> 00:21:04.203
We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

238
00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:06.623
They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.

239
00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:08.200
This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.

240
00:21:08.283 --> 00:21:10.285
This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?

241
00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:11.790
The <i>Brachiosaurus?</i> 30.

242
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.871
Thirty feet.

243
00:21:29.596 --> 00:21:32.224
We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.

244
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.529
How fast are they?

245
00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:41.866
Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

246
00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.112
T-Rex?

247
00:21:46.237 --> 00:21:48.205
You said you've
got a T-Rex?

248
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.412
Say again.

249
00:21:51.534 --> 00:21:52.911
We have a T-Rex.

250
00:21:54.871 --> 00:21:57.044
Put your head
between your knees.

251
00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:58.632
Dr. Grant,

252
00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:01.051
my dear Dr. Sattler,

253
00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:04.639
welcome to Jurassic Park.

254
00:22:28.238 --> 00:22:30.206
They're moving in herds.

255
00:22:32.283 --> 00:22:34.160
They do move in herds.

256
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.553
How did you do this?

257
00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:47.682
I'll show you.

258
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:13.783
Good day.

259
00:23:14.492 --> 00:23:18.838
The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

260
00:23:18.913 --> 00:23:21.007
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

261
00:23:21.124 --> 00:23:24.503
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

262
00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:28.932
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding

263
00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:32.102
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

264
00:23:32.885 --> 00:23:34.683
So, what are you thinking?

265
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.273
That we're out of a job.

266
00:23:37.348 --> 00:23:39.021
Don't you mean "extinct"?

267
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:50.946
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

268
00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:54.912
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

269
00:23:59.537 --> 00:24:00.754
<i>Hello.</i>

270
00:24:01.414 --> 00:24:02.415
Say hello.

271
00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:04.216
Hello.

272
00:24:05.335 --> 00:24:06.507
<i>Hello, John.</i>

273
00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:09.009
Yes, I've got lines.

274
00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:12.558
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

275
00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:17.556
Well, let me show you. First,
I'll need a drop of blood.

276
00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:19.390
Your blood.

277
00:24:19.474 --> 00:24:20.726
<i>Right.</i>

278
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.562
<i>That hurt.</i>

279
00:24:23.978 --> 00:24:26.731
Relax, John. It's all
part of the miracle of cloning.

280
00:24:27.273 --> 00:24:29.241
<i>Hello, John.</i>

281
00:24:31.235 --> 00:24:32.612
Cloned from what?

282
00:24:32.695 --> 00:24:35.323
Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.

283
00:24:35.406 --> 00:24:37.079
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

284
00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:39.452
Paleo-DNA,
from what source?

285
00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:43.248
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

286
00:24:48.252 --> 00:24:49.595
<i>What? What?</i>

287
00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:53.391
<i>Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?</i>

288
00:24:53.466 --> 00:24:54.718
<i>From your blood.</i>

289
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:59.352
<i>Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,</i>

290
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.727
<i>the building blocks of life.</i>

291
00:25:02.475 --> 00:25:07.356
<i>A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.</i>

292
00:25:07.438 --> 00:25:12.786
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,</i>

293
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.832
<i>left their blueprints behind for us to
find. We just had to know where to look.</i>

294
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.871
<i>A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.</i>

295
00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:26.458
<i>And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.</i>

296
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:31.342
<i>Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,</i>

297
00:25:31.421 --> 00:25:36.302
<i>mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

298
00:25:36.384 --> 00:25:41.185
<i>After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,</i>

299
00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:46.186
<i>just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

300
00:25:46.894 --> 00:25:50.489
<i>This fossilized tree sap,
which we call amber,</i>

301
00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:55.241
<i>waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside</i>

302
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.243
<i>until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.</i>

303
00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:01.285
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,</i>

304
00:26:01.367 --> 00:26:03.461
<i>they extract the preserved blood</i>

305
00:26:03.536 --> 00:26:07.882
<i>from the mosquito, dino DNA!</i>

306
00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:13.217
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

307
00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:17.934
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,</i>

308
00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:22.139
<i>it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.</i>

309
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:27.443
<i>It's that long. Since it's
so old, it's full of holes.</i>

310
00:26:27.518 --> 00:26:30.192
<i>Now that's where our
geneticists take over.</i>

311
00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.405
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers</i>

312
00:26:34.484 --> 00:26:36.657
<i>break down the strand
in minutes.</i>

313
00:26:36.736 --> 00:26:38.784
<i>And virtual-reality displays</i>

314
00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:42.037
<i>show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

315
00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:45.120
<i>We used the complete
DNA of a frog</i>

316
00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:49.128
<i>to fill in the holes
and complete the code.</i>

317
00:26:49.707 --> 00:26:54.508
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

318
00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:58.971
This score is only temporary.

319
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.690
It all has very dramatic
music, of course.

320
00:27:01.719 --> 00:27:03.972
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

321
00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.057
And then, the tour moves on.

322
00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:20.409
<i>Well, look here. Those
hard-working cowpokes you see behind</i> us...

323
00:27:20.488 --> 00:27:22.911
This is overwhelming, John.

324
00:27:23.157 --> 00:27:27.333
Are these characters
autoerotica?

325
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:30.130
No, we have no
animatronics here.

326
00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:33.255
Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.

327
00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:36.554
<i>...in unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.</i>

328
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.600
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

329
00:27:40.675 --> 00:27:42.177
Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?

330
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.386
Shortly.

331
00:27:44.512 --> 00:27:48.437
<i>Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...</i>

332
00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:49.733
Can't you stop these things?

333
00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:51.903
I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.

334
00:27:51.978 --> 00:27:53.946
One, two, three.

335
00:27:55.606 --> 00:27:57.700
- You can't do that.
- What?

336
00:27:57.775 --> 00:27:59.277
Can they do that?

337
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:03.949
<i>A reminder: the boat for the mainland</i>

338
00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:06.159
<i>will be leaving at 1900.</i>

339
00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:11.211
<i>All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.</i>

340
00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:13.716
Good day, Henry.

341
00:28:13.791 --> 00:28:15.134
Good day, sir.

342
00:28:29.181 --> 00:28:30.774
It's turning the eggs.

343
00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:38.483
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

344
00:28:38.566 --> 00:28:41.115
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

345
00:28:41.193 --> 00:28:45.164
I insist on being here
when they're born.

346
00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:48.243
Come on.

347
00:28:49.827 --> 00:28:51.500
Come on, little one.

348
00:28:57.835 --> 00:28:59.212
Come on, then.

349
00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:04.391
Very good. Push.

350
00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:08.517
- Very good.
- God.

351
00:29:08.596 --> 00:29:11.019
Push. Come on.

352
00:29:11.599 --> 00:29:14.523
Come on. Come on, then.

353
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.654
There you are.

354
00:29:22.693 --> 00:29:26.072
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

355
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:29.034
That's it.
Helps them to trust me.

356
00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:34.873
I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.

357
00:29:35.748 --> 00:29:38.968
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?

358
00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:41.379
Actually they can't
breed in the wild.

359
00:29:41.462 --> 00:29:44.306
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

360
00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:47.386
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

361
00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:50.809
How do you know
they can't breed'?

362
00:29:52.014 --> 00:29:55.393
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

363
00:29:55.476 --> 00:29:57.854
We've engineered them that way.

364
00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.567
There you are.

365
00:30:01.857 --> 00:30:04.485
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

366
00:30:05.027 --> 00:30:08.327
Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.

367
00:30:08.406 --> 00:30:09.532
Wu?

368
00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:10.912
Ninety-one.

369
00:30:10.992 --> 00:30:13.120
Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?

370
00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:14.294
Yes.

371
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.753
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

372
00:30:21.836 --> 00:30:26.012
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

373
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.720
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

374
00:30:29.802 --> 00:30:32.396
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

375
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:35.645
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

376
00:30:35.725 --> 00:30:37.147
to make them male.

377
00:30:37.226 --> 00:30:38.273
We simply deny them that.

378
00:30:38.769 --> 00:30:40.191
Deny them that?

379
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:44.242
John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.

380
00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:46.489
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

381
00:30:46.569 --> 00:30:48.947
it's that life will
not be contained.

382
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.283
Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories

383
00:30:51.407 --> 00:30:54.581
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

384
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.789
but there it is.

385
00:30:59.498 --> 00:31:00.966
There it is.

386
00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:06.423
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

387
00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:10.931
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

388
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.977
What species is this?

389
00:31:22.063 --> 00:31:23.690
It's a Velociraptor.

390
00:31:27.902 --> 00:31:29.404
You bred Raptors?

391
00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:48.299
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

392
00:31:48.422 --> 00:31:51.471
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?

393
00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:58.353
Feeding them.

394
00:32:03.562 --> 00:32:08.819
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass, I believe.

395
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.953
Shall we?

396
00:32:50.693 --> 00:32:52.991
They should all be destroyed.

397
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.074
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.

398
00:32:56.157 --> 00:32:59.161
Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.

399
00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.371
What's their growth rate?

400
00:33:01.453 --> 00:33:04.673
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

401
00:33:04.748 --> 00:33:07.428
I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...

402
00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:09.754
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

403
00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:13.133
Fifty, sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.

404
00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.537
And they're astonishing jumpers.

405
00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:17.766
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

406
00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.683
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...

407
00:33:21.765 --> 00:33:23.483
They show extreme intelligence.

408
00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:26.028
Even problem-solving
intelligence.

409
00:33:26.103 --> 00:33:28.356
Especially the big one.

410
00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.191
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in,

411
00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:33.619
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.

412
00:33:33.694 --> 00:33:39.451
That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.

413
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:43.250
That's why we have to
feed them like this.

414
00:33:43.329 --> 00:33:45.689
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

415
00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:47.879
The fences are electrified,
right?

416
00:33:47.958 --> 00:33:51.337
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

417
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.095
They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.

418
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.927
They remember.

419
00:34:09.146 --> 00:34:11.990
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

420
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:14.364
<i>More
adventurous guests, of course,</i>

421
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:16.070
<i>can opt for our
jungle river cruise</i>

422
00:34:16.153 --> 00:34:18.531
<i>or for a close-up look
at our majestic...</i>

423
00:34:18.614 --> 00:34:21.914
None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open

424
00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:26.338
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

425
00:34:26.413 --> 00:34:27.693
six or twelve months after that.

426
00:34:27.748 --> 00:34:30.046
Absolutely spectacular designs.

427
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:31.125
Spared no expense.

428
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.428
And we can charge
anything we want.

429
00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:36.223
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

430
00:34:36.298 --> 00:34:38.016
And there's the merchandise...

431
00:34:38.092 --> 00:34:39.184
Donald.

432
00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:42.851
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

433
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:46.059
Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.

434
00:34:46.141 --> 00:34:50.692
Sure. They will. We'll have
a coupon day or something.

435
00:34:54.858 --> 00:35:00.865
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

436
00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:04.957
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

437
00:35:05.035 --> 00:35:06.161
I know.
They're a lot worse.

438
00:35:06.245 --> 00:35:09.374
Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...

439
00:35:10.457 --> 00:35:14.382
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

440
00:35:15.212 --> 00:35:20.343
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

441
00:35:20.426 --> 00:35:22.826
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

442
00:35:22.845 --> 00:35:25.815
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

443
00:35:25.889 --> 00:35:27.106
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

444
00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:29.940
If I may.

445
00:35:30.019 --> 00:35:33.319
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

446
00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:36.401
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

447
00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:41.156
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

448
00:35:41.238 --> 00:35:42.706
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

449
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.910
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

450
00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.793
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

451
00:35:49.872 --> 00:35:51.072
something as fast as you could.

452
00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:55.302
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

453
00:35:55.377 --> 00:35:58.221
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

454
00:35:58.297 --> 00:35:59.344
You're going to sell it.

455
00:36:00.924 --> 00:36:03.347
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

456
00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:06.681
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

457
00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:09.893
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

458
00:36:09.975 --> 00:36:11.852
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

459
00:36:12.311 --> 00:36:15.941
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

460
00:36:16.982 --> 00:36:20.202
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

461
00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:21.904
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

462
00:36:21.987 --> 00:36:24.706
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

463
00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:28.002
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

464
00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:33.459
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

465
00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:39.138
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

466
00:36:39.254 --> 00:36:44.135
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

467
00:36:44.218 --> 00:36:45.640
What's so great about discovery?

468
00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:47.892
It's a violent, penetrative act,

469
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:51.316
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

470
00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:55.021
I call the rape of
the natural world.

471
00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.485
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

472
00:37:00.567 --> 00:37:03.696
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

473
00:37:03.779 --> 00:37:06.749
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

474
00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.344
You picked them
because they look good.

475
00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:11.705
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

476
00:37:11.787 --> 00:37:14.961
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

477
00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:20.679
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

478
00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:23.011
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

479
00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:29.230
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

480
00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:34.940
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

481
00:37:35.018 --> 00:37:38.989
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution

482
00:37:39.064 --> 00:37:42.409
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

483
00:37:42.484 --> 00:37:46.864
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

484
00:37:48.907 --> 00:37:50.750
I don't believe it.

485
00:37:50.826 --> 00:37:53.500
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

486
00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:56.628
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

487
00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.127
Thank you.

488
00:38:06.049 --> 00:38:07.221
They're here.

489
00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:11.017
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

490
00:38:11.096 --> 00:38:13.724
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

491
00:38:13.807 --> 00:38:16.401
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

492
00:38:19.646 --> 00:38:21.193
Wait! Careful with me.

493
00:38:21.273 --> 00:38:22.320
We missed you.

494
00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:23.571
Me, too.

495
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.119
We loved the presents.
They were great.

496
00:38:26.195 --> 00:38:27.355
Did you enjoy the helicopter?

497
00:38:27.404 --> 00:38:30.248
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

498
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:36.584
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

499
00:38:38.081 --> 00:38:41.426
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though'?

500
00:38:41.502 --> 00:38:43.675
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

501
00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:44.755
No drivers?

502
00:38:44.838 --> 00:38:46.840
No. No drivers.
They're electric.

503
00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:49.677
They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.

504
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.604
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

505
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.682
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

506
00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:58.815
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

507
00:38:58.894 --> 00:39:01.989
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

508
00:39:02.064 --> 00:39:03.657
Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.

509
00:39:03.732 --> 00:39:06.281
I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.

510
00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.628
I read your book.

511
00:39:21.208 --> 00:39:22.300
That's great.

512
00:39:23.418 --> 00:39:27.048
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

513
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.469
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

514
00:39:36.473 --> 00:39:39.317
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

515
00:39:40.143 --> 00:39:43.067
I heard that there
was this meteor,

516
00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:47.401
hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

517
00:39:47.484 --> 00:39:49.077
Listen...

518
00:39:49.152 --> 00:39:50.199
Tim.

519
00:39:51.196 --> 00:39:53.870
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

520
00:39:55.576 --> 00:39:57.624
Whichever one you are.

521
00:39:59.955 --> 00:40:05.177
Then I heard about this thing in <i>Omni</i>
about this meteor making all this heat.

522
00:40:05.252 --> 00:40:08.005
It made diamond dust and
that changed the weather.

523
00:40:08.088 --> 00:40:09.556
They died because
of the weather.

524
00:40:09.631 --> 00:40:13.977
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

525
00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:19.308
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

526
00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.731
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

527
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.657
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.</i>

528
00:40:27.566 --> 00:40:30.786
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm

529
00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:33.614
about 75 miles west of us.

530
00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.415
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

531
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.245
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll
swing south like the last one.

532
00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:45.217
Ray, start the tour program.

533
00:40:55.302 --> 00:40:57.396
Hold onto your butts.

534
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.324
<i>And why did they put the fiberglass thing?</i>

535
00:41:10.776 --> 00:41:11.868
<i>I know.</i>

536
00:41:20.243 --> 00:41:22.416
You want to
join the future, right?

537
00:41:22.621 --> 00:41:24.999
God help us when
the hands of engineers...

538
00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.334
<i>During your tour,</i>

539
00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:28.043
<i>the appropriate
information will be</i>

540
00:41:28.126 --> 00:41:30.254
<i>automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

541
00:41:30.379 --> 00:41:31.380
Look!

542
00:41:31.463 --> 00:41:34.387
<i>Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

543
00:41:34.466 --> 00:41:35.638
Are we gonna hit that?

544
00:41:35.717 --> 00:41:38.436
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

545
00:41:42.015 --> 00:41:44.438
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

546
00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:01.039
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

547
00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.370
We spared no expense.

548
00:42:02.452 --> 00:42:03.669
<i>If you look to the right,</i>

549
00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:09.548
<i>you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

550
00:42:09.626 --> 00:42:10.878
Dilophosaurus!

551
00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:11.962
Shit!

552
00:42:12.045 --> 00:42:13.968
<i>One of the earliest carnivores,</i>

553
00:42:14.047 --> 00:42:17.267
<i>we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous</i>

554
00:42:17.342 --> 00:42:22.690
<i>spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,</i>

555
00:42:22.764 --> 00:42:25.859
<i>allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

556
00:42:26.268 --> 00:42:30.239
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition</i>

557
00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:32.156
<i>to Jurassic Park.</i>

558
00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.658
Alan?

559
00:42:41.742 --> 00:42:42.914
Where?

560
00:42:46.788 --> 00:42:47.835
Damn.

561
00:42:52.627 --> 00:42:54.925
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

562
00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:57.508
Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.

563
00:42:57.632 --> 00:43:00.681
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

564
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:03.389
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo

565
00:43:03.472 --> 00:43:06.476
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

566
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:12.323
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?

567
00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:16.451
I am totally unappreciated
in my time.

568
00:43:16.526 --> 00:43:20.372
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

569
00:43:20.447 --> 00:43:24.497
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

570
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:27.249
You know anybody who can
network eight machines

571
00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:31.129
and de-bug two million lines of code on
my salary? If so, I want to see them.

572
00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:35.805
Sorry about your financial problems, I
really am. But they are your problems.

573
00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:38.302
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

574
00:43:38.381 --> 00:43:42.887
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

575
00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:44.221
I really will not.

576
00:43:44.304 --> 00:43:45.784
There's been hardly
any debate at all.

577
00:43:46.306 --> 00:43:49.185
I don't blame people
for their mistakes.

578
00:43:49.976 --> 00:43:51.899
But I do ask that
they pay for them.

579
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:53.487
Thanks, Dad.

580
00:43:54.731 --> 00:43:55.823
The headlights.

581
00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:59.028
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

582
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.158
It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.

583
00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:02.581
We'll lose part of the system.

584
00:44:02.656 --> 00:44:04.829
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

585
00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.455
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...

586
00:44:06.535 --> 00:44:08.537
Quiet, all of you!

587
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.424
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

588
00:45:03.258 --> 00:45:07.183
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

589
00:45:07.262 --> 00:45:12.063
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

590
00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:16.773
Dinosaurs eat man.

591
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:20.325
Woman inherits the earth.

592
00:45:28.074 --> 00:45:31.499
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.</i>

593
00:45:41.296 --> 00:45:43.094
What's going to happen
to the goat?

594
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.512
He's going to eat the goat?

595
00:45:49.596 --> 00:45:51.314
Excellent.

596
00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:55.269
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

597
00:45:55.852 --> 00:45:58.105
I happen to be a vegetarian.

598
00:46:06.446 --> 00:46:09.666
T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

599
00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:15.376
You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

600
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:42.237
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

601
00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.204
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

602
00:46:48.947 --> 00:46:50.949
I really hate that man.

603
00:46:55.996 --> 00:47:00.877
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.

604
00:47:00.959 --> 00:47:03.132
The essence of chaos.

605
00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:06.256
I'm still not clear on chaos.

606
00:47:07.924 --> 00:47:11.849
It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.

607
00:47:13.388 --> 00:47:15.686
The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.

608
00:47:15.765 --> 00:47:17.688
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking

609
00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:20.065
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

610
00:47:23.064 --> 00:47:24.862
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

611
00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:25.942
I did a fly-by.

612
00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:28.657
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

613
00:47:28.737 --> 00:47:30.364
We should be still.
The car's bouncing.

614
00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.074
That's okay.
It's just an example.

615
00:47:32.782 --> 00:47:35.535
Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

616
00:47:35.618 --> 00:47:37.712
A drop of water falls
on your hand.

617
00:47:37.787 --> 00:47:40.882
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

618
00:47:40.957 --> 00:47:42.425
Thumb, I'd say.

619
00:47:45.253 --> 00:47:47.096
Freeze your hand.
Don't move.

620
00:47:47.172 --> 00:47:50.142
I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.

621
00:47:50.258 --> 00:47:51.805
Which way, now?

622
00:47:51.885 --> 00:47:54.855
Let's say back the same way.

623
00:47:57.098 --> 00:47:59.567
It changed. Why?

624
00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:01.940
Because tiny variations,

625
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:04.899
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

626
00:48:04.981 --> 00:48:06.574
Alan, look at this.

627
00:48:06.649 --> 00:48:09.649
...the amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...

628
00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:11.329
"Imperfections in the skin"?

629
00:48:11.738 --> 00:48:12.990
...just microscopic,

630
00:48:13.114 --> 00:48:16.038
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.

631
00:48:16.117 --> 00:48:17.243
That's what?

632
00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.328
Unpredictability.

633
00:48:21.247 --> 00:48:24.547
There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.

634
00:48:24.626 --> 00:48:28.597
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

635
00:48:31.257 --> 00:48:33.680
And there's another example.

636
00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:39.521
See, here I am now by myself, talking
to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

637
00:48:40.934 --> 00:48:43.858
Stop the program.

638
00:48:45.855 --> 00:48:50.235
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

639
00:48:50.318 --> 00:48:52.946
<i>Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</i>

640
00:48:53.029 --> 00:48:55.282
<i>We're on.
Will notify for resume.</i>

641
00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.794
I'll switch it over to teleprompter.

642
00:48:59.869 --> 00:49:01.337
What about the circuit integrities?

643
00:49:01.412 --> 00:49:02.959
Screen says faulty sensor.

644
00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:06.960
I'll call security.

645
00:49:07.043 --> 00:49:09.387
We're at full go on that and it looks good.

646
00:49:09.712 --> 00:49:13.433
Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker

647
00:49:13.508 --> 00:49:15.306
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.

648
00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.728
Where are we going?

649
00:49:16.803 --> 00:49:18.521
He didn't say
they turned into birds.

650
00:49:18.596 --> 00:49:20.894
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

651
00:49:20.974 --> 00:49:23.853
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

652
00:49:23.935 --> 00:49:26.688
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

653
00:49:28.022 --> 00:49:29.490
You okay?

654
00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.944
Look at this.
Wait. Watch.

655
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:34.742
Come on. Watch this.

656
00:49:36.364 --> 00:49:37.866
Whoa.

657
00:49:40.118 --> 00:49:41.665
Everybody stay here.

658
00:49:56.926 --> 00:49:58.303
Wow.

659
00:49:59.929 --> 00:50:00.930
Okay?

660
00:50:01.014 --> 00:50:02.106
Of course.

661
00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:06.819
Don't be scared.
Come on, it's okay.

662
00:50:06.895 --> 00:50:08.818
Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.

663
00:50:08.897 --> 00:50:10.274
She's sick.

664
00:50:19.115 --> 00:50:20.583
Oh, my God.

665
00:50:36.049 --> 00:50:37.596
Hey, baby.

666
00:50:43.139 --> 00:50:45.642
She was always my favorite
when I was a kid

667
00:50:45.725 --> 00:50:49.446
and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

668
00:50:53.358 --> 00:50:55.031
It's okay.

669
00:50:57.946 --> 00:51:00.495
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

670
00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:04.836
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

671
00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:08.460
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

672
00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:10.416
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

673
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.672
Six weeks.

674
00:51:25.598 --> 00:51:27.191
- These are dilated.
- They are?

675
00:51:27.308 --> 00:51:29.060
Take a look.

676
00:51:29.143 --> 00:51:30.269
I'll be damned.

677
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.900
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

678
00:51:41.948 --> 00:51:44.076
Is this West Indian lilac?

679
00:51:44.659 --> 00:51:48.209
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

680
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:54.176
Are you sure?

681
00:51:54.252 --> 00:51:55.299
Pretty sure.

682
00:51:56.754 --> 00:51:59.098
There's only one way
to be positive.

683
00:51:59.882 --> 00:52:02.431
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

684
00:52:03.428 --> 00:52:06.557
Dino droppings?
Droppings?

685
00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:14.648
Yeah, I got that.

686
00:52:15.857 --> 00:52:19.157
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

687
00:52:19.235 --> 00:52:21.784
We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.

688
00:52:21.863 --> 00:52:23.661
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

689
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.787
Are you sure we have to?

690
00:52:24.866 --> 00:52:26.914
It's not worth
taking the chance.

691
00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:27.994
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

692
00:52:28.077 --> 00:52:30.671
Tell them when they get
back in the cars.

693
00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:35.378
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

694
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.804
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

695
00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.053
Damn!

696
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:50.813
That is one big pile of shit.

697
00:52:58.024 --> 00:53:00.948
You're right. There's no
trace of lilac berries.

698
00:53:01.027 --> 00:53:03.155
That's so odd, though.

699
00:53:03.237 --> 00:53:07.287
All right, she's suffering
from <i>Melia</i> toxicity

700
00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:10.999
every six weeks.

701
00:53:12.497 --> 00:53:15.341
Let's see, rats.

702
00:53:17.001 --> 00:53:20.130
She's tenacious.

703
00:53:21.047 --> 00:53:22.765
You have no idea.

704
00:53:24.717 --> 00:53:28.472
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

705
00:53:41.025 --> 00:53:44.950
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

706
00:53:47.365 --> 00:53:50.960
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

707
00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.334
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

708
00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:56.340
I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.

709
00:53:56.416 --> 00:53:59.135
Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.

710
00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:00.302
You sure?

711
00:54:00.378 --> 00:54:03.131
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

712
00:54:03.214 --> 00:54:04.636
Okay, then.

713
00:54:19.439 --> 00:54:23.990
<i>There's nothing I can do. The captain
says we got to go, we got to go.</i>

714
00:54:24.068 --> 00:54:25.615
You've got to give me the time.

715
00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:29.040
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18

716
00:54:29.115 --> 00:54:31.664
but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

717
00:54:31.742 --> 00:54:33.540
<i>No promises.</i>

718
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.429
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

719
00:54:45.756 --> 00:54:50.887
So much for our first tour. Two
no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

720
00:54:52.096 --> 00:54:53.848
It could've been worse.

721
00:54:54.932 --> 00:54:56.479
A lot worse.

722
00:54:56.559 --> 00:55:00.314
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

723
00:55:00.396 --> 00:55:02.569
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

724
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.740
I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.

725
00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.990
I finished debugging the phones.

726
00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:13.285
I was going to, so I did.

727
00:55:13.367 --> 00:55:16.496
So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe

728
00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:19.799
I should tell you the system
will be compiling

729
00:55:19.874 --> 00:55:22.343
for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,

730
00:55:22.418 --> 00:55:26.389
they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

731
00:55:48.277 --> 00:55:49.745
DO you got any kids?

732
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.790
Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.

733
00:55:54.534 --> 00:55:56.912
Anything at all can
and does happen.

734
00:55:57.411 --> 00:55:59.960
Same with wives,
for that matter.

735
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:01.548
You're married?

736
00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.796
Occasionally.

737
00:56:04.835 --> 00:56:09.261
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

738
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.024
Five, four, three,

739
00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.156
two, one.

740
00:56:37.326 --> 00:56:39.624
- That's odd.
- What?

741
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:42.214
Door security systems
are shutting down.

742
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:45.544
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

743
00:57:41.766 --> 00:57:43.894
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

744
00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.980
she's not available, is she?

745
00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.189
Why?

746
00:57:50.983 --> 00:57:52.735
I'm sorry. You two are...

747
00:57:52.818 --> 00:57:53.865
Yeah.

748
00:57:57.031 --> 00:57:58.283
What'd I touch?

749
00:57:58.407 --> 00:58:00.785
You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.

750
00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.633
What the hell?

751
00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:12.755
What now?

752
00:58:12.838 --> 00:58:14.761
Fences are failing
all over the park.

753
00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:17.264
Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.

754
00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:50.881
Just look at this work station.

755
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.553
What a complete slob.

756
00:58:52.628 --> 00:58:54.972
The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

757
00:59:01.679 --> 00:59:03.727
No, no. They're still on.

758
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.694
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

759
00:59:48.768 --> 00:59:50.611
Access main program.

760
00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:53.030
Access main security.

761
00:59:53.606 --> 00:59:55.153
Access main program grid.

762
01:00:04.492 --> 01:00:06.620
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

763
01:00:06.702 --> 01:00:10.582
Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

764
01:00:10.664 --> 01:00:14.214
Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.

765
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.172
Phones are out, too.

766
01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.268
Where did the vehicles stop?

767
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.242
Their radio's out, too.

768
01:00:46.325 --> 01:00:48.669
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

769
01:00:48.744 --> 01:00:50.872
I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

770
01:00:50.955 --> 01:00:52.798
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

771
01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:55.839
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

772
01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.038
I didn't say you were scared.

773
01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:58.261
I know.

774
01:00:59.213 --> 01:01:00.556
Boo!

775
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:04.093
Hey, where did you find those?

776
01:01:04.218 --> 01:01:05.720
In the box, under my seat.

777
01:01:05.803 --> 01:01:07.100
Are they heavy?

778
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:10.225
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

779
01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.653
Don't scare me.

780
01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:31.954
Cool. Night vision.

781
01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.238
Did you feel that?

782
01:02:32.848 --> 01:02:35.727
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

783
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.488
What is that?

784
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.877
Where's the goat?

785
01:03:20.771 --> 01:03:22.114
Jesus!

786
01:03:26.902 --> 01:03:28.904
He left us.

787
01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:42.759
Where does he think he's going?

788
01:03:42.835 --> 01:03:44.758
When you got to go,
you got to go.

789
01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.065
Dr. Grant.

790
01:04:16.827 --> 01:04:18.955
I hate being right all the time.

791
01:04:28.047 --> 01:04:32.223
Keep absolutely still. its
vision is based on movement.

792
01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.988
Turn the light off.

793
01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.703
Turn the light off!

794
01:05:50.254 --> 01:05:52.006
Hurry! Turn it off!

795
01:05:52.089 --> 01:05:53.215
I'm sorry!

796
01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.021
You're the one who turned it...

797
01:07:18.258 --> 01:07:19.726
Ian, freeze!

798
01:07:20.093 --> 01:07:21.515
Get the kids!

799
01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:23.471
Get rid of the flare!

800
01:07:23.513 --> 01:07:24.810
Get the kids!

801
01:07:25.766 --> 01:07:27.359
Get rid of the flare!

802
01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:32.110
Hail Mary, full of grace...

803
01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:50.707
No!

804
01:07:54.628 --> 01:07:56.096
Dr. Grant!

805
01:08:00.384 --> 01:08:03.012
I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.

806
01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.856
I'll get you next.
You're okay.

807
01:08:06.848 --> 01:08:08.225
You're all right.

808
01:08:08.976 --> 01:08:10.569
Tim!

809
01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:17.652
Don't move. He can't see
us if we don't move.

810
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.093
Lex, you're choking me.

811
01:09:27.512 --> 01:09:29.105
Grab the wire.

812
01:09:48.492 --> 01:09:52.417
"Keycheck space minus 0. Keychecks
off, safety space minus 0."

813
01:09:52.496 --> 01:09:55.716
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

814
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:59.216
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."

815
01:09:59.294 --> 01:10:01.672
It did it all.
With the keychecks off,

816
01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:03.132
the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.

817
01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:06.890
The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.

818
01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:08.641
How many lines of
code are there?

819
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.393
About two million.

820
01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.065
- Two million?
- Yeah.

821
01:10:14.851 --> 01:10:19.573
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep

822
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:23.402
and bring back my grandchildren.

823
01:10:24.236 --> 01:10:25.579
Sure.

824
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.038
I'm going with him.

825
01:10:33.078 --> 01:10:34.250
John.

826
01:10:40.085 --> 01:10:43.806
I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.

827
01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.348
Should have been there by now.

828
01:11:03.608 --> 01:11:04.905
Damn it!

829
01:11:11.616 --> 01:11:13.038
There's the road!

830
01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:23.633
Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.

831
01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:26.966
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

832
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:38.860
My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!

833
01:12:08.089 --> 01:12:11.434
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

834
01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:20.397
Hello.

835
01:12:25.023 --> 01:12:28.072
Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.

836
01:12:39.037 --> 01:12:40.459
Nice boy.

837
01:12:42.457 --> 01:12:44.084
Nice dinosaur.

838
01:12:44.918 --> 01:12:47.318
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

839
01:12:48.338 --> 01:12:50.761
What do you want?
A little food?

840
01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.342
Look at me.
I just fell down a hill.

841
01:12:52.425 --> 01:12:55.929
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

842
01:12:57.681 --> 01:13:00.480
Go on. Play fetch?

843
01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.316
Look, stick.

844
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:06.322
Look at stick.

845
01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:10.118
Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.

846
01:13:11.069 --> 01:13:12.946
You like the stick?
Go on and get it.

847
01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:15.331
No wonder you're extinct.

848
01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:19.035
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

849
01:14:35.362 --> 01:14:36.909
Timmy!

850
01:14:41.034 --> 01:14:42.251
Now, Lex. Listen.

851
01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.213
Lex, I'm right here.

852
01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:48.630
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

853
01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:51.177
Stay right here and wait for me.

854
01:14:51.252 --> 01:14:53.596
He left us.

855
01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:57.093
But that's not what
I'm going to do.

856
01:14:58.677 --> 01:14:59.849
Okay?

857
01:15:02.263 --> 01:15:03.640
Stay here.

858
01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.506
You hear me?
I'm coming up.

859
01:15:33.211 --> 01:15:37.182
I hate climbing. I hate
trees, way too high.

860
01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:06.704
You Okay?

861
01:16:09.539 --> 01:16:10.961
I threw up.

862
01:16:13.918 --> 01:16:15.135
That's okay.

863
01:16:16.087 --> 01:16:17.805
Just give me your hand.

864
01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:26.098
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

865
01:16:35.064 --> 01:16:36.566
Here, I've got you.

866
01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.365
Okay.

867
01:16:39.778 --> 01:16:42.372
That's good.
Over the rail.

868
01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:43.824
Don't pull me too hard.

869
01:16:48.161 --> 01:16:50.414
Stand on the door.
Hang on to me.

870
01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:56.966
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

871
01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.548
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

872
01:16:59.631 --> 01:17:01.383
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

873
01:17:02.842 --> 01:17:05.641
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

874
01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.518
This is impossible.

875
01:17:07.597 --> 01:17:08.974
How am I going to do this?
It's about...

876
01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:12.152
I'm going to help you
with your footing.

877
01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.441
Oh, no.

878
01:17:17.524 --> 01:17:18.571
Tim, go.

879
01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:42.928
Go, Tim, go!

880
01:17:50.974 --> 01:17:52.191
Faster, Tim!

881
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.283
Tim, jump!

882
01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:04.612
Go, Tim.

883
01:18:13.621 --> 01:18:16.625
We're back in the car again.

884
01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:20.845
At least you're out of the tree.

885
01:18:25.717 --> 01:18:28.186
Where's the other car?

886
01:18:30.597 --> 01:18:32.144
Alan!

887
01:18:32.891 --> 01:18:34.313
Dr. Grant!

888
01:18:50.283 --> 01:18:52.331
I think this was Gennaro.

889
01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:53.707
I think this was, too.

890
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:58.291
I think it's ahead of us.

891
01:18:58.374 --> 01:18:59.842
It could be anywhere.

892
01:18:59.918 --> 01:19:02.671
With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.

893
01:19:10.303 --> 01:19:13.557
He's put
a tourniquet on. Ian.

894
01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:16.894
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

895
01:19:21.731 --> 01:19:23.483
Can we chance moving him?

896
01:19:24.817 --> 01:19:26.535
Please chance it.

897
01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:36.420
Ellie, come on!

898
01:19:43.962 --> 01:19:45.430
It's the other car!

899
01:19:45.797 --> 01:19:47.640
Dr. Grant?

900
01:19:51.761 --> 01:19:53.263
They're not here.

901
01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:23.960
Anybody hear that?

902
01:20:27.588 --> 01:20:29.966
It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.

903
01:20:30.967 --> 01:20:32.765
I'm fairly alarmed here.

904
01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:37.770
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!

905
01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:40.021
Let's go.

906
01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.409
Must go faster.

907
01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:58.040
Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!

908
01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.215
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

909
01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.466
Look out!

910
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:36.874
Think they'll have
that on the tour?

911
01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:46.884
Are you hearing this?

912
01:21:53.216 --> 01:21:55.389
Come on, Tim.
Hurry up.

913
01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.312
Let's get up this tree.

914
01:22:01.015 --> 01:22:03.814
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

915
01:22:05.645 --> 01:22:06.862
Oh, man.

916
01:22:08.147 --> 01:22:09.490
I hate trees.

917
01:22:10.024 --> 01:22:11.321
They don't bother me.

918
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.994
Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.

919
01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:31.759
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

920
01:22:33.297 --> 01:22:34.765
They're singing.

921
01:23:04.078 --> 01:23:05.558
Don't let the monsters
come over here.

922
01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.084
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

923
01:23:09.542 --> 01:23:12.887
They only eat vegetables. For you,
I think they'd make an exception.

924
01:23:12.962 --> 01:23:14.635
I hate the other kind.

925
01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:19.931
They just do what they do.

926
01:23:39.655 --> 01:23:41.123
What's that?

927
01:23:46.078 --> 01:23:50.049
What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

928
01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:52.711
I don't know.

929
01:23:53.961 --> 01:23:56.714
I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.

930
01:24:00.051 --> 01:24:02.270
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

931
01:24:04.263 --> 01:24:06.482
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

932
01:24:06.557 --> 01:24:08.275
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

933
01:24:11.979 --> 01:24:14.482
What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?

934
01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:16.738
You got me.

935
01:24:16.817 --> 01:24:18.911
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex."

936
01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:22.490
Alan?

937
01:24:22.573 --> 01:24:23.665
Yeah?

938
01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.499
What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?

939
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:32.003
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

940
01:24:34.543 --> 01:24:35.886
All night.

941
01:25:25.886 --> 01:25:27.854
They were all melting.

942
01:25:31.309 --> 01:25:34.939
Malcolm's okay for now. I
gave him a shot of morphine.

943
01:25:38.357 --> 01:25:39.904
They'll be fine.

944
01:25:40.901 --> 01:25:45.202
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

945
01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.412
You know, the first

946
01:25:52.705 --> 01:25:56.175
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland

947
01:25:57.835 --> 01:26:00.509
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

948
01:26:01.714 --> 01:26:03.512
Really quite wonderful.

949
01:26:04.091 --> 01:26:07.345
I had a wee trapeze and a

950
01:26:10.556 --> 01:26:11.808
carousel

951
01:26:15.686 --> 01:26:17.108
and a seesaw.

952
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.449
They all move motorized,
of course.

953
01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:23.449
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas."

954
01:26:23.569 --> 01:26:25.287
"Can't you see the fleas?"

955
01:26:26.072 --> 01:26:30.373
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

956
01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.130
With this place,

957
01:26:40.127 --> 01:26:43.552
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

958
01:26:44.548 --> 01:26:47.643
Something that was real.
Something that they could

959
01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.307
see and touch.

960
01:26:56.977 --> 01:26:59.446
An aim not devoid of merit.

961
01:27:03.943 --> 01:27:07.573
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

962
01:27:09.782 --> 01:27:11.830
You're absolutely right.

963
01:27:13.327 --> 01:27:15.671
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

964
01:27:15.746 --> 01:27:18.420
We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.

965
01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:21.173
Next time,
everything's correctable.

966
01:27:21.961 --> 01:27:25.431
Creation is an act
of sheer will.

967
01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:29.806
Next time, it'll be flawless.

968
01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:33.514
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

969
01:27:33.597 --> 01:27:35.019
When we have control...

970
01:27:35.099 --> 01:27:37.852
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

971
01:27:37.935 --> 01:27:40.939
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

972
01:27:42.022 --> 01:27:43.444
I made a mistake, too.

973
01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:47.529
I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.

974
01:27:49.989 --> 01:27:53.493
The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.

975
01:27:55.327 --> 01:27:57.455
Alan and Lex and Tim.

976
01:27:59.039 --> 01:28:02.213
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

977
01:28:19.226 --> 01:28:20.648
It's good.

978
01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:26.113
Spared no expense.

979
01:28:53.177 --> 01:28:54.178
Go away!

980
01:28:54.261 --> 01:28:56.605
It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.

981
01:28:57.014 --> 01:28:59.688
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

982
01:29:00.226 --> 01:29:01.443
Veggie.

983
01:29:02.353 --> 01:29:04.105
Come on. Come on, girl.

984
01:29:08.275 --> 01:29:09.276
Come on, baby.

985
01:29:13.155 --> 01:29:14.623
Go.

986
01:29:16.283 --> 01:29:18.285
I'm not letting go.

987
01:29:29.505 --> 01:29:30.722
It looks like it has a cold.

988
01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.425
Yeah. Maybe.

989
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.677
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

990
01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.889
Just think of it
<i>as</i> kind of a big cow.

991
01:29:41.141 --> 01:29:42.984
I like cows.

992
01:29:52.444 --> 01:29:54.697
Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

993
01:30:02.246 --> 01:30:03.839
God bless you.

994
01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:10.887
- Yuck.
- Great.

995
01:30:10.963 --> 01:30:12.965
Now she'll never
try anything new.

996
01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.435
She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.

997
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:17.510
I'm a hacker.

998
01:30:17.553 --> 01:30:19.271
That's what I said.
You're a nerd.

999
01:30:19.346 --> 01:30:20.893
I am not a computer nerd.

1000
01:30:20.973 --> 01:30:22.725
I prefer to be called a hacker.

1001
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.193
God.

1002
01:30:28.897 --> 01:30:30.865
You know what this is?

1003
01:30:32.443 --> 01:30:34.445
It's a dinosaur egg.

1004
01:30:35.195 --> 01:30:38.369
The dinosaurs are breeding.

1005
01:30:41.535 --> 01:30:45.961
But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1006
01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:49.548
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

1007
01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.047
Well, on the tour,

1008
01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:58.136
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

1009
01:30:58.218 --> 01:31:01.939
They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code

1010
01:31:02.598 --> 01:31:05.226
and blended it with
that of frogs.

1011
01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:12.241
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female

1012
01:31:12.316 --> 01:31:14.410
in a single sex environment.

1013
01:31:16.236 --> 01:31:17.783
Malcolm was right.

1014
01:31:19.323 --> 01:31:20.540
Look.

1015
01:31:29.124 --> 01:31:30.842
Life found a way.

1016
01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:35.764
No. That's crazy.
You're out of your mind.

1017
01:31:35.839 --> 01:31:37.807
He's absolutely out of his mind.

1018
01:31:38.425 --> 01:31:40.223
Wait. What exactly
would this mean?

1019
01:31:40.511 --> 01:31:42.764
We're talking about
a calculated risk,

1020
01:31:42.846 --> 01:31:44.439
which is the only
option left to us.

1021
01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:49.567
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

1022
01:31:49.645 --> 01:31:52.524
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1023
01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:55.029
So, shutting down
the entire system...

1024
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.111
Get somebody else.
I won't do it.

1025
01:31:57.194 --> 01:32:02.746
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.

1026
01:32:03.492 --> 01:32:07.213
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back

1027
01:32:07.287 --> 01:32:09.836
on their original
start-up mode. Correct?

1028
01:32:10.416 --> 01:32:13.260
Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.

1029
01:32:13.335 --> 01:32:14.837
It may not come back on.

1030
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.217
Would we get the phones back?

1031
01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:18.382
Yes, again, in theory.

1032
01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:20.809
What about
the lysine contingency?

1033
01:32:20.884 --> 01:32:22.386
We could put that into effect.

1034
01:32:22.469 --> 01:32:23.469
What's that?

1035
01:32:23.512 --> 01:32:25.264
That's absolutely out
of the question.

1036
01:32:25.347 --> 01:32:28.226
The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,

1037
01:32:28.308 --> 01:32:30.151
if they ever get off the island.

1038
01:32:30.227 --> 01:32:33.902
Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1039
01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:36.905
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

1040
01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:40.784
Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1041
01:32:40.863 --> 01:32:43.491
People are dying.

1042
01:32:47.494 --> 01:32:49.872
Will you please shut
down the system?

1043
01:33:11.894 --> 01:33:13.771
Hold on to your butts.

1044
01:33:33.457 --> 01:33:34.629
It's okay.

1045
01:33:34.708 --> 01:33:37.382
Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.

1046
01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.882
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

1047
01:33:42.382 --> 01:33:43.975
Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1048
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:46.474
Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:

1049
01:33:46.553 --> 01:33:49.898
telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.

1050
01:33:49.973 --> 01:33:52.317
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

1051
01:33:52.392 --> 01:33:54.269
Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.

1052
01:33:54.353 --> 01:33:56.947
Three minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.

1053
01:33:57.022 --> 01:34:00.242
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker

1054
01:34:00.317 --> 01:34:03.947
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.

1055
01:34:04.029 --> 01:34:05.406
- I'm tired.
- I'm dirty.

1056
01:34:05.489 --> 01:34:06.991
I'm hot.

1057
01:34:07.074 --> 01:34:10.829
Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile

1058
01:34:11.495 --> 01:34:14.795
over that rise there.
Just keep...

1059
01:34:17.668 --> 01:34:19.170
What is that?

1060
01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:22.781
Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

1061
01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:26.435
They are

1062
01:34:30.514 --> 01:34:31.561
Gallimimus.

1063
01:34:32.057 --> 01:34:34.856
Are those meat-eating?

1064
01:34:36.186 --> 01:34:37.312
"Meat-asauruses"?

1065
01:34:42.901 --> 01:34:44.949
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

1066
01:34:45.028 --> 01:34:47.497
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

1067
01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:52.620
They're flocking this way.

1068
01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:36.330
I want to go now.

1069
01:35:36.413 --> 01:35:37.539
Just look how it eats.

1070
01:35:37.623 --> 01:35:38.920
Please.

1071
01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:41.673
I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.

1072
01:35:41.752 --> 01:35:43.846
- Yes.
- Go now.

1073
01:35:45.756 --> 01:35:48.430
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

1074
01:35:50.844 --> 01:35:52.642
Look how much blood.

1075
01:35:54.848 --> 01:35:56.976
God. Something went wrong.

1076
01:35:57.851 --> 01:36:01.401
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

1077
01:36:04.107 --> 01:36:05.700
This is just a delay.

1078
01:36:05.776 --> 01:36:09.030
That's all it is. All major
theme parks have delays.

1079
01:36:09.112 --> 01:36:13.458
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.

1080
01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:16.207
If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

1081
01:36:16.286 --> 01:36:17.486
the pirates don't eat tourists.

1082
01:36:17.496 --> 01:36:21.091
I can't wait any more.
Somethings wrong.

1083
01:36:21.166 --> 01:36:22.543
I'm gonna go get
the power back on.

1084
01:36:22.834 --> 01:36:26.008
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?

1085
01:36:26.088 --> 01:36:29.262
Don't be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...

1086
01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:33.474
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

1087
01:36:49.653 --> 01:36:50.700
Sorry.

1088
01:36:54.783 --> 01:36:59.038
Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.

1089
01:36:59.121 --> 01:37:02.500
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1090
01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.137
Right.

1091
01:37:14.136 --> 01:37:16.230
But it ought to be me,
really, going.

1092
01:37:16.304 --> 01:37:17.305
Why?

1093
01:37:17.389 --> 01:37:19.312
I'm a... And you're a...

1094
01:37:20.642 --> 01:37:22.986
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

1095
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:26.235
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

1096
01:37:26.314 --> 01:37:29.989
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

1097
01:37:30.068 --> 01:37:31.411
Right.

1098
01:38:07.022 --> 01:38:09.775
The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.

1099
01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.405
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1100
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:20.952
Come on, this way.

1101
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:30.804
I can see the shed from here.

1102
01:38:30.879 --> 01:38:32.847
We can make it if we run.

1103
01:38:32.964 --> 01:38:35.513
No. We can't.

1104
01:38:36.426 --> 01:38:38.019
Why not?

1105
01:38:38.095 --> 01:38:40.018
Because we're being hunted.

1106
01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:43.517
In the bushes, straight ahead.

1107
01:38:46.103 --> 01:38:47.946
It's all right.

1108
01:38:48.021 --> 01:38:49.739
Like hell it is.

1109
01:38:50.732 --> 01:38:53.906
Run. Towards the shed.

1110
01:38:56.113 --> 01:38:57.581
I've got her.

1111
01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:00.034
Go. Now!

1112
01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.596
Mr. Arnold?

1113
01:39:25.934 --> 01:39:27.527
John, I'm in.

1114
01:39:27.769 --> 01:39:28.986
<i>Great.</i>

1115
01:39:30.272 --> 01:39:33.776
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

1116
01:39:34.734 --> 01:39:37.078
<i>Okay. Going down.</i>

1117
01:39:38.029 --> 01:39:41.784
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1118
01:39:41.867 --> 01:39:43.067
Have her follow the main cable.

1119
01:39:43.076 --> 01:39:45.295
I know how to read a schematic.

1120
01:40:15.317 --> 01:40:16.819
I guess that means
the power's off.

1121
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:32.167
That's not funny.

1122
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:33.627
That was great.

1123
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:37.844
Well, maybe we, we could...

1124
01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:58.193
Damn it. Dead end.

1125
01:40:58.568 --> 01:40:59.990
Wait a minute.

1126
01:41:01.363 --> 01:41:04.663
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

1127
01:41:05.533 --> 01:41:06.580
Look above you.

1128
01:41:08.245 --> 01:41:11.966
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

1129
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.462
Follow that.

1130
01:41:13.875 --> 01:41:16.048
Okay. Following the piping.

1131
01:41:18.713 --> 01:41:23.184
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1132
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.432
What would you give me?

1133
01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:25.603
Respect.

1134
01:41:26.554 --> 01:41:28.602
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1135
01:41:30.267 --> 01:41:31.860
I see the box.

1136
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:36.319
It says, "High Voltage."
Yeah.

1137
01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:40.531
Okay.

1138
01:41:44.447 --> 01:41:47.121
Good. Here we go.

1139
01:41:47.784 --> 01:41:49.001
Over the top.

1140
01:41:49.619 --> 01:41:51.246
Take your time.

1141
01:41:51.997 --> 01:41:53.089
Good. Come on.

1142
01:41:53.999 --> 01:41:55.922
Find your footing.

1143
01:41:58.169 --> 01:42:00.888
You can't throw
the main switch by hand.

1144
01:42:00.964 --> 01:42:04.389
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1145
01:42:04.467 --> 01:42:06.811
It's large, flat, and gray.

1146
01:42:07.595 --> 01:42:09.723
All right, here I go. Okay?

1147
01:42:11.057 --> 01:42:16.530
One, two, three, four.

1148
01:42:16.604 --> 01:42:18.698
Okay, charged.

1149
01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:22.945
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button

1150
01:42:23.028 --> 01:42:25.372
which says "Push to Close."

1151
01:42:25.905 --> 01:42:27.748
Push to close.

1152
01:42:31.244 --> 01:42:32.541
Push it.

1153
01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:51.432
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1154
01:42:52.265 --> 01:42:53.266
Switch them on.

1155
01:43:04.861 --> 01:43:05.862
Get down now!

1156
01:43:05.945 --> 01:43:07.071
You're gonna have to jump.

1157
01:43:07.155 --> 01:43:09.249
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

1158
01:43:09.324 --> 01:43:10.541
Do what Dr. Grant says!

1159
01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:11.960
Let go.
I'll count to three.

1160
01:43:12.035 --> 01:43:14.458
One, two, three!

1161
01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:18.049
Four. Five.

1162
01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:20.210
I'm coming up to get you.

1163
01:43:20.293 --> 01:43:21.966
I've got to get Tim.

1164
01:43:22.045 --> 01:43:23.718
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

1165
01:43:26.257 --> 01:43:27.304
One.

1166
01:43:29.594 --> 01:43:30.641
Two...

1167
01:43:41.773 --> 01:43:43.150
He's not breathing.

1168
01:43:47.695 --> 01:43:50.665
I think we're back in business!

1169
01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:00.254
No!

1170
01:44:10.552 --> 01:44:12.099
Mr. Arnold.

1171
01:45:30.215 --> 01:45:31.967
Clever girl.

1172
01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:57.246
No, Tim!

1173
01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:01.876
Good boy.

1174
01:46:06.459 --> 01:46:07.631
Three.

1175
01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.096
Hello?

1176
01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:27.485
Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.

1177
01:46:28.606 --> 01:46:31.325
Get you to a doctor.

1178
01:46:33.361 --> 01:46:35.659
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1179
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.958
Your hair is all sticking up.

1180
01:46:40.952 --> 01:46:43.205
Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.

1181
01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.673
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

1182
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:18.122
Run.

1183
01:48:34.607 --> 01:48:36.575
Just the two Raptors, right?

1184
01:48:38.069 --> 01:48:39.912
You sure the third
one's contained?

1185
01:48:39.987 --> 01:48:43.617
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1186
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.062
What is it?

1187
01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:13.488
It's a Velociraptor.

1188
01:49:16.065 --> 01:49:17.738
It's inside.

1189
01:49:42.842 --> 01:49:43.889
Follow me.

1190
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:21.508
It's in there.

1191
01:52:21.918 --> 01:52:23.386
Control room.

1192
01:52:29.508 --> 01:52:30.600
We can call for help?

1193
01:52:30.676 --> 01:52:33.020
We've got to reboot
the system first.

1194
01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.358
The door locks!

1195
01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:39.898
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1196
01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:51.205
No, boot up the door locks!

1197
01:52:52.073 --> 01:52:54.292
Get back! Boot up
the door locks.

1198
01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:55.835
You can't hold it by yourself!

1199
01:53:04.543 --> 01:53:08.047
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

1200
01:53:08.798 --> 01:53:10.892
It's all the files
of the whole park.

1201
01:53:10.967 --> 01:53:14.346
It tells you everything. I've
got to find the right file.

1202
01:53:14.971 --> 01:53:16.223
Try to reach the gun.

1203
01:53:25.356 --> 01:53:27.324
I can't get it unless I move.

1204
01:53:42.748 --> 01:53:44.876
This is it. This might
be the right file.

1205
01:53:46.794 --> 01:53:48.296
This isn't the right file.

1206
01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:52.596
Come on, Lex!

1207
01:54:00.933 --> 01:54:02.355
- You got it!
- Yes!

1208
01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:07.357
Did it!

1209
01:54:07.606 --> 01:54:08.732
Yes!

1210
01:54:13.195 --> 01:54:14.412
What works?

1211
01:54:14.488 --> 01:54:17.207
All security systems
are enabled. We got it.

1212
01:54:27.084 --> 01:54:28.131
Grant.

1213
01:54:28.377 --> 01:54:31.677
Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.

1214
01:54:31.756 --> 01:54:33.053
The children all right?

1215
01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:34.850
<i>The children are fine.</i>

1216
01:54:34.925 --> 01:54:38.975
Call the mainland. Tell them
to send the damn helicopters.

1217
01:54:39.597 --> 01:54:41.315
It's gonna cut
through the glass!

1218
01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:34.698
Move!

1219
01:56:20.197 --> 01:56:22.746
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1220
01:57:39.985 --> 01:57:44.582
After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.

1221
01:57:45.157 --> 01:57:46.249
So have I.

1222
01:58:34.164 --> 01:58:35.632
Come on.
