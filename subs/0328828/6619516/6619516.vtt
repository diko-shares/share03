1
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.658
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

2
00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.709
You know,
living at my parents' house,

3
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.003
that's a temporary thing.

4
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.882
We've been going out for,
what, three years.

5
00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.593
You're not, like,
getting bored with things, are you?

6
00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:54.846
Michelle, I'm gonna
ask you something

7
00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.140
that I've never
asked you before.

8
00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.433
Is it kinky?

9
00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.143
I don't think so. No.

10
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.894
You don't have
to be embarrassed

11
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.440
if you wanna add more spiciness to our relationship.

12
00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:08.192
Actually,

13
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.612
maybe you could just,
you know,

14
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:13.781
use your napkin.

15
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.032
My napkin?

16
00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.327
Mr. Levenstein?
Yes.

17
00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:19.912
You have a phone call.
Excuse me.

18
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.539
Thank you.

19
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.125
Hello?
Jim, it's Dad.

20
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.918
You left the ring at home.

21
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.880
The box is empty.
But I'm on my way,

22
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:33.426
and I've got the ring,
so don't panic, Son. Okay? Bye.

23
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.345
Who was that?

24
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.681
Uh...

25
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.684
That was my dad.
That was my dad.

26
00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:45.021
He couldn't get through on...
I didn't answer my cell,

27
00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.441
so he was getting all worried.
You know how he is.

28
00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.695
But everything is okay now.
Everything is perfectly fine.

29
00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:56.032
I think I know what
you're gonna ask me.

30
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.870
That's okay. I don't
have to use my napkin.

31
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.663
What?

32
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.081
I've got my own techniques.

33
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.505
Michelle, where you going?
Michelle?

34
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.175
Okay.

35
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.887
Michelle. Okay.

36
00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.724
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Michelle.

37
00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:22.934
Psst!

38
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.354
I think you need to stop.
Okay, keep going.

39
00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.316
Oh, my God. Michelle?

40
00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:34.111
Michelle...

41
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.281
Oh, my God.

42
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.491
Okay.

43
00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:39.659
Well, I made it.

44
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.577
Where's Michelle? Washroom?

45
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.996
I was so nervous
she was gonna spot me.

46
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.832
Here's the ring, Son.
Oh!

47
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.584
Let me tell you something.
This is some ring.

48
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.587
Look at the rock on this baby,
Mr. Big Spender.

49
00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.506
I hope you didn't blow your wad on this, Son.

50
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.757
Not yet.

51
00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.761
Your mother and I could not be more thrilled for you, Jim.

52
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.096
I mean, we're so happy.

53
00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:02.515
And I know you're excited,
I can see it in your face.

54
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.934
I mean, you look like
you're ready to burst.

55
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.686
I mean, your cheeks,
they're flush.

56
00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.271
I wish your mother
could be here.

57
00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.689
Not me.
That's what I wish.

58
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.276
You know, this is one
of those moments, Jim,

59
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.279
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

60
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.613
Yes, it is.

61
00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:21.200
You bet it is.

62
00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:24.161
I cannot believe my son
is gonna pop the question.

63
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.455
What was that?

64
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:27.623
That?

65
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:34.297
Knocking on wood. What is this...
Popping what? What question?

66
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:35.423
You're a wreck.

67
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.549
What?

68
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.219
You need some air. You need some air.
Okay, walk me to my car.

69
00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:41.429
No, I'm not walking...

70
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:42.722
Listen to me!
It's for your good.

71
00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:45.057
Dad.

72
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.809
Oh! Son!
My pants!

73
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.352
Your penis!

74
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.896
I got my pants, Dad!

75
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.230
What the hell...

76
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.691
Jeez! God, Dad.

77
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.067
Wear your pants.

78
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.069
I got the pants!
What are you doing?

79
00:03:57.154 --> 00:03:58.362
He had abdominal cramps...

80
00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.739
I can explain all this.

81
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.490
Everybody calm
down here, quiet!

82
00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.326
Lower your voice.

83
00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.621
Disgusting.

84
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.460
Now,

85
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.005
I came here to do something,

86
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.467
and damn it,
I'm gonna do it.

87
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.973
Michelle?

88
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.395
Hello, dear.

89
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.859
Michelle Annabeth Flaherty,

90
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.236
I love you

91
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:45.660
more than I could ever explain at this particular moment.

92
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.500
Dad, the ring.

93
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.044
Oh.

94
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.717
Will you marry me?

95
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:03.386
Yes.

96
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.023
My son.

97
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:30.037
I'm the happiest
man in the world.

98
00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.168
We should all be so happy.

99
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.871
Cheers. Gentlemen.
Sweetheart.

100
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.833
I'm impressed.

101
00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.335
Marriage is a binding,

102
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.380
unifying, eternal,

103
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:27.553
never-ending, permanent chaining together of two people.

104
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.515
Jim, have you
thought this through?

105
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.933
Yes.

106
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:37.021
Finch, thank you.
I had been trying to figure it out for a while.

107
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.940
You know, when is the right time?
Is there a right time?

108
00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.986
Then finally I realized, "Duh,
you love the girl. Marry her."

109
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.279
Aw.

110
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.074
Oh! Let's dance.

111
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.659
Dance? No.

112
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.579
No, you have to learn sometime.
Come on.

113
00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.710
Don't laugh at me.

114
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.130
Yeah, okay.

115
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.382
Just glad that's not me.

116
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:06.967
Finch,

117
00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.220
you don't think
there's one girl

118
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.722
you're destined to spend your entire life with?

119
00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:14.934
They're all for me, Kevin.

120
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.521
Not so bad? All right.

121
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.481
Do this.

122
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.025
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.945
The wedding should be
rather entertaining.

124
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.334
Bro, that's it?

125
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.379
There's no keg anywhere.

126
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.590
Jim.
Hey, John.

127
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:50.094
The food and
the drink are really bad.

128
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.305
"F" for presentation.
The good news for you...

129
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.515
What's that?

130
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.226
We're gonna be
ushers at the wedding.

131
00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.732
This is amazing.
I don't recognize half the people in this place.

132
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.527
At least they
all brought gifts.

133
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:07.820
Hello.

134
00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.196
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

135
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:10.489
Oh! Hello!

136
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.866
Harold Flaherty.

137
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.534
Hi.
How lovely to meet you.

138
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.203
Please come in.
We've been expecting you.

139
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:17.413
How was your trip?

140
00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:18.664
Delightful.

141
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.833
Who's excited
about the wedding?

142
00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.043
Anxious might
be more accurate.

143
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.421
We've never met your son.

144
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.131
You'll get to meet him.

145
00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.258
Rudy and Sam would
like to meet him, too.

146
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.384
Better bring them
in from the car.

147
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.552
They've been
cooped up for hours.

148
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.470
For heaven's sake.
You brought your sons?

149
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:34.638
Our dogs.

150
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:35.890
We never travel without them.

151
00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.057
Oh, my goodness.

152
00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:40.477
Well, honey,
why don't you go get those critters out of the car

153
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.687
and we'll start
on some cocktails.

154
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.938
Thank you.

155
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.440
I'd love one.
Long trip?

156
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.025
I'll get the dogs.

157
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.403
There's one thing that'll make this wedding perfect.

158
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.155
No Stifler.

159
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.866
That's one dick
we are not inviting.

160
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.242
Motion seconded.

161
00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.619
Motion carried.

162
00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:01.165
So, Finch,
what are you gonna do with that fancy NYU diploma?

163
00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.833
I'll frame it.

164
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.294
Then I'll write my memoirs.

165
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.171
You should come
to law school, man.

166
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.131
You know I could
use the company.

167
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.217
Kids, Michelle's parents are here.
Come on, we're waiting.

168
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.345
Oh, crumbs on the shirt.
That's bad.

169
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.513
Okay, that's fine.
I'll change. I'll change.

170
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.018
Fuckers!

171
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.740
Well, polish my nuts
and serve me a milkshake.

172
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.456
What's up?

173
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.503
That's right.

174
00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.176
Oh! Cake?
Hope it's good.

175
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:58.263
Oh, gee.

176
00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.475
Thanks for inviting me to the graduation party, fucker.

177
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:10.943
Oh! Fucking right, doggy.
That's good cake! Holy shit!

178
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:12.945
Hi. How are you?
Congratulations.

179
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.780
Hey...

180
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.035
"Congratulation, Jism!"

181
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.538
Excuse me. Stifler?

182
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.123
Hey, Jim!

183
00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.457
Stifler,
what are you doing here?

184
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.500
Okay, man...

185
00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:27.626
Happy fuckday, assmouth!

186
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.752
Put the cake down.

187
00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:29.878
Check it out.
I made it all by myself.

188
00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.463
Cute.
What happened to my invite?

189
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.715
Got lost in the mail,
fuckface?

190
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.799
Quiet!

191
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.468
Bite yourself.
That's what I thought.

192
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:37.720
I think I can
spell "Cajun Rectum."

193
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.054
Seriously, man.

194
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.305
Oh, Jesus.

195
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:41.640
Damn it, Stifler.

196
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:42.766
Jim, look what you did!

197
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:43.976
Look what I did?

198
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.729
Look at this shit!
What am I supposed to do now?

199
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.565
Are you happy now, man?
Why are you here?

200
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:50.899
My dick looks like
a corn dog.

201
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.401
I got cake
all over my balls.

202
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.069
Jim, honey?

203
00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.154
Shit.

204
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.697
The Flahertys are waiting.

205
00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.323
Do you think
he's upstairs, honey?

206
00:10:58.408 --> 00:10:59.742
Oh, you're fucked now, Jim.

207
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.292
Stifler, get up.

208
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:09.668
This dog's great!

209
00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.420
Is it weird
that it feels good?

210
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.006
All right...

211
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.966
What about the dining room?

212
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.342
I know you'll just love him.

213
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.053
Jesus, Stifler.

214
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:21.889
Stop enjoying it so much.

215
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.348
Lick it up!

216
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.438
You little shit.
Take your pants off, man.

217
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.275
Good Lord!

218
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.693
Oh, God!
Jim?

219
00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:36.320
No, it's not
what it looks like.

220
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.030
What are you doing, Son?

221
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.907
My dogs!
Don't go in there, darling!

222
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.200
Lord knows what
they'll do to you!

223
00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:42.534
I love this dog!

224
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.203
I was trying to
get him off, Dad.

225
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.954
That is your son?

226
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.998
Back away from the animal.

227
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.084
Mr. And Mrs. Flaherty,
I presume.

228
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.710
Where are you going?

229
00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.464
Well, lunch is served.

230
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.884
I really hope

231
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.889
That we can all just forget about this,
and move on, and start again.

232
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.599
Start again fresh.

233
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.477
Jim, if you hope to be
the provider and protector

234
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.646
for our firstborn daughter,

235
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.189
you have a long way to go.

236
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:13.774
Thank you, sir.

237
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.151
They think
you're an angel

238
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.530
and I'm just some
ungrateful dog rapist.

239
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.617
They just think they raised
the proper little band girl.

240
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.120
And, besides, sometimes

241
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.997
it's nice to be
more traditional.

242
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.999
How so? How do
you mean traditional?

243
00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.502
I'm thinking
about the wedding.

244
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.421
How it's just this one day,

245
00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:40.759
one day where everyone's eyes are on me for a change.

246
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.095
I've just never
walked into a room

247
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.431
and had everyone go,
"Ooh" and "Ah"

248
00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:48.851
and "Isn't she elegant?"

249
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.479
That is exactly how our wedding is going to be.

250
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.273
I promise.

251
00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:00.779
Shit. I got a frosted
ass crack. Hey, Finch?

252
00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.365
You want this
for here or to go?

253
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.952
"A witty saying
proves nothing." Voltaire.

254
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.580
"Suck my dick." Ron Jeremy.

255
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.041
Boys, anybody seen
the bride's parents?

256
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.043
No? Hmm.

257
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.255
Wait a second.

258
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.631
Come on, Stifler.

259
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:20.716
This isn't
a graduation party.

260
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.842
It's time to go.

261
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:25.429
Wait, hold on!
Jim's getting married, isn't he?

262
00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.056
Holy fucking shit!
This is major!

263
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.225
Do you have the slightest idea
how important this is?

264
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.270
We get to have
a bachelor party. Yes!

265
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:36.273
We celebrate the death of Jim
with a party in his honor.

266
00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.192
Chicks and boobs.
Tits and ass.

267
00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.110
Titties, ta-tas,
casabas, bazoongas,

268
00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.945
all up in our frigging faces!

269
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.114
Come on, buck up, fellows!
Show some enthusiasm!

270
00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.367
It's gonna be fucking great!
Oh, my God!

271
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.330
Finch,
he does make a good point.

272
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.081
Yeah, he does.

273
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.296
You never heard me say that.

274
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.424
I do not deserve
a girl this cool.

275
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.968
Michelle said the wedding
was doable, right?

276
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.054
A wedding. A wedding, yeah.

277
00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:11.058
I promised her her wedding.
You know, the wedding of her dreams.

278
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.351
Okay, what's the problem?

279
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.727
Dancing.

280
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:16.647
She's gonna want to dance.
There's that whole tradition.

281
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.273
The first dance
at the reception.

282
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.734
She is gonna wanna dance
Fred Astaire kind of shit.

283
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.944
I can't do that.

284
00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.363
She learned all
that from band camp.

285
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.240
Okay, so you take lessons,
you know. Right away.

286
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.368
Lessons. Okay.
I have to convince

287
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.536
her parents that
I'm not a shithead.

288
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.080
Yeah, challenging.

289
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.164
Indeed challenging.

290
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.166
But doable. What else?

291
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.086
What else? I don't know what else.
That's the thing.

292
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.004
She cares
too much to tell me.

293
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.840
She doesn't want me to worry
that she might be worried.

294
00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.175
So I'm worried.

295
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.593
Recon.

296
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.140
You mean, like,
spying on Michelle?

297
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.518
Spying is deceitful.

298
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.897
Extra attention
means you're concerned.

299
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:00.399
This is true.
This is good.

300
00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.984
Guys,

301
00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.694
here's to the next step.

302
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.070
Shut up with that stepping.

303
00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.530
Put your glass down.

304
00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:40.188
We'll find a wonderful one
somewhere, I promise.

305
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.065
We'll keep looking.

306
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.405
Is everything okay here?
The study can get a little chilly sometimes.

307
00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.531
You have enough blankets?

308
00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:50.782
We're fine. Thank you.

309
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.868
I was kind of hoping

310
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.747
that someday soon,
we could have a little talk.

311
00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.832
I'd really like to tell you

312
00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:01.585
why I think I'll make
a good husband,

313
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.211
whenever you get a chance.

314
00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:04.713
Oh! Why is that?

315
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.298
Come on.

316
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.846
See, I was saying
that soon we could talk.

317
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.641
This right now is sort
of the preliminary talk

318
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.771
before the future
longer talk,

319
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.607
which would be like a quiet,

320
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.650
a private dinner talk.

321
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.403
Let him finish.

322
00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.991
I'm talking to you.

323
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.868
Okay.

324
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.456
Good talking to you.

325
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.004
No. These aren't gonna work.

326
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.508
Wow!

327
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.096
You guys in a sporting goods store.
Very good.

328
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.014
Hey, Finch,

329
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.184
I think they got your size.

330
00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:00.560
Oh, beautiful.

331
00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.771
Jim needs to learn to
dance for his wedding.

332
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.107
You know,
I think he's screwed.

333
00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:07.818
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

334
00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.445
I can't wait to
see this disaster.

335
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.406
What makes you think
you're invited?

336
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:22.624
I already called up
Jim's mom. Got the info.

337
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.918
I'm preparing for
the festivities.

338
00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:28.755
It's time for me to boom-boom with the bridesmaids, Finchfucker.

339
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.800
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

340
00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:36.471
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

341
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.224
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

342
00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.144
All right, Stifler.

343
00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.147
This is a little
difficult to explain.

344
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:49.359
Look, you're okay.
You're okay.

345
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.610
I mean, I like you.

346
00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:51.903
Yeah, great.

347
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:55.323
You can blow me after practice.
I'm working, dude.

348
00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.910
Come on! Work it! Hustle!

349
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.412
See, my mom
didn't know that...

350
00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:01.997
Push it! Move it! Come on!

351
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.582
There was a misunderstanding.

352
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.708
You're not invited!

353
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:05.917
Hold!

354
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.382
Dude, how the hell do you even think you're getting married?

355
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:15.302
I've been looking out for your sex life since high school.

356
00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:17.179
You what?
Oh! Oh!

357
00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.895
The first tits this guy ever saw were because of me!

358
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:27.439
The first girl
he ever hooked up with

359
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:30.275
was at my party,
at my cottage!

360
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.694
That girl's
the girl he's marrying.

361
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.905
The Stiffman
showed him the way.

362
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.240
Can I get a hallelujah?

363
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.159
Hallelujah, Stifler!

364
00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.119
But, my fuckers,

365
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:44.289
this mofo right here does not want the Stifmeister,

366
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.083
the Grand fucking Facilitator
to attend the wedding.

367
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.752
Who sucks donkey dick?

368
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.545
Jim sucks donkey dick!

369
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:53.590
The answer's no, okay?
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:54.674
The answer's no.

371
00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.800
I can dance.

372
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.010
What?

373
00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.054
I can dance.

374
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:04.142
Five, six, seven, eight...

375
00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.980
Okay. What exactly
is this here?

376
00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:11.191
Left box turn.

377
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.525
Left box turn. Okay.

378
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.694
Hi. Stop looking
into my eyes.

379
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.071
Sorry. Sorry.

380
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:18.615
Now how do you know this?
How do you know how to do this?

381
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.700
My mom made me take it
for three fuckin' years.

382
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.244
Yeah?
I hated it.

383
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.872
No, you're really good.
You should take ballet or something.

384
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.290
Fuckface!

385
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.750
What part of
"this sucks my ass"

386
00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.293
do you not
under-fuckin'-stand?

387
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.212
This is exactly what I'm talking about, Steven.

388
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:35.757
You can't behave like this.
If you wanna come to the wedding,

389
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.467
I'm sorry,
you cannot act like this.

390
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.135
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

391
00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.929
Impolite would
be an improvement.

392
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.640
Look, just try not to be,

393
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.141
you know, you.

394
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.981
Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

395
00:19:51.065 --> 00:19:53.024
Wait, Stifler. Hold on.

396
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:56.569
Okay, what if you planned
the bachelor party?

397
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:57.988
With a dildo show?

398
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.868
Sure. If you can find the time to fit it in,
go ahead.

399
00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.495
Surprise me.
Sorry, chief.

400
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.038
It only gets
you halfway there.

401
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:08.456
What do you mean?

402
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.710
I need assurances that I'm gonna get
some quality action at this wedding.

403
00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.753
I'm sorry,
I can't make that promise.

404
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.298
Well, let me put it
to you this way, Jimbo.

405
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:20.468
No pussy, no dancing. Okay?

406
00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:23.471
No pussy, no dancing.

407
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.348
How's that for polite?

408
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.981
Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

409
00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.900
Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

410
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.196
The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

411
00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.825
If we leave right now,
we can get there by the time they close.

412
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:44.993
It's a three-hour drive.

413
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.244
Three-hour drive?

414
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:50.165
Kick fucking ass!
Are we going to Chicago to see titties?

415
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:53.543
We are talking about getting Michelle a dress in Chicago.

416
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.587
Now, please vanish.

417
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.881
Hey, Finch, what's
the capital of Thailand?

418
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.425
Bang cock.

419
00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.845
Dude...
Okay, I got shotgun.

420
00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:12.437
Let's get this
dress shit over with.

421
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.774
The strip bar's got free hot wings before 7:00.

422
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.694
Now, Jim, let me handle this.
These are my people.

423
00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.945
They're gay?

424
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.572
No, you bleeding imbecile,

425
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:26.076
they have style. They're cultured.
They're sophisticated.

426
00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:27.786
So they're gay.

427
00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:31.247
So, mademoiselle,
I'm sure that you can appreciate

428
00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:34.709
that monsieur here is stuck right between Scylla and Charybdis.

429
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.420
Yes, I'm afraid
he's no Ulysses.

430
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.130
Okay, what's happening here?

431
00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.424
You need to speak
to my dressmaker.

432
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.468
That's who would
actually make the dress,

433
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.762
and I'm afraid Leslie
has gone for the day.

434
00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:57.774
All right, she said
she'd probably be at

435
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.317
one of these bars
here on Halstead.

436
00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:02.320
I say we split up, ask around
for a Leslie Summers.

437
00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:03.613
Right.

438
00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:21.756
Hey there,
sweet little thing.

439
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:23.967
Hey there,
you sweet manly thing.

440
00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.052
You know,
I really love your shirt.

441
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.554
Do I know you?

442
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.264
I'm Jennifer.

443
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:34.310
Well, Jennifer, just relax, take it slow,
and let the good times roll,

444
00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:36.271
because Daddy's
a regular here!

445
00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:37.856
Do you wanna get a drink?

446
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.150
You're goddamn right I do.

447
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:44.529
Two cold ones.

448
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.365
You know, my friend would
really dig your vibe.

449
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.450
Will you wait here?

450
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:49.492
Sure thing, babe.

451
00:22:49.577 --> 00:22:51.411
Good.
All right.

452
00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.413
How you feeling, sexy?

453
00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.622
Pretty good.

454
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.875
Whoa! You have a deep voice.

455
00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:58.334
That's not all.

456
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:00.712
Oh! Right.

457
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.256
You look
really cute tonight.

458
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.091
Thanks. I guess.

459
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.302
What the...

460
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:11.681
Oh, hey!
Feeling a little frisky?

461
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:12.849
Oh!

462
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:16.019
Game over.
What's happening here?

463
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:20.940
Hey. Any luck?

464
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.442
Not so much.

465
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.152
All right, let's...

466
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.115
This is Bear.

467
00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:30.658
Hey!

468
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.036
Wow, you are a bear.

469
00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:36.664
Yeah.

470
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:39.876
How much you bench?

471
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.377
How much you weigh?

472
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.922
Why? You wanna try
and pick me up?

473
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.466
Yeah, I think I could.

474
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.218
Yeah, I bet you could.

475
00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:51.888
You are big.
I could use a guy like you on my team.

476
00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:56.518
Are you talking about our team?
Or an actual team?

477
00:23:56.936 --> 00:24:00.813
What the hell is "our team"?
Hi, where's the girl?

478
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.358
What the fuck
are we talking about?

479
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.985
You need to take
another look around.

480
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:10.532
You look fabulous!

481
00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:11.866
Hey, honey.

482
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.702
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is going on?

483
00:24:17.414 --> 00:24:19.832
Come on,
is that all you've got?

484
00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:22.502
Pussy!

485
00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:26.381
I must have came to the wrong place.
Stifler.

486
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.508
Stifler.
Oh, man.

487
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.385
Hey.
It's so good to see you.

488
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.887
How did you get up the nerve
to check out a gay bar?

489
00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:36.099
Really don't wanna talk about it right now.
I just wanna go home.

490
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.225
Your friend here
was just leaving.

491
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.309
Eat shit.

492
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:39.769
Did you find Leslie?

493
00:24:39.895 --> 00:24:41.271
Fuck your stupid dressmaker.

494
00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:42.897
You guys know Leslie Summers?

495
00:24:43.023 --> 00:24:44.607
We're trying to find her.

496
00:24:46.777 --> 00:24:48.528
You know what?
I think you guys are out of luck.

497
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:49.612
Why don't you go home?

498
00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.823
No. You know Leslie Summers?
He knows her.

499
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:54.993
My friends and I,
we just drove all the way from Michigan

500
00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:57.704
to find my fiancée the wedding dress that she deserves.

501
00:24:57.788 --> 00:24:59.414
We need Leslie
to make it for us.

502
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.207
Can you please
help us find her?

503
00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:04.544
I'm sure Leslie always helps
associates of assholes.

504
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.382
What are you looking at?
I'm not a steak.

505
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.261
Listen, breeder,
not every gay man wants to have sex with you.

506
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:17.557
Yeah? Listen up, ass jockey.
If I were gay, you'd want me!

507
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.601
Really?
Really.

508
00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:24.022
I got style. I'm cultured.
I'm sophisticated.

509
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:28.234
And all that just radiates
from your oh-so-sexy self.

510
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:32.071
That's bullshit.
Everyone wants a piece of the Stifmeister.

511
00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.784
Yeah, right!

512
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.247
Without a doubt.

513
00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:44.250
I'll show you fuckers.
Bye.

514
00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:46.169
Everybody say bye.
Bye.

515
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:49.672
Bye.

516
00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:51.507
Good luck with the dress.

517
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.179
Give us a drink.

518
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:28.878
Mother of God.

519
00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:47.814
Bitch!

520
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.453
What is this, a dance-off?

521
00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:06.374
Oh, yeah?

522
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.424
I love you!

523
00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:40.134
What?

524
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:43.513
Fabulous. Seeing that
was worth anything.

525
00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:46.557
Look, I'm Leslie Summers and you've got yourself a dress.

526
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:51.938
Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you.

527
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.191
Yeah, no problem.
Say, who's your friend?

528
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.526
Kevin.

529
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.116
Was that the best
night ever or what?

530
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.284
Are you kidding me?

531
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.494
Yeah, it was amazing.

532
00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.995
Hey, guys!

533
00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:13.584
When you get your bachelor party together,
I manage some girls in town.

534
00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.044
Real ones.

535
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.212
All right.

536
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.006
Call me.

537
00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:21.759
Damn, Stiffy,
you got some moves.

538
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:30.309
I told you that guy
wanted to fuck me.

539
00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:35.314
I can't believe this.
They're really gonna make the dress for me?

540
00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:37.608
They're expecting your call.
Go ahead.

541
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.778
This is so cool.
I love you.

542
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.613
Thank you.

543
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:49.120
Well, that worked out.

544
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:53.499
Maybe it's time we had that special dinner chat.

545
00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:55.376
I'll have turkey.

546
00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:02.008
Thanks for helping out.

547
00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:04.844
We're so close and there's still so much to do.

548
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.056
Cadence!

549
00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:21.277
Hey!
Hi!

550
00:30:23.614 --> 00:30:27.575
Cadence, this is Paul Finch.
Finch, meet my younger sister, Cadence.

551
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:28.910
Nice to meet you.

552
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:30.328
You're reading Descartes.

553
00:30:30.704 --> 00:30:35.291
Yeah. Cogito ergo sum.
"I think, therefore I am."

554
00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:40.004
Hungry.

555
00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:44.425
So, when's Mark getting in?

556
00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:46.719
Let's see.
That would be never.

557
00:30:47.638 --> 00:30:48.888
Did you guys break up?

558
00:30:49.056 --> 00:30:50.306
How tragic.

559
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:53.392
Sorry, Paul Finch.
Girl stuff.

560
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:00.942
Just stay calm.

561
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:04.195
I'm available,
she's available. It's all good.

562
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.990
She's a beautiful girl,
and you're you.

563
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:10.701
Spill it, sister.
What's the problem?

564
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:12.036
I dumped him.

565
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:16.207
But it was Mark.
I thought you really liked him. He was nice.

566
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:20.586
Yeah, but sometimes
nice isn't so nice.

567
00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.547
Wait. Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

568
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:25.091
He didn't want to do it.

569
00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:27.093
He said he didn't
want to ruin what we had

570
00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:29.136
by deflowering ourselves.

571
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:31.514
Who the hell uses
the word "deflower"?

572
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:34.225
It's like
something Mom would say.

573
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:35.559
Yeah.

574
00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:39.271
And I'm starting to realize Mom and Dad's idea of appropriate behavior

575
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.233
might be a little bit
different than mine.

576
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.568
Mish, you're in love.
Shh.

577
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:46.946
You're getting married.
I mean, what's this like?

578
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:48.364
It's like it's...

579
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.825
I'm never going to
be able to explain it.

580
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:53.369
I wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding

581
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.162
and now I can't do mine.

582
00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:58.040
How do you explain love?

583
00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:01.252
I guess I wouldn't know.

584
00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:04.130
I don't think I've ever felt that way about a guy.

585
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:05.381
Someday you will.

586
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:06.674
Maybe.

587
00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:09.135
But in the meantime,
I don't think it would hurt

588
00:32:09.302 --> 00:32:11.178
to get a little
rowdy this weekend.

589
00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:15.016
Jim's got single friends, right?
Is Finch a possibility?

590
00:32:15.308 --> 00:32:16.767
Finch is bonable.

591
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:18.519
Yes, he is bonable.

592
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.153
Dickhead. Do not send shit
to my office at school.

593
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:29.947
Hey, Stifler,
why don't you come in and make yourself comfortable?

594
00:32:30.032 --> 00:32:31.407
Your letter made
a great impression

595
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:32.950
on Coach Marshall
when he read it.

596
00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:35.036
Let me refresh
your memory, partner.

597
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.872
"Dear Steve,
I will be forever in your debt if you teach me to dance

598
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.457
"like you did
in the gay bar."

599
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:41.375
I put serious thought
into that letter.

600
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.504
Don't push me,
'cause I'm close to the edge.

601
00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:48.257
I'm trying not
to lose my head.

602
00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:50.259
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

603
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:55.056
These are really
nice for a bridesmaid dress.

604
00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:58.184
At least something
you can actually wear again.

605
00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:01.270
You don't think
it's too sexy, do you?

606
00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:03.439
I mean, I don't want to seem
slutty or anything.

607
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.357
I'm trying to
attract a decent guy here.

608
00:33:05.776 --> 00:33:08.486
It's a wedding.
They'll all be decent guys.

609
00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:12.156
I just don't feel
quite like a virgin in it.

610
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.532
Oh!

611
00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:19.955
So, you guys have to be psyched to be done with college.

612
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.167
I mean, I swear,
I'm running out of room in my brain for everything.

613
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:26.295
There's always room
for Plato and Aristotle.

614
00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:28.339
Some of my favorites.

615
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.009
Excuse me, guys.

616
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:35.638
Finch, she thinks
you were being sarcastic.

617
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:38.474
Okay.
It's so good to see you.

618
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:42.228
You want some help?
Here, let me help you out there.

619
00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:45.773
There you go.
You keep fighting the good fight, sir.

620
00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:49.443
That's great.

621
00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:51.195
That was really
sweet of you.

622
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:52.613
Yeah.

623
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.699
I love old people, you know?

624
00:33:57.077 --> 00:34:00.037
Hey, I hate to be
nosy and impolite,

625
00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:02.164
but do you know Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty?

626
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.874
Yeah.
Are they here?

627
00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:05.751
Well, I'm Cadence,
Michelle's sister.

628
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:09.004
I had no idea. I'm their
good friend, Steven.

629
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.214
Nice to meet you.

630
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.507
Yeah, you, too.

631
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.676
Well, they're around town
doing some wedding stuff.

632
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.844
That's cool.

633
00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:17.805
But there's still a few of us in the other room if you want to join us.

634
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.598
I don't know.

635
00:34:19.933 --> 00:34:22.351
You look so nice.
I feel underdressed.

636
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.603
Well, I think you look great.

637
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:25.855
Thank you.

638
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:28.440
Oh, here they are.

639
00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:30.401
Hi, boys.
Don't stand up.

640
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:32.611
The dads aren't here yet?

641
00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:34.071
I'll go find them.

642
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.907
Which one of you
is the best man?

643
00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:40.953
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he couldn't decide.

644
00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:43.122
Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.

645
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.874
Mom,
I want you to meet Steven.

646
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:49.211
He's friends of Jim's and mine and everyone's.

647
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.839
You look
very familiar, Steven.

648
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:53.966
Really?
I'm afraid we've never met. Oh.

649
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.968
Well, we have now.

650
00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:57.136
Oh!

651
00:34:57.387 --> 00:35:00.306
Looks like you found Samantha's Sweets.
Oh!

652
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.975
Isn't their
chocolate just to die for?

653
00:35:03.185 --> 00:35:04.393
You have no idea.

654
00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:05.769
Actually, I do.

655
00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:07.146
I love chocolate
more than...

656
00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:08.647
More than life itself!

657
00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:10.983
I was just
saying to your friends

658
00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:13.736
I have something
very precious here.

659
00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:15.029
What is it?

660
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:19.491
Michelle's grandmother's,
my mother's, wedding ring.

661
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.619
Isn't that precious?

662
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.996
Since all of you
are the best man,

663
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:26.498
I don't know
who should hold onto it.

664
00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:27.875
I think it's best if I...

665
00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:28.959
Oh, um...

666
00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:33.672
I think you should get to know us first and then decide.

667
00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:37.051
You are such
a gentleman, Steve.

668
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:39.970
I hear that all the time,
but it never gets old.

669
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.139
Hey, Paul,
do you have a camera?

670
00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:44.016
How thoughtful.

671
00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:49.146
I must've forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

672
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:51.523
Maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

673
00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:54.652
I won't forget this moment.

674
00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:55.986
I'll bet you won't.

675
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:57.613
Would you care to
join us, Steven?

676
00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:59.281
I'd love to. Thank you.

677
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:00.824
Good to see you fellows.
Thank you.

678
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:10.459
Oh, amazing.

679
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.336
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

680
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.089
I love the way
the tulips accentuate the...

681
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.423
What do you call
those again, sir?

682
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:17.841
Double lisianthus.

683
00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:19.218
Lisianthus.

684
00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:20.719
Double lisianthums.

685
00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:22.888
What a pretty name.

686
00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:29.812
I told him to be nice,
or he couldn't come to the wedding.

687
00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:31.939
Okay, I will take care of this.
I will take care of this.

688
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.274
James. Great.
Come on over.

689
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.692
Great, come on over.

690
00:36:34.776 --> 00:36:37.278
You can see if I forgot anything.
I don't think I... Oh!

691
00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:39.029
We're having a great time.

692
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:41.448
I think I've got it all.
Look, look, look.

693
00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:44.410
Sahara and
desert rose for

694
00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:46.537
Your bridesmaids' bouquet.

695
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.706
Give me that. Smell this.

696
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.251
It's fantastic.
Fantastic. And... Oh!

697
00:36:58.341 --> 00:36:59.842
Look at this!

698
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.471
Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

699
00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:07.057
I think with
the summer blossoms...

700
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.642
Thank you for everything.

701
00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.060
What'd you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable?

702
00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:11.520
Bye, Cadence.

703
00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:14.773
Okay, I know what you're doing.
Look, have you seen yourself?

704
00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:16.442
I can't believe
you're doing this, Stifler.

705
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:18.235
Just calm down, dude.

706
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.903
It's all set.
What's set?

707
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:22.865
I'm gonna teach you to dance like a Baryshninikov.

708
00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:24.742
Oh, yeah.

709
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.160
He is pretty good.

710
00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.203
Jim, he's not
doing it to be nice.

711
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:29.788
He's doing it
to bone Cadence.

712
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:31.206
Look, maybe we should
give him a chance.

713
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.499
You know, I think

714
00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:36.462
that underneath all the "fucks" and "shits" and "blow me's"

715
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:38.589
there's a very
sensitive person

716
00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:40.674
who is just
thirsty for acceptance.

717
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:42.384
That's what I think.

718
00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:46.180
Oh, Jim, you've got
to stop masturbating.

719
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.306
It's melting your brain.

720
00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.100
Observe
the fucking Stifmeister.

721
00:37:50.226 --> 00:37:52.394
What is his
defining characteristic?

722
00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:56.523
He uses the "F"
word excessively.

723
00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:59.443
Thanks, man.
But I also have confidence.

724
00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.111
You're one big floppy cock.

725
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:04.031
Look at you.
You got to stand like a man.

726
00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.867
Your posture tells
your partner where to go.

727
00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:07.951
Okay?
Okay.

728
00:38:08.161 --> 00:38:09.787
Follow my lead.

729
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:12.623
This is the waltz.

730
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.333
Waltz? Okay.

731
00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:16.960
Waltz. Okay.

732
00:38:19.381 --> 00:38:20.839
That's pretty good.

733
00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:22.466
You're fucking right
it's good.

734
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.344
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

735
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:27.805
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

736
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:31.183
Should I shave my balls?
Do you shave your balls? How do you do it?

737
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.684
Dude! No.

738
00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:38.273
I'm just... Shaving...

739
00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.568
You know, there's
nothing like a local pub.

740
00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:43.404
Mmm-hmm.
It's like real America,

741
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.948
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles.

742
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:47.616
What's wrong
with a good jingle?

743
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.285
I think it was
Voltaire who said,

744
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:55.624
"A jingle witty proves everything for my friends and I."

745
00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:01.839
Cadence, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

746
00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:04.508
You're just in time for
Voltaire's greatest hits.

747
00:39:04.592 --> 00:39:07.594
Voltaire? Stifler, please,
who was Voltaire?

748
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:10.556
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

749
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.726
Actually, I'm getting a little burned out on all the intellectual stuff.

750
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.687
Yeah, me, too.

751
00:39:17.063 --> 00:39:18.605
Being smart is so hard.

752
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.653
I'll give you
some intelligence.

753
00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:28.449
Voltaire can suck
on my balls.

754
00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:31.660
What?

755
00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:34.413
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

756
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:36.582
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a quote to live by.

757
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.542
"Love life, get paid,
and then get laid."

758
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:42.087
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finchmeister.

759
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:43.630
I like that.

760
00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:44.756
Bet you do.

761
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:47.843
Really? I don't know
why you do,

762
00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:50.512
because Finchmeister doesn't make any frigging sense.

763
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:51.930
Sure it does.

764
00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.432
No fucking shit it does.

765
00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:59.521
Cadence, let's leave
the cray-ton here, shall we?

766
00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:01.773
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walking, anyway.

767
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:06.111
You know,
I think I'm gonna go stretch my legs with the Finchmeister.

768
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.446
You don't mind,
do you, Steven?

769
00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:08.864
No.

770
00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:12.659
Ha!

771
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.791
It's on like
Donkey Kong, bitch.

772
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.377
Pack it up, bitch.

773
00:40:22.504 --> 00:40:23.921
I'm on it. Thank you.

774
00:40:24.005 --> 00:40:27.466
So, Cadence say
anything about me?

775
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.969
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

776
00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:34.223
Finch. She gonna be around
tomorrow night?

777
00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:37.726
No, she's going up to Chicago with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

778
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.102
What about her parents?

779
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:41.730
I think her mom
kind of likes me.

780
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:45.400
They're going up north
with my parents

781
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:47.819
to get things ready
for the rehearsal.

782
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:49.655
So that's where they'll be.

783
00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:52.574
So don't bother looking for them or anything,
you know?

784
00:40:52.659 --> 00:40:54.910
A wedding. Shit.

785
00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:58.664
How do you know
she's the right girl?

786
00:40:58.748 --> 00:40:59.998
I just do.

787
00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:02.209
I'm a better person
when I'm with Michelle.

788
00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.086
Nobody else can...
No, shithead.

789
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.548
You hooked up with one other girl for what?
10 seconds?

790
00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:11.218
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fucking thing ever.

791
00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:13.971
You're like a blind man picking out his favorite porno.

792
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.847
That shit is crazy.

793
00:41:19.269 --> 00:41:21.603
This is just the old
pre-wedding jitters, Son.

794
00:41:21.688 --> 00:41:24.231
It's so forever.
You know, it's...

795
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:28.610
You know,
Michelle is the only girl that I've been with.

796
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.698
Honestly, now,
would you have passed up sex with Nadia?

797
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.368
Why? Did she say something?

798
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.954
Hypothetically, Dad.

799
00:41:39.038 --> 00:41:40.664
Hypothetically. Well,

800
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:42.791
you know, Jim,
I'm a married man.

801
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:44.668
If you weren't married.

802
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:46.461
She's a college girl.

803
00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:47.879
If you were a college guy.

804
00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:50.424
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

805
00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:53.176
First of all,
what you're feeling

806
00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:55.220
is so normal
and perfectly natural.

807
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.055
Marriage is not about

808
00:41:57.557 --> 00:42:00.309
animal lusting,
and kinky sex games.

809
00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:02.436
It's not so much about

810
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.647
who's the dog and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

811
00:42:05.732 --> 00:42:07.357
It's deeper than that.

812
00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:11.987
The longer a marriage lasts,
the longer you can go

813
00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.448
without sex.

814
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.950
But when that
magic night does happen,

815
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:19.870
it's all
the more meaningful.

816
00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:21.955
Let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

817
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:24.124
can still make me
squeal like a pig.

818
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:26.168
I mean that
in the good sense.

819
00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:27.586
Do you follow
what I'm saying?

820
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.421
You understand
where I'm going here?

821
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.340
I do. I think...

822
00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:32.466
Anything else you need?

823
00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:33.717
No. No. That's...

824
00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:37.929
Anything I can do.

825
00:42:57.075 --> 00:43:00.994
He's not here.
Park the cars down there where he won't see them.

826
00:43:07.335 --> 00:43:08.377
Whoo!

827
00:43:08.461 --> 00:43:10.087
Fucking right!

828
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:12.130
So, you like
my pants, Stiffy?

829
00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:14.216
Whatever, dude.
As long as the girls are worth it.

830
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.635
They're worth it. Oh!
And if you got good wine, too,

831
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:18.178
that'll score
points for you.

832
00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.971
I think there's
some in the basement.

833
00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:22.891
I'll get it. You ain't
gonna want to miss this.

834
00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:28.480
Gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

835
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:32.401
Officer Krystal
und Fräulein Brandi!

836
00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:35.404
Oh, my God.

837
00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:40.867
Oh, my God.

838
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:43.537
You boys have
been very messy.

839
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:49.126
Whoops.

840
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.794
Can you see my fanny?

841
00:43:50.878 --> 00:43:52.546
Whoops.

842
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:54.464
Oh!

843
00:43:58.344 --> 00:43:59.553
Oh!

844
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:01.763
Ow!

845
00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:03.849
You naughty girl.

846
00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.353
None of that
pleading the Fifth crap.

847
00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:09.855
You boys are gonna talk.

848
00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:13.400
Wow!

849
00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:16.153
Oh, my God!

850
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.115
Are you just gonna
stand there and drool?

851
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.366
Or we gonna have
a bachelor party?

852
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:22.617
Fuck, yeah, we are!

853
00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:23.702
Yeah?
Yeah.

854
00:44:23.786 --> 00:44:25.745
What? I can't hear you.

855
00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:27.247
Louder!

856
00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:28.874
Yes.

857
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.459
Bachelor party.

858
00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:31.793
I can't hear you. Louder!

859
00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:34.254
Stick a finger in my ass!

860
00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:39.009
That's weird.

861
00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:40.427
You just wait.

862
00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.762
Maybe we should
just wait for Jim.

863
00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:45.348
Fuck Jim, man!
This is for us!

864
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:46.516
Take her top off.

865
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:49.811
My girlfriend has strict rules about this.
No touching.

866
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.856
What are you,
a dancing clown?

867
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.568
You wipe that shit-eating grin off your face,
you punk-ass little bitch!

868
00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:57.944
This is awesome!

869
00:44:58.112 --> 00:44:59.529
You like that?
Like it? How much? No!

870
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:00.822
Yeah, I do.
Boob.

871
00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:04.159
Sorry.

872
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:07.454
No, not yet.
But you will be.

873
00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:10.665
Like I said,
this is awesome.

874
00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:20.509
Hey, listen,
I think we both know

875
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:24.513
that Officer Krystal and me
have this, you know...

876
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.972
Thing?
Yeah.

877
00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:36.733
No one has ever
slapped my ass like that.

878
00:45:37.193 --> 00:45:40.070
No one's ever pinched my nipple with such ferocity.

879
00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:49.704
I'm a master of
the Tantric art.

880
00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.916
I look at her
body and I just see

881
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.669
the chakras and the things
I could do to her and...

882
00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:11.351
You, you look cute.
Oh, thank you.

883
00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:13.603
You, you're the cute one.

884
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.647
Stiffy, how slimming is this?

885
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:19.025
What the fuck,
Buffalo Bill?

886
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:22.279
What? The pink too much?

887
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.533
It puts the dress in the drawer and does as it's told.

888
00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:30.203
Oh, dude,
now that's fucked up.

889
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:32.289
That's fucked up.

890
00:46:32.915 --> 00:46:35.458
And in closing,
you have been a naughty, naughty girl.

891
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:40.088
You been naughty, Brandi?
You been fucking naughty?

892
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:42.757
Fresh.

893
00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.552
Take her top off!

894
00:46:46.554 --> 00:46:49.222
Will you get to cleaning,
you little bitch fucker.

895
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:53.310
Do you want to
see us kiss?

896
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.480
Fuck, no!

897
00:46:57.773 --> 00:46:59.899
None of that "you go,
we go" bullshit.

898
00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:02.110
- We've already done that.
- Good of you.

899
00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:16.625
I used to have
this pet bass.

900
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:19.669
His name was Arnie,
and he was so cute

901
00:47:19.754 --> 00:47:22.964
and he just loved me, too,
you know. He would look at me...

902
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.174
Maybe you
could dance.

903
00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:25.717
...make this
face like...

904
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.428
Or something like that.
I don't know. It was great.

905
00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.221
I miss Arnie, but...

906
00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:32.515
Sometimes I watch
the Discovery Channel.

907
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.808
I love that show.

908
00:47:33.893 --> 00:47:35.268
I don't care!

909
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.480
Could you just
dance for me, please?

910
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:42.525
No, that's my favorite...
Well, was my favorite shirt.

911
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:44.277
Okay...

912
00:47:44.737 --> 00:47:45.737
Hey.

913
00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:47.864
What?

914
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.700
Nothing.

915
00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:53.828
It's a crazy party, huh?

916
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:06.716
You don't worry about him.
You don't worry about him.

917
00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:11.680
He's a maniac. You're a maniac,
you know that?

918
00:48:18.187 --> 00:48:21.439
Stifler, why in the world
are you focused on me?

919
00:48:21.524 --> 00:48:23.233
I'm just surprised to
see you don't have tits.

920
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:26.569
How can I clean you
if you are not dirty?

921
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:30.657
Go put something on that I must clean off with my tongue.

922
00:48:31.283 --> 00:48:32.283
Oh!

923
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.577
Anything for a French person.

924
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:36.871
If you insist, fräulein.

925
00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:50.427
Ah!

926
00:48:52.722 --> 00:48:54.848
Look at you,
you pathetic little weasel.

927
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:56.683
Can't I just watch?

928
00:48:57.518 --> 00:49:00.937
Look, you don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

929
00:49:01.021 --> 00:49:02.147
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

930
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:06.317
Hold on!
Don't break character ever again, okay?

931
00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:08.403
I don't care
if Kevin starts crying

932
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:09.946
because Finch
bit his cock off.

933
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.740
You're a dirty cop,
you're a prissy maid.

934
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.826
And I'm your filthy cabana boy in need of punishment and cleaning.

935
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:17.704
Don't you ever mouth
off to Officer Krystal,

936
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.539
you dirty little pervert!
Okay.

937
00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.541
Now obey!
I obey!

938
00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.877
Jesus.

939
00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:42.771
Hey, guys,
are we having dinner?

940
00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:49.778
Let me get that.

941
00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:54.073
Holy shit!

942
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200
Stifler.

943
00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:58.077
I've got something really nice
cooking up for you inside.

944
00:49:58.162 --> 00:49:59.370
Well, we love surprises.

945
00:49:59.455 --> 00:50:01.331
Stifler, you said
you spoke to Jim.

946
00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:03.082
I did. I was secret
about it and everything.

947
00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:04.834
He said he'd be
the only one here tonight.

948
00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:06.669
What the fuck,
Shitbreak?

949
00:50:06.754 --> 00:50:07.962
It's chocolate.

950
00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.758
I told everyone that you were up north with my parents.

951
00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:15.220
So we won't be bothered.
We can just totally relax. No worries.

952
00:50:17.056 --> 00:50:19.182
Please come on in.
Make yourselves at home. Right this way.

953
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.433
Thank you.

954
00:50:24.772 --> 00:50:25.772
What?

955
00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:27.857
Pink roses.

956
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.026
Pink roses.

957
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:32.904
They're nice, aren't they?

958
00:50:33.072 --> 00:50:34.614
Yes, artificial. Nice try.

959
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:38.034
I almost got you.

960
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:43.915
So, has Michelle ever told you the story of how we fell in love?

961
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.251
Why don't you retell us now?

962
00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:49.546
It's one of my favorite stories.
Where should I begin?

963
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:53.466
Let's see...

964
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:57.554
Well, I suppose it
all started at...

965
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:03.685
Tall Oaks.

966
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:07.105
That's right. At Tall Oaks.

967
00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:10.149
That was the summer
when... Oh!

968
00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:12.235
Oh! The summer
that was so hot!

969
00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.486
So hot.

970
00:51:13.612 --> 00:51:15.071
All right, look what I got.

971
00:51:15.197 --> 00:51:16.656
Jesus!

972
00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:18.199
Hey, there.

973
00:51:18.284 --> 00:51:19.284
Guy, there!

974
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.620
Jim, I cannot believe you.

975
00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:25.290
You can't?

976
00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:29.168
You hired help on our account.
That is entirely unnecessary.

977
00:51:29.378 --> 00:51:31.754
But I will have
some of that wine, sir.

978
00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:33.131
Say please, Harold.

979
00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:34.632
Please. Of course.

980
00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:36.718
Absolutely.

981
00:51:36.844 --> 00:51:37.844
It's what he's here for.

982
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.429
The wine. Obviously.

983
00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:40.805
Evidently.

984
00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:42.181
What else would
you be here for?

985
00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:46.477
And I certainly appreciate
your courtesy, sir.

986
00:51:49.523 --> 00:51:51.482
Yes, we have right here

987
00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:56.321
a 1999 Cabernet Say-vun-nun.

988
00:51:57.573 --> 00:52:00.950
Full-bodied, masculine wine.

989
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:03.828
Just shouts sophistication.

990
00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:07.290
James?
Yes?

991
00:52:07.374 --> 00:52:10.710
I can see you're very surprised to see me here.

992
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.045
Little bit.

993
00:52:12.212 --> 00:52:13.463
I'm going to go
check on the dogs.

994
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:17.091
Yes!
In fact why don't you both go check on the dogs and...

995
00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:20.553
No! Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

996
00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.013
How do you know?

997
00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.514
Because I just
checked on the dogs.

998
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.308
Because he checked on the dogs.
I did.

999
00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:26.559
Good work, man.

1000
00:52:26.685 --> 00:52:27.852
Jim, I'll help
you with the turkey.

1001
00:52:27.937 --> 00:52:29.687
Okay.

1002
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.564
And I'll keep
you company.

1003
00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:33.066
Thank you.

1004
00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:37.070
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mister...

1005
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:38.196
Belvedere, ma'am.

1006
00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:39.364
Belvedere.

1007
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:42.617
It's chilly in here.

1008
00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:45.411
So, how long do we
have to stay in here for?

1009
00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:48.081
I don't know.
They said to hide.

1010
00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:50.166
I guess we'll just
wait for them to call us.

1011
00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:53.127
Who knows what kind of kinky shit they're getting ready for.

1012
00:52:53.212 --> 00:52:55.505
Do these go in your
ass tonight, or mine?

1013
00:52:59.093 --> 00:53:01.427
You have
a serving dish ready?

1014
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:04.097
Jim, we need a serving dish.
Hmm?

1015
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.932
Oh! Yeah, of course.

1016
00:53:06.558 --> 00:53:07.600
Oh!

1017
00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.143
What?

1018
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:11.646
Nothing.

1019
00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:13.648
Then why the excitement?

1020
00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:15.733
I thought the dish
was broken.

1021
00:53:16.068 --> 00:53:17.860
Well, is it?
No.

1022
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:19.696
Then are you going to get it?
Yes.

1023
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.042
Here you go.
One serving dish.

1024
00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:34.961
Excellent. Now what we need:

1025
00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.379
A cutting board.

1026
00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:37.463
No, stop!

1027
00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:38.548
What?

1028
00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:39.841
I will get it for you.

1029
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:42.176
Nonsense,
I can get a cutting board.

1030
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:46.806
Let's see, there you go.
This should do nicely.

1031
00:53:47.307 --> 00:53:49.892
I presume we're having white wine with the turkey.

1032
00:53:50.644 --> 00:53:52.437
Let me go check.

1033
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.693
What happened here?

1034
00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:00.653
Oh, um...

1035
00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:04.574
That's mud.
I meant to clean that up this morning.

1036
00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:06.117
How embarrassing.

1037
00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:08.619
That's gonna stain.
We're gonna need a mop.

1038
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:10.079
I'll get it.
It's in this closet.

1039
00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:11.581
No.

1040
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:13.875
No, it's not.

1041
00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:15.126
It's in there.

1042
00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:16.419
It's not in this closet,

1043
00:54:16.503 --> 00:54:19.922
because I moved it.

1044
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:22.300
Where? I'll go get it.

1045
00:54:22.468 --> 00:54:24.051
I don't remember.

1046
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.512
You don't remember?

1047
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:27.972
You know why
I don't remember

1048
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:29.891
is because I actually
did not move it.

1049
00:54:29.975 --> 00:54:31.851
The cleaning lady did.

1050
00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:34.228
Your mother said you don't have a cleaning lady.

1051
00:54:34.313 --> 00:54:36.439
I don't know why
she would say such a...

1052
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:37.648
You called, master?

1053
00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:38.858
Holy...

1054
00:54:39.693 --> 00:54:41.110
Well, there you are. Hello.

1055
00:54:41.236 --> 00:54:42.403
How do you do?

1056
00:54:43.822 --> 00:54:44.822
Uh...

1057
00:54:44.907 --> 00:54:49.535
So, cleaning lady,
we were wondering where the mop was.

1058
00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:52.872
Master put
the mop in my fanny.

1059
00:54:53.499 --> 00:54:55.458
You what?
Who put what where?

1060
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:57.835
I did no such thing anywhere.

1061
00:54:58.629 --> 00:55:00.171
Shall I clean?

1062
00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:04.842
Harold!

1063
00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:10.515
Very well.
It is so hot in here!

1064
00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:14.602
Holy Jesus!

1065
00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.734
Brandi, Brandi,
what are you doing?

1066
00:55:21.902 --> 00:55:23.653
You're not in
Eastern Europe anymore.

1067
00:55:23.737 --> 00:55:27.532
You can't do that.
I am so sorry about my cousin.

1068
00:55:27.616 --> 00:55:29.367
She's not used to
our customs.

1069
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:32.453
Jim, I apologize
for recommending her to you.

1070
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.456
Here's this, by the way.

1071
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:36.624
Ah!

1072
00:55:37.084 --> 00:55:38.459
Got the mop.

1073
00:55:38.544 --> 00:55:41.671
Brandi, you left the mop in the car.

1074
00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:43.673
Now remember,
it's called a car,

1075
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:45.091
not a fanny.

1076
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.343
Remember last time
when you wanted me

1077
00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:49.679
to take a ride
in your fanny.

1078
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:52.765
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.

1079
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.309
You know what?
We should probably just go.

1080
00:55:55.394 --> 00:55:57.186
I'm so sorry about this.

1081
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.188
I came by to make sure everything was in order.

1082
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:01.274
The food smells great.

1083
00:56:01.608 --> 00:56:03.276
Au revoir.

1084
00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:06.571
Jim, you have
unique friends.

1085
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:08.573
Harold!

1086
00:56:08.907 --> 00:56:11.284
Let's get that
cleaned up.

1087
00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:13.870
I think I saw some
Pine-Sol in here, too.

1088
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.164
My gosh!
Baby, Mary and Joseph.

1089
00:56:17.249 --> 00:56:18.416
Oh, my Lord!

1090
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:20.042
He's okay.

1091
00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:21.544
Are you all right?

1092
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:22.795
Who did this to you?

1093
00:56:22.921 --> 00:56:24.088
I'm sure he's okay.
You okay?

1094
00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:27.466
Get some help!
Harold, call the police!

1095
00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:29.844
All right!

1096
00:56:29.928 --> 00:56:31.053
Jesus.

1097
00:56:31.138 --> 00:56:32.305
I'll take charge
from here!

1098
00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.974
My God, they are fast here.
And nicely attired.

1099
00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.434
What's going on here?

1100
00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:38.060
She's here to
protect and serve.

1101
00:56:38.145 --> 00:56:39.312
Quiet!
Okay.

1102
00:56:39.396 --> 00:56:40.730
Who let this boy
out of the closet?

1103
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.316
You are all in for
a hard punishment now.

1104
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.276
Don't you touch him!
He's been hurt.

1105
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:47.111
No. This is hurt!

1106
00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:48.654
You can't do that.

1107
00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.489
Silence, fucker!
Ow!

1108
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:51.741
You like it.

1109
00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:52.825
Oh!

1110
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.994
Harold,
what's gotten into you?

1111
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.203
I meant... Ow!

1112
00:56:56.288 --> 00:56:58.831
Dirty whore.
Shut your hole. Obey!

1113
00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:01.876
You can't do that.

1114
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.169
You're a disgrace
to the police force.

1115
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:04.921
I'll be giving you
an enema!

1116
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.756
Hey, somebody untie me!

1117
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.882
Wait, not the face.
Back off!

1118
00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:10.217
All right, forget it.
We give up.

1119
00:57:10.302 --> 00:57:11.761
Steven!

1120
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.179
It's okay, Mary.

1121
00:57:13.305 --> 00:57:14.680
What's going on?

1122
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.433
Listen,
this isn't working, guys.

1123
00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:20.269
Krystal, you can drop the act.
This isn't a real cop.

1124
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:23.022
Kevin wasn't assaulted.

1125
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:25.608
I just wanted to make Jim look good for you guys.

1126
00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:27.151
Like a real hero.

1127
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.402
Kind of like me.

1128
00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:31.781
We hired a fake cop, tied up Kevin,
and put him in the closet.

1129
00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:34.533
Jim was supposed to rescue him,
untie him, give him mouth-to-mouth.

1130
00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.577
I don't know
what he likes to do.

1131
00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:39.872
Then Paul Finch hired an exotic dancer instead of a real actor.

1132
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.124
Jim, is this true?

1133
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:45.836
Every word of it.

1134
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:48.089
That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

1135
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:51.801
You've embarrassed me, Harold,
and Mr. Belvedere.

1136
00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:53.719
What?

1137
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.179
It's all my fault.
I'm a bad person.

1138
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:57.723
Oh! You're not a bad person.

1139
00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:00.810
You were just trying to help out your best friend.

1140
00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:04.814
It was an awful idea,
but I suppose it's the thought that counts.

1141
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:07.692
You know, actually,

1142
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:13.072
I never should have allowed

1143
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:16.701
such a crazy plan to
happen in the first place.

1144
00:58:16.785 --> 00:58:20.246
If you're gonna
blame anybody here,

1145
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.747
blame me.

1146
00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:23.165
I'm sorry, Jim.
I didn't realize

1147
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:24.709
how much pressure
we put on you.

1148
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.838
I'm sure you both learned your lesson,
and I suppose I understand.

1149
00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:31.841
Jim, if you put half as much energy into your marriage

1150
00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:34.760
as you put into tonight,
I'm confident that I can give you my blessing.

1151
00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:41.183
And, Steven,
we still adore you, honey.

1152
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:44.729
In fact, I think I know
who should hold onto this.

1153
00:58:44.813 --> 00:58:47.565
We adore you.
You'll take good care of it.

1154
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:48.858
You've got to
be kidding me.

1155
00:58:48.984 --> 00:58:50.192
No.

1156
00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:54.113
Lookit, Jim, Kevin.
Boy, this really makes me important to the wedding.

1157
00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:55.614
Yes.

1158
00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:01.037
Well, Mr.
Belvedere, it's gonna be one fucked-up wedding.

1159
00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:03.080
Absolutely.

1160
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:06.709
Drive carefully.
More bags in the study.

1161
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:07.877
Thank you.

1162
00:59:08.003 --> 00:59:09.128
You're welcome.

1163
00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.842
Ow!

1164
00:59:14.926 --> 00:59:16.302
Is there
any room for me?

1165
00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.803
Nope.

1166
00:59:18.513 --> 00:59:20.806
I'll just drive up
north all by myself.

1167
00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:23.100
That sounds good.
We'll see you later.

1168
00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.144
No, I'll drive with you.

1169
00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:28.606
Thanks, Cadence.
Beautiful lady.

1170
00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:35.780
Hey... I know. Shut up.
Kevin!

1171
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:48.084
So, my mom found
the dogs playing

1172
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.086
with something
unusual this morning.

1173
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:51.754
What?

1174
00:59:51.838 --> 00:59:53.589
I told her it was
a neck massager.

1175
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:57.927
These are great.

1176
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.202
He's hilarious.

1177
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.411
Yes.

1178
01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:28.666
That kind of thing
is so lethargic to me.

1179
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:31.752
What do you mean?

1180
01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.045
I'm not sure.

1181
01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:56.152
Mr.
Stifler, I already told you you called two days ago

1182
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:58.070
and canceled
your reservation.

1183
01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.989
Since you now
wish to stay here,

1184
01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.700
I thought you could persuade
Mr. Finch to share his room.

1185
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.452
Hey, Shithead, I didn't
cancel my reservation.

1186
01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.496
Mr. Fuckface Finch
called here.

1187
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.124
And Mr. Idiot Behind
the Desk canceled it.

1188
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:14.044
Christof, please pardon
my friend's uncouth behavior.

1189
01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.505
I did no such thing.

1190
01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:18.382
Nor did I, sir.

1191
01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:22.428
And your rudeness and obscenities won't change anything.

1192
01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:25.848
Well then,
I guess it doesn't matter if I call you a crotchface,

1193
01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.349
you ball-scratching fucker.

1194
01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.185
Or better yet,
go blow your dad.

1195
01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.020
My dad?
Hear, hear.

1196
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.856
While you're there,
stick a finger up both their asses

1197
01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.941
while you're down there.

1198
01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:40.529
Finch, rudeness and obscenity
won't change anything.

1199
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:44.116
Grow a sack,
fill it with some balls,

1200
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.869
magically sprout a dick,
shove it up your ass,

1201
01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:49.788
and start fucking yourself
like, "Yeah, baby!"

1202
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.626
You going
with what I'm saying?

1203
01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.295
This is disgusting.

1204
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.798
Why don't you go dust with your perverse European cousin?

1205
01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:01.675
Is she here?

1206
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.302
Unbelievable.

1207
01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.055
I'd like to book
a tee time for my husband

1208
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.141
and a European pumpkin peel facial for me, please.

1209
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.643
Make that two.

1210
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.770
You'll have
a fun weekend, Ma.

1211
01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.563
I am missing my soap.

1212
01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:16.357
Don't you worry
about your soaps.

1213
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.525
Will you push faster?
I'm tired.

1214
01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.819
And wait till
you meet Michelle.

1215
01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.905
You're gonna love her.
She's sweet as sugar.

1216
01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.448
I can't eat sugar.

1217
01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.242
I know,
because you're diabetic.

1218
01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.160
You know, Ma,

1219
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.580
I know things haven't been going well for you.
I know that.

1220
01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:35.417
But wait till you see Jim standing up there at the altar tomorrow.

1221
01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:39.421
If ever there was a time to be happy and smile the biggest smile,

1222
01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:40.839
now is the time.

1223
01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:44.718
Okay, okay. I'm overjoyed.

1224
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.680
That's a start.

1225
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.642
Proud grandmother
coming through.

1226
01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.353
Grandson's getting
married tomorrow.

1227
01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.022
You think she's happy now,
wait till tomorrow.

1228
01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.442
"Congratulations."

1229
01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.077
"Grooming."

1230
01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.529
You got bigger.

1231
01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.916
The flowers stay refrigerated until morning...

1232
01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.710
Oh! I'm sure they will.

1233
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.128
They're so pretty...

1234
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.601
Oh, Jimmy, no!

1235
01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1236
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.406
I hope you'll be more careful with the next one.

1237
01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.992
My kitchen is
not a toilet, okay?

1238
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:43.337
Boy, pubic hair was just not
an issue when I was dating.

1239
01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.591
The ladies never complained

1240
01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.302
when they were, you know,
down in that general area...

1241
01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.889
Okay, if you never mention that ever again,
that'd be great.

1242
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.016
Shouldn't have brought it up.

1243
01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.394
So, can I see the ring?

1244
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.604
Nope. I promised
to keep it safe.

1245
01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.898
It's not leaving my pocket.

1246
01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.525
Okay, Frodo.

1247
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.572
You really care about this wedding,
don't you?

1248
01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:15.077
I'm gonna cry at the ceremony.
I know it.

1249
01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.748
Are you just saying
all of this?

1250
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.710
I mean,
do you act differently around certain people?

1251
01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.587
Namely me?

1252
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.425
Of course not. Why?
Do you act differently around me?

1253
01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.929
Generally, I'm just me.
If people don't like it, that's their problem.

1254
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.556
Yeah. Fuck those fuckers.

1255
01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.141
What?

1256
01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:39.935
I didn't...

1257
01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.603
No, you're right. Fuck 'em.

1258
01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.944
Hey, Harold and Mary!

1259
01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.779
Hi, kids.

1260
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.115
How's it going?

1261
01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.368
Come on. Thanks for
watching the dogs.

1262
01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:59.580
I love these guys. Hey, guys,
want more Snausages? Huh?

1263
01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.790
There you go.

1264
01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.500
Eat 'em up.
Give me some.

1265
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.877
There you go.

1266
01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.130
I don't think
I have any left.

1267
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.632
What's wrong?

1268
01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.925
Shit.

1269
01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.969
Are you okay?

1270
01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.307
Yeah.

1271
01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.978
You kissed Stifler?

1272
01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.646
Yeah. But then he freaked.

1273
01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.816
It's like he's been paying more attention to the dogs than me.

1274
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.526
Can I stop worrying then?

1275
01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.070
Michelle, he's been
nothing but nice to me.

1276
01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.990
I mean, do you think
he really likes you?

1277
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:39.786
I don't know. I hope he likes me.
I mean, I think he likes me.

1278
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.208
Yeah, I guess
I hope he likes me.

1279
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.837
Do it.

1280
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.842
Don't fuck around.
Just relax and let it go.

1281
01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.179
I'm sick of waiting.

1282
01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.348
Do it for Daddy.

1283
01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.392
Will you just
take a shit already?

1284
01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:04.937
Great.

1285
01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:08.315
You fed the ring to the dogs,
didn't you?

1286
01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:14.279
Of course not!

1287
01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:17.616
You have been staring at those dogs like a hawk all day.

1288
01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.409
I'm a dog lover.

1289
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:24.915
By the way,
apparently you missed when Cadence kissed me.

1290
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:30.170
Slight tongue action, too.
It was something like this.

1291
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.715
You're a terrible liar,
Stifler.

1292
01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.927
If I were lying,
I'd think of something better than a kiss.

1293
01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.471
Maybe a blow job
or some tittie grabbing.

1294
01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.432
No pussy for you, Finch.

1295
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:48.146
Fucking right, doggy!
It's about goddamn time!

1296
01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.107
Jackpot!

1297
01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:53.860
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some shit to attend to.

1298
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:15.716
Thanks, assholes.

1299
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.884
Yeah,
maybe you can call him.

1300
01:08:17.969 --> 01:08:18.969
Okay.

1301
01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:21.221
Steve, come over here.

1302
01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:25.225
Uh...

1303
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.935
I'm a little busy.

1304
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.354
With what? Come on over.
We need you.

1305
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.023
Get over here,
you little rascal.

1306
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:34.693
We were talking about Michelle's wedding band.
Could I see it?

1307
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.278
Um...

1308
01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:39.072
No.
No?

1309
01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.908
I don't have it.
What?

1310
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:43.285
You mean you lost it?

1311
01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.703
Of course not.

1312
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:47.289
I'm keeping it safe in my room,
you silly Sally!

1313
01:08:47.373 --> 01:08:48.874
Thank goodness.
I apologize.

1314
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.417
That's fine.
I'll see it later.

1315
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:52.002
Okay. All right, then.

1316
01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.795
What do you have
in your hand?

1317
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.133
This one?

1318
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.136
No, the other one.

1319
01:09:03.056 --> 01:09:05.140
It's a chocolate truffle.

1320
01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.433
Ooo! Yummy.

1321
01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:07.851
Where did you get that?

1322
01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:12.731
The caterer said she was saving the truffles for tomorrow.

1323
01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.649
You sneaky devil.

1324
01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.571
Well, hey,
I managed to sneak one right past her.

1325
01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.823
Come on,
this woman loves chocolate.

1326
01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:23.158
At least give
her a tiny nibble.

1327
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:24.576
Give it to Momma.

1328
01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.996
Momma don't want this.
This is the only piece that I have.

1329
01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:29.081
Idiot.

1330
01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:30.499
Break it in half.
Come on.

1331
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.917
You know what?

1332
01:09:32.043 --> 01:09:34.169
Let's just leave
the surprises till tomorrow.

1333
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:35.420
It's gonna be a great day.

1334
01:09:35.588 --> 01:09:36.755
I'd like
my surprise right now.

1335
01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.548
No, it's mine.
Come on!

1336
01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:40.926
Give it to me.
No.

1337
01:09:41.052 --> 01:09:42.761
Give the darn truffle.

1338
01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.599
Steven,
that is so selfish.

1339
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:49.559
It's good.

1340
01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:50.977
Is it? Is it sweet?

1341
01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:54.272
It's so sweet.

1342
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.945
Close your mouth
when you chew, Steven.

1343
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.113
Don't do that.

1344
01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:05.117
At least you could describe to the lovely woman how delicious it is.

1345
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.788
Well, tastes like twigs
and berries.

1346
01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.748
Is it Swiss or
French chocolate?

1347
01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.708
Maybe German.

1348
01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.378
Really? Is it creamy?

1349
01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:18.797
Yeah, it's creamy.

1350
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.132
Easy to go down, right?

1351
01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.801
Well, I'm trying to
savor the flavor right now.

1352
01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.302
Is it fresh?

1353
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.637
It's so fresh.

1354
01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.222
Nothing better than
when they're fresh.

1355
01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:28.807
Nothing better.

1356
01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.309
The problem is you can't eat just one,
can you?

1357
01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:32.811
No, you can't.

1358
01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.397
But you've got to know when to stop,
don't you?

1359
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.816
You really do, but it's hard.
It's really hard.

1360
01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.985
Droppings
from the gods.

1361
01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.821
Get me another one, darling.
Come on.

1362
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.574
You selfish boy. Next time,
bring enough for everybody.

1363
01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.243
Let's keep this to ourselves?
Okay?

1364
01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.453
Okay.

1365
01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:50.745
I gotta go, okay.

1366
01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.832
Don't have any more,
because it's gonna spoil your appetite.

1367
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.960
Okay.
Hey, look, man, I gotta go.

1368
01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.595
Grandma, I want you
to meet some people.

1369
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.932
Grandma, this is Michelle.

1370
01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.602
I'm so proud to be
joining your family.

1371
01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.729
She's real pretty, huh?

1372
01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:20.442
Isn't it great?
We're getting married.

1373
01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.569
It's amazing, Gram.

1374
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.992
Not Jewish! No wedding, Jimmy!
No wedding.

1375
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.161
Forget it.
Grandma.

1376
01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:32.329
A goyeh!

1377
01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:33.538
Shit.

1378
01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.789
Jim, she hates me.

1379
01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.084
Oh, my God!

1380
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.504
Grandma, look,
we love each other.

1381
01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.672
Michelle and I
love each other very much.

1382
01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.883
That's all that matters.
Grandma? Grandma?

1383
01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.637
Michelle? Michelle?

1384
01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.600
- But Grandma's okay?
- Oh, she's okay.

1385
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.937
Oh, yeah, Dad. She's okay.
She's just a little tired.

1386
01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:00.815
My mother hasn't been well.
She's been feeling...

1387
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.443
When your dad sees the look
on Grandma's face,

1388
01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.571
it's gonna break his heart.
Because of me.

1389
01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:10.825
It's not because of you.
Michelle, it's not because of you at all.

1390
01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.995
It's because
Grandma thinks it's 1801.

1391
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.791
Look, don't worry.
I'll come up with something.

1392
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.877
I promised you
the wedding of your dreams

1393
01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.255
and I'm not gonna
let anything ruin it.

1394
01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:25.966
Oh!

1395
01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:28.760
I would like to
propose a toast.

1396
01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:31.096
These last few weeks
have really been something

1397
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.764
for my lovely wife and me.

1398
01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:36.101
We have met some people
we didn't know existed.

1399
01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.604
We've experienced some things we didn't think were possible.

1400
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.816
We've always tried to make
the best of every situation.

1401
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.693
This is a good situation.

1402
01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.821
That's what I'm saying.
This is a wonderful situation.

1403
01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:51.992
The coming together of two families from different backgrounds.

1404
01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:55.745
So to our new son-in-law,
may we say Éireann go Bráugh.

1405
01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:59.124
And to our lovely daughter Michelle, L'Chaim.

1406
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.042
Did I get that right?
Very good.

1407
01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:04.629
And let's hope we can sit many happy shivas together.

1408
01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.341
Here's to
a wonderful wedding.

1409
01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.010
Cheers.
Cheers.

1410
01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.393
See that, Shitbreak?
I told you I won.

1411
01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.188
Hey.
Hey.

1412
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:28.320
I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I freaked
you out with the whole kiss thing.

1413
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.530
You didn't freak me out.

1414
01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:33.283
I just wanted to
let you know that

1415
01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.161
you make me feel special.

1416
01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.582
I think you're the most special girl I've ever known.

1417
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:45.211
Maybe you'd want to make things extra special tonight.

1418
01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:48.089
Which room is yours?

1419
01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.383
I'm crashing at Kevin's.

1420
01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:51.718
Damn.

1421
01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:52.969
But I saw

1422
01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:56.765
a big,
fluffy linen closet at the end of the main hallway.

1423
01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:58.475
Yes. Big,
fluffy linen closet is good.

1424
01:13:58.601 --> 01:13:59.643
Okay.

1425
01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.935
Midnight?
Yeah.

1426
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.395
All right.
Okay.

1427
01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:03.730
Oh!

1428
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:08.234
I'm going to
have-a sex-a with-a Cadence

1429
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.904
I'm going to have-a
sex-a with-a Cadence

1430
01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.322
Whoo!

1431
01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:19.454
Jesus! You fucking stalker!

1432
01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.290
You're not
a very stealthy thief.

1433
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.417
Really?
Guess what, Shitbreak?

1434
01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.419
It's a wedding.
Everything's free.

1435
01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.254
What do you want?

1436
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.759
Stifler, Jim's grandma doesn't approve of the wedding.

1437
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.637
We're trying to
run interference,

1438
01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.599
and, reluctantly,
I am asking for your help.

1439
01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:42.769
Sorry, Finchmeister,
I got plans with Cadence.

1440
01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:47.065
Stifler, maybe you could forget about your dick for one second

1441
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.942
and actually be useful.

1442
01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:53.655
Fuck you, Finch.
You didn't eat shit, okay?

1443
01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.658
You didn't prance around like a ballerina for the whole week.

1444
01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:59.869
Wedding this, suck my ass that.
I'm special, you're special.

1445
01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.372
We're all just a bunch of special fuckers,
aren't we?

1446
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:05.750
You know what?
I'm-a gonna get laid, Finchfucker.

1447
01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.711
And it's gonna be oh-so-good.

1448
01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.254
It's gonna be like,
"You like this shit, momma?"

1449
01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.173
She's gonna be like,
"Fucking right, doggy. Give it to me!

1450
01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.009
"Suck on my nipples
like you're milking a cow."

1451
01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.511
Like...

1452
01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:28.898
You been here long?

1453
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:31.901
Oh, shit.

1454
01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:36.156
Yeah...

1455
01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:40.243
Cadence, it is my distinct pleasure to introduce you

1456
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.538
to the real Steve Stifler.

1457
01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.332
Hi.

1458
01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.545
Pumpkin.

1459
01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:57.218
You are quite
the gentleman, Stifler.

1460
01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.012
You could've told
me she was behind me.

1461
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.475
Between Grandma, Stifler,
and Cadence... The cake.

1462
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.643
I mean, are you kidding me?

1463
01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:09.731
You know,
I thought I had grown out of this sort of behavior.

1464
01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:14.110
But I keep messing up.
These things keep happening to me.

1465
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.529
If I can't bring it
together for one day,

1466
01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:19.699
how am I gonna hold it together for the rest of our lives?

1467
01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:22.368
I'm really afraid this is how it's always gonna be.

1468
01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:25.872
Yeah, but you always manage to get yourself into serious shit,

1469
01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:29.042
and somehow you always come out of it better than you went in.

1470
01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.502
I don't know how,
but you do.

1471
01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.295
Everything is gonna be fine.

1472
01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:33.379
Yeah...

1473
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.510
You need to come into the kitchen right now.
There's... Yeah.

1474
01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:40.386
Jesus, now what?

1475
01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.562
There is no way to remake
all these in time, is there?

1476
01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.815
Something must have
disrupted the power.

1477
01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.317
The compressors need time
to reset after a power loss

1478
01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:55.652
or they overheat.

1479
01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:58.738
Essentially, it turns the refrigerator into an oven.

1480
01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:01.533
Stifler was in here
earlier flipping switches.

1481
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.161
Michelle, I am so sorry.

1482
01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:09.499
Hey.

1483
01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.380
Those flowers look hideous.

1484
01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.006
That's 'cause you
killed them, Stifler.

1485
01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.175
You've ruined everything.

1486
01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:23.221
What are you talking about?

1487
01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:27.058
You obviously don't care about this wedding,
or anyone in it.

1488
01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:30.436
Cadence...

1489
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.358
Jim?

1490
01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.572
Shitbreak, come on.

1491
01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:49.247
Maybe you should
just leave, Stifler.

1492
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.587
Fine. Adiós.

1493
01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.490
Fuckers!
It's not my fault!

1494
01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.452
I'm not an electrical
Einstein. I'm not...

1495
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.081
Damn it.

1496
01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:18.920
Fuck!

1497
01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.307
Hey, flower fuckers,
you there?

1498
01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:34.727
"Zyskowski."

1499
01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.742
Hello? Are you awake?

1500
01:19:50.369 --> 01:19:53.413
Shit. Come on.
Come on. Anybody awake?

1501
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:54.914
Oh!

1502
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:57.959
Are you Ms. Zyskowski?

1503
01:19:58.085 --> 01:19:59.377
Who are you?

1504
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.587
I'm the guy who just
killed all the flowers

1505
01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.923
for the Levenstein-Band
Geek wedding.

1506
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.174
What?

1507
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.467
Yeah, I'm that guy.

1508
01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:08.177
Now, what I need you to do

1509
01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.722
is drag your ass down
to your little store,

1510
01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.557
gather up some flowers,
slice them,

1511
01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:14.434
dice them,
jam them all together,

1512
01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.602
and cart that crap
down to the wedding.

1513
01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.813
Are you completely insane?

1514
01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:20.857
You have no idea.

1515
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.567
Even if I
overlooked the fact

1516
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:25.194
that this is the rudest thing
I have ever encountered,

1517
01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:27.780
there is no time to
redo all that work.

1518
01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:31.159
I had four assistants working two full days on that wedding.

1519
01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:34.370
I'm sorry. It's impossible.

1520
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.588
We don't quit
at halftime, ma'am!

1521
01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:46.132
You don't score
until you score!

1522
01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.139
That's the spirit,
sweetheart.

1523
01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:05.485
Come on.
Fuck the pain.

1524
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.820
You guys keep
working this hard,

1525
01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:09.530
we'll be able to
beat the Wildcats.

1526
01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:10.990
You remember how tough
they were last year.

1527
01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:14.410
Come on. Let's see
some determination.

1528
01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:16.913
Determination!

1529
01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:20.249
Hold the vase. That's it!

1530
01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:24.087
Come on.
Come on, keep working!

1531
01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.093
Good, Connor. Very good.

1532
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:33.096
Good, DeBoer.
It really sucks. Go fix it.

1533
01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:37.225
Hey, party guy, having a good time?
Can I get you a gin and tonic?

1534
01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:41.437
Hold on a second.
Hello? Okay. It's for you.

1535
01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:43.272
It's get to work, fucker.

1536
01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.650
We are gathered here today

1537
01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:48.653
to join these two great people in a blessed union

1538
01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.863
and blah-da-blah-da-blah and crap.

1539
01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.157
Coach? This is kind of gay.

1540
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.994
Yeah, it is.

1541
01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.289
Good work.

1542
01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:01.666
Hey, no problem.

1543
01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.169
So, you got
a date for this thing?

1544
01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.546
Don't push it.
Sorry.

1545
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.386
Holy shit.

1546
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.805
How the hell did this happen?

1547
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.390
It's a miracle.

1548
01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.767
Stifler.

1549
01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:21.102
Save it, dickhead.
I'm working.

1550
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:33.239
You're an asshole.

1551
01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:34.657
I know.

1552
01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:37.243
You really are an asshole.

1553
01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:39.120
Thanks.

1554
01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:44.709
I don't do apologies
so good.

1555
01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.546
Well, you get an "A" for effort.
This is amazing.

1556
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.050
Cool. I was always
kind of a "C" student.

1557
01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.721
So did you do all this
just to have sex with me

1558
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:59.307
or because you really care
about the wedding?

1559
01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:00.558
Both.

1560
01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.769
And...

1561
01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.273
I really like you.

1562
01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:08.691
What?

1563
01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.737
I like you.

1564
01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.363
That's an honest answer.

1565
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.699
I gotta go.

1566
01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:26.709
Steve Stifler just gave a rose to a girl,
and meant it.

1567
01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.502
This is huge.

1568
01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:32.256
It's like watching monkeys
use tools for the first time.

1569
01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.092
Are you still pissed
about me and Cadence?

1570
01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.719
No, let's see,

1571
01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:39.347
she wasn't into the heavy intellectual stuff.

1572
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.058
She actually liked me
being that imbecile.

1573
01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.603
No.
Somehow, I think she's probably better off with you.

1574
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.231
Thanks, Shitbreak.

1575
01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:55.446
Dick. I fucking
hate not hating you.

1576
01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:01.661
I did fuck your mom.

1577
01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:04.956
Twice.

1578
01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:08.125
That's better, fucker!

1579
01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:12.213
Oh. Whoa!

1580
01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:14.465
Ready to go?

1581
01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:15.633
Um...

1582
01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.343
The wedding's not
for another hour.

1583
01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.095
No, I mean you and me.

1584
01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:21.639
Hold on.

1585
01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.849
Do I still got to do
this bullshit meeting?

1586
01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.102
Stifler, you are not
bailing on Jim.

1587
01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:29.146
Shit! Give me 10 minutes?

1588
01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.026
I'll meet you at the closet.

1589
01:24:34.152 --> 01:24:35.736
At the closet.

1590
01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.288
You wanted to
see me, Michelle?

1591
01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.415
Oh! Okay. Sit.

1592
01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:53.963
So, Jim said that you've always kind of been there for him

1593
01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:55.339
when he needed you.

1594
01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.675
So I thought maybe
you could help me.

1595
01:24:57.968 --> 01:24:59.510
Jim said that?

1596
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.224
What's the problem?

1597
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.605
I still can't
get my vows right.

1598
01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:15.234
I haven't been this confused
since I got my first period.

1599
01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.945
That's a very confusing time
for any young lady.

1600
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:21.365
You know, your body is
going through changes.

1601
01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:26.329
Stuff coming out,
stuff going in.

1602
01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.999
No. I need help with
my vows, not my period.

1603
01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:32.251
Oh, your vows.
Your vows.

1604
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:36.172
Yes, good. Go on.

1605
01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:39.258
Jim just wants a groomsmen meeting before the wedding.

1606
01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:43.304
It shouldn't take long.
Just don't let her talk to anyone.

1607
01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.430
All right.

1608
01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:45.639
Be careful. She's feisty.

1609
01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.729
Okay, let's go.

1610
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:55.483
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming out here and meeting me.

1611
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.194
I just have a couple
of things I want to say.

1612
01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.737
This sucks.

1613
01:26:04.034 --> 01:26:05.743
Did I say that out loud?

1614
01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:10.247
Keep going. It's good.

1615
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:14.710
You know, I thought
about what you said, Kev,

1616
01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.422
about how my problems
always seem to work out.

1617
01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:22.593
And I realized that the reason things always work out

1618
01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:27.431
is because you guys have always been there to back me up.

1619
01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.517
Even you, Stifler.

1620
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.146
For the first time
in my life,

1621
01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:39.151
I actually feel like
I can't mess anything up.

1622
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.864
Which is pretty amazing.

1623
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:50.454
So I guess I just
wanted to say thank you.

1624
01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.166
Thanks.

1625
01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:58.504
Thanks? This whole
thing was about thanks?

1626
01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.007
You're welcome, cock block.

1627
01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:06.679
That was good, Jim.
Real nice.

1628
01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.265
Let's get you married.

1629
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.558
Okay.

1630
01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:15.062
Love is very
difficult to describe.

1631
01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:18.232
And I understand the angst.
I mean, it's your wedding.

1632
01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:20.776
And it's natural.
It's perfectly natural.

1633
01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:24.196
But it's impossible
to describe a feeling.

1634
01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:27.366
Okay, first,
nothing is impossible.

1635
01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.535
So let's not focus on that.

1636
01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:32.037
Why do you think, Michelle,

1637
01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:35.541
they call it making love?

1638
01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.920
I don't know.
I just call it boning.

1639
01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:43.382
"Boning"?

1640
01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:47.428
When you're doing
other things with Jim,

1641
01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:49.680
when you're not boning,

1642
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.057
how does he make you feel?

1643
01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.186
Horny, like I want to bone.

1644
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.355
But we can't be boning
from sunrise to sunset, dear.

1645
01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:00.232
Oh, you've never tried it?

1646
01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:04.236
I certainly have.
I have. I've boned.

1647
01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:08.240
From sunrise, right through brunch,
on more than one occasion.

1648
01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:10.284
But boning aside,

1649
01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:14.288
I think they call it
making love because

1650
01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.957
you have to make love work.

1651
01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:21.003
You know, it's about
compromise and sacrifice

1652
01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.005
and I think Jim has
sacrificed for you.

1653
01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:25.716
My God, he shaved his
entire pubic region,

1654
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.927
which would
baffle most cultures

1655
01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:30.221
around the world,
but he did it.

1656
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.432
And he did it for you.

1657
01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.646
You're right.
Love isn't just a feeling.

1658
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.440
It's shaving your balls.

1659
01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:43.943
Thanks, Dad.

1660
01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:48.739
I wouldn't get into too much detail on that, dear.

1661
01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:51.075
Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1662
01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:53.118
Yeah. Excuse me.
Touch me. Fuck me.

1663
01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:55.204
I'm gonna have
sex with Cadence.

1664
01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:06.715
You know, Son,
I think this is probably

1665
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.842
the right time to
tell you that...

1666
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:13.889
I know, Dad.

1667
01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:27.361
I can't see anything here.

1668
01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:33.242
Oh, there you are.

1669
01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:37.997
Guys, what are you doing?
Where's Jim's grandma?

1670
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.624
The old bitch sucked.
We had to ditch her.

1671
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.917
You what?

1672
01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:44.878
Don't worry.
We put her someplace no one will find her.

1673
01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.090
Cadence, where are
you going?

1674
01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.717
Oh, Mom.

1675
01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:54.513
Oh, baby,
I'm so ready for this.

1676
01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:00.436
Your body's not quite what I was expecting.
But that's okay.

1677
01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:03.689
The Stiffman digs
what's underneath.

1678
01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:08.319
Oh, you are so beautiful.

1679
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.363
I just wanted...

1680
01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:13.866
Stifler!

1681
01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:15.534
Granny.

1682
01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:16.827
Granny what?

1683
01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.746
Focus! Focus! Focus!

1684
01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.499
It's not what
it looks like!

1685
01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:25.210
Shut the fucking door!

1686
01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.545
You got it, champ.

1687
01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:52.154
You're a hero.

1688
01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.948
Hey, pussy's pussy.

1689
01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.745
Look at the smile
on my mother's face.

1690
01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:03.832
Do you know how long she's been waiting for a day like this?

1691
01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.834
I can't imagine.

1692
01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:13.050
I couldn't be happier.

1693
01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.343
Thank you.

1694
01:31:16.846 --> 01:31:18.055
Don't.

1695
01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:23.143
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.

1696
01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.567
What made Grandma
come around?

1697
01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.111
Finch said
Stifler talked to her.

1698
01:31:32.278 --> 01:31:33.779
Stifler?

1699
01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:39.118
Grandmotherfucker.

1700
01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:41.745
You're a motherfucker.

1701
01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.747
Yes, I am.

1702
01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:46.250
You son of a bitch.

1703
01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:51.004
And I promise to love you
for as long as I shall live.

1704
01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:55.300
Michelle, you are the one woman I want to be with

1705
01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:58.137
and the woman
I can't be without.

1706
01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.306
I love you.

1707
01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:23.287
Jim, I had trouble finding the words to tell you how I feel

1708
01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.081
and I realized something.

1709
01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:28.751
Love isn't just a feeling.

1710
01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.087
Love is something you do.

1711
01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.924
It's a dress,
a visit to band camp,

1712
01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:38.260
a special haircut.

1713
01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:42.723
Jim, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted,

1714
01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:47.686
and it is my solemn vow to give everything I am to you.

1715
01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:53.859
Thanks.

1716
01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:06.413
James Emanuel Levenstein and Michelle Annabeth Flaherty,

1717
01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:09.291
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1718
01:33:09.959 --> 01:33:12.002
You may kiss the bride.

1719
01:33:29.979 --> 01:33:33.982
Let's all welcome Mr. And Mrs.
Jim and Michelle Levenstein

1720
01:33:34.067 --> 01:33:35.526
onto the dance floor.

1721
01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:36.652
Just follow my lead.

1722
01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:37.820
I'll try.

1723
01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:09.726
I taught him that.

1724
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.564
Jim, you learnt to dance.

1725
01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:57.649
Well, it seems like
everything worked out.

1726
01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:59.151
Magnificently.

1727
01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:00.777
I feel a bit sad

1728
01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:04.156
that tonight our little Michelle is gonna be a woman.

1729
01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:08.076
Honey, you don't honestly believe that Michelle is still a...

1730
01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:11.872
I tell you, Mary,
I can't recall a single moment with either one of them

1731
01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:13.790
that would make
me think otherwise.

1732
01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:15.709
Thank you. See?

1733
01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:18.295
Whoa!

1734
01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:27.846
Hey, tough guy.

1735
01:35:28.014 --> 01:35:29.514
Stifler's mom.

1736
01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:33.226
Well, we meet again.

1737
01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.105
I was curious.
Didn't see you here.

1738
01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:39.900
I try to keep a low profile.

1739
01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:42.819
I never really did
like these things, anyway.

1740
01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:46.239
You know,
this has actually made quite an impression on me.

1741
01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:49.159
I have something to
look for in a woman now.

1742
01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.663
Well, if this is your idea
of a proposal, Finchy,

1743
01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:54.748
you gotta know
that I'm over you now.

1744
01:35:54.832 --> 01:35:56.541
And I'm over you.

1745
01:35:57.669 --> 01:36:00.587
But as they say,
we will always have Paris.

1746
01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.047
And the pool table.

1747
01:36:02.131 --> 01:36:03.173
And the car.

1748
01:36:03.299 --> 01:36:05.217
And the two-room
suite I have upstairs.

1749
01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:06.718
Come here.

1750
01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:15.519
This turned out better
than I could ever imagine.

1751
01:36:16.062 --> 01:36:19.398
How did a little perv like you turn into such a great guy?

1752
01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:23.235
How did a little nympho like you turn into such a great girl?

1753
01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:24.569
I'm still a nympho.

1754
01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:25.946
I'm still a perv.

1755
01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:29.074
I know.
What's wrong with us?

1756
01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.709
You did it.

1757
01:36:47.844 --> 01:36:52.472
You know, Michelle,
to quote someone I've learned quite a bit from,

1758
01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.892
I think you and I are

1759
01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:59.438
"a perfectly natural,
normal thing."

1760
01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:02.774
Perfectly natural.

1761
01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:22.377
That's her.

1762
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:23.628
Holy shit, dude.

1763
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.548
I told you this
wedding would be worth it.

1764
01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.842
Oh, my goddess. My queen.

1765
01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:31.553
My MILF.
MILF.

1766
01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:51.031
No way, bro.

1767
01:37:51.491 --> 01:37:54.618
Hey, you're not finished yet,
are you, Finchy?

1768
01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:58.705
No, ma'am.
Just getting started.

1769
01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.750
This guy is
the fucking master.

1770
01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:05.796
Oh, no!

1771
01:38:05.963 --> 01:38:07.798
Make it stop.
Make it stop.

1772
01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:10.300
Oh, Stifler's mom.
