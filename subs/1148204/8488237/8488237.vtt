你说什么  它还在动啊

26
00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.711

30
00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:57.326
你在干什么  你在干什么
What are you doing? What are you doing?

31
00:02:57.493 --> 00:02:59.120
你可能会有拉扯的感觉
You might feel some tugging.

32
00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.796
天哪  这不是真的

恭喜  科尔曼女士  是个女孩儿

34
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:32.043
对  凯特  那些梦可能是你情绪的表现
Yes, Kate, your dreams can be a manifestation of your emotions.

35
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.382
那是你机体对于过去发生的事
It's your body and mind's way of dealing...

36
00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:37.048
造成的压力和痛苦的处理方式
...with the stress and grief of what happened.

37
00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.922
要是这和死产没有关系呢
What if this has nothing to do with the stillbirth?

38
00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:41.996
那你认为这和什么有关
What do you think it's about?

39
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.601
这周末我们打算去看孩子
We're seeing kids for the first time this weekend.

40
00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.227
或许那些噩梦...
And maybe the nightmares...

41
00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:57.344
或许我还没准备好要收养孩子
Maybe I'm just not ready to adopt yet.

42
00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:06.883
那晚我开车回家路过一家烟酒铺
I drove by the wine shop on the way home the other night.

43
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.619
你停下来了吗
Did you stop?

44
00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:13.626
没  本来想停的  这念头一闪而过
No. Wanted to. The thought went through my brain, you know?

45
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.730
不是想给我自己买  不是...
It wasn't for myself. It wasn't...

46
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:18.639
我只是想有瓶酒备着总是好的
I just thought it would be nice to have a bottle handy,

47
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.857
以防有客人突然造访
In case we had guests.

48
00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:21.264
但你没进去
But you didn't go in.

49
00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.433
在我看来  关键...
The key, to me...

50
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.044
不在于你有喝酒的欲望...
...is not that you had the urge...

51
00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:31.874
而在于你能够克制它
...but that you resisted it.

52
00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:35.950
要是没准备好你也不会通过家庭调研的
You wouldn't have made it through the home study if you weren't ready.

53
00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:37.586
但终究...
But, ultimately...

54
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.222
...决定权还在于你
...you have to decide.

59

Let's go. I'm cold.

62
00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.090

别扔了
Stop throwing!

66
00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:26.617
我在工作呢
I'm working.

67
00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:27.689
对不起

68
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.952
不  宝贝  我才应该道歉
No, honey, I'm sorry.

69
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.650
休息一会儿  行吗
Just take a break for a little while, okay?

70
00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:34.887
因为妈妈要弹琴  好吗
Because Mommy's trying to play. Okay?

71
00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.102
爸爸回来了
Daddy's here.

72
00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:46.140
我的了
Mine.

73
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.838
不好意思  训练拖延了一会儿
Sorry, practice went a little late.

74
00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:52.480
没关系
It's all right. whoa.

-好小子  球给我  -真阴险
- Okay, tough guy. Give me that. - Wicked.

76
00:08:57.587 --> 00:08:58.918
不  不

77
00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:01.522
投啊  投啊  快  快  快
Shoot it, shoot it. Go, go, go, go.

78
00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:05.421
好  来击个掌
Yes! Give me five.

79
00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.529
今天过得怎么样  丹尼尔
Hey, how did it go? Daniel.

80
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.288
还行
Fine.

81
00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:20.274
就玩5分钟  最后一关了
Five minutes. I'm at the last level.

82
00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:22.206
不准玩游戏了  去刷牙
No more video games. Brush your teeth.

83
00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:25.040
这不公平  存不了档  求你了  老爸  行吗
That's no fair. It won't save. Come on, Dad, please?

84
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.849
今晚讲个别的故事吧

85
00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:40.512
那好吧

86
00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:51.533
为了见我刚出生的小妹妹

87
00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:56.219
我等了整整一晚上

88
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.238
但是...

89
00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:03.520
爸爸妈妈回来的时候

90
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.876
妈妈告诉我

91
00:10:05.694 --> 00:10:10.017
我的小妹妹去了天堂

92
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:20.054
小妹妹去了天堂我很高兴

93
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:32.780
但我要是先见见她就好了

94
00:10:37.373 --> 00:10:40.890
杰西卡宝宝是天使吗

95
00:10:43.468 --> 00:10:47.357
对  是个漂亮的天使

96
00:11:04.647 --> 00:11:09.643
我还会再有个妹妹吗

97
00:11:15.597 --> 00:11:18.085
我也不知道

圣玛丽亚娜女子孤儿院

99
00:11:51.994 --> 00:11:53.018

你真香啊
You smell good.

103
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.042
好吧
Okay.

104
00:12:18.287 --> 00:12:20.312
那好吧
All right.

105
00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:27.327
我不能再这样了
I have to stop being like this.

106
00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:29.191
我明白
I get it.

107
00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:41.332
我很兴奋  很快乐
I'm very excited, I'm happy.

108
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.837
但也很紧张
I get nervous.

109
00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:46.874
我真的好怕
I'm really scared.

110
00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:54.879
上次我感到这一切恰恰是失去孩子之前
Last time I felt all of this was right before I lost the baby.

111
00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:58.584
我不想让你觉得这么做是为了我
I don't want you to feel like we have to go through with this for my sake.

112
00:12:58.761 --> 00:13:02.094
不只是...不只是为你
It's not just... it's not for you.

113
00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:04.357
我想把我们对杰西卡的爱...
I wanna take the love we felt for Jessica...

114
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:08.492
我想把它给予真正需要它的人
...and I wanna give it to somebody who really needs it.

115
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:13.842
你想清楚了吗  宝贝
Are you sure, hon?

116
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.206
想清楚了
Yes.

圣玛丽亚娜女子孤儿院

118
00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:42.369

119
00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:43.937
外面真冷
It's really cold out here.

120
00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:52.373

瞧瞧那个雪堆成的孤儿
Look at the snow orphan.

127
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.142
雪堆成的孤儿?
Snow orphan?

128
00:14:23.312 --> 00:14:25.780
雪孤?
Uh, snorphan?

129
00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:40.191
不  给玛丽修女看
Hey. No, show it to sister Mary.

130
00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:06.353
-慢点  慢点  -你抓不到我
- Slow down, slow down. - You can't catch me.

131
00:15:06.522 --> 00:15:07.648

00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:58.670
这些都是你画的?

133
00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:02.572
-对  你喜欢吗  -画得真棒

我叫艾斯特  你呢

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.841

137
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.781
-我能坐下吗  -当然
- Can I take a seat? - Of course.

138
00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:19.786
我怎么也看不烦这些孩子跑啊跳啊的
I never get tired of watching these kids enjoy the party.

139
00:16:19.962 --> 00:16:22.453
真是  真遗憾没能早点来
It really is. I'm so sorry we didn't do this sooner.

140
00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:24.462
别这样  这毕竟是一大步
Don't be. It's a big leap.

141
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.797
收养一个年纪大点的孩子没法轻易决定
Adopting an older child is not an easy decision to make.

142
00:16:30.372 --> 00:16:31.532
约翰去卫生间了
John's in the bathroom.

143
00:16:31.707 --> 00:16:34.073
他能找到我们吗  还是去找找他?
Think he'll find us? Do you wanna go look for him?

144
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.784
你这幅画的灵感是什么
Where did you get the idea for this one?

145
00:16:36.784 --> 00:16:39.078
我的画总是有故事的
My paintings always tell stories.

146
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:42.581
这幅画是讲一个找不到幼崽的伤心的母狮子
This one's about a sad mother lion who can't find her cubs.

147
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:46.187
-可她在微笑  -她梦见自己的宝宝了
- She's smiling. - She's dreaming about her babies.

148
00:16:46.689 --> 00:16:48.623
只有这个能让她高兴起来
It's the only thing that makes her happy.

149
00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:53.194
-希望她能找到孩子  -会的  看
- I hope she finds them. - She will. Look.

150
00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:59.595
他们在森林里迷路了  又惊又怕...
They were lost in the jungle, and they were so scared...

151
00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:01.895
因为他们找不到爸爸妈妈了
...because they didn't have a mother or father.

152
00:17:02.071 --> 00:17:04.471
正当他们以为要永远孤单下去的时候...
Just when they thought they'd be alone forever...

153
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.269
他们发现妈妈在这棵树下熟睡着
...they found their mother asleep under this tree.

154
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.936
现在等她醒了  她的梦想也就成真了
Now when she wakes up, her dream will have come true.

155
00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.641
-她又有家人了  -真棒  这故事是你想出来的?
- She'll have her family again. - Amazing. You came up with that story?

156
00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:18.309
-我听到他的声音了  -对
- I think I hear his voice down here. - Yes.

157
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:23.113
介绍一下  这是我妻子  凯特
I want to introduce you. This is my wife, Kate.

158
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:24.657
凯特  这是艾斯特
Kate, this is Esther.

159
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.298
你好  见到你真高兴
How are you? Nice to meet you.

160
00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:35.599
这些都是她画的
She painted all these.

161
00:17:35.771 --> 00:17:36.795
-真的?  -对
- Really? - Yeah.

162
00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.702
画得太漂亮了  真的很棒
These are fantastic. These are really wonderful.

163
00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:42.275
-谢谢  -你是从哪儿学的
- Thank you. - Where did you learn how to do this?

164
00:17:42.444 --> 00:17:45.641
我想只是我练习的时间很多罢了
I've just had lots of time to practice, I guess.

165
00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:48.612
这里真的很无聊
It's really boring here.

166
00:17:48.784 --> 00:17:50.775
这儿很无聊?
It's boring here?

167
00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:53.615
你要是无聊  干吗不下去参加派对呢
If you're so bored, why aren't you down at the party?

168
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:55.670
我一直觉得那没什么意义
I've never really seen the point of it.

169
00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:58.453
以前也没人跟我说过话
Nobody's ever talked to me before.

170
00:17:59.394 --> 00:18:00.486
我想我比较特别吧
I guess I'm different.

171
00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:02.857
特别一点没什么不好的
There's nothing wrong with being different.

172
00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.999
你们俩共同点还挺多
Well, you two have a lot in common.

173
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.505
我认为人们总应该...
I think people should always...

174
00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:14.141
承受自己身上发生的不幸...
...try to take the bad things that happen to them...

175
00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:16.675
...并化不幸为幸事
...and turn them into something good.

176
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:19.643
-你觉得呢  -是啊
- Don't you? - Yeah.

177
00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:21.715
当然
Absolutely.

178
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.882
她是从俄罗斯来的  但英文好得惊人
She's originally from Russia, but it's amazing how strong her English is.

179
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.358
她来美国才几年而已
Given she's only been in the country a few years.

180
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.555
你们经常收留外国孩子?
How often do you get children from other countries?

181
00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:40.896
很少  有时外国孩子很难适应
It's rare. But when we do, it's sometimes difficult to place them.

182
00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:45.236
把她带来美国的那家人因房子失火丧生了
The family that brought her to America died in a house fire.

183
00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:46.840
失火?
In a fire?

184
00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:48.408
我的天啊
My God.

185
00:18:48.577 --> 00:18:50.101
艾斯特险些丧命
Esther barely got out.

186
00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:55.407
她经历了不少  但这是个出色的小姑娘
She's been through a lot, but this is an extraordinary little girl.

187
00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:58.553
她很聪明  比同龄人成熟很多
She's very bright. She's very mature for her age.

188
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.850
而且很有教养  说实话  有点像小公主
And she's very well-mannered. She's a bit of a princess, actually.

189
00:19:03.025 --> 00:19:06.825
她的脖子和手腕上一直系着缎带
She wears those ribbons on her wrists and her neck all the time.

190
00:19:07.462 --> 00:19:08.520
我也是
Mine too.

191
00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:11.461
我们想给她解下来时  她还死活不愿意
We had trouble with her when we tried to take them off.

192
00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:13.464
她和其他孩子相处得怎么样
How does she get along with other kids?

193
00:19:13.635 --> 00:19:15.899
她不得不交流的时候  表现很好
Oh, when she has to interact, she's great.

194
00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:18.198
亲爱的?
Babe?

195
00:19:18.373 --> 00:19:21.570
-她好像真愿跟我们说心里话  -对
- She really did seem to open up with us. - Yeah.

196
00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:24.541
我认为她不只愿跟你们说心里话
I thought she more than opened up with you.

197
00:19:24.713 --> 00:19:26.806
你们看来已经像一家人了
You seem to have made quite a connection.

198
00:19:26.982 --> 00:19:31.146
我可以把手续备齐  3周后你们再过来
I could get the paperwork together and see you back here in three weeks.

199
00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:39.154
好的
All right.

200
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:50.129
太好了
Okey-dokey.

201
00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:52.330
有事再电话联系
Call me if you need anything.

202
00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:54.270
再见  好  谢谢
Bye. Okay, thank you.

203
00:20:13.962 --> 00:20:16.453
那是T和H
Oh, that's t-h.

204
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.260
T和H  对
T-h. Yeah.

205
00:20:19.434 --> 00:20:21.527
"麦可思"是这样表示吗
And "Max" is like this?

206
00:20:21.703 --> 00:20:22.761
对
Yeah.

207
00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:25.631
不错
Good.

208
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:34.347
-这是你们的家吗  -现在也是你家了
- Is this your house? - Now it's your house too.

209
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:54.667
宝贝  看看谁来了
Hi, sweetie. Look who's here.

210
00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:03.644
你好  麦可思  我叫艾斯特
Hello, Max. My name is Esther.

211
00:21:04.212 --> 00:21:06.544
她一路上一直在练习
She's been practicing the whole way.

212
00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:10.709
-她能听见吗  -就一点儿
- Can she hear?  - A little.

213
00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:12.683
她生下来几乎全聋
She was born almost completely deaf.

214
00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:16.051
那点听力对她读唇语刚刚足够
That just allows her to hear enough to read lips.

215
00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:22.085
没关系  行李我拎好了
That's all right, I got it.

216
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:28.935
艾斯特  来认识一下芭芭拉奶奶
Esther, I'd like to introduce you to grandma Barbara.

217
00:21:29.104 --> 00:21:31.766
见到您很高兴
It's a pleasure to meet you.

218
00:21:31.974 --> 00:21:34.966

Hello, Daniel.

222
00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:52.724
她为什么穿成那样
Why does she dress like that?

223
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:56.057
-行了  住嘴  -我只是问问而已
- Come on. Stop it. - I'm just asking a question.

224
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.892
-你们有钢琴?  -对

怎么说"谢谢"?
How do you say "thank you"?

230
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:30.598
谢谢
Thank you.

231
00:22:30.878 --> 00:22:31.925
谢谢

232
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.772
不客气

233
00:22:40.002 --> 00:22:42.805
瞧瞧那个
Wow, look at that.

234
00:22:42.978 --> 00:22:45.970
什么  什么  什么
What? What? What?

235
00:22:46.148 --> 00:22:47.410
爸  看啊
Dad, look.

236
00:22:47.582 --> 00:22:49.106
-爸  -你从哪儿找到的
- Dad. - Where did you get that?

237
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:52.276
-爸  看  我要打败特莱弗了  -真棒
- Dad, look, I'm killing Trevor. - Great.

238
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.255
谢谢
Thank you.

239
00:22:58.427 --> 00:23:00.861
来啊  爸爸  我的独奏快完了  快看哪
Come on, Dad. My solo's gonna end. Hurry, look.

240
00:23:02.431 --> 00:23:04.365
太酷了
Wow, cool.

241
00:23:09.204 --> 00:23:11.866
-特莱弗  你逊毙了  -闭嘴
- Trevor, you suck. - Shut up.

242
00:23:13.442 --> 00:23:15.842
真不错
That's fabulous.

243
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:19.379
走吧  伙计们  真没意思
Come on, guys. This is lame.

244
00:23:19.581 --> 00:23:21.811
我差点就要赢你了
I was just about to beat you.

245
00:23:22.784 --> 00:23:25.116
你喜欢就好  宝贝
I'm glad you like it, honey.

246
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:43.632
快点  伙计们
Come on, guys.

247
00:23:49.144 --> 00:23:51.476
快点  我快冻死了
Hurry up, I'm freezing my ass off.

248
00:23:51.646 --> 00:23:56.379
-伙计们  都在这儿  -天哪  我的手都冻僵了
- Dude, it's all in here. - Oh, God. My hands are freezing.

249
00:23:57.185 --> 00:23:58.652
她真性感
Oh, man, she's hot.

250
00:23:59.154 --> 00:24:02.146
-往那边挪点  伙计  -34页会让你终生难忘的
- Move over, man. - Page 34 will change your life.

251
00:24:06.128 --> 00:24:07.823
这个看起来像你妈
This looks like your Mom.

252
00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:11.563
不
No.

253
00:24:16.238 --> 00:24:18.536
艾斯特和玛克辛看来相处得不错
Esther and Maxine seem to be getting along well.

254
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:19.901
对
Yeah.

255
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:21.770
她怎么样  凯特
How's she doing, Kate?

256
00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:24.275
艾斯特适应得挺快
Esther's fitting right in.

257
00:24:24.446 --> 00:24:26.073
我是说玛克辛
I meant Maxine.

258
00:24:26.248 --> 00:24:28.876
她在池塘边玩好像什么也没发生过一样
She's playing by the pond like nothing ever happened.

259
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.711
她不记得了  对吧
She doesn't remember, does she?

260
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.286
对  她很好
No. She's fine.

261
00:24:38.193 --> 00:24:41.856
那么  你怎么打算的
So, what are your plans?

262
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.056
大概先帮艾斯特好好适应一下...
You know, probably get Esther settled...

263
00:24:45.901 --> 00:24:47.869
然后再去教课
...then go back to teaching.

264
00:24:48.036 --> 00:24:49.970
学校不是不让你回去了吗
Thought they weren't gonna take you back.

265
00:24:50.172 --> 00:24:51.639
不  我不是说回耶鲁
No, I'm not talking about Yale.

266
00:24:51.806 --> 00:24:54.900
我就...或许在家里教教课吧
I'll just... I'll probably give lessons from home.

267
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.442
真可惜  那工作多好啊
That's too bad. That was a very good job.

268
00:24:57.612 --> 00:24:59.580
又不是我不想干的
Well, I didn't quit because I wanted to.

269
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:02.911
我明白  你必须花时间来"净身"
I know. You had to have your moment of clarity.

270
00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.609
那是戒酒协会的术语
That is an a.a. term.

271
00:25:06.388 --> 00:25:08.652
我又没去戒酒协会  我只是不喝了
And I didn't go to a.a. I just stopped drinking.

272
00:25:08.823 --> 00:25:12.418
还不是一样  有时我们都需要清醒清醒
Same difference. We all need a wake-up call sometimes.

273
00:26:22.063 --> 00:26:25.157
来
Come here.

274
00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:44.912
什么事
Yeah?

275
00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:49.987
我们害怕闪电
We're scared of the lightning.

276
00:26:50.158 --> 00:26:51.853
进来吧
Oh, come in.

277
00:26:52.661 --> 00:26:57.655
-我想挨着爸爸睡  -等会儿
- I wanna sleep next to Daddy. - Hang on.

278
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.697
好了

00:27:09.644 --> 00:27:12.010
我等会儿打电话回来  确保一切顺利
I'm gonna call later, make sure everything's okay.

280
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.375
好的  你的设计会大受欢迎的
Okay. They're gonna love your design.

281
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.414
-等会儿接电话好吗  -好的
- You gonna pick up the phone? - Yeah.

282
00:27:16.584 --> 00:27:18.176
好的
All right.

283
00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.885
艾斯特?
Esther?

284
00:27:21.056 --> 00:27:22.751
艾斯特?
Esther?

285
00:27:22.924 --> 00:27:24.619
快点
Come on.

286
00:27:24.826 --> 00:27:28.262
艾斯特  快点  咱们该走了
Esther, come on, we gotta go!

287
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.729
开什么玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

288
00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:38.335
-你们去车里等着好吗  -走吧
- Will you please go wait in the car? - Come on.

289
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.804
宝贝  穿这裙子上学可不合适
Sweetheart, this isn't really a school dress.

290
00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.539
但我喜欢  你不觉得很漂亮吗
But I like it. Don't you think it's pretty?

291
00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:49.308
对  的确很漂亮...
Yes, it's so beautiful...

292
00:27:49.484 --> 00:27:52.578
但我想你穿这个会不舒服的
...but I just don't think you're gonna be comfortable in it.

293
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:53.880
穿我给你买的那条牛仔裤怎么样
What about those jeans that I bought you?

294
00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:56.922
你担心其他同学会笑话我  对吧
You're afraid the other children will laugh at me, aren't you?

295
00:27:57.092 --> 00:28:01.552
你不是说过特别一点没什么不好吗
I thought you said there wasn't anything wrong with being different.

296
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.263
对  你说得对  说得很对
Yes, you're right. You're absolutely right.

297
00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:08.129
好吧  开心点
Okay. Have fun.

298
00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:12.164
请坐好  坐好
Take a seat, please. Take a seat.

299
00:28:12.374 --> 00:28:14.501
请别再让我说一遍
Don't make me ask again, please.

300
00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:18.503
这是我们的新同学  她叫艾斯特·科尔曼
Okay, this is our new student. Her name's Esther Coleman.

301
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.808
我希望今天大家能对她热情一点
And I'd like you all to make her feel very welcome today.

302
00:28:21.983 --> 00:28:24.364
瞧  小宝皮给我发了个短信
Oh, look. Little Bo Peep texted me.

303
00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:25.419
她想要回她的裙子
She wants her outfit back.

304
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.819
好  去坐下吧

306
00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:41.493
不

307
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:43.933

308
00:28:44.105 --> 00:28:46.938
离开那儿  不要
Get away from there! No!

309
00:28:47.108 --> 00:28:50.976
不准在池塘附近玩  你知道的
You don't play near the water! You know that!

310
00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:52.443
快点  快出来
Come on, get out!

311
00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:55.676
麦可思

真棒  正中红心
Sweet. Bull's-eye.

313
00:29:17.172 --> 00:29:18.298
打中你了
Got you.

314
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.825
-你把它打死了?  -只是个颜料球
- Did you kill it? - It's just a paint ball.

315
00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:55.173
我没想到会伤害它
I didn't think it would hurt him.

316
00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.353
让它解脱痛苦吧
Put it out of its misery.

317
00:30:08.022 --> 00:30:11.326
它很痛苦  这是你的责任
It's in pain, and it's your responsibility.

318
00:30:11.327 --> 00:30:12.459
这只是个意外
It was just an accident.

319
00:30:12.627 --> 00:30:14.959
如果你现在走了  它就得饿死
If you walk away now, it'll starve to death.

320
00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:16.687
你想那样吗
Is that what you want?

321
00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:23.727
我什么都没做
I'm not doing it.

322
00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:31.644
好了
It's all right.

323
00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:34.543
-它现在已经在天堂了  -你神经病
- It's in heaven now. - What's wrong with you?

324
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.620
-水热吗   -热  谢谢
- Is the water warm enough?  - Yes, thank you.

325
00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:47.022
好的  有事叫我
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

326
00:31:05.046 --> 00:31:06.809
艾斯特?
Esther?

327
00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:09.583
艾斯特
Esther.

328
00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:11.752
把门打开
Open this door.

329
00:31:15.657 --> 00:31:18.251
-你在做什么  -我一般都把门锁上的
- What are you doing? - I always lock the door.

330
00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:20.257
不  在家里我们不用锁门
No, we don't lock doors in this house.

331
00:31:20.428 --> 00:31:22.487
但是万一有人进来看到我怎么办
But what if someone comes in and sees me?

332
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:24.424
没人会进来
Nobody's gonna come in.

333
00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.625
好吧  我就在这儿站着  如果你想这样
Look, I'm gonna stand right here, if that's what you want.

334
00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:29.326
我可以给你唱歌
I could sing for you.

335
00:31:29.504 --> 00:31:33.838
我以前常常给我姐妹们唱歌  那样他们就知道我没事了
I used to sing for the sisters so they would know I was all right.

336
00:31:36.344 --> 00:31:38.107
好吧
Okay.

337
00:31:38.613 --> 00:31:42.071
好吧  但是你要知道  只有今晚这样
All right. But you know what? This is just for tonight.

338
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:31.623
你父母一定去了很多孤儿院才找到她
Your parents must have gone to a lot of retard camps to find her.

339
00:33:33.494 --> 00:33:35.121
看着点
Watch it.

340
00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:38.089
你还好吗
Are you okay?

341
00:33:43.705 --> 00:33:45.263
这是圣经吗
Is this a Bible?

342
00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:50.971
耶稣迷今天带圣经来学校了
Jesus freak brought a Bible to school today.

343
00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:57.082
想拿回去吗
Hey, wanna come over?

344
00:34:03.224 --> 00:34:05.818
-好样的  -你妹妹是一个十足的笨蛋
- Good one. - Your sister's a total spaz.

345
00:34:05.993 --> 00:34:07.483
她不是我妹妹
She's not my sister.

346
00:34:09.797 --> 00:34:11.594
真不敢相信你会那么做
I can't believe you did that.

347
00:34:11.766 --> 00:34:15.463
小巴狗  这是你的项圈吗  小巴狗?
Oh, little doggy. Is this your collar, little doggy?

348
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:35.380
不  A  A  B
Not a. a, b.

349
00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:43.154
你弹得真的很不错
You did really good.

350
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:47.358
不  不好  我错了11处
No, I didn't. I made like 11 mistakes.

351
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.294
下次我会弹得更好的
I'll do better next time.

352
00:34:51.005 --> 00:34:53.872
老师告诉我今天学校发生的事了
Your teacher told me what happened today.

353
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.035
你想和我谈谈吗
Don't you want to talk about it?

354
00:34:58.212 --> 00:35:00.407
没什么可谈的
There's nothing to talk about.

355
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:03.916
你知道我是为你来的  好吧  你知道的是吗
You know I'm here for you, right? You know that, right?

356
00:35:05.153 --> 00:35:07.917
我有件东西想给你看
I got something I wanna show you.

357
00:35:12.593 --> 00:35:14.891
我有这么个本子  用来写日记
I have one just like this that I use as a diary.

358
00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:18.930
我想也许我们可以一起用这个...
And I thought that maybe you and I could use this one...

359
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.727
...做个剪贴簿
...for a scrapbook.

360
00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:24.594
这是爸爸和妈妈结婚的日子
That's Mommy and Daddy on their wedding day.

361
00:35:26.007 --> 00:35:28.441
这是丹尼尔  圣诞节的早晨
That's Daniel, Christmas morning.

362
00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:31.577
这个是麦可思
Here's Max.

363
00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:35.543
这个是你
And there's you.

364
00:35:41.122 --> 00:35:43.181
杰西卡是谁
Who's Jessica?

365
00:35:44.425 --> 00:35:47.121
麦可思提起过她
Max talks about her.

366
00:35:47.962 --> 00:35:50.954
"我从没抱过你  但我能感觉到你"
"I never held you, but I feel you."

367
00:35:51.132 --> 00:35:54.898
"你从未说过话  但我能聆听到你"
"You never spoke, but I hear you."

368
00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:01.071
"我从没未了解你  但是我爱你"
"I never knew you, but I love you."

369
00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.041
她怎么了
What happened to her?

370
00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:13.445
她死了  还在我肚子里的时候
She died while she was still in my tummy.

371
00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:16.716
我们把她的骨灰埋葬在这儿
But we scattered her ashes here.

372
00:36:17.291 --> 00:36:20.727
随着这棵植物的生长...
And as long as this plant grows...

373
00:36:20.895 --> 00:36:25.594
...她也会有部分存活在其中
...then part of her will be alive inside it.

374
00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:36.270
她应该是幸运的
She would have been lucky.

375
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.275
你是一个伟大的妈妈
You're a great Mommy.

376
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:46.510
谢谢  甜心
Thank you, sweetheart.

377
00:36:46.687 --> 00:36:49.451
谢谢  这很有意义
Thank you. It means a lot.

378
00:36:53.427 --> 00:36:56.089
-你好吗   -很好
- How are you? - I'm good.

379
00:36:56.264 --> 00:37:00.598
太有趣了  艾斯特今天开始说话了
It's very interesting. Esther started to open up today.

380
00:37:00.768 --> 00:37:01.962
真是太有趣了
That's very interesting.

381
00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:04.627
我开始觉得这是一次真正的交流
I'm starting to feel like there's a real connection.

382
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:06.830
我也是
Me too.

383
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.837
不  亲爱的  这儿不行
No, honey, not here.

384
00:37:12.013 --> 00:37:13.503
他们都睡着了
They're sleeping.

385
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:17.549
宝贝  来吧  你会喜欢的  相信我
Baby, come here, you'll like it, believe me.

386
00:37:24.125 --> 00:37:26.355
-好吧  我们言归正传  -不  不  不
- Okay, let's get down to business. - No, no, no.

387
00:37:26.527 --> 00:37:29.553
来吧  就几分钟
Okay, just for a second, then.

388
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.357
好吧
Yeah.

389
00:37:40.708 --> 00:37:42.300
-不  不  不  -来吧
- No, no, no. - Come on.

390
00:37:42.476 --> 00:37:45.741
我要  等等  等等
I have to. Wait, wait, wait.

391
00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:55.185
很好
Yeah.

392
00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:24.207
对不起
Oh, sorry.

393
00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:42.099
上帝
Oh, Jesus.

394
00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:45.900
上帝  亲爱的  真该死
Jesus, honey. Damn it.

395
00:38:51.812 --> 00:38:53.507
艾斯特?
Esther?

396
00:38:54.915 --> 00:38:57.247
我们得谈谈昨天晚上的事
We have to talk about last night.

397
00:38:57.418 --> 00:39:00.251
-需要吗  -是的  必须
- Do we? - Yes, we do.

398
00:39:02.723 --> 00:39:05.453
听着  有些大人做的事情...
See, there are certain things that grown-ups do...

399
00:39:05.626 --> 00:39:08.720
...小孩子不应该偷看
...that children aren't supposed to see.

400
00:39:08.896 --> 00:39:12.923
那就是其中一件
And that was one of them.

401
00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:19.299
艾斯特  听我说
Esther, listen to me.

402
00:39:23.644 --> 00:39:26.807
当大人们彼此非常非常相爱的时候...
When grown-ups love each other very, very much...

403
00:39:28.082 --> 00:39:30.778
他们就想要表示这种爱  把它表达出来
...they wanna show each other that love. Express it.

404
00:39:30.951 --> 00:39:32.248
我知道  他们就会操
I know. They fuck.

405
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.186
她一定在哪儿学到的  也许是学校
She could've picked it up anywhere. Probably at school.

406
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.091
这并不是她偶然听到的  我觉得她懂得其中的含义
This wasn't something she overheard. I mean, she knew what it meant.

407
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.793
而且  亲爱的  她说话的方式...
And, babe, the way she said it is...

408
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:50.801
我甚至觉得她都没有因为此事而感到烦恼
I don't even think she expected to get in trouble over it.

409
00:39:51.972 --> 00:39:55.567
好吧  今天晚上我们和她谈谈
Well, we'll talk to her about it tonight.

410
00:39:56.944 --> 00:39:58.502
好的
Fine.

411
00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:00.704
那么  你有什么想法
Well, what did you have in mind?

412
00:40:01.382 --> 00:40:04.351
没有  我想我们应该带她去布朗宁医生那里
No, I thought we could take her to Dr. Browning.

413
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.986
我觉得还没有带她去看心理医生的必要
I don't think we need to take her to the shrink quite yet.

414
00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:11.613
可是  我们还不很了解她
Well, you know, we just don't know that much about her.

415
00:40:11.792 --> 00:40:17.383
她所在的家庭就是吃饭的时候说着"把他妈的土豆拿开"
The family she stayed with "pass the fucking potatoes" at dinnertime,

416
00:40:17.383 --> 00:40:18.287
你知道吗
You know?

417
00:40:18.466 --> 00:40:21.867
如果她当着我的面会这么说  我们不在的时候她又会说什么
If she's saying it to my face, what is she saying when we're not there?

418
00:40:22.036 --> 00:40:25.164
我可不想让她的这种思想影响到麦可思
I don't want her exerting that kind of influence over Max.

419
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.710
不管怎样  我可不希望这一个词会惹出大麻烦
Anyway, I just don't want to make a big deal out of one little dirty word.

420
00:40:32.746 --> 00:40:35.977
好  你他妈就跟她耗时间吧
Fine. Fucking spend some time with her, then.

421
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.344
没错  泼妇
All right, bitch.

422
00:40:41.722 --> 00:40:44.156
我们去打雪仗吧
Let's have a snow fight!

423
00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:47.619
快来  别扔雪球
come on, no throwing snowballs.

424
00:40:58.172 --> 00:40:59.196
你好  老邻居
Hey, neighbor.

425
00:41:01.275 --> 00:41:04.676
好久没见到你了
Haven't seen you around lately.

426
00:41:04.845 --> 00:41:06.676
我最近特别忙
I've been pretty busy.

427
00:41:06.847 --> 00:41:09.907
业主协会没有了我还能坚持吗
Has the homeowners' association been soldiering on without me?

428
00:41:10.084 --> 00:41:12.018
这不一样
It's not the same.

429
00:41:24.698 --> 00:41:28.065
其实  我想让你帮个忙
Um, actually, I had a favor to ask.

430
00:41:28.235 --> 00:41:30.965
有把椅子我想把它搬到楼上...
I have a chair that I need moved upstairs...

431
00:41:31.172 --> 00:41:36.200
...我希望你哪天有空能顺便来帮我
...and I was hoping you could come by and help me with that sometime.

432
00:41:36.977 --> 00:41:38.444
好的
Yeah.

433
00:41:38.612 --> 00:41:40.409
-好的  当然   -谢谢
- Yeah, sure. - Good.

434
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.550
也许我和凯特可以帮得上忙  告诉我们就行
Maybe Kate and I could help you out. Just let us know.

435
00:41:43.717 --> 00:41:45.309
我会告诉你的
I'll call you.

436
00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:47.420
走吧  宝贝
Let's go, honey.

437
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.317
好的  我看着你呢
Okay, I'm watching you.

438
00:44:05.926 --> 00:44:10.090
布伦达的爸爸说是你把她退下去的
Brenda's father says that you pushed her.

439
00:44:10.264 --> 00:44:11.754
不是的
That's not true.

440
00:44:11.932 --> 00:44:13.422
我们只是在玩
We were just playing.

441
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.761
我发誓
I swear.

442
00:44:17.104 --> 00:44:19.368
-好  -你看到发生什么了吗
- Okay. - And did you see what happened?

443
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.338
她滑倒了

444
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:56.338
什么  妈妈  她在说什么
What? Mom, what's she saying?

445
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.138
她想让你把面包和黄油递过去
She wants you to pass the bread and butter.

446
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:03.743
没问你
Wasn't asking you.

447
00:45:13.761 --> 00:45:15.786
你能正常点吃吗
Can you eat normal?

448
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.454
我吃得很正常
I am eating normal.

449
00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:21.624
是的  可能在特兰西瓦尼亚  或者你来的那个国家算正常的
Yeah, maybe in Transylvania, or whatever country you're from.

450
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:23.827
顺便说一下  我是从俄罗斯来的
Incidentally, I'm from Russia.

451
00:45:24.004 --> 00:45:28.464
特兰西瓦尼亚并不是一个国家  它是罗马尼亚的一部分
Transylvania isn't even a country. It's a part of Romania.

452
00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:30.007
你个怪胎
You are such a freak.

453
00:45:30.177 --> 00:45:32.042
丹尼
Hey, Danny.

454
00:45:32.212 --> 00:45:34.043
我可不想再听到你这么说话
I don't want any more talk like that.

455
00:45:34.214 --> 00:45:36.682
但为什么她能那么做呢
But why does she have to act like that?

456
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.011
所有朋友都笑话我  就是因为她
All my friends make fun of me because of her.

457
00:45:39.186 --> 00:45:40.949
也许你需要不同的朋友
Maybe you need different friends.

458
00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:44.056
也许你需要把她送回孤儿院
Maybe you should send her back to the retard camp.

459
00:45:44.224 --> 00:45:45.851
-丹尼尔   -丹尼尔
- Daniel. - Daniel.

460
00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:47.550
和你妹妹道歉
Apologize to your sister.

461
00:45:47.728 --> 00:45:51.459
她他妈才不是我妹妹
She's not my fucking sister.

462
00:45:54.134 --> 00:45:55.431
我来解决
I got it.

463
00:45:57.538 --> 00:45:59.233
好吧
Okay.

464
00:46:01.809 --> 00:46:02.833
我来
That's me.

465
00:46:20.894 --> 00:46:23.158
你道歉了就能拿回钥匙
You get the key back when you say you're sorry.

466
00:46:29.536 --> 00:46:32.562
今天晚上想让我做什么好吃的呢
Is there anything special you want me to make tonight?

467
00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:34.229
你爱吃什么
You have any favorites?

468
00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:39.509
喂
Hello.

469
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.047
-你还好吗  -我们很好  我们相处很好
- Well, how are you? - Hi, we're great. We're doing good.

470
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:45.048
-她怎么样   -她就在这儿  等等
- How is she? - She's here, hold on.

471
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.949
是阿比盖尔修女  你想和她问个好吗
Hey, sister Abigail. Do you wanna say hello?

472
00:46:48.121 --> 00:46:52.114
-来吧  艾斯特  只是很快地问个好   -我说了  不要
- Come on. Esther, just quickly say hi. - I said, no.

473
00:46:55.762 --> 00:47:00.893
亲爱的  能帮我装5个苹果吗
You know what, do you mind, darling, can you get five apples for me?

474
00:47:01.535 --> 00:47:04.231
对不起  她突然变得很害羞
Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden.

475
00:47:04.404 --> 00:47:06.804
没关系  我只是想提醒你...
It's all right. I'm just calling to remind you...

476
00:47:07.007 --> 00:47:09.237
我的监督报告需要她的...
...that I'm gonna need her medical...

477
00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:12.105
内科和牙科表格
...and dental charts for my supervision report.

478
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:13.555
她在说什么

479
00:47:15.883 --> 00:47:17.817
她不喜欢牙医
She's not thrilled about the dentist.

480
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.999
她在谈论你

481
00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:24.880
大家相处怎么样  她对你们开口了吗
How is everyone doing? Is she opening up to you?

482
00:47:25.058 --> 00:47:28.516
我就猜到你会问这个  几个星期之前她给我出了个难题
I guess you can say that. She dropped the f-bomb on me a few weeks ago.

483
00:47:29.058 --> 00:47:30.516
"难题"是什么

484
00:47:31.565 --> 00:47:33.260
我猜她最后一定会逃出她的外壳
I guess she's finally coming out of her shell.

485
00:47:34.835 --> 00:47:36.496
是的
Yeah.

486
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.433
还有其他事要告诉我的吗
Any other glitches I should know of?

487
00:47:38.605 --> 00:47:40.129
目前我们出现一个大问题
We had a big one recently.

488
00:47:40.307 --> 00:47:42.332
学校里有个叫布伦达的女孩
It's a girl named Brenda at school.

489
00:47:42.807 --> 00:47:44.332
她在说布伦达的事儿

490
00:47:44.678 --> 00:47:48.079
她们在操场的一架滑梯上玩  她掉了下来
They were at the playground, there was a slide, well, she fell off.

491
00:47:48.248 --> 00:47:51.513
艾斯特可能推了她
Esther may have pushed her down.

492
00:47:51.685 --> 00:47:54.279
我不想让事情严重化  但是她受伤了
I'm not getting the story straight, but she got hurt.

493
00:47:54.454 --> 00:47:55.478
她还好吗
Is she all right?

494
00:47:55.656 --> 00:47:58.853
还算走运  她伤了踝关节还缝了6针
Luckily. She broke her ankle and had something like six stitches.

495
00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:00.651
听起来不怎么走运
That doesn't sound too lucky.

496
00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:03.159
是啊  幸好没有伤到脖子
Well, she's lucky she didn't break her neck.

497
00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:35.555
你和我说过你不会弹的
You told me you didn't know how to play.

498
00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:38.323
-不  我没说  -说了  你说了
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

499
00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:41.399
是你主动教我的  而我接受了
You offered to teach me and I accepted.

500
00:48:41.602 --> 00:48:47.006
好的  所以你一直都在装
Okay. So then you were just pretending this whole time?

501
00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:49.142
我以为你很喜欢教我
I thought you would enjoy teaching me.

502
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:53.211
对于一个像你这样热爱音乐的人...
It must be frustrating for someone who loves music as much as you...

503
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:57.214
子女对音乐毫无兴趣是一件多么沮丧的事
...to have a son who isn't interested and a daughter who can't even hear.

504
00:49:02.556 --> 00:49:04.649
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

505
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.688
我进去的时候她完美地弹着柴可夫斯基的曲子
I walk in on her playing Tchaikovsky without a mistake.

506
00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:12.161
她一直都在骗我
I mean, she's been lying to me this whole time.

507
00:49:12.332 --> 00:49:15.199
她只是想让你陪她  这不算撒谎
She just wants to spend time with you. It's hardly a lie.

508
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:16.393
你根本不懂
You wouldn't know.

509
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.164
你不懂  她在你面前总是表现得很好
You wouldn't. She's on her best behavior with you.

510
00:49:19.339 --> 00:49:22.399
在我面前却截然相反
She's completely different with me.

511
00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:24.339
那么  你想说什么
So, what are you saying?

512
00:49:24.511 --> 00:49:26.877
我也不知道  她在学校大发脾气
I don't know. She threw a fit at school.

513
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.844
她把布伦达推到地上
She pushed Brenda at the playground.

514
00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:31.788
-现在你的意思是那是她的错?  -我也不知道
- Now you're saying that was her fault? - I don't know.

515
00:49:31.788 --> 00:49:32.918
亲爱的  我也不知道
Honey, I don't know.

516
00:49:33.086 --> 00:49:35.384
我并不在场  你看着她们的
I wasn't there. You were watching them.

517
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:39.116
亲爱的  那是场意外
Oh, come on. It was an accident.

518
00:49:39.292 --> 00:49:42.523
好  我们什么都不要责怪她  好吗
Okay, let's not blame her for anything, fine.

519
00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:44.357
我以后所有事情都相信她
I'll take her word for everything.

520
00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:47.625
我也应该相信她说的关于你和乔伊斯的话吗
Should I just believe what she said about you and Joyce too?

521
00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:49.735
她说什么了
What did she say?

522
00:49:50.604 --> 00:49:54.472
-她说你爱上她了  -什么
- She says that you were hitting on her. - What?

523
00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:58.270
拜托  她一定误会了  那是...
Oh, come on. She must've misunderstood. It was, like...

524
00:49:58.445 --> 00:49:59.776
她请你过去的吗
Did she invite you over?

525
00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:03.109
她叫我帮她搬椅子
She asked me to help her move a chair.

526
00:50:03.283 --> 00:50:07.310
-她叫你了  -是的  但我拒绝了
- She did? - Yeah. I blew her off

527
00:50:07.487 --> 00:50:09.887
天哪
Oh, God.

528
00:50:10.057 --> 00:50:11.251
你怎么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:13.256
-我...  -这真是可笑
- I... - We could've laughed about it.

530
00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:15.224
-不  我知道...  -你想掩饰
- No, I knew how... - You were hiding it.

531
00:50:15.395 --> 00:50:17.795
亲爱的  我知道你会生气
Honey, I knew how you'd react.

532
00:50:17.964 --> 00:50:20.159
凯特  凯特
Kate. Kate.

533
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:23.166
你别像其他女人一样满腹猜疑好吗
You can't get jealous of every woman that I talk to, right?

534
00:50:23.336 --> 00:50:25.668
-已经将近10年了   -那又怎样
- It's been like 10 years. - What does that mean?

535
00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:28.000
你这么说代表这的确意味着什么
You say that like it actually means something.

536
00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:30.574
你才刚告诉我2年
It's only been two years since you told me.

537
00:50:30.744 --> 00:50:35.613
你知道我有多对不起你  我只想赢得一点信任
You know how sorry I am. I just feel like I've earned a little trust here.

538
00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:39.479
-我已经给你第二次机会了   -那不公平  那不公平
- I gave you a second chance. - That's not fair. That's not fair.

539
00:50:39.653 --> 00:50:42.850
我直说吧  我们谈论的是我的错  不是你的
Let me get this straight. We can talk about my mistakes, not yours?

540
00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:46.515
真让我恶心  你就是个想上其他人的白痴
I was sick! You were an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else!

541
00:50:46.727 --> 00:50:49.025
你置我们孩子的安危于不顾
You put our child's life in danger.

542
00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:52.198
我应该离开几个月  就没人再责备我了
I could've walked away months ago. Nobody would've blamed me.

543
00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:56.825
很干脆  很干脆  你从哪儿学来的  你妈那儿吗
Oh, that's sharp. That's sharp. Where did you get that from, your mother?

544
00:51:11.104 --> 00:51:14.213
丹尼  声音关小点  拜托  我要工作
Danny. Turn that crap down, please, I gotta work.

545
00:51:14.387 --> 00:51:15.445
-好吧  -谢谢
- Fine. - Thank you.

546
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.022
我去开
I'll get it.

547
00:51:27.534 --> 00:51:31.061
-你好  艾斯特  -你来这儿干吗
- Hello, Esther. - What are you doing here?

548
00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:33.330
我可以进去吗
May I come in?

549
00:51:33.507 --> 00:51:36.874
恐怕我犯了一个错误
I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.

550
00:51:37.043 --> 00:51:39.170
艾斯特可能有点问题
There could be something wrong with Esther.

551
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:40.540
什么
What?

552
00:51:40.714 --> 00:51:43.808
什么  你说过她一点问题都没有的
What? You told us that you'd never had any trouble with her.

553
00:51:43.984 --> 00:51:47.249
是的  但麻烦是会找上她的
I didn't. But trouble does have a way of finding her.

554
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.478
什么样的麻烦
What kind of trouble?

555
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:52.185
两个女孩打架  她是其中一个
Two girls get into a fight, there she is.

556
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:55.021
有人偷东西被抓  她又在其中
Someone gets caught stealing, there she is again.

557
00:51:55.195 --> 00:51:57.390
-那么  意思就是...  -让她说完
- So? Does that mean...? - Just let her finish.

558
00:51:57.564 --> 00:52:00.371
你告诉我摔到地上那个女孩的事之后
After you told me about the girl in the playground,

559
00:52:00.371 --> 00:52:01.830
我给她以前的学校打了电话
I called her old school.

560
00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:04.436
她在那儿的时候  有一个男孩...
While she was there, there was a boy...

561
00:52:04.604 --> 00:52:06.572
手里拿着剪子...
...who fell with scissors in his hand...

562
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.368
并且突然刺穿了自己的下巴
...and accidentally stabbed himself through the jaw.

563
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:11.033
当时艾斯特也在场
And Esther was there again.

564
00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:14.578
我不明白  他突然刺伤了他自己
I don't understand. He accidentally stabbed himself.

565
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:18.184
但是最大的麻烦是苏利文房屋的火灾
But the most troubling thing is the Sullivan house fire.

566
00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:21.377
我做了进一步调查  那是纵火
I checked into it further. It was arson.

567
00:52:22.422 --> 00:52:24.788
他们一直都没查出谁是凶手
They have never found the person who did it.

568
00:52:24.958 --> 00:52:26.949
你有什么建议
What are you suggesting here?

569
00:52:27.127 --> 00:52:29.459
她与这些事情有什么联系
That she had anything to do with any of this?

570
00:52:29.629 --> 00:52:30.926
这太可笑了
It's ridiculous.

571
00:52:31.097 --> 00:52:33.088
一个孩子能够做出这种违法的事...
That a child could commit such crimes...

572
00:52:33.266 --> 00:52:35.131
我相信这只是表面现象
...it flies in the face of everything I believe.

573
00:52:35.335 --> 00:52:36.768
是的
Well, yeah.

574
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:46.278
来了一个可恶的女人  她要把我带走
There's a mean lady here. She's come to take me away.

575
00:52:46.446 --> 00:52:48.414
你能帮我吗
Will you help me?

576
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:52.211
我们有一些行为问题  但是...
We've had some behavioral problems, but...

577
00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:55.047
是的  不会是那样的  是吧
Yeah, nothing like that. I mean, right?

578
00:52:55.222 --> 00:52:57.918
是的  真的  考虑一下吧
Yes, we have. Really, hon, think about it.

579
00:52:58.091 --> 00:53:01.788
我会试着联系那家她长大的俄罗斯孤儿院
I've tried to reach the Russian orphanage where she was raised.

580
00:53:01.962 --> 00:53:04.556
我们需要知道该怎么办
I think we need to know what we're dealing with.

581
00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:07.222
好的  我会告诉你们该怎么办
Well, I'll tell you what we're dealing with.

582
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.459
-不...  -别说话  听着
- No, you know what? - Stop it. Listen.

583
00:53:09.636 --> 00:53:12.799
我们在对待一个9岁的孤儿  明白吗
We're dealing with a 9-year-old girl who's an orphan, okay?

584
00:53:12.973 --> 00:53:17.000
-我们要带她去看布朗宁医生  -我们带她去看布朗宁医生
- We're taking her to Dr. Browning. - We can take her to Dr. Browning.

585
00:53:20.973 --> 00:53:23.800
找到树屋的钥匙

586
00:54:14.434 --> 00:54:16.026
你想玩吗
Do you want to play?

587
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.972
一旦我查出来就会立刻给你电话
I'll call you as soon as I find anything else out.

588
00:54:26.146 --> 00:54:28.706
-好的  保重  -好的  非常感谢
- Right. Take care.  - Okay. Thank you very much.

589
00:54:28.882 --> 00:54:30.543
待会儿再说
Maybe later.

590
00:54:51.504 --> 00:54:52.528
会没事的
It's going to be fine.

591

我们要把她吓得再也不敢来
We'll scare her so bad she'll never come back here.

592

她来了
Here she comes.

593
00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:07.577
挥舞你的手臂让她停下
Wave your arms and make her stop.

我什么都没看到  我发誓

求你了...
Please...

620
01:00:02.482 --> 01:00:06.435
如果我发现你说谎
If I find out that you're lying, I'll cut your hairless little prick off..

621
01:00:06.719 --> 01:00:09.517
我会让你连怎么死的都不知道
...before you even figure out what it's for.

622
01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:13.491
-明白了吗  -明白了
- Do you understand me? - Yes.

623
01:00:16.896 --> 01:00:18.523

-我们很快就出来  亲爱的  -你一会儿再进来
- We'll be right out, honey. - You can come on in.

627
01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:49.384

My initial instinct is that...

628
01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:53.361
艾斯特的过去没有什么太大的问题
...there's not a deeply-rooted problem in Esther's past.

629
01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:58.093
-她没有问题  -是的
- So there's nothing wrong with her? - No.

630
01:01:01.273 --> 01:01:04.140
这不全是好消息  我认为艾斯特和身边人的关系...
It's not all good news. I think what needs to be examined...

631
01:01:04.343 --> 01:01:07.870
还是需要考察的
...is Esther's relationship with those around her.
