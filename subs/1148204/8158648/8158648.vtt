1
00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.353
Hang on. I know.

2
00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:55.420
Mm.

3
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.750
You're doing so good.

4
00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.653
You're doing so good.
You all right?

5
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.452
- Yeah.
- Okay.

6
00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.459
Dr. Matthews to the nurses' station.

7
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.187
Excuse me.

8
00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:10.354
My wife's in labor.
We called ahead for Dr. Wheeler.

9
00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:12.555
I just need you to fill this out, please.

10
00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.060
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, hon.

11
00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.060
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, hon.

12
00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:27.864
- Okay?
- Okay.

13
00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.671
- Is this your first?
- No, no, it's our third.

14
00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:33.835
Sir, can you sign here?

15
00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.703
We're gonna name her Jessica.

16
00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.703
We're gonna name her Jessica.

17
00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:15.568
Where's John?

18
00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.201
- Where's my husband?
- Just relax now.

19
00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.802
Everything's gonna be okay.

20
00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:28.737
What's happening?
What are you doing?

21
00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.307
I'm so sorry for your loss.

22
00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:32.569
- What?
- Your baby's dead.

23
00:02:32.744 --> 00:02:34.973
No, it's not dead. It's alive.

24
00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:37.046
What are you talking about?
It's moving.

25
00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.341
It's a terrible loss. We're so sorry.

26
00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.983
- Just relax.
- No!

27
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:47.017
What? No, no, no. Put me to sleep.
I wanna be asleep.

28
00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:50.518
- It's too late for that.
- No!

29
00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:55.747
It's okay, you're doing great.

30
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.592
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31
00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.386
You might feel some tugging.

32
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.057
Oh, my God. This isn't happening.

33
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:14.157
Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman.
It's a girl.

34
00:04:29.777 --> 00:04:33.268
Yes, Kate, your dreams can be
a manifestation of your emotions.

35
00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.605
It's your body and mind's way
of dealing...

36
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.270
...with the stress and grief
of what happened.

37
00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:41.143
What if this has nothing to do
with the stillbirth?

38
00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:43.216
What do you think it's about?

39
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.819
We're seeing kids
for the first time this weekend.

40
00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:51.444
And maybe the nightmares...

41
00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:58.557
Maybe I'm just not ready to adopt yet.

42
00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:08.093
I drove by the wine shop
on the way home the other night.

43
00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.827
Did you stop?

44
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.832
No. Wanted to. The thought
went through my brain, you know?

45
00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:16.936
It wasn't for myself. It wasn't...

46
00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:21.060
I just thought it would be nice to have
a bottle handy, in case we had guests.

47
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:22.467
But you didn't go in.

48
00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:26.438
Mm-mm.

49
00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:28.633
The key, to me...

50
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.244
...is not that you had the urge...

51
00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:33.072
...but that you resisted it.

52
00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.146
You wouldn't have made it through
the home study if you weren't ready.

53
00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:38.782
But, ultimately...

54
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.417
...you have to decide.

55
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:06.321
Hi.

56
00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:10.527
Honey, hello.

57
00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:13.258
Let me see. Ooh. Did you paint this?

58
00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:18.263
It's a beautiful butterfly.
It's fantastic.

59
00:06:18.438 --> 00:06:20.530
Really wonderful. Good.

60
00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:23.730
Let's go. I'm cold.

61
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.252
Are you okay?

62
00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:14.793
Ah!

63
00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.067
Max!

64
00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:22.901
Max!

65
00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:24.769
Stop throwing!

66
00:08:24.942 --> 00:08:27.739
I'm working.

67
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.073
No, honey, I'm sorry.

68
00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:32.770
Just take a break
for a little while, okay?

69
00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:36.005
Because Mommy's trying
to play. Okay?

70
00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:42.217
Daddy's here.

71
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:47.253
- Mine.
- Hey.

72
00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:50.949
- Hi.
- Sorry, practice went a little late.

73
00:08:51.123 --> 00:08:53.590
- It's all right.
- Whoa.

74
00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:57.326
- Okay, tough guy. Give me that.
- Wicked.

75
00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:00.025
No, no.

76
00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:02.628
Shoot it, shoot it. Go, go, go, go.

77
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.526
- No.
- Yes! Give me five.

78
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.633
Hey, how did it go? Daniel.

79
00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:10.391
Fine.

80
00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:17.270
Hey.

81
00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:19.296
Okay.

82
00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:21.372
Five minutes. I'm at the last level.

83
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:23.303
No more video games. Brush your teeth.

84
00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:26.136
That's no fair. It won't save.
Come on, Dad, please?

85
00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:26.136
That's no fair. It won't save.
Come on, Dad, please?

86
00:11:54.226 --> 00:11:56.625
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

87
00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:57.989
God.

88
00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:04.661
You smell good.

89
00:12:16.505 --> 00:12:18.063
Okay.

90
00:12:19.307 --> 00:12:21.331
All right.

91
00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:28.343
I have to stop being like this.

92
00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:30.206
I get it.

93
00:12:38.384 --> 00:12:42.342
I'm very excited, I'm happy.

94
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.846
I get nervous.

95
00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:47.881
I'm really scared.

96
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:55.883
Last time I felt all of this
was right before I lost the baby.

97
00:12:56.061 --> 00:12:59.586
I don't want you to feel like we have
to go through with this for my sake.

98
00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:03.095
It's not just... It's not for you.

99
00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.357
I wanna take the love
we felt for Jessica...

100
00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:09.491
...and I wanna give it to somebody
who really needs it.

101
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.838
Are you sure, hon?

102
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.200
Yes.

103
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.353
- Wanna make a snowman?
- Sure.

104
00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:44.919
It's really cold out here.

105
00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:53.352
Hey, stop it.

106
00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:02.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

107
00:14:02.632 --> 00:14:03.928
So glad you could make it.

108
00:14:04.099 --> 00:14:06.192
- So are we.
- Yeah, finally, right?

109
00:14:07.134 --> 00:14:10.363
- So good to see you.
- Thank you for coming.

110
00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:14.705
- This is really something.
- So go take a look around.

111
00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:17.799
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.573
Look at the snow orphan.

113
00:14:22.743 --> 00:14:24.107
Snow orphan?

114
00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:26.744
Uh, snorphan?

115
00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:41.149
- Hey.
- No, show it to Sister Mary.

116
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.299
- Slow down, slow down.
- You can't catch me.

117
00:15:07.468 --> 00:15:08.594
Yes, I can.

118
00:15:36.084 --> 00:15:37.812
Hello?

119
00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:43.777
Hi.

120
00:15:57.763 --> 00:15:59.594
Are all these paintings yours?

121
00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:03.493
- Yes. Do you like them?
- They're remarkable.

122
00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:05.665
Thank you.

123
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.666
My name is Esther. What's yours?

124
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.760
John. Nice to meet you.

125
00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.697
- Can I take a seat?
- Of course.

126
00:16:17.607 --> 00:16:20.700
I never get tired of watching
these kids enjoy the party.

127
00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:23.366
It really is. I'm so sorry
we didn't do this sooner.

128
00:16:23.578 --> 00:16:25.374
Don't be. It's a big leap.

129
00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:29.707
Adopting an older child
is not an easy decision to make.

130
00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:32.441
John's in the bathroom.

131
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.981
Think he'll find us?
Do you wanna go look for him?

132
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:39.984
- Where did you get the idea for this one?
- My paintings always tell stories.

133
00:16:40.154 --> 00:16:43.485
This one's about a sad mother lion
who can't find her cubs.

134
00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:47.090
- She's smiling.
- She's dreaming about her babies.

135
00:16:47.592 --> 00:16:49.524
It's the only thing
that makes her happy.

136
00:16:49.692 --> 00:16:54.094
- I hope she finds them.
- She will. Look.

137
00:16:57.297 --> 00:17:00.491
They were lost in the jungle,
and they were so scared...

138
00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:02.791
...because they didn't have a mother.

139
00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:05.366
Just when they thought
they'd be alone forever...

140
00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:09.162
...they found their mother asleep
under this tree.

141
00:17:09.337 --> 00:17:12.827
Now when she wakes up,
her dream will have come true.

142
00:17:13.005 --> 00:17:16.531
- She'll have her family again.
- Amazing. You came up with that story?

143
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:19.198
- I think I hear his voice down here.
- Yes.

144
00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.999
Hey. I want to introduce you.
This is my wife, Kate.

145
00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:25.543
Kate, this is Esther.

146
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.345
Hello.

147
00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.181
How are you? Nice to meet you.

148
00:17:34.217 --> 00:17:36.480
She painted all these.

149
00:17:36.652 --> 00:17:37.675
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:17:37.852 --> 00:17:40.581
These are fantastic.
These are really wonderful.

151
00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:43.153
- Thank you.
- Where did you learn how to do this?

152
00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:46.517
I've just had lots of time to practice,
I guess.

153
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.487
It's really boring here.

154
00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:51.649
It's boring here?

155
00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:54.488
If you're so bored,
why aren't you down at the party?

156
00:17:54.662 --> 00:17:59.324
I've never really seen the point of it.
Nobody's ever talked to me before.

157
00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:01.356
I guess I'm different.

158
00:18:01.532 --> 00:18:03.726
There's nothing wrong
with being different.

159
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.867
Well, you two have a lot in common.

160
00:18:10.437 --> 00:18:12.370
I think people should always...

161
00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:15.005
...try to take the bad things
that happen to them...

162
00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:17.538
...and turn them into something good.

163
00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:20.504
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

164
00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:22.576
Absolutely.

165
00:18:29.248 --> 00:18:32.738
She's originally from Russia, but
it's amazing how strong her English is.

166
00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:35.213
She's only been in the country
a few years.

167
00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:37.409
You get children from other countries?

168
00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:41.749
It's rare. But when we do,
it's sometimes difficult to place them.

169
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:46.086
The family that brought her to America
died in a house fire.

170
00:18:46.257 --> 00:18:47.690
In a fire?

171
00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:49.257
My God.

172
00:18:49.426 --> 00:18:50.950
Esther barely got out.

173
00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:56.253
She's been through a lot,
but this is an extraordinary little girl.

174
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.398
She's very bright.
She's very mature for her age.

175
00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:03.693
And she's very well-mannered.
She's a bit of a princess, actually.

176
00:19:03.868 --> 00:19:07.666
She wears those ribbons on her wrists
and her neck all the time.

177
00:19:08.302 --> 00:19:09.360
Mine too.

178
00:19:09.537 --> 00:19:12.300
We had trouble with her
when we tried to take them off.

179
00:19:12.472 --> 00:19:14.302
How does she get along
with other kids?

180
00:19:14.473 --> 00:19:16.737
Oh, when she has to interact,
she's great.

181
00:19:16.908 --> 00:19:19.034
Babe?

182
00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:22.405
- She really did seem to open up with us.
- Yeah.

183
00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:25.374
I thought she more
than opened up with you.

184
00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:27.639
You seem to have made
quite a connection.

185
00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:31.976
I could get the paperwork together
and see you back here in three weeks.

186
00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:39.980
All right.

187
00:19:49.894 --> 00:19:50.952
Okey-dokey.

188
00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:53.151
Call me if you need anything.

189
00:19:53.328 --> 00:19:55.090
Bye. Okay, thank you.

190
00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:17.263
Oh, that's T-H.

191
00:20:17.442 --> 00:20:20.069
Yeah.

192
00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:22.335
And "Max" is like this?

193
00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:23.569
Yeah.

194
00:20:24.847 --> 00:20:26.437
Good.

195
00:20:30.783 --> 00:20:35.150
- Is this your house?
- Now it's your house too.

196
00:20:51.594 --> 00:20:55.461
Hi, sweetie. Hi. Look who's here.

197
00:21:00.499 --> 00:21:04.434
Hello, Max. My name is Esther.

198
00:21:05.001 --> 00:21:07.333
She's been practicing the whole way.

199
00:21:09.472 --> 00:21:11.496
- Can she hear?
- A little.

200
00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:13.469
She was born almost completely deaf.

201
00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.835
That just allows her to hear enough
to read lips.

202
00:21:20.377 --> 00:21:22.867
That's all right, I got it.

203
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:29.714
I'd like to introduce you
to Grandma Barbara.

204
00:21:29.883 --> 00:21:32.544
It's a pleasure to meet you.

205
00:21:32.752 --> 00:21:35.742
That's precious.
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

206
00:21:37.487 --> 00:21:39.386
Danny.

207
00:21:39.554 --> 00:21:41.749
This is Esther.

208
00:21:43.858 --> 00:21:45.051
Hello, Daniel.

209
00:21:46.258 --> 00:21:47.986
Hey.

210
00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:53.492
Why does she dress like that?

211
00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:56.824
- Come on. Stop it.
- I'm just asking a question.

212
00:21:56.998 --> 00:21:58.897
Oh!

213
00:21:59.665 --> 00:22:02.656
- You have a piano?
- Yeah.

214
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:05.961
- Would you like to learn how to play?
- I would love to.

215
00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.231
Do you like it?

216
00:22:16.408 --> 00:22:18.569
- It's perfect.
- Good.

217
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:27.343
Thank you.

218
00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:29.380
How do you say "thank you"?

219
00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.350
Thank you.

220
00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:43.551
Wow, look at that.

221
00:22:43.724 --> 00:22:46.715
What? What? What?

222
00:22:46.893 --> 00:22:48.154
Dad, look.

223
00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.850
- Dad.
- Where did you get that?

224
00:22:50.028 --> 00:22:53.019
- Dad, look, I'm killing Trevor.
- Great.

225
00:22:53.196 --> 00:22:54.686
Yes.

226
00:22:57.698 --> 00:22:58.994
Thank you.

227
00:22:59.166 --> 00:23:01.600
Come on, Dad. My solo's gonna end.
Hurry, look.

228
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:05.102
Wow, cool.

229
00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:12.600
- Trevor, you suck.
- Shut up.

230
00:23:14.175 --> 00:23:16.574
That's fabulous.

231
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.109
Come on, guys. This is lame.

232
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:22.540
I was just about to beat you.

233
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:25.844
I'm glad you like it, honey.

234
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.352
Come on, guys.

235
00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:52.192
Hurry up, I'm freezing my ass off.

236
00:23:52.362 --> 00:23:57.093
- Dude, it's all in here.
- Oh, God. My hands are freezing.

237
00:23:57.899 --> 00:23:59.365
Oh, man, she's hot.

238
00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:02.858
- Move over, man.
- Page 34 will change your life.

239
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:06.065
Whoa.

240
00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:08.532
This looks like your mom.

241
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.271
No.

242
00:24:16.943 --> 00:24:19.240
Esther and Maxine seem to be
getting along well.

243
00:24:19.411 --> 00:24:20.605
Yeah.

244
00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:22.473
How's she doing, Kate?

245
00:24:22.646 --> 00:24:24.977
Esther's fitting right in.

246
00:24:25.148 --> 00:24:26.774
I meant Maxine.

247
00:24:26.949 --> 00:24:29.576
She's playing by the pond
like nothing ever happened.

248
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.410
She doesn't remember, does she?

249
00:24:31.585 --> 00:24:33.984
No. She's fine.

250
00:24:38.888 --> 00:24:42.550
So, what are your plans?

251
00:24:42.724 --> 00:24:45.749
You know,probably get Esther settled...

252
00:24:46.594 --> 00:24:48.561
...then go back to teaching.

253
00:24:48.728 --> 00:24:50.660
Thought they weren't gonna
take you back.

254
00:24:50.862 --> 00:24:52.329
No, I'm not talking about Yale.

255
00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:55.588
I'll just... I'll probably give lessons
from home.

256
00:24:55.764 --> 00:24:58.130
That's too bad.
That was a very good job.

257
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.267
Well, I didn't quit because I wanted to.

258
00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:03.596
I know.
You had to have your moment of clarity.

259
00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:06.293
That is an A.A. term.

260
00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:09.335
And I didn't go to A.A.
I just stopped drinking.

261
00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:13.098
Same difference.
We all need a wake-up call sometimes.

262
00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:21.803
Hi.

263
00:26:22.713 --> 00:26:25.806
- Hi.
- Come here.

264
00:26:43.926 --> 00:26:45.552
Yeah?

265
00:26:47.327 --> 00:26:50.625
- Oh, hey.
- We're scared of the lightning.

266
00:26:50.796 --> 00:26:52.490
Oh, come in.

267
00:26:53.298 --> 00:26:58.289
- I wanna sleep next to Daddy.
- Hang on.

268
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:01.330
Okay.

269
00:27:10.273 --> 00:27:12.638
I'm gonna call later,
make sure everything's okay.

270
00:27:12.808 --> 00:27:15.003
Okay. They're gonna love your design.

271
00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.041
- You gonna pick up the phone?
- Yeah.

272
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:18.801
All right.

273
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:21.509
Esther?

274
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.375
Esther?

275
00:27:23.548 --> 00:27:25.242
Come on.

276
00:27:25.449 --> 00:27:28.884
Esther, come on, we gotta go!

277
00:27:29.052 --> 00:27:32.348
You gotta be kidding me.

278
00:27:32.652 --> 00:27:35.848
Wow. Uh...

279
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.952
- Will you please go wait in the car?
- Come on.

280
00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:45.418
Sweetheart,this isn't really
a school dress.

281
00:27:45.593 --> 00:27:48.152
But I like it.
Don't you think it's pretty?

282
00:27:48.329 --> 00:27:49.920
Yes, it's so beautiful...

283
00:27:50.096 --> 00:27:53.188
...but I just don't think
you're gonna be comfortable in it.

284
00:27:53.364 --> 00:27:54.490
What about those jeans?

285
00:27:54.665 --> 00:27:57.531
You're afraid the other children
will laugh at me.

286
00:27:57.701 --> 00:28:02.159
I thought you said there wasn't
anything wrong with being different.

287
00:28:03.537 --> 00:28:05.868
Yes, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

288
00:28:06.038 --> 00:28:08.733
Okay. Have fun.

289
00:28:10.207 --> 00:28:12.766
Take a seat, please. Take a seat.

290
00:28:12.976 --> 00:28:15.102
Don't make me ask again, please.

291
00:28:16.043 --> 00:28:19.102
Okay, this is our new student.
Her name's Esther Coleman.

292
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.406
And I'd like you all
to make her feel very welcome today.

293
00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:26.016
Oh, look. Little Bo Peep texted me.
She wants her outfit back.

294
00:28:29.718 --> 00:28:31.413
Okay, go take a seat.

295
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:36.119
Okay, if everybody could turn
to Page 27...

296
00:28:41.024 --> 00:28:42.082
No!

297
00:28:42.258 --> 00:28:44.521
No! Esther, what are you doing?

298
00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:47.525
Get away from there! No!

299
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:51.561
You don't play near the water!
You know that!

300
00:28:51.731 --> 00:28:53.027
Come on, get out!

301
00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.259
Max.

302
00:29:13.609 --> 00:29:16.270
Sweet. Bull's-eye.

303
00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:18.871
Got you.

304
00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:55.730
- Did you kill it?
- I didn't think it would hurt him.

305
00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:06.905
Put it out of its misery.

306
00:30:08.574 --> 00:30:13.008
- It's in pain, and it's your responsibility.
- It was just an accident.

307
00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:15.507
If you walk away now,
it'll starve to death.

308
00:30:15.677 --> 00:30:17.234
Is that what you want?

309
00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:24.271
I'm not doing it.

310
00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:32.185
It's all right.

311
00:30:32.354 --> 00:30:35.082
- It's in heaven now.
- What's wrong with you?

312
00:30:42.926 --> 00:30:45.155
- Is the water warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.

313
00:30:45.327 --> 00:30:47.556
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

314
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:07.335
Esther?

315
00:31:08.174 --> 00:31:10.107
Esther.

316
00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:12.275
Open this door.

317
00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:18.772
- What are you doing?
- I always lock the door.

318
00:31:18.947 --> 00:31:20.776
No, we don't lock doors in this house.

319
00:31:20.947 --> 00:31:23.005
But what if someone comes in
and sees me?

320
00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:24.942
Nobody's gonna come in.

321
00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:28.142
Look, I'm gonna stand right here,
if that's what you want.

322
00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.842
I could sing for you.

323
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.351
I used to sing for the sisters
so they would know I was all right.

324
00:31:36.857 --> 00:31:38.619
Okay.

325
00:31:39.125 --> 00:31:42.581
All right. But you know what?
This is just for tonight.

326
00:33:28.252 --> 00:33:32.085
Your parents must have gone
to a lot of retard camps to find her.

327
00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:35.582
Watch it.

328
00:33:36.956 --> 00:33:38.548
Are you okay?

329
00:33:44.162 --> 00:33:45.719
Is this a Bible?

330
00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:51.424
Jesus Freak brought a Bible
to school today.

331
00:33:56.169 --> 00:33:57.533
Hey, wanna come over?

332
00:34:03.672 --> 00:34:06.265
- Good one.
- Your sister's a total spaz.

333
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.929
She's not my sister.

334
00:34:10.243 --> 00:34:12.038
I can't believe you did that.

335
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.906
Oh, little doggy.
Is this your collar, little doggy?

336
00:34:31.755 --> 00:34:35.814
Not A. A, B.

337
00:34:41.993 --> 00:34:43.585
You did really good.

338
00:34:43.762 --> 00:34:47.786
No, I didn't. I made like 11 mistakes.

339
00:34:49.198 --> 00:34:50.721
I'll do better next time.

340
00:34:51.432 --> 00:34:54.298
Your teacher told me
what happened today.

341
00:34:55.936 --> 00:34:58.459
Don't you want to talk about it?

342
00:34:58.636 --> 00:35:00.830
There's nothing to talk about.

343
00:35:01.438 --> 00:35:04.338
You know I'm here for you, right?
You know that, right?

344
00:35:05.574 --> 00:35:08.337
I got something I wanna show you.

345
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:15.308
I have one just like this
that I use as a diary.

346
00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:19.345
And I thought that maybe you
and I could use this one...

347
00:35:19.515 --> 00:35:21.141
...for a scrapbook.

348
00:35:22.516 --> 00:35:25.006
That's Mommy and Daddy
on their wedding day.

349
00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:28.852
That's Daniel, Christmas morning.

350
00:35:30.088 --> 00:35:31.986
Here's Max.

351
00:35:34.723 --> 00:35:35.951
And there's you.

352
00:35:41.528 --> 00:35:43.585
Who's Jessica?

353
00:35:44.828 --> 00:35:47.523
Max talks about her.

354
00:35:48.364 --> 00:35:51.355
"I never held you, but I feel you.

355
00:35:51.533 --> 00:35:55.297
You never spoke, but I hear you.

356
00:35:56.668 --> 00:36:01.468
I never knew you, but I love you."

357
00:36:06.808 --> 00:36:08.434
What happened to her?

358
00:36:11.277 --> 00:36:13.836
She died
while she was still in my tummy.

359
00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:17.106
But we scattered her ashes here.

360
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.115
And as long as this plant grows...

361
00:36:21.283 --> 00:36:25.980
...then part of her
will be alive inside it.

362
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.651
She would have been lucky.

363
00:36:36.825 --> 00:36:38.655
You're a great mommy.

364
00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:46.887
Thank you, sweetheart.

365
00:36:47.064 --> 00:36:49.827
Thank you. It means a lot.

366
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.461
- How are you?
- I'm good.

367
00:36:56.636 --> 00:37:00.969
It's very interesting.
Esther started to open up today.

368
00:37:01.139 --> 00:37:02.332
That's very interesting.

369
00:37:02.506 --> 00:37:04.995
I'm starting to feel like
there's a real connection.

370
00:37:05.173 --> 00:37:07.197
Me too.

371
00:37:10.076 --> 00:37:12.203
- No, honey, not here.
- Shh.

372
00:37:12.379 --> 00:37:13.868
They're sleeping.

373
00:37:14.046 --> 00:37:17.912
Baby, come here,
you'll like it, believe me.

374
00:37:24.485 --> 00:37:26.714
- Okay, let's get down to business.
- No, no, no.

375
00:37:26.886 --> 00:37:29.910
Okay, just for a second, then.

376
00:37:30.087 --> 00:37:31.714
Yeah.

377
00:37:41.061 --> 00:37:42.652
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

378
00:37:42.828 --> 00:37:46.092
I have to. Wait, wait, wait.

379
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.531
Yeah.

380
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:24.540
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

381
00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:42.425
Oh, Jesus.

382
00:38:43.063 --> 00:38:46.224
Jesus, honey. Damn it.

383
00:38:52.134 --> 00:38:53.828
Esther?

384
00:38:55.236 --> 00:38:57.567
We have to talk about last night.

385
00:38:57.737 --> 00:39:00.569
- Do we?
- Yes, we do.

386
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.769
See, there are certain things
that grown-ups do...

387
00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:09.034
...that children aren't supposed to see.

388
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:13.235
And that was one of them.

389
00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:19.609
Esther, listen to me.

390
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:27.113
When grown-ups love each other
very, very much...

391
00:39:28.388 --> 00:39:31.083
...they wanna show each other
that love. Express it.

392
00:39:31.256 --> 00:39:32.551
I know. They fuck.

393
00:39:36.792 --> 00:39:39.487
She could've picked it up anywhere.
Probably at school.

394
00:39:39.661 --> 00:39:43.391
This wasn't something she overheard.
I mean, she knew what it meant.

395
00:39:43.563 --> 00:39:44.756
Huh.

396
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.090
And, babe,
the way she said it is...

397
00:39:47.264 --> 00:39:51.097
I don't even think she expected
to get in trouble over it.

398
00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:55.860
Well, we'll talk to her about it tonight.

399
00:39:57.237 --> 00:39:58.794
Fine.

400
00:39:58.971 --> 00:40:00.995
Well, what did you have in mind?

401
00:40:01.673 --> 00:40:04.641
No, I thought we could take her
to Dr. Browning.

402
00:40:05.409 --> 00:40:08.274
I don't think we need to take her
to the shrink quite yet.

403
00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:11.900
Well, you know,
we just don't know that much about her.

404
00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:14.444
The family she stayed with
could've been like:

405
00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:18.570
"Pass the fucking potatoes"
at dinnertime, you know?

406
00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.149
If she's saying it to my face, what
is she saying when we're not there?

407
00:40:22.318 --> 00:40:25.445
I don't want her exerting
that kind of influence over Max.

408
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.988
Anyway, I just don't want to make
a big deal out of one little dirty word.

409
00:40:33.023 --> 00:40:36.253
Fine. Fucking spend some time
with her, then.

410
00:40:36.426 --> 00:40:37.620
All right, bitch.

411
00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:44.428
Let's have a snow fight!

412
00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:47.890
Come on, no throwing snowballs.

413
00:40:58.438 --> 00:40:59.462
Hey, neighbor.

414
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.939
- Hey.
- Haven't seen you around lately.

415
00:41:05.108 --> 00:41:06.938
JOHN:
I've been pretty busy.

416
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:10.168
Has the homeowners' association
been soldiering on without me?

417
00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:12.278
It's not the same.

418
00:41:24.953 --> 00:41:28.318
Um, actually, I had a favor to ask.

419
00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:31.217
I have a chair
that I need moved upstairs...

420
00:41:31.424 --> 00:41:36.450
...and I was hoping you could come by
and help me with that sometime.

421
00:41:37.227 --> 00:41:38.692
Yeah.

422
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.656
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

423
00:41:40.828 --> 00:41:43.796
Maybe Kate and I could help you out.
Just let us know.

424
00:41:43.963 --> 00:41:45.555
I'll call you.

425
00:41:45.732 --> 00:41:47.665
Let's go, honey.

426
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.559
Okay, I'm watching you.

427
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.272
Brenda's father says
that you pushed her.

428
00:44:10.446 --> 00:44:11.935
That's not true.

429
00:44:12.113 --> 00:44:13.603
We were just playing.

430
00:44:13.781 --> 00:44:15.941
I swear.

431
00:44:17.283 --> 00:44:19.546
- Okay.
- And did you see what happened?

432
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.500
What? Mom, what's she saying?

433
00:44:56.672 --> 00:44:59.299
She wants you to pass the bread
and butter.

434
00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:03.902
- Wasn't asking you.
- Hey, now.

435
00:45:13.915 --> 00:45:15.939
Can you eat normal?

436
00:45:17.116 --> 00:45:18.606
I am eating normal.

437
00:45:18.784 --> 00:45:21.775
Yeah, maybe in Transylvania,
or whatever country you're from.

438
00:45:21.953 --> 00:45:23.977
Incidentally, I'm from Russia.

439
00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:28.611
Transylvania isn't even a country.
It's a part of Romania.

440
00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:30.154
You are such a freak.

441
00:45:30.324 --> 00:45:32.188
- Hey.
- Hey, Danny.

442
00:45:32.358 --> 00:45:34.188
I don't want any more talk like that.

443
00:45:34.359 --> 00:45:36.826
But why does she have to act
like that?

444
00:45:36.994 --> 00:45:39.154
All my friends make fun of me
because of her.

445
00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:41.091
Maybe you need different friends.

446
00:45:41.263 --> 00:45:44.197
Maybe you should send her back
to the retard camp.

447
00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:45.991
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

448
00:45:46.166 --> 00:45:47.690
Apologize to your sister.

449
00:45:47.868 --> 00:45:51.596
She's not my fucking sister.

450
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.567
I got it.

451
00:45:57.673 --> 00:45:59.367
Okay.

452
00:46:01.942 --> 00:46:02.965
That's me.

453
00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:23.282
You get the key back
when you say you're sorry.

454
00:46:29.657 --> 00:46:32.682
Is there anything special
you want me to make tonight?

455
00:46:32.859 --> 00:46:34.348
You have any favorites?

456
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:39.625
Hello.

457
00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:43.162
- Well, how are you?
- Hi, we're great. We're doing good.

458
00:46:43.332 --> 00:46:45.162
- How is she?
- She's here, hold on.

459
00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:48.061
Hey, Sister Abigail.
Do you wanna say hello?

460
00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:52.225
- Come on. Esther, just quickly say hi.
- I said, no.

461
00:46:55.872 --> 00:47:01.000
You know what, do you mind, darling,
can you get five apples for me?

462
00:47:01.642 --> 00:47:04.337
Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden.

463
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.909
It's all right.
I'm just calling to remind you...

464
00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:09.341
...that I'm gonna need her medical...

465
00:47:09.513 --> 00:47:12.207
...and dental charts
for my supervision report.

466
00:47:15.984 --> 00:47:17.917
She's not thrilled about the dentist.

467
00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:24.976
How is everyone doing?
Is she opening up to you?

468
00:47:25.154 --> 00:47:28.611
I guess you can say that. She dropped
the F-bomb on me a few weeks ago.

469
00:47:31.659 --> 00:47:33.352
I guess she's finally
coming out of her shell.

470
00:47:34.927 --> 00:47:36.587
Yeah.

471
00:47:36.761 --> 00:47:38.524
Any other glitches I should know of?

472
00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:40.219
We had a big one recently.

473
00:47:40.397 --> 00:47:42.421
It's a girl named Brenda at school.

474
00:47:44.766 --> 00:47:48.165
They were at the playground,
there was a slide, well, she fell off.

475
00:47:48.334 --> 00:47:51.598
Esther may have pushed her down.

476
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:54.363
I'm not getting the story straight,
but she got hurt.

477
00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:55.562
Is she all right?

478
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.934
Luckily. She broke her ankle
and had something like six stitches.

479
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.732
That doesn't sound too lucky.

480
00:48:00.908 --> 00:48:03.239
Well, she's lucky
she didn't break her neck.

481
00:48:32.926 --> 00:48:35.621
You told me you didn't
know how to play.

482
00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:38.388
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

483
00:48:38.563 --> 00:48:41.463
You offered to teach me
and I accepted.

484
00:48:41.665 --> 00:48:47.067
Okay. So then you were
just pretending this whole time?

485
00:48:47.235 --> 00:48:49.202
I thought you would
enjoy teaching me.

486
00:48:49.369 --> 00:48:53.269
It must be frustrating for someone
who loves music as much as you...

487
00:48:53.438 --> 00:48:57.270
...to have a son who isn't interested
and a daughter who can't even hear.

488
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.702
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:49:07.112 --> 00:49:09.739
I walk in on her playing Tchaikovsky
without a mistake.

490
00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:12.211
I mean, she's been lying to me
this whole time.

491
00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:15.248
She just wants to spend time
with you. It's hardly a lie.

492
00:49:15.418 --> 00:49:16.441
You wouldn't know.

493
00:49:16.617 --> 00:49:19.210
You wouldn't.
She's on her best behavior with you.

494
00:49:19.385 --> 00:49:22.444
She's completely different with me.

495
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:24.383
So, what are you saying?

496
00:49:24.555 --> 00:49:26.921
I don't know.
She threw a fit at school.

497
00:49:27.091 --> 00:49:28.886
She pushed Brenda at the playground.

498
00:49:29.058 --> 00:49:32.958
- Now you're saying that was her fault?
- I don't know. Honey, I don't know.

499
00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:35.424
I wasn't there.
You were watching them.

500
00:49:35.595 --> 00:49:39.154
Oh, come on. It was an accident.

501
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.559
Okay, let's not blame her
for anything, fine.

502
00:49:42.732 --> 00:49:44.392
I'll take her word for everything.

503
00:49:44.566 --> 00:49:47.659
Should I just believe what she said
about you and Joyce too?

504
00:49:47.835 --> 00:49:49.769
What did she say?

505
00:49:50.637 --> 00:49:54.503
- She says that you were hitting on her.
- What?

506
00:49:54.706 --> 00:49:58.300
Oh, come on. She must've
misunderstood. It was, like...

507
00:49:58.474 --> 00:49:59.805
Did she invite you over?

508
00:49:59.975 --> 00:50:03.136
She asked me
to help her move a chair.

509
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.335
- She did?
- Yeah. I blew her off.

510
00:50:07.512 --> 00:50:09.911
Oh, God.

511
00:50:10.081 --> 00:50:11.275
Why didn't you tell me?

512
00:50:11.449 --> 00:50:13.279
- l...
- We could've laughed about it.

513
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.246
- No, I knew how...
- You were hiding it.

514
00:50:15.417 --> 00:50:17.816
Honey, I knew how you'd react.

515
00:50:17.985 --> 00:50:20.179
Kate. Kate.

516
00:50:20.353 --> 00:50:23.185
You can't get jealous of every woman
that I talk to, right?

517
00:50:23.355 --> 00:50:25.685
- It's been like 10 years.
- What does that mean?

518
00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.016
You say that like it
actually means something.

519
00:50:28.224 --> 00:50:30.589
It's only been two years
since you told me.

520
00:50:30.759 --> 00:50:35.626
You know how sorry I am. I just feel
like I've earned a little trust here.

521
00:50:35.795 --> 00:50:39.490
- I gave you a second chance.
- That's not fair. That's not fair.

522
00:50:39.664 --> 00:50:42.860
Let me get this straight. We can talk
about my mistakes, not yours?

523
00:50:43.033 --> 00:50:46.524
I was sick! You were an asshole
who wanted to fuck somebody else!

524
00:50:46.736 --> 00:50:49.032
You put our child's life in danger.

525
00:50:49.236 --> 00:50:52.204
I could've walked away months ago.
Nobody would've blamed me.

526
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:56.829
Oh, that's sharp. That's sharp. Where
did you get that from, your mother?

527
00:51:10.548 --> 00:51:14.209
Danny. Turn that crap down, please,
I gotta work.

528
00:51:14.383 --> 00:51:15.440
- Fine.
- Thank you.

529
00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:22.015
I'll get it.

530
00:51:27.524 --> 00:51:31.050
- Hello, Esther.
- What are you doing here?

531
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.318
May I come in?

532
00:51:33.495 --> 00:51:36.860
I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.

533
00:51:37.029 --> 00:51:39.155
There could be something wrong
with Esther.

534
00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:40.525
What?

535
00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:43.791
What? You told us that you'd never
had any trouble with her.

536
00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:47.230
I didn't. But trouble does have a way
of finding her.

537
00:51:47.401 --> 00:51:48.459
What kind of trouble?

538
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.165
Two girls get into a fight, there she is.

539
00:51:52.338 --> 00:51:55.000
Someone gets caught stealing,
there she is again.

540
00:51:55.173 --> 00:51:57.367
- So? Does that mean...?
- Just let her finish.

541
00:51:57.541 --> 00:52:01.805
After you told me about the girl in
the playground, I called her old school.

542
00:52:01.977 --> 00:52:04.410
While she was there,
there was a boy...

543
00:52:04.578 --> 00:52:06.545
...who fell with scissors in his hand...

544
00:52:06.713 --> 00:52:09.340
...and accidentally stabbed himself
through the jaw.

545
00:52:09.514 --> 00:52:11.004
And Esther was there again.

546
00:52:11.182 --> 00:52:14.548
I don't understand.
He accidentally stabbed himself.

547
00:52:15.184 --> 00:52:18.152
But the most troubling thing
is the Sullivan house fire.

548
00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:21.343
I checked into it further. It was arson.

549
00:52:22.388 --> 00:52:24.753
They have never found the person
who did it.

550
00:52:24.923 --> 00:52:26.913
What are you suggesting here?

551
00:52:27.091 --> 00:52:29.422
That she had anything to do
with any of this?

552
00:52:29.592 --> 00:52:30.889
It's ridiculous.

553
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.049
That a child could commit such crimes...

554
00:52:33.227 --> 00:52:35.091
...it flies in the face
of everything I believe.

555
00:52:35.295 --> 00:52:36.728
Well, yeah.

556
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:46.234
There's a mean lady here.
She's come to take me away.

557
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:48.369
Will you help me?

558
00:52:48.537 --> 00:52:52.164
We've had some behavioral
problems, but...

559
00:52:52.338 --> 00:52:54.998
Yeah, nothing like that. I mean, right?

560
00:52:55.173 --> 00:52:57.868
- Yes, we have.
- Really, hon, think about it.

561
00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:01.737
I've tried to reach the Russian
orphanage where she was raised.

562
00:53:01.911 --> 00:53:04.504
I think we need to know
what we're dealing with.

563
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:07.168
Well, I'll tell you
what we're dealing with.

564
00:53:07.346 --> 00:53:09.404
- No, you know what?
- Stop it. Listen.

565
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:12.743
We're dealing with a 9-year-old girl
who's an orphan, okay?

566
00:53:12.917 --> 00:53:16.943
- We're taking her to Dr. Browning.
- We can take her to Dr. Browning.

567
00:54:14.352 --> 00:54:15.942
Do you want to play?

568
00:54:23.223 --> 00:54:25.885
I'll call you as soon as
I find anything else out.

569
00:54:26.057 --> 00:54:28.617
- Right. Take care.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

570
00:54:28.793 --> 00:54:30.453
Maybe later.

571
00:54:51.405 --> 00:54:52.428
It's going to be fine.

572
00:54:52.606 --> 00:54:55.938
We'll scare her so bad
she'll never come back here.

573
00:55:04.246 --> 00:55:05.270
Here she comes.

574
00:55:05.447 --> 00:55:07.471
Wave your arms and make her stop.

575
00:55:07.648 --> 00:55:08.875
Max, go.

576
00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:41.193
You all right? Max?

577
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.128
Max?

578
00:55:43.701 --> 00:55:44.759
You okay?

579
00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:00.199
Stop crying.

580
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:04.869
Grab a foot and help me
get her off the road.

581
00:56:05.047 --> 00:56:06.638
Now.

582
00:57:15.586 --> 00:57:18.985
Help me hide her.

583
00:57:57.276 --> 00:57:58.766
That doesn't matter.

584
00:57:58.978 --> 00:58:02.537
They'll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her.

585
00:58:02.713 --> 00:58:06.545
I had to kill her because she
was going to tell on me.

586
00:58:08.082 --> 00:58:13.041
You're not going to tell on me.
Are you?

587
00:58:22.423 --> 00:58:23.720
Don't worry.

588
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:26.051
You're my little sister.

589
00:58:26.226 --> 00:58:29.352
I won't let anything happen to you.

590
00:58:29.527 --> 00:58:31.016
I love you.

591
00:59:41.535 --> 00:59:43.764
Tell me what you saw.

592
00:59:43.936 --> 00:59:46.733
- What are you doing?
- What did you see?

593
00:59:46.904 --> 00:59:49.064
I saw you and Max in the tree house.

594
00:59:49.239 --> 00:59:50.637
What else?

595
00:59:50.806 --> 00:59:53.138
- What do you mean?
- What else did you see?

596
00:59:53.308 --> 00:59:54.968
I didn't see anything. I swear.

597
00:59:55.143 --> 00:59:57.076
- Did you tell anyone?
- No.

598
00:59:57.911 --> 00:59:59.240
I didn't tell anyone.

599
01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:02.071
Please...

600
01:00:02.246 --> 01:00:06.306
If I find out that you're lying,
I'll cut your hairless little prick off...

601
01:00:06.482 --> 01:00:09.279
...before you even figure out
what it's for.

602
01:00:10.317 --> 01:00:13.251
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

603
01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.281
You pissed yourself.

604
01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:32.495
It was nice talking to you, Alice.
I hope we can be friends.

605
01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.686
I'd like that.

606
01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.464
- We'll be right out, honey.
- You can come on in.

607
01:00:46.103 --> 01:00:49.128
My initial instinct is that...

608
01:00:49.305 --> 01:00:53.104
...there's not a deeply-rooted problem
in Esther's past.

609
01:00:53.808 --> 01:00:57.833
- So there's nothing wrong with her?
- No.

610
01:01:01.012 --> 01:01:03.878
It's not all good news.
I think what needs to be examined...

611
01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:07.605
...is Esther's relationship
with those around her.

612
01:01:10.603 --> 01:01:12.298
Specifically with you, Kate.

613
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:16.269
It seems she feels there's been some
real tension between the two of you.

614
01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.601
- Okay.
- She's doing her best to please you...

615
01:01:19.774 --> 01:01:22.207
...but you're blocking her attempts
to bond.

616
01:01:23.711 --> 01:01:28.009
That's not true. That's not true at all.
I've done everything.

617
01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.874
- Right?
- Just let her finish.

618
01:01:31.047 --> 01:01:33.947
Something's happening
to cause Esther to feel this way.

619
01:01:34.116 --> 01:01:38.484
Perhaps it's your guilt about drinking
or what happened to Max.

620
01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:41.348
Maybe some of your feelings
of inadequacy as a mother...

621
01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:44.851
...are manifesting themselves
in your relationship with Esther.

622
01:01:45.022 --> 01:01:47.183
I don't feel inadequate.

623
01:01:50.525 --> 01:01:52.220
What did she tell you?

624
01:01:52.427 --> 01:01:55.519
She didn't see. She doesn't know.

625
01:01:56.729 --> 01:01:58.787
She's so stupid.

626
01:01:58.963 --> 01:02:02.625
Esther's a very shy, reserved...

627
01:02:02.799 --> 01:02:06.426
...sensitive little girl going through
an extremely difficult time.

628
01:02:13.138 --> 01:02:16.628
She's exceptionally bright
and highly articulate.

629
01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:23.074
She just needs a little patience
and understanding.

630
01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:43.179
Thanks for your support back there.

631
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:46.318
That was your idea.

632
01:02:49.693 --> 01:02:51.659
Kate, wait, wait, wait.

633
01:02:51.826 --> 01:02:55.158
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but a lot of what she said made sense.

634
01:02:55.329 --> 01:02:57.228
Do you wanna get that?

635
01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:03.559
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Mrs. Coleman?

636
01:03:03.733 --> 01:03:04.824
Yes. Who's this?

637
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.933
This is Sister Judith
from St. Mariana's.

638
01:03:07.101 --> 01:03:09.262
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to know...

639
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.336
...if Sister Abigail
made it to her appointment with you.

640
01:03:12.506 --> 01:03:14.665
Yes. Why?

641
01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:16.703
She hasn't returned since yesterday...

642
01:03:16.874 --> 01:03:19.967
... and I'm just starting
to get really worried.

643
01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:32.914
Charlie 24, you wanna hold them there?

644
01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:39.710
Hey.

645
01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:47.723
Okay, I think we're done.

646
01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.715
Detective, do you have any leads
or suspects?

647
01:03:52.894 --> 01:03:56.727
- No, not yet.
- I just don't understand...

648
01:03:56.897 --> 01:03:59.420
...this kind of thing.
Who would do this? It's...

649
01:03:59.597 --> 01:04:00.621
Awful.

650
01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:03.096
You think of anything else,
you give us a call.

651
01:04:03.267 --> 01:04:04.756
Yes. Absolutely.

652
01:04:05.635 --> 01:04:07.226
Let's go.

653
01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:06.929
This is what Sister Abigail
was talking about. Look.

654
01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:10.798
"Character-disturbed children."
Look at the symptoms.

655
01:05:10.971 --> 01:05:16.066
"Superficially charming. Difficulty
at making and keeping friends."

656
01:05:16.808 --> 01:05:18.570
I'm not sure this is what she meant.

657
01:05:18.743 --> 01:05:22.677
She could've told Dr. Browning
whatever she wanted to hear. Look.

658
01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:27.337
They "are adroit manipulators...

659
01:05:27.547 --> 01:05:31.345
...oftentimes playing people off
one another to get what they want."

660
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:33.778
Well, you gonna show this
to Dr. Browning?

661
01:05:33.951 --> 01:05:36.282
I'm not showing her anything.

662
01:05:36.819 --> 01:05:38.479
I'm not seeing her anymore.

663
01:05:38.653 --> 01:05:41.621
- When did you decide that?
- When do you think?

664
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:43.652
You're gonna discount Dr. Browning?

665
01:05:43.822 --> 01:05:47.621
Why does everyone get the benefit
of the doubt from you except for me?

666
01:05:57.564 --> 01:06:00.622
If you need help with the kids,
we can arrange that.

667
01:06:00.799 --> 01:06:03.063
I don't need help.

668
01:06:12.072 --> 01:06:13.869
I just wanna know more about her.

669
01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:18.007
I wanna know where she came from,
and I wanna know who she is.

670
01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:20.370
What if Sister Abigail was right?

671
01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:23.339
I mean, if someone was in danger,
our own children...

672
01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:26.207
...wouldn't you wanna know?
- Of course I would.

673
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.144
I'll contact the orphanage she came from
in Russia. All right?

674
01:06:30.315 --> 01:06:31.839
I mean, it's a start.

675
01:06:42.222 --> 01:06:44.849
- What?
- Hey.

676
01:06:51.294 --> 01:06:52.783
Fine.

677
01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:56.293
I was wondering if you'd heard from
anyone at the Sludyanka Shelter.

678
01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:59.159
Sister Abigail had mentioned
that she would...

679
01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:00.892
Oh, you did.

680
01:07:04.034 --> 01:07:07.230
I don't understand. How can they have
no record of her being there?

681
01:07:09.004 --> 01:07:10.301
Yes, please.

682
01:07:10.472 --> 01:07:14.599
Could you just call me as soon as
you know anything, please? Thank you.

683
01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:48.151
Esther, we gotta go.

684
01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:56.525
Esther?

685
01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:02.261
Esther?

686
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:05.032
You got me.

687
01:08:07.938 --> 01:08:10.735
- What?
- I don't want to go to the dentist.

688
01:08:10.906 --> 01:08:13.532
- Why not?
- I just don't want to go.

689
01:08:13.707 --> 01:08:15.936
- What, are you scared?
- No.

690
01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:19.708
We're gonna reschedule, though.

691
01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:24.107
Tell you what, I'll let you play hooky
if you want to come and draw with me.

692
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:26.212
All right.

693
01:08:29.883 --> 01:08:31.577
Wait, Daniel.

694
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:35.206
How are you two getting along
with Esther?

695
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.880
Fine, I guess.

696
01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:40.385
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Mom.

697
01:08:42.691 --> 01:08:46.715
But has she ever made you feel,
I don't know, uncomfortable...

698
01:08:46.892 --> 01:08:49.883
...or has she done anything
that she's not supposed to do?

699
01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:55.023
- No.
- Like, has she ever hurt any of you?

700
01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:57.755
No.

701
01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.699
You sure?

702
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:09.262
Okay. All right.

703
01:09:10.873 --> 01:09:13.466
I like it when it's just the two of us.

704
01:09:13.674 --> 01:09:17.733
You don't know how long I've waited
for a daddy just like you.

705
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:19.377
Mommy too, right?

706
01:09:21.378 --> 01:09:23.242
I don't think
Mommy likes me very much.

707
01:09:23.412 --> 01:09:24.811
Hey.

708
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.540
- That is not true. Mommy loves you.
- It's all right.

709
01:09:27.716 --> 01:09:30.809
It must be hard to love an adopted child
as much as your own.

710
01:09:30.985 --> 01:09:35.442
Sweetheart, you're just as much a part
of this family as Danny and Max. Okay?

711
01:09:36.554 --> 01:09:39.783
Do something nice for Mommy.
Show her how much you love her.

712
01:09:39.955 --> 01:09:42.480
That's a wonderful idea.

713
01:10:02.102 --> 01:10:04.262
I have a special surprise
for you, Mommy.

714
01:10:05.237 --> 01:10:06.634
You do?

715
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.001
I picked these flowers just for you.

716
01:10:13.974 --> 01:10:19.932
- Esther, what did you do? God.
- My arm!

717
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:21.476
- Why did you do this?
- Daddy, my arm!

718
01:10:23.213 --> 01:10:24.339
- John!
- Hey.

719
01:10:24.514 --> 01:10:27.505
- What did you do?
- Hey. Stop, stop.

720
01:10:27.716 --> 01:10:28.772
Why did you do this?

721
01:10:28.949 --> 01:10:32.008
- Oh, God. God, she did this on purpose.
- No, no, no.

722
01:10:32.218 --> 01:10:33.651
- Yes, she did.
- Hey. Honey, no.

723
01:10:33.818 --> 01:10:36.252
She knew what these roses meant to me.

724
01:10:36.421 --> 01:10:39.752
It's my fault, hon. I told her
to do something nice for you.

725
01:10:39.923 --> 01:10:41.617
I can't believe this.

726
01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.043
Daddy!

727
01:12:26.782 --> 01:12:29.045
Daddy!

728
01:12:30.185 --> 01:12:32.675
Daddy, Daddy!

729
01:12:32.853 --> 01:12:33.910
What is it, honey?

730
01:12:34.554 --> 01:12:36.713
My arm still hurts.

731
01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:45.092
Can I have a look at it?
You're okay.

732
01:12:45.293 --> 01:12:47.725
I'll be gentle. It's all right, honey.

733
01:12:47.893 --> 01:12:49.656
Oh, my God.

734
01:12:51.529 --> 01:12:54.019
We need to take you to the hospital.

735
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.033
You're a brave little girl,
you know that?

736
01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:03.999
Doctor said you're gonna heal
real fast, okay?

737
01:13:20.513 --> 01:13:21.706
You broke her arm.

738
01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:27.941
It's impossible.
I didn't grab her that hard.

739
01:13:28.117 --> 01:13:33.211
She wants to sleep in here tonight.
Maybe you should sleep downstairs.

740
01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:55.564
I'm having guests for dinner.

741
01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:02.396
You know, you can have it. Thanks.

742
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:08.000
Have a good day.

743
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:17.502
Daniel.

744
01:15:17.678 --> 01:15:19.406
Your books.

745
01:15:22.915 --> 01:15:26.179
- What happened? Let me see your bag.
- I don't know.

746
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:31.942
We just bought this.
Pick it up, it's gonna get wet.

747
01:15:38.522 --> 01:15:40.183
Mom!

748
01:15:42.392 --> 01:15:45.622
Max! No! Help!

749
01:15:47.128 --> 01:15:48.925
Max!

750
01:15:50.696 --> 01:15:52.254
Max!

751
01:16:04.604 --> 01:16:06.162
Max!

752
01:16:13.676 --> 01:16:15.540
Max!

753
01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:17.473
Are you okay?

754
01:16:17.645 --> 01:16:21.011
I'm here. Mommy's here.
You're okay, honey. Come on.

755
01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:26.138
I got you. Yeah. Oh, baby, it's okay.
I'm so sorry.

756
01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.674
I remember I put it in park
and I set the brake.

757
01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.548
Max didn't indicate
that Esther did anything.

758
01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:38.815
Well, Max is covering for her.
And I don't think it's the first time.

759
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.516
It also wouldn't be the first time
you blamed Esther for your own mistake.

760
01:16:46.062 --> 01:16:48.528
You know what?
I want her out of this house.

761
01:16:48.696 --> 01:16:50.959
You're ready for somebody
to come and take her?

762
01:16:51.131 --> 01:16:53.564
I am. I don't care.

763
01:16:53.732 --> 01:16:57.565
I will do whatever it takes
to protect my children.

764
01:16:57.735 --> 01:16:59.428
The girls found this this morning.

765
01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:03.064
The girls found it.
You mean Esther found it.

766
01:17:03.238 --> 01:17:05.865
Yes, Esther. Does it make
any difference? Is she lying?

767
01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:07.164
You need help.

768
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.364
We've reserved a place for you
in a rehabilitation facility...

769
01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:12.872
...about 45 minutes from here.

770
01:17:13.042 --> 01:17:14.407
I didn't drink it.

771
01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:18.011
I bought two bottles.
I poured one of them down the sink.

772
01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:19.908
- But not this one?
- No.

773
01:17:20.081 --> 01:17:23.878
John, I haven't had a drink
in almost a year.

774
01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:26.516
We wanna help you,
but there's nothing we can do...

775
01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:30.743
...until you stop lying to yourself.
- I'm not lying. I wanted to drink it.

776
01:17:30.953 --> 01:17:34.512
You have no fucking idea how badly
I wanted to drink it, but I didn't.

777
01:17:34.688 --> 01:17:37.053
- I didn't drink it.
- lf Max had gotten hurt...

778
01:17:37.223 --> 01:17:40.816
What happened this morning
has nothing to do with this.

779
01:17:40.992 --> 01:17:42.584
I find that hard to believe.

780
01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:47.522
The only reason that I'm sober
is because of Max and Daniel.

781
01:17:48.596 --> 01:17:52.155
I think about what would have happened
had you not been there...

782
01:17:52.331 --> 01:17:54.356
...and it makes me wanna kill myself.

783
01:17:54.534 --> 01:17:56.261
I would never do anything...

784
01:17:56.467 --> 01:17:59.526
...to let something like that
ever happen again. I wouldn't.

785
01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:01.999
That is so manipulative.

786
01:18:02.171 --> 01:18:05.537
I know I haven't given you reason
to believe me, I know I haven't.

787
01:18:05.706 --> 01:18:08.036
I lied to you.
I should have told you about this.

788
01:18:08.207 --> 01:18:11.539
I'll go to therapy, I'll go to fucking A.A.
if that's what you want...

789
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:14.074
...but you have to believe me.
- I don't.

790
01:18:14.244 --> 01:18:17.076
You have to believe me.
John, you have to trust me on this.

791
01:18:17.246 --> 01:18:19.678
I'll give you a week to go to rehab...

792
01:18:19.847 --> 01:18:22.371
...or I'm leaving
and I'm taking the kids with me.

793
01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:24.743
I think that's fair, okay?

794
01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:27.441
I'll help you as much as I can,
make it really easy.

795
01:18:27.618 --> 01:18:29.414
Mom's gonna come in the afternoon.

796
01:18:29.586 --> 01:18:34.544
All right? I'm willing to do this.
I'm willing to try and figure this out.

797
01:18:34.722 --> 01:18:38.520
- But it's up to you.
- I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.

798
01:18:59.436 --> 01:19:02.131
Max. Max, are you okay?

799
01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:06.795
What did she do? Did she do something
to make the car crash?

800
01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:12.909
If you saw her, you have to help me,
so Mom and Dad can protect us.

801
01:19:15.912 --> 01:19:17.105
Why not?

802
01:19:26.284 --> 01:19:28.376
Is that Sister Abigail?

803
01:19:35.523 --> 01:19:38.423
Max. What did she do
in my tree house?

804
01:19:41.259 --> 01:19:42.954
Are the bad things still there?

805
01:19:46.295 --> 01:19:48.263
Everything's gonna be okay.

806
01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:53.161
I'll get the stuff from the tree house.
Then they'll have to believe us.

807
01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:43.522
- Going somewhere, Kate?
- What are you doing here?

808
01:20:43.694 --> 01:20:46.184
She's fine. Let's not wake her.

809
01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:47.523
Go to your room.

810
01:20:47.696 --> 01:20:51.256
Honestly, we're past that now.
Aren't we?

811
01:20:51.432 --> 01:20:53.490
I know what you're doing.

812
01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:56.532
I will not let you hurt my children.

813
01:20:56.702 --> 01:20:57.929
Me?

814
01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:01.696
I'm not the one who passed out drunk
and let Max almost drown in the pond.

815
01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:03.303
If it wasn't for John...

816
01:21:03.472 --> 01:21:07.271
...she'd be dead,
and you'd probably still be in jail.

817
01:21:09.209 --> 01:21:10.301
Who told you that?

818
01:21:13.011 --> 01:21:14.205
It's very intimate.

819
01:21:15.145 --> 01:21:16.806
- I learned so much.
- Give it to me.

820
01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.505
- Jessica. Your cheating husband.
- Esther, give it to me.

821
01:21:20.682 --> 01:21:22.478
Where you hide your wine bottles.

822
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.981
I'm... I'm warning you right now.

823
01:21:25.151 --> 01:21:27.482
"She was still kicking
when the doctor told me...

824
01:21:27.653 --> 01:21:30.348
...it was something called phantom...

825
01:21:30.521 --> 01:21:31.987
...fetal movement.

826
01:21:32.155 --> 01:21:35.816
- For 16 days, I carried my dead baby."
- Stop it. Esther.

827
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:39.220
"It was the cruelest torture
I could imagine."

828
01:21:39.393 --> 01:21:41.826
Stop it. You stop it.

829
01:21:41.994 --> 01:21:44.120
What's wrong with you?

830
01:21:44.296 --> 01:21:47.058
Kate, it's too late. It's your own fault.

831
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.890
You took your family for granted.

832
01:21:49.498 --> 01:21:52.625
- What do you mean?
- What are you going to do?

833
01:21:54.301 --> 01:21:55.996
Hit me?

834
01:22:01.738 --> 01:22:04.797
We adopted her from you.
How could you not know anything?

835
01:22:04.974 --> 01:22:07.237
The Sullivans could have
adopted her illegally.

836
01:22:07.409 --> 01:22:10.376
She doesn't remember anything
that could help us?

837
01:22:12.244 --> 01:22:13.734
I'm gonna call you back.

838
01:23:31.154 --> 01:23:34.020
"Saarne Institute."

839
01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:56.899
Hello. Do you speak English?

840
01:23:58.771 --> 01:24:00.431
Do you speak English?

841
01:24:00.605 --> 01:24:02.594
Is there anyone
who speaks English there?

842
01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:04.740
This is very important.

843
01:24:08.809 --> 01:24:10.174
I don't know what you're saying.

844
01:24:23.484 --> 01:24:25.814
- Hello?
- Is this the Saarne Institute?

845
01:24:25.984 --> 01:24:27.542
Yes.

846
01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:31.153
Yes. I need to talk to somebody
about one of your children.

847
01:24:31.321 --> 01:24:33.948
She was adopted by an American family.
It's a girl.

848
01:24:34.123 --> 01:24:37.249
She is not come from here.

849
01:24:37.424 --> 01:24:39.550
Well, I haven't even
told you her name yet.

850
01:24:39.725 --> 01:24:42.591
You do not understand.
Saarne Institute is not an orphanage.

851
01:24:42.761 --> 01:24:44.126
It is a mental hospital.

852
01:25:12.144 --> 01:25:14.111
Are you looking for this?

853
01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:17.711
Poor Sister Abigail.

854
01:25:18.915 --> 01:25:23.679
I couldn't have done it myself,
you know. Max is just as guilty as I am.

855
01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:27.512
- Whatever Max did, you made her do it.
- Think about it.

856
01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:30.210
How did she even know
what was up here?

857
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.983
It's always better
to burn the evidence.

858
01:25:34.157 --> 01:25:39.023
If they find these things,
they won't just be coming for me.

859
01:25:39.225 --> 01:25:40.954
They'll be coming for Max too.

860
01:25:42.428 --> 01:25:44.328
- Is that really what you want?
- Wait.

861
01:25:46.129 --> 01:25:47.460
What are you doing?

862
01:25:48.664 --> 01:25:50.256
Are you crazy?

863
01:25:56.936 --> 01:25:58.266
Let me out!

864
01:25:58.437 --> 01:26:00.267
Let me out of here!

865
01:26:10.609 --> 01:26:13.600
Mom!

866
01:26:14.112 --> 01:26:19.138
It's called the Saarne Institute.
S-A-A-R-N-E, Saarne.

867
01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:20.542
It's in Estonia.

868
01:26:20.749 --> 01:26:25.309
Estonia? No, this can't be right.
All of her paperwork is from Russia.

869
01:26:25.485 --> 01:26:27.884
I'm sending them a picture
of her right now.

870
01:26:28.053 --> 01:26:30.816
Maybe her birth mother
was a patient there.

871
01:26:30.988 --> 01:26:33.546
I don't know.
Maybe she was even born there.

872
01:26:38.892 --> 01:26:40.951
Mom!

873
01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:44.626
Help!

874
01:27:00.772 --> 01:27:03.001
Mom! Dad!

875
01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:11.866
Oh, God!

876
01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:23.310
Oh, God. Call 911!

877
01:27:35.191 --> 01:27:37.715
Don't worry. You're going to heaven.

878
01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:42.189
Oh, God!

879
01:27:44.529 --> 01:27:48.988
Oh, my God! Daniel!

880
01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.032
Move away! Move away from the fire!

881
01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.257
Daniel?

882
01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:57.733
Oh, God, no. Daniel?
Mommy's right here. Can you hear me?

883
01:27:57.904 --> 01:28:00.895
Please wake up.
Honey, Mommy's right here, okay?

884
01:28:01.073 --> 01:28:03.301
You're gonna be all right.

885
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:17.943
We stopped the abdominal bleeding,
but he has a very serious neck injury.

886
01:28:18.115 --> 01:28:22.174
He's stabilized for now. You should
consider yourselves very lucky.

887
01:28:22.351 --> 01:28:24.716
- Can we see him?
- In a little while.

888
01:28:24.886 --> 01:28:26.853
He's resting in the ICU.

889
01:28:27.019 --> 01:28:30.454
Okay. And will he be able to tell us
what happened?

890
01:28:30.622 --> 01:28:32.180
It's possible.

891
01:28:32.357 --> 01:28:35.449
No way of knowing for sure
what he'll remember until he wakes up.

892
01:28:36.225 --> 01:28:37.816
Excuse me.

893
01:28:40.594 --> 01:28:42.424
It's gonna be okay.

894
01:28:46.198 --> 01:28:50.291
I know you're exhausted
and upset, and so am I.

895
01:28:50.466 --> 01:28:54.265
There has to be some other explanation.
She didn't come from an insane asylum.

896
01:28:54.435 --> 01:28:58.767
The orphanage you thought
she came from has never heard of her.

897
01:28:58.938 --> 01:29:00.700
Everything about her could be a lie.

898
01:29:00.872 --> 01:29:03.863
We have her passport. We have
school records, medical records.

899
01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.133
These are papers
from around the world.

900
01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:08.366
What is this? It's a piece of paper.

901
01:29:08.544 --> 01:29:12.773
Your own mother was there this time. It
wasn't just me. Your mother was there.

902
01:29:13.412 --> 01:29:16.312
It's either Esther
or Daniel who started the fire.

903
01:29:16.481 --> 01:29:19.244
- Who do you think it was?
- I don't know.

904
01:29:19.416 --> 01:29:22.077
I'm so done.
I'm done connecting these dots for you.

905
01:29:22.251 --> 01:29:24.717
You know, you can think
whatever you want about me.

906
01:29:24.885 --> 01:29:28.217
I will leave tonight. If that's
what you want, I will leave tonight.

907
01:29:28.388 --> 01:29:30.617
On one condition. Esther goes too.

908
01:29:34.592 --> 01:29:36.785
Can I have a dollar
for the soda machine?

909
01:29:37.293 --> 01:29:40.159
Your mother wants you
to stay right there.

910
01:29:46.565 --> 01:29:49.930
There you go. Don't be too long.

911
01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:24.874
Okay.

912
01:31:15.147 --> 01:31:16.614
What? What is it, sweetie?

913
01:31:26.621 --> 01:31:28.782
Code 99, ICU.

914
01:31:28.956 --> 01:31:31.354
Code 99, ICU.

915
01:31:31.857 --> 01:31:34.154
- Coming through, coming through.
- Mom, take Max.

916
01:31:34.325 --> 01:31:37.656
Let's go, Room 304! Crash
cart coming through! Move, people!

917
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.185
- Daniel?
- Clear the hall! Clear the hall!

918
01:31:40.363 --> 01:31:43.557
You have to stay out here.
He's in cardiac arrest. Stay out here.

919
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:44.788
Daniel!

920
01:31:47.065 --> 01:31:48.293
- Here we go.
- Start a drip.

921
01:31:48.467 --> 01:31:50.400
- Check BP, please.
- Check ventilation.

922
01:31:50.568 --> 01:31:52.000
Oh, God.

923
01:31:52.168 --> 01:31:54.794
We got a pulse. We got a pulse.

924
01:31:57.671 --> 01:31:58.695
Kate.

925
01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.366
Kate.

926
01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:06.172
What did you do?
What did you do to him, you bitch?

927
01:32:06.342 --> 01:32:07.400
Stop, stop!

928
01:32:07.577 --> 01:32:10.477
- Orderlies!
- She's trying to kill my baby!

929
01:32:10.646 --> 01:32:12.078
- Daddy!
- Hold her!

930
01:32:12.246 --> 01:32:14.339
She's trying to kill my baby!

931
01:32:15.547 --> 01:32:16.844
Hold her still.

932
01:32:17.515 --> 01:32:19.176
Get off me.

933
01:32:20.484 --> 01:32:22.577
Hold her still. Hold her still.

934
01:32:23.185 --> 01:32:25.676
Okay. Easy, easy.

935
01:32:25.855 --> 01:32:28.083
- You okay?
- There you go.

936
01:32:48.067 --> 01:32:51.159
- Kate.
- Daniel.

937
01:32:51.335 --> 01:32:53.825
They're running tests.
We should know more tomorrow.

938
01:32:54.003 --> 01:32:56.197
Don't worry about Daniel.
He'll be okay.

939
01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.029
He'll be home in a few days.

940
01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:01.070
You need to stay here, get some rest.

941
01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.230
I'm gonna take Max and Esther home.

942
01:33:03.408 --> 01:33:05.342
Johnny.

943
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:09.537
Please don't let her near Max.

944
01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.069
I love you.

945
01:35:46.933 --> 01:35:48.866
Hello, Daddy.

946
01:35:50.969 --> 01:35:53.493
- What are you wearing?
- Do you like it?

947
01:35:55.471 --> 01:35:58.132
Oh, Jesus.

948
01:36:03.777 --> 01:36:07.768
Look at you. What have you done
to your face? What is this?

949
01:36:10.614 --> 01:36:13.377
I don't want to be alone. I'm scared.

950
01:36:20.652 --> 01:36:23.051
I love you, Daddy.

951
01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.278
You too, hon.

952
01:36:25.455 --> 01:36:26.888
I really love you.

953
01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:31.184
I know.

954
01:36:31.725 --> 01:36:32.783
I know.

955
01:36:35.895 --> 01:36:38.362
John, let me take care of you.

956
01:36:38.863 --> 01:36:40.954
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

957
01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:48.097
What's gotten into you, huh?
What's going on?

958
01:36:52.503 --> 01:36:55.096
You said you loved me.

959
01:37:00.742 --> 01:37:03.971
You are so confused.

960
01:37:04.844 --> 01:37:07.744
You know what?
I don't love you like that.

961
01:37:07.912 --> 01:37:11.210
That's the way Kate and I
love each other.

962
01:37:13.815 --> 01:37:15.373
You understand?

963
01:37:16.416 --> 01:37:18.179
I don't see that.

964
01:37:19.718 --> 01:37:22.208
- You have to respect your mother.
- I do.

965
01:37:22.387 --> 01:37:25.877
I just feel like I'm alone sometimes
in respecting you.

966
01:37:26.055 --> 01:37:30.252
I don't think anyone ever thinks
about what you might be feeling.

967
01:37:30.425 --> 01:37:33.222
I really care about you, John.

968
01:37:33.394 --> 01:37:36.021
Yeah, I know, Esther.

969
01:37:39.063 --> 01:37:41.690
I'm just... I'm tired.

970
01:37:42.765 --> 01:37:45.528
I'm very tired.

971
01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:47.757
And I don't know what to do.
It's difficult.

972
01:37:47.934 --> 01:37:50.561
I mean,
everything is just falling apart...

973
01:37:50.735 --> 01:37:55.398
...and, oh, my God,
I'm so worried for Daniel.

974
01:37:58.875 --> 01:38:00.898
Oh, God.

975
01:38:01.409 --> 01:38:03.899
You're a good person, John.

976
01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:06.374
You're a great father.

977
01:38:07.846 --> 01:38:09.905
And a handsome man.

978
01:38:13.281 --> 01:38:15.181
Jesus Christ!

979
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:17.078
My God, stop, stop, stop!

980
01:38:17.251 --> 01:38:19.912
Just stop talking and go upstairs!
Go to your room!

981
01:38:20.086 --> 01:38:23.679
- Stop talking to me like I'm a child.
- I'm calling Sister Judith tomorrow.

982
01:38:23.855 --> 01:38:26.755
We're gonna have a conversation
about your future in this house.

983
01:38:26.923 --> 01:38:28.685
I just... I can't do it anymore.

984
01:38:30.592 --> 01:38:31.854
Fine.

985
01:38:35.261 --> 01:38:36.249
Esther.

986
01:38:35.261 --> 01:38:36.249
Esther.

987
01:38:58.241 --> 01:39:00.299
- Hello?
- Yeah. This is she.

988
01:39:00.475 --> 01:39:03.932
My name is Dr. Värava.
I'm calling from the Saarne Institute.

989
01:39:05.912 --> 01:39:09.277
- I've just seen the picture you e-mailed.
- And do you recognize her?

990
01:39:09.447 --> 01:39:13.142
Where is she right now? Is she
someplace where she can hear you?

991
01:39:13.315 --> 01:39:16.078
No, she's not with me.
She's with my husband at home.

992
01:39:16.251 --> 01:39:20.982
Call your husband right now, and tell him
to get your family out of the house.

993
01:39:21.187 --> 01:39:25.246
- And then call the police.
- He won't listen to me. But why?

994
01:39:25.422 --> 01:39:29.221
Then tell him the little girl in the picture
is not really a little girl.

995
01:39:29.392 --> 01:39:32.291
- She's a grown woman.
- What?

996
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.950
What are you talking about?
The picture I sent you...

997
01:39:35.128 --> 01:39:38.926
... is of our adopted daughter,
and she's 9 years old.

998
01:39:39.097 --> 01:39:41.065
No, she's not.

999
01:39:41.498 --> 01:39:46.160
She has a rare hormone disorder.
It's called hypopituitarism.

1000
01:39:46.334 --> 01:39:49.302
It causes proportional dwarfism.
She only looks like a child.

1001
01:39:49.837 --> 01:39:55.101
According to our records,
Leena Klammer was born in 1976.

1002
01:39:55.273 --> 01:39:57.240
She's 33 years old.

1003
01:39:57.407 --> 01:39:59.806
This can't be. This is a mistake.

1004
01:39:59.975 --> 01:40:03.171
I hope so, for your sake.
Does she have the scars?

1005
01:40:03.344 --> 01:40:06.004
What? I don't know. What scars?

1006
01:40:06.212 --> 01:40:08.611
Leena was one
of our most violent patients.

1007
01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:11.270
When she was here,
she was kept in a straitjacket...

1008
01:40:11.448 --> 01:40:13.278
... to stop her from hurting our staff.

1009
01:40:13.449 --> 01:40:15.440
She was constantly fighting
to get out.

1010
01:40:15.618 --> 01:40:20.643
It cut into her skin and left her
with scars around her wrists and neck.

1011
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.117
There is no way
you could not have seen them.

1012
01:40:23.289 --> 01:40:24.755
Why was she at your hospital?

1013
01:40:24.923 --> 01:40:29.358
She's dangerously ill, violent.
She killed seven people that we know of.

1014
01:40:29.525 --> 01:40:32.322
Oh, my God. How could she fool us?

1015
01:40:32.494 --> 01:40:36.155
She has been passing herself off
as a little girl for most of her life.

1016
01:40:36.829 --> 01:40:39.853
She tricked a family here in Estonia
into adopting her.

1017
01:40:40.031 --> 01:40:45.023
When she couldn't seduce the father,
she killed him and his whole family.

1018
01:40:45.234 --> 01:40:48.760
- Then she burned the house down.
- Yes. How did you know?

1019
01:40:48.937 --> 01:40:51.995
She disappeared a year ago
and we lost track of her.

1020
01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:55.230
If it's really Leena,
you don't have much time.

1021
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:38.058
Esther?

1022
01:42:51.872 --> 01:42:54.931
Come on, Johnny. Come on.
Pick up the fucking phone.

1023
01:43:05.446 --> 01:43:07.242
Shit.

1024
01:43:29.127 --> 01:43:30.855
Come on.

1025
01:43:32.327 --> 01:43:33.521
Oh, God!

1026
01:44:05.947 --> 01:44:07.378
Come on.

1027
01:44:10.916 --> 01:44:11.939
Come on.

1028
01:44:12.116 --> 01:44:13.811
911. What is your emergency?

1029
01:44:13.985 --> 01:44:16.953
I need the police.
We have an intruder in our home.

1030
01:44:50.405 --> 01:44:51.463
Come on.

1031
01:44:55.941 --> 01:44:57.306
- This is John.
- John?

1032
01:44:57.475 --> 01:44:59.340
You've reached my cell,
but I can't pick up.

1033
01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:00.874
Oh, fuck it.

1034
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.115
John?

1035
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:27.349
John? John?

1036
01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:32.053
No, God!

1037
01:46:44.202 --> 01:46:46.032
No, God!

1038
01:46:49.071 --> 01:46:50.436
Max.

1039
01:48:30.295 --> 01:48:32.125
What the fuck?

1040
01:51:02.947 --> 01:51:05.676
Esther! Don't you hurt her!

1041
01:51:11.285 --> 01:51:14.219
Leave her alone! I'm here!

1042
01:51:15.221 --> 01:51:16.812
Esther!

1043
01:52:47.339 --> 01:52:48.636
I know.

1044
01:54:44.004 --> 01:54:46.995
Go back. It's too dangerous. Go back.

1045
01:55:00.647 --> 01:55:02.580
Please.

1046
01:55:02.748 --> 01:55:04.840
Don't let me die, Mommy.

1047
01:55:08.352 --> 01:55:11.911
I'm not your fucking Mommy!

1048
01:55:27.929 --> 01:55:30.158
Baby, it's okay.
