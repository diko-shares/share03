1
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.216
Will!

2
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.761
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:32.264
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.061
I think It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:40.398
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:43.984
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.364
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:51.951
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.958
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.919
In fact, I do. Mr Mercer?

11
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.925
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:17.560
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:20.062
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:23.858
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:28.028
And I have another one
for a Mr James Norrington.

16
00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:30.281
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:34.201
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:36.579
I didn't believe that wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.374
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:43.836
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.756
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:50.092
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.846
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:53.888 --> 00:03:57.767
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:57.808 --> 00:04:01.604
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:07.109
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.236
Captain.

28
00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.074
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:16.035
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:18.287
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:25.336
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

32
00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:30.299
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:35.763
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:40.434
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:05:03.082 --> 00:05:05.209
Prisoners, come on!

36
00:06:43.265 --> 00:06:45.434
Sorry, mate.

37
00:06:47.436 --> 00:06:50.731
Mind if we make a little side trip?

38
00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:53.859
I didn't think so.

39
00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:03.869
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

40
00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:06.122
were overcome.

41
00:07:07.415 --> 00:07:10.918
You got what you went in for, then?

42
00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:16.465
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

43
00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:19.885
were expecting something
a bit more shiny,

44
00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:24.140
with the Isla de Muerta going old pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea and the treasure with it.

45
00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:26.725
And the Royal Navy chasing us
all around the Atlantic.

46
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.645
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

47
00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:35.443
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

48
00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:39.697
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

49
00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:42.700
Is that how you're all feeling then?

50
00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:48.080
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

51
00:07:48.664 --> 00:07:50.583
Walk the plank.

52
00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:53.669
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

53
00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.089
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

54
00:08:05.222 --> 00:08:08.768
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

55
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.065
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

56
00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:18.194
It is a drawing of a key.

57
00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:26.452
Gentlemen,

58
00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:28.412
what do keys do?

59
00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:31.290
Keys

60
00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:33.834
unlock things?

61
00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:37.671
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

62
00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:41.050
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

63
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.718
No.

64
00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:47.181
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

65
00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:51.185
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

66
00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:55.731
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

67
00:08:55.731 --> 00:08:58.109
So we're going after this key.

68
00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:01.487
You're not making any sense at all.

69
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.031
Any more questions?

70
00:09:04.073 --> 00:09:06.617
So do we have a heading?

71
00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:09.787
A heading.

72
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.332
Set sail in a

73
00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:16.210
general

74
00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:22.883
that-way direction.

75
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.135
Captain?

76
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.056
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

77
00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:34.854
Have you noticed lately

78
00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:39.567
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

79
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.361
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

80
00:09:42.528 --> 00:09:45.573
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

81
00:09:45.573 --> 00:09:49.452
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

82
00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:06.302
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

83
00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:08.721
Those cuffs won't be necessary.

84
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:17.229
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

85
00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:23.194
We wish for you to act as our agent

86
00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:27.573
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

87
00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:30.034
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?

88
00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:33.037
We've had dealings in the past.

89
00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:37.625
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

90
00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:39.960
What mark did he leave on you?

91
00:10:42.588 --> 00:10:46.425
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

92
00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:48.511
I would like you to go to him

93
00:10:48.636 --> 00:10:53.224
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

94
00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:56.143
Recover. At the point of a sword?

95
00:10:56.602 --> 00:10:58.646
Bargain.

96
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.071
Letters of marque.

97
00:11:08.364 --> 00:11:10.950
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

98
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.204
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

99
00:11:15.996 --> 00:11:20.793
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

100
00:11:20.793 --> 00:11:22.962
Freedom.

101
00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:27.216
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

102
00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:29.176
The world is shrinking,

103
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.680
the blank edges of the map filled in.

104
00:11:32.847 --> 00:11:36.642
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

105
00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:39.603
Not unlike you, Mr Turner.

106
00:11:39.603 --> 00:11:42.565
You and your fiancee
face the hangman's noose.

107
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.903
- So you get both Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

108
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.241
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

109
00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:56.412
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

110
00:11:56.579 --> 00:12:00.124
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

111
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:02.835
A compass?

112
00:12:02.877 --> 00:12:05.004
You know it.

113
00:12:06.422 --> 00:12:10.676
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

114
00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:38.621
Why is the rum always gone?

115
00:12:46.962 --> 00:12:49.715
That's why.

116
00:12:55.638 --> 00:12:57.640
As you were, gents.

117
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.718
Time's run out, Jack.

118
00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:55.906
Bootstrap.

119
00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:58.075
Bill Turner.

120
00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:05.291
You look good, Jack.

121
00:14:11.964 --> 00:14:14.300
Is this a dream?

122
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.718
No.

123
00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:19.472
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

124
00:14:27.271 --> 00:14:29.690
You got the Pearl back, I see.

125
00:14:30.441 --> 00:14:34.278
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.

126
00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:37.823
Your son.

127
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.534
William?

128
00:14:41.327 --> 00:14:43.662
He ended up a pirate after all.

129
00:14:44.538 --> 00:14:48.459
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

130
00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:50.753
He sent me.

131
00:14:52.046 --> 00:14:54.715
Davy Jones.

132
00:14:57.468 --> 00:14:59.428
So it's you, then.

133
00:15:01.055 --> 00:15:04.392
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

134
00:15:04.392 --> 00:15:06.435
I chose it.

135
00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:11.524
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

136
00:15:12.358 --> 00:15:14.860
I stood up for you.

137
00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:17.822
Everything went wrong after that.

138
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.453
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

139
00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:27.456
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

140
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:30.084
Unable to move.

141
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.421
Unable to die, Jack.

142
00:15:33.504 --> 00:15:38.968
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

143
00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:41.929
I would trade anything for it.

144
00:15:43.973 --> 00:15:47.143
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

145
00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:49.937
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

146
00:15:50.062 --> 00:15:52.648
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

147
00:15:52.732 --> 00:15:54.859
13 years, you've been her captain.

148
00:15:54.859 --> 00:15:56.819
- Technically...
- Jack.

149
00:15:56.861 --> 00:15:59.321
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

150
00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:02.241
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

151
00:16:02.241 --> 00:16:06.537
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

152
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.123
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

153
00:16:09.165 --> 00:16:11.584
Then it's the locker for you!

154
00:16:11.667 --> 00:16:14.795
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

155
00:16:14.795 --> 00:16:19.300
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

156
00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:24.764
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

157
00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:27.641
I already told you, Jack.

158
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.937
Your time is up.

159
00:16:32.813 --> 00:16:34.815
It comes now,

160
00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:40.196
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

161
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.625
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

162
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.044
On deck! Scurry!

163
00:16:55.044 --> 00:16:59.632
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

164
00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:03.469
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

165
00:17:03.636 --> 00:17:08.099
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

166
00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.519
- Do we have a heading?
- Run! Land.

167
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.403
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

168
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.995
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

169
00:17:29.995 --> 00:17:32.331
Leave it!

170
00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:35.292
Run.

171
00:17:36.168 --> 00:17:39.255
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

172
00:17:47.972 --> 00:17:49.557
Jack?

173
00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:55.104
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

174
00:17:55.271 --> 00:17:56.939
Nothing.

175
00:19:10.304 --> 00:19:14.600
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.

176
00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:16.102
Mr Swann!

177
00:19:16.102 --> 00:19:18.270
Governor Swann, still.

178
00:19:18.354 --> 00:19:21.565
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

179
00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:25.319
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

180
00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:29.532
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

181
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.243
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

182
00:19:32.243 --> 00:19:35.955
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

183
00:19:36.122 --> 00:19:38.499
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

184
00:19:38.666 --> 00:19:40.876
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

185
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:44.922
does not mean that
he would do the same for anyone else.

186
00:19:44.964 --> 00:19:48.467
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

187
00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.555
I have faith in you.

188
00:19:52.555 --> 00:19:55.224
Both of you.

189
00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:59.478
Where will you find him?

190
00:19:59.562 --> 00:20:04.316
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

191
00:20:04.734 --> 00:20:08.112
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

192
00:20:08.154 --> 00:20:11.532
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

193
00:20:12.575 --> 00:20:16.704
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

194
00:20:23.127 --> 00:20:27.548
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

195
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:39.226
Captain Jack Sparrow?

196
00:20:40.269 --> 00:20:44.732
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

197
00:20:44.815 --> 00:20:48.694
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

198
00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:53.074
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

199
00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:55.159
Jack Sparrow?

200
00:20:55.284 --> 00:20:57.369
I haven't seen him in a month.

201
00:20:57.536 --> 00:21:01.290
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

202
00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:04.835
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

203
00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:07.588
but there's an island
just south of the straits

204
00:21:07.588 --> 00:21:10.508
where I trade spice for

205
00:21:10.508 --> 00:21:12.635
delicious long pork.

206
00:21:14.303 --> 00:21:18.432
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

207
00:21:18.474 --> 00:21:20.810
A ship with black sails.

208
00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:30.236
My brother will take you ashore.

209
00:21:40.996 --> 00:21:43.958
- What's wrong? The beach is right there.
- C'est trop dangereux.

210
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:47.503
- What?
- C'est trop dangereux. Je vous I'avais dit.

211
00:21:48.921 --> 00:21:51.006
Bon voyage. Monsieur.

212
00:22:15.948 --> 00:22:18.576
Jack!

213
00:22:18.576 --> 00:22:20.619
Jack Sparrow!

214
00:22:26.584 --> 00:22:28.502
Marty!

215
00:22:29.462 --> 00:22:31.088
Cotton!

216
00:22:32.047 --> 00:22:34.049
Anybody?

217
00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:42.058
A familiar face.

218
00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:43.934
Don't eat me.

219
00:22:44.018 --> 00:22:47.021
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

220
00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:49.565
No. Don't eat me.

221
00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:02.661
Gibbs.

222
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.860
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:23:37.947 --> 00:23:39.824
Come on! Who wants it?

224
00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:45.037
I can do this all day!

225
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.811
Jack?

226
00:24:50.978 --> 00:24:53.397
Jack Sparrow!

227
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.067
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

228
00:25:04.742 --> 00:25:06.744
Jack, it's me.

229
00:25:06.786 --> 00:25:08.245
Will Turner.

230
00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:17.088
Tell them to let me down!

231
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.217
...eensy-weensy.

232
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:29.350
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.

233
00:25:31.185 --> 00:25:33.479
Eunuchy.

234
00:25:36.357 --> 00:25:38.776
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.

235
00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:41.946
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for trying to help you.

236
00:25:42.071 --> 00:25:44.407
She faces the gallows!

237
00:25:52.081 --> 00:25:53.749
Savvy?

238
00:26:00.047 --> 00:26:02.466
Save me.

239
00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:04.718
Jack, what did you tell them?

240
00:26:04.802 --> 00:26:06.846
No!

241
00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:09.598
What about Elizabeth?

242
00:26:09.598 --> 00:26:11.142
Jack!

243
00:26:13.728 --> 00:26:16.313
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

244
00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:20.735
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

245
00:26:23.237 --> 00:26:25.823
Come quickly.

246
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.326
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing to the king.

247
00:26:29.326 --> 00:26:32.621
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

248
00:26:32.747 --> 00:26:34.874
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

249
00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:36.959
We cannot count on William Turner.

250
00:26:37.042 --> 00:26:40.212
- Come!
- He's better man than you give him credit for.

251
00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:43.716
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only

252
00:26:43.758 --> 00:26:46.093
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

253
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.928
Even if Will succeeds,

254
00:26:47.928 --> 00:26:54.143
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

255
00:26:54.226 --> 00:26:58.689
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

256
00:26:58.773 --> 00:27:03.861
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.

257
00:27:11.077 --> 00:27:13.162
Wait inside.

258
00:27:14.205 --> 00:27:16.290
Captain?

259
00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:20.628
Captain.

260
00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:28.761
Evening, Governor.

261
00:27:28.844 --> 00:27:30.846
Shame, that.

262
00:27:31.013 --> 00:27:33.182
He was carrying this.

263
00:27:33.224 --> 00:27:35.935
It's a letter to the king.

264
00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:38.396
- It's from you.
- No...

265
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.818
Elizabeth.

266
00:27:44.652 --> 00:27:47.113
What are you doing?

267
00:27:49.824 --> 00:27:52.368
- Where is she?
- Who?

268
00:28:09.927 --> 00:28:14.181
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

269
00:28:14.265 --> 00:28:16.517
as your father believes.

270
00:28:17.393 --> 00:28:20.062
Then what is?

271
00:28:20.104 --> 00:28:23.399
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

272
00:28:23.441 --> 00:28:28.654
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

273
00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:32.074
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

274
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.871
I'm listening intently.

275
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:41.167
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

276
00:28:41.292 --> 00:28:45.963
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

277
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.716
Or else I would not still be here.

278
00:28:48.883 --> 00:28:52.928
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

279
00:28:52.928 --> 00:28:56.682
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

280
00:28:56.766 --> 00:29:01.520
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

281
00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:05.941
- There is something you need to know.
- I see.

282
00:29:06.025 --> 00:29:09.153
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

283
00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:12.406
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

284
00:29:13.157 --> 00:29:15.534
But you mustn't worry.

285
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.538
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

286
00:29:19.538 --> 00:29:22.166
My desires are not so provincial.

287
00:29:22.792 --> 00:29:27.046
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

288
00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:32.343
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

289
00:29:34.845 --> 00:29:39.725
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

290
00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.894
So I did.

291
00:29:43.896 --> 00:29:46.273
A marriage interrupted

292
00:29:48.442 --> 00:29:51.278
or fate intervenes?

293
00:29:51.987 --> 00:29:55.199
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

294
00:29:55.282 --> 00:29:57.910
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Really?

295
00:29:58.077 --> 00:30:00.746
To ensure Mr Turner's freedom, then,

296
00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.375
I'll still want that compass.

297
00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:08.087
Consider that in your calculations.

298
00:30:27.648 --> 00:30:30.693
When I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

299
00:30:30.818 --> 00:30:33.529
And I say it was me being clever.

300
00:30:34.822 --> 00:30:37.324
Ain't that right, poochie?

301
00:30:37.491 --> 00:30:41.704
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

302
00:30:41.704 --> 00:30:43.956
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

303
00:30:44.081 --> 00:30:49.211
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

304
00:30:49.295 --> 00:30:54.008
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

305
00:30:54.133 --> 00:30:57.845
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

306
00:30:57.928 --> 00:31:03.476
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

307
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:06.937
Look.

308
00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:09.148
There it is.

309
00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:15.780
What's got into him?

310
00:31:15.863 --> 00:31:17.948
Must have seen a catfish.

311
00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:27.458
Stupid mongrel!

312
00:31:43.224 --> 00:31:45.351
Come on!

313
00:31:52.358 --> 00:31:56.529
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.

314
00:31:56.654 --> 00:31:59.490
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

315
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.492
There's the truth of it!

316
00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:12.002
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

317
00:32:12.086 --> 00:32:15.297
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

318
00:32:15.381 --> 00:32:18.008
Amen to that.

319
00:32:34.233 --> 00:32:36.318
Thank you.

320
00:32:53.127 --> 00:32:56.422
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

321
00:32:56.505 --> 00:32:58.924
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

322
00:32:58.966 --> 00:33:02.720
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

323
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.848
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

324
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:12.605
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

325
00:33:12.813 --> 00:33:18.694
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

326
00:33:22.323 --> 00:33:24.825
They'll roast him and eat him.

327
00:33:25.868 --> 00:33:27.620
Where's the rest of the crew?

328
00:33:27.703 --> 00:33:32.333
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

329
00:33:34.502 --> 00:33:36.879
The feast is about to begin.

330
00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:39.632
Jack's life will end

331
00:33:39.632 --> 00:33:42.093
when the drums stop.

332
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:46.430
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

333
00:33:48.808 --> 00:33:51.477
No, no. Oi! No, no.

334
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.730
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

335
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.816
I am Chief. Want big fire.

336
00:33:56.899 --> 00:33:59.193
Come on.

337
00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:04.865
Tout de suite.
Come on. More wood.

338
00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:15.394
Bugger.

339
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.448
A little seasoning, eh?

340
00:35:41.128 --> 00:35:42.713
Well done.

341
00:36:22.086 --> 00:36:25.423
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

342
00:36:26.549 --> 00:36:30.636
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

343
00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:33.556
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

344
00:36:33.597 --> 00:36:35.891
About six would do.

345
00:36:39.603 --> 00:36:41.355
Oh, dear.

346
00:36:44.734 --> 00:36:47.445
- Hurry!
- Come on!

347
00:36:51.157 --> 00:36:53.659
Come on! Is that all you got?

348
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.753
Wait. Stop.

349
00:37:04.253 --> 00:37:06.297
Stop.

350
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:21.062
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

351
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.570
Snake!

352
00:37:46.962 --> 00:37:48.798
Move!

353
00:38:15.032 --> 00:38:17.284
Well, go on, go get them.

354
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.959
No, no. Oi! No, no!

355
00:38:27.378 --> 00:38:29.046
Not good.

356
00:38:45.271 --> 00:38:47.523
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

357
00:39:06.584 --> 00:39:08.252
Roll the cage!

358
00:39:08.377 --> 00:39:10.755
Come on!

359
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:40.284
- Lift the cage! Hurry!
- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

360
00:40:36.424 --> 00:40:37.800
Run!

361
00:40:51.605 --> 00:40:54.400
This way, lads!

362
00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:18.340
Take cover!

363
00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:21.093
Stop it!

364
00:42:16.148 --> 00:42:17.691
Bugger.

365
00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:47.888
Haul loose the mooring line!

366
00:42:47.888 --> 00:42:50.224
The mooring line!

367
00:42:50.224 --> 00:42:53.936
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

368
00:42:53.936 --> 00:42:57.314
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

369
00:42:57.815 --> 00:43:00.067
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

370
00:43:00.067 --> 00:43:03.612
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

371
00:43:03.612 --> 00:43:06.198
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

372
00:43:06.198 --> 00:43:09.160
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

373
00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:11.495
I won't leave without him.

374
00:43:20.629 --> 00:43:23.591
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

375
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:34.226
Make ready to cast off!

376
00:43:39.065 --> 00:43:41.358
Good doggy.

377
00:43:56.874 --> 00:44:03.089
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day that you almost...

378
00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:08.344
Captain Jack Sparrow.

379
00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:37.206
Let's what some distance between us and this island
and head out to open sea.

380
00:44:37.331 --> 00:44:41.877
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but only in
so far as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.

381
00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:44.088
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

382
00:44:44.088 --> 00:44:47.299
I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills Master Gibbs.

383
00:44:47.383 --> 00:44:50.511
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

384
00:44:56.142 --> 00:44:58.394
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

385
00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:01.439
Have you considered keeping her or watch her
or maybe just locking her up somewhere?

386
00:45:01.439 --> 00:45:04.024
She is locked up in the prison,
bound to hang for helping you.

387
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:09.071
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

388
00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:12.825
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

389
00:45:12.867 --> 00:45:15.536
I must trade it for her freedom.

390
00:45:17.621 --> 00:45:20.374
- Mr Gibbs.
- Captain.

391
00:45:20.541 --> 00:45:23.461
We have a need to travel upriver.

392
00:45:23.627 --> 00:45:27.048
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

393
00:45:27.131 --> 00:45:30.926
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

394
00:45:31.093 --> 00:45:34.930
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

395
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.768
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

396
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:40.728
William,

397
00:45:40.853 --> 00:45:42.897
I shall trade you the compass

398
00:45:43.022 --> 00:45:44.815
if you will help me

399
00:45:44.899 --> 00:45:47.068
to find this.

400
00:45:50.738 --> 00:45:53.240
- You want me to find this?
- No.

401
00:45:54.408 --> 00:45:56.827
You want you to find this,

402
00:45:56.911 --> 00:46:01.040
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

403
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.755
and or locating in your discovering a detecting way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

404
00:46:07.838 --> 00:46:10.758
Savvy?

405
00:46:12.259 --> 00:46:14.762
This is going to save Elizabeth?

406
00:46:17.056 --> 00:46:20.059
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

407
00:46:22.395 --> 00:46:23.979
Not much.

408
00:46:23.979 --> 00:46:27.024
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

409
00:46:53.426 --> 00:46:56.053
What's all this?

410
00:46:56.595 --> 00:47:01.600
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

411
00:47:01.726 --> 00:47:04.937
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

412
00:47:05.688 --> 00:47:07.815
Is it, now? And you?

413
00:47:08.023 --> 00:47:11.986
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

414
00:47:12.194 --> 00:47:14.739
All the men, they can feel it.

415
00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:18.492
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

416
00:47:18.617 --> 00:47:21.036
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

417
00:47:21.036 --> 00:47:23.706
A virgin too, likely as not.

418
00:47:23.748 --> 00:47:26.041
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

419
00:47:26.125 --> 00:47:30.421
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

420
00:47:30.546 --> 00:47:33.382
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

421
00:47:33.466 --> 00:47:37.470
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then just get it back to her.

422
00:47:37.553 --> 00:47:39.930
Enough! Enough!

423
00:47:39.972 --> 00:47:44.310
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

424
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:47.480
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

425
00:47:47.646 --> 00:47:49.815
A young woman, by the look of it.

426
00:47:49.815 --> 00:47:52.526
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

427
00:47:52.526 --> 00:47:55.404
Oh, and she's probably naked.

428
00:48:25.226 --> 00:48:27.853
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

429
00:48:27.978 --> 00:48:30.398
Well, if you believe such things,

430
00:48:30.856 --> 00:48:33.609
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones

431
00:48:33.734 --> 00:48:38.364
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

432
00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:41.992
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

433
00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:45.871
The kraken.

434
00:48:48.082 --> 00:48:51.961
They say the stench of its breath is like...

435
00:48:52.169 --> 00:48:55.589
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

436
00:48:55.756 --> 00:49:01.637
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odour of a thousand rotting corpses.

437
00:49:03.597 --> 00:49:06.058
If you believe such things.

438
00:49:06.434 --> 00:49:08.936
And the key will spare him that?

439
00:49:09.103 --> 00:49:12.481
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

440
00:49:12.606 --> 00:49:15.109
Bad enough even to go visit

441
00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:18.195
her.

442
00:49:18.279 --> 00:49:20.114
Her?

443
00:49:20.197 --> 00:49:22.199
Aye.

444
00:49:57.151 --> 00:50:00.946
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

445
00:50:01.072 --> 00:50:04.950
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

446
00:50:05.034 --> 00:50:07.369
Were. Have been.

447
00:50:08.537 --> 00:50:09.622
Before.

448
00:50:09.705 --> 00:50:12.666
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

449
00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:15.252
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

450
00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.672
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

451
00:50:18.672 --> 00:50:20.049
Mind the boat.

452
00:50:20.966 --> 00:50:23.094
Mind the boat.

453
00:50:34.855 --> 00:50:38.192
Jack Sparrow.

454
00:50:38.192 --> 00:50:40.361
Tia Dalma.

455
00:50:41.153 --> 00:50:45.616
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

456
00:50:50.413 --> 00:50:52.289
You...

457
00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:57.378
You have a touch of

458
00:50:57.461 --> 00:51:00.840
destiny about you,

459
00:51:01.048 --> 00:51:02.925
William Turner.

460
00:51:04.593 --> 00:51:06.804
You know me?

461
00:51:06.887 --> 00:51:09.432
You want to know me.

462
00:51:09.557 --> 00:51:14.186
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

463
00:51:14.311 --> 00:51:17.940
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

464
00:51:18.065 --> 00:51:20.192
- Come.
- Come.

465
00:51:23.863 --> 00:51:28.451
What service may I do you?

466
00:51:29.076 --> 00:51:33.080
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.

467
00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:38.627
Look.

468
00:51:39.795 --> 00:51:42.298
An undead monkey.

469
00:51:42.339 --> 00:51:44.508
Top that.

470
00:51:48.429 --> 00:51:52.349
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

471
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.311
The payment is fair.

472
00:51:55.352 --> 00:51:57.396
We're looking for this.

473
00:52:00.024 --> 00:52:02.777
And what it goes to.

474
00:52:04.278 --> 00:52:08.991
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

475
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:12.536
Maybe. Why?

476
00:52:14.872 --> 00:52:19.377
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

477
00:52:19.919 --> 00:52:22.254
Or do you know,

478
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:26.342
but are loath to claim it as your own?

479
00:52:27.968 --> 00:52:29.970
Your key go to a chest.

480
00:52:30.596 --> 00:52:35.184
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

481
00:52:35.184 --> 00:52:38.187
- What is inside?
- Gold?

482
00:52:38.312 --> 00:52:42.316
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

483
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:45.694
Nothing bad, I hope?

484
00:52:46.362 --> 00:52:49.281
You know of Davy Jones,

485
00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:50.866
yes?

486
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.828
A man of the sea.

487
00:52:53.828 --> 00:52:56.122
A great sailor,

488
00:52:56.205 --> 00:53:01.168
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

489
00:53:01.293 --> 00:53:04.296
What vexes all men?

490
00:53:05.756 --> 00:53:08.342
What indeed?

491
00:53:08.884 --> 00:53:10.803
- The sea.
- Sums.

492
00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:13.931
The dichotomy of good and evil.

493
00:53:14.598 --> 00:53:16.267
A woman.

494
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.310
A woman.

495
00:53:18.352 --> 00:53:20.438
He fell in love.

496
00:53:20.604 --> 00:53:23.566
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

497
00:53:23.566 --> 00:53:27.403
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

498
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.947
See, it was a woman

499
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.825
as changing and harsh

500
00:53:32.825 --> 00:53:36.245
and untamable as the sea.

501
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.873
Him never stopped loving her.

502
00:53:38.914 --> 00:53:43.627
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

503
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:46.380
but not enough to cause him to die.

504
00:53:48.215 --> 00:53:52.678
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

505
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.722
Him heart.

506
00:53:54.805 --> 00:53:56.891
Literally or figuratively?

507
00:53:56.932 --> 00:54:01.520
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

508
00:54:01.562 --> 00:54:03.689
Could he?

509
00:54:03.731 --> 00:54:09.820
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

510
00:54:09.904 --> 00:54:11.655
And so

511
00:54:11.655 --> 00:54:14.325
him carve out him heart,

512
00:54:14.909 --> 00:54:19.663
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

513
00:54:20.414 --> 00:54:22.666
The key

514
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:27.129
he keep with him at all times.

515
00:54:27.713 --> 00:54:31.467
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

516
00:54:31.634 --> 00:54:35.846
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

517
00:54:35.888 --> 00:54:38.682
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

518
00:54:38.766 --> 00:54:41.602
Let me see your hand.

519
00:54:55.282 --> 00:54:57.743
The black spot!

520
00:54:58.786 --> 00:55:02.331
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

521
00:55:02.706 --> 00:55:05.835
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

522
00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:09.380
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

523
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.262
My little beauty, where are you?

524
00:55:16.303 --> 00:55:19.932
Such a long time in such a mess.

525
00:55:22.017 --> 00:55:24.895
Davy Jones cannot make port.

526
00:55:24.979 --> 00:55:28.315
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

527
00:55:28.816 --> 00:55:32.069
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

528
00:55:32.194 --> 00:55:34.697
and so you will carry land with you.

529
00:55:43.956 --> 00:55:45.958
Dirt.

530
00:55:47.084 --> 00:55:50.713
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

531
00:55:53.007 --> 00:55:55.926
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

532
00:55:55.968 --> 00:55:58.888
If you don't want it, give it back.

533
00:55:59.513 --> 00:56:02.683
- No.
- Then it helps.

534
00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:09.940
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

535
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:16.864
A touch of destiny.

536
00:56:32.421 --> 00:56:34.882
That's the Flying Dutchman?

537
00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:39.553
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

538
00:56:39.553 --> 00:56:42.014
Do not underestimate her.

539
00:56:43.391 --> 00:56:47.812
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

540
00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:51.482
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

541
00:56:51.524 --> 00:56:53.901
And if there are crewmen?

542
00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:56.195
I cut down anyone in my path.

543
00:56:56.987 --> 00:56:59.990
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

544
00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:03.077
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

545
00:57:07.707 --> 00:57:13.295
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

546
00:57:13.337 --> 00:57:17.299
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

547
00:57:21.262 --> 00:57:23.806
Douse the lamps.

548
00:58:05.514 --> 00:58:06.599
Sailor.

549
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.310
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

550
00:58:09.351 --> 00:58:11.771
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

551
00:58:11.771 --> 00:58:14.565
There's no use.
You've run aground.

552
00:58:14.607 --> 00:58:16.067
No.

553
00:58:16.233 --> 00:58:18.235
Beneath us.

554
00:58:19.153 --> 00:58:21.572
Foul breath.

555
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:16.961
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

556
00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:35.855
Get back! Get back!

557
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:11.098
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

558
01:00:28.199 --> 01:00:31.410
Do you fear death?

559
01:00:32.787 --> 01:00:37.666
Do you fear that dark abyss?

560
01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:42.296
All your deeds laid bare.

561
01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:46.217
All your sins punished.

562
01:00:48.052 --> 01:00:50.471
I can offer you

563
01:00:50.638 --> 01:00:53.140
an escape.

564
01:00:53.224 --> 01:00:56.310
Don't listen to him!

565
01:01:04.902 --> 01:01:07.947
Do you not fear death?

566
01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.910
I'll take my chances, sir.

567
01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:15.454
To the depths.

568
01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:22.920
Cruel blackguard!

569
01:01:23.087 --> 01:01:25.214
Life is cruel.

570
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:28.926
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

571
01:01:29.427 --> 01:01:32.555
I offer you a choice.

572
01:01:32.638 --> 01:01:35.349
Join my crew

573
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.893
and postpone the judgment.

574
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:42.648
One hundred years before the mast.

575
01:01:45.025 --> 01:01:47.027
Will ye serve?

576
01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.781
I will serve.

577
01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:03.669
You are neither dead nor dying.

578
01:02:03.794 --> 01:02:06.464
What is your purpose here?

579
01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:12.344
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

580
01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:16.724
What is your purpose here?

581
01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:19.977
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

582
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.566
Did he, now?

583
01:02:25.691 --> 01:02:29.153
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

584
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:48.798
You have a debt to pay.

585
01:02:48.923 --> 01:02:52.343
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.

586
01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:54.512
That was our agreement.

587
01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:58.432
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.

588
01:02:58.516 --> 01:03:02.269
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

589
01:03:02.395 --> 01:03:05.648
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

590
01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:08.317
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

591
01:03:11.237 --> 01:03:14.240
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.

592
01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.867
One soul is not equal to another.

593
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:24.250
So we've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

594
01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:26.877
Price?

595
01:03:28.879 --> 01:03:32.425
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

596
01:03:36.178 --> 01:03:38.764
One hundred souls.

597
01:03:39.765 --> 01:03:41.475
Three days.

598
01:03:41.934 --> 01:03:45.855
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

599
01:03:45.896 --> 01:03:49.108
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

600
01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:51.819
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

601
01:03:54.905 --> 01:03:56.949
Have you not met Will Turner?

602
01:03:56.991 --> 01:03:59.785
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

603
01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:02.329
Worth at least four.

604
01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.707
Maybe three and a half.

605
01:04:05.499 --> 01:04:08.335
And did I happen to mention

606
01:04:08.502 --> 01:04:11.005
he's in love?

607
01:04:11.797 --> 01:04:14.383
With a girl.

608
01:04:14.467 --> 01:04:16.969
Due to be married.

609
01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:19.055
Betrothed.

610
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:24.518
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

611
01:04:24.685 --> 01:04:29.523
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?

612
01:04:33.486 --> 01:04:38.449
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

613
01:04:38.532 --> 01:04:41.243
But I wonder, Sparrow,

614
01:04:41.327 --> 01:04:43.537
can you live with this?

615
01:04:44.288 --> 01:04:48.167
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

616
01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:53.089
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

617
01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.386
Yep. I'm good with it.

618
01:04:58.386 --> 01:05:01.639
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean ink.

619
01:05:05.976 --> 01:05:08.604
Three days.

620
01:05:13.234 --> 01:05:15.361
Three days.

621
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:25.830
- Mr Gibbs.
- Aye.

622
01:05:25.996 --> 01:05:28.624
I feel sullied and unusual.

623
01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:34.422
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

624
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:40.678
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

625
01:05:40.678 --> 01:05:42.722
Tortuga.

626
01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.182
Tortuga.

627
01:05:49.228 --> 01:05:52.898
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

628
01:05:52.898 --> 01:05:56.152
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

629
01:05:56.152 --> 01:06:00.614
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

630
01:06:00.698 --> 01:06:05.244
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

631
01:06:05.244 --> 01:06:07.830
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

632
01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:13.419
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

633
01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:16.130
Sir!

634
01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:41.906
She wants you to do something.

635
01:06:44.992 --> 01:06:47.620
She's trying to give a sign.

636
01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.547
Over there! Look for a sign!

637
01:07:03.302 --> 01:07:05.554
Look, there! There it is!

638
01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.557
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

639
01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:11.685
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

640
01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:16.816
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

641
01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:38.295
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

642
01:07:38.379 --> 01:07:40.715
I've never sailed a day in me life.

643
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.926
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

644
01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:47.388
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

645
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:50.224
My wife ran off with my dog

646
01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:53.185
and I'm drunk for a month

647
01:07:53.227 --> 01:07:55.312
and I don't give an ass rat's

648
01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:57.398
if I live or die.

649
01:07:57.398 --> 01:08:00.443
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

650
01:08:00.526 --> 01:08:04.697
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

651
01:08:04.697 --> 01:08:06.824
- I know what I want.
- Next!

652
01:08:07.032 --> 01:08:12.663
Ever since I was a little lad,
I've always wanted to sail the seas forever.

653
01:08:12.663 --> 01:08:15.416
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

654
01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:17.752
Thanks very much.

655
01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:22.923
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

656
01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.721
And what's your story?

657
01:08:28.763 --> 01:08:31.265
My story.

658
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:36.437
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

659
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.107
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

660
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.110
The pursuit cost me my crew,

661
01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:45.821
my commission,

662
01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.990
and my life.

663
01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:57.958
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

664
01:09:00.878 --> 01:09:03.464
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

665
01:09:04.215 --> 01:09:08.844
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

666
01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:10.262
Lord.

667
01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:12.348
You didn't try to sail through it?

668
01:09:12.556 --> 01:09:14.975
So, do I make your crew

669
01:09:15.101 --> 01:09:17.103
or not?

670
01:09:17.978 --> 01:09:20.689
You haven't said where you're going.

671
01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.900
Somewhere nice?!

672
01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:26.320
So, am I worthy to serve

673
01:09:26.404 --> 01:09:29.240
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

674
01:09:31.617 --> 01:09:35.121
Or should I just kill you now?

675
01:09:41.168 --> 01:09:43.295
You're hired.

676
01:09:43.421 --> 01:09:47.425
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

677
01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:51.137
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

678
01:10:04.275 --> 01:10:06.235
- Time to go.
- Aye!

679
01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:52.907
Thanks, mate.

680
01:10:58.662 --> 01:11:00.539
Carry on.

681
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.383
Come on, then! Who wants some?

682
01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:13.969
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

683
01:11:14.053 --> 01:11:16.347
Come on, who's first?

684
01:11:19.058 --> 01:11:22.520
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

685
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.924
James Norrington.

686
01:11:52.758 --> 01:11:55.886
What has the world done to you?

687
01:12:23.998 --> 01:12:26.333
Heave!

688
01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:28.753
Heave!

689
01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.422
Heave!

690
01:12:31.672 --> 01:12:33.591
Heave!

691
01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:38.095
- Heave!
- Heave!

692
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:45.019
Secure the mast tackle, Mr Turner!

693
01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.107
Set to it!

694
01:12:55.446 --> 01:12:58.282
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

695
01:12:58.866 --> 01:13:01.202
Let go, boy!

696
01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:06.040
No.

697
01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:16.550
Haul that weevil to his feet.

698
01:13:22.223 --> 01:13:25.601
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

699
01:13:25.684 --> 01:13:30.856
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

700
01:13:30.856 --> 01:13:34.777
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

701
01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:37.196
Will you, now?

702
01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:42.576
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

703
01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:48.124
My son.

704
01:13:53.087 --> 01:13:55.339
He's my son.

705
01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:10.020
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

706
01:14:10.062 --> 01:14:13.983
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

707
01:14:18.863 --> 01:14:21.407
No. No, I won't!

708
01:14:21.532 --> 01:14:24.201
The cat's out of the bag, Mr Turner.

709
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:30.124
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

710
01:14:33.961 --> 01:14:36.297
No.

711
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.382
- Bosun!
- No!

712
01:15:22.676 --> 01:15:26.013
You had it easy, boy!

713
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:29.058
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

714
01:15:30.851 --> 01:15:37.149
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

715
01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:42.279
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

716
01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:44.407
Yes.

717
01:15:50.454 --> 01:15:56.293
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

718
01:15:56.419 --> 01:16:00.256
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

719
01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:06.137
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

720
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:09.265
Not until your debt is paid.

721
01:16:09.348 --> 01:16:11.767
I've sworn no oath.

722
01:16:13.561 --> 01:16:15.688
Then you must get away.

723
01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:18.858
Not until I find this.

724
01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:22.403
The key.

725
01:16:29.577 --> 01:16:32.121
The dead man's chest.

726
01:16:33.205 --> 01:16:35.332
What do you know of this?

727
01:16:35.332 --> 01:16:40.087
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

728
01:16:40.212 --> 01:16:43.257
No, don't stab the heart.

729
01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:48.471
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

730
01:16:48.596 --> 01:16:52.808
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

731
01:16:53.267 --> 01:16:55.811
So the captain has the key?

732
01:16:57.063 --> 01:16:59.857
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

733
01:17:00.232 --> 01:17:03.027
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

734
01:17:06.363 --> 01:17:08.032
Captain Sparrow!

735
01:17:08.032 --> 01:17:10.618
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

736
01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:13.371
I'm here to find the man I love.

737
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:18.876
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

738
01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.090
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

739
01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:25.549
Elizabeth.

740
01:17:25.591 --> 01:17:28.094
Hide the rum.

741
01:17:28.094 --> 01:17:31.097
You know these clothes do not flatter you at all.
It should be a dress or nothing.

742
01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:34.266
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

743
01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:39.647
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

744
01:17:39.814 --> 01:17:43.359
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but

745
01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:50.324
through unfortunate entirely unforcibly circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

746
01:17:50.449 --> 01:17:55.204
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

747
01:17:56.247 --> 01:17:58.082
Davy Jones?

748
01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.919
Oh, please.

749
01:18:03.003 --> 01:18:05.381
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

750
01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:08.926
- You look very awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.

751
01:18:09.009 --> 01:18:11.220
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

752
01:18:11.303 --> 01:18:14.223
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

753
01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:17.351
All I want is to find Will.

754
01:18:20.813 --> 01:18:25.317
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

755
01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:28.612
Of course.

756
01:18:28.612 --> 01:18:32.908
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

757
01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:37.496
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well,

758
01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:40.624
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

759
01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:43.127
A chest of unknown size and origin.

760
01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:48.090
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

761
01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:51.427
And whoever possesses that chest

762
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:55.431
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

763
01:18:55.514 --> 01:19:00.436
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

764
01:19:00.519 --> 01:19:04.106
You don't actually believe him, do you?

765
01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:11.238
How would we find it?

766
01:19:13.324 --> 01:19:15.242
With this.

767
01:19:15.368 --> 01:19:18.287
My compass is unique.

768
01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:21.999
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

769
01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:27.505
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

770
01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.426
Where does it point?

771
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:37.348
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

772
01:19:40.434 --> 01:19:42.144
Jack.

773
01:19:43.938 --> 01:19:47.775
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

774
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.319
And what you want most in this world

775
01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:56.117
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

776
01:19:56.117 --> 01:20:01.205
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

777
01:20:16.762 --> 01:20:19.056
- Mr Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

778
01:20:19.223 --> 01:20:21.392
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

779
01:20:21.434 --> 01:20:26.063
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

780
01:20:26.147 --> 01:20:28.107
Miss Swann.

781
01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:33.821
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

782
01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:45.374
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it. Don't you agree?

783
01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:48.085
I assure you, these are not necessary.

784
01:20:48.085 --> 01:20:52.673
I had you brought here I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

785
01:20:52.757 --> 01:20:56.218
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on the arm of Tortuga,

786
01:20:56.302 --> 01:21:00.264
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

787
01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:03.267
and other fugitives from justice.

788
01:21:03.434 --> 01:21:05.227
"Justice"? Hardly.

789
01:21:05.269 --> 01:21:11.108
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

790
01:21:11.525 --> 01:21:16.364
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

791
01:21:16.489 --> 01:21:20.326
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

792
01:21:20.534 --> 01:21:26.582
I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

793
01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:31.629
What do you want from me?

794
01:21:31.796 --> 01:21:34.882
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

795
01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:38.636
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

796
01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.139
To you, you mean.

797
01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:48.562
Shall I remove these shackles?

798
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:55.152
Do what you can for my daughter.

799
01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:06.455
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

800
01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:10.376
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

801
01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:19.135
I wager ten years.

802
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:22.346
I'll match ten years.

803
01:22:23.347 --> 01:22:24.974
Agreed.

804
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.813
Wondering how it's played?

805
01:22:30.855 --> 01:22:32.773
- I understand.
- Liar!

806
01:22:32.898 --> 01:22:38.362
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

807
01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:41.866
- What are they wagering?
- The only thing we have.

808
01:22:42.033 --> 01:22:44.368
Years of service.

809
01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:50.624
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

810
01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:56.338
I challenge Davy Jones.

811
01:23:15.858 --> 01:23:18.861
I accept, mate.

812
01:23:30.498 --> 01:23:36.003
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

813
01:23:36.128 --> 01:23:38.255
No!

814
01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:42.009
Against?

815
01:23:43.469 --> 01:23:45.513
I want this.

816
01:23:57.566 --> 01:24:02.571
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

817
01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:08.327
You can still walk away.

818
01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:36.230
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

819
01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:39.191
No! Don't do this.

820
01:24:41.026 --> 01:24:43.821
The die is cast.

821
01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:46.991
I bid three twos.

822
01:24:47.074 --> 01:24:49.243
It's your bid, Captain.

823
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:58.461
Four fours.

824
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.848
Four fives.

825
01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:12.600
Six threes.

826
01:25:22.193 --> 01:25:25.363
Seven fives.

827
01:25:49.303 --> 01:25:51.597
Eight fives.

828
01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:59.772
Welcome to the crew, lad.

829
01:26:02.024 --> 01:26:04.944
Twelve fives.

830
01:26:05.236 --> 01:26:06.946
Twelve fives.

831
01:26:07.071 --> 01:26:09.824
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

832
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.662
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

833
01:26:18.207 --> 01:26:23.087
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

834
01:26:25.005 --> 01:26:29.260
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore

835
01:26:30.511 --> 01:26:33.639
the very next time we make port!

836
01:26:41.313 --> 01:26:44.775
Fool. Why did you do that?

837
01:26:46.318 --> 01:26:48.654
I couldn't let you lose.

838
01:26:48.654 --> 01:26:51.365
It was never about winning or losing.

839
01:26:53.868 --> 01:26:55.161
The key.

840
01:26:56.954 --> 01:26:59.790
You just wanted to know where it was.

841
01:27:19.393 --> 01:27:22.063
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

842
01:27:25.983 --> 01:27:28.069
Captain's orders.

843
01:29:17.845 --> 01:29:20.389
Here. Take this, too.

844
01:29:21.432 --> 01:29:24.810
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

845
01:29:25.227 --> 01:29:28.522
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

846
01:29:28.606 --> 01:29:31.609
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

847
01:29:36.322 --> 01:29:40.201
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

848
01:29:40.242 --> 01:29:46.332
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

849
01:29:47.333 --> 01:29:51.629
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

850
01:29:53.339 --> 01:29:56.050
You owe me nothing, Will.

851
01:29:56.133 --> 01:29:58.344
Now go.

852
01:29:59.428 --> 01:30:02.098
They'll know you helped me.

853
01:30:03.474 --> 01:30:05.518
What more can they do to me?

854
01:30:11.357 --> 01:30:13.651
I take this with a promise.

855
01:30:13.734 --> 01:30:16.112
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

856
01:30:16.195 --> 01:30:20.032
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

857
01:30:21.575 --> 01:30:23.869
I will not abandon you.

858
01:30:26.622 --> 01:30:29.125
I promise.

859
01:30:43.222 --> 01:30:45.391
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

860
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:49.478
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

861
01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:53.399
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

862
01:30:53.691 --> 01:30:57.570
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

863
01:30:57.611 --> 01:31:00.197
Of course.

864
01:31:00.197 --> 01:31:03.993
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

865
01:31:04.076 --> 01:31:07.705
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

866
01:31:07.788 --> 01:31:11.584
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

867
01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:15.254
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

868
01:31:15.337 --> 01:31:18.674
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

869
01:31:18.716 --> 01:31:20.843
Brace the foreyard!

870
01:31:20.968 --> 01:31:24.138
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

871
01:31:24.138 --> 01:31:26.182
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

872
01:31:26.223 --> 01:31:27.850
Decidedly not.

873
01:31:27.933 --> 01:31:33.481
Will strikes a deal for this and uphold it on that,
yet you were the one standing with the prize, full pardon.

874
01:31:33.564 --> 01:31:35.900
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

875
01:31:36.067 --> 01:31:38.778
and the East India Trading Company."

876
01:31:38.819 --> 01:31:41.155
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

877
01:31:41.238 --> 01:31:43.783
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

878
01:31:43.783 --> 01:31:46.160
Persuade me.

879
01:31:46.243 --> 01:31:49.955
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

880
01:31:52.375 --> 01:31:56.128
As I said, persuade me.

881
01:32:10.309 --> 01:32:12.853
It's a curious thing.

882
01:32:13.938 --> 01:32:19.610
There was a time I would have give anything to you
to look like that while thinking about me.

883
01:32:19.694 --> 01:32:22.071
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

884
01:32:22.113 --> 01:32:24.949
Don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

885
01:32:29.578 --> 01:32:31.872
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancee

886
01:32:32.039 --> 01:32:36.043
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

887
01:33:00.568 --> 01:33:03.946
Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open water.

888
01:33:03.946 --> 01:33:07.324
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

889
01:33:07.324 --> 01:33:10.494
And what are we running from?

890
01:33:15.374 --> 01:33:18.127
That dress. Where did you get it?

891
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:19.837
It was found aboard the ship.

892
01:33:20.004 --> 01:33:24.425
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

893
01:33:24.425 --> 01:33:28.012
- That's foolish.
- Yes. Exceedingly foolish.

894
01:33:28.137 --> 01:33:34.101
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

895
01:33:34.226 --> 01:33:36.270
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

896
01:33:36.312 --> 01:33:39.440
Off the books, of course.

897
01:33:39.523 --> 01:33:43.235
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

898
01:33:43.319 --> 01:33:46.238
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

899
01:33:46.364 --> 01:33:49.200
- Colours?
- She isn't flying any.

900
01:33:49.283 --> 01:33:51.118
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

901
01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:06.217
You will watch this.

902
01:34:13.432 --> 01:34:16.352
Let no joyful voice be heard!

903
01:34:18.521 --> 01:34:21.816
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

904
01:34:23.984 --> 01:34:29.782
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake

905
01:34:31.283 --> 01:34:33.369
the kraken.

906
01:34:33.828 --> 01:34:35.538
No!

907
01:34:52.346 --> 01:34:54.974
I've doomed us all.

908
01:34:55.224 --> 01:34:58.269
It's the Flying Dutchman!

909
01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:05.609
Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

910
01:35:05.693 --> 01:35:08.237
Must have hit a reef.

911
01:35:15.911 --> 01:35:18.914
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

912
01:35:18.998 --> 01:35:22.460
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

913
01:35:29.675 --> 01:35:33.220
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

914
01:35:46.650 --> 01:35:49.695
Here it is! Take it!

915
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:51.739
Take it!

916
01:38:03.662 --> 01:38:08.167
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

917
01:38:08.292 --> 01:38:10.753
I am the sea.

918
01:38:14.465 --> 01:38:17.760
You need time alone with your thoughts.

919
01:38:17.843 --> 01:38:20.388
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

920
01:38:25.893 --> 01:38:29.188
There are no survivors.

921
01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:53.295
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

922
01:38:53.462 --> 01:38:56.132
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

923
01:38:56.173 --> 01:38:57.925
"First"?

924
01:38:58.092 --> 01:39:01.345
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

925
01:39:01.387 --> 01:39:03.431
Who told him of the key?

926
01:39:06.517 --> 01:39:08.644
Jack Sparrow.

927
01:39:26.996 --> 01:39:33.794
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

928
01:39:33.919 --> 01:39:37.339
I just thought I'd be married by now.

929
01:39:37.381 --> 01:39:39.717
I'm so ready to be married.

930
01:39:47.266 --> 01:39:49.310
You know...

931
01:39:50.895 --> 01:39:56.359
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

932
01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:04.825
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

933
01:40:04.992 --> 01:40:07.370
Right on this deck.

934
01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:09.413
Right now.

935
01:40:13.084 --> 01:40:15.336
No, thank you.

936
01:40:15.419 --> 01:40:17.004
Why not?

937
01:40:17.129 --> 01:40:20.883
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

938
01:40:20.925 --> 01:40:25.388
Except for a sense of honour
and decency and a moral centre.

939
01:40:25.721 --> 01:40:28.265
And personal hygiene.

940
01:40:29.642 --> 01:40:31.936
Trifles.

941
01:40:32.019 --> 01:40:34.647
You will come over to my side. I know it.

942
01:40:34.647 --> 01:40:39.944
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

943
01:40:40.027 --> 01:40:41.737
You long for freedom.

944
01:40:41.737 --> 01:40:44.865
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

945
01:40:44.865 --> 01:40:47.993
To act on selfish impulse.

946
01:40:47.993 --> 01:40:50.788
You want to see what it's like.

947
01:40:50.913 --> 01:40:55.292
One day, you won't be able to resist.

948
01:40:55.835 --> 01:40:58.421
Why doesn't your compass work?

949
01:41:00.089 --> 01:41:03.217
My compass works fine.

950
01:41:03.676 --> 01:41:05.469
Because you and I are alike,

951
01:41:05.553 --> 01:41:08.848
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

952
01:41:08.889 --> 01:41:12.143
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

953
01:41:12.643 --> 01:41:14.979
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

954
01:41:15.146 --> 01:41:20.568
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

955
01:41:20.693 --> 01:41:23.863
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

956
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:26.574
That you're a good man.

957
01:41:26.615 --> 01:41:29.118
All evidence to the contrary.

958
01:41:29.201 --> 01:41:32.288
I have faith in you.

959
01:41:32.371 --> 01:41:35.291
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

960
01:41:36.959 --> 01:41:39.920
Curiosity.

961
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:43.049
You're going to want it.

962
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:47.011
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

963
01:41:48.471 --> 01:41:50.639
You won't be able to resist.

964
01:41:52.016 --> 01:41:57.229
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

965
01:41:59.732 --> 01:42:02.693
I do want to know what it tastes like.

966
01:42:02.777 --> 01:42:04.570
But, seeing as you're a good man,

967
01:42:04.612 --> 01:42:09.075
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honour.

968
01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:19.543
I'm proud of you, Jack.

969
01:42:19.585 --> 01:42:22.380
Land, ho!

970
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:29.387
I want my jar of dirt.

971
01:42:30.846 --> 01:42:33.808
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

972
01:42:33.891 --> 01:42:39.063
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

973
01:42:39.105 --> 01:42:43.609
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

974
01:42:43.651 --> 01:42:45.194
With a long a?

975
01:42:45.319 --> 01:42:49.115
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian,

976
01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:50.991
and "kracken" is closer to that.

977
01:42:51.158 --> 01:42:54.620
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

978
01:42:54.704 --> 01:42:57.331
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

979
01:43:01.168 --> 01:43:03.421
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

980
01:43:03.504 --> 01:43:05.840
Don't touch my dirt.

981
01:43:41.792 --> 01:43:46.964
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

982
01:43:51.177 --> 01:43:54.472
Yes, it does. You're sitting on it.

983
01:43:55.306 --> 01:43:57.183
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

984
01:44:04.815 --> 01:44:07.651
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

985
01:44:07.651 --> 01:44:09.487
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

986
01:44:13.741 --> 01:44:18.454
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

987
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:20.539
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

988
01:44:20.706 --> 01:44:24.001
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

989
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:28.589
- Down, then!
- Down!

990
01:45:38.325 --> 01:45:40.411
It's real.

991
01:45:41.328 --> 01:45:43.414
You actually were telling the truth.

992
01:45:43.497 --> 01:45:47.001
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

993
01:45:47.126 --> 01:45:49.962
With good reason!

994
01:45:50.087 --> 01:45:52.506
Will!

995
01:45:52.673 --> 01:45:56.469
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

996
01:46:02.516 --> 01:46:04.602
How did you get here?

997
01:46:04.643 --> 01:46:08.647
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

998
01:46:08.773 --> 01:46:10.566
Not so easy, is it?

999
01:46:10.733 --> 01:46:13.319
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1000
01:46:13.444 --> 01:46:17.573
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1001
01:46:17.656 --> 01:46:19.742
- What?
- What?

1002
01:46:20.326 --> 01:46:23.454
...I was reunited with my father.

1003
01:46:23.537 --> 01:46:25.831
Well, you're welcome, then.

1004
01:46:26.290 --> 01:46:30.086
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1005
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:31.712
Pretty much.

1006
01:46:31.796 --> 01:46:34.173
Time and tide, love.

1007
01:46:34.215 --> 01:46:36.425
Oi! What are you doing?

1008
01:46:37.468 --> 01:46:39.887
I'm gonna to kill Jones.

1009
01:46:40.846 --> 01:46:43.265
Can't let you do that, William.

1010
01:46:43.265 --> 01:46:49.438
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1011
01:46:55.444 --> 01:46:58.739
Now, if you please.

1012
01:46:59.365 --> 01:47:01.951
The key.

1013
01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.914
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1014
01:47:06.914 --> 01:47:10.209
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1015
01:47:10.334 --> 01:47:13.963
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1016
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:17.591
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1017
01:47:18.384 --> 01:47:22.346
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1018
01:47:22.513 --> 01:47:25.683
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1019
01:47:27.226 --> 01:47:28.769
The dark side of ambition.

1020
01:47:28.894 --> 01:47:32.606
I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1021
01:47:36.944 --> 01:47:38.487
Stop it!

1022
01:47:45.161 --> 01:47:46.746
Will!

1023
01:47:47.663 --> 01:47:50.791
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1024
01:47:50.916 --> 01:47:56.547
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1025
01:47:56.589 --> 01:48:01.427
Fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1026
01:48:01.427 --> 01:48:04.096
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1027
01:48:04.221 --> 01:48:09.226
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1028
01:48:11.812 --> 01:48:17.026
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1029
01:48:17.151 --> 01:48:20.237
Mr Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honour,

1030
01:48:20.321 --> 01:48:22.865
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1031
01:48:22.907 --> 01:48:27.078
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1032
01:48:27.161 --> 01:48:30.748
'twixt him and his twice-cursed
pirate father.

1033
01:48:30.873 --> 01:48:32.792
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1034
01:48:32.958 --> 01:48:36.754
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1035
01:48:36.796 --> 01:48:38.756
Terrible temptation.

1036
01:48:38.798 --> 01:48:44.762
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1037
01:48:50.434 --> 01:48:52.311
Enough!

1038
01:48:58.693 --> 01:49:01.153
The heat!

1039
01:49:20.256 --> 01:49:22.383
Bugger!

1040
01:49:34.603 --> 01:49:36.981
By your leave, Mr Turner.

1041
01:50:23.903 --> 01:50:27.073
By your leave, Mr Norrington.

1042
01:51:19.125 --> 01:51:22.128
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

1043
01:51:22.128 --> 01:51:26.257
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1044
01:51:26.674 --> 01:51:32.054
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1045
01:51:32.221 --> 01:51:39.020
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1046
01:51:40.187 --> 01:51:42.732
So whose fault is it, really,

1047
01:51:42.815 --> 01:51:47.153
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

1048
01:51:47.319 --> 01:51:49.238
Enough!

1049
01:51:51.532 --> 01:51:55.327
Unfortunately, Mr Turner, he's right!

1050
01:51:57.413 --> 01:51:59.248
Still rooting for you, mate.

1051
01:52:57.390 --> 01:53:00.226
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1052
01:53:14.573 --> 01:53:17.660
Hello, poppet.

1053
01:53:44.395 --> 01:53:46.397
Come on, run!

1054
01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:31.150
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1055
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:36.655
Sword!

1056
01:55:17.363 --> 01:55:20.032
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

1057
01:55:20.074 --> 01:55:22.326
To the left... no, turn around.

1058
01:55:22.368 --> 01:55:24.495
Go to the right.

1059
01:55:24.537 --> 01:55:27.123
No, that's a tree.

1060
01:55:27.206 --> 01:55:28.666
Shut it.

1061
01:56:18.257 --> 01:56:20.634
Jar of dirt!

1062
01:57:20.653 --> 01:57:22.697
Right.

1063
01:57:55.855 --> 01:57:58.149
We've got it!

1064
01:58:07.783 --> 01:58:10.786
Come on, Turner!

1065
01:58:26.969 --> 01:58:31.640
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1066
01:58:32.058 --> 01:58:34.769
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

1067
01:58:34.769 --> 01:58:36.771
Into the boat.

1068
01:58:36.854 --> 01:58:39.774
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

1069
01:58:45.905 --> 01:58:49.658
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1070
01:58:59.043 --> 01:59:01.504
Your bravery is wasted.

1071
01:59:02.838 --> 01:59:09.261
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1072
01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.932
Here you go!

1073
01:59:24.819 --> 01:59:26.570
Pirates!

1074
01:59:44.505 --> 01:59:48.050
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

1075
01:59:48.467 --> 01:59:51.762
- You're pulling too hard!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

1076
01:59:52.179 --> 01:59:55.266
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1077
01:59:55.266 --> 01:59:57.518
My prayers be with him.

1078
01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:59.562
Best not wallow in our grief.

1079
01:59:59.729 --> 02:00:04.525
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

1080
02:00:19.874 --> 02:00:22.209
Lord on high, deliver us.

1081
02:00:25.379 --> 02:00:27.256
I'll handle this, mate.

1082
02:00:29.508 --> 02:00:31.135
Oi, fishface!

1083
02:00:32.636 --> 02:00:35.222
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!

1084
02:00:40.561 --> 02:00:42.521
Got it!

1085
02:00:43.731 --> 02:00:46.776
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1086
02:00:46.859 --> 02:00:48.361
Look what I got.

1087
02:00:48.402 --> 02:00:51.447
I got a jar of dirt.
I got a jar of dirt

1088
02:00:51.655 --> 02:00:53.532
And guess what's inside it?

1089
02:00:54.367 --> 02:00:55.910
Enough!

1090
02:01:03.959 --> 02:01:06.712
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

1091
02:01:06.879 --> 02:01:10.007
Brace up the foreyard!

1092
02:01:13.135 --> 02:01:15.179
Hard to starboard!

1093
02:01:15.221 --> 02:01:20.142
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.

1094
02:01:32.238 --> 02:01:36.158
She's on us! She's on us!

1095
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.789
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1096
02:02:07.690 --> 02:02:09.233
Make fast!

1097
02:02:10.443 --> 02:02:12.987
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1098
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:15.823
Come on, girl!

1099
02:02:21.871 --> 02:02:24.290
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1100
02:02:24.331 --> 02:02:28.085
We're the faster? Against the wind,
the Dutchman beats us that's what she takes her break.

1101
02:02:28.252 --> 02:02:30.546
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1102
02:02:30.588 --> 02:02:32.548
Aye.

1103
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:36.093
We're out of range!

1104
02:02:36.218 --> 02:02:40.806
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1105
02:02:40.931 --> 02:02:43.351
We're giving up, sir?

1106
02:02:53.402 --> 02:02:55.696
They're giving up!

1107
02:03:01.869 --> 02:03:03.913
My father is on that ship.

1108
02:03:03.996 --> 02:03:06.540
If we can outrun them we can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1109
02:03:06.624 --> 02:03:13.506
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1110
02:03:23.599 --> 02:03:26.394
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1111
02:03:27.812 --> 02:03:30.773
We must have hit a reef!

1112
02:03:32.858 --> 02:03:36.904
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1113
02:03:36.987 --> 02:03:39.990
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1114
02:03:40.366 --> 02:03:42.660
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1115
02:03:42.702 --> 02:03:47.123
It'll attack the starboard, I've seen it before. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1116
02:04:20.698 --> 02:04:23.200
Easy, boys!

1117
02:04:26.662 --> 02:04:27.705
Will?

1118
02:04:28.205 --> 02:04:30.416
Steady! Steady.

1119
02:04:32.293 --> 02:04:35.838
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1120
02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.799
I think we've held fire long enough.

1121
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:42.428
- Will!
- Fire!

1122
02:05:02.573 --> 02:05:06.160
- It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1123
02:05:14.251 --> 02:05:18.923
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1124
02:05:21.258 --> 02:05:25.721
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1125
02:05:39.902 --> 02:05:44.031
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

1126
02:05:45.074 --> 02:05:47.159
Hurry up!

1127
02:05:47.243 --> 02:05:50.830
- There's only half of kegs of powder!
- Then load the rum.

1128
02:05:59.630 --> 02:06:02.508
Aye, the rum too!

1129
02:06:30.786 --> 02:06:32.788
Step to!

1130
02:06:36.459 --> 02:06:38.961
You coward.

1131
02:06:43.799 --> 02:06:45.801
Not good.

1132
02:06:53.768 --> 02:06:56.520
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1133
02:06:56.562 --> 02:07:00.900
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1134
02:07:43.984 --> 02:07:47.279
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1135
02:07:47.279 --> 02:07:50.032
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1136
02:07:55.413 --> 02:07:58.374
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1137
02:08:15.182 --> 02:08:17.226
Here! Come on!

1138
02:08:17.977 --> 02:08:20.646
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1139
02:08:20.688 --> 02:08:22.773
Come on!

1140
02:08:47.673 --> 02:08:50.885
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1141
02:10:18.222 --> 02:10:20.182
Did we kill it?

1142
02:10:20.266 --> 02:10:23.894
No. We just made it angry.

1143
02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:27.231
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1144
02:10:29.150 --> 02:10:31.777
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1145
02:10:34.155 --> 02:10:36.991
Jack. The Pearl.

1146
02:10:38.284 --> 02:10:40.619
She's only a ship, mate.

1147
02:10:40.703 --> 02:10:43.330
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1148
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:46.459
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1149
02:10:46.459 --> 02:10:51.088
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

1150
02:10:53.090 --> 02:10:54.884
Abandon ship.

1151
02:10:55.009 --> 02:10:57.345
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1152
02:11:14.028 --> 02:11:16.238
Thank you, Jack.

1153
02:11:18.324 --> 02:11:21.160
We're not free yet, love.

1154
02:11:21.243 --> 02:11:23.371
You came back.

1155
02:11:25.998 --> 02:11:28.542
I always knew you were a good man.

1156
02:11:41.597 --> 02:11:44.392
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1157
02:11:44.475 --> 02:11:46.894
Come on, Will. Step to!

1158
02:12:06.122 --> 02:12:08.541
It's after you, not the ship.

1159
02:12:08.624 --> 02:12:11.585
It's not us.

1160
02:12:11.627 --> 02:12:14.422
This is the only way, don't you see?

1161
02:12:17.633 --> 02:12:19.802
I'm not sorry.

1162
02:12:25.433 --> 02:12:27.435
Pirate.

1163
02:12:46.787 --> 02:12:48.998
Where's Jack?

1164
02:12:52.626 --> 02:12:56.589
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1165
02:13:05.222 --> 02:13:07.099
Go!

1166
02:13:19.862 --> 02:13:22.198
Bugger. Bugger, bugger.

1167
02:13:51.477 --> 02:13:53.646
Come on!

1168
02:13:57.942 --> 02:14:00.695
Just got it. Come on.

1169
02:14:29.765 --> 02:14:32.226
Not so bad.

1170
02:14:43.529 --> 02:14:45.364
Hello, beastie.

1171
02:15:34.163 --> 02:15:38.334
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1172
02:15:39.668 --> 02:15:41.962
The captain goes down with his ship.

1173
02:15:41.962 --> 02:15:46.008
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1174
02:15:51.389 --> 02:15:53.891
Open the chest.

1175
02:15:55.101 --> 02:15:57.561
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1176
02:16:13.119 --> 02:16:19.291
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1177
02:16:25.047 --> 02:16:27.675
The last of our ships is returned.

1178
02:16:27.842 --> 02:16:30.219
Is there any news on the chest?

1179
02:16:30.261 --> 02:16:36.058
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1180
02:16:36.058 --> 02:16:38.185
He had these.

1181
02:16:45.276 --> 02:16:48.404
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1182
02:16:55.911 --> 02:16:59.999
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1183
02:17:00.041 --> 02:17:02.626
Do you have the compass?

1184
02:17:02.752 --> 02:17:04.587
Better.

1185
02:17:11.886 --> 02:17:14.388
The heart of Davy Jones.

1186
02:18:09.819 --> 02:18:12.279
Against the cold

1187
02:18:12.405 --> 02:18:14.740
and the sorrow.

1188
02:18:24.959 --> 02:18:27.461
It's a shame.

1189
02:18:27.545 --> 02:18:30.047
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

1190
02:18:30.089 --> 02:18:35.511
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1191
02:18:35.511 --> 02:18:38.222
Doesn't matter now.

1192
02:18:38.472 --> 02:18:41.017
The Pearl is gone,

1193
02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:43.060
along with its captain.

1194
02:18:43.144 --> 02:18:45.354
Aye.

1195
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:49.358
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1196
02:18:49.442 --> 02:18:52.570
He fooled us all right till the end,

1197
02:18:52.570 --> 02:18:56.449
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1198
02:18:59.326 --> 02:19:01.078
To Jack Sparrow.

1199
02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:06.167
- Never another like Captain Jack.
- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1200
02:19:06.667 --> 02:19:08.794
He was a good man.

1201
02:19:29.523 --> 02:19:33.527
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1202
02:19:34.945 --> 02:19:38.699
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1203
02:19:39.992 --> 02:19:42.328
What would you...

1204
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:49.627
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1205
02:19:50.753 --> 02:19:54.715
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1206
02:19:54.757 --> 02:19:59.887
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

1207
02:20:06.060 --> 02:20:07.311
Aye.

1208
02:20:08.354 --> 02:20:09.647
Aye.

1209
02:20:10.398 --> 02:20:11.524
Aye.

1210
02:20:12.942 --> 02:20:13.984
Aye.

1211
02:20:16.862 --> 02:20:18.948
Yes.

1212
02:20:21.283 --> 02:20:22.493
Aye.

1213
02:20:22.576 --> 02:20:24.537
All right.

1214
02:20:25.579 --> 02:20:32.670
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end,

1215
02:20:33.754 --> 02:20:40.011
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

1216
02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:59.113
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
