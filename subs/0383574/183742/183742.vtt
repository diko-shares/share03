<font color=#00ff00>DOWNFALL</font>

2
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,229
I feel as if I should be angry with that child,...

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,919
that naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,280
for not recognising the nature of that monster.

5
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,039
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,209
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

7
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,459
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said in Berlin:

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,660
"No I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters."

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,829
But I didn't do that. I was too curious.

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,470
I also didn't realise...

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,720
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,490
But nevertheless, I find it hard to forgive myself.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,330
- It's confirmed.
- They can pass.

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,090
<font color=#00ff00>November 1942 "Wolfsschanze" headquarters
of the Führer, Rastenburg East-Prussia</font>

16
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,820
Sit down, ladies.

17
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,090
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

18
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,360
Can you tell us... How are we
supposed to address the Führer?

19
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,339
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

20
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,129
And the Nazi salute?

21
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,729
That won't be necessary...

22
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,859
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier but for a secretary.

23
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,580
Act as normal and calm as you can.

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,700
I'll see if he has time for you.

25
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,990
Mein Führer, the ladies from Berlin are here.

26
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,070
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

27
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Sometimes during a war
one is not in control of time.

28
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,329
- Can I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz.

29
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,450
- Where are you from?
- From Fulda.

30
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,619
- And what is your name?
- Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,269
No need for that. Where are you from?

32
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,870
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

33
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,160
Hannah Potrovsky. Born and raised in Berlin.
In Pankow, to be precise.

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,800
Hedwig Brandt, from Crailsheim Schwaben.

35
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,010
- And you are?
- Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

36
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,700
A lady from Munich.

37
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,630
Shall we start then, Fräulein Humps?

38
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,510
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

39
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,380
She's much smarter than most people.

40
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,789
First, sit down please.

41
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,859
Don't be nervous.

42
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,520
I make many mistakes during dictation.
You won't make nearly as many.

43
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,939
You're very young.

44
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,680
- How old are you?
- 22, mein Führer.

45
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,540
My German fellow-countrymen and women...

46
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,809
...fellow party members.

47
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,329
It is I think rather special...

48
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:30,110
that after 20 years of service a man
still stands in front of his supporters...

49
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,020
...and that in all those 20 years his
program never needed to be modified.

50
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,800
I suggest we try it again.

51
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,170
I did it. He hired me.

52
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,559
<font color=#00ff00>Berlin - 20 April 1945 Hitler's 56th birthday
two and a half years later</font>

53
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,130
Take cover.

54
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,420
Hurry. Continue. Get that off the street.

55
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
Take cover.

56
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,019
That's artillery fire.

57
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,709
Don't be silly. Where would it be coming from?

58
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,140
You're right. These are no planes, this is artillery.

59
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,080
It's the Russians. What a birthday present.

60
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,839
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

61
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,469
Happy Birthday, mein Führer.

62
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,580
The city centre of Berlin is under fire.

63
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,279
Grenades have hit near the
Brandenburger Tor and the Reichstag.

64
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,400
- Where did they come from?
- We don't know yet.

65
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,059
- I have Koller on the line.
- Give me Koller.

66
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,750
Koller do you know Berlin is under artillery fire?

67
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,399
- No.
- Can't you hear the shooting?

68
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,050
- No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
- Berlin is chaotic.

69
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,680
Apparently the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

70
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,359
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

71
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,449
It's not long-range artillery.

72
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,669
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're...

73
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,359
...10 to 12 cm calibres. The Russians
have positions near Marzahn.

74
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,570
That's only 12 kilometres from the
centre. Are the Russians that close?

75
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,750
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

76
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,890
This is unheard-of.

77
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,050
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

78
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,700
Nobody told me anything. I had to ask.

79
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,350
Maybe it's long-range artillery after all.

80
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,010
- That railway bridge over the Oder...
- Nonsense.

81
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,870
That Himmler, such a pompous buffoon.

82
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,130
Party bosses everywhere. They make me so sick.

83
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,830
The Führer starts 'Clausewitz' today.

84
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,509
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

85
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,159
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

86
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,899
We have to talk him out of it. Talk to Hewel.

87
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,960
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

88
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,609
Hewel tried everything. It's useless.

89
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,729
Talk to your sister-in-law then.

90
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,459
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

91
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,699
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

92
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,749
You're still young. You'll be a father soon.

93
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,470
- Do you want to die here?
- Absolutely not.

94
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,160
Gentlemen, the Führer.

95
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,660
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

96
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,450
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

97
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,009
'Clausewitz' has started.

98
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,180
All the ministries and
departments are leaving Berlin.

99
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,900
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

100
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,580
- Don't ask me, professor.
- This is insane.

101
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
Professor.

102
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,529
I won't allow the evacuation of my office.

103
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,209
- Is that so?
- Food supply would collapse.

104
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,339
A good soldier can always find food.

105
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,540
And when there's fighting all over the city
where does he get it? The population.

106
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,050
- It's irresponsible.
- It's an order from the Führer.

107
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,939
As department head I report
to the SS and to Himmler.

108
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,419
But as a doctor I'm part of the Wehrmacht,
and they're not leaving yet.

109
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,050
Keep that in mind.

110
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,380
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

111
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,510
We're leaving.

112
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,670
Everything for Germany. Heil, mein Führer.

113
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,840
Führer, I... Heil, mein Führer.

114
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,879
They're in such a hurry to get away from here.

115
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,489
The brown nosing is the worst.

116
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,650
They say 'Sieg Heil'. But they think
'Lick my... you know what.'

117
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,420
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

118
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,520
Too late?

119
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,170
Hewel, come here for a moment.

120
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,489
I'm sure you agree we
should contact the Allies...

121
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,689
- ...and start conducting politics.
- Certainly. We need politics.

122
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,359
Politics? I don't do politics anymore.

123
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm fed up with it.

124
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,029
When I'm dead, you'll have
plenty of time for politics.

125
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,099
It's good dear Himmler. My loyal Heinrich.

126
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,060
It's good. Just go.

127
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,970
He has no strength left.

128
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,650
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

129
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,520
Seriously though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

130
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,539
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

131
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,629
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

132
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,269
Why do you think they'll negotiate with you?

133
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,920
The Nazi state and my SS are
needed to maintain order.

134
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,040
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

135
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,240
- The first contact has been made.
- Careful, that's high treason.

136
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,849
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

137
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,570
Should I give Eisenhower the
Nazi salute or shake his hand?

138
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,040
Look at that.

139
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,439
The best guests always arrive late.

140
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,170
Leaving already gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

141
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,869
- The scorched-earth order...
- I really have to go now.

142
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,520
Come and see me one day in Hohenlychen.

143
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm going north to help with
the battle of Berlin there.

144
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,959
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

145
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,690
It's easier to clean up debris than
to demolish everything ourselves.

146
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,910
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

147
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,210
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

148
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,910
You're a true genius, Speer.

149
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,209
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

150
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,430
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

151
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,640
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

152
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,779
...that will survive thousands of years.

153
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,779
We see before us the ancient
cities the Acropolis...

154
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:42,610
We see the medieval cities... the cathedrals
and we know that the people need that.

155
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,340
Indeed, Speer.

156
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,040
That was my vision...

157
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,210
...and it still is.

158
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,640
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans you must leave Berlin.

159
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,380
Eva, you say something.

160
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,039
He's the Führer. He knows what's best.

161
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,249
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

162
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,859
I can't do that my child.

163
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,079
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

164
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,120
I have to solve the problem
here in Berlin or perish.

165
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,230
Speer...

166
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,410
...what do you think?

167
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,100
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

168
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,500
Reload.

169
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,569
Go away. Leave me alone.

170
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,339
How old are you? Twelve? And you? Fourteen?

171
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,989
Why are you here? To play at war? Go home.

172
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,159
- Who are you? What do you want?
- I want my son. Alive.

173
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,810
You should be proud. He destroyed two tanks.

174
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,960
The Führer will decorate him for it today.

175
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,120
You're still young. At which front did you fight?

176
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
I haven't had the honour yet.

177
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,440
Count yourself lucky. Send the children home.

178
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,069
We'll defend this position to the last man.

179
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,920
Which position? This is not a position it's a trap.

180
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,899
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

181
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,780
- We'll shoot back.
- What with?

182
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,110
With the anti-aircraft guns.

183
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,289
The Russians will arrive with several
armies tanks and heavy artillery.

184
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,979
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

185
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,609
We promised the Führer.

186
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't you understand? The war is lost.

187
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,330
Coward.

188
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,110
Go away. Right now.

189
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,850
If you're still here when the
Russians arrive, you'll all be dead.

190
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,240
The 9th army had to retreat or
they would have been decimated...

191
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,979
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

192
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,110
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

193
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,329
We'll push back the Soviet
armies in the north and east...

194
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,550
...with a ruthless mighty attack.

195
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,630
Using which units?

196
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,370
Steiner will attack from the
north and join the 9th army.

197
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,069
The 9th army is unable to move.

198
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,780
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

199
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,329
Wenck's 12th army must support them.

200
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:30,069
- The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
- Then it must turn around.

201
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,760
- Then the western front would be open.
- Do you doubt my orders?

202
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,940
I think I've been clear enough.

203
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,809
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

204
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,030
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

205
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,460
- Mohnke, you're here.
- Mein Führer.

206
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,719
Today 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

207
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,939
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

208
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,639
We'll fight until the last man in Berlin.

209
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,330
There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.

210
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,159
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

211
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,330
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

212
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,069
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

213
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,799
...and the thousands of wounded and elderly?

214
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,370
In a war such as this one, there are no civilians.

215
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,509
The Führer has lost all sense of reality.

216
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,159
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

217
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,899
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

218
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,069
- But why don't you tell him that?
- He doesn't listen to reason.

219
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,770
- Something has to happen.
- Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

220
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,509
We're soldiers. We took an oath.

221
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,430
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

222
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,609
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

223
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,080
I beg your pardon?

224
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,680
- Where were you?
- None of your business.

225
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,790
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

226
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,190
I'm proud of you.

227
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,010
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

228
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,230
- His name is Peter Kranz.
- So, you're Peter.

229
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,970
I wish my generals were as brave as you.

230
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,920
Very good.

231
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,049
You've made history.

232
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,769
And when Germania will
rise from these ruins...

233
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,380
...you will be the heroes.

234
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,030
Heil to you.

235
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,940
I don't know about you, but I prefer air raids.

236
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,679
- What will happen to us?
- I could go if I wanted to.

237
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,499
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go can we?

238
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,680
I can't go either.

239
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,009
I wouldn't know where to go.

240
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,810
My parents and all my friends warned me.

241
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,339
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

242
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,959
What should I say: "Hello I made a mistake"?

243
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,880
"When things went wrong I admitted my mistake."

244
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,870
Life will go on.

245
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,140
- What do you think, Herr Oberst?
- We have to go.

246
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,089
- Go where?
- I don't know.

247
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,590
Wherever they need us.

248
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,560
Let's go upstairs. We'll party.

249
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,130
Come on.

250
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,800
Come, children.

251
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,700
We should have fun today.

252
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,800
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

253
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,450
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

254
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,650
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

255
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:51,459
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

256
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,110
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

257
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,309
If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost, too?

258
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:06,559
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant right now.

259
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,199
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

260
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,329
Our people turned out weak...

261
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:17,489
...and according to the laws
of nature, they should die out.

262
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,830
They're your people. You're their Führer.

263
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,259
What remains after this battle...

264
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,960
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

265
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,109
Come along. You have to dance.

266
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,760
- Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
- I'd love to.

267
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,500
- May I?
- Go ahead.

268
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,580
What's wrong?

269
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,910
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

270
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Or else come with me.

271
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,130
You'll die.

272
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,469
Can somebody play some
music? I want to dance.

273
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,030
Dance.

274
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,340
- Do you have a request?
- As long as it swings.

275
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,310
Traudl.

276
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,389
It's all so unreal.

277
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,729
It's like a dream you can't get out of.

278
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,120
It keeps on going.

279
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,900
Gerda, I don't feel well.

280
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,090
Traudl, come.

281
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,830
I did not move...

282
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,540
I did not move my command post.

283
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,050
To the west? How so?

284
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,710
- I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
- General.

285
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,649
And general?

286
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,310
- I'll be executed.
- What? Why?

287
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,840
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

288
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,000
- Be sensible, general.
- Come along.

289
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,369
- Schenck.
- Mohnke.

290
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,970
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

291
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,659
- I need help.
- That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

292
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,270
My assistant and I are the only ones here.

293
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,059
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, an internist.

294
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,949
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

295
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,069
...you can find to me.

296
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,220
- I'll do my best.
- Thanks. Hurry.

297
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,900
I need to talk to the Führer.

298
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,380
- What about?
- I'm going to be executed.

299
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,370
Wait here.

300
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,970
Your weapon, please.

301
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,310
Not here.

302
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,530
Guard post 2. Understood.

303
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,170
General...

304
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,340
Not you.

305
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,990
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

306
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,079
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

307
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,969
Officers who don't obey must be executed.

308
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,930
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

309
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,139
My command post is a kilometre
away from the front line.

310
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,009
Continue.

311
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,910
Do you see this? I don't want
you to use that tone with me.

312
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,709
And now do whatever you feel you must.

313
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,890
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

314
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,279
- You can't pass, Oberst.
- Orders from brigade leader Mohnke:

315
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,519
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

316
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,649
There's nobody left. They all took off.

317
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,169
- And the wounded?
- How should I know?

318
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,449
I'm going to have a look. You stay here.

319
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,140
Be very careful. There
are lots of Russians here.

320
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,650
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Beyond is Russkie land.

321
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,529
May I?

322
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,670
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

323
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,840
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

324
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,489
- Drink.
- Führer's orders.

325
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,110
You made a big impression on the Führer.

326
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,719
But you don't think Steiner will attack, do you?

327
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,839
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

328
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,970
...but you probably know that better than I do.

329
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,130
If Steiner doesn't attack, Berlin is lost.

330
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,889
The Führer was impressed with your report.

331
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,580
He puts you in command
of the defence of Berlin.

332
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,300
I'd have preferred it if he executed me.

333
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,310
Let them get closer.

334
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,769
Tank alert.

335
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:29,170
Take it easy. Wait kid. They're still too far.

336
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,569
- Is it German artillery that I hear?
- I'm afraid not.

337
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,180
But hasn't Steiner's attack started?

338
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,429
You have to go as fast as
you can. Time is running out.

339
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,030
But the Führer has the situation under control.

340
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,130
Steiner will make all the difference.

341
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,799
He says it will change military history.

342
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,969
Everybody but the Führer
knows that's a fantasy.

343
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:50,699
- I even wonder if he believes it himself.
- Why would he be playing games?

344
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,780
What does he have to lose?

345
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,680
I don't believe a word of it.

346
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,029
The enemy made a breakthrough.

347
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,200
They took Zossen and are
advancing towards Stahnsdorf.

348
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,370
They're at the northern city border
between Frohnau and Pankow.

349
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,009
In the east they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

350
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,760
If Steiner attacks, everything will be alright.

351
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,980
Mein Führer...

352
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,110
Steiner...

353
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,279
Steiner didn't have enough force.

354
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,410
The attack didn't take place.

355
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,450
The following stay here:
Keitel Jodl Krebs and Burgdorf.

356
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:14,299
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

357
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,990
How dare you ignore my orders?

358
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,690
Is this what it came to?

359
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:30,469
The military, everybody
lied to me. Even the SS.

360
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:36,200
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

361
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,809
I don't allow that...

362
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:44,029
- Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
- Führer, this is outrageous.

363
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,199
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

364
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,729
No sense of honour.

365
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:56,540
You call yourself general, because
you spent years at the academy...

366
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,669
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

367
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:04,369
For years the military obstructed me.

368
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:09,060
All you ever did is thwart me.

369
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,950
I should have had...

370
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,170
...all the high officers executed. Like Stalin did.

371
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,989
I never went to the academy.

372
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:32,290
But I conquered all of Europe on my own.

373
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,649
Traitors.

374
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,860
I've been betrayed and
deceived from the start.

375
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:49,080
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

376
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,340
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

377
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,390
They will drown in their own blood.

378
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,560
Calm, Gerda.

379
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,770
All my orders have been ignored.

380
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,510
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

381
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,370
It's over.

382
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,440
The war is lost.

383
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,110
But if you think this means I'll leave Berlin...

384
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,810
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

385
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,740
Do what you want.

386
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:16,239
The Führer wasn't serious
about killing himself, was he?

387
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,360
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

388
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,210
Get changed. In one hour
a plane will take you south.

389
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,789
Everything is lost.

390
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,900
Completely lost.

391
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:41,200
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

392
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,610
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

393
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,210
Now what?

394
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,820
Time to end this charade.

395
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,029
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

396
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:34,459
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

397
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,919
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

398
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,569
Nobody can replace him. He's the Führer.

399
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,170
The Führer's confused. He'll recover.

400
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,820
Great. And then what?

401
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,560
No capitulation. That was never his intention.

402
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,209
- We owe it to him.
- Hollow phrases.

403
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,520
We have to act now. Or it will be too late.

404
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:04,470
- You're only looking after yourself.
- Mind your words.

405
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,260
Damn.

406
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,530
We'll never get out of here alive. It's all over.

407
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,699
We've got to wait.

408
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,869
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

409
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,570
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

410
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,219
Why did you say you wanted to stay with him?

411
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,390
I don't know. Honestly.

412
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,610
It stopped. Let's go for a walk.

413
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,499
Traudl.

414
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,080
Look here.

415
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,120
I'm lighting another one.

416
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,670
Let's go down again.

417
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,880
- Where do they come from?
- Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

418
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,010
They have to get out of the field of fire.

419
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,840
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

420
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,660
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

421
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,270
I'll take the responsibility.

422
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,390
- I think this is wrong.
- Great.

423
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,019
Stop. Lights out.

424
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,549
Stop. Stay where you are.

425
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,000
- Stay where you are.
- Alright, Germans.

426
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,689
- Help. They want to kill us.
- What is all this?

427
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,590
- A Greifkommando.
- You're kidding.

428
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,820
Stop it. Let those men go.

429
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,879
What's this? You have no authority here.

430
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,090
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

431
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,470
They're old men. Civilians. You can't do this.

432
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,930
Who's going to stop me? You maybe?

433
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,100
Stop it. That's enough.

434
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,610
Dismissed.

435
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,500
This man's a doctor.

436
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,400
- Can you operate?
- Not really.

437
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:46,359
Don't let the children take too many toys.

438
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,010
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

439
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,669
- Herr Minister...
- Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

440
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:58,349
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

441
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,439
Brigade leader what can I do for you?

442
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,079
Your Volkssturm is an easy
prey for the Russians.

443
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,199
They have neither combat
experience nor good weapons.

444
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,709
Their unconditional belief in the
final victory makes up for that.

445
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,110
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

446
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,299
Their deaths will be pointless.

447
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,420
I don't pity them.

448
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,980
I repeat: I don't pity them.

449
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,110
The people called this upon themselves.

450
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,000
This may come as a surprise
to you. Don't fool yourself.

451
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:38,639
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

452
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,600
And now they're paying for it.

453
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,239
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

454
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,039
Don't be stupid. This is about life and death.

455
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,740
How can you say that? Where are you?

456
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,389
I decided not to die in Berlin.

457
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,590
- Does my sister know where you are?
- Think about it. I'll call you back.

458
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,280
Children, your room is to the right.

459
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,920
Wait for me.

460
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,730
- Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Good to see you, Frau Junge.

461
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,599
Line up, children.

462
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,200
Helga, come. Line up.

463
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,930
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

464
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,180
Do you remember the song?

465
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:42,430
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

466
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:50,220
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

467
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,859
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

468
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,499
If I have to die, at least without any pain.

469
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,589
That's definitely painless.

470
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:04,789
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

471
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,870
A matter of seconds.

472
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,080
- Can I have one too?
- Me too.

473
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,970
Himmler provided me well.

474
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,370
Thank you.

475
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,600
I would have liked to give you a nicer present.

476
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,650
Berlin 23 April 1945.

477
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:08,499
Dear sister. I'm sorry to write you this.

478
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,699
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

479
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,349
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

480
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,509
But I'm sure you'll see him again.

481
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:27,239
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

482
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,400
The Führer lost all hope of a good outcome.

483
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,610
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

484
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:42,330
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

485
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,499
I stayed with daddy against his will.

486
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,139
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

487
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,269
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

488
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,429
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

489
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:03,159
...and with it everything that made
life beautiful and worthwhile.

490
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,340
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

491
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,489
That's why I brought the children too.

492
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,089
They're too good for the life that awaits them.

493
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:19,290
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

494
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,269
I'll wear my bracelet with the
green stone until the very end.

495
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:37,000
After that, I want you to always wear it.

496
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,210
Unfortunately, my diamond
watch is with the watchmaker.

497
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,410
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

498
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,320
I want you to get it.

499
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,239
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

500
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,170
A birthday present from the Führer.

501
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,290
I owe some money to the Heise company.

502
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,430
There may be more debts but
no more than 1,500 Reichsmarks.

503
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:16,860
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

504
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:25,409
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

505
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:31,470
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

506
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,910
I can't think of anything else. That's it for today.

507
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,489
Dear sister, I wish you lots of happiness.

508
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,659
And remember, you will see Hermann again.

509
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,839
The warmest regards and a kiss from...

510
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,920
...your sister.

511
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,730
Inge.

512
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:40,569
Listen, Keitel. I want you to leave this evening.

513
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,749
Go to Dönitz and help him with the organisation.

514
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:48,900
Things have to be started up again.

515
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,449
I don't understand you.

516
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,709
We have no more oil fields. That's catastrophic.

517
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,269
It makes any serious operation impossible.

518
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:08,000
When everything has been solved,
here we must get the oil fields back.

519
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:17,100
- Any questions?
- No, mein Führer.

520
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:20,230
Good. Have a good trip.

521
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:52,969
Mein Führer, since you have
decided to stay here in Berlin...

522
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:57,149
...do you agree that I take charge...

523
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,499
...with complete freedom of action?

524
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,409
If I receive no reply by 22:00...

525
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,960
...I'll assume you have been incapacitated.

526
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,540
I will then act on behalf of the
country and the motherland.

527
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,790
That's high treason. And betrayal of you.

528
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,920
Göring's concerns are not entirely unjustified.

529
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:25,229
If our communication system fails
we'll be cut off from the outside world.

530
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,839
We won't be able to issue orders anymore.

531
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:35,130
I think Göring wants to seize the power.
I never trusted his clique on the Obersalzberg.

532
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,739
This looks like a coup.

533
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,409
The loser, the sponger.

534
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,540
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

535
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:50,380
How dare he say I'm incapacitated?

536
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:54,559
- Hello.
- How did you get into Berlin?

537
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,690
It wasn't easy, but I must speak to the Führer.

538
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,419
If I were you, I'd wait a bit.

539
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,970
The Luftwaffe. What did he turn that into?

540
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,629
For that alone he should be executed.

541
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:14,380
This morphine addict corrupted the country.

542
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,980
And now this.

543
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,620
He's betraying me.

544
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,789
Me of all people.

545
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:35,720
I want Göring stripped
of his power right away.

546
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,359
And in case I don't survive the war...

547
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,010
...he must be executed immediately.

548
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,770
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

549
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,499
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

550
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,669
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind can we?

551
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:05,910
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

552
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:10,820
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

553
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,570
But the children...

554
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,300
I have always believed...

555
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,980
...that there was a way out.

556
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,830
Come in.

557
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,000
Albert. Hello.

558
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,029
You have a fever.

559
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,170
Albert I can't stand it anymore.

560
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,859
Why don't you leave with the children, Magda?

561
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,979
Leave? And go where?

562
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:16,189
I can arrange for you to be taken
to Schwanenwerder by barge.

563
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:20,049
You can hide until everything's over.

564
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,959
It won't be long now anyway.

565
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,160
I thought about it.

566
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,830
My children cannot grow up in a
world without National Socialism.

567
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:40,130
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

568
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,990
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

569
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:08,010
I can't believe you really want that.

570
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,190
Go now.

571
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,130
Come in.

572
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,879
I knew you'd come.

573
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,520
You wouldn't desert the Führer.

574
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:05,079
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

575
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,400
Of course, you must go. Sit down.

576
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:16,679
I took some furniture you designed.
I couldn't leave it behind.

577
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,960
Please, you must not have eaten all day.

578
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,970
That's true.

579
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:33,859
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

580
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,460
Did he ever doubt that?

581
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,669
Lately, he often thought
you were against him, too.

582
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,830
I always said you'd come and here you are.

583
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,159
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

584
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,760
I also think it's best.

585
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,970
And you know...

586
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:05,090
...it may sound strange...

587
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:12,380
...but I'm really happy here. And I'm not afraid.

588
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,799
You came.

589
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,900
- Mein Führer, I...
- It's good.

590
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,030
Let's sit down.

591
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:12,210
I had great plans for the Germans and the world.

592
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:18,990
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

593
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:29,430
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

594
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:34,000
Too late.

595
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:45,480
I can only be proud for openly fighting the Jews...

596
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:51,220
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

597
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,579
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

598
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:10,540
...and then eternal peace.

599
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,329
But please, spare the people, mein Führer.

600
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:23,069
If my people cannot endure this ordeal...

601
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,719
...I won't shed a tear.

602
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,329
They get what they deserve.

603
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:35,090
They called this fate upon themselves.

604
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,900
For months...

605
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,560
...I have to tell you this...

606
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,780
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

607
01:11:53,350 --> 01:12:00,150
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

608
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,430
I had to tell you.

609
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,920
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

610
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,300
So, you're leaving.

611
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,619
Good.

612
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,700
Goodbye.

613
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,410
I wish you all the best.

614
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:21,100
Eat well, gentlemen.

615
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,490
Peter.

616
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,170
It's alright, son.

617
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,580
He has a fever.

618
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,780
Yes, but he's alive.

619
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:20,359
Loyalty and courage still exist in this world.

620
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,510
Ritter von Greim and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...

621
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:31,820
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

622
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,410
Sit down.

623
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,609
We came under heavy fire but
still arrived in Gatow.

624
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:41,740
From there we couldn't continue.

625
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:46,960
We flew in a Fieseler Storch
over the Russian lines...

626
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,620
...and landed on the East-West axis, close to here.

627
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,760
Before landing, the Soviets had a go at us.

628
01:15:54,620 --> 01:16:00,150
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

629
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,810
I hereby promote you to General-Feldmarschall.

630
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,539
A big responsibility rests on your shoulders.

631
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:11,200
You have to rebuild the Luftwaffe from scratch.

632
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:14,340
Many mistakes have been made. Be ruthless.

633
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:19,050
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

634
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:26,910
This so-called humanity is religious drivel.

635
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,810
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

636
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,510
...is a betrayal of nature.

637
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:41,789
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

638
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:47,800
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

639
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,310
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

640
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:59,520
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

641
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,510
Apes for instance...

642
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:08,720
...kill all the odd ones.

643
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:15,000
And what applies to apes
must definitely apply to humans.

644
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,879
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

645
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:29,659
...to the allied powers.

646
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,750
Via Count Bernadotte.

647
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,460
A message from the English radio.

648
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:46,110
Himmler. Himmler, of all people.

649
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:54,490
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

650
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:01,940
Göring, he was corrupt. Always has been.

651
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:08,559
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

652
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:15,329
But Himmler? Has he gone insane?

653
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:20,010
He must have told them I'm sick.

654
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,620
Maybe even dead.

655
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:33,550
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

656
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:39,799
- And get Fegelein.
- We don't know where he is.

657
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,839
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

658
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,650
- We haven't seen him for days.
- I want a report, immediately.

659
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,330
Please stay here, Doctor.

660
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,579
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

661
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:08,949
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

662
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:13,630
We've decided to die with you.

663
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,840
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

664
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,529
But Himmler must die. He committed treason.

665
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:28,729
He's no longer privvy to my plans.

666
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,289
Mein Führer?

667
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:34,759
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

668
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,619
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

669
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:44,949
...to invade the Reich and
they think they've won.

670
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,989
But mark my words: they
have another thing coming.

671
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:52,979
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

672
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,359
We'll surround the enemy and crush them.

673
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,589
From Prague three armies will attack
the Russians simultaneously from the back.

674
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:08,810
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

675
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:17,660
I made sure you'll soon have a 1000 of
the most modern jets at your disposal.

676
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,349
With those you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

677
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:27,560
I kneel to your genius at the
altar of the motherland.

678
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,000
Heil, mein Führer.

679
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:50,450
You also request to leave Berlin?

680
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:56,179
Mein Führer, as you know
all medical departments...

681
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:00,220
...that fall under the SS and
Himmler have left Berlin.

682
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:05,229
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

683
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:10,590
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS
I have no more work here.

684
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:15,270
Your request to leave Berlin is unacceptable.

685
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:18,920
My family...

686
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:26,080
- If the Russians... I must leave.
- You did nothing wrong.

687
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,929
Future generations will thank
you for you medical research.

688
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:34,530
I take all the responsibility.

689
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,180
We'll talk about it later.

690
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:01,889
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

691
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:05,010
What, you can't find Fegelein?

692
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:10,220
Keep searching. I need to
talk to him. Immediately.

693
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:15,419
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

694
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,499
Bring me Fegelein.

695
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,630
Fegelein. Fegelein.

696
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,240
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

697
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:42,549
- Ernst, is something wrong?
- No.

698
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,630
Thank you.

699
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,220
Brigitte is hungry too.

700
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,940
Ilse, you should eat something as well.

701
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,110
- Thank you.
- There you go.

702
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:03,350
Thank you.

703
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:01,010
- What is it?
- Gruppenführer, you're under arrest.

704
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,619
- What?
- You're suspected of desertion.

705
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,220
Get dressed. You'll come with us.

706
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,989
Search the room.

707
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:16,630
Let go of me. You can't give me orders.

708
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,839
You can't have Hermann executed can you?

709
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,959
There's no doubt. He wanted to flee.

710
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,120
What does it matter? Everything's over.

711
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:33,149
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

712
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:36,910
He collaborated with Himmler. He's a traitor.

713
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:45,240
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

714
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,450
He'll be court-martialled and executed.

715
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:53,570
What's the point of that?

716
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:57,220
It is my wish.

717
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,150
You're the Führer.

718
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:17,029
Speak.

719
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:19,950
The Russians are advancing more and more.

720
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,799
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

721
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,420
There is no ammunition coming in anymore.

722
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:33,689
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

723
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,129
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

724
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:41,500
West: Tiergarten about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

725
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,660
- How long can you hold out?
- At most two days.

726
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,110
- Including the government area?
- Yes.

727
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:55,350
As a soldier I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

728
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:01,619
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

729
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,790
That's what young people are for.

730
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,969
What you suggest is insane. Ridiculous.

731
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:13,099
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

732
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:18,319
Mein Führer, the orders have
been written. I give you my word...

733
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,539
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

734
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:28,239
Even if an advance is successful...

735
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:31,889
...I'll end up in another troublesome situation.

736
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:37,630
I'd have to stay in the open air or on a farm...

737
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,720
...and wait for the end.

738
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:46,849
Wenck is advancing with the
12th army. He can join the 9th...

739
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,550
...and give the Russians the final blow.

740
01:26:51,730 --> 01:26:56,430
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

741
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:05,300
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

742
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,950
2. When will they attack again?

743
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,740
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

744
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:22,520
You'll see, gentlemen. I'll be right.

745
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:25,660
Wenck will come.

746
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:34,230
Wenck will come.

747
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,659
I want to know if Wenck can do anything at all.

748
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:56,879
It's unlikely that Wenck's small amount of troops...

749
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,099
- What's unlikely about the offensive?
- Wenck can't do anything anymore.

750
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,799
Then why don't you tell the Führer that?
Has everybody gone mad?

751
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,449
Do you think the Führer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

752
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:14,629
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

753
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,240
Come along. I have to go.

754
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,960
Stop right there.

755
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,600
Heil Hitler.

756
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:33,499
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

757
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,610
Did you get some rest my child?

758
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,180
In shorthand.

759
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,600
My political will.

760
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,859
More than 30 years have passed...

761
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:02,549
...since I made my contribution as a volunteer...

762
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:07,249
...during the first World War.

763
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:12,989
During those 30 years
I learnt to think act and live...

764
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:16,640
...out of love and loyalty for my people.

765
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:24,220
- Excuse me. The shooting.
- Please sit down.

766
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:30,549
Centuries will pass...

767
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:34,709
...but from the ruins of our
cities and monuments...

768
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:40,439
...the hatred of the people...

769
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:44,079
...who did this to us will continue to flare up.

770
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:48,770
International Judaism and its allies.

771
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,030
What is it Herr Minister?

772
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,280
Imagine this.
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

773
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,400
He ordered it.

774
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:17,130
I've never ignored an order from the Führer.

775
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:31,540
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

776
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,340
Please, Frau Junge...

777
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,550
...I want to dictate my will to you.

778
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:47,250
I'm typing the Führer's will.

779
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,870
Good.

780
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,520
I understand. Some other time.

781
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:06,920
Mein Führer, according to the
racial law I'm obliged to ask you:

782
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:10,050
Mein Führer, are you of Aryan descent?

783
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:17,590
Can I see your identity card?

784
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:21,799
- You're talking to the Führer here.
- Alright then.

785
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,960
And you, Fräulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

786
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:29,919
Then there's nothing to stop us.

787
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,079
I'm asking you now: Do you,
mein Führer Adolf Hitler,...

788
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,810
...take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer "yes".

789
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:45,529
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

790
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:49,180
...as your husband? Answer "yes".

791
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,860
Then I declare you man and wife.

792
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,250
Two men here.

793
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,080
Everything will be alright.

794
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,600
- You must go to the Führer right away.
- Now?

795
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,440
- How long can we hold out?
- Twenty hours, no more.

796
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:14,729
The Russians are close. At the moment
we forced them to stop.

797
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:20,449
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

798
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:26,180
They'll succumb to the people from the east.

799
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,900
All the best. Thank you.

800
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:36,070
It wasn't just for Germany.

801
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,050
A message from Keitel.

802
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:04,989
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

803
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:09,150
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

804
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:13,640
3. The 9th army is completely surrounded.

805
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:38,990
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

806
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:42,650
I'll never surrender. Never.

807
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:49,950
I forbid you and the other
commanders to surrender.

808
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:07,689
Listen, Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

809
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:12,379
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

810
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:16,029
I don't want them to get me
dead or alive.

811
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:20,200
I want to be burnt and never to be found.

812
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,489
Günsche, I want you to promise me...

813
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:33,220
...that you will do all that it takes.

814
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:35,309
Mein Führer,...

815
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:40,000
...this is a terrible order, but I will execute it.

816
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:10,879
- Kempka.
- Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

817
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,040
Are you mad? Where should I find them?

818
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:16,950
From the parked vehicles.

819
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:20,900
- What's all that petrol for?
- I can't say on telephone.

820
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:41,110
Come please. The Führer wants to see us.

821
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,170
Should I tell the Führer you're indisposed?

822
01:37:52,690 --> 01:37:56,340
It's only my collapsed lung.

823
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:00,460
I'll die soon anyway.

824
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,040
Excuse me.

825
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,700
Over here, Herr Professor.

826
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,000
One moment, please.

827
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,100
Excuse me.

828
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:02,699
I'm sorry to interrupt your important work.

829
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:07,389
Mein Führer, keep faith in the final victory.

830
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:12,600
Lead us and we shall follow.

831
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,960
Come along.

832
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:27,310
Join the gang.

833
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:32,150
Come. Have a drink.

834
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:36,839
- Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
- Do sit down.

835
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:44,140
That's better. Yes, the situation is pretty shitty.

836
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:51,950
- Can we sit down?
- Please do, Fräulein...

837
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:56,650
- Frau...
- That's Frau Hitler.

838
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:00,810
It's alright.

839
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:05,500
A pity we can't go outside anymore.

840
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:09,149
Only if you want to die a heroic death.

841
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:15,410
- Fritz, control yourself a bit.
- Yes. Control.

842
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:18,010
Take cover.

843
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,129
- What are you doing here?
- I have to report to the Führer.

844
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,739
You can't right now. Sit down.

845
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:48,340
Sit. Drink.

846
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:54,079
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

847
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:58,770
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

848
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:05,500
Excuse me. I'm not used to drinking anymore.

849
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,150
You can use our toilet.

850
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:21,149
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

851
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:26,360
That's why it's good to also take the poison.

852
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:31,579
When you bite through the
capsule, pull the trigger.

853
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:34,180
Will I have enough time?

854
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,830
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

855
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,850
Tornow, you too.

856
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,450
Come, Blondi.

857
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:46,359
You know, Frau Junge, I've known
my husband for more than 15 years.

858
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,570
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

859
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,180
Even though he likes to talk.

860
01:43:57,090 --> 01:44:01,999
I longed for Berlin, but he's so different now.

861
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:06,169
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

862
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:09,290
I hate Blondi.

863
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:16,070
I sometimes kick her, and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

864
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:29,620
I think he doesn't want
anybody to really know him.

865
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:37,440
...he can be so caring in his private life.

866
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:43,700
And then he uses that rude language again.

867
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:47,130
When he's the Führer, you mean?

868
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:51,830
Come, let's smoke another one.

869
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:15,190
I'm sorry.

870
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:21,440
You have so many worries,
and here I am whining.

871
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:26,530
Frau Junge, I'm giving you this
coat as a goodbye present.

872
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:31,870
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

873
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:35,520
What a surprise. Thank you.

874
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,330
I just don't know where
and when I can wear it.

875
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:45,430
Please, try to get out of here.

876
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:48,560
Promise me.

877
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,830
Thank you. That was very good, Fräulein Manziarly.

878
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:48,110
The time has come. It's finished.

879
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:28,930
The Führer wants to say goodbye. Come with me.

880
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:04,050
You're the bravest mother of the Reich.

881
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:08,750
Führer, you made me the
happiest woman in Germany.

882
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:34,980
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

883
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:04,010
- Children, what are you doing here?
- We want to see aunt Eva and uncle Hitler.

884
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:08,190
- Have you eaten anything yet?
- Only breakfast.

885
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:13,400
Stay here, I'll get something
to eat. I'll be right back.

886
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:27,289
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

887
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:33,030
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

888
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,640
Herr Günsche, I want to speak to the Führer.

889
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:44,290
Please, I have to.

890
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,909
Frau Goebbels, the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

891
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:50,550
Please, Günsche, just for a moment.

892
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,640
Please.

893
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:02,720
Mein Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.

894
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,759
What is it?

895
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,930
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.

896
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:21,720
Don't leave us, Führer. What will become of us?

897
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:32,900
Tomorrow I'll be cursed by
millions, but that's how it is.

898
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,790
Get up. Come.

899
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,490
Come.

900
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:53,430
Aunt Traudl, I like it when it thunders.

901
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,609
- Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here.

902
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,220
- Can it?
- No.

903
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,290
Gotcha.

904
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,970
Reichsleiter, it's over.

905
01:52:56,330 --> 01:52:58,560
The Führer is dead.

906
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,810
There's daddy.

907
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:32,429
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

908
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:34,540
Erich, shut up.

909
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:47,060
Stand back.

910
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,589
Come on, continue.

911
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:03,770
Continue.

912
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:36,830
No don't.

913
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:40,200
Let grandpa go.

914
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:50,200
Order. Order. We must have order.

915
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:53,850
Order has to return.

916
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:12,360
This way. We know the way. You can trust us.

917
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:14,570
Hurry.

918
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:23,790
<i>"I was on the side of the Red Beasts."</i>

919
01:56:27,310 --> 01:56:29,910
<i>"I supported the Bolsheviks."</i>

920
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,970
Let's hope the Russians got our message.

921
01:56:38,980 --> 01:56:42,100
- We'll soon find out.
- Or not.

922
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:50,259
What news do you have, General?

923
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:55,990
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

924
01:56:58,610 --> 01:57:03,300
The new government authorised me...

925
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:08,519
...to start peace talks...

926
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:15,300
...between our countries that
both suffered severe losses.

927
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:21,039
General, if you were me, would
you make peace with you?

928
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:25,730
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

929
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:32,510
Given the situation, you have no other choice.

930
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:38,250
Surrender? Never. That's shameful.

931
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:41,379
Years ago, I conquered Berlin on the Reds...

932
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:46,060
...and I'll defend the city to my dying day.

933
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:49,709
In the short time I have as Chancellor...

934
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:54,389
...I'll never sign a surrender treaty.

935
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:58,039
- It's for the sake of the people.
- The Führer's orders are final.

936
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:02,199
This is crazy. We have to start negotiations.

937
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,840
I repeat gentlemen: I do not surrender.

938
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:09,489
- Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
- Zhukov?

939
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:12,609
- What's happening?
- We're surrendering.

940
01:58:12,610 --> 01:58:16,260
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

941
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:39,460
- How long does it work?
- Around four hours.

942
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:21,769
Children, the doctor has the
medication I told you about.

943
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:25,200
It's a bit bitter, but it will work.

944
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:28,320
A sip for everybody.

945
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,960
Who wants to go first?

946
01:59:34,050 --> 01:59:37,710
Heide you're always so brave?

947
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,500
Have another sip.

948
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:50,300
See? That wasn't so bad.

949
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:57,930
Well done. Helmut.

950
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:05,739
This medication makes sure you
don't get ill in this humid bunker.

951
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:08,860
But it's not humid in the bunker.

952
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:15,110
Well done.

953
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,420
Helga.

954
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,690
I don't want to.

955
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:35,350
- What's that? Do you want to get sick?
- Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

956
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:42,669
Don't cry, baby. That doesn't help.

957
02:00:42,670 --> 02:00:45,280
You have to drink the medicine.

958
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:50,500
Helga.

959
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:58,540
Come on, open your mouth.

960
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:21,740
Goodnight, children.

961
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:35,119
One day, the lie will fall apart...

962
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:38,770
...and there will be light in the darkness.

963
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,370
Please, read that.

964
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:47,110
One day, the lie will fall apart and
there will be light in the darkness.

965
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:51,809
Let's do it differently.
One day, the lie will collapse...

966
02:01:51,810 --> 02:01:57,019
...and truth will triumph once again.

967
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:01,199
At that moment we will
stand above everybody...

968
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:03,800
...pure and...

969
02:02:06,410 --> 02:02:09,020
immaculate.

970
02:06:15,550 --> 02:06:19,699
- We don't stand a chance.
- So what? I want to get away.

971
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:21,589
How do we get through the lines?

972
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:23,719
Doesn't matter. I'm not staying another minute.

973
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:27,770
- We'll die.
- It won't be that bad surely.

974
02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:30,920
If we stay, the Russians will get us for sure.

975
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:34,549
All the best.

976
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:37,160
Come, let's go.

977
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:12,239
<i>On April 30th, 1945, the Führer committed suicide...</i>

978
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:18,490
<i>...and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.</i>

979
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:24,229
<i>You German soldiers were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared..."</i>

980
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:31,009
<i>...to continue the battle for Berlin,
although ammunition was in short supply...</i>

981
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:36,229
<i>...and further resistance was pointless.</i>

982
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:40,400
<i>I hereby declare an immediate cease-fire.</i>

983
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:44,570
<i>Each hour you continue fighting...</i>

984
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:51,879
<i>...prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.</i>

985
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,049
<i>In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...</i>

986
02:08:56,050 --> 02:09:02,309
<i>...I order you to stop fighting immediately.</i>

987
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:10,130
<i>Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.</i>

988
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:13,780
A glass of water please.

989
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,430
I don't need you anymore.

990
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:27,370
The game's over.

991
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:37,189
Herr Doktor, it's time.

992
02:11:37,190 --> 02:11:41,330
- Don't you see what's going on here?
- I insist that you help us as a doctor.

993
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:44,460
Alright then.

994
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:56,940
Go. You did a lot. Thank you.

995
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:09,780
- Schädle, hurry. Come on.
- I'm not going anywhere anymore.

996
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:13,950
Come along.

997
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:55,150
- Are you alright?
- Keep going.

998
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:35,599
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

999
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:38,719
...and he receives the Iron Cross.

1000
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:43,409
Sturmmann Wagner took
out two machine-gun nests...

1001
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:47,059
...and therefore receives the Iron Cross.

1002
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:51,229
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

1003
02:13:51,230 --> 02:13:54,350
...and receives the Iron Cross.

1004
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,100
The others are coming.

1005
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:36,320
Take cover, Müller.

1006
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:56,990
Who's that?

1007
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:06,730
A German.

1008
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:13,910
Herr Hewel?

1009
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,640
Thank God you're alive.

1010
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:23,290
Where are the others?

1011
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:30,060
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

1012
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:33,709
Most people from my group must be dead.

1013
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:36,839
I should never have left that bunker.

1014
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:42,550
I should have shot myself, but I couldn't.

1015
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:47,760
Eat something first.
There's always enough time to die.

1016
02:16:44,450 --> 02:16:46,680
You stay with the women.

1017
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:49,570
Come along.

1018
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:06,049
- The Russians have surrounded us.
- What's going to happen to us?

1019
02:17:06,050 --> 02:17:09,169
Maybe you can get through. You could try.

1020
02:17:09,170 --> 02:17:11,260
I'm not taking another step.

1021
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:16,989
Think about it. The Russians are after us.

1022
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:22,720
As a woman you might
have a chance. Try it.

1023
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:25,320
Good luck.

1024
02:17:27,410 --> 02:17:32,099
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

1025
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:36,270
Remember that well. All the best.

1026
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:46,850
The Russians.

1027
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:02,039
- Gerda, let's go.
- You go.

1028
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:05,690
- I'm exhausted.
- Please.

1029
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:11,950
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

1030
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:17,690
I'll be alright.

1031
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:32,689
Herr Doktor.

1032
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:37,909
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

1033
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:42,079
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

1034
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:44,169
I'm obliged by my oath.

1035
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:49,390
Then you'd better go to the brigade leader.

1036
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:19,849
- The Russians are evacuating the square.
- So?

1037
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:22,459
No opposition. No shooting.

1038
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:25,089
Then they'll be here within the hour.

1039
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:28,479
What shall we do?

1040
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:32,749
- We can't surrender.
- What exactly do you mean?

1041
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:37,069
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

1042
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:40,719
- The last bullets are for ourselves.
- That's radical.

1043
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:46,460
Is this prestigious murder
and suicide our only option?

1044
02:19:46,470 --> 02:19:50,119
We're SS officers. We can't survive the Führer.

1045
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:52,870
Who agrees with me?

1046
02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:44,420
- Come and sit down with me?
- Please.

1047
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:55,970
- Why do you want to continue living?
- And you? Why do you want to die?

1048
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,660
See this?

1049
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:02,380
The Führer gave it to me personally.

1050
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:07,130
- As a last decoration?
- Maybe.

1051
02:22:07,150 --> 02:22:12,229
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

1052
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:17,260
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

1053
02:22:19,170 --> 02:22:23,840
Did he make you promise that? But why?

1054
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:29,820
Maybe he didn't want me to be forced
to say anything bad about him.

1055
02:22:29,830 --> 02:22:34,700
But as a diplomat you're
under international protection.

1056
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:38,050
Who will benefit if you stick to your deal?

1057
02:22:38,910 --> 02:22:40,330
There they are.

1058
02:22:53,720 --> 02:22:55,330
Don't shoot comrades.

1059
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:03,720
We surrendered. The war is over.

1060
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:07,100
It's over.

1061
02:24:40,930 --> 02:24:45,430

She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich until her death in 2002.

1097
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:25,667
All the horror I heard about
during the Nuremberg trial...

1098
02:27:25,668 --> 02:27:30,172
...the 6 million Jews dissidents
or people of another race...

1099
02:27:30,173 --> 02:27:36,279
...who died, shocked me deeply.

1100
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:41,119
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

1101
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,430
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

1102
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:52,270
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

1103
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:59,180
But one day I walked past
a commemorative plaque...

1104
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:05,930
...for Sophie Scholl here
in the Franz-Joseph Street.

1105
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:09,150
I saw that she was my age...

1106
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:15,530
...and that she was executed
in the year I joined Hitler.

1107
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:21,380
And only then did I realise...

1108
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:25,600
that youth is no excuse.

1109
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:33,210
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

1110
