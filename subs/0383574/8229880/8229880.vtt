If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.980
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

having found the key what unlocks it?

if you believe such things,

523
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.700
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.

524
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.340
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

525
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.940
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

526
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.620
The kraken.

527
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.980
They say the stench of its breath
is like... (SHUDDERS)

528
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.620
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

529
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.300
is the roar of the kraken

530
00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.500
and the reeking odor
of a thousand rotting corpses.

531
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.860
If you believe such things.

532
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.340
And the key will spare him that?

533
00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.580
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

534
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.140
Bad enough even to go visit...

535
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.220
...her.

536
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.180
Her?

537
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.340
Aye.

538
00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.980
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

539
00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:06.020
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

540
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.500
Were. Have been.

541
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.500
Before.

542
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.620
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

543
00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.140
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

544
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.580
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

545
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.820
Mind the boat.

546
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.340
(SQUAWKS) Mind the boat.

547

548
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.340
Tia Dalma.

549
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.620
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

550
00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.260
You...

551
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.340
You have a touch of...

552
00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.820
...destiny about you,

553
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.740
William Turner.

554
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.660
You know me?

555
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.380
You want to know me.

556
00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.060
There'll be no knowing here.

557
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.140
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.

558
00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.860
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

559
00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.100
- Come.
- Come.

560
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:29.260
What service may I do you?

561
00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.940
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment. (WHISTLES)

562
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.540
Look.

563
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.140
- (SCREECHING)
- An undead monkey.

564
00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.420
Top that.

565
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.260
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

566
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.220
The payment is fair.

567
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.300
We're looking for this.

568
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.700
And what it goes to.

569
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.780
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

570
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.260
Maybe. Why?

571
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.700
I hear you.

572
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.260
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

573
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.220
Or do you know,

574
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.180
but are loath to claim it as your own?

575
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.980
Your key go to a chest.

576
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.060
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

577
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.100
- What is inside?
- Gold?

578
00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.220
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

579
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.540
Nothing bad, I hope?

580
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.100
You know of Davy Jones,

581
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.780
yes?

582
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.620
A man of the sea.

583
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.980
A great sailor,

584
00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:02.060
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

585
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.220
- What vexes all men?
- (TIA DALMA CHUCKLING)

586
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.220
What indeed?

587
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.780
- The sea.
- Sums.

588
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.700
The dichotomy of good and evil.

589
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.220
A woman.

590
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.100
A woman.

591
00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.300
He fell in love.

592
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.340
No, no, no, no. I heard
it was the sea he fell in love with.

593
00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.380
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

594
00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.820
See, it was a woman

595
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.660
as changing and harsh

596
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:37.140
and untamable as the sea.

597
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.660
Him never stopped loving her.

598
00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:44.540
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

599
00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.340
but not enough to cause him to die.

600
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.540
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

601
00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.580
Him heart.

602
00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.820
Literally or figuratively?

603
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:02.380
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

604
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.500
Could he?

605
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.860
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

606
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.380
And so...

he keep with him at all times.

611
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:30.580
- You knew this.
- I did not.

612
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.260
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.

613
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.860
All that's left is climb aboard

Such a long time in such a mess.

623
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.780

Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

626
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.580
and so you will carry land with you.

627
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.860
Dirt.

628
00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.580
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

629
00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.820
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

630
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.900
If you don't want it, give it back.

631
00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:03.540
- No.
- Then it helps.

632
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.820
It seems we have a need
to find the <i>Flying Dutchman.

633

That's the <i>Flying Dutchman?

- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

Do not underestimate her.

638
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.780
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

639
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.340
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

ended up on the Flying Dutchman

1062
01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:20.780
It was found aboard the ship.

1063

bringing some omen of ill-fate.

- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

It brought good fortune.

1066
01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:34.980
The spirit told us,
"Pull in at Tortuga,"

1067

02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:18.220
Here! Come on!

1393
02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:21.460
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1394
02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:23.700
Come on!

1395
02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:51.780
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1396
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.540
(KRAKEN GROANING)

1397
02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:21.100
Did we kill it?

1398
02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.700
No. We just made it angry.

1399
02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:28.140
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1400
02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:32.740
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1401
02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.900
Jack. The <i>Pearl.

1402
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:41.500
She's only a ship, mate.

1403
02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:44.100
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1404
02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:47.300
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1405
02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:52.060
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the <i>Pearl.

1406
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:55.780
Abandon ship.

1407
02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:58.300
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1408
02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:17.180
Thank you, Jack.

1409
02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:21.980
We're not free yet, love.

1410
02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:24.300
You came back.

1411
02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:29.500
I always knew you were a good man.

1412
02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:45.300
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1413
02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.820
Come on, Will. Step to!

1414
02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.980
(CLICKING)

1415
02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:09.420
It's after you, not the ship.

1416
02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:12.420
It's not us.

1417
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:15.300
This is the only way, don't you see?

1418
02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:20.780
I'm not sorry.

1419
02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.300
Pirate.

1420
02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:49.860
Where's Jack?

1421
02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:56.060
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1422
02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:06.860
Go!

1423
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:24.140
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

1424
02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.860
(RUMBLING)

1425
02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:53.540
Come on!

1426
02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:01.580
Just got it. Come on.

1427
02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:18.780
(ROARING)

1428
02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:32.060
Not so bad.

1429
02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:35.540
Oh.

1430
02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:46.180
Hello, beastie.

1431
02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:39.260
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1432
02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:42.860
The captain goes down with his ship.

1433
02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:47.020
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1434
02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:53.420
Open the chest.

1435
02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:58.460
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1436
02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:01.180
(CREWMEN MURMURING)

1437
02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:20.140
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1438
02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:28.660
(MERCER) The last of our ships
has returned.

1439
02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.180
Is there any news on the chest?

1440
02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:35.900
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1441
02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:39.180
He had these.

1442
02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:49.260
(NORRINGTON) I took the liberty
of filling in my name.

1443
02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:00.860
If you intend to claim these, then
you must have something to trade.

1444
02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:03.620
Do you have the compass?

1445
02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:05.540
Better.

1446
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:10.580
(HEARTBEAT)

1447
02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:15.180
The heart of Davy Jones.

1448
02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:17.580
(FROGS CROAKING)

1449
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.740
(HUMMING)

1450
02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:13.140
Against the cold...

1451
02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:15.580
...and the sorrow.

1452
02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:28.420
It's a shame.

1453
02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:30.900
I know you're thinking that
with the <i>Pearl

1454
02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:34.740
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1455
02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:39.260
Doesn't matter now.

1456
02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:41.940
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,

1457
02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:43.980
along with its captain.

1458
02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:46.260
(GIBBS) Aye.

1459
02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:50.260
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1460
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:53.500
He fooled us all right till the end,

1461
02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:57.300
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1462
02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:01.940
To Jack Sparrow.

1463
02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:04.660
Never another like Captain Jack.

1464
02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:07.020
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1465
02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:09.700
He was a good man.

1466
02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:34.420
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1467
02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.860
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it? Hmm?

1468
02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:44.020
What would you... Hmm?

1469
02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:50.500
What would any of you
be willing to do, hmm?

1470
02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:55.620
Would you sail to the ends
of the Earth and beyond

1471
02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:00.780
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl?

1472
02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:08.180
Aye.

1473
02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:10.620
Aye.

1474
02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:12.420
Aye.

1475
02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:14.820
(SQUAWKS) Aye.

1476
02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:19.860
Yes.

1477
02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:23.340
Aye.

1478
02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:25.460
All right.

1479
02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:31.500
But if you go and brave
the weird and haunted shores

1480
02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:33.540
at world's end...

1481
02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:38.300
...then you will need a captain

1482
02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:40.980
who knows those waters.

1483
02:20:55.860 --> 02:21:00.020
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?

1484
02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.660
- (LAUGHING)
- (SCREECHING)

1485
02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:09.900
