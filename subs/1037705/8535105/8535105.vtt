1
00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:14.676
Nice.

2
00:08:14.843 --> 00:08:16.595
Nice, nice, nice.

3
00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:10.315
You hungry?

4
00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:13.443
You gotta come get it.
Don't play hard to get.

5
00:09:14.736 --> 00:09:16.071
You'll like it.

6
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.323
It's cat.

7
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:22.244
There you go.

8
00:09:24.329 --> 00:09:26.289
I don't know what...

9
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.545
Leave room for breakfast.

10
00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:33.601
Hello?

11
00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:39.274
Hello?

12
00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:48.283
Please.

13
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.993
Don't hurt me.

14
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.619
Here, take anything you want.

15
00:12:52.203 --> 00:12:54.164
You want some food?

16
00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:55.457
Take it.

17
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:00.712
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-Yeah?

18
00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:03.048
That's what the last guy said.

19
00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:05.967
Could...?

20
00:13:06.134 --> 00:13:08.303
Could you help me?
The wheel came off.

21
00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:11.765
I can't fix it.

22
00:13:12.015 --> 00:13:13.141
Maybe if I...

23
00:13:13.641 --> 00:13:15.268
If I could...

24
00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:17.062
...but I can't.

25
00:13:17.854 --> 00:13:20.899
You know, the only good thing
about no soap...

26
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.986
...is that you can smell hijackers
a mile off!

27
00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:28.531
I am impressed.

28
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.033
This man...

29
00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:34.954
...smelled us from 30 feet away.

30
00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:36.706
Damn.

31
00:13:36.873 --> 00:13:39.334
What's that say about our hygiene?

32
00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:43.505
What you got there in that pack?

33
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.923
What pack?

34
00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:47.884
He got a gun.

35
00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:50.512
Shit, it ain't loaded.

36
00:13:51.054 --> 00:13:53.389
Oh, they never are.

37
00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:56.643
Ain't that right, old man?

38
00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:03.900
Open the pack and tip it out
on the road nice and slow.

39
00:14:05.944 --> 00:14:07.695
Can't do that.

40
00:14:10.824 --> 00:14:13.284
Take off the fucking pack.

41
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.829
And put it on the ground.

42
00:14:16.037 --> 00:14:17.789
Or die!

43
00:14:17.914 --> 00:14:19.290
Ooh.

44
00:14:21.543 --> 00:14:23.378
Are you listening to me?

45
00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:25.672
I am now.

46
00:14:26.214 --> 00:14:28.007
-Good.
-You listening to me?

47
00:14:28.174 --> 00:14:30.218
-Yeah.
-Good.

48
00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:32.887
Put that hand on me again,
you won't get it back.

49
00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:39.477
Do you believe this fucking guy?

50
00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:42.272
All right, you wanna do it the hard way.

51
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:51.823
How did you do that?

52
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.325
He just cut my hand off.

53
00:14:59.122 --> 00:15:01.708
What are you standing around for?

54
00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:03.793
Kiss him!

55
00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.289
What did he say?

56
00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:08.173
He's in shock.

57
00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:12.302
I think he meant, "Kill him."

58
00:15:41.372 --> 00:15:42.790
I can't feel my hand.

59
00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:46.127
I can't feel my hand. My hand.

60
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:51.341
I told you,
you weren't gonna get that back.

61
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:59.015
Yeah.

62
00:15:59.182 --> 00:16:00.975
You did.

63
00:16:07.398 --> 00:16:09.234
Who are you?

64
00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:36.237
Where's your water?

65
00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.365
They don't have none.
They were gonna take yours.

66
00:17:39.532 --> 00:17:41.326
And then eat you.

67
00:17:41.492 --> 00:17:43.202
It's true.

68
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.167
It's in the cart.

69
00:18:21.032 --> 00:18:22.158
You're not taking it?

70
00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:25.870
-Where are you going?
-West.

71
00:18:26.037 --> 00:18:27.205
Can I come with you?

72
00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.998
No.

73
00:18:29.624 --> 00:18:31.042
But...

74
00:19:00.863 --> 00:19:02.615
Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:19:02.782 --> 00:19:04.617
We'll find shelter for tonight.

76
00:19:04.742 --> 00:19:06.202
My legs still hurt.

77
00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:10.373
Oh, God.

78
00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.502
It's all right.

79
00:19:21.342 --> 00:19:23.177
No. No! No.

80
00:19:23.344 --> 00:19:26.013
-Nice shot. Yeah.
-Mike. No.

81
00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:31.477
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeah.
-We've got her.

82
00:19:32.228 --> 00:19:33.938
Honey, come here.

83
00:19:34.063 --> 00:19:36.858
No. Oh, no.

84
00:19:37.024 --> 00:19:38.943
-Please, no, please.
-Stay on the path.

85
00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:41.154
God, no.

86
00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:43.865
-Don't! No!
-Come on, guys.

87
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.533
-Stay on the path.
-No, please!

88
00:19:45.658 --> 00:19:47.368
It's not your concern.

89
00:19:47.535 --> 00:19:50.329
-No!
-Now. Come on.

90
00:19:50.538 --> 00:19:53.040
-Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
-Oh, God.

91
00:19:53.207 --> 00:19:55.334
-Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
-No!

92
00:21:54.078 --> 00:21:56.539
-I don't know you.
-I know. I'm not from around here.

93
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:59.066
-No shit you're not from around here.
-I don't want trouble.

94
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.876
Okay. Ah!

95
00:22:02.545 --> 00:22:04.088
Okay.

96
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:08.384
I'm just a customer, okay?

97
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:10.219
Okay.

98
00:22:13.222 --> 00:22:14.932
I'm sorry, I gotta see the hands.

99
00:22:17.184 --> 00:22:18.352
I'm not one of them.

100
00:22:19.854 --> 00:22:21.355
Okay.

101
00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:24.066
I'm gonna take something
out of my pack.

102
00:22:25.568 --> 00:22:27.862
-Take your finger off the trigger.
-Yeah.

103
00:22:36.287 --> 00:22:39.707
Oh, sweet, that's a Fathom 900, man.

104
00:22:39.915 --> 00:22:40.958
Is it?

105
00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:44.420
-I haven't seen one of those since the '90s.
-Yeah, I got it back East.

106
00:22:44.587 --> 00:22:46.964
-Still work?
-Yeah, yeah. I just need it charged.

107
00:22:47.131 --> 00:22:49.967
Can you do that for me?
Give me a char... I got cables.

108
00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:53.429
I don't need the cables.
I can put a trickle charge on it.

109
00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.972
Good.

110
00:22:55.556 --> 00:22:57.308
I mean, if you got the coin.

111
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.894
Oh, yes, sir.

112
00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:03.689
Yes, I do. I got something...

113
00:23:06.984 --> 00:23:09.654
-Mm-hm. Okay.
-It's American made.

114
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.864
Oh, yeah.
I got a whole bunch of these.

115
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:13.324
-Do you?
-Yeah.

116
00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:14.909
You got any Chap Stick?

117
00:23:15.076 --> 00:23:16.952
No Chap Stick, no. I got cat oil.

118
00:23:17.244 --> 00:23:20.039
-Fresh cat oil.
-No, no.

119
00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:22.208
-It's good. It's good for the...
-No, no.

120
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:23.376
Works the same way.

121
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:25.920
What about toys? You got any toys?

122
00:23:26.087 --> 00:23:28.214
No, I don't play. Oh, I got...

123
00:23:31.634 --> 00:23:33.552
-Oh, yeah.
-"We do chicken right."

124
00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:36.681
-You know, "Finger licking good."
-Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right.

125
00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:38.057
Yeah, all right, all right.

126
00:23:38.224 --> 00:23:40.559
All right, now this with these.

127
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.395
Oh, absolutely. Those are yours.

128
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.313
Okay. Give me a couple of hours.

129
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.607
-I'll charge it for you.
-Thank you.

130
00:23:46.774 --> 00:23:49.110
You can wait across the street
at the Orpheum.

131
00:23:49.527 --> 00:23:50.861
No, I'll wait here.

132
00:23:51.737 --> 00:23:53.864
-Bar is about ready to open.
-I'll wait here.

133
00:23:54.365 --> 00:23:55.658
You don't trust me, do you?

134
00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:57.535
Uh...

135
00:24:00.454 --> 00:24:01.622
I'll wait here.

136
00:24:01.747 --> 00:24:02.873
All right.

137
00:24:22.893 --> 00:24:24.437
Yeah.

138
00:24:40.995 --> 00:24:42.705
Carnegie...

139
00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:46.250
...one of the road crews just
pulled into town.

140
00:24:46.417 --> 00:24:47.668
They've got something for you.

141
00:24:48.335 --> 00:24:49.378
Books?

142
00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:51.213
A whole bag of them.

143
00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:54.467
Tell them I wanna see them.

144
00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:55.926
Right now.

145
00:25:01.515 --> 00:25:02.558
Hey.

146
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.976
What's the problem?

147
00:25:04.143 --> 00:25:05.978
Come on, let's go.

148
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:11.442
We did good.

149
00:25:21.827 --> 00:25:23.662
The one you want...

150
00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:26.749
...it ain't there?

151
00:25:28.125 --> 00:25:29.168
No.

152
00:25:29.668 --> 00:25:31.378
I just don't understand.

153
00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:36.342
-That's a shitload of books.
-You don't have to understand.

154
00:25:36.717 --> 00:25:37.927
I understand.

155
00:25:38.093 --> 00:25:40.221
Leave that to me and we can be friends.

156
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:42.431
I have faith in you.

157
00:25:42.598 --> 00:25:44.266
You'll find it.

158
00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:47.311
Oh, wait.

159
00:25:47.603 --> 00:25:50.481
I got this too.

160
00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:59.532
Oh, now, this is a treat.

161
00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:03.828
-That's a shampoo.
-Yeah?

162
00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:06.539
Go get slammed.

163
00:26:06.747 --> 00:26:07.748
Yeah.

164
00:26:07.915 --> 00:26:09.792
Get some pussy.

165
00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:13.420
Everything on me, as much as you
and your boys can stand.

166
00:26:14.004 --> 00:26:16.006
Then go back on the road.

167
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.384
And we'll get you your book.

168
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:21.220
Of that I have no doubt.

169
00:26:26.684 --> 00:26:32.022
You're sending guys out who
can't even read to look for one book.

170
00:26:33.023 --> 00:26:35.276
No wonder they never find anything.

171
00:26:35.442 --> 00:26:38.237
Yeah, I use the tools I have at hand.

172
00:26:38.404 --> 00:26:40.739
Unless you'd like to go with them.

173
00:26:41.156 --> 00:26:42.575
Hm.

174
00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:48.372
What about these?

175
00:26:48.539 --> 00:26:50.207
Burn them.

176
00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:54.962
This place across the street,
they got any water?

177
00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:00.593
Yeah, if you can pay for it.

178
00:27:05.764 --> 00:27:07.683
Here.

179
00:27:08.142 --> 00:27:10.144
Smell this.

180
00:27:15.608 --> 00:27:18.068
One of the road crews found it.

181
00:27:19.528 --> 00:27:21.405
Who knows?

182
00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:26.285
It may be the last shampoo on the planet.

183
00:27:28.537 --> 00:27:31.457
And it's yours.

184
00:27:35.544 --> 00:27:37.755
Did they find your book?

185
00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:42.468
No.

186
00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:26.136
Outlander?

187
00:28:27.888 --> 00:28:28.931
Let me see.

188
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.645
-All right, what'll it be?
-Water.

189
00:28:37.564 --> 00:28:39.608
That's the good stuff.

190
00:28:40.025 --> 00:28:43.362
I've gotta eat into my own ration to sell it,
so it don't come cheap.

191
00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:45.155
Right.

192
00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:53.455
Get you maybe halfway.

193
00:29:17.104 --> 00:29:18.939
Solara.

194
00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:21.984
Yeah.

195
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:24.361
Take this and get it filled.

196
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.199
Wait.

197
00:29:29.366 --> 00:29:31.243
You need this.

198
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.720
Can you please move?

199
00:29:53.223 --> 00:29:54.892
Thank you.

200
00:30:09.698 --> 00:30:11.784
That was my cat.

201
00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:14.203
Uh...

202
00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.497
Fine specimen.

203
00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:19.124
I saw you knock him off the bar.

204
00:30:19.291 --> 00:30:22.086
No, I kind of shooed him.
I didn't really knock him.

205
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.545
You raised your hand at him.

206
00:30:23.712 --> 00:30:25.506
Won't happen again, I promise you.

207
00:30:25.672 --> 00:30:29.176
Hey, Martz.
How about another drink, huh?

208
00:30:29.802 --> 00:30:32.971
That cat's been coming in here
for two years.

209
00:30:33.764 --> 00:30:36.391
It's got more right to be here than you.

210
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:39.937
I don't want any trouble.

211
00:30:41.438 --> 00:30:44.108
Well, that's too bad because you got...

212
00:30:50.948 --> 00:30:52.741
I know who you are.

213
00:30:53.534 --> 00:30:57.246
Murderer of innocent travelers
on the road.

214
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.167
You are gonna be held to account
for the things you've done.

215
00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:03.627
Do you know that?

216
00:31:04.545 --> 00:31:05.587
Do you?

217
00:31:07.089 --> 00:31:08.507
Yes.

218
00:31:08.924 --> 00:31:10.551
It's okay.

219
00:31:14.972 --> 00:31:16.640
I'm gonna grab my things...

220
00:31:16.849 --> 00:31:19.143
-...and I'm gonna walk out of here.
-All right.

221
00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:21.812
-All right, brother?
-Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:31:22.104 --> 00:31:24.106
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

223
00:32:02.352 --> 00:32:04.771
Cursed be the ground...

224
00:32:05.439 --> 00:32:06.440
...for our sake.

225
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.279
Both thorns and thistles,
it shall bring forth...

226
00:32:12.946 --> 00:32:14.531
...for us.

227
00:32:15.949 --> 00:32:18.952
For out of the ground,
we were taken for the dust we are.

228
00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:24.833
And to the dust we shall return.

229
00:32:53.612 --> 00:32:55.239
Stop!

230
00:32:57.616 --> 00:32:59.409
Please.

231
00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:12.089
Redridge!

232
00:33:12.422 --> 00:33:13.799
Redridge?

233
00:33:27.938 --> 00:33:30.274
And who are you?

234
00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:32.234
Nobody.

235
00:33:33.402 --> 00:33:35.404
Oh, I doubt that.

236
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.365
The men you killed in my bar...

237
00:33:38.532 --> 00:33:40.617
...now, they were nobody.

238
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:42.786
-But you, now...
-He ain't got the shakes.

239
00:33:43.453 --> 00:33:45.914
-He ain't one of them.
-Good.

240
00:33:46.707 --> 00:33:48.458
This is a civilized town.

241
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.502
We don't eat humans.

242
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.964
We don't see too many people
from before.

243
00:33:54.131 --> 00:33:56.091
Not anymore.

244
00:33:57.551 --> 00:33:58.719
Do you read?

245
00:33:59.094 --> 00:34:00.220
Every day.

246
00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:02.014
All right.

247
00:34:02.222 --> 00:34:04.641
Well, good for you. Me too.

248
00:34:04.766 --> 00:34:06.059
You know, it's funny.

249
00:34:06.226 --> 00:34:11.273
As old as we are, people like you and me,
we're the future.

250
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.108
What do you want with me?

251
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:15.652
Straight to the point.

252
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.114
I like that.

253
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:21.366
I like that.

254
00:34:25.162 --> 00:34:26.830
You're not just educated.

255
00:34:28.415 --> 00:34:30.834
I never saw anyone handle themselves
the way you did.

256
00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:34.880
I don't know where you learned it,
but I sure as hell could use it.

257
00:34:35.756 --> 00:34:38.091
This little town...

258
00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:39.551
...just the beginning.

259
00:34:39.718 --> 00:34:41.678
I'm about to expand.

260
00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:44.181
I need expert help.
I could use someone like you.

261
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.893
Well, thank you,
but I'm really not interested.

262
00:34:48.477 --> 00:34:52.064
People who work for me live better than
any walker ever dreamed. Ask Redridge.

263
00:34:52.272 --> 00:34:54.316
Ask the boys, anyone.

264
00:34:54.816 --> 00:34:57.486
Real beds, hot food, women.

265
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.115
Clean water.

266
00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:05.202
You could do a lot worse, my friend.

267
00:35:06.536 --> 00:35:08.121
Thank you.

268
00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:11.917
But I got somewhere I need to be.

269
00:35:12.084 --> 00:35:13.752
Where?

270
00:35:14.503 --> 00:35:15.629
West.

271
00:35:16.213 --> 00:35:19.216
-There is nothing west.
-I've been told different.

272
00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.885
By who?

273
00:35:23.428 --> 00:35:24.805
Well...

274
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:27.974
Tell you what.

275
00:35:28.308 --> 00:35:30.268
Stay the night.

276
00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:33.814
Try a little local hospitality.
See how you like it.

277
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.690
We'll talk again in the morning.

278
00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:38.068
A word of advice, walker.

279
00:35:38.235 --> 00:35:39.861
It's not a choice.

280
00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:43.949
There's always a choice.

281
00:35:47.661 --> 00:35:50.664
There'll be someone
outside your room all night...

282
00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:52.541
...if you need anything.

283
00:35:52.749 --> 00:35:54.626
I don't need anything.

284
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.920
You never know.

285
00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:38.837
Yes. I know.

286
00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:49.598
This is for you.

287
00:36:50.307 --> 00:36:52.476
It's some water
for washing and some food.

288
00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:56.188
A little special reserve too.
Compliments of the house.

289
00:37:00.734 --> 00:37:04.112
I need you to take this or say
something so I can find you.

290
00:37:16.124 --> 00:37:17.584
Thank you.

291
00:37:17.834 --> 00:37:19.419
You're welcome.

292
00:37:19.586 --> 00:37:22.464
-Can I get you anything else?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

293
00:37:22.631 --> 00:37:25.550
You get blinded in the war
or by the sun after?

294
00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:30.305
I was born this way.

295
00:37:30.764 --> 00:37:32.057
I think probably I'm lucky...

296
00:37:32.224 --> 00:37:35.977
...because I was already used to being
like this by the time it happened.

297
00:37:36.436 --> 00:37:39.189
Right. Well, thank you for the food.

298
00:37:39.773 --> 00:37:40.857
You're welcome.

299
00:37:40.982 --> 00:37:42.526
Um...

300
00:37:43.485 --> 00:37:45.320
I like your perfume.

301
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.993
It's just shampoo.

302
00:37:52.702 --> 00:37:54.496
But thank you.

303
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.500
Good night.

304
00:38:22.315 --> 00:38:25.694
I don't think he's gonna change
his mind by the morning.

305
00:38:26.903 --> 00:38:28.947
He's not gonna stay.

306
00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:35.328
He's different than the others.

307
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:39.708
You're not gonna be able to make
him do what you want him to do.

308
00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.838
Who said anything about me?

309
00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:49.092
I'll send Solara.

310
00:38:52.762 --> 00:38:54.639
You can't do that.

311
00:38:54.848 --> 00:38:58.143
It's about time
I got better use out of her.

312
00:39:00.312 --> 00:39:01.938
Don't.

313
00:39:02.522 --> 00:39:04.190
Please.

314
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.401
Please, don't.

315
00:39:06.568 --> 00:39:10.739
Please. Please. Please.

316
00:39:10.905 --> 00:39:12.240
Please.

317
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.712
Can I come in?

318
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.966
Give me a minute.

319
00:39:38.892 --> 00:39:41.895
Somebody already came
with food and water.

320
00:39:44.356 --> 00:39:46.441
I got everything I need.

321
00:39:50.695 --> 00:39:52.614
Are you sure about that?

322
00:39:56.326 --> 00:39:59.204
It's really bright in here.

323
00:40:00.288 --> 00:40:02.999
-I'm Solara.
-Right.

324
00:40:03.458 --> 00:40:06.169
You filled my canteen downstairs.

325
00:40:06.336 --> 00:40:09.631
Yeah. You're the walker, right?

326
00:40:10.298 --> 00:40:11.716
Right.

327
00:40:14.636 --> 00:40:17.347
If you're worried about paying,
it's on the house.

328
00:40:17.514 --> 00:40:20.433
Look. Paying for what?

329
00:40:22.435 --> 00:40:24.521
Why don't you take a seat?

330
00:40:34.364 --> 00:40:35.532
No.

331
00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:39.077
No, I can't go.

332
00:40:39.244 --> 00:40:41.371
I can't. If I do, he'll hurt my mom.

333
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.125
-Who?
-Carnegie.

334
00:40:46.543 --> 00:40:47.585
He's your father?

335
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.423
No. No, but we belong to him
just the same.

336
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:56.344
Look, I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow
you can tell him you had a good time.

337
00:40:56.511 --> 00:40:59.764
I promise you, I will be no trouble.

338
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:04.644
Please.

339
00:41:11.234 --> 00:41:15.864
Knight to bishop four.

340
00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:24.956
Your move.

341
00:41:31.421 --> 00:41:36.092
-So how old are you?
-Excuse me?

342
00:41:36.634 --> 00:41:39.888
I haven't seen too many people
your age come through here before.

343
00:41:41.556 --> 00:41:44.601
Well, um, it's been...

344
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:50.940
...30 winters since the Flash.

345
00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:55.403
I really don't remember.

346
00:41:56.738 --> 00:41:58.990
Do you remember what it was like?

347
00:41:59.324 --> 00:42:02.494
-I mean, in the world before?
-Yeah.

348
00:42:06.122 --> 00:42:08.291
Well, what was it like?

349
00:42:12.086 --> 00:42:14.672
People had more than they needed.

350
00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:21.679
We had no idea what was precious,
what wasn't.

351
00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:30.021
We threw away things
people kill each other for now.

352
00:42:31.898 --> 00:42:33.608
-Really?
-Yeah.

353
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.320
-You have a book.
-Shh.

354
00:42:37.529 --> 00:42:39.072
-Can I see it?
-No, you cannot.

355
00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:41.908
-I just... I just wanna look at it.
-No. I said no.

356
00:42:42.033 --> 00:42:44.494
Listen, I can't even read.
Please let me just see it.

357
00:42:46.621 --> 00:42:50.625
-What is with you? It is just a book.
-It's not just a book.

358
00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:53.169
-What do you mean it's not just a book?
-Look.

359
00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:56.548
No more questions about the book,
all right? No more questions.

360
00:42:56.756 --> 00:42:58.132
All right?

361
00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:25.285
I got a question for you,
since you're here.

362
00:43:25.743 --> 00:43:28.162
Well, maybe I'll answer it
and maybe I won't.

363
00:43:30.248 --> 00:43:31.958
Where do you get your water?

364
00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.168
Can't tell you that.

365
00:43:34.335 --> 00:43:37.505
-You can't tell me or you don't know?
-Oh, I know.

366
00:43:38.214 --> 00:43:40.925
But if you're not talking about the book...

367
00:43:41.843 --> 00:43:44.053
...I'm not talking about the water.

368
00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:49.183
You're something else, you know.

369
00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:53.479
-All right, I got another question for you.
-Right.

370
00:43:53.646 --> 00:43:55.273
You hungry?

371
00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.984
There's a lot of food there.

372
00:43:58.318 --> 00:44:00.069
More than I can eat.

373
00:44:01.154 --> 00:44:07.744
Tell you what. We can share it,
you know, like old people used to.

374
00:44:09.537 --> 00:44:12.665
-Okay.
-Okay?

375
00:44:17.003 --> 00:44:19.589
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait. Sit.

376
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.092
Sit.

377
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:27.597
This'll be for you.

378
00:44:27.972 --> 00:44:29.265
Give me your hands.

379
00:44:31.392 --> 00:44:35.104
-What are you doing?
-Trust me. Give me your hands.

380
00:44:39.484 --> 00:44:41.319
Close your eyes.

381
00:44:43.071 --> 00:44:45.990
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.

382
00:44:46.157 --> 00:44:49.535
We thank you for a warm bed...

383
00:44:49.661 --> 00:44:54.332
...and a roof over our head
on cold nights such as this.

384
00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:56.417
It's been too long.

385
00:44:56.751 --> 00:44:59.212
-Is this from your book?
-Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

386
00:44:59.379 --> 00:45:01.965
Don't interrupt.
Close your eyes.

387
00:45:03.925 --> 00:45:08.304
We thank you
for the gift of companionship...

388
00:45:08.471 --> 00:45:11.015
...in hard times like these.

389
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:13.101
Amen.

390
00:45:17.605 --> 00:45:19.273
Now we eat?

391
00:45:20.358 --> 00:45:21.859
Now we eat.

392
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:54.851
Good morning, Solara.

393
00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.896
How was your night?
Did you sleep well?

394
00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.523
I did like you said.

395
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.359
Oh, of course you did what I said.

396
00:46:04.235 --> 00:46:05.945
But did it work?

397
00:46:06.738 --> 00:46:08.114
Is he staying?

398
00:46:08.531 --> 00:46:10.867
We didn't do much talking.

399
00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:13.870
Solara, honey, eat something.

400
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:19.584
Mom, give me your hand.

401
00:46:21.878 --> 00:46:23.629
Close your eyes.

402
00:46:24.255 --> 00:46:25.673
Mom, trust me.

403
00:46:32.388 --> 00:46:33.723
Dear Lord.

404
00:46:35.683 --> 00:46:38.144
We thank you for our food.

405
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.397
Thank you for my mother.

406
00:46:42.815 --> 00:46:46.986
Thank you for the roof over our heads
and our new friends.

407
00:46:49.447 --> 00:46:51.324
And, uh...

408
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.248
Well, I guess that's all for now.

409
00:46:59.832 --> 00:47:01.417
Amen.

410
00:47:07.173 --> 00:47:09.926
That's the word you're looking for.
Amen.

411
00:47:12.386 --> 00:47:14.388
That's how you stop.

412
00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:23.606
You said you didn't talk much.

413
00:47:25.441 --> 00:47:27.819
But did he do any reading?

414
00:47:29.904 --> 00:47:31.239
I asked you a question.

415
00:47:31.405 --> 00:47:36.285
-Bill, don't.
-You shut your mouth.

416
00:47:48.381 --> 00:47:50.049
You're hurting your mother, Solara.

417
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:52.969
He said he read every day.

418
00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.595
Did he?

419
00:47:55.096 --> 00:47:56.973
Stop it.

420
00:47:57.515 --> 00:48:01.394
-Your mother would like you to tell me.
-I don't know.

421
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.397
I don't know.

422
00:48:09.569 --> 00:48:12.196
Yes, okay. Yes, yes, he was reading.

423
00:48:12.947 --> 00:48:15.825
-What kind of book was he reading?
-I don't know. I don't know.

424
00:48:15.992 --> 00:48:17.451
-An old leather one.
-And?

425
00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.624
I don't know, it had some kind
of thing on the front of it.

426
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:25.960
-Show me.
-I need you to let her go.

427
00:48:26.127 --> 00:48:28.462
Show me!

428
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:35.678
I don't know.

429
00:48:40.975 --> 00:48:42.727
Redridge!

430
00:48:54.822 --> 00:48:57.408
Shit.
He was here the whole night.

431
00:48:57.575 --> 00:48:59.327
Where is he?

432
00:48:59.994 --> 00:49:02.705
I don't... I don't...

433
00:49:06.626 --> 00:49:09.795
And I just wanna make sure
that you know... There's no acid in there.

434
00:49:09.962 --> 00:49:12.924
-That's swamp water.
-It doesn't matter. Just take these off.

435
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.884
-Take them off.
-Let... All right. Just...

436
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:16.344
-Hey.
-All right, all right.

437
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.638
-Coming off. Coming off.
-It's okay. Thank you.

438
00:49:18.804 --> 00:49:21.557
You can tell them I made you do it,
all right?

439
00:49:21.682 --> 00:49:23.851
-Say it.
-You made me do it.

440
00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:53.089
Is that thing loaded?
I don't think it's loaded.

441
00:49:53.422 --> 00:49:55.633
One way to find out.

442
00:49:55.716 --> 00:49:58.386
Look, I need that book.

443
00:49:59.387 --> 00:50:02.223
I mean, I want the book.

444
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:07.186
And you. But if you make me choose,
I'll kill you, I'll take the book.

445
00:50:09.438 --> 00:50:11.065
Why? Why do you want it?

446
00:50:13.192 --> 00:50:15.319
I grew up with it.

447
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:17.989
I know its power.

448
00:50:18.572 --> 00:50:21.200
And if you read it, then so do you.

449
00:50:21.701 --> 00:50:24.912
That's why they burned them all
after the war.

450
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:31.585
Just staying alive is an act of faith.
Building this town is an even bigger act of faith.

451
00:50:31.752 --> 00:50:33.963
But they don't understand that.

452
00:50:34.714 --> 00:50:36.173
None of them.

453
00:50:36.799 --> 00:50:41.762
And I don't have the right words
to help them, but the book does.

454
00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:48.144
Now, I admit that I've had to do things...

455
00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:51.939
...many, many things that I hate
to build this, I confess that.

456
00:50:53.941 --> 00:50:59.030
But if we have that book,
I wouldn't have to.

457
00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:02.158
Now, imagine...

458
00:51:02.825 --> 00:51:06.329
Imagine how different,
how righteous this little world could be...

459
00:51:06.495 --> 00:51:08.831
...if we had the right words for our faith.

460
00:51:08.998 --> 00:51:11.542
The people would truly understand
why they're here...

461
00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:14.962
...and they wouldn't need
any of the uglier motivations.

462
00:51:17.298 --> 00:51:22.011
It's not right to keep that book hidden away.
It's meant to be shared with others.

463
00:51:22.219 --> 00:51:24.513
It's meant to be spread.

464
00:51:25.181 --> 00:51:26.599
Isn't that what you want?

465
00:51:26.766 --> 00:51:29.143
With all my heart and soul.

466
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.522
I always believed that I'd find a place...

467
00:51:33.689 --> 00:51:38.486
...where this book belonged,
where it was needed.

468
00:51:41.572 --> 00:51:43.657
But I haven't found it yet.

469
00:51:49.205 --> 00:51:51.582
I love this guy.

470
00:51:56.587 --> 00:51:58.089
I love this guy.

471
00:52:02.802 --> 00:52:04.553
Shoot him, please.

472
00:52:25.866 --> 00:52:27.910
What are you standing around for?

473
00:52:29.328 --> 00:52:31.872
Take him out, goddamn it!
Take him out!

474
00:54:36.205 --> 00:54:38.832
I don't like being followed.

475
00:54:39.416 --> 00:54:40.960
I wanna come with you.

476
00:54:41.126 --> 00:54:42.628
No, you don't.

477
00:54:42.753 --> 00:54:44.797
I hate it here.

478
00:54:45.923 --> 00:54:46.924
Then change it.

479
00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:49.510
My mother thinks
I'll be safer with you.

480
00:54:54.723 --> 00:54:57.268
I'll take you to where we get our water.

481
00:54:57.893 --> 00:55:00.938
You can have all that you can carry.

482
00:55:09.655 --> 00:55:12.491
I mean, all that we can carry.

483
00:55:17.204 --> 00:55:20.374
Carnegie knows about
two more springs up north.

484
00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:23.377
He says he's gonna build more towns.

485
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.338
How did he know about this one?

486
00:55:26.505 --> 00:55:27.548
He'd been here.

487
00:55:28.465 --> 00:55:30.509
When he was young.

488
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:33.721
In the world before.

489
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.391
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

490
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:42.271
We really better hurry.

491
00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:49.153
Shoot. I think I left my glasses
inside. Take a look for me.

492
00:55:49.361 --> 00:55:51.697
-I'll look out here.
-Okay.

493
00:55:57.828 --> 00:55:59.747
What are you doing?

494
00:56:02.458 --> 00:56:05.044
You are such a liar.

495
00:56:08.172 --> 00:56:09.214
I'm not a liar.

496
00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:12.092
You said I could come with you
if you got your water.

497
00:56:12.259 --> 00:56:14.970
I didn't say that. You said that.

498
00:56:15.137 --> 00:56:17.765
Besides, the road's no place for you.

499
00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.392
It's much worse than you think.

500
00:56:21.352 --> 00:56:24.104
Goodbye, Solara.
It's nice knowing you. I mean that.

501
00:56:24.271 --> 00:56:26.732
-Hey.
-Yeah?

502
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.941
Fuck you!

503
00:56:43.582 --> 00:56:45.793
Have you washed
your filthy fucking hands?

504
00:56:45.959 --> 00:56:47.503
Twice.

505
00:56:47.795 --> 00:56:49.505
With your soap.

506
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:55.052
Put a crew together.
We're going after him.

507
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.637
For a fucking book.

508
00:56:56.804 --> 00:57:00.265
It's not a fucking book!

509
00:57:00.432 --> 00:57:02.685
It's a weapon.

510
00:57:03.519 --> 00:57:07.940
A weapon aimed right at the hearts
and minds of the weak and the desperate.

511
00:57:08.107 --> 00:57:10.651
It will give us control of them.

512
00:57:12.111 --> 00:57:15.948
If we wanna rule
more than one small fucking town...

513
00:57:16.115 --> 00:57:19.743
...we have to have it.
People will come from all over.

514
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:25.499
They'll do exactly what I tell them
if the words are from the book.

515
00:57:29.086 --> 00:57:31.130
It's happened before.

516
00:57:31.338 --> 00:57:33.632
And it'll happen again.

517
00:57:33.757 --> 00:57:36.051
All we need is that book.

518
00:57:50.399 --> 00:57:52.568
Then I want Solara.

519
00:57:57.322 --> 00:57:59.950
Are you bargaining with me?

520
00:58:01.118 --> 00:58:03.954
Is this a deal we're making here?

521
00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:08.000
We lost a lot of men.

522
00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:10.461
You need me more than ever.

523
00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.131
Now, you say that book's
worth the trouble.

524
00:58:14.339 --> 00:58:16.467
Well, I believe you.

525
00:58:17.926 --> 00:58:20.304
But I want Solara for it.

526
00:58:30.439 --> 00:58:31.857
Oh...

527
00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:34.276
Why not?

528
00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:36.528
Why not?

529
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:39.490
Let's get the fuck out of here.

530
00:58:39.907 --> 00:58:42.117
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

531
00:58:42.284 --> 00:58:44.787
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

532
00:58:44.953 --> 00:58:48.373
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

533
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.275
Which way are we headed?

534
00:59:16.026 --> 00:59:17.694
West.

535
00:59:56.692 --> 00:59:58.527
Hello?

536
00:59:59.194 --> 01:00:01.697
Can anyone help me?

537
01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:05.826
Hello? Is anybody there?

538
01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:16.044
Are you okay?

539
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.257
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

540
01:00:20.465 --> 01:00:22.759
You go along. I'll be okay.

541
01:00:22.968 --> 01:00:26.179
-No, here, let me just help you.
-No. No, really, please. I'm fine.

542
01:00:26.346 --> 01:00:30.225
Really, I need a man to help, not you.

543
01:00:30.392 --> 01:00:31.518
You just go along.

544
01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:34.813
-It's okay, it'll just take a minute.
-No, it's fine.

545
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.607
Please.

546
01:00:55.542 --> 01:01:00.339
Help! Somebody... Help me.
Get off me.

547
01:01:00.505 --> 01:01:02.549
Help! Help!

548
01:01:02.716 --> 01:01:04.635
Help!

549
01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:11.475
Get off me!

550
01:01:45.258 --> 01:01:47.427
Help me.

551
01:02:00.023 --> 01:02:01.692
Thank you.

552
01:03:20.437 --> 01:03:22.481
Over there.

553
01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.157
-What's wrong?
-Shh.

554
01:03:33.033 --> 01:03:34.659
You hear that?

555
01:03:35.744 --> 01:03:37.287
Hear what?

556
01:03:41.374 --> 01:03:44.544
Don't move. Don't move.

557
01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.937
Here, take the wire off of that.

558
01:04:02.145 --> 01:04:03.897
Spool it up.

559
01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:07.901
-What is that?
-Dinner.

560
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.840
It's like he's protected somehow.

561
01:04:30.632 --> 01:04:33.176
Like there's nothing that can touch him.

562
01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:37.806
Oh, he's just a fucking man.

563
01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:42.686
You put a bullet in him,
he'll go down like any other.

564
01:04:47.774 --> 01:04:49.693
Still warm.

565
01:04:52.696 --> 01:04:55.240
No more than a few hours dead.

566
01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.787
He can't be far.

567
01:05:07.544 --> 01:05:10.088
Son of a bitch.

568
01:05:12.716 --> 01:05:14.509
Solara.

569
01:05:15.385 --> 01:05:17.846
Are you sure you still want her?

570
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:24.853
It's gonna be dark soon.
We can't track them at night.

571
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.813
They'll see us coming.

572
01:05:27.022 --> 01:05:29.983
We could drive right past them
and never know it.

573
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:32.527
He's right.

574
01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:36.698
They're on foot, tired.
They'll have to sleep.

575
01:05:38.575 --> 01:05:40.869
We'll make up the ground tomorrow.

576
01:05:40.994 --> 01:05:43.371
We'll have them before morning's out.

577
01:05:44.497 --> 01:05:47.167
That better be a guarantee.

578
01:06:04.017 --> 01:06:05.810
Do you really read the same book
every day?

579
01:06:06.978 --> 01:06:08.730
Without fail.

580
01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:13.902
Will you read some to me?

581
01:06:16.905 --> 01:06:18.531
Please?

582
01:06:23.828 --> 01:06:25.789
The Lord is my shepherd...

583
01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:29.251
...I shall not want.

584
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:34.756
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures...

585
01:06:35.924 --> 01:06:38.927
...leads me beside the still waters.

586
01:06:39.094 --> 01:06:42.222
He restores my soul.

587
01:06:42.973 --> 01:06:47.769
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness,
for his name's sake.

588
01:06:51.314 --> 01:06:55.110
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

589
01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:57.654
...I will fear no evil...

590
01:06:58.321 --> 01:06:59.739
...for thou art with me.

591
01:07:00.865 --> 01:07:03.952
-That's beautiful.
-You like that?

592
01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:07.122
-Did you write that?
-Yes, I did.

593
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:10.375
-Really?
-No, no.

594
01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:11.835
No.

595
01:07:12.002 --> 01:07:16.715
No, that was around a long time
before you and I got here, that's for sure.

596
01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.635
Um...

597
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.932
What did you mean when you said
it's not just any book?

598
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.610
It's the only one.

599
01:07:39.904 --> 01:07:41.281
Really?

600
01:07:41.448 --> 01:07:44.951
After the war, people made it their
business to find...

601
01:07:45.118 --> 01:07:47.579
...and destroy any that the fires
didn't get already.

602
01:07:47.704 --> 01:07:51.207
Some people said this was the reason
for the war in the first place.

603
01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:56.171
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.

604
01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.134
How did you get it?

605
01:08:06.556 --> 01:08:10.935
They said that the war
tore a hole in the sky.

606
01:08:11.061 --> 01:08:13.021
-You've probably heard the stories.
-Yeah.

607
01:08:14.147 --> 01:08:20.278
Tore a hole in the sky,
sun came down and burned everything.

608
01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:23.073
Everything and everybody.

609
01:08:23.448 --> 01:08:28.578
You were lucky to hole up and hide
in a place like this or underground.

610
01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:32.582
Most people weren't lucky.

611
01:08:35.794 --> 01:08:37.420
So a year later...

612
01:08:37.587 --> 01:08:39.506
...we started coming out, and we...

613
01:08:39.672 --> 01:08:42.008
People wandered around.

614
01:08:42.217 --> 01:08:47.305
Not knowing what I was gonna do,
trying to find a place to survive.

615
01:08:48.056 --> 01:08:51.810
One day, I heard a voice.

616
01:08:52.185 --> 01:08:54.979
It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

617
01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:58.233
Like it was coming from inside of me.

618
01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:03.196
But I could hear it as clear
as I can hear you talking to me now.

619
01:09:03.696 --> 01:09:05.115
What did this voice say?

620
01:09:06.157 --> 01:09:07.909
It led me.

621
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.912
To a place where I found the book...

622
01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:14.416
...buried under some rubble.

623
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.756
The voice told me
to carry the book out west.

624
01:09:22.757 --> 01:09:26.428
Told me that a path
would be laid out for me...

625
01:09:26.594 --> 01:09:31.975
...that I'd be led to a place
where the book was safe.

626
01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:37.105
Told me that I'd be protected...

627
01:09:38.356 --> 01:09:41.943
...against anyone or anything
that stood in my path.

628
01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.865
And I've been walking ever since.

629
01:09:48.658 --> 01:09:51.536
And you did all that because a voice
in your head told you to?

630
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:55.081
Yes, I did.

631
01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.041
I know what I heard.

632
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:59.711
I know what I hear.

633
01:10:00.003 --> 01:10:01.212
I know I'm not crazy.

634
01:10:02.547 --> 01:10:06.259
And I know I would've never made it
without help.

635
01:10:06.968 --> 01:10:09.220
-What's that?
-One question too many.

636
01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:12.765
Go to bed,
we got a early start in the morning.

637
01:10:50.803 --> 01:10:52.305
Hey.

638
01:11:03.983 --> 01:11:05.443
Hey.

639
01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:16.621
What are you doing?

640
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:19.141
I'm sorry,
I thought you were sleeping.

641
01:11:19.165 --> 01:11:21.459
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?

642
01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:24.045
I just wanted to see the book.

643
01:11:24.254 --> 01:11:26.339
Nobody touches it but me,
you understand me?

644
01:11:27.799 --> 01:11:30.468
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand.

645
01:11:30.635 --> 01:11:32.637
Good. Go to sleep.

646
01:11:42.063 --> 01:11:44.607
Said you don't know how to read anyway.
It's no use to you.

647
01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:46.526
Yeah.

648
01:11:47.151 --> 01:11:48.444
So teach me.

649
01:12:08.923 --> 01:12:11.259
Hold up. Hold up. Stop.

650
01:12:16.889 --> 01:12:19.309
You say you've been walking
for 30 years, right?

651
01:12:19.475 --> 01:12:20.727
Right.

652
01:12:20.893 --> 01:12:22.729
You ever thought maybe
you were lost?

653
01:12:22.895 --> 01:12:23.896
Nope.

654
01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:26.386
Do you know
you're walking in the right direction?

655
01:12:26.524 --> 01:12:27.859
Walk by faith, not by sight.

656
01:12:29.861 --> 01:12:30.981
What does that mean?

657
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:34.741
It means that you know something
even if you don't know something.

658
01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:37.994
-Doesn't make any sense.
-Doesn't have to make sense, it's faith.

659
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:40.997
"It's the flower of light
in the field of darkness...

660
01:12:41.205 --> 01:12:43.499
...giving me strength to carry on."
You understand?

661
01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:44.917
Is that from your book?

662
01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:49.631
No, it's Johnny Cash live at Folsom Prison.

663
01:12:49.756 --> 01:12:50.882
What?

664
01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:15.490
Do you think anyone lives there?

665
01:13:15.615 --> 01:13:17.367
I don't know.

666
01:13:18.534 --> 01:13:20.495
Maybe there's water.

667
01:13:30.046 --> 01:13:32.048
Stay behind me.

668
01:13:36.886 --> 01:13:38.846
This is weird.

669
01:14:13.589 --> 01:14:14.799
Who are you?

670
01:14:18.636 --> 01:14:19.971
We're travelers, that's all.

671
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:21.431
Don't mean any harm.

672
01:14:21.597 --> 01:14:24.016
No trespassing.
Haven't you read the sign?

673
01:14:24.517 --> 01:14:27.061
Uh, we're very sorry. I didn't see it.

674
01:14:28.104 --> 01:14:29.522
What's your business?

675
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:31.566
-We were just...
-No business. Just...

676
01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:35.236
We're very sorry, and if you let us,
we'll be on our way.

677
01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:37.613
George, look at them.

678
01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.741
-One of them is just a girl.
-Yeah.

679
01:14:39.907 --> 01:14:43.035
It's an old story,
I've heard it a hundred times before.

680
01:14:43.202 --> 01:14:45.163
We get so few visitors these days.

681
01:14:45.329 --> 01:14:47.790
George is suspicious of everybody.

682
01:14:47.957 --> 01:14:49.667
I'm Martha.

683
01:14:49.834 --> 01:14:52.170
Would you care for some tea?

684
01:15:02.346 --> 01:15:03.723
How about some music?

685
01:15:04.056 --> 01:15:05.892
It's so soothing.

686
01:15:06.058 --> 01:15:07.643
George.

687
01:15:22.241 --> 01:15:23.618
Oh.

688
01:15:27.079 --> 01:15:28.122
How do you like it?

689
01:15:28.247 --> 01:15:29.874
It's nice.

690
01:15:30.041 --> 01:15:31.626
Please.

691
01:15:39.884 --> 01:15:42.136
-Ahem.
-Is that good?

692
01:15:42.303 --> 01:15:46.182
-Good, good. That's... Taste is rich.
-Mm. Mm-hm. Mm.

693
01:15:46.766 --> 01:15:48.142
Mm-hm.

694
01:15:50.228 --> 01:15:53.439
It's amazing that you two have survived
out here all by yourselves.

695
01:15:53.898 --> 01:15:57.443
Well, now, George is something
of a handyman.

696
01:15:59.529 --> 01:16:02.824
He did a lot of work on this place,
making it safe.

697
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:04.742
We may be old, but we're resilient.

698
01:16:06.202 --> 01:16:09.121
We've known more than a few who've
tried to take this place from us.

699
01:16:09.288 --> 01:16:10.998
-Haven't we, George?
-Yes, we have.

700
01:16:11.457 --> 01:16:12.500
Right.

701
01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:15.545
-I wanna show you something. Come on.
-George, no.

702
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:17.255
Not now.

703
01:16:17.421 --> 01:16:19.006
Come on.

704
01:16:21.425 --> 01:16:23.761
-Are these...?
-Graves? Sure.

705
01:16:23.928 --> 01:16:26.013
Be uncivilized not to bury them.

706
01:16:26.222 --> 01:16:29.350
Besides, it's good for the soil.

707
01:16:29.559 --> 01:16:33.145
Come on back inside. I think I might be
able to rustle you up some sandwiches.

708
01:16:33.312 --> 01:16:36.274
Well, thank you, thank you very much.
We gotta go now.

709
01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.818
-They killed people.
-Not just kill them, ate them.

710
01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:41.445
-Her hands were shaking.
-Too much human meat. Let's go.

711
01:16:42.363 --> 01:16:45.032
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.

712
01:16:45.199 --> 01:16:46.659
Nope. No, thank you.

713
01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:49.579
Well, we gotta be going.

714
01:16:49.787 --> 01:16:51.831
-So soon?
-Yeah, I'm afraid so.

715
01:16:51.998 --> 01:16:53.438
Are you sure you won't stay?

716
01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:54.750
I'm sure, I'm very sure.

717
01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.460
Put the gun down.

718
01:16:56.586 --> 01:16:58.588
Solara, take this.
Open the door, please.

719
01:16:58.754 --> 01:17:00.756
-Say thank you for the tea.
-Thank you.

720
01:17:00.923 --> 01:17:01.966
Thank you for the tea.

721
01:17:09.849 --> 01:17:11.851
Go back inside.

722
01:17:15.438 --> 01:17:16.598
George, what's wrong?

723
01:17:16.689 --> 01:17:18.983
A whole company of armed degenerates,
that's what's wrong.

724
01:17:19.108 --> 01:17:20.860
And they led them straight to us.

725
01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:23.988
-Oh, no. I just set out the good china.
-Fuck the china.

726
01:17:24.155 --> 01:17:25.740
Have you got any more weapons?

727
01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:29.160
Weapons?
I'll show you some weapons.

728
01:17:31.495 --> 01:17:33.915
-Can you shoot a gun?
-Of course.

729
01:17:35.249 --> 01:17:37.126
Come on, come on.

730
01:17:37.335 --> 01:17:39.879
<i>We know you're in there.</i>

731
01:17:40.463 --> 01:17:44.050
<i>Come on out and nobody needs get hurt.</i>

732
01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.639
<i>I'll make it easy.</i>

733
01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:53.059
Send out Solara with the book.

734
01:17:53.225 --> 01:17:55.770
-What are we gonna do?
-I know what the fuck I'm doing.

735
01:17:55.895 --> 01:17:57.897
-Wait, wait, wait.
-That's all I want...

736
01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:01.442
<i>...is the book and the girl.</i>

737
01:18:02.485 --> 01:18:04.654
They ain't coming out.

738
01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:31.305
Oh, shit!

739
01:18:31.472 --> 01:18:34.308
-Get down! Everybody, get down!
-Move, move, move!

740
01:18:52.493 --> 01:18:55.121
Hey, you know that voice you heard?

741
01:18:55.287 --> 01:18:56.998
Did it say anything about this?

742
01:18:57.206 --> 01:18:59.500
We'll get out alive, both of us.

743
01:18:59.709 --> 01:19:01.836
What about us?

744
01:19:02.044 --> 01:19:04.171
Didn't mention you.

745
01:19:12.805 --> 01:19:14.932
Cease fire!

746
01:19:15.057 --> 01:19:17.393
Cease fire!

747
01:19:27.194 --> 01:19:28.320
Martha?

748
01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:30.990
Martha? Martha.

749
01:19:31.449 --> 01:19:33.284
Martha.

750
01:19:35.453 --> 01:19:37.872
-Martha.
-Go around the side.

751
01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:40.541
-Around the side.
-You bastards.

752
01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:42.126
The side of the house.

753
01:19:42.293 --> 01:19:44.754
You fucking bastards.

754
01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:51.453
-Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
-Back it up.

755
01:19:51.552 --> 01:19:54.388
-What are they doing?
-Nothing good.

756
01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:04.190
Aah!

757
01:21:08.379 --> 01:21:10.256
Where's the book?

758
01:21:16.887 --> 01:21:18.848
Check his pack.

759
01:21:36.949 --> 01:21:37.992
It ain't here.

760
01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:43.414
This is your last chance.

761
01:21:43.581 --> 01:21:47.168
You give it up or I swear
I'll bury you out here.

762
01:21:56.969 --> 01:21:58.637
Son of a bitch.

763
01:21:58.804 --> 01:22:01.015
Let's try this again.

764
01:22:05.644 --> 01:22:08.022
-Carnegie!
-What?

765
01:22:17.573 --> 01:22:21.869
Now, where's the book?

766
01:22:26.248 --> 01:22:29.084
Give him the book, please.

767
01:22:33.172 --> 01:22:35.507
Don't tell him.

768
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:47.728
It's in the house, back of the TV.

769
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.314
Go check the TV.

770
01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.942
The what?

771
01:22:53.108 --> 01:22:55.486
You're fucking shitting me.
You go!

772
01:22:56.153 --> 01:22:57.738
Go!

773
01:23:33.148 --> 01:23:37.278
Ask, and you shall receive.

774
01:23:41.865 --> 01:23:44.368
God is good, is he not?

775
01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:46.912
All the time.

776
01:23:49.081 --> 01:23:50.916
Not all the time.

777
01:24:16.191 --> 01:24:17.901
No!

778
01:24:18.068 --> 01:24:19.695
No!

779
01:25:04.615 --> 01:25:05.783
You see?

780
01:25:08.202 --> 01:25:10.120
What did I tell you?

781
01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:17.544
He's just a man.

782
01:25:21.256 --> 01:25:23.884
No! Leave him alone!

783
01:25:24.718 --> 01:25:27.262
Please, stop!

784
01:25:32.851 --> 01:25:35.354
Where's your protection now?

785
01:25:36.647 --> 01:25:37.731
Hm?

786
01:25:50.077 --> 01:25:52.037
Pray for me.

787
01:25:54.957 --> 01:25:56.542
Okay?

788
01:26:00.003 --> 01:26:02.589
I... I mean it.

789
01:27:19.082 --> 01:27:20.334
Aah!

790
01:27:20.542 --> 01:27:22.085
No!

791
01:27:29.384 --> 01:27:31.053
Shit.

792
01:27:32.137 --> 01:27:33.972
Go back!

793
01:28:17.224 --> 01:28:19.059
Come on! Come on!

794
01:29:18.785 --> 01:29:22.664
We barely got enough fuel to make it back.
You wanna go after her?

795
01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:25.792
No.

796
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.333
Where are you going?

797
01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:52.087
I'm going west. Gotta go west.

798
01:30:53.797 --> 01:30:55.257
Hey.

799
01:31:02.264 --> 01:31:03.682
Here.

800
01:31:20.407 --> 01:31:21.658
I'm sorry.

801
01:31:22.325 --> 01:31:23.702
For what?

802
01:31:24.411 --> 01:31:26.580
-This. This is all my fault.
-No, it's not.

803
01:31:26.705 --> 01:31:29.958
No, it is. If I didn't come with you,
none of this would've happened.

804
01:31:30.125 --> 01:31:31.543
Ow.

805
01:31:31.793 --> 01:31:33.962
It's not your fault.

806
01:31:36.131 --> 01:31:37.674
I did what I had to do.

807
01:31:38.175 --> 01:31:41.261
I didn't think anything
could make you give up that book.

808
01:31:41.678 --> 01:31:43.889
I thought it was too important.

809
01:31:46.558 --> 01:31:50.562
All the years I've been carrying it
and reading it every day...

810
01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:55.484
...I got so caught up with keeping it safe...

811
01:31:55.692 --> 01:32:00.197
...I forgot to live by what I learned from it.

812
01:32:01.072 --> 01:32:02.783
Yeah, and what's that?

813
01:32:04.075 --> 01:32:05.577
Just...

814
01:32:08.413 --> 01:32:10.874
...do for others
more than you do for yourself.

815
01:32:13.877 --> 01:32:16.296
That's what I got from it, anyway.

816
01:33:03.093 --> 01:33:04.845
You smell that?

817
01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:09.224
-What?
-In the air? Salt?

818
01:33:13.687 --> 01:33:15.856
We're getting close to the ocean.

819
01:34:15.081 --> 01:34:16.666
That's it.

820
01:34:18.668 --> 01:34:20.295
That's it.

821
01:34:53.036 --> 01:34:55.163
Get the engineer.

822
01:36:26.796 --> 01:36:28.256
That's far enough!

823
01:36:29.674 --> 01:36:32.093
What's your business here?

824
01:36:33.303 --> 01:36:35.513
My name is Eli.

825
01:36:35.764 --> 01:36:38.475
I have a King James Bible
in my possession.

826
01:36:38.641 --> 01:36:40.101
Remain where you are.

827
01:36:40.226 --> 01:36:44.314
Don't attempt to make any sudden moves,
or you will be fired upon.

828
01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:05.585
Be careful with it. Be careful.

829
01:37:11.382 --> 01:37:13.301
Careful with it.

830
01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:24.729
They're clean.

831
01:37:25.855 --> 01:37:29.484
We've been doing this
for a long time now.

832
01:37:30.777 --> 01:37:31.945
Feels like a museum.

833
01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:34.489
Oh, no,
it's much more than that.

834
01:37:34.656 --> 01:37:37.951
This is where we're going to start again.

835
01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:41.454
We've got a printing press.
It'll be operational quite soon.

836
01:37:42.038 --> 01:37:45.416
We're gonna teach people
about the world they lost.

837
01:37:45.583 --> 01:37:47.710
Help them start to rebuild it.

838
01:37:47.836 --> 01:37:52.382
I mean, look. Shakespeare.
Britannica, missing only a few volumes.

839
01:37:52.549 --> 01:37:55.885
There's a whole series of beautiful
Mozart and Wagner records...

840
01:37:56.302 --> 01:37:59.848
...in still very pristine condition.
But never a Bible.

841
01:38:00.014 --> 01:38:01.558
Well, not until now.

842
01:38:02.392 --> 01:38:05.645
Well, may I ask,
what condition it's in?

843
01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.690
It's beat up.

844
01:38:09.399 --> 01:38:11.276
But it will do the job.

845
01:38:12.068 --> 01:38:13.588
Do you think I could see it?

846
01:38:14.195 --> 01:38:15.947
Yes, you may.

847
01:38:22.745 --> 01:38:24.247
-Is that...?
-That's it. It's open.

848
01:38:24.414 --> 01:38:25.874
Is it?

849
01:38:59.949 --> 01:39:01.367
You have anything to write on?

850
01:39:01.534 --> 01:39:05.038
Could you get us
some writing paper, please?

851
01:39:05.205 --> 01:39:06.956
And a lot of it.

852
01:39:08.374 --> 01:39:10.376
A whole lot of it.

853
01:39:11.002 --> 01:39:13.087
It can't be.

854
01:39:14.047 --> 01:39:15.506
It can't...

855
01:39:20.261 --> 01:39:22.597
It's impossible!

856
01:39:23.514 --> 01:39:25.600
It can't be!

857
01:39:28.144 --> 01:39:30.104
Pay close attention...

858
01:39:30.271 --> 01:39:35.652
...and write down everything I say...

859
01:39:36.486 --> 01:39:40.114
...exactly as I say it.

860
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:46.454
The first book of Moses...

861
01:39:49.082 --> 01:39:51.251
...called Genesis.

862
01:39:51.542 --> 01:39:55.672
Chapter 1, verse 1.

863
01:39:58.466 --> 01:40:00.468
In the beginning...

864
01:40:01.594 --> 01:40:04.389
...God created the heavens...

865
01:40:05.765 --> 01:40:07.767
...and the earth.

866
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:12.939
Verse 2.

867
01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:19.821
And the earth was without form...

868
01:40:22.073 --> 01:40:23.950
...and void.

869
01:40:28.121 --> 01:40:30.206
And darkness...

870
01:40:31.958 --> 01:40:35.837
...was upon the face of the deep.

871
01:40:38.506 --> 01:40:40.925
And the spirit of God...

872
01:40:42.677 --> 01:40:44.595
...was hovering...

873
01:40:47.015 --> 01:40:49.726
...over the face of the waters.

874
01:40:53.104 --> 01:40:54.981
Verse 3.

875
01:40:58.109 --> 01:41:00.403
And God said:

876
01:41:03.948 --> 01:41:06.034
"Let there be light."

877
01:41:10.955 --> 01:41:13.041
And there was light.

878
01:41:23.676 --> 01:41:25.345
Where is Solara?

879
01:41:28.931 --> 01:41:30.767
Out there.

880
01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.353
Her choice.

881
01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:36.064
I tried to bring her back.

882
01:41:36.272 --> 01:41:38.566
She refused.

883
01:41:41.903 --> 01:41:43.571
What did you do when she refused?

884
01:41:50.661 --> 01:41:52.830
-Read it.
-What did you do to my daughter?

885
01:41:52.997 --> 01:41:56.959
-Read it!
-What did you do to my daughter?

886
01:42:14.185 --> 01:42:17.021
You can start anytime.

887
01:42:24.904 --> 01:42:26.697
I'm sorry.

888
01:42:28.825 --> 01:42:31.202
It's been so long, I don't remember.

889
01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:41.838
-You have to.
-Do I have to? Really?

890
01:42:42.004 --> 01:42:44.048
No, no, no. You have to. Please.

891
01:42:48.094 --> 01:42:49.637
Your leg.

892
01:42:50.721 --> 01:42:53.391
It doesn't hurt anymore.

893
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:56.436
I can smell it.

894
01:43:10.825 --> 01:43:13.870
You worked so hard for that book.

895
01:43:14.745 --> 01:43:18.082
You sacrificed so much, so many men.

896
01:43:19.959 --> 01:43:22.295
More than you could spare.

897
01:43:23.963 --> 01:43:28.009
Now, all those people who were
too scared to even say your name...

898
01:43:28.134 --> 01:43:30.386
...they're downstairs,
tearing up the bar right now.

899
01:43:30.595 --> 01:43:32.305
Did you know that?

900
01:43:32.972 --> 01:43:35.725
And there's no one there to stop them.

901
01:43:36.893 --> 01:43:39.479
And you're feverish.

902
01:43:41.772 --> 01:43:45.151
I can't imagine what it must feel like
to have what you want so close...

903
01:43:45.318 --> 01:43:47.361
...and it might as well be
a million miles away.

904
01:43:47.528 --> 01:43:48.905
Stop it!

905
01:43:52.366 --> 01:43:54.327
Are you leaving me?

906
01:43:56.829 --> 01:43:58.539
Claudia?

907
01:44:00.625 --> 01:44:02.543
Claudia!

908
01:44:05.463 --> 01:44:07.256
Claudia!

909
01:45:55.573 --> 01:45:59.994
<i>Dear Lord, thank you for giving me
the strength and the conviction...</i>

910
01:46:00.161 --> 01:46:03.164
<i>...to complete the task you entrusted to me.</i>

911
01:46:27.605 --> 01:46:33.486
<i>Thank you for guiding me straight and true
through the many obstacles in my path.</i>

912
01:46:39.367 --> 01:46:42.953
<i>And for keeping me resolute
when all around seemed lost.</i>

913
01:46:43.829 --> 01:46:48.250
<i>Thank you for your protection
and for your many signs along the way.</i>

914
01:46:49.502 --> 01:46:51.545
<i>Thank you for any good
that I may have done.</i>

915
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.049
<i>I'm so sorry about the bad.</i>

916
01:46:56.217 --> 01:46:59.387
You don't have to leave, you know.
You're very welcome to stay here.

917
01:46:59.553 --> 01:47:01.722
You'll be perfectly safe.

918
01:47:01.889 --> 01:47:03.516
Thank you.

919
01:47:03.974 --> 01:47:06.143
But this is something that I have to do.

920
01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:12.942
Where will you go?

921
01:47:14.318 --> 01:47:15.736
Home.

922
01:47:21.659 --> 01:47:24.036
<i>Thank you for the friend I made.</i>

923
01:47:24.203 --> 01:47:27.665
<i>Please watch over her
as you watched over me.</i>

924
01:47:48.519 --> 01:47:51.856
<i>Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.</i>

925
01:47:52.064 --> 01:47:54.358
<i>I'm so very tired.</i>

926
01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:58.362
<i>But I go now to my rest at peace...</i>

927
01:47:58.529 --> 01:48:02.533
<i>...knowing that I have done right
with my time on this earth.</i>

928
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:13.419
<i>I fought the good fight.</i>

929
01:48:13.961 --> 01:48:16.255
<i>I finished the race.</i>

930
01:48:19.216 --> 01:48:21.385
<i>I kept the faith.</i>

931
01:57:33.557 --> 01:57:35.558
