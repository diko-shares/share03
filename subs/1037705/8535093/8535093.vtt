718

tore a hole in the sky.

719

-You've probably heard the stories.
-Yeah.

720

trying to find a place to survive.

728

It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

730
01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:58.233
Like it was coming from inside of me.

731
01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:03.196

as I can hear you talking to me now.

733
01:09:06.157 --> 01:09:07.909
It led me.

734
01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.912
To a place where I found the book...

735
01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:14.416
...buried under some rubble.

736
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.756
The voice told me
to carry the book out west.

737
01:09:22.757 --> 01:09:26.428
Told me that a path
would be laid out for me...

738
01:09:26.594 --> 01:09:31.975
...that I'd be led to a place
where the book was safe.

739
01:09:34.769 --> 01:09:37.105
Told me that I'd be protected...

740
01:09:38.356 --> 01:09:41.943
...against anyone or anything
that stood in my path.

741

in your head told you to?

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.049
<i>I'm so sorry about the bad.</i>

1069
01:46:56.217 --> 01:46:59.387
You don't have to leave, you know.
You're very welcome to stay here.

1070
01:46:59.553 --> 01:47:01.722
You'll be perfectly safe.

1071
01:47:01.889 --> 01:47:03.516
Thank you.

1072
01:47:03.974 --> 01:47:06.143
But this is something that I have to do.

1073
01:47:11.357 --> 01:47:12.942
LOMBARDI: Where will you go?

1074
01:47:14.318 --> 01:47:15.736
Home.

1075
01:47:21.659 --> 01:47:24.036
ELI: <i>Thank you for the friend I made.</i>

1076
01:47:24.203 --> 01:47:27.665
<i>Please watch over her
as you watched over me.</i>

1077
01:47:48.519 --> 01:47:51.856
<i>Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.</i>

1078
01:47:52.064 --> 01:47:54.358
<i>I'm so very tired.</i>

1079
01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:58.362
<i>But I go now to my rest at peace...</i>

1080
01:47:58.529 --> 01:48:02.533
<i>...knowing that I have done right
with my time on this earth.</i>

1081
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:13.419
<i>I fought the good fight.</i>

1082
01:48:13.961 --> 01:48:16.255
<i>I finished the race.</i>

1083
01:48:19.216 --> 01:48:21.385
<i>I kept the faith.</i>
