00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.023
[crowd cheering]

2
00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.811
[panting]

3
00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:42.520
Man, get up.

4
00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:43.217
Get up!

5
00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:12.072
[grunts]

6
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.219
[Apollo]
That's not the way to do it.

7
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.354
Apollo?

8
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.139
Right.

9
00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.576
What are you doin' here?

10
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.186
Business.

11
00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:27.321
If the papers knew
we were talkin' like this,

12
00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:28.713
they'd think we was crazy.

13
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.760
Why you?

14
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:33.979
'Cause I'm the best, and you need
somebody to teach you different.

15
00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.808
I don't need this no more.
I...

16
00:02:38.027 --> 00:02:39.202
I don't want this no more.

17
00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:42.162
[Apollo] Look, man.

18
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:43.641
When you beat me,

19
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:46.427
I hurt all over.

20
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.342
I didn't wanna know
from nothin' or nobody,

21
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:50.213
not even my kids.

22
00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:52.476
Hell, every fighter
knows that hurt,

23
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.565
and we get sick inside
trying to live with it,

24
00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.088
so don't back off now.

25
00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:58.178
Make it right for yourself
or you'll be sorry you didn't.

26
00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:00.441
Now, when we fought,

27
00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:05.141
you had the eye of the tiger, man.
The edge!

28
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.708
And now you gotta get back,

29
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.797
and the way to get it back
is to go back to the beginning.

30
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.972
You know what I mean?

31
00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:12.148
[chuckles]

32
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.019
Maybe we can
win it back together.

33
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.198
Eye of the tiger, man.

34
00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:20.939
[crowd] Rocky! Rocky!

35
00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:22.289
Get it back, man.

36
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:24.204
[crowd] Rocky! Rocky!

37
00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:27.381
Come on! Come on, Balboa.
Come on!

38
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.818
Come on, get those feet moving.
Get your hands up. Come on, Rock!

39
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.170
Ooh! That right hand
hurt Rocky again!

40
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.041
A right! Another right!
A right! Another right!

41
00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:38.653
And down goes Balboa again.

42
00:03:38.696 --> 00:03:39.784
[referee] Four.

43
00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:41.264
Stop the fight.

44
00:03:41.308 --> 00:03:43.658
-You better stay down.
-[referee] Six.

45
00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:45.747
I got some more.
I got some more for you, so get up.

46
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.749
I got a lot of moves.
I got a lot of moves. Come on.

47
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.229
[commentator] Here we go again.
Clubber coming into him.

48
00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:55.017
You ain't so bad.
You ain't so bad.

49
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.106
You ain't so bad. Come on.

50
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.282
You ain't so bad.
You ain't nothin'!

51
00:03:59.326 --> 00:04:01.110
-You must be crazy or something!
-I'm crazy?

52
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:02.459
-You're just a stupid fool!
-Yeah, I may be...

53
00:04:02.503 --> 00:04:03.895
-You're crazy.
-...but I ain't breathing heavy.

54
00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.070
He's a fool.
He's stupid.

55
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.726
How could he come back
from a beating like that?

56
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.988
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

57
00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:11.076
What the hell are you doing?

58
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.339
I know what I'm doing.

59
00:04:12.382 --> 00:04:13.514
No, you don't know
what you're doing!

60
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.298
He's gotta come to you.
You're the champ.

61
00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:16.256
He's nothing.

62
00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.257
He's mine.

63
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.042
-Don't...
-He's getting tired.

64
00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:22.174
Don't go wasting your punches.

65
00:04:22.218 --> 00:04:24.089
I know what I'm doing, I swear.
I know what I'm doing.

66
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:25.395
Go out there and do it, Rock.

67
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:26.570
Eye of the tiger.
You understand?

68
00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.224
Yeah.

69
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.791
Go out there
and knock his head off.

70
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.488
He's just a man, Rock.
He's just a man. All right?

71
00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:34.186
Be more man than him!

72
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.362
Go get him.
Eye of the tiger!

73
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:36.363
Eye of the tiger!

74
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.323
[commentator] All right,
this is the beginning of round three.

75
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.325
Tough rounds
to call right now.

76
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.763
-Come on. Come on.
-Come on.

77
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.246
And Rocky throws him three
rights to the head and a left.

78
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.292
He is back.
He's your heavyweight.

79
00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:55.338
Stick him!

80
00:04:59.168 --> 00:05:00.125
Get in there!

81
00:05:01.562 --> 00:05:02.345
Come on! Come on!

82
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:04.956
He's getting killed.

83
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.176
Oh, no, no, no. He's not getting
killed, he's getting mad!

84
00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:10.701
My mother hits
harder than that. Come on.

85
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:12.790
A little harder. A little harder, champ.
In the face. Come on.

86
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:16.272
Again, come on, champ.
You ain't so bad!

87
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.099
You ain't nothing.

88
00:05:18.883 --> 00:05:20.145
Rocky!

89
00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.496
Rocky! Rocky!

90
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:30.286
-[commentator] You see how
he drew him in? -Right.

91
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.766
Now Rocky's
throwing the punches.

92
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:32.462
Look at the punches.

93
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:43.125
[thudding]

94
00:05:43.168 --> 00:05:45.432
[indistinct commentary]

95
00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:53.396
Yeah!

96
00:05:58.053 --> 00:05:59.663
Rocky! Rocky!

97
00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:01.012
Come on. Come on.

98
00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:01.839
Come on!

99
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.493
Come on.

100
00:06:04.973 --> 00:06:06.453
Rocky! Rocky!

101
00:06:06.496 --> 00:06:07.628
Come on. Come on!

102
00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:17.899
Yeah!

103
00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:18.595
[referee] You're out!

104
00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:23.557
Yeah!

105
00:06:28.692 --> 00:06:34.394
[commentator] There he is, the new heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

106
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:37.048
Rocky is exhausted!

107
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.661
We did it!

108
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:45.840
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner by knockout...

109
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.146
Are you all right?

110
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.278
Never better.

111
00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:51.672
Never better.

112
00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:54.631
[announcer] Once again the
heavyweight champion of the world,

113
00:06:54.675 --> 00:07:00.202
the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa.

114
00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:32.930
[man on tv] Today may have proved
to be a landmark in sports history.

115
00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:35.150
-After unraveling years of red tape...
-Come on!

116
00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:37.326
...Russia will now throw
its hat into the ring.

117
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:39.197
The prize ring, that is.

118
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.896
The introductions were made by his
wife, Ludmilla Vobet Drago

119
00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:44.246
She was the double
gold medalist in swimming.

120
00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:48.206
Today, the Soviet Union has officially
entered professional boxing.

121
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.341
My husband and great undefeated
heavyweight world amateur champion,

122
00:07:52.384 --> 00:07:54.125
Captain Ivan Drago,

123
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:56.693
has come here
with his trainers to America

124
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:59.348
to compete
as an international sportsman

125
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:00.958
and ambassador of goodwill.

126
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:04.353
If possible, we would like
to have an exhibition bout

127
00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:06.616
with your great champion
Rocky Balboa

128
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.750
as a way to introduce
Drago to America.

129
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:11.316
[man] Has Balboa responded?

130
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.275
[man 1] No,
he has not responded.

131
00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:15.190
Drago is still an amateur.

132
00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:17.192
[man] What makes you think
he can stand up the pressure

133
00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:21.196
of fighting someone as
seasoned and strong as Balboa?

134
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:24.634
Drago is the most perfectly
trained athlete in the world.

135
00:08:24.678 --> 00:08:27.115
There is no one who can match
his strength, his endurance,

136
00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:28.812
or his aggressiveness.

137
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:31.119
You make it sound
like he's indestructible.

138
00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:33.121
Yes, he is.

139
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:35.036
[man] Well,
can this mammoth Russian,

140
00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:37.255
who's already been nicknamed
the Siberian Express,

141
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.215
wreak havoc among the
professional heavyweight ranks?

142
00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:44.219
Whoever he fights first,
it'll be one hot ticket.

143
00:08:44.262 --> 00:08:49.050
We'll be right back with a check on
today's pro football sports scoreboard.

144
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:51.400
[Apollo] You know, those Russians are real
serious about their giant taking your title.

145
00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:52.836
You know that?

146
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.622
[Rocky] I've heard some talk.

147
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:57.711
It's a lot more than talk, Stallion.
A lot more than talk.

148
00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.452
They get to you?

149
00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:04.282
Well, they were talking
to the boxing commission

150
00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.720
about me and this guy putting
on this exhibition, you know.

151
00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:08.199
Yeah.

152
00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:09.200
What'd you say?

153
00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:11.725
I say, I don't know.

154
00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:13.944
Say, what'd you say?

155
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.818
-Say?
-Yeah, what'd you say?

156
00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:20.429
I said, "I don't know."

157
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:23.998
What you're saying is you really
don't wanna fight this Russian.

158
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.739
-That's what you're saying, right?
-No, no, no.

159
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:28.568
No. What I'm saying is,

160
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:32.093
why do it, you know,
until I have to?

161
00:09:32.136 --> 00:09:34.922
Well, you don't mind me beating up
on him a little bit now, do you?

162
00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:36.184
You what?

163
00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.664
Yeah. What?

164
00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:39.056
You think
I don't have it anymore?

165
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.493
You got nothing
more to prove, do you?

166
00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:43.539
Look, man, this is the
opportunity of a lifetime.

167
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.542
This isn't just another
boxing climb into the ropes.

168
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.632
This is a Russian propaganda
machine starting up.

169
00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:51.329
And they didn't miss a thing.
I mean, look,

170
00:09:51.373 --> 00:09:53.157
they had to try
to win the women over

171
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:54.637
by having this Russian's wife
running around and telling everybody

172
00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:57.553
what a great guy
this Drago is.

173
00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:01.252
Look, this is politics all the
way, Stallion. Politics.

174
00:10:01.296 --> 00:10:05.126
This is a chance to stand
face-to-face with their best. I mean,

175
00:10:05.169 --> 00:10:09.043
it'd be more important to the people
than ever. It'd be in the history books.

176
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:11.480
Right. You know, listen,
Adrian just cooked some dinner.

177
00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.525
Why don't we go up?
We'll eat, we'll talk about it.

178
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:14.657
She'd love to see you,
Apollo, really.

179
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:17.965
All right, yeah, you know...

180
00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:19.488
Never turn down
a great Italian meal, right?

181
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:21.708
-All right.
-Hut one, hut two.

182
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:29.672
My husband and I thank you for
coming to our training quarter today.

183
00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:31.718
As you can see,
it is highly advanced,

184
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:34.155
and we wish to show
the American press

185
00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:37.593
a small portion of the advances
our country's made

186
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.987
in the technology
of human performance.

187
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.729
[man] What does all this do
to enhance performance?

188
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:45.645
It makes a man a better man,

189
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:48.256
a great athlete,
a super athlete,

190
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:51.128
by harnessing
all of his strength.

191
00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:53.870
Though most of the world
is ignorant in body chemistry,

192
00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:57.613
we wish to educate
your country.

193
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.397
Shall we have a demonstration?

194
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:00.660
-Please do.
-Thank you.

195
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:14.499
As you can see,
Drago averages 1,850 pounds,

196
00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:16.153
so the result's
quite obvious.

197
00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:20.201
Whatever he hits,
he destroys.

198
00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:22.594
[Apollo] I've seen this Drago
fight when he was an amateur.

199
00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.771
He's big and he's strong,
but he's clumsy.

200
00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:26.163
I know I can beat him.

201
00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:31.212
-You can do your homework.
-Okay. Later, Dad.

202
00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:33.344
Later, Uncle Paulie.
Later, Apollo.

203
00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:36.478
-Later, big guy.
-See you later, kiddo.

204
00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:40.134
Don't you think people are expecting
to see Rocky whack this bum out first?

205
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:43.572
Yeah, and he will,
when it's for real.

206
00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.313
This is just an exhibition bout.
It's kids' stuff.

207
00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:47.271
What's the purpose?

208
00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:49.970
I mean, what at this point in your
life is worth getting hurt for?

209
00:11:50.013 --> 00:11:53.147
I don't want this chump to come over
here with all that hype, you know,

210
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.714
trying to make us look bad.

211
00:11:54.757 --> 00:11:55.889
They try every other way.

212
00:11:57.325 --> 00:11:58.805
I think it's wrong.

213
00:11:58.848 --> 00:12:00.981
No, it's never been
more right.

214
00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.591
It's not the middle ages

215
00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:05.768
when armies sent over their best
fighters to kill each other.

216
00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:07.944
We're supposed to be civilized.

217
00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:10.555
You're a great fighter,

218
00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:12.601
but you've been retired
for nearly five years.

219
00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:15.038
Don't you think it's time to start
thinking about something else?

220
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:18.215
I mean, how much can you take?
Either of you.

221
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.133
I'll get the coffee.

222
00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:28.008
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

223
00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:30.880
I just care about you both.
I...

224
00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:41.325
Just relax.
I'll be right back.

225
00:12:50.247 --> 00:12:51.858
You're not mad, are you?

226
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:53.381
No, I'm not mad.

227
00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:56.514
Just have a bad feeling.

228
00:12:56.558 --> 00:13:00.910
You know Apollo.
He's got this big imagination, you know.

229
00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:04.609
With Apollo, he needs to be loved.
He just can't stand being forgotten.

230
00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:07.482
I guess he's gonna
have to face up to it.

231
00:13:08.483 --> 00:13:09.353
So do you.

232
00:13:11.007 --> 00:13:11.878
Yeah, I know.

233
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.883
All this won't happen
if you don't back it.

234
00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:19.711
Apollo, he thinks he's fighting
for the whole country

235
00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:22.671
but his reasons are wrong.

236
00:13:22.714 --> 00:13:26.675
It's... It's like
a bad publicity stunt.

237
00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:29.199
I don't want you getting upset.
You're not upset, are you?

238
00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:32.333
-I'm not upset.
-You sure? You're okay?

239
00:13:32.376 --> 00:13:33.508
-You sure?
-Sure.

240
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:34.509
Wanna go a few rounds
at the bag?

241
00:13:35.858 --> 00:13:37.294
-Okay.
-Whoa! Champ!

242
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.644
-Thank you.
-No problem.

243
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.087
-[Rocky grunts]
-[Apollo chuckles]

244
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.697
[Apollo] Now,
this was a great fight.

245
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.654
[Rocky]
Yeah, this was great.

246
00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:53.920
Mamma mia! What you using
for a chin there, Stallion?

247
00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:55.835
[both laughing]

248
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.271
I should have slipped that one.

249
00:13:57.314 --> 00:13:58.881
Yeah, you definitely
should have slipped that one.

250
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.667
Ain't it something, Stallion?

251
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.931
It's crazy how people, they just care
about you when you're in that ring

252
00:14:04.974 --> 00:14:06.193
and they care about you
when you're bleeding,

253
00:14:06.236 --> 00:14:07.672
but once you step out
of that ring, Stallion,

254
00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:09.065
it's like you're
ancient history.

255
00:14:09.109 --> 00:14:10.632
Can I ask you something?

256
00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.417
What?

257
00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:16.072
Well, you know, this fight you're
having against the Russian...

258
00:14:16.116 --> 00:14:18.858
Do you think maybe
it ain't against him?

259
00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:23.863
Well, do you think maybe it's,
like, you against you?

260
00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:25.777
What do you think?

261
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.692
I don't think
I want to hear this, Stallion.

262
00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:29.694
Come on.
Hey, Apollo, look,

263
00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:31.609
you were a great fighter,
no doubt about that,

264
00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:34.612
but, look,
we gotta face the facts, too.

265
00:14:34.656 --> 00:14:37.398
You don't want to believe it,
but maybe the show is over.

266
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:39.922
Man, that's easy for you to say.
You're still on top.

267
00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:42.620
Let's face it,
we gotta change sometime.

268
00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:45.188
I don't want to change, man.
I like who I am.

269
00:14:45.232 --> 00:14:46.929
But look at that, you know?

270
00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.104
You don't want to believe this,

271
00:14:48.148 --> 00:14:49.976
but that ain't us up there
no more, Apollo.

272
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:52.152
We can't do that the way
we did it before.

273
00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:53.544
We're changing.

274
00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:55.982
Maybe you think
you're changing,

275
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:58.245
but you can't change
what you really are.

276
00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:01.291
And you can forget all this money and
stuff you got all around you, man,

277
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.336
'cause it don't
change a thing.

278
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.732
You and me,
we don't even have a choice.

279
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:09.299
See, we're born
with a killer instinct

280
00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:12.172
that you can't just turn
off and on like some radio.

281
00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:15.740
We have to be right
in the middle of the action

282
00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:17.220
'cause we're the warriors.

283
00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:18.961
And without some challenge,

284
00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:20.397
without some damn war to fight,

285
00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:22.269
then the warrior
may as well be dead, Stallion.

286
00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:28.144
All right? So...

287
00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:30.930
So I'm asking you,

288
00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:33.628
as a friend,

289
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.375
stand in my corner
just this one last time.

290
00:15:47.033 --> 00:15:48.556
[reporter] Apollo,
what made you decide

291
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:49.992
to put on an exhibition fight
with Drago?

292
00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:50.993
[Apollo] Let's call it
a sense of responsibility.

293
00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:53.343
[reporter 1]
Responsibility how?

294
00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:56.564
[Apollo] I had to teach this young
fellow to box, American style.

295
00:15:56.607 --> 00:16:00.307
Apollo, isn't Drago a little
inexperienced to be in the same ring?

296
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.919
Well, you know,
some folks got to learn the hard way.

297
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.877
So, no quick
knockout prediction?

298
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:08.141
No, no, no.
I'm not mad at him.

299
00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:10.056
I just want to show
the whole world

300
00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:11.927
that Russia doesn't have
all the best athletes.

301
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.016
[reporter 2] Rocky, aren't you
helping to train Apollo?

302
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.845
Well, yeah, I'm gonna try
if he'll listen.

303
00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:18.803
Wait a minute.
What do you mean "listen," Stallion?

304
00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:20.718
It is hard to get a word in--

305
00:16:20.762 --> 00:16:22.242
-Oh, come on.
-It's hard.

306
00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:23.808
Come on, man. My man.

307
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:25.854
[crowd laughing]

308
00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:27.377
-[reporter 3] Rocky.
-Yeah.

309
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.205
How do you think
Apollo should fight Drago?

310
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:30.293
How?

311
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:32.339
Well, personally,

312
00:16:32.382 --> 00:16:35.037
I think you're gonna need
a very big ladder.

313
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:37.997
Drago, how does it feel to spar
with the great former champion?

314
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.958
The man's tongue didn't come
through customs.

315
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.220
[crowd laughing]

316
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.703
You don't really think
you gonna whip me, do you, huh?

317
00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:55.797
I did not come here to lose.

318
00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:01.063
So no quick
knockout prediction.

319
00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:02.456
Excuse, please.

320
00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:05.111
You are not very realistic,
are you, Mr. Creed?

321
00:17:05.154 --> 00:17:07.287
Where did you come from?
What are you talking about?

322
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.550
You can box, yes,
but you are far too old

323
00:17:09.593 --> 00:17:10.899
to think that
you can win over Drago.

324
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:12.031
Is that a fact?

325
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:13.902
And it could be a painful one.

326
00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.209
You put that heavy bag with
eyeballs in the ring with me,

327
00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:17.688
and you're gonna
see the meaning of pain.

328
00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:19.255
Why do you insult us?

329
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.083
Don't make me
out to be the bad guy.

330
00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:22.998
I came here to talk about
a friendly exhibition bout

331
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.869
till Comrade Big Mouth
started up.

332
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:27.394
It is you who are the aggressor.
This is obvious.

333
00:17:27.437 --> 00:17:30.136
I wish to say to the press,
in all fairness,

334
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:32.312
Drago should not even
fight this man,

335
00:17:32.355 --> 00:17:34.183
because the truth is,
he is a has-been.

336
00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:39.319
To defeat him is an accomplishment
not worthy of Drago.

337
00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:43.366
But to fight the real champion,
this means something.

338
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.065
You get that big chump
in the ring right now,

339
00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:47.631
and I'm gonna
show you what I have.

340
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:48.241
[clamoring]

341
00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:50.199
Bring it on!

342
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:55.335
I don't want to hear her.

An exhibition!

520
00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:50.930
[commentator 1] A tremendous end
to the first round by the Russian,

521
00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:54.542
and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

522
00:27:54.585 --> 00:27:56.675
[commentator 2] The Soviet's
strength is incredible!

523
00:28:00.766 --> 00:28:02.637
Champ, look,
I gotta stop it.

524
00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:04.595
Don't you dare
stop this fight.

525
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:07.511
Man, don't do this to me.

526
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:09.426
I'm doing this for me.

527
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.300
I'm here to fight.
Don't you stop this fight.

528
00:28:13.343 --> 00:28:16.956
Boy, I'll tell you something, that was
a pulverizing round for the ex-champion.

529
00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:20.307
Hey, folks, Ivan Drago
is definitely for real.

530
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.396
[crowd chanting]
Apollo! Apollo!

531
00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:26.661
If you're my friend,
don't you stop this fight.

532
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:30.186
-[crowd] Apollo! Apollo!
-No matter what.

533
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:35.191
[crowd] Apollo! Apollo!
Apollo! Apollo!

534
00:28:41.197 --> 00:28:43.330
[bell rings]

535
00:28:43.373 --> 00:28:45.158
[commentator 1] Creed now
comes out for round two.

536
00:28:48.422 --> 00:28:51.033
The Russian's trying
to intimidate Creed.

537
00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:52.208
Come on, pull it together!

538
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:10.357
[commentator 2] And the Russian throws
a right hand and staggers Creed!

539
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.794
Another right to the jaw!
Another right to the head!

540
00:29:12.838 --> 00:29:14.796
Time up now! Time up!

541
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.368
Stop the fight!

542
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:22.804
[commentator 1]
The referee tries to step in,

543
00:29:22.848 --> 00:29:24.371
and he's thrown
across the ring.

544
00:29:24.414 --> 00:29:26.112
Throw the towel!
Throw the towel!

545
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.380
Apollo!

546
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:43.782
Apollo!

547
00:29:45.261 --> 00:29:46.219
Apollo!

548
00:29:46.262 --> 00:29:47.220
[commentator 1]
Creed is down!

549
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:53.661
[commentator 2] Apollo is down,
and he could be badly hurt.

550
00:29:53.704 --> 00:29:54.880
[Rocky]
Let him breathe!

551
00:29:54.923 --> 00:29:57.491
-Move back!
-Get these guys out of here.

552
00:29:57.534 --> 00:29:59.667
The winner, Ivan Drago.

553
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.843
Let me through! Apollo!

554
00:30:01.887 --> 00:30:03.584
I cannot be defeated.

555
00:30:03.627 --> 00:30:05.412
Somebody get a doctor in here!

556
00:30:05.455 --> 00:30:08.545
Soon, I defeat real champion.

557
00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:09.895
-Stand back.
-Will you let him breathe?

558
00:30:09.938 --> 00:30:11.418
Come on, Apollo.

559
00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:15.901
Soon, whole world
will know my name.

560
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:18.381
Drago.

561
00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:23.865
Drago.

562
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:31.481
What started out as a joke has
turned out to be a disaster.

563
00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:33.919
If he dies, he dies.

564
00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:45.060
[pastor] Men are made for
the end in the beginning.

565
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.411
Apollo Creed was a warrior.

566
00:30:49.717 --> 00:30:52.894
He lived and he died
by the code of a warrior.

567
00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:58.291
A warrior has the right
to choose his way of life

568
00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:00.859
and his way of death.

569
00:31:02.425 --> 00:31:09.345
And we are bound
to respect this sacred right.

570
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:11.957
In this life we live,

571
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.482
there's always the possibility
of holy intrusion.

572
00:31:15.525 --> 00:31:18.311
And so it was that Apollo
came to know

573
00:31:18.354 --> 00:31:22.097
that none of his successors
had come close

574
00:31:22.141 --> 00:31:27.146
to satisfying the questions
he had inside.

575
00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:31.672
He gave his life
to know those answers.

576
00:31:41.682 --> 00:31:45.904
I owe everything I got

577
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:50.909
and my family has got

578
00:31:52.214 --> 00:31:53.128
to you.

579
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:02.703
[voice shaking]
You gave me a break

580
00:32:05.488 --> 00:32:06.794
when no one else would.

581
00:32:08.578 --> 00:32:10.102
You believed in me

582
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.148
when no one else would.

583
00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:16.978
I really loved you, man.

584
00:32:39.044 --> 00:32:40.523
I let it happen.

585
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:42.264
No, you didn't.

586
00:32:42.308 --> 00:32:44.179
It's no one's fault.

587
00:32:44.223 --> 00:32:45.964
You can't put
all that blame on yourself.

588
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:48.879
He was your friend.

589
00:32:48.923 --> 00:32:50.794
You would have done anything
to protect him.

590
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:51.970
You have to believe that.

591
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.072
[man] We've gone over these
facts many times, Mr. Balboa.

592
00:33:07.115 --> 00:33:08.856
The answer is still the same.

593
00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:10.379
Can't you change the rules?

594
00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:14.253
Under present federation rules,

595
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:17.473
any fight between
you and this Russian

596
00:33:17.517 --> 00:33:19.562
cannot,
nor will it be allowed.

597
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:23.392
Let's be realistic.

598
00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:29.877
The Russian, he has not yet had
one legitimate professional fight.

599
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:34.882
The bout he had with Creed
was a publicity stunt

600
00:33:35.883 --> 00:33:37.885
that backfired!

601
00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:41.671
What you guys are really saying is you
don't think I have a chance, do you?

602
00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:46.198
Come on. What we're trying to say
is, why tempt fate?

603
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:47.895
Let's find out
more about this man.

604
00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:50.854
Let's see what develops.

605
00:33:50.898 --> 00:33:55.207
He's had one professional
fight, and one man is dead.

606
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.688
But if it prevents
another fatality,

607
00:33:58.732 --> 00:34:00.690
-it's well worth it.
-Of course.

608
00:34:00.734 --> 00:34:03.650
Best way to a boxing ban
is one more accident.

609
00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:05.956
Especially at this magnitude.

610
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.307
Do you realize what kind of
a magnitude this is?

611
00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:11.005
Excuse me.

612
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.442
Do you wanna know
what the bottom line is?

613
00:34:13.486 --> 00:34:14.835
You got rules.

614
00:34:14.878 --> 00:34:17.359
We've got rules.

615
00:34:17.403 --> 00:34:19.666
Everybody's got to
abide by those rules.

616
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:27.891
-[woman] Rocky, is the decision final?
-[Rocky] Yes.

617
00:34:29.154 --> 00:34:30.851
[man] Rocky, over here, please.

618
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.071
Is this the first time the
champion has given up his crown?

619
00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:34.637
[Rocky]
I don't know about that.

620
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:36.900
[man 1] Doesn't the title
mean anything to you anymore?

621
00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:38.250
[Rocky]
Not until this is over.

622
00:34:38.293 --> 00:34:39.947
[woman] Look, we know
you've agreed to fight,

623
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:42.036
but don't you think you're
moving a little too quickly?

624
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.559
Drago's ready now.

625
00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:46.345
[man 2] Drago, what does
this fight mean to you?

626
00:34:46.388 --> 00:34:47.650
Do you have
any feelings on it?

627
00:34:49.348 --> 00:34:51.393
No.

628
00:34:51.437 --> 00:34:54.092
Drago has told me that
this will be an easy fight.

629
00:34:54.135 --> 00:34:56.137
Can't Drago
speak for himself?

630
00:34:56.181 --> 00:34:57.138
Yes.

631
00:34:57.704 --> 00:34:59.140
Yes, well?

632
00:34:59.184 --> 00:35:03.492
It's a matter of science
and evolution.

633
00:35:03.536 --> 00:35:04.885
Isn't it, gentlemen?

634
00:35:05.668 --> 00:35:07.844
Drago is 13 years younger,

635
00:35:07.888 --> 00:35:10.978
and the most perfectly
trained fighter ever.

636
00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:13.198
This other man
has not the size,

637
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:16.636
or the endurance,
or the genetics to win.

638
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:20.030
It's physically impossible
for this little man to win.

639
00:35:22.163 --> 00:35:25.732
Drago is a look at the future.

640
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.560
Has the fight date
been set yet?

641
00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:29.170
December 25th.

642
00:35:29.214 --> 00:35:31.564
-[man] Why Christmas?
-[Rocky] That's what I was told.

643
00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:33.174
[woman] Where?

644
00:35:33.218 --> 00:35:35.220
-It's in Russia.
-Are you nuts?

645
00:35:35.263 --> 00:35:36.612
Why did you agree to this?

646
00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:39.180
We fight in Soviet Union,
or we fight nowhere.

647
00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:45.447
This country could never
judge a fight fair.

648
00:35:45.491 --> 00:35:47.580
What makes you say
he's not being treated fairly?

649
00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:49.625
It is more lies
and false propaganda

650
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:53.716
to support this antagonistic
and violent government!

651
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.849
Oh! Violent?

652
00:35:55.892 --> 00:35:59.026
Hey, we don't keep our people
behind a wall with machine guns!

653
00:35:59.069 --> 00:36:01.594
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

654
00:36:01.637 --> 00:36:04.249
I'm the unsilent majority,
big mouth!

655
00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:07.861
Good! Yes, good!
Insult us!

656
00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:11.473
Is more typical rude behavior
toward visiting foreigners.

657
00:36:11.517 --> 00:36:14.084
But perhaps this simple defeat

658
00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:16.478
of this little
so-called champion

659
00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:19.829
will be a perfect example
of how pathetically weak

660
00:36:19.873 --> 00:36:21.962
your society has become!

661
00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:23.181
We go!

662
00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:34.583
[man] Rocky, over here.

663
00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:36.281
Rocky, can you
tell us about a...

664
00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:42.200
[reporters] Mrs.
Balboa! Mrs. Balboa!

665
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:44.680
How do you feel
about going to Russia?

666
00:36:44.724 --> 00:36:46.247
Is your husband
going to Moscow?

667
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:49.337
-[reporter] Mrs. Balboa!
-Adrian! Adrian!

668
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:51.861
Mrs. Balboa, did Creed's death
make up your husband's mind?

669
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:53.820
I don't know
what you're talking about!

670
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:55.952
When will you be
going to Russia?

671
00:36:55.996 --> 00:36:59.347
Look, I'm not going to Russia.
I don't know what you're talking about.

672
00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:02.785
I don't know why you're here. I don't
know what you people are doing here!

673
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:04.222
-[reporter 1] Mrs. Balboa!
-[reporter 2] Was it his decision?

674
00:37:29.943 --> 00:37:32.119
-Rocky?
-Yeah?

675
00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:37.385
You all right?

676
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:40.040
Yeah. Fine.

677
00:37:41.302 --> 00:37:42.390
Why'd you do it?

678
00:37:46.307 --> 00:37:48.222
I just gotta do
what I gotta do.

679
00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:49.745
You don't have to do anything.

680
00:37:53.488 --> 00:37:55.185
No, Adrian, I do, and...

681
00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:59.973
I gotta leave this place, too.

682
00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:02.367
So where are you going?

683
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.717
They said they're going to
let me train in Russia, and...

684
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:08.938
I just want to go
someplace where

685
00:38:08.982 --> 00:38:11.506
I ain't gonna think
about nothing except him.

686
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.379
Rocky, give it some time.

687
00:38:14.422 --> 00:38:17.817
Don't do this.
A lot of people live with hurt.

688
00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.820
Adrian, a lot of people
don't have a choice. I do.

689
00:38:20.863 --> 00:38:23.475
And for that, you're willing
to lose everything?

690
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.743
There's a lot more

00:58:08.963 --> 00:58:10.269
I missed you.

866
00:58:12.401 --> 00:58:14.752
I'm with you, no matter what.

867
00:58:37.775 --> 00:58:39.559
[rock music playing]

868
00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:22.907
[grunting]

869
00:59:43.362 --> 00:59:45.059
[grunting]

870
00:59:56.984 --> 00:59:57.985
No pain.

871
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.947
No pain. No pain.

872
01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:43.640
Go on, pick it up.

873
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:45.642
Pick it up, come on.

874
01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:50.821
Come on, push!

875
01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:55.477
-Come on! Come on! Push it up!
-[Rocky grunting]

876
01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.487
Drago!

877
01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.931
[panting]

878
01:02:06.374 --> 01:02:08.507
[grunting]

879
01:02:31.138 --> 01:02:34.925
Drago!

880
01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:40.017
Drago!

881
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.544
Drago!

882
01:02:49.809 --> 01:02:52.638
[commentator 1] Hello, everybody, and
Merry Christmas from a very unusual place.

883
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:55.075
We're in Moscow,
in the Soviet Union.

884
01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.338
I'm Barry Tompkins,
along with Al Bandiero,

885
01:02:57.382 --> 01:03:01.038
and this promises to be the
most-watched event in boxing history.

886
01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:03.649
The Iron Horse, from America,
Rocky Balboa.

887
01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:05.651
[speaking foreign language]

888
01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:09.437
Ivan Drago,

889
01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:12.832
since that tragedy in Las Vegas
and the death of Apollo Creed,

890
01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.792
he's been re-nicknamed
"Death from Above."

891
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.798
[crowd clapping and cheering]

892
01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:49.434
And high above us,
the general secretary of the Soviet

893
01:03:49.477 --> 01:03:50.870
and other members
of the Politburo

894
01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.916
have now made
their way to their seats

895
01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:55.005
high above the ring
here in Moscow.

896
01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:10.107
[Rocky] You don't know anything
about this guy you're fighting.

897
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.500
It's just some kind of exhibition fight.
This ain't gonna mean nothing.

898
01:04:14.415 --> 01:04:16.635
You may not understand
what I'm talking about now.

899
01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.158
I can appreciate that.

900
01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:19.899
But you will when it's over.
Believe me.

901
01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:22.859
You will when it's over.

902
01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.826
Yo, Rock, I know
you're kinda busy just now,

903
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.568
but I want to tell you
some things I never told you.

904
01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:40.180
I know sometimes I act stupid
and I say stupid things,

905
01:04:40.224 --> 01:04:41.529
but you kept me around

906
01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:43.618
when other people would have
said, "Drop that bum."

907
01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:45.490
You give me respect.

908
01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:47.840
You know, it's hard for me
to say these kind of things,

909
01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.016
because that ain't my way,

910
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.367
but if I could just unzip myself
and step out and be someone else,

911
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:54.151
I'd want to be you.

912
01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:56.762
You're all heart, Rock.

913
01:04:59.547 --> 01:05:00.722
Thanks, Paulie.

914
01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:04.074
Now, blast this
guy's teeth out.

915
01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:06.032
I'll try.

916
01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:18.001
[indistinct chatter]

917
01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:40.849
Right now,
one of the fighters

918
01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:43.765
is starting to make his way through
this crowd and toward the ring.

919
01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:45.332
Listen to this crowd!

920
01:05:45.376 --> 01:05:46.681
[commentator 1] We knew
he wouldn't be popular,

921
01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:48.074
but this borders
on pure hatred.

922
01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:04.221
Rocky's face,
absolutely like stone.

923
01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:06.745
He is the picture
of concentration,

924
01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:10.140
and the booing crowd here does
not seem to bother him one bit.

925
01:06:10.183 --> 01:06:13.230
The champ has a look tonight
that can burn through lead.

926
01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:15.884
What Rocky Balboa
really brings to this dance

927
01:06:15.928 --> 01:06:18.104
is a lot of heart
and a lot of determination,

928
01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.237
but then he gives away strength
and gives away size,

929
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.676
and maybe even more important,
he gives away age.

930
01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:28.897
It seems that the booing crowd has
absolutely no effect on the man.

931
01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:32.205
His concentration
seems to be like stone.

932
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:34.686
Listen to this crowd.
It sounds insane.

933
01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:38.733
The power of Ivan Drago is
virtually a biochemical product.

934
01:06:38.777 --> 01:06:42.868
The man is infinitely stronger than
Rocky Balboa, and a foot taller.

935
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:45.523
Every punch
is a lethal weapon.

936
01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:49.527
And now the entrance of the
Russian national champion,

937
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:53.400
Ivan Drago, a man with an
entire country in his corner.

938
01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:16.353
[commentator 1] Look at the
expression on the face of Ivan Drago.

939
01:08:16.396 --> 01:08:19.356
He seems impervious
to this madness of the crowd.

940
01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.880
He's like a volcano
just waiting to erupt.

941
01:08:24.796 --> 01:08:26.014
[commentator 2]
The Russian champion

942
01:08:26.058 --> 01:08:27.799
is amazingly cool,
ladies and gentlemen,

943
01:08:27.842 --> 01:08:29.583
as he acknowledges his premier.

944
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.728
[indistinct shouting]

945
01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:56.262
[crowd booing]

946
01:09:12.887 --> 01:09:14.976
[Russian national anthem
playing]

947
01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:28.267
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen...

948
01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:33.446
[speaking Russian]

949
01:10:36.362 --> 01:10:38.234
...Rocky Balboa!

950
01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:43.674
[commentator 1]
It's unbelievable.

951
01:10:43.717 --> 01:10:45.893
I have never, in all my years,
seen such a hostile crowd.

952
01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:52.291
[announcer speaking in Russian]

953
01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:57.644
...Ivan Drago!

954
01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:02.475
[crowd cheering]

955
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.308
[commentator 1] The two men are
walking toward the center of the ring.

956
01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:12.616
It's an unbelievable sight
to see.

957
01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:16.315
They're toe to toe.

958
01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.361
The Russian towers
above the American.

959
01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:21.625
It's a true case
of David and Goliath here.

960
01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:24.541
It's unbelievable,
the condition of both men,

961
01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:26.151
but the Russian champion...

962
01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:27.544
I must break you.

963
01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:37.249
Remember what I said back there
about wanting to be you?

964
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.076
Yeah.

965
01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:39.469
Forget it.

966
01:11:43.777 --> 01:11:45.736
[speaking Russian]

967
01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.783
-[man] Drago! Drago!
-Drago! Drago!

968
01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:50.915
Take it straight to him, now.

969
01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.399
[bell rings]

970
01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:57.835
There's the bell
for the opening round,

971
01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.706
and Rocky Balboa comes out
to the center of the ring.

972
01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:02.492
But the Russian, right back
into Balboa's corner now.

973
01:12:03.144 --> 01:12:04.537
[thudding]

974
01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:06.974
Come on, baby!

975
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.413
[Paulie] Spit him out, Rock!

976
01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:15.243
[commentator 1] Balboa
gets out of the corner now,

977
01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:18.943
and now once more it is Drago
backing Rocky Balboa up with a jab,

978
01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:22.381
and Balboa is not staying on balance
because of the long jab of the Russian.

979
01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:26.820
[Paulie] Keep working, Rock.

980
01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:41.748
Brace yourself!
Brace yourself!

981
01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.447
Get up! Hands up!

982
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.536
Charge him!
Charge him!

983
01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:48.364
[commentator 1] He can't
seem to touch the Russian.

984
01:12:52.846 --> 01:12:53.412
Cut him down!

985
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.422
[commentator] Rocky Balboa
is in serious trouble.

986
01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:06.730
They might have to stop this
one before somebody gets killed.

987
01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:09.297
[Duke] Reach and grab him!
Reach and grab him!

988
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:10.255
[commentator] Rocky's hurt.

989
01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:17.218
A right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring!

990
01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:18.829
And the champ is down!

991
01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.265
Back up!

992
01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:24.878
[crowd cheering] Drago! Drago!
Drago! Drago! Drago!

993
01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:27.098
[Rocky] Breathe.
Don't be scared.

994
01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:30.318
I can do it.

995
01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:33.409
Get up!

996
01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:35.323
Get up!

997
01:13:39.937 --> 01:13:41.895
[crowd chanting] Drago!

998
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:46.291
Come on, Rock!

999
01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:53.864
[commentator] Drago continuing
to punish Rocky Balboa.

1000
01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:56.257
He just will not
let him out of that corner,

1001
01:13:56.301 --> 01:14:00.218
and Rocky Balboa is just trying
to get through this first round.

1002
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.486
The Russian just threw Rocky Balboa
into his own corner like a rag doll.

1003
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.097
[crowd] Drago! Drago! Drago!

1004
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:19.542
Way to go, Rock. Come on.

1005
01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.239
You're fine.

1006
01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:22.501
You're fine.

1007
01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:26.766
It's been a tough first three
minutes for Rocky Balboa.

1008
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:29.856
He's not only fighting what appears
to be an invincible opponent,

1009
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.119
he's also fighting
a very hostile crowd

1010
01:14:32.163 --> 01:14:35.688
and the Russian premier and most
of the Politburo looking on.

1011
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.126
All right,
what's happening out there?

1012
01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:40.563
He's winning.

1013
01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:44.305
I see three of him out there.

1014
01:14:44.349 --> 01:14:45.655
Hit the one in the middle.

1015
01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:47.526
-Right! -Keep taking
it till it's got him.

1016
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.267
Okay?
That's gonna hurt him.

1017
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.704
-No pain.
-No pain. No pain.

1018
01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:54.141
Keep taking it to him.

1019
01:15:03.803 --> 01:15:05.979
Keep walking to him.
Keep walking to him.

1020
01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:07.067
Walk right in the middle.

1021
01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:08.852
-Take his heart.
-Yes. Take his heart.

1022
01:15:08.895 --> 01:15:10.506
Knock his brains out.
Come on, we're waiting here.

1023
01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:18.426
Keep going!

1024
01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:21.342
[commentator 1]
There's the bell for round two.

1025
01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:23.344
It's been
a one-sided fight so far.

1026
01:15:23.388 --> 01:15:25.521
[commentator 2] It'll take more than
luck for Rocky to survive this round.

1027
01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:26.826
Rocky's been
hit with bombs.

1028
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:28.698
[Paulie]
Slip him a hook!

1029
01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:30.351
[commentator 1] Rocky Balboa trying
to stay in the middle of the ring

1030
01:15:30.395 --> 01:15:31.614
against the big Russian.

1031
01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:33.398
[Duke]
Move down! That a baby!

1032
01:15:35.443 --> 01:15:36.836
Do what you gotta do!

1033
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.576
Stay with him!

1034
01:15:46.237 --> 01:15:48.326
[Paulie] Go for it!

1035
01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:50.546
[commentator 1] For all intents, Rocky
Balboa should be all finished tonight,

1036
01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.722
but he's fighting
back ferociously.

1037
01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:56.682
He's getting killed out there.

1038
01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:58.597
[commentator 1]
Drago's best punches so far.

1039
01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:01.948
He's cut and he's bleeding,
but he's on his feet and he's on the run.

1040
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.473
[Duke] Hold on!

1041
01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:08.389
Hold on!

1042
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.826
[crowd] Drago! Drago!

1043
01:16:11.392 --> 01:16:13.699
[Duke] He's cut!

1044
01:16:13.743 --> 01:16:15.701
[commentator 1] The Russian's
cut, and it's a bad cut,

1045
01:16:15.745 --> 01:16:19.009
and now it's Rocky Balboa
coming after Ivan Drago!

1046
01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:25.624
Give him more room!

1047
01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:29.062
Yes! Yes!

1048
01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.804
You got him! Yes!

1049
01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:32.588
Go get him!

1050
01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:37.810
[commentator]
Balboa picking up the Russian

1051
01:16:37.854 --> 01:16:40.247
and throws him to the ground
like a wrestler.

1052
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:44.512
It's a gutter war,
no holds barred in Moscow.

1053
01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:47.646
Rocky may be on the receiving end so
far, but he's here to fight.

1054
01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.259
This is shaping up
to be a personal war,

1055
01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:54.827
and right now,
it's anybody's boxing match.

1056
01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.969
You cut him! You hurt him!

1057
01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:09.059
You see? You see?
He's not a machine! He's a man!

1058
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.587
[Duke] Hey, Rock. No fear.
Hey, Rock. No fear.

1059
01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.589
No pain. No pain.

1060
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.634
Beat him with your mind.

1061
01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:27.294
You want it more than he does.
No pain!

1062
01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:29.993
Okay, take it to him!
Take it to him! Take it to him!

1063
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.099
Get up!

1064
01:18:25.309 --> 01:18:26.092
It's all right.

1065
01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:32.969
[commentator] And a good
right hand by Rocky Balboa!

1066
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:44.894
Come on, come on!

1067
01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:56.949
Rocky's got him now!

1068
01:19:04.827 --> 01:19:06.480
You're doing fine.
You're doing great.

1069
01:19:06.524 --> 01:19:07.568
You've come
a mighty long way, baby.

1070
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.751
-Crush him!
-Now!

1071
01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:38.774
-That's it! Keep going!
-Go, go!

1072
01:20:11.154 --> 01:20:11.981
Come on!

1073
01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:23.122
[commentator] A few cheers
now for Rocky Balboa!

1074
01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:25.733
Suddenly,
Moscow is pro-Rocky!

1075
01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:40.270
No pain. No pain.

1076
01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:43.882
Keep taking it to him,
you understand?

1077
01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:47.712
Take his heart.
No pain.

1078
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.514
[commentator 1] I'll tell you, Al,
this place is ready to explode.

1079
01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:10.082
[commentator 2] Lethal punch after punch!
Amazing willpower!

1080
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:18.874
[commentator 1]
Neither man backing off,

1081
01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:20.832
and Rocky Balboa's
determination

1082
01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.575
is actually beginning to win over
what was once a hostile crowd.

1083
01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:26.055
This is incredible!

1084
01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:30.668
[crowd chanting]
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

1085
01:21:31.582 --> 01:21:32.888
One more round.

1086
01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:35.368
There's no stopping us now.
This is our round.

1087
01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:49.992
Don't stop it now!
We start, and we don't stop!

1088
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:52.908
All your strength,
all your power, all your love,

1089
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:53.952
everything you've got!

1090
01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:34.427
Listen to 'em, Rock.

1091
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:35.951
They're calling your name.

1092
01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:37.039
They're calling your name.

1093
01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:39.215
Your boy hurt.
We stop fight now.

1094
01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:41.913
You'll stop nothin'.

1095
01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.829
I didn't come here
to end this fight sitting down.

1096
01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:46.962
I watch closely.

1097
01:22:47.005 --> 01:22:48.354
Yeah, you do that.

1098
01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:51.009
Go talk to him.
He's hurt too!

1099
01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:53.142
[commentator 1] There's the bell.
The war is on.

1100
01:22:53.185 --> 01:22:56.145
Your whole life, Rock.
This is your whole life. Do it now!

1101
01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:07.983
[commentator]
This is the last round.

1102
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.076
To the end.

1103
01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:15.991
Yeah.

1104
01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.080
[commentator 1] Which one
of these magnificent fighters

1105
01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:20.604
will be standing
at the end of this round?

1106
01:23:20.647 --> 01:23:23.520
[commentator 2] Drago snaps
out a stiff jab, and another.

1107
01:23:23.563 --> 01:23:24.608
[Rocky] Come on.

1108
01:23:25.826 --> 01:23:27.089
[commentator 1]
Another!

1109
01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.613
Rocky taking punishment,
trying to get inside.

1110
01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.136
He's completely exhausted.

1111
01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:38.013
Get up, Rock!

1112
01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:39.884
-Come on, Rock!
-Fight!

1113
01:23:39.927 --> 01:23:41.364
What are you waiting for?

1114
01:23:41.407 --> 01:23:42.365
Fight!

1115
01:23:43.366 --> 01:23:44.149
Hit him!

1116
01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:49.024
Come on! Come on, fight!

1117
01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:51.287
[crowd] Rocky! Rocky!

1118
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:52.418
Come on, fight!

1119
01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:01.079
[thudding]

1120
01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:06.041
Balboa is chopping
the Russian down!

1121

[Duke]
Don't stop, Rock!

1122
01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.003
[commentator 2] ...combinations
of punches on the Russian,

1123
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:14.266
and Drago throws
a hard right hand,

1124
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:15.833
which stuns Rocky Balboa.

1125
01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:22.318
Don't go down!

1126
01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:26.931
[commentator 1] You can forget
technique, forget strategy,

1127
01:24:26.974 --> 01:24:28.976
this is just a street fight.

1128
01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.674
It's a question
of who wants it most.

1129
01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:32.197
-What is he doing?
-He's winning.

1130
01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:38.508
Chop him down!

1131
01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:40.423
Come on!

1132
01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:44.818
Rocko! Rocko,
break his head!

1133
01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:46.342
Rocko, knock his head off!

1134
01:24:50.737 --> 01:24:52.261
Come on!
Finish him!

1135
01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:55.960
You're gonna do it!

1136
01:24:56.874 --> 01:24:58.005
Don't stop!

1137

[crowd cheering]

1138
01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:30.995
[commentator 1]
And these people love it!

1139
01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:34.085
It is absolute pandemonium.

1140
01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.219
[commentator 2] More than ever,
Rocky has proven himself a true champion!

1141
01:25:50.188 --> 01:25:52.364
[announcer speaking in Russian]

1142
01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:56.151
...Rocky Balboa!

1143
01:26:04.811 --> 01:26:06.422
When I came here tonight,

1144

[translating in Russian]

1145
01:26:10.034 --> 01:26:11.644
I didn't know what to expect.

1147
01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:15.779
I just saw a lot of people
hating me.

1149
01:26:19.086 --> 01:26:22.220
My best friend,
he once said,

[translating in Russian]

1151
01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:25.223
"You can't change."

[translating in Russian]

1155
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:39.542
In here, there were two guys
killing each other,

1156
01:26:39.585 --> 01:26:43.807
but I guess that's
better than 20 million.

1158
01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:49.247
So, what I'm trying to say is

1159
01:26:51.858 --> 01:26:54.209
that if I can change

1160
01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:56.167
[translating in Russian]

1161
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.908
and you can change,

01:27:00.432 --> 01:27:02.173
