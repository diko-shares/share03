Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead (2009)

3
00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.248
Yeah!

4
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.212
Go, Trey! Go!

5
00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.295
- Come on, man!
- You guys are slow!

6
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.133
- Don't get caught up in the rocks.
- Oh, my God!

7
00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.010
Come on. Keep it going north-south.

8
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.294
Look out for that rock!

9
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.171
Look out!

10
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.691
Right turn.

11
00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:39.818
That's it.

12
00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.052
Watch it!

13
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.327
Jesus, Alex. Anyone ever told you to go
slow when we first enter the chute?

14
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.415
Slow is for pussies.

15
00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.056
Get it in there.

16
00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.891
- Let's set up camp here for the night.
- All right. Let's pull the boats in.

17
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.377
This place is perfect.

18
00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.695
Hey. We're gonna go look
for some firewood.

19
00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.969
You do that.
I'm gonna blow a stick.

20
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.294
Don't hog all the kush.

21
00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.690
You are a total exhibitionist.

22
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.813
So what? The girls need to breathe.

23
00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.533
We're in the middle of the woods.
Who's gonna notice?

24
00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.456
I don't know. Some banjo-playing freak.

25
00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.490
- What?
- Forget it.

26
00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.818
Hey, where's Trey?

27
00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.851
The boy scout's gathering
the right kindling up the river.

28
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.254
Like there's a wrong kind.

29
00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.937
I'm gonna go look for him.

30
00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.215
You guys, don't do anything
that will scare the animals. Okay?

31
00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:02.929
Hey.

32
00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.333
Alex thinks I'm a slut.
Do you think I'm a slut?

33
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.576
Yes. But that is what I love about you.

34
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.212
I thought you loved my tits.

35
00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.297
I do. You have perfect tits.

36
00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:24.575
I could hold them forever.

37
00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.250
Please help me!

38
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.298
Help!

39
00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.378
Please, help! Help!

40
00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:17.290
Hey, come on!

41
00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:40.856
Why don't you step off, skinhead?

42
00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:43.129
You fight one bean,
you fight the whole burrito?

43
00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:48.411
You got your shit set?

44
00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.697
Just make sure your fucking taco jockeys
don't fuck it up.

45
00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:58.329
Don't test me.

46
00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.496
You know, normally,
I'd slit your throat for less.

47
00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:05.373
But seeing as we're business partners,
I think I'll let it slide.

48
00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:11.450
Just remember one thing.

49
00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:14.412
You're not the only one
that's good at slitting throats.

50
00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.410
Now, I paid you a lot of fucking money
to help put this together.

51
00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:21.897
So the shit better come good
like clockwork next week.

52
00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:25.250
Don't you worry, Chavez.
I won't burn you.

53
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:28.655
Money is money.
It makes the world go round.

54
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.615
I'm not worried...

55
00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:37.299
but we all know
how you like to burn things.

56
00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:40.531
Firebug.

57
00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:59.137
All right, keep moving.

58
00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:04.297
Let's go, guys.

59
00:09:11.939 --> 00:09:14.009
Man, he is an idiot.

60
00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.937
I'm just telling you what he told me.

61
00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:18.697
Hey. Late on your last day?

62
00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:21.094
Farmer will probably
write your ass up for it too.

63
00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:22.857
He can write all he wants.

64
00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:26.698
Damn, Nate, those are some
expensive-looking threads.

65
00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:28.457
You got to dress for success, Walter.

66
00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:31.457
Nate, I was just telling Walter here
how Sergeant Farmer was saying...

67
00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:33.968
you're probably just gonna flunk out
in your first semester anyway.

68
00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.732
Nice. I really care what he thinks.

69
00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:42.614
By the way, the warden wants to see you.
He says we got a transfer tonight.

70
00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:46.857
I just wanna have a peaceful shift and go
home, not go on a goddamn road trip.

71
00:09:47.859 --> 00:09:49.497
- See you out there, man.
- See ya.

72
00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:52.770
<i>Cell Block A-</i>
<i>prisoners, clear the yard.</i>

73
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.571
<i>Clear the yard.</i>

74
00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:56.576
- You wanted to see me, Warden?
- Nate.

75
00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:59.338
- You know Willy here, don't you?
- A prisoner from Cell Block 3.

76
00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:04.772
Willy Juarez is actually US Marshal
William Juarez. This is Marshal Davis.

77
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:06.855
They're gonna help us out
with the Hazelton transfer...

78
00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:09.254
specifically with Carlo Chavez.

79
00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:11.256
That transfer isn't supposed to happen
until next week.

80
00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:14.052
Yeah, I pushed it to tonight.
Our friends here got word...

81
00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:16.932
that Chavez's gang may attempt
to break him out during the transfer.

82
00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:18.697
We put Juarez undercover...

83
00:10:18.819 --> 00:10:20.889
to try and find out
who he's passing the information through.

84
00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.487
You chain him up
next to Chavez on the bus.

85
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:26.338
Nate, only you will know
my real identity in case of an incident.

86
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.417
Now, for this to work,
Chavez has to trust me.

87
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:31.973
As an added precaution,
I've altered your route.

88
00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:34.488
Nobody knows it
but the people in this room.

89
00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:36.018
I'm counting on you, Nate.

90
00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:53.495
- Thanks, Ally.
- No problem, boss.

91
00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:00.935
Sheriff's station. Deputy Lane speaking.

92
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.211
Yeah.

93
00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:04.249
When?

94
00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:07.096
What type of vehicle were they driving?

95
00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:09.494
Yeah. Where can we reach you?

96
00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:12.977
Thanks. We'll get back to you.

97
00:11:14.539 --> 00:11:16.211
Some college kids went missing.

98
00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.057
They were river rafting
and didn't come back.

99
00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.817
- How long?
- Couple of days.

100
00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:21.577
- Where?
- Bluefish River area.

101
00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:23.849
They probably stayed over
so they could camp a little longer.

102
00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:27.016
- I'll take a drive out there.
- I could do that, Sheriff. You don't have to.

103
00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:29.255
No. It's fine.

104
00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:31.578
I could use the fresh air.

105
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:33.178
Come on, Leon!

106
00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:36.493
Hey, come on! Hey!

107
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.012
What the fuck do you want?

108
00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:52.414
We're going on a bus ride, Mr. Chavez.

109
00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:53.494
What, now?

110
00:11:53.619 --> 00:11:56.087
Yeah, now. You know the drill.

111
00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:01.812
Well, this shit ain't right.
Where are you taking me?

112
00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:03.657
Hazelton.

113
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.576
But they said I wasn't going
till next week.

114
00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:07.894
I guess they couldn't wait to see you.

115
00:12:09.939 --> 00:12:11.167
What about my shit?

116
00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:13.415
We'll have it boxed up and shipped.
Let's move, Chavez.

117
00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:15.336
Touch me again,
I'll break your fuckin' fingers.

118
00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:18.610
Just move your ass
before I lose my patience.

119
00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:32.769
Oh, no, you don't. No. You're not chaining
that murderer next to me.

120
00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:34.696
Shut up, Crawford.

121
00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:37.731
Let's get Chavez up front followed by
Juarez here and then the rest of'em.

122
00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:39.812
What's your problem?

123
00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:42.533
My problem is I don't wanna be chained
to a wack job...

124
00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.173
who went all posttraumatic stress
on some poor asshole in a bar.

125
00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:48.894
I mean- You know, couldn't
hack the war, soldier boy?

126
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.498
Can't handle your liquor?

127
00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.691
Listen. I pushed the guy. He fell.
And he hit his head.

128
00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:55.411
Okay? I'm innocent.

129
00:12:55.539 --> 00:12:58.611
- Yeah. So am I.
- So is everyone else in here.

130
00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:02.015
Never trust a con.

131
00:13:02.139 --> 00:13:05.097
I'm not buying your bullshit,
soldier boy.

132
00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:07.335
I heard you had your hands
all up in the cash register.

133
00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:09.734
-Just leave me alone.
- Oh, now.

134
00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:11.850
Soldier boy wants to be left alone.

135
00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.495
Shit, what?
You get a "Dear John" letter?

136
00:13:15.619 --> 00:13:17.211
Yeah. Yeah, went psycho...

137
00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.456
when you found out your wife was fucking
a real marine, you punk-ass bitch?

138
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:21.932
That's enough. Shut up.

139
00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:24.732
Man, I'm just saying.
I don't wanna be chained to a murderer.

140
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:27.134
I mean, at least stealing cars,
that's an honorable trade.

141
00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:31.093
Jesus Christ, Crawford. Floyd over here
killed three people that we know about.

142
00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:32.618
That's different, man.

143
00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:34.730
- Floyd's my friend.
-Just get moving!

144
00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:39.618
Keep it moving.

145
00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:47.535
Get out of the way. Move.
Watch your step.

146
00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:51.176
Here are the transfers. Gas up here.

147
00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:52.812
The sheriff will be told you're coming...

148
00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:55.737
20 minutes
before you're scheduled to arrive.

149
00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:17.893
Stupid shit, making us go all night.

150
00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:21.011
Fucking bullshit! Don't you think?

151
00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:23.212
Shut the fuck up and don't talk.

152
00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:26.056
Floyd. What the hell?

153
00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:28.215
- What you laughing at, bitch?
- Fuck you, Adolf.

154
00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:30.534
- You're dead, wetback.
- Enough!

155
00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:33.856
It's not him you should be worrying about.
Right?

156
00:14:33.979 --> 00:14:36.413
It's all right. I got the word out.

157
00:14:37.699 --> 00:14:39.769
It better be all right, homes.

158
00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:41.494
So...

159
00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.730
what you gonna do
when you graduate law school?

160
00:14:45.859 --> 00:14:47.087
Practice law.

161
00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.733
I know that, wiseass.

162
00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:51.178
What kind of law?

163
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:53.529
Kind that buys me a townhouse
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

164
00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:57.771
- So it's all about money?
- I plan on doing some pro bono work.

165
00:14:57.899 --> 00:14:59.696
But first I got to be successful.

166
00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:02.857
You got some pretty big expectations.

167
00:15:02.979 --> 00:15:05.777
I put myself through school, and I'm gonna
put myself through law school.

168
00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:09.209
And when I'm all done,
I wanna retire to, like, Miami.

169
00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:13.127
South Beach. Live a nice,
comfortable life, you know.

170
00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:16.091
Retire?

171
00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:18.096
Man, you'll be too old to enjoy it.

172
00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:21.655
Money isn't everything, my friend.

173
00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:51.093
I gotta go.

174
00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:52.288
Just can't wait.

175
00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:55.411
- Move.
- Oh, God.

176
00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:57.177
Walter, where's the fire?

177
00:15:57.299 --> 00:15:58.618
Man, I got to go.

178
00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:00.695
Hey, hey, me too, man.
Can you hurry it up?

179
00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:03.253
You will each have an opportunity
to use the restroom.

180
00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:09.412
Keep moving.

181
00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:11.291
Hey, sweetie.

182
00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:13.296
Nate? Nate Wilson?

183
00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.250
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Hi, Sheriff.

184
00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:17.529
I haven't seen you
since you were about 12.

185
00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:19.172
Not since your folks moved away.

186
00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:21.893
Is that Leon? Here, boy.

187
00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:25.216
Sure is. Fourteen years old
and still acts like a knucklehead.

188
00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:28.058
- How's your dad?
- Dad passed away a few years back.

189
00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:30.215
- Mom's fine though.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

190
00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:31.567
Next.

191
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.497
He was a good man. He was a great help
when we had that trouble...

192
00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.496
at the old mill years ago.

193
00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:38.450
I think it got to him.

194
00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:40.888
I can't believe how you've grown.

195
00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:43.658
- Law enforcement to boot.
- You two know each other?

196
00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:45.497
Sure thing.
Nate was brought up around here.

197
00:16:45.619 --> 00:16:48.372
Damn, Nate. I knew you were a hick.

198
00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:50.217
But, shit, this is the middle of nowhere.

199
00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:51.328
Yeah.

200
00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:52.528
- Coffee?
- Be great.

201
00:16:52.659 --> 00:16:53.614
Yeah.

202
00:16:59.579 --> 00:17:01.649
That better be my name tag
you're staring at.

203
00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:04.088
Are those guns standard issue, baby?

204
00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:07.652
- What did you just say?
- Easy there, honeypot.

205
00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:09.690
You like the rough stuff?

206
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.812
Hell, I can do that. Even all tied up,
I can show a girl a good time.

207
00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:15.338
You like being tied up?

208
00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:18.531
You mean all hog-tied, bound and gagged
to where I can't move a muscle?

209
00:17:18.659 --> 00:17:20.729
Yeah. That's it, baby.

210
00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.772
No. I don't like to be tied up.

211
00:17:24.899 --> 00:17:27.254
- Now, don't be that way, sugar.
- You, get moving.

212
00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:33.448
Thanks.

213
00:17:34.699 --> 00:17:36.018
So...

214
00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:40.212
why are you going through Greenbrier?

215
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:44.218
High-profile prisoner. They wanted
to keep the route confidential.

216
00:17:44.339 --> 00:17:47.376
- You going by the old mill road?
- Yeah. That's the plan.

217
00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:50.730
Until we hook up with the main highway
on the other side of the mountain.

218
00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:12.657
- It's good to see you, Nate. Safe trip.
- Thanks, Sheriff.

219
00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:15.498
Hey, hey. Give us a call
when you get through the backcountry.

220
00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:18.417
Or give me your cell, and I'll call you.

221
00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:21.212
Maybe we can grab a beer
on your way back.

222
00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:22.567
Sounds good.

223
00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:59.248
I think it's a conspiracy.

224
00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:03.770
I mean, the World Bank is owned
by 12 motherfuckers...

225
00:20:03.899 --> 00:20:06.208
who run our lives.

226
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.170
And they decide
to put us in the recession...

227
00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:10.176
just when I'm about to buy a house.

228
00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:14.453
You know, it's like that
old Michael Douglas movie.

229
00:20:14.579 --> 00:20:16.137
You know, the one with the 12 judges...

230
00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:18.329
that decide to hand out
their own form of justice?

231
00:20:19.499 --> 00:20:22.218
- What was it again?
<i>- The Star Chamber.</i>

232
00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:24.295
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

233
00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:27.809
Yeah, I mean, the World Bank
is the fucking Star Chamber.

234
00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:31.658
- Hello.
- What is it?

235
00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:33.735
There's some asshole
blinking his high beam.

236
00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:36.452
Go around, asshole!

237
00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:40.411
Now he's slowing down.

238
00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:43.694
- Make up your mind, prick.
-Just keep cool. Don't slow down.

239
00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:51.738
He just shut off his lights.

240
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:54.168
We're in an emergency procedure.
Don't stop.

241
00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:55.891
This could be an escape attempt.

242
00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:00.136
What the fuck is going on?

243
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.375
Get on the radio now.

244
00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:03.727
Hazelton-

245
00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:06.014
Hazelton...

246
00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:08.175
this is Custody Bus-

247
00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:17.489
Holy shit!

248
00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:19.529
Damn it.

249
00:21:23.219 --> 00:21:26.370
Hazelton, this is Custody Bus 2
from Grafton Penitentiary.

250
00:21:26.499 --> 00:21:28.330
Come in. Over. Come in. Over!

251
00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:34.938
Oh, fuck!

252
00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.614
Hey, guard! Come on!

253
00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:45.936
Let us out!
We're gonna fry! Come on! Get up!

254
00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:49.250
Hey, don't let me burn!

255
00:22:49.379 --> 00:22:51.290
- Please, I don't wanna burn!
- Of course.

256
00:22:51.419 --> 00:22:53.979
Of course the fucking torch
doesn't wanna burn.

257
00:22:54.099 --> 00:22:56.010
- Walter!
- Come on, man!

258
00:22:56.139 --> 00:22:58.209
Please get us out of here!
We're gonna burn!

259
00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:00.375
Everybody move to the back of the bus.

260
00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:05.656
Chavez, move.
We're getting out the back. Come on!

261
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.096
Get up! Come on.

262
00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:43.258
Get the fuck up.

263
00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:47.737
Now, don't be a hero, and we'll be cool.

264
00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:50.168
- All right?
- Let me get the other two out of the bus.

265
00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:53.052
Shut the fuck up and hand me the keys.

266
00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:55.090
They're in the bus. I dropped them.

267
00:23:56.739 --> 00:23:59.572
Drop the gun,
or I'll blow your face off.

268
00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:05.250
Maybe I should just save the state
the cost of room and board.

269
00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:14.337
You guys see that shit?
Right in the fucking neck.

270
00:24:16.699 --> 00:24:18.690
Hey, guys, come on out!

271
00:24:19.579 --> 00:24:21.137
Your idiots nearly killed us all.

272
00:24:23.459 --> 00:24:25.415
What the fuck was that?

273
00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:28.058
Shoot the fucker. Come on!

274
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:34.892
Who's out there?

275
00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:37.897
Let's move before the bus blows.
You, move.

276
00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:40.169
- Walter's still on the bus.
- I don't give a shit. Move.

277
00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:43.732
Now! Come on. Let's get out of here.

278
00:24:50.299 --> 00:24:53.132
I know I'm a redneck,
but a bow and fucking arrow?

279
00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:56.057
- Who the fuck does that?
- I don't know, and I don't give a shit.

280
00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:58.170
All I know is we're all
getting the fuck out of here.

281
00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:01.814
You, get in that bus.
Get me the keys for these chains.

282
00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.487
Walter.

283
00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:16.695
Come on. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on. I got you.

284
00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:47.978
Smart move.

285
00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.658
Now, get him up.

286
00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:01.292
Get going.

287
00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:16.050
Okay, let's stop here
and get off these fucking leg irons.

288
00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:25.054
Fuck.

289
00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:27.492
What's up with these keys?

290
00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.052
There are three different sets of keys.

291
00:26:30.139 --> 00:26:33.495
One for the cuffs, one for the cage,
and one for the leg irons.

292
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:35.655
- Hand me the other ones.
- They were in the bus.

293
00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:39.567
- This is the only set I found.
- Fucking liar. Kill him.

294
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:41.655
I say who lives and who dies.

295
00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:43.735
The fuck you do, asshole.

296
00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:50.855
Let's just find out exactly what's going on
around here. All right?

297
00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:54.850
When was Hazelton expecting us?

298
00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:56.697
Just before dawn.

299
00:26:56.819 --> 00:27:00.778
All right.
Now, that gives us a five-hour head start.

300
00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:04.414
We ain't going anywhere in a hurry
all tethered together by the ankles like this.

301
00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:08.134
You're right. We have to find a way
of getting out of these irons.

302
00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:12.138
You. Sheriff said you grew up around here.
Which way do we go?

303
00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:15.092
- It's been years. I don't know.
-Just kill the son of a bitch, man.

304
00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:18.928
No, no, no, no. Officer Wilson here's
gonna be my compass.

305
00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:22.176
You take me to a phone, you live.

306
00:27:22.299 --> 00:27:24.529
You don't, you die.

307
00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:26.297
Do I make myself clear?

308
00:27:26.419 --> 00:27:28.057
Yeah.

309
00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:30.534
- Good.
- What about whoever's out there?

310
00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:33.332
They won't be coming back
if they know what's good for them.

311
00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:37.090
Now, which way do we go?

312
00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:38.698
There's an old forest ranger's
fire watchtower...

313
00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:40.093
near the top of the mountain.

314
00:27:40.219 --> 00:27:42.130
It should have communication equipment.

315
00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:44.136
- A radio. Maybe a cell phone.
- Good.

316
00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:47.296
So pick up your pig and lead the way.

317
00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:03.249
Miami. South Beach.
That's where I should be.

318
00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:06.530
Retired and surrounded by pussy.

319
00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:08.092
Sounds like a plan.

320
00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:09.891
Hurry it up.

321
00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:12.453
You kill that motherfucker
first chance you get. You hear me?

322
00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:14.297
I hear you, Walter. Save your energy.

323
00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:18.170
There he is!

324
00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:22.847
Take it easy.

325
00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:25.095
- Take it easy. Nobody wants to hurt you.
- Is that one of'em?

326
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:28.097
- A fucking little bitch did all this?
- Don't be stupid.

327
00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:30.369
She wasn't on the tow truck.
She's got nothing to do with this.

328
00:28:30.499 --> 00:28:31.978
Let's just cap the bitch and move on.

329
00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:33.691
You're gonna be fine.

330
00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:35.696
Maybe we should fuck her first.

331
00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:38.617
I don't know about you,
but it's been a long time.

332
00:28:38.739 --> 00:28:40.775
Who are you? What are you doing here?

333
00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:43.288
Just let me go before it finds me.

334
00:28:43.419 --> 00:28:45.057
- Please.
-Just let her go.

335
00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:46.328
We don't need her.

336
00:28:46.459 --> 00:28:48.689
-Just shut up, asshole.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

337
00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:50.047
What happened to you?

338
00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:52.488
My friends and I were rafting
on the Bluefish River...

339
00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:54.814
two days ago.

340
00:28:54.939 --> 00:28:57.578
We were having a good time.

341
00:28:57.699 --> 00:29:00.133
We stopped for the night.
Then it happened.

342
00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:02.454
- What?
- It killed my friends.

343
00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:05.377
"It"? I thought it was
just some hillbilly.

344
00:29:05.499 --> 00:29:07.057
It eats people.

345
00:29:08.419 --> 00:29:11.456
No. You got to be out of your mind.

346
00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:13.809
It's a fucking mutant! Deformed!

347
00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:16.294
It's got, like, three fingers on one hand.

348
00:29:16.419 --> 00:29:17.932
And it kills to feed.

349
00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:19.774
I've seen it.

350
00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:22.174
So then, why doesn't it eat
the animals in the woods?

351
00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:23.812
Because there are none.

352
00:29:23.939 --> 00:29:26.931
It's a cannibal. We're its food.

353
00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:30.372
We're gonna get you out of here.
Everything's gonna be okay.

354
00:29:30.499 --> 00:29:32.888
- What's your name?
- Alex.

355
00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:35.135
I'm Nate.

356
00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:37.136
Looks like you're screwed too,
aren't you, Nate?

357
00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:39.697
Did you just say rafts?

358
00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:42.936
Yeah. Two of'em.

359
00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:46.216
Then that's our way out of here.

360
00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:48.728
Down the river.

361
00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:52.408
Now, you take us there, sugar tits,
and I'll make it worth your while.

362
00:29:52.539 --> 00:29:55.178
I think I was better off with that freak.

363
00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:57.767
Now move. Move!

364
00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:08.294
Hey. How old do you think she is?

365
00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:10.250
I don't know, man. Twenty maybe.

366
00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:15.407
Goddamn it. I think I'm gonna make
that one sit and spin.

367
00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:17.655
Man, not if I don't first.

368
00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:21.374
Hey, baby. Baby.
Hey, you like cars?

369
00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:24.377
I can jack you any car
your sweet little ass wants.

370
00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:33.458
Well, would you look at that.

371
00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:36.332
Hey, Floyd, check it out.
Is that an armored car?

372
00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:39.287
Which way?

373
00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:42.215
I'm not sure.

374
00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:44.648
I thought it was this way.

375
00:30:44.779 --> 00:30:46.656
But it doesn't look familiar.

376
00:30:48.579 --> 00:30:49.694
Careful.

377
00:30:54.739 --> 00:30:57.811
You. How old would you say
that thing is?

378
00:30:59.619 --> 00:31:01.177
Late '50s maybe.

379
00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.817
Let's go.

380
00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:11.014
Still locked.

381
00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:14.336
- Climb in the cab and take a look around.
- We're wasting valuable time.

382
00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:16.256
- Let's just go.
- He's right.

383
00:31:16.379 --> 00:31:17.368
Let's go.

384
00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:22.936
Shut the fuck up, bitch, and don't even
think about giving me an attitude.

385
00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:25.698
'Cause I'll shoot you where you stand,
you hear?

386
00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:31.018
You. I said climb in the fucking cab
and take a look around.

387
00:31:49.979 --> 00:31:52.447
- Any dead bodies?
- No. They're gone.

388
00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:56.531
They must have been ejected.
You guys have a look around for bones.

389
00:31:56.659 --> 00:31:58.536
One of the guards
must have had some keys.

390
00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:00.570
I don't think you'll find anything.

391
00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:02.530
Why?

392
00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:05.093
Because somebody broke the windshield
from the outside to get inside.

393
00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:06.857
All the glass is in here.

394
00:32:06.979 --> 00:32:10.654
And judging from the amount of
dried blood, they died in the cab.

395
00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:12.610
You find anything else?

396
00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:14.775
No.

397
00:32:14.899 --> 00:32:15.968
Then get out of there.

398
00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:27.098
Found these.

399
00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:31.055
This might just be our lucky day.

400
00:32:41.179 --> 00:32:42.578
Well, I'll be damned.

401
00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:53.375
Sweet Mother of Jesus!

402
00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:54.852
We're fucking rich!

403
00:32:54.979 --> 00:32:57.937
Holy shit!
How much money do you think's in there?

404
00:32:58.059 --> 00:32:59.014
Who cares?

405
00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:02.051
- It'll just slow us down.
- Fine. We'll split your share.

406
00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:03.771
The fuck we will.

407
00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.730
It's equal shares all around.

408
00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:09.652
Why would I give a little fucking beaner
like you anything?

409
00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:14.218
He won't suspect you.

410
00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:25.975
You fucking morons.

411
00:33:26.659 --> 00:33:28.570
A little money,
and you all lose your mind?

412
00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:32.128
This is how it's gonna work.

413
00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:35.012
Each of you will carry two bags.

414
00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:36.128
You.

415
00:33:36.259 --> 00:33:39.012
- Hand out the bags.
- I don't want the money.

416
00:33:39.139 --> 00:33:42.097
I don't give a shit what you want.
You're carrying the cash. Got it?

417
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:54.211
- You too.
- I have to help Walter. He can't walk.

418
00:33:54.339 --> 00:33:57.251
I don't give a shit what you got to do.
Pick up the bags.

419
00:33:57.379 --> 00:33:59.290
Go on. Go on.

420
00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:06.015
Now move. Move!

421
00:34:06.139 --> 00:34:07.413
Go on.

422
00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.014
- Him too.
- He can't. He's too badly injured.

423
00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:14.935
- I'll carry his bags.
- Or I will.

424
00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.175
Everybody's got to carry their own weight.

425
00:34:19.539 --> 00:34:20.938
- Now, pick 'em up.
- Please.

426
00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:23.414
-Just let me carry the bags for Walter.
- Shut up!

427
00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:29.809
I'm waiting.

428
00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.170
You smiling bastard.

429
00:34:38.499 --> 00:34:39.898
Pick 'em up.

430
00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.217
Pick 'em up!

431
00:35:04.379 --> 00:35:06.847
You know what they say about money,
don't you, Chavez?

432
00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:09.097
I don't know, Corrections Officer.

433
00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:11.210
What do they say about money?

434
00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:14.736
They say money's hard to spend...

435
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:17.377
when you're dead.

436
00:35:40.779 --> 00:35:43.498
Now, that was a stupid thing
to do, now, wasn't it?

437
00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:46.336
Now just pick up the bags.

438
00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:48.890
Shove it up your ass.

439
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:52.854
Okay.

440
00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:56.335
You hear me?
Shove it up your ass, motherfucker.

441
00:35:58.499 --> 00:36:00.854
- Oh, my God!
- No! Walter!

442
00:36:00.979 --> 00:36:01.889
Walter!

443
00:36:02.019 --> 00:36:04.408
Don't. Don't do it. Not now.

444
00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:07.617
You stubborn fuck.

445
00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:23.291
What the fuck?

446
00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:32.969
Come here.

447
00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:42.330
This is what's been fucking with us?
A mutant kid?

448
00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:43.858
That's not him.

449
00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:46.410
This thing was a full-grown man.

450
00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:49.050
He was deformed like him.

451
00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:52.774
Would you look at that.
It's got three fucking toes.

452
00:36:52.899 --> 00:36:54.651
Probably his kid.

453
00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:57.570
Okay.

454
00:36:57.699 --> 00:37:00.850
Now, let's send
this cocksucking hillbilly a message.

455
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:04.374
You. Hold it.

456
00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:10.937
- Floyd.
- Yeah.

457
00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:13.050
- Hold him down.
- Come here.

458
00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:14.612
Hold him down.

459
00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:16.812
Hold him down.

460
00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:29.218
Here's the rafts.

461
00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:32.058
What? That's a two-man raft.

462
00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:34.568
That's not gonna hold
all of us and the money.

463
00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:38.293
- So what do we do now?
- It's just for the bags.

464
00:37:38.419 --> 00:37:40.728
You can go fuck yourself
if you think you're taking it all.

465
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.248
Let's worry about that
once we get these chains off.

466
00:37:43.379 --> 00:37:45.256
Man, that ain't gonna work.

467
00:37:48.819 --> 00:37:50.252
This might sting a little at first.

468
00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:55.568
God... damn it! Fuck!

469
00:37:55.699 --> 00:37:58.975
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- You said the rocks weren't gonna work.

470
00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:01.659
- So I thought that'd do the trick.
- Are you fucking crazy?

471
00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:04.054
I don't know. Maybe I am.

472
00:38:04.179 --> 00:38:06.613
How are we gonna deal with the boat?

473
00:38:06.739 --> 00:38:08.934
Let's just get it in the river first...

474
00:38:09.059 --> 00:38:12.131
and then we'll
figure it all out, all right?

475
00:38:12.259 --> 00:38:15.296
- I don't think that's a good idea, man.
- Shut up, Crawford.

476
00:38:19.899 --> 00:38:21.378
Now we're walking.

477
00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:24.138
You stupid son of a bitch!

478
00:38:24.259 --> 00:38:25.408
Oh, God!

479
00:38:26.979 --> 00:38:30.938
Fuckin' asshole!
Why did you fuckin' do that?

480
00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:34.938
Why did you fuckin' do that?
Tell me! Fuckin' tell me!

481
00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:37.095
Stop it! Stop it!

482
00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:39.691
You got something to say?

483
00:38:41.179 --> 00:38:43.488
You got something to fucking say?

484
00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:46.249
Looks like you still need this mule
to carry your money.

485
00:38:50.659 --> 00:38:54.857
That's right. Then I guess it's back to you,
Corrections Officer Wilson.

486
00:38:59.419 --> 00:39:03.970
Now, you wanna live,
you get me the fuck out of here.

487
00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:05.976
Now, lead on! Lead on!

488
00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.133
Get up! Get up!

489
00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:11.817
Give me that.

490
00:39:16.819 --> 00:39:19.014
Now, move! Move!

491
00:39:20.019 --> 00:39:21.896
Get a fucking move on.

492
00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:47.009
Sounds like he's learned his lesson.

493
00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:49.175
Either that, or we just pissed him off.

494
00:39:54.939 --> 00:39:56.850
<i>Good evening.</i>

495
00:40:00.859 --> 00:40:01.769
Hello.

496
00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.969
<i>Hi, Sheriff. I just got a call</i>
<i>from a Cliff Moore.</i>

497
00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:06.772
He said he spotted a truck
up by the upper river inlet yesterday.

498
00:40:06.899 --> 00:40:09.413
- Any sign of the kids?
- No.

499
00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:12.611
If it's all the same, I thought
I'd drive out and take a look.

500
00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:14.536
Any word from Nate Wilson
or the corrections office?

501
00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:15.648
<i>No. Not a peep.</i>

502
00:40:15.779 --> 00:40:17.576
Why? Were you expecting a call?

503
00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:19.610
<i>No. I just got a bad feeling, that's all.</i>

504
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:21.457
I'll be there in a minute.

505
00:40:24.899 --> 00:40:26.412
What is that?

506
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:31.694
It can't be,
but it looks like Preslow's keys.

507
00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:36.732
Good. Now we can get
these fuckin' chains off.

508
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:39.213
Now!

509
00:40:56.419 --> 00:40:59.252
Come on,
you motherfuckin' hillbilly! Come get me!

510
00:41:00.579 --> 00:41:02.456
You got a death wish?

511
00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:05.457
Don't fuck with me again. Right?

512
00:41:09.499 --> 00:41:10.409
Fuck.

513
00:41:21.939 --> 00:41:23.418
What the hell is going on?

514
00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:25.897
I'll tell you what's going on.

515
00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:27.816
He's gonna kill us all.
That's what's going on.

516
00:41:27.939 --> 00:41:29.736
He's hunting us.

517
00:41:29.859 --> 00:41:32.612
He won't be the only one hunting us
in a couple of hours.

518
00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:34.377
So let's go.

519
00:41:34.499 --> 00:41:35.978
How are we supposed to do that?

520
00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:01.855
Here. Cut it at the knee joint.

521
00:42:01.979 --> 00:42:04.129
You don't have to cut through any bone.

522
00:42:06.539 --> 00:42:09.292
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fucking pussy. Give me that.

523
00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:13.818
Fucking wetback.

524
00:42:18.339 --> 00:42:19.931
At the knee joint. That's it.

525
00:42:21.699 --> 00:42:23.098
Piece of shit.

526
00:42:26.739 --> 00:42:29.094
Okay. Let's get out of here.

527
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:31.414
Come on. Get your bags.
Let's get out of here.

528
00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:36.852
Take that. Come on! Move!

529
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:42.135
Why don't you call Hazelton?

530
00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:44.295
And say what exactly?

531
00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:47.889
That I got a bad feeling?
That Nate didn't answer his cell?

532
00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:50.533
It just seems like
an awful lot of effort for a hunch.

533
00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:54.049
Well, it's my hunch, so it's my effort.

534
00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:56.693
You really think they staged a breakout?

535
00:42:56.819 --> 00:42:58.696
I don't know what to think, Ally.

536
00:42:58.819 --> 00:43:01.413
What about that truck up by the river?

537
00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:02.938
You follow it up.

538
00:43:07.259 --> 00:43:09.011
What is this place?

539
00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:11.733
This doesn't look like the watchtower.

540
00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:14.168
It's not.
I've never seen this place before.

541
00:43:14.299 --> 00:43:16.938
There has to be some tools
that we can use on these chains.

542
00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:19.448
- And you better make it quick.
- Move.

543
00:43:25.819 --> 00:43:26.854
Jackpot!

544
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.891
- Give me that.
- Wait your turn, asshole.

545
00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:39.257
How much farther?

546
00:43:40.179 --> 00:43:42.329
I'm not sure.
A couple hours maybe.

547
00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:44.177
You better find it.

548
00:43:46.939 --> 00:43:48.657
Man, I got to go pinch a loaf.

549
00:43:51.139 --> 00:43:53.209
- I say we split up.
- No.

550
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.533
Maybe it's a good idea.

551
00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:57.731
You think this is a democracy?
You wanna fuckin' debate me?

552
00:43:57.859 --> 00:43:59.895
What happens when we meet up
with your men?

553
00:44:00.019 --> 00:44:01.657
What are you gonna do then, Chavez?

554
00:44:01.779 --> 00:44:03.929
What ever happened
to honor among thieves?

555
00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:07.335
You're gonna kill us all. Then you're
gonna take the cash for yourself.

556
00:44:07.459 --> 00:44:08.858
That's what you're gonna do.

557
00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.731
Yeah, you're right.

558
00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:12.929
I probably will kill all of you.

559
00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:14.651
Then why shouldn't we kill you now?

560
00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:18.055
Good luck. And you better be quick,
or you're surely gonna be dead.

561
00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:20.056
Then I'll kill all you motherfuckers.

562
00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:24.135
But I don't think
that's in your best interest...

563
00:44:24.259 --> 00:44:25.692
compared to a compromise.

564
00:44:25.819 --> 00:44:29.255
Hey. Hey. I just wiped my ass
with a hundred dollar bill.

565
00:44:29.379 --> 00:44:32.689
It's comin' out of your share, asshole.
Now, shut the fuck up.

566
00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:36.772
- What do you propose?
- You got one gun. I got two.

567
00:44:36.899 --> 00:44:38.617
These humps have none.

568
00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:41.492
Now, I can't carry
all the bags of cash on my own.

569
00:44:42.499 --> 00:44:45.332
And if you kill me,
that's one less pair of hands.

570
00:44:45.459 --> 00:44:47.495
Plus I have something none of you do.

571
00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:49.735
- Yeah? What's that?
- Infrastructure.

572
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:51.008
What?

573
00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:53.414
My men will find me.

574
00:44:53.539 --> 00:44:57.168
And all of you can come with us
to a safe house and not be on the run.

575
00:44:57.299 --> 00:45:00.371
And in exchange for that, you give me
one of the bags you're all carrying...

576
00:45:00.499 --> 00:45:02.615
and you all get to keep the other one.

577
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:04.172
How can you trust him, Floyd?

578
00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:06.771
We can't.

579
00:45:09.819 --> 00:45:11.332
Deal.

580
00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:19.657
Now get this bum up.

581
00:45:22.779 --> 00:45:25.247
Sorry about your friends.

582
00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:27.734
This isn't going to end well.

583
00:45:27.859 --> 00:45:28.974
I know that.

584
00:45:29.099 --> 00:45:30.817
Then why are you going along with them?

585
00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:33.296
Up to now, being all chained together...

586
00:45:33.419 --> 00:45:35.694
I really didn't have
much of a choice, did I?

587
00:45:38.219 --> 00:45:41.370
So that's the fourth time we've passed
that tree in the last two hours.

588
00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:44.655
What are you up to, Nate?

589
00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:46.417
Bidin' my time.

590
00:45:47.259 --> 00:45:49.614
Chavez catches on, man, he'll kill you.

591
00:45:50.499 --> 00:45:54.970
He's right, Nate.
Even I noticed. You gotta be careful.

592
00:45:57.499 --> 00:46:00.411
You should go back to the road.
Turn yourself in when the police arrive.

593
00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:03.337
I am not going back
through the woods alone, unarmed...

594
00:46:03.459 --> 00:46:05.973
to get sliced up by that hillbilly freak.

595
00:46:06.819 --> 00:46:08.855
I don't know who's worse- him or Chavez.

596
00:46:10.339 --> 00:46:12.011
Listen.

597
00:46:12.139 --> 00:46:15.529
I'll do what I can to help you
once we've reached the ranger station.

598
00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:18.253
I appreciate that, but I think
you should look after yourself first.

599
00:46:18.379 --> 00:46:20.939
Chavez isn't gonna bring anyone along
for the ride that he can't use.

600
00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:22.811
You're damn right.

601
00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:25.214
He'll kill us all for the money.

602
00:46:25.339 --> 00:46:27.455
If that cannibal freak
doesn't beat him to it.

603
00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:31.938
It's ironic.

604
00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:35.289
- What is?
- Money.

605
00:46:35.979 --> 00:46:38.015
I struggled my whole life
to put myself through school...

606
00:46:38.139 --> 00:46:40.289
so I could get out of here
and make good money.

607
00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:41.454
So?

608
00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:45.618
Now I'm holding in my hands more money
than most people ever make in a lifetime...

609
00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:47.775
and all I wanna do is get rid of it.

610
00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:19.972
This is a logging access road.

611
00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:22.055
Fire watchtower's on the other side
further along the mountain.

612
00:47:22.179 --> 00:47:24.898
Hang on. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on. Crawford.

613
00:47:25.019 --> 00:47:26.293
Come here.

614
00:47:27.939 --> 00:47:30.373
- Think you can jack that thing?
- Piece of cake, man.

615
00:47:30.499 --> 00:47:32.729
Finally, a ride out of this shit-hole.

616
00:47:32.859 --> 00:47:35.817
Wait a minute. That's the tow truck
that ran us off the road.

617
00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:41.570
That's why Crawford here
is gonna go get it for us.

618
00:47:41.699 --> 00:47:43.098
Right, Crawford?

619
00:47:43.219 --> 00:47:45.574
I don't know about that, man. I mean-

620
00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:49.889
It's a truck.
Just run over there and check it out.

621
00:47:50.019 --> 00:47:52.738
Come on! We got the cash.
Now let's get the hell out of here!

622
00:47:52.859 --> 00:47:54.975
No way, man! Send soldier boy, damn it!

623
00:47:55.099 --> 00:47:57.897
I'm not the car thief. You are.

624
00:48:01.019 --> 00:48:02.498
Could be a trap, man.

625
00:48:03.259 --> 00:48:05.648
Get movin', asshole. Go on.

626
00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:12.058
Damn it.

627
00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:39.534
Help me! Please!

628
00:48:47.459 --> 00:48:49.370
Fuckin' hillbilly motherfucker!

629
00:48:49.499 --> 00:48:52.696
I'm gonna find you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

630
00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:54.609
No!

631
00:48:57.939 --> 00:49:01.170
Let's backtrack and get as far away
from here as possible.

632
00:49:01.299 --> 00:49:03.017
He's not gonna stop until we're all dead.

633
00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:05.733
- Who the fuck is he? Tell me right now!
- I don't know!

634
00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:08.293
The fuck you don't!
You grew up here! The sheriff said so!

635
00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:14.889
Now you better get us the fuck out of here
before that freak comes back.

636
00:49:15.019 --> 00:49:16.577
Fuck him. We don't need him anymore.

637
00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:19.008
You kill me,
and you're on your own- lost.

638
00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:21.334
- Maybe I don't give a shit.
- He doesn't know anything!

639
00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:22.858
Can't you see that?

640
00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:26.051
Just wait a minute.
If you kill him now, we are fucked.

641
00:49:26.179 --> 00:49:28.409
Okay? We have no idea
where we're going...

642
00:49:28.539 --> 00:49:32.168
with some crazy hick out there
trying to pick us all off one by one.

643
00:49:35.899 --> 00:49:37.252
No.

644
00:49:38.819 --> 00:49:40.298
Enough. Come on.

645
00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:43.976
Now, you don't want to see me angry.

646
00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:48.858
Now, you get me to that station-
and a phone, you hear?

647
00:49:51.899 --> 00:49:53.855
No!

648
00:49:53.979 --> 00:49:59.053
Help! Stop! Stop! God!

649
00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:16.217
I need a rest.

650
00:50:16.899 --> 00:50:19.777
Get the fuck up.
We gotta keep moving.

651
00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:24.292
Get up, both of you.

652
00:50:24.419 --> 00:50:26.330
The money's slowing us down.
We gotta lose it.

653
00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:27.448
No way.

654
00:50:27.579 --> 00:50:29.570
They'll be looking for us
in a couple of hours.

655
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:32.532
If we don't show up at Hazelton,
the FBI, US Marshals...

656
00:50:32.659 --> 00:50:35.093
and every law officer in West Virginia
is gonna be hunting you.

657
00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:38.177
Brandon's right. If you want to get away,
you need to move quicker.

658
00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:40.608
- Dump the money.
- Now you listen to me.

659
00:50:40.739 --> 00:50:45.255
We move now with the cash,
or we all wait here and die.

660
00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:47.415
She's the one who's slowin' us down.

661
00:50:49.859 --> 00:50:51.338
Be cool.

662
00:50:52.499 --> 00:50:54.171
Be cool.

663
00:50:54.299 --> 00:50:56.893
She's a nice piece of ass though.

664
00:50:57.019 --> 00:51:00.409
Let's just pass her around,
then pop her in the head...

665
00:51:00.539 --> 00:51:02.769
and get the fuck out of-

666
00:51:08.179 --> 00:51:10.170
I'm gonna kill you, you fuckin' bitch!

667
00:51:11.779 --> 00:51:13.178
Not just yet.

668
00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:17.010
Now be cool. Stay calm.

669
00:51:17.139 --> 00:51:18.777
I got this in hand.

670
00:51:21.139 --> 00:51:22.891
Be cool. All right?

671
00:51:24.379 --> 00:51:26.847
Now, you just chill the fuck out.

672
00:51:26.979 --> 00:51:28.458
You're dead, bitch.

673
00:51:28.579 --> 00:51:30.137
We're all dead, asshole!

674
00:51:30.259 --> 00:51:33.376
Give me my gun back.

675
00:51:33.499 --> 00:51:36.696
Looks like you got some
impulse-control issues there, Floyd.

676
00:51:36.819 --> 00:51:38.377
I don't think so.

677
00:51:38.499 --> 00:51:41.491
You having all three guns does us no good
if that freak comes after us again.

678
00:51:43.259 --> 00:51:46.137
Then that's just a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

679
00:51:48.699 --> 00:51:51.816
They're gonna start lookin' for us soon.
There'll be a full search by morning.

680
00:51:51.939 --> 00:51:54.169
- If we make it till then.
- We'll make it.

681
00:51:54.299 --> 00:51:56.767
These guys don't look like
they're just gonna let you go.

682
00:51:59.299 --> 00:52:01.733
Why haven't they killed you already?

683
00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:03.292
They need me.

684
00:52:03.419 --> 00:52:05.296
And what happens when
they don't need you anymore?

685
00:52:05.419 --> 00:52:07.091
I'm not planning on finding out.

686
00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:09.210
There should be a radio
and cell phone at the watchtower.

687
00:52:09.339 --> 00:52:11.807
- I'll call for help once we're there.
- How will you keep this lot under control?

688
00:52:11.939 --> 00:52:14.737
There's a ladder.
Only one person can climb up at a time.

689
00:52:14.859 --> 00:52:17.771
It's 7 5 feet straight up
and through a trapdoor.

690
00:52:17.899 --> 00:52:20.652
Each station has a gun hidden in it,
and I know where they keep it.

691
00:52:20.779 --> 00:52:22.929
It's a tight space.
I can ambush Chavez when we're up there.

692
00:52:24.419 --> 00:52:25.932
I just want to go home.

693
00:52:29.059 --> 00:52:32.096
It'll be okay, Alex.
I'll get you out of this.

694
00:53:06.435 --> 00:53:08.266
Walkin' a little slow there,
aren't you, Floyd?

695
00:53:08.395 --> 00:53:10.431
She hurt you that bad?

696
00:53:12.635 --> 00:53:13.545
Die, bitch!

697
00:53:17.035 --> 00:53:18.229
Come on.

698
00:53:39.755 --> 00:53:42.667
<i>Sheriff Carver calling Deputy Lane.</i>
<i>Come in. Over.</i>

699
00:53:42.795 --> 00:53:45.468
<i>Ally, this is Calvin. Come in. Over.</i>

700
00:53:45.595 --> 00:53:47.870
<i>County Dispatch, this is Sheriff Carver.</i>

701
00:53:47.995 --> 00:53:50.748
<i>- I want to report an emergency. Over.</i>
<i>- Go, Sheriff.</i>

702
00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:53.230
The custody bus
from Grafton Penitentiary has crashed...

703
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.915
off the old mill road
near mile marker 37.

704
00:53:56.035 --> 00:53:59.107
I'm goin' in to take a look around.
Carver out.

705
00:54:07.515 --> 00:54:09.665
<i>- Dispatch, this is Carver.</i>
<i>- Come in, Sheriff.</i>

706
00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:11.228
<i>There is no one on board.</i>

707
00:54:11.355 --> 00:54:12.993
Gonna see if I can track them.

708
00:54:13.115 --> 00:54:15.675
- Carver out.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

709
00:54:21.595 --> 00:54:23.472
Come on. Let's go.

710
00:54:51.595 --> 00:54:53.233
All right. Stop. He's had enough.

711
00:54:53.355 --> 00:54:55.425
I say when the Nazi bastard's
had enough!

712
00:55:01.395 --> 00:55:03.386
- Now, which way did they go?
- I don't know.

713
00:55:03.515 --> 00:55:05.346
I didn't see 'em go.

714
00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:07.628
Come on.

715
00:55:07.755 --> 00:55:10.189
Well, what do we do with him?

716
00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:12.670
Fuck him. Leave him.

717
00:55:15.275 --> 00:55:17.231
Nate...

718
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:18.913
I can't run anymore.

719
00:55:21.035 --> 00:55:22.514
I just need a minute.

720
00:55:22.635 --> 00:55:24.466
We need to keep moving.

721
00:55:25.835 --> 00:55:28.508
We just have to make it a few more hours,
and then we'll be fine.

722
00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:30.944
The police are coming. You can do this.

723
00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.074
Listen, Chavez.

724
00:55:38.155 --> 00:55:39.907
You can't get out of here alone.

725
00:55:40.035 --> 00:55:41.991
You know that, right?

726
00:55:42.115 --> 00:55:43.309
I'll be fine.

727
00:55:43.435 --> 00:55:46.586
- I can get you out of these woods.
- So, what do you want?

728
00:55:46.715 --> 00:55:47.704
A fair deal.

729
00:55:49.315 --> 00:55:51.590
- How much?
- No.

730
00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.865
I don't want the money. I don't need it.

731
00:55:53.995 --> 00:55:56.509
But you gotta promise me that you'll
let me go when your boys show up.

732
00:55:56.635 --> 00:55:57.750
Fine.

733
00:55:59.395 --> 00:56:01.625
And I also need one of those guns.

734
00:56:01.755 --> 00:56:03.473
Why should I give you a gun?

735
00:56:03.595 --> 00:56:07.383
Because whatever's hunting us is gonna
continue hunting us till we're both dead.

736
00:56:07.515 --> 00:56:10.268
It's simple tactical strategy.
Two gunners are better than one.

737
00:56:11.155 --> 00:56:12.634
And why should I trust you?

738
00:56:14.195 --> 00:56:15.674
Why would I fuck you?

739
00:56:16.715 --> 00:56:18.512
I helped you with Floyd, didn't I?

740
00:56:18.635 --> 00:56:21.229
Well, I didn't run.

741
00:57:48.915 --> 00:57:51.270
Where will you take them, Nate?

742
00:57:54.515 --> 00:57:56.631
I'm too old for this shit.

743
00:58:07.555 --> 00:58:09.113
Come on.

744
00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:11.749
We gotta go. We're not far now.

745
00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:18.594
We gotta move.

746
00:58:18.715 --> 00:58:20.114
We gotta keep moving.

747
00:58:20.235 --> 00:58:22.703
- I can't go on anymore.
- Come on.

748
00:58:23.395 --> 00:58:24.669
Over there.

749
00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:30.430
Okay. Let's leave the bags down over here.
Come on.

750
00:58:32.995 --> 00:58:34.872
We'll come back for them later.

751
00:58:43.235 --> 00:58:44.827
You shouldn't have run.

752
00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:46.513
Stop it! Stop it!

753
00:58:48.115 --> 00:58:49.992
Shut the fuck up!

754
00:58:50.115 --> 00:58:51.468
This is all your fault!

755
00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:54.189
- Maybe I should end you first!
- That's not gonna get us anywhere.

756
00:58:54.315 --> 00:58:57.307
- It gets the bitch out of the way though!
- The watchtower's just right over the hill.

757
00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:01.871
You've been leading us
in circles all night.

758
00:59:01.995 --> 00:59:03.951
Why should I believe you now?

759
00:59:04.075 --> 00:59:07.784
It's just over the hill- right there.
I swear.

760
00:59:07.915 --> 00:59:10.793
It'll take two minutes to find out. Please.

761
00:59:10.915 --> 00:59:12.507
Get this bitch up!

762
00:59:17.955 --> 00:59:19.593
Move.

763
00:59:41.915 --> 00:59:43.587
This is it?

764
00:59:43.715 --> 00:59:45.706
A bunch of fuckin' charcoal?

765
00:59:46.915 --> 00:59:49.554
- It must've been burned down.
- No shit.

766
00:59:49.675 --> 00:59:51.233
So now what?

767
00:59:51.355 --> 00:59:54.711
I don't know. This is the only place
I knew of that had a radio.

768
00:59:56.875 --> 00:59:58.911
You've been fuckin'
with me the whole time, haven't you?

769
00:59:59.035 --> 01:00:01.310
- No.
- Fuck you. You're a liar!

770
01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.268
He's not lying. Nate thought
the tower was gonna be here.

771
01:00:04.395 --> 01:00:07.068
We were gonna barricade ourselves in
and call for help.

772
01:00:07.195 --> 01:00:08.787
Let's just keep moving, all right?

773
01:00:08.915 --> 01:00:11.145
It's gotta be at least
3:00 or 4:00 a.m. by now.

774
01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.948
- We could go northeast.
- I've had enough of your bullshit.

775
01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:17.753
Get on your fuckin' knees!
Get on your fuckin' knees!

776
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.627
There's a small town 10 miles past the river.

777
01:00:19.755 --> 01:00:22.906
- I'll take you there.
- Fuck you. Say good-bye, asshole.

778
01:00:23.035 --> 01:00:24.912
- Think about this, Chavez.
- He's out there.

779
01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:26.434
What?

780
01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:30.026
I can feel him.

781
01:00:30.155 --> 01:00:33.067
He's been following us. He's close.

782
01:00:42.795 --> 01:00:43.944
I warned you.

783
01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:51.583
Get it off me!
Get this fucking dog off me!

784
01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:53.945
Drop the gun! Down, boy!

785
01:00:54.075 --> 01:00:56.191
- Get the dog off me!
- Take his guns, Nate.

786
01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:04.832
Are you okay?

787
01:01:04.955 --> 01:01:07.753
I'm fine, Sheriff.
Just really glad to see you.

788
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:10.594
When you didn't answer your cell,
I came looking.

789
01:01:10.715 --> 01:01:13.275
- There are others out there.
- How many?

790
01:01:13.395 --> 01:01:17.183
Don't know. At least one other prisoner
and some freak hillbilly local.

791
01:01:17.315 --> 01:01:18.987
Hillbilly?

792
01:01:19.115 --> 01:01:20.594
That can't be.

793
01:01:20.715 --> 01:01:24.071
Please. Let's just get out of here.

794
01:01:24.195 --> 01:01:26.948
Okay. Come on.

795
01:01:27.075 --> 01:01:28.428
Let's move it up there.

796
01:01:28.555 --> 01:01:32.070
Hey, you, come on.
Move your ass. Get up.

797
01:01:32.195 --> 01:01:33.787
Come on! Move it!

798
01:01:33.915 --> 01:01:36.475
Move it,
you son of a bitch! Move!

799
01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:39.394
Come on, honey.

800
01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:44.427
He's close. He's really close.

801
01:01:44.555 --> 01:01:45.829
Who is?

802
01:01:45.955 --> 01:01:47.866
He's a fucking monster.

803
01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.748
Please. Please.
I just want to get home.

804
01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:54.311
Oh, all right.
Just calm down, little lady.

805
01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.029
If you think you're
moving out of this forest...

806
01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.749
without going back for the cash,
you're fuckin' wrong.

807
01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.513
Now move. Move.

808
01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:22.390
Jackpot.

809
01:02:23.315 --> 01:02:26.512
Chavez, you stupid son of a bitch.

810
01:02:43.755 --> 01:02:46.588
This is where the sheriff
reported the bus crash.

811
01:02:46.715 --> 01:02:49.866
On foot in this terrain,
they should be within this perimeter.

812
01:02:49.995 --> 01:02:53.032
I want it approached from all sides,
and we'll work our way in.

813
01:02:53.155 --> 01:02:54.713
When is the air support getting here?

814
01:02:54.835 --> 01:02:57.429
They're in the air.
They should be here within the hour.

815
01:02:57.555 --> 01:03:00.547
Gentlemen, we have a man out there.

816
01:03:00.675 --> 01:03:02.631
I want all precautions taken.

817
01:03:03.795 --> 01:03:05.626
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

818
01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:14.347
Where's my bags?

819
01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:16.033
Are you sure this was the spot?

820
01:03:16.155 --> 01:03:18.225
Yes, this was the spot.

821
01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:21.233
Now where's
my goddamn fuckin' money?

822
01:03:21.355 --> 01:03:22.549
It's Floyd.

823
01:03:22.675 --> 01:03:24.870
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

824
01:03:24.995 --> 01:03:28.431
No. I'm gonna skin him alive first...

825
01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.193
then I'm gonna fucking kill him!

826
01:03:30.315 --> 01:03:31.828
Shit!

827
01:03:44.915 --> 01:03:47.634
You- You stay here and you guard them.

828
01:03:47.755 --> 01:03:51.464
You hear?
You don't move! Don't move!

829
01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:55.871
That'll teach that motherfucker!

830
01:03:56.875 --> 01:04:00.185
Who's laughin' now,
you Mexican piece of shit?

831
01:04:04.795 --> 01:04:06.751
Let me go, Brandon.

832
01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:09.384
I can't.

833
01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:12.511
I'm sorry. If I do, he'll kill me.

834
01:04:12.635 --> 01:04:14.910
- Then let her go.
- I'm not leaving you.

835
01:04:16.195 --> 01:04:17.548
I see you!

836
01:04:17.675 --> 01:04:20.428
You cocksucker! You're fuckin' dead!

837
01:04:21.515 --> 01:04:22.834
Fuck you, Chavez!

838
01:04:22.955 --> 01:04:26.231
You can pick it up!
You can pick it all up!

839
01:04:28.475 --> 01:04:30.352
You're fuckin' dead!

840
01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:33.035
- Dead!
- Fuck you!

841
01:04:41.435 --> 01:04:42.914
Come on.

842
01:04:43.035 --> 01:04:45.868
Come on out, you hick motherfucker!

843
01:04:45.995 --> 01:04:48.270
I'll kill you with my bare fuckin' hands!

844
01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:54.032
Shit! My money!

845
01:04:59.915 --> 01:05:01.871
- My God.
- What do we do now?

846
01:05:01.995 --> 01:05:04.714
We die... if we don't start fighting back.

847
01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:09.830
Let's head towards that town!
Come on! Move! Let's go!

848
01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:29.511
- It's gotta be a trap.
- Yeah, but why would he think it'd work?

849
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.944
What the fuck does he want?

850
01:05:32.075 --> 01:05:35.465
You hear that? You hick-ass motherfucker!

851
01:05:35.595 --> 01:05:36.994
What do you want?

852
01:05:38.795 --> 01:05:41.707
Tell me, you son of a bitch.
Can't be the money.

853
01:05:41.835 --> 01:05:44.224
You've already fuckin' burnt that!

854
01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:46.186
What do you want?

855
01:05:49.995 --> 01:05:53.067
Okay. You want to fuck with me?

856
01:05:53.195 --> 01:05:55.345
- Come here. Come here.
- What the hell are you doing?

857
01:05:57.515 --> 01:06:00.075
Come on, fuck-stick!
A head for a head!

858
01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:02.186
There she is. Take hers.

859
01:06:02.315 --> 01:06:05.068
Come on, you bastard!
It's what you want, isn't it?

860
01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.951
Take the bitch!

861
01:06:08.075 --> 01:06:08.985
Run.

862
01:06:10.155 --> 01:06:11.190
No!

863
01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:15.791
- Alex!
- Nate!

864
01:06:15.915 --> 01:06:17.871
- Alex!
- Stop! No!

865
01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:19.314
Alex!

866
01:06:21.355 --> 01:06:23.027
Alex!

867
01:06:24.795 --> 01:06:26.274
You son of a bitch!
We've got to go after her.

868
01:06:26.395 --> 01:06:27.430
No.

869
01:06:27.555 --> 01:06:30.069
He's gone. She's gone. We're moving on.

870
01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:32.550
- I'm not gonna leave her to him.
- I said, we're moving on.

871
01:06:32.675 --> 01:06:34.791
Now lead us out of here.

872
01:06:34.915 --> 01:06:35.904
No.

873
01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.991
This is something
I should have done a long time ago...

874
01:06:42.115 --> 01:06:43.548
you stupid son of a bitch.

875
01:06:48.075 --> 01:06:49.110
Here.

876
01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:51.990
I'm sorry I let it go this far.

877
01:06:53.035 --> 01:06:55.913
What are you gonna do?

878
01:06:56.035 --> 01:06:57.832
Try and reach that town.

879
01:06:57.955 --> 01:06:59.673
Good luck.

880
01:06:59.795 --> 01:07:01.433
Get her back, Nate.

881
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:05.114
Should we kill him?

882
01:07:06.435 --> 01:07:09.745
I'm not a murderer,
Brandon, and neither are you.

883
01:07:16.835 --> 01:07:18.473
Somebody!

884
01:07:18.595 --> 01:07:21.189
Help me!

885
01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:25.711
Help me!

886
01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:28.110
Please let me go!

887
01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:32.066
Help me!

888
01:07:33.355 --> 01:07:34.868
Help me!

889
01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:08.911
Nate! Nate!

890
01:08:09.995 --> 01:08:11.348
Help me!

891
01:08:11.475 --> 01:08:13.943
Please let me go!

892
01:08:17.235 --> 01:08:18.554
Nate!

893
01:08:18.675 --> 01:08:19.710
Nate!

894
01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:22.552
Please, somebody!

895
01:08:27.235 --> 01:08:29.032
Help me!

896
01:08:37.995 --> 01:08:40.270
Leon. Hey, boy.

897
01:08:40.395 --> 01:08:42.989
Come here, boy. Come here.

898
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:48.833
Find her, Leon. Find Alex, okay?

899
01:08:48.955 --> 01:08:50.104
Go, boy.

900
01:09:06.635 --> 01:09:08.273
Help me.

901
01:09:11.275 --> 01:09:13.072
Help me.

902
01:09:53.795 --> 01:09:56.673
No!

903
01:09:59.275 --> 01:10:01.311
No! No!

904
01:10:37.595 --> 01:10:39.472
You made a bad choice, army boy.

905
01:10:48.595 --> 01:10:50.506
Hey! Hey!

906
01:10:50.635 --> 01:10:53.468
Here! I'm here!

907
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:56.870
Hey!

908
01:11:01.835 --> 01:11:03.188
There you are.

909
01:11:03.315 --> 01:11:05.192
I've been looking for you.

910
01:11:07.755 --> 01:11:09.746
Bring it, you motherfucker!

911
01:11:10.635 --> 01:11:13.229
What's the matter,
you cracker-ass fuckin' freak?

912
01:11:13.355 --> 01:11:14.834
Scared of losing your head?

913
01:12:04.955 --> 01:12:06.707
Is that it?

914
01:12:08.635 --> 01:12:10.034
That all you got?

915
01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:22.428
Now you're dead!
I'm gonna kill you now!

916
01:12:25.195 --> 01:12:26.867
You're dead.

917
01:12:43.555 --> 01:12:44.954
God!

918
01:12:57.235 --> 01:12:59.112
Looks like we're even.

919
01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:07.423
Shit.

920
01:13:16.275 --> 01:13:17.674
Ain't so tough.

921
01:14:29.515 --> 01:14:31.073
Yeah. Good boy.

922
01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.111
- Where is he?
- I don't know.Just hurry.

923
01:16:24.315 --> 01:16:26.545
Nate, she's dead.

924
01:17:35.915 --> 01:17:38.065
No!

925
01:17:59.795 --> 01:18:01.308
Is he dead?

926
01:18:05.035 --> 01:18:06.388
Yeah.

927
01:18:11.635 --> 01:18:13.227
Let's get out of here.

928
01:19:06.755 --> 01:19:07.949
Look.

929
01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:10.553
It's almost dawn.

930
01:19:12.195 --> 01:19:13.992
We made it through the night.

931
01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.433
Thank you, Nate...

932
01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.786
for coming back for me.

933
01:19:33.355 --> 01:19:34.913
Oh, my God!

934
01:19:36.275 --> 01:19:38.152
Oh, God, Nate!

935
01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:48.550
Oh, God.

936
01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.868
Get the shotgun!

937
01:20:04.555 --> 01:20:05.988
Nate!

938
01:20:50.075 --> 01:20:51.110
Alex!

939
01:20:51.235 --> 01:20:52.714
Alex!

940
01:20:52.835 --> 01:20:54.826
We gotta get out of here. Alex!

941
01:20:59.275 --> 01:21:01.709
- It's me.
- Get Alex first.

942
01:21:08.635 --> 01:21:10.034
I got you.

943
01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:29.904
My leg.

944
01:21:31.835 --> 01:21:33.632
Give me your arm.

945
01:22:04.395 --> 01:22:06.909
It's okay. He's gone.

946
01:22:42.595 --> 01:22:44.631
Funny...

947
01:22:44.755 --> 01:22:46.154
All that money...

948
01:22:48.555 --> 01:22:50.147
up in flames.

949
01:22:56.435 --> 01:22:58.630
You really didn't kill
that bartender, did you?

950
01:23:00.315 --> 01:23:01.464
No.

951
01:23:05.795 --> 01:23:07.308
So, now what?

952
01:23:08.915 --> 01:23:10.473
You didn't make it.

953
01:23:13.675 --> 01:23:15.506
Nobody goes looking for a dead con.

954
01:23:16.555 --> 01:23:18.147
You'd do that for me?

955
01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:21.754
Just stay out of trouble.

956
01:23:23.555 --> 01:23:24.954
I will.

957
01:23:26.755 --> 01:23:28.154
Trust me.

958
01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:12.467
Is it them?

959
01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:59.785
Miami, South Beach...

960
01:24:59.915 --> 01:25:01.712
surrounded by pussy.

961
01:25:04.235 --> 01:25:06.112
I'm gonna miss you, Walter.

962
01:25:21.475 --> 01:25:23.466
Like I said...

963
01:25:23.595 --> 01:25:25.506
never trust a con.

964
01:28:13.395 --> 01:28:14.350
