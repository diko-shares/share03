Uh, well, we didit.

Uh, we raised the $25,000.

So now we can bring the genius
Samnang out ofCambodia...

68
00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:40.058
and bring him here
to study at Westport.

69
00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:46.459
Speaking ofwhich, um,
Samnang sent us a new tape.

70
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:48.469

00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:52.005

75
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:03.960
- Areyou excited?
- Yeah!

76
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.131
I told my class that I'm coming to America.
Theywere sad.

77
00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.140
- But Iam so happy.
- I want to bang you!

78
00:07:14.242 --> 00:07:17.175
- Go, Cougars!
- Yeah!

79
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.901
How do theyskip class
everydayandgo to the beach?

80
00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.635
Because they just don't care.

81
00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:48.473
Let's go with 'em.

82
00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:52.313
- Seriously. Let's just do it.
- Why?

83
00:07:52.416 --> 00:07:55.406
Because, I mean,
we never do anything.

84
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:58.509
I mean, we're graduating.
We should be going nuts right now.

85
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.136
- Let's just do something.
- I am doing something. I'm going to class.

86
00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:06.180
Klitz, you already got intoYale.
I mean, it doesn't matter anymore.

87
00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:09.511
- Yeah, Klitz, you pussy.
- Well, why don'tyou go?

88
00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:13.207

89
00:08:13.316 --> 00:08:15.284

- Yeah.

90
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:19.847
You know what?
You guys are fags.

91
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:26.817
Everyone to the beach!

92
00:08:26.922 --> 00:08:30.287
Let's go!
Lock 'em and load 'em, dude.

93
00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:36.174
Fuck it.

94
00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:56.825
Personal power.

95
00:08:56.927 --> 00:09:00.122
Personal power means
the ability to act...

96
00:09:00.228 --> 00:09:02.456
the ability to take action.

97
00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:04.523
There are three steps
to personal power...

98
00:09:04.623 --> 00:09:07.351
that are necessary
to produce the results.

99
00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:11.948
And here 's number one step
to personal power.

100
00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:14.822
When you wake up
feeling truly lethargic--

101
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.755
Oh, shit.

102
00:09:35.234 --> 00:09:38.820
F--

103
00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:50.657
Hey! Pull it over!

104
00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:54.330
Pull it over! Pull over!

105
00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:26.834
Oh, you're home early.

106
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.170
Yeah, I postponed yearbook.
I gotta work on my speech.

107
00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:32.970
- Mr. President.
- Mrs. Peterson.

108
00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:34.940
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thankyou.

109
00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:38.876
Congratulations. Georgetown. Wow.
You must be flyin'.

110
00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.700
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

111
00:10:41.806 --> 00:10:43.635
What's the speech
you're working on?

112
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.969
It's for this scholarship I need to get
so I can actually go to Georgetown.

113
00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:49.632
It's, um--
It's pretty expensive.

114
00:10:49.742 --> 00:10:53.369
Yeah, what kindofscholarship is it?
I mean, what do theygive it for?

115
00:10:53.477 --> 00:10:57.377
It's for the student who best demonstrates,
um, moral fiber.

116
00:10:57.479 --> 00:10:59.468
Ah, moral fiber.
Well, that's--

117
00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:02.569
- Oh, I'm sureyou'll get it.
- Thanks. I hope so.

118
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.739
There's some stiff competition,
and they only pick one of us.

119
00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:10.305
So I'll just, uh, have to blow them away
with my speech.

120
00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:17.178
Okay. So, why do I deserve
this scholarship?

121
00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:20.110
Well, John F. Kennedy
once said...

122
00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:22.737
"Ask not whatyour country
can do foryou...

123
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:24.839
but whatyou can do for--"

124
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.589
I'm just saying that
this girl was unbelievable.

125
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.988
I mean, she was
like this angel.

126
00:12:07.092 --> 00:12:10.787
I mean, she had this smile.
I mean, you should have seen it.

127
00:12:10.894 --> 00:12:14.223
- So, did you bang her?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. I banged her.

128
00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:17.658
- That's what a man does. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay, Eli.

129
00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:19.723
Good.

130
00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.789
Whoa.

131
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.482
Oh, my God.
She's so hot.

132
00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:27.558
- What channel, dude?
- No. The-- The girl next door.

133
00:12:27.658 --> 00:12:30.819
- I can see herthrough my window.
- How's the rack?

134
00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:33.292
God, who is this girl?

135
00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:35.327
- How's the rack?
- Hold on. Relax.

136
00:12:35.429 --> 00:12:38.055
No, dude. You relax.
Be a man and go over there.

137
00:12:38.163 --> 00:12:40.131
Okay. Saywhat?

138
00:12:40.232 --> 00:12:42.892
I don't know. Get offyour ass
and do something. Fuck!

139
00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.964
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What?

140
00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:53.029
Hey, dude, seriously,
I told you. It really freaks me out...

141
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.562
- when you watch that
whileyou're talking to me.

142
00:12:55.663 --> 00:12:57.595
Just learn to like it.

143
00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.961
Oh, my God.

144
00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:08.466
What? Matt, what?

145
00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:10.727
Matt.

146
00:13:14.804 --> 00:13:16.702
Dude, what the fuck?

147
00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:39.131
Shit.

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:11.102
- Yes?

149
00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:15.178
- Dan.

150
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.246

You know Mrs. Clark

Wel l, Danielle's her niece.

157
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.886
Danielle just told us
something very interesting.

158
00:14:52.988 --> 00:14:56.854
Mrs. Clark is inAfrica
fortwo weeks with her church group.

159
00:14:56.956 --> 00:14:58.888

160
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.145

00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:07.551
Why don't you

163
00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:20.049
Such a long road, you know.

164
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.628
Uh, what are we doing?

165
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:33.161

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:28.263
Uh, no.

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.495
No. Never gonna happen.

00:16:35.605 --> 00:16:37.835

It's a little funny.

196
00:17:59.451 --> 00:18:03.076
So, what else do you do

Okay. We can figure this out.
You just-- You need a girl.

221
00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:35.533
What kind of girl?

222
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:38.890
Definitely someone cute.

223
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:41.194
Definitely.

224
00:19:41.302 --> 00:19:43.429
Someone who can
make him laugh.

225
00:19:47.005 --> 00:19:49.403
But he also needs
someone who's gonna push him.

226
00:19:50.705 --> 00:19:52.605
Someone who's gonna
make him do things...

227
00:19:52.707 --> 00:19:54.764
he never thought
he could do.

228
00:19:54.874 --> 00:19:58.460
Like stripping
in the middle ofthe street?

229
00:20:21.177 --> 00:20:24.110
- Well, thanks for the ride.

230
00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:35.735
Well, um,

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:38.208
Good night.

232
00:20:42.046 --> 00:20:45.070

- "Good night"?

233
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.976
What areyou, gay?
I would have nailed her.

234
00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.547
- First ofall, you wouldn't have nailed her.
- Whatever, dude.

235
00:20:50.648 --> 00:20:54.707
And, you know, secondly, you know,
the vibe was not right.

236
00:20:54.817 --> 00:20:58.410
The vibe wasn't right?
Dude, she comes to your house,

237
00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:01.411
What does she have to do?
Sit on your face?

238
00:21:01.513 --> 00:21:03.775
- Ow.
- Come on, bitch!

239
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.778
Damn.

240
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.711
- Should have kissed her.
- You okay? Dude?

241
00:21:08.848 --> 00:21:10.941
All right. You all have
this graph, correct?

242
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.484
Good. Let's move along then.

243
00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:16.551
Now, it's a verysimple
equation here.

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.617
Can anybodygive me

245

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:35.382
Questions on this?

247
00:21:49.924 --> 00:21:52.948

That's SamnangSok.
He's this complete genius.

251
00:22:52.935 --> 00:22:56.423
So we raised all this money for him
to come here and study at our school.

252
00:22:56.535 --> 00:22:58.503
Who's we?

253

the next Einstein, you know.

Let's go.

257
00:23:20.738 --> 00:23:23.967

265
00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:16.605
Seriously. This is nuts.

266
00:24:26.984 --> 00:24:31.041
- Ooh, boxers.
- I always wear boxers.

267
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.118
You just caught me

268
00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:46.182
So...

269
00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:48.987

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:53.484
Uh, this is right up there.

271
00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:07.319
Oh, my God.

00:25:11.193 --> 00:25:13.093

Go, go.

279
00:25:48.968 --> 00:25:52.060
- Dude, I'm kind of uncomfortable
watching this with you.

280
00:25:52.169 --> 00:25:54.287
Dude, learn to like it.

Dude, I'm gonna do that little guy

Everybody out.
Let's move.

326
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:18.904
I said out, minions!

327
00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:22.636

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.802
Is everything, you know,
okay at home?

330
00:30:30.913 --> 00:30:33.209
All right. What?

331
00:30:33.314 --> 00:30:35.214
Perhaps you should
have a seat.

332
00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:39.078
- Perhaps you should bite me.
- Perhaps.

333
00:30:41.952 --> 00:30:43.850
Matthew...

334
00:30:43.952 --> 00:30:47.902

mixed-up world.

Crazy,
but, oh, so beautiful.

00:31:08.553 --> 00:31:11.679
Ooh, excellent, grasshopper.

337
00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:15.244
And now for the final task
ofyour training.

338
00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:22.412
You're gonna need a harder piece
ofwood than that, cowboy.

339
00:31:23.954 --> 00:31:26.682
- That's not her.
- Yeah, it is.

340
00:31:30.523 --> 00:31:32.489
Oh!

341
00:31:33.757 --> 00:31:36.815
Oh, no.

00:31:58.192 --> 00:32:01.250
- I know. I know.
- It's not funny. Seriously, get away from me.

347
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.658
- Dude, don't mess this up.
- Mess what up?

348
00:32:03.762 --> 00:32:05.728
Matt, she's
a porn star, okay?

349
00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:08.557
Take her to a motel room
and bang her like a beast.

350
00:32:08.663 --> 00:32:12.688
- Eli, I like this girl.
- And you can still like her

351
00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:17.357
Matt, I'm telling you, you're gonna
regret this. Whatwould J.F.K. do?

352
00:32:17.466 --> 00:32:19.366
You know
he'd tap that ass.

353
00:32:19.468 --> 00:32:21.866
- Eli, I'm never gonna see her again.
- You know what? Fine.

354
00:32:21.969 --> 00:32:23.935
- Fine.
- Fine!

355
00:32:24.069 --> 00:32:26.622
Goddamn it, Matt.
I swear to God...

356
00:32:26.729 --> 00:32:29.391
ifyou don't fuck her,
I'll kill myself!

357
00:32:29.498 --> 00:32:31.726
Matt, please, please, Matt!

358
00:32:31.832 --> 00:32:35.231
Fuck her for me!
For me!

359
00:32:47.404 --> 00:32:49.597
- Oh, Marci, you're so funny.
- Oh, thanks.

360
00:32:51.506 --> 00:32:53.938
I just saw you naked.

361
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.024
- What?
- Oh, don't worry, honey.

362
00:32:58.135 --> 00:33:00.294
- Let's see what else we have.
- What are you doin' here?

363
00:33:00.402 --> 00:33:03.528

364
00:33:03.637 --> 00:33:06.263

- That one's the best.

367
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.442
That's such a good one.

368
00:33:22.544 --> 00:33:24.637
- Here you go, Danielle.
- Oh, thanks.

369
00:33:30.316 --> 00:33:32.239
Mmm.

00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:34.969

371
00:33:35.075 --> 00:33:37.543
Ohh, who's your daddy.

372
00:33:37.644 --> 00:33:41.305
So, you were going to school
in Los Angeles?

373
00:33:41.412 --> 00:33:44.470
For a while. Uh, but then I started
working on other things.

374
00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.206
Oh. What kind ofthings?

375
00:33:47.314 --> 00:33:50.145
Let me showyou.

376
00:33:59.318 --> 00:34:00.979

377
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.708
- Areyou okay?
- Yeah. I don't know. I, um--

378
00:34:07.814 --> 00:34:10.078
I don't feel so good.

379
00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:12.877
Oh.

380
00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:16.483
What can I do
to makeyou feel better?

381
00:34:18.151 --> 00:34:21.084
Oh, yeah.

382
00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:33.989
I think I'm feeling
a lot better now.

383
00:34:34.091 --> 00:34:37.142
- Really? We can go out another night.
- No, we're going out tonight.

384
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:40.084
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

385
00:34:44.021 --> 00:34:46.988
- Look, I don't know ifl can do this.
- Yes, you can.

386
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:49.922
For tonight,
be the man.

387
00:34:50.025 --> 00:34:53.855
First off, act like
you don't even like her.

388
00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:56.483
- Hey.

389
00:34:56.592 --> 00:34:59.026
Second, get her drunk--

391
00:35:01.295 --> 00:35:03.989
That way the true porn star
will come out in her.

392
00:35:07.766 --> 00:35:10.781
Here. I, um--
I got us something.

393
00:35:14.059 --> 00:35:16.116

394
00:35:16.226 --> 00:35:18.353

- No. What?

395
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:23.454

- Like to rock?

396
00:35:23.563 --> 00:35:25.554

00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:31.859
That tells heryou came here

399
00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:37.435
What are we doing?

400
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.771
Just chillin'.

401
00:35:43.664 --> 00:35:45.653
Oh. Hey, look.

00:35:51.067 --> 00:35:55.058
Um, may-- maybe, uh,

404
00:35:57.236 --> 00:35:59.532
Okay.

405
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.672
Here it is.

406
00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.272
Wow.

407
00:36:27.575 --> 00:36:29.734
This is, uh--
This is really nice. Uh--

408
00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:34.640
TV, air conditioner.

409
00:36:34.743 --> 00:36:37.710
Got a little lamp there.

410
00:36:38.811 --> 00:36:41.505
Is that a Monet?

411
00:36:44.048 --> 00:36:45.982
What--

412
00:36:46.074 --> 00:36:48.040
What are you thinkin'?

413
00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:50.041
What are you thinking?

414
00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:54.343
I don't know.

415
00:37:04.314 --> 00:37:06.282
Do you want to fuck me?

416
00:37:08.549 --> 00:37:10.515
Um--

417
00:37:14.018 --> 00:37:15.986
Come here.

418
00:37:32.886 --> 00:37:34.852
How do you want me?

419
00:37:36.154 --> 00:37:38.120
Why are you doing this?

420
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:40.983
What?

421
00:37:41.088 --> 00:37:43.281
This.

422
00:37:45.324 --> 00:37:47.882
Isn't this whatyou want?

423
00:37:47.991 --> 00:37:50.960
To fuck a porn star
in a cheap motel room?

424
00:37:56.253 --> 00:37:58.517
So this is what
you think of me.

425
00:38:00.822 --> 00:38:02.788
- Danielle, wait. I'm sorry.
- Let me guess.

426
00:38:02.889 --> 00:38:06.482
Someone showed you a tape,
and you thought, "What the hell.

427
00:38:06.591 --> 00:38:08.650
- Right?
- Eli told me to do it.

428
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.692
Oh, now that's
a mature response.

429
00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:14.124
- Why didn'tyou just tell me?
- Because I didn't want to, okay?

430
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:19.887
Because I loved the way
you looked at me.

431
00:38:21.231 --> 00:38:23.665
God, doyou have
any idea how--

432
00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:28.259
Forget it.

433
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.383
- Holdon.
- Fuckyou.

434
00:38:51.768 --> 00:38:54.735
You're done.

435
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.728
Look, I'm-- I'm an idiot, okay?

436
00:39:20.838 --> 00:39:23.170
I saw the tape,
and I freaked out.

437
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.239
Hi. I'm comin' in.
Can-- Can I come in?

438
00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:30.800
Look, I--
I've just been crazy lately.

439
00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:33.462
I mean, this-- the whole scholarship thing,
you know?

440
00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:36.060
I mean, it's--
it's killing me, you know?

441
00:39:36.172 --> 00:39:39.071
But I'm not-- I'm not even
thinking about that.

442
00:39:39.173 --> 00:39:42.368
The only thing
I care about is you.

443
00:39:42.474 --> 00:39:46.668
You know? All I want is for us
to go back to normal again.

444
00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:49.710
It's a real nice place
you got here, "D."

445
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:53.368
I, um--

446
00:40:04.142 --> 00:40:07.041
Can we...

447
00:40:07.143 --> 00:40:10.042
- talk about this later?
- Yeah.

448
00:40:11.678 --> 00:40:13.166
Sure.

449
00:40:30.118 --> 00:40:32.086
I liked that.

450
00:40:32.187 --> 00:40:34.874
- What?
- What you said in there.

451
00:40:35.946 --> 00:40:37.641
Thanks.

452
00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:45.973
- Kelly.
- Oh. Matthew.

453
00:40:46.084 --> 00:40:48.052
Mm-hmm.

454
00:40:51.521 --> 00:40:54.249
- So you're friends with "D," huh?
- Yeah.

455
00:40:54.355 --> 00:40:57.584
Well, we're, um--
We're kind of going out.

456
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.519
Look atyou.

457
00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:05.989
You are a forest fire.

458
00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:08.415
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

459
00:41:08.519 --> 00:41:11.509
- You comin' with us?
- Where you goin'?

460
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.315
He can't.
He's got school tomorrow.

461
00:41:13.422 --> 00:41:17.186
No, no. I'm cool.
Like, where are we goin'?

462
00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:45.584
What can I get forya?

463
00:41:45.693 --> 00:41:47.591
Two Scotch rocks and, uh--

464
00:41:47.693 --> 00:41:51.525
Make it three. Actually, I'll have, uh--
a Long Island iced tea.

465
00:41:54.696 --> 00:41:56.391
So, what grade are you in, man?

466
00:41:56.498 --> 00:41:59.488
I'm a senior, but, uh,
I'm about to graduate.

467
00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:01.895
Congratulations.
What's next?

468
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.761
Georgetown, hopefully.

469
00:42:03.866 --> 00:42:05.857
Matthew wants to be
president.

470
00:42:05.968 --> 00:42:08.594
Really?
That's great, man.

471
00:42:08.702 --> 00:42:11.168
Yeah. How do--
How do you two know each other?

472
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.559
How do we know each other?

473
00:42:13.663 --> 00:42:15.654
We used to work together.

474
00:42:15.765 --> 00:42:18.231
So you're, like--
like, an actor?

475
00:42:18.332 --> 00:42:20.230
Hmm? No.

476
00:42:20.332 --> 00:42:23.925
Strictly producer.
But "D" and I also used to go out.

477
00:42:24.034 --> 00:42:25.934
Excuse me a sec.

478
00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.136
So you guys went out?

Thankyou.

480
00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:37.171

482
00:42:40.941 --> 00:42:43.339
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- Oh, nothing.

483
00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:45.699
It's-- It's fine.

484
00:42:45.804 --> 00:42:49.327
It's one of my favorites.

485
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:55.033
Hey. You got one for me?

486
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:06.675

moral fiber.

518
00:45:06.728 --> 00:45:09.593
So, who is this guy?
He's, like, a porn producer?

519
00:45:09.696 --> 00:45:11.596
Klitz, shut up.
Now, the strippers.

520
00:45:11.698 --> 00:45:15.029
When you were getting a lap dance,
were they cool with you grabbing their ass--

521
00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:18.191
Dude, oh, my-- oh, my God.
I'm trying to talk about Danielle.

522
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:20.529
Fine. Selfish bitch.

523
00:45:20.634 --> 00:45:24.261
Forteenagers,
sexual intercourse can be dangerous.

524
00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:28.456
Jesus, what hack made this?
I could make a better

525
00:45:28.565 --> 00:45:31.123
Why don't they
update this thing?

526
00:45:31.232 --> 00:45:33.494
Special events,
such as your senior prom...

527
00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:36.964
place added pressure
on young teens to lose theirvirginity...

528
00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:39.659
and also engage
in unprotected sex.

529
00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:45.333
- Hello.
- Hey, Bob.

530
00:45:45.436 --> 00:45:48.166
We're all going to the creek tonight.
It's gonna be a gas.

531
00:45:48.272 --> 00:45:51.569
- You're comin', right?
- I can't, guys.

532
00:45:52.873 --> 00:45:55.601
I have a baby now.

533
00:45:57.242 --> 00:45:59.435
Because of prom.

534
00:46:02.303 --> 00:46:04.203
What?

535
00:46:04.305 --> 00:46:06.362
Yeah, right.

536
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:08.631
You guys everthought about it?

537
00:46:08.738 --> 00:46:10.638
No.

538
00:46:12.974 --> 00:46:16.305
I just thinkyou guys would be really hot.
You girls are 18, right?

539
00:46:16.409 --> 00:46:18.841
- I am.
- I will be in a month.

540
00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:21.375
- Really? You ever been photographed?
- Yeah. A couple oftimes.

541
00:46:21.477 --> 00:46:24.002
Hey, you guys
know Matty?

542
00:46:24.113 --> 00:46:27.103
I hung with him last night.
Guy's the tits.

543
00:46:27.214 --> 00:46:30.873
- There's my man.
- How you doin'?

544
00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.498
What's up, fellas?

545
00:46:35.776 --> 00:46:37.935
Matty...

546
00:46:38.043 --> 00:46:41.442
you didn't tell me you got some
serious burners at your school here.

547
00:46:41.544 --> 00:46:43.307
- Shut up.
- Don't say that.

548
00:46:43.413 --> 00:46:45.470
Hey, you know who's got
the killer bud?

549
00:46:46.614 --> 00:46:49.206
This fucker right here.

550
00:46:49.315 --> 00:46:52.874
What areyou talking about?

551
00:46:52.983 --> 00:46:55.006
- Yeah, come on.
- Yeah. You have some?

552
00:46:55.117 --> 00:46:57.481
- Uh--
- Yeah. Come on.

553
00:46:57.584 --> 00:47:00.483
- Holy shit!
- You guys should party.

554
00:47:00.585 --> 00:47:02.815
- Can I--
- All right. We're out.

555
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.641
- Uh, holdon a sec.
- Hey. Whereyou going?

556
00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:07.645
- Got things to do, ladies.
- So, you wanna hang out?

557
00:47:07.747 --> 00:47:11.112
- Hop in, fellas.
- Aren't you gonna photograph us?

558
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.875
- Always leave 'em wantin' more.
- Watch it!

559
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:36.185
Man, there is some talent here.

560
00:47:37.728 --> 00:47:40.709
You get those girls together
with those ass-bags right there...

561
00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.845
shoot 'em humping at, like,
a football game or at a prom...

562
00:47:44.956 --> 00:47:47.946
that video would sel l.
Fuck, I 'm good!

563
00:47:48.057 --> 00:47:49.955
How do I get these ideas?

564
00:47:50.057 --> 00:47:51.957
It's like a gift,
you know.

565
00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:53.991
It's like
I can't control it.

566
00:47:58.194 --> 00:48:01.650
So, what are we doin', men?

567
00:48:01.762 --> 00:48:03.728
Right. I need to transfer that.

568
00:48:05.164 --> 00:48:07.426
You know, you really didn't
have to come with me.

569
00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:11.288
Ah, it's cool.
I like runnin' errands.

570
00:48:13.226 --> 00:48:16.523
Soyou raised 25 G's just to
bring this Chinese guy over.

571
00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.684
He's Cambodian.

572
00:48:18.794 --> 00:48:22.091
Okay, so that's
25,000 total...

573
00:48:22.195 --> 00:48:25.287
deposited into the Operation
Get Samnang account.

574
00:48:25.396 --> 00:48:27.830
Hey, soyou raised
all the moneyyou needed.

575
00:48:27.932 --> 00:48:29.830
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

576
00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:32.125
So, is this Samnang
really as smart as they say?

577
00:48:32.233 --> 00:48:35.564
Well, he did teach himself calculus
without even using his textbook.

578
00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:37.396
- So--
- Wow.

579
00:48:37.503 --> 00:48:40.902
Those crazy little fuckers, man.
They sure know their numbers.

580
00:48:43.498 --> 00:48:47.125
Uh, Jeannie, this is my, um--
This is my student adviser.

581
00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:49.722
Oh. You're Mr. Salinger?

582
00:48:49.833 --> 00:48:53.494
Just here to make sure
everything's up to par. Wow.

583
00:48:53.602 --> 00:48:56.797
- What?
- I love those earrings.

584
00:48:58.403 --> 00:49:00.995
- Oh, thankyou.
- Theyreallycomplementyour coloring.

585
00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:03.332
Thanks. I just
got back from Cabo.

586
00:49:03.437 --> 00:49:05.699
- Did you?
- Yeah.

587
00:49:05.804 --> 00:49:09.033
Okay. Well, uh, we gotta go.
Thanks, Jeannie.

588
00:49:09.139 --> 00:49:11.369
- Man, what were you doing?
- Yeah.

589
00:49:11.475 --> 00:49:13.634
There's a bar under there,
sit with other people.

590
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:16.038
- You have been there. See? I knew.
- No. No.

591
00:49:16.142 --> 00:49:18.897
- I couldshowyou around.
- This guy's unbelievable.

592
00:49:19.003 --> 00:49:20.903
You.

593
00:49:29.774 --> 00:49:32.502
- Where you guys goin'?
- Vegas, baby.

594
00:49:32.608 --> 00:49:37.634
We got the convention.
Gotta press the flesh, meet the fans.

595
00:49:37.745 --> 00:49:39.802
So that's it?
You're just goin' back?

596
00:49:40.846 --> 00:49:42.812
I don't belong here.

597
00:49:42.912 --> 00:49:46.471
What doyou-- What doyou mean?
What about starting over?

598
00:49:46.581 --> 00:49:48.547
This is what I am.

599
00:49:50.843 --> 00:49:53.969
Allright, "D."
Let's roll.

600
00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:14.276
Dude, it's not your fault.

601
00:50:14.384 --> 00:50:16.375
No, it is my fault.

602
00:50:16.486 --> 00:50:19.681
If I hadn't been such a dick
and taken her to that motel room--

603
00:50:19.787 --> 00:50:22.576
Yeah, that was a little forward,
don'tyou think?

604
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.648
- Dude.
- What?

605
00:50:25.749 --> 00:50:28.147
Matt, the point is
she made her decision.

606
00:50:28.249 --> 00:50:30.238
There's nothin'
you can do about it now.

607
00:50:35.686 --> 00:50:37.652
Yeah, there is.

608
00:50:44.956 --> 00:50:46.854
- Hey, hey, Dad.
- Mom, don't wait up.

609
00:50:46.956 --> 00:50:48.947
- I'm gonna be late.
- I'll watch it with you tomorrow.

610
00:50:49.058 --> 00:50:52.321
- SharkWeek is all week long.
- God, I just wanna bang hot chicks.

611
00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:43.361
- Move it.
- Sorry.

612
00:51:44.165 --> 00:51:45.596
Big smile.

613
00:51:55.602 --> 00:51:59.195
- Yo, man, no press!
- No, no, no. I'm not-- I'm not press.

614
00:51:59.303 --> 00:52:03.060
I 'm still in high school, okay?
This is for my high school video yearbook.

615
00:52:03.165 --> 00:52:05.597
I swear to God.

616
00:52:06.633 --> 00:52:09.657
That's right, bitch.

617
00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:11.734
Athena!

618
00:52:15.836 --> 00:52:18.564
Jesus, is that her?

619
00:52:19.672 --> 00:52:21.797
Come on. Come on.

620
00:52:39.572 --> 00:52:41.538
Give me a second, guys.

621
00:52:41.639 --> 00:52:43.402
Athena! Athena!

622
00:52:43.508 --> 00:52:45.667
- Danielle.
- Athena! Athena!

623
00:52:45.775 --> 00:52:48.105
Danielle.

624
00:52:48.208 --> 00:52:51.835
Athena, right here.
Keep working it, Athena.

625
00:52:54.444 --> 00:52:58.902
Look, I'm sorry.
I-- I had to come.

626
00:52:59.013 --> 00:53:01.479
I feel like
this is all my fault.

627
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.671
Who is this guy?

628
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:05.765
Will you at least
look at me?

629
00:53:07.442 --> 00:53:10.034
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me, okay?

630
00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:12.168
- Me too!
- Danielle.

631
00:53:12.278 --> 00:53:14.608
He's so sweet.

632
00:53:16.612 --> 00:53:19.274
Danielle.

633
00:53:19.381 --> 00:53:22.007
Nice job, dickwad.

634
00:53:22.115 --> 00:53:24.604
- Danielle.
- Hey, man. Get me out ofthis thing.

635
00:53:24.716 --> 00:53:26.682
- Take me with you, dude.
- Danielle.

636
00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:28.978
J ust leave me alone,

637
00:53:30.017 --> 00:53:32.212
Danielle.

638
00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:35.379
Danielle, Danielle, Danielle.

639
00:53:35.487 --> 00:53:37.853
- Hugo, hi.
- Look atyou.

640
00:53:37.947 --> 00:53:40.675
You look fantastic.

00:53:40.782 --> 00:53:44.739
Juststarting out
andeveryone knowsyourname.

642
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.079
- No, they don't.
- So how's Kelly treating you?

643
00:53:48.185 --> 00:53:50.242
- Okay.
- Just okay?

644
00:53:51.453 --> 00:53:53.578
Danielle,
what do we know? Hmm?

645
00:53:53.687 --> 00:53:55.585
- Uh--
- What do we know?

646
00:53:55.687 --> 00:53:58.622
We know thatyoushould

647
00:53:58.723 --> 00:54:01.519
At the top
where the air is crisp.

648
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:05.756
- Nice tan.
- Kelly, what do we say?

649
00:54:05.857 --> 00:54:07.848
Fuckyou.

650
00:54:07.959 --> 00:54:10.976
Always with the big words.

651
00:54:11.087 --> 00:54:13.713
Danielle,
where the air is crisp.

652
00:54:16.188 --> 00:54:20.054
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. He's just being Hugo.

653
00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:23.283
Matty.
What areyou doing here?

654
00:54:24.392 --> 00:54:27.086
Um, look, Kelly,
no offense...

655
00:54:27.193 --> 00:54:30.183
but I really don't think
Danielle wants to be here right now.

656
00:54:35.028 --> 00:54:37.326
Matthew, please just
go home, okay?

657
00:54:39.964 --> 00:54:43.083
Hey, "D." "D."

658
00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:47.058
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
Let's get out ofhere.

659
00:54:51.227 --> 00:54:53.923
What's up?

660
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.724
- It's not cute anymore.
- What?

661
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:59.923
Stop filling her head with that--
Do not piss me off!

662
00:55:00.032 --> 00:55:02.021
Hey, I thought
we were friends.

663
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.889
Friends don't fuckwith
each other's business.

664
00:55:06.001 --> 00:55:08.695
And that's what this is--
my fuckin' business.

665
00:55:11.636 --> 00:55:14.296
What?

666
00:55:14.403 --> 00:55:16.421
What areyou gonna do?

667
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:21.666
Yeah, that's what I thought.

668
00:55:21.766 --> 00:55:23.664
Stay the fuck away from her.

669
00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:31.731
Matt, seriously, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

670
00:55:31.837 --> 00:55:34.360
Hey, what about your thing tomorrow?
The scholarship dinner?

671
00:55:35.839 --> 00:55:37.828
Sorry, I gotta do this.

672
00:55:43.808 --> 00:55:47.401
Oh, by the way, ifthings get bad,
just bolt, okay?

673
00:55:47.509 --> 00:55:51.129
- What? What do you mean
"things get bad"?

674
00:55:51.237 --> 00:55:54.102
Wait, wait.
What's he talking about?

675
00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:14.044
Hi.

676
00:56:18.582 --> 00:56:21.041
Dude, am I ugly?

677
00:56:21.142 --> 00:56:22.698
What?

678
00:56:22.809 --> 00:56:25.640
No. No, man.
You're fine.

679
00:56:25.743 --> 00:56:28.576
- Just--Just relax.
- No, I'm ugly. I know it.

680
00:56:30.145 --> 00:56:32.873
So, what doyou guys do?

681
00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:35.878
I get freaky.

682
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.640
Uh-- Uh, we're directors.

683
00:56:38.748 --> 00:56:42.238
Really? Wouldyou guys
ever want to use me

684
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:44.112
Uh--

685
00:56:44.218 --> 00:56:46.207
Hell, yeah, we'll use you.

686
00:56:46.318 --> 00:56:50.218
Baby, I'll do things to you
I wouldn't do to a farm animal.

687
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.289

688
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:56.075

00:56:56.182 --> 00:57:00.082

Man, you gotta use my girl, bro.
She's so good.

693
00:57:14.488 --> 00:57:16.456

00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:32.852
Fuck it. I'll feel one.

We're allset fortomorrow.
Athena will be there,

700
00:57:50.562 --> 00:57:54.587
Not bad, huh? Suckers cost me six grand.

701
00:57:54.697 --> 00:57:56.631
Yo, Mule.

702
00:57:56.731 --> 00:57:58.633
What the hell are you doing?

703
00:57:58.726 --> 00:58:01.591
Steel, check it out, man.

704
00:58:01.693 --> 00:58:03.921
These guys are directors.

705
00:58:04.027 --> 00:58:06.823
Man, these punks
ain't directors.

706
00:58:06.928 --> 00:58:10.293
They're in high school, you idiot.

707
00:58:10.396 --> 00:58:12.660
Okay, here's the thing--

708
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.627
Oh, shit!

709
00:58:25.336 --> 00:58:27.325
- Come on, Klitz!
- Get off ofthis!

710
00:58:27.436 --> 00:58:29.493
Whoa!

711
00:58:37.066 --> 00:58:39.498
- Matty, time to go. Time to go.

712
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.397
It got bad.
Bolt! Bolt!

713
00:58:41.502 --> 00:58:43.900

714
00:58:50.905 --> 00:58:52.632
Excuse me.

00:58:52.739 --> 00:58:55.797
I just want to letyou know,
I know who you really are.

716
00:58:57.908 --> 00:58:59.965
And you're better than this.

717
00:59:40.177 --> 00:59:42.700
Yeah.

718
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:51.847
Need a ride to school?

719
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:59.906
It's allyou now. I mean,

720
01:00:01.017 --> 01:00:02.951
Why do you
believe in me so much?

721
01:00:03.053 --> 01:00:05.781
I don't know.
Maybe I'm stupid.

722
01:00:10.182 --> 01:00:12.444
Good luck tonight.

723
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:14.515
Thanks.

724
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:17.707
- Bye.
- Bye.

725
01:00:33.623 --> 01:00:37.182
Will you go
to prom with me?

726
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:39.191
What?

727
01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:46.916
I would love to.

728
01:00:50.123 --> 01:00:55.616
Now for the scientific
explanation. Anybody?

729
01:00:58.127 --> 01:01:01.060
That your speech?

730
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:03.218
Yeah.

731
01:01:03.328 --> 01:01:05.988
You ready for tonight?

732
01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:10.189
- Don't worry, man. You're gonna be great.
- I have to be.

733
01:01:22.928 --> 01:01:25.294
That fuckin' bitch
can't just run away...

734
01:01:25.395 --> 01:01:27.522
'cause she don't want
to fuck on film anymore!

735
01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:30.154
May I helpyou?

736
01:01:30.265 --> 01:01:33.528
- Get up.
- Okay, okay.

737
01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.129
Stay in school.

738
01:01:47.866 --> 01:01:50.924
Look, I have the most important dinner
of my life tonight...

739
01:01:51.033 --> 01:01:54.592
so whereverwe're going,
we just have to be home by 6:00.

740
01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.600
Just soyou know.

741
01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.203
Here he comes.

742
01:02:02.604 --> 01:02:06.060
- It's a cool ride, huh?
- Yeah, ifyou're a fag.

743
01:02:06.172 --> 01:02:08.798
- Jesus!
- It's cool! It's cool!

744
01:02:08.906 --> 01:02:11.134
Get in.

745
01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:23.837
Where are we going?

746
01:02:23.939 --> 01:02:26.098
I thought
you were cool, man.

747
01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:28.968
I tried to beyour friend,
and what doyou do? You fuck me.

748
01:02:29.074 --> 01:02:32.872
- I didn't fuckyou.
- She didn't show up on set

749
01:02:32.976 --> 01:02:37.204
Now I'm out 30 grand.
Guess who's paying me back.

750
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:39.573
What? I don't have 30 grand.

751
01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:42.577
- Getyour folks to helpyou out.
- Theydon't have that kindofmoney.

752
01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:46.113
Look, Kelly,
I'm a problem solver, all right?

753
01:02:46.214 --> 01:02:48.908
This is what I do. Okay?

754
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.908
Let's just-- Let's just think
outside of the box here.

755
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:56.737
Look, she'll get ajob,
I'll keep mowing lawns.

756
01:02:56.843 --> 01:03:00.299
Over time, we'll pay it down.
You know? This can work.

757
01:03:00.411 --> 01:03:03.845
We can do this.
It'll be like a payment plan.

758
01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.148
You really care
about her, huh?

759
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.878
- Yeah, I really do.
- I don't know.

760
01:03:15.986 --> 01:03:18.316
IfI'm gonna do
this payment plan thing...

761
01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:20.476
I need a show
of good faith, you know?

762
01:03:20.586 --> 01:03:24.181
- Something concrete.
- Well, like what?

763
01:03:26.548 --> 01:03:30.004
A blow job.

764
01:03:30.116 --> 01:03:32.243
Nah, I told you.
She's not gonna do that anymore.

765
01:03:32.352 --> 01:03:35.217
Who said anything
about her?

766
01:03:39.153 --> 01:03:42.882
Yeah. We're definitely
outside the box now, huh?

767
01:03:42.988 --> 01:03:45.320
Nowyou gotta
askyourself...

768
01:03:45.423 --> 01:03:48.151
how far are you
willing to go, hmm?

769
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:53.046
Howmuch doyou
reallycare about her?

770
01:03:57.954 --> 01:03:59.852
I'm joking, man!

771
01:03:59.954 --> 01:04:03.149
Relax.

772
01:04:05.623 --> 01:04:08.488
- Damn! Do I look gay to you?
- No, but, geez--

773
01:04:16.161 --> 01:04:18.026
You wanna be president...

774
01:04:18.127 --> 01:04:20.687
Iet me tell you
the first rule of politics:

775
01:04:20.797 --> 01:04:24.322
Always know ifthe juice
is worth the squeeze.

776
01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:26.329
You know
what that means?

777
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:30.586
It means you don't steal my girl
unless you're ready to accept

778
01:04:36.662 --> 01:04:38.651
All right.
I'm sorry, okay?

779
01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.558
That's gonna swell up
like a bitch. Here, take these.

780
01:04:48.666 --> 01:04:51.258
I'm telling you,
it's gonna hurt like shit.

781
01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:59.627
I'm sorry I got upset.

782
01:04:59.738 --> 01:05:03.426
I just-- I felt
taken advantage of.

783
01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:07.397
Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.
I know she loves you.

784
01:05:07.499 --> 01:05:09.933
I'm gonna leave
you guys alone.

785
01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.194
But nowyou're doing
something for me.

786
01:05:23.174 --> 01:05:25.436
Remember that ass-bag Hugo
from the convention?

787
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.905
We used to be partners
a long time ago.

788
01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:29.906
One day, I had
this killer idea...

789
01:05:30.008 --> 01:05:32.101
to make films set in
real-life situations.

790
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:35.762
You know,
Real World porn.

791
01:05:35.871 --> 01:05:38.770
I tell the idea to Hugo.
He says he'll think about it.

792
01:05:38.872 --> 01:05:41.134
And what does that
motherfucker do?

793
01:05:41.239 --> 01:05:44.729
Takes my best girls,
starts his own companywith my idea...

794
01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:47.069
and the guy
makes millions.

795
01:05:47.175 --> 01:05:50.142
It's not the money that pisses me off.
I mean, yeah, fuck...

796
01:05:50.242 --> 01:05:52.176
it does piss me off,
but that's not it.

797
01:05:52.278 --> 01:05:54.972
It's the perception.
Everybody thinks Hugo's the genius.

798
01:05:55.078 --> 01:05:59.272
It was my idea. It's like he's Simon
and I'm Garfunkel.

799
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.046
Look at me, man.

800
01:06:03.147 --> 01:06:05.172
I'm fuckin' Garfunkel.

801
01:06:08.277 --> 01:06:10.368
Look, seriously.
I can't do this.

802
01:06:10.477 --> 01:06:12.602
Don't be a pussy.
Nobody's home.

803
01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:21.675
- Why doyou want this thing so bad?
- Because. It should've been mine.

804
01:06:21.782 --> 01:06:24.180
- I'mjust gonna grab it andleave.
- You don't understand.

805
01:06:24.283 --> 01:06:28.682
I have to be at a dinner in an hour.
Mywhole life depends on it.

806
01:06:28.783 --> 01:06:31.944
- You want me out of Danielle's life?
- Yes, I do.

807
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:34.576
- Then let's go.
- But wait. Seriously--

808
01:06:34.687 --> 01:06:38.380
Sometimes in life,
ifyou want to do something good,

809
01:06:38.487 --> 01:06:41.606
Yeah, but this is
breaking and entering.

810
01:06:41.714 --> 01:06:43.614
This is politics.

811
01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:52.208
Hey, after this,
we're cool, okay?

812
01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.820
You're all right, man.

813
01:07:25.158 --> 01:07:28.717
Yes. I'd like to report
a robbery.

814
01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:46.316
Bang me!

815
01:07:46.427 --> 01:07:48.859
Cradle the balls!

816
01:08:01.299 --> 01:08:04.061
Help me!

817
01:08:04.166 --> 01:08:06.894
Help! Ah, fuck!

818
01:08:11.303 --> 01:08:14.737
Wait! Come on!

819
01:08:33.637 --> 01:08:35.865
Okay, so what time
does the dinner start?

820
01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:39.370
6:00. Why?
What time is it now?

821
01:08:39.472 --> 01:08:42.405
- 6:30.
- Oh, my God!

822
01:08:42.507 --> 01:08:44.407
Don't worry.
We'll get there.Just try and--

823
01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:46.907
Dude, what areyou doing?

824
01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:50.342
I don't know. I just--

825
01:08:50.446 --> 01:08:54.303
I feel so good.

826
01:09:01.008 --> 01:09:03.133
Oh, my God.

827
01:09:04.577 --> 01:09:06.736
I-- I just feel
so weird.

828
01:09:06.844 --> 01:09:09.333
Shh. Don't worry.
Ecstasy is not that bad.

829
01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:13.742
- What?
- Kelly likes dosing people with "E."

830
01:09:13.847 --> 01:09:16.279
Oh, my God.
Am I gonna die?

831
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.337
No, no. It's okay, Matt.
You're gonna be fine, I promise.

832
01:09:20.449 --> 01:09:24.240
You're such a good friend,
Klitzy. I love you.

833
01:09:24.344 --> 01:09:26.572
I love you so much.

834
01:09:26.678 --> 01:09:29.907
This is gonna be amazing!

835
01:09:31.278 --> 01:09:33.178
Wait a second.

836
01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.474
Oh, my God.

837
01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:40.573
You don't understand.

838
01:09:40.684 --> 01:09:42.673
It's really
kicking in right now.

839
01:09:42.784 --> 01:09:44.875
Just try not to talk
so much, okay?

840
01:09:44.984 --> 01:09:47.145
Talk so much?
I'm giving a speech.

841
01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.651
- It's okay.Just go with it.
- Wait, wait, wait!

842
01:09:49.753 --> 01:09:54.209
In a few minutes, we'll begin
the speeches, and we hope--

843
01:10:00.716 --> 01:10:04.775

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:09.656
Matthew, what has been
going on with you?

855
01:11:09.762 --> 01:11:11.627
Some serious shit.

856
01:11:11.731 --> 01:11:14.698
But, Jesus, man,
it's good to seeyou!

857
01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:17.027
Will you excuse us,
please?

858
01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:20.665
Oh, my God.
Am I blowing it?

859
01:11:20.767 --> 01:11:24.201
Just try and control yourself.
Just breathe, okay?

860
01:11:24.302 --> 01:11:27.497
All right.

861
01:11:30.504 --> 01:11:33.200
I've learneda lot
from myteachers...

862
01:11:33.307 --> 01:11:37.665
but my best teacher
has always been my mother...

863
01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:41.132
a woman who worked threejobs
trying to support me...

864
01:11:41.236 --> 01:11:43.202
eversince
I was a little nina.

865
01:11:43.302 --> 01:11:45.860
I will never forget
the dayshe said to me...

866
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:49.335
"Si trabajas duro,
todo es posible."

867
01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:54.565
And that is why I have always
tried to answer the call

868
01:11:54.672 --> 01:11:56.572
who urged us to ask not
what your country--

869
01:12:06.738 --> 01:12:09.500
Let's see here.

870
01:12:09.606 --> 01:12:13.165
I can't speak a foreign language,
so that's out.

871
01:12:13.274 --> 01:12:18.572
And I certainlycan't quote
J.F.K.. Now, can I, Ryan?

872
01:12:18.675 --> 01:12:22.541
You know, it's funny.
I have this whole speech prepared...

873
01:12:22.644 --> 01:12:27.839
and I 've been practicing
for weeks, but you know what?

874
01:12:27.945 --> 01:12:30.912
I 'm just gonna go with it.

875
01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:37.245
Moral fiber.
So what is moral fiber?

876
01:12:37.349 --> 01:12:39.242
I mean, it's funny.

877
01:12:39.344 --> 01:12:42.869
I used to think it was always telling
the truth, doing good deeds...

878
01:12:42.979 --> 01:12:47.241
you know, basically being
a fucking Boy Scout.

879
01:12:47.346 --> 01:12:50.472
But latelyI've been seeing it differently.

880
01:12:50.614 --> 01:12:56.244
Now I think that moral fiber
is about finding that one thing

881
01:12:56.349 --> 01:13:01.512
That one special thing
that means more toyou than

882
01:13:03.452 --> 01:13:07.011
And whenyou find her,
you fight for her.

883
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.145
You risk it all.

884
01:13:09.256 --> 01:13:11.238
You put her
in front ofeverything--

885
01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:14.578
your future, your life--
all ofit.

886
01:13:16.016 --> 01:13:19.882
And maybe the stuffyou do
to help her isn't so clean.

887
01:13:19.985 --> 01:13:22.317
You know what?
I t doesn't matter.

888
01:13:24.754 --> 01:13:26.686
Because in your heart,
you know...

889
01:13:26.787 --> 01:13:29.583
that the juice
is worth the squeeze.

890
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.423
That's what
moral fiber's all about.

891
01:13:58.192 --> 01:14:01.218
First, I'd just like
to commend the candidates...

892
01:14:01.328 --> 01:14:03.226
on their impressive remarks.

893
01:14:03.328 --> 01:14:07.524
Thisyearwas
a verytough decision.

894
01:14:07.631 --> 01:14:12.257
Andas much as we'd love
to giveyou allscholarships, we can't.

895
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.491
And so, I am proud
to announce...

896
01:14:15.599 --> 01:14:19.492
the winner ofthis year's
Sheridan Scholarship...

897
01:14:23.429 --> 01:14:25.861
Ryan Winger.

898
01:15:06.539 --> 01:15:08.903
Oh, God, what happened?

899
01:15:09.007 --> 01:15:11.872
Yeah, I slipped.

900
01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.463
Listen, Jeannie,
Samnang's coming on Monday.

901
01:15:14.575 --> 01:15:16.473
I know.
How exciting.

902
01:15:16.575 --> 01:15:19.237
Yeah, so I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

903
01:15:19.344 --> 01:15:23.770
- What doyou mean?
- I mean I'm gonna need

904
01:15:23.871 --> 01:15:26.838
- But it's already closed.
- What areyou talking about?

905
01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.929
Your teacher came byyesterday,
and he cleared out the account.

906
01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.668
- Who? What teacher?
- Your student adviser.

907
01:15:32.774 --> 01:15:35.402
Mr. Salinger. The one
you were with the other day.

908
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:38.602
Mr. Salinger?
What areyou--

909
01:15:51.182 --> 01:15:54.370
Samnang,
what's wrong, my son?

910
01:15:54.477 --> 01:15:56.534
That Matthew Kidman.

911
01:15:56.644 --> 01:16:01.511
He fucked me, Mom.
He fucked me so bad!

912
01:16:01.613 --> 01:16:03.511
Son of a bitch.

913
01:16:06.981 --> 01:16:10.176
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

914
01:16:10.283 --> 01:16:12.875
Jeannie, didn'tyou
ask for I.D. or anything?

915
01:16:12.983 --> 01:16:15.506
You said he was
your student adviser.

916
01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:18.245
Oh, my God.

917
01:16:20.921 --> 01:16:22.887
- Jeannie, where areyou going?
- To get the manager.

918
01:16:22.987 --> 01:16:26.914
- No, wait, wait.
- Matthew, what's going on?

919
01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.949
Look...

920
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:33.074
that guywasn't
my student adviser.

921
01:16:33.184 --> 01:16:36.583
No. I know, I know.
I can get the money back.

922
01:16:36.686 --> 01:16:40.245
We just need to keep this
between me and you for now, okay?

923
01:16:40.354 --> 01:16:42.843
That's a great blouse.
Have you lost weight?

924
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:46.121
No? No, wait, wait!

925
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:50.080
Jeannie! Jeannie!
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

926
01:16:50.191 --> 01:16:53.056
You think about this.
This is your fault too.

927
01:16:53.159 --> 01:16:55.751
You didn't ask for I.D.
You didn't do anything.

928
01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.049
And I sawyou flirting with him.
So unprofessional. You're gonna

929
01:17:00.155 --> 01:17:02.121
Don'tyou threaten me,
you little shit!

930
01:17:02.222 --> 01:17:04.654
I could give a fuck aboutyou
and your little rice boy.

931
01:17:04.756 --> 01:17:08.349
- I'm not getting fired over this!
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

932
01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:11.913
Please.Just-- No one can ever
find out about this.

933
01:17:12.026 --> 01:17:14.754
Ifthis gets out, I'll be expelled.
My life will be over.

934
01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:18.726
Ifthat money isn't back by Monday,
I wouldn't worry about being expelled.

935
01:17:18.828 --> 01:17:20.726
I'd worry about
going to jail.

936
01:17:21.896 --> 01:17:23.794
Jeannie.

937
01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:25.761
- Hi, Jeannie.
- Hi, Martin.

938
01:17:55.136 --> 01:17:57.329
Matthew, what's wrong?

939
01:17:57.436 --> 01:18:01.495
Matt, is there something

940
01:18:01.605 --> 01:18:03.798
Matthew, honey, what is it?

941
01:18:11.135 --> 01:18:14.125
- H i.
- Come here.

942
01:18:21.806 --> 01:18:23.738
I 'm i n so m uch trouble.

943
01:18:35.476 --> 01:18:39.460
I can't believe
we're even thinking about this.

944
01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:46.232
Well, ifyou need
that kind of money by Monday--

945
01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:49.536
Yeah, but what are we doing?
I can't getyou involved in this.

946
01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:52.074
I want to do it.

947
01:18:52.176 --> 01:18:54.076
Why?

948
01:18:55.577 --> 01:18:57.477
Moral fiber.

949
01:18:59.313 --> 01:19:01.745
- I'm in.
- You haven't heard the whole plan.

950
01:19:01.846 --> 01:19:03.746
Ah! It doesn't matter.

951
01:19:03.848 --> 01:19:06.713
Fuck film school.
This is gonna be huge.

952
01:19:06.816 --> 01:19:10.072
This is gonna be
my calling card.

953
01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:12.075
No.

954
01:19:12.177 --> 01:19:14.405
- Klitzy.
- No way.

955
01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:18.104
Klitz, you know I wouldn't ask for this
unless I really needed it.

956
01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:20.772
Matt, believe me,
I want to helpyou, but... no.

957
01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.280
- We'll get expelled.
- Klitz, shut up.

958
01:19:23.382 --> 01:19:25.746
Do me a favor, okay?

959
01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:29.305
Take a look at us.
Take a good look at us.

960
01:19:29.418 --> 01:19:34.044
Doyou know what we are,
the three of us?

961
01:19:34.152 --> 01:19:36.052
What?

962
01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:39.451
We're a fuckin' tripod.

963
01:19:39.555 --> 01:19:43.708
- A tripod.
- Yeah. You know what that means?

964
01:19:43.815 --> 01:19:48.978
That means ifyou kick out
one of our legs, then we all fall.

965
01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:51.347
Come on, baby!

966
01:19:56.821 --> 01:19:58.719
Fuck.

967
01:20:01.223 --> 01:20:04.054
I know it was you, Klitzy.

968
01:20:06.024 --> 01:20:08.889
- Where is she?
- Oh, there they are. Hey!

969
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:12.883
- Hey!
- Hi, Danielle!

970
01:20:12.993 --> 01:20:15.585
Hi!

971
01:20:17.422 --> 01:20:19.615
Let's get our luggage. Yeah!

972
01:20:19.722 --> 01:20:22.814
- All right?
- I'll be there in a minute.

973
01:20:44.064 --> 01:20:46.692
So if I pull this off,
I get the 25 grand on Sunday?

974
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.520
Kid, you pull this off,
I'll take care ofyour little Samsung.

975
01:20:50.626 --> 01:20:53.060
- Samnang.
- Whatever.

976
01:20:53.162 --> 01:20:55.060
Have a nice prom, kid.

977

01:21:12.503 --> 01:21:14.594
Relax, relax.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.635
You know what?
Go wait in the car. Go.

980
01:21:21.107 --> 01:21:23.223

Okay, get a two-shot.

All right, guys, get closer.
Yeah, that's right. Show me the love.

986
01:21:46.007 --> 01:21:48.100
Feel it, feel it! Nice.

987
01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:51.735
Eli, do those girls
go to your school?

988
01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:55.736
Uh, actually, no,
Mrs. Kidman.

989
01:21:55.838 --> 01:22:00.068
They're porn stars.

01:22:15.612 --> 01:22:17.671
Y-You look, uh--

991
01:22:17.781 --> 01:22:19.679

You really do, hon.
You look so beautiful.

01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:27.767
Really? Oh, thanks.

995
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:21.089
- What are all these cameras for?
- They're for video yearbook.

996
01:23:45.393 --> 01:23:48.883
So what should we do?
Should we start setting up?

997
01:23:48.995 --> 01:23:51.086
Yeah. We just gotta
keep this low-key, okay?

998
01:23:51.195 --> 01:23:53.093
Okay.
What are you gonna do?

999
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.628
I'm gonna get
our actors.

1000
01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:01.932
Dude, make sure
they can act.

1001

Yeah, all right.

Hey, I got this

You just show this little lady

Look.
They're coming toyou.

01:24:38.067 --> 01:24:40.932
Yo, Matt. What's up?

1009
01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:44.433
- What's up?
- Can we talk toyou for a second?

1010
01:24:44.536 --> 01:24:46.695
Dude, I'm with my girl here.

1011
01:24:46.803 --> 01:24:48.894

- Sorry, man.

1012
01:24:49.003 --> 01:24:51.267
- Should we come back?
- No. I'llleaveyou guys alone.

1013
01:25:05.376 --> 01:25:08.434
- What's up?
- What's up with those girls?

1014
01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:13.563
- What about 'em?
- Are they, like, uh--

1015
01:25:13.673 --> 01:25:16.640
- Are they porn stars?
- Yeah.

1016
01:25:16.741 --> 01:25:19.105
Shit!

1017
01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:21.140
I knew I recognized them.
I knew it.

1018
01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.307
- Can we meet 'em?
- Yeah.

1019
01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:30.042
How'd you boys like
to be in a movie?

1020
01:25:30.146 --> 01:25:32.203
- What are these?

1036
01:27:07.763 --> 01:27:09.820
Aw, come on!

1037

Take the pain! Take the pain!
Get up! Come on!

1038
01:27:15.832 --> 01:27:17.732
May I have a word with you?

- What's up?
- I found this in the hallway.

1040
01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:23.861
Do you know what this is?

1041
01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:25.951
No. What is it?

1042
01:27:26.062 --> 01:27:28.221
Looks like a release form
for something.

1043
01:27:28.329 --> 01:27:31.196
Yeah, I...
don't know what it is.

1044
01:27:33.566 --> 01:27:35.862
Have a good night.

1045
01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:56.997
You're strong,

1046
01:27:57.102 --> 01:27:59.364

1053
01:28:52.516 --> 01:28:57.884

- Let's just say he wasn't strong or firm.

1054
01:28:57.977 --> 01:29:01.103
- Guys, I can't work like this!
- Okay, relax.

1055
01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.303
- We'll just get somebody else.
- There is nobody else.

1056
01:29:03.445 --> 01:29:06.469
- I thought everyone's dyin' to be in this.
- Not this scene.

1057
01:29:09.748 --> 01:29:13.648
All right.
This is the key scene.

1058
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:16.842
Ifwe don't get this,
Hugo's not gonna buy it.

1059
01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:20.248
Well, somebody's
gotta step up.

1060
01:29:20.352 --> 01:29:23.183
- Whyyou lookin' at me?
- Becauseyou're doing it.

1061
01:29:23.287 --> 01:29:25.719
Whoa, Mr. I-just-want-to-
bang-hot-chicks.

1063
01:29:28.688 --> 01:29:30.672
Klitz, I can't act

1064
01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:33.079
- Oh, okay, fine. I'll direct.
- Oh, you're a director now.

1065
01:29:33.183 --> 01:29:35.911
- Yeah, I'm a director.

- Nobody move!
- Ah, shit.

1076
01:31:17.469 --> 01:31:19.369
Who is in charge ofthis?

1077
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:22.728
I asked you people
a question!

1078
01:31:22.837 --> 01:31:25.032

- What's wrong?
- I can't do this.

1082
01:32:18.245 --> 01:32:20.611
What happened?

1083
01:32:30.885 --> 01:32:32.783
What areyou gonna do?

1084
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.418
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

1085
01:32:41.721 --> 01:32:45.418
No. I'll do it.

1086
01:32:47.017 --> 01:32:50.178
- Klitz, it's cool.
- No, no. I'm doing it.

1087
01:32:50.285 --> 01:32:52.080
Why?

1088
01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.710
'Cause we're a fuckin' tripod.

1103
01:35:54.687 --> 01:35:57.620

Somebody stole it!
Jesus Christ!

1106
01:36:04.351 --> 01:36:07.580
Matthew,

1107
01:36:12.054 --> 01:36:14.748
This is Mr. Simon.

1108
01:36:14.855 --> 01:36:19.222
Hesays he has something
veryimportant to discuss with us.

1109
01:36:22.657 --> 01:36:24.420
Sit down.

1110
01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:30.283
Actually, ifyou don't mind...

1111
01:36:30.394 --> 01:36:32.792

1112
01:36:32.894 --> 01:36:34.912
Sure.

01:36:45.094 --> 01:36:47.720
So how was prom?

You say that like I care.
I don't give a shit.

1129
01:37:37.407 --> 01:37:39.307

1146
01:38:54.248 --> 01:38:56.510
Special events
such as seniorprom...

1147
01:38:56.615 --> 01:38:58.515
place added pressure
on young teens...

1148
01:38:58.617 --> 01:39:01.641
to lose their virginity and
engage in unprotected sex.

1149
01:39:01.752 --> 01:39:04.344
I know I lost myvirginity
at my senior prom.

1150
01:39:04.452 --> 01:39:06.475

1155
01:39:17.717 --> 01:39:19.615

01:39:27.054 --> 01:39:30.453

1160
01:39:30.555 --> 01:39:34.080
- becauseyou're not gonna see sex.
- What the fuck is this shit?

1161
01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:37.624
You're gonna see
sex education.

1162
01:39:48.695 --> 01:39:50.622
This is interesting,
Matthew.

1163
01:39:53.758 --> 01:39:55.849
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:39:55.958 --> 01:39:58.481
I think
it's a great idea.

1165
01:40:01.493 --> 01:40:05.120
Well, you rememberthose sex ed films
back in our day.

1166
01:40:05.228 --> 01:40:08.787
I'll tell ya, ifthey
were anything like this...

1167
01:40:08.896 --> 01:40:11.863
we surewould've paid more attention,
don'tyou think?

1168
01:40:13.432 --> 01:40:15.694
I think it's atrocious.

1169
01:40:18.633 --> 01:40:23.288
But... the hell with it.

1170
01:40:23.396 --> 01:40:25.760
The kids today are
so goddamn screwed up...

1171
01:40:25.863 --> 01:40:28.830
maybe this is the onlyway
you can reach them.

1172
01:40:31.998 --> 01:40:34.157
You just might have
something here, Matthew.

1173
01:40:34.265 --> 01:40:36.495
I think it's prettywild.

1174
01:40:37.767 --> 01:40:39.667
This could really sell,
don't you think?

1175
01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.897
How'd you come up
with such an idea, Matthew?

1176
01:40:45.003 --> 01:40:50.528
What can I say?
It's like a gift, you know?

1177
01:40:50.638 --> 01:40:52.606
It's like I can't control it.

1178
