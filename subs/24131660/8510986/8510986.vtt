1
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.583
- Yeah?
<i>- It's me.</i>

2
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.724
<i>Remember what we talked about?</i>

3
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.793
<i>Take care of the problem.</i>

4
00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:38.793
<i>This is a lot of money
we're talking about here.</i>

5
00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:40.876
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Yeah, I got this.

6
00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:42.915
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

7
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.083
Watch my back and
don't fuck this up.

8
00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.467
Come on, come on, come on.

9
00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.376
<i>In local
news, police are still looking</i>

10
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:02.359
<i>for two masked men after
reports of an armed robbery</i>

11
00:03:02.384 --> 00:03:05.204
<i>at McCarthy's Payday
Loans in Shamrock.</i>

12
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.462
<i>Gunshots were heard on the
street at approximately 11pm.</i>

13
00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:11.445
<i>Witnesses reported
a dark BMW plate...</i>

14
00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.011
- Hello.
<i>- He fucked us.</i>

15
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.661
- What?
<i>- Detour, Creston Ave.</i>

16
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.223
<i>The bus stop outside
the hardware store.</i>

17
00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:31.266
<i>- He's waiting for you there.</i>
- Who's waiting for...

18
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:33.166
what? What's going on?

19
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.893
<i>The kid, he fucked us.</i>

20
00:03:34.918 --> 00:03:36.688
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

21
00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:38.684
<i>Drive him over here
and we'll do the rest.</i>

22
00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.172
<i>- You can have his cut.</i>
- I don't want his cut.

23
00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:43.489
That was not our deal.
I'm not your errand boy.

24
00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.532
<i>Just get him here, make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

25
00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.099
Just get... get someone else.

26
00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:50.874
<i>Don't let him know
anything's up.</i>

27
00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.732
Wait. What did he do?

28
00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:56.418
Hello?

29
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.293
What the hell is this?

30
00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:57.251
I'm sorry we're late.
I lost track of time.

31
00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:58.251
We were getting ice-cream.

32
00:04:58.293 --> 00:04:59.876
I gotta drop her
off at her mom's.

33
00:04:59.918 --> 00:05:01.060
It's only a couple
blocks from here.

34
00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:02.876
Do I look like a taxi to you?

35
00:05:03.575 --> 00:05:05.599
Please, I have to.

36
00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:08.751
Man, I just got the call.
How would I have known?

37
00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:10.185
You mind if I put
her in the back?

38
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.835
Leave it! Don't.

39
00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.709
This is bullshit.

40
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:18.950
Sorry.

41
00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.392
I can't help it, man.

42
00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:25.834
Do they always just call
in the middle of nowhere,

43
00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.418
like just, "Let's go"?

44
00:05:31.543 --> 00:05:33.251
Do not slam the doors.

45
00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.262
Where?

46
00:05:37.668 --> 00:05:40.126
- Oakmere.
- Oakmere?

47
00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:42.334
You know we're on
a schedule, right?

48
00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.751
That is a six-minute detour.

49
00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:46.876
This is not daddy-daughter day.

50
00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.334
Hey.

51
00:05:59.376 --> 00:06:01.043
Oink!

52
00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:03.168
Yeah.

53
00:06:04.168 --> 00:06:05.584
So how does this work?

54
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.709
Do we just go, collect
our cut and that's it

55
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:09.293
or are we getting another job?

56
00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:10.793
What are you thinking?

57
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.115
Don't worry about
her, by the way.

58
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.515
She... she's three years old.

59
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.851
She's not gonna be
talking to anybody.

60
00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:19.518
Yeah, well, in this car,

61
00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:22.168
we don't talk about our
business in front of anyone.

62
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:24.717
Definitely.

63
00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:40.144
Hey, we'll get some
ice-cream tomorrow, alright?

64
00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.043
Yeah.

65
00:06:41.084 --> 00:06:43.001
Daddy's gotta go
pick up some money.

66
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.834
You're closing
early tonight.

67
00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.958
Stop what you're doing

68
00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:01.543
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.

69
00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:04.669
You don't wanna do this.

70
00:07:04.694 --> 00:07:06.819
Oh, but I'm sure
I fucking want to.

71
00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:09.474
- Stay right there!
- Dad?

72
00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.999
Shut the fuck up!
Hit the lights.

73
00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:13.607
You got it.

74
00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.668
What you fucking
waiting for? Get up!

75
00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.001
Come on, come on, come on.

76
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.668
Do you know who I am?

77
00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.751
I know exactly who you are.

78
00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:30.251
Then you know you're making
a big fucking mistake.

79
00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:32.876
Yeah? Is that
supposed to scare me?

80
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.501
I've been in this line
of work over 40 years.

81
00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:40.001
You think you're
the first asshole

82
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.044
to wave a gun in my face?

83
00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.860
- Get the fuck up!
- Let me tell you...

84
00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:50.251
no-one has ever tried
stealing from me

85
00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:54.334
and lived long enough
to spend a fucking dime.

86
00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:58.251
Yeah, is that right? Get
down. Get the fuck down!

87
00:07:58.293 --> 00:07:59.793
I'll be the first
one to do it right.

88
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.334
You had your chance to just
walk right out of here.

89
00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:08.043
Put the fucking gun down!

90
00:08:08.084 --> 00:08:09.959
No-one needs to get hurt!

91
00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.001
Where's Mommy?

92
00:08:15.043 --> 00:08:16.685
I'm gonna drop you
off with your Mommy.

93
00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.209
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:20.060
Listen, I have to go
pick up the money, alright?

95
00:08:20.084 --> 00:08:21.724
- You fucking kidding me?
- I know.

96
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.644
- They just called me.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

97
00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:26.251
I have work in half an hour.
You said you would take her.

98
00:08:26.293 --> 00:08:27.918
What am I supposed to do?

99
00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.168
Hey!

100
00:08:30.584 --> 00:08:32.763
- Jesus!
- It's a lot of money.

101
00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:34.154
Yeah, dirty money.

102
00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.072
And if I don't go to work,
I'll get fucking fired.

103
00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:37.544
You know I need those tips.

104
00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:45.084
Come on, come on.

105
00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:50.473
Shit.

106
00:08:51.199 --> 00:08:52.990
I'm doing this for you,
I'm doing it for her.

107
00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:54.366
I don't wanna hear
it. You know what?

108
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:55.575
You wanna do something for us,

109
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.268
just do what you
say you're gonna do.

110
00:08:57.293 --> 00:08:58.959
I'll make it up to you, alright?

111
00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:00.376
Fuck off.

112
00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:16.474
Sorry about that.

113
00:09:19.146 --> 00:09:21.313
This whole
situation's temporary.

114
00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:24.581
She deserves better.

115
00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:27.917
What about you? You got kids?

116
00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:30.785
I saw you're married.

117
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.105
Been doing this for
a while, haven't you?

118
00:09:37.797 --> 00:09:39.130
I could tell.

119
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.212
Probably got a nice place, huh?

120
00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.010
I wanna get something
big for her.

121
00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:47.535
Something like on
a corner street,

122
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.668
one of those big mansions.

123
00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:50.949
If it's not about the job, I
don't need to know, alright?

124
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:56.506
So where's the meet?

125
00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.474
It's about the job.

126
00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:05.543
- It's Wyevale.
- Wyevale?

127
00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:07.793
Jesus Christ, that's far.

128
00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:10.285
I don't know. You
wanna get paid or what?

129
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.769
We're going to Wyevale.

130
00:10:11.794 --> 00:10:13.211
Yeah.

131
00:10:14.738 --> 00:10:16.388
Jesus.

132
00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:38.836
I'm guessing your friend's
gonna be there tonight.

133
00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:43.043
I don't know if you
believe in karma

134
00:10:43.084 --> 00:10:45.376
and I'm no fucking
Buddha, but that shit,

135
00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:47.834
there's no way that's not
gonna catch up to him.

136
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.052
He's a fucking animal, man.

137
00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:52.251
We had everything under control.

138
00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:55.293
You know, nobody had to get
hurt, especially like that.

139
00:10:55.334 --> 00:10:57.251
I don't know what his
fucking problem was.

140
00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:03.286
Whoa! Hey, what's going on?

141
00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:09.772
What? What? What?

142
00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:11.422
Hey, eyes forward.

143
00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.632
What the hell is going on, dude?

144
00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:24.266
It's nothing. I thought
it was something.

145
00:11:29.987 --> 00:11:31.445
Are you carrying?

146
00:11:32.513 --> 00:11:33.763
No.

147
00:11:34.888 --> 00:11:36.305
Should I be?

148
00:11:56.747 --> 00:11:58.622
That's real leather, isn't it?

149
00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:01.005
Yeah.

150
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.230
Cool. It's very nice, man.

151
00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:05.797
What year is this?

152
00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:07.595
'70.

153
00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:10.876
Wow. Fuck, that's
old.

154
00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:12.388
Ancient.

155
00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:16.363
I was born in '70.

156
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:21.410
Wow. You're... you're
pretty young, actually.

157
00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:24.152
1970. That's not long ago.

158
00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:26.729
It's pretty sweet. Must have
cost you something, huh?

159
00:12:26.754 --> 00:12:28.333
Nope. It was a gift.

160
00:12:29.454 --> 00:12:30.746
A gift?

161
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:35.724
Holy shit. That's a nice gift.

162
00:12:37.263 --> 00:12:38.805
Wow!

163
00:12:39.619 --> 00:12:41.286
Good Lord, man, the
only gift I ever got

164
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:42.811
was my first baseball mitt

165
00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:45.036
and that was my brother's
hand-me-down at that.

166
00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:49.303
Clearly, I'm hanging
with the wrong people.

167
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.802
Get out of fucking town.

168
00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:56.827
A cigarette lighter?

169
00:12:56.852 --> 00:12:59.997
Nice, very nice.

170
00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:03.404
Tell me that works.
Tell me that works.

171
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:15.876
You know, that's
what a lot of people

172
00:13:15.918 --> 00:13:17.084
don't get about superheroes.

173
00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:18.824
It's, like, we
can relate to them

174
00:13:18.849 --> 00:13:20.304
a whole lot more
than people think.

175
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:21.996
Like, I relate a lot.

176
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:24.418
My kid, though,
she loves Batgirl.

177
00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:27.738
We watch Batman and stuff all
the time. Like, it's so fun.

178
00:13:27.763 --> 00:13:31.394
And, yeah, like, we love
to go to the theme parks.

179
00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:33.722
- Do you go to the theme parks?
- No.

180
00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:34.972
Yeah, I didn't think so.

181
00:13:34.997 --> 00:13:36.660
But if you went, you
would love it, like...

182
00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:39.185
there's just something
about a theme park.

183
00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:41.001
You get to just roam around

184
00:13:41.043 --> 00:13:43.459
and, you know, be
a little kid again.

185
00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:46.084
And now that my kid's
three years old,

186
00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:50.043
it's, like, so fun for us to
do it together and just...

187
00:13:50.084 --> 00:13:52.865
We don't bring my wife
'cause she's a bitch.

188
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:56.129
You know, she and I love
to dress up for Halloween.

189
00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:59.558
You know, she's
Batgirl and I'm Batman.

190
00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.004
We're all into that, you know?

191
00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:02.738
And that's what I love
about Batman, you know?

192
00:14:02.763 --> 00:14:04.246
Face your fears, you know?

193
00:14:04.271 --> 00:14:06.597
And, yeah, it's a good time.

194
00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:08.810
Every time you're
dressing up with your kid,

195
00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:10.293
you know, it's always, like...

196
00:14:10.318 --> 00:14:13.552
Yeah, we're not... we're
not strict on each other.

197
00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:16.433
This is taking too long!

198
00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.623
You don't have the
balls, you pussy.

199
00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:20.574
Point the gun at his boy!

200
00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:23.263
- It's two to one!
- Put the fucking gun down now!

201
00:14:23.288 --> 00:14:24.621
You wanna know how
this plays out?

202
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:27.043
You shoot me, he shoots
him, your son is dead.

203
00:14:27.084 --> 00:14:29.251
You want that? Last
fucking chance!

204
00:14:29.293 --> 00:14:31.102
Dad, just please fucking
listen to him! Please!

205
00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:33.251
Right fucking now.
You want your kid to die?

206
00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:35.435
- He looks a little shaky to me.
- I don't know.

207
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.709
I think he looks a little
fucking trigger happy.

208
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.914
You wanna find the fuck out?

209
00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:42.855
Put the goddamn gun down
or your son gets it.

210
00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:47.393
All the way fucking down.

211
00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:51.490
Attaboy.

212
00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.658
Not so tough now, huh?

213
00:14:55.683 --> 00:14:58.349
Let's go. To the back.

214
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:05.851
Just give us the
cash and we're gone.

215
00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:07.459
Is that it?

216
00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:11.011
Let's go. Open it up.

217
00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:15.014
- Fucking open it up.
- Just do what he says!

218
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.456
That's right.

219
00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:18.918
Oh, fuck!

220
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.293
You wanna play these games?

221
00:15:21.334 --> 00:15:23.668
- I'm playing these games!
- Stop!

222
00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:25.727
- Stop, you fucking ass!
- Let's not play these games.

223
00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:26.626
Open the fucking safe!

224
00:15:26.668 --> 00:15:28.251
- Stop!
- Let's go!

225
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.490
I'm tired
of your bullshit.

226
00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:35.501
Easy.

227
00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:40.543
Any fucking day now.

228
00:15:40.584 --> 00:15:43.043
Keep your
fucking head down!

229
00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:45.083
Come on. Let's go!

230
00:15:49.262 --> 00:15:50.696
You know you're not
just stealing from me.

231
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:51.929
You know that, right?

232
00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:54.896
Hurry the fuck up!
Throw it on the ground.

233
00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:01.872
Let's go. Go.

234
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:07.677
Let's go. Out.

235
00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:16.090
Who is that?

236
00:16:19.977 --> 00:16:21.518
Seriously, man, what's going on?

237
00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:25.208
- Where are you taking me?
- I already told you, Wyevale.

238
00:16:38.402 --> 00:16:40.027
It's just my wife.

239
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:45.185
Better pick it
up. She's gonna be pissed.

240
00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:49.591
She doesn't like you
working, huh? Is that it?

241
00:16:51.058 --> 00:16:55.308
Yeah, huh, what else
are you gonna do, right?

242
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:58.513
There's no other fucking
job in this shit-hole town.

243
00:16:58.538 --> 00:16:59.830
Trust me.

244
00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.855
You know, I was
gonna be a fireman.

245
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.881
I was gonna rescue people
out of burning buildings

246
00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:09.656
and cats from trees,
all that shit,

247
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:11.472
then I find out
how much they make,

248
00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.775
I'm like, "Fuck that shit!

249
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.740
"If I'm gonna risk my life,
I wanna make some real cash."

250
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:24.220
What about you? You... you
a rally driver or something?

251
00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:25.745
That shit didn't work out?

252
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:28.002
Hmm?

253
00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:29.443
Close, aren't I?

254
00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:35.168
You know, we don't
have to do this.

255
00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.021
Don't have to do what?

256
00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:40.107
Fill every fucking silence.

257
00:17:46.424 --> 00:17:48.007
Sorry.

258
00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:58.633
Yeah, or we could
listen to that.

259
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:23.209
What is that?

260
00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:26.644
- What is what?
- Is that a burner?

261
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:28.586
What's the deal? What's
the problem, man?

262
00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:31.236
What's the matter with you, huh?
Anybody could be tracking that.

263
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:33.261
Throw it out the
window right now.

264
00:18:33.286 --> 00:18:35.004
No, I'm not throwing it
out the fucking window!

265
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:36.505
- I just bought this.
- Are you kidding me?

266
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.072
Out the window now!

267
00:18:38.097 --> 00:18:40.180
No, I'll power it...

268
00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:47.152
You fucking happy?

269
00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:48.543
Yes, I'm happy now.

270
00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:51.887
- Goddamn it, man!
- Anybody could be tracking that.

271
00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:54.957
Nobody's tracking my
phone, you paranoid fuck.

272
00:18:54.982 --> 00:18:58.338
If you fuck me on
this, I swear to God...

273
00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:33.355
I gotta call my wife.

274
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.025
What the fuck, man?

275
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.517
What was all that
bullshit about no calling?

276
00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:39.982
What the hell?

277
00:19:40.007 --> 00:19:42.049
Trust is earned, alright?

278
00:19:42.074 --> 00:19:44.616
Get back to me when you've
done more than one fucking job

279
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.016
and we'll talk.

280
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.324
I was thirsty anyway.

281
00:19:59.722 --> 00:20:02.763
<i>- We said no more detours.</i>
- Who is this?

282
00:20:02.788 --> 00:20:04.580
<i>Stop flapping your
gums and get over here.</i>

283
00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:06.589
- Put Veronica on.
<i>- No names.</i>

284
00:20:06.614 --> 00:20:08.114
<i>And don't keep her waiting.</i>

285
00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:09.556
No, we're not going anywhere

286
00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:11.459
till you tell me what's
going on, alright?

287
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.414
Who's he been talking to?

288
00:20:14.439 --> 00:20:16.022
He had his cellphone with him.

289
00:20:16.047 --> 00:20:17.564
You know, anybody
could be tracking him.

290
00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:20.088
Tell me what you know,
you no-name fuck.

291
00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:22.947
<i>- 25,000.</i>
- What?

292
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:26.708
<i>- The count was missing 25 grand.</i>
- How do you know that?

293
00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:28.608
<i>Shaun McCarthy,
fucking Frank's kid.</i>

294
00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:29.870
<i>He tipped us off
that his old man</i>

295
00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.681
<i>had exactly 900
packed up in his safe.</i>

296
00:20:32.706 --> 00:20:34.134
<i>It's 25 light.</i>

297
00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:36.338
That's it? You're gonna
kill him over 25 grand?

298
00:20:36.363 --> 00:20:37.736
Are you insane?

299
00:20:37.761 --> 00:20:40.463
How do we know for sure
it was even in there?

300
00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:43.590
<i>We're 25 short and someone
is gonna fucking pay.</i>

301
00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:45.199
Who the fuck are you?

302
00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:46.891
<i>Don't turn up without him.</i>

303
00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:50.610
Shit.

304
00:21:19.938 --> 00:21:21.869
- Pack of smokes.
- Sorry.

305
00:21:21.894 --> 00:21:23.228
The delivery didn't
come in today.

306
00:21:23.253 --> 00:21:25.128
What, so you're out?

307
00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.986
Yeah, that's what I just said.

308
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:28.636
The fuck you mean, you're out?

309
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:30.541
What, you ain't got one
pack of smokes in there?

310
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.207
- You're lying.
- No.

311
00:21:47.293 --> 00:21:49.376
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, it's me.

312
00:21:49.401 --> 00:21:52.362
<i>- Where are you calling from?</i>
- A pay phone.

313
00:21:52.972 --> 00:21:54.388
<i>Where's your cell?</i>

314
00:21:56.818 --> 00:21:58.235
<i>You're working
again, aren't you?</i>

315
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.170
<i>Jesus, how much did
you lose this time?</i>

316
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.112
Not now, alright,
Hayley? Just...

317
00:22:02.662 --> 00:22:05.037
How's he doing?

318
00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:09.419
<i>- He's fine.</i>
- Yeah? Can you put him on?

319
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:12.121
<i>Christopher, it's your dad.</i>

320
00:22:13.594 --> 00:22:16.094
<i>- Dad?</i>
- Hey.

321
00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:18.025
How's it going? How's
Pittsburgh treating you?

322
00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.383
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Yeah?

323
00:22:20.408 --> 00:22:21.751
You having any fun? What
have you been up to?

324
00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:24.462
<i>- Um, Pete took me fishing.</i>
- Yeah?

325
00:22:24.487 --> 00:22:26.337
Oh, that's great.
You catch anything?

326
00:22:26.362 --> 00:22:27.696
<i>25-pound flathead.</i>

327
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.516
Whoa! You got a picture?

328
00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.651
You gotta give me a picture
or it didn't happen.

329
00:22:32.676 --> 00:22:34.627
<i>Yeah, it's on Pete's
phone, I think.</i>

330
00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:37.112
- Oh, cool.
<i>- I'll send it to you.</i>

331
00:22:37.825 --> 00:22:39.659
It's good to hear your voice.

332
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.754
Hey, I'm gonna come and pick
you up next week, alright?

333
00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:46.363
<i>I hope so.</i>

334
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.852
Hey, I can't talk long.

335
00:22:49.877 --> 00:22:51.955
Will you put your
auntie back on?

336
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:53.968
Enjoy the rest of
your break, alright?

337
00:22:53.993 --> 00:22:55.493
<i>OK, Dad.</i>

338
00:22:55.518 --> 00:22:58.002
Hey, I love you.

339
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.587
<i>I'm surprised you
remembered the number.</i>

340
00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:05.532
Yeah, it's the same
since we were kids.

341
00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:08.876
<i>He's happy here. You have
a family and a life here.</i>

342
00:23:08.901 --> 00:23:10.956
Listen, hey, I can't
do this right now.

343
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:12.540
<i>- It's always the same.</i>
- Alright, Hayley?

344
00:23:12.565 --> 00:23:15.291
<i>- It's been a year.</i>
- You don't think I know that?

345
00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.888
<i>He needs a fresh start
so he can move on.</i>

346
00:23:16.913 --> 00:23:18.704
I... I gotta go. I gotta go.

347
00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:20.542
<i>Just please think about...</i>

348
00:23:27.744 --> 00:23:30.891
- No.
- Oh, yeah, but with this shit...

349
00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:34.165
Oh, my God. Just
fuck off. Get out.

350
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.317
Tasty shit.

351
00:23:35.342 --> 00:23:37.925
Hey, you guys done? I
got somewhere to be.

352
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.241
Hey.

353
00:23:39.266 --> 00:23:40.666
Wait your turn.

354
00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:50.134
You're doing a
good job, alright?

355
00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:52.090
- Don't worry about these guys.
- Thank you.

356
00:23:52.115 --> 00:23:54.324
- Have a good night.
- You too.

357
00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:07.724
Hey! Hey!

358
00:24:08.852 --> 00:24:10.977
Don't worry about
them. They're assholes.

359
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:45.341
Oh, what the fuck, man?

360
00:25:45.366 --> 00:25:47.658
Oh, you're calling McCarthy.

361
00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:53.979
You won't
be hard to find.

362
00:25:56.074 --> 00:25:59.157
And when we do find
you, just know this.

363
00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:02.018
- You're a fucking dead man.
- Come on.

364
00:26:03.842 --> 00:26:05.633
Let's go. Come on, come on.

365
00:26:05.658 --> 00:26:10.124
Yeah, you get used to looking
over your shoulder, asshole.

366
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:12.066
Time's up! Let's fucking go!

367
00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:13.591
The fuck you say to me?

368
00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:16.337
You heard me.

369
00:26:16.362 --> 00:26:20.154
'Cause when we find out who
you are, I swear to God...

370
00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:21.179
Ugh!

371
00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:22.922
Dude, what the hell, man?

372
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.131
No, I didn't hear!

373
00:26:25.563 --> 00:26:27.855
- Ugh!
- Say it again!

374
00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:32.874
Hey, man! Stop, stop!

375
00:26:32.899 --> 00:26:34.524
Let's go. We got we needed.

376
00:26:34.646 --> 00:26:36.062
Back off!

377
00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:37.629
Hey, now!

378
00:26:37.654 --> 00:26:39.445
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

379
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.845
- Hey, hey! Back up, back up!
- What the fuck...

380
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.287
The fuck is wrong
with you, huh?!

381
00:26:43.312 --> 00:26:45.521
This is not what we
fucking talked about!

382
00:26:45.546 --> 00:26:48.671
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here!

383
00:26:48.696 --> 00:26:51.029
- Fuck you!
- Let's fucking go.

384
00:26:51.063 --> 00:26:52.414
Let's fucking go!
- We got what we needed.

385
00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:53.724
Let's go.

386
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.895
Fuck!

387
00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:00.736
Goddamn it, man.

388
00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:02.719
I mean, what the
fuck was that, man?

389
00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:04.887
Bro, fucking
relax. Let's go.

390
00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:12.718
Fuck! Go, go, go!

391
00:27:12.743 --> 00:27:15.535
We'll fucking find you!

392
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.977
Assholes!

393
00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:50.034
Shit. Same guys from
the gas station.

394
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.274
Looks like a different vehicle.

395
00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:01.347
Just stay down. Cover your ears.

396
00:28:03.962 --> 00:28:05.712
Whoa. Hey.

397
00:28:38.544 --> 00:28:40.752
Are we good? Are we
being followed or what?

398
00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:42.860
I thought so, but I
think we're clear.

399
00:28:45.628 --> 00:28:47.711
I mean, well, you could
put your gun back.

400
00:28:59.143 --> 00:29:01.351
Hey, just so you know...

401
00:29:02.434 --> 00:29:04.309
he's no friend of mine.

402
00:29:06.422 --> 00:29:08.094
Who are you talking about?

403
00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:10.328
That piece of shit
you were working with,

404
00:29:10.353 --> 00:29:11.936
you called him my friend.

405
00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:14.841
You worked with him before?

406
00:29:14.866 --> 00:29:16.063
Yeah.

407
00:29:16.911 --> 00:29:18.536
Never again.

408
00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:23.831
I've never seen somebody get
fucked up like that before, man.

409
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.768
Not like that, not up close.

410
00:29:29.124 --> 00:29:32.874
I mean, I keep playing that
shit over and over in my head,

411
00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:36.462
just boots just
hitting his skull.

412
00:29:38.368 --> 00:29:39.428
I mean, I should've stepped in.

413
00:29:39.453 --> 00:29:40.745
I should've stopped
him or something.

414
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.979
You couldn't have stopped him.

415
00:29:42.004 --> 00:29:44.088
He's a fucking animal,
just like you said.

416
00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:47.388
That shit is on him.
He lost his cool.

417
00:29:47.413 --> 00:29:50.746
You did your part.
Just let it go.

418
00:29:53.502 --> 00:29:55.078
I'm not saying
McCarthy deserved it,

419
00:29:55.103 --> 00:29:57.186
but he laundered a
shit-ton of money

420
00:29:57.211 --> 00:30:01.344
for a ton of shitty
people, so... fuck him too.

421
00:30:03.427 --> 00:30:04.636
Yeah.

422
00:30:06.193 --> 00:30:07.907
Fuck him.

423
00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:14.525
Hey, listen, what happened
back at that gas station...

424
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.210
I don't... I don't make a
habit of doing that shit.

425
00:30:16.235 --> 00:30:19.053
I... I just drive.

426
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.778
They just caught
me on a bad day.

427
00:30:21.803 --> 00:30:23.887
Huh, I should say.

428
00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:37.362
What'd you do? What the
fuck happened back there?!

429
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.578
Fuck!

430
00:30:41.603 --> 00:30:44.395
Fucking kid freaked out
is what happened, man!

431
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.795
That piece of shit got
what he fucking deserved.

432
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.959
Shut the fuck up!

433
00:30:50.009 --> 00:30:52.467
Yeah, well, I think you
fucking killed him, man!

434
00:30:52.492 --> 00:30:54.783
- Jesus!
- Fuck you! Shut the fuck up!

435
00:30:54.808 --> 00:30:57.549
That asshole owes my brother
a lot of fucking money!

436
00:31:01.158 --> 00:31:03.637
Well, you did too and you
fucking got shot, you idiot!

437
00:31:03.678 --> 00:31:05.970
We fucking got the
job done, didn't we?

438
00:31:05.995 --> 00:31:07.245
Shut the fuck up!

439
00:31:43.718 --> 00:31:45.607
Shit.

440
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.230
What do they want, man?

441
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:51.333
Jesus, we weren't speeding.

442
00:32:03.753 --> 00:32:06.044
This thing's not stolen, is it?

443
00:32:06.069 --> 00:32:08.194
No, it isn't stolen.

444
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.626
Don't say anything stupid.

445
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:12.435
I don't want them
to search the car.

446
00:32:17.281 --> 00:32:19.281
- Evening, fellas. Licence.
- Officer.

447
00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.985
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

448
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.992
I'm looking for a
car just like this.

449
00:32:30.017 --> 00:32:32.684
Yeah, they're getting rarer
to come by these days.

450
00:32:32.709 --> 00:32:35.041
Yeah, they are. Not
many in this area.

451
00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:36.982
- No.
- You from out of town?

452
00:32:37.007 --> 00:32:39.215
Uh, yeah, just
outside of Ashland.

453
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.907
In fact, I picked this up at
a classic dealer up that way.

454
00:32:41.932 --> 00:32:43.349
I didn't say I was
looking to buy.

455
00:32:43.374 --> 00:32:45.332
I said I'm looking
for a car like this,

456
00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:47.190
a black 1970 Chevelle,

457
00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:50.256
last seen at a gas
station a few miles back.

458
00:32:50.281 --> 00:32:52.340
Oh, we haven't been to any
gas stations this evening.

459
00:32:52.365 --> 00:32:53.574
- Mn-mn.
- Is that right?

460
00:32:53.599 --> 00:32:54.742
- No, sir.
- The clerk called it in.

461
00:32:54.767 --> 00:32:56.319
Said there was an altercation.

462
00:32:56.344 --> 00:32:58.344
Well, I hope everybody's OK.

463
00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:07.240
We like to keep the
peace around these parts.

464
00:33:07.265 --> 00:33:08.682
Yes, sir.

465
00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:18.191
That blood on your jacket?

466
00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:20.899
Uh... Oh, yeah.

467
00:33:20.945 --> 00:33:23.403
He just gets nose bleeds
every now and then.

468
00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:24.803
Hey, am I talking to you?

469
00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:29.009
Wait, wait. Ain't
you Keith's kid?

470
00:33:29.034 --> 00:33:31.143
Shit, that is you.
It's Jacob, right?

471
00:33:31.168 --> 00:33:33.668
Jake, yeah. What's up, Carl?

472
00:33:33.709 --> 00:33:35.334
Last time I saw you,

473
00:33:35.376 --> 00:33:38.302
you must have been 11
or 12 at the Crescent.

474
00:33:38.327 --> 00:33:40.077
Your old man loved that bar.

475
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.828
- Always brought you in.
- Yeah.

476
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.787
You know it's a parking
lot now, would you believe?

477
00:33:52.793 --> 00:33:54.654
Goddamn rubbernecks.

478
00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:57.763
How your old man doing?
Haven't seen him in years.

479
00:33:57.788 --> 00:33:59.705
Oh, man, he's doing great.

480
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.521
Yeah, still bowling
every Friday night.

481
00:34:01.547 --> 00:34:03.755
I bet. I tell you what.

482
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.613
Get him to give me a
call. It's been too long.

483
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.019
Yeah, he'd like that.

484
00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:13.224
Shit.

485
00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:25.479
Alright, fellas, I'm gonna
let you be on your way.

486
00:34:26.566 --> 00:34:28.941
Tell Keith I look
forward to catching up.

487
00:34:29.427 --> 00:34:31.668
Thank you. Have a good night.

488
00:34:31.709 --> 00:34:33.418
Get that nose bleed looked at.

489
00:34:33.443 --> 00:34:34.860
Yes, sir.

490
00:34:44.204 --> 00:34:45.942
Your old man's a cop, huh?

491
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.341
No, far from it.

492
00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:50.991
He's just an old drinking buddy.

493
00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:52.777
Fucking small town.

494
00:35:14.918 --> 00:35:17.646
Dad used to take me
and my brother here.

495
00:35:18.078 --> 00:35:20.578
Used to have this roller-coaster
called the Crusher.

496
00:35:20.723 --> 00:35:22.556
So fun, man.

497
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:25.331
We'd wait hours just to
get 30 seconds on it.

498
00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:27.043
So worth it.

499
00:35:28.446 --> 00:35:30.515
He'd leave us there all day.

500
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.123
There was a dog track
about a mile from here.

501
00:35:34.076 --> 00:35:36.618
Never knew what mood
he was gonna be in

502
00:35:36.643 --> 00:35:37.976
when he picked us up.

503
00:35:39.376 --> 00:35:41.376
Is he still around?

504
00:35:41.418 --> 00:35:44.501
Fuck if I know. It's been
years since I've seen him.

505
00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:45.677
Hm.

506
00:35:45.702 --> 00:35:47.244
Probably drank himself to death.

507
00:35:48.782 --> 00:35:50.382
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

508
00:35:53.376 --> 00:35:57.043
The way I figured it is I
can end up just like him,

509
00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:59.990
you know, the way
everyone expects,

510
00:36:00.082 --> 00:36:02.290
or I could say,
"Fuck that shit,"

511
00:36:02.418 --> 00:36:05.418
do my own thing, do it better,

512
00:36:05.614 --> 00:36:07.073
simple as that.

513
00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:10.615
No, I know. Look
who's talking, right?

514
00:36:11.328 --> 00:36:13.786
But all this, everything
I'm up to right now is...

515
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.006
so Hayley has a
better shot, you know?

516
00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:21.349
'Cause she ain't never gonna
forget what I look like.

517
00:36:23.501 --> 00:36:25.168
That's for fucking sure.

518
00:36:35.251 --> 00:36:37.209
That your wife?

519
00:36:37.251 --> 00:36:38.751
Yeah.

520
00:36:40.084 --> 00:36:42.043
She's not happy when
I'm running late.

521
00:36:43.209 --> 00:36:45.293
Fuck, I know that feeling.

522
00:36:47.834 --> 00:36:50.501
You know it's not fair, right?

523
00:36:50.543 --> 00:36:55.293
You know my name now
and I don't know yours.

524
00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:58.251
Would it kill you just
to call yourself John

525
00:36:58.293 --> 00:37:02.091
or Ryan or anything?

526
00:37:02.116 --> 00:37:06.449
Yeah, it's John Ryan.
Good guess, actually.

527
00:37:15.293 --> 00:37:17.001
Didn't these guys
pass us before?

528
00:37:17.043 --> 00:37:19.193
Yeah, I think so.

529
00:37:53.709 --> 00:37:54.950
Fuck.

530
00:37:55.168 --> 00:37:57.543
Shit. He's coming up on us.

531
00:37:57.584 --> 00:37:59.763
Holy shit, he's got a gun!

532
00:38:00.084 --> 00:38:01.668
- Pull over!
- Fuck!

533
00:38:04.043 --> 00:38:05.474
Get up.

534
00:38:20.084 --> 00:38:21.709
Why are they trying to kill us?

535
00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:42.756
Shit! I'm empty.

536
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:44.781
Check... check the glove box.

537
00:38:44.806 --> 00:38:46.722
I got you, I got you.

538
00:38:46.747 --> 00:38:49.705
No, no, no! Shit!
It's empty too, man.

539
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.797
There's nothing else. Shit!

540
00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.365
We're good in here, right?

541
00:39:00.618 --> 00:39:02.076
Where are those guys?

542
00:39:10.376 --> 00:39:11.857
Come on.

543
00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:14.005
Let's go.

544
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.349
There's no route this way!

545
00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.904
Shit!

546
00:39:26.209 --> 00:39:28.084
What? What? What?
Keep it going, man!

547
00:39:28.126 --> 00:39:30.459
Shit.

548
00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.084
Fuck.

549
00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:37.375
This can't be the
plan, man, right?

550
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.400
I mean, can't we, like,
run them over or something?

551
00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:42.834
- Put your hands out the window.
- What?

552
00:39:42.876 --> 00:39:45.334
Just put your hands
out the fucking window!

553
00:39:48.126 --> 00:39:50.043
Put your hands where
I can see them.

554
00:39:51.376 --> 00:39:54.001
And move slowly towards me.

555
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:57.709
I can't die, man. I
can't fucking die.

556
00:39:57.751 --> 00:39:59.450
I c...

557
00:39:59.475 --> 00:40:01.559
Just be cool and get out.

558
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:12.168
Come on, slowly.

559
00:40:16.267 --> 00:40:17.433
Good.

560
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:21.001
You, roll down your sleeves.

561
00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:22.876
What?

562
00:40:22.918 --> 00:40:25.918
I said pull down
your fucking sleeves!

563
00:40:32.293 --> 00:40:33.709
We got you.

564
00:40:37.204 --> 00:40:39.371
We fucking got you.

565
00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:44.751
Shit.

566
00:40:45.183 --> 00:40:46.411
We got him!

567
00:41:03.668 --> 00:41:04.876
You're not so fucking tough

568
00:41:04.918 --> 00:41:06.247
without your fucking
shotgun, are you?

569
00:41:06.272 --> 00:41:08.622
Fuck, here we go.

570
00:41:09.287 --> 00:41:10.996
Yeah.

571
00:41:12.876 --> 00:41:14.209
Is that him?

572
00:41:20.066 --> 00:41:21.774
Say something.

573
00:41:24.863 --> 00:41:26.488
What do you want me to say?

574
00:41:27.668 --> 00:41:29.168
Tell me you're gonna...

575
00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:32.480
blow my fucking head off.

576
00:41:33.388 --> 00:41:34.621
Say it.

577
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:38.750
I'm gonna blow your
fucking head off.

578
00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:44.107
It's not him, man. It's not him.

579
00:41:44.959 --> 00:41:46.886
He's just the driver, man.

580
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:49.661
I was there, I can tell
you that's not him.

581
00:41:50.543 --> 00:41:53.168
I don't know the guy's name,
who you're looking for,

582
00:41:53.193 --> 00:41:55.918
but I can tell
you we had no idea

583
00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:58.293
he was gonna pull that
fucking shit out, OK?

584
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:05.752
What about you?
You know his name?

585
00:42:05.777 --> 00:42:07.185
No.

586
00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.168
What about my money?

587
00:42:11.209 --> 00:42:13.251
You know what
happened to my money?

588
00:42:13.293 --> 00:42:16.168
No, they don't tell me
that shit. I'm the driver.

589
00:42:16.209 --> 00:42:17.543
Hmm.

590
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:27.251
You don't have
a lot to say, do you?

591
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.623
What if I gouge your
fucking eyes out?

592
00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:31.981
Will you talk then?

593
00:42:35.764 --> 00:42:37.847
Oh, look at that.
Maybe you got a wife.

594
00:42:37.872 --> 00:42:40.161
Maybe I should pay
her a call, huh?

595
00:42:40.669 --> 00:42:41.808
You fucking...

596
00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:44.918
You, get down on your
fucking hands and knees.

597
00:42:44.959 --> 00:42:46.227
Get down on
your fucking knees.

598
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:47.584
The fuck you looking here for?

599
00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:49.043
Get on your fucking knees!

600
00:42:49.084 --> 00:42:51.209
Can... can we please
talk about this?

601
00:42:51.251 --> 00:42:53.168
Hmm, OK.

602
00:42:54.168 --> 00:42:56.668
I had a little...

603
00:42:56.709 --> 00:43:00.084
I had a little head
injury recently

604
00:43:00.126 --> 00:43:03.418
so I wanna be quite
sure I got this clear.

605
00:43:04.668 --> 00:43:06.126
You don't have my money,

606
00:43:06.168 --> 00:43:08.126
don't know the name of the guy

607
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:10.668
that turned my head
into a fucking piñata.

608
00:43:10.709 --> 00:43:14.261
We can figure that out.
We can find the guy.

609
00:43:14.286 --> 00:43:17.019
We can find his name, give
you the money, all that.

610
00:43:17.044 --> 00:43:19.918
- But if you kill us...
- If I kill you?

611
00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:21.501
If I kill you?

612
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:25.590
I thought I made it clear

613
00:43:25.615 --> 00:43:29.793
that nobody steals from
me and gets to live.

614
00:43:29.834 --> 00:43:32.308
Nobody? What about him?

615
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.404
The fuck you talking about?

616
00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:38.363
Is he the exception,
this piece of shit, huh?

617
00:43:38.388 --> 00:43:40.126
Why don't you ask your boy

618
00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:41.669
how they knew what was
in the safe, Frank.

619
00:43:41.694 --> 00:43:43.486
- Shut the fuck up!
- Huh? Go ahead, Frank.

620
00:43:43.668 --> 00:43:45.675
Ask him about his deal.

621
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.310
- Dad, he's a fucking liar.
- Why don't you tell him, Shaun?

622
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:49.376
How much of the cut
had your name on it?

623
00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:50.769
- Don't listen to this shit!
- I'm guessing half.

624
00:43:50.793 --> 00:43:52.144
- Think it was half?
- Shut the fuck up!

625
00:43:52.168 --> 00:43:54.084
- I'm thinking half.
- Shut the fuck up.

626
00:43:55.084 --> 00:43:58.209
You fucked me over?

627
00:43:58.251 --> 00:44:01.084
No. No, no, no.
It's not like that.

628
00:44:01.126 --> 00:44:03.126
- It's not.
- Don't you lie to me.

629
00:44:03.168 --> 00:44:05.584
- I'm not.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

630
00:44:06.834 --> 00:44:08.543
You fucking weasel.

631
00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:10.781
My own son.

632
00:44:11.755 --> 00:44:13.862
You piece of shit.

633
00:44:20.543 --> 00:44:23.793
You should have... you
should have killed me.

634
00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:26.709
You should have
fucking killed me!

635
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:29.251
I didn't want to fucking
kill you, alright?

636
00:44:29.293 --> 00:44:31.668
That was the fucking
deal! You fucked it up!

637
00:44:31.709 --> 00:44:33.126
Why'd you say you
wanted him dead?

638
00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:34.269
- I didn't fucking say that.
- Bullshit!

639
00:44:34.293 --> 00:44:35.709
You said you wanted him dead.

640
00:44:35.751 --> 00:44:37.543
You shut the fuck
up. Shut the fuck up!

641
00:44:37.584 --> 00:44:39.876
- "Kill him and take it all."
- Stop fucking lying!

642
00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:43.126
Hey, I heard, "Kill
him, take it all.".

643
00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:44.947
That's what I heard, Frank.

644
00:44:44.972 --> 00:44:46.638
- He said...
- Fuck!

645
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.676
- Alright.
- Hey!

646
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.209
Fuck!

647
00:44:52.584 --> 00:44:55.543
Now, we kill these fucks

648
00:44:56.185 --> 00:44:58.918
and then we talk.

649
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.805
Dad, hold him!

650
00:45:12.394 --> 00:45:13.685
Ugh!

651
00:45:44.216 --> 00:45:45.450
Ugh!

652
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.175
You did good.

653
00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:33.075
Oh...

654
00:48:27.417 --> 00:48:29.875
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

655
00:48:29.996 --> 00:48:31.746
Hey, what's going
on? What's going on?

656
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.386
Hey, hey.

657
00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.957
What's going on? You alright?

658
00:48:35.982 --> 00:48:38.668
I can't...

659
00:48:38.709 --> 00:48:41.126
- Huh? What?
- I can't... I can't breathe.

660
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.918
Just sit back, sit
back, sit back.

661
00:48:43.724 --> 00:48:44.730
- I need my inhaler.
- Hey, hey, hey.

662
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:45.876
Listen to me, listen to me.

663
00:48:45.918 --> 00:48:47.449
- I need my inhaler.
- Just breathe, breathe.

664
00:48:47.474 --> 00:48:49.293
- I can't...
- Just take a breath.

665
00:48:49.334 --> 00:48:51.459
Take a breath, take a breath.

666
00:48:51.501 --> 00:48:54.001
- Hey, hey, just... just relax.
- I need my inhaler.

667
00:48:54.043 --> 00:48:55.543
I can't...

668
00:48:55.584 --> 00:48:57.668
Where the fuck is it?

669
00:48:58.747 --> 00:48:59.754
I need it.

670
00:48:59.779 --> 00:49:01.777
Hey, calm down, calm down.

671
00:49:01.802 --> 00:49:04.496
Just breathe, breathe,
alright? Just relax.

672
00:49:04.521 --> 00:49:06.340
Alright, just... Hey, hey.

673
00:49:06.365 --> 00:49:07.927
Think about your
daughter, alright?

674
00:49:07.972 --> 00:49:09.472
It's Hayley, yeah?

675
00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:14.205
I remember you saying that
because that's my sister's name.

676
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:15.980
Hayley, it's a pretty name.

677
00:49:16.085 --> 00:49:18.953
Just relax, OK?

678
00:49:18.978 --> 00:49:20.561
Just breathe.

679
00:49:25.177 --> 00:49:26.593
Just breathe.

680
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:34.104
Calm down.

681
00:49:38.274 --> 00:49:39.899
You OK?

682
00:49:44.755 --> 00:49:47.755
Man... I can't have
you dying in here.

683
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.005
This is my father's car.

684
00:49:50.114 --> 00:49:51.905
This was his pride and joy.

685
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:55.042
You OK?

686
00:50:02.639 --> 00:50:03.806
Can you tell me about him?

687
00:50:04.774 --> 00:50:06.399
Yeah, he was nice.

688
00:50:07.184 --> 00:50:10.059
Kinda too nice, you know?

689
00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:12.499
That was his weakness.

690
00:50:12.524 --> 00:50:14.482
He always saw the
best in everyone.

691
00:50:16.344 --> 00:50:18.341
That doesn't
sound like a weakness.

692
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:22.664
Well, people are assholes.
You know, they take advantage.

693
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.786
He'd go out of his
way to help everyone,

694
00:50:27.063 --> 00:50:28.896
spread himself too thin.

695
00:50:30.581 --> 00:50:32.331
It nearly cost him his marriage.

696
00:50:36.404 --> 00:50:39.124
I remember when I went
away for a few years,

697
00:50:39.149 --> 00:50:41.441
I asked him not
to, but he would...

698
00:50:41.466 --> 00:50:45.234
he would drive five hours
round trip every weekend

699
00:50:45.259 --> 00:50:48.842
for a 20-minute
visitation, every weekend.

700
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:56.088
And he had every reason to look
at me like a piece of shit,

701
00:50:56.113 --> 00:50:57.654
but he never did.

702
00:50:59.618 --> 00:51:01.618
He just kept me going.

703
00:51:03.609 --> 00:51:05.484
Yeah, well...

704
00:51:05.509 --> 00:51:07.676
The rest of my family
wasn't so kind.

705
00:51:08.978 --> 00:51:11.436
Anyway, this is all
I got left of him.

706
00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:17.192
So don't slam the doors.

707
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:24.190
You alright?

708
00:51:25.988 --> 00:51:27.196
Yeah.

709
00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:30.634
I'm alright.

710
00:51:31.571 --> 00:51:33.571
They were gonna kill us.
You know that, right?

711
00:51:34.915 --> 00:51:36.457
There's nothing we
could have said.

712
00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:41.957
You did the right thing.

713
00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:44.059
If you didn't do what you did,

714
00:51:44.716 --> 00:51:47.467
we'd both be laying down out
there face down right now

715
00:51:47.492 --> 00:51:49.534
instead of them.

716
00:51:51.272 --> 00:51:52.689
OK?

717
00:51:57.284 --> 00:51:58.617
I gotta make a phone call,

718
00:51:58.642 --> 00:52:00.350
let them know we're
gonna be late.

719
00:52:00.375 --> 00:52:02.855
Just relax, keep breathing.

720
00:52:19.174 --> 00:52:21.132
<i>Alright, smart-ass,
where the fuck are you?</i>

721
00:52:21.157 --> 00:52:24.074
You put her on. No more
fucking around. Put her on!

722
00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:26.599
<i>Oh, this better be good.</i>

723
00:52:26.624 --> 00:52:28.909
<i>- Yeah, he's on.</i>
<i>- You're late.</i>

724
00:52:28.934 --> 00:52:31.018
Did you know Frank
was still alive?

725
00:52:31.762 --> 00:52:34.178
<i>- What?</i>
- Well, he was.

726
00:52:34.834 --> 00:52:36.896
I don't know how
they tracked us down,

727
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:39.458
but this shit didn't end well.

728
00:52:40.546 --> 00:52:42.410
<i>This mess keeps getting worse.</i>

729
00:52:42.435 --> 00:52:44.332
None of this shit
would have happened

730
00:52:44.357 --> 00:52:47.816
if Leon hadn't acted
like a goddamn maniac.

731
00:52:48.203 --> 00:52:50.738
And now Shaun is dead,
he doesn't need his cut.

732
00:52:50.763 --> 00:52:54.847
So who gives a shit
about a missing 25 grand?

733
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.699
Why can't we just call this?

734
00:52:56.724 --> 00:52:58.636
<i>Are you telling me
how to run things?</i>

735
00:52:58.661 --> 00:53:00.332
<i>Is that what you do now?</i>

736
00:53:00.357 --> 00:53:03.655
<i>Do me a favour. Don't forget
who you're talking to.</i>

737
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.091
Listen, I understand.
It's just that...

738
00:53:07.052 --> 00:53:10.677
This kid, he handled
himself well.

739
00:53:11.657 --> 00:53:13.699
He had my back. He was great.

740
00:53:15.245 --> 00:53:16.870
Can't we just call this?

741
00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:20.434
<i>Bring him to me. I
just wanna talk to him.</i>

742
00:53:21.387 --> 00:53:22.821
<i>Turn up without him</i>

743
00:53:22.846 --> 00:53:25.044
<i>and you're gonna wish
that Frank had killed you.</i>

744
00:54:08.951 --> 00:54:10.534
I found your thing.

745
00:54:12.026 --> 00:54:13.318
Thanks.

746
00:54:13.592 --> 00:54:15.342
Where'd you get that?

747
00:54:16.359 --> 00:54:19.568
- You going through my shit?
- No, it fell out.

748
00:54:24.318 --> 00:54:25.568
This your son?

749
00:54:26.526 --> 00:54:28.151
Yeah.

750
00:54:29.651 --> 00:54:33.651
What's he, like... seven, eight?

751
00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:38.484
No, he's about 15 now.

752
00:54:40.169 --> 00:54:42.252
- 15?
- Mm-hm.

753
00:54:46.401 --> 00:54:47.693
Hey.

754
00:54:49.693 --> 00:54:52.318
Hmm.

755
00:54:52.359 --> 00:54:53.818
Wow.

756
00:54:55.984 --> 00:54:58.859
Hey, uh, I just...

757
00:55:01.542 --> 00:55:02.834
wanna say thanks for...

758
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:08.484
helping me breathe there.

759
00:55:10.484 --> 00:55:12.818
- Yep.
- Thanks.

760
00:55:54.146 --> 00:55:56.243
Yeah, we just landed.
They're headed your way.

761
00:55:56.268 --> 00:55:58.323
He's gonna need stitching up.

762
00:55:58.348 --> 00:56:00.223
I'll deal with the car.

763
00:56:04.568 --> 00:56:06.401
Jesus fucking Christ!

764
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:10.109
What are we gonna do
about that shit, huh?!

765
00:56:10.416 --> 00:56:12.416
Keep your voice
down. Help him out.

766
00:56:17.984 --> 00:56:19.609
Don't you
fucking touch me.

767
00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:21.068
Let's go.

768
00:56:23.206 --> 00:56:25.289
You got two minutes
to get to the pickup.

769
00:56:25.314 --> 00:56:26.897
I got it, I got it.

770
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.544
Do you still take
your kid fishing?

771
00:57:14.263 --> 00:57:16.388
Yeah, from time to time.

772
00:57:18.359 --> 00:57:22.732
Yeah, I mean, I used
to go up... Mill Creek.

773
00:57:22.757 --> 00:57:24.550
There's some good
carp over there.

774
00:57:26.826 --> 00:57:29.951
My dad was the only one that
caught the fish, though.

775
00:57:31.052 --> 00:57:32.552
I'd hold the camera.

776
00:57:35.818 --> 00:57:37.776
We'd go out, like,
every Sunday morning.

777
00:57:39.232 --> 00:57:41.732
He'd show up at the door

778
00:57:41.757 --> 00:57:43.799
in this shitty car...

779
00:57:45.875 --> 00:57:47.750
honking a mile away.

780
00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:53.970
He was always late.

781
00:57:55.861 --> 00:57:57.236
Huh.

782
00:57:58.572 --> 00:58:00.405
One day I was sitting
in the driveway

783
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:02.081
a little longer than usual.

784
00:58:04.187 --> 00:58:06.104
An hour goes by.

785
00:58:07.799 --> 00:58:09.341
Another hour.

786
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:13.955
And I just knew he
wasn't gonna show up.

787
00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:19.648
And he didn't...

788
00:58:21.857 --> 00:58:23.607
12 years ago.

789
00:58:30.284 --> 00:58:31.808
Who fucking just disappears

790
00:58:31.833 --> 00:58:34.833
on their kid like
that, you know?

791
00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:40.802
I'm
gonna take Hayley,

792
00:58:40.827 --> 00:58:42.660
go make some new memories,

793
00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:44.601
pave right over the old ones.

794
00:58:47.187 --> 00:58:49.271
<i>Ad Meliora.</i>

795
00:58:51.803 --> 00:58:55.011
Latin or some shit. It
means 'new beginnings'.

796
00:58:55.036 --> 00:58:57.995
My mom had it tatted on her arm.

797
00:59:01.381 --> 00:59:03.172
She probably didn't
even know what it meant.

798
00:59:06.651 --> 00:59:09.443
I liked it. It gave
me hope, you know?

799
00:59:09.484 --> 00:59:11.425
Made me think of a new future.

800
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.140
Yeah, I think it's,
<i>"Semper ad meliora."</i>

801
00:59:17.248 --> 00:59:18.914
"Towards better things."

802
00:59:20.038 --> 00:59:21.413
It's nice.

803
00:59:25.052 --> 00:59:27.052
"Towards better things."

804
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.753
What else is your kid into?

805
00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.138
He's a teenager.

806
00:59:36.163 --> 00:59:37.705
He likes to drive fast.

807
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.593
I take him out in
this sometimes.

808
00:59:42.702 --> 00:59:44.244
This will be his one day.

809
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:48.341
Ah, lucky him.

810
00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:50.880
It's a nice car to learn in.

811
00:59:52.808 --> 00:59:54.767
Be careful, though.

812
00:59:54.792 --> 00:59:58.501
He's gonna be stealing your keys
and taking those girls out soon.

813
01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:02.573
Is he already doing that?

814
01:00:08.055 --> 01:00:09.847
Oh, man, I am not
looking forward

815
01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.456
to Hayley being that age.

816
01:00:13.523 --> 01:00:16.607
Stuff I was doing at 15? Mn-mn.

817
01:00:19.173 --> 01:00:20.965
I'm gonna be scaring
off every asshole

818
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.698
that comes knocking, man.

819
01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:28.728
Patting my hand with a
baseball bat, redneck style.

820
01:00:31.273 --> 01:00:33.440
Ain't nobody's good
enough for her.

821
01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.510
Not in this town anyway.

822
01:00:57.631 --> 01:00:59.482
I just hope she never finds
out I killed somebody.

823
01:00:59.507 --> 01:01:01.257
At least that's for sure.

824
01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:11.779
So much for Batman.

825
01:01:35.635 --> 01:01:37.135
Where would you go?

826
01:01:40.271 --> 01:01:41.812
What?

827
01:01:43.019 --> 01:01:44.409
Where would you go?

828
01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.954
You said you wanted
to get out of here.

829
01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:50.317
Start a better life with
you and your daughter.

830
01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:53.065
Where would you go?

831
01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.587
I don't think I'm
supposed to tell you that.

832
01:02:00.612 --> 01:02:02.109
See, I'm catching on.

833
01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.901
Just forget all
that shit, alright?

834
01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:07.309
Have you got someplace
where you got family?

835
01:02:07.334 --> 01:02:09.000
Someplace you can go?

836
01:02:10.155 --> 01:02:13.362
Anywhere you... you
could go if you had to?

837
01:02:15.987 --> 01:02:18.866
Man, you've gotta be thinking
about your next move, alright?

838
01:02:19.484 --> 01:02:20.822
What are you talking about?

839
01:02:22.647 --> 01:02:24.105
Hey, we've gotta go, man.

840
01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:25.650
You've got a green.

841
01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:38.058
You OK?

842
01:02:44.893 --> 01:02:47.560
Yo!

843
01:02:50.779 --> 01:02:52.237
You lost?

844
01:02:53.229 --> 01:02:55.604
Oh, this joker.

845
01:02:55.825 --> 01:02:57.825
After you.

846
01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:02.528
Glad to see he made
a quick recovery.

847
01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:04.137
Fucking ass.

848
01:03:36.607 --> 01:03:37.940
Fuck it.

849
01:04:10.934 --> 01:04:12.350
Nice place.

850
01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:56.466
Phew!

851
01:04:59.127 --> 01:05:00.585
Alright?

852
01:05:05.914 --> 01:05:07.248
She's waiting.

853
01:05:08.442 --> 01:05:09.775
Better make a run for it.

854
01:05:12.345 --> 01:05:14.637
Hey, hey...

855
01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:28.662
She ain't happy.

856
01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:32.676
Alright, hold up, gentlemen.

857
01:05:38.314 --> 01:05:41.314
Come on.

858
01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:43.675
- Easy, asshole.
- Whoa. Sorry.

859
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.533
Got a boo-boo there, princess?

860
01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:48.198
OK.

861
01:05:48.223 --> 01:05:50.348
You, come on. Spread them, kid.

862
01:05:55.148 --> 01:05:56.564
Alright.

863
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:58.427
What the fuck is this?

864
01:05:58.452 --> 01:06:01.119
- It's my inhaler.
- He needs it.

865
01:06:02.557 --> 01:06:03.932
Right.

866
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.924
Come on.

867
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:18.569
Alright.

868
01:06:19.955 --> 01:06:21.538
The fuck happened to you?

869
01:06:23.307 --> 01:06:25.284
Come on. You're late.

870
01:06:26.132 --> 01:06:28.507
You know that pisses
her off, right?

871
01:06:32.101 --> 01:06:34.060
Jimmy, nice work on
the Highland job.

872
01:06:34.085 --> 01:06:36.125
- Cheers, boss.
- Don't fuck up the next one.

873
01:06:36.651 --> 01:06:38.520
Oi, back to work, motherfucker!

874
01:06:38.545 --> 01:06:39.961
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.

875
01:06:39.986 --> 01:06:42.722
Fuck me. Amateurs.

876
01:06:45.253 --> 01:06:47.397
And what part of that
is my fucking problem?

877
01:06:47.422 --> 01:06:49.131
If you did your job
in the first place,

878
01:06:49.156 --> 01:06:50.507
he wouldn't be
sitting in a jail cell

879
01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:52.131
right now ready to talk.

880
01:06:52.156 --> 01:06:53.781
Just finish what you started.

881
01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:56.589
Morons.

882
01:06:58.562 --> 01:07:00.175
You made it!

883
01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:04.434
Hell of a night.

884
01:07:06.372 --> 01:07:08.018
We've not met.

885
01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:10.954
You know who I am?

886
01:07:10.979 --> 01:07:13.486
Yeah. I mean, yes, ma'am.

887
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:16.603
Good. Tanner had a
lot to say about you.

888
01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:19.901
I only work with people
who come recommended.

889
01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:23.698
Must be nice to finally
make some real money.

890
01:07:24.097 --> 01:07:26.609
Yeah, very thankful for
the, uh, opportunities.

891
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.609
Yeah, well, you
held yourself well.

892
01:07:28.651 --> 01:07:33.177
You keep doing what you're
doing and you'll go places.

893
01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:34.997
Thanks.

894
01:07:36.169 --> 01:07:39.169
You had an eventful
journey, I hear.

895
01:07:39.818 --> 01:07:42.060
Oh, it was eventful.

896
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.988
Any idea how they found us?

897
01:07:45.013 --> 01:07:47.971
No, this town has some
big mouths. You know that.

898
01:07:49.656 --> 01:07:51.615
So you killed Shaun?

899
01:07:53.776 --> 01:07:57.027
- Yeah, he did good.
- Yeah.

900
01:07:57.052 --> 01:08:00.544
Yeah, well, better
off without him.

901
01:08:00.569 --> 01:08:02.569
He sold out his own
father for what? 200?

902
01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:04.779
Daddy issues, I'm sure.

903
01:08:05.365 --> 01:08:07.948
Probably just wanted to
see him taken down a peg.

904
01:08:13.678 --> 01:08:14.950
You know...

905
01:08:17.115 --> 01:08:20.599
that conscience of yours
is gonna get you nowhere.

906
01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.421
You like spiders?

907
01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:30.004
No, actually.

908
01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:33.276
It's a stupid face-your-fears
kind of thing.

909
01:08:33.966 --> 01:08:36.079
My daughter actually makes
me wear long sleeves.

910
01:08:36.104 --> 01:08:37.771
- I'll probably change it.
- Yeah.

911
01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.771
What would you get?

912
01:08:41.068 --> 01:08:45.035
I don't know. I was
thinking maybe an eagle.

913
01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.333
Oh, bird of prey!

914
01:08:47.763 --> 01:08:49.832
Yeah, not afraid of birds, then?

915
01:08:49.857 --> 01:08:52.910
- Not birds.
- Nah, beautiful creatures.

916
01:08:52.943 --> 01:08:55.355
So many different species,

917
01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.776
each with their own
unique characteristics.

918
01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:00.923
A bird in nature,

919
01:09:00.948 --> 01:09:04.406
now, that is the ultimate
symbol of freedom.

920
01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:08.515
Well, let me ask you something.

921
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.915
One suddenly flies
into your home

922
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.878
and starts squawking at you
from the kitchen counter.

923
01:09:12.903 --> 01:09:14.278
What do you do?

924
01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:19.924
You lose your fucking
mind. That's what!

925
01:09:19.949 --> 01:09:21.425
You leave the room,
you lock the door,

926
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.876
you panic, they panic.

927
01:09:24.398 --> 01:09:26.982
They become unpredictable

928
01:09:27.007 --> 01:09:30.049
because it's not their habitat.

929
01:09:31.057 --> 01:09:33.307
It's not where they belong.

930
01:09:35.565 --> 01:09:37.232
So let me ask you...

931
01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:41.209
is this where you belong

932
01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:43.494
or are you unpredictable?

933
01:09:53.054 --> 01:09:55.388
No, I... I belong.

934
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.118
I mean, I think this is...

935
01:09:58.143 --> 01:10:01.816
I'm just fucking with you. I
do with all the new recruits.

936
01:10:01.841 --> 01:10:04.924
Alright, let's get
down to it. 75 each.

937
01:10:07.327 --> 01:10:11.161
And 50 for the recruit.

938
01:10:16.974 --> 01:10:18.390
Thanks.

939
01:10:23.268 --> 01:10:24.893
Hey, new guy.

940
01:10:27.772 --> 01:10:29.481
Aren't you gonna count it?

941
01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:34.565
- I'm good. I trust you guys.
- Oh, come on.

942
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:36.798
It's our first time
working together.

943
01:10:36.823 --> 01:10:39.531
Let me give you
a word of advice.

944
01:10:39.556 --> 01:10:41.833
Never be too polite
to count your take.

945
01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:47.661
- I mean, it's... it's no problem.
- There should be 50 in there.

946
01:10:48.205 --> 01:10:51.080
Go ahead. Count. You earned it.

947
01:10:54.003 --> 01:10:55.466
If that's OK with you?

948
01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:57.435
No, I insist.

949
01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:15.833
There's only 25 in here.

950
01:11:16.187 --> 01:11:19.437
25? Not 50?

951
01:11:20.769 --> 01:11:23.630
Yeah, I mean, I
counted it twice.

952
01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:27.654
Oh, that's right. I gave
you an advance on that 25.

953
01:11:29.272 --> 01:11:31.189
You know, that money,

954
01:11:31.319 --> 01:11:33.527
probably been spending
all around town.

955
01:11:33.552 --> 01:11:34.927
It could be traceable.

956
01:11:35.132 --> 01:11:36.882
You see, we have a process here

957
01:11:36.907 --> 01:11:39.166
and you fucked up that process.

958
01:11:39.883 --> 01:11:42.603
What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

959
01:11:43.194 --> 01:11:46.338
What you looking at him for?
He's not gonna help you.

960
01:11:48.949 --> 01:11:50.891
I didn't steal
any fucking money.

961
01:11:50.916 --> 01:11:52.390
I'm not that stupid, OK?

962
01:11:52.415 --> 01:11:54.790
I would never do that
to you guys, alright?

963
01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:57.690
I wouldn't, OK?
Jesus fucking Christ.

964
01:11:57.715 --> 01:12:00.298
I mean, fuck, I would
never fucking steal...

965
01:12:00.323 --> 01:12:02.323
Hey, get off him!

966
01:12:02.348 --> 01:12:03.431
Get off him!

967
01:12:05.718 --> 01:12:07.176
Get the fuck off him.

968
01:12:07.217 --> 01:12:09.050
You don't know what
was in Frank's safe!

969
01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:12.117
You weren't there.
You don't know.

970
01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.525
Get him up.

971
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:15.591
You gonna trust
Shaun over the kid?

972
01:12:19.152 --> 01:12:22.110
Let him up! He said
he didn't do it!

973
01:12:33.045 --> 01:12:34.439
He can't breathe.

974
01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:37.315
He can't breathe.
Give him his pipe.

975
01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.408
This?

976
01:12:42.585 --> 01:12:44.252
He can't breathe!

977
01:12:46.604 --> 01:12:48.197
Let him up!

978
01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.346
Please...

979
01:12:52.457 --> 01:12:53.707
Get off him!

980
01:12:54.456 --> 01:12:55.748
I can't die, man.

981
01:12:55.773 --> 01:12:57.648
Let him up! Oh!

982
01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:00.382
Take the money from my cut!

983
01:13:00.407 --> 01:13:02.491
Fuck, get off of him!

984
01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:03.891
Get off him!

985
01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:05.458
Enough!

986
01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:09.275
Just listen to him.
Just let him talk.

987
01:13:12.897 --> 01:13:14.517
Leon.

988
01:13:15.428 --> 01:13:17.189
Leon, stay the fuck out of it.

989
01:13:17.453 --> 01:13:19.453
He fucked
you over too.

990
01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:22.126
You do the honours.

991
01:13:23.494 --> 01:13:26.827
Leon, stay the fuck
out of it. Leon!

992
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.412
Oh! Oh, fuck!

993
01:13:30.959 --> 01:13:32.959
What the fuck, man?!

994
01:13:32.984 --> 01:13:35.234
"No-one gets hurt," I said.

995
01:13:35.506 --> 01:13:38.297
I'm putting out fires here
and you're starting new ones.

996
01:13:38.322 --> 01:13:40.408
Frank was holding money
for a lot of people.

997
01:13:40.433 --> 01:13:41.808
If anyone finds out about

998
01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:43.680
my part in this thing,
you started a war...

999
01:13:43.705 --> 01:13:44.792
I'm sorry.

1000
01:13:44.817 --> 01:13:47.346
A war you won't
be around to see.

1001
01:13:47.639 --> 01:13:48.994
No, please!

1002
01:14:00.195 --> 01:14:02.275
Help, please!

1003
01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:14.471
You know, you're alright.

1004
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:17.708
You're a thieving piece of
shit, but I kinda like you.

1005
01:14:17.733 --> 01:14:20.067
He said
he didn't take it.

1006
01:14:20.453 --> 01:14:22.995
You could've made
some serious money,

1007
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.770
but you got greedy.

1008
01:14:26.174 --> 01:14:29.633
You see, my business
is built on trust.

1009
01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:31.713
And if I can't trust you...

1010
01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:35.290
Oh, fuck.

1011
01:14:36.031 --> 01:14:38.532
I can't leave her.
I can't leave her!

1012
01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.000
Then you're fuckin' dead to me.

1013
01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:43.602
Fuck! Oh!

1014
01:15:03.743 --> 01:15:08.857
Now, you wanna die tonight
or you wanna get paid?

1015
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.641
You vindictive bitch.

1016
01:15:14.804 --> 01:15:16.891
Alright, back off him.

1017
01:15:23.169 --> 01:15:26.127
Keep that phone on
you. I'll be in touch.

1018
01:15:33.681 --> 01:15:35.141
Take it.

1019
01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.487
Alright, I want
those bodies moved.

1020
01:15:51.512 --> 01:15:53.263
I want the bikes ditched.

1021
01:17:16.351 --> 01:17:17.768
Hey!

1022
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.727
Going somewhere?

1023
01:17:36.679 --> 01:17:38.273
Fuck.

1024
01:18:00.818 --> 01:18:03.151
Fuck! Fuck!

1025
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:24.527
Huh!

1026
01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:49.107
You wanna fucking dance?

1027
01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:11.041
Fuck!

1028
01:19:14.147 --> 01:19:15.388
Arggh!

1029
01:19:26.677 --> 01:19:28.302
Fuck you!

1030
01:19:28.327 --> 01:19:30.240
Ugh!

1031
01:20:35.019 --> 01:20:37.352
Oh, fuck!

1032
01:20:43.497 --> 01:20:44.996
<i>It feels
like you've been avoiding me...</i>

1033
01:20:45.021 --> 01:20:46.604
<i>been avoiding me...</i>

1034
01:20:46.904 --> 01:20:49.044
<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

1035
01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.303
<i>My buddy here's a driver too.</i>

1036
01:20:53.535 --> 01:20:54.970
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1037
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:56.828
<i>Tell Eric where we're heading.</i>

1038
01:20:57.651 --> 01:20:59.443
<i>I don't have it, Janko.</i>

1039
01:20:59.468 --> 01:21:01.427
<i>I need more time.</i>

1040
01:21:01.452 --> 01:21:03.619
<i>There's a job I can take
in a couple of weeks.</i>

1041
01:21:03.644 --> 01:21:05.560
<i>I just need time
to clean the money.</i>

1042
01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.253
<i>You got two minutes
to get to the pickup.</i>

1043
01:21:09.278 --> 01:21:10.444
<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

1044
01:21:12.943 --> 01:21:16.068
<i>For old times' sake,
next time we meet,</i>

1045
01:21:16.093 --> 01:21:17.927
<i>you better have my cash.</i>

1046
01:21:26.999 --> 01:21:28.791
You just gonna let him go?

1047
01:21:28.816 --> 01:21:32.013
No, I just wanted him to
hurt a little bit longer.

1048
01:21:32.437 --> 01:21:35.934
<i>Remember... remember...</i>

1049
01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:38.001
<i>you always have more to lose.</i>

1050
01:21:39.834 --> 01:21:41.459
<i>Say hi to your boy for me.</i>

1051
01:21:57.694 --> 01:21:59.610
Oh, fuck!

1052
01:21:59.635 --> 01:22:02.343
Fuck.

1053
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.695
Oh, fuck!

1054
01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:56.235
OK.

1055
01:24:06.434 --> 01:24:07.809
Yeah, it's done.

1056
01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:10.296
<i>What about the money?</i>

1057
01:24:10.321 --> 01:24:12.165
Oh, shit. Yeah, hang on.

1058
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:15.794
Get the fuck out.

1059
01:24:17.893 --> 01:24:19.643
Yeah, it's all there.

1060
01:24:39.044 --> 01:24:40.401
<i>Hello?</i>

1061
01:24:45.969 --> 01:24:47.761
<i>Still with me?</i>

1062
01:24:52.285 --> 01:24:55.518
<i>You're still breathing.
Good for you.</i>

1063
01:24:56.517 --> 01:24:58.117
You know, you should
have come to me

1064
01:24:58.142 --> 01:24:59.767
about your debt with Janko.

1065
01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:02.221
I would have given you the
money, no questions asked.

1066
01:25:02.666 --> 01:25:05.208
<i>But did you really think
you could steal from me?</i>

1067
01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:07.775
If you knew it was me,
why would you kill him?

1068
01:25:08.022 --> 01:25:10.549
Huh? Why did you kill the kid?!

1069
01:25:10.865 --> 01:25:12.865
I killed him?

1070
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.557
You knew what was
waiting for him.

1071
01:25:14.582 --> 01:25:17.135
You had plenty of
chances to come forward.

1072
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:20.901
<i>I read people. That's
how I got to where I am.</i>

1073
01:25:20.926 --> 01:25:23.218
<i>The kid was soft.
You saw it yourself.</i>

1074
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:25.447
Oh, he was fine running
drugs for Tanner

1075
01:25:25.472 --> 01:25:27.097
and all that
small-time bullshit,

1076
01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.649
but he would have caved,

1077
01:25:29.674 --> 01:25:31.216
gone running to the cops

1078
01:25:31.241 --> 01:25:33.021
or gotten someone killed

1079
01:25:33.046 --> 01:25:35.213
for not doing what it
takes to get shit done.

1080
01:25:36.017 --> 01:25:39.682
<i>But you, you are the one person</i>

1081
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.158
<i>I've never been able to read.</i>

1082
01:25:42.815 --> 01:25:46.690
Your wife, she gets mowed down,

1083
01:25:46.715 --> 01:25:48.900
left for dead by some
low-life crack whore

1084
01:25:48.925 --> 01:25:51.133
and you don't do shit about it.

1085
01:25:54.213 --> 01:25:56.521
Don't talk about my wife.

1086
01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.059
I tracked her down for you.

1087
01:25:59.873 --> 01:26:02.540
I gifted her to you
on a fucking plate.

1088
01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:05.094
So much rage behind the eyes.

1089
01:26:05.119 --> 01:26:08.476
<i>But you couldn't unleash it.</i>

1090
01:26:08.501 --> 01:26:11.560
Instead, you begged me
to let her go!

1091
01:26:13.027 --> 01:26:14.402
Yeah.

1092
01:26:15.566 --> 01:26:17.941
I never understood you.

1093
01:26:18.426 --> 01:26:21.693
<i>But now I see
exactly who you are.</i>

1094
01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.706
<i>You are fucking cold.</i>

1095
01:26:24.731 --> 01:26:28.474
And now you got that
kid's blood on your hands.

1096
01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:32.886
Now, it's been a long night,

1097
01:26:32.911 --> 01:26:37.777
so I'll spare you the big
speech about hunting you down.

1098
01:26:38.262 --> 01:26:41.004
<i>You know how this ends.</i>

1099
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.987
Yeah, I know how it works.

1100
01:26:43.012 --> 01:26:45.220
I know your every movement.

1101
01:26:45.245 --> 01:26:47.828
I know everybody
you've fucked over.

1102
01:26:47.853 --> 01:26:49.978
This whole town's
gonna know soon.

1103
01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:53.346
You're living on
borrowed time, lady,

1104
01:26:53.446 --> 01:26:55.362
so you better find me.

1105
01:26:55.387 --> 01:26:58.345
You won't make it
through the night.

1106
01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:01.354
You got nowhere to go.

1107
01:27:01.379 --> 01:27:03.379
You better kill me quick.

1108
01:27:35.366 --> 01:27:36.825
Fuck!

1109
01:27:37.903 --> 01:27:39.944
Fuck!

1110
01:28:21.684 --> 01:28:23.725
<i>This is Officer Morales.</i>

1111
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.802
<i>- Hello?</i>
- The kid is dead.

1112
01:28:27.747 --> 01:28:29.208
<i>What?</i>

1113
01:28:29.976 --> 01:28:31.893
The old auto shop in Wyevale.

1114
01:28:31.918 --> 01:28:36.044
<i>OK, slow down. Who's
dead? What's going on?</i>

1115
01:28:37.216 --> 01:28:41.342
The kid, Jake. He's dead.

1116
01:28:41.367 --> 01:28:43.636
<i>We're gonna dispatch a
unit to that location.</i>

1117
01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:45.327
<i>Who is this?</i>

1118
01:30:29.627 --> 01:30:32.877
