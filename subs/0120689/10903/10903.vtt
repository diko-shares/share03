00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,341
[female voice whispering]
<i>Gunmar...</i>

2
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,469
<i>Gunmar the Black.</i>

3
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,638
[voice echoing]

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,352
<i>Gunmar the Vicious.</i>

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>Gunmar the Skullcrusher.</i>

6
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>Gunmar!</i>

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,863
[screaming]

8
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,240
[groans]

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,199
Ow!

10
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,327
[groans, sighs]

11
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,330
[students applauding, cheering]

12
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,042
-Give me an A!
-[students] A!

13
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,169
-Give me an R!
-R!

14
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,463
-Give me a C!
-C!

15
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,675
This is taking way too long.
Give me an "adia"!

16
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,759
[confused chatter]

17
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,261
What's that spell?

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,099
[scoffs]
Arcadia!

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,684
[students cheering]

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,645
Go Moles! Go, Moles.

21
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,647
Before we begin,
I have a few announcements.

22
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,734
And his eye is glowing. And then,
the dream just keeps reminding me

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,819
that I'm completely way out of my league.

24
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,196
Right? Tobes.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,366
Who is that masked mole?
You ever wonder?

26
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,703
You didn't hear a word I said
just then, did you?

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,913
Sure, I did. You had no problems
sneaking into the Darklands

28
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,165
when it was to save Claire's brother,

29
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,167
but now that Kanjigar says
you've got to face Gunmar,

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,793
you're having nightmares about him
and are freaking out

31
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,295
that you're way out of your league.

32
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,172
I can multi-task, Jimbo.

33
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,424
[Jim]
It's Bill Aronstein.

34
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,177
Bill moved to Wisconsin.
This is someone else's artistry.

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,971
Someone with feminine wiles.

36
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,100
What? What feminine wiles? How do you
even know that it's a girl under there?

37
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,772
Uh, trust me, dude. I know women,
and that is all woman under there.

38
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,448
[groans]
Hey! All right, mole, that's enough!

39
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,617
Go back into your burrow or whatever!

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,079
Okay. Principal Levit has
taken ill with the flu.

41
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,581
He's asked me to handle
announcing the students

42
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:49,086
the faculty's nominated for the year-end
Spring Fling King and Queen.

43
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,424
The nominees are: Shannon Longhannon!
I'll pronounce it soon, Shannon.

44
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,551
-It's gonna be you.
-No, it's not.

45
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,846
-It is every year.
-And, every year, I don't care.

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,309
-[Lawrence] Darci Scott!
-Wait, what? Really? Yeah!

47
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,728
[Lawrence]
The third and final nominee is...

48
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,188
Mary Wang!

49
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,024
Me? Not you?
[laughs, cheers]

50
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,278
-You? I mean, that's so awesome.
-[Lawrence] And now, for the boys...

51
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:20,033
-Steve Palchuck!
-That's right, plebes! Obvious!

52
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,161
I know, yeah. Get over here, Steve.
Eli Pepperjack!

53
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,746
-[students boo]
-[Lawrence] Hey, no booing!

54
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,373
I have friends!

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,041
You're worrying too much about Gunmar.

56
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,795
Relax, dude. Now that the play's over,
you can focus on your training full time.

57
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,965
Learn some cool new moves,
master some deadly arts.

58
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,926
And finally, Jim Lake Junior!

59
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,637
-[gasps] That's you! [laughs]
-What?

60
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,641
-Really? Buttsnack?
-Time for some friendly competition!

61
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,478
Eat snack, Pepperjack!
[cackling]

62
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,983
Our nominees will compete in a series
of challenges to win your vote.

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,153
Each nominee will propose
a theme for the dance.

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,906
I like disco! I've got to boogie!
That is all.

65
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,452
-How am I gonna find time to--?
-That's not what's important, Jimbo!

66
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,163
Here's what is: You've got a chance
to be king of the school!

67
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,914
You know what that means?
[gasps]

68
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,668
That would make me duke.
Jim Lake for Spring King!

69
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,421
[male voice]
<i>You have defeated the son</i>

70
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,757
<i>but not the father.</i>

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,093
[female voice]
<i>Gunmar is death.</i>

72
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,804
[grunting]

73
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,723
[Kanjigar] <i>Blinkous and my son</i>
<i>have trained you well</i>

74
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,808
<i>in the art of single combat,</i>

75
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:31,605
<i>but rarely will your enemies</i>
<i>do the courtesy of striking one at a time.</i>

76
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,441
-[sighs] All right, enough!
-[female voice] <i>So, you yield?</i>

77
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:39,112
Yes, yeah, I yield. This stopped
being fun for me a little while ago.

78
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,490
[Kanjigar]
<i>You must be prepared to face Gunmar.</i>

79
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,783
Well...

80
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,911
I think you guys just made
your point that I'm not.

81
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,331
I'm not strong enough to kill Gunmar,
even with my friends.

82
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,667
<i>We needed to be hard on you</i>
<i>because you weren't gonna listen to us.</i>

83
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,461
<i>You had to see for yourself.</i>

84
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,215
[female voice]
<i>Besides, there's no way to kill Gunmar.</i>

85
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,925
[male voice]
<i>He's invincible.</i>

86
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,094
-[male voice 2] <i>No, he's not!</i>
-[male voice] <i>So far as we know.</i>

87
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,472
-[female voice] <i>What do you know?</i>
-What do they mean?

88
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:11,186
<i>That sword of yours has fought him</i>
<i>many times, but has never killed him.</i>

89
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>Your weapon and armor were crafted</i>

90

92
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,533
<i>and lose your life in the process.</i>

93
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,208
Jim, did you see my father?

94
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,585
I did.

95
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,799
Did he speak of me?

96
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,301
Yeah. He wished
the Soothscryer could let you in,

97
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,637
but, you know, the rules are the rules.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,139
[sighs]
It's all right, Trollhunter.

99
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,350
You don't have to lie
to protect my feelings.

100
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:56,022
He said we can't kill Gunmar. I would only
be leading my friends to their death.

101
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:00,485
Too bad. I was looking forward
to proving him wrong.

102
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,196
[chuckles]
So was I.

103
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,198
-Aaarrrgghh, what's wrong?
-Blinky.

104
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,576
But if I consult Gringold's Grimore,

105
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,619
cross-reference it
with Axle's Forbidden Almanac--

106
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,122
Of course, it's there! It's true!
[laughing]

107
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,916
-How long's he been like this?
-Long time.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,836
-Maybe you should switch to decaf.
-According to legend,

109
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,799
only one scholar, the Dishonorable Bodus,
uncovered a method of wounding Gunmar.

110
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,386
The Trollhunters just told me
there wasn't any way. How do you do it?

111
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,264
No one knows.
Gunmar had Bodus and his students

112
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,100
hunted down and dispatched
in a most unpleasant manner.

113
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,645
But here, this book,
<i>The Final Testament of Bodus--</i>

114
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:41,192
This is the last surviving copy
of his work! This is the key!

115
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,612
And I'm going to burn it.

116
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,031
-[all gasp]
-Long time.

117
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,911
Blinky, no! What are you doing?
That book might tell us the--

118
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,789
Bodus was being hunted!
He knew he had to keep it secret!

119
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,292
-Oh, no! [grunts]
-[blowing]

120
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,838
-Burn, baby, burn!
-No, don't!

121
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,758
Did Blinky just destroy
our only chance at getting Gunmar?

122
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,260
-Or my baby brother!
-You don't understand.

123
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,889
Bodus hid the secret
<i>within</i> the book. Watch.

124
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,977
[Claire]
It's a message.

125
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,312
Aha!

126
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,898
-I am so glad that worked.
-What does it say?

127
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,026
"In darkest tide,
when Daylight darest wane,

128
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,237
the Myrddin Wylt obscured
a Shadow's bane."

129
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,573
-What's a "Myrddin Wench"?
-It's an ancient name for Merlin.

130
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,784
Shouldn't someone be taking
a picture of this or something?

131
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,994
"Three forces elemental thou must seek.

132
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,331
In marshland, caverns deep,
and mountain's peak.

133
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,376
Where worthy perish,
ye will prevail in night

134
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,420
and eclipse all who quarry
with thy might."

135
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,923
Anyone else freaked out a little bit
by this evil perish poem?

136
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:50,178
No. It said we can prevail!
We can win! He hid a Shadow's bane.

137
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,554
Gunmar's bane?

138
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,974
It's referencing
a weapon of insurmountable power,

139
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,102
formed by three forces unhallowed...

140
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,813
Of course!
It must be the Triumbric Stones!

141
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,483
Three shards of legend tied
to Gunmar's lifeblood, lost to the ages.

142
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,778
-If we seek out these stones--
-We can kill Gunmar!

143
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,614
Blinky, you madman, you did it!

144
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,952
We make the weapon and wham!
Gunmar is done-mar!

145
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,995
Caution.

146
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,789
Indeed! The Triumbric Stones
have been hidden for centuries,

147
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,584
but if I can decipher this text,
Master Jim, then you shall--

148
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,878
"Eclipse all who quarry with thy might."

149
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,050

152
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,265
[sighs]

153
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,310
This is what the world
has become, Angor Rot.

154
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,021
This village...

155
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,233
-It's called "Arcadia Oaks."
-It's on fire?

156
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,070
No. Those are called lights.
Something known as electricity.

157
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,115
You'll come to enjoy it,
along with indoor plumbing.

158
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,827
So many advances since you've been away.

159
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,041
The bridge to Gunmar
is under this... Arcadia?

160
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,295
The bridge will be spoken of no longer.
Gunmar had his chance to rule.

161
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,965
-Now, it's my turn.
-Your turn for what?

162
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,135
Revenge and insurance.

163
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,678

[snarling]

165
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,893
In this town, there is a boy
and this boy fancies a girl,

166
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,979
a girl whose brother
is being held in the Darklands.

167
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,066
If the boy saves the child
from the changeling nursery,

168
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,401
he'll want to save them all.

169
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,237
And it's my job to watch
over my half-breed brethren

170
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,031
and not let that happen.

171
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,993
But how could a fleshbag
even contemplate such a feat?

172
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,998
This boy is the Trollhunter.
It's a long story.

173
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,211
The moral of which
is not to underestimate him.

174
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,880
He already managed to kill
the son of Gunmar.

175
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,049
Obviously, I could deal with him myself,

176
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,969
but a man of my esteemed stature
in this community can't do anything

177
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,846
without arousing unwanted suspicion.

178
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,767
You're afraid of a fleshbag child.

179
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,602
I am not. I merely--

180
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:07,899
He bested Bular and you are afraid.

181
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:13,196
That is why you require Angor Rot.

182
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,577
Just remember who's in charge here.
I bear the ring. You answer to me.

183
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,705
When the boy is finished,
you will have your freedom.

184
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,460
A human Trollhunter...
I've never hunted such game.

185
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:32,549
I will kill this boy,
but I will do it on my own terms.

186
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,095
[goblin laughing]

187
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm back, Arcadia,
and I brought you a gift.

188
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,561
[baby crying]

189
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
Mom, could you--?

190
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,566
[Claire's mom] Claire, could you change
your baby brother's diaper, please?

191
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,986
[to herself]
He's not a baby and he's not my brother.

192
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,196
[crying]

193
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,660
Finally, the help shows up.

194
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,746
If you think for a second
I'm changing your diaper--

195
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,459
Please, I'm more than capable
of using the loo like a civilized troll.

196
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:12,881
I need you to pick me up
a nice, thick, greasy cheeseburger,

197
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,300
with a side of jo-jo potatoes.

198
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,469
What do I look like? Your servant?

199
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,470
[clears throat]

200
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,264
[cries loudly]

201
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,392
All right, enough!
You're a monster. You know that?

202
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,437
Uh, not monster. Changeling.

203
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,900
This isn't fair.

204
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,737
It's no day at the beach
for me either, love bug.

205
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,283
I can't believe I have to pretend
you're my brother. It's... It's cruel.

206
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,786
What's this?
Don't... Don't do that, seriously.

207
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,749
Please don't cry. Forget the jo-jos.
Just a plain burger. [chuckles]

208
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,417
Enrique...

209
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,797
I get it. You miss your brother,
but I assure you, he's perfectly fine.

210
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,384
He's trapped in the Darklands.
How can that be fine?

211
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,678
I'll show ya.

212
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,682
[gathering spit, mumbling]

213
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,937
Your brother is what's known
as my familiar.

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,606
Changelings share
a certain bond with them.

215
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,858
It's good for this little trick.

216
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,071
[gasps, sighs]

217
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,906
Enrique...

218
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,158
<i>Mi hermanito.</i>

219
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,582
I suppose this arrangement
has been rather hard on you.

220
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm going to get you back. I'm going
to find you and I'll bring you home.

221
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,966
[muttering]

222
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,719
Sorry. It's "for a limited time only"
kinda situation.

223
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,930
You don't have to leave.

224
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,977
-How do you like your burger?
-Yum!

225
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,395
[doorbell rings]

226
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,773
Ah, Mr. Strickler.
[sneezes]

227
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,109
-You're back?
-Gesundheit, Principal Levit.

228
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:01,155
My apologies if my absence caused you
any turmoil, but I brought you a gift.

229
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,532
Oh, come in.

230
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,660
-What is it? Some sort of rock?
-Of a sort.

231
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,872
I hear Coach Lawrence was having
a tizzy of a time teaching my class.

232
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,001
<i>Your</i> class? Look, you can't
just drop off the face of the Earth

233
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,252
and expect your job back.

234
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,964
Actually, it's not my job I'm here for.

235
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,090
What is this?

236
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,759
[screaming]

237
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,594
[grunting]

238
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,930
And now, for my next trick...

239
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,640
the vanishing sock!

240
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,145
Mm! Tasty trick.

241
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,732
It's not supposed to be tasty, Aaarrrgghh.
It's supposed to be magic.

242
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,111
[both continue speaking indistinctly]

243
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,113
[engine running]

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,461
-Hey, Mom. I'm home.
-Where have you been?

245
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,213
Just studying at the library
with Claire and Tobes.

246
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,508
The library closed three hours ago.
Where have you been?

247
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,761
I don't know, Mom.
We took the long way home.

248
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,347
I have been worried sick, and that's
the best lie you can come up with?

249
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,810
Okay, sorry! Call off the search parties!

250
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,063
I'm obviously home!

251
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,856
[door opens, slams closed]

252
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,840
Hmm...

253
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,515
-[woman speaking indistinctly]
-[school bell rings]

254
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,059
Jim, this is what you're wearing?

255
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,270
I wear this every day, Tobes.
What else would I be wearing?

256
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,688
Your costume!

257
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,190
[takes deep breath]

258
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,235
In a few minutes, you're selling everyone
your theme for the school dance.

259
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,779
Tobes, look, I'd love to be Spring King.
Who wouldn't?

260
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:09,450
But I'm just a little preoccupied
right now with not getting killed.

261
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,577
There are fates worse than death, Jimbo.

262
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,204
[yelps]

263
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,580
In high school, anyway.

264
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,876
This is our chance to get the school
to finally recognize how cool we are.

265
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,711
-"We"?
-If you become Spring King,

266
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,922
it'll open up a whole
new bracket of women.

267
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,383
I'm talking cheerleaders,
senior cheerleaders--

268
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,303
[gasps] Dare I dream?
Community college dropouts.

269
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,555
[giggles, grunts]

270
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,933
If you don't want to do it for us,
Jimbo, do it for me.

271
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,185
I've always felt
like I was destined to be a duke.

272
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,690
Fine. I'll try to throw
some kind of costume together, okay?

273
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,775
Thank you. And put some effort into it.

274
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,842
Ugh! The things I do for Toby.
Where am I supposed to find a costume?

275
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,928
And what am I supposed to be?
Stapler-man?

276
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,013
Huh?

277
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,307
What is that?

278
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,729
[Lawrence over PA]
<i>Attention, teachers and students!</i>

279
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,856

280
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,567
<i>-One fifty-nine, fifty-eight. Move it!</i>
-Huh.

281
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,492
Huh.

282
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,163
[rumbling]

283
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,215
And now, for the boys, Steve Palchuck!

284
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,219
Arcadia Oaks High,
I have two words for you.

285
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,765
[chanting]
Luau! Luau! Luau!

286
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,560
[students chanting]
Luau! Luau! Luau!

287
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,606
Yeah! Pineapples! Leis! Coconuts?

288
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,608
Thanks, Palchuck.

289
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,859
Hey, Toby, where's Jim?

290
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,487
Oh, he's just throwing together
a last-minute costume and theme.

291
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,155
-No big deal.
-What is he thinking?

292
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,365
These things take time.

293
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,825
You don't just win Spring Fling
by throwing something together.

294
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,954
-Why do I care about this so much?
-Because it matters, Claire!

295
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,790
This is the kind of event
that can propel us through high school

296
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,251
and send us off to college as winners!

297

[suspenseful music playing]

298
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,592
Um, hi. I know that we just met,
but what are you?

[grunts, screams]

300
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,807
Okay. All right, I get it.

-Huh?

Let's take a blast to the past!

00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,463
Back to ancient times!

Boo! Go back to the luau guy!

313
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,268
Okay, if you're gonna play dirty--

[grunting, yelling]

323
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,502
I resurrected you to kill the Trollhunter,
not outsource the job to a golem.

324
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:54,592
He bested the son of Gunmar. Human or not,
this hunter is not to be trifled with.

325
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,886
The hunt is a game,

326
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,183
and when I'm prepared to strike,
he will know.

327
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,228
Mr. Lake? Anybody seen Mr. Lake?
Well, I guess you forfeit--

328
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,605
-Hey, there!
-Jim will be here.

329
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,317

00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,825
[screams]

337
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,285
[pants, sighs]

00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,499
[sighs]
Whew!

340
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,509
Hmm...

341
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,392
[Lawrence over PA]
<i>James Lake? Lake, are you here?</i>

342
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,311
Oh, no! The costume!
[yelps]

343
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,439
-Okay, this is gonna work.
-[boy] Boo!

344
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,358
-Boo!
-[gasps] Oh, my gosh! It worked!

345
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,278
-Wait, where'd the sock go?
<i>-♪ Oh, say, can you see? ♪</i>

346
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,363
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of my act.

347
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,283
<i>-♪ By the dawn's ear-- ♪</i>
-Give me the-- All right, enough!

348
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,701
Jim Lake is disquali--

349
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,537
-[students gasp]
-[gasps] What the heck is that?

350
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,372
[students murmuring]

351
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,082
What's going on here?

352
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,710
Looks like you've been
digging in the dirt, Lake.

353
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,839
-What the heck are you supposed to be?
-He looks like a mole!

354
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,466
[both]
Huh?

355
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,554
-[chanting] Mole! Mole! Mole!
-No, no, no! I'm not a mole! I'm just--

356
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,764
[chanting continues]

357
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,224
Jim Lake Junior...

358
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,101
here to present his theme...

359
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,853
Mole Mania!

360
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,521
[students cheering]

361
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,111
Mole Mania is not even a theme!

362
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,740
The people have spoken.
Jim is the winner!

363
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:27,745
Oh, apparently, Claire's the queen.
But, yes, Jim wins the challenge!

364
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:32,917
Mole Mania is the theme, but if I see
one drop of mud on my gymnasium floor--

365
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,169
Just dress like normal!

366
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:39,048
At any rate-- [clears throat]
there has been a sudden departure.

367
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:44,011
I have heard word that Principal Levit
has taken an indefinite leave of absence.

368
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:49,058
We wish him well. But he sent an e-mail
recommending an interim replacement,

369
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,768
which we all support.

370
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,979
Please welcome Principal Strickler!

371
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,107
-[clapping]
-[Eli] Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

372
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,984
[students murmuring]

373
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,320
What is he doing here?

374
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,072
I thought you said he would be a fool
to ever come back.

375
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,744
I'm very glad to be back
and excited to get started.

376
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:15,209
But let it be known, with me in charge,
things are going to change.
