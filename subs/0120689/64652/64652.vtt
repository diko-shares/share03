1
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,575
- Boone?
- Yes, General?

2
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,953
I'm going into the next office.

3
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,746
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,310
Damn it!

5
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,113
My name is Bob Wilton.
I'm a journalist.

6
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,824
Part of my job is finding
where the story begins.

7
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:46,118
If you were looking at my story,
you might think it began

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,121
when I got a job at the
Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.

9
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,247
Or you might think it began...

10
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,125
...when I married
my college sweetheart Debora.

11
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,543
But you'd be wrong.

12
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,629
Because the real story of my life
began a few years back,

13
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,673
when my editor sent me
to interview a local guy,

14
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,842
he'd heard on the talk radio show.

15
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,803
The guy claimed to have
some kind of psychic powers.

16
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,973
That he could travel with just his mind
anywhere he wanted.

17
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:09,891
He called it "Remote Viewing".

18
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:12,769
The man's name was Gus Lacey.

19
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:14,354
What have you seen lately?

20
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:18,942
Lately, I've been watching
the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.

21
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:22,237
Thanks, Mom.
Uh, and it turns...

22
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,406
I got it. I got it.
Mom, I got it.

23
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:25,532
Thank you.

24
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,575
It turns out...

25
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,287
It's the ghost of a dinosaur.

26
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:33,373
Okay. Wow.

27
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:37,168
So, when did this all
start for you, Gus?

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,504
It started when I was a kid.

29
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,172
Gus told me that
back in the eighties,

30
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:44,467
he was part of a top-secret unit
that got their training in the army.

31
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,762
In a program sanctioned
by the highest levels of government.

32
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:50,890
When I asked him what's the purpose
of this unit was, he said:

33
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:55,478
We were Psychic Spies, mainly.
That was our initial tasking.

34
00:02:55,895 --> 00:02:58,731
Once they realized
what they were sitting on...

35
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:02,151
We were trained to kill animals.

36
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:06,030
- What? With...
- With our minds. That is correct.

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,282
Just by staring at them.

38
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,743
What kind of animals?

39
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:14,580
One of our unit's
stopped the heart of a goat.

40
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:19,084
Power... they unleashed in us.

41
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:24,131
Last week I killed my hamster.

42
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,592
You wanna see?

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,721
There! Look!

44
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,849
You ever seen a hamster
do that before?

45
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:37,435
- I've never owned a hamster, Gus, so...
- Just look! Look!

46
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,938
See the way it's glaring
at its wheel.

47
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,482
Yeah, I guess our hamster-owning
readers will know what's...

48
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:45,652
aberrant behavior and what...
what's...

49
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,614
- Oh, shit! Shit! He's down!
- Yeah, he's down.

50
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:53,284
At this point I'd been staring at him
for about three hours.

51
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,954
Bizarre, right?

52
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:57,789
What is that?

53
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,749
It didn't die.
You said, you killed it?

54
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,958
Yeah, well...

55
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:02,710
Mom said no.

56
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,420
She said:
"Don't show the hamster dying"

57
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:07,757
"Show the tape where
the hamster acts bizarre instead. "

58
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,884
You should have seen
the Skipper at work.

59
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:12,303
- Who's the Skipper?
- Lyn Cassady.

60
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,432
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

61
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,435
He was like an occultic force.

62
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,898
I think he runs a dance studio now.

63
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,653
The little man inside me
dismissed Lacey as a nut.

64
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,280
You know, the little man.

65
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:34,408
He's the one who says:
"Keep your head down. "

66
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,452
"Stay in your little town,
your little job. "

67
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,997
"You're a lucky guy,
your wife loves you. "

68
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,332
"You have everything you want. "

69
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,168
"You're not looking for
some great adventure. "

70
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,130
"But then, one day...

71
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,757
...when you least expect it,

72
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,553
"The great adventure finds you!"

73
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:58,014
Ron's sudden death
was the catalyst for everything.

74
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,351
Deborah told me later that
it had been like a wake-up call for her.

75
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,270
What people used to call:
"The memento mori".

76
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,190
Ron's massive coronary
had reminded her that

77
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:11,027
...life was just too short to
waste any chance of true happiness.

78
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,364
And his death that helped her
to put everything in perspective.

79
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,251
A week after the funeral...

80
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,628
...she left me for my editor.

81
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,339
It seemed like such a tragedy
at the time.

82
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:34,008
We couldn't see beyond
our little lives...

83
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:37,720
...to the great events of history
unfolding out there in the world.

84
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:42,349
I was like a child or a Hobbit,
safe in the Shire.

85
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,353
Or a blond farm boy
in a distant, desert planet,

86
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:49,314
...unaware that he was already
taking the first steps on the path...

87
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,359
...that would lead him relentlessly
towards the heart of a conflict...

88
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,237
...between the forces of
Good and Evil.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,155
Americans are a resolute people,

90
00:05:57,322 --> 00:06:00,450
...who have risen
to every test of our time.

91
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:04,162
Adversity has revealed
the character of our country,

92
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:05,247
...to the world.

93
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:07,874
Had I known where that path
would lead,

94
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:12,003
...had a soft wind from my future
brought me the name of Bill Django,

95
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,797
...I might never have gone.

96
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:15,382
But as it was,

97
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,967
I did what so many men
have done throughout history

98
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,512
...when a woman has broken
their heart...

99
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,972
I went to war.

100
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:05,030
- So, have you seen any combat?
- Yeah, no it's, uh...

101
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:07,950
Well, I won't lie to you Debora,
it's been pretty damn hairy.

102
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,869
Yeah. We've been
watching it on Fox.

103
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,912
Yeah, it's not, uh...

104
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:18,752
I've seen things that
you shouldn't, you know...

105
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,921
Well, I don't even know
why you're there.

106
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:25,050
Well, I think it's important,
people get an accurate picture of what's

107
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:27,094
- What?
- Ready to go?

108
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,471
- what's happening, so...
- Yeah.

109
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:33,350
- So, what is that... is that Dave?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,227
He says "Hi. "

111
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:37,938
Oh, that's, huh...

112
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,273
Is he gonna get his stuff
out of here?

113
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,776
That's...

114
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,530
I... I gotta go.

115
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,908
We're moving out, riding up
north to cover the fighting there

116
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:51,659
Wait, Bob, I'm just...

117
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:57,749
So, what's a useful phrase?

118
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:01,127
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

119
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:04,255
- La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.
- Right.

120
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:08,009
- What's that mean?
- Don't shoot. I'm a reporter.

121
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:11,804
Okay, that I'll mind.

122
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:17,768
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

123
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:21,772
I've been waiting for months for
permission to cross the border into Iraq.

124
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:24,275
All that time, I'd seen
the embedded war correspondents

125
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:26,735
...coming back,
swapping stories.

126
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,696
They all ignored me.

127
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,531
I had to get into Iraq somehow.

128
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,242
Or I would never again
be able to face myself.

129
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:37,204
My wife, or that
one-armed fuckhead Dave.

130
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:41,333
DeWitt Resources, uh,
out of Arkansas.

131
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,919
That's right.
We make trash cans.

132
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:47,714
You're here for the conference, right?
Looking for a contract?

133
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:50,217
- I guess.
- What's your pitch?

134
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,428
Well... we're real cheap.

135
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,808
- Bob Wilton.
- Skip.

136
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:01,436
- Do you mind if I...?
- No.

137
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:06,191
- So you're from Arkansas?
- No.

138
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,861
- Been here long?
- No.

139
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,117
Be careful what you wish for.

140
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,411
I wanted to prove myself.

141
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,788
And for my sins...

142
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,624
Faith taught me a lesson.

143
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,130
Lyn Cassady?

144
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,965
Lyn Cassady.

145
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,010
For me, after Bill he was the
most gifted psych I've ever met.

146
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,976
Do you know a Gus Lacey?

147
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,731
Skip?

148
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,156
Hello?

149
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,327
Lyn?
I've your hat.

150
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,253
Skip?

151
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,883
- You work for Hooper?
- Hooper? No.

152
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,052
I work for the Ann
Arbor Daily Telegram.

153
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,928
How do you know about Lacey?

154
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,973
I interviewed him a few months ago
for my paper.

155
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,687
Prick.

156
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,023
Follow me.

157
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,776
Let me ask you something.

158
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,863
What color were the chairs
in the hotel bar?

159
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,744
You were in there for hours.
What color were the chairs?

160
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,163
- Green.
- Beige.

161
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,207
How many lights are there
in this room?

162
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,585
A Super Soldier wouldn't have to look.
He would just know.

163
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,463
- A Super Soldier?
- A Jedi Warrior.

164
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,631
He would know
where all the lights were.

165
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,258
He could walk through a room
and he could tell you...

166
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
...how many power outlets
there were.

167
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,595
People are walking around
with their eyes closed.

168
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:06,558
At Level One, we were trained to
instantly absorb all details.

169
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,646
- What's, uh, what's a Jedi Warrior?
- You're looking at one.

170
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,274
- You're a Jedi Warrior?
- That's correct.

171
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:15,984
I don't...

172
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,736
I don't know what that means.

173
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,782
I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady,
Special Forces, retired.

174
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,825
In the eighties,
I was trained at Fort Bragg

175
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:27,537
...under a secret initiative
codenamed "Project Jedi. "

176
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,583
The objective of the project
was to create Super Soldiers.

177
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,376
Soldiers with super powers.

178
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,588
We were the first generation
of the New Earth Army.

179
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,008
- You’ve got super powers?
- That's correct.

180
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:41,759
Wait a minute.

181
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,221
What you saying is that you...

182
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,807
...were a Psychic Spy, like Lacey?

183
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,810
We prefer the term "Remote Viewer. "

184
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:54,772
- How does that work?
- Well, every Jedi had different techniques.

185
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:59,277
Mel Landau used to visualize packing
all his troubles into a little suitcase,

186
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,486
...to clear his mind.

187
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:04,490
Steve Cuttle recite Bible verse
which was...

188
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,158
What about you?

189
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,078
I find... I find drinking helps.
And...

190
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,455
And if I'm listening to
classic rock...

191
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,751
- Oh, yeah? Like who?
- I like Boston. Boston usually works.

192
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,921
What other powers did you practice?

193
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,423
Invisibility.

194
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:24,510
- Invisibility?
- Yeah. That was Level Three.

195
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:29,389
- Like... actual invisibility?
- Well, yeah, that was the goal.

196
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,768
Eventually, we adapted it to just
finding a way of not being seen.

197
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,811
But once you understand,

198
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:39,316
the linkage between observation
and reality,

199
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:42,652
...then you begin to
dance with invisibility.

200
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:44,613
Like camouflage?

201
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:47,741
No. It's not like camouflage.

202
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:50,285
We also practiced Phasing.

203
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:53,621
Crossing from particle to wave,
from the physical to energy.

204
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,624
Solid objects seem to pass
right through you.

205
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,960
That starts with a breathing exercise.

206
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:04,590
Then you think black.
That's the nothingness. Got it?

207
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,847
I don't know what the...

208
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:13,599
Can I be honest with you, Lyn?

209
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,767
I don't know what to make of this.

210
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,645
I don't know what to say.
This is amazing stuff.

211
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,522
I wanna...

212
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,692
- Could I write a story about this?
- Not gonna happen.

213
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,402
Because, I've been looking
for a story, Lyn.

214
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,279
And I was gonna write
about the re-build contracts...

215
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:28,781
...but this is much better.
This is much better.

216
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:31,242
- Not gonna happen.
- All I'm saying is we could meet tomorrow

217
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,993
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

218
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,245
- What? You're going home?
- Going to Iraq.

219
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:38,248
I've been thinking about partnering
with a factory in Al Qaim.

220
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,920
- I could come.
- What?

221
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,047
- I could come, maybe...
- Look, I don't want to be a story.

222
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,341
- I don't need the attention.
- Look, we could change names, stuff...

223
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,801
Look! There's a war over there, Bob!
Do you understand that?

224
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:50,886
War!

225
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,554
Now, I don't have to be
looking out for you.

226
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:56,016
You... you wouldn't have...
I'll look after myself.

227
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:58,477
I've been in some pretty hairy situations.

228
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,562
I'm a journalist, Lyn.
You understand?

229
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,189
A journalist.
I go where the story is.

230
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,034
What is this?

231
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:18,454
Nothing. I was just doodling.

232
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,792
What's the matter?

233
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,585
Nothing.

234
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,605
The U.S Army doesn't really have
any serious alternative...

235
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:46,690
...than to be wonderful!

236
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,193
This does not represent
the official position...

237
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:52,071
...of the United States Army
at this time.

238
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,491
Bill Django.

239
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:57,826
Who's Bill Django?

240
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,495
The man who wrote that book.

241
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:04,124
He said it all started when he
fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.

242
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:06,501
Move out!
Go! Go! Go!

243
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:08,962
Go! Go!

244
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,047
Move!
Move it! Move it!

245
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,573
Fuck you motherfucker!

246
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:39,367
- Hey, knock it off!
- Hold your fire!

247
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,078
Chris! Knock it off!

248
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,413
Will you knock it off?

249
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:46,290
Jesus!

250
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,963
- Medic!
- You'll be alright.

251
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:55,341
Alright!

252
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,385
What are you waiting for?

253
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:01,180
What the fuck!
Why isn't anyone firing?

254
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,015
Fire!

255
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:09,021
Every single one of Bill's men
fired high.

256
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:12,232
They instinctively hadn't wanted
to shoot another person.

257
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,943
Later Bill would come across a study,
which revealed that...

258
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:18,864
...only 15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill.

259
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:22,159
The rest aimed high,
didn't fire at all,

260
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,995
...or pretended to be
busy doing something else.

261
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:34,129
I got you, sir.
Stay with me, alright?

262
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,839
I got you.

263
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,841
Hang in there.

264
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,730
Their gentleness...

265
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:54,816
...is their strength.

266
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,156
While recovering in the hospital,

267
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:04,825
Bill wrote to the
Vice Chief of Staff for the Army,

268
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,370
explaining that he wanted to go on
a fact-finding mission...

269
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:10,039
...to explore
alternative combat tactics.

270
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:13,417
The Pentagon agreed to pay
his salary and expenses.

271
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,544
What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon

272
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,547
...was that he was really looking for
the answer to his vision.

273
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,507
How could his men's gentleness,

274
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,760
...their general lack of interest
in killing people,

275
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,803
...be turned into a strength?

276
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:28,056
How could love and peace
help win wars?

277
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,851
Bill knew where to go
to find out.

278
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:14,018
Bill disappeared into the
New Age Movement for six years.

279
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:17,647
Like all Shaman before him,
he had traversed the wilderness.

280
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,983
Now he was returning to his people,
a changed man.

281
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,152
He brought with him his
confidential report

282
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,487
...which he called:

283
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,198
"The New Earth Army manual. "

284
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,330
The New Earth Army is a banner under
which the forces of good can gather.

285
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,040
The courage and nobility
of the Warrior,

286
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,709
...blended with the
spirituality of the Monk.

287
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,587
The Jedi Warrior will follow
in the footsteps...

288
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:43,255
...of the great imagineers
of the past:

289
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:47,384
Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung,
Walt Disney...

290
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,682
The role of The New Earth Army is
to resolve conflict world-wide.

291
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:58,061
Jedi's will parachute into war zones,
utilizing sparkly eyes technique,

292
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,147
...carrying symbolic
flowers and animals,

293
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,858
...playing indigenous music
and words of peace...

294
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,569
What's... What's the
sparkly eyes technique?

295
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:08,738
Are you ready?
Right.

296
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:18,790
- Got it?
- Okay.

297
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,125
- You see it? You got it?
- I think, I got it.

298
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:27,590
As Lyn drove on, I wondered
what the hell I was doing.

299
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,927
I wanted to go back.
This wasn't me, this was crazy.

300
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,720
And so was Lyn.

301
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:36,974
But, by then, it was too late.
We'd already crossed the border.

302
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:44,523
What? Does that direct
your powers?

303
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:45,691
What?

304
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:48,485
The cone. Does it direct your
psychic powers or something?

305
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:49,737
No.

306
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,118
It cooks supper.
It's solar.

307
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:59,246
Utilizing the power of the universe.

308
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,748
No pollution,
totally renewable.

309
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,626
That's New Earth Army technology.

310
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:12,509
Pretty mind blowing, isn't it?

311
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:16,096
First time I saw that,
I was like...

312
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,599
- What the fuck?
- Yeah. But, well it's...

313
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:21,601
But what?

314
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,605
It's just hard to believe
the Pentagon paid for this.

315
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:28,691
There's nothing in here,
actually about fighting?

316
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:31,903
The New Earth Army was
tasked with preventing conflict.

317
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:34,447
We're a force of peace,
not war.

318
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,199
Bill understood
if you want to change the world,

319
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,494
...you've got to start
by changing the armies.

320
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:42,205
He was the guy that started
the research in the non-lethals.

321
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,249
- Non-lethals?
- Check this out.

322
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:50,838
- The Predator.
- The Predator?

323
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:52,757
Lyn, that's just a plastic...

324
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,508
You're mine now.

325
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,802
The predator is 100% biodegradable.

326
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:59,180
It's friendly to the earth
and it can hurt you in a hundred ways.

327
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:00,306
Fuck!

328
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:04,059
It has warrior capacities.
And it looks a little bit funny.

329
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:06,103
Jesus! Stop it!

330
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,771
- I bought it online.
- Fuck!

331
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,565
The funny thing is, you could see
this just lying on the ground...

332
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:12,568
...and you'd never know
that it has such lethality.

333
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:15,529
Eyeballs.

334
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:22,202
Goddammit!

335
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:28,375
Well, I guess it's officially night now.

336
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:32,212
Piece's a shit.

337
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:56,194
I've got Crohn's.
The steroids help.

338
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:02,325
Sometimes there's a need, Bob.

339
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,494
Sometimes people are calling
out for something,

340
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,830
...they don't even know
it themselves.

341
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:14,545
And then a man like Bill
appears out of nowhere,

342
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,132
...because he heard the call.

343
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:25,764
We are a hollow army, gentlemen.

344
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,018
Vietnam has crushed our soul.

345
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:32,020
We have to dream a new America.

346
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:36,441
An America that no longer has an
exploitative view of natural resources.

347
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:40,445
No longer promotes
consumption at all costs.

348
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,533
But to achieve this dream...

349
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:49,246
We must become the first Superpower
to develop super powers.

350
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:52,165
We must create Warrior Monks.

351
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:56,294
Men and women
who can fall in love with everyone,

352
00:23:56,503 --> 00:24:00,173
...sense plant auras,
pass through walls,

353
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:04,677
...stop saying mindless cliches
and see into the future.

354
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:09,724
I want you to
join me in this vision.

355
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:13,644
Be all you can be.

356
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,314
Amongst Bill’s audience that day
was a Brigadier General...

357
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,191
...from the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

358
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:19,984
Dean Hopgood.

359
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,195
For some time, the General
had been concerned with...

360
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:24,864
...Soviet research
into psychic powers.

361
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,532
According to some stories,

362
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:29,827
...the Soviets had designed
"psychotronic generators. "

363
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,831
Machines capable of bombarding
the President with negative energy.

364
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,333
They were also conducting
sadistic experiments...

365
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,086
...to see whether animals
had psychic powers.

366
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:40,004
Could they, for instance,

367
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:43,465
...telepathically detect that their
babies were distressed?

368
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,009
Sick bastards.

369
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,637
But when did the Soviets begin
this type of research?

370
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,139
Well, sir...

371
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,558
It looks like they found out
about our attempt to...

372
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,435
...telepathically communicate with
one of our nuclear subs.

373
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,896
The Nautilus, while it was
under the Polar cap.

374
00:24:57,938 --> 00:24:59,940
- What attempt?
- There was no attempt.

375
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,401
It seems the story
was a French hoax.

376
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,236
But the Russians think
the story about the story...

377
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:07,405
...being a French hoax
is just a story, sir.

378
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:09,157
So, they've started psi research...

379
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,825
...because they thought
we were doing psi research,

380
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,619
when in fact we
weren't doing psi research?

381
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,954
Yes, sir. But now that
they're doing psi research,

382
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,624
...we're gonna have to
do psi research, sir.

383
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:22,253
We can't afford to have the Russians
leading the field in the paranormal.

384
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:26,924
Two weeks later, the Army adopted
the slogan: "Be all you can be. "

385
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:31,304
And appointed Bill, Commander of the
first New Earth Army battalion.

386
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,445
Lyn?

387
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:52,575
Lyn!?

388
00:25:58,372 --> 00:26:01,750
Lyn? Lyn!

389
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:04,128
What?

390
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,218
Nothing, I...

391
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:15,138
- What? What are you doing?
- Salute to the sun.

392
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:19,017
Alright. We're Oscar Mike.

393
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:22,687
- That's "On the Move", soldier.
- Right.

394
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,207
What are you doing?

395
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,877
Cloud bursting.
Keeps me in shape.

396
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,505
- Really? Which one?
- That one.

397
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:53,134
- What? This one?
- No. That one. The big one.

398
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,637
Isn't that too far away?

399
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:58,806
They're all far away.

400
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:08,357
And it's gone.

401
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,373
Jesus, you had like
the whole desert to drive in, Lyn.

402
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:26,291
I'm sorry about that Bob.

403
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,127
Must have got a little
bi-locational there.

404
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,922
Don't worry it though.
Somebody will come along soon.

405
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,263
- Heads.
- Right.

406
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,893
- Head.
- Right.

407
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:51,274
- What's your record at this?
- Two hundred and sixty four. Tails.

408
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:55,862
Right. Well, that's pretty...

409
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,576
Thank you, Jesus.
Good Jesus!

410
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,661
Please! Please!
Please!

411
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:06,164
Can you help us?
Can you help?

412
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:08,541
Can you help?
We drove into a rock.

413
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,835
And I wonder, if you could
take us to some...

414
00:28:10,877 --> 00:28:13,004
...like a town or someplace?

415
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,424
Can we... we get in?
Thank you.

416
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,592
He says fattore.
Fattore, he says.

417
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,678
We can get in.
Come on.

418
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,353
Thank you. Thank you for, uh,
picking us up.

419
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:31,897
No car's came by.

420
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,483
How... How far is...

421
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,572
Lyn?

422
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:44,284
- Is this...
- Yeah.

423
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,832
We're gonna die.

424
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:55,045
We're gonna be killed by Al Qaeda.

425
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,968
- I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
- What the hell do you know?

426
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,636
You don't know.

427
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:06,389
You don't know!
You don't know anything!

428
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:08,558
This is all your fault!

429
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,897
Bob, there's something
I have to tell you.

430
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:18,192
When I said that I was retired
from the unit, that was a lie.

431
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:19,736
I'm on a mission.

432
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:22,864
DeWitts was just my cover.
I've been reactivated.

433
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:25,825
I couldn't tell you
because this is a Black Op.

434
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:29,787
But I think you have a role to play.
I think that's why you're here.

435
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,081
You're an idiot.

436
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,750
You know why I'm here?

437
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:39,672
I just wanted to get into Iraq
so I could prove to my wife...

438
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,840
...that I wasn't a...

439
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:45,010
And now I'm gonna die.

440
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:48,430
I'm gonna die.
And she's right. I'm such a...

441
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,015
...fuckhead!

442
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:52,893
Bob, have you ever heard of
"Optimum Trajectory"?

443
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,312
What?

444
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,523
"Optimum trajectory. "

445
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,528
Your life is like a river.

446
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,572
That you're aiming for a goal
that isn't your destiny,

447
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,908
...you'll always gonna be swimming
against the current.

448
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,202
Young Gandhi wants to be
a stock-car racer?

449
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,536
It's not gonna happen.

450
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,288
Little Anne Frank wants to
be a High School teacher.

451
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,457
Tough titty Anne.
That's not your destiny.

452
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:19,836
But you will go on to move
the hearts and minds of millions.

453
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:24,674
Find out what your destiny is
and the river will carry you.

454
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:29,429
Now, sometimes events in life...

455
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:33,099
...give an individual clues
as to where their destiny lies.

456
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:35,893
Like those little doodles
you just happened to draw?

457
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:44,819
It's the Ajna chakra,
the third eye.

458
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:47,029
The symbol of the Jedi.

459
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:50,324
When I saw that
you're drawing it, well...

460
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:53,953
...the Universe gives you clues
like that, you don't ignore it.

461
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,415
You're meant to be here with me, Bob.

462
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,086
It's the Jedi in you
that sensed it.

463
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,881
Now, I don't think these guys
are FRL's or Mahdi Army...

464
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:07,758
...I think we're talking
standard criminals here.

465
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,260
Which means they're gonna try
to sell us to another group.

466
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,846
- We can't let that happen.
- How are we gonna stop them?

467
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:15,307
There's three of them!
And they've got guns!

468
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:16,558
We're Jedi, Bob.

469
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:19,269
We don't fight with guns.
We fight with our minds.

470
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:21,021
What do you mean?

471
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:25,108
Okay, let's say that we have no choice
but to fight with these guys.

472
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:28,987
We will use visual aesthetics
to instill psychically...

473
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,699
...in the enemy
a disincentive to attack.

474
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:35,785
What do you mean?

475
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:38,788
Okay, you pick one of them out,
you lock eyes with him,

476
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:42,041
...and you go into this monotone
and you're gonna go...

477
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,504
"I'm not going to attack you. "

478
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,799
You relax your body and your voice.

479
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:53,886
And you just rip out
one of his eyes.

480
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,180
Or you get a pen
and you stab him in the neck,

481
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,057
you create this...
a fountain of blood,

482
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,851
I mean a real fountain, get it
squirting all over his buddies.

483
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:04,897
That is a psychic disincentive,
right there.

484
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:07,983
We haven't got a pen.

485
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,153
You're missing the point.

486
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:13,614
Come here.
Stand up. Come.

487
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:16,325
Let me show you something.
Alright.

488
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,661
- Choke me.
- I don't want to, Lyn.

489
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:19,953
Choke me.
What am I gonna do?

490
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:21,497
I don't know...
there's too many sharp edges.

491
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:23,957
It's okay.
You can "attack me. "

492
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,126
What's with the quotation fingers?

493
00:32:26,293 --> 00:32:28,837
It's like saying, I'm only capable
of ironic attacking or something.

494
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,464
Choke me!

495
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:34,092
Well, if I choose to choke you,
what are you gonna do?

496
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:36,678
I'm gonna interrupt your
thought pattern.

497
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,653
See? I barely moved.

498
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:56,197
Physics wise,
not much going on here.

499
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,283
It's the psychic energy that's
important. You okay?

500
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,368
- Sharp edges.
- Yeah.

501
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:04,080
- You felt fear though in the beginning?
- Yes.

502
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:07,041
Would you say that level of fear
was abnormal?

503
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,502
I don't know. I was pretty
terrified anyway...

504
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:13,589
...but the fear I felt on the run-up
to the choking was, you know, unusual.

505
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:14,924
You know why?

506
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:17,301
Because it wasn't you.
It was me.

507
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:21,180
I was inside your head.
Fighting with the mind.

508
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:24,809
- Now, you must always...
- Okay. We'll go.

509
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,156
I'm sorry I freaked out
back there, Lyn.

510
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,908
You learned a lesson.

511
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:44,036
"Whatever you fear most
has no power over you,

512
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:46,622
...it's the fear
that has the power. "

513
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:49,458
- Bill?
- Oprah.

514
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:54,045
You really don't work
for DeWitts?

515
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,173
Just my cover.

516
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:58,300
Gus Lacey said
you ran a dance studio.

517
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,051
That was just cover too, right?

518
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:02,971
No. I do run a dance studio.

519
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:05,306
I love dancing.

520
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,685
And you're out here
on a mission, right?

521
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,563
In time, Bob.

522
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:14,857
Did you mean what you said back there
when you said I had some...

523
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:17,068
...I had some Jedi in me?

524
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:20,321
We learn to recognize our own kind.

525
00:34:20,488 --> 00:34:22,281
Haven't you always felt like
you were different?

526
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,616
Yes. Yes, I have.

527
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:25,034
That's the way it is for us.

528
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:27,745
We're the ones who don't fit in,
when we were kids.

529
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,830
Have you always had powers?

530
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:31,207
Kind of.

531
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,584
Foxtrot-117 has launched.
Tracking now.

532
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:36,629
Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667...

533
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:44,011
Did you crash those computers?

534
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:47,932
Yes, sir.

535
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,770
Far fucking out!

536
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:56,565
How would you feel
about a transfer, son?

537
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,985
I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django.

538
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:02,904
If you pass this course...

539
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:06,199
...you'll be a psychic weapon.

540
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:10,537
An angel of death,
our enemies worst nightmare!

541
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:15,250
Until that time, you’re nothing!

542
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,335
Less than nothing!

543
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:21,840
- Do you understand?
- Sir! Yes, sir!

544
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:30,557
I'm just kidding about this shit.

545
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:35,478
Okay, what shall we do now, uh?

546
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,399
Let's dance.

547
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:41,526
Okay.

548
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:44,320
Give it everything you've got.

549
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:45,905
That's it.

550
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:52,036
- What's your first name, Cassady?
- Lyn, sir.

551
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:56,582
You've gotta free your feet
before you can free your mind, Lyn.

552
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:59,043
I'm not really much of a dancer, sir.

553
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,004
That's not true, is it?

554
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,089
You can dance.

555
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:06,884
It's just someone told you not to.

556
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,893
Stop acting so fucking queer!

557
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:22,899
Well, I'm your commanding officer,
and I'm ordering you to...

558
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:25,235
...let the dance out!

559
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:28,864
Come on, dance!
Goddammit!

560
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:32,117
Let it go!

561
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:35,829
Let it go!

562
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:37,706
That's it!

563
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,125
Welcome to the Heroes Journey, Lyn.

564
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:45,672
Okay everyone, remember,
we officially do not exist as a unit.

565
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,509
And remember,
no solid food for the first week.

566
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,937
Belgian waffle, ginseng
and amphetamines.

567
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:04,982
Not to be abused,
but very fucking handy.

568
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:09,153
There's the opening.
Feel the bend now. You feel it?

569
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:11,197
That's it! Yeah!

570
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,205
- Think cold!
- Bravo Zulu! Yeah!

571
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:24,001
Mother Earth, my life support
system as a soldier,

572
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:28,547
I must drink your blue water,
live inside your read clay,

573
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,757
...and eat your green skin.

574
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:34,219
Carry my body through
space and time.

575
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:39,099
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

576
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:44,229
I'm yours and you are mine.
I salute you.

577
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,239
After years of feeling
like an oddball...

578
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,616
...Lyn had finally found a home.

579
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:01,120
At last he was with men who prided
themselves on being different.

580
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,332
Left shoulder, that's it.

581
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,918
These were Golden Days for Lyn.

582
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:10,088
There was something so noble
and pure in Bill's vision...

583
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:13,841
...that the Jedi's felt inspired
to be more than soldiers.

584
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:16,761
In a world torn apart by
greed and hate...

585
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:20,306
they would be a force for good,
for peace.

586
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,143
For the first time in his life
Lyn felt truly happy.

587
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,314
Then into the garden
a serpent did come.

588
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,608
Let me finish this.
Let me finish this.

589
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,986
Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
writer from Colorado,

590
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,405
...recruited to the Jedi
after General Hopgood...

591
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,866
...met him at a
spoon-bending party.

592
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:45,914
Jesus!

593
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:48,083
You did this?

594
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,711
You son of a...!

595
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,546
Right from the start...

596
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:55,590
...he had made himself unpopular
with the rest of the unit.

597
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,762
Congratulations, Scotty. I'm sorry
it doesn't work out between you two.

598
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:06,351
Larry made it quite clear that
he despised most of the other Jedi's.

599
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:08,812
Hey, man! How'd you like it
if somebody did that to you?

600
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,689
But Lyn...
Lyn was different.

601
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:12,857
Fuck off!

602
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,026
He really hated him.

603
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:20,073
K-9. Scotty?

604
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,701
It's...

605
00:39:25,953 --> 00:39:30,458
- It's something cylindrical? It's a pencil?
- Okay. Larry?

606
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:40,009
This is Larry's spirit guide, Maud.

607
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:43,304
I'm looking into the cupboard now.

608
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,681
And I see...

609
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,767
I see...

610
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:51,228
...a tin mug?

611
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:53,939
Lyn?

612
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,534
It's a man sitting on a chair.

613
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,389
No, wait a minute.
You said A, not K!

614
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:32,268
- He said A.
- Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.

615
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:39,525
After a year's training,
Lyn was given his first tasking.

616
00:40:39,817 --> 00:40:43,780
A senior NATO General had been kidnapped
by Red Brigade members in Italy.

617
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:46,365
Bill was unofficially asked
if his unit would be able to...

618
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:49,035
...help find him
before it was too late.

619
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,122
We're north of Verona.

620
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:56,208
It's a small town near a lake.

621
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,462
I can see a cinema.

622
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:03,465
Across the street from the cinema,
there's a shop.

623
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:07,219
Or it's a... it's a cafe.

624
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:10,139
He's in the apartment above the cafe.

625
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,726
The name of the town is...

626
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,020
...it's something sweet.

627
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:19,773
Dolce.

628
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:22,776
The name of the town is Dolce.

629
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:27,030
Bill had never encountered anyone
with such psychic capabilities.

630
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:29,866
And from that moment on,
Lyn's reputation soared.

631
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,454
Rank, medals... these things
mean little to the Jedi.

632
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:39,084
But growth in spirit, in wisdom,
in psychic power,

633
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,128
...these are things
that earn our respect.

634
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:46,549
Native Americans believed that
when one received the Eagle feather,

635
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:50,720
...it was the mark of love,
of gratitude...

636
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,097
...and ultimate respect.

637
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:57,143
Only true human beings
may carry the Eagle feather.

638
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,273
- Way to go, Lyn!
- That's great!

639
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,237
The word soon got out in the
intelligence community...

640
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,031
...that there was a sergeant
at Fort Bragg...

641
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:12,658
...who could find whatever
you needed found.

642
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,869
It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world...

643
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,745
...without leaving his room.

644
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:18,164
As Bill said:

645
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,625
the Force truly was strong
with this one.

646
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,080
Lyn?

647
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,916
Don't worry, Bob.
We're not gonna get in that truck.

648
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,338
You don't want us.

649
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,299
You don't want us!

650
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:19,807
Put your weapon away.

651
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,518
Put your weapon away.

652
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,186
Bob, don't move.

653
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,689
Put your weapon away.
Bob, don't move.

654
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:29,984
Bob, stay put!
Bob, stop!

655
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:38,200
La tutlek. Ana sahaffi.

656
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,879
Hold it right there.

657
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:59,054
Now at the time I thought
Lyn was having some kind of fit here.

658
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,223
Later I discovered
what he was actually doing...

659
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,308
...was performing
the Echmeyer technique.

660
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,938
Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
with sixty-three confirmed kills.

661
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,692
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do.

662
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,820
It's been said he could have
a tug of war with a dozen men...

663
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,655
...and not move an inch.

664
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,575
He was also able to lift bags
of sand on hooks...

665
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,660
...hung through his scrotum.

666
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,165
He was one of the Jedi teachers
at Fort Bragg.

667
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,793
Sir, what is the practical
application of this?

668
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:34,505
Ben caused quite a stir
by advocating his controversial...

669
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,841
..."shock and awe"
knife attack method.

670
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,511
The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary

671
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,140
but criticized by others who believed
that the leaping and spinning...

672
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,268
...might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself.

673
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,148
Lyn Cassady, however,
became a firm convert to the style.

674
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,236
Of course, Lyn didn't actually have
a knife with him at this particular time.

675
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,030
So, I still think that
what he did was kind of...

676
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,365
...reckless.

677
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,410
Throw your hands up!

678
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,500
You idiot.

679
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,379
Shit! Shit!
They are not coming!

680
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:18,673
We're okay. We're okay.
They're not coming! We'll be alright.

681
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,053
Oh, shit!

682
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,642
There he is.

683
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:33,646
Sir, it's okay!
We're Americans.

684
00:45:33,813 --> 00:45:35,231
We're here to help you!

685
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,066
Sir!?

686
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,485
Sir, will you...

687
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,903
Oh, crap!

688
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,282
- What happened? What happened?
- I think I just ran him over.

689
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:45,742
Sir?

690
00:45:47,118 --> 00:45:48,536
Are you alright, sir?

691
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:49,954
Bob, give me a hand.

692
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,081
Come on! Help him up!
Get him up here!

693
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,500
Bring him up!
Bring him up!

694
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:57,837
Shit! Shit!
Who is that?

695
00:46:05,511 --> 00:46:07,096
Don't move!

696
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:11,767
Let's see your hands!
Now!

697
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,738
Todd Nixon,
Army small business office.

698
00:46:26,448 --> 00:46:27,866
Mahmud Daash.

699
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:30,452
Ask me what business I'm in,
Muhammad.

700
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:33,538
Mahmud.
What business are you in, sir?

701
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:36,875
Right now, I'm in the
quality of life business.

702
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:40,837
We've got over 25 million Iraqis out
here who wanna be independent,

703
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:42,714
...wanna make something
for themselves.

704
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,383
More than anything else
they wanna buy stuff.

705
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:47,886
Cell phones, digital cameras,
leisure suits... you name it.

706
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,763
If it sells in Boston,
we can damn well sell it in Baghdad.

707
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:52,098
Am I right, Muhammad?

708
00:46:52,182 --> 00:46:53,016
He knows what I'm talking about.

709
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:56,019
We've got Halliburton, Parsons,
Perini... just in the primes.

710
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,604
We're gonna have McDonald's,
we're gonna have Starbucks...

711
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,858
No corporate tax.
It's gonna be a gold rush.

712
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:05,069
Oh, and by the way, fuck the French!
Did you hear that shit?

713
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:07,530
Chirac wants to bring
French contractors in?

714
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:10,658
Hey, Phil, what's the most common
French expression?

715
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,326
"I give up. "

716
00:47:13,286 --> 00:47:17,498
That's fucking funny.
Year zero, guys. Year zero.

717
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:22,586
Okay, we're in Indian country now.
Check your six.

718
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,967
We've got a line of cars
at the gas station here.

719
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:29,176
You guys wanna wait?

720
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:31,387
Negative.
We're too exposed.

721
00:47:31,512 --> 00:47:34,473
We're taking the station.
Go in fangs out!

722
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:56,953
Secure the perimeter!

723
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,174
- Give her the go-juice, Eddy!
- I filled her up last time.

724
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:13,886
- That's bullshit.
- He did fill her up last time, Gary.

725
00:48:15,054 --> 00:48:17,348
With all due respect, sir,
bull-fucking-shit. I tanked her last time.

726
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,391
- Bullshit!
- Every time!

727
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,060
Can we figure out
some kind of fucking system!?

728
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:24,063
Contact! Contact!
We've got contact!

729
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:26,399
Where is the shooter?

730
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,362
And what became known
as the Battle of Ramadi,

731
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:34,365
twelve people were injured.
Mostly locals.

732
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:36,075
Both security companies claimed...

733
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,953
...they had been fired upon
first by Iraqis.

734
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:40,329
Of course, it was later
revealed that...

735
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:42,790
...they had actually
fired upon each other.

736
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:46,502
One down!

737
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:50,255
My house is not far.
We could walk from here.

738
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:52,716
- Sounds good, Muhammad.
- Mahmud.

739
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:57,429
As we ran for cover,
I thought this was what I wanted.

740
00:48:57,512 --> 00:48:58,263
I was on a mission,

741
00:48:58,347 --> 00:49:00,766
...even if I didn't know
what kind of mission it was.

742
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:03,268
But I could hear
the little man inside me again.

743
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:05,854
He was screaming
like a little girl.

744
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:11,610
Krom One! Krom One!
This is Freedom Frontier.

745
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:12,569
We are under attack.

746
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,654
This is fucking fubar!

747
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:53,275
Muhammad led us
to his home...

748
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,362
...which as it turned out
had been robbed in his absence.

749
00:49:56,445 --> 00:50:00,115
And also, accidentally
shot up in a fire fight.

750
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:03,869
Neighbors told him that
his wife had left,

751
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:06,246
...they weren't sure
where she had gone.

752
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:21,136
I'm very sorry
for running you over, sir.

753
00:50:22,888 --> 00:50:24,890
It was an accident.

754
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:29,394
And I apologize for that
security detachment.

755
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:33,398
I don't want you to think that
all Americans are like that.

756
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:38,444
I apologize for the kidnappers.

757
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:41,072
Not your fault, sir.

758
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:45,243
I mean, we've
kidnappers in America and...

759
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:48,705
There's always... bad apples.

760
00:51:21,236 --> 00:51:24,072
Lyn? Are you awake?

761
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,038
I was just...
thinking about Mahmud.

762
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:35,208
They're just trying to do
something with their lives.

763
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:39,087
Something... lasting, good.

764
00:51:40,088 --> 00:51:42,716
But there's always somebody
who wants to smash it up.

765
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:46,344
What Lyn was really thinking
about was Larry Hooper.

766
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:50,056
And the part he had played in the
destruction of the New Earth Army.

767
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:52,767
But, in fairness,
the Jedi's own eccentricities...

768
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,436
...hadn't exactly won
them many allies.

769
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,814
For example,
there was Tim Kootz,

770
00:51:57,897 --> 00:52:00,191
who, on being asked to ascertain
the whereabouts of...

771
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:03,528
...General Manuel
Noriega, had replied,

772
00:52:05,738 --> 00:52:09,283
- Ask Angela Lansbury.
- Say again, Tim?

773
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:12,161
Ask Angela Lansbury.

774
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:17,958
Excellent. Excellent.

775
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:31,430
We asked Angela Lansbury.

776
00:52:31,513 --> 00:52:32,389
And?

777
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:36,018
She said she didn't know
where General Noriega was.

778
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:47,279
Or there was the time Major
General Gilling was visiting the base.

779
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:49,823
And saw Jedi trainee
Clifford Hickox...

780
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:53,743
...practicing the ancient Sun
Dance of the Sioux Nation.

781
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:56,079
The Jedi's survived
such minor scandals,

782
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,540
...protected, it was rumored,
by President Reagan.

783
00:52:58,707 --> 00:53:00,542
Who was a fan of both
the Star Wars films...

784
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:02,877
...and the paranormal himself.

785
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:06,673
But then, one summer,
a young, likable Lieutenant...

786
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:10,385
...named Norman Pendleton was
recruited to the New Earth Army.

787
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:13,888
Desperate to compete with Lyn,

788
00:53:13,972 --> 00:53:19,143
Larry had been doing research into
the infamous CIA MK-ULTRA experiments

789
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,855
...which he believed could enhance
his own psychic powers.

790
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:25,650
All he needed was a lab rat
to try them out on.

791
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,693
To check if they were safe.

792
00:53:29,737 --> 00:53:32,031
It turned out they weren't.

793
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,187
Run! Run!

794
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:07,232
Bullshit!

795
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:19,536
Norm?

796
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:24,999
Norm.

797
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:27,418
Give me the gun.

798
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:35,677
Norm’s father,
who had turned out...

799
00:54:35,718 --> 00:54:38,971
...was pretty high up in the
Pentagon, wanted blood.

800
00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:42,016
Although the Jedi's were pretty
sure Larry was responsible,

801
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,559
...nothing could be proved.

802
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:46,938
And when he was called to
testify at the disciplinary hearing,

803
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:49,815
...Larry made sure to smear Bill
with everything he could.

804
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:53,110
Lieutenant Colonel Django used funds
from the project's black budget...

805
00:54:53,152 --> 00:54:55,029
- to procure prostitutes...
- That's a lie!

806
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,364
...and to get drugs for himself
and his men.

807
00:54:57,406 --> 00:54:58,991
That...

808
00:54:59,408 --> 00:55:02,786
Well, the hooker thing is
definitely a lie.

809
00:55:05,205 --> 00:55:08,459
Brigadier General Hopgood resigned
and died some years later.

810
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:11,545
Bill received a dishonorable discharge.

811
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,347
Continue the work, Lyn.

812
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:27,269
The World needs the Jedi's, now,
more than ever.

813
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:34,526
After Bill left,

814
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:38,488
Major Holtz of Special Forces
took command of the Jedi's.

815
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:42,325
He didn't think much of Bill's
unconventional training techniques...

816
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:44,953
...and he's about to
make some changes.

817
00:55:46,955 --> 00:55:49,582
Nothing was ever the same again.

818
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:49,057
I really appreciate this, sir.

819
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:38,856
Jesus!
We could have bought a map.

820
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:42,109
Bedouins have been navigating
this desert for centuries...

821
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,610
...without a map.

822
00:57:43,735 --> 00:57:46,029
You can use a wristwatch in
conjunction with the sun.

823
00:57:46,113 --> 00:57:47,281
Well?

824
00:57:47,447 --> 00:57:49,866
- Well, what?
- Well, use your wristwatch.

825
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,451
I haven't got a wristwatch.

826
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:53,161
Oh, for the love of...

827
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:54,996
Here.

828
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,707
What?

829
00:57:58,125 --> 00:57:59,709
- It's digital.
- So?

830
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:01,503
You need a watch with hands.

831
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:04,256
How am I supposed to know?
You're the navigation expert.

832
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:05,840
You're the one who said
you could...

833
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,050
...find a way.

834
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,302
- I'll, if you'd just be quiet...
- Turns out you haven't even got a watch!

835
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:10,345
- I don't need a watch.
- How the hell we'll get of here?

836
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:11,971
I'm using Level Two.

837
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:14,307
- What is that?
- Level Two. Intuition.

838
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:16,142
We were trained to make
correct decisions.

839
00:58:16,184 --> 00:58:17,352
Somebody runs up to you...

840
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,478
...and they say
"There's a fork in the road. "

841
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:20,688
Do we go left or do we go right?
And you go...

842
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,522
"We go right!"

843
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:24,734
- What? Just instant?
- Instant. Just like that.

844
00:58:26,235 --> 00:58:29,614
We've been sitting here for half an hour.
How's that "instant?"

845
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:33,784
- Oh, it's this way?
- Yeah.

846
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:35,578
Oh, now you know.

847
00:59:08,777 --> 00:59:10,070
Hang on.

848
00:59:13,073 --> 00:59:14,366
What happened?

849
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:16,535
- IED.
- What?

850
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:20,622
- Improvised Explosive Device.
- Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

851
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:22,832
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

852
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:23,958
I can't believe it.

853
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,835
Great fucking intuition, Lyn.

854
00:59:25,919 --> 00:59:28,755
I can't... put me down.
I can walk.

855
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:31,090
Oh, Jesus!

856
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:33,843
I think I may be
bleeding to death.

857
00:59:34,218 --> 00:59:36,346
You're not bleeding to death.
You're in shock.

858
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,764
It's a shock.

859
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:40,808
It's hot.
I'm so hot.

860
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:42,935
- Aren't you hot?
- Bob?

861
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:45,396
It's really important
you keep your mouth closed.

862
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:48,024
You can lose a lot of water
through an open mouth.

863
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:50,651
If we'd only stayed with the car
then...

864
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:51,777
...we would be alright now.

865
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,405
- Now we've no water, no...
- You're gonna be okay.

866
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:56,198
Would you stop saying that?
I've been...

867
00:59:56,282 --> 00:59:58,117
I've been got blown up!
I'm in the middle of a desert!

868
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,245
- I'm not gonna be okay.
- Bob, you're in shock.

869
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:03,956
If you panic,
your heart's gonna stop.

870
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:07,209
Is that supposed to calm me down?

871
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:09,128
Wait a minute.

872
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:12,131
This is west.

873
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:14,800
Al Qaim is the other way.
We're going the wrong way.

874
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:18,512
Al Qaim isn't the mission.
We're going near Al Qaim.

875
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,222
Where?

876
01:00:21,056 --> 01:00:23,350
- I don't know.
- What?

877
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,519
Is that a joke?
This is a joke, right?

878
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,939
We've come 600 miles and
you don't know where we're going?

879
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:34,027
If the exact whereabouts of the
target was known...

880
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,072
...it wouldn't take a Jedi
to find them, would it?

881
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:39,783
Who gave you the mission, Lyn?

882
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,660
- Bill did it.
- What?

883
01:00:42,827 --> 01:00:46,206
Bill... He appeared in my
trailer two months ago.

884
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:48,333
A psychic projection.

885
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:51,127
- He called out my name.
- Oh, Jesus!

886
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,338
Lyn, there is no mission.

887
01:00:53,546 --> 01:00:57,341
We're in the middle of the fucking desert
because you heard voices?

888
01:00:57,508 --> 01:01:02,013
There's no one here!
There's no one fucking here!

889
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:05,391
When the dust of Bill's discharge
has settled...

890
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:08,060
...it revealed a surprising victor.

891
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:11,689
What you've for me, sergeant?

892
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:14,150
This is a scientific report
I've done...

893
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:17,194
...on possible offensive
psi application, sir.

894
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:20,239
I showed it to Lieutenant Colonel Django,
but he didn't seem interested.

895
01:01:20,322 --> 01:01:22,616
No, I bet he wasn't.

896
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,289
We have men who can do this?

897
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:31,458
I can think of one, sir.

898
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:35,295
But we don't have the resources.

899
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:38,590
Well, sir...

900
01:01:38,757 --> 01:01:40,759
...there is the goat lab.

901
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:46,640
Just 80 yards from Major Holtz's
office was an abandoned hospital.

902
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:49,100
Most of the soldiers
who lived and worked in Fort Bragg

903
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:51,770
...had no idea about the
actual function of this building.

904
01:01:51,853 --> 01:01:53,980
Because,
although it was abandoned,

905
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:56,399
...the hospital was not empty.

906
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,987
The goats have been secretly flown in
from Central America to avoid customs.

907
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:04,365
Special forces weren't worried about
regular soldiers hearing the goats...

908
01:02:04,449 --> 01:02:06,576
...because they'd been de-bleated.

909
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:09,829
Goat Lab was originally created
as a secret laboratory,

910
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:14,167
...to provide in-the-field surgical
training for Special Forces soldiers.

911
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,878
The goats would get shot
in the leg with a bolt gun...

912
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:20,339
...and then a trainee would have
to dress the wound successfully.

913
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,217
Goat lab actually used to be
called Dog Lab.

914
01:02:23,301 --> 01:02:27,179
But it turned out most soldiers didn't
feel good shooting dogs in the leg.

915
01:02:27,722 --> 01:02:31,267
The army, though, had long felt
fine about doing stuff to goats.

916
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,186
Even testing atomic weapons
on them.

917
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,190
It's gone, Bob.

918
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,275
What?

919
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:42,069
I can't find him.

920
01:02:42,444 --> 01:02:44,446
I've lost my powers.

921
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:46,657
It's a curse.

922
01:02:47,032 --> 01:02:47,908
What curse?

923
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:50,327
They took this, beautiful thing
that we've been building...

924
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,996
...and they destroyed the
New Earth Army.

925
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:54,873
Who destroyed it?

926
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,085
I did.

927
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:03,131
Hooper and Holtz wanted me
to do an experiment.

928
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:05,383
They wanted me to
stop the heart of a goat.

929
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,052
What had the goat ever done to me?

930
01:03:07,135 --> 01:03:10,096
It was completely against
the way of the Jedi.

931
01:03:10,305 --> 01:03:11,598
I was just gonna pretend to try...

932
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:14,517
...so that they can see it wouldn't work
and they can forget about it.

933
01:03:14,684 --> 01:03:17,312
Then, as I sat there...

934
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,481
I felt this... pulse

935
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:23,192
...inside me.
I couldn't stop it.

936
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:28,031
Maybe deep down inside...

937
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:32,243
...some dark part of me
wanted to see if I could do it?

938
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,434
Holy shit!

939
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:02,981
That was it.
I'd used my powers for evil and...

940
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,943
...as if I brought a curse
on us all.

941
01:04:06,902 --> 01:04:08,737
It's like that poem where...

942
01:04:08,862 --> 01:04:12,115
...the guy kills the seagull and they
make him wear it round his neck.

943
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:15,202
Every night I'd dream of that goat.

944
01:04:15,243 --> 01:04:19,331
It's mouth opening and closing
without making a sound.

945
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:22,000
The silence of the goats.

946
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:28,548
I finished my tour and I quit.
I walked out.

947
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,799
I never went back.

948
01:04:31,885 --> 01:04:33,470
But before he could leave,

949
01:04:33,553 --> 01:04:36,389
Larry arranged one last parting gift.

950
01:04:37,348 --> 01:04:38,516
What do you...?

951
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:46,983
It was the Dim Mak.

952
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:49,235
- The Dim Mak?
- The Dim Mak.

953
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,903
The Quivering Palm.

954
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,154
The Death Touch.

955
01:04:52,196 --> 01:04:54,448
It's forbidden in the New Earth Army.

956
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:56,659
What does the Death Touch do?

957
01:04:57,243 --> 01:04:58,828
It kills you, Bob.

958
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:01,497
- With one touch.
- Jesus!

959
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:05,459
There's a story that Wong Wifu,
the great Chinese martial artist,

960
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:08,128
...had a fight with a guy
and beat him.

961
01:05:08,212 --> 01:05:11,882
Then the guy gave him
this light tap.

962
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:15,177
Wong looked at him
and the guy just nodded.

963
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:16,887
That was it.

964
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:19,389
He had given him the death touch.

965
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:21,517
Wong died.

966
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:23,727
Then and there?

967
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,520
No.

968
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:27,731
About eighteen years later.

969
01:05:28,106 --> 01:05:29,274
That's the thing about Dim Mak...

970
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:31,735
...you never know
when it's gonna take effect.

971
01:05:37,782 --> 01:05:40,619
In a funny kind of way
I admired Lyn then.

972
01:05:40,744 --> 01:05:42,203
He believed in something
so much...

973
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:44,664
...he thought he could
really die from it.

974
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:48,251
That's what I've been looking
for all along.

975
01:05:48,418 --> 01:05:50,128
Something to believe in.

976
01:05:50,295 --> 01:05:52,839
Something to give meaning
to my life.

977
01:05:53,881 --> 01:05:56,426
So I had fallen for
Lyn's crazy stories.

978
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,512
So I'd followed him
out into the desert.

979
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,336
Look! Look!

980
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,925
Come on! Come on!

981
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:30,059
These are friendly competitions
held between members of the camp.

982
01:07:30,142 --> 01:07:34,021
When you think this sorta things for kids,
you better think again.

983
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,385
Lyn?

984
01:08:13,018 --> 01:08:14,853
Lyn? Where are you going?

985
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:22,110
Lyn?

986
01:09:07,196 --> 01:09:08,780
Hello, Bill.

987
01:09:12,451 --> 01:09:14,036
Hello, Lyn.

988
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:18,623
This is Bob.

989
01:09:19,249 --> 01:09:20,834
Hello, Bob.

990
01:09:21,751 --> 01:09:23,336
Hello.

991
01:09:25,547 --> 01:09:26,840
Oh, good.

992
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,092
The gang's all here.

993
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:33,555
This is primarily a Psyops base.

994
01:09:33,763 --> 01:09:36,724
- Psy for psychic, right?
- Psy for psychological.

995
01:09:36,808 --> 01:09:38,726
The irony isn't wasted on me.

996
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,354
Radio broadcasts, leaflets,
things like that.

997
01:09:41,437 --> 01:09:45,525
Oh, here's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
they dropped on us.

998
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:47,819
"American soldier...

999
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:48,945
...your wives are back at home...

1000
01:09:48,986 --> 01:09:51,072
...having sex with Bart Simpson
and Bert Reynolds. "

1001
01:09:51,114 --> 01:09:53,950
Yeah, didn't exactly done their
homework there.

1002
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:55,785
How did you find us, Lyn?

1003
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,204
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

1004
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:00,748
If this is Psyops base,
what are you doing here?

1005
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:03,501
I said it was primarily Psyops.

1006
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:05,920
There are individuals in the
current administration...

1007
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:08,923
...who're looking for creative solutions
to the war on terror.

1008
01:10:09,006 --> 01:10:11,550
They're far more open minded
than their predecessors,

1009
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:15,137
...and they've outsourced
experimental research to my company.

1010
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:16,847
"Sick?"

1011
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:19,767
It's pronounced psi-ike.

1012
01:10:20,309 --> 01:10:24,813
Psychic Systems International Corp.
"PSIC".

1013
01:10:25,564 --> 01:10:28,817
It turns out certain people had
heard about the New Earth Army.

1014
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,320
They were very interested in some
of the work we were doing back then.

1015
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:33,989
They got a hold on me,
I got a hold on Bill.

1016
01:10:35,574 --> 01:10:37,159
Bill works for you?

1017
01:10:37,242 --> 01:10:40,620
Bill's looking into
subliminal messaging.

1018
01:10:41,746 --> 01:10:43,039
This is the one we've designed...

1019
01:10:43,081 --> 01:10:45,542
...to play to our own troops
before going into combat.

1020
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,210
Push "play" on that.

1021
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:56,094
There's a subliminal message in this?

1022
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:57,262
This one's called...

1023
01:10:57,345 --> 01:11:00,306
"Don't get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns. "

1024
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:03,059
We've got all sorts of new ideas
and development.

1025
01:11:03,142 --> 01:11:04,519
Give them one of our new ideas.

1026
01:11:04,602 --> 01:11:06,312
- Air bag mine?
- Air bag mine.

1027
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:07,688
Non-lethal.

1028
01:11:07,939 --> 01:11:10,358
Catapults the fucker right into the air.
Gimme another one.

1029
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,027
Blast target with pheromones and
then release attack bees.

1030
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:17,156
Excellent. Attack bees.
The forces of nature!

1031
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,824
- Another.
- Project Achilles.

1032
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:22,495
- We mutilate enemy corpses...
- We're not doing that anymore! You idiot!

1033
01:11:23,787 --> 01:11:27,583
The point is... we've got a budget,
we've got supporters.

1034
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:29,293
I'm rebuilding the New Earth Army.

1035
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:31,211
Only this time without
all that hippie crap.

1036
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:35,132
- How you're doing there, Bill?
- Gonna get some ice-cream.

1037
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:45,726
You get the occasional flash of
what he used to be but...

1038
01:11:45,809 --> 01:11:48,228
...he's pretty burnt out
on the booze.

1039
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:51,565
Still, he's the best.
Oh, twizzlers.

1040
01:11:53,316 --> 01:11:55,151
- You want one?
- No.

1041
01:11:55,318 --> 01:11:56,903
God, I love these things.

1042
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,084
What? What is it?

1043
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,837
It's the Dark Side.

1044
01:13:08,098 --> 01:13:10,100
Lyn, what you're gonna do?

1045
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,435
It's too late...

1046
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:18,274
- I'm dying, Bob.
- No, you're not gonna die.

1047
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:20,485
I don't believe
you can be killed by...

1048
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:23,113
- by mail order, Dim Sum, or...
- Dim Mak.

1049
01:13:23,196 --> 01:13:25,490
Dim Mak. Whatever.
You can't just be tapped in the shoulder

1050
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:27,242
It's cancer.

1051
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:29,744
What?

1052
01:13:31,204 --> 01:13:34,332
All I know it's the Dim Mak
that caused it.

1053
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,918
It's cancer.

1054
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,378
At least that's what the doctors said.

1055
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,801
It's different ways
of looking at...

1056
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,555
Different names for a reality.

1057
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:06,071
Give that to Bill.

1058
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,866
I don't deserve it.

1059
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,496
Take it.

1060
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:24,047
It wasn't the Dim Mak
that was killing Lyn.

1061
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,132
And it wasn't the cancer.

1062
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,677
He was dying of a broken heart.

1063
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,388
And maybe, the cancer as well.

1064
01:14:31,888 --> 01:14:33,598
His mission had failed.

1065
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:36,768
And failure was something
I knew too much about.

1066
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,853
Bill?

1067
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:03,586
Lyn told me he didn't deserve
this eagle feather.

1068
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:07,006
He wanted me to
give it back to you.

1069
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:11,802
- It's fake.
- What?

1070
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:17,516
Twenty thousand dollar fine
for taking an eagle feather.

1071
01:15:17,766 --> 01:15:19,768
This one's off a turkey.

1072
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,564
You just die the tip black.

1073
01:15:26,024 --> 01:15:27,609
Don't tell Lyn.

1074
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:31,113
It isn't real.

1075
01:15:32,739 --> 01:15:34,741
None of it was real.

1076
01:15:40,163 --> 01:15:42,457
Lyn told me about the curse.

1077
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,503
That by killing the goat,
he put a curse on all of you.

1078
01:15:49,047 --> 01:15:51,674
What's Larry gonna do
with these goats?

1079
01:15:58,139 --> 01:16:00,433
Do you believe in redemption, Bill?

1080
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:27,376
Sorry.
Didn’t mean to wake you.

1081
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:31,130
How did you find it?

1082
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:34,133
I told you,
I remote viewed you.

1083
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:37,261
Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?

1084
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,596
Yeah, he did.

1085
01:16:40,139 --> 01:16:41,557
We told Scotty
we were coming over here,

1086
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,600
...asked him
if he wanted some work.

1087
01:16:43,684 --> 01:16:45,686
I haven't seen Scotty.

1088
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:49,523
That's funny, because he told me
he'd run into you and mentioned that

1089
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:52,234
...there might be some jobs
going over with.

1090
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:56,446
Isn't that why you came,
really, Lyn?

1091
01:16:58,323 --> 01:17:00,450
You want back in, don't you?

1092
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:02,661
It can happen.

1093
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,829
You've only got to say the word.

1094
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:08,625
This could be the new Golden
Age for psi research.

1095
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,044
You, me and Bill,
back together again.

1096
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,129
Like the old days.

1097
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:21,888
You don't have to make a
decision now.

1098
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,932
Tell me in the morning.

1099
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,154
Mother Earth,
you're my life support system.

1100
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,198
As a soldier
I must drink your blue water,

1101
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:45,786
...live inside your red clay
and eat your green skin.

1102
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,997
Help me to balance myself.

1103
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:51,500
As you hold in balance,
the Earth, the sea,

1104
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,711
...and the space environments.

1105
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,921
Help me to open my heart...

1106
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,757
...knowing that
the Universe will feed me.

1107
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:02,344
I pray my boots
will always kiss your face...

1108
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,472
...and my footsteps match
your heartbeat.

1109
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,059
Carry my body through
space and time.

1110
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:13,605
You're my connection to the Universe
and all that comes after.

1111
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:16,316
I'm yours and you are mine.

1112
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,652
I salute you.

1113
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,115
I salute you.

1114
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:33,791
Bill?

1115
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,752
Bill! Bill?

1116
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:38,755
Bill? Are you okay?

1117
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:43,593
I just saw Timothy Leary.

1118
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:45,720
Timothy Leary is dead.

1119
01:18:46,095 --> 01:18:47,388
I know.

1120
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:50,224
He'd got an idea.

1121
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:57,064
Good evening, gentlemen.

1122
01:18:57,648 --> 01:18:59,650
Gonna get some ice-cream.

1123
01:19:46,112 --> 01:19:47,697
Don't eat the eggs.

1124
01:19:50,992 --> 01:19:54,120
- What?
- Don't eat the eggs.

1125
01:20:21,897 --> 01:20:23,607
What's going on?

1126
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:26,276
We put LSD in the eggs.

1127
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:31,573
Bill showed me where Larry
had some bottles of LSD and...

1128
01:20:31,823 --> 01:20:34,117
We put some in the
powdered eggs last night.

1129
01:20:34,284 --> 01:20:36,119
And in the water.

1130
01:20:37,412 --> 01:20:38,580
What?

1131
01:20:38,664 --> 01:20:41,291
I put it in the main water tank
as well.

1132
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:43,460
But we drank the water.

1133
01:20:45,003 --> 01:20:46,296
Yeah.

1134
01:21:06,983 --> 01:21:08,568
Right. Hold on.

1135
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:12,363
The weather today is gonna be...

1136
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,322
...hot.

1137
01:21:13,364 --> 01:21:15,366
I mean, yeah,
I'm guessing that.

1138
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:17,160
I really didn't looked
at the thing but...

1139
01:21:18,244 --> 01:21:20,997
...I'd say it's gonna be
fucking hot out here!

1140
01:21:21,122 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah. What else?

1141
01:21:26,752 --> 01:21:30,005
I mean, it's a fucking shocker, right?
It's gonna be hot again.

1142
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:36,679
It would have been a good idea
if we hadn't drunk the fucking water?

1143
01:21:36,762 --> 01:21:39,723
Well, that might have aroused suspicion.

1144
01:21:39,848 --> 01:21:41,266
But don't worry.
Over the years,

1145
01:21:41,308 --> 01:21:44,853
I've built up a massive tolerance
to all narcotics.

1146
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:05,498
You're going to hit the gates!
You're going to hit the gates!

1147
01:22:10,128 --> 01:22:12,422
That's cool!
You missed it!

1148
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:22,056
In the name of the New Earth Army
and loving people everywhere,

1149
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:24,600
...I'm liberating you!

1150
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:36,404
I'm liberating this base!

1151
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:49,458
Come on!
Go! Go!

1152
01:22:56,590 --> 01:23:00,469
Come on! Move!
Move on! Come on!

1153
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:38,339
Put the gun down, Larry.

1154
01:23:44,971 --> 01:23:46,139
No!

1155
01:23:50,935 --> 01:23:53,896
Wow, I'm really hungry.

1156
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:00,986
- Come on!
- Let's go! Come on!

1157
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,325
Come with me!

1158
01:24:13,665 --> 01:24:15,667
Don't worry about this guards.

1159
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:27,387
Be free!

1160
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,685
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me!

1161
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:19,730
Where are you going?
What about the mission?

1162
01:25:20,356 --> 01:25:22,775
You are the mission, Bob!

1163
01:25:23,108 --> 01:25:26,987
Tell them what happened.
Tell everybody what happened.

1164
01:25:27,696 --> 01:25:29,698
It's your job now.

1165
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:38,123
At the time I was hurt that
Lyn hadn't taken me with him.

1166
01:25:38,206 --> 01:25:39,207
But now I know,

1167
01:25:39,249 --> 01:25:42,794
...it was because he and Bill
had already seen what was to come.

1168
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:04,941
Nobody exactly knows
what happened.

1169
01:26:05,024 --> 01:26:07,569
The official story is that
their helicopter must have crashed,

1170
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,989
...either because they were hit
by an RPG or because...

1171
01:26:11,114 --> 01:26:11,990
Well, that's what happens...

1172
01:26:12,031 --> 01:26:15,284
...when you fly a helicopter
while you're tripping on acid.

1173
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:19,831
All I know is that
they've never been seen since.

1174
01:26:20,414 --> 01:26:23,542
Like all Shaman,
they returned to the sky.

1175
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:30,132
When I got back,
I wrote the story up.

1176
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:31,509
Everything.

1177
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:34,637
Lyn had handed a mission on
to me and I'd see through it.

1178
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,348
I would tell everyone
what happened.

1179
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:38,432
I understood now that...

1180
01:26:38,474 --> 01:26:40,309
...Debora and I weren’t
meant to be together and...

1181
01:26:40,392 --> 01:26:42,227
...I was at peace with that.

1182
01:26:42,353 --> 01:26:45,898
It wasn't in my destiny to return
to the life I had before.

1183
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:48,609
The Universe has other plans for me.

1184
01:26:48,734 --> 01:26:51,570
I sent the story to the newspapers
and TV stations.

1185
01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:53,322
I didn't care what the authorities
did to me.

1186
01:26:53,405 --> 01:26:56,950
I was ready to go to prison
as long as the truth came out.

1187
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:59,578
But they didn't put me in prison.

1188
01:26:59,786 --> 01:27:01,371
They did something much worse.

1189
01:27:01,455 --> 01:27:04,291
...unusual tool to break
the resistance of Iraqi POWs

1190
01:27:04,374 --> 01:27:07,502
...and trust me,
a lot of parents would agree!

1191
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:10,463
Some prisoners are being forced
to listen to Barney...

1192
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:13,717
...the Purple Dinosaur
sing the "I Love You song",

1193
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,594
...for twenty four straight hours.

1194
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,930
And that was it.

1195
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:23,059
That was the only bit of my story
that ran anywhere.

1196
01:27:23,268 --> 01:27:25,270
And it was a joke.

1197
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:28,898
And if I ever needed proof
of how the Dark Side have...

1198
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,485
...taken the beautiful dream
of what a nation could be...

1199
01:27:32,652 --> 01:27:35,780
...and had twisted it,
destroyed it.

1200
01:27:35,947 --> 01:27:37,532
Well, that was it.

1201
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:41,577
But I won't stop.
I won't give up.

1202
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:45,122
Because when I look at what is
happening in the world,

1203
01:27:45,247 --> 01:27:46,832
I know that now,

1204
01:27:46,999 --> 01:27:49,001
more than ever,

1205
01:27:50,211 --> 01:27:52,296
...we need to be
all that we can be.

1206
01:27:52,338 --> 01:27:53,505
Bob?

1207
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:57,926
Now, more than ever,

1208
01:27:59,386 --> 01:28:01,680
...we need the Jedi.
