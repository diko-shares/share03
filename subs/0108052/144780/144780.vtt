00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:52,391
Stairs

2
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,956
I don't think I can.. ahh

3
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,544
You guys.. Just start without me.

4
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:08,090
Will catch up.. aarg.. ah ah arrh.

5
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:12,922
Heh heh haah.. What's a wait.

6
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:37,590
Inner peace.... Inner.. peace.

7
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:42,809
Ichy nose.. fuhh..

8
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:51,147
Finally. Inner peace.

9
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,151
Now what?

10
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,466
Hai.. Old friend.

11
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,436
Master Oogway. Our battle indeed 500 years ago

12
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:17,150
Well now I'm ready for a rematch.

13
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,850
Took you long enough he he he hee....

14
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,555
You don't stop that..

15
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:47,060
500 years.. in the spirit well, you pick up a thing or two.

16
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:51,908
I have taken the chi of every master here

17
00:02:51,909 --> 00:03:01,795
No.. Yes.. And soon I will have your power too. When
you'll realize the more you take the less you have

18
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:26,824
With your chi, I will finally be able to
return to the mortal world.

19
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:32,290
And this time, you won't be there to stop me.

20
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:38,395
It was never my destiny to stop you.
I have set another on earth perhap..

21
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,369
Then I will find him, and take his chi too.

22
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,714
Justice!, its about to be served.

23
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,980
We'll have two justice platters, please

24
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,020
- umm... three
- And a few tofu bun

25
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,631
Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress.
Did you want extra sauce with that?

26
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,841
She wants it on the side

27
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:13,070
On the side
On the side

28
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,450
dragon you can do it.

29
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,490
Go dragon warrior
Defend the valley

30
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,990
Go dragon warrior
Yeah defend the valley

31
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,300
You guys aren't doing the
dramatic pose, are you?

32
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,900
Do we have to strike the
pose every time we land?

33
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,190
You guys never underestimate
the power of a dramatic entrance.

34
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,710
I've heard about some masters who could win
a fight just by throwing open a door

35
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,876
Dramatic entrance?

36
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,794
Master Shifu

37
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,850
The dragon warrior is great.

38
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,480
Really? I was just making...
yeah I mean yeah I am.

39
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,800
Before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind.

40
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,780
Hence, the dramatic entrance

41
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,790
Whoa, nice dramatic entrance

42
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,520
- What's the occasion?
- Today will be my final class

43
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,990
Your final...? wait
I didn't even know you were sick

44
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,120
Although you have been looking a little...
I'm not sick.

45
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,580
Healthy. A little healthy.
A lot actually

46
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,060
My final class because from now on...

47
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,770
your training will be in the
hands of the dragon warrior

48
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,500
What?

49
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,400
Me? teach? I mean why not Tigress?
She's always telling everyone what to do.

50
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,430
Be quiet Po.
See what I mean?

51
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,700
Tigress is not the dragon warrior.
You are.

52
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,120
Come on they're the five.
What can I teach them?

53
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,150
There is always something more to learn.
Even for a master.

54
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,180
For instance, let me
show you another move.

55
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,150
The dramatic exit.

56
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,030
What's that?

57
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,660
Are you kidding me? that... what?

58
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,760
- Where'd he go?
- Master

59
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,100
He's gone guys. It's cool.
We are await your instruction master.

60
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,440
All you have to lose is our respect.

61
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,980
Seriously how bad could it be?

62
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,101
Leave me...

63
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,190
OK OK let's switch it up.
Monkey, immovable mountain stance.

64
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,899
Yes Master.

65
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,420
I mean... Tigress tornado back flip
Yes, master

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
Oh no fire.
Fire

67
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,860
Sorry, my fault
Crane go high, I mean low

68
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,126
Oh my claw thingy - Viper and
tigress, to... like a totem pole

69
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,253
Poison, Technique.

70
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,320
You two, to... sworming insect bite
with yellow tail, yellow jacket...

71
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,570
Spicy...tuna

72
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,120
Good job, Po.

73
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,740
Did you at least learn a little something?
Yes, that you can't teach.

74
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,630
And tigress is flammable turns out.

75
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,120
That was a complete disaster.

76
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,390
I'm glad we're not Po right now.
What a loser

77
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,970
What was Shifu thinking?
What was Oogway thinking?

78
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,770
I think he heard us.
I didn't hear anything.

79
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,980
He said you're a loser

80
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,720
Sorry Oogway.

81
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,630
Would you stop doing that?
How was your fisrt day teaching?

82
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,930
Humiliating.
I heard.

83
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,650
Who told you?
Did Tigress tell you?

84
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,227
I heard from Monkey and
Crane and Mantis and

85
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,580
your dad and Mrs. Chau
from the gift shop

86
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,300
And those ducks who just passed
and Tigress told me.

87
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,610
Yeah, well did she also tell you that
it'll never happen again cause I'm done?

88
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,750
Teaching, or being humiliated?

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,780
Both. I don't know why you ever thought
I could teach that class?

90
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,290
Oh I knew you couldn't.
What?

91
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
You set me up to fail? Why?

92
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,580
If you only do what you can do
you'll never be more than you are now.

93
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,530
I don't wanna be more
I like who I am.

94
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,300
You don't even know who you are.

95
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,620
What do you...? Of course I do
I'm the dragon warrior.

96
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,460
And what exactly does that
mean dragon warrior?

97
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,670
It means... you know... just going around
and punching and kicking

98
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,200
Defending the valley and stuff.

99
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,080
Punching and kicking?

100
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,110
You think that is what the great
master Oogway saw for you?

101
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,810
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled so
you can spend your days...

102
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,080
Kicking butt? And running through
town high-fiving bunnies?

103
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,027
Yes
No

104
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,700
Oogway saw greatness in you Po
against my better judgment.

105
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,560
More than you can see in yourself.

106
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,110
Incredible power awaits you

107
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,280
Power beyond anything you can imagine.

108
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,160
What was that?
That was chi.

109
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,860
What's chi?

110
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,510
The energy that flows
through all living things.

111
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,475
So you're saying if I,
so you're saying if I

112
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,370
teach, I'll be able to do
cool stuff like that?

113
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,650
No I'm saying if you teach, I'll be
able to do cool stuff like that.

114
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,260
Mastery of chi requires mastery of self

115
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,130
Oogway sat alone in a cave for
thirty years asking one question...

116
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,890
Who am I?

117
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,770
Who am I?

118
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,660
I'm lucky if I get five minutes
before you interrupt.

119
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,680
So now I have to sit alone
in a cave for thirty years?

120
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,690
Eventually.
After you master teaching

121
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,820
Teaching? There's no way
I'm ever gonna be like you.

122
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,070
I'm not trying to turn you into me.

123
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,870
I'm trying to turn you into you.

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,410
Turn me into me?
Wait a second. That makes no...(sense)

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,630
Almost there shifu, just a little more
confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.

126
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,300
Sorry, no offense master Oogway
I just...

127
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,750
I'll let you get back
to your eternal peace.

128
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,280
What is this place?
Aaah... my brother's farm

129
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,920
If I stepped on you, would you die?

130
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes.

131
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,880
The mortal realm.

132
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,920
You hear that Oogway?
I'm back.

133
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,180
Kai has returned.

134
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,930
Who?
Kai. General Kai.

135
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,390
Supreme warlord of all China

136
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,270
I don't know.
The jade slayer, master of pain

137
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,460
You may know me as the beast of vengeance

138
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,510
Maker of widows?

139
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,930
OK I used to work with Oogway.

140
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,360
Oh master Oogway, he was a great warrior.
We've heard of master oogway... Wise and...

141
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,930
OK... Silence.

142
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,360
Find Oogway's students
and bring them to me.

143
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,950
By the time I am done with them Oogway...

144
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,610
There will be no one left who
will even remember your name.

145
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,570
Kai is coming.

146
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,390
I am ready...

147
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,570
to teach you a lesson.
Teach me?

148
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,910
Oh no he's the dragon teacher
Yeah he's so handsome.

149
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,940
Thank you for the compliment.

150
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,210
No, please don't teach me to death

151
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,300
Po?

152
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,080
Oh hey dad
What's up?

153
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,440
I like just ...stopping
by for a little soak.

154
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,340
OK, What's wrong?
Nothing

155
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,010
Nothing? I come home and find you
taking a bath with your dolls.

156
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,170
Action figures. -And instead of
adding bath-salt to the water...

157
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,580
You just added szechuan peppercorns.
Szechuan what?

158
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,190
My tenders.

159
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,620
OK yes, something's wrong - There there
son, you tell your daddy all about it

160
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,210
Lift your arm

161
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,320
Shifu says I don't know what it
means to be the dragon warrior

162
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,370
And now I have to be a teacher.

163
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,350
I thought I finally knew who I was. If I'm
not the dragon Warrior, then who am I?

164
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,790
A teacher? Teaching kung fu?

165
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,110
That's a promotion. Take the job, son

166
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,269
And someday, when you're
in charge of the whole

167
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,170
Jade palace, I can sell
noodles in the lobby

168
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,010
Why are you still here taking a bath like
a baby? Get out. Get out. Go, go, go.

169
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,040
Franchise expansion awaits us.

170
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,040
What about the dragon warrior
look alike contest?

171
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,950
Mrs. Chau always wins that.
Skadoosh

172
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,350
And the dragon warrior
dumpling eating contest?

173
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,700
I have to defend my title

174
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,320
No one's gonna beat your
dumpling eating record.

175
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,940
Someone's about to beat your
dumpling eating record.

176
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,680
Go. Go. Go.

177
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,970
Who's eating my dumplings?
And who's paying for them?

178
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,170
101, 102

179
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,970
Li: 103.

180
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,380
Is that a new record?

181
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,330
Who are you?

182
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,330
I'm Li Shan
What?

183
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,890
I'm Li shan.

184
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm looking for my son.

185
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,150
You lost your son?
Yes, many years ago.

186
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,200
I lost my father
Very sorry

187
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,120
Thank you.

188
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,950
Well, good luck to you.
You too.

189
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,210
I hope you find your son.

190
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,630
And I hope you find your father

191
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,550
Son? Oh my gosh, it is you.

192
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,130
Well don't just stand there
give your old man a hug.

193
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,780
I can't believe you're alive.

194
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,130
I thought I'd lost you forever
little Lotus

195
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,990
This is very embarrassing, but
I think you've got me confused

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,580
with a panda named Lotus.
My name is Po.

197
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh right, you wouldn't... OK

198
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,060
See, the little Lotus was the name
you were given at birth.

199
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,540
Really?
Really.

200
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,000
I can't believe it. After all these
years and you're really here?

201
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,220
This is amazing.

202
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,320
Oh dad. Come say hi to...

203
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,310
I don't know what
I'm supposed to call you.

204
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,310
I'm pretty sure
he said his name is Li

205
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,770
You... come here

206
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,890
Thank you, thank you for taking
such good care of my son.

207
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,960
Your son?
Now hold on just a minute.

208
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,961
How do we know this stranger is
even related to you?

209
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,030
Look at that.
Our bellies could be brothers.

210
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,770
Hey son, let me teach you how to
belly gong. All right, belly gong

211
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
It's like looking in a fat mirror.

212
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,210
I can't believe we're
taking a picture together.

213
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,100
But I still don't understand.
I thought Po was the only panda left.

214
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,710
No, there's a whole bunch of us.
Where?

215
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,290
Here, a secret panda village in the
mountains - A secret panda...

216
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,560
But how did you know where I was?
I received a message that led me here.

217
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,760
How could you receive a message
if no one could find you?

218
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,050
Sounds suspicious to me.

219
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,290
No, wait wait.
It was a message from the universe

220
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,180
Rats.

221
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,370
Now what's all this about
a dragon warrior?

222
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,430
How'd you know I was the dragon warrior?
Did the universe tell you that, too?

223
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,890
No, the poster did and the gift shop
I bought a tiny cup.

224
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,440
Oh right, of course...

225
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,300
You gotta... you have no idea there's
so much to show you.

226
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,151
You're gonna be so awesomely proud.

227
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,910
Come on, come on.

228
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,150
I'm already awesomely proud.

229
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,580
Couple more steps.
Oh

230
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,100
Feeling the burn.

231
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,450
Do you have panda asthma, too?
Does that run in the family?

232
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,290
Dad, you're gonna love this

233
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,190
It's like the coolest thing ever.

234
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,980
This is the hall of heroes

235
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,100
Home of the most priceless
kung fu artifacts in all of China.

236
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,920
This place is...
Awesome?

237
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,121
You were going to say awesome, right?

238
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,990
Because it totally is.
Totally

239
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,310
But be super careful,
everything is very fragile here.

240
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,350
Like the Urn of Whispering warriors.

241
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,020
Someone broke that once.

242
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,750
Who?
Some idiot

243
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,900
This is master flying Rhino's battle armor.
I wonder if I could fit in that

244
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,590
Get out of my head, dad.
I've wondered the same thing.

245
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,260
If I could fit in it?
If you could? No, if I could fit in it.

246
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,360
Dad, check it out.

247
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,900
Master Ram's crossbow
The infinite gates smasher.

248
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,870
Dad, look at this. The battle helmets of
master Rat's army. They're so tiny.

249
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,560
Master Dolphin's water proof armor.
This is my favorite.

250
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,580
Check it out. It's the legendary
battle rickshaw of emperor Hawk

251
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,080
Sweet ride.

252
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,740
Dad, what are you doing?
We're not supposed to touch anything

253
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,241
Oh sorry sorry. Should I put it back?

254
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,400
Yeah you probably should.
You look so cool, though.

255
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,100
How does it feel? Do the hinges hinge?
Does it smell like rhino?

256
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,450
Does it feel like you're impenetrable?

257
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,451
Does it feel like you can take
on a thousand warriors?

258
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,430
And emerge unscathed?

259
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,650
Yes, it's pretty cool.

260
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,950
Wonder what this does?
I should pull it.

261
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,090
I think I just peed a little.

262
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,480
Anything else we should try in here, son?

263
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,880
Charge

264
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,910
Faster, faster, faster

265
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,870
Thumb war
Reinforcements

266
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,600
This is so much fun

267
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,070
Here we go.
Awesome

268
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,430
There, there
I'm fine I'm fine

269
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,050
There you go

270
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
Dolphin style attack

271
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,970
You got me
Dolphin style retreat

272
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,150
Go long son.

273
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,610
I wasn't ready

274
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,940
Coming back at you.
I got it.

275
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Throw high
Yeah, C'mon.

276
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,430
I'm coming for you.
Bring it on master Rhino

277
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,670
Here I come

278
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,450
I'm gonna get you.

279
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,000
Who's gonna get you?

280
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,840
Master Rhino.
Why, what's wrong?

281
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,000
Guys guys, you're never gonna
guess who just showed up.

282
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,551
Not in a million years.

283
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,130
You can't... you just try
Your father

284
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,660
Wow, how did you just guess that?

285
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,661
Oh, wait a second. Yeah of course.
We look exactly the same.

286
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,090
Say hi to my friends, Mantis
Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper

287
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,610
Oh Viper, was it?
Monkey, sir.

288
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,400
They're kind of my best friends.

289
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,680
And this... this is master Shifu.
Legend

290
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,210
It is an honor to meet you, master Panda.

291
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,600
Perhaps your father would care to join us
in the training hall?

292
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,541
Your son will be teaching the class

293
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,710
I'm sure he's tired.
I'm sure you're tired.

294
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,880
He's tired. I'm gonna show him
the chrysanthemums suite.

295
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,230
What? Tired? No, I'm fine.
I would love to watch you teach.

296
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,780
Trust me.
It would be more fun to watch me

297
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,120
Fight

298
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,290
What is that?
The valley is under attack.

299
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,920
Son? Under attack?
This is perfect

300
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,110
Now you can see what being
the dragon warrior is all about.

301
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
Follow me.

302
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,550
Enemies of justice.
Prepare for... whoa

303
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,180
Are you kidding me?

304
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,160
What's the deal with the green guys?

305
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,060
Some kind of jade zombies.
Jade zombies?

306
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
Jombies, Jinx

307
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,790
Lotus be careful
It's OK dad. I do this every...

308
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,500
Whoa. I recognize this guys.
The master Badger twins.

309
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,270
With their crushing double gong
technique

310
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,880
Yeah that's the one.
That guys is... no

311
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,960
Master Porcupine.

312
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,080
I thought he died hundred
hundred years ago

313
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,020
These guys are legends.

314
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,130
Get a quick sketch of us.

315
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

316
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,850
Aw, I blinked.
Can we get another one?

317
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm being choked by master Porcupine.
This is so cool.

318
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,900
Look. It's you.
Po, focus.

319
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,340
Message from universe? I'll give you
one message from the universe...

320
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,230
Stay away from my son.

321
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,030
Sorry dad. I'll clean it up later. -Whoa,
whoa, not my good pan. Take this one.

322
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,100
Lotus, watch out.

323
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,160
Dad, check out my dumplings of doom.

324
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,010
Gotcha.

325
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,810
I see you.

326
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,580
Your chi will soon be mine.

327
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,280
Is he talking to me?
Which one? They're all talking.

328
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
Whoa, you're right.
That's so scary.

329
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,450
We should try that, too.
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.

330
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,100
OK but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first

331
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,850
otherwise it won't be scary,
it'll be just stupid.

332
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:49,690
It's not them talking. Idiots.

333
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,090
It's me talking through them, Kai.

334
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,810
Who?
OK OK, enough.

335
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,930
Did you see that? Did you see?
Whoa, what just happened?

336
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,810
The green smoke just poof... and then poof
Shifu, what wast that?

337
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,770
Kai? Kai? Kai

338
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,320
Nope. Never heard of him.

339
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,400
Kai, where is it?
There's so much wisdom in here,

340
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,640
I can't find anything.

341
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,980
Yes

342
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,440
Behold.

343
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,860
All the answers will be found within.

344
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,440
What? It's blank?

345
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,280
Are you kidding me?
Not again.

346
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,160
Wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry
Oh OK, here we go.

347
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,550
It is written in Oogway's hand.

348
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,940
Long ago, I had a brother.
Oogway had a brother?

349
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,900
In arms. In arms, sorry.

350
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,580
He said brother in arms.
Can you just unroll it all at once?

351
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,120
I was an ambitious young warrior
leading a great army.

352
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,820
And fighting by my side was Kai.

353
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,920
My closest friend.

354
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,300
One day we were ambushed.
I was badly wounded.

355
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,480
My friend carried me for days
looking for help.

356
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,210
Until we came to a secret
village, high in the mountains.

357
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,360
An ancient place of healing.

358
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,060
A village of pandas.

359
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,220
Pandas?
Yes, pandas.

360
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,020
Pandas who used the power
of chi to heal me.

361
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,730
They taught me how to give chi.

362
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,500
But Kai wanted the power all to himself.

363
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,010
He saw that what could be given
could also be taken.

364
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,670
I had to stop him.

365
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,050
Our battle shook the Earth.

366
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,290
Until, finally, I banished Kai to
the spirit realm.

367
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,200
Should he ever return to the mortal realm

368
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,320
he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi.

369
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,430
True master of chi?
Like you.

370
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,590
Me? I can barely make a flower bloom.

371
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,160
I'd need at least thirty
more years, and a cave.

372
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,200
Viper: We need a chi master.

373
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,649
Shifu: He will continue stealing the chi
of masters until he has consumed it all.

374
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,870
Viper: We have to make a way to stop him.

375
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,960
Crane: Oh get more more powerful
with every master he defeats.

376
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,959
Tigress: There is no choice. We fight.

377
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,210
I can teach you, son.

378
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,640
You can do this?
Of course, I'm a panda.

379
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,950
That must be why the universe
sent you here.

380
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,930
OK, so what do I have to do?

381
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,950
You have to come home with me.

382
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,820
To the secret village?
Yes, son.

383
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,700
You must rediscover what
it is to be a panda.

384
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,450
You have to learn how to live like a panda.
Sleep like a panda.

385
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,040
Eat like a panda.

386
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,710
Those 103 dumplings?
Hmm... I was just warming up.

387
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,220
I've always felt like I wasn't
eating up to my full potential.

388
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,910
You can't take Po away from me. No, no
I want a second opinion.

389
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,770
Shifu, open another scroll or something.

390
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,830
I think he should go.
Fine. A third opinion.

391
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,920
Monkey? Viper? Tigress?
Dad you heard what Shifu said Oogway said.

392
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,770
This guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi.

393
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,460
And I can only master chi by knowing
who I really am.

394
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,350
Well, I'm a panda.

395
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,720
I'll pack your lunch for the road.

396
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,120
Do you really think Po can master chi in time?
-Doesn't matter what I think.

397
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,220
It only matters what the universe think.
So, that's a No?

398
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,110
Master, what are we going to do?
You are going to find out where Kai is.

399
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
Follow the trail of those jade creatures
but do not engage

400
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,210
For with every foe he faces
Kai becomes stronger.

401
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,450
Why me? Is it because I asked.
No, it is because you can fly.

402
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,870
Go.
Should be kept your beak shut.

403
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,700
And take Mantis.
What? Oh man, is it because I ...?

404
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,520
Yes

405
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,990
Lunch break?
You don't need to ask me twice.

406
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,820
Dad?
Yes.

407
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,050
Dad?
Yes.

408
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,240
What are you doing here?
What am I doing? Getting a backache.

409
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,310
Did you have to step on every rock?

410
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,820
No, I mean why are you here?
What was I supposed to do, huh?

411
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,080
What if the pandas don't
have food you like?

412
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,800
You're never gonna be able to save
the world on an empty stomach.

413
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,460
I consider my presence mission critical.

414
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,820
Oh yes about that. We can't share
the location of the village with others.

415
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,220
So... -Well, you think I
can't keep a secret, huh?

416
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,670
I raised Po for twenty years before
I finally told him he was adopted.

417
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,610
Seriously?
Yeah.

418
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,150
OK, I guess it would be cruel
to make you fly back.

419
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,570
You can fly?
I'm a bird, Po.

420
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,250
We're here.

421
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,670
Sure looks like a long ways up there.

422
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,800
And my son hates stairs.
So let's go home.

423
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,370
We're pandas.
We don't do stairs.

424
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,040
I've waited my whole life
to hear those words.

425
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,740
Rats.

426
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,360
Whoa

427
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,820
This is the secret panda village?
No wonder you keep it a secret.

428
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,880
If I lived here,
I wouldn't tell anyone either.

429
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,130
Now you can whoa.
Whoa.

430
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,650
Li?
Everyone, Li is back.

431
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,740
They're both back.
He found his son.

432
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,910
He made it.
They're back.

433
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,610
Li?
He found his son.

434
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,430
Everyone, Li is back.

435
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,580
Hang on, we're coming.

436
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,000
He made it.

437
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,910
Why are we running?

438
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,630
He made it.
Li shan is back.

439
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,340
Everyone, everyone gather around.
This is my son.

440
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,210
Triplets.
Hi, I'm Ku Ku

441
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,210
I'm Meng Meng
I'm Shuai Shuai, he smells like cookies.

442
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,750
He's so handsome. Just like his father.
Thank you.

443
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:32,640
Son, these are your cousins.
Dim and Sum.

444
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,100
I have cousins.
Welcome.

445
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,350
Whoa, buns on a string.
We call it a snacklace.

446
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,180
That's right.

447
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,680
We'll make you another one.

448
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,840
It's you.

449
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,380
Oh, that's nice to see you. Hi
I don't know who you are.

450
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,960
Oh, stripy baby. So beautiful.

451
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,420
OK, careful with that.
That's my action figure. Can I keep her?

452
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,510
No...problem. Of course,
yeah that's why I brought her.

453
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:01,809
Take good care of her.

454
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,360
Yes, stripy baby.

455
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,840
You look just like me
but a baby.

456
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,770
You're like me but old.
You're like me but fatter.

457
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,360
You're like me but...

458
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,620
with a hat.

459
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,550
You all look like me.

460
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,470
Let's feast in my son's honor.

461
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,670
What the...?
Pandas don't walk. We roll.

462
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,870
How you ever seen anyone
look so ridiculous?

463
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,920
Po, what are you doing? Po?

464
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,730
You're right.
That is better than walking.

465
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,090
What kind of panda doesn't know
how to roll?

466
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,350
Well, I'm kinda new at this whole
being a panda thing.

467
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,330
And what kind of panda are you?
You have a funny neck.

468
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,460
I'm not a panda at all.

469
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,550
What's that?
My hat, My beak, My wing, My dumplings.

470
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,500
No more questions.
Go away, kid.

471
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,000
Here, son, I packed your chopsticks.
Thanks, dad.

472
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,020
What?
What are those for?

473
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,320
These? These are chopsticks
They're for picking up dumplings.

474
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,640
You mean you only eat one at a time?

475
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,270
I knew I wasn't eating
up to my potential.

476
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,990
I am Mei Mei.

477
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,650
Wow, she's amazing.
She's so beautiful.

478
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,378
That's sweet, Po but
please try to save all

479
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,200
other compliments until
after the performance.

480
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,860
Me? No, I didn't say...

481
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,450
Shut it.
After the performance.

482
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,030
Has it started yet?

483
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,520
Best ribbon dancer in the world

484
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,050
At least that's what she says.
Look away, look away.

485
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,580
No, you can't. Can you?

486
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,980
Dad, why does she keep staring at me like that?
-Try to keep up.

487
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,730
I don't really know how to dance.
Of course you do.

488
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,370
All pandas dance.

489
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,170
I know what you're thinking.
You do?

490
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,620
How can one panda be so beautiful?

491
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,100
For me?

492
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,110
Help me, dads.
Yeah, no. You're on your own.

493
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,490
You're doing great, son.

494
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,190
Your turn.

495
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,730
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.

496
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,590
I have so much to learn.

497
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,550
Wings of surveillance.

498
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,550
Why do you do that?
Do what?

499
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,130
Just because you say "Wings of..."

500
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,031
before something it doesn't mean
that you're doing a special move.

501
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,800
It's like me saying,
"Antenna of power" or...

502
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,440
" Thorax of making sandwiches"

503
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,840
Wings of disagreement.
Whoa, there.

504
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,580
Master Bear, master Chicken, Master Croc,
what are you doing out here?

505
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,680
Jade creatures attacked our villages.
We've tracked them here. Stop.

506
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,070
They must be in there.

507
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,890
Master Shifu strongly advised us...

508
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,420
not to engage.
Gotta get in there.

509
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,580
But master Shifu said...
You're seriously afraid?

510
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,370
Even master Chicken's going in there
and he's a chicken.

511
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,380
That's it, I'm going in.
Mantis, we have orders not to...

512
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,280
They need our help. Come on.
I'll go high, you go low.

513
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,450
No, wait.

514
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,520
Fear the bug.

515
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,630
Alright, you little...

516
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,530
Hold on, buddy. I'm coming.
"Antenna of power"

517
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,590
Ah, it didn't work.
Mantis.

518
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,860
Mantis?

519
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,290
Mantis?

520
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,310
Your chi is strong
just like your friend, the bug.

521
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,270
Mantis

522
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,790
Don't worry, little birdie.
I'll put your chi to good use.

523
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,220
Destroying the Jade palace
and everyone in it.

524
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,500
No.

525
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,210
Wings of... regret.

526
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,540
Oh yeah, first day of panda training.
Alright flower, I'm gonna make you bloom.

527
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,730
Dad, dad.

528
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,870
What? What? What is it? -I'm ready
for my first day of panda training.

529
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,200
What?

530
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,560
You know, learn to be a panda,
master chi, save the world.

531
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,920
Pandas sleep till past noon.

532
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,120
So lesson number one is
go back to bed.

533
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,620
Of course.

534
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,460
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

535
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,920
Did I oversleep?
You sure did.

536
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,110
Yes

537
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,060
Yeah show him kids.
Can you do this? Can you do that?

538
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,630
How about this? How about that?

539
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,790
Am I doing it? Is this good?

540
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,210
I got it.

541
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:47,460
Grandma panda, heads up.
We better roll.

542
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,360
Po, lunchtime.

543
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,860
You gotta let the hill tell you
where to roll.

544
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,030
Rookie mistake.
Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill.

545
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,290
That's beautiful.
Snack time.

546
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,520
Po, you can fly?
I'm coming in hot.

547
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,430
Get them while they're cold.

548
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,520
What are you doing there?
That food is for Po.

549
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,100
Throw it in.

550
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,670
There, there, that's it.

551
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,900
Feeling relaxed?
Yeah, really.

552
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,010
Just let yourself fall into it.
Got it.

553
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,090
I'm fine. I just...

554
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,230
There we go.
Just let it all out.

555
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,160
That's my boy.

556
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,720
Get out of there.

557
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,570
My noodles. Leave my noodles alone.

558
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,040
Subtle, Po. Very subtle.
Let me get some of that.

559
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,350
Leave my hat alone.

560
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,530
We love noodles.
Oh, just like my Po.

561
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,850
What are you guys looking at?

562
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,040
That's how we roll.
Cannonball.

563
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,180
Yeah

564
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,500
Mom, look it

565
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,370
How was that?

566
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,910
Whoa

567
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,260
Now you try again but don't try so hard.
OK, OK.

568
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:11,950
Much better.

569
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,220
Thanks, dad.
For what?

570
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,310
You know, just for you know,
showing me what it feels like...

571
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,960
to be a panda.

572
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,960
So when do you think I'll be ready?
Ready?

573
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,040
You know, learn how to master chi.

574
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,630
Soon, real soon.

575
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,080
Come on.
I wanna show you something else. C'mon

576
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,640
Sorry about the mess,
I don't usually get visitors.

577
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,350
Is this my mom?

578
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,890
I had this done on your
one hundredth day.

579
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,650
Your mama couldn't hold you still.

580
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,760
You nearly eat the paper.

581
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,470
It's true.
What was she like?

582
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,820
She was the total package.

583
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,170
Smart, beautiful.

584
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,240
Tremendous appetite.

585
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,240
She was the love of my life.

586
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:39,500
And then, just when I thought
I couldn't get any luckier.

587
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,530
Along you came, my little Lotus.

588
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,990
I really had it all.

589
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,130
Until that one moment...

590
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,480
When I...

591
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,950
lost everything.

592
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:45,530
Dad, you don't have to worry about
losing me ever again, OK?

593
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,760
Let me get some of that.

594
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,180
It's from the eastern province.

595
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,500
Master Lizard, master Ox, master Eagle,
all of them.

596
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,300
In every village from the sea to here.
Every master in china...

597
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,190
has vanished.
Maybe they are all at a party?

598
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,670
Monkey.
I didn't get invited either.

599
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:26,790
Kai has taken their chi.

600
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:31,540
We are all that stand between him and
the knowledge Oogway left

601
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,270
in our care.

602
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,690
The villagers, evacuated?
Done, master.

603
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,160
Crane? Mantis?
Still nothing.

604
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,650
Wait, it's them.

605
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,010
Kai

606
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,010
Nice, very tacky.

607
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,410
How dare you set foot on these grounds

608
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,840
Look at your pathetic fools.

609
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,880
Groveling at the feet of
Oogway the magnificent.

610
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,640
You are not fit to speak his name.

611
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,860
I am not fit, little kitten?

612
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:32,170
I fought by his side. I loved
him like a brother.

613
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,980
And he betrayed me.

614
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:43,830
Well now I will destroy
everything he has created.

615
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,000
Go.

616
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,490
How's that for a little kitten?

617
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,930
I will not let you destroy
Oogway's memory.

618
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,880
Why not?
He destroyed mine.

619
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,630
Mantis, it is me, your bestie.

620
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,340
Sorry Tigress.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

621
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,300
Shifu.
Bring them to me.

622
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,250
No, you must warn Po.
Master please

623
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,300
I will show you the true
power of chi, brother.

624
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,130
No.

625
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,940
Oogway, forgive me.

626
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,490
Hmm, what do you say Oogway?
Do you forgive him?

627
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,890
You may have destroyed the Jade palace

628
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,280
but you will never succeed.

629
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,790
There will always be someone to stop you.

630
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:29,370
Who? The panda?
His chi is strong but

631
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,410
it won't be enough.

632
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:36,320
He will meet the same fate as you
No.

633
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,790
And so will every panda in that village.

634
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,600
Yes.

635
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,150
Po, I hope you're ready.

636
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,430
Dance Lotus, dance.

637
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,300
He's so handsome.

638
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,040
Hi
That's a panda hug.

639
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,540
Hey

640
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,560
Po

641
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,420
Tigress?

642
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,330
Who's she?

643
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:06,030
Baby stripy baby.
What are you doing here?

644
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,550
Kai attacked the valley.
He's taken every master in china

645
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,350
including Shifu and the others.
It's...it's all gone, Po.

646
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,080
Everything, everyone.
Everyone?

647
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,580
Everyone.
How's my restaurant?

648
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,820
We'll talk later.
And now he's on his way here.

649
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,740
He's after you, Po.
He's after all pandas.

650
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,650
How long do we have?
Not long.

651
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,940
Please tell me you've mastered chi.

652
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,740
Here, take the baby. OK,
who belongs to this one?

653
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,230
You need to teach me
the secret chi technique now.

654
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,480
I'm afraid you need more time.
Everyone, go get your things.

655
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,870
Let me hand you that.
- I don't have more time. I need to learn it now.

656
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,360
Sorry, you're not ready.

657
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,250
OK, pack everything.
I am ready.

658
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,000
Not quite
What are you talking about?

659
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:50,181
I've done everything you've asked.

660
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,720
I mastered napping,
sleeping in hammocks, hot tubs.

661
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,710
I am totally involved
with my panda parts

662
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,820
Now why won't you show me?
Because I don't know it.

663
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:03,410
You what?

664
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,160
I don't know it, OK?

665
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,800
No one does.
Maybe we used to but...

666
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,750
But not anymore.
You lied?

667
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,600
No, I...

668
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,480
Yes.
Why?

669
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:18,999
To save your life.

670
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:22,979
I find out some blade-swinging
maniac is coming for you

671
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,530
What am I supposed to do?

672
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,490
Just let that happen?
Yes, I'm the dragon warrior.

673
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:31,050
Facing maniacs, that's my job.

674
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,990
But because of you
I left the valley unprotected.

675
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,000
I left my friends unprotected.

676
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,090
And now they're all...
they're all...

677
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,870
And you would have been, too.

678
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,940
I lost you once.
I am not going to lose you again.

679
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,620
I can't.

680
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,820
You just did.

681
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,200
Mom, pick me.

682
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,750
Po, I'm so worried for you that I can't
even enjoy being right about everything.

683
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,870
Now run, run, run, as fast as
those chubby legs can go.

684
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,080
Run? There's nowhere to run.
What are you going to do?

685
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,680
I'm gonna stay and
fight that monster.

686
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:34,480
Po, he may be a monster
but he's still your father.

687
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,630
Not him, Kai.
No

688
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,050
Hungry?
No, I... not really.

689
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,600
Well, maybe just one.

690
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:33,530
You know, you weren't the only one
who was lying.

691
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,850
I didn't really come along because
I was worried Po would go hungry.

692
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,560
I was worried about you.
Worried that I'd go hungry?

693
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:47,480
No, I was worried you'd steal Po from me.
I'd what?

694
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,000
I know. That was crazy.

695
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:56,530
But I realized having you in Po's life
doesn't mean less for me.

696
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,730
It means more for Po.

697
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:04,550
Well I'm not in his life.

698
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,440
Not any more.
Your son got mad at you.

699
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,700
Welcome to parenthood.
You don't understand

700
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,050
I lied to him.
He'll never forgive me.

701
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,170
I lied to him for twenty years.
He still thinks he came from an egg.

702
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:24,790
Sometimes we do the wrong things
for the right reasons.

703
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,360
Look, he's hurt.

704
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:41,100
He's confused
and he still has to save the world.

705
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,730
He needs the both his dads.

706
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,120
This isn't going to work.
It has to.

707
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,990
You 're not thinking straight.
I am.

708
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,120
You're not.
I am

709
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,600
No
Yes, I am

710
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,660
I've seen Kai.
I've seen what he can do.

711
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,230
But he hasn't seen what
I can do.

712
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,200
The Wuxi finger hold?
That's my best move.

713
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,090
I just have to get to Kai,
grab his finger, and then Skadoosh.

714
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:28,696
Back to the spirit realm.

715
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,730
He has an army of jade warriors.

716
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,290
Everything they see he sees
so there's no sneaking up on him.

717
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,280
You will never get close enough.
It's gonna work.

718
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,800
He can only be stopped by a master of chi.

719
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,010
Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the chi.
Chi this. Chi that. Chi chi.

720
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,800
I'm not a master of chi. OK?
I don't know if I'm the dragon warrior.

721
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,370
I don't even know if I'm a panda.
I don't know who I am.

722
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,230
You're right. There's no way
I can stop him and his army.

723
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:06,340
Unless you had an army of your own.

724
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,640
You?
Not just me.

725
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,170
Us.
All of us.

726
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,810
I finally found my son
after all these years.

727
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,270
It's gonna take a lot more than
the end of the world to keep us apart.

728
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,290
But you don't even know kung fu.
Then you will teach us.

729
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,140
What? I can't teach you kung fu.
I couldn't even teach Tigress.

730
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,330
And she already knows kung fu.

731
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,210
Po, I know I'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now.

732
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:55,200
But you gotta believe me.
We can do this.

733
00:59:55,230 --> 01:00:00,070
We can learn kung fu.
We can be just like you.

734
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,970
What did you just say?
We can do this?

735
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,770
No.

736
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,420
We can learn kung fu?
After that.

737
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,540
We can be just like you?

738
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,900
Yes.
We can?

739
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,900
No, you can't.

740
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,640
But you don't have to be.

741
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,780
That's what Shifu meant.
I don't have to turn you into me.

742
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:23,090
I have to turn you into you.
That doesn't make any sense.

743
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,570
I know.

744
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:28,320
Thanks, dads.
You're welcome?

745
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,870
I'm gonna do something I never thought
I'd be able to do.

746
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,780
I'm gonna teach kung fu.

747
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,370
You guys, your real strength comes
from being the best you you can be.

748
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,100
So who are you?
What are you good at?

749
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,380
What do you love?
What makes you you?

750
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,700
Yes, good.
Good, again.

751
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
Good, again.

752
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,150
Good, good, good, again.

753
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,300
Huh?
Stripy baby, stripy baby.

754
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,840
Faster, faster.
Roll those ribbons.

755
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,000
Hug that log you, hug that log
like it's the last time

756
01:01:08,002 --> 01:01:10,269
you're ever gonna hug it.
Goodbye forever.

757
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,490
Higher, and a little more to the
left this time. You can do it.

758
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,440
I don't wanna see any of these
hit the ground.

759
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,900
Wait, wait, stripy baby.

760
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,950
Good, try it with this.

761
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,320
Now try it with these.

762
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,300
Good, now try it with these.

763
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,540
They are ready.

764
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,310
What?

765
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,810
OK pay attention cause I might gonna
go over this ten more times.

766
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,770
The only entrance to the village is here.

767
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,830
The dumpling squadron
will take position here

768
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:36,829
while the cookie squadron
will take position here.

769
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,260
Now, on my signal,
the two squadrons will...

770
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:45,220
Alright OK.
The noodle squadron will...

771
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,510
anyway, the important thing to remember
is that this is the spot where...

772
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,890
OK, I saw that coming.
If you only remember one thing,

773
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,340
it's just distract the jombies until
I get close enough to put the

774
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,100
Wuxi finger hold on Kai. Got it?

775
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,280
Pandas on three. One, two, three
panda, you guys...

776
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,390
Never mind.
I'll teach you that later.

777
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,130
I wish I could have thought
you this, son.

778
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:55,150
It's OK, dad. I'm...

779
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,110
He's here.

780
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,200
That's what I call a dramatic entrance.

781
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:38,400
Haha, you must be the dragon warrior.

782
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:41,100
And you must be Kai.

783
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,020
Beast of vengeance, maker of widows.

784
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,110
Yes, finally.

785
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:51,820
Thank you, almost makes me wanna spare your life.
-Oh, you wanna spare me?

786
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:56,190
How about you spare me the chitchat?
Let's do this.

787
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,970
I'm going to take your chi then the chi
of every panda in the...

788
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,970
Oh, chitchat.
In the...

789
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,060
Chitty chitty chat chat chat chat chat

790
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,680
in the...
Chitchat.

791
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,940
Oh, you pudgy little...

792
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,590
Round them all up.

793
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,570
Oh no, it's true.
You guys have all been turned green.

794
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:37,330
Except for you, Mantis,
you were already green.

795
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,610
Now?
Wait for the signal.

796
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,790
Here we go.

797
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,510
Dumpling squad

798
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,380
Ready?
Go time.

799
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:00,680
Belly
Gong

800
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,860
Seriously?
We did it.

801
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,680
Sorry, Crane.

802
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:19,530
Spring roll squad
Time for some takeout.

803
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,450
Over here, Mr. jombie.

804
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,630
I don't know who you are either.

805
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,140
Noodle squad.

806
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:45,860
Get ready to dance with danger.

807
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,460
Sweet.

808
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,790
Stripy baby

809
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:11,100
Do it.
You're mean.

810
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,280
Fire.

811
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,140
Fire in the hole.

812
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,430
Yes

813
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,040
All right kids.
You got it guys.

814
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,680
Oh no, master Shifu.

815
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:39,900
I can't hit Shifu.

816
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,190
I can.
And so can I.

817
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,410
Double dad defense

818
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,740
Left, dad
Right, dad.

819
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,570
Thanks dad.

820
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:50,810
Back at you then.

821
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,460
We've got this, son.
Go, dads.

822
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:04,520
We got 'em now.
Stop, stop, enough.

823
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,080
Let's finish this.

824
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,980
That's our boy.

825
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,320
Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to
the spirit realm. Skadoosh.

826
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:42,930
OK, that didn't work.
Let me try one more time. Skadoosh

827
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,450
Skadoosh, skadoosh, skadoosh.
What the?

828
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,690
Hold on, wait. It's working.

829
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,430
No, no.

830
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:58,580
No, it's not. Did Oogway
teach you that little trick?

831
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:02,430
Too bad. It only works on mortals.

832
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,500
And I am a spirit warrior.

833
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,080
Come

834
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,130
Son
Po

835
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:02,330
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
Run, run.

836
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:19,640
So Oogway, this was the one
destined to stop me?

837
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:24,740
I will have his chi
and then all of theirs.

838
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,070
And you...

839
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:48,830
You really thought you can
send me back to the spirit realm?

840
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,430
You are just a stupid mortal.

841
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,570
It only works on mortals.

842
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,900
You're right.
I can't send you there.

843
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:09,000
But I can take you there.
What's that?

844
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,240
What?

845
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,230
Po
Son

846
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:15,200
Skadoosh

847
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,010
Son

848
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:18,940
No

849
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,880
What happened?
Where is Po?

850
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:46,590
He took Kai away.
He saved us.

851
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:48,270
No.

852
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,410
He saved us
but who's saving him?

853
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,630
Whoa, the spirit realm.
It worked.

854
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:03,450
Get off me, you...

855
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,430
You brought me back?

856
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:09,520
Don't blame me. I tried to finish this
in the regular realm.

857
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,980
And we'll finish it here.

858
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,170
Come on, son.
Fight.

859
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,050
We have to help him.

860
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,930
Everyone gather around.
That's it. Come in close.

861
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,500
Come on.
We can do this.

862
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,520
Po, you taught us who
we were meant to be.

863
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:22,170
A father.

864
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,650
A friend.
A dumpling kicker.

865
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:32,300
A lethal fighting machine.
A huger.

866
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,470
A nunchuck chick.

867
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,450
Stripy baby.

868
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,940
A family

869
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,270
Sweet.

870
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,620
Who are you?
I've been asking the same question.

871
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,300
Am I the son of a panda?

872
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,780
The son of a goose?
A student?

873
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,590
A teacher?

874
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,690
Turns out, I'm all of them.

875
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,750
I am the dragon warrior.

876
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,540
Get it?
See the giant dragon?

877
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,580
Get ready to feel the thunder.

878
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,870
This is awesome.

879
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,790
Belly gong.

880
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:39,590
Butt slap.

881
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,290
Perhaps a bit of lunch
cause I'm starving.

882
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,750
Let's do this.

883
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,120
Heads up.

884
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:30,230
It took me five hundred years
to take Oogway's chi.

885
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,810
I will have yours if it takes me
five hundred more.

886
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,620
Chtity chitty chat chat, chitchat.

887
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:50,910
You want my chi so bad?
Then take it.

888
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:01,980
Yes, the power is mine.

889
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:09,930
Wait, no. It's too much.
That's too much. No

890
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,400
No

891
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,210
Where'd he go?

892
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,860
We're back.
Bestie.

893
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,860
I'm still green. It didn't work.

894
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,270
Oh wait, that's my normal green.

895
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,210
Stripy baby
Not a baby, not a baby.

896
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,720
What about Po?

897
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,420
Have you seen Po?
No, he's not here?

898
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,380
Po...Po

899
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:58,320
Why isn't he back?

900
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:12,260
Dragon warrior.
Oogway?

901
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,550
I can't believe it.

902
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:21,170
Whoa, you're extra shiny.
As are you.

903
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,480
I know, right?
It's like the best cape ever.

904
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:25,479
When I run with it,
then it looks really cool.

905
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,800
It suits you.
You've grown.

906
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,870
Yeah, I gotta lay off the panda buffet.
Grown up.

907
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:36,690
As I hoped you would when
I sent the message to your father.

908
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,100
You sent the universe mail? Whoa

909
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,310
Yes because the universe needed you.

910
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,520
You finally became the panda
you were always meant to be.

911
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:56,110
But how'd you know I could?
On the first day we met...

912
01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:00,210
I saw the future of kung fu.

913
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,740
And the past

914
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,510
I saw the panda
who could unite them both.

915
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,500
That is why I chose you, Po.

916
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,390
Both sides of the Yin and Yang.

917
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:21,680
And my true successor

918
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,550
Me? I can't take that
Yes, take it.

919
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,780
I have a bigger one.

920
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,960
I mean, you're enlightening everything
I'm just...

921
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,820
Really?
Yes.

922
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:52,680
Now what we do?

923
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,280
Hmm, you tell me.
No Oogway, don't go.

924
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,330
I'm not going anywhere.
I live here.

925
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,990
Oh right.

926
01:20:02,996 --> 01:20:06,999
It's you who must decide
whether to stay or go.

927
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,610
Wait, I can go back?
Who knows?

928
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,290
I've never tried.

929
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:44,180
Po
You can fly.

930
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:54,470
Dad, dad, dads.
Son.

931
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,000
Don't you go disappearing
in petals ever again.

932
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,150
We thought we lost you.

933
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:05,750
No, you saved me.
You all did.

934
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:09,630
Now come on over here.

935
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,420
Hugs

936
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:19,010
Master Shifu.
The student has truly become the tea...

937
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,050
Wait, where did you get that?

938
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:24,049
Oh this. Oogway gave it to me
in the spirit realm.

939
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:28,260
Of course he did.
I think I mastered chi.

940
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:32,130
Of course you did.

941
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,020
Can you teach me?

942
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,810
Ready

943
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,970
Monkey, help me.
Greeny baby.

944
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,170
Get off me.

945
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,600
Hello

946
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,520
Skadoosh

947
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,260
Panda asthma
