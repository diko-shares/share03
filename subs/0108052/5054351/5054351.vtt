00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:23.435
Name?

2
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:24.894
Horowitz, Salomon.

3
00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:30.775
Schneider, Sarah.

4
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.402
Birnbaum, Olga.

5
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.615
- Over there. Over there!
- Kommen sie doch.

6
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.410
Isak Hudes.

7
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.290
Zucker, Helena.

8
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.584
Zucker, Helena.

9
00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:49.586
Hirsch, Salomon?

10
00:02:49.712 --> 00:02:51.004
Hirsch, Salomon.

11
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.881
Hauptman, Chaim!

12
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.716
Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

13
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.259
Feber, Ludwig!

14
00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:57.761
Feber, Ludwig.

15
00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.262
Elsa Bauman.

16
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.308
- Josef Klein.
- Klein.

17
00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:04.768
Davidowich, Ignacy.

18
00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:06.186
Paula Biffer.

19
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.479
Nadel, Rachela.

20
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.148
- Steiner, Gertruda.
- Steiner, Hilda.

21
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.145
- Jerzy, you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

22
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.416
Let's get together,
please.

23
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.335
Smile. Good.

24
00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.493
Yes, sir.

25
00:06:10.454 --> 00:06:12.705
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

26
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:18.044
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say they are from?

27
00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:21.881
You can say
they are from me.

28
00:06:42.695 --> 00:06:43.945
From the gentleman.

29
00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.321
Where?

30
00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:52.954
Do you know him?

31
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:56.749
Find out who he is.

32
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:58.835
Yes, sir.

33
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.592
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight.

34
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:07.510
But I know you won't.

35
00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.682
You embarrass me.

36
00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:23.359
What's he doing?

37
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.905
Stay here.

38
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:33.328
How are you doing?

39
00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:36.372
You'd leave a woman alone
at the table in a place like this?

40
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.543
Sweetheart, you're
the picture of loneliness.

41
00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:46.299
What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

42
00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.843
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

43
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.053
And for the lady?

44
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.262
Pernod.

45
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.734
Come to the table, girls!
Drink with us!

46
00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.367
Come to us! Marry us!

47
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:33.054
Thank you.

48
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.472
I'll tell you what
I mean by cooperative.

49
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:36.557
Two days after
the law is passed

50
00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:38.267
that all Jews have
to wear the star,

51
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.353
the Jewish tailors are
turning them out by the gross

52
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.605
in a variety of
fabrics at three zloty each.

53
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.524
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

54
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:48.361
- I have an excellent German Riesling, 1937.
- French.

55
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.072
- A Bordeaux. Château Latour, '28, '29?
- No, I'm sorry.

56
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.117
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

57
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.661
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

58
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.579
- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

59
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:01.249
- Burgundy then? A Romanée-Conti, '37?
- Yes.

60
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:04.252
It's human nature.
We'll do this to avoid that.

61
00:09:04.503 --> 00:09:07.046
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

62
00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:09.215
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

63
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:12.927
But this storm is different. This is not
the Romans. This storm is the SS.

64
00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:45.001
Martin.

65
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.503
Yes, sir.

66
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.256
Who is that man?

67
00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:54.093
That's Oskar Schindler!

68
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.431
Rabbi...

69
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.976
- Private property cannot be confiscated.
- How long are the schools going to be closed?

70
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.143
I do not know.

71
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:28.813
- Article 47, pillage is formally prohibited.
- You don't know anything!

72
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.648
- I am familiar with the Hague Convention.
- Religious...

73
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:34.735
They come into our house
and tell us we don't live there anymore.

74
00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:37.822
It now belongs to
a certain SS officer.

75
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.449
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

76
00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:43.452
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

77
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.455
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

78
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.458
I mean, what if
I just took this thing off?

79
00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.460
What are they going
to do about it?

80
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.045
They will shoot you.

81
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.090
- Why don't you stop this silly talk?
- Itzhak Stern!

82
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.760
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

83
00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:04.223
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

84
00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:07.560
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

85
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:21.157
There's a company you did the books
for on Lipowa Street.

86
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.201
Made what?
Pots and pans?

87
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.996
By law, I have to tell you,
sir, I'm a Jew.

88
00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:31.083
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

89
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.838
A good company,
you think?

90
00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.340
Modestly successful.

91
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.343
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you?

92
00:12:40.469 --> 00:12:42.219
I was just the accountant.

93
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:45.306
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

94
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.766
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

95
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.976
You could make other things,
couldn't you?

96
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:54.023
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

97
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.070
Once the war ends, forget it,
but for now it's great.

98
00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:00.988
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

99
00:13:01.073 --> 00:13:04.116
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

100
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.078
Like what?

101
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.164
I'm sure you'll do just fine
once you get the contracts.

102
00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.124
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

103
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.711
Well, I can get the signatures I need.
That's the easy part.

104
00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.632
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

105
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.467
You don't have any money?

106
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.429
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

107
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.892
Jews, yeah. Investors.

108
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.853
You must have contacts in
the Jewish business community,

109
00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:33.938
working here.

110
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.607
What community?
Jews can no longer own businesses.

111
00:13:36.692 --> 00:13:37.984
That's why this
one's in receivership.

112
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.402
But they wouldn't own it.

113
00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:42.530
I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product, pots and pans.

114
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.198
Pots and pans.

115
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.658
Something they can use.

116
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.827
Something they can
feel in their hands.

117
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.912
They can trade it
on the black market,

118
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.998
do whatever they want.
Everybody's happy.

119
00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.919
If you want, you could run
the company for me.

120
00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.634
Let me understand.
They'd put up

121
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.053
all the money,
I'd do all the work.

122
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:09.265
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

123
00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:12.018
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

124
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.228
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

125
00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:17.148
That's what I'm good at, not the work.
Not the work.

126
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.276
The presentation.

127
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:42.882
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

128
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:47.344
Well, they should be, Itzhak Stern.

129
00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:51.140
Tell them they should be.

130
00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:25.841
I've got a client who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45-to-1.

131
00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.802
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

132
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.804
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

133
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:31.555
Wicks, for lamps.

134
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.390
You have a truckload of wicks?

135
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.768
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?

136
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.353
Nine by 12, nine by 14.

137
00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:40.022
- I don't know.
- Big, beautiful, Persian.

138
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.320
What?

139
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.280
- You don't recognize this?
- It's shoe polish.

140
00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.657
In metal containers?

141
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.075
You asked for shoe polish.

142
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.119
- In metal containers. This is glass.
- In metal containers.

143
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:54.203
It's not what I asked for.

144
00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:56.455
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

145
00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.665
What's the difference?

146
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.375
My client sold it
to his client,

147
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:01.127
who sold it to
the German army.

148
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.379
Only by the time
it got there, because

149
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.714
of the freezing cold, it broke.
All 10,000 units.

150
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:08.134
This is not my problem.

151
00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.760
- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

152
00:16:09.845 --> 00:16:11.053
This is not my problem.

153
00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.471
All right.

154
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.559
The German army wants to
find out where it came from.

155
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.561
I am going to make
sure they find out.

156
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:19.979
Now it's your problem.

157
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.398
You, be quiet!

158
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.359
Metal containers.

159
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:27.987
Hello.

160
00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.324
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

161
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.202
Nice shirt.

162
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.914
Do you know where
I can find a nice shirt like that?

163
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.257
Like this?

164
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.260
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

165
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.263
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

166
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.022
Do you have any idea
how much a shirt like this costs?

167
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:04.648
Nice things cost money.

168
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.289
How many?

169
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.960
I'm going to need some other things too,
as things come up.

170
00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.712
This won't be a problem.

171
00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.547
From time to time.

172
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.512
- Name? Adresse?
- Formular ausfüllen!

173
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:19.223
- Weiter, weiter!
- Nicht drängeln!

174
00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.976
- Kommen sie hierher!
- Stellen sie sich doch an!

175
00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.170
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing?

176
00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:39.511
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

177
00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.722
Goodbye, Jews!

178
00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.557
Goodbye, Jews!

179
00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:50.064
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

180
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.025
Goodbye, Jews!

181
00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:14.963
Oh, my God.

182
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:19.843
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

183
00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.935
Oh, my God.

184
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.069
It could not be better.

185
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.029
It could be worse.

186
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.656
How? Tell me.

187
00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:44.201
How on Earth
could it possibly be worse?

188
00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:00.926
- Hey, Goldberg.
- Poldek.

189
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.345
What's this?

190
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.764
The Judenrat has
its own police now.

191
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:06.932
You don't say.

192
00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.100
Ordnungsdienst.

193
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.437
- I'm a policeman now, could you believe it?
- It's hard to believe.

194
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:13.105
No, it's not hard to believe.

195
00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.607
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

196
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:18.777
Look, maybe I could put in a good word
for you with my superiors.

197
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.028
Your superiors?

198
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.823
Come on, they are not as bad
as everyone says.

199
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.909
Well, they're worse
than everyone says,

200
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:28.370
but it's a lot of money,
a lot of money.

201
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.415
Give me my housing assignment.

202
00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.042
Come on.

203
00:21:34.169 --> 00:21:35.669
You look funny in
that hat, Goldberg.

204
00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:40.215
You look like a clown,
you know.

205
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:49.183
He's a very important man.
Just give him two minutes of your time.

206
00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:52.686
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen.

207
00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:55.397
Please. Sir?

208
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.236
For each 1,000 you invest,
I will repay you with...

209
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.404
Two hundred.

210
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.614
Two hundred kilos of
enamelware a month,

211
00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:05.324
to begin in July and to
continue for one year.

212
00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:08.911
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

213
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.746
Not good enough.

214
00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.206
It's not good enough.

215
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.416
Not good enough?

216
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.587
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. Not good enough.

217
00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.423
A couple of months ago you'd be right.
Not anymore.

218
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.884
Money's still money.

219
00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:30.057
No, it is not.
That's why we're here.

220
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.392
Trade goods,
that's the only currency

221
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.353
that'll be worth
anything in the ghetto.

222
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.813
Things have changed,
my friend.

223
00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:41.860
Did I call this meeting?

224
00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:43.737
You told Mr. Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

225
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.656
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

226
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.785
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

227
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:54.831
Forget the whole thing.
Get out.

228
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.090
How do we know
that you will do what you say?

229
00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:05.217
Because I said I would.

230
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:07.678
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

231
00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:09.930
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

232
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:53.015
The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled
laborers is seven marks a day,

233
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.100
five for unskilled and women.

234
00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.937
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

235
00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:01.315
The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

236
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:05.986
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.

237
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.404
Are you listening?

238
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.905
What was that about the SS?

239
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.866
The rate? The what?

240
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.951
The Jewish worker's salary.
You pay it

241
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:14.661
directly to the SS,
not to the worker.

242
00:24:14.746 --> 00:24:16.496
- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

243
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:17.789
It's less than what
I would pay a Pole.

244
00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:19.124
It's less.

245
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:23.962
That's the point I'm trying to make.
Poles cost more.

246
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.508
Why should I hire Poles?

247
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.763
An enamelware factory
over at Lipowa Street.

248
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:36.308
It's owned by a German.

249
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:40.395
But it's outside the ghetto,
so you can barter for extra goods,

250
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.189
for eggs,
I don't know what you need,

251
00:24:42.315 --> 00:24:43.982
with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

252
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:47.527
Also, he's asking for
10 healthy women for the...

253
00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:48.695
I am healthy.

254
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:51.323
Bring your sister, okay?

255
00:24:58.623 --> 00:25:00.248
You need to convince
them you have a trade,

256
00:25:00.375 --> 00:25:02.000
something valuable
to the war effort.

257
00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.210
Like what?
What if you don't?

258
00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:04.461
I'm a musician.

259
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:06.088
Your name goes on a list.

260
00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:07.756
And they put you on trucks...

261
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.841
- No, no, that's not true.
- You're a musician?

262
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.093
Yeah.

263
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.427
I'd find a good
hiding place if I were you.

264
00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:14.471
I'm not going to
hide like some animal.

265
00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:16.598
There are places to hide.

266
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.274
I'm a graduate of
the University of Lviv.

267
00:25:27.652 --> 00:25:30.362
I used to work at the hydroelectric
station in Rożnów.

268
00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:31.780
Blauschein.

269
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:37.661
I'm gonna get
the necessary papers

270
00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:39.538
because this card
is no good anymore.

271
00:25:39.622 --> 00:25:42.416
You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

272
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.253
They are no good.
You'll have to leave the line now,

273
00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.505
then you'll get
a blue card, a Blauschein,

274
00:25:48.631 --> 00:25:50.841
to say that you are
an essential worker.

275
00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:53.844
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

276
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.637
Pharmacist.
Just there, look.

277
00:25:56.764 --> 00:25:57.931
Guess who is here?

278
00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.809
Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

279
00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:02.269
Enjoying the lines?

280
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:03.729
Need some shoe polish?

281
00:26:03.813 --> 00:26:05.856
In a metal container maybe?

282
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:10.902
Not essential? I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

283
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.157
No Blauschein, sir.
Stand over there. Move. Next!

284
00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:19.494
What do you mean?
Not essential?

285
00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:24.624
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

286
00:26:30.047 --> 00:26:32.507
He's a metal polisher.

287
00:26:39.974 --> 00:26:41.183
It was not right?

288
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.601
It's very good.
He's 53 years old.

289
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:44.102
It's too new.

290
00:26:44.228 --> 00:26:45.687
Thank you.

291
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.781
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.

292
00:26:55.907 --> 00:26:57.949
How many times
have I told you?

293
00:26:58.576 --> 00:27:01.495
Your work certificate
you keep in your pocket at all times.

294
00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:05.040
And you leave yours in your drawer.
How many times I've told you?

295
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:08.585
I'm a metal polisher.

296
00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:23.892
Take the round sheet of tin,
dip it in soap emulsion,

297
00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:28.647
then place it
centrally in the press.

298
00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:48.041
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot.

299
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.293
Soup pot.

300
00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:53.922
Grosz, Mrs. Grosz,
stay together.

301
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:01.763
Sir,
I have 10 work permits here

302
00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:04.516
for the Deutsche
Emailwarenfabrik

303
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.102
cosigned by Mr. Bankier
and myself.

304
00:28:07.687 --> 00:28:11.773
If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.

305
00:28:12.817 --> 00:28:16.486
But don't touch both the electrodes
at the same time.

306
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:20.073
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

307
00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:26.955
Roll the metal
under the press,

308
00:28:27.081 --> 00:28:29.499
but be very careful
unless you want your fingers

309
00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:31.418
to become part of the teapot.

310
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.755
Occupation?

311
00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:37.549
I'm a writer.
I play the flute.

312
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.177
But Moses is
a skilled metalworker.

313
00:28:41.262 --> 00:28:43.221
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

314
00:28:43.347 --> 00:28:45.348
He can make whatever
Mr. Schindler asks.

315
00:28:45.433 --> 00:28:49.811
He's highly skilled. Give him your card.
Moses, give him your card.

316
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:56.902
Now, dip the basin with the tongs
into the enamel solution.

317
00:28:59.614 --> 00:29:03.825
And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip dry.

318
00:29:07.163 --> 00:29:08.997
And whatever he asks you,
allow me

319
00:29:09.123 --> 00:29:10.957
just to represent
you and speak for you.

320
00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:12.500
Don't say a word.

321
00:29:13.002 --> 00:29:16.338
Filing, billing, keeping track of
my appointments, shorthand.

322
00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:18.465
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?

323
00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:20.592
All right.

324
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.135
Please.

325
00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:17.774
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

326
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.988
I don't know how.
They're all so qualified.

327
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.408
You have to choose.

328
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:31.746
Big smile. Big smile.

329
00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:55.854
If you would,
look after my guest.

330
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.650
Boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté,

331
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.612
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar.

332
00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:06.364
- Yes.
- And, of course,

333
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.532
who could live
without German cigarettes?

334
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.242
Get me as many
as you can find.

335
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.202
And some more fresh fruit.

336
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.622
The real rarities,
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

337
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.208
I need several boxes
of Cuban cigars. The best.

338
00:31:17.293 --> 00:31:19.627
- Yes.
- And dark, unsweetened chocolate.

339
00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:21.629
Not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

340
00:31:21.714 --> 00:31:23.715
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

341
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.799
Yes.

342
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:28.136
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.

343
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.515
Dom Pérignon champagne.
Get L'Espadon sardines,

344
00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:36.227
and, oh, try to find
nylon stockings.

345
00:31:39.774 --> 00:31:42.609
It is my distinct
pleasure to announce

346
00:31:42.693 --> 00:31:48.406
the fully operational status
of Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik.

347
00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:52.786
Manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery,

348
00:31:53.704 --> 00:31:57.749
expressly designed
and crafted for military use.

349
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:01.377
Utilizing only
the most modern equipment,

350
00:32:01.462 --> 00:32:03.880
D.E.F.'s staff of
highly skilled and

351
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:06.299
experienced
artisans and journeymen

352
00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:09.344
deliver a product of
unparalleled quality,

353
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:14.224
enabling me to proffer,
with absolute confidence and pride,

354
00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:16.768
a full line of
field and kitchenware

355
00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:19.854
unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.

356
00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:23.358
See attached list
and available colors.

357
00:32:25.194 --> 00:32:28.196
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval

358
00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:32.325
and looking forward to a long
and mutually prosperous association,

359
00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:35.912
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude

360
00:32:35.996 --> 00:32:38.873
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

361
00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:42.252
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

362
00:32:42.336 --> 00:32:44.963
Nine hundred,
no, make it 10 for Wednesday.

363
00:32:45.047 --> 00:32:46.881
All this stuff here
goes to Madritsch's

364
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.842
factory on
Tuesday of next week.

365
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:08.403
My father was fond of saying,
you need three things in life,

366
00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:14.284
a good doctor, a forgiving priest,
and a clever accountant.

367
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:23.126
The first two,
I've never had much use for.

368
00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:25.545
But the third...

369
00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:35.221
Just pretend,
for Christ's sake.

370
00:33:39.768 --> 00:33:41.644
Is that all?

371
00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:50.570
I'm trying to thank you.
I'm saying

372
00:33:50.696 --> 00:33:53.615
I couldn't have
done this without you.

373
00:33:57.828 --> 00:34:00.371
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

374
00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:02.957
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

375
00:34:05.628 --> 00:34:07.670
You're welcome.

376
00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.640
Get out of here.

377
00:34:32.613 --> 00:34:34.155
Klonowska, who is it?

378
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:48.002
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

379
00:35:00.182 --> 00:35:02.183
You know something?
You would like her.

380
00:35:02.268 --> 00:35:04.269
- Oskar, please.
- What?

381
00:35:04.395 --> 00:35:06.604
- I don't have to like her just because you do.
- You would though.

382
00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:08.815
It doesn't work that way.

383
00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.747
You've done well here.

384
00:35:27.376 --> 00:35:29.711
You look wonderful.

385
00:35:33.007 --> 00:35:34.590
Be careful of the step, miss.

386
00:35:34.717 --> 00:35:36.342
Mrs. Schindler, Marek.

387
00:35:49.732 --> 00:35:51.149
It's not a charade, all this?

388
00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:52.692
How could it be a charade?

389
00:35:52.776 --> 00:35:54.110
The clothes,
the car, the apartment.

390
00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:55.611
Wait a minute.

391
00:35:55.696 --> 00:35:58.573
Take a guess how many people
are on my payroll.

392
00:35:58.657 --> 00:35:59.782
Oskar.

393
00:36:00.117 --> 00:36:04.454
My father, at the height of his success,
had 50. I've got 350.

394
00:36:04.538 --> 00:36:06.748
Three hundred
and fifty workers

395
00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:09.083
on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

396
00:36:10.336 --> 00:36:11.961
To make pots and pans?

397
00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:14.964
To make money. For me.

398
00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:24.724
Does anyone ask about me?

399
00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:29.854
Back home? Everybody.

400
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.106
All the time.

401
00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:41.449
They won't soon forget the name Schindler
here, I can tell you that.

402
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:45.787
Oskar Schindler,
they'll say.

403
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.123
Everybody remembers him.

404
00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:53.795
He did something
extraordinary.

405
00:36:55.464 --> 00:36:58.299
He did something
no one else did.

406
00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:02.845
He came here
with nothing,

407
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.973
a suitcase,

408
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:10.436
and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory.

409
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.233
And left with
a steamer trunk.

410
00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:18.653
Two steamer
trunks full of money.

411
00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:23.324
All the riches
of the world.

412
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.789
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

413
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:32.583
You're wrong, Emilie.

414
00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:36.754
There's no way I could have
known this before,

415
00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:39.173
but there was
always something missing.

416
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:43.803
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

417
00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:46.139
Something was missing.

418
00:37:46.807 --> 00:37:50.268
Even if I'd known what it was,
there's nothing I could have done about it,

419
00:37:50.352 --> 00:37:53.729
because you can't
create this thing.

420
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.026
And it makes all the difference in the world
between success and failure.

421
00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:02.488
Luck?

422
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.534
War.

423
00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.394
Should I stay?

424
00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:38.816
It's a beautiful city.

425
00:38:40.569 --> 00:38:42.904
I asked you if I should stay.

426
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:47.909
It's up to you.

427
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:56.959
Promise me, Oskar, no doorman
or maître d' will ever presume

428
00:38:57.044 --> 00:39:00.796
I'm anyone other than Mrs. Schindler,
and I'll stay.

429
00:39:04.426 --> 00:39:05.927
Goodbye, darling.

430
00:39:23.445 --> 00:39:27.448
I could try to read this, or I could
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

431
00:39:28.075 --> 00:39:29.450
We're doing well?

432
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:30.993
- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

433
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:32.036
Yes.

434
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.538
Any reason to think
next month will be worse?

435
00:39:33.622 --> 00:39:35.248
The war could end.

436
00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:47.969
What?

437
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.178
There is a machinist outside

438
00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:52.223
who'd like to thank you personally
for giving him a job.

439
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:56.477
Every day he comes. He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

440
00:40:03.527 --> 00:40:05.528
Mr. Lowenstein?

441
00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:18.624
I want to thank you, sir,
for giving me the opportunity to work.

442
00:40:18.709 --> 00:40:21.210
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

443
00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:25.840
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me,

444
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:30.761
but I am essential
to the war effort, thanks to you.

445
00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:32.430
That's great.

446
00:40:32.973 --> 00:40:34.849
I work hard for you.

447
00:40:35.517 --> 00:40:37.310
I'm sure you do.

448
00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:39.270
I'll continue to
work hard for you.

449
00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:41.564
That's great. Thanks.

450
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:42.773
God bless you, sir.

451
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.025
All right.

452
00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:46.152
You are a good man.

453
00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:50.990
He saved my life.

454
00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:52.199
Yes, he did.

455
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:54.035
God bless him.

456
00:40:54.202 --> 00:40:55.328
Yeah. Come on.

457
00:40:57.998 --> 00:41:00.041
God bless you.

458
00:41:12.554 --> 00:41:15.264
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

459
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:18.142
This is for
the Obersturmbannführer, sir.

460
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:21.437
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.

461
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:23.356
Greta as in Garbo.

462
00:41:23.482 --> 00:41:25.316
By the way, don't
ever do that to me again.

463
00:41:25.567 --> 00:41:27.151
Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

464
00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:29.153
Did you happen to notice that
that man had one arm?

465
00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:30.237
Did he?

466
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.993
What's his use?

467
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.244
Very useful.

468
00:41:40.374 --> 00:41:41.582
How?

469
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.000
Very useful! Success!

470
00:42:12.823 --> 00:42:15.116
Besen und Schaufeln
werden ausgeladen

471
00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:17.451
jeder nimmt sich eine und dann
wird die straße gereinigt.

472
00:42:17.828 --> 00:42:19.704
We'll be late for work.

473
00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:35.052
You shouldn't
think of them as yours, Oskar.

474
00:42:35.387 --> 00:42:37.471
You need to understand that
some of the officers here

475
00:42:37.556 --> 00:42:39.473
don't give a damn
about production.

476
00:42:40.642 --> 00:42:43.352
To them, it's
a matter of national priority

477
00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:46.188
that Jews be
made to shovel snow.

478
00:42:47.149 --> 00:42:50.985
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar.
You know it and I know it.

479
00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:56.907
Jews shoveling snow,
it's got a ritual significance.

480
00:43:00.537 --> 00:43:02.204
Come with me.

481
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.998
I am an essential worker.

482
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:05.082
Essential worker?

483
00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:06.250
Yes.

484
00:43:09.671 --> 00:43:11.505
I work for Oskar Schindler.

485
00:43:11.673 --> 00:43:13.507
Essential worker
for Oskar Schindler.

486
00:43:13.592 --> 00:43:14.884
A one-armed Jew?
Twice as useless!

487
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.343
Yes, yes.

488
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:20.431
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

489
00:43:20.682 --> 00:43:22.933
I work for Oskar Schindler.

490
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.855
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

491
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.863
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

492
00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:39.033
File a grievance with
the Economic Office. It's your right.

493
00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:40.201
Would it do any good?

494
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:42.369
Of course not.

495
00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:48.167
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office came to lunch,

496
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:52.797
and he told us that to believe
the Jewish skilled worker had a place

497
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:56.133
in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

498
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:05.351
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

499
00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:07.812
He was a metal press operator.

500
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:14.068
Quite skilled.

501
00:44:44.266 --> 00:44:45.432
Herr Direktor?

502
00:44:46.268 --> 00:44:48.394
Shit. I don't believe it.

503
00:44:48.562 --> 00:44:50.688
Stern, is that you?

504
00:44:51.106 --> 00:44:54.441
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

505
00:44:55.277 --> 00:44:58.279
Leave your luggage on the platform.

506
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:04.493
Clearly label it. Given name first,
then your surname.

507
00:45:05.245 --> 00:45:07.621
Do not bring
your baggage with you.

508
00:45:07.873 --> 00:45:10.249
It will follow you later.

509
00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:16.130
Leave your luggage on the platform.
Clearly label it.

510
00:45:21.303 --> 00:45:22.678
Stern?

511
00:45:25.557 --> 00:45:26.682
He's on the list.

512
00:45:26.808 --> 00:45:27.975
He is?

513
00:45:28.852 --> 00:45:30.144
Well, let's find him.

514
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.520
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.

515
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:34.899
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker he would not be on the list.

516
00:45:34.983 --> 00:45:37.151
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

517
00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:38.819
Sir, the list is correct.

518
00:45:38.987 --> 00:45:40.446
I didn't ask you
about the list.

519
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.697
I asked you your name.

520
00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:42.990
Klaus Tauber.

521
00:45:45.327 --> 00:45:46.619
Tauber.

522
00:45:46.703 --> 00:45:50.706
Hauptscharführer, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

523
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.125
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

524
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:55.586
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production

525
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.671
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

526
00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:03.928
- Is he on the list?
- Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

527
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:09.350
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

528
00:46:10.852 --> 00:46:12.144
What is your name?

529
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.562
Close and secure all doors.

530
00:46:13.647 --> 00:46:16.982
My name?
My name is Kunder.

531
00:46:17.484 --> 00:46:19.109
- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

532
00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:21.111
- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

533
00:46:21.196 --> 00:46:23.489
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

534
00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:26.116
Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

535
00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:28.661
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be

536
00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:31.956
in Southern Russia before
the end of the month. Good day.

537
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:37.419
Stern!

538
00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:40.089
- Stern!
- Stern!

539
00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:41.548
Itzhak Stern!

540
00:46:48.807 --> 00:46:50.557
Stern! Itzhak Stern!

541
00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:52.059
Stern! Stern!

542
00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:53.477
Itzhak Stern!

543
00:46:55.063 --> 00:46:56.146
Stern!

544
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.398
Sir?

545
00:47:00.527 --> 00:47:02.528
- Stern!
- Herr Direktor.

546
00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:05.489
My apologies.

547
00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:08.492
- Stop the train! He's here!
- I apologize.

548
00:47:08.785 --> 00:47:10.744
Stop the train!

549
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.788
Stop the train! Stop it!

550
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.095
Sign here.
Initial there.

551
00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:34.268
Makes no difference to us, you understand.
This one, that one.

552
00:47:34.936 --> 00:47:37.021
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

553
00:47:37.105 --> 00:47:38.814
It's the paperwork.

554
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.691
I somehow left my
work card at home.

555
00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:43.944
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

556
00:47:44.821 --> 00:47:46.780
I'm sorry,
it was stupid!

557
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:48.824
What if I got here
five minutes later?

558
00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:51.410
Then where would I be?

559
00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:45.482
I woke up from
a dream this morning.

560
00:49:45.567 --> 00:49:49.653
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,

561
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:52.447
only to discover
I was broke and sharing

562
00:49:52.574 --> 00:49:55.325
a room with 12 people
I didn't know.

563
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.035
You laugh about it?

564
00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.370
I have to laugh.

565
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:01.165
You are living behind walls.

566
00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:06.170
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

567
00:50:06.254 --> 00:50:09.339
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

568
00:50:09.424 --> 00:50:12.259
I like it here.
There's a kind of, I don't know,

569
00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:14.720
ancestral squalor to it all.

570
00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.930
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us anymore.

571
00:50:17.015 --> 00:50:18.015
I'm smart.

572
00:50:18.141 --> 00:50:19.183
Oh, yes, you're smart.

573
00:50:19.267 --> 00:50:20.267
You're a real genius.

574
00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:21.476
You had your chance.

575
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:25.939
Today, today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

576
00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:29.443
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

577
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.278
When's the last
time we did this?

578
00:50:31.362 --> 00:50:33.572
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

579
00:50:33.823 --> 00:50:36.450
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

580
00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:39.203
No one took my
business away from me.

581
00:50:39.579 --> 00:50:41.413
You don't really
have a business to take.

582
00:50:41.915 --> 00:50:43.790
There's nowhere
down from here.

583
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:45.834
This is it.
This is the bottom.

584
00:50:46.586 --> 00:50:49.129
The ghetto is liberty.

585
00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:59.640
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

586
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:07.481
Right side, Ghetto A, civil employees,
industrial workers, and so on.

587
00:51:08.858 --> 00:51:12.069
Left side, Ghetto B,
surplus labor,

588
00:51:12.195 --> 00:51:15.447
the elderly and infirm,
mostly.

589
00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:18.492
Which is where you
will want to start.

590
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.911
Do you have
any questions, sir?

591
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:23.789
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

592
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:29.127
We expect a labor
force of 25,000 to 30,000.

593
00:51:29.212 --> 00:51:32.756
Segregated, of course.
The men in the barracks near the quarry.

594
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.299
The women on
the other side of the wire.

595
00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:36.468
- My place is where?
- There, sir.

596
00:51:36.552 --> 00:51:38.345
- There?
- Yes, the villa.

597
00:51:38.429 --> 00:51:39.846
You call that a villa?

598
00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:41.056
Their synagogue,
can you see it?

599
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:42.307
That's not a villa.

600
00:51:42.392 --> 00:51:44.059
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.

601
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:45.143
It's a house.

602
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.604
What's that over there?

603
00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:51.984
Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.

604
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:56.571
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

605
00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:01.535
There they are, sir.

606
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:10.252
One of you is
a very lucky girl.

607
00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:15.716
There is an opening
for a job away from all

608
00:52:16.509 --> 00:52:20.012
this backbreaking
work at my new villa.

609
00:52:25.977 --> 00:52:29.062
Which of you has
domestic experience?

610
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:36.778
Ja, on second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid.

611
00:52:36.863 --> 00:52:40.073
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

612
00:52:45.246 --> 00:52:47.914
I don't want
to give you my cold.

613
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.083
What's your name?

614
00:52:50.877 --> 00:52:52.586
- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

615
00:52:53.046 --> 00:52:54.963
Helen Hirsch.

616
00:52:55.048 --> 00:52:56.840
What? I can't hear.

617
00:52:56.966 --> 00:52:58.759
Helen Hirsch.

618
00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:15.942
Ja.

619
00:53:16.027 --> 00:53:17.361
Take it all down!

620
00:53:17.445 --> 00:53:19.571
To work!

621
00:53:21.657 --> 00:53:24.368
Take it down!
It is not safe!

622
00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:27.496
She says the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.

623
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.540
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

624
00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:34.419
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

625
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:38.423
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation

626
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.968
has to be torn
down and re-poured.

627
00:53:42.053 --> 00:53:44.763
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence

628
00:53:44.889 --> 00:53:47.599
at the southern
end of the barracks.

629
00:53:48.267 --> 00:53:50.977
Subsidence, and then collapse.

630
00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:53.063
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes.

631
00:53:53.898 --> 00:53:55.315
My name is Diana Reiter.

632
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.819
I'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the University of Milan.

633
00:53:58.903 --> 00:54:02.489
An educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

634
00:54:10.832 --> 00:54:12.624
- Unterscharführer!
- Jawohl?

635
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.585
Shoot her.

636
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:16.878
What?

637
00:54:18.673 --> 00:54:22.926
Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.

638
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.553
Ja, I'm doing mine.

639
00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:26.972
But, sir, she's
foreman of construction.

640
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:29.766
We are not going to have arguments
with these people.

641
00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:30.976
Okay.

642
00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:36.606
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

643
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:49.619
It will take more than that.

644
00:54:49.704 --> 00:54:51.037
I'm sure you're right.

645
00:54:59.297 --> 00:55:03.633
Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it.
Like she said.

646
00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:07.929
We have more to see,
but we have only one more hour of light.

647
00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:21.443
Today is history.

648
00:55:23.321 --> 00:55:25.906
Today will be remembered.

649
00:55:27.742 --> 00:55:33.371
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder about this day.

650
00:55:35.416 --> 00:55:37.792
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

651
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:43.131
Six hundred years ago,

652
00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:45.717
when elsewhere they
were footing the blame

653
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:48.261
for the Black Death,
Kazimierz the Great...

654
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:55.185
so-called, told the Jews
they could come to Krakow.

655
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.228
They came.

656
00:55:56.312 --> 00:55:58.104
Not that fat. No, less.

657
00:55:58.231 --> 00:56:00.023
They trundled their
belongings into the city.

658
00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:01.107
Yes, a bit less.

659
00:56:01.275 --> 00:56:02.317
They settled.

660
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:05.403
They took hold.

661
00:56:05.488 --> 00:56:11.034
They prospered in business,
science, education, the arts.

662
00:56:12.954 --> 00:56:14.704
They came here with nothing.

663
00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:17.958
Nothing.

664
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:20.752
And they flourished.

665
00:56:22.296 --> 00:56:26.841
For six centuries there has been
a Jewish Krakow.

666
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:29.803
Think about that.

667
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.264
By this evening,

668
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:35.892
those six
centuries are a rumor.

669
00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:39.521
They never happened.

670
00:56:41.649 --> 00:56:43.316
Today is history.

671
00:57:04.547 --> 00:57:07.173
Absitzen und in
zweierreihen antreten!

672
00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:10.427
Kameraden! Schneller!

673
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:18.143
I think we will start
with Ghetto B.

674
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:29.112
All right?

675
00:57:29.238 --> 00:57:30.322
Start from both sides?

676
00:57:30.406 --> 00:57:32.282
- No, no, I would like you to start there.
- The right side?

677
00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:33.533
The right side, yeah.
And then move around.

678
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:34.868
All right.

679
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:20.807
Gold, Chaim!

680
00:59:20.933 --> 00:59:22.392
Platz Chodi.

681
00:59:23.144 --> 00:59:24.310
Gold, Chaim!

682
00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:25.687
Yes, Chaim Gold.

683
00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:27.397
Shoot him.

684
00:59:41.287 --> 00:59:43.997
Keine koffer! Keine koffer!

685
00:59:44.165 --> 00:59:45.373
Gehen sie durch!

686
00:59:45.499 --> 00:59:47.834
Keine koffer! Keine koffer!

687
00:59:48.252 --> 00:59:50.462
Hey, little boy.
Wie alt bist du, he?

688
00:59:50.546 --> 00:59:53.673
Na, wie heißt du?
Wie heißt du, eh?

689
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.468
Keine koffer, hab ich gesagt!

690
00:59:57.762 --> 00:59:59.596
Packt keine koffer!
Keine koffer!

691
01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:02.891
Rüber zum Platz Chodi!
Koffer hier lassen!

692
01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.643
- Blauschein.
- Platz Chodi!

693
01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:07.854
Was soll der koffer hier?

694
01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:10.190
Alles rüber zum Platz Chodi!

695
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.000
We're getting out
through the sewers.

696
01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.794
I have to check
if they're clear.

697
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.422
Mila, pack some things.
Nothing bigger than this.

698
01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:37.509
I can't go in the sewers.
I told you I won't go in the sewers.

699
01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:44.390
You can go. Yes, you can.

700
01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.020
I won't go in the sewers.

701
01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.868
Move! Over there!
Over there! Move!

702
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:06.746
Your card, Jew!

703
01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:11.125
Deine Papiere, Jude!

704
01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.129
That line.

705
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.632
Deine karte!

706
01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:20.760
Ich geh nicht rauf wegen
deiner verdammten karte!

707
01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.138
Deine scheißkarte!

708
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.869
Was soll denn die scheiße?
Bist du denn verrückt geworden?

709
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.329
Mit diesem scheißgewehr
hättest du mich erschießen können!

710
01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.040
Du hast so nah an mir
vorbeigeschossen!

711
01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.543
Was heißt hier entschuldigung.
Du bist wohl verrückt geworden!

712
01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.044
Zurückbleiben!
Zurückbleiben!

713
01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.970
Nicht sprechen, nicht sprechen!
Einfach zu den lastwagen gehen!

714
01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:07.390
Weiterlaufen! Weiterlaufen!
Nicht sprechen!

715
01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.798
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

716
01:03:21.882 --> 01:03:25.259
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

717
01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:34.686
You can join her
or join the line.

718
01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:40.942
Women to the left!

719
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.068
- Wilhelm!
- Rose!

720
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.988
Men to right.
Women to the left.

721
01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.280
Women to the left.

722
01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:47.657
Let me go!
I won't leave my husband!

723
01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.957
- Women to the left, and men to the right.
- Promise me, be safe.

724
01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:00.837
Your government is
in the wrong country!

725
01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.262
Mama! Mama!

726
01:04:57.436 --> 01:04:59.020
Mila!

727
01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.097
You have a Blauschein.

728
01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:35.640
Blauschein
doesn't matter anymore,

729
01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.266
they are cleaning out
the ghetto.

730
01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:38.893
There is not
enough room for you.

731
01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:40.603
What are you talking about?
We tried it

732
01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.355
before, there's
more than enough room.

733
01:05:42.815 --> 01:05:44.023
I changed my mind!

734
01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.399
Mama!

735
01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.902
Oh, look at
the space in there.

736
01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:50.279
Now look at me.
You are just scared.

737
01:05:50.364 --> 01:05:52.448
I can fit the girl,
but not you.

738
01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:53.616
Mama, I'm coming out!

739
01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:54.826
Stay where you are.

740
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.161
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

741
01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:58.538
Mama!

742
01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:22.145
Herr Kommandant!

743
01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:23.729
Very good saluting.

744
01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:25.731
I respectfully report
I've been given orders

745
01:06:25.858 --> 01:06:27.775
to clear the bundles
from the road,

746
01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:30.903
so there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

747
01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:35.533
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

748
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.349
Mrs. Dresner?

749
01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:01.767
Yes.

750
01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:04.353
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

751
01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:07.023
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

752
01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:09.275
No, get under the stairs.
They'll be done

753
01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.569
searching soon.
You'll be safe there.

754
01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.196
Please hide. Please.

755
01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.366
Hide under the stairs.

756
01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:22.997
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

757
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.634
- Danka!
- Mama!

758
01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:42.099
Hello, Adam.

759
01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.978
Hello, Danka.

760
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.403
Come with me. I will
put you in the good line.

761
01:07:57.241 --> 01:08:00.409
Do you know the saying,
an hour of life is still life?

762
01:08:00.494 --> 01:08:04.580
You are not a boy anymore.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

763
01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:45.097
Oh, please, let's go.
Let's go, please.

764
01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:47.683
Come on.

765
01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.546
Markieren. Markieren.

766
01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.430
- Was ist das? Ist das Bach?
- Nein, nein. Mozart.

767
01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:33.182
- Mozart?
- Ja.

768
01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:54.828
Das wollen wir
heute noch schaffen?

769
01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:55.955
Nee, schaffen wir nie.

770
01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.629
Nee, schaffen wir nie.

771
01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.881
I wish this fucking night
were over.

772
01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:03.397
Mützen ab!

773
01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:07.192
Namen verlesen!

774
01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:11.488
Wer aufgerufen wird, hebt seine
hand und ein deutliches jawohl!

775
01:14:11.573 --> 01:14:13.365
Jawohl.

776
01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:19.538
- Keller, Fanni!
- Jawohl.

777
01:14:20.874 --> 01:14:24.335
- Adalbert, Hermann!
- Jawohl.

778
01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:27.212
- Faber, Dorothea!
- Jawohl.

779
01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.715
- Goldstein, Pola!
- Jawohl.

780
01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:34.094
- Warmberger, Markus!
- Jawohl.

781
01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.806
Edelstein, Max!

782
01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:58.577
Appell abtreten!

783
01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:03.957
The worst is over.
We are workers now.

784
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.959
Oh, God, Amon.

785
01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:49.897
Amon, you're such
a damned fucking child!

786
01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:52.065
Wakey, wakey.

787
01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:03.285
Make coffee.

788
01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:04.953
Make it yourself.

789
01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:23.222
The SS will manage
certain industries itself

790
01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.140
inside Plaszow.

791
01:17:25.225 --> 01:17:27.643
A metalworks, brush factory,

792
01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:29.895
another for reprocessing
Jewish clothing

793
01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:33.774
from the ghettos for use by
bombed-out families back home.

794
01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:37.402
But it's private industry like yours
that stands to benefit most

795
01:17:37.487 --> 01:17:39.613
by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

796
01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:42.324
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

797
01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.826
Good to see you, my friend.

798
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:45.911
- Oskar Schindler.
- Leo John.

799
01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.251
Franz, good to see you.

800
01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:53.502
Hello, Oskar.
Glad you could join us.

801
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.128
My pleasure. Julius.

802
01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:56.839
How are you?
You lost weight.

803
01:17:56.923 --> 01:17:59.925
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

804
01:18:01.386 --> 01:18:04.012
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

805
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.266
We started without you.

806
01:18:07.392 --> 01:18:08.934
Fine.
I miss anything good?

807
01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:12.187
I was explaining to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch

808
01:18:12.272 --> 01:18:15.357
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

809
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.276
I meant the food.

810
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.197
Since your labor
is housed on-site,

811
01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.283
it's available to you
at all times.

812
01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.035
You can work them
all night if you want.

813
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.329
Your factory policies,
whatever they've

814
01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.707
been in the past,
they'll continue to be.

815
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.458
They'll be respected.

816
01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:35.836
I have to know,
where do you get a suit

817
01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:37.796
like that?
What is that? Is that silk?

818
01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:39.298
Of course.

819
01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:41.466
Ja.

820
01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.469
It has a nice sheen about it.

821
01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:45.554
Thank you.

822
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.722
Very nice.

823
01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:50.142
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man
who made it is probably dead.

824
01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.977
I don't know.

825
01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:55.230
I go to work the other day.

826
01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.650
Nobody's there.

827
01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:02.362
Nobody tells me about this.
I have to find out. I have to go in.

828
01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.157
Everybody's gone.

829
01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.826
No.

830
01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.245
No.

831
01:19:14.042 --> 01:19:16.501
They're not gone.
They're here.

832
01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:21.924
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

833
01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:23.675
Every worker that is shot
costs me money.

834
01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.385
I have to find somebody else.
I have to train them.

835
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.929
We are going to be
making so much money

836
01:19:27.055 --> 01:19:28.513
that none of this
is going to matter.

837
01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.724
It's bad business.

838
01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:45.030
Thank you.

839
01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.990
Leave the bottle.

840
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:50.494
Take that.

841
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.373
Lena, thank you.

842
01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:07.219
Scherner told me
something else about you.

843
01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:11.765
Yeah? What's that?

844
01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:16.395
That you know the meaning
of the word gratitude.

845
01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:20.232
That it's not some
vague thing with you

846
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:22.818
like it is with others.

847
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:26.405
You want to
stay where you are.

848
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.741
You've got things
going on the side.

849
01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:32.577
Things are good.

850
01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:36.081
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

851
01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:41.378
I can understand all that, you know.
I know you.

852
01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:48.677
What you want is
your own sub-camp.

853
01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.686
Do you have any idea what is involved?
The paperwork alone,

854
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.229
and then you've got to
build the fucking thing.

855
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.982
Getting the fucking permits is
enough to drive you crazy.

856
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.191
Then the engineers show up,

857
01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:06.028
they stand around, they argue
about drainage, foundations,

858
01:21:06.112 --> 01:21:07.821
codes, exact specifications,

859
01:21:07.905 --> 01:21:09.698
parallel fences
four kilometers long,

860
01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:12.242
1,200 kilograms
of barbed wire,

861
01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:15.037
6,000 kilograms of electrified fences,
ceramic insulators,

862
01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:16.872
three cubic meters of
air space per prisoner.

863
01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:19.041
I'm telling you, you want to shoot somebody.
I've been through it.

864
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.709
You know? I know.

865
01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:23.545
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

866
01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.634
You could make
things easier for me.

867
01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:34.639
I'd be grateful.

868
01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:12.135
Where's Stern?

869
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:19.893
Goldberg and Chilowicz,
make sure I see my cut

870
01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:23.355
from the factory owners
in this camp.

871
01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:26.858
Leaving you to take
care of my main account,

872
01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:29.486
the Schindler account.

873
01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:34.491
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

874
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:36.493
But independence costs money.

875
01:22:37.537 --> 01:22:39.788
This, you understand?

876
01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:45.710
Look at me.

877
01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.559
Don't forget who you
are working for now.

878
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.864
Make sure he stays.
He's a slippery bastard!

879
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.497
We need more wine.

880
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:23.790
More wine!

881
01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:26.418
Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.

882
01:23:49.984 --> 01:23:51.276
Thank you, Herr Direktor.

883
01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:52.652
Prost, Herr Direktor!

884
01:23:57.909 --> 01:23:59.618
What are you doing?

885
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.536
What?
Scratching my head.

886
01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:04.831
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps make them keep their distance.

887
01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:07.292
Do you have lice?

888
01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.460
Do you have your notebook?

889
01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:10.420
The calendar on my desk
has the birthdays

890
01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.380
of our SS friends'
wives and children.

891
01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:13.882
Don't forget to
send something.

892
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.426
Record payoffs to
the Main Administration

893
01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:18.011
and Economics Office,
the Arm...

894
01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:19.804
Slowly, Stern, slowly.

895
01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:22.891
The Armaments Board,
Governor General's Division of the Interior

896
01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.393
and Chief of Police as fees.

897
01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:27.646
And make them on
the first of each month,

898
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:30.232
as opposed to individual payoffs
to our SS contacts.

899
01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:32.234
The list is in the lower drawer
of my desk, which you...

900
01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:34.319
First of month...

901
01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.948
SS contacts list, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle

902
01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:40.283
as cash contributions
to legitimate charities

903
01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.619
sent, of course,
to each official's office.

904
01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.996
Dealings with our
black market contacts

905
01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.415
listed as suppliers in
the legitimate ledger

906
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.334
- are more complicated.
- Forget it.

907
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.253
What do you mean, forget it?
You can't forget it.

908
01:24:51.337 --> 01:24:53.421
It gives me a headache.
It gives me a headache!

909
01:25:00.513 --> 01:25:02.055
I couldn't get you
out of here.

910
01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:03.765
I'll be all right.

911
01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:08.603
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

912
01:25:08.688 --> 01:25:11.398
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

913
01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:17.279
Here, put these
in your pocket.

914
01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.114
Come on.

915
01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.370
Herr Direktor,
don't let things fall apart.

916
01:25:25.454 --> 01:25:27.205
I've worked too hard.

917
01:25:36.215 --> 01:25:39.843
Thanks for... Good luck.

918
01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.355
What are you making?

919
01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:34.856
Hinges, sir.

920
01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.278
I've got some
workers coming in tomorrow.

921
01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:42.072
Where the hell
they from again?

922
01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:44.240
Yugoslavia,
Herr Kommandant.

923
01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:46.451
I've got to make room.

924
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.580
Make me a hinge.

925
01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.207
Yes, sir.

926
01:27:24.532 --> 01:27:26.449
Keep going, you're doing well.

927
01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.877
Oh, that's very good.

928
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:42.465
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

929
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:46.261
What I don't understand
is that you've been working

930
01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:50.181
since I think, what,
about 6:00 this morning?

931
01:27:51.392 --> 01:27:55.603
Yet, such a small pile
of hinges.

932
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.801
Oh, Christ.

933
01:28:26.886 --> 01:28:27.969
May I try that, sir?

934
01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.305
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

935
01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:33.516
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.

936
01:28:33.601 --> 01:28:35.852
Maybe it's the pin.
Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.

937
01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:37.061
Ja, come on.

938
01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.313
What did I just say?
Here.

939
01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:43.735
Herr Kommandant.

940
01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:49.574
I beg to report that my heap of hinges
was so unsatisfactory

941
01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:53.244
because the machines were being
recalibrated this morning.

942
01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:58.249
I was put on to
shoveling coal.

943
01:29:22.191 --> 01:29:23.733
Strange, huh?

944
01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:25.693
Yeah.

945
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:32.534
Thank you, Muek.

946
01:29:34.453 --> 01:29:38.081
Lisiek, don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

947
01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:39.791
- Rottenführer.
- Oh, for me?

948
01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.501
Oh, thank you very much,
Herr Direktor.

949
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:42.961
Herr Direktor!

950
01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:45.797
Herr Direktor!

951
01:29:48.968 --> 01:29:50.426
Herr Direktor.

952
01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:54.722
He was making
hinges slowly.

953
01:29:54.807 --> 01:29:56.724
So the man can
turn out a hinge in

954
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.810
less than a minute.
Why the long story?

955
01:30:28.674 --> 01:30:30.049
Thank you, sir.

956
01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:31.551
You're welcome.

957
01:30:35.139 --> 01:30:37.932
Nobody knows who
stole the chicken, hmm?

958
01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:39.100
Tell him about the chicken.

959
01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:42.687
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

960
01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.356
Save yourselves.

961
01:30:46.567 --> 01:30:48.359
Tell him about the chicken.

962
01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.544
Still nobody knows.

963
01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:21.976
It was you.
You committed this crime.

964
01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:23.186
No, sir.

965
01:31:23.312 --> 01:31:24.437
But you know who though.

966
01:31:24.521 --> 01:31:26.356
- Yes.
- Who?

967
01:31:28.067 --> 01:31:30.026
Him!

968
01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.782
He's very gifted.

969
01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:37.742
Yeah, sure.
Bring him over.

970
01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:44.165
Sir. Thank you.

971
01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.506
Thank you again,
Herr Direktor.

972
01:31:51.632 --> 01:31:53.007
You're welcome again.

973
01:31:53.092 --> 01:31:55.593
It's an honor to work
for such a great company.

974
01:31:55.678 --> 01:31:56.678
It's great to have you.

975
01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:59.764
I promise to learn everything there is
to know about enamelware production.

976
01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:01.057
That's great.

977
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:17.407
- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

978
01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:19.992
She wants to speak to
the Herr Direktor.

979
01:32:40.806 --> 01:32:42.140
Yes.

980
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.730
He won't see you.

981
01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.387
Please, sit down.

982
01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.100
Pernod? Cognac?

983
01:33:26.226 --> 01:33:27.602
No. No, thank you.

984
01:33:28.854 --> 01:33:31.522
So, what can I do for you?

985
01:33:36.737 --> 01:33:39.280
They say that
no one dies here.

986
01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.491
They say your
factory is a haven.

987
01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:46.454
They say you are good.

988
01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:50.792
Who says that?

989
01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:53.377
Everyone.

990
01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:03.054
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

991
01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:06.557
I've been living in Krakow on false papers
since the ghetto massacre.

992
01:34:06.642 --> 01:34:08.601
My parents are in Plaszow.

993
01:34:08.685 --> 01:34:12.980
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

994
01:34:13.065 --> 01:34:16.692
They are older people.
They are killing older people now in Plaszow.

995
01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:20.071
They bury them up
in the forest. Look...

996
01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:23.783
I don't have any money.

997
01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:26.786
I borrowed these clothes.

998
01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:32.750
I'm begging you. Please.

999
01:34:33.919 --> 01:34:35.461
Please bring them here.

1000
01:34:35.546 --> 01:34:38.130
I don't do that.

1001
01:34:38.215 --> 01:34:41.926
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.

1002
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.845
Whether or not
the worker has certain skills.

1003
01:34:43.929 --> 01:34:45.388
That's what I ask
and that's what I care about.

1004
01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:47.890
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1005
01:34:47.975 --> 01:34:51.435
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

1006
01:34:53.063 --> 01:34:57.108
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God!

1007
01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:09.203
People die.
It's a fact of life.

1008
01:35:09.288 --> 01:35:11.038
He wants to kill everybody?
Great!

1009
01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:12.957
What am I supposed to do
about it?

1010
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:15.793
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1011
01:35:15.878 --> 01:35:18.713
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

1012
01:35:18.797 --> 01:35:22.675
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.

1013
01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.844
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1014
01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:27.763
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans

1015
01:35:27.848 --> 01:35:30.975
and people with no
skills whatsoever!

1016
01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.980
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

1017
01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:39.525
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

1018
01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:40.776
Are you losing money?

1019
01:35:40.903 --> 01:35:42.069
That's not the point!

1020
01:35:42.154 --> 01:35:44.113
So the point is?

1021
01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.198
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!

1022
01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:53.998
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.

1023
01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.709
You have to think of it
in his situation.

1024
01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:00.338
He's got this
whole place to run.

1025
01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:03.257
He's responsible for everything here,
all these people.

1026
01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:05.426
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

1027
01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:10.681
And he's got the war
which brings out the worst in people.

1028
01:36:10.766 --> 01:36:14.644
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

1029
01:36:16.355 --> 01:36:21.275
But in normal circumstances
he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

1030
01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.403
There'd just be the good aspects
of him, which...

1031
01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:28.324
He's a wonderful crook.

1032
01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:32.703
A man who loves good food, good wine,
the ladies, making money...

1033
01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:34.288
Killing.

1034
01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.124
He can't enjoy it.

1035
01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:41.629
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped

1036
01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.965
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1037
01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.135
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

1038
01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:51.973
He shot the man to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right of him.

1039
01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:55.226
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

1040
01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.566
Twenty-five.

1041
01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:09.073
What do you want
me to do about it?

1042
01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.616
Nothing, nothing.

1043
01:37:11.493 --> 01:37:13.703
We're just talking.

1044
01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:27.216
Perlman.

1045
01:37:29.261 --> 01:37:30.928
Perlman!

1046
01:37:32.097 --> 01:37:33.764
Husband and wife.

1047
01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:37.643
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

1048
01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:52.867
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1049
01:38:49.508 --> 01:38:52.843
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1050
01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:57.431
Herr Direktor, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something

1051
01:38:57.516 --> 01:39:00.267
to clean the stains from
the Herr Kommandant's bathtub.

1052
01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:01.685
Go clean it.

1053
01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.187
Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

1054
01:39:07.526 --> 01:39:10.694
You don't have to
report to me, Helen.

1055
01:39:10.779 --> 01:39:13.447
You know who I am?

1056
01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:23.082
I'm Schindler.

1057
01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:27.670
Of course.
I have heard, and

1058
01:39:28.922 --> 01:39:31.549
you have been here before.

1059
01:39:33.844 --> 01:39:36.387
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

1060
01:39:36.763 --> 01:39:38.389
Go on, take it.

1061
01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:40.099
I get extra food here.

1062
01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:44.687
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.

1063
01:39:47.566 --> 01:39:49.775
Why not build yourself up?

1064
01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:58.450
My first day here,
he beat me

1065
01:39:58.535 --> 01:40:02.329
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

1066
01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:10.171
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

1067
01:40:10.255 --> 01:40:12.756
He asked me where they were.

1068
01:40:15.594 --> 01:40:19.221
For his dogs,
you understand.

1069
01:40:22.309 --> 01:40:26.228
I said to him,
I don't know how I say this.

1070
01:40:26.313 --> 01:40:30.065
I never could say it now,
I said to him...

1071
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:32.401
Why are you beating me?

1072
01:40:35.989 --> 01:40:39.575
He said, the reason
I beat you now

1073
01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:43.287
is because you ask
why I beat you.

1074
01:40:45.332 --> 01:40:47.333
I know your
sufferings, Helen.

1075
01:40:50.754 --> 01:40:52.254
It doesn't matter.

1076
01:40:54.883 --> 01:40:56.967
I have accepted them.

1077
01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.595
Accepted them?

1078
01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:03.724
One day he will shoot me.

1079
01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:06.685
No, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1080
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:09.521
I know. I see things.

1081
01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.734
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,

1082
01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:17.321
and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the front door

1083
01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:23.244
and down the steps by the patio,
right there below us,

1084
01:41:23.328 --> 01:41:28.082
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he

1085
01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:31.001
shot a woman who
was passing by.

1086
01:41:32.379 --> 01:41:35.631
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1087
01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:39.385
Just a woman on her way somewhere,
you know?

1088
01:41:39.469 --> 01:41:43.097
She was no fatter or thinner

1089
01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:45.766
or slower or faster
than anyone else,

1090
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:50.020
and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1091
01:41:54.526 --> 01:41:57.695
The more you see of
the Herr Kommandant,

1092
01:41:57.779 --> 01:42:03.367
the more you see there is
no set rules that you can live by.

1093
01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:08.163
You can't say to yourself,
if I follow these rules, I will be safe.

1094
01:42:11.835 --> 01:42:15.838
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you too much.

1095
01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.467
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you wear the star.

1096
01:42:20.552 --> 01:42:22.136
He doesn't want
anyone else to know

1097
01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:24.930
it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1098
01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.186
He shot the woman
from the steps

1099
01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:34.982
because she meant
nothing to him.

1100
01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:37.818
She was one of a series,

1101
01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:40.571
neither offending
or pleasing him.

1102
01:42:44.534 --> 01:42:46.744
But you, Helen.

1103
01:42:51.124 --> 01:42:55.586
It's all right.
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1104
01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.010
Thank you.

1105
01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:10.017
Here.

1106
01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.983
Right. The wine.

1107
01:43:25.617 --> 01:43:28.494
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1108
01:43:37.087 --> 01:43:40.047
Why do you drink
that motor oil?

1109
01:43:40.131 --> 01:43:43.300
I send you good stuff
all the time.

1110
01:43:43.385 --> 01:43:47.179
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1111
01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:49.640
You know, I look at you.

1112
01:43:50.183 --> 01:43:52.351
I watch you.

1113
01:43:55.021 --> 01:43:56.355
You're never drunk.

1114
01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.524
Oh, that's...

1115
01:44:00.443 --> 01:44:02.361
That's real control.

1116
01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:05.823
Control is power.

1117
01:44:06.783 --> 01:44:08.951
That's power.

1118
01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:15.457
Is that why they fear us?

1119
01:44:18.253 --> 01:44:21.964
We have the fucking power to kill,
that's why they fear us.

1120
01:44:22.048 --> 01:44:25.843
They fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1121
01:44:25.927 --> 01:44:27.845
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1122
01:44:27.929 --> 01:44:30.848
We have him killed,
and we feel pretty good about it.

1123
01:44:30.932 --> 01:44:33.892
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1124
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.938
That's not power though.

1125
01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:42.443
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1126
01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:50.367
Power is when we have
every justification to kill,

1127
01:44:51.703 --> 01:44:52.870
and we don't.

1128
01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:55.873
You think that's power?

1129
01:44:58.877 --> 01:45:02.087
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,

1130
01:45:02.172 --> 01:45:03.672
he's brought in
before the emperor,

1131
01:45:03.756 --> 01:45:08.010
he throws himself down on the ground,
he begs for mercy.

1132
01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:10.471
He knows he's going to die.

1133
01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:16.977
And the emperor pardons him.

1134
01:45:18.313 --> 01:45:21.440
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1135
01:45:25.111 --> 01:45:26.862
I think you are drunk.

1136
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:30.699
That's power, Amon.

1137
01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:35.245
That is power.

1138
01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:45.923
Amon the Good.

1139
01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:52.095
I pardon you.

1140
01:45:59.229 --> 01:46:00.187
What do they want?

1141
01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:03.815
I don't know, but they're in my office
right now reviewing our books.

1142
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:08.028
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed that the auditors

1143
01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:09.738
- are reviewing my books?
- Well...

1144
01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:11.281
Or have you done
your job properly?

1145
01:46:11.407 --> 01:46:12.824
You needn't be alarmed.

1146
01:46:12.909 --> 01:46:14.660
I needn't be alarmed.

1147
01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.374
I'm sorry, sir.

1148
01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:22.543
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1149
01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:24.628
Do you know how
much it costs?

1150
01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:31.301
All right.

1151
01:46:33.596 --> 01:46:34.972
All right.

1152
01:46:38.977 --> 01:46:41.144
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1153
01:47:29.235 --> 01:47:30.819
She was smoking
on the job.

1154
01:47:34.907 --> 01:47:36.742
Tell her not to do it again.

1155
01:47:53.176 --> 01:47:54.718
I have to report, sir.

1156
01:47:56.763 --> 01:47:59.640
I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1157
01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.146
What are you using, Lisiek?

1158
01:48:06.272 --> 01:48:08.065
Soap, Commandant.

1159
01:48:10.318 --> 01:48:12.194
Soap? Not lye?

1160
01:48:22.246 --> 01:48:26.041
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1161
01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:50.107
I pardon you.

1162
01:50:42.178 --> 01:50:45.806
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances

1163
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:48.600
I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me

1164
01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:51.269
if I intone the blessings.

1165
01:51:44.115 --> 01:51:45.824
So...

1166
01:51:47.410 --> 01:51:50.495
This is where you
come to hide from me.

1167
01:51:51.372 --> 01:51:53.164
I came to tell you

1168
01:51:54.876 --> 01:51:58.253
that you really
are a wonderful cook

1169
01:51:58.337 --> 01:52:01.548
and a well-trained servant.

1170
01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:06.094
I mean it. If you need
a reference after the war,

1171
01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:10.599
I'd be happy to give you one.

1172
01:52:11.893 --> 01:52:13.560
It must get lonely down here

1173
01:52:13.644 --> 01:52:18.064
when you're listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time.

1174
01:52:25.072 --> 01:52:26.323
Does it?

1175
01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:31.161
You can answer.

1176
01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:37.125
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking.

1177
01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.837
What does he want to hear?

1178
01:52:46.218 --> 01:52:50.221
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1179
01:52:53.142 --> 01:52:55.602
Yes, you're right.

1180
01:52:55.686 --> 01:52:57.520
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1181
01:52:59.357 --> 01:53:01.274
Yes. I...

1182
01:53:03.361 --> 01:53:04.694
I mean,

1183
01:53:12.453 --> 01:53:14.412
I would like so much to

1184
01:53:16.248 --> 01:53:19.709
reach out and touch
you in your loneliness.

1185
01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.089
What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1186
01:53:25.257 --> 01:53:28.051
What would be wrong with that?

1187
01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:31.846
I realize that
you're not a person in

1188
01:53:31.931 --> 01:53:34.766
the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1189
01:53:36.435 --> 01:53:38.353
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know,

1190
01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:42.023
maybe what's wrong isn't...

1191
01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:44.818
It's not us.

1192
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:48.321
It's... No, it's this.

1193
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:53.660
I mean,
when they compare you to

1194
01:53:55.413 --> 01:53:58.581
vermin, and to rodents,
and to lice...

1195
01:54:02.044 --> 01:54:03.294
I just...

1196
01:54:07.049 --> 01:54:09.968
No, you make a good point.

1197
01:54:10.052 --> 01:54:12.554
You make a very good point.

1198
01:54:20.938 --> 01:54:23.398
Is this the face of a rat?

1199
01:54:26.444 --> 01:54:29.112
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1200
01:54:32.074 --> 01:54:34.617
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1201
01:54:50.426 --> 01:54:53.887
I feel for you, Helen.

1202
01:55:11.155 --> 01:55:13.156
No, I don't think so.

1203
01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:17.619
You're a Jewish bitch.

1204
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:22.957
You nearly talked me
into it, didn't you?

1205
01:55:23.042 --> 01:55:24.209
Didn't you?

1206
01:55:29.548 --> 01:55:30.673
Bravo.

1207
01:55:53.864 --> 01:55:55.240
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1208
01:56:06.335 --> 01:56:08.837
On behalf of the workers, sir,

1209
01:56:08.921 --> 01:56:12.340
I wish for you
a happy birthday.

1210
01:56:12.716 --> 01:56:14.300
Happy birthday.

1211
01:56:14.385 --> 01:56:16.052
Well, the staff, please.

1212
01:56:16.178 --> 01:56:19.848
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1213
01:56:38.576 --> 01:56:41.995
Thank you very much.
Tell them thank you from me.

1214
01:56:58.304 --> 01:57:02.891
The trains arrived and
the people were driven out with clubs.

1215
01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:06.978
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1216
01:57:07.062 --> 01:57:11.024
One was marked Cloak Room,
and the other Valuables.

1217
01:57:11.108 --> 01:57:13.693
And there they were made
to undress.

1218
01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:18.323
A Jewish boy handed them pieces of string
to tie their shoes together.

1219
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:21.159
They shaved their hair.

1220
01:57:21.243 --> 01:57:23.077
They told them
it was needed to

1221
01:57:23.204 --> 01:57:25.079
make something
special for U-boat crews.

1222
01:57:26.624 --> 01:57:30.460
And then they were herded
down a big corridor

1223
01:57:30.544 --> 01:57:34.589
to bunkers with Stars
of David on the doors

1224
01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:38.718
and signs that said
Bath and Inhalation Room.

1225
01:57:38.802 --> 01:57:40.762
SS gave them soap.

1226
01:57:40.846 --> 01:57:43.264
They told them to breathe
all the time

1227
01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:45.808
because it's good
for disinfecting.

1228
01:57:47.019 --> 01:57:48.937
And then they gassed them.

1229
01:57:50.314 --> 01:57:52.649
Mila, why soaps?

1230
01:57:53.651 --> 01:57:55.151
So that they would
agree to go in, I think.

1231
01:57:55.236 --> 01:57:59.239
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your bedtime
stories are scaring everyone.

1232
01:57:59.323 --> 01:58:02.325
Yeah. You know
it's ridiculous.

1233
01:58:02.409 --> 01:58:04.077
I cannot believe it.

1234
01:58:04.161 --> 01:58:06.579
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.

1235
01:58:06.664 --> 01:58:07.747
From who?

1236
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:10.041
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1237
01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:13.586
You know,
if they were there,

1238
01:58:13.671 --> 01:58:15.421
they would
have been gassed.

1239
01:58:15.506 --> 01:58:16.923
Yes.

1240
01:58:17.049 --> 01:58:18.466
It doesn't make any sense.

1241
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:20.635
We're their workforce.

1242
01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:24.597
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?

1243
01:58:24.682 --> 01:58:29.519
To go to all this trouble of assembling
a workforce only to...

1244
01:58:29.937 --> 01:58:31.396
No, it can't be true.

1245
01:58:33.148 --> 01:58:36.276
We are very,
very important for them.

1246
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:39.445
Yeah, we do now.
Good night.

1247
01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:40.863
Good night.

1248
01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:42.407
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

1249
01:58:51.667 --> 01:58:54.127
Attention, attention.

1250
01:58:54.211 --> 01:58:56.838
Everyone who is alive

1251
01:58:56.922 --> 01:58:59.090
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1252
01:59:00.426 --> 01:59:01.968
Attention, attention.

1253
01:59:02.094 --> 01:59:03.636
We have to go to
the Appellplatz.

1254
01:59:03.721 --> 01:59:04.804
Everyone who is alive...

1255
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:06.014
The list makers are here.

1256
01:59:06.098 --> 01:59:07.557
...is to come to the Appellplatz.

1257
01:59:07.725 --> 01:59:09.142
There is going to be
a selection.

1258
01:59:09.226 --> 01:59:13.855
Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive

1259
01:59:13.939 --> 01:59:16.691
is to come to the Appellplatz.

1260
01:59:32.249 --> 01:59:33.541
Meine Herren.

1261
01:59:46.347 --> 01:59:48.514
You could afford to
lose some weight, Amon.

1262
01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:52.852
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1263
01:59:52.936 --> 01:59:55.605
Morning.
What's going on?

1264
01:59:56.357 --> 01:59:59.192
It's another
semi-annual physical.

1265
02:00:00.694 --> 02:00:01.819
There.

1266
02:00:01.904 --> 02:00:05.531
Oh, I've got another
shipment coming in of...

1267
02:00:05.616 --> 02:00:07.950
What are they this time?

1268
02:00:08.035 --> 02:00:09.786
- Hungarians.
- Ja, Hungarians.

1269
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:13.456
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1270
02:00:49.952 --> 02:00:51.494
Let me help you.

1271
02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:56.833
Zack, zack, zack!

1272
02:01:03.507 --> 02:01:05.842
We've got to go out there.

1273
02:01:09.847 --> 02:01:11.180
Don't go.

1274
02:01:12.349 --> 02:01:14.308
Look alive, Rebeka.

1275
02:01:37.166 --> 02:01:39.500
That's my mechanic.

1276
02:01:39.585 --> 02:01:42.253
Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1277
02:02:46.068 --> 02:02:48.611
No, no, no.
Wait, go away. She can work.

1278
02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:52.698
Come here. Look, separate
the sick from the healthy.

1279
02:02:52.783 --> 02:02:55.493
Those who can work and those
who can't. She can work.

1280
02:02:55.577 --> 02:02:57.662
You can work, you can come.

1281
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:29.962
Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

1282
02:04:30.047 --> 02:04:32.048
Go back to the barracks.

1283
02:04:32.174 --> 02:04:34.133
Return to the barracks.

1284
02:04:41.016 --> 02:04:42.850
Go back to the barracks.

1285
02:04:46.897 --> 02:04:48.230
Oh, my God!

1286
02:05:11.338 --> 02:05:12.963
Olek? Olek?

1287
02:05:13.090 --> 02:05:14.757
Danka?

1288
02:05:14.841 --> 02:05:16.759
Olek? Olek?

1289
02:05:19.429 --> 02:05:23.015
Olek! Olek!

1290
02:05:31.316 --> 02:05:32.316
Olek?

1291
02:05:32.442 --> 02:05:33.484
Danka?

1292
02:05:33.568 --> 02:05:35.403
- Danka?
- Olek?

1293
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:40.324
I didn't see him!

1294
02:05:40.409 --> 02:05:42.451
They're hiding.
I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1295
02:05:42.536 --> 02:05:46.872
I know Danka. She knows a good place.
She took all of them together.

1296
02:06:08.812 --> 02:06:13.941
Find your own hiding place. There's no room
for you here. Go away, quick!

1297
02:06:37.758 --> 02:06:40.926
Get out.
This is our place. Get out!

1298
02:07:04.367 --> 02:07:05.951
Oskar!

1299
02:07:06.077 --> 02:07:07.661
Amon. Gentlemen.

1300
02:07:07.746 --> 02:07:09.413
Why didn't you call me?

1301
02:07:09.539 --> 02:07:11.165
I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.

1302
02:07:11.291 --> 02:07:13.334
Quite a picnic, huh?
Madritsch. Oskar.

1303
02:07:13.418 --> 02:07:15.044
They're running a little late,
you know?

1304
02:07:15.212 --> 02:07:16.796
It's taking longer
than I thought.

1305
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.339
A drink?

1306
02:07:18.465 --> 02:07:19.882
Something cold. Bowle.

1307
02:07:19.966 --> 02:07:21.300
The Bowle.

1308
02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.806
Oh, another beautiful day.

1309
02:08:00.131 --> 02:08:01.298
Oh, thank you.

1310
02:08:07.055 --> 02:08:09.265
What do you say
we get your fire hoses out

1311
02:08:09.432 --> 02:08:11.684
here and hose down the cars?
Thank you.

1312
02:08:14.354 --> 02:08:16.939
Indulge me.

1313
02:08:19.276 --> 02:08:20.943
- Hujar.
- Yes, sir.

1314
02:08:21.361 --> 02:08:22.903
Go bring the fire hoses.

1315
02:08:23.029 --> 02:08:24.613
Where's the fire?

1316
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:31.662
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1317
02:08:31.746 --> 02:08:35.708
On the roof. That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.

1318
02:08:39.087 --> 02:08:41.547
Come on. Come on.

1319
02:08:42.924 --> 02:08:44.800
That's it, more, more.

1320
02:08:49.264 --> 02:08:53.142
That's it, that's it.
More, more.

1321
02:08:53.226 --> 02:08:56.604
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1322
02:08:56.688 --> 02:09:00.858
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!

1323
02:09:00.942 --> 02:09:04.153
Come on, try and reach
the far end. Look out.

1324
02:09:04.237 --> 02:09:06.822
Water! More water!

1325
02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.287
I've got some 200-meter hoses
back in Emalia.

1326
02:09:13.371 --> 02:09:15.247
I have 20 meters at home
in my garden.

1327
02:09:15.332 --> 02:09:17.541
We can reach
the cars at the end.

1328
02:09:17.626 --> 02:09:20.169
What? What?

1329
02:09:24.674 --> 02:09:25.674
Hujar.

1330
02:09:25.842 --> 02:09:26.842
Yeah, sure.

1331
02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:48.072
Don't forget the roof.

1332
02:09:48.156 --> 02:09:50.157
On the roof
on the other side.

1333
02:09:57.874 --> 02:10:00.960
Scharführer,
every time the train stops...

1334
02:10:01.044 --> 02:10:03.796
- You open the doors, you give them water, yeah?
- Jawohl.

1335
02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:05.714
This car! This car!

1336
02:10:30.615 --> 02:10:33.742
I'm not saying you'll regret it,
but you might.

1337
02:10:33.827 --> 02:10:35.577
You should be aware of that.

1338
02:10:35.662 --> 02:10:37.830
We will have to risk regret.

1339
02:10:38.665 --> 02:10:41.917
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1340
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:19.788
What about you?

1341
02:11:20.707 --> 02:11:23.125
I violated the
Race and Resettlement Act.

1342
02:11:24.252 --> 02:11:28.130
Though I doubt anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1343
02:11:28.465 --> 02:11:30.299
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1344
02:11:36.014 --> 02:11:38.015
Did your prick fall off?

1345
02:11:56.993 --> 02:11:58.494
He likes women.

1346
02:12:01.498 --> 02:12:03.665
He likes good-looking women.

1347
02:12:05.835 --> 02:12:09.004
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1348
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:13.050
I mean...

1349
02:12:13.134 --> 02:12:15.052
He has so many women.

1350
02:12:15.136 --> 02:12:17.012
And they love him.

1351
02:12:18.056 --> 02:12:20.849
Ja, they love him.
I mean, he is married, ja, but he's...

1352
02:12:22.685 --> 02:12:26.271
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1353
02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:29.108
But you didn't see this girl.

1354
02:12:30.193 --> 02:12:32.694
I saw this girl.
This girl was...

1355
02:12:33.696 --> 02:12:35.614
She was very good-looking.

1356
02:12:40.203 --> 02:12:42.621
They cast a spell on you,
you know, the Jews.

1357
02:12:42.705 --> 02:12:44.790
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1358
02:12:44.874 --> 02:12:46.792
They have this power.
It's like a virus.

1359
02:12:46.876 --> 02:12:48.794
Some of my men are
infected with this virus.

1360
02:12:48.878 --> 02:12:51.213
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1361
02:12:51.297 --> 02:12:54.216
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1362
02:12:54.342 --> 02:12:56.885
It's a matter of money?

1363
02:12:58.221 --> 02:13:00.180
You're offering me a bribe?

1364
02:13:02.142 --> 02:13:06.603
A bribe? No.
No, please. It's a gratuity.

1365
02:13:07.730 --> 02:13:09.022
Heil Hitler!

1366
02:13:13.570 --> 02:13:14.820
Hello, Amon.

1367
02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:20.409
Sit down.

1368
02:13:23.371 --> 02:13:26.832
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1369
02:13:27.041 --> 02:13:28.959
You should kiss us, not them.

1370
02:13:29.752 --> 02:13:32.963
God forbid you ever get
a real taste for Jewish skirt.

1371
02:13:33.423 --> 02:13:36.466
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1372
02:13:37.677 --> 02:13:40.429
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1373
02:13:41.764 --> 02:13:43.307
It's policy now.

1374
02:13:46.769 --> 02:13:48.520
Ja, schön gefangen! Gut!

1375
02:13:56.029 --> 02:13:59.114
Nochmal, ja! Schön!

1376
02:14:31.773 --> 02:14:34.983
- Schneller hier!
- Zack, zack, zack!

1377
02:15:34.085 --> 02:15:35.669
Can you believe this?

1378
02:15:36.087 --> 02:15:39.423
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1379
02:15:39.507 --> 02:15:43.302
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1380
02:15:44.887 --> 02:15:46.305
The party's over, Oskar.
They're closing

1381
02:15:46.431 --> 02:15:47.848
us down, sending
everybody to Auschwitz.

1382
02:15:47.932 --> 02:15:48.932
When?

1383
02:15:49.017 --> 02:15:50.851
I don't know. As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1384
02:15:50.935 --> 02:15:54.688
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1385
02:16:15.626 --> 02:16:16.918
I've been talking to Goeth.

1386
02:16:17.045 --> 02:16:18.337
I know the destination.

1387
02:16:18.421 --> 02:16:20.630
These are
the evacuation orders.

1388
02:16:21.215 --> 02:16:24.176
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1389
02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:26.595
That's not
what I was going to say.

1390
02:16:27.472 --> 02:16:30.849
I made Goeth promise me
he'll put in a good word for you.

1391
02:16:31.392 --> 02:16:33.018
Nothing bad is going
to happen to you there.

1392
02:16:33.144 --> 02:16:34.770
You'll receive
special treatment.

1393
02:16:34.896 --> 02:16:36.563
The directives
coming in from Berlin

1394
02:16:36.647 --> 02:16:38.732
mention special treatment
more and more often.

1395
02:16:38.816 --> 02:16:40.817
I'd like to think
that's not what you mean.

1396
02:16:40.943 --> 02:16:42.569
Preferential treatment,
all right?

1397
02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:44.946
Do we have to invent
a whole new language?

1398
02:16:45.615 --> 02:16:46.615
I think so.

1399
02:16:50.453 --> 02:16:52.162
You're staying, I take it.

1400
02:16:56.376 --> 02:16:58.293
In Krakow?
What on Earth for?

1401
02:16:58.419 --> 02:17:00.295
What for? You have
a business to run.

1402
02:17:02.632 --> 02:17:04.716
Of course, you'll have to hire
new workers. Poles, I guess.

1403
02:17:04.801 --> 02:17:07.052
They cost a little more, but...

1404
02:17:09.972 --> 02:17:11.681
What are you going to do?

1405
02:17:15.645 --> 02:17:17.562
You ran my business.

1406
02:17:21.484 --> 02:17:23.318
No, I'm going home.

1407
02:17:23.569 --> 02:17:25.028
I've done what
I came here for.

1408
02:17:25.113 --> 02:17:28.657
I've got more money
than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1409
02:17:39.919 --> 02:17:44.673
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

1410
02:17:49.095 --> 02:17:51.555
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1411
02:17:55.852 --> 02:17:57.978
I think I better have it now.

1412
02:19:34.909 --> 02:19:38.870
I don't understand.
You want these people?

1413
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:41.498
These people?
My people, I want my people.

1414
02:19:41.582 --> 02:19:44.584
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1415
02:19:44.669 --> 02:19:46.253
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1416
02:19:46.337 --> 02:19:47.420
It's good business.

1417
02:19:47.505 --> 02:19:49.548
It's good business
in your opinion.

1418
02:19:49.632 --> 02:19:52.717
Look, you've got to move them,
the equipment,

1419
02:19:52.802 --> 02:19:54.219
everything to
Czechoslovakia.

1420
02:19:54.303 --> 02:19:57.597
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1421
02:19:57.682 --> 02:20:01.059
- Look, Amon, it's good for me.
- You're not telling me something.

1422
02:20:01.143 --> 02:20:03.103
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1423
02:20:03.187 --> 02:20:04.396
You're not telling me
something.

1424
02:20:04.522 --> 02:20:05.730
It's good for you.
I'll compensate you.

1425
02:20:05.815 --> 02:20:07.566
- That's right.
- It's good for the army.

1426
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:08.942
Yeah, of course.

1427
02:20:08.985 --> 02:20:11.152
- You know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1428
02:20:11.487 --> 02:20:13.321
- Artillery shells.
- Everyone's making artillery shells.

1429
02:20:13.406 --> 02:20:15.115
- Tank shells, they need that.
- Tanks shells, ja.

1430
02:20:15.199 --> 02:20:18.034
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy, except me.

1431
02:20:18.119 --> 02:20:20.996
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1432
02:20:21.414 --> 02:20:24.416
If I'm making 100,
you've got to be making 300.

1433
02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:27.961
And if you admit to 300,
then it's 400 actually. But how?

1434
02:20:28.045 --> 02:20:29.379
I just told you.

1435
02:20:29.505 --> 02:20:30.880
You did, but you didn't.

1436
02:20:33.843 --> 02:20:35.844
Ja, all right,
don't tell me.

1437
02:20:36.095 --> 02:20:40.265
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1438
02:20:40.474 --> 02:20:44.185
Look, all you have to do
is tell me what it's worth to you.

1439
02:20:45.438 --> 02:20:47.939
- What's a person worth to you?
- No, no, no, no.

1440
02:20:48.024 --> 02:20:50.150
What's one worth to you?

1441
02:20:58.826 --> 02:21:02.370
Poldek Pfefferberg.
Mila Pfefferberg.

1442
02:21:03.205 --> 02:21:04.289
And...

1443
02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:08.585
Stagel, Stagel...

1444
02:21:08.669 --> 02:21:10.128
- Paul.
- Paul Stagel.

1445
02:21:10.504 --> 02:21:11.588
Doctor.

1446
02:21:13.966 --> 02:21:17.719
- The investors. I want all of them.
- Yes, sir.

1447
02:21:18.763 --> 02:21:20.388
Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1448
02:21:20.514 --> 02:21:23.391
Fischer, Ismail.

1449
02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:25.727
Josef Scharf.

1450
02:21:25.853 --> 02:21:27.520
One moment, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

1451
02:21:27.647 --> 02:21:29.105
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1452
02:21:32.735 --> 02:21:34.903
The children.
All the children.

1453
02:21:40.409 --> 02:21:42.410
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1454
02:21:42.912 --> 02:21:44.496
How many?

1455
02:21:44.622 --> 02:21:46.247
Four hundred, 450.

1456
02:21:49.418 --> 02:21:50.752
More, more.

1457
02:22:15.611 --> 02:22:18.905
- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1458
02:22:25.121 --> 02:22:29.374
Feigenbaum, Lutek, Jakob...
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1459
02:22:29.458 --> 02:22:31.209
Nacha, that's right.

1460
02:22:31.627 --> 02:22:32.627
And Wolf.

1461
02:22:33.796 --> 02:22:35.046
How many?

1462
02:22:37.591 --> 02:22:40.260
- 600.
- More.

1463
02:22:42.763 --> 02:22:44.180
You can do the same thing
I'm doing.

1464
02:22:44.306 --> 02:22:45.724
You might even
make money at it.

1465
02:22:45.808 --> 02:22:46.808
I don't know.

1466
02:22:46.892 --> 02:22:49.602
Come on, Julius, I know about
the extra food and clothes you give them.

1467
02:22:49.687 --> 02:22:51.438
Paid for out
of your own pocket.

1468
02:22:51.522 --> 02:22:53.106
If we make a combined
approach, we could

1469
02:22:53.232 --> 02:22:54.816
get more than 4,000 out,
mine and yours.

1470
02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:55.900
Oskar...

1471
02:22:55.985 --> 02:22:59.446
We could relocate them
in something like safety, in Moravia.

1472
02:23:00.197 --> 02:23:01.322
I don't know.

1473
02:23:03.909 --> 02:23:05.952
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1474
02:23:06.454 --> 02:23:07.495
Too many.

1475
02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.749
For every one you smoke,
I smoke half.

1476
02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:14.753
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1477
02:23:14.837 --> 02:23:16.504
No, Oskar,
I can't do any more.

1478
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:18.256
I will not accept that.

1479
02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:19.799
No.

1480
02:23:29.852 --> 02:23:31.227
How many? How many?

1481
02:23:31.353 --> 02:23:32.729
850, give or take.

1482
02:23:32.813 --> 02:23:36.191
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1483
02:23:47.328 --> 02:23:50.288
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1484
02:23:55.586 --> 02:23:59.297
What did Goeth say
about this?

1485
02:23:59.381 --> 02:24:02.717
You just told him how many people
you needed and...

1486
02:24:06.305 --> 02:24:08.264
You're not buying them.

1487
02:24:11.352 --> 02:24:14.437
You're buying them? You're paying him
for each of these names?

1488
02:24:14.522 --> 02:24:15.939
If you were still working
for me,

1489
02:24:16.065 --> 02:24:17.482
I'd expect you to talk me
out of it.

1490
02:24:17.566 --> 02:24:19.400
It's costing me a fortune.

1491
02:24:21.779 --> 02:24:25.031
Finish the page and leave one
space at the bottom.

1492
02:24:47.346 --> 02:24:48.596
You...

1493
02:24:55.312 --> 02:24:57.772
The list is
an absolute good.

1494
02:24:59.733 --> 02:25:02.151
The list is life.

1495
02:25:04.196 --> 02:25:07.740
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1496
02:25:09.451 --> 02:25:11.452
Oskar,
there's a clerical error here

1497
02:25:11.579 --> 02:25:13.538
at the bottom
of the last page.

1498
02:25:13.622 --> 02:25:16.040
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1499
02:25:16.125 --> 02:25:18.793
I'll never find a maid
as well trained as her at Brinnlitz.

1500
02:25:18.878 --> 02:25:20.378
They are all country girls.

1501
02:25:22.006 --> 02:25:23.089
No.

1502
02:25:32.766 --> 02:25:33.850
No.

1503
02:25:34.685 --> 02:25:35.685
One hand of 21.

1504
02:25:35.811 --> 02:25:36.853
No.

1505
02:25:36.937 --> 02:25:39.731
- If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
- No.

1506
02:25:39.815 --> 02:25:42.650
- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No.

1507
02:25:43.736 --> 02:25:45.778
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1508
02:25:47.239 --> 02:25:48.573
I can't wager Helen
in a card game.

1509
02:25:48.699 --> 02:25:50.074
Why not?

1510
02:25:50.159 --> 02:25:51.326
Wouldn't be right.

1511
02:25:51.410 --> 02:25:53.161
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two anyway.

1512
02:25:53.245 --> 02:25:55.121
What difference does it make?
She's not going to Auschwitz.

1513
02:25:55.205 --> 02:25:57.498
I'd never do that to her.
No, I want her

1514
02:25:57.625 --> 02:25:59.918
to come back to Vienna
with me.

1515
02:26:00.002 --> 02:26:02.962
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1516
02:26:03.172 --> 02:26:04.505
I want to grow old with her.

1517
02:26:04.632 --> 02:26:05.965
Are you mad?

1518
02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:11.095
Amon, you can't take her
to Vienna with you.

1519
02:26:11.513 --> 02:26:13.264
No, of course I can't.

1520
02:26:14.183 --> 02:26:16.059
That's what I'd like to do.

1521
02:26:16.977 --> 02:26:19.729
What I can do,
if I'm any sort of a man,

1522
02:26:19.855 --> 02:26:22.649
is the next most
merciful thing.

1523
02:26:22.733 --> 02:26:25.109
I shall take her
into the woods and

1524
02:26:25.235 --> 02:26:27.654
shoot her painlessly
in the back of the head.

1525
02:26:37.331 --> 02:26:40.708
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1526
02:26:41.794 --> 02:26:44.379
Was it 14,800?

1527
02:26:44.546 --> 02:26:47.215
Schindlerjuden to these tables!
Say your names clearly.

1528
02:26:47.299 --> 02:26:49.759
We are the family Dresner.

1529
02:26:49.885 --> 02:26:52.387
Juda, Jonas,
Donata and Chaja.

1530
02:26:54.139 --> 02:26:55.723
We are Rosners.
Henry, Manci...

1531
02:26:55.891 --> 02:26:57.475
And Leo.

1532
02:26:57.893 --> 02:26:59.477
- And our son.
- I am Olek.

1533
02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:02.230
Maria Mischel.

1534
02:27:02.606 --> 02:27:04.107
Chaim Nowak.

1535
02:27:05.609 --> 02:27:07.402
Wulkan, Markus.

1536
02:27:07.987 --> 02:27:09.487
Michael Lemper.

1537
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:12.824
Itzhak Stern.

1538
02:27:13.617 --> 02:27:15.827
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1539
02:27:17.121 --> 02:27:19.038
- Rosalia Nussbaum.
- Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1540
02:27:20.124 --> 02:27:21.874
Jakob Levartov.

1541
02:27:22.918 --> 02:27:25.044
- Farber, Rosa.
- Farber, Andrzej.

1542
02:27:25.879 --> 02:27:26.921
Sara.

1543
02:27:27.089 --> 02:27:28.172
Friehof, Fischel.

1544
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:31.175
Mietek Pemper.

1545
02:27:31.885 --> 02:27:33.803
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1546
02:27:34.596 --> 02:27:36.639
Horowitz, Dolek.

1547
02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:39.392
Adam Levy.

1548
02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:41.936
Marcel Goldberg.

1549
02:27:42.646 --> 02:27:44.856
Klipstein, Isak David.

1550
02:27:46.233 --> 02:27:47.608
Altmann, Eduard.

1551
02:27:48.277 --> 02:27:49.819
Grunberg, Miriam.

1552
02:27:50.279 --> 02:27:51.904
Luftig, Eliasz.

1553
02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:53.990
Hilmann, Eduard.

1554
02:27:54.575 --> 02:27:55.950
Erna Rothberg.

1555
02:27:57.244 --> 02:27:58.494
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1556
02:28:00.330 --> 02:28:01.706
Helen Hirsch.

1557
02:28:04.126 --> 02:28:05.960
The worst is over.

1558
02:28:07.546 --> 02:28:10.506
Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1559
02:28:11.842 --> 02:28:16.137
Be careful. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1560
02:28:16.805 --> 02:28:20.767
Watch your step. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1561
02:28:59.264 --> 02:29:03.184
Wonderful, Olek, wonderful.

1562
02:29:03.685 --> 02:29:06.854
You know how we make
ice into water?

1563
02:29:09.525 --> 02:29:11.359
Olek, get another one!

1564
02:29:53.485 --> 02:29:55.236
You'll be pleased
with the level

1565
02:29:55.404 --> 02:29:57.155
of efficiency I get
from these workers.

1566
02:29:59.658 --> 02:30:01.826
Budzyn, under my command,

1567
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:04.912
was the envy of every other commandant
in the labor camp system.

1568
02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:06.372
- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me.

1569
02:30:06.456 --> 02:30:08.916
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

1570
02:30:23.682 --> 02:30:27.101
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow

1571
02:30:27.394 --> 02:30:29.896
and will be arriving here
very shortly.

1572
02:30:30.772 --> 02:30:33.274
I know you've had
a long journey.

1573
02:30:33.692 --> 02:30:36.527
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory,

1574
02:30:36.778 --> 02:30:40.448
where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1575
02:30:42.576 --> 02:30:44.285
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1576
02:30:54.296 --> 02:30:55.713
Beans in cholent?

1577
02:30:55.839 --> 02:30:57.298
Beans are the best part.

1578
02:30:57.507 --> 02:30:58.925
I don't like beans.

1579
02:30:59.968 --> 02:31:03.471
Beans and meat and
potatoes and bread.

1580
02:31:03.847 --> 02:31:06.057
That's not the way
you make cholent.

1581
02:31:10.479 --> 02:31:11.604
Eggs in cholent?

1582
02:31:11.730 --> 02:31:12.855
Yes!

1583
02:31:16.109 --> 02:31:17.235
I don't like cholent.

1584
02:31:17.361 --> 02:31:18.486
No, you don't.

1585
02:31:18.904 --> 02:31:19.987
What do you like?

1586
02:31:20.113 --> 02:31:21.197
I like caviar.

1587
02:31:24.034 --> 02:31:25.660
One day on the fire...

1588
02:32:41.611 --> 02:32:43.738
Wegbleiben vom wagen!

1589
02:32:44.031 --> 02:32:47.033
Wegbleiben vom wagen,
hab ich gesagt!

1590
02:33:10.766 --> 02:33:17.605
Dreißig, fünfunddreißig,
vierzig, fünfundvierzig.

1591
02:33:32.204 --> 02:33:33.454
Where are the list makers?

1592
02:33:33.622 --> 02:33:34.914
Where are the tables?

1593
02:33:58.105 --> 02:33:59.855
Mama, where are we?

1594
02:34:03.985 --> 02:34:05.569
They're in Auschwitz.

1595
02:34:05.654 --> 02:34:08.322
The train was never routed here.
A paperwork mistake.

1596
02:38:05.727 --> 02:38:07.728
Die Hand auf die schulter!

1597
02:38:08.647 --> 02:38:09.897
How old are you, mother?

1598
02:38:10.065 --> 02:38:11.357
Sixty-eight.

1599
02:38:11.566 --> 02:38:12.650
Cough for me, mother.

1600
02:38:12.817 --> 02:38:16.570
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

1601
02:38:16.988 --> 02:38:20.032
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1602
02:38:20.116 --> 02:38:22.868
If you do, you'll never know
what happened to you.

1603
02:38:25.955 --> 02:38:27.206
How old are you, mother?

1604
02:38:27.332 --> 02:38:28.582
Sixty-six, sir.

1605
02:38:28.667 --> 02:38:30.709
- Sir?
- Good morning.

1606
02:38:30.794 --> 02:38:33.796
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.

1607
02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:37.299
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

1608
02:38:37.759 --> 02:38:39.426
Who is Oskar Schindler?

1609
02:38:39.552 --> 02:38:41.178
He had a factory in Krakow.

1610
02:38:41.262 --> 02:38:42.638
Enamelware.

1611
02:38:43.473 --> 02:38:45.057
A pot maker.

1612
02:38:46.101 --> 02:38:47.810
How old are you, mother?

1613
02:38:52.649 --> 02:38:56.318
You are not the only industrialist
who needs labor,

1614
02:38:58.279 --> 02:38:59.446
Herr Schindler.

1615
02:39:00.949 --> 02:39:03.617
I remember earlier this year,
IG Farben ordered

1616
02:39:03.702 --> 02:39:07.955
a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

1617
02:39:09.749 --> 02:39:12.459
The train came in
through the archway

1618
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:17.506
and the officer in charge of the selection
went immediately to work

1619
02:39:19.467 --> 02:39:21.301
and sent 2,000 of them

1620
02:39:22.095 --> 02:39:24.263
straight away to
Special Treatment.

1621
02:39:26.474 --> 02:39:28.642
It is not my task
to interfere with

1622
02:39:28.810 --> 02:39:31.019
the processes that take
place down here.

1623
02:39:33.148 --> 02:39:37.609
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?

1624
02:39:38.319 --> 02:39:40.195
Allow me to
express the reason.

1625
02:39:50.248 --> 02:39:52.750
I'm not making any judgment
about you.

1626
02:39:53.543 --> 02:39:56.295
It's just that I know
that in the coming months,

1627
02:39:56.379 --> 02:39:59.047
we're all going to need
portable wealth.

1628
02:40:02.719 --> 02:40:04.803
I could have you arrested.

1629
02:40:05.472 --> 02:40:09.266
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1630
02:40:13.271 --> 02:40:15.731
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1631
02:40:17.317 --> 02:40:20.444
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1632
02:40:36.085 --> 02:40:38.337
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1633
02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:41.298
I'll cut you
300 units from it.

1634
02:40:41.716 --> 02:40:44.885
New ones.
These are fresh.

1635
02:40:49.724 --> 02:40:51.683
The train comes,
we turn it around.

1636
02:40:51.768 --> 02:40:53.393
Yes, yes.

1637
02:40:53.478 --> 02:40:55.145
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1638
02:40:55.563 --> 02:40:57.022
I want these.

1639
02:41:01.027 --> 02:41:03.111
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1640
02:41:11.162 --> 02:41:14.373
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

1641
02:41:15.542 --> 02:41:19.461
Zoldinger, Ernestina!
Waldergrun, Hilda!

1642
02:41:19.671 --> 02:41:21.505
Waldergrun, Leonora!

1643
02:41:21.798 --> 02:41:25.300
Laast, Anna!
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1644
02:41:25.426 --> 02:41:28.929
Dresner, Chaja!
Dresner, Danka!

1645
02:41:29.055 --> 02:41:32.432
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1646
02:41:32.767 --> 02:41:38.021
Hirsch, Helen! Grosz, Chaja Sara!
Seelenfreund, Estella!

1647
02:42:19.105 --> 02:42:20.981
No! No! No!

1648
02:42:40.335 --> 02:42:43.921
Danka! Danka! Danka!

1649
02:42:44.005 --> 02:42:46.423
No! No! No!

1650
02:42:48.885 --> 02:42:52.346
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1651
02:42:52.764 --> 02:42:56.516
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

1652
02:42:57.518 --> 02:42:59.811
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!

1653
02:43:00.688 --> 02:43:02.230
Essential girls!

1654
02:43:05.610 --> 02:43:09.404
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1655
02:43:10.031 --> 02:43:11.698
How else am I to polish
the inside

1656
02:43:11.866 --> 02:43:13.533
of a 45 millimeter
shell casing?

1657
02:43:13.701 --> 02:43:15.827
You tell me.
You tell me!

1658
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:22.209
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1659
02:45:17.408 --> 02:45:20.368
Under Department W provisions

1660
02:45:21.537 --> 02:45:24.456
it is unlawful to kill a worker
without just cause.

1661
02:45:26.042 --> 02:45:28.543
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund

1662
02:45:29.170 --> 02:45:32.005
I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1663
02:45:33.424 --> 02:45:35.675
If you shoot
without thinking,

1664
02:45:36.636 --> 02:45:39.846
you go to prison,
I get paid.

1665
02:45:41.015 --> 02:45:42.557
That's how it works.

1666
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:47.020
So, there will be
no summary executions here.

1667
02:45:49.357 --> 02:45:52.526
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1668
02:45:54.195 --> 02:45:56.488
In hopes of ensuring that,
guards will

1669
02:45:56.614 --> 02:45:58.865
no longer be allowed
on the factory floor

1670
02:45:59.367 --> 02:46:01.660
without my authorization.

1671
02:46:07.792 --> 02:46:10.627
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1672
02:46:12.713 --> 02:46:14.422
Come on, come.

1673
02:46:17.885 --> 02:46:21.388
Come on, boys, come.

1674
02:46:46.831 --> 02:46:51.209
No doorman or maître d'
will ever mistake you again.

1675
02:46:52.837 --> 02:46:54.004
I promise.

1676
02:46:59.093 --> 02:47:00.510
Itzhak.

1677
02:47:01.929 --> 02:47:03.680
This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant. Itzhak...

1678
02:47:03.764 --> 02:47:05.432
You must be
Mrs. Schindler.

1679
02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:06.892
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

1680
02:47:07.018 --> 02:47:08.310
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

1681
02:47:08.436 --> 02:47:10.145
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

1682
02:47:10.229 --> 02:47:12.606
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1683
02:47:13.149 --> 02:47:15.525
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1684
02:47:15.610 --> 02:47:18.361
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1685
02:47:18.738 --> 02:47:19.821
- Madam.
- Hello.

1686
02:47:19.906 --> 02:47:21.656
- What is it?
- We've received an angry complaint

1687
02:47:21.741 --> 02:47:23.450
from the Armaments Board.

1688
02:47:23.534 --> 02:47:25.660
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,

1689
02:47:25.745 --> 02:47:28.288
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

1690
02:47:28.414 --> 02:47:30.457
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.

1691
02:47:30.541 --> 02:47:32.709
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.

1692
02:47:32.835 --> 02:47:34.669
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

1693
02:47:34.754 --> 02:47:36.588
Sure, so would I,
so would you.

1694
02:47:36.672 --> 02:47:39.007
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll get it right one of these days.

1695
02:47:39.091 --> 02:47:42.886
There's a rumor you've been going around
miscalibrating the machines.

1696
02:47:43.721 --> 02:47:46.640
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1697
02:47:49.477 --> 02:47:51.645
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1698
02:47:51.729 --> 02:47:52.729
Pass them off as ours.

1699
02:47:52.855 --> 02:47:53.855
I don't see the difference.

1700
02:47:53.981 --> 02:47:55.065
Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...

1701
02:47:55.149 --> 02:47:56.733
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

1702
02:47:56.817 --> 02:47:57.776
You'll lose a lot of money.

1703
02:47:57.860 --> 02:47:59.653
Fewer shells will be made.

1704
02:47:59.737 --> 02:48:01.529
Stern, if this factory
ever produces

1705
02:48:01.656 --> 02:48:03.490
a shell that can
actually be fired,

1706
02:48:03.574 --> 02:48:05.033
I'll be very unhappy.

1707
02:48:06.911 --> 02:48:08.954
- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

1708
02:48:23.594 --> 02:48:26.471
How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!

1709
02:48:30.142 --> 02:48:32.018
Good, Herr Direktor.

1710
02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:35.438
Sun's going down.

1711
02:48:38.526 --> 02:48:39.985
Yes, it is.

1712
02:48:41.862 --> 02:48:45.573
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1713
02:48:45.783 --> 02:48:46.866
Is it?

1714
02:48:51.455 --> 02:48:55.166
What's the matter with you?
You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1715
02:48:56.377 --> 02:48:57.752
Shouldn't you?

1716
02:49:05.428 --> 02:49:09.222
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

1717
02:49:30.619 --> 02:49:31.911
Amen.

1718
02:50:25.007 --> 02:50:26.341
What?

1719
02:50:28.219 --> 02:50:33.223
Do you have any money
hidden away someplace

1720
02:50:33.307 --> 02:50:34.891
that I don't know about?

1721
02:50:39.355 --> 02:50:40.438
No.

1722
02:50:46.278 --> 02:50:47.904
Why? Am I broke?

1723
02:50:53.202 --> 02:50:54.494
Well...

1724
02:50:56.497 --> 02:51:01.501
Yesterday morning,
at 2:41 a.m.

1725
02:51:02.837 --> 02:51:05.755
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,

1726
02:51:06.841 --> 02:51:12.846
General Jodl signed the Act
of Unconditional Surrender

1727
02:51:14.056 --> 02:51:18.935
of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe

1728
02:51:19.979 --> 02:51:22.522
to the Allied
Expeditionary Force

1729
02:51:23.858 --> 02:51:27.944
and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.

1730
02:51:28.737 --> 02:51:31.322
The German war is therefore,
at an end.

1731
02:51:32.658 --> 02:51:34.617
But let us not
forget for a moment...

1732
02:51:34.702 --> 02:51:37.745
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1733
02:51:39.373 --> 02:51:41.207
Japan,
with all her treachery...

1734
02:51:42.376 --> 02:51:46.212
The unconditional surrender
of Germany has just been announced.

1735
02:51:48.048 --> 02:51:51.843
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1736
02:51:54.722 --> 02:51:56.973
Tomorrow you'll begin
the process

1737
02:51:57.099 --> 02:51:59.392
of looking for survivors
of your families.

1738
02:52:03.230 --> 02:52:04.689
In most cases,

1739
02:52:06.734 --> 02:52:08.568
you won't find them.

1740
02:52:09.904 --> 02:52:12.113
After six long
years of murder,

1741
02:52:12.823 --> 02:52:15.783
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1742
02:52:18.245 --> 02:52:19.787
We've survived.

1743
02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.584
Many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.

1744
02:52:27.713 --> 02:52:29.380
Thank yourselves.

1745
02:52:31.258 --> 02:52:33.301
Thank your fearless Stern

1746
02:52:34.470 --> 02:52:36.429
and others among you
who worried about you

1747
02:52:36.555 --> 02:52:38.932
and faced death
at every moment.

1748
02:52:43.646 --> 02:52:45.980
I'm a member of
the Nazi Party.

1749
02:52:46.649 --> 02:52:48.900
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1750
02:52:49.693 --> 02:52:51.778
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.

1751
02:52:52.446 --> 02:52:54.364
I am a criminal.

1752
02:52:56.325 --> 02:52:59.452
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1753
02:53:01.872 --> 02:53:05.375
I shall remain with you until five
minutes after midnight,

1754
02:53:05.459 --> 02:53:08.628
after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,

1755
02:53:08.712 --> 02:53:10.255
I have to flee.

1756
02:53:13.717 --> 02:53:16.970
I know you have received orders
from our commandant,

1757
02:53:17.513 --> 02:53:19.639
which he has received
from his superiors,

1758
02:53:19.807 --> 02:53:21.933
to dispose of the population
of this camp.

1759
02:53:23.018 --> 02:53:25.228
Now would be the time
to do it.

1760
02:53:25.312 --> 02:53:29.941
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1761
02:53:35.155 --> 02:53:36.823
Or you could leave

1762
02:53:39.076 --> 02:53:41.536
and return to
your families as men

1763
02:53:41.620 --> 02:53:43.454
instead of murderers.

1764
02:54:25.873 --> 02:54:29.375
In memory of the countless victims
among your people,

1765
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:32.712
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1766
02:55:02.785 --> 02:55:03.910
Amen.

1767
02:55:27.226 --> 02:55:28.267
Amen.

1768
02:55:28.811 --> 02:55:30.061
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1769
02:55:30.187 --> 02:55:31.437
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1770
02:55:32.022 --> 02:55:33.106
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1771
02:55:33.273 --> 02:55:34.357
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1772
02:55:34.525 --> 02:55:35.608
Open wide.

1773
02:55:38.112 --> 02:55:39.612
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1774
02:55:58.632 --> 02:56:00.425
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1775
02:56:25.492 --> 02:56:28.202
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1776
02:56:29.913 --> 02:56:32.623
I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1777
02:56:33.667 --> 02:56:35.793
Two and a half meters each.

1778
02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:39.088
Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

1779
02:56:39.798 --> 02:56:41.966
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1780
02:56:42.718 --> 02:56:45.845
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1781
02:56:46.346 --> 02:56:48.848
It will be done.
Everything you ask.

1782
02:57:09.703 --> 02:57:12.663
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things

1783
02:57:14.208 --> 02:57:15.374
in case you are captured.

1784
02:57:18.462 --> 02:57:20.588
Every worker has signed it.

1785
02:57:31.725 --> 02:57:33.142
Thank you.

1786
02:58:00.796 --> 02:58:02.797
It is Hebrew,
from the Talmud.

1787
02:58:02.881 --> 02:58:06.384
It says, whoever saves one life,
saves the world entire.

1788
02:58:47.634 --> 02:58:49.552
I could have got more out.

1789
02:58:52.639 --> 02:58:54.807
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1790
02:58:55.142 --> 02:58:56.392
If I just...

1791
02:58:58.645 --> 02:58:59.687
I could have got more.

1792
02:58:59.771 --> 02:59:04.066
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

1793
02:59:05.694 --> 02:59:07.653
If I'd made more money.

1794
02:59:11.992 --> 02:59:15.202
I threw away so much money.

1795
02:59:17.873 --> 02:59:20.458
You have no idea.

1796
02:59:21.877 --> 02:59:23.210
If I had just...

1797
02:59:23.295 --> 02:59:26.172
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1798
02:59:28.508 --> 02:59:30.259
I didn't do enough.

1799
02:59:31.178 --> 02:59:32.762
You did so much.

1800
02:59:37.142 --> 02:59:38.434
This car.

1801
02:59:39.895 --> 02:59:42.021
Goeth would've bought
this car.

1802
02:59:42.105 --> 02:59:45.608
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1803
02:59:49.404 --> 02:59:50.988
Ten people.

1804
02:59:53.033 --> 02:59:54.659
Ten more people.

1805
02:59:57.454 --> 02:59:59.038
This pin...

1806
02:59:59.164 --> 03:00:00.581
Two people.

1807
03:00:03.669 --> 03:00:05.127
This is gold.

1808
03:00:05.671 --> 03:00:07.254
Two more people.

1809
03:00:07.547 --> 03:00:10.549
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

1810
03:00:10.676 --> 03:00:12.718
He would have given me one,
one more.

1811
03:00:16.181 --> 03:00:17.807
One more person.

1812
03:00:20.435 --> 03:00:22.061
A person, Stern.

1813
03:00:24.356 --> 03:00:25.690
For this.

1814
03:00:28.402 --> 03:00:31.445
I could have gotten

1815
03:00:32.197 --> 03:00:35.658
one more person, and I didn't.

1816
03:00:37.244 --> 03:00:38.953
And I didn't!

1817
03:02:09.586 --> 03:02:11.796
You have been liberated

1818
03:02:12.255 --> 03:02:14.256
by the Soviet Army!

1819
03:02:22.891 --> 03:02:24.558
Have you been in Poland?

1820
03:02:24.726 --> 03:02:25.976
I just came from Poland.

1821
03:02:29.439 --> 03:02:31.190
Are there any Jews left?

1822
03:02:37.322 --> 03:02:38.823
Where should we go?

1823
03:02:39.699 --> 03:02:42.076
Don't go east,
that's for sure.

1824
03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:43.744
They hate you there.

1825
03:02:45.539 --> 03:02:47.748
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1826
03:02:50.377 --> 03:02:52.336
We could use some food.

1827
03:02:55.048 --> 03:02:57.383
Isn't there a town over there?

1828
03:04:12.125 --> 03:04:13.250
Heil Hitler.
