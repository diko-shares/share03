1
00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.843
And it was evening and it was
morning, the sixth day...

2
00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:48.015
And the heavens and the earth and
all their hosts were completed

3
00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:50.101
And God finished by
the seventh day...

4
00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:52.188
"His" work which "He" had done,

5
00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.273
and "He" rested on the
seventh day from all...

6
00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:56.360
"His" work which "He" had done

7
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.489
And God blessed the seventh
day and sanctified it.

8
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.661
Lord our God, King
of the universe,

9
00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.832
who has sanctified us with His
commandments has desired us

10
00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.590
and has given us, in
love and good will,

11
00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:10.961
His holy Shabbat as a heritage,

12
00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:12.764
in remembrance of the
work of Creation;

13
00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.611
For You have chosen
us and sanctified us

14
00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:16.957
from among all the
nations, and with love

15
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.303
and good will given us Your
holy Shabbat as a heritage.

16
00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:25.561
Blessed are You Lord, who
sanctifies the Shabbat

17
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.279
- Name?
- Horowitz, Salomon.

18
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.619
- Schneider, Sarah.
- Birnbaum, Olga?

19
00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:39.043
- Over there. Over there.
- Come here.

20
00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:43.422
- Isak Hudes.
- Hudes, Isak.

21
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.674
Zucker, Helena.

22
00:02:45.758 --> 00:02:48.302
Zucker, Helena.

23
00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:51.305
- Hirsch, Salomon?
- Mandel, Maria.

24
00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:54.892
- Hauptman, Chaim.
- Weisman. Weisman, Marcus.

25
00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.895
- Feber, Ludwig.
- Feber, Ludwig.

26
00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.065
Elsa Bauman.

27
00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:03.567
- Josef Klein.
- Klein.

28
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:06.328
- Davidowich, Ignacy.
- Paula Biffer.

29
00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:07.615
Nadel, Rachela.

30
00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:10.366
- Steiner, Gertruda.
- Steiner, Hilda.

31
00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.696
- Jerzy, you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

32
00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:34.134
Let's get together, please.

33
00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.054
Smile. Good.

34
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.878
Yes, sir.

35
00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.757
Bring them over a round of drinks.

36
00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:19.054
Very good, sir. And who
shall I say they are from?

37
00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:22.224
You can say they are from me.

38
00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:47.082
- From the gentleman.
- Where?

39
00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:54.840
Do you know him?

40
00:06:54.923 --> 00:06:59.449
- Find out who he is.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:06.310
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight...

42
00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:09.229
but I know you won't.

43
00:07:10.773 --> 00:07:13.567
You embarrass me.

44
00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:24.161
What's he doing?

45
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.540
Stay here.

46
00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:33.316
How are you doing?

47
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:37.925
You'd leave a woman alone at the
table in a place like this?

48
00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:41.261
Sweetheart, you're the
picture of loneliness.

49
00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:46.433
What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

50
00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:49.103
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

51
00:07:49.123 --> 00:07:51.417
- And for the lady?
- Pernod.

52
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.193
"There's a wood sale
in Green Forest..."

53
00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:58.258
"a wood sale."

54
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:02.074
"Wood is being sold
in the Green Forest."

55
00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:04.785
Come to the table,
girls. Drink with us.

56
00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:08.247
"Left around the corner,
right around the corner..."

57
00:08:08.268 --> 00:08:11.000
"there is wood sale everywhere."

58
00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:14.169
Come to us. Merry us.

59
00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:23.783
"The whole trunk costs only
one taler. One taler."

60
00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:28.809
"The whole trunk costs only
one taler, one taler."

61
00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:32.504
Thank you.

62
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:34.711
I'll tell you what I
mean by cooperative.

63
00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:36.540
Two days after the
law is passed that

64
00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:38.159
all Jews have to wear the star...

65
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.428
the Jewish tailors
are turning them

66
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.592
out by the gross in a variety...

67
00:08:40.612 --> 00:08:42.781
of fabrics at three zloty each.

68
00:08:42.802 --> 00:08:44.450
Tell me about your cellar wines.

69
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:47.426
I have an excellent
German Riesling, 1937.

70
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:48.427
French.

71
00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:50.806
A Bordeaux. Chateau
Latour, '28, '29?

72
00:08:50.807 --> 00:08:51.807
No, I'm sorry.

73
00:08:51.874 --> 00:08:54.376
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

74
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.900
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

75
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.860
- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

76
00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:00.752
Burgundy then? A
Romanee-Conti, '37?

77
00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:01.753
Yes.

78
00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.449
It's human nature. "We'll
do this to avoid that."

79
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:07.264
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

80
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:09.078
It's what they do. They
weather the storm.

81
00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:10.950
But this storm is
different. This is

82
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.853
not the Romans. This
storm is the SS.

83
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:16.857
"If God wants to honour you..."

84
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.694
"then he'll send you world wide."

85
00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:28.160
"If god wants to honour you then
he'll send you world wide."

86
00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:31.789
"Faleri, Falera..."

87
00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:35.730
"Faleri Falera-ha ha ha."

88
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:39.400
"Faleri, Falera."

89
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:42.966
"He sends you away world wide"

90
00:09:44.343 --> 00:09:47.534
- Martin?
- Yes, sir.

91
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:50.808
Who is that man?

92
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:54.582
That's Oskar Schindler.

93
00:09:54.603 --> 00:09:58.002
"Faleri, Falera ha ha ha."

94
00:09:58.023 --> 00:10:01.714
"He sends you away world wide."

95
00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:05.239
"Faleri, Falera."

96
00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:07.887
"He sends you away world wide."

97
00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:10.035
To Krakow.

98
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.197
(SINGING SONG IN GERMAN)

99
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.526
(SINGING CONTINUES)

100
00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:49.700
Attention, all Jews.

101
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:53.433
From now on, Jewish art...

102
00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:57.896
meat preparing is forbidden.

103
00:10:57.979 --> 00:11:02.317
Announcement for all
Jews. From now on...

104
00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:21.614
Rabbi...

105
00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:22.890
Private property
cannot be confiscated.

106
00:11:23.067 --> 00:11:25.006
How long are the schools
going to be closed?

107
00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:26.520
I do not know the answer.

108
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.003
Article 47: Pillage is
formally prohibited.

109
00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:29.004
You don't know anything.

110
00:11:29.062 --> 00:11:30.468
I am familiar with the
Hague Convention.

111
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:31.469
Religious...

112
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.225
They come into our house and tell
us we don't live there any more.

113
00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:38.040
It now belongs to a
certain SS officer.

114
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:40.396
Please. I only know
what they tell me.

115
00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:43.525
And what they tell me
changes from day to day.

116
00:11:43.545 --> 00:11:47.007
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

117
00:11:47.132 --> 00:11:50.177
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

118
00:11:50.302 --> 00:11:51.990
What are they going
to do about it?

119
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:53.013
They will shoot you.

120
00:11:53.138 --> 00:11:55.984
Why don't you stop
this silly talk?

121
00:11:55.985 --> 00:11:57.184
Itzhak Stern.

122
00:11:57.309 --> 00:12:00.479
I'm looking for Itzhak Stern.

123
00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:05.171
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

124
00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:08.445
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

125
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:21.959
There's a company you did the
books for, on Lipowa Street.

126
00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:24.461
Made what? Pots and pans?

127
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:27.631
By law, I have to tell
you, sir, I'm a Jew.

128
00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:31.635
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

129
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.142
- A good company, you think?
- Modestly successful.

130
00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:40.394
I know nothing about
enamelware. Do you?

131
00:12:40.415 --> 00:12:43.314
I was just the accountant.

132
00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:45.295
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

133
00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:46.963
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

134
00:12:46.984 --> 00:12:49.570
you could make other
things, couldn't you?

135
00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:54.533
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

136
00:12:56.535 --> 00:12:58.892
Once the war ends, forget
it, but for now it's great.

137
00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:00.873
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

138
00:13:00.894 --> 00:13:04.752
I think most people right
now have other priorities.

139
00:13:04.877 --> 00:13:07.755
Like what?

140
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.049
I'm sure you'll do just fine,
once you get the contracts.

141
00:13:10.174 --> 00:13:12.134
In fact, the worse things
get, the better you'll do.

142
00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:15.929
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

143
00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:19.725
Finding the money to buy
the company, that's hard.

144
00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:21.602
You don't have any money?

145
00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:25.939
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

146
00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:28.942
Jews, yeah.

147
00:13:29.068 --> 00:13:31.591
Investors. You must
have contacts...

148
00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:33.572
in the Jewish business
community working here.

149
00:13:33.656 --> 00:13:36.471
What community? Jews can
no longer own businesses.

150
00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:38.300
That's why this one's
in receivership.

151
00:13:38.301 --> 00:13:39.536
But they wouldn't own it.

152
00:13:39.557 --> 00:13:42.790
I'd own it. I'd pay them back
in product-pots and pans.

153
00:13:42.915 --> 00:13:45.959
- Pots and pans.
- Something they can use.

154
00:13:46.043 --> 00:13:47.628
Something they can
feel in their hands.

155
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:49.922
They can trade it on the black
market, do whatever they want.

156
00:13:49.943 --> 00:13:52.633
Everybody's happy.

157
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.137
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

158
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.227
Let me understand.

159
00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:05.959
They'd put up all the
money, I'd do all the work.

160
00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:09.608
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

161
00:14:09.692 --> 00:14:11.735
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

162
00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:14.134
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

163
00:14:14.217 --> 00:14:18.388
That's what I'm good at. Not
the work, not the work.

164
00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:20.869
The presentation.

165
00:14:38.887 --> 00:14:43.183
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

166
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.750
Well, they should
be, Itzhak Stern.

167
00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:51.254
Tell them they should be.

168
00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.807
Attention, attention.

169
00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:09.189
All Jews. From now on,
it's forbidden...

170
00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:25.726
I've got a client who'll sell
marks for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

171
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:28.020
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

172
00:15:28.103 --> 00:15:30.105
She'll trade it for
ration coupons.

173

- It's shoe polish.
- In metal containers?

You asked for shoe polish.

00:15:51.043 --> 00:15:54.213
In metal containers. This is
glass, it's not what I asked for.

My client sold it to his client,
who sold it to the German Army.

Only by the time it
got there, because...

broke. All 10,000 units.

a nice shirt like that?

00:27:21.108 --> 00:27:25.195
dip it in soap emulsion.

345
00:27:25.216 --> 00:27:29.950
Then place it centrally
in the press.

346
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.552
We obtain the soup
pot. The soup pot.

347
00:27:48.677 --> 00:27:52.014
Soup pot.

348
00:27:52.097 --> 00:27:55.309
Grosz, Mrs Grosz, stay together.

349
00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:01.465
Look, sir, I have ten work permits

350
00:28:01.466 --> 00:28:04.318
here for the German
enamel factory...

351
00:28:04.339 --> 00:28:07.509
and signed by Mr
Bankier and myself.

352
00:28:07.592 --> 00:28:12.409
If it's carbonised,
clean it with a file.

353
00:28:12.534 --> 00:28:17.039
But don't touch both the
electrodes at the same time.

354
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.542
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

355
00:28:24.463 --> 00:28:26.840
Roll the metal under the press...

356
00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:29.447
but be very careful unless
you want your fingers...

357
00:28:29.468 --> 00:28:32.721
to become part of the teapot.

358
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.622
- Occupation?
- I'm a writer. I play the flute.

359
00:28:37.643 --> 00:28:41.021
But Moses is a
skilled metalworker.

360
00:28:41.042 --> 00:28:43.524
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

361
00:28:43.607 --> 00:28:45.505
He can make whatever
Mr Schindler asks.

362
00:28:45.588 --> 00:28:48.237
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

363
00:28:48.258 --> 00:28:50.948
Moses, give him your card.

364
00:28:52.574 --> 00:28:58.101
Now, dip the basin with the
tongs into the enamel solution.

365
00:28:59.477 --> 00:29:01.785
And after swivelling it around,

366
00:29:01.786 --> 00:29:04.691
carefully place it
aside to drip-dry.

367
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.183
And whatever he asks
you, allow me just

368
00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:11.051
to represent you
and speak for you.

369
00:29:11.135 --> 00:29:12.928
Don't say a word.

370
00:29:13.012 --> 00:29:16.557
Filing, billing, keeping track
of my appointments, shorthand.

371
00:29:16.578 --> 00:29:19.451
Typing, obviously.
How is your typing?

372
00:29:19.452 --> 00:29:20.644
All right.

373
00:29:20.728 --> 00:29:22.730
Please.

374
00:30:15.741 --> 00:30:19.453
You need a secretary. Pick one.

375
00:30:19.578 --> 00:30:24.458
I don't know how. They're
all so... qualified.

376
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:27.461
You have to choose.

377
00:30:29.755 --> 00:30:32.549
Big smile, big smile.

378
00:30:53.612 --> 00:30:56.490
If you would, look after my guest.

379
00:30:56.615 --> 00:31:01.516
Boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté...

380
00:31:01.537 --> 00:31:05.457
kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar...

381
00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:07.584
and, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

382
00:31:07.605 --> 00:31:10.170
Get me as many as you can find.

383
00:31:10.295 --> 00:31:12.256
And some more fresh fruit.

384
00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:15.301
The real rarities, oranges,
lemons, pineapples.

385
00:31:15.384 --> 00:31:17.803
I need several boxes of
Cuban cigars. The best.

386
00:31:17.928 --> 00:31:19.164
And dark unsweetened chocolate...

387
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.557
not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

388
00:31:21.598 --> 00:31:24.648
Big as my hand, you
sample at wine tastings.

389
00:31:24.685 --> 00:31:28.022
We're going to need lots of
cognac. The best, Hennessy.

390
00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:33.110
Dom Perignon champagne.
Get L'espadon sardines...

391
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:37.031
and, oh, try to find
nylon stockings.

392
00:31:39.325 --> 00:31:42.578
It is my distinct
pleasure to announce...

393
00:31:42.661 --> 00:31:48.354
the fully operational status
of German enamel factory...

394
00:31:49.043 --> 00:31:53.047
manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...

395
00:31:53.276 --> 00:31:58.552
expressly designed and
crafted for military use.

396
00:31:58.677 --> 00:32:01.347
Utilising only the most
modern equipment...

397
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.886
D.E.F.'s staff of
highly skilled and

398
00:32:03.887 --> 00:32:06.477
experienced artisans
and journeymen...

399
00:32:06.602 --> 00:32:10.105
deliver a product of
unparalleled quality...

400
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.151
enabling me to proffer, with
absolute confidence and pride...

401
00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:16.820
a full line of field
and kitchenware...

402
00:32:16.945 --> 00:32:20.991
unsurpassable in all
respects by my competitors.

403
00:32:21.116 --> 00:32:24.328
See attached list and
available colours.

404
00:32:24.828 --> 00:32:28.582
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval...

405
00:32:28.603 --> 00:32:32.503
looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association...

406
00:32:32.628 --> 00:32:35.735
I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

407
00:32:35.756 --> 00:32:38.842
and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

408
00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:42.346
Yeah, I need 700 gross from
here for next Thursday.

409
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:45.182
Nine hundred, no, make
it ten for Wednesday.

410
00:32:45.307 --> 00:32:48.003
All this stuff here
goes to Madritsch's

411
00:32:48.004 --> 00:32:50.229
factory on Tuesday of next week.

412
00:33:04.994 --> 00:33:08.372
My father was fond of saying, "You
need three things in life..."

413
00:33:08.497 --> 00:33:13.064
"a good doctor, a
forgiving priest..."

414
00:33:13.085 --> 00:33:15.879
"and a clever accountant."

415
00:33:19.341 --> 00:33:23.304
The first two, I've
never had much use for.

416
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.890
But the third.

417
00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:36.337
Just pretend, for Christ's sake.

418
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.573
Is that all?

419
00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:50.581
I'm trying to thank you.

420
00:33:50.914 --> 00:33:54.835
I'm saying I couldn't have
done this without you.

421
00:33:57.379 --> 00:34:00.257
The usual thing would be to
acknowledge my gratitude.

422
00:34:00.382 --> 00:34:05.220
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

423
00:34:05.304 --> 00:34:08.057
You're welcome.

424
00:34:17.086 --> 00:34:19.485
Get out of here.

425
00:34:32.665 --> 00:34:35.876
Klonowska, who is it?

426
00:34:45.177 --> 00:34:48.347
She's so embarrassed. Look at her.

427
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.111
You know something?
You would like her.

428
00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:04.196
- Oskar, please.
- What?

429
00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:06.657
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.

430
00:35:06.782 --> 00:35:09.451
It doesn't work that way.

431
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.175
You've done well here.

432
00:35:27.636 --> 00:35:30.180
You look wonderful.

433
00:35:32.975 --> 00:35:37.563
- Be careful of the step, miss.
- Mrs Schindler, Marek.

434
00:35:49.241 --> 00:35:51.318
It's not a charade, all this?

435
00:35:51.319 --> 00:35:53.933
Charade? How could
it be a charade?

436
00:35:53.996 --> 00:35:55.249
The clothes, the
car, the apartment.

437
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.250
Wait a minute.

438
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:58.980
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

439
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:00.232
Oskar.

440
00:36:00.252 --> 00:36:05.403
My father, at the height of his
success, had 50. I've got 350.

441
00:36:05.487 --> 00:36:10.054
350 workers on the factory
floor, with one purpose.

442
00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:12.181
To make pots and pans?

443
00:36:12.264 --> 00:36:16.185
To make money. For me.

444
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.090
Does anyone ask about me?

445
00:36:26.612 --> 00:36:32.889
Back home? Everybody.
All the time.

446
00:36:36.851 --> 00:36:39.483
They won't soon forget the name

447
00:36:39.484 --> 00:36:42.711
Schindler here, I
can tell you that.

448
00:36:43.316 --> 00:36:46.590
"Oskar Schindler" they'll say.

449
00:36:46.632 --> 00:36:50.260
"Everybody remembers him."

450
00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:54.556
"He did something extraordinary."

451
00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:59.770
"He did something
no one else did."

452
00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:06.026
"He came here with
nothing, a suitcase...

453
00:37:06.193 --> 00:37:12.199
"and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory."

454
00:37:12.324 --> 00:37:15.452
"And left with a steamer trunk..."

455
00:37:15.577 --> 00:37:20.124
"two steamer trunks
full of money."

456
00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:24.420
"All the riches of the world."

457
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.009
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

458
00:37:30.134 --> 00:37:33.470
You're wrong, Emilie.

459
00:37:34.075 --> 00:37:36.598
There's no way I could have
known this before but...

460
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:39.476
there was always
something missing.

461
00:37:39.664 --> 00:37:43.647
In every business I tried, I can
see now, it wasn't me that failed.

462
00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:46.483
Something was missing.

463
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:48.424
Even if I'd known
what it was, there's

464
00:37:48.425 --> 00:37:50.154
nothing I could have
done about it...

465
00:37:50.237 --> 00:37:54.825
because you can't
create this thing.

466
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.697
And it makes all the
difference in the

467
00:37:57.698 --> 00:38:00.164
world between success and failure.

468
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.833
Luck?

469
00:38:05.294 --> 00:38:08.172
War.

470
00:38:31.654 --> 00:38:35.366
Should I stay?

471
00:38:36.012 --> 00:38:39.265
It's a beautiful city.

472
00:38:40.287 --> 00:38:44.521
I asked you if I should stay.

473
00:38:45.855 --> 00:38:48.295
It's up to you.

474
00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:56.887
Promise me, Oskar. No doorman or
maitre d' will ever presume...

475
00:38:56.971 --> 00:39:02.351
I'm anyone other than Mrs
Schindler, and I'll stay.

476
00:39:04.603 --> 00:39:06.814
Goodbye, darling.

477
00:39:23.455 --> 00:39:25.548
I could try to read
this or I could

478
00:39:25.549 --> 00:39:27.584
eat my lunch while it's still hot.

479
00:39:27.935 --> 00:39:29.166
We're doing well?

480
00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:30.563
- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

481
00:39:30.584 --> 00:39:31.584
Yes.

482
00:39:31.658 --> 00:39:33.379
Any reason to think next
month will be worse?

483
00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.135
The war could end.

484
00:39:46.645 --> 00:39:49.189
- What?
- There is a machinist outside...

485
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:52.359
who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

486
00:39:52.484 --> 00:39:54.737
Every day he comes. He's very

487
00:39:54.738 --> 00:39:57.614
grateful. It'll
just take a minute.

488
00:40:03.454 --> 00:40:05.873
Mr Lowenstein.

489
00:40:12.775 --> 00:40:15.883
I want to thank you, sir...

490
00:40:15.966 --> 00:40:18.656
for giving me the
opportunity to work.

491
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.722
You're welcome. I'm sure
you're doing a great job.

492
00:40:21.847 --> 00:40:26.101
The SS beat me up. They
would have killed me...

493
00:40:26.498 --> 00:40:30.856
but I am essential to the
war effort, thanks to you.

494
00:40:30.939 --> 00:40:32.941
That's great.

495
00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:35.298
I work hard for you.

496
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:36.757
I'm sure you do.

497
00:40:36.758 --> 00:40:39.740
I'll continue to
work hard for you.

498
00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:41.784
That's great. Thanks.

499
00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:44.244
- God bless you, sir.
- All right.

500
00:40:44.265 --> 00:40:48.082
You are a good man.

501
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:52.586
- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did.

502
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:56.236
- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on.

503
00:40:57.549 --> 00:41:00.427
God bless you.

504
00:41:12.398 --> 00:41:15.088
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor, but
you're running very late.

505
00:41:15.171 --> 00:41:18.696
This is for the major, sir.

506
00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:21.740
And this is for his niece,
Greta. It's her birthday.

507
00:41:21.824 --> 00:41:24.535
- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again.

508
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.204
Go. Go, go, drive. Don't bow.

509
00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:30.269
Did you notice that
man had one arm?

510
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.270
Did he?

511
00:41:34.962 --> 00:41:38.173
- What's his use?
- Very useful.

512
00:41:40.342 --> 00:41:44.138
- How?
- Very useful. Success.

513
00:42:12.604 --> 00:42:14.647
You'll be given
brooms and shovels...

514
00:42:14.668 --> 00:42:17.713
each of you will grab one and
start cleaning the street.

515
00:42:17.796 --> 00:42:20.799
We'll be late for work.

516
00:42:32.311 --> 00:42:35.356
You shouldn't think of
them as yours, Oskar.

517
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:37.378
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

518
00:42:37.399 --> 00:42:40.235
don't give a damn
about production.

519
00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:44.406
To them, it's a matter
of, national priority...

520
00:42:44.531 --> 00:42:46.888
that Jews be made to shovel snow.

521
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.411
It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.

522
00:42:49.495 --> 00:42:51.580
You know it and I know it.

523
00:42:51.664 --> 00:42:53.916
Jews shovelling snow.

524
00:42:53.999 --> 00:42:58.712
It's got a, ritual significance.

525
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:03.801
- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker.

526
00:43:03.926 --> 00:43:06.595
- Essential worker?
- Yes.

527
00:43:09.556 --> 00:43:11.041
I work for Oskar Schindler.

528
00:43:11.042 --> 00:43:13.143
Essential worker for
Oskar Schindler.

529
00:43:13.227 --> 00:43:15.791
A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless.

530
00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:16.792
Yes, yes.

531
00:43:17.293 --> 00:43:20.734
I lost a day of production, Rolf.

532
00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:23.988
I work for Oskar Schindler.

533
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.117
Danka, look at the snow. Look
at the snow. Look at the snow.

534
00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:36.000
I lost a worker. I expect
to be compensated.

535
00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:39.003
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

536
00:43:39.128 --> 00:43:42.819
- Would it do any good?
- Of course not.

537
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.437
A big shot from the SS Budget and

538
00:43:46.438 --> 00:43:48.324
Construction Office
came to lunch...

539
00:43:48.345 --> 00:43:50.393
and he told us that to believe the

540
00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.683
Jewish skilled worker
had a place...

541
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:57.479
in Reich economics was
a treasonable idea.

542
00:44:01.087 --> 00:44:05.696
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

543
00:44:05.717 --> 00:44:08.761
He was a metal press operator.

544
00:44:12.515 --> 00:44:14.872
Quite skilled.

545
00:44:43.901 --> 00:44:45.944
Mr Director.

546
00:44:46.028 --> 00:44:48.405
Shit. I don't believe it.

547
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.741
Stern, is that you?

548
00:44:50.866 --> 00:44:54.953
No, it's Poldek. It's about Stern.

549
00:44:55.454 --> 00:44:58.916
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

550
00:44:59.041 --> 00:45:01.085
Clearly label it.

551
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.381
Given name first,
then your surname.

552
00:45:05.464 --> 00:45:08.050
Do not bring your
baggage with you.

553
00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:11.011
It will follow you later.

554
00:45:11.136 --> 00:45:14.452
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

555
00:45:14.536 --> 00:45:16.329
Clearly label it.

556
00:45:16.412 --> 00:45:20.437
Leave your luggage
on the platform.

557
00:45:21.397 --> 00:45:22.815
Stern?

558
00:45:25.484 --> 00:45:28.570
- He's on the list.
- He is?

559
00:45:28.654 --> 00:45:31.532
- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him.

560
00:45:31.657 --> 00:45:33.130
He's on the list. If
he were an essential

561
00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:34.430
worker, he would not
be on the list.

562
00:45:34.451 --> 00:45:37.371
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

563
00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:40.541
- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list.

564
00:45:40.562 --> 00:45:44.712
- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber.

565
00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:46.839
Tauber.

566
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.759
Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

567
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.554
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

568
00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:55.533
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

569
00:45:55.535 --> 00:45:57.704
and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

570
00:45:57.787 --> 00:45:59.524
Attention. The train
is about to leave.

571
00:45:59.525 --> 00:46:00.525
Is he on the list?

572
00:46:00.526 --> 00:46:04.690
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

573
00:46:04.773 --> 00:46:10.529
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

574
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.490
- What is your name?
- Close and secure all doors.

575
00:46:13.615 --> 00:46:16.994
- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

576
00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:19.455
- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

577
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.540
- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

578
00:46:21.623 --> 00:46:23.751
Schindler. S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

579
00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:26.170
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

580
00:46:26.295 --> 00:46:28.881
I think I can guarantee
you you'll both be in...

581
00:46:28.964 --> 00:46:32.676
Southern Russia before the
end of the month. Good day.

582
00:46:35.804 --> 00:46:37.765
Stern.

583
00:46:37.848 --> 00:46:39.767
- Stern.
- Stern.

584
00:46:39.892 --> 00:46:41.852
Itzhak Stern.

585
00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:50.903
Stern. Itzhak Stern.

586
00:46:50.986 --> 00:46:53.697
- Stern. Stern.
- Itzhak Stern.

587
00:46:55.074 --> 00:46:58.452
- Stern.
- Sir.

588
00:47:00.266 --> 00:47:02.706
- Stern.
- Herr Direktor.

589
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.668
My apologies.

590
00:47:05.751 --> 00:47:08.671
- Stop the train. He's here.
- I apologise.

591
00:47:08.754 --> 00:47:13.717
- Stop the train.
- Stop the train. Stop it.

592
00:47:26.167 --> 00:47:30.025
Sign here. Initial there.

593
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:34.509
Makes no difference to us, you
understand. This one, that one.

594
00:47:34.905 --> 00:47:36.865
It's the inconvenience
to the list.

595
00:47:36.991 --> 00:47:38.268
It's the paperwork.

596
00:47:38.269 --> 00:47:40.703
I somehow left my
work card at home.

597
00:47:40.786 --> 00:47:44.540
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

598
00:47:44.623 --> 00:47:46.222
I'm sorry, it was stupid.

599
00:47:46.223 --> 00:47:48.711
What if I got here
five minutes later?

600
00:47:48.794 --> 00:47:51.505
Then where would I be?

601
00:49:42.992 --> 00:49:45.536
I woke up from a
dream this morning.

602
00:49:45.661 --> 00:49:49.873
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know...

603
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.152
only to discover I was
broke and sharing

604
00:49:53.153 --> 00:49:55.963
a room with 12 people
I didn't know.

605
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.674
- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh.

606
00:49:58.757 --> 00:50:01.385
You are living behind walls.

607
00:50:01.468 --> 00:50:04.013
The walls I can deal with.

608
00:50:04.014 --> 00:50:06.557
It's the restrictions to
my life I'm tired of.

609
00:50:06.682 --> 00:50:09.289
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

610
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.563
I like it here. There's a
kind of, I don't know...

611
00:50:12.688 --> 00:50:14.940
ancestral squalor to it all.

612
00:50:15.024 --> 00:50:17.192
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more.

613
00:50:17.276 --> 00:50:19.403
- I'm smart.
- Oh, yes, you're smart.

614
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.780
- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance.

615
00:50:21.864 --> 00:50:26.493
Today, today I actually found
time to organise a thought.

616
00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.371
I can't remember the
last time I did that.

617
00:50:29.455 --> 00:50:31.248
When's the last time we did this?

618
00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:33.834
When's the last time we
stood around and talked?

619
00:50:33.959 --> 00:50:37.254
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

620
00:50:37.379 --> 00:50:39.590
No one took my
business away from me.

621
00:50:39.715 --> 00:50:41.717
You don't really have
a business to take.

622
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.094
There's nowhere down from here.

623
00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:46.430
This is it. This is the bottom.

624
00:50:46.555 --> 00:50:50.476
The ghetto is, liberty.

625
00:50:56.482 --> 00:50:59.777
This street divides the
ghetto just about in half.

626
00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:05.240
Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees...

627
00:51:05.324 --> 00:51:08.202
industrial workers and so on.

628
00:51:08.327 --> 00:51:13.311
Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour...

629
00:51:13.749 --> 00:51:16.126
the elderly and infirm mostly.

630
00:51:16.147 --> 00:51:18.629
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

631
00:51:18.796 --> 00:51:21.110
Do you have any questions, sir?

632
00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:24.551
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

633
00:51:26.325 --> 00:51:29.140
We expect a labour force
of 25.000 to 30.000.

634
00:51:29.141 --> 00:51:32.582
Segregated of course. The men in
the barracks near the guarry...

635
00:51:32.685 --> 00:51:34.435
the women on the other
side of the wire.

636
00:51:34.436 --> 00:51:35.436
My place is where?

637
00:51:35.437 --> 00:51:37.168
- There, sir.
- There?

638
00:51:37.189 --> 00:51:40.067
- Yes, the villa.
- You call that a villa?

639
00:51:40.088 --> 00:51:42.173
- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa.

640
00:51:42.194 --> 00:51:44.979
We' to turn it into
the camp stables.

641
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.094
It's a house.

642
00:51:46.177 --> 00:51:49.222
What's that over there?

643
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:52.579
Playground. Fifty-one.

644
00:51:52.705 --> 00:51:57.251
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

645
00:51:59.482 --> 00:52:03.007
There they are, sir.

646
00:52:06.927 --> 00:52:10.681
One of you is, a very lucky girl.

647
00:52:10.806 --> 00:52:14.560
There is an opening for a job...

648
00:52:14.643 --> 00:52:18.522
away from all this,
backbreaking work...

649
00:52:18.647 --> 00:52:22.192
at my new villa.

650
00:52:25.758 --> 00:52:29.888
Which of you has
domestic experience?

651
00:52:32.765 --> 00:52:37.082
Yeah, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.

652
00:52:37.145 --> 00:52:40.586
All those annoying
habits I have to undo.

653
00:52:45.341 --> 00:52:48.260
I don't want to give you my cold.

654
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.387
What's your name?

655
00:52:50.512 --> 00:52:52.890
- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

656
00:52:52.973 --> 00:52:54.767
Helen Hirsch.

657
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:59.521
- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch.

658
00:53:14.953 --> 00:53:17.539
- Yes.
- Take it all down.

659
00:53:17.623 --> 00:53:19.729
- Back to your work.
- To work.

660
00:53:19.813 --> 00:53:23.921
Take it down. It is not safe.

661
00:53:23.962 --> 00:53:27.383
She says the foundation was poured
wrong. She's got to take it down.

662
00:53:27.466 --> 00:53:30.552
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

663
00:53:30.636 --> 00:53:34.890
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch.

664
00:53:34.974 --> 00:53:39.228
Herr Kommandant. The
entire foundation...

665
00:53:39.311 --> 00:53:42.064
has to be torn down and repoured.

666
00:53:42.147 --> 00:53:45.567
If not, there will be at
least a subsidence...

667
00:53:45.651 --> 00:53:48.237
at the southern end
of the barracks.

668
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.906
Subsidence, and then collapse.

669
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:53.742
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes.

670
00:53:53.826 --> 00:53:56.245
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

671
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.706
of Civil Engineering from
the University of Milan.

672
00:53:58.789 --> 00:54:03.252
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

673
00:54:10.592 --> 00:54:14.013
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

674
00:54:14.138 --> 00:54:18.142
- Shoot her.
- What?

675
00:54:18.267 --> 00:54:22.771
Commander. I'm only
trying to do my job.

676
00:54:22.855 --> 00:54:24.440
Yeah, I'm doing mine.

677
00:54:24.523 --> 00:54:26.984
Sir, she's foreman
of construction.

678
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:29.486
We are not going to have
arguments with these people.

679
00:54:30.029 --> 00:54:31.572
Okay.

680
00:54:33.115 --> 00:54:36.952
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.

681
00:54:47.629 --> 00:54:52.760
- It will take more than that.
- I'm sure, you are right.

682
00:54:59.308 --> 00:55:04.188
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

683
00:55:04.313 --> 00:55:08.525
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

684
00:55:19.328 --> 00:55:22.873
Today is history.

685

the blame for the Black Death...

691
00:55:50.776 --> 00:55:54.071

could come to Krakow.

692
00:55:54.092 --> 00:55:56.740
- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

Not that fat. No, less.

694
00:55:58.410 --> 00:55:59.952
They trundled their
belongings into the city.

- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled...

696

making so much money

about 6.00 this morning?

- May I try that, sir?

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:43.913
Mr Director.

1035
01:29:43.997 --> 01:29:46.541
Mr Director.

1036
01:29:49.023 --> 01:29:51.671
Mr Director.

1037
01:29:53.548 --> 01:29:54.716
He was making hinges slowly.

1038
01:29:54.757 --> 01:29:57.559
So the man can turn
out a hinge in less

1039
01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.013
than a minute. Why the long story?

1040
01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:31.836
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

1041
01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:37.173
Nobody knows who
stole the chicken?

1042
01:30:37.174 --> 01:30:38.885
Tell him about the chicken.

1043
01:30:38.968 --> 01:30:43.765
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

1044
01:30:43.848 --> 01:30:46.434
Save yourselves.

1045
01:30:46.518 --> 01:30:48.937
Tell him about the chicken.

1046
01:31:04.536 --> 01:31:06.704
Still nobody knows?

1047
01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.137
It was you. You
committed this crime.

1048
01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.639
- No, sir.
- But you know who, though.

1049
01:31:24.722 --> 01:31:26.975
- Yes.
- Who?

1050
01:31:27.997 --> 01:31:30.103
Him.

1051
01:31:33.565 --> 01:31:37.485
- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

1052
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.159
Sir, thank you.

1053
01:31:50.290 --> 01:31:53.084
- Thank you again, Mr Director.
- You're welcome again.

1054
01:31:53.168 --> 01:31:55.649
It's an honour to work for
such a great company.

1055
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:56.693
It's great to have you.

1056
01:31:56.775 --> 01:31:58.623
I promise to learn
everything there's

1057
01:31:58.624 --> 01:32:00.425
to know about
enamelware production.

1058
01:32:00.426 --> 01:32:01.990
That's great.

1059
01:32:13.563 --> 01:32:17.942
- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

1060
01:32:18.026 --> 01:32:20.737
She wants to speak to Mr Director.

1061
01:32:40.256 --> 01:32:42.467
Yes.

1062
01:32:46.721 --> 01:32:49.495
He won't see you.

1063
01:33:19.587 --> 01:33:21.756
Please, sit down.

1064
01:33:24.843 --> 01:33:28.075
- Pernod? Cognac?
- No. No, thank you.

1065
01:33:29.013 --> 01:33:32.559
So, what can I do for you?

1066
01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:39.149
They say that no one dies here.

1067
01:33:39.232 --> 01:33:42.798
They say your factory is a haven.

1068
01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.781
They say you are good.

1069
01:33:49.784 --> 01:33:51.995
Who says that?

1070
01:33:52.078 --> 01:33:54.247
Everyone.

1071
01:34:00.545 --> 01:34:03.047
My name is Regina
Perlman, not Elsa Krause.

1072
01:34:03.131 --> 01:34:04.964
I've been living
in Krakow on false

1073
01:34:04.965 --> 01:34:06.697
papers since the ghetto massacre.

1074
01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.386
My parents are in Plaszow.

1075
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:12.974
Their names are Chana
and Jakob Perlman.

1076
01:34:13.057 --> 01:34:14.705
They are older people. They are

1077
01:34:14.706 --> 01:34:16.728
killing older people
now in Plaszow.

1078
01:34:16.769 --> 01:34:21.107
They bury them up in
the forest. Look...

1079
01:34:21.191 --> 01:34:23.902
I don't have any money.

1080
01:34:23.985 --> 01:34:27.426
I borrowed these clothes.

1081
01:34:29.574 --> 01:34:31.659
I'm begging you.

1082
01:34:31.743 --> 01:34:35.559
Please, please bring them here.

1083
01:34:35.643 --> 01:34:38.145
I don't do that.

1084
01:34:38.228 --> 01:34:41.940
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

1085
01:34:42.024 --> 01:34:45.548
Whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

1086
01:34:45.632 --> 01:34:48.134
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

1087
01:34:48.176 --> 01:34:52.722
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me.

1088
01:34:52.806 --> 01:34:56.935
Cry, and I will have you
arrested. I swear to God.

1089
01:35:06.507 --> 01:35:09.280
People die. It's a fact of life.

1090
01:35:09.364 --> 01:35:12.992
He wants to kill everybody? Great.
What am I supposed to do about it?

1091
01:35:13.076 --> 01:35:15.829
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

1092
01:35:15.912 --> 01:35:18.852
Send them over to
Schindler. Send them all.

1093
01:35:18.936 --> 01:35:22.710
His place is a haven, didn't
you know? It's not a factory.

1094
01:35:22.794 --> 01:35:25.046
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

1095
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:27.841
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans...

1096
01:35:27.924 --> 01:35:31.386
and people with no
skills whatsoever.

1097
01:35:33.346 --> 01:35:35.723
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

1098
01:35:35.807 --> 01:35:39.394
You're so quiet all the
time. I know, I know.

1099
01:35:39.477 --> 01:35:42.188
- Are you losing money?
- That's not the point.

1100
01:35:42.272 --> 01:35:44.219
What other point is...

1101
01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.548
It's dangerous. It's
dangerous to me.

1102
01:35:50.384 --> 01:35:54.075
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.

1103
01:35:54.159 --> 01:35:57.412
You have to think of
it in his situation.

1104
01:35:57.808 --> 01:36:00.415
He's got this whole place to run.

1105
01:36:00.498 --> 01:36:03.209
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.

1106
01:36:03.293 --> 01:36:06.629
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.

1107
01:36:06.817 --> 01:36:10.675
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.

1108
01:36:10.758 --> 01:36:14.262
Never the good, always
the bad. Always the bad.

1109
01:36:16.514 --> 01:36:19.027
But in normal
circumstances he wouldn't

1110
01:36:19.028 --> 01:36:21.102
be like this. He'd be all right.

1111
01:36:21.186 --> 01:36:24.647
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which...

1112
01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:28.443
He's a wonderful crook.

1113
01:36:28.526 --> 01:36:32.906
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...

1114
01:36:32.989 --> 01:36:35.283
Killing.

1115
01:36:35.366 --> 01:36:38.119
He can't enjoy it.

1116
01:36:38.203 --> 01:36:41.289
Bejski told me the other
day, somebody escaped...

1117
01:36:41.372 --> 01:36:44.396
from a work detail
outside the wire.

1118
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.171
Goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.

1119
01:36:48.254 --> 01:36:50.001
He shot the man to the left of

1120
01:36:50.002 --> 01:36:52.217
Bejski, the man to
the right of him.

1121
01:36:52.258 --> 01:36:56.179
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

1122
01:37:01.267 --> 01:37:03.770
Twenty-five.

1123
01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:10.094
What do you want
me to do about it?

1124
01:37:10.095 --> 01:37:11.361
Nothing, nothing.

1125
01:37:11.444 --> 01:37:13.780
We're just talking.

1126
01:37:25.667 --> 01:37:27.377
"Perlman."

1127
01:37:29.087 --> 01:37:31.089
Perlman.

1128
01:37:32.006 --> 01:37:33.967
Husband and wife.

1129
01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:38.242
Jakob and Chana Perlman.

1130
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:54.404
Have Goldberg bring them over.

1131
01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:59.701
Caps off.

1132
01:37:59.784 --> 01:38:01.911
Ready for inspection.

1133
01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:39.167
(GUESTS SINGING
DRUNKENLY IN GERMAN)

1134
01:38:49.563 --> 01:38:53.755
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

1135
01:38:53.838 --> 01:38:57.655
Mr Director, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something...

1136
01:38:57.738 --> 01:39:00.762
to clean the stains from
the Commander's bathtub.

1137
01:39:00.845 --> 01:39:03.765
- Go clean it.
- Pardon me, Sir.

1138
01:39:07.352 --> 01:39:10.668
You don't have to
report to me, Helen.

1139
01:39:10.751 --> 01:39:13.650
You know who I am?

1140
01:39:21.741 --> 01:39:25.036
I'm Schindler.

1141
01:39:25.119 --> 01:39:28.644
Of course. I have heard and...

1142
01:39:28.832 --> 01:39:31.981
you have been here before.

1143
01:39:33.753 --> 01:39:36.548
Here, why don't you
keep this some place?

1144
01:39:36.631 --> 01:39:40.135
- Go on, take it.
- I get extra food here.

1145
01:39:40.218 --> 01:39:45.640
Well, if you don't want to eat it,
trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

1146
01:39:47.725 --> 01:39:50.103
Why not build yourself up?

1147
01:39:54.586 --> 01:39:58.507
My first day here, he beat me...

1148
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:02.615
because I threw out the
bones from dinner.

1149
01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:10.331
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

1150
01:40:10.415 --> 01:40:13.126
he asked me where they were.

1151
01:40:15.607 --> 01:40:20.216
For his dogs, you understand?

1152
01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:26.556
I said to him, I don't
know how I say this.

1153
01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:30.143
I never could say it
now, I said to him...

1154
01:40:30.226 --> 01:40:33.646
"Why are you beating me?"

1155
01:40:35.899 --> 01:40:39.569
He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

1156
01:40:39.652 --> 01:40:43.886
is because you ask
why I beat you."

1157
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:48.411
I know your sufferings, Helen.

1158
01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:53.249
It doesn't matter.

1159
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:57.921
I have accepted them.

1160
01:40:58.004 --> 01:41:00.256
Accepted them?

1161
01:41:02.091 --> 01:41:03.843
One day he will shoot me.

1162
01:41:03.885 --> 01:41:06.763
No, no, no, no, he
won't shoot you.

1163
01:41:06.846 --> 01:41:10.517
I know. I see things.

1164
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.103
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I...

1165
01:41:14.187 --> 01:41:18.107
and we saw the Commander come
out of the front door and...

1166
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:23.029
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and...

1167
01:41:23.112 --> 01:41:28.034
and there on the steps he
drew his gun and he...

1168
01:41:28.117 --> 01:41:31.454
shot a woman who was passing by.

1169
01:41:32.539 --> 01:41:35.771
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1170
01:41:35.854 --> 01:41:39.546
Just-Just a woman on her
way somewhere, you know.

1171
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:43.341
She was no fatter or thinner...

1172
01:41:43.424 --> 01:41:45.844
or slower or faster
than anyone else...

1173
01:41:45.927 --> 01:41:51.036
and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1174
01:41:54.435 --> 01:41:57.897
The more you see of
the Commander...

1175
01:41:57.981 --> 01:42:03.215
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.

1176
01:42:03.507 --> 01:42:06.194
You can't say to yourself, "If I

1177
01:42:06.195 --> 01:42:09.388
follow these rules,
I will be safe."

1178
01:42:11.828 --> 01:42:16.082
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.

1179
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:20.357
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.

1180
01:42:20.441 --> 01:42:25.779
He doesn't want anyone else to
know, it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1181
01:42:28.574 --> 01:42:32.067
He shot the woman
from the steps...

1182
01:42:32.068 --> 01:42:35.560
because she meant nothing to him.

1183
01:42:35.873 --> 01:42:42.004
She was one of a series neither
offending or pleasing him.

1184
01:42:44.486 --> 01:42:47.655
But you, Helen.

1185
01:42:51.534 --> 01:42:56.810
It's all right. It's not
that kind of a kiss.

1186
01:43:01.732 --> 01:43:03.630
Thank you.

1187
01:43:08.426 --> 01:43:10.303
Here.

1188
01:43:16.163 --> 01:43:18.645
Right, the wine.

1189
01:43:25.568 --> 01:43:29.301
Wonderful party, Amon. Thank you.

1190
01:43:37.038 --> 01:43:40.479
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1191
01:43:40.562 --> 01:43:43.336
I send you good
stuff all the time.

1192
01:43:43.419 --> 01:43:47.340
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1193
01:43:47.423 --> 01:43:50.176
You know, I look at you...

1194
01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.762
I watch you.

1195
01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:56.516
You're never drunk.

1196
01:43:57.538 --> 01:44:00.207
Oh, that's...

1197
01:44:00.395 --> 01:44:03.377
that's real control.

1198
01:44:03.565 --> 01:44:05.942
Control is power.

1199
01:44:06.776 --> 01:44:09.279
That's power.

1200
01:44:12.907 --> 01:44:16.995
Is that why they fear us?

1201
01:44:18.017 --> 01:44:21.749
We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.

1202
01:44:21.937 --> 01:44:25.753
They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.

1203
01:44:25.837 --> 01:44:27.985
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1204
01:44:28.068 --> 01:44:30.717
We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.

1205
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.034
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1206
01:44:36.139 --> 01:44:39.058
That's not power, though.

1207
01:44:39.142 --> 01:44:43.876
That's justice. It's
different than power.

1208
01:44:46.232 --> 01:44:51.404
Power is when we have every
justification to kill...

1209
01:44:51.488 --> 01:44:54.073
and we don't.

1210
01:44:54.157 --> 01:44:56.930
You think that's power?

1211
01:44:58.786 --> 01:45:02.040
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something...

1212
01:45:02.123 --> 01:45:03.687
he's brought in
before the emperor...

1213
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:07.921
he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.

1214
01:45:08.004 --> 01:45:11.549
He knows he's going to die.

1215
01:45:13.468 --> 01:45:17.701
And the emperor, pardons him.

1216
01:45:18.118 --> 01:45:22.331
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1217
01:45:24.854 --> 01:45:27.857
I think you are drunk.

1218
01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.903
That's power, Amon.

1219
01:45:31.986 --> 01:45:35.949
That, is power.

1220
01:45:42.997 --> 01:45:46.918

1221
01:45:48.837 --> 01:45:51.881
I pardon you.

1222
01:45:59.139 --> 01:46:00.244
What do they want?

1223
01:46:00.327 --> 01:46:01.822
I don't know, but they're in my

1224
01:46:01.823 --> 01:46:03.706
office right now
reviewing our books.

1225
01:46:03.789 --> 01:46:07.147
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1226
01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:09.884
that the auditors are
reviewing my books?

1227
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.541
Or have you done
your job properly?

1228
01:46:11.542 --> 01:46:12.652
You needn't be alarmed.

1229
01:46:12.735 --> 01:46:14.946
I needn't be alarmed.

1230
01:46:19.114 --> 01:46:20.114
I'm sorry, sir.

1231
01:46:20.115 --> 01:46:22.308
Do you know how much
this saddle is worth?

1232
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:25.769
Do you know how much it costs?

1233
01:46:29.794 --> 01:46:31.796
All right.

1234
01:46:33.444 --> 01:46:35.550
All right.

1235
01:46:38.887 --> 01:46:42.578
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1236
01:46:51.795 --> 01:46:54.652
Barracks one, eleven...

1237
01:46:54.736 --> 01:46:57.280
fifteen and thirty-two...

1238
01:46:57.363 --> 01:47:00.471
apply to inspection area.

1239
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:32.127
She was smoking on the job.

1240
01:47:34.859 --> 01:47:38.050
Tell her not to do it again.

1241
01:47:53.127 --> 01:47:56.256
I have to report, sir...

1242
01:47:56.652 --> 01:48:01.052
I've been unable to remove the
stains from your bathtub.

1243
01:48:04.305 --> 01:48:08.476
- What are you using, Lisiek?
- Soap, Commander.

1244
01:48:10.374 --> 01:48:13.377
Soap? Not lye?

1245
01:48:22.073 --> 01:48:26.307
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1246
01:48:48.183 --> 01:48:50.873
I pardon you.

1247
01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:45.758
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1248
01:50:45.842 --> 01:50:48.553
I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me...

1249
01:50:48.636 --> 01:50:51.723
if I intone the blessings.

1250
01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:46.486
So...

1251
01:51:47.508 --> 01:51:50.865
this is where you
come to hide from me.

1252
01:51:51.157 --> 01:51:54.494
I came to tell you...

1253
01:51:54.786 --> 01:51:58.154
that you, you really are

1254
01:51:58.155 --> 01:52:01.522
a wonderful cook and a
well-trained servant.

1255
01:52:01.543 --> 01:52:05.964
I mean it. If you need a
reference after the war...

1256
01:52:06.047 --> 01:52:11.365
I'd be, I'd be happy
to give you one.

1257
01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:13.721
It must get lonely
down here when you're.

1258
01:52:13.805 --> 01:52:18.831
Listening to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1259
01:52:25.066 --> 01:52:27.318
Does it?

1260
01:52:29.070 --> 01:52:31.489
You can answer.

1261
01:52:33.408 --> 01:52:37.829
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking:

1262
01:52:37.912 --> 01:52:40.915
"What does he want to hear?"

1263
01:52:46.087 --> 01:52:51.196
The truth, Helen, is
always the right answer.

1264
01:52:52.927 --> 01:52:55.513
Yes, you're right.

1265
01:52:55.597 --> 01:52:59.017
Sometimes we're both lonely.

1266
01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:02.103
Yes. I...

1267
01:53:03.334 --> 01:53:06.399
I mean...

1268
01:53:12.614 --> 01:53:16.034
I would like so much to...

1269
01:53:16.117 --> 01:53:20.663
reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1270
01:53:20.851 --> 01:53:24.834
What would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1271
01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:27.900
what would be wrong with that?

1272
01:53:27.983 --> 01:53:31.716
I realise that you're
not a person in the...

1273
01:53:31.799 --> 01:53:35.970
the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1274
01:53:36.367 --> 01:53:39.641
No, maybe you're right about that
too, you know, maybe what's...

1275
01:53:39.828 --> 01:53:43.228
what's wrong isn't...

1276
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:45.897
it's not us.

1277
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:48.399
It's, no, it's this.

1278
01:53:50.819 --> 01:53:54.969
I mean, when they
compare you to...

1279
01:53:55.052 --> 01:53:59.223
to, vermin and to
rodents and to lice...

1280
01:54:01.955 --> 01:54:04.436
I just...

1281
01:54:07.001 --> 01:54:09.963
No, no, you, you
make a good point.

1282
01:54:10.046 --> 01:54:13.445
You make a very good point.

1283
01:54:20.849 --> 01:54:24.206
Is this the face of a rat?

1284
01:54:26.396 --> 01:54:30.525
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1285
01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:35.321
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1286
01:54:50.253 --> 01:54:55.425
I feel for you, Helen.

1287
01:55:11.253 --> 01:55:14.402
No, I don't think so.

1288
01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:19.219
You're a Jewish bitch.

1289
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:24.996
You nearly talked me
into it, didn't you?

1290
01:55:29.417 --> 01:55:32.003
Bravo.

1291
01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:57.779
- Bravo.
- Cheers. Cheers.

1292
01:56:06.287 --> 01:56:09.478
On behalf of the, of
the workers, sir,

1293
01:56:09.479 --> 01:56:12.669
I wish for you a happy birthday.

1294
01:56:12.752 --> 01:56:14.379
Happy birthday.

1295
01:56:14.462 --> 01:56:15.985
Well, the staff, please.

1296
01:56:16.068 --> 01:56:20.093
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1297
01:56:38.528 --> 01:56:43.012
Thank you very much. Tell
them "Thank you" from me.

1298
01:56:58.235 --> 01:57:02.844
The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

1299
01:57:02.927 --> 01:57:07.077
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1300
01:57:07.161 --> 01:57:11.144
One was marked "Cloak Room"
and the other "Valuables."

1301
01:57:11.227 --> 01:57:13.646
And there they were
made to undress.

1302
01:57:13.730 --> 01:57:15.906
A Jewish boy handed them pieces of

1303
01:57:15.907 --> 01:57:18.276
string to tie their
shoes together.

1304
01:57:18.776 --> 01:57:21.029
They shaved their hair.

1305
01:57:21.112 --> 01:57:23.606
They told them it
was needed to make

1306
01:57:23.607 --> 01:57:26.034
something special
for U-boat crews.

1307
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:30.371
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1308
01:57:30.455 --> 01:57:34.542
to bunkers with Stars of
David on the doors...

1309
01:57:34.626 --> 01:57:38.546
and signs that said "Bath
and Inhalation Room"

1310
01:57:38.630 --> 01:57:40.840
SS gave them soap.

1311
01:57:40.924 --> 01:57:43.916
They told them to
breathe all the time

1312
01:57:43.917 --> 01:57:46.679
because it's good
for disinfecting.

1313
01:57:46.763 --> 01:57:50.079
And then they gassed them.

1314
01:57:50.266 --> 01:57:53.436
Mila, why soaps?

1315
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.417
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1316
01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.584
Come on, Mila, stop
it. Your bedtime

1318
01:57:59.359 --> 01:58:01.820
- I just don't believe it.
- Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1319
01:58:01.903 --> 01:58:03.947
- I don't believe it either.
- I cannot believe it.

1320
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:05.970
I didn't say I believed
it. I said I heard it.

1321
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:07.492
From who?

1322
01:58:07.575 --> 01:58:10.307
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1323
01:58:10.391 --> 01:58:15.062
You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.

1324
01:58:15.333 --> 01:58:18.503
- Yes.
- It doesn't make any sense.

1325
01:58:18.586 --> 01:58:20.672
We're their workforce.

1326
01:58:20.755 --> 01:58:24.509
What sense does it make to
kill your own workforce?

assembling a workforce only to...

1328
01:58:29.597 --> 01:58:32.997
No, it can't be true.

02:05:30.393 --> 02:05:33.313
- Olek?
- Danka?

1376
02:05:33.396 --> 02:05:35.315
- Danka?
- Olek?

1377
02:05:35.398 --> 02:05:38.443
Back to the barracks. Go
back to your barracks.

1378
02:05:39.048 --> 02:05:40.789
I didn't see him.

1379
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:42.530
They're hiding. I'm telling
you, they're hiding.

1380
02:05:42.614 --> 02:05:44.565
I know Danka. She
knows a good place.

1381
02:05:44.566 --> 02:05:46.159
She took all of them together.

1382
02:05:46.242 --> 02:05:48.953
Back to the barracks.

1383
02:06:08.515 --> 02:06:11.273
Find your own hiding
place. There's

1384
02:06:11.274 --> 02:06:14.187
no room for you here.
Go away, quick.

1385
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:41.402
Get out. This is our
place. Get out.

1386
02:07:04.487 --> 02:07:07.824
- Oskar.
- Amon. Gentlemen.

1387
02:07:07.907 --> 02:07:09.133
Why didn't you call me?

1388
02:07:09.134 --> 02:07:11.244
I tried to call you.
Here, Hujar, move.

1389
02:07:11.327 --> 02:07:14.122
- Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch.
- Oskar.

1390
02:07:14.205 --> 02:07:15.690
They're running a
little late, you know?

1391
02:07:15.693 --> 02:07:16.960
It's taking longer than I thought.

1392
02:07:17.041 --> 02:07:19.919
- A drink?
- Something cold. Bowle.

1393
02:07:19.961 --> 02:07:22.589
The Bowle.

1394
02:07:24.257 --> 02:07:26.888

02:07:58.604 --> 02:08:01.503
- To your health.
- Oh, thank you.

1401
02:08:07.383 --> 02:08:10.105
What do you say we get
your fire hoses out

1402
02:08:10.106 --> 02:08:12.639
here and hose down
the cars? Thank you.

1403

Indulge me.

1404
02:08:19.208 --> 02:08:20.959
- Hujar.
- Yes, sir.

1405
02:08:21.043 --> 02:08:25.089
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1406
02:08:28.196 --> 02:08:31.825
In the windows.
That's it, that's it.

1407
02:08:31.908 --> 02:08:34.159
On the roof. That's
it, good, good.

That's it, that's it. More, more.

1412

This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1413
02:08:56.787 --> 02:09:00.562
You shouldn't do
that. That's cruel.

give them water, yeah?

- Okay. This car. This car.

I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1428
02:10:33.863 --> 02:10:38.660
- You should be aware of that.
- We will have to risk regret.

1429
02:10:38.743 --> 02:10:43.102
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1430
02:11:18.408 --> 02:11:20.326
What about you?

1431
02:11:20.410 --> 02:11:23.997
I violated the Race
and Resettlement Act.

1432
02:11:24.184 --> 02:11:28.334
Though I doubt anyone can point
out the actual provision to me.

1433
02:11:28.418 --> 02:11:31.754
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1434
02:11:35.425 --> 02:11:38.344
Did your prick fall off?

1435
02:11:56.905 --> 02:12:00.095
He likes women.

1436
02:12:01.117 --> 02:12:05.225
He likes good-looking women.

1437
02:12:05.872 --> 02:12:10.168
He sees a beautiful
woman, he doesn't think.

1438
02:12:12.712 --> 02:12:15.798
I mean, he has so many women.

1439
02:12:15.882 --> 02:12:18.009
And they love him.

1440
02:12:18.092 --> 02:12:21.095
Yeah, they love him. I mean, he
is married, yeah, but he's...

1441
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:26.309
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1442
02:12:26.392 --> 02:12:30.104
But you didn't see this girl.

1443
02:12:30.188 --> 02:12:33.608
I saw this girl. This
girl was, woof...

1444
02:12:33.691 --> 02:12:35.985
she was very good-looking.

1445
02:12:39.948 --> 02:12:42.429
They cast a spell on
you, you know, the Jews.

1446
02:12:42.513 --> 02:12:44.869
When you work closely with
them, like I do, you see this.

1447
02:12:44.953 --> 02:12:46.831
They have this power.
It's like a virus.

1448

Some of my men are
infected with this virus.

02:12:48.978 --> 02:12:50.191
They should be pitied,
not punished.

1450
02:12:50.192 --> 02:12:51.209
They should receive treatment.

1451
02:12:51.292 --> 02:12:54.295
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1452
02:12:54.379 --> 02:12:57.841

1453
02:12:58.028 --> 02:13:00.635
You're offering me a bribe?

1454
02:13:02.137 --> 02:13:07.767

It's a gratuity.

real taste for Jewish skirt.

was going to say.

- You're not telling me something.

- You know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1542
02:20:12.058 --> 02:20:13.058
Artillery shells.

1543
02:20:13.059 --> 02:20:14.411
Everyone is making
artillery shells.

1544
02:20:14.494 --> 02:20:16.306
- Tank shells, they need that.
- Tanks shells, yeah.

1545
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:18.930
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy, except me.

1546
02:20:19.014 --> 02:20:22.011
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1547
02:20:22.095 --> 02:20:25.094
If I'm making a hundred,
you've got to be making three.

1548
02:20:25.177 --> 02:20:28.551
And if you admit to making three,
then it's four actually. But how?

1549
02:20:28.635 --> 02:20:32.383
- I just told you.
- You did, but you didn't.

1550
02:20:34.486 --> 02:20:36.673
Yeah, all right, don't tell me.

1551
02:20:36.756 --> 02:20:41.004
I'll go along with it. It's just
irritating I can't work it out.

1552
02:20:41.088 --> 02:20:45.835
Look, all you have to do is
tell me what it's worth to you.

1553
02:20:45.919 --> 02:20:48.585
- What's a person worth to you?
- No, no, no, no.

1554
02:20:48.668 --> 02:20:52.146
What's one worth to you?

1555
02:20:59.538 --> 02:21:03.995
Poldek Pfefferberg,
Mila Pfefferberg...

1556
02:21:04.078 --> 02:21:06.620
and...

1557
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:09.076
Stagel, Stagel...

1558
02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.701
- Paul.
- Paul. Paul Stagel.

1559
02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:13.408
Doctor...

1560
02:21:14.637 --> 02:21:17.463
The investors. I want all of them.

1561
02:21:17.464 --> 02:21:18.464
Yes, sir.

1562
02:21:18.490 --> 02:21:21.363
Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1563
02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.486
Fischer, Ismail.

1564
02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:28.152
- Josef Scharf.
- One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1565
02:21:28.235 --> 02:21:30.797
Come on, Stern. Scharf, Scharf.

1566
02:21:33.254 --> 02:21:37.377
The children, all the children.

1567
02:21:41.105 --> 02:21:43.229
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1568
02:21:43.312 --> 02:21:47.873
- How many?
- 400, 450.

1569
02:21:49.893 --> 02:21:52.663
More, more.

1570
02:21:58.056 --> 02:21:59.806
Good morning.

1571
02:22:15.799 --> 02:22:21.130
- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1572
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:30.231
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob,
Nacha. Yes? Nacha.

1573
02:22:30.315 --> 02:22:32.127
Nacha, that's right.

1574
02:22:32.314 --> 02:22:34.147
And Wolf.

1575
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:36.624
How many?

1576
02:22:38.207 --> 02:22:41.893
- 600.
- More.

1577
02:22:43.122 --> 02:22:44.371
You can do the same
thing I'm doing.

1578
02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:47.162
- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

1579
02:22:47.245 --> 02:22:48.733
Come on, Julius, I know about the

1580
02:22:48.734 --> 02:22:50.494
extra food and clothes
you give them.

1581
02:22:50.536 --> 02:22:53.201
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach...

1582
02:22:53.285 --> 02:22:55.554
we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

1583
02:22:55.556 --> 02:22:56.723
- Oskar.
- We could relocate them...

1584
02:22:56.741 --> 02:23:00.240
in something like
safety, in Moravia.

1585
02:23:00.636 --> 02:23:02.469
I don't know.

1586
02:23:04.342 --> 02:23:07.071
How many cigarettes have
you smoked tonight?

1587
02:23:07.072 --> 02:23:08.072
Too many.

1588
02:23:08.091 --> 02:23:12.923
For every one you
smoke, I smoke half.

1589
02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:15.235
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1590
02:23:15.317 --> 02:23:18.608
- No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
- I will not accept that.

1591
02:23:18.691 --> 02:23:20.357
No.

1592
02:23:30.353 --> 02:23:33.102
- How many? How many?
- 850, give or take.

1593
02:23:33.185 --> 02:23:38.058
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1594
02:23:47.638 --> 02:23:51.844
That's it. You can
finish that page.

1595
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:59.883
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1596
02:23:59.966 --> 02:24:04.631
You just told him how many
people you needed and...

1597
02:24:06.922 --> 02:24:09.629
You're not buying them?

1598
02:24:11.545 --> 02:24:14.711
You're buying them? You're paying
him for each of these names?

1599
02:24:14.794 --> 02:24:16.643
If you were still
working for me, I'd

1600
02:24:16.644 --> 02:24:18.251
expect you to talk me out of it.

1601
02:24:18.334 --> 02:24:21.624
It's costing me a fortune.

1602
02:24:22.124 --> 02:24:26.060
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1603
02:24:47.822 --> 02:24:50.071
You...

1604
02:24:55.653 --> 02:24:59.817
The list is an absolute good.

1605
02:24:59.901 --> 02:25:03.253
The list... is life.

1606
02:25:04.316 --> 02:25:09.730
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1607
02:25:09.814 --> 02:25:11.912
Oskar, there's a
clerical error here

1608
02:25:11.913 --> 02:25:13.728
at the bottom of the last page.

1609
02:25:13.811 --> 02:25:16.560
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1610
02:25:16.643 --> 02:25:18.972
I'll never find a maid
as well trained as her

1611
02:25:18.973 --> 02:25:21.100
at Brinnlitz. They are
all country girls.

1612
02:25:22.641 --> 02:25:24.057
No.

1613
02:25:33.054 --> 02:25:34.762
No.

1614
02:25:34.845 --> 02:25:37.032
- One hand of twenty-one.
- No.

1615
02:25:37.115 --> 02:25:39.254
If you win, I pay you
7,400 reichsmarks.

1616
02:25:39.255 --> 02:25:40.255
No.

1617
02:25:40.256 --> 02:25:43.821
- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No.

1618
02:25:43.904 --> 02:25:47.090
If I win, the girl
goes on my list.

1619
02:25:47.277 --> 02:25:49.466
I can't wager Helen
in a card game.

1620
02:25:49.467 --> 02:25:50.467
Why not?

1621
02:25:50.547 --> 02:25:51.609
Wouldn't be right.

1622
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:53.380
She's just going to Auschwitz
Number Two, anyway.

1623
02:25:53.421 --> 02:25:55.670
- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

1624
02:25:55.712 --> 02:25:57.949
I'd never do that
to her. No, I want

1625
02:25:57.950 --> 02:26:00.127
her to come back
to Vienna with me.

1626
02:26:00.210 --> 02:26:03.251
I want her to come to
work for me there.

1627
02:26:03.334 --> 02:26:07.832
- I want to grow old with her.
- Are you mad?

1628
02:26:07.915 --> 02:26:12.111
Amon, you can't take her
to Vienna with you.

1629
02:26:12.112 --> 02:26:14.225
No, of course I can't.

1630
02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:17.203
That's what I'd like to do.

1631
02:26:17.286 --> 02:26:20.183
What I can do, if
I'm any sort of a

1632
02:26:20.184 --> 02:26:23.242
man, is the next
most merciful thing.

1633
02:26:23.326 --> 02:26:25.884
I shall take her into
the woods and shoot

1634
02:26:25.885 --> 02:26:28.323
her painlessly in the
back of the head.

1635
02:26:37.445 --> 02:26:41.860
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1636
02:26:42.048 --> 02:26:44.400
Was it 14,800?

1637
02:26:44.483 --> 02:26:47.920
Jews of Schindler, to these
tables. Say your names clearly.

1638
02:26:47.983 --> 02:26:51.356
- We are the family Dresner.
- Juda, Jonas...

1639
02:26:51.439 --> 02:26:53.814
Donata and Chaja.

1640
02:26:53.897 --> 02:26:57.520
- We are Rosners. Henry, Manci...
- And Leo.

1641
02:26:57.604 --> 02:27:00.998
- And our son.
- I am Olek.

1642
02:27:01.081 --> 02:27:02.581
Maria Mischel.

1643
02:27:02.664 --> 02:27:05.517
Chaim Nowak.

1644
02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:07.954
Wulkan, Markus.

1645
02:27:08.037 --> 02:27:10.410
Michael Lemper.

1646
02:27:11.264 --> 02:27:13.430
Itzhak Stern.

1647
02:27:13.722 --> 02:27:16.804
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1648
02:27:17.304 --> 02:27:19.595
- Rosalia Nussbaum.
- Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1649
02:27:20.094 --> 02:27:22.468
Jakob Levartov.

1650
02:27:23.072 --> 02:27:25.822
- Farber, Rosa.
- Farber, Andrzej.

1651
02:27:25.905 --> 02:27:28.674
- Sara.
- Friehof, Fischel.

1652
02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:31.903
Mietek Pemper.

1653
02:27:31.985 --> 02:27:34.464
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1654
02:27:34.547 --> 02:27:37.046
Horowitz, Dolek.

1655
02:27:38.275 --> 02:27:40.211
Adam Levy.

1656
02:27:40.294 --> 02:27:42.544
Marcel Goldberg.

1657
02:27:42.627 --> 02:27:46.084
Klipstein, Isak David.

1658
02:27:46.167 --> 02:27:48.083
Altmann, Eduard.

1659
02:27:48.167 --> 02:27:50.249
Grunberg, Miriam.

1660
02:27:50.333 --> 02:27:52.415
Luftig, Eliasz.

1661
02:27:52.498 --> 02:27:54.539
Hilmann, Eduard.

1662
02:27:54.622 --> 02:27:56.892
Erna Rothberg.

1663
02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.016
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1664
02:28:00.307 --> 02:28:03.057
Helen Hirsch.

1665
02:28:04.118 --> 02:28:07.263
The worst is over.

1666
02:28:07.763 --> 02:28:11.886
Men to this transport and
women to this transport.

1667
02:28:11.970 --> 02:28:16.842
Be careful. Men to this transport
and women to this transport.

1668
02:28:16.926 --> 02:28:19.493
Watch your step. Men
to this transport

1669
02:28:19.494 --> 02:28:21.403
and women to this transport.

1670
02:28:59.367 --> 02:29:03.886
Wonderful Olek, wonderful.

1671
02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:08.717
You know how we make
ice into water?

1672
02:29:09.425 --> 02:29:11.674
Olek, get another one.

1673
02:29:49.951 --> 02:29:53.159
Position yourselves
all in a single row.

1674
02:29:53.345 --> 02:29:55.717
You'll be pleased
with the level of

1675
02:29:55.718 --> 02:29:58.156
efficiency I get
from these workers.

1676
02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:01.675
Budzyn, under my command...

1677
02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:02.942
was the envy of every other

1678
02:30:02.943 --> 02:30:04.653
commandant in the
labour camp system.

1679
02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:06.236
- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me.

1680
02:30:06.278 --> 02:30:09.485
They would have rather
been somewhere else.

1681
02:30:23.479 --> 02:30:26.790
The train with the women has
already left Plaszow...

1682
02:30:26.874 --> 02:30:30.643
and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1683
02:30:30.726 --> 02:30:33.433
I know you've had a long journey.

1684
02:30:33.517 --> 02:30:36.766
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1685
02:30:36.849 --> 02:30:42.264
where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1686
02:30:42.346 --> 02:30:44.950
Welcome to Brinnlitz.

1687
02:30:54.362 --> 02:30:57.382
- Beans in chunt?
- Beans are the best part.

1688
02:30:57.466 --> 02:30:59.715
I don't like beans.

1689
02:30:59.798 --> 02:31:03.672
Beans and meat and
potatoes and bread.

1690
02:31:03.755 --> 02:31:06.650
That's not the way you make chunt.

1691
02:31:10.398 --> 02:31:13.625
- Eggs in chunt?
- Yes.

1692
02:31:15.812 --> 02:31:18.666
- I don't like chunt.
- No, you don't.

1693
02:31:18.708 --> 02:31:23.830
- What do you like?
- I like caviar.

1694
02:31:23.914 --> 02:31:25.330
One day on the fire...

1695
02:31:25.331 --> 02:31:27.413
- Oh, yes.
- One day...

1696
02:32:32.573 --> 02:32:34.469
Position yourselves in
front of the waggons.

1697
02:32:36.010 --> 02:32:39.341
You've got to stay together.

1698
02:32:39.425 --> 02:32:43.715
Leave the waggons.
Leave the waggons.

1699
02:32:44.631 --> 02:32:46.984
I said, leave the waggons.

1700
02:32:48.338 --> 02:32:50.754
Bagaze zostawic.

1701
02:32:53.086 --> 02:32:55.169
Faster. Quick. Quick.

1702
02:32:55.252 --> 02:32:57.501
What's going on back there?

1703
02:33:00.083 --> 02:33:01.999
Move it.

1704
02:33:06.789 --> 02:33:10.662
Come on, out. Hurry up, out.

1705
02:33:10.704 --> 02:33:16.952
Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five...

1706
02:33:17.034 --> 02:33:18.951
Out.

1707
02:33:19.034 --> 02:33:21.450
Get out.

1708
02:33:21.533 --> 02:33:24.449
Quicker, get out.

1709
02:33:28.156 --> 02:33:30.800
All of you, out.

1710
02:33:31.717 --> 02:33:35.465
- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?

1711
02:33:38.381 --> 02:33:40.026
Move the line.

1712
02:33:40.525 --> 02:33:42.524
Get out.

1713
02:33:47.273 --> 02:33:50.646
- Quick. Get out.
- Faster.

1714
02:33:53.229 --> 02:33:55.269
Quicker.

1715
02:33:55.311 --> 02:33:57.685
Come on, be quick.

1716
02:33:57.727 --> 02:34:01.225
Mama, where are we?

1717
02:34:02.329 --> 02:34:05.516
- 17, 18, 20...
- They're in Auschwitz.

1718
02:34:05.599 --> 02:34:09.556
The train was never routed
here. A paperwork mistake.

1719
02:34:17.885 --> 02:34:20.301
Take off your shoes.

1720
02:34:33.213 --> 02:34:36.129
Quicker, quicker.

1721
02:34:39.523 --> 02:34:41.043
Take off your clothes. Hurry up.

1722
02:34:41.126 --> 02:34:43.792
Hurry up. Stay in a row and
take off your clothes.

1723
02:34:45.333 --> 02:34:47.040
Quicker.

1724
02:35:01.784 --> 02:35:04.741
Quicker.

1725
02:35:04.825 --> 02:35:08.074
Take off your clothes
quickly. Hurry up.

1726
02:35:15.237 --> 02:35:17.175
Go in, hurry up.

1727
02:35:20.153 --> 02:35:21.652
Quicker.

1728
02:35:21.736 --> 02:35:24.526
Go to the showers, quickly.

1729
02:35:26.608 --> 02:35:30.814
Quicker. Quicker.

1730
02:38:00.797 --> 02:38:02.670
Eyes on the necks.

1731
02:38:05.377 --> 02:38:08.169
Hands on the shoulders.

1732
02:38:08.210 --> 02:38:11.417
- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight.

1733
02:38:11.458 --> 02:38:14.208
Cough for me, mother.

1734
02:38:14.209 --> 02:38:16.957
They say to fall against
the fence is a kindness.

1735
02:38:17.249 --> 02:38:19.747
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1736
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:23.704
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1737
02:38:25.557 --> 02:38:28.077
- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir.

1738
02:38:28.161 --> 02:38:30.368
- Sir?
- Good morning.

1739
02:38:30.451 --> 02:38:33.409
A mistake has been made. We
are not supposed to be here.

1740
02:38:33.492 --> 02:38:37.240
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

1741
02:38:37.324 --> 02:38:40.780
- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow.

1742
02:38:40.864 --> 02:38:45.237
- Enamelware.
- A pot maker.

1743
02:38:45.736 --> 02:38:47.902
How old are you, mother?

1744
02:38:52.109 --> 02:38:57.919
You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour...

1745
02:38:58.107 --> 02:39:00.398
Mr Schindler.

1746
02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:03.355
I remember earlier this
year, IG Farben ordered...

1747
02:39:03.437 --> 02:39:09.228
a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

1748
02:39:09.311 --> 02:39:13.225
The train came in
through the archway...

1749
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:15.842
and the officer in charge of the

1750
02:39:15.843 --> 02:39:18.932
selection went
immediately to work...

1751
02:39:19.015 --> 02:39:21.722
and sent 2,000 of them...

1752
02:39:21.764 --> 02:39:25.346
straight away to
"special treatment".

1753
02:39:26.054 --> 02:39:28.952
It is not my task to
interfere with the

1754
02:39:28.953 --> 02:39:31.635
processes that take
place down here.

1755
02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:37.882
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?

1756
02:39:37.966 --> 02:39:41.277
Allow me to express the reason.

1757
02:39:49.711 --> 02:39:53.210
I'm not making any
judgement about you.

1758
02:39:53.251 --> 02:39:55.792
It's just that I know that
in the coming months...

1759
02:39:55.834 --> 02:39:59.624
we're all going to
need portable wealth.

1760
02:40:02.268 --> 02:40:04.976
I could have you arrested.

1761
02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:10.328
I'm protected by powerful
friends. You should know that.

1762
02:40:12.702 --> 02:40:16.617
I do not say I am accepting them.

1763
02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:21.990
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1764
02:40:35.547 --> 02:40:38.733
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1765
02:40:38.816 --> 02:40:41.190
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1766
02:40:41.274 --> 02:40:45.231
New ones. These are fresh.

1767
02:40:48.938 --> 02:40:51.713
The train comes,
we turn it around.

1768
02:40:51.714 --> 02:40:52.956
Yes, yes, yes.

1769
02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:54.560
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1770
02:40:54.956 --> 02:40:57.726
I want these.

1771
02:41:00.245 --> 02:41:03.910
You shouldn't get stuck on names.

1772
02:41:10.637 --> 02:41:14.886
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

1773
02:41:14.969 --> 02:41:18.967
Zoldinger, Ernestina.
Waldergrun, Hilda.

1774
02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:21.258
Waldergrun, Leonora.

1775
02:41:21.341 --> 02:41:24.714
Laast, Anna. Pfefferberg, Mila.

1776
02:41:24.798 --> 02:41:28.339
Dresner, Ruth. Dresner, Danka.

1777
02:41:28.422 --> 02:41:32.129
Nussbaum, Sidonia. Rosner, Manci.

1778
02:41:32.211 --> 02:41:38.209
Hirsch, Helen. Grosz, Chaja
Sara. Seelenfreund, Estella.

1779
02:41:53.036 --> 02:41:55.203
Move it. Move it, quick.

1780
02:41:55.285 --> 02:41:59.825
- Faster. Faster.
- Come on.

1781
02:42:01.492 --> 02:42:04.365
Quick, quick. Faster.

1782
02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.321
- Faster.
- Hurry up.

1783
02:42:18.610 --> 02:42:21.692
No. No. No.

1784
02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:39.768
No. No. No.

1785
02:42:43.434 --> 02:42:45.724
No. No. No.

1786
02:42:47.807 --> 02:42:51.763
Hey. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

1787
02:42:51.846 --> 02:42:53.895
These are mine. These are my

1788
02:42:53.896 --> 02:42:56.678
workers. They should
be on my train.

1789
02:42:56.761 --> 02:42:59.385
They're skilled munitions
workers. They're essential.

1790
02:43:00.093 --> 02:43:02.676
Essential girls.

1791
02:43:04.841 --> 02:43:09.235
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1792
02:43:09.319 --> 02:43:12.713
How else am I to polish the inside
of a 45 millimetre shell casing?

1793
02:43:12.796 --> 02:43:16.628
You tell me. You tell me.

1794
02:43:18.065 --> 02:43:22.231
Back on the train.
Back on the train.

1795
02:45:16.351 --> 02:45:20.578
Under Department "W" provisions...

1796
02:45:20.662 --> 02:45:25.035
it is unlawful to kill a
worker without just cause.

1797
02:45:25.118 --> 02:45:28.117
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund...

1798
02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:32.490
I am entitled to file damage
claims for such deaths.

1799
02:45:32.573 --> 02:45:35.531
If you shoot without thinking...

1800
02:45:35.614 --> 02:45:39.904
you go to prison, I get paid.

1801
02:45:39.987 --> 02:45:42.278
That's how it works.

1802
02:45:42.361 --> 02:45:47.526
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1803
02:45:48.317 --> 02:45:53.066
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1804
02:45:53.149 --> 02:45:55.720
In hopes of ensuring
that, guards will no

1805
02:45:55.721 --> 02:45:58.293
longer be allowed on
the factory floor...

1806
02:45:58.376 --> 02:46:02.042
without my authorisation.

1807
02:46:06.810 --> 02:46:11.558
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1808
02:46:12.204 --> 02:46:14.349
Come on, come.

1809
02:46:14.952 --> 02:46:17.035
Oh, boy. I haven't seen something
like that since years.

1810
02:46:17.118 --> 02:46:19.972
Come on, boys, come.

1811
02:46:45.628 --> 02:46:51.563
No doorman or maitre d' will
ever mistake you again...

1812
02:46:51.646 --> 02:46:54.000
I promise.

1813
02:47:00.664 --> 02:47:02.825
This is Itzhak Stern,
my accountant.

1814
02:47:02.826 --> 02:47:04.433
You must be Mrs Schindler.

1815
02:47:04.475 --> 02:47:05.797
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1816
02:47:05.798 --> 02:47:07.332
Emilie has volunteered
to work in the clinic.

1817
02:47:07.334 --> 02:47:09.118
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

1818
02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:11.826
We need to talk when
you have a moment.

1819
02:47:11.909 --> 02:47:14.491
This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.

1820
02:47:14.574 --> 02:47:17.577
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1821
02:47:17.578 --> 02:47:18.578
- Madam.
- Hello.

1822
02:47:18.635 --> 02:47:19.635
What is it?

1823
02:47:19.636 --> 02:47:22.363
We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1824
02:47:22.447 --> 02:47:24.613
The artillery shells, tank
shells, rocket casings.

1825
02:47:24.696 --> 02:47:27.361
Apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.

1826
02:47:27.362 --> 02:47:28.404
That's to be expected.

1827
02:47:28.485 --> 02:47:30.198
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and

1828
02:47:30.199 --> 02:47:31.693
pans. This is a precise business.

1829
02:47:31.776 --> 02:47:33.733
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

1830
02:47:33.775 --> 02:47:35.810
Sure, so would I, so
would you. I wouldn't

1831
02:47:35.811 --> 02:47:37.941
worry. We'll get it right
one of these days.

1832
02:47:37.982 --> 02:47:40.115
There's a rumour you've been going

1833
02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.439
around miscalibrating
the machines.

1834
02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:47.228
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1835
02:47:47.953 --> 02:47:50.319
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1836
02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:52.414
- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference...

1837
02:47:52.415 --> 02:47:54.036
whether they're made
here or somewhere else.

1838
02:47:54.038 --> 02:47:55.572
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

1839
02:47:55.574 --> 02:47:56.808
You'll lose a lot of money.

1840
02:47:56.891 --> 02:48:00.182
Fewer shells will be made. Stern,
if this factory ever produces...

1841
02:48:00.265 --> 02:48:05.637
a shell that can actually be
fired, I'll be very unhappy.

1842
02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:08.761
- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

1843
02:48:22.172 --> 02:48:26.712
How are you doing, Rabbi? Rabbi.

1844
02:48:28.878 --> 02:48:31.628
Good, Mr Director.

1845
02:48:32.793 --> 02:48:35.042
Sun's going down.

1846
02:48:37.292 --> 02:48:39.395
Yes, it is.

1847
02:48:40.623 --> 02:48:44.705
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1848
02:48:44.789 --> 02:48:46.767
Is it?

1849
02:48:50.203 --> 02:48:52.447
What's the matter with you? You

1850
02:48:52.448 --> 02:48:55.201
should be preparing
for the Sabbath.

1851
02:48:55.285 --> 02:48:58.137
Shouldn't you?

1852
02:49:04.156 --> 02:49:09.258
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come.

1853
02:50:23.791 --> 02:50:26.873
What?

1854
02:50:26.955 --> 02:50:31.871
Do you have any money,
hidden away some place...

1855
02:50:31.954 --> 02:50:35.119
that I don't know about?

1856
02:50:38.077 --> 02:50:40.575
No.

1857
02:50:44.886 --> 02:50:48.905
Why? Am I broke?

1858
02:50:51.883 --> 02:50:54.028
Well...

1859
02:50:54.945 --> 02:51:01.317
Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m...

1860
02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:05.357
at General Eisenhower's
headquarters...

1861
02:51:05.441 --> 02:51:08.148
General Jodl...

1862
02:51:08.231 --> 02:51:12.333
signed the Act of
Unconditional Surrender...

1863
02:51:12.416 --> 02:51:18.435
of all German land, sea and
air forces in Europe...

1864
02:51:18.518 --> 02:51:22.601
to the Allied Expeditionary Force.

1865
02:51:22.642 --> 02:51:26.807
And simultaneously to the
Soviet High Command.

1866
02:51:27.515 --> 02:51:31.305
The German war is,
therefore, at an end.

1867
02:51:31.389 --> 02:51:33.387
But let us not forget
for a moment...

1868
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:37.719
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1869
02:51:37.802 --> 02:51:40.968
Japan, with all her
treachery and greed...

1870
02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:47.049
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.

1871
02:51:47.132 --> 02:51:51.776
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1872
02:51:53.672 --> 02:51:56.045
Tomorrow you'll begin
the process...

1873
02:51:56.128 --> 02:51:59.856
of looking for survivors
of your families.

1874
02:52:02.293 --> 02:52:07.770
In most cases, you
won't find them.

1875
02:52:08.936 --> 02:52:11.747
After six long years of murder...

1876
02:52:11.872 --> 02:52:17.204
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1877
02:52:17.287 --> 02:52:20.411
We've survived.

1878
02:52:20.453 --> 02:52:24.701
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1879
02:52:26.700 --> 02:52:28.865
Thank yourselves.

1880
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:33.364
Thank your fearless Stern...

1881
02:52:33.405 --> 02:52:35.780
and others among you who
worried about you...

1882
02:52:35.821 --> 02:52:39.861
and faced death at every moment.

1883
02:52:42.798 --> 02:52:45.442
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1884
02:52:45.567 --> 02:52:48.836
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1885
02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:51.315
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

1886
02:52:51.398 --> 02:52:55.105
I am a criminal.

1887
02:52:55.189 --> 02:53:00.207
At midnight you'll be
free, and I'll be hunted.

1888
02:53:00.811 --> 02:53:04.310
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight...

1889
02:53:04.393 --> 02:53:06.486
after which time,

1890
02:53:06.487 --> 02:53:10.661
and I hope you'll forgive
me I have to flee.

1891
02:53:12.785 --> 02:53:16.513
I know you have received
orders from our commandant...

1892
02:53:16.596 --> 02:53:19.076
which he has received
from his superiors

1893
02:53:19.077 --> 02:53:21.678
to dispose of the
population of this camp.

1894
02:53:21.761 --> 02:53:24.135
Now would be the time to do it.

1895
02:53:24.219 --> 02:53:30.195
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1896
02:53:34.297 --> 02:53:38.004
Or you could leave...

1897
02:53:38.088 --> 02:53:40.399
and return to your
families as men...

1898
02:53:40.483 --> 02:53:44.377
instead of murderers.

1899
02:54:24.507 --> 02:54:28.672
In memory of the countless
victims among your people...

1900
02:54:28.755 --> 02:54:32.940
I ask us to observe three
minutes of silence.

1901
02:55:27.544 --> 02:55:32.750
- Thank you, Mr Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr Jereth.

1902
02:55:32.834 --> 02:55:35.208
Open wide.

1903
02:55:36.873 --> 02:55:38.977
Thank you, Mr Jereth.

1904
02:55:57.491 --> 02:55:59.781
Thank you, Mr Jereth.

1905
02:56:23.771 --> 02:56:28.083
As soon as peace occurs, I want...

1906
02:56:28.166 --> 02:56:32.289
I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1907
02:56:32.325 --> 02:56:34.912
Two and a half metres each.

1908
02:56:34.996 --> 02:56:38.182
Also, each person is to
get a bottle of vodka.

1909
02:56:38.266 --> 02:56:41.285
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1910
02:56:41.369 --> 02:56:44.846
Likewise those Egipshi
cigarettes we organised.

1911
02:56:44.930 --> 02:56:49.157
It'll be done. Everything you ask.

1912
02:57:08.254 --> 02:57:12.523
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1913
02:57:12.606 --> 02:57:15.772
in case you are captured.

1914
02:57:17.084 --> 02:57:20.269
Every worker has signed it.

1915
02:57:30.307 --> 02:57:32.223
Thank you.

1916
02:57:59.004 --> 02:58:01.315
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1917
02:58:01.399 --> 02:58:07.459
It says: "Whoever saves one
life, saves the world entire."

1918
02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:49.796
I could have got more out.

1919
02:58:50.984 --> 02:58:53.482
I could have got
more. I don't know.

1920
02:58:54.086 --> 02:58:55.877
If I just...

1921
02:58:57.001 --> 02:58:58.106
I could have got more.

1922
02:58:58.189 --> 02:59:01.000
Oskar, there are
1,100 people who are

1923
02:59:01.001 --> 02:59:03.665
alive because of
you. Look at them.

1924
02:59:04.062 --> 02:59:06.540
If I'd made more money...

1925
02:59:10.538 --> 02:59:15.370
I threw away so much money.

1926
02:59:17.327 --> 02:59:20.347
You have no idea.

1927
02:59:20.430 --> 02:59:21.430
If I had just...

1928
02:59:22.491 --> 02:59:26.699
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1929
02:59:27.927 --> 02:59:30.301
I didn't do enough.

1930
02:59:30.385 --> 02:59:33.321
You did so much.

1931
02:59:36.757 --> 02:59:39.214
This car...

1932
02:59:39.298 --> 02:59:41.027
Goeth would've bought this car.

1933
02:59:41.526 --> 02:59:46.275
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1934
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:51.605
Ten people.

1935
02:59:52.313 --> 02:59:55.125
Ten more people.

1936
02:59:56.957 --> 02:59:58.477
This pin...

1937
02:59:58.561 --> 03:00:02.309
two people.

1938
03:00:03.017 --> 03:00:04.788
This is gold.

1939
03:00:04.871 --> 03:00:06.474
Two more people.

1940
03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:09.723
He would have given me two
for it, at least one.

1941
03:00:09.807 --> 03:00:13.180
He would have given
me one, one more.

1942
03:00:15.637 --> 03:00:18.407
One more person.

1943
03:00:20.052 --> 03:00:25.446
A person, Stern, for this.

1944
03:00:27.382 --> 03:00:31.298
I could have gotten...

1945
03:00:31.381 --> 03:00:36.170
one more person and I didn't.

1946
03:00:36.671 --> 03:00:40.127
And I didn't.

1947
03:02:08.509 --> 03:02:11.279
You have been liberated...

1948
03:02:11.361 --> 03:02:14.631
by the Soviet Army.

1949
03:02:22.066 --> 03:02:24.232
Have you been in Poland?

1950
03:02:24.316 --> 03:02:27.793
I just came from Poland.

1951
03:02:28.521 --> 03:02:31.229
Are there any Jews left?

1952
03:02:36.289 --> 03:02:38.831
Where should we go?

1953
03:02:38.913 --> 03:02:40.996
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1954
03:02:41.079 --> 03:02:44.286
They hate you there.

1955
03:02:44.682 --> 03:02:48.534
I wouldn't go west
either, if I were you.

1956
03:02:49.451 --> 03:02:52.574
We could use some food.

1957
03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:58.301
Isn't there a town over there?
