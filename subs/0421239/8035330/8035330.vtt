00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.493
{\an8} Let's go.

2
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.302
{\an8} Taylor. Bob and Marianne Taylor.

3
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.845
{\an8} Bear with me one second.

4
00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.723
<font color="Chocolate">MARIANNE</font>: There are other hotels in Miami.
- I'm really sorry.

5
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.141
What is the problem here?

6
00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.601
We made these reservations
over six months ago.

7
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.229
- I know ma'am, I'm just not seeing it.
- Where's Lisa?

8
00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.647
Lisa always takes care of us.

9
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.982
I know ma'am. She's out of town.

10
00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.859
- Her grandmother passed away.
- Cynthia is it?

11
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:31.818
<font color="Chocolate">CYNTHIA</font>: Yes sir.

12
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.236
Would you get in more trouble

13
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.947
if you bothered her
or if I called corporate?

14
00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.158
Okay.

15
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.163
 Damn! Dallas drivers!

16
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.998
Who taught you how to drive?
Stevie Wonder?

17
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.082
<i>[cell phone rings]</i>

18
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.793
- You'll catch your plane. You got...
- Ten minutes.

19
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.505
- Lisa Reisert.
- Lisa? Hi.

20
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.051
I'm so sorry to call, but I didn't know
what to do. I have a situation.

22
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.677
Slow down. What's the problem?

23
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.304
Bob and Marianne Taylor.

24
00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.014
Yep. They're regulars.

25
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.892
Yeah, well, I think I sort of
erased their reservation.

26
00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.935
I was never checked out
on this new system.

27
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.814
Did I mention I had a confirmed
reservation? This is my receipt.

28
00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.233
I downloaded it
off the internet myself.

29
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.236
- I know, Mrs. Taylor, just calm down.
- No no no! Don't say that. No...

30
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.155
- Calm down?
- She told me to calm down.

31
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:21.534
Don't tell us to calm down.
We've been very calm right up until now.

32
00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.996
- I'm so sorry. Lisa?
- Cynthia, tell them one more minute,

33
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.331
they'll be happy, you promise.

34
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:27.832
One more minute.
You'll be happy.

35
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.626
- I promise.
- We better be.

36
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.962
- Now, enter my PIN. It's 7- 8- 8... Hang on.

37
00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.173
- Dad? Hold on.
-  <i>Lisa?</i>

38
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.591
- Can you hold on?
- <i>Sure.</i>

39
00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:40.553
- Okay, it's 7- 8- 8- 4- underscore- L- Reisert.

40
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.014
Lisa, I'm so sorry
for calling.

41
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.224
No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

42
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.142
- Are you logged in yet?
- Yeah. What do I do?

43
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.729
Okay. You wanna click on the Crisis folder,
you'll see a list of empty rooms,

44
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.482
give 'em fourth floor corner by the gym
and comp 'em for tonight and tomorrow.

45
00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:57.070
Okay, just a sec.
Okay, you are all set.

46
00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.406
The first two nights
are gonna be on us.

47
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.158
And if you need anything else,
just let me know.

48
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.119
We won't.

49
00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.703
<font color="Chocolate">MARIANNE</font>: This is not my fault.

50
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:09.124
God, they totally threw me.
They were such assholes.

51
00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:12.460
Cynthia, there are no guests who are assholes.
Only guests with special needs.

52
00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.879
- [driver] Here we are.
- Keep it. Anything else?

53
00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.633
<font color="Chocolate">CYNTHIA</font>: <i>The Simpsons didn't get
the California King they requested.</i>

54

55
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.304
- Oh, my God.
- <font color="Chocolate">LISA</font>: <i>Tell me.</i>

56
00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:26.391
Security just left a message
saying that the Charles Keefe party

57
00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.768
<i>will be arriving
at 5:30am instead of pm.</i>

58
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.604
That's not that unusual.
Uh, it's a security thing.

59
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.358
Just make sure our guys have the entrance set,
his own security will take it from there.

60
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:37.819
Is Mr. Keefe Platinum Club
or something...?

61
00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.612
<font color="Chocolate">LISA</font>: <i>He's political.
Homeland Security.</i>

62
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.407
Make sure there's a box of
Montecristo Cubans in the room

63
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.660
and a bottle of Cristal
on ice. It's 3825.

64
00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:48.246
- Okay. Got it covered. Safe flight.
- Thanks.

67
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.043
- Lisa Reisert.

68
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.587
I'm still here.

69
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.213
Dad, I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.633
- It's fine, sweetie.
- What's up?

71
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.761
<i>Oh, just gearin' up for another sleepless night
with a comedy marathon.</i>

72
00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.638
Mmm. Before I forget,

73
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.892
that book I gave you,
you finish it yet?

74
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.518
Uh... almost.

75
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.770
You know, he's from Texas.

76
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.481
I didn't think shrinks
came from there.

77
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.734
Yeah, they do. They just move
to California and start TV shows.

78
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.278
- How's the remodeling going?
- Good! Good. Good.

79
00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.405
They made some headway
in the last few days.

80
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.866
I lost my wallet,
but that's par for the course.

81
00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.577
<i>- It's lookin' good.
- That's good. I can't wait to see it.</i>

82
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.456
You should. The upstairs hallway
is totally unrecognizable.

83
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.000
Your room hasn't been touched ofcourse.

84
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.084
<i>No, Dad.</i>

85
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.254
Please, go nuts, make it
into a gym or a putting green.

86
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.715
You know I can't do that.

87
00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:44.344
You never know when you might just
wanna spend a few nights back here.

88
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.223
You know? Make an escape
from the day- to- day.

89
00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.642
Day- to- day, it's where
I thrive, yeah. You know that.

90
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.145
Right.

91
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:56.064
So...

92
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:01.194
- how's your mom holdin' up?
- [sighs] As good as can be expected.

93
00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:03.863
And you? What about you?
You all right?

94
00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.157
- Yep, I'm fine.
- You sure?

95
00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.035
Everything's fine, Dad.

96
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.621
<i>You just gonna have to start
takin' my word for it.</i>

97
00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.581
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta check in.

98
00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.750
You sure you
don't need a pickup?

99
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.752
I thought you lost
your wallet.

100
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.963
Liz, it's just five minutes.

101
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.382
<i>I'm taking the red- eye.
It's the last flight out.</i>

102
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.884
It's gonna be way too late.
I love you. I'll call you tomorrow.

103
00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.679
- I love you too, sweetie.
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>

104

105
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.311
[over PA] <i>Attention please.
We have a cancellation update.</i>

106

<i>Flight 1192 to Pittsburgh has been
canceled due to weather.</i>

<i>[groans]</i>

108
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.444
Anybody who was scheduled on the flight
to Atlanta that was cancelled?

109
00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.197
Come to the front of the line
so we can reroute you.

110

111
00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.158
 Oh!

112
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.786
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't sweat it.

113
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:53.538
I'm wearing
my combat boots.

114
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.872
[music plays in headphones]

115
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.542
- Excuse me?
- Travel is war these days.

116
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.043
Oh. Yeah.

117
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.338
Oh. I just love him.

118
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.215
How is that?
Are you learning a lot?

119
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.759
I'm not really sure.

120
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.220
[chuckles]
He's so handsome.

121
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.223
I work during the day
so I always miss his shows.

122


123
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.396
- Here. That'll catch you up.
- Oh, no. No, no, I... I couldn't.

124
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.983
I'm finished. My dad's given me so many,
I could start a library. Please.

125
00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.570
- That's very nice of you.
- Once again! Anyone who is scheduled

126
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.823
on the flight to Atlanta,
if you wanna get out of Dallas tonight,

127
00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:31.534
come to the front
of the line at this time.

128
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.621
Excuse me.
You're letting them go,

129
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.998
but we've been standing here
for over an hour? How does that happen?

130
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.208
Sir, if we don't re-book them,
they'll miss their flight.

131
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.712
Oh, so it doesn't matter that you cancelled
my first flight, and then rerouted me twice.

132
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.757
- I understand.
- Just get your boss. This is ridiculous!

133
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.468
Sir, please don't make her do that.
She's doing the best she can.

134
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.428
I don't think
I was talking to you

135
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:52.221
- No, I realize that...
- Listen, I'm just trying to get...

136
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.306
Please, sir.

137
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:57.560
Um, she is the only one standing between us
getting out of here at all and total anarchy.

138
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.189
- Yeah, but she's not the one in...
- She's exhausted, she has worked 18 hours straight,

139
00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.983
and she suspects we all hate
her just as much as you do.

140
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.944
What do you say we give her a break?
Let her get back to a job

141
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.989
I'm guessing is a lot
more thankless than yours.

142
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.120
This airline sucks.

143
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:23.169
- Next in line, please.
- Oh. That's me.

144
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.464
Oh! Here.

145
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:30.176
Oh. Thank you very much.
And thank you.

146
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.594
You're welcome.

147
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.638
Yeah. Thank you.

148
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.557
Not at all.
That was just backup.

149
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.060
- You got the ball rolling.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:41.354
- Reflex, I guess.
- Why is that?

151
00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:44.982
I work in a hotel. I deal with
people like that all the time.

152
00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.528
Oh. Uh...
The Marriott? The Hilton?

153
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.738
- The Lux Atlantic. It's in...
- Miami.

154
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.824
- Right. I know it well.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:56.577
- So you're on this...
- Very delayed flight to Miami. Yeah.

156
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.414
- You?
- Yeah. Sadly, yeah.

157
00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.667
But you know what?
That's why God created the Tex- Mex.

158
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.837
The best nachos in the airport
and right across from our gate.

159
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.090
Good tip. Thanks.

160
00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:15.513
- Save you a seat.
- Oh. Uh...

161
00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.226
Yeah, you know that was... I just thought
since we're on the same flight...

162
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.437
I didn't mean to invade
your personal space or...

163
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.856
- No.
- I can take you over here.

164
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.275
I just... I have
a few calls to make.

165
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.402
Sure. I understand.
You go ahead.

166
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:32.238
- Have a good flight.
- Okay. You too.

169
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.538
- Hi.
- Hi. You must be Rebecca.

170
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.206
- Yes.
- Well, my name's Mary,

171
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.334
and I hear this is the first time
you're flying by yourself.

172
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.836
Well, you must
be very brave.

173
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.714
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, Mom.

174
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:52.049
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

175
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.553
- [mother] I'm just asking.
- <font color="Chocolate">REBECCA</font>: I'm 11, not nine.

176
00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:57.054
<font color="Chocolate">MARY</font>: Come with me,
you two.

177
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.684
There you go, sir. Your nachos.
Careful, hot plate.

178
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.311
[waiter] Thank you, sir.

179
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.148
- Oh!
- Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

180
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.400
- It's iced. Don't worry.
- Okay.

181
00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.195
- Let me find you napkins.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

182
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.988
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Uh...

183
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.907
Okay. Larry,

184
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.785
could you run back to Starbucks?
I need another mocha.

185
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:19.911
 Finish that one?

186
00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.370
 Someone's wearin' it.




193
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.411
- Oh. Hi.

194
00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.913
Uh...

195
00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.707
- Is this taken?
- No, it's all yours.

196
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.251
Thanks.

197
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:11.087
So, uh, did you
get your calls made?

198
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.965
Yep. No more calls.

199
00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:16.175
Good. What will you have?

200
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:21.055
- Um... No, it's... I'm okay.
- If I can guess...

201
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.516
Okay.

202
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:24.934
Um...

203
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.769
I'm feeling vodka.

204
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.065
Definitely sweetened. Um...

205
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:36.279
- Cosmo. Way too common. Um...
- Mmm...

206
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.780
Screwdriver.

207
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.867
No. No. No.
Way too boring.

208
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.953
So that leaves me with the
simplicity of the grapefruit

209
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.373
or the complexity
of the pineapple.

210
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.168
Grapefruit sea breeze.

211
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:55.965
Uh, could I have a bay breeze?

212
00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.258
[waiter] You got it.

213
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.761
Thanks. It's an impressive
talent, though. Very close.

214
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.890
- You know, breaks the ice.
- Yeah.

215
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.559
- So are you headed home?
- Yeah. Trying.

216
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.519
Yeah. Flying's so
much fun these days.

217
00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.148
Fun for me is just getting off
that plane in one piece.

218
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:15.776
- Oh. Fear of flying?
- Yeah. Just a little.

219
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.820
Were you in Texas
on hotel business?

220
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.364
No. My grandmother died.

221
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.449
Oh.

222
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.410
It's okay. She was 91.

223
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.996
- Ninety- one.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.457
That's respectable.
What was her secret?

225
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.418
Grape- Nuts.
And a guy named Duke.

226
00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.503
Excuse me?

227
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.549
Yeah, she said the Grape- Nuts
kept her arteries clean

228
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:43.012
and Duke helped
with the rest.

229
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.183
Wow. A dynamic woman.

230
00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.978
Nothing fazed her, you know?
She was so optimistic.

231
00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.148
"Always look forward."

232
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:55.524
That's what she'd say.

233
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.903
- There ya go.
- Thanks.

I say I'm fine,

238

I'm sure.

239
00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:15.920
- Okay, I believe you.
- Good.

240
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:19.090
- The name's Jackson, by the way.
- Lisa.

241
00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:21.384
- Pleased to meet you.
- Is it Jack for short?

242
00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:25.054
No, I haven't gone by Jack
since I was ten years old.

243
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.932
Last name's Rippner.

244

Jack Rippner.

245
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:33.104
Jack... the... Oh.

246
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.772
- There you go.
- Okay.

247
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.274
- That wasn't nice of your parents.
- No.

248
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.819
That's what I told 'em
before I killed 'em.

249
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.488
What?

250
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.659
Well, if it's any comfort,
my middle name's Henrietta.

Henrietta.

252
00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.788

grandma's name, though.

stalking me, are you?

- I'm sorry.

334

- Oh, jeez.
- You all right?

335
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.672
If I say yes, are you
gonna ask me if I'm sure?

No. No.
That's your dad's department.

some cheap wine at the funeral,

339
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.267

with the cheap vodka...

340
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.561

- I blame you for that part.

341
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:27.648
- Well, I feel terrible now.
- You should.

342
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.233
Oh, I do.



346
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.575
- I think somebody needs a bellhop.
- Excuse me.

347
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.077
Okay.

348
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.499
Let me.

Um...

357
00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:06.979
I gave her this book earlier.

358
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.732
She's a huge Dr. Phil fan.

359
00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.234
Oh, I saw that.
Very nice of you.

360
00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.069
Well, that's me.

361
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.696
People-pleaser, 24-7.


363
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.616
- Well, you are popular.
- I'm sorry.

364
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.244
- No, it's okay. No.
- It isn't usually like this.

365
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.330
Go ahead.

366
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:25.998
Hey. What's up?

367
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.084
Yeah. No, it's okay.

368
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.296
So it's definitely happening?
Uh- huh.

369
00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.381
5:30. Okay, done deal.

370
00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:39.386
Work. For the last time.

371
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.389
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Good flight.

372
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.688
[tone sounds]

373
00:19:51.482 --> 00:19:53.233
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

374
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:59.156
[over PA] <i>At this time
we'd like to ask that you discontinue</i>

375
00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:02.743
<i>the use of any electronic devices,
pagers, cell phones, laptops,</i>

376
00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:05.704
<i>anything with a switch should
now be in the off position.</i>

377
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.624
<i>The use of cell phones is not
allowed during the flight.</i>

378
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.877
<i>A list of devices suitable for
use can be found on the cover</i>

379
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.713
<i>- of your Fresh Air magazine.
- Flight attendants, please be seated.</i>

380
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.106
[over PA] <i>From the deck,
looks like we’re the red- eye to Miami.</i>

381
00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.108
<i>Welcome. The weather
conditions may cause</i>

382
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:37.403
<i>a bumpy takeoff, but don't worry,
we'll soon climb above it.</i>

383
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:40.322
<i>We'll see if we can make up a little
lost time once we're in the air.</i>

384
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.575
<i>We're number one for departure.
Flight attendants, secure the cabin for takeoff.</i>

385
00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:48.831
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared
for takeoff. Please enjoy your flight.

386
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.643
- We're not gonna make it.
- Shut up.

387
00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:11.019
We're not gonna make it.

388
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.480
I will punch you in your face.
Shut up.

389
00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.149
Just kidding. Come on.

390
00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:39.882
Are we there yet?

391
00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:44.928
So, uh, was Henrietta your
mom's mom or your dad's mom?

392
00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:50.392
Um... My mom's. My dad's...

393
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.061
Mmm.

394
00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:56.106
My dad's died a long time ago.

395
00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:58.567
Are your folks still together?

396
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.651
Um...

397
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.322
They divorced three years ago,
uh, married for 32.

398
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:05.741
- Oh.

399
00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:10.454
That's a shame.
So your mom...

400
00:22:10.537 --> 00:22:13.248
Mom moved back to Texas
and Dad stayed in Miami.

401
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.542
I see. And does
Dad still work?

402
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.462
Yeah. No!
He's recently retired.

403
00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:21.632
He's got a lot of time on his
hands so he makes phone calls.

404
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.842
Okay. He's filling
all his work time with...

405
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:25.636
Worry time.

406
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:27.513
Does he have reason
to worry about you?

407
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.184
Well, even if he does,
I mean,

408
00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:36.188
he's just gotta get used
to the fact that life changes

409
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:38.148
and sometimes things happen.

410
00:22:39.274 --> 00:22:40.692
I know what you mean.

411
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:43.570
Usually when things are going perfectly,
you're back on track,

412
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:47.699
everything's going to plan,
and then one day, outta nowhere,

413
00:22:48.408 --> 00:22:50.702
somebody forgets to bolt
the engine to the wing.

414
00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:52.412
Yeah.

415
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:56.833
[over PA] <i>This is your captain. We're
through the worst of it, so you can relax.</i>

416
00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:58.877
<i>Keep your seat belt securely
fastened while seated,</i>

417
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.004
<i>as we may hit more turbulence.
Thank you.</i>

418
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.801
- Thanks for distracting me.
- Well, it's not really what I'm doing.

419
00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:07.678
What are you doing?

420
00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:10.305
Just keeping the focus
on you and your father.

421
00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.724
Why?

422
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.851
Part of my job.

423
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:16.979
Are you a shrink?

424
00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.607
No. Manager.

425
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.027
- Better not say of a hotel.
- No.

426
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.030
- coz that would've...
- given you cause to buy another self- help book.

427
00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:33.537
- So, what do you do?
- Government overthrows,

428
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.498
flashy high- profile
assassinations. The usual.

429
00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:42.754
- You're a spy. I should've known.
- No, I'm not a spy.

430
00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:46.633
- A hit man.
- I'm a lousy shot.

431
00:23:46.717 --> 00:23:48.885
Right.
You work for the CIA.

432
00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.929
Well, if I did,
I couldn't say, could I?

433
00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:53.390
- But, no.
- The Mafia?

434
00:23:53.473 --> 00:23:55.142
The money's shit.

435
00:23:58.312 --> 00:23:59.938
Okay, well,
that's kinda weird.

436
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:02.733
- Why don't you tell me what you do?
- I did.

437
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:09.072
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, I...

438
00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:12.951
It's... Whatever you do,
that's your own business.

439
00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:14.828
Just as long as you're not...

440
00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.288
What?

441
00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:19.166
Hijacking the plane.

442
00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.752
Oh. No.
No, I'm not suicidal.

443
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:23.337
That's good.

444
00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:27.215
And you're right. You know, most days
it is my own business.

445
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:31.595
But right now, as fate would have it,
my business is all about you.

446
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:35.974
- I'm sorry, about me?
- That's right.

447
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.603
Okay, I'm not sure
where you're going with this.

448
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:43.023
Charles Keefe. One of your regular VIPs.
Ring a bell?

449
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:48.362
- No, should it?
- Yes, it should.

450
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:51.365
Right now he's on his way to your hotel
and that's why you need to listen.

451
00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.991
No. No, I don't think...

452
00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:54.951
- I don't have to do that.
- Yes, you do,

453
00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:56.495
if you want
your dad to live.

454
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.208
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

455
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:06.880
Yeah.

456
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:09.549
- [tone sounds]
- Suit yourself.

457
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:12.260
You might wanna
take a look at this.

458
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:16.515
JR. Joe Reisert.
Your father? Yes?

459
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.143
- Where did you get that?
- Oh. I didn't get it.

460
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:22.729
My associate grabbed it
off your dad's desk.

461
00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:25.190
Apparently next to
your graduation picture.

462
00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:28.235
JR.
Definitely Dad's wallet.

463
00:25:28.318 --> 00:25:29.945
His initials.
But gee, mine too.

464
00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:32.906
Jack Rippner.
Credit card, license.

465
00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:36.034
"For some reason, Stewardess,
this emotionally unstable,

466
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:38.745
inebriated girl, whom
I've never met before tonight,

467
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:41.707
suddenly went crazy when
I took it out of my pocket."

468
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.336
You tell the flight attendant
and your dad dies.

469
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.924
[mouths words]

470
00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:52.676
Sit down.

471
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.354
You might wanna buckle up.

472
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:16.908
- Any luck?
- First our pensions go, then our coffeepots.

473
00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:19.828
18- G's flashing.
Do you want me to...?

474
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:23.165
I'll take care of it.
She probably just wants another drink.

475
00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.332
Maybe I'll join her.

476
00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.843
- Hi.
- Hi.

477
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.095
- What can I do for ya?
- Leese,

478
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.723
did you need another
pillow or anything?

479
00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:42.809
No, I don't need anything.

480
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.979
She's just had
a really rough day.

481
00:26:46.062 --> 00:26:47.355
A death in the family.

482
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:50.859
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

483
00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:53.987
- I'll get you water and some tissues.
- [Jack] Thanks.

484
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.281
- Be right back.
- Thank you.

485
00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:01.369
That was great, Leese.
Keep doing the right thing.

486
00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.414
Just bottle the emotions
a little more, okay?

487
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.376
Have you done
something to my father?

488
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.589
No. And it'll stay that way
as long as you keep playing along.

489
00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:17.427
What do you want from me?

490
00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:19.805
Now, I wanna wait
for your Kleenex and water.

491
00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:22.516
And once we have our privacy,
we can get back to business.

492
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.477
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you so much.

493
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.146
- Sure. Feel better, hon.
- Thank you.

494
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:43.703
I need you
to call your hotel.

495
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.623
It's very simple.
Just use your managerial pull

496
00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:50.961
to move Keefe
from 3825 to suite 4080.

497
00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:53.880
I'll leave the details to you.
You just sell it.

498
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:58.760
You've got the wrong person.
I don't have the authority to do that.

499
00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.554
Well, I happen
to know that you do.

500
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:02.848
You're the only voice
that can get this done

501
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:04.975
by the time
I need it done.

502
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.354
You need me to write it down?

503
00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:10.564
No.

504
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.942
Well, then what's the delay?

505
00:28:18.154 --> 00:28:21.199
So by changing Keefe's room,
does that make it easier?

506
00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:28.582
Lisa, whatever female- driven,
emotion- based dilemma

507
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.835
you're dealing with right now,
you have my sympathy.

508
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.546
But for the sake
of time and sanity,

509
00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:38.717
let's break this down into
a little male- driven, fact- based logic.

510
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.470
One simple phone call
saves your dad's life.

511
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.180
And it has to be made soon.

512
00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:49.728
You're gonna kill Keefe,
aren't you?

513
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:53.273
You really need to start worrying
more about your dad, Leese.

514
00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:56.318
How am I supposed to know if he's okay?
How do I know you haven't hurt him?

515
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:57.444
He's fine.

516
00:28:57.527 --> 00:28:59.029
Why am I supposed to believe?

517
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:03.158
The last call I got said he was sitting
in the TV room eating leftover lasagna

518
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.160
and watching the comedy marathon.

519
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:10.040
Relax, Leese. By now my guy is probably
back in his silver Beemer,

520
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:14.085
parked outside
9321 Blossom Palms Lane.

521
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.796
He's sitting in the dark,

That's a knife, Leese.

524
00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.436
I wanna talk to my dad.

525
00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.104
Sure. After you make the call.

526
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:37.150
No. I wanna know he's okay
right now or I don't call anybody.

Leese? Are you already home?

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.602
but are you all right?

545

You sound upset.

Leese? Are you still there?



549
00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:08.575
Did he sound
healthy to you?

550
00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:12.412
I hope that's a yes,
because that's the best I can do.

551
00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:14.122
Now let's get
this over with.

552
00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:19.044
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Can you help me again?

553
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:21.588
Last time, I promise.

554
00:31:22.505 --> 00:31:23.882
Sure.

555

Don't get cute.

-  You're so sweet.
- Hello, again.

00:31:47.197 --> 00:31:50.366
You know, I didn't think that
this book would be so much work.

558
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.704
There's all these surveys about yourself
before you can go on to the rest...

559
00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.873
Could you
wait one second?

560
00:31:57.665 --> 00:31:59.459
- Sure.
- My nails.

561
00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:02.253
Know what? Don't worry
about the surveys. I'll just...

562
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:05.423

Would you gimme your address
too? I wanna return the favor.

 I'm always breaking
my nails on these things.

I'm gonna need you
to help me put it back up.

Clear the aisle.

We're on a collision course.

570
00:32:23.983 --> 00:32:25.068
I'll come back for that later.

571
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:26.486
No. Here you go.

572
00:32:26.569 --> 00:32:28.113

- Thank you.

573

Okay.

I didn't want this
to get complicated.

I have to assume
she's gonna read that.

I'm challenging you,

to stop dealing

It's right here.

Fact:

You've been out
for a half an hour

602
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.602
and Keefe's room still
hasn't been changed.

00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:02.037
Everyone shares. I'll take you
to the one close to your seat.

701
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:04.123
But a lady's in there too.

702
00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:08.043
Okay, one of those flights.
Here, come on.

703
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.795
[gasping]

704
00:43:09.879 --> 00:43:11.922
Please, just stop
whoever's at my dad's house.

705
00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:16.719
I already have, by twice intercepting
these little communiqués.

706
00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:19.555
If they'd have fallen into
the hands of a stewardess,

707
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:22.850
she'd have gone to the cockpit
and we'd land somewhere else.

708
00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:26.061
If that happens, Leese,
our guy in the BMW's

709
00:43:26.145 --> 00:43:29.732
gonna know about it.
So do Dad a favor

710
00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:32.693
and stop gambling
with his life.

711
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:43.370
You don't have to do this.
Any of this.

712
00:43:54.256 --> 00:43:55.591
Someone do that to you?

713
00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.677
No.

714
00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.597
Is that what it is?

715
00:44:04.266 --> 00:44:05.518
No.

716
00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.520
You know what I think?

717
00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:10.397
You know what I think?

718
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:13.067
I think you're not
such an honest person.

719
00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:16.070
Because I've followed
you for eight weeks now

720
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.614
and I never once
saw you order anything

721
00:44:18.697 --> 00:44:20.741
but a fucking sea breeze.

722
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:23.994
[gasping] I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

723
00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:27.998
[moaning, coughing]

724
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:31.627
I never lied to you, Leese.

725
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.713
Know why?
'Cause it doesn't serve me.

726
00:44:34.797 --> 00:44:37.466
We're both professional.
We have the will and the means

727
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.052
to follow through.
'Cause when we don't,

728
00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:42.513
our customers aren't happy.
And when they're not,

729
00:44:42.596 --> 00:44:44.807
we suffer
and our lives go to shit.

730
00:44:46.267 --> 00:44:48.978
And that's not
going to happen.

731
00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:50.104
Is it?

732
00:44:52.439 --> 00:44:54.859
- Good.

733
00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:58.279
Because I'm gonna tell you
the phones are working again.

734
00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:00.823
Are you sure we
got a deal this time?

735
00:45:02.324 --> 00:45:04.493
- Huh?
- Yes.

736
00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:07.580
Peachy.

737
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.002
Well, thanks
for the quickie.

738
00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:16.005
Good.

739
00:45:18.007 --> 00:45:19.216
Come on.

740
00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:23.762
Excuse me.

741
00:45:27.641 --> 00:45:29.435
This isn't a motel.

742
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:31.687
Sure.

743
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.985
- Lose something?
- Yes, my book.

744
00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:41.947
 It was here. Maybe it
slipped down behind your...

745
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:46.535
I need you to pull
yourself together, Lisa.

746
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.330
We seem to have attracted
a little attention.

747
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.999
Once they've made their
rounds, we'll make the call.

748
00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:56.170
[over PA] <i>The captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

749
00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:59.214
<i>Please return to your seats
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

750
00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:16.523
Yo. You steal
my pen, jackass?

751
00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:19.485
No, man, cut it out.
I'm sleepin'.

752
00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:28.494
Mr. Keefe has a 7am breakfast
and the meeting's at 8am sharp.

753
00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:31.330
We're out by 9:15.
How we doin'?

754
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:33.040
Cars are en route
and on time.

755
00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:35.584
Armored Escalades,
full communication package.

756
00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:38.921
- Thanks. We're all set.
- Good. Get these out with changes.

757
00:46:39.004 --> 00:46:40.297
- You got it.
- Think fast!

758
00:46:40.381 --> 00:46:42.716
-  Danny. Daddy's working.
- Thattaboy.

759
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.093
Come here, you.

760
00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:47.054
 You should be sleeping.

761
00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:50.015
[over PA] <i>Ten minutes
till wheels down.</i>

762
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:12.997
Trash?

763
00:47:21.964 --> 00:47:23.465
I'll get that.


766
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.144
It's time.



768
00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:43.986
Thank you.


770
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.418
Lux Atlantic Resort,
this is Cynthia.

771
00:48:00.502 --> 00:48:01.712
<i>Hello?</i>

772
00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:04.590
- Cynthia, it's Lisa.
<i>- Hey, you.</i>

773
00:48:05.174 --> 00:48:06.800
So I guess you
still need that favor.

774
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:10.763
Yeah. I was checking
with Dan Young from Maintenance.

775
00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:14.516
- We can't put Keefe in that room.
- But he always stays there.

776
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.854
I know. But they were fixing
a water valve in the master bath

777
00:48:18.937 --> 00:48:23.317
and they didn't fix the right one
so if anyone uses the plumbing...

778
00:48:23.942 --> 00:48:26.361
- The shit'll hit the fan.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

779
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.280
So where do we move him to?

780
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.744
<i>Lisa? You still there?</i>

781
00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:35.245
4080.

782
00:48:36.872 --> 00:48:39.917
4080. Okay.

783
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.086
- His security people will be...?
- You're right.

784
00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:44.088
They're not gonna be happy,
so just...

785
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.675
- Just tell them I authorized it.
- Okay. Oh, my God.</i>

786
00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:52.596
The cigars, the Cristal.
There's hardly time, Leese. I better go.

787
00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:04.608
Outstanding.

788
00:49:06.985 --> 00:49:08.320
We're close.

789
00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:18.747
What?

790
00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:22.960
You know what. My dad.

791
00:49:23.043 --> 00:49:25.504
Make the call.
Your part of the deal.

792
00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.428
- I still need you.
- You promised.

793
00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.140
I'll keep that. As soon
as we're on the ground,

794
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:38.225
I'll get confirmation
Keefe has been handled.

795
00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:41.812
While you wait, what if your
guy decides to kill my dad

796
00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:44.857
- because you didn't make the call?
- He doesn't make a move

797
00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.944
unless I say so. He's a good dog.
He responds only to his master's voice.

798
00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:54.074
It'll all be over soon.
The Keefes will be history,

799
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:56.535
your dad will be safe,
we'll both go back...

800
00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:59.163
- What did you say?
- What?

801
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:01.248
His family's with him?

802
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:04.459
You're gonna kill
his family too?

803
00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:08.630
Somebody wants to send
a big brash message,

804
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:10.299
that's their business.

805
00:50:11.216 --> 00:50:12.885
I do my part, move on.

806
00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:21.643
Oh, my God.

807
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.730
Lisa, shh.

808
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.710
Hi, welcome to the Lux Atlantic.
Welcome to the Lux Atlantic.

809
00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.128
Hi. Here are all your keys.

810
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:51.590
We're putting you in suite 4080.
Manager got that approved.

811
00:50:51.673 --> 00:50:53.508
4080? We're in 3825.

812
00:50:54.092 --> 00:50:57.137
- 4080. Beautiful suite.
- We're always in 3825.

813
00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:59.723
Except, we've got a bad
plumbing problem in 3825.

814
00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.851
4080, toilets are good.

815
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.645
They want us
to switch rooms.

816
00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:07.397
We made redundant reservations.
We can go to the Hilton.

817
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.901
Charles.
The kids are exhausted.

818
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:13.570
- Who made the approval?
- Lisa Reisert.

819
00:51:13.654 --> 00:51:15.572
It's okay, I know her.

820
00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:18.033
- We need to sweep the room.
- Well, get on it.

821
00:51:18.116 --> 00:51:19.493
Yes, sir.

822
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.384
[over PA] <i>Well, we've begun
our initial descent into Miami.</i>

823

you have many choices when you fly.</i>

00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:44.768
 How long till we land?

827
00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:47.271
We should be touching down
in just a few minutes.

828
00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:52.985
Ma'am. Please
put your seat up. Thank you.

- [moans]
<i>- Thank you.</i>

832
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:05.622
What's wrong now?

833
00:52:05.706 --> 00:52:07.040
You hit me on the head

834
00:52:07.124 --> 00:52:09.334
and slammed me against
the wall, remember?

835
00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:11.336
Well, suck it up.

836
00:52:12.004 --> 00:52:13.880
We've come too far.
Don't blow it now.

837
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:17.592
Come on, sit up.
Sit up, Leese.

838
00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:21.263
We're almost there.

839
00:52:44.953 --> 00:52:46.872
- Anything?
- Not much. A yacht.

840
00:52:46.955 --> 00:52:49.249
Way out there.
Fishing, I think.

841
00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:51.793

I'll call off
Mr. Killer from outside Dad's

852

and then you're free.
Free to yell and scream,

853
00:53:38.006 --> 00:53:42.260
call your dad, tell him to run
to the neighbor's. Sound good?

they done me so far?

1052
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.363
- We'll talk again.
- Don't move.

1053
01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.211
<font color="Chocolate">JOE</font>: Hey!


1055
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.810
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

1056
01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.923
Right over there. Right there.

1057
01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.007
Excuse me.


1059
01:15:14.134 --> 01:15:15.386
Cynthia.

1060
01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:17.554
- We got it covered.
- Are you okay?

1061
01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.014
- Yeah, I'm...
- Yeah?

1062
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.432
Yeah, I mean...

1063
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.726
I think we had a really good night,
all things considered.

1064
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.396
Just that one
incident, really.

1065
01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.107
Cynthia, you did so good.

1066
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.234
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1067
01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:33.946
Excuse me. Ladies.

1068
01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.322
Mr. Keefe.

1069
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.741
I'd like to thank you both.

1070
01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.869
- For my family, I thank you.
-  Sir. We have to go.

1071
01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.913
- Let's talk soon, yes?
- Mm- hmm.

1072
01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:46.583
-  Roger that.
- <font color="Chocolate">MARIANNE</font>: Lisa!

1073
01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.169
This is the worst
experience we have ever had.

1074
01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:51.630
Do you have any idea
what we have been through?

1075
01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.383
- Well...
- First there was no reservation.

1076
01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:59.263
Then, our ceiling exploded.
I got chunks of plaster all over me.

1077
01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:00.973
I could get asthma.

1078
01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.393
I'm so sorry. Is there anything
we can do to make it up to you?

1079
01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.979
Yes.
Start by cleaning house.

1080
01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:10.607
Get rid of her.
She is completely incompetent.

1081
01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:13.235
Absolutely. And cheeky too.

1082
01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.572
I see. Well...

1083
01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:22.453
Here's what you can do- You can fill out
a comment card at our front desk.

1084
01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:26.165
A comment card? She asked us
to fill out a comment card.

1085
01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.375
You want us to fill
out a comment card?

1086
01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:30.961
Yes, I do. And after you
finish, you can go ahead

1087
01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:32.963
and just shove it up your ass.

1088
01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.093
Yeah.

1089
01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.472
- You are so my hero.
- Let's get outta here.

1090
01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:43.390
- Let's open the bar.
- Champagne?

1091
01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.892
Oh, anything but a bay breeze.

1092
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.226
Okay.
