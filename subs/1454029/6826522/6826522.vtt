00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.422
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

2
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.468
And did you know, as a girl growing up,
that one day you'd be a maid?

3
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.846
Yes, ma'am, I did.

4
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.598
And you knew that because...

5
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.311
My mama was a maid.
My grandmama was a house slave.

6
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:47.441
House... slave.

7
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.570
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

8
00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.702
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

9
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.663
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

10
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.959
It feel...

11
00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.766
I done raised 17 kids in my life.

12
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:24.311
Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.

13
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.397
Aibee, Aibee.

14
00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:29.566
- Hi!
- Aibee!

15
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.779
I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bowl

16
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.240
before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.

17
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.618
Babies like fat.

18
00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.704
They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.

19
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.334
You is kind, you is smart...

20
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.670
...you is important.

21
00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:52.339
- You is smart...
- Smart...

22
00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.925
- ...you is kind...
- ...you is kind...

23
00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.928
- ...you is important.
- ...you is important.

24
00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.347
That's so good.

25
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.434
That's so good.

26
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.357
I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four, six days a week.

27
00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:16.280
I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.

28
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.744
I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.

29
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.585
But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.

30
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.963
And, Lord, I worry
she gonna be fat.

31
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.716
Mae Mobley.

32
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.926
Ain't going to be
no beauty queen either.

33
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.763
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

34
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.767
- Yes.
- And Hilly's devilled eggs. No paprika.

35
00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:49.730
Does this dress look homemade?

36
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.026
I reckon when you finish it won't.

37
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.695
Well, thank you.

38
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.824
Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.

39
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.453
The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.

40
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.830
I done seen it happen plenty of times,

41
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.416
once babies start having
their own babies.

42
00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.346
And the young white ladies of Jackson...

43
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.973
...oh Lord, was they having babies.

44
00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.934
But not Miss Skeeter.

45
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.937
No man and no babies.

46
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.972
- Morning.
- Hi.

47
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.391
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

48
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.986
Eugenia Phelan, Mr Blackly.

49
00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:22.990
Shut the damn door.

50
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:26.702
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

51
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:29.162
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

52
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.544
Murrah High: editor.

53
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.589
Ole Miss Rebel Rouser: editor.

54
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:39.840
Double major.

55
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.967
Junior League: editor.

56
00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:45.971
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

57
00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.515
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

58
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.060
Right here.

59
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.024
This...

60
00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.942
This is a rejection letter.

61
00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.695
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

62
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.572
Stein?

63
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.158
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

64
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.534
Oh, Lord.

65
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.453
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr Blackly.

66
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.040
I applied for a job,
but Mrs Stein thought...

67
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.791
She said no.

68
00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:16.877
Well, until I gain some experience.

69
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.462
See? Says right there.

70
00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:22.049
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again."

71
00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:27.471
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

72
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.890
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

73
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.558
Grab that basket.

74
00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:36.522
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

75
00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:39.024
She drunk hair spray or something.

76
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.568
I want you to read her past columns.

77
00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.238
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

78
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.907
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

79
00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:49.034
You know who Miss Myrna is?

80
00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.578
I read her articles all the time.

81
00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.915
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

82
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:58.460
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

83
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:00.921
Hello?

84
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.759
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

85
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.221
What? Shut that goddamn door.

86
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:26.947
Mama, we're late for bridge!

87
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:29.741
Miss Hilly was the first of the babies
to have a baby.

88
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.493
...three...

89
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.204
And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,

90
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:36.748
'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,

91
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:39.793
every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.

92
00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:42.254
Minny, go get Mama!

93
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.304
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

94
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.972
I'm down.

95
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.808
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

96
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.853
Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

97
00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.981
Take that off.
It's 98 degrees out there.

98
00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.649
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.526
Well, let's put my coat on then.

100
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.695
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

101
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.197
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.032
OK, let me get the pie.

103
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.743
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

104
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.957
Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house

105
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.793
and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny, too.

106
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.881
See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,

107
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.674
and Miss Hilly wanted her.

108
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:33.263
I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.

109
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.975
After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.

110
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.895
It took God and Minny
to get me through it.

111
00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:46.318
Minny my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.

112
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:55.619
After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.

113
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.581
And I just didn't feel
so accepting anymore.

114
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.137
No.

115
00:09:14.263 --> 00:09:17.724
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

116
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:18.892
No.

117
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.186
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

118
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.860
Mae Mobley, you're going!

119
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:31.154
Aibileen, the girls are pulling up,
and the table isn't set.

120
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.907
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

121
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.159
Get in your room right now.

122
00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:39.955
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

123
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.295
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

124
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.422
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

125
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.090
Hey, girls.

126
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:56.722
Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

127
00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:04.062
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

128
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.399
She looks like the winning horse
at the Kentucky Derby.

129
00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:09.151
All flowers and bows.

130
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.278
Got to have paprika on them.

131
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.116
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

132
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:19.703
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

133
00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:21.455
Did she?

134
00:10:22.164 --> 00:10:25.918
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

135
00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.923
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

136
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.217
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

137
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.220
And you know she will!

138
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:45.103
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

139
00:10:45.229 --> 00:10:46.855
All right, I'll be back.

140
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.982
Minny, cord, girl.

141
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.026
Shut up.

142
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.321
The Guiding Light.

143
00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:59.243
Hi, Missus Walters.

144
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.828
I'm watching my story.

145
00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:03.789
OK.

146
00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:05.791
Isn't it gorgeous?

147
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.334
Sorry I'm late.

148
00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:11.088
You're home!

149
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.298
I missed you all, too.

150
00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:19.012
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

151
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.306
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

152
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.892
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

153
00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:28.856
I've got a great summer planned for you.

154
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:30.148
Great.

155
00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:33.360
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

156
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.322
What?

157
00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.868
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

158
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.830
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

159
00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.248
Again?

160
00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.168
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

161
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:51.545
It's offshore.

162
00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:55.507
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

163
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.050
so just forget it.

164
00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.261
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

165
00:12:00.304 --> 00:12:01.388
Sorry!

166
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:09.813
I got a job today.

167
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.400
At The Jackson Journal.

168
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.988
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

169
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.283
To Skeeter and her job.

170
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.243
Last stop till marriage.

171
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.918
It's for the Miss Myrna column.

172
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.128
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

173
00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:37.090
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

174
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.010
My Aibileen?

175
00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.263
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

176
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.270
Constantine quit us.

177
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.565
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

178
00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:58.111
Anyway, I just... I don't really know
how to answer these letters.

179
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.449
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

180
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:04.451
I don't see why not.

181
00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:13.836
Leefolt residence.

182
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.963
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

183
00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:18.465
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

184
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.469
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

185
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:25.389
I'll call back tomorrow.

186
00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:26.598
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.643
Miss?

188
00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:34.231
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

189
00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:35.482
No, ma'am.

190
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.235
OK. It's Celia Foote.

191
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.114
Emerson-684. Bye now.

192
00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.581
You scared the daylights out of me!

193
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:55.043
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

194
00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.507
Honestly!

195
00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:09.057
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

196
00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.021
Who was that on the phone?

197
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.190
Miss Celia Foote called again.

198
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.359
I've never called her back, Hilly.

199
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.197
She can't take a hint, can she?

200
00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.032
Who's Celia Foote?

201
00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:27.159
That tacky girl Johnny married.

202
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.161
From Sugar Ditch.

203
00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:30.913
It could have been you, Hilly.

204
00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:35.209
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

205
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.548
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlour, and she had the nerve to ask

206
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.550
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

207
00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:47.054
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

208
00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:50.307
Yes, but we're not telling her.

209
00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.561
Thank you, Aibileen.

210
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:01.735
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

211
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:03.445
I'm fine.

212
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.405
Oh, she's just upset

213
00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:08.325
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

214
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.039
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

215
00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.249
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.126
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

217
00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:22.005
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

218
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.423
She does not.

219
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:27.511
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

220
00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.723
Have you all seen the cover
of Life this week?

221
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.350
Jackie's never looked more regal.

222
00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:36.311
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colour's bathroom

223
00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.314
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

224
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:44.778
It's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

225
00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:46.738
Pass.

226
00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:50.158
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

227
00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.535
The what?

228
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.620
A disease-preventative bill

229
00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:58.292
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the coloured help.

230
00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:01.461
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

231
00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:08.468
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

232
00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:12.181
You ought not to joke
about the coloured situation.

233
00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.185
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

234
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.105
Your lead, Elizabeth.

235
00:16:31.617 --> 00:16:33.202
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:38.290
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those Miss Myrna letters?

237
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.045
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

238
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:47.174
Thank you, Aibileen.

239
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.178
All that talk in there today...

240
00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:53.680
Hilly's talk?

241
00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:56.517
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

242
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.653
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

243
00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:09.863
Yes, ma'am, it is.

244
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:13.116
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

245
00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:17.663
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

246
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.623
Have you seen her lately?

247
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.291
No, ma'am.

248
00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:23.877
Did you know that she had quit us?

249
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:25.212
Quit?

250
00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.549
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

251
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:32.553
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

252
00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:35.681
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

253
00:17:35.806 --> 00:17:37.891
There you are, Skeeter.

254
00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.479
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

255
00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:43.605
OK.

256
00:17:45.274 --> 00:17:46.733
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

257
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.570
to get started on those
Miss Myrna letters.

258
00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:50.821
Y'all make it quick.

259
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.407
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

260
00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.760
Hi, Jameso.

261
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.304
How you, Miss Eugenia?

262
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:18.390
Mama?

263
00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.729
Mama.

264
00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.202
Mama?

265
00:18:38.327 --> 00:18:39.494
Back here, honey!

266
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:46.460
Is this a little too young?

267
00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.171
That's a little too everything.

268
00:18:50.506 --> 00:18:52.257
Oh, hell. You're right.

269
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.857
OK.

270
00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:12.945
Much better.

271
00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:16.448
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

272
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:18.909
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

273
00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:21.828
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

274
00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:23.247
What really happened?

275
00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:26.333
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

276
00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.459
Unzip me.

277
00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:30.212
Come on.

278
00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:34.925
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

279
00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.845
After she got that teller job,

280
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.013
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

281
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.224
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

282
00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.561
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

283
00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:50.440
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

284
00:19:50.566 --> 00:19:52.818
Oh, now look at this.

285
00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:56.738
This dress is just precious on you.

286
00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:00.868
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

287
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.998
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

288
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:07.332
Where?

289
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.918
Writing for The Jackson Journal.

290
00:20:12.296 --> 00:20:13.630
Great.

291
00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:16.550
You can write my obituary!

292
00:20:16.717 --> 00:20:20.804
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single."

293
00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:23.557
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

294
00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.476
Skeeter! Skeeter!

295
00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.854
Skeeter!

296
00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:34.902
I need to ask you something.

297
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:43.744
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

298
00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:45.746
They start thinking these...

299
00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:49.458
...unnatural thoughts.

300
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:50.876
Are you...

301
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:57.549
Do you... find men attractive?

302
00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:02.846
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

303
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.724
Oh, my God.

304
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:10.604
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

305
00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:16.026
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

306
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.654
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

307
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:25.619
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

308
00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.959
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

309
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.878
It's a start, Carlton.

310
00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:38.590
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

311
00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.802
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

312
00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:44.805
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

313
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:47.391
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

314
00:21:47.516 --> 00:21:50.853
No, Pascagoula. You couldn't have known
this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

315
00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:53.146
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

316
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.525
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

317
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.110
Oh, my Lord.

318
00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:02.030
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

319
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.657
You have pushed it, young lady.

320
00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:07.494
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

321
00:22:08.662 --> 00:22:09.872
Well...

322
00:22:10.664 --> 00:22:13.959
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

323
00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.670
People move on, Skeeter.

324
00:22:16.837 --> 00:22:19.131
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

325
00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.888
I don't believe you.

326
00:22:27.723 --> 00:22:30.058
She would've written and told me.

327
00:22:39.526 --> 00:22:41.028
Did you fire her?

328
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:45.866
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

329
00:22:46.033 --> 00:22:49.620
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

330
00:22:50.454 --> 00:22:53.123
- She raised me.
- She did not!

331
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:55.918
She worked here for 29 years!

332
00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.961
It was a coloured thing
and I put it behind me!

333
00:22:59.046 --> 00:23:02.883
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

334
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.015
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

335
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:57.062
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

336
00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.480
It's all right.

337
00:23:59.648 --> 00:24:03.068
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

338
00:24:04.111 --> 00:24:05.988
All the boys say I'm ugly.

339
00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:11.952
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

340
00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:15.831
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

341
00:24:15.956 --> 00:24:18.083
Now, that's ugly.

342
00:24:19.126 --> 00:24:22.754
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

343
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.258
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

344
00:24:27.718 --> 00:24:29.553
Now you're not one of them, is you?

345
00:24:30.596 --> 00:24:32.514
I didn't think so, honey.

346
00:24:37.686 --> 00:24:38.687
Every day...

347
00:24:40.689 --> 00:24:43.525
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

348
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.155
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

349
00:24:49.698 --> 00:24:52.034
Got to ask yourself this question:

350
00:24:52.826 --> 00:24:54.286
"Am I gonna believe

351
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.166
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

352
00:25:01.126 --> 00:25:02.169
You hear me?

353
00:25:02.336 --> 00:25:05.631
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

354
00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:08.175
them fools say about me today?"

355
00:25:11.053 --> 00:25:12.179
All right?

356
00:25:15.307 --> 00:25:19.186
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

357
00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:22.022
It picked her.

358
00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:25.943
But you...

359
00:25:28.737 --> 00:25:32.282
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

360
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.035
You wait and see.

361
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:40.332
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

362
00:26:01.812 --> 00:26:04.773
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

363
00:26:04.898 --> 00:26:06.149
particularly if it bothers no one else.

364
00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:07.276
Come on.

365
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.236
And I understand that now.

366
00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:11.905
Continue.

367
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.742
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

368
00:26:17.202 --> 00:26:19.830
These coloured women
raise white children,

369
00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:23.208
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

370
00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:26.086
We love them and they love us,

371
00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:28.672
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

372
00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.257
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

373
00:26:30.424 --> 00:26:31.425
I'm listening.

374
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:35.721
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

375
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:38.765
who dedicates her whole life
to a white family.

376
00:26:38.891 --> 00:26:42.186
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

377
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:45.105
So, a side to this never before heard?

378
00:26:45.272 --> 00:26:47.191
Yes.

379
00:26:47.316 --> 00:26:50.194
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

380
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:54.907
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

381
00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:57.201
Go away!

382
00:27:00.913 --> 00:27:03.874
- Who was that?
- My mother.

383
00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:05.459
Look.

384
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:09.129
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

385
00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:12.925
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

386
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.343
I already have a maid.

387
00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:19.973
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

388
00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:22.267
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:29.149
I guess I can read
what you come up with.

390
00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:31.401
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

391
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.028
Thank you, Miss Stein.

392
00:27:33.153 --> 00:27:34.988
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

393
00:27:35.113 --> 00:27:38.075
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

394
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.745
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

395
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.997
Go get yourself an apartment.

396
00:27:48.293 --> 00:27:50.003
"Dear Miss Myrna:

397
00:27:51.004 --> 00:27:53.715
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

398
00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:57.344
Shoot, that's easy. You tell her
hold a matchstick between her teeth.

399
00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:00.347
Is it lit?

400
00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.182
No, ma'am.

401
00:28:04.434 --> 00:28:07.479
Miss Leefolt said you could start
right away.

402
00:28:07.813 --> 00:28:12.150
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

403
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:16.405
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

404
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:24.288
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

405
00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:26.206
Bye, Skeeter!

406
00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:31.378
Aibileen.

407
00:28:31.503 --> 00:28:35.215
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

408
00:28:38.427 --> 00:28:42.389
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

409
00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:45.475
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

410
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:50.397
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

411
00:28:50.564 --> 00:28:53.942
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

412
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:57.196
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

413
00:28:57.321 --> 00:29:00.240
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

414
00:29:00.365 --> 00:29:01.825
Other maids?

415
00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:05.787
I was hoping to get four or five.

416
00:29:07.414 --> 00:29:10.250
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

417
00:29:13.337 --> 00:29:18.258
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

418
00:29:18.383 --> 00:29:20.552
The good and the bad.

419
00:29:20.886 --> 00:29:23.180
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

420
00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:25.933
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

421
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:27.267
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

422
00:29:27.392 --> 00:29:30.145
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

423
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.148
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

424
00:29:33.273 --> 00:29:34.483
Hilly's covering the cost and said

425
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:36.485
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

426
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:38.862
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

427
00:29:41.615 --> 00:29:43.492
Skeeter, how you doing?

428
00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:46.078
Fine.

429
00:29:50.457 --> 00:29:52.000
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

430
00:29:55.295 --> 00:29:57.464
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

431
00:30:01.844 --> 00:30:03.345
Skeeter.

432
00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:06.974
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

433
00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:08.934
Oh, sure, sure.

434
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:12.855
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

435
00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:15.607
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:29.913
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

437
00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:41.466
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

438
00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:46.513
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr Walters!

439
00:30:46.638 --> 00:30:48.390
He loves riding these waves!

440
00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:50.976
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

441
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:52.477
Yes, ma'am.

442
00:30:53.395 --> 00:30:56.356
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

443
00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:00.485
No, ma'am. We ain't.

444
00:31:03.989 --> 00:31:07.951
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

445
00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:13.916
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

446
00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:15.334
How about that?

447
00:31:30.182 --> 00:31:31.266
Miss Hilly?

448
00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:36.647
Never mind.

449
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.691
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

450
00:31:40.025 --> 00:31:42.945
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

451
00:31:43.695 --> 00:31:47.074
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

452
00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:51.078
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

453
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.667
Daddy ruined you.

454
00:32:00.254 --> 00:32:02.130
I'm just gonna get your tea.

455
00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:32.286
Minny?

456
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.330
Minny, are you in there?

457
00:32:37.374 --> 00:32:38.625
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:41.712
And just what are you doing?

459
00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:51.388
Get off my toilet!

460
00:32:56.518 --> 00:32:59.188
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

461
00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:12.659
Go on!

462
00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:24.796
Eighteen people died in Jackson
that day.

463
00:33:26.215 --> 00:33:28.175
Ten white and eight black.

464
00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:36.558
God don't pay no mind to colour once
He decides to set a tornado loose.

465
00:33:36.683 --> 00:33:39.645
Aibee's here, honey.

466
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.396
Aibee's here.

467
00:34:03.252 --> 00:34:06.380
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley is up,
and I'm off to the doctor!

468
00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:15.514
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

469
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.391
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

470
00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:19.560
Yes, ma'am.

471
00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:21.603
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

472
00:34:23.647 --> 00:34:26.149
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

473
00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:27.400
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:34:42.748 --> 00:34:46.420
You're my real mama, Aibee.

475
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.281
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

476
00:35:14.907 --> 00:35:16.783
Hey, Aibileen!

477
00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:18.619
Hey, Minny!

478
00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:21.788
Where you headed?

479
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.335
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

480
00:35:27.461 --> 00:35:28.837
All right, then. Well, bye!

481
00:35:29.171 --> 00:35:30.797
Bye!

482
00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.675
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

483
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.553
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

484
00:35:38.597 --> 00:35:39.932
Aibileen.

485
00:35:43.602 --> 00:35:45.604
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

486
00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:47.814
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

487
00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:51.193
You got some more
Miss Myrna questions for me?

488
00:35:51.318 --> 00:35:53.403
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

489
00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:59.326
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

490
00:35:59.451 --> 00:36:01.620
About that book I want to write?

491
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.388
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

492
00:36:20.389 --> 00:36:21.640
I know it's scary.

493
00:36:25.894 --> 00:36:28.605
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

494
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.774
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

495
00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:33.318
A book like this has never
been written before.

496
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:34.987
'Cause there's a reason.

497
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.990
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

498
00:36:38.323 --> 00:36:39.533
I promise we'll be careful.

499
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.244
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

500
00:36:47.457 --> 00:36:50.043
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

501
00:36:50.377 --> 00:36:52.421
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

502
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.466
All right.

503
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:58.802
Here's my phone number.

504
00:37:02.514 --> 00:37:05.726
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

505
00:37:17.404 --> 00:37:21.033
"No person shall require
any white female

506
00:37:21.366 --> 00:37:25.704
to nurse in wards or rooms
in which Negro men are placed.

507
00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:32.961
Books shall not be interchangeable
between the white and coloured schools,

508
00:37:34.338 --> 00:37:38.342
but shall continue to be used
by the race first using them.

509
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:45.933
No coloured barber shall serve as
a barber to white women or girls.

510
00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:52.105
Any person printing, publishing
or circulating written matter

urging for public acceptance or social
equality between whites and Negroes

512
00:37:57.778 --> 00:37:59.863
is subject to imprisonment."

513
00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:02.366
Hello?

514
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.536
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

515
00:38:06.578 --> 00:38:08.622
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

516
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:10.332
Why, Minny?

517
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:13.710
She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief.

518
00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:16.421
Said I stole a candelabra.

519
00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:20.050
But I got her back.

520
00:38:20.384 --> 00:38:21.927
What you did?

521
00:38:23.387 --> 00:38:24.638
I can't tell you.

522
00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:27.975
I ain't telling nobody.

523
00:38:32.479 --> 00:38:36.149
I done something terrible awful
to that woman,

524
00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:38.944
and now she know what I done.

525
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:40.487
Sorry.

526
00:38:44.741 --> 00:38:45.742
Minny.

527
00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:47.870
She got what she deserved, Aibileen.

528
00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:51.832
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

529
00:38:53.834 --> 00:38:56.044
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

530
00:39:02.426 --> 00:39:03.427
Leroy?

531
00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:07.931
What you done did now, Minny?

532
00:39:08.974 --> 00:39:11.435
- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!

533
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.021
Minny? Minny!

534
00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:16.523
Please! Please!

535
00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:17.733
Come here!

536
00:39:26.116 --> 00:39:29.912
Please open your Bibles to Exodus.

537
00:39:30.662 --> 00:39:33.457
Chapter four, verse ten.

538
00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:38.712
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

539
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.798
...Moses answered:

540
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:47.554
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

541
00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:53.060
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."

542
00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:59.608
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

543
00:39:59.733 --> 00:40:00.776
Amen!

544
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:03.070
Courage is daring to do what is right

545
00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:06.156
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

546
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.784
And God tells us,

547
00:40:09.576 --> 00:40:12.162
commands us, compels us,

548
00:40:12.496 --> 00:40:15.165
- to love. Amen?
- Amen.

549
00:40:17.084 --> 00:40:18.585
See, love,

550
00:40:18.752 --> 00:40:22.256
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

551
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:27.845
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way for your fellow man.

552
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:30.931
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

553
00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:35.936
your sister, your neighbour,
your friend and your enemy.

554
00:40:36.061 --> 00:40:40.065
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

555
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.276
Let's stand. All right.

556
00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:05.174
Quick. Come quick.

557
00:41:05.507 --> 00:41:08.719
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

558
00:41:08.844 --> 00:41:10.512
Got dropped two streets over?

559
00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:29.323
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

560
00:41:36.955 --> 00:41:38.790
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

561
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:42.169
You look really nice.

562
00:41:43.253 --> 00:41:44.630
Thank you.

563
00:42:02.856 --> 00:42:05.734
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

564
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:09.238
Miss Skeeter...

565
00:42:12.032 --> 00:42:16.787
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

566
00:42:18.288 --> 00:42:20.040
This isn't about me.

567
00:42:21.792 --> 00:42:23.252
It doesn't matter how I feel.

568
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.888
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

569
00:42:36.306 --> 00:42:38.350
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

570
00:42:40.269 --> 00:42:42.271
That gonna be hard.

571
00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:44.147
What about Minny?

572
00:42:44.273 --> 00:42:45.941
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

573
00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:49.945
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

574
00:42:53.073 --> 00:42:55.742
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

575
00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:58.787
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

576
00:43:01.665 --> 00:43:03.083
It feel...

577
00:43:15.429 --> 00:43:16.763
Is that your son?

578
00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:23.812
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:25.647
Can we move on to the next question?

580
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:29.109
You don't have to call me ma'am.

581
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:31.778
Not here.

582
00:43:38.952 --> 00:43:41.288
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

583
00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:45.125
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

584
00:43:46.126 --> 00:43:50.797
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

585
00:43:55.135 --> 00:43:58.430
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

586
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:01.683
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

587
00:44:05.229 --> 00:44:06.772
OK.

588
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.233
Sure.

589
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.117
I don't say my prayers out loud.

590
00:44:19.243 --> 00:44:22.371
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

591
00:44:22.704 --> 00:44:27.751
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

592
00:44:27.876 --> 00:44:32.130
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

593
00:44:35.843 --> 00:44:37.094
Go ahead.

594
00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:49.857
"My first white baby to ever look after

595
00:44:50.023 --> 00:44:53.193
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

596
00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:57.364
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

597
00:44:58.073 --> 00:45:01.118
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

598
00:45:01.243 --> 00:45:03.912
Alton's mama died of lung disease."

599
00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:11.378
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

600
00:45:13.922 --> 00:45:16.758
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

601
00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:23.140
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

602
00:45:23.265 --> 00:45:25.309
Just ate him up.

603
00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:28.312
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

604
00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:36.236
You should have seen his face.

605
00:45:48.582 --> 00:45:51.251
This was just so great.

606
00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:56.465
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

607
00:45:57.883 --> 00:45:59.426
What changed your mind?

608
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.304
God.

609
00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:06.433
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

610
00:46:19.613 --> 00:46:24.326
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr William something.

611
00:46:27.913 --> 00:46:31.959
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honour roll.

612
00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:36.046
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

613
00:46:38.048 --> 00:46:41.134
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

614
00:46:44.012 --> 00:46:48.141
I am late. I gotta get going.

615
00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:52.312
See you tonight, honey.

616
00:46:52.437 --> 00:46:53.480
OK.

617
00:46:55.983 --> 00:46:57.109
Go on.

618
00:47:00.487 --> 00:47:03.407
Well, now we're...

619
00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:06.326
...faced with having to choose

620
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:09.162
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

621
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.000
Would you consider giving us a loan?

622
00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:19.006
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

623
00:47:19.131 --> 00:47:23.135
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

624
00:47:25.512 --> 00:47:27.139
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:35.272
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favour.

626
00:47:37.065 --> 00:47:41.236
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

627
00:47:42.362 --> 00:47:46.200
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

628
00:47:48.368 --> 00:47:50.412
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:47:50.537 --> 00:47:52.122
You'll thank me one day.

630
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:58.045
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

631
00:47:58.629 --> 00:48:00.923
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

632
00:48:01.048 --> 00:48:02.341
might as well throw it all out.

633
00:48:02.466 --> 00:48:03.592
Spoon, too.

634
00:48:03.926 --> 00:48:07.095
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

635
00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:08.722
And you put it up in the cabinet.

636
00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:11.600
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

637
00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:13.560
Don't do it and see what happens.

638
00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.437
Morning, ladies.

639
00:48:15.562 --> 00:48:17.314
When you're serving white folks coffee,

640
00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:18.690
set it down in front of them.

641
00:48:19.024 --> 00:48:21.568
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

642
00:48:22.402 --> 00:48:25.155
And don't hit on they children.

643
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.741
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

644
00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:31.578
And last thing. Come here.

645
00:48:32.996 --> 00:48:34.164
Look at me.

646
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.583
No sass-mouthing.

647
00:48:38.669 --> 00:48:41.171
No sass-mouthing.

648
00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:43.090
I mean it.

649
00:48:48.262 --> 00:48:49.513
Give your mama a kiss.

650
00:48:52.266 --> 00:48:56.645
Leroy had made Sugar quit school
to help him with the bills.

651
00:49:00.566 --> 00:49:04.111
And every day Minny
went without a job,

652
00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:07.030
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

653
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.203
Good morning, everybody.

654
00:49:20.127 --> 00:49:21.336
But I knew.

655
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:25.716
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

656
00:49:37.519 --> 00:49:39.146
Come on!

657
00:49:39.313 --> 00:49:43.650
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No sass-mouthing.

658
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:48.322
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

659
00:49:52.492 --> 00:49:54.411
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

660
00:49:54.536 --> 00:49:56.288
I'm Minny Jackson.

661
00:49:57.789 --> 00:50:00.834
You... cooking something?

662
00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:05.506
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

663
00:50:05.672 --> 00:50:09.468
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

664
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:13.222
Come on.

665
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:17.351
This here is the kitchen.

666
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.812
What in the hell?

667
00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:26.652
I guess I got some learning to do.

668
00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:30.489
You sure do.

669
00:50:30.614 --> 00:50:33.659
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

670
00:50:33.784 --> 00:50:36.787
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

671
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.122
But if I had it my way,

672
00:50:39.248 --> 00:50:44.169
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

673
00:50:44.294 --> 00:50:46.421
None of this old stuff.

674
00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.799
The main house has
five beds and baths,

675
00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:53.387
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

676
00:50:53.512 --> 00:50:55.639
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

677
00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:57.850
filling up all these empty beds?

678
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.645
I'm pregnant now.

679
00:51:02.813 --> 00:51:06.400
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

680
00:51:07.442 --> 00:51:10.362
I know. It's an awful lot to do.

681
00:51:11.405 --> 00:51:14.449
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

682
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.161
Let me at least get you some bus money.

683
00:51:18.287 --> 00:51:21.623
Now... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

684
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:26.253
Wait. So you'll do it?

685
00:51:32.676 --> 00:51:34.428
No hugging. No hugging.

686
00:51:35.596 --> 00:51:39.850
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

687
00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:42.436
Come on.

688
00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:52.196
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

689
00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:54.364
We gots to talk about
some things first.

690
00:51:58.535 --> 00:52:00.245
I work Sunday through Friday.

691
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:03.373
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

692
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:06.793
OK. What time you want me here?

693
00:52:07.961 --> 00:52:11.798
After 9.00, and you gotta leave
before 4.00.

694
00:52:12.966 --> 00:52:14.301
OK.

695
00:52:14.426 --> 00:52:16.178
Now...

696
00:52:16.303 --> 00:52:17.804
What your husband say you can pay?

697
00:52:19.515 --> 00:52:21.600
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

698
00:52:21.725 --> 00:52:23.810
And what Mr Johnny gonna do
when he come home

699
00:52:23.936 --> 00:52:26.271
and find a coloured woman in his house?

700
00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:29.233
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

701
00:52:29.358 --> 00:52:31.693
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

702
00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:36.281
I really need a maid.

703
00:52:38.283 --> 00:52:40.577
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9.15.

704
00:52:42.663 --> 00:52:43.789
Great.

705
00:52:46.959 --> 00:52:48.252
Miss Celia?

706
00:52:50.003 --> 00:52:51.880
I think you done burned up your cake.

707
00:52:54.967 --> 00:52:56.510
Doggone it!

708
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:04.768
OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?

709
00:53:05.853 --> 00:53:11.024
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

710
00:53:11.358 --> 00:53:16.363
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

711
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:22.327
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

712
00:53:22.452 --> 00:53:25.998
every raffle slot for baked goods!

713
00:53:27.833 --> 00:53:31.420
Think we can put a dent in African
children's hunger this year?

714
00:53:32.504 --> 00:53:34.548
A big dent!

715
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:38.802
Now...

716
00:53:38.927 --> 00:53:41.638
...I just found out
the surgeon general

717
00:53:41.763 --> 00:53:45.267
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

718
00:53:45.392 --> 00:53:48.937
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

719
00:53:50.022 --> 00:53:53.567
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

720
00:53:53.692 --> 00:53:55.402
I gave it to you a month ago.

721
00:53:55.569 --> 00:53:57.571
I gave that to you myself.

722
00:53:57.905 --> 00:54:00.574
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

723
00:54:05.495 --> 00:54:07.414
I'll have it in there real soon.

724
00:54:10.417 --> 00:54:11.627
Great.

725
00:54:19.927 --> 00:54:21.637
Sorry I'm late.

726
00:54:30.354 --> 00:54:31.355
Thanks.

727
00:54:36.401 --> 00:54:39.571
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

728
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:41.949
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

729
00:54:43.909 --> 00:54:45.661
Oh, it's fine.

730
00:54:47.955 --> 00:54:50.457
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

731
00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:52.876
Thank you, Henry.

732
00:54:53.001 --> 00:54:54.628
You remembered.

733
00:54:54.753 --> 00:54:56.004
You're welcome.

734
00:54:58.632 --> 00:55:00.634
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

735
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:03.971
He's coming.

736
00:55:04.721 --> 00:55:07.641
Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

737
00:55:07.808 --> 00:55:12.604
Well, he's cancelled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

738
00:55:12.729 --> 00:55:14.982
Don't you dare say that.

739
00:55:15.148 --> 00:55:16.942
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

740
00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:19.444
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

741
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:22.739
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

742
00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:28.662
Saturday night.

743
00:56:07.075 --> 00:56:09.536
Good morning.

744
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:12.581
Good morning, Baby Girl.

745
00:56:12.706 --> 00:56:14.958
Good morning.

746
00:56:27.554 --> 00:56:29.765
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

747
00:56:32.851 --> 00:56:35.979
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

748
00:56:36.104 --> 00:56:38.524
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

749
00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:41.527
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

750
00:56:42.778 --> 00:56:45.447
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

751
00:56:46.114 --> 00:56:49.576
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

752
00:56:50.536 --> 00:56:53.163
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

753
00:56:56.124 --> 00:56:58.001
That's very true.

754
00:57:01.922 --> 00:57:03.882
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

755
00:57:08.262 --> 00:57:09.555
Write that down.

756
00:57:16.645 --> 00:57:19.189
Treelore would like me doing this.

757
00:57:19.523 --> 00:57:22.150
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

758
00:57:22.484 --> 00:57:24.820
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

759
00:57:25.904 --> 00:57:27.865
Aibileen, Aibileen.

760
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.826
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

761
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:43.088
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

762
00:57:45.924 --> 00:57:48.969
And just what makes you think
coloured people need your help?

763
00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:51.722
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

764
00:57:51.847 --> 00:57:53.682
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

765
00:57:53.807 --> 00:57:55.309
No.

766
00:57:55.642 --> 00:57:57.936
I want to show her perspective.

767
00:57:58.061 --> 00:58:01.815
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

768
00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.651
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

769
00:58:05.152 --> 00:58:08.530
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

770
00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:11.283
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

771
00:58:11.617 --> 00:58:16.079
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

772
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.001
And how we love they children
when they little.

773
00:58:21.835 --> 00:58:24.963
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

774
00:58:25.088 --> 00:58:26.131
I know.

775
00:58:28.175 --> 00:58:29.760
Maybe things can change.

776
00:58:29.885 --> 00:58:31.970
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

777
00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:33.722
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

778
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:35.557
You damn right I don't!

779
00:58:36.225 --> 00:58:38.268
You two give me the heart palpitations.

780
00:58:42.856 --> 00:58:44.066
And that's a good mood.

781
00:58:56.036 --> 00:58:58.580
All right. I'm gonna do it.

782
00:58:58.705 --> 00:59:02.709
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

783
00:59:04.711 --> 00:59:07.214
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

784
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.887
I need to see you square on
at all times.

785
00:59:23.856 --> 00:59:25.858
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

786
00:59:28.277 --> 00:59:31.989
Let's begin with where you were born.

787
00:59:32.114 --> 00:59:35.909
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

788
00:59:36.076 --> 00:59:37.160
Next.

789
00:59:37.286 --> 00:59:39.746
I put the green beans in first.

790
00:59:39.913 --> 00:59:43.000
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

791
00:59:43.125 --> 00:59:46.753
Once Minny got to talking about food,
she liked to never stop.

792
00:59:48.338 --> 00:59:52.092
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

793
00:59:52.259 --> 00:59:56.847
Then she say, "Oh, Minny, I'm gonna
give you a paid vacation."

794
00:59:56.972 --> 00:59:59.433
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

795
00:59:59.766 --> 01:00:02.352
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

796
01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:06.899
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

797
01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:09.067
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

798
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:16.325
We gots to get some more maids.

799
01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:19.953
It hard. You go try and see.

800
01:00:22.164 --> 01:00:23.790
OK, I will.

801
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.798
We gone and done it now.

802
01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:39.264
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

803
01:00:54.947 --> 01:00:55.948
What is that?

804
01:00:56.073 --> 01:00:59.826
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

805
01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:03.372
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

806
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.212
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

807
01:01:11.964 --> 01:01:15.300
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

808
01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:17.886
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

809
01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:22.891
Holy shit.

810
01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:25.519
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

811
01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.855
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

812
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.025
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

813
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:33.402
Can I take the Cadillac?

814
01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:35.863
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

815
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.116
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

816
01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:41.910
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

817
01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:43.036
I'll drive slow.

818
01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.998
Skeeter! Skeeter!

819
01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:51.003
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

820
01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:54.339
Don't mope! Smile!

821
01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:59.928
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

822
01:02:01.096 --> 01:02:02.472
I love you!

823
01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.525
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

824
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.403
Hey.

825
01:02:18.864 --> 01:02:20.115
Skeeter.

826
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:26.413
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

827
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.415
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

828
01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.875
Yes, ma'am.

829
01:02:44.056 --> 01:02:45.057
Want a drink?

830
01:02:45.182 --> 01:02:47.017
Just water, please.

831
01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:52.356
Double Old Kentucky, straight with
a water back. Make that two backs.

832
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.400
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

833
01:02:56.235 --> 01:02:58.946
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

834
01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:06.036
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

835
01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:08.330
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

836
01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.546
So, what do you do with your time?

837
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.923
You work?

838
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:20.092
I write.

839
01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:23.512
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

840
01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:24.930
for The Jackson Journal.

841
01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:28.141
You mean housekeeping.

842
01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:32.938
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

843
01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:34.940
except for maybe writing one.

844
01:03:35.065 --> 01:03:36.567
Well, I can.

845
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.904
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

846
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:44.449
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

847
01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:48.287
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

848
01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:51.582
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

849
01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.500
...professional husband hunting?

850
01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:56.545
Who is hungry?

851
01:03:56.879 --> 01:04:00.340
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

852
01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:02.217
Or were you just born stupid?

853
01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.200
So, what can you cook?

854
01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:30.537
I can cook cornpone.

855
01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:33.290
Boil potatoes.

856
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:35.501
I can do grits.

857
01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:40.047
Well...

858
01:04:41.006 --> 01:04:44.927
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

859
01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:48.138
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

860
01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:52.226
You got gum in your hair,

861
01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:54.561
you got a squeaky door hinge...

862
01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:55.687
Crisco.

863
01:04:57.481 --> 01:04:59.191
How pretty.

864
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:03.070
Looks like frosting.

865
01:05:03.195 --> 01:05:06.073
You got bags under your eyes.

866
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.200
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

867
01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:10.994
Crisco.

868
01:05:12.329 --> 01:05:15.374
But it's best for frying chicken.

869
01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:18.293
Frying chicken just...

870
01:05:19.419 --> 01:05:21.505
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

871
01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:26.468
At least me, anyway.

872
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.514
I love me some fried chicken.

873
01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:33.267
Now...

874
01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:36.395
...shake that.

875
01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:45.571
This is so much fun!

876
01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:50.450
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

877
01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:55.581
Yep. He dead.

878
01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:08.177
There you are.

879
01:06:09.469 --> 01:06:14.349
I'm starved. Looks so good.

880
01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:16.560
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

881
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:20.606
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

882
01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:21.773
Let me take your plate back.

883
01:06:22.608 --> 01:06:24.651
I'm fine right here, Minny.

884
01:06:44.296 --> 01:06:45.297
What?

885
01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.842
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

886
01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:51.762
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

887
01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:56.558
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

888
01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:58.143
Now Mr Johnny gonna catch me here,

889
01:06:58.268 --> 01:07:01.146
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

890
01:07:02.189 --> 01:07:03.232
You gots to tell him.

891
01:07:03.357 --> 01:07:06.235
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

892
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.070
You're right.

893
01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:11.740
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

894
01:07:13.825 --> 01:07:15.536
Minny don't burn chicken.

895
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.834
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

896
01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:25.671
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

897
01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:27.256
So you liked it?

898
01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:30.092
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

899
01:07:30.217 --> 01:07:33.220
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

900
01:07:33.345 --> 01:07:34.721
This many Negroes and whites

901
01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:37.224
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

902
01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:40.185
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

903
01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.312
The ones you've read.

904
01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:45.607
Two domestics, that's all?

905
01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.443
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

906
01:07:48.569 --> 01:07:52.573
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

907
01:07:52.739 --> 01:07:55.576
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

908
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:58.620
I don't know. At least a dozen.

909
01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:02.249
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

910
01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:04.626
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

911
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.503
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

912
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:20.934
We need a dozen more.

913
01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:26.189
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

914
01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:29.151
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

915
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.154
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

916
01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.283
I gots plenty stories, Miss Skeeter.

917
01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:39.870
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

918
01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:42.622
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

919
01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:46.710
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

920
01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:48.295
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

921
01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:49.962
It wouldn't be real.

922
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:53.216
They killed my son.

923
01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:03.268
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

924
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:06.939
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

925
01:09:11.944 --> 01:09:14.738
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

926
01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.492
Drove to the coloured hospital...

927
01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:20.577
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

928
01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:35.341
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

929
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:42.349
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

930
01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:47.854
He died right in front of me.

931
01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:54.027
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

932
01:09:55.696 --> 01:09:59.366
Anniversary of his death comes...

933
01:09:59.533 --> 01:10:01.827
...every year, and I can't breathe.

934
01:10:01.952 --> 01:10:04.329
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

935
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:10.252
You stop this...

936
01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:15.340
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

937
01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:28.687
I am just honoured to be hosting
Elizabeth's shower.

938
01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:31.648
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

939
01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:33.692
Yes, she does!

940
01:10:33.817 --> 01:10:36.862
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

941
01:10:37.905 --> 01:10:39.907
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

942
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:44.036
I'm hungry, Mommy.

943
01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:46.288
She's always hungry.

944
01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:49.958
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

945
01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:54.505
I'll cut you a piece of cake, baby.
Go on, now.

946
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:03.430
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's?

947
01:11:03.555 --> 01:11:07.351
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

948
01:11:11.772 --> 01:11:15.025
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

949
01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:17.903
Separate, but equal.

950
01:11:18.654 --> 01:11:20.989
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

951
01:11:21.323 --> 01:11:25.494
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

952
01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:45.138
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

953
01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:46.473
No, thanks.

954
01:11:47.683 --> 01:11:49.977
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

955
01:11:52.646 --> 01:11:54.815
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

956
01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.111
Minny and Aibileen already did.

957
01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:06.910
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

958
01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:11.832
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

959
01:12:11.957 --> 01:12:14.626
...but my boys are worth more.

960
01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.503
I understand.

961
01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.760
What do you understand, Skeeter?

962
01:12:25.846 --> 01:12:30.559
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

963
01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:33.979
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

964
01:12:34.855 --> 01:12:36.106
Of course not.

965
01:12:38.442 --> 01:12:40.444
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

966
01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:43.739
Excuse me.

967
01:12:46.783 --> 01:12:48.035
Come on, baby.

968
01:12:55.792 --> 01:13:00.589
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

969
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:04.551
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

970
01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:06.553
I know.

971
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.224
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

972
01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:13.143
I'm worried about you.

973
01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:15.854
Reading this stuff?

974
01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.692
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

975
01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:23.612
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

976
01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:25.739
you'd be in serious trouble.

977
01:13:27.658 --> 01:13:29.201
I'll be on the lookout.

978
01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.582
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

979
01:13:39.086 --> 01:13:40.462
OK?

980
01:14:29.887 --> 01:14:32.055
Skeeter, get up!

981
01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:34.641
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

982
01:14:36.268 --> 01:14:37.561
What's wrong?

983
01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.980
Don't panic. Don't panic.

984
01:14:40.105 --> 01:14:44.985
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

985
01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:47.946
Oh, God.

986
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.073
Oh, mother.

987
01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:52.826
You would not like him. Trust me.

988
01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:54.161
He's a drunken asshole.

989
01:14:54.328 --> 01:14:58.665
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

990
01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:00.918
Put that on. Hurry!

991
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.051
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

992
01:15:09.176 --> 01:15:13.138
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

993
01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:15.224
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

994
01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:16.683
Neither.

995
01:15:16.808 --> 01:15:19.102
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

996
01:15:19.228 --> 01:15:21.188
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

997
01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.983
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

998
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.781
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

999
01:15:35.202 --> 01:15:37.788
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

1000
01:15:37.913 --> 01:15:39.206
I'm sure she did.

1001
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:41.875
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1002
01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:47.714
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

1003
01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:50.884
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

1004
01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:52.386
Ever?

1005
01:15:53.637 --> 01:15:54.638
Ever.

1006
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.267
All right, I...

1007
01:16:00.894 --> 01:16:02.229
Well, that must be it, then.

1008
01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:03.856
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

1009
01:16:03.981 --> 01:16:06.316
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

1010
01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:09.278
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

1011
01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:13.282
You make me laugh, smile.

1012
01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:18.704
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

1013
01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:23.834
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

1014
01:16:24.793 --> 01:16:26.753
I can't think of anything worse.

1015
01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:32.968
I understand, and I'm sorry. That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

1016
01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:41.310
Just give me a minute.

1017
01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:44.313
Let me get my sweater.

1018
01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:51.361
Not a big fan of oysters?

1019
01:16:51.695 --> 01:16:54.281
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

1020
01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:58.327
Well, here's to new beginnings.

1021
01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:08.837
You're disgusting.

1022
01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:10.464
You've already made that pretty clear.

1023
01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:14.218
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

1024
01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:16.303
your Miss Myrna column
on the rig the other day.

1025
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:19.056
Really? You read them?

1026
01:17:19.181 --> 01:17:20.182
All of them.

1027
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:22.476
Very informative, too.

1028
01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:25.437
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

1029
01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:27.105
Well, I do my homework.

1030
01:17:33.153 --> 01:17:34.905
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

1031
01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.324
Thank you.

1032
01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:41.787
I want to be a journalist.

1033
01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:45.958
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

1034
01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.043
I like that.

1035
01:17:50.337 --> 01:17:52.798
You're really smart. And pretty.

1036
01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:02.975
Skeeter.

1037
01:18:04.226 --> 01:18:06.019
I hope you get to write something
really good.

1038
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:08.730
Something you believe in.

1039
01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:22.077
Hello?

1040
01:18:24.288 --> 01:18:26.915
What? I'm coming!

1041
01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:31.003
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

1042
01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:38.760
You're trespassing!

1043
01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:42.764
It's Skeeter!
She put it in the newsletter.

1044
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.308
Oh, my God.

1045
01:18:44.433 --> 01:18:48.896
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house."

1046
01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:51.064
Not commodes!

1047
01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:53.066
Why would she do this to me?

1048
01:18:53.233 --> 01:18:55.068
I don't know. I don't know, Hilly.

1049
01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:57.946
It's so embarrassing.

1050
01:19:05.996 --> 01:19:07.581
Oh, Lord.

1051
01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.208
I go potty, Mommy.

1052
01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:12.252
No! Mae Mobley!

1053
01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:14.421
You get off of that toilet!

1054
01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.383
You will catch diseases, do you hear me?

1055
01:19:18.509 --> 01:19:20.511
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

1056
01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:38.403
You is kind, you is smart,

1057
01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:40.906
you is important.

1058
01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:54.253
Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.

1059
01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:59.299
Let's let the merchants down on Capitol
Street feel the economic pinch.

1060
01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:01.343
Let me say this to you.

1061
01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:04.263
I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,

1062
01:20:04.388 --> 01:20:09.101
"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,

1063
01:20:09.226 --> 01:20:12.479
and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business."

1064
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:17.609
These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,

1065
01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:22.114
the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.

1066
01:20:22.656 --> 01:20:24.116
Mama!

1067
01:20:26.994 --> 01:20:28.412
Don't encourage them like that.

1068
01:20:28.537 --> 01:20:31.039
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

1069
01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:35.210
You understand?

1070
01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:47.014
How you doing, Miss Clark?

1071
01:20:48.515 --> 01:20:51.185
All right, Henry.

1072
01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:53.228
Thank you. How you doing?

1073
01:20:54.521 --> 01:20:58.317
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

1074
01:20:58.442 --> 01:20:59.985
That's good.

1075
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:02.029
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1076
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:11.663
What's going on out there, mister?

1077
01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:13.957
Coloured people off.

1078
01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:15.542
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

1079
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:17.002
I'll get you close as I can.

1080
01:21:17.127 --> 01:21:18.587
What happened?

1081
01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:20.547
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

1082
01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.550
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

1083
01:21:23.675 --> 01:21:25.636
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1084
01:21:34.937 --> 01:21:38.565
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1085
01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:41.276
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1086
01:21:42.402 --> 01:21:43.654
You have a good night.

1087
01:21:44.404 --> 01:21:46.156
Which way you going?

1088
01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:59.253
We view this as a cold,
brutal, deliberate...

1089
01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:04.591
...killing in a savage,
uncivilised state.

1090
01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:10.055
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

1091
01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.434
in inhumanity, murder, brutality

1092
01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.019
and racial hatred.

1093
01:22:16.603 --> 01:22:20.357
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

1094
01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:23.068
Fifteen minutes past midnight,

1095
01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:26.989
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

1096
01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:29.074
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away,

1097
01:22:29.199 --> 01:22:32.536
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

1098
01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:35.122
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1099
01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:36.748
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

1100
01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:39.793
crashed through his body,
through a window, into the house.

1101
01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:42.462
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

1102
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:45.090
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

1103
01:22:45.215 --> 01:22:49.219
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1104
01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:52.806
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1105
01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:57.477
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1106
01:22:57.644 --> 01:23:01.106
We living in hell. Trapped.

1107
01:23:02.065 --> 01:23:04.026
Our kids, trapped.

1108
01:23:06.778 --> 01:23:09.364
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1109
01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.622
Good night.

1110
01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:19.208
Good night. Good night.

1111
01:23:22.377 --> 01:23:23.670
Good night, baby.

1112
01:23:35.474 --> 01:23:37.434
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1113
01:23:38.435 --> 01:23:39.728
We're gonna be careful.

1114
01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:45.734
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1115
01:23:46.068 --> 01:23:48.487
We ain't doing civil rights.

1116
01:23:48.612 --> 01:23:51.532
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1117
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:55.285
You're a fool, old woman.

1118
01:23:57.079 --> 01:23:58.413
A fool.

1119
01:24:29.403 --> 01:24:33.866
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

1120
01:24:34.575 --> 01:24:35.576
Yes, sir.

1121
01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:37.327
Chop-chop.

1122
01:24:38.579 --> 01:24:40.163
Good Lord.

1123
01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:57.598
Miss Celia?

1124
01:25:15.490 --> 01:25:18.368
- Miss Celia?
- Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

1125
01:25:18.493 --> 01:25:20.787
You mess up your hair colouring again?

1126
01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:24.625
I helped you fix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1127
01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:26.460
Was real pretty, remember?

1128
01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:31.757
Miss Celia.

1129
01:25:32.841 --> 01:25:34.718
I told you, go home!

1130
01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:52.444
I said get out!

1131
01:26:08.252 --> 01:26:10.671
Why is there so much blood?

1132
01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:20.305
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1133
01:26:22.558 --> 01:26:25.310
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1134
01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:29.898
Then I lost it a month later.

1135
01:26:32.526 --> 01:26:34.528
Johnny wants kids now.

1136
01:26:37.948 --> 01:26:39.741
What's he gonna do with me?

1137
01:26:42.786 --> 01:26:43.996
Well...

1138
01:26:45.539 --> 01:26:47.624
Mr Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1139
01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.004
He doesn't know about the baby.

1140
01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:58.260
Or the two before.

1141
01:27:52.981 --> 01:27:54.441
Yule Mae Davis?

1142
01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:59.613
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1143
01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:04.076
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1144
01:28:07.829 --> 01:28:11.083
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1145
01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:15.045
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1146
01:28:15.879 --> 01:28:17.339
Don't fight, Yule Mae!

1147
01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:22.427
I want my purse! I want my purse!

1148
01:28:26.348 --> 01:28:28.100
Just let me go!

1149
01:28:28.934 --> 01:28:31.144
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1150
01:28:39.778 --> 01:28:42.865
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1151
01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.870
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and colour.

1152
01:28:49.162 --> 01:28:52.416
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1153
01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:58.130
I am desperate for a grilled cheese
sandwich. Are you? Are you?

1154
01:28:58.463 --> 01:29:00.716
- Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?
- Oh, yes.

1155
01:29:01.175 --> 01:29:03.051
Just go sit down over there.

1156
01:29:09.683 --> 01:29:14.021
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1157
01:29:14.855 --> 01:29:15.856
Now.

1158
01:29:46.428 --> 01:29:48.555
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1159
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:51.141
I'm gonna help, too.

1160
01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:55.187
We all are.

1161
01:29:55.521 --> 01:29:58.482
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

1162
01:29:59.775 --> 01:30:05.072
I used to take a shortcut every day when
I went to work at Dr Dixon's house.

1163
01:30:05.781 --> 01:30:08.825
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1164
01:30:08.951 --> 01:30:12.829
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1165
01:30:12.955 --> 01:30:16.625
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1166
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:23.465
Dr Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1167
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:26.468
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1168
01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:31.974
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1169
01:30:33.225 --> 01:30:34.601
He did.

1170
01:30:34.726 --> 01:30:37.771
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1171
01:30:38.647 --> 01:30:42.067
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1172
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:45.571
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1173
01:30:46.572 --> 01:30:50.868
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1174
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:54.788
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1175
01:30:54.913 --> 01:30:56.540
Mean for sport.

1176
01:30:58.792 --> 01:31:01.545
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1177
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:04.715
But in everybody's mind

1178
01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.135
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1179
01:31:10.304 --> 01:31:11.763
Owned me.

1180
01:31:17.561 --> 01:31:19.188
I leave early this week
for Thanksgiving.

1181
01:31:19.521 --> 01:31:22.149
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1182
01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:24.109
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1183
01:31:24.234 --> 01:31:27.237
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1184
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:29.990
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1185
01:31:30.115 --> 01:31:32.951
You do not want it in the pile.

1186
01:31:33.076 --> 01:31:34.161
Yes, ma'am.

1187
01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:37.748
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1188
01:31:39.041 --> 01:31:40.334
I understand.

1189
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:50.886
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1190
01:31:51.011 --> 01:31:54.014
I know, but I think we're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1191
01:32:01.813 --> 01:32:03.315
It's so good.

1192
01:32:04.024 --> 01:32:05.901
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1193
01:32:06.735 --> 01:32:07.736
Aibileen?

1194
01:32:10.155 --> 01:32:14.117
Hey, Elizabeth! It's me, Celia Foote.

1195
01:32:16.328 --> 01:32:19.873
I was in the neighbourhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1196
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:24.211
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1197
01:32:25.128 --> 01:32:27.339
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1198
01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:32.886
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1199
01:32:37.891 --> 01:32:39.309
Hey!

1200
01:32:45.816 --> 01:32:47.067
I brought a chocolate pie!

1201
01:32:49.361 --> 01:32:51.738
My maid, Minny, made it.

1202
01:32:59.037 --> 01:33:01.248
She's in the bushes.

1203
01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:27.900
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1204
01:33:36.116 --> 01:33:39.661
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1205
01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:42.873
Why, Minny?

1206
01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:48.879
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr Johnny.

1207
01:33:49.004 --> 01:33:50.964
Mad you married one of their mens.

1208
01:33:51.798 --> 01:33:55.761
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr Johnny had just broke up, too.

1209
01:33:55.886 --> 01:33:58.305
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1210
01:33:58.472 --> 01:34:00.182
when they were still going steady.

1211
01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:06.939
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr Johnny, too.

1212
01:34:08.815 --> 01:34:10.234
No wonder!

1213
01:34:13.237 --> 01:34:17.366
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1214
01:34:18.283 --> 01:34:20.994
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1215
01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:24.081
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1216
01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:28.418
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1217
01:34:29.711 --> 01:34:31.964
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1218
01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:36.760
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1219
01:34:40.848 --> 01:34:42.015
That looks bad.

1220
01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:45.769
Let me take a look.

1221
01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:48.188
I got to get these peas on.

1222
01:34:48.355 --> 01:34:51.149
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1223
01:35:12.379 --> 01:35:15.007
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1224
01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.886
I'd give it right back to him.

1225
01:35:20.304 --> 01:35:23.223
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1226
01:35:23.348 --> 01:35:26.143
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell."

1227
01:35:36.486 --> 01:35:38.947
From here, the members of the family...

1228
01:35:42.242 --> 01:35:45.537
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1229
01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:48.874
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1230
01:35:55.297 --> 01:35:58.133
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1231
01:36:00.177 --> 01:36:01.428
Mrs Kennedy.

1232
01:36:02.971 --> 01:36:04.973
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1233
01:36:05.098 --> 01:36:07.184
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1234
01:36:08.435 --> 01:36:10.103
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1235
01:36:22.366 --> 01:36:24.910
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1236
01:36:25.494 --> 01:36:28.914
What if people find out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1237
01:36:29.039 --> 01:36:30.290
figure out who who?

1238
01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.420
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1239
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:41.385
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1240
01:36:42.553 --> 01:36:44.388
But we ain't got no choice.

1241
01:36:45.973 --> 01:36:46.974
Sorry.

1242
01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.979
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1243
01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:55.482
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1244
01:37:07.494 --> 01:37:08.871
So...

1245
01:37:10.539 --> 01:37:13.417
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1246
01:37:16.336 --> 01:37:17.462
Did they?

1247
01:37:25.637 --> 01:37:27.431
Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1248
01:37:27.556 --> 01:37:29.349
I'm glad you like it.

1249
01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:39.193
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1250
01:37:39.359 --> 01:37:40.903
Take me back?

1251
01:37:43.322 --> 01:37:47.117
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1252
01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:50.037
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1253
01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:52.706
...and something else real special.

1254
01:37:55.667 --> 01:38:00.005
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1255
01:38:03.008 --> 01:38:04.343
Mama can have a piece.

1256
01:38:07.095 --> 01:38:08.388
Cut her one.

1257
01:38:10.224 --> 01:38:11.475
Go get a plate.

1258
01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:17.606
Eat my shit.

1259
01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:23.320
What'd you say?

1260
01:38:23.987 --> 01:38:27.491
I said, "Eat... my... shit."

1261
01:38:36.959 --> 01:38:38.418
Have you lost your mind?

1262
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:45.425
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1263
01:38:46.176 --> 01:38:48.679
Did what?

1264
01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:14.246
And you didn't eat just one.
You had two slices!

1265
01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:27.134
Run, Minny, run!

1266
01:39:31.597 --> 01:39:33.265
You trying to get yourself killed?

1267
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:36.310
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1268
01:39:38.312 --> 01:39:40.147
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1269
01:39:41.398 --> 01:39:45.319
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1270
01:39:46.486 --> 01:39:49.239
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1271
01:39:52.242 --> 01:39:54.161
I done ask God to forgive me.

1272
01:39:56.163 --> 01:39:59.041
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1273
01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:05.672
Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing
home... just for laughing.

1274
01:40:07.508 --> 01:40:09.134
We can't put that story in the book.

1275
01:40:09.843 --> 01:40:11.345
We ain't got no choice.

1276
01:40:12.095 --> 01:40:15.516
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1277
01:40:15.641 --> 01:40:17.726
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1278
01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.270
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

1279
01:40:20.395 --> 01:40:22.481
Right! But don't you see?

1280
01:40:22.606 --> 01:40:25.859
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1281
01:40:26.193 --> 01:40:28.779
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1282
01:40:30.239 --> 01:40:31.532
No.

1283
01:40:32.574 --> 01:40:34.159
No, that's too dangerous.

1284
01:40:38.372 --> 01:40:41.708
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1285
01:40:42.584 --> 01:40:45.879
Either put it in, or pull my parts out
altogether. Y'all pick!

1286
01:40:57.391 --> 01:41:00.394
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10.00. See you then.

1287
01:41:05.899 --> 01:41:09.611
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

1288
01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:13.240
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

1289
01:41:13.365 --> 01:41:17.744
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

1290
01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:19.872
I'm absolutely thrilled.

1291
01:41:20.747 --> 01:41:22.416
Scandalous!

1292
01:41:25.127 --> 01:41:26.128
Thank you.

1293
01:41:36.597 --> 01:41:37.639
Hi!

1294
01:41:44.605 --> 01:41:46.356
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

1295
01:41:46.481 --> 01:41:49.776
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

1296
01:41:51.195 --> 01:41:53.363
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

1297
01:41:53.488 --> 01:41:55.240
and that's what she came up with?

1298
01:41:56.909 --> 01:41:58.285
Here.

1299
01:42:09.421 --> 01:42:10.547
Kiss me.

1300
01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.625
Everybody enjoying the evening?

1301
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:54.383
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

1302
01:42:58.011 --> 01:43:01.348
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

1303
01:43:03.016 --> 01:43:05.853
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

1304
01:43:08.438 --> 01:43:10.524
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

1305
01:43:13.277 --> 01:43:16.363
Honey, don't you think you've
had enough to drink?

1306
01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:18.282
I wish you'd try and eat something.

1307
01:43:18.407 --> 01:43:20.659
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

1308
01:43:24.538 --> 01:43:28.542
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

1309
01:43:30.544 --> 01:43:31.712
OK.

1310
01:43:31.879 --> 01:43:36.675
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

1311
01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:38.552
...Charlotte Phelan!

1312
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:44.892
Congrats, Miss Phelan. Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

1313
01:43:45.976 --> 01:43:49.521
Now it's time for the baked goods.

1314
01:43:51.398 --> 01:43:52.608
Yummy, yummy!

1315
01:43:52.733 --> 01:43:55.903
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

1316
01:43:56.069 --> 01:43:58.906
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

1317
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:02.367
Congratulations...

1318
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:04.661
...Hilly Holbrook!

1319
01:44:06.622 --> 01:44:09.291
- Hilly.
- That's funny.

1320
01:44:09.416 --> 01:44:10.959
I didn't bid on anything.

1321
01:44:11.293 --> 01:44:15.422
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

1322
01:44:18.842 --> 01:44:20.761
Congratulations, Hilly!

1323
01:44:20.886 --> 01:44:23.972
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

1324
01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:28.018
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

1325
01:44:28.352 --> 01:44:30.312
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

1326
01:44:30.437 --> 01:44:32.773
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

1327
01:44:33.774 --> 01:44:36.318
Wait. I want to talk...

1328
01:44:36.443 --> 01:44:37.778
Oh, no.

1329
01:44:37.903 --> 01:44:39.613
I'm so sorry.

1330
01:44:42.783 --> 01:44:44.618
Come here, sweetheart.

1331
01:44:44.743 --> 01:44:46.537
Let me bring you back to your table.

1332
01:44:48.914 --> 01:44:51.458
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1333
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:56.380
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

1334
01:44:56.505 --> 01:44:58.048
I don't know what you're talking about.

1335
01:44:58.382 --> 01:44:59.800
You liar! Who did you tell?

1336
01:44:59.967 --> 01:45:02.386
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1337
01:45:02.511 --> 01:45:05.055
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

1338
01:45:05.389 --> 01:45:08.725
Johnny never cheated on you.

1339
01:45:09.643 --> 01:45:11.353
At least not with me.

1340
01:45:12.521 --> 01:45:14.690
Johnny would never cheat on me.

1341
01:45:14.815 --> 01:45:18.151
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

1342
01:45:19.027 --> 01:45:24.074
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

1343
01:45:24.408 --> 01:45:26.451
Hey, that is enough.

1344
01:45:26.577 --> 01:45:27.578
Celia.

1345
01:45:27.703 --> 01:45:29.121
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

1346
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:38.881
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

1347
01:45:40.507 --> 01:45:43.010
Why don't we get back to the auction?

1348
01:45:43.177 --> 01:45:46.638
Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.

1349
01:45:46.763 --> 01:45:48.807
It goes great with hot cocoa.

1350
01:45:55.022 --> 01:45:56.857
Just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

1351
01:45:57.024 --> 01:46:00.402
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

1352
01:46:00.527 --> 01:46:02.863
You throw that pie away right now.

1353
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:05.115
I spent good money on this pie.

1354
01:46:06.033 --> 01:46:07.868
I won it just for you.

1355
01:46:08.035 --> 01:46:10.120
You signed me up?

1356
01:46:10.454 --> 01:46:14.499
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1357
01:46:14.625 --> 01:46:16.960
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1358
01:46:17.085 --> 01:46:20.714
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1359
01:46:20.881 --> 01:46:22.883
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1360
01:46:23.926 --> 01:46:25.052
Good night.

1361
01:46:29.431 --> 01:46:32.809
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1362
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:43.070
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1363
01:46:44.947 --> 01:46:48.075
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1364
01:46:48.951 --> 01:46:52.454
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1365
01:46:56.708 --> 01:46:58.961
I can't do this to Johnny anymore.

1366
01:47:01.505 --> 01:47:03.757
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1367
01:47:05.509 --> 01:47:07.678
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

1368
01:47:10.764 --> 01:47:11.932
Lord.

1369
01:47:12.641 --> 01:47:14.893
I reckon it's time you knew.

1370
01:47:15.018 --> 01:47:16.144
Sit down.

1371
01:47:26.947 --> 01:47:29.950
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1372
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:33.203
That you was making fun of her.

1373
01:47:36.206 --> 01:47:38.834
It's my fault she pounced on you.

1374
01:47:41.253 --> 01:47:43.255
If you leave Mr Johnny...

1375
01:47:45.716 --> 01:47:48.802
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1376
01:47:50.929 --> 01:47:52.806
Then she done beaten me...

1377
01:47:54.141 --> 01:47:56.185
...and she done beat you.

1378
01:48:03.233 --> 01:48:05.861
Thank you for telling me that.

1379
01:48:13.285 --> 01:48:16.997
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

1380
01:48:20.667 --> 01:48:23.545
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

1381
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:24.755
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

1382
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:29.676
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1383
01:48:29.843 --> 01:48:31.220
but other than that, we're done.

1384
01:48:31.553 --> 01:48:33.013
Which one you got left?

1385
01:48:35.641 --> 01:48:36.767
Mine.

1386
01:48:47.277 --> 01:48:49.863
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

1387
01:48:50.239 --> 01:48:54.243
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

1388
01:48:54.868 --> 01:48:56.036
What happened?

1389
01:48:59.289 --> 01:49:01.166
What happened?

1390
01:49:05.963 --> 01:49:08.048
She didn't give me a choice.

1391
01:49:13.178 --> 01:49:18.058
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

1392
01:49:20.936 --> 01:49:24.231
Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down

1393
01:49:24.356 --> 01:49:28.318
from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.

1394
01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:34.032
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

1395
01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:41.206
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

1396
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.128
Yes, ma'am.

1397
01:49:48.881 --> 01:49:52.176
It's such an honour
that you came all this way.

1398
01:50:00.976 --> 01:50:02.019
That's all right.

1399
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.775
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

1400
01:50:11.403 --> 01:50:13.780
We were expecting you next week.

1401
01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:15.908
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

1402
01:50:18.827 --> 01:50:20.120
I'm entertaining.

1403
01:50:20.287 --> 01:50:22.789
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

1404
01:50:28.295 --> 01:50:29.755
Go on now.

1405
01:50:32.883 --> 01:50:34.301
I am sorry.

1406
01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.973
Rachel, what are you doing?

1407
01:50:40.098 --> 01:50:43.310
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1408
01:50:43.435 --> 01:50:45.020
Going to the kitchen.

1409
01:50:45.145 --> 01:50:47.231
But I'm going to see my mama first.

1410
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.401
Hello, Mama.

1411
01:50:51.735 --> 01:50:54.321
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

1412
01:50:54.446 --> 01:50:58.784
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1413
01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:07.000
Get out of this house, Rachel.

1414
01:51:10.838 --> 01:51:13.382
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1415
01:51:13.715 --> 01:51:17.845
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1416
01:51:19.721 --> 01:51:21.056
Charlotte.

1417
01:51:25.394 --> 01:51:27.354
Both of you.

1418
01:51:27.479 --> 01:51:30.190
Leave. Now.

1419
01:51:34.319 --> 01:51:35.779
Come on, Mama.

1420
01:52:08.228 --> 01:52:09.855
Come on now.

1421
01:52:23.368 --> 01:52:25.954
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1422
01:52:27.539 --> 01:52:29.458
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1423
01:52:29.791 --> 01:52:32.920
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1424
01:52:33.921 --> 01:52:38.217
She did you the biggest favour of your
life. She taught me everything.

1425
01:52:38.342 --> 01:52:41.470
Well, you idolised her too much.
You always have.

1426
01:52:41.803 --> 01:52:43.931
I needed someone to look up to.

1427
01:52:49.436 --> 01:52:53.148
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1428
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:25.389
How could you not tell me all this?

1429
01:53:25.514 --> 01:53:29.142
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1430
01:53:29.268 --> 01:53:31.937
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1431
01:53:32.062 --> 01:53:33.480
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1432
01:53:33.605 --> 01:53:35.190
- Eugenia.
- What?

1433
01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:40.487
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1434
01:53:49.454 --> 01:53:50.998
When he got there...

1435
01:53:55.043 --> 01:53:56.503
...she had died.

1436
01:54:12.603 --> 01:54:14.688
You broke her heart.

1437
01:54:22.029 --> 01:54:25.282
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1438
01:54:28.368 --> 01:54:30.037
I'm sorry.

1439
01:55:25.717 --> 01:55:27.678
They printed a few thousand copies

1440
01:55:28.011 --> 01:55:31.265
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.

1441
01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:34.101
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

1442
01:55:35.185 --> 01:55:40.440
They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.

1443
01:55:41.316 --> 01:55:46.280
Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.

1444
01:55:52.327 --> 01:55:53.620
Y'all finish your homework.

1445
01:55:58.750 --> 01:56:01.420
Aibileen. Aibileen!

1446
01:56:02.296 --> 01:56:05.132
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

1447
01:56:05.299 --> 01:56:08.468
Look at it. Look at it!

1448
01:56:08.635 --> 01:56:10.262
Minny, we're rich!

1449
01:56:12.514 --> 01:56:16.101
"She fired me for using her
inside toilet.

1450
01:56:16.226 --> 01:56:21.023
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

1451
01:56:21.148 --> 01:56:25.319
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

1452
01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.613
I watched her eat..."

1453
01:56:38.123 --> 01:56:40.250
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

1454
01:56:40.375 --> 01:56:44.338
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

1455
01:56:45.172 --> 01:56:47.049
OK, Mama. I need to run.

1456
01:56:47.174 --> 01:56:51.845
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

1457
01:56:52.179 --> 01:56:55.641
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

1458
01:56:56.225 --> 01:56:57.518
Quite scandalous.

1459
01:56:58.769 --> 01:57:00.187
What book?

1460
01:57:00.312 --> 01:57:01.480
What's it called again?

1461
01:57:03.148 --> 01:57:05.692
The Help. H-E-L-P.

1462
01:57:33.554 --> 01:57:34.805
There it is.

1463
01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:45.232
You told me to write something good.
Something I believed in.

1464
01:57:45.399 --> 01:57:47.109
It's not what I believe in.

1465
01:57:47.234 --> 01:57:50.112
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

1466
01:57:51.572 --> 01:57:53.532
Why would you do this to us?

1467
01:57:54.533 --> 01:57:56.201
I don't even know why you care.

1468
01:57:56.326 --> 01:57:59.204
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

1469
01:57:59.329 --> 01:58:00.664
Why go stir up trouble?

1470
01:58:00.789 --> 01:58:03.292
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

1471
01:58:03.417 --> 01:58:05.419
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

1472
01:58:05.544 --> 01:58:08.422
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

1473
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.761
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

1474
01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.723
Stuart.

1475
01:58:17.848 --> 01:58:20.142
I think you're better off being alone.

1476
01:59:09.858 --> 01:59:12.653
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

1477
01:59:12.819 --> 01:59:14.696
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

1478
01:59:14.821 --> 01:59:17.282
"What you done put up in this?"

1479
01:59:17.407 --> 01:59:20.744
"She said, 'My shit.'"

1480
01:59:35.634 --> 01:59:37.261
What's the matter, Hilly?

1481
01:59:38.679 --> 01:59:41.014
Get off of me! Get off!

1482
01:59:41.348 --> 01:59:42.891
Stop hitting me!

1483
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.312
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

1484
01:59:48.272 --> 01:59:49.690
It's not Jackson.

1485
01:59:49.857 --> 01:59:54.361
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

1486
01:59:54.486 --> 01:59:56.405
And Jolene, didn't your mama

1487
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:58.532
leave Cora to you in her will?

1488
01:59:58.699 --> 02:00:02.619
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

1489
02:00:02.744 --> 02:00:05.539
The book is not about Jackson.

1490
02:01:30.457 --> 02:01:31.875
What the hell?

1491
02:01:33.335 --> 02:01:34.753
What are you doing here?

1492
02:01:37.506 --> 02:01:39.800
I've contacted my lawyer.
Hibbie Goodman?

1493
02:01:39.967 --> 02:01:41.677
He's the best libel attorney
in the state.

1494
02:01:41.802 --> 02:01:43.512
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

1495
02:01:43.637 --> 02:01:45.472
You can't prove anything.

1496
02:01:45.597 --> 02:01:48.851
I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

1497
02:01:48.976 --> 02:01:50.894
You don't know anything, Hilly.

1498
02:01:51.019 --> 02:01:52.646
I don't, do I?

1499
02:01:53.355 --> 02:01:56.400
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

1500
02:01:56.525 --> 02:01:59.444
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

1501
02:02:00.445 --> 02:02:03.490
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1502
02:02:03.657 --> 02:02:06.827
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1503
02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:09.663
before putting in about that
L-shaped scratch

1504
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:12.541
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1505
02:02:14.626 --> 02:02:18.463
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1506
02:02:19.006 --> 02:02:23.510
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

1507
02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:26.096
Don't give yourself away now.

1508
02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.182
That was not me!

1509
02:02:29.099 --> 02:02:31.435
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1510
02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.604
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1511
02:02:33.729 --> 02:02:37.441
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1512
02:02:37.566 --> 02:02:38.567
Mrs Phelan.

1513
02:02:38.692 --> 02:02:42.613
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1514
02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:44.531
No, ma'am.

1515
02:02:44.656 --> 02:02:49.620
Darling, no husband wants to come home
and see that.

1516
02:02:51.705 --> 02:02:53.081
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1517
02:02:53.415 --> 02:02:55.209
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1518
02:02:55.542 --> 02:02:59.046
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1519
02:03:03.634 --> 02:03:06.887
Mrs Phelan, I came here...

1520
02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:09.598
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1521
02:03:09.723 --> 02:03:11.892
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1522
02:03:12.643 --> 02:03:14.561
Go on.

1523
02:03:14.686 --> 02:03:17.731
Get off my property. Now!

1524
02:03:18.815 --> 02:03:22.027
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1525
02:03:37.501 --> 02:03:40.712
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1526
02:03:41.797 --> 02:03:42.798
Yes, ma'am.

1527
02:03:58.522 --> 02:04:01.525
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1528
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:03.777
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1529
02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:07.948
Because we are going shopping.

1530
02:04:09.908 --> 02:04:12.286
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1531
02:04:12.619 --> 02:04:14.079
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1532
02:04:14.204 --> 02:04:16.748
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1533
02:04:16.874 --> 02:04:18.166
How do you know about New York?

1534
02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.128
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1535
02:04:28.927 --> 02:04:31.847
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1536
02:04:34.808 --> 02:04:37.644
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1537
02:04:46.904 --> 02:04:48.989
I can't leave you like this.

1538
02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:52.701
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1539
02:04:52.826 --> 02:04:55.204
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1540
02:04:55.537 --> 02:04:58.665
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1541
02:04:58.832 --> 02:05:03.170
but I have decided not to die.

1542
02:05:08.759 --> 02:05:09.885
Oh, Mama.

1543
02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:12.095
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1544
02:05:12.221 --> 02:05:14.139
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1545
02:05:14.264 --> 02:05:15.891
but they wouldn't allow it.

1546
02:05:19.019 --> 02:05:23.607
I have never been more proud of you.

1547
02:05:28.362 --> 02:05:30.113
Thank you.

1548
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:40.123
Mama.

1549
02:06:08.277 --> 02:06:09.903
Need some help with those?

1550
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:13.198
Minny.

1551
02:06:13.323 --> 02:06:15.242
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1552
02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:17.077
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1553
02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:21.081
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1554
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:24.793
You gonna put the stick down?

1555
02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:32.843
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1556
02:06:34.011 --> 02:06:35.262
All of them.

1557
02:06:37.097 --> 02:06:40.851
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1558
02:06:40.976 --> 02:06:42.853
she started getting better.

1559
02:06:43.937 --> 02:06:45.814
So, you saved her life.

1560
02:06:49.193 --> 02:06:52.070
You knew I was here the whole time?

1561
02:06:53.197 --> 02:06:55.324
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1562
02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:59.119
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1563
02:07:01.872 --> 02:07:02.998
No.

1564
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:07.002
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr Johnny.

1565
02:07:07.127 --> 02:07:10.005
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1566
02:07:18.013 --> 02:07:20.307
You just leave that.

1567
02:07:21.016 --> 02:07:22.309
Here you go.

1568
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:24.811
Let's head on up the house.

1569
02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:50.838
What's this?

1570
02:07:51.755 --> 02:07:53.298
I cooked it all by myself.

1571
02:07:53.423 --> 02:07:56.093
Yes, she did. She was up all night.

1572
02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:59.847
I wanted to do something special.

1573
02:08:01.056 --> 02:08:03.183
I wanted to say thank you.

1574
02:08:06.311 --> 02:08:07.312
So...

1575
02:08:08.355 --> 02:08:10.023
...I ain't losing my job?

1576
02:08:12.025 --> 02:08:15.737
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1577
02:08:15.863 --> 02:08:17.030
If you want it.

1578
02:08:23.370 --> 02:08:25.539
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1579
02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.217
- Please.
- Thank you.

1580
02:08:43.265 --> 02:08:44.850
You remember to check the thighs?

1581
02:08:45.976 --> 02:08:48.395
- Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1582
02:08:50.063 --> 02:08:51.899
Just the way you taught me.

1583
02:08:52.065 --> 02:08:53.942
Looky here.

1584
02:08:57.821 --> 02:09:00.824
That table of food gave Minny
the strength she needed.

1585
02:09:01.909 --> 02:09:06.371
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

1586
02:09:11.001 --> 02:09:13.504
What are all these cars doing out here?
Are we late?

1587
02:09:13.837 --> 02:09:15.088
No, we ain't late.

1588
02:09:16.798 --> 02:09:17.925
Why ain't you singing?

1589
02:09:18.091 --> 02:09:20.093
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1590
02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:21.386
Come on now, we late!

1591
02:09:30.354 --> 02:09:33.607
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1592
02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:38.987
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1593
02:09:39.947 --> 02:09:41.073
Come on.

1594
02:09:59.216 --> 02:10:00.551
Come on.

1595
02:10:03.387 --> 02:10:04.847
All right, all right.

1596
02:10:06.348 --> 02:10:11.478
Now... this is an important time
in our community.

1597
02:10:12.312 --> 02:10:16.567
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1598
02:10:19.027 --> 02:10:20.153
Now...

1599
02:10:21.238 --> 02:10:23.949
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1600
02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:27.035
so we all signed our own.

1601
02:10:29.371 --> 02:10:30.455
Thank you.

1602
02:10:34.084 --> 02:10:36.545
Come on, now. Come on.

1603
02:11:14.208 --> 02:11:18.128
Churches over two counties signed
our books. All for you and me.

1604
02:11:22.132 --> 02:11:23.383
It's beautiful.

1605
02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:27.971
What's wrong?

1606
02:11:34.144 --> 02:11:36.396
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1607
02:11:36.563 --> 02:11:39.066
Congratulations!

1608
02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:42.653
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1609
02:11:42.986 --> 02:11:44.488
I can't just leave you two here

1610
02:11:44.613 --> 02:11:47.157
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1611
02:11:49.117 --> 02:11:52.079
If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1612
02:11:52.246 --> 02:11:54.540
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1613
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:58.752
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1614
02:11:59.086 --> 02:12:01.421
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1615
02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:03.131
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1616
02:12:03.257 --> 02:12:06.593
You ain't got nothing left here but
enemies in the Junior League.

1617
02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:08.637
You done burned every bridge there is.

1618
02:12:08.971 --> 02:12:12.724
And you ain't never gonna get another
man in this town. Everybody know that.

1619
02:12:13.767 --> 02:12:17.312
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1620
02:12:19.314 --> 02:12:23.068
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1621
02:12:25.195 --> 02:12:27.030
And she's gonna take care of me.

1622
02:12:38.625 --> 02:12:41.295
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1623
02:12:54.683 --> 02:12:56.810
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1624
02:13:03.317 --> 02:13:04.318
Good morning.

1625
02:13:05.152 --> 02:13:10.032
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1626
02:13:10.157 --> 02:13:12.242
It not polished good?

1627
02:13:12.367 --> 02:13:15.579
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1628
02:13:15.704 --> 02:13:20.459
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1629
02:13:21.710 --> 02:13:24.463
A fork and two spoons.

1630
02:13:25.255 --> 02:13:28.675
Let me go check in the kitchen.
Maybe I left some behind.

1631
02:13:28.842 --> 02:13:32.054
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1632
02:13:34.348 --> 02:13:36.517
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1633
02:13:37.643 --> 02:13:39.686
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1634
02:13:39.853 --> 02:13:41.647
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1635
02:13:42.689 --> 02:13:44.525
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1636
02:13:46.652 --> 02:13:48.362
I ain't got no silver.

1637
02:13:48.529 --> 02:13:50.572
She says she doesn't have them.

1638
02:13:51.198 --> 02:13:55.369
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are fired, Aibileen.

1639
02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:58.622
And I'll be calling the police.

1640
02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:03.377
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1641
02:14:05.546 --> 02:14:08.298
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1642
02:14:08.882 --> 02:14:11.468
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1643
02:14:14.805 --> 02:14:17.683
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1644
02:14:17.808 --> 02:14:19.351
I'm OK.

1645
02:14:29.653 --> 02:14:31.697
I didn't steal no silver.

1646
02:14:31.822 --> 02:14:35.576
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1647
02:14:35.742 --> 02:14:37.619
but I can send you for being a thief.

1648
02:14:37.744 --> 02:14:40.289
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1649
02:14:40.873 --> 02:14:44.168
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1650
02:14:44.293 --> 02:14:47.838
Plenty of time to write the truth about
you. And the paper is free.

1651
02:14:48.172 --> 02:14:51.216
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1652
02:14:51.341 --> 02:14:54.595
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1653
02:14:59.391 --> 02:15:01.518
Call the police, Elizabeth.

1654
02:15:02.311 --> 02:15:04.897
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1655
02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.231
Aibileen, stop!

1656
02:15:06.356 --> 02:15:08.400
You a godless woman.

1657
02:15:10.444 --> 02:15:12.487
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1658
02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.491
Ain't you tired?

1659
02:15:29.838 --> 02:15:32.382
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1660
02:15:46.897 --> 02:15:49.441
Don't go, Aibee.

1661
02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:52.861
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1662
02:15:53.487 --> 02:15:57.533
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1663
02:15:57.658 --> 02:16:00.494
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1664
02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:02.579
No, that's not the reason.

1665
02:16:02.704 --> 02:16:06.333
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1666
02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:08.669
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1667
02:16:08.836 --> 02:16:10.838
Baby. Baby.

1668
02:16:11.839 --> 02:16:14.424
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1669
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:16.677
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1670
02:16:16.802 --> 02:16:22.349
You is kind. You is smart.

1671
02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:24.017
You is important.

1672
02:16:24.351 --> 02:16:26.228
That's right, Baby Girl.

1673
02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:32.776
Don't go, Aibee.

1674
02:16:32.901 --> 02:16:34.278
I gots to, baby.

1675
02:16:36.822 --> 02:16:38.740
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1676
02:16:55.007 --> 02:16:57.384
Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1677
02:16:59.761 --> 02:17:02.681
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1678
02:17:02.806 --> 02:17:05.558
Aibee!

1679
02:17:08.770 --> 02:17:10.939
God says we need to love our enemies.

1680
02:17:11.272 --> 02:17:12.566
No!

1681
02:17:14.484 --> 02:17:15.736
It hard to do.

1682
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:24.076
But it can start by telling the truth.

1683
02:17:29.415 --> 02:17:32.878
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1684
02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:38.424
Once I told the truth about that...

1685
02:17:40.427 --> 02:17:41.929
...I felt free.

1686
02:17:50.478 --> 02:17:53.565
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1687
02:17:55.609 --> 02:17:57.611
And the things I seen and done.

1688
02:18:03.407 --> 02:18:07.663
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1689
02:18:10.958 --> 02:18:13.043
I guess it's gonna be me.
