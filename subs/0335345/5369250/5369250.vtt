1
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:29.241
My Father...

2
00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:35.702
if this chalice...

3
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.790
cannot get past me
without me drinking it...

4
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.620
thy will be done...

5
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.750
So be it...

6
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:57.851
So be it...

7
00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:22.867
Peter...

8
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.247
You could not watch
even one hour with me?

9
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.430
Master, what has happened to you?

10
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.244
Should I call the others, Lord?

11
00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.821
No, John.

12
00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.419
I don't want them
to see me like this.

13
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.889
Are you in danger?
Should we flee, Master?

14
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.538
Stay here.

15
00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.030
Watch.

16
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:47.759
Pray.

17
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.377
What is wrong with him?

18
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.200
He seems afraid.

19
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.747
He had spoken about danger
while we ate...

20
00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:15.126
He mentioned betrayal and...

21
00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:37.483
Thirty.

22
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.959
Thirty, Judas.

23
00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.039
That was the agreement

24
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.790
between me... and you?

25
00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:47.467
- Yes.
- Deliver it.

26
00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.119
Let's go.

27
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.555
Where?

28
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:35.672
Where is he?

29
00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:13.604
Hear me, Father.

30
00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:17.535
Rise up...

31
00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:21.087
Defend me.

32
00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:30.727
Save me from the traps
they set for me...

33
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.654
Do you really believe...

34
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.309
that one man can bear...

35
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.992
the full burden of sin?

36
00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:05.061
Shelter me, O Lord.

37
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.729
I trust in You.

38
00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.238
In You...

39
00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.504
I take refuge.

40
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.840
No one man...

41
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.839
can carry this burden...

42
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.914
I tell you.

43
00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:29.688
It is far too heavy.

44
00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:34.529
Saving their souls is too costly.

45
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:36.704
Never.

46
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.963
No one.

47
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.095
No.

48
00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:43.861
Never.

49
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.374
Father...

50
00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:50.874
You can do all things.

51
00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:54.945
If it is possible...

52
00:06:55.846 --> 00:06:58.438
let this chalice pass from me...

53
00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:03.549
But let Your will be done...

54
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:09.027
not mine.

55
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.882
Who is your father?

56
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.605
<i>Who are you?</i>

57
00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:23.085
Let's go.

58
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.304
Who are you looking for?

59
00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.859
We're looking
for Jesus of Nazareth.

60
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.320
I am he.

61
00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:31.524
Hail, Rabbi!

62
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.010
Judas...

63
00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:49.281
you betray the Son of Man...

64
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.468
with a kiss?

65
00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:20.969
Get them!

66
00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:53.339
Peter!

67
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:56.833
Put it down!

68
00:12:57.704 --> 00:13:00.054
Those who live by the sword...

69
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.575
shall die by the sword!

70
00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.489
Put it down.

71
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.123
Malchus! Malchus!

72
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.398
Get up!
We've got him.

73
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.840
Let's go!

74
00:14:04.884 --> 00:14:06.384
Take the Galilean!

75
00:14:06.385 --> 00:14:07.884
Let's go!

76
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.520
What, Mary?
What is it?

77
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.460
Listen...

78
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.186
"Why is this night different

79
00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:28.990
from every other night?"

80
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:36.038
"Because once we were slaves...

81
00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:39.037
and we are slaves no longer."

82
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.080
They've seized him!

83
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:25.091
Everyone you can, hear?
To the courtyard of the High Priest.

84
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.583
- Quick! Go!
- Yes, yes!

85
00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.093
<i>Halt! Not so fast.</i>

86
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.571
This is not your party,
you toothless vermin.

87
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.590
Peter...

88
00:18:14.123 --> 00:18:15.423
Mary!

89
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.150
Peter!

90
00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:25.011
Hey! What's this?

91
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.883
What's going on here?

92
00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:29.069
In there! Stop them!

93
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.099
They've arrested him!

94
00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:34.341
In secret! In the night!

95
00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.945
To hide their crime from you!

96
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.509
Stop them!

97
00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.252
What are you yelling about,
woman?

98
00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:42.950
Who have they arrested?

99
00:18:44.024 --> 00:18:45.418
Jesus.

100
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.190
Jesus of Nazareth!

101
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.890
- Shut up!
- Jesus!

102
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.640
In there!

103
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.441
Shut up! Enough!

104
00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.262
She's crazy.

105
00:18:57.771 --> 00:19:01.045
A criminal.
Brought in for questioning.

106
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.100
That's all.

107
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.310
Broke the temple laws.

108
00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.855
I see.

109
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:22.359
Better go tell him
there's more trouble brewing.

110
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.687
Tell who?

111
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.618
Abenader, you idiot.

112
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.731
Get going.

113
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.803
Go!

114
00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.308
Jesus...

115
00:20:19.112 --> 00:20:20.812
Jesus!

116
00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.999
Are you hungry?

117
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.037
l am.

118
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.992
This is certainly...

119
00:20:49.293 --> 00:20:51.717
- a tall table!
- Yes.

120
00:20:51.818 --> 00:20:53.118
Who is it for?

121
00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:54.816
A rich man.

122
00:20:57.223 --> 00:20:59.943
Does he like to eat
standing up...

123
00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:01.350
I guess?

124
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.930
No.
He prefers to eat like this.

125
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.210
Tall table, tall chairs!

126
00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:12.598
Well, I haven't made them yet.

127
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.389
This will never catch on!

128
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.058
No, no!

129
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.007
Take off that dirty apron
before you come in.

130
00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:42.926
And wash your hands.

131
00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:12.445
lt has begun, Lord.

132
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:17.931
So be it.

133
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:50.602
<i>Sir, there's trouble at...</i>

134
00:22:50.603 --> 00:22:52.753
What, in the middle of the night,
Abenader?

135
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.526
I'm sorry.

136
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:55.874
What's the problem?

137
00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:58.203
Trouble within the walls.

138
00:22:58.231 --> 00:23:01.831
Caiaphas had a certain prophet
put into custody.

139
00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:03.132
Who?

140
00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:05.310
Some Galilean.

141
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.294
The Pharisees apparently
hate the man.

142
00:23:08.295 --> 00:23:09.645
A Galilean?

143
00:23:10.099 --> 00:23:12.051
Who are you talking about?

144
00:23:12.458 --> 00:23:15.222
Who is this beggar
you bring to us...

145
00:23:16.129 --> 00:23:19.530
chained up like a condemned man?

146
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.878
He's Jesus...

147
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.529
the Nazarene troublemaker.

148
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200
You're Jesus of Nazareth?

149
00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:31.540
They say you're a king.

150
00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:33.947
Where is this kingdom of yours?

151
00:23:34.247 --> 00:23:37.182
What line of kings
do you descend from?

152
00:23:37.489 --> 00:23:38.960
Speak up!

153
00:23:40.353 --> 00:23:44.061
You're just the son
of some obscure carpenter, no?

154
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.918
Some say you're Elijah.

155
00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.824
But he was carried off to heaven
in a chariot!

156
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.902
Why don't you say something?

157
00:23:56.469 --> 00:24:01.597
You've been brought here
as a blasphemer!

158
00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:04.637
What do you say to that?

159
00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:06.909
Defend yourself.

160
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.482
I have spoken openly
to everyone.

161
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.285
I've taught...

162
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.331
in the temple...

163
00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:23.110
where we all gather.

164
00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:26.627
Ask those who have heard
what I have to say.

165
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.518
Is that how you address
the high priest?

166
00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:33.084
With arrogance?

167
00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:49.318
lf I have spoken evil...

168
00:24:49.756 --> 00:24:52.422
tell me what evil I have said.

169
00:24:53.593 --> 00:24:55.060
But if not...

170
00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.781
why do you hit me?

171
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.661
We'll listen to those
who heard your blasphemies.

172
00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:05.336
Good!

173
00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:09.672
Let's hear them.

174
00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:12.378
He cures the sick by magic!

175
00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:13.946
By magic!

176
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.630
With the help of devils!

177
00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:19.610
I've seen it.

178
00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:22.788
He casts out devils...

179
00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:25.989
with the help of devils!

180
00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:29.995
Listen!

181
00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:34.160
He calls himself
the King of the Jews!

182
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:35.861
The King of the Jews!

183
00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:40.262
No, he calls himself
the Son of God!

184
00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:44.067
He said
he would destroy the temple...

185
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.540
and rebuild it in three days!

186
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:52.049
Worse!

187
00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:55.418
He claims he's the Bread of Life!

188
00:25:55.621 --> 00:26:00.604
And if we don't eat his flesh
or drink his blood...

189
00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:03.486
we won't inherit eternal life!

190
00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:06.192
Silence!

191
00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:10.760
You're all under this man's spell.

192
00:26:11.404 --> 00:26:15.036
Either offer proof
of his wrongdoing...

193
00:26:15.037 --> 00:26:18.037
or then...

194
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.097
be quiet!

195
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:25.043
This entire proceeding
is an outrage.

196
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:30.287
All I've heard from these witnesses
is mindless contradiction!

197
00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:43.762
Who called this meeting anyway?

198
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.267
And at this hour of the night?

199
00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:50.601
Where are the other members
of the council?

200
00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:52.096
Get him out of here!

201
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.294
<i>Get out!</i>

202
00:26:57.083 --> 00:27:00.014
This is a travesty!
A beastly travesty!

203
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.960
Order!

204
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:11.295
Haven't you anything to say?

205
00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:13.763
No answer?

206
00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:20.829
I ask you now...

207
00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:23.732
Jesus of Nazareth...

208
00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:29.476
tell us,
are you the Messiah?

209
00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:32.233
The son...

210
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.790
of the living God?

211
00:27:46.132 --> 00:27:48.029
I Am...

212
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.595
and you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of power...

213
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.200
and coming
on the clouds of heaven.

214
00:28:01.102 --> 00:28:02.923
Blasphemy!

215
00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:07.686
You heard him!

216
00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:12.013
There's no need for witnesses!

217
00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:14.774
Your verdict!

218
00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:17.684
What is your verdict?

219
00:28:18.165 --> 00:28:20.484
<i>Death!</i>

220
00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:51.813
Attention!

221
00:28:52.286 --> 00:28:54.136
You can take him!

222
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.585
Haven't I seen you
in the company of the Galilean?

223
00:29:17.957 --> 00:29:20.557
Yes!
You're one of his disciples!

224
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.751
- I recognize you!
- No!

225
00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:24.662
Quiet!

226
00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:26.464
I don't know the man.

227
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.466
You are Peter!
One of the disciples of Jesus.

228
00:29:32.006 --> 00:29:34.006
A disciple of Jesus!

229
00:29:34.907 --> 00:29:36.895
I don't know the man!

230
00:29:37.209 --> 00:29:38.614
You are wrong!

231
00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:40.404
Stop!

232
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.137
I've seen you before!

233
00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:45.112
Stop him! He's one of them!

234
00:29:46.586 --> 00:29:49.714
You're wrong, damn you!

235
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:53.390
I swear I don't know the man.

236
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.699
I've never seen him before!

237
00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:08.372
<i>Wherever you go, Lord...</i>

238
00:30:08.874 --> 00:30:12.771
I will follow, closely.

239
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.099
To prison...

240
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.507
even to death.

241
00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:26.024
Amen, I say to you...

242
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.550
before the cock crows...

243
00:30:34.233 --> 00:30:37.068
three times you will deny me.

244
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.791
Peter?

245
00:31:18.344 --> 00:31:19.993
No, no...

246
00:31:20.194 --> 00:31:21.522
I am unworthy!

247
00:31:22.281 --> 00:31:25.773
I have denied him, Mother!

248
00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:28.965
Denied him...

249
00:31:29.566 --> 00:31:31.244
three times!

250
00:31:42.668 --> 00:31:44.736
Let's go! You take care of it.

251
00:31:44.737 --> 00:31:46.737
In there!

252
00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:53.773
Let him pass.
He's harmless.

253
00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:57.278
Release him!

254
00:31:59.018 --> 00:32:00.918
Take back the silver.

255
00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:02.886
Here!

256
00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:06.690
I've sinned...

257
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.852
betrayed innocent blood.

258
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.388
Take back your silver!
Take it!

259
00:32:14.949 --> 00:32:16.349
I don't want it!

260
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:21.733
If you think you've betrayed
innocent blood, that's your affair.

261
00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:24.609
Take your money and go.

262
00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:27.745
Now go!

263
00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.076
Let him go! Let him go!

264
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.435
What's wrong? Are you all right?

265
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.344
Look at his mouth.
Hey, can we look at it?

266
00:32:59.345 --> 00:33:01.841
You need help? Can we help?

267
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.481
He's bleeding! Look! Blood!

268
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.430
What's wrong with you?

269
00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.447
Leave me alone...

270
00:33:08.848 --> 00:33:10.556
you little...

271
00:33:10.957 --> 00:33:12.417
satans!

272
00:33:13.759 --> 00:33:17.024
It's a cursing!
Are you cursed?

273
00:33:17.096 --> 00:33:18.757
He's cursed!

274
00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:20.998
Yes, the curse is inside him,
look!

275
00:33:32.879 --> 00:33:36.439
Watch out, it's like burning oil
from his bones!

276
00:33:41.387 --> 00:33:42.926
Get away from me!

277
00:33:43.427 --> 00:33:45.187
Leave me alone!

278
00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:06.932
Don't condemn this Galilean.

279
00:38:07.252 --> 00:38:09.042
He's holy.

280
00:38:09.288 --> 00:38:11.849
You will only bring trouble
on yourself.

281
00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.982
Do you want to know
my idea of trouble, Claudia?

282
00:38:15.194 --> 00:38:19.326
This stinking outpost,
that filthy rabble out there.

283
00:39:03.275 --> 00:39:06.442
Do you always punish your prisoners
before they're judged?

284
00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:10.139
- Governor...
- What accusations does this man have?

285
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.512
Well...

286
00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:18.288
if he weren't a malefactor, we wouldn't
have brought him before you.

287
00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:20.322
That's not what I asked.

288
00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:23.024
Why don't you judge him
according to your own laws?

289
00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:25.734
Consul, you know that for us...

290
00:39:26.035 --> 00:39:27.392
it's unlawful...

291
00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:31.103
to condemn any man to death.

292
00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:32.999
To death?

293
00:39:33.138 --> 00:39:36.637
What has this man done
to merit such a penalty?

294
00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:38.920
He has violated our Sabbath,
Consul.

295
00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:43.975
- Go on.
- He has seduced the people...

296
00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:47.619
taught foul and disgusting...

297
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.952
doctrines!

298
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:53.854
Isn't he the prophet you welcomed
into Jerusalem only five days ago?

299
00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:56.021
And now you want him dead?

300
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.661
Can any of you explain
this madness to me?

301
00:40:06.272 --> 00:40:07.972
Your Excellency...

302
00:40:08.409 --> 00:40:10.199
Your Excellency, please...

303
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.526
So far...

304
00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:17.423
the high priest hasn't told you
this man's greatest crime.

305
00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:21.711
He has become the leader
of a large and dangerous sect...

306
00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:24.634
who hail him
as the Son of David!

307
00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:28.056
He also claims, Governor...

308
00:40:28.157 --> 00:40:30.387
that he is the Messiah,

309
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.528
the king promised to the Jews.

310
00:40:33.899 --> 00:40:37.283
He has forbidden his followers
to pay tribute

311
00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:39.859
to the emperor, Consul!

312
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.107
Bring him here!

313
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:21.876
Go!

314
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.330
Drink.

315
00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:44.002
Are you the king of the Jews?

316
00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:49.533
Does this question come from you?

317
00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:55.401
Or do you ask me this because others
have told you that is what I am?

318
00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:00.274
Why would I ask you that?

319
00:42:00.552 --> 00:42:02.242
Am I a Jew?

320
00:42:02.788 --> 00:42:06.346
Your own people,
your high priests...

321
00:42:06.347 --> 00:42:08.348
delivered you up to me.

322
00:42:08.427 --> 00:42:10.388
They want me
to have you executed.

323
00:42:10.562 --> 00:42:12.923
Why? What have you done?

324
00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:17.727
Are you a king?

325
00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:24.564
My kingdom is not of this world.

326
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.497
If it were...

327
00:42:26.645 --> 00:42:31.846
do you think my followers
would have let them hand me over?

328
00:42:31.847 --> 00:42:34.546
Then, you are a king?

329
00:42:36.955 --> 00:42:39.549
That is why I was born.

330
00:42:40.459 --> 00:42:43.357
To give testimony to the truth.

331
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.206
All men who hear the truth...

332
00:42:47.836 --> 00:42:50.089
hear my voice.

333
00:42:50.869 --> 00:42:52.536
Truth!

334
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.845
What is truth?

335
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:29.029
I have questioned this prisoner,
and I find no cause in him.

336
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.610
Wait, wait...

337
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.851
This man is a Galilean,
is he not?

338
00:43:42.821 --> 00:43:44.210
Yes, he is.

339
00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:47.486
Then he is King Herod's subject.

340
00:43:47.526 --> 00:43:49.418
Let Herod judge him.

341
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:51.753
- Governor...
- Hand him over.

342
00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:17.048
Jesus of Nazareth!

343
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:18.956
Where?

344
00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:25.357
Where is he?

345
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.784
This...

346
00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:37.263
is Jesus of Nazareth?

347
00:44:37.464 --> 00:44:39.264
Yes. I must warn you...

348
00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:46.282
Is it true that you restore sight
to the blind?

349
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.970
Raise men from the dead?

350
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.304
Where do you...

351
00:45:10.892 --> 00:45:12.892
get your power?

352
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.960
Are you the one
whose birth was foretold?

353
00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:32.526
Answer me!

354
00:45:33.498 --> 00:45:35.331
Are you a king?

355
00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:42.132
How about me?

356
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:46.571
Will you work a little miracle
for me?

357
00:46:02.827 --> 00:46:05.556
Take this stupid fool
out of my sight!

358
00:46:06.965 --> 00:46:10.191
He's not guilty of a crime,
he's just crazy!

359
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.335
Give him a fool's homage...

360
00:46:37.729 --> 00:46:39.890
What is truth, Claudia?

361
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:41.859
Do you hear it?

362
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:45.198
Recognize it when it is spoken?

363
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.165
Yes, I do.

364
00:46:50.175 --> 00:46:51.577
Don't you?

365
00:46:51.578 --> 00:46:53.105
How?

366
00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:56.013
Can you tell me?

367
00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:10.491
If you will not hear the truth,
no one can tell you.

368
00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:13.559
Truth...

369
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.231
Do you want to know
what my truth is, Claudia?

370
00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:24.308
I've been putting down rebellions
in this rotten outpost for 11 years.

371
00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:27.278
If I don't condemn this man...

372
00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:31.545
I know Caiphas will start a rebellion.

373
00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.778
If I do condemn him...

374
00:47:34.229 --> 00:47:36.486
then his followers may.

375
00:47:36.488 --> 00:47:38.885
Either way,
there will be bloodshed.

376
00:47:38.923 --> 00:47:42.722
Caesar has warned me, Claudia.
Warned me twice.

377
00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.363
He swore that the next time
the blood would be mine.

378
00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:49.426
That is my truth!

379
00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:57.453
Herod refuses
to condemn the man.

380
00:47:57.654 --> 00:47:59.599
They're bringing him back here.

381
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.335
We're going to need
reinforcements.

382
00:48:02.614 --> 00:48:04.814
I don't want to cause
an uprising.

383
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.599
There is already an uprising.

384
00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:38.124
King Herod found no cause
in this man.

385
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:43.064
And I...
I didn't find any either.

386
00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:52.756
An unit!
Another unit here!

387
00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:03.808
Quiet!

388
00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:06.509
Quiet!

389
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.627
Have you no respect
for our Roman procurator?

390
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.621
As you know,

391
00:49:19.782 --> 00:49:22.402
every year I release a criminal
back to you.

392
00:49:22.927 --> 00:49:26.290
We are now holding
a notorious murderer...

393
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.433
called Barabbas.

394
00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:48.680
Which of the two men
would you have me release to you?

395
00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:50.887
The murderer Barabbas?

396
00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.420
Or Jesus, called the Messiah?

397
00:49:53.658 --> 00:49:56.057
He is not the Messiah!

398
00:49:56.058 --> 00:49:58.256
He is an imposter!
A blasphemer!

399
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.061
Free Barabbas!

400
00:50:01.962 --> 00:50:03.742
<i>Free Barabbas!</i>

401
00:50:17.282 --> 00:50:19.726
Again I ask you:

402
00:50:20.027 --> 00:50:22.842
Which of these two men
should I release to you?

403
00:50:22.921 --> 00:50:25.289
<i>Free Barabbas!</i>

404
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.490
Free Barabbas!

405
00:50:41.172 --> 00:50:42.840
Free him.

406
00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:20.677
What would you have me do
with Jesus the Nazarene?

407
00:51:21.402 --> 00:51:23.493
Have him crucified!

408
00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:33.414
Have him crucified!

409
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.284
No!

410
00:51:40.531 --> 00:51:42.318
I will chastise him...

411
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.590
but then I will set him free.

412
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.004
See to it that the punishment
is severe, Abenader.

413
00:51:52.377 --> 00:51:55.640
But don't let them kill the man.

414
00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.640
I heard that he works miracles!

415
00:52:26.441 --> 00:52:28.241
He's just a fool!

416
00:52:28.242 --> 00:52:30.642
He's not a fool! He's a king!

417
00:52:30.743 --> 00:52:32.843
They're rolling the words!
Cheers!

418
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.820
Silence, idiots!

419
00:52:35.021 --> 00:52:36.821
The wine is served!

420
00:52:36.922 --> 00:52:38.222
Get out!

421
00:52:48.223 --> 00:52:49.623
Let's go to him!

422
00:52:52.524 --> 00:52:54.624
For you, Caminus!

423
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.300
Meat for the dogs!

424
00:52:57.901 --> 00:53:00.001
I will write a poem
on his back!

425
00:53:00.102 --> 00:53:01.702
<i>Do more, talk less!</i>

426
00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:03.703
I will write with blood!

427
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.760
Why not?

428
00:53:05.761 --> 00:53:07.761
I'm going to make music!

429
00:53:07.762 --> 00:53:09.562
This will be fun!

430
00:53:10.363 --> 00:53:11.918
To work.

431
00:53:17.328 --> 00:53:19.521
My heart is ready, Father.

432
00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:21.897
My heart is ready.

433
00:53:29.898 --> 00:53:31.298
One!

434
00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.060
Two!

435
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:37.161
Three!

436
00:53:39.462 --> 00:53:40.862
Four!

437
00:53:42.563 --> 00:53:44.013
Five!

438
00:53:46.364 --> 00:53:47.664
Six!

439
00:53:47.965 --> 00:53:49.465
Harder!

440
00:53:49.566 --> 00:53:51.066
Seven!

441
00:53:54.267 --> 00:53:55.667
Eight!

442
00:53:56.968 --> 00:53:58.268
Nine!

443
00:54:01.269 --> 00:54:02.969
Ten!

444
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:05.770
Eleven!

445
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:07.571
Harder!

446
00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:11.972
Thirteen!

447
00:54:12.173 --> 00:54:13.873
Fourteen!

448
00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:15.374
Fifteen!

449
00:54:15.475 --> 00:54:16.775
Sixteen!

450
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.010
Eighteen!

451
00:54:20.511 --> 00:54:22.411
Nineteen!

452
00:54:22.612 --> 00:54:24.012
Twenty!

453
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.820
Twenty-one!

454
00:54:29.321 --> 00:54:31.221
Twenty-two!

455
00:54:31.622 --> 00:54:33.302
Twenty-three!

456
00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.400
<i>Twenty-four...</i>

457
00:54:43.001 --> 00:54:44.601
<i>Twenty-five!</i>

458
00:54:47.202 --> 00:54:49.102
<i>Twenty-six!</i>

459
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.010
<i>Twenty-seven!</i>

460
00:54:55.511 --> 00:54:57.281
<i>Twenty-eight!</i>

461
00:54:58.804 --> 00:55:00.704
Twenty-nine!

462
00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.640
Thirty!

463
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.010
Let's go.

464
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:09.811
<i>Thirty-one!</i>

465
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:12.950
Thirty-two!

466
00:55:12.951 --> 00:55:14.251
Enough!

467
00:55:45.279 --> 00:55:46.779
He wants more?

468
00:55:47.253 --> 00:55:49.053
I can not believe!

469
00:55:49.254 --> 00:55:52.154
His resistance is incredible!

470
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.900
Maybe he likes, right?

471
00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:06.401
Change the instrument.

472
00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:09.552
With spikes, is it?

473
00:56:09.553 --> 00:56:11.954
No. The meat hook.

474
00:56:13.255 --> 00:56:15.115
Show how you like it!

475
00:56:16.416 --> 00:56:18.016
Try this one.

476
00:56:18.217 --> 00:56:21.617
This one can do you good.
Try it, try it!

477
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.918
What are you doing?

478
00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:31.919
My writing is overflowing!

479
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.320
Get out!

480
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:22.821
Now, harder!

481
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.855
My son...

482
00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:51.506
when and where...

483
00:57:52.607 --> 00:57:54.493
and how...

484
00:57:56.373 --> 00:58:00.304
will you choose
to be delivered of this?

485
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.570
Sixteen!

486
00:58:06.571 --> 00:58:08.371
Seventeen!

487
00:58:08.872 --> 00:58:10.872
Eighteen!

488
00:58:15.873 --> 00:58:17.873
Nineteen!

489
00:59:18.874 --> 00:59:20.674
Thirty-five!

490
00:59:21.175 --> 00:59:23.075
Thirty-six!

491
00:59:49.875 --> 00:59:51.775
<i>Forty...</i>

492
01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.778
Enough!

493
01:00:53.379 --> 01:00:54.979
Flip him.

494
01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:08.499
Eight!

495
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.000
Nine!

496
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.701
Ten!

497
01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.752
If the world hates you...

498
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.520
remember that it...

499
01:02:27.856 --> 01:02:29.658
has hated me first.

500
01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.285
And also remember...

501
01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:38.320
that no servant
is greater than his master.

502
01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:42.659
If they persecuted me...

503
01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:46.256
they will persecute you.

504
01:02:47.876 --> 01:02:49.669
You must not be afraid.

505
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.496
The Comforter will come...

506
01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:56.518
the Spirit
who reveals the truth...

507
01:02:56.919 --> 01:02:58.437
about God...

508
01:03:01.412 --> 01:03:03.612
and who comes from the Father.

509
01:03:11.422 --> 01:03:12.783
Hey!

510
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.680
Hey!

511
01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.759
Enough!

512
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.861
Your orders were
to punish this man!

513
01:03:22.823 --> 01:03:26.022
Not to scourge him to death!

514
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.097
Take him away.

515
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.029
Get going!

516
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.280
Get him out of here!

517
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.609
Your majesty...

518
01:05:23.034 --> 01:05:24.529
Take care of it.

519
01:05:25.656 --> 01:05:27.455
A beautiful rose bush.

520
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:34.358
Look at him...
King of the worms!

521
01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.826
Hail, wormy king!

522
01:05:38.127 --> 01:05:39.527
Hail!

523
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.095
The color of royalty!

524
01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.970
We're here to pay our respects.

525
01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.544
Esteemed in your royal robe!

526
01:08:06.545 --> 01:08:08.145
Hail!

527
01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:20.030
It will be now.

528
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.726
Behold the man!

529
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.740
Look!

530
01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.660
Crucify him!

531
01:09:02.761 --> 01:09:06.101
Crucify him!

532
01:09:09.815 --> 01:09:11.215
Quiet!

533
01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:14.317
Isn't this enough?

534
01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:15.749
Look at him!

535
01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.748
Crucify him!

536
01:09:31.802 --> 01:09:33.969
Shall I crucify your king?

537
01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:38.405
We have no king but Caesar!

538
01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:42.255
Speak to me.

539
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:46.273
I have the power to crucify you,
or else to set you free.

540
01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:53.889
You have no power over me...

541
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.132
except what is given you...

542
01:09:59.285 --> 01:10:01.061
from above.

543
01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:05.632
Therefore,
it is he who delivered me to you...

544
01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.396
who has the greater...

545
01:10:10.797 --> 01:10:12.305
sin.

546
01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:14.977
If you free him, Governor...

547
01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.312
that will mean...

548
01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:20.315
you are no friend of Caesar's!

549
01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.951
Because of this...

550
01:10:21.952 --> 01:10:24.311
you must crucify him!

551
01:10:43.612 --> 01:10:45.512
Hold them!

552
01:10:45.813 --> 01:10:48.313
- Bring me the water.
- Hold the scum!

553
01:11:55.906 --> 01:11:58.786
It is you who want to crucify him,
not I.

554
01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:00.647
Look you to it.

555
01:12:01.045 --> 01:12:04.043
I am innocent
of this man's blood.

556
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.030
Let his blood be on us
and on our children!

557
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.230
Abenader.

558
01:12:29.498 --> 01:12:31.398
Do as they wish.

559
01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.250
<i>Get away!</i>

560
01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.051
<i>Jews!</i>

561
01:12:38.624 --> 01:12:40.224
<i>Here comes the king!</i>

562
01:12:40.425 --> 01:12:42.525
<i>Come on, leaders!</i>

563
01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:48.026
Away from the walls!

564
01:12:49.927 --> 01:12:51.627
Rabble!

565
01:13:00.328 --> 01:13:01.628
These Jews!

566
01:13:05.568 --> 01:13:07.495
I am your servant, Father.

567
01:13:07.703 --> 01:13:10.331
Your servant,
and the son of Your handmaid.

568
01:13:11.274 --> 01:13:15.634
Why do you embrace
your cross, fool?

569
01:13:19.015 --> 01:13:20.415
Get up!

570
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.444
All right, your highness!
Let's move!

571
01:13:35.345 --> 01:13:37.645
I heard he did miracles!

572
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:00.818
Help me get near him.

573
01:15:03.819 --> 01:15:06.277
This way. Follow me.

574
01:15:06.518 --> 01:15:08.018
Follow me...

575
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.160
Get up!

576
01:15:55.738 --> 01:15:58.270
This way, Mother.

577
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.620
The king of the Jews!

578
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.671
We have to divide them!

579
01:16:34.408 --> 01:16:35.908
This way!

580
01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:38.667
Mother...

581
01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:04.421
<i>This way!</i>

582
01:17:39.842 --> 01:17:41.275
Mother...

583
01:18:17.646 --> 01:18:19.646
I'm here...

584
01:18:22.852 --> 01:18:24.820
I'm here...

585
01:18:34.096 --> 01:18:35.396
Son...

586
01:18:35.397 --> 01:18:36.904
See, Mother...

587
01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:39.557
I make all things new!

588
01:19:08.398 --> 01:19:09.898
Let's go!

589
01:19:10.399 --> 01:19:11.699
Who is that?

590
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.000
Who?

591
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.600
She's the Galilean's mother.

592
01:19:16.939 --> 01:19:18.239
Let's go.

593
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:22.009
Hurry!

594
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.210
Faster!

595
01:20:32.381 --> 01:20:34.440
Don't fret, my daughter.

596
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.745
Don't fret.

597
01:20:46.748 --> 01:20:48.098
Jew!

598
01:20:53.699 --> 01:20:55.399
This way! This way!

599
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:04.650
You! You!

600
01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:07.151
You!

601
01:21:07.512 --> 01:21:09.177
Are you blind?

602
01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:13.717
Can't you see, he can't go on?

603
01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.860
Help him!

604
01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:35.261
Dad, dad...

605
01:21:38.113 --> 01:21:39.433
You!

606
01:21:39.948 --> 01:21:42.721
Yes, you there!

607
01:21:43.622 --> 01:21:44.922
Get over here!

608
01:21:50.959 --> 01:21:52.460
What do you want from me?

609
01:21:52.461 --> 01:21:55.724
This criminal can't carry his cross
by himself anymore.

610
01:21:55.798 --> 01:21:58.128
You will help him! Get going!

611
01:21:59.501 --> 01:22:02.416
I can't do that.
It's none of my business.

612
01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.796
Get someone else!

613
01:22:03.806 --> 01:22:06.366
Help him! He is a holy man!

614
01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:09.172
Do as I tell you. Now move!
Let's go!

615
01:22:13.181 --> 01:22:15.581
All right, but remember...

616
01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:17.428
I'm an innocent man...

617
01:22:17.529 --> 01:22:19.782
forced to carry the cross
of a condemned man.

618
01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.648
Stay here. Wait for me.

619
01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:35.149
Let's go!

620
01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.080
Don't stop!

621
01:24:19.474 --> 01:24:22.352
Permit me, my Lord.

622
01:24:48.806 --> 01:24:50.306
What are you doing?

623
01:24:51.907 --> 01:24:54.232
Who do you think you are?

624
01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:58.788
Go.
Get away from here.

625
01:24:59.899 --> 01:25:01.823
Impossible people!

626
01:25:09.892 --> 01:25:13.092
Someone stop this!

627
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:17.730
Restrain yourself!

628
01:25:28.602 --> 01:25:31.297
Stop!

629
01:25:31.939 --> 01:25:35.239
Stop! Stop!

630
01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.040
Stop!

631
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:42.130
Leave him alone!

632
01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.420
Leave him alone now!

633
01:25:49.831 --> 01:25:52.164
If you don't stop...

634
01:25:52.865 --> 01:25:55.034
I won't carry that
cross one more step.

635
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:58.780
I don't care what you do to me!

636
01:26:03.378 --> 01:26:06.547
All right, all right.
Let's get moving!

637
01:26:06.982 --> 01:26:08.963
We don't have all day.

638
01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:10.506
Let's go!

639
01:26:11.507 --> 01:26:12.807
Hurry!

640
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:17.491
Let's go!

641
01:26:18.611 --> 01:26:20.208
Jew!

642
01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:28.821
Let's go, let's go!

643
01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:32.609
Get up!

644
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:38.210
Tough Jew!

645
01:26:40.711 --> 01:26:42.971
Come on, king of worms!
Let's go!

646
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:46.608
King of the dead!

647
01:26:49.009 --> 01:26:50.309
Let's go!

648
01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:52.110
Go!

649
01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.480
Hurry!

650
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:46.750
Open the gates!

651
01:28:51.852 --> 01:28:54.082
<i>Up! Raise!</i>

652
01:28:58.353 --> 01:29:00.245
Almost there.

653
01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.760
Let's go...

654
01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.845
Let's go!

655
01:29:22.811 --> 01:29:24.711
Almost done...

656
01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.080
Almost done.

657
01:29:35.557 --> 01:29:37.987
You have heard...

658
01:29:38.788 --> 01:29:40.488
this saying...

659
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:45.173
"Love your neighbor
and hate your enemy."

660
01:29:46.168 --> 01:29:48.629
But I say to you:

661
01:29:49.638 --> 01:29:52.086
love your enemies...

662
01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:55.598
and pray for those
who persecute you...

663
01:29:57.179 --> 01:30:00.510
For if you only love
those who love you...

664
01:30:04.286 --> 01:30:06.286
what reward is there in that?

665
01:30:19.787 --> 01:30:21.487
Go away!

666
01:30:40.999 --> 01:30:42.399
Forward!

667
01:31:03.645 --> 01:31:06.177
I am the good shepherd.

668
01:31:07.082 --> 01:31:09.707
I lay down my life
for my sheep.

669
01:31:10.252 --> 01:31:13.478
No one takes my life from me...

670
01:31:14.156 --> 01:31:16.524
but I lay it down
of my own accord.

671
01:31:16.691 --> 01:31:18.818
I have power to lay it down...

672
01:31:19.194 --> 01:31:21.206
and power to take it up...

673
01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.153
again.

674
01:31:25.367 --> 01:31:27.267
This command is from my Father.

675
01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:56.141
You are going to need help
here!

676
01:32:07.942 --> 01:32:10.236
Leave. Go on!

677
01:32:10.437 --> 01:32:13.037
Go on! Go on!

678
01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.717
You can get up now!

679
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:24.930
Get up!

680
01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.740
Enough!

681
01:33:03.264 --> 01:33:06.461
Stand up!
Get up, your majesty.

682
01:33:07.068 --> 01:33:09.729
Can't you get up?

683
01:33:10.639 --> 01:33:12.901
We haven't got all day!

684
01:33:22.317 --> 01:33:23.841
Move! We're ready.

685
01:33:23.852 --> 01:33:25.783
Get up, your highness.

686
01:33:35.621 --> 01:33:39.621
What happened?
We are waiting for you!

687
01:33:39.622 --> 01:33:41.122
Get up!

688
01:33:57.523 --> 01:33:59.423
<i>Tough...</i>

689
01:34:00.324 --> 01:34:02.324
<i>Jew!</i>

690
01:34:34.225 --> 01:34:36.625
So far, you're doing fine!

691
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:43.898
Hurry!

692
01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.320
Faster!

693
01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:54.421
Let's go!

694
01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.101
- The new king!
<i>- Get up!</i>

695
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:01.420
A sunken hull!

696
01:35:04.421 --> 01:35:07.301
He is obviously stupid!

697
01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.284
You are my friends.

698
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:16.589
There is no greater love
than for a man...

699
01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:19.330
to lay down his life
for his friends.

700
01:35:24.031 --> 01:35:25.531
Faster!

701
01:35:32.878 --> 01:35:36.188
Stupid,
you're going to love this!

702
01:35:48.489 --> 01:35:49.889
Strength!

703
01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:17.653
<i>I cannot be with you much longer,
my friends.</i>

704
01:36:18.295 --> 01:36:19.828
You...

705
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:22.102
cannot...

706
01:36:23.203 --> 01:36:26.267
go where I am going.

707
01:36:26.434 --> 01:36:29.967
My commandment to you
after I am gone, is this:

708
01:36:31.699 --> 01:36:33.826
Love one another.

709
01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:37.160
As I have loved you...

710
01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:39.160
you...

711
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:42.609
must love each other.

712
01:37:04.873 --> 01:37:07.501
You believe in me.

713
01:37:11.312 --> 01:37:14.440
You know that I am the Way...

714
01:37:15.016 --> 01:37:16.816
the Truth...

715
01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:20.176
and the Life.

716
01:37:21.699 --> 01:37:25.527
And no one comes to the Father
but by me.

717
01:37:30.999 --> 01:37:32.856
Further out...

718
01:37:40.208 --> 01:37:43.766
Idiots!
Let me show you how to do it.

719
01:37:44.145 --> 01:37:45.445
Like this!

720
01:38:03.831 --> 01:38:05.529
There! Get in there!

721
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:08.665
Hold the hand open... like this!

722
01:38:08.989 --> 01:38:11.798
Father, forgive them!

723
01:39:01.289 --> 01:39:03.013
Father...

724
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.582
<i>Father, my Father...
my God...</i>

725
01:39:11.299 --> 01:39:14.427
They don't know what they do...

726
01:39:18.339 --> 01:39:20.632
Hey, look, your jackals!

727
01:39:20.808 --> 01:39:25.008
Turn the wood over
on its face, idiots!

728
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:26.899
Lift up the cross!

729
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.160
Bend the nails!

730
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:16.100
<i>Sunken hull!</i>

731
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:30.740
Fix it in place.

732
01:40:47.941 --> 01:40:51.741
JESUS OF NAZARETH
THE KING OF THE JEWS

733
01:40:52.733 --> 01:40:55.823
Take this and eat.

734
01:40:56.103 --> 01:40:58.020
This is my body...

735
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:01.006
which is given up for you.

736
01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:47.428
Take this and drink.

737
01:42:47.903 --> 01:42:49.713
This is my...

738
01:42:50.214 --> 01:42:52.770
blood of the new covenant...

739
01:42:52.902 --> 01:42:56.434
which is given for you and for many,
for the forgiveness of sins.

740
01:42:58.159 --> 01:43:00.359
Do this in memory of me.

741
01:43:29.457 --> 01:43:32.256
If you are the son of God...

742
01:43:33.634 --> 01:43:36.112
why don't you save yourself?

743
01:43:36.564 --> 01:43:39.432
Prove it to all of us...

744
01:43:40.678 --> 01:43:43.967
that you are
who you say you are!

745
01:43:56.068 --> 01:43:57.577
Come down!

746
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:05.411
You said you could
destroy the temple...

747
01:44:05.489 --> 01:44:08.398
and rebuild it in three days...

748
01:44:08.729 --> 01:44:12.331
and yet you cannot come down
from that cross.

749
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:16.525
If he is the Messiah...

750
01:44:16.904 --> 01:44:21.303
I say let him come down
from the cross,

751
01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:24.725
so that we may see and believe!

752
01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.830
Jesus!

753
01:44:34.388 --> 01:44:35.888
Father...

754
01:44:37.447 --> 01:44:38.848
forgive them!

755
01:44:40.061 --> 01:44:42.322
They know not what they do.

756
01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.200
They don't know!

757
01:44:48.969 --> 01:44:50.368
Listen...

758
01:44:52.106 --> 01:44:54.803
He prays for you!

759
01:45:10.391 --> 01:45:13.019
We deserve this, Gesmas...

760
01:45:14.361 --> 01:45:16.152
but he does not!

761
01:45:18.670 --> 01:45:20.169
I have sinned...

762
01:45:21.602 --> 01:45:25.636
and my punishment is just!

763
01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.820
You would be justified
in condemning me...

764
01:45:31.545 --> 01:45:35.122
I ask only
that you remember me...

765
01:45:35.423 --> 01:45:36.748
Lord...

766
01:45:36.817 --> 01:45:40.229
when you enter your kingdom...

767
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:44.887
Amen, I tell you...

768
01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:50.530
on this day you shall be with me...

769
01:45:53.367 --> 01:45:55.294
in paradise.

770
01:49:09.490 --> 01:49:11.437
I thirst...

771
01:49:46.467 --> 01:49:49.035
Flesh of my flesh...

772
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:54.192
heart of my heart...

773
01:49:56.177 --> 01:49:57.849
My son...

774
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:02.347
let me die with you!

775
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.595
Woman...

776
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:09.082
behold...

777
01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:11.557
your son.

778
01:50:15.398 --> 01:50:17.098
John...

779
01:50:18.399 --> 01:50:20.329
Son, behold...

780
01:50:25.906 --> 01:50:28.040
your mother!

781
01:50:38.018 --> 01:50:40.287
There is no one left!

782
01:50:42.256 --> 01:50:43.906
No one...

783
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:47.174
Jesus!

784
01:50:57.371 --> 01:50:59.029
My God...

785
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.300
My God...

786
01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:16.180
why have you forsaken me?

787
01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.624
It is accomplished.

788
01:52:01.135 --> 01:52:02.682
Father...

789
01:52:03.283 --> 01:52:05.264
into Your hands...

790
01:52:06.006 --> 01:52:07.879
I commend...

791
01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.338
my spirit.

792
01:53:16.378 --> 01:53:18.208
Kill them!

793
01:53:18.509 --> 01:53:21.249
What is that?
You're not robbers!

794
01:53:21.370 --> 01:53:23.570
Be quiet! Be quiet!

795
01:53:30.471 --> 01:53:32.671
Make walls of yourselves!

796
01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:34.749
Go!

797
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:40.250
Break the shins!

798
01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:42.100
Kill them!

799
01:53:42.401 --> 01:53:44.491
Quick! Quick!

800
01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:05.289
Cassius! Hurry!

801
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.468
He's dead!

802
01:54:08.729 --> 01:54:10.496
Make sure!
