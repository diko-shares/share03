1
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,503
Stay down!

2
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,281
Don't move!

3
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,484
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,125
Mayday! Mayday! This
is the <i>Sawyer-Two.</i>

5
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,993
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,750
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,536
<i>They say everybody's
good at something.</i>

8
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,705
<i>Me? I talk to fish.</i>

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,610
<i>That's how I met
my friend, Storm.</i>

10
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,045
<i>He's always there
when I need a lift.</i>

11
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,793
<i>Some people think
that makes me a joke.</i>

12
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,595
<i>But I don't care.
You know why?</i>

13
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,467
<i>'Cause I'm also good
at something else.</i>

14
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,335
<i>And that's breaking heads.</i>

15
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,631
Pow! Papa took on
all the pirates.

16
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:53,937
I was like, "Well, the
pirates think that..."

17
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,582
Hi-ya!

18
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,069
Papa kicked their butts.

19
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,834
Those chum lickers
didn't stand a chance.

20
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,158
Ooh!

21
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,160
<i>Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.</i>

22
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,312
Yeah! Come on!

23
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,969
Watch out.

24
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,508
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

25
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,711
<i>Oh, yeah, this is
my son, Arthur Jr.</i>

26
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,481
<i>See, four years ago,
everything changed.</i>

27
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,379
<i>I met a woman, fell in love,
and the next thing I know,</i>

28
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:32,924
<i>we're getting married
and having a kid.</i>

29
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,802
<i>This little guy's the best
thing that ever happened to me.</i>

30
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,095
<i>But this kid, he doesn't sleep.</i>

31
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,232
What you got in there, huh?

32
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,201
Okay...

33
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,936
<i>And he never misses.</i>

34
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,372
What the...

35
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,086
<i>And then, I'm up at
the crack of dawn</i>

36
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,152
<i>because on top of getting
married and having a kid...</i>

37
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,418
<i>I finally got a job.</i>

38
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,584
<i>That's right. I'm the
king of freaking Atlantis.</i>

39
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,755
<i>How did I score that, you asked?</i>

40
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,591
<i>Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,</i>

41
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,359
<i>from attacking
the surface world.</i>

42
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,976
<i>And in doing so, I claimed
the throne from him.</i>

43
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,498
<i>At first I was all like...</i>

44
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,167
Yeah!

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,211
The territorial waters
are long held...

46
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,750
<i>But then, as it turned out,</i>

47
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:26,575
<i>being king wasn't all
it was cracked up to be.</i>

48
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,177
<i>It's just meetings
all day and politics.</i>

49
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,288
<i>I'm so bored, I don't even know
which end of the Brine King</i>

50
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,936
<i>I'm supposed to be
looking at half the time.</i>

51
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,851
Whoo!

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,519
Yeah! That was awesome!

53
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,354
<i>And if that's not bad enough,</i>

54
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,490
<i>turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing</i>

55
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,525
<i>that nobody told me about.</i>

56
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,428
<i>Which basically gets to shoot
down everything I want to do.</i>

57
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,229
<i>The only thing that
makes all the hard work</i>

58
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,933
<i>and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.</i>

59
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,901
Hey! You missed me!

60
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,441
<i>But of course, there are
fun parts of the job.</i>

61
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,278
Whoa!

62
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,312
<i>I get to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.</i>

63
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,905
<i>Especially when I get to take
down an illegal cage fight or two.</i>

64
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,696
<i>But for everything I get right,</i>

65
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,631
<i>something else gets screwed up.</i>

66
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,742
Ah, fu...

67
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,252
<i>♪ Born to be wild ♪</i>

68
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,637
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

69
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,342
<i>Slainte.</i>

70
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,250
So...

71
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,887
he's gonna need a little
brother or sister to play with.

72
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,027
He's got a dog.

73
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,896
Hey, I'm serious.

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,033
I saw how lonely it
was for you growing up.

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,534
An only child.

76
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,439
I always regretted I
couldn't give you that.

77
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,676
Yeah, well, don't be
too hard on yourself.

78
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,311
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dick bag.

79
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,780
Come on.

80
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,951
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

81
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,654
Sure, siblings
bicker and fight...

82
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,290
but at the end of the
day, they're family.

83
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,962
You should be able to
count on them for help.

84
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,565
Yeah, well, I'll still take
the dog over him any day.

85
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,372
Hey, look at that.

86
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,252
Holy crap.

87
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:35,061
Hi, baby boy. Are you
talking to the fishies?

88
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,736
Oh, man. Pops, this
is blowing my mind.

89
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,872
My whole life I've wanted to
share this gift with someone.

90
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,842
Yeah, but you and me,
son, we're different.

91
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,912
We're special.

92
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,414
We're connected to
the land and the sea.

93
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,952
I can't wait to introduce you to all
the majestic creatures on our planet.

94
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,122
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

95
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,490
Yeah, you and me.

96
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,848
I cross-referenced the
coordinates from Dr. Shin.

97
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,717
Nothing.

98
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,952
Still no sign of Atlantean
remnants under the ice.

99
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,387
Looks like he's led us on
another wild goose chase.

100
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,108
Every day I don't
fix my power suit

101
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,944
is another day
Aquaman gets to live.

102
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,117
Check again.

103
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,686
We're close this
time. I can feel it.

104
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,798
Expedition log day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

105
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,502
My quest for Atlantis has brought
me to the ends of the earth.

106
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,471
David Kane is
losing his patience.

107
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,942
If I don't turn up the Atlantean
technology he's looking for soon,

108
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,211
they're probably
going to... um...

109
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,190
You know what, let's
not even go there.

110
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,817
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

111
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,131
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

112
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,701
Please tell me you
found something.

113
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,602
Seismic array is going crazy.

114
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,837
Where's the epicenter?

115
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,806
We're standing on it.

116
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,664
Run!

117
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,281
What just happened?
An earthquake?

118
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,551
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

119
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,757
Come on. Get up.

120
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,028
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

121
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,230
Come on, get up. Go, we
gotta go! We gotta go!

122
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,367
Come on, we gotta
move! Come on!

123
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,258
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

124
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,991
What the hell happened to you?

125
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,428
There's something back there.

126
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,311
Astounding.

127
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,447
My readings show
something's down here.

128
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,450
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

129
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:07,787
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

130
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,823
How is this place even possible?

131
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,134
This was all probably solid ice

132
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,361
until we started
heating the planet.

133
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,765
Well, thank God for global
warming, am I right?

134
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,801
Uh, yeah, that's not
exactly a good thing.

135
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,221
The tracks lead down there.

136
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,924
Suit up.

137
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,861
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

138
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,730
the monster's down there.

139
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,338
Okay. I guess we're
going down there.

140
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,198
I don't believe this.

141
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,936
It's a structure of some kind.

142
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,573
And there's more
buried in the ice.

143
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,975
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

144
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,446
- Everyone, fan out and search.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,348
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

146
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,388
This has to be a few
thousand years old.

147
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,023
Astounding.

148
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,864
Whoa.

149
00:14:58,632 --> 00:14:59,899
Uh...

150
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,475
Ow...

151
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,293
What is this place?

152
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:06,326
<i>At last, you are here.</i>

153
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,165
Free me from my prison

154
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,301
and I will grant
you the strength

155
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,139
<i>to kill the man who
murdered your father.</i>

156
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,940
You can't leave him like this!

157
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,676
You ask the sea for mercy.

158
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,678
Get out of here!
You need to live

159
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,347
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

160
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,452
<i>You will take from him
what he stole from you.</i>

161
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,524
<i>His home will burn</i>

162
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:08,529
<i>and his kingdom will
fall before my legions.</i>

163
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

164
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,671
David. No, David.

165
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,372
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

166
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,675
David. David, it's okay.

167
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,075
You're all right.

168
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,145
What the hell is that thing?

169
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,639
<i>Just unbelievable footage</i>

170
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,565
<i>coming in from all
around the world.</i>

171
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,200
<i>Good evening, folks.</i>

172
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,344
<i>In the past five months, we've seen
an extraordinary rise in temperatures</i>

173
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,572
<i>reported around the world.</i>

174
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,274
<i>And that has resulted in some of
the wildest weather we've ever seen.</i>

175
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,745
<i>Yes, this is thundersnow
in Dallas, Texas.</i>

176
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,590
<i>Visibility is near zero...</i>

177
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,616
<i>and there's more
snow expected tonight</i>

178
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,052
<i>than Dallas usually
sees in an entire year.</i>

179
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,789
<i>It's only one part of a
worldwide weather phenomenon</i>

180
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,425
<i>unlike anything we've
ever seen before.</i>

181
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,432
Arthur.

182
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,505
The Council's called for
an emergency gathering.

183
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:28,107
There's been another
plague outbreak.

184
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,310
<i>Scientists are at
a loss to explain.</i>

185
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,346
<i>But the real question is,</i>

186
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,047
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

187
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,316
<i>And how much hotter
is it going to get?</i>

188
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,623
Where did it hit this time?

189
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,758
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

190
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,593
and there are now
reports of outbreaks

191
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:49,061
in the Fishermen
Kingdom as well.

192
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,698
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

193
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:53,734
Why now?

194
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,169
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

195
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,205
Take your pick.

196
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:04,545
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

197
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,556
You can't expect them to
care about what happens to us

198
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,282
if they don't even
know we exist.

199
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,827
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

200
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,252
we have to take our
seat at the table.

201
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,461
It's time for Atlantis to
reveal itself to the surface.

202
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,635
Your majesty is well aware of
the Council's position on this.

203
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,137
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

204
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,107
and combine our technologies to reverse
the damage that they've already done.

205
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,711
And I know this is
against our traditions,

206
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,446
but the world is shrinking,

207
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,515
and the old ways aren't
gonna protect us anymore.

208
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,183
Times have changed.

209
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,787
Atlantis wants this.

210
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,220
There's a whole
generation out there

211
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,756
that don't want to hide anymore.

212
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,225
Have you already
forgotten that this plague

213
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,228
killed your own beloved mentor,

214
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,666
and you want to
negotiate with them?

215
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,738
We gave your brother war powers and
made him Ocean Master for a reason.

216
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,842
If we ever decide to make ourselves
known to the surface-dwellers,

217
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,813
it will be to eradicate
them, not to co-exist.

218
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,309
Hey, not bad.

219
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,948
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

220
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,816
I don't know how
you did it, Pops.

221
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,952
Mera and I have the
whole kingdom helping us,

222
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,454
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

223
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,890
And you...

224
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,226
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

225
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,533
You're the real superhero.

226
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,672
- To single parents.
- Mmm.

227
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,276
Well, my job was a little
less stressful than yours.

228
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,681
Yeah, well, I just
plain suck at my job.

229
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:24,383
Vulko told me to bring the
land and the sea together.

230
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:28,789
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

231
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,290
They won't listen. I
can't bring shit together.

232
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,393
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

233
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,662
I know.

234
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:39,298
I miss him.

235
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,470
Hey.

236
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,475
You can't save them all, son.

237
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:52,244
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

238
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,550
I just kept going.

239
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,820
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

240
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,489
And you wake up the next
day and you do it again.

241
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,591
Sometimes not giving up

242
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,960
is the most heroic
thing you can do.

243
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,522
Humans were not made to
live at these depths.

244
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:11,825
Yeah, don't worry about that.

245
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,694
You just remember
who built this ship.

246
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,097
I'm more worried about how
long ago they built it.

247
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,835
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

248
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,421
Hey, doc.

249
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,723
You stand ready with
that big gun of yours.

250
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:57,537
Expedition log, day 613.

251
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:00,040
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

252
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:02,876
<i>A three man octobot
infiltration team.</i>

253
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,523
<i>It's incredible that these
ancient machines we found</i>

254
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,783
<i>still function after
all these years.</i>

255
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,018
<i>All I did was retrofit
them to our needs.</i>

256
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:16,156
<i>But they require a very specialized
fuel to keep them running.</i>

257
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,592
<i>Kane calls it orichalcum.</i>

258
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,460
<i>I don't know how he
knows about this,</i>

259
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,029
<i>but it all started the
day he found that trident.</i>

260
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,032
<i>Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know,</i>

261
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,969
<i>including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum</i>

262
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:32,038
<i>is to steal it from
highly-protected storage vaults.</i>

263
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:34,841
<i>And we're about to hit the
most dangerous one of them all.</i>

264
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,490
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

265
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,526
<i>No margin for error.</i>

266
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,809
<i>Yeah, this should
take you through.</i>

267
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,525
<i>We don't want any confrontation.</i>

268
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,961
<i>David, we can't fight
their entire army.</i>

269
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,913
<i>Stay vigilant.</i>

270
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,626
<i>We have no idea what kind of security
measures they have down there.</i>

271
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,744
<i>Commencing extraction.</i>

272
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,113
<i>Be careful. It's
highly volatile.</i>

273
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,589
<i>Loading barge now.</i>

274
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:23,676
Stingray, change of plans.

275
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,278
I need an extraction now!

276
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:29,015
All hands to battle stations.

277
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,683
Astounding.

278
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,657
Attention, unidentified vessel.

279
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,058
You are out of the transit zone.

280
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:14,694
Doctor, power up
the sonic battery.

281
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,831
Illegal border crossing will
be met with deadly force.

282
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:18,864
Now!

283
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,635
Commencing charge.

284
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,811
Border Control,
intruder approaching.

285
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:34,080
Arm hydro cannon
and lock target.

286
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,683
Hydro cannon at front border
gate locking in on target.

287
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,196
Chargers set to maximum power.

288
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,755
Intruder in sight.

289
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,023
Take them out!

290
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,698
What are you
waiting for? Fire!

291
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,798
Sir, Atlantean hostiles
are approaching.

292
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,877
Split up. Make your way
to the extraction point.

293
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,235
Roger.

294
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,870
They've raided
the storage vault.

295
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:32,138
We can't let them get away.

296
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:35,008
Don't worry, they
won't. I'm on this one.

297
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,790
Hold your fire!

298
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,402
They're cutting through
the Night Market.

299
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,360
Watch out for the civilians.

300
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,817
Warning. Warning.

301
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,819
Illegal entrance into hypertube.

302
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,388
Exceeding maximum
speed of 600 knots.

303
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,357
Reduce speed immediately.

304
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,471
Oh, shit.

305
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,623
<i>David, we're here at
the extraction point.</i>

306
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,958
<i>The orichalcum is onboard and
secure. Come on, let's go!</i>

307
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,193
Not yet!

308
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,862
I'm gonna kill me
a dead mermaid.

309
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:23,276
Get away from my wife!

310
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,480
Your wife?

311
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:28,948
First you steal your
brother's throne,

312
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,883
then you steal his woman?

313
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:34,153
Aquaman, shame on you.

314
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,563
Uh, David, we gotta go.

315
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,931
The entire Atlantean
army is headed this way.

316
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,899
If we don't leave
now, we're dead.

317
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,349
Twenty degrees port!

318
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,233
Fire the sonic cannon!

319
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,102
Come on, Shin!

320
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,485
<i>Lady Karshon has called</i>

321
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:14,053
<i>an emergency session
of the High Council</i>

322
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,390
<i>to discuss a motion that would strip
the throne of its executive power.</i>

323
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:21,728
<i>The throne is the
heart of Atlantis.</i>

324
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:24,431
<i>Too often now it stands empty,</i>

325
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:28,167
<i>while our king spends
half his time on land.</i>

326
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:32,673
<i>And now his surface world
enemies have followed him home.</i>

327
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:35,476
<i>This tragedy is merely a taste</i>

328
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:37,778
<i>of the havoc that
will be wrought,</i>

329
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:41,582
<i>if Atlantis ever becomes
known to the surface.</i>

330
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:45,251
<i>Because if he cannot
protect his own family,</i>

331
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:48,387
<i>how is he supposed
to protect us?</i>

332
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:59,165
He's different now. He's
stronger than before.

333
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,200
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

334
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,470
And where the hell did he
get all the new toys from?

335
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:05,071
The technology seems ancient,

336
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,340
but we've never seen
anything like it.

337
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:11,344
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

338
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,179
that disrupts the
nervous system.

339
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,615
Do we know what was stolen?

340
00:35:14,648 --> 00:35:18,719
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

341
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,321
Am I supposed to
know what that is?

342
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:25,592
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

343
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,327
It emits tremendous
amounts of greenhouse gases

344
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:30,196
that are highly
destructive to our planet.

345
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:33,099
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

346
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,669
before we realized
what we were doing.

347
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:39,372
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

348
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:43,075
has been buried in 12 storage
vaults deep underground.

349
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,787
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

350
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,581
He's already been
there. It's all gone.

351
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,550
We think he's been
launching secret raids

352
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,451
for at least five months.

353
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,119
This is just the
time he got caught.

354
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,597
Well, this spike in
global temperatures

355
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:56,623
that's causing
disasters on the surface

356
00:35:56,657 --> 00:36:01,495
and making the sea dwellers
sick happened five months ago.

357
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:04,631
He's using the stolen
orichalcum to heat the planet.

358
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,502
Why would he do that?

359
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:10,704
I don't know, but
I'm gonna find out.

360
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:14,140
If he is using the orichalcum to heat
the planet, we don't have much time.

361
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,242
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

362
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:20,581
He must be stopped or a global
climate meltdown is imminent.

363
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,214
We need to find him,

364
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:23,793
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

365
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,152
I think I know someone who
might be able to help us.

366
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:28,722
But you're not gonna like it.

367
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:32,459
Your brother?

368
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,571
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

369
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,630
but he's dealt with
Manta in the past,

370
00:36:36,663 --> 00:36:38,741
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

371
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:42,536
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

372
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,671
He killed their king.

373
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,239
I wasn't exactly gonna
ask for permission.

374
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:51,612
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

375
00:36:51,645 --> 00:36:53,814
It would be an act of war.

376
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,850
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

377
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,219
I'm gonna break him out myself.

378
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,724
Arthur, Karshon is looking for
a reason to seize war powers.

379
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,526
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

380
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,937
My place is out
there where I belong,

381
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,463
where I'm actually
good at what I do.

382
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,565
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

383
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:13,767
I've got to do this.

384
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:18,939
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

385
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,207
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

386
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,712
Then help me not get caught.

387
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:31,952
<i>Xebelian intelligence
has recently learned</i>

388
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,954
<i>that your brother is
being held on the surface</i>

389
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,556
<i>in a secret one-of-a-kind
underground facility.</i>

390
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,558
<i>They're assuming no sea dweller</i>

391
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,761
<i>would ever dare
cross the desert.</i>

392
00:37:40,794 --> 00:37:42,929
And here's a special
outfit for you.

393
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:46,466
What is that,
boy's extra medium?

394
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,768
It's supposed to be tight.

395
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,436
The chromatophores change color

396
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,880
<i>and camouflage you
for up to a minute,</i>

397
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:53,607
<i>making you undetectable
to most sensors.</i>

398
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,542
<i>They'll never see you coming.</i>

399
00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,321
What are we doing for comms?

400
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:01,347
Open comms are too risky.

401
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,451
I'll be sending a cephalopod
with you to act as a messenger.

402
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,721
That's an octopus.

403
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:10,824
Tactical Operations
and Pursuit Operative.

404
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,826
Topo, for short.

405
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,861
Genetically engineered
intelligence

406
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:17,531
for infiltration and espionage.

407
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:20,399
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

408
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,542
Just try and lay low when
we get in there, okay?

409
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,410
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

410
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:32,579
is starting to smell
like warm chum butter.

411
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:36,450
Aw, Topo, you dumb squid!

412
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,851
God, come on!

413
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,688
Is ink piss?

414
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,458
<i>The prison is guarded by
fearsome Deserter remnants.</i>

415
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,892
<i>Death-worshipping ascetics</i>

416
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:48,360
<i>who survived when
the Sahara went dry</i>

417
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,031
<i>by turning to blood
for sustenance.</i>

418
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:53,365
<i>If they catch you,
they'll bleed you dry.</i>

419
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,837
<i>When you find Orm,
he'll be weak.</i>

420
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,840
<i>They're limiting
his water supply...</i>

421
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:02,274
<i>just enough to keep him alive.</i>

422
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:07,881
And if you do see Orm,

423
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:09,381
you tell him that I love him.

424
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,954
You tell him that I
think of him every day.

425
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:15,856
I will.

426
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,591
Look, I know he's family,

427
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,926
but you can't forget who
you're dealing with here.

428
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,728
Once you've broken Orm out,

429
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:23,473
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

430
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:26,265
<i>You need him, but you
can never trust him.</i>

431
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:30,730
Whoo... You look rough.

432
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,733
What the hell are
<i>you</i> doing here?

433
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:34,868
I'm here to break you out.

434
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,137
Have you lost your mind?

435
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,706
You're the one who put me here.

436
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,441
Eh, why you bringing
up old shit?

437
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,985
We'll talk about it later.

438
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,078
You cannot break me out.

439
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,614
There's a treaty with
the Fishermen Kingdom.

440
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:50,083
Look, I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

441
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,561
And you're the only
one that can help me.

442
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:52,853
So you do the math.

443
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,489
Oh, shit.

444
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,725
Come on, Cast Away.
Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

445
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:00,493
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,843
This changes nothing.

447
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,717
Wouldn't have it any
other way, little brother.

448
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,848
Do not call me "brother."

449
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,418
<i>Hermanito?</i> Come on.

450
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,959
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

451
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:34,127
Wake up and open the door.

452
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:37,062
Topo?

453
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:40,200
The cephalopod?

454
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,102
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

455
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:45,071
Topo!

456
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,551
All right, come on.

457
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,661
Wait.

458
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:12,599
Did you... bring water?

459
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:13,633
Yeah.

460
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,568
Uh, no, sorry.

461
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,070
I drank it all on the way here.

462
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:20,440
- What?
- Bro, it's hot up there.

463
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,698
Whoa! Easy.

464
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,701
Whoa!

465
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:53,249
You know how to
ride one of these?

466
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:54,708
Are you kidding?

467
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,052
I don't even know
what the hell it is.

468
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:57,076
- Hyaah!
- What?

469
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:03,984
Yeah!

470
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,128
Yeah!

471
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,630
Whoa.

472
00:43:35,148 --> 00:43:37,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

473
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,090
All right, the
water's right there.

474
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:18,258
Let's go, skinny jeans.

475
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:11,271
Yeah. All right.

476
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:13,006
Good job, little
brother. High-five.

477
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,707
No.

478
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,743
All right. Good job.

479
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:28,121
You know, I got a bunch of king
shit to do back in Atlantis

480
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:29,756
so we should go.

481
00:46:30,857 --> 00:46:32,692
Ahh! Come on, Topo!

482
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:58,017
This is worse than I could
have possibly imagined.

483
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:01,522
The safety and security of
Atlantis is a sacred trust.

484
00:47:01,555 --> 00:47:04,257
No king has allowed the great
city wall to be breached

485
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,759
in a hundred generations.

486
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:08,529
A hundred generations? Really?

487
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:10,763
How many years is that?
I'm bad with geology.

488
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:13,166
What is that, like,
a million years?

489
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,102
Oh? You're calling
me one in a million?

490
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:19,138
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

491
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,241
It's undignified
for a king to jest.

492
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,510
Oh, excuse me, Your
Highness, if I use comedy

493
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:26,112
to mask my feelings
and deal with stress.

494
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,390
Otherwise, I'd end
up looking like you.

495
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:29,450
A very tight butthole.

496
00:47:30,316 --> 00:47:33,420
Super tight.

497
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:37,023
You know, if the pressures of
leadership are too stressful,

498
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,925
perhaps you should leave

499
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,227
and let someone who knows
what they're doing be king.

500
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:45,331
You know what?

501
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:48,085
I cannot wait to throw your ass back
in prison when this is all over.

502
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,203
You won't have to.

503
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:52,114
Once I stop David Kane, I'll
surrender myself to the Fishermen.

504
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:54,240
That is my honor to Atlantis.

505
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:56,976
You're so dramatic.

506
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,279
Whatever. Just help
me find this asshole.

507
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:01,848
Well, my contact will at
least know where to look.

508
00:48:03,983 --> 00:48:05,385
What happened to him?

509
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,456
David Kane that I
knew was ruthless,

510
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,891
but he wasn't insane.

511
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:15,161
<i>This guy just put a gun to the
world's head and pulled the trigger.</i>

512
00:48:15,194 --> 00:48:17,163
<i>Without even making any demands.</i>

513
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:23,062
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

514
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:25,377
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

515
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,934
Well, you found it.

516
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:31,237
All I did was figure
out how it worked.

517
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,541
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

518
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:37,143
Yeah, well, what can I say?

519
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:39,078
Things don't always
go as planned.

520
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,312
But that's what I'm afraid of.

521
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:46,919
David, this stuff could
reshape the entire planet.

522
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,858
Hey, doc.

523
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:59,660
We are this close to unlocking the
greatest power in human history.

524
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:04,070
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

525
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:09,942
If I said yes, would you let me?

526
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:13,312
Sure.

527
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:17,935
You want to see how long
you last in that jungle?

528
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,987
Be my guest.

529
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:35,469
Yeah, I'll stick around.

530
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:39,706
Yeah.

531
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:57,390
<i>Welcome to the last frontier.</i>

532
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:01,060
<i>They scavenged ships from around
the world to build this place.</i>

533
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:03,996
<i>The Sunken Citadel.</i>

534
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,499
<i>It is the one place in the world</i>

535
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,967
<i>where the scum of the
land and sea mingle.</i>

536
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,438
<i>It is where people
come to disappear.</i>

537
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:12,472
<i>Wow.</i>

538
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:16,543
It's an impressive shithole.

539
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:18,679
How have I never heard
of this place before?

540
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:21,380
It is not meant to
be common knowledge.

541
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:22,416
It's a pirate haven.

542
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:24,484
Pirates?

543
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,730
Listen, I don't know if
you know this about me,

544
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:30,156
but I'm not too
popular with pirates.

545
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,033
Oh, I'm well aware.

546
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:50,611
Relax. It was the only
way to get us both in.

547
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:55,692
You could've at least
given me a heads up.

548
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:57,149
Would you have
gone along with it?

549
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:59,285
- Hell, no.
- Then put a hook in it.

550
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,654
There. That's Kingfish.

551
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:35,789
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

552
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:39,426
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

553
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,327
Cool.

554
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,496
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

555
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:45,231
Just let me handle this.

556
00:52:45,264 --> 00:52:47,099
He's our best shot
at finding Manta,

557
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,373
and he's not going to tell us
anything if you go in there

558
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:51,137
flexing your muscles at him.

559
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:56,175
You're so lucky we didn't grow
up together, little brother.

560
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:00,279
Do not call me "brother."

561
00:53:00,313 --> 00:53:01,615
Well...

562
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:05,886
This is a bit of a
surprise, isn't it?

563
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,288
I didn't realize you'd
been released from prison.

564
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:12,358
It is a recent development.

565
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:16,195
Outlaws, aren't we all?

566
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,633
We need to find David Kane.

567
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,603
Bad news, I'm afraid.

568
00:53:22,636 --> 00:53:26,305
David Kane is no
longer on the market.

569
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,342
Not for sale at any price.

570
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:33,814
He's solely running as
an independent operator.

571
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:35,849
Where is he holed up now?

572
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:41,822
In exchange, I offer a favor...

573
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:46,392
from the King of Atlantis.

574
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:50,573
You seriously expect me to
play footsie with someone

575
00:53:50,597 --> 00:53:52,532
with that kind of
blood on their hands?

576
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:54,935
I don't have hands!

577
00:53:54,968 --> 00:53:56,536
Or feet!

578
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,643
Um...

579
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:06,345
Listen, if the information
checks out good,

580
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:09,483
I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

581
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:10,851
and tear this place apart.

582
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:15,689
That's too bad.

583
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:17,858
Traditionally, the
kings of Atlantis

584
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:22,529
have turned a blind eye
to the Sunken Citadel.

585
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:26,365
Now, we have to
blind it for you.

586
00:54:34,808 --> 00:54:36,910
Fine. Flex your muscles.

587
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:50,824
Smash his stupid head in!

588
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:53,192
Boom!

589
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:10,276
Gotcha, fatback!

590
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:16,717
Okay! Okay! We can
work this out. We can.

591
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,452
Talk.

592
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,921
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

593
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:23,557
A dormant volcano in
the South Pacific,

594
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,224
called "Devil's Deep."

595
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:27,259
Talk faster.

596
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:28,729
It's been barren for years.

597
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:30,897
But travelers say there's
a jungle there now.

598
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,700
Navigation gets scrambled as
soon as you start to get close.

599
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:36,703
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

600
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:39,740
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

601
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:41,942
I'd say that's where
Kane is hiding out.

602
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,246
We got all we needed. Let's go!

603
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:02,596
<i>♪ Rise up, come Rise
up through the fire ♪</i>

604
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,303
Soon you'll be more
powerful than he is.

605
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:13,440
But you're not ready yet,

606
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:16,308
and you involved
him far too soon.

607
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:18,945
I sense them closing in on us.

608
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,447
Do I seem concerned?

609
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:22,549
Hmm?

610
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:25,585
If anything, it's
even easier now.

611
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,788
We couldn't have planned
it any better than...

612
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,962
Oh. Oh.

613
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:38,031
Hey.

614
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:41,001
Uh, I... I just wanted to tell
you that the orichalcum furnace

615
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,803
is now running at peak output.

616
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:36,690
I win.

617
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:44,531
Topo, go back to Atlantis and
give them our coordinates.

618
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,116
You know what'd be
amazing right now?

619
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,942
Reinforcements?

620
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:58,136
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

621
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:01,948
You gotta admit, the food
is so much better up here.

622
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,516
I find that hard to believe.

623
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,552
Hold up.

624
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:06,963
You telling me you never went
topside to have a cheeseburger?

625
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:10,457
- What?
- Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

626
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,926
Or a thick, juicy,
medium raw steak

627
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:14,828
with fries and a shake,
and you dip it...

628
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:17,530
Even the words that
surface-dwellers give their food

629
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:20,667
sound disgusting.

630
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,837
You've let your prejudices stop
you from enjoying half the world.

631
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,040
You should think about
that. It's your loss, dude.

632
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:37,150
Aw, yeah!

633
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,519
Bet you never had one of these.

634
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:42,522
- What is it?
- It's a cockroach.

635
00:58:42,555 --> 00:58:45,125
- You eat it?
- Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

636
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:02,976
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Eh?

637
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:04,711
That's good. Here, drink this.

638
00:59:08,915 --> 00:59:10,050
Okay, you first.

639
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:44,918
Are you seeing this?

640
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:49,089
That's not normal?

641
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:56,162
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

642
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:00,567
Let's get out of here.

643
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,635
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

644
01:00:02,669 --> 01:00:05,872
I bet it mutated the flora and
fauna in a short amount of time,

645
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:08,241
turning them... monstrous.

646
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:09,274
Whoa.

647
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:19,819
Oh, shit...

648
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,133
Run!

649
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:36,869
Come on.

650
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:40,540
Faster!

651
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:49,049
What the hell are you doing?

652
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:50,717
I don't know. I'm
not used to running.

653
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,152
Just do what I do.

654
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:53,865
Use your arms, use your
legs. Lift them up.

655
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,155
Like this?

656
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,691
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

657
01:00:58,725 --> 01:00:59,993
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

658
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,188
Whoa!

659
01:01:32,392 --> 01:01:34,194
We have to jump. We'll
survive the fall.

660
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:36,129
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

661
01:01:36,162 --> 01:01:39,099
What do you wanna do, stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

662
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:41,901
What is that? What
does that say?

663
01:01:41,935 --> 01:01:43,379
The writing is
ancient Atlantean.

664
01:01:43,403 --> 01:01:46,606
"A true king builds bridges."

665
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:52,712
What are you doing?

666
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,719
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

667
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:29,716
See? A true king
builds bridges.

668
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:34,721
That's a metaphor!

669
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:36,856
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

670
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,191
Mom says she loves you.

671
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:40,326
She thinks about
you all the time.

672
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,695
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

673
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,129
I don't know. I'm just tired of
waiting for the right moment.

674
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:53,006
Come on.

675
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,236
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

676
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,914
Uh, David? I just
ran more tests,

677
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:36,483
and this data is
really disturbing.

678
01:03:36,517 --> 01:03:39,719
We have to stop burning
the... orichalcum.

679
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:43,022
David?

680
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,896
Oh.

681
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:57,230
Okay, doc, you want to
know my plan so bad.

682
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,534
Here it is.

683
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:05,472
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and
destroy everything he holds dear.

684
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:10,810
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

685
01:05:11,944 --> 01:05:16,316
I will avenge my father.

686
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:19,352
Even if I have to make a
deal with the devil to do it.

687
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:23,256
David, you can't
trust the trident.

688
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:34,000
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

689
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,339
Pray I never show
it to you again.

690
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,467
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

691
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,968
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

692
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:11,037
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

693
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,516
Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm not
asking for your advice on this.

694
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,476
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

695
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:17,977
So you can go on back to
Azkaban for all I care.

696
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,912
So, what's your plan?

697
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:21,624
I don't have one, yet.
But he came after my wife,

698
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:24,317
which means I'm gonna pull
his tongue out of his butt.

699
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,086
Arthur, you are the king. You
cannot let this get personal.

700
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,666
This coming from the guy who turned
the entire nation of Atlantis

701
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,391
into his own private ego trip?

702
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:33,059
My ego?

703
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:34,437
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

704
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:36,262
and challenged my
claim for the throne.

705
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:38,140
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

706
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:41,134
If you weren't such an
asshole, you'd still be king.

707
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,536
Unbelievable.

708
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:44,203
Wait, wait! Wait!

709
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:46,172
You took my throne and
you don't even want it?

710
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:48,941
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

711
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:51,721
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

712
01:06:51,745 --> 01:06:53,480
And I might even be
screwing that up.

713
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:54,724
You really had no
ambition for it?

714
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:56,483
Absolutely not.

715
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,552
From the day my father
found out you existed,

716
01:06:58,585 --> 01:07:00,362
he prepared me for the
moment that you would come

717
01:07:00,386 --> 01:07:01,598
and challenge me for the throne.

718
01:07:01,622 --> 01:07:03,322
Wow, that's really sad.

719
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:04,701
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

720
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:07,226
with basically no
prep time whatsoever.

721
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,395
Roasted.

722
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,164
That is not how it happened.

723
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:13,008
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

724
01:07:13,032 --> 01:07:14,967
No, she didn't. I
kicked your ass.

725
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:16,746
Nope. She made the little
water tornado. I fell in it.

726
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,490
Okay, shut up. I
think we're here.

727
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,549
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

728
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:30,049
Come on, let's do this.

729
01:07:30,082 --> 01:07:31,418
Once this is over with,

730
01:07:31,452 --> 01:07:33,019
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

731
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:34,597
- Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

732
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:36,289
I don't even know those words.

733
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:49,101
- Huh?
- Shh!

734
01:08:03,382 --> 01:08:04,451
Hey!

735
01:08:38,585 --> 01:08:40,019
Whoa, brother.

736
01:08:43,155 --> 01:08:44,223
<i>Sasa!</i>

737
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,164
It's an orichalcum furnace.

738
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,067
All that stolen orichalcum.

739
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:56,670
They're just burning it up.

740
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,105
He's heating the
atmosphere on purpose.

741
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:00,707
This is catastrophic.

742
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:03,242
This whole place must be
heat-shielded to protect it

743
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:05,546
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

744
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:07,179
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

745
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:08,582
To take out this reactor,

746
01:09:08,615 --> 01:09:10,316
we would have to crater
the entire island.

747
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:14,186
Get away from there! Now!

748
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:18,391
This blaster may be ancient, but it
was built for killing Atlanteans.

749
01:09:24,731 --> 01:09:27,099
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

750
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:29,813
I just didn't want you to break me
in half before I could surrender.

751
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:32,439
Please take me with you.

752
01:09:34,173 --> 01:09:36,643
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

753
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:38,745
No, no. Wait, please.

754
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:40,547
I didn't want any of this.

755
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:43,650
All I wanted was to see
Atlantis with my own eyes.

756
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,786
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

757
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:50,122
I'm a scientist, and I just
wanted to be taken seriously.

758
01:09:50,156 --> 01:09:51,491
David Kane said
he could help me,

759
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:53,359
but now he won't let me leave.

760
01:09:53,392 --> 01:09:56,329
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

761
01:09:57,363 --> 01:09:58,832
I know.

762
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:01,167
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

763
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,604
But he would've
killed me if I hadn't.

764
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:05,672
Knock him out.

765
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,408
No.

766
01:10:08,442 --> 01:10:10,242
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

767
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,145
- What?
- No.

768
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:15,549
Fine!

769
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,751
You can come with us.

770
01:10:17,784 --> 01:10:19,820
Oh... thank you.

771
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:22,656
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one <i>sasa!</i>

772
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:24,156
Okay, okay.

773
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,525
It's the black trident.

774
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,694
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

775
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:29,429
It gives Kane great
powers and in return...

776
01:10:46,947 --> 01:10:49,315
I hate when that happens.

777
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:03,563
Stop them!

778
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:08,054
Whoa!

779
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:09,656
Ow!

780
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:11,323
Ow!

781
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:19,533
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the orichalcum!

782
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:20,734
You wanna blow us up?

783
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,569
- This stuff blows up?
- Yes!

784
01:13:22,602 --> 01:13:24,971
My bad!

785
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,476
Then stop using it!

786
01:13:29,509 --> 01:13:31,310
Just shut up and let
me save your ass.

787
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:32,879
Again.

788
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:58,832
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

789
01:14:58,865 --> 01:15:00,467
I told you he's stronger now.

790
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,670
He's still just a
surface-dweller.

791
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:13,980
- Bro!
- Bah!

792
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:22,756
I never expected to see you
two fighting side by side.

793
01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:25,025
We're making a special
exception just for you.

794
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:33,033
No one hits my brother but me.

795
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:37,637
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

796
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,072
You're making this easy.

797
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:54,120
Yeah!

798
01:15:54,154 --> 01:15:56,523
Come at me, the killer of kings.

799
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,651
Take that island down!

800
01:17:21,841 --> 01:17:23,109
Fire at will!

801
01:17:34,954 --> 01:17:36,556
We've got to get out of here.

802
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,735
Malfunction. Malfunction.

803
01:17:48,768 --> 01:17:50,036
Warning. Warning.

804
01:18:16,062 --> 01:18:17,697
Shin, let's go!

805
01:18:22,902 --> 01:18:24,304
What are you waiting for?

806
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:26,172
Fire the goddamn cannon!

807
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,938
I'm sorry to drag
you all into this.

808
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:34,211
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

809
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,478
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel. I do.

810
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:38,978
And the Brine Kingdom

811
01:19:39,012 --> 01:19:41,080
has not forgotten
its debt to you.

812
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:43,349
You may count on us always.

813
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:45,486
Something happened to me.

814
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:48,254
When I touched
that black trident.

815
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,457
Why is he even here?

816
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:52,258
He should be on his
way back to prison.

817
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,060
We should hear
what he has to say.

818
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:55,962
I made that mistake once.

819
01:19:55,995 --> 01:19:58,198
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

820
01:19:58,231 --> 01:20:01,468
And he cut off my claw.

821
01:20:01,502 --> 01:20:04,137
This thing took a whole
year to grow back.

822
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,739
Look, he wants to stop
Manta same as we do.

823
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,341
And just for the record,

824
01:20:08,374 --> 01:20:10,494
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

825
01:20:12,912 --> 01:20:14,214
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

826
01:20:18,184 --> 01:20:20,887
Mom, I don't know
enough about this.

827
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,922
Is that even possible?

828
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:25,892
All anyone knows for sure is
there once was a seventh kingdom

829
01:20:25,925 --> 01:20:28,962
and then one day,
just before the fall,

830
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:32,065
every record of it was
stricken from the chronicles.

831
01:20:32,098 --> 01:20:34,834
How do you know what you
saw was the Lost Kingdom?

832
01:20:34,867 --> 01:20:37,870
No one even knows what
it was called anymore.

833
01:20:37,904 --> 01:20:39,272
It's called Necrus.

834
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,975
And I didn't just see it.

835
01:20:43,276 --> 01:20:44,277
I knew it.

836
01:20:45,912 --> 01:20:49,215
It's almost like I
was... remembering it.

837
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:54,120
Flashes of someone
else's memories.

838
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,889
During King Atlan's time,

839
01:20:56,923 --> 01:21:01,160
there were seven united
kingdoms of Atlantis.

840
01:21:01,194 --> 01:21:05,064
And the Black City was
a curse upon them all.

841
01:21:11,938 --> 01:21:13,840
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

842
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:17,076
<i>Necrus rapidly became a
superpower unlike any other.</i>

843
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:18,978
But it came at a terrible price.

844
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:22,215
<i>Poisoning the land, the sea,</i>

845
01:21:22,248 --> 01:21:25,084
<i>even the mind of the
tyrant who ruled Necrus.</i>

846
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,990
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

847
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:32,901
<i>Atlan pleaded with him</i>

848
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:35,028
<i>to stop using it
before the world</i>

849
01:21:35,061 --> 01:21:36,896
<i>was irrevocably damaged.</i>

850
01:21:36,929 --> 01:21:39,433
<i>However, Kordax resented Atlan,</i>

851
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:42,335
<i>thinking his own brother was
trying to steal his power.</i>

852
01:21:42,368 --> 01:21:47,840
<i>So, he resorted to dark magic and
crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

853
01:21:47,874 --> 01:21:49,208
<i>That black trident.</i>

854
01:21:59,285 --> 01:22:02,155
<i>He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...</i>

855
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:08,294
to fight Atlantis.

856
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:10,029
So, the two brothers
went to war.

857
01:22:19,305 --> 01:22:21,240
<i>But Atlan defeated Kordax</i>

858
01:22:21,274 --> 01:22:24,277
<i>and imprisoned him
and all of Necrus</i>

859
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:27,246
<i>with a spell cast
with his own blood...</i>

860
01:22:30,517 --> 01:22:35,589
<i>to ensure that Kordax's dark
power would never be found.</i>

861
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:38,324
<i>And that is why Necrus is
stricken from the chronicles.</i>

862
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:52,905
This evil was supposed to
remain frozen for eternity.

863
01:22:55,409 --> 01:22:57,009
But David Kane has found it.

864
01:22:58,612 --> 01:23:01,582
<i>And it's slowly possessing him.</i>

865
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:03,417
But even with the
ice cap melting,

866
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,486
Kordax still can't be freed.

867
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:08,187
Atlan used blood magic to
seal Kordax in his prison.

868
01:23:08,221 --> 01:23:10,156
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

869
01:23:10,189 --> 01:23:11,658
Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

870
01:23:11,692 --> 01:23:15,161
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

871
01:23:15,194 --> 01:23:17,230
Blood magic isn't
really magic, it's DNA.

872
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:22,436
The key to Kordax's prison is
the royal bloodline itself.

873
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:25,938
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

874
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:29,547
We're the end of the bloodline.

875
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,315
No, we're not.

876
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:38,994
<i>Wildfires would have made
headlines across the world,</i>

877
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:41,320
<i>but now, they're almost
a weekly occurrence.</i>

878
01:23:41,354 --> 01:23:44,425
<i>We're witnessing unprecedented
weather events across the globe,</i>

879
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:46,125
<i>and meteorologists are at a loss</i>

880
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,027
<i>to explain this rapid
change in climate.</i>

881
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,696
<i>From sweltering
heatwaves and droughts,</i>

882
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:51,732
<i>which are shattering
temperature records,</i>

883
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:53,434
<i>to torrential rains
and floodings...</i>

884
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,602
- What is going on?
<i>- Hurricane bearing down</i>

885
01:23:55,636 --> 01:23:58,104
<i>on the East Coast, leaving one
million homes without power...</i>

886
01:24:00,441 --> 01:24:03,309
Make that a million and one.

887
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:05,446
I gotta get the
flashlight, bubba.

888
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:26,500
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

889
01:24:35,174 --> 01:24:36,410
Dad!

890
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:38,110
- Tom!
- Dad!

891
01:24:39,345 --> 01:24:40,346
Tom!

892
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:43,216
No! Dad!

893
01:24:43,249 --> 01:24:44,350
Where's Junior?

894
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:49,523
No!

895
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:51,257
I'm sorry, son.

896
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,159
Where's Junior?

897
01:24:53,192 --> 01:24:56,597
Manta... took Junior.

898
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,465
- No!
- No!

899
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:01,033
No!

900
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,725
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

901
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:00,460
He will be okay.

902
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:02,161
We just picked up a signal.

903
01:26:02,194 --> 01:26:04,096
It's faint,

904
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,600
but it's broadcasting on an
old Atlantean sonar frequency.

905
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:08,401
Headed to Antarctica.

906
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:11,838
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

907
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:16,208
I've dreamed of this.

908
01:26:16,242 --> 01:26:18,645
The two of you standing
together as brothers.

909
01:26:22,616 --> 01:26:24,651
Promise me you will
protect each other.

910
01:26:28,154 --> 01:26:29,823
Promise me, Orm.

911
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,805
Go.

912
01:27:11,297 --> 01:27:13,834
Great waves, Nereus.

913
01:27:13,867 --> 01:27:18,438
Your warship is powerful, but
it's slower than a sea cow.

914
01:27:18,472 --> 01:27:23,342
I say we ditch all this dead
weight and travel light. Hmm?

915
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,755
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

916
01:27:25,779 --> 01:27:27,681
Our only chance is to hit him

917
01:27:27,714 --> 01:27:30,417
with total overwhelming
force from every direction.

918
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,419
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

919
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:33,754
What choice do we have?

920
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:35,555
We have no defense
against that cannon.

921
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:36,923
Well, wait a minute.

922
01:27:36,957 --> 01:27:38,725
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

923
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,827
that messes with our
nervous system, right?

924
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:43,830
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

925
01:27:43,864 --> 01:27:45,499
Well, what if we
disrupt those echoes

926
01:27:45,532 --> 01:27:47,400
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

927
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:49,536
but just much, much louder?

928
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:52,238
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

929
01:27:52,271 --> 01:27:53,671
Well, that's gonna
be the easy part.

930
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,677
Take your weapons.

931
01:27:58,277 --> 01:27:59,579
And ready your steeds.

932
01:28:08,722 --> 01:28:09,990
Hmm.

933
01:28:20,266 --> 01:28:22,301
Really doesn't
like you, does he?

934
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:55,836
We made a lot of progress, doc.

935
01:28:55,869 --> 01:28:58,270
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

936
01:28:58,304 --> 01:28:59,773
but we were damn close.

937
01:28:59,806 --> 01:29:02,274
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

938
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:07,547
My God, what did we do?

939
01:29:07,581 --> 01:29:10,316
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

940
01:29:10,349 --> 01:29:12,919
All we did was fast
forward things a few years.

941
01:29:12,953 --> 01:29:14,564
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,

942
01:29:14,588 --> 01:29:16,523
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

943
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:18,725
Here.

944
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:20,927
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

945
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:24,498
Power up the sonic cannon.

946
01:29:26,032 --> 01:29:27,501
Bag the child and suit up.

947
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,564
Yah!

948
01:29:57,597 --> 01:29:59,757
Captain, we have multiple
incoming hostiles.

949
01:30:01,601 --> 01:30:02,736
You're too late.

950
01:30:12,612 --> 01:30:13,612
No.

951
01:30:39,506 --> 01:30:41,141
Commence charge.

952
01:31:31,691 --> 01:31:34,928
You've got to be kidding me.

953
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:12,132
Astounding.

954
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:57,777
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

955
01:32:57,811 --> 01:33:00,146
The throne of Necrus is
in the heart of the city.

956
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,657
I sense something in the water.

957
01:33:01,681 --> 01:33:02,921
Everyone, light it up.

958
01:33:07,721 --> 01:33:12,625
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

959
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:14,294
Yes. I did.

960
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:16,596
Keep your eyes open.

961
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:19,632
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

962
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:22,235
Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

963
01:33:27,273 --> 01:33:29,809
Fire at will!

964
01:33:46,059 --> 01:33:47,336
I think this goes
all the way through.

965
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,563
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

966
01:33:50,597 --> 01:33:53,299
Go now and save the prince.

967
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:54,834
Thank you, Your Highness.

968
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,873
Come on, you spineless worms!

969
01:33:59,906 --> 01:34:01,141
Bring it on!

970
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:11,144
Help me!

971
01:36:14,207 --> 01:36:16,109
Give me the child.

972
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:13,900
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, doc.

973
01:37:17,438 --> 01:37:19,872
Get behind the portcullis!

974
01:37:19,906 --> 01:37:23,009
We need to close the gate!

975
01:37:59,979 --> 01:38:03,016
Get away from my son!

976
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:06,019
Your blood will do just fine.

977
01:38:07,954 --> 01:38:11,157
You want blood? Come get it!

978
01:38:25,004 --> 01:38:26,440
Aquaman!

979
01:39:00,106 --> 01:39:01,475
Oh!

980
01:39:15,021 --> 01:39:18,592
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident,

981
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:21,428
but you're only
half the man he was.

982
01:39:21,462 --> 01:39:24,297
How pathetic.

983
01:39:38,645 --> 01:39:40,012
Mera!

984
01:39:55,328 --> 01:39:56,396
Go!

985
01:40:11,077 --> 01:40:12,679
Mera...

986
01:40:14,046 --> 01:40:15,047
Run!

987
01:40:19,085 --> 01:40:21,254
Free me from my prison,

988
01:40:21,287 --> 01:40:26,959
and all my power will be
yours to wield as you desire.

989
01:41:02,663 --> 01:41:07,233
<i>Kill him, and you will
be Ocean Master again!</i>

990
01:41:15,074 --> 01:41:17,578
Well, now this is
certainly an improvement.

991
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:20,447
Powerful, Atlantean body.

992
01:41:20,481 --> 01:41:23,784
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

993
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:25,294
It's not true. Come
on, little brother.

994
01:41:25,318 --> 01:41:26,653
I know you're in there.

995
01:41:26,687 --> 01:41:29,222
Don't you see? You can't win.

996
01:41:29,255 --> 01:41:32,526
Either you kill your
brother or you die.

997
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:52,311
By an Atlan's blood,
this magic is broken.

998
01:42:05,526 --> 01:42:09,028
My eternal night is ending.

999
01:42:16,202 --> 01:42:18,639
I'm done fighting
your puppets, Kordax.

1000
01:42:19,806 --> 01:42:22,074
I'm coming for you.

1001
01:42:25,144 --> 01:42:26,154
- Give it to me!
- No!

1002
01:42:26,178 --> 01:42:27,748
I can end this.

1003
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:31,284
Don't let him take it! Hasn't
he taken enough already?

1004
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,287
Yield the throne.

1005
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,724
It's time for me to
reclaim my destiny.

1006
01:42:37,758 --> 01:42:40,661
It would be foolish to
think he could ever change.

1007
01:42:40,694 --> 01:42:42,596
I knew you would do this.

1008
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:44,498
You are the one true king.

1009
01:42:44,531 --> 01:42:48,100
Atlantis deserves
its one true king.

1010
01:42:50,369 --> 01:42:54,340
I am the one true king!

1011
01:43:01,715 --> 01:43:03,349
<i>You know, there was a time</i>

1012
01:43:03,382 --> 01:43:05,819
when I wanted to meet
you more than anything.

1013
01:43:05,852 --> 01:43:07,821
Let you know that
you weren't alone,

1014
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:09,756
that we were in it together.

1015
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:11,692
<i>Promise me you'll
protect each other.</i>

1016
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:20,601
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

1017
01:43:20,634 --> 01:43:23,904
I meant what I said
when I first met you.

1018
01:43:23,937 --> 01:43:26,673
No matter what,
you are not alone.

1019
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:28,140
We're in this together.

1020
01:43:31,578 --> 01:43:32,846
You are my brother.

1021
01:43:38,518 --> 01:43:39,518
Orm.

1022
01:43:42,522 --> 01:43:43,523
Let go.

1023
01:43:58,404 --> 01:43:59,640
Orm, let it go.

1024
01:44:19,325 --> 01:44:22,596
I live again!

1025
01:44:22,629 --> 01:44:26,566
I have waited countless
centuries in the dark

1026
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,300
for this moment.

1027
01:44:34,474 --> 01:44:35,642
Shit.

1028
01:44:43,382 --> 01:44:44,584
Arthur!

1029
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:12,338
Never.

1030
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:23,382
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

1031
01:46:38,565 --> 01:46:39,633
Let's get outta here!

1032
01:46:52,012 --> 01:46:53,847
Hurry!

1033
01:46:57,884 --> 01:46:59,786
That's right!

1034
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,421
Come on, baby! Yeah!

1035
01:47:17,537 --> 01:47:20,907
Yeah!

1036
01:47:38,825 --> 01:47:39,826
My love.

1037
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:43,897
Hi, baby boy.

1038
01:47:53,607 --> 01:47:54,607
Shin.

1039
01:47:55,108 --> 01:47:56,443
Thank you.

1040
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,484
Astounding.

1041
01:48:09,222 --> 01:48:12,759
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

1042
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:13,894
Well, I'm not.

1043
01:48:13,927 --> 01:48:15,996
My claw got cut off.

1044
01:48:16,029 --> 01:48:17,564
Again!

1045
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,209
You're one tough
crustacean, Your Highness.

1046
01:48:20,233 --> 01:48:21,735
Bah!

1047
01:48:21,768 --> 01:48:24,004
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

1048
01:48:25,538 --> 01:48:27,406
Not everybody's gonna
see it that way though.

1049
01:48:32,112 --> 01:48:34,681
It's too bad you went and had
yourself killed back there.

1050
01:48:36,716 --> 01:48:37,784
Yes.

1051
01:48:37,817 --> 01:48:38,985
All this ice.

1052
01:48:40,654 --> 01:48:42,756
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

1053
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:45,835
Just lay low for a while.

1054
01:48:45,859 --> 01:48:48,161
But don't go too far.

1055
01:48:48,194 --> 01:48:50,096
I may need to call you
up for some advice.

1056
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:53,033
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

1057
01:48:59,072 --> 01:49:00,173
Thank you...

1058
01:49:02,042 --> 01:49:03,710
brother.

1059
01:49:18,825 --> 01:49:20,894
You're not as bad at
this as you think.

1060
01:49:22,762 --> 01:49:25,565
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1061
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,868
You are everything I was not.

1062
01:49:28,902 --> 01:49:31,671
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

1063
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:34,574
And you're willing
to ask for help

1064
01:49:35,709 --> 01:49:37,043
even from your worst enemy.

1065
01:49:39,112 --> 01:49:40,714
I know it may not feel like

1066
01:49:40,747 --> 01:49:42,291
you know what you're
doing sometimes, but...

1067
01:49:42,315 --> 01:49:44,918
keep trusting your instincts.

1068
01:49:44,951 --> 01:49:47,821
If you lead,
Atlantis will follow.

1069
01:49:51,157 --> 01:49:54,594
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

1070
01:49:55,862 --> 01:49:57,222
I thought that was
just a metaphor.

1071
01:50:00,133 --> 01:50:04,971
Well, your metaphor might have
just saved the world's ass.

1072
01:50:28,995 --> 01:50:30,597
<i>We've got breaking news.</i>

1073
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:32,165
<i>We are witnessing history.</i>

1074
01:50:32,198 --> 01:50:34,267
<i>A moment the ramifications
of which simply...</i>

1075
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,300
<i>cannot be overstated.</i>

1076
01:50:38,271 --> 01:50:39,939
<i>A first contact...</i>

1077
01:50:39,973 --> 01:50:41,775
<i>with the undersea
nation of Atlantis.</i>

1078
01:50:41,808 --> 01:50:43,686
<i>An entire civilization
hidden for thousands of years</i>

1079
01:50:43,710 --> 01:50:45,211
<i>about to be revealed.</i>

1080
01:50:51,785 --> 01:50:53,095
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>

1081
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:54,621
<i>the world will
never be the same.</i>

1082
01:50:54,654 --> 01:50:56,022
<i>The King of Atlantis</i>

1083
01:50:56,056 --> 01:50:57,690
<i>has reached out to
the United Nations</i>

1084
01:50:57,724 --> 01:50:59,626
<i>and will be officially
seeking membership.</i>

1085
01:50:59,659 --> 01:51:00,703
<i>And is expected to
propose a joint effort</i>

1086
01:51:00,727 --> 01:51:02,328
<i>to reverse the climate issues.</i>

1087
01:51:02,362 --> 01:51:04,173
<i>We are told that
this was the result</i>

1088
01:51:04,197 --> 01:51:06,766
<i>of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.</i>

1089
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,601
<i>We now go live to Ellis Island,</i>

1090
01:51:08,635 --> 01:51:10,346
<i>where the first official
ambassador from Atlantis</i>

1091
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:12,672
<i>is about to address
the United Nations.</i>

1092
01:51:21,681 --> 01:51:25,085
I come here today as a
representative of two worlds.

1093
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:27,654
The land and the sea.

1094
01:51:31,124 --> 01:51:35,361
<i>And I stand here as proof
that change is coming to both.</i>

1095
01:51:35,395 --> 01:51:41,167
<i>And I'm calling for global
unity for a global crisis.</i>

1096
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:43,269
<i>To finally bring
harmony between us</i>

1097
01:51:43,303 --> 01:51:46,372
<i>and the natural
balance of our world.</i>

1098
01:51:46,406 --> 01:51:48,241
<i>Atlantis stands ready
to help contribute</i>

1099
01:51:48,274 --> 01:51:50,777
<i>its science and technology.</i>

1100
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:52,413
<i>And with your
knowledge of the air,</i>

1101
01:51:52,446 --> 01:51:54,415
<i>and our knowledge of the seas,</i>

1102
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:57,418
<i>together we can write the
next chapter in our story,</i>

1103
01:51:57,451 --> 01:51:59,819
<i>rather than its ending.</i>

1104
01:51:59,853 --> 01:52:03,389
<i>Sometimes it's gonna seem like
our differences are too extreme,</i>

1105
01:52:03,424 --> 01:52:06,993
<i>but all we have to do is
look beneath the surface,</i>

1106
01:52:07,026 --> 01:52:08,695
<i>to see that we're all
here on this planet</i>

1107
01:52:08,728 --> 01:52:11,164
<i>with the same goals
and aspirations.</i>

1108
01:52:11,197 --> 01:52:12,775
<i>- Even when our customs...</i>
- Here you go.

1109
01:52:12,799 --> 01:52:13,733
<i>Might seem strange
and unfamiliar.</i>

1110
01:52:13,766 --> 01:52:15,301
Beer and a cheeseburger.

1111
01:52:15,335 --> 01:52:17,337
Extra greasy like you asked for.

1112
01:52:19,172 --> 01:52:21,741
<i>And by overcoming
our prejudices,</i>

1113
01:52:21,774 --> 01:52:25,145
<i>we'll become stronger and
learn more about ourselves.</i>

1114
01:52:25,178 --> 01:52:28,815
<i>We can seize this moment to create
a better more hopeful future,</i>

1115
01:52:28,848 --> 01:52:32,152
<i>for our children,
and our families.</i>

1116
01:52:33,753 --> 01:52:35,889
<i>My name is Arthur Curry.</i>

1117
01:52:35,922 --> 01:52:39,460
<i>I'm the rightful sovereign of
the undersea nation of Atlantis.</i>

1118
01:52:39,493 --> 01:52:41,694
<i>I'm a father, a brother,</i>

1119
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:44,164
a warrior and a friend.

1120
01:52:45,298 --> 01:52:47,200
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1121
01:52:48,868 --> 01:52:50,336
I am Aquaman.
