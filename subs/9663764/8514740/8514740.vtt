of ice sheet breaking off.

177
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.921
[man groaning]

178
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.093
[exhales]

179
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.865
- [loud thud]
- [gasping]

180
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.705
[yelps]

181
00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.841
[yells]

182
00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.177
[shudders]

183
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.255
[pounding thud]

184
00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.757
Come on. Get up.

185
00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:32.992
[groans]

186
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.028
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

187
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.230
Come on, get up. Go, we
gotta go! We gotta go!

188
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:41.367
Come on, we gotta
move! Come on!

189
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.011
[steady beeping]

190
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.648
[shrieks]

191
00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:02.021
[screaming]

192
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.258
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

193
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.829
[screaming]

194
00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:17.003
[scream echoes, fades]

195
00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:34.687
[Dr. Shin panting]

196
00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:37.991
What the hell happened to you?

197
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.428
[whispering] There's
something back there.

198
00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:58.311
[Dr. Shin] Astounding.

199
00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.447
My readings show
something's down here.

200
00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.450
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

201
00:13:03.484 --> 00:13:07.787
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

202
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.823
[David] How is this
place even possible?

203
00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:12.134
[Dr. Shin] This was
all probably solid ice

204
00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:15.361
until we started
heating the planet.

205
00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:18.765
[David] Well, thank God for
global warming, am I right?

206
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.801
[Dr. Shin] Uh, yeah, that's
not exactly a good thing.

207
00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.221
[David] The tracks
lead down there.

208
00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.924
Suit up.

209
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.861
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

210
00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.730
the monster's down there.

211
00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.236
[sighs]

212
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.338
Okay. I guess we're
going down there.

213
00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:02.008
[heavy splash]

214
00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:25.198
[laughs] I don't believe this.

215
00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.936
It's a structure of some kind.

216
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.573
And there's more
buried in the ice.

217
00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:35.975
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

218
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:39.446
- [David] Everyone, fan out and search.
- [man] Yes, sir.

219
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.348
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

220
00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.388
This has to be a few
thousand years old.

221
00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.023
Astounding.

222
00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.362
[camera shutter clicks]

223
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.864
Whoa.

224
00:14:58.632 --> 00:14:59.899
Uh...

225
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:14.481
[screaming]

226
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.184
[all yelling]

227
00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:36.570
[grunting]

228
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.441
[panting]

229
00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:41.475
Ow...

230
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.293
What is this place?

231
00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:06.326
[ghostly voice] <i>At
last, you are here.</i>

232
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.388
[violent grunting]

233
00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:34.127
[screaming]

234
00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:39.165
Free me from my prison

235
00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.301
and I will grant
you the strength

236
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:46.139
<i>to kill the man who
murdered your father.</i>

237
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.940
You can't leave him like this!

238
00:16:47.974 --> 00:16:49.676
You ask the sea for mercy.

239
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.678
Get out of here!
You need to live

240
00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:54.347
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

241
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.452
[ghostly voice] <i>You will take
from him what he stole from you.</i>

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.524
[ghostly voice]
<i>His home will burn</i>

244
00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:08.529
<i>and his kingdom will
fall before my legions.</i>

245
00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:16.335
- [yells, groaning]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

246
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.671
David. No, David.

247
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.372
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

248
00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.675
David. David, it's okay.

249
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.075
You're all right.

250
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.145
What the hell is that thing?

251
00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.639
[news anchor] <i>Just

[gasps, panting]

266
00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:24.505
The Council's called for
an emergency gathering.

267
00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:28.107
There's been another
plague outbreak.

268
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.310
[news anchor] <i>...scientists
are at a loss to explain.</i>

269
00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:33.346

270
00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.047
<i>how long will it continue?</i>

271
00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:37.316
<i>And how much hotter

272
00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.623
[Aquaman] Where did
it hit this time?

273
00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:44.758
[councilwoman] The
Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

274
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.593
and there are now
reports of outbreaks

275
00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:49.061
in the Fishermen
Kingdom as well.

276
00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:51.698
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

277
00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:53.734
Why now?

278
00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:57.169
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

279
00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.205
Take your pick.

280
00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:04.545
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

281
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:06.556
You can't expect them to
care about what happens to us

282
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.282
if they don't even
know we exist.

283
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.827
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

284
00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:13.252
we have to take our
seat at the table.

285
00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.461
It's time for Atlantis to
reveal itself to the surface.

286
00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:25.599
[council members grumbling]

287
00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:28.635
Your majesty is well aware of
the Council's position on this.

288
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.137
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

289
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.107
and combine our technologies to reverse
the damage that they've already done.

290
00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:37.711
And I know this is
against our traditions,

291
00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.446
but the world is shrinking,

292
00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:41.515
and the old ways aren't
gonna protect us anymore.

293
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:44.183
Times have changed.

294
00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.787
Atlantis wants this.

295
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.220
There's a whole
generation out there

296
00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:49.756
that don't want to hide anymore.

297
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.225
Have you already
forgotten that this plague

298
00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:56.228
killed your own beloved mentor,

299
00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:59.666
and you want to
negotiate with them?

300
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.738
We gave your brother war powers and
made him Ocean Master for a reason.

301
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:08.842
If we ever decide to make ourselves
known to the surface-dwellers,

302
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.813
it will be to eradicate
them, not to co-exist.

303
00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:20.621
[thunder rumbling]

304
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.390

[thunder rumbling]

306
00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:43.309
[Tom] Hey, not bad.

307
00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:47.948
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

308
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.816
[Aquaman] I don't know
how you did it, Pops.

309
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.952
Mera and I have the
whole kingdom helping us,

310
00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:54.454
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

311
00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:56.890
And you...

312
00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.226
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

313
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.731
[sighs]

314
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.533
You're the real superhero.

315
00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:11.672
- To single parents.
- Mmm.

316
00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:17.276
Well, my job was a little
less stressful than yours.

317
00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.681
Yeah, well, I just
plain suck at my job.

318
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:24.383
Vulko told me to bring the
land and the sea together.

319
00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:28.789
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

320
00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:31.290
They won't listen. I
can't bring shit together.

321
00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:34.393
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

322
00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:35.662
I know.

323
00:21:37.898 --> 00:21:39.298
I miss him.

324
00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.470
Hey.

325
00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.475
You can't save them all, son.

326
00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:52.244
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

327
00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.550
I just kept going.

328
00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:59.820
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

329
00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:02.489
And you wake up the next
day and you do it again.

330
00:22:02.522 --> 00:22:04.591
Sometimes not giving up

331
00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:06.960
is the most heroic
thing you can do.

332
00:22:10.063 --> 00:22:14.366

333

[groans]

334
00:23:05.986 --> 00:23:08.522
Humans were not made to
live at these depths.

335
00:23:09.623 --> 00:23:11.825
Yeah, don't worry about that.

336
00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:14.694
You just remember
who built this ship.

337
00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.097
I'm more worried about how
long ago they built it.

338
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.698
[sniffles]

339
00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:21.835

[David] Hey, doc.

344
00:23:41.454 --> 00:23:43.723
You stand ready with
that big gun of yours.

dangerous mission yet.

<i>how is he supposed

465
00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:59.165
He's different now. He's
stronger than before.

466
00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:01.200
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

467
00:35:01.234 --> 00:35:03.470
And where the hell did he
get all the new toys from?

468
00:35:03.504 --> 00:35:05.071
The technology seems ancient,

469
00:35:05.104 --> 00:35:07.340
but we've never seen
anything like it.

470
00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:11.344
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

471
00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:13.179
that disrupts the
nervous system.

472
00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:14.615
Do we know what was stolen?

473
00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:18.719
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

474
00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:22.321
Am I supposed to
know what that is?

475
00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:25.592
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

476
00:35:25.626 --> 00:35:28.327
It emits tremendous
amounts of greenhouse gases

477
00:35:28.361 --> 00:35:30.196
that are highly
destructive to our planet.

478
00:35:30.229 --> 00:35:33.099
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

479
00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:35.669
before we realized
what we were doing.

480
00:35:35.702 --> 00:35:39.372
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

481
00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:43.075
has been buried in 12 storage
vaults deep underground.

482
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:44.787
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

483
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:47.581
He's already been
there. It's all gone.

484
00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:49.550
We think he's been
launching secret raids

485
00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:51.451
for at least five months.

486
00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:53.119
This is just the
time he got caught.

487
00:35:53.152 --> 00:35:54.597
Well, this spike in
global temperatures

488
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:56.623
that's causing
disasters on the surface

489
00:35:56.657 --> 00:36:01.495
and making the sea dwellers
sick happened five months ago.

490
00:36:01.528 --> 00:36:04.631
He's using the stolen
orichalcum to heat the planet.

491
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.502
Why would he do that?

492
00:36:08.535 --> 00:36:10.704
[Aquaman] I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

493
00:36:10.737 --> 00:36:14.140
If he is using the orichalcum to heat
the planet, we don't have much time.

494
00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:16.242
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

495
00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:20.581
He must be stopped or a global
climate meltdown is imminent.

496
00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:22.214
[Nereus] We need to find him,

497
00:36:22.248 --> 00:36:23.793
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

498
00:36:23.817 --> 00:36:26.152
I think I know someone who
might be able to help us.

499
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:28.722
But you're not gonna like it.

500
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:32.459
Your brother?

501
00:36:32.492 --> 00:36:34.571
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

502
00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:36.630
but he's dealt with
Manta in the past,

503
00:36:36.663 --> 00:36:38.741
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

504
00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:42.536
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

505
00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.671
He killed their king.

506
00:36:44.705 --> 00:36:47.239
I wasn't exactly gonna
ask for permission.

507
00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:51.612
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

508
00:36:51.645 --> 00:36:53.814
It would be an act of war.

509
00:36:55.314 --> 00:36:56.850
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

510
00:36:58.184 --> 00:37:00.219
I'm gonna break him out myself.

511
00:37:00.252 --> 00:37:03.724
Arthur, Karshon is looking for
a reason to seize war powers.

512
00:37:03.757 --> 00:37:06.526
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.937
[Aquaman] My place is
out there where I belong,

514
00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:09.463
where I'm actually
good at what I do.

515
00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:11.565
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

516
00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:13.767
I've got to do this.

517
00:37:15.502 --> 00:37:18.939
[Nereus] If anyone finds
out, if you're caught...

518
00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:21.207
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

519
00:37:22.776 --> 00:37:25.712
Then help me not get caught.

And here's a special
outfit for you.

527
00:37:44.898 --> 00:37:46.466
What is that,
boy's extra medium?

528
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.768
It's supposed to be tight.

529
00:37:47.801 --> 00:37:49.436
The chromatophores change color

530
00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:50.880
<i>and camouflage you
for up to a minute,</i>

531
00:37:50.904 --> 00:37:53.607

[Aquaman] What are
we doing for comms?

534
00:37:59.345 --> 00:38:01.347
Open comms are too risky.

535
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.451
I'll be sending a cephalopod
with you to act as a messenger.

536
00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:07.721
That's an octopus.

Just try and lay low when
we get in there, okay?

544
00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:30.410
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

545
00:38:30.444 --> 00:38:32.579

like warm chum butter.

560
00:39:07.914 --> 00:39:09.381
you tell him that I love him.

561
00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:13.954
You tell him that I
think of him every day.

562
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:15.856
I will.

563
00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:17.591
[Nereus] Look, I

Once you've broken Orm out,

I'm bad with geology.

It's undignified
for a king to jest.

Oh, excuse me, Your
Highness, if I use comedy

You know, if the pressures of

683
00:47:37.056 --> 00:47:38.925
perhaps you should leave

684

what they're doing be king.

David Kane that I
knew was ruthless,

All I did was figure
out how it worked.

702
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.541
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

703
00:49:34.575 --> 00:49:37.143
Yeah, well, what can I say?

704
00:49:37.176 --> 00:49:39.078
Things don't always
go as planned.

705
00:49:39.112 --> 00:49:40.312
But that's what I'm afraid of.

706
00:49:42.215 --> 00:49:46.919
David, this stuff could
reshape the entire planet.

707
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.858
Hey, doc.

708
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:59.660
We are this close to unlocking the
greatest power in human history.

709
00:50:01.067 --> 00:50:04.070
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

710
00:50:08.107 --> 00:50:09.942
If I said yes, would you let me?

711
00:50:12.245 --> 00:50:13.312
Sure.

It's an impressive shithole.

How have I never heard
of this place before?

729
00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:21.380
It is not meant to
be common knowledge.

730
00:51:21.415 --> 00:51:22.416
It's a pirate haven.

731
00:51:23.484 --> 00:51:24.484
Pirates?

732
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.730
Listen, I don't know if
you know this about me,

733
00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:30.156

popular with pirates.

Oh, I'm well aware.

736

Relax. It was the only
way to get us both in.

[roaring]

738
00:51:54.146 --> 00:51:55.692
You could've at least
given me a heads up.

739
00:51:55.716 --> 00:51:57.149
Would you have
gone along with it?

740
00:51:57.183 --> 00:51:59.285
- Hell, no.
- Then put a hook in it.

There. That's Kingfish.

748
00:52:33.687 --> 00:52:35.789
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

749
00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:39.426
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

750
00:52:39.459 --> 00:52:41.327
Cool.

751
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.496
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

00:52:42.529 --> 00:52:45.231
Just let me handle this.

753
00:52:45.264 --> 00:52:47.099
He's our best shot
at finding Manta,

754

anything if you go in there

You're so lucky we didn't grow
up together, little brother.

Do not call me "brother."

[Kingfish] Well...

759
00:53:01.648 --> 00:53:05.886
This is a bit of a
surprise, isn't it?

760
00:53:05.919 --> 00:53:09.288
I didn't realize you'd
been released from prison.

761
00:53:09.322 --> 00:53:12.358
It is a recent development.

762
00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:16.195
Outlaws, aren't we all?

763
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.633
We need to find David Kane.

764
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:22.603
Bad news, I'm afraid.

765
00:53:22.636 --> 00:53:26.305
David Kane is no
longer on the market.

766

Not for sale at any price.

767
00:53:29.375 --> 00:53:33.814
He's solely running as
an independent operator.

768
00:53:33.847 --> 00:53:35.849
Where is he holed up now?

769
00:53:39.486 --> 00:53:41.822
In exchange, I offer a favor...

770

play footsie with someone

773

blood on their hands?

774
00:53:52.566 --> 00:53:54.935
I don't have hands!

775

Listen, if the information
checks out good,

779
00:54:06.379 --> 00:54:09.483
I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

780
00:54:09.516 --> 00:54:10.851
and tear this place apart.

781
00:54:12.786 --> 00:54:15.689
That's too bad.

782
00:54:15.722 --> 00:54:17.858
Traditionally, the
kings of Atlantis

783
00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:22.529
have turned a blind eye
to the Sunken Citadel.

784

blind it for you.

a jungle there now.

880
01:00:38.204 --> 01:00:39.272
[Orm panting]

881
01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:40.540
[Aquaman] Faster!

882
01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:49.049
What the hell are you doing?

883
01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:50.717
I don't know. I'm
not used to running.

884
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.152
Just do what I do.

885
01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:53.865
Use your arms, use your
legs. Lift them up.

886
01:00:54.154 --> 01:00:55.155
Like this?

887
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.691
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

888
01:00:58.725 --> 01:00:59.993
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

889
01:01:00.693 --> 01:01:01.795
[yelling]

890
01:01:04.397 --> 01:01:05.999
- [chomps]
- [shrieking]

891
01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:28.188
- [yelping]
- Whoa!

892
01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:30.256
[both panting]

893
01:01:32.392 --> 01:01:34.194
[Orm] We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

894
01:01:34.227 --> 01:01:36.129
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

895
01:01:36.162 --> 01:01:39.099
What do you wanna do, stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

896
01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.901
[growls] What is that?
What does that say?

897
01:01:41.935 --> 01:01:43.379
[Orm] The writing is
ancient Atlantean.

898
01:01:43.403 --> 01:01:46.606
"A true king builds bridges."

899
01:01:51.077 --> 01:01:52.712
- [Orm] What are you doing?
- [whoops]

900
01:01:52.745 --> 01:01:54.180
[grunting]

901
01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:56.015
[groans]

902
01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:59.719
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

903
01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:02.689
- [groaning weakly]
- [stone crumbling]

904
01:02:26.846 --> 01:02:29.716
[grunts] See? A true
king builds bridges.

905
01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:31.050
[laughs]

906
01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.785
[giant bugs chittering]

907
01:02:32.819 --> 01:02:34.721
That's a metaphor!

908
01:02:34.754 --> 01:02:36.856
[Aquaman] Hey! I
forgot to tell you.

909
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.191
Mom says she loves you.

910
01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:40.326
She thinks about
you all the time.

911
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.695
[Orm] Why the hell are
you telling me this now?

912
01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:45.107
[Aquaman] I don't know. I'm just
tired of waiting for the right moment.

913
01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:47.333
- [screeching, chittering]
- [yelps]

914
01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:51.971
[both yelling]

915
01:02:52.005 --> 01:02:53.006
Come on.

916
01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:57.411
[both grunting]

917
01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:10.356
[screeching]

918
01:03:13.893 --> 01:03:16.162
[distant rumbling]

919
01:03:19.098 --> 01:03:21.067
- [deep thuds]
- [exhales]

920
01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.236
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

921
01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:33.279
[rhythmic thumping]

922
01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:34.914
Uh, David? I just
ran more tests,

923
01:03:34.948 --> 01:03:36.483
and this data is
really disturbing.

924
01:03:36.517 --> 01:03:39.719
We have to stop burning
the... orichalcum.

925
01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:43.022
David?

926
01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:49.896
[softly] Oh.

927
01:04:25.965 --> 01:04:28.234
[screaming]

928
01:04:39.413 --> 01:04:43.216
[shrieks and growls]

929
01:04:43.249 --> 01:04:45.251
[yells]

930
01:04:46.587 --> 01:04:47.954
[gasping]

931
01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:57.230
Okay, doc, you want to
know my plan so bad.

932
01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:00.534
Here it is.

933
01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:05.472
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and
destroy everything he holds dear.

934
01:05:05.506 --> 01:05:10.810
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

935
01:05:11.944 --> 01:05:16.316
I will avenge my father.

936
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:19.352
Even if I have to make a
deal with the devil to do it.

937
01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:23.256
David, you can't
trust the trident.

938
01:05:25.258 --> 01:05:28.328
- [knife rasping]
- [yelps]

939
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:34.000
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

940
01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:35.401
[shudders]

941
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.339
Pray I never show
it to you again.

942
01:05:40.674 --> 01:05:42.576
[breathing shakily]

943
01:05:42.609 --> 01:05:44.611
[gasps]

944
01:05:48.449 --> 01:05:50.917
[door bangs open]

945
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.288
[door closes]

946
01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:06.467
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

947
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.968
[Orm] We should wait for
Atlantis to receive your message.

948
01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:11.037
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

949
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.516
[Aquaman] Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm
not asking for your advice on this.

950
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.476
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

951
01:06:15.509 --> 01:06:17.977
So you can go on back to
Azkaban for all I care.

952
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.912
[Orm] So, what's your plan?

953
01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:21.624
[Aquaman] I don't have one,
yet. But he came after my wife,

954
01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.317
which means I'm gonna pull
his tongue out of his butt.

955
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:27.086
Arthur, you are the king. You
cannot let this get personal.

956
01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.666
This coming from the guy who turned
the entire nation of Atlantis

957
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:31.391
into his own private ego trip?

958
01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:33.059
My ego?

959
01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:34.437
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

960
01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:36.262
and challenged my
claim for the throne.

961
01:06:36.295 --> 01:06:38.140
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

962
01:06:38.164 --> 01:06:41.134
If you weren't such an
asshole, you'd still be king.

963
01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:42.536
Unbelievable.

964
01:06:42.569 --> 01:06:44.203
Wait, wait! Wait!

965
01:06:44.237 --> 01:06:46.172
You took my throne and
you don't even want it?

966
01:06:46.205 --> 01:06:48.941
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

967
01:06:48.975 --> 01:06:51.721
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

968
01:06:51.745 --> 01:06:53.480
And I might even be
screwing that up.

969
01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:54.724
You really had no
ambition for it?

970
01:06:54.748 --> 01:06:56.483
Absolutely not.

971
01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:58.552
From the day my father
found out you existed,

972
01:06:58.585 --> 01:07:00.362
he prepared me for the
moment that you would come

973
01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:01.598
and challenge me for the throne.

974
01:07:01.622 --> 01:07:03.322
Wow, that's really sad.

975
01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:04.701
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

976
01:07:04.725 --> 01:07:07.226
with basically no
prep time whatsoever.

977
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.395
[smacks lips] Roasted.

978
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.164
That is not how it happened.

979
01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.008
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

980
01:07:13.032 --> 01:07:14.967
[Aquaman] No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

981
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:16.746
[Orm] Nope. She made the little
water tornado. I fell in it.

982
01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.490
[Aquaman] Okay, shut
up. I think we're here.

983
01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:23.142
- [Aquaman mimics bird call]
- [gasps]

984
01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:25.679
[grunting]

985
01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:28.549
Sleep, <i>aloha.</i>

986
01:07:28.582 --> 01:07:30.049
[Orm] Come on, let's do this.

987
01:07:30.082 --> 01:07:31.418
[Aquaman] Once
this is over with,

988
01:07:31.452 --> 01:07:33.019
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

989
01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:34.597
- [Orm] Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

990
01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:36.289
[Orm] I don't even
know those words.

991
01:07:41.227 --> 01:07:43.262
[deep, rhythmic thudding]

992
01:07:43.296 --> 01:07:45.998
[men shouting in distance]

993
01:07:46.032 --> 01:07:47.701
[Aquaman mimics bird call]

994
01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:49.101
- Huh?
- Shh!

995
01:07:49.135 --> 01:07:51.337
[man grunts, groans]

996
01:08:03.382 --> 01:08:04.451
Hey!

997
01:08:04.485 --> 01:08:06.553
- [helmet clangs]
- [groaning]

998
01:08:28.307 --> 01:08:30.009
[heavy groan]

999
01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.147
- [grunting]
- [yells]

1000
01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:40.019
Whoa, brother.

1001
01:08:43.155 --> 01:08:44.223
<i>Sasa!</i>

1002
01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:52.164
It's an orichalcum furnace.

1003
01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:55.067
All that stolen orichalcum.

1004
01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:56.670
They're just burning it up.

1005
01:08:56.703 --> 01:08:59.105
[Aquaman] He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

1006
01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:00.707
[Orm] This is catastrophic.

1007
01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:03.242
This whole place must be
heat-shielded to protect it

1008
01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:05.546
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

1009
01:09:05.579 --> 01:09:07.179
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

1010
01:09:07.213 --> 01:09:08.582
To take out this reactor,

1011
01:09:08.615 --> 01:09:10.316
we would have to crater
the entire island.

1012
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:14.186
Get away from there! Now!

1013
01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.391
This blaster may be ancient, but it
was built for killing Atlanteans.

1014
01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:27.099
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

1015
01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:29.813
I just didn't want you to break me
in half before I could surrender.

1016
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.439
Please take me with you.

1017
01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:36.643
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

1018
01:09:36.677 --> 01:09:38.745
No, no. Wait, please.

1019
01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.547
I didn't want any of this.

1020
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:43.650
All I wanted was to see
Atlantis with my own eyes.

1021
01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.786
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

1022
01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:50.122
I'm a scientist, and I just
wanted to be taken seriously.

1023
01:09:50.156 --> 01:09:51.491
David Kane said
he could help me,

1024
01:09:51.525 --> 01:09:53.359
but now he won't let me leave.

1025
01:09:53.392 --> 01:09:56.329
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

1026
01:09:57.363 --> 01:09:58.832
I know.

1027
01:09:58.865 --> 01:10:01.167
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

1028
01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.604
But he would've
killed me if I hadn't.

1029
01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:05.672
[scoffs] Knock him out.

1030
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.408
No.

1031
01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:10.242
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

1032
01:10:11.411 --> 01:10:13.145
- What?
- No.

1033
01:10:13.179 --> 01:10:15.549
[grunting] Fine!

1034
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.751
You can come with us.

1035
01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:19.820
Oh... thank you.

1036
01:10:19.853 --> 01:10:22.656
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one <i>sasa!</i>

1037
01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:24.156
Okay, okay.

1038
01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:25.525
It's the black trident.

1039
01:10:25.559 --> 01:10:27.694
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

1040
01:10:27.728 --> 01:10:29.429
It gives Kane great
powers and in return...

1041
01:10:29.463 --> 01:10:33.600
- [yells]
- [glass tinkling]

1042
01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:41.140
[grunting loudly]

01:10:42.341 --> 01:10:44.511
[coughing]

1044
01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:49.315
I hate when that happens.

1045
01:10:49.348 --> 01:10:52.819
[suit sizzling]

1046
01:10:52.853 --> 01:10:55.656
[alarm blaring]

1047
01:11:02.228 --> 01:11:03.563
Stop them!

1048
01:11:03.597 --> 01:11:06.600
[speaking Portuguese]

1049
01:11:13.807 --> 01:11:16.610

1119
01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:34.211
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

1120
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.478
[Nereus] Atlantis does not
command the armies of Xebel. I do.

1121
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:38.978
[Brine King] And
the Brine Kingdom

1122
01:19:39.012 --> 01:19:41.080

its debt to you.

1123
01:19:41.114 --> 01:19:43.349
You may count on us always.

1124
01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:45.486
Something happened to me.

1125
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:48.254
When I touched
that black trident.

1126
01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:50.457
Why is he even here?

1127
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:52.258
He should be on his
way back to prison.

1128
01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:54.060
We should hear
what he has to say.

1129
01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.962
I made that mistake once.

1130
01:19:55.995 --> 01:19:58.198
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

1131
01:19:58.231 --> 01:20:01.468
And he cut off my claw.

1132
01:20:01.502 --> 01:20:04.137
This thing took a whole
year to grow back.

1133
01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.739
Look, he wants to stop
Manta same as we do.

1134
01:20:06.773 --> 01:20:08.341
And just for the record,

1135
01:20:08.374 --> 01:20:10.494
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

1136
01:20:12.912 --> 01:20:14.214
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

1137
01:20:15.215 --> 01:20:18.151
[waves crashing]

1138
01:20:18.184 --> 01:20:20.887
Mom, I don't know
enough about this.

1139
01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.922
Is that even possible?

1140
01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:25.892
All anyone knows for sure is
there once was a seventh kingdom

1141
01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:28.962
and then one day,
just before the fall,

1142
01:20:28.995 --> 01:20:32.065
every record of it was
stricken from the chronicles.

1143
01:20:32.098 --> 01:20:34.834
How do you know what you
saw was the Lost Kingdom?

1144
01:20:34.867 --> 01:20:37.870
No one even knows what
it was called anymore.

1145
01:20:37.904 --> 01:20:39.272
It's called Necrus.

1146
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.975
And I didn't just see it.

1147
01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:44.277
I knew it.

1148
01:20:45.912 --> 01:20:49.215
It's almost like I
was... remembering it.

1149
01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:54.120
Flashes of someone
else's memories.

1150
01:20:55.054 --> 01:20:56.889
During King Atlan's time,

1151
01:20:56.923 --> 01:21:01.160
there were seven united
kingdoms of Atlantis.

1152
01:21:01.194 --> 01:21:05.064
And the Black City was
a curse upon them all.

1153
01:21:11.938 --> 01:21:13.840
<i>By exploiting orichalcum,</i>

1154
01:21:13.873 --> 01:21:17.076

superpower unlike any other.</i>

1155
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:18.978
But it came at a terrible price.

1162

<i>However, Kordax resented Atlan,</i>

1163
01:21:39.466 --> 01:21:42.335
<i>thinking his own brother was
trying to steal his power.</i>

1164
01:21:42.368 --> 01:21:47.840
<i>So, he resorted to dark magic and
crafted an instrument of evil.</i>

1165
01:21:47.874 --> 01:21:49.208
<i>That black trident.</i>

[Mera] But even with
the ice cap melting,

1186
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.486
Kordax still can't be freed.

1187
01:23:05.519 --> 01:23:08.187
Atlan used blood magic to
seal Kordax in his prison.

1188
01:23:08.221 --> 01:23:10.156
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

1189

Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

1190

Manta needs Atlan's blood.

1191
01:23:15.194 --> 01:23:17.230
Blood magic isn't
really magic, it's DNA.

1192
01:23:17.263 --> 01:23:22.436
The key to Kordax's prison is
the royal bloodline itself.

1193
01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:25.938
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

No!

1226
01:25:01.602 --> 01:25:03.402
[screaming]

1227
01:25:03.437 --> 01:25:05.439
[screams echoes and fades]

1228
01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.207
[Arthur Jr. crying]

1229
01:25:18.519 --> 01:25:20.587
[crying continues]

1230
01:25:43.242 --> 01:25:45.779
[keyboard clacking]

1231
01:25:56.657 --> 01:25:58.725
[man] The medics have
stabilized his condition.

1232
01:25:58.759 --> 01:26:00.460
He will be okay.

1233
01:26:00.494 --> 01:26:02.161
[Nereus] We just
picked up a signal.

1234
01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:04.096
It's faint,

1235
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.600
but it's broadcasting on an
old Atlantean sonar frequency.

1236
01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:08.401
Headed to Antarctica.

1237
01:26:09.636 --> 01:26:11.838
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

1238
01:26:13.774 --> 01:26:16.208
I've dreamed of this.

1239
01:26:16.242 --> 01:26:18.645
The two of you standing
together as brothers.

1240
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.583
[shaky sigh]

1241
01:26:22.616 --> 01:26:24.651
Promise me you will
protect each other.

1242
01:26:28.154 --> 01:26:29.823
Promise me, Orm.

1243
01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:44.805
Go.

1244
01:27:01.855 --> 01:27:04.357
[kisses]

1245
01:27:11.297 --> 01:27:13.834
[Brine King] Great
waves, Nereus.

1246
01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:18.438
Your warship is powerful, but
it's slower than a sea cow.

1247
01:27:18.472 --> 01:27:23.342
I say we ditch all this dead
weight and travel light. Hmm?

1248
01:27:23.376 --> 01:27:25.755
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

1249
01:27:25.779 --> 01:27:27.681
Our only chance is to hit him

1250
01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:30.417
with total overwhelming
force from every direction.

1251
01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:32.419
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

1252
01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:33.754
What choice do we have?

1253
01:27:33.787 --> 01:27:35.555
We have no defense
against that cannon.

1254
01:27:35.589 --> 01:27:36.923
Well, wait a minute.

1255
01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:38.725
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

1256
01:27:38.759 --> 01:27:40.827
that messes with our
nervous system, right?

1257
01:27:40.861 --> 01:27:43.830
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

1258
01:27:43.864 --> 01:27:45.499
Well, what if we
disrupt those echoes

1259
01:27:45.532 --> 01:27:47.400
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

1260
01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:49.536
but just much, much louder?

1261
01:27:49.569 --> 01:27:52.238
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

1262
01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:53.671
Well, that's gonna
be the easy part.

1263
01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:56.677
Take your weapons.

1264
01:27:58.277 --> 01:27:59.579
And ready your steeds.

1265
01:28:08.722 --> 01:28:09.990
[Brine King] Hmm.

1266
01:28:10.023 --> 01:28:11.758
[gun clanking]

1267
01:28:20.266 --> 01:28:22.301
Really doesn't
like you, does he?

1268
01:28:22.334 --> 01:28:23.503
[laughs]

1269
01:28:27.574 --> 01:28:29.543
[Storm whinnying]

1270
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.836
[David] We made a
lot of progress, doc.

1271
01:28:55.869 --> 01:28:58.270
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

1272
01:28:58.304 --> 01:28:59.773
but we were damn close.

1273
01:28:59.806 --> 01:29:02.274
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

1274
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:04.978
[breath shaking]

1275
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:07.547
My God, what did we do?

1276
01:29:07.581 --> 01:29:10.316
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

1277
01:29:10.349 --> 01:29:12.919
All we did was fast
forward things a few years.

1278
01:29:12.953 --> 01:29:14.564
[Stingray] The ice
hasn't fully melted yet,

1279
01:29:14.588 --> 01:29:16.523
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

1280
01:29:17.424 --> 01:29:18.725
Here.

1281
01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:20.927
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

1282
01:29:22.829 --> 01:29:24.498
Power up the sonic cannon.

1283
01:29:26.032 --> 01:29:27.501
Bag the child and suit up.

1284
01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:43.382

- Yah!
- [Storm bellows]

1288
01:29:57.597 --> 01:29:59.757
[Stingray] Captain, we have
multiple incoming hostiles.

1289
01:30:01.601 --> 01:30:02.736
[David] You're too late.

1290
01:30:12.612 --> 01:30:13.612
No.

1291
01:30:17.617 --> 01:30:19.619
[waves splashing]

1292
01:30:21.454 --> 01:30:23.322

[sonar pinging]

1294
01:30:39.506 --> 01:30:41.141

[whale song pulsating]

1299
01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:34.928
You've got to be kidding me.

1300
01:31:34.961 --> 01:31:37.063
[pulsating whale

1301

[metal creaking]

1304
01:32:10.864 --> 01:32:12.132
Astounding.

1305
01:32:18.238 --> 01:32:21.474
[dark chorus singing]

1306
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.777
[Nereus] This place is
immense. It could be anywhere.

1307
01:32:57.811 --> 01:33:00.146
[Orm] The throne of Necrus
is in the heart of the city.

1308
01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.657
[Mera] I sense
something in the water.

1309
01:33:01.681 --> 01:33:02.921
[Nereus] Everyone, light it up.

1310
01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:12.625
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

1311
01:33:12.659 --> 01:33:14.294
Yes. I did.

1312
01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:16.596
[Aquaman] Keep your eyes open.

1313
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:19.632
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

1314
01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:22.235
[Nereus] Everyone stand
ready. Something's coming.

1320
01:33:46.059 --> 01:33:47.336
[Nereus] I think this
goes all the way through.

1321
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.563
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

1322
01:33:50.597 --> 01:33:53.299
Go now and save the prince.

1323
01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:54.834
Thank you, Your Highness.

1324

[Kordax] Well, now this is
certainly an improvement.

Powerful, Atlantean body.

1409
01:41:20.481 --> 01:41:23.784
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

1410
01:41:23.817 --> 01:41:25.294
It's not true. Come
on, little brother.

I know you're in
there. [grunts]

[Kordax] Don't you
see? You can't win.

1413
01:41:29.255 --> 01:41:32.526
Either you kill your
brother or you die.

[both screaming]

1426
01:42:25.144 --> 01:42:26.154
- Give it to me!
- [Orm] No!

1427
01:42:26.178 --> 01:42:27.748
I can end this.

1428
01:42:27.781 --> 01:42:31.284
Don't let him take it! Hasn't
he taken enough already?

1429
01:42:32.819 --> 01:42:34.287
Yield the throne.

1430
01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:37.724
It's time for me to
reclaim my destiny.

1431
01:42:37.758 --> 01:42:40.661
It would be foolish to
think he could ever change.

1432
01:42:40.694 --> 01:42:42.596
I knew you would do this.

1433
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:44.498
You are the one true king.

1434
01:42:44.531 --> 01:42:48.100
Atlantis deserves
its one true king.

you more than anything.

Let you know that
you weren't alone,

Come on, little brother,

I meant what I said
when I first met you.

No matter what,
you are not alone.

1447

Let go.

I have waited countless
centuries in the dark

1458
01:44:34.474 --> 01:44:35.642
Shit.

01:44:43.382 --> 01:44:44.584

[Brine King grunts] Bah!

1502
01:48:21.768 --> 01:48:24.004
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

1503
01:48:25.538 --> 01:48:27.406
Not everybody's gonna
see it that way though.

1504
01:48:32.112 --> 01:48:34.681
It's too bad you went and had
yourself killed back there.

[Mera] Yes.

1506
01:48:37.817 --> 01:48:38.985
All this ice.

1507
01:48:40.654 --> 01:48:42.756
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

1508
01:48:44.591 --> 01:48:45.835
[Aquaman] Just lay
low for a while.

1509
01:48:45.859 --> 01:48:48.161
But don't go too far.

1510
01:48:48.194 --> 01:48:50.096
I may need to call you
up for some advice.

1511

You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

[resounding clang]

1516

You're not as bad at
this as you think.

1517
01:49:22.762 --> 01:49:25.565
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

1518
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.868
You are everything I was not.

1519
01:49:28.902 --> 01:49:31.671
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

1520
01:49:32.973 --> 01:49:34.574
And you're willing
to ask for help

1521
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:37.043
even from your worst enemy.

1522
01:49:39.112 --> 01:49:40.714
I know it may not feel like

1523
01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:42.291
you know what you're
doing sometimes, but...

1524
01:49:42.315 --> 01:49:44.918
keep trusting your instincts.

1525
01:49:44.951 --> 01:49:47.821
If you lead,
Atlantis will follow.

1526
01:49:51.157 --> 01:49:54.594
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

1527
01:49:55.862 --> 01:49:57.222
I thought that was
just a metaphor.

1528
01:50:00.133 --> 01:50:04.971
Well, your metaphor might have
just saved the world's ass.
