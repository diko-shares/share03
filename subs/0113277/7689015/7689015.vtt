00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.171
Stabilize. Okay, here.
Where's the portable X-ray?

2
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.918
Check, charge, or cash?

3
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:37.883
Cash and, uh... make it out
to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

4
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.512
788.30.

5
00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:50.438
Okay.

7
00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.027
Oh, God.

8
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.331
Hey. Taking me to breakfast?

9
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.875
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

10
00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.211
Hey, Vincent.

11
00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.004
Mom, where are my barrettes?

12
00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:41.008
- Hi, sweetie.
- I saw them on the kitchen table.

13
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.926
- They're not there. I already checked.
- Want me to make coffee?

14
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.387
- No school today?
- My dad's picking me up.

15
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.722
He's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

16
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.556
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

17
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.897
He's already a half an hour late.

18
00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.317
He gonna show, or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:03.071
- I'll make coffee.
- I'm out of time, baby.

20
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.253
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not on the couch.

21
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.840
- Oh, wear the blue ones.
- I don't want to wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.593
- They don't match.
- Did you check in your bathroom?

23
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.261
I checked everywhere.

24
00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.804
Well, what do you want me to do?

25
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.265
Find them! Mom, pay attention!

26
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.143
- All right, sweetie. All right. What?
- Daddy's going to be here!

27
00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.247
- Well, okay. He's going to be...
- I'm not gonna be ready!

28
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.354
I can't be late.

29
00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.565
- You won't be late.
- No, I will be late!

30
00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.776
Okay, listen, before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

31
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.945
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

32
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.989
It's all right. It's all right.

33
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:51.160
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together. Just relax.

34
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.706
He won't come before we find them.
I promise you.

35
00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:06.676
Hey, give me another refill.

36
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.939
What's your name?

37
00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.566
Waingro.

38
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.451
You're Michael, huh?

39
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.633
Do you guys always work together?

40
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:48.926
All the time.

41
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.553
Real tight crew, huh?

42
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:51.638
Real tight.

43
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.600
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.228
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.323
How's he doing?

46
00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.661
100%. Right on schedule.

47
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.121
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

48
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.083
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

49
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.460
Okay.

00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.383
<i>102.7 KIIS FM!</i>

51
00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.109
Just crossed over the number-one lane.

52
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.486
- 300 yards from you now.
- Get set.

53
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.780
I am.

54
00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:01.666
Here we go.

55
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:05.229
211! 211! We're being held up!

56
00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.404
<i>211 alarm. Armored car.</i>

57
00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.364
There's the call. Three minutes.

58
00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.201
Clear!

59
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.058
Eighty seconds left!

60
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:29.522
Get back. Get back! Get back!

61
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.151
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

62
00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.779
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

63
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.919
I got it. I got it.

64
00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.299
Yeah, don't fuck with me.

65
00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.093
You want to fuck with me?

66
00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:25.953
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

67
00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.887
- What did you do? Let's go!
- That guy was making a move.

68
00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:38.591
Dumb motherfucker!

69
00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.623
- Step out here please, sir.
- I heard them.

70
00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.606
A million six.

71
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:39.276
Forty cents on the dollar,
640,000 to you.

72
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.362
150 front money.

73
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.240
Get you the rest two, three days.

74
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.951
Know who owned these?

75
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.082
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

76
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:57.419
Roger Van Zant.
Owns banks in the Caymans.

77
00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.965
Runs investment portfolios for
offshore drug money, stuff like that.

78
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.468
- So?
- So, you ripped off his bearer bonds.

79
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.678
He's got insurance.

80
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.973
That's the point.
He collects 100% from the insurance.

81
00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:13.977
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60% of their value,

82
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:16.564
make 40% on top of the 100%.

83
00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:20.807
Sell it back to him instead of
going through the street,

84
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.696
- that's an extra 320,000 to you.
- Try it on him.

85
00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.324
- Kelso called.
- About what?

86
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:29.808
A score he's putting out
he wants you to look at.

87
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.704
Why do I need his score for?
I got my own.

88
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.999
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

89
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.833
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

90
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:38.169
What happened out there?

91
00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.921
Don't ask.

92
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.042
- Find the ambulance?
- Dumped it four blocks from here.

93
00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.462
22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.
They torched it.

94
00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:25.046
Burned everything...
The guns, clothes, everything.

95
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.218
They were airborne.

96
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:32.202
They taped the last few seconds of the
black-and-whites doing demolition derby.

97
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.184
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.

98
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:39.563
The yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
day before yesterday.

99
00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:43.192
You taking this one, Lieutenant?
Or does it stay in division?

100
00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:48.071
This look like gangbangers
working the local 7-Eleven to you?

101
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:50.073
Robbery-Homicide's taking it, yeah.

102
00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:52.034
- All yours.
- We got three motorists.

103
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.786
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

104
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.581
Console TV man over there,
however, he was closer.

105
00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.459
He ID anybody?

106
00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.837
Well, he was hiding.
He heard it, mostly.

107
00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.549
Okay, what about them?

108
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.969
All right, now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

109
00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:12.054
Smart.

110
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.973
- Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."
- Slick?

111
00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.184
Yeah. Now this guy... I figure this guy

112
00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:21.146
went for that holdout piece,
ankle holster, right?

113
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.442
From here, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

114
00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:27.319
This side.

115
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:32.574
This guy here got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

116
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.410
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

117
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.912
Probably executed.

118
00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:41.416
And it was a million six in bearer bonds.

119
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.126
And they ignored the loose cash.

120
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:46.088
'Cause they had no time,
'cause they were on a clock,

121
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.132
which means they knew
our response time to a 211,

122
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:52.344
had our air, immobilized it, entered,

123
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.013
escaped in under three minutes.

124
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:57.849
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

125
00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:01.269
Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.

126
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.437
Traffic video camera?

127
00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.606
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

128
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.358
You recognize the MO?

129
00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.361
MO is that they're good.

130
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.364
Once it escalated into a murder 1-B
for all of them,

131
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.200
after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate.

132
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:19.704
Popped guard number three,
because what difference does it make?

133
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:21.414
Why leave a living witness?

134
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.877
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock and roll.

135
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.339
The shaped charge.

136
00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:33.385
The shaped charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

137
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.069
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

138
00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:39.099
Let's start looking for recent high-line
burglaries that have mystified us.

139
00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.601
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

140
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.979
You're gonna get the phone book.
Do it anyway.

141
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.273
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

142
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.694
Check the usual fences. You and I
will check Cuzomano and Torena.

143
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.280
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

144
00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:57.576
Hang in with forensics. From
the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

145
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.579
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

146
00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:04.583
Get your hand out of
that man's pocket, Rachel.

147
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:05.668
Hello, Vincent.

148
00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.426
Y'all want some pie?

149
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:25.813
Got to go to the john.

150
00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.094
Look, I had to get it on, man.

151
00:18:58.178 --> 00:19:00.764
He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

152
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.899
Damn it! God...

153
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.237
Split's in the car.

154
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.323
I took out of ours evenly

155
00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.367
to make up for his full end,

156
00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:25.789
because I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

157
00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.662
Hold it!

158
00:21:41.258 --> 00:21:42.342
Hey.

159
00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:47.847
- Where's the rest?
- We're late.

160
00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:49.432
You look too good to go out.

161
00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.518
I could just jump you right here.

162
00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:58.066
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

163
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.486
There's more in a couple days, so don't
sweat it. Come on. We really are late.

164
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.156
Yeah? Come on. You gotta be kidding me.

165
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:09.285
Honey, it ain't worth
the risks you take for 8,000.

166
00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:12.163
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

167
00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:14.666
Let's go. Get your coat.

168
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.606
There is no point talking to you because
all you are is a child growing older.

169
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.047
What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:23.675
It means we're not making
forward progress

171
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.927
like real, grown-up adults
living our lives.

172
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.513
Because I'm married
to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

173
00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.247
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

174
00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:34.519
What am I doing
in this rat-bastard situation?

175
00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:36.438
You're not. What do you want from me?

176
00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:39.607
Leave the bankbook and the car keys
in the kitchen on your way out the door.

177
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.943
- Now, are we going or...
- You can keep that other crap,

178
00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.779
but Dominick would go with me.

179
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.533
Don't you even think about...

180
00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:14.601
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

181
00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:19.147
- Albert Torena call Vincent?
- No.

182
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.608
No. Report came in.

183
00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:24.944
The explosive was Dy-Ex, a linear-shaped
charge used in demolition.

184
00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:29.199
You can pick it up with a driver's
license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

185
00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:31.034
Too common to trace the sale, Vincent.

186
00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:32.995
Oh, that's wonderful.

187
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.141
Are you all right?

188
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.393
What happened? Where have you been?

189
00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:58.687
Work.

190
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.565
Lauren's dad show up?

191
00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:05.527
Didn't call. Didn't show.

192
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:07.487
We waited for you till 10:30.

193
00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:13.285
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

194
00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:16.371
I don't know.

195
00:24:17.372 --> 00:24:18.874
Fucking jerk.

196
00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:21.877
Well, is she okay?

197
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:26.631
She's been in her room all day,
so no, she's not okay.

198
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.299
Neither am I.

199
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:32.470
Uh, I made dinner for us four hours ago.

200
00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:36.558
Um, every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us,

201
00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:38.393
you withdraw.

202
00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:45.692
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

203
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:50.488
I'm sorry if the goddamn chicken

204
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:53.950
got... overcooked.

205
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.638
<i>Seven men in Denmark
were key defendants here.</i>

206
00:25:17.724 --> 00:25:20.143
- Find it?
- Not yet.

207
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:23.229
- Here it is.
- Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:25.816
- It's by author.
- Over here.

209
00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:34.658
- Interior Design?
- It's on the back wall.

210
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.718
- Coffee, sir?
- Please.

211
00:25:58.306 --> 00:25:59.850
Will you pass the cream?

212
00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.813
- Thanks.
- What did you get?

213
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.107
What?

214
00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.408
What are you reading?

215
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:17.033
Book about metals.

216
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.248
<i>Stress Fractures In Titanium.</i>

217
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:26.334
What kind of work you do?

218
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:32.955
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

219
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:39.472
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

220
00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:40.682
What store?

221
00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.275
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

222
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:49.232
Uh, if you don't want to talk to me,
it's okay. Sorry I bothered you.

223
00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:03.871
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

224
00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.457
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

225
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.834
My name's Neil.

226
00:27:13.173 --> 00:27:15.008
I'm Eady.

227
00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:18.553
You like working there?

228
00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:22.140
Sure.

229
00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:25.601
I get a discount, and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

230
00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:27.812
What area's that?

231
00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.189
Graphic design.

232
00:27:30.273 --> 00:27:33.151
I do, um, letterheads
and logotypes at night,

233
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:36.821
and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

234
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:38.657
Who do you do that for?

235
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.453
Uh, a restaurant.

236
00:27:43.537 --> 00:27:46.498
I did their menus and, um,

237
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:50.877
a small, uh, record label.

238
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:53.045
CDs.

239
00:27:53.129 --> 00:27:55.674
I've done two so far.

240
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.885
Did you go to school for that?

241
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.012
Yeah.

242
00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.055
Yeah, I went to Parsons.

243
00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:05.684
- Oh, where's that?
- New York City.

244
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:08.235
And how long you been out here?

245
00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:10.856
About a year.

246
00:28:11.648 --> 00:28:12.648
Do you like it?

247
00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:15.526
Not really.

248
00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.029
I'm mostly here for the work.

249
00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:26.954
Live in this neighborhood?

250
00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:30.458
Ah, no.
I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

251
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.585
It's actually kind of a...

252
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:35.421
It's a little house that I rent,
and it's kind of rundown,

253
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:38.133
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

254
00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:40.760
What about you?

255
00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:42.303
I live up here.

256
00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:44.139
That's very funny.

257
00:28:48.184 --> 00:28:50.812
So where's your family from originally?

258
00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:54.357
Oh, they're Scots-Irish.

259
00:28:55.483 --> 00:29:00.780
They, um... They emigrated
to Appalachia in the late 1700s.

260
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:03.658
Where are you from?

261
00:29:04.784 --> 00:29:05.994
The Bay Area.

262
00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:08.622
Are your folks there?

263
00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:13.793
No. My mother died a long time ago.

264
00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:16.128
And my father, I don't know where he is.

265
00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.756
Got a brother somewhere.

266
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:26.222
You have a tight family. I can tell.

267
00:29:26.306 --> 00:29:28.182
- Yeah.
- Right?

268
00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.601
You're right.

269
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:41.029
City of Lights.

270
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:47.702
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae

271
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:50.121
that come out once a year in the water.

272
00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.922
That's what it looks like out there.

273
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:55.794
You been there?

274
00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:58.922
No. I'm going there someday.

275
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.882
Oh, yeah?

276
00:30:07.722 --> 00:30:09.182
You travel a lot?

277
00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.019
Yeah.

278
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.355
Traveling makes you lonely?

279
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.739
I'm... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

280
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:25.991
You?

281
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:28.910
Real lonely.

282
00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:35.245
Albert!

283
00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:39.707
- Shit.
- Albert.

284
00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:42.293
Vincent, man, what are you doing
coming here for? You crazy?

285
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.669
This ain't Disneyland, man.

286
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:47.703
You were supposed to get back to me last
night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

287
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:52.428
- I couldn't break free, Vincent.
- Let's violate his ass right now.

288
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:55.389
I do for you. You don't do for me.

289
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:56.599
Is that it?

290
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.727
Vincent, man, I swear,
I was out all night, man.

291
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.271
I'm hitting like one of them
flamenco matador guys.

292
00:33:02.355 --> 00:33:04.356
What's flamenco?
That's got nothing to do with me.

293
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.110
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

294
00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:09.487
I'm a dancer, man. You know?

295
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:13.115
Bullshit. I paged your ass all day.
I can't stand fucking paging.

296
00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:15.868
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

297
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:18.829
Oh, man, where's your empathy, brother?
It's a substance-abuse problem.

298
00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:22.666
Empathy was yesterday. Today,
you're wasting my motherfucking time.

299
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.002
- Vincent, man, look...
- Did you fall in love?

300
00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.630
Come on.
Did you fall in love last night?

301
00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:29.298
- And you went off somewhere?
- Vincent.

302
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.510
Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.
You know what I mean? I'll buy that.

303
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:33.803
V-Vincent.

304
00:33:33.887 --> 00:33:35.638
- Give me all you got!
- Vincent...

305
00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:37.890
Give me all you got!

306
00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:41.227
I swear, man, my brother...
My brother Richard is gonna talk to you.

307
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:43.104
I heard Richard?

308
00:33:43.897 --> 00:33:46.899
- He gonna talk to you.
- Richard? Richard?

309
00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.943
He's gonna meet you, man, I swear.
Tonight!

310
00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:50.152
He's not here, is he?

311
00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:53.614
- No. He gonna meet you tonight.
- Tonight? What happened to right now?

312
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:57.952
I-I-I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

313
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.455
- This is a bunch of bullshit.
- No, I swear. He said no.

314
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.333
- Because he in Phoenix.
- Ah.

315
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:07.128
Listen, I swear, man,
tonight's the best...

316
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.810
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

317
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.389
You know? He'll meet... He'll meet you

318
00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:23.310
at BJ's on Alvarado at 2:00 a.m.

319
00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:26.272
- Be there.
- You be there, too.

320
00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:29.233
Vincent, I can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vince.

321
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:32.167
- I got things to do. I got places to be.
- Hey, hey, hey.

322
00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:34.614
Be there.

323
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.789
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

324
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:48.336
What is it?

325
00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:51.797
It's a bank.

326
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:55.259
It depots cash on Thursday for
distribution to all the other branches

327
00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:57.511
to cover Friday payroll checks.

328
00:34:57.595 --> 00:35:00.931
So, on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

329
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:03.517
- On the prowl or strong?
- Strong. Through the front door.

330
00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.935
How many guys?

331
00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:06.854
Eh, four. Three plus the driver.

332
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.814
You walk in,
you knock them over, you walk out.

333
00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:10.232
And you want 100,000 in advance

334
00:35:10.316 --> 00:35:12.693
- against a 10% cut for that?
- Uh-huh.

335
00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.820
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.

336
00:35:14.904 --> 00:35:18.804
They hit the holdup alarms, I gotta get
out before the cops show. What is that?

337
00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:21.619
They have three holdup alarm systems.

338
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.871
Two telco and a cellular.

339
00:35:25.873 --> 00:35:28.709
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because...

340
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:32.129
See, the night before, you cut in

341
00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:34.798
and trick out the alarm system computer

342
00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:38.636
to turn itself
and the video recorders off

343
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.670
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

344
00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:43.182
Architectural,
electrical engineering plans?

345
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:45.826
I got all that. I got schematics.
I got the boards already built.

346
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:47.603
They go straight into the CPU.

347
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.606
What's the estimate?

348
00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:55.903
12.1, 12.2 million.

349
00:35:59.032 --> 00:36:00.533
You're on.

350
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:04.203
Congratulations.
And to give you a little idea

351
00:36:04.287 --> 00:36:07.164
of where my estimates come from,
this is a printout...

352
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:09.583
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

353
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:13.045
Be that as it may, my way,
you get 100% from the insurance company,

354
00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:15.798
and take the bonds back from us
at 60 cents on the dollar

355
00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:18.217
<i>and make yourself another 40%.</i>

356
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:23.011
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

357
00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.432
Sure. You got a deal.

358
00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.976
Good, because there's no percentage

359
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.311
if everyone gets their underwear
in a twist over this.

360
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:33.148
Yeah. So you have your man call me,
and we'll set the meet.

361
00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:34.692
Yeah, okay.

362
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.527
Nice talking to you.

363
00:36:37.653 --> 00:36:39.363
You gonna deal with these guys?

364
00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:42.324
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

365
00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:45.119
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

366
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:48.453
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

367
00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:56.148
As I was saying, that's not really
an estimate. Those are exact figures.

368
00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:59.341
I have the printout here of the cash
flow of the bank the past two months.

369
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:01.427
How do you get this information?

370
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:04.305
It just comes to you.
This stuff just flies through the air.

371
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:07.391
They send this information out. It's
beamed out all over the fucking place.

372
00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:10.925
All you have to do is know how
to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

373
00:37:16.692 --> 00:37:18.610
Um, okay, here we go.

374
00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:20.279
13.9 million.

375
00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:27.036
- I bought it.
- Good. What did I tell you?

376
00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:31.958
Here.

377
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:36.254
We're on.
Call Van Zant. Collect the money.

378
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.881
How is he?

379
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:40.425
He's a businessman.

380
00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:43.553
Okay.

381
00:38:09.328 --> 00:38:11.246
Avocado.

382
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.791
"A-cah-do."

383
00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:17.462
- Hello.
<i>- Yeah, hello.</i>

384
00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:19.881
Chris is at my place.

385
00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:24.551
What's wrong?

386
00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.679
Husband and wife stuff.

387
00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.896
I'll let him sleep it off here.

388
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:44.739
What happened to you?

389
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.371
- When you gonna get some furniture?
- When I get around to it.

390
00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:57.293
Charlene's gonna leave me.

391
00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:00.630
Why?

392
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.093
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

393
00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.828
With everything we've been doing?

394
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.850
Vegas, the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

395
00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:17.313
- When you gonna get an old lady?
- When I get around to it.

396
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:22.026
You got something else on the side?

397
00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:24.987
Nothing regular.

398
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.073
She got something else on the side?

399
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:29.492
- No.
- You sure?

400
00:39:30.743 --> 00:39:32.286
Yeah, I'm sure.

401
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:35.998
I don't know what you're doing.

402
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.085
Remember Jimmy McElwain
on the yard used to say,

403
00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:42.045
"You want to be making moves
on the street,

404
00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:43.630
have no attachments.

405
00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:47.968
Allow nothing to be in your life you
cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat,

406
00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:50.429
if you spot the heat around the corner."

407
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.098
You remember that?

408
00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:01.857
For me, the sun rises and sets
with her, man.

409
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.277
Yeah?

410
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:06.404
Yeah.

411
00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:10.283
Okay.

412
00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.998
Today, we take delivery
of cash from Van Zant.

413
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.502
Then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

414
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:22.670
Bank? What bank?

415
00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:26.048
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

416
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:28.009
That goes, too. Then the bank.

417
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:34.098
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah.

418
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.856
Are you okay?

419
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.317
Yeah, sugar.

420
00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:52.241
Yeah. For real.

421
00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:53.992
- Okay.
- Going to do good.

422
00:40:54.076 --> 00:40:55.661
I'll see you later.

423
00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:14.471
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.

424
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:17.015
Grierson, my parole officer,
told me to come by here,

425
00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:18.976
said you had a job for me.

426
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.228
So you're familiar
with this kind of operation, huh?

427
00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:24.439
- Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.
- Good. Good for you.

428
00:41:24.523 --> 00:41:27.234
Here, you'll mop out the toilets,
hit the dishwasher, bus tables,

429
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.777
and empty the garbage too.

430
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:30.612
Give me a hard time, I'll report you.

431
00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:31.863
Loaded, drunk, or stealing,

432
00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:34.575
and I will violate you back so fast,
your head will spin.

433
00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:37.202
Twenty-five percent
of your take-home kicks back to me.

434
00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:40.747
Rules of the game.
Call Grierson. Check it out.

435
00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.166
Change in the back.

436
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.680
Well, what are you waiting for?

437
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.236
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

438
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.739
- Yeah. Roger Van Zant.
<i>- Please hold.</i>

439
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:20.203
<i>Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.</i>

440
00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:21.830
I'm supposed to collect something?

441
00:42:21.914 --> 00:42:23.332
Give me your number

442
00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:26.366
and somebody will call you right back
from a different line.

443
00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:29.797
818-133-6089.

444
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:56.198
- Yeah.
<i>- I got a package for you.</i>

445
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:59.201
<i>There's a drive-in on Centinela.
2:30 tomorrow.</i>

446
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.287
Okay, just send one man alone.

447
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:28.980
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

448
00:43:29.064 --> 00:43:30.649
Who the... Who...

449
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.442
- Who was that guy?
- He's nobody.

450
00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:34.528
I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

451
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.196
- He's nobody, Neil.
- Listen, you...

452
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.658
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas, Alan Marciano.

453
00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:42.744
- Chris gonna straighten it up with you.
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!

454
00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:43.913
Shut up!

455
00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:49.042
Here's the deal.
You will give Chris one last shot.

456
00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:53.255
After that, he fucks up, then I will
finance setting you up myself

457
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:55.632
on my own, anywhere you want.

458
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:58.802
Dominick will go with you.
And my word counts.

459
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:03.015
But right now,
you will give him the chance.

460
00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:08.562
Clean up. Go home.

461
00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:10.940
Clean up. Go home.

462
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:58.278
Give me all your money.

463
00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:00.739
One day you gonna get smoked
with that shit.

464
00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:02.074
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

465
00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.329
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

466
00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:10.416
Yeah, got it.

467
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.237
Vincent! Hey, man!

468
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:42.447
Hey! Vincent.

469
00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:45.325
Hey, Vincent, this is my brother
Richard. Richard, Vincent.

470
00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.244
- Richard.
- Yeah. It's all right.

471
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.205
What do you got for me?

472
00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:52.374
Before we even get into that,

473
00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:55.752
there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas.

474
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:58.880
All right? Now, the back
of a trim shop on Irvine,

475
00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:02.509
if somebody was to pay
a little visit this weekend,

476
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:06.513
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 slope.

477
00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:09.307
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

478
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:12.227
Yeah? I'm a good citizen.

479
00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:14.187
I'm Donald Duck.

480
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.321
So, you got something to tell me or what?

481
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:20.193
Check this out, coz.

482
00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:23.989
How do I know, if I tell you
what you need to know,

483
00:46:24.073 --> 00:46:26.783
you're gonna do what the fuck
I need to get done?

484
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:30.620
Richard, man, Hanna's straight up.
We do business all the time.

485
00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:32.956
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

486
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.666
And you know because I say so,

487
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.837
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

488
00:46:38.921 --> 00:46:41.339
Look here, man,
you understand what I'm saying?

489
00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:43.758
I could get killed
for telling you this shit.

490
00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:45.802
You can get killed walking your doggy!

491
00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:47.762
All right, man.

492
00:46:47.846 --> 00:46:50.348
There's this cat
I was locked up with in Folsom.

493
00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:52.559
Did a couple... two, three years.

494
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.687
He got out, and I ran into him.

495
00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.232
And so?

496
00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.693
He's a big fiend for action.

497
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:05.363
Now if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing.

498
00:47:05.447 --> 00:47:07.073
But he goes on and on,

499
00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.242
running down to me
how he ain't been doing nothing

500
00:47:09.326 --> 00:47:12.078
and nothing's been going on
and all this other bullshit.

501
00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:17.626
So right then and there, I know
this cat's got something going down.

502
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:26.719
Pretty fucking great.

503
00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:30.805
Albert, what's wrong with you?

504
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:34.851
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

505
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:38.104
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

506
00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:42.984
- That's right.
- Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

507
00:47:43.068 --> 00:47:45.487
What do you want for that,
a Junior G-Man badge?

508
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.990
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

509
00:47:49.116 --> 00:47:50.325
Is he kidding me?

510
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:55.038
Hey, I'm telling you, man. This Slick
is no motherfucking joke, man.

511
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.882
You know what I'm saying?
He's double time...

512
00:47:56.915 --> 00:48:00.126
Say what? Say what?
You said "Slick." What does that mean?

513
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.255
Slick. That's what
he calls people. "Slick."

514
00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:06.592
And tell me about him.

515
00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:10.553
About six feet tall.

516
00:48:10.637 --> 00:48:12.806
A lot of jailhouse tats.

517
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.184
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

518
00:48:17.144 --> 00:48:19.063
What's his name?

519
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:21.856
Cheritto.

520
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.568
Michael Cheritto.

521
00:48:27.946 --> 00:48:30.657
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976,</i>

522
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.159
<i>11 for armed robbery, three convictions.</i>

523
00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:36.079
<i>Two out of
a three-to-five-year beef in Attica.</i>

524
00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:37.247
Three years in Marion.

525
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:40.792
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

526
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:44.337
<i>- Jacket's two inches thick.</i>
- Okay, who do I have there now?

527
00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.047
Drucker and me, boss, and Schwartz.

528
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:48.008
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

529
00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:51.052
That's 24 hours,
round-the-clock, day and night,

530
00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:52.804
we never close, open seven days a week.

531
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.223
<i>Bug the car, the house, the works.</i>

532
00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:57.142
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant,</i>

533
00:48:57.226 --> 00:48:59.894
<i>I want pictures
of who he moves and sits with.</i>

534
00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:01.438
Then you guys run makes on them.

535
00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:04.107
They got jackets, I want to see
who they move and sit with.

536
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:08.153
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

537
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:04.125
- Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- What?

538
00:50:04.209 --> 00:50:07.378
- Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- All right.

539
00:50:07.462 --> 00:50:10.090
I tell you what to do.
I tell you how to do it.

540
00:50:11.383 --> 00:50:15.137
Now, with your right hand only...
Your right hand only...

541
00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:18.682
Take the package and throw it in here.

542
00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:38.952
Fuck. Behind you on the right.

543
00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:00.658
Yeah. Roger Van Zant.

544
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:01.993
Yeah. Who's this?

545
00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:03.787
You know who this is.

546
00:52:04.871 --> 00:52:06.331
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

547
00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:08.416
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

548
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.627
He didn't call. Is everything all right?

549
00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:14.255
<i>I'll tell you what. Forget the money.</i>

550
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:15.340
What?

551
00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:18.385
Forget the money.

552
00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:21.721
Well, it's a lot of money.

553
00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:24.682
Wh-What are you doing?
What do you mean, forget the money?

554
00:52:24.766 --> 00:52:27.561
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

555
00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:29.438
I don't understand.

556
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.480
Because there is a dead man
on the other end of this fucking line.

557
00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.796
Oh, Michael.

558
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.214
Do you like it?

559
00:52:56.923 --> 00:52:58.216
Wow.

560
00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:04.139
Did you know about this?

561
00:53:05.891 --> 00:53:07.642
You are insane.

562
00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:14.732
- You like it?
- It is beautiful.

563
00:53:14.816 --> 00:53:17.211
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Just don't ask him where he got it.

564
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:20.530
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's what I had thought.

565
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:29.038
What do you want to be
when you grow up, honey?

566
00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:30.165
I don't know.

567
00:53:32.376 --> 00:53:35.211
She doesn't know. Just like me.

568
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.588
I don't know either.

569
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.520
Hello.

570
00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:54.605
Hi. It's me.

571
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:57.776
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

572
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:02.613
I've been busy. Can I see you?

573
00:54:02.697 --> 00:54:04.783
I was afraid that was just

574
00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:07.786
the one night, you know?

575
00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.580
No, not for me it wasn't.

576
00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:14.292
Yeah, me neither.

577
00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.380
Can I fall by?

578
00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:20.381
Yeah.

579
00:54:20.465 --> 00:54:22.717
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

580
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:39.943
Goddamn convention.

581
00:54:40.902 --> 00:54:43.154
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

582
00:54:43.238 --> 00:54:44.572
We got two transmitters.

583
00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:47.784
One's in the wheel well.
Backup's in the fire wall.

584
00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:50.954
- Oh, here we are.
- Did you say good night to Neil?

585
00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:53.915
The one with the blond hair
is Chris Shiherlis.

586
00:54:53.999 --> 00:54:57.502
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

587
00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:03.049
Cheritto has cruised the precious metals
depository three times.

588
00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.510
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

589
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.263
Sammy and I think that's going
to be their next score.

590
00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:10.348
Who's the loner?

591
00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:17.063
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

592
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:20.692
Well, get on it.

593
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:31.369
Okay.

594
00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.962
When these guys walk out the door

595
00:55:41.046 --> 00:55:43.840
of whatever score
they're gonna take next,

596
00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:48.094
they're gonna have
the surprise of a lifetime.

597
00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.862
Hey, baby, time to go.

598
00:56:06.988 --> 00:56:09.657
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

599
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:11.117
Oh, yeah.

600
00:56:12.994 --> 00:56:16.248
You fly. You cool.

601
00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:24.714
You're lying to me.

602
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:27.592
I can always tell when people lie to me.

603
00:56:27.676 --> 00:56:29.886
Hon, I ain't lying.

604
00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.762
You a hot dog,

605
00:56:31.846 --> 00:56:34.515
a regular rodeo rider,

606
00:56:34.599 --> 00:56:38.061
and this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

607
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:45.067
Now I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

608
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:47.236
You don't have a truth-telling style.

609
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.155
What are you talking about?

610
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.283
You don't know what this is.

611
00:56:57.539 --> 00:57:00.250
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

612
00:57:19.144 --> 00:57:20.562
So where you been?

613
00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:26.067
SHU at Pelican Bay and Folsom B-wing.

614
00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:31.239
I am a cowboy,
looking for anything heavy.

615
00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:33.241
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

616
00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:36.077
That is why I am here.

617
00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:44.752
Why don't you...

618
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:47.922
Why don't you call this guy?

619
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.051
This guy's always putting guys on.

620
00:57:55.221 --> 00:57:56.222
Thank you, brother.

621
00:58:05.231 --> 00:58:07.233
What's so funny?

622
00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.943
It's really dumb.

623
00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:10.653
You smell pretty.

624
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.321
You two are perfect for each other.

625
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:14.824
How did you meet?

626
00:58:18.453 --> 00:58:20.705
I knew this guy in grade school.

627
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:22.623
His name was Raul...

628
00:58:22.707 --> 00:58:25.293
Whatever. Anyway,
the guy could take his fingers, right,

629
00:58:25.377 --> 00:58:26.961
and fold them over, one over the other,

630
00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:28.879
and then he'd turn his eyelids
inside out.

631
00:58:28.963 --> 00:58:32.175
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

632
00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:38.056
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

633
00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:44.187
Woman.

634
00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.443
Oh.

635
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:52.612
This better be earth-shattering.

636
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:00.703
To Raul.

637
00:59:00.787 --> 00:59:02.913
- Raul.
- To Raul.

638
00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:04.708
Yeah. Vincent Hanna.

639
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.877
Here's how we found her.

640
00:59:53.214 --> 00:59:54.215
How old?

641
00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:58.010
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

642
00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:59.679
How'd she die, Rachel?

643
00:59:59.763 --> 01:00:03.141
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

644
01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.810
Who did this?

645
01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.103
Who's that?

646
01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.939
- Mother and siblings, I guess.
- What the hell they doing here?

647
01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:13.773
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

648
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.237
Okay, let's go.

649
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:21.910
Nice.

650
01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:24.745
When I run a DNA check on the semen,

651
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:26.956
my intuition says
it's coming up the same guy,

652
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.209
so it's a series,
and ending up in your court.

653
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.128
Sheriff's Homicide getting
anywhere on theirs?

654
01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.379
Not yet.

655
01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.382
- Get her.
- Get off me. Get off of me!

656
01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.092
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

657
01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:40.761
- Oh, my God!
- Hold it, hold it.

658
01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.931
Oh, my God!

659
01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:47.644
- Where is she?
- Easy, easy, easy.

660
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.732
Okay. It's okay.

661
01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.819
It's okay. It's okay.

662
01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.487
Who did this?

663
01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.366
Where's my baby? Where is she?

664
01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:04.911
I need to know what happened.

665
01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.705
I guess the earth shattered.

666
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.834
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.921
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

668
01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.214
What was it?

669
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.675
You don't want to know.

670
01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:04.929
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:07.765
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

672
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:11.227
You never told me I'd be excluded.

673
01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:14.939
I told you when we hooked up, baby,

674
01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.316
that you were gonna have to share me

675
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.070
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:25.783
And I bought into that sharing
because I love you.

677
01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:29.703
I love you fat, bald,
money, no money, driving a bus.

678
01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:31.331
I don't care.

679
01:02:32.206 --> 01:02:35.042
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

680
01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:38.087
That's sharing.
This is not sharing. This is leftovers.

681
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.965
I see. What I should do is
come home and say,

682
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.759
"Hi, honey. Guess what."

683
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.679
I walked into this house today
where this junkie asshole

684
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.891
just fried his baby in a microwave
because it was crying too loud,

685
01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:52.810
so let me share that with you.

686
01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.562
Come on. Let's share that.

687
01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:58.065
And in sharing it, we'll somehow, uh,

688
01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.860
"cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

689
01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:01.945
Right?

690
01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.032
Wrong. You know why?

691
01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:09.368
Because you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.662
We fuck, then you lose
the power of speech.

693
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.540
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

694
01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.376
I preserve it, because I need it.

695
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.587
It keeps me sharp, on the edge,

696
01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.339
where I gotta be.

697
01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.348
You don't live with me.

698
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.478
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.817
You read the terrain.

700
01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:45.446
You search for signs of passing,

701
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.698
for the scent of your prey,

702
01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.492
and then you hunt them down.

703
01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.955
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

704
01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:00.169
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

705
01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:08.720
What I don't understand
is why I can't cut loose of you.

706
01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:27.113
Hey, it's Lilly.

707
01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.366
Let's go, baby.

708
01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:36.622
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

709
01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.750
Did time for what
that motherfucker does every day.

710
01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:45.255
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

711
01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:47.425
Can you do that?

712
01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:51.971
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

713
01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.271
What you hanging with me for, Lilly?

714
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.858
Because I'm proud of you.

715
01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.533
- You're proud of me?
- Mm-hmm.

716
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.331
What the hell you proud of me for?

717
01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.292
Come on home.

718
01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:34.013
What were you doing there?

719
01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:38.225
I was skiing. I was trying to ski.

720
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.601
That's what people do there.

721
01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:44.231
You go skiing, and you, um...
you meet people.

722
01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.774
You try to have a good time.

723
01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.609
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

724
01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:48.902
Why not?

725
01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:51.655
I'm not good at meeting people.

726
01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:52.949
You met me.

727
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.577
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it,

728
01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.371
which is why, probably.

729
01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.415
No. It's because you are fine.

730
01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.503
Eady...

731
01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.215
Take off with me for a while.

732
01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:11.008
Where?

733
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.551
New Zealand.

734
01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.346
When?

735
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.475
I have to go separate.
You could meet me there.

736
01:06:20.184 --> 01:06:21.685
But my job, my...

737
01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:23.979
I got money. You don't need money.

738
01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.149
You could set up a studio, do work there.

739
01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:29.735
- I don't know.
- What's there to know?

740
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.279
Are you married?

741
01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:34.573
- What?
- You come and go.

742
01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.200
The last thing I am is married.

743
01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:39.495
I'm a needle starting at zero,
going the other way, a double blank.

744
01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.164
Then all of a sudden

745
01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:44.083
someone like you comes along.

746
01:06:47.753 --> 01:06:50.339
- You don't know me, Neil.
- I know enough.

747
01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:55.720
Come with me.

748
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.481
What's wrong, baby?

749
01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:11.569
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

750
01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:17.825
Yeah.

751
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.538
Good.

752
01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:50.065
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

753
01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.799
What happened?
You forget your mom was picking you up?

754
01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.571
No.

755
01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.158
So, what's going on?

756
01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.745
I felt like being alone.

757
01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.583
Okay, come on. I'll drive you home.

758
01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.716
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi, Lauren.

759
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:05.558
What's happening?

760
01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:08.644
Lieutenant, sir.

761
01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:11.271
Captain Jackson wants
to know what's going on.

762
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:14.567
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

763
01:10:08.662 --> 01:10:09.872
Technique.

764
01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.894
Open sesame. Right there.

765
01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.327
There.

766
01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.933
- We walk.
- I'm right there.

767
01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.477
We walk now! Come on.

768
01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:52.535
He's heard it. He's heard it.

769
01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:02.503
Heads up.

770
01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:06.047
- One's coming out.
- Just hold it, Captain.

771
01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.592
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

772
01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:09.677
Yeah, I see.

773
01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:15.140
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

774
01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.726
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

775
01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:28.570
- Okay, let them go.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

776
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.006
<i>- We can take them!</i>
- What? On what?

777
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.259
What are you going to take them on?
Breaking and entering?

778
01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:34.284
They didn't steal anything yet.
Don't you get it?

779
01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.870
It gets knocked back
to some chickenshit misdemeanor.

780
01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.331
They do six months, and they're out.
No fucking way.

781
01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.851
I'm not taking the heat from my bosses
'cause you let them go.

782
01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:44.187
- They're not walking.
- That's exactly what they're gonna do.

783
01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.338
They're gonna walk.
This is my operation.

784
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.216
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

785
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.801
They will walk away,
and you will let them.

786
01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.345
Fuck!

787
01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.559
Back to work.

788
01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:45.564
LAPD. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

789
01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:48.858
Maybe it's the score they were on to.
The place, not us.

790
01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:51.611
'Cause it's been hit a couple of times,
you know, something?

791
01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:53.863
Assume they got our phones.
Assume they got our houses.

792
01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:56.616
Assume they got us
right here, right now as we sit.

793
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.702
Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.912
How are we gonna buy
the bank package from Kelso?

795
01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.664
I'll front that. That's not a problem.

796
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.874
What the hell happens
to Van Zant and our 750?

797
01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.436
Van Zant. Listen, with the heat we got,

798
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.480
you wanna play World War I I
in the streets with Van Zant?

799
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.547
No, I want my 750. What, he gets a pass?

800
01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:13.675
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you.

801
01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.218
He is a fucking luxury.

802
01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.887
Our problem is take the bank
or split right now.

803
01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:20.432
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

804
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.768
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

805
01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:26.105
That's it. Chris.

806
01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.193
The bank is worth the risk.

807
01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.570
I need it, brother.

808
01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:38.450
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

809
01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:52.881
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

810
01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:55.926
Not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

811
01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.983
You figure this is the best thing to do?

812
01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:15.654
- This is the best thing to do?
- I got plans. I'm going away after this.

813
01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.781
So for me, the reward
is maybe worth the stretch.

814
01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.825
But Elaine takes good care of you,
you got plenty put away,

815
01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.577
you got T-bonds, real estate.

816
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:25.706
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

817
01:16:43.515 --> 01:16:47.686
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

818
01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.438
I'm in.

819
01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.528
- You too?
- Yeah, sure.

820
01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.780
Let's go.

821
01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.782
Fuck 'em! Let's do it.

822
01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:03.216
All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

823
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.092
- You can't go in there.
- Watch this.

824
01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:21.428
- Excuse me. Hey, wait.
- Uh, Tim, I gotta call you back.

825
01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.552
- You have to have an appointment!
- May I help you?

826
01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:26.516
- Are you Alan Marciano?
- Yeah. And who the fuck are you?

827
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.600
Who am I?

828
01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.854
- Hey! Hey!
- Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

829
01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:34.274
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here!

830
01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.819
Hey, hey. I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around.

831
01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.696
But I know people here, okay?

832
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.242
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

833
01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:47.078
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant

834
01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:50.331
for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago,

835
01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:52.709
or you go to work for us.

836
01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:56.004
Cut and dried. That is it.

837
01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:57.589
Oh, shit.

838
01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.633
Charlene Shiherlis.

839
01:18:00.717 --> 01:18:01.718
Who?

840
01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.763
"Who? Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

841
01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.806
The lady you've been talking dirty to

842
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:08.975
on the telephone every day the last week.

843
01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.204
Yeah, all right. You know what?
You can't tie me to her.

844
01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:15.231
Well, who needs to? Because your ass is
on a plane back to New Jersey, jag-off.

845
01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:16.859
Oh, man, I just...

846
01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.360
Why'd I get mixed up with that bitch?

847
01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:22.239
'Cause she got a... great ass!

848
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.910
And you've got your head
all the way up it!

849
01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.495
Jesus.

850
01:18:30.622 --> 01:18:32.791
When I think of asses,

851
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.751
a woman's ass,

852
01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.503
something comes out of me.

853
01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:40.674
- So?
- So, no big thing.

854
01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:45.970
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.504
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

856
01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.897
- San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
- Uh-huh.

857
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.775
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:02.154
Right. The security systems
around here are a joke.

859
01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:10.217
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge.
That's escape route number one.

860
01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:14.207
Number two, over here.
Anaheim to the 110.

861
01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:15.291
Good.

862
01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:16.626
- Okay?
- Yeah, that's nice.

863
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.587
Got it? Good. Let's go.

864
01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.568
They were looking back

865
01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.530
in this direction.

866
01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.241
A container facility?

867
01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:49.742
What? Cartage theft?

868
01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:52.955
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

869
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.043
Next door's an oil refinery.
Over there's a scrapyard.

870
01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.880
Refinery only pays by check.
No cash around.

871
01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.715
Same for the scrapyard.

872
01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:08.685
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

873
01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.352
A refinery and a scrapyard.

874
01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:19.940
- What the hell is going on?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

875
01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.150
We thought we had it.

876
01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.736
Thought we had it.

877
01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.998
I got an idea

878
01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.418
of what they were looking at.

879
01:20:42.587 --> 01:20:45.215
- Wanna know what they're looking at?
- What?

880
01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:49.428
I mean, is this guy something
or is he something?

881
01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.306
This crew is good.

882
01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.708
You know what they're looking at?

883
01:20:57.769 --> 01:20:58.979
What?

884
01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:01.231
Us.

885
01:21:02.774 --> 01:21:06.611
The LAPD. The police department.

886
01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.448
We just got made.

887
01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.790
Yeah!

888
01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:28.800
Okay.

889
01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.561
Okay, motherfucker!

890
01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.833
Kelso come through?

891
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.628
Yeah.
You can build a bank with these.

892
01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:14.053
The name is Hanna. First name, Vincent.

893
01:22:14.137 --> 01:22:16.681
I smeared this sergeant
in Vice five yards.

894
01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.599
Hanna's all over you.

895
01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:21.894
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis.

896
01:22:21.978 --> 01:22:24.355
Not yours.
They've been losing you at night.

897
01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:28.609
Hanna's a hot dog.
Graduate school, Marine Corps.

898
01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:30.778
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

899
01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:32.196
He's taken down some heavy crews.

900
01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.034
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago,
and he was a fucking maniac.

901
01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:38.912
He was working Narcotics before that.

902
01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.081
Had some problems. Divorced twice.
Current wife's Justine.

903
01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:43.750
He's why the extra heat.

904
01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.088
The Vice sergeant

905
01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.091
says Hanna likes you.

906
01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.845
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

907
01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:58.557
Look how sharp this guy is
to figure that.

908
01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.186
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

909
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.270
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

910
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.400
It means the man is
one of those guys out there,

911
01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:11.862
prowling around all night, dedicated.

912
01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.956
With this guy, this much heat,
you should pass.

913
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.625
It's worth the stretch.

914
01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.253
This guy can hit or miss.

915
01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.839
You can't miss once.

916
01:23:31.756 --> 01:23:33.591
You sure?

917
01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:35.260
I am sure.

918
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:42.601
Let's go to the garage.

919
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:57.741
Justine!

920
01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:04.789
Justine!

921
01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.547
Where are we going?

922
01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:21.223
- Okay, where are you going?
- Out.

923
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:20.823
What are they on?

924
01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.534
Tac 9.

925
01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:26.579
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.</i>

926
01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:28.415
<i>We got four ground units and air.</i>

927
01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.310
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

928
01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.646
<i>Hey, Vincent, it's J.J. I'm in Air 40.</i>

929
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.397
<i>Richie Glover's with me.</i>

930
01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:57.526
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound,
approaching the 110 interchange.</i>

931
01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:59.570
You running a revolving tail?

932
01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:02.573
<i>Yeah. I got two units in front,
three behind.</i>

933
01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:06.077
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

934
01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:08.371
Let's go.

935
01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:02.383
Am I a hundred yards, or what?
Am I close or far or what?

936
01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.427
<i>300 yards, center lane.</i>

937
01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:12.871
How you doing?

938
01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:19.335
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

939
01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:27.177
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

940
01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.179
Follow me.

941
01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:49.407
Seven years in Folsom.
In the hole for three.

942
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:50.867
McNeil before that.

943
01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:56.164
McNeil as tough as they say?

944
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.542
You looking to become a penologist?

945
01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:02.628
You looking to go back?

946
01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:06.799
I've chased down some crews' guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

947
01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:08.092
That you?

948
01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.471
You must have worked some dipshit crews.

949
01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:13.848
I worked all kinds.

950
01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.687
You see me doing thrill-seeker
liquor store holdups

951
01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:22.690
with a "born to lose" tattoo on my chest?

952
01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.984
- No, I do not.
- Right.

953
01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:28.530
I am never going back.

954
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.367
Then don't take down scores.

955
01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:36.245
I do what I do best. I take scores.

956
01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:39.249
You do what you do best...
Tryin' to stop guys like me.

957
01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:45.338
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

958
01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:49.217
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

959
01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.053
Yeah.

960
01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.589
This regular-type life, that your life?

961
01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:59.394
My life? No. My life...

962
01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:02.647
No, my life's a disaster zone.

963
01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:07.318
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up

964
01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:10.488
because her real father's
this large-type asshole.

965
01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.448
I got a wife.

966
01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:16.035
We're passing each other on
the downslope of a marriage... my third.

967
01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:21.874
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

968
01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.459
That's my life.

969
01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:31.342
Guy told me one time...

970
01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:35.179
don't let yourself
get attached to anything

971
01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.973
you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat

972
01:30:38.057 --> 01:30:40.143
if you feel the heat around the corner.

973
01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:45.231
Now, if you're on me
and you gotta move when I move,

974
01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:48.484
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

975
01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:51.904
Well, that's an interesting point.

976
01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:54.824
What are you, a monk?

977
01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.952
I have a woman.

978
01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:59.370
What do you tell her?

979
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:04.000
I tell her I'm a salesman.

980
01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.343
So then, if you spot me
coming around that corner,

981
01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.310
you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

982
01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:19.390
Not say goodbye?

983
01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.601
That's the discipline.

984
01:31:22.685 --> 01:31:24.770
That's pretty vacant, no?

985
01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.564
Yeah, it is what it is.

986
01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:29.348
It's that, or we both
better go do something else, pal.

987
01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:33.211
I don't know how to do anything else.

988
01:31:33.863 --> 01:31:35.156
Neither do I.

989
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.535
I don't much want to either.

990
01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:41.621
Neither do I.

991
01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:53.132
You know, I have
this, uh, recurring dream.

992
01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.926
I'm sitting at this big banquet table,

993
01:31:56.010 --> 01:32:00.514
and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table,

994
01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:05.060
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs

995
01:32:05.144 --> 01:32:07.938
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages

996
01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:10.399
from the head wounds.

997
01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:14.153
And there they are,
these big balloon people,

998
01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:17.337
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

999
01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:20.535
The neighbors reported the smell.

1000
01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:24.872
And there they are,
all of them, just sitting there.

1001
01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.209
What do they say?

1002
01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.211
Nothing.

1003
01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:34.382
- No talk?
- No. Just...

1004
01:32:35.174 --> 01:32:37.260
They don't have anything to say.

1005
01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:39.679
See, we just look at each other.

1006
01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:43.766
They look at me, and that's it.

1007
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:45.893
That's the dream.

1008
01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.731
I have one where I'm drowning,

1009
01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:54.235
and I gotta wake myself up and
start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1010
01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:57.780
You know what that's about?

1011
01:32:57.864 --> 01:33:01.033
Yeah. Having enough time.

1012
01:33:02.493 --> 01:33:05.871
Enough time...
to do what you want to do?

1013
01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:07.373
That's right.

1014
01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.377
You doing it now?

1015
01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:12.754
No. Not yet.

1016
01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.052
You know, we're sitting here...

1017
01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:23.847
You and I
are like a couple of regular fellas.

1018
01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:26.601
You do what you do.
I do what I gotta do.

1019
01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:31.856
And now that we've been face-to-face...

1020
01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:37.069
if I'm there and I gotta put you away,

1021
01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:38.654
I won't like it.

1022
01:33:39.572 --> 01:33:40.656
But I'll tell you...

1023
01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:46.787
if it's between you and some poor bastard

1024
01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:49.415
whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow,

1025
01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.920
brother, you are going down.

1026
01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:08.392
There's a flip side to that coin.

1027
01:34:10.853 --> 01:34:13.647
What if you do got me boxed in,

1028
01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:15.233
and I gotta put you down?

1029
01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:20.613
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

1030
01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:24.200
We've been face-to-face, yeah.

1031
01:34:27.537 --> 01:34:30.957
But I will not hesitate,
not for a second.

1032
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:38.714
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

1033
01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:44.845
Or, who knows?

1034
01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:48.015
Well, maybe we'll never
see each other again.

1035
01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:04.740
They dumped us.

1036
01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.701
What?

1037
01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:08.870
They dumped us.

1038
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.664
- What do you mean, they dumped us?
- Chris slipped his tail.

1039
01:35:12.748 --> 01:35:14.875
He doesn't talk about
their scores with Charlene,

1040
01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.586
so there's nothing for me
to get from Marciano... I just tried.

1041
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:20.047
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1042
01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:22.925
Transponders got put
on a bus to San Clemente.

1043
01:35:25.469 --> 01:35:27.387
They dumped all our surveillance?

1044
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.849
Yeah. At the same time... 9:00 p.m.

1045
01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:34.436
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1046
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.897
- We were on you.
- Then McCauley drives into LAX,

1047
01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:39.858
where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

1048
01:35:39.942 --> 01:35:42.653
His car's still there. He's gone.

1049
01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:50.702
Does anybody have any idea

1050
01:35:50.786 --> 01:35:52.872
where the fuck these people are?

1051
01:36:51.263 --> 01:36:53.057
You hear from him yet?

1052
01:36:54.183 --> 01:36:56.810
Not a thing,
and not hearing bothers me more.

1053
01:36:56.894 --> 01:36:58.354
Where is this guy?

1054
01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:04.860
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

1055
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:11.701
Who are you?

1056
01:37:13.035 --> 01:37:16.747
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

1057
01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:18.631
I've been living in this office
day and night.

1058
01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:19.958
How well do you know him?

1059
01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:24.380
Oh, we took some major scores together.

1060
01:37:27.758 --> 01:37:32.220
- How come I haven't heard from him?
- Well, he's probably busy right now.

1061
01:37:32.304 --> 01:37:33.806
But he's real thorough.

1062
01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:37.351
He ain't gonna forget about you.

1063
01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:39.061
Oh, that's reassuring.

1064
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.607
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

1065
01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:47.445
Probably be a big help to you.

1066
01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:09.842
You recognize the grill man?

1067
01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:19.476
- No.
- Folsom.

1068
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.271
D block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1069
01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:27.651
- I ain't got my break yet, man.
- Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1070
01:38:27.735 --> 01:38:30.570
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1071
01:38:30.654 --> 01:38:32.739
Take your break later.

1072
01:38:32.823 --> 01:38:34.491
Piece of shit.

1073
01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:35.826
Pick up!

1074
01:38:38.954 --> 01:38:40.289
Where the hell is he?

1075
01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.208
I wanna check the slot for a work car.

1076
01:38:43.292 --> 01:38:44.293
So did I.

1077
01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:50.466
Yeah?

1078
01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:53.135
Hang on.

1079
01:38:53.969 --> 01:38:55.012
Yeah?

1080
01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:57.472
Hey. Use the landline.

1081
01:38:57.556 --> 01:39:00.767
Call me at 103-7206.

1082
01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:02.061
All right.

1083
01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:13.864
Where are you?

1084
01:39:13.948 --> 01:39:17.048
There's cops all over me, man.
They're on me like a cheap suit.

1085
01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:19.203
I can't dump 'em.

1086
01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:23.373
They hip to the fact you spotted them?

1087
01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.668
No. No, they're doing parallels.

1088
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:32.340
- I can try to dump 'em again.
<i>- How are we gonna know if you did?</i>

1089
01:39:32.424 --> 01:39:34.324
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1090
01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.928
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1091
01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:38.847
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1092
01:39:38.931 --> 01:39:41.058
Last thing I wanted to do
is let you down.

1093
01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:07.877
Pick up.

1094
01:40:09.378 --> 01:40:12.214
Hey! Neil, man. What up?

1095
01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:15.258
- What's up, brother?
- What you doing here?

1096
01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:17.052
What I'm doing is
I am looking for a driver

1097
01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:20.388
who can handle the scanners
and a radio, right now, today.

1098
01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:22.099
You remember the drill?

1099
01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:23.517
Yeah, man. Sure.

1100
01:40:23.601 --> 01:40:25.018
You cool?

1101
01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:27.604
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1102
01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.399
One answer. Yes or no. Right now.

1103
01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:47.374
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1104
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.211
Out back in five.

1105
01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:02.389
What's burning?
What's burning? <i>¿Que quema?</i>

1106
01:41:02.473 --> 01:41:04.266
What is this?

1107
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:06.185
Where do you think you're going?

1108
01:41:16.362 --> 01:41:20.198
<i>And it will not stop
or answer radio communications.</i>

1109
01:41:20.282 --> 01:41:23.618
<i>The 184th vessel is called</i>
Jihn Yin Number One,

1110
01:41:23.702 --> 01:41:26.329
<i>and it's suspected of smuggling
Chinese illegal aliens.</i>

1111
01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:28.713
<i>It was spotted Saturday
by patrolling aircraft.</i>

1112
01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.659
- One minute, please.
- Sure.

1113
01:42:41.613 --> 01:42:43.949
- Stay down!
- Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1114
01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:46.159
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!

1115
01:42:46.243 --> 01:42:48.495
Put 'em up! Down! Down!

1116
01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.206
- Get on your knees.
- The keys.

1117
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.209
Get on your knees! Get on your knees!

1118
01:42:57.129 --> 01:42:59.256
Hey! Hey! Get over there!

1119
01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.966
Get the fuck... Get down!

1120
01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:03.593
Turn around!
Put your hands behind you! Behind you!

1121
01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.721
Get down! Stay down!

1122
01:43:07.056 --> 01:43:08.807
Get down! Get down!

1123
01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:10.308
Get down, you stupid son of a...

1124
01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:12.728
- Down! Down! Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1125
01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:18.776
Come on. Stay down.

1126
01:43:19.943 --> 01:43:23.071
We want to hurt no one. We're here
for the bank's money, not your money.

1127
01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:25.991
Your money is insured by the government.
You're not gonna lose a dime.

1128
01:43:26.075 --> 01:43:28.535
Think of your families.
Don't risk your life.

1129
01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:29.995
Don't try and be a hero.

1130
01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:33.707
Right now I want you to sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

1131
01:43:33.791 --> 01:43:36.167
Anybody feels sick,
anybody got heart trouble,

1132
01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:38.336
go ahead and lean against the wall.

1133
01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.838
Give me the key.

1134
01:43:39.922 --> 01:43:41.715
What... What key?

1135
01:43:43.384 --> 01:43:45.719
Get down and stay down!

1136
01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:49.181
Sit there. Sit there.
Don't move. Let it bleed.

1137
01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:00.192
Get down!

1138
01:44:25.467 --> 01:44:26.635
Hey! Hey!

1139
01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:36.728
Put your heads down!

1140
01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:40.774
- Don't look at me again. I'll kill you.
- Get down. Down.

1141
01:44:40.858 --> 01:44:42.817
Put your heads down, God...

1142
01:44:42.901 --> 01:44:44.778
Get down. Get down.

1143
01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.675
- Hey, Casals!
- Yeah?

1144
01:45:07.759 --> 01:45:10.470
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1145
01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:14.304
This CI, Hugh Benny, called in about
a bank they're looking at or something.

1146
01:45:14.766 --> 01:45:15.893
Vincent!

1147
01:45:16.602 --> 01:45:19.605
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1148
01:45:36.955 --> 01:45:39.374
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth,

1149
01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:43.212
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1150
01:46:20.749 --> 01:46:22.292
They're already coming out.

1151
01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:25.211
Okay, we're gonna have to
take them in the car.

1152
01:46:25.295 --> 01:46:27.213
Wait till they are all in.

1153
01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:29.716
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1154
01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:40.519
- Police! Move!
- What's going on?

1155
01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:43.647
Move. Move. Get down.

1156
01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:03.917
Move, move. LAPD, get down.

1157
01:47:05.419 --> 01:47:06.878
Move. Down, down, down.

1158
01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:12.175
We did it, huh, Neil? Huh?

1159
01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:17.472
Move!

1160
01:47:23.228 --> 01:47:24.396
Get down.

1161
01:47:32.446 --> 01:47:33.530
Fuck! Fuck!

1162
01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:35.157
Start the car!

1163
01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:53.675
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1164
01:48:16.573 --> 01:48:18.867
Son of a bitch! Go! Go!

1165
01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:54.778
Go!

1166
01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:21.304
Go!

1167
01:50:07.184 --> 01:50:09.019
Go!

1168
01:51:02.113 --> 01:51:03.698
Come on! Come on!

1169
01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.665
Get him out of here!

1170
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:37.440
Get down!

1171
01:51:40.652 --> 01:51:41.736
Shit!

1172
01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:52.872
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way!

1173
01:51:52.956 --> 01:51:54.999
Get them down now! Now!

1174
01:51:55.083 --> 01:51:56.633
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1175
01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:07.429
Out of the way!

1176
01:52:46.343 --> 01:52:48.219
Mommy?

1177
01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:55.977
Come here.

1178
01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:39.729
Come on, honey.

1179
01:53:41.564 --> 01:53:42.774
I got you.

1180
01:53:43.942 --> 01:53:45.151
It's okay.

1181
01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:49.071
<i>Tragedy in a Southland
neighborhood today.</i>

1182
01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.949
<i>A bank robbery spilled out
into the street.</i>

1183
01:53:52.033 --> 01:53:55.161
<i>Claudia Newman live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?</i>

1184
01:53:55.245 --> 01:53:57.371
<i>This afternoon,
this neighborhood was terrorized</i>

1185
01:53:57.455 --> 01:53:59.290
<i>by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1186
01:53:59.374 --> 01:54:01.542
<i>With the streets full
of midday shoppers and kids,</i>

1187
01:54:01.626 --> 01:54:03.127
<i>police and armed robbers traded...</i>

1188
01:54:03.211 --> 01:54:04.795
Excuse me. Um, bartender?

1189
01:54:04.879 --> 01:54:06.005
In a minute, lady.

1190
01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:08.841
<i>Robbery, pursuit, and finally, death.</i>

1191
01:54:08.925 --> 01:54:11.510
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood
is shaken today</i>

1192
01:54:11.594 --> 01:54:14.722

1195

1196
01:54:21.104 --> 01:54:23.731
<i>Also fatally wounded, another suspect,
Donald Breedan, who died...</i>

1197

Miss?

1198
01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:27.443
<i>Of multiple gunshot wounds
during the extensive gunfire</i>

1199

<i>between police and suspects.</i>

1200
01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:32.990
All right, hold him. Hold him.

1201
01:54:33.074 --> 01:54:34.774
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

1202
01:54:37.746 --> 01:54:38.913
All right.

1203
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:45.503
- So?
- He's got blood loss and shock.

1204
01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:48.274
I'm gonna give you quarter-gram vials
of morphine for the pain, okay?

1205
01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:50.049
Subcutaneous injections.

1206
01:54:50.133 --> 01:54:51.258
Bottom line.

1207
01:54:51.342 --> 01:54:54.178
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1208
01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:57.348
But his clavicle's fractured.
Can he rest for a while?

1209
01:54:58.349 --> 01:54:59.600
Six, seven hours.

1210
01:54:59.684 --> 01:55:01.227
- That's it?
- That's it.

1211
01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:03.605
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

1212
01:55:05.482 --> 01:55:06.941
Take off your shirt.

1213
01:55:13.782 --> 01:55:17.243
My... Look, my daughter
gave it to me as a Father's Day...

1214
01:55:17.327 --> 01:55:19.877
I don't give a shit who gave it to you.
Take it off.

1215
01:55:25.376 --> 01:55:27.879
Chris. Hey.

1216
01:55:29.923 --> 01:55:32.633
Chris, listen to me.

1217
01:55:32.717 --> 01:55:34.844
Nate's gonna pick you up.

1218
01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:37.055
He's gonna take you to his place.

1219
01:55:38.431 --> 01:55:41.183
- Where's Charlene?
- We gotta get out of here.

1220
01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:44.145
We're all over the six o'clock news.
We gotta get out of here.

1221
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:46.522
I'm not going without her.

1222
01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:47.690
Think about that.

1223
01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:50.151
I will meet you at Nate's.

1224
01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:51.819
Where are you going?

1225
01:55:51.903 --> 01:55:55.553
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1226
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:57.408
Who did it?

1227
01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.120
Who wasn't there?

1228
01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:02.789
Trejo.

1229
01:56:06.417 --> 01:56:07.585
I'll see you at Nate's.

1230
01:56:14.259 --> 01:56:17.845
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah. You still want me?

1231
01:56:17.929 --> 01:56:22.058
You come down here right now,
and you get Dominick and me. Okay?

1232
01:56:22.142 --> 01:56:24.727
<i>Okay, baby. Okay.
I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1233
01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:28.481
<i>- All right? Okay?</i>
- All right.

1234
01:56:28.565 --> 01:56:33.819
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1235
01:56:33.903 --> 01:56:36.739
You're on a plane for Los Angeles.

1236
01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:37.824
Right.

1237
01:57:25.914 --> 01:57:28.208
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1238
01:57:29.792 --> 01:57:31.210
- They made me.
- Who?

1239
01:57:31.294 --> 01:57:32.295
Where's Anna?

1240
01:57:34.088 --> 01:57:37.008
She's dead.

1241
01:57:38.051 --> 01:57:40.801
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1242
01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:43.931
Who did it? Who did it?

1243
01:57:44.015 --> 01:57:45.975
They had Anna, man.

1244
01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:47.685
Who had her? Who?

1245
01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:49.395
Waingro.

1246
01:57:50.355 --> 01:57:53.524
Waingro? On his own?

1247
01:57:55.401 --> 01:57:57.945
- For someone.
- Who?

1248
01:57:58.029 --> 01:58:00.990
The... The other he worked for.

1249
01:58:01.074 --> 01:58:03.409
Van... Zant.

1250
01:58:06.287 --> 01:58:08.915
- Van Zant?
- Yeah.

1251
01:58:09.666 --> 01:58:11.750
Van Zant.

1252
01:58:11.834 --> 01:58:13.169
Are you sure?

1253
01:58:13.253 --> 01:58:14.837
Van Zant.

1254
01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:19.156
Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1255
01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:21.511
I don't think so, Neil.

1256
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:24.013
Come on.

1257
01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:26.849
I don't remember, Neil.

1258
01:58:32.355 --> 01:58:35.566
- I'll call a medic.
- I'm not gonna make it.

1259
01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:39.821
I can't feel nothing.

1260
01:58:42.073 --> 01:58:43.533
My Anna's gone.

1261
01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:47.704
She's gone.

1262
01:58:49.747 --> 01:58:52.041
Don't leave me like this, Neil.

1263
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:54.002
Please, homes.

1264
01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:57.463
Don't leave me like this.

1265
01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.239
- Yeah.
<i>- Nate.</i>

1266
01:59:24.198 --> 01:59:26.951
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1267
01:59:27.035 --> 01:59:28.703
It's a new one.

1268
01:59:30.330 --> 01:59:34.625
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace,
Encino, 10725.

1269
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:37.420
10725. Okay, Chris?

1270
01:59:38.129 --> 01:59:39.922
He's with me, my place.

1271
01:59:40.006 --> 01:59:42.467
Next, Waingro. Okay?

1272
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:45.678
You got the time?

1273
01:59:46.721 --> 01:59:50.016
I'll make time.
And I need a new out laid on.

1274
01:59:50.892 --> 01:59:52.242
How do you know it's blown?

1275
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:55.229
How can I trust it?

1276
01:59:58.608 --> 02:00:00.109
Okay, you got it.

1277
02:00:00.902 --> 02:00:02.278
Stay healthy.

1278
02:00:07.658 --> 02:00:09.660
Charlene Shiherlis.

1279
02:00:10.453 --> 02:00:13.205
Drucker's got a safe house
in Venice to stash her in.

1280
02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:16.542
On Neil's transportation,
when we're done here, get on the phone.

1281
02:00:16.626 --> 02:00:18.794
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

1282
02:00:18.878 --> 02:00:21.922
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway laid on?

1283
02:00:22.006 --> 02:00:23.590
Sure, he did. Now he needs another one.

1284
02:00:23.674 --> 02:00:25.774
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1285
02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:29.888
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1286
02:00:29.972 --> 02:00:33.684
He's a CI for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1287
02:00:33.768 --> 02:00:36.895
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

1288
02:00:36.979 --> 02:00:39.565
Eight, ten hours
for him to set up a new out.

1289
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:42.151
After that, he's gone. Bye-bye. Bam!

1290
02:01:35.746 --> 02:01:37.414
You ratted McCauley to us.

1291
02:01:37.498 --> 02:01:40.125
How'd you know? Who told you?

1292
02:01:40.209 --> 02:01:43.087
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1293
02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:44.672
Who?

1294
02:02:12.533 --> 02:02:14.410
<i>Conley back in for Murphy.</i>

1295
02:02:14.494 --> 02:02:16.286
<i>Now Murphy with Leggett
right there with him.</i>

1296
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:18.370
<i>Murphy tees it up, now behind the net...</i>

1297
02:02:28.966 --> 02:02:30.051
Waingro. Where is he?

1298
02:02:31.385 --> 02:02:33.721
- Where is he?
- How the hell would I know?

1299
02:02:43.064 --> 02:02:45.066
I know.

1300
02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:03.542
Well, what do we have here, huh?

1301
02:03:03.626 --> 02:03:06.254
Isn't this pretty? Isn't this pretty?

1302
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:11.258
Oh, you slimy piece of shit.

1303
02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:13.102
You told me you wanted out
from under, right?

1304
02:03:13.177 --> 02:03:16.346
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1305
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.681
Yeah? What's your end?

1306
02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:19.392
I don't need no stupid broad.

1307
02:03:20.685 --> 02:03:23.520
- How'd I get into this?
- Hey, hey, hey, easy. Huh?

1308
02:03:23.604 --> 02:03:26.523
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1309
02:03:26.607 --> 02:03:29.485
Fix her a drink or something.
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1310
02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:30.570
Fuck her.

1311
02:03:32.989 --> 02:03:35.491
You better get in there
and stay in there.

1312
02:03:38.786 --> 02:03:40.621
Well, lookee here.

1313
02:03:42.206 --> 02:03:44.708
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
LAPD Homicide.

1314
02:03:44.792 --> 02:03:46.392
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1315
02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.004
He stays with me.

1316
02:03:48.879 --> 02:03:50.047
There we go.

1317
02:03:58.806 --> 02:04:00.182
So, what now?

1318
02:04:02.351 --> 02:04:06.147
Well, he's right.
Because you want out, this is out.

1319
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:10.400
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1320
02:04:10.484 --> 02:04:12.152
No shit.

1321
02:04:12.236 --> 02:04:15.239
That's right. You would have to.

1322
02:04:15.323 --> 02:04:19.535
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1323
02:04:19.619 --> 02:04:23.413
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory.

1324
02:04:23.497 --> 02:04:25.999
'Cause you've got
no living parents to take him,

1325
02:04:26.083 --> 02:04:30.546
so he ends up state-raised
in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1326
02:04:30.630 --> 02:04:32.298
Then he steals a car.

1327
02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:38.428
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1328
02:04:38.512 --> 02:04:40.890
Fucked for life.

1329
02:04:42.058 --> 02:04:44.644
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1330
02:04:46.437 --> 02:04:50.983
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1331
02:04:52.735 --> 02:04:55.571
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1332
02:04:56.447 --> 02:05:00.368
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1333
02:05:04.455 --> 02:05:07.208
- What else are you selling?
- All kinds of shit.

1334
02:05:08.793 --> 02:05:10.711
But I don't have to sell this,
and you know it,

1335
02:05:10.795 --> 02:05:13.297
'cause this kind of shit here
sells itself.

1336
02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:23.307
- <i>Danny, here's an update.</i>
- Hey, Schwartz, Drucker's on line two.

1337
02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:25.393
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1338
02:05:27.978 --> 02:05:30.147
Lieutenant, I have Sergeant Drucker
on the other line.

1339
02:05:30.231 --> 02:05:31.681
All right, conference him in.

1340
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:36.195
- Go ahead.
- Vincent, it's me.

1341
02:05:38.739 --> 02:05:40.825
One answer. What's it gonna be?

1342
02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:50.500
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1343
02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:53.795
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1344
02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:57.215
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life

1345
02:05:57.299 --> 02:05:59.926
and become a born-again good citizen.

1346
02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:04.765
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1347
02:06:04.849 --> 02:06:07.517
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew.

1348
02:06:07.601 --> 02:06:11.396
Then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1349
02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:14.524
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak

1350
02:06:14.608 --> 02:06:16.652
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1351
02:06:16.736 --> 02:06:20.822
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.

1352
02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:24.660
Waingro just got himself
a suite at the airport Marquis

1353
02:06:24.744 --> 02:06:26.745
under the name Jamieson.

1354
02:06:26.829 --> 02:06:28.080
He's there now.

1355
02:06:28.164 --> 02:06:31.124
I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies,

1356
02:06:31.208 --> 02:06:34.503
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in county,</i>

1357
02:06:34.587 --> 02:06:36.922
anyone you can think of
who will put it on the street.

1358
02:06:37.006 --> 02:06:38.674
Deploy a team down at the hotel

1359
02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:41.426
<i>and personally check
their comms every 30 minutes,</i>

1360
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:44.054
because maybe Neil will go for him.

1361
02:06:44.138 --> 02:06:45.639
Okay? How you feeling?

1362
02:06:46.348 --> 02:06:47.766
Banged up, but I'll live.

1363
02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:49.059
Okay.

1364
02:06:57.026 --> 02:06:58.068
He's here.

1365
02:06:59.153 --> 02:07:00.696
Neil is still here.

1366
02:07:01.864 --> 02:07:03.282
I can feel it.

1367
02:07:04.158 --> 02:07:05.493
But for how long?

1368
02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.538
Seven, eight hours max.

1369
02:07:18.547 --> 02:07:21.842
What did you do? That was you?

1370
02:07:21.926 --> 02:07:23.969
It's what I don't do.
I don't sell metal.

1371
02:07:24.678 --> 02:07:26.555
Would have been okay, you fly out after.

1372
02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:29.015
Now it's jammed. We gotta go together.

1373
02:07:29.099 --> 02:07:31.602
Those... Those other people were with you?

1374
02:07:33.729 --> 02:07:35.439
My friend Michael.

1375
02:07:36.857 --> 02:07:39.401
He knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

1376
02:07:43.405 --> 02:07:45.616
When it rains, you get wet.

1377
02:07:47.868 --> 02:07:49.453
Get packed. Let's go.

1378
02:07:56.585 --> 02:07:57.753
Eady!

1379
02:07:58.254 --> 02:07:59.255
Eady!

1380
02:08:08.973 --> 02:08:11.475
Why did you do this to me?

1381
02:08:22.611 --> 02:08:24.321
It's gonna be all right.

1382
02:08:24.405 --> 02:08:27.055
Do you understand that, baby?
It's gonna be all right.

1383
02:08:30.703 --> 02:08:32.121
It's gonna be all right.

1384
02:08:33.747 --> 02:08:34.999
All right?

1385
02:08:44.091 --> 02:08:46.969
There's a Camaro at this address.
Level D, slot 18.

1386
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.934
Here's some cash.

1387
02:08:56.979 --> 02:08:58.147
When's it over?

1388
02:09:01.650 --> 02:09:03.235
Twenty-two hours from now.

1389
02:09:03.319 --> 02:09:04.945
Then we get out of here clean.

1390
02:09:05.029 --> 02:09:07.406
When will you let me leave?

1391
02:09:11.327 --> 02:09:14.204
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1392
02:09:14.997 --> 02:09:16.999
Will you let me leave later?

1393
02:09:22.171 --> 02:09:23.797
It will be different.

1394
02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:27.051
Do you even understand?

1395
02:09:58.082 --> 02:09:59.583
It's ready.

1396
02:09:59.667 --> 02:10:00.876
Vincent.

1397
02:10:06.924 --> 02:10:09.301
This is my friend Ralph.

1398
02:10:09.385 --> 02:10:11.303
Y-You didn't tell me you were...

1399
02:10:12.388 --> 02:10:13.972
Oh, my God.

1400
02:10:14.056 --> 02:10:15.390
Where's Lauren?

1401
02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:17.267
She's at Elizabeth's.

1402
02:10:17.351 --> 02:10:18.852
Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1403
02:10:18.936 --> 02:10:22.586
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
- What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1404
02:10:23.399 --> 02:10:25.567
Don't you even get angry?

1405
02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:30.780
I'm angry. Yeah. I'm very angry, Ralph.

1406
02:10:30.864 --> 02:10:33.951
You know, you can ball my wife
if she wants you to.

1407
02:10:35.577 --> 02:10:38.580
You can lounge around here on her sofa

1408
02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.168
in her ex-husband's dead-tech,

1409
02:10:43.252 --> 02:10:46.797
post-modernistic, bullshit house
if you want to.

1410
02:10:49.299 --> 02:10:55.722
But you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

1411
02:10:55.806 --> 02:10:57.266
For God's sake.

1412
02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:05.649
Put the television set down.

1413
02:11:05.733 --> 02:11:07.150
I never cheated on you, bitch.

1414
02:11:07.234 --> 02:11:09.110
- Well, maybe you should have.
- I should have?

1415
02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.737
In a way, you're a party to this.

1416
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:14.032
Oh, yeah, I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1417
02:11:14.116 --> 02:11:16.035
Our situation is absurd.

1418
02:11:17.036 --> 02:11:21.165
- Uh, look, maybe I should...
- Shut up! Ralph, sit down!

1419
02:11:24.084 --> 02:11:27.921
Why is it I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

1420
02:11:28.005 --> 02:11:30.423
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1421
02:11:30.507 --> 02:11:32.801
- Mmm. How admirable.
- You bet.

1422
02:11:32.885 --> 02:11:36.055
- Except none of it's about us.
- No.

1423
02:11:37.431 --> 02:11:39.849
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac,

1424
02:11:39.933 --> 02:11:43.020
but you've been walking
through our life dead.

1425
02:11:44.146 --> 02:11:48.275
And now I have to demean myself
with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1426
02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.581
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1427
02:12:03.665 --> 02:12:09.212
The plane... charter terminal,
LAX, Hangar 17.

1428
02:12:09.296 --> 02:12:10.964
Call letters are 10-11 -Sierra.

1429
02:12:14.343 --> 02:12:18.054
Touches down,
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1430
02:12:18.138 --> 02:12:21.725
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed flight plan, the works.

1431
02:12:23.727 --> 02:12:26.021
- And where's Chris?
- He's gone.

1432
02:12:27.481 --> 02:12:28.524
What?

1433
02:12:29.358 --> 02:12:31.651
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

1434
02:12:31.735 --> 02:12:34.485
- Didn't you bring him here?
- Yeah, I brought him here.

1435
02:12:34.822 --> 02:12:35.906
What happened?

1436
02:12:37.157 --> 02:12:39.576
It's a free country, brother.

1437
02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:47.793
Check in with me at 9:00,
if everything's still cool.

1438
02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:50.754
All right.

1439
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:16.405
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1440
02:13:19.783 --> 02:13:21.535
I know life is short.

1441
02:13:22.286 --> 02:13:24.288
Whatever time you get is luck.

1442
02:13:26.999 --> 02:13:28.584
You want to walk?

1443
02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:33.255
You walk right now,

1444
02:13:34.882 --> 02:13:36.216
or on your own

1445
02:13:37.217 --> 02:13:39.678
on your own, you choose to come with me.

1446
02:13:46.226 --> 02:13:47.895
All I know is...

1447
02:13:50.105 --> 02:13:54.734
All I know is, there's no point
in me going anywhere anymore,

1448
02:13:54.818 --> 02:13:56.445
if it's gonna be alone

1449
02:13:57.946 --> 02:13:59.156
without you.

1450
02:14:06.538 --> 02:14:07.748
Eady.

1451
02:14:57.923 --> 02:15:00.341
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1452
02:15:00.425 --> 02:15:02.678
Okay, I'll hold.

1453
02:15:05.347 --> 02:15:06.847
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1454
02:15:08.016 --> 02:15:09.685
- Yeah. Do it.
- Shut up!

1455
02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:16.024
Now, just one second at the window,

1456
02:15:17.526 --> 02:15:19.236
and it's all over.

1457
02:15:53.312 --> 02:15:55.855
Pick it up, pick it up!

1458
02:15:55.939 --> 02:15:58.483
Watch it! Watch it right there!

1459
02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:10.954
Take it, take it!

1460
02:16:36.063 --> 02:16:37.898
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1461
02:17:09.221 --> 02:17:10.722
Hey, man.

1462
02:17:10.806 --> 02:17:12.390
Yeah?

1463
02:17:12.474 --> 02:17:15.310
You know any, uh,
place to rent around here?

1464
02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.271
Yeah.

1465
02:17:18.355 --> 02:17:22.234
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall.

1466
02:17:33.036 --> 02:17:35.455
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1467
02:17:43.839 --> 02:17:46.007
Unit two, this is command.

1468
02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:48.385
Take him at the street. Check him out.

1469
02:17:49.052 --> 02:17:50.429
<i>10-4.</i>

1470
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:15.828
<i>- Sergeant?</i>
- Yeah.

1471
02:18:15.912 --> 02:18:17.580
This guy is John Peterson.

1472
02:18:17.664 --> 02:18:18.706
<i>Valid ID.</i>

1473
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:22.543
<i>The car's registered to the last name
Bukowski, first name Gene.</i>

1474
02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:25.046
<i>Ran it to DMV. It's clean.</i>

1475
02:18:28.216 --> 02:18:29.217
Let him go.

1476
02:18:29.926 --> 02:18:31.135
Roger.

1477
02:18:31.219 --> 02:18:33.597
Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

1478
02:18:35.807 --> 02:18:37.309
It's a no-go, Vince.

1479
02:18:44.357 --> 02:18:49.320
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1480
02:18:49.404 --> 02:18:50.906
Yeah. That'd be nice.

1481
02:19:20.644 --> 02:19:22.186
<i>Yeah?</i>

1482
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:23.604
Yeah, what do you got?

1483
02:19:23.688 --> 02:19:25.023
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1484
02:19:36.952 --> 02:19:40.288
- Yeah.
- Hello. It's Vincent.

1485
02:19:40.372 --> 02:19:41.539
<i>What do you got?</i>

1486
02:19:41.623 --> 02:19:45.377
Nothing's going on.
Waingro went for ice. That's it.

1487
02:19:54.344 --> 02:19:55.679
You know what?

1488
02:19:58.223 --> 02:19:59.766
Neil is gone.

1489
02:20:02.477 --> 02:20:06.105
Bang! Flying like a bird.

1490
02:20:06.189 --> 02:20:08.066
Come on, Vincent. How do you know?

1491
02:20:10.235 --> 02:20:13.529
- We still got bait! Maybe some time...
- Got. Got. What do we got?

1492
02:20:13.613 --> 02:20:14.990
What do we got?

1493
02:20:15.865 --> 02:20:17.867
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1494
02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:20.870
You were good.

1495
02:20:22.497 --> 02:20:24.040
I'm going to the hotel.

1496
02:20:25.333 --> 02:20:27.335
I'm gonna take a shower.

1497
02:20:28.503 --> 02:20:31.548
Gonna sleep for a month.

1498
02:22:41.928 --> 02:22:43.054
Here.

1499
02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:51.896
Come on, baby.

1500
02:22:54.649 --> 02:22:56.860
Okay, okay, quick.

1501
02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:04.409
Shit. Why have you done this?

1502
02:23:10.457 --> 02:23:12.167
Where the fuck are my...

1503
02:23:13.543 --> 02:23:14.835
Okay, here.

1504
02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:16.879
Assholes.

1505
02:23:16.963 --> 02:23:18.589
Shoot themselves all fucking day.

1506
02:23:18.673 --> 02:23:21.426
Not you, baby. Not you!

1507
02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:28.057
<i>W-W</i>-Where would she be?

1508
02:23:28.141 --> 02:23:30.309
I mean, her name is Lauren.
Lauren Gustafson.

1509
02:23:30.393 --> 02:23:32.443
She's supposed to be here
with the police.

1510
02:23:38.943 --> 02:23:42.238
Help me. I-I-I need somebody to...

1511
02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:44.949
I got ya.

1512
02:23:47.911 --> 02:23:49.078
I got you, baby.

1513
02:23:50.246 --> 02:23:52.081
You'll be all right. I swear.

1514
02:23:52.165 --> 02:23:53.749
It's okay, baby.

1515
02:23:53.833 --> 02:23:57.420
Let's get a doctor!
Let's go! A doctor here!

1516
02:23:57.504 --> 02:24:00.005
- There's your mama. Your mama's here.
- Let's just calm down.

1517
02:24:00.089 --> 02:24:02.008
- Is she on any drugs?
- No.

1518
02:24:04.803 --> 02:24:07.805
I want you to get a trauma surgeon
down here and a vascular surgeon.

1519
02:24:07.889 --> 02:24:11.142
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel a pulse.

1520
02:24:11.226 --> 02:24:13.894
Her pressure's way down.
So is her respiration.

1521
02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:16.428
- You're gonna have to intubate her.
- It's ready.

1522
02:24:17.941 --> 02:24:19.692
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1523
02:24:19.776 --> 02:24:21.193
I don't know.

1524
02:24:21.277 --> 02:24:23.905
- Where did you find her?
- Bathtub.

1525
02:24:24.656 --> 02:24:25.948
Call respiratory, stat.

1526
02:24:26.032 --> 02:24:28.451
Give her large-bore,
normal saline, wide-open.

1527
02:24:28.535 --> 02:24:31.412
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units Oh-negative now.

1528
02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:33.146
Let's type and cross her for six.

1529
02:24:35.124 --> 02:24:37.126
Where is respiratory?
We need some more help.

1530
02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:38.919
Can you have respiratory come down now?

1531
02:24:39.003 --> 02:24:41.548
Have X-ray ready
for a post-intubation chest X-ray.

1532
02:24:46.678 --> 02:24:51.390
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery, and
she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1533
02:24:51.474 --> 02:24:52.892
Her vital signs are stable.

1534
02:24:52.976 --> 02:24:55.746
The surgeon will be out to speak to you
and let you know what's going on.

1535
02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:56.854
She's okay?

1536
02:24:56.938 --> 02:24:58.731
- She's doing good.
- She's gonna be okay.

1537
02:24:58.815 --> 02:25:00.649
She's gonna be okay, honey.

1538
02:25:00.733 --> 02:25:02.359
She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1539
02:25:02.443 --> 02:25:06.155
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself? Why?

1540
02:25:06.239 --> 02:25:09.576
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1541
02:25:13.997 --> 02:25:16.707
It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

1542
02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:19.168
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1543
02:25:19.252 --> 02:25:20.461
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1544
02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.130
I ain't going anywhere.

1545
02:25:35.184 --> 02:25:36.185
Yeah.

1546
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:37.770
It's me.

1547
02:25:38.479 --> 02:25:41.816
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1548
02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:43.740
On the driver's end,
I still can't find nobody,

1549
02:25:43.818 --> 02:25:45.820
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1550
02:25:45.904 --> 02:25:47.447
<i>One other thing.</i>

1551
02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:49.956
<i>You asked, so I gotta tell you.</i>

1552
02:25:50.825 --> 02:25:53.577
The guy you wanted checked into
the Hotel Marquis under Jamieson,

1553
02:25:53.661 --> 02:25:57.122
if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

1554
02:25:57.206 --> 02:25:58.749
You figured right.

1555
02:25:58.833 --> 02:26:00.585
So, so long, brother.

1556
02:26:02.754 --> 02:26:04.755
You take it easy.

1557
02:26:04.839 --> 02:26:06.549
You're home free.

1558
02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:09.886
Take it easy.

1559
02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:21.730
What is it?

1560
02:26:21.814 --> 02:26:24.484
Nothing. Home free.

1561
02:27:02.730 --> 02:27:04.648
I gotta take care of something.

1562
02:27:04.732 --> 02:27:05.942
Is there time?

1563
02:27:06.985 --> 02:27:08.069
There's time.

1564
02:27:36.931 --> 02:27:39.684
I'll be right back.
Just leave it running.

1565
02:28:21.684 --> 02:28:24.186
- <i>Registration.</i>
- Yeah. This is room service.

1566
02:28:24.270 --> 02:28:26.981
A Jamieson ordered a BLT,
and they screwed up his room number.

1567
02:28:27.065 --> 02:28:28.357
Could you give it to me, please?

1568
02:28:28.441 --> 02:28:30.161
<i>- They're always doing that.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

1569
02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:32.737
<i>- 1735.</i>
- Thank you.

1570
02:30:16.716 --> 02:30:18.509
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1571
02:30:18.593 --> 02:30:21.595
<i>We are currently
experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1572
02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:23.472
<i>Please do not panic.</i>

1573
02:30:23.556 --> 02:30:25.433
<i>Please do not take the elevators.</i>

1574
02:30:28.477 --> 02:30:30.562
<i>- Please take the nearest stairwell...</i>
- Shit.

1575
02:30:30.646 --> 02:30:33.326
- Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.
- I'm checking the stairs.

1576
02:30:33.399 --> 02:30:36.749
- If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.
<i>- Your attention, please...</i>

1577
02:30:40.114 --> 02:30:42.575
What about her dad?
You want me to call him?

1578
02:30:43.492 --> 02:30:46.245
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1579
02:30:46.329 --> 02:30:47.830
Oh.

1580
02:30:47.914 --> 02:30:49.457
And she chose you.

1581
02:30:52.084 --> 02:30:53.753
She picked your place.

1582
02:30:55.963 --> 02:30:57.506
It's not right what happened to her.

1583
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:59.634
No, it's not.

1584
02:31:03.846 --> 02:31:05.473
Oh, okay.

1585
02:31:16.067 --> 02:31:17.652
Is there any way that...

1586
02:31:20.196 --> 02:31:21.989
it could work out between us?

1587
02:31:25.076 --> 02:31:27.619
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1588
02:31:27.703 --> 02:31:30.456
But in the end...

1589
02:31:35.544 --> 02:31:37.338
You know, it's like you said.

1590
02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:44.679
All I am is what I'm going after.

1591
02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:54.146
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1592
02:32:04.699 --> 02:32:06.701
Well, go on, if you have to.

1593
02:32:08.244 --> 02:32:10.495
No. I'll stay.

1594
02:32:10.579 --> 02:32:13.207
No. I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1595
02:32:16.335 --> 02:32:17.712
Just be careful.

1596
02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:21.424
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1597
02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:23.467
Okay?

1598
02:33:20.775 --> 02:33:21.776
Yeah.

1599
02:33:24.153 --> 02:33:28.323
Security. There's a fire on three.
We have to evacuate all floors.

1600
02:33:28.407 --> 02:33:29.950
I can't leave here.

1601
02:33:38.876 --> 02:33:41.712
Why don't we just talk about this a bit,
huh, brother?

1602
02:33:56.227 --> 02:33:57.353
He's here on 17.

1603
02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:02.817
Look at me. Look at me.

1604
02:34:06.112 --> 02:34:07.321
Look at me.

1605
02:34:39.311 --> 02:34:40.687
LAPD. Don't move.

1606
02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:42.481
Put your hands on your head now!

1607
02:35:18.058 --> 02:35:20.435
Switch me to tac five.

1608
02:35:20.519 --> 02:35:23.105
Casals? J.J.?

1609
02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:25.482
Drucker, J.J.

1610
02:35:25.566 --> 02:35:28.068
<i>Vincent, I'm at the lobby level
by the stairwell.</i>

1611
02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:29.952
- What do you got?
<i>- Three teams are moving up</i>

1612
02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:32.531
<i>the other three elevators,
to the 17th-floor elevators.</i>

1613
02:35:32.615 --> 02:35:34.426
<i>All out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

1614
02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:35.770
<i>It's a mess... people everywhere.</i>

1615
02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:37.411
Fine. 10-4.

1616
02:36:08.567 --> 02:36:11.028
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

1617
02:36:24.083 --> 02:36:26.627
- Yeah, check the stairwell.
- I got it, sir.

1618
02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:56.323
Come on. Let's go.

1619
02:38:02.056 --> 02:38:04.058
- Let me have that shotgun.
- Yes, sir.

1620
02:44:22.185 --> 02:44:24.062
Told you I'm never going back.

1621
02:44:28.316 --> 02:44:29.359
Yeah.
