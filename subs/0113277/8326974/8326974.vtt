00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:57.171
Stabilize. Okay, here.
Where's the portable X-ray?

2
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:36.918
Check, charge, or cash?

3
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:43.883
Cash and, uh... make it out
to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

4
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.512
788.30.

5
00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:56.438
Okay.

7
00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:44.027
Oh, God.

8
00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:38.331
Hey. Taking me to breakfast?

9
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:39.875
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

10
00:05:41.752 --> 00:05:43.211
Hey, Vincent.

11
00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:45.004
Mom, where are my barrettes?

12
00:05:45.088 --> 00:05:47.008
- Hi, sweetie.
- I saw them on the kitchen table.

13
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.926
- They're not there. I already checked.
- Want me to make coffee?

14
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.387
- No school today?
- My dad's picking me up.

15
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.722
He's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

16
00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:56.556
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

17
00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:01.897
He's already a half an hour late.

18
00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:06.317
He gonna show, or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:09.071
- I'll make coffee.
- I'm out of time, baby.

20
00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:24.253
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not on the couch.

21
00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:28.840
- Oh, wear the blue ones.
- I don't want to wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:31.593
- They don't match.
- Did you check in your bathroom?

23
00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:33.261
I checked everywhere.

24
00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:34.804
Well, what do you want me to do?

25
00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:37.265
Find them! Mom, pay attention!

26
00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.143
- All right, sweetie. All right. What?
- Daddy's going to be here!

27
00:06:40.227 --> 00:06:42.247
- Well, okay. He's going to be...
- I'm not gonna be ready!

28
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:43.354
I can't be late.

29
00:06:43.438 --> 00:06:45.565
- You won't be late.
- No, I will be late!

30
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:48.776
Okay, listen, before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

31
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.945
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

32
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.989
It's all right. It's all right.

33
00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:57.160
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together. Just relax.

34
00:06:57.244 --> 00:07:00.706
He won't come before we find them.
I promise you.

35
00:07:10.173 --> 00:07:12.676
Hey, give me another refill.

36
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:25.939
What's your name?

37
00:07:26.023 --> 00:07:27.566
Waingro.

38
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.451
You're Michael, huh?

39
00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:52.633
Do you guys always work together?

40
00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:54.926
All the time.

41
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.553
Real tight crew, huh?

42
00:07:56.637 --> 00:07:57.638
Real tight.

43
00:07:58.722 --> 00:08:02.600
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:05.228
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:17.323
How's he doing?

46
00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:20.661
100%. Right on schedule.

47
00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:23.121
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

48
00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:27.083
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

49
00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:28.460
Okay.

00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:34.383
<i>102.7 KIIS FM!</i>

51
00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:53.109
Just crossed over the number-one lane.

52
00:08:53.193 --> 00:08:55.486
- 300 yards from you now.
- Get set.

53
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.780
I am.

54
00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:07.666
Here we go.

55
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.229
211! 211! We're being held up!

56
00:10:16.902 --> 00:10:19.404
<i>211 alarm. Armored car.</i>

57
00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:21.364
There's the call. Three minutes.

58
00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:24.201
Clear!

59
00:11:28.223 --> 00:11:30.058
Eighty seconds left!

60
00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:35.522
Get back. Get back! Get back!

61
00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:40.151
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

62
00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:42.779
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

63
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.919
I got it. I got it.

64
00:12:00.964 --> 00:12:03.299
Yeah, don't fuck with me.

65
00:12:03.383 --> 00:12:05.093
You want to fuck with me?

66
00:12:29.075 --> 00:12:31.953
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

67
00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:34.887
- What did you do? Let's go!
- That guy was making a move.

68
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:44.591
Dumb motherfucker!

69
00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:16.623
- Step out here please, sir.
- I heard them.

70
00:13:40.313 --> 00:13:41.606
A million six.

71
00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:45.276
Forty cents on the dollar,
640,000 to you.

72
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.362
150 front money.

73
00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:50.240
Get you the rest two, three days.

74
00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:52.951
Know who owned these?

75
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.082
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

76
00:13:59.791 --> 00:14:03.419
Roger Van Zant.
Owns banks in the Caymans.

77
00:14:03.503 --> 00:14:06.965
Runs investment portfolios for
offshore drug money, stuff like that.

78
00:14:07.632 --> 00:14:10.468
- So?
- So, you ripped off his bearer bonds.

79
00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:11.678
He's got insurance.

80
00:14:13.013 --> 00:14:15.973
That's the point.
He collects 100% from the insurance.

81
00:14:16.057 --> 00:14:19.977
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60% of their value,

82
00:14:20.061 --> 00:14:22.564
make 40% on top of the 100%.

83
00:14:24.607 --> 00:14:26.807
Sell it back to him instead of
going through the street,

84
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.696
- that's an extra 320,000 to you.
- Try it on him.

85
00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:33.324
- Kelso called.
- About what?

86
00:14:33.408 --> 00:14:35.808
A score he's putting out
he wants you to look at.

87
00:14:36.745 --> 00:14:38.704
Why do I need his score for?
I got my own.

88
00:14:38.788 --> 00:14:40.999
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

89
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.833
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

90
00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:44.169
What happened out there?

91
00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:46.921
Don't ask.

92
00:15:22.499 --> 00:15:25.042
- Find the ambulance?
- Dumped it four blocks from here.

93
00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:28.462
22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.
They torched it.

94
00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:31.046
Burned everything...
The guns, clothes, everything.

95
00:15:33.093 --> 00:15:34.218
They were airborne.

96
00:15:34.302 --> 00:15:38.202
They taped the last few seconds of the
black-and-whites doing demolition derby.

97
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.184
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.

98
00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:45.563
The yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
day before yesterday.

99
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:49.192
You taking this one, Lieutenant?
Or does it stay in division?

100
00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:54.071
This look like gangbangers
working the local 7-Eleven to you?

101
00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:56.073
Robbery-Homicide's taking it, yeah.

102
00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:58.034
- All yours.
- We got three motorists.

103
00:15:58.118 --> 00:16:00.786
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

104
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.581
Console TV man over there,
however, he was closer.

105
00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:06.459
He ID anybody?

106
00:16:06.543 --> 00:16:08.837
Well, he was hiding.
He heard it, mostly.

107
00:16:11.256 --> 00:16:13.549
Okay, what about them?

108
00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:16.969
All right, now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

109
00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:18.054
Smart.

110
00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:20.973
- Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."
- Slick?

111
00:16:21.057 --> 00:16:23.184
Yeah. Now this guy... I figure this guy

112
00:16:23.268 --> 00:16:27.146
went for that holdout piece,
ankle holster, right?

113
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.442
From here, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

114
00:16:31.526 --> 00:16:33.319
This side.

115
00:16:33.403 --> 00:16:38.574
This guy here got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

116
00:16:38.658 --> 00:16:41.410
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

117
00:16:41.494 --> 00:16:42.912
Probably executed.

118
00:16:44.747 --> 00:16:47.416
And it was a million six in bearer bonds.

119
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.126
And they ignored the loose cash.

120
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.088
'Cause they had no time,
'cause they were on a clock,

121
00:16:52.172 --> 00:16:55.132
which means they knew
our response time to a 211,

122
00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:58.344
had our air, immobilized it, entered,

123
00:16:58.428 --> 00:17:01.013
escaped in under three minutes.

124
00:17:01.097 --> 00:17:03.849
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

125
00:17:03.933 --> 00:17:07.269
Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.

126
00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:08.437
Traffic video camera?

127
00:17:08.521 --> 00:17:10.606
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

128
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.358
You recognize the MO?

129
00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:15.361
MO is that they're good.

130
00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:18.364
Once it escalated into a murder 1-B
for all of them,

131
00:17:18.448 --> 00:17:21.200
after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate.

132
00:17:21.284 --> 00:17:25.704
Popped guard number three,
because what difference does it make?

133
00:17:25.788 --> 00:17:27.414
Why leave a living witness?

134
00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:30.877
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock and roll.

135
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.339
The shaped charge.

136
00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:39.385
The shaped charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

137
00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:41.069
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

138
00:17:41.137 --> 00:17:45.099
Let's start looking for recent high-line
burglaries that have mystified us.

139
00:17:45.183 --> 00:17:47.601
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

140
00:17:47.685 --> 00:17:49.979
You're gonna get the phone book.
Do it anyway.

141
00:17:50.063 --> 00:17:52.273
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

142
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:56.694
Check the usual fences. You and I
will check Cuzomano and Torena.

143
00:17:56.778 --> 00:17:59.280
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

144
00:17:59.364 --> 00:18:03.576
Hang in with forensics. From
the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

145
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.579
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

146
00:18:08.122 --> 00:18:10.583
Get your hand out of
that man's pocket, Rachel.

147
00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:11.668
Hello, Vincent.

148
00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:20.426
Y'all want some pie?

149
00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:31.813
Got to go to the john.

150
00:19:02.468 --> 00:19:04.094
Look, I had to get it on, man.

151
00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.764
He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

152
00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:16.899
Damn it! God...

153
00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:21.237
Split's in the car.

154
00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:23.323
I took out of ours evenly

155
00:19:24.407 --> 00:19:26.367
to make up for his full end,

156
00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:31.789
because I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

157
00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:11.662
Hold it!

158
00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:48.342
Hey.

159
00:21:51.429 --> 00:21:53.847
- Where's the rest?
- We're late.

160
00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:55.432
You look too good to go out.

161
00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:57.518
I could just jump you right here.

162
00:22:01.022 --> 00:22:04.066
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

163
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.486
There's more in a couple days, so don't
sweat it. Come on. We really are late.

164
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.156
Yeah? Come on. You gotta be kidding me.

165
00:22:11.616 --> 00:22:15.285
Honey, it ain't worth
the risks you take for 8,000.

166
00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:18.163
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

167
00:22:18.247 --> 00:22:20.666
Let's go. Get your coat.

168
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.606
There is no point talking to you because
all you are is a child growing older.

169
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.047
What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:29.675
It means we're not making
forward progress

171
00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:31.927
like real, grown-up adults
living our lives.

172
00:22:32.011 --> 00:22:34.513
Because I'm married
to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

173
00:22:34.597 --> 00:22:36.247
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

174
00:22:37.934 --> 00:22:40.519
What am I doing
in this rat-bastard situation?

175
00:22:40.603 --> 00:22:42.438
You're not. What do you want from me?

176
00:22:42.522 --> 00:22:45.607
Leave the bankbook and the car keys
in the kitchen on your way out the door.

177
00:22:45.691 --> 00:22:47.943
- Now, are we going or...
- You can keep that other crap,

178
00:22:48.027 --> 00:22:49.779
but Dominick would go with me.

179
00:22:51.906 --> 00:22:53.533
Don't you even think about...

180
00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:20.601
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

181
00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:25.147
- Albert Torena call Vincent?
- No.

182
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:27.608
No. Report came in.

183
00:23:27.692 --> 00:23:30.944
The explosive was Dy-Ex, a linear-shaped
charge used in demolition.

184
00:23:31.028 --> 00:23:35.199
You can pick it up with a driver's
license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

185
00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:37.034
Too common to trace the sale, Vincent.

186
00:23:37.118 --> 00:23:38.995
Oh, that's wonderful.

187
00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:00.141
Are you all right?

188
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.393
What happened? Where have you been?

189
00:24:03.477 --> 00:24:04.687
Work.

190
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.565
Lauren's dad show up?

191
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:11.527
Didn't call. Didn't show.

192
00:24:11.611 --> 00:24:13.487
We waited for you till 10:30.

193
00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:19.285
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

194
00:24:21.245 --> 00:24:22.371
I don't know.

195
00:24:23.372 --> 00:24:24.874
Fucking jerk.

196
00:24:26.584 --> 00:24:27.877
Well, is she okay?

197
00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:32.631
She's been in her room all day,
so no, she's not okay.

198
00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:34.299
Neither am I.

199
00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:38.470
Uh, I made dinner for us four hours ago.

200
00:24:38.554 --> 00:24:42.558
Um, every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us,

201
00:24:42.642 --> 00:24:44.393
you withdraw.

202
00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:51.692
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

203
00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:56.488
I'm sorry if the goddamn chicken

204
00:24:56.572 --> 00:24:59.950
got... overcooked.

205
00:25:17.885 --> 00:25:20.638
<i>Seven men in Denmark
were key defendants here.</i>

206
00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:26.143
- Find it?
- Not yet.

207
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:29.229
- Here it is.
- Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

208
00:25:29.313 --> 00:25:31.816
- It's by author.
- Over here.

209
00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:40.658
- Interior Design?
- It's on the back wall.

210
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.718
- Coffee, sir?
- Please.

211
00:26:04.306 --> 00:26:05.850
Will you pass the cream?

212
00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:10.813
- Thanks.
- What did you get?

213
00:26:12.106 --> 00:26:13.107
What?

214
00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:15.408
What are you reading?

215
00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:23.033
Book about metals.

216
00:26:26.912 --> 00:26:29.248
<i>Stress Fractures In Titanium.</i>

217
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:32.334
What kind of work you do?

218
00:26:36.005 --> 00:26:38.955
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

219
00:26:43.596 --> 00:26:45.472
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

220
00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:46.682
What store?

221
00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:49.275
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

222
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:55.232
Uh, if you don't want to talk to me,
it's okay. Sorry I bothered you.

223
00:27:05.993 --> 00:27:09.871
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

224
00:27:09.955 --> 00:27:12.457
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

225
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:13.834
My name's Neil.

226
00:27:19.173 --> 00:27:21.008
I'm Eady.

227
00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:24.553
You like working there?

228
00:27:26.597 --> 00:27:28.140
Sure.

229
00:27:28.224 --> 00:27:31.601
I get a discount, and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

230
00:27:31.685 --> 00:27:33.812
What area's that?

231
00:27:33.896 --> 00:27:36.189
Graphic design.

232
00:27:36.273 --> 00:27:39.151
I do, um, letterheads
and logotypes at night,

233
00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:42.821
and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

234
00:27:42.905 --> 00:27:44.657
Who do you do that for?

235
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.453
Uh, a restaurant.

236
00:27:49.537 --> 00:27:52.498
I did their menus and, um,

237
00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:56.877
a small, uh, record label.

238
00:27:57.711 --> 00:27:59.045
CDs.

239
00:27:59.129 --> 00:28:01.674
I've done two so far.

240
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.885
Did you go to school for that?

241
00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:07.012
Yeah.

242
00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:09.055
Yeah, I went to Parsons.

243
00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:11.684
- Oh, where's that?
- New York City.

244
00:28:12.685 --> 00:28:14.235
And how long you been out here?

245
00:28:15.396 --> 00:28:16.856
About a year.

246
00:28:17.648 --> 00:28:18.648
Do you like it?

247
00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:21.526
Not really.

248
00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.029
I'm mostly here for the work.

249
00:28:31.287 --> 00:28:32.954
Live in this neighborhood?

250
00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:36.458
Ah, no.
I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

251
00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:38.585
It's actually kind of a...

252
00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:41.421
It's a little house that I rent,
and it's kind of rundown,

253
00:28:41.505 --> 00:28:44.133
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

254
00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:46.760
What about you?

255
00:28:46.844 --> 00:28:48.303
I live up here.

256
00:28:48.387 --> 00:28:50.139
That's very funny.

257
00:28:54.184 --> 00:28:56.812
So where's your family from originally?

258
00:28:56.896 --> 00:29:00.357
Oh, they're Scots-Irish.

259
00:29:01.483 --> 00:29:06.780
They, um... They emigrated
to Appalachia in the late 1700s.

260
00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:09.658
Where are you from?

261
00:29:10.784 --> 00:29:11.994
The Bay Area.

262
00:29:13.412 --> 00:29:14.622
Are your folks there?

263
00:29:17.499 --> 00:29:19.793
No. My mother died a long time ago.

264
00:29:19.877 --> 00:29:22.128
And my father, I don't know where he is.

265
00:29:22.212 --> 00:29:23.756
Got a brother somewhere.

266
00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:32.222
You have a tight family. I can tell.

267
00:29:32.306 --> 00:29:34.182
- Yeah.
- Right?

268
00:29:34.266 --> 00:29:35.601
You're right.

269
00:29:45.361 --> 00:29:47.029
City of Lights.

270
00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:53.702
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae

271
00:29:53.786 --> 00:29:56.121
that come out once a year in the water.

272
00:29:57.122 --> 00:29:58.922
That's what it looks like out there.

273
00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:01.794
You been there?

274
00:30:03.128 --> 00:30:04.922
No. I'm going there someday.

275
00:30:05.589 --> 00:30:06.882
Oh, yeah?

276
00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:15.182
You travel a lot?

277
00:30:18.018 --> 00:30:19.019
Yeah.

278
00:30:19.812 --> 00:30:21.355
Traveling makes you lonely?

279
00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:30.739
I'm... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

280
00:30:30.823 --> 00:30:31.991
You?

281
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:34.910
Real lonely.

282
00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:41.245
Albert!

283
00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:45.707
- Shit.
- Albert.

284
00:32:45.791 --> 00:32:48.293
Vincent, man, what are you doing
coming here for? You crazy?

285
00:32:48.377 --> 00:32:49.669
This ain't Disneyland, man.

286
00:32:49.753 --> 00:32:53.703
You were supposed to get back to me last
night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

287
00:32:54.508 --> 00:32:58.428
- I couldn't break free, Vincent.
- Let's violate his ass right now.

288
00:32:58.512 --> 00:33:01.389
I do for you. You don't do for me.

289
00:33:01.473 --> 00:33:02.599
Is that it?

290
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.727
Vincent, man, I swear,
I was out all night, man.

291
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:08.271
I'm hitting like one of them
flamenco matador guys.

292
00:33:08.355 --> 00:33:10.356
What's flamenco?
That's got nothing to do with me.

293
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.110
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

294
00:33:14.194 --> 00:33:15.487
I'm a dancer, man. You know?

295
00:33:15.571 --> 00:33:19.115
Bullshit. I paged your ass all day.
I can't stand fucking paging.

296
00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:21.868
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

297
00:33:21.952 --> 00:33:24.829
Oh, man, where's your empathy, brother?
It's a substance-abuse problem.

298
00:33:24.913 --> 00:33:28.666
Empathy was yesterday. Today,
you're wasting my motherfucking time.

299
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.002
- Vincent, man, look...
- Did you fall in love?

300
00:33:31.086 --> 00:33:33.630
Come on.
Did you fall in love last night?

301
00:33:33.714 --> 00:33:35.298
- And you went off somewhere?
- Vincent.

302
00:33:35.382 --> 00:33:38.510
Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.
You know what I mean? I'll buy that.

303
00:33:38.594 --> 00:33:39.803
V-Vincent.

304
00:33:39.887 --> 00:33:41.638
- Give me all you got!
- Vincent...

305
00:33:41.722 --> 00:33:43.890
Give me all you got!

306
00:33:43.974 --> 00:33:47.227
I swear, man, my brother...
My brother Richard is gonna talk to you.

307
00:33:47.311 --> 00:33:49.104
I heard Richard?

308
00:33:49.897 --> 00:33:52.899
- He gonna talk to you.
- Richard? Richard?

309
00:33:52.983 --> 00:33:54.943
He's gonna meet you, man, I swear.
Tonight!

310
00:33:55.027 --> 00:33:56.152
He's not here, is he?

311
00:33:56.236 --> 00:33:59.614
- No. He gonna meet you tonight.
- Tonight? What happened to right now?

312
00:33:59.698 --> 00:34:03.952
I-I-I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

313
00:34:04.036 --> 00:34:07.455
- This is a bunch of bullshit.
- No, I swear. He said no.

314
00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:09.333
- Because he in Phoenix.
- Ah.

315
00:34:10.792 --> 00:34:13.128
Listen, I swear, man,
tonight's the best...

316
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.810
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

317
00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:24.389
You know? He'll meet... He'll meet you

318
00:34:24.473 --> 00:34:29.310
at BJ's on Alvarado at 2:00 a.m.

319
00:34:29.394 --> 00:34:32.272
- Be there.
- You be there, too.

320
00:34:32.356 --> 00:34:35.233
Vincent, I can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vince.

321
00:34:35.317 --> 00:34:38.167
- I got things to do. I got places to be.
- Hey, hey, hey.

322
00:34:39.571 --> 00:34:40.614
Be there.

323
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.789
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

324
00:34:53.085 --> 00:34:54.336
What is it?

325
00:34:56.129 --> 00:34:57.797
It's a bank.

326
00:34:57.881 --> 00:35:01.259
It depots cash on Thursday for
distribution to all the other branches

327
00:35:01.343 --> 00:35:03.511
to cover Friday payroll checks.

328
00:35:03.595 --> 00:35:06.931
So, on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

329
00:35:07.015 --> 00:35:09.517
- On the prowl or strong?
- Strong. Through the front door.

330
00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:10.935
How many guys?

331
00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:12.854
Eh, four. Three plus the driver.

332
00:35:12.938 --> 00:35:14.814
You walk in,
you knock them over, you walk out.

333
00:35:14.898 --> 00:35:16.232
And you want 100,000 in advance

334
00:35:16.316 --> 00:35:18.693
- against a 10% cut for that?
- Uh-huh.

335
00:35:18.777 --> 00:35:20.820
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.

336
00:35:20.904 --> 00:35:24.804
They hit the holdup alarms, I gotta get
out before the cops show. What is that?

337
00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:27.619
They have three holdup alarm systems.

338
00:35:27.703 --> 00:35:29.871
Two telco and a cellular.

339
00:35:31.873 --> 00:35:34.709
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because...

340
00:35:34.793 --> 00:35:38.129
See, the night before, you cut in

341
00:35:38.213 --> 00:35:40.798
and trick out the alarm system computer

342
00:35:40.882 --> 00:35:44.636
to turn itself
and the video recorders off

343
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.670
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

344
00:35:47.264 --> 00:35:49.182
Architectural,
electrical engineering plans?

345
00:35:49.266 --> 00:35:51.826
I got all that. I got schematics.
I got the boards already built.

346
00:35:51.893 --> 00:35:53.603
They go straight into the CPU.

347
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.606
What's the estimate?

348
00:35:59.735 --> 00:36:01.903
12.1, 12.2 million.

349
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.533
You're on.

350
00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:10.203
Congratulations.
And to give you a little idea

351
00:36:10.287 --> 00:36:13.164
of where my estimates come from,
this is a printout...

352
00:36:13.248 --> 00:36:15.583
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

353
00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:19.045
Be that as it may, my way,
you get 100% from the insurance company,

354
00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:21.798
and take the bonds back from us
at 60 cents on the dollar

355
00:36:21.882 --> 00:36:24.217
<i>and make yourself another 40%.</i>

356
00:36:26.261 --> 00:36:29.011
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

357
00:36:30.098 --> 00:36:31.432
Sure. You got a deal.

358
00:36:31.516 --> 00:36:32.976
Good, because there's no percentage

359
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.311
if everyone gets their underwear
in a twist over this.

360
00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:39.148
Yeah. So you have your man call me,
and we'll set the meet.

361
00:36:39.232 --> 00:36:40.692
Yeah, okay.

362
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.527
Nice talking to you.

363
00:36:43.653 --> 00:36:45.363
You gonna deal with these guys?

364
00:36:45.447 --> 00:36:48.324
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

365
00:36:48.408 --> 00:36:51.119
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

366
00:36:51.203 --> 00:36:54.453
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

367
00:36:59.336 --> 00:37:02.148
As I was saying, that's not really
an estimate. Those are exact figures.

368
00:37:02.172 --> 00:37:05.341
I have the printout here of the cash
flow of the bank the past two months.

369
00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:07.427
How do you get this information?

370
00:37:07.511 --> 00:37:10.305
It just comes to you.
This stuff just flies through the air.

371
00:37:10.389 --> 00:37:13.391
They send this information out. It's
beamed out all over the fucking place.

372
00:37:13.475 --> 00:37:16.925
All you have to do is know how
to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

373
00:37:22.692 --> 00:37:24.610
Um, okay, here we go.

374
00:37:24.694 --> 00:37:26.279
13.9 million.

375
00:37:29.616 --> 00:37:33.036
- I bought it.
- Good. What did I tell you?

376
00:37:36.957 --> 00:37:37.958
Here.

377
00:37:39.376 --> 00:37:42.254
We're on.
Call Van Zant. Collect the money.

378
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.881
How is he?

379
00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.425
He's a businessman.

380
00:37:48.385 --> 00:37:49.553
Okay.

381
00:38:15.328 --> 00:38:17.246
Avocado.

382
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.791
"A-cah-do."

383
00:38:21.668 --> 00:38:23.462
- Hello.
<i>- Yeah, hello.</i>

384
00:38:24.588 --> 00:38:25.881
Chris is at my place.

385
00:38:29.259 --> 00:38:30.551
What's wrong?

386
00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:32.679
Husband and wife stuff.

387
00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:34.896
I'll let him sleep it off here.

388
00:38:49.488 --> 00:38:50.739
What happened to you?

389
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.371
- When you gonna get some furniture?
- When I get around to it.

390
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.293
Charlene's gonna leave me.

391
00:39:05.629 --> 00:39:06.630
Why?

392
00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.093
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

393
00:39:13.178 --> 00:39:14.828
With everything we've been doing?

394
00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:18.850
Vegas, the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

395
00:39:19.935 --> 00:39:23.313
- When you gonna get an old lady?
- When I get around to it.

396
00:39:26.191 --> 00:39:28.026
You got something else on the side?

397
00:39:29.819 --> 00:39:30.987
Nothing regular.

398
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.073
She got something else on the side?

399
00:39:34.157 --> 00:39:35.492
- No.
- You sure?

400
00:39:36.743 --> 00:39:38.286
Yeah, I'm sure.

401
00:39:40.372 --> 00:39:41.998
I don't know what you're doing.

402
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.085
Remember Jimmy McElwain
on the yard used to say,

403
00:39:46.169 --> 00:39:48.045
"You want to be making moves
on the street,

404
00:39:48.129 --> 00:39:49.630
have no attachments.

405
00:39:49.714 --> 00:39:53.968
Allow nothing to be in your life you
cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat,

406
00:39:54.052 --> 00:39:56.429
if you spot the heat around the corner."

407
00:39:56.513 --> 00:39:58.098
You remember that?

408
00:40:04.813 --> 00:40:07.857
For me, the sun rises and sets
with her, man.

409
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.277
Yeah?

410
00:40:11.403 --> 00:40:12.404
Yeah.

411
00:40:15.156 --> 00:40:16.283
Okay.

412
00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:23.998
Today, we take delivery
of cash from Van Zant.

413
00:40:24.082 --> 00:40:27.502
Then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

414
00:40:27.586 --> 00:40:28.670
Bank? What bank?

415
00:40:29.337 --> 00:40:32.048
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

416
00:40:32.132 --> 00:40:34.009
That goes, too. Then the bank.

417
00:40:38.013 --> 00:40:40.098
- Want some breakfast?
- Yeah.

418
00:40:47.105 --> 00:40:48.856
Are you okay?

419
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.317
Yeah, sugar.

420
00:40:55.822 --> 00:40:58.241
Yeah. For real.

421
00:40:58.325 --> 00:40:59.992
- Okay.
- Going to do good.

422
00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:01.661
I'll see you later.

423
00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:20.471
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.

424
00:41:20.555 --> 00:41:23.015
Grierson, my parole officer,
told me to come by here,

425
00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:24.976
said you had a job for me.

426
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.228
So you're familiar
with this kind of operation, huh?

427
00:41:27.312 --> 00:41:30.439
- Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.
- Good. Good for you.

428
00:41:30.523 --> 00:41:33.234
Here, you'll mop out the toilets,
hit the dishwasher, bus tables,

429
00:41:33.318 --> 00:41:34.777
and empty the garbage too.

430
00:41:34.861 --> 00:41:36.612
Give me a hard time, I'll report you.

431
00:41:36.696 --> 00:41:37.863
Loaded, drunk, or stealing,

432
00:41:37.947 --> 00:41:40.575
and I will violate you back so fast,
your head will spin.

433
00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:43.202
Twenty-five percent
of your take-home kicks back to me.

434
00:41:43.286 --> 00:41:46.747
Rules of the game.
Call Grierson. Check it out.

435
00:41:46.831 --> 00:41:48.166
Change in the back.

436
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.680
Well, what are you waiting for?

437
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.236
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

438
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.739
- Yeah. Roger Van Zant.
<i>- Please hold.</i>

439
00:42:23.743 --> 00:42:26.203
<i>Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.</i>

440
00:42:26.287 --> 00:42:27.830
I'm supposed to collect something?

441
00:42:27.914 --> 00:42:29.332
Give me your number

442
00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:32.366
and somebody will call you right back
from a different line.

443
00:42:32.752 --> 00:42:35.797
818-133-6089.

444
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:02.198
- Yeah.
<i>- I got a package for you.</i>

445
00:43:02.282 --> 00:43:05.201
<i>There's a drive-in on Centinela.
2:30 tomorrow.</i>

446
00:43:05.285 --> 00:43:07.287
Okay, just send one man alone.

447
00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:34.980
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

448
00:43:35.064 --> 00:43:36.649
Who the... Who...

449
00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:38.442
- Who was that guy?
- He's nobody.

450
00:43:38.526 --> 00:43:40.528
I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

451
00:43:40.612 --> 00:43:42.196
- He's nobody, Neil.
- Listen, you...

452
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.658
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas, Alan Marciano.

453
00:43:45.742 --> 00:43:48.744
- Chris gonna straighten it up with you.
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!

454
00:43:48.828 --> 00:43:49.913
Shut up!

455
00:43:51.414 --> 00:43:55.042
Here's the deal.
You will give Chris one last shot.

456
00:43:55.126 --> 00:43:59.255
After that, he fucks up, then I will
finance setting you up myself

457
00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:01.632
on my own, anywhere you want.

458
00:44:01.716 --> 00:44:04.802
Dominick will go with you.
And my word counts.

459
00:44:04.886 --> 00:44:09.015
But right now,
you will give him the chance.

460
00:44:12.811 --> 00:44:14.562
Clean up. Go home.

461
00:44:15.605 --> 00:44:16.940
Clean up. Go home.

462
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:04.278
Give me all your money.

463
00:45:04.362 --> 00:45:06.739
One day you gonna get smoked
with that shit.

464
00:45:06.823 --> 00:45:08.074
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

465
00:45:11.536 --> 00:45:13.329
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

466
00:45:13.413 --> 00:45:16.416
Yeah, got it.

467
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.237
Vincent! Hey, man!

468
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:48.447
Hey! Vincent.

469
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:51.325
Hey, Vincent, this is my brother
Richard. Richard, Vincent.

470
00:45:51.409 --> 00:45:53.244
- Richard.
- Yeah. It's all right.

471
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.205
What do you got for me?

472
00:45:56.289 --> 00:45:58.374
Before we even get into that,

473
00:45:58.458 --> 00:46:01.752
there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas.

474
00:46:01.836 --> 00:46:04.880
All right? Now, the back
of a trim shop on Irvine,

475
00:46:04.964 --> 00:46:08.509
if somebody was to pay
a little visit this weekend,

476
00:46:08.593 --> 00:46:12.513
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 slope.

477
00:46:12.597 --> 00:46:15.307
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

478
00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:18.227
Yeah? I'm a good citizen.

479
00:46:18.311 --> 00:46:20.187
I'm Donald Duck.

480
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:22.321
So, you got something to tell me or what?

481
00:46:23.608 --> 00:46:26.193
Check this out, coz.

482
00:46:26.277 --> 00:46:29.989
How do I know, if I tell you
what you need to know,

483
00:46:30.073 --> 00:46:32.783
you're gonna do what the fuck
I need to get done?

484
00:46:32.867 --> 00:46:36.620
Richard, man, Hanna's straight up.
We do business all the time.

485
00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:38.956
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

486
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.666
And you know because I say so,

487
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.837
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

488
00:46:44.921 --> 00:46:47.339
Look here, man,
you understand what I'm saying?

489
00:46:47.423 --> 00:46:49.758
I could get killed
for telling you this shit.

490
00:46:49.842 --> 00:46:51.802
You can get killed walking your doggy!

491
00:46:51.886 --> 00:46:53.762
All right, man.

492
00:46:53.846 --> 00:46:56.348
There's this cat
I was locked up with in Folsom.

493
00:46:56.432 --> 00:46:58.559
Did a couple... two, three years.

494
00:46:58.643 --> 00:47:00.687
He got out, and I ran into him.

495
00:47:03.564 --> 00:47:05.232
And so?

496
00:47:05.316 --> 00:47:07.693
He's a big fiend for action.

497
00:47:07.777 --> 00:47:11.363
Now if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing.

498
00:47:11.447 --> 00:47:13.073
But he goes on and on,

499
00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:15.242
running down to me
how he ain't been doing nothing

500
00:47:15.326 --> 00:47:18.078
and nothing's been going on
and all this other bullshit.

501
00:47:18.162 --> 00:47:23.626
So right then and there, I know
this cat's got something going down.

502
00:47:31.009 --> 00:47:32.719
Pretty fucking great.

503
00:47:34.345 --> 00:47:36.805
Albert, what's wrong with you?

504
00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:40.851
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

505
00:47:40.935 --> 00:47:44.104
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

506
00:47:44.188 --> 00:47:48.984
- That's right.
- Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

507
00:47:49.068 --> 00:47:51.487
What do you want for that,
a Junior G-Man badge?

508
00:47:51.571 --> 00:47:53.990
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

509
00:47:55.116 --> 00:47:56.325
Is he kidding me?

510
00:47:58.161 --> 00:48:01.038
Hey, I'm telling you, man. This Slick
is no motherfucking joke, man.

511
00:48:01.122 --> 00:48:02.882
You know what I'm saying?
He's double time...

512
00:48:02.915 --> 00:48:06.126
Say what? Say what?
You said "Slick." What does that mean?

513
00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.255
Slick. That's what
he calls people. "Slick."

514
00:48:10.798 --> 00:48:12.592
And tell me about him.

515
00:48:14.677 --> 00:48:16.553
About six feet tall.

516
00:48:16.637 --> 00:48:18.806
A lot of jailhouse tats.

517
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.184
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

518
00:48:23.144 --> 00:48:25.063
What's his name?

519
00:48:26.189 --> 00:48:27.856
Cheritto.

520
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.568
Michael Cheritto.

521
00:48:33.946 --> 00:48:36.657
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976,</i>

522
00:48:36.741 --> 00:48:39.159
<i>11 for armed robbery, three convictions.</i>

523
00:48:39.243 --> 00:48:42.079
<i>Two out of
a three-to-five-year beef in Attica.</i>

524
00:48:42.163 --> 00:48:43.247
Three years in Marion.

525
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:46.792
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

526
00:48:46.876 --> 00:48:50.337
<i>- Jacket's two inches thick.</i>
- Okay, who do I have there now?

527
00:48:50.421 --> 00:48:52.047
Drucker and me, boss, and Schwartz.

528
00:48:52.131 --> 00:48:54.008
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

529
00:48:54.092 --> 00:48:57.052
That's 24 hours,
round-the-clock, day and night,

530
00:48:57.136 --> 00:48:58.804
we never close, open seven days a week.

531
00:48:58.888 --> 00:49:01.223
<i>Bug the car, the house, the works.</i>

532
00:49:01.307 --> 00:49:03.142
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant,</i>

533
00:49:03.226 --> 00:49:05.894
<i>I want pictures
of who he moves and sits with.</i>

534
00:49:05.978 --> 00:49:07.438
Then you guys run makes on them.

535
00:49:07.522 --> 00:49:10.107
They got jackets, I want to see
who they move and sit with.

536
00:49:10.191 --> 00:49:14.153
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

537
00:50:08.082 --> 00:50:10.125
- Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- What?

538
00:50:10.209 --> 00:50:13.378
- Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- All right.

539
00:50:13.462 --> 00:50:16.090
I tell you what to do.
I tell you how to do it.

540
00:50:17.383 --> 00:50:21.137
Now, with your right hand only...
Your right hand only...

541
00:50:22.722 --> 00:50:24.682
Take the package and throw it in here.

542
00:50:43.201 --> 00:50:44.952
Fuck. Behind you on the right.

543
00:52:04.699 --> 00:52:06.658
Yeah. Roger Van Zant.

544
00:52:06.742 --> 00:52:07.993
Yeah. Who's this?

545
00:52:08.077 --> 00:52:09.787
You know who this is.

546
00:52:10.871 --> 00:52:12.331
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

547
00:52:12.415 --> 00:52:14.416
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

548
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.627
He didn't call. Is everything all right?

549
00:52:17.628 --> 00:52:20.255
<i>I'll tell you what. Forget the money.</i>

550
00:52:20.339 --> 00:52:21.340
What?

551
00:52:22.216 --> 00:52:24.385
Forget the money.

552
00:52:25.303 --> 00:52:27.721
Well, it's a lot of money.

553
00:52:27.805 --> 00:52:30.682
Wh-What are you doing?
What do you mean, forget the money?

554
00:52:30.766 --> 00:52:33.561
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

555
00:52:34.395 --> 00:52:35.438
I don't understand.

556
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.480
Because there is a dead man
on the other end of this fucking line.

557
00:52:59.045 --> 00:53:00.796
Oh, Michael.

558
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.214
Do you like it?

559
00:53:02.923 --> 00:53:04.216
Wow.

560
00:53:08.637 --> 00:53:10.139
Did you know about this?

561
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:13.642
You are insane.

562
00:53:18.647 --> 00:53:20.732
- You like it?
- It is beautiful.

563
00:53:20.816 --> 00:53:23.211
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Just don't ask him where he got it.

564
00:53:23.235 --> 00:53:26.530
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's what I had thought.

565
00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:35.038
What do you want to be
when you grow up, honey?

566
00:53:35.122 --> 00:53:36.165
I don't know.

567
00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:41.211
She doesn't know. Just like me.

568
00:53:41.295 --> 00:53:42.588
I don't know either.

569
00:53:57.311 --> 00:53:58.520
Hello.

570
00:53:58.604 --> 00:54:00.605
Hi. It's me.

571
00:54:00.689 --> 00:54:03.776
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

572
00:54:05.653 --> 00:54:08.613
I've been busy. Can I see you?

573
00:54:08.697 --> 00:54:10.783
I was afraid that was just

574
00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:13.786
the one night, you know?

575
00:54:14.495 --> 00:54:16.580
No, not for me it wasn't.

576
00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:20.292
Yeah, me neither.

577
00:54:22.586 --> 00:54:24.380
Can I fall by?

578
00:54:25.256 --> 00:54:26.381
Yeah.

579
00:54:26.465 --> 00:54:28.717
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

580
00:54:43.441 --> 00:54:45.943
Goddamn convention.

581
00:54:46.902 --> 00:54:49.154
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

582
00:54:49.238 --> 00:54:50.572
We got two transmitters.

583
00:54:50.656 --> 00:54:53.784
One's in the wheel well.
Backup's in the fire wall.

584
00:54:53.868 --> 00:54:56.954
- Oh, here we are.
- Did you say good night to Neil?

585
00:54:57.872 --> 00:54:59.915
The one with the blond hair
is Chris Shiherlis.

586
00:54:59.999 --> 00:55:03.502
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

587
00:55:05.588 --> 00:55:09.049
Cheritto has cruised the precious metals
depository three times.

588
00:55:09.133 --> 00:55:11.510
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

589
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.263
Sammy and I think that's going
to be their next score.

590
00:55:15.347 --> 00:55:16.348
Who's the loner?

591
00:55:19.727 --> 00:55:23.063
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

592
00:55:24.857 --> 00:55:26.692
Well, get on it.

593
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:37.369
Okay.

594
00:55:44.418 --> 00:55:46.962
When these guys walk out the door

595
00:55:47.046 --> 00:55:49.840
of whatever score
they're gonna take next,

596
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:54.094
they're gonna have
the surprise of a lifetime.

597
00:56:10.027 --> 00:56:11.862
Hey, baby, time to go.

598
00:56:12.988 --> 00:56:15.657
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

599
00:56:15.741 --> 00:56:17.117
Oh, yeah.

600
00:56:18.994 --> 00:56:22.248
You fly. You cool.

601
00:56:29.171 --> 00:56:30.714
You're lying to me.

602
00:56:30.798 --> 00:56:33.592
I can always tell when people lie to me.

603
00:56:33.676 --> 00:56:35.886
Hon, I ain't lying.

604
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.762
You a hot dog,

605
00:56:37.846 --> 00:56:40.515
a regular rodeo rider,

606
00:56:40.599 --> 00:56:44.061
and this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

607
00:56:48.107 --> 00:56:51.067
Now I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

608
00:56:51.151 --> 00:56:53.236
You don't have a truth-telling style.

609
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.155
What are you talking about?

610
00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:57.283
You don't know what this is.

611
00:57:03.539 --> 00:57:06.250
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

612
00:57:25.144 --> 00:57:26.562
So where you been?

613
00:57:28.272 --> 00:57:32.067
SHU at Pelican Bay and Folsom B-wing.

614
00:57:33.027 --> 00:57:37.239
I am a cowboy,
looking for anything heavy.

615
00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:39.241
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

616
00:57:40.117 --> 00:57:42.077
That is why I am here.

617
00:57:48.917 --> 00:57:50.752
Why don't you...

618
00:57:50.836 --> 00:57:53.922
Why don't you call this guy?

619
00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.051
This guy's always putting guys on.

620
00:58:01.221 --> 00:58:02.222
Thank you, brother.

621
00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:13.233
What's so funny?

622
00:58:13.317 --> 00:58:14.943
It's really dumb.

623
00:58:15.027 --> 00:58:16.653
You smell pretty.

624
00:58:16.737 --> 00:58:18.321
You two are perfect for each other.

625
00:58:18.405 --> 00:58:20.824
How did you meet?

626
00:58:24.453 --> 00:58:26.705
I knew this guy in grade school.

627
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:28.623
His name was Raul...

628
00:58:28.707 --> 00:58:31.293
Whatever. Anyway,
the guy could take his fingers, right,

629
00:58:31.377 --> 00:58:32.961
and fold them over, one over the other,

630
00:58:33.045 --> 00:58:34.879
and then he'd turn his eyelids
inside out.

631
00:58:34.963 --> 00:58:38.175
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

632
00:58:39.134 --> 00:58:44.056
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

633
00:58:48.644 --> 00:58:50.187
Woman.

634
00:58:54.858 --> 00:58:56.443
Oh.

635
00:58:56.527 --> 00:58:58.612
This better be earth-shattering.

636
00:59:04.785 --> 00:59:06.703
To Raul.

637
00:59:06.787 --> 00:59:08.913
- Raul.
- To Raul.

638
00:59:08.997 --> 00:59:10.708
Yeah. Vincent Hanna.

639
00:59:53.083 --> 00:59:54.877
Here's how we found her.

640
00:59:59.214 --> 01:00:00.215
How old?

641
01:00:00.299 --> 01:00:04.010
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

642
01:00:04.094 --> 01:00:05.679
How'd she die, Rachel?

643
01:00:05.763 --> 01:00:09.141
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

644
01:00:10.267 --> 01:00:11.810
Who did this?

645
01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.103
Who's that?

646
01:00:13.187 --> 01:00:15.939
- Mother and siblings, I guess.
- What the hell they doing here?

647
01:00:16.023 --> 01:00:19.773
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

648
01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:22.237
Okay, let's go.

649
01:00:26.533 --> 01:00:27.910
Nice.

650
01:00:28.827 --> 01:00:30.745
When I run a DNA check on the semen,

651
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:32.956
my intuition says
it's coming up the same guy,

652
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.209
so it's a series,
and ending up in your court.

653
01:00:36.293 --> 01:00:38.128
Sheriff's Homicide getting
anywhere on theirs?

654
01:00:38.212 --> 01:00:39.379
Not yet.

655
01:00:40.714 --> 01:00:42.382
- Get her.
- Get off me. Get off of me!

656
01:00:42.466 --> 01:00:44.092
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

657
01:00:45.177 --> 01:00:46.761
- Oh, my God!
- Hold it, hold it.

658
01:00:46.845 --> 01:00:48.931
Oh, my God!

659
01:00:50.682 --> 01:00:53.644
- Where is she?
- Easy, easy, easy.

660
01:00:56.772 --> 01:00:58.732
Okay. It's okay.

661
01:01:01.318 --> 01:01:02.819
It's okay. It's okay.

662
01:01:02.903 --> 01:01:04.487
Who did this?

663
01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:07.366
Where's my baby? Where is she?

664
01:01:08.116 --> 01:01:10.911
I need to know what happened.

665
01:01:52.661 --> 01:01:54.705
I guess the earth shattered.

666
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:58.834
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
01:02:00.377 --> 01:02:02.921
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

668
01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:04.214
What was it?

669
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.675
You don't want to know.

670
01:02:07.759 --> 01:02:10.929
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
01:02:11.013 --> 01:02:13.765
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

672
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:17.227
You never told me I'd be excluded.

673
01:02:18.645 --> 01:02:20.939
I told you when we hooked up, baby,

674
01:02:21.023 --> 01:02:23.316
that you were gonna have to share me

675
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.070
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:02:27.154 --> 01:02:31.783
And I bought into that sharing
because I love you.

677
01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:35.703
I love you fat, bald,
money, no money, driving a bus.

678
01:02:35.787 --> 01:02:37.331
I don't care.

679
01:02:38.206 --> 01:02:41.042
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

680
01:02:41.126 --> 01:02:44.087
That's sharing.
This is not sharing. This is leftovers.

681
01:02:44.171 --> 01:02:46.965
I see. What I should do is
come home and say,

682
01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:49.759
"Hi, honey. Guess what."

683
01:02:49.843 --> 01:02:52.679
I walked into this house today
where this junkie asshole

684
01:02:52.763 --> 01:02:56.891
just fried his baby in a microwave
because it was crying too loud,

685
01:02:56.975 --> 01:02:58.810
so let me share that with you.

686
01:02:58.894 --> 01:03:00.562
Come on. Let's share that.

687
01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:04.065
And in sharing it, we'll somehow, uh,

688
01:03:04.149 --> 01:03:06.860
"cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

689
01:03:06.944 --> 01:03:07.945
Right?

690
01:03:10.572 --> 01:03:13.032
Wrong. You know why?

691
01:03:13.116 --> 01:03:15.368
Because you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:03:15.452 --> 01:03:17.662
We fuck, then you lose
the power of speech.

693
01:03:17.746 --> 01:03:20.540
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

694
01:03:20.624 --> 01:03:23.376
I preserve it, because I need it.

695
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.587
It keeps me sharp, on the edge,

696
01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:27.339
where I gotta be.

697
01:03:34.638 --> 01:03:36.348
You don't live with me.

698
01:03:38.976 --> 01:03:41.478
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.817
You read the terrain.

700
01:03:48.527 --> 01:03:51.446
You search for signs of passing,

701
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.698
for the scent of your prey,

702
01:03:53.782 --> 01:03:55.492
and then you hunt them down.

703
01:03:57.411 --> 01:03:59.955
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

704
01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:06.169
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

705
01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:14.720
What I don't understand
is why I can't cut loose of you.

706
01:04:30.777 --> 01:04:33.113
Hey, it's Lilly.

707
01:04:34.781 --> 01:04:36.366
Let's go, baby.

708
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:42.622
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

709
01:04:43.707 --> 01:04:45.750
Did time for what
that motherfucker does every day.

710
01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:51.255
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

711
01:04:51.339 --> 01:04:53.425
Can you do that?

712
01:04:55.343 --> 01:04:57.971
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

713
01:05:04.311 --> 01:05:06.271
What you hanging with me for, Lilly?

714
01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.858
Because I'm proud of you.

715
01:05:15.906 --> 01:05:18.533
- You're proud of me?
- Mm-hmm.

716
01:05:22.329 --> 01:05:24.331
What the hell you proud of me for?

717
01:05:25.791 --> 01:05:27.292
Come on home.

718
01:05:38.303 --> 01:05:40.013
What were you doing there?

719
01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:44.225
I was skiing. I was trying to ski.

720
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:45.601
That's what people do there.

721
01:05:45.685 --> 01:05:50.231
You go skiing, and you, um...
you meet people.

722
01:05:50.315 --> 01:05:51.774
You try to have a good time.

723
01:05:51.858 --> 01:05:53.609
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

724
01:05:53.693 --> 01:05:54.902
Why not?

725
01:05:54.986 --> 01:05:57.655
I'm not good at meeting people.

726
01:05:57.739 --> 01:05:58.949
You met me.

727
01:05:59.783 --> 01:06:02.577
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it,

728
01:06:02.661 --> 01:06:04.371
which is why, probably.

729
01:06:05.372 --> 01:06:07.415
No. It's because you are fine.

730
01:06:10.085 --> 01:06:11.503
Eady...

731
01:06:12.754 --> 01:06:15.215
Take off with me for a while.

732
01:06:16.007 --> 01:06:17.008
Where?

733
01:06:17.092 --> 01:06:18.551
New Zealand.

734
01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:21.346
When?

735
01:06:22.973 --> 01:06:25.475
I have to go separate.
You could meet me there.

736
01:06:26.184 --> 01:06:27.685
But my job, my...

737
01:06:27.769 --> 01:06:29.979
I got money. You don't need money.

738
01:06:30.063 --> 01:06:32.149
You could set up a studio, do work there.

739
01:06:33.024 --> 01:06:35.735
- I don't know.
- What's there to know?

740
01:06:35.819 --> 01:06:37.279
Are you married?

741
01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.573
- What?
- You come and go.

742
01:06:40.657 --> 01:06:42.200
The last thing I am is married.

743
01:06:42.284 --> 01:06:45.495
I'm a needle starting at zero,
going the other way, a double blank.

744
01:06:45.579 --> 01:06:47.164
Then all of a sudden

745
01:06:48.206 --> 01:06:50.083
someone like you comes along.

746
01:06:53.753 --> 01:06:56.339
- You don't know me, Neil.
- I know enough.

747
01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.720
Come with me.

748
01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:13.481
What's wrong, baby?

749
01:07:14.941 --> 01:07:17.569
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

750
01:07:22.657 --> 01:07:23.825
Yeah.

751
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.538
Good.

752
01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:56.065
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

753
01:07:56.149 --> 01:07:58.799
What happened?
You forget your mom was picking you up?

754
01:08:00.362 --> 01:08:01.571
No.

755
01:08:03.365 --> 01:08:05.158
So, what's going on?

756
01:08:07.118 --> 01:08:08.745
I felt like being alone.

757
01:08:11.414 --> 01:08:13.583
Okay, come on. I'll drive you home.

758
01:08:18.797 --> 01:08:21.716
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi, Lauren.

759
01:09:10.557 --> 01:09:11.558
What's happening?

760
01:09:13.351 --> 01:09:14.644
Lieutenant, sir.

761
01:09:14.728 --> 01:09:17.271
Captain Jackson wants
to know what's going on.

762
01:09:17.355 --> 01:09:20.567
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

763
01:10:14.662 --> 01:10:15.872
Technique.

764
01:10:35.558 --> 01:10:37.894
Open sesame. Right there.

765
01:11:35.243 --> 01:11:36.327
There.

766
01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:40.933
- We walk.
- I'm right there.

767
01:12:41.017 --> 01:12:42.477
We walk now! Come on.

768
01:12:54.656 --> 01:12:58.535
He's heard it. He's heard it.

769
01:13:07.168 --> 01:13:08.503
Heads up.

770
01:13:10.046 --> 01:13:12.047
- One's coming out.
- Just hold it, Captain.

771
01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:14.592
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

772
01:13:14.676 --> 01:13:15.677
Yeah, I see.

773
01:13:19.013 --> 01:13:21.140
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

774
01:13:21.224 --> 01:13:23.726
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

775
01:13:32.777 --> 01:13:34.570
- Okay, let them go.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

776
01:13:34.654 --> 01:13:36.006
<i>- We can take them!</i>
- What? On what?

777
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:38.259
What are you going to take them on?
Breaking and entering?

778
01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.284
They didn't steal anything yet.
Don't you get it?

779
01:13:40.368 --> 01:13:42.870
It gets knocked back
to some chickenshit misdemeanor.

780
01:13:42.954 --> 01:13:45.331
They do six months, and they're out.
No fucking way.

781
01:13:45.415 --> 01:13:47.851
I'm not taking the heat from my bosses
'cause you let them go.

782
01:13:47.875 --> 01:13:50.187
- They're not walking.
- That's exactly what they're gonna do.

783
01:13:50.211 --> 01:13:52.338
They're gonna walk.
This is my operation.

784
01:13:52.422 --> 01:13:55.216
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

785
01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.801
They will walk away,
and you will let them.

786
01:13:57.885 --> 01:13:59.345
Fuck!

787
01:14:44.432 --> 01:14:46.559
Back to work.

788
01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:51.564
LAPD. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

789
01:14:51.648 --> 01:14:54.858
Maybe it's the score they were on to.
The place, not us.

790
01:14:54.942 --> 01:14:57.611
'Cause it's been hit a couple of times,
you know, something?

791
01:14:57.695 --> 01:14:59.863
Assume they got our phones.
Assume they got our houses.

792
01:14:59.947 --> 01:15:02.616
Assume they got us
right here, right now as we sit.

793
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.702
Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:15:04.786 --> 01:15:06.912
How are we gonna buy
the bank package from Kelso?

795
01:15:06.996 --> 01:15:08.664
I'll front that. That's not a problem.

796
01:15:08.748 --> 01:15:10.874
What the hell happens
to Van Zant and our 750?

797
01:15:10.958 --> 01:15:12.436
Van Zant. Listen, with the heat we got,

798
01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:14.480
you wanna play World War I I
in the streets with Van Zant?

799
01:15:14.504 --> 01:15:16.547
No, I want my 750. What, he gets a pass?

800
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:19.675
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you.

801
01:15:19.759 --> 01:15:21.218
He is a fucking luxury.

802
01:15:21.302 --> 01:15:23.887
Our problem is take the bank
or split right now.

803
01:15:23.971 --> 01:15:26.432
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

804
01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:29.768
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

805
01:15:29.852 --> 01:15:32.105
That's it. Chris.

806
01:15:36.025 --> 01:15:38.193
The bank is worth the risk.

807
01:15:38.277 --> 01:15:39.570
I need it, brother.

808
01:15:41.447 --> 01:15:44.450
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

809
01:15:55.628 --> 01:15:58.881
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

810
01:15:58.965 --> 01:16:01.926
Not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

811
01:16:14.814 --> 01:16:16.983
You figure this is the best thing to do?

812
01:16:17.734 --> 01:16:21.654
- This is the best thing to do?
- I got plans. I'm going away after this.

813
01:16:21.738 --> 01:16:23.781
So for me, the reward
is maybe worth the stretch.

814
01:16:23.865 --> 01:16:26.825
But Elaine takes good care of you,
you got plenty put away,

815
01:16:26.909 --> 01:16:28.577
you got T-bonds, real estate.

816
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:31.706
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

817
01:16:49.515 --> 01:16:53.686
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

818
01:16:54.437 --> 01:16:55.438
I'm in.

819
01:17:00.276 --> 01:17:02.528
- You too?
- Yeah, sure.

820
01:17:02.612 --> 01:17:04.780
Let's go.

821
01:17:04.864 --> 01:17:06.782
Fuck 'em! Let's do it.

822
01:17:06.866 --> 01:17:09.216
All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

823
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:25.092
- You can't go in there.
- Watch this.

824
01:17:25.176 --> 01:17:27.428
- Excuse me. Hey, wait.
- Uh, Tim, I gotta call you back.

825
01:17:27.512 --> 01:17:29.552
- You have to have an appointment!
- May I help you?

826
01:17:29.597 --> 01:17:32.516
- Are you Alan Marciano?
- Yeah. And who the fuck are you?

827
01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.600
Who am I?

828
01:17:33.684 --> 01:17:36.854
- Hey! Hey!
- Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

829
01:17:36.938 --> 01:17:40.274
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here!

830
01:17:40.358 --> 01:17:43.819
Hey, hey. I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around.

831
01:17:43.903 --> 01:17:45.696
But I know people here, okay?

832
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.242
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

833
01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:53.078
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant

834
01:17:53.162 --> 01:17:56.331
for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago,

835
01:17:56.415 --> 01:17:58.709
or you go to work for us.

836
01:17:58.793 --> 01:18:02.004
Cut and dried. That is it.

837
01:18:02.088 --> 01:18:03.589
Oh, shit.

838
01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:06.633
Charlene Shiherlis.

839
01:18:06.717 --> 01:18:07.718
Who?

840
01:18:07.802 --> 01:18:10.763
"Who? Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

841
01:18:10.847 --> 01:18:12.806
The lady you've been talking dirty to

842
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:14.975
on the telephone every day the last week.

843
01:18:15.059 --> 01:18:17.204
Yeah, all right. You know what?
You can't tie me to her.

844
01:18:17.228 --> 01:18:21.231
Well, who needs to? Because your ass is
on a plane back to New Jersey, jag-off.

845
01:18:21.315 --> 01:18:22.859
Oh, man, I just...

846
01:18:23.818 --> 01:18:25.360
Why'd I get mixed up with that bitch?

847
01:18:25.444 --> 01:18:28.239
'Cause she got a... great ass!

848
01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.910
And you've got your head
all the way up it!

849
01:18:32.994 --> 01:18:34.495
Jesus.

850
01:18:36.622 --> 01:18:38.791
When I think of asses,

851
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.751
a woman's ass,

852
01:18:40.835 --> 01:18:42.503
something comes out of me.

853
01:18:44.463 --> 01:18:46.674
- So?
- So, no big thing.

854
01:18:47.508 --> 01:18:51.970
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:18:52.054 --> 01:18:54.504
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

856
01:18:58.895 --> 01:19:01.897
- San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
- Uh-huh.

857
01:19:01.981 --> 01:19:04.775
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:19:04.859 --> 01:19:08.154
Right. The security systems
around here are a joke.

859
01:19:13.367 --> 01:19:16.217
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge.
That's escape route number one.

860
01:19:16.871 --> 01:19:20.207
Number two, over here.
Anaheim to the 110.

861
01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:21.291
Good.

862
01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:22.626
- Okay?
- Yeah, that's nice.

863
01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:24.587
Got it? Good. Let's go.

864
01:19:47.318 --> 01:19:48.568
They were looking back

865
01:19:50.112 --> 01:19:51.530
in this direction.

866
01:19:52.448 --> 01:19:54.241
A container facility?

867
01:19:54.325 --> 01:19:55.742
What? Cartage theft?

868
01:19:55.826 --> 01:19:58.955
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

869
01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:05.043
Next door's an oil refinery.
Over there's a scrapyard.

870
01:20:05.127 --> 01:20:07.880
Refinery only pays by check.
No cash around.

871
01:20:07.964 --> 01:20:09.715
Same for the scrapyard.

872
01:20:13.135 --> 01:20:14.685
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

873
01:20:18.808 --> 01:20:21.352
A refinery and a scrapyard.

874
01:20:22.311 --> 01:20:25.940
- What the hell is going on?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

875
01:20:26.983 --> 01:20:28.150
We thought we had it.

876
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.736
Thought we had it.

877
01:20:40.496 --> 01:20:41.998
I got an idea

878
01:20:43.082 --> 01:20:45.418
of what they were looking at.

879
01:20:48.587 --> 01:20:51.215
- Wanna know what they're looking at?
- What?

880
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:55.428
I mean, is this guy something
or is he something?

881
01:20:57.179 --> 01:20:59.306
This crew is good.

882
01:21:01.058 --> 01:21:02.708
You know what they're looking at?

883
01:21:03.769 --> 01:21:04.979
What?

884
01:21:06.188 --> 01:21:07.231
Us.

885
01:21:08.774 --> 01:21:12.611
The LAPD. The police department.

886
01:21:14.113 --> 01:21:15.448
We just got made.

887
01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:24.790
Yeah!

888
01:21:33.382 --> 01:21:34.800
Okay.

889
01:21:44.018 --> 01:21:45.561
Okay, motherfucker!

890
01:22:06.499 --> 01:22:07.833
Kelso come through?

891
01:22:07.917 --> 01:22:10.628
Yeah.
You can build a bank with these.

892
01:22:16.842 --> 01:22:20.053
The name is Hanna. First name, Vincent.

893
01:22:20.137 --> 01:22:22.681
I smeared this sergeant
in Vice five yards.

894
01:22:22.765 --> 01:22:24.599
Hanna's all over you.

895
01:22:24.683 --> 01:22:27.894
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis.

896
01:22:27.978 --> 01:22:30.355
Not yours.
They've been losing you at night.

897
01:22:30.439 --> 01:22:34.609
Hanna's a hot dog.
Graduate school, Marine Corps.

898
01:22:34.693 --> 01:22:36.778
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

899
01:22:36.862 --> 01:22:38.196
He's taken down some heavy crews.

900
01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.034
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago,
and he was a fucking maniac.

901
01:22:42.868 --> 01:22:44.912
He was working Narcotics before that.

902
01:22:45.746 --> 01:22:48.081
Had some problems. Divorced twice.
Current wife's Justine.

903
01:22:48.165 --> 01:22:49.750
He's why the extra heat.

904
01:22:52.503 --> 01:22:54.088
The Vice sergeant

905
01:22:55.548 --> 01:22:57.091
says Hanna likes you.

906
01:22:58.509 --> 01:23:01.845
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

907
01:23:01.929 --> 01:23:04.557
Look how sharp this guy is
to figure that.

908
01:23:06.976 --> 01:23:09.186
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

909
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:12.270
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

910
01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:15.400
It means the man is
one of those guys out there,

911
01:23:15.484 --> 01:23:17.862
prowling around all night, dedicated.

912
01:23:20.656 --> 01:23:22.956
With this guy, this much heat,
you should pass.

913
01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:31.625
It's worth the stretch.

914
01:23:32.877 --> 01:23:35.253
This guy can hit or miss.

915
01:23:35.337 --> 01:23:36.839
You can't miss once.

916
01:23:37.756 --> 01:23:39.591
You sure?

917
01:23:39.675 --> 01:23:41.260
I am sure.

918
01:23:47.391 --> 01:23:48.601
Let's go to the garage.

919
01:24:02.156 --> 01:24:03.741
Justine!

920
01:24:09.538 --> 01:24:10.789
Justine!

921
01:24:17.379 --> 01:24:18.547
Where are we going?

922
01:24:24.136 --> 01:24:27.223
- Okay, where are you going?
- Out.

923
01:25:25.531 --> 01:25:26.823
What are they on?

924
01:25:26.907 --> 01:25:28.534
Tac 9.

925
01:25:29.576 --> 01:25:32.579
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.</i>

926
01:25:32.663 --> 01:25:34.415
<i>We got four ground units and air.</i>

927
01:25:52.516 --> 01:25:55.310
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

928
01:25:55.394 --> 01:25:57.646
<i>Hey, Vincent, it's J.J. I'm in Air 40.</i>

929
01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:59.397
<i>Richie Glover's with me.</i>

930
01:25:59.481 --> 01:26:03.526
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound,
approaching the 110 interchange.</i>

931
01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:05.570
You running a revolving tail?

932
01:26:05.654 --> 01:26:08.573
<i>Yeah. I got two units in front,
three behind.</i>

933
01:26:08.657 --> 01:26:12.077
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

934
01:26:12.953 --> 01:26:14.371
Let's go.

935
01:27:04.421 --> 01:27:08.383
Am I a hundred yards, or what?
Am I close or far or what?

936
01:27:08.467 --> 01:27:10.427
<i>300 yards, center lane.</i>

937
01:28:17.327 --> 01:28:18.871
How you doing?

938
01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:25.335
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

939
01:28:31.884 --> 01:28:33.177
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

940
01:28:33.969 --> 01:28:35.179
Follow me.

941
01:28:51.028 --> 01:28:55.407
Seven years in Folsom.
In the hole for three.

942
01:28:55.491 --> 01:28:56.867
McNeil before that.

943
01:29:00.412 --> 01:29:02.164
McNeil as tough as they say?

944
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:05.542
You looking to become a penologist?

945
01:29:06.752 --> 01:29:08.628
You looking to go back?

946
01:29:08.712 --> 01:29:12.799
I've chased down some crews' guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

947
01:29:12.883 --> 01:29:14.092
That you?

948
01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.471
You must have worked some dipshit crews.

949
01:29:18.305 --> 01:29:19.848
I worked all kinds.

950
01:29:23.644 --> 01:29:25.687
You see me doing thrill-seeker
liquor store holdups

951
01:29:25.771 --> 01:29:28.690
with a "born to lose" tattoo on my chest?

952
01:29:28.774 --> 01:29:30.984
- No, I do not.
- Right.

953
01:29:32.736 --> 01:29:34.530
I am never going back.

954
01:29:36.198 --> 01:29:38.367
Then don't take down scores.

955
01:29:39.618 --> 01:29:42.245
I do what I do best. I take scores.

956
01:29:42.329 --> 01:29:45.249
You do what you do best...
Tryin' to stop guys like me.

957
01:29:49.294 --> 01:29:51.338
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

958
01:29:52.256 --> 01:29:55.217
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

959
01:29:56.969 --> 01:29:58.053
Yeah.

960
01:30:00.639 --> 01:30:02.589
This regular-type life, that your life?

961
01:30:03.267 --> 01:30:05.394
My life? No. My life...

962
01:30:06.728 --> 01:30:08.647
No, my life's a disaster zone.

963
01:30:10.482 --> 01:30:13.318
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up

964
01:30:13.402 --> 01:30:16.488
because her real father's
this large-type asshole.

965
01:30:16.572 --> 01:30:18.448
I got a wife.

966
01:30:18.532 --> 01:30:22.035
We're passing each other on
the downslope of a marriage... my third.

967
01:30:24.079 --> 01:30:27.874
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

968
01:30:27.958 --> 01:30:29.459
That's my life.

969
01:30:35.757 --> 01:30:37.342
Guy told me one time...

970
01:30:39.428 --> 01:30:41.179
don't let yourself
get attached to anything

971
01:30:41.263 --> 01:30:43.973
you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat

972
01:30:44.057 --> 01:30:46.143
if you feel the heat around the corner.

973
01:30:47.853 --> 01:30:51.231
Now, if you're on me
and you gotta move when I move,

974
01:30:51.315 --> 01:30:54.484
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

975
01:30:56.194 --> 01:30:57.904
Well, that's an interesting point.

976
01:30:59.573 --> 01:31:00.824
What are you, a monk?

977
01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:03.952
I have a woman.

978
01:31:04.036 --> 01:31:05.370
What do you tell her?

979
01:31:07.831 --> 01:31:10.000
I tell her I'm a salesman.

980
01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.343
So then, if you spot me
coming around that corner,

981
01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.310
you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

982
01:31:23.847 --> 01:31:25.390
Not say goodbye?

983
01:31:26.308 --> 01:31:28.601
That's the discipline.

984
01:31:28.685 --> 01:31:30.770
That's pretty vacant, no?

985
01:31:30.854 --> 01:31:32.564
Yeah, it is what it is.

986
01:31:32.648 --> 01:31:35.348
It's that, or we both
better go do something else, pal.

987
01:31:37.361 --> 01:31:39.211
I don't know how to do anything else.

988
01:31:39.863 --> 01:31:41.156
Neither do I.

989
01:31:44.076 --> 01:31:45.535
I don't much want to either.

990
01:31:46.495 --> 01:31:47.621
Neither do I.

991
01:31:55.295 --> 01:31:59.132
You know, I have
this, uh, recurring dream.

992
01:31:59.216 --> 01:32:01.926
I'm sitting at this big banquet table,

993
01:32:02.010 --> 01:32:06.514
and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table,

994
01:32:06.598 --> 01:32:11.060
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs

995
01:32:11.144 --> 01:32:13.938
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages

996
01:32:14.022 --> 01:32:16.399
from the head wounds.

997
01:32:16.483 --> 01:32:20.153
And there they are,
these big balloon people,

998
01:32:20.237 --> 01:32:23.337
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

999
01:32:24.074 --> 01:32:26.535
The neighbors reported the smell.

1000
01:32:27.494 --> 01:32:30.872
And there they are,
all of them, just sitting there.

1001
01:32:33.083 --> 01:32:34.209
What do they say?

1002
01:32:36.211 --> 01:32:37.211
Nothing.

1003
01:32:37.295 --> 01:32:40.382
- No talk?
- No. Just...

1004
01:32:41.174 --> 01:32:43.260
They don't have anything to say.

1005
01:32:43.969 --> 01:32:45.679
See, we just look at each other.

1006
01:32:46.763 --> 01:32:49.766
They look at me, and that's it.

1007
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:51.893
That's the dream.

1008
01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.731
I have one where I'm drowning,

1009
01:32:56.732 --> 01:33:00.235
and I gotta wake myself up and
start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1010
01:33:02.404 --> 01:33:03.780
You know what that's about?

1011
01:33:03.864 --> 01:33:07.033
Yeah. Having enough time.

1012
01:33:08.493 --> 01:33:11.871
Enough time...
to do what you want to do?

1013
01:33:11.955 --> 01:33:13.373
That's right.

1014
01:33:15.751 --> 01:33:17.377
You doing it now?

1015
01:33:17.461 --> 01:33:18.754
No. Not yet.

1016
01:33:24.259 --> 01:33:26.052
You know, we're sitting here...

1017
01:33:27.763 --> 01:33:29.847
You and I
are like a couple of regular fellas.

1018
01:33:29.931 --> 01:33:32.601
You do what you do.
I do what I gotta do.

1019
01:33:34.895 --> 01:33:37.856
And now that we've been face-to-face...

1020
01:33:40.192 --> 01:33:43.069
if I'm there and I gotta put you away,

1021
01:33:43.153 --> 01:33:44.654
I won't like it.

1022
01:33:45.572 --> 01:33:46.656
But I'll tell you...

1023
01:33:49.284 --> 01:33:52.787
if it's between you and some poor bastard

1024
01:33:52.871 --> 01:33:55.415
whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow,

1025
01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:59.920
brother, you are going down.

1026
01:34:12.349 --> 01:34:14.392
There's a flip side to that coin.

1027
01:34:16.853 --> 01:34:19.647
What if you do got me boxed in,

1028
01:34:19.731 --> 01:34:21.233
and I gotta put you down?

1029
01:34:22.526 --> 01:34:26.613
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

1030
01:34:27.781 --> 01:34:30.200
We've been face-to-face, yeah.

1031
01:34:33.537 --> 01:34:36.957
But I will not hesitate,
not for a second.

1032
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:44.714
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

1033
01:34:47.467 --> 01:34:50.845
Or, who knows?

1034
01:34:50.929 --> 01:34:54.015
Well, maybe we'll never
see each other again.

1035
01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:10.740
They dumped us.

1036
01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:12.701
What?

1037
01:35:13.535 --> 01:35:14.870
They dumped us.

1038
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.664
- What do you mean, they dumped us?
- Chris slipped his tail.

1039
01:35:18.748 --> 01:35:20.875
He doesn't talk about
their scores with Charlene,

1040
01:35:20.959 --> 01:35:23.586
so there's nothing for me
to get from Marciano... I just tried.

1041
01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:26.047
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1042
01:35:26.131 --> 01:35:28.925
Transponders got put
on a bus to San Clemente.

1043
01:35:31.469 --> 01:35:33.387
They dumped all our surveillance?

1044
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:35.849
Yeah. At the same time... 9:00 p.m.

1045
01:35:36.933 --> 01:35:40.436
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1046
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.897
- We were on you.
- Then McCauley drives into LAX,

1047
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:45.858
where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

1048
01:35:45.942 --> 01:35:48.653
His car's still there. He's gone.

1049
01:35:53.867 --> 01:35:56.702
Does anybody have any idea

1050
01:35:56.786 --> 01:35:58.872
where the fuck these people are?

1051
01:36:57.263 --> 01:36:59.057
You hear from him yet?

1052
01:37:00.183 --> 01:37:02.810
Not a thing,
and not hearing bothers me more.

1053
01:37:02.894 --> 01:37:04.354
Where is this guy?

1054
01:37:06.898 --> 01:37:10.860
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

1055
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:17.701
Who are you?

1056
01:37:19.035 --> 01:37:22.747
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

1057
01:37:22.831 --> 01:37:24.631
I've been living in this office
day and night.

1058
01:37:24.708 --> 01:37:25.958
How well do you know him?

1059
01:37:27.377 --> 01:37:30.380
Oh, we took some major scores together.

1060
01:37:33.758 --> 01:37:38.220
- How come I haven't heard from him?
- Well, he's probably busy right now.

1061
01:37:38.304 --> 01:37:39.806
But he's real thorough.

1062
01:37:41.224 --> 01:37:43.351
He ain't gonna forget about you.

1063
01:37:43.435 --> 01:37:45.061
Oh, that's reassuring.

1064
01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.607
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

1065
01:37:50.525 --> 01:37:53.445
Probably be a big help to you.

1066
01:38:14.382 --> 01:38:15.842
You recognize the grill man?

1067
01:38:23.933 --> 01:38:25.476
- No.
- Folsom.

1068
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.271
D block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1069
01:38:29.647 --> 01:38:33.651
- I ain't got my break yet, man.
- Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1070
01:38:33.735 --> 01:38:36.570
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1071
01:38:36.654 --> 01:38:38.739
Take your break later.

1072
01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:40.491
Piece of shit.

1073
01:38:40.575 --> 01:38:41.826
Pick up!

1074
01:38:44.954 --> 01:38:46.289
Where the hell is he?

1075
01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.208
I wanna check the slot for a work car.

1076
01:38:49.292 --> 01:38:50.293
So did I.

1077
01:38:54.881 --> 01:38:56.466
Yeah?

1078
01:38:58.093 --> 01:38:59.135
Hang on.

1079
01:38:59.969 --> 01:39:01.012
Yeah?

1080
01:39:01.096 --> 01:39:03.472
Hey. Use the landline.

1081
01:39:03.556 --> 01:39:06.767
Call me at 103-7206.

1082
01:39:06.851 --> 01:39:08.061
All right.

1083
01:39:18.863 --> 01:39:19.864
Where are you?

1084
01:39:19.948 --> 01:39:23.048
There's cops all over me, man.
They're on me like a cheap suit.

1085
01:39:23.743 --> 01:39:25.203
I can't dump 'em.

1086
01:39:27.664 --> 01:39:29.373
They hip to the fact you spotted them?

1087
01:39:29.457 --> 01:39:31.668
No. No, they're doing parallels.

1088
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:38.340
- I can try to dump 'em again.
<i>- How are we gonna know if you did?</i>

1089
01:39:38.424 --> 01:39:40.324
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1090
01:39:41.010 --> 01:39:42.928
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1091
01:39:43.012 --> 01:39:44.847
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1092
01:39:44.931 --> 01:39:47.058
Last thing I wanted to do
is let you down.

1093
01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:13.877
Pick up.

1094
01:40:15.378 --> 01:40:18.214
Hey! Neil, man. What up?

1095
01:40:18.298 --> 01:40:21.258
- What's up, brother?
- What you doing here?

1096
01:40:21.342 --> 01:40:23.052
What I'm doing is
I am looking for a driver

1097
01:40:23.136 --> 01:40:26.388
who can handle the scanners
and a radio, right now, today.

1098
01:40:26.472 --> 01:40:28.099
You remember the drill?

1099
01:40:28.183 --> 01:40:29.517
Yeah, man. Sure.

1100
01:40:29.601 --> 01:40:31.018
You cool?

1101
01:40:31.102 --> 01:40:33.604
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1102
01:40:33.688 --> 01:40:36.399
One answer. Yes or no. Right now.

1103
01:40:50.455 --> 01:40:53.374
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1104
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:56.211
Out back in five.

1105
01:41:06.346 --> 01:41:08.389
What's burning?
What's burning? <i>¿Que quema?</i>

1106
01:41:08.473 --> 01:41:10.266
What is this?

1107
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:12.185
Where do you think you're going?

1108
01:41:22.362 --> 01:41:26.198
<i>And it will not stop
or answer radio communications.</i>

1109
01:41:26.282 --> 01:41:29.618
<i>The 184th vessel is called</i>
Jihn Yin Number One,

1110
01:41:29.702 --> 01:41:32.329
<i>and it's suspected of smuggling
Chinese illegal aliens.</i>

1111
01:41:32.413 --> 01:41:34.713
<i>It was spotted Saturday
by patrolling aircraft.</i>

1112
01:42:07.699 --> 01:42:09.659
- One minute, please.
- Sure.

1113
01:42:47.613 --> 01:42:49.949
- Stay down!
- Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1114
01:42:50.033 --> 01:42:52.159
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!

1115
01:42:52.243 --> 01:42:54.495
Put 'em up! Down! Down!

1116
01:42:55.496 --> 01:42:57.206
- Get on your knees.
- The keys.

1117
01:42:57.290 --> 01:43:00.209
Get on your knees! Get on your knees!

1118
01:43:03.129 --> 01:43:05.256
Hey! Hey! Get over there!

1119
01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.966
Get the fuck... Get down!

1120
01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:09.593
Turn around!
Put your hands behind you! Behind you!

1121
01:43:09.677 --> 01:43:11.721
Get down! Stay down!

1122
01:43:13.056 --> 01:43:14.807
Get down! Get down!

1123
01:43:14.891 --> 01:43:16.308
Get down, you stupid son of a...

1124
01:43:16.392 --> 01:43:18.728
- Down! Down! Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1125
01:43:23.316 --> 01:43:24.776
Come on. Stay down.

1126
01:43:25.943 --> 01:43:29.071
We want to hurt no one. We're here
for the bank's money, not your money.

1127
01:43:29.155 --> 01:43:31.991
Your money is insured by the government.
You're not gonna lose a dime.

1128
01:43:32.075 --> 01:43:34.535
Think of your families.
Don't risk your life.

1129
01:43:34.619 --> 01:43:35.995
Don't try and be a hero.

1130
01:43:36.079 --> 01:43:39.707
Right now I want you to sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

1131
01:43:39.791 --> 01:43:42.167
Anybody feels sick,
anybody got heart trouble,

1132
01:43:42.251 --> 01:43:44.336
go ahead and lean against the wall.

1133
01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:45.838
Give me the key.

1134
01:43:45.922 --> 01:43:47.715
What... What key?

1135
01:43:49.384 --> 01:43:51.719
Get down and stay down!

1136
01:43:52.637 --> 01:43:55.181
Sit there. Sit there.
Don't move. Let it bleed.

1137
01:44:04.399 --> 01:44:06.192
Get down!

1138
01:44:31.467 --> 01:44:32.635
Hey! Hey!

1139
01:44:40.852 --> 01:44:42.728
Put your heads down!

1140
01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:46.774
- Don't look at me again. I'll kill you.
- Get down. Down.

1141
01:44:46.858 --> 01:44:48.817
Put your heads down, God...

1142
01:44:48.901 --> 01:44:50.778
Get down. Get down.

1143
01:45:11.799 --> 01:45:13.675
- Hey, Casals!
- Yeah?

1144
01:45:13.759 --> 01:45:16.470
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1145
01:45:16.554 --> 01:45:20.304
This CI, Hugh Benny, called in about
a bank they're looking at or something.

1146
01:45:20.766 --> 01:45:21.893
Vincent!

1147
01:45:22.602 --> 01:45:25.605
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1148
01:45:42.955 --> 01:45:45.374
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth,

1149
01:45:45.458 --> 01:45:49.212
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1150
01:46:26.749 --> 01:46:28.292
They're already coming out.

1151
01:46:28.376 --> 01:46:31.211
Okay, we're gonna have to
take them in the car.

1152
01:46:31.295 --> 01:46:33.213
Wait till they are all in.

1153
01:46:33.297 --> 01:46:35.716
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1154
01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:46.519
- Police! Move!
- What's going on?

1155
01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.647
Move. Move. Get down.

1156
01:47:07.832 --> 01:47:09.917
Move, move. LAPD, get down.

1157
01:47:11.419 --> 01:47:12.878
Move. Down, down, down.

1158
01:47:15.756 --> 01:47:18.175
We did it, huh, Neil? Huh?

1159
01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:23.472
Move!

1160
01:47:29.228 --> 01:47:30.396
Get down.

1161
01:47:38.446 --> 01:47:39.530
Fuck! Fuck!

1162
01:47:39.614 --> 01:47:41.157
Start the car!

1163
01:47:58.090 --> 01:47:59.675
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1164
01:48:22.573 --> 01:48:24.867
Son of a bitch! Go! Go!

1165
01:48:59.402 --> 01:49:00.778
Go!

1166
01:49:25.678 --> 01:49:27.304
Go!

1167
01:50:13.184 --> 01:50:15.019
Go!

1168
01:51:08.113 --> 01:51:09.698
Come on! Come on!

1169
01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.665
Get him out of here!

1170
01:51:41.981 --> 01:51:43.440
Get down!

1171
01:51:46.652 --> 01:51:47.736
Shit!

1172
01:51:56.829 --> 01:51:58.872
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way!

1173
01:51:58.956 --> 01:52:00.999
Get them down now! Now!

1174
01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:02.633
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1175
01:52:10.801 --> 01:52:13.429
Out of the way!

1176
01:52:52.343 --> 01:52:54.219
Mommy?

1177
01:53:00.601 --> 01:53:01.977
Come here.

1178
01:53:44.228 --> 01:53:45.729
Come on, honey.

1179
01:53:47.564 --> 01:53:48.774
I got you.

1180
01:53:49.942 --> 01:53:51.151
It's okay.

1181
01:53:52.861 --> 01:53:55.071
<i>Tragedy in a Southland
neighborhood today.</i>

1182
01:53:55.155 --> 01:53:57.949
<i>A bank robbery spilled out
into the street.</i>

1183
01:53:58.033 --> 01:54:01.161
<i>Claudia Newman live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?</i>

1184
01:54:01.245 --> 01:54:03.371
<i>This afternoon,
this neighborhood was terrorized</i>

1185
01:54:03.455 --> 01:54:05.290
<i>by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1186
01:54:05.374 --> 01:54:07.542
<i>With the streets full
of midday shoppers and kids,</i>

1187
01:54:07.626 --> 01:54:09.127
<i>police and armed robbers traded...</i>

1188
01:54:09.211 --> 01:54:10.795
Excuse me. Um, bartender?

1189
01:54:10.879 --> 01:54:12.005
In a minute, lady.

1190
01:54:12.089 --> 01:54:14.841
<i>Robbery, pursuit, and finally, death.</i>

1191
01:54:14.925 --> 01:54:17.510
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood
is shaken today</i>

1192
01:54:17.594 --> 01:54:20.722

1195

1196
01:54:27.104 --> 01:54:29.731
<i>Also fatally wounded, another suspect,
Donald Breedan, who died...</i>

1197

Miss?

1198
01:54:30.941 --> 01:54:33.443
<i>Of multiple gunshot wounds
during the extensive gunfire</i>

1199

<i>between police and suspects.</i>

1200
01:54:37.114 --> 01:54:38.990
All right, hold him. Hold him.

1201
01:54:39.074 --> 01:54:40.774
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

1202
01:54:43.746 --> 01:54:44.913
All right.

1203
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:51.503
- So?
- He's got blood loss and shock.

1204
01:54:51.587 --> 01:54:54.274
I'm gonna give you quarter-gram vials
of morphine for the pain, okay?

1205
01:54:54.298 --> 01:54:56.049
Subcutaneous injections.

1206
01:54:56.133 --> 01:54:57.258
Bottom line.

1207
01:54:57.342 --> 01:55:00.178
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1208
01:55:00.262 --> 01:55:03.348
But his clavicle's fractured.
Can he rest for a while?

1209
01:55:04.349 --> 01:55:05.600
Six, seven hours.

1210
01:55:05.684 --> 01:55:07.227
- That's it?
- That's it.

1211
01:55:07.311 --> 01:55:09.605
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

1212
01:55:11.482 --> 01:55:12.941
Take off your shirt.

1213
01:55:19.782 --> 01:55:23.243
My... Look, my daughter
gave it to me as a Father's Day...

1214
01:55:23.327 --> 01:55:25.877
I don't give a shit who gave it to you.
Take it off.

1215
01:55:31.376 --> 01:55:33.879
Chris. Hey.

1216
01:55:35.923 --> 01:55:38.633
Chris, listen to me.

1217
01:55:38.717 --> 01:55:40.844
Nate's gonna pick you up.

1218
01:55:40.928 --> 01:55:43.055
He's gonna take you to his place.

1219
01:55:44.431 --> 01:55:47.183
- Where's Charlene?
- We gotta get out of here.

1220
01:55:47.267 --> 01:55:50.145
We're all over the six o'clock news.
We gotta get out of here.

1221
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:52.522
I'm not going without her.

1222
01:55:52.606 --> 01:55:53.690
Think about that.

1223
01:55:53.774 --> 01:55:56.151
I will meet you at Nate's.

1224
01:55:56.235 --> 01:55:57.819
Where are you going?

1225
01:55:57.903 --> 01:56:01.553
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1226
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:03.408
Who did it?

1227
01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.120
Who wasn't there?

1228
01:56:07.454 --> 01:56:08.789
Trejo.

1229
01:56:12.417 --> 01:56:13.585
I'll see you at Nate's.

1230
01:56:20.259 --> 01:56:23.845
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah. You still want me?

1231
01:56:23.929 --> 01:56:28.058
You come down here right now,
and you get Dominick and me. Okay?

1232
01:56:28.142 --> 01:56:30.727
<i>Okay, baby. Okay.
I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1233
01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:34.481
<i>- All right? Okay?</i>
- All right.

1234
01:56:34.565 --> 01:56:39.819
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1235
01:56:39.903 --> 01:56:42.739
You're on a plane for Los Angeles.

1236
01:56:42.823 --> 01:56:43.824
Right.

1237
01:57:31.914 --> 01:57:34.208
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1238
01:57:35.792 --> 01:57:37.210
- They made me.
- Who?

1239
01:57:37.294 --> 01:57:38.295
Where's Anna?

1240
01:57:40.088 --> 01:57:43.008
She's dead.

1241
01:57:44.051 --> 01:57:46.801
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1242
01:57:47.721 --> 01:57:49.931
Who did it? Who did it?

1243
01:57:50.015 --> 01:57:51.975
They had Anna, man.

1244
01:57:52.059 --> 01:57:53.685
Who had her? Who?

1245
01:57:54.394 --> 01:57:55.395
Waingro.

1246
01:57:56.355 --> 01:57:59.524
Waingro? On his own?

1247
01:58:01.401 --> 01:58:03.945
- For someone.
- Who?

1248
01:58:04.029 --> 01:58:06.990
The... The other he worked for.

1249
01:58:07.074 --> 01:58:09.409
Van... Zant.

1250
01:58:12.287 --> 01:58:14.915
- Van Zant?
- Yeah.

1251
01:58:15.666 --> 01:58:17.750
Van Zant.

1252
01:58:17.834 --> 01:58:19.169
Are you sure?

1253
01:58:19.253 --> 01:58:20.837
Van Zant.

1254
01:58:22.756 --> 01:58:25.156
Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1255
01:58:26.176 --> 01:58:27.511
I don't think so, Neil.

1256
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:30.013
Come on.

1257
01:58:31.265 --> 01:58:32.849
I don't remember, Neil.

1258
01:58:38.355 --> 01:58:41.566
- I'll call a medic.
- I'm not gonna make it.

1259
01:58:43.610 --> 01:58:45.821
I can't feel nothing.

1260
01:58:48.073 --> 01:58:49.533
My Anna's gone.

1261
01:58:51.952 --> 01:58:53.704
She's gone.

1262
01:58:55.747 --> 01:58:58.041
Don't leave me like this, Neil.

1263
01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:00.002
Please, homes.

1264
01:59:01.461 --> 01:59:03.463
Don't leave me like this.

1265
01:59:27.487 --> 01:59:29.239
- Yeah.
<i>- Nate.</i>

1266
01:59:30.198 --> 01:59:32.951
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1267
01:59:33.035 --> 01:59:34.703
It's a new one.

1268
01:59:36.330 --> 01:59:40.625
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace,
Encino, 10725.

1269
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:43.420
10725. Okay, Chris?

1270
01:59:44.129 --> 01:59:45.922
He's with me, my place.

1271
01:59:46.006 --> 01:59:48.467
Next, Waingro. Okay?

1272
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:51.678
You got the time?

1273
01:59:52.721 --> 01:59:56.016
I'll make time.
And I need a new out laid on.

1274
01:59:56.892 --> 01:59:58.242
How do you know it's blown?

1275
01:59:59.770 --> 02:00:01.229
How can I trust it?

1276
02:00:04.608 --> 02:00:06.109
Okay, you got it.

1277
02:00:06.902 --> 02:00:08.278
Stay healthy.

1278
02:00:13.658 --> 02:00:15.660
Charlene Shiherlis.

1279
02:00:16.453 --> 02:00:19.205
Drucker's got a safe house
in Venice to stash her in.

1280
02:00:19.289 --> 02:00:22.542
On Neil's transportation,
when we're done here, get on the phone.

1281
02:00:22.626 --> 02:00:24.794
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

1282
02:00:24.878 --> 02:00:27.922
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway laid on?

1283
02:00:28.006 --> 02:00:29.590
Sure, he did. Now he needs another one.

1284
02:00:29.674 --> 02:00:31.774
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1285
02:00:33.053 --> 02:00:35.888
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1286
02:00:35.972 --> 02:00:39.684
He's a CI for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1287
02:00:39.768 --> 02:00:42.895
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

1288
02:00:42.979 --> 02:00:45.565
Eight, ten hours
for him to set up a new out.

1289
02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:48.151
After that, he's gone. Bye-bye. Bam!

1290
02:01:41.746 --> 02:01:43.414
You ratted McCauley to us.

1291
02:01:43.498 --> 02:01:46.125
How'd you know? Who told you?

1292
02:01:46.209 --> 02:01:49.087
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1293
02:01:49.171 --> 02:01:50.672
Who?

1294
02:02:18.533 --> 02:02:20.410
<i>Conley back in for Murphy.</i>

1295
02:02:20.494 --> 02:02:22.286
<i>Now Murphy with Leggett
right there with him.</i>

1296
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:24.370
<i>Murphy tees it up, now behind the net...</i>

1297
02:02:34.966 --> 02:02:36.051
Waingro. Where is he?

1298
02:02:37.385 --> 02:02:39.721
- Where is he?
- How the hell would I know?

1299
02:02:49.064 --> 02:02:51.066
I know.

1300
02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:09.542
Well, what do we have here, huh?

1301
02:03:09.626 --> 02:03:12.254
Isn't this pretty? Isn't this pretty?

1302
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:17.258
Oh, you slimy piece of shit.

1303
02:03:17.342 --> 02:03:19.102
You told me you wanted out
from under, right?

1304
02:03:19.177 --> 02:03:22.346
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1305
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:23.681
Yeah? What's your end?

1306
02:03:23.765 --> 02:03:25.392
I don't need no stupid broad.

1307
02:03:26.685 --> 02:03:29.520
- How'd I get into this?
- Hey, hey, hey, easy. Huh?

1308
02:03:29.604 --> 02:03:32.523
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1309
02:03:32.607 --> 02:03:35.485
Fix her a drink or something.
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1310
02:03:35.569 --> 02:03:36.570
Fuck her.

1311
02:03:38.989 --> 02:03:41.491
You better get in there
and stay in there.

1312
02:03:44.786 --> 02:03:46.621
Well, lookee here.

1313
02:03:48.206 --> 02:03:50.708
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
LAPD Homicide.

1314
02:03:50.792 --> 02:03:52.392
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1315
02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:54.004
He stays with me.

1316
02:03:54.879 --> 02:03:56.047
There we go.

1317
02:04:04.806 --> 02:04:06.182
So, what now?

1318
02:04:08.351 --> 02:04:12.147
Well, he's right.
Because you want out, this is out.

1319
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:16.400
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1320
02:04:16.484 --> 02:04:18.152
No shit.

1321
02:04:18.236 --> 02:04:21.239
That's right. You would have to.

1322
02:04:21.323 --> 02:04:25.535
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1323
02:04:25.619 --> 02:04:29.413
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory.

1324
02:04:29.497 --> 02:04:31.999
'Cause you've got
no living parents to take him,

1325
02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:36.546
so he ends up state-raised
in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1326
02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:38.298
Then he steals a car.

1327
02:04:39.132 --> 02:04:44.428
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1328
02:04:44.512 --> 02:04:46.890
Fucked for life.

1329
02:04:48.058 --> 02:04:50.644
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1330
02:04:52.437 --> 02:04:56.983
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1331
02:04:58.735 --> 02:05:01.571
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1332
02:05:02.447 --> 02:05:06.368
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1333
02:05:10.455 --> 02:05:13.208
- What else are you selling?
- All kinds of shit.

1334
02:05:14.793 --> 02:05:16.711
But I don't have to sell this,
and you know it,

1335
02:05:16.795 --> 02:05:19.297
'cause this kind of shit here
sells itself.

1336
02:05:26.179 --> 02:05:29.307
- <i>Danny, here's an update.</i>
- Hey, Schwartz, Drucker's on line two.

1337
02:05:29.391 --> 02:05:31.393
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1338
02:05:33.978 --> 02:05:36.147
Lieutenant, I have Sergeant Drucker
on the other line.

1339
02:05:36.231 --> 02:05:37.681
All right, conference him in.

1340
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:42.195
- Go ahead.
- Vincent, it's me.

1341
02:05:44.739 --> 02:05:46.825
One answer. What's it gonna be?

1342
02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.500
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1343
02:05:56.584 --> 02:05:59.795
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1344
02:05:59.879 --> 02:06:03.215
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life

1345
02:06:03.299 --> 02:06:05.926
and become a born-again good citizen.

1346
02:06:06.010 --> 02:06:10.765
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1347
02:06:10.849 --> 02:06:13.517
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew.

1348
02:06:13.601 --> 02:06:17.396
Then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1349
02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:20.524
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak

1350
02:06:20.608 --> 02:06:22.652
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1351
02:06:22.736 --> 02:06:26.822
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.

1352
02:06:26.906 --> 02:06:30.660
Waingro just got himself
a suite at the airport Marquis

1353
02:06:30.744 --> 02:06:32.745
under the name Jamieson.

1354
02:06:32.829 --> 02:06:34.080
He's there now.

1355
02:06:34.164 --> 02:06:37.124
I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies,

1356
02:06:37.208 --> 02:06:40.503
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in county,</i>

1357
02:06:40.587 --> 02:06:42.922
anyone you can think of
who will put it on the street.

1358
02:06:43.006 --> 02:06:44.674
Deploy a team down at the hotel

1359
02:06:44.758 --> 02:06:47.426
<i>and personally check
their comms every 30 minutes,</i>

1360
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:50.054
because maybe Neil will go for him.

1361
02:06:50.138 --> 02:06:51.639
Okay? How you feeling?

1362
02:06:52.348 --> 02:06:53.766
Banged up, but I'll live.

1363
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:55.059
Okay.

1364
02:07:03.026 --> 02:07:04.068
He's here.

1365
02:07:05.153 --> 02:07:06.696
Neil is still here.

1366
02:07:07.864 --> 02:07:09.282
I can feel it.

1367
02:07:10.158 --> 02:07:11.493
But for how long?

1368
02:07:13.286 --> 02:07:15.538
Seven, eight hours max.

1369
02:07:24.547 --> 02:07:27.842
What did you do? That was you?

1370
02:07:27.926 --> 02:07:29.969
It's what I don't do.
I don't sell metal.

1371
02:07:30.678 --> 02:07:32.555
Would have been okay, you fly out after.

1372
02:07:32.639 --> 02:07:35.015
Now it's jammed. We gotta go together.

1373
02:07:35.099 --> 02:07:37.602
Those... Those other people were with you?

1374
02:07:39.729 --> 02:07:41.439
My friend Michael.

1375
02:07:42.857 --> 02:07:45.401
He knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

1376
02:07:49.405 --> 02:07:51.616
When it rains, you get wet.

1377
02:07:53.868 --> 02:07:55.453
Get packed. Let's go.

1378
02:08:02.585 --> 02:08:03.753
Eady!

1379
02:08:04.254 --> 02:08:05.255
Eady!

1380
02:08:14.973 --> 02:08:17.475
Why did you do this to me?

1381
02:08:28.611 --> 02:08:30.321
It's gonna be all right.

1382
02:08:30.405 --> 02:08:33.055
Do you understand that, baby?
It's gonna be all right.

1383
02:08:36.703 --> 02:08:38.121
It's gonna be all right.

1384
02:08:39.747 --> 02:08:40.999
All right?

1385
02:08:50.091 --> 02:08:52.969
There's a Camaro at this address.
Level D, slot 18.

1386
02:08:58.391 --> 02:08:59.934
Here's some cash.

1387
02:09:02.979 --> 02:09:04.147
When's it over?

1388
02:09:07.650 --> 02:09:09.235
Twenty-two hours from now.

1389
02:09:09.319 --> 02:09:10.945
Then we get out of here clean.

1390
02:09:11.029 --> 02:09:13.406
When will you let me leave?

1391
02:09:17.327 --> 02:09:20.204
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1392
02:09:20.997 --> 02:09:22.999
Will you let me leave later?

1393
02:09:28.171 --> 02:09:29.797
It will be different.

1394
02:09:31.424 --> 02:09:33.051
Do you even understand?

1395
02:10:04.082 --> 02:10:05.583
It's ready.

1396
02:10:05.667 --> 02:10:06.876
Vincent.

1397
02:10:12.924 --> 02:10:15.301
This is my friend Ralph.

1398
02:10:15.385 --> 02:10:17.303
Y-You didn't tell me you were...

1399
02:10:18.388 --> 02:10:19.972
Oh, my God.

1400
02:10:20.056 --> 02:10:21.390
Where's Lauren?

1401
02:10:21.474 --> 02:10:23.267
She's at Elizabeth's.

1402
02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:24.852
Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1403
02:10:24.936 --> 02:10:28.586
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
- What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1404
02:10:29.399 --> 02:10:31.567
Don't you even get angry?

1405
02:10:31.651 --> 02:10:36.780
I'm angry. Yeah. I'm very angry, Ralph.

1406
02:10:36.864 --> 02:10:39.951
You know, you can ball my wife
if she wants you to.

1407
02:10:41.577 --> 02:10:44.580
You can lounge around here on her sofa

1408
02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:49.168
in her ex-husband's dead-tech,

1409
02:10:49.252 --> 02:10:52.797
post-modernistic, bullshit house
if you want to.

1410
02:10:55.299 --> 02:11:01.722
But you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

1411
02:11:01.806 --> 02:11:03.266
For God's sake.

1412
02:11:09.522 --> 02:11:11.649
Put the television set down.

1413
02:11:11.733 --> 02:11:13.150
I never cheated on you, bitch.

1414
02:11:13.234 --> 02:11:15.110
- Well, maybe you should have.
- I should have?

1415
02:11:15.194 --> 02:11:16.737
In a way, you're a party to this.

1416
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:20.032
Oh, yeah, I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1417
02:11:20.116 --> 02:11:22.035
Our situation is absurd.

1418
02:11:23.036 --> 02:11:27.165
- Uh, look, maybe I should...
- Shut up! Ralph, sit down!

1419
02:11:30.084 --> 02:11:33.921
Why is it I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

1420
02:11:34.005 --> 02:11:36.423
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1421
02:11:36.507 --> 02:11:38.801
- Mmm. How admirable.
- You bet.

1422
02:11:38.885 --> 02:11:42.055
- Except none of it's about us.
- No.

1423
02:11:43.431 --> 02:11:45.849
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac,

1424
02:11:45.933 --> 02:11:49.020
but you've been walking
through our life dead.

1425
02:11:50.146 --> 02:11:54.275
And now I have to demean myself
with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1426
02:12:07.246 --> 02:12:09.581
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1427
02:12:09.665 --> 02:12:15.212
The plane... charter terminal,
LAX, Hangar 17.

1428
02:12:15.296 --> 02:12:16.964
Call letters are 10-11 -Sierra.

1429
02:12:20.343 --> 02:12:24.054
Touches down,
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1430
02:12:24.138 --> 02:12:27.725
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed flight plan, the works.

1431
02:12:29.727 --> 02:12:32.021
- And where's Chris?
- He's gone.

1432
02:12:33.481 --> 02:12:34.524
What?

1433
02:12:35.358 --> 02:12:37.651
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

1434
02:12:37.735 --> 02:12:40.485
- Didn't you bring him here?
- Yeah, I brought him here.

1435
02:12:40.822 --> 02:12:41.906
What happened?

1436
02:12:43.157 --> 02:12:45.576
It's a free country, brother.

1437
02:12:50.039 --> 02:12:53.793
Check in with me at 9:00,
if everything's still cool.

1438
02:12:55.461 --> 02:12:56.754
All right.

1439
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:22.405
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1440
02:13:25.783 --> 02:13:27.535
I know life is short.

1441
02:13:28.286 --> 02:13:30.288
Whatever time you get is luck.

1442
02:13:32.999 --> 02:13:34.584
You want to walk?

1443
02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:39.255
You walk right now,

1444
02:13:40.882 --> 02:13:42.216
or on your own

1445
02:13:43.217 --> 02:13:45.678
on your own, you choose to come with me.

1446
02:13:52.226 --> 02:13:53.895
All I know is...

1447
02:13:56.105 --> 02:14:00.734
All I know is, there's no point
in me going anywhere anymore,

1448
02:14:00.818 --> 02:14:02.445
if it's gonna be alone

1449
02:14:03.946 --> 02:14:05.156
without you.

1450
02:14:12.538 --> 02:14:13.748
Eady.

1451
02:15:03.923 --> 02:15:06.341
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1452
02:15:06.425 --> 02:15:08.678
Okay, I'll hold.

1453
02:15:11.347 --> 02:15:12.847
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1454
02:15:14.016 --> 02:15:15.685
- Yeah. Do it.
- Shut up!

1455
02:15:19.939 --> 02:15:22.024
Now, just one second at the window,

1456
02:15:23.526 --> 02:15:25.236
and it's all over.

1457
02:15:59.312 --> 02:16:01.855
Pick it up, pick it up!

1458
02:16:01.939 --> 02:16:04.483
Watch it! Watch it right there!

1459
02:16:14.493 --> 02:16:16.954
Take it, take it!

1460
02:16:42.063 --> 02:16:43.898
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1461
02:17:15.221 --> 02:17:16.722
Hey, man.

1462
02:17:16.806 --> 02:17:18.390
Yeah?

1463
02:17:18.474 --> 02:17:21.310
You know any, uh,
place to rent around here?

1464
02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:24.271
Yeah.

1465
02:17:24.355 --> 02:17:28.234
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall.

1466
02:17:39.036 --> 02:17:41.455
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1467
02:17:49.839 --> 02:17:52.007
Unit two, this is command.

1468
02:17:52.091 --> 02:17:54.385
Take him at the street. Check him out.

1469
02:17:55.052 --> 02:17:56.429
<i>10-4.</i>

1470
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:21.828
<i>- Sergeant?</i>
- Yeah.

1471
02:18:21.912 --> 02:18:23.580
This guy is John Peterson.

1472
02:18:23.664 --> 02:18:24.706
<i>Valid ID.</i>

1473
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:28.543
<i>The car's registered to the last name
Bukowski, first name Gene.</i>

1474
02:18:28.627 --> 02:18:31.046
<i>Ran it to DMV. It's clean.</i>

1475
02:18:34.216 --> 02:18:35.217
Let him go.

1476
02:18:35.926 --> 02:18:37.135
Roger.

1477
02:18:37.219 --> 02:18:39.597
Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

1478
02:18:41.807 --> 02:18:43.309
It's a no-go, Vince.

1479
02:18:50.357 --> 02:18:55.320
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1480
02:18:55.404 --> 02:18:56.906
Yeah. That'd be nice.

1481
02:19:26.644 --> 02:19:28.186
<i>Yeah?</i>

1482
02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:29.604
Yeah, what do you got?

1483
02:19:29.688 --> 02:19:31.023
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1484
02:19:42.952 --> 02:19:46.288
- Yeah.
- Hello. It's Vincent.

1485
02:19:46.372 --> 02:19:47.539
<i>What do you got?</i>

1486
02:19:47.623 --> 02:19:51.377
Nothing's going on.
Waingro went for ice. That's it.

1487
02:20:00.344 --> 02:20:01.679
You know what?

1488
02:20:04.223 --> 02:20:05.766
Neil is gone.

1489
02:20:08.477 --> 02:20:12.105
Bang! Flying like a bird.

1490
02:20:12.189 --> 02:20:14.066
Come on, Vincent. How do you know?

1491
02:20:16.235 --> 02:20:19.529
- We still got bait! Maybe some time...
- Got. Got. What do we got?

1492
02:20:19.613 --> 02:20:20.990
What do we got?

1493
02:20:21.865 --> 02:20:23.867
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1494
02:20:25.244 --> 02:20:26.870
You were good.

1495
02:20:28.497 --> 02:20:30.040
I'm going to the hotel.

1496
02:20:31.333 --> 02:20:33.335
I'm gonna take a shower.

1497
02:20:34.503 --> 02:20:37.548
Gonna sleep for a month.

1498
02:22:47.928 --> 02:22:49.054
Here.

1499
02:22:56.395 --> 02:22:57.896
Come on, baby.

1500
02:23:00.649 --> 02:23:02.860
Okay, okay, quick.

1501
02:23:06.071 --> 02:23:10.409
Shit. Why have you done this?

1502
02:23:16.457 --> 02:23:18.167
Where the fuck are my...

1503
02:23:19.543 --> 02:23:20.835
Okay, here.

1504
02:23:20.919 --> 02:23:22.879
Assholes.

1505
02:23:22.963 --> 02:23:24.589
Shoot themselves all fucking day.

1506
02:23:24.673 --> 02:23:27.426
Not you, baby. Not you!

1507
02:23:32.097 --> 02:23:34.057
<i>W-W</i>-Where would she be?

1508
02:23:34.141 --> 02:23:36.309
I mean, her name is Lauren.
Lauren Gustafson.

1509
02:23:36.393 --> 02:23:38.443
She's supposed to be here
with the police.

1510
02:23:44.943 --> 02:23:48.238
Help me. I-I-I need somebody to...

1511
02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:50.949
I got ya.

1512
02:23:53.911 --> 02:23:55.078
I got you, baby.

1513
02:23:56.246 --> 02:23:58.081
You'll be all right. I swear.

1514
02:23:58.165 --> 02:23:59.749
It's okay, baby.

1515
02:23:59.833 --> 02:24:03.420
Let's get a doctor!
Let's go! A doctor here!

1516
02:24:03.504 --> 02:24:06.005
- There's your mama. Your mama's here.
- Let's just calm down.

1517
02:24:06.089 --> 02:24:08.008
- Is she on any drugs?
- No.

1518
02:24:10.803 --> 02:24:13.805
I want you to get a trauma surgeon
down here and a vascular surgeon.

1519
02:24:13.889 --> 02:24:17.142
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel a pulse.

1520
02:24:17.226 --> 02:24:19.894
Her pressure's way down.
So is her respiration.

1521
02:24:19.978 --> 02:24:22.428
- You're gonna have to intubate her.
- It's ready.

1522
02:24:23.941 --> 02:24:25.692
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1523
02:24:25.776 --> 02:24:27.193
I don't know.

1524
02:24:27.277 --> 02:24:29.905
- Where did you find her?
- Bathtub.

1525
02:24:30.656 --> 02:24:31.948
Call respiratory, stat.

1526
02:24:32.032 --> 02:24:34.451
Give her large-bore,
normal saline, wide-open.

1527
02:24:34.535 --> 02:24:37.412
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units Oh-negative now.

1528
02:24:37.496 --> 02:24:39.146
Let's type and cross her for six.

1529
02:24:41.124 --> 02:24:43.126
Where is respiratory?
We need some more help.

1530
02:24:43.210 --> 02:24:44.919
Can you have respiratory come down now?

1531
02:24:45.003 --> 02:24:47.548
Have X-ray ready
for a post-intubation chest X-ray.

1532
02:24:52.678 --> 02:24:57.390
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery, and
she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1533
02:24:57.474 --> 02:24:58.892
Her vital signs are stable.

1534
02:24:58.976 --> 02:25:01.746
The surgeon will be out to speak to you
and let you know what's going on.

1535
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:02.854
She's okay?

1536
02:25:02.938 --> 02:25:04.731
- She's doing good.
- She's gonna be okay.

1537
02:25:04.815 --> 02:25:06.649
She's gonna be okay, honey.

1538
02:25:06.733 --> 02:25:08.359
She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1539
02:25:08.443 --> 02:25:12.155
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself? Why?

1540
02:25:12.239 --> 02:25:15.576
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1541
02:25:19.997 --> 02:25:22.707
It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

1542
02:25:22.791 --> 02:25:25.168
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1543
02:25:25.252 --> 02:25:26.461
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1544
02:25:26.545 --> 02:25:28.130
I ain't going anywhere.

1545
02:25:41.184 --> 02:25:42.185
Yeah.

1546
02:25:42.269 --> 02:25:43.770
It's me.

1547
02:25:44.479 --> 02:25:47.816
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1548
02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:49.740
On the driver's end,
I still can't find nobody,

1549
02:25:49.818 --> 02:25:51.820
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1550
02:25:51.904 --> 02:25:53.447
<i>One other thing.</i>

1551
02:25:54.406 --> 02:25:55.956
<i>You asked, so I gotta tell you.</i>

1552
02:25:56.825 --> 02:25:59.577
The guy you wanted checked into
the Hotel Marquis under Jamieson,

1553
02:25:59.661 --> 02:26:03.122
if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

1554
02:26:03.206 --> 02:26:04.749
You figured right.

1555
02:26:04.833 --> 02:26:06.585
So, so long, brother.

1556
02:26:08.754 --> 02:26:10.755
You take it easy.

1557
02:26:10.839 --> 02:26:12.549
You're home free.

1558
02:26:14.259 --> 02:26:15.886
Take it easy.

1559
02:26:26.605 --> 02:26:27.730
What is it?

1560
02:26:27.814 --> 02:26:30.484
Nothing. Home free.

1561
02:27:08.730 --> 02:27:10.648
I gotta take care of something.

1562
02:27:10.732 --> 02:27:11.942
Is there time?

1563
02:27:12.985 --> 02:27:14.069
There's time.

1564
02:27:42.931 --> 02:27:45.684
I'll be right back.
Just leave it running.

1565
02:28:27.684 --> 02:28:30.186
- <i>Registration.</i>
- Yeah. This is room service.

1566
02:28:30.270 --> 02:28:32.981
A Jamieson ordered a BLT,
and they screwed up his room number.

1567
02:28:33.065 --> 02:28:34.357
Could you give it to me, please?

1568
02:28:34.441 --> 02:28:36.161
<i>- They're always doing that.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

1569
02:28:36.234 --> 02:28:38.737
<i>- 1735.</i>
- Thank you.

1570
02:30:22.716 --> 02:30:24.509
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1571
02:30:24.593 --> 02:30:27.595
<i>We are currently
experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1572
02:30:27.679 --> 02:30:29.472
<i>Please do not panic.</i>

1573
02:30:29.556 --> 02:30:31.433
<i>Please do not take the elevators.</i>

1574
02:30:34.477 --> 02:30:36.562
<i>- Please take the nearest stairwell...</i>
- Shit.

1575
02:30:36.646 --> 02:30:39.326
- Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.
- I'm checking the stairs.

1576
02:30:39.399 --> 02:30:42.749
- If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.
<i>- Your attention, please...</i>

1577
02:30:46.114 --> 02:30:48.575
What about her dad?
You want me to call him?

1578
02:30:49.492 --> 02:30:52.245
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1579
02:30:52.329 --> 02:30:53.830
Oh.

1580
02:30:53.914 --> 02:30:55.457
And she chose you.

1581
02:30:58.084 --> 02:30:59.753
She picked your place.

1582
02:31:01.963 --> 02:31:03.506
It's not right what happened to her.

1583
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:05.634
No, it's not.

1584
02:31:09.846 --> 02:31:11.473
Oh, okay.

1585
02:31:22.067 --> 02:31:23.652
Is there any way that...

1586
02:31:26.196 --> 02:31:27.989
it could work out between us?

1587
02:31:31.076 --> 02:31:33.619
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1588
02:31:33.703 --> 02:31:36.456
But in the end...

1589
02:31:41.544 --> 02:31:43.338
You know, it's like you said.

1590
02:31:46.424 --> 02:31:50.679
All I am is what I'm going after.

1591
02:31:57.936 --> 02:32:00.146
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1592
02:32:10.699 --> 02:32:12.701
Well, go on, if you have to.

1593
02:32:14.244 --> 02:32:16.495
No. I'll stay.

1594
02:32:16.579 --> 02:32:19.207
No. I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1595
02:32:22.335 --> 02:32:23.712
Just be careful.

1596
02:32:24.629 --> 02:32:27.424
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1597
02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:29.467
Okay?

1598
02:33:26.775 --> 02:33:27.776
Yeah.

1599
02:33:30.153 --> 02:33:34.323
Security. There's a fire on three.
We have to evacuate all floors.

1600
02:33:34.407 --> 02:33:35.950
I can't leave here.

1601
02:33:44.876 --> 02:33:47.712
Why don't we just talk about this a bit,
huh, brother?

1602
02:34:02.227 --> 02:34:03.353
He's here on 17.

1603
02:34:06.564 --> 02:34:08.817
Look at me. Look at me.

1604
02:34:12.112 --> 02:34:13.321
Look at me.

1605
02:34:45.311 --> 02:34:46.687
LAPD. Don't move.

1606
02:34:46.771 --> 02:34:48.481
Put your hands on your head now!

1607
02:35:24.058 --> 02:35:26.435
Switch me to tac five.

1608
02:35:26.519 --> 02:35:29.105
Casals? J.J.?

1609
02:35:29.814 --> 02:35:31.482
Drucker, J.J.

1610
02:35:31.566 --> 02:35:34.068
<i>Vincent, I'm at the lobby level
by the stairwell.</i>

1611
02:35:34.152 --> 02:35:35.952
- What do you got?
<i>- Three teams are moving up</i>

1612
02:35:35.987 --> 02:35:38.531
<i>the other three elevators,
to the 17th-floor elevators.</i>

1613
02:35:38.615 --> 02:35:40.426
<i>All out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

1614
02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:41.770
<i>It's a mess... people everywhere.</i>

1615
02:35:41.826 --> 02:35:43.411
Fine. 10-4.

1616
02:36:14.567 --> 02:36:17.028
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

1617
02:36:30.083 --> 02:36:32.627
- Yeah, check the stairwell.
- I got it, sir.

1618
02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:02.323
Come on. Let's go.

1619
02:38:08.056 --> 02:38:10.058
- Let me have that shotgun.
- Yes, sir.

1620
02:44:28.185 --> 02:44:30.062
Told you I'm never going back.

1621
02:44:34.316 --> 02:44:35.359
Yeah.
