1
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,714
It's incredible you made it this far.

2
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,981
Why won't you finish him off?

3
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:13,576
If I kill him, he won't be of any
use to us as bait.

4
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:15,580
Did you say bait?

5
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:23,692
A few more assassins need
to be killed.

6
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:25,412
Master!

7
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:30,916
Ukiha!

8
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:36,583
Run, run away.
Wait for the next opportunity!

9
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:41,222
Run away, I want you to
complete your mission.

10
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:49,539
What are you doing? Run away quickly.

11
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:56,179
Don't worry about me. Go, go!

12
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,345
Run!

13
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:58,786
Smells nice.

14
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,830
Be quiet.

15
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:17,140
How fortunate we are on
a mountain like this.

16
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:21,007
Which one should I pick?

17
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,518
Stop it.

18
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,183
Stop it? Okay, I'll stop it. I pick you.
Taro, I'll give you this one.

19
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,791
No matter how much I try to escape...

20
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:54,901
...I can't avoid it.

21
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,337
Even if I don't want to kill...

22
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,673
...I am forced to kill.

23
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,339
You bitch!

24
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:29,632
I'm sorry, Yae...

25
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,314
I have no...

26
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:46,349
...choice but this.

27
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:52,259
If it weren't for Master,
I would never have lived.

28
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:23,123
He will protect you.

29
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,228
He always will.

30
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:43,608
I am going to wait for you.

31
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:49,344
I'll be waiting for you in Tangou.

32
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:40,531
If you hadn't been injured,
our fight would have been more fun.

33
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:52,006
It's a pity I can't stay and fight
your assassins.

34
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:01,984
Saru, I'll leave the rest to you.

35
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:22,136
Assassins are not going to show up
no matter how long we wait.

36
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:24,646
Such heavy security
for a few assassins.

37
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:32,151
General Kanbei is too cautious.
I'll be back.

38
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:37,554
Hey wait a minute.
You just took a break a while ago.

39
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:39,094
It's my turn now.

40
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,564
Let's decide with this.

41
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:48,637
- I'll bet on tails.
- Then I'll bet on heads.

42
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:36,142
I hear the strongest one
is still alive.

43
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,284
I can't wait.

44
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:51,125
Hey old man,
are you still alive?

45
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:58,766
Stop it.

46
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,977
You annoy me constantly.

47
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,260
Are you ready to die now?

48
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,247
Do you really think someone will come
and rescue a dying old man Like you?

49
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,613
Huh, old man?

50
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,316
She's already here.

51
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,075
Azumi.

52
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,146
Don't come! Don't!

53
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:51,678
No, you must come.
Otherwise, he will die.

54
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,250
Damn you!

55
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:51,725
Wow! Incredible,
she is just incredible!

56
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:52,888
Hey! Samurai bastards!
Who are you aiming at?

57
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:57,092
Damn it, who do you think we are?

58
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:01,433
Just because you're Samurai,
don't act so damn important.

59
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,497
This is bullshit!
This is our town!

60
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:08,805
Never mind about her, let's get them!

61
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,971
This is getting to be fun!

62
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,145
What the hell is your problem?

63
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:51,177
This fire ball will blow
everyone up into pieces.

64
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:36,055
Let's ignite this!

65
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh, no...

66
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:29,398
I am delighted.
No one is left to disturb us.

67
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:17,818
How splendid!
I didn't even scratch you.

68
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,569
This is the first time I've had
to defend.

69
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,198
You are wonderful.

70
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:01,517
Why not die?

71
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,234
Master.

72
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:09,943
It's over. Everything is over.

73
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:17,150
Ukiha and Nagara are both dead.

74
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:20,997
But I'm still here.

75
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:31,731
There is no further mission
that you need to pursue.

76
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:45,450
From now on, live as you wish.
Survive and keep on living.

77
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:50,117
Master,
I don't know what to do without you.

78
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:57,966
You never used to cry.

79
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:08,204
It's so quiet.

80
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:25,555
Master.

81
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:30,322
Master.

82
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,730
No, don't.

83
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:37,138
Master!

84
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,013
Where do the stars go during the day?

85
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:35,026
Time to eat!
Let's go!

86
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:51,104
The stars are always there.

87
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:54,779
You can't see them during the day,

88
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:59,012
but the stars are always watching
over us from up above the sky.

89
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:08,931
Even if we get separated one day,
we will always be together.

90
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:14,569
I'll be watching over you at all times.

91
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,370
Kanbei.

92
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:34,007
It's been a stimulating journey.

93
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:40,546
Saru is not back yet.
We can't let our guard down.

94
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:50,823
I can't be scared of assassins!
When it's time to die, you die.

95
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:55,500
Don't worry.

96
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:06,109
Lord, you won't die so easily.
Your luck is too strong.

97
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:08,073
Kanbei,

98
00:35:09,018 --> 00:35:11,282
the time has come for war.

99
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:15,051
That stupid old leyasu...

100
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,156
we will blow him up into pieces.

101
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,574
You have done well in protecting me.

102
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,011
Once we get home,

103
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:42,810
I'll take you to
a hot spring for some r est.

104
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,061
Masterful!

105
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,175
Lord!

106
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,780
Nagara.

107
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:07,281
What are you doing?

108
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:32,043
We are the only two left.

109
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:36,512
What shall we do now?

110
00:39:38,654 --> 00:39:48,188
Nagamasa Asano, Kiyomasa Kato...
the next tar get is Masayuki Sanada.

111
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,267
This time, we'll probably be killed.

112
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,831
We are not going to die.

113
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:01,438
We will survive.

114
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,043
Everyone is with us.

115
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:12,984
Let's go.
