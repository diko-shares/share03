175
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,699
-What girl?
-That girl. It sounded like,

176
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,528
"Read the small print." And
there does seem to be a lot of...

177
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,408

Oh. Just keeps on coming.

Yeah, you don't wanna
listen to Noodle, Mr. Wonka.

181
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,605

- Damaged?

Orphan Syndrome.

183

Orphan Syndrome?

184
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,543
Orphan Syndrome.

185
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,244
Orphan Syndrome.

186
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,890
She was dropped down the laundry
chute as a bab, and I took her in

out the goodness of my heart,

188
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,684
and I've done my best,
Mr. Wonka, honest, I have,

189
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,820
but she's been left with
a suspicious nature.

190
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,222
She sees conspiracy everywhere.

191
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,558
- Poor girl.
- I know.

I wanna teach you a lesson,
you miserable little bookworm.

Evening, Mr. Wonka.

How'd it go?

368
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,287
Not quite as well as I'd hoped.

Oh, shame. Well, I'm afraid
we do have to settle up now.

For the room, yes.

373

incurred a few extras

residency with ourselves.

- Have I?
- Yes, you have.

376
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,476
There was that glass of
gin you had on arrival,

377
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,076
and if I remember rightly,

378
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,447
you warmed your
cockles by the fire.

379
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,281
He did indeed, Mrs. Scrubitt.

380
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,584
- [door shuts, locks]
- Cockle-warming is extra, see?

381

Used the stairs to get
to his room, and all.

382
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,030
[Mrs. Scrubitt] Oh, then
you've got your stair charge,

383
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,624
and that is per step,
I'm afraid. Up and down.

384
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,325
Now, tell me, Mr. Wonka,

385
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,595

use the mini bar?

386
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,729
There's a minibar?

389

- Uh... I might have, briefly.
- Oh-ho!

00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,770
See? Even Bleacher knows you
never touch the mini bar,

391
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,738
and he was raised
in a ditch. [snorts]

392
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,607
Add in your mattress hire,

393
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,742

your pillow penalty,

394
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,444

[Mrs. Scrubitt]
Twenty-seven years.

- [Bleacher] Four months.

407

- Who are you?

412
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:31,244
Abacus Crunch,
chartered accountant.

413
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,746
At least, I was.

414
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,047
- Now, uh...
- He runs the place.

And you best do as he says,
or you'll answer to me.

416

So they got all of
you, too, did they?

424
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,433
[Abacus] I'm afraid so.

425
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,735
We each of us found ourselves

426
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,335

place to stay,

427

- He does.
- A lot.

[Larry] I've only
been married once,

433
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:13,252

There are bars on the window
and there's a dog on the door.

[Abacus] And even if
you could get out,

00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,909
I'm making chocolate, o' course.

518
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,343
How do you like it? Dark?

519
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,846
White? Nutty?
Absolutely insane?

520
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,347
I don't know.

521
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,417
I've never had any.

522
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,920
[gibbers] You've
never had chocolate?

523
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,588
- No.
- [shouts] What?

524
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,890
You've never had chocolate?

525
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,659
Still no.

526
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,361
Well, this is unbelievable.
I mean, this is outrageous.

527
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,363
Well, lucky for you,
Noodle, I have a selection

528
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,799
of the world's
finest ingredients

529
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,600
right here in my travel factory.

530
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,636
[gentle music playing]

531
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,040
Whoa.

532
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,909
Where to begin?
That's the question.

533
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,477
I know!

534
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,678
Silver Linings.

535
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,747
Made of condensed thunder clouds

536
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,349
and liquid sunlight.

537
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,419
[sniffs] Helps you see
that faint ray o' hope

538
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,353
beyond the shadow of despair.

539
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,656
Just what we need,

540
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,033
- wouldn't you say?
- [chuckles softly]

541
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,725
Did you always wanna
make chocolate?

542
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,694
[Willy] No. [chuckles]

543
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,129
Back when I was your age,

544
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,064
I wanted to be a magician.

545
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,767
My mom was a cook.

546
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,368
We lived on the river,
just the two of us.

547
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:59,338
In a perfect little
world of our own.

548
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,743
<i>The way I remember
it, I used to spend</i>

549
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,445
<i>every waking hour
trying to come up</i>

550
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,647
<i>with some new trick
to impress my mom.</i>

551
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,051
Bravo!

552
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,587
[Willy] <i>But the real
magic came from her.</i>

553
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,491
<i>We didn't have a lotta
money, but each week,</i>

554
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,627
<i>she brought home one cocoa bean.</i>

555
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,495
<i>And by the time my
birthday came around,</i>

556
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,731
<i>there was enough to make
a single bar o' chocolate.</i>

557
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,802
<i>But it wasn't just
any old chocolate.</i>

558
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:31,538
<i>Far from it.</i>

559
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,074
This has to be the best
chocolate in the world.

560
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,775
[Mamma] Oh, don't
know about that.

561
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,078
They say the very best
comes from a place

562
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,180
called the Galeries Gourmet.

563
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,949
Theirs can't be any
better than yours, Mamma.

564
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,584
It's impossible.

565
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,854
Well, as it so happens,

566
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:49,656
I do know a little secret

567
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,958
that even those
fancy-pants don't.

568
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,027
What is it?

569
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,729
I'll tell ya.

570
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,531
When you're older. Now
get to sleep. [chuckles]

571
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:03,737
[exhales]

572
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,606
We should go, Amma.

573
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,108
Where's that, then?

574
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,210
- To the Galeries Gourmet.
- What?

575
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,212
- And start a shop?
- Yeah.

576
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,915
With our name above the
door and everything.

577
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:16,950
That's a wonderful dream, honey.

578
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,653
Is that all it is?

579
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,489
Just a dream?

580
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,025
Hey now.

581
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:32,232
Every good thing in this
world started with a dream.

582
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,701
So you hold on to yours.

583
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,937
And when you do share
chocolate with the world,

584
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,540
oh, I'll be right
there beside ya.

585
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,541
Promise?

586
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:42,776
Do better than that.

587
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,078
[chuckles] I pinkie promise.

588
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,581
Now,

589
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,616
sleep.

590
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,955
[Noodle] <i>So, what
was it, Willy?</i>

591
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,958
<i>What was the secret?</i>

592
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,592
[Willy] <i>I never found out.</i>

593
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:04,164
<i>Soon after, she fell sick.</i>

594
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:07,534
<i>And before I knew it, all I had
left was her bar of chocolate.</i>

595
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,274
That's why I'm here, Noodle.

596
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,544
So I can feel the same
way I did back then,

597
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,179
eating chocolate with her.

598
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,916
What do you mean?

599
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,127
My mom once promised that when I
share chocolate with the world,

600
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,020
she'd be right there beside me.

601
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,788
[machine clicking]

602
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:31,024
I know it sounds crazy,
but I always hoped

603
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,337
she'd somehow keep that promise.

604
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,529
She might even
tell me her secret.

605
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:38,932
[bell dings]

606
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,035
[both chuckle]

607
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,237
Here. Try one.

608
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,091
Wish you hadn't done that.

609
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,761
- You don't like it?
- No,

610
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,163
I like it. It's just...

611
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,033
What?

612
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:17,604
Now each day I don't have
chocolate will be a little harder.

613
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,207
Then how would you like to have all
the chocolate you can eat, every day,

614
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,742
for the rest of your life?

615
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:23,910
A lifetime supply?

616
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,179
A lifetime supply.

617
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:27,313
What would I have to do?

618
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:29,182
Not much. Just get
me out of here.

619
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,184
- [gasps] Are you crazy?
- Shh!

620
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,186
It's easy. I'll get
someone to cover my shift,

621
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,830
and you could smuggle me
out in your laundry cart.

622
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,098
- But I...
- Just for a few hours, mind.

623
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,791
No one will even
know I was gone.

624
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,626
What's the point of that?

625
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,303
To sell chocolate, o' course!
We'll split the profits

626
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,671
and pay off Mrs.
Scrubitt in no time.

627
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,097
It's a nice idea, Willy.

628
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,099
- It's a great idea.
- But it'll never work.

629
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,834
'Course it will.
Eat your chocolate.

630
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,969
[Noodle] You don't understand.

631
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,605
Mrs. Scrubitt's like a hawk. She
keeps her beady eye on everything

632
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,874
that comes in and out of
the Wash House except...

633
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:56,910
Huh.

634
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,678
What is it?

635
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,780
No, it's nothing.

636
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,915
Oh, okay.

637
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,817
Huh.

638
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,285
Double-huh! That's
not nothing.

639
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,029
That's the Silver Lining.
It's given you an idea.

640
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,656
Okay. So, the one time
she dropped her guard

641
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,624
was when this aristocrat
came to the laundry.

642
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,393
He was only asking
for directions,

643
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:15,628
but she was all over
him like a rash.

644
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:16,996
It was disgusting.

645
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,331
That's it, Noodle.

646
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,899
All we have to do is
find an aristocrat

647
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,768
and slip out while
she's distracted.

648
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,404
Yeah, but...

649
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,672
where are we going to
find an aristocrat?

650
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:27,874
[ding]

651
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,776
Huh.

652
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,810
Huh?

653
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,879
Huh.

654
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,114
A double-huh.

655
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,324
Do you have a pencil and paper?

656
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,851
- Uh-huh.
- I got an idea.

657
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,755
[distant singing]

658
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,161
[soft music playing]

659
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,396
- [male choir singing]
- [knocks along to song]

660
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:52,732
[lock clicks]

661
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,440
I've come to make a confession.

662
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,841
[singing continues]

663
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,144
You sound great,
fellas. Keep it up.

664
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,418
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

665
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,923
I have had 150 of these
since my last confession.

666
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,228
Temptation is very
hard to resist.

667
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:27,434
Mmm.

668
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,935
[chief] Send me down.

669
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,672
- [whirring]
- I'll see you later.

670
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,409
[elevator dings]

671
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,679
[woman] Good evening, Chief.

672
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:41,482
They're all waiting.

673
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:42,916
Thank you very much.

674
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:47,787
Good evening, gentlemen.
I've brought my invoice.

675
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,492
One chocolatier moved
on for the usual fee.

676
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:53,059
Oh. [chuckles]

677
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,394
Here we go, baby.

678
00:29:54,428 --> 00:29:56,095
There's the good stuff. Yeah.

679
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,064
[Slugworth] Tell me, Chief...
[chief] Mm-hmm?

680
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,042
How would you like to
earn a few more of those?

681
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,435
Oh, I am listening.

682
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,236
[Slugworth] We
think that Mr. Wonka

683
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,207
might require a little
more than simply moving on.

684
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,808
- Oh.
- [Slugworth] He's good.

685
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:09,976
Too good.

686
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,277
And what's more,

687
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,813
he only charges a
sovereign a chocolate.

688
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,249
So anyone can afford
them, even the...

689
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,953
You know, the...

690
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:22,489
- The poor?
- [gags] Oh, dear.

691
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:25,325
I've just been a little
bit sick in my mouth.

692
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,026
Could you please
refrain from mentioning

693
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,828

My mom, she'd be waiting
there for me at the door,

00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:36,579
[Abacus] <i>There's thousands
of gallons of chocolate</i>

1209
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:40,106

Cartel use it to bribe,</i>

1210
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:43,276

1211
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:45,422
- [Slugworth] I do not care that they were school children...
- [gasps]

1212
00:50:45,446 --> 00:50:48,080
they were in our way. Next
time, put your foot down.

1213
00:50:48,114 --> 00:50:49,483
Miss Bon-Bon?

1214
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,193
[Miss Bon-Bon] Good
morning, Mr. Slugworth.

1215
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:53,687
From now on, I'll be keeping
the ledger in the vault.

1216
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,987
[Miss Bon-Bon] Very good, sir.

1217
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,524
Oh, and Mr. Crunch?

1218
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:00,359
Yes?

1219
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:01,662
You're fired.

1220
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:04,997
Very good, sir.

1221
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:08,535
[Abacus] <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka,</i>

1222
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:11,605
<i>but they've got you right
where they want you.</i>

1223
00:51:11,638 --> 00:51:14,441
<i>You can't get a shop
without selling chocolate,</i>

1224
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:18,277

- [wind whistling]

1226
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:22,315
[Willy, softly] Hey, Noodle!

1227
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:24,050
Noodle! Psst!

1228
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,552
[switch clicks]

1229
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:26,629
[Noodle] What is it, Willy?

1230
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,020
Watch out.

1231
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:29,054
Whoa!

1232
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,229
What's this for?

1233
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:39,666
Your wages. A lifetime
supply, remember?

1234
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,400
You didn't have to do that.

1235
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:44,003
Of course I did. I
gave you my word.

1236
00:51:44,705 --> 00:51:47,106
Well, thanks.

1237
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,409
- I've got something for you, too.
- For me?

1238
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:56,617
What's this?

1239
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,553
- Glass half full?
- Other way up.

1240
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:01,220
[Willy] Glass half empty.

1241
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:03,557
It's an "A." Your
first letter.

1242
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,592
I'm teaching you to read.

1243
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,494
Oh, Noodle.

1244
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:09,506
Well, I can't have my business
partner eaten by a tiger.

1245
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,364
Or nearly eaten.

1246
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:13,366
So we're still partners?

1247
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:15,802
Sure, but I don't know how
we're gonna sell any chocolate.

1248
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:18,438
Every time the police show up,
you'd have to vanish into thin air.

1249
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:20,373
Like a magician.

1250
00:52:20,407 --> 00:52:21,742
[gasps] Right!

1251
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:23,777
Yeah, but it's one thing
when you're onstage.

1252
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,513
You have ropes and
pulleys and trapdoors.

1253
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,080
There's none of
those on the street.

1254
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:30,082
[Piper] As a matter
of fact, there are.

1255
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:32,184
There are trapdoors
all over the city.

1256
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:33,854
They're called storm drains.

1257
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:35,288
I'd be happy to show you around

1258
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:36,690
if you cut me in on the action.

1259
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,367
- [switch clicks]
- [Larry] If you're recruiting,

1260
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,860
I'd do anything
to get out of here

1261
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:41,394
and make up with my wife.

1262
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:44,163
I don't have any
practical skills, but,

1263
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:46,667
[gurgling] I can talk
like I'm under water.

1264
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,268
And if you need someone
to handle communications,

1265
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,771
I'm your woman.

1266
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,773
[Willy] Lottie?

1267
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,508
What? Why you all
staring at me?

1268
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,543
I did not know she could speak.

1269
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,779
- I thought you were a mime.
- [Lottie] No,

1270
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:01,748
I actually used to work
at the telephone exchange.

1271
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:04,651
But back then, I was quite
the chatterbox. [chuckles]

1272
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:06,085
But since I came here,

1273
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:09,255
I haven't had much
to chat about.

1274
00:53:09,288 --> 00:53:10,800
- [switch clicks]
- [Abacus] Far be it from me

1275
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:12,893
to pour cold water
on all your fun,

1276
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,495
but if Mrs. Scrubitt catches
you trying to escape,

1277
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:18,297
you'll all get six
months in the coop.

1278
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,866
So just think about that

1279
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,769
before getting involved in
this harebrained scheme.

1280
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:25,271
But it's not
harebrained, Abacus.

1281
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:27,407
Willy's chocolates
are incredible.

1282
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:28,875
Try one.

1283
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,510
[Abacus] That's very
kind of you, Noodle.

1284
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:33,112
I don't care how good
his chocolates are.

1285
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,182
When do we start?

1286
00:53:37,283 --> 00:53:39,453
[bell dinging melodically]

1287
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:49,606
[Colin] I guess what I'm
trying to say, Barbara, is, um,

1288
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,198
- will you marry me?
- [Barbara] Oh. [sighs]

1289
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,700
I dunno, Colin.

1290
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,277
You're a lovely man, but
I'm looking for someone

1291
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,613
to sweep me off
my feet. You know,

1292
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:59,406
whisk me off to a
life of adventure.

1293
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:00,674
Could that be you?

1294
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,410
- No.
- Oh.

1295
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:05,879
Not with my chronic
lack of self-confidence.

1296
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,615
- Uh, I best be off.
- Oh, but Colin...

1297
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:10,417
Sorry to have wasted
your time, Barbara.

Honestly? No.

1540

No!

1541
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,394
No.

1542
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,196
- No.
- Definitely not.

1543
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,264
But,

1544
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:53,132
as it so happens,

1545
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,867
we don't need to
sell chocolate today.

1546
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:56,035
And why is that?

1548

1552

[Abacus] Now, I know
what you're thinking.

1553
01:04:16,823 --> 01:04:19,025
It may need a little work.

1554

[lights buzz]

1555
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:22,972
[Piper] Looks like someone
left the water running

1556
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,064
twenty years ago and the
ceiling fell through.

1557
01:04:25,098 --> 01:04:27,534
And the ceiling above that,
and the ceiling above that.

1558
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:29,869
[Abacus] But that
means we can afford it.

1559
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:31,371
For a week, anyway.

1560
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:33,206
[Lottie] And we'd
finally be legitimate.

1561
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:34,874
The police wouldn't
have any excuse

1562

1563

do you think, Willy?

Noodle, it's just as
I always imagined.

1567
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,892
No, scratch that, it's
better than I imagined.

1568
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:54,428
I mean, look at this place.

1569
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:56,497
I mean, yeah, it's a wreck,
but... the potential!

01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,410
You mark my words, this is
gonna be the best chocolate shop

1572

- Whoo!

1573
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,179
You won't be scrub-scrubbin'
much longer, Noodle.

Including the little girl.

She seems to be the
brains of the operation.

1581
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:28,261
They're based out of a laundry
called Scrubitt and Bleacher.

1582
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:30,396
[inhales sharply] Scrubitt's?

1583
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:32,599
That's right. Why, you know it?

1584
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:35,101
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

1585
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:36,570
[chief] They just rented a shop.

1586
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:38,871
So, legally, I can't
touch them. But illegally,

1587
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:41,341
I'm happy to do
whatever you guys want.

1588
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,951
You want 'em all to
have a little accident?

1589
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:44,210
In which they die?

1590
01:05:44,243 --> 01:05:45,878
Not a problem.

1591
01:05:45,912 --> 01:05:47,390
But it's gonna cost you
a lot more chocolate.

1592
01:05:47,414 --> 01:05:49,182
It's all right, Chief.

1593
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:51,260
[chief] And also, I'd, uh,
be grateful for an advance.

1594
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,386
'Cause the last boxes
you gave me... [chuckles]

1595
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,954

1596
01:05:54,987 --> 01:05:56,189
All of them?

three days. [chuckles]

1599
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,270
You know, you think they're
gonna give you the same hit.

1600
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,430
[laughs] They don't.

1601
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:04,665
Oh. [breathing heavily]

1602
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:06,265
[Slugworth] There
you go, Chief.

1603
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:08,134
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1604
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,370
You stand down for now.

1605
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:11,614
We'll give you a call
when the time is right.

What is it, Arthur?

1609
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,415
[Slugworth] The girl.

1610
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:23,848
[Fickelgruber] You don't really
think it could be her, do you?

1611
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,619
I do.

1612
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:28,522
You always assured us she
wouldn't be a problem.

1613
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:30,524
He's right. You did assure us.

1614
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:32,291
And she won't be.

Good evening.

out to sell chocolate

01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:14,256
quite viciously with
a cocktail stick.

1883
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,182
Look. Where Slugworth
shook my hand.

1884
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:18,251
His ring left a mark. See?

1885
01:20:18,284 --> 01:20:20,253
It's an "A," surrounded by "S"s.

1886
01:20:20,286 --> 01:20:22,822
So what? His name
is Arthur Slugworth.

1887
01:20:22,855 --> 01:20:24,425
It's probably a family ring.

1888
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,159
Yes, but Noodle has
one just like it.

1889
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:28,027
- Noodle?
- Uh-huh.

1890
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:31,798
Why would Noodle the orphan
have a Slugworth family ring?

1891
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:33,467
There's only one
reason I can think of.

1892
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,168
Which is?

1893
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:36,779
And if I'm correct, Noodle
could be in grave danger.

1894
01:20:36,803 --> 01:20:38,871
Well, come on,
Wonka. Spit it out.

1895
01:20:38,905 --> 01:20:40,773
Produce your owl
pellet of wisdom.

1896
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,242
There's no time.
I gotta get back.

1897
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:44,177
- Captain!
- Wonka?

1898
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:47,481
Come back here. Wonka!
I demand an explanation.

1899
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:48,514
Captain?

1900
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:54,220
On second thoughts, the
explanation can wait.

1901
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:55,288
Good day to you.

1902
01:20:56,289 --> 01:20:57,290
[water splashes]

1903
01:20:59,259 --> 01:21:00,360
[water splashes]

1904
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:05,898
[chief] Well, gentlemen,

1905
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:08,535
one dead chocolatier,
as requested.

1906
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,871
Miss Bon-Bon?

1907
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:13,239
[Miss Bon-Bon]
<i>Yes, Mr. Slugworth?</i>

1908
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:14,774
Give the chief his chocolate.

1909
01:21:23,316 --> 01:21:25,084
[Mrs. Scrubitt] <i>My, my.</i>

1910
01:21:25,118 --> 01:21:27,920
What a lot o' long
faces this morning.

1911
01:21:27,954 --> 01:21:30,923
It's almost as though you lot
had a sneaky little scheme

1912
01:21:30,957 --> 01:21:33,026
to try and wriggle
out of your contracts.

1913
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:36,162
- Which spectacularly misfired.
- [Bleacher grunts, chuckles]

1914
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:38,097
But I've got some
good news for you lot,

1915
01:21:38,131 --> 01:21:39,932
not that you deserve it.

1916
01:21:39,966 --> 01:21:43,202
Your friend, Mr. Wonka, done
a deal with Mr. Slugworth.

1917
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:44,571
What?

1918
01:21:44,605 --> 01:21:47,907
Gave up on his dream to
settle your accounts.

1919
01:21:48,975 --> 01:21:50,343
- Mr. Crunch.
- Present.

1920
01:21:54,347 --> 01:21:55,416
You're free to go.

1921
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,318
Scram, bookworm.

1922
01:21:58,351 --> 01:21:59,852
[Mrs. Scrubitt]
Bell. [Lottie] Hello.

1923
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:01,030
[Mrs. Scrubitt] Sling yer hook.

1924
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:02,388
Benz.

1925
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:04,223
You ain't gotta tell
me twice. [chuckles]

1926
01:22:04,257 --> 01:22:05,559
[Mrs. Scrubitt] Chucklesworth.

1927
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,193
You've been a terrible audience.

1928
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,895
Good night!

1929
01:22:08,928 --> 01:22:10,072
Yeah, well, you ain't been
much of a comedian, mate.

1930
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:12,365
- [Larry] I know.
- Hey, Larry.

1931
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:15,134
Keep going. You've
got something.

1932
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,437
You scare me.

1933
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,440
[Mrs. Scrubitt] And
finally, Noodle.

1934
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:22,175
Biggest pile o' the lot.

1935
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:24,611
But this isn't to pay your bill.

1936
01:22:24,645 --> 01:22:27,080
- This is to keep you here.
- [door shuts]

1937
01:22:27,113 --> 01:22:28,482
- What do you mean?
- [door locks]

1938
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:30,950
[Mrs. Scrubitt] My
friend, Mr. Slugworth,

1939
01:22:30,983 --> 01:22:32,985
doesn't think nasty
little urchins like you

1940
01:22:33,019 --> 01:22:34,187
should be out on the streets,

1941
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,888
lowering the tone.

1942
01:22:35,922 --> 01:22:38,024
So, he gave me this money

1943
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:41,495
to keep you down in the
Wash House for good.

1944
01:22:41,528 --> 01:22:44,297
And I'm only too
happy to oblige.

1945
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,666
- I hate you!
- [Bleacher] Hey!

1946
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:47,076
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Mrs. Scrubitt laughs]

1947
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,001
Look at her go,
Lord Bleachowitz.

1948
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:50,671
- [both laugh]
- Lord Bleachowitz?

1949
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:52,539
You don't still think
he's a lord, do you?

1950
01:22:52,573 --> 01:22:54,006
What?

1951
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,142
We made it up, you
stupid old hag.

1952
01:22:56,175 --> 01:22:57,910
[Bleacher] She's...
she's lying.

1953
01:22:57,944 --> 01:23:00,279
Right, that's it, you
horrible little brat.

1954
01:23:00,313 --> 01:23:03,049
You're goin' in
the coop, my girl.

1955
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:05,952
And you! Take them
dungarees off,

1956
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:08,955
you... you peasant. [sobs]

1957
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:10,691
But Puffy-wuffy.

1958
01:23:10,724 --> 01:23:12,158
I wuv you.

1959
01:23:13,259 --> 01:23:14,327
[Noodle gasps]

1960
01:23:15,962 --> 01:23:18,131

1963
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:32,011
[thud]

1964
01:23:35,214 --> 01:23:36,214
[footsteps approaching]

1965
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:40,654
Hello, Noodle.

1966
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:43,557
[gasps] Willy. I
thought you'd gone.

1967
01:23:44,257 --> 01:23:45,526
I did.

1968
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:47,293
Slugworth promised
you a better life,

1969
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,630
but he didn't exactly keep
his side of the bargain.

1970
01:23:49,663 --> 01:23:51,498
So I came back. We all did.

1971
01:23:51,532 --> 01:23:53,065
[Piper] Hey, Noodle.
[Abacus] How do?

1972
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:54,577
[Lottie] Hey. [Larry
gurgling] Surprise!

1973
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:56,302
[Noodle] He wants me
locked up forever.

1974
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,004
Yeah, well, that figures.

1975
01:23:58,037 --> 01:24:00,273
Why? What's he got against me?

1976
01:24:00,306 --> 01:24:02,308
I don't know,
Noodle. Not for sure.

1977
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,521
All I know for certain is that
you won't be safe until Slugworth

1978
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,514
- is behind bars.
- [footsteps approaching]

1979
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:10,451
And how exactly is that
supposed to happen?

1980
01:24:10,484 --> 01:24:12,385
Abacus. You said
the Cartel keep

1981
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:13,696
a record of all
their dirty deeds.

1982
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,388
In the green ledger, yes.

1983
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:16,989
[Willy] So if we can
get hold o' that,

1984
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:18,300
we can prove that they
poisoned our chocolate.

1985
01:24:18,324 --> 01:24:19,636
Scrubitt and Bleacher
would go to jail,

1986
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,993
and we'll all be free.

1987
01:24:21,027 --> 01:24:23,129
Uh, yes, but may I remind you,

1988
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:25,064
they keep that
ledger in a vault.

1989
01:24:25,097 --> 01:24:26,533
Guarded by a corrupt cleric.

1990
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,035
And 500 chocoholic monks.

1991
01:24:29,068 --> 01:24:31,404
- [group] Mm-hmm.
- That's all true.

1992
01:24:31,438 --> 01:24:34,040
But I went for a long,
cold swim this morning.

1993
01:24:34,073 --> 01:24:35,485
Cold water is very
good for the brain.

1994
01:24:35,509 --> 01:24:37,376
Stimulates the neural pathways.

1995
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,413
And after just four
miles, it came to me.

1996
01:24:39,446 --> 01:24:41,214
How an ingenious orphan,

1997
01:24:41,247 --> 01:24:42,381
an accountant, a plumber,

1998
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,418
a telephone exchange operator,

1999
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:46,152
and a man who can
speak underwater,

2000
01:24:46,185 --> 01:24:47,488
could combine those talents,

2001
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:49,355
and pull off the
heist of the century.

2002
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:52,258
But even if we do get
our hands on that ledger,

2003
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:55,127
the Cartel will simply bribe
their way out of trouble.

2004
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,330
- It's what they do.
- [sighs]

2005
01:24:57,363 --> 01:24:59,098
[Noodle] The greedy
beat the needy, Willy.

2006
01:24:59,131 --> 01:25:01,067
It's just the way of the world.

2007
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,569
[Willy] You're right, Noodle.

2008
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:04,447
I guess that's why there's
one other thing to do.

2009
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,773
- What's that?
- [softly] Change the world.

2010
01:25:10,276 --> 01:25:11,310
[Piper] Whoa!

2011
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:12,646
[chuckles]

2012
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:13,780
Where do we start?

2013
01:25:13,814 --> 01:25:16,315

Could you spare a piece of
chocolate for a starvin' orphan?

2017
01:25:31,097 --> 01:25:34,568
I'm sorry, my child. I
don't have any on me.

2018
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,102
[Noodle] Oh.

2019
01:25:37,838 --> 01:25:39,506

01:25:40,607 --> 01:25:41,608

might wanna what?

as you all know,

01:26:19,813 --> 01:26:22,348
it's Baron von
Schmeichelhammer's funeral today.

And his widow is...

- [monks] Ugh!

2039
01:26:28,655 --> 01:26:30,198
[Father Julius] So, I
don't want to see anyone

we shall be judged for our sins,

01:34:30,937 --> 01:34:33,139
We'll take that, thank you.

2221
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:35,842
How much chocolate do you have at
your factory, Mr. Fickelgruber?

2222
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,977
Oh, about 80,000 gallons.

2223
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:40,013
- Prodnose?
- [mumbles]

2224
01:34:40,046 --> 01:34:41,114
[Prodnose] Seventy-five?

2225
01:34:41,147 --> 01:34:42,582
[Slugworth] And I've got 150.

2226
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:45,051
That should be enough.

2227
01:34:45,085 --> 01:34:46,085
For what?

2228
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,756
Death by chocolate.

2229
01:35:01,267 --> 01:35:02,836
[lights buzz]

2230
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:04,971
[chocolate bubbles]

2231
01:35:07,974 --> 01:35:09,175
On you go.

2232
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:28,962
Uh, gentlemen.

2233
01:35:30,363 --> 01:35:32,065
Considering the situation,

2234
01:35:32,098 --> 01:35:34,300
I wondered if you'd do a
good deed on my behalf.

2235
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,436
A what?

2236
01:35:35,469 --> 01:35:37,103
"A good deed."

2237
01:35:37,137 --> 01:35:39,072
It's a sort of pointless
act of selflessness...

2238
01:35:39,105 --> 01:35:41,442
Yes, of course, Mr. Wonka.

2239
01:35:41,475 --> 01:35:43,743
What would you like us to do?

2240
01:35:43,776 --> 01:35:45,736
I was wondering if you
could give this to someone.

2241
01:35:46,946 --> 01:35:48,681
Only if you happen to see him.

2242
01:35:48,715 --> 01:35:49,816
And who is it?

2243
01:35:49,849 --> 01:35:52,152
- A little orange man.
- Eh?

2244
01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:53,786
A little orange man.

2245
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,054
About eight inches high,

2246
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:56,990
with orange skin and
bright green hair.

2247
01:35:57,023 --> 01:36:00,226
I owe him a jar of chocolates,
you see. And, well,

2248
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:02,962
I think these might be
the best I ever made.

2249
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:04,230
Well, in that case,

2250
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,232
I'll make sure he
gets them personally.

2251
01:36:11,204 --> 01:36:12,705
Farewell, Mr. Wonka.

2252
01:36:14,073 --> 01:36:15,073
Urchin.

2253
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,348
[whirring]

2254
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:29,189
- [heavy thudding]
- [Noodle gasps] Willy...

2255
01:36:36,162 --> 01:36:37,764
[handles squeaking]

2256
01:36:39,098 --> 01:36:41,100
[chocolate gurgling]

2257
01:36:54,914 --> 01:36:56,950
What are we gonna do, Willy?

2258
01:36:56,983 --> 01:36:59,453
I don't know, Noodle.
I'll think of something.

2259
01:37:04,525 --> 01:37:06,793
[elevator dings]

2260
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:08,795
Best chocolate he ever made, eh?

2261
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:10,964
[Prodnose chuckling excitedly]

2262
01:37:10,997 --> 01:37:12,865
- Whoo-hoo.
- Oh!

2263
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:14,133
[chocolate bubbling]

2264
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:15,835
[Willy] I got it!

2265
01:37:15,868 --> 01:37:17,012
[Noodle] What is it? Did
you think of something?

2266
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:18,404
[Willy] Yes, I did.

2267
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:20,139
If we're gonna drown
in chocolate, Noodle,

2268
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:22,375
and let's face it, we're
gonna drown in chocolate,

2269
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:24,143
then it's gonna be
Wonka chocolate.

2270
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:27,113
We're not gonna drown,
Willy. Look, there's a light.

2271
01:37:27,146 --> 01:37:29,048
We'll let the
chocolate lift us up,

2272
01:37:29,082 --> 01:37:30,383
we'll bang on the glass,

2273
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:32,952
and pray somebody hears us.

2274
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:34,287
That's a much better idea.

2275
01:37:35,855 --> 01:37:37,056
[elevator dings]

2276
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,492
Ah, gentlemen.

2277
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,393
It was a bit of a close
shave this morning,

2278
01:37:40,427 --> 01:37:42,128
and I was wondering if perhaps

2279
01:37:42,161 --> 01:37:44,797
we could rethink our
arrangement. Or...

2280
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:51,137
Or... just leave
things as they are.

2281
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,171
[Slugworth] Father.

2282
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,808
Well, Wonka might be as
nutty as a fruitcake,

2283
01:37:55,842 --> 01:37:57,377
but he sure knew how
to make chocolate.

2284
01:37:57,411 --> 01:37:59,078
- [Father Julius] Mmm.
- But do you think

2285
01:37:59,112 --> 01:38:01,023
we should have saved some
for the Little Orange Man?

2286
01:38:01,047 --> 01:38:02,483
Tell me you're joking.

2287
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:05,985
Uh, yes. Yes, I am.
Sorry, why am I?

2288
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:07,329
[Slugworth] Because
there's no such thing

2289
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:09,523
as a little orange
man, ya nincompoop.

2290
01:38:11,391 --> 01:38:12,892
[Willy grunting]

2291
01:38:12,925 --> 01:38:14,595
[Willy] Help! [Noodle] Help!

2292
01:38:14,628 --> 01:38:16,195
[Willy] Somebody help, please!

2293
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:18,231
- Please help!
- Help!

2294
01:38:18,264 --> 01:38:20,567
Look. Look, somebody's
coming. Look.

2295
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:22,268
Willy, we're saved!

2296
01:38:32,945 --> 01:38:33,945
[Noodle panting]

2297
01:38:35,549 --> 01:38:37,917
- I'm sorry, Noodle.
- Don't be.

2298
01:38:38,918 --> 01:38:41,120
You found my family.

2299
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:43,089
A mom who loved me.

2300
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,892
That's all I ever wanted.

2301
01:38:47,894 --> 01:38:49,062
Deep breath now.

2302
01:38:50,096 --> 01:38:52,098
[both inhale deeply]

2303
01:39:03,376 --> 01:39:07,146
[Father Julius] Mmm! Exquisite.

2304
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:09,583
You mustn't let yourself
get so worked up.

2305
01:39:09,616 --> 01:39:12,085
It's just a bit of chocolate.

2306
01:39:12,118 --> 01:39:13,530
- [door opens]
- [Oompa Loompa] Correction.

2307
01:39:13,554 --> 01:39:16,856
It was actually my chocolate.

2308
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:22,362
[elevator dings]

2309
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:27,434
You have made a very
grave error, gentlemen.

2310
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:29,302
You steal from an Oompa Loompa,

2311
01:39:29,335 --> 01:39:30,403
we take back

2312
01:39:30,437 --> 01:39:31,638
a thousandfold.

2313
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:35,509
- [chocolate draining]
- [both gasping for air]

2314
01:39:39,646 --> 01:39:41,080
What's going on, Willy?

2315
01:39:42,081 --> 01:39:44,050
It's draining, Noodle.

2316
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,052
We've been saved!

2317
01:39:46,085 --> 01:39:48,154
- By who?
- I don't know.

2318
01:39:49,523 --> 01:39:51,525
By the Little Orange
Man! [chuckling]

2319
01:39:51,558 --> 01:39:52,593
- Look.
- Wh...

2320
01:39:52,626 --> 01:39:55,027
[Willy] The Little Orange Man!

2321
01:39:55,061 --> 01:39:57,464
[screaming] Thank you,
Little Orange Man! Thank you!

2322
01:39:57,498 --> 01:39:59,932
- [Willy cheering]
- [Noodle squealing]

2323
01:39:59,966 --> 01:40:01,267
[both cheering]

2324
01:40:11,043 --> 01:40:13,045
[siren ringing]

2325
01:40:14,548 --> 01:40:16,349
[brakes screech]

2326
01:40:20,621 --> 01:40:23,156
Gentlemen. Thank
goodness you're okay.

2327
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:24,491
I came as fast as I could.

2328
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:28,394
[chief grunting]

2329
01:40:33,332 --> 01:40:35,201
Whew! Car shrunk.

2330
01:40:35,234 --> 01:40:36,570
[Slugworth] I'm sure it did.

2331
01:40:36,603 --> 01:40:38,180
And you've nothing to
worry about, Chief.

2332
01:40:38,204 --> 01:40:39,606
All under control.

2333
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,983
A couple of thieves
broke in, but I'm afraid

2334
01:40:41,007 --> 01:40:44,043
they met with a
little... accident.

2335
01:40:44,076 --> 01:40:46,747
In which they died.

2336
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,449
[Prodnose chuckling]

2337
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:50,058
[chuckling] That's actually
rather good, Gerald.

2338
01:40:50,082 --> 01:40:51,628
[Willy] I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

2339
01:40:51,652 --> 01:40:53,487
Officer, would you kindly
take a look at this?

2340
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,188
Wonka!

2341
01:40:55,221 --> 01:40:56,122
[Noodle] It details every
single illegal payment

2342
01:40:56,155 --> 01:40:58,024
these men have ever made.

2343
01:40:58,057 --> 01:40:59,560
Thousands of them.

2344
01:40:59,593 --> 01:41:02,161
[scoffs] Affable, don't
listen to her. She's lyin'.

2345
01:41:02,195 --> 01:41:03,740
Well, of course she is.
[chuckles nervously]

2346
01:41:03,764 --> 01:41:05,298
[Affable] She's not, sir.

2347
01:41:05,331 --> 01:41:06,633
She's absolutely right.

2348
01:41:07,434 --> 01:41:08,435
It's incredible.

2349
01:41:09,302 --> 01:41:10,637
Oh. Well.

2350
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:12,606
Then that sounds like a case

2351
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:15,007
for the Chief of
Police. [chuckles]

2352
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:17,152
So you give it to me, Affable, I'll,
uh... I'll take it off your hands.

2353
01:41:17,176 --> 01:41:18,455
You know, save
you the paperwork.

2354
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:20,213
I can't do that,
I'm afraid, sir.

2355
01:41:20,246 --> 01:41:21,582
[chuckles] Why's that?

2356
01:41:21,615 --> 01:41:23,484
Because your name is
written down here.

2357
01:41:23,517 --> 01:41:24,551
Huh?

2358
01:41:24,585 --> 01:41:26,520
- A lot.
- Gentlemen...

2359
01:41:26,553 --> 01:41:28,263
- [Affable] You're under arrest.
- [Slugworth] Run.

2360
01:41:28,287 --> 01:41:29,399
[chief] We puttin'
handcuffs on, here?

2361
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,323
- [gasps]
- That's okay, Noodle.

2362
01:41:30,356 --> 01:41:32,091
Give it one second.

2363
01:41:32,124 --> 01:41:34,260
[Cartel exclaiming]

2364
01:41:34,293 --> 01:41:36,095
[Prodnose] What's happening?

2365
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,498
Why are we airborne?

2366
01:41:37,531 --> 01:41:38,775
[Willy] You didn't eat
any of those chocolates,

2367
01:41:38,799 --> 01:41:41,033
- did you, Mr. Slugworth?
- Why?

2368
01:41:41,067 --> 01:41:42,311
[Willy] Because
they're Hoverchocs.

2369
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:45,204
Delayed action,
but extra strong.

2370
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:47,282
[Slugworth] You think you're
very clever, don't you, Wonka?

2371
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:50,243
Well, there's a billion sovereigns
of chocolate beneath our feet.

2372
01:41:50,276 --> 01:41:51,612
We'll get the best lawyers,

2373
01:41:51,645 --> 01:41:54,046
bribe the judge, rig
the jury if we have to.

2374
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,315
We'll be fine.

2375
01:41:56,349 --> 01:41:58,017
I wish I'd thought of that.

2376
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:02,421
Hey, Noodle!

2377
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,659
[metal banging]

2378
01:42:05,692 --> 01:42:08,529
[handles squeaking]

2379
01:42:08,562 --> 01:42:10,797
- [ground rumbling]
- [crowd exclaiming]

2380
01:42:19,105 --> 01:42:21,073
[all yell]

2381
01:42:21,107 --> 01:42:22,409
[Prodnose] What is that?

2382
01:42:22,442 --> 01:42:23,653
[Slugworth crying]
It's our chocolate!

2383
01:42:23,677 --> 01:42:25,378
[Fickelgruber]
All our chocolate!

2384
01:42:25,412 --> 01:42:26,613
[Prodnose] We're ruined!

2385
01:42:26,647 --> 01:42:27,857
[Willy] Hey, don't
worry, gentlemen.

2386
01:42:27,881 --> 01:42:30,383
You'll come down eventually.

2387
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:33,386
Probably. I think.

2388
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,721
But until then,

2389
01:42:35,722 --> 01:42:38,592
ladies and gentlemen,

2390
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:42,261
- Willy Wonka and friends...
- [laughing]

2391
01:42:42,295 --> 01:42:45,732
invite you to enjoy
