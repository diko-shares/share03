2
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:34.736
There are
moments in our lives...

3
00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.072
that seem to define us.

4
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:43.495
Moments we keep going back to.

5
00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:50.210
My life before him was
so simple and decided.

6
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.924
And now, after him,
there's just...

7
00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:00.345
after.

8
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.884
Tessa!

9
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.059
Okay, what are we forgetting?

10
00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:50.437
- Hairdryer.
- Nope.

11
00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.856
Flashlight.

12
00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.567
Mom, it's college, it's
not a survival course.

13
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.904
Towels. Battery charger.
Phone charger.

14
00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:04.075
I can always drive
anything up, if you forget it.

15
00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.953
Okay, we should get going.
We have a long drive ahead.

16
00:03:07.078 --> 00:03:09.581
Let's do a last
minute room check.

17
00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:11.708
- Oh, wait, Mom...
- Thank you.

18
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.631
- We're on the right floor.
- B-22...

19
00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:01.800
B-22...
Um...

20
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.426
B-22.

21
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.136
22... there it is.

22
00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:16.397
Hi.

23
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.234
Hi. Um...

24
00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:22.987
Steph?

25
00:04:23.113 --> 00:04:25.407
In the flesh.

26
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.285
I'm Tessa.

27
00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.746
It's my new roomie.
This is Tristan.

28
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.624
Hey.
- Hi. I'm Tessa.

29
00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:35.834
Come in, we're not gonna bite.

30
00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.377
Oh, sorry.

31
00:04:37.502 --> 00:04:40.713
Uh, so this is my mom
and this is Noah.

32
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.091
- Hello.
- Hi.

33
00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:47.220
Full disclosure.

34
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:49.139
I was pretty bummed to be
paired with a freshman.

35
00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.100
Then I thought,
hello, bright side...

36
00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:53.726
I'm going to be
your spirit guide.

37
00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:56.896
We can get you into all the
best places even without a fake.

38
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:58.523
No problem.

39
00:05:03.695 --> 00:05:05.113
Mom?

40
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.667
I like your sweater.

41
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.754
Thanks, I got it from the Gap.

42
00:05:22.714 --> 00:05:24.174
Cute.

43
00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.050
We're going straight down to
the housing office right now...

44
00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:27.051
and requesting a room change.

45
00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:29.429
Wait, what are you
talking about?

46
00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:32.807
That room reeked of weed,
and you will not...

47
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:35.059
Can you please not make a scene?

48
00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:37.687
I'm not, we have worked
too hard for this...

49
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.272
Okay, okay...

50
00:05:39.397 --> 00:05:42.067
and I don't want you to be
distracted by anyone.

51
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.945
Mom, this is me
that we're talking about.

52
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:49.407
Can you please just trust me?

53
00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.328
It'll be fine, I promise...
promise.

54
00:05:57.916 --> 00:06:00.085
House is gonna be
so empty without you.

55
00:06:00.168 --> 00:06:03.171
I know. I'll miss you.

56
00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:05.298
Oh, god, I am so proud of you.

57
00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:07.175
Thanks, Mom.

58
00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.346
Okay. I love you, my baby.

59
00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.769
I'm going. See you later.

60
00:06:17.852 --> 00:06:19.020
Bye.

61
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.277
I got it.

62
00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:32.742
This is the part
I've been dreading.

63
00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.702
Me, too.

64
00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:37.622
Oh, I was actually talking about
the ride home with your mom.

65
00:06:44.462 --> 00:06:46.005
Okay.

66
00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:14.617
How much did I
freak your mom out?

67
00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:17.370
Um...

68
00:07:17.495 --> 00:07:20.373
She thinks I'm going
to be a bad influence?

69
00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:22.250
She's just very protective.

70
00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.670
It's always only
been the two of us.

71
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.591
No, no, thanks.

72
00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:33.553
See? Seems like she
has nothing to worry about.

73
00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:34.971
Your brother's cute.

74
00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:38.016
Oh, you mean Noah, no,
he's my boyfriend.

75
00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.018
Shit, sorry.

76
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.146
No, it's okay. He's a
senior in high school.

77
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:46.733
It's Tristan.
I was supposed to meet her.

78
00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:51.237
What's with all the old books?

79
00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:53.615
Who brings books to college?

80
00:07:53.698 --> 00:07:56.409
Me, I guess.

81
00:07:56.534 --> 00:08:00.538
The bookish vibe, I like that.
Alright, I'm out.

82
00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:02.373
Okay, bye.

83
00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.910
- Hi.
- Hey.

84
00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:40.412
Econ 101?

85
00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:41.746
Yeah.

86
00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:51.089
It's locked, yeah,
I already tried it.

87
00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:53.049
Right.

88
00:08:56.845 --> 00:09:01.057
Couple of early birds, huh?

89
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:04.102
Have fun in there.

90
00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:06.479
- Sorry, after you.
- Oh, after you.

91
00:09:06.604 --> 00:09:09.315
- No, no, honestly, I insist.
- No, I insist.

92
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:10.817
- No, honestly...
- My mother raised me to...

93
00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:11.776
Okay.

94
00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:17.490
Are you a first year, too?

95
00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:20.660
Yeah. Are you an Econ major?

96
00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:24.080
That's the plan, you?

97
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.624
I'm an English major.

98
00:09:28.126 --> 00:09:29.961
I'm Landon, by the way.

99
00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:31.004
Tessa, hi.

100
00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:32.964
Hi, nice to meet you.

101
00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:39.888
Good morning,
I'm Professor Alexander...

102
00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:43.558
and welcome to Econ 101.

103
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:46.478
This might be the most important
class you take here...

104
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:50.440
so I expect everyone here
to closely pay attention...

105
00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:55.153
and benefit from the 25-year
career I had on Wall Street.

106
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:56.821
Now let's get started.

107
00:10:30.188 --> 00:10:32.190
Uh, excuse me.

108
00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:35.026
Uh, I think that you're
in the wrong room.

109
00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.532
I'm in the right room.

110
00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:43.201
How did you even get in here?

111
00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:48.415
Okay. Can you please go out into
the hall, so I can get dressed?

112
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.377
Don't flatter yourself,
I'm not looking.

113
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:58.383
You took your time.

114
00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:01.803
There they are. Hey, Tessa.

115
00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:05.890
Hi, uh, can you please ask your
boyfriend to leave...

116
00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:06.933
so I can get dressed?

117
00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:09.310
Uh, not my boyfriend.
What did you say to her?

118
00:11:09.394 --> 00:11:12.021
Nothing. I've been
minding my own business.

119
00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.941
Okay, well, whoever he is.

120
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:20.196
You're going out
with us tonight.

121
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.406
Yeah, I don't know.

122
00:11:21.489 --> 00:11:24.075
I'm trying to picture
this one at a party.

123
00:11:28.329 --> 00:11:29.664
Just not seeing it.

124
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.753
You're not going to stay
in here forever, right?

125
00:11:34.878 --> 00:11:36.629
Nope.

126
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.931
The Great Gatsby...
it's a good book.

127
00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:50.685
Hate to spoil it...

128
00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:55.440
but it was all a dream.

129
00:11:57.442 --> 00:11:59.069
Actually...

130
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.906
it was all a lie.

131
00:12:21.132 --> 00:12:23.843
What's he looking at?

132
00:12:23.968 --> 00:12:27.555
Hello, can I get a
Cappuccino with almond milk...

133
00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.432
add cinnamon on
top? Sure thing.

134
00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.309
I'll have a regular
black coffee, please.

135
00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:32.393
And for you?

136
00:12:32.477 --> 00:12:33.978
Can I have
an Americano, please?

137
00:12:34.062 --> 00:12:35.146
No problem.

138
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.481
Thanks.

139
00:12:36.564 --> 00:12:37.857
Ooh, such a player.

140
00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:42.278
- Now pick it up.
- Thank you.

141
00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:43.405
You're picking us
up, right, Zed?

142
00:12:44.823 --> 00:12:46.074
When am I
picking you guys up?

143
00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:48.076
I don't know, 8:00?

144
00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:14.352
Guess what?

145
00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:16.062
Ssh!

146
00:13:18.857 --> 00:13:21.025
We're gonna go to
a party tonight.

147
00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:23.486
I don't know.

148
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.157
You're going, don't
you want to have fun?

149
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.366
Ssh!

150
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:30.910
You, ssh!

151
00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:33.538
Yeah, of course, I do.

152
00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:36.124
Then grab your shit...

153
00:13:36.207 --> 00:13:38.209
Yes, okay... okay.

154
00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:40.336
Let's get ready to party.

155
00:13:57.645 --> 00:14:00.607
What do you think? What?

156
00:14:00.732 --> 00:14:03.234
It's... it's pretty.

157
00:14:06.738 --> 00:14:12.660
Maybe it's just a
little too formal.

158
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.832
You said be myself.

159
00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:21.836
You know what, I
love it. I love it.

160
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:35.642
Oh, isn't it crazy?

161
00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:38.353
- Hey!
- Hey. What's up?

162
00:14:38.436 --> 00:14:39.521
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

163
00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:41.523
Ooh, chug, chug, chug.

164
00:14:44.526 --> 00:14:46.903
There's my baby.

165
00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.655
Wow, wow.

166
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.282
Hey, what's up?

167
00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:55.954
- Hi, Tessa.
- Hi.

168
00:14:57.872 --> 00:15:00.166
I need things to be
way less in focus.

169
00:15:05.964 --> 00:15:07.257
Do that again, do that again.

170
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.467
Do it again? I'm
dying over here.

171
00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:11.803
Do it! I want to get
it on the camera.

172
00:15:13.304 --> 00:15:15.640
Sick, bro.

173
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:25.483
Hey, guys, this is my
new roommate, Tessa.

174
00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:26.818
This is everybody.

175
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:31.823
Nice to meet you, my name's Zed.

176
00:15:31.906 --> 00:15:34.534
You've met
Hardin, and that's Molly.

177
00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:35.660
Hey.

178
00:15:35.744 --> 00:15:36.745
You want to sit down?

179
00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:39.581
Cute dress.

180
00:15:41.624 --> 00:15:46.296
Oh, yeah, and that's
Jace... the Townie.

181
00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:47.589
What's up?

182
00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:49.883
What's your major, Tessa?

183
00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:53.720
Um, I'm thinking business
or maybe economics.

184
00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:56.181
Very cool.

185
00:15:56.264 --> 00:15:58.057
You want a drink?

186
00:15:58.183 --> 00:15:59.809
I don't really drink.

187
00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:01.644
Come on, we're all
drinking, have a drink.

188
00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:03.563
She doesn't drink?
Just a shot.

189
00:16:03.688 --> 00:16:06.274
Do it, come on.
- Just a small one.

190
00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:09.694
Oh, my god, Steph, where'd
you find this girl?

191
00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:11.529
No one's talking to you.

192
00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:14.699
Oh... yes!

193
00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:21.039
Cheers to that.

194
00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:22.373
You okay?

195
00:16:22.457 --> 00:16:26.211
Ooh, babe.
Aw, poor baby.

196
00:16:26.294 --> 00:16:27.712
You're so pretty.

197
00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:33.593
Okay, so, um, guys...
truth or dare?

198
00:16:33.718 --> 00:16:35.762
What?
Truth or dare?

199
00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:37.305
- No, no!
- Come on.

200
00:16:37.388 --> 00:16:39.432
Isn't this a kid's game?

201
00:16:39.557 --> 00:16:40.725
Not the way we play.

202
00:16:41.851 --> 00:16:44.104
Hey, Tessa, truth or dare?

203
00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.606
Truth.

204
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:49.401
Craziest place you've had sex.

205
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:54.155
Um, pass.

206
00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.990
Why, it's an easy one.

207
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:06.334
Wait... are you a virgin?

208
00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:13.925
- I'll do dare.
- Dare, hm.

209
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.845
I dare you to make
out with Hardin.

210
00:17:16.928 --> 00:17:18.763
She won't do it.

211
00:17:18.847 --> 00:17:20.682
This never ends well.

212
00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:41.286
Do you want to do this?

213
00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:46.875
You having fun, Molly?

214
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.091
I'm done playing this game.

215
00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:57.343
Oooh,
sucks to suck.

216
00:18:00.263 --> 00:18:01.765
I like this girl.

217
00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:06.394
Hardin Scott got
his first rejection.

218
00:18:06.478 --> 00:18:07.896
Denied, bro.

219
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.158
Hey.

220
00:18:20.283 --> 00:18:22.368
Hey, I
thought we were gonna Facetime?

221
00:18:22.494 --> 00:18:24.662
Yeah, sorry.

222
00:18:24.746 --> 00:18:27.874
Where are you right
now? It's really loud.

223
00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:32.003
Um, I'm with Steph,
and her friends...

224
00:18:32.087 --> 00:18:36.841
but they're all just
like... I don't know.

225
00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:39.344
So, you're at a party?

226
00:18:39.469 --> 00:18:40.512
Have you been drinking?

227
00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:41.679
I just had one drink.

228
00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:45.100
Okay, so you go to college...

229
00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:47.060
and now you drink, that's...
that's really great, Tessa.

230
00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:48.686
Noah, can you not be so like...

231
00:18:48.812 --> 00:18:51.815
So like what? I'm not the one
who's out partying right now.

232
00:18:51.898 --> 00:18:54.067
Just forget it.
- Tessa, I want...

233
00:18:58.154 --> 00:18:59.906
My bad.

234
00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:00.383
- What are you doing?
- Hm?

235
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.012
Nothing.

236
00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:08.099
Are you looking for something?

237
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.937
Are you drunk?

238
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:16.524
I don't drink...
just like you don't.

239
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:28.161
"He's more myself than I am.
Whatever our souls are made of.

240
00:20:28.286 --> 00:20:31.206
"His and mine are the same."

241
00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:36.211
It's Bronte, Teresa?

242
00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:42.383
I know it's Bronte...

243
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.556
and my name is Tessa.

244
00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:53.937
What were you doing
in my room, Tessa?

245
00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:57.232
Your room?

246
00:20:57.315 --> 00:20:58.942
Yes.

247
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.999
Are we still playing?

248
00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:20.422
'Cause I think
you owe me a dare.

249
00:21:38.773 --> 00:21:43.194
Wait, I can't.

250
00:21:47.407 --> 00:21:48.700
I need to go.

251
00:22:03.047 --> 00:22:04.340
Don't
doubt me, I got this...

252
00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:06.342
look, look, here we go, ready?

253
00:22:06.426 --> 00:22:08.219
Oh! Nice
shot, all right.

254
00:23:28.758 --> 00:23:30.260
Hi.

255
00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:34.013
Hey, I'm glad I'm not the
only freshman in this class.

256
00:23:34.139 --> 00:23:36.057
Yeah, I'm psyched
I got in. Yeah.

257
00:23:36.141 --> 00:23:39.602
All right, folks,
let's get started...

258
00:23:39.686 --> 00:23:42.313
Jane Austen's masterpiece.

259
00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:46.276
Who in here has already
read Pride and Prejudice?

260
00:23:48.486 --> 00:23:52.198
And what did you think
of it on the first read?

261
00:23:52.323 --> 00:23:57.912
Let's hear from our
newcomer, Mr. Scott.

262
00:23:57.996 --> 00:24:02.667
Pride and Prejudice... Elizabeth
Bennett needs to chill.

263
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:07.380
She gave Darcy a way worse
time than he deserved.

264
00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:11.301
Are you saying that Darcy was
not in love with Elizabeth?

265
00:24:11.384 --> 00:24:15.305
Love is just a transaction...

266
00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:17.807
we're all hardwired to desire.

267
00:24:17.891 --> 00:24:22.353
We present the correct set of
desirable traits and boom...

268
00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:25.774
we can turn it on and
we can turn it off.

269
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.321
Yes. Ms. Young? Tessa?

270
00:24:31.404 --> 00:24:36.034
I think that it was the most
revolutionary feminist novel...

271
00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:39.871
that I've ever read, that a
woman of that era would have...

272
00:24:39.954 --> 00:24:42.749
the strength to reject Darcy
when he treated her poorly.

273
00:24:42.874 --> 00:24:43.875
That's a load.

274
00:24:47.754 --> 00:24:50.965
It was Darcy's very attitude
that attracted Elizabeth to him.

275
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:52.801
Darcy's attitude was
rude and mocking.

276
00:24:52.884 --> 00:24:54.511
I think that he was lucky
to be with a woman...

277
00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:56.429
with as much integrity
as Elizabeth.

278
00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:58.389
The only reason he even
asked her to marry him...

279
00:24:58.515 --> 00:25:00.475
was 'cause she wouldn't
stop throwing herself...

280
00:25:00.558 --> 00:25:02.727
Throwing herself at him?
He was pursuing her.

281
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.521
She's clearly not
satisfied with her life...

282
00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:06.648
and is looking for excitement
wherever she can get it.

283
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.983
Well, I think that it's
obviously all in his head...

284
00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:11.361
that she had any
feelings for him at all.

285
00:25:11.444 --> 00:25:14.197
Well, there you have it.

286
00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:19.661
That's the power of a good book.

287
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.084
That was exciting.

288
00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:28.545
No, it was annoying.

289
00:25:28.628 --> 00:25:29.712
I enjoyed it.

290
00:25:29.796 --> 00:25:31.881
Look, whatever you're
thinking, don't.

291
00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:34.926
Nothing happened between us.
Okay? I have a boyfriend.

292
00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:39.347
Us... I thought we were talking
about Pride and Prejudice.

293
00:25:46.813 --> 00:25:50.817
Hey, do you want to
go get some coffee?

294
00:25:50.942 --> 00:25:53.111
How can someone be so arrogant?

295
00:25:53.236 --> 00:25:55.655
"Elizabeth Bennett
needs to chill."

296
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.951
Like who even...
who even says that?

297
00:26:00.034 --> 00:26:02.662
That's just Hardin
being Hardin.

298
00:26:02.787 --> 00:26:04.164
You know him?

299
00:26:04.289 --> 00:26:09.461
Yeah, we're, uh, we're
practically related.

300
00:26:09.544 --> 00:26:13.506
My mom is dating
Chancellor Scott.

301
00:26:13.631 --> 00:26:16.968
Chancellor Scott
is Hardin's dad...

302
00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:21.556
and Hardin and I, we tolerate
each other, but barely.

303
00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:24.434
His father's the chancellor?

304
00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:25.894
Yeah.

305
00:26:29.564 --> 00:26:33.318
Listen, Tessa, he's just
trying to get a reaction.

306
00:26:33.443 --> 00:26:36.654
Well, he's not gonna
get one from me.

307
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.783
Hm...

308
00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.747
Agh!

309
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.415
It actually does hurt.

310
00:26:50.001 --> 00:26:51.336
You should get one.

311
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.256
My mom would literally kill me.

312
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.716
You need to get this.

313
00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:02.138
I bet you'd love that one.

314
00:27:02.222 --> 00:27:05.016
Yeah, dice...

315
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.769
I feel like my mom has
everything planned out for me.

316
00:27:07.852 --> 00:27:11.189
Like, I think she's been
planning my wedding

317
00:27:11.314 --> 00:27:14.025
to Noah since we were five.

318
00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:17.946
Wait, is Noah the only dude
you've ever gone out with?

319
00:27:20.865 --> 00:27:22.784
That's sad.

320
00:27:26.955 --> 00:27:28.164
Ooh, ow!

321
00:27:28.248 --> 00:27:29.999
Watch it.

322
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:33.545
Yeah, you guys really
aren't selling me on this.

323
00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:46.057
Ssh! You
look so good tonight.

324
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:48.893
Shh!

325
00:28:16.337 --> 00:28:18.423
Can I get a
small coffee, please?

326
00:28:25.972 --> 00:28:27.807
Here you go.

327
00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:29.434
Yeah, thanks.

328
00:28:42.322 --> 00:28:45.450
- Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:28:45.533 --> 00:28:47.619
I can't stay away from you.

330
00:28:50.413 --> 00:28:52.457
What?

331
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.376
Well, we're gonna
see each other.

332
00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.421
I'm friends with Steph
and you're roommates.

333
00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:05.095
Tessa, let's just start over,
just reset and we can be...

334
00:29:05.178 --> 00:29:07.347
What... friends?

335
00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:09.140
Why not?

336
00:29:12.394 --> 00:29:14.145
I want to show you something.

337
00:29:14.229 --> 00:29:16.856
So show me then.

338
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:19.776
It's a... it's a place.

339
00:29:21.444 --> 00:29:26.950
I think that it's better
if we keep our distance.

340
00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:36.000
I'll see you around.

341
00:30:46.362 --> 00:30:50.450
It's down this way. Come on.

342
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:29.948
Welcome to my favorite place.

343
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.284
It's beautiful.

344
00:31:41.376 --> 00:31:44.796
- How about a swim?
- Hm?

345
00:31:51.803 --> 00:31:54.597
What are... what are you doing?

346
00:31:54.723 --> 00:31:56.057
I'm going swimming.

347
00:31:59.894 --> 00:32:01.771
Hardin...

348
00:32:07.944 --> 00:32:08.820
Hardin.

349
00:32:12.157 --> 00:32:13.158
Come in.

350
00:32:15.827 --> 00:32:17.662
You can wear my t-shirt.

351
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:23.835
It feels amazing.

352
00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.351
A little privacy, please?

353
00:32:50.945 --> 00:32:52.322
Okay.

354
00:32:58.119 --> 00:32:59.037
What?

355
00:33:02.207 --> 00:33:04.209
I like it better on you.

356
00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:47.168
Can I ask you something?

357
00:33:47.252 --> 00:33:49.087
Do I even have a choice?

358
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:56.594
Who do you love the
most in the world?

359
00:33:56.678 --> 00:33:59.931
Easy... myself.

360
00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:04.728
Of course, you do.

361
00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:09.566
What's your boyfriend's name?

362
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:11.192
It's Noah.

363
00:34:11.276 --> 00:34:15.613
Noah... does he go here?

364
00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:17.449
He's in high school.

365
00:34:17.532 --> 00:34:20.201
High school?

366
00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:23.621
And what does a high school
kid do to deserve you?

367
00:34:23.705 --> 00:34:26.291
He is nice to me.

368
00:34:26.374 --> 00:34:28.126
Nice?

369
00:34:29.753 --> 00:34:32.464
Isn't that just another
word for boring?

370
00:34:34.632 --> 00:34:36.760
Not always.

371
00:34:36.843 --> 00:34:39.804
Can I show you something?

372
00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:45.101
Hold your breath.

373
00:35:04.496 --> 00:35:09.000
Silence... it's peaceful.

374
00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:14.047
You think that's weird?

375
00:35:15.799 --> 00:35:19.260
No... not at all.

376
00:36:00.343 --> 00:36:04.514
I thought that you just
wanted to be friends.

377
00:36:08.935 --> 00:36:11.479
I don't think we can
ever be just friends.

378
00:38:10.223 --> 00:38:12.684
Have you never been
touched before?

379
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.325
Why'd you stop?

380
00:38:32.787 --> 00:38:35.081
We've got time.

381
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.046
So, why do you
call them "chips"?

382
00:38:42.172 --> 00:38:44.048
Why do you call them "fries"?

383
00:38:44.132 --> 00:38:45.008
Because they're fried.

384
00:38:45.133 --> 00:38:47.969
They're not French.

385
00:38:48.053 --> 00:38:51.556
You've got plenty there.

386
00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:53.725
Hey, uh, I ordered
mine without ketchup.

387
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:54.893
Oh, right, I'll be right back.

388
00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:57.103
Thank you.

389
00:38:57.228 --> 00:39:00.732
No ketchup?
That's very un-American.

390
00:39:00.857 --> 00:39:02.609
I'm full of surprises.

391
00:39:05.737 --> 00:39:08.823
So... what's your story then?

392
00:39:08.907 --> 00:39:10.325
My story?

393
00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:16.623
Yeah. Like, your family?
How you ended up here?

394
00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:18.416
Pass.

395
00:39:21.711 --> 00:39:25.715
I just don't think asking a
bunch of arbitrary questions...

396
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.928
about someone's past is really
gonna tell you who they are.

397
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:33.098
I can find out who you
are by sitting here...

398
00:39:33.223 --> 00:39:35.100
and spending time with you.

399
00:39:42.482 --> 00:39:43.525
What?

400
00:39:45.026 --> 00:39:46.778
What?

401
00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:49.155
What are you doing?

402
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.283
I'm just waiting for you to
reveal your true self to me...

403
00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:55.745
by just sitting here and
spending time with you.

404
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:56.913
Here you go.

405
00:39:56.996 --> 00:39:59.416
Thank you.

406
00:39:59.499 --> 00:40:03.628
Okay, fair enough...
one question.

407
00:40:06.297 --> 00:40:08.007
Why do you have all
those romance novels...

408
00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:09.676
if you don't believe in love?

409
00:40:09.801 --> 00:40:11.344
Who says I don't
believe in love?

410
00:40:12.262 --> 00:40:15.140
You did, in Soto's class.

411
00:40:17.642 --> 00:40:19.060
True.

412
00:40:21.187 --> 00:40:24.315
Maybe don't believe
everything I say then.

413
00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:26.693
Oh, hey, guys.

414
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.238
Hey, Tessa.

415
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:37.078
Guys, let's just hang
out for a minute.

416
00:40:37.162 --> 00:40:39.789
So... what have
you two been up to?

417
00:40:39.873 --> 00:40:42.792
- We were just...
- We're just getting some food.

418
00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:45.837
Oh, how's the boyfriend, Tess?

419
00:40:45.962 --> 00:40:47.839
We're leaving.

420
00:40:47.922 --> 00:40:49.382
Perfect. I need a ride.

421
00:40:49.466 --> 00:40:52.135
It's not a good time, you
can ask Zed for a ride.

422
00:40:52.218 --> 00:40:53.845
Dude, we literally
just got here.

423
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.055
Excuse me.

424
00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.181
You're excused.

425
00:40:59.267 --> 00:41:03.563
All right... Tessa?

426
00:41:04.064 --> 00:41:05.774
Really?

427
00:41:08.359 --> 00:41:11.112
Yes, I won't be long.

428
00:41:19.704 --> 00:41:20.914
I'll be at the bar.

429
00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:22.874
See you around.

430
00:41:26.878 --> 00:41:27.921
What's up, bro?

431
00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:29.631
So, fill us in.

432
00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:38.390
- What was that?
- What was what?

433
00:41:38.473 --> 00:41:41.476
Were you like embarrassed
that they saw us together?

434
00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:43.395
No.

435
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.360
You know, I'm going to tell
Noah about us, I just...

436
00:41:50.485 --> 00:41:56.199
Us? What do you mean "us"?

437
00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:58.868
If you want to dump Mr. High
School, then go ahead...

438
00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:00.245
but don't do it on my account.

439
00:42:03.456 --> 00:42:04.499
What?

440
00:42:06.418 --> 00:42:09.671
Look, it was fun,
but I don't date.

441
00:42:16.094 --> 00:42:20.682
Are you actually kidding me?

442
00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:00.532
You're here.

443
00:44:20.218 --> 00:44:22.137
What are you dreaming about?

444
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:38.903
Surprise!

445
00:44:38.987 --> 00:44:44.492
What... what are you...
what are you doing here?

446
00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:48.830
How are you?

447
00:44:50.915 --> 00:44:52.667
Thank you.

448
00:44:54.294 --> 00:44:56.421
Are you okay?

449
00:44:56.546 --> 00:44:59.132
Yeah. No, yeah, yeah, of course.

450
00:44:59.215 --> 00:45:00.592
- Okay.
- Thank you.

451
00:45:00.717 --> 00:45:01.593
Yeah.

452
00:45:02.552 --> 00:45:03.887
So, what are we gonna do?

453
00:45:18.276 --> 00:45:20.070
Hey,
there's Tessa.

454
00:45:20.153 --> 00:45:21.237
What's
up, Tessa?

455
00:45:21.321 --> 00:45:22.447
Hey.

456
00:45:23.823 --> 00:45:27.160
Hi.
We met at the dorm.

457
00:45:27.243 --> 00:45:29.370
- So, he does exist.
- Nice to meet you.

458
00:45:29.454 --> 00:45:30.497
What's up, man, it's
Zed, how's it going?

459
00:45:30.622 --> 00:45:31.623
Good, how are you doing?

460
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.629
Cool, campfire.

461
00:45:37.754 --> 00:45:38.755
Tessa.

462
00:45:38.838 --> 00:45:39.672
Thanks.

463
00:45:41.633 --> 00:45:43.635
Cops will probably
be here soon, so...

464
00:45:43.718 --> 00:45:46.304
Oh, should we get out of here?

465
00:45:54.938 --> 00:45:58.024
Hey, Tessa, didn't
expect to see you here.

466
00:46:03.196 --> 00:46:07.033
So, how about we play a
game of Suck and Blow?

467
00:46:07.158 --> 00:46:09.494
Suck and Blow, I'm down.

468
00:46:09.577 --> 00:46:10.870
Okay, I got it.

469
00:46:14.332 --> 00:46:17.001
- Yes!
- Aww.

470
00:46:17.085 --> 00:46:19.337
Guess you know what that
means. Oh, no, no, I'm...

471
00:46:19.462 --> 00:46:20.839
Whoa, dude, dude, dude...

472
00:46:21.923 --> 00:46:22.966
Leave it, Jace.
Don't go there, all right?

473
00:46:23.049 --> 00:46:24.551
Chill out, man,
it's just a game, man.

474
00:46:24.676 --> 00:46:26.302
- Hey, man, she doesn't have...
- Leave it, Jace.

475
00:46:26.386 --> 00:46:27.053
Relax, dude. Hey, relax.

476
00:46:30.432 --> 00:46:32.434
Whoa! Hey!

477
00:46:34.477 --> 00:46:37.772
Hey, hey, hey, get off!

478
00:46:39.649 --> 00:46:41.484
You're
gonna regret this.

479
00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:44.863
Dude, you're freaking!
What are you doing, man?

480
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:49.200
- Hardin?
- Hardin?

481
00:47:01.546 --> 00:47:04.215
And the referee
gives a yellow card!

482
00:47:07.552 --> 00:47:09.721
This crowd is not happy at all.

483
00:47:56.434 --> 00:47:58.269
Hey, thanks for coming.

484
00:47:58.353 --> 00:47:59.854
What happened?

485
00:47:59.938 --> 00:48:04.275
Uh, well, it started
about his father

486
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:08.696
and then your name
sort of came up.

487
00:48:11.408 --> 00:48:12.784
He won't talk to me

488
00:48:12.909 --> 00:48:17.956
so I figured maybe
he would talk to you.

489
00:48:18.081 --> 00:48:19.999
Where is he?

490
00:48:39.185 --> 00:48:41.354
What are you doing here?

491
00:48:41.479 --> 00:48:43.648
I was worried about you.

492
00:48:47.318 --> 00:48:48.611
Shouldn't you be
with your perfect

493
00:48:48.737 --> 00:48:50.155
little boyfriend, Teresa?

494
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.990
Don't bring Noah into this.

495
00:48:54.451 --> 00:48:56.035
I thought you didn't drink.

496
00:48:56.119 --> 00:48:57.787
I don't.

497
00:48:59.372 --> 00:49:02.542
I didn't what does it matter?

498
00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:04.711
You made a real mess in there.

499
00:49:04.794 --> 00:49:08.214
I was celebrating.
Didn't you hear?

500
00:49:12.385 --> 00:49:15.472
Dear old Dad is getting married.

501
00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:18.600
You should see the dump my poor
mom lives in back in London.

502
00:49:24.647 --> 00:49:27.692
Don't you feel like
you've had enough?

503
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:46.920
Don't, I can get it.

504
00:49:47.045 --> 00:49:48.213
Ow, damn it.

505
00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:56.388
Come with me.

506
00:50:17.826 --> 00:50:20.912
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

507
00:50:25.166 --> 00:50:31.881
Um, if... if you don't date,
if that's how you feel...

508
00:50:35.051 --> 00:50:38.012
I don't think that is
how I feel anymore.

509
00:50:43.393 --> 00:50:45.186
I'm a mess.

510
00:50:50.108 --> 00:50:52.777
I think that we're both a mess.

511
00:51:51.836 --> 00:51:56.091
You don't ever have to
cover up, not for me.

512
00:53:41.279 --> 00:53:43.573
Hey. You okay?

513
00:53:43.656 --> 00:53:45.075
Yeah.

514
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.118
Where were you, I texted
you, you didn't answer me.

515
00:53:47.243 --> 00:53:49.996
Um, I'm sorry. My
phone died, I'm sorry.

516
00:53:50.121 --> 00:53:51.623
Where were you?

517
00:53:51.706 --> 00:53:54.834
A friend needed my help.

518
00:53:54.959 --> 00:53:56.378
But... in the middle
of the night?

519
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.062
Noah, I can explain, can we...

520
00:54:16.481 --> 00:54:20.777
Please, can we just...
can we just go inside and talk?

521
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.112
I don't...

522
00:54:22.195 --> 00:54:23.530
No...

523
00:54:23.613 --> 00:54:26.074
I don't believe this.

524
00:54:26.157 --> 00:54:30.203
No, Noah...
Noah, wait.

525
00:54:30.286 --> 00:54:32.997
Noah, I'm...
I'm confused.

526
00:54:33.123 --> 00:54:36.918
I wanted to talk to you
about it for a while.

527
00:54:37.001 --> 00:54:39.504
I am so, so sorry.

528
00:54:47.637 --> 00:54:49.347
Noah...

529
00:55:01.818 --> 00:55:02.986
Tessa...

530
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:05.655
Go home, Hardin.

531
00:55:27.677 --> 00:55:31.723
Noah and I just broke up.

532
00:55:34.267 --> 00:55:37.395
I feel like I just
lost my best friend.

533
00:55:40.231 --> 00:55:42.484
Come over here.

534
00:57:10.822 --> 00:57:12.741
I didn't expect to see you.

535
00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:29.132
When my dad left, I was 10.

536
00:57:33.344 --> 00:57:37.265
He left us with nothing.

537
00:57:40.143 --> 00:57:46.107
And my mom, she just
sort of fell apart.

538
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:51.988
I had to take
care of her alone

539
00:57:52.113 --> 00:57:56.117
but Noah was there
for me, you know?

540
00:57:59.537 --> 00:58:02.373
I hate myself for
what I did to him.

541
00:58:03.833 --> 00:58:06.878
Tessa, it's not your fault.

542
00:58:07.003 --> 00:58:09.839
Yeah, it is.

543
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.181
Noah's my best friend.

544
00:58:22.477 --> 00:58:24.229
But you...

545
00:58:30.402 --> 00:58:32.404
You're so much more.

546
00:58:42.205 --> 00:58:43.581
Library is closing.

547
00:58:43.665 --> 00:58:45.917
Library is
getting ready to close.

548
00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:47.919
Library is closing!

549
00:58:51.047 --> 00:58:53.049
- Follow me.
- Hm?

550
00:58:53.174 --> 00:58:54.592
- Come on.
- What are...

551
00:58:54.718 --> 00:58:56.386
Down here.

552
00:58:59.055 --> 00:59:01.224
Ssh.

553
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:16.281
"You could draw me to fire.
You could draw me to water.

554
00:59:16.364 --> 00:59:18.408
"You could draw
me to the gallows.

555
00:59:18.533 --> 00:59:20.744
"You could draw me to any death.

556
00:59:20.827 --> 00:59:23.455
"You could draw me to
anything I've most avoided.

557
00:59:23.538 --> 00:59:26.750
"This and the confusion
of my thoughts.

558
00:59:26.833 --> 00:59:30.086
"So that time fit for
nothing is what I mean

559
00:59:30.211 --> 00:59:33.840
"by your being the ruin of me."

560
00:59:33.923 --> 00:59:37.677
Why'd you stop?

561
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:40.013
We should go.

562
00:59:46.269 --> 00:59:50.315
Hey! What are you
doing here? Stop!

563
01:00:48.373 --> 01:00:51.501
Perhaps the most
mesmerizing of all things

564
01:00:51.626 --> 01:00:54.504
is the binary star couple.

565
01:00:54.587 --> 01:00:58.341
Two stars find their way
across vast stretches of space

566
01:00:58.466 --> 01:01:01.428
and time to find
another wandering body

567
01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:05.473
and become attached for
eternity in each others' orbit.

568
01:01:05.557 --> 01:01:11.479
Each star pushing the other
to explode in supernova...

569
01:01:16.651 --> 01:01:19.863
becoming either the
nucleus of planetary nebula

570
01:01:19.988 --> 01:01:23.742
or just as often,
resulting in a death spiral.

571
01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:28.872
What are you doing,
Tessa? Learning about the stars?

572
01:01:28.955 --> 01:01:34.169
The stars assist
in each others' system.

573
01:01:34.252 --> 01:01:38.923
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are right now?

574
01:01:45.388 --> 01:01:47.849
What are you always
writing in there?

575
01:01:47.932 --> 01:01:49.768
None of your business.

576
01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:01.112
- Show me.
- No.

577
01:02:03.073 --> 01:02:05.075
- Come on!
- No chance!

578
01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:06.868
I just want to see what's...

579
01:03:13.184 --> 01:03:15.478
Tessa, hun?

580
01:03:15.603 --> 01:03:17.063
I've called all the... Tessa?

581
01:03:17.147 --> 01:03:20.608
Mom? What are you doing here?

582
01:03:20.692 --> 01:03:22.986
What the hell is going on?

583
01:03:23.111 --> 01:03:24.320
Nothing.

584
01:03:24.446 --> 01:03:26.740
Who's he? Is he the
guy Noah told me about?

585
01:03:26.823 --> 01:03:29.826
So this is how you spend your
time instead of going to class?

586
01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:31.286
No!
- I think I should go.

587
01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:32.537
You think?

588
01:03:32.662 --> 01:03:35.957
Can we talk about this
outside please? Please!

589
01:03:37.709 --> 01:03:40.003
You, go! Come with me.

590
01:03:44.632 --> 01:03:46.718
You have got to be kidding me.

591
01:03:46.843 --> 01:03:48.720
I knew as soon as I
saw that roommate

592
01:03:48.845 --> 01:03:50.138
that something like
this would happen.

593
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:52.098
Are you serious right now?

594
01:03:52.182 --> 01:03:53.767
And after all this work

595
01:03:53.892 --> 01:03:57.437
and you are gonna throw
it away for some boy!

596
01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.522
What are you talking
about? I'm not.

597
01:04:01.066 --> 01:04:03.109
You're going to break
up with this boy

598
01:04:03.193 --> 01:04:06.696
and you are going to
focus on your schoolwork.

599
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.870
Do you even know what it
has been like trying to be

600
01:04:13.953 --> 01:04:17.874
perfect for you,
having you mold my life

601
01:04:17.957 --> 01:04:20.668
into the way that
you wanted it to be?

602
01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:23.922
I did it for your own good.

603
01:04:24.005 --> 01:04:28.051
I am so, so sorry, Mom, that
your life didn't work out

604
01:04:28.176 --> 01:04:31.930
the way that you wanted
it to, I really am

605
01:04:32.055 --> 01:04:35.100
but this is my life and
you have to let me live it.

606
01:04:40.522 --> 01:04:43.233
Is that really what you want?

607
01:04:43.358 --> 01:04:45.568
Yes.

608
01:04:54.536 --> 01:05:00.125
If I leave now, you're cut off.

609
01:05:06.715 --> 01:05:09.050
He's gonna break your heart.

610
01:05:29.904 --> 01:05:32.490
She's cutting
you off because of Hardin.

611
01:05:32.615 --> 01:05:35.160
I'm just a little
worried, is all?

612
01:05:35.285 --> 01:05:37.454
Why?

613
01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:40.040
Hardin is...

614
01:05:40.165 --> 01:05:43.585
Hardin is complicated.

615
01:05:43.668 --> 01:05:48.048
Yeah, I know, but he's
different around me.

616
01:05:48.131 --> 01:05:50.091
Just be careful.

617
01:06:04.314 --> 01:06:05.648
You okay?

618
01:06:05.732 --> 01:06:08.109
Yeah. Where have you been?

619
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.698
Jump in and I'll show you.

620
01:06:20.455 --> 01:06:21.790
- You ready?
- Yes!

621
01:06:21.873 --> 01:06:24.125
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

622
01:06:30.757 --> 01:06:32.217
Who's place is this?

623
01:06:34.928 --> 01:06:39.349
A friend of my
father's, a professor.

624
01:06:39.474 --> 01:06:41.976
Where are they?

625
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:48.066
She's in Italy. Oh yeah, I'm
meant to be watering the plants.

626
01:06:51.319 --> 01:06:52.904
Ooh, she paints.

627
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.998
It's really nice.

628
01:07:07.585 --> 01:07:09.879
Imagine if it were our place.

629
01:07:09.963 --> 01:07:12.507
Sure.

630
01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:14.426
It can be.

631
01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:21.099
What, you mean,
like live together?

632
01:07:26.896 --> 01:07:28.898
When you told me your mom
was going to cut you off

633
01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:30.650
I had to do something.

634
01:07:30.734 --> 01:07:33.778
We can stay here for
the rest of the year

635
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.948
just you and me.

636
01:07:43.246 --> 01:07:45.290
You did this for me?

637
01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:11.149
- Here.
- Mm-hm.

638
01:08:18.907 --> 01:08:20.992
You're gonna bring out
the best of our loves.

639
01:08:21.117 --> 01:08:21.951
Mm-hm.

640
01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:28.500
Whoa!

641
01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:24.889
Look at that one.
It looks a bit like you.

642
01:09:26.516 --> 01:09:29.978
This is crazy.

643
01:09:45.535 --> 01:09:47.954
I still can't believe it.

644
01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:49.873
Hm? Believe what?

645
01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.335
That you're mine.

646
01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:58.381
Not this again.

647
01:10:02.385 --> 01:10:04.262
I don't deserve you.

648
01:10:07.474 --> 01:10:12.854
Nothing could ever change the
way that I feel about you.

649
01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:35.001
- I can not believe you've
talked me into this.

650
01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:38.922
- It's a wedding reception,
it's not a jail sentence.

651
01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:43.218
Hey!

652
01:10:43.301 --> 01:10:45.178
- Hey, you guys made it.
- Yeah.

653
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:48.139
- You look beautiful, Tessa.
- Oh, thank you.

654
01:10:48.264 --> 01:10:49.599
Hey, you clean up well, man.

655
01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:52.143
This is so fancy.

656
01:10:53.144 --> 01:10:54.938
Yeah, it's beautiful.

657
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.440
So we're brothers.

658
01:10:59.442 --> 01:11:00.610
Yeah.

659
01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:05.448
You must be really happy
for your mom and Ken.

660
01:11:05.573 --> 01:11:07.992
Yeah, yeah, I am.

661
01:11:09.953 --> 01:11:11.955
I'll see you two in there.

662
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:22.006
This looks so good.

663
01:11:38.148 --> 01:11:42.277
Look who's here.
It's good to see you.

664
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.653
You, too.

665
01:11:43.737 --> 01:11:45.780
And you must be...
- Tessa.

666
01:11:45.864 --> 01:11:47.031
Tessa.
Tessa, I'm Karen.

667
01:11:47.157 --> 01:11:48.199
- Hi.
- I'm Landon's mom.

668
01:11:48.324 --> 01:11:49.868
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

669
01:11:49.993 --> 01:11:51.619
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

670
01:11:53.163 --> 01:11:55.790
It means a lot to me
that you could be here.

671
01:11:55.874 --> 01:11:57.751
Congratulations.

672
01:11:57.834 --> 01:11:59.961
Thanks for coming.

673
01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:04.466
I'm happy you decided
to join us, son.

674
01:12:04.549 --> 01:12:06.718
Landon tells us you're in
Professor Soto's seminar.

675
01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:07.969
Yeah.

676
01:12:08.053 --> 01:12:10.138
So, you're an English major?

677
01:12:10.221 --> 01:12:13.641
Um, I would love to, but I think
if I want to be employed

678
01:12:13.725 --> 01:12:16.561
maybe business or econ.

679
01:12:16.686 --> 01:12:18.688
If you're interested in the
business side of literature

680
01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:20.815
my friend owns a
publishing company.

681
01:12:20.899 --> 01:12:22.776
You mean Vance?
- Yes.

682
01:12:22.859 --> 01:12:24.652
Well, I can call Vance for her.

683
01:12:24.736 --> 01:12:27.322
Of course, I'm sure he'd
be happy to hear from you.

684
01:12:29.324 --> 01:12:34.079
Ken, Dana's arrived.
I think we should go say hi.

685
01:12:35.997 --> 01:12:37.332
Enjoy.

686
01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.086
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.

687
01:12:49.052 --> 01:12:51.805
Let's just have fun.

688
01:12:51.888 --> 01:12:54.557
I can't.

689
01:12:54.641 --> 01:12:57.310
Why not?

690
01:12:57.394 --> 01:13:00.230
You made me promise to
be on my best behavior.

691
01:13:34.806 --> 01:13:37.142
Thank you all for coming.

692
01:13:37.267 --> 01:13:40.937
Tonight we celebrate
great, good fortune

693
01:13:41.062 --> 01:13:44.399
and her name is Karen.

694
01:13:44.482 --> 01:13:48.236
The love of my life and...
and frankly she saved my life.

695
01:13:48.319 --> 01:13:53.700
I'm suddenly blessed by a
new bride, a new life and

696
01:13:53.783 --> 01:13:57.245
not one, but two
brilliant sons...

697
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.624
Hardin and Landon.

698
01:14:04.169 --> 01:14:06.629
I remember an earlier time
when my greatest pleasure

699
01:14:06.755 --> 01:14:11.301
was to listen to Hardin,
who loved to recite passages

700
01:14:11.426 --> 01:14:13.386
from novels, all by memory

701
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:17.015
and he would perform
them, leaving me with tears...

702
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.768
He's not the man I grew up with.
- or laughter.

703
01:14:20.727 --> 01:14:24.147
My father was a drunk
and nothing more.

704
01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:30.070
At least he's trying

705
01:14:30.153 --> 01:14:32.489
which is more than
my father ever did.

706
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.826
People change.

707
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.997
Clearly, but that still
doesn't change what happened.

708
01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:47.712
What happened?

709
01:14:52.008 --> 01:14:54.219
One night, when I was eight

710
01:14:59.057 --> 01:15:02.644
my dad was at the pub,
drunk as usual.

711
01:15:03.853 --> 01:15:07.107
He messed with the wrong guys.

712
01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:09.651
They came to our
house for payback.

713
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.321
He wasn't there.

714
01:15:16.199 --> 01:15:17.700
They found my mom instead.

715
01:15:20.704 --> 01:15:22.747
I tried...

716
01:15:27.752 --> 01:15:30.839
I tried to fight them
off, but I couldn't.

717
01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:38.680
Thank you, my friends, my
family and university faculty.

718
01:15:38.763 --> 01:15:43.727
And that's my dad, the
beloved Chancellor Scott.

719
01:15:44.477 --> 01:15:47.856
Let's have fun!

720
01:15:56.573 --> 01:16:00.827
I don't suppose you recall
any of those passages.

721
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:05.331
Not the way you remember it.

722
01:16:05.415 --> 01:16:08.960
I would love to have a dance
with your brilliant son.

723
01:17:46.182 --> 01:17:47.892
I want you now.

724
01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:32.437
Are you sure?

725
01:18:34.147 --> 01:18:36.399
Yeah.

726
01:18:55.502 --> 01:18:57.420
Do you want me to stop?

727
01:18:59.839 --> 01:19:02.133
No, just go slow.

728
01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:29.953
- Car.
- It was "cat".

729
01:19:30.078 --> 01:19:31.746
Do another one.

730
01:19:38.461 --> 01:19:42.549
Uh-that one is...

731
01:19:44.509 --> 01:19:48.430
- I have no idea!
- I'm really good at this, yeah.

732
01:19:48.513 --> 01:19:51.015
Okay, just do one more,
I promise, I'll get it.

733
01:20:06.114 --> 01:20:08.366
Um...

734
01:20:20.336 --> 01:20:25.967
Hm I don't know, what was it?

735
01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:48.865
Can always stay up
late and work on that.

736
01:20:48.948 --> 01:20:50.742
- I'll just see you.
- I'll text you.

737
01:21:04.422 --> 01:21:06.049
Hey.

738
01:21:06.174 --> 01:21:07.884
Hey.

739
01:21:08.009 --> 01:21:10.095
How's it going? I haven't seen
you since like the bonfire.

740
01:21:11.554 --> 01:21:14.933
Yeah, I've been busy, I guess.

741
01:21:16.643 --> 01:21:19.229
How's it going with you
and your boyfriend?

742
01:21:20.647 --> 01:21:24.401
Uh, we're not together anymore.

743
01:21:24.526 --> 01:21:27.195
Ouch. Bye-bye, high school.

744
01:21:27.278 --> 01:21:28.905
Yeah, it was pretty painful.

745
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:32.992
Yeah, I can tell you
moved on pretty quickly.

746
01:21:33.076 --> 01:21:34.411
How's Hardin?

747
01:21:34.536 --> 01:21:35.787
What do you mean?

748
01:21:35.912 --> 01:21:38.123
He told me you guys
have been hanging out.

749
01:21:38.248 --> 01:21:40.291
Yeah, we have.

750
01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:43.628
Cool.

751
01:21:45.088 --> 01:21:46.840
Really?

752
01:21:46.923 --> 01:21:51.136
Yeah, I mean Hardin
does what Hardin does.

753
01:22:35.138 --> 01:22:36.765
What's wrong?

754
01:22:37.849 --> 01:22:41.186
What's all this about?

755
01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:44.856
What didn't you tell me?

756
01:22:44.981 --> 01:22:46.649
Nothing. I don't know
what she's talking about.

757
01:22:46.775 --> 01:22:48.610
You don't know what
she's talking about?

758
01:22:48.693 --> 01:22:50.403
- I mean, I don't know.
- What didn't you tell me?

759
01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.362
Nothing.

760
01:22:53.448 --> 01:22:54.491
I need to go.

761
01:22:54.574 --> 01:22:57.911
What, now? Hardin, answer me!
Where are you going?

762
01:22:57.994 --> 01:22:59.871
- Out.
- What's going on?

763
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:04.667
Do you trust me?

764
01:23:04.751 --> 01:23:05.794
Of course, I do, I just...

765
01:23:05.877 --> 01:23:07.212
Then what's the problem?

766
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:35.800
What are you doing
in Hardin's car?

767
01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:38.303
What, I can't borrow his car?

768
01:24:40.764 --> 01:24:42.932
Jace, just tell me where he is!

769
01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:48.146
Maybe he's at Blind Bob's.

770
01:25:16.925 --> 01:25:20.845
Oh, my gosh, hey.
What's the matter?

771
01:25:23.848 --> 01:25:25.308
Are you okay?

772
01:25:25.392 --> 01:25:26.976
Yeah.

773
01:25:27.102 --> 01:25:29.813
You want some fries,
are you hungry?

774
01:25:29.938 --> 01:25:33.733
I haven't seen
you since you moved out.

775
01:25:33.817 --> 01:25:38.863
Um, I've been living
with Hardin off-campus.

776
01:25:38.988 --> 01:25:42.659
Wait, you two are
living together?

777
01:25:42.742 --> 01:25:43.910
Yeah.

778
01:25:43.993 --> 01:25:46.538
Wow, Tessa, I didn't know
you two were that serious.

779
01:25:46.663 --> 01:25:48.164
Yeah, we are.

780
01:25:48.289 --> 01:25:50.542
How long has
this been going on for?

781
01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:51.835
Look who I found.

782
01:25:51.918 --> 01:25:53.169
Oh, hey, Jace, hi, Hardin.

783
01:25:53.294 --> 01:25:55.672
- What's up? What's up, Tessa?
- You are very talented.

784
01:25:55.797 --> 01:25:57.716
I got you.

785
01:25:57.841 --> 01:25:59.175
Tessa?

786
01:26:01.177 --> 01:26:03.680
Hi, Hardin.

787
01:26:03.763 --> 01:26:06.349
Tessa was just
telling us the latest.

788
01:26:08.017 --> 01:26:10.979
Tessa's been filling us
in on all the details.

789
01:26:11.062 --> 01:26:12.147
Moving in together?

790
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:15.191
And you guys are so adorable.

791
01:26:15.275 --> 01:26:18.528
Is there anything you
want to tell Tessa?

792
01:26:18.611 --> 01:26:21.197
Yeah, like what's been going
on between you and her?

793
01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:22.699
Nothing's going on
with me and her.

794
01:26:22.782 --> 01:26:24.868
Well, I don't believe you.

795
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:26.202
What have you said?!

796
01:26:26.327 --> 01:26:29.039
- Tessa, I swear...
- I saw the texts that she sent.

797
01:26:29.164 --> 01:26:31.124
What te... they
didn't mean anything.

798
01:26:31.207 --> 01:26:32.500
I didn't even reply to
them, they meant nothing.

799
01:26:32.584 --> 01:26:35.045
- You're kidding me.
- Tessa, nothing's going on.

800
01:26:35.128 --> 01:26:37.338
Don't you think this thing
has gone a little too far?

801
01:26:37.422 --> 01:26:40.216
What thing, Hardin?

802
01:26:40.341 --> 01:26:44.220
Something's going on, but
it's not what you think.

803
01:26:44.304 --> 01:26:46.181
Molly, shut up.

804
01:26:49.059 --> 01:26:53.730
Tessa, let's get out of
here and I'll explain.

805
01:26:53.855 --> 01:26:56.107
I'll explain
everything, I promise.

806
01:26:56.232 --> 01:26:58.026
Remember truth or dare?

807
01:26:59.819 --> 01:27:01.821
What?

808
01:27:01.905 --> 01:27:03.365
Molly, don't.

809
01:27:05.909 --> 01:27:07.369
Molly!

810
01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:11.373
I'm done playing this game.

811
01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:15.210
- Oh!
- I like this girl.

812
01:27:15.293 --> 01:27:20.715
Looks like Hardin Scott
just got his first rejection.

813
01:27:20.799 --> 01:27:22.717
You don't think I
can make it happen?

814
01:27:22.801 --> 01:27:25.053
Make what
happen, Hardin?

815
01:27:25.136 --> 01:27:29.057
Here's a dare: make her
fall in love with me

816
01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.977
and then, I'll just...

817
01:27:35.438 --> 01:27:37.148
turn it off.

818
01:27:44.406 --> 01:27:46.408
It was all a game.

819
01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:53.164
Tessa, Tessa...

820
01:27:53.289 --> 01:27:55.458
Tessa, please you
have to believe me.

821
01:27:57.377 --> 01:27:59.963
Tessa, that was
before everything,

822
01:28:00.046 --> 01:28:03.133
before I got to know you.

823
01:28:08.763 --> 01:28:10.432
Is that true?

824
01:28:19.232 --> 01:28:21.526
And all of you knew?

825
01:28:30.744 --> 01:28:32.454
Tessa.

826
01:29:01.608 --> 01:29:04.360
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

827
01:29:04.444 --> 01:29:07.572
So, what exactly did
you tell them, then?

828
01:29:07.697 --> 01:29:09.074
Nothing.

829
01:29:11.159 --> 01:29:13.036
None of it was real.

830
01:29:14.621 --> 01:29:17.832
I actually thought...

831
01:29:17.916 --> 01:29:19.667
I thought that...

832
01:29:24.714 --> 01:29:27.133
You're just a liar.

833
01:29:27.217 --> 01:29:28.843
That was all before...

834
01:29:28.927 --> 01:29:30.470
Before what?

835
01:29:30.553 --> 01:29:31.971
Before...

836
01:29:32.055 --> 01:29:34.391
You snapped your fingers
and you turned it off.

837
01:29:41.398 --> 01:29:44.526
You said nothing could change
the way you felt about me.

838
01:29:47.946 --> 01:29:50.532
Then, I guess we're both liars.

839
01:31:37.889 --> 01:31:40.141
Hi, Mom.

840
01:31:59.202 --> 01:32:00.537
What happened?

841
01:32:03.331 --> 01:32:06.710
I don't really want
to talk about it.

842
01:32:11.589 --> 01:32:18.722
I just... I came here
to say that I'm sorry.

843
01:32:24.728 --> 01:32:28.857
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

844
01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:33.737
I love you.

845
01:33:06.978 --> 01:33:08.563
So how come you're back?

846
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:13.318
I just needed to come home.

847
01:33:23.536 --> 01:33:25.622
I'm so sorry, Noah.

848
01:33:27.957 --> 01:33:30.335
I never meant to hurt you.

849
01:33:34.798 --> 01:33:36.800
Yeah, I know.

850
01:33:41.429 --> 01:33:46.768
I guess I just never
saw any of this coming.

851
01:33:49.479 --> 01:33:57.654
Yeah, but that's
like the point, right?

852
01:33:57.737 --> 01:34:02.325
We like... we change and
we discover who we are.

853
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:05.286
I think that's okay.

854
01:34:06.746 --> 01:34:08.123
Yeah?

855
01:34:08.206 --> 01:34:09.624
Yeah.

856
01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:30.473
On a parting note,
I was deeply impressed by all

857
01:36:30.557 --> 01:36:33.935
of your papers attacking our
themes for this semester.

858
01:36:34.018 --> 01:36:37.188
Congratulations on
all of your good work.

859
01:36:49.034 --> 01:36:50.744
Miss Young?

860
01:36:54.205 --> 01:36:56.875
This is what Hardin turned in.

861
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.129
I think it was actually written
more for you than it was for me.

862
01:37:08.136 --> 01:37:11.347
Thank you.

863
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:43.838
What is that?

864
01:37:45.715 --> 01:37:51.054
Oh, a secret spot, and
a good place to think.

865
01:38:01.481 --> 01:38:04.359
I've read
hundreds of novels in my life.

866
01:38:04.442 --> 01:38:08.697
Most of them claiming that love
was the center of the universe.

867
01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.741
That it could heal any
damage inside of us.

868
01:38:11.825 --> 01:38:14.244
That it was what
we need to survive.

869
01:38:19.249 --> 01:38:22.919
From Darcy to Heathcliff,
I thought they were fools.

870
01:38:23.044 --> 01:38:25.213
That love was
something fictional

871
01:38:25.296 --> 01:38:29.342
only found in worn
pages of a book.

872
01:38:29.426 --> 01:38:33.430
But that has all changed since
I met my Elizabeth Bennet.

873
01:38:38.101 --> 01:38:40.854
I never thought I would
find myself completely

874
01:38:40.937 --> 01:38:45.108
and utterly consumed
by another until her.

875
01:38:45.233 --> 01:38:49.320
She took my hand and led
me out of the darkness

876
01:38:49.446 --> 01:38:52.282
and showed me that whatever
our souls are made of

877
01:38:54.951 --> 01:38:58.204
hers and mine are the same.

878
01:39:03.126 --> 01:39:08.256
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

879
01:39:10.467 --> 01:39:13.470
You once asked who I
loved most in this world.

880
01:39:23.188 --> 01:39:25.315
It's you.
