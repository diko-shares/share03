I'm telling you,
I'm a big star on Disney+.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:19.894
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't seem to be one of us.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.983
He gets in? He's not even wearing pants.

4
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.860
Welcome, Mr. Goofy.

5
00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:28.445
Do you have a plus-one?

6
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.865
Nope, I can't even add plus one.

7
00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.996
Oh, even Tink has a friend.

8
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:41.958

He's choking. Someone Heimlich him.

I'm not choking. Leave me alone.

Some days you just don't
feel like being goofy, you know?

14

I don't know if you're a cow or a dog,
but you're definitely a downer.

15
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.290
This party stinks.

16
00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.541
Sorry, Grumpy.

17
00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:26.378
I'm Happy. That's how bad this party is.
