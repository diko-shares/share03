<i>The Torrance Tornado smoked
the mile in four minutes 21.3 seconds.</i>

2
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.510
<i>Zamperini is now officially the fastest
high school runner in American history.</i>

3
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.152
<i>This is the Green Hornet.
We're going down.</i>

4
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.993
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday.</i>

5
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.196
Mr. Zamperini, good morning.
Sightseeing today?

6
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880
No.

7
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.360
Shall I call a taxi?

8
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.634
There's no need. I'll walk.

9
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.029
Do you know the way?

10
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.992
It's not my first time
in Tokyo.

11
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.438
Mr. Zamperini?
Robert Trumball.

12
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.216
Thank you for allowing me
to join you today.

13
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.959
I was always a fan
of <i>Time Magazine.</i>

14
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.319
You know, my mother saw you
at the Olympics in '36.

15
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.796
She was thrilled to hear
I'd be meeting with you.

16
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.199
These men did
terrible things to you.

17
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.272
What are you
gonna say to them?

18
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.680
Where's Watanabe?

19
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.709
Where's The Bird?

20
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.311
All right, now,
now can we get out of the car?

21
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.115
Ma, Ma, Ma,
you're gonna kiss me to death.

22
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.440
I can't believe that it's you,
that you're actually home.

23
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.600
He's home, all right.

24
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.592
We were so worried that you would
be all skinny and worn out.

25
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.478
Oh, what, me?
No, I'm in great shape.

26
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.176
Can you believe the army
told us you were dead?

27
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.496
Yeah, so much
for Military Intelligence.

28
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.432
The newspaper said
they hurt you.

29
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.309
Mom, that was just the reporter making
stuff up to try and sell newspapers.

30
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.159
Pop, you knew I was coming home,
didn't you?

31
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560
Yeah, of course.

32
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.280
Of course!
Of course, we all did.

33
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.113
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
Let's go.

35
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.913
Don't step on the grass!

36
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.190
Ah.

37
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.600
You okay?

38
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
Never been better.

39
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.913
- I'll see you inside.
- Yeah.

40
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.473
And thank you, Father,
for bringing our Louie home.

41
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Amen.

42
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.237
Mmm. On the raft,
day after day,

43
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.312
we were talking our heads off,
killing time,

44
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.719
and I was always bragging
about Ma's cooking.

45
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.197
Yeah, and the guys,
they would make me describe

46
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.354
every dish, you know, every sauce,
every pinch of spice, everything,

47
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.000
all the details, over and over
again, every single day.

48
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.680
And you know what
their favorite was, Ma?

49
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.910
What?

50
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.275
Your gnocchi.

51
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.840
What is this, Christmas?

52
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.336
Every Christmas
since you've been gone.

53
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.511
And all your birthdays.

54
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.512
Three years' worth.
Here you go.

55
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.474
What are these? Hmm?

56
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.955
Letters.

57
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.311
2,000 of them.

58
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.232
And why are people
writing me letters?

59
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.896
Well, they wanna know if you're
going to run in the London Olympics.

60
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.256
Yeah,
you are a hero, Louie.

61
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.239
Nah, they got me confused
with some other fellow, Ma.

62
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.356
I don't think so.

63
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.950
Father Cardarelli!

64
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.360
Ah, Louise.

65
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.474
Louie!
Louie, come talk to Father Cardarelli.

66
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.394
Thank you, Mama.

67
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.475
Bless you, Louis.
Welcome home.

68
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960
Thank you, <i>padre.</i>

69
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.032
All of Torrance was praying
for your safe return.

70
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120
Well, that's swell!

71
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.318
It's a miracle you survived.

72
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.240
Miracles didn't save
my tail feathers, <i>padre.</i>

73
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.296
A couple of atomic bombs did that.

74
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.597
No. Don't discount God's role
in your journey.

75
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.036
Don't worry, <i>padre.</i>
I give Him all the blame.

76
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.160
Hey, Ma, they're playing
our favorite song. Come on!

77
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.680
Louis, Louis...

78
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.231
God's not to blame
for your suffering.

79
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.554
Thanks, <i>padre.</i>

80
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.999
Hey! Whoa! No! Play it again!
Play it again.

81
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.077
Louie, I have
a surprise for you.

82
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.274
It's how we found out
you were still alive.

83
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.960
<i>Japanese have
released a recording</i>

84
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.639
<i>of an American prisoner
they claim is</i>

85
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.439
<i>Olympian Louie Zamperini.</i>

86
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.516

and Father,</i>

87

<i>relatives and friends.</i>

88
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.519
<i>This is your Louie talking.</i>

89
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.838
<i>Through the courtesy
of the authorities here,</i>

90
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.799
<i>I am broadcasting
this personal message to you.</i>

91
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.189
Turn it off.

92
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.429
<i>And this will be the first
time in two and a half years</i>

93
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.874
<i>that you will
have heard my voice.</i>

94
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
Turn it off!

95
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.313
<i>I am sure it's...</i>

96
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.193
Dad kept the oil changed
for you.

97
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.200
He drove it around the block
once a week.

98
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320
Yeah.

99
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.353
Well, I didn't think I'd ever
see this old wreck again.

100
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.996
Mmm.

101
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.477
It's a work in progress.
You'll get it tuned up.

102
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.560
Oh, Pete.

103
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.560
Now you are always seeing
the potential in things,

104
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.310
you know,
even your baby brother.

105
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.359
I just made you lay off
those candy bars.

106
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
No. Uh-uh.

107
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.200
No, sir, you turned me
into a running machine.

108
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.719
But I will
tell you this much.

109
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.633
See, when those B-29s,
they came flying over the camp,

110
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.313
they dropped Hershey Bars.

111
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.157
Oh, and I couldn't
help myself.

112
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.960
You ever see what chocolate
does to your guts

113
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.271
after a couple of years
of moldy rice?

114
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.110
It ain't pretty.

115
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.279
You know that Sunday
that Pearl Harbor happened?

116
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.994
I was eating waffles.

117
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.479
I was on my way
to the golf course.

118
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.597
They said that
we were at war,

119
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.713
you know, but it didn't
feel like war, you know?

120
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.120
Not to me.

121
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.680
It wasn't until I was
stationed in San Diego.

122
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.753
One day, this hospital ship
comes steaming in.

123
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.720
They were carrying all these
guys missing legs and arms.

124
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.395
They were all torn up,

125
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.592
blind, burnt.

126
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.831
You know,
that's when the war became real to me.

127
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.753
And now they say
that it's over.

128
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.680
But any second,
I just keep feeling like this

129
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.477
klaxon horn's
gonna go off, and it's,

130
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.918
"Man your battle stations."

131
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.394
Maybe the war's not over
just 'cause they say it is.

132
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.713
Hey. Come on, let's, uh...
Let's head in. It's late.

133
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.634
Yeah, I'll be in soon.

134
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.310
Ah. You can't help but be
a big brother, can you?

135
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.480
It's a life sentence.

136
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240
Don't look at me!

137
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.192
Rise and shine, knucklehead.
Breakfast is ready.

138
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.313
Hey, Louie.
Good to have you home.

139
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.391
Welcome back, Louie.
Looking good.

140
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.629
- Louie!
- Hey!

141
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040
Hey, Louie!

142
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.473
Hey, there. That's Louie.

143
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760
All right.

144
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.311
<i>Who wants a shot on me,
honoring the return</i>

145
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.040
of Torrance's favorite son,

146
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.076
Louie Zamperini?

147
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.833
To Louie. To the hero!

148
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.319
Hey, no thanks, Reggie.
He's good.

149
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.816
Come on, what are you,
what are you, my shadow?

150
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.957
You got some brass
waiting for you back at the house.

151
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.793
- Come on, I'll drive.
- What do they want?

152
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.310
- They're looking for their hero.
- Yeah.

153
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.513
- Sorry, guys. Duty calls.
- To Louie!

154
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.434
Thank you, boys.
Gotta go see the brass.

155
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.629
Sales of war bonds have taken
a big dip since V-J Day.

156
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.394
We need your help
to juice things up.

157
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.553
All you have to do is shake
hands, make a little speech.

158
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.835
Something upbeat.

159
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.560
Well, I've always done most
of my talking with my feet.

160
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.990
That's a
snappy way to put it.

161
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.872
Yeah, I might be able
to use that.

162
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.196
Uh, I'd like to get a few shots
with Captain Zamperini's family.

163
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.079
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Louie Zamperini!</i>

164
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.111
<i>I was proud to represent my country in Berlin</i>

165
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.476
<i>in the 1936 Olympics,</i>

166
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.791
<i>and, well, I sure am proud
to represent my country</i>

167
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.715
here today in Philadelphia.
Now, when the brass asked me to do this,

168
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.430
I... I told them that
I've always done most of my talking with my feet.

169
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.074
<i>Hello, St. Louis.</i>

170
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.032
Those bills, well,
they keep on coming in,

171
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.635
so I'm gonna need you
to keep buying war bonds.

172
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.599
<i>Thank you so much
for having me!</i>

173
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.318
<i>Everyone always asks me
the same question.</i>

174
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.679
They wanna know how do you survive 47
days on a raft in the Pacific Ocean?

175
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.035
You talk about food.

176
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.040
Now, I would describe
to the boys

177
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.318
how my ma would cook
my favorite dishes.

178
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.471
Well, I'd get them drooling.

179
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.909
Mmm. Mmm.

180
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.480
Sorry about that.

181
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.637
Uh, we talked...
We talked about girls.

182
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.600
Um, Rita Hayworth.

183
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.679
How many polka dots
on that swimsuit?

184
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.480
I counted every
single polka dot on that pin-up.

185
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.555
It's 89, 89 polka dots!
I counted every single...

186
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.434
You know, sometimes I wish
I was one of those polka dots.

187
00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.920
He's drunk.

188
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.039
The war might be over,
but, uh...

189
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.736
But the bills
are still coming in,

190
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.912
so just keep buying
those bonds, folks. Thanks.

191
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.400
All right.

192
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.992
"Sometimes, I wish
I was a polka dot."

193
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.470
Yeah.

194
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.475
Sorry about that.

195
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.190
You need a snort before a
speech to calm you down.

196
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.879
I got no trouble with that.

197
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.071
But you've been getting soused in the
club car on the train every night.

198
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.750
What's going on with you?

199
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.956
It's nothing.

200
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.398
It's just hard to get a good night's
sleep on the road. That's all.

201
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.753
When you get home,
I want you to go see my friend, Dr. Bailey.

202
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.510
Right now, I'm giving you three weeks
R and R in Florida, Miami Beach.

203
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.394
Three weeks? Starting when?

204
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.597
Soon as you can get
a taxi to the station.

205
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.671
Get yourself a suntan
and lay off the hooch.

206
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.994
That's an order.

207
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.516
Thank you.

208
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.193
- Hey, there, gorgeous.
- Hello.

209
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.074
Well, I didn't know they
served Italians in this joint?

210
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640
Harry!

211
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.720
- Hey!
- Hey!

212
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.835
Long time no see!

213
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.516
Man, it is so good to see you,
Mr. Tornado himself.

214
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.600
When did you blow in?

215
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.836
Just a couple hours ago.

216
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.960
That is fantastic.

217
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.256
Fantastic.
What are you drinking?

218
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280
Uh, ginger ale.

219
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.176
Ginger ale? What, are you training for,
the next Olympics or something?

220
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.876
- Uh, barkeep! Two Cuba Libres, <i>por favor.</i>
- You got it.

221
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.671
Well, you don't
look worse for wear.

222
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.936
Well, you know what?
I'm alive. That's all that matters.

223
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960
Damn right.

224
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.111
Oh. Oh, wow.

225
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.789
So many dames.
So little time.

226
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.256
Well, they will keep you
on your toes.

227
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.476
Yeah, well, I had one
stepping on my toes last night.

228
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.200
Took this hat-check girl
out for dinner.

229
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.630
You know, steak, lobster,
the whole thing.

230
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.076
Twenty-five bucks later,
she has to use the ladies' room.

231
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200
I haven't seen her since.

232
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.240
Uh, <i>gracias.</i>

233
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.074
Well, drink up, pal.
We got a lot of dolls to meet

234
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.560
and a lot of places to see.

235
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.520
So there I am
at the Hollywood Christmas Parade,

236
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.835
standing outside this store.

237
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.271
This big old cowboy rides up
on this big old horse, and he says,

238
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.238
"Hey, son, do you mind
watching my horse?"

239
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.959
I'm like, "Sure,
I'll watch your horse."

240
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.999
I look at the saddle,
red rhinestones, "Trigger."

241
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.356
It was Roy Rogers!

242
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.719
I was watching
Roy Rogers' horse.

243
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.296
Did I tell you
about the time

244
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.312
I split an ice cream cone
with Lana Turner?

245
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.516
Right down the middle.

246
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.910
I need a little help
over here, pal?

247
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.280
I'm doing all the work
by myself.

248
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880
What are you looking at?

249
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.432
Oh, wow.

250
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.198
Be still my heart.
Good eye, Lou.

251
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.154
We're just... All right.

252
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.352
Good afternoon, ladies.

253
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.035
You wouldn't happen to be
looking for two he-men

254
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.520
to round out your party,
would you?

255
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.716
Sure.

256
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.976
Do you know
where we can find any?

257
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.070
Oh!

258
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.958
Oh, you really know
how to shoot a guy down.

259
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.160
Oh, she got me, Lou.

260
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.630
Tell my mother I love her.

261
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.078
I think your friend
needs medical attention.

262
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.356
Yeah, I'm not a psychiatrist.

263
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.756
Thanks a lot, pal.

264
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.550
How you doing?

265
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.438
You're Louis Zamperini,
aren't you?

266
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.836
Hello.

267
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.838
I read about you in the papers,
saw you in the newsreels.

268
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.718
Well, it's nice to meet you.

269
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.354
Cynthia Applewhite.

270
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.438
"Do you know
how to change a tire?"

271
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.274
I turn around.
It's Lana Turner

272
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.238
sitting on the curb,
eating an ice cream cone.

273
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.136
And I tell her, "I don't know how to change a tire..."

274
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.296
Your friend
is very entertaining.

275
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.640
He sure thinks so.

276
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.512
When I was a kid,
I lived near Torrance.

277
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.236
Are you kidding me?

278
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.736
You still have the scars
from where those runners spiked you?

279
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.080
Yeah, they got me pretty good.

280
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.160
And that?

281
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.509
Uh, Jap did that one.

282
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920
Thank you.

283
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
For what?

284
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.390
For preserving the free world
for silly girls like me.

285
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.797
I think it was worth it.

286
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.711
Um...

287
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.558
- Hey, would you like to...
- Yes.

288
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.351
What took you so long to ask?
You couldn't tell?

289
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.591
I don't know. I...
I guess I'm a little rusty.

290
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.319
Mmm.

291
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.696
Do you always take girls
fishing on the first date?

292
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.360
What, your mother
wouldn't approve?

293
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.392
My mother only likes
fellows I don't.

294
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.474
She wants me to marry
someone rich and predictable.

295
00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.517
You mean like that guy
in the Caddy convertible?

296
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.069
How do you know that?

297
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.597
- I saw you leaving with him.
- Huh.

298
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.154
Quite the fisherman,
aren't you?

299
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.429
Whoa!

300
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.440
- I think I got a submarine.
- Hey! Ho! Hold on. Here we go.

301
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.432
- Just keep your rod tip up.
- Okay.

302
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.199
Let your line play out.
It's all right.

303
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.835
And hold on tight.

304
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.480
You hold on tight,
or I'm gonna end up in Havana.

305
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.709
That was
so much fun.

306
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.315
Yeah. Not bad
for your first time.

307
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.440
My arms feel like lead.

308
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.955
What do you think it was?

309
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.911
That is hard to tell.
Maybe a redfish.

310
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.195
Ooh.

311
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.751
Why do the good ones
always seem to get away?

312
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.673
You know, I've been asking
myself that question for a long time.

313
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.514
<i>A monster created
by a man they called mad...</i>

314
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.315
I just thought that you'd be too
highbrow for <i>House of Dracula.</i>

315
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.720
I love monster films.

316
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.234
I watch them all the time.

317
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.793
You know what I love about coming
to the picture show during the day?

318
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
What?

319
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.880
Makes me feel like I'm
playing hooky from school.

320
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.317
Just a juvenile delinquent
at heart.

321
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.834
You got that right.

322
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.954
<i>Halfway around the world in Tokyo,
another group was tried.</i>

323
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.358
<i>Japan's Pearl Harbor Premier
Hideki Tojo</i>

324
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.679
<i>led a list of 25 defendants accused of war
crimes and atrocities.</i>

325
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.356
<i>After a two-year trial,
he was hanged for his acts.</i>

326
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.272
<i>Brigadier General Harvey
Reynolds...</i>

327
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.198
<i>You thought you were free?</i>

328
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.795
<i>I will never leave you.</i>

329
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.512
<i>...ceremony,
General MacArthur expresses a wish.</i>

330
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.798
<i>Let us pray that
peace be now restored to the world</i>

331
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.236
<i>and that God will preserve...</i>

332
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.193
Louie? Are you okay?

333
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.430
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.830
I'm all right.

335
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.279
I imagine it's hard
to watch some of that.

336
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.071
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

337
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.396
Did you pray while you
were off fighting the war?

338
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280
Oh, no.

339
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.953
No. Begging is
more like it.

340
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.197
Yeah, I didn't pay much
attention in mass.

341
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.319
I pray all the time.

342
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.512
You're a prayer
answered for me.

343
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.036
Well,

344
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.151
you better not just be
something I'm dreaming.

345
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.992
I'm gonna be very ticked off
if I wake up, and you're gone.

346
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.358
Ow!

347
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.956
- What was that for?
- Waking you up.

348
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.520
See? I'm still here.

349
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.715
Yes, you are.

350
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.919
Come on, Tarzan.

351
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.190
Marry me.

352
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.949
What?

353
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.879
In a week I gotta go
back on the road,

354
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.189
pitching war bonds, and...

355
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.038
I'm not leaving here
without you.

356
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.696
Yeah, that sounds more like a
kidnapping than a marriage proposal.

357
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.880
No, you can go
your whole life

358
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.696
without ever meeting the person
you're supposed to be with,

359
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.074
but you're the one!

360
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.074
Look, we are meant to be together.
I'm not letting go.

361
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.515
I'll race you for it.

362
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.279
Beat me to the lifeguard stand,
and I'll marry you.

363
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.433
You know I hold the national high
school record for the mile, right?

364
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.518
Only looks like
about 50 yards,

365
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.320
and I've been outrunning boys
my whole life.

366
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.110
And if I lose?

367
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.035
Then you lose.

368
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040
You ready?

369
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520
Come on!

370
00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.034
- Right here?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.040
On your mark.

372
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.276
Get set.

373
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.440
Go!

374
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.880
You win.

375
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.878
<i>Well, see,
I was the Tornado.</i>

376
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.559
Now I'm just
the Torrance Tortoise.

377
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.736
You're a great runner.

378
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.216
You just need to get back
out on the track.

379
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.638
It means
I'm past my prime.

380
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.629
I guess I should start
taking Italian lessons.

381
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.160
That's our church.

382
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.875
How did you know?

383
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.996
You told me you went to Sunday school here,
remember?

384
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.790
Thank you.

385
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.952
This whole "for better or for worse" thing,
"in sickness and in health,"

386
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040
you mean it?

387
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.274
You sure
you wanna do this?

388
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560
Yeah.

389
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.994
I'm here for you.

390
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.120
Not the officer.

391
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.436
Not the hero.

392
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800
You.

393
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.155
I love you, Louie.

394
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.160
Congratulations!

395
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.674
Take care, love birds!

396
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.155
Whoo!

397
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.958
- Have fun!
- Beautiful!

398
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.077
<i>- Ciao!</i>
- Bye.

399
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.631
I wonder when they're gonna fix
that darn elevator!

400
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.192
- The water won't turn off.
- What?

401
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.676
Oh, here.
You just gotta hunker down on it. Let me.

402
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.759
Okay. Hey, hey. Come here.
Hold that. Hold that.

403
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.510
Here we go. Where is it?

404
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.312
There it is.
I got it. I got it.

405
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.079
What's so funny?

406
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.034
Oh, look at you.

407
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.756
Look at you.

408
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.635
- Come here. Come here.
- Let go of me. I know how to use this.

409
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.396
Ah! Come here!

410
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.835
No, you're not getting away.

411
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.559
Yeah, hi.

412
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.320
You want to kill me?

413
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.280
No, no, no!

414
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.077
She cannot save you.

415
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.439
I will destroy you both.

416
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.360
<i>Mr. Zamperini,
Major Zeigler asked that we meet</i>

417
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.040
because many of our combat veterans
are suffering from exhaustion

418
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.112
and psychoneurosis.

419
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.319
That doesn't sound like something
a shot of penicillin will fix.

420
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.830
No, I'm afraid not.

421
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.594
These men are waking up
screaming, sobbing,

422
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.830
lashing out.

423
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.750
Are you sleeping well?
Are you having any

424
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.479
night sweats or nightmares?

425
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.314
Nothing I can't handle.

426
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.760
Look, Doc,

427
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.440
unless you can help me
find a job,

428
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.635
I just don't think there's
much you can do for me.

429
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.276
What is said in here
is just between you and me.

430
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.070
Your mental health is just as
important as your physical well-being.

431
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.637
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm here to apply for the delivery job.

432
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.030
Thanks.

Lila Johnson.

448
00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.075
I saw you moving in.
Uh, your husband is a pretty famous man.

449
00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.391
Lucky for us, the landlord
recognized Lou.

450
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.200
Everywhere we went, there were
nearly 100 people on the waiting list.

451
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.517
I'm at the end of the hall
if you need anything.

452
00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

453
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.549
And just drop that basket off
anytime, honey.

454
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.194
It looks like you've been running
barefoot on hot coals.

455
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.394
I have to get used to it.

456
00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.111
You know,
I can't get to London with pretty feet.

457
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.034
Are you serious?

458
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.557
I got some old scores
to settle.

459
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440
What's this?

460
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.760
If you're gonna train for London,
you have do it right.

461
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.312
We'll start at 6:30
every morning.

462
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.514
Yes, dear.

463
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.474
"Yes, dear." That's what husbands are supposed to say

464
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.631
when their wives tell them
to do something.

465
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760
"Yes, dear."

466
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.640
Yes, dear.

467
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.880
I thought you said 6:30?

468
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.871
Pete says to just run a
steady pace and not sprint.

469
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.236
Not until your body
gets used to running again.

470
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.754
You talked to Pete
about this?

471
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.671
Of course. I didn't know
where to buy track shoes.

472
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.038
So just go nice and easy

473
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.920
and see if you can make it
all the way around.

474
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.800
On your mark, get set, go!

475
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.955
I said go!

476
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.360
Yes, dear.

477
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.350
Much better!

478
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.033
But don't stop.
Do another lap!

479
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.434
Thank you, Lord.

480
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.870
4:09!

481
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.949
Look out, London!

482
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.157
You know, every time I cross the finish line,
you're mumbling something.

483
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.272
I wasn't mumbling.
I was saying a prayer.

484
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.470
Yeah? Why?

485
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.040
Sure seems
to make a difference.

486
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.356
You're shaving half a second
off your time every day.

487
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.720
It's 'cause I'm getting
in better shape.

488
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.836
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

489
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.391
Come on, I'll jog
a warm-down lap with you.

490
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.320
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

491
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.590
Come here.

492
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320
Hey!

493
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.236
Mmm.

494
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.800
Smelling good, Papa.

495
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.633
Sylvia,
go check on the pie.

496
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.953
Boys! Boys, stop.

497
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.876
Oh. Yes, Mama.

498
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.191
- Don't hurt your brother.
- Yes, of course not, Mama.

499
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.350
Be nice.

500
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.080
So how's the running going?

501
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.280
- She's got me out there every morning.
- Yeah?

502
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.352
I thought you were bad.
She's a taskmaster.

503
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.313
You think you can run
a 4:07 mile again?

504
00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.955
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't. Yeah.

505
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.077
I'm just saying
you're not a kid anymore.

506
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.240
You still think you can compete
at the Olympic level?

507
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.760
Does Lou know?

508
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.871
He's so worried about money,
finding work.

509
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.437
I don't wanna say anything
until I have to.

510
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.594
Hey, con! Lou bet Pete
he could run a 4:07 mile!

511
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Hike!

512
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.714
- Yeah. That was fast.
- Aw, man.

513
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.280
That's Louie Zamperini!

514
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.310
Hey, guys!

515
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.990
Hiya, Louie.

516
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640
Hey, fellows!

517
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.070
What are you doing here?

518
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.152
Just thought I'd put some
miles on this track.

519
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.430
You're going
for a run?

520
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.876
You can't do a 4:07 mile
if you don't run.

521
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.118
Well, can we run
with you?

522
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.512
Suppose if you like looking
at my backside.

523
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.360
I don't know.
I was the league champ in the mile last year.

524
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.035
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the '48 Olympics in London.

525
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.832
I'm not racing
Louie Zamperini.

526
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.273
All right, boys!
On your marks.

527
00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760
Get set.

528
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.555
Go!

529
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.114
4:07!

530
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.515
4:07! He did it!

531
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.556
- Louie!
- Louie!

532
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.552
We'll have another doctor
take a look.

533
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.277
There must be something
that they can do.

534
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.712
Army doc in Tokyo told me,
if I hurt it again, it was all over.

535
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.520
Why didn't you tell me that?

536
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.830
Because it doesn't matter.

537
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.517
Louie, we're supposed
to be open with each other.

538
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.310
You know, when I was a kid,
I fell down some stairs.

539
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.276
You know, I was maybe
six or seven years old,

540
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.591
and I fell,
and I hurt myself.

541
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.275
So I cursed.

542
00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.430
I get up and, son of a gun,
if I didn't fall

543
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960
again.

544
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.830
See, that's three times that I fell,
and I remember thinking to myself...

545
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.880
I thought so clearly
that it was God,

546
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.158
that He was doing this to me,
He was tripping me up.

547
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.756
And I just can't help but think that maybe,
just maybe, He's doing it again.

548
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.958
- Louie.
- No. No.

549
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.320
I was doing
what I was born to do.

550
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.679
I was back on the track.

551
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.674
It's just everything is

552
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.714
whole again.

553
00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.189
I'm just whole again.

554
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.633
And all the terrible things,
they just go away.

555
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.837
It's just my heart pumping,

556
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.640
and my lungs pumping,

557
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.360
and my legs pumping and...

558
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.755
And it's necessary.

559
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.753
I mean, do you see that?

560
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.278
For Him to take it
away, it's, uh...

561
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.994
We pushed too hard.

562
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680
Was that it?

563
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.478
Is this some kind
of punishment?

564
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.616
<i>I was standing there
at the Hollywood Christmas Parade,</i>

565
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.996
<i>and a cowboy comes up to me
on a big horse.</i>

566
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.676
And I kid you not,
it was Roy Rogers.

567
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.951
Oh! There he is!

568
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.839
Ladies and gentlemen,
the late Louie Zamperini!

569
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.676
Sorry we're late.

570
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.913
Phil, come here.

571
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.389
It's great to see you.

572
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.630
It's good to see you, too.

573
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.790
This is my wife, Cecile.

574
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.231
Call me Cecy.
Everyone does.

575
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.595
I've heard
so much about you.

576
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.520
- It's lovely to finally meet you.
- You, too.

577
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.155
- This is my wife, Cynthia.
- Hello.

578
00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.320
- Hi.
- Hi.

579
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.439
Oh, uh, yeah, this is Valerie.

580
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.080
She works
for Universal Pictures.

581
00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.879
I'm just in the typing pool.

582
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.160
Hello.

583
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.954
So what's with the limp?

584
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.760
Oh, it's nothing.

585
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.436
I just, uh, tripped
going down some stairs.

586
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.476
Oh, hey, Phil was telling us
about that crash landing

587
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.438
you guys had in that B-24.

588
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.319
Sounds like a whale
of a tale.

589
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.576
The only reason
I'm still alive is because this guy

590
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.717
was the best pilot
in the Pacific.

591
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.634
- Here's to Harold.
- Yeah.

592
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.520
Who's Harold?

593
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.317
Harold Brooks.
He was one of our waist gunners.

594
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.519
He didn't make it
back alive that day.

595
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.318
Pardon me. I need
to powder my nose.

596
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.520
Would you mind going
with Val just to make sure she comes back?

597
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.839
- What?
- What?

598
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.440
I'll join you two.

599
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.993
Hey. Uh...

600
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.616
Give me another round
and keep them coming.

601
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.640
Yes, sir.

602
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.949
Whoa, slow down, Jack.

603
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.080
I gotta get a little food
in my belly first.

604
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.560
Well, you could have
a bread stick.

605
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.280
Hey, how is it being
back home in Indiana?

606
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.232
Beats Japan.

607
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.836
I read in the paper
they can't find The Bird.

608
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.200
Rounded up all the rest of the guards,
but he flew the coop.

609
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.920
Who?

610
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.915
Jap prison guard.

611
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.193
Mutsuhiro Watanabe.

612
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.755
Called him The Bird.

613
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.240
He was the worst of the worst.

614
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.875
Real nightmare.

615
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.071
Hey, I just read
about this ex-POW,

616
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.320
he was heading to work,
you know, still over there.

617
00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.511
And he saw this Jap face
in the crowd, right?

618
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.790
Well, he gets suspicious,

619
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.794
so he follows him,
and dang if it ain't a guard from his camp!

620
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.190
What did he do?

621
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.360
He blew the whistle on him.

622
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.280
Now he's cooling his heels
in Sugamo Prison!

623
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.878
Prison is too good
for The Bird.

624
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.513
Okay, okay. Okay, so I look up,
and these two love birds, gone,

625
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.638
vanished, poof,
right into thin air.

626
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.837
So, about a week goes by.
I see Mr. Tornado. I say,

627
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.310
"Hey, bud,
where'd you guys go?"

628
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.272
He looks at me,
and you know what he says?

629
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.640
"Fishing."

630
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.776
Yeah, fishing. Can you believe that?

631
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.553
So romantic.

632
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.712
It's the truth, Harry.
We really did go fishing.

633
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.917
Yeah, well, I'm never gonna
believe that one.

634
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.474
Hey, waiter, what...
What is this?

635
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.356
- Sir?
- What is this?

636
00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.832
It's rice, sir.

637
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.195
I didn't order rice.

638
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.795
- It comes with the meal, sir.
- Yeah, but nobody ordered rice.

639
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.240
Listen.

640
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.629
Louie.

641
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.616
- I've had my fill of rice!
- Louie, come on.

642
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.720
Rice with dirt in it

643
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.440
and bugs and maggots!
What the heck is your problem?

644
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.896
- It's all right, Lou.
- No, it's not all right!

645
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.376
- What the heck is your problem?
- Louie. He didn't know.

646
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.400
It was a mistake, pal.

647
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.836
Don't bring stuff
that people didn't order!

648
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.198
The Bird can't
get away with this.

649
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.391
Somebody's gotta
catch The Bird.

650
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.549
Can't get away with it.

651
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.149
Gotta find him.

652
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.636
Find The Bird.

653
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.039
Come on. Get up.

654
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400
Gonna find him.

655
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.113
Oh, Louie.

656
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.150
No! Oh, God! No!

657
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.839
You will obey me!

658
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.111
Please! Please! Please! No!

659
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.633
<i>Gather here
Sunday afternoons and every evening</i>

660
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.270
<i>to hear the word of God preached
in the power of the spirit</i>

661
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.511
<i>by Dr. Billy Graham
to the salvation of thousands.</i>

662
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.159
At least eat some toast.

663
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.640
Not hungry.

664
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.720
I'm gonna call Pete.
He'll know what to do.

665
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.154
Don't. Don't call Pete.

666
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.994
I can't do this
on my own.

667
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.160
Okay.

668
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.319
Last night was, uh...

669
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.319
It was just the booze.

670
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.119
I just need to get a job.

671
00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.792
Come on, no, don't. Come on.
Where are you going?

672
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.280
To borrow Lila's phone.

673
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.192
Look, I don't want you
to call my brother!

674
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.280
- I don't want Pete knowing about it.
- About what?

675
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.536
You had nothing
to hide last night at the restaurant.

676
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.056
You were acting crazy
in front of everyone.

677
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.216
All right, you know what?
I am not crazy.

678
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.310
I had too much to drink.

679
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.880
Louie, let go...

680
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.440
Let go of me!

681
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.154
I'm pregnant.

682
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.875
What?

683
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.838
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm two months pregnant.

684
00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.078
Why didn't you say anything?

685
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.759
Because I'm scared.

686
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.919
Ever since you hurt your ankle,
you're so angry.

687
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.320
If you don't get help somehow,
I don't know what I'm going to do.

688
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.120
I'm sorry.

689
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.632
I need more than sorry, Lou.

690
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.481
Your physical was fine,
and your lab work came back normal.

691
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.794
In terms of helping with your inability
to sleep and your emotional instability,

692
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.233
we've had some results with hypnosis,
electric shock treatment,

693
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.557
and narcosis therapy.

694
00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.150
Narcosis therapy?

695
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.840
We use high doses
of sodium amytal

696
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.991
and other barbiturates
to help you sleep

697
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.430
for 18 to 20 hours a day
for several days.

698
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.196
No, I'm sure that that works
gangbusters for some guys,

699
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.496
but that just makes me want
a double scotch on the rocks.

700
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.274
Everyone needs help
at some point, Lou.

701
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.120
Even heroes.

702
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.240
I'm just a guy who did nothing
more than survive.

703
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.590
There's a lot of people
that would disagree with that.

704
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.991
In the prison camps,

705
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.800
they tried to take your humanity,
and you wouldn't let them.

706
00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.711
And now it's our job
to help you get through this.

707
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.120
I wish you could.

708
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.753
- Hey.
- Hey.

709
00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.876
How'd it go?

710
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.997
Good. Yeah, he said
that I'm not alone.

711
00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.880
Does he wanna see you again?

712
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.913
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
same time next week.

713
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.115
What's in the bag?

714
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.234
Uh...

715
00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.156
Nothing, just got some foot powder,
toothpaste, a little bit of mouthwash.

716
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.470
Got you a Baby Ruth.

717
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.950
Louie?

718
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.835
Thank you.

719
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.834
Whoo!

720
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.797
So what are you hoping for,
a boy or a girl?

721
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.280
What gives?

722
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120
Lou?

723
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.236
Just some trouble
in paradise. Ah.

724
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.311
I've been having
these dreams, you know?

725
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.556
War dreams?

726
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.029
About Watanabe.

727
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.835
A lot?

728
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.150
Too much.

729
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.557
I just thought I'd be able
to forget everything.

730
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.954
You know, when we heard
that your plane went down,

731
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.216
I told Mom... I said,
"If Louie can get his feet on solid ground,

732
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240
"he's gonna be fine.

733
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.240
"You know, we just give him a
scout knife and a toothbrush,

734
00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.040
"he can take care of himself."

735
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520
Come on.

736
00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.395
A moment of pain is worth
a lifetime of glory, remember?

737
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.438
Come on,
once you get that kid...

738
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.536
Once you have that kid, that's gonna be
the only thing inside that brain of yours.

739
00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.234
- All right? All right?
- Is that so?

740
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.436
- Yeah. Is that so?
- Yeah.

741
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.796
- Oh, you think you've got moves.
- Come on.

742
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.513
You know, I got something
in this brain.

743
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.755
Okay.

744
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.232
That's okay. You're okay.

745
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.835
It's Cynthia.

746
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.193
It's to honor
the best part of me.

747
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.356
Okay, yeah. Oh, I know.
All right. That's right.

748
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.176
No, no, it's okay. She just...

749
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.919
I got it. I got it.

750
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:45.429
<i>Like a diamond in the sky</i>

751
00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.555
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

752
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.755
<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

753
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.398
Louie! Oh, Louie,
it's a real honor.

754
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.155
You know, when Harry told me
you were looking for work, I said,

755
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.199
"Lou Zamperini
is just the man we need."

756
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.510
Come on in.

757
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.474
Have a seat.

758
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.158
I was in the stands
at SC in '38

759
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.199
when you set
the NCAA record for the mile.

760
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.216
What was it, four minutes
and eight seconds, right?

761
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.560
Yeah. That's right.

762
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.037
Pleased as punch
to have you in, Lou.

763
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.954
Let's talk butter and milk.

764
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.470
Sure.

765
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.630
I'm retooling.

766
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.360
I'm expanding,
and powdered milk is the future of Quinn's.

767
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.680
But first, why does the Torrance
Tornado wanna be in the dairy business?

768
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.871
You could work anywhere
with that USC degree.

769
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.479
I wish that were the case, Howard,
but I never graduated USC.

770
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.554
You didn't graduate?

771
00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.157
It was part of the price
of going off to war.

772
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640
I see.

773
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.632
I was under the impression
that you had.

774
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.800
See, everyone in corporate
has a college degree.

775
00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720
I could...

776
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.919
Well, how are you making
ends meet?

777
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.710
Um...

778
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.550
When the army thought I was dead,
they cut my mother a check for 10 grand.

779
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.838
She wouldn't cash it,

780
00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.033
and, when I came back alive,
they let me keep it.

781
00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.480
I guess that takes the sting
out of being dead.

782
00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.393
Yeah, I guess it does.

783
00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.077
Okay, well, you know,
thank you for your time.

784
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.910
Yeah.

785
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.750
Good luck, Lou.

786
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.920
Thanks.

787
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.990
I got a five-to-one.

788
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.312
He moves ahead in the home stretch,
I got 100 bucks in my pocket.

789
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.600
On me, Zamp!

790
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.514
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
what happened?

791
01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.353
And I got a filly
in the second race...

792
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.416
<i>From Minneapolis comes,
the young evangelist Billy Graham</i>

793
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.229
<i>and song leader Cliff Barrows,
his wife Billie Barrows,</i>

794
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.076
<i>and Beverly Shea,
the gospel singer who cooperates with</i>

795
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.279
<i>Christ for Greater Los Angeles
in a great revival campaign.</i>

796
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.720
Is he drinking again?

797
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.834
He says he isn't,
but it's a lie.

798
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.510
Just like saying he's out
looking for work every day.

799
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.758
Have you told him
you know the truth?

800
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.678
I don't think
it will make a difference.

801
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.558
God often uses difficulties
in our lives as a way

802
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.552
of preparing us
for our greater purpose.

803
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.631
I can't tell you what to do,
but I do know this.

804
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.396
Lou is worth the fight.

805
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.351
Sometimes, I don't think
I know him at all.

806
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.235
Sweetie, it takes time.

807
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.234
It's like two trees
planted side-by-side.

808
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.750
Over the years, they grow
in and around each other.

809
01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.591
That's why widows like me
look so odd sometimes.

810
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.114
Sorry.
I shouldn't complain.

811
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.270
Oh.

812
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.319
Oh, no, don't. Don't be.

813
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.193
He had his own demons
like Lou.

814
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.717
But we faced them
down together.

815
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.275
Honey, hi, hi. This is a friend of mine.
It's Fred Porter.

816
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.477
And this is, uh...
This is my wife, Cynthia.

817
01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.755
It's nice to meet you.

818
01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.349
Cynthia?

819
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.834
Hey. Where have you been?

820
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320
At church.

821
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.439
<i>Hey.
Where's the checkbook?</i>

822
01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.996
It's in my purse. Why?

823
01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.356
What was that?

824
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.510
Oh, never mind.

825
01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.318
Just give me the checkbook.

826
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.510
What are you doing?

827
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.840
That's what I was
going to ask you.

828
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.216
Don't embarrass me
like this.

829
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.296
Why do you need
the checkbook?

830
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.816
Because I'm going
into business with Fred.

831
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.194
What kind of business?

832
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.232
We're gonna buy surplus
trucks from the army,

833
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.959
sell them
to the Philippines.

834
01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.511
The auction's tomorrow,
so I need to give him a check,

835
01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.240
which he's gonna take to the
bank first thing in the morning.

836
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.160
How much?

837
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.839
Like $3,000.

838
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.034
That's almost all the money that we
have left in your life insurance.

839
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.976
Yeah, well, you gotta spend
money in order to make money.

840
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.976
And we're gonna make
plenty of money off this deal.

841
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.056
But what do you know about selling
trucks in the Philippines?

842
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.436
What do want me to do?
You want me to pump gas?

843
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.016
- What's wrong with that?
- Oh, yeah, I can see that now.

844
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.269
Hi, I'm the Torrance Tornado.

845
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.936
Why don't you come down,
and I'll fill her up?

846
01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.314
Maybe change the oil.

847
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.234
It's a fat chance.
Now just give me the checkbook!

848
01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.915
No.

849
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.632
You don't get to tell me no.

850
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.595
That is my money,

851
01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.479
and I am the one who died for it,
so give me it.

852
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.632
You're drunk!
You're drunk!

853
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.317
You know what? Enough with the Saint
Cynthia of Miami Beach routine.

854
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.056
Now, you did not marry me
because you thought

855
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.117
that I would make a good
gas-pump jockey.

856
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.000
I married you because I
thought you were a good man!

857
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.836
Fantastic.

858
01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.356
We got this?

859
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.274
You're the champ.

860
01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.919
- Yup.
- Doing all right.

861
01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.917
Hollowed-out Bible.
That's where I'll hide it.

862
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.600
Jap customs agent
won't mess with a Bible.

863
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.440
Oh, she called you?

864
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.711
Let's go.
You're coming home with me.

865
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.950
Oh, beat it, will you?

866
01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.040
Well, you're not going back
to the apartment tonight.

867
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.035
Sylvia's staying there.

868
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.715
Sylvia's there?
Well, it's a real family reunion, then.

869
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.840
What are you gonna
do with this? Huh?

870
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.056
What are you gonna
do with this?

871
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.196
It's none of your business.

872
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.216
None of my business?
Is this none of my business, too?

873
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.310
Huh?

874
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.520
Round trip airfare to Tokyo?

875
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.696
What? Are you and your little
.38 planning a trip to Japan?

876
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.756
Maybe we are.

877
01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.630
You're a drunk.

878
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.277
Is this where you met
your new business partner?

879
01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.576
You put up the Gs, and he puts up what,
another round of drinks?

880
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.557
Stay out of it, all right?
I know what I'm doing.

881
01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.196
You haven't known what you're doing
since you walked out of that POW camp.

882
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.758
You need help,
but you're not man enough to accept it.

883
01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.840
I'm not man enough?

884
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.633
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be,
big brother.

885
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.997
You never got caught up in a
sinking plane and almost drowned.

886
01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.709
No, you never had them
hold you down,

887
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.517
stick a needle in your arm and pump you
full of garbage until you almost died,

888
01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.840
and you certainly never had
The Bird punch you in the face

889
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.594
over and over again
until you almost...

890
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.314
No, see, you...

891
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.960
You were on your nice,
clean ship with your nice, clean sheets,

892
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.630
eating your Wheaties.

893
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.231
So thank you
for your service, sailor.

894
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.919
Don't go back
to the apartment tonight.

895
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.275
Mmm-hmm.

896
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.440
Leave Cynthia alone.
She doesn't want you there.

897
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.576
I don't know why they
keep pushing stuff like that.

898
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.557
Look at that.
I mean, it's just...

899
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.432
Do you want to escape?

900
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.718
I asked you a question!

901
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.393
Do you want to escape?

902
01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.793
I wanna go home!

903
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.432
There is no home.

904
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.190
If You save me...

905
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.594
There you go, buddy.
On the house.

906
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.072
Go to hell, Lou.

907
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.720
I do every night!

908
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.314
And what about me? Huh?

909
01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.156
When you come home reeking of whiskey,
or when you don't come home at all?

910
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.549
I'm taking Cissy
and I'm going to Florida.

911
01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.256
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna go home to your parents

912
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.896
and tell them how stupid
you were to marry me?

913
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.230
I can't take care of her
and a drunk at the same time!

914
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.390
So what are you saying?

915
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.034
I'm saying I want a divorce.

916
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.878
It's $499 one-way to Tokyo.
It's only $850 round trip.

917
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.590
<i>- You thought you were free.</i>
- Round trip is the way to go.

918
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.275
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

919
01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.155
Look at me. Look at me.

920
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.400
You are nothing.

921
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680
<i>You...</i>

922
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.600
<i>You thought you were free?</i>

923
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.676
<i>You are nothing.</i>

924
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.274
<i>You are nothing.</i>

925
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.790
<i>You... Don't look at me.</i>

926
01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.680
<i>You are nothing.</i>

927
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.120
Lou?

928
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.513
<i>- You are nothing.</i>
- Lou.

929
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.510
Did I get your attention?

930
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.877
I'm, uh... I'm going out.

931
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.471
Lila asked me
to go to the revival, so...

932
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.276
Hide your wallet.

933
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.234
The circus is in town.

934
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.840
You could come, too.

935
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.635
He's supposed
to be different.

936
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.235
Not like
the old revival shows.

937
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.914
Maybe he could help you.

938
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.320
Look at me. Look at me.

939
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.071
All right, this is why I should bow down
to God, to thank Him for what I am?

940
01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.074
I mean, don't you get it?

941
01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.158
God is my enemy.

942
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880
It's okay.

943
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.279
Lou, I know about the whiskey
bottle in the toilet tank

944
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.154
and the one
under the sink.

945
01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.953
You can't have the life you had before
the war, so you've given up on this one.

946
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.952
On me, on Cissy,
on your family.

947
01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.519
You're not going to Japan.

948
01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.392
You're not gonna
kill The Bird.

949
01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.834
It's a dream.

950
01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.513
It's a sickness.

951
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.839
It's okay. It's okay.

952
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.916
Tonight,

953
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.120
our message is gonna be brief.

954
01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.233
Now, I always say that.

955
01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.431
So I don't want you to get
too hopeful, okay?

956
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.597
<i>This is the Green Hornet.
We're going down.</i>

957
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.797
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday.</i>

958
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.112
There's a lifeline,
and that's the hand of Jesus to hold onto.

959
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.639
I do not believe that any man,
that any man

960
01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:02.511
<i>can solve the problems of life
without Jesus Christ.</i>

961
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.312
<i>There are tremendous
marital problems.</i>

962
01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.192
<i>There are physical problems.
There are financial problems.</i>

963
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320
Help!

964
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.072
<i>There are problems of sin
and habit that cannot be solved</i>

965
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:17.232
<i>without the person
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>

966
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.675
Have you trusted
Christ Jesus as savior?

967
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.200
Tonight,

968
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.070
<i>I'm glad to tell you that the
Lord Jesus can be received,</i>

969
01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.077
<i>your sins forgiven,</i>

970
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.559
your burdens lifted,
your problems solved

971
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.957
by turning your life
over to Him

972
01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.478
<i>and repenting of your sin and
turning to Jesus Christ as savior.</i>

973
01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.200
Louie, wake up.

974
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120
Louie.

975
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.034
Louie.

976
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.159
Louie. Shh.

977
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.360
Cissy's asleep.

978
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.960
I love you.

979
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.635
And I will not divorce you.

980
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.239
You can leave Cissy.

981
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.514
She's staying with Lila.

982
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.110
But you and I
could go together.

983
01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.950
I don't know any other way
to help you, Louie.

984
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.280
Please come with me.
Please.

985
01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.239
Just say, "Yes, dear."

986
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.309
Yes, dear.

987
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:07.191
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

988
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.356
<i>Do thy friends despise,
forsake thee</i>

989
01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:19.431
<i>Take it to the Lord in prayer</i>

990
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:25.717
<i>In His arms,
He'll take and shield thee</i>

991
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.714
<i>Thou wilt find a solace there</i>

992
01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.515
<i>Amen</i>

993
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.235
Good evening.

994
01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.153
Not what you expected?

995
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.709
The eighth chapter of John
will be our reading tonight,

996
01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.519
if you have your Bibles.

997
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.754
And we begin reading.
"Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives.

998
01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.152
"And early in the morning,
he came again into the temple,

999
01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.397
"and all the people came unto him,
and he sat down,

1000
01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.835
"under the cover of darkness."

1001
01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.434
But let me tell you something.

1002
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.990
Darkness does not hide
the eyes of God.

1003
01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.989
God takes down your life from the time
you were born to the time you die.

1004
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.637
And when you stand before God on that
great Judgment Day, you're gonna say,

1005
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.394
"Lord, I'm not such
a bad fellow."

1006
01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.791
And then they're gonna
pull down the screen,

1007
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.589
and they're gonna show the
moving picture of your life,

1008
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.776
and you're gonna hear every thought
that was going through your head,

1009
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.157
of every minute of every day,
and every second of every minute.

1010
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.836
And your own thoughts,
your own deeds, are gonna condemn you

1011
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.718
as you stand before God
on that day.

1012
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.194
And here tonight,
there's a drowning man,

1013
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.399
a drowning woman,

1014
01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.917
a drowning boy,
and a drowning girl,

1015
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.440
all lost on the sea of life,
not knowing which way to turn,

1016
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.275
but just looking. Just looking for
some type of hope for the future.

1017
01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.439
I don't care how dark or how
perplexing your problems might be.

1018
01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.874
It makes no difference.

1019
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.636
Every problem solved,
every sin washed away.

1020
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.358
Just reach out
and take the hand of Jesus.

1021
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.552
I want everyone
to bow their heads

1022
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.357
and close your eyes.

1023
01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.754
I'm sorry.

1024
01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.352
Are you afraid, Lou?

1025
01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.879
He's not gonna hurt you.

1026
01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.677
You're not happy
the way you are.

1027
01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.238
You wanna change.

1028
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.914
You know when he says,
"All heads bowed, all" whatever?

1029
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.080
"Eyes closed."

1030
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.074
Yeah, that.
See, they gotta be.

1031
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.430
You wanna know why?

1032
01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.559
When I was a kid,

1033
01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.677
and I went to those crummy,
lying revivals,

1034
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.274
I kept my eyes open,

1035
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.949
and so I got to see all the pickpockets
who were stealing from the chumps.

1036
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.596
Okay, here's a story.

1037
01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.760
It's set in the future.

1038
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.437
Cissy is 15.

1039
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.760
She has her first boyfriend.

1040
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.191
He's a good-looking kid,
comes from a nice family.

1041
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.151
She brings him home one day
and doesn't tell us.

1042
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.554
They come through the door,

1043
01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.112
and there you are,
too drunk to remember

1044
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.472
that you're supposed to hide in the
bedroom so that nobody sees you.

1045
01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.757
Instead, you start showing him
your notebooks.

1046
01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.272
Naturally, the kid tries
to get away, but you hang on,

1047
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.716
breathing alcohol in his face.

1048
01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.595
And your daughter,
the light of your life,

1049
01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.196
the little baby that you
wouldn't let anybody else touch,

1050
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.832
she is so ashamed of her
father that she wants to die.

1051
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.038
<i>"Why?"
you ask yourself, "Why is God silent</i>

1052
01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.713
"while good men suffer?

1053
01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.519
"Why doesn't He
stop the pestilence?

1054
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.831
"Why doesn't He
stop the wars?

1055
01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.590
"Why doesn't He stop
the suffering in this world?"

1056
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.320
Well, that is the question
that has mystified people

1057
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.836
from generation to generation.

1058
01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:37.472
If you look into the heavens tonight,
on this beautiful California night,

1059
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.640
I can see the stars,

1060
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.959
<i>and I can see
the footprints of God.</i>

1061
01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.314
And I say to myself,
"My Father, my heavenly Father,

1062
01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.352
"He hung them there
with his flaming fingertip."

1063
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.896
- Yes.
- "And he holds them there

1064
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.116
"by the power
of His omnipotent hand."

1065
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.600
Amen.

1066
01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.796
What God asks
of men is faith.

1067
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.119
You can't see Him.
You can't hear Him.

1068
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:03.794
God makes Himself unseen.

1069
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.156
But I believe that God
is still performing miracles.

1070
01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.310
- Yes.
- Amen.

1071
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.471
I believe that God
is still healing bodies.

1072
01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.517
I believe that God
is still healing hearts.

1073
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.639
I believe that God is still
transforming lives.

1074
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760
Amen.

1075
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.480
And He says to each of us,

1076
01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.839
"If you suffer, I'll give you
the grace to go forward."

1077
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.639
But because
you can't hear Him,

1078
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.515
because you can't see Him
in His silent of heaven...

1079
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Amen. Amen, brother!

1080
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.736
...you turn
away from Him.

1081
01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.816
And let me tell you, brother,

1082
01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.056
that's the most
dangerous place to be,

1083
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.639
to sit there day after day

1084
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.360
- and never accept salvation.
- Amen.

1085
01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.195
Hardening your soul day after day,
night after night, until it's too late.

1086
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:41.280
Yes!

1087
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.274
That God cannot even reach
into your heart of hearts

1088
01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.272
and save you from yourself.

1089
01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.760
- Hallelujah.
- Amen!

1090
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.272
I want everyone
to bow their heads.

1091
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.189
Close your eyes.

1092
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.676
Lou.

1093
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.800
Don't leave!

1094
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.479
You can leave
while I'm preaching, but not now.

1095
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.080
If You save me...

1096
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.630
<i>Look at me.</i>

1097
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.875
Look at me.

1098
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.750
No.

1099
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.194
Look at me.

1100
01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.669
Look at me!

1101
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.240
This is it.

1102
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.431
God has spoken to you.

1103
01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.835
It is time. Come on.

1104
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.399
If You save me,

1105
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.871
I will serve You forever.

1106
01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.352
He kept me alive
through everything

1107
01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.270
for this.

1108
01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.199
The war is over.

1109
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.155
Where's Watanabe?

1110
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.515
Where's The Bird?

1111
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.398
We're pretty sure
he's still alive.

1112
01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.197
We will keep looking
for him, Captain.

1113
01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.314
Then do me a favor.

1114
01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.070
If he ever turns up,

1115
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.840
you give him this for me.

1116
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.192
Tell him to take a look at Matthew,
chapter six, verse 14.

1117
01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.517
"For if you forgive other people
when they sin against you,

1118
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.274
"your heavenly Father
will also forgive you."

1119
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:47.680
It's okay.

1120
01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.600
It's okay.

1121
01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.680
It's over.

1122
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.155
It's over.

1123
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.311
It's gonna be okay.
I forgive you.

1124
01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.637
I forgive you. God bless you.
It's okay. Okay?

1125
01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.349
All right.

1126
01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.160
It's okay.

1127
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.560
It's okay.

1128
01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:31.989
I forgive you.

1129
01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.637
God bless you.
God bless you.

1130
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.795
It's all right.
I forgive you.

1131
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520
I forgive you.

1132
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.199
It's okay.
God bless you, sir.

1133
01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.713
<i>During the war,
Louis Zamperini was an American war hero.</i>

1134
01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.270
<i>He was 47 days on a life raft</i>

1135
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.158
<i>floating around
in the Pacific.</i>

1136
01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.511
<i>And he began to drink
when he came home,</i>

1137
01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.480
<i>and he was confused and frustrated
and mixed up in his life.</i>

1138
01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.476
<i>And he, too, wandered into that tent
on Washington and Hill in Los Angeles</i>

1139
01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.233
<i>and found Christ
as his savior.</i>

1140
01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.315
<i>And tonight,
he is the director of the Victory Boys Camp</i>

1141
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.077
<i>forjuvenile delinquents in Los Angeles,
giving his full life now</i>

1142
01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.517
<i>to try to rehabilitate
juvenile delinquents</i>

1143
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.070
<i>and lead them to a knowledge
of Jesus Christ.</i>

1144
01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.675
<i>Louis, we're delighted
to have you with us tonight.</i>

1145
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.960
<i>Thank you, Billy.</i>

1146
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.671
<i>It was after the war and with
about $10,000 in back pay</i>

1147
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.592
<i>from two and a half years
in prison camp</i>

1148
01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.596
<i>and also collecting my life
insurance for being dead.</i>

1149
01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.676
<i>I became extremely selfish,
cynical, and greedy</i>

1150
01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.829
<i>until the wind was finally
let out of my sails.</i>

1151
01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.713
<i>I lost everything that I possessed
outside of my wife and little girl,</i>

1152
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.190
<i>and it was then that my wife
was able to persuade me</i>

1153
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.110
<i>into going down
to that meeting.</i>

1154
01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.240
<i>I asked the Lord Jesus Christ to
come into my heart and save me,</i>

1155
01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.918
<i>and, of course, he did.</i>

1156
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.271
<i>These are kids
that quit high school.</i>

1157
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.397
<i>They haven't
accomplished anything.</i>

1158
01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.880
<i>So I have a chart,</i>

1159
01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.750
and all during the week they
gotta pass everything, boating...

1160
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.957
And I get them up
on the top of the mountain

1161
01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.596
and teach them
glacier survival and rescue.

1162
01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.240
So that at the end of the week,
I show the kids,

1163
01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.234
"Look at the things you've accomplished
all week. They weren't easy.

1164
01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.995
"It shows that you can
accomplish anything you want.

1165
01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.830
"Now, you go back
and finish your time,

1166
01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.839
"and then go back and get
your high school diploma,

1167
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.834
"and that's the first big
accomplishment of your life."

1168
01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:09.634
While I was still on my knees,
my life changed in a matter of moments

1169
01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:12.269
because I knew I was
through getting drunk,

1170
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.830
and I knew that
I forgave my guards,

1171
01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.358
and I knew it was a miracle because
I forgave The Bird.

1172
01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.320
And that was
the first night...

1173
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.278
The first night in two and a half
years I didn't have a nightmare,

1174
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.439
and I haven't
had one since.

1175
01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.237
Forgiveness must
be complete,

1176
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.877
no matter
who the person is.

1177
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.078
And I've had a few enemies,
even the last few years,

1178
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.392
and the only way I can forgive
them is to pray for them,

1179
01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.520
and that's what I do.
Instead of hating them, I pray for them.

1180
01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.831
<i>You just have to buckle up
and go on to greater things.</i>

1181
01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:54.156
<i>The guy says, "Aren't you the guy
that spent 47 days on a raft?"</i>

1182
01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.310
<i>I said, "Yeah."</i>

1183
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.560
<i>He said, "You're entitled
to travel pay."</i>

1184
01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.633
<i>I said,
"What?" He said...</i>

1185
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.912
<i>That's a very efficient guy.</i>

1186
01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:10.158
<i>He said,
"$7. 60 a day times 47."</i>

1187
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.994
<i>He made out a bill,
mailed it to Washington,</i>

1188
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.916
<i>and a week later,
we got a response.</i>

1189
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.997
<i>And it said,
"Request denied.</i>

1190
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.549
<i>"Reason,
travel unauthorized."</i>
