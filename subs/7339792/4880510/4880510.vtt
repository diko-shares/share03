00:34:19.085 --> 00:34:21.120
Oh, my goodness.

481
00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:23.221
Oh. <font color="#FFD700">(chuckles)</font>

482
00:34:23.223 --> 00:34:25.156
I wish they'd
fix that elevator.

483
00:34:25.158 --> 00:34:27.859
I don't trust it
even when it does work.

484
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:30.228
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

485
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.230
I'm Cynthia Zamperini.

486
00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:35.701
Lila Johnson.
I-I saw you movin' in.

487
00:34:35.703 --> 00:34:39.170
Uh, your husband
is a pretty famous man.

488
00:34:39.172 --> 00:34:41.306
Lucky for us the landlord
recognized Lou.

489
00:34:41.308 --> 00:34:45.247
Everywhere we went, there were nearly
a hundred people on the waiting list.

490
00:34:47.582 --> 00:34:49.681
I'm at the end of the hall
if you need anything.

491
00:34:49.683 --> 00:34:50.949
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

492
00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:54.122
And just drop that basket
off anytime, honey.

493
00:34:56.723 --> 00:34:59.891
It looks like you've been
running barefoot on hot coals.

494
00:34:59.893 --> 00:35:01.826
I have to get used to it.

495
00:35:01.828 --> 00:35:05.263
You know, I can't get to
London with pretty feet.

496
00:35:05.265 --> 00:35:07.600
Are you serious?

497
00:35:07.602 --> 00:35:10.002
I got some old scores
to settle.

498
00:35:10.004 --> 00:35:11.706
<font color="#FFD700">(laughing)</font>

499
00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:34.627
What's this?

500
00:35:34.629 --> 00:35:37.096
If you're gonna train for London,
you have to do it right.

501
00:35:37.098 --> 00:35:38.967
We'll start at 6:30
every morning.

502
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:47.306
Yes, dear.

503
00:35:47.308 --> 00:35:49.208
- <font color="#FFD700">(chuckles)</font>
- "Yes, dear."

504
00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:50.875
That's what husbands
are supposed to say

505
00:35:50.877 --> 00:35:53.045
when their wives
tell them to do something.

506
00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:55.350
- "Yes, dear."
- Yes, dear.

507
00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:02.888
I thought you said 6:30.

508
00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.391
<font color="#FFD700">(chuckles)</font>

509
00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:07.792
Pete says to just run a
steady pace and not sprint,

510
00:36:07.794 --> 00:36:10.228
not until your body
gets used to running again.

511
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.931
- Oh, you talked to Pete about this?
- Of course.

512
00:36:12.933 --> 00:36:15.067
I didn't know where
to buy track shoes.

513
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:18.806
So, just go nice and easy and see if
you can make it all the way around.

514
00:36:20.073 --> 00:36:22.676
On your mark, get set, go!

515
00:36:24.178 --> 00:36:25.779
I said go.

516
00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.682
Yes, dear.

517
00:36:38.024 --> 00:36:39.757
Much better!

518
00:36:39.759 --> 00:36:42.696
But don't stop.
Do another lap.

524
00:36:57.745 --> 00:37:00.978
You know, as I-I cross the finish
line, you're mumbling something.

525
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.116
I wasn't mumbling.
I was saying a prayer.

526
00:37:04.118 --> 00:37:06.918
- Yeah? Why?
- Sure seems to make a difference.

527
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.257
You're shaving half a second
off your time every day.

528
00:37:12.026 --> 00:37:14.792
- Just 'cause I'm getting into better shape.
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

529
00:37:14.794 --> 00:37:17.929
Come on, I'll jog
a warm-down lap with you.

530
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:19.033
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

531
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:22.100
Come here.

00:37:22.102 --> 00:37:24.402

00:37:46.893 --> 00:37:49.127
- Don't hurt your brother.
- Yes, of course not, Mama.

540
00:37:49.129 --> 00:37:50.765
Be nice.

541
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:57.770
So, how's
the running going?

542
00:37:57.772 --> 00:37:59.438
- She's got me out there every morning.
- Yeah?

543
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.306
I thought you were bad.
She's a taskmaster.

544
00:38:02.308 --> 00:38:04.044
You think you can run
a 4:07 mile again?

545
00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:07.913
I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't.

546
00:38:07.915 --> 00:38:10.081
Yeah, I'm just saying
you're not a kid anymore.

547
00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:13.455
You still think you can
compete at the Olympic level?

548
00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:24.098
Does Lou know?

549
00:38:32.473 --> 00:38:35.808
He's so worried
about money, finding work.

550
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.277
I don't wanna say anything
until I have to.

551
00:38:38.279 --> 00:38:42.917
Hey, come on. Lou bet Pete
he could run a 4:07 mile.

552
00:38:45.953 --> 00:38:47.388
Hike!

553
00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:53.826
Yeah. That's fast.

554
00:38:53.828 --> 00:38:56.030
- Aw, man.
- That's Louie Zamperini!

555
00:38:57.096 --> 00:38:59.033
Hey, guys!

556
00:39:01.201 --> 00:39:03.502
Hiya, Louie!

557
00:39:03.504 --> 00:39:06.071
- Hey, fellas.
- What are you doin' here?

558
00:39:06.073 --> 00:39:08.239
I just thought I'd put
some miles on this track.

559
00:39:08.241 --> 00:39:12.176
- You goin' for a run?
- You can't do a 4:07 mile if you don't run.

560
00:39:12.178 --> 00:39:14.413
Well, can we
run with you?

561
00:39:14.415 --> 00:39:16.915
Suppose if you like
lookin' at my backside.

562
00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:19.317
I don't know. I was the league
champ in the mile last year.

563
00:39:19.319 --> 00:39:22.554
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the '48 Olympics in London.

564
00:39:22.556 --> 00:39:24.526

Louis Zamperini.

take a look.

There must be something
that they can do.

578
00:41:08.294 --> 00:41:12.099
Army doc in Tokyo told me if I
hurt it again, it was all over.

579
00:41:12.966 --> 00:41:15.035
Why didn't you
tell me that?

580
00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:18.538
'Cause it doesn't matter.

581
00:41:21.174 --> 00:41:24.044
Louie, we're supposed
to be open with each other.

582
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.549
You know, when I was a kid,
I fell down some stairs.

583
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:33.085
I was maybe six
or seven years old,

584
00:41:33.087 --> 00:41:35.386
and I fell
and I-I hurt myself.

585
00:41:35.388 --> 00:41:37.656
So I cursed.

586
00:41:37.658 --> 00:41:41.194
I'd get up, and son of a gun
if I didn't fall...

587
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.665
again.

588
00:41:48.102 --> 00:41:50.469
See, that's three times
that I fell,

589
00:41:50.471 --> 00:41:52.437
and I remember
thinking to myself...

590
00:41:52.439 --> 00:41:55.343
I thought so clearly
that it was God.

591
00:41:58.044 --> 00:42:00.277
That he was doing this to me.

592
00:42:00.279 --> 00:42:03.114
He was tripping me up. And I just
can't help but think that maybe,

593
00:42:03.116 --> 00:42:05.283
just maybe
he's doing it again.

594
00:42:05.285 --> 00:42:06.687
- Louie...
- No. No.

595
00:42:07.654 --> 00:42:10.123
I was doing
what I was born to do.

596
00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:13.190
I was back on the track.

597
00:42:13.192 --> 00:42:17.661
It's just everything
is... whole again.

598
00:42:17.663 --> 00:42:20.567
It's...
I'm just whole again.

599
00:42:22.536 --> 00:42:25.737
You know, all the things, the
terrible things, they just go away.

600
00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:30.574
It's just my heart pumping,
and my... my lungs pumping,

601
00:42:30.576 --> 00:42:33.147
and my legs pumping.

602
00:42:38.352 --> 00:42:40.187
And it's necessary.

603
00:42:42.723 --> 00:42:44.592
I mean, do you see that?

604
00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:47.728
Mm-hmm.

605

Tryin' to take it away,
it's...

606
00:43:01.442 --> 00:43:03.411
We pushed too hard.

607
00:43:05.478 --> 00:43:07.281
Was that it?

608
00:43:11.484 --> 00:43:13.387

of punishment?

The only reason
I'm still alive

630
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:47.578
is because this guy was
the best pilot in the Pacific.

of our waist gunners.

He didn't make it back

Whoa, slow down, Jack. I gotta get
a little food in my belly first.

642
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:32.489
Well, you could have
a breadstick.

643
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:34.859
Hey, how's it bein'
back home in Indiana?

644
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:37.362
Beats Japan.

645
00:45:37.364 --> 00:45:40.397
I read in the paper
they can't find The Bird.

646
00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:43.768
Rounded up all the rest of the
guards, but he flew the coop.

647
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.773
Who?

648
00:45:47.373 --> 00:45:51.976
Jap prison guard.
Matsuhiro Watanabe.

649
00:45:51.978 --> 00:45:54.679
Called him The Bird.

650
00:45:54.681 --> 00:45:56.947
He was the worst
of the worst.

651
00:45:56.949 --> 00:45:58.553

read about this ex-POW,

653
00:46:02.022 --> 00:46:04.288
he was headin' to work,
you know, still over there.

654
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.391
And he saw this Jap face
in the crowd.

655
00:46:06.393 --> 00:46:09.527
Well, he gets suspicious,
so he follows him,

656
00:46:09.529 --> 00:46:11.929
and dang if it ain't
a guard from his camp.

657
00:46:11.931 --> 00:46:15.266
- What'd he do?
- Blew the whistle on him.

658
00:46:15.268 --> 00:46:17.971
Now he's coolin' his heels
in Sugamo Prison.

659
00:46:19.906 --> 00:46:21.942

So, about a week goes by,
I see Mr. Tornado.

I say, "Hey, bud.
Where'd you guys go?"

665
00:46:38.292 --> 00:46:40.592
He looks at me,
and you know what he says?

"Fishing."
Yeah, fishing.

667

Oh, Louie.

809
00:58:08.281 --> 00:58:09.380
It's a real honor.

810
00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:11.982
You know, when Harry told me
you were looking for work,

811
00:58:11.984 --> 00:58:15.252
I said, "Lou Zamperini is
just the man we need."

812
00:58:15.254 --> 00:58:16.589
Come on in.

813
00:58:18.123 --> 00:58:19.660
Have a seat.

814
00:58:21.527 --> 00:58:25.129
I was in the stands
at SC in '38

815
00:58:25.131 --> 00:58:28.431
when you set the NCAA record
for the mile.

816
00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:31.469
- What was it, four minutes and eight seconds, right?
- Yeah. That's right.

817
00:58:31.471 --> 00:58:34.007
Pleased as punch
to have you in, Lou.

818
00:58:35.408 --> 00:58:37.143
Let's talk buttermilk.

819
00:58:38.243 --> 00:58:39.342
Sure.

820
00:58:39.344 --> 00:58:40.745
I'm retooling.

821
00:58:40.747 --> 00:58:43.647
I'm expanding, and powdered
milk is the future of Quinn's.

822
00:58:43.649 --> 00:58:48.051
But first, why does the Torrance Tornado
wanna be in the dairy business?

823
00:58:48.053 --> 00:58:50.587
I... You could work anywhere
with that USC degree.

824
00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:54.593
I wish that were the case, Howard,
but I never graduated USC.

825
00:58:56.228 --> 00:58:57.161
You didn't graduate?

826
00:58:57.163 --> 00:59:00.163
It was part of the price
of goin' off to war.

827
00:59:00.165 --> 00:59:02.600
I see.

828
00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:05.168
I was under the impression
that you had.

829
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.538
See, everyone in corporate
has a college degree.

830
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.174
I could... Well, um,

831
00:59:11.176 --> 00:59:12.712
how are you
makin' ends meet?

832
00:59:16.649 --> 00:59:20.618
Um, when the army thought
I was dead,

833
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.622
they cut my mother a check
for ten grand.

834
00:59:23.756 --> 00:59:25.723
She wouldn't cash it.

835
00:59:25.725 --> 00:59:29.192
And when I came back alive,
they let me keep it.

836
00:59:29.194 --> 00:59:31.163
I guess that takes the sting
out of bein' dead.

837
00:59:32.565 --> 00:59:34.368
Yeah, I guess it does.

838
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:40.071
Okay, well, you know,
thank you for your time.

839
00:59:40.073 --> 00:59:41.674
Yeah.

840
00:59:44.477 --> 00:59:45.542
Good luck, Lou.

841
00:59:45.544 --> 00:59:47.079
Thanks.

846
00:59:59.859 --> 01:00:01.558

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.194

855
01:00:25.817 --> 01:00:28.719
Have you told him
you know the truth?

856
01:00:28.721 --> 01:00:30.587
I don't think
it will make a difference.

857
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:33.491
God often uses difficulties
in our lives

858
01:00:33.493 --> 01:00:37.127
as a way of preparing us
for our greater purpose.

859
01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:40.531
I can't tell you what to do,
but I do know this.

860
01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:43.270
Lou is worth the fight.

861
01:00:46.873 --> 01:00:49.672
Sometimes I don't think
I know him at all.

862
01:00:49.674 --> 01:00:52.308
Oh, sweetie,
it takes time.

863
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.312
It's like two trees planted
side-by-side.

864
01:00:55.314 --> 01:00:58.214
Over the years they grow
in and around each other.

865
01:00:58.216 --> 01:01:02.453
That's why widows like me
look so odd sometimes.

866
01:01:02.455 --> 01:01:04.420
Sorry.
I shouldn't complain.

867
01:01:04.422 --> 01:01:06.426
Oh.
Oh, no, don't.

868
01:01:07.627 --> 01:01:10.560
Don't be. He had his
own demons like Lou.

869
01:01:10.562 --> 01:01:12.431
But we faced them
down together.

870
01:01:23.442 --> 01:01:26.277
Honey, hi, hi. This is a friend of mine.
It's Fred Porter.

871
01:01:26.279 --> 01:01:28.545
And this is, uh...
this is my wife, Cynthia.

872
01:01:28.547 --> 01:01:30.449
It's nice to meet ya.

873
01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:40.357
Cynthia?

874
01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:41.895
Hey, where ya been?

875
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.772
At church.

876
01:01:55.607 --> 01:01:57.241
<i>Hey, where's the checkbook?</i>

877
01:01:57.243 --> 01:01:59.779
It's in my purse.
Why?

878
01:02:06.352 --> 01:02:07.417
What was that?

879
01:02:07.419 --> 01:02:09.286
Oh, never mind.

880
01:02:09.288 --> 01:02:10.621
Just...

881
01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:13.257
Just give me the checkbook.

882
01:02:13.259 --> 01:02:14.327
God.

883
01:02:15.962 --> 01:02:17.330
What are you doin'?

884
01:02:18.397 --> 01:02:20.433
That's what I was
going to ask you.

885
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.004
- Don't embarrass me like this.
- Why do you need the checkbook?

886
01:02:27.006 --> 01:02:28.772
Because I'm going into
business with Fred.

887
01:02:28.774 --> 01:02:30.239
What kind of business?

888
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:34.377
We're gonna buy surplus trucks from the
army, sell 'em to the Philippines.

889
01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:37.580
The auction's tomorrow,
so I need to give him a check,

890
01:02:37.582 --> 01:02:40.884
which he's gonna take to the
bank first thing in the morning.

891
01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.786
How much?

892
01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:44.257
It's like 3,000.

893
01:02:46.391 --> 01:02:48.993
That's almost all the money that we
have left in your life insurance.

894
01:02:48.995 --> 01:02:51.261
Yeah, you gotta spend money
in order to make money.

895
01:02:51.263 --> 01:02:52.730
We're gonna make plenty
of money off this deal.

896
01:02:52.732 --> 01:02:55.266
But what do you know about selling
trucks in the Philippines?

897
01:02:55.268 --> 01:02:57.268
What do want me to do?
You want me to pump gas?

898
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.502
What's wrong with that?

899
01:02:58.504 --> 01:03:01.505
Oh, yeah, I can see that now.
Hi, I'm the Torrance Tornado.

900
01:03:01.507 --> 01:03:04.475
Why don't you come down and I'll
fill her up? Maybe change the oil.

901
01:03:04.477 --> 01:03:07.277
It's a fat chance.
Now just give me the checkbook!

902
01:03:07.279 --> 01:03:09.281
No.

903
01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:12.650
You don't get to
tell me no.

904
01:03:12.652 --> 01:03:17.321
That is my money, and I am the one
who died for it, so give me it.

905
01:03:17.323 --> 01:03:19.690
You're drunk!

908
01:03:25.031 --> 01:03:28.969
Now, you did not marry me because you thought
that I would make a good gas pump jockey.

909
01:03:30.303 --> 01:03:32.839
I married you because I thought
you were a good man!

Oh, she called you?

01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:34.764
Let's go.
You're comin' home with me.

Oh, beat it, will ya?

Well, you're not goin' back
to the apartment tonight.

925
01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:42.373
Sylvia's staying there.

926
01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.944
Is that... Well, it's a real
family reunion then.

927
01:04:49.013 --> 01:04:50.848
What are you gonna do
with this? Huh?

928
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:53.150
- What are you gonna do with this?
- It's none of your business.

929
01:04:53.152 --> 01:04:56.152
None of my business? Is this
none of my business too? Huh?

930
01:04:56.154 --> 01:04:57.520
Round-trip airfare
to Tokyo? What?

931
01:04:57.522 --> 01:05:01.460
- Are you and your little .38 plannin' a trip to Japan?
- Maybe we are.

932
01:05:05.698 --> 01:05:07.130
You're a drunk.

933
01:05:07.132 --> 01:05:08.931
Is this where you met
your new business partner?

934
01:05:08.933 --> 01:05:11.634
You put up the G's and he puts up
what, another round of drinks?

935
01:05:11.636 --> 01:05:13.670
Stay out of it, all right?
I know what I'm doing.

936
01:05:13.672 --> 01:05:16.940
You haven't known what you're doing
since you walked out of that POW camp.

937
01:05:16.942 --> 01:05:20.810
You need help, but you're not
man enough to accept it.

938
01:05:20.812 --> 01:05:22.715
I'm not man enough?

939
01:05:24.516 --> 01:05:27.419
I'm more of a man than
you'll ever be, big brother.

940
01:05:28.888 --> 01:05:32.989
You never got caught up in a
sinking plane and almost drowned.

941
01:05:32.991 --> 01:05:35.692
No, you never had them
hold you down,

942
01:05:35.694 --> 01:05:39.196
stick a needle in your arm and pump you
full of garbage until you almost died,

943
01:05:39.198 --> 01:05:42.966
and you certainly never had The Bird punch
you in the face over and over again

944
01:05:42.968 --> 01:05:44.437
until you almost...

945
01:05:45.837 --> 01:05:47.103
Now, see, you?

946
01:05:47.105 --> 01:05:48.571
You were on your nice,

Don't go back to

01:08:31.603 --> 01:08:33.202
When you come home
reeking of whiskey!

974
01:08:33.204 --> 01:08:35.839
Or when you don't even
come home at all?

975
01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:38.608
I'm taking Cissy,
and I'm going to Florida.

976
01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:40.376
What're you gonna do? You're
gonna go home to your parents?

977
01:08:40.378 --> 01:08:41.912
And tell them how stupid
you were to marry me?

978
01:08:41.914 --> 01:08:46.285
- I can't take care of her and a drunk at the same time.
- So, what're you saying?

979
01:08:50.155 --> 01:08:52.725
I'm saying I want a divorce.

980
01:09:02.368 --> 01:09:04.768

one way to Tokyo.

981

The eighth chapter of John will be our
reading tonight, if you have your Bibles.

1077

And we begin reading.

1078
01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.168
Jesus went unto
the Mount of Olives.

1079
01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:02.171
And early in the morning
he came again into the temple

1080
01:18:02.173 --> 01:18:03.739
and all the people came to him,

1081
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:05.742
and he sat down under
the cover of darkness.

1082
01:18:05.744 --> 01:18:07.644
But let me tell you something.

1083
01:18:07.646 --> 01:18:09.845
Darkness does not hide
the eyes of God.

1084
01:18:09.847 --> 01:18:13.715
God takes down your life from the time
you were born to the time you die.

1085
01:18:13.717 --> 01:18:17.287
And when you stand before God
on that great judgment day,

1086
01:18:17.289 --> 01:18:20.355
you're gonna say, "Lord,
I'm not such a bad fellow."

1087
01:18:20.357 --> 01:18:22.958
Then they're gonna
pull down the screen

1088
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.761
and they're gonna show
the moving picture of your life,

1089
01:18:25.763 --> 01:18:28.665
and you're gonna hear every thought
that was goin' through your head

1090
01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:31.870
of every minute of every day, and
every second of every minute.

1091
01:18:32.971 --> 01:18:35.470
And your own thoughts,
your own deeds,

1092
01:18:35.472 --> 01:18:39.474
are gonna condemn you as you
stand before God on that day.

1093
01:18:39.476 --> 01:18:41.610
And here tonight,

1094
01:18:41.612 --> 01:18:43.613
there's a drowning man,

1095
01:18:43.615 --> 01:18:47.750
a drowning woman, a drowning
boy, and a drowning girl,

1096
01:18:47.752 --> 01:18:50.286
all lost on the sea
of life,

1097
01:18:50.288 --> 01:18:52.354

to turn, but just looking...

1098
01:18:52.356 --> 01:18:54.759
just looking for some
type of hope for the future.

1099

perplexing your problems might be.

1100
01:19:01.499 --> 01:19:02.965

1113

Now, you wanna know why?

1117
01:20:49.774 --> 01:20:51.877
You know, when I was a kid...

1118
01:20:53.078 --> 01:20:56.746
and I went to those crummy,
lying revivals?

1119
01:20:56.748 --> 01:20:58.017
I kept my eyes open...

1120
01:21:00.017 --> 01:21:04.922
and so I got to see all the pickpockets
who were stealing from the chumps.

1121
01:21:11.529 --> 01:21:13.365
Okay, here's a story.

1122
01:21:14.632 --> 01:21:16.498
It's set in the future.

1123
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.033
Cissy is 15.

1124
01:21:18.035 --> 01:21:22.975
She has her first boyfriend. He's a
good-lookin' kid, comes from a nice family.

1125
01:21:25.075 --> 01:21:28.043
She brings him home one day
and doesn't tell us.

1126
01:21:28.045 --> 01:21:31.781
They come through the door
and there you are,

1127
01:21:31.783 --> 01:21:34.716
too drunk to remember that you're
supposed to hide in the bedroom

1128
01:21:34.718 --> 01:21:36.587
so that nobody sees you.

1129
01:21:39.457 --> 01:21:42.591
Instead, you start showing him
your notebooks.

1130
01:21:42.593 --> 01:21:44.527
Naturally,
the kid tries to get away,

1131
01:21:44.529 --> 01:21:48.933
but you hang on breathing
alcohol in his face.

1132
01:21:50.668 --> 01:21:55.571
And your daughter,
the light of your life,

1133
01:21:55.573 --> 01:21:59.410
the little baby that you wouldn't
let anybody else touch...

01:22:19.631 --> 01:22:21.564
Why doesn't he stop
the pestilence?

1138
01:22:21.566 --> 01:22:24.000
Why doesn't he stop
the wars?

1139

Why doesn't he stop
the suffering in this world?

1140
01:22:27.872 --> 01:22:32.641
Well, that is the question that has mystified
people from generation to generation.

1141

is faith.

You can't see him,
you can't hear him.

1151
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.805
God makes himself unseen.

1152
01:23:03.807 --> 01:23:06.141

the grace to go forward."

you can't hear him,

the most dangerous place to be,

to sit there day after day,
and never accept salvation.

- Hardening your soul day after day, night after night,

- Yes.

During the war, Louis Zamperini
was an American war hero.

1222
01:32:43.587 --> 01:32:48.290
He was 47 days on a life raft
floating around in the Pacific.

1223
01:32:48.292 --> 01:32:50.425
And he began to drink
when he came home,

1224
01:32:50.427 --> 01:32:54.595
and he was confused and frustrated
and mixed up in his life.

1225
01:32:54.597 --> 01:32:57.065
And he, too,
wandered into that tent

1226
01:32:57.067 --> 01:32:59.501
on Washington and Hill
in Los Angeles

1227
01:32:59.503 --> 01:33:01.437
and found Christ
as his savior.

1228
01:33:01.439 --> 01:33:03.705
And tonight
he is the director

1229
01:33:03.707 --> 01:33:08.743
of the Victory Boys Camp for
juvenile delinquents in Los Angeles,

1230
01:33:08.745 --> 01:33:14.416
giving his full life now to try to
rehabilitate juvenile delinquents

1231
01:33:14.418 --> 01:33:17.219
and lead them to a knowledge
of Jesus Christ.

have you with us tonight.

Thank you, Billy.

1234
01:33:21.859 --> 01:33:25.760
It was after the war and with
about $10,000 in back pay

1235
01:33:25.762 --> 01:33:27.863
from two and a half years
in prison camp

1236
01:33:27.865 --> 01:33:32.667
and also, uh, collecting my
life insurance for being dead,

1237
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:37.805
I became extremely selfish,
cynical, and greedy

1238
01:33:37.807 --> 01:33:42.478
until the, uh, wind was finally
let out of my sails.

1239
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.416
I lost everything that I possessed
outside of my wife and little girl,

1240
01:33:47.418 --> 01:33:51.687
and it was then that my wife
was able to persuade me

1241
01:33:51.689 --> 01:33:54.422
into going down
to that meeting.

1242
01:33:54.424 --> 01:33:58.128
I asked the Lord Jesus Christ to
come into my heart and save me.

1243
01:33:58.896 --> 01:34:01.232

1269
01:35:37.261 --> 01:35:40.828
that all during the week they
gotta pass everything, boating...

1270
01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:43.297
And I get 'em up on the top
of the mountain

1271
01:35:43.299 --> 01:35:45.533
and teach them glacial
survival and rescue,

1272
01:35:45.535 --> 01:35:47.838
so that at the end of
the week I show the kids...

1273
01:35:49.339 --> 01:35:51.739
"Look at the things you've
accomplished all week.

1274

They weren't easy.

1275
01:35:53.444 --> 01:35:55.810
It shows that you can accomplish
anything you want.

1276
01:35:55.812 --> 01:35:58.913
Now, you go back
and finish your time

1277
01:35:58.915 --> 01:36:01.716
and then go back and
get your high school diploma

1278

and that's the first big
accomplishment of your life."

1279
01:36:05.655 --> 01:36:09.523
While I was still on my knees, my
life changed in a matter of moments,

1280
01:36:09.525 --> 01:36:12.360
because I knew I was
through getting drunk,

1281
01:36:12.362 --> 01:36:15.264
and I knew that
I forgave my guards,

1282
01:36:15.266 --> 01:36:18.867
and I knew it was a miracle
because I forgave The Bird.

1283
01:36:18.869 --> 01:36:21.670
And that was
the first night,

1284
01:36:21.672 --> 01:36:25.707
first night in two and a half
years I didn't have a nightmare,

1285
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:28.010
and I haven't had one since.

1286
01:36:28.012 --> 01:36:30.312
Forgiveness
must be complete.

1287
01:36:30.314 --> 01:36:32.913
Uh, no matter
who the person is.

1288
01:36:32.915 --> 01:36:36.284
And I've had a few enemies,
even the last few years,

1289
01:36:36.286 --> 01:36:40.988
and the only way I can forgive 'em is
to pray for 'em, and that's what I do.

1290
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:43.425
Instead of hatin' 'em
I pray for 'em.

1291
01:36:43.427 --> 01:36:46.598
You just have to buckle up
and go onto greater things.

1292
01:36:49.333 --> 01:36:51.366

47 days on a raft?"

He says, "You're
entitled to travel pay."

1296
01:36:58.775 --> 01:37:01.777
I said, "What?"
He said...

1297
01:37:01.779 --> 01:37:04.446
That's a very
efficient guy.

1298
01:37:04.448 --> 01:37:10.318
He said, "Seven dollars
and 60 cents a day times 47."

1299
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.388
He made out a bill,
mailed it to Washington,

1300
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.458
and a week later
we got a response,

1301
01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.627
and it said,

1302
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:22.730
uh, "Request denied.

1303
01:37:22.732 --> 01:37:26.068
Reason: travel unauthorized."
