00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.650
Lieutenant Carapax,

2
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.518
tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.587
- They're cutting into it now.
- Ah. That's exciting.

4
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.365
I've had them working
around the clock

5
00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.391
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

6
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.527
Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

7
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.872
until we're ready
to show the board.

8
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.564
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

9
00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.934
- Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
- Sorry.

10
00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.435
Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

11
00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.671
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

12
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.007
We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

13
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.009
Well, push your men harder.

14
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.543
I've searched for 15 years.

15
00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:52.646
I don't want
to wait another second.

16
00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.856
Should've called before
making the trip out, Miss Kord.

17
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.247
This could be another decoy.

18
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.515
It's in there.

19
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.486
I can feel it.

20
00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.961
All right.
Let's do this.

21
00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.403
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

22
00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.106
Like you're six figures in debt.

23
00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:35.976
Okay.

24
00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:39.530
Anyone see him yet?

25
00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.118
We say nothing for now.

26
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.586
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

27
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.655
I'll tell him.

28
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.830
Are you crazy?

29
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.825
What the hell? Why not?

30
00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:52.858
Even good news...

31
00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.547
Sounds like bad news
when you deliver it.

32
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.007
And this is pretty bad news.

33
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.900
I can be joyful.

34
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.002
Your job is the balloon.

35
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.469
Hope I can handle it.

36
00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:04.838
Handle what?

37
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.840
Hey, hey, hey!

38
00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.643
The graduate is here!

39
00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.120
- How was your flight?
- Good.

40
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.146
- Are you hungry?
- Of course.

41
00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.215
Here. It's all they had.

42
00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.583
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.986
Nana!

44
00:05:21.113 --> 00:05:23.282
I'm so proud of you!

45
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:24.732
Finally together!

46
00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:25.792
Now we hug!

47
00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.461
Hey, where's Uncle Rudy?

48
00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:49.625
Welcome back, <i>pinche</i> college boy.

49
00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.526
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

50
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.053
No. No hugs, man.

51
00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.562
They got <i>Big Brother</i> watching.
There's cameras.

52
00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:56.056
I knew you were gonna
say something.

53
00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.565
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

54
00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:58.524
Yeah, and they're all so happy

55
00:05:58.557 --> 00:05:59.960
to finally catch you.

56
00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.203
You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

57
00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.494
that's gonna get us all busted.

58
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.730
Where'd you get this?

59
00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:05.597
I bought it for Jaime.

60
00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:07.043
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

61
00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:08.567
Come on. What are you doing?

62
00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.651
Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

63
00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.954
Good to know
some things don't change.

64
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.025
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

65
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.793
- Milagro.
- What?

66
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:36.830
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

67
00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:39.699
The truth? What is it?

68
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.934
- We...
- We...

69
00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:41.935
We're losing the house.

70
00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.737
What?

71
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.605
See?

72
00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.882
- He didn't take it that bad.
- No, no, no, losing the house?

73
00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.742
What does she mean,
losing the house?

74
00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.019
- The landlord tripled the rent.
- They gave us three months

75
00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:51.745
to come up with the money
or get out.

76
00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.713
I am so sorry, <i>flaquito.</i>

77
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.816
No. <i>Am</i> don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

78
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.918
It just means that
we're gonna have to

79
00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:00.129
bust our ass at the shop, right?

80
00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.056
Mmm... auto shop's gone.

81
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.091
- How?
- You can thank Kord for that.

82
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.060
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

83
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.329
Especially since your dad, he...

84
00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.631
He, uh... had a...

85
00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.833
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

86
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:14.834
What?

87
00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:16.036
I'm fine!

88
00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.646
Just a clogged pipe

89
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.439
but I'm totally fine now.

90
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.917
At least the food's the same.

91
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.777
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

92
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.112
You were working so hard,
<i>mi amor.</i>

93
00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:28.648
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

94
00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.650
Ma, I could have done something.

95
00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.985
I could have come back.

96
00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.187
I could have been here.
I could have...

97
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.622
<i>Animo,</i> Jaime.

98
00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.358
We figured it out.
We always do.

99
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.895
We have a lot
to be grateful for. <i>Mira...</i>

100
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.006
We're celebrating the first Reyes

101
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.674
to graduate from college!

102
00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.367
Yeah. And the last!

103
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.702
Yes, because you didn't apply.

104
00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:50.913
What, so I can get into debt

105
00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:53.239
for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

106
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.745
What? 25%?

107
00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.981
<i>Mi amor,</i>
these people make nothing.

108
00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.616
We are broke.

109
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.330
Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

110
00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.868
<i>Remember how Mom taught us salsa</i>

111
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.303
<i>right there on the front porch?</i>

112
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.271
<i>You were always better than me.</i>

113
00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:26.816
<i>Yeah. No, I
still think you don't know</i>

114
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.384
<i>how to dance salsa.</i>

115
00:08:28.408 --> 00:08:30.019
<i>Yeah, I got
two left feet. I can't help it.</i>

116
00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:31.377
<i>Yeah.</i>

117
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.813
<i>Do you remember
your 21st birthday?</i>

118
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.316
<i>I remember the first half.</i>

119
00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.918
<i>I can't believe
we're losing this place.</i>

120
00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.954
<i>It was rough.</i>

121
00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:42.364
<i>Yeah, well,
I'm not leaving again.</i>

122
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.226
What about grad school?

123
00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:48.394
Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

124
00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.230
I can't get us
into even more debt.

125
00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.199
<i>Animo,</i> bro.

126
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:55.735
Okay, you always land
on your feet.

127
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.103
You're "Jaime."

128
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.240
Thank you, but...

129
00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:04.444
This wasn't how it
was supposed to happen, Mili.

130
00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.246
What was supposed to happen?

131
00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.448
I was supposed to make it out.

132
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.383
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

133
00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.785
Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

134
00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:17.390
- You know what I meant.
- Yeah.

135
00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.427
Doesn't it bother you

136
00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:22.938
that they talk about progress
and get everything

137
00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.898
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

138
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.134
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys, <i>carnal.</i>

139
00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:30.904
That progress is not for us.

140
00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.406
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

141
00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:36.242
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

142
00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:37.786
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

143
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.179
and now they want that, too.

144
00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:41.181
I still have a degree, right?

145
00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:44.083
That's gotta mean something.
I'll get a job.

146
00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:47.720
Not just any job,
but a prime job.

147
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.674
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

148
00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.861
Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

149
00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.063
in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

150
00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.798
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

151
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.934
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

152
00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.770
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

153
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.440
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

154
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.777
Just watch.

155
00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:35.101
Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

156
00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:40.306
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

157
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.278
This is bullshit.

158
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.447
Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

159
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.782
for hooking me up
with this gig."

160
00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:53.286
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out the way you wanted.

161
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:54.563
How am I supposed to
get experience

162
00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.122
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

163
00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.457
Sounds like a "you" problem.

164
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.028
Seriously?

165
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.163
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

166
00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:05.932
Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

167
00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.934
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

168
00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:09.936
- With the actual code in hand...
- Hey.

169
00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.014
- We can move beyond the prototype phase.
- Check it out.

170
00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.306
Yes, yes.

171
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.208
There goes Victoria Kord.

172
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.286
Look at that walk.

173
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.214
She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

174
00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.415
I don't think so.

175
00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.593
- I'm gonna say hi.
- What? No...

176
00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:25.218
Good afternoon, ma'am.

177
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.320
If you want, we could.

178
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.956
It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

179
00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:32.425
Mm-hm.

180
00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.527
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

181
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.863
It's like our superpower.

182
00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.865
Okay. Back to work.

183
00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:42.135
I agree. That's a waste of time,
but General, I am telling you

184
00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.203
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

185
00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:46.272
is gonna blow you away.

186
00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.508
Yes. I look forward, also.

187
00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.611
Bye.

188
00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.312
Aunt Vicki?

189
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.218
Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

190
00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.953
I didn't know you were coming.

191
00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:02.855
Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

192
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.558
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

193
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.862
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

194
00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:15.001
<i>The world has changed.</i>

195
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:18.338
<i>Kord Industries faces
an unprecedented challenge</i>

196
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:23.076
<i>to secure our assets,
both here and abroad,</i>

197
00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.578
<i>from our promethium mines
in Guatemala,</i>

198
00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:30.216
<i>to our real estate developments
right here in Palmera City.</i>

199
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.354
<i>Introducing the future
of private policing:</i>

200
00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:39.225
<i>The O.M.A.C.,
the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

201
00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.893
Where are we going?

202
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.262
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

203
00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:45.231
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

204
00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:49.035
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

205
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:50.646
Be my lookout.

206
00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.139
I...

207
00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.109
<i>Using
revolutionary Kord symbiotech,</i>

208
00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:59.312
<i>the O.M.A.C. connects directly
into the human brain,</i>

209
00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.315
<i>to create a self-contained
war unit,</i>

210
00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:07.688
<i>allowing a single soldier to
harness the power of legions.</i>

211
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.991
<i>The O.M.A.C. ensures security
Kord can rely on.</i>

212
00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.193
<i>A future we can control.</i>

213
00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.929
<i>The O.M.A.C.</i>

214
00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:21.033
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

215
00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:25.972
So, this... project
was shut down years ago.

216
00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.074
Why have you relaunched it?

217
00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.943
Jennifer, the O.M.A.C.
is the future of this company.

218
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.512
You should be so excited.

219
00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:37.216
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

220
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.285
- That's classified.
- Mm.

221
00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.654
It's a secret.

222
00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:42.288
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

223
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.090
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

224
00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.558
It's gonna be an amazing evening

225
00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:47.360
with some
very interesting people,

226
00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:50.129
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

227
00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.264
All right, see you later.

228
00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.234
I know what you're doing, Vicki.

229
00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:57.136
We don't make weapons anymore.

230
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.005
Whoa, whoa, "we"?

231
00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:02.175
Who's "we"?

232
00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.645
You are nothing to this
company. You're an expense.

233
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.313
A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

234
00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.516
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

235
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.119
- doing your "charity work."
- My father would never...

236
00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:16.589
Look, your father was handed
a company I built... my company.

237
00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:18.692
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

238
00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:22.462
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

239
00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:24.674
and then after he'd done all
that, you know what he did?

240
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.165
He just disappeared,

241
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.635
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

242
00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:31.170
Your father
abandoned this company.

243
00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:34.407
And he abandoned you.

244
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.375
I won't let you do this.

245
00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:42.783
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

246
00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.718
Back away.

247
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.119
I'm not afraid of you.

248
00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.188
Maybe you should be.

249
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.157
Hey, hey!

250
00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.629
Uh, sh... she said
to back away, ma'am.

251
00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.099
Oooh-whee!

252
00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.168
That was lavish!

253
00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:04.237
Oh, shit.

254
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.675
And who are you, handsome?

255
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.410
Jaime Reyes.

256
00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:15.414
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

257
00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:18.551
- I'm...
- You, too, toilet. Go.

258
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.720
<i>Andale.</i>

259
00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.422
Thanks.

260
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.760
Where's the car?

261
00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:28.394
Uh, 47 minutes.

262
00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:33.499
Hey, are you okay? That was...

263
00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.268
I appreciate the chivalry,

264
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.103
but I can take care
of myself, okay?

265
00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:41.374
Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

266
00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:43.442
She's a Kord.
They're all dicks.

267
00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:46.279
Jenny Kord.

268
00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:49.750
We're not all dicks.

269
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.518
- Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
- Uh...

270
00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:55.756
Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

271
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.423
It's fine.

272
00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.868
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

273
00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:00.727
Okay. Yeah.

274
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:02.829
Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

275
00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:05.097
Okay.

276
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.109
I might be able to get you a job
somewhere else in our company.

277
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.702
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

278
00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:11.170
I'll do anything. Really.

279
00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:13.239
Anything, huh?

280
00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.308
Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

281
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.209
- Pre-law.
- I... Yeah.

282
00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:19.145
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

283
00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.313
Okay.

284
00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.448
- Text me.
- Okay.

285
00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:25.686
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

286
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.489
Nice to meet you, too...

287
00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:33.292
Jenny Kord.

288
00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.361
I think she might be into you.

289
00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.096
What? No.

290
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.633
Bye.

291
00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.435
- You think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:45.806
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

293
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:49.175
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

294
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.476
Hey, you know what?

295
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.788
Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

296
00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:53.412
- like <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>
- Okay.

297
00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.214
Except, she's
the rich white dude

298
00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.883
and you're the Maria!

299
00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.852
Yeah. Okay.

300
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.581
You drinking?

301
00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:06.519
- Just one.
- Okay.

302
00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.622
Don't tell your mother.

303
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.659
Can't sleep?

304
00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:14.828
No.

305
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.461
I'm not sleepy either.

306
00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:17.596
Yeah.

307
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.435
I planted those <i>nopales</i> with
<i>la</i> Nana,

308
00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:23.502
when you were a baby.

309
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.740
Look at them now.

310
00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:30.443
Like you and <i>la</i> Mili,
grown and beautiful.

311
00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.648
You okay?

312
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.515
Yeah.

313
00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:39.962
Sorry, <i>Apa,</i> it's just
everything right now

314
00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.587
feels so out of reach, and...

315
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.827
I feel like I failed you guys.

316
00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:54.533
We're on a journey, Jaime...

317
00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:58.504
This house, the <i>nopales,</i>
<i>el</i> auto shop.

318
00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.707
Everything.

319
00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:03.910
They're just a stop
in the journey.

320
00:19:03.944 --> 00:19:06.445
But this isn't the destination.

321
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:07.781
And what is it?

322
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.716
I don't know.

323
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.352
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

324
00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:16.957
Things don't last.

325
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.060
<i>La familia,</i> that's forever.

326
00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:21.594
That lasts.

327
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.999
Don't look so sad.

328
00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:31.370
Everyone has a purpose.

329
00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.874
You just haven't found yours.

330
00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:35.541
So what's your purpose then?

331
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:39.946
I'm still searching, too.

332
00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:43.582
But right now, it's this.

333
00:19:44.918 --> 00:19:47.553
Talking to you, right here.

334
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.863
See you in the morning.

335
00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:10.475
Okay.

336
00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:34.400
All right, okay, Jaime.
You got this.

337
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.508
God...

338
00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.044
Thank you, <i>Apa.</i>

339
00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.979
<i>Ya, pues,</i> you guys can go, okay?

340
00:20:46.012 --> 00:20:48.949
You're gonna be okay, <i>flaquito.</i>
You belong here.

341
00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:50.984
Yeah, <i>cabezon.</i>
You look like an asshole

342
00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:52.484
just like everybody else here.

343
00:20:52.753 --> 00:20:53.962
Come here!

344
00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:57.089
I forgot to give you a blessing!

345
00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:02.905
Okay.

346
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.530
- Bring your A-game, bro.
- Yeah.

347
00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.408
Bring a Molotov cocktail
to burn this dump down!

348
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:07.834
Okay!

349
00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:10.402
Hey, and get me a job, too!

350
00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:15.507
Jaime, Jaime, Jaime...

351
00:21:15.541 --> 00:21:16.910
They don't get out much.

352
00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:24.060
<i>Hello, I'm Victoria Kord,</i>

353
00:21:24.084 --> 00:21:27.187

Hi, nice to meet you.

358
00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:38.632
Deliveries are downstairs.

359
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:41.034
Uh... No, no, no.
My name is Jaime.

360
00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:43.569
Jaime Reyes.
I'm here to see Jenny Kord.

361
00:21:43.603 --> 00:21:44.747
Do you have
an appointment, Jamie?

362
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.140
- Um... It's Jaime, but...
- Sorry?

363
00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:50.143
Uh...
Yes, I do have an appointment.

364
00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:52.012
She said to drop by,
so I'm sure I should...

365
00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.780
- Oh, you can stand there.
- Okay.

366
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.093
Why don't you
have a seat, Jamie?

367
00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:57.651
Okay. Thank you.

368
00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:41.795
She found it.

369
00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:19.632
Jenny?

370
00:23:21.334 --> 00:23:23.036
Uh... Okay...

371
00:23:26.172 --> 00:23:27.607
Okay.

372
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:31.077
Just me and you.

373
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.250
No.

374
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:40.887
No.

375

No, no, no, no, no!

378
00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.338
There's been a security breach.
Lock the building.

379
00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:51.264
Lock the building!

380
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:01.674

381
00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:03.610

382
00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:05.779
- Hey!
- Oh!

383
00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:08.048

384
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:09.649
Oh... Sorry.

385
00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:12.318
Hey, Jenny Kord!
It's me. Jaime from yesterday.

386
00:24:12.352 --> 00:24:14.754
- I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
- No, that's all good.

387
00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:16.899
But you know, yesterday you
said you'd consider getting me a job

388
00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:18.758
and, you know,
I can't leave without one

389
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:20.260
even if that sounds too...

390
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:21.837
Do you think you could pause
for one second? Please...

391
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:23.763
Look, Jaime,
this is really a bad time.

392
00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:25.608
Okay. Let's... let's talk
while you have lunch.

393
00:24:25.632 --> 00:24:28.101
Please...

394
00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:30.214
Stay on comms.

395
00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:33.873
You said you'd
do anything, right?

396
00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:35.775
Yeah. Basically, anything.

397
00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:37.143
Here.

398
00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:38.878
- Guard that with your life.
- Okay.

399
00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:40.246
But do not open it.

400
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.215
Do not touch it!
Don't even look at it!

401
00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:43.793
Okay. I'm just gonna
guard it with my life.

402
00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:45.218
Yeah, you're a quick learner.

403
00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:46.886
- Yeah.
- Good. Now go!

404
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.154
- Okay. Okay!
- Go, go, go!

405
00:24:50.857 --> 00:24:53.726
Lock up the south entrances!
You two, with me!

406
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.950
So, you went in to get us jobs,

407
00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:19.853
and all you brought back
was a hamburger?

408
00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:21.197
Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

409
00:25:21.221 --> 00:25:22.755
You haven't looked?

410
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:24.390
She said not to open it. I...

411
00:25:24.424 --> 00:25:25.892
Oh...

412
00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:27.325
- She's not here.
- What?

413
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.041
Open it!

414
00:25:32.298 --> 00:25:34.367
Okay, okay. One look.

415
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.669
Oh, you guys are so childish.

416
00:25:38.138 --> 00:25:39.739

417
00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:40.832
Huh.

418
00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:42.059
Looks like a bug, right?

419
00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:45.211
Why was she hiding it?

420
00:25:45.245 --> 00:25:47.380
I don't know.

421
00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:49.983
Hm.
It's kind of a letdown.

422
00:25:50.016 --> 00:25:51.217
The world's biggest tick.

423
00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:54.954
Okay. You guys are the ones
who wanted to see it.

425
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.435
Milagro. Okay, look. Very mature,
but she said to not open it, so please...

426
00:25:59.459 --> 00:26:01.895
Mmm, she said for you
to not open it, bro.

427
00:26:01.928 --> 00:26:04.130
Stop, stop. Hey, <i>oye.</i>

428
00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:06.842
- It's heavy.
- Okay, okay.

429
00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:08.077
I'm gonna use a motor,
all right?

430
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:09.445
- I'm gonna get my drill.
- Wait, wait!

431
00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:11.304
Don't get the drill!
What are you doing?

432
00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:13.106
God, I hate when you do that.

433
00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:15.775

Ooh. Is that

435
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.782

436
00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:23.983
I don't know.

440
00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:34.327
It doesn't like me!

441
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.930

It's on your face!

442
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:38.831

Oh, man! I'm trying
to help you, <i>cabezon!</i>

448

- What did you do to my car, man?

533
00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:16.269
Hey, hey,
do you have insurance, man?

534
00:32:16.302 --> 00:32:17.604
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

535
00:32:17.638 --> 00:32:19.205
<i>Threat approaching.</i>

536
00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:28.080
What the hell?

537
00:32:42.562 --> 00:32:44.731
Oh, no, what did you do?

538
00:32:44.765 --> 00:32:46.508
<i>Host protection successful.</i>

539
00:32:46.532 --> 00:32:48.267
Hey, hey, look, is anyone hurt?

540
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:50.436
Oh, no. Calm down.
I can explain.

541
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.138
There's nothing to worry about.

542
00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:54.808
Oh, my God, there's a kid!
It wasn't me, I swear.

543
00:32:54.841 --> 00:32:57.143
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm not in control...

544
00:32:57.176 --> 00:32:58.776
<i>Systems check complete.</i>

545
00:32:59.478 --> 00:33:01.080
Oh, no, not again.

546
00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:09.221
I think it just hit me.

547
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:16.162
Let me explain that again.

548
00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:18.197
He's technically
not a missing person,

549
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.498
but he is missing.

550
00:33:19.532 --> 00:33:21.802
- But also, he is...
- Possessed!

551
00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:28.307
He exploded out of
the roof. With rockets on his back.

552
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:29.586
Shouldn't we be
out there looking for him?

553
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.612
No, no, no!

554
00:33:33.212 --> 00:33:34.413
I'm on hold again.

555
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.584
<i>Return landing successful.</i>

556
00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:40.519
Never mind. We found him.

557
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.522
Why are you naked?

558
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:46.525
Jaime?

559
00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.937
Yo, put those <i>huevos</i> away, bro.

560
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:50.215
Just like when he was little.

561
00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:51.865
Because he's cold!

562
00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:53.575
Cover your balls, Jaime.

563
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.712
It's Jamie, not Jaime.

564
00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:58.739
Oh, no.

565
00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:15.956
What are you guys doing?

566
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:18.934
You okay?

567
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:19.693
He's alive.

568
00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:22.729
Jaime. Do you feel okay, <i>mijo?</i>

569
00:34:23.997 --> 00:34:25.431
Oh!

570
00:34:25.464 --> 00:34:29.502
No. No way.

571
00:34:29.535 --> 00:34:31.203
Jaime, listen,

572
00:34:31.237 --> 00:34:33.239
- there's something on...
- No, not now, Milagro.

573
00:34:33.272 --> 00:34:35.217
- Jaime, I'm serious.
- No, no, no. Not now, Milagro.

574
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:36.451
- Not now!
- There's something on your...

575
00:34:36.475 --> 00:34:37.944
Hey, Jaime, keep that blanket

576
00:34:37.978 --> 00:34:39.445
now that it touched
your <i>chorizo.</i>

577
00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:40.814
What is going on?

578
00:34:40.847 --> 00:34:42.381
You can't fly.

579
00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.719
You can't fly.
Superman can fly.

580
00:34:45.752 --> 00:34:48.889
Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

581
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:52.558
Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

582
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:53.994
Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

583
00:34:54.027 --> 00:34:56.697
Yeah, right. Okay.

584
00:35:04.037 --> 00:35:06.405
I tried telling him.

585
00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:08.441
Okay, guys. I... I need
to go find Jenny Kord,

586
00:35:08.474 --> 00:35:10.285
'cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

587
00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:11.778
Uh, where are my shoes?

588
00:35:11.812 --> 00:35:14.413
Come on, where are my... shoes.

589
00:35:14.447 --> 00:35:17.416
Not the 84s!

590
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.318
These were my favorite shoes.

591
00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:20.687
Okay, okay.

592
00:35:20.721 --> 00:35:22.789
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

593
00:35:22.823 --> 00:35:24.356
<i>Ama,</i> I don't know.

594
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.258
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

595
00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.494
- Cut what?
- And flew into orbit.

596
00:35:28.527 --> 00:35:30.305
- Flew into orbit?
<i>- Apa,</i> I don't know.

597
00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:32.340
- That's why I need Jenny. Okay?
- I am calling the police.

598
00:35:32.364 --> 00:35:36.402
No, no. Don't call the police.
No police. They work for Kord.

599
00:35:36.435 --> 00:35:37.938
What do you think
Kord's gonna do

600
00:35:37.971 --> 00:35:39.840
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

601
00:35:39.873 --> 00:35:42.642
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

602
00:35:43.677 --> 00:35:45.011
They're gonna lock his ass up.

603
00:35:45.045 --> 00:35:46.913
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

604
00:35:46.947 --> 00:35:48.380
so that we don't tell anybody.

605
00:35:48.414 --> 00:35:49.592
And it's not like
the government isn't

606
00:35:49.616 --> 00:35:50.960
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

607
00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:53.653
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

608
00:35:53.687 --> 00:35:58.357
- This is Area 51!
- Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

609
00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.994
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

610
00:36:01.027 --> 00:36:02.729
are gonna be all over this,

611
00:36:02.763 --> 00:36:04.640
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

612
00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:08.334
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

613
00:36:08.367 --> 00:36:10.580
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

614
00:36:10.604 --> 00:36:12.471
You are not leaving this house.

615
00:36:12.505 --> 00:36:14.808
<i>Ama,</i> I'm 22! Besides,
what if she's in danger?

616
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:16.610
What if she's in danger?

617
00:36:16.643 --> 00:36:18.520
- Jaime, you flew out of the roof.
- You don't understand.

618
00:36:18.544 --> 00:36:20.579
- He's into her.
- Oh, he totally is.

619
00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:21.948
- No, I'm not.
- Oh!

620
00:36:21.982 --> 00:36:23.593
- Stalked her Insta.
- Where'd I put my...

621
00:36:23.617 --> 00:36:25.752
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

622
00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:27.988
And she's single, by the way.

623
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:30.556
Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

624
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:31.858
She's single?

625
00:36:31.892 --> 00:36:33.727
I thought you weren't into her.

626
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.804
What are you doing
with my phone?

627
00:36:34.828 --> 00:36:35.828
You left it unlocked.

628
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:37.614
It's like Maria Mercedez.

629
00:36:37.698 --> 00:36:39.658
Only she's the rich white guy

630
00:36:39.741 --> 00:36:41.533
and he doesn't have a pot to piss in.

631
00:36:41.534 --> 00:36:43.713
Yes, the Maria!
Yes, I said the same thing.

632
00:36:43.737 --> 00:36:45.005
But <i>Maria la del Barrio.</i>

633
00:36:45.163 --> 00:36:46.456
Even better!

634
00:36:47.249 --> 00:36:49.418
I'm proud to say

635
00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:51.837
I'm Jaime from the neighborhood.

636
00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:53.839
He left his hometown

637
00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:57.551
To make a living.

638
00:36:57.617 --> 00:36:59.128
- You hear that, <i>flaco?</i>
- Rudy!

639
00:37:04.124 --> 00:37:05.625
No. No, no.

640
00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:07.961
No. No. No!

641
00:37:07.994 --> 00:37:09.395
Jaime!

642
00:37:09.428 --> 00:37:13.033
No! No! No!

643
00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:14.358
Ma!

644
00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:16.111
He took the Taco!

645
00:37:16.195 --> 00:37:18.071
Don't be silly!

646
00:37:30.583 --> 00:37:33.854
So itchy, this thing.

647
00:37:33.887 --> 00:37:34.887
Ay, okay.

648
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.558
No way.

649
00:37:40.593 --> 00:37:41.962
What the...

650
00:37:43.163 --> 00:37:44.597
Wait, what?

651
00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:46.765
Jenny?

652
00:37:48.467 --> 00:37:51.470
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing here?

653
00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:53.607
- Just go. They're coming.
- Who's them?

654
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.841
Them!

655
00:37:56.176 --> 00:37:57.452
- Oh, God. Okay!
- Let's go! Let's go!

656
00:37:57.476 --> 00:37:59.045
Okay, okay! Oh, my God!

657
00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.680
I told you to go!

658
00:38:00.714 --> 00:38:02.554
You should have started with,
"they have guns."

659
00:38:03.183 --> 00:38:04.516
Watch out!

660
00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:10.422
Oh, Rudy's gonna kill me.

661
00:38:15.095 --> 00:38:17.529
Oh, my headlights!

662
00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:19.531
No! My mirrors!

663
00:38:19.565 --> 00:38:22.769
What the hell, man?

664
00:38:22.802 --> 00:38:25.639
What's wrong with you? <i>Cabezon!</i>

665
00:38:25.672 --> 00:38:27.073
Do you want some water?

666
00:38:27.107 --> 00:38:28.141
My tailgate!

667
00:38:28.174 --> 00:38:30.176
No, I'm... I'm good. I'm fine.

668
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.811
Okay.

669
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.149
What did you do to the Taco?

670
00:38:36.182 --> 00:38:38.118
And that... that's Rudy.

671
00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:40.987
My name's Cesar, okay? And
only my friends call me Rudy.

672
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:42.461
- I'm Jenny.
- "I'm Jenny."

673
00:38:42.488 --> 00:38:43.823
Hi, Jenny.

674
00:38:43.857 --> 00:38:45.825
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

675
00:38:45.859 --> 00:38:48.137
Thinking about turning our
house into a nuclear power plant?

676
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:49.595
I went swimming out there

677
00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:51.073
by where your family
has that company.

678
00:38:51.097 --> 00:38:53.767
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

679
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.969
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

680
00:38:56.002 --> 00:38:58.537
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

681
00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.808
- Where is it?
- Yeah.

682
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:04.210
Allow me.

683
00:39:04.244 --> 00:39:05.712
Rudy! What?

684
00:39:05.745 --> 00:39:07.681
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

685
00:39:10.984 --> 00:39:12.728
I thought the
<i>chingaderas</i> would come out.

686
00:39:12.752 --> 00:39:14.220
- Come out?
- Jeez.

687
00:39:14.254 --> 00:39:16.374
- What is he talking about?
- He's talking about this.

688
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.993
Oh, I forgot how bad it looks.

689
00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:21.627
Gross! Cover that up!

690
00:39:21.628 --> 00:39:23.239
No, it doesn't look that bad.

691
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.197
You can barely see it.

692
00:39:23.263 --> 00:39:24.898
I've seen worse.

693
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:26.666
- Where?
- You don't wanna know.

694
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.567
Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

695
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.569
It's... it's called the Scarab.

696
00:39:30.603 --> 00:39:33.273
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

697
00:39:33.306 --> 00:39:35.775
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

698
00:39:35.809 --> 00:39:37.143
Oh, that's nice.

699
00:39:37.177 --> 00:39:38.611
- Weapon?
- What did she say?

700
00:39:38.645 --> 00:39:40.947
What?

701
00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:43.021
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

702
00:39:43.049 --> 00:39:45.785
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

703
00:39:45.819 --> 00:39:47.859
No, I swear to you, I had
no idea this would happen.

704
00:39:47.887 --> 00:39:49.689
I mean, come on.

705
00:39:49.723 --> 00:39:51.600
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

706
00:39:51.624 --> 00:39:52.859
It has to choose you.

707
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.930
So I'm guessing it's chosen you.

708
00:39:56.963 --> 00:39:58.530
No more blind dates.

709
00:39:58.564 --> 00:40:01.735
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

710
00:40:01.768 --> 00:40:04.137
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

711
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.572
because my aunt will kill
us all just to get it back.

712
00:40:06.606 --> 00:40:07.850
Kill us?

713
00:40:07.874 --> 00:40:09.151
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

714
00:40:09.175 --> 00:40:10.910
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

715
00:40:10.944 --> 00:40:13.024
Yeah.

716
00:40:13.025 --> 00:40:14.456
Like the assassins in Mexico?

717
00:40:16.316 --> 00:40:18.594
I'm so sorry I
put you all in this situation.

718
00:40:18.618 --> 00:40:20.754
I had no idea it would activate.

719
00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:22.088
Really. I didn't know.

720
00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:23.990
That's convenient.

721
00:40:24.024 --> 00:40:25.557
But she already said
she didn't know.

722
00:40:25.591 --> 00:40:27.627
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

723
00:40:29.629 --> 00:40:33.700
We are going
to figure it out. We always do.

724
00:40:33.733 --> 00:40:36.836
Come on, we are the Reyes.

725
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.139
We've dealt with harder things.

726
00:40:39.172 --> 00:40:41.207
We have?

727
00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:45.678
<i>Animo.</i> We can do this.

728
00:40:46.713 --> 00:40:49.149
Yeah. Yeah, <i>Apa.</i>

729
00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:50.817
He's right.

730
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.321
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

731
00:40:55.355 --> 00:40:57.957
You know, before it busts
another hole in our house.

732
00:40:57.991 --> 00:41:00.026
Exactly.

733
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.796
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

734
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.198
But we need the key.

735
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:07.967
Okay, so where's the key?

736
00:41:08.001 --> 00:41:10.003
At the Kord building.

737
00:41:10.036 --> 00:41:12.248
And they're probably on high alert
over there since I took the Scarab.

738
00:41:12.272 --> 00:41:15.909
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

739
00:41:15.942 --> 00:41:17.710
Wide area motion imagery?

740
00:41:17.744 --> 00:41:19.846
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

741
00:41:21.014 --> 00:41:23.049
I really don't...

742
00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:25.628
Because I've been working on
something that I believe can help us.

743
00:41:25.652 --> 00:41:28.254
And it's almost finished.

744
00:41:28.288 --> 00:41:30.090
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

745
00:41:30.123 --> 00:41:31.191
Mm. I love you, Ma.

746
00:41:31.224 --> 00:41:33.159
Give me a couple hours.

747
00:42:03.756 --> 00:42:05.434
You're aware
that if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

748
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:06.893
you'd be the most powerful

749
00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:08.728
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

750
00:42:08.761 --> 00:42:10.773
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

751
00:42:10.797 --> 00:42:12.966
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

752
00:42:14.234 --> 00:42:16.302
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

753
00:42:16.336 --> 00:42:19.272
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

754
00:42:19.305 --> 00:42:22.275
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

755
00:42:22.308 --> 00:42:24.077
during the anti-communist

756
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.847
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

757
00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:30.116
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

758
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.118
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

759
00:42:32.152 --> 00:42:33.720
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

760
00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:38.691
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

761
00:42:38.725 --> 00:42:40.860
- When will it be ready?
- Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

762
00:42:40.894 --> 00:42:44.197
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

763
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.899
We have a problem.

764
00:42:45.932 --> 00:42:47.967
Well, if you'll excuse us.

765
00:42:48.001 --> 00:42:51.371
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

766
00:42:53.072 --> 00:42:56.109
You lost her? How?

767
00:42:56.142 --> 00:42:57.944
My men saw someone helping her.

768
00:42:57.977 --> 00:43:00.847
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

769
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.150
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

770
00:43:04.184 --> 00:43:07.787
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

771
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.422
This time I'll do it personally.

772
00:43:09.455 --> 00:43:12.225
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

773
00:43:12.258 --> 00:43:15.028
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

774
00:43:15.061 --> 00:43:18.765
Just think of how much suffering
your body has been through.

775
00:43:18.798 --> 00:43:21.100
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

776
00:43:21.134 --> 00:43:24.837
My God... What <i>we've</i> done.

777
00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:30.143
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

778
00:43:30.176 --> 00:43:33.246
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

779
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.716
How badly crippled you were?

780
00:43:37.483 --> 00:43:39.018
How broken?

781
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.424
I am just trying to fix you.

782
00:43:44.457 --> 00:43:45.758
Okay?

783
00:43:48.962 --> 00:43:50.029
Good.

784
00:43:50.063 --> 00:43:51.831
I have to go back to the party.

785
00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:55.802
Now, go get me that Scarab.

786
00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:07.280
That's it?

787
00:44:07.313 --> 00:44:10.149
I call it, <i>El Chapulin.</i>

788
00:44:11.384 --> 00:44:13.419
Why?

789
00:44:13.453 --> 00:44:15.288
You know,
when you make something cool,

790
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:17.523
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

791
00:44:17.557 --> 00:44:20.560
Here, be useful. Hold that.

792
00:44:20.593 --> 00:44:22.153
You're sure that this one works?

793
00:44:22.562 --> 00:44:24.264
Thank you. Yes.

794
00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:28.268
Unlike the junk that Kord
makes, my tech delivers.

795
00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:30.003
Okay. You could have
just said yes.

796
00:44:30.036 --> 00:44:31.947
Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

797
00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:33.282
Hit the yellow switch.

798
00:44:33.306 --> 00:44:35.275
I just did.

799
00:44:37.611 --> 00:44:39.445
Okay.

800
00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:41.223
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

801
00:44:41.247 --> 00:44:42.915
It's going on your tab.

802
00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:45.018
So just give me, like, one step.

803
00:44:45.051 --> 00:44:46.251
Just gotta give it a little...

804
00:44:49.455 --> 00:44:51.958
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

805
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:54.294
That's... that's great.
Uh, so it works.

806
00:44:54.327 --> 00:44:57.530
Uh, yeah, it works.

807
00:44:57.563 --> 00:44:59.232
I'll keep the truck running.

808
00:44:59.265 --> 00:45:00.265
- Let's go.
- Wow.

809
00:45:02.535 --> 00:45:04.103
"So it works?"

810
00:45:07.173 --> 00:45:08.274
Guys!

811
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:11.311
Something's happening.

812
00:45:16.516 --> 00:45:18.017
What the hell is this?

813
00:45:21.154 --> 00:45:23.122
<i>El Chapulin Colorado!</i>

814
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:27.894
<i>So join me and my little pals</i>

815
00:45:27.927 --> 00:45:29.295
<i>and all of our Kord
subsidiaries...</i>

816
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:31.097
The key's here.

817
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.268
<i>Around the globe,
to build a better future.</i>

818
00:45:35.301 --> 00:45:37.203
<i>A Kord future.</i>

819
00:45:39.505 --> 00:45:42.141
She seemed so different
back then.

820
00:45:42.175 --> 00:45:46.145
Vicki and my grandfather
started Kord Industries together...

821
00:45:46.179 --> 00:45:49.048
and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

822
00:45:49.082 --> 00:45:52.085
Then, when my grandfather died,

823
00:45:52.118 --> 00:45:55.455
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

824
00:45:55.488 --> 00:45:58.124
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

825
00:45:59.058 --> 00:46:00.627
- Seems kind of...
- Sexist?

826
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:02.128
Yeah.

827
00:46:02.161 --> 00:46:04.030
Yeah.

828
00:46:04.063 --> 00:46:06.399
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

829
00:46:06.432 --> 00:46:08.468
in a different direction.

830
00:46:08.501 --> 00:46:11.871
So, Victoria became obsessed
with erasing my father's legacy.

831
00:46:13.506 --> 00:46:15.174
Could I get a hand over here?

832
00:46:16.242 --> 00:46:18.144
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

833
00:46:18.177 --> 00:46:20.213
- Just hold this.
- Okay.

834
00:46:20.246 --> 00:46:22.081
There's a signal blocking
our feed.

835
00:46:22.115 --> 00:46:23.349
We're being jammed out.

836
00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:29.623
Lieutenant Carapax?
We got a problem.

837
00:46:37.597 --> 00:46:39.532
- This is the key?
- Yeah.

838
00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:43.002
Okay, let's go.

839
00:46:43.035 --> 00:46:44.035
Let's go.

840
00:46:57.316 --> 00:47:00.586
This is why I
don't let anyone drive the Taco!

841
00:47:00.621 --> 00:47:04.357
To be honest, I didn't
think the <i>Chapulin</i> would work.

842
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.160
Yeah, that's Rudy.
He's like the Mexican Doc Brown.

843
00:47:07.193 --> 00:47:08.695
No kidding. Okay.

844
00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:10.664
- So that's all you need?
- Yeah.

845
00:47:10.697 --> 00:47:13.132
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I thought

846
00:47:13.166 --> 00:47:15.168
it was gonna be
way harder than that.

847
00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:16.469
Oh, shit.

848
00:47:17.336 --> 00:47:20.206
The Scarab, now!

849
00:47:20.239 --> 00:47:21.274
What is he doing here?

850
00:47:23.242 --> 00:47:25.578
Should we run?
He's not slowing down.

851
00:47:25.612 --> 00:47:27.246
Watch out! Watch out!

852
00:47:36.088 --> 00:47:37.199
<i>Hola, Jaime.</i>

853
00:47:40.627 --> 00:47:42.495
Oh, my gosh. How'd you do that?

854
00:47:42.528 --> 00:47:43.664
I have no idea.

855
00:47:48.534 --> 00:47:49.736
Oh, he's pissed.

856
00:48:07.621 --> 00:48:09.489
What the hell is that thing?

857
00:48:09.522 --> 00:48:10.657
The O.M.A.C.

858
00:48:13.292 --> 00:48:16.329
You're going to regret that.

859
00:48:16.362 --> 00:48:17.698
<i>Defending host.</i>

860
00:48:17.731 --> 00:48:19.700
Oh, my God. Quick!
Go find Rudy!

861
00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:22.636
<i>Engaging
threat.</i> Engage? No!

862
00:48:24.504 --> 00:48:25.706
Oh, shit!

863
00:48:30.276 --> 00:48:32.476
Okay, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, wait! Don't!

864
00:48:35.548 --> 00:48:38.084
What did you do that for?
I told you not to engage.

865
00:48:48.695 --> 00:48:50.673
<i>I have
an arsenal at my disposal.</i>

866
00:48:50.697 --> 00:48:52.131
No! No weapons.

867
00:48:55.568 --> 00:48:58.371
Ooh. And my song, too! Ay!

868
00:48:59.873 --> 00:49:01.541
- Cesar!
- What?

869
00:49:01.574 --> 00:49:03.214
- What the heck, where's <i>cabezon?</i>
- There!

870
00:49:05.812 --> 00:49:07.246
Hey! Calm down!

871
00:49:12.886 --> 00:49:14.587
Oh, shit!

872
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:16.701
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Let's go, let's go!

873
00:49:20.259 --> 00:49:21.862
Let me talk to him.

874
00:49:21.895 --> 00:49:22.863
<i>Verbal
communication is ill-advised</i>

875
00:49:22.896 --> 00:49:24.831
<i>in a combat scenario.</i>

876
00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:27.385
Hey, man, look! I think this is
just one big misunderstanding...

877
00:49:29.302 --> 00:49:30.445
I didn't mean
to punch you back there.

878
00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:32.438
I promise, I would never...

879
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:34.440
I'm not
in control of this thing.

880
00:49:35.776 --> 00:49:38.177
No, no, no, let me explain!

881
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.780
Never mind. He's not listening.

882
00:49:39.813 --> 00:49:41.423
<i>Permission to take over host.</i>

883
00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:42.683
Yes! Anything!

884
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:53.492
<i>Watch and learn, Jaime.</i>

885
00:49:55.595 --> 00:49:57.563
Hey, wait, where you going?
Come on.

886
00:49:59.165 --> 00:50:00.333
What the hell?

887
00:50:10.476 --> 00:50:12.278
Oh, my God. My hands are guns.

888
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:19.285
<i>Threat neutralized.</i>

889
00:50:19.318 --> 00:50:20.678
Oh!
What's with the blades?

890
00:50:23.824 --> 00:50:25.233
<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

891
00:50:25.257 --> 00:50:26.927
No, no, no.
Put the blades away.

892
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.171
<i>Would you
like to use a different weapon?</i>

893
00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:31.230
No. I mean,
we don't have to kill him.

894
00:50:31.263 --> 00:50:32.474
<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

895
00:50:32.498 --> 00:50:34.266
Are you even listening to me?

896
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.645
<i>Eliminating threat.</i>

897
00:50:35.669 --> 00:50:37.871
Stop! I'm not a killer.

898
00:50:37.904 --> 00:50:39.606
<i>Command accepted.</i>

899
00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.642
Oh!

900
00:50:43.542 --> 00:50:44.543
<i>Cabezon!</i>

901
00:50:44.577 --> 00:50:45.912
Jaime!

902
00:50:46.647 --> 00:50:47.647
Uncle Rudy.

903
00:50:49.716 --> 00:50:51.718
No!

904
00:50:51.752 --> 00:50:53.386
Holy shit!

905
00:50:54.286 --> 00:50:56.422
Rudy!

906
00:50:56.455 --> 00:50:58.424
Where do you think you're going?

907
00:51:00.292 --> 00:51:02.561
Hey! You guys
gotta get out of here!

908
00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:09.201
What's with this guy?

909
00:51:09.903 --> 00:51:10.904
What?

910
00:51:10.937 --> 00:51:12.571
Stupid boy.

911
00:51:12.606 --> 00:51:15.274
Did you think you could beat me?

912
00:51:15.307 --> 00:51:16.919
<i>Recommend lethal measures.</i>

913
00:51:16.943 --> 00:51:18.511
I told you, I'm not a...

<i>Warning,
host concussion detected.</i>

915
00:51:32.525 --> 00:51:33.936
You should have finished me

916
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.428
when you had the chance.

917
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:37.931
He's gonna kill him.

918
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.710
No. He's not.

919
00:51:49.743 --> 00:51:50.844
Hold on.

920
00:51:54.047 --> 00:51:57.784
Please, just don't
hurt my family.

921
00:51:57.818 --> 00:52:00.754
The love you feel
for your family

922
00:52:00.787 --> 00:52:02.521
makes you weak.

923
00:52:02.555 --> 00:52:04.490
Cesar! What are you doing?

924
00:52:04.523 --> 00:52:06.292
Okay, Kord girl.

925
00:52:06.325 --> 00:52:10.296
When I tell you, pull that
handbrake and pull it hard.

926
00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:11.808
- You ready?
- Oh, my gosh, this is insane.

927
00:52:11.832 --> 00:52:15.401
Three, two, one.

928
00:52:15.434 --> 00:52:16.636
Now!

929
00:52:25.779 --> 00:52:27.379
<i>Cabezon,</i> let's get outta here!

930
00:52:38.591 --> 00:52:41.293

931
00:52:41.327 --> 00:52:43.029
Jenny! Snap out of it!

932
00:52:43.063 --> 00:52:44.931
- Okay.
- Don't look, don't look!

933
00:52:44.965 --> 00:52:46.700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

934
00:52:48.702 --> 00:52:50.402
I'm fine, Rudy. Thank you.

935
00:52:50.436 --> 00:52:53.339
All right. I got a T-shirt.
On the side.

936
00:52:53.372 --> 00:52:55.441
All right. Okay.

937
00:52:55.474 --> 00:52:57.010
Man...

938
00:52:57.043 --> 00:52:59.411
Oh, that psycho
almost killed me.

939
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:03.917
You got the key?

940
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:05.719
- All right.
- Yeah.

941
00:53:05.752 --> 00:53:08.088
Good. Now, let's go get
that Scarab taken out of you.

942
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:10.322
- Khaji-Da.
- Khaji <i>que?</i>

943
00:53:10.356 --> 00:53:12.458
The Scarab's name is Khaji-Da.

944
00:53:12.491 --> 00:53:13.794
How do you know?

945
00:53:13.827 --> 00:53:16.495
I... Something happened
back there. My...

946
00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:18.999
It's like I feel it in my mind.
Is that crazy?

947
00:53:21.034 --> 00:53:23.103
You're becoming symbiotic.

948
00:53:23.136 --> 00:53:24.905
- What?
- Okay, where to now?

949
00:53:27.107 --> 00:53:28.708
- Take that exit.
- What? Hold on!

950
00:53:28.742 --> 00:53:29.752
No, no, no!

951
00:53:32.511 --> 00:53:34.714
Does anybody in
this town know how to drive?

952
00:53:44.456 --> 00:53:45.659
Oh!

953
00:53:48.394 --> 00:53:49.939
They're not gonna
look for you here?

954
00:53:49.963 --> 00:53:51.798
No one's been here
since I was eight.

955
00:54:15.755 --> 00:54:17.691
Yeah, I get it.
That makes sense.

956
00:54:23.129 --> 00:54:25.866
So, your dad was all
obsessed with Scarabs, huh?

957
00:54:29.903 --> 00:54:30.937
Where are we?

958
00:54:36.843 --> 00:54:37.844
No way.

959
00:54:40.579 --> 00:54:41.815
Wait.

960
00:54:41.848 --> 00:54:44.550
Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

961
00:54:46.686 --> 00:54:47.854
Wow!

962
00:54:47.888 --> 00:54:49.689
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

963
00:54:49.723 --> 00:54:52.458
Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

964
00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:55.594
Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

965
00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:57.197
But just, uh...

966
00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:01.533
I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

967
00:55:01.567 --> 00:55:04.470
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

968
00:55:04.503 --> 00:55:06.172
Oh, I get it though.

969
00:55:06.206 --> 00:55:11.543
Eccentric billionaire, a
genius. <i>El Escarabajo Azul.</i>

970
00:55:11.577 --> 00:55:14.781
Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

971
00:55:14.814 --> 00:55:16.482
You can call me Cesar or Rudy.

972
00:55:16.515 --> 00:55:19.085
You can call me whatever
you want, I don't care.

973
00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:20.239
Hey, how come all of this...

974
00:55:23.023 --> 00:55:25.524
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

975
00:55:25.557 --> 00:55:28.094
Um, what were you saying?

976
00:55:28.128 --> 00:55:30.196
Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like...

977
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.866
Nicer? Less ridiculous?

978
00:55:32.899 --> 00:55:34.868
No. But I mean...

979
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:40.640
Like, look at this. It's
like Batman's stuff, but...

980
00:55:40.674 --> 00:55:42.541
like if he had ADHD
or something.

981
00:55:42.574 --> 00:55:44.476
Batman's a fascist.

982
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:47.513
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

983
00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:51.718
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

984
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:56.056
So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

985
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:58.825
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

986
00:55:58.858 --> 00:56:00.994
Let's crack into this sucker.

987
00:56:05.031 --> 00:56:07.233
- Damn, you stink.
- This is your shirt.

988
00:56:07.267 --> 00:56:09.936
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

989
00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:12.081
That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

990
00:56:17.877 --> 00:56:19.578
Jeez.

991
00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:21.214
When is this day gonna end?

992
00:56:28.688 --> 00:56:29.756
Whoa.

993
00:56:30.924 --> 00:56:33.159
Ay.

994
00:56:35.662 --> 00:56:37.063
Is everything okay?

995
00:56:37.097 --> 00:56:41.301
Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

996
00:56:41.334 --> 00:56:45.205
Yeah, I think they, uh...
I think they fit.

997
00:56:45.238 --> 00:56:46.773
And they're comfy, too, so...

998
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:51.244
Good.

999
00:56:51.277 --> 00:56:54.147
It must have been so cool
growing up in a place like this, no?

1000
00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.949
Honestly, it was...

1001
00:56:55.982 --> 00:56:58.151
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

1002
00:56:59.753 --> 00:57:01.097
It was just you three in here?

1003
00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:02.554
Yeah.

1004
00:57:02.588 --> 00:57:04.024
That was my mother's
last painting.

1005
00:57:05.025 --> 00:57:06.326
Why'd she stop?

1006
00:57:06.359 --> 00:57:08.228
My mom died when I was six.

1007
00:57:10.263 --> 00:57:12.899
Oh... We don't...

1008
00:57:12.932 --> 00:57:14.677
- I'm so sorry to...
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

1009
00:57:14.701 --> 00:57:15.702
It's fine.

1010
00:57:17.771 --> 00:57:18.772
What was she like?

1011
00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:21.674
She was great.

1012
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:24.978
She was great.

1013
00:57:28.248 --> 00:57:30.750
She changed my dad's life.

1014
00:57:30.784 --> 00:57:32.786
She was the one who taught him
that the world

1015
00:57:32.819 --> 00:57:34.087
is a place to protect.

1016
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.121
Nice.

1017
00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:41.194
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

1018
00:57:45.031 --> 00:57:47.634
He obsessed over the Scarab

1019
00:57:47.667 --> 00:57:49.568
and he would disappear for days.

1020
00:57:51.271 --> 00:57:52.939
Sometimes weeks.

1021
00:57:53.973 --> 00:57:55.241
And one day, he...

1022
00:57:57.077 --> 00:57:58.344
he left and...

1023
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.681
didn't come back.

1024
00:58:02.982 --> 00:58:04.350
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

1025
00:58:08.888 --> 00:58:11.624
You're really lucky.

1026
00:58:11.658 --> 00:58:15.594
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

1027
00:58:16.429 --> 00:58:18.898
Your house is full of love.

1028
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:23.136
A family.

1029
00:58:25.038 --> 00:58:26.272
Yeah.

1030
00:58:26.306 --> 00:58:27.674
That's a home.

1031
00:58:31.911 --> 00:58:34.781
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1032
00:58:34.814 --> 00:58:36.416
Sorry for... for what?

1033
00:58:36.449 --> 00:58:40.253
I... I haven't talked about
this in a very long time.

1034
00:58:42.322 --> 00:58:44.257
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

1035
00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:47.760
Thank you.

1036
00:58:48.194 --> 00:58:49.762
Yeah.

1037
00:58:49.796 --> 00:58:51.131
You're a good listener.

1038
00:58:53.066 --> 00:58:55.201
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1039
00:59:03.276 --> 00:59:04.687
Hey, guys,
I found something that... Ho!

1040
00:59:04.711 --> 00:59:06.646
- Nothing happened.
- Her mom died.

1041
00:59:08.014 --> 00:59:09.291
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1042
00:59:09.315 --> 00:59:12.719
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

1043
00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.755
Nice jammies, <i>guey.</i>

1044
00:59:20.293 --> 00:59:24.063
Okay.
I've gone through the files.

1045
00:59:24.097 --> 00:59:27.867
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1046
00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:30.170
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1047
00:59:30.203 --> 00:59:32.005
before it chose you, Jaime.

1048
00:59:32.038 --> 00:59:34.974
And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1049
00:59:35.008 --> 00:59:37.777
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1050
00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:40.113
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1051
00:59:40.146 --> 00:59:41.881
It didn't go up my ass.

1052
00:59:41.915 --> 00:59:44.083
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1053
00:59:44.117 --> 00:59:46.953
and that's what it's trying to do to
you, Jaime, connect to your brain.

1054
00:59:46.986 --> 00:59:48.788
It's trying to become one
with you.

1055
00:59:48.821 --> 00:59:49.989
Why?

1056
00:59:50.023 --> 00:59:51.267
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1057
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:53.026
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1058
00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:54.127
It's sentient.

1059
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.329
That's why it chooses a host.

1060
00:59:56.362 --> 00:59:59.141
That's why sometimes, it does what
you want, and sometimes, it doesn't.

1061
00:59:59.165 --> 01:00:01.134
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1062
01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:03.236
This wasn't made
on Earth, <i>cabezon.</i>

1063
01:00:03.269 --> 01:00:05.004
- No way.
<i>- Si</i> way.

1064
01:00:05.038 --> 01:00:07.106
It's alien.

1065
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.875
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1066
01:00:08.908 --> 01:00:10.920
- You can use it, but I just...
- Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1067
01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:14.480
What happened to Ted's
professor guy? How did he get it out?

1068
01:00:14.514 --> 01:00:15.782
You might want to sit down.

1069
01:00:18.284 --> 01:00:20.787
- Or not. All right...
- Rudy, please. Focus.

1070
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.388
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1071
01:00:22.422 --> 01:00:24.757
The good news is, I
figured out how to get it out.

1072
01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:26.159
Fine.

1073
01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:28.361
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1074
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:31.130
- What?
- Dead.

1075
01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:32.441
What do you mean "dead"?

1076
01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:34.100
Okay, right now, Jaime, look.

1077
01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:36.369
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1078
01:00:36.402 --> 01:00:39.939
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1079
01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:42.141
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1080
01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:44.911
It's designed
to protect its host.

1081
01:00:44.944 --> 01:00:46.446
To keep it alive.

1082
01:00:46.479 --> 01:00:48.548
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1083
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.783
No, it's not forever.

1084
01:00:50.817 --> 01:00:52.385
I mean, it's just until you...

1085
01:00:53.353 --> 01:00:55.021
until you die.

1086
01:00:55.054 --> 01:00:56.956
I think it's kinda cool.

1087
01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.226
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabron.</i>

1088
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.795
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing...

1089
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:05.498
Oh, you had no idea. So
then what are my options now?

1090
01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:08.901
So, option one is
to become an android

1091
01:01:08.935 --> 01:01:10.470
for the rest of my life.

1092
01:01:10.503 --> 01:01:12.939
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1093
01:01:12.972 --> 01:01:14.907
- billionaire psychopath?
- I'm so sorry.

1094
01:01:14.941 --> 01:01:16.276
All I wanted was a job.

1095
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:18.811
- Maybe there's a...
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1096
01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:20.346
It's all bad news.

1097
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.924
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1098
01:01:21.948 --> 01:01:23.516
I don't understand
why you can't...

1099
01:01:24.317 --> 01:01:26.886
God.

1100
01:01:26.919 --> 01:01:29.355
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1101
01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:31.224
Jaime, just...

1102
01:01:31.257 --> 01:01:33.459
Let me go talk to him. I
think I know where he's going.

1103
01:01:33.493 --> 01:01:35.928
<i>Cabezon,</i> wait up.

1104
01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:47.173
God.

1105
01:01:52.445 --> 01:01:56.015
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1106
01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:57.950
Like a cat, Jaime.

1107
01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:08.528
I'm sorry
for yelling at you, Rudy.

1108
01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.906
I shouldn't have yelled at you, but...

1109
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:14.033
It's not lost
on me that your situation

1110
01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:16.202
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1111
01:02:18.404 --> 01:02:20.473
Yeah, we're...

1112
01:02:20.506 --> 01:02:22.575
we're resilient people.

1113
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:26.412
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1114
01:02:26.446 --> 01:02:29.982
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1115
01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:34.187
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1116
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.092
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1117
01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.628
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1118
01:02:41.662 --> 01:02:43.664
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1119
01:02:43.697 --> 01:02:48.301
The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

1120
01:02:48.334 --> 01:02:52.939
But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1121
01:02:52.972 --> 01:02:55.141
Any <i>ja</i> he could
get his hands on.

1122
01:02:55.174 --> 01:02:57.611
<i>Jornalero,</i> bus boy, waiter.

1123
01:02:57.644 --> 01:03:00.980
He was a mechanic,
<i>era de todo,</i> dishwasher.

1124
01:03:03.082 --> 01:03:06.285
And to get us all
here and to keep us all together.

1125
01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:09.088
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1126
01:03:10.256 --> 01:03:12.225
That's what we come from.

1127
01:03:12.258 --> 01:03:16.028
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1128
01:03:16.062 --> 01:03:19.065
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do with it.

1129
01:03:19.098 --> 01:03:21.033
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1130
01:03:22.335 --> 01:03:25.271
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1131
01:03:26.973 --> 01:03:29.142
And not just some
foot up our ass.

1132
01:03:30.443 --> 01:03:31.487
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1133
01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:33.079
I'm just some failed promise

1134
01:03:33.112 --> 01:03:34.712
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1135
01:03:36.617 --> 01:03:37.917
Don't say that, man.

1136
01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:40.520
You're not a failed promise.

1137
01:03:40.553 --> 01:03:43.222
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1138
01:03:43.256 --> 01:03:45.158
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1139
01:03:46.192 --> 01:03:49.962
And... and I love you.

1140
01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:52.633
And I love you, too, <i>cabezon.</i>
Yeah, all right.

1141
01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:54.567
Guys?

1142
01:03:56.436 --> 01:03:57.937
Do you hear that?

1143
01:03:59.338 --> 01:04:00.440
That's Victoria.

1144
01:04:06.112 --> 01:04:07.313
Where are they going?

1145
01:04:09.582 --> 01:04:11.017
Home.

1146
01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:14.520
You're wasting too much water.

1147
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.300
It's always my fault.

1148
01:04:29.035 --> 01:04:30.169
Yeah.

1149
01:04:40.631 --> 01:04:41.673
Something wrong?

1150
01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:56.462
Guys?

1151
01:04:58.364 --> 01:05:00.099
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1152
01:05:09.308 --> 01:05:11.577
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up.</i>

1153
01:05:11.612 --> 01:05:13.246
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

1154
01:05:13.279 --> 01:05:16.249
<i>We are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

1155
01:05:16.282 --> 01:05:18.551
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up...</i>

1156
01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:20.337
Get away from the windows!

1157
01:05:20.353 --> 01:05:22.388
<i>We are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

1158
01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:24.257
Okay. Okay.

1159
01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:25.826
Um...

1160
01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:28.294
I'm gonna fly. I'm gonna fly.

1161
01:05:28.327 --> 01:05:29.395
Let's do this.

1162
01:05:31.732 --> 01:05:32.766
Yeah!

1163
01:05:35.368 --> 01:05:37.103
Yeah, no chance.

1164
01:05:39.472 --> 01:05:40.506
Now!

1165
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.843
- Ay!
- Dude, no worries.

1166
01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.745
- Just take your time.
- Thanks, Jenny.

1167
01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:47.079
- You gotta force it to come out.
- What do you...

1168
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:52.184
Oh. Oh.

1169
01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:56.522
- You're a genius.
- I know. What'd I say?

1170
01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:58.100
You said this thing's
gonna protect me, right?

1171
01:05:58.124 --> 01:05:59.434
- I...
- It's not gonna let me die?

1172
01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:01.494
No, no. I mean, when you die...

1173
01:06:01.527 --> 01:06:03.105
- All right, let's see if it works.
- I wouldn't test it.

1174
01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:04.969
- No, no, no, Jaime!
- Wait, wait, wait, Jaime!

1175
01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:26.218
Well, back to the Tacoma,
I guess.

1176
01:06:26.252 --> 01:06:27.253
Yeah.

1177
01:06:34.594 --> 01:06:36.204
<i>We have the Reyes
house surrounded. The family's inside.</i>

1178
01:06:36.228 --> 01:06:37.788
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1179
01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:39.866
Round them up!

1180
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.334
Breach team, go.

1181
01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:43.169
On me.

1182
01:06:46.372 --> 01:06:47.406
We're in!

1183
01:06:48.942 --> 01:06:51.344
Fan out. Flash!

1184
01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:53.747
Clear!

1185
01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.616
- Get the light on.
- I got your left!

1186
01:06:57.383 --> 01:06:58.383
Back room, clear!

1187
01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:01.287
Clear!

1188
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.456
Hands
on your head. Don't move.

1189
01:07:03.489 --> 01:07:04.801
- Okay, okay.
- Don't move!

1190
01:07:04.825 --> 01:07:06.258
- Don't touch my family!
- Get up!

1191
01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:08.194
Let's go! Up, up!

1192
01:07:08.227 --> 01:07:09.896
Hands up! Watch your two!

1193
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.298
Miss Kord, we found the family.

1194
01:07:14.901 --> 01:07:16.946
We got 'em coming
out. Take 'em out.

1195
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.705
Let's go.

1196
01:07:18.739 --> 01:07:20.617
Drag them out!

1197
01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:23.886
Come on! Let's go, come on!

1198
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.879
- Let her go!
- Move, move!

1199
01:07:28.547 --> 01:07:29.959
Let's go, let's go!

1200
01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:36.657
Let's go!

1201
01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.692
Do not resist!

1202
01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:42.495
No! No! No!

1203
01:07:46.767 --> 01:07:48.911
Get
on the ground. On the ground!

1204
01:07:48.935 --> 01:07:51.672
Get down, now!
Let's go, now!

1205
01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.676
The kid's not there.

1206
01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:57.911
Find him!

1207
01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:00.714
Is he inside?

1208
01:08:00.831 --> 01:08:01.999
Don't say anything.

1209
01:08:02.015 --> 01:08:03.015
Where is he?

1210
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:06.218
Where is he?

1211
01:08:06.252 --> 01:08:08.320
Where is he?

1212
01:08:12.324 --> 01:08:14.226
I could use
that arsenal right about now.

1213
01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.996
<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

1214
01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:17.196
Hell yeah!

1215
01:08:24.537 --> 01:08:26.907
Nice work, Khaji.
You guys okay?

1216
01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.508
- Jaime?
- Sorry, I'm late, Mom.

1217
01:08:29.542 --> 01:08:30.911
Magnificent.

1218
01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:32.545
Wait, what?

1219
01:08:32.578 --> 01:08:34.014
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1220
01:08:34.047 --> 01:08:36.650
Look, don't shoot.
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

1221
01:08:36.683 --> 01:08:38.551
<i>Fire!</i>

1222
01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:40.821
God damn it!
I said don't shoot.

1223
01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:46.927
Oh, my God. I'm bulletproof.

1224
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.695
Let's see what you can do.

1225
01:08:49.528 --> 01:08:51.631
Target the family.

1226
01:08:51.665 --> 01:08:53.900
<i>- Engage.</i>
- Take 'em out.

1227
01:08:55.969 --> 01:08:58.404
I got you guys.
Don't worry.

1228
01:08:58.437 --> 01:08:59.505
It's gonna be okay.

1229
01:09:01.574 --> 01:09:03.309
Okay, let's see what you got.

1230
01:09:03.342 --> 01:09:04.553
<i>Eliminating threats.</i>

1231
01:09:04.577 --> 01:09:06.445
What? No, Khaji, no killing.

1232
01:09:07.748 --> 01:09:09.750
Yeah, that's more like it.

1233
01:09:19.025 --> 01:09:19.960
Get out of here.

1234
01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:21.327
Run!

1235
01:09:22.629 --> 01:09:24.430
<i>Analyzing threat level.</i>

1236
01:09:24.463 --> 01:09:25.799
Okay. Let's do this.

1237
01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:37.343
Hell yeah!

1238
01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:39.856
Down on the ground!

1239
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.715
- <i>Papi!</i>
- Mili!

1240
01:09:41.748 --> 01:09:43.617
We got one.

1241
01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:44.643
Hide!

1242
01:09:45.417 --> 01:09:46.929
Stay down. Don't move.

1243
01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.021
Stay where you are.

1244
01:09:50.056 --> 01:09:50.757
- No!
<i>- We got another one.</i>

1245
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:51.858
Dad!

1246
01:09:53.526 --> 01:09:54.795
Come to papa.

1247
01:09:59.465 --> 01:10:00.834
Carapax, ready the claw.

1248
01:10:10.476 --> 01:10:12.879
Daddy, I'm scared.

1249
01:10:12.913 --> 01:10:15.816
Everything is gonna be okay.

1250
01:10:15.849 --> 01:10:17.851
<i>- Jaime, your family.</i>
- Stay down!

1251
01:10:21.721 --> 01:10:23.790
Okay, come on, <i>Papi.</i>

1252
01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:26.693
Mili, get Dad outta here. Go!

1253
01:10:26.726 --> 01:10:28.662
- Go!
- Okay. Okay, let's go.

1254
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.398
Ready.

1255
01:10:34.734 --> 01:10:37.570
<i>They have a weapon.
I suggest we retreat.</i>

1256
01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:40.941
No way. They attack my family,
we're gonna finish this.

1257
01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.542
And...

1258
01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.014
Dad.

1259
01:10:48.048 --> 01:10:50.516
Dad, no. Dad, what's wrong?

1260
01:10:50.549 --> 01:10:51.885
Dad! Dad!

1261
01:10:51.918 --> 01:10:54.888
No, no, no! Dad!

1262
01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:56.522
No!

1263
01:10:56.555 --> 01:10:58.024
No, no, no.

1264
01:10:58.058 --> 01:10:59.926
- Dad!
- No!

1265
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960
Now!

1266
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.032
Now, what's happening?

1267
01:11:06.066 --> 01:11:09.602
- <i>Symbiotic systems...</i>
- Khaji, do something!

1268
01:11:12.739 --> 01:11:16.042
Dad, no!

1269
01:11:16.076 --> 01:11:18.645
Dad! <i>Apa!</i>

1270
01:11:18.678 --> 01:11:20.113
<i>- Apa!</i>
- Jaime!

1271
01:11:25.185 --> 01:11:28.554
No. No, no, no.

1272
01:11:28.587 --> 01:11:29.623
No.

1273
01:11:29.656 --> 01:11:31.423
No, Jaime.

1274
01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:33.760
Jaime, watch out!

1275
01:11:33.793 --> 01:11:36.763
You! You!

1276
01:11:36.796 --> 01:11:38.665
What do you want with us?

1277
01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:42.636
- Dad, no!
- What are you doing?

1278
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:45.071
Get this thing off of me,
you psycho!

1279
01:11:45.906 --> 01:11:48.909
Mom!

1280
01:11:48.942 --> 01:11:51.577
<i>- Mami!</i>
- Mili!

1281
01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:53.980
Alberto!

1282
01:11:54.014 --> 01:11:55.115
Alberto.

1283
01:11:55.148 --> 01:11:57.117
Let me go!

1284
01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:59.653
- Khaji, do something!
- I got him. Let's go.

1285
01:12:00.519 --> 01:12:02.722
<i>Apa!</i>

1286
01:12:22.976 --> 01:12:24.921
- Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.
- Wake up.

1287
01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.617
<i>Apa!</i>

1288
01:12:32.218 --> 01:12:34.888
I'm gonna come...
I'm gonna come get you.

1289
01:12:46.032 --> 01:12:47.233
Call an ambulance.

1290
01:13:07.087 --> 01:13:08.955
Clear!

1291
01:13:10.757 --> 01:13:12.491
Clear! Clear!

1292
01:13:54.476 --> 01:13:56.395
We have to help Jaime.

1293
01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:57.871
Mm?

1294
01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:02.484
We don't have time for self-pity.

1295
01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.695
We must rescue Jaime.

1296
01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:07.322
That's what his father would have wanted.

1297
01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.297
Listen...

1298
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:26.717
I know how you feel

1299
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.719
but we have to be brave.

1300
01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:31.138
There will be a time to cry.

1301
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.266
This is not that time.

1302
01:14:36.894 --> 01:14:38.812
We have turned both cheeks.

1303
01:14:38.896 --> 01:14:41.280
Now is the time to fight.

1304
01:14:43.683 --> 01:14:46.162
Nana is right,
Mili. We have to go and save Jaime.

1305
01:14:46.186 --> 01:14:50.623
How? Okay, we don't even
know where they took him.

1306
01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:52.158
I might know where he is.

1307
01:14:56.196 --> 01:14:57.230
Please.

1308
01:14:58.198 --> 01:14:59.265
Come with me.

1309
01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:02.936
I can help.

1310
01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.241
Watch your step.

1311
01:15:29.462 --> 01:15:30.964
All right.

1312
01:15:30.997 --> 01:15:32.232
Let's do this.

1313
01:15:36.269 --> 01:15:38.171
Let's go.

1314
01:15:38.204 --> 01:15:40.006
Okay, okay.

1315
01:15:40.039 --> 01:15:41.241
I'm done, I'm done.

1316
01:15:43.476 --> 01:15:45.178
Okay, guys.

1317
01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:46.813
Let's hope this Kord tech works.

1318
01:15:53.153 --> 01:15:55.288
Hang on.

1319
01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:58.424
Okay...

1320
01:16:00.393 --> 01:16:02.328
Dude!

1321
01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:15.050
- There.
<i>- Welcome back to the Bug Ship, Teddy.</i>

1322
01:16:15.074 --> 01:16:16.109
Oh, that's sexy.

1323
01:16:16.142 --> 01:16:17.443
Look at you.

1324
01:16:17.477 --> 01:16:19.077
- This is sick.
- Thrusters!

1325
01:16:26.452 --> 01:16:28.097
- Let's go get our boy.
- Let's do this.

1326
01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:29.121
Jenny.

1327
01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:36.863
Okay. Good, good,
good. Good.

1328
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:47.473
So, what's
the plan when we get there?

1329
01:16:47.507 --> 01:16:49.242
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

1330
01:16:49.275 --> 01:16:50.944
That's not how you say...

1331
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.256
<i>Ama,</i> I'm flying!

1332
01:17:03.289 --> 01:17:04.757
Whoo!

1333
01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:12.031
After 15 years,
everything we've done,

1334
01:17:12.065 --> 01:17:14.200
every sacrifice we've made,

1335
01:17:14.234 --> 01:17:17.103
has led to this moment.

1336
01:17:17.136 --> 01:17:21.207
Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

1337
01:17:21.241 --> 01:17:23.009
Almost there.

1338
01:17:23.042 --> 01:17:25.845
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1339
01:17:25.878 --> 01:17:27.280
Are you ready?

1340
01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:28.448
I'm ready.

1341
01:17:35.355 --> 01:17:37.232
This will make you feel better.

1342
01:17:37.233 --> 01:17:38.925
Is this thing bulletproof?

1343
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.207
We'll need more than a flying bug
to save Jaime.

1344
01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:52.005
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1345
01:17:56.242 --> 01:17:59.078
Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

1346
01:17:59.112 --> 01:18:02.081
Oh, no, no. That's
not what you think it is.

1347
01:18:02.115 --> 01:18:04.951
It's just a special prototype

1348
01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:08.054
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1349
01:18:08.087 --> 01:18:09.589
Do these things work?

1350
01:18:09.623 --> 01:18:11.958
Mm... some of them.

1351
01:18:13.126 --> 01:18:14.193
Sometimes.

1352
01:18:15.428 --> 01:18:17.397
Whoa.

1353
01:18:19.399 --> 01:18:21.167
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1354
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.036
Try pressing another button.

1355
01:18:29.909 --> 01:18:32.845
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1356
01:18:36.449 --> 01:18:39.385
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

1357
01:18:39.419 --> 01:18:40.920
how to use these things?

1358
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:45.191
Nana?

1359
01:18:45.224 --> 01:18:48.161
Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1360
01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:54.359
There's plenty you don't know
about your Nana.

1361
01:18:59.505 --> 01:19:01.541
This is where they took Jaime.

1362
01:19:01.574 --> 01:19:05.011
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1363
01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:08.047
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

1364
01:19:08.081 --> 01:19:10.083
The place is a fortress.

1365
01:19:10.116 --> 01:19:11.876
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1366
01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:14.480
I've stormed this kind of fortress before.

1367
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.922
What the hell?

1368
01:19:15.955 --> 01:19:17.166
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

1369
01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:18.625
about Nana's revolutionary past.

1370
01:19:18.659 --> 01:19:19.659
Her what?

1371
01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:21.845
Let me see that tunnel.

1372
01:19:25.825 --> 01:19:27.165
That's how we get in.

1373
01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:31.813
We will create a diversion

1374
01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.233
while they go in

1375
01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:36.360
directly to the basement.

1376
01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:37.953
Yeah, the generators are here.

1377
01:19:37.977 --> 01:19:39.221
- Mm.
- We could blow them up

1378
01:19:39.245 --> 01:19:41.280
and knock power out.

1379
01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:45.619
After that, you go and find Jaime.

1380
01:19:45.702 --> 01:19:48.205
We'll be the getaway.

1381
01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:49.955
Any questions?

1382
01:19:49.956 --> 01:19:51.658
Hm?

1383
01:19:51.692 --> 01:19:54.227
Damn, Nana.

1384
01:20:16.482 --> 01:20:17.482
Hey, who are you?

1385
01:20:19.285 --> 01:20:21.454
What're you doing? Get
me out of this thing, please?

1386
01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:23.624
Is there a problem, Sanchez?

1387
01:20:23.657 --> 01:20:25.358
I'm sorry.

1388
01:20:25.391 --> 01:20:27.493
You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1389
01:20:27.527 --> 01:20:28.961
Tell her to get me out of this!

1390
01:20:31.765 --> 01:20:34.000
It's okay. It's okay.

1391
01:20:34.033 --> 01:20:36.670
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1392
01:20:36.703 --> 01:20:40.273
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

1393
01:20:40.306 --> 01:20:45.445
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1394
01:20:45.478 --> 01:20:47.513
But now that you've
activated it,

1395
01:20:47.547 --> 01:20:51.317
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

1396
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:52.629
What are you even talking about?

1397
01:20:52.653 --> 01:20:55.121
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

1398
01:20:55.154 --> 01:20:56.989
Oh, bummer.

1399
01:20:57.023 --> 01:21:00.426
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1400
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.063
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1401
01:21:04.096 --> 01:21:05.666
Do it, Sanchez.

1402
01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:07.644
With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

1403
01:21:07.668 --> 01:21:10.069
Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

1404
01:21:13.406 --> 01:21:15.441
Damn it.

1405
01:21:28.789 --> 01:21:30.256
Bug.

1406
01:21:30.289 --> 01:21:32.124
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1407
01:21:35.495 --> 01:21:36.695
You're going too fast!

1408
01:21:38.231 --> 01:21:39.465
Here goes nothing.

1409
01:21:41.635 --> 01:21:44.103
Hold on, hold on!

1410
01:21:45.471 --> 01:21:48.140
All right. All right.

1411
01:21:49.308 --> 01:21:51.812
Incoming!

1412
01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:53.179
Brace for impact!

1413
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.462
Let's go, let's go!

1414
01:22:09.495 --> 01:22:11.798
On the wall! Engage. Engage.

1415
01:22:16.803 --> 01:22:18.538
Rudy, do something.

1416
01:22:18.571 --> 01:22:20.540
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1417
01:22:33.586 --> 01:22:34.721
Here we go!

1418
01:22:39.726 --> 01:22:40.870
Whoa.

1419
01:22:40.894 --> 01:22:42.161
Okay, okay.

1420
01:22:57.911 --> 01:23:00.151
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1421
01:23:05.251 --> 01:23:07.851
- It's like I can't miss.
- Right there, right there.

1422
01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:13.075
I stepped on him!

1423
01:23:13.459 --> 01:23:15.339
- Twenty points!
- Whoo-hoo!

1424
01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.675
Activating cloaking system.

1425
01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:32.411
<i>Activating bug fart.</i>

1426
01:23:40.453 --> 01:23:41.622
Take that!

1427
01:23:42.455 --> 01:23:44.457
Whoo!

1428
01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:16.589
- Yeah, this way.
- Okay.

1429
01:24:16.623 --> 01:24:18.224
Hey! Come on.

1430
01:24:19.492 --> 01:24:20.961
I know you can hear me.

1431
01:24:24.397 --> 01:24:25.699
Just let me out!

1432
01:24:36.542 --> 01:24:38.177
I'll keep it safe.

1433
01:24:38.879 --> 01:24:40.379
Start the transfer.

1434
01:24:40.413 --> 01:24:42.581
And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

1435
01:24:43.516 --> 01:24:44.818
Get me out of here!

1436
01:24:44.851 --> 01:24:46.328
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1437
01:24:46.352 --> 01:24:47.921
from his connection
to the Scarab...

1438
01:24:47.954 --> 01:24:49.231
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1439
01:24:49.255 --> 01:24:52.191
Let me out! No! No!

1440
01:25:10.276 --> 01:25:11.978
Milagro, here, hide!

1441
01:25:22.455 --> 01:25:23.522
Holy shit.

1442
01:25:24.624 --> 01:25:25.892
Okay, I think we're good.

1443
01:25:27.928 --> 01:25:28.929
What the...

1444
01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:38.705
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1445
01:25:38.739 --> 01:25:40.774
What the hell is this?

1446
01:25:40.807 --> 01:25:43.275
Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

1447
01:25:43.309 --> 01:25:45.244
Enough to build an entire army.

1448
01:25:59.659 --> 01:26:01.436
Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

1449
01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.696
What's going on?

1450
01:26:02.729 --> 01:26:04.430
Oh, no.
The Scarab download

1451
01:26:04.463 --> 01:26:06.042
is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

1452
01:26:06.066 --> 01:26:07.701
What does it mean?

1453
01:26:07.734 --> 01:26:09.803
The transfer is killing him.

1454
01:26:09.836 --> 01:26:12.505
He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

1455
01:26:12.538 --> 01:26:13.740
His pulse is dropping.

1456
01:26:13.774 --> 01:26:15.541
Well, just fix it!

1457
01:26:37.063 --> 01:26:39.032
Hey, <i>flaco.</i>

1458
01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:51.377
Dad.

1459
01:26:54.547 --> 01:26:55.715
What's going on?

1460
01:26:59.753 --> 01:27:01.420
What are you doing here?

1461
01:27:05.424 --> 01:27:06.425
You know.

1462
01:27:08.094 --> 01:27:10.529
No. <i>Apa.</i>

1463
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:16.195
Everything is going to be okay.

1464
01:27:23.777 --> 01:27:27.379
Milagro, here.
Help me with these.

1465
01:27:51.872 --> 01:27:52.939
Jaime.

1466
01:27:55.909 --> 01:27:58.178
This is not your time.

1467
01:27:58.211 --> 01:27:59.646
You have to go back.

1468
01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:01.782
Come with me.

1469
01:28:02.481 --> 01:28:03.950
Please.

1470
01:28:03.984 --> 01:28:06.385
I understand everything now.

1471
01:28:07.654 --> 01:28:10.857
My destiny was
to be here with you.

1472
01:28:10.891 --> 01:28:12.524
In this moment.

1473
01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:15.695
To help you cross into it.

1474
01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:19.800
The universe knows it's you.

1475
01:28:20.092 --> 01:28:22.678
I know it's you.

1476
01:28:22.761 --> 01:28:24.555
You know it as well.

1477
01:28:25.772 --> 01:28:27.473
This is your purpose.

1478
01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:58.547
The scarab has chosen you for a reason.

1479
01:28:59.105 --> 01:29:02.441
<i>It's time for you
to accept your destiny, Jaime.</i>

1480
01:29:16.756 --> 01:29:18.758
How am I gonna
do this without you?

1481
01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:22.529
I'll always be with you.

1482
01:29:23.196 --> 01:29:25.699
How am I gonna know what to do?

1483
01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:29.036
All the answers are here.

1484
01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:40.964
I love you, son.

1485
01:29:42.816 --> 01:29:44.583
I love you, too, <i>Papi.</i>

1486
01:30:04.304 --> 01:30:05.705
Something's happening.

1487
01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.108
What?

1488
01:30:08.141 --> 01:30:10.152
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1489
01:30:10.176 --> 01:30:11.945
Right there.
They're connecting.

1490
01:30:17.217 --> 01:30:19.085
I need you, Khaji!

1491
01:30:22.088 --> 01:30:23.823
They're becoming one.

1492
01:30:35.168 --> 01:30:36.278
We've got the code?

1493
01:30:36.302 --> 01:30:37.579
The transfer's complete.

1494
01:30:37.603 --> 01:30:38.805
The code is ours.

1495
01:30:38.838 --> 01:30:40.140
It's working!

1496
01:30:56.256 --> 01:30:57.690
Oh, no.

1497
01:30:59.659 --> 01:31:00.894
Go, go, go!

1498
01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:20.947
Okay. Here we go.

1499
01:31:40.033 --> 01:31:41.600
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1500
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:00.186
No. No, no, no.

1501
01:32:02.722 --> 01:32:04.424
Sanchez, stop him!

1502
01:32:04.457 --> 01:32:05.925
Oh, shit.

1503
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.038
What?

1504
01:32:19.072 --> 01:32:21.207
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1505
01:32:21.241 --> 01:32:22.818
- Wait, wait, wait. My family?
- Quickly!

1506
01:32:22.842 --> 01:32:24.644
What do you mean my family?

1507
01:32:25.345 --> 01:32:26.880
Go!

1508
01:32:26.913 --> 01:32:29.115
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1509
01:32:30.717 --> 01:32:33.820
My name is not Sanchez, <i>pendeja!</i>

1510
01:32:33.853 --> 01:32:37.657
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1511
01:32:40.393 --> 01:32:42.862
What are you doing?

1512
01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:45.899
Stop him, Carapax.

1513
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.136
Go. I'll be fine.

1514
01:32:53.773 --> 01:32:55.208
Okay, Khaji, come on.

1515
01:32:57.076 --> 01:32:59.212
Okay.
All right, Khaji, activate!

1516
01:32:59.245 --> 01:33:00.446
<i>Rebooting.</i>

1517
01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:03.016
Rebooting? Are you kidding me?

1518
01:33:05.018 --> 01:33:07.387
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1519
01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:16.429
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1520
01:33:19.399 --> 01:33:21.901
Milagro, wait.

1521
01:33:21.935 --> 01:33:23.379
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

1522
01:33:23.403 --> 01:33:25.283
No, no, watch out!

1523
01:33:33.146 --> 01:33:34.180
Jenny.

1524
01:33:35.315 --> 01:33:36.416
Jenny?

1525
01:33:38.318 --> 01:33:39.452
Jenny!

1526
01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:49.829
Finally, I can feel it.

1527
01:33:56.569 --> 01:33:59.138
Oh...

1528
01:33:59.172 --> 01:34:04.177
Now this look really suits you.

1529
01:34:07.914 --> 01:34:10.183
Okay.

1530
01:34:10.216 --> 01:34:12.518
Okay, Khaji.
All right, Khaji-Da.

1531
01:34:12.552 --> 01:34:14.554
You got this. You can do this.

1532
01:34:14.587 --> 01:34:17.357
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1533
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:19.168
<i>Still rebooting.</i>

1534
01:34:19.192 --> 01:34:20.393
Come on!

1535
01:34:37.844 --> 01:34:38.844
Freeze!

1536
01:34:40.614 --> 01:34:42.815
Stay right there!

1537
01:34:43.549 --> 01:34:44.984
Come on.

1538
01:34:45.018 --> 01:34:46.128
Don't move.

1539
01:34:48.254 --> 01:34:49.322
Take him down.

1540
01:35:02.035 --> 01:35:03.069
Nana?

1541
01:35:05.205 --> 01:35:06.538
Come on.

1542
01:35:06.539 --> 01:35:08.308
Okay.

1543
01:35:08.341 --> 01:35:10.176
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1544
01:35:11.295 --> 01:35:12.295
I'll tell you later.

1545
01:35:31.264 --> 01:35:32.544
Keep your eyes peeled.

1546
01:35:40.032 --> 01:35:42.159
Down with the imperialists!

1547
01:35:53.212 --> 01:35:54.505
Now we can go.

1548
01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:19.245
Milagro!

1549
01:36:25.719 --> 01:36:28.154
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

1550
01:36:28.187 --> 01:36:31.991
What a mess you have made.

1551
01:36:32.024 --> 01:36:34.193
Let's go.
On your feet. Get up!

1552
01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.601
<i>Ama.</i>

1553
01:36:46.723 --> 01:36:47.724
You ok?

1554
01:36:48.207 --> 01:36:49.418
Yeah.

1555
01:36:49.442 --> 01:36:51.544
Sheez.

1556
01:36:51.577 --> 01:36:53.413
- Milagro.
- Where is she?

1557
01:36:53.446 --> 01:36:54.981
Milagro and Jenny.
They're in there.

1558
01:36:55.014 --> 01:36:56.358
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1559
01:36:56.382 --> 01:36:58.117
Okay, I need to head
back in there, okay?

1560
01:36:58.151 --> 01:36:59.653
Yeah.
What about the suit?

1561
01:36:59.686 --> 01:37:00.697
It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

1562
01:37:00.721 --> 01:37:02.255
- Jaime.
- Yes?

1563
01:37:02.288 --> 01:37:04.991
Okay.

1564
01:37:05.024 --> 01:37:07.728
Uh... Rudy, what's
that <i>chongo</i> thing called again?

1565
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:09.328
Khaji-Da.

1566
01:37:09.362 --> 01:37:11.197
Right.

1567
01:37:11.230 --> 01:37:13.199
I know you can hear me,
Khaji-Da.

1568
01:37:14.534 --> 01:37:17.136
I want you both
to get it together.

1569
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:19.238
Find your strength, <i>mijito.</i>

1570
01:37:19.272 --> 01:37:23.610
Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

1571
01:37:23.644 --> 01:37:25.978
I want you
to go back in there...

1572
01:37:27.097 --> 01:37:30.475
And kick their asses!

1573
01:37:34.086 --> 01:37:35.406
I found one of them.

1574
01:37:42.796 --> 01:37:44.397
Sick.

1575
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:46.633
- Drop your weapon.
- Oh, goddamn it.

1576
01:37:57.376 --> 01:37:59.078
Hey! <i>Pendejos!</i>

1577
01:38:11.725 --> 01:38:13.426
<i>Rebooting complete.</i>

1578
01:38:13.459 --> 01:38:15.361
Get the hell away
from my sister.

1579
01:38:15.394 --> 01:38:16.630
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

1580
01:38:17.764 --> 01:38:18.953
You ready Khaji?

1581
01:38:18.954 --> 01:38:20.734
Let's kick their ass.

1582
01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.536
Come on, let's get it.

1583
01:38:23.569 --> 01:38:25.204
Who's first?

1584
01:38:32.144 --> 01:38:33.446
Oh, you want some?

1585
01:38:41.287 --> 01:38:42.488
Wait, wait, wait! Watch out!

1586
01:38:42.522 --> 01:38:43.624
Engage the target.

1587
01:38:49.595 --> 01:38:51.732
Let's go!

1588
01:39:01.842 --> 01:39:03.409
Oh, man, there's more.

1589
01:39:17.858 --> 01:39:18.858
Grab him!

1590
01:39:20.259 --> 01:39:22.361
What the hell?
Get 'em off of me!

1591
01:39:22.395 --> 01:39:23.396
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1592
01:39:25.799 --> 01:39:27.668
- Thanks, Khaji.
- De nada.

1593
01:39:28.301 --> 01:39:29.803
Halt!

1594
01:39:29.836 --> 01:39:32.271
<i>One more left.</i>

1595
01:39:32.305 --> 01:39:34.708
Get over here!

1596
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:45.351
Come on.

1597
01:39:45.384 --> 01:39:47.253
Come on.

1598
01:39:47.286 --> 01:39:48.286
Nice slap.

1599
01:39:52.201 --> 01:39:53.785
Where were you?

1600
01:39:55.227 --> 01:39:56.707
Okay, I deserve that one.

1601
01:39:58.665 --> 01:40:00.533
I thought
I'd never see you again.

1602
01:40:03.904 --> 01:40:05.739
I told you I wasn't
going anywhere.

1603
01:40:05.772 --> 01:40:07.617
- Well, you did.
- Yeah, that wasn't my...

1604
01:40:09.710 --> 01:40:11.678
Rudy! Rudy!

1605
01:40:11.712 --> 01:40:13.546
Mili, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1606
01:40:13.579 --> 01:40:14.657
You're safe.
I thought I lost you.

1607
01:40:14.681 --> 01:40:16.650
No, no. Look.

1608
01:40:16.683 --> 01:40:18.619
Hey, hey, hey.

1609
01:40:18.652 --> 01:40:20.353
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Jenny?

1610
01:40:20.386 --> 01:40:22.355
We got separated. I don't know.

1611
01:40:22.388 --> 01:40:24.366
Okay, we have to find her.

1612
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:25.434
Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do because I...

1613
01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:26.525
Watch out!

1614
01:40:31.197 --> 01:40:32.431
What the hell was that?

1615
01:40:34.266 --> 01:40:35.769
<i>O.M.A.C. incoming, Jaime.</i>

1616
01:40:35.802 --> 01:40:37.370
Ah, crap.

1617
01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:45.646
Get off!

1618
01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:47.513
Okay, let's do this, Khaji!

1619
01:40:47.546 --> 01:40:48.658
Give me rockets or something.

1620
01:40:48.682 --> 01:40:50.149
<i>Deploying blasters.</i>

1621
01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:54.755
Okay, now give me blades.

1622
01:40:54.788 --> 01:40:56.690
Okay, now give me...

1623
01:40:59.592 --> 01:41:01.394
<i>Careful,
he's stronger than before.</i>

1624
01:41:01.427 --> 01:41:02.696
Okay, I get it.

1625
01:41:06.733 --> 01:41:07.977
Okay, which way do we go?

1626
01:41:08.001 --> 01:41:09.803
Go to the Bug Ship.
It's that way.

1627
01:41:09.836 --> 01:41:11.996
- But where are you going?
- I'm gonna get <i>Cabezon.</i> Go!

1628
01:41:23.549 --> 01:41:24.918
<i>Critical wing damage.</i>

1629
01:41:24.951 --> 01:41:27.219
Scratch my back?
Well, I'll scratch yours.

1630
01:41:35.729 --> 01:41:36.763
All right, big boy.

1631
01:41:43.502 --> 01:41:45.271
You do not deserve this power!

1632
01:41:51.812 --> 01:41:53.252
I thought you'd
hit harder than that.

1633
01:41:56.783 --> 01:41:58.885
Okay, we need
something else, Khaji.

1634
01:41:58.919 --> 01:42:01.021
<i>Accessing energy reactor.</i>

1635
01:42:02.421 --> 01:42:03.724
There we go.

1636
01:42:10.897 --> 01:42:12.733
All right, you wanna dance, huh?

1637
01:42:12.766 --> 01:42:14.266
Now, give me a sword.

1638
01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:18.972
So I can make whatever
weapons I want, huh?

1639
01:42:19.005 --> 01:42:22.308
<i>Whatever
you can imagine, I can create.</i>

1640
01:42:22.341 --> 01:42:23.341
Let's party.

1641
01:42:29.883 --> 01:42:31.383
<i>Nice choice.</i>

1642
01:42:31.417 --> 01:42:32.417
Let's go!

1643
01:42:34.553 --> 01:42:36.790
Home run! Whoo!

1644
01:42:47.901 --> 01:42:49.468
Oh, yeah!

1645
01:42:51.004 --> 01:42:52.906
Come on.
That's all you got?

1646
01:42:52.939 --> 01:42:55.041
<i>Let's not
get ahead of ourselves, Jaime.</i>

1647
01:42:55.075 --> 01:42:56.843
Khaji, don't worry.
We got this.

1648
01:43:10.389 --> 01:43:12.558
Okay, this is a little
harder than I thought.

1649
01:43:17.764 --> 01:43:19.733
<i>Regenerative systems critical.</i>

1650
01:43:19.766 --> 01:43:21.400
What the hell?

1651
01:43:21.433 --> 01:43:23.003
There can only be one of us.

1652
01:43:23.036 --> 01:43:25.105
Khaji, do something!

1653
01:43:30.476 --> 01:43:31.912
What's wrong?
Can't breathe?

1654
01:43:51.765 --> 01:43:54.100
<i>Jaime,
I cannot protect you anymore.</i>

1655
01:43:55.702 --> 01:43:57.003
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1656
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:03.844
Khaji, Khaji, stay with me.

1657
01:44:03.877 --> 01:44:05.912
You are still
a scared little boy.

1658
01:44:20.861 --> 01:44:22.662
I told you,

1659
01:44:22.696 --> 01:44:24.931
the love you feel
for your family...

1660
01:44:24.965 --> 01:44:26.432
makes you weak.

1661
01:44:30.704 --> 01:44:32.005
Hey!

1662
01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:33.398
Take these!

1663
01:44:35.141 --> 01:44:36.719
Come on!
Come and get me.

1664
01:44:36.743 --> 01:44:38.510
Come on!

1665
01:44:40.046 --> 01:44:41.046
Rudy.

1666
01:44:42.148 --> 01:44:43.817
Oh, shit.

1667
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:44.850
No!

1668
01:44:45.852 --> 01:44:47.654
Rudy!

1669
01:45:04.938 --> 01:45:08.675
Khaji-Da!

1670
01:45:20.486 --> 01:45:22.789
Your O.M.A.C. has failed.

1671
01:45:22.822 --> 01:45:25.225
Jennifer, you don't know
what the O.M.A.C. is.

1672
01:45:25.258 --> 01:45:27.559
Carapax is just a prototype.

1673
01:45:27.593 --> 01:45:29.561
This is the only thing
that's important.

1674
01:45:29.595 --> 01:45:30.997
The Scarab code.

1675
01:45:31.031 --> 01:45:34.533
With this, I can make
a thousand Carapaxes.

1676
01:45:34.566 --> 01:45:36.970
This is the culmination
of my life's work.

1677
01:45:37.003 --> 01:45:42.709
This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

1678
01:45:42.742 --> 01:45:46.079
Not mine. I'll make sure of it.

1679
01:45:46.112 --> 01:45:51.483
You're... you're gonna side
with that Edge Key trash

1680
01:45:51.517 --> 01:45:53.485
over your own family?

1681
01:45:55.554 --> 01:45:57.556
That Edge Key trash...

1682
01:45:57.589 --> 01:46:01.795
knows more about
family than you ever will.

1683
01:46:01.828 --> 01:46:04.197
I know. No, I know
about family.

1684
01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:08.268
I know about my family
that overlooked me,

1685
01:46:08.301 --> 01:46:09.970
just the way that you are now,

1686
01:46:10.003 --> 01:46:12.672
because you are
just like your pathetic father,

1687
01:46:12.706 --> 01:46:15.675
who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1688
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:17.644
for the greater good.

1689
01:46:17.677 --> 01:46:21.715
I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

1690
01:46:21.757 --> 01:46:23.050
Me too.

1691
01:46:26.052 --> 01:46:27.553
Oh!

1692
01:46:54.247 --> 01:46:56.116
No! We're not done!

1693
01:47:02.789 --> 01:47:05.992
<i>Jaime, threat disarmed.</i>

1694
01:47:06.026 --> 01:47:07.927
<i>You're losing control.</i>

1695
01:47:07.961 --> 01:47:10.562
You think
that you could beat me? Huh?

1696
01:47:10.596 --> 01:47:13.066
You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

1697
01:47:16.703 --> 01:47:20.673
<i>O.M.A.C. neutralized.
Recommend to disengage.</i>

1698
01:47:28.148 --> 01:47:29.983
What are you doing?

1699
01:47:30.016 --> 01:47:32.819
<i>We are not killers, Jaime.</i>

1700
01:47:32.852 --> 01:47:34.687
<i>Let him go.</i>

1701
01:47:34.721 --> 01:47:36.122
What about Dad?

1702
01:47:37.657 --> 01:47:40.093
What about Rudy?

1703
01:47:40.126 --> 01:47:44.197
<i>During the transfer,
I unlocked his memories.</i>

1704
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:45.865
<i>Let me show you.</i>

1705
01:47:50.036 --> 01:47:52.105
What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

1706
01:47:52.138 --> 01:47:53.840
Then we'll just get another one.

1707
01:47:53.873 --> 01:47:55.308
It could kill him.

1708
01:47:55.341 --> 01:47:57.143
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1709
01:47:59.846 --> 01:48:02.291
<i>This country is
confronting a brutal challenge,</i>

1710
01:48:02.315 --> 01:48:04.818
<i>from guerrillas
armed and supported</i>

1711
01:48:04.851 --> 01:48:07.020
<i>by others outside Guatemala.</i>

1712
01:48:07.053 --> 01:48:10.824
<i>The United States is
committed to restoring democracy</i>

1713
01:48:10.857 --> 01:48:13.993
<i>and to address the root causes
of the violent insurgency.</i>

1714
01:48:14.027 --> 01:48:16.830
<i>We know about the problems</i>

1715
01:48:16.863 --> 01:48:18.198
<i>confronting Guatemala.</i>

1716
01:48:19.399 --> 01:48:21.600
Perfect. Round them up.

1717
01:48:31.711 --> 01:48:34.047
<i>Mama!</i>

1718
01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.649
Ignacio!

1719
01:48:57.904 --> 01:48:59.939
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

1720
01:49:11.718 --> 01:49:13.953
Hey! <i>Cabezon!</i>

1721
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.174
You're wrong.

1722
01:50:11.044 --> 01:50:14.447
That love that
I have for my family...

1723
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:19.452
that's what makes me strong.

1724
01:50:31.397 --> 01:50:33.766
All right, give it to me.
Come on.

1725
01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.335
- This?
- Yes, that.

1726
01:50:39.138 --> 01:50:42.909
No!
Now what have you done?

1727
01:50:42.942 --> 01:50:44.477
No! No, no!

1728
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:47.380
Jenny?

1729
01:50:47.413 --> 01:50:49.549
It's okay.

1730
01:50:49.582 --> 01:50:51.384
Carapax, kill them.

1731
01:50:51.417 --> 01:50:52.518
Kill them both!

1732
01:51:00.994 --> 01:51:02.663
Take care of your family.

1733
01:51:02.996 --> 01:51:03.996
Go.

1734
01:51:04.297 --> 01:51:05.898
Okay.

1735
01:51:05.932 --> 01:51:07.276
What are you doing?
They're getting...

1736
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:08.334
Okay.

1737
01:51:09.836 --> 01:51:10.536
No.

1738
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:12.138
Wait, Jenny, wait.

1739
01:51:12.171 --> 01:51:13.515
Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

1740
01:51:13.539 --> 01:51:15.141
- What?
- I promise.

1741
01:51:15.174 --> 01:51:18.945
We can be partners, huh?

1742
01:51:18.978 --> 01:51:21.814
I'll f... I'll fix it.
I'll fix you.

1743
01:51:21.848 --> 01:51:23.983
We can find another Sanchez.

1744
01:51:27.553 --> 01:51:30.089
Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

1745
01:51:35.829 --> 01:51:38.240
I remember everything now.

1746
01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.801
No.

1747
01:51:43.136 --> 01:51:44.971
Khaji, what's he doing?

1748
01:51:45.004 --> 01:51:46.448
<i>He's maxing out
the energy reactor in his suit.</i>

1749
01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:47.940
<i>I advise we back away.</i>

1750
01:51:55.548 --> 01:51:57.183
<i>Ignacio.</i>

1751
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:01.638
It's time...

1752
01:52:03.657 --> 01:52:05.224
What? What?

1753
01:52:05.258 --> 01:52:07.593
What, no! What are you doing?

1754
01:52:07.628 --> 01:52:10.096
Stop! No! No!

1755
01:52:10.856 --> 01:52:12.858
Time to come home.

1756
01:52:14.167 --> 01:52:17.337
Sacrifices must
be made for the greater good.

1757
01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:19.172
No! Please! No!

1758
01:52:19.205 --> 01:52:21.541
Ignacio, no! Stop!

1759
01:52:21.574 --> 01:52:24.043
<i>I suggest we run.</i>

1760
01:52:24.077 --> 01:52:25.278
Okay. Oh, shit.

1761
01:52:43.664 --> 01:52:45.298
Milagro, pull!

1762
01:52:54.273 --> 01:52:56.042
Rocio!

1763
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:13.159
You okay?

1764
01:53:15.962 --> 01:53:16.963
Hi.

1765
01:53:36.182 --> 01:53:37.283
Mili.

1766
01:53:39.318 --> 01:53:40.318
<i>Cabezon.</i>

1767
01:53:41.154 --> 01:53:42.154
Rudy?

1768
01:53:43.322 --> 01:53:44.524
Rudy!

1769
01:53:48.995 --> 01:53:51.063
- How?
- Yeah. You know...

1770
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:52.791
Bad weed never dies.

1771
01:53:55.334 --> 01:53:56.737
<i>Ama.</i>

1772
01:53:56.770 --> 01:53:58.604
Nana.

1773
01:54:02.676 --> 01:54:04.386
Now we can cry.

1774
01:54:30.503 --> 01:54:34.540
<i>It is a delicate moment
for Kord Industries.</i>

1775
01:54:34.574 --> 01:54:38.544
<i>And of course, we mourn
the loss of Victoria Kord.</i>

1776
01:54:38.578 --> 01:54:40.346
<i>But I'm looking forward.</i>

1777
01:54:40.379 --> 01:54:44.016
<i>As I was saying,
we will no longer make weapons.</i>

1778
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:47.186
<i>What I want to do is honor
my father's legacy.</i>

1779
01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:48.622
<i>It's not about destruction,</i>

1780
01:54:48.655 --> 01:54:50.556
<i>it's about building
a better future.</i>

1781
01:54:50.590 --> 01:54:52.592
<i>It's not about taking
from the community,</i>

1782
01:54:52.626 --> 01:54:54.093
<i>but giving back
to the community.</i>

1783
01:55:04.805 --> 01:55:06.372
What are we gonna do now?

1784
01:55:11.377 --> 01:55:12.746
<i>Animo,</i> Rudy, okay?

1785
01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:16.060
We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

1786
01:55:17.718 --> 01:55:19.653
Hey! The Reyes are here.

1787
01:55:20.787 --> 01:55:22.355
Guys.

1788
01:55:37.771 --> 01:55:39.690
Everybody showed up.

1789
01:56:19.478 --> 01:56:20.647
Nana.

1790
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:25.652
Okay.

1791
01:56:34.578 --> 01:56:36.662
Now we can start to rebuild.

1792
01:56:38.331 --> 01:56:40.333
Where, <i>Ama?</i>
We don't have a house.

1793
01:56:40.366 --> 01:56:42.277
Rudy, we have, like, half the
Edge Keys in our yard right now.

1794
01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:44.270
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1795
01:56:44.303 --> 01:56:45.882
Of course they're going to help.

1796
01:56:45.906 --> 01:56:48.507
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1797
01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:50.242
I wouldn't worry about that.

1798
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:52.879
Jenny, Jenny.

1799
01:56:52.913 --> 01:56:53.913
Hi.

1800
01:56:53.972 --> 01:56:55.641
Thank you for coming.

1801
01:56:55.649 --> 01:56:57.660
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1802
01:56:57.684 --> 01:56:59.385
to the people
that made it great.

1803
01:56:59.418 --> 01:57:01.563
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1804
01:57:01.587 --> 01:57:03.322
on Jenny Kord, no?

1805
01:57:03.356 --> 01:57:05.356
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1806
01:57:05.892 --> 01:57:07.493
Starting with you, Rudy.

1807
01:57:07.526 --> 01:57:08.771
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1808
01:57:08.795 --> 01:57:10.797
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1809
01:57:10.831 --> 01:57:12.474
That sounds like something that
you would say to her to tell me.

1810
01:57:12.498 --> 01:57:14.533
And don't worry, Kord Industries

1811
01:57:14.567 --> 01:57:16.502
will fix and give you back
your house.

1812
01:57:19.271 --> 01:57:20.907
Excuse me.

1813
01:57:20.941 --> 01:57:22.609
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1814
01:57:22.643 --> 01:57:24.645
- Here, Rudy.
- What's this?

1815
01:57:24.678 --> 01:57:28.280
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1816
01:57:31.985 --> 01:57:33.654
How do you like that, cupcake?

1817
01:57:33.687 --> 01:57:36.857
Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1818
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:38.959
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1819
01:57:38.992 --> 01:57:41.193
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1820
01:57:41.227 --> 01:57:43.947
- Oh, wow. Come on, help me like it.
- I'm inheriting that.

1821
01:57:45.364 --> 01:57:46.800
All right, I gotta go.

1822
01:57:48.467 --> 01:57:50.202
Yeah.

1823
01:57:50.236 --> 01:57:51.738
How about I walk you out?

1824
01:57:52.739 --> 01:57:54.440
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1825
01:58:03.382 --> 01:58:04.651
So, uh...

1826
01:58:05.852 --> 01:58:07.420
when am I gonna see you again?

1827
01:58:08.021 --> 01:58:10.423
Soon. I hope.

1828
01:58:12.324 --> 01:58:13.459
Where are you headed?

1829
01:58:14.027 --> 01:58:15.829
To my dad's.

1830
01:58:15.862 --> 01:58:17.931
I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

1831
01:58:19.498 --> 01:58:21.768
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1832
01:58:21.802 --> 01:58:23.569
Cool, cool.

1833
01:58:23.602 --> 01:58:24.638
Uh...

1834
01:58:27.339 --> 01:58:28.675
What if I gave you a ride?

1835
01:58:35.649 --> 01:58:36.883
How?

1836
01:58:36.917 --> 01:58:38.384
<i>I feel a surge of blood</i>

1837
01:58:38.417 --> 01:58:39.318
<i>rushing towards your mid-region.</i>

1838
01:58:39.351 --> 01:58:40.486
Stop!

1839
01:58:41.722 --> 01:58:42.923
No, no, no. Not you.

1840
01:58:42.956 --> 01:58:43.956
Oh.

1841
01:58:48.594 --> 01:58:49.663
What's it saying?

1842
01:58:49.696 --> 01:58:50.897
Nothing.

1843
01:59:18.825 --> 01:59:19.825
Okay.

1844
01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.461
Hold on.

1845
01:59:22.495 --> 01:59:24.430
Okay.

1846
02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:45.011
<i>♪ I'm all out of love,
What am I without you? ♪</i>

1847
02:00:45.045 --> 02:00:49.716
<i>♪ I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong ♪</i>

1848
02:00:49.749 --> 02:00:53.620
<i>♪ I'm all out of love,
I'm so lost without you ♪</i>

1849
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:58.892
<i>Hello, hello?</i>

1850
02:00:58.925 --> 02:01:01.493
<i>Oh, my God, it's working.
Okay. Um...</i>

1851
02:01:01.527 --> 02:01:02.929
<i>Whoever turned on my computer,</i>

1852
02:01:02.963 --> 02:01:05.564
<i>get a message
to my daughter, Jenny.</i>

1853
02:01:05.598 --> 02:01:07.067
<i>Jenny Kord.</i>

1854
02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:09.769
<i>Please,
tell her that I love her,</i>

1855
02:01:09.803 --> 02:01:11.503
<i>and that I'm sorry,</i>

1856
02:01:11.537 --> 02:01:14.140
<i>and her dad is alive.</i>

1857
02:01:15.441 --> 02:01:17.911
<i>Ted Kord is alive.</i>

1858
02:07:16.502 --> 02:07:18.371
<i>Oh, that's sexy.</i>
