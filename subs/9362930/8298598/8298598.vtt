tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

5
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.487
-They're cutting into it now.
-Ah. That's exciting.

6
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.256
[Carapax] I've had them working
around the clock

7
00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.291
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

8
00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.427
[woman] Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

-Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
-Sorry.

Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

I don't want
to wait another second.

18
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.747
[Sanchez] Should've called
before making the trip out,
Miss Kord.

19
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.147
This could be another decoy.

20
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.415
It's in there.

21
00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.386

-Of course.

with this gig."

181
00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:52.186
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

182
00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:53.454
How am I supposed to
get experience

183
00:10:53.487 --> 00:10:55.022
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

184
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.357
Sounds like a "you" problem.

185
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.928

-I'm gonna say hi.
-What? No--

been working towards, General.

Okay. Back to work.

204
00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:41.035
I agree. That's a waste
of time, but General,
I am telling you

205
00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.103
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

206
00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:45.172
is gonna blow you away.

207
00:11:45.206 --> 00:11:47.408
Yes. I look forward, also.

208

213
00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.853

a company I built...
my company.

to almost sink

and his reckless management,

done all that,
you know what he did?

-There's something on your--

[Rudy] Hey, Jaime,
keep that blanket

703
00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:38.345
now that it touched
your <i>chorizo.</i>

704
00:34:38.378 --> 00:34:39.714
What is going on?

705
00:34:39.747 --> 00:34:41.281
You can't fly.

706

You can't fly.
Superman can fly.

707
00:34:44.652 --> 00:34:47.789
Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

708
00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:51.458
Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

709
00:34:51.491 --> 00:34:52.894
Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

710
00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:55.597
Yeah, right. Okay.

715
00:35:02.937 --> 00:35:05.305
[in English]
I tried telling him.

716
00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:07.341
Okay, guys. I... I need
to go find Jenny Kord,

717
00:35:07.374 --> 00:35:09.176
'cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

718
00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:10.678
Uh, where are my shoes?

719
00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:13.313
Come on, where are my... shoes.

720
00:35:13.347 --> 00:35:16.316
Not the 84s!

721
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.218
These were my favorite shoes.

Okay, okay.

723
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:21.689
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

724
00:35:21.723 --> 00:35:23.256
<i>Ama,</i> I don't know.

725
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.158
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

726
00:35:25.192 --> 00:35:27.394
-Cut what?
-...and flew into orbit.

727
00:35:27.427 --> 00:35:29.196

Flew into orbit?

-That's why I need Jenny. Okay?
-I am calling the police.

729
00:35:31.264 --> 00:35:35.302
No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.
They work for Kord.

730
00:35:35.335 --> 00:35:36.838
What do you think
Kord's gonna do

731
00:35:36.871 --> 00:35:38.740
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

732
00:35:38.773 --> 00:35:41.542
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

733
00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:43.911
They're gonna lock his ass up.

734
00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:45.813
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

735
00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:47.280
so that we don't tell anybody.

736
00:35:47.314 --> 00:35:48.482
And it's not like
the government isn't

737
00:35:48.516 --> 00:35:49.851
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

738
00:35:49.884 --> 00:35:52.553

This is CIA.

-This is Area 51!
-Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

740
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.894
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

741
00:35:59.927 --> 00:36:01.629
are gonna be all over this,

742
00:36:01.663 --> 00:36:03.531
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

743
00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:07.234
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

744
00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:09.469
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

745
00:36:09.504 --> 00:36:11.371
You are not leaving this house.

Besides, what if she's
in danger?

747
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:15.510

out of the roof.

-Oh!

-Stalked her Insta.
-Where'd I put my...

She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

753
00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:26.888
And she's single, by the way.

754
00:36:26.921 --> 00:36:29.456
Bit of a loner, though,

She's single?

756
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.627
I thought you weren't into her.

Laser-based security system?

General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

903
00:42:15.236 --> 00:42:18.172
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

904
00:42:18.205 --> 00:42:21.175
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

905
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:22.977

-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

920
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.050
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

921

I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

922

This time
I'll do it personally.

923
00:43:08.355 --> 00:43:11.125
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

924
00:43:11.158 --> 00:43:13.928
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

925

suffering your body
has been through.

00:56:48.175 --> 00:56:50.144
Good.

1209
00:56:50.177 --> 00:56:53.047
It must have been
so cool growing up
in a place like this, no?

1210
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.849
Honestly, it was...

1211
00:56:54.882 --> 00:56:57.051
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

1212
00:56:58.653 --> 00:56:59.987
[Jaime] It was just
you three in here?

1213
00:57:00.021 --> 00:57:01.454
[Jenny] Yeah.

1214
00:57:01.488 --> 00:57:02.924
That was my mother's
last painting.

1215
00:57:03.925 --> 00:57:05.226
Why'd she stop?

1216
00:57:05.259 --> 00:57:07.128
My mom died when I was six.

1217
00:57:09.163 --> 00:57:11.799
Oh... We don't...

1218
00:57:11.832 --> 00:57:13.567
-I'm so sorry to...
-It's okay. No, it's okay.

1219
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.602
It's fine.

1220
00:57:16.671 --> 00:57:17.672
What was she like?

1221
00:57:19.006 --> 00:57:20.574
She was great.

1222
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:23.878
She was great.

1223
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:25.146
[sniffles]

1224
00:57:27.148 --> 00:57:29.650
She changed my dad's life.

1225
00:57:29.684 --> 00:57:31.686
She was the one who taught him
that the world

1226
00:57:31.719 --> 00:57:32.987
is a place to protect.

1227
00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.021
Nice.

1228
00:57:36.223 --> 00:57:40.094
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

1229
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:46.534
He obsessed over the Scarab

1230
00:57:46.567 --> 00:57:48.468
and he would disappear
for days.

1231
00:57:50.171 --> 00:57:51.839
Sometimes weeks.

1232
00:57:52.873 --> 00:57:54.141
And one day, he...

1233
00:57:55.977 --> 00:57:57.244
he left and...

1234
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.581
didn't come back.

1235
00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:03.250
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

1236
00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:10.524
You're really lucky.

1237
00:58:10.558 --> 00:58:14.494
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

1238
00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:17.798
Your house is full of love.

1239
00:58:19.834 --> 00:58:20.868
[sniffles]

1240
00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:22.036
[voice breaking] A family.

1241
00:58:23.938 --> 00:58:25.172
Yeah.

1242
00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:26.574
That's a home.

1243
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:30.778
[crying softly]

1244
00:58:30.811 --> 00:58:33.681
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1245
00:58:33.714 --> 00:58:35.316
Sorry for... for what?

1246
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:39.153
I... I haven't
talked about this
in a very long time.

1247
00:58:41.222 --> 00:58:43.157
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

1248
00:58:45.292 --> 00:58:46.660
Thank you.

1249
00:58:47.094 --> 00:58:48.662
Yeah.

1250
00:58:48.696 --> 00:58:50.031
You're a good listener.

1251
00:58:51.966 --> 00:58:54.101
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1252
00:58:54.135 --> 00:58:56.003
[chuckling lightly]

1253
00:59:02.176 --> 00:59:03.577
Hey, guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

1254
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:05.546
-Nothing happened.
-Her mom died.

1255
00:59:06.914 --> 00:59:08.182
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1256
00:59:08.215 --> 00:59:11.619
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

1257
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.655
Nice jammies, <i>guey.</i>

1258
00:59:16.257 --> 00:59:17.658
[sighs]

1259
00:59:19.193 --> 00:59:22.963
[Rudy] Okay. [groans]
I've gone through the files.

1260
00:59:22.997 --> 00:59:26.767
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1261
00:59:26.801 --> 00:59:29.070
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1262
00:59:29.103 --> 00:59:30.905
before it chose you, Jaime.

1263
00:59:30.938 --> 00:59:33.874
And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1264
00:59:33.908 --> 00:59:36.677
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1265
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:39.013
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1266
00:59:39.046 --> 00:59:40.781
It didn't go up my ass.

1267
00:59:40.815 --> 00:59:42.983
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1268
00:59:43.017 --> 00:59:45.853
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

1269
00:59:45.886 --> 00:59:47.688
It's trying to become one
with you.

1270
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:48.889
Why?

1271
00:59:48.923 --> 00:59:50.157
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1272
00:59:50.191 --> 00:59:51.926
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1273
00:59:51.959 --> 00:59:53.027
[Jenny] It's sentient.

1274
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.229
That's why it chooses a host.

1275
00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:58.032
That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

1276
00:59:58.065 --> 01:00:00.034
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1277
01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:02.136
[chuckles] This wasn't made
on Earth, <i>cabezon.</i>

1278
01:00:02.169 --> 01:00:03.904
-No way.
<i>-Si</i> way.

1279
01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:06.006
It's alien.

1280
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.775
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1281
01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:09.810
-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1282
01:00:09.844 --> 01:00:13.380
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

1283
01:00:13.414 --> 01:00:14.682
You might want to sit down.

1284
01:00:17.184 --> 01:00:19.687
-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

1285
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.288
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1286
01:00:21.322 --> 01:00:23.657
The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

1287
01:00:23.691 --> 01:00:25.059
-Fine.
-[chuckles]

1288
01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:27.261
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1289
01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:30.030
-What?
-Dead.

1290
01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:31.332
[Jaime] What do you
mean "dead"?

1291
01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:33.000
[Rudy] Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1292
01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:35.269
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1293
01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:38.839
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1294
01:00:38.873 --> 01:00:41.041
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1295
01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:43.811
It's designed
to protect its host.

1296
01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:45.346
To keep it alive.

1297
01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:47.448
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1298
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:49.683
-[sighing]
-[Rudy] No, it's not forever.

1299
01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:51.285
I mean, it's just until you...

1300
01:00:52.253 --> 01:00:53.921
until you die.

1301
01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:55.856
[stammering]
I think it's kinda cool.

1302
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:59.126
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabron.</i>

1303
01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.695
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

1304
01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:04.398
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

1305
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:07.801
So, option one is
to become an android

1306
01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:09.370
for the rest of my life.

1307
01:01:09.403 --> 01:01:11.839
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1308
01:01:11.872 --> 01:01:13.807
-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

1309
01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:15.176
All I wanted was a job.

1310
01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.711
-[Rudy] Maybe there's a--
-Maybe what, Rudy?

1311
01:01:17.745 --> 01:01:19.246
It's all bad news.

1312
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.814
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1313
01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:22.416
I don't understand
why you can't...

1314
01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:25.786
God. [sighs]

1315
01:01:25.819 --> 01:01:28.255
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1316
01:01:28.289 --> 01:01:30.124
[Jenny] Jaime, just...

1317
01:01:30.157 --> 01:01:32.359
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

1318
01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:34.828
<i>Cabezon,</i> wait up.

1319

God.

1322
01:01:51.345 --> 01:01:54.915
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1323
01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:56.850
[chuckles] Like a cat, Jaime.

1324

[sighs]

1326
01:02:05.459 --> 01:02:07.428
[in English]
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1327
01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:09.797
-I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...
-[Rudy speaks Spanish]

1328
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.933
[in English]
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1329
01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:15.102
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1330
01:02:17.304 --> 01:02:19.373
[light chuckle] Yeah, we're...

1331
01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:21.475
we're resilient people.

1332
01:02:21.509 --> 01:02:25.312
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1333
01:02:25.346 --> 01:02:28.882
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1334
01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:33.087
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1335
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.992
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1336
01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:40.528
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1337
01:02:40.562 --> 01:02:42.564
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1338
01:02:42.597 --> 01:02:47.201
The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

1339
01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:51.839
But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1340
01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:54.041

get his hands on.

[in English]
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1345
01:03:05.219 --> 01:03:07.988
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1346
01:03:09.156 --> 01:03:11.125
That's what we come from.

1347
01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:14.928
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1348
01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:17.965
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

1349
01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:19.933
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1350
01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:24.171
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1351
01:03:25.873 --> 01:03:28.042
And not just some
foot up our ass. [chuckles]

1352
01:03:29.343 --> 01:03:30.377
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1353
01:03:30.411 --> 01:03:31.979
I'm just some failed promise

that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1355
01:03:35.517 --> 01:03:36.817
Don't say that, man.

1356
01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:39.420
You're not a failed promise.

1357
01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:42.122
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1358

-I am the shit.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

But now that you've
activated it,

1700
01:20:46.447 --> 01:20:50.217
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

even talking about?

No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

Oh, bummer.

1704
01:20:55.923 --> 01:20:59.326
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.
