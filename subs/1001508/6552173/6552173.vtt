Thanks a lot.

345
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.557
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

346
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:06.561
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

347
00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:08.771
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting."

348
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:11.023
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

349
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:14.360
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

350
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.822
Okay.

351
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.782
I just was actually in the area...

352
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.244
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

353
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:27.707
Because I had to return his pen.

354
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.959
Had to return this pen. He left this.

355
00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:35.089
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

356
00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.717
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

357
00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:39.719
Thanks.

358
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.558
"Wilson Ward, DDS,
Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry."

359
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:49.979
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

360
00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.690
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

361
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.609
Oh, really. Who is?

362
00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.069
My dad.

363
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.285
Oh.

364
00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.833
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

365
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.419
And I just...

366
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.007
I thought if I just ran into him...

367
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.969
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

368
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:23.763
Wait.

369
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:24.972
Wait, just...

370
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.225
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

371
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.978
One drink. Okay?

372
00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:35.066
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

373
00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:40.821
ALEX: Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

374
00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:43.282
Conor's never gonna call you.

375
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.035
Oh, really. How do you know?

376
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.746
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

377
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.373
He said it was nice meeting me.

378
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.084
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

379
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.586
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

380
00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:58.923
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

381
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.717
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

382
00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:03.302
Or maybe he lost my number...

383
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.515
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

384
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.685
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

385
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:16.274
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

386
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.025
She totally wrote him off.

387
00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:19.860
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

388
00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:21.696
She ran into him,
and it ended up that...

389
00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:24.532
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

390
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.701
...by the way.
The rare exception.

391
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:29.745
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

392
00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:32.707
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

393
00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:37.253
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

394
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.046
- Really?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:41.048
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

396
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:45.219
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

397
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.888
I do it early, I do it often.

398
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:52.518
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

399
00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:55.187
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

400
00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:57.231
No exceptions.

401
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.118
Thank you.

402
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.413
Given me a lot to think about.

403
00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.755
GIGI: Morning, morning.
MAN: Excuse me.

404
00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:22.089
- Hi.
- Hi.

405
00:22:22.257 --> 00:22:23.549
Everything okay?

406
00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:24.842
Oh, I was up all night.

407
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.053
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

408
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.348
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

409
00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.391
JANINE:
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

410
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:35.895
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

411
00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:37.730
Okay.

412
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:39.231
So...

413
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:44.570
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

414
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.865
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

415
00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:51.327
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

416
00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.622
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

417
00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.625
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

418
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:00.753
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

419
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.880
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

420
00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:06.133
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

421
00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:10.513
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

422
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.474
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

423
00:23:13.642 --> 00:23:17.478
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

424
00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:20.189
And then... Oh, there was Don...

425
00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:23.943
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

426
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:25.986
I was delusional about that relationship.

427
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:28.656
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

428
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.117
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

429
00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:33.911
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

430
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.872
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

431
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.999
...and that girl ended up getting married.

432
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:42.253
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

433
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:51.053
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

434
00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:52.930
So what you're saying is...

435
00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:56.392
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

436
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.103
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

437
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.896
Yes.

438
00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:03.941
But the rule are guys like Neil...

439
00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:08.028
...who are with girls like me...

440
00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:10.739
...for seven years and aren't married...

441
00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:12.491
...they're never getting married.

442
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:14.326
- No.
- No.

443
00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:16.036
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

444
00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:20.040
- It's not what she meant in that...
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

445
00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:22.376
I absolutely was not talking about you.

446
00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:26.464
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

447
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:29.216
GIGI:
Just me specifically, you know?

448
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.348
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

449
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:39.768
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

450
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:44.064
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

451
00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:46.233
And then he tells me that he's married.

452
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:48.819
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

453
00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:52.031
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

454
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:53.407
But he's married.

455
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:56.994
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

456
00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.412
What's wrong with me?

457
00:24:59.956 --> 00:25:01.457
Okay.

458
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.418
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

459
00:25:04.586 --> 00:25:09.173
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

460
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:14.053
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

461
00:25:14.221 --> 00:25:18.557
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

462
00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:22.102
That he had finally met the one.

463
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.021
So he divorced his wife...

464
00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:27.441
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

465
00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.944
...and they're insanely happy.

466
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:32.696
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

467
00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.949
...but you already married someone else?

468
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:37.284
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

469
00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:43.040
You're right. Okay.

470
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.875
I'm gonna call him.

471
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:47.211
Okay.

472
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.062
BEN: Hello?
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.

473
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.648
Hey, Anna. What's up?

474
00:26:07.816 --> 00:26:10.901
Nothing, I was just...
I was taking you up on your offer.

475
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:15.489
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

476
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:20.953
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

477
00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:26.375
Look, I just...

478
00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:30.170
I can't, Anna.

479
00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:33.841
You seemed great. I just... I don't know.

480
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:36.010
I should probably go.

481
00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:37.845
Take care, though. Bye.

482
00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:46.854
- Hey.
- Hey.

483
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:48.439
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

484
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:51.025
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

485
00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:52.860
I was just thinking about you.

486
00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.862
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

487
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.864
Okay, what were the categories again?

488
00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.866
Four categories:

489
00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:02.578
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

490
00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:04.913
But you can only be two things.

491
00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:09.418
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

492
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:11.545
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

493
00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:13.547
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

494
00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:15.257
Go. What am I?

495
00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:16.592
Wait, what was I again?

496
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.594
You're smart and cute.

497
00:27:18.762 --> 00:27:21.805
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

498
00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:23.515
And cute.

499
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:26.185
No, you can't...

500
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:28.479
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

501
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.397
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

502
00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:34.568
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,
which obviously you are.

503
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:36.904
Especially sexy.

504
00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.906
ANNA:
You're the best.

505
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.663
I better go.

506
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:50.042
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

507
00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:52.461
What? It's been a while.

508
00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:54.380
No, I can't.

509
00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:56.965
I can't stay, I'm totally...

510
00:27:57.133 --> 00:27:58.759
I'm totally, totally fried.

511
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.094

1028
00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:36.660
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

1029
00:57:36.828 --> 00:57:38.829
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

1030
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:41.748
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

1031
00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:43.792
KEN:
It's true, though.

1032
00:58:01.102 --> 00:58:02.144
Hey.

1033
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.231
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

1034
00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.820
Come on.

1035
00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.242
Sorry I'm late.

1036
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.744
No, it's okay.

1037
00:58:18.912 --> 00:58:20.829
I like a little time before a blind date.

1038
00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:24.708
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

1039
00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:26.084
Gigi, he's not coming.

1040
00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:29.463
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

1041
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:31.423
Hey.

1042
00:58:31.591 --> 00:58:33.258
How could he already not like me?

1043
00:58:33.426 --> 00:58:36.678
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

1044
00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.263
Hi. Are you good?

1045
00:58:38.431 --> 00:58:40.516
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

1046
00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:46.730
GIGI: Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

1047
00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:50.984
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

1048
00:58:51.152 --> 00:58:52.611
- This one right here?
- Mm-hm.

1049
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:54.279
Oh, God, no.

1050
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:56.657
How do you know?

1051
00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.368
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

1052
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.870
She's interested, he's clearly not.

1053
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:05.040
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

1054
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.876
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

1055
00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:10.629
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

1056
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:13.048
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here."

1057
00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.633
And look, how fortuitous.

1058
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:17.469
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

1059
00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:19.888
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

1060
00:59:21.182 --> 00:59:22.975
Man, you have a gift.

1061
00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:25.269
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

1062
00:59:25.436 --> 00:59:29.481
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

1063
00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:31.775
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

1064
00:59:31.943 --> 00:59:34.778
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

1065
00:59:34.946 --> 00:59:36.530
- Really?
- Bullshit.

1066
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.031
Enlighten me.

1067
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:39.866
Guys invented the spark...

1068
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:43.870
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

1069
00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:47.791
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

1070
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:49.543
...was actually just a spark.

1071
00:59:49.711 --> 00:59:52.921
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

1072
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:56.300
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

1073
00:59:56.467 --> 00:59:57.509
I don't.

1074
00:59:57.677 --> 01:00:01.013
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

1075
01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.056
...because secretly you love the drama...

1076
01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:05.684
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

1077
01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.020
Maybe.

1078
01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.771
And let me guess:

1079
01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.190
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

1080
01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.526
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

1081
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.904
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

1082
01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.574
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

1083

[GIGI LAUGHS]

1084
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.578
Okay. Yeah.

1085
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.414
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

1086
01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:30.417
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

1087
01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:33.795
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

1088
01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.006
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

1089
01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.009
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

1090
01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.804
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

1091
01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.806
I don't know, I like you.

1092
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.142
You do?

1093
01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:52.814
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

1094
01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:57.027
I just mean... I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

1095
01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.988
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

Again with the sensitivity.

1097
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.409

- Yeah.

Javier...

1107
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.114
...if I asked you an honest question...

1108
01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:44.700
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

1109
01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.828
- I think so.
- Good, good.

1110
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.290
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

1111
01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:54.793
Javier?

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.753
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

1113
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.464
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

1114
01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:02.092
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

1115
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.593
Javier...

1116
01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.138
...have you guys been smoking...

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.056
...or not?

1118
01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:13.478
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

...sneaking around here?

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:19.901
And smoking?

1122
01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:23.071
And lying to me?

1123
01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.489
And smoking?

1124
01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:25.741

I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

1128

That's a lot of prepositions.

I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

I mean, we have a contract.

That's like making promises. Isn't it?

She's holding out on you, isn't she?

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.514
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

1157
01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.766
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

1158
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:18.353
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.

1159
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.899
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

No, I'm cool.

1161
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.320
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

1162
01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:29.364
We used to sleep together all the time.

1163
01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:34.452
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

1164
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.123
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

1165
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.126
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

1166
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.462
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

1167
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.132
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

1168
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.260
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

1169
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.388
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

1170
01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.308
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

1171
01:04:56.475 --> 01:05:00.228
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you."

1172
01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:03.815
One, two, three.

1173
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.318
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

1174
01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:09.154
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you."

1175
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.822
One, two...

1176
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.658
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

1177
01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.953
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

1178
01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:18.997
All right, well, I can tell you this:

1179
01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.167
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

1180
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:25.629
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

1181
01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.842
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

1182
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.428
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

1183
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.808
TRENT: If a girl's into you,
she's sleeping with you.

1184
01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:42.437
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

1185
01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.689
...she's not sleeping with you?

1186
01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.192
She doesn't like you.

1187
01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.444
The trick is to spot this girl early.

1188
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.531
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

1189
01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:57.535
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

1190
01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:01.039
A girl will never sleep with you...

1191
01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.292
...if she calls you "cuddly"

at work, so I called him at home.

And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

Then he e-mailed me to my home account

had a message from the guy or it didn't.

- Baltimore?
- Your sisters.

2032
02:01:00.002 --> 02:01:01.878
JANINE:
I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

2033
02:01:02.046 --> 02:01:07.050
I've started trying to figure out what
I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?

2034
02:01:07.218 --> 02:01:10.845
Probably seems the wrong time to do that,
but why not? You know, why not?

2035
02:01:11.013 --> 02:01:12.347
Better later than never.

2036
02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:14.224
I'm dating now.

2037
02:01:16.519 --> 02:01:19.145
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?

2038
02:01:19.313 --> 02:01:20.772
Have you been married?

2039
02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.023
MAN:
Yes, I'm married.

2040
02:01:22.191 --> 02:01:23.817
- You are married?
MAN: I am married.

2041
02:01:23.985 --> 02:01:25.819
And what's your question?

2042
02:01:25.987 --> 02:01:29.823
MARY: We're heading there, is that fair?
CONOR: It's moving fast. Just on our way.

2043
02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:32.742
I like him, I'll say that L word.

2044
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:35.870
That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah.

2045
02:01:36.038 --> 02:01:39.207
- I like her a lot, so...
- Good, I'm glad.

2046
02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:41.209
[MOUTHING]
I love her. I love her.

2047
02:01:41.877 --> 02:01:44.379
ANNA: You know, what I've been focusing
my energy on...

2048
02:01:44.547 --> 02:01:48.383
...is like a self-discovery,
as opposed to dating.

2049
02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.969
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.

2050
02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:55.890
Good friend of mine and I
are going to India for a few months.

2051
02:01:56.058 --> 02:01:57.475
We're going on a yoga retreat.

2052
02:01:57.643 --> 02:01:59.894
ALEX:
I really genuinely love this person...

2053
02:02:00.062 --> 02:02:01.938
He had asked me to co-host this party...

2054
02:02:02.106 --> 02:02:03.356
...and I stayed after.

2055
02:02:03.524 --> 02:02:07.235
I was trying to help you out because there
was this girl who would not leave...

2056
02:02:07.403 --> 02:02:10.113
...that tall girl.
- Right. She was gross.

2057
02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:11.656
I was trying to...

2058
02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.658
She was... come on.
