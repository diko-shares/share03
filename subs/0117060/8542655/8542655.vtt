1
00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:55.109
Come on, come on.
She's been under too long.

2
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.180
Come on.

3
00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.351
The name, pal. Give us the name.

4
00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:55.669
<i>Za druziye.</i>

5
00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.025
Get rid of that scum.

6
00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:27.701
Hold her still.

7
00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:32.289
Come on.

8
00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.899
Did we get it?

9
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:00.985
We got it.

10
00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:58.709
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Rosen?

11
00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:00.294
No, thank you.

12
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:08.636
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

13
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.679
No, I prefer the theater.

14
00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:13.474
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

15
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:17.436
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

16
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:23.275
Thank you.

17
00:04:48.384 --> 00:04:50.219
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phelps.</i>

18
00:04:50.344 --> 00:04:53.138
<i>The man you're looking at
is Alexander Golitsyn...</i>

19
00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:55.641
<i>an attach√© at our embassy in Prague.</i>

20
00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:57.518
<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

21
00:04:58.477 --> 00:05:01.272
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list...</i>

22
00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:05.401
<i>a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.</i>

23
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:09.321
<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

24
00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:13.701
<i>The portion that Golitsyn already has
contains code names...</i>

25
00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:15.870
<i>but this half is useless
without its mate...</i>

26
00:05:15.953 --> 00:05:18.414
<i>which matches the code names
with their true names.</i>

27
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:23.127
<i>It is this half which Golitsyn plans
to steal from the embassy...</i>

28
00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:25.629
<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

29
00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:28.257
<i>Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it...</i>

30
00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:31.385
<i>is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft...</i>

31
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.431
<i>shadow Golitsyn to his buyer,
and apprehend them both.</i>

32
00:05:36.182 --> 00:05:39.894
<i>I've already dispatched a team,
selected from your usual group.</i>

33
00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:42.271
<i>Sarah Davies is already undercover.</i>

34
00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:45.399
<i>Jack Harmon can hack
into any security system.</i>

35
00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:47.776
<i>Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance.</i>

36
00:05:47.902 --> 00:05:50.529
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport...</i>

37
00:05:50.613 --> 00:05:53.866
<i>and Ethan Hunt will be
your point man, as usual.</i>

38
00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:56.994
<i>He is now in Kiev
and will rendezvous in Prague...</i>

39
00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:58.996
<i>at a safe house of your choosing.</i>

40
00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:02.166
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your IM Force...</i>

41
00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:04.210
<i>be caught or killed...</i>

42
00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:07.755
<i>the Secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

43
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.883
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

44
00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:12.510
<i>Good luck, Jim.</i>

45
00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:37.201
A very straightforward objective.

46
00:06:37.993 --> 00:06:40.454
We photograph Golitsyn stealing
the NOC list...

47
00:06:40.538 --> 00:06:42.540
follow him to his buyer...

48
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.708
apprehend both of them.

49
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:46.627
Now here's the plot.

50
00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:51.006
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character, during a party...

51
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.300
hide in plain sight,
highest possible profile.

52
00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:57.012
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

53
00:06:58.013 --> 00:07:00.474
Sarah, you're at the party already...

54
00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.643
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

55
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.521
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

56
00:07:05.855 --> 00:07:07.147
I haven't a thing to wear.

57
00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:11.277
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

58
00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:14.697
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

59
00:07:14.822 --> 00:07:16.991
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

60
00:07:17.408 --> 00:07:20.244
- Find yourself a perch and stay on him.
- No problem.

61
00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:21.704
- Jack?
- Yeah?

62
00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:25.541
Fingerprint security, there's access
through the elevator shaft here.

63
00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:27.877
So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.

64
00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:29.545
Open, close, get out.

65
00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:31.672
Zero residual presence.

66
00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.135
Claire, you're cover outside
in the vehicle.

67
00:07:36.218 --> 00:07:38.888
Hannah will join you as Golitsyn
goes exterior...

68
00:07:39.013 --> 00:07:41.640
- you two stay on him from there.
- Okay.

69
00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:43.225
Anything goes wrong, I call abort.

70
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:45.686
Everybody walk away immediately.

71
00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:50.191
Regroup here at 4:00 a. m. That's 0400.

72
00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:52.276
Any questions?

73
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:54.945
Yeah.

74
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:57.823
Can we get
a cappuccino machine in here?

75
00:07:57.907 --> 00:07:59.366
'Cause I don't know what you call this.

76
00:07:59.742 --> 00:08:01.744
I call it cruel and unusual.

77
00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:04.079
- I made that coffee.
- Exactly.

78
00:08:04.205 --> 00:08:06.832
Is it possible it's even worse than
that sludge you made...

79
00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:08.542
- in that barn in Kiev?
- Thank you.

80
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:10.461
Take it easy on my wife's coffee,
will you?

81
00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:14.048
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- Missed you, too, Ethan.

82
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:16.675
Were you off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?

83
00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.469
Where'd they put you up this time?
The Plaza?

84
00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:20.930
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

85
00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:23.557
What a shame.

86
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:26.310
- 24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

87
00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:27.853
Fat expense account.

88
00:08:27.937 --> 00:08:30.439
- Now he's getting soft in his old age.
- Yeah, he is. Look at him.

89
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.399
Okay, listen.

90
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.985
If that list gets out into the open...

91
00:08:35.236 --> 00:08:38.113
the names of our agents
in every country in Eastern Europe...

92
00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:40.199
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders.

93
00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:43.911
Third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords...

94
00:08:44.036 --> 00:08:47.164
any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term coverts like us.

95
00:08:47.873 --> 00:08:51.585
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

96
00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:56.715
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

97
00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:59.510
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

98
00:08:59.802 --> 00:09:02.179
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

99
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.599
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

100
00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:07.434
See?

101
00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:09.645
Can you hear me?

102
00:09:09.728 --> 00:09:12.273
- Of course I can hear you.
- No, in your...

103
00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:14.191
- You need an earpiece.
- Oh.

104
00:09:18.445 --> 00:09:19.780
You have lovely eyes.

105
00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:22.074
- Can you hear me now?
- Loud and clear.

106
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.410
If he has a car waiting, and he rolls...

107
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.037
you stay with him no matter what.

108
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:28.622
You should take the afternoon...

109
00:09:28.747 --> 00:09:30.457
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

110
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:32.251
They're confusing as hell.

111
00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:34.587
What do you think
I've been doing all morning?

112
00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:37.840
- We're using Waltzer?
- He's our guy.

113
00:09:39.175 --> 00:09:41.051
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

114
00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:45.472
Not this week.
This week, he's fly-fishing...

115
00:09:45.723 --> 00:09:47.850
at the Oughterard Slough
in County Kildare...

116
00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:50.394
- with one of our best Irish guides.
- Yep.

117
00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.646
And he won't be back anytime soon.

118
00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:55.232
<i>...irrelevant at best...</i>

119
00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:57.735
<i>or unconstitutional at worst.</i>

120
00:09:57.902 --> 00:09:59.403
<i>With all due respect, Senator...</i>

121
00:09:59.528 --> 00:10:02.406
<i>it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge...</i>

122
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.701
<i>that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s...</i>

123
00:10:05.826 --> 00:10:09.163
<i>and in the process destroy
the intelligence capability...</i>

124
00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:10.247
<i>- of this country.
- No, John.</i>

125
00:10:10.372 --> 00:10:12.499
<i>I want to know who these people are...</i>

126
00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:15.211
<i>and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.</i>

127
00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:18.714
<i>We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.</i>

128
00:10:20.132 --> 00:10:21.383
Stick of gum, right?

129
00:10:22.426 --> 00:10:23.636
- No?
- No.

130
00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:25.846
Red light, green light.

131
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.183
You come up against a lock you
can't pick, you mash them together...

132
00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:32.978
<i>hasta lasagna, don't get any on ya.</i>

133
00:10:33.771 --> 00:10:35.231
You'll have about five seconds.

134
00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:41.237
Just don't chew it.

135
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.276
Ethan, Jack's inside.

136
00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:21.986
Let's go.

137
00:11:27.157 --> 00:11:28.242
<i>How do you do, Senator?</i>

138
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:29.869
<i>I'm Rand Housman,
the ambassador's aide.</i>

139
00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:31.579
<i>- Hello, Mr. Housman.
- How was the opera?</i>

140
00:11:33.372 --> 00:11:34.915
It was boring.

141
00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:37.626
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

142
00:11:47.344 --> 00:11:50.139
<i>- How do you do, Senator?
- His wife, Mrs. Reid.</i>

143
00:11:50.264 --> 00:11:52.057
Windows open by 2300.

144
00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:54.602
- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague.
- How do you do, sir?

145
00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:56.270
And Mrs. Brandl.

146
00:11:58.814 --> 00:12:00.691
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

147
00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:03.152
Why, of course I do.
How are you, Miss Norman?

148
00:12:03.235 --> 00:12:05.571
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

149
00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:12.953
Mr. Golitsyn, nice to see you.

150
00:12:14.997 --> 00:12:15.998
Hannah...

151
00:12:19.793 --> 00:12:20.794
<i>pull the shade.</i>

152
00:12:31.138 --> 00:12:33.766
<i>Sarah, mark the package
and go to tunnel.</i>

153
00:12:39.313 --> 00:12:42.233
Your advance team mentioned
that you'd like a tour of the facilities...

154
00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:44.485
so I've gone ahead and set one up.
Excuse me.

155
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.819
This way. Thank you.

156
00:12:57.748 --> 00:12:59.124
Oh, great.

157
00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:01.835
...which leads to the denied area...

158
00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:05.214
which is the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

159
00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:31.574
Governor's in position now.

160
00:13:41.584 --> 00:13:44.003
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- I'm sorry.

161
00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:47.548
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance...

162
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:50.009
and this place is like...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

163
00:13:50.092 --> 00:13:51.886
I know it's in here somewhere.

164
00:13:51.969 --> 00:13:54.930
Now, Sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

165
00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:59.768
<i>We've been ordered
to wear civilian clothes this evening, sir.</i>

166
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:03.480
Be right back.

167
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.110
Tell me, Senator, do you not have
someone on your staff named Jack?

168
00:14:08.777 --> 00:14:11.864
<i>Jack? Well, I think we did have a Jack.</i>

169
00:14:11.947 --> 00:14:15.534
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall, constantly late...

170
00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:17.411
<i>behind in his work.</i>

171
00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:23.417
<i>We were forced to tie him behind
one of my best stallions...</i>

172
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.627
and drag him around...

173
00:14:24.752 --> 00:14:26.587
<i>my barn for a few days.</i>

174
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.756
Relax your crap, Foghorn.
I'm working on it.

175
00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:43.771
Sorry, sir.

176
00:14:44.438 --> 00:14:45.856
- Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.

177
00:14:45.981 --> 00:14:46.941
Thank you.

178
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.580
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

179
00:15:31.068 --> 00:15:32.069
Higher.

180
00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.869
He's heading to the denied area.

181
00:15:42.538 --> 00:15:43.664
<i>Get moving, Ethan.</i>

182
00:15:43.873 --> 00:15:44.915
He's rolling to you.

183
00:15:55.843 --> 00:15:56.886
Jack.

184
00:15:59.555 --> 00:16:00.723
Jack, we're in position here.

185
00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:04.560
<i>- Jack.
- I didn't touch it.</i>

186
00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:09.190
What about my coat?
I'm going to freeze.

187
00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:10.524
Jack, open the doors.

188
00:16:20.868 --> 00:16:22.870
He's in the box, Ethan. He's in the box.

189
00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:24.747
<i>Okay.</i>

190
00:16:24.872 --> 00:16:26.874
We're taking Golitsyn's exit.
Open these doors.

191
00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:28.334
I don't have it.

192
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.129
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

193
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.883
Go.

194
00:17:15.798 --> 00:17:17.758
- He's got it.
- All right.

195
00:17:18.634 --> 00:17:21.971
<i>- Saved your ass again, Jack.
- Give me a break, pops.</i>

196
00:17:22.096 --> 00:17:23.639
Such a nice ass.

197
00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:25.683
And a lonely ass.

198
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.311
- Transport in five minutes.
- Yes, indeed.

199
00:18:12.563 --> 00:18:15.608
Jack, we're in position.
Open the doors and let the package roll.

200
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:17.860
Roger that. Opening doors now.

201
00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:20.654
Stairway, you're wrapped.

202
00:18:20.738 --> 00:18:22.323
<i>Go to transport.</i>

203
00:18:28.329 --> 00:18:29.330
Hey.

204
00:18:32.041 --> 00:18:34.418
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

205
00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:42.343
I don't have control, Jack.

206
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.387
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

207
00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:50.267
- Cut the power, Jack.
- Come on, Jack.

208
00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:52.561
Cut the power.

209
00:18:52.686 --> 00:18:53.771
<i>Jack?</i>

210
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.065
Jack?

211
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:03.614
Jack?

212
00:19:05.741 --> 00:19:06.825
Jack?

213
00:19:08.869 --> 00:19:09.954
Jack?

214
00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:12.915
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

215
00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:15.501
<i>- Jack?
- Man down, Ethan.</i>

216
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.211
<i>Man down.</i>

217
00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:38.816
<i>Ethan, stay where you are.</i>

218
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.277
I'm coming to you.

219
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.002
The package is out in the open.

220
00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:03.632
Jim...

221
00:20:04.466 --> 00:20:05.926
<i>he's in the open.</i>

222
00:20:06.051 --> 00:20:07.052
En route.

223
00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:28.240
Jim, he's in the open.

224
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.453
Jim, the package is in the open.

225
00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:39.793
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

226
00:20:40.336 --> 00:20:41.754
No. Abort.

227
00:20:42.463 --> 00:20:43.506
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

228
00:20:48.677 --> 00:20:49.970
I can't do that.

229
00:20:50.054 --> 00:20:52.973
We're being ambushed, Ethan. Abort.
That's an order.

230
00:20:53.057 --> 00:20:55.518
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

231
00:20:55.643 --> 00:20:57.811
<i>No, damn it! No! I said abort!</i>

232
00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:10.658
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming to you.

233
00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:12.618
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

234
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.455
No. We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

235
00:21:17.456 --> 00:21:18.666
Now, go.

236
00:21:51.115 --> 00:21:52.491
Where are you?

237
00:21:52.575 --> 00:21:54.410
About 200 yards from the bridge.

238
00:21:54.493 --> 00:21:55.870
<i>They're covering this frequency.</i>

239
00:21:55.953 --> 00:21:57.830
Cut all radio communication.

240
00:21:57.913 --> 00:22:00.624
<i>Repeat. Cut all radio communication.</i>

241
00:22:26.108 --> 00:22:27.234
<i>Ethan!</i>

242
00:22:33.657 --> 00:22:34.867
<i>Ethan...</i>

243
00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.936
Sarah, abort.

244
00:23:02.478 --> 00:23:04.104
Repeat, abort.

245
00:23:07.608 --> 00:23:08.734
Abort!

246
00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:10.277
Do you read me?

247
00:23:14.782 --> 00:23:16.617
Sarah? God!

248
00:23:48.023 --> 00:23:50.401
Claire. Oh, my God.

249
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.486
My God.

250
00:24:40.743 --> 00:24:43.078
Oh, no. Sarah.

251
00:25:38.467 --> 00:25:39.635
My God.

252
00:25:40.636 --> 00:25:42.096
<i>Satcom seven.</i>

253
00:25:42.596 --> 00:25:45.307
<i>- Central Europe, unsecured.
- Designator?</i>

254
00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:48.894
<i>- Bravo-echo-one-one.
- Switching.</i>

255
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.732
<i>- This is Kittridge.
- Go secure.</i>

256
00:25:54.066 --> 00:25:55.734
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

257
00:25:57.194 --> 00:25:59.822
This is Ethan Hunt. They're dead.

258
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.200
<i>What? Who's dead?</i>

259
00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:05.995
<i>- My team. My team is dead!
- Jesus.</i>

260
00:26:06.495 --> 00:26:08.080
Golitsyn's gone.

261
00:26:08.163 --> 00:26:09.665
They knew we were coming, man.

262
00:26:09.748 --> 00:26:12.501
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

263
00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:13.961
<i>Are you intact?</i>

264
00:26:14.044 --> 00:26:17.673
The disk is gone, did you...
Do you read me? The list is in the open!

265
00:26:17.756 --> 00:26:19.091
<i>Listen, I read you.</i>

266
00:26:19.717 --> 00:26:22.386
<i>Let's just bring you in safely
and then we'll worry about that, okay?</i>

267
00:26:23.345 --> 00:26:24.930
<i>Were you followed?</i>

268
00:26:27.349 --> 00:26:30.686
<i>- I don't think so. I don't think so.
- Don't think. Be sure.</i>

269
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.314
<i>- Are you clean?
- Yes.</i>

270
00:26:34.648 --> 00:26:38.027
<i>Okay. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

271
00:26:39.612 --> 00:26:41.697
<i>- You're in Prague?
- One hour.</i>

272
00:27:38.003 --> 00:27:39.129
I am...

273
00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:43.759
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

274
00:27:44.927 --> 00:27:48.514
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you, Ethan...

275
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:51.308
personally as well as professionally.

276
00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:53.644
Yeah.

277
00:27:58.607 --> 00:28:01.694
Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill.

278
00:28:03.112 --> 00:28:05.948
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada, debrief you at Langley.

279
00:28:06.282 --> 00:28:08.200
Throw the Prague police a bone or two.

280
00:28:08.325 --> 00:28:10.452
You know, toss them a few suspects.

281
00:28:14.957 --> 00:28:15.958
You follow me?

282
00:28:18.294 --> 00:28:19.420
Yeah, I follow.

283
00:28:22.047 --> 00:28:23.966
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

284
00:28:24.884 --> 00:28:27.803
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

285
00:28:29.763 --> 00:28:32.057
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

286
00:28:34.143 --> 00:28:35.102
Who else is left?

287
00:28:37.104 --> 00:28:39.815
Yeah. I see your point.

288
00:28:45.654 --> 00:28:46.780
Why was there another team?

289
00:28:48.115 --> 00:28:49.074
What?

290
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.495
Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

291
00:28:55.664 --> 00:28:56.874
I don't quite follow you.

292
00:29:00.878 --> 00:29:02.922
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

293
00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:06.675
The drunk Russians
on the embankment at 7:00 and 8:00...

294
00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:13.015
the couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at 9:00 and 11:00...

295
00:29:13.098 --> 00:29:15.893
the waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs.

296
00:29:16.018 --> 00:29:17.520
Bow tie, 12:00.

297
00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:19.813
The other IMF team.

298
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.776
You're worried about me. Why?

299
00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:28.489
Well, for a little over two years...

300
00:29:28.614 --> 00:29:32.368
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

301
00:29:32.493 --> 00:29:34.036
We have a penetration.

302
00:29:34.912 --> 00:29:37.373
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet...

303
00:29:37.456 --> 00:29:39.750
from a Czech we know as Max.

304
00:29:40.042 --> 00:29:42.378
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

305
00:29:43.546 --> 00:29:46.715
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts...

306
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.011
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

307
00:29:52.096 --> 00:29:54.431
This time, he'd gotten to
someone on the inside.

308
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:58.727
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

309
00:29:58.978 --> 00:30:01.355
An operation he referred to as job 314...

310
00:30:01.438 --> 00:30:04.066
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

311
00:30:07.111 --> 00:30:09.196
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

312
00:30:10.239 --> 00:30:14.243
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

313
00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:16.495
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

314
00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:23.586
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

315
00:30:29.258 --> 00:30:31.760
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

316
00:30:32.344 --> 00:30:33.429
Yeah.

317
00:30:35.973 --> 00:30:38.267
The mole's deep inside...

318
00:30:40.561 --> 00:30:42.313
and like you said...

319
00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:47.651
you survived.

320
00:30:50.404 --> 00:30:52.531
I want to show you something, Ethan.

321
00:30:55.034 --> 00:30:56.660
Since your father's death...

322
00:30:56.785 --> 00:30:59.872
your family's farm has been
in receivership...

323
00:30:59.955 --> 00:31:04.293
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

324
00:31:04.376 --> 00:31:05.711
Your father's illness...

325
00:31:05.794 --> 00:31:07.963
was supposed to have wiped out
that bank account.

326
00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:11.509
Dying slowly in America, after all...

327
00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:14.094
can be a very expensive proposition.

328
00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:17.181
So...

329
00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:22.353
why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

330
00:31:25.147 --> 00:31:27.441
I can understand you're very upset.

331
00:31:27.525 --> 00:31:30.110
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

332
00:31:30.194 --> 00:31:32.947
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

333
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.241
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed...

334
00:31:35.366 --> 00:31:37.493
and you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

335
00:31:37.576 --> 00:31:39.620
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

336
00:31:39.703 --> 00:31:41.705
I just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

337
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.913
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

338
00:34:12.857 --> 00:34:15.359
<i>The other day, we decoded a message

Job 314. I can't...

Job...

345
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.551
Job 3:14?

346
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.637
Job 3:14.

347
00:35:46.617 --> 00:35:48.452
You son of a bitch.

348
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.011
Ethan...

349
00:37:31.222 --> 00:37:32.932
what are you doing?

350
00:37:34.725 --> 00:37:38.187
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you on the bridge...

351
00:37:40.564 --> 00:37:42.441
but you weren't there.

352
00:37:45.819 --> 00:37:47.196
<i>Ethan.</i>

353
00:37:49.073 --> 00:37:50.324
Ethan.

354
00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:53.202
Ethan?

355
00:37:58.415 --> 00:37:59.750
Don't move.

356
00:38:01.502 --> 00:38:02.711
Ethan.

357
00:38:03.337 --> 00:38:06.215
Ethan, it's okay. Just calm down.

358
00:38:06.799 --> 00:38:08.217
It's Claire.

359
00:38:09.009 --> 00:38:11.303
- It's okay.
- You were in the car.

360
00:38:11.887 --> 00:38:13.639
No, I wasn't.

361
00:38:15.766 --> 00:38:17.184
I heard on the radio...

362
00:38:17.268 --> 00:38:20.437
Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

363
00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:23.107
No, I got out of the car.

364
00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:26.402
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

365
00:38:26.527 --> 00:38:29.238
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

366
00:38:29.363 --> 00:38:32.491
- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

367
00:38:32.616 --> 00:38:34.743
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

368
00:38:34.952 --> 00:38:37.246
They're dead! They're all dead!

369
00:38:45.254 --> 00:38:48.174
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead?

370
00:38:48.299 --> 00:38:50.593
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

371
00:38:52.011 --> 00:38:53.012
Take off your coat.

372
00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:03.939
- Where were you, huh?
- I...

373
00:39:06.317 --> 00:39:07.818
Where were you?

374
00:39:08.986 --> 00:39:12.948
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

375
00:39:13.365 --> 00:39:15.951
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

376
00:39:16.327 --> 00:39:18.162
- Did they send you for me?
- Who's "they"?

377
00:39:18.287 --> 00:39:19.914
Did they send you?

378
00:39:19.997 --> 00:39:21.749
Look, who sent you? Who sent you?

379
00:39:21.832 --> 00:39:24.168
No one sent me. No one sent me.

380
00:39:24.293 --> 00:39:26.337
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00.

381
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:31.175
4:00 if we abort.
We don't return here until 4:00, 0400...

382
00:39:31.342 --> 00:39:34.303
4:00 a. m. 4:00, Ethan, 4:00.

383
00:39:35.012 --> 00:39:36.347
If we abort.

384
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:39.600
4:00 a. m.

385
00:39:58.994 --> 00:39:59.995
I've been disavowed.

386
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:09.463
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

387
00:40:16.637 --> 00:40:20.391
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parent's bank account.

388
00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:23.269
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing...

389
00:40:23.394 --> 00:40:26.605
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max...

390
00:40:26.814 --> 00:40:28.107
for the last two years...

391
00:40:29.692 --> 00:40:31.277
to get him our NOC list.

392
00:40:33.237 --> 00:40:34.321
What are you gonna do?

393
00:40:35.656 --> 00:40:36.699
I'm gonna get it for him.

394
00:40:38.492 --> 00:40:40.953
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

395
00:40:42.872 --> 00:40:44.081
Whoever the mole is...

396
00:40:45.124 --> 00:40:46.625
I think goes by the name of Job.

397
00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:50.045
I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list...

398
00:40:52.006 --> 00:40:53.132
he'll find me.

399
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:56.385
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk
to Kittridge myself.

400
00:40:56.468 --> 00:40:58.637
And I'm gonna tell him
you had nothing to do with this.

401
00:40:58.762 --> 00:41:01.098
Claire, if you're not dead...

402
00:41:02.308 --> 00:41:04.685
he's gonna assume you're with me.

403
00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:21.494
The message is for Job.

404
00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:27.124
That's right, and I'm gonna answer it.

405
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.399
Excuse me.

406
00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:55.569
Can I trouble you for a match?

407
00:42:11.669 --> 00:42:13.712
Would you remove your hat, please?

408
00:42:17.049 --> 00:42:20.219
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

409
00:42:21.345 --> 00:42:22.888
The price of admission.

410
00:42:33.524 --> 00:42:36.485
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood.

411
00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:38.153
No one sees Max.

412
00:42:39.655 --> 00:42:41.031
Then what the hell am I doing here?

413
00:42:42.366 --> 00:42:45.870
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

414
00:42:46.328 --> 00:42:48.956
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

415
00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:51.959
Well, if Max doesn't like
what you have to say...

416
00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:55.504
you'll be wearing
that shroud indefinitely.

417
00:42:57.673 --> 00:42:59.133
I'm willing to take the chance.

418
00:43:05.014 --> 00:43:06.348
Very well.

419
00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:14.148
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

420
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:18.319
I need $150,000.

421
00:43:20.362 --> 00:43:21.488
Oh, really?

422
00:43:26.785 --> 00:43:28.204
And you thought...

423
00:43:28.287 --> 00:43:30.748
if you simply showed up,
I might give it to you?

424
00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:34.210
Why not? You gave Job $125,000.

425
00:43:36.962 --> 00:43:40.883
The penny drops. You are not Job.

426
00:43:43.636 --> 00:43:47.640
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

427
00:43:48.557 --> 00:43:52.937
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.

428
00:43:53.062 --> 00:43:54.772
Job is not playful.

429
00:43:56.607 --> 00:43:59.860
So you are something of a paradox.

430
00:44:00.778 --> 00:44:02.947
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

431
00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:05.491
Whether you like a paradox.

432
00:44:07.868 --> 00:44:10.704
I want $150,000 today.

433
00:44:10.788 --> 00:44:13.332
No, no. That's quite out of the question.

434
00:44:16.001 --> 00:44:18.921
The disk Job sold you, it's worthless.

435
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.633
It's bait, part of an internal mole hunt.

436
00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:30.015
And how might you know that?

437
00:44:32.101 --> 00:44:34.228
Are you another Company man?

438
00:44:36.689 --> 00:44:37.898
Like Job?

439
00:44:42.236 --> 00:44:44.113
We're asking about you.

440
00:44:45.906 --> 00:44:47.700
I'm NOC. Was...

441
00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:50.411
Now, disavowed.

442
00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:53.372
Why, may I ask?

443
00:44:54.081 --> 00:44:56.375
That is the question I want to ask Job.

444
00:44:58.335 --> 00:45:02.173
I don't know Job any more
than Job knows me.

445
00:45:02.423 --> 00:45:03.757
Even so...

446
00:45:04.175 --> 00:45:06.385
I'm sure
you could arrange an introduction.

447
00:45:06.468 --> 00:45:07.678
Why should I?

448
00:45:07.803 --> 00:45:10.014
Because I can deliver
the actual NOC list.

449
00:45:10.306 --> 00:45:12.057
The one you have is
not only worthless...

450
00:45:12.183 --> 00:45:13.851
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device...

451
00:45:13.934 --> 00:45:15.561
to pinpoint your exact location.

452
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.359
Boot it up.

453
00:45:23.152 --> 00:45:25.112
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

454
00:45:25.237 --> 00:45:28.199
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like jackrabbits.

455
00:45:31.911 --> 00:45:33.996
It's easy to say the disk is worthless...

456
00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:36.415
when you say I can't look
at the information...

457
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.002
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

458
00:45:41.253 --> 00:45:44.340
Okay, use it. But...

459
00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:47.510
I'd suggest you pack first.

460
00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:05.736
26, 27. So far, so good.

461
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.572
Not so good for you, my friend.

462
00:46:08.697 --> 00:46:10.825
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

463
00:46:43.732 --> 00:46:45.109
32 and 33.

464
00:46:45.234 --> 00:46:48.320
Doesn't mean it's a signal.
Could just be the hard drive heating up.

465
00:46:56.078 --> 00:46:57.413
44 and 45.

466
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:13.929
Now.

467
00:47:46.212 --> 00:47:48.172
Man's gone black, Barnes.

468
00:47:49.548 --> 00:47:51.592
He's under until he decides to surface.

469
00:47:51.717 --> 00:47:54.595
Look, we can use somebody at the
embassy. Involve the local authorities.

470
00:47:54.678 --> 00:47:58.265
- We can cut off his transportation...
- What can we do, Barnes?

471
00:47:58.349 --> 00:48:00.309
Put a guy at the airport?

472
00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:02.645
How many identities
do you think Hunt has?

473
00:48:02.728 --> 00:48:04.605
How many times has
he slipped past customs...

474
00:48:04.688 --> 00:48:06.524
in how many countries?

475
00:48:06.982 --> 00:48:08.776
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

476
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:11.862
We taught them to do it,
for Christ's sake.

477
00:48:11.987 --> 00:48:13.280
Well, what do you suggest?

478
00:48:15.616 --> 00:48:18.744
Let's not waste time chasing after him,
just make him come to us.

479
00:48:19.453 --> 00:48:21.330
Everybody has pressure points, Barnes.

480
00:48:21.455 --> 00:48:24.291
You find something
that's personally important to him...

481
00:48:24.416 --> 00:48:26.001
and you squeeze.

482
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.010
Gunther will never let me have
one of his apartments again.

483
00:48:37.012 --> 00:48:40.599
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.

484
00:48:41.141 --> 00:48:42.101
Thanks, Max.

485
00:48:43.477 --> 00:48:44.728
Or is it Maxine?

486
00:48:46.856 --> 00:48:48.357
I don't have to tell you...

487
00:48:48.482 --> 00:48:51.235
what a comfort anonymity can be
in my profession.

488
00:48:53.028 --> 00:48:55.030
It's like a warm blanket.

489
00:48:58.993 --> 00:49:02.037
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

490
00:49:02.163 --> 00:49:04.498
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

491
00:49:06.709 --> 00:49:07.960
What was your deal with Job?

492
00:49:08.878 --> 00:49:10.212
$6 million.

493
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:14.633
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now...

494
00:49:14.758 --> 00:49:16.177
not just Eastern Europe.

495
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.262
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

496
00:49:18.345 --> 00:49:20.723
- I want the entire list.
- $10 million.

497
00:49:21.891 --> 00:49:24.185
$10 million in negotiable
US Treasury certificates...

498
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.687
in bearer form, coupons attached.

499
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:28.772
And one more thing.

500
00:49:30.733 --> 00:49:35.070
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

501
00:49:48.334 --> 00:49:49.293
Oh.

502
00:49:51.879 --> 00:49:53.255
Max made a deal with you?

503
00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:57.676
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

504
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:05.434
We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta
but only 20 for the SIG Sauer.

505
00:50:05.976 --> 00:50:08.312
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor...

506
00:50:09.355 --> 00:50:10.898
plenty of passports, and...

507
00:50:16.362 --> 00:50:17.488
What?

508
00:50:18.489 --> 00:50:20.366
You said it yourself.

509
00:50:20.783 --> 00:50:22.535
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

510
00:50:24.537 --> 00:50:25.746
Are you sure about this?

511
00:50:26.705 --> 00:50:28.249
Jim was my husband.

512
00:50:28.374 --> 00:50:30.626
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

513
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.296
We're gonna need some help.

514
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:37.550
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

515
00:50:38.384 --> 00:50:39.426
What kind of help?

516
00:51:13.544 --> 00:51:14.920
Simple game.

517
00:51:15.838 --> 00:51:17.256
Four players.

518
00:51:17.756 --> 00:51:19.633
Exfil opens the pocket.

519
00:51:19.842 --> 00:51:21.510
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

520
00:51:22.803 --> 00:51:23.846
Bank?

521
00:51:24.805 --> 00:51:25.973
IMF mainframe.

522
00:51:27.766 --> 00:51:29.059
Where exactly is it?

523
00:51:29.768 --> 00:51:30.853
In Langley.

524
00:51:34.064 --> 00:51:35.024
In Langley?

525
00:51:36.567 --> 00:51:37.776
The one in Virginia, Langley?

526
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.031
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

527
00:51:43.908 --> 00:51:44.867
Is he serious?

528
00:51:46.035 --> 00:51:46.994
Always.

529
00:51:49.371 --> 00:51:53.083
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

530
00:51:53.292 --> 00:51:56.003
I can fly a helicopter right in
through the lobby...

531
00:51:56.086 --> 00:51:57.755
and set it down inside the vault...

532
00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.592
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

533
00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:02.885
What are we downloading?

534
00:52:03.844 --> 00:52:05.596
- Information.
- What kind?

535
00:52:06.013 --> 00:52:07.097
Profitable.

536
00:52:08.224 --> 00:52:09.642
Payment on delivery.

537
00:52:12.436 --> 00:52:13.437
I don't know.

538
00:52:14.897 --> 00:52:16.065
I just don't know.

539
00:52:19.068 --> 00:52:21.195
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

540
00:52:22.696 --> 00:52:24.490
What did they used to call you,
the Net Ranger?

541
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.200
Phineas Phreak?

542
00:52:27.618 --> 00:52:30.371
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO Ghost Com.

543
00:52:30.579 --> 00:52:33.916
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

544
00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:36.794
With that...

545
00:52:37.628 --> 00:52:39.880
that exceptional piece of work.

546
00:52:43.926 --> 00:52:45.219
You don't know what you're missing.

547
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:50.850
- This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

548
00:52:52.142 --> 00:52:56.063
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU-III...

549
00:52:56.146 --> 00:52:58.148
Krieger can get it, right?

550
00:53:00.067 --> 00:53:01.402
May take a little time.

551
00:53:01.527 --> 00:53:02.736
What the hell do you mean,
"a little time"?

552
00:53:03.654 --> 00:53:05.030
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

553
00:53:05.906 --> 00:53:07.867
Thinking-machine laptops.

554
00:53:09.577 --> 00:53:14.373
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes
with the artificial intelligence risk chip.

555
00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:16.542
24 hours.

556
00:53:19.128 --> 00:53:22.715
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

557
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.384
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.

558
00:53:31.098 --> 00:53:34.643
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

559
00:53:35.936 --> 00:53:38.397
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

560
00:53:39.356 --> 00:53:40.816
It's in what we call the stand-alone...

561
00:53:41.984 --> 00:53:45.571
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

562
00:53:47.031 --> 00:53:48.449
Relax, Luther.

563
00:53:49.116 --> 00:53:50.409
It's much worse than you think.

564
00:53:51.869 --> 00:53:53.996
The terminal is
in a black vault lockdown.

565
00:53:54.747 --> 00:53:56.415
<i>The only person allowed in the room...</i>

566
00:53:56.499 --> 00:53:58.918
<i>has to pass through a series
of security checks.</i>

567
00:53:59.043 --> 00:54:00.377
William Donloe.

568
00:54:01.295 --> 00:54:05.508
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.</i>

569
00:54:09.136 --> 00:54:10.721
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

570
00:54:12.598 --> 00:54:14.517
<i>Next, he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

571
00:54:18.771 --> 00:54:21.440
<i>And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures...</i>

572
00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:24.693
<i>are only deactivated
by a double-electronic keycard...</i>

573
00:54:25.486 --> 00:54:26.487
which we won't have.

574
00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:31.242
<i>Now, inside the black vault...</i>

575
00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:33.160
<i>there are three systems operating...</i>

576
00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:36.080
<i>whenever the technician
is out of the room.</i>

577
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.668
<i>The first is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

578
00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:45.548
<i>The second system
detects any increase in temperature.</i>

579
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:48.384
<i>Even the body heat
of an unauthorized person in the room...</i>

580
00:54:48.467 --> 00:54:51.512
<i>will trigger it if the temperature rises
just a single degree.</i>

581
00:54:56.934 --> 00:55:00.020
<i>Now, that temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning...</i>

582
00:55:00.145 --> 00:55:03.274
<i>coming in through an overhead duct,
30 feet above the floor.</i>

583
00:55:06.026 --> 00:55:08.487
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

584
00:55:11.949 --> 00:55:15.161
<i>The third system is on the floor,
and is pressure-sensitive.</i>

585
00:55:16.453 --> 00:55:19.373
<i>The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.</i>

586
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.085
<i>And any one of these systems,
if set off...</i>

587
00:55:23.169 --> 00:55:25.754
<i>will activate an automatic lockdown.</i>

588
00:55:27.131 --> 00:55:29.967
<i>Now, believe me
when I tell you, gentlemen...</i>

589
00:55:30.509 --> 00:55:33.596
<i>all three systems are state-of-the-art.</i>

590
00:55:38.058 --> 00:55:39.768
And you really think we can do this?

591
00:55:43.939 --> 00:55:44.940
We're going to do it.

592
00:56:18.182 --> 00:56:20.643
We picked up alarms
in Sector 3, 7, and 12.

593
00:56:20.768 --> 00:56:23.521
<i>Yeah, that's what I've got, too.
What sector's the air conditioning?</i>

594
00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:26.106
<i>21, but there's no alarm in Sector 21.</i>

595
00:56:26.232 --> 00:56:28.025
<i>No, I gotta get in there and shut it down.</i>

596
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:29.818
<i>I'm sorry,
but nobody gets into any sector...</i>

597
00:56:29.902 --> 00:56:30.945
<i>where an alarm hasn't gone off.</i>

598
00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:32.905
<i>You wanna blow the fire
through this whole building?</i>

599
00:56:32.988 --> 00:56:35.616
<i>Look, no one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...</i>

600
00:56:35.699 --> 00:56:38.244
<i>- and it hasn't gone off in 21.
- Wait.</i>

601
00:56:42.915 --> 00:56:44.333
<i>It's gone off. Let's go.</i>

602
00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:45.751
Let's move.

603
00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.599
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

604
00:57:03.519 --> 00:57:05.187
21's through here.

605
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:13.529
He's recruiting.

606
00:57:13.654 --> 00:57:16.115
- For what purpose?
- Survival.

607
00:57:16.532 --> 00:57:19.410
Too shortsighted. This guy initiates.
He's proactive.

608
00:57:19.535 --> 00:57:22.872
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

609
00:57:22.997 --> 00:57:25.457
And Barnes, what the hell's that noise?

610
00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:27.835
Fire alarm, Gene.

611
00:57:31.297 --> 00:57:32.631
Do we have to evacuate?

612
00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:23.557
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

613
00:58:25.392 --> 00:58:27.978
Krieger! Zero body count.

614
00:58:28.729 --> 00:58:29.813
We'll see.

615
01:00:03.407 --> 01:00:04.492
Hi there.

616
01:01:05.427 --> 01:01:09.723
One, two, three.

617
01:01:10.516 --> 01:01:12.726
Toast. Toast.

618
01:01:13.811 --> 01:01:15.855
<i>- Check.
- Good.</i>

619
01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:19.400
Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

620
01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:22.862
<i>Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?</i>

621
01:01:31.203 --> 01:01:32.288
Damn.

622
01:01:32.413 --> 01:01:36.250
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

623
01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.119
He's rolling to you.

624
01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:00.084
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

625
01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:01.460
William Donloe.

626
01:03:17.685 --> 01:03:18.769
Outer room.

627
01:03:23.649 --> 01:03:25.359
He's coming in the vault.

628
01:03:31.157 --> 01:03:32.158
Come on, move.

629
01:05:01.247 --> 01:05:02.623
He's in the bathroom.

630
01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:22.703
A- W-9...

631
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.830
<i>6- B-6.</i>

632
01:06:44.558 --> 01:06:46.227
Holy mother of God.

633
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:48.145
<i>The NOC list.</i>

634
01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:47.116
He's at the vault.

635
01:10:00.671 --> 01:10:01.881
Four yellows.

636
01:10:05.092 --> 01:10:06.051
One red.

637
01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.772
Get moving.

638
01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:21.650
Toast.

639
01:10:23.194 --> 01:10:24.195
Toast.

640
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.241
<i>Merci.</i>

641
01:11:27.174 --> 01:11:28.384
Oh, my God.

642
01:11:39.937 --> 01:11:40.938
Yeah.

643
01:11:44.316 --> 01:11:45.818
It's for you.

644
01:11:47.778 --> 01:11:48.821
Kittridge.

645
01:12:12.178 --> 01:12:16.515
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops, you understand?

646
01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:18.184
It never happened.

647
01:12:18.309 --> 01:12:19.810
What about him?

648
01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:23.647
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

649
01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.399
Just mail him his clothes.

650
01:13:04.522 --> 01:13:05.689
You contacting your buyer?

651
01:13:08.067 --> 01:13:09.193
Ethan.

652
01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:16.367
Ethan.

653
01:13:23.249 --> 01:13:24.208
Ethan.

654
01:13:27.253 --> 01:13:29.296
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt.

655
01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.225
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

656
01:13:43.894 --> 01:13:46.522
My contact is extremely shy.

657
01:13:49.108 --> 01:13:52.820
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders. Do you?

658
01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:55.406
Not while I'm holding this.

659
01:13:55.948 --> 01:13:57.908
<i>- Krieger...
- Ta gueule.</i>

660
01:14:03.581 --> 01:14:04.582
Don't you mean this?

661
01:14:05.749 --> 01:14:06.917
That's not the list.

662
01:14:07.626 --> 01:14:10.296
Oh, what's the matter?
You, you've never seen this trick?

663
01:14:18.596 --> 01:14:20.055
Where'd it go?

664
01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.227
It's gone.

665
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:27.855
What?

666
01:14:28.606 --> 01:14:29.607
- You.
- No.

667
01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:30.691
No?

668
01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:38.908
But not too far.

669
01:14:43.287 --> 01:14:45.748
I know what you're thinking, Krieger.

670
01:14:45.831 --> 01:14:47.666
You're thinking,
"Back in the computer room...

671
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:50.252
"I was up here, he was down there.

672
01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:54.673
"Yes, and he was...

673
01:14:55.799 --> 01:14:58.052
"He was carrying two disks. "

674
01:15:00.387 --> 01:15:02.389
It's so hard
to keep track of these things.

675
01:15:03.682 --> 01:15:04.725
Where is it?

676
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:22.451
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

677
01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.914
Try any sleight of hand with my money,
I'll cut your throat.

678
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.361
<i>You're off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?</i>

679
01:15:57.444 --> 01:15:59.655
<i>Yeah, where'd they put you up
this time, The Plaza?</i>

680
01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.115
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

681
01:16:04.076 --> 01:16:05.536
I'm so sorry.

682
01:16:12.126 --> 01:16:13.919
Krieger was my call.

683
01:16:20.718 --> 01:16:22.303
I'm sorry, Ethan.

684
01:16:27.641 --> 01:16:29.560
We did what we had to do.

685
01:16:31.437 --> 01:16:33.898
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

686
01:17:12.937 --> 01:17:14.230
Krieger did have the NOC list?

687
01:17:24.615 --> 01:17:25.908
Now I want you to hold on to it.

688
01:17:25.991 --> 01:17:27.117
What makes you trust me?

689
01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.453
Because if you knew
what you were getting into...

690
01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:30.913
you never would have done it.

691
01:17:36.877 --> 01:17:38.963
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

692
01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:42.800
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow,
on the train.

693
01:17:44.051 --> 01:17:45.886
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

694
01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:54.645
What is the range of this thing?

695
01:17:56.188 --> 01:17:58.983
It's hard to tell.
I'm gonna have to be close.

696
01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:02.153
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

697
01:18:03.863 --> 01:18:06.907
<i>The unlikely setting,
a farm in the heartland of America...</i>

698
01:18:06.991 --> 01:18:08.534
<i>the state of Wisconsin...</i>

699
01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.619
<i>where federal agents claim
to have found...</i>

700
01:18:10.703 --> 01:18:13.247
<i>the brains behind
an international drugs ring.</i>

701
01:18:13.747 --> 01:18:16.917
<i>The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt...</i>

702
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:19.253
<i>and her brother-in-law, Donald Hunt.</i>

703
01:18:19.336 --> 01:18:22.590
<i>They were arrested this morning
by drug enforcement officers...</i>

704
01:18:22.673 --> 01:18:24.175
<i>in a major sting operation...</i>

705
01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.261
<i>designed to expose
the illegal manufacture...</i>

706
01:18:27.344 --> 01:18:29.972
<i>of the drug methcathinone,
known as khat.</i>

707
01:18:30.097 --> 01:18:33.058
<i>I'm afraid what we have here is
a case of a naive and lonely widower...</i>

708
01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:33.726
Kittridge.

709
01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:04.256
Kittridge.

710
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.342
I see you've been out visiting the folks.

711
01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:08.802
It's Hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

712
01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:13.140
You've been watching a little TV,
have you?

713
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:18.604
Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

714
01:19:18.896 --> 01:19:20.648
- He's in England.
- Get Ml5.

715
01:19:21.398 --> 01:19:22.817
Ethan, I wanna assure you...

716
01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.362
that my first order of business
after you come in...

717
01:19:26.445 --> 01:19:29.907
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped...

718
01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:32.868
and eliminated completely
from their files.

719
01:19:32.952 --> 01:19:35.371
Look, if you come in now...

720
01:19:35.454 --> 01:19:38.749
<i>we can plea down
the charges against you, as well.</i>

721
01:19:40.835 --> 01:19:42.545
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

722
01:19:44.338 --> 01:19:45.673
Certainly, Ethan.

723
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:47.716
If you're dealing with someone...

724
01:19:49.134 --> 01:19:51.303
<i>who's crushed, stabbed...</i>

725
01:19:51.929 --> 01:19:54.306
shot, and detonated...

726
01:19:55.015 --> 01:19:57.852
<i>five members of his own IMF team...</i>

727
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:01.355
how devastated
do you think you're gonna make him...

728
01:20:01.438 --> 01:20:04.650
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

729
01:20:04.775 --> 01:20:07.778
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

730
01:20:11.115 --> 01:20:12.366
Lost him.

731
01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:15.536
We needed three more seconds.

732
01:20:15.619 --> 01:20:18.247
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

733
01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:33.429
You're a hard man to catch up with.

734
01:20:42.688 --> 01:20:45.483
Next day I managed to drag myself
back to the safe house.

735
01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:46.817
I must have just missed you.

736
01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:49.737
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

737
01:20:49.987 --> 01:20:51.489
And that's when you picked us up
in the States.

738
01:20:51.989 --> 01:20:54.909
But you left before I could get there,
and I could check just so many places.

739
01:20:55.326 --> 01:20:57.745
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

740
01:20:58.037 --> 01:20:59.371
So I watched Europe.

741
01:21:00.164 --> 01:21:03.209
Once you turned up in England,
it was easy.

742
01:21:04.043 --> 01:21:06.128
You knew
I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

743
01:21:06.212 --> 01:21:07.880
Hey, I showed them to you.

744
01:21:10.049 --> 01:21:11.091
I remember.

745
01:21:13.886 --> 01:21:16.514
Jim, look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

746
01:21:16.597 --> 01:21:18.891
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

747
01:21:19.016 --> 01:21:20.476
I can sit up straight.

748
01:21:21.227 --> 01:21:22.770
I just can't sit up straight very well.

749
01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:26.315
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

750
01:21:28.067 --> 01:21:29.068
Ethan...

751
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.281
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

752
01:21:36.367 --> 01:21:39.411
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge.

753
01:21:40.412 --> 01:21:42.039
Kittridge, Ethan.

754
01:21:47.628 --> 01:21:49.421
Kittridge is the mole.

755
01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:52.466
My God, of course. You're right.

756
01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:00.099
He was at the embassy that night.

757
01:22:04.562 --> 01:22:07.857
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

758
01:22:15.573 --> 01:22:17.533
He shot you on the bridge.

759
01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:48.898
<i>Ethan!</i>

760
01:23:02.703 --> 01:23:05.456
He must have had backup take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

761
01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.560
How did he do Hannah?

762
01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:54.922
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

763
01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:23.617
Why, Jim?

764
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:26.662
Why?

765
01:24:29.748 --> 01:24:31.834
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable.

766
01:24:31.917 --> 01:24:33.502
No more Cold War.

767
01:24:35.212 --> 01:24:38.048
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

768
01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:41.051
Operations, you answer
to no one but yourself.

769
01:24:41.927 --> 01:24:45.181
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is...

770
01:24:45.306 --> 01:24:47.016
running the country
without your permission.

771
01:24:48.184 --> 01:24:49.935
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

772
01:24:51.562 --> 01:24:53.647
Then you realize, it's over.

773
01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:57.067
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

774
01:24:57.193 --> 01:25:00.237
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

775
01:25:02.323 --> 01:25:03.657
Kittridge.

776
01:25:04.408 --> 01:25:07.036
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

777
01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:15.836
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

778
01:25:17.671 --> 01:25:19.882
What's gonna make him do that?

779
01:25:19.965 --> 01:25:23.344
What he didn't get in Prague.
The NOC list.

780
01:25:25.804 --> 01:25:28.808
Whoa. Jesus, Ethan.

781
01:25:30.601 --> 01:25:32.061
Good for you.

782
01:25:33.813 --> 01:25:36.899
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the TGV en route to Paris.

783
01:25:37.066 --> 01:25:39.276
Tight security. No guns.

784
01:25:39.819 --> 01:25:41.153
A real plus.

785
01:25:41.946 --> 01:25:43.948
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list
to Max...

786
01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:45.950
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

787
01:25:46.659 --> 01:25:48.786
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

788
01:25:48.869 --> 01:25:51.288
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

789
01:25:54.875 --> 01:25:55.876
Jim?

790
01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:07.471
I was in a cafe waiting for you, Ethan.

791
01:26:11.225 --> 01:26:12.434
And there she was...

792
01:26:13.978 --> 01:26:16.856
standing in the rain,
alive and beautiful...

793
01:26:17.356 --> 01:26:18.816
thinking I'm dead and gone.

794
01:26:22.945 --> 01:26:25.489
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me...

795
01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:27.533
to keep going, get the job done.

796
01:26:32.496 --> 01:26:33.914
She can't know about me, Ethan.

797
01:26:34.039 --> 01:26:36.208
No one can, not till this is over.

798
01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:37.918
You're probably right.

799
01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:41.046
There's too much at stake.

800
01:26:43.674 --> 01:26:46.427
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

801
01:26:48.387 --> 01:26:51.140
- I'll call you from Paris.
- You got it.

802
01:27:14.955 --> 01:27:15.956
What happened?

803
01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:21.795
I sent the message to Max.

804
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:27.760
We're on for tomorrow.

805
01:27:35.976 --> 01:27:36.977
Okay.

806
01:27:47.613 --> 01:27:48.572
Come here.

807
01:28:31.157 --> 01:28:32.199
Sir.

808
01:28:33.159 --> 01:28:34.994
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

809
01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:37.705
X- ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

810
01:28:49.258 --> 01:28:50.301
Gene?

811
01:28:55.723 --> 01:28:58.476
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

812
01:28:58.601 --> 01:29:00.102
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

813
01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.892
<i>- Yes?
- Give me Max.</i>

814
01:29:41.018 --> 01:29:42.019
It's him.

815
01:29:45.815 --> 01:29:47.650
This was not what we discussed.

816
01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:50.444
<i>My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.</i>

817
01:29:50.778 --> 01:29:52.738
<i>There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.</i>

818
01:29:52.863 --> 01:29:54.323
<i>Tear it away, you'll find the disk.</i>

819
01:30:29.567 --> 01:30:31.152
Dear boy...

820
01:30:32.695 --> 01:30:36.115
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

821
01:30:36.282 --> 01:30:38.159
<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

822
01:30:38.951 --> 01:30:41.787
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

823
01:30:41.912 --> 01:30:44.039
Baggage car, rack 3.

824
01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:47.877
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

825
01:30:48.544 --> 01:30:50.087
<i>What about Job?</i>

826
01:30:50.171 --> 01:30:53.716
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

827
01:31:11.567 --> 01:31:13.194
What's the matter?

828
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.821
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

829
01:31:15.946 --> 01:31:19.033
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the Chunnel.

830
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:34.381
- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

831
01:31:35.424 --> 01:31:38.093
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

832
01:31:38.219 --> 01:31:40.304
I always check the batteries.

833
01:31:40.387 --> 01:31:43.015
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

834
01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:48.979
This is bullshit.

835
01:31:49.063 --> 01:31:50.731
We don't even know
what Max looks like.

836
01:31:51.023 --> 01:31:52.691
Look, we don't need to know.

837
01:31:53.067 --> 01:31:54.902
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

838
01:31:55.027 --> 01:31:56.237
And that means laptops.

839
01:32:08.249 --> 01:32:10.876
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

840
01:32:11.001 --> 01:32:13.212
Hello? Hello?

841
01:32:14.797 --> 01:32:16.632
I can't hear anything.

842
01:32:17.591 --> 01:32:20.469
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's just the battery is gone.

843
01:32:20.594 --> 01:32:21.971
It's working.

844
01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:36.193
He's in the baggage car.

845
01:32:38.028 --> 01:32:40.322
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.

846
01:32:40.447 --> 01:32:41.699
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

847
01:32:41.824 --> 01:32:43.909
<i>The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.</i>

848
01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.469
Barnes?

849
01:33:40.674 --> 01:33:42.092
Ethan's right behind me.

850
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:47.890
Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

851
01:33:52.394 --> 01:33:53.562
Kittridge is here.

852
01:33:57.858 --> 01:33:58.859
We take the money.

853
01:34:00.027 --> 01:34:01.487
Ethan takes the blame.

854
01:34:04.281 --> 01:34:05.991
No one else has seen you alive.

855
01:34:09.119 --> 01:34:11.413
No one will believe him.

856
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:40.401
Of course...

857
01:34:40.484 --> 01:34:43.279
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

858
01:34:47.158 --> 01:34:48.868
- Ethan.
- Yes.

859
01:34:50.369 --> 01:34:53.455
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

860
01:34:55.833 --> 01:34:58.419
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

861
01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.966
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

862
01:35:04.049 --> 01:35:05.259
Mind telling me, Ethan?

863
01:35:06.594 --> 01:35:08.262
Before or after I showed up in London?

864
01:35:10.055 --> 01:35:11.515
Before London...

865
01:35:11.807 --> 01:35:14.685
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

866
01:35:16.228 --> 01:35:19.315
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.

867
01:35:21.358 --> 01:35:24.612
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

868
01:35:24.737 --> 01:35:27.615
Why the masquerade?
Why take the risk?

869
01:35:28.491 --> 01:35:31.410
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

870
01:35:32.453 --> 01:35:33.621
And you are the answer.

871
01:35:35.206 --> 01:35:36.665
I knew about Jim.

872
01:35:36.999 --> 01:35:38.501
But he didn't know about you.

873
01:35:39.793 --> 01:35:41.212
In all fairness, Ethan...

874
01:35:41.295 --> 01:35:44.048
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

875
01:35:45.257 --> 01:35:48.802
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.

876
01:35:51.305 --> 01:35:56.268
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife," Ethan.

877
01:35:58.062 --> 01:36:00.481
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

878
01:36:00.606 --> 01:36:01.774
Yes, let's get the money.

879
01:36:02.942 --> 01:36:05.986
Ethan, the money.

880
01:36:08.656 --> 01:36:09.740
Give her the money.

881
01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:14.954
You've earned it.

882
01:36:22.795 --> 01:36:24.421
All $10 million.

883
01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:27.675
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

884
01:36:28.259 --> 01:36:29.218
Oh?

885
01:36:29.969 --> 01:36:30.970
What's that?

886
01:36:50.406 --> 01:36:52.074
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

887
01:36:54.034 --> 01:36:56.495
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

888
01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.750
You son of a bitch.

889
01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:03.210
It's over, Jim.

890
01:37:10.134 --> 01:37:12.761
Don't. Don't, Jim.

891
01:37:12.887 --> 01:37:13.846
"Don't, Jim. "

892
01:40:24.829 --> 01:40:25.788
Damn!

893
01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:31.085
No, it's in the tunnel!

894
01:40:31.877 --> 01:40:34.004
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

895
01:40:34.088 --> 01:40:35.965
Accelerate! Accelerate!

896
01:42:37.837 --> 01:42:39.171
Red light!

897
01:42:40.422 --> 01:42:41.757
Green light!

898
01:43:30.097 --> 01:43:34.435
Look, we cannot just be
sitting around, okay? We need...

899
01:43:34.518 --> 01:43:36.312
I think this is what you're looking for.

900
01:43:43.277 --> 01:43:44.695
Hello, Max.

901
01:43:45.654 --> 01:43:48.657
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

902
01:43:48.782 --> 01:43:51.368
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

903
01:43:51.494 --> 01:43:54.788
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

904
01:43:57.541 --> 01:44:02.129
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

905
01:44:02.505 --> 01:44:03.839
<i>In a freak accident...</i>

906
01:44:03.923 --> 01:44:07.343
<i>a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel...</i>

907
01:44:07.426 --> 01:44:11.555
<i>and collided with a high-speed train
on its way from London to Paris.</i>

908
01:44:12.014 --> 01:44:15.601
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.</i>

909
01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.688
<i>Authorities have attributed the accident
to instrument failure.</i>

910
01:44:19.772 --> 01:44:22.566
Reach your folks? How are they feeling?

911
01:44:22.691 --> 01:44:24.068
About what?

912
01:44:24.318 --> 01:44:27.905
The apology from
the Justice Department, VIP treatment...

913
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:30.282
you know, the whole nine yards.

914
01:44:30.866 --> 01:44:32.910
Well, my mom was a little confused...

915
01:44:33.035 --> 01:44:35.579
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald...

916
01:44:35.704 --> 01:44:38.123
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

917
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.378
Cheers.

918
01:44:43.963 --> 01:44:47.424
To you, Luther,
for being off the disavowed list.

919
01:44:47.508 --> 01:44:48.968
Hey, I'm the flavor of the month.

920
01:44:52.596 --> 01:44:53.931
Why don't you come back with me?

921
01:44:56.851 --> 01:44:58.227
I just...

922
01:44:58.602 --> 01:45:00.312
I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

923
01:45:03.274 --> 01:45:05.276
Gotta go catch my flight.

924
01:45:06.485 --> 01:45:08.445
So how's it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

925
01:45:11.115 --> 01:45:12.741
Man, I don't know.

926
01:45:14.827 --> 01:45:16.620
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

927
01:45:17.496 --> 01:45:20.207
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better...

928
01:45:20.332 --> 01:45:21.625
I'll always think of you that way.

929
01:45:33.512 --> 01:45:35.264
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

930
01:45:36.932 --> 01:45:38.350
Would you like to watch a movie?

931
01:45:42.521 --> 01:45:43.981
No, thank you.

932
01:45:44.273 --> 01:45:46.692
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

933
01:45:49.445 --> 01:45:50.946
Aruba, perhaps?
