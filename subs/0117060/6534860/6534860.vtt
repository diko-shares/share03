00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.929
<i>It was good...</i>

2
00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:29.821
<i>that you called us.</i>

3
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.867
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

4
00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:37.865
<i>We were at the bar...</i>

5
00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.116
<i>drinking...</i>

6
00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:43.957
<i>having fun...</i>

7
00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:46.673
<i>I don't even know...</i>

8
00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:50.335
<i>how I got here.</i>

9
00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:54.976
Come on. She's been under too long.

10
00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:57.933
<i>You're the only one who can help me.</i>

11
00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:06.023
<i>Come one... come on.</i>

12
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.529
<i>Tell me what I need to know.</i>

13
00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:09.858
<i>Come on.</i>

14
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.073
<i>They'll kill me.</i>

15
00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:17.125
<i>You asked for my help.</i>

16
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:20.460
<i>Come on.</i>

17
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.126
Come on.

18
00:01:25.262 --> 00:01:26.591
<i>The contact in Minsk...</i>

19
00:01:26.764 --> 00:01:29.089
The name, pal. Give us the name.

20
00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.596
<i>Dimitri...</i>

21
00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:34.601
<i>Miediev.</i>

22
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:50.578
<i>What now?</i>

23
00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:53.992
<i>Now we drink.</i>

24
00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:56.165
Za druziye.

25
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.606
Get rid of that scum.

26
00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:31.915
Come on...

27
00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.616
- Did we get it?
- We got it.

28
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:58.845
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Rosen?

29
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:00.104
No, thank you.

30
00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:08.277
Would you like
to watch a movie, Mr Phelps?

31
00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:10.491
No. I prefer the theatre.

32
00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.828
Would you consider
the cinema of the Ukraine?

33
00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:17.705
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

34
00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:23.089
Thank you.

35
00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:49.621
<i>Good morning, Mr Phelps.</i>

36
00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:52.663
<i>The man you're looking
at is Alexander Golitsyn,</i>

37
00:04:52.754 --> 00:04:55.459
<i>an attache at our embassy
in Prague.</i>

38
00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:58.004
<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

39
00:04:58.092 --> 00:05:01.260
<i>He has stolen half
of a CIA NOC list -</i>

40
00:05:01.347 --> 00:05:05.048
<i>a record of all our deep-cover
agents in Eastern Europe.</i>

41
00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:09.271
<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

42
00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:13.354
<i>The portion that Golitsyn
already has contains code names,</i>

43
00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:15.568
<i>but it is useless without its mate,</i>

44
00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:19.155
<i>which matches the code names
with their true names.</i>

45
00:05:19.243 --> 00:05:23.193
<i>It is this half which Golitsyn
plans to steal from the embassy</i>

46
00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.116
<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

47
00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:28.162
<i>Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

48
00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:31.373
<i>is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft,</i>

49
00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.879
<i>shadow Golitsyn to his buyer
and apprehend them both.</i>

50
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:39.838
<i>We've already dispatched a team
selected from your usual group.</i>

51
00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:41.972
<i>Sarah Davies is already undercover,</i>

52
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.848
<i>Jack Harmon can hack
into any security system,</i>

53
00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.561
<i>Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance,</i>

54
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:50.272
<i>your wife Claire
will cover transport...</i>

55
00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:54.028
<i>and Ethan Hunt
will be your point man as usual.</i>

56
00:05:54.117 --> 00:05:59.075
<i>He will rendezvous in Prague
at a safe house of your choosing.</i>

57
00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:04.077
<i>As always, should any member
of IM Force be caught or killed</i>

58
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.836
<i>the secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

59
00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:12.136
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds. Good luck, Jim.</i>

60
00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.459
A very straightforward objective:

61
00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:39.867
we photograph Golitsyn
stealing the NOC list,

62
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:42.452
follow him to his buyer,

63
00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:44.873
apprehend both of them.

64
00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.876
Now here's the plot.

65
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.754
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character during a party.

66
00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.138
Hide in plain sight -
highest possible profile.

67
00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:56.846
- Are you game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

68
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.106
Sarah, you're at the party already

69
00:07:00.193 --> 00:07:02.351
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

70
00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:05.483
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

71
00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:06.986
I have nothing to wear.

72
00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:11.160
Well, you'll work it out.

73
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:14.535
You'll mark Golitsyn,
hand him to Hannah.

74
00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:17.877
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

75
00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:19.079
Stay on him.

76
00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:20.170
No problem.

77
00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.587
- Jack.
- Yeah?

78
00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:23.254
Fingerprint security.

79
00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:25.671
There's access through
the elevator shaft here.

80
00:07:25.765 --> 00:07:30.012
- So I'm not wearing my tux?
- Open, close, get out.

81
00:07:30.103 --> 00:07:32.475
Zero residual presence.

82
00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:35.769
Claire, you'll cover outside
in the vehicle.

83
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.731
Hannah will join you
as Golitsyn goes exterior.

84
00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:41.657
- Stay on him from there.
- OK.

85
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.526
Anything goes wrong, I call abort -
everybody walk away, immediately.

86
00:07:46.998 --> 00:07:49.953
Regroup here at 4 a.m. That's 0400.

87
00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:51.912
Any questions?

88
00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:59.212
Yeah. Can we get a cappuccino
machine? What do you call this?

89
00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:03.052
- I call it cruel and unusual.
- I made that coffee.

90
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:08.350
Exactly. It's even worse
than the sludge you made in Kiev.

91
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.013
Take it easy on my wife's coffee.

92
00:08:11.109 --> 00:08:14.645
- We missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- You, too, Ethan.

93
00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:18.867
- On one of your cushy assignments?
- Where this time? The Plaza?

94
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:20.861
Drake Hotel, Chicago.

95
00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:22.117
Ooh!

96
00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:24.780
Cushy! 24-hour room service.

97
00:08:24.876 --> 00:08:27.248
- Chauffeured cars.
- Fat expense account.

98
00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:30.338
- He's getting soft.
- Yeah, look at him.

99
00:08:31.424 --> 00:08:34.924
OK, listen. If that list
gets out into the open,

100
00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:40.090
the names of our agents in Eastern
Europe go to the highest bidders -

101
00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:43.305
Third World terrorists,
arms dealers, drug lords,

102
00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:47.817
anybody who'd love to get rid
of long-term coverts like us.

103
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:51.603
If they're exposed,
they'll be executed.

104
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:57.364
So, I'll run the show from here.
Everyone knows their roles.

105
00:08:57.455 --> 00:08:59.364
Let's punch out the details.

106
00:08:59.457 --> 00:09:02.126
There's a camera
built right into the bridge.

107
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.506
Whatever you see,
it sees and transmits back here.

108
00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:10.885
- See? Can you hear me?
- Of course I can hear you.

109
00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:13.888
No, in your...
oh, you need an earpiece.

110
00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:14.969
Oh.

111
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.974
You have lovely eyes.
Can you hear me now?

112
00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:22.181
Loud and clear.

113
00:09:22.276 --> 00:09:27.022
If he has a car waiting and rolls,
stay with him no matter what.

114
00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:30.815
You should take the afternoon,
drive the streets around this quarter.

115
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.659
- They're confusing.
- What do you think I've been doing?

116
00:09:34.747 --> 00:09:36.706
We're using Waltzer?

117
00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:38.121
He's our guy.

118
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.912
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

119
00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:43.287
Not this week.

120
00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:47.678
This week, he's fishing at the
Oughterard Slough in County Kildare

121
00:09:47.763 --> 00:09:50.136
with one of our best Irish guides.

122
00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:53.096
Yup. And he won't be back
any time soon.

123
00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:57.684
<i>..Irrelevant at best,
or unconstitutional at worst.</i>

124
00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:02.402
<i>With respect, Senator, it sounds
as if you want the kind of charge</i>

125
00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:05.941
<i>that Senator Frank Church
led in the 1970s</i>

126
00:10:06.035 --> 00:10:09.985
<i>and to destroy the intelligence
capability of this country.</i>

127
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.703
<i>I want to know
who these people are</i>

128
00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.915
<i>and how they're spending
taxpayers' money.</i>

129
00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:18.705
<i>We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.</i>

130
00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:21.876
Stick of gum, right?

131
00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:22.965
No?

132
00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.296
No. Red light, green light.

133
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.309
You come up against
a lock you can't pick,

134
00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.932
you mash them together -

135
00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:33.727
Hasta lasagne,
don't get any on ya.

136
00:10:33.816 --> 00:10:35.975
You'll have about five seconds.

137
00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.861
Just don't chew it.

138
00:11:18.202 --> 00:11:21.867
Ethan, Jack's inside. Let's go.

139
00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:29.125
<i>Senator. I'm Rand Housman,
the Ambassador's aide.</i>

140
00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:31.457
<i>- Hello, Mr Housman.
- How was the opera?</i>

141
00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:34.042
Uh, it was boring.

142
00:11:34.137 --> 00:11:37.554
Let me steer you
through this reception line.

143
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:49.569
<i>- How do you do, Senator?
- Mrs Reed.</i>

144
00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:52.027
Windows open by 2300.

145
00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:56.904
Petr Brandl, the Mayor of Prague,
and Mrs Brandl.

146
00:11:56.998 --> 00:12:00.699
Oh! I bet you don't remember me,
do you?

147
00:12:00.793 --> 00:12:03.166
Of course. How are you, Miss Norman?

148
00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:05.543
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

149
00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.469
Mr Golitsyn, nice to see you.

150
00:12:14.976 --> 00:12:16.803
Hannah...

151
00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:21.393
<i>Pull the shade.</i>

152
00:12:30.787 --> 00:12:33.574
<i>Sarah,
mark the package and go to two.</i>

153
00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:42.332
Your advance team mentioned
you'd like a tour.

154
00:12:42.425 --> 00:12:45.925
I've set one up.
Excuse me. This way.

155
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.095
Jesus!

156
00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:59.151
Oh, great.

157
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.810
..Which leads to the denied area,

158
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.192
the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

159
00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:31.349
Governor's in position now.

160
00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:43.781
- Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:47.739
As you can see, there's a Marine guard
and video surveillance...

162
00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:51.963
This place is like... excuse me.
I'm sorry. It's here somewhere.

163
00:13:52.048 --> 00:13:55.084
Sergeant, why are you not
in uniform this evening?

164
00:13:55.176 --> 00:14:00.599
<i>Uh, we've been ordered to wear
civilian clothes this evening, sir.</i>

165
00:14:01.684 --> 00:14:03.143
Be right back.

166
00:14:04.646 --> 00:14:07.730
Senator, is anyone
on your staff named Jack?

167
00:14:08.817 --> 00:14:11.771
Jack? Uh, we did have a Jack.

168
00:14:11.862 --> 00:14:13.939
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall -

169
00:14:14.032 --> 00:14:17.116
constantly late
and behind in his work.

170
00:14:20.122 --> 00:14:23.408
<i>We were forced to tie him
behind a stallion</i>

171
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:26.455
<i>and drag him around for a few days.</i>

172
00:14:26.545 --> 00:14:28.787
Relax your crack. I'm working on it.

173
00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:45.767
Sorry, sir.
Thank you. Have a nice evening.

174
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.900
Thank you. Ah.

175
00:14:58.249 --> 00:15:01.620
That date with Sarah
is definitely off.

176
00:15:31.122 --> 00:15:32.118
Higher.

177
00:15:37.128 --> 00:15:39.584
He's heading to the denied area.

178
00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:44.844
Get moving, Ethan.
He's rolling to you.

179
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.645
Jack.

180
00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:01.029
Jack, we're in position here.

181
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.196
<i>Jack.</i>

182
00:16:03.284 --> 00:16:05.028
I didn't touch it.

183
00:16:07.413 --> 00:16:10.451
- Where's my coat?
- Jack, open the doors.

184
00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:23.052
He's in the box, Ethan.

185
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.553
- OK. Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

186
00:16:29.897 --> 00:16:32.140
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

187
00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:35.608
Go!

188
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.321
He's got it.

189
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.690
All right.

190
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:19.827
Saved your ass again, Jack.

191
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.955
<i>Give me a break, pops.</i>

192
00:17:22.043 --> 00:17:23.537
Such a nice ass.

193
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.787
And a lonely ass.

194
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.754
Transport in five minutes.

195
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.465
Yes, indeed.

196
00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:15.008
Jack, we're in position. Open
the doors and let the package roll.

197
00:18:15.104 --> 00:18:17.855
Roger that. Opening doors now.

198
00:18:18.941 --> 00:18:20.401
Stairway, you're wrapped.

199
00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:22.111
<i>Go to transport.</i>

200
00:18:28.077 --> 00:18:29.073
Hey.

201
00:18:31.832 --> 00:18:34.287
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Nothing!

202
00:18:40.383 --> 00:18:42.293
I don't have control, Jack.

203
00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:45.256
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

204
00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:50.092
- Cut the power.
- Come on, Jack.

205
00:18:51.187 --> 00:18:53.228
Cut the power. Jack?

206
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.181
Jack?

207
00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:03.736
Jack?

208
00:19:05.704 --> 00:19:06.701
Jack?

209
00:19:08.624 --> 00:19:09.620
Jack?

210
00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:14.086
<i>Jack, do you copy? Jack?</i>

211
00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:17.542
Man down, Ethan. Man down.

212
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:39.031
<i>Ethan, stay where you are.</i>

213
00:19:39.118 --> 00:19:41.526
I'm coming to you.

214
00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:58.386
The package is in the open.

215
00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:03.016
Jim.

216
00:20:04.481 --> 00:20:07.731
<i>- He's in the open.
- En route.</i>

217
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:29.089
Jim, he's in the open.

218
00:20:29.969 --> 00:20:32.590
Jim, the package is in the open.

219
00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:39.852
- I've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

220
00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:41.848
No. Abort.

221
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:43.602
He's out of pocket.

222
00:20:48.073 --> 00:20:49.733
I can't do that.

223
00:20:49.825 --> 00:20:52.779
We're being ambushed, Ethan.
Abort. That's an order.

224
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.410
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

225
00:20:55.499 --> 00:20:58.037
<i>No, damn it! No! I said abort!</i>

226
00:21:07.971 --> 00:21:10.641
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming.

227
00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:13.014
Jim gave an abort. Walk away.

228
00:21:13.102 --> 00:21:17.397
We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

229
00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:18.893
Now, go!

230
00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:51.979
Where are you?

231
00:21:52.064 --> 00:21:54.057
About 200 yards from the bridge.

232
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.693
<i>They're covering this frequency.</i>

233
00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:57.320
Cut all radio communication.

234
00:21:57.405 --> 00:22:01.237
<i>Repeat -
cut all radio communication.</i>

235
00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:26.892
<i>Ethan!</i>

236
00:22:33.696 --> 00:22:34.693
<i>Ethan...</i>

237
00:22:59.935 --> 00:23:01.216
Sarah...

238
00:23:01.312 --> 00:23:04.266
Abort. Repeat - abort.

239
00:23:07.527 --> 00:23:10.279
Abort! Do you read me?

240
00:23:14.744 --> 00:23:17.070
Sarah? God!

241
00:23:47.491 --> 00:23:48.689
Claire.

242
00:23:48.784 --> 00:23:52.449
Oh, my God! My God!

243
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:43.678
Oh, no... Sarah...

244
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.116
<i>Satcom seven.</i>

245
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:44.288
Central Europe, unsecured.

246
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:46.036
<i>Designator?</i>

247
00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:48.253
Bravo Echo One One.

248
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.336
<i>Switching.</i>

249
00:25:50.926 --> 00:25:52.420
<i>This is Kittridge.</i>

250
00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:54.053
Go secure.

251
00:25:54.138 --> 00:25:55.513
<i>OK. Go ahead.</i>

252
00:25:57.142 --> 00:25:59.051
This is Ethan Hunt.

253
00:25:59.144 --> 00:26:01.267
They're dead.

254
00:26:01.354 --> 00:26:02.849
<i>What... who's dead?</i>

255
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.980
My team. My team is dead!

256
00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:06.063
<i>Jesus.</i>

257
00:26:06.152 --> 00:26:07.267
Golitsyn's gone.

258
00:26:07.362 --> 00:26:12.357
They knew we were coming, man.
They knew and the disk is gone.

259
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:15.701
<i>- Are you intact?
- It's gone. Do you read me?</i>

260
00:26:15.787 --> 00:26:19.573
- The list is in the open!
- I read you.

261
00:26:19.668 --> 00:26:23.452
<i>Let's bring you in safely,
then we'll worry about that, OK?</i>

262
00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:24.626
<i>Were you followed?</i>

263
00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:28.593
I don't think so.

264
00:26:28.678 --> 00:26:32.094
<i>Don't think.
Be sure. Are you clean?</i>

265
00:26:32.182 --> 00:26:33.297
Yes.

266
00:26:34.518 --> 00:26:38.683
<i>OK. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

267
00:26:38.774 --> 00:26:40.398
You're in Prague?

268
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:42.275
<i>One hour.</i>

269
00:27:38.134 --> 00:27:40.092
I, uh...

270
00:27:40.178 --> 00:27:43.843
I can't tell you how,
er... sorry I am.

271
00:27:43.932 --> 00:27:48.261
I know how much Jim in particular
meant to you, Ethan,

272
00:27:48.353 --> 00:27:51.356
personally
as well as professionally.

273
00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:53.772
Yeah.

274
00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:01.984
Here's a passport, visa.
Usual drill.

275
00:28:02.078 --> 00:28:05.911
We'll work exfiltration through
Canada, debrief you at Langley.

276
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.414
Throw the Prague police a bone
or two. Toss them a few suspects.

277
00:28:15.135 --> 00:28:16.333
You follow me?

278
00:28:18.388 --> 00:28:20.881
Yeah, I follow.

279
00:28:20.976 --> 00:28:24.475
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

280
00:28:24.563 --> 00:28:27.766
You mean, I'VE lost
enough agents for one night.

281
00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:32.694
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

282
00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:35.069
Who else is left?

283
00:28:37.203 --> 00:28:40.738
Yeah. I see your point.

284
00:28:45.337 --> 00:28:47.045
Why was there another team?

285
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.085
What?

286
00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:53.543
Of IMF agents
at the embassy, tonight.

287
00:28:55.766 --> 00:28:57.509
I don't quite follow you.

288
00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:03.474
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

289
00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:07.102
The drunk Russians
on the embankment at 7, 8 o'clock.

290
00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:13.155
The couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at 9 and 11.

291
00:29:13.245 --> 00:29:16.080
The waiter standing
behind Hannah at the stairs -

292
00:29:16.164 --> 00:29:18.406
bow tie, 12.00.

293
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.577
The other IMF team.

294
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.042
You're worried about me. Why?

295
00:29:26.593 --> 00:29:28.716
Well, for a little over two years,

296
00:29:28.804 --> 00:29:32.304
we've been spotting
serious blowback in IMF operations.

297
00:29:32.392 --> 00:29:34.598
We have a penetration.

298
00:29:34.686 --> 00:29:37.557
The other day, we decoded a message
on the Internet

299
00:29:37.648 --> 00:29:39.724
from a Czech we know as "Max".

300
00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:40.814
The arms dealer.

301
00:29:41.987 --> 00:29:43.315
That's right.

302
00:29:43.405 --> 00:29:46.690
Max, it seems,
has two unique gifts...

303
00:29:46.783 --> 00:29:48.859
a capacity for anonymity

304
00:29:48.952 --> 00:29:51.159
and for corrupting
susceptible agents.

305
00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:54.284
This time, he'd gotten
to someone on the inside.

306
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:57.827
He'd gotten in a position
to buy our NOC list.

307
00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:01.291
An operation he referred to
as Job 314,

308
00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:03.958
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

309
00:30:07.223 --> 00:30:09.894
But the list Golitsyn stole
was a decoy.

310
00:30:09.977 --> 00:30:13.892
That's correct. The actual list
is secure at Langley.

311
00:30:13.982 --> 00:30:16.983
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
One of ours.

312
00:30:19.196 --> 00:30:23.527
This whole operation
was a mole hunt.

313
00:30:29.374 --> 00:30:32.376
This whole operation
was a mole hunt.

314
00:30:32.462 --> 00:30:33.873
Yeah.

315
00:30:35.757 --> 00:30:40.468
The mole's deep inside...

316
00:30:40.555 --> 00:30:42.714
and like you said...

317
00:30:45.685 --> 00:30:47.429
you survived.

318
00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:53.067
I want to show you something, Ethan.

319
00:30:54.988 --> 00:30:56.531
Since your father's death,

320
00:30:56.615 --> 00:31:00.316
your family's farm
has been in receivership,

321
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.326
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

322
00:31:04.415 --> 00:31:08.330
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

323
00:31:08.419 --> 00:31:14.258
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be an expensive proposition.

324
00:31:15.804 --> 00:31:17.796
So...

325
00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:22.184
why don't we quietly
get out of here and onto a plane?

326
00:31:25.232 --> 00:31:27.106
I understand you're upset.

327
00:31:27.192 --> 00:31:30.229
Kittridge,
you've never seen me upset.

328
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.859
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

329
00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:35.274
You have bribed, cajoled,
and killed,

330
00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.693
and you've done it from the inside.

331
00:31:37.787 --> 00:31:41.490
You want to court the devil, fine.
Do it in hell.

332
00:33:43.225 --> 00:33:46.346
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

333

what are you doing?

345
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:40.327
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you... on the bridge...

346
00:37:40.418 --> 00:37:42.327

Don't move.

351
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:03.394
Ethan...

352
00:38:03.486 --> 00:38:04.684
Ethan, it's OK.

353
00:38:04.779 --> 00:38:09.941
Just calm down.
It's Claire. It's OK.

354
00:38:10.036 --> 00:38:11.945
You were in the car.

355
00:38:12.038 --> 00:38:13.746
No, I wasn't.

356
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.161
I heard on the radio...

357
00:38:17.294 --> 00:38:21.163
Shut up! I saw you.
You were in the car.

358
00:38:21.258 --> 00:38:23.546
No, I got out of the car.

359
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:26.590
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was...

360
00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:31.343
Don't give me that. I was there.
There was nobody on the bridge.

361
00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:34.935
- What happened to Jim?
- Wake up! Jim's dead!

362
00:38:35.022 --> 00:38:37.064
They're dead! They're all dead!

363
00:38:44.868 --> 00:38:48.072
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead...

364
00:38:48.163 --> 00:38:51.368
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

365
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:53.369
Take off your coat.

366
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.965
Where were you, huh?

367
00:39:03.055 --> 00:39:07.636
- I...
- Huh? Where were you?

368
00:39:08.855 --> 00:39:12.983
I walked away. He said abort.
I just... walked away.

369
00:39:13.067 --> 00:39:16.021
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

370
00:39:16.112 --> 00:39:18.984
- Did they send you?
- Who's "they"?

371
00:39:20.534 --> 00:39:24.284
- Look, who sent you?
- No one sent me.

372
00:39:24.372 --> 00:39:27.992
We were supposed to be back here
at four o'clock.

373
00:39:28.085 --> 00:39:32.166
If we abort, we don't return
here until 4.00, 0400, 4 a.m...

374
00:39:32.256 --> 00:39:35.174
4 o'clock, Ethan. 4.00...

375
00:39:35.259 --> 00:39:39.176
If we abort... 4 a.m...

376
00:39:58.704 --> 00:40:00.863
I've been disavowed.

377
00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:10.374
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

378
00:40:16.474 --> 00:40:20.389
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

379
00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:23.434
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing

380
00:40:23.525 --> 00:40:27.273
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max,

381
00:40:27.362 --> 00:40:31.408
for the last two years...
to get him our NOC list.

382
00:40:31.701 --> 00:40:36.659
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get it for him.

383
00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:40.867
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

384
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:46.712
Whoever the mole is
goes by the name of Job.

385
00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:51.844
I can't find him,
but if he knows I have the NOC list,

386
00:40:51.932 --> 00:40:53.261
he'll find me.

387
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:58.513
I'm going in and telling Kittridge
you had nothing to do with this.

388
00:40:58.608 --> 00:41:04.693
Claire, if you're not dead,
he's going to assume you're with me.

389
00:41:19.548 --> 00:41:21.837
The message is for Job.

390
00:41:23.636 --> 00:41:25.179
That's right...

391
00:41:25.263 --> 00:41:27.801
and I'm going to answer it.

392
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:55.747
Excuse me.
Can I trouble you for a match?

393
00:42:11.776 --> 00:42:14.148
Could you remove your hat, please?

394
00:42:17.198 --> 00:42:18.277
Why?

395
00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:20.573
You wish to meet Max?

396
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:23.152
The price of admission.

397
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:35.175
I thought I was going to see Max.

398
00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:38.381
You misunderstood. No one sees Max.

399
00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:41.640
Then what the hell am I doing here?

400
00:42:41.727 --> 00:42:46.354
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

401
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:49.110
I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

402
00:42:49.193 --> 00:42:52.314
If Max doesn't like
what you have to say,

403
00:42:52.406 --> 00:42:55.989
you'll be wearing that shroud
indefinitely.

404
00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:59.661
I'm willing to take the chance.

405
00:43:04.795 --> 00:43:06.373
Very well.

406
00:43:09.635 --> 00:43:15.140
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

407
00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:18.640
I need $150,000.

408
00:43:18.728 --> 00:43:21.600
Oh, really?

409
00:43:25.152 --> 00:43:26.148
You... you...

410
00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:30.651
You thought if you simply
showed up, I might give it to you?

411
00:43:31.827 --> 00:43:34.579
Why not? You gave Job 125.

412
00:43:36.123 --> 00:43:41.629
Hmm... the penny drops.
You are not Job.

413
00:43:41.797 --> 00:43:48.132
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

414
00:43:48.221 --> 00:43:50.428
Then there was its tone,

415
00:43:50.516 --> 00:43:53.137
aggressive but playful.

416
00:43:53.227 --> 00:43:55.219
Job is not playful.

417
00:43:56.397 --> 00:44:00.479
So you are something of a paradox.

418
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.230
Well, that depends.

419
00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:03.317
On what?

420
00:44:03.406 --> 00:44:05.979
Whether you like a paradox.

421
00:44:08.035 --> 00:44:11.121
I want $150,000 today.

422
00:44:11.206 --> 00:44:13.115
That's quite out of the question.

423
00:44:15.878 --> 00:44:17.752
The disk Job sold you...

424
00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:19.582
it's worthless.

425
00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:22.925
It's bait...
part of an internal mole hunt.

426
00:44:28.017 --> 00:44:30.557
And how might you know that?

427
00:44:32.064 --> 00:44:34.390
Are you another company man?

428
00:44:36.652 --> 00:44:38.063
Like Job?

429
00:44:38.154 --> 00:44:39.613
Hmm...

430
00:44:41.617 --> 00:44:44.190
We're asking about you.

431
00:44:45.496 --> 00:44:47.240
I'm NOC...

432
00:44:47.332 --> 00:44:50.867
Was... Now disavowed.

433
00:44:50.961 --> 00:44:53.631
Why, may I ask?

434
00:44:53.714 --> 00:44:56.881
That is the question
I want to ask Job.

435
00:44:56.967 --> 00:45:02.343
I don't know Job
any more than Job knows me.

436
00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.761
Even so...

437
00:45:03.851 --> 00:45:06.389
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.

438
00:45:06.479 --> 00:45:07.890
Why should I?

439
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.352
I can deliver the actual NOC list.

440
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.933
The one you have is worthless

441
00:45:13.028 --> 00:45:16.564
and certain to have a homing device
to pinpoint your location.

442
00:45:16.658 --> 00:45:17.772
Mm-hmm.

443
00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:21.033
Mm-hmm...

444
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:23.114
Boot it up.

445
00:45:23.207 --> 00:45:25.116
In 30 seconds to 10 minutes,

446
00:45:25.209 --> 00:45:28.660
you'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like rabbits.

447
00:45:30.256 --> 00:45:33.757
It's easy
to say the disk is worthless

448
00:45:33.844 --> 00:45:37.842
when you say I can't look
and see if it's worthless.

449
00:45:37.932 --> 00:45:40.055
Not a tenable position, sir.

450
00:45:41.436 --> 00:45:44.307
OK. Use it, but...

451
00:45:45.399 --> 00:45:48.235
I'd suggest you pack first.

452
00:46:03.379 --> 00:46:05.917
26-27. So far, so good.

453
00:46:06.007 --> 00:46:08.545
Not so good for you, my friend.

454
00:46:08.634 --> 00:46:11.006
I'd say you've got
about two minutes.

455
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.126
32 and 33.

456
00:46:45.218 --> 00:46:48.505
Doesn't mean a signal.
Could just be heating up.

457
00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:57.395
44 and 45.

458
00:47:12.876 --> 00:47:13.872
Now.

459
00:47:46.498 --> 00:47:48.040
Man's gone black, Barnes.

460
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:51.874
He's under
until he decides to surface.

461
00:47:51.963 --> 00:47:55.712
We'll involve the local authorities.
Cut off his transportation.

462
00:47:55.801 --> 00:47:58.292
What can we do, Barnes?

463
00:47:58.429 --> 00:48:02.972
Put a guy at the airport? How many
identities do you think Hunt has?

464
00:48:03.059 --> 00:48:07.058
How many times has he slipped past
customs in how many countries?

465
00:48:07.148 --> 00:48:09.436
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

466
00:48:09.525 --> 00:48:13.394
- We taught them, for Christ's sake.
- What do you suggest?

467
00:48:15.574 --> 00:48:19.618
Let's not waste time chasing him.
Let's make him come to us.

468
00:48:19.703 --> 00:48:21.578
Everybody has pressure points,
Barnes.

469
00:48:21.664 --> 00:48:26.908
You find something that's personally
important to him and you squeeze.

470
00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:35.884
Gunther will never let me
have one of his apartments again.

471
00:48:35.973 --> 00:48:39.259
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.

472
00:48:39.352 --> 00:48:41.143
You are a good sport.

473
00:48:41.228 --> 00:48:42.391
Thanks, Max.

474
00:48:43.439 --> 00:48:44.899
Or is it Maxine?

475
00:48:45.025 --> 00:48:48.311
Ha ha. I don't have to tell you

476
00:48:48.403 --> 00:48:51.322
what a comfort anonymity
can be in my profession.

477
00:48:52.492 --> 00:48:55.944
It's like a warm blanket.

478
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:02.250
My deal with Job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

479
00:49:02.336 --> 00:49:04.543
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

480
00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:07.916
What was your deal with Job?

481
00:49:08.094 --> 00:49:10.798
Um...$6 million.

482
00:49:10.888 --> 00:49:12.797
I'll give you the same,

483
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.260
but I want the complete list now,
not just Eastern Europe.

484
00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:19.638
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous. The entire list.

485
00:49:19.731 --> 00:49:20.727
10 million.

486
00:49:20.816 --> 00:49:24.352
10 million in negotiable
US Treasury certificates

487
00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:28.658
in bearer form, coupons attached,
and one more thing.

488
00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:35.745
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

489
00:49:47.889 --> 00:49:48.885
Oh.

490
00:49:51.268 --> 00:49:54.186
Max made a deal with you?

491
00:49:54.272 --> 00:49:57.973
I deliver the NOC list,
Max delivers Job.

492
00:49:59.778 --> 00:50:02.696
We've got 75 rounds
for your Beretta,

493
00:50:02.781 --> 00:50:04.989
but only 20 for the Sig Sauer.

494
00:50:05.076 --> 00:50:09.122
One pair of Visco glasses
with monitor.

495
00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:10.701
Plenty of passports, and...

496
00:50:15.797 --> 00:50:16.829
What?

497
00:50:16.923 --> 00:50:22.345
You said it yourself,
if I'm not dead, I'm with you.

498
00:50:23.765 --> 00:50:25.592
Are you sure about this?

499
00:50:25.684 --> 00:50:27.724
Jim was my husband.

500
00:50:27.811 --> 00:50:30.516
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

501
00:50:32.024 --> 00:50:35.809
We're going to need some help.
We don't have a lot of time,

502
00:50:35.904 --> 00:50:37.813
so they'll have to be local.

503
00:50:37.906 --> 00:50:38.903
What kind of help?

504
00:51:12.822 --> 00:51:14.731
Simple game.

505
00:51:14.824 --> 00:51:16.698
Four players.

506
00:51:16.785 --> 00:51:19.358
Exfil opens the pocket.

507
00:51:19.454 --> 00:51:21.162
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

508
00:51:21.248 --> 00:51:23.287
Bank?

509
00:51:24.376 --> 00:51:25.920
IMF mainframe.

510
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:28.840
Where exactly is it?

511
00:51:28.924 --> 00:51:30.205
In Langley.

512
00:51:33.637 --> 00:51:34.716
In Langley?

513
00:51:34.805 --> 00:51:37.641
The one in Virginia, Langley?

514
00:51:37.726 --> 00:51:41.724
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

515
00:51:42.857 --> 00:51:44.351
Is he serious?

516
00:51:44.442 --> 00:51:46.435
Always.

517
00:51:47.863 --> 00:51:52.738
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

518
00:51:52.826 --> 00:51:57.075
I can fly a helicopter through
the lobby and land inside the vault.

519
00:51:57.166 --> 00:52:01.413
And it would be easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

520
00:52:01.503 --> 00:52:02.748
What are we downloading?

521
00:52:02.838 --> 00:52:04.083
Information.

522
00:52:04.173 --> 00:52:05.168
What kind?

523
00:52:05.257 --> 00:52:06.421
Profitable.

524
00:52:07.927 --> 00:52:09.338
Payment on delivery.

525
00:52:11.641 --> 00:52:16.138
I don't know. I just don't know.

526
00:52:17.731 --> 00:52:22.108
Well, this doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

527
00:52:22.194 --> 00:52:24.482
What did they call you,
the Net Ranger?

528
00:52:24.571 --> 00:52:26.316
Phineas Phreak?

529
00:52:27.076 --> 00:52:30.112
The only man alive who actually
hacked Nato Ghostcom.

530
00:52:30.204 --> 00:52:32.280
There was never
any physical evidence

531
00:52:32.373 --> 00:52:35.788
that I had anything
to do with that... with that...

532
00:52:36.294 --> 00:52:39.544
that exceptional piece of work.

533
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:45.584
You don't know what you're missing.

534
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.717
This is the Mount Everest of hacks.

535
00:52:48.809 --> 00:52:51.097
You're all kidding yourselves.

536
00:52:51.186 --> 00:52:55.563
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU 3s...

537
00:52:55.649 --> 00:52:57.774
Krieger can get it, right?

538
00:52:58.946 --> 00:53:00.855
May take a little time.

539
00:53:00.948 --> 00:53:02.656
"A little time"?

540
00:53:02.741 --> 00:53:04.817
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

541
00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:07.741
Thinking-machine laptops.

542
00:53:09.124 --> 00:53:12.041
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes

543
00:53:12.127 --> 00:53:14.879
with the artificial intelligence
risk chip.

544
00:53:14.964 --> 00:53:15.960
24 hours.

545
00:53:17.926 --> 00:53:22.505
And, uh... I get to keep
the equipment when we're done.

546
00:53:22.597 --> 00:53:25.468
Luther,
I guess you're all out of excuses.

547
00:53:30.482 --> 00:53:34.527
Look, uh...
I just can't hack my way inside.

548
00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:38.480
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

549
00:53:38.575 --> 00:53:40.947
It's in what we call
the stand alone,

550
00:53:41.036 --> 00:53:45.533
which means I'll have to be
physically at the terminal.

551
00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:47.831
Relax, Luther.

552
00:53:47.919 --> 00:53:50.707
It's much worse than you think.

553
00:53:50.797 --> 00:53:53.715
The terminal
is in a black vault lockdown.

554
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.126
The only person
allowed in the room

555
00:53:56.219 --> 00:53:58.891
has to pass through a series
of security checks.

556
00:53:58.974 --> 00:54:00.385
William Donloe.

557
00:54:00.476 --> 00:54:02.717
The first
is a voiceprint identification

558
00:54:02.811 --> 00:54:04.934
and a six-digit access code.

559
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:11.895
This only gets him
into the outer room.

560
00:54:11.988 --> 00:54:14.907
Next, he has to pass
a retinal scan.

561
00:54:17.913 --> 00:54:20.748
And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures

562
00:54:20.832 --> 00:54:24.415
are only deactivated
by a double electronic key card...

563
00:54:24.503 --> 00:54:26.211
which we won't have.

564
00:54:28.257 --> 00:54:32.920
Now, inside the black vault,
there are three systems operating

565
00:54:33.013 --> 00:54:35.421
whenever the technician
is out of the room.

566
00:54:35.516 --> 00:54:37.723
The first is sound sensitive -

567
00:54:37.811 --> 00:54:40.218
anything above a whisper
sets it off.

568
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.061
The second system detects
any increase in temperature.

569
00:54:45.152 --> 00:54:48.653
Even the body heat of an
unauthorised person in the room

570
00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.738
will trigger it if the temperature
rises just a single degree.

571
00:54:56.081 --> 00:54:59.036
That temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning

572
00:54:59.127 --> 00:55:03.208
coming in through an overhead duct
30 feet above the floor.

573
00:55:05.426 --> 00:55:08.047
That vent is guarded
by a laser net.

574
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:14.972
The third system is on the floor
and is pressure sensitive.

575
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:19.108
The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm,

576
00:55:19.192 --> 00:55:22.063
and any one of these systems,

577
00:55:22.154 --> 00:55:27.658
if set off, will activate
an automatic lockdown.

578
00:55:27.743 --> 00:55:31.825
Now... believe me when I tell you,
gentlemen, all three systems

579
00:55:31.915 --> 00:55:33.540
are state-of-the-art.

580
00:55:36.503 --> 00:55:39.422
And you really think we can do this?

581
00:56:16.216 --> 00:56:20.678
We picked up alarms
in Sectors 3, 7, and 12.

582
00:56:20.764 --> 00:56:22.970
<i>Where's the air conditioning?</i>

583
00:56:23.058 --> 00:56:25.763
<i>- 21.
- There's no alarm in Sector 21.</i>

584
00:56:25.852 --> 00:56:29.721
<i>- I got to shut it down.
- Sorry, nobody gets in there.</i>

585
00:56:29.816 --> 00:56:32.188
<i>You want fire through this building?</i>

586
00:56:32.276 --> 00:56:36.227
<i>No one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off,</i>

587
00:56:36.323 --> 00:56:37.319
<i>and it hasn't...</i>

588
00:56:37.408 --> 00:56:38.736
<i>Wait.</i>

589
00:56:41.996 --> 00:56:43.704
<i>It's gone off.</i>

590
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:45.414
Let's move.

591
00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:58.837
Can I get you anything?

592
00:56:58.932 --> 00:57:00.593
No, thank you.

593
00:57:02.937 --> 00:57:05.061
21's through here.

594
00:57:11.281 --> 00:57:13.653
He's recruiting. For what purpose?

595
00:57:14.826 --> 00:57:15.941
Survival.

596
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:19.287
Too short-sighted.
This guy initiates. He's proactive.

597
00:57:19.373 --> 00:57:23.454
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

598
00:57:23.545 --> 00:57:25.419
Barnes, what's that noise?

599
00:57:25.505 --> 00:57:28.079
Uh, the fire alarm, Gene.

600
00:57:30.261 --> 00:57:32.384
Do we have to evacuate?

601
00:58:18.775 --> 00:58:23.154
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

602
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:28.319
Zero body count.

603
00:58:28.412 --> 00:58:29.443
We'll see.

604
01:00:02.855 --> 01:00:04.136
Hi, there.

605
01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.712
One.

606
01:01:06.804 --> 01:01:07.883
Two.

607
01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:10.215
Three.

608
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:11.388
Toast.

609
01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:13.180
Toast.

610
01:01:13.271 --> 01:01:14.931
<i>Check.</i>

611
01:01:15.023 --> 01:01:16.054
Good.

612
01:01:16.149 --> 01:01:19.020
OK, Luther, I'm going in.

613
01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.902
Everest, man.

614
01:01:20.987 --> 01:01:22.981
<i>You ready to plant the flag?</i>

615
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.488
Damn.

616
01:01:31.666 --> 01:01:35.796
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

617
01:02:52.177 --> 01:02:53.552
He's rolling to you.

618
01:02:57.809 --> 01:02:59.885
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

619
01:02:59.978 --> 01:03:01.638
William Donloe.

620
01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.536
Outer room.

621
01:03:23.254 --> 01:03:24.631
He's coming in the vault.

622
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.924
Come on, move.

623
01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.946
Oh...

624
01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.083
Oh...

625
01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:02.369
He's in the bathroom.

626
01:06:19.919 --> 01:06:22.493
A-W-9...

627
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:25.162
6-B-6.

628
01:06:43.988 --> 01:06:46.028
Holy Mother of God.

629
01:06:46.115 --> 01:06:48.359
The NOC list.

630
01:09:45.158 --> 01:09:46.616
He's at the vault.

631
01:10:00.259 --> 01:10:01.504
Four yellows.

632
01:10:04.054 --> 01:10:05.928
One red.

633
01:10:17.528 --> 01:10:18.524
Get moving.

634
01:10:20.407 --> 01:10:21.949
Toast.

635
01:10:23.035 --> 01:10:24.067
Toast.

636
01:10:27.582 --> 01:10:28.578
Merci.

637
01:11:27.068 --> 01:11:28.527
Oh, my God.

638
01:11:39.707 --> 01:11:40.705
Yeah.

639
01:11:43.588 --> 01:11:46.257
It's... for you.

640
01:11:47.717 --> 01:11:48.713
Kittridge.

641
01:12:11.746 --> 01:12:14.319
You and I know about this.

642
01:12:14.415 --> 01:12:16.573
That's where it stops,
you understand?

643
01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:18.826
- It never happened.
- What about him?

644
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:24.163
I want him manning a radar tower
in Alaska. Mail him his clothes.

645
01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:05.887
You contacting your buyer?

646
01:13:07.726 --> 01:13:09.636
Ethan?

647
01:13:15.069 --> 01:13:16.314
Ethan.

648
01:13:23.078 --> 01:13:24.276
Ethan.

649
01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:26.654
Oh...

650
01:13:26.748 --> 01:13:29.834
Excuse me. Mr Hunt.

651
01:13:39.263 --> 01:13:41.589
You're not going
to any meeting without me.

652
01:13:43.728 --> 01:13:46.563
My contact is extremely shy.

653
01:13:48.232 --> 01:13:52.527
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders, do you?

654
01:13:52.613 --> 01:13:55.567
Not while I'm holding this.

655
01:13:55.657 --> 01:13:56.772
Krieger...

656
01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:04.500
You mean this?

657
01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:07.040
That's not the list.

658
01:14:07.129 --> 01:14:10.664
What's the matter?
You've never seen this trick?

659
01:14:18.726 --> 01:14:20.932
Where'd it go?

660
01:14:23.774 --> 01:14:25.731
It's gone.

661
01:14:26.652 --> 01:14:28.062
What?

662
01:14:28.153 --> 01:14:29.149
You.

663
01:14:29.238 --> 01:14:30.234
No.

664
01:14:30.323 --> 01:14:31.568
No?

665
01:14:31.658 --> 01:14:32.939
No, come on.

666
01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:38.617
But not too far.

667
01:14:42.837 --> 01:14:44.747
I know what you're thinking,
Krieger.

668
01:14:44.839 --> 01:14:47.414
You're thinking,
back in the computer room,

669
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:50.713
I was up here, he was...
he was down there.

670
01:14:52.516 --> 01:14:54.758
Yes, and he was...

671
01:14:54.851 --> 01:14:58.303
he was carrying two disks.

672
01:14:58.397 --> 01:15:02.479
So hard to keep track
of these things.

673
01:15:03.404 --> 01:15:04.518
Where is it?

674
01:15:18.379 --> 01:15:22.424
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the NOC list?

675
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:28.139
Try any sleight of hand with
my money, and I'll cut your throat.

676
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.586
<i>You're off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?</i>

677
01:15:56.673 --> 01:15:59.544
<i>Yeah. Where'd they
put you up this time, the Plaza?</i>

678
01:15:59.635 --> 01:16:01.045
<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>

679
01:16:03.599 --> 01:16:05.638
I'm so sorry.

680
01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:14.355
Krieger was my call.

681
01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.284
I'm sorry, Ethan.

682
01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:30.128
We did what we had to do.

683
01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:34.255
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

684
01:17:12.136 --> 01:17:14.260
Krieger did have the NOC list?

685
01:17:23.065 --> 01:17:26.981
- You hold on to it.
- What makes you trust me?

686
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:30.274
Because if you knew about it,
you never would have done it.

687
01:17:36.624 --> 01:17:39.909
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

688
01:17:40.002 --> 01:17:43.501
Exactly. That's your job
tomorrow on the train.

689
01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:46.507
Don't let this NOC list
get out in the open.

690
01:17:53.309 --> 01:17:55.718
What is the range of this thing?

691
01:17:55.812 --> 01:17:59.063
It's hard to tell.
We're going to have to be close.

692
01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.980
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

693
01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.238
<i>The unlikely setting -</i>

694
01:18:05.324 --> 01:18:08.740
<i>a farm in the heartland of America,
the state of Wisconsin,</i>

695
01:18:08.827 --> 01:18:11.579
<i>where Federal Agents claim
to have found the brains</i>

696
01:18:11.664 --> 01:18:13.455
<i>behind an international drug ring.</i>

697
01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:16.708
<i>The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan Hunt</i>

698
01:18:16.795 --> 01:18:18.834
<i>and her brother-in-law Donald Hunt.</i>

699
01:18:18.922 --> 01:18:20.797
<i>They were arrested this morning</i>

700
01:18:20.883 --> 01:18:24.418
<i>by drug enforcement officers
in a major sting operation</i>

701
01:18:24.512 --> 01:18:27.182
<i>designed to expose
the illegal manufacture</i>

702
01:18:27.266 --> 01:18:30.101
<i>of the drug Methcathinone,
known as Cat.</i>

703
01:18:30.185 --> 01:18:32.890
<i>- What we have here...
- Kittridge.</i>

704
01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:04.004
Kittridge.

705
01:19:04.099 --> 01:19:06.638
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.

706
01:19:06.728 --> 01:19:09.932
It's Hunt. What do you
need for a pinpoint?

707
01:19:10.024 --> 01:19:13.475
You've been watching
a little TV, have you?

708
01:19:14.778 --> 01:19:18.824
Hauling mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

709
01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:20.189
He's in England.

710
01:19:20.285 --> 01:19:21.281
Get MI5.

711
01:19:21.369 --> 01:19:23.078
Ethan, I want to assure you

712
01:19:23.164 --> 01:19:26.664
that my first order of business
after you come in

713
01:19:26.752 --> 01:19:30.286
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped

714
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.706
and eliminated completely
from their files.

715
01:19:32.799 --> 01:19:35.718
If you, uh, if you come in now,

716
01:19:35.803 --> 01:19:39.138
we can plea down
the charges against you as well.

717
01:19:40.684 --> 01:19:42.760
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?

718
01:19:44.271 --> 01:19:45.765
Certainly, Ethan.

719
01:19:45.857 --> 01:19:51.611
If you're dealing with someone
who's crushed, stabbed,

720
01:19:51.696 --> 01:19:54.568
shot, and detonated

721
01:19:54.659 --> 01:19:57.945
five members of his own IMF team...

722
01:19:59.248 --> 01:20:01.573
how devastated do you think he'll be

723
01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:04.621
by marching Ma and Uncle Donald
to the county courthouse?

724
01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:08.046
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

725
01:20:10.552 --> 01:20:11.833
Lost him.

726
01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:15.675
We needed three more seconds.

727
01:20:15.766 --> 01:20:18.685
He wanted us to know
he was in London.

728
01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:34.572
You're a hard man to catch up with.

729
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.339
The next day I managed
to drag myself to the safe house.

730
01:20:46.427 --> 01:20:50.046
I must have just missed you.
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

731
01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.216
Then you followed us to the States.

732
01:20:52.309 --> 01:20:55.097
But you left
before I could get there.

733
01:20:55.187 --> 01:20:57.858
Smaller countries don't computerise
customs records.

734
01:20:57.941 --> 01:21:00.313
So I watched Europe.

735
01:21:00.402 --> 01:21:03.438
Once you turned up
in England, it was easy.

736
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:06.199
You knew I liked the rentals
at Liverpool Street.

737
01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:08.111
Hey, I showed them to you.

738
01:21:10.456 --> 01:21:11.866
I remember.

739
01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:15.707
Who do you think
you're kidding here?

740
01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:19.046
A doctor's got to see you.
You can't sit up straight.

741
01:21:19.132 --> 01:21:23.082
I can sit up straight. I just can't
sit up straight very well.

742
01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:26.548
Sit down. Sit down.
It's not important.

743
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:29.097
Ethan...

744
01:21:31.647 --> 01:21:33.105
I saw who shot me.

745
01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:36.144
I saw the mole.

746
01:21:36.234 --> 01:21:38.027
It was Kittridge.

747
01:21:38.112 --> 01:21:39.986
Kittridge.

748
01:21:40.073 --> 01:21:42.113
Kittridge, Ethan.

749
01:21:47.749 --> 01:21:50.501
Kittridge is the mole.

750
01:21:50.585 --> 01:21:52.494
My God, of course. You're right.

751
01:21:58.512 --> 01:22:00.588
He was at the embassy that night.

752
01:22:04.142 --> 01:22:08.011
First, he took out Jack
at the elevator.

753
01:22:15.739 --> 01:22:18.148
He shot you on the bridge.

754
01:22:47.234 --> 01:22:48.860
Ethan!

755
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:06.123
He must have had back-up to take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

756
01:23:24.569 --> 01:23:26.728
How did he do Hannah?

757
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:55.766
No. No. He could have
done Hannah himself.

758
01:24:22.137 --> 01:24:23.465
Why, Jim?

759
01:24:25.765 --> 01:24:26.797
Why?

760
01:24:29.729 --> 01:24:34.273
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable. No more cold war.

761
01:24:34.359 --> 01:24:37.775
No more secrets you keep
from everyone but yourself.

762
01:24:37.863 --> 01:24:42.075
Operations - you answer
to no one but yourself.

763
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.152
And then one day you wake up.

764
01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:48.160
The President is running the country
without your permission.

765
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.122
The son of a bitch. How dare he?

766
01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:53.919
Then you realise it's over.

767
01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:57.127
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

768
01:24:57.218 --> 01:25:00.423
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

769
01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:03.975
Kittridge...

770
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:07.512
We'll go after the no-good
son of a bitch big time.

771
01:25:12.445 --> 01:25:14.936
We won't have to.

772
01:25:15.031 --> 01:25:17.108
He'll come after us.

773
01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:19.526
What's going to make him do that?

774
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.619
What he didn't get in Prague -
the NOC list.

775
01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:27.496
Whoa.

776
01:25:27.587 --> 01:25:29.331
Jesus, Ethan.

777
01:25:30.883 --> 01:25:33.553
Good for you. Phew.

778
01:25:33.637 --> 01:25:36.922
I'm meeting tomorrow on the TGV,
en route to Paris.

779
01:25:37.015 --> 01:25:39.471
Tight security. No guns.

780
01:25:39.559 --> 01:25:41.138
A real plus.

781
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:43.850
If I supposedly deliver
the NOC list to Max,

782
01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.229
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

783
01:25:46.317 --> 01:25:49.568
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

784
01:25:49.655 --> 01:25:51.981
Krieger will have helicopter
transport waiting in Paris.

785
01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:56.157
Jim?

786
01:26:05.799 --> 01:26:08.171
I was in a cafe
waiting for you, Ethan.

787
01:26:11.347 --> 01:26:13.174
And there she was...

788
01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:15.757
standing in the rain...

789
01:26:15.852 --> 01:26:17.180
alive and beautiful,

790
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:20.141
thinking I'm dead and gone.

791
01:26:22.777 --> 01:26:26.727
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me, to keep going,

792
01:26:26.823 --> 01:26:28.103
to get the job done.

793
01:26:32.246 --> 01:26:36.494
She can't know about me, Ethan.
No one can until this is over.

794
01:26:36.585 --> 01:26:38.577
You're probably right.

795
01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:41.209
There's too much at stake.

796
01:26:43.843 --> 01:26:48.256
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

797
01:26:48.348 --> 01:26:50.425
I'll call you from Paris.

798
01:26:50.517 --> 01:26:51.763
You got it.

799
01:27:14.879 --> 01:27:16.160
What happened?

800
01:27:20.344 --> 01:27:22.384
I sent the message to Max.

801
01:27:26.434 --> 01:27:28.059
We're on for tomorrow.

802
01:27:35.988 --> 01:27:37.268
OK.

803
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:48.865
Come here.

804
01:28:31.134 --> 01:28:32.843
Sir.

805
01:28:32.928 --> 01:28:33.924
What's this?

806
01:28:34.013 --> 01:28:35.472
Incoming, sir, for you.

807
01:28:35.556 --> 01:28:37.965
X-ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

808
01:28:49.238 --> 01:28:50.483
Gene?

809
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.622
How long to the London Terminus?

810
01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:58.703
20, 25 minutes.

811
01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:00.250
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

812
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:39.084
Yes?

813
01:29:39.172 --> 01:29:40.797
<i>Give me Max.</i>

814
01:29:40.882 --> 01:29:42.258
It's him.

815
01:29:45.888 --> 01:29:47.715
This was not what we discussed.

816
01:29:47.807 --> 01:29:50.013
<i>My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.</i>

817
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:52.674
<i>There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.</i>

818
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:54.516
<i>Tear it away,
and you'll find the disk.</i>

819
01:30:29.356 --> 01:30:32.606
Dear boy...

820
01:30:32.692 --> 01:30:36.276
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

821
01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:39.615
<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

822
01:30:39.701 --> 01:30:41.990
The mere possibility
is worth 10 million.

823
01:30:42.079 --> 01:30:44.072
Baggage car, rack three.

824
01:30:44.165 --> 01:30:48.661
Silver briefcase, combination 314.

825
01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:50.295
<i>What about Job?</i>

826
01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.660
Wouldn't worry about him.

827
01:30:51.756 --> 01:30:53.832
When you get the money,
he'll find you.

828
01:31:11.822 --> 01:31:13.364
What's the matter?

829
01:31:13.448 --> 01:31:14.908
It's not transmitting.

830
01:31:14.992 --> 01:31:16.736
Try it, try it again!

831
01:31:16.828 --> 01:31:19.449
Damn it, I've got to get this
through before we hit the Channel.

832
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.842
What's the problem?

833
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:35.094
Connection denied.

834
01:31:35.182 --> 01:31:38.219
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

835
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:40.220
I always do.

836
01:31:40.312 --> 01:31:43.896
Don't give me that.
Run it through from the top.

837
01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:51.148
This is bullshit.
We don't even know what Max looks like.

838
01:31:51.242 --> 01:31:52.440
We don't need to.

839
01:31:52.535 --> 01:31:56.582
If he's got that list, he's going
to check it. And that means laptops.

840
01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.845
Excuse me, sir.

841
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:11.306
Your telephone?

842
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:12.802
Hello?

843
01:32:14.561 --> 01:32:16.222
I can't hear anything.

844
01:32:17.774 --> 01:32:19.184
Is everything all right?

845
01:32:19.275 --> 01:32:20.390
The battery is gone.

846
01:32:20.485 --> 01:32:22.062
It's working.

847
01:32:34.417 --> 01:32:36.126
He's in the baggage car.

848
01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.252
Ethan, Kittridge is on the train.

849
01:32:40.341 --> 01:32:41.835
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

850
01:32:41.926 --> 01:32:44.797
<i>The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.</i>

851
01:33:01.324 --> 01:33:02.569
Barnes?

852
01:33:40.703 --> 01:33:42.577
Ethan's right behind me.

853
01:33:43.748 --> 01:33:45.575
Listen, Jim...

854
01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:48.586
Is it such a good idea to kill him?

855
01:33:51.799 --> 01:33:54.041
Kittridge is here.

856
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:59.848
We take the money...

857
01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.010
Ethan takes the blame.

858
01:34:04.355 --> 01:34:06.894
No one else has seen you alive.

859
01:34:09.111 --> 01:34:11.270
No one will believe him.

860
01:34:38.896 --> 01:34:40.521
Of course...

861
01:34:40.606 --> 01:34:43.477
I'm very sorry to hear
you say that, Claire.

862
01:34:46.864 --> 01:34:47.860
Ethan...

863
01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:48.945
Yes.

864
01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:53.494
Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

865
01:34:55.832 --> 01:34:57.624
You knew about Jim?

866
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:58.908
Of course.

867
01:35:00.964 --> 01:35:03.715
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

868
01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.591
Mind telling me, Ethan?

869
01:35:05.677 --> 01:35:09.094
Before or after
I showed up in London?

870
01:35:10.266 --> 01:35:11.511
Before London.

871
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.886
But after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

872
01:35:15.896 --> 01:35:19.599
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn Gideons.

873
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.903
Ethan...
if you knew about Jim, why...

874
01:35:24.991 --> 01:35:26.153
Why the masquerade?

875
01:35:26.242 --> 01:35:28.319
Why take the risk?

876
01:35:28.412 --> 01:35:30.036
Well, Claire...

877
01:35:30.122 --> 01:35:31.950
you've asked the question.

878
01:35:32.041 --> 01:35:34.663
And you are the answer.

879
01:35:34.753 --> 01:35:36.959
I knew about Jim.

880
01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:39.752
But he didn't know about you.

881
01:35:39.842 --> 01:35:41.466
In all fairness, Ethan,

882
01:35:41.552 --> 01:35:45.170
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

883
01:35:45.264 --> 01:35:46.806
But I was supremely confident,

884
01:35:46.891 --> 01:35:49.218
having tasted the goods.

885
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:57.192
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbour's wife", Ethan.

886
01:35:58.113 --> 01:36:00.569
Let's get the money and get out.

887
01:36:00.657 --> 01:36:01.820
Yes, let's get the money.

888
01:36:03.119 --> 01:36:05.789
Ethan... the money.

889
01:36:08.626 --> 01:36:09.824
Give her the money.

890
01:36:13.756 --> 01:36:15.167
You've earned it.

891
01:36:22.391 --> 01:36:24.051
All ten million.

892
01:36:24.185 --> 01:36:28.053
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

893
01:36:28.148 --> 01:36:29.940
Oh?

894
01:36:30.067 --> 01:36:31.265
What's that?

895
01:36:50.383 --> 01:36:52.506
Good morning, Mr Phelps.

896
01:36:54.178 --> 01:36:56.420
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

897
01:36:59.977 --> 01:37:01.934
You son of a bitch.

898
01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.847
It's over, Jim.

899
01:37:10.114 --> 01:37:12.984
Don't... Don't, Jim.

900
01:37:13.075 --> 01:37:14.451
"Don't, Jim"?

901
01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.436
Aah!

902
01:40:24.799 --> 01:40:25.997
Damn!

903
01:40:29.387 --> 01:40:31.427
No, it's in the tunnel!

904
01:40:31.682 --> 01:40:34.007
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

905
01:40:34.101 --> 01:40:35.643
Accelerate! Accelerate!

906
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:38.949
Red light!

907
01:42:40.122 --> 01:42:41.865
Green light!

908
01:43:34.478 --> 01:43:36.850
I think this is what
you're looking for.

909
01:43:43.238 --> 01:43:45.694
Hello, Max.

910
01:43:45.783 --> 01:43:48.986
My lawyers are going to have
a field day with this.

911
01:43:49.078 --> 01:43:51.651
Entrapment,
jurisdictional conflict...

912
01:43:51.747 --> 01:43:55.580
Well, maybe we'll just leave
the courts out of this one.

913
01:43:57.546 --> 01:44:01.379
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

914
01:44:04.179 --> 01:44:07.548
<i>In a freak accident, a helicopter lost altitude,
veered into a tunnel,</i>

915
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:11.805
<i>and collided with a train
on its way from London to Paris.</i>

916
01:44:11.895 --> 01:44:15.895
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.</i>

917
01:44:15.985 --> 01:44:19.817
<i>Authorities have attributed the
accident to instrument failure...</i>

918
01:44:19.905 --> 01:44:22.231
Reach your folks? How do they feel?

919
01:44:22.324 --> 01:44:23.903
About what?

920
01:44:23.994 --> 01:44:26.948
The apology
from the Justice Department,

921
01:44:27.038 --> 01:44:30.823
VIP treatment,
you know, the whole 9 yards.

922
01:44:30.918 --> 01:44:32.958
Well, my mom was a little confused

923
01:44:33.045 --> 01:44:35.798
how the DEA could mistake
her and Uncle Donald

924
01:44:35.883 --> 01:44:38.504
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

925
01:44:41.221 --> 01:44:42.466
Cheers.

926
01:44:43.515 --> 01:44:45.889
To you, Luther.

927
01:44:45.978 --> 01:44:47.935
For being off the disavowed list.

928
01:44:48.022 --> 01:44:50.477
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month.

929
01:44:51.984 --> 01:44:54.310
Why don't you come back with me?

930
01:44:56.907 --> 01:45:01.036
I just... l just don't know
why I'd be doing it.

931
01:45:03.372 --> 01:45:05.864
Got to go catch my flight.

932
01:45:05.959 --> 01:45:08.711
So how does it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

933
01:45:11.173 --> 01:45:12.797
Man, I don't know.

934
01:45:14.969 --> 01:45:17.544
I'm going to miss
being disreputable.

935
01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.309
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better,

936
01:45:20.392 --> 01:45:21.803
I'll always think of you that way.

937
01:45:33.574 --> 01:45:35.449
Excuse me. Mr Hunt?

938
01:45:36.703 --> 01:45:39.989
Would you like to watch a movie?

939
01:45:40.082 --> 01:45:43.996
Oh, uh... no, thank you.

940
01:45:44.086 --> 01:45:47.457
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

941
01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:51.502
Aruba, perhaps?
