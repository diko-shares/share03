1
00:03:13.374 --> 00:03:19.755
Young man, do you have the time?
I got six clocks, and none of them work.

2
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.009
- Twenty after nine.
- After?

3
00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:26.512
It's twenty after, dear. Darlin'?

4
00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:31.642
- Five minutes. What about you?
- I'm all set. I just ironed my sling.

5
00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:36.647
- The lawyer said 9.30 sharp, darlin'.
- OK.

6
00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:41.235
I hope you're not the miserly kind.
It's brand-new.

7
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.363
She ought to get a very good price for it.

8
00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:47.199
Is that the right mileage? 23 miles?

9
00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:50.619
We only took two rides in it.
It's the darn men.

10
00:03:50.744 --> 00:03:53.539
They run into her
just to start a conversation.

11
00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:56.333
- Will you come up, Iz?
- Sure, dear.

12
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.919
Don't go by appearances. It's brand-new.

13
00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:01.839
It was a divorce present
from her husband.

14
00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:04.800
- They givin' presents for divorces now?
- Why not?

15
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.512
On the anniversary of our divorce,
my husband always sends me...

16
00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:13.308
.. one potted yellow rose,
and it'll be 19 years in July.

17
00:04:14.184 --> 00:04:16.937
Course, he never did pay me the alimony.

18
00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:21.316
But I wouldn't wanna put a man out,
you know, if his heart's not in it.

19
00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.902
You break your arm in the car?

20
00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:30.450
No. My last roomer, the one before Mrs
Taber, we celebrated her divorce and...

21
00:04:31.493 --> 00:04:34.162
.. I misbehaved.

22
00:04:34.288 --> 00:04:37.374
I'm so sick and tired of myself.

23
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.269
- Will you go over my answers again?
- Sure, dear.

24
00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:00.397
But don't worry, you'll do wonderfully.

25
00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:04.484
Let's see. "Did your husband,
Mr Raymond Taber,...

26
00:05:04.609 --> 00:05:07.070
.. act toward you with cruelty?"

27
00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.948
Darlin'?

28
00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:12.867
- Well, yes.
- Just say yes.

29
00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:14.494
Yes.

30
00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:18.456
"In what way did this cruelty
manifest itself?"

31
00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.132
He persistently... How does that go again?

32
00:05:27.757 --> 00:05:31.886
"He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights,...

33
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.891
.. and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me. "

34
00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:39.435
He persistently...

35
00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:43.982
Oh, do I have to say that?

36
00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:52.031
Why can't I just say he wasn't there? He...
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.

37
00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:54.492
If that was grounds for divorce,...

38
00:05:54.617 --> 00:05:59.706
.. there'd only be about 11 marriages
left in the US. Now just repeat after me.

39
00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:03.751
- "He persistently...
- He persistently...

40
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.881
They'll call in their estimate, ma'am.

41
00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:12.093
Those dents aren't my fault, you know.

42
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.264
I'll recommend
the best price I can, ma'am.

43
00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.267
You can drive her now.
I've put in a new battery.

44
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:22.520
I'll never drive that car again.
Let's take a taxi.

45
00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:25.856
I... I'll give you a lift
if you're leaving right away.

46
00:06:25.982 --> 00:06:28.025
Swell. Two minutes.

47
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.112
Iz, get dressed! You gotta be my witness.

48
00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:36.033
This'll be my 77th time
I've witnessed for a divorce.

49
00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:38.786
Two sevens - that's lucky, darlin'!

50
00:06:39.912 --> 00:06:42.331
Oh, Iz, I hope.

51
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:58.347
- Easy does it, now.
- Oh, you're a dear.

52
00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:01.600
- Here we are.
- Thanks a lot. We've gotta go now.

53
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:06.146
If you're not goin' back East right away,
I'd be glad to show you the county.

54
00:07:06.272 --> 00:07:09.191
Beautiful country around here, you know.

55
00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:12.569
Well, I don't know where I'll be, but OK.
Thanks again.

56
00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:15.447
My name is Isabelle Steers.

57
00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:18.617
Isabelle. Well, OK, you come along too.

58
00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:23.330
That's a sweet afterthought!
You Reno men!

59
00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:29.711
I can't memorise this.
It's not the way it was.

60
00:07:29.837 --> 00:07:34.758
Just say it. It doesn't have to be true.
This isn't a quiz show, it's only a court.

61
00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:46.311
- I just got off the plane...
- I don't wanna hear anything.

62
00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:49.439
Just give me five minutes.
After two years, five minutes...

63
00:07:49.564 --> 00:07:52.025
You can't have me now,
so you want me, that's all.

64
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.031
Please, I'm not blaming you. It's... I just
don't believe in the whole thing any more.

65
00:07:58.156 --> 00:08:00.742
Kid, I understand. I understand...

66
00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:04.121
You don't understand.
You're not there, Raymond.

67
00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:07.165
If I'm gonna be alone,
I wanna be by myself.

68
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.795
Go back. You're not gonna make me
feel sorry for you any more.

69
00:08:25.684 --> 00:08:27.644
Gay!

70
00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:30.563
Wait up! I was just goin' over to see ya!

71
00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:35.985
Well, good luck now, Susan.
I won't forget you, you can be sure of that.

72
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.116
- I don't even know where to write you.
- General delivery. I'll get it.

73
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:44.994
Will you think about it? It's the
second-largest laundry in St Louis.

74
00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:48.164
I wouldn't wanna kid you.
I ain't cut out for business.

75
00:08:48.289 --> 00:08:51.251
Well, will you think of me? Oh, Gay...

76
00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:54.921
Oh, you know I will, honey. Goodbye.

77
00:08:57.882 --> 00:08:59.926
Bye.

78
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.733
How're you doin', boy?
Ready to cut out of this town? Cos I am.

79
00:09:15.858 --> 00:09:18.528
Well, I've been thinkin' about it.

80
00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:22.990
- Which one was that?
- Susan. Swell sport, that woman.

81
00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:29.121
I just met me a girl sweet enough to eat,
Gay. Fine-lookin' woman.

82
00:09:29.247 --> 00:09:33.334
But when I think of all the useless talkin'
you gotta do, I get discouraged.

83
00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:37.880
I tell you, I'm dyin' for some fresh air.
And no people, male or female.

84
00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:42.426
Why don't we take out to the mountains?
We could even do a little mustangin'.

85
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:45.179
I wanted to pile up about 500 this time.

86
00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:48.265
- I need a new engine.
- That engine'll fly you anywhere.

87
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:51.560
Say, you've been two months on this job.
You'll get the habit.

88
00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:55.731
I'll see you over at Harrah's later.
Let's talk about it.

89
00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:00.986
Tom Dooley.

90
00:10:18.337 --> 00:10:22.633
If you throw in your ring
you'll never get another divorce.

91
00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:24.968
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.

92
00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:29.348
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.

93
00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:38.190
- Did you do that?
- Who, me? No.

94
00:10:38.315 --> 00:10:41.235
I lost my ring on my honeymoon.

95
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:45.614
- Let's get a drink.
- That's my girl.

96
00:10:51.828 --> 00:10:55.916
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.

97
00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:05.425
Never say die.

98
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.278
Scotch, I guess, on i... Yeah, on ice.

99
00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:28.365
- Rye and water.
- Scotch on ice, rye and water.

100
00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:31.701
Well, cheer up.

101
00:11:32.243 --> 00:11:34.579
I will. I just hate to fight with anybody.

102
00:11:34.704 --> 00:11:37.999
When you win, you lose.
You know, in your heart.

103
00:11:38.124 --> 00:11:42.712
Well, you're free. Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.

104
00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:46.841
No, the trouble is I always
end up back where I started.

105
00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:50.470
Never had anybody much. And here I am.

106
00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:54.474
Well, you had your mother, didn't you?

107
00:11:56.392 --> 00:12:00.647
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?

108
00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:06.194
They both weren't there. She'd go off
with a patient for three months and...

109
00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:10.114
You know how long
three months is to a kid.

110
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.702
Listen, don't leave. Settle here.

111
00:12:15.995 --> 00:12:19.707
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.

112
00:12:19.832 --> 00:12:24.921
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.

113
00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:30.384
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? I...

114
00:12:32.595 --> 00:12:37.183
I suddenly miss my mother.
Oh, isn't that the stupidest thing?

115
00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:46.400
Iz, you're a fine woman. Practically the
only woman that's ever been my friend.

116
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:48.819
Well, drink up then.

117
00:12:51.864 --> 00:12:56.494
Oh, isn't that the dearest dog?
Look how sweet he sits there.

118
00:12:56.619 --> 00:12:59.622
Yeah. Dogs are nice.

119
00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:02.041
Here. Puppy.

120
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:13.135
Hey, Dooley.

121
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.643
Hello. How'd you make out?

122
00:13:21.977 --> 00:13:24.021
OK.

123
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:27.900
I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine. Gay...

124
00:13:28.609 --> 00:13:30.986
Gay Langland, Mrs Taber.

125
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.328
- Howdy do?
- And this is Mrs, uh...?

126
00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:45.125
Steers. Isabelle Steers. One thing about
Reno men, they do remember the name.

127
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:50.631
- Why don't you boys sit down?
- Thank you. What're you girls drinkin'?

128
00:13:50.756 --> 00:13:54.343
Whiskey. We're celebratin'
the jail burned down.

129
00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.346
Mary, see if you can get
four doubles, will you?

130
00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:07.522
Uh... you sure made a big impression
on my friend here. And I can see why.

131
00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:11.318
- You a mechanic too?
- Him? He's a cowboy.

132
00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:14.613
- How'd you know?
- I can smell, can't I?

133
00:14:14.738 --> 00:14:19.743
- Hey, you can't smell cows on me.
- I smell the look on your face, cowboy.

134
00:14:19.868 --> 00:14:23.038
But I love every miserable one of ya.

135
00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.874
Course, you're all good for nothin',
as you know.

136
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:29.085
That may be. But it's better than wages.

137
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.297
I suppose you'll be headin'
back East soon, Mrs Taber?

138
00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:35.300
I can't make up my mind.
I don't know yet what to do.

139
00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:38.428
You don't have a business to run,
or a school to teach, or...?

140
00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:41.264
Me? I never finished high school.

141
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:43.975
Well! That's real good news.

142
00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:47.729
- You don't like educated women?
- They're all right.

143
00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:51.191
Always wantin' to know
what you're thinkin', that's all.

144
00:14:51.316 --> 00:14:53.359
Maybe they want to get to know you.

145
00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:58.114
Did you ever get to know a man better
by askin' him questions?

146
00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:01.743
- You mean he'd lie?
- Well, he might not.

147
00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.454
And then again, he just might.

148
00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:08.958
How about it, Pilot?
We takin' off today?

149
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:11.794
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs Taber?

150
00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:15.381
I walked to the edge of town.
Doesn't look like much is out there.

151
00:15:15.506 --> 00:15:17.592
Everything's there.

152
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:20.470
- Like what?
- The country.

153
00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:24.557
- Well, what do you do with yourself?
- Just live.

154
00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:28.895
- How do you just live?
- Well, you start by goin' to sleep.

155
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.940
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself. You fry some eggs.

156
00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:38.154
You see what kind of a day it is.
You throw stones at a can and whistle.

157
00:15:39.614 --> 00:15:41.616
I know what you mean.

158
00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:44.994
I have an empty house in the country
just beyond Hawleyville.

159
00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:49.332
It's all yours if you want some
peace and quiet before you go back.

160
00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:51.834
The last woman's gone?

161
00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.296
No kiddin'. I never offered it before.

162
00:15:56.881 --> 00:16:01.135
Well, I wouldn't stay there. But let's rent
a car. We could look at the country.

163
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.930
- Gay has a truck. You can have my car.
- Then you'll have to drive me back.

164
00:16:05.055 --> 00:16:09.727
- I don't mind.
- Thanks, but I like to feel I'm on my own.

165
00:16:09.852 --> 00:16:13.063
- I'll rent a car. Where can I?
- Right now?

166
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:17.443
- Why not?
- OK. You sure don't waste time, do you?

167
00:16:18.652 --> 00:16:21.322
I just gotta stop by the garage and quit.

168
00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.866
Hey, now, that's the boy.

169
00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:28.078
No, Gay. This is mine.

170
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.138
Mm. What is that beautiful smell?
Smells like green perfume.

171
00:16:46.263 --> 00:16:49.016
- That's sage, darlin'.
- Oh, sure!

172
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:53.312
I never smelled it except in bottles.
Gee, it's beautiful here.

173
00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:58.609
Look, dear girl, I think I better
tell you somethin' about cowboys.

174
00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:03.113
- You really worry about me, don't you?
- Well, you're too believin'.

175
00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:05.657
Cowboys are the last real men left,...

176
00:17:05.782 --> 00:17:09.578
.. and they're about as reliable
as jack rabbits.

177
00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:11.997
Is anybody any different?

178
00:17:12.122 --> 00:17:16.460
Maybe you're not supposed to believe
people. Maybe it's not even fair to them.

179
00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:24.509
I couldn't hear what he said to her, but
it looked like she left him. The husband.

180
00:17:25.385 --> 00:17:27.971
She's kinda hard to figure out, you know?

181
00:17:28.096 --> 00:17:32.809
One minute she looks kinda dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,...

182
00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:35.604
.. and the next minute...

183
00:17:35.729 --> 00:17:40.442
- She sure moves, though, don't she?
- Mm. She's real prime.

184
00:18:05.383 --> 00:18:09.345
- It isn't finished yet.
- It's weathertight. Come on in.

185
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.806
It's insulated.

186
00:18:14.642 --> 00:18:16.894
Flush doors.

187
00:18:18.646 --> 00:18:20.690
This is the living room.

188
00:18:20.815 --> 00:18:24.318
And this was gonna be another bedroom.

189
00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:29.115
It's even nicer this way.

190
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.994
Here's a picture window.
Take a look at this view.

191
00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:44.171
- Take a look at that.
- Gee. It goes on for ever.

192
00:18:47.466 --> 00:18:49.927
Fireplace.

193
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:53.347
- Brick.
- This is the kitchen.

194
00:18:53.472 --> 00:18:56.309
- Gas refrigerator.
- It's nice.

195
00:18:56.434 --> 00:18:59.562
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.

196
00:19:02.773 --> 00:19:05.818
Here's our... This was our bedroom.

197
00:19:07.027 --> 00:19:10.781
My wife. She died here.

198
00:19:13.617 --> 00:19:15.661
I'm... sorry.

199
00:19:16.495 --> 00:19:21.917
She was due to have a baby. I was up
setting the capstone on the chimney...

200
00:19:23.002 --> 00:19:25.337
.. and she screamed...

201
00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:28.507
.. and that was that.

202
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:34.305
Couldn't you call a doctor?

203
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:40.519
She didn't seem to be that sick.
Then I got a flat. I didn't have a spare.

204
00:19:40.644 --> 00:19:44.898
Everything just happened wrong.
It'll do that sometimes.

205
00:19:46.191 --> 00:19:48.235
Yeah, I know.

206
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.655
Uh, you couldn't live here any more, huh?

207
00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:55.534
We knew each other
since we were seven years old, see?

208
00:19:56.243 --> 00:19:59.037
You ought to find yourself another girl.

209
00:19:59.162 --> 00:20:04.126
I don't know. Me with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?

210
00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:07.129
She wasn't like any other women.

211
00:20:07.254 --> 00:20:11.591
Stood behind me 100 per cent,
uncomplaining as a tree.

212
00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:15.387
Maybe that's what killed her.

213
00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:19.516
I mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes maybe.

214
00:20:19.641 --> 00:20:22.644
Hey, Iz, isn't this a beautiful place here?

215
00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:27.399
Yeah. It'd be just perfect if somebody'd
bring in that bottle of whiskey I bought.

216
00:20:27.524 --> 00:20:29.818
- With my own money.
- Hey, that's right!

217
00:20:29.943 --> 00:20:33.488
And bring that bag of groceries.
Maybe somebody wants a sandwich.

218
00:20:33.613 --> 00:20:38.243
The glasses are in the kitchen, Isabelle.
I'm real tired.

219
00:20:38.368 --> 00:20:40.579
No, you're just a cowboy, darlin'.

220
00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:44.666
You fellas won't move
unless it's rainin' down your necks.

221
00:20:48.336 --> 00:20:50.880
Too rough for you, Roslyn?

222
00:20:51.589 --> 00:20:53.883
I don't mind that.

223
00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:58.638
You should've seen his wife. She helped
pour cement and knocked in nails.

224
00:20:58.763 --> 00:21:01.433
She was a real good sport.

225
00:21:02.016 --> 00:21:05.520
Now she's dead because
he didn't have a spare tyre.

226
00:21:05.645 --> 00:21:08.273
Well, that's the way it goes.

227
00:21:08.398 --> 00:21:12.235
It goes the other way too, though.
Don't forget that.

228
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.655
It's sure nice to see people in here.
Come on, let's have a drink.

229
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.035
- I'll start the fridge. It makes ice quick.
- Ice? We gonna stay that long, Roslyn?

230
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.289
- I don't know.
- Oh, sure. Come on.

231
00:21:24.414 --> 00:21:29.502
There's no better place to be. And you
couldn't find better company, either.

232
00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:32.213
- All right.
- That's it, sport.

233
00:21:32.338 --> 00:21:36.175
Turn on that ice, Guido. Let's get this stuff
a-flowin', make the desert bloom.

234
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.678
Well, flow it slow. We only got one bottle.

235
00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:42.390
There. Put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.

236
00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:46.769
Come on, sit down, everybody.
Let's get comfortable.

237
00:21:50.648 --> 00:21:55.444
- I'm sure glad you like this place.
- Here's to Nevada, the "leave it" state.

238
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.822
- The what state?
- The "leave it" state.

239
00:21:57.947 --> 00:22:00.533
You got money to gamble, leave it here.

240
00:22:00.658 --> 00:22:03.202
A wife you wanna get rid of,
get rid of her here.

241
00:22:03.327 --> 00:22:07.873
Extra atom bomb you don't need, blow it
up here. Nobody will mind in the slightest.

242
00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:12.670
The slogan of Nevada is "Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went. "

243
00:22:13.671 --> 00:22:17.216
- That's no lie.
- I even left my Southern accent here.

244
00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:22.138
How come you never went back home?
You came here for a divorce, didn't you?

245
00:22:22.263 --> 00:22:25.140
- I wasn't beautiful enough to go back.
- Oh, Isabelle.

246
00:22:25.266 --> 00:22:30.980
No, that's true. Beauty's a help any place,
but in Virginia it's a necessity.

247
00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:34.024
Why, you can't hardly
get a driver's licence without it.

248
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:39.029
No, I love Nevada. You know, they don't
even have regular meal times here.

249
00:22:39.154 --> 00:22:42.032
Never met so many people
didn't own a watch.

250
00:22:42.157 --> 00:22:46.912
Might have two wives at the same time,
but no watch. Bless them all.

251
00:22:47.037 --> 00:22:49.456
How quiet it is here.

252
00:22:49.581 --> 00:22:51.959
Sweetest sound there is.

253
00:22:52.084 --> 00:22:57.339
There's an Indian store about five miles,
if you wanna shop. Groceries, everything.

254
00:22:57.464 --> 00:22:59.842
If you wanna stay, that is.

255
00:22:59.967 --> 00:23:03.512
Be glad to come by
and do your chores, if you like.

256
00:23:03.637 --> 00:23:08.892
You know, he reminds me of that
cowboy friend I told you about.

257
00:23:09.017 --> 00:23:12.312
Had one arm gone, but he was
more man with one arm...

258
00:23:12.437 --> 00:23:14.731
.. than any other man is with two.

259
00:23:14.856 --> 00:23:16.274
Oh?

260
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.736
- I mean like cookin'.
- Oh!

261
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:23.323
No, I'm serious. He could take
a panful of chops, toss 'em,...

262
00:23:23.448 --> 00:23:25.742
.. and they all came down
on the other side.

263
00:23:25.867 --> 00:23:30.831
- Who is he? Maybe they know him.
- Darlin', you can't go lookin' for a man.

264
00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:34.209
- What, did he take off?
- No, not exactly.

265
00:23:35.293 --> 00:23:37.838
He just never came back.

266
00:23:40.465 --> 00:23:44.177
- Andy Powell. You ever...?
- Sure! Called Andy Gump sometimes?

267
00:23:44.302 --> 00:23:46.346
That's him.

268
00:23:46.471 --> 00:23:50.058
- You know where he is?
- Saw him at the rodeo only last month.

269
00:23:50.183 --> 00:23:55.146
- Maybe we could find him.
- Stop thinkin' you can change things.

270
00:23:55.647 --> 00:23:58.108
But if there's something you can do...

271
00:23:58.233 --> 00:24:01.736
I don't know what to do,
but if I knew, I'd do it.

272
00:24:02.612 --> 00:24:06.950
Have you got a radio or a phonograph?
Maybe we'll have some music.

273
00:24:07.075 --> 00:24:10.578
- There's no electricity.
- The car radio.

274
00:24:10.703 --> 00:24:15.250
- Now who'd have thought of that?
- You always get an idea, don't you?

275
00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:17.710
I'll go bring the car round.

276
00:24:19.337 --> 00:24:23.049
Say, how about another drink
to keep that first one warm?

277
00:24:23.174 --> 00:24:26.844
- I'd love it.
- I'm gonna make myself a sandwich.

278
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.597
- How about you folks?
- OK.

279
00:24:30.723 --> 00:24:33.851
I hope you're gonna stay on here.
Any chance?

280
00:24:33.976 --> 00:24:36.270
Why? What difference would it make?

281
00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:40.024
Might make all the difference in the world
as time goes by.

282
00:24:42.402 --> 00:24:45.238
- Like to dance?
- OK.

283
00:24:56.916 --> 00:25:01.587
Thanks. Iz, give him another drink.
It's a wonderful house, Guido.

284
00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:04.590
Hey, that's pretty good dancin', cowboy.

285
00:25:05.174 --> 00:25:07.218
What are you doin'?

286
00:25:07.343 --> 00:25:11.222
She used to teach dancin'.
You know? Before she was married.

287
00:25:11.347 --> 00:25:14.892
- No kiddin'? In a dance hall?
- Uh-huh.

288
00:25:16.936 --> 00:25:20.064
How about the landlord?
Move over, boy, huh?

289
00:25:20.189 --> 00:25:24.401
- Watch out for those pretty little feet.
- She knows how to get out of the way.

290
00:25:24.527 --> 00:25:26.570
Let's go.

291
00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:47.549
Where'd you learn that, Pilot?

292
00:25:49.218 --> 00:25:51.553
I never knew him to dance at all.

293
00:25:55.391 --> 00:25:59.394
Look at old Pilot comin' out
from under a bushel!

294
00:26:02.898 --> 00:26:05.818
Hey, you two ought to put on a show!

295
00:26:33.637 --> 00:26:38.683
Come on, honey. This is a good one.
I haven't danced like this in years.

296
00:26:41.978 --> 00:26:47.359
- Didn't your wife dance?
- Not like you. She had no gracefulness.

297
00:26:47.484 --> 00:26:50.362
Why didn't you teach her to be graceful?

298
00:26:50.487 --> 00:26:53.114
You can't learn that.

299
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.993
How do you know?
I mean, how do you know?

300
00:26:57.118 --> 00:27:01.331
You see, she died, and she didn't
know how you can dance.

301
00:27:01.456 --> 00:27:05.210
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.

302
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:10.048
- I don't feel like discussing my wife.
- Don't be mad.

303
00:27:10.173 --> 00:27:13.885
I only meant that if you loved her
you could've taught her anything.

304
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.764
Because... we're all dying, aren't we?

305
00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:22.852
All the husbands and all the wives.
Every minute.

306
00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:28.066
And we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?

307
00:27:28.191 --> 00:27:30.693
Dum da-da... dum...

308
00:27:30.818 --> 00:27:33.404
Guido, you're a nice man.

309
00:27:35.573 --> 00:27:37.617
Smile.

310
00:27:39.577 --> 00:27:41.621
Come on.

311
00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:19.533
- Come on, Iz.
- I'm lookin' for your shoes, dear girl.

312
00:28:20.284 --> 00:28:22.787
Watch out. There's no step!

313
00:29:19.218 --> 00:29:21.678
We better get you home, girl.

314
00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:26.558
You were worried about me. How sweet.

315
00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:30.687
Just wanna keep you
all in one pretty piece.

316
00:29:31.688 --> 00:29:34.066
Would you have had a spare tyre?

317
00:29:34.191 --> 00:29:36.902
Somebody'd better drive her.

318
00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:43.158
Go ahead. I'll take the truck.

319
00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:46.161
Oh, Iz, don't leave poor Guido alone.

320
00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:49.372
Tom Dooley!

321
00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:27.535
You're a real beautiful woman.

322
00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:34.375
It's almost kind of an honour
sittin' next to you.

323
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.213
You just shine in my eyes.
That's my true feelin', Roslyn.

324
00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:49.474
What makes you so sad? I think
you're the saddest girl I ever met.

325
00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:55.980
You're the first man that ever said that.
I'm usually told how happy I am.

326
00:30:56.105 --> 00:30:59.650
That's because you make
a man feel happy.

327
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:05.072
I don't feel that way about you, Gay.

328
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:13.789
Well, don't get discouraged, girl.
You might.

329
00:31:15.708 --> 00:31:20.671
Look, why don't you try it out here
for a while, see what happens?

330
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:23.841
You know, sometimes when
a person don't know what to do,...

331
00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:27.470
.. the best thing is to just stand still.

332
00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:34.393
I'll guarantee you'll have something out
here you wouldn't find on every corner.

333
00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:40.649
I, uh... I may not amount to much
in some ways, but I am a good friend.

334
00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:45.613
Thanks.

335
00:31:47.907 --> 00:31:53.454
Let me take you back and get your things.
Try it for a while, see what happens.

336
00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:57.458
Ever hear the story
about the city man out in the country?

337
00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:01.920
He sees this fella sittin' on his porch,
so he says "Mister,...

338
00:32:02.046 --> 00:32:07.176
.. could you tell me how I can get back
to town?" The fella says "No. "

339
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:12.639
"Well, could you tell me how to get
to the post office?" The fella says "No. "

340
00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.977
"Well, do you know how to get
to the railroad station?" "No. "

341
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:20.439
"Boy," he says, "you sure
don't know much, do you?"

342
00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:23.400
The fella says "Nope. But I ain't lost. "

343
00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:34.453
Don't you have a home?

344
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.166
Sure. Never was a better one, either.

345
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:42.377
Where is it?

346
00:32:43.837 --> 00:32:45.881
Right here.

347
00:33:42.228 --> 00:33:45.398
Come on. I got a surprise for you.

348
00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:14.051
You cooked breakfast. Here, let me.

349
00:34:14.176 --> 00:34:18.639
No, no, no. You sit down
and enjoy yourself. Just this once.

350
00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:23.102
- You do this often?
- Uh-uh. First time for me.

351
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.189
- Really and truly?
- Mm-hm.

352
00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:30.484
Mm. Smells delicious.

353
00:34:35.906 --> 00:34:38.409
Hey, you really go all out, don't you?

354
00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:43.289
Even the way you eat. I like that.
Women generally pick.

355
00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.457
You like me, huh?

356
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.631
Birds must be brave to live out here.
At night especially.

357
00:34:52.756 --> 00:34:56.051
- Whereas they're so small, you know?
- Mm-hm.

358
00:34:58.053 --> 00:35:02.433
- You think I'm crazy.
- I look that way cos I can't make you out.

359
00:35:02.558 --> 00:35:05.352
- Why?
- I don't know.

360
00:35:05.477 --> 00:35:08.105
You got children?

361
00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:12.025
- I never wanted children with him.
- Oh.

362
00:35:14.194 --> 00:35:19.283
Children are supposed to bring you
together. But what if they don't?

363
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.164
I've known of so-called
happily married couples.

364
00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:30.043
One time, the wife was in the hospital
to have the baby...

365
00:35:30.168 --> 00:35:33.088
.. and the husband was calling me up.

366
00:35:33.213 --> 00:35:35.299
I mean, he was calling me.

367
00:35:37.467 --> 00:35:40.595
They're still supposed
to be happily married.

368
00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:43.348
I guess you believe in true love,
don't you?

369
00:35:43.473 --> 00:35:47.227
I don't know, but they ought to invent
a way that you don't have children...

370
00:35:47.352 --> 00:35:50.772
.. unless you care for each other,
cos kids know the difference.

371
00:35:50.897 --> 00:35:53.108
I always knew the difference.

372
00:35:53.233 --> 00:35:57.320
Listen, if you wanna go somewhere,
I don't mind being alone.

373
00:35:57.445 --> 00:36:03.159
- Do I look like I wanna leave?
- I just want you to do what you feel like.

374
00:36:03.285 --> 00:36:08.623
You ain't kiddin'. Even when
you're kiddin', you ain't kiddin'.

375
00:36:08.748 --> 00:36:11.293
No. It makes me feel peaceful.

376
00:36:12.544 --> 00:36:16.506
You know, they come out here
from New York, Chicago, St Louis,...

377
00:36:16.631 --> 00:36:20.385
.. and find them a cowboy. Cowboys
are supposed to be dumb, you know.

378
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.430
So they tell 'em everything.
And they do everything.

379
00:36:23.555 --> 00:36:26.433
Everything they couldn't do back home.

380
00:36:26.558 --> 00:36:28.935
- It's pitiful.
- Why is it pitiful?

381
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.440
Cowboy's laughin' at 'em,
and they don't even know it.

382
00:36:33.565 --> 00:36:37.652
It's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.

383
00:36:37.777 --> 00:36:40.572
Did you ever think
of getting married again?

384
00:36:40.697 --> 00:36:45.702
Yeah. I've thought about it a lot of times.
But never in daylight.

385
00:36:48.454 --> 00:36:51.833
- You get lonesome for your children?
- Oh, I see 'em now and then.

386
00:36:51.958 --> 00:36:56.504
They come whenever I'm in a rodeo.
I'm a pretty good roper.

387
00:36:59.632 --> 00:37:02.343
I get lonesome, sure.

388
00:37:02.468 --> 00:37:07.974
My daughter is almost your size.
Uh... You size 12?

389
00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:10.560
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. So is she.

390
00:37:10.685 --> 00:37:14.188
I bought her a dress for Christmas.
Size 12.

391
00:37:16.899 --> 00:37:21.279
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?

392
00:37:21.404 --> 00:37:26.200
Well, I come home one night and
she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella.

393
00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:30.705
Turned out to be an old friend.
A cousin of mine, as a matter of fact.

394
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.708
Oh. You never had any idea, huh?

395
00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:38.587
No. You know, in those days
I thought you got married and that was it.

396
00:37:38.713 --> 00:37:41.590
But nothin' is it. Not for ever.

397
00:37:43.509 --> 00:37:47.263
That's what I can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.

398
00:37:49.765 --> 00:37:55.521
I'll tell you this, though. I wouldn't know
how to say goodbye to you, Roslyn.

399
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.567
It surprises me.

400
00:38:04.154 --> 00:38:08.492
There's a lot to be done around this place.
If we were gonna stay awhile.

401
00:38:08.617 --> 00:38:11.495
Let's go out in the sunshine. Come on.

402
00:38:17.751 --> 00:38:23.006
Let's just live like you said in the bar.
I don't know where I am yet.

403
00:38:25.551 --> 00:38:28.387
Hey! Couldn't we use that for a step?

404
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:32.307
Well, we just might at that.

405
00:38:46.822 --> 00:38:49.825
- There you are.
- Let me try it.

406
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:53.704
It's perfect. I can go in...
and I can come out.

407
00:38:55.163 --> 00:38:58.250
Go in... and I can come out.

408
00:38:59.876 --> 00:39:01.878
Go in...

409
00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:04.256
.. and I can come out.

410
00:39:04.881 --> 00:39:07.133
I can go in...

411
00:39:07.259 --> 00:39:09.553
.. and I can come out.

412
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.322
Guido!

413
00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:16.202
- What's he doing?
- Might land. There's a place back there.

414
00:40:21.332 --> 00:40:24.502
Nah. I guess he's just sayin' hello.

415
00:40:24.627 --> 00:40:27.880
- Here, have some lemonade.
- Oh, thanks.

416
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.468
- What does he do? Just fly around?
- Could be goin' for eagles.

417
00:40:32.593 --> 00:40:35.054
Now and again ranchers
hire Guido to shoot eagles.

418
00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:38.599
- Why?
- Well, they kill a lot of lambs.

419
00:40:38.724 --> 00:40:41.268
He gets $50 a bird.

420
00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:45.648
I never really saw anything grow before.

421
00:40:45.773 --> 00:40:51.862
How tiny those seeds were. And yet they
know they're supposed to be lettuces.

422
00:40:51.987 --> 00:40:55.741
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don't you?

423
00:40:55.866 --> 00:40:59.620
Everybody's busy in Chicago,
and here we are.

424
00:41:00.996 --> 00:41:03.207
I love this whole state!

425
00:41:06.502 --> 00:41:09.046
Hey... What have we here now?

426
00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:14.009
Well... Just plain old rabbit!

427
00:41:15.594 --> 00:41:18.013
I'm gonna get him.

428
00:41:18.138 --> 00:41:20.974
It's just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it any more.

429
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:26.271
No, ma'am! It's them or us! There won't
be a thing left inside of a week.

430
00:41:26.396 --> 00:41:30.234
Couldn't you wait and see?
I can't stand to see anything killed.

431
00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:34.822
- Honey, it's only a rabbit.
- But it doesn't know any better, does it?

432
00:41:34.947 --> 00:41:37.157
Go on inside and let me handle this.

433
00:41:37.282 --> 00:41:40.035
- I know you worked hard...
- You're darn right!

434
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.914
And I didn't do it
for some bug-eyed rabbit.

435
00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:47.542
- Gay, please.
- Honey, will you go on inside now?

436
00:41:47.668 --> 00:41:51.296
- And stop bein' silly?
- I'm not being silly.

437
00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:53.715
You don't respect what I feel.

438
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.010
- And I don't care about the lettuce!
- I care about it!

439
00:41:57.135 --> 00:42:00.138
And how about havin'
some respect for me?

440
00:42:01.098 --> 00:42:03.350
Oh, Guido and Isabelle!

441
00:42:03.475 --> 00:42:05.519
- Guido!
- Dear girl!

442
00:42:05.644 --> 00:42:09.314
I thought I saw a passenger!
We never heard you land.

443
00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:13.693
- My, you look thrivin'.
- Boy, am I in the right place?

444
00:42:13.818 --> 00:42:17.489
Seen the vegetable garden?
Took Gay a week just to turn the soil.

445
00:42:17.614 --> 00:42:20.033
Mowed the grass
and put in them flowers too.

446
00:42:20.158 --> 00:42:23.119
I got your windows unstuck.
Fireplace don't smoke now.

447
00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:28.667
You must be a magician. All he ever did
for a woman was get out the ice cubes.

448
00:42:28.792 --> 00:42:32.128
- Look, we have chairs. Come and sit.
- Let's show him the inside.

449
00:42:32.253 --> 00:42:37.133
You know, I've moved this furniture
so many times, I'm gettin' long ears!

450
00:42:37.717 --> 00:42:41.971
My, you look lovely. You've really
found yourself, haven't you?

451
00:42:42.097 --> 00:42:46.476
Well, I... Oh, it's so nice to see you,
Isabelle. Look, we have a step.

452
00:42:46.601 --> 00:42:50.230
- How's your arm?
- Well, it's still as weak as a bird's wing.

453
00:42:51.147 --> 00:42:55.777
Well, I never saw anything like it
in my life. It's magical.

454
00:42:55.902 --> 00:42:59.697
Just hope you realise you finally
made contact with a real woman.

455
00:42:59.822 --> 00:43:01.950
My dear girl!

456
00:43:02.075 --> 00:43:07.330
Come, Guido. I wanna show you the rest.
I've changed a few things, though.

457
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.834
We've changed things around.

458
00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:15.713
How do you like it?

459
00:43:16.297 --> 00:43:20.051
Oh, don't look at those.
Gay just hung 'em up for a joke.

460
00:43:20.176 --> 00:43:23.179
I put your picture up in the living room.

461
00:43:24.555 --> 00:43:27.892
Come on, let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.

462
00:43:31.604 --> 00:43:34.106
Oh, it's so nice to have company.

463
00:43:39.612 --> 00:43:44.116
- I put your picture there. Is that all right?
- You don't have to keep it out.

464
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:48.579
Why, Guido, it's part of the house.
Besides, it's your house.

465
00:43:48.704 --> 00:43:51.957
Oh, sit in the big chair.
This must've been your chair.

466
00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:54.168
Matter of fact, it was.

467
00:43:54.293 --> 00:43:57.088
Isabelle. Put this under your arm.

468
00:43:57.213 --> 00:43:59.256
Thanks, dear girl.

469
00:44:00.382 --> 00:44:04.345
I used to do all my studyin' in this chair.
When I was still ambitious.

470
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.305
What did you study?

471
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.600
I was on my way to bein' a doctor.
Before the war.

472
00:44:09.725 --> 00:44:13.395
Well, you never can tell.
Maybe you'll get ambitious again.

473
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.398
I'm gonna tell you somethin', Roslyn.

474
00:44:16.523 --> 00:44:21.362
I spent four years in the war.
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.

475
00:44:21.862 --> 00:44:25.949
Every time I came back to base
I started to design this house.

476
00:44:26.075 --> 00:44:29.912
But somehow I could never
get it to look like my idea of it.

477
00:44:30.329 --> 00:44:32.956
Now it almost does.

478
00:44:33.082 --> 00:44:35.834
You just walk in,
a stranger out of nowhere,...

479
00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:39.046
.. and for the first time it all lights up.

480
00:44:40.297 --> 00:44:42.799
And I'm sure you know why too.

481
00:44:43.759 --> 00:44:47.429
- Why?
- Because you have the gift for life.

482
00:44:47.763 --> 00:44:52.768
The rest of us, we're just lookin' for
a place to hide and watch it all go by.

483
00:44:52.893 --> 00:44:54.936
Amen.

484
00:44:55.729 --> 00:44:59.941
Here's to your life, Roslyn.
I hope it goes on for ever.

485
00:45:00.067 --> 00:45:02.652
And yours. And yours, Isabelle.

486
00:45:03.528 --> 00:45:07.157
And Gay. Gay did all the work, you know.

487
00:45:07.282 --> 00:45:11.536
Yeah. And the rabbits
are sure enjoyin' it too.

488
00:45:11.661 --> 00:45:16.750
Can you break away from this paradise
long enough to do a little mustangin'?

489
00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:21.379
Mustangin'? Now you're sayin' somethin'.
You been up in the mountains?

490
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.468
Took a quick look earlier this mornin'.
I spotted 15 horses.

491
00:45:26.593 --> 00:45:28.929
That's not too bad.

492
00:45:29.554 --> 00:45:33.183
Boy, I'd sure like
to get my hands on a rope again.

493
00:45:34.476 --> 00:45:37.520
- What do you say?
- I will never understand cowboys.

494
00:45:37.645 --> 00:45:41.191
All crazy about animals, and
the minute they got nothin' else to do,...

495
00:45:41.316 --> 00:45:44.819
.. they run up in the mountains
and bother those poor wild horses.

496
00:45:44.944 --> 00:45:47.238
Shame on you!

497
00:45:47.363 --> 00:45:49.365
Horses?

498
00:45:49.491 --> 00:45:53.620
Sure. Nevada mustang. Used
to ship 'em all over the United States.

499
00:45:53.745 --> 00:45:57.665
Not many left.
We'd have to pick up another man.

500
00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.544
Dayton Rodeo's on today. We ought
to be able to pick up a fella there.

501
00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:05.214
That's an idea.
Hey, you never saw a rodeo.

502
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.425
Oh, you gotta see a rodeo!

503
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.720
- I'd love to. Will you come too?
- I'm all set.

504
00:46:11.346 --> 00:46:15.350
- I'll get dressed up. Let's have some fun!
- That's a girl. Go right now.

505
00:46:15.475 --> 00:46:19.771
Honey, when you smile
it's like the sun comin' up.

506
00:46:27.487 --> 00:46:30.740
Boy, I'd like to have stopped off home
and get cleaned up.

507
00:46:30.865 --> 00:46:33.576
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?

508
00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:39.332
- Lots better than some I've known.
- You're a mass of compliments, Isabelle.

509
00:46:40.416 --> 00:46:44.420
Hey, Gay, stop. That guy next
to the phone booth. What's his name?

510
00:46:44.545 --> 00:46:48.174
- You worked the Stinson Rodeo with him.
- Perce Howland?

511
00:46:48.299 --> 00:46:51.260
Gay Langland! You old buzzard, you!

512
00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:54.388
What are you doin' sittin' out here, fella?

513
00:46:54.513 --> 00:46:57.224
Well, I hitched a ride
down to the Dayton Rodeo,...

514
00:46:57.349 --> 00:47:00.728
.. but this fella changed his mind
and just left me settin' here.

515
00:47:00.853 --> 00:47:03.063
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.

516
00:47:03.189 --> 00:47:06.525
Well, old Gay's sure comin' up
in the world. How do, ma'am?

517
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:08.777
This is Isabelle.

518
00:47:08.903 --> 00:47:13.240
Oh, 'scuse me. I got a call in for home,
but they keep puttin' me in to Wyoming.

519
00:47:13.365 --> 00:47:15.492
Hello?

520
00:47:15.618 --> 00:47:17.870
Hello?

521
00:47:17.995 --> 00:47:20.456
Hello, Ma? This is Perce.

522
00:47:21.498 --> 00:47:23.751
Yeah, I'm OK.

523
00:47:23.876 --> 00:47:26.754
No. I was in Colorado. I'm in Nevada now.

524
00:47:27.296 --> 00:47:29.757
Just won me a bull ride.

525
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:32.384
Yeah.

526
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.055
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.

527
00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.599
A hundred dollars.

528
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.854
Ma, I was gonna buy you
a birthday present with it,...

529
00:47:43.979 --> 00:47:46.773
.. but I was comin' out of my boots.

530
00:47:48.317 --> 00:47:54.197
No, Ma, I haven't been in hospital since
I talked to you. I just bought some boots.

531
00:47:55.324 --> 00:47:59.077
Ma, what would I wanna get married for?
I just bought me...

532
00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:06.793
Hey, you know what? On top of purse
money, I won me a nice silver buckle.

533
00:48:06.918 --> 00:48:12.174
Yeah. Got a buckin' horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.

534
00:48:12.299 --> 00:48:14.885
You proud?

535
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.306
Oh, no, no. My face is fine. It's all
healed up. It's just as good as new.

536
00:48:20.182 --> 00:48:23.101
You would too recognise me.

537
00:48:23.226 --> 00:48:27.814
Oh, OK, operator. Ma, listen.
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?

538
00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:31.610
And to Victoria.
Yeah, and to Uncle George.

539
00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:36.990
OK, say hello to him too.

540
00:48:38.074 --> 00:48:42.078
No, no, Ma. It just
slipped my mind, that's all.

541
00:48:42.203 --> 00:48:44.956
Well, OK, I'm sayin' it now.

542
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:50.003
Ma, you married him, I didn't.
So say hello to him.

543
00:48:51.546 --> 00:48:56.301
Oh, is that...? Listen, maybe
I'll call you at Christmas time.

544
00:48:57.343 --> 00:48:59.137
OK.

545
00:48:59.262 --> 00:49:01.723
Hello? Hello?

546
00:49:05.351 --> 00:49:07.812
God bless you too.

547
00:49:11.858 --> 00:49:14.277
I just know you'll take me to that rodeo.

548
00:49:14.402 --> 00:49:16.529
Sure. You entered?

549
00:49:16.654 --> 00:49:20.366
Well, I aim to be,
if I can get me a ride to town.

550
00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:23.953
And, uh, if I can raise $10
for the entrance.

551
00:49:24.078 --> 00:49:29.125
But I just spent my last $2 in that phone
booth. Boy, I'm real equipped, ain't I?

552
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.963
Say, how'd you like to do some
mustangin'? We need a third man.

553
00:49:34.088 --> 00:49:36.549
You still fly that DC-6 and seven eighths?

554
00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:39.093
It's a lot safer than buckin' horses.

555
00:49:39.218 --> 00:49:43.055
- There are still mustangs around here?
- I spotted 15 this morning.

556
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.434
- There might be a lot more, though.
- Well, I don't know.

557
00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:49.270
What do you expect to get out of it?
Of 15 horses?

558
00:49:49.395 --> 00:49:52.356
I mean, like, if there was
a thousand or more...

559
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:56.569
But goin' all the way up there for 15,
it kinda hits me sideways.

560
00:49:56.694 --> 00:50:00.489
- Better than wages, ain't it?
- Oh, anything's better than wages.

561
00:50:00.614 --> 00:50:04.827
I tell you what. We'll drive you to
the rodeo, put up the ten for the entrance.

562
00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:08.080
You come along tomorrow
and help us run some mustang.

563
00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:13.544
All right. You get me a good bottle of
whiskey to keep me primed for the rodeo.

564
00:50:13.669 --> 00:50:16.130
Just wait right here.

565
00:50:21.302 --> 00:50:24.680
You, uh... you an old friend of Gay's?

566
00:50:26.765 --> 00:50:28.976
Pretty old.

567
00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:33.981
I broke my arm twice -
no, three times, in the same place.

568
00:50:34.106 --> 00:50:36.859
And you don't do that fakin' a fall.

569
00:50:36.984 --> 00:50:39.319
You know what some of these riders do?

570
00:50:39.445 --> 00:50:42.906
They just drop off and lay there
like they was stone-dead.

571
00:50:43.031 --> 00:50:47.035
Not me, boy. I don't fake nothin'.
Right, Gay?

572
00:50:47.161 --> 00:50:50.706
That's right.
You're just a natural-born fool.

573
00:50:50.831 --> 00:50:53.876
It's wonderful to be that way.
I know what you mean.

574
00:50:54.001 --> 00:50:57.170
I used to dance in places,
and everybody thought I was crazy.

575
00:50:57.296 --> 00:51:00.424
I mean, I really tried.
People don't know the difference.

576
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:05.554
- Oh, she'd try. I can just see her tryin'.
- What kind of dancin' do you do?

577
00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:09.725
Oh, interpretive dancing.
You know, nightclubs and... That's all.

578
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:14.980
I was in a nightclub once
in Kansas City called The Naked Truth.

579
00:51:15.856 --> 00:51:18.358
And they wasn't kiddin'!

580
00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:21.445
Dayton comin' up.

581
00:51:25.699 --> 00:51:28.451
Hey, Joe! Hi, Joe!

582
00:51:33.456 --> 00:51:35.917
Hey, Bengie! Hey!

583
00:51:36.668 --> 00:51:39.254
Hi, you old heathen, you!

584
00:51:41.006 --> 00:51:44.509
- Hey, gimme.
- Hiya, Perce.

585
00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:47.345
Oh, there's Franklin.
Boy, does he hate his wife.

586
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:50.515
Hey, Franklin, how's your wife?

587
00:51:53.101 --> 00:51:58.022
Man, there are a lot of good men here.
I sure hope I drew me a good horse.

588
00:51:58.148 --> 00:52:03.027
Just come out in one piece now,
cos you gotta go mustangin' tomorrow.

589
00:52:26.759 --> 00:52:29.679
- Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
- Sure.

590
00:52:29.804 --> 00:52:33.683
- How about you, sinner?
- Oh, I got no money yet.

591
00:52:33.808 --> 00:52:37.728
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

592
00:52:38.062 --> 00:52:42.233
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

593
00:52:43.234 --> 00:52:48.531
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Frank, Church Ladies' Auxiliary.

594
00:52:48.656 --> 00:52:52.702
- You just caught me at the bar next door.
- That'll learn you to stay put.

595
00:52:52.827 --> 00:52:57.581
Church Ladies' Auxiliary.
Church Ladies' Auxiliary...

596
00:53:02.503 --> 00:53:05.089
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

597
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:10.469
Excuse me, cousin.
There ain't many of us left now.

598
00:53:10.594 --> 00:53:13.389
No. Things is tough all over, pop.

599
00:53:14.223 --> 00:53:20.354
Come on, son. Give me a great big glass
of soda pop for my grandson Lester.

600
00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:25.109
I gotta hold onto him tight,
otherwise he'll run off to school.

601
00:53:26.026 --> 00:53:28.529
Hey, wait till I show you this.

602
00:53:28.654 --> 00:53:32.908
Here is the goldarnedest contraption
that anybody ever seen.

603
00:53:33.033 --> 00:53:36.078
You gotta hit the ball.

604
00:53:36.203 --> 00:53:39.289
- You catch what I mean?
- I can do it. Let me try.

605
00:53:39.415 --> 00:53:42.292
I'll bet you $2 you can't hit it
ten times in a row.

606
00:53:42.418 --> 00:53:45.170
Wait. I'll take that bet.

607
00:53:45.295 --> 00:53:47.840
- Go on. Go on.
- I can do ten, I think.

608
00:53:47.965 --> 00:53:52.845
Here's the paddle. Gangway,
gangway, everybody. Got a bet on.

609
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.473
.. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,...

610
00:53:56.598 --> 00:54:00.769
.. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,...

611
00:54:00.894 --> 00:54:05.148
.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30...

612
00:54:08.819 --> 00:54:10.862
40.

613
00:54:40.892 --> 00:54:43.353
.. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

614
00:54:57.075 --> 00:55:00.120
Here, do it while the spirit's in you.

615
00:55:20.223 --> 00:55:23.309
- Here, here. What's the trouble?
- He put his hand on her.

616
00:55:23.434 --> 00:55:26.020
- That right, fella?
- I didn't mean nothin' by it.

617
00:55:26.145 --> 00:55:30.942
- What's goin' on? You lookin' for a fight?
- All right, all right. Let's get to the rodeo.

618
00:55:31.067 --> 00:55:33.403
Here. It's the kid's.

619
00:55:34.487 --> 00:55:36.781
Isabelle, come on.

620
00:55:45.206 --> 00:55:48.251
Lester! Where'd you get the money?

621
00:55:50.086 --> 00:55:52.129
A-ha-ha!

622
00:55:53.673 --> 00:55:57.385
One hundred... One hundred
and forty-five bucks!

623
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.013
- Hello, gold mine.
- That girl can do anything.

624
00:56:01.138 --> 00:56:03.516
I'd marry you.

625
00:56:03.641 --> 00:56:07.520
Thanks for saying it,
but you don't have to do that.

626
00:56:07.645 --> 00:56:12.316
Don't shake that thing at me!
I'm still payin' for this broken arm.

627
00:56:13.401 --> 00:56:15.736
Charles!

628
00:56:16.237 --> 00:56:20.157
It's in the middle of your pretty eyes.
You're looking for the light, sinner.

629
00:56:20.282 --> 00:56:23.577
I know you, and I love you
for your life of pain and sin.

630
00:56:23.702 --> 00:56:27.748
Give it to the only one
who loves you in your lonely desert.

631
00:56:27.873 --> 00:56:32.461
- She ain't sinned that much.
- We're going to fence off the graveyard.

632
00:56:32.586 --> 00:56:35.965
Keep these cowboys from pasturing
their horses on the graves.

633
00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:42.304
Sweetheart, you've gone and helped
our dead to rest in peace. Go reborn.

634
00:56:42.429 --> 00:56:46.642
Who do you think is here, dear girl?
Who do you think is here?

635
00:56:46.767 --> 00:56:49.520
- Who?
- My husband.

636
00:56:51.522 --> 00:56:53.565
Oh, Iz! I'm so happy.

637
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:58.445
I never was so surprised.
They're here on their vacation.

638
00:56:59.321 --> 00:57:02.282
- His wife?
- Clara. You've heard me speak about her.

639
00:57:02.407 --> 00:57:05.410
She's my oldest friend,
and she's sweeter than ever.

640
00:57:05.536 --> 00:57:08.247
She must be, to make you
so glad to see her.

641
00:57:08.372 --> 00:57:12.960
Charles never would've stayed married to
me. I even lost the vacuum cleaner once.

642
00:57:13.085 --> 00:57:15.212
They still haven't found it.

643
00:57:15.337 --> 00:57:19.967
- Well, we gotta get this boy on a horse.
- I'll be around. But I can't go mustangin'.

644
00:57:20.092 --> 00:57:23.053
They're gonna stay
at my house for a week.

645
00:57:23.178 --> 00:57:26.640
- Good luck, boy. So long.
- Oh, Isabelle...

646
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:42.948
Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, gate one.

647
00:57:44.157 --> 00:57:46.493
Here he comes.

648
00:57:54.626 --> 00:57:58.672
- I didn't know it was that dangerous!
- That's the way they want it.

649
00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:02.926
Look. See that strap they've taken off?
That's what makes 'em buck.

650
00:58:03.051 --> 00:58:06.596
- That grabs 'em where they don't like it.
- That's not fair!

651
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:09.641
Well, you wouldn't
have a rodeo otherwise.

652
00:58:09.766 --> 00:58:12.852
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.

653
00:58:16.397 --> 00:58:19.108
Lester, what are you tryin' to do?!

654
00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:31.913
- Don't break it, Grandpa.
- Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.

655
00:58:38.252 --> 00:58:41.381
- I hope you're sober.
- Man, I've won buckets of money...

656
00:58:41.506 --> 00:58:44.217
.. in towns I couldn't remember the name.

657
00:58:44.342 --> 00:58:46.761
Hey, there she is.

658
00:58:47.762 --> 00:58:50.223
I mean, there they are.

659
00:58:51.307 --> 00:58:55.645
Gay, I wouldn't, uh...
I wouldn't wanna move in on you.

660
00:58:56.562 --> 00:59:00.942
- Unless, of course, you wouldn't mind.
- Boy, I'd mind.

661
00:59:08.199 --> 00:59:11.452
The next rider is Perce Howland
of Black River, Wyoming.

662
00:59:11.577 --> 00:59:13.954
- California, not Wyoming.
- Ready, boy?

663
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.165
- Outside.
- Open the gate!

664
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:21.378
Come on, Perce!

665
00:59:26.884 --> 00:59:29.512
Perce! Perce!

666
00:59:46.153 --> 00:59:48.447
- Thanks, Jim.
- OK.

667
00:59:48.572 --> 00:59:52.659
- Where's... Where's my hat, Pa?
- You got it on, Perce.

668
00:59:52.826 --> 00:59:55.621
- You're bleeding!
- Frieda! I'm all right.

669
00:59:55.746 --> 00:59:57.790
She ain't your sister.

670
00:59:57.915 --> 01:00:01.752
Looks like you've been messing around
with the wrong end of the horse.

671
01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:04.389
Let him sit down.
Are you the doctor?

672
01:00:04.433 --> 01:00:05.674
Doctor? I don't wanna doctor.

673
01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:08.754
Hold it, boy. I'm no doctor.
I'll just clean you up.

674
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.007
- Isn't there a doctor?
- Not for 60 miles. He ain't bad hurt.

675
01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:15.177
How do you know?
Let's take him. Come with me.

676
01:00:15.343 --> 01:00:18.430
Now don't start running things, Roslyn.

677
01:00:18.555 --> 01:00:23.560
- I don't understand. He's your friend.
- You're all right, ain't you, Perce?

678
01:00:23.727 --> 01:00:26.730
- Perce, you all right?
- Did I make the whistle?

679
01:00:26.897 --> 01:00:29.316
Almost, boy. You done good, though.

680
01:00:29.482 --> 01:00:32.360
That old horse, he sure
was rank, wasn't he?

681
01:00:32.527 --> 01:00:35.614
Oh, he was a real killer! You done good.

682
01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:39.701
- Leave him. He'll get up.
- Next event is the Brahma bull riding.

683
01:00:39.868 --> 01:00:44.164
- Oh. That's me.
- No, not yet. You got a couple of minutes.

684
01:00:44.289 --> 01:00:48.543
- What for?
- He's got a bull to ride. Walk around a bit.

685
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:53.089
- Guido, he's not going in there again?
- I guess he wants to ride that bull.

686
01:00:54.257 --> 01:00:56.342
Just let him walk it off, Roz.

687
01:00:56.509 --> 01:01:00.555
Why are you doing it? Take the money
we won in the bar. You helped me win it.

688
01:01:00.722 --> 01:01:05.018
Come on, take it. It's over $100.
You don't have to go back in there.

689
01:01:05.184 --> 01:01:08.688
I'm pretty good ridin' bulls.
I want you to watch me, Roslyn.

690
01:01:08.855 --> 01:01:12.984
- But why are you doing it?
- I put in for it. I entered.

691
01:01:13.151 --> 01:01:15.153
- Stop him!
- How can I?

692
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.072
They don't mind getting busted up.

693
01:01:21.492 --> 01:01:24.078
- Perce!
- You don't know what you're saying!

694
01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:26.038
Perce, here's your prize!

695
01:01:26.205 --> 01:01:28.708
- OK, boy, you want it?
- Hell, yes!

696
01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:33.921
We still have some real men in the West.
Back again, this time on a Brahma bull,...

697
01:01:34.088 --> 01:01:38.426
.. the cowboy from Black Hills, Colorado,
Perce Howland.

698
01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:14.170
Come on, honey.
We're gonna have some drinks.

699
01:02:14.712 --> 01:02:16.839
Is he unconscious still?

700
01:02:17.006 --> 01:02:22.511
Probably, but it ain't noticeable. He's
arguing with the judge about who won.

701
01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:25.598
You still mad at me?

702
01:02:25.764 --> 01:02:27.766
I don't understand.

703
01:02:27.933 --> 01:02:32.521
People dying, and people just
standing around. Don't you care?

704
01:02:32.688 --> 01:02:35.858
I just went in for that boy
with a wild bull runnin' loose.

705
01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:39.903
- I'm lucky to be sittin' here myself!
- You did? You did?

706
01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:43.740
Well, I just thought I could get him out,
so I did, that's all.

707
01:02:43.907 --> 01:02:47.286
But what if he'd died? It would be terrible!

708
01:02:47.452 --> 01:02:51.498
Honey, we all gotta go sometime.
Dyin' is as natural as livin'.

709
01:02:51.623 --> 01:02:56.128
- A man afraid to die is afraid to live.
- Roz? Did you see me?

710
01:02:56.295 --> 01:02:59.965
You were wonderful. Get in the back.
We're taking you to a hospital.

711
01:03:00.132 --> 01:03:03.760
- Oh, no. We're gonna have some fun.
- Yeah, sure. Come on.

712
01:03:03.927 --> 01:03:06.305
- How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

713
01:03:06.471 --> 01:03:09.975
Like I was kicked by a bull.
He was somethin', wasn't he?

714
01:03:10.142 --> 01:03:13.937
Oh, I want no part of that bull,
except on a plate, medium rare.

715
01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:17.274
- Come on.
- Is he all right?

716
01:03:17.441 --> 01:03:21.486
Sure. In two weeks he won't
remember this. Or you, either.

717
01:03:21.611 --> 01:03:24.698
Why don't you give your sympathy
where it's appreciated?

718
01:03:24.823 --> 01:03:27.242
Where's that?

719
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.205
Hey, you guys, come on!

720
01:03:33.957 --> 01:03:37.168
I feel funny. I feel like...

721
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:43.675
What was in the injection that man
gave to me? I... I see the prettiest stars.

722
01:03:43.842 --> 01:03:47.470
I never seen stars before.
You ever see stars before, Gay?

723
01:03:47.637 --> 01:03:51.599
It's like that bull had
the whole Milky Way in its hoof.

724
01:03:51.766 --> 01:03:55.895
Hey, Bill? Bill?
Whiskey for eight people, huh?

725
01:03:58.356 --> 01:04:02.485
Hey, was that you
crying in the ambulance?

726
01:04:03.319 --> 01:04:06.322
- Was that her, Gay?
- Sure was.

727
01:04:07.115 --> 01:04:09.868
I certainly want to thank you.

728
01:04:11.953 --> 01:04:16.249
Oh, now... Here's to my buddy -
old, elderly Gay.

729
01:04:16.708 --> 01:04:19.002
Gay's not old.

730
01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:24.757
And to old, elderly Pilot
and his five-dollar, elderly airplane.

731
01:04:25.633 --> 01:04:28.678
And... to my friend Roslyn.

732
01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.476
- Well, we're all buddies now, right?
- That's right.

733
01:04:35.643 --> 01:04:39.772
Then what are you lookin'
so mad at me for, buddy?

734
01:04:40.189 --> 01:04:41.816
Hey...

735
01:04:41.983 --> 01:04:45.862
Uh, is it all right
if we have this dance together?

736
01:04:46.946 --> 01:04:52.285
Sure. Roslyn, why don't you
dance with Perce?

737
01:04:53.077 --> 01:04:54.996
OK.

738
01:05:13.973 --> 01:05:16.976
Nothin' like being young, is there, Gay?

739
01:05:17.143 --> 01:05:19.478
No, that's right.

740
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:27.820
But you know what they say. There's
some keeps gettin' younger all the time.

741
01:05:31.198 --> 01:05:33.534
What's eatin' you?

742
01:05:34.284 --> 01:05:36.578
Just my life.

743
01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:44.378
This is the way my father used to do it.

744
01:05:57.891 --> 01:05:59.893
Oh!

745
01:06:00.769 --> 01:06:03.522
- What's the matter?
- It's all right.

746
01:06:04.398 --> 01:06:07.442
Come on, let's go out and see the world.

747
01:06:26.294 --> 01:06:28.880
I... better sit down.

748
01:06:37.305 --> 01:06:40.433
- Do you mind?
- No.

749
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.602
Damn that bull.

750
01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:45.063
Don't say anything. Just be still.

751
01:06:47.649 --> 01:06:50.402
Gay's a pretty great fella, isn't he?

752
01:06:50.568 --> 01:06:52.570
Yes.

753
01:06:53.238 --> 01:06:57.075
You know, I can't figure you,
floatin' around out here like this.

754
01:06:57.242 --> 01:06:59.536
You belong to Gay?

755
01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:03.331
I don't know where I belong.

756
01:07:03.957 --> 01:07:08.336
I don't like to see the way
they grind up women out here.

757
01:07:08.461 --> 01:07:12.757
Although I guess
a lot of them don't mind, do they?

758
01:07:12.924 --> 01:07:14.926
Some do.

759
01:07:15.426 --> 01:07:18.554
Don't you let them grind you up. Hear?

760
01:07:20.098 --> 01:07:23.017
How come you got
such trust in your eyes?

761
01:07:23.184 --> 01:07:25.853
- I do?
- Like you was just born.

762
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.399
- Oh, no.
- Was you really cryin' for me before?

763
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.612
You were hurt. Didn't anyone
ever cry for you before?

764
01:07:36.239 --> 01:07:38.574
No. No stranger.

765
01:07:39.659 --> 01:07:46.249
Last... April 12th, I was kicked so bad,
I was out all day and all night.

766
01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:51.546
And I was with my girlfriend
and my two buddies.

767
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:55.591
I haven't seen her
and I haven't seen them since.

768
01:07:57.885 --> 01:08:00.346
They left you? Alone?

769
01:08:04.266 --> 01:08:06.602
Can I ask you something?

770
01:08:06.769 --> 01:08:13.567
I mean, I don't have anybody, uh... you
know what I mean, that I could talk to.

771
01:08:15.277 --> 01:08:18.114
And I don't know how you should do...

772
01:08:19.031 --> 01:08:21.283
What do you mean?

773
01:08:21.784 --> 01:08:26.455
Well, see, this is the first year
that I've been floatin' around.

774
01:08:26.622 --> 01:08:30.751
I'm not like Gay and Pilot.
I got a pretty good home.

775
01:08:30.918 --> 01:08:34.004
I mean, I had a good home.

776
01:08:35.172 --> 01:08:37.174
One day...

777
01:08:38.384 --> 01:08:42.096
.. my father, we was out back, and...

778
01:08:43.305 --> 01:08:46.642
.. boom, like that, it happened.
Down he went.

779
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:49.895
Some damn fool hunters.

780
01:08:51.397 --> 01:08:55.150
- They killed him?
- Mm-hm.

781
01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.028
And then she changed.

782
01:08:58.737 --> 01:09:01.865
- Who is "she"?
- My mother.

783
01:09:03.909 --> 01:09:09.748
She used... She used to be so dignified.
She'd walk next to him like a saint.

784
01:09:12.918 --> 01:09:18.882
Well, pretty soon this man
starts comin' around, and...

785
01:09:20.133 --> 01:09:22.135
Well, she changed.

786
01:09:22.302 --> 01:09:26.681
Three months, they got married. Well, OK.

787
01:09:27.391 --> 01:09:33.814
But I said to her "Ma, look. You better
get a paper from this Mr Blackwell,...

788
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:38.819
.. because I'm the oldest, and you know
Papa wanted me to have this ranch. "

789
01:09:38.985 --> 01:09:41.196
So you know what happens?

790
01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:46.034
On their wedding night
he turns around and offers me wages.

791
01:09:47.452 --> 01:09:49.788
On my father's place.

792
01:09:49.955 --> 01:09:52.707
What did she say?

793
01:09:52.874 --> 01:09:54.876
Say?

794
01:09:56.002 --> 01:09:58.338
I don't think she heard.

795
01:10:00.131 --> 01:10:03.343
It's like she hardly
remembers me any more.

796
01:10:04.594 --> 01:10:10.475
I don't know. It's hard to explain.
It's like she's changed altogether.

797
01:10:13.937 --> 01:10:19.984
So what I want to know... What I want to
know is... who do you depend on? Who?

798
01:10:21.027 --> 01:10:23.029
I don't know.

799
01:10:24.197 --> 01:10:28.076
Maybe all there really is
is just the next thing.

800
01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:31.120
The next thing that happens.

801
01:10:32.747 --> 01:10:36.042
Maybe you're not supposed to
remember anybody's promises.

802
01:10:36.209 --> 01:10:39.545
You could count on mine.
I trust you, Roslyn.

803
01:10:40.171 --> 01:10:43.341
- I think I love you.
- Oh, no. You don't know me.

804
01:10:43.633 --> 01:10:46.385
I don't care. Roz... Oh!

805
01:10:47.303 --> 01:10:49.263
That damn bull!

806
01:10:51.516 --> 01:10:54.060
Roslyn? Roslyn?

807
01:10:55.311 --> 01:10:57.688
Here we are.

808
01:10:59.398 --> 01:11:02.318
Come on now.
I want you to meet my kids.

809
01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:08.532
- Your kids are here?
- Yeah. They come to the rodeo.

810
01:11:10.493 --> 01:11:12.495
I ain't seen 'em in a year.

811
01:11:12.662 --> 01:11:17.041
Oh, you ought to see the welcome
they give me - nearly knocked me over!

812
01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:21.253
- That great?
- I'm so glad for you, Gay.

813
01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:28.636
She's gonna be 19. She got so pretty.

814
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:34.350
They just happen to be here for the rodeo.
Both of 'em. That great?

815
01:11:38.187 --> 01:11:40.481
Where are they?

816
01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.192
Where are who?

817
01:11:43.359 --> 01:11:47.571
My kids. I told 'em I'd be back in a minute.
You heard me tell 'em.

818
01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:50.074
They went outside.

819
01:11:51.658 --> 01:11:53.660
Outside.

820
01:12:02.795 --> 01:12:05.297
Gaylord! Gaylord!

821
01:12:06.715 --> 01:12:09.718
Rosemary! Gaylord!

822
01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:15.265
- Gaylord!
- Gaylord! Here's your father!

823
01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:18.518
Gaylord! I know you hear me!

824
01:12:19.394 --> 01:12:23.440
Where you gone to?
I told you I'd be right back!

825
01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:27.819
- You come here now!
- You'll probably find him at home.

826
01:12:27.986 --> 01:12:31.656
Gaylord! You come here now!

827
01:12:31.823 --> 01:12:34.242
I know you hear me!

828
01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:39.456
Rosemary! I know you hear me!
You come here now!

829
01:12:46.087 --> 01:12:50.800
Oh, Gay! They'll be looking for you,
I'm sure. They probably thought you left.

830
01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.637
Oh, poor Gay! Poor Gay!

831
01:12:58.725 --> 01:13:01.853
Aren't you going too fast? Please, huh?

832
01:13:04.939 --> 01:13:08.735
Don't worry, kid.
I never kill anybody I know.

833
01:13:09.903 --> 01:13:14.365
A fella smashed up my best girlfriend.
She was beautiful, with black hair.

834
01:13:14.532 --> 01:13:16.910
Please, Guido.

835
01:13:17.076 --> 01:13:19.746
Say... Say hello to me, Roslyn.

836
01:13:20.205 --> 01:13:22.707
Hello, Guido. Please, huh?

837
01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:30.214
We're all blind bombardiers, Roslyn.
We kill people we never even saw.

838
01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.092
I bombed nine cities.

839
01:13:33.259 --> 01:13:36.763
I sure must've broken a lot of dishes,
but I never saw them.

840
01:13:36.929 --> 01:13:41.517
You know, think of all the puppy dogs
and mail carriers...

841
01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:44.562
.. and eyeglasses that must've gone up.

842
01:13:44.729 --> 01:13:49.192
Boy, you know, droppin' a bomb
is like tellin' a lie.

843
01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.028
Makes everything so quiet.

844
01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:55.656
Pretty soon you don't hear anything,
you don't see anything.

845
01:13:55.823 --> 01:13:58.201
Not even your wife.

846
01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:03.331
Now the difference is that I see you.
You're the first one I ever really saw.

847
01:14:03.497 --> 01:14:05.833
Please, Guido, don't kill us!

848
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:09.795
How do you get to know somebody, kid?

849
01:14:10.588 --> 01:14:15.051
I can't make a landing,
and I can't get up to God, either.

850
01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.262
Help me.

851
01:14:19.013 --> 01:14:21.766
I never said "help me" in my life.

852
01:14:23.851 --> 01:14:27.980
I don't know anybody.
So how do I land, honey?

853
01:14:29.064 --> 01:14:32.109
Will you give me a little time? Say yes.

854
01:14:36.197 --> 01:14:38.532
At least say "Hello, Guido. "

855
01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:41.827
Yes, Guido. Hello, Guido.

856
01:14:44.872 --> 01:14:47.166
Hello, Roslyn.

857
01:16:29.767 --> 01:16:31.769
Huh? Huh?

858
01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.773
OK. OK. I'll drive.

859
01:16:37.525 --> 01:16:40.194
- Gay, we're here.
- Where?

860
01:16:41.404 --> 01:16:43.406
Huh? OK.

861
01:16:55.418 --> 01:16:58.671
Guido, I'm so sorry. Guido?

862
01:16:59.755 --> 01:17:02.049
I'm sorry.

863
01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:04.969
Won't you hurt your hand? It's so dark.

864
01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:08.431
Guido, look how dark it is. It's all dark.

865
01:17:08.598 --> 01:17:13.936
Hey! Hey! What in the hell
are you stompin' the flowers for?

866
01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:17.857
You busted all the damn heliotropes!

867
01:17:18.441 --> 01:17:23.863
Look at that. Look at that now.
What in the hell good is that?

868
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:30.202
- He's just trying to fix the house.
- What call has he got to fix the house?

869
01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:33.456
- He's only trying to say hello.
- Hello.

870
01:17:33.581 --> 01:17:36.417
What's goin' on?
Who's doin' that?

871
01:17:36.834 --> 01:17:40.004
Hey, who's done this? Who done this?

872
01:17:40.838 --> 01:17:44.800
- Don't take it off!
- Take it off me! What is it?

873
01:17:44.967 --> 01:17:48.137
- Don't take it off.
- Take it off! What is it?

874
01:17:48.304 --> 01:17:51.140
It's your bandage. Stop tangling it.

875
01:17:51.265 --> 01:17:54.893
- Bandage? What for, a bandage?
- For your head.

876
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:02.026
- Who tied this on me?
- The ambulance did.

877
01:18:02.192 --> 01:18:04.570
You leave me at a disadvantage all night?

878
01:18:04.737 --> 01:18:08.574
- No.
- Huh? Was it you, Gay?

879
01:18:10.492 --> 01:18:12.494
Was it you, Gay?

880
01:18:14.496 --> 01:18:16.498
Oh!

881
01:18:17.082 --> 01:18:19.751
- Who did that?
- Gay, come over here.

882
01:18:19.918 --> 01:18:23.297
- You leave me at a disadvantage?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

883
01:18:23.463 --> 01:18:25.716
Who did that to me?

884
01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:30.679
Where are we? Where are you goin'?
Leave me alone.

885
01:18:31.388 --> 01:18:36.101
Where are we goin'?
What is this blasted place?

886
01:18:36.268 --> 01:18:39.271
What is this place? Where are we?

887
01:18:39.438 --> 01:18:44.109
This is my house. Or it's Guido's.
Well, it's a house, anyway.

888
01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:02.544
No. No, Ma, Ma, don't, don't.

889
01:19:12.804 --> 01:19:14.806
Gay?

890
01:19:16.474 --> 01:19:18.560
Come on, Gay.

891
01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:22.355
I wish you'd met Gaylord and Rosemary.

892
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:29.028
If I had a new kid
I'd know just how to be with him.

893
01:19:29.946 --> 01:19:32.157
Just how to do...

894
01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:37.662
Oh, I wasted those kids.
I didn't know nothin'.

895
01:19:38.371 --> 01:19:41.124
No. I'm sure they love you, Gay.

896
01:19:42.959 --> 01:19:46.045
Would you ever want a kid... with me?

897
01:19:47.046 --> 01:19:49.799
Let me turn off the light in the car.
You get some sleep.

898
01:19:49.966 --> 01:19:53.052
I don't wanna sleep.
I asked you a question.

899
01:19:53.219 --> 01:19:56.764
Did I ask you to turn
the lights out in the car?

900
01:19:57.473 --> 01:20:00.852
What are you runnin' away from
all the time?

901
01:20:01.018 --> 01:20:03.771
I wouldn't wash the windows
for my wife, even.

902
01:20:03.896 --> 01:20:08.734
Painted the fireplace,
planted them damn heliotropes...

903
01:20:09.777 --> 01:20:14.740
What are they doin' here? What do you
keep bringin' them around for?

904
01:20:14.907 --> 01:20:17.743
- Gay, I didn't bring 'em here.
- Where are you at?

905
01:20:17.868 --> 01:20:20.997
I don't know where you're at.

906
01:20:21.163 --> 01:20:24.250
Gay, I'm with you. I'm here with you.

907
01:20:27.837 --> 01:20:33.426
What if someday suddenly you turn
around and you don't like me any more?

908
01:20:34.385 --> 01:20:38.889
Like before, when Perce got hurt,
you started to give me a look.

909
01:20:39.598 --> 01:20:44.478
I know that look, and it scares me, Gay.
I couldn't be with strangers any more.

910
01:20:44.645 --> 01:20:49.984
Honey, honey! I got a little mad, that's all.

911
01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:52.653
That don't mean I didn't like you.

912
01:20:53.779 --> 01:20:59.034
Didn't your papa ever spank you, then
pick you up and give you a big kiss?

913
01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:01.495
He did, didn't he?

914
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:06.917
He was never there long enough.
And strangers spanked me for keeps.

915
01:21:07.084 --> 01:21:09.628
Oh, Gay! Love me, love me!

916
01:21:19.888 --> 01:21:22.432
We made up now. OK?

917
01:21:23.517 --> 01:21:26.603
Yeah, OK. OK.

918
01:21:29.147 --> 01:21:31.441
Let's get some sleep.

919
01:21:32.651 --> 01:21:35.737
Yeah. Yeah, we'll make out.

920
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:40.200
I'll farm. Run some cattle maybe.

921
01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:45.997
I'm a pretty good man, Roslyn.
Best man you'll ever see.

922
01:21:46.164 --> 01:21:48.917
I'll show you tomorrow,
up in the mountains.

923
01:21:49.084 --> 01:21:54.089
Not many can keep up with old Gay.
You wait and see.

924
01:22:08.144 --> 01:22:10.230
Help.

925
01:22:17.988 --> 01:22:21.908
- Why is the dog shivering?
- He'll do that up here.

926
01:22:45.848 --> 01:22:49.978
That star... That star is so far away...

927
01:22:50.979 --> 01:22:55.358
.. that by the time the light from it
reaches us here on Earth,...

928
01:22:55.525 --> 01:22:58.361
.. it might not even be up there any more.

929
01:22:58.486 --> 01:23:01.322
Boy, you sure know a lot, don't you, Pilot?

930
01:23:01.489 --> 01:23:05.701
Astronomy is in all the library books,
Perce. Nothin' to it but readin'.

931
01:23:05.827 --> 01:23:09.872
- Still, it's wonderful to know things.
- Knowin' things don't matter much.

932
01:23:09.997 --> 01:23:13.376
- You got somethin' a lot more important.
- What?

933
01:23:13.543 --> 01:23:15.545
You care.

934
01:23:15.711 --> 01:23:19.340
Whatever happens to anybody,
it happens to you.

935
01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:23.344
You're really hooked into the whole thing,
Roslyn. It's a blessing.

936
01:23:23.511 --> 01:23:25.805
People say I'm just nervous.

937
01:23:25.972 --> 01:23:31.310
If it weren't for the nervous people in the
world, we'd all still be eating each other.

938
01:23:31.435 --> 01:23:33.896
I don't know about
you educated people,...

939
01:23:34.063 --> 01:23:38.484
.. but us ignorant folk
gotta hit the sack.

940
01:23:45.866 --> 01:23:49.245
- Why is the dog trembling?
- Got a whiff of the horses, I guess.

941
01:23:49.411 --> 01:23:52.832
- They must be close by, Guido.
- Baby... Baby...

942
01:23:55.084 --> 01:23:58.546
- Keep quiet, you fool!
- Oh, don't, Gay. He couldn't help it.

943
01:23:58.712 --> 01:24:04.134
- Have the horses ever kicked him?
- It's not the horses he's afraid of. It's us.

944
01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:08.389
What are you talkin' about? I never
mistreated that dog, and you know it.

945
01:24:08.555 --> 01:24:13.185
It's only common sense, Gay.
He knows there's wild animals up there.

946
01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:16.438
Dogs were wild too, once.
He's just remembering when.

947
01:24:17.481 --> 01:24:20.359
He's been up here enough times
to know what will happen.

948
01:24:20.526 --> 01:24:24.154
He's just scared
he's gonna end up dead too.

949
01:24:25.197 --> 01:24:29.827
Uh, come on, honey. Keep yourself
nice and warm here by the fire.

950
01:24:32.579 --> 01:24:34.873
You kill them?

951
01:24:37.668 --> 01:24:40.337
No, no. We, uh... sell 'em to the dealer.

952
01:24:41.463 --> 01:24:43.715
He kills them?

953
01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:49.221
Well, they're chicken-feed horses.
You know, turn 'em into dog food.

954
01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:52.766
Like you buy in the store
for the dog and the cat.

955
01:24:54.935 --> 01:24:58.980
Well, I thought you knew that.
Everybody knows that.

956
01:25:02.192 --> 01:25:07.697
Maybe you better sleep on the truck, in
case something comes crawlin' around.

957
01:25:28.218 --> 01:25:30.595
Get some sleep now. Come on.

958
01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:33.723
Honey...

959
01:25:44.776 --> 01:25:49.864
Honey, I just round 'em up
and sell 'em to the dealer. Always have.

960
01:25:51.115 --> 01:25:56.079
There's no need to look at me that way.
You're lookin' at me like I was a stranger.

961
01:25:56.245 --> 01:25:58.081
Honey!

962
01:25:58.247 --> 01:26:00.833
I thought they were used
for riding, or for...

963
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.169
Well, sure, they used to be.

964
01:26:03.336 --> 01:26:08.925
Well, like Christmas presents for kids,
cos they're small horses, you see?

965
01:26:09.092 --> 01:26:11.928
But kids ride motor scooters now.

966
01:26:13.805 --> 01:26:17.517
They're real strong horses, though.
Little as they are.

967
01:26:17.683 --> 01:26:22.271
They bred to 'em for stamina. Mustang
blood pulled all the ploughs in the West.

968
01:26:22.438 --> 01:26:27.151
They couldn't have settled here unless
somebody caught mustang for 'em.

969
01:26:27.318 --> 01:26:29.612
Somehow it all got changed around.

970
01:26:29.779 --> 01:26:35.284
I'm doin' the same thing I always did.
It's just that they changed it around.

971
01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:39.246
But you know what you're doing
isn't right, don't you?

972
01:26:39.413 --> 01:26:43.959
- If I didn't do it, somebody else would.
- I don't care about the others.

973
01:26:44.126 --> 01:26:47.088
You've bought food for my dog.
What did you think was in it?

974
01:26:47.254 --> 01:26:50.549
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Nothin' can live unless somethin' dies.

975
01:26:50.716 --> 01:26:52.718
Oh, stop!

976
01:26:52.885 --> 01:26:56.013
Roslyn, we never kidded, you and I.

977
01:26:56.764 --> 01:26:59.058
Now, I don't want to lose you.

978
01:26:59.225 --> 01:27:04.438
But you gotta help me a bit, cos I can't put
on that this is all as bad as you make it.

979
01:27:04.605 --> 01:27:06.982
All I know is everything else is wages.

980
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:10.903
I hunt these horses to keep myself free.
So I'm a free man.

981
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:13.739
That's why you liked me, isn't it?

982
01:27:14.657 --> 01:27:18.160
- I liked you because you were kind.
- I haven't changed.

983
01:27:18.327 --> 01:27:20.371
Yes. This changes it.

984
01:27:20.537 --> 01:27:23.374
Honey, a kind man can kill.

985
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.793
No. He can't.

986
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:30.506
Well, maybe you have to take
the bad with the good,...

987
01:27:30.631 --> 01:27:33.884
.. else you'll be runnin'
for the rest of your life.

988
01:27:34.051 --> 01:27:39.014
What is there to stop for?
You're just like everybody else.

989
01:27:39.181 --> 01:27:43.310
Yeah, sure. Maybe we're all alike.
Includin' you.

990
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.733
We start out doin' somethin', meanin'
no harm, somethin' naturally in us to do.

991
01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.363
But somewhere along the line it gets
changed around into somethin' bad.

992
01:27:54.529 --> 01:27:56.865
Like dancin' in a nightclub.

993
01:27:57.032 --> 01:27:59.326
You started out just wantin' to dance.

994
01:27:59.493 --> 01:28:04.206
But little by little it turns out that people
ain't interested in how good you danced.

995
01:28:04.372 --> 01:28:07.918
They're gawkin' at you with
somethin' different in their minds.

996
01:28:08.084 --> 01:28:13.340
And they turn it sour, don't they? I could
have looked down my nose at you too.

997
01:28:13.507 --> 01:28:17.552
Showin' yourself off in a nightclub
for so much a night.

998
01:28:17.719 --> 01:28:21.598
But I took my hat off to you,
cos I know the difference.

999
01:28:22.724 --> 01:28:27.187
This... This is how I dance, Roslyn. And
if they make somethin' else out of it,...

1000
01:28:27.354 --> 01:28:31.191
.. well, I can't run the world,
any more than you could.

1001
01:28:35.779 --> 01:28:38.323
You took your hat off to me?

1002
01:28:42.494 --> 01:28:45.246
You mean that, don't you, Gay?

1003
01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:52.212
Good night.

1004
01:29:14.275 --> 01:29:17.195
Shame on you, you old fool.

1005
01:29:23.743 --> 01:29:27.079
I can fly her back in the morning,
if you want me to.

1006
01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:31.834
I was wonderin' how
she agreed to come out here.

1007
01:29:32.001 --> 01:29:34.837
She's got a lot of right,
when you think about it.

1008
01:29:35.004 --> 01:29:38.090
It don't make too much sense
for 15 horses.

1009
01:29:38.257 --> 01:29:42.887
Don't worry yourselves about her.
She's comin' along fine.

1010
01:29:47.224 --> 01:29:51.979
You be quiet now.
Everybody's showin' off.

1011
01:30:24.011 --> 01:30:26.513
OK, OK, Perce. Hold it, hold it.

1012
01:30:28.432 --> 01:30:31.101
Come on, Perce, give me a hand here.

1013
01:30:32.686 --> 01:30:34.938
Look, Gay. He's not snapping any more.

1014
01:30:35.105 --> 01:30:39.234
Yeah, things generally
look different in the morning.

1015
01:30:51.288 --> 01:30:53.707
Try and chase 'em
down the old mine road.

1016
01:30:53.874 --> 01:30:55.917
OK, Gay, I'm ready.

1017
01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.628
How do you want her?

1018
01:30:58.795 --> 01:31:00.797
That way.

1019
01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:24.446
Boy, that's some jacket.
Pretty breezy, though, isn't it?

1020
01:31:24.613 --> 01:31:30.869
Been on a lot of missions in this thing.
I wouldn't take $100 for it. It's bulletproof.

1021
01:31:31.036 --> 01:31:35.081
I wish you were comin' along with me.
You'd see some real flyin'.

1022
01:31:36.291 --> 01:31:40.170
Probably never see this again
in history, you know.

1023
01:31:44.007 --> 01:31:46.760
- OK, Gay.
- Switch off?

1024
01:31:46.885 --> 01:31:49.471
Throttle closed, switch off.

1025
01:31:52.599 --> 01:31:55.268
Turn your partner, boy. Do-si-do.

1026
01:31:56.394 --> 01:31:59.480
- Once more, con amore!
- Here we go.

1027
01:31:59.939 --> 01:32:01.941
Contact.

1028
01:32:04.777 --> 01:32:08.281
That lousy car gas! All right, try it again.

1029
01:32:10.074 --> 01:32:12.076
Contact.

1030
01:35:33.943 --> 01:35:36.362
It's like a dream.

1031
01:35:37.738 --> 01:35:41.868
I seen a picture of the moon once.
Looked just like this.

1032
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:45.329
- You want up?
- Yes.

1033
01:35:46.831 --> 01:35:51.585
- He'll drive the horses out of that pass.
- Who owns this land?

1034
01:35:51.752 --> 01:35:55.298
Government, probably.
Might as well call it God's country.

1035
01:35:55.464 --> 01:35:57.550
- You see anything?
- Uh-uh.

1036
01:35:57.717 --> 01:36:02.430
How quiet it is. You can hear
your skin against your clothes.

1037
01:36:03.347 --> 01:36:08.018
You're lookin' real good, honey. What
do you say we go into Reno tonight?

1038
01:36:08.185 --> 01:36:09.395
OK.

1039
01:36:09.562 --> 01:36:14.483
I forgot to tell you something last night.
Cow outfits use the pasture up here.

1040
01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:17.653
They shoot mustang
and leave 'em for the buzzards.

1041
01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:21.198
Cos they eat all the good feed.
You know that, don't you, Perce?

1042
01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:24.368
- Huh? Yeah, I know that.
- Why didn't you say so?

1043
01:36:24.493 --> 01:36:26.495
I just said so.

1044
01:36:26.662 --> 01:36:30.791
They're nothin' but misfit horses.
I wish you'd been here in the old days.

1045
01:36:30.916 --> 01:36:34.378
I seen 'em pour out of those passes
400, 500 at a time.

1046
01:36:34.545 --> 01:36:37.589
We'd build a corral and funnel 'em into it.

1047
01:36:37.756 --> 01:36:42.928
Some of 'em were real beautiful animals.
Made sweet ridin' horses.

1048
01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:46.348
- I wish I'd been here then.
- I hear something.

1049
01:36:46.515 --> 01:36:48.976
- What?
- Engine, sounds like.

1050
01:36:49.143 --> 01:36:51.353
- Where?
- Out there.

1051
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.189
No, it's too soon.
He wouldn't be in the pass yet.

1052
01:36:54.356 --> 01:36:57.276
- Listen. I hear him.
- There he is!

1053
01:36:57.401 --> 01:36:59.403
Gay, look!

1054
01:37:01.029 --> 01:37:04.533
I'd have seen him,
but I didn't expect him so soon.

1055
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:08.287
Oh, I seen him glinting against the sun.
That's what it was.

1056
01:37:08.453 --> 01:37:10.455
What's that?

1057
01:37:10.622 --> 01:37:14.751
He fired a shot.
Hey, you got good eyes, old boy.

1058
01:37:14.876 --> 01:37:17.170
Uh-oh. Here they come.

1059
01:37:17.337 --> 01:37:21.466
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1060
01:37:22.259 --> 01:37:26.638
- I guess he'll go back for the rest now.
- Let me have a look.

1061
01:37:28.682 --> 01:37:30.934
- You see the rest yet?
- No.

1062
01:37:31.101 --> 01:37:35.397
Six. It looks like a stallion and four mares.

1063
01:37:36.565 --> 01:37:39.693
- And a little colt.
- You sure?

1064
01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:42.279
Yeah. A spring foal.

1065
01:37:43.697 --> 01:37:47.033
Yeah. It's a colt all right, Gay.

1066
01:37:48.284 --> 01:37:50.787
Want a look?

1067
01:38:00.088 --> 01:38:02.590
Maybe it's cooler in the truck.

1068
01:38:07.303 --> 01:38:09.597
It's all right. She's gonna make it.

1069
01:38:09.764 --> 01:38:12.225
You said there'd be fifteen.
There are only six.

1070
01:38:12.392 --> 01:38:15.061
Ah, probably lost a few. That'll happen.

1071
01:38:15.186 --> 01:38:17.689
It don't make much sense for six, does it?

1072
01:38:17.855 --> 01:38:20.942
Six is six. Better than wages, ain't it?

1073
01:38:21.943 --> 01:38:27.824
- I said it's better than wages, ain't it?
- Sure. Anything's better than wages.

1074
01:38:29.492 --> 01:38:34.622
Perce, I know a place about 100 miles
northeast, Thighbone Mountain.

1075
01:38:35.498 --> 01:38:37.875
Must be at least 500 head in there.

1076
01:38:38.042 --> 01:38:42.255
I never bothered with 'em cos it's tough
to get 'em out. You have to horseback in.

1077
01:38:42.421 --> 01:38:47.760
I don't know, Gay. To tell you the truth,
I don't even know about rodeos any more.

1078
01:38:47.927 --> 01:38:51.180
Boy, I'm beginnin'
to smell wages all over you.

1079
01:38:51.347 --> 01:38:54.433
Sure wish my old man hadn't died.

1080
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.770
When you get through wishin',
all there is is a man's work.

1081
01:38:57.937 --> 01:39:00.189
And there ain't much of that left.

1082
01:39:00.356 --> 01:39:03.275
Come on, give me a hand with this drum.

1083
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:28.300
Come on, Perce, let's get these stakes in.

1084
01:40:08.799 --> 01:40:13.095
Come on, Dooley.
Come on, dog. Here, Dooley.

1085
01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.656
Come on, Perce.

1086
01:40:39.871 --> 01:40:42.123
Let's go, boy!

1087
01:41:04.062 --> 01:41:08.274
You grab hold now.
We're gonna do a lot of fast turning.

1088
01:41:31.339 --> 01:41:33.800
Throw again, Perce!

1089
01:41:37.929 --> 01:41:40.056
Get that horse, cowboy.

1090
01:41:42.767 --> 01:41:44.936
That's the way!

1091
01:42:04.705 --> 01:42:07.208
Attaboy, Gay!

1092
01:42:34.318 --> 01:42:36.737
Get that horse!

1093
01:43:02.429 --> 01:43:04.890
Attaboy, Gay!

1094
01:43:09.603 --> 01:43:12.105
- Well, here's the big chief.
- What?

1095
01:43:12.272 --> 01:43:14.149
The stallion.

1096
01:43:31.958 --> 01:43:34.503
Get that horse, cowboy.

1097
01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:37.964
That's the way.

1098
01:43:44.638 --> 01:43:49.976
We'll tie 'em up now, and open their
nooses so they won't choke overnight.

1099
01:43:50.101 --> 01:43:54.147
- Overnight?
- The dealer'll pick 'em up in the morning.

1100
01:44:10.872 --> 01:44:12.874
Perce?

1101
01:44:15.001 --> 01:44:18.087
- Were those his mares?
- Uh-huh.

1102
01:44:18.254 --> 01:44:20.423
Was that his colt?

1103
01:44:23.593 --> 01:44:25.762
Perce, get in here.

1104
01:45:46.258 --> 01:45:49.178
- Gay, why are you killing him?
- Stand aside, honey.

1105
01:45:49.345 --> 01:45:54.683
- OK, you won! All right, you've won!
- Let go of that rope! Get outta here!

1106
01:45:54.808 --> 01:45:58.395
- Gay, darling...
- Pull him! Choke him down, Guido!

1107
01:45:59.063 --> 01:46:01.648
- Get off me, Roslyn.
- Stop it!

1108
01:46:03.358 --> 01:46:06.528
- Roslyn!
- Shut up and pull that horse down!

1109
01:46:06.695 --> 01:46:10.115
Come on! One, two... Go!

1110
01:46:55.368 --> 01:46:59.122
Well, I guess comin' up here
for the first time like her,...

1111
01:46:59.289 --> 01:47:02.876
.. there might not seem much sense to it,
for only five horses.

1112
01:47:03.168 --> 01:47:05.712
Not knowin' how it used to be.

1113
01:47:06.338 --> 01:47:11.509
I never thought of it, but I guess
the fewer you kill, the worse it looks.

1114
01:47:14.429 --> 01:47:17.432
What do you say
we give her these horses?

1115
01:47:18.808 --> 01:47:24.606
How much do you want for 'em? I'll pay
you. I'll give you $200. Is that enough?

1116
01:47:33.406 --> 01:47:38.161
- Let's get in the truck.
- Gay, you was about to give 'em to her.

1117
01:47:38.328 --> 01:47:43.041
I did think of it, but I sell to dealers only.
Cos all they're lookin' to buy is a horse.

1118
01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:45.960
- I didn't mean to insult you, Gay.
- No insult.

1119
01:47:46.127 --> 01:47:50.590
I'm just wonderin' who you think
you've been talkin' to since we met.

1120
01:48:16.991 --> 01:48:19.410
Brother, what a day.

1121
01:48:19.869 --> 01:48:24.415
I nearly hit a mountain back there.
Cylinder cut out at the bottom of a dive.

1122
01:48:24.582 --> 01:48:26.625
Squirtin' oil.

1123
01:48:26.792 --> 01:48:30.045
Boy, that's the closest
I ever come, I tell ya.

1124
01:48:31.464 --> 01:48:34.633
Listen, do you want me to stop this?

1125
01:48:36.469 --> 01:48:40.389
I know how you feel, Roslyn.
I never liked this part myself.

1126
01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:44.268
Truthfully, the only part
I enjoyed is the flying.

1127
01:48:44.977 --> 01:48:47.313
You want me to stop it?

1128
01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:51.442
- You would?
- You're through with Gay now, right?

1129
01:48:52.818 --> 01:48:57.906
Well, tell me. He doesn't know what
you're all about. He'll never know.

1130
01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:04.121
Tell me, Roslyn. I been waitin'.
I'm goin' out of my mind with waitin'.

1131
01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:11.003
Come back with me. Give me a week,
two weeks. Let me show you what I am.

1132
01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:15.591
Tell me, Roslyn.
Give me a reason and I'll stop it.

1133
01:49:16.175 --> 01:49:19.720
There'll be hell to pay,
but give me a reason and I'll do it.

1134
01:49:19.887 --> 01:49:26.101
A reason? You, a sensitive fellow.
So sad for his wife.

1135
01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:30.105
Crying about the bombs you dropped
and the people you killed.

1136
01:49:30.272 --> 01:49:33.025
You have to get something to be human?

1137
01:49:33.191 --> 01:49:38.405
You never felt anything for anybody in
your life. All you know is the sad words.

1138
01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:43.744
You could blow up the world,
and all you'd feel is sorry for yourself!

1139
01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:16.985
- She's an old one.
- Fifteen if she's a day.

1140
01:50:17.152 --> 01:50:19.904
She wouldn't last through the winter.

1141
01:50:57.442 --> 01:51:01.487
We'll tie down the other three
on the way back.

1142
01:51:01.779 --> 01:51:05.616
- What do you think this mare'll weigh?
- About 600 pounds, I guess.

1143
01:51:05.783 --> 01:51:10.079
- Must be about 400 on that brown, huh?
- Just about, yeah.

1144
01:51:10.538 --> 01:51:13.040
Must be about 800 on the stallion.

1145
01:51:13.749 --> 01:51:18.045
- A little lighter. About 1900, 2000 pounds.
- How does that all come out?

1146
01:51:18.212 --> 01:51:22.091
Well, six cents a pound,
be about $110, $120.

1147
01:51:22.258 --> 01:51:25.428
- How do you wanna cut it up?
- Any way you like.

1148
01:51:25.594 --> 01:51:28.889
- I'll take 50 for myself and the plane.
- OK.

1149
01:51:29.056 --> 01:51:32.393
I ought to have about 40
for the truck and me.

1150
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.980
That leaves 25 for you, Perce.
That all right?

1151
01:51:36.147 --> 01:51:37.940
Perce!

1152
01:51:38.107 --> 01:51:43.195
No. You fellas take it.
I just came along for the ride anyway.

1153
01:51:43.362 --> 01:51:45.197
Horse killers!

1154
01:51:45.364 --> 01:51:48.117
Killers! Murderers!

1155
01:51:48.576 --> 01:51:51.829
You're liars! All of you, liars!

1156
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:56.125
You're only happy
when you can see something die!

1157
01:51:56.292 --> 01:51:59.211
Why don't you kill yourselves
and be happy?!

1158
01:51:59.378 --> 01:52:02.381
You and your God's country! Freedom!

1159
01:52:03.257 --> 01:52:08.095
I pity you! You're three
dear, sweet, dead men!

1160
01:52:11.515 --> 01:52:14.435
She's crazy. They're all crazy.

1161
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:19.982
You try not to believe it because
you need them. She's crazy.

1162
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:25.946
You struggle, you build, you try,
you turn yourself inside out for 'em.

1163
01:52:26.113 --> 01:52:29.992
But it's never enough.
So they put the spurs to you.

1164
01:52:30.701 --> 01:52:34.454
I know. I got the marks.
I know this racket.

1165
01:52:34.621 --> 01:52:39.793
- I just forgot what I knew for a little while.
- Butchers! Murderers!

1166
01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:43.630
I pity you! You're three dead men!

1167
01:53:05.694 --> 01:53:08.196
Hold this light for me, will you?

1168
01:53:17.789 --> 01:53:23.044
Buck up, boy. Before you know it
you'll be up to your neck in dames again.

1169
01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:27.173
I just been thinkin'.
I don't know how we got so stupid.

1170
01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:30.468
The world is full of mountains.

1171
01:53:30.635 --> 01:53:37.100
Montana, Colorado, Canada, even Mexico.
Where there's mountains, there's horses.

1172
01:53:37.267 --> 01:53:41.020
Probably we could clean 'em all out
till we're too weak to walk.

1173
01:53:41.187 --> 01:53:45.441
We'd work a while and...
I could even sell my house.

1174
01:53:45.608 --> 01:53:48.528
I don't know what I've been
keepin' it for anyway.

1175
01:53:48.653 --> 01:53:53.116
Put everything into a good plane.
We'll get this thing on a business basis.

1176
01:53:53.241 --> 01:53:56.911
For instance, we ought to water
those horses before we weigh 'em in.

1177
01:53:57.078 --> 01:54:00.164
Put 50 pounds on just these five
if we let 'em drink.

1178
01:54:00.331 --> 01:54:03.543
- We just been foolin' around.
- I wanna get out of here. Come on.

1179
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:07.380
No. With a good plane you could
fly into Reno from anywhere.

1180
01:54:07.547 --> 01:54:11.592
Check into the Mapes,
have a good time, and off we go again.

1181
01:54:11.759 --> 01:54:14.220
Boy, we wouldn't need anybody.
I tell you...

1182
01:54:14.387 --> 01:54:18.224
Why don't you shut up, Guido?
Just shut up, huh?

1183
01:54:39.245 --> 01:54:44.500
- Do you want me to turn 'em loose?
- No. There'd just be a fight.

1184
01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:03.978
I'll meet you at the dealer's.
We'll get his winch truck.

1185
01:55:04.144 --> 01:55:07.690
Don't spin the prop till I check the switch.

1186
01:55:19.243 --> 01:55:22.538
- Switch off?
- Switch off. Throttle closed.

1187
01:55:26.542 --> 01:55:29.628
Contact.

1188
01:55:43.183 --> 01:55:45.185
Gay!

1189
01:56:44.744 --> 01:56:47.413
Go home. Go.

1190
01:58:38.065 --> 01:58:40.275
Help him, Perce.

1191
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:51.161
He don't want no help.

1192
01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:18.313
Gay?

1193
02:00:30.426 --> 02:00:33.512
You held him.
I'm proud of ya, boy. You held him.

1194
02:00:33.638 --> 02:00:38.893
We'll get them all back tomorrow. Just get
your wind back now. Get your wind back.

1195
02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:43.522
Don't worry, we're not through here.
We're only gettin' started.

1196
02:00:43.689 --> 02:00:48.235
We don't need anybody in the world.
You know that now, don't you?

1197
02:00:55.117 --> 02:00:57.411
What are you doin'?

1198
02:01:10.299 --> 02:01:13.052
What in the hell you catch him for?

1199
02:01:14.803 --> 02:01:18.932
Don't want nobody makin' up
my mind for me, that's all.

1200
02:01:20.559 --> 02:01:22.686
Damn 'em all!

1201
02:01:22.853 --> 02:01:28.609
They changed it. Changed it all around.
Smeared it all over with blood.

1202
02:01:31.028 --> 02:01:33.363
Well, I'm finished with it.

1203
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:38.368
It's... It's like ropin' a dream now.

1204
02:01:41.079 --> 02:01:45.042
Just gotta find another way
to be alive, that's all.

1205
02:01:45.209 --> 02:01:47.586
If there is one any more.

1206
02:01:50.547 --> 02:01:54.426
Perce, cut that mare loose
for me, will you?

1207
02:01:54.593 --> 02:01:56.595
Sure.

1208
02:02:03.226 --> 02:02:05.687
Drive you back, if you want.

1209
02:02:15.906 --> 02:02:18.867
Um, I'm pleased to have met you, Roslyn.

1210
02:02:20.035 --> 02:02:23.330
Don't get hurt any more, will you, Perce?

1211
02:02:29.419 --> 02:02:34.049
- See you around, Guido.
- Where'll you be? Polishin' windshields?

1212
02:02:34.215 --> 02:02:36.343
Makin' change in a supermarket?

1213
02:02:36.509 --> 02:02:41.473
Try the Laundromat! They need a fella
there to load the machines!

1214
02:02:41.639 --> 02:02:43.183
Gay!

1215
02:02:58.781 --> 02:03:01.367
I'll leave tomorrow. OK?

1216
02:03:36.319 --> 02:03:38.821
I bless you, girl.

1217
02:04:01.719 --> 02:04:05.389
Gay, if there could be
one person in the world,...

1218
02:04:05.556 --> 02:04:09.894
.. a child who could be brave
from the beginning...

1219
02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:14.857
I was scared to when you asked me.
But I'm not so much now. Are you?

1220
02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.901
No.

1221
02:04:19.862 --> 02:04:23.240
How do you find
your way back in the dark?

1222
02:04:24.908 --> 02:04:27.911
Just head for that big star straight on.

1223
02:04:28.579 --> 02:04:30.789
The highway's under it.

1224
02:04:31.457 --> 02:04:34.042
It'll take us right home.
