1
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.143
Young man, do you have the time?

2
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.697
I got six clocks in the house,
and none of them work.

3
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:21.864
Twenty after 9:00.

4
00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.451
After? It's 20 after, dear.

5
00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.114
-Dar|ing!
-Five minutes. What about you?

6
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.075
I‘m all set. Ijust ironed my sling.

7
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.795
The lawyer said 9:30 sharp, darling.

8
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.372
Okay.

9
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.845
I hope you‘re not miserly. It's brand-new.
She ought to get a good price for it.

10
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.799
Is that the right mileage? 23 miles?

11
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.094
Yeah. We only took two rides in it.

12
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:54.147
Men keep running into her
to start a conversation.

13
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.983
-Will you come up here?
-Sure, dear.

14
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.691
It's brand-new.

15
00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.485
It was a divorce present from her husband.

16
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.492
-They‘re giving presents for divorces now?
-Why not?

17
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:10.827
On the anniversary of our divorce, my
husband sends me a potted yellow rose.

18
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.830
It'll be 19 years in July.

19
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.662
He never did pay me alimony,

20
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.924
but I wouldn‘t want to put a man out
if his heart's not in it.

21
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.668
Did you break your arm in the car?

22
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.678
No. My last roomer,
the one before Mrs. Taber,

23
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:31.347
we celebrated her divorce

24
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.095
and I misbehaved.

25
00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:38.184
I‘m so sick and tired of myself.

26
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.074
He cruelly ignored my personal rights

27
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:50.200
and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me.

28
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:55.618
He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal rights and wishes.

29
00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:59.204
-Will you go over my answers with me?
-Sure, but don’t worry.

30
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.005
You'll do wonderfully.

31
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.419
Let‘s see.

32
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:07.550
"Did your husband, Mr. Raymond Taber,
act toward you with cruelty?"

33
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.923
Darling?

34
00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:11.974
Well, yes.

35
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.559
Just say yes.

36
00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:14.887
Yes.

37
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.765
"In what way
did this cruelty manifest itself?“

38
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.313
He persistently...

39
00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.574
How does that go again?

40
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.829
"He persistently and cruelly ignored
my personal wishes and my rights

41
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.250
"and resorted on several occasions
to physical violence against me."

42
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.752
He persistently...

43
00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.248
Do I have to say that?

44
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:48.220
Why can't I just say he wasn't there?

45
00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.887
You could touch him, but he wasn't there.

46
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.435
Darling girl, if that was grounds for divorce,

47
00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.772
there‘d only be about 11 marriages left
in the United States.

48
00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:00.557
Just repeat after me.

49
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.350
He persistently...

50
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.690
He persistently...

51
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.782
They'll call in their estimate from the office.

52
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.486
Those dents aren‘t my fault, you know.

53
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.706
I'll recommend the best price I can, ma'am.

54
00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.994
You can drive her. I put in a new battery.

55
00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:22.166
I'll never drive it again.

56
00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:23.834
Let‘s take a taxi.

57
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:28.131
-I‘II give you a lift if you're leaving now.
-Swell. Two minutes.

58
00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.837
lz, get dressed. You‘re my witness!

59
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:36.267
This will be my 77th time
I‘ve witnessed for a divorce.

60
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.729
Two 7s! That's lucky, darling!

61
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.853
I hope.

62
00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:58.870
-Easy does it, now.
-You're a dear.

63
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.496
Here we are.

64
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.661
Thanks a lot. We got to go now.

65
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:07.007
If you're not going back east right away,
I'd like to show you around.

66
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.300
Beautiful country around here.

67
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:13.426
I don't know where I'll be, but okay.
Thanks again.

68
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.848
My name is Isabelle Steers.

69
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.181
Isabelle. Well, you come along, too.

70
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.972
That's a sweet afterthought.

71
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.058
You Reno men.

72
00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.525
I can’t memorize this. It‘s not true.

73
00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.032
Just say it. It doesn't have to be true.

74
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.656
It's only a court, not a quiz show.

75
00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.371
I just got here. I‘m not late, am I?

76
00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:50.129
-I don't want to hear.
-Just five minutes. After two years...

77
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.719
You can‘t have me, so you want me.

78
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.297
Please. I'm not blaming you.

79
00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.933
I just don't believe
in the whole thing anymore.

80
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.682
Kid, I understand.

81
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.564
You don‘t understand. You're not there.

82
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.060
If I'm going to be alone,
I want to be by myself.

83
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.984
Go back. You won't make me
feel sorry for you anymore.

84
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.412
Gay!

85
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.170
Wait! I was just going to see you.

86
00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.084
Good luck, Susan.

87
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:36.171
I won't forget you. You can be sure of that.

88
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.591
I don't even know where to write you.

89
00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.851
General delivery. I‘ll get it.

90
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.561
Will you think about it?

91
00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.063
It's the second largest laundry in St. Louis.

92
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.312
I ain‘t cut out for business.

93
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.654
Will you think of me? Gay!

94
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.818
You know I will, honey.

95
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.441
Good-bye.

96
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.781
Bye.

97
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.467
How are you doing?

98
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.882
You ready to cut out of this town? I am.

99
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.838
I've been thinking about it.

100
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.056
Which one was that?

101
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:24.102
Susan. Swell sport, that woman.

102
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.639
I just met me a girl sweet enough to eat.

103
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.815
A fine-looking woman.

104
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.359
Trouble is, all the useless talking
you got to do gets me discouraged.

105
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:38.863
I‘m dying for fresh air
and no people, male or female.

106
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.288
Let‘s take out to the mountains,
do some mustanging.

107
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.995
I wanted to pile up $500.

108
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.002
-I want a new engine.
-Yours will fly you anywhere.

109
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:52.335
You've been working two months.
You're getting the habit.

110
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.425
I'll see you at Harrahs later.
Let's talk about it.

111
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.680
Tom Dooley.

112
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.869
If you throw in your ring,
you'll never get another divorce.

113
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.826
Go ahead, honey. Everybody does it.

114
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.333
More gold in that river
than there is in the Klondike.

115
00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.550
Did you do that?

116
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.508
Who, me? No.
I lost my ring on my honeymoon.

117
00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:46.722
-Let's get a drink.
-That‘s my girl.

118
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.936
Wait a minute, honey.
This machine loves me.

119
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.536
Never say die.

120
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.091
Scotch, I guess, on ice. Yeah, on ice.

121
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.259
Rye and water.

122
00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.139
Scotch on ice, rye and water.

123
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.812
Cheer up.

124
00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.395
I will. I just hate to fight with anybody.

125
00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:38.611
When you win, you lose,
you know, in your heart.

126
00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.147
You're free.

127
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.153
Maybe the trouble is
you're not used to it yet.

128
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.737
The trouble is
I always end up back where I started.

129
00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:51.575
I never had anybody much. Here I am.

130
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.752
You had your mother, didn't you?

131
00:11:57.133 --> 00:12:00.591
How do you have somebody
who disappears all the time?

132
00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.503
They both weren't there.

133
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.473
She'd go off with a patient
for three months.

134
00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.351
You know how long
three months is to a kid.

135
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.517
Listen...

136
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.395
Don't leave, settle here.

137
00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.648
They got a school.
You could teach dancing.

138
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:24.616
One thing about this town,
it's always full of interesting strangers.

139
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.080
I‘m sorry. What did I say?

140
00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.497
I suddenly miss my mother.

141
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.212
Isn't that the stupidest thing?

142
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.002
Iz, you're a fine woman.

143
00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:47.214
You're practically the only woman
who's ever been my friend.

144
00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.007
Drink up, kid.

145
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.472
Isn‘t that the dearest dog?

146
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.436
Look how sweet he sits there.

147
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.901
Yeah. Dogs are nice.

148
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.187
Here.

149
00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.818
Puppy.

150
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.201
Here, puppy.

151
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.239
Hey, Dooley.

152
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:21.673
Hello. How did you make out?

153
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.546
Okay.

154
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.883
I‘d like you to meet a friend of mine. Gay?

155
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.720
Gay Langland, Mrs. Taber.

156
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:38.890
How do you do?

157
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:42.360
-And this is Mrs...
-Steers. Isabelle Steers.

158
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.693
One thing about Reno men,
they remember names.

159
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:47.695
Why don't you sit down?

160
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.700
Thank you.

161
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.495
-What are you girls drinking?
-Whiskey.

162
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.407
We're celebrating, the jail burned down.

163
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.958
Mary, get four doubles, will you?

164
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:06.251
You sure made a big impression
on my friend here

165
00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.885
and I can see why.

166
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.929
You a mechanic, too?

167
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.090
Him? He‘s a cowboy.

168
00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.097
-How did you know?
-I can smell, can‘t I?

169
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.311
You can‘t smell cows on me.

170
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.269
I can smell the look on your face, cowboy,

171
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:23.477
but I love every miserable one of you.

172
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.775
You're all good-for-nothing, as you know.

173
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.611
That may be, but it‘s better than wages.

174
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.702
I suppose you‘re heading back east?

175
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.076
I can't make up my mind. I don't know.

176
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:39.204
You don‘t have a business or...

177
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.126
I never finished high school.

178
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.797
That's real good news.

179
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.129
You don‘t like educated women?

180
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.761
They're okay, but always want to know
what you're thinking.

181
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.886
Maybe they want to know you better.

182
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:57.139
Did you ever know a man better
by asking questions?

183
00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:00.805
You mean he'd lie?

184
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.983
He might not,
and then again, he just might.

185
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.155
Say, Pilot, we taking off today?

186
00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:12.366
You ever been outside Reno, Mrs. Taber?

187
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:15.661
Once I walked to the edge of town.
Not much there.

188
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.325
Everything's there.

189
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.115
Like what?

190
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:20.832
The country.

191
00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.664
What do you do?

192
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.207
Just live.

193
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.377
How do you "just live"?

194
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.835
You start by going to sleep.

195
00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:32.587
You get up when you feel like it.
You scratch yourself.

196
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.381
You fry some eggs.
You see what kind of a day it is.

197
00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:37.341
You throw stones at a can and whistle.

198
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.392
I know what you mean.

199
00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.270
I have an empty house
just beyond Hawleyville.

200
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:49.195
It‘s all yours
if you want some peace and quiet.

201
00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.614
The last woman‘s gone?

202
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:56.157
No kidding. I never offered it before.

203
00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:01.749
I wouldn‘t stay there, but let's rent a car.
We'll look at the country.

204
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.872
Gay has a truck. You can have my car.

205
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.455
-No. Then you‘ll have to drive me back.
-I don't mind.

206
00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:10.208
No, thanks. I like to feel I'm on my own.

207
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:13.044
-Where can I rent a car?
-Now?

208
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.050
Why not?

209
00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:18.257
Okay! You sure don't waste your time.

210
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.478
I've just got to quit my job.

211
00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.681
Hey, that's the boy.

212
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:29.064
No, Gay. This is mine.

213
00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:46.999
What is that beautiful smell?
It smells like green perfume.

214
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.750
That‘s sage, Darling.

215
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.674
Sure. I never smelled it except in bottles.

216
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.591
-It‘s beautiful here.
-Look, dear girl,

217
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:59.306
I think I'd better tell you something
about cowboys.

218
00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:03.436
-You really worry about me, don‘t you?
-You’re too believing.

219
00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:07.143
Cowboys are the last real men
left in the world

220
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:10.276
and they‘re about as
reliable as jack rabbits.

221
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.274
Is anybody different?

222
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:17.279
Maybe you‘re not supposed to believe what
people say. Maybe it's not fair to them.

223
00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.161
I couldn‘t hear what he said

224
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.282
but it looked like she left him, the husband.

225
00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.499
She's kind of hard to figure out, you know?

226
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:33.083
One minute she looks kind of dumb
and brand-new, like a kid,

227
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.880
and the next minute, she...

228
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.632
She‘s real prime.

229
00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.159
Why, it isn't finished yet.

230
00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.168
It's weather-tight. Come in.

231
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:11.996
It's insulated.

232
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.759
Flush doors.

233
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.134
This is the living room.

234
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.517
This was going to be another bedroom.

235
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.187
It's even nice this way.

236
00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.724
Here's a picture window.

237
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.980
Take a look at this view.

238
00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.575
Look at that.

239
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:45.779
It goes on forever.

240
00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.826
Fireplace.

241
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.038
-Brick.
-This is the kitchen.

242
00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.711
Gas refrigerator.

243
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:57.049
Looks nice.

244
00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.006
And here's the bathroom. Ceramic tile.

245
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.799
And here's our...

246
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.134
This was our bedroom.

247
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.269
My wife.

248
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:11.601
She died here.

249
00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.440
I‘m sorry.

250
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:18.945
She was due to have a baby.

251
00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.033
I was setting the capstone on the chimney

252
00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.782
and she screamed

253
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:29.240
and that was that.

254
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.163
Couldn‘t you call a doctor?

255
00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.415
She didn‘t seem to be that sick.

256
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:40.801
Then I got a flat. I didn't have a spare.

257
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.596
Everything just happened wrong.

258
00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.764
It'll do that sometimes.

259
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.597
Yeah. I know.

260
00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:51.600
You couldn't live here anymore?

261
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.900
We knew each other
since we were 7 years old, see?

262
00:19:57.071 --> 00:19:59.278
You ought to find yourself another girl.

263
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:00.980
I don't know.

264
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:04.738
Being with anybody else,
it seems impossible, you know?

265
00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.779
She wasn't like any other women.

266
00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:11.119
Stood behind me 100%,
uncomplaining as a tree.

267
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.669
Maybe that's what killed her.

268
00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:20.299
I mean, a little complaining
helps sometimes, maybe.

269
00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:23.503
Isn't this a beautiful place here?

270
00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.632
Yeah, it would be perfect
if someone would get that whiskey

271
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:29.550
I bought with my money.

272
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:30.805
Hey, that‘s right!

273
00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:34.104
And bring the groceries.
Maybe somebody is hungry.

274
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:38.685
The glasses are in the kitchen.
I'm real tired.

275
00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.362
You're just a cowboy, darling.

276
00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:45.240
You fellas won't move
unless it’s raining down your necks.

277
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.117
Too rough for you, Roslyn?

278
00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.662
I don’t mind that.

279
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.080
You should have seen his wife.

280
00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:59.334
She helped pour cement
and knocked in nails.

281
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.123
She was a real good sport.

282
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.044
Now she's dead
because he didn't have a spare tire.

283
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.089
That's the way it goes.

284
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:12.180
It goes the other way, too.
Don't forget that.

285
00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:14.933
It's sure nice to see people again.

286
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:18.812
Come on, let‘s have a drink.
The refrigerator makes ice quick.

287
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.188
Ice?

288
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.812
-We‘re staying that long?
-I don‘t know.

289
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:26.732
Come on! There's no better place to be.

290
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.405
You couldn't find better company.

291
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.705
-All right.
-That‘s it, sport.

292
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:37.202
Turn on the ice. Let‘s get this stuff
flowing, make the desert bloom.

293
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.545
Flow it slow. We only got one bottle.

294
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:43.216
There you are, put that in your thoughts
and see how they come out.

295
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.548
Sit down, everybody.
Let‘s get comfortable.

296
00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:53.308
I'm sure glad you like this place.

297
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:55.761
Here's to Nevada, the leave-it state.

298
00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.605
-The what?
-Leave-it.

299
00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:01.400
You got money to gamble, leave it here.

300
00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:03.978
Get rid of your wife here.

301
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.820
Blow it up here, no one will mind a bit.

302
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:13.454
The slogan of Nevada is, "Anything goes,
but don't complain if it went.“

303
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.622
That's no lie.

304
00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:17.616
I left my southern accent here.

305
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:22.960
How come you never went back home
after your divorce?

306
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:26.000
-I wasn't beautiful enough.
-Isabelle.

307
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.212
That's true. Beauty's a help anyplace,

308
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.634
but in Virginia, it's a necessity.

309
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.388
You can't hardly
get a driver's license without it.

310
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.635
I love Nevada.

311
00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:39.396
They don‘t even have regular mealtimes.

312
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.437
Never met so many people with no watch.

313
00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:46.395
Maybe two wives, but no watch.
Bless them all.

314
00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:49.607
How quiet it is here.

315
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.283
Sweetest sound there is.

316
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.287
There‘s an Indian store about five miles.

317
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.869
It's got groceries, everything.

318
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.121
If you want to stay, that is.

319
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.920
Be glad to come by and do chores.

320
00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:09.802
He reminds me
of that cowboy friend I told you about.

321
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:14.716
Had one arm gone but was more man
with one arm than any man with two.

322
00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.472
I mean like cooking.

323
00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:25.894
He‘d throw a panful of chops up in the air,
and they came down on the other side.

324
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.028
Who is he? Maybe they know him.

325
00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:31.278
Darling, you can't go looking for a man.

326
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.900
He took off?

327
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.656
No, not exactly.

328
00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.704
He just never came back.

329
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.831
Andy Powell. Ever...

330
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.996
Sure. Called Andy Gump sometimes?

331
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.500
That's him!

332
00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.300
-Where is he?
-Saw him at the rodeo only last month.

333
00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:53.095
Maybe we could find him...

334
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.094
Stop thinking you can change things.

335
00:23:56.518 --> 00:23:58.634
If you can do something...

336
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:02.104
I don't know what to do,
but if! knew, I‘d do it.

337
00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:07.568
Have you got a radio
or a phonograph for music?

338
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:09.361
There‘s no electricity.

339
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:11.238
The car radio!

340
00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.023
Who‘d have thought of that?

341
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:15.951
You always get an idea, don‘t you?

342
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.536
I'll go bring the car around.

343
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:23.542
How about another drink
to keep that one warm?

344
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.244
I'd love it.

345
00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:28.748
I‘m making myself a sandwich.
How about you?

346
00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:30.132
Okay.

347
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.712
I hope you‘ll stay on here. Any chance?

348
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.097
Why? What difference would it make?

349
00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:40.972
Might make all the difference in the world,
as time goes by.

350
00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:44.767
Like to dance?

351
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.015
Okay.

352
00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:58.820
Thanks.

353
00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:02.414
Iz, give him another drink.
It's a wonderful house, Guido.

354
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.785
That's pretty good dancing, cowboy.

355
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.536
What are you doing?

356
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:12.167
She used to teach dancing, you know?
Before she was married.

357
00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.551
No kidding. In a dance hall?

358
00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:21.133
How about the landlord? Move over, boy.

359
00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:25.221
-Watch out for those pretty feet.
-She knows how to get out of the way.

360
00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.597
Let‘s go.

361
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:47.246
Where did you learn that, Pilot?

362
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.376
I never knew him to dance at all.

363
00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.837
Look at old Pilot
coming out from under a bushel.

364
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:06.308
You two ought to put on a show.

365
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:38.795
Come on, honey, this is a good one.
I haven’t danced like this in years.

366
00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:44.474
Didn't your wife dance?

367
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.262
Not like you. She had no gracefulness.

368
00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:50.723
Why didn't you teach her?

369
00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:53.183
You can‘t learn that.

370
00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:57.438
How do you know?
I mean, how do you know?

371
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:02.026
You see, she died,
and she didn't know how you can dance.

372
00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:06.121
To a certain extent,
maybe you were strangers.

373
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.950
I don't feel like discussing my wife.

374
00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:10.542
Don't be mad.

375
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:14.922
I only meant, if you loved her,
you could've taught her anything.

376
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.540
Because,

377
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.551
we're all dying, aren‘t we?

378
00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.178
All the husbands and all the wives,

379
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.097
every minute,

380
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:28.181
and we're not teaching each other
what we really know, are we?

381
00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.149
You're a nice man.

382
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.861
Smile.

383
00:27:40.534 --> 00:27:41.990
Come on.

384
00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:17.316
Come on, Iz.

385
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:20.111
I‘m looking for your shoes, dear girl.

386
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.323
Watch out. There's no step.

387
00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:22.420
We better get you home, girl.

388
00:29:23.553 --> 00:29:25.760
You were worried about me.

389
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.971
How sweet.

390
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.425
Just want to keep you all
in one pretty piece.

391
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.640
Would you have had a spare tire?

392
00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:37.014
Somebody better drive her.

393
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.862
Go ahead. I'll take the truck.

394
00:29:44.574 --> 00:29:46.906
No. Don't leave poor Guido alone.

395
00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.029
Tom Dooley.

396
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:28.524
You're a real beautiful woman.

397
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:34.079
It's a kind of an honor sitting next to you.

398
00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:37.533
You just shine, in my eyes.

399
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.081
That's my true feeling.

400
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:47.005
What makes you so sad?

401
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:50.713
I think you're the saddest girl I ever met.

402
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:55.600
You're the first man that ever said that.
I'm usually told how happy I am.

403
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.896
That's because you make a man feel happy.

404
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.652
I don't feel that way about you, Gay.

405
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.783
Don't get discouraged, you might.

406
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:21.584
Why don't you try it here for a while?
See what happens.

407
00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:26.498
Sometimes when you don't know
what to do, the best thing is to stand still.

408
00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:33.305
I'll guarantee you'll have something here
you wouldn't find on every corner.

409
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:39.811
I may not amount to much in some ways

410
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.521
but I am a good friend.

411
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:45.518
Thanks.

412
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.818
Let‘s go back to get your things.

413
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.649
Try it for a while, see what happens.

414
00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:57.951
Did you hear about the city man
in the country?

415
00:31:58.166 --> 00:32:00.498
He sees this fellow sitting on his porch.

416
00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:04.794
He says,
"Could you tell me how to get to town?“

417
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:06.792
The fellow says, "Nope."

418
00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:10.376
"Could you give directions
to the post office?"

419
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.673
The fellow says, "Nope."

420
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.680
"How about the way
to the railroad station?"

421
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.511
"Nope."

422
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.385
"Boy, you sure don‘t know much, do you?"

423
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:24.227
The fellow says, "Nope, but I ain‘t lost."

424
00:32:33.034 --> 00:32:34.774
Don't you have a home?

425
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:40.034
Sure. There never was a better one, either.

426
00:32:40.876 --> 00:32:42.412
Where is it?

427
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:45.578
Right here.

428
00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:44.514
Come on, now.

429
00:33:44.898 --> 00:33:47.105
I got a surprise for you.

430
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.040
You cooked breakfast.

431
00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:17.757
-Here, let me.
-No. You sit and enjoy yourself.

432
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.629
Just this once.

433
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:21.969
You do this often?

434
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.016
First time for me.

435
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:26.891
Really and truly?

436
00:34:28.942 --> 00:34:30.557
Smells delicious.

437
00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:40.321
You really go all out, even the way you eat.

438
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:42.948
I like that. Women generally pick.

439
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.159
You like me?

440
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:50.869
The birds must be brave to live here,

441
00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:53.163
at night especially.

442
00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:54.915
They‘re so small.

443
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:00.011
You think I‘m crazy.

444
00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:02.718
I just can't make you out.

445
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.182
-Why?
-I don't know.

446
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:07.056
You got children?

447
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.556
I never wanted children with him.

448
00:35:14.988 --> 00:35:17.695
Children are supposed
to bring you together

449
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:20.148
but what if they don't, you know?

450
00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:25.871
I‘ve known of so-called
happily married couples.

451
00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:29.199
One time, the wife was in the hospital

452
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:33.586
to have the baby,
and the husband was calling me up.

453
00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:36.540
I mean, he was calling me.

454
00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:41.132
They're still supposed to be
happily married.

455
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:43.547
You believe in true love, don‘t you?

456
00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:45.552
I don't know,

457
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.804
but you shouldn't have children
unless you care for each other.

458
00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:53.811
Because kids know the difference.
I always knew the difference.

459
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:57.690
If you want to go somewhere,
I don’t mind being alone.

460
00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.070
Do I look like I want to leave?

461
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.488
I just mean,
I want you to do what you feel like.

462
00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.615
You ain't kidding.

463
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:09.039
Even when you‘re kidding,
you ain't kidding.

464
00:36:09.626 --> 00:36:12.083
No, it makes me feel peaceful.

465
00:36:14.381 --> 00:36:18.841
They come here from New York, Chicago,
St. Louis, and they find a cowboy.

466
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.921
Cowboys are supposed to be dumb.

467
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:24.262
They tell them everything,
and they do everything,

468
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:26.298
everything they couldn't do back home.

469
00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:29.635
-It‘s pitiful.
-Why?

470
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:32.145
Cowboy's laughing at them,
and they don't know it.

471
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.809
It's nice to meet someone
who has respect for a man.

472
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:40.319
Did you ever think of remarrying?

473
00:36:41.449 --> 00:36:44.862
Yeah, I've thought about it a lot of times,
but never in daylight.

474
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.993
You miss your children?

475
00:36:51.084 --> 00:36:54.542
I see them a couple times a year.
They come whenever I‘m in a rodeo.

476
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.915
I'm a pretty good roper.

477
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:01.924
I get lonesome. Sure.

478
00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:06.262
My daughter‘s almost your size.

479
00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:09.140
You a size 12?

480
00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:13.970
So is she.
I bought her a dress for Christmas, size 12.

481
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:21.103
What happened?
Did you just stop loving your wife, Gay?

482
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:27.317
I came home one night,
and she's all wrapped up with a fellow.

483
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.908
Turned out to be a friend,
a cousin of mine, actually.

484
00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.327
You never had any idea, huh?

485
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:38.336
No. You know,
I thought you got married and that was it.

486
00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:41.088
But nothing's it.

487
00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:43.132
Not forever.

488
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:48.175
That's what I can't get used to.
Everything keeps changing.

489
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.641
I'll tell you this, though,

490
00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:56.767
I wouldn‘t know how to say
good-bye to you, Roslyn.

491
00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.395
It surprises me.

492
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:08.525
There‘s a lot to be done around here
if we were going to stay.

493
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.362
Let‘s go out in the sunshine. Come on.

494
00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:21.546
Let‘s just live, like you said in the bar.

495
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:24.549
I don't know where I am yet.

496
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:29.003
Hey! Couldn‘t we use that for a step?

497
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.886
We just might at that.

498
00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:50.324
-There you are.
-Let me try it.

499
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:52.910
It's perfect. I can go in

500
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:55.322
and I can come out.

501
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.456
Go in

502
00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.742
and I can come out.

503
00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:02.165
Go in

504
00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:04.463
and I can come out.

505
00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:08.168
I can go in

506
00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:10.219
and I can come out.

507
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:11.155
Guido!

508
00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:15.865
-What‘s he doing?
-He might land. There’s a place back there.

509
00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:24.752
No. I guessjust saying hello.

510
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:28.255
-Here, have some lemonade.
-Oh, thanks.

511
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:31.876
What does he do, just fly around?

512
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:33.336
Could be going for eagles.

513
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:35.721
Sometimes the ranchers
hire him to shoot eagles.

514
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.089
Why?

515
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:39.258
They kill a lot of lambs.

516
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:41.511
He gets $50 a bird.

517
00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:45.810
I never really saw anything grow before.

518
00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:48.730
How tiny those seeds were

519
00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:51.104
yet they know
they‘re supposed to be Iettuces.

520
00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:55.699
You say the darnedest things.
You know that, don‘t you?

521
00:40:56.788 --> 00:41:00.372
Everybody‘s busy in Chicago,
and here we are.

522
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.037
I love this whole state.

523
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:09.919
Hey! What have we here, now?

524
00:41:12.804 --> 00:41:15.216
Just plain old rabbit.

525
00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:18.214
I‘m going to get him.

526
00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:21.718
Just one lettuce.
Maybe he won't do it anymore.

527
00:41:21.938 --> 00:41:25.351
Once they‘ve zeroed in on that garden,
it's them or us.

528
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:29.146
-There won‘t be a thing left in a week.
-Couldn’t you wait and see?

529
00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:31.318
I can't stand to see anything killed.

530
00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:33.146
Honey, it‘s only a rabbit.

531
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.740
But it doesn‘t know any better.

532
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.242
Go inside. I'II handle this.

533
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:39.694
You worked hard, but...

534
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:42.659
You're darn right,
I never worked like that for anybody

535
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.911
and it wasn‘t for some bug-eyed rabbit.

536
00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:46.243
Gay, please.

537
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.750
Will you go inside and stop being silly?

538
00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:51.922
I‘m not being silly.

539
00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:54.299
You don't respect what I feel.

540
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:56.502
I don’t care about the lettuce!

541
00:41:56.597 --> 00:42:00.260
I care about it.
How about having some respect for me?

542
00:42:01.978 --> 00:42:04.219
Oh, Guido and Isabelle!

543
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.554
Dear girl.

544
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:08.518
I thought I saw a passenger.

545
00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:10.816
How you been? We never heard you land.

546
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:14.529
Am I in the right place?

547
00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:18.608
Have you seen the vegetable garden?
It took a week to turn the soil.

548
00:42:18.745 --> 00:42:20.952
Mowed the grass
and put in the flowers, too.

549
00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.122
I got your windows unstuck.
The fireplace don't smoke anymore.

550
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.789
Roslyn, you‘re a magician.

551
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:29.369
The only thing he ever did for women
was get out ice cubes.

552
00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:33.039
-We have chairs. Come sit down.
-Let's go inside.

553
00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:36.794
I‘ve moved this furniture so much,
I‘m getting long ears.

554
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.296
My, you look lovely.

555
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:42.970
You've really found yourself, haven't you?

556
00:42:44.479 --> 00:42:47.437
It's so nice to see you.
Look, we have a step.

557
00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:50.974
-How‘s your arm?
-Still weak as a bird's wing.

558
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:56.567
I never saw anything like it in my life.
It’s magical.

559
00:42:56.783 --> 00:43:00.401
Just hope you realize you finally
made contact with a real woman.

560
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:02.743
My dear girl.

561
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:07.240
Guido, I want to show you the rest.
I changed a few things, though.

562
00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:12.624
We've changed things around,

563
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.336
and how do you like it?

564
00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:20.841
Don‘t look at those.
They‘re nothing. Gay hung them for a joke.

565
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:23.764
I put your picture up in the living room.

566
00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:28.599
Come on. Let's have lots of drinks.
Come on.

567
00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:34.854
It's so nice to have company.

568
00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:43.026
I put your picture over there.
Is that all right?

569
00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.070
You don‘t have to keep it out, Roslyn.

570
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:47.371
Why? It's part of the house.

571
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:51.622
Besides, it's your house.
Don't sit there. Sit in the big chair.

572
00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:55.000
-This must've been your chair.
-Matter of fact, it was.

573
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.881
Isabelle, put this under your arm.

574
00:43:58.094 --> 00:43:59.800
Thanks, dear girl.

575
00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:04.965
I did all my studying in this chair,
when I was still ambitious.

576
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:06.966
What did you study?

577
00:44:07.228 --> 00:44:09.935
I wanted to be a doctor before the war.

578
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.934
Who knows?
Maybe you‘ll get ambitious again.

579
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:17.230
I‘m going to tell you something, Roslyn.

580
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:19.277
I spent four years in the war.

581
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.197
Did two tours, flew 50 missions.

582
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:26.861
Every time I came back to base,
I started designing this house

583
00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:30.749
but it never looked like my idea of it.

584
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.041
Now it almost does.

585
00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:36.792
You walk in, a stranger out of nowhere,

586
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:39.711
and, for the first time, it all lights up.

587
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.552
And I'm sure you know why, too.

588
00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:45.714
Why?

589
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.257
Because you have the gift for life, Roslyn.

590
00:44:48.728 --> 00:44:53.563
The rest of us, we're just looking
for a place to hide and watch it go by.

591
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:54.771
Amen.

592
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:58.605
Here's to your life, Roslyn.

593
00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:00.770
I hope it goes on forever.

594
00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:02.279
And yours.

595
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:04.106
And yours, Isabelle.

596
00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:06.025
And Gay.

597
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.110
Gay did all the work, you know.

598
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:11.076
Yeah, and the rabbits are sure enjoying it.

599
00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:16.954
Could you break away from this paradise
long enough to do some mustanging?

600
00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:21.165
Mustanging?
Now you’re saying something.

601
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.625
You been in the mountains?

602
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:26.004
Took a look this morning.
I spotted 15 horses.

603
00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:29.302
That's not too bad.

604
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:33.974
Boy, I'd sure like to get my hands
on a rope again.

605
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:36.138
What do you say?

606
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:40.773
I will never understand cowboys.
All crazy about animals.

607
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:45.235
The minute they got nothing to do,
they go bother those poor wild horses.

608
00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:47.236
Shame on you.

609
00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:49.611
Horses?

610
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:52.409
Oh, sure, honey. Nevada mustang.

611
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:56.330
They used to ship them all over
the United States. Not many left.

612
00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:58.536
We'd need another man.

613
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:01.964
The Dayton rodeo's on today.
We‘ll get one there.

614
00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:05.672
That's an idea. You never saw a rodeo.

615
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.296
You got to see one.

616
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:10.177
I‘d love to. Will you come?

617
00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:11.841
I'm all set.

618
00:46:12.228 --> 00:46:14.435
I‘ll get dressed up. Let's have some fun.

619
00:46:14.522 --> 00:46:16.183
That's a girl. Get going, now.

620
00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:20.233
Honey, when you smile,
it's like the sun coming up.

621
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:31.494
I'd like to stop and get cleaned up.

622
00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:34.201
Why? You look nice. Doesn't he?

623
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.665
Lots better than some I‘ve known.

624
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.877
You're just a mass of compliments.

625
00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:42.709
Hey, Gay. Stop.

626
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.041
That guy next to the phone booth.

627
00:46:45.094 --> 00:46:47.551
You worked the Stinson rodeo
with him last year.

628
00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:50.303
-Perce Howland?
-Gay Langland.

629
00:46:51.017 --> 00:46:52.678
You old buzzard, you.

630
00:46:52.727 --> 00:46:54.843
What are you doing here?

631
00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:58.057
I hitched me a ride to the Dayton rodeo

632
00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:01.687
but this fellow changed his mind
and left me sitting here.

633
00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:03.901
Roslyn, this is Perce Howland.

634
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.443
Gay‘s coming up in the world.
How do, Ma'am?

635
00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:09.239
This is Isabelle.

636
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.112
I got a call in for home,
but they keep putting me in to Wyoming.

637
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.706
Hello?

638
00:47:18.878 --> 00:47:21.460
Hello, Ma. This is Perce.

639
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.126
Yeah, I'm okay.

640
00:47:24.759 --> 00:47:27.717
No, I was in Colorado. I'm in Nevada now.

641
00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:29.960
Just won me a bull ride.

642
00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:32.254
Yeah.

643
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:36.008
Yeah, a pretty good rodeo.

644
00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:38.264
$100.

645
00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:44.646
Ma, I was going to buy you
a birthday present with it

646
00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:47.527
but I was coming out of my boots.

647
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.067
No, Ma, I haven't been
in the hospital since we talked.

648
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.075
I just bought some boots.

649
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:59.791
Ma, why would I want to get married?
I just bought some boots.

650
00:48:01.921 --> 00:48:03.331
Hey, you know what?

651
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.503
On top of purse money,
I won me a nice silver buckle.

652
00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:12.174
Got a bucking horse on it and
my entire name written out underneath.

653
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.721
You proud?

654
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:20.144
Oh, no. My face is fine.
It's all healed. It‘s as good as new.

655
00:48:21.107 --> 00:48:22.893
You would, too, recognize me.

656
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.358
Okay, operator. Ma, listen.

657
00:48:26.695 --> 00:48:30.153
Say hello to Frieda for me, will you?
And to Victoria.

658
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.856
Yeah, and to Uncle George.

659
00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:37.323
Okay, say hello to him, too.

660
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:42.200
No, Ma. Itjust slipped my mind, that's all.

661
00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:45.461
Well, okay. I‘m saying it now.

662
00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:50.374
Ma, you married him, I didn‘t,
so say hello to him.

663
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.012
Oh, is that... Listen. Listen.

664
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:57.382
Maybe I'll call you Christmastime.

665
00:48:58.185 --> 00:48:59.265
Okay.

666
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.136
Hello? Hello.

667
00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:08.024
God bless you, too.

668
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:15.240
I just know you'll take me to that rodeo.

669
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:16.950
Sure. You entered?

670
00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:20.579
I aim to be, if I get a ride

671
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:24.580
and if I can raise $10 for the entrance fee.

672
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:27.123
I spent my last dollar on the phone.

673
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:29.706
I‘m real equipped, ain‘t I?

674
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:32.170
How‘d you like to do some mustanging?

675
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.710
We were going to find a third man.

676
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:37.387
You still flying that DC-6
and seven-eighths?

677
00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:39.389
It's safer than bucking horses.

678
00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:42.013
I didn't know there were mustangs.

679
00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:44.018
I spotted 15 this morning.

680
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:46.020
There might be more.

681
00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.230
What do you expect
to get out of 15 horses?

682
00:49:51.614 --> 00:49:53.980
If there was a thousand or more...

683
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:57.487
But going all the way up there for 15
kind of hits me sideways.

684
00:49:57.912 --> 00:49:59.402
Better than wages.

685
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:01.829
Anything‘s better than wages.

686
00:50:02.875 --> 00:50:05.457
We'll drive you to the rodeo, put up the $10.

687
00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:08.581
Tomorrow morning,
you help us run some mustangs.

688
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:10.420
All right.

689
00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:13.708
You get me a good bottle of whiskey
to keep me primed for the rodeo.

690
00:50:14.553 --> 00:50:16.418
Just wait right here.

691
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.136
You an old friend of Gay's?

692
00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:29.056
Pretty old.

693
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:35.438
I broke my arm three times
in the same place.

694
00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.690
You don't do that faking a fall.

695
00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:40.279
You know what some riders do?

696
00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:43.913
They drop off and lay like they were dead.

697
00:50:43.958 --> 00:50:46.825
Not me. I don't fake nothing.

698
00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:51.124
-Right, Gay?
-That‘s right, you're a natural-born fool.

699
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.840
It's wonderful to be that way.
I know what you mean.

700
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:58.465
I used to dance in places,
and everybody thought I was crazy.

701
00:50:58.514 --> 00:51:00.050
I really tried.

702
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:04.471
-People don't know the difference.
-She'd try. I can just see her trying.

703
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.852
What kind of dancing did you do?

704
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:10.602
Interpretive dancing.
Nightclubs and... That's all.

705
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:15.774
I was in a nightclub in Kansas City
called the Naked Truth

706
00:51:16.782 --> 00:51:18.864
and they wasn‘t kidding.

707
00:51:20.411 --> 00:51:22.151
Dayton, coming up.

708
00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:28.165
Hey, Joe.

709
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:37.333
Hey, Bengie.

710
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.669
Hi, you old heathen, you.

711
00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:43.305
Gimme.

712
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:45.511
Hiya, Perce.

713
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:48.303
There‘s Franklin.
Boy, does he hate his wife.

714
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:50.641
Hey, Franklin. How's the wife?

715
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:56.940
Man, there are a lot of good men here.

716
00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:58.984
I hope I draw a good horse.

717
00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:02.821
Just come out in one piece.
You got to go mustanging tomorrow.

718
00:52:27.645 --> 00:52:29.556
Church Ladies‘ Auxiliary.

719
00:52:29.605 --> 00:52:30.594
Sure.

720
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:33.897
-How about you, sinner?
-I ain‘t got no money yet.

721
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.817
Church Ladies‘ Auxiliary.

722
00:52:49.625 --> 00:52:53.538
-You got me at the bar next door.
-That'll learn you to stay put.

723
00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:55.745
Church Ladies‘ Auxiliary.

724
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.261
Grandson, I'll buy you a drink.

725
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.925
Excuse me.

726
00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.935
There ain‘t many of us left now.

727
00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.263
Things are tough all over, pop.

728
00:53:16.694 --> 00:53:19.686
Give me a great big glass of soda pop

729
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.395
for my grandson, Lester.

730
00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:25.612
I got to hold on to him tight,
othen/vise he'll run off to school.

731
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:29.194
Hey, let me show you this.

732
00:53:29.623 --> 00:53:33.286
This is the gol‘ darnedest contraption
that anybody's ever seen.

733
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:35.997
You got to hit the ball.

734
00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:39.964
-You catch what I mean?
-I can do it. Let me try.

735
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.292
I'll bet $2 you can‘t hit it 10 times.

736
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:45.468
I'll take that bet.

737
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:48.805
I can do 10, I think.

738
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.382
Here's the paddle.

739
00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.642
Gangway!

740
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:53.973
We've got a bet on.

741
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:56.062
3, 4, 5, 6,

742
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.640
7, 8, 9, 10,

743
00:53:57.693 --> 00:53:59.979
11,12,13,14,15,16,

744
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.776
17, 18, 19, 20,

745
00:54:01.864 --> 00:54:03.479
21, 22, 23, 24,

746
00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:04.692
25, 26, 27,

747
00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:05.989
28, 29, 30.

748
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:18.502
$5.

749
00:54:18.547 --> 00:54:19.832
$6.

750
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.052
The bet's $5.

751
00:54:58.045 --> 00:55:01.378
Help the good work, boy.
Do it while the spirit's in you.

752
00:55:06.094 --> 00:55:07.129
70.

753
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.318
-What's the trouble?
-He put his hand on her.

754
00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:26.736
-That right, fella?
-I didn't mean nothing.

755
00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:29.649
What's going on?
Are you looking for a fight?

756
00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:33.073
-Let's look for the rodeo.
-Okay. Here, for the kid.

757
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.155
Isabelle, come on.

758
00:55:46.134 --> 00:55:49.251
Lester, where'd you get the money?

759
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:57.555
Hey, $100... $145.

760
00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:00.433
Hello, gold mine.

761
00:56:00.482 --> 00:56:01.972
That girl can do anything.

762
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:03.603
I‘d marry you.

763
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:07.649
Thanks for saying it,
but you don‘t have to do that.

764
00:56:14.413 --> 00:56:15.448
Charles!

765
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.201
You've got it in your eyes.

766
00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:21.454
You're looking for the light, sinner.

767
00:56:21.587 --> 00:56:24.499
I know you and love you
for your life of pain and sin.

768
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:28.670
Give it to the one who understands,
the only one who loves you.

769
00:56:28.844 --> 00:56:31.301
-She ain't sinned that much.
-Lord be praised!

770
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:33.591
We're buying a fence around the graveyard.

771
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.928
Keep these cowboys
from pasturing their horses there.

772
00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:40.978
Sweetheart, you‘ve gone
and helped our dead to rest in peace.

773
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:45.729
Who do you think is here?

774
00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:48.648
-Who do you think is here?
-Who?

775
00:56:48.822 --> 00:56:50.312
My husband.

776
00:56:52.492 --> 00:56:54.699
I‘m so happy!

777
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:56.659
I never was so surprised.

778
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.991
They‘re here on their vacation.

779
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:03.333
-His wife?
-Clara. You‘ve heard me speak of her.

780
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.833
She‘s my oldest friend.
She's sweeter than ever.

781
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:09.294
She must be, if you're glad to see her.

782
00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.504
Charles never would've stayed
married to me.

783
00:57:11.637 --> 00:57:13.673
I lost the vacuum cleaner once.

784
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.013
They still haven't found it.

785
00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:18.006
We gotta get this boy on a horse.

786
00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:20.885
I'll be around, but I can't go mustanging.

787
00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:23.686
They're staying at my house for a week.

788
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.522
Good luck, boys.

789
00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:43.331
Jim Palem in the saddle,
now ready to go on Polka Dot, Gate 1.

790
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:57.462
I didn't know it was dangerous.

791
00:57:57.557 --> 00:57:59.548
That‘s how they want it.

792
00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:05.930
That strap makes them buck,
grabs them where they don't like it.

793
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.685
That‘s not fair.

794
00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:10.066
You wouldn't have a rodeo otherwise.

795
00:58:10.946 --> 00:58:13.062
Then they shouldn't have a rodeo.

796
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.359
What are you trying to do?

797
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.368
Come on, Les.

798
00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:29.578
Don't break it, Grandpa.

799
00:58:29.715 --> 00:58:32.422
Don't get mad about it. Come on, Lester.

800
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.055
I hope you‘re sober.

801
00:58:41.601 --> 00:58:44.934
I've won money in towns
I couldn't remember the name of.

802
00:58:45.439 --> 00:58:46.849
There she is.

803
00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:50.936
I mean, there they are.

804
00:58:54.573 --> 00:58:57.030
I wouldn't want to move in on you.

805
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.608
Unless you wouldn't mind.

806
00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:01.360
Boy, I'd mind.

807
00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:12.871
The next rider is Perce How/and
of White River, Wyoming.

808
00:59:12.966 --> 00:59:16.800
-Ca|ifornia, not Wyoming!
-You ready, boy? Open the gate!

809
00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:23.298
Come on, Perce!

810
00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.354
Perce!

811
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.408
-Thanks, Jim.
-It‘s okay.

812
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:54.003
-Where's my hat, Pa?
-You got it on.

813
00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:57.208
-You‘re bleeding!
-Frieda, I'm all right.

814
00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:59.634
Boy, she ain‘t your sister.

815
01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.635
You've been messing with
the wrong end of the horse.

816
01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:05.348
Are you a doctor?

817
01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.384
I don't want a doctor.

818
01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.720
I'm no doctor. I'll clean you up.

819
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:13.189
-Isn't there a doctor?
-Not for 60 miles. He ain’t badly hurt.

820
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.359
How do you know? Come with me.

821
01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.062
Don't start running things here.

822
01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.899
I don't understand, he‘s your friend...

823
01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.071
You're all right, ain‘t you?

824
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.452
Are you all right?

825
01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:30.283
-Did I make the whistle?
-Almost. You done good, though.

826
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:34.161
That old horse,
he sure was rank, wasn't he?

827
01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.542
He was a real killer. You done good.

828
01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:38.707
Leave him alone.

829
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.797
The next event is the Brahma bull riding.

830
01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.096
No. You‘ve a couple minutes.

831
01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.223
-What for?
-He‘s got a bull to ride.

832
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.596
Come on, walk yourself around.

833
01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:54.056
-He's not going in there again?
-I guess he wants to ride that bull.

834
01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.434
Let him walk it off!

835
01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:00.862
Why are you doing it?
Take the money we won in the bar.

836
01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.114
You helped me win it. Take it.

837
01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.325
It's over $100.
You don‘t have to go back in there.

838
01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:09.871
I‘m pretty good at riding bulls. Watch me.

839
01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.658
-But why are you doing it?
-I put in for it.

840
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.079
I entered.

841
01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:16.370
-Stop him!
-How can I?

842
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.955
They don‘t mind getting busted up.

843
01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.763
-You don't know what you're saying!
-Here's your prize!

844
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.806
Okay, boy, you want it?

845
01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:29.970
Hell, yes.

846
01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.306
There are real men in the West.

847
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.938
Back again, this time on a Brahma bull,

848
01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:38.692
the cowboy from Black Hills, Colorado,
Perce How/and!

849
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.803
Come on, honey.
We’re going to have some drinks.

850
01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.181
Is he unconscious still?

851
01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.978
It ain’t noticeable.

852
01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:23.191
He‘s arguing with the judge
about who won.

853
01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.238
Are you still mad at me?

854
01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.407
I don't understand.

855
01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.325
People dying
and people just standing around.

856
01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:33.655
Don't you care?

857
01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.324
I went in for that boy
with a bull running loose.

858
01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.161
I‘m lucky to be here. Don‘t you know that?

859
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.247
You did?

860
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.465
I thought I could get him out, so I did.

861
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.469
But what if he died? It would be terrible.

862
01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:51.094
We got to go sometime.
Reason or no reason.

863
01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.764
Dying‘s as natural as living.
A man afraid to die is afraid to live.

864
01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.516
Roz, did you see me?

865
01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.849
You were wonderful.
Let‘s go to the hospital.

866
01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.859
We're going to have some fun.

867
01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.021
How do you feel?

868
01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:09.066
How do I feel? Like I was kicked by a bull.

869
01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.360
He was something.

870
01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:14.867
I want no part of him,
except on a plate, medium rare.

871
01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:18.574
Is he all right?

872
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.629
Sure. In two weeks,
he won’t remember this, or you, either.

873
01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.332
Give your sympathy where it‘s appreciated.

874
01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.216
Where's that?

875
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.680
You guys, come on!

876
01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.934
Boy, do I feel funny.

877
01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.728
I feel like...

878
01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.644
What was in the injection
that man gave me?

879
01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:46.269
I see the prettiest stars.
I‘ve never seen stars before.

880
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.355
You ever see stars before, Gay?

881
01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:52.067
It's like that bull
had the Milky Way in his hoof.

882
01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.489
Whiskey for eight people, huh?

883
01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.374
Was that you, crying in the ambulance?

884
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.963
Was that her, Gay?

885
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:07.502
It sure was.

886
01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.294
I certainly want to thank you.

887
01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.555
Here's to my buddy, old, elderly Gay.

888
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.386
Gay's not old.

889
01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:24.771
And to old, elderly Pilot
and his $5, elderly airplane.

890
01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.613
And to my friend Roslyn.

891
01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:34.776
We're all buddies now, right?

892
01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:36.703
That‘s right.

893
01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.034
What are you looking mad at me for?

894
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.796
Is it all right
if we have this dance together?

895
01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.173
Sure.

896
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.177
Roslyn, why don‘t you dance with Perce?

897
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.346
Okay.

898
01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.778
Nothing like being young, is there, Gay?

899
01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.662
That‘s right.

900
01:05:22.627 --> 01:05:24.538
But you know what they say.

901
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:28.747
There's some keeps
getting younger all the time.

902
01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.048
What's eating you?

903
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.846
Just my life.

904
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.187
This is the way my father used to do it.

905
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:04.408
-What‘s the matter?
-lt's all right.

906
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.036
Come on, let‘s go out and see the world.

907
01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.469
Are you okay?

908
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.857
I better sit down.

909
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:40.402
-You mind?
-No.

910
01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.325
Damn that bull.

911
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.991
Don't say anything. Just be still.

912
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.253
Gay's a pretty great fella, isn't he?

913
01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.455
Yes.

914
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.967
I can't figure you floating around out here.

915
01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.092
You belong to Gay?

916
01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:03.466
I don't know where I belong.

917
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:08.647
I don't like to see the way
they grind up women out here.

918
01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.442
I guess a lot of them don't mind, do they?

919
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.111
Some do.

920
01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.532
Don't you let them grind you up, hear?

921
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.953
How come you got such trust in your eyes?

922
01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.705
-I do?
-Like you was just born.

923
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.326
Was you really crying for me before?

924
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.917
You were hurt.

925
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.541
Didn't anyone ever cry for you before?

926
01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.169
No stranger.

927
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.931
Last April 12,

928
01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.807
I was kicked so bad
I was out all day and all night

929
01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.982
and I was with my girlfriend
and my two buddies.

930
01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.406
They left you?

931
01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.067
Alone?

932
01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:06.329
Can I ask you something?

933
01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:12.877
I don't have anybody,
you know what I mean,

934
01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.420
I could talk to.

935
01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.790
And I don't know how you should do.

936
01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:20.884
What do you mean?

937
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.642
See, this is the first year
that I've been floating around.

938
01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.598
I‘m not like Gay and Pilot.

939
01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.888
I got a pretty good home.

940
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:36.022
I had a good home.

941
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.352
One day,

942
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:42.987
my father, we was out back, and,

943
01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:47.032
boom, like that, it happened.
Down he went.

944
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.866
Some damn fool hunters.

945
01:08:52.378 --> 01:08:53.993
They killed him?

946
01:08:56.507 --> 01:08:58.213
And then she changed.

947
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:00.883
Who was she?

948
01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.297
My mother.

949
01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.387
She used to be so dignified.

950
01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:10.719
She'd walk next to him like a saint.

951
01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.643
Pretty soon,
this man starts coming around.

952
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.855
She changed.

953
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:24.899
Three months, they got married.

954
01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.156
Okay.

955
01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:30.905
But I said to her, "Ma, look,

956
01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.917
"you get a paper from this Mr. Blackwell

957
01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:38.914
"because I'm the oldest, and you know
Papa wanted me to have this ranch.“

958
01:09:39.967 --> 01:09:41.377
You know what happened?

959
01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.085
On their wedding night,

960
01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.970
he turns around and offers me wages

961
01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.099
on my father's place.

962
01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.305
What did she say?

963
01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.263
She said...

964
01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.934
I don’t think she heard.

965
01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:04.272
It's like she hardly
remembers me anymore.

966
01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:06.941
I don't know.

967
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:11.325
It's hard to explain.
It's like she's changed altogether.

968
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.794
What I want to know is

969
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.505
who do you depend on? Who?

970
01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:23.841
I don't know.

971
01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:29.593
Maybe all there really is
is just the next thing.

972
01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.970
The next thing that happens.

973
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:36.638
Maybe you‘re not supposed to
remember anybody's promises.

974
01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.223
You could count on mine.

975
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.479
I trust you, Roslyn.

976
01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.272
I think I love you.

977
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.270
Oh, you don't know me.

978
01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.568
I don't care.

979
01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.325
That damn bull!

980
01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.662
Here we are.

981
01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:03.206
Come on, now. I want you to meet my kids.

982
01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.130
Your kids are here?

983
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.512
Yeah. They came to the rodeo.

984
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.550
I ain‘t seen them in a year.

985
01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:17.557
The welcome they gave me
nearly knocked me over.

986
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:19.639
Isn‘t that great?

987
01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.354
I‘m so glad for you, Gay.

988
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:27.022
She's going to be 19.

989
01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:29.858
She got so pretty.

990
01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.160
They just happened to be here
for the rodeo.

991
01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.655
Both of them. That great?

992
01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.827
Where are they?

993
01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.043
Where are who?

994
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.792
My kids. I told them I'd be back in a minute.

995
01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:50.754
-You heard me tell them.
-They went outside.

996
01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.215
Outside.

997
01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:16.409
Gaylord, here's your father!

998
01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:19.870
Gaylord, I know you hear me!

999
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:24.458
Where you gone to?
I told you I‘d be right back!

1000
01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.463
You come here, now!

1001
01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.008
Don‘t worry, mister.
Probably find them at home.

1002
01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:32.804
Gaylord, you come here, now!

1003
01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.093
I know you hear me!

1004
01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:38.639
Rose-May, I know you hear me!

1005
01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.890
You come here, now.

1006
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.430
Oh, come on!

1007
01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.902
They're looking for you, I'm sure.
They probably thought you left them.

1008
01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.654
Poor Gay.

1009
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.616
Aren't you going too fast? Please.

1010
01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:09.378
Don't worry, kid.
I never kill anybody I know.

1011
01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:15.137
A fellow smashed up my best girlfriend.
She was beautiful, with black hair.

1012
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.131
Please, Guido.

1013
01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.977
Say hello to me, Roslyn.

1014
01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.809
Hello, Guido. Please, huh?

1015
01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:28.188
We were all blind bombardiers.

1016
01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.149
We killed people we never even saw.

1017
01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:33.315
I bombed nine cities.

1018
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:37.989
I sure must have broken a lot of dishes,
but I never saw them.

1019
01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.530
You think of all the puppy dogs

1020
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:45.327
and mail carriers and eyeglasses
must have gone up.

1021
01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:49.831
Boy, you know,
dropping a bomb is like telling a lie.

1022
01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:52.959
It makes everything so quiet.

1023
01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:56.797
Soon, you don't hear anything,
you don’t see anything,

1024
01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:58.847
not even your wife.

1025
01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:04.388
The difference is, I see you.
You're the first one I ever really saw.

1026
01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.764
Please, Guido, don't kill us.

1027
01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.189
How do you get to know somebody, kid?

1028
01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:16.111
I can't make a landing,
and I can‘t get up to God, either.

1029
01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.534
Help me.

1030
01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.989
I never said "help me“ in my life.

1031
01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.826
I don't know anybody,

1032
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.587
so how do I land, honey?

1033
01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:33.041
Will you give me a little time? Say yes.

1034
01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:39.714
At least say, "Hello, Guido.“

1035
01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:41.473
Yes, Guido.

1036
01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.433
Hello, Guido.

1037
01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.016
Hello, Roslyn.

1038
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.506
I'll drive.

1039
01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:40.172
Gay, we‘re here.

1040
01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.502
Where?

1041
01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.523
Guido, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:01.735
Guido, I'm sorry.

1043
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.323
Won‘t you hurt your hand? It's so dark.

1044
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.489
Guido, look how dark it is. It's all dark.

1045
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.419
What in hell are you stomping
in the flowers for?

1046
01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:18.957
You busted all the damn heliotropes.

1047
01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.918
Look at that.

1048
01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.761
What in the hell good is that?

1049
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.888
He‘s just fixing the house.

1050
01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.888
What call has he got to fix the house?

1051
01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.228
He‘s only trying to say hello.

1052
01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:34.563
Hello.

1053
01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.815
Who‘s doing that?

1054
01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:39.853
Who‘s done this?

1055
01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:41.774
Who‘s done this?

1056
01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:44.073
Don't take it off!

1057
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.408
Take it off me! What is it?

1058
01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:48.243
Don't take it off!

1059
01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:51.539
-What is it?
-It‘s your bandage. Stop tangling it.

1060
01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:55.410
-Bandage? What for?
-For your head.

1061
01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.007
Who tied this on me?

1062
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:05.757
-Don‘t take it off!
-You leave me at a disadvantage all night?

1063
01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:06.921
No!

1064
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.635
Was it you, Gay?

1065
01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.143
Was it you, Gay?

1066
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.226
Who did that?

1067
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.770
You leave me at a disadvantage?

1068
01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:23.983
Yeah.

1069
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.615
Now, wait a minute here.

1070
01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.989
Where are we? Where are you going?

1071
01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.490
Leave me alone.

1072
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.657
What's wrong? Where are we going?

1073
01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.250
What is this? Watch it.

1074
01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.620
What is this place? Where are we?

1075
01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:44.505
This is my house, or it‘s Guido‘s.
It’s a house, anyway.

1076
01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:03.481
No. Ma, don‘t.

1077
01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:18.872
Come on, Gay.

1078
01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:23.338
I wish you'd met Gaylord or Rose-May.

1079
01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:30.213
If I had a new kid,
I'd knowjust how to be with him,

1080
01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.594
just how to do it.

1081
01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.260
I wasted those kids.

1082
01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:38.557
I didn't know nothing.

1083
01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:42.187
No. I'm sure they love you, Gay.

1084
01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:47.230
Would you ever want a kid with me?

1085
01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.029
I‘ll turn off the light in the car.
You get some sleep.

1086
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.157
I don‘t want to sleep.
I asked you a question.

1087
01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:57.365
Did I ask you
to turn the lights out in the car?

1088
01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:01.707
What are you running away from
all the time?

1089
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.876
I wouldn‘t wash the windows for my wife.

1090
01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:08.884
Painted a fireplace,
planted them damn heliotropes.

1091
01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.720
What are they doing here?

1092
01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:15.883
What do you keep
bringing them around for?

1093
01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:18.803
-Gay, I didn't bring them here.
-Where are you at?

1094
01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.183
I don't know where you‘re at.

1095
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.397
Gay, I'm with you. I'm here with you.

1096
01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.700
Gay, what if someday,
suddenly, you turn around

1097
01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.952
and you don't like me anymore?

1098
01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:39.741
Like before, when Perce got hurt,
you started to give me a look.

1099
01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.043
I know that look, and it scares me, Gay.

1100
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:46.167
I couldn‘t be with strangers anymore.

1101
01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:50.926
Honey, I got a little mad, that's all.

1102
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.842
That don‘t mean I didn‘t like you.

1103
01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.304
Didn't your papa ever spank you

1104
01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.269
and then pick you up
and give you a big kiss?

1105
01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.187
He did, didn't he?

1106
01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.523
He was never there long enough.

1107
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.852
Strangers spanked me for keeps.

1108
01:21:07.988 --> 01:21:10.400
Gay, love me!

1109
01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.291
We made up now, okay?

1110
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.622
Yeah, okay.

1111
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.008
Let‘s get some sleep.

1112
01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:37.256
Yeah. We‘ll make out.

1113
01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:41.185
I‘ll farm, run some cattle maybe.

1114
01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.688
I‘m a pretty good man, Roslyn.

1115
01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:46.849
Best man you'll ever see.

1116
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:50.106
I‘ll show you tomorrow,
up in the mountains.

1117
01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:52.904
Not many can keep up with old Gay.

1118
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:55.607
You wait and see.

1119
01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:10.589
Help.

1120
01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.008
Why is the dog shivering?

1121
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.017
He‘ll do that up here.

1122
01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:44.706
And then the Milky Way
goes up there across that.

1123
01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:48.369
That star...

1124
01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.288
That star is so far away

1125
01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:55.425
that by the time
the light from it reaches Earth

1126
01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:59.300
it might not even be up there anymore.

1127
01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:01.632
You sure know a lot, don't you, Pilot?

1128
01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:05.886
Astronomy‘s in library books, Perce.
Nothing to it but reading.

1129
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.601
It's wonderful to know things.

1130
01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:10.974
Knowing things don't matter much.

1131
01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.559
You got something more important.

1132
01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:14.478
What?

1133
01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:15.562
You care.

1134
01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:20.075
Whatever happens to anybody,
it happens to you.

1135
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:24.242
You're really hooked into the whole thing.
It's a blessing.

1136
01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.119
People say I'm just nervous.

1137
01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:31.086
Without the nervous people in the world,
we'd be eating each other.

1138
01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:35.754
I don‘t know about
you educated people, but

1139
01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.420
us ignorant folk got to hit the sack.

1140
01:23:46.897 --> 01:23:48.558
Why is the dog trembling?

1141
01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:52.771
Got a whiff of those horses, I guess.
Must be close by, Guido.

1142
01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:59.322
-Quiet, you fool!
-Don't, Gay. He couldn't help it.

1143
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.571
Have the horses ever kicked him?

1144
01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:04.862
It's not the horses he‘s afraid of. It's us.

1145
01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.370
What are you talking about?
I never mistreated that dog.

1146
01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.827
It's only common sense, Gay.

1147
01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.330
He knows there‘s wild animals up there.

1148
01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:17.461
Dogs were wild, too, once.
He‘s just remembering when.

1149
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.631
He‘s been here enough to know
what will happen.

1150
01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:23.509
He‘s scared he'll end up dead.

1151
01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:28.473
Come on, honey.

1152
01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.808
Keep yourself nice and warm by the fire.

1153
01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.188
You kill them?

1154
01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:41.273
No. We sell them to the dealer.

1155
01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.316
He kills them?

1156
01:24:46.456 --> 01:24:49.573
They're what they call chicken-feed horses.
Turn them into dog food.

1157
01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.452
Like you buy in the store
for the dog and cat.

1158
01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.167
I thought you knew that.

1159
01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.958
Everybody knows that.

1160
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:07.683
Maybe you better sleep on the truck
in case something comes crawling around.

1161
01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:31.706
Get some sleep, now. Come on.

1162
01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:33.996
Honey.

1163
01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:49.683
Honey, I just round them up
and sell them to the dealer.

1164
01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:57.141
There's no need to look at me that way.
You're looking at me like I was a stranger.

1165
01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.437
Honey.

1166
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.736
I thought they were used for riding or...

1167
01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:04.065
Sure. They used to be.

1168
01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:07.568
Christmas presents for kids
because they‘re small.

1169
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.494
Kids loved them,

1170
01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:12.619
but kids ride motor scooters now.

1171
01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:18.416
They're real strong horses, though,
little as they are.

1172
01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.047
They used to breed to them for stamina.

1173
01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:23.459
Mustang blood pulled
all the plows in the West.

1174
01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:27.671
They couldn‘t have settled unless
somebody caught mustang for them.

1175
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.716
Somehow it all got changed around.

1176
01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.434
I‘m doing the same thing I always did.

1177
01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:36.229
It's just that they changed it around.

1178
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.608
You know what you're doing isn't right,
don't you?

1179
01:26:39.653 --> 01:26:43.191
-You know that.
-If I didn‘t do it, somebody else would.

1180
01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:46.615
-I don't care about the others.
-You bought food for my dog.

1181
01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:49.318
-What‘d you think was in it?
-I don't want to hear.

1182
01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:51.654
Nothing can live unless something dies.

1183
01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.530
Stop.

1184
01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:57.576
We never kidded, you and I.

1185
01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.120
I don't want to lose you.

1186
01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:05.134
You have to help me, because I can't
put on that this is as bad as you make it.

1187
01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:08.295
All I know is, everything else is wages.

1188
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:11.974
I hunt these horses to keep myself free,
so I'm a free man.

1189
01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:14.684
That's why you liked me, isn‘t it?

1190
01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:19.394
-I liked you because you were kind.
-I haven't changed.

1191
01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.475
Yes, this changes it.

1192
01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.860
Honey, a kind man can kill.

1193
01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.404
No, he can't.

1194
01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:31.656
Maybe you have to take
a little of the bad with the good

1195
01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:34.989
or else you'll be running
for the rest of your life.

1196
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:39.084
What is there to stop for?
You're just like everybody else.

1197
01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:44.297
Yeah, sure.
Maybe we're all alike, including you.

1198
01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.464
We start doing something,
meaning no harm,

1199
01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:51.092
something that's naturally in us to do,

1200
01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:55.176
but somewhere
it gets changed into something bad

1201
01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.894
like dancing in a nightclub.

1202
01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.518
You started out wanting to dance,
didn't you?

1203
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:05.360
Little by little, it turns out that people
ain't interested in how good you dance.

1204
01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:09.152
They‘re gawking at you
with something different in their minds.

1205
01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:11.528
They turn it sour, don‘t they?

1206
01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.661
I could've looked down my nose at you.

1207
01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:17.539
Showing yourself off in a nightclub.

1208
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.873
But I took my hat off to you,
because I know the difference.

1209
01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.672
This? This is how I dance, Roslyn.

1210
01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:31.720
If they make something else out of it,
I can’t run the world any more than you.

1211
01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:39.139
You took your hat off to me?

1212
01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.976
You mean that, don‘t you, Gay?

1213
01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:52.736
Good night.

1214
01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:17.765
Shame on you, you old fool.

1215
01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.106
I can fly her back in the morning,
it you want me to.

1216
01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.318
I was wondering
how she agreed to come here.

1217
01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.157
She‘s got a lot of right.

1218
01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:38.365
It don't make too much sense for 15 horses.

1219
01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:42.164
Don't worry. She‘s coming along fine.

1220
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.291
You be quiet, now.

1221
01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:52.964
Everybody‘s showing off.

1222
01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:28.002
Okay, Perce. Hold it!

1223
01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.211
Come on, Perce. Give me a hand here.

1224
01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:36.261
Look, Gay. He‘s not snapping anymore.

1225
01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:39.465
Things generally look different
in the morning.

1226
01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:54.946
Try and chase them down
the old mine road.

1227
01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.898
Okay, Gay. I‘m ready.

1228
01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.025
How do you want her?

1229
01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:01.494
That way.

1230
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.723
Boy, that's some jacket.
Pretty breezy though, isn't it?

1231
01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:27.720
Went on a lot of missions with it.

1232
01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:31.645
I wouldn‘t take $100 for it. It‘s bulletproof.

1233
01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:34.103
I wish you were coming.

1234
01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.400
You'd see some real flying.

1235
01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:40.575
Probably never see this again in history,
you know.

1236
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:45.906
Okay, Gay!

1237
01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:47.957
Switch off?

1238
01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:49.496
Throttle closed. Switch off.

1239
01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:55.623
Turn your partner, boy. Do-si-do.

1240
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.335
Once more, con amore!

1241
01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:01.087
Here we go!

1242
01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:02.506
Contact!

1243
01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:09.346
Lousy car gas. All right, try it again.

1244
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:11.639
Contact!

1245
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:35.809
It's like a dream.

1246
01:35:38.942 --> 01:35:40.648
I seen a picture of the moon once.

1247
01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.649
Looked just like this.

1248
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.191
-You want to come up?
-Yes.

1249
01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:51.109
He‘ll be driving the horses out of that pass.

1250
01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:54.241
-Who owns this land?
-Government, probably.

1251
01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:55.913
Just call it God‘s country.

1252
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:58.119
See anything?

1253
01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.542
How quiet it is.

1254
01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:04.498
You can hear your skin
against your clothes.

1255
01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.253
You're looking real good today.

1256
01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:09.006
What do you say we go dancing
in Reno tonight?

1257
01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:10.462
Okay.

1258
01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:13.381
I forgot to tell you something.

1259
01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:15.926
Cow outfits use the pasture
in those mountains.

1260
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.932
When they come across mustang,
they shoot them

1261
01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:21.230
because they eat all the good feed.

1262
01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.226
-You know that, don‘t you, Perce?
-Yeah, I know that.

1263
01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:26.944
-Why didn‘t you say so?
-I just did.

1264
01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:30.026
They're nothing but misfit horses.

1265
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:35.404
In the old days, they came out
of those passes 400, 500 at a time.

1266
01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:38.205
We'd funnel them into a corral.

1267
01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:41.409
Some were real beautiful animals.

1268
01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.707
Made sweet riding horses.

1269
01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:46.213
I wish I'd been here then.

1270
01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.625
-I hear something.
-What?

1271
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.210
Engine, sounds like.

1272
01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:51.385
Where?

1273
01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.587
Out there.

1274
01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:56.015
No, it‘s too soon.
He wouldn't be in the pass yet.

1275
01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:57.220
I hear him.

1276
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:58.510
There he is!

1277
01:36:58.604 --> 01:37:00.060
Gay, look!

1278
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.688
He never worked this fast before.
I didn‘t expect him so soon.

1279
01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:10.231
I saw him glinting against the sun.
It was the glint.

1280
01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:13.240
-What‘s that?
-He fired a shot.

1281
01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:14.992
You got good eyes.

1282
01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:18.495
Here they come.

1283
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.539
1,2,3,

1284
01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.909
4, 5, 6.

1285
01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.540
I guess he‘ll be going back for the rest.

1286
01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.462
Let me have a look.

1287
01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:32.878
-You see the rest yet?
-No. Six.

1288
01:37:34.223 --> 01:37:37.135
It looks like a stallion and four mares,

1289
01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:39.430
and a little colt.

1290
01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:40.927
You sure?

1291
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.971
Yeah. A spring foal.

1292
01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:48.935
It's a colt, all right, Gay.

1293
01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:50.941
Want a look?

1294
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:03.616
Maybe it‘s cooler in the truck.

1295
01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:10.794
It's all right. She's going to make it.

1296
01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:13.467
You said there'd be 15. There are only six.

1297
01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:16.212
Probably lost a few. That'II happen.

1298
01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:18.973
It don't make much sense for six, does it?

1299
01:38:19.018 --> 01:38:21.851
Six is six. Better than wages, ain't it?

1300
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.392
I said it's better than wages, ain't it?

1301
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.357
Sure, anything's better than wages.

1302
01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:34.606
I know a place about 100 miles northeast,
at Thighbone Mountain.

1303
01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.488
Must be at least 500 head in there.

1304
01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:41.784
I never bothered,
because it's tough to get them out.

1305
01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:43.573
You have to horseback into them.

1306
01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:45.329
I don't know, Gay.

1307
01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.628
Truth is,
I don't even know about rodeos anymore.

1308
01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:52.336
I'm beginning to smell wages all over you.

1309
01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:55.510
Sure wish my old man hadn't died.

1310
01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:59.013
When you get through wishing,
all there is, is a man's work

1311
01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:01.515
and there ain't much of that left.

1312
01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:03.551
Give me a hand.

1313
01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:28.952
Come on, Perce. Let's get these stakes in.

1314
01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:11.377
Come on, Dooley.

1315
01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:12.920
Come on, dog.

1316
01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:33.353
Come on, Perce!

1317
01:40:40.952 --> 01:40:42.488
Let's go, boy!

1318
01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:08.676
Grab hold, now.
We’ll be doing a lot of fast turning.

1319
01:41:32.545 --> 01:41:33.910
Throw again, Perce!

1320
01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:41.087
Get that horse, cowboy!

1321
01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:45.554
That‘s the way!

1322
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.360
Atta-boy, Gay!

1323
01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.723
Get that horse!

1324
01:43:03.761 --> 01:43:04.967
Atta-boy, Gay!

1325
01:43:10.685 --> 01:43:12.141
Here's the chief.

1326
01:43:12.561 --> 01:43:14.927
-What?
-The stallion.

1327
01:43:33.124 --> 01:43:34.739
Get that horse, cowboy!

1328
01:43:36.252 --> 01:43:37.458
That‘s the way!

1329
01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:47.339
We'll tie them up now

1330
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.218
and open their nooses
so they won't choke overnight.

1331
01:43:51.308 --> 01:43:52.639
Overnight?

1332
01:43:52.935 --> 01:43:56.143
The dealer‘s truck will pick them up
in the morning.

1333
01:44:16.167 --> 01:44:18.158
Were those his mares?

1334
01:44:18.377 --> 01:44:20.959
-I don't know.
-Was it his colt?

1335
01:44:25.384 --> 01:44:26.840
Get in here.

1336
01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:50.299
-Why are you killing him?
-Stand aside!

1337
01:45:50.427 --> 01:45:52.588
Okay, you've won!

1338
01:45:52.888 --> 01:45:55.846
Let go of that rope! Get out of here!

1339
01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.423
Gay, darling!

1340
01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:00.013
Choke him down, Guido!

1341
01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:02.220
-Get off me, Roslyn!
-Stop it!

1342
01:46:02.273 --> 01:46:03.763
Get away!

1343
01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:06.982
Shut up! Pull that horse down!

1344
01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:11.145
One, two, now!

1345
01:46:56.493 --> 01:46:59.485
Coming up here for the first time, like her,

1346
01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:03.910
there might not seem
much sense to it for only five horses.

1347
01:47:04.335 --> 01:47:05.825
Not knowing how it used to be.

1348
01:47:07.421 --> 01:47:12.006
I guess the fewer you kill,
the worse it looks.

1349
01:47:15.554 --> 01:47:17.340
What do you say we give her these horses?

1350
01:47:19.892 --> 01:47:21.553
How much do you want for them?

1351
01:47:21.644 --> 01:47:24.807
I'll give you $200, is that enough?

1352
01:47:34.073 --> 01:47:35.438
Let's get in the truck.

1353
01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:39.529
You just said you would give them to her.

1354
01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:42.077
I did think of it, but I sell to dealers only.

1355
01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:44.280
All they‘re looking to buy is a horse.

1356
01:47:44.375 --> 01:47:46.582
-I didn't mean to insult you.
-No insult.

1357
01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:50.123
But who do you think
you've been talking to since we met?

1358
01:48:18.075 --> 01:48:19.906
Brother, what a day.

1359
01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:22.943
I nearly hit a mountain back there.

1360
01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:25.700
The cylinder cut out
just at the bottom of a dive.

1361
01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:27.410
Squirting oil.

1362
01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:30.580
Boy, that's the closest I ever came.

1363
01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:36.419
Do you want me to stop this?

1364
01:48:37.636 --> 01:48:41.629
I know how you feel, Roslyn.
I never liked this part myself.

1365
01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:44.431
The only part I enjoyed is the flying.

1366
01:48:46.061 --> 01:48:48.222
Do you want me to stop it?

1367
01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:49.470
You would?

1368
01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:52.681
You're through with Gay now, right?

1369
01:48:54.069 --> 01:48:55.605
Tell me.

1370
01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:59.438
He doesn‘t know what you‘re all about.
He'll never know.

1371
01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:01.607
Tell me, Roslyn.

1372
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:05.619
I've been waiting.
I‘m going out of my mind with waiting.

1373
01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:10.624
Come back with me. Give me a week.
Let me show you what I am.

1374
01:49:12.254 --> 01:49:13.869
Tell me, Roslyn.

1375
01:49:14.715 --> 01:49:16.626
Give me a reason, and I'll stop it.

1376
01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:21.255
There'll be hell to pay,
but you give me a reason, and I'll do it.

1377
01:49:22.681 --> 01:49:27.471
You, a sensitive fellow, so sad for his wife,

1378
01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:31.303
crying to me about the bombs
you've dropped and the people you killed.

1379
01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.056
You have to get something to be human?

1380
01:49:34.151 --> 01:49:37.314
You never felt anything
for anybody in your life.

1381
01:49:37.905 --> 01:49:39.691
All you know is the sad words.

1382
01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:43.695
You could blow up the world
and feel sorry for yourself.

1383
01:50:15.359 --> 01:50:16.974
She‘s an old one.

1384
01:50:17.069 --> 01:50:20.903
Fifteen, if she's a day.
She wouldn't last through the winter.

1385
01:50:58.610 --> 01:51:01.101
We'll tie down the other three
on the way back.

1386
01:51:02.948 --> 01:51:04.984
How much does this mare weigh?

1387
01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:06.736
About 600 pounds.

1388
01:51:06.827 --> 01:51:09.864
There must be about 400 on that brown.

1389
01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:11.786
Just about. Yeah.

1390
01:51:11.874 --> 01:51:14.206
Must be about 800 on the stallion.

1391
01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:17.584
A little lighter. About 1,900, 2,000 pounds.

1392
01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.707
How does that come out?

1393
01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:23.248
Six cents a pound. About $110, $120.

1394
01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.583
How do you want to cut it up?

1395
01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:26.835
Any way you like.

1396
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:29.763
I'll take $50 for myself and the plane.

1397
01:51:30.267 --> 01:51:32.428
I ought to have about $40.

1398
01:51:33.896 --> 01:51:37.104
That leaves $25 for you, Perce.
Is that all right?

1399
01:51:39.234 --> 01:51:42.772
No, you take it.
I just came along for the ride, anyway.

1400
01:51:44.489 --> 01:51:45.820
Butchers!

1401
01:51:46.450 --> 01:51:49.157
Killers! Murderers!

1402
01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:51.156
You're liars!

1403
01:51:51.455 --> 01:51:53.195
All of you! Liars!

1404
01:51:53.916 --> 01:51:57.249
You‘re only happy
when you can see something die!

1405
01:51:57.419 --> 01:52:00.286
Why don't you kill yourselves
and be happy?

1406
01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:02.625
You and your God‘s country!

1407
01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:04.172
Freedom!

1408
01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:06.124
I pity you!

1409
01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:09.136
You're three dear, sweet dead men!

1410
01:52:12.643 --> 01:52:15.635
She's crazy. They‘re all crazy.

1411
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.222
You try not to believe it,
because you need them.

1412
01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:20.806
She‘s crazy.

1413
01:52:21.276 --> 01:52:24.268
You struggle, you build, you try,

1414
01:52:24.863 --> 01:52:28.651
you turn yourself inside out for them,
but it‘s never enough.

1415
01:52:29.284 --> 01:52:31.616
So they put the spurs to you.

1416
01:52:31.662 --> 01:52:33.653
I know. I got the marks.

1417
01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:37.865
I know this racket.
I just forgot what I knew.

1418
01:52:38.043 --> 01:52:40.580
Butchers! Liars!

1419
01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:42.536
I pity you!

1420
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:45.001
You're three dead men!

1421
01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:09.237
Hold this light for me, will you?

1422
01:53:18.917 --> 01:53:23.502
Buck up, boy. Before you know it,
you'll be up to your neck in dames again.

1423
01:53:25.132 --> 01:53:27.589
I don't know how we got so stupid.

1424
01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:30.880
The world is full of mountains,

1425
01:53:31.805 --> 01:53:35.514
Montana, Colorado, Canada, even Mexico.

1426
01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:38.266
Where there's mountains,
there's got to be horses.

1427
01:53:38.353 --> 01:53:41.891
We couldn't clean them out
until we‘re too weak to walk.

1428
01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:44.230
We’d work a while...

1429
01:53:44.609 --> 01:53:48.852
I could sell my house.
I don't know why I keep it, anyway.

1430
01:53:49.698 --> 01:53:53.862
Put everything into a good plane.
Get this thing on a business basis.

1431
01:53:55.329 --> 01:53:58.116
We ought to water those horses
before we weigh them in.

1432
01:53:58.206 --> 01:54:01.164
We could put 50 pounds on them.

1433
01:54:01.543 --> 01:54:03.283
We've just been fooling around here.

1434
01:54:03.378 --> 01:54:05.414
I want to get out of here.

1435
01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:08.588
With a good plane,
you could fly into Reno from anywhere.

1436
01:54:08.633 --> 01:54:12.421
Check into the Mapes,
have a good time and off we go again.

1437
01:54:12.971 --> 01:54:15.428
We wouldn‘t need anybody in this world.

1438
01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:18.757
Why don't you shut up, Guido?
Just shut up, huh?

1439
01:54:40.582 --> 01:54:42.413
Do you want me to turn them loose?

1440
01:54:42.459 --> 01:54:45.292
No. There'd just be a fight.

1441
01:55:01.978 --> 01:55:05.141
I'll meet you at the dealer's tomorrow.
We‘ll get his winch truck.

1442
01:55:05.190 --> 01:55:08.102
Don't spin the prop till I check the switch.

1443
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.570
Switch off?

1444
01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:23.997
Switch off. Throttle closed.

1445
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:29.290
Contact!

1446
01:56:45.957 --> 01:56:48.744
Go home. Go.

1447
01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.151
Help him, Perce.

1448
01:58:49.539 --> 01:58:50.745
He doesn't want any help.

1449
02:00:31.641 --> 02:00:34.633
You held him. I‘m proud of you, boy.

1450
02:00:34.769 --> 02:00:36.134
We'll get them all back tomorrow.

1451
02:00:36.771 --> 02:00:39.478
Just get your wind back.

1452
02:00:40.191 --> 02:00:44.651
Don‘t worry, we're not through here. Not
by a long shot. We're only getting started.

1453
02:00:44.821 --> 02:00:48.234
We don‘t need anybody.
You know that now, don't you?

1454
02:00:56.207 --> 02:00:58.118
What are you doing?

1455
02:01:11.347 --> 02:01:14.054
What in the hell did you catch him for?

1456
02:01:15.894 --> 02:01:19.603
I don't want nobody
making up my mind for me, that's all.

1457
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:23.640
Damn them all.

1458
02:01:23.735 --> 02:01:26.898
They changed it. Changed it all around.

1459
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:30.112
Smeared it all over with blood.

1460
02:01:32.076 --> 02:01:33.987
I‘m finished with it.

1461
02:01:36.915 --> 02:01:39.702
It's like roping a dream now.

1462
02:01:42.212 --> 02:01:45.670
Just got to find another way to be alive,
that's all.

1463
02:01:46.216 --> 02:01:48.707
If there is one anymore.

1464
02:01:53.932 --> 02:01:56.799
-Cut that mare loose for me, will you?
-Sure.

1465
02:02:04.317 --> 02:02:06.774
I‘ll drive you back, if you want.

1466
02:02:16.996 --> 02:02:19.829
I'm pleased to have met you, Roslyn.

1467
02:02:21.125 --> 02:02:23.081
Don't get hurt anymore, will you, Perce?

1468
02:02:30.593 --> 02:02:32.504
-See you around!
-Where will you be?

1469
02:02:32.595 --> 02:02:35.302
At some gas station,
polishing Windshields?

1470
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:37.597
Making change in a supermarket?

1471
02:02:37.725 --> 02:02:42.094
Try the laundromat!
They need a fellow there to load machines!

1472
02:02:59.873 --> 02:03:02.455
I‘ll leave tomorrow, okay?

1473
02:03:37.452 --> 02:03:39.443
God bless you, girl.

1474
02:04:03.811 --> 02:04:06.518
If there could be one person in the world,

1475
02:04:06.648 --> 02:04:09.560
a child who could be
brave from the beginning

1476
02:04:11.194 --> 02:04:15.437
I was scared when you asked me,
but I'm not so much now. Are you?

1477
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:18.110
No.

1478
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:23.703
How do you find your way back in the dark?

1479
02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:29.117
Just head for that big star, straight on.

1480
02:04:29.754 --> 02:04:31.915
The highway is under it.

1481
02:04:32.632 --> 02:04:34.714
It will take us right home.
