You agreed to this schedule.

981
01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:06.268
You're not even gonna
give me a reason?

982
01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:08.537
I don't know yet.

983

Goddammit.

984
01:07:10.238 --> 01:07:12.709
You know, I gave you this job
because your brother was

985

always a hard worker.

986
01:07:14.811 --> 01:07:16.578
I consider him a friend.

987
01:07:16.613 --> 01:07:18.280
But time after time,

988
01:07:18.313 --> 01:07:20.315
you keep coming up short.

989
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:22.250
And worse than that,

990
01:07:22.284 --> 01:07:25.454
you don't take responsibility
for shit.

01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:35.858
What's going on?

1004
01:08:38.995 --> 01:08:40.295
You've gotta figure out
how to stop the bleeding

1005
01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:42.564
really fast.

What?

1009
01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:56.411
Jesus Christ.

1010
01:08:56.445 --> 01:08:58.480
That makes eight dead or missing
in less than a week.

1011
01:08:58.513 --> 01:08:59.816
This is ridiculous.

1012
01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:01.017
We should be out there
busting heads,

1013
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:02.284
getting some answers.

1014
01:09:02.317 --> 01:09:04.319
Well, that's why we're here,
to figure out what to do.

1015
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.589
We know what we gotta do,

1016
01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:07.857
just no one's wanting
to say it.

1017
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.930
And what's that?

1018
01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:16.899
Only a certain kind of person's
out there doing this, right?

1019
01:09:16.933 --> 01:09:19.367
We're not talking about
a normal guy here,

1020
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.871
we're talking about
a sick bastard.

1021
01:09:21.904 --> 01:09:24.807
Each of us knows someone
who's a little...

1022
01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:27.944
so I say, we start giving
those people a visit,

1023
01:09:27.977 --> 01:09:29.645
narrowing down the pool.

1024
01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:33.348
No. You just can't start
pinning down random people.

1025
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.617
Be honest.

1026
01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:37.920
Sheriff and all y'all are in
way over your heads out there.

1027
01:09:37.954 --> 01:09:39.756
No, that's not true.

1028
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:41.591
It's just, this isn't
like anything we've ever

1029
01:09:41.624 --> 01:09:43.025
dealt with before.

1030
01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:45.360
I mean, this is
real brutal stuff.

1031
01:09:45.393 --> 01:09:46.294
All the more reason
we should be out here

1032
01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:47.864
trying to find this guy now.

1033
01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:49.098
Exactly. If we're not
doing something,

1034
01:09:49.132 --> 01:09:52.567
then we're just waiting around
to see what happens next.

1035
01:09:52.602 --> 01:09:56.571
Look, as much as I hate
to agree with Paul,

1036
01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:58.540
I got... I got kids.

1037
01:09:58.573 --> 01:09:59.809
I know you got a kid.

1038
01:10:03.813 --> 01:10:06.348
We have an obligation
to protect our families.

1039
01:10:09.852 --> 01:10:11.821
I bought a gun yesterday.

1040
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:15.858
A handgun.

1041
01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:20.630
And I suggest every one of you
do the same thing.

1042
01:10:20.663 --> 01:10:22.330
Well, I'm covered.

1043
01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:23.866
I have a hunting rifle.

1044
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.534
That's fine.

1045
01:10:25.567 --> 01:10:27.369
Yeah, I'm thinking about
getting something too.

1046
01:10:27.402 --> 01:10:28.971
I say, do it.

1047
01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:30.807
- Better safe.
- All right, look.

1048
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.507
If you wanna keep a gun
at your house,

1049
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:34.844
that's one thing,
and that's okay.

1050
01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:36.378
If you wanna be a lookout
or whatever,

1051
01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:37.914
that's all right too.

1052
01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:39.048
And this doesn't mean
I'm advocating

1053
01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:42.084
for sneaking around,
looking in someone's window.

1054
01:10:42.118 --> 01:10:44.519
But if you do find something,

1055
01:10:44.553 --> 01:10:46.689
give us a call
before you act on it.

1056
01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:49.025
Yeah, well, it's not about
what to do with him.

1057
01:10:49.058 --> 01:10:50.927
It's about finding him.

1058
01:10:54.797 --> 01:10:57.499
Well, tell you what.

1059
01:10:57.532 --> 01:10:59.702
This wasn't happening
when I grew up here.

1060
01:10:59.735 --> 01:11:01.369
Wasn't happening a year ago.

1061
01:11:01.403 --> 01:11:03.105
Wasn't happening last month.

1062
01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:05.473
Something's changed.

1063
01:11:05.507 --> 01:11:07.944
That's what we need
to be looking for.

1064
01:11:07.977 --> 01:11:11.781

Hey, Ethan.

1067
01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:20.422
I've been trying to call you.

1068
01:11:20.455 --> 01:11:21.824
I can't really wait
any longer,

1069
01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:24.492
I gotta take off.

1070
01:11:24.526 --> 01:11:28.064
I really wish
you coulda come with me.

on so many chances
