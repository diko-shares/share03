2
00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:44.947
That's great, Bunny.

3
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.215
As you know, Bunny has won...

4
00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.425
Ready to meet
that new challenger?

5
00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.662
Okay, Bunny.

6
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:04.433
Let's bring in
that new mystery challenger.

7
00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:07.003
Well, hello!

8
00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.509
Hey, Ethan, it's Lynn.

9
00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.245
Jesus, you're worse at answering
your phone than Shane.

10
00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.414
Listen, I don't remember
what time we said

11
00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:23.418
for tomorrow night,
but just come around like 6:30.

12
00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:25.520
Oh, also, Shane wanted me
to tell you,

13
00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:27.489
a few more people
are coming now.

14
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.291
I know he said
it'd just be us,

15
00:02:29.324 --> 00:02:31.326
but a few of his work friends
will be here

16
00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.029
and my friend Kristen
and her boyfriend.

17
00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:35.530
- Mom! Look what I made!
- Honey, hold on,

18
00:02:35.564 --> 00:02:36.866
I'm on the phone.

19
00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.736
I know you're gonna sleep all
day, but if you don't show up,

20
00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.871
we're coming over there
to drag you out of bed.

21
00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.271
All right.

22
00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:09.799
Alex?

23
00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:12.034
What?

24
00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:15.504
You gotta stop throwing rocks
at my mailbox.

25
00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:16.873
Why?

26
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:18.641
'Cause I park my van here.

27
00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:20.977
I don't do it
when your van's there.

28
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.646
Well, that's not true.

29
00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.848
I have a very good aim.

30
00:03:25.882 --> 00:03:27.016
Okay.

31
00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.752
Can you just stop, please?

32
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.501
Coming up, we're going to be
talking to Eve Stanley

33
00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:48.503
who, at just the age of 14

34
00:03:48.537 --> 00:03:50.372
and with her younger sister
in tow,

35
00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:52.742
escaped from what she calls
a dangerous cult

36
00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:54.476
of radical thinking.

37
00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.545
Can you tell me what
it's been like transi...

38
00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.498
You're very late.

39
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:18.067
I overslept.

40
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.770
Well, come in.

41
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:23.739
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, come on.

42
00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.145
Robin's around here somewhere.

43
00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:31.546
She's been asking
where you were.

44
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:33.716
Hey, Shane,
your brother is here.

45
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:35.651
Okay, one sec.

46
00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:38.054
You don't have to work tonight,
do you?

47
00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:40.422
Uh, no, actually.

48
00:04:40.455 --> 00:04:43.525
Do you want something to drink?
Or we have cake left over.

49
00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:45.127
Um, sure.

50
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.562
I'll just take a drink.

51
00:04:49.464 --> 00:04:50.900
I'm not on call tonight.

52
00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:53.568
I have to change some locks
in an apartment complex

53
00:04:53.603 --> 00:04:55.437
- sometime tomorrow.
- Great.

54
00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:08.584
Robin, get in here!

55
00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:16.926
Honey, did you break this?

56
00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:21.898
- Say hi to your uncle.
- Hi.

57
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.800
Honey, you have to tell me
when you do something like this.

58
00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.534
- It's very dangerous.
- How are you?

59
00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:29.537
- Whoa, what'd you break?
- I didn't, I was in my room.

60
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:30.973
Hey, honey, leave it,
I'll get a broom.

61
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:31.908
Hey, did you work tonight?

62
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:33.943
Mom, are you gonna help
me with my homework?

63
00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:36.012
Robin, honey, wait.

64
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:38.581
Uh, no.

65
00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:40.650
Okay, well, you want some cake?

66
00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:43.686
No, I'm okay.

67
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:44.887
Sure?

68
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:46.656
It's good.

69
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:52.595
You can always exchange it

70
00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:55.698
if you already have one.

71
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:56.999
What's that?

72
00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:58.466
The flashlight.

73
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.670
Oh, no, I...
I don't have a nice one.

74
00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:03.205
Robin picked it out.

75
00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:04.907
When she heard
you worked nights,

76
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.010
she was very concerned with you
getting lost in the dark.

77
00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:08.911
- Huh.
- And hey,

78
00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:12.715
I know we missed your birthday,
but, um...

79
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:16.518
I figured tonight would be
a good time to give it to you.

80
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.922
I mean, it's just from my store,
so if you want something else...

81
00:06:19.956 --> 00:06:21.624
No, I'm definitely
gonna keep it.

82
00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.636
But, uh...

83
00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.537
Hey, you should open this now.

84
00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:38.908
Easy there, buddy.

85
00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:44.880
Uh, it's not like...
I didn't buy anything.

86
00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:47.883
I found it in the back
of my closet.

87
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.123
From that board game
we used to play growing up.

88
00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:57.559
That was your piece.

89
00:06:57.593 --> 00:06:59.996
I still have mine
back at home too.

90
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:01.797
That's sweet.

91
00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:04.600
Well, what happened
to the rest of the game?

92
00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:06.769
I think it got lost in the move.

93
00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:10.239
Well, we kinda need the rest
of the game though, right?

94
00:07:10.272 --> 00:07:11.207
Oh, yeah.

95
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.710
I just thought it would be
cool to have it.

96
00:07:14.744 --> 00:07:16.912
Mom,

97
00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:19.281
what time is it?

98
00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:22.251
It's very late, honey.

99
00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:23.819
I'll take her up.

100
00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:25.321
Come here, sweetheart.

101
00:07:25.354 --> 00:07:27.289
All right, here we go.

102
00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:31.093
All right, let's get you to bed.

103
00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:40.236
Okay, folks, now,
sometimes we get articles

104
00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:43.305
coming to the club that are
sometimes fun and extravagant.

105
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.107
Well, we have something
coming up next

106
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.009
that has to do with your health.

107
00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:48.644
This is very important.

108
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.713
Now, do you know someone
in your family

109
00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:53.716
that needs to watch their pulse
or their blood pressure?

110
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:56.318
It's something that's
very, very important to do.

111
00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:57.920
We have, back again...

112
00:10:46.088 --> 00:10:47.356
Hello?

113
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:49.792
Uh, hi, Lynn, it's Ethan.

114
00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:52.228
Ethan? What's wrong?

115
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.430
Uh, nothing, sorry.

116
00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:56.298
I thought I called
Shane's phone.

117
00:10:56.332 --> 00:10:57.499
Is he there?

118
00:10:57.533 --> 00:10:59.134
Yeah, he's sleeping.

119
00:10:59.168 --> 00:11:00.436
We're both sleeping.

120
00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:01.837
What's going on?

121
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.339
I...

122
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:06.108
just found something.

123
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:07.810
I really think he'd like it.

124
00:11:07.843 --> 00:11:10.145
I was thinking
he could come out and see it.

125
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:13.148
Ethan, it's four o'clock
in the morning.

126
00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:16.018
Oh, right, sorry,
I know, it's...

127
00:11:18.187 --> 00:11:22.157
It's just, I've never seen
anything like it. I thought he...

128
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:25.327
I'm sure you can show him
whatever it is tomorrow.

129
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:28.197
- Well, I really can't...
- Good night, Ethan.

130
00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:32.268
I can't just...

131
00:13:53.275 --> 00:13:56.412
Listen, I ain't gonna sugarcoat
this for you, folks.

132
00:13:56.445 --> 00:13:58.480
Our days on this earth
are numbered.

133
00:13:58.514 --> 00:14:01.183
All you have to do
is walk down the street

134
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.585
or turn your television on

135
00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:05.254
to see that we are living
in the last days.

136
00:14:05.287 --> 00:14:07.590
Make yourself right with God.

137
00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:18.066
Hey, this is Shane Daunes.

138
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.068
I can't get to the phone
right now,

139
00:14:20.102 --> 00:14:21.437
but if you'll leave
your name and...

140
00:17:11.306 --> 00:17:13.241
Hey, I couldn't get you
on your phone.

141
00:17:14.644 --> 00:17:17.512
I forget it in
my glove compartment sometimes.

142
00:17:17.546 --> 00:17:19.147
Right, uh, hey,

143
00:17:19.181 --> 00:17:22.585
there was something
that I wanted you to come see.

144
00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:25.688
Well, where is it?

145
00:17:25.722 --> 00:17:27.824
It's back at my place.

146
00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:32.461
Well, what is it?

147
00:17:32.494 --> 00:17:34.529
It's... I don't even know.

148
00:17:34.563 --> 00:17:36.398
You just gotta see it.

149
00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.836
Okay, well, I can't right now.

150
00:17:39.869 --> 00:17:41.503
Well, it's not gonna take long.

151
00:17:41.536 --> 00:17:44.239
I could give you a lift over.

152
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.781
Well, hey, dude, uh,
did Lynn get in touch with you?

153
00:17:51.814 --> 00:17:53.382
Uh, no.

154
00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:55.484
Why?

155
00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.486
We were just gonna see
if you wouldn't mind

156
00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:01.423
watching Robin tomorrow,
just for the evening,

157
00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:04.827
'cause we're supposed to go see
Lynn's, uh, cousin's wedding,

158
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:06.461
Eric.

159
00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:08.631
It's all the way out in Dover,

160
00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:10.733
and Christina called
this morning and said

161
00:18:10.767 --> 00:18:12.869
she wasn't gonna be able
to make it,

162
00:18:12.902 --> 00:18:16.204
probably for some reason
she made up.

163
00:18:16.238 --> 00:18:18.841
You don't work, do you?

164
00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:20.610
No.

165
00:18:20.643 --> 00:18:24.379
I've never really taken care
of her before.

166
00:18:24.413 --> 00:18:27.950
Well, it's not that hard,
I mean, she loves you.

167
00:18:27.984 --> 00:18:30.953
Yeah...

168
00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:33.723
Look, it's just one night.

169
00:18:33.756 --> 00:18:35.858
It'd really mean a lot to us.

170
00:18:39.862 --> 00:18:41.597
Okay, yeah.

171
00:18:43.398 --> 00:18:45.702
Well, can you show me
whatever it is

172
00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:47.235
when I pick her up?

173
00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:48.503
Yeah, sure.

174
00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:50.372
All right, great.

175
00:18:56.579 --> 00:18:59.716
Oh, hey, uh, did you hear?

176
00:18:59.749 --> 00:19:02.317
Connie's back in town, visiting.

177
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.286
We were gonna try
to get together with her

178
00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:07.289
while she's here,
if you want to see her.

179
00:19:07.322 --> 00:19:11.594
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

180
00:19:11.627 --> 00:19:14.563
Okay, just let me know.

181
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.839
Hey!

182
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.109
What are you doin' out here?

183
00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:10.713
Uh, nothing,
I was just looking around.

184
00:21:10.746 --> 00:21:12.882
It's the middle of the night.

185
00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.487
Why are you trying
to get in there?

186
00:21:19.521 --> 00:21:20.723
I don't know.

187
00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:22.925
I've seen you creeping around
out here.

188
00:21:22.959 --> 00:21:25.127
You can't do that,
this is my private property.

189
00:21:25.161 --> 00:21:27.129
Whatever, you rent this out
from my dad.

190
00:21:27.163 --> 00:21:29.999
All right,
would you just go home?

191
00:21:30.032 --> 00:21:31.433
Yeah, fine.

192
00:21:40.542 --> 00:21:41.644
Hello?

193
00:21:41.677 --> 00:21:44.981
Mike, uh, I don't think
I can be on call tonight.

194
00:21:45.014 --> 00:21:47.083
Um, I'm not really feeling well.

195
00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:49.585
Oh, uh... all right.

196
00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:51.888
I'll see if Brody
can cover for you.

197
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:54.489
I'm sure he'd like
something to do.

198
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.826
Okay, sorry.

199
00:23:29.285 --> 00:23:31.887
Do you do good in school?

200
00:23:31.921 --> 00:23:34.023
Yeah.

201
00:23:34.056 --> 00:23:36.558
I used to always have to help
your dad with his math

202
00:23:36.592 --> 00:23:39.095
'cause I was older.

203
00:23:39.128 --> 00:23:42.064
I was really bad at math.

204
00:23:42.098 --> 00:23:44.532
So, he used to always get
in trouble

205
00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:46.802
because I'd teach him
everything wrong.

206
00:23:46.836 --> 00:23:47.970
Really?

207
00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:50.572
Yeah.

208
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.875
Oh, wow.

209
00:23:52.908 --> 00:23:54.310
That's funny.

210
00:23:56.712 --> 00:23:58.881
So, your dad, he works a lot.

211
00:23:58.914 --> 00:24:02.318
Like, do you ever get to spend
any time with him?

212
00:24:02.351 --> 00:24:04.854
Um, yeah.

213
00:24:04.887 --> 00:24:06.322
When he gets home every day,

214
00:24:06.355 --> 00:24:08.190
we play a game or something,

215
00:24:08.224 --> 00:24:10.059
like go on a walk.

216
00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:15.264
Hey, finish up.
I want to show you something.

217
00:24:25.207 --> 00:24:27.309
Your dad ever take you
down here?

218
00:24:29.645 --> 00:24:32.181
Um, I don't think so.

219
00:24:49.632 --> 00:24:51.834
- You see that house over there?
- Yeah.

220
00:24:51.867 --> 00:24:55.838
Your dad and I grew up there,

221
00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:58.074
when we were your age,

222
00:24:58.107 --> 00:25:01.277
till I was 13 and he was 12.

223
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.778
Really?

224
00:25:04.814 --> 00:25:07.850
Yeah.

225
00:25:07.883 --> 00:25:10.619
One day I'm gonna move
back in there.

226
00:25:11.921 --> 00:25:14.924
Does someone else live
in there now?

227
00:25:14.957 --> 00:25:17.626
Uh, no.

228
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.696
Not for a while now.

229
00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:23.365
So why can't you just go back?

230
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:30.372
Uh, I mean, I'm working on it.

231
00:25:30.406 --> 00:25:33.309
Just trying to save up
some money.

232
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.089
Hello?

233
00:26:20.122 --> 00:26:23.292
Hey, Ethan?

234
00:26:23.325 --> 00:26:26.262
It's... Connie.

235
00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:28.430
Sorry if I woke you up.

236
00:26:28.464 --> 00:26:30.199
N-no, it's fine.

237
00:26:30.232 --> 00:26:33.002
Um, how've you been?

238
00:26:33.035 --> 00:26:35.404
Good, um, pretty good.

239
00:26:35.437 --> 00:26:36.772
Thanks.

240
00:26:36.805 --> 00:26:40.276
I, um, actually just got
into town, just...

241
00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:42.011
just for the week.

242
00:26:42.044 --> 00:26:45.881
I hope it's okay,
I got your number from Lynn.

243
00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:48.050
I just thought
I'd give you a call

244
00:26:48.083 --> 00:26:52.254
and see if you wanted
to get together while I'm here.

245
00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:56.025
- Okay.
- I'm here visiting my grandma,

246
00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:58.794
but other than that,
I'm pretty free.

247
00:26:58.827 --> 00:27:00.296
We should catch up.

248
00:27:00.329 --> 00:27:01.797
All right.

249
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.499
Great.

250
00:27:03.532 --> 00:27:06.368
Well, just give me
a call whenever.

251
00:27:06.402 --> 00:27:08.771
We can figure something out.

252
00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:12.408
Okay, bye.

253
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.088
Dad!

254
00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:16.659
Hey!

255
00:30:16.693 --> 00:30:18.595
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah.

256
00:30:18.628 --> 00:30:19.662
Yeah?

257
00:30:19.696 --> 00:30:21.530
Take care of this guy for me?

258
00:30:21.563 --> 00:30:22.665
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

259
00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:29.706
- Did you have a good time?
- Uh, yeah.

260
00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:31.173
That's good.

261
00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:32.941
Was the wedding pretty?

262
00:30:32.975 --> 00:30:34.309
It was long.

263
00:30:34.343 --> 00:30:36.378
- But, hey, we got you something.
- You did?

264
00:30:36.412 --> 00:30:40.015
- Yeah, go look in the truck.
- Okay.

265
00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:42.284
Hey, thanks again, man.

266
00:30:42.317 --> 00:30:44.353
Yeah, no problem.

267
00:30:47.456 --> 00:30:50.660
Hey, what's going on over there?

268
00:30:56.331 --> 00:30:58.400
Uh... I don't know.

269
00:31:00.335 --> 00:31:04.573
Oh, what was it
you wanted to show me?

270
00:31:04.607 --> 00:31:06.575
Uh, it's nothing.

271
00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:09.077
You sure? You seemed
pretty excited about it.

272
00:31:14.483 --> 00:31:16.485
All right, well,

273
00:31:16.518 --> 00:31:18.353
I'll see ya.

274
00:31:21.691 --> 00:31:24.393
- Ethan?
- Yeah, I'm here.

275
00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:26.295
Feeling any better?

276
00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:28.631
What? Uh, yeah.

277
00:31:28.665 --> 00:31:30.065
I'm... I'm good.

278
00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:33.035
Good, I got a commercial lockout
for you.

279
00:31:33.068 --> 00:31:35.638
510 Slane Road.

280
00:32:28.123 --> 00:32:30.292
You Ethan?

281
00:32:30.325 --> 00:32:31.360
Yeah.

282
00:32:31.393 --> 00:32:32.795
Okay, where're you goin'?

283
00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:33.796
What?

284
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.732
Where're you driving to?

285
00:32:35.765 --> 00:32:36.833
I'm going to work.

286
00:32:36.866 --> 00:32:40.369
You know the kid who lives
next-door to you, Alex?

287
00:32:40.402 --> 00:32:41.270
Yeah.

288
00:32:41.303 --> 00:32:43.572
When's the last time
you seen him?

289
00:32:43.606 --> 00:32:46.308
W-why? Is everything okay?

290
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:49.846
Yeah. When's the last time
you seen him?

291
00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:53.750
Last night, or last... afternoon.

292
00:32:53.783 --> 00:32:56.385
When I got home,
he was riding his bike.

293
00:32:56.418 --> 00:32:57.787
And what time was that?

294
00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.823
I don't know,
it was before five.

295
00:33:00.857 --> 00:33:02.391
Yeah.

296
00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:05.427
You're a locksmith?

297
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.296
Is that a lonely job,

298
00:33:07.329 --> 00:33:10.600
driving around in the dark?

299
00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:13.135
You got any family
who lives with you?

300
00:33:13.168 --> 00:33:14.871
No, I don't.

301
00:33:14.904 --> 00:33:17.539
No one else in your house?

302
00:33:17.573 --> 00:33:19.408
Look, I need to go to work.

303
00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.177
Please.

304
00:33:24.714 --> 00:33:26.649
All right, don't go far.

305
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:29.819
In case we need to reach you.

306
00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:41.898
Hey!

307
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:43.666
Thank God.

308
00:33:45.802 --> 00:33:47.770
Are you Aaron?

309
00:33:47.804 --> 00:33:49.538
Yeah.

310
00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:52.140
Which door?

311
00:33:52.174 --> 00:33:53.408
Any.

312
00:33:53.442 --> 00:33:55.143
Front door, I guess.

313
00:33:55.177 --> 00:33:58.748
There's three doors,
and they're all locked.

314
00:34:05.253 --> 00:34:08.123
Hey, uh, how long do you think
this is gonna take?

315
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:11.293
Just a minute.

316
00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:13.161
Cool, cool.

317
00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:16.431
Uh, 'cause the parents get
pretty pissy when they get here

318
00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:18.467
and we're not open yet.

319
00:34:36.518 --> 00:34:39.454
Do the kids play out there,
by the woods?

320
00:34:39.488 --> 00:34:43.325
Oh, sure, anywhere they can roll
around in some dirt.

321
00:35:04.413 --> 00:35:06.248
Authorities have called off
the search

322
00:35:06.281 --> 00:35:07.850
for a local missing teen.

323
00:35:07.884 --> 00:35:10.987
Alex Birman was reported missing
from his family home

324
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.088
last Tuesday.

325
00:35:12.121 --> 00:35:15.625
More than 80 volunteers,
a search and rescue team,

326
00:35:15.658 --> 00:35:18.695
and a K-9 unit helped
in the efforts to find him.

327
00:35:33.508 --> 00:35:35.510
One second, hold on,
I'm coming.

328
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.514
Hey, man, what's up?

329
00:35:39.548 --> 00:35:42.517
Sorry, I didn't hear you knock.

330
00:35:42.551 --> 00:35:45.621
Come on, it's in the car.

331
00:35:45.655 --> 00:35:48.758
Uh, Walter, my dog,

332
00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:50.893
usually goes crazy
when someone's at the door,

333
00:35:50.927 --> 00:35:55.363
so that's... that's my indication
that someone's here.

334
00:35:55.397 --> 00:35:59.434
And, uh, I'm pretty sure my ex
came back and probably took him.

335
00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:03.005
So, now I'm twice as lonely.

336
00:36:09.946 --> 00:36:12.715
Those are already keyed,
all five of 'em.

337
00:36:12.749 --> 00:36:15.585
Well, thanks for doing this.

338
00:36:15.618 --> 00:36:18.487
And, well, thanks for covering
my shift last week too.

339
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.488
Yeah, no problem.

340
00:36:19.521 --> 00:36:21.456
The, uh, the key's in there.

341
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.326
I didn't make any copies
'cause I didn't know

342
00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:26.328
how many you needed.

343
00:36:26.361 --> 00:36:28.396
No, this is fine.

344
00:36:30.332 --> 00:36:32.835
Hey, uh,
you doing anything tonight?

345
00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:35.370
I was just gonna go to, like,
a bar or something.

346
00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:36.973
- I didn't know...
- My brother invited me

347
00:36:37.006 --> 00:36:38.841
for dinner,
I'm headed there now.

348
00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:40.342
- Oh, okay.
- So...

349
00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:43.012
Maybe, uh, maybe next time
we can do something.

350
00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:44.479
Yeah.

351
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:51.587
And if... if you ever need
anything, you know, whatever,

352
00:36:51.621 --> 00:36:53.689
just let me know.

353
00:36:53.723 --> 00:36:57.894
I'm usually bored
most of the time, so.

354
00:36:57.927 --> 00:37:00.863
- Yeah, I'll let you know.
- Okay, cool.

355
00:37:00.897 --> 00:37:02.965
I'll see you then.

356
00:37:23.385 --> 00:37:25.054
Come in.

357
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.427
Hey.

358
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.831
Whose car's out there?

359
00:37:41.671 --> 00:37:43.371
It's been just insane.

360
00:37:43.405 --> 00:37:45.908
Seems like I picked
a bad time to come back.

361
00:37:45.942 --> 00:37:49.411
Yeah, I don't even want to let
Robin play in the backyard

362
00:37:49.444 --> 00:37:51.647
without me being there
to watch her.

363
00:37:51.681 --> 00:37:54.650
It's just one more reason
why we're...

364
00:37:54.684 --> 00:37:58.020
Well, I don't know.

365
00:37:58.054 --> 00:37:59.689
They don't have any idea
who it is?

366
00:37:59.722 --> 00:38:01.691
When it was just
the Birman kid,

367
00:38:01.724 --> 00:38:03.693
some guys were saying
it was his dad,

368
00:38:03.726 --> 00:38:05.728
'cause he's a little off

369
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:07.930
and the mother's
out of the picture.

370
00:38:07.964 --> 00:38:12.902
But, I mean, there's been, like,
five people missing since then,

371
00:38:12.935 --> 00:38:14.904
or found dead,

372
00:38:14.937 --> 00:38:16.906
and it's pretty violent stuff.

373
00:38:16.939 --> 00:38:18.741
What do you mean?

374
00:38:18.774 --> 00:38:22.044
Well, I got my one friend
who's a cop,

375
00:38:22.078 --> 00:38:24.013
and he said that, uh, Mitch,

376
00:38:24.046 --> 00:38:27.850
who me and Ethan
used to know growing up,

377
00:38:27.884 --> 00:38:32.655
they found him in his car,
in his driveway.

378
00:38:32.688 --> 00:38:35.124
It was a pretty gory scene,
is what he said.

379
00:38:35.157 --> 00:38:36.359
Oh my God.

380
00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:39.595
I just can't believe
it's happening here, you know?

381
00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:42.497
That someone in this town
could do something like that.

382
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.767
I keep telling Ethan,
you better be careful.

383
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.903
Yeah, Jesus.

384
00:38:46.936 --> 00:38:48.971
I mean, you do live alone

385
00:38:49.005 --> 00:38:53.142
and kinda got a...
axe murderer look going on.

386
00:38:54.644 --> 00:38:56.145
I don't know,
maybe you might wanna...

387
00:38:56.178 --> 00:38:57.847
Shane!

388
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.016
That's horrible.

389
00:39:00.049 --> 00:39:01.584
He's kidding.

390
00:39:10.525 --> 00:39:13.029
I'll... be right back.

391
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.170
I don't understand why you
always have to do it like that.

392
00:39:21.203 --> 00:39:23.005
- It's fine.
- No...

393
00:39:52.234 --> 00:39:55.805
I'll be right back.
Do you guys need anything?

394
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.175
Hey.

395
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:03.511
You all right?

396
00:40:04.146 --> 00:40:06.582
Uh, yeah. Fine.

397
00:40:13.122 --> 00:40:14.757
Hey, listen, um...

398
00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:21.230
You guys sell a lot
of security cameras, right?

399
00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:24.166
I mean, like, you know
how to install 'em?

400
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.168
Uh, yeah.

401
00:40:26.202 --> 00:40:28.104
Okay, good, good,
'cause I'm thinking

402
00:40:28.137 --> 00:40:32.208
about putting some up here
around the house.

403
00:40:32.241 --> 00:40:34.944
Is that weird?

404
00:40:34.977 --> 00:40:38.581
I mean, people do that, right?

405
00:40:38.614 --> 00:40:42.218
I've done a few houses.

406
00:40:42.251 --> 00:40:44.720
Is there a reason?

407
00:40:44.754 --> 00:40:47.123
I don't know, I just, uh...

408
00:40:47.156 --> 00:40:51.894
Maybe with everything that's
been going on here lately, I...

409
00:40:51.927 --> 00:40:55.297
I'm getting to feel
a little paranoid.

410
00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:58.566
You have the security alarm
system here.

411
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:01.904
No, I mean, yeah, you're right,
it's just, uh...

412
00:41:03.773 --> 00:41:07.610
Look, I'm probably
making this up, but...

413
00:41:07.643 --> 00:41:10.212
the other night,

414
00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:13.616
I woke up and I swear
I heard someone

415
00:41:13.649 --> 00:41:17.119
walking around and moving
out in the backyard.

416
00:41:18.988 --> 00:41:21.290
And I didn't see anyone,

417
00:41:21.323 --> 00:41:25.327
but I just felt, like,
freaked out.

418
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:28.631
I didn't tell Lynn or anything,

419
00:41:28.664 --> 00:41:31.100
but it's just been on my mind,

420
00:41:31.133 --> 00:41:34.837
and I just thought, you know,
if we have a camera out there,

421
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:39.975
and since you do that anyways,
it'd be...

422
00:41:40.009 --> 00:41:41.977
Yeah.

423
00:41:42.011 --> 00:41:44.613
Yeah, I can do it.

424
00:41:44.647 --> 00:41:46.182
Okay.

425
00:41:50.386 --> 00:41:54.090
Look, uh...

426
00:41:54.123 --> 00:41:58.961
Connie asked us
to invite you here tonight.

427
00:41:58.994 --> 00:42:00.963
I'm just saying.

428
00:42:02.431 --> 00:42:04.733
Her whole class went
on a nature walk

429
00:42:04.767 --> 00:42:06.001
and had a picnic there.

430
00:42:06.035 --> 00:42:08.104
Robin's been begging me
to take her back,

431
00:42:08.137 --> 00:42:09.972
but with everything
that's going on,

432
00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:11.340
I just don't feel comfortable.

433
00:42:11.373 --> 00:42:14.143
Uh, hey, I'm gonna take off.

434
00:42:14.176 --> 00:42:15.711
What?

435
00:42:17.379 --> 00:42:19.682
It was good seeing you.

436
00:45:00.442 --> 00:45:02.811
Hey! Stop!

437
00:45:06.248 --> 00:45:08.984
What the fuck are you doing?

438
00:45:13.455 --> 00:45:16.593
You're... you're that cop.

439
00:45:24.066 --> 00:45:25.834
I'm a friend
of the Birman family.

440
00:45:25.868 --> 00:45:26.902
- What?
- They're all real worried

441
00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:28.904
about Alex, they just want
to see him back home.

442
00:45:28.937 --> 00:45:31.073
I told you, I don't know
what happened to him, okay?

443
00:45:31.106 --> 00:45:32.141
Yeah, I don't believe you,

444
00:45:32.174 --> 00:45:34.209
'cause I can look someone
in the eye and tell

445
00:45:34.243 --> 00:45:36.613
when they're being straight
with me or lying to my face.

446
00:45:36.646 --> 00:45:38.881
This is... this is not okay,

447
00:45:38.914 --> 00:45:40.382
what... what you're doing
right now.

448
00:45:40.416 --> 00:45:41.950
No, no, I don't care
what you think.

449
00:45:41.984 --> 00:45:43.218
I don't give a shit,

450
00:45:43.252 --> 00:45:45.020
'cause I've been keeping
my eye on you,

451
00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:46.589
and you're a real freak.

452
00:45:46.623 --> 00:45:48.424
You're a real piece of work.

453
00:45:50.526 --> 00:45:52.995
No, all right, I'm...
I'm leaving.

454
00:45:53.028 --> 00:45:54.631
Oh, I'm not gonna stop you,

455
00:45:54.664 --> 00:45:57.600
but the next time I see you,
I ain't gonna be alone,

456
00:45:57.634 --> 00:46:01.003
and I promise you, you'll have
some answers for me then.

457
00:46:02.304 --> 00:46:04.039
Hey, are you listening to me?

458
00:46:04.073 --> 00:46:06.875
I'm about one second from taking
that flashlight out of your hand

459
00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:08.077
and bashing in your fucking...

460
00:47:26.689 --> 00:47:29.224
Sorry to just show up.

461
00:47:29.258 --> 00:47:32.327
I just knew I'd regret it
if I didn't get a chance

462
00:47:32.361 --> 00:47:34.563
to talk to you
while I was here.

463
00:47:34.597 --> 00:47:36.965
Yeah, I was gonna call you
and then...

464
00:47:39.501 --> 00:47:41.738
Can I ask you something?

465
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:45.474
Did you ever regret
not leaving with me?

466
00:47:50.647 --> 00:47:54.283
Yeah, I think I did, back then.

467
00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:56.686
I always kinda thought
you'd make it outta here,

468
00:47:56.719 --> 00:47:59.521
eventually.

469
00:47:59.555 --> 00:48:04.059
But you never left?

470
00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:06.562
Uh... no.

471
00:48:06.596 --> 00:48:11.133
What's been keeping you here
all this time?

472
00:48:11.166 --> 00:48:13.168
I don't know.

473
00:48:13.202 --> 00:48:16.138
I got a lot
of good memories here.

474
00:48:17.072 --> 00:48:19.308
I think you stay
in one place too long

475
00:48:19.341 --> 00:48:21.243
and you'll get yourself
mixed up with it,

476
00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:24.446
then you have no choice
but to just... get out.

477
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.548
Some problems can't follow you.

478
00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:28.751
They're rooted in a place.

479
00:48:28.785 --> 00:48:31.688
I don't think
I can outrun my problems.

480
00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:35.157
But you haven't tried?

481
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.551
I'm sorry.

482
00:49:02.585 --> 00:49:04.186
There was a spider.

483
00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:05.788
No, it's okay.

484
00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:10.259
I'm not scared of spiders.

485
00:49:10.292 --> 00:49:12.528
I'm not like, um...

486
00:49:12.561 --> 00:49:14.496
It just startled me.

487
00:49:16.398 --> 00:49:18.100
Do you have a broom?

488
00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:20.168
No, I'll get it.

489
00:49:23.305 --> 00:49:24.674
Oh, wow.

490
00:49:24.707 --> 00:49:26.275
You found it.

491
00:49:26.308 --> 00:49:28.343
Here, let me get out of the way.

492
00:49:43.559 --> 00:49:45.527
This is weird to see.

493
00:49:47.664 --> 00:49:50.132
You don't have yours?

494
00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:52.334
No.

495
00:49:52.367 --> 00:49:54.436
I lost mine years ago.

496
00:50:08.283 --> 00:50:11.253
Ethan, I want to help you.

497
00:50:12.622 --> 00:50:15.557
What?

498
00:50:15.592 --> 00:50:18.628
Most of the people
I haven't seen in ten years,

499
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:21.163
I just forget
they exist entirely,

500
00:50:21.196 --> 00:50:24.366
but you've always
sort of stayed on my mind,

501
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:28.236
and being back here,
seeing you like this,

502
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:31.139
I, uh, I feel bad
for leaving you here.

503
00:50:34.443 --> 00:50:36.545
I leave tomorrow at two.

504
00:50:36.579 --> 00:50:38.447
Just come with me.

505
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.315
Just for a bit,

506
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:42.317
to see what's out there for you

507
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:46.154
and to forget about this place
for a while.

508
00:50:46.188 --> 00:50:49.157
What do... where?

509
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:50.727
Wherever.

510
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.729
Outta here.

511
00:50:59.836 --> 00:51:03.940
I think if you stay here
one more day,

512
00:51:03.973 --> 00:51:06.274
you'll never get out.

513
01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:57.299
No! No.

514
01:02:31.293 --> 01:02:33.128
What is it?

515
01:04:39.488 --> 01:04:42.991
Sorry 'bout that.

516
01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:46.495
It's fine.

517
01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.575
Thanks for the ride.

518
01:04:59.609 --> 01:05:01.611
Hope it wasn't
too far out of the way.

519
01:05:01.644 --> 01:05:04.012
No worries.

520
01:05:04.046 --> 01:05:06.683
I'm happy to help.

521
01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.692
So what are you doing
out here?

522
01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:20.229
Uh... just going for
a walk in the woods.

523
01:05:20.262 --> 01:05:24.601
Got turned around,
came out here.

524
01:05:24.634 --> 01:05:27.302
You do a lot of hiking?

525
01:05:27.336 --> 01:05:28.470
No.

526
01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.687
Is it on?

527
01:05:44.721 --> 01:05:47.389
No. Wait...

528
01:05:47.422 --> 01:05:51.226
Uh... yeah, there you go.

529
01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:55.063
You can click on the window
if you wanna zoom.

530
01:05:55.097 --> 01:05:57.634
Or you might have to use
the numbers.

531
01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:00.670
Okay. Well, it looks great.

532
01:06:00.703 --> 01:06:02.739
Hey, uh,
are you working tonight?

533
01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:07.543
Uh, no.

534
01:06:07.576 --> 01:06:09.612
What's up?

535
01:06:09.646 --> 01:06:13.650
Well... I'm gonna be
meeting up with some people

536
01:06:13.683 --> 01:06:15.450
later this evening,

537
01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:18.655
and I think you should come.

538
01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:20.289
Think it'd be good.

539
01:06:22.257 --> 01:06:24.159
Okay, yeah.

540
01:06:24.192 --> 01:06:25.327
All right. Well, listen,

541
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.864
just don't mention it
to Lynn, okay?

542
01:06:27.897 --> 01:06:29.197
'Cause I just told her
it was you and I

543
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:30.667
hanging out tonight.

544
01:06:31.801 --> 01:06:33.770
Sure.

545
01:06:33.803 --> 01:06:35.137
All right.

546
01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:39.742
Hey, Mike, it's Ethan.

547
01:06:39.776 --> 01:06:44.413
You don't have me on call
for tonight, do you?

548
01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:47.750
Uh, yes I do. Why?

549
01:06:47.784 --> 01:06:50.519
Shit. Um...

550
01:06:50.552 --> 01:06:54.189
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it.

551
01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:58.427
Or at least,
I can't come in till later.

552
01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.262
Ethan?

553
01:07:00.295 --> 01:07:03.600
You agreed to this schedule.

554
01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:06.268
You're not even gonna
give me a reason?

555
01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:08.537
I don't know yet.

556
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.205
Goddammit.

557
01:07:10.238 --> 01:07:12.709
You know, I gave you this job
because your brother was

558
01:07:12.742 --> 01:07:14.777
always a hard worker.

559
01:07:14.811 --> 01:07:16.578
I consider him a friend.

560
01:07:16.613 --> 01:07:18.280
But time after time,

561
01:07:18.313 --> 01:07:20.315
you keep coming up short.

562
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:22.250
And worse than that,

563
01:07:22.284 --> 01:07:25.454
you don't take responsibility
for shit.

564
01:07:25.487 --> 01:07:29.358
I'm... I'm not gonna be able
to use you anymore.

565
01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:32.227
Get the van back to me
this week.

566
01:07:33.696 --> 01:07:35.497
Ethan?

567
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.432
Did you hear me?

568
01:07:37.466 --> 01:07:41.503
Yeah. Don't mention this
to Shane, okay?

569
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.648
Oh, hey, guys,
come on in.

570
01:08:29.952 --> 01:08:32.421
It's like the third one.

571
01:08:32.454 --> 01:08:34.691
What's going on, man,
how you doing?

572
01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:35.858
What's going on?

573
01:08:38.995 --> 01:08:40.295
You've gotta figure out
how to stop the bleeding

574
01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:42.564
really fast.

575
01:08:49.639 --> 01:08:52.340
They just found Nathan Ridgemore
on the side of the highway.

576
01:08:52.374 --> 01:08:54.576
What?

577
01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:56.411
Jesus Christ.

578
01:08:56.445 --> 01:08:58.480
That makes eight dead or missing
in less than a week.

579
01:08:58.513 --> 01:08:59.816
This is ridiculous.

580
01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:01.017
We should be out there
busting heads,

581
01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:02.284
getting some answers.

582
01:09:02.317 --> 01:09:04.319
Well, that's why we're here,
to figure out what to do.

583
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.589
We know what we gotta do,

584
01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:07.857
just no one's wanting
to say it.

585
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.930
And what's that?

586
01:09:13.963 --> 01:09:16.899
Only a certain kind of person's
out there doing this, right?

587
01:09:16.933 --> 01:09:19.367
We're not talking about
a normal guy here,

588
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.871
we're talking about
a sick bastard.

589
01:09:21.904 --> 01:09:24.807
Each of us knows someone
who's a little...

590
01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:27.944
so I say, we start giving
those people a visit,

591
01:09:27.977 --> 01:09:29.645
narrowing down the pool.

592
01:09:29.679 --> 01:09:33.348
No. You just can't start
pinning down random people.

593
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.617
Be honest.

594
01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:37.920
Sheriff and all y'all are in
way over your heads out there.

595
01:09:37.954 --> 01:09:39.756
No, that's not true.

596
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:41.591
It's just, this isn't
like anything we've ever

597
01:09:41.624 --> 01:09:43.025
dealt with before.

598
01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:45.360
I mean, this is
real brutal stuff.

599
01:09:45.393 --> 01:09:46.294
All the more reason
we should be out here

600
01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:47.864
trying to find this guy now.

601
01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:49.098
Exactly. If we're not
doing something,

602
01:09:49.132 --> 01:09:52.567
then we're just waiting around
to see what happens next.

603
01:09:52.602 --> 01:09:56.571
Look, as much as I hate
to agree with Paul,

604
01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:58.540
I got... I got kids.

605
01:09:58.573 --> 01:09:59.809
I know you got a kid.

606
01:10:03.813 --> 01:10:06.348
We have an obligation
to protect our families.

607
01:10:09.852 --> 01:10:11.821
I bought a gun yesterday.

608
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:15.858
A handgun.

609
01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:20.630
And I suggest every one of you
do the same thing.

610
01:10:20.663 --> 01:10:22.330
Well, I'm covered.

611
01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:23.866
I have a hunting rifle.

612
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.534
That's fine.

613
01:10:25.567 --> 01:10:27.369
Yeah, I'm thinking about
getting something too.

614
01:10:27.402 --> 01:10:28.971
I say, do it.

615
01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:30.807
- Better safe.
- All right, look.

616
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.507
If you wanna keep a gun
at your house,

617
01:10:32.541 --> 01:10:34.844
that's one thing,
and that's okay.

618
01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:36.378
If you wanna be a lookout
or whatever,

619
01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:37.914
that's all right too.

620
01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:39.048
And this doesn't mean
I'm advocating

621
01:10:39.081 --> 01:10:42.084
for sneaking around,
looking in someone's window.

622
01:10:42.118 --> 01:10:44.519
But if you do find something,

623
01:10:44.553 --> 01:10:46.689
give us a call
before you act on it.

624
01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:49.025
Yeah, well, it's not about
what to do with him.

625
01:10:49.058 --> 01:10:50.927
It's about finding him.

626
01:10:54.797 --> 01:10:57.499
Well, tell you what.

627
01:10:57.532 --> 01:10:59.702
This wasn't happening
when I grew up here.

628
01:10:59.735 --> 01:11:01.369
Wasn't happening a year ago.

629
01:11:01.403 --> 01:11:03.105
Wasn't happening last month.

630
01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:05.473
Something's changed.

631
01:11:05.507 --> 01:11:07.944
That's what we need
to be looking for.

632
01:11:07.977 --> 01:11:11.781
Who doesn't belong?

633
01:11:16.118 --> 01:11:18.020
Hey, Ethan.

634
01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:20.422
I've been trying to call you.

635
01:11:20.455 --> 01:11:21.824
I can't really wait
any longer,

636
01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:24.492
I gotta take off.

637
01:11:24.526 --> 01:11:28.064
I really wish
you coulda come with me.

638
01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:31.033
Where are you?

639
01:11:31.067 --> 01:11:33.069
I think you're missing out
on so many chances

640
01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:34.937
at something better,

641
01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:37.039
and most of them,
once they're gone,

642
01:11:37.073 --> 01:11:40.676
they don't ever
come back again.

643
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:42.645
Goodbye, Ethan.

644
01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:38.954
Fuck!

645
01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:36.212
So what is it?

646
01:15:40.883 --> 01:15:43.252
That's out there now?

647
01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:47.723
Yeah.

648
01:15:47.756 --> 01:15:50.059
Oh, it's a lot bigger.

649
01:16:08.811 --> 01:16:10.446
So, uh...

650
01:16:10.479 --> 01:16:14.350
do you know
where it is now?

651
01:16:14.383 --> 01:16:16.185
No.

652
01:16:16.218 --> 01:16:21.190
Do you know the people
it's been killing?

653
01:16:24.393 --> 01:16:27.796
Everyone knows everyone
around here.

654
01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:33.469
Hmm...

655
01:16:33.502 --> 01:16:36.272
Where's the lye?

656
01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:38.374
Oh, shit.

657
01:16:38.407 --> 01:16:40.876
Left it in the truck,
hold on.

658
01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:15.811
Hey! You having some trouble?

659
01:17:15.844 --> 01:17:18.514
Oh, um... uh, no, I'm fine.

660
01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.222
What you doing out here?

661
01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.263
Hey! Stop!

662
01:17:39.568 --> 01:17:43.973
Hey! Sheriff's Department!
Stop!

663
01:17:44.006 --> 01:17:45.241
Get down on the ground!

664
01:17:45.274 --> 01:17:46.942
Show me your hands!

665
01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:18.841
You have reached
the voicemail box of...

666
01:18:18.874 --> 01:18:21.076
Uh, Brody Capra.

667
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:23.012
At the tone,
please record...

668
01:18:32.388 --> 01:18:36.358
Mom let me stay home
from school today.

669
01:18:36.392 --> 01:18:37.993
Oh yeah?

670
01:18:38.027 --> 01:18:41.130
Why is that?

671
01:18:41.163 --> 01:18:45.334
I don't know.
Just for fun, I guess.

672
01:18:49.138 --> 01:18:51.507
That's nice.

673
01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.875
Yeah.

674
01:18:58.447 --> 01:19:00.115
What's that?

675
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:04.453
Uh, these are trees.

676
01:19:04.486 --> 01:19:08.857
It looks kinda scary.

677
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.329
What about you?
Are you done?

678
01:19:13.362 --> 01:19:14.496
Mm... okay.

679
01:19:22.037 --> 01:19:23.539
Hey.

680
01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:25.074
Can we talk to you?

681
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.283
So we got some good news,
um,

682
01:19:34.316 --> 01:19:37.052
but it's some big news,

683
01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:40.623
and we wanted
to tell you now.

684
01:19:42.524 --> 01:19:44.259
We've been talking about it
for a long time,

685
01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:48.130
and I've decided,
now that Robin's getting older,

686
01:19:48.163 --> 01:19:50.966
that I wanna go back to school.

687
01:19:53.603 --> 01:19:55.237
Okay.

688
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.272
This past year,
I've been applying to schools

689
01:19:57.306 --> 01:19:59.208
and I got into a few,

690
01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:01.410
and I just accepted one.

691
01:20:04.113 --> 01:20:06.649
Now, the thing is, is...

692
01:20:06.683 --> 01:20:08.417
it's in Maryland.

693
01:20:11.153 --> 01:20:14.923
And since it's
a four-year program,

694
01:20:14.957 --> 01:20:17.059
we're all looking
to move up there.

695
01:20:19.662 --> 01:20:21.530
What are you talking about?

696
01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:26.568
We've been batting around
the idea of moving out of here

697
01:20:26.603 --> 01:20:30.572
for a few years now,

698
01:20:30.607 --> 01:20:33.710
and I think that this is
the right opportunity.

699
01:20:33.743 --> 01:20:36.245
What?

700
01:20:36.278 --> 01:20:37.614
Just to go to school?

701
01:20:37.647 --> 01:20:39.548
Can't you do that here?

702
01:20:39.582 --> 01:20:41.618
It's a good school.

703
01:20:41.651 --> 01:20:43.586
And on top of that,

704
01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.021
we wanna make sure
Robin grows up somewhere

705
01:20:46.054 --> 01:20:51.193
with more opportunities
than we had.

706
01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:53.295
We had a great childhood here.

707
01:20:54.731 --> 01:20:57.734
I just think it's time
for us.

708
01:20:57.767 --> 01:21:00.202
We've gotten everything we can
outta here.

709
01:21:30.767 --> 01:21:32.201
Hello?

710
01:21:32.234 --> 01:21:36.104
Ethan? It's Brody.

711
01:21:36.138 --> 01:21:37.674
What happened to you?

712
01:21:37.707 --> 01:21:39.709
They took me in, the cops,

713
01:21:39.742 --> 01:21:41.443
and they held me overnight.

714
01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:44.246
I just... I want you to know
that they asked

715
01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:45.715
a lot of questions,

716
01:21:45.748 --> 01:21:48.651
but I didn't tell them
anything about, you know,

717
01:21:48.685 --> 01:21:49.652
what we were doing,

718
01:21:49.686 --> 01:21:53.322
or anything about you
or the... or the thing.

719
01:21:53.355 --> 01:21:55.524
Uh, okay, thanks.

720
01:21:55.557 --> 01:21:57.359
I just...

721
01:21:57.392 --> 01:21:58.628
you trust me with this,

722
01:21:58.661 --> 01:22:01.631
and I want you to know
that that means a lot,

723
01:22:01.664 --> 01:22:04.801
to be a part of it.

724
01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:06.669
Okay, look, I gotta go.

725
01:22:06.703 --> 01:22:08.771
I'll call you later.

726
01:22:08.805 --> 01:22:10.673
Oh yeah, okay.

727
01:22:10.707 --> 01:22:14.677
Um, I'll, uh,
I'll talk to you soon.

728
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.474
Hey, this is Shane...

729
01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:55.998
Hey, this is Shane Daunes.

730
01:25:56.032 --> 01:25:57.800
I can't get to the phone
right now,

731
01:25:57.834 --> 01:25:59.802
but if you'll leave
your name and number,

732
01:25:59.836 --> 01:26:01.938
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

733
01:26:01.971 --> 01:26:02.839
Thanks.

734
01:26:07.509 --> 01:26:09.544
You know the worst part about
living in that tiny apartment

735
01:26:09.578 --> 01:26:11.948
after Dad left

736
01:26:11.981 --> 01:26:18.553
was that our old house was
always just up the road.

737
01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:21.624
And every time we'd be
driving back from anywhere,

738
01:26:21.657 --> 01:26:24.994
it felt like
we were going home,

739
01:26:25.027 --> 01:26:28.030
back to that house,

740
01:26:28.064 --> 01:26:32.702
and we'd just keep driving.

741
01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:34.837
And it just sat there
for so long.

742
01:26:34.871 --> 01:26:37.506
It was empty,

743
01:26:37.539 --> 01:26:39.407
and we didn't have like
a real reason to not go back,

744
01:26:39.441 --> 01:26:43.846
we just never did.

745
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.448
Then...

746
01:26:46.481 --> 01:26:48.483
after a few years,
those people moved in

747
01:26:48.517 --> 01:26:51.587
and it felt
a little further away.

748
01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:57.760
Then they left
and more new people moved in.

749
01:26:57.794 --> 01:26:59.394
And all this time,

750
01:26:59.427 --> 01:27:02.497
it's just been
up the road.

751
01:27:07.937 --> 01:27:10.873
You never left, either!

752
01:27:10.907 --> 01:27:14.543
You've always been around
and...

753
01:27:14.576 --> 01:27:19.314
things just never went back
the way they were before, right?

754
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:26.421
And I know you stopped
looking up to me,

755
01:27:26.454 --> 01:27:29.592
at some point.

756
01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:31.761
But for a long time,
I thought,

757
01:27:31.794 --> 01:27:35.497
like, eventually,
we're gonna get older

758
01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:40.402
and things would go back
to how they used to be,

759
01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:45.440
and we'd be close
like we used to be.

760
01:27:48.577 --> 01:27:51.479
Then you met Lynn,

761
01:27:51.513 --> 01:27:58.054
and you pulled
or she pulled you away.

762
01:27:58.087 --> 01:28:01.924
Then you had Robin.

763
01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:03.593
I know they didn't
take you away from me,

764
01:28:03.626 --> 01:28:07.697
but they're just always there.

765
01:28:14.904 --> 01:28:17.006
And that's keeping things
from getting back

766
01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:18.808
to the way they were.

767
01:28:23.779 --> 01:28:25.114
I'm sorry.

768
01:28:31.153 --> 01:28:33.089
But I can't help
but hate them for that.

769
01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:12.828
Hello?

770
01:29:30.713 --> 01:29:31.914
No, I doubt it.

771
01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:40.923
No, no, I think we'll be here
most of the day.

772
01:29:40.957 --> 01:29:43.558
Uh, I mean, it'd be
irresponsible to say this...

773
01:29:54.536 --> 01:29:55.905
Uh, no.

774
01:29:59.108 --> 01:30:00.508
Hey, Jason, we got
some neighbor kids

775
01:30:00.542 --> 01:30:02.278
watching from next door.

776
01:30:02.311 --> 01:30:06.082
You wanna go over there
and see if they saw anything?

777
01:30:06.115 --> 01:30:07.817
Maybe talk to 'em about it?

778
01:30:26.102 --> 01:30:27.703
Mr. Daunes, do you remember

779
01:30:27.737 --> 01:30:30.006
seeing anything suspicious
beforehand,

780
01:30:30.039 --> 01:30:31.539
anything out of the ordinary?

781
01:30:31.573 --> 01:30:32.875
I don't know.

782
01:30:36.212 --> 01:30:39.115
I just went inside
for a minute.

783
01:30:39.148 --> 01:30:41.717
Sir, has anyone
contacted your wife?

784
01:30:41.751 --> 01:30:42.585
No.

785
01:30:42.618 --> 01:30:45.553
I, uh...
she hasn't come home yet.

786
01:31:24.994 --> 01:31:26.328
Hey, Ethan, it's Lynn.

787
01:31:26.362 --> 01:31:28.097
Jesus, you're worse
at answering your phone

788
01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:29.598
than Shane.

789
01:31:29.632 --> 01:31:31.333
Listen, I don't remember
what time we said

790
01:31:31.367 --> 01:31:32.768
for tomorrow night,

791
01:31:32.802 --> 01:31:35.771
but just come around,
like, 6:30.

792
01:31:35.805 --> 01:31:37.840
Oh, also, Shane wanted me
to tell you,

793
01:31:37.873 --> 01:31:39.708
a few more people
are coming now.

794
01:31:39.742 --> 01:31:41.377
I know he said
it'd just be us,

795
01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:43.312
but a few of his work friends
will be here,

796
01:31:43.345 --> 01:31:45.114
and my friend Kristen
and her boyfriend.

797
01:31:45.147 --> 01:31:47.283
- Mom! Look what I made!
- Honey...

798
01:32:50.112 --> 01:32:53.849
So, what are they telling ya?

799
01:32:53.883 --> 01:32:55.784
Nothing.

800
01:32:59.421 --> 01:33:00.789
They found nothing.

801
01:33:00.823 --> 01:33:04.393
They know nothing, they...

802
01:33:04.426 --> 01:33:06.128
they aren't telling me
anything, I mean,

803
01:33:06.162 --> 01:33:08.898
it's almost as if
nothing happened.

804
01:33:12.868 --> 01:33:16.038
And Lynn left.

805
01:33:16.071 --> 01:33:18.274
She blames me.

806
01:33:18.307 --> 01:33:23.379
I was... I was supposed
to be watching her.

807
01:33:23.412 --> 01:33:26.048
You know, I just...

808
01:33:32.454 --> 01:33:35.357
I just keep wishing
that I had, you know,

809
01:33:35.391 --> 01:33:39.929
done something wrong, like,
something to deserve this.

810
01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:41.430
- Come on, man.
- No, I mean, I know

811
01:33:41.463 --> 01:33:45.067
it's horrible to say,

812
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:48.204
but I wish I had something

813
01:33:48.237 --> 01:33:52.474
that I could repent for,
just to give it some meaning.

814
01:33:55.211 --> 01:33:56.478
'Cause I don't know
what to do anymore,

815
01:33:56.512 --> 01:33:58.180
what am I...

816
01:34:00.182 --> 01:34:02.351
All right. Look.

817
01:34:04.787 --> 01:34:06.922
Fuck!

818
01:34:06.956 --> 01:34:08.857
Obviously,
you didn't hear this from me.

819
01:34:10.993 --> 01:34:13.395
Brought a guy in
a couple days ago.

820
01:34:13.429 --> 01:34:14.830
He was parked
on the side of the road

821
01:34:14.863 --> 01:34:16.832
in the middle of the night.

822
01:34:16.865 --> 01:34:19.001
He had a couple bags of lye
and a shovel in his trunk.

823
01:34:19.034 --> 01:34:20.436
Jesus.

824
01:34:20.469 --> 01:34:22.104
Why didn't you tell us?

825
01:34:22.137 --> 01:34:24.373
'Cause he was clean.

826
01:34:24.406 --> 01:34:27.977
He ran,
so we held him overnight.

827
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:31.180
We searched his house,
his property,

828
01:34:31.213 --> 01:34:33.148
but nothing.

829
01:34:33.182 --> 01:34:36.252
- We had to let him go.
- You let him go?

830
01:34:36.285 --> 01:34:37.453
When?

831
01:34:40.823 --> 01:34:41.991
I'm sorry.

832
01:34:44.594 --> 01:34:45.995
Who is he?

833
01:34:49.131 --> 01:34:51.033
Who is he, please?

834
01:34:52.868 --> 01:34:54.303
I don't know.

835
01:34:54.336 --> 01:34:56.972
Some young guy,
he lives alone.

836
01:34:57.006 --> 01:34:58.807
Says he's only been in town
a couple months.

837
01:34:58.841 --> 01:35:00.175
What did I tell you?

838
01:35:00.209 --> 01:35:02.411
Who'd I say we should be
looking at, man?

839
01:35:02.444 --> 01:35:04.146
If you guys let him go,

840
01:35:04.179 --> 01:35:06.148
what makes you think
it's him now?

841
01:35:06.181 --> 01:35:09.518
We had to let him go.

842
01:35:09.551 --> 01:35:11.854
I was there when
he came in that night.

843
01:35:11.887 --> 01:35:14.056
I always thought it was him.

844
01:35:14.089 --> 01:35:15.291
Circumstances withstanding,

845
01:35:15.324 --> 01:35:17.393
that guy had something
clearly to hide.

846
01:35:17.426 --> 01:35:18.927
I can get the truth
out of him.

847
01:35:18.961 --> 01:35:20.496
Well, hold on, what are
we talking about here?

848
01:35:20.529 --> 01:35:22.931
We're done talking, okay?

849
01:35:22.965 --> 01:35:24.601
Give me the address.

850
01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:29.371
We're gonna get some answers
tonight.

851
01:35:39.014 --> 01:35:40.516
What are you gonna do?

852
01:35:44.553 --> 01:35:48.457
I'm gonna make him explain
exactly why he did what he did.

853
01:35:54.163 --> 01:35:56.065
Then we're gonna do
what's right.

854
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:18.954
What you guys
are talking about,

855
01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:22.625
it's... it's not right.

856
01:36:24.661 --> 01:36:26.528
You can't convince me

857
01:36:26.562 --> 01:36:28.197
that he doesn't deserve
everything

858
01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:30.132
that's gonna happen to him.

859
01:36:33.469 --> 01:36:35.437
I need you there tonight.

860
01:36:38.307 --> 01:36:40.409
I need you with me on this.

861
01:37:06.034 --> 01:37:09.104
Hey, uh...

862
01:37:09.138 --> 01:37:13.008
I know this is stupid,
but...

863
01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:14.209
remember when we were kids,

864
01:37:14.243 --> 01:37:18.414
we used to try to catch
snakes and lizards and

865
01:37:18.447 --> 01:37:20.583
stuff like that?

866
01:37:20.617 --> 01:37:24.019
Sometimes, I think about
the time I caught

867
01:37:24.052 --> 01:37:29.291
this really weird snake thing.

868
01:37:29.324 --> 01:37:31.960
We tried looking up
what kind it was

869
01:37:31.994 --> 01:37:36.098
in that snake book
that you used to have,

870
01:37:36.131 --> 01:37:41.570
and, uh, it turns out it was
an Eastern glass lizard

871
01:37:41.604 --> 01:37:44.973
or something.

872
01:37:45.007 --> 01:37:48.477
We didn't know that
at the time,

873
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:51.648
so you thought
that you'd found

874
01:37:51.681 --> 01:37:55.284
this whole new kind of snake.

875
01:37:57.219 --> 01:38:00.456
What are you saying?

876
01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:02.324
I just remember you were, like,
really impressed with it,

877
01:38:02.357 --> 01:38:05.494
like, you thought it was cool.

878
01:38:22.612 --> 01:38:25.280
I just want you to know
that I had

879
01:38:25.314 --> 01:38:29.619
the simplest intentions.

880
01:41:03.606 --> 01:41:05.742
Ethan.

881
01:41:05.775 --> 01:41:07.610
It's time.

882
01:41:52.922 --> 01:41:56.893
You know how people always
say they wish

883
01:41:56.926 --> 01:41:58.828
that they could take
someone's place

884
01:41:58.861 --> 01:42:00.429
when something bad happens?

885
01:42:04.299 --> 01:42:07.269
Like, "I wish it was me
instead of them"?

886
01:42:14.911 --> 01:42:18.014
I guess it's just some way
to show that they care.

887
01:42:21.483 --> 01:42:27.255
But I actually think it's
a lot worse to be the person

888
01:42:27.289 --> 01:42:30.927
watching the ones you love
get hurt...

889
01:42:34.329 --> 01:42:35.732
...wishing it was you.

890
01:42:45.975 --> 01:42:48.711
Take it or leave it.

891
01:43:53.441 --> 01:43:55.645
If anyone else was coming,
they'd be here.

892
01:43:55.678 --> 01:43:57.747
I say it's now or never.

893
01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:15.430
Shane.

894
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:28.911
Can't this all just be over?

895
01:45:53.863 --> 01:45:55.463
Hey!

896
01:45:55.497 --> 01:45:57.233
He's asleep.

897
01:45:57.266 --> 01:45:59.635
I don't think there's
anyone else in the house.

898
01:46:10.713 --> 01:46:11.881
It's locked.

899
01:46:13.883 --> 01:46:15.718
We can get it open.

900
01:46:15.751 --> 01:46:17.853
Maybe there's another door
around back.

901
01:46:17.887 --> 01:46:20.189
Yeah, I think some of the
windows might be unlocked

902
01:46:20.222 --> 01:46:22.224
over on the far side
of the house.

903
01:46:30.266 --> 01:46:35.905
Uh... I...
I think I gotta wait here.

904
01:49:40.089 --> 01:49:41.223
Ethan?

905
01:50:12.154 --> 01:50:13.722
Hey! In here.

906
01:50:19.161 --> 01:50:21.063
Oh, shit. Ethan killed him.

907
01:50:21.096 --> 01:50:22.998
What happened?

908
01:50:23.032 --> 01:50:25.501
Ethan! What happened?

909
01:50:25.534 --> 01:50:27.069
We gotta get him
out of here.

910
01:50:27.102 --> 01:50:28.404
Here, somebody help me
move him.

911
01:50:28.437 --> 01:50:30.773
No, no, no!
Don't touch him!

912
01:50:30.806 --> 01:50:33.175
Everyone just stop!

913
01:50:50.426 --> 01:50:53.095
Is that the last load?

914
01:50:53.128 --> 01:50:54.763
Everything I'm taking.

915
01:52:09.571 --> 01:52:13.375
I'll get the other room
cleaned out tomorrow.

916
01:52:13.409 --> 01:52:15.044
Okay.

917
01:53:16.004 --> 01:53:19.942
It seems the madness
may finally be over.

918
01:53:19.975 --> 01:53:24.313
Local police officer Mark Jones
shot and killed Brody Capra

919
01:53:24.346 --> 01:53:26.683
in a standoff
at Capra's country home

920
01:53:26.716 --> 01:53:28.517
last Wednesday night.

921
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:31.688
While Capra moved to the area
just two months ago,

922
01:53:31.721 --> 01:53:33.956
he is now believed
to be responsible

923
01:53:33.989 --> 01:53:37.259
for the over a dozen
bizarre and violent killings

924
01:53:37.292 --> 01:53:39.061
in the small town...

925
01:54:56.338 --> 01:54:58.073
I know they didn't
take you away from me,

926
01:54:58.106 --> 01:55:01.410
but they're just always there.

927
01:55:01.443 --> 01:55:03.412
And that's keeping things
from getting back

928
01:55:03.445 --> 01:55:06.181
to the way they were.

929
01:55:06.215 --> 01:55:08.718
I'm sorry,

930
01:55:08.751 --> 01:55:12.087
but I can't help but hate them
for that.

931
01:55:13.756 --> 01:55:16.525
I know that I shouldn't,

932
01:55:16.558 --> 01:55:20.329
I know
I shouldn't care so much.

933
01:55:20.362 --> 01:55:24.500
I should have
something else,

934
01:55:24.533 --> 01:55:28.403
something more by now...

935
01:55:28.437 --> 01:55:31.306
but I don't.

936
01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:34.042
I don't know when it happened,

937
01:55:34.076 --> 01:55:35.712
but it feels like
everything's changed

938
01:55:35.745 --> 01:55:37.279
without me,

939
01:55:37.312 --> 01:55:39.281
everyone's gone.

940
01:55:40.583 --> 01:55:43.653
You're the only one
I have left,

941
01:55:43.686 --> 01:55:47.155
and you're not really here
anymore.

942
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:50.526
I just want things back
the way they were,

943
01:55:50.559 --> 01:55:53.596
even just a little bit.

944
01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:58.166
Man, I think I'd give anything
for that.

945
01:56:05.133 --> 01:56:10.133
