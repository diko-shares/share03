00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.860
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire
extended from Arabia to Britain.

2
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.920
But they wanted more.

3
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.590
More land.

4
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
More peoples
loyal and subservient to Rome.

5
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.140
But no people so important
as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.

6
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.610
Thousands died on that field.

7
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.810
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth
day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive

8
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.150
were members of the decimated
but legendary cavalry.

9
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.963
The Romans, impressed by their bravery
and horsemanship, spared their lives.

10
00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:32.243
In exchange, these warriors were
incorporated into the Roman military.

11
00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:36.373
Better they had died that day.

12
00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:55.153
Father.

13
00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.223
They are here.

14
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:04.133
For the second part of the bargain they
struck indebted not only themselves...

15
00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:05.763
The day has come.

16
00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:09.003
...but also their sons,
and their sons, and so on,

17
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.913
to serve the empire as knights.

18
00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:17.513
I was such a son.

19
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:33.833
There is a legend that
fallen knights return as great horses.

20
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.603
He has seen what awaits you,
and he will protect you.

21
00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:40.673
Lancelot! Lancelot!

22
00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:45.286
Lancelot.

23
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.696
Don't be afraid. I will return.

24
00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:21.046
- How long shall we be gone?
- 15 years,

25
00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:25.486
not including the months it'll take
to get to your post.

26
00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:30.066
Lancelot!

27
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.256
Rus!

28
00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:59.586
Our post was Britain -
or at least the southern half,

29
00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:04.689
for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall
built three centuries before us

30
00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.899
to protect the empire from
the native fighters of the north.

31
00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.739
So, as our forefathers had done,

32
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.239
we made our way and reported
to our Roman commander in Britain,

33
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.769
ancestrally named for the first Artorius,

34
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.339
or Arthur.

35
00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.789
Mother, I finished.

36
00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.019
That's beautiful.

37
00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.199
Mother...

38
00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.479
Pelagius. For you.

39
00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:56.739
Well done, Artorius.

40
00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.549
You keep it.

41
00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:02.679
Deliver it to me
when you come to Rome.

42
00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:14.029
Come.

43
00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.509
Behold, Arthur. Young knights.

44
00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.982
If you so choose, they may some day
be yours to lead, as your father before you.

45
00:05:23.052 --> 00:05:25.512
- I'm to be their commander?
- Yes.

46
00:05:25.582 --> 00:05:32.012
But with this title comes a sacred
responsibility to protect, to defend,

47
00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:36.152
to value their lives above your own
and, should they perish in battle,

48
00:05:36.232 --> 00:05:39.632
to live your life gloriously
in honour of their memory.

49
00:05:39.702 --> 00:05:41.362
And what of their free will?

50
00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:45.832
It has always fallen to a few
to sacrifice for the good of many.

51
00:05:45.902 --> 00:05:48.372
The world isn't a perfect place,

52
00:05:48.442 --> 00:05:55.312
but perhaps people like you, Arthur,
and me and them can make it so.

53
00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:38.642
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.

54
00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:43.955
- Our freedom, Bors.
- Mm. I can almost taste it.

55
00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.495
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.

56
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:37.975
Woads!

57
00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:23.237
Rus!

58
00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:31.907
Rus!

59
00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:36.347
Rus.

60
00:11:42.957 --> 00:11:48.457
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.

61
00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:52.527
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

62
00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:54.127
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...

63
00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:57.937
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn't live here.

64
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.830
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?

65
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.770
Pick it up.

66
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.950
Pick it up.

67
00:13:34.143 --> 00:13:36.473
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.

68
00:13:38.343 --> 00:13:40.683
That's not the bishop.

69
00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:45.213
God help us.

70
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:50.213
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.

71
00:13:50.323 --> 00:13:52.153
You're not a Christian, are you?

72
00:13:54.063 --> 00:13:56.433
Does this really work?

73
00:14:05.743 --> 00:14:07.303
Nothing.

74
00:14:07.373 --> 00:14:09.673
Maybe I'm not doin' it right.

75
00:14:16.653 --> 00:14:18.643
Stand down.

76
00:14:24.393 --> 00:14:26.093
Arthur!

77
00:14:26.163 --> 00:14:30.033
Arthur Castus. Your father's image.

78
00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.563
I haven't seen you since childhood.

79
00:14:32.633 --> 00:14:36.093
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain.

80
00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.966
I see your military skills
are still of use to you.

81
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.136
Your device worked.

82
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:45.976
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.

83
00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:55.556
And these are the great Sarmatian knights
we have heard so much of in Rome.

84
00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:03.526
I thought the Woads control
the north of Hadrian's Wall.

85
00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:06.066
They do, but they
occasionally venture south.

86
00:15:06.136 --> 00:15:10.236
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain
has only increased their daring.

87
00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:14.076
- Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.

88
00:15:14.176 --> 00:15:15.906
Men who want their country back.

89
00:15:15.986 --> 00:15:19.046
- Who leads them?
- He's called Merlin.

90
00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:21.386
A dark magician, some say.

91
00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:24.586
Tristan, ride ahead
and make sure the road is clear.

92
00:15:24.656 --> 00:15:29.056
Please do not worry, Bishop.
We will protect you.

93
00:15:29.126 --> 00:15:30.616
Oh.

94
00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:33.666
I've no doubt, Commander.

95
00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.726
No doubt.

96
00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:51.216
Dozens don't worry me
nearly so much as thousands.

97
00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:53.276
Thousands?

98
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.479
I don't like him, that Roman.

99
00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:30.689
If he's here to discharge us,
why doesn't he just give us our papers?

100
00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:33.959
Is this your happy face?

101
00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:36.619
Galahad, do you still
not know the Romans?

102
00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:39.029
They won't scratch their asses
without holding a ceremony.

103
00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:42.259
Why don't you just kill him,
and then discharge yourself after?

104
00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:45.229
I don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.

105
00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:50.029
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.

106
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:54.839
- It's a part of you. It's in your blood.
- No, no, no. No.

107
00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:58.579
As of tomorrow
this was all just a bad memory.

108
00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:00.179
Ohh.

109
00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:05.729
I've often thought about what going home
would mean after all this. What will I do?

110
00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:07.819
It's different for Galahad.

111
00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:11.229
I've been in this life longer than the other.

112
00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:15.989
So much for home.
It's not so clear in my memory.

113
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:20.872
You speak for yourself. It's cold back there
and everyone I know is dead and buried.

114
00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:24.502
Besides, I have, I think, a dozen children.

115
00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:27.382
Eleven.

116
00:17:27.452 --> 00:17:31.892
You listen. When the Romans leave here,
we'll have the run of all this place.

117
00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:35.912
I'll be governor in my own village
and Dagonet will be my personal guard

118
00:17:35.992 --> 00:17:38.962
and royal ass-kisser. Won't you, Dag?

119
00:17:39.032 --> 00:17:42.962
First thing I will do when I get home is
find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.

120
00:17:43.032 --> 00:17:45.092
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?

121
00:17:45.172 --> 00:17:48.072
Why do you think we left in the first place?

122
00:17:53.342 --> 00:17:55.542
What about you, Lancelot?
What are your plans for home?

123
00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:58.912
Well, if this woman of Gawain's
is as beautiful as he claims,

124
00:17:58.982 --> 00:18:01.812
I expect to be spending
a lot of time at Gawain's house.

125
00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:05.122
- His wife will welcome the company.
- I see. And what will I be doing?

126
00:18:05.192 --> 00:18:10.152
Wondering at your good fortune
that all your children look like me.

127
00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:14.222
Is that before or after I hit you with my ax?

128
00:18:23.572 --> 00:18:26.672
Where you been, now? Where you been?

129
00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:30.152
And what will you do, Arthur,
when you return to your beloved Rome?

130
00:18:30.212 --> 00:18:33.112
Give thanks to God that I survived to see it.

131
00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:35.652
You and your god! You disturb me.

132
00:18:35.722 --> 00:18:38.815
I want peace, Lancelot. I've had enough.

133
00:18:39.325 --> 00:18:41.315
- You should visit me.
- Ah!

134
00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:43.925
It's a magnificent place, Rome.

135
00:18:43.995 --> 00:18:47.555
Ordered, civilized, advanced.

136
00:18:47.635 --> 00:18:49.035
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.

137
00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:52.905
The greatest minds in all the lands
have come together in one sacred place

138
00:18:53.005 --> 00:18:54.735
to help make mankind free.

139
00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:00.675
And the women?

140
00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:13.655
Open the gate!

141
00:19:44.795 --> 00:19:46.385
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.

142
00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:48.425
Lancelot.

143
00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:56.968
Bishop, please, my quarters
have been made available to you.

144
00:19:57.078 --> 00:19:59.598
Oh, yes. I must rest.

145
00:20:03.918 --> 00:20:05.708
- Where have you been?
- Oh...

146
00:20:05.778 --> 00:20:09.908
- I've been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!

147
00:20:14.158 --> 00:20:16.058
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.

148
00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:17.558
- You been fighting?
- Yes.

149
00:20:17.628 --> 00:20:18.758
- You been winning?
- Yes.

150
00:20:18.828 --> 00:20:20.818
That's my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!

151
00:20:29.008 --> 00:20:32.268
Let us not forget that
we are the fortunate ones.

152
00:20:32.338 --> 00:20:37.208
Let us raise our wine to those gallant
and extraordinary men we have lost,

153
00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:41.008
but who will be remembered for eternity.

154
00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:44.818
To freedom.

155
00:20:59.338 --> 00:21:01.328
Pelagius.

156
00:21:02.808 --> 00:21:06.238
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.

157
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:09.298
But, of course, it is to be expected.

158
00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:20.831
Sir, I'm here to escort you
to the fortress hall.

159
00:21:27.901 --> 00:21:32.001
When my master meets with your knights,
he must be seated last

160
00:21:32.071 --> 00:21:35.041
and he must be seated
at the head of the table.

161
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:39.241
Your master can plonk his holy ass
wherever he chooses.

162
00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:46.751
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.

163
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:56.091
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?

164
00:21:57.231 --> 00:22:00.031
Arthur says for men to be men
they must first all be equal.

165
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:02.531
I was given to understand
there would be more of you.

166
00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:06.441
There were. We have been
fighting here for 15 years, Bishop.

167
00:22:06.511 --> 00:22:08.871
Oh, of course.

168
00:22:08.941 --> 00:22:13.471
Arthur and his knights
have served with courage

169
00:22:13.551 --> 00:22:20.181
to maintain the honor of Rome's empire
on this last outpost of our glory.

170
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:24.091
Rome is most indebted
to you noble knights.

171
00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:27.281
To your final days
as servants to the empire.

172
00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:29.851
Day. Not days.

173
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:35.104
The Pope's taken
a personal interest in you.

174
00:22:35.174 --> 00:22:37.694
He inquires after each of you,

175
00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:44.114
and is curious to know if your knights have
converted to the word of Our Savior or...?

176
00:22:44.184 --> 00:22:48.484
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
I have never questioned that.

177
00:22:48.554 --> 00:22:50.524
Of course, of course.

178
00:22:50.584 --> 00:22:52.914
They are pagans. Hm?

179
00:22:54.794 --> 00:22:58.314
For our part, the Church
has deemed such beliefs innocence,

180
00:22:58.394 --> 00:23:02.294
but you, Arthur,
your path to God is through Pelagius?

181
00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:05.964
- I saw his image in your room.
- He took my father's place for me.

182
00:23:06.034 --> 00:23:09.764
His teachings on free will and equality
have been a great influence.

183
00:23:09.844 --> 00:23:12.504
I look forward to our reunion in Rome.

184
00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:14.044
Ah.

185
00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:17.774
Rome awaits your arrival
with great anticipation.

186
00:23:17.844 --> 00:23:19.614
You are a hero.

187
00:23:19.684 --> 00:23:23.644
In Rome, you will live out your days
in honor and wealth.

188
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:27.454
Alas...

189
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:32.264
Alas, we are all but players
in an ever-changing world.

190
00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:37.134
Barbarians from every corner
are almost at Rome's door.

191
00:23:37.204 --> 00:23:42.764
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father
have decided to remove ourselves

192
00:23:42.844 --> 00:23:47.034
from indefensible outposts,
such as Britain.

193
00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:50.444
What will become of Britain
is not our concern anymore.

194
00:23:50.514 --> 00:23:53.484
I suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.

195
00:23:53.554 --> 00:23:55.747
- Saxons?
- Yes.

196
00:23:55.817 --> 00:24:00.087
In the north a massive
Saxon incursion has begun.

197
00:24:00.157 --> 00:24:04.527
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- And only kill everything.

198
00:24:04.597 --> 00:24:08.797
So you would just
leave the land to the Woads.

199
00:24:08.867 --> 00:24:10.697
And I risked my life for nothing.

200
00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:12.067
Hm.

201
00:24:12.137 --> 00:24:14.067
Gentlemen,

202
00:24:14.137 --> 00:24:18.767
your discharge papers with safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

203
00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:22.677
But first, I must have a word
with your commander.

204
00:24:27.057 --> 00:24:29.847
- In private.
- We have no secrets.

205
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:40.697
Come. Let's leave Roman business
to Romans.

206
00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:46.667
Let it go, Bors.

207
00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:58.717
Rome has issued a final order
for you and your men.

208
00:24:58.787 --> 00:25:00.242
Final order?

209
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:05.000
You are to travel north
to rescue the family of Marius Honorius

210
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.140
and return, in particular,
with Marius's son, Alecto.

211
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.513
Alecto is the Pope's
favorite godchild and pupil.

212
00:25:16.923 --> 00:25:22.023
It is his destiny to become a bishop,
perhaps even pope one day.

213
00:25:22.093 --> 00:25:25.463
On this day you ask this of my men.

214
00:25:26.003 --> 00:25:28.063
On this day.

215
00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:38.243
They have risked their lives for 15 years
for a cause not of their own.

216
00:25:38.313 --> 00:25:42.843
And now, on the day they are to be
liberated, you send them on a mission

217
00:25:42.923 --> 00:25:46.043
which is far more dangerous
than any other they have undertaken.

218
00:25:46.123 --> 00:25:48.923
You tell me, Bishop,
how do I go to my men and tell them

219
00:25:48.993 --> 00:25:51.893
that instead of freedom I offer death?

220
00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:56.593
If your men are truly the knights
of legend, perhaps some will survive.

221
00:25:56.663 --> 00:25:58.653
If it is God's will.

222
00:25:58.733 --> 00:26:00.763
Your men want to go home,

223
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:05.793
and to get home they need to cross
the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.

224
00:26:06.373 --> 00:26:10.603
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.

225
00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:13.303
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?

226
00:26:13.383 --> 00:26:15.543
Rome? God himself?

227
00:26:15.613 --> 00:26:17.783
Everything I've done has been
for the Church and for Rome.

228
00:26:17.883 --> 00:26:20.683
Do not mistake a loyal soldier
for a fool, Germanius.

229
00:26:20.753 --> 00:26:24.713
Would you leave a defenseless
Roman boy, destined to lead our Church,

230
00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:27.123
at the hands of the Saxons?

231
00:26:28.293 --> 00:26:33.163
Fulfill this mission, and your men
will receive their discharge.

232
00:26:33.703 --> 00:26:38.646
Their papers will be waiting here
the moment they return.

233
00:26:38.706 --> 00:26:40.266
You have my word.

234
00:26:41.746 --> 00:26:46.276
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,
for I will hold you to it.

235
00:26:47.786 --> 00:26:51.446
Break it, and no Roman legion,

236
00:26:52.686 --> 00:26:54.686
papal army,

237
00:26:56.256 --> 00:26:58.656
nor God himself will protect you.

238
00:26:59.426 --> 00:27:01.326
That is my word.

239
00:27:09.576 --> 00:27:14.206
- She gave me fleas.
- You better hope they're fleas.

240
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:19.546
Best of three.

241
00:27:24.286 --> 00:27:26.056
Who wants another drink?

242
00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:30.786
When you gonna leave Bors
and come home with me?

243
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:33.456
My lover is watching you.

244
00:27:44.776 --> 00:27:47.406
You look nothing like him.

245
00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:49.136
You're all Bors.

246
00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:56.289
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?

247
00:27:56.959 --> 00:27:58.589
I aim for the middle.

248
00:27:58.889 --> 00:28:00.989
Oh, they want more!

249
00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:04.729
- Here. Be a mother to your son.
- Oh, come here.

250
00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:09.529
Dagonet, where you been?
We've got plans to make.

251
00:28:09.969 --> 00:28:11.869
Here, please. Sing.

252
00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:13.339
- No.
- Just a last one.

253
00:28:13.409 --> 00:28:16.399
- No, I'm trying to work.
- Come sing. Shut up!

254
00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:19.139
Vanora will sing.

255
00:28:19.209 --> 00:28:22.079
- No, no.
- Sing! Sing!

256
00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:26.749
- Sing about home.
- Don't drop the baby.

257
00:28:29.359 --> 00:28:33.489
♪ Land of bear and land of eagle

258
00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:37.899
♪ Land that gave us birth and blessing

259
00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:42.129
♪ Land that called us ever homewards

260
00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:46.299
♪ We will go home across the mountains

261
00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:50.499
♪ We will go home
♪ We will go home

262
00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:54.979
♪ We will go home across the mountains

263
00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:59.039
♪ We will go home singing our song...

264
00:29:17.342 --> 00:29:21.372
♪...hear our singing, hear our longing

265
00:29:21.442 --> 00:29:25.902
♪ We will go home across the mountains

266
00:29:25.982 --> 00:29:30.542
♪ We will go home
♪ We will go home...

267
00:29:36.392 --> 00:29:38.052
Arthur!

268
00:29:38.262 --> 00:29:40.522
Arthur!

269
00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:46.262
Arthur! You're not
completely Roman yet, right?

270
00:29:46.332 --> 00:29:48.532
Rus!

271
00:29:52.512 --> 00:29:54.772
Knights...

272
00:29:54.842 --> 00:29:57.182
brothers in arms...

273
00:29:57.252 --> 00:29:59.342
your courage has been tested
beyond all limits.

274
00:29:59.412 --> 00:30:00.682
Yes.

275
00:30:00.782 --> 00:30:03.082
But I must ask you now for one further trial.

276
00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:04.912
Drink.

277
00:30:04.992 --> 00:30:11.222
We must leave on a final mission for Rome
before our freedom can be granted.

278
00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:18.662
Above the wall, far in the north,
there is a Roman family in need of rescue.

279
00:30:18.732 --> 00:30:20.932
They are trapped by Saxons.

280
00:30:21.002 --> 00:30:23.302
Our orders are to secure their safety.

281
00:30:23.372 --> 00:30:25.902
Let the Romans take care of their own.

282
00:30:25.972 --> 00:30:28.642
Above the wall is Woad territory.

283
00:30:29.282 --> 00:30:34.275
Our duty to Rome,
if it was ever a duty, is done.

284
00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.285
Our pact with Rome is done.

285
00:30:37.355 --> 00:30:42.265
Every knight here
has laid his life on the line for you.

286
00:30:42.325 --> 00:30:43.925
For you.

287
00:30:44.035 --> 00:30:47.095
And instead of freedom
you want more blood?

288
00:30:47.165 --> 00:30:49.465
Our blood?

289
00:30:49.535 --> 00:30:51.805
You think more of Roman blood
than you do of ours?

290
00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:53.665
Bors! These are our orders.

291
00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:57.765
We leave at first light, and when we return
your freedom will be waiting for you.

292
00:30:57.845 --> 00:30:59.405
A freedom we can embrace with honor.

293
00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:01.635
I am a free man!

294
00:31:01.715 --> 00:31:03.775
I will choose my own fate!

295
00:31:03.855 --> 00:31:06.585
Yeah, yeah.
We're all going to die someday.

296
00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:10.055
If it's a death from a Saxon hand
that frightens you, stay home.

297
00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:12.215
Listen, if you're so eager to die,
you can die right now!

298
00:31:12.325 --> 00:31:14.385
- Enough. Enough!
- I've got something to live for!

299
00:31:14.465 --> 00:31:17.325
The Romans have broken their word.

300
00:31:17.395 --> 00:31:21.065
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.

301
00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:23.095
I'll prepare.

302
00:31:24.235 --> 00:31:26.205
Bors?

303
00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:28.505
- You coming?
- Of course I'm coming!

304
00:31:28.575 --> 00:31:31.775
Can't let you go on your own!
You'll all get killed!

305
00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:35.485
I'm just saying what you're all thinking!

306
00:31:36.815 --> 00:31:38.845
Vanora'll kill me.

307
00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:43.045
And you, Gawain?

308
00:31:47.465 --> 00:31:49.455
I'm with you.

309
00:31:51.235 --> 00:31:53.828
Galahad as well.

310
00:32:28.768 --> 00:32:32.898
O merciful God,
I have such need of your mercy now.

311
00:32:35.148 --> 00:32:38.408
Not for myself, but for my knights,

312
00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:40.848
for this is truly their hour of need.

313
00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:42.478
Deliver them from the trials ahead,

314
00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:46.848
and I will repay you a thousandfold
with any sacrifice you ask of me.

315
00:32:47.388 --> 00:32:49.448
And if, in your wisdom,

316
00:32:49.528 --> 00:32:53.048
you should determine that that sacrifice
must be my life for theirs,

317
00:32:53.128 --> 00:32:57.328
so they may once again taste the freedom
that has so long been denied to them,

318
00:32:57.398 --> 00:32:59.628
I will gladly make that covenant.

319
00:32:59.698 --> 00:33:03.498
My death will have a purpose.
I ask no more than that.

320
00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:06.668
Why do you always talk to God
and not to me?

321
00:33:06.748 --> 00:33:10.238
Oh, pray to whomever you pray
that we don't cross the Saxons.

322
00:33:10.318 --> 00:33:14.651
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?

323
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:17.351
I don't like anything
that puts a man on his knees.

324
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:20.261
No man fears to kneel
before the god he trusts.

325
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.921
Without faith, without belief in something,
what are we?

326
00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:25.521
To try and get past the Woads
in the north is insanity.

327
00:33:25.601 --> 00:33:28.571
- Them we've fought before.
- Not north of the wall!

328
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:34.201
How many Saxons? Hm?

329
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:36.401
How many?

330
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:41.841
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?

331
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:43.611
These people need our help.

332
00:33:43.681 --> 00:33:46.581
- It is our duty to bring them out.
- I don't care about your charge,

333
00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:50.851
and I don't give a damn about
Romans, Britain or this island.

334
00:33:51.361 --> 00:33:54.261
If you desire to spend eternity in this place,
Arthur, so be it,

335
00:33:54.331 --> 00:33:56.321
but suicide cannot be chosen for another!

336
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.391
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, I choose life!

337
00:33:59.461 --> 00:34:02.191
And freedom for myself and the men!

338
00:34:09.571 --> 00:34:12.981
How many times in battle have we
snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?

339
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:16.381
Outnumbered, outflanked,
yet still we triumph.

340
00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:20.251
With you at my side, we can do so again.

341
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:23.221
Lancelot, we are knights.

342
00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:26.951
What other purpose do we serve
if not for such a cause?

343
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:30.461
Arthur, you fight for a world
that will never exist.

344
00:34:30.561 --> 00:34:32.124
Never.

345
00:34:32.204 --> 00:34:35.064
There will always be a battlefield.

346
00:34:38.674 --> 00:34:40.434
I will die in battle.

347
00:34:40.544 --> 00:34:43.174
Of that I'm certain.

348
00:34:43.244 --> 00:34:46.444
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.

349
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:51.224
But if it be this one,

350
00:34:51.284 --> 00:34:53.684
grant me a favor.

351
00:34:53.754 --> 00:34:56.784
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.

352
00:34:56.864 --> 00:34:58.324
Burn me.

353
00:34:58.394 --> 00:35:02.384
Burn me and cast my ashes
to a strong east wind.

354
00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:49.974
Don't touch their women.

355
00:35:54.617 --> 00:35:57.147
We don't mix with these people.

356
00:36:00.127 --> 00:36:03.787
What kind of offspring
do you think that would yield?

357
00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:05.557
Weak people.

358
00:36:05.627 --> 00:36:07.597
Half people.

359
00:36:09.197 --> 00:36:12.827
I will not have our Saxon blood
watered down by mixing with them.

360
00:36:12.907 --> 00:36:17.567
According to our laws, no man
may deny me the spoils of our conquest!

361
00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:19.697
He speaks the truth, Father.

362
00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:40.597
My lord! O, my lord!

363
00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:42.797
God's thanks, my lord.

364
00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.427
Thank you.

365
00:36:44.607 --> 00:36:46.267
Thank you.

366
00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:51.377
Kill her.

367
00:36:54.447 --> 00:36:57.007
No! No!

368
00:36:57.087 --> 00:36:59.747
Are you challenging me?

369
00:37:01.117 --> 00:37:04.457
If you want to challenge me,
you have to have a sword in your hand.

370
00:37:04.887 --> 00:37:09.627
As long as my heart beats,
I rule and you hold your tongue.

371
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.260
Or I'll cut it out.

372
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.910
To represent the holy court,
my trusted secretary, Horton...

373
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.980
Horton?

374
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.320
...will accompany you on your quest.

375
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.320
Jols, find him a horse.

376
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.900
This way.

377
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.700
Godspeed,
as you fulfill your duty to Rome.

378
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.343
My duty is also to my men.

379
00:38:31.753 --> 00:38:34.083
Then get them home.

380
00:40:25.596 --> 00:40:29.056
We are three days' march from
the Great Wall, if we camp at night.

381
00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:31.436
We won't camp.

382
00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:34.336
The wall - what troops are stationed there?

383
00:40:34.406 --> 00:40:37.036
Light Roman infantry

384
00:40:37.106 --> 00:40:39.806
and possibly Sarmatian knights.

385
00:40:39.876 --> 00:40:41.546
Arthur Castus is their leader.

386
00:40:41.616 --> 00:40:43.916
Arthur? Who is this Arthur?

387
00:40:43.986 --> 00:40:49.116
It is said he has never been defeated
in battle. It is said he is a great warrior.

388
00:40:50.956 --> 00:40:52.896
Why should I trust you?

389
00:40:54.226 --> 00:40:56.456
You're a traitor to your own people.

390
00:40:56.526 --> 00:40:59.966
Tell my father of the Roman estate.

391
00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:02.026
Speak up!

392
00:41:03.036 --> 00:41:05.796
A very high-ranking family live there.

393
00:41:05.876 --> 00:41:08.806
They are of great importance to Rome.

394
00:41:08.876 --> 00:41:13.109
Father, their ransom
could pay for the entire campaign.

395
00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:26.559
I'll attack from the north
with the main army.

396
00:41:26.629 --> 00:41:31.259
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.

397
00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:33.299
Burn every village, kill everybody.

398
00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:40.293
Never leave behind you a man, woman
or child who can ever carry a sword.

399
00:42:17.832 --> 00:42:20.962
Woads. They're tracking us.

400
00:42:21.902 --> 00:42:24.002
Where?

401
00:42:24.072 --> 00:42:25.732
Everywhere.

402
00:43:07.455 --> 00:43:09.015
Get back!

403
00:43:09.225 --> 00:43:11.125
Get back!

404
00:43:25.835 --> 00:43:27.325
This way!

405
00:44:10.758 --> 00:44:12.808
What are you waiting for?

406
00:44:32.178 --> 00:44:33.938
Inish.

407
00:44:34.008 --> 00:44:36.238
Devil ghosts.

408
00:44:36.308 --> 00:44:41.478
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn't want us dead.

409
00:45:24.801 --> 00:45:26.921
- Who are you?
- I am Arthur Castus,

410
00:45:27.001 --> 00:45:30.901
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,
sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.

411
00:45:30.971 --> 00:45:32.991
Open the gate.

412
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:43.401
It is a wonder you have come.

413
00:45:43.481 --> 00:45:47.141
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.

414
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:52.021
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.

415
00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:55.991
Our orders are to evacuate you
immediately.

416
00:45:56.061 --> 00:45:57.961
But that... that is impossible.

417
00:45:58.461 --> 00:46:01.901
- Which is Alecto?
- I am Alecto.

418
00:46:02.871 --> 00:46:05.301
Alecto is my son.

419
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:09.861
And everything we have is here in the land
given to us by the Pope of Rome.

420
00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:15.781
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.
- They're invading from the north.

421
00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:18.781
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have. Us.

422
00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:21.881
- We leave as soon as you're packed.
- I refuse to leave.

423
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:29.724
Go back to work! All of you!

424
00:46:29.794 --> 00:46:32.494
- You heard! Go!
- All right, all right.

425
00:46:33.404 --> 00:46:36.134
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!

426
00:46:36.504 --> 00:46:38.494
Go back!

427
00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:44.604
If I fail to bring you and your son back,
my men can never leave this land.

428
00:46:44.684 --> 00:46:46.344
So you're coming with me

429
00:46:46.414 --> 00:46:51.074
if I have to tie you to my horse and drag
you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.

430
00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:53.284
My lord.

431
00:46:53.354 --> 00:46:55.754
Lady, my knights are hungry.

432
00:46:58.624 --> 00:47:00.454
Go.

433
00:47:04.664 --> 00:47:06.154
Come!

434
00:47:11.774 --> 00:47:14.174
Come. Let us go, hm?

435
00:47:28.724 --> 00:47:32.124
Sir, you're famous.
You're Arthur, aren't you?

436
00:47:32.194 --> 00:47:35.424
I'm Ganis. I'm a good fighter and I'm smart.
I'd serve you proudly.

437
00:47:36.734 --> 00:47:38.664
Are you from Rome?

438
00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:40.724
From hell.

439
00:47:42.134 --> 00:47:45.074
- Sir.
- Who is this man?

440
00:47:45.144 --> 00:47:47.877
He's our village elder.

441
00:47:47.947 --> 00:47:50.347
What is this punishment for?

442
00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:54.047
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.

443
00:47:54.117 --> 00:47:56.917
Most of the food we grow
is sent out by sea to be sold.

444
00:47:56.987 --> 00:47:59.787
He asked that we keep
a little more for ourselves, that's all.

445
00:47:59.857 --> 00:48:02.657
My ass has been snappin' at the grass
I'm so hungry!

446
00:48:02.727 --> 00:48:06.457
You're from Rome. Is it true
that Marius is a spokesman for God

447
00:48:06.527 --> 00:48:08.967
and that it's a sin to defy him?

448
00:48:12.607 --> 00:48:15.127
I tell you now.

449
00:48:15.207 --> 00:48:17.367
Marius is not of God.

450
00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:22.637
And you, all of you,
were free from your first breath!

451
00:48:31.327 --> 00:48:33.087
Help this man.

452
00:48:33.157 --> 00:48:35.647
Help him!

453
00:48:35.727 --> 00:48:39.857
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army
is coming this way.

454
00:48:39.927 --> 00:48:42.867
They will show no mercy, spare no one.

455
00:48:42.937 --> 00:48:45.027
Those of you who are able
should gather your things

456
00:48:45.137 --> 00:48:47.437
and begin to move south
towards Hadrian's Wall.

457
00:48:47.507 --> 00:48:50.067
Those unable shall come with us.

458
00:48:50.137 --> 00:48:52.907
You, serve me now.
Get these people ready.

459
00:48:52.977 --> 00:48:54.907
Right, you heard him.

460
00:48:54.977 --> 00:48:57.707
You go grab enough food and water
for the journey.

461
00:48:57.787 --> 00:48:59.477
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!

462
00:49:05.557 --> 00:49:07.550
Come on, hurry.

463
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.800
They have flanked us to the east.

464
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.840
They're coming from the south,
trying to cut off our escape.

465
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.390
They'll be here before nightfall.

466
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.300
- How many?
- An entire army.

467
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.470
And the only way out is to the south?

468
00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.980
East.

469
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.570
There is a trail heading east
across the mountains.

470
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:33.330
It means we have to cross behind Saxon
lines, but that's the one we should take.

471
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.030
Arthur, who are all these people?

472
00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.090
They're coming with us.

473
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.740
Then we'll never make it.

474
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:56.650
- Come on, get back to work!
- Back to work!

475
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.900
Move.

476
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.040
Move.

477
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.560
Move!

478
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.410
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.

479
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.540
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.

480
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.253
What are you doing?
Stop this!

481
00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:32.793
Arthur, we have no time.

482
00:50:34.433 --> 00:50:37.193
Do you not hear the drums?

483
00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:41.723
Dagonet.

484
00:51:00.693 --> 00:51:03.553
- Key.
- It is locked.

485
00:51:03.623 --> 00:51:05.613
From the inside.

486
00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:23.273
You, you... go.

487
00:51:23.343 --> 00:51:24.833
Move!

488
00:51:30.453 --> 00:51:34.583
- Gawain.
- Exaudi orationem meam.

489
00:51:36.163 --> 00:51:39.463
Exaudi orationem meam.

490
00:51:39.533 --> 00:51:45.733
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis
et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.

491
00:51:47.806 --> 00:51:50.606
Who are these defilers
of the Lord's temple?

492
00:51:50.676 --> 00:51:52.706
Out of the way.

493
00:52:11.426 --> 00:52:13.196
The work of your god.

494
00:52:14.366 --> 00:52:17.526
Is this how he answers your prayers?

495
00:52:17.606 --> 00:52:19.726
See if there's any still alive.

496
00:52:27.376 --> 00:52:30.606
How dare you set foot in this holy place?

497
00:52:34.186 --> 00:52:37.316
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!

498
00:52:38.796 --> 00:52:42.156
- This one's dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.

499
00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:45.456
And you.
You even move, you join him.

500
00:52:51.906 --> 00:52:53.206
Arthur!

501
00:52:57.706 --> 00:52:59.506
You must not fear me.

502
00:53:22.839 --> 00:53:25.359
Water! Give me some water!

503
00:53:55.409 --> 00:53:57.399
His arm is broken.

504
00:53:58.679 --> 00:54:00.729
And his family?

505
00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:05.069
She's a Woad.

506
00:54:07.279 --> 00:54:09.379
I'm a Roman officer.

507
00:54:10.219 --> 00:54:12.279
You're safe now.

508
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:17.079
- You're safe.
- Stop what you are doing!

509
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:19.159
What is this madness?

510
00:54:19.259 --> 00:54:22.159
- They're all pagans here!
- So are we.

511
00:54:22.229 --> 00:54:25.069
They refuse to do the task
God has set for them!

512
00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:26.832
They must die as an example!

513
00:54:26.902 --> 00:54:30.342
You mean they refused to be your serfs!

514
00:54:30.412 --> 00:54:32.172
You are a Roman.

515
00:54:32.282 --> 00:54:33.902
You understand.

516
00:54:33.982 --> 00:54:35.972
And you are a Christian.

517
00:54:36.052 --> 00:54:38.412
You! You kept her alive!

518
00:54:42.652 --> 00:54:45.142
- My lord!
- No! No, stop!

519
00:54:47.092 --> 00:54:51.052
When we get to the wall
you will be punished for this heresy.

520
00:54:51.132 --> 00:54:54.862
Perhaps I should kill you now
and seal my fate.

521
00:54:54.932 --> 00:54:58.032
I was willing to die with them.

522
00:54:58.102 --> 00:55:01.402
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.

523
00:55:01.472 --> 00:55:04.912
It is God's wish
that these sinners be sacrificed.

524
00:55:04.972 --> 00:55:07.602
Only then can their souls be saved.

525
00:55:08.212 --> 00:55:11.272
Then I shall grant his wish.

526
00:55:12.882 --> 00:55:15.822
- Wall them back up.
- Arthur.

527
00:55:16.252 --> 00:55:17.742
I said wall them up!

528
00:55:17.822 --> 00:55:21.722
Don't you see it is the will of God
that these sinners be sacrificed?

529
00:55:21.792 --> 00:55:26.592
- Unhand me, defil... They're sinners!
- Get in there!

530
00:56:04.505 --> 00:56:06.475
We're moving too slow.

531
00:56:06.545 --> 00:56:08.975
The girl's not gonna make it,
and neither is the boy.

532
00:56:09.045 --> 00:56:12.305
The family we can protect, but we're
wasting our time with all these people.

533
00:56:12.385 --> 00:56:14.375
We're not leaving them.

534
00:56:14.985 --> 00:56:17.505
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.

535
00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:20.075
Then save your anger for them.

536
00:56:21.285 --> 00:56:25.085
Is this Rome's quest or Arthur's?

537
00:56:51.155 --> 00:56:53.125
- Arthur.
- How is he?

538
00:56:54.085 --> 00:56:55.575
He burns.

539
00:56:57.055 --> 00:56:58.785
Brave boy.

540
00:57:36.638 --> 00:57:39.758
Some of your fingers are out of place.

541
00:57:39.838 --> 00:57:41.738
I have to push them back.

542
00:57:44.208 --> 00:57:48.908
If I don't do this, there's a chance
you may never use them again.

543
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.331
They tortured me.

544
00:58:24.904 --> 00:58:27.064
With machines.

545
00:58:32.984 --> 00:58:38.444
To make me tell them things that...
that I didn't know to begin with.

546
00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.874
And then...

547
00:58:46.324 --> 00:58:48.814
I heard your voice in the dark.

548
00:58:53.264 --> 00:58:55.994
I am Guinevere.

549
00:58:57.134 --> 00:58:59.364
You are Arthur...

550
00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:03.574
of the Knights from the Great Wall.

551
00:59:04.214 --> 00:59:05.944
I am.

552
00:59:06.714 --> 00:59:10.154
The famous Briton
who kills his own people.

553
00:59:35.504 --> 00:59:39.344
I found tracks coming from the south,
but none going back.

554
00:59:39.414 --> 00:59:42.474
Horsemen traveling light and fast.

555
00:59:42.554 --> 00:59:44.487
Could be Roman cavalry.

556
00:59:44.557 --> 00:59:46.047
Could be knights.

557
00:59:48.557 --> 00:59:50.687
They know we're after them.

558
00:59:51.727 --> 00:59:54.627
They'll head east now,
through the mountains.

559
00:59:54.697 --> 00:59:59.397
God's holy work has been defiled.
I am a servant of God!

560
00:59:59.467 --> 01:00:02.167
No, please, I...

561
01:00:03.377 --> 01:00:07.537
He says they walled him up in a building
and took the family.

562
01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:11.807
Someone who goes
by the name of Artorius.

563
01:00:11.877 --> 01:00:13.547
It's him.

564
01:00:13.617 --> 01:00:16.177
It's Arthur.

565
01:00:16.257 --> 01:00:18.917
Take your men east. Hunt them down.

566
01:00:19.627 --> 01:00:23.687
I'll take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.

567
01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:27.427
- And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.

568
01:00:27.497 --> 01:00:29.687
I am a servant of God!

569
01:00:29.767 --> 01:00:33.027
Please, I... I am a servant of God!

570
01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:37.667
Unhand me, you defiler!

571
01:00:41.407 --> 01:00:42.397
Burn it all.

572
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.430
My father told me great tales of you.

573
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.020
Really?

574
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.090
And what did you hear?

575
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.230
Fairy tales.

576
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:44.140
The kind you hear about people so brave,
so selfless, that they can't be real.

577
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.470
Arthur and his knights.

578
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:49.610
A leader both Briton and Roman.

579
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.150
And yet you chose your allegiance
to Rome.

580
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.020
To those who take
what does not belong to them.

581
01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:01.360
That same Rome that took your men
from their homeland.

582
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:05.990
Listen, lady, do not pretend
you know anything about me or my men.

583
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.560
How many Britons have you killed?

584
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.430
As many as tried to kill me. It's the natural
state of any man to want to live.

585
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:16.410
Animals live! It's a natural state of any man
to want to live free in their own country.

586
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:23.243
I belong to this land.

587
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.723
Where do you belong, Arthur?

588
01:02:31.763 --> 01:02:33.093
How's your hand?

589
01:02:35.993 --> 01:02:38.663
I'll live, I promise you.

590
01:02:43.743 --> 01:02:47.933
Is there nothing about my land
that appeals to your heart?

591
01:02:48.013 --> 01:02:50.373
Your own father married a Briton.

592
01:02:50.443 --> 01:02:53.673
Even he must have found something
to his liking.

593
01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:33.043
We'll sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.

594
01:03:33.123 --> 01:03:36.653
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again? Yeah.

595
01:03:48.806 --> 01:03:51.676
'Tis a beautiful country, is it not?

596
01:03:53.546 --> 01:03:55.276
If you say so.

597
01:03:56.246 --> 01:03:59.646
And where do you come from
that compares?

598
01:04:00.486 --> 01:04:02.646
The Black Sea?

599
01:04:04.926 --> 01:04:07.556
This is heaven for me.

600
01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:12.896
I don't believe in heaven.
I've been living in this hell.

601
01:04:12.966 --> 01:04:17.406
But if you represent what heaven is,
then take me there.

602
01:04:28.776 --> 01:04:30.776
Rain and snow at once.

603
01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.406
A bad omen.

604
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:14.219
It is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.

605
01:06:08.979 --> 01:06:13.579
What was it like, your home?

606
01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:21.259
We sacrificed goats, drank their blood,
danced naked round fires.

607
01:06:37.482 --> 01:06:39.642
What I do remember...

608
01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.112
Home...

609
01:06:45.592 --> 01:06:52.082
Oceans of grass from horizon to horizon,
further than you can ride.

610
01:06:52.462 --> 01:06:55.432
The sky, bigger than you can imagine.

611
01:06:59.372 --> 01:07:00.862
No boundaries.

612
01:07:02.202 --> 01:07:04.642
Some people would call that freedom.

613
01:07:06.012 --> 01:07:10.342
That's what we fight for -
our land, our people.

614
01:07:12.952 --> 01:07:15.852
The right to choose our own destiny.

615
01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:20.852
So you see, Lancelot,
we are much alike, you and I.

616
01:07:26.862 --> 01:07:33.962
And when you return home,
will you take a wife, have sons?

617
01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:37.732
I have killed too many sons.

618
01:07:38.812 --> 01:07:40.802
What right do I have to my own?

619
01:07:41.645 --> 01:07:43.375
No family, no religion.

620
01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:49.045
Do you believe in anything at all?

621
01:07:55.895 --> 01:07:59.165
I would have left you
and the boy there to die.

622
01:09:11.638 --> 01:09:13.198
You betrayed me.

623
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:15.408
He means you no harm.

624
01:09:15.478 --> 01:09:19.178
Peace between us this night,
Arthur Castus.

625
01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:27.578
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.

626
01:09:27.658 --> 01:09:31.958
The world we have known
and fought for is ended.

627
01:09:32.028 --> 01:09:33.898
Now we must make a new world.

628
01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:37.028
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
I shall be in Rome.

629
01:09:37.098 --> 01:09:39.498
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.

630
01:09:39.568 --> 01:09:42.128
My knights trust me
not to betray them to their enemy.

631
01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:45.698
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.

632
01:09:45.778 --> 01:09:47.638
We have no fight between us now.

633
01:09:47.708 --> 01:09:50.038
You tell that to the knights
you killed before my eyes,

634
01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:51.738
whose bones are buried in this earth.

635
01:09:51.818 --> 01:09:53.248
We have all lost brothers.

636
01:09:53.348 --> 01:09:56.318
You know nothing of the loss I speak!

637
01:09:56.388 --> 01:09:58.248
Shall I help you remember?

638
01:09:58.318 --> 01:10:02.348
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.

639
01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:08.968
Mother!

640
01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:11.028
Artorius!

641
01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.608
Mother!

642
01:10:19.838 --> 01:10:21.841
Mother!

643
01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:29.181
I ran to the burial mound
of my father to free her.

644
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:36.291
To kill you.

645
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:41.661
Father, please let loose your sword.

646
01:10:59.621 --> 01:11:03.021
I feel the heat of that fire
on my face even now.

647
01:11:03.721 --> 01:11:05.311
I did not wish her dead.

648
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:09.451
She was of our blood, as are you.

649
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:15.021
If you were so determined to leave us
to slaughter, why did you save so many?

650
01:11:22.341 --> 01:11:26.241
My men are strong,
but they have need of a true leader.

651
01:11:26.311 --> 01:11:28.581
They believe you can do anything.

652
01:11:29.211 --> 01:11:32.051
To defeat the Saxon
we need a master of war.

653
01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:35.641
Why do you think
I spared you in the forest?

654
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:42.864
That sword you carry is made of iron
from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.

655
01:11:42.934 --> 01:11:47.234
It was love of your mother
that freed the sword, not hatred of me.

656
01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:50.294
Love, Arthur.

657
01:11:51.344 --> 01:11:54.774
- It is your destiny.
- There is no destiny.

658
01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.934
There is only free will.

659
01:11:57.384 --> 01:12:01.044
And what of the free will of your knights?

660
01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:03.274
Did they die in vain?

661
01:12:22.634 --> 01:12:24.474
Seize him!

662
01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.934
No!

663
01:12:32.844 --> 01:12:34.844
No...

664
01:12:45.664 --> 01:12:47.824
I have the boy!

665
01:12:52.564 --> 01:12:55.474
- Kill him!
- No, don't! Let him go!

666
01:12:56.074 --> 01:12:57.304
Kill him now!

667
01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:09.307
Down!

668
01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:15.527
Your hands seem to be better.

669
01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:23.397
Artorius!

670
01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.467
Do we have a problem?

671
01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:29.407
Huh?

672
01:13:29.777 --> 01:13:31.767
You have a choice.

673
01:13:31.877 --> 01:13:34.607
You help or you die.

674
01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.247
Put down your weapons.

675
01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:43.647
- Do it now!
- Yeah!

676
01:13:51.067 --> 01:13:53.327
- How many did you kill?
- Four.

677
01:13:53.397 --> 01:13:56.097
Not a bad start to the day!

678
01:13:57.637 --> 01:14:01.097
Armor-piercing.
They're close. We have no time.

679
01:14:01.177 --> 01:14:02.797
You ride ahead.

680
01:14:14.457 --> 01:14:16.787
I'm sorry for your loss.

681
01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:19.287
My father lost his way.

682
01:14:19.357 --> 01:14:24.290
He used to say the Church
is there to help us stay on our path.

683
01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:26.498
It didn't help those he made suffer.

684
01:14:27.472 --> 01:14:30.392
The path he chose was beyond the reach
of the church, Alecto.

685
01:14:30.552 --> 01:14:33.557
But not of rome. What my father believed,
so Rome believes.

686
01:14:34.072 --> 01:14:37.302
What, that some men are born
to be slaves? No, that isn't true.

687
01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.402
It is so! He told me so.

688
01:14:40.482 --> 01:14:42.912
Pelagius, a man as close to me as any,
is there now,

689
01:14:42.982 --> 01:14:45.882
teaching that all men are free, equal.

690
01:14:45.952 --> 01:14:49.412
And that each of us has the right
to choose his own destiny.

691
01:14:49.482 --> 01:14:51.082
Teach? How?

692
01:14:51.152 --> 01:14:54.752
They killed Pelagius a year past.

693
01:14:54.822 --> 01:14:57.762
Germanius and the others
were damned by his teachings.

694
01:14:57.832 --> 01:15:00.245
They had him excommunicated and killed.

695
01:15:01.185 --> 01:15:04.445
The Rome you talk of doesn't exist,

696
01:15:04.525 --> 01:15:06.685
except in your dreams.

697
01:15:33.385 --> 01:15:37.475
- Is there any other way?
- No. We have to cross the ice.

698
01:15:37.555 --> 01:15:42.545
Get them all out of the carriages.
Tell them to spread out.

699
01:16:55.095 --> 01:16:58.465
- Knights...
- Well, I'm tired of running.

700
01:16:59.535 --> 01:17:03.805
And these Saxons are so close behind
my ass is hurtin'.

701
01:17:05.105 --> 01:17:07.735
Never liked
looking over my shoulder anyway.

702
01:17:08.975 --> 01:17:13.415
- Be a pleasure to put an end to this racket.
- And finally get a look at the bastards.

703
01:17:14.885 --> 01:17:17.645
Here. Now.

704
01:17:21.695 --> 01:17:23.485
Jols!

705
01:17:23.565 --> 01:17:25.155
You two, take the horses.

706
01:17:31.705 --> 01:17:33.695
Ganis, I need you
to lead the people.

707
01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:35.565
The main Saxon army is inland,

708
01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:39.365
so if you track the coastline till you're
well south of the wall, you'll be safe.

709
01:17:39.445 --> 01:17:42.605
- But you're seven against 200?
- Eight.

710
01:17:42.675 --> 01:17:44.875
You could use another bow.

711
01:17:47.085 --> 01:17:50.215
- I'd rather stay and fight.
- You'll get your chance soon enough.

712
01:17:50.285 --> 01:17:53.255
This man is now your captain.
You do as he says. Am I understood?

713
01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:56.525
- Yes, sir.
- Go. Go!

714
01:17:56.595 --> 01:17:58.525
Right. Come on, then! Move on!

715
01:17:58.595 --> 01:18:00.995
I am able. I can fight.

716
01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:04.265
No. You must bear witness
to all you have seen.

717
01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:07.935
There's one thing you must do,
and that's get back to Rome.

718
01:18:48.145 --> 01:18:50.165
Hold until I give the command.

719
01:18:51.415 --> 01:18:53.435
You look frightened.

720
01:18:54.715 --> 01:18:57.945
There's a large number
of lonely men out there.

721
01:18:59.325 --> 01:19:02.455
Don't worry, I won't let them rape you.

722
01:19:05.665 --> 01:19:07.325
Archer!

723
01:19:18.905 --> 01:19:22.405
- We're out of range.
- I can see that!

724
01:19:22.475 --> 01:19:25.415
I believe they're waiting for an invitation.
Bors, Tristan.

725
01:19:25.485 --> 01:19:27.775
They're far out of range.

726
01:20:07.355 --> 01:20:10.195
Aim for the wings of the ranks.
Make them cluster.

727
01:20:38.525 --> 01:20:41.685
- Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks! Hold the ranks!

728
01:20:45.395 --> 01:20:48.055
- Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks!

729
01:20:50.265 --> 01:20:53.865
Hold the ranks!
Hold the ranks, or I kill you myself!

730
01:20:58.405 --> 01:21:00.605
It's not gonna break. Back.

731
01:21:00.675 --> 01:21:02.165
Fall back!

732
01:21:02.245 --> 01:21:04.235
Prepare for combat.

733
01:21:12.925 --> 01:21:15.045
- Dag!
- Cover him.

734
01:21:15.525 --> 01:21:18.655
- Archers move! Move!
- Forward!

735
01:21:25.605 --> 01:21:28.505
Move! Move! Kill him!

736
01:21:35.945 --> 01:21:37.975
The ice is breaking!

737
01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:42.905
Kill him!

738
01:21:44.255 --> 01:21:45.185
Dag!

739
01:22:11.745 --> 01:22:13.615
Back! Back!

740
01:22:22.655 --> 01:22:24.625
Dag!

741
01:22:33.565 --> 01:22:35.625
Pull back! Arthur!

742
01:22:44.415 --> 01:22:46.145
Kill him!

743
01:22:56.355 --> 01:22:58.085
Help us!

744
01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:18.845
Stay with me.

745
01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:22.075
Dagonet! Stay with me!

746
01:24:27.885 --> 01:24:29.945
Ah, God!

747
01:24:31.185 --> 01:24:35.595
Christ be praised.
Against all the odds Satan could muster.

748
01:24:35.655 --> 01:24:38.355
Alecto, let me see you.

749
01:24:38.425 --> 01:24:41.265
- Kindly get out of my way!
- You have triumphed!

750
01:24:41.335 --> 01:24:44.195
Young Alecto, let me see you.

751
01:24:44.265 --> 01:24:45.825
You are here.

752
01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:48.435
- Lucan!
- You, boy! Stop!

753
01:25:18.235 --> 01:25:20.865
Our great knights.

754
01:25:20.935 --> 01:25:22.565
You are free now!

755
01:25:22.635 --> 01:25:25.005
Give me the papers. Come, come.

756
01:25:26.245 --> 01:25:31.705
Your papers of safe conduct
throughout the Roman Empire.

757
01:25:33.845 --> 01:25:36.475
Take it, Arthur.

758
01:25:39.485 --> 01:25:41.475
Bishop Germanius.

759
01:25:41.555 --> 01:25:43.715
Friend of my father.

760
01:25:54.675 --> 01:25:56.835
You are free now.

761
01:25:57.675 --> 01:25:59.665
You can go.

762
01:26:07.885 --> 01:26:09.545
Bors.

763
01:26:11.855 --> 01:26:13.285
Bors!

764
01:26:14.155 --> 01:26:15.815
For Dagonet.

765
01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:22.465
This doesn't make him a free man.

766
01:26:22.535 --> 01:26:25.225
He's already a free man.

767
01:26:25.335 --> 01:26:26.825
He's dead!

768
01:26:59.305 --> 01:27:01.795
Goodbye, old friend.

769
01:27:02.505 --> 01:27:04.835
We'll be along soon.

770
01:27:49.715 --> 01:27:51.715
Let's drink.

771
01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:57.015
Get drunk.

772
01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:16.705
A grave with no sword.

773
01:28:18.185 --> 01:28:22.675
It was my father's wish
that if he died on this island,

774
01:28:24.655 --> 01:28:27.215
he would be buried with his knights.

775
01:28:27.285 --> 01:28:29.555
He died in battle?

776
01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:31.755
It's a family tradition.

777
01:28:38.065 --> 01:28:42.595
I can see why you believe
that you have nothing left here.

778
01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:48.265
Except what you and your knights
have done.

779
01:28:48.345 --> 01:28:49.365
You have your deeds.

780
01:28:49.445 --> 01:28:54.105
Deeds in themselves are meaningless
unless they're for some higher purpose.

781
01:28:54.185 --> 01:28:57.345
We have waged a war
to protect a Rome that does not exist.

782
01:28:57.425 --> 01:28:59.655
Is that the deed I am to be judged by?

783
01:28:59.725 --> 01:29:02.455
You stayed and fought
when you didn't have to.

784
01:29:02.525 --> 01:29:06.125
You bloodied evil men
when you could have run.

785
01:29:06.195 --> 01:29:08.895
You did all that for no reason?

786
01:29:12.065 --> 01:29:16.625
Pelagius told me once
there is no worse death

787
01:29:19.275 --> 01:29:21.435
than the end of hope.

788
01:29:23.415 --> 01:29:27.745
You and I are not the polite people
that live in poems.

789
01:29:29.655 --> 01:29:32.985
We are blessed and cursed by our times.

790
01:29:33.055 --> 01:29:35.755
Perhaps the curse is of our own making.

791
01:29:36.925 --> 01:29:39.085
And the blessing.

792
01:29:41.365 --> 01:29:44.095
What are you afraid of, Arthur?

793
01:29:49.835 --> 01:29:52.275
You're like this country -

794
01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:55.965
Britons with a Roman father.

795
01:29:58.115 --> 01:30:00.135
Rome is dead.

796
01:30:01.655 --> 01:30:06.055
This place, this land - your home -

797
01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:10.955
is the last outpost of freedom,
of everything you hold dear.

798
01:30:15.435 --> 01:30:18.265
These are your people.

799
01:30:49.065 --> 01:30:52.325
Father, I have failed.

800
01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:56.235
You've lost the respect of the enemy.

801
01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:06.215
I offer my life for my disgrace.

802
01:31:07.385 --> 01:31:09.045
No.

803
01:31:09.815 --> 01:31:11.805
No, Son.

804
01:31:35.975 --> 01:31:38.245
Raewald.

805
01:31:38.315 --> 01:31:40.758
You're second in charge now.

806
01:31:42.538 --> 01:31:45.298
Yeah. You're like a son to me.

807
01:32:40.158 --> 01:32:42.158
What tomorrow brings...

808
01:32:44.198 --> 01:32:45.858
we cannot know.

809
01:34:04.308 --> 01:34:06.148
Arthur, come to the wall now.

810
01:34:06.378 --> 01:34:09.648
- The Saxons are here.
- Make way! Make way!

811
01:34:50.688 --> 01:34:54.528
Knights, my journey with you
must end here.

812
01:35:00.338 --> 01:35:02.328
May God go with you.

813
01:35:13.048 --> 01:35:16.248
Arthur, this is not Rome's fight.

814
01:35:17.518 --> 01:35:19.548
It is not your fight.

815
01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:23.778
Stand fast!

816
01:35:23.858 --> 01:35:26.828
All these long years we've been together,

817
01:35:26.898 --> 01:35:30.958
the trials we've faced,
the blood we've shed.

818
01:35:31.028 --> 01:35:35.328
What was it all for,
if not for the reward of freedom?

819
01:35:36.338 --> 01:35:40.068
And now when we are so close,
when it is finally within our grasp...

820
01:35:40.138 --> 01:35:41.868
Look at me!

821
01:35:41.948 --> 01:35:45.608
- Does it all count for nothing?
- You ask me that?

822
01:35:45.678 --> 01:35:47.308
You who know me best of all?

823
01:35:50.988 --> 01:35:55.118
Then do not do this.
Only certain death awaits you here.

824
01:35:55.188 --> 01:35:58.418
Arthur, I beg you!
For our friendship's sake, I beg you!

825
01:35:58.498 --> 01:36:00.758
You be my friend now
and do not dissuade me.

826
01:36:00.828 --> 01:36:03.388
Seize the freedom you have earned
and live it for the both of us.

827
01:36:03.468 --> 01:36:06.798
I cannot follow you, Lancelot.

828
01:36:06.868 --> 01:36:10.698
I now know that all the blood I have shed,
all the lives I have taken

829
01:36:10.768 --> 01:36:12.768
have led me to this moment.

830
01:37:08.528 --> 01:37:10.188
Straight ahead!

831
01:37:52.778 --> 01:37:53.938
Artorius!

832
01:37:56.878 --> 01:37:58.398
Rus!

833
01:38:09.758 --> 01:38:13.218
Rus!

834
01:39:24.628 --> 01:39:27.538
The Roman Auxiliary has left the wall.

835
01:39:27.598 --> 01:39:30.868
- And the horsemen?
- Leading a caravan away from the fort.

836
01:39:30.938 --> 01:39:34.878
They're running south...
with their tails between their legs.

837
01:39:34.948 --> 01:39:39.468
- So there will be no resistance.
- A few dozen villagers.

838
01:39:42.448 --> 01:39:45.178
We're going to slaughter your people.

839
01:39:45.258 --> 01:39:47.348
I think you should watch.

840
01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:50.758
Your tree might be a good place.

841
01:39:50.828 --> 01:39:52.848
Up on the hill!

842
01:39:59.668 --> 01:40:01.858
A single knight.

843
01:40:05.278 --> 01:40:10.578
Didn't you just say they were gone?
What is this, a ghost?

844
01:40:10.648 --> 01:40:17.248
One man. A tiny fly
on the back of your... great army.

845
01:40:17.318 --> 01:40:19.308
Who is he?

846
01:40:20.818 --> 01:40:22.718
Arthur.

847
01:40:23.988 --> 01:40:25.988
Arthur.

848
01:40:27.498 --> 01:40:29.088
Arthur.

849
01:41:45.068 --> 01:41:47.508
Arthur.

850
01:41:49.378 --> 01:41:53.378
Wherever I go on this wretched island
I hear your name.

851
01:41:54.558 --> 01:41:58.078
Always half-whispered, as if you were a...

852
01:41:59.888 --> 01:42:01.888
god.

853
01:42:04.668 --> 01:42:09.158
All I see is flesh, blood.

854
01:42:11.868 --> 01:42:15.168
No more god than
the creature you're sitting on.

855
01:42:15.578 --> 01:42:18.308
Speak your terms, Saxon.

856
01:42:18.378 --> 01:42:21.678
The Romans have left you.

857
01:42:21.748 --> 01:42:23.878
Who are you fighting for?

858
01:42:24.918 --> 01:42:29.358
I fight for a cause
beyond Rome's or your understanding.

859
01:42:34.758 --> 01:42:39.928
You come to beg a truce.
You should be on your knees.

860
01:42:41.268 --> 01:42:45.068
I came to see your face, so that I alone
may find you on the battlefield.

861
01:42:45.138 --> 01:42:48.508
And it would be good for you
to mark my face, Saxon,

862
01:42:48.578 --> 01:42:53.878
for the next time you see it, it will be
the last thing you see on this earth.

863
01:43:04.788 --> 01:43:06.658
Ah, finally.

864
01:43:06.728 --> 01:43:08.888
A man worth killing.

865
01:43:19.638 --> 01:43:22.008
Prepare the men for battle.

866
01:43:48.638 --> 01:43:49.798
Whoa. Easy.

867
01:43:49.868 --> 01:43:53.028
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

868
01:44:27.008 --> 01:44:28.908
Hey.

869
01:44:28.978 --> 01:44:30.738
You're free.

870
01:45:58.768 --> 01:46:01.098
He's got a plan, this Roman.

871
01:46:09.008 --> 01:46:11.638
Send what's left of your infantry.

872
01:46:14.278 --> 01:46:17.718
- Do you want to kill my men?
- They're my men!

873
01:46:27.628 --> 01:46:29.618
Battle formation!

874
01:46:30.798 --> 01:46:32.318
No. You stay here with me.

875
01:46:40.608 --> 01:46:45.098
Knights, the gift of freedom
is yours by right.

876
01:46:48.078 --> 01:46:52.918
But the home we seek
resides not in some distant land.

877
01:46:52.988 --> 01:46:57.218
It's in us and in our actions on this day.

878
01:47:00.528 --> 01:47:04.158
If this be our destiny, then so be it.

879
01:47:04.228 --> 01:47:10.428
But let history remember
that as free men we chose to make it so.

880
01:47:13.538 --> 01:47:15.908
Rus!

881
01:48:20.991 --> 01:48:23.321
There! On the hill!

882
01:49:47.111 --> 01:49:49.941
Rus!

883
01:51:35.691 --> 01:51:38.181
The knights are demons.

884
01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:40.311
That is the gate to hell.

885
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:18.811
Raewald.

886
01:53:19.921 --> 01:53:21.721
The left flank.

887
01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:27.231
- You go with him.
- Move out!

888
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:00.791
Shields up!

889
01:56:29.981 --> 01:56:31.741
Pull!

890
02:07:32.394 --> 02:07:35.164
Arthur...

891
02:08:59.114 --> 02:09:01.604
It was my life to be taken!

892
02:09:02.724 --> 02:09:04.714
Not this!

893
02:09:05.694 --> 02:09:07.684
Never this!

894
02:09:29.744 --> 02:09:32.214
My brave knights, I have failed you.

895
02:09:34.554 --> 02:09:37.454
I neither took you off this island,

896
02:09:39.154 --> 02:09:41.314
nor shared your fate.

897
02:10:16.624 --> 02:10:22.294
For 200 years, knights had fought
and died for a land not our own.

898
02:10:22.364 --> 02:10:24.594
But on that day at Badon Hill,

899
02:10:24.664 --> 02:10:29.194
all who fought put our lives
in service of a greater cause.

900
02:10:29.274 --> 02:10:32.204
Freedom.

901
02:11:11.614 --> 02:11:14.104
Arthur. Guinevere.

902
02:11:14.954 --> 02:11:17.284
Our people are one.

903
02:11:18.654 --> 02:11:20.644
As you are.

904
02:11:31.504 --> 02:11:34.164
Now I'm really gonna have
to marry your mother.

905
02:11:34.234 --> 02:11:36.904
Who said I'd have you?

906
02:11:56.724 --> 02:11:58.354
King Arthur!

907
02:11:58.424 --> 02:12:00.864
Hail, Arthur!

908
02:12:07.704 --> 02:12:11.164
Let every man, woman, child
bear witness

909
02:12:11.244 --> 02:12:17.014
that from this day all Britons
will be united in one common cause.

910
02:12:21.384 --> 02:12:24.414
Arthur! Arthur!

911
02:12:35.134 --> 02:12:38.334
Artorius!

912
02:13:06.294 --> 02:13:09.564
And as for the knights
who gave their lives,

913
02:13:09.634 --> 02:13:13.734
their deaths were cause
for neither mourning nor sadness.

914
02:13:13.804 --> 02:13:15.964
For they will live forever,

915
02:13:16.044 --> 02:13:20.974
their names and deeds handed down
from father to son, mother to daughter,

916
02:13:21.044 --> 02:13:25.104
in the legends of
King Arthur and his knights.
