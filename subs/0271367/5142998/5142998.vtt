1
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.367
Do you know fear?

2
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.707
Do you know what it's like to feel
your heart beating so intensely...

3
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.252
...that you can't even breathe?

4
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.546
This is a story...

5
00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:11.800
...of monsters. Creatures.

6
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.136
Hideous nightmares that crawl
in the night.

7
00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:16.638
I've seen them.

8
00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.057
I've seen them in visions.

9
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:23.603
And you will too.

10
00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.190
I know you're saying to yourself.

11
00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:30.985
"What is this brother doing
in this godforsaken place?"

12
00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:34.114
The truth brought me out
to the only place...

13
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.659
...where I can speak the truth
and they can't get me.

14
00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:41.454
That's right. Right here at KFRD,
freedom radio.

15
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:45.333
The source for the inside dope
on conspiracies, aliens...

16
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.962
...and up- To- The- Minute reports
on when they'll invade.

17
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.923
It's morning here
in Prosperity, Arizona...

18
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.718
...and it's time for America
to wake up, people!

19
00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.471
Wake up before it's too late!
But no.

20
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.807
Of course you're still asleep.

21
00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.309
You still think we landed
on the moon...

22
00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:08.356
...that Oswald killed Kennedy, and that
a black man's vote in Florida counts!

23
00:02:08.523 --> 00:02:09.524
Wake up!

24
00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.654
Look to the skies.
Look to the skies, my friends.

25
00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:18.032
Unless you're driving.
I don't want nobody suing.

26
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.787
Got enough government problems.
Can barely pay for this damn trailer.

27
00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:31.963
Keep talking, buddy.
Say something that has caffeine in it.

28
00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:36.509
It's a hard life spreading the truth.
Never made Gandhi rich.

29
00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:40.221
Never made Mother Teresa rich.
L. Ron Hubbard?

30
00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:43.349
Actually, he did pretty good
for himself.

31
00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:17.509
Interesting.

32
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.983
Joshua?

33
00:04:22.323 --> 00:04:23.742
Joshua?

34
00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:48.767
You're a big fella.

35
00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.693
Joshua! You trying
to scare me to death?

36
00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.111
Hello, Mike.

37
00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:05.992
The Lycosa narbonensis looks different
today. It's bigger.

38
00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.120
It's their diet.
I made a discovery.

39
00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:14.042
These have been in the pond
for the past three days.

40
00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.460
Crickets?

41
00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:19.714
They're like...spider steroids.

42
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:24.219
I see dead people.
I see dead people.

43
00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:26.971
He loves that movie. I don't...

44
00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.682
There they go! Look, look!

45
00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:35.480
- He was hungry!
- As they grow, their appetites do too.

46
00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:39.776
I've never seen spiders this big.
It's because of those crickets?

47
00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:42.195
I'm gonna make a fortune.

48
00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:44.155
Jumping spiders!

49
00:05:44.322 --> 00:05:46.783
Yeah, Habronattus orbus.

50
00:05:50.578 --> 00:05:52.497
Look, look how they kill.

51
00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:56.000
I call this an arach- Attack.

52
00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:58.878
- Get it?
- Yeah. It's good.

53
00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.758
Have the orb weavers come in?

54
00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:06.594
T ook me forever to get
that mating pair.

55
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:11.474
I had to bribe every customs agent
from Santiago to Tucson. But here.

56
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:18.273
That is too cool.

57
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.527
See, the male orb weavers compete
for the female's attention.

58
00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:26.740
They all try to give her
the best present. Like bugs...

59
00:06:26.906 --> 00:06:31.077
...or, you know, rats
or the occasional parrot.

60
00:06:32.203 --> 00:06:34.414
Let me show you something.

61
00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:41.212
You see, the prey is cocooned alive
so she can eat them in her nest.

62
00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:44.048
You know how women
like breakfast in bed.

63
00:06:44.215 --> 00:06:45.717
Look at it.

64
00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:48.011
Look at this, look at her.

65
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.098
The female is three times as big
as the male.

66
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.310
Say hello to Consuela.

67
00:06:58.063 --> 00:07:00.774
She fills her prey
with digestive acid...

68
00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:04.527
...to liquefy it so she can
drink it from inside out.

69
00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:06.404
While it's alive.

70
00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:14.662
Man...

71
00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:16.331
...am I in trouble.

72
00:07:16.498 --> 00:07:19.751
I have to go.
I'll call you later, okay?

73
00:07:19.918 --> 00:07:22.962
Next week, I bet they're twice
as big as today.

74
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:25.256
Bye, Josh. See you next week!

75
00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.562
Where did you go, little fella?

76
00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.386
I see dead people!
I see dead...!

77
00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.697
Sorry, sonny. We aren't hiring.

78
00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.492
You sure? I'm a pretty good engineer.

79
00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.703
Do I look like a woman who isn't sure?

80
00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:20.622
Yeah, well...

81
00:09:21.956 --> 00:09:25.418
- I used to know my way around here.
- We aren't hiring.

82
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.131
We're laying off. We're three months
from a going- Out- Of- Business sale.

83
00:09:30.673 --> 00:09:33.718
- Got the picture?
- Yeah, I got the picture.

84
00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:35.804
But my name's not Sonny.

85
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.139
It's Chris.

86
00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:45.897
Chris?

87
00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.026
Aunt Gladys.

88
00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:52.529
Welcome home.

89
00:09:56.157 --> 00:09:58.743
Bad dog! No!

90
00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:13.925
- Pete, what are you doing out here?
- Well, we got a...

91
00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:17.303
No. Question is,
what are you doing out here?

92
00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:21.391
- You were supposed to stay home.
- What did you find, Mom?

93
00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:24.894
Some jerk tossed a barrel of chemicals
off the road.

94
00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:28.148
Looks like it's been out here
a couple of weeks.

95
00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:31.818
Who knows how much contamination
it's caused.

96
00:10:32.026 --> 00:10:34.487
The water is contaminated?

97
00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:38.032
Pete, send a sample down
to the EPA lab in Phoenix.

98
00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:40.493
Let's see what they come up with.

99
00:10:40.702 --> 00:10:44.080
- I have to tell Joshua!
- That's where you were going?

100
00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:48.001
I told you no more visits
to that spider farm, didn't I?

101
00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:52.213
- You're grounded.
- But I have to tell Joshua about this.

102
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.509
I don't want you hanging out with him.
Those spiders are dangerous.

103
00:10:56.676 --> 00:11:00.889
They give you nightmares,
and you keep me up all night.

104
00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:04.309
You know what happens
when I don't get enough sleep, right?

105
00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:05.894
Bad mood?

106
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:08.063
Put your bike in the truck.

107
00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:13.401
- Can you help him with his bike?
- Yeah, okay, sure.

108
00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:36.800
Hang on, Mike.

109
00:11:52.107 --> 00:11:55.151
Party's over, gentlemen.
Off the bikes.

110
00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:57.195
Great, this is all I need.

111
00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:06.704
She is the sexiest sheriff
in the country.

112
00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:08.289
I know, it's weird.

113
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:14.087
- You bought yourself a reckless, Bret.
- Give them a break.

114
00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:16.631
- Get in the truck, Ashley.
- Mom!

115
00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:18.133
Now.

116
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.598
- Give me your license.
- Come on, sheriff.

117
00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:31.312
- Anything you say can be used against...
- Shut up!

118
00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:36.151
You have a right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney...

119
00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:41.656
Larry, do we know anybody at City Hall
who might be able to take care of this?

120
00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.534
Bret, isn't your stepfather the mayor?

121
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.415
Put my daughter in danger again, I'll
show you how little that means to me.

122
00:12:50.582 --> 00:12:52.792
We're cool, sheriff.

123
00:12:54.502 --> 00:12:58.298
- Do you think G- String or underwear?
- Definitely thong.

124
00:12:58.465 --> 00:13:01.050
- You're kidding. Gonna pay for this?
- No.

125
00:13:01.217 --> 00:13:03.303
- Sweet.
- That was really sweet.

126
00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:06.056
- I heard that!
- Whatever.

127
00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:10.810
Bret, I can't believe my mom gave you
a ticket. It was humiliating.

128
00:13:10.977 --> 00:13:14.355
- I need the phone.
- You don't. You have no friends.

129
00:13:15.356 --> 00:13:19.569
I can't get any privacy around here,
you know?

130
00:13:19.736 --> 00:13:21.196
Hello?

131
00:13:27.452 --> 00:13:28.953
My God.

132
00:13:41.049 --> 00:13:44.094
Anybody know what's going on
with the phone?

133
00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:01.820
Come on, Joshua. Pick up!

134
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.543
- How much?
- Lt don't make sense.

135
00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:21.047
Wait. This is a town meeting,
not the WWF.

136
00:14:21.297 --> 00:14:22.382
Mayor?

137
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.219
Why can't those of us
that want to sell, sell?

138
00:14:26.469 --> 00:14:30.390
Viroanol wants all of our properties
or none of them.

139
00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:35.228
Let's face it, the town's going broke.
They'll pay us to relocate.

140
00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:39.566
How do we know this isn't another
one of your get- Rich schemes...

141
00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:42.610
...like building this ridiculous mall
out here?

142
00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:45.572
They scrapped plans to run
a freeway here...

143
00:14:45.864 --> 00:14:50.535
- Or that stupid ostrich farm of yours.
- It's good meat. It's healthy.

144
00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:54.080
Everybody here is having
some financial problems.

145
00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:58.460
I want to get out from under this.
The rest of you should too.

146
00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:01.546
This is a government cover- Up,
isn't it?

147
00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:05.633
- What are you talking about?
- Why they giving so much money?

148
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.719
Just to get to the mines?

149
00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:11.556
They want to put the empty mines
to use. It's safe.

150
00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:15.018
The only reason that we've kept
this town going...

151
00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:19.606
...is the hope the McCormack mines
could turn their selves around...

152
00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:24.152
...and put everybody back to work.
It is not happening.

153
00:15:24.819 --> 00:15:27.947
Old man McCormack, God rest his soul...

154
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.949
...he's dead.

155
00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:34.329
- As dead as those mines.
- Well, Mr. Mayor...

156
00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:36.289
...before he died...

157
00:15:37.082 --> 00:15:39.417
...he claimed he'd seen that vein.

158
00:15:39.584 --> 00:15:42.921
Let's be honest, Leon.
The man was hallucinating.

159
00:15:43.088 --> 00:15:45.799
Those mines are filled
with methane gas.

160
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:49.135
You're gonna load that gun
with toxic waste?

161
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:54.599
- This is for landowners only.
- I am a landowner, Wade.

162
00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:58.686
Chris McCormack!
I didn't know you were back.

163
00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:02.440
My father said he'd found
the Agua Mesa lode. I believe him.

164
00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:05.110
He said a lot of things near the end.

165
00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:09.489
I'm not selling the mine.

166
00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:15.036
Chris! Wait up!

167
00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:19.165
- You're being foolish.
- Back off.

168
00:16:19.374 --> 00:16:21.668
Your father was delusional.

169
00:16:21.876 --> 00:16:25.171
Shut the hell up about my father.
I'm warning you.

170
00:16:25.338 --> 00:16:29.968
Since when did you care about
the mines? You've been gone 10 years.

171
00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.219
Wade...

172
00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:33.471
Don't make the town suffer...

173
00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:37.350
...because you feel guilty you weren't
around when your father died.

174
00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:39.185
I'm talking to you.

175
00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:42.230
I warned you!

176
00:16:42.397 --> 00:16:45.859
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's it!

177
00:16:46.025 --> 00:16:48.528
I'm pressing charges.
I want him arrested.

178
00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:51.406
Go home, Wade.
Put some ice on your nose.

179
00:16:51.573 --> 00:16:57.162
Curve around 20 feet away from
the scene of a misdemeanor. Thank you.

180
00:16:57.328 --> 00:17:00.165
Ten years and you have
not changed a bit.

181
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.921
- Lay low for a couple days, all right?
- Good to see you again, Sam.

182
00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:08.590
Just like old times.

183
00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:11.676
Everything will be sorted out
in the morning.

184
00:17:11.843 --> 00:17:15.597
- So you still like men.
- What are you talking about?

185
00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:20.393
Nothing. I just saw you staring
at his butt when you handcuffed him.

186
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.354
Who said it's okay to talk
to me like this?

187
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:26.691
He's pretty cute for an old- Fogy
kind of guy.

188
00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.236
He just needs a shave.

189
00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:35.700
Okay, folks. Show's over. Move along.

190
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:36.951
Night, Sam.

191
00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:39.412
Nothing to see here, folks.

192
00:17:39.662 --> 00:17:43.041
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

193
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.353
Honey, give it a rest. It's so late.
It's almost midnight.

194
00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:09.275
You told me to finish the job.
I'm trying to actually finish the job.

195
00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:13.154
Let's give Zekie his snack
and go to sleep. Where is Zeke?

196
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:15.156
Well, he's just...

197
00:18:15.323 --> 00:18:18.243
Don't tell me he went
into the dry wall again.

198
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:22.497
I was meaning to get a grille.
They don't have the right size...

199
00:18:23.498 --> 00:18:27.669
You were gonna finish remodeling
this place. Over a month ago.

200
00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:30.713
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

201
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.342
We'll have to give Zeke cat food,
and he hates that.

202
00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:39.347
God forbid a cat should have to eat
cat food. That cat is spoiled rotten.

203
00:18:39.514 --> 00:18:42.600
If he was a kid,
we'd send him to military school.

204
00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:44.352
Poor Zekie.

205
00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:47.397
- Let's lie and say it's tuna.
- Okay.

206
00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:50.442
You won't trick him. He's smart.

207
00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:52.902
Zekie- Doodle.

208
00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:55.280
Look what we got for you.

209
00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:57.866
We got tuna.

210
00:19:01.327 --> 00:19:05.290
Get your furry cat ass out of there!

211
00:19:25.143 --> 00:19:26.144
Zeke.

212
00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:51.044
What's going on?

213
00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:01.388
Oh, my God!

214
00:20:02.514 --> 00:20:04.432
She's divorced now, you know.

215
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:08.061
I don't want to talk
about Sam Parker right now.

216
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:14.109
Man in a flea circus don't wanna itch,
but he still does.

217
00:20:14.734 --> 00:20:17.237
Something on your mind, Gladys?

218
00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:22.909
- I know why you left town 10 years ago.
- I left for a lot of reasons.

219
00:20:23.076 --> 00:20:27.205
You wanted to avoid telling Sam
why you beat up her husband.

220
00:20:27.372 --> 00:20:30.792
That was a long time ago.
I'm a changed man now.

221
00:20:31.584 --> 00:20:32.585
Prove it.

222
00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:36.464
March down to Sam Parker's
and tell her everything.

223
00:20:36.798 --> 00:20:38.925
Why you broke
her husband's nose.

224
00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:42.595
Why you left town without
so much as a fare- Thee- Well.

225
00:20:42.804 --> 00:20:46.683
And tell her once and for all
how you really feel about her.

226
00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:49.936
Lose the face fuzz before you do.

227
00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:53.189
Makes your mouth look like
a stripper's crotch.

228
00:20:56.609 --> 00:20:57.777
That's disgusting.

229
00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:08.788
Hello?
Hey, Pete. What's up?

230
00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:12.292
- Can you talk?
- I can talk. What's the matter?

231
00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:15.295
- Something ate Zeke.
- What?

232
00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:18.923
- He got in the dry wall.
- Something ate your cat?

233
00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:24.220
Oh, my God. What do you think it was?

234
00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:42.489
Unbelievable.

235
00:21:42.697 --> 00:21:46.826
- How is Emma taking it?
- Well, she left me.

236
00:21:46.993 --> 00:21:50.330
- She's gone to stay with her mother.
- I'm so sorry.

237
00:21:51.122 --> 00:21:52.499
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

238
00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:56.461
- You sound like you're crying.
- No, no.

239
00:21:56.628 --> 00:22:00.924
I just...
I have an intolerance to dairy.

240
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:04.177
I'm just a little bit mucousy
right now.

241
00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:05.387
That's it.

242
00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:23.738
Sam, I need to tell you something.

243
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.161
- It's Bret. I'm gonna get it.
- Wait. Hang on a second. Come here.

244
00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:34.207
I'm worried about things
you've been doing lately, Ash.

245
00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:38.753
This bad- Girl thing you're going
through could get you in trouble.

246
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.757
I have something that I want you
to keep with you, okay?

247
00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:47.220
- I really don't want to do this now.
- Just a sec!

248
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:52.183
I'm a man. You're a woman.

249
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.393
What am I doing?

250
00:22:55.562 --> 00:22:59.691
- Take this. Protection.
- Ls that a stun gun? Are you kidding?

251
00:22:59.858 --> 00:23:04.362
- I knew guys like Bret at your age.
- Mom, I'm not you, okay?

252
00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:06.906
I'm not gonna get pregnant at 16.

253
00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:12.287
I'm not gonna stay here for the rest of
my life and be a trailer- Trash sheriff!

254
00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:15.373
Thanks for the flashback.

255
00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:21.880
I didn't deserve that.

256
00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:26.426
I'm sorry, okay?

257
00:23:26.634 --> 00:23:28.428
I'm really sorry.

258
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.310
Can I have the stun gun, please?

259
00:23:39.647 --> 00:23:44.277
- Be careful with it, all right?
- Okay. Thank you.

260
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.613
Get out of here.

261
00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:52.452
Oh, it's you.

262
00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:58.500
- I was wondering if your mom was home?
- Mom! It's for you.

263
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.340
- Morning, Chris.
- Morning, Sam.

264
00:24:06.132 --> 00:24:09.302
I wanted to come by
and apologize for yesterday.

265
00:24:09.511 --> 00:24:12.055
I can handle Wade.
Don't worry about it.

266
00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:13.973
Great.

267
00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:18.019
And since I'm back in town
for a little while...

268
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.523
...I thought maybe I could...

269
00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:23.358
Sam...

270
00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:25.985
...before I left...

271
00:24:27.487 --> 00:24:30.281
Is there something you wanna tell me?

272
00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:34.202
Do you think we could...

273
00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:37.956
...meet somewhere? Hook up?
Not hook up.

274
00:24:38.123 --> 00:24:42.252
I mean, meet somewhere
and catch up on things?

275
00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.380
Sure, Chris. We could do that.

276
00:24:45.547 --> 00:24:49.384
- Great. All right. I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

277
00:24:50.427 --> 00:24:52.679
Who are the flowers for?

278
00:24:53.221 --> 00:24:56.015
Well, they're for you, actually.

279
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.017
I picked them myself.

280
00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:01.396
- Nice.
- Nice.

281
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.022
All right, bye.

282
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.277
Picked them myself.

283
00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:08.695
Come on.

284
00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:39.392
Joshua?

285
00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:52.489
There's no sign of Joshua...

286
00:25:52.655 --> 00:25:54.115
...his parrot...

287
00:25:54.407 --> 00:25:57.118
...or any of the arachnids.

288
00:25:58.453 --> 00:26:03.083
Just these huge, intricate webs
they've left behind.

289
00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:32.404
I've discovered several arachnid
tracks outside.

290
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.616
From my initial estimate,
the spiders have doubled.

291
00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:38.326
No...

292
00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:42.539
...more like they're five times
their original size.

293
00:27:21.995 --> 00:27:24.539
I found this map in my dad's study.

294
00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:29.377
Leon, is this the section he was
working on when he died?

295
00:27:29.544 --> 00:27:30.837
I thought so.

296
00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:35.133
I want to concentrate all our energy
in these tunnels here.

297
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.429
Those mines have the highest
concentration of methane gas.

298
00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:43.391
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
my dad did.

299
00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:46.352
I want all men to wear masks
at all times.

300
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:51.149
If you feel disoriented, get to
a higher chamber as soon as possible.

301
00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:55.445
It's nice to know you didn't forget
everything we taught you.

302
00:28:10.627 --> 00:28:13.713
- Can you give me a ride into town?
- Sure. Hop in.

303
00:28:13.922 --> 00:28:15.381
Great, thanks.

304
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.226
What's that?

305
00:28:26.768 --> 00:28:31.481
I think it's an exoskeleton
of a male orb weaver's pedipalps.

306
00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:33.525
Okay.

307
00:28:33.942 --> 00:28:36.069
It's a spider's leg.

308
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:39.697
That seems awful big
to be a spider leg.

309
00:28:39.864 --> 00:28:43.410
That's the problem.
But nobody's gonna believe me.

310
00:28:44.452 --> 00:28:46.246
Believe what?

311
00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:48.498
Do you really want to know?

312
00:28:48.665 --> 00:28:52.961
- Try me.
- Okay, the situation is this:

313
00:28:53.128 --> 00:28:57.757
My friend Joshua sells spiders.
They've been growing bigger and bigger.

314
00:28:57.966 --> 00:29:02.846
Now they've broken out of their cages
and headed down to the mineshafts.

315
00:29:03.012 --> 00:29:06.766
Joshua is nowhere to be found.
They might've killed him.

316
00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:11.396
But you won't believe me. I'm the kid.
They never believe the kid.

317
00:29:11.813 --> 00:29:13.440
Let me see it.

318
00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:18.278
It does kind of look
like an old piece of cactus.

319
00:29:18.445 --> 00:29:19.904
See?

320
00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:56.209
So...

321
00:30:56.418 --> 00:31:00.213
- ...where were you?
- I went to Joshua's.

322
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.842
- What did I say about that?
- His spiders are gigantic!

323
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.303
The town could be in danger.
They could destroy everything!

324
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.807
People could get killed.
Just hear me out.

325
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:13.893
I swear to God it's the television.

326
00:31:14.102 --> 00:31:16.980
This is exactly your problem,
right here.

327
00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:21.526
I don't want to hear any more
of your media- Induced nightmares.

328
00:31:21.693 --> 00:31:22.986
Mom, listen to me!

329
00:31:23.153 --> 00:31:25.321
Add a week to how long
you're grounded.

330
00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:28.825
- Please.
- And no TV.

331
00:31:38.626 --> 00:31:41.588
I know, I thought it was a slam- Dunk.

332
00:31:41.755 --> 00:31:45.592
Who knew Chris McCormack would
suddenly get gold fever?

333
00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:47.635
I'm trying my best here.

334
00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:50.930
Do you know what people
would do if they knew...

335
00:31:51.097 --> 00:31:54.934
...we were storing toxic waste
without their consent?

336
00:31:55.143 --> 00:31:57.437
Wade, I'm going out now.

337
00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:00.440
Now, look. I let you guys run tests...

338
00:32:00.648 --> 00:32:04.069
...putting that stuff in the mines
under my property.

339
00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:07.405
- I'll be back late.
- You owe me on this.

340
00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:13.119
Going off to get wasted, have an orgy.
Might steal a car, want one?

341
00:32:13.328 --> 00:32:17.624
Bret, I'm on the phone. Go have
some fun. I'll see you later.

342
00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:22.128
- We stand together or we fall together.
- Thanks for caring, man.

343
00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:43.358
I'll do what I can.

344
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:00.834
What the...?

345
00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:15.033
Good Lord.

346
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:51.319
I've been warning you for years,
but you wouldn't listen.

347
00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:55.407
Now it's emerging as a trend
in our sleepy little town.

348
00:34:55.573 --> 00:34:59.077
The police wire says Bob Stuck's
dog Skippy's missing.

349
00:34:59.244 --> 00:35:02.455
It's the fourth missing- Pet call
we've had today.

350
00:35:02.622 --> 00:35:04.499
It's strange. It's strange.

351
00:35:04.666 --> 00:35:09.087
People are saying it's coyotes,
it's wolves. But we know the truth.

352
00:35:09.254 --> 00:35:12.590
We all know about those cows
and the probe.

353
00:35:12.757 --> 00:35:14.259
The anal probe.

354
00:35:15.135 --> 00:35:20.348
Let's talk about the probe. Let's talk
about the anal probe. What is that?

355
00:35:20.515 --> 00:35:23.601
What are they looking for?
That's just wrong.

356
00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:28.314
Skippy didn't do anything to anybody.
He doesn't deserve that!

357
00:35:28.523 --> 00:35:31.985
What will you find in a dog's...?
It's just wrong!

358
00:35:32.193 --> 00:35:34.654
You're all ostriches with
your heads in the dirt.

359
00:35:35.155 --> 00:35:37.824
Which just leaves your ass
up in the air!

360
00:35:37.991 --> 00:35:43.204
You're inviting the aliens in! They
have no choice but to probe your butt.

361
00:35:44.706 --> 00:35:48.460
Aunt Gladys, how can you listen
to this wacko?

362
00:35:48.626 --> 00:35:50.962
I think he's very informative.

363
00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:58.094
Do Floyd and Leroy still
have that barbershop?

364
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:00.513
Good idea. People are talking.

365
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.184
You can't light those matches?

366
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.394
Maybe it's a sign to quit.

367
00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:09.397
If the aliens come
and try to anal- Probe me...

368
00:36:09.564 --> 00:36:12.400
...I'm telling you,
I'm not taking that!

369
00:36:13.568 --> 00:36:16.154
If you want a piece of me,
don't take that piece!

370
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:18.948
So how much is a shave these days?

371
00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:21.826
- Four bucks.
- Four bucks?

372
00:36:21.993 --> 00:36:25.121
- It's a good deal.
- Got to give a good deal.

373
00:36:25.288 --> 00:36:30.293
Can't charge around here what
a barber can charge in other places...

374
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.087
...where they got money.

375
00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:35.048
And jobs.

376
00:36:37.008 --> 00:36:41.930
Of course, some people don't know
a good deal when they see one.

377
00:36:42.097 --> 00:36:45.558
- Maybe I don't need a shave.
- Hold still.

378
00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:48.186
I wouldn't want to cut you.

379
00:37:01.991 --> 00:37:04.202
Bret, slow down.

380
00:37:05.036 --> 00:37:09.332
- I thought you loved me.
- I do. I do.

381
00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:11.835
- But, I just...
- But, what?

382
00:37:14.337 --> 00:37:18.216
I don't want to lose my virginity
in the front seat of a truck.

383
00:37:18.383 --> 00:37:21.720
Why didn't you say so?
I got a blanket in the back.

384
00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:26.015
No. That's not it.
I just don't think I'm ready.

385
00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:29.894
- Tammy and Larry do it every night.
- Fine, call them.

386
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:32.731
Have a menage a trois if you want.

387
00:37:32.897 --> 00:37:37.819
- That dirty talk just drives me nuts.
- Bret, no.

388
00:37:37.986 --> 00:37:39.571
Bret, please.

389
00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:43.408
- I'm warning you, okay?
- I can't help it.

390
00:37:43.575 --> 00:37:45.952
You just bring out the beast in me.

391
00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:47.829
Back off!

392
00:37:50.206 --> 00:37:51.833
My balls!

393
00:37:54.294 --> 00:37:56.212
God, my balls!

394
00:38:02.177 --> 00:38:06.639
Damn it! I pissed my pants!
Don't you think you're overreacting?

395
00:38:06.806 --> 00:38:09.434
- I was just copping a feel!
- Overreacting?

396
00:38:09.642 --> 00:38:12.437
I can't believe my mom
was right about you.

397
00:38:12.604 --> 00:38:15.940
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?

398
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.320
Ash, wait. I'm sorry!

399
00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:46.221
Check out Bret.

400
00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:52.060
Let's go! They're coming.
Come on, let's go! Get on your bikes!

401
00:38:54.646 --> 00:38:57.774
- Dude, did you piss your pants?
- We gotta go.

402
00:38:57.941 --> 00:38:59.192
They're coming!

403
00:38:59.401 --> 00:39:02.654
Looks like the only thing going
is you, dude.

404
00:39:09.077 --> 00:39:10.703
Holy crap!

405
00:39:46.614 --> 00:39:49.033
They're getting closer! Move it!

406
00:39:54.748 --> 00:39:59.419
We have ostriches, cats and dogs
disappearing all over town.

407
00:39:59.627 --> 00:40:02.672
Last time I checked, cats and dogs
are not fish.

408
00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:05.467
And ostriches farmed are not game.

409
00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:09.929
There has to be somebody
at Fish and Game who can help.

410
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.514
Hey, watch it!

411
00:41:42.147 --> 00:41:43.481
Yes.

412
00:41:52.323 --> 00:41:54.409
What the hell are these things?

413
00:42:20.185 --> 00:42:23.938
Here we go again.
The phone lines are down.

414
00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:26.858
They'll tell you
it's a technical error.

415
00:42:27.025 --> 00:42:30.445
But you know what it is.
They're shutting us down!

416
00:42:31.154 --> 00:42:35.658
I know what you're saying to yourself.
" He's paranoid. He's crazy."

417
00:42:35.867 --> 00:42:38.495
But you know,
there's an old saying:

418
00:42:38.703 --> 00:42:41.915
Just because I'm paranoid doesn't
mean people aren't following me.

419
00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:45.460
All of a sudden there's
a communication blackout.

420
00:42:45.668 --> 00:42:49.881
At the bottom of the bag.
It's where they always put the food.

421
00:43:00.475 --> 00:43:01.518
Here it is.

422
00:43:01.684 --> 00:43:03.353
Here we go, Bruisie.

423
00:43:04.437 --> 00:43:05.522
Bruisie?

424
00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:27.627
Bruiser?

425
00:43:28.586 --> 00:43:30.046
Aunt Gladys?

426
00:43:35.427 --> 00:43:36.720
Bruiser?

427
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:43.643
Oh, my God.

428
00:43:46.312 --> 00:43:47.897
Oh, Lord.

429
00:43:48.857 --> 00:43:50.275
Are you in there?

430
00:44:02.454 --> 00:44:04.080
Oh, my God!

431
00:44:04.998 --> 00:44:08.168
I'm coming, baby.
I'm coming.

432
00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:11.212
Aunt Gladys, I lost the face fuzz.

433
00:44:21.514 --> 00:44:22.640
Bruiser?

434
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:49.542
Aunt Gladys?

435
00:45:31.209 --> 00:45:33.336
This ain't no cactus.

436
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.943
Mike!

437
00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:02.907
Mike! Sam!

438
00:46:05.577 --> 00:46:07.454
- Can I talk to Mike?
- Why?

439
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.080
I can't explain now.

440
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.502
- Look what I found in my basement.
- That thing is huge!

441
00:46:14.669 --> 00:46:15.920
Give me a second!

442
00:46:22.093 --> 00:46:23.595
Hold this.

443
00:46:26.598 --> 00:46:27.807
What's going on?

444
00:46:29.768 --> 00:46:31.102
So check this out.

445
00:46:31.269 --> 00:46:34.606
After taking careful measurements of
the exoskeleton I found at Joshua's...

446
00:46:34.773 --> 00:46:37.734
...I calculated the spider
was the size shown here.

447
00:46:38.276 --> 00:46:41.988
- What spider?
- The hole in the basement was bigger.

448
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.281
What hole?

449
00:46:43.448 --> 00:46:48.286
Let's input the measurements from
your exoskeleton and see what happens.

450
00:46:51.039 --> 00:46:52.707
That's more like it...

451
00:46:52.874 --> 00:46:54.167
...unfortunately.

452
00:46:54.459 --> 00:46:59.964
- What the hell is this?
- It's my media- Induced nightmare.

453
00:47:15.814 --> 00:47:17.065
Oh, God.

454
00:47:17.232 --> 00:47:20.652
So you're telling me a giant spider
ate Gladys?

455
00:47:20.944 --> 00:47:25.156
- Maybe not. Was there webbing around?
- Yeah, lots of it.

456
00:47:25.323 --> 00:47:28.576
She might have been attacked
by a male orb weaver.

457
00:47:28.743 --> 00:47:30.537
What's the difference?

458
00:47:30.703 --> 00:47:33.832
Males compete for the female
by bringing her presents.

459
00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:37.836
The prey is cocooned alive so
she can feed on it in her nest.

460
00:47:38.002 --> 00:47:42.424
- Women like breakfast in bed.
- So Gladys might still be alive?

461
00:48:23.548 --> 00:48:25.550
That's Ashley! Come on!

462
00:48:39.064 --> 00:48:40.231
Look out!

463
00:48:43.568 --> 00:48:46.279
Keys. Keys, keys, keys!

464
00:48:51.284 --> 00:48:53.286
Mike, get out of here!

465
00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:00.752
- Throw me the scissors!
- Scissors?

466
00:49:01.336 --> 00:49:02.921
Scissors! Here you go!

467
00:49:05.757 --> 00:49:08.468
Sam! Help!

468
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.643
Hey, spidey!

469
00:49:27.195 --> 00:49:28.321
Thank you.

470
00:49:28.988 --> 00:49:30.949
Pete! Come in, Pete.

471
00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:33.410
Hold on to your shirt.

472
00:49:39.874 --> 00:49:41.000
Is that you, Sam?

473
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.213
I don't know what's going on,
but the phones are down.

474
00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.383
I know. Take the weapons
and get to my house.

475
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.469
Guns? Why would we be needing...?

476
00:49:51.636 --> 00:49:52.762
Just do it!

477
00:49:52.929 --> 00:49:55.515
Okay. All right. Okay.

478
00:50:33.178 --> 00:50:36.431
Winchester, 30.06...

479
00:50:37.682 --> 00:50:39.517
...Mossberg pump...

480
00:50:40.018 --> 00:50:42.562
...and the Lee Harvey Oswald rifle.

481
00:50:42.729 --> 00:50:45.565
Why we have that, I do not know.

482
00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:51.196
Why don't you stomp them hills out
and get some room to grow...

483
00:50:51.362 --> 00:50:55.658
- ...before you start making brags!
- Brags, is it?

484
00:51:08.213 --> 00:51:10.215
I'm closing up.

485
00:51:10.382 --> 00:51:13.259
You' re always talking at me
about something.

486
00:51:14.052 --> 00:51:18.306
Can you turn that thing down?
You're already deaf from it.

487
00:51:22.227 --> 00:51:24.062
I said, turn that thing down!

488
00:51:25.563 --> 00:51:26.981
What did you say?

489
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.928
Bob?

490
00:52:00.098 --> 00:52:04.561
First Emma leaves, now Sam's
got me doing spring- Cleaning.

491
00:52:04.769 --> 00:52:06.646
Can't get any worse.

492
00:52:35.508 --> 00:52:38.762
So, what happened
with you and Brian anyway?

493
00:52:41.347 --> 00:52:44.559
He wasn't exactly the faithful type.

494
00:52:44.976 --> 00:52:48.104
I've been trying to tell you
this for a long time...

495
00:52:48.313 --> 00:52:50.857
You can handle one of these, right?

496
00:52:54.235 --> 00:52:58.406
- Ashley, Mike, you guys ready?
- Just a minute, Mom.

497
00:52:58.573 --> 00:53:03.495
- How many spiders did Joshua have?
- I don't know. 100, maybe 200.

498
00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:08.208
- Two hundred? Are you kidding me?
- Hurry up, guys. Time to go.

499
00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:12.837
Joshua's spiders are nocturnal hunters.
They're coming out to feed.

500
00:53:13.004 --> 00:53:16.466
- We have to warn everybody.
- The phone lines are down.

501
00:53:16.674 --> 00:53:19.886
To spread the word,
to look into the dark places...

502
00:53:20.053 --> 00:53:25.350
- ...our government- Controlled media...
- We could broadcast a warning!

503
00:53:25.517 --> 00:53:27.477
Who'll believe that lunatic?

504
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.282
What was that?

505
00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:44.160
What the...?

506
00:53:46.287 --> 00:53:48.248
What the hell is going on?

507
00:53:48.415 --> 00:53:51.543
It's Pete. He's waiting.
Come on, let's go.

508
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.086
See you, Ash.

509
00:53:53.253 --> 00:53:55.714
I don't think that was Pete.

510
00:54:10.937 --> 00:54:12.731
Oh, my God.

511
00:54:17.902 --> 00:54:19.612
Holy moly!

512
00:54:19.779 --> 00:54:23.742
Everybody get in the car, now!
Ashley, go!

513
00:54:26.119 --> 00:54:27.245
Come on!

514
00:54:27.412 --> 00:54:29.497
Look out, Sam!

515
00:54:36.838 --> 00:54:38.131
Come on!

516
00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:44.387
What are you waiting for? Go!

517
00:54:44.554 --> 00:54:46.806
Habronattus orbus.

518
00:54:47.348 --> 00:54:48.683
The jumper.

519
00:55:06.493 --> 00:55:09.996
Stay in the car.
Pete, honk if there are any problems.

520
00:55:10.163 --> 00:55:11.289
You got it, Sam.

521
00:55:11.456 --> 00:55:13.750
- Mom.
- Stay in the car!

522
00:55:13.917 --> 00:55:15.585
Guys, stay.

523
00:55:19.089 --> 00:55:22.050
- What are you doing?
- I need to make a broadcast.

524
00:55:22.217 --> 00:55:26.262
- You can't oppress me...
- Show me how this thing works.

525
00:55:26.471 --> 00:55:30.100
Consider this a government conspiracy
to take over your station.

526
00:55:30.308 --> 00:55:31.768
Here.

527
00:55:31.976 --> 00:55:32.977
Friends...

528
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.064
...our local authorities have...

529
00:55:36.231 --> 00:55:39.651
...an emergency message
for our little community.

530
00:55:39.818 --> 00:55:43.530
This is Sheriff Parker.
I have an important announcement.

531
00:55:44.697 --> 00:55:47.242
Pete, turn on the radio.

532
00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:51.162
This is not a prank or
one of Harlan's crazy stunts.

533
00:55:51.329 --> 00:55:54.416
We have a crisis situation
on our hands.

534
00:55:54.582 --> 00:55:59.045
The town is being overrun
by giant spiders.

535
00:55:59.421 --> 00:56:03.425
I know how this sounds,
but you must trust me on this.

536
00:56:03.633 --> 00:56:06.845
I want everyone to arm
themselves immediately.

537
00:56:07.011 --> 00:56:08.346
I repeat:

538
00:56:08.847 --> 00:56:12.267
Giant spiders are all over the town.

539
00:56:12.434 --> 00:56:17.856
- Did she just say giant spiders?
- That's just Harlan's show.

540
00:56:18.022 --> 00:56:21.818
Giant spiders? What the hell
kind of bullshit is that?

541
00:56:21.985 --> 00:56:24.696
Aliens you believe,
this you have a hard time with?

542
00:56:28.908 --> 00:56:33.705
Why didn't someone say something?
Look at me. God.

543
00:56:50.221 --> 00:56:51.639
I gotta warn Sam.

544
00:56:51.806 --> 00:56:54.350
No! Noise will just attract it.

545
00:56:54.517 --> 00:56:57.729
- What should I do?
- Give me the walkie- Talkie!

546
00:57:00.857 --> 00:57:03.526
- Mom, are you there?
- Yeah, Mike.

547
00:57:03.693 --> 00:57:07.072
- Ls everything okay?
- Don't make any noises.

548
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.658
There's a giant tarantula headed
your way.

549
00:57:11.951 --> 00:57:13.286
Copy that.

550
00:57:21.753 --> 00:57:23.797
Oh, my God!

551
00:57:23.963 --> 00:57:26.341
They're here!

552
00:57:26.508 --> 00:57:29.386
You're just food to that thing!

553
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:38.603
Attention, people.
Everyone meet at the Prosperity Mall.

554
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:53.410
I repeat:

555
00:57:57.497 --> 00:57:59.457
The Prosperity Mall!

556
00:57:59.833 --> 00:58:03.420
- Why the mall?
- Concrete walls, steel doors.

557
00:58:21.646 --> 00:58:23.648
Did you see that thing?

558
00:58:57.932 --> 00:58:59.225
Come on!

559
00:59:00.518 --> 00:59:04.147
I have four more payments
on this shit!

560
00:59:09.194 --> 00:59:11.946
- Come on! Hurry!
- It's coming this way!

561
00:59:13.031 --> 00:59:14.365
Go! Go!

562
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.241
Come on!

563
01:01:33.546 --> 01:01:37.008
- Can I get a refill, Carol?
- Help yourself, sweetie.

564
01:01:41.179 --> 01:01:45.475
- That was an excellent ostrich burger.
- Well, thank you.

565
01:01:47.644 --> 01:01:49.270
Kind of slow today, huh?

566
01:01:49.604 --> 01:01:51.856
It's always slow here, Wade.

567
01:01:53.358 --> 01:01:58.238
There's no way you're telling me
that thing back there is from Earth.

568
01:01:58.405 --> 01:02:02.367
All right! They're spiders from Mars.
You happy?

569
01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:05.537
No.

570
01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:34.983
It's the invasion!

571
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:38.695
I'm telling you, it's the invasion!
I told you!

572
01:02:38.903 --> 01:02:43.742
Everyone, just get to the mall
as quick as you can!

573
01:02:47.912 --> 01:02:51.791
Get to the Prosperity Mall
as soon as possible.

574
01:02:58.131 --> 01:02:59.924
Arach- Attack.

575
01:03:28.787 --> 01:03:31.456
If you build it, they will come.

576
01:03:52.644 --> 01:03:55.647
Get everyone inside
and get the gate down.

577
01:03:55.814 --> 01:03:57.357
Kids, go with him.

578
01:03:57.857 --> 01:03:59.526
Oswald's gun.

579
01:03:59.692 --> 01:04:02.112
This is the weirdest day of my life.

580
01:04:04.489 --> 01:04:06.116
What is going on?

581
01:04:06.491 --> 01:04:08.410
Look behind you!

582
01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:33.643
- How do you lower the gate?
- Key.

583
01:04:33.852 --> 01:04:35.353
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

584
01:04:35.979 --> 01:04:37.772
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

585
01:04:38.982 --> 01:04:42.318
- That's the back gate. The lavatory.
- Come on!

586
01:04:42.485 --> 01:04:46.656
- You're making me nervous!
- I'm making you nervous. Give me that!

587
01:04:47.157 --> 01:04:50.744
- Could it be the "front gate" one?
- Yeah, front gate.

588
01:04:53.079 --> 01:04:54.622
- Come on!
- Come on!

589
01:04:55.248 --> 01:04:56.916
Get inside! Hurry!

590
01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:10.430
Mom, hurry up! Come on!

591
01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:14.142
Mom, hurry! Hurry!

592
01:05:19.439 --> 01:05:21.066
Mom, come on! Hurry up!

593
01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:30.033
Mom, are you okay?

594
01:05:33.745 --> 01:05:35.622
What exactly is that?

595
01:05:36.039 --> 01:05:37.624
Spider, man.

596
01:05:41.419 --> 01:05:44.756
How's the lock- Down holding?
This one's pretty good.

597
01:05:44.923 --> 01:05:47.884
They're holding, but we
don't have much time.

598
01:05:49.135 --> 01:05:52.222
Okay. All the doors are locked
and secured.

599
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:57.560
No breaches out front. I haven't heard
a sound. I think the doors will hold.

600
01:05:57.769 --> 01:06:01.106
- Someone ought to get back there...
- Go.

601
01:06:01.272 --> 01:06:03.858
We have a right to know
what's going on!

602
01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:06.111
Those things killed Leroy.

603
01:06:06.277 --> 01:06:10.240
Bob Miller, my best customer,
was hanging from my ceiling.

604
01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:12.367
What am I doing on the radio?

605
01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:15.912
I've been telling you about
the invasion for months.

606
01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:18.790
Am I talking to myself?
I'm here for you.

607
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:23.336
- You saying those things are aliens?
- You're not listening...

608
01:06:23.503 --> 01:06:25.964
Mom, they have to be quiet.

609
01:06:26.131 --> 01:06:29.467
Those were big- Ass spiders!
Really big ones!

610
01:06:29.634 --> 01:06:31.469
Shut up!

611
01:06:31.636 --> 01:06:34.681
Let's listen to the kid. For once.

612
01:06:34.848 --> 01:06:36.141
Go on, Mike.

613
01:06:40.019 --> 01:06:44.899
First of all, the spiders are attracted
to vibrations. That includes:

614
01:06:45.066 --> 01:06:49.112
Loud noises, movement and talking.

615
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.241
So everybody needs to stay as calm
and quiet as possible.

616
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:57.954
- Why didn't you call in the Army?
- Where have you been, Wade?

617
01:06:58.163 --> 01:07:01.458
- The phones are dead.
- Does anyone have a cell phone?

618
01:07:01.624 --> 01:07:04.669
Use mine. You have to climb a mountain
for a signal.

619
01:07:04.836 --> 01:07:09.424
Use the antenna on the mall.
That's how I get my broadcast out.

620
01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:13.553
- Have someone climb and get a signal.
- That's a great idea.

621
01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.472
Be a hero.

622
01:07:17.307 --> 01:07:18.683
I'll do it.

623
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.518
No, Sam. Let me.

624
01:07:20.852 --> 01:07:23.104
I got your back.

625
01:07:24.439 --> 01:07:27.067
- Great.
- I've fought aliens my whole life.

626
01:07:27.233 --> 01:07:30.862
About time I busted up a few of them.
Face to face.

627
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:33.490
They're not aliens. They're spiders!

628
01:07:33.656 --> 01:07:36.701
Those of you without weapons,
arm yourselves...

629
01:07:36.868 --> 01:07:41.873
...with anything that you can dig up.
Then we'll meet back here.

630
01:07:44.876 --> 01:07:46.002
Norman?

631
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.714
- Show me the way to the roof.
- Where?

632
01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:53.051
- The roof, Norman!
- The roof. The roof!

633
01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.294
- How's it looking?
- Roof's clear.

634
01:08:28.545 --> 01:08:29.838
Be careful, Chris.

635
01:08:31.047 --> 01:08:32.382
Thanks, Sam.

636
01:08:32.924 --> 01:08:37.262
I've been trying to say something
to you, so I'll just say it.

637
01:08:37.429 --> 01:08:41.307
- Okay, take these. You'll need them.
- Perfume?

638
01:08:41.474 --> 01:08:46.521
Spiders have a developed sense of
smell. The perfume could confuse them.

639
01:08:46.688 --> 01:08:51.609
- Great. We die, we die smelling nice.
- Nobody is dying, okay?

640
01:09:10.545 --> 01:09:13.214
That's the one who busted up
my trailer!

641
01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:15.925
I bet you he's their leader.

642
01:09:39.699 --> 01:09:41.242
Come on.

643
01:09:44.704 --> 01:09:47.207
- You have the phone?
- I thought you did.

644
01:09:47.374 --> 01:09:49.042
You said you had it.

645
01:09:49.334 --> 01:09:51.836
Yeah, I got it. Sorry.

646
01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.713
I got confused.

647
01:10:22.033 --> 01:10:23.034
Damn it.

648
01:10:41.386 --> 01:10:45.056
- I got a signal!
- Great. Now, how about dialing?

649
01:10:45.807 --> 01:10:47.267
911 emergency.

650
01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:51.396
I'm calling from Prosperity, Arizona.
My name is Chris McCormack.

651
01:10:51.771 --> 01:10:56.067
I know how this sounds, but believe me.
It's the truth.

652
01:10:56.234 --> 01:11:01.656
Our town is being attacked by giant
spiders. We need military intervention.

653
01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:04.743
- This is not Dial- A- Joke.
- This is not a crank.

654
01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:07.954
- I'm hanging up on you.
- Don't hang up. Please!

655
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:10.040
It's an invasion!

656
01:11:10.206 --> 01:11:13.001
They' re here! They' re here!

657
01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:15.837
That's what I've been telling you!

658
01:11:17.547 --> 01:11:20.467
I don't know if those gates will hold.

659
01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:22.427
I have to find Wade.

660
01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.972
Has anyone seen Wade?

661
01:11:26.848 --> 01:11:28.933
He went through a door back there.

662
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.103
Between the Sewing Center
and the Cinemaplex?

663
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:35.607
He's going into the mines
through the storage room.

664
01:11:35.774 --> 01:11:39.694
Take everyone who's hurt and the kids
to that storage room.

665
01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:42.614
Norman, show them.
Now! Go!

666
01:11:48.578 --> 01:11:50.080
Here we go!

667
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.924
Get ready.

668
01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:07.430
- Get ready!
- Oh, yeah!

669
01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:46.636
Got one!

670
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:57.689
Everybody get to the basement, now!
Hurry!

671
01:13:47.947 --> 01:13:49.491
Pete, come on!

672
01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:55.538
Go, Sam! Get downstairs!
I'll find another way out!

673
01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:00.418
Guys, go!

674
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.358
Come on!

675
01:14:27.195 --> 01:14:29.114
- It's locked!
- What?

676
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.492
He must have locked it.
We're trapped.

677
01:15:23.293 --> 01:15:27.130
Get back! You eight- Legged freaks!

678
01:15:27.297 --> 01:15:30.800
- My God! There's so many!
- Harlan, get up here!

679
01:15:32.927 --> 01:15:34.679
I'm afraid of heights.

680
01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.267
Heights? Are you afraid of spiders?!

681
01:15:41.686 --> 01:15:44.814
- Come on, Harlan!
- I'll try to lead them away.

682
01:15:45.106 --> 01:15:46.149
You'll what?

683
01:15:46.357 --> 01:15:48.693
Defend the human race.

684
01:15:51.154 --> 01:15:53.490
What are you, insane?

685
01:16:01.831 --> 01:16:05.418
You'll never get that anal probe
near me!

686
01:16:06.211 --> 01:16:07.420
Harlan, no!

687
01:16:25.897 --> 01:16:28.733
You know what?
Let's just go back inside.

688
01:16:29.234 --> 01:16:30.360
Locked.

689
01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:33.988
Plan B?

690
01:16:34.739 --> 01:16:38.076
I tell you what.
We're just gonna run away.

691
01:16:38.243 --> 01:16:39.369
Yeah?

692
01:16:39.536 --> 01:16:40.912
Okay.

693
01:17:41.306 --> 01:17:42.557
Bret?

694
01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.225
Wade?

695
01:17:44.642 --> 01:17:47.604
- What are you doing here?
- I can't find my way out.

696
01:17:47.812 --> 01:17:51.107
You won't believe me, but
I've been chased by giant spiders.

697
01:17:51.274 --> 01:17:52.776
Down here?

698
01:17:52.984 --> 01:17:57.864
A second ago they were right behind me,
but I think I lost them.

699
01:18:01.493 --> 01:18:03.036
No, you didn't.

700
01:18:04.454 --> 01:18:06.122
Go! Go, go!

701
01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:34.275
Sam!

702
01:18:34.526 --> 01:18:37.821
- Chris, where are you?
- Sam, I'm up here!

703
01:18:38.196 --> 01:18:40.657
What the hell are you doing up there?

704
01:18:40.865 --> 01:18:44.244
- Just chilling. Get me out of here!
- Back up.

705
01:18:47.497 --> 01:18:50.375
Wait. You push and I'll pull.

706
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:48.600
Ashley?

707
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.393
Mom?

708
01:19:51.728 --> 01:19:54.105
Wade locked the door.

709
01:20:00.653 --> 01:20:04.240
- They're all around us!
- Everybody hide. Take cover!

710
01:20:11.414 --> 01:20:12.749
Bret?

711
01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:14.751
Behind you!

712
01:20:34.646 --> 01:20:37.273
- Bret?
- Ashley.

713
01:20:38.525 --> 01:20:41.986
- We better hurry!
- Everybody, let's move. Come on!

714
01:20:43.988 --> 01:20:45.990
Into the mines. Hurry!

715
01:20:47.325 --> 01:20:50.412
There's gotta be flashlights
or something.

716
01:20:52.288 --> 01:20:54.374
Grab one of these.

717
01:20:54.541 --> 01:20:58.294
Cool, a miner's helmet.
I always wanted to try one.

718
01:21:02.966 --> 01:21:08.346
- Can you lead these people out of here?
- You bet. Come on, everybody! Let's go.

719
01:21:20.525 --> 01:21:21.901
This should hold him.

720
01:21:27.907 --> 01:21:28.950
I hope.

721
01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:31.828
How do we get out?

722
01:21:31.995 --> 01:21:37.375
We follow the power lines to a
generator. They're always near an exit.

723
01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:41.671
- Come on! Not that way. Hurry!
- This way.

724
01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.423
Follow the kid!

725
01:21:45.383 --> 01:21:46.718
Hurry up!

726
01:21:47.218 --> 01:21:51.222
You went back for that?
Lose that thing. It'll slow us down!

727
01:21:51.389 --> 01:21:54.601
This saved my ass so many times today!

728
01:21:58.855 --> 01:22:00.231
What's that smell?

729
01:22:00.398 --> 01:22:02.025
Wasn't me.

730
01:22:02.901 --> 01:22:04.903
Methane gas. A lot of it.

731
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:06.237
Listen up!

732
01:22:06.529 --> 01:22:10.784
The slightest spark or an open flame
can blow us all to hell.

733
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:14.537
So be careful. Let's go.

734
01:22:15.372 --> 01:22:19.709
Cables lead to a generator.
Follow the cables.

735
01:22:19.876 --> 01:22:21.044
Cables.

736
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:23.129
Way to a generator.

737
01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:26.549
You guys!

738
01:22:26.716 --> 01:22:28.593
It's this way!

739
01:22:31.596 --> 01:22:35.850
Follow the cables.
The cables lead to a generator.

740
01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:38.770
Follow the cables.

741
01:23:02.293 --> 01:23:05.088
Norman! Somebody save him!

742
01:23:08.133 --> 01:23:11.886
No gunfire! No gunfire!
It will set off the gas!

743
01:23:16.099 --> 01:23:17.559
Catch!

744
01:23:26.776 --> 01:23:30.447
Come on, hurry!
Into the tunnel. Follow the cables.

745
01:23:30.655 --> 01:23:31.990
Let's go!

746
01:23:37.829 --> 01:23:39.289
People, hold on!

747
01:23:40.373 --> 01:23:42.125
What the hell is this?

748
01:23:44.044 --> 01:23:46.129
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

749
01:23:46.296 --> 01:23:50.008
That spider back there,
was that the female?

750
01:23:50.175 --> 01:23:52.677
No. That was just another male.

751
01:23:52.844 --> 01:23:56.431
The female is three times as big.

752
01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:59.476
So she's probably still close by,
right?

753
01:23:59.642 --> 01:24:01.519
Yeah, I'd say so.

754
01:24:01.686 --> 01:24:05.815
Go back with your sister.
Go back with your sister!

755
01:24:10.487 --> 01:24:12.447
- Why are you here?
- Mom sent me.

756
01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:15.033
- Why?
- You don't want to know.

757
01:24:20.163 --> 01:24:23.833
We have to do it.
It's the only way out.

758
01:24:26.711 --> 01:24:28.254
Oh, my God.

759
01:24:30.215 --> 01:24:31.758
What the hell?

760
01:24:40.225 --> 01:24:41.226
What is it?

761
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:45.939
I think it's alive.

762
01:24:50.402 --> 01:24:52.070
Don't touch it.

763
01:24:53.405 --> 01:24:55.281
Don't...

764
01:25:03.581 --> 01:25:05.375
It's Wade.

765
01:25:05.542 --> 01:25:08.420
Bret, just go, okay? Just go.

766
01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.298
Let's get him down.

767
01:25:18.805 --> 01:25:20.432
Wade.

768
01:25:20.932 --> 01:25:23.476
- I don't feel so hot.
- Hold on a second.

769
01:25:44.497 --> 01:25:47.751
Look at the size of that!

770
01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:56.593
What the hell is this place, Mike?

771
01:25:56.801 --> 01:26:00.388
- Lt looks like an orb weaver den.
- Get us out of here.

772
01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.057
- I can't.
- Why not?

773
01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:06.061
Is there a chance that Gladys
is still alive?

774
01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:09.064
- It's possible.
- Are you crazy?

775
01:26:09.272 --> 01:26:12.442
You'll have to get out without me.
Follow the wires.

776
01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:15.070
There's a shed outside
with a generator.

777
01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:18.073
- Start it quickly.
- What are you up to?

778
01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.991
I got an idea.

779
01:26:24.662 --> 01:26:27.290
I get it. Everybody, come on.

780
01:26:27.457 --> 01:26:29.918
Follow the cables. This way. Come on.

781
01:26:30.085 --> 01:26:32.629
- Bret, I'll need your bike.
- My bike?

782
01:26:32.837 --> 01:26:36.591
- Just do it.
- All right, kids, come on.

783
01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:39.969
Leave it there. I've been trying
to say this for a while.

784
01:26:40.303 --> 01:26:44.682
- Now?
- Yes, I may not get another chance.

785
01:26:44.849 --> 01:26:47.894
- I should've said this a long time ago.
- I know.

786
01:26:48.061 --> 01:26:50.605
You beat up my ex because you found
out he was cheating.

787
01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:53.400
You couldn't tell me because
you didn't want to break up my family.

788
01:26:53.566 --> 01:26:55.443
And you've always loved me.

789
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:59.239
And if you'd said something,
maybe our lives would be different.

790
01:26:59.406 --> 01:27:00.949
Exactly.

791
01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:03.284
Your father told me.

792
01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:04.703
My dad told you?

793
01:27:04.869 --> 01:27:08.164
Now, get moving so you can
make it up to me later.

794
01:27:09.332 --> 01:27:10.750
Go on.

795
01:27:11.668 --> 01:27:13.336
That was easy.

796
01:27:23.012 --> 01:27:24.347
Gladys.

797
01:27:43.616 --> 01:27:45.827
This way. Follow me. Come on.

798
01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.343
Breathe.

799
01:28:09.642 --> 01:28:11.102
You're alive.

800
01:28:14.105 --> 01:28:16.608
You look like an angel.

801
01:28:17.317 --> 01:28:19.652
All that gold.

802
01:28:20.653 --> 01:28:22.405
Gold?

803
01:28:22.614 --> 01:28:24.115
Right behind you.

804
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:29.287
The Agua Mesa lode.
He found it.

805
01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:36.252
We need to find the generator.

806
01:28:36.461 --> 01:28:39.339
Mark, get everybody
away from the mines.

807
01:28:39.506 --> 01:28:42.634
Hurry up. Get away from the mines.
Get up there.

808
01:28:42.801 --> 01:28:46.638
Mom, what about that one?
Come on.

809
01:29:01.486 --> 01:29:03.446
I knew he wasn't crazy.

810
01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.870
What are you doing?

811
01:29:11.037 --> 01:29:13.373
No, no. No smoking.

812
01:29:13.665 --> 01:29:15.709
We gotta get out of here.

813
01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.136
Stand back.

814
01:29:26.845 --> 01:29:29.806
Shoot it! Shoot it!

815
01:29:30.056 --> 01:29:32.809
I'll set off the gas! I can't!

816
01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:34.978
Get back.

817
01:29:50.702 --> 01:29:53.329
Mike, you saved us.

818
01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.585
I need this more than you.

819
01:30:11.723 --> 01:30:15.643
- Damn it. Why isn't it working?
- Lt needs fuel.

820
01:30:16.436 --> 01:30:19.022
- See?
- All right, find gas tanks.

821
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:22.192
Anything you can find.
We need gasoline.

822
01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.781
Hurry! Hurry!

823
01:30:28.907 --> 01:30:32.660
- What are you doing?
- Lt'll set off the gas.

824
01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:39.292
Hurry!

825
01:30:53.765 --> 01:30:58.686
- All the gas cans are empty.
- We just need one electrical surge.

826
01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.856
Keep looking, everybody.
Don't give up.

827
01:31:04.484 --> 01:31:06.569
Here, will this work?

828
01:31:07.654 --> 01:31:09.823
Ashley, you're a genius.

829
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.139
Switch. Put this on.

830
01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:40.687
Mom, it worked.

831
01:32:04.210 --> 01:32:06.588
Adios, Consuela.

832
01:32:08.506 --> 01:32:09.716
Fire!

833
01:32:34.866 --> 01:32:37.202
Aunt Gladys, are you okay?

834
01:32:50.423 --> 01:32:53.551
Not my mall. Not my mall.

835
01:32:54.803 --> 01:32:58.014
Not the mall. Please, not the mall.

836
01:33:04.896 --> 01:33:07.232
I hope the insurance pays for this.

837
01:33:27.085 --> 01:33:28.753
Let's go! Let's go!

838
01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:32.048
I thought you said 911
didn't believe you.

839
01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.466
They didn't.

840
01:33:33.633 --> 01:33:35.719
They listen to my broadcast.

841
01:33:35.969 --> 01:33:37.470
We never miss a show.

842
01:33:37.637 --> 01:33:40.807
We drove from Tucson.
It sounded like you needed help.

843
01:33:40.974 --> 01:33:42.934
Where are the aliens?

844
01:33:43.101 --> 01:33:47.439
How many times do I have to tell you?
They're not aliens, okay?

845
01:33:47.605 --> 01:33:51.693
They're spiders who grew
because they ingested toxic waste.

846
01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.487
That's a more believable explanation.

847
01:33:54.654 --> 01:33:58.867
I had to drag that barrel out
of the water. I got covered in it.

848
01:33:59.034 --> 01:34:01.870
- And your point is?
- Point?

849
01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:07.792
See this? All brand new. Brand new
growth. Check it out. Brand new.

850
01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:09.627
Are you all right?

851
01:34:09.794 --> 01:34:12.422
- Do you smoke?
- No.

852
01:34:12.630 --> 01:34:13.757
Good.

853
01:34:14.466 --> 01:34:19.137
Dangerous habit. Disgusting. Causes
explosions. Wish I'd never started.

854
01:34:19.554 --> 01:34:24.601
- Any more people down in those mines?
- My aunt was the only one alive.

855
01:34:24.809 --> 01:34:28.396
I checked the other cocoons,
but nobody made it.

856
01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:31.941
We got cocoons! T old you
it would be worth the ride!

857
01:34:32.108 --> 01:34:34.277
Glad you came back home?

858
01:34:36.196 --> 01:34:38.656
Yeah, I am.

859
01:34:39.699 --> 01:34:41.201
Me too.

860
01:34:41.868 --> 01:34:45.872
That is the story of how the aliens
attacked our sleepy town.

861
01:34:46.039 --> 01:34:49.417
To this day, people refuse to believe
what happened here.

862
01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:53.171
They'd lead you to believe
I would embellish this story.

863
01:34:53.338 --> 01:34:55.757
But we know the truth.

864
01:34:55.924 --> 01:34:59.135
Two things I forgot to tell you.

865
01:34:59.302 --> 01:35:03.681
One: They never did get that probe
near me.

866
01:35:03.848 --> 01:35:08.812
And two: As far as Chris McCormack
reopening the gold mines...

867
01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:12.315
...and putting everyone
back to work...

868
01:35:12.482 --> 01:35:15.026
Well, that, my friends...

869
01:35:15.193 --> 01:35:18.113
...is another story altogether.
