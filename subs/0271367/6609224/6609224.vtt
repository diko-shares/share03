Why?

1302
01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:13.782
You don't want to know.

1303
01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:19.854
We have to do it.

1304
01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.856
It's the only way out.

1305
01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:24.159
Okay.

1306
01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.396
Oh, my God...

1307
01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.666
What the hell?

1308
01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.609
What is it?

1309
01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.680
I think it's alive.

1310
01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.986
Don't touch it.

1311
01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:53.189
Don't, don't...

1312
01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.231
It's Wade.

1313
01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:04.332
It's Wade.

1314
01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:05.767
Bret, just go, okay?

1315
01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:06.768
Just go.

1316
01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.703
Wade?

1317
01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.306
Let's get him down.

1318
01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:16.911
Oops.

1319
01:25:16.912 --> 01:25:18.481
Wade?

1320
01:25:19.882 --> 01:25:21.048
I don't feel so hot.

1321
01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:22.351
Hold on a second.

1322
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.873
Wow, look at the size of that.

1323
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.349
What the hellis this place, Mike?

1324
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:57.285
It looks likean orb weaver den.

1325
01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.221
Okay, Chris, get usout of here fast.

1326

Sam, I can't.

Why not?

1328
01:26:01.524 --> 01:26:03.958
Is there a chanceGladys is still alive?

1329
01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:06.127
Well, it's possible.

1330
01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:07.629
Are you crazy?

1331
01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.364
Sam, you'll have toget out without me.

1332
01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.098
Keep followingthose wires.

1333
01:26:11.099 --> 01:26:12.834
There's a wooden shedon the outside

1334
01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.168
with a generator.

1335
01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.903

1337
01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.941
I've got an idea.

1338

Sam, Sam.

1347
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.591
Just leave it there.

1348
01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:38.760
I've tried to tell you thisfor a long time.

1349
01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:40.328
Now?

1350
01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:42.897
I may not get another chance.

1351
01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:45.199
I should have said thisa long time ago.

1352
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.368
I know.

1353
01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:47.702
You beat up my ex

1354
01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:49.404
because you found outhe was cheating on me,

1355
01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:50.838
and you couldn't tell me,

1356
01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:52.507
because you didn't want
tobreak up my family,

1357
01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:54.208
and you love me, you've always love me,

1358
01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.510
and if you'd told me sooner,

1359
01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.144
maybe our liveswould be different.

1360
01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:59.080
Exactly.

1361
01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:01.148
Your father told me.

My dad told you?

1363
01:27:02.985 --> 01:27:06.221
Yes. Now get moving, so you
canmake it up to me later.
