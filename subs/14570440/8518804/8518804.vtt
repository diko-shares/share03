1
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.333
Get out of here! Scram!

2
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.000
C'mon!

3
00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.458
Shut her up!

4
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:35.749
What are you looking at?! I want
you in front!

5
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.040
Move it, Chepe!

6
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.207
I'm coming.

7
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:39.332
Three... Two...

8
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.207
One...

9
00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:41.083
Let's go!

10
00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.083
Out in front, Chepe!

11
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:19.666
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

12
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.083
Shoes on, now.

13
00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:44.290
- I'm not telling you again. -
I'm coming!

14
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.375
Hurry up, everyone.

15
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.833
What are you doing?

16
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.708
Chepe?

17
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.000
Chepe!

18
00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:42.000
Two besos, two chocolate
conchas,

19
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.375
and two ojos de buey. How many
is that?

20
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.749
A dozen.

21
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.166
Today is a big day, why not make
it two dozen?

22
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.541
Yeah, right?

23
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.666
Can I?

24
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.375
Hurry, come on.

25
00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:25.083
Good morning my loves.

26
00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:26.915
Everyone had a good breakfast?

27
00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.707
Everyone except for Papa. He
only took coffee.

28
00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:32.332
Straight home after school,
right?

29
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.541
Yes.

30
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.375
Where were you?

31
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.208
Hop on.

32
00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.250
Better you get off here.

33
00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.124
Chepe, do I have to go?

34
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:22.290
What did we agree?

35
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:23.790
Just for a few days.

36
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.207
Right, after that no one will
come poking around.

37
00:05:26.208 --> 00:05:29.125
And then I can work with you,
no?

38
00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:31.333
We'll see, Nico.

39
00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:38.041
- Morning, Director. - Good
morning.

40
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.375
Stay close to the others.

41
00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:10.958
- Look, toys! - Hey, get back
here.

42
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.833
WELCOME BACK STUDENTS!

43
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.208
Silence!

44
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:01.500
Silence, please.

45
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.582
Silence is the foundation of
obedience.

46
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:13.124
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,

47
00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:13.166
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

48
00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:19.083
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

49
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:26.541
So, let's review our rules,
shall we?

50
00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:28.790
Yeah!

51
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:31.666
- Good morning. - I brought
enough for everyone.

52
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.040
I'm glad to see that everyone -

53
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.500
Uh... Mr. Juárez?

54
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.082
Well, that almost everyone is
here.

55
00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:44.874
As you know, Mrs. Álvarez gave
birth to a baby boy,

56
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:48.999
and two days ago decided to
become a full-time mother.

57
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.165
Fortunately, we found Mr.
Juárez,

58
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.332
He's from here in Matamoros,

59
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:56.540
and he kindly took the job at
the last-minute.

60
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.375
He's got a pulse, he's hired.

61
00:08:00.708 --> 00:08:03.665
There's not much I can say you
don't already know, so I'll be

62
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.582
brief

63
00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:09.290
Although primary education is
mandatory and free,

64
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:11.290
over half of our sixth graders

65
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.290
are dropping out. We are
failing.

66
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:17.290
According to our ENLACE test
scores we are the very worst.

67
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:19.790
I'm sure you're all aware of
this by now,

68
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.165
this year they approved an
incentive bonus

69
00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.665
for those who meet certain score
thresholds.

70
00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:31.207
If that can motivate us to do
our jobs just a little bit

71
00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:33.332
better.

72
00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.833
Let's not forget our kids, okay?

73
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.833
So... Let's have a good year,
shall we?

74
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:53.165
Do you smell that? Smells like
something.

75
00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:56.125
It smells like... trash.

76
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:03.707
Hurry up! Quickly now!

77
00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.374
We don't have much time! -
What happened to the desks?

78
00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.624
- Those aren't desks. - Why are
they upside down?

79
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.999
They're lifeboats!

80
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.208
And that's not the floor...

81
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:14.082
It's the ocean!

82
00:09:14.083 --> 00:09:17.332
Each boat can only hold the same
number of passengers.

83
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:20.124
Those who don't get into a boat
will drown.

84
00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:20.500
But be careful -

85
00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:23.499
If any boat has more passengers
than the others it will sink

86
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.040
and everyone on board will
drown.

87
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.082
There's 23 of us here and only
six boats,

88
00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:32.040
so, figure it out. Ready? Let's
go!

89
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.040
Five... four...

90
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:37.208
- Get in! - Three... two...!

91
00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:39.125
One!

92
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.208
Come on!

93
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.375
Don't worry! I'll save you!

94
00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.290
Help!

95
00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:52.041
Help me! Please! Someone help
me!

96
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.541
Help... me...

97
00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:35.041
Now eight boats!

98
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.041
What the hell is going on here?!

99
00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:43.207
There's one last passenger! Save
him!

100
00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:48.082
Five, four, three, two!

101
00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:50.707
No, he's too fat! We won't
float!

102
00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.083
He'll sink the boat!

103
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:55.166
Wait wait -

104
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.290
Why would he sink it?

105
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.249
Here's an interesting question.

106
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.165
What makes a boat float?

107
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:08.124
Or what determines how much
weight a boat can hold?

108
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.832
Anyone know?

109
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:11.208
No one?

110
00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.166
Do you know?

111
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.083
No... I don't know either.

112
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.415
Yeah I don't know either.

113
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:28.708
Where do we find answers to
things we don't know?

114
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.040
How about the Internet?!

115
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:34.874
I believe there's a computer
lab? - Yes.

116
00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:37.708
It's out of service at the
moment.

117
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.207
Okay.

118
00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:44.208
Where else can we find answers?

119
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.207
We ask the teacher.

120
00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:53.041
We tried that but as you've seen
We don't know very much.

121
00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:56.665
How about books?

122
00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:59.166
Is the library in service?

123
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.041
To the library! Let's go!

124
00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:10.708
Where's the library?

125
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.083
Come on, let's go!

126
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:33.499
- May I help you? - Yes
please... Mrs. Florita.

127
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.249
We don't have any class visits
scheduled today.

128
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.749
You don't have anything
scheduled for today.

129
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.999
Procedure requires notifying the
library at least one day in

130
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.624
advance,

131
00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.207
with desired reference materials
identified in advance.

132
00:12:47.208 --> 00:12:51.041
Yeah, yeah, but we'll be quick.
Where are the encyclopedias?

133
00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.707
They're here in back, BUT - -
Come on!

134
00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:56.040
- This way. - Hey!

135
00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.208
No running, please.

136
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.749
1974.

137
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.541
What did we come for?

138
00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.665
Boats, barcos...

139
00:13:06.666 --> 00:13:07.000
Oh, man.

140
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:08.540
There's no 'B'.

141
00:13:08.541 --> 00:13:12.457
There's no 'B'. Where else can
we look?

142
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15.708
How about 'F', for flotation?

143
00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.499
You know what?

144
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.582
We don't need the encyclopedia.

145
00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:38.125
You can figure this out on your
own.

146
00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:40.125
Tell me.

147
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:43.208
Why do...

148
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.541
Why do things float?

149
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.082
Anyone?

150
00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:51.540
Somebody. Just take a guess.

151
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:53.707
It doesn't matter if you're
wrong,

152
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.082
what matters is that you try.

153
00:13:56.083 --> 00:13:56.208
what matters is that you try. In fact,
I'd prefer you get it wrong.

154
00:13:56.209 --> 00:13:58.999
In fact, I'd prefer you get it
wrong.

155
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.124
Yeah, because when we make
mistakes

156
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:04.207
we learn what we did wrong...

157
00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:07.124
...and that can help us learn
what's right.

158
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.957
But, how will we get good
grades?

159
00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.124
What do grades matter?

160
00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:13.999
We need good grades to graduate,

161
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.082
and so that our parents don't
get mad at us.

162
00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:18.457
That's all?

163
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.749
Fine, that's easy.

164
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.957
As of now, you all get a 10.

165
00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.082
At the end of the year, when you
get your report cards, you're

166
00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:30.875
all going to find there: your
10!

167
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:32.332
I promise.

168
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:33.499
Really. Got it?

169
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.207
Now we can get back to the
important stuff.

170
00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:40.875
Who wants to be wrong first?

171
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.208
Come on, who?

172
00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.208
No one?

173
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.040
Have you ever had a class like
that before?

174
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.749
I've never had a teacher like
that.

175
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.957
What were we supposed to
learn? - About boats, obviously.

176
00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.208
Do you think?

177
00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:07.665
- Walk with us, Romeo? - What?

178
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:09.999
Don't worry, I can keep a
secret.

179
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.540
No, it's just that...

180
00:15:12.541 --> 00:15:15.999
Have you noticed that Paloma
seems different this year?

181
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.875
Um, it's called puberty.

182
00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:24.208
Heavy, no? Could be real silver.

183
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:27.125
You can replace the mirror.

184
00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:29.208
Besides, I'm keeping it.

185
00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:31.416
What do you want for it?

186
00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:40.624
Do you think he meant it? -
Why would he lie about something

187
00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:43.040
like that?

188
00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:43.166
like that? Remember what he
said? He wants us to make mistakes.

189
00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:47.541
Remember what he said? He wants
us to make mistakes.

190
00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:51.457
If we don't have to be right,
it's okay if we're wrong,

191
00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:56.166
and if it's okay to be wrong, we
can't get a bad grade.

192
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.875
I've never had a 10 before.

193
00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.125
Papa, your nose.

194
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.082
It's nothing.

195
00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:29.083
Come help me unload.

196
00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:30.291
Ok.

197
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.915
Fifteen minutes of cartoons
while I make lunch,

198
00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:36.083
and then it's homework time.

199
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.290
Aren't you working the night
shift, mama?

200
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.416
What are you doing up?

201
00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:46.416
PREGNANCY TEST

202
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.125
Nico!

203
00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:52.540
The pretty boy.

204
00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:53.582
First day of school -

205
00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:54.207
How did it go, man?

206
00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.999
Well - Last year, they
suspended him on the first day,

207
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.040
right?

208
00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:00.249
It's not for him man, just like
his brother.

209
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.624
Can't sit still, always on the
go.

210
00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:03.999
That's my Carlitos.

211
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.665
Staring out the window,
doodling, getting in fights...

212
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:11.165
Anything but paying attention,
am I right?

213
00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:15.416
But it's ok, Nico. You got us to
take care of you.

214
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:19.208
You wanna learn from books...

215
00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:22.207
...or do you wanna learn from
"la vida"?

216
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:26.208
This is the real school right
here, no?

217
00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:32.583
- We better get going. - Word.

218
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.000
Let him carry it.

219
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.082
Mr. Juárez.

220
00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.165
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

221
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.040
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

222
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:07.124
Yeah, I was... uh...

223
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.124
I had a lot of rearranging to do
in my classroom.

224
00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:11.749
Yeah, I saw.

225
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.082
You have something against
furniture?

226
00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:17.208
No... just... some.

227
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.541
Like your desk, for instance.

228
00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:23.457
It's just I don't think I need a
desk.

229
00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:26.874
You have to have a desk. Every
teacher has to have one.

230
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:30.040
Is there some rule written that
says I have to have a desk?

231
00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:32.624
It's not the kind of rule that's
written,

232
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:35.124
but how will the students know
who's in charge?

233
00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:37.041
Who's the authority?

234
00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:38.791
Tell me -

235
00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:43.040
You turn your classroom into a
playground, what's next?

236
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:45.750
Turn the playground into a
classroom?

237
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.082
What's your story, professor?
What do you mean?

238
00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:55.999
This place, you know what they
call it?

239
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.082
"School of Punishment." -
Exactly.

240
00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:59.082
Yeah.

241
00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:02.040
Your name was the first on the
transfer list.

242
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.040
The only name, in fact.

243
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:07.124
You asked to come here.

244
00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:08.250
Why?

245
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.708
well...

246
00:20:11.125 --> 00:20:12.875
Maybe I'm crazy?

247
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.583
You're running from something.

248
00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:21.750
No, I just wanted to try
something different.

249
00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:23.750
Like what?

250
00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.040
I don't know.

251
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.916
I'm still trying to figure that
out.

252
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.665
Well, perhaps this is the place
to do it.

253
00:20:37.666 --> 00:20:42.875
After all, no one gives a damn
what happens here.

254
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:48.165
Just do me a favor, don't go
kicking any hornets' nests.

255
00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:51.416
No... why would I...

256
00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.708
No.

257
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:55.915
The desk...

258
00:20:55.916 --> 00:20:57.208
...stays inside.

259
00:20:58.208 --> 00:21:00.750
Help me push it back?

260
00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:04.208
C'mon...

261
00:21:06.083 --> 00:21:07.291
Hey...

262
00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:11.416
So... What's up with the
computer lab?

263
00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:25.957
They were installed four years
ago,

264
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:29.041
and two months later they were
stolen.

265
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:34.583
That was four years ago? -
Mhhm.

266
00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:43.165
There are no other computers
here?

267
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:46.416
The only one that works is in my
office.

268
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.125
Welcome to Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López, Mr. Juárez..

269
00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:37.041
THE MEGA YACHTS OF THE RICH AND
FAMOUS

270
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.875
What was that?

271
00:22:58.375 --> 00:23:00.708
What's this?

272
00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:03.125
I found it on the dump.

273
00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:06.125
You should've left it there.

274
00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:09.416
What use do we have for such
fantasies?

275
00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:53.416
Come in, come in.

276
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:57.207
Sit wherever you like, there are
no assigned seats here.

277
00:23:57.208 --> 00:24:00.125
In fact, you don't even need to
sit if you don't want to.

278
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.415
Hurry, come in!

279
00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:23.082
We're going to do amazing things
in here every day.

280
00:24:23.083 --> 00:24:25.583
but if you come late, you'll
miss it.

281
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.540
Have you heard the story of the
burro that fell into the well?

282
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.208
No?

283
00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:36.750
Then let me tell you...

284
00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:42.290
One day, a burro fell into a
deep well.

285
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:46.290
Miraculously, it wasn't hurt,
but it couldn't get out.

286
00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:48.582
The farmer who owned the donkey

287
00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:52.124
figured that rescuing it would
be very expensive,

288
00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:54.040
certainly more than the burro
was worth.

289
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:58.415
And since the well was dry and a
danger to his other animals,

290
00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:01.082
he decided he should bury them
both:

291
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.374
The burro and the well.

292
00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:05.999
So, he began to shovel dirt into
the well.

293
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.249
The dirt fell on the burro, who
cried out,

294
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.250
But the farmer kept on
shoveling.

295
00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:17.999
After a while, the burro fell
silent.

296
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.499
The farmer assumed the animal
was dead,

297
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.332
but he had to fill the well so
no one else would fall in.

298
00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:27.750
So, he kept shoveling.

299
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:34.207
Imagine his surprise when he
suddenly saw

300
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:38.708
the tips of two ears sticking
out of the well.

301
00:25:39.166 --> 00:25:40.915
He shoveled faster and faster,

302
00:25:40.916 --> 00:25:47.041
as the burro's head slowly
emerged, shaking off the dirt.

303
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:50.207
Instead of letting itself get
buried,

304
00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:53.165
the burro used all the dirt that
was thrown on it to step up and

305
00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:55.040
up

306
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:59.165
until the mound of dirt was high
enough

307
00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:02.916
that it could jump right out of
the well.

308
00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:08.290
From now, we are going to be
like that burro.

309
00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:11.165
No matter how much dirt gets
thrown at us, no matter how much

310
00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:13.082
shit rains down,

311
00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:15.915
we are not going to let it bury
us.

312
00:26:15.916 --> 00:26:19.124
We're going to shake it off, and
we're going to use it

313
00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:22.083
to become the very best students
in the world.

314
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.999
There IS one thing that can stop
you though

315
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.083
if you let it.

316
00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:34.750
It's you.

317
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:39.999
Now, I understand why you might
not

318
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.624
when there are kids your age in
the world

319
00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:46.957
who can solve formulas in
advanced calculus

320
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:51.207
or write symphonies, or even
build robots.

321
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:54.082
How could the students at José
Urbina ever do those kinds of

322
00:26:54.083 --> 00:26:55.790
things,

323
00:26:55.791 --> 00:27:00.040
if we don't have computers, the
Internet,

324
00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:03.166
Sometimes we don't even have
electricity.

325
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:07.249
But, you know what?

326
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.790
We don't need any of that. None
of it.

327
00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:14.583
What you need, what each of you
needs,

328
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:17.208
you already have.

329
00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:19.415
And it's called...

330
00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:21.541
Potential.

331
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:23.999
It's up to you whether you use
it or not.

332
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.916
I can't make you.

333
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.040
Neither can your parents.

334
00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:32.583
It's your responsibility to
decide if you want to use it,

335
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.583
and how you want to use it.

336
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:36.457
So let's do this:

337
00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:39.915
From now on, I'm not going to
decide what we learn;

338
00:27:39.916 --> 00:27:42.915
YOU will. All right?

339
00:27:42.916 --> 00:27:46.875
So now, tell me:

340
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:48.875
What do you want to learn?

341
00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:52.832
It can be anything, anything at
all.

342
00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:55.041
What do you want to learn?

343
00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:01.750
Oh, nothing.

344
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:03.916
No one? Nothing?

345
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.957
Perfect.

346
00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:07.291
Easy for me, then.

347
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.416
We'll just sit here then...

348
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.750
...and learn about nothing.

349
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.291
And if you want to, we can do
this all year.

350
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.708
What was that?

351
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:32.250
Who was it?

352
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.500
No one?

353
00:28:33.501 --> 00:28:37.790
On the count of three, I want
everyone to raise their pen.

354
00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:40.583
One, two, three!

355
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:45.332
Come here.

356
00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:47.915
Yes, you in the back.

357
00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:50.291
Yes, you. Come.

358
00:28:56.375 --> 00:28:59.249
- What's your name? - Nico.

359
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.124
I also used to be the class
clown, Nico.

360
00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:04.207
I was always punished.

361
00:29:04.208 --> 00:29:06.875
I'll give you a piece of advice:

362
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:09.041
Don't ever change.

363
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:26.541
Yes?

364
00:29:26.542 --> 00:29:29.207
No need to raise your hand.
What's your name?

365
00:29:29.208 --> 00:29:31.165
- Donovan. - Yes, Donovan?

366
00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:35.750
I'd like to keep learning about
boats and ships.

367
00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:42.291
Good, anyone think more about
our boats from yesterday?

368
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:48.707
I realized that sometimes people
are going to die

369
00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:50.999
and there's nothing we can do
about it.

370
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.040
And that's life.

371
00:29:52.041 --> 00:29:56.207
Whoa, heavy. "There's nothing we
can do."

372
00:29:56.208 --> 00:30:00.207
So, we should just let them die?

373
00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:01.165
- Yes? - My name is Lupe.

374
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:03.665
You don't have to raise your
hand.

375
00:30:03.666 --> 00:30:06.665
I don't agree that there's
nothing we can do about it.

376
00:30:06.666 --> 00:30:09.999
I think you need to do as much
as you can.

377
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.125
You need to do as much as you
can for as many as you can.

378
00:30:15.083 --> 00:30:17.957
Very good, very good.

379
00:30:17.958 --> 00:30:20.165
You just said the same thing

380
00:30:20.166 --> 00:30:23.499
as one of the world's greatest
philosophers.

381
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.165
His name is John Stuart Mill.

382
00:30:27.166 --> 00:30:29.165
Maybe you could be a
philosopher.

383
00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.957
What's a "philosopher"?

384
00:30:30.958 --> 00:30:34.875
It's someone who studies
philosophy.

385
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:38.082
Which is a way to explore,

386
00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:43.207
or talk about life's deepest,
most complicated questions,

387
00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.624
which can be very hard to
understand.

388
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:47.999
and that helps us figure out
right from wrong.

389
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.124
But I still want to know why a
boat floats.

390
00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:51.208
But I still want to know
why a boat floats. Oh, right.

391
00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:52.082
Oh, right.

392
00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:55.540
Have you thought about why the
boat would sink if the director

393
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.957
got on?

394
00:30:57.958 --> 00:31:00.165
'Cause he's a fat ass.

395
00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:01.165
Good job!

396
00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:03.957
You didn't raise your hand, well
done!

397
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:05.707
Very good, thanks.

398
00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:09.416
Tell me, Nico, why would the
boat sink because he's fat?

399
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:13.665
Maybe because he's too heavy?

400
00:31:13.666 --> 00:31:17.040
Did you know a fat person floats
in water better

401
00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:20.875
than a muscular person that
weighs the same?

402
00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:21.832
No?

403
00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:24.875
Can anyone tell me why that
might happen?

404
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.832
Why?

405
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:28.874
It's a tough one, but I know you
can do it.

406
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:31.249
Think about it. Think, think,
think.

407
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.999
Who wants to take a guess? Or,
how about this?

408
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.040
Why if I blow up a balloon,

409
00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:41.125
it falls through the air, but
floats on water?

410
00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:46.165
Remember a fat person floats
better

411
00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:50.041
than a muscular person who
weighs the same.

412
00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:51.165
Why?

413
00:31:51.166 --> 00:31:52.874
Because they have different
sizes?

414
00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:56.124
Ah, so then it's the size.
Maybe.

415
00:31:56.125 --> 00:31:59.499
What if I take a bowling ball
that is the same size as my

416
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.415
balloon,

417
00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:03.915
and drop them both on water?

418
00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:05.957
The bowling ball would sink,
it's heavier.

419
00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:09.207
- And the balloon would float. -
But, how?

420
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:11.207
If they're the same size?

421
00:32:11.208 --> 00:32:14.040
So, is it the size, or the
weight?

422
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:16.416
I'll give you a clue.

423
00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:20.416
It has to do with the way
fractions work.

424
00:32:22.458 --> 00:32:24.665
That's precisely what we were
going to talk about today.

425
00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:27.874
Fractions, division, and
remainders.

426
00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:29.707
Alright let's see...

427
00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:31.874
Remember the boat game?

428
00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:35.250
Tell me, what were the
remainders.

429
00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:37.957
Think about it.

430
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:41.082
The passengers who didn't fit in
the boat?

431
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:42.040
Exactly!

432
00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:45.415
The passengers who couldn't fit
in the boat and drowned.

433
00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:47.040
Well done!

434
00:32:47.041 --> 00:32:48.416
Wow.

435
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.540
You're so smart that, honestly,
I don't think that you even need

436
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:55.749
me here.

437
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.208
So... I'm going to go get a
drink...

438
00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.999
...and be back in 30 minutes.

439
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.208
I bet by the time I get back
you'll have all the answers.

440
00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:09.082
Anyone want anything? No?

441
00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:10.750
I'll be right back.

442
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:32.749
- Muscle is heavier than fat. -
How do you know that?

443
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.415
My mom works at a butcher shop.

444
00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:37.499
A kilo of meat looks like this,
and a kilo of fat like this.

445
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.540
Maybe there's air in the fat and
that's why it floats.

446
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:43.749
So if they weigh the same, the
fat guy should be bigger.

447
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.957
But what does it have to do with
size,

448
00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:48.290
if a big balloon floats on
water, but a pebble will sink.

449
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.165
- Because it has air in it. -
Yes,

450
00:33:50.166 --> 00:33:53.749
but I I'm sure a giant balloon
would weigh more than a pebble.

451
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:56.124
So that's it then, a fat person
floats better because they have

452
00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:58.416
more air inside.

453
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.166
Like Director Chucho.

454
00:34:13.541 --> 00:34:14.874
You must be the new guy.

455
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:16.999
I'm Arturo... Mr. García.

456
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.582
Hello, I'm Sergio.

457
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:21.790
Is everything okay, Sergio?

458
00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:24.125
Uh, yeah, I think so.

459
00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:28.208
The kids are getting the best of
you.

460
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.874
That's one way to put it.

461
00:34:30.875 --> 00:34:34.082
You can't let them see your
weaknesses.

462
00:34:34.083 --> 00:34:37.832
The key is to discipline them
from the beginning.

463
00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:40.875
They have to know who has the
authority.

464
00:34:42.416 --> 00:34:46.708
Hmm, I think maybe it should be
exactly the opposite.

465
00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.875
Well, good luck with that.

466
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:53.583
Thanks.

467
00:34:57.583 --> 00:35:01.750
You know the most powerful words
a teacher can say?

468
00:35:02.625 --> 00:35:04.207
I don't know.

469
00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.916
Ah, you do!

470
00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:12.082
Shouldn't you be teaching right
now?

471
00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:14.125
Better I let them learn.

472
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:24.290
Mr. Juárez, everything all
right?

473
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.040
Sergio, just call me Sergio.

474
00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:30.082
Shouldn't you be in your class
right now, MR. JUÁREZ?

475
00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:32.124
Yeah, yeah. So?

476
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:33.499
The kids are good.

477
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.665
Don't worry, in fact they may be
too good.

478
00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:39.665
This is the school's only
computer? - Yes.

479
00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:42.082
May I use it for a minute? -
What? Now?

480
00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:46.290
Yeah, it's just that these kids
are incredible.

481
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.290
I can barely keep up with them.

482
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:51.707
I would've thought that a former
middle school teacher

483
00:35:51.708 --> 00:35:54.916
would be qualified to teach
sixth graders.

484
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.332
Yeah... me, too.

485
00:35:57.333 --> 00:36:01.415
It's just that they're... moving
so fast.

486
00:36:01.416 --> 00:36:05.749
Do you mind if I just...? Come
on, only for a sec -

487
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.124
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

488
00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:09.082
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

489
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.207
Three minutes. Out.

490
00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:14.041
I'm sorry, Director. Daniel
won't stop crying.

491
00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:18.208
What's wrong, little one? Do you
like clowns?

492
00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:22.208
Look! A clown's nose.

493
00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:57.165
What are you laughing at? What's
your name?

494
00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:59.583
Hey, come back! Wait!

495
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:17.165
So, what did we learn?

496
00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:19.124
Have we figured out the problem?

497
00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:22.000
FLOTATION = WEIGHT / SIZE

498
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:31.040
We think that if a fat man and a
muscular guy weigh the same,

499
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:34.415
then the fat man would be
bigger,

500
00:37:34.416 --> 00:37:36.999
because muscle is heavier than
fat.

501
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.125
Exactly! Well done!

502
00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.124
What? What's wrong?

503
00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:47.290
We were sure that if two things
are the same size,

504
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:50.624
then the lighter would float
better.

505
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:53.208
Ha! You're both right!

506
00:37:54.208 --> 00:37:55.749
How can that be?

507
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.499
It's called an inversely
proportional relationship,

508
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.500
and you figured out both parts
of it.

509
00:38:02.583 --> 00:38:05.332
What we were calling
'flotation',

510
00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:08.332
is the concept of density.

511
00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:12.249
Where density equals mass over
volume.

512
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.374
Mass is another word for weight,

513
00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:16.249
and volume is another word for
size.

514
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.082
and volume is another word for
size.

515
00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:22.207
As the mass increases, we get
higher density,

516
00:38:22.208 --> 00:38:26.041
but if volume increases, we get
lower density.

517
00:38:26.458 --> 00:38:28.125
Got it?

518
00:38:31.708 --> 00:38:34.125
In Spanish, please!

519
00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:04.457
Mr. Director, won't you join
us? - What are you doing?!

520
00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:07.750
- Isn't it cool? - I mean, why
are you out here?

521
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:10.582
It was your idea, remember?

522
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:13.207
Turn the playground into a
classroom.

523
00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.999
You're supposed to be teaching
natural science,

524
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.332
Your lesson plan today, if I am
not mistaken, should be on the

525
00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:19.290
Solar System.

526
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:21.540
That was the plan, but right now
they're more interested in

527
00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:23.916
physics.

528
00:39:24.541 --> 00:39:25.874
- Physics? - Yeah.

529
00:39:25.875 --> 00:39:27.707
As far as I know, there's
nothing about physics on the

530
00:39:27.708 --> 00:39:30.166
ENLACE test.

531
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:32.749
The ENLACE, sir. Come on.

532
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:36.875
Teaching to that test isn't
going to help these kids.

533
00:39:38.208 --> 00:39:40.790
What does it really even
measure?

534
00:39:40.791 --> 00:39:42.207
Teachers.

535
00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:45.208
Did you ever think of that?

536
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.040
Come here.

537
00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:52.915
What have you learned about
physics today?

538
00:39:52.916 --> 00:39:54.957
Um... not much.

539
00:39:54.958 --> 00:39:57.999
I mean I understand the 'reverse
relationship' of density -

540
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.040
- Inversely proportional. -
Yeah, that.

541
00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:04.582
Inversely proportional...
between mass and volume

542
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:07.040
and how that changes density...

543
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:11.624
But how those huge metal ships
are able to float...

544
00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:12.832
I just don't know.

545
00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:14.624
But neither did you.

546
00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:18.415
Well, uhm, that's a tough one.

547
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.832
- It's difficult. - I see...

548
00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:22.624
So, who is more dense, then?

549
00:40:22.625 --> 00:40:25.208
You, or the Director?

550
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.540
Uh, I'm sure that...

551
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:32.750
the Director is far, far less
dense than I am.

552
00:40:32.958 --> 00:40:34.499
You like to push it, huh?

553
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.832
No, not at all.

554
00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:41.416
Although he has a lot more mass
and much more volume,

555
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:44.249
To know who is more or less
dense, we would have to measure

556
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.583
ourselves.

557
00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:48.540
How could we do that?

558
00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:51.124
If mass is weight, couldn't we
just weigh you?

559
00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:55.040
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?

560
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:55.166
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?
Long by wide by high.

561
00:40:55.167 --> 00:40:56.915
Long by wide by high.

562
00:40:56.916 --> 00:41:00.040
Length by width by height, but
very good.

563
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:04.207
That works for a regular object,
like a cube.

564
00:41:04.208 --> 00:41:07.040
What about an irregular object,
like a person?

565
00:41:07.041 --> 00:41:11.165
What's the Director's width? Is
it this...

566
00:41:11.166 --> 00:41:12.750
or this?

567
00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:17.624
Think about it. You're soooo
close.

568
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:19.374
C'mon you've got this.

569
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:22.750
You have the answer right in
front of you!

570
00:41:31.125 --> 00:41:34.166
Oh, Paloma. One second.

571
00:41:35.291 --> 00:41:38.540
I saw your notebook. You know
all the answers,

572
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.708
Why didn't you share them with
your classmates?

573
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.290
Look, you have real ability and

574
00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:48.708
Aerospace engineer?

575
00:41:49.333 --> 00:41:50.040
Pardon?

576
00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:53.624
You told Lupe she could be a
philosopher.

577
00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:57.416
Do you think I could be an
aerospace engineer?

578
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.290
You want to design spaceships?

579
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:06.916
Well, several astronauts were
first aerospace engineers.

580
00:42:08.958 --> 00:42:10.499
Whoa...

581
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.916
Astronaut.

582
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:14.250
Okay.

583
00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:18.250
I guess we have our work cut out
for us.

584
00:42:19.083 --> 00:42:20.165
Paloma...

585
00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:21.332
If you could try to share a
little bit more with your

586
00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:23.665
classmates,

587
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:26.708
there's a lot we could learn
from you.

588
00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:29.583
Do you think you can try?

589
00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:39.041
Why are we going the wrong way?

590
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.540
Can I help you? Um...

591
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:52.082
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

592
00:42:52.083 --> 00:42:53.750
Philosophy?

593
00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:56.749
Or philosophers?

594
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.541
Philosophers?

595
00:42:59.416 --> 00:43:02.124
Maybe John Stuart Mill?

596
00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:02.915
Who?

597
00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:03.333
John Stuart -

598
00:43:03.334 --> 00:43:05.874
Those are college subjects,

599
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:08.415
I don't know why you'd have any
need to read stuff like that at

600
00:43:08.416 --> 00:43:10.875
your age?

601
00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:14.125
Okay, well, thanks.

602
00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:19.416
Is that what you wanted?

603
00:43:20.791 --> 00:43:22.750
Watcha got there?

604
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.207
Did you know you can burn things
with that using sunlight?

605
00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:29.707
- I did. - Yeah, who doesn't,
right?

606
00:43:29.708 --> 00:43:33.083
What a couple! The nerd and the
hoodlum.

607
00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:41.041
Go to hell.

608
00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:46.457
- Afternoon, Director. - Good
afternoon, Mr. García.

609
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:48.999
This new guy, Mr. Juárez...

610
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.165
What do you know about him? -
Well...

611
00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:56.082
I checked his evaluations, his
references, the usual.

612
00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:58.875
- Is that all? - Yeah.

613
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.040
That's interesting,

614
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:02.416
because...

615
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.916
I made a few calls...

616
00:44:18.083 --> 00:44:20.832
Where were you? I was worried.

617
00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:24.166
I guess I've been moving slower
today.

618
00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:32.499
What was that for?

619
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.875
I don't know. I had a good day.

620
00:44:37.166 --> 00:44:38.875
Come on.

621
00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:44.208
It floats!

622
00:44:47.125 --> 00:44:49.291
Ok, you won.

623
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.208
But why do you think it floats?

624
00:45:42.583 --> 00:45:45.832
Mr. Juárez, I hope you don't
mind.

625
00:45:45.833 --> 00:45:48.290
Not at all, come in.

626
00:45:48.291 --> 00:45:50.416
Please, come in.

627
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:55.875
- How are you? This way. - I'm
fine.

628
00:45:56.208 --> 00:45:58.207
Look, before this goes any
further,

629
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:01.165
I need to know exactly what
you're up to.

630
00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:04.874
So, I guess it isn't true that
"no one gives a damn.”

631
00:46:04.875 --> 00:46:07.875
It's my responsibility to look
out for my kids.

632
00:46:08.166 --> 00:46:10.125
"My kids..."

633
00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:12.040
Listen.

634
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:14.290
I called your old school.

635
00:46:14.291 --> 00:46:18.165
They told me about an "incident"
you had there.

636
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:21.707
I had an episode in front of the
students.

637
00:46:21.708 --> 00:46:26.040
A kind of existential crisis,
let's say.

638
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:27.665
I'm fine.

639
00:46:27.666 --> 00:46:29.457
What else do you want to know?

640
00:46:29.458 --> 00:46:30.540
Nothing, nothing.

641
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:32.040
I'm only trying to understand
what it is you're trying to do

642
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:34.082
here.

643
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.082
I mean, what's your method?

644
00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:38.083
No, no...

645
00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:41.583
I don't have a method exactly.

646
00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:42.665
I don't understand.

647
00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:44.582
Hey, can I offer you a beer?

648
00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:48.750
No, I was just - - Please, I'm
inviting you in to my home.

649
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.041
Honey? We have a guest.

650
00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:53.374
- Good afternoon. - Hello.

651
00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.832
This is my wife, Laura. He's my
boss.

652
00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:59.208
Oh, I thought I was the boss.

653
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:01.707
Nice to meet you.

654
00:47:01.708 --> 00:47:03.124
I'm Chucho.

655
00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:05.708
And this is our little surprise.

656
00:47:06.708 --> 00:47:08.874
He can be a bit impertinent.

657
00:47:08.875 --> 00:47:10.457
Yeah, I've noticed.

658
00:47:10.458 --> 00:47:14.082
I'm going to put the baby down.
Make yourself at home.

659
00:47:14.083 --> 00:47:16.708
Thank you. Excuse me.

660
00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:23.583
You asked why I came here.

661
00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:26.582
"José Urbina López Elementary
School

662
00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:30.125
receives... grant for a computer
lab."

663
00:47:30.541 --> 00:47:33.165
That's dated eight months ago.

664
00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:35.290
It says the funds were already
disbursed.

665
00:47:35.291 --> 00:47:39.750
They were disbursed all right,
but they never got to us.

666
00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:42.874
- You know how it goes. - Yeah.

667
00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:46.291
"They'll be there tomorrow, no
need to press."

668
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.332
In Matamoros you don't press
more if you know what's good for

669
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:50.290
you.

670
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:53.250
Of course, yeah, sure.

671
00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:57.374
Why the obsession?

672
00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:01.583
We grew up without computer labs
and we turned out fine.

673
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.207
You have one of those phones
that go online?

674
00:48:06.208 --> 00:48:07.332
Yeah, why?

675
00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:10.250
Can I borrow it? I want to show
you something.

676
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.124
By the way,

677
00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:20.499
there's a girl in my class,
Paloma Noyola.

678
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.749
What do you know about her? -
Not much. Quiet...

679
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.125
Could apply herself more.

680
00:48:26.583 --> 00:48:29.708
- That's it? - Yeah, why?

681
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.082
- This is the last of it. -
Let's see...

682
00:48:48.083 --> 00:48:50.957
18 kilos of iron at 55 cents per
kilo,

683
00:48:50.958 --> 00:48:52.999
3 kilos of aluminum, at 11 pesos
per kilo,

684
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.874
4 kilos of bronze at 2.75,

685
00:48:54.875 --> 00:48:57.415
and 3 kilos of copper at 26
pesos.

686
00:48:57.416 --> 00:49:00.125
The total comes to 105 pesos.

687
00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:07.665
Let's go.

688
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:09.208
He shorted you.

689
00:49:09.583 --> 00:49:10.665
What's that?

690
00:49:10.666 --> 00:49:12.708
Papa, he's cheating you.

691
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:18.166
Excuse me? I think you counted
wrong.

692
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.083
It should be 131.9 pesos.

693
00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:24.707
Rounded up, 132 pesos.

694
00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:28.250
Would you check again? Of
course...

695
00:49:31.416 --> 00:49:36.958
Look at that... you're right.
It's 131.90 pesos.

696
00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:39.916
Sorry. Must've hit the wrong
key.

697
00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.166
Nico!

698
00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:57.290
What happened?!

699
00:49:57.291 --> 00:50:00.124
You didn't come to Nacho's.

700
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:01.665
I'm sorry, I just -

701
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.082
Where's your backpack?

702
00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:04.249
It's inside.

703
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.708
You need to think, Nico!

704
00:50:29.958 --> 00:50:31.583
It's okay.

705
00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:37.250
I'll be fine. You sure?

706
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:42.416
What are you doing?

707
00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:50.208
Ever since I can remember, this
thing has been here, rotting

708
00:50:51.125 --> 00:50:54.374
Think you can fix it?

709
00:50:54.375 --> 00:50:55.832
Maybe.

710
00:50:55.833 --> 00:50:59.207
I've been learning about
flotation at school.

711
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:01.624
Flotation? Really?

712
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:04.707
- How will you get it to float?
- Well...

713
00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:07.832
First, I have to keep the water
out of it.

714
00:51:07.833 --> 00:51:12.165
- Duh, obviously! - No, what I
meant is...

715
00:51:12.427 --> 00:51:17.384
I need to seal all the holes
because if water gets in...

716
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:20.541
What?

717
00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:23.040
Maybe... maybe that's it.

718
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:26.124
Even though it's not sealed like
a balloon,

719
00:51:26.125 --> 00:51:29.290
it uses the air in this space,
somehow,

720
00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:32.249
so that it makes the boat
less dense than the water!

721
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.583
Yeah! That could be it!

722
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.165
Look at you...

723
00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:38.583
Getting all scientific!

724
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:46.500
What is it?

725
00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:50.249
Do you think I could stay in
school, at least for a little

726
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.583
longer?

727
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.082
Jeez, I don't know, man.

728
00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:58.708
Let me talk to Nacho, okay? -
All right.

729
00:52:33.916 --> 00:52:37.249
You're trying to tell me your
entire approach is based on

730
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.875
some... YouTube video?

731
00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:43.124
Yeah, pretty much.

732
00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:46.708
So you said to hell with the
curriculum?

733
00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:49.416
Yeah, pretty much.

734
00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:55.915
We'll get it all covered
eventually, but,

735
00:52:55.916 --> 00:52:59.750
When they want to, when it's
their idea.

736
00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:02.957
Although, after what I saw
today,

737
00:53:02.958 --> 00:53:05.416
I'm not even sure they need me.

738
00:53:07.708 --> 00:53:09.999
If they had computers,

739
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.749
they'd learn everything by
themselves.

740
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.208
Oh my god.

741
00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:20.583
Here.

742
00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:24.040
Did you ever teach?

743
00:53:24.041 --> 00:53:26.499
It's a requirement to become a
Director.

744
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.875
So then you remember why you
decided to become a teacher, no?

745
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.208
That was a long time ago.

746
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:37.208
What was the name of that
teacher?

747
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.125
Mrs. Carmona.

748
00:53:45.166 --> 00:53:47.750
Mine was Mr. Chávez.

749
00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:51.208
Profe Juan Antonio Chávez.

750
00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:55.165
He told me I could change the
world,

751
00:53:55.166 --> 00:53:57.083
and I believed him.

752
00:53:58.166 --> 00:54:00.749
I remember how I gave him a hug
up there, in front of everyone,

753
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.665
at my graduation.

754
00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:06.541
When I started teaching my kids
would come up to hug me, too.

755
00:54:07.041 --> 00:54:12.041
but over time, each year there
were fewer and fewer,

756
00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:17.208
until last year, not one.

757
00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:21.040
Kids have changed

758
00:54:21.041 --> 00:54:22.875
No.

759
00:54:23.333 --> 00:54:26.416
Kids will always be kids.

760
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.207
The world has changed, Mr.
Juárez.

761
00:54:35.208 --> 00:54:37.957
Yes, but we haven't.

762
00:54:37.958 --> 00:54:41.082
Nothing in education has changed
in the last 100 years.

763
00:54:41.083 --> 00:54:44.957
Nothing. From the school bell to
the uniforms.

764
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:48.915
"Be quiet! Stand in line! Raise
your hand!"

765
00:54:48.916 --> 00:54:52.415
We're training these kids to be
cogs in a machine

766
00:54:52.416 --> 00:54:56.583
whose only purpose is to keep
running for its own sake.

767
00:54:57.666 --> 00:55:00.124
And if it chews them up and
spits them out,

768
00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:04.124
it's because they didn't follow
the rules of our little game.

769
00:55:04.125 --> 00:55:07.749
But these kids are so much
smarter than that.

770
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:12.291
They know full well the machine
is obsolete.

771
00:55:12.916 --> 00:55:17.416
So they tune out, they drift
away...

772
00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:20.583
...and we lose them.

773
00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:25.291
You asked me why I came here.

774
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:31.166
I don't want to lose any more
kids.

775
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.708
Not one more.

776
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:38.665
Aren't you a little old to be
such an idealist?

777
00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:42.083
I'm a little too old to be a new
Dad again.

778
00:55:49.416 --> 00:55:53.750
- Okay, Mr. Juárez... - Sergio,
just Sergio.

779
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.208
Call me Sergio.

780
00:55:56.541 --> 00:55:58.750
Okay, Sergio.

781
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.165
I'm going to give you a
chance...

782
00:56:02.166 --> 00:56:04.750
...just don't piss it away, eh?

783
00:56:08.125 --> 00:56:10.457
Oh, actually...

784
00:56:10.458 --> 00:56:13.416
Can I ask you for one more tiny
favor?

785
00:56:15.333 --> 00:56:17.708
It's ready, get in.

786
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.208
Mom, time to get up.

787
00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:32.416
What's going on? Come on, help
me out here.

788
00:56:35.375 --> 00:56:36.374
Good evening.

789
00:56:36.375 --> 00:56:39.124
Breakfast is on the table,
coffee's ready.

790
00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:40.499
Thank you.

791
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.582
All right, in you go.

792
00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:47.083
No! What are you doing!? You
didn't take off your underwear.

793
00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:51.124
Hey...

794
00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:53.166
Get out, get out!

795
00:56:57.833 --> 00:57:00.250
Uhh, get back in...

796
00:57:09.416 --> 00:57:11.082
How much?

797
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:14.125
- Seven centimeters. - Yeah!

798
00:57:14.583 --> 00:57:16.332
Next. Next!

799
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.416
Wait, I changed my mind!

800
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:24.125
Ok, I'm here.

801
00:57:26.166 --> 00:57:28.458
"Tiny favor."

802
00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:32.749
It's for the kids, remember? -
For the kids.

803
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:35.915
For the kids... This is for the
kids!

804
00:57:35.916 --> 00:57:37.875
For the kids!

805
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:39.875
For the kids!

806
00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:46.208
I'm going, I'm going.

807
00:57:54.666 --> 00:57:56.875
- Ten Centimeters. - Ten
centimeters!

808
00:58:03.041 --> 00:58:03.541
Sergio is more dense!

809
00:58:03.542 --> 00:58:04.750
Sergio is more dense!

810
00:58:29.916 --> 00:58:34.749
We can build a water heater, or
an oven...

811
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.040
I have an idea! Check this out.

812
00:58:38.041 --> 00:58:41.125
- We're going to win! - Hell,
yeah!

813
00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:05.499
Hi, there. Can I help you?

814
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.582
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

815
00:59:08.583 --> 00:59:09.415
Of course.

816
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:12.208
Are you interested in any area
in particular?

817
00:59:13.791 --> 00:59:16.999
Metaphysics? Ontology?
Epistemology?

818
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.208
Morality? Logic? Aesthetics?

819
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:25.125
Marlene, can you give me a hand?

820
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:32.583
Here you go.

821
00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:49.250
- This never happens! - Give it
a whack.

822
00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:54.583
Sorry.

823
01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:01.957
Over here.

824
01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.916
None of that is usable. Take all
you want.

825
01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:08.750
Careful not to cut yourself.
Good luck.

826
01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.915
We believe gravity is that which
makes us fall,

827
01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.707
but it only seems like we're
falling.

828
01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:21.415
When we're actually being pulled
towards Earth,

829
01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:24.749
because its mass is so enormous
compared to ours.

830
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.415
It's the same reason why the sun
pulls the Earth.

831
01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:29.874
Then, if the sun is pulling the
Earth how come we don't just

832
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.665
crash into the sun?

833
01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:35.624
Because the orbit is the exact
spot where a planet is caught

834
01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:37.040
between falling towards
something and falling away from

835
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.124
it.

836
01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:42.374
So, the entire universe, all of
us, all the time,

837
01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:45.750
are actually just falling
through space?

838
01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:49.125
- Yeah, something like that. -
Cool!

839
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.249
- Hey watch where you point
that. - Sorry!

840
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.707
Okay, so...

841
01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:04.166
Everyone knows that a magnifying
glass can burn things.

842
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.915
This is unfocused light
reflected onto my hand.

843
01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:13.875
But what happens if we focus it?

844
01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:25.625
Tada!

845
01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.415
I hope you enjoyed our Solar
Death Ray!

846
01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:32.124
If you think that was cool,
You'll like this even more...

847
01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:35.208
Watch what it does to this
bottle of gasoline!

848
01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:45.207
Rotation!

849
01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:48.875
Come on, everyone! Let me see
you rotating!

850
01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.790
Rotation!

851
01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.208
Now revolution!

852
01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:31.416
JOSÉ URBINA ELEMENTARY RECEIVES
GRANT FOR COMPUTER LAB

853
01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:57.041
Why so early, Nico?

854
01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.208
Everything ok?

855
01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:03.291
All right, tell me.

856
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:08.415
You said we could ask you
anything, right?

857
01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.082
Yup.

858
01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:12.249
And there is no question that's
too weird or that we shouldn't

859
01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.207
ask, right?

860
01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.208
That's right.

861
01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:19.790
Okay, so... here's my question.

862
01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:21.250
Shoot.

863
01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:28.416
How do I get a girl to like me?

864
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:30.999
- See! - No, no!

865
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.582
It's a very good question.

866
01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:36.750
A very important question, in
fact.

867
01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:39.125
I'm serious, but...

868
01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:43.499
like all big questions, there's
no one answer.

869
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.790
Dammit.

870
01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:48.541
Because there's not only one
kind of girl.

871
01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:53.040
What kind of girl are we talking
about?

872
01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:55.165
That's the thing.

873
01:03:55.166 --> 01:03:58.499
She's just so smart, and I'm so
dumb -

874
01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.875
Hey, hey.

875
01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:02.124
None of that.

876
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:03.915
Every time I try to impress her,
I end up saying something

877
01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.832
stupid.

878
01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:08.040
Well there's your problem!

879
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:08.541
What?

880
01:04:08.542 --> 01:04:13.374
You're trying to impress her,
show her how great you are.

881
01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.082
That works with some women,
but...

882
01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:18.416
You're not interested in just
any girl, are you?

883
01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.540
There you go.

884
01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.790
With a girl like that,

885
01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:25.291
you gotta show her how great she
is, not you.

886
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.708
Support her, encourage her...

887
01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.708
Because she is going places.

888
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.040
Especially someone like Paloma.

889
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.083
- How...? - Eh, it was pretty
obvious.

890
01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.250
Look.

891
01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:47.416
I was going to give this to her,

892
01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:51.125
but I think maybe you should.

893
01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:58.416
Tell her "look what I found and
it made me think of you."

894
01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:03.583
How come you know all this
stuff?

895
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:08.750
Remember when I said we learn
from our mistakes?

896
01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:12.875
I've made a lot of them.

897
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.540
Take care of it now, you don't
want to lose it -

898
01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:19.416
No!

899
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:25.875
Sorry, it's just that... I keep
important stuff in here.

900
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.374
Let me see that bag, Nico.

901
01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:35.790
It just has my school supplies,
a gift from my brother...

902
01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:37.750
- That's all. - Nico!

903
01:05:40.416 --> 01:05:43.082
No, no, no, - Nico, give it -

904
01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:46.208
Please, we never open it.
Please!

905
01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:50.458
Give me that bag.

906
01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.541
If they find out, they'll kill
me.

907
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:57.875
Please, I'm begging you. Don't
open it.

908
01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.250
Give it to me, Nico.

909
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.708
Will you?

910
01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.083
What?

911
01:06:36.916 --> 01:06:38.875
If I open this bag,

912
01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:43.707
am I going to find something no
12-year-old should have,

913
01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.041
much less bring to school?

914
01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:48.208
I don't know.

915
01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.416
Maybe.

916
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:54.250
Nico, if I find something like
that,

917
01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:58.165
I'll have no choice but to
report it,

918
01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.915
and from then on everything will
get much more complicated for

919
01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:02.208
you

920
01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.540
So what are you going to do?

921
01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:09.208
That's what you have to tell me.

922
01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:17.875
Good morning.

923
01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:19.624
I looked up your questions,

924
01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:22.875
they're up front with your names
on them.

925
01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:29.915
Nico, I know you've had a lot of
catching up to do,

926
01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:34.583
but out of all my students,
you've made the most progress.

927
01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:38.165
Remember what I said at the top
of the year about taking charge

928
01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:40.750
of your lives?

929
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.707
You have to decide which
direction you want your life to

930
01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:44.750
go.

931
01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:47.750
Do you want it to go this way?

932
01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.083
or this way.

933
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.208
You can't have both.

934
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.332
Almost on time.

935
01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.540
At least you're making progress.

936
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:07.457
Today, we're having Rosita's
dance presentation.

937
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.499
It's going to be fantastic.

938
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.416
But before we begin, it's game
time.

939
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.082
Pay attention.

940
01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:19.790
There was a famous mathematician
named

941
01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:23.040
Carl Friedrich Gauss.

942
01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:25.915
In 1777, when he was a kid,

943
01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:27.999
his teacher wanted to keep all
his students busy,

944
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.083
so he asked them to add up all
the numbers from 1 to 100.

945
01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:38.165
This was supposed to take them
hours,

946
01:08:38.166 --> 01:08:42.082
but Gauss answered immediately.

947
01:08:42.083 --> 01:08:45.541
Can anyone tell me how he did
it?

948
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.250
Uh, Team 2? Paloma?

949
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.374
Is it...

950
01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.750
5050?

951
01:09:06.083 --> 01:09:08.291
How did you get that?

952
01:09:09.208 --> 01:09:14.458
I added 100 plus 1... 101.

953
01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:17.707
99 plus 2, 101.

954
01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:20.165
98 plus 3, 101.

955
01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:23.875
In total, there are 50 pairs of
101.

956
01:09:28.708 --> 01:09:31.083
Team 2 gets a point.

957
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.583
I need to report an incident.

958
01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:46.750
- Are we done here? - It seems
we are.

959
01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:49.916
What happened?

960
01:09:52.083 --> 01:09:55.291
A student may have brought
contraband to school.

961
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.499
"May have brought"?

962
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.750
Yeah, I'm not certain.

963
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:03.000
Who's the offender?

964
01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:05.083
Me.

965
01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:06.500
Come again?

966
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:09.457
Yes, maybe I should've reported
the student.

967
01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:11.999
Isn't that what you're doing
right now?

968
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.082
Yes.

969
01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:13.208
Yes.
No.

970
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.875
No.

971
01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.708
No, because I'm reporting
myself.

972
01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:18.875
For what?

973
01:10:18.876 --> 01:10:23.124
For failing to report something
that... Maybe I should have.

974
01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.874
I chose not to look in their
bag.

975
01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:27.874
So, who is the student?

976
01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.541
No, I can't tell you that.

977
01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:34.207
Because technically, there
hasn't been any violation.

978
01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:38.374
And I want to give them an
opportunity.

979
01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:42.083
I just... I'm not sure I did the
right thing.

980
01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:46.250
This seems more like a
confession than a report.

981
01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:49.832
I didn't do it just for him. Or
her.

982
01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.915
It's just that the whole class
is engaging,

983
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.582
the method is working.

984
01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:58.707
If I report this student now, I
could lose everyone's trust.

985
01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:03.250
It would ruin the whole thing,
and I don't want to lose them.

986
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.583
So what am I supposed to do?

987
01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:11.291
Tell me I did the right thing?

988
01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.374
Sergio,

989
01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:18.457
the only thing that you did...

990
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:21.208
was confuse the hell out of me.

991
01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:29.457
Can I walk you home?

992
01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.082
Don't you live by the beach?

993
01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.290
Yes, but I'm taking the long way
today.

994
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:38.041
Besides, you'll be a lot safer
with me...

995
01:11:38.666 --> 01:11:40.416
Suit yourself.

996
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.957
You can build your own rocket,

997
01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:47.582
and you get to experience a
zero-gravity chamber.

998
01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:51.082
And look, there's also a
simulation of a failed launch,

999
01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.332
where you have to regain
control.

1000
01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:54.374
And get this:

1001
01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:58.999
Three students have become real
astronauts.

1002
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.290
Sergio told me that - - Wait a
second.

1003
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:03.750
Sergio gave you this?

1004
01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:11.083
Wanna see something?

1005
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.665
- Are you okay, Papa? - Yes,
don't worry.

1006
01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:23.875
I'm just a little beat today.

1007
01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:26.999
Who's this? Good afternoon. I'm
Nico.

1008
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.082
We're partners on a science
project.

1009
01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:33.125
Let me take my bag inside, I'll
be right back.

1010
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.416
Eh, how are you, sir?

1011
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.750
Okay.

1012
01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:55.041
Come on.

1013
01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:04.875
- Sorry about the smell. - What
smell?

1014
01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.583
Here.

1015
01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:15.125
Where did you get that?

1016
01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:18.374
I... found it.

1017
01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.750
- Whoa. - You haven't seen
anything yet.

1018
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.207
Here.

1019
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.750
- What's that? - My tripod.

1020
01:13:28.583 --> 01:13:31.166
Doesn't it have to be nighttime?

1021
01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:35.708
Look.

1022
01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:40.416
- Where? - There.

1023
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.250
Where the ocean meets the sky.

1024
01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:44.915
What - what's that?

1025
01:13:44.916 --> 01:13:49.124
SpaceX. It's the launch site in
Boca Chica, Texas.

1026
01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:53.416
Soon the world's biggest rockets
will be launched from there.

1027
01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:57.291
And we can watch them from right
here.

1028
01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.708
They're asleep.

1029
01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.041
What are you reading?

1030
01:14:30.416 --> 01:14:32.832
About moral dilemmas.

1031
01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:36.583
I don't understand a lot of it,
but it's very interesting.

1032
01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.582
Like...

1033
01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:42.040
let's say you're the captain of
a sinking ship.

1034
01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:46.957
You have 30 passengers, but the
lifeboat only holds 15.

1035
01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.208
How do you choose who to save,
and why?

1036
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:54.957
- What class is that for? - It's
not for school.

1037
01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:58.040
I got it from the university.
For myself.

1038
01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.957
Wait, what?

1039
01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:04.165
That library is amazing, you
should see it.

1040
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.124
I thought I'd like to study
philosophy,

1041
01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:11.208
but after seeing all those
books... I dunno.

1042
01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:15.750
But I want to be a professor,
that's for sure.

1043
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.583
Philosophy?

1044
01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.583
Professor?

1045
01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.208
Honey...

1046
01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:29.083
You're not even going back to
school next year.

1047
01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:33.332
I have to work, who's going to
look after your baby brother,

1048
01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.708
huh?

1049
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:43.166
Look, if it means a lot to you
and you really want to,

1050
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.040
I'm sure you can get back to it
after, once he's in

1051
01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.583
kindergarten.

1052
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.041
Let's go, Paloma.

1053
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:47.207
Oh, there you are! Special
presentation today.

1054
01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:51.665
Your class gets the first slot.
9:00 am. Computer lab.

1055
01:16:51.666 --> 01:16:53.083
Okay.

1056
01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:55.915
The District sent a technician.

1057
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.957
He'll show some basic concept to
the kids

1058
01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:00.499
He'll explain to them how a
computer works.

1059
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.332
Really? Yes, he's setting up
now.

1060
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:03.416
- Really? - Yes, he's setting up
now.

1061
01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:06.083
What happened?

1062
01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.875
I insisted, I pressed.

1063
01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:13.249
I could kiss you.

1064
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.290
Please don't...

1065
01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.416
I haven't brushed my teeth.

1066
01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:20.250
See you there.

1067
01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:22.750
Nico!

1068
01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:27.125
- How did it go? - I think...
good?

1069
01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:41.707
- What's this? - A little gift.

1070
01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:44.166
Call it a Christmas bonus...

1071
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:49.708
I'm not big on tests, much less
practice ones.

1072
01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.708
You see the date?

1073
01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:58.582
2012? But that's this year.

1074
01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:02.583
It's not a practice test. It's
the real deal.

1075
01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:06.207
- Where did you get this? - It's
everywhere.

1076
01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:09.041
You just have to know where to
look.

1077
01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:11.416
Thanks but...

1078
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:12.583
No.

1079
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.915
It's ok. We're all together on
this.

1080
01:18:16.916 --> 01:18:21.124
You can keep doing your thing if
you prepare them with this

1081
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:23.540
the other teachers won't be so
bothered by your little...

1082
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:25.749
experiments.

1083
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:30.083
Thanks, but... Count me out.

1084
01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:34.249
Thing is, we're evaluated as a
whole.

1085
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:39.416
If your students do poorly, you
bring us all down.

1086
01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:42.540
So you kind of... have to be in.

1087
01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:43.540
What about the kids?

1088
01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:44.665
They'll have no idea.

1089
01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:48.165
If they excel, they graduate. If
they fail, they graduate.

1090
01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:50.540
No matter what happens, they
graduate. That's how it's always

1091
01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:51.999
been.

1092
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.290
The only difference is whether
we get a bonus along the way or

1093
01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:56.124
not.

1094
01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:58.165
No, the only difference

1095
01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:01.291
is whether or not we teach them
to cheat.

1096
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.583
That's the difference.

1097
01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:27.041
Laptops? Even better!

1098
01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:31.499
- Good morning. - Morning!

1099
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.416
Believing computers are a vital
part of the modern economy...

1100
01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.249
Eh, the government of
Matamoros - - Cut to the chase,

1101
01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:44.583
man.

1102
01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.083
Okay.

1103
01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:54.041
This is a CPU, or Central
Processing Unit.

1104
01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.707
It's the brain of the
computer...

1105
01:19:56.708 --> 01:20:01.207
The CPU stores the data and
executes

1106
01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:04.790
the operations that make a
computer work...

1107
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:09.249
Did you know that a computer can
execute up to...

1108
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:14.416
four million commands per
second...

1109
01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.291
Hey!

1110
01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:25.749
- What are you doing? - Excuse
me?

1111
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:29.250
I assume you gave this to my
daughter?

1112
01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:32.250
You must be Paloma's father.

1113
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:35.165
Twelve hundred dollars.

1114
01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:38.249
- I don't make that in a year. -
No, no, uh...

1115
01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:42.500
They offer scholarships, the
school would recommend her.

1116
01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:45.165
Paloma has a good shot.

1117
01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:48.624
We could hold a fundraiser for
her travel expenses.

1118
01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.624
I'm sure that - - Look,
Maestro.

1119
01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:52.125
I may be poor.

1120
01:20:52.126 --> 01:20:55.749
I've worked all my life sifting
through trash,

1121
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.957
but I'm no beggar.

1122
01:20:56.958 --> 01:21:00.583
Oh, no, no. That's not what I
meant.

1123
01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:02.665
Look.

1124
01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:06.125
I know this may seem like a big
stretch for you,

1125
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.999
but Paloma isn't just any
student.

1126
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.707
- She can get that scholarship.
- And then, what?

1127
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:15.040
When she goes to this "space
camp" and sees all that crazy

1128
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.082
stuff,

1129
01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:20.083
And then returns here? To
reality?

1130
01:21:20.916 --> 01:21:21.790
You know...

1131
01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:25.207
You blast these kids off like
rocket ships into space,

1132
01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.749
after packing their heads with
all these ideas.

1133
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.749
But when they leave your class
and return to the real world,

1134
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.374
when they come crashing back
down to earth, where will you be

1135
01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.124
then?

1136
01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:39.208
Will you be here to catch them
and tell them to keep trying?

1137
01:21:39.375 --> 01:21:40.207
No...

1138
01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:44.874
You'll be filling another bunch
of heads with your crazy ideas,

1139
01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:47.582
reminding them of what they
can't have,

1140
01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:49.540
what they can never be.

1141
01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:51.083
Papa?

1142
01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:53.875
Please, Maestro.

1143
01:21:54.416 --> 01:21:57.041
Don't do that to my daughter.

1144
01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:59.250
Come on, Paloma.

1145
01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.957
- You can't go in! - Excuse me.

1146
01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.124
- I know you're busy. - I tried
to stop him.

1147
01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:41.874
Sorry to interrupt, but - -
Who are you?

1148
01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.707
I'm Sergio Juárez Correa.

1149
01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:46.665
I teach at Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López.

1150
01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:49.083
I wanted to talk to you about...

1151
01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:52.082
About the situation with...

1152
01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.041
with our computers.

1153
01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.207
It's fine, Martha.

1154
01:22:56.208 --> 01:23:01.916
We always make time for our
soldiers on the front line.

1155
01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:06.290
- Interesting choice of words. -
Pardon me?

1156
01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:09.374
Soldier. Front lines...

1157
01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:12.707
As if I were at war, fighting an
enemy.

1158
01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:14.458
But no. I...

1159
01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:16.707
I spend all day with...

1160
01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:18.166
Children.

1161
01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.708
So, tell me...

1162
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.583
How can I help you?

1163
01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.082
Nacho asked about you today.

1164
01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:58.749
"When is the pretty boy going to
start?"

1165
01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:02.416
Now that school's winding down,
he wants to show you the ropes.

1166
01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.083
What is it?

1167
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.040
Do you see out there?

1168
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.999
You can't tell where the ocean
ends

1169
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.708
and the sky begins.

1170
01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:17.374
Did you know that right now,
technically,

1171
01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:20.250
we're standing in outer space?

1172
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.207
What?

1173
01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:25.915
Yeah, it comes all the way down
to here.

1174
01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:30.165
What we think of as the sky is
just a layer of gas.

1175
01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:34.583
It doesn't feel like there's
anything, it seems empty,

1176
01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:37.332
but it actually has mass -

1177
01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:38.999
like weight -

1178
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.416
and it's always being pulled
towards Earth.

1179
01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:44.875
It's trapped here.

1180
01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:47.250
Just like we are.

1181
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.207
- Hey, I'm not going to work for
Nacho. - Are you serious?

1182
01:24:56.208 --> 01:24:59.040
But you hate school. What
happened?

1183
01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:02.957
I don't know. I just... like it.

1184
01:25:02.958 --> 01:25:05.832
There's this teacher,

1185
01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:08.082
who does things differently.

1186
01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:11.916
With him, I think I could
actually be smart.

1187
01:25:13.791 --> 01:25:15.665
And, there's this girl...

1188
01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:19.082
Ha! The truth comes out.

1189
01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:21.708
Check out our little Don Juan!

1190
01:25:22.458 --> 01:25:23.624
Listen...

1191
01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.040
If you had a shot to do
something else, I'd want you to

1192
01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:27.540
take it.

1193
01:25:27.541 --> 01:25:30.665
But with Nacho, once you're in,
you're never out.

1194
01:25:30.666 --> 01:25:33.875
But I was never really in...

1195
01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:35.708
Right?

1196
01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:47.291
Hey! Need a ride?

1197
01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:52.041
I was enjoying the walk, but
sure.

1198
01:26:02.708 --> 01:26:06.708
Your car in the shop? Yeah.

1199
01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.541
Forever.

1200
01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:12.082
I traded it for something more
useful.

1201
01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:14.583
Is that what I think it is?

1202
01:26:15.916 --> 01:26:18.207
Now you'll see what they can do.

1203
01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:22.999
- You didn't have to do that. -
Oh, I did.

1204
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.790
- I'm sorry, I really thought -
- It's okay, I know.

1205
01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:30.750
In fact, I really appreciate
your effort.

1206
01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:34.416
Your wife didn't get mad?

1207
01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:39.750
- Are you married? - No.

1208
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.040
Good, because...

1209
01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:44.416
I think I'll be staying at your
place for a while.

1210
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.750
His approach is unorthodox, but
the results are compelling.

1211
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.583
Yes, I'm sure.

1212
01:27:08.166 --> 01:27:11.374
We have visitors. To what do we
owe the honor?

1213
01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:13.749
I take it you know each other -

1214
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.165
What are you doing?

1215
01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:16.749
Meditating.

1216
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:20.540
We were having a discussion and
things got pretty intense,

1217
01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:24.750
so we were taking a moment to
cool down.

1218
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.165
Don't mind me. Please, continue.

1219
01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:29.040
I'm just here to observe.

1220
01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:31.083
What were you discussing?

1221
01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:35.083
We were discussing... morality.

1222
01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.040
Morality?

1223
01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:40.290
That's not a subject we're
familiar with.

1224
01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:44.874
According to the lesson plan...
March 20th...

1225
01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:48.832
you should be preparing for the
ENLACE test.

1226
01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:52.749
Yeah, but Lupita has taken an
interest in philosophy.

1227
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.374
Philosophy? And she was sharing
with the class

1228
01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.208
some of the things she has
learned.

1229
01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:01.040
Last year, in the fifth grade,

1230
01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:06.040
this class's scores were among
the worst in the nation.

1231
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:08.665
I find it strange you have time
to do anything but prepare for

1232
01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:11.082
the test.

1233
01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:13.040
Well, like I said.

1234
01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:15.874
Someone told Lupita she was far
too young

1235
01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:17.415
to read about philosophy.

1236
01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:19.874
So, we were trying to see if it
could answer some difficult

1237
01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:22.083
questions.

1238
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:25.250
Like which?

1239
01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:29.249
I wanted to know what John
Stuart Mill would say about

1240
01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.665
abortion.

1241
01:28:31.666 --> 01:28:32.540
Abortion?

1242
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:37.125
And what do you think he'd
say? - Well...

1243
01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:44.040
If we want the greatest good for
the greatest number of people,

1244
01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.790
I think that if you're
struggling to afford rent and

1245
01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:48.957
food,

1246
01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:51.874
It's better not to bring more
children into the world who are

1247
01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:53.999
only going to suffer.

1248
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.915
And that would also cause more
suffering for others.

1249
01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:58.999
So, yes.

1250
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.083
There are cases where abortion
might be the right thing to do.

1251
01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.999
My god.

1252
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.416
So, how do you feel about this
conclusion?

1253
01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:15.125
Well, I think about my own
siblings.

1254
01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:19.124
Sometimes they are a lot of
work,

1255
01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:24.583
but I also don't like imagining
them not having been born.

1256
01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:27.750
I don't know.

1257
01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:31.250
It's very complicated.

1258
01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.124
But it's cool.

1259
01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:35.832
We all agreed that condoms are
the obvious answer.

1260
01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:38.874
- Condoms?! - Well, not everyone
agrees.

1261
01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:42.583
In fact, we had quite a debate
about that, didn't we?

1262
01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:46.999
According to Stuart Mill,
something can be good or bad

1263
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.415
depending on the situation.

1264
01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.040
Is there something that in his
view

1265
01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:55.208
would always be immoral in every
case?

1266
01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:59.583
Anything that hurts many for the
benefit of a few.

1267
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:00.333
Like what?

1268
01:30:00.334 --> 01:30:05.124
Like if someone steals something
that is meant for everybody?

1269
01:30:05.125 --> 01:30:09.750
Very good, Nico. So something
like...

1270
01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:12.875
Corruption?

1271
01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:19.040
Given you have the time to
discuss such advanced subjects

1272
01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:19.333
in class,

1273
01:30:19.334 --> 01:30:24.875
You must have total command of
the basic sixth grade skills

1274
01:30:25.166 --> 01:30:27.207
You, tell me...

1275
01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:30.999
What's the square root of 256?

1276
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.041
What's the square root of 256?
What is that supposed to show?

1277
01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:33.165
What is that supposed to show?

1278
01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:38.583
No? With whom was Mexico at war
in 1846?

1279
01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:43.208
He hasn't gone over that yet,
he's -

1280
01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:47.125
Explain Darwin's Theory of
Evolution.

1281
01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:49.125
Hold on -

1282
01:30:54.125 --> 01:30:55.832
As I suspected...

1283
01:30:55.833 --> 01:30:58.749
This child lacks the basic
knowledge expected from a sixth

1284
01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.082
grader.

1285
01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:04.457
Mr. Juárez, he's the
definition...

1286
01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.040
...of an ignoramus.

1287
01:31:06.041 --> 01:31:08.999
Now wait - Hey Nico!

1288
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.790
And undisciplined too!

1289
01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:14.332
What's wrong with you? Why did
you do that?

1290
01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:15.999
To me, say what you want, but
don't you talk to the kids that

1291
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.041
way.

1292
01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:22.125
The square root of 256 is 16.

1293
01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:26.125
Mexico fought the U.S. in 1846.

1294
01:31:26.583 --> 01:31:31.291
Darwin's theory of Evolution is
the survival of the fittest.

1295
01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:40.083
Thank you, Mr. Juárez. See me in
the Director's Office.

1296
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.332
I've been thinking about our
game from the first day,

1297
01:32:02.333 --> 01:32:04.750
remember?

1298
01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:07.540
The boats and the passengers?

1299
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:10.208
There's an obvious solution.

1300
01:32:10.541 --> 01:32:13.957
You shouldn't sell more tickets
than there are spaces in the

1301
01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:16.125
lifeboats.

1302
01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:31.207
- Wait, Sergio. - I bet he's
taking bribes from those

1303
01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:32.124
assholes!

1304
01:32:32.125 --> 01:32:34.125
Wait, Sergio!

1305
01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:37.874
I asked you not to kick the
hornet's nest, and what did you

1306
01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:38.333
do!?

1307
01:32:38.334 --> 01:32:41.207
Abortion? Condoms? Corruption?!

1308
01:32:41.208 --> 01:32:44.582
I can't ask my students to be
fearless learners, to do

1309
01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:45.166
whatever it takes -

1310
01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:48.374
to go wherever their inquiries
take them -

1311
01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:49.707
And then what?

1312
01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:52.165
Turn into a bootlicker right in
front of them?

1313
01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.957
Think of the big picture

1314
01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:56.999
What matters is that they keep
you as their teacher.

1315
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.041
So what if you have to lick a
few boots?

1316
01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:01.541
Are you serious?

1317
01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:08.457
Mr. Director? I'm waiting...

1318
01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:10.583
Right away, sir.

1319
01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:19.040
Mr. Juárez...

1320
01:33:19.041 --> 01:33:24.207
I must say I was very disturbed
to receive numerous complaints

1321
01:33:24.208 --> 01:33:27.124
that your kids aren't being
prepared for the ENLACE test,

1322
01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:31.332
But I didn't imagine the
situation would be this bad.

1323
01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:34.874
So you are hereby suspended for
two weeks.

1324
01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:35.083
What?!

1325
01:33:35.084 --> 01:33:37.249
Until after your class has been
prepared for the ENLACE test,

1326
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:40.249
For which you have obviously so
little regard -

1327
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:41.541
Look...

1328
01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.332
You're right, I won't deny it.

1329
01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:47.165
I think it's a useless test.

1330
01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:49.415
but don't take that out on the
kids.

1331
01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:52.207
OK I'll do it, I'll prepare
them.

1332
01:33:52.208 --> 01:33:55.082
For the next two weeks, that's
all we'll do: prepare for the

1333
01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:57.207
ENLACE.

1334
01:33:57.208 --> 01:34:01.250
But please... don't suspend me.

1335
01:34:01.416 --> 01:34:03.665
To bring in anyone else but me
to prepare them would just be...

1336
01:34:03.666 --> 01:34:06.208
stupidity.

1337
01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:10.207
You can thank your Director that
this is only a suspension,

1338
01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:12.040
and not a permanent dismissal.

1339
01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:15.165
But to be honest, I'm starting
to reconsider my decision.

1340
01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:18.083
That won't be necessary.

1341
01:34:18.708 --> 01:34:20.499
That won't be necessary.

1342
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.708
Anything else to add?

1343
01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:24.708
No.

1344
01:34:25.875 --> 01:34:28.083
Good day, Professors.

1345
01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:40.082
This is insane, Chucho.

1346
01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:44.040
Did you know that in my class,
right here in this school,

1347
01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:47.290
there's a girl who I'm sure is a
certifiable genius?

1348
01:34:47.291 --> 01:34:49.957
The only thing you knew about
her before I got here was that

1349
01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:52.583
"she could apply herself more."

1350
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:54.290
Really?

1351
01:34:54.291 --> 01:34:58.165
How many kids in this country
could be like her?

1352
01:34:58.166 --> 01:35:01.082
But as long as we tolerate this
deliberate ignorance, we will

1353
01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:03.540
never know.

1354
01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:05.165
I'm sorry, Sergio.

1355
01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.249
My hands are tied. Yeah, yeah.

1356
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.457
Consider it a vacation.

1357
01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:12.708
Go spend some time with your
wife and baby.

1358
01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.291
Hey, you okay?

1359
01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:50.165
You know? You're not stupid.

1360
01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:54.583
Or an ignoramus, or whatever
that man called you.

1361
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.415
I mean it.

1362
01:35:56.416 --> 01:35:59.040
You always come up with the most
clever things to say, so

1363
01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:00.999
quickly...

1364
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.583
I could never do that.

1365
01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:32.416
There's the pretty boy!

1366
01:36:33.666 --> 01:36:37.999
Chepe says you're confused about
who you work for?

1367
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.875
I couldn't believe it, so I
wanted to see for myself...

1368
01:36:42.625 --> 01:36:45.875
So? Do you work for me, or not?

1369
01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:54.707
It suddenly occurs to me that
the reason you're confused

1370
01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:59.082
is because we never gave you a
proper welcome to the family.

1371
01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:02.083
A real initiation, you know?

1372
01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:08.124
Who's this?

1373
01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:10.250
She's no one, just a friend.

1374
01:37:10.333 --> 01:37:12.083
Go home.

1375
01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:15.082
- Hang on, love. - Hey!

1376
01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:16.874
- What's going on? - Are you a
virgin?

1377
01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:17.957
- What?! - Nacho, don't!

1378
01:37:17.958 --> 01:37:20.832
- She'll do. - She's just a kid,
man!

1379
01:37:20.833 --> 01:37:21.041
Hey!

1380
01:37:21.042 --> 01:37:23.915
Look at your brother, trying to
act tough!

1381
01:37:23.916 --> 01:37:26.957
They're just kids, man!

1382
01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:29.208
- Wait, Nico! - What the fuck?!

1383
01:37:58.333 --> 01:38:00.708
Lupe... Lupe!

1384
01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:02.875
Are you okay?!

1385
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.708
Are you all okay?

1386
01:38:18.958 --> 01:38:20.416
Are you ok?

1387
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:23.125
Paloma, are you all right?!

1388
01:38:26.375 --> 01:38:28.082
Nico...

1389
01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:29.583
Nico...

1390
01:39:33.458 --> 01:39:37.540
Carlos ate 3/8 of the pizza,

1391
01:39:37.541 --> 01:39:42.540
whereas Ricardo ate 1/4 of the
same pizza.

1392
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:48.750
How much of the pizza did Carlos
and Ricardo eat?

1393
01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:51.916
Anyone?

1394
01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:09.624
Good morning, Laura.

1395
01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:11.082
What a surprise.

1396
01:40:11.083 --> 01:40:14.208
Maybe you can get him out of
bed.

1397
01:40:16.166 --> 01:40:17.583
Excuse me.

1398
01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:35.291
Can we talk for a minute?

1399
01:40:39.958 --> 01:40:42.665
Sergio, the ENLACE test is
tomorrow.

1400
01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:46.250
That means your suspension is
over.

1401
01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.250
We're understaffed, we could use
your help.

1402
01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:55.750
We haven't heard anything from
you.

1403
01:40:57.375 --> 01:41:00.583
I need to know if you're coming
back.

1404
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:09.999
You know I couldn't do anything
about what happened.

1405
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.583
You know I was against it.

1406
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.541
Sergio, open up!

1407
01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:29.082
I'm not leaving. I'm staying
right here.

1408
01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:33.041
I'm going to eat your food, crap
in your toilet...

1409
01:41:33.208 --> 01:41:37.416
Whatever it takes, I'm not
leaving until you come out.

1410
01:41:42.416 --> 01:41:44.291
Sergio...

1411
01:41:44.416 --> 01:41:47.583
You can't walk out on these
children.

1412
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.125
They're traumatized enough as it
is.

1413
01:41:53.041 --> 01:41:57.208
Maybe it's the best way to
prepare them for the future.

1414
01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:00.083
- Hi, how are you? - Go.

1415
01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:02.958
Seriously?

1416
01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:06.290
That's it? You're gonna give up
so easily?

1417
01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:08.040
Yeah, why not?

1418
01:42:08.041 --> 01:42:11.583
You don't want to finish what
you started?

1419
01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:16.790
Sergio...

1420
01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:20.208
You saw for yourself that you
were succeeding.

1421
01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:24.041
Want to know what I succeeded
at?

1422
01:42:24.583 --> 01:42:29.165
I succeeded at getting... they
killed... one of my...

1423
01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:30.165
Look, look...

1424
01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:32.290
If you don't want to, you don't
have to come back...

1425
01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:35.165
Great, so why are you here?

1426
01:42:35.166 --> 01:42:35.208
Great, so why are you here?
For the kids...

1427
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:36.707
For the kids...

1428
01:42:36.708 --> 01:42:39.249
I want to get my kids back.

1429
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:41.916
They stopped coming?

1430
01:42:42.083 --> 01:42:44.082
I want them to take the ENLACE
test.

1431
01:42:44.083 --> 01:42:47.250
That fucking test...

1432
01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.416
Chucho...

1433
01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:52.083
Look, like I told you...

1434
01:42:55.083 --> 01:42:57.207
I failed...

1435
01:42:57.208 --> 01:42:58.416
Them -

1436
01:42:59.041 --> 01:43:00.124
Nico.

1437
01:43:00.125 --> 01:43:01.665
I thought...

1438
01:43:01.666 --> 01:43:04.875
I thought I was doing things the
right way.

1439
01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:07.125
Really, but -

1440
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:09.915
I should've checked the
backpack...

1441
01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:11.999
No, if I come back they're just
going to end up paying the

1442
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.125
price.

1443
01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:17.583
Again.

1444
01:43:20.125 --> 01:43:23.999
- Sorry... - Wait a minute,
Sergio.

1445
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.019
Sorry...

1446
01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:24.125
Wait a minute, Sergio. I really do think
you were on the verge of something big with

1447
01:43:24.126 --> 01:43:25.957
I really do think you were on
the verge of something big with

1448
01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:28.083
them.

1449
01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:32.166
I saw it myself.

1450
01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:36.832
I have never seen children
respond like that before. Ever!

1451
01:43:36.833 --> 01:43:40.499
Or make such progress in so
little time.

1452
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.332
But no one gives a shit what we
think of this method.

1453
01:43:43.333 --> 01:43:46.165
No one will care unless we show
measurable results.

1454
01:43:46.166 --> 01:43:48.665
That's what the test is for.

1455
01:43:48.666 --> 01:43:53.041
You said it yourself. Paloma
might be a genius.

1456
01:43:53.166 --> 01:43:55.583
But, how would we know -

1457
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:59.916
Paloma stopped coming?

1458
01:44:49.125 --> 01:44:51.083
Good afternoon.

1459
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.041
Paloma?

1460
01:45:50.166 --> 01:45:52.624
What are you doing here?

1461
01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:56.208
The director said he'd leave me
alone if

1462
01:45:57.333 --> 01:46:00.291
...I convince you to come back
to school.

1463
01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:02.916
You're not going back?

1464
01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:07.749
I don't know if I can.

1465
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:09.458
Why not?

1466
01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:13.708
Maybe your dad was right...

1467
01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:18.708
Maybe I've done more harm than
good.

1468
01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:22.250
I can't come back.

1469
01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:26.875
I have to look after him now.
He's sick.

1470
01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:37.416
I'm so sorry, Paloma.

1471
01:46:41.083 --> 01:46:43.208
I'm so sorry.

1472
01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:46.916
But my dad wasn't right...

1473
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.541
You told us we had as much
potential as any other kid.

1474
01:46:53.541 --> 01:46:58.415
But what we didn't have before
you, was the belief...

1475
01:46:58.416 --> 01:47:01.165
That we could fulfill it.

1476
01:47:01.166 --> 01:47:02.999
I never could have allowed
myself to imagine the things I

1477
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.583
did in your class.

1478
01:47:05.833 --> 01:47:10.041
About who I could be, what I
could do.

1479
01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:13.999
And that's something I get to
have now.

1480
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.250
I wouldn't have that if it
weren't for you.

1481
01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:20.291
And I'll never...

1482
01:47:21.791 --> 01:47:23.750
ever forget that.

1483
01:47:26.541 --> 01:47:29.916
But sometimes, believing is not
enough.

1484
01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:33.208
Sometimes...

1485
01:47:33.958 --> 01:47:36.250
the reality is the reality.

1486
01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:38.541
Look around...

1487
01:47:39.875 --> 01:47:42.708
This is my reality.

1488
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.583
There's no escaping it.

1489
01:47:46.416 --> 01:47:48.416
And people like me...

1490
01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:52.125
like Nico...

1491
01:47:57.083 --> 01:47:59.125
We don't get to escape.

1492
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.083
I understand.

1493
01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:33.750
Mr. Juárez.

1494
01:48:34.458 --> 01:48:36.250
Mr. Noyola.

1495
01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:40.125
Paloma doesn't need this
anymore.

1496
01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:44.957
You should take it back. It
might get damaged here.

1497
01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:48.208
But... what is it?

1498
01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:54.750
She borrowed it from school, for
a science project.

1499
01:48:57.166 --> 01:49:01.041
The school could never afford
something like this.

1500
01:49:08.916 --> 01:49:11.083
She didn't borrow this.

1501
01:49:12.208 --> 01:49:13.374
She made it.

1502
01:49:13.375 --> 01:49:15.208
What...?

1503
01:49:15.583 --> 01:49:17.457
That's impossible.

1504
01:49:17.458 --> 01:49:20.875
Isn't everything impossible
until it is done?

1505
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:24.707
Wow.

1506
01:49:24.708 --> 01:49:27.916
Paloma is an extraordinary girl,
Mr. Noyola.

1507
01:49:29.166 --> 01:49:32.583
I only wonder if you know just
how extraordinary.

1508
01:49:33.375 --> 01:49:36.082
Don't say that, Maestro.

1509
01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:37.750
This is hers.

1510
01:49:38.583 --> 01:49:39.875
It's hers.

1511
01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:53.041
Can we make one more stop?

1512
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.250
Paloma?

1513
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.208
You should be resting, Papa.

1514
01:51:17.083 --> 01:51:19.875
Come, sit with me.

1515
01:51:22.041 --> 01:51:24.208
Are you feeling all right?

1516
01:51:56.166 --> 01:51:58.416
It's all gonna be ok.

1517
01:54:08.166 --> 01:54:12.875
That list of yours... have phone
numbers?

1518
01:55:09.166 --> 01:55:10.583
Profe?

1519
01:55:13.125 --> 01:55:14.875
Look at that!

1520
01:55:21.583 --> 01:55:23.083
Over there.

1521
01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:26.250
Sit wherever you like.

1522
01:55:44.833 --> 01:55:47.208
Hurry up, everyone.

1523
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.458
C'mon, guys, we're running
late! - I'm coming!

1524
01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:08.250
How are we doing?

1525
01:56:08.375 --> 01:56:10.708
Just a few more.

1526
01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:13.875
Look.

1527
01:56:14.166 --> 01:56:15.999
- What's up with him? - Due to
numerous reports of

1528
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.165
irregularities,

1529
01:56:18.166 --> 01:56:20.624
they decided to change this
year's test.

1530
01:56:20.625 --> 01:56:26.416
Perhaps they got a lot of tips
from concerned citizens.

1531
01:56:28.083 --> 01:56:32.083
At least we're all on a level
playing field.

1532
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.541
What?

1533
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.457
Everyone take your seats...

1534
01:56:41.458 --> 01:56:44.999
Do not touch the materials in
front of you until the test

1535
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.416
begins.

1536
01:58:02.541 --> 01:58:06.083
Ok everyone, let's quiet down
please.

1537
01:58:06.625 --> 01:58:09.166
We're about to begin.

1538
01:58:11.916 --> 01:58:14.208
All right guys, listen; real
quick.

1539
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.790
This test measures how much you
know, okay?

1540
01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:21.374
Maybe... this year I didn't
teach you everything you need to

1541
01:58:21.375 --> 01:58:23.750
know.

1542
01:58:24.375 --> 01:58:26.165
But you did learn how to think.

1543
01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:29.207
So, there might be some things
that you don't recognize...

1544
01:58:29.208 --> 01:58:33.208
but there's nothing in this test
you can't figure out.

1545
01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:35.040
Okay?

1546
01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:35.083
Okay?
Got it?

1547
01:58:35.084 --> 01:58:36.583
Got it?

1548
01:58:41.583 --> 01:58:43.166
Actually...

1549
01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:52.040
Actually there is one thing I
want you to know before you take

1550
01:58:52.041 --> 01:58:54.416
this test:

1551
01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:08.041
You have all taught me so...
very much.

1552
01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:16.208
And I am so very proud of each
and every single one of you.

1553
01:59:22.083 --> 01:59:25.416
All right! Now let's go kick
some ass!

1554
01:59:37.083 --> 01:59:41.250
You will have three hours to
complete the test.

1555
01:59:43.416 --> 01:59:48.583
You should try to answer as many
questions as you can.

1556
01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:57.125
Any answers left blank will
count against you

1557
02:00:00.541 --> 02:00:02.125
Good luck!

1558
02:00:19.125 --> 02:00:20.708
And...

1559
02:00:20.916 --> 02:00:23.041
...let's begin.

1560
02:00:24.375 --> 02:00:26.790
The year before Sergio's
arrival, only 55% of his

1561
02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:30.207
students passed the ENLACE in
Math and 69% in Language.

1562
02:00:30.208 --> 02:00:33.207
None received a score of
"Excellent."

1563
02:00:33.208 --> 02:00:34.999
In 2012, after a year with
Sergio,

1564
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.374
93% passed the Mathematics
portion, with 63% scoring

1565
02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:37.999
"Excellent",

1566
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.332
and 97.5% passed the Language
portion, with 72% scoring

1567
02:00:39.333 --> 02:00:41.165
"Excellent".

1568
02:00:41.166 --> 02:00:44.374
Ten of Sergio's students scored
in the top 0.1% nationally in

1569
02:00:44.375 --> 02:00:46.875
Mathematics.

1570
02:00:47.833 --> 02:00:50.624
Paloma Noyola achieved the
highest score...

1571
02:00:50.625 --> 02:00:53.082
...in all of Mexico.

1572
02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:55.874
She became a national sensation
and received a private grant

1573
02:00:55.875 --> 02:00:59.041
that allowed her to move to a
new home.

1574
02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:02.665
Sergio Juárez Correa still lives
in Matamoros

1575
02:01:02.666 --> 02:01:06.207
where he continues to teach
sixth grade.

1576
02:01:06.208 --> 02:01:09.124
José Urbina López Elementary
School still has no computer

1577
02:01:09.125 --> 02:01:11.416
lab.

1578
02:01:48.458 --> 02:01:54.208
Like a flame flickering in the
wind

1579
02:01:56.083 --> 02:02:01.583
It's the sand that rises

1580
02:02:03.458 --> 02:02:08.540
The sorrow that time heals

1581
02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:15.624
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1582
02:02:15.625 --> 02:02:23.208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1583
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:34.041
Like the angel of destiny

1584
02:02:36.208 --> 02:02:41.125
Casts stones along the way

1585
02:02:43.125 --> 02:02:48.374
It's my voice, my light, my
heartbeat

1586
02:02:48.375 --> 02:02:56.082
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1587
02:02:56.083 --> 02:03:03.208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1588
02:03:05.583 --> 02:03:11.208
The laughter that sweetens life

1589
02:03:11.791 --> 02:03:17.291
The fight I embrace each new day

1590
02:03:19.083 --> 02:03:24.790
All those pearls are hidden

1591
02:03:24.791 --> 02:03:32.458
In the darkness they'll remain.

1592
02:03:39.208 --> 02:03:43.082
Let's push against the current

1593
02:03:43.083 --> 02:03:46.499
Through seas and rivers, a tidal
surge

1594
02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:50.374
A strong burst of faith is
what's needed

1595
02:03:50.375 --> 02:03:54.041
Where will it lead?

1596
02:04:04.625 --> 02:04:08.583
Where will they go?

1597
02:04:14.541 --> 02:04:19.166
The light looks at us serene

1598
02:04:21.875 --> 02:04:26.083
Restless upon waking

1599
02:04:29.083 --> 02:04:34.124
A song that lives and resonates

1600
02:04:34.125 --> 02:04:41.165
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1601
02:04:41.166 --> 02:04:48.750
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1602
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.082
It's knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1603
02:04:56.083 --> 02:05:03.625
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1604
02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:10.832
Knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

1605
02:05:10.833 --> 02:05:23.041
The sun will rise, come morning
light

1606
02:05:26.166 --> 02:05:27.915
“The only thing that interferes
with my learning is my

1607
02:05:27.916 --> 02:05:30.040
education”

1608
02:05:30.041 --> 02:05:33.083
Albert Einstein
