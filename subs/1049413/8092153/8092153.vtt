<i>What you are now witnessing</i>

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.723
<i>is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,</i>

4
00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:58.559
<i>a lost world in South America.</i>

5
00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.852
<i>Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,</i>

6
00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:03.897
<i>it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.</i>

7
00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.234
<i>Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?</i>

8
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.238
<i>Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!</i>

9
00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.408
<i>The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible, the</i> Spirit of Adventure,

10
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.909
<i>in New Hampshire this week,</i>

11
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:19.037
<i>completing a yearlong expedition
to the lost world.</i>

12
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.040
<i>This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself</i>

13
00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.086
<i>and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.</i>

14
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.922
<i>And here comes the adventurer now.</i>

15
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.174
<i>Never apart from his faithful dogs,</i>

16
00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.552
<i>Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.</i>

17
00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.679
<i>It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,</i>

18
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.224
<i>complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.</i>

19
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:43.520
<i>And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.</i>

20
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:44.938
<i>And how!</i>

21
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.399
<i>Adventure is out there!</i>

22
00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:52.112
<i>But what
has Muntz brought back this time?</i>

23
00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:56.950
<i>Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!</i>

24
00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.955
<i>And, golly, what a swell monster this is!</i>

25
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.708
<i>But what's this? Scientists cry foul.</i>

26
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.960
<i>The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz</i>

27
00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.795
<i>of fabricating the skeleton.</i>

28
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.047
No!

29
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.882
<i>The organization strips Muntz</i>

30
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.133
<i>of his membership.</i>

31
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.805
<i>Humiliated,
Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls</i>

32
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.808
<i>and promises
to capture the beast alive!</i>

33
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:24.603
<i>I promise to capture the beast alive,</i>

34
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.398
<i>and I will not come back until I do!</i>

35
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.444
<i>And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.</i>

36
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.237
<i>Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,</i>

37
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.742
<i>and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!</i>

38
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.000
<i>Here's Charles Muntz</i>

39
00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.336
<i>piloting his famous dirigible.</i>

40
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.467
<i>He hurdles Pikes Peak.</i>

41
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.595
<i>He hurdles the Grand Canyon.</i>

42
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.598
<i>He hurdles Mount Everest.</i>

43
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.270
<i>He goes around Mount Everest.</i>

44
00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:10.190
<i>Is there nothing he cannot do?</i>

45
00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.611
<i>Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is..."</i>

46
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:18.156
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.159
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.122
Must get <i>Spirit of Adventure</i>
over Mount Rushmore!

49
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.292
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:36.800
All engines, ahead full !
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.678
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:43.557
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.145
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:52.482
Oh ! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:59.281
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah ! No time!
A storm ! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.824
- What are you doing?
- Ahhh!

57
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.827
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.871
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.875
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.878
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:14.463 --> 00:04:16.715
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.719
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.223
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.105
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.946
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.908
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:47.579
There it is.

68
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.668
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.091
Go on.

70
00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:21.571
Ow.

71
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:22.989
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.326
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.245
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.958
I am about to let you
see something

75
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.794
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.255
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:39.256 --> 00:05:42.551
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.929
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.851
My Adventure Book.

80
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.145
You know him.

81
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.899
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:01.027
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:06.700
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.369
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:14.332
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

86
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.712
I ripped this right out of a library book.

87
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:23.466
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.177
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.388
And once I get there?

90
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.434
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:38.398
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

92
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.199
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.244
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

94
00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:56.374
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.920
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.007
Adventure is out there!

97
00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:07.844
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.055
I like you!

99
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:13.892
Wow.

100
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.222
Hah!

101
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.862
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.074
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

103
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.913
Uh ! Mail's here.

104
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:08.222
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh, brother.

105
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.434
Hmm...

106
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.651
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

107
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.612
No. Yes!

108
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:26.908
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

109
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:28.451
Well, just to let you know,

110
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.120
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

111
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.623
and for double his last offer!

112
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:34.916
What do you say to that?

113
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:39.504
Uh, I take that as a "no," then?

114
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.965
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

115
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.635
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

116
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.846
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

117
00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:56.521
<i>You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!</i>

118
00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.023
<i>I am not with him!</i>

119
00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:02.693
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

120
00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.780
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

121
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.324
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

122
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.161
I'll take that as a maybe.

123
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.497
<i>Order now,
you get the camera,</i>

124
00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:17.834
<i>you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,</i>

125
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.378
<i>Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.</i>

126
00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.302
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

127
00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:33.683
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.

128
00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.853
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

129
00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:37.979
No.

130
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.190
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

131
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.236
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

132
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.990
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

133
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.409
Well, I gotta help you cross something.

134
00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.536
No. I'm doing fine.

135
00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:02.378
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."

136
00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:04.547
- Kid... Kid.
- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer

137
00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:09.218
- "in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
- I... Slow down. Kid!

138
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.554
- "Are you in need of any assistance..."
- Thank you,

139
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.181
- but I don't need any help!
- "...today, sir?"

140
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.058
Ow.

141
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.731
Proceed.

142
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.109
- "Good afternoon..."
- But skip to the end!

143
00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:30.031
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

144
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:35.244
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.041
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.752
"The wilderness must be explored !"

147
00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.921
Caw, caw! Raar!

148
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.799
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

149
00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:52.428
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

150
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.430
So, you want to assist an old person?

151
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.934
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

152
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.271
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

153
00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.398
Bird. Beady eyes.

154
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.444
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

155
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:14.283
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

156
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.745
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

157
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.790
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

158
00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.667
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

159
00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.127
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

160
00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:28.297
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

161
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.259
Here, snipey, snipey.

162
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.969
Bring it back here when you find it.

163
00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.136
Snipe!

164
00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.346
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

165
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:40.476
And stop. Stop. Stop!

166
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:45.189
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

167
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.816
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:49.318
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

169
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.987
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

170
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:53.155
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, I...

171
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:54.699
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:55.825
Ow!

173
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:08.671
Steve, you all right?

174
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.874
Sorry,
Mr. Fredricksen.

175
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.211
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

176
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:53.382
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

177
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.690
What do I do now, Ellie?

178
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.157
Morning, gentlemen.

179
00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:44.160
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

180
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.371
Ready as I'll ever be.

181
00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.832
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

182
00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.209
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.

183
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:56.630
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

184
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.508
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

185
00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:06.140
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

186
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:09.852
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

187
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:56.148
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

188
00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:45.447
Heh!

189
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.906
We're on our way, Ellie.

190
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:14.828
Huh?

191
00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:21.001
Hmm.

192
00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:40.062
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.

193
00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:42.147
What are you doing out here, kid?

194
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:45.985
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

195
00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:50.906
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

196
00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:58.414
Please let me in.

197
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.082
No.

198
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.839
Oh, alright, you can come...

199
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.258
...in.

200
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.056
Huh.

201
00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:21.270
I've never been
in a floating house before.

202
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:26.900
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

203
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:30.696
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

204
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:32.531
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

205
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:34.450
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

206
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:36.618
You know, most people take a plane,

207
00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:40.039
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

208
00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:43.083
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

209
00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.585
Does it really work?

210
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.087
Kid, would you stop with the...

211
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:48.714
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that...

212
00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.300
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

213
00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:53.427
Hey, look! Buildings.

214
00:25:54.094 --> 00:25:57.431
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

215
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:02.770
Wow! This is great!

216
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.314
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.

217
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:08.817
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

218
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:11.445
Hey! I can see your house from here.

219
00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:14.323
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

220
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.993
Well, that's not gonna work.

221
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.330
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

222
00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:22.498
Did you know that

223
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:24.249
the cumulonimbus forms

224
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:25.834
when warm air rises over cool air?

225
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.254
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

226
00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:30.464
...and that's how we get lightning.

227
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:31.965
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Fredricksen?

228
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.177
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

229
00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:38.931
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

230
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:42.851
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

231
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:56.657
See? Cumulonimbus.

232
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:33.735
My pack!

233
00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:39.908
Got ya!

234
00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.906
I thought you were dead.

235
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:23.076
What happened?

236
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.580
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

237
00:28:26.622 --> 00:28:27.748
Steered us?

238
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:30.584
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

239
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:32.711
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

240
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:34.504
Yeah. Sure.

241
00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:49.478
Can't tell where we are.

242
00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:51.605
Oh, we're in South America, all right.

243
00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:55.317
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

244
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:58.111
- GP... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

245
00:28:58.153 --> 00:29:00.489
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

246
00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:05.327
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

247
00:29:09.957 --> 00:29:10.999
Oops.

248
00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:14.962
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

249
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:18.090
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

250
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:21.843
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

251
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.349
There. That ought to do it.

252
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.268
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

253
00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:31.853
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

254
00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:35.607
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers

255
00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:37.359
to get back to my house.

256
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.827
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

257
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:50.706
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

258
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:55.168
That thing was... building or something.

259
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.672
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

260
00:29:58.714 --> 00:30:01.049
We can't be close to the ground yet.

261
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.894
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

262
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.689
Wait, wait. Wait!

263
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.864
- Russell, hang on ! Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa!

264
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:33.874
Aaaagggghhhhh!

265
00:30:34.082 --> 00:30:35.584
- Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

266
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.544
Come on. Come on.

267
00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.934
Where... Where are we?

268
00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:57.773
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

269
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.611
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

270
00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.429
There it is.

271
00:31:57.457 --> 00:32:00.001
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

272
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:03.964
We made it.

273
00:32:04.005 --> 00:32:08.802
We made it! Russell ! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

274
00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:10.303
You mean, assist you?

275
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.639
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

276
00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:20.355
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

277
00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:31.825
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

278
00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:34.161
Got it?

279
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:39.958
You on the porch yet?

280
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:48.383
What? That's it?

281
00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:54.055
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

282
00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:56.850
Great.

283
00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:05.567
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

284
00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:10.864
- What are you talking about?
- We could walk your house to the falls.

285
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:14.534
- Walk it?
- Yeah ! After all, we weigh it down.

286
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:17.913
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

287
00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:25.504
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly

288
00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:28.215
- with no rap music or flash dancing.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:33.094
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

290
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.680
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

291
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:38.099
- Sand.
- ...we're not getting to the falls.

292
00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:40.060
I found sand!

293
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:44.606
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

294
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.613
This is fun already, isn't it?

295
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:55.575
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

296
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.287
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

297
00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:01.540
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

298
00:34:01.623 --> 00:34:03.625
Caw, caw! Raar!

299
00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.587
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

300
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.756
Hey, let's play a game.

301
00:34:09.798 --> 00:34:13.051
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

302
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.971
Cool !
My mom loves that game!

303
00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:19.826
Darn thing!

304
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:23.538
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

305
00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:27.876
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

306
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.502
Which knee?

307
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:34.549
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

308
00:35:34.674 --> 00:35:37.385
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

309
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.680
Well, I didn't have to go then!

310
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:47.145
I don't wanna walk
anymore. Can we stop?

311
00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:50.357
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

312
00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:54.861
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

313
00:35:56.404 --> 00:36:00.158
Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

314
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.410
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

315
00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:07.040
I've always wanted to try this.

316
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:12.253
Mr. Fredricksen,

317
00:36:12.337 --> 00:36:15.382
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

318
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.009
None of my concern!

319
00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:21.596
Oh. It's before!

320
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.264
Bah !
La la la la la!

321
00:36:26.685 --> 00:36:27.727
Huh?

322
00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:31.022
Tracks?

323
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.358
Snipe.

324
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.905
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

325
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:41.700
Snipe.

326
00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:43.868
Huh?

327
00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:04.222
Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

328
00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:08.977
I am a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

329
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:11.271
Want some more?

330
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:17.944
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

331
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:24.492
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

332
00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:29.247
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

333
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:32.250
Giant snipe.

334
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:40.175
- I found the snipe!
- Oh ! Did you?

335
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:42.802
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes, they're very tall.

336
00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:45.930
- Do they have a lot of colors?
- They do, indeed!

337
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:49.768
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yes... chocolate?

338
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:55.356
- Gah ! What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

339
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.484
There's no such thing as a snipe!

340
00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:00.278
- But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
- Hey!

341
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.365
Go on ! Get out of here! Go on!

342
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:10.997
Whoa!

343
00:38:11.873 --> 00:38:13.291
Whoa!

344
00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:16.377
Careful, Russell!

345
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:20.381
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

346
00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:23.718
- Russell !
- No, stop! That tickles.

347
00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:26.971
Get out of here! Go on ! Get!

348
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:39.150
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin !
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

349
00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:42.403
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

350
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:47.742
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram !
Hey! That's mine!

351
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:54.249
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

352
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:57.043
Go on ! Beat it!

353
00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.591
Can we keep him? Please?

354
00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:07.595
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

355
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.763
No.

356
00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:14.102
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

357
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:16.938
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

358
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:19.941
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

359
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:24.112
Get down ! You're not allowed up there!

360
00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.950
You come down here right now!

361
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:33.121
Sheesh!

362
00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.290
Can you believe this, Ellie?

363
00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:36.457
Ellie?

364
00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:40.211
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

365
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.131
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

366
00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.592
She said for you to let me.

367
00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:47.468
But I told him no. I told you no!

368
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:48.970
N-O.

369
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:03.151
I see you back there.

370
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:08.990
Go on ! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

371
00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.658
Hey, are you okay over there?

372
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.915
Uh... Hello?

373
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.295
Oh!

374
00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:25.131
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

375
00:40:25.173 --> 00:40:27.634
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

376
00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:29.469
I can smell you.

377
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:33.181
What? You can smell us?

378
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.643
I can smell you.

379
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:45.026
Hey.

380
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:47.528
You were talking to a rock.

381
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.698
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

382
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:53.785
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

383
00:40:55.203 --> 00:40:57.205
- It is a dog !
- What?

384
00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:01.209
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

385
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.879
Hey, I like dogs.

386
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:06.631
We have your dog!

387
00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.050
- Whoa!
- Wonder who he belongs to.

388
00:41:09.175 --> 00:41:12.720
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

389
00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.138
Uh-huh.

390
00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:15.223
- Speak.
- Hi, there.

391
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.227
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

392
00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:20.520
Oh, yes.

393
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:24.649
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

394
00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:29.070
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

395
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:32.699
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

396
00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:35.910
My master is good and smart.

397
00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:37.078
It's not possible.

398
00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.664
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

399
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.749
- Cool ! What do these do, boy?
- Hey, would you...

400
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:44.085
I use that collar...

401
00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:47.588
...to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

402
00:41:47.714 --> 00:41:51.092
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

403
00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:52.510
I am a great tracker.

404
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:55.680
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

405
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:56.889
Have you seen a bird?

406
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:59.225
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

407
00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:01.436
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

408
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.272
Hey, that is the bird.

409
00:42:04.397 --> 00:42:07.275
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

410
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.902
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

411
00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:13.948
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

412
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:15.116
I can bark.

413
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.452
And here's howling.

414
00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:24.208
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

415
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:27.462
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

416
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:31.132
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

417
00:42:31.257 --> 00:42:32.633
Please be my prisoner.

418
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:35.303
Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!

419
00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:41.309
Oh ! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

420
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.728
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

421
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:45.646
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

422
00:42:45.772 --> 00:42:50.234
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream ! Who are they?

423
00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:52.653
Oh, man,
Master will not be pleased.

424
00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:55.782
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

425
00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:58.618
<i>No.</i>

426
00:42:58.659 --> 00:43:01.496
<i>Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.</i>

427
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.664
<i>Find the scent, my</i> compadres,

428
00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:05.500
<i>and you too shall
have much rewardings</i>

429
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.336
<i>from Master for the toil factor
you wage.</i>

430
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:12.131
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

431
00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:13.424
You must've bumped it.

432
00:43:13.508 --> 00:43:15.802
Yeah,
your voice sounds funny!

433
00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:23.684
<i>Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!</i>

434
00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.814
<i>Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking</i>

435
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.483
<i>that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.</i>

436
00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:34.320
No, no, no. But maybe
Dug would. You might wanna ask him.

437
00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:40.243
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.

438
00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:42.411
<i>Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.</i>

439
00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:47.750
<i>His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.</i>

440
00:43:49.794 --> 00:43:52.880
<i>Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?</i>

441
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:57.260
Sure, but the second Master
finds out you sent Dug out by himself,

442
00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:58.928
none of us will get a treat.

443
00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:02.140
<i>You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.</i>

444
00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:06.519
<i>This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.</i>

445
00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:09.438
<i>Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.</i>

446
00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:12.608
<i>I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?</i>

447
00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:15.444
<i>Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.</i>

448
00:44:15.528 --> 00:44:16.988
Yeah, right!

449
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:20.783
<i>Impossible! Where are you?</i>

450
00:44:20.867 --> 00:44:22.285
<i>I am here with the bird,</i>

451
00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:25.121
<i>and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.</i>

452
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:27.623
<i>- Gotta go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?</i>

453
00:44:27.707 --> 00:44:29.625
<i>- No, wait, wait!</i>
- What's Dug doing?

454
00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:31.544
Why's he with
that small mailman?

455
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.254
Where are they?

456
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.633
<i>There he is. Come on!</i>

457
00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:44.974
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

458
00:44:45.057 --> 00:44:46.475
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

459
00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:48.477
That man there says
I can take the bird,

460
00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:51.314
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

461
00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.481
I am not your master!

462
00:44:52.565 --> 00:44:54.108
I am warning you
once again, bird.

463
00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:56.194
- Hey! Quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird.

464
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:58.571
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

465
00:44:58.654 --> 00:44:59.989
Here, bird.

466
00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:09.874
I am nobody's master, got it?

467
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:12.418
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

468
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:13.794
I'm stuck with you!

469
00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:16.547
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

470
00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:19.175
A ball ! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

471
00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:22.678
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

472
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:24.639
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

473
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.766
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

474
00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:28.309
- Go get it!
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

475
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.228
I will get it and then bring it back!

476
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:31.854
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

477
00:45:31.938 --> 00:45:33.981
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

478
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.816
Bird. Bird!

479
00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.987
Come on, Russell.

480
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:42.698
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

481
00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:49.622
What are we doing?

482
00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:58.839
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

483
00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:06.472
I think that did the trick.

484
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:09.725
Hi, Master.

485
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:11.894
Afternoon.

486
00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:40.589
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

487
00:46:40.673 --> 00:46:42.550
Which one's the front?

488
00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:45.428
Oh, boy.

489
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:49.223
Is this step three or step five?

490
00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:52.768
There.

491
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:59.066
All done! That's for you.

492
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:06.490
Oh...

493
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.075
Tents are hard.

494
00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:13.873
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

495
00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:18.669
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

496
00:47:19.253 --> 00:47:22.089
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

497
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:26.135
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

498
00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:28.846
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

499
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.390
Well, never outside.

500
00:47:31.891 --> 00:47:35.311
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

501
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.606
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

502
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.317
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

503
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.736
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

504
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.446
He's gotta be home sometime.

505
00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:49.784
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

506
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:53.287
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

507
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:55.539
Phyllis isn't my mom.

508
00:47:57.792 --> 00:47:58.834
Oh.

509
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:10.096
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony

510
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:12.973
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.

511
00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:17.186
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

512
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.362
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

513
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:30.282
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

514
00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:33.828
Mr. Fredricksen?

515
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:36.789
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

516
00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:39.625
We have to protect him.

517
00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.879
Can Kevin go with us?

518
00:48:45.506 --> 00:48:47.425
All right, he can come.

519
00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:50.219
Promise you won't leave him?

520
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:52.847
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

521
00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:02.940
Cross my heart.

522
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:10.990
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

523
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.931
Morning, sweetheart.

524
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.685
We better get moving.

525
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:43.731
Bird's gone.

526
00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:47.401
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

527
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:52.698
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin ! Dug, find Kevin!

528
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:56.619
Find the bird, find the bird !
Hi, hi. Point!

529
00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.579
Look. There he is!

530
00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.166
Point!

531
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:06.212
Hey! That's my food ! Get off my roof!

532
00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:07.546
Yeah, get off of his...

533
00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:14.220
What is it doing?

534
00:50:14.303 --> 00:50:16.722
The bird is calling to her babies.

535
00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.308
Her babies.

536
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.228
Kevin's a girl?

537
00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:27.358
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

538
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:32.029
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

539
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.949
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

540
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:40.037
But you promised to protect her.

541
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.415
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

542
00:50:43.499 --> 00:50:46.544
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

543
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:49.129
Yeah.

544
00:50:56.804 --> 00:50:59.515
This was her favorite chocolate.

545
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.186
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

546
00:51:05.854 --> 00:51:06.897
Huh?

547
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:08.148
Kevin?

548
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:29.753
<i>Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.</i>

549
00:51:29.837 --> 00:51:31.046
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

550
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:34.174
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

551
00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:37.344
<i>- Where is it?</i>
- Uh... Tomorrow.

552
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:41.307
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

553
00:51:42.558 --> 00:51:46.228
<i>You lost it!
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?</i>

554
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.024
<i>Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman</i>

555
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:52.610
<i>and the one who smells of prunes.</i>

556
00:51:54.278 --> 00:51:56.780
<i>Master will be most pleased
we have found them</i>

557
00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:59.783
<i>and will ask of them many questions.
Come!</i>

558
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:03.412
Wait. We're not going with you !
We're going to the falls!

559
00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:07.041
Get away from me!

560
00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:12.171
Get down!

561
00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:07.601
Stay!

562
00:53:15.818 --> 00:53:18.404
You came here in that?

563
00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:20.155
Uh, yeah.

564
00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:24.743
In a house? A floating house?

565
00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:36.088
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

566
00:53:36.672 --> 00:53:39.216
You're not after my bird, are you?

567
00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:42.177
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

568
00:53:42.261 --> 00:53:44.513
I'd be happy to oblige.

569
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:50.477
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

570
00:53:50.936 --> 00:53:52.771
My dogs made a mistake.

571
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.774
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

572
00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:58.485
Yeah, well, yes.

573
00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:00.696
THE Charles Muntz?

574
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.990
"Adventure is out there!"

575
00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:06.618
It's really him ! That's Charles Muntz!

576
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.289
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

577
00:54:10.372 --> 00:54:12.207
- Yes! Yes! That's him !
- I'm Carl Fredricksen.

578
00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:15.127
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

579
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.962
Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.

580
00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:21.467
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

581
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:22.593
Uh-huh.

582
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:24.136
Now, attention, everyone!

583
00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:28.056
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

584
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.644
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

585
00:54:32.728 --> 00:54:34.438
You do smell like prunes.

586
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:35.564
Whoa!

587
00:54:37.191 --> 00:54:38.317
I will not bite you.

588
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.861
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

589
00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:44.281
I'm sorry about the dogs.

590
00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:47.367
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
- We weren't.

591
00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.913
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

592
00:54:56.543 --> 00:55:00.130
We're not actually going inside
the <i>Spirit of Adventure</i> itself?

593
00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:01.256
Oh...

594
00:55:01.507 --> 00:55:03.091
Would you like to?

595
00:55:03.175 --> 00:55:04.426
Would I?

596
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:08.430
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

597
00:55:09.264 --> 00:55:10.808
Jiminy Cricket.

598
00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.185
- Not you.
- What do we do with Dug?

599
00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:17.022
<i>He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.</i>

600
00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.321
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

601
00:55:25.697 --> 00:55:29.952
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

602
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:33.789
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

603
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:37.000
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

604
00:55:37.084 --> 00:55:39.586
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

605
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.381
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

606
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:45.217
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

607
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.010
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

608
00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:49.513
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

609
00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:52.558
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

610
00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:56.353
Oh, my gosh !
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

611
00:55:56.436 --> 00:55:59.314
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

612
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:01.692
That's an interesting story there.

613
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:03.819
Excellent choice.

614
00:56:03.902 --> 00:56:07.698
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

615
00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:11.660
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

616
00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.579
and did he cheat!

617
00:56:13.662 --> 00:56:15.914
Oh, he was horrible.

618
00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.167
<i>Master, dinner is ready.</i>

619
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:21.628
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

620
00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:26.300
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

621
00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.759
Thank you, Master.

622
00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:30.053
I liked his other voice.

623
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:34.558
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

624
00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:38.854
So, how are things stateside, huh?

625
00:56:38.937 --> 00:56:41.356
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

626
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.027
but I have unfinished work here.

627
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.113
Please. I hope you're hungry,

628
00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:52.492
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

629
00:56:57.289 --> 00:57:00.292
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

630
00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:01.418
Yes!

631
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:04.963
Hey! Hey!

632
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.425
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

633
00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:10.969
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

634
00:57:11.053 --> 00:57:13.722
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

635
00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:16.350
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

636
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:18.894
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

637
00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:23.023
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

638
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.524
- Treat! Where's the treat!
- Treat!

639
00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:27.653
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

640
00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:29.154
- I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

641
00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:30.822
I shouldn't have used that word.

642
00:57:30.906 --> 00:57:33.659
Having guests is a delight.

643
00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:37.621
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

644
00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:38.747
No!

645
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.752
They called me a fraud, those...

646
00:57:46.338 --> 00:57:50.258
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

647
00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.136
Beautiful, isn't it?

648
00:57:55.806 --> 00:57:58.475
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

649
00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:04.272
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

650
00:58:05.232 --> 00:58:09.820
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

651
00:58:10.654 --> 00:58:12.322
You can't go in after it.

652
00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:15.033
Once in, there's no way out.

653
00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:17.619
I've lost so many dogs.

654
00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:24.793
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

655
00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:30.507
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

656
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.345
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

657
00:58:37.389 --> 00:58:40.225
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

658
00:58:40.308 --> 00:58:42.394
I trained it to follow us.

659
00:58:42.477 --> 00:58:45.689
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

660
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:48.608
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

661
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:52.612
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

662
00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.615
But it ran off. It's gone now.

663
00:59:02.456 --> 00:59:07.044
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

664
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:09.713
they all tell pretty good stories.

665
00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:14.676
A surveyor making a map.

666
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:18.805
A botanist cataloguing plants.

667
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:27.564
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

668
00:59:34.112 --> 00:59:38.241
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

669
00:59:47.876 --> 00:59:51.505
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

670
00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:52.923
Oh, you're not leaving.

671
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:56.635
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

672
00:59:56.718 --> 00:59:59.930
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

673
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.933
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

674
01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:07.646
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

675
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.942
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

676
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.945
We have so much more to talk about.

677
01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.450
Kevin?

678
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.543
It's here.

679
01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:32.754
Get them!

680
01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.926
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

681
01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.303
Ahhh ! They're coming!

682
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.016
Master, over here.

683
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.826
Go toward the light, Master!

684
01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.064
Russell!

685
01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.987
Get back!

686
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.535
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

687
01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.371
Stop, you dogs.

688
01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.717
Whoa!

689
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:17.859
Help!

690
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.694
Help!

691
01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.363
Help!

692
01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.951
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

693
01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.911
Give me your hand!

694
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.966
Hang on to Kevin!

695
01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:13.915
Kevin.

696
01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.568
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

697
01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:46.865
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

698
01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.420
All right, but we gotta hurry.

699
01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.553
You lost them?

700
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.804
No, it was Dug.

701
01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:13.224
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

702
01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:15.643
Wait.

703
01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.563
Wait a minute. Dug.

704
01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.279
See anything?

705
01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.824
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

706
01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:31.368
This is crazy.

707
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:35.038
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

708
01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:36.498
Hey, I know a joke.

709
01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.500
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

710
01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:41.795
"I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead."

711
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.215
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

712
01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.553
Careful, Russell.

713
01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.222
You okay, Kevin?

714
01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.562
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

715
01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.524
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

716
01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.234
Yeah? How so?

717
01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.820
It's kind of wild.

718
01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:10.573
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

719
01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.575
Get used to that, kid.

720
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.078
My dad made it sound so easy.

721
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.247
He's really good at camping

722
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.417
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

723
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.211
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

724
01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:27.173
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

725
01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:30.427
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickie.

726
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.513
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

727
01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:37.392
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

728
01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:41.062
and whoever gets the most wins.

729
01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.567
I like that curb.

730
01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.572
That might sound boring,

731
01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:55.118
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

732
01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.461
Look! There it is!

733
01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:08.631
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

734
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:22.812
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

735
01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:27.567
That's it. Go, Kevin !
Go find your babies!

736
01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.948
Run, Kevin ! Run!

737
01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.119
Oh, no!

738
01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.585
Russell, give me your knife!

739
01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:49.589
Get away from my bird!

740
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:16.991
No!

741
01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:24.958
No!

742
01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.175
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

743
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.888
Let her go! Stop!

744
01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.644
Kevin!

745
01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:00.159
You gave away Kevin.

746
01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.832
You just gave her away.

747
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:13.256
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

748
01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.678
Master, it's alright.

749
01:08:19.512 --> 01:08:21.389
I am not your master!

750
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.226
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

751
01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:27.604
Bad dog ! Bad dog!

752
01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:38.031
Now, whether you assist me or not,

753
01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:42.118
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

754
01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:58.111
Here. I don't want this anymore.

755
01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:39.832
Russell?

756
01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:45.880
Russell!

757
01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:49.508
I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!

758
01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.845
No, Russell ! No!

759
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.543
Huh?

760
01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:06.752
Russell?

761
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.047
Dug!

762
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:14.927
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

763
01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.430
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

764
01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.806
And I'm your master.

765
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.433
You're my master?

766
01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:21.809
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

767
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.687
Good boy, Dug !
You're a good boy!

768
01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.630
Yes!

769
01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.468
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

770
01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:09.482
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

771
01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.775
Master?

772
01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:14.320
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

773
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.322
Let me go.

774
01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:20.284
Where's your elderly friend?

775
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.205
He's not my friend anymore.

776
01:16:24.705 --> 01:16:28.167
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

777
01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:31.337
Where are you
keeping Kevin?

778
01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:33.714
Let me go!

779
01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:36.008
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

780
01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:38.511
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

781
01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:42.681
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

782
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.187
Alpha,
Fredricksen's coming back.

783
01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:51.899
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

784
01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:55.361
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

785
01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.321
Nice talking with you.

786
01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:01.575
Ahhh!

787
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.370
Where are you, Fredricksen?

788
01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.223
Russell!

789
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:39.405
- Mr. Fredricksen !
- Dug, bring her over!

790
01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.784
You came back for Kevin !
Let's go get her!

791
01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:46.078
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

792
01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:47.413
But I wanna help.

793
01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:48.747
I don't want your help.

794
01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:50.583
I want you safe.

795
01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.092
How do we get past these dogs?

796
01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:01.802
Point!

797
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.439
Kevin.

798
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:17.109
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

799
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.738
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

800
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.824
Guard well that bird, my minions.

801
01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:26.160
What do we do now, Dug?

802
01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.300
Who wants the ball?

803
01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.303
- Me! I want it!
- Me! I do!

804
01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.013
- I want the ball !
- Give it to me!

805
01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.431
Then go get it!

806
01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.850
I'm gonna get there first!

807
01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.352
Getting the ball!

808
01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.937
I got it!

809
01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:54.313
Uh-oh.

810
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.111
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

811
01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:03.155
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

812
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.323
He's here!

813
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.492
- He's got the bird !
- The bird's gone...

814
01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:08.619
Calm down ! One at a time!

815
01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.875
I... want... to... help!

816
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.001
Ha-ha!

817
01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.012
- He's in Hall D!
- He's in Hall C!

818
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.514
It's the old man!

819
01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:31.976
Does anyone know where they are?

820
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.743
Gray Leader? Take down the house.

821
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.793
Gray Leader, checking in.

822
01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:58.877
Gray Two, checking in.

823
01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:00.170
Gray Three, checking in.

824
01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.010
Target sighted.

825
01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.020
Come on, Kevin.

826
01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.361
Auuggghh!

827
01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:32.244
Hi.

828
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.857
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on !
Spit it out!

829
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.863
- Come on.
- Enough!

830
01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:12.910
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

831
01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.896
Come on, Kevin.

832
01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:03.085
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

833
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:12.970
He wears the Cone of Shame!

834
01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.932
<i>What?
Do not just continue sitting. Attack!</i>

835
01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:23.313
<i>No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!</i>

836
01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.274
Listen, you dog. Sit!

837
01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.110
Yes, Alpha.

838
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.821
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

839
01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.239
Oh!

840
01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.576
I can't do it.

841
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.163
- Russell !
- Huh?

842
01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:42.749
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

843
01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.170
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

844
01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.771
Hey, squirrel!

845
01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.857
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

846
01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.275
Where's the squirrel?

847
01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.780
I hate squirrels.

848
01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:35.552
Dug!

849
01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.262
Master!

850
01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:41.642
Russell ! Over here! Let's go!

851
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.315
Mr. Fredricksen!

852
01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:50.526
Go on, Kevin!

853
01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:06.583
No!

854
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.767
Russell ! Get out of there!

855
01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.896
No! Leave them alone!

856
01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:47.374
Russell, hang on to Kevin !
Don't let go of her!

857
01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:51.545
Kevin ! Chocolate!

858
01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.694
That was cool!

859
01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:22.117
Don't jerk around so much, kid !
Easy, Russell.

860
01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.913
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

861
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.939
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

862
01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:58.362
You know, it's just a house.

863
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.580
Look at you. You're so soft.

864
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.751
Aw!

865
01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.628
I wish I could keep one.

866
01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.051
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

867
01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:32.646
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

868
01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.065
Bye, Kevin!

869
01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:45.784
Ready?

870
01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.494
Ready.

871
01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:00.006
<i>And by receiving
their badges,</i>

872
01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:04.761
<i>the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.</i>

873
01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:08.974
<i>For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.</i>

874
01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:13.687
<i>For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.</i>

875
01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:16.356
<i>For Assisting the Elderly...</i>

876
01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:20.360
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

877
01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:26.199
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

878
01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:30.537
I'm here for him.

879
01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.998
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

880
01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:39.254
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

881
01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:43.925
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

882
01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:49.181
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

883
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:53.310
The Ellie badge.

884
01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:57.397
Wow.

885
01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.613
<i>All right,
I think that covers everybody.</i>

886
01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:06.740
<i>So let's give a big Explorer call</i>

887
01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:10.535
<i>to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.</i>

888
01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:11.912
<i>Ready, everybody?</i>

889
01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.538
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

890
01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:22.297
- Blue one.
- Red one.

891
01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.758
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

892
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.719
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

893
01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.805
It's red, isn't it?

894
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.765
Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

895
01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.767
No, I'm not. Red one.

896
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.644
That's a fire hydrant.

897
01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:39.815
Maybe I need new glasses.

898
01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.775
