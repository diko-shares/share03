<i>What you are now witnessing</i>

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:55.313
<i>is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,</i>

4
00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:57.074
<i>a lost world in South America.</i>

5
00:00:57.153 --> 00:00:59.273
<i>Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,</i>

6
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:02.193
<i>it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.</i>

7
00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:05.393
<i>Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?</i>

8
00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:09.233
<i>Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!</i>

9
00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.273
<i>The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible, the Spirit of Adventure,</i>

10
00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:13.713
<i>in New Hampshire this week,</i>

11
00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:16.712
<i>completing a yearlong expedition
to the lost world.</i>

12
00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.592
<i>This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself</i>

13
00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:23.473
<i>and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.</i>

14
00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:26.192
<i>And here comes the adventurer now.</i>

15
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.352
<i>Never apart from his faithful dogs,</i>

16
00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:30.633
<i>Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.</i>

17
00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.672
<i>It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,</i>

18
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:36.072
<i>complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.</i>

19
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:40.192
<i>And, Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.</i>

20
00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:41.552
<i>And how!</i>

21
00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.912
<i>Adventure is out there!</i>

22
00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:48.432
<i>But what
has Muntz brought back this time?</i>

23
00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:53.072
<i>Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!</i>

24
00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:57.872
<i>And, golly, what a swell monster this is!</i>

25
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.512
<i>But what's this? Scientists cry foul.</i>

26
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.672
<i>The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz</i>

27
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:04.431
<i>of fabricating the skeleton.</i>

28
00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:05.632
No!

29
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:07.392
<i>The organization strips Muntz</i>

30
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:08.592
<i>of his membership.</i>

31
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.031
<i>Humiliated,
Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls</i>

32
00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:16.911
<i>and promises
to capture the beast alive!</i>

33
00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:19.592
<i>I promise to capture the beast alive,</i>

34
00:02:20.592 --> 00:02:23.231
<i>and I will not come back until I do!</i>

35
00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:27.111
<i>And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.</i>

36
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.831
<i>Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,</i>

37
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:33.151
<i>and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!</i>

38
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:41.071
<i>Here's Charles Muntz</i>

39
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:43.311
<i>piloting his famous dirigible.</i>

40
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.191
<i>He hurdles Pikes Peak.</i>

41
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.191
<i>He hurdles the Grand Canyon.</i>

42
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.071
<i>He hurdles Mount Everest.</i>

43
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.510
<i>He goes around Mount Everest.</i>

44
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.311
<i>Is there nothing he cannot do?</i>

45
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.550
<i>Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is..."</i>

46
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:10.950
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.830
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.631
<i>Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!</i>

49
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.630
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.830
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.590
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.310
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.710
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.869
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.390
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.870
- What are you doing?
- Ahhh!

57
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.750
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.710
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:00.550
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.430
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.109
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.949
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.269
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.869
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:29.388
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.229
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:36.709
There it is.

68
00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.548
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:48.708
Go on.

70
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.308
Ow.

71
00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:10.668
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:13.868
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.708
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:20.228
I am about to let you
see something

75
00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:22.948
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:23.388 --> 00:05:25.308
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.428
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:32.668
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:37.388
My Adventure Book.

80
00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:40.547
You know him.

81
00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.147
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:47.147
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:05:47.987 --> 00:05:52.587
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:55.147
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:59.907
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

86
00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:04.107
I ripped this right out of a library book.

87
00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:08.666
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:09.187 --> 00:06:11.266
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:13.387
And once I get there?

90
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:17.267
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:22.986
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

92
00:06:29.706 --> 00:06:32.386
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:35.306
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

94
00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:40.226
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:43.627
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:47.546
Adventure is out there!

97
00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.226
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:06:52.106 --> 00:06:53.346
I like you!

99
00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:57.026
Wow.

100
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.541
Hah!

101
00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:08.139
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:12.178
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

103
00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:17.778
Uh! Mail's here.

104
00:13:30.298 --> 00:13:34.377
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh, brother.

105
00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:37.458
Hmm...

106
00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.297
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

107
00:13:46.737 --> 00:13:48.178
No. Yes!

108
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:52.298
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

109
00:13:52.337 --> 00:13:53.777
Well, just to let you know,

110
00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:56.337
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

111
00:13:56.457 --> 00:13:58.737
and for double his last offer!

112
00:13:58.937 --> 00:13:59.977
What do you say to that?

113
00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:04.377
Uh, I take that as a "no," then?

114
00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:07.697
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

115
00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:10.257
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

116
00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:13.337
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

117
00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:20.697
<i>You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!</i>

118
00:14:21.577 --> 00:14:23.097
<i>I am not with him!</i>

119
00:14:23.417 --> 00:14:26.616
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

120
00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:29.577
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

121
00:14:29.977 --> 00:14:32.016
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

122
00:14:33.896 --> 00:14:35.696
I'll take that as a maybe.

123
00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.937
<i>Order now,
you get the camera,</i>

124
00:14:38.056 --> 00:14:41.137
<i>you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,</i>

125
00:14:41.176 --> 00:14:43.577
<i>Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.</i>

126
00:14:48.376 --> 00:14:51.176
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

127
00:14:51.496 --> 00:14:56.336
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.

128
00:14:56.696 --> 00:14:59.376
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

129
00:14:59.416 --> 00:15:00.456
No.

130
00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:03.536
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

131
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:07.416
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

132
00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:11.016
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

133
00:15:11.376 --> 00:15:13.336
Well, I gotta help you cross something.

134
00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:15.376
No. I'm doing fine.

135
00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:23.855
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."

136
00:15:24.976 --> 00:15:25.936
- Kid... Kid.
- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer

137
00:15:27.056 --> 00:15:30.415
- "in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
- I... Slow down. Kid!

138
00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:32.655
- "Are you in need of any assistance..."
- Thank you,

139
00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:34.216
- but I don't need any help!
- "...today, sir?"

140
00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:36.975
Ow.

141
00:15:41.135 --> 00:15:42.415
Proceed.

142
00:15:43.095 --> 00:15:45.655
- "Good afternoon..."
- But skip to the end!

143
00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:50.375
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

144
00:15:50.855 --> 00:15:55.375
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:15:55.735 --> 00:15:59.975
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:02.575
"The wilderness must be explored!"

147
00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.655
Caw, caw! Raar!

148
00:16:05.815 --> 00:16:08.374
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

149
00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:11.854
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

150
00:16:11.895 --> 00:16:13.774
So, you want to assist an old person?

151
00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:17.135
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

152
00:16:18.574 --> 00:16:21.294
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

153
00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.334
Bird. Beady eyes.

154
00:16:23.374 --> 00:16:27.214
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

155
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:32.814
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

156
00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:36.134
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

157
00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.054
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

158
00:16:39.174 --> 00:16:40.854
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

159
00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:43.214
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

160
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:46.254
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

161
00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:49.094
Here, snipey, snipey.

162
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:50.734
Bring it back here when you find it.

163
00:16:50.854 --> 00:16:51.853
Snipe!

164
00:16:51.974 --> 00:16:53.014
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

165
00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:57.934
And stop. Stop. Stop!

166
00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:02.453
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

167
00:17:02.573 --> 00:17:04.014
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:17:04.053 --> 00:17:06.413
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

169
00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:08.014
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

170
00:17:08.053 --> 00:17:10.093
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, I...

171
00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:11.574
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:17:11.694 --> 00:17:12.654
Ow!

173
00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:24.973
Steve, you all right?

174
00:17:58.132 --> 00:17:59.693
Sorry,
Mr. Fredricksen.

175
00:18:00.332 --> 00:18:03.852
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

176
00:18:04.373 --> 00:18:07.852
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

177
00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:23.492
What do I do now, Ellie?

178
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.210
Morning, gentlemen.

179
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.090
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

180
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.170
Ready as I'll ever be.

181
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.530
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

182
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.810
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.

183
00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:06.049
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

184
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.809
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

185
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.170
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

186
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.730
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

187
00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:03.128
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

188
00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:50.407
Heh!

189
00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:30.167
We're on our way, Ellie.

190
00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:16.126
Huh?

191
00:23:21.046 --> 00:23:22.046
Hmm.

192
00:23:37.046 --> 00:23:40.326
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell.

193
00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:42.325
What are you doing out here, kid?

194
00:23:42.406 --> 00:23:46.006
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

195
00:23:46.085 --> 00:23:50.725
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

196
00:23:56.286 --> 00:23:57.925
Please let me in.

197
00:23:58.405 --> 00:23:59.525
No.

198
00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:06.005
Oh, alright, you can come...

199
00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:08.325
...in.

200
00:24:13.845 --> 00:24:14.845
Huh.

201
00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:19.845
I've never been
in a floating house before.

202
00:24:21.284 --> 00:24:25.244
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

203
00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:28.885
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

204
00:24:28.964 --> 00:24:30.644
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

205
00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:32.485
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

206
00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:34.564
You know, most people take a plane,

207
00:24:34.644 --> 00:24:37.845
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

208
00:24:37.924 --> 00:24:40.764
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

209
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:42.204
Does it really work?

210
00:24:43.364 --> 00:24:44.604
Kid, would you stop with the...

211
00:24:44.644 --> 00:24:46.164
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that...

212
00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:48.644
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

213
00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:50.684
Hey, look! Buildings.

214
00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:54.524
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

215
00:24:57.603 --> 00:24:59.644
Wow! This is great!

216
00:25:00.004 --> 00:25:02.084
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.

217
00:25:02.204 --> 00:25:05.443
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

218
00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:07.964
Hey! I can see your house from here.

219
00:25:08.603 --> 00:25:10.724
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

220
00:25:12.764 --> 00:25:14.243
Well, that's not gonna work.

221
00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:17.444
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

222
00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:18.564
Did you know that

223
00:25:18.964 --> 00:25:20.243
the cumulonimbus forms

224
00:25:20.803 --> 00:25:21.763
when warm air rises over cool air?

225
00:25:21.883 --> 00:25:25.043
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

226
00:25:25.124 --> 00:25:26.203
...and that's how we get lightning.

227
00:25:26.244 --> 00:25:27.643
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Fredricksen?

228
00:25:28.803 --> 00:25:30.723
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

229
00:25:30.843 --> 00:25:34.323
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

230
00:25:35.683 --> 00:25:38.083
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

231
00:25:49.243 --> 00:25:51.323
See? Cumulonimbus.

232
00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:26.882
My pack!

233
00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:32.802
Got ya!

234
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.202
I thought you were dead.

235
00:27:13.082 --> 00:27:14.201
What happened?

236
00:27:14.241 --> 00:27:17.561
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

237
00:27:17.601 --> 00:27:18.681
Steered us?

238
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.401
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

239
00:27:21.441 --> 00:27:23.441
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

240
00:27:23.921 --> 00:27:25.160
Yeah. Sure.

241
00:27:37.881 --> 00:27:39.521
Can't tell where we are.

242
00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:41.561
Oh, we're in South America, all right.

243
00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:45.121
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

244
00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:47.800
- GP... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

245
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.081
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

246
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.720
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

247
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:00.160
Oops.

248
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.961
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

249
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.960
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

250
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.560
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

251
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.840
There. That ought to do it.

252
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.680
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

253
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.159
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

254
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.760
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers

255
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.440
to get back to my house.

256
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:34.520
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

257
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:38.240
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

258
00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:42.519
That thing was... building or something.

259
00:28:43.959 --> 00:28:45.879
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

260
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.159
We can't be close to the ground yet.

261
00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:59.519
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

262
00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:02.199
Wait, wait. Wait!

263
00:29:07.478 --> 00:29:10.039
- Russell, hang on! Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa!

264
00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:19.639
Aaaagggghhhhh!

265
00:29:19.838 --> 00:29:21.279
- Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

266
00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:23.158
Come on. Come on.

267
00:29:35.159 --> 00:29:37.918
Where... Where are we?

268
00:29:38.238 --> 00:29:42.558
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

269
00:29:44.918 --> 00:29:47.198
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

270
00:30:11.438 --> 00:30:12.917
There it is.

271
00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:42.236
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

272
00:30:44.436 --> 00:30:46.037
We made it.

273
00:30:46.076 --> 00:30:50.677
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

274
00:30:50.717 --> 00:30:52.116
You mean, assist you?

275
00:30:52.157 --> 00:30:54.357
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

276
00:30:59.956 --> 00:31:01.756
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

277
00:31:08.756 --> 00:31:12.756
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

278
00:31:13.716 --> 00:31:14.997
Got it?

279
00:31:18.837 --> 00:31:20.556
You on the porch yet?

280
00:31:27.036 --> 00:31:28.636
What? That's it?

281
00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:34.075
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

282
00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:36.756
Great.

283
00:31:40.476 --> 00:31:45.116
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

284
00:31:46.076 --> 00:31:50.196
- What are you talking about?
- We could walk your house to the falls.

285
00:31:50.236 --> 00:31:53.715
- Walk it?
- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

286
00:31:53.756 --> 00:31:56.956
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

287
00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:04.236
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly

288
00:32:04.315 --> 00:32:06.836
- with no rap music or flash dancing.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:32:07.116 --> 00:32:11.515
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

290
00:32:11.636 --> 00:32:13.995
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

291
00:32:14.075 --> 00:32:16.315
- Sand.
- ...we're not getting to the falls.

292
00:32:16.395 --> 00:32:18.195
I found sand!

293
00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:22.555
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

294
00:32:26.874 --> 00:32:29.275
This is fun already, isn't it?

295
00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:33.074
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

296
00:32:33.194 --> 00:32:36.634
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

297
00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.795
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

298
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:40.795
Caw, caw! Raar!

299
00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:44.594
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

300
00:32:44.634 --> 00:32:46.674
Hey, let's play a game.

301
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:49.834
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

302
00:32:49.914 --> 00:32:52.635
Cool!
My mom loves that game!

303
00:33:52.473 --> 00:33:53.873
Darn thing!

304
00:33:55.673 --> 00:33:57.433
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

305
00:33:57.513 --> 00:34:01.593
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

306
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.152
Which knee?

307
00:34:03.753 --> 00:34:07.993
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

308
00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:10.712
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

309
00:34:10.832 --> 00:34:13.872
Well, I didn't have to go then!

310
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:20.072
I don't wanna walk
anymore. Can we stop?

311
00:34:20.152 --> 00:34:23.153
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

312
00:34:23.192 --> 00:34:27.472
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

313
00:34:28.952 --> 00:34:32.552
Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

314
00:34:32.632 --> 00:34:34.712
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

315
00:34:36.873 --> 00:34:39.152
I've always wanted to try this.

316
00:34:42.832 --> 00:34:44.152
Mr. Fredricksen,

317
00:34:44.232 --> 00:34:47.152
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

318
00:34:48.312 --> 00:34:49.672
None of my concern!

319
00:34:50.992 --> 00:34:53.112
Oh. It's before!

320
00:34:53.192 --> 00:34:54.711
Bah!
La la la la la!

321
00:34:57.992 --> 00:34:58.991
Huh?

322
00:35:00.552 --> 00:35:02.151
Tracks?

323
00:35:03.272 --> 00:35:04.392
Snipe.

324
00:35:06.072 --> 00:35:09.711
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

325
00:35:10.832 --> 00:35:12.392
Snipe.

326
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:14.471
Huh?

327
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:33.991
Ha! Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

328
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:38.551
I am a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

329
00:35:39.111 --> 00:35:40.751
Want some more?

330
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:47.151
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

331
00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:53.430
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

332
00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:57.990
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

333
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.870
Giant snipe.

334
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.471
- I found the snipe!
- Oh! Did you?

335
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.990
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes, they're very tall.

336
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.990
- Do they have a lot of colors?
- They do, indeed!

337
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.671
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yes... chocolate?

338
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.030
- Gah! What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

339
00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.070
There's no such thing as a snipe!

340
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.750
- But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
- Hey!

341
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.669
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

342
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.030
Whoa!

343
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.230
Whoa!

344
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.189
Careful, Russell!

345
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.029
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

346
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.229
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles.

347
00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:53.349
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

348
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:05.029
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

349
00:37:05.429 --> 00:37:08.149
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

350
00:37:09.669 --> 00:37:13.269
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

351
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.509
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

352
00:37:20.628 --> 00:37:22.189
Go on! Beat it!

353
00:37:26.989 --> 00:37:28.468
Can we keep him? Please?

354
00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:32.308
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

355
00:37:32.389 --> 00:37:33.428
No.

356
00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:38.549
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

357
00:37:38.868 --> 00:37:41.268
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

358
00:37:42.068 --> 00:37:44.148
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

359
00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:48.148
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

360
00:37:50.629 --> 00:37:52.788
You come down here right now!

361
00:37:55.748 --> 00:37:56.788
Sheesh!

362
00:37:56.908 --> 00:37:58.868
Can you believe this, Ellie?

363
00:37:58.988 --> 00:37:59.988
Ellie?

364
00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:03.588
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

365
00:38:04.628 --> 00:38:06.388
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

366
00:38:07.108 --> 00:38:08.748
She said for you to let me.

367
00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:10.547
But I told him no. I told you no!

368
00:38:10.868 --> 00:38:11.988
N- O.

369
00:38:23.987 --> 00:38:25.588
I see you back there.

370
00:38:27.508 --> 00:38:31.187
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

371
00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:32.787
Hey, are you okay over there?

372
00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:38.788
Uh... Hello?

373
00:38:42.947 --> 00:38:43.947
Oh!

374
00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:46.667
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

375
00:38:46.707 --> 00:38:49.067
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

376
00:38:49.107 --> 00:38:50.827
I can smell you.

377
00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:54.387
What? You can smell us?

378
00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.707
I can smell you.

379
00:39:04.707 --> 00:39:05.747
Hey.

380
00:39:05.826 --> 00:39:08.146
You were talking to a rock.

381
00:39:09.587 --> 00:39:11.186
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

382
00:39:11.267 --> 00:39:14.147
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

383
00:39:15.507 --> 00:39:17.427
- It is a dog!
- What?

384
00:39:18.306 --> 00:39:21.267
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

385
00:39:22.826 --> 00:39:24.786
Hey, I like dogs.

386
00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:26.466
We have your dog!

387
00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:28.786
- Whoa!
- Wonder who he belongs to.

388
00:39:28.906 --> 00:39:32.306
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

389
00:39:32.626 --> 00:39:33.666
Uh-huh.

390
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:34.706
- Speak.
- Hi, there.

391
00:39:36.266 --> 00:39:38.546
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

392
00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:39.786
Oh, yes.

393
00:39:40.466 --> 00:39:43.746
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

394
00:39:44.906 --> 00:39:47.986
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

395
00:39:48.106 --> 00:39:51.466
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

396
00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.546
My master is good and smart.

397
00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:55.666
It's not possible.

398
00:39:55.786 --> 00:39:58.146
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

399
00:39:58.225 --> 00:40:00.145
- Cool! What do these do, boy?
- Hey, would you...

400
00:40:01.346 --> 00:40:02.386
I use that collar...

401
00:40:03.626 --> 00:40:05.745
...to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

402
00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:09.105
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

403
00:40:09.225 --> 00:40:10.465
I am a great tracker.

404
00:40:10.545 --> 00:40:13.505
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

405
00:40:13.585 --> 00:40:14.665
Have you seen a bird?

406
00:40:14.705 --> 00:40:16.905
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

407
00:40:16.945 --> 00:40:19.026
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

408
00:40:20.465 --> 00:40:21.745
Hey, that is the bird.

409
00:40:21.865 --> 00:40:24.625
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

410
00:40:24.745 --> 00:40:27.145
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

411
00:40:27.185 --> 00:40:31.025
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

412
00:40:31.145 --> 00:40:32.145
I can bark.

413
00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:34.385
And here's howling.

414
00:40:38.384 --> 00:40:40.864
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

415
00:40:40.945 --> 00:40:43.985
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

416
00:40:44.105 --> 00:40:47.505
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

417
00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:48.944
Please be my prisoner.

418
00:40:49.345 --> 00:40:51.505
Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!

419
00:40:54.064 --> 00:40:57.265
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

420
00:40:57.344 --> 00:40:59.585
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

421
00:40:59.905 --> 00:41:01.424
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

422
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:05.824
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream! Who are they?

423
00:41:06.304 --> 00:41:08.144
Oh, man,
Master will not be pleased.

424
00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:11.145
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

425
00:41:12.784 --> 00:41:13.864
<i>No.</i>

426
00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:16.624
<i>Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.</i>

427
00:41:17.104 --> 00:41:18.704
<i>Find the scent, my compadres,</i>

428
00:41:18.784 --> 00:41:20.464
<i>and you too shall
have much rewardings</i>

429
00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:23.184
<i>from Master for the toil factor
you wage.</i>

430
00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:26.824
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

431
00:41:26.864 --> 00:41:28.064
You must've bumped it.

432
00:41:28.144 --> 00:41:30.344
Yeah,
your voice sounds funny!

433
00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:37.903
<i>Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!</i>

434
00:41:39.823 --> 00:41:41.864
<i>Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking</i>

435
00:41:41.903 --> 00:41:44.424
<i>that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.</i>

436
00:41:44.464 --> 00:41:48.103
No, no, no. But maybe
Dug would. You might wanna ask him.

437
00:41:49.023 --> 00:41:53.784
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.

438
00:41:53.863 --> 00:41:55.863
<i>Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.</i>

439
00:41:56.183 --> 00:42:00.983
<i>His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.</i>

440
00:42:02.943 --> 00:42:05.903
<i>Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?</i>

441
00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:10.103
Sure, but the second Master
finds out you sent Dug out by himself,

442
00:42:10.183 --> 00:42:11.703
none of us will get a treat.

443
00:42:12.303 --> 00:42:14.783
<i>You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.</i>

444
00:42:16.503 --> 00:42:18.983
<i>This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.</i>

445
00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:21.782
<i>Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.</i>

446
00:42:21.863 --> 00:42:24.822
<i>I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?</i>

447
00:42:24.903 --> 00:42:27.542
<i>Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.</i>

448
00:42:27.623 --> 00:42:29.023
Yeah, right!

449
00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:32.662
<i>Impossible! Where are you?</i>

450
00:42:32.743 --> 00:42:34.103
<i>I am here with the bird,</i>

451
00:42:34.182 --> 00:42:36.823
<i>and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.</i>

452
00:42:36.902 --> 00:42:39.222
<i>- Gotta go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?</i>

453
00:42:39.303 --> 00:42:41.142
<i>- No, wait, wait!
- What's Dug doing?</i>

454
00:42:41.223 --> 00:42:42.982
Why's he with
that small mailman?

455
00:42:43.062 --> 00:42:44.622
Where are they?

456
00:42:46.942 --> 00:42:48.822
<i>There he is. Come on!</i>

457
00:42:53.262 --> 00:42:55.862
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

458
00:42:55.942 --> 00:42:57.302
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

459
00:42:57.382 --> 00:42:59.221
That man there says
I can take the bird,

460
00:43:00.582 --> 00:43:01.942
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

461
00:43:02.022 --> 00:43:03.061
I am not your master!

462
00:43:03.142 --> 00:43:04.622
I am warning you
once again, bird.

463
00:43:04.702 --> 00:43:06.622
- Hey! Quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird.

464
00:43:06.702 --> 00:43:08.902
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

465
00:43:08.981 --> 00:43:10.262
Here, bird.

466
00:43:17.901 --> 00:43:19.742
I am nobody's master, got it?

467
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:22.181
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

468
00:43:22.261 --> 00:43:23.501
I'm stuck with you!

469
00:43:23.582 --> 00:43:26.141
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

470
00:43:26.222 --> 00:43:28.662
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

471
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:32.021
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

472
00:43:32.662 --> 00:43:33.902
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

473
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:35.941
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

474
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:37.421
- Go get it!
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

475
00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:39.262
I will get it and then bring it back!

476
00:43:39.341 --> 00:43:40.821
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

477
00:43:40.902 --> 00:43:42.861
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

478
00:43:43.301 --> 00:43:44.621
Bird. Bird!

479
00:43:46.901 --> 00:43:48.621
Come on, Russell.

480
00:43:48.941 --> 00:43:51.221
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

481
00:43:56.221 --> 00:43:57.861
What are we doing?

482
00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.700
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

483
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:14.020
I think that did the trick.

484
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.140
Hi, Master.

485
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.220
Afternoon.

486
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.739
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

487
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.620
Which one's the front?

488
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.380
Oh, boy.

489
00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.020
Is this step three or step five?

490
00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.419
There.

491
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.459
All done! That's for you.

492
00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:11.579
Oh...

493
00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:13.099
Tents are hard.

494
00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:18.659
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

495
00:45:19.339 --> 00:45:23.259
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

496
00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:26.539
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

497
00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:30.419
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

498
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:33.019
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

499
00:45:33.098 --> 00:45:35.459
Well, never outside.

500
00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:39.219
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

501
00:45:39.659 --> 00:45:42.379
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

502
00:45:42.458 --> 00:45:44.979
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

503
00:45:45.058 --> 00:45:47.299
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

504
00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:48.939
He's gotta be home sometime.

505
00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:53.099
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

506
00:45:53.178 --> 00:45:56.458
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

507
00:45:56.898 --> 00:45:58.618
Phyllis isn't my mom.

508
00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:01.778
Oh.

509
00:46:08.658 --> 00:46:12.578
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony

510
00:46:12.658 --> 00:46:15.338
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.

511
00:46:16.578 --> 00:46:19.378
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

512
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:28.178
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

513
00:46:28.458 --> 00:46:31.937
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

514
00:46:33.898 --> 00:46:35.338
Mr. Fredricksen?

515
00:46:35.418 --> 00:46:38.178
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

516
00:46:39.018 --> 00:46:40.897
We have to protect him.

517
00:46:43.018 --> 00:46:44.977
Can Kevin go with us?

518
00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:48.378
All right, he can come.

519
00:46:49.017 --> 00:46:51.057
Promise you won't leave him?

520
00:46:51.537 --> 00:46:53.578
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

521
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:03.257
Cross my heart.

522
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:10.977
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

523
00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.896
Morning, sweetheart.

524
00:47:36.976 --> 00:47:38.496
We better get moving.

525
00:47:41.096 --> 00:47:42.376
Bird's gone.

526
00:47:42.456 --> 00:47:45.896
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

527
00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:50.976
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

528
00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:54.736
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

529
00:47:54.816 --> 00:47:56.616
Look. There he is!

530
00:47:58.936 --> 00:48:00.056
Point!

531
00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:03.936
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!

532
00:48:04.016 --> 00:48:05.216
Yeah, get off of his...

533
00:48:10.576 --> 00:48:11.616
What is it doing?

534
00:48:11.696 --> 00:48:14.016
The bird is calling to her babies.

535
00:48:15.095 --> 00:48:16.496
Her babies.

536
00:48:17.815 --> 00:48:19.296
Kevin's a girl?

537
00:48:21.575 --> 00:48:24.216
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

538
00:48:25.255 --> 00:48:28.695
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

539
00:48:29.895 --> 00:48:31.496
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

540
00:48:33.976 --> 00:48:36.375
But you promised to protect her.

541
00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:39.615
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

542
00:48:39.695 --> 00:48:42.615
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

543
00:48:44.015 --> 00:48:45.095
Yeah.

544
00:48:52.455 --> 00:48:55.055
This was her favorite chocolate.

545
00:48:55.654 --> 00:48:59.535
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

546
00:49:01.134 --> 00:49:02.134
Huh?

547
00:49:02.215 --> 00:49:03.334
Kevin?

548
00:49:21.254 --> 00:49:24.054
<i>Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.</i>

549
00:49:24.134 --> 00:49:25.294
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

550
00:49:25.374 --> 00:49:28.294
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

551
00:49:28.374 --> 00:49:31.334
<i>- Where is it?
- Uh... Tomorrow.</i>

552
00:49:31.414 --> 00:49:35.134
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

553
00:49:36.334 --> 00:49:39.854
<i>You lost it!
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?</i>

554
00:49:40.373 --> 00:49:43.494
<i>Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman</i>

555
00:49:43.574 --> 00:49:45.974
<i>and the one who smells of prunes.</i>

556
00:49:47.574 --> 00:49:49.973
<i>Master will be most pleased
we have found them</i>

557
00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:52.853
<i>and will ask of them many questions.
Come!</i>

558
00:49:52.934 --> 00:49:56.334
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

559
00:49:58.733 --> 00:49:59.814
Get away from me!

560
00:50:03.453 --> 00:50:04.734
Get down!

561
00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:57.892
Stay!

562
00:51:05.772 --> 00:51:08.252
You came here in that?

563
00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:09.932
Uh, yeah.

564
00:51:10.652 --> 00:51:14.332
In a house? A floating house?

565
00:51:22.492 --> 00:51:25.212
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

566
00:51:25.772 --> 00:51:28.212
You're not after my bird, are you?

567
00:51:28.612 --> 00:51:31.051
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

568
00:51:31.132 --> 00:51:33.292
I'd be happy to oblige.

569
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:39.011
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

570
00:51:39.451 --> 00:51:41.211
My dogs made a mistake.

571
00:51:41.771 --> 00:51:44.091
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

572
00:51:44.172 --> 00:51:46.691
Yeah, well, yes.

573
00:51:46.772 --> 00:51:48.811
THE Charles Muntz?

574
00:51:49.171 --> 00:51:51.011
"Adventure is out there!"

575
00:51:51.091 --> 00:51:54.491
It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!

576
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:58.011
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

577
00:51:58.091 --> 00:51:59.851
- Yes! Yes! That's him!
- I'm Carl Fredricksen.

578
00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:02.651
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

579
00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:04.411
Oh, well. You're a man of good taste.

580
00:52:06.651 --> 00:52:08.731
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

581
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:09.811
Uh-huh.

582
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:11.291
Now, attention, everyone!

583
00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:15.050
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

584
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:19.450
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

585
00:52:19.531 --> 00:52:21.171
You do smell like prunes.

586
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.251
Whoa!

587
00:52:23.811 --> 00:52:24.891
I will not bite you.

588
00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.330
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

589
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.610
I'm sorry about the dogs.

590
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:33.570
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
- We weren't.

591
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.971
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

592
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.810
<i>We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?</i>

593
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:46.890
Oh...

594
00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.650
Would you like to?

595
00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:49.930
Would I?

596
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.770
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

597
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.050
Jiminy Cricket.

598
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.330
- Not you.
- What do we do with Dug?

599
00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:02.010
<i>He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.</i>

600
00:53:06.769 --> 00:53:09.010
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

601
00:53:10.329 --> 00:53:14.410
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

602
00:53:14.489 --> 00:53:18.090
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

603
00:53:18.449 --> 00:53:21.169
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

604
00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:23.649
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

605
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.330
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

606
00:53:26.409 --> 00:53:29.049
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

607
00:53:29.129 --> 00:53:30.769
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

608
00:53:30.849 --> 00:53:33.169
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

609
00:53:33.249 --> 00:53:36.089
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

610
00:53:36.489 --> 00:53:39.729
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

611
00:53:39.809 --> 00:53:42.569
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

612
00:53:42.889 --> 00:53:44.849
That's an interesting story there.

613
00:53:45.249 --> 00:53:46.889
Excellent choice.

614
00:53:46.969 --> 00:53:50.609
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

615
00:53:50.689 --> 00:53:54.409
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

616
00:53:54.488 --> 00:53:56.249
and did he cheat!

617
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:58.488
Oh, he was horrible.

618
00:53:59.089 --> 00:54:01.608
<i>Master, dinner is ready.</i>

619
00:54:01.928 --> 00:54:03.968
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

620
00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:08.449
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

621
00:54:08.528 --> 00:54:09.848
Thank you, Master.

622
00:54:09.929 --> 00:54:12.048
I liked his other voice.

623
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:16.368
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

624
00:54:17.448 --> 00:54:20.488
So, how are things stateside, huh?

625
00:54:20.568 --> 00:54:22.888
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

626
00:54:23.888 --> 00:54:26.408
but I have unfinished work here.

627
00:54:26.488 --> 00:54:29.368
Please. I hope you're hungry,

628
00:54:29.448 --> 00:54:33.567
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

629
00:54:38.168 --> 00:54:41.048
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

630
00:54:41.127 --> 00:54:42.128
Yes!

631
00:54:43.607 --> 00:54:45.527
Hey! Hey!

632
00:54:45.927 --> 00:54:48.848
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

633
00:54:48.927 --> 00:54:51.287
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

634
00:54:51.368 --> 00:54:53.927
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

635
00:54:54.007 --> 00:54:56.448
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

636
00:54:56.527 --> 00:54:58.888
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

637
00:54:58.967 --> 00:55:02.847
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

638
00:55:02.927 --> 00:55:04.287
- Treat! Where's the treat!
- Treat!

639
00:55:05.447 --> 00:55:07.288
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

640
00:55:07.367 --> 00:55:08.727
- I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

641
00:55:08.807 --> 00:55:10.327
I shouldn't have used that word.

642
00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:13.047
Having guests is a delight.

643
00:55:13.127 --> 00:55:16.847
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

644
00:55:16.927 --> 00:55:17.927
No!

645
00:55:20.367 --> 00:55:22.727
They called me a fraud, those...

646
00:55:25.207 --> 00:55:28.966
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

647
00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:31.726
Beautiful, isn't it?

648
00:55:34.287 --> 00:55:36.847
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

649
00:55:38.726 --> 00:55:42.406
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

650
00:55:43.327 --> 00:55:47.727
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

651
00:55:48.526 --> 00:55:50.126
You can't go in after it.

652
00:55:50.607 --> 00:55:52.726
Once in, there's no way out.

653
00:55:53.326 --> 00:55:55.206
I've lost so many dogs.

654
00:55:57.766 --> 00:56:02.086
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

655
00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:07.566
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

656
00:56:10.206 --> 00:56:12.206
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

657
00:56:14.166 --> 00:56:16.886
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

658
00:56:16.965 --> 00:56:18.966
I trained it to follow us.

659
00:56:19.045 --> 00:56:22.126
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

660
00:56:22.566 --> 00:56:24.925
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

661
00:56:25.326 --> 00:56:28.765
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

662
00:56:28.846 --> 00:56:31.645
But it ran off. It's gone now.

663
00:56:38.206 --> 00:56:42.606
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

664
00:56:42.685 --> 00:56:45.165
they all tell pretty good stories.

665
00:56:47.765 --> 00:56:49.925
A surveyor making a map.

666
00:56:51.685 --> 00:56:53.885
A botanist cataloguing plants.

667
00:56:56.845 --> 00:57:02.285
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

668
00:57:08.565 --> 00:57:12.524
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

669
00:57:21.764 --> 00:57:25.245
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

670
00:57:25.324 --> 00:57:26.605
Oh, you're not leaving.

671
00:57:26.684 --> 00:57:30.165
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

672
00:57:30.244 --> 00:57:33.325
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

673
00:57:33.404 --> 00:57:36.204
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

674
00:57:36.524 --> 00:57:40.724
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

675
00:57:41.884 --> 00:57:44.844
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

676
00:57:45.484 --> 00:57:47.724
We have so much more to talk about.

677
00:57:51.884 --> 00:57:53.004
Kevin?

678
00:58:00.403 --> 00:58:01.724
It's here.

679
00:58:03.843 --> 00:58:04.803
Get them!

680
00:58:07.444 --> 00:58:09.764
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

681
00:58:09.843 --> 00:58:12.043
Ahhh! They're coming!

682
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:16.563
Master, over here.

683
00:58:31.403 --> 00:58:33.643
Go toward the light, Master!

684
00:59:01.322 --> 00:59:02.642
Russell!

685
00:59:06.922 --> 00:59:08.322
Get back!

686
00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:14.602
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

687
00:59:15.762 --> 00:59:17.322
Stop, you dogs.

688
00:59:27.762 --> 00:59:29.162
Whoa!

689
00:59:44.522 --> 00:59:45.601
Help!

690
00:59:46.121 --> 00:59:47.361
Help!

691
00:59:47.801 --> 00:59:48.962
Help!

692
00:59:50.442 --> 00:59:53.362
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

693
00:59:53.561 --> 00:59:55.241
Give me your hand!

694
01:00:06.122 --> 01:00:07.762
Hang on to Kevin!

695
01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:39.360
Kevin.

696
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.880
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

697
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.960
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

698
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.960
All right, but we gotta hurry.

699
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.759
You lost them?

700
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:32.959
No, it was Dug.

701
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.239
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

702
01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:38.559
Wait.

703
01:01:38.879 --> 01:01:41.359
Wait a minute. Dug.

704
01:01:47.679 --> 01:01:48.759
See anything?

705
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.159
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

706
01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:53.639
This is crazy.

707
01:01:53.719 --> 01:01:57.159
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

708
01:01:57.239 --> 01:01:58.559
Hey, I know a joke.

709
01:01:58.679 --> 01:02:00.479
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

710
01:02:00.599 --> 01:02:03.639
"I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead."

711
01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.919
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

712
01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.038
Careful, Russell.

713
01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.639
You okay, Kevin?

714
01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:20.678
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

715
01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:23.519
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

716
01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.159
Yeah? How so?

717
01:02:25.478 --> 01:02:27.639
It's kind of wild.

718
01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:31.238
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

719
01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:33.158
Get used to that, kid.

720
01:02:33.238 --> 01:02:35.558
My dad made it sound so easy.

721
01:02:35.638 --> 01:02:37.638
He's really good at camping

722
01:02:37.718 --> 01:02:40.678
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

723
01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:43.358
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

724
01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:47.158
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

725
01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:50.278
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickie.

726
01:02:50.358 --> 01:02:53.238
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

727
01:02:53.278 --> 01:02:56.958
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

728
01:02:57.078 --> 01:03:00.477
and whoever gets the most wins.

729
01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:04.798
I like that curb.

730
01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:09.598
That might sound boring,

731
01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:13.957
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

732
01:03:21.157 --> 01:03:22.918
Look! There it is!

733
01:03:23.637 --> 01:03:26.917
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

734
01:03:37.077 --> 01:03:40.517
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

735
01:03:41.757 --> 01:03:45.077
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

736
01:03:49.436 --> 01:03:51.196
Run, Kevin! Run!

737
01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:55.196
Oh, no!

738
01:04:00.197 --> 01:04:02.356
Russell, give me your knife!

739
01:04:04.276 --> 01:04:06.196
Get away from my bird!

740
01:04:31.396 --> 01:04:32.475
No!

741
01:04:38.836 --> 01:04:40.116
No!

742
01:04:46.195 --> 01:04:48.955
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

743
01:04:50.676 --> 01:04:53.475
Let her go! Stop!

744
01:04:57.155 --> 01:04:58.995
Kevin!

745
01:05:12.155 --> 01:05:13.874
You gave away Kevin.

746
01:05:16.595 --> 01:05:19.315
You just gave her away.

747
01:05:21.075 --> 01:05:26.435
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

748
01:05:28.994 --> 01:05:31.635
Master, it's alright.

749
01:05:32.434 --> 01:05:34.234
I am not your master!

750
01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:37.914
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

751
01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.195
Bad dog! Bad dog!

752
01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.195
Now, whether you assist me or not,

753
01:05:50.674 --> 01:05:54.114
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

754
01:07:03.312 --> 01:07:06.993
Here. I don't want this anymore.

755
01:10:38.508 --> 01:10:39.628
Russell?

756
01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:45.428
Russell!

757
01:10:45.548 --> 01:10:48.908
I'm gonna help Kevin, even if you won't!

758
01:10:50.188 --> 01:10:52.108
No, Russell! No!

759
01:12:00.786 --> 01:12:01.827
Huh?

760
01:12:01.866 --> 01:12:02.986
Russell?

761
01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:06.146
Dug!

762
01:12:06.347 --> 01:12:10.826
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

763
01:12:10.867 --> 01:12:13.227
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

764
01:12:13.266 --> 01:12:14.546
And I'm your master.

765
01:12:14.666 --> 01:12:16.107
You're my master?

766
01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:17.426
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

767
01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:20.186
Good boy, Dug!
You're a good boy!

768
01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.025
Yes!

769
01:12:47.945 --> 01:12:49.706
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

770
01:12:58.306 --> 01:13:03.146
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

771
01:13:03.185 --> 01:13:04.386
Master?

772
01:13:04.786 --> 01:13:07.785
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

773
01:13:08.265 --> 01:13:09.705
Let me go.

774
01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.505
Where's your elderly friend?

775
01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:17.265
He's not my friend anymore.

776
01:13:17.745 --> 01:13:21.065
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

777
01:13:22.025 --> 01:13:24.105
Where are you
keeping Kevin?

778
01:13:25.225 --> 01:13:26.385
Let me go!

779
01:13:26.505 --> 01:13:28.585
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

780
01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.985
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

781
01:13:31.625 --> 01:13:34.984
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

782
01:13:38.704 --> 01:13:40.265
Alpha,
Fredricksen's coming back.

783
01:13:40.385 --> 01:13:43.825
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

784
01:13:43.944 --> 01:13:47.145
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

785
01:13:47.184 --> 01:13:49.024
Nice talking with you.

786
01:13:52.105 --> 01:13:53.104
Ahhh!

787
01:13:53.704 --> 01:13:55.785
Where are you, Fredricksen?

788
01:14:13.544 --> 01:14:14.824
Russell!

789
01:14:26.864 --> 01:14:29.384
- Mr. Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

790
01:14:31.184 --> 01:14:33.583
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

791
01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:35.783
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

792
01:14:35.903 --> 01:14:37.064
But I wanna help.

793
01:14:37.103 --> 01:14:38.343
I don't want your help.

794
01:14:38.464 --> 01:14:40.104
I want you safe.

795
01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.223
How do we get past these dogs?

796
01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:50.863
Point!

797
01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:02.023
Kevin.

798
01:15:03.183 --> 01:15:05.543
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

799
01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:09.023
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

800
01:15:09.543 --> 01:15:11.983
Guard well that bird, my minions.

801
01:15:12.863 --> 01:15:14.223
What do we do now, Dug?

802
01:15:26.983 --> 01:15:28.742
Who wants the ball?

803
01:15:29.902 --> 01:15:31.622
- Me! I want it!
- Me! I do!

804
01:15:31.943 --> 01:15:33.262
- I want the ball!
- Give it to me!

805
01:15:33.382 --> 01:15:34.622
Then go get it!

806
01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.942
I'm gonna get there first!

807
01:15:37.062 --> 01:15:38.383
Getting the ball!

808
01:15:38.502 --> 01:15:39.903
I got it!

809
01:15:40.262 --> 01:15:41.222
Uh-oh.

810
01:15:44.902 --> 01:15:47.742
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

811
01:15:47.782 --> 01:15:49.702
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

812
01:15:49.822 --> 01:15:50.822
He's here!

813
01:15:50.862 --> 01:15:52.902
- He's got the bird!
- The bird's gone...

814
01:15:53.022 --> 01:15:54.942
Calm down! One at a time!

815
01:15:58.301 --> 01:16:00.942
I... want... to... help!

816
01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:02.021
Ha-ha!

817
01:16:11.142 --> 01:16:12.581
- He's in Hall D!
- He's in Hall C!

818
01:16:12.622 --> 01:16:14.022
It's the old man!

819
01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:17.342
Does anyone know where they are?

820
01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:34.381
Gray Leader? Take down the house.

821
01:16:40.861 --> 01:16:42.101
Gray Leader, checking in.

822
01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.140
Gray Two, checking in.

823
01:16:43.261 --> 01:16:44.381
Gray Three, checking in.

824
01:16:48.701 --> 01:16:49.981
Target sighted.

825
01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.581
Come on, Kevin.

826
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:07.580
Auuggghh!

827
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.140
Hi.

828
01:17:40.339 --> 01:17:43.540
Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on!
Spit it out!

829
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.300
- Come on.
- Enough!

830
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.140
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

831
01:18:19.379 --> 01:18:20.979
Come on, Kevin.

832
01:18:39.419 --> 01:18:42.259
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

833
01:18:50.298 --> 01:18:51.739
He wears the Cone of Shame!

834
01:18:52.258 --> 01:18:55.538
<i>What?
Do not just continue sitting. Attack!</i>

835
01:18:58.498 --> 01:19:01.658
<i>No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!</i>

836
01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:03.538
Listen, you dog. Sit!

837
01:19:05.058 --> 01:19:06.258
Yes, Alpha.

838
01:19:06.338 --> 01:19:08.858
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

839
01:19:09.218 --> 01:19:10.218
Oh!

840
01:19:11.778 --> 01:19:13.418
I can't do it.

841
01:19:15.658 --> 01:19:16.858
- Russell!
- Huh?

842
01:19:17.017 --> 01:19:20.297
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

843
01:19:21.178 --> 01:19:23.578
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

844
01:19:39.618 --> 01:19:41.417
Hey, squirrel!

845
01:19:41.497 --> 01:19:43.417
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

846
01:19:43.497 --> 01:19:44.777
Where's the squirrel?

847
01:19:48.457 --> 01:19:50.057
I hate squirrels.

848
01:20:09.897 --> 01:20:10.936
Dug!

849
01:20:11.417 --> 01:20:12.576
Master!

850
01:20:13.577 --> 01:20:16.777
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

851
01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:23.176
Mr. Fredricksen!

852
01:20:23.737 --> 01:20:25.297
Go on, Kevin!

853
01:20:39.616 --> 01:20:40.696
No!

854
01:20:54.935 --> 01:20:57.176
Russell! Get out of there!

855
01:20:59.096 --> 01:21:01.136
No! Leave them alone!

856
01:21:15.815 --> 01:21:19.815
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

857
01:21:21.815 --> 01:21:23.815
Kevin! Chocolate!

858
01:21:45.414 --> 01:21:46.975
That was cool!

859
01:21:48.935 --> 01:21:53.135
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

860
01:21:55.335 --> 01:21:57.734
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

861
01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:22.694
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

862
01:22:25.214 --> 01:22:27.894
You know, it's just a house.

863
01:22:35.614 --> 01:22:37.694
Look at you. You're so soft.

864
01:22:40.174 --> 01:22:41.694
Aw!

865
01:22:41.773 --> 01:22:43.494
I wish I could keep one.

866
01:22:47.693 --> 01:22:49.654
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

867
01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:00.773
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

868
01:23:01.614 --> 01:23:03.093
Bye, Kevin!

869
01:23:12.133 --> 01:23:13.373
Ready?

870
01:23:13.733 --> 01:23:15.013
Ready.

871
01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.012
<i>And by receiving
their badges,</i>

872
01:23:27.093 --> 01:23:31.572
<i>the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.</i>

873
01:23:31.933 --> 01:23:35.613
<i>For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.</i>

874
01:23:35.853 --> 01:23:40.133
<i>For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.</i>

875
01:23:40.612 --> 01:23:42.692
<i>For Assisting the Elderly...</i>

876
01:23:43.492 --> 01:23:46.532
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

877
01:23:49.172 --> 01:23:52.132
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

878
01:23:54.852 --> 01:23:56.292
I'm here for him.

879
01:23:56.493 --> 01:23:58.652
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

880
01:24:01.692 --> 01:24:04.652
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

881
01:24:05.092 --> 01:24:09.132
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

882
01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:14.172
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

883
01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:18.132
The Ellie badge.

884
01:24:21.012 --> 01:24:22.051
Wow.

885
01:24:26.571 --> 01:24:28.972
<i>All right,
I think that covers everybody.</i>

886
01:24:29.051 --> 01:24:31.012
<i>So let's give a big Explorer call</i>

887
01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:34.651
<i>to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.</i>

888
01:24:34.892 --> 01:24:35.972
<i>Ready, everybody?</i>

889
01:24:36.051 --> 01:24:37.531
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

890
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:45.931
- Blue one.
- Red one.

891
01:24:46.571 --> 01:24:48.291
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

892
01:24:49.211 --> 01:24:51.131
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

893
01:24:51.531 --> 01:24:53.131
It's red, isn't it?

894
01:24:53.211 --> 01:24:55.011
Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

895
01:24:55.211 --> 01:24:56.931
No, I'm not. Red one.

896
01:24:57.011 --> 01:24:58.731
That's a fire hydrant.

897
01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:02.731
Maybe I need new glasses.
