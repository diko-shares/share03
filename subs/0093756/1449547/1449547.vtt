1
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.815
Take it, brother.

2
00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:57.823
Let me break you.

3
00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:03.913
Man, that was funky. Heh.

4
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.172
Hmm?

5
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.551
Whoa! Ah.

6
00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:08.970
- Fore!
- Well, heh, I guess the meeting's started.

7
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:14.317
- Howdy, sir?
- Mahoney, heh! Jones, heh!

8
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.686
Thank you, Sweetchuck.

9
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.861
I've had the most wonderful news
about my new program, heh.

10
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:29.912
- What new program is that, sir?
- My citizens on patrol.

11
00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.743
I call it C.O.P. for short.

12
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.082
Has a nice "police-y" ring to it,
don't you think?

13
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.458
What is C.O.P., sir?

14
00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.385
What is the most frustrating thing
about police work?

15
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.180
- Not being able to carry hand grenades.
- Separate locker rooms, sir.

16
00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.054
Icky blue uniforms.

17
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.098
I always thought
that the most frustrating thing was that...

18
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.147
...we couldn't be everywhere at once
to solve every crime.

19
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.396
So the public ends up
thinking of us as enemies.

20
00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.192
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could all be friends?

21
00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.779
Ah, officer Mahoney, please come in.

22
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.028
Have some lemonade. I love lemonade.

23
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:11.832
- Not too tart, not--
- Too sweet, just, mm, mm, good.

24
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.590
So C.O.P. is
a community action program, sir.

25
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:24.091
- Like Neighborhood Watch?
- More. Much more!

26
00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.806
We show the community that we care.

27
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:31.637
We train volunteers in crime detection,
in first-aid and...

28
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.724
- And it's a great idea, sir.
- But we need citizen support.

29
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.026
With all this neighborhood crime,
I'm sure you'll get it.

30
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.103
- Fore!
- Right. What if we were to...

31
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.195
- What was that?
- Unh...

32
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.444
I believe brother Sweetchuck
is suggesting...

33
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.619
...we recruit in our old neighborhood.

34
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.824
Excellent. We have the full support
of the mayor...

35
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.083
...and best of all, the governor of the state
wants me to unveil the program...

36
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.711
...at the end of
the International Police Seminar...

37
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.417
...next month in England.

38
00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.048
While I attend the seminar...

39
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.176
...you, my good friends...

40
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.428
...will put C.O.P. into action.

41
00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.266
We'll change community relations
all around the world.

42
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.936
The Lassard Method.

43
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.477
It rolls nicely off the tongue,
don't you think?

44
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.984
Hi! What did I miss?

45
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.121
Hi.

46
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.664
<i>Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread</i>

47
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.758
Uh, Capt. Harris,
Police Commissioner Hurst is here.

48
00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.089
You want to see him?

49
00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.969
No. Send him packing.

50
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.434
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.058
- Proctor!
- Yes, sir?

52
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.765
Send the Commissioner in immediately.

53
00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.148
- I thought you said to send him packing.
- Immediately!

54
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.569
Yes, sir.

55
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.405
Nincompoop.

56
00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.650
Commissioner.

57
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.072
- You have a problem, Capt. Harris?
- Uh, yes, sir.

58
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:18.911
Commissioner, I am extremely concerned
with this memorandum from Lassard...

59
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.872
...about his C.O.P. program.

60
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.505
Citizens doing police work?
An asinine idea.

61
00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:31.598
If this goes through, no policeman's job,
no policeman's paycheck, will be safe.

62
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.219
Are you through, captain?

63
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:38.055
The governor of this state thinks
that this program is absolutely brilliant.

64
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:42.983
So until he changes his mind,
that's what you and I think too.

65
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.568
Agreed?

66
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.487
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

67
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.239
You were right.
You should have sent him packing.

68
00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.580
I don't give a damn
what the governor or the mayor thinks.

69
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:03.083
Lassard's program is a mistake...

70
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.875
...and anyone who thinks otherwise
is wrong.

71
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.169
Pure and simple.

72
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.880
Don't touch those!

73
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.392
Don't you ever touch my balls
without asking!

74
00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.491
You're gonna have to leave.
I'll call the police. I mean it.

75
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.915
Okay, I'm going. I'm out of here.

76
00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.582
Wait a minute. I am the police.

77
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.799
- No, you're not.
- That's me. I'm here to speak about C.O.P.

78
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.471
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Without the uniform on--

79
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.142
Regular human clothes
make people more comfortable.

80
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:04.107
Hi, ladies. Let's do some poetry!

81
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.363
I got to go to my in-laws'
for dinner tonight.

82
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.653
You want to come?

83
00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:22.792
Officer Hightower,
I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program.

84
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.250
Do I know you?

85
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:26.545
Yeah, you used to bounce me on your knee.

86
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.998
- I did?
- Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin.

87
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:33.302
- But now they call me House.
- Tommy Conklin. Tommy Conklin.

88
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:38.266
Sure. Welcome aboard.
You can register right over there.

89
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:55.779
<i>Blind mouth that scare themselves</i>

90
00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:59.532
<i>Know how to hold a sheep hook</i>

91
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.411
<i>Or have learned aught else at least</i>

92
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:08.663
<i>That to the faithful herdsmans' art belongs</i>

93
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.883
Whoa! Ah, that was exciting.

94
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.263
We have an, uh, Officer Zed,
who's here to tell us...

95
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.725
...a little bit about my new police program.
So won't you...

96
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.022
Thank you very much.

97
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:40.570
Oof. I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional, sensitive guy...

98
00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:46.038
...and that part about the sheep hook
just tore my heart right out. Um...

99
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.916
I have my own poem
that I prepared for you today.

100
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.881
<i>Gene, Gene made a machine</i>

101
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.630
<i>And Joe, Joe made it go</i>

102
00:09:55.845 --> 00:10:01.307
<i>I blew a fart
and blew the whole damn thing apart</i>

103
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.431
What is he saying?

104
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.393
I didn't write it.

105
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.443
Ahem, okay, I'd like to talk to you
about what we're here for...

106
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.647
...and that's for me to pitch
the new C.O.P. program to you.

107
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.403
Perhaps a few of you ladies
might be interested in it.

108
00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:23.529
So the bartender asked the organ grinder,

109
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.614
"Hey, does your monkey sing any
opera?"

110
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.746
And I said, "Nope.

111
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.578
But if you hit me on the head,
I'll sing <i>Yankee Doodle."</i>

112
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:41.093
Ooh, it's so nice to have my family
all back together again.

113
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:48.520
- Can you pass the lettuce, Pop?
- Oh, sure, honey. Here you go.

114
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.848
- Thanks, Pop.
- You're welcome. Hey, listen...

115
00:10:51.025 --> 00:10:53.859
...did I tell you I'm gonna join
that Citizen On Patrol thing?

116
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.529
That would be a great idea.
I'd be proud to have you at the precinct.

117
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.857
- Ah.
- I'll take some more greens, Bud.

118
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.362
- Dad.
- Yeah?

119
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:05.450
I don't think you should sign up.
There are already three of us on the force.

120
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.908
- It's going to look like favoritism.
- That's not it.

121
00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.708
That's not it at all. You just don't think
I'm fast enough anymore, do you?

122
00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:20.044
- I don't think that's it, do you, Tack?
- Ahem, mm.

123
00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.596
It has nothing to do with being fast.

124
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.345
- Ah.
- Now, that was fast, huh?

125
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.428
Ahem. You know, that was fast.

126
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.556
But that's hard.

127
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.481
- Ooh, oh, oh.
- Excuse me. Ha-ha.

128
00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.489
I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings.

129
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.454
Oh, you two.

130
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.579
Ow, ow, ow.

131
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.875
Oh, well, who wants pie?

132
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.717
Mm.

133
00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.550
- I was just trying to help.
- You hurt my arm.

134
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.102
- I'll hand the rest out. Hi.
- Hi.

135
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.431
Could I interest you
in the new citizens program?

136
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.562
- Ah, heh, no, I don't think so.
- No, thanks.

137
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.897
- We'll take the stairs.
- Thanks, just the same.

138
00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.855
Excuse me!

139
00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:24.696
Would you be interested
in the new citizens program?

140
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.364
- Ah, yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right.
- Sure, here.

141
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.785
- Why don't you hand the rest of them out?
- Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.

142
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.010
- Arnie, where are you going?
- Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do.

143
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.134
I got a term paper due tomorrow,
and a history test.

144
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:50.559
I got to help my father clean the cellar,
and I have to do the dishes tonight.

145
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:51.806
- Tsk.
- What are you doing?

146
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:55.139
- I'll get the guys and hang out at the mall.
- Let's go.

147
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.151
Hey, Artie, Kyle.

148
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:03.656
I thought I told you guys,
no skateboarding in my district.

149
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:07.780
This isn't skateboarding, sergeant.
This is carrying skateboards.

150
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:13.414
This is skateboarding.

151
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.663
- We got to check this out, you guys.
- Take it easy.

152
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.210
We'll see you later.

153
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.926
I'll see you later.
I want to check out these guys.

154
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.676
All right, I'll be back.

155
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.994
Hey, sarge, look at that.

156
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:18.699
- Hm, Kyle, that skateboard punk.
- Let's nail him.

157
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.251
Boy, you sure give them a hard time.

158
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.829
Yeah. Fun, isn't it?

159
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.505
You don't listen, do you, Kyle?

160
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:35.136
I was shopping
for Capt. Harris' birthday present.

161
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.808
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.430
Shop somewhere else.

163
00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.681
Oh, Your Honor, uh...

164
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.194
Here, judge. Stop him! Hold up!

165
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.239
Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, my fault.

166
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:55.195
- Watch it!
- Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it!

167
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.573
I can do that, that handstand stuff.

168
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.869
I just hate it
when the change falls out of my pocket.

169
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.757
Hey, man,
I think these guys want to talk to you.

170
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.337
Hold it!

171
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.845
Capt. Harris will hear about this!

172
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.164
Come.

173
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.162
- Sir.
- Copeland, what the hell happened to you?

174
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.793
Some skateboard punks
started a riot at the mall.

175
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.419
Bring them in here.

176
00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.002
- They got away.
- They got away?

177
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:57.306
- I did the best I could, sir.
- It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland?

178
00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:01.386
- No, sir.
- I'll handle these punks personally.

179
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.349
- Yes, sir.
- I want three patrol cars...

180
00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:05.640
...dissecting the neighborhood.
Copeland, my hat!

181
00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:08.103
- Yes, sir.
- You, radio-alert all motorcycle units.

182
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:10.985
I want a chopper in the air.
Spot these boys on the ground.

183
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.145
Proctor, ride with me.

184
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:16.658
- Now, Proctor, move it!
- Ah, coming, sir.

185
00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:22.326
Be right there!

186
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.290
There they go!

187
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:33.504
Back it up. Shh. Quiet!

188
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:38.305
I said quiet, dickhead.

189
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.554
We've got them now.

190
00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.648
I know they came in here.

191
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.340
Unit 6 to Capt. Harris.
We've got them at the end of the alley.

192
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.008
I got you now!

193
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.962
<i>You hold them
right there. We're coming.</i>

194
00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.141
<i>Copeland, have you got them?</i>

195
00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.184
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

196
00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:27.388
I'm Carey Mahoney of the Police Academy.

197
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.609
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please. Thank you. You're too kind.

198
00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.693
Jones.

199
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:42.824
It's Harris. Haul ass. Go.

200
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.747
I got you, you little punks.

201
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.958
Freeze, you little hoodlums.
Get your hands off my ass, Proctor.

202
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.920
Get away, Proctor.

203
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.182
Proctor.

204
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:15.731
No. Don't shake the fence.

205
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:25.161
Oh, shit. No!

206
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.708
The purpose of this program...

207
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.880
is to develop a better working relationship
between us, the police...

208
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.917
When he says, "Okay, boys and girls,"
we're all gonna...

209
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.754
...and you, the community.

210
00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:50.141
Stop! Stop right there!

211
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:55.400
You see, the great thing is, this is a first.

212
00:19:55.611 --> 00:20:00.151
The Police Academy has offered to train
you citizens to better protect yourselves.

213
00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.404
- You'll be trendsetters.
- Do we get to pack heat?

214
00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.155
Uh, heat--

215
00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:13.498
Stop those little punks! Stop them!

216
00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.502
You're under arrest!

217
00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:23.340
Are you all right?

218
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.218
Who's laughing now, you little twits?

219
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:30.018
And your clothes make me want to puke.
I'll tell you that right now.

220
00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:34.143
- Capt. Harris!
- Well, well, Mahoney.

221
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.226
- It's been a long time, sir.
- Hm. So it has.

222
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.357
Well, Motormouth Jones.

223
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.027
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a great tailor, sir?

224
00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.279
I mentioned that just last week.

225
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:50.114
Has anyone told you, Mahoney,
that you're still a little pissant?

226
00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.621
- No one whose opinion matters, sir.
- What did Arnie and Kyle do?

227
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:57.705
Ooh, you know those clowns?
Heh, I should have figured.

228
00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:02.589
Your little pals wrecked a police car,
destroyed a shopping mall...

229
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.136
...harassed citizens, resisted arrest.

230
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:07.384
Go easy, captain. They're just wacky kids.

231
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.934
Heh, we'll see how those wacky kids
like it in jail.

232
00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:17.854
In all my years on the bench,
I have seen all sorts of public disorder.

233
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.276
Young people must learn to conform...

234
00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:23.481
...to the standards and laws
of civilized society.

235
00:21:23.908 --> 00:21:27.151
In reviewing the testimony
and taking into account...

236
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:30.737
...your disregard
for public and private property...

237
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.453
...I can reach only one decision:

238
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.456
Guilty as hell.

239
00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:42.295
You flushed me down the toilet!

240
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:45.002
Before you pass sentence--

241
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.339
They're gonna send me to jail,
and some fat, hairy guy is gonna--

242
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.470
- May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
- Yes, sergeant.

243
00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:56.555
Ah, sir, do we want to expose these boys,
these children to a prison environment?

244
00:21:56.774 --> 00:22:00.188
- Yes.
- May I run my own court, captain?

245
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.564
- You've got a better idea?
- Yes, I do, sir.

246
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.898
Comdt. Lassard has initiated
a new community relations program.

247
00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.153
Why not assign these kids...

248
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.740
...to that program
as a form of alternate sentencing?

249
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.789
- That's ridiculous!
- I'll be the judge of that.

250
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.575
I... Excuse me.

251
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:20.249
I like the sound of this
community relations gig.

252
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:24.045
Milt Butterworth,
defender of the common man.

253
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.753
Your Honor, look at this list of complaints.

254
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.680
And I quote you directly, sir, when I say--

255
00:22:43.153 --> 00:22:46.942
Gee, sir, I thought you only got
contempt of court for opening your mouth.

256
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.947
Mahoney, I'm warning you.

257
00:22:52.162 --> 00:22:55.326
You keep Lassard's C.O.Ps
out of my precinct.

258
00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.456
You don't understand what I'm trying to do.

259
00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:59.743
I understand
exactly what you're trying to do.

260
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.288
Just keep them out,
especially these two little buttwads.

261
00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:05.999
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not planning to attack us...

262
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.881
...with any more of your bodily functions,
are you?

263
00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:15.767
You just make sure
that we never meet again. Ever.

264
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:21.018
You know, with those two idiots
in Lassard's program, it'll never work.

265
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.796
Excuse me, sir.

266
00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:52.174
We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman.

267
00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:54.221
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

268
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:05.187
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know a Mrs. Lois--

269
00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:08.270
- Where can we find Lois Feldman, please?
- There.

270
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.405
Thank you.

271
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.280
Mrs. Feldman?

272
00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:20.286
- Who's asking?
- Police.

273
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:23.410
Is it about those damn library books?

274
00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:28.832
We're following up on your alleged
interest in the Citizens On Patrol program.

275
00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:32.215
Ooh, then I'm Mrs. Feldman. Come on in.

276
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.928
Callahan, cover your rear.

277
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.687
I admire your taste.

278
00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:54.946
Yes, well, I do all my own decorating.

279
00:24:56.245 --> 00:24:58.077
You have a talent for it, ma'am.

280
00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:00.450
I'll be with you in a moment, sarge.

281
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:03.951
Uh, perhaps you'd like to discuss
the program first, ma'am.

282
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.580
What's to discuss?

283
00:25:05.796 --> 00:25:09.255
Think I want to hang out here
and listen to arteries hardening, heh?

284
00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.875
Where did I put that bulletproof vest?

285
00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:29.317
All right, fall in! Come on, please, line up.

286
00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:31.394
Come on, I need a lineup here.

287
00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:34.189
Hello, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen--

288
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:41.992
- Thank you, Miss...
- Mrs. Feldman.

289
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:44.286
Mrs. Feldman.

290
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.138
I want to welcome all of you
to the Academy.

291
00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:11.021
You are part of a new
and exciting program that I call...

292
00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:14.355
- ...I call C.O.P.
- C.O.P.

293
00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:19.071
- Citizens On Patrol.
- Citizens On Patrol.

294
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:22.196
- Citizens On Patrol!
- Citizens On Patrol!

295
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.245
You will work and train with the police.

296
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.747
The police will work and train with you.

297
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:32.835
Working and training,
training and working.

298
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.541
Excuse me, commandant.

299
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.094
But do you expect the community
to do the job of the police force?

300
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:42.470
There are many, many jobs
for many, many people.

301
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.177
Sir, I'll take care of this.

302
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.309
Excuse me, young lady,
what the commandant means...

303
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:50.937
...is that this program
will promote understanding...

304
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.102
...between the community and the police...

305
00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:56.646
...and make the community
more active in crime prevention.

306
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:59.153
Active in crime prevention?

307
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:04.112
- Won't that be dangerous?
- No. We just want to teach citizens...

308
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.448
...to prevent crimes from taking place.

309
00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:10.911
It sounds fine in theory.
Let's hope it works in practice.

310
00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:16.632
I like him. He's a really nice fish.

311
00:27:18.095 --> 00:27:19.506
He looks a little like you.

312
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:25.846
I will attend
an international police seminar in London.

313
00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:29.600
It would be
the crowning achievement of my career...

314
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:31.939
...if I could close this seminar...

315
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:35.235
...by bringing instructors
from all around the world...

316
00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:39.780
...here to watch
the C.O.P. program in action.

317
00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:45.157
I'm counting on all of you
to make that possible.

318
00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:47.614
In Comdt. Lassard's absence...

319
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:51.292
...I've appointed a very able-bodied
and experienced officer...

320
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:52.835
...to run the Academy.

321
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:56.373
Ah. Perfect timing. Here he is now.

322
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.296
Attention!

323
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.141
Two weeks of Harris? Damn!

324
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:22.274
Damn.

325
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.072
- Uh, uh...
- Deodorant? Thanks.

326
00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.663
Straighten this mess up.

327
00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.415
- What mess?
- Now!

328
00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:39.082
I want all of you dirtbags
and that group of C.O.P. people...

329
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:42.044
...out in front of this dormitory
at 1400 hours.

330
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.261
Move it!

331
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:47.682
Sir, we were just commenting
on how you'd mellowed.

332
00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:53.100
- Captain?
- What is it, Mahoney?

333
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:55.640
I hope you're gonna
give this program a fair chance.

334
00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:00.149
This program, Mahoney,
is just like you: a bad idea.

335
00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:01.946
That's your opinion, sir.

336
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:05.195
But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea,
and his Academy.

337
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.326
Ooh.

338
00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:09.654
Things can change, Mahoney.

339
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:13.037
Oh, yes, things can change.

340
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.334
I'll see you out front.

341
00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.720
I bet that was refreshing, sir.

342
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:38.141
Over the next two weeks...

343
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.694
...you'll go through
a modified training program.

344
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:45.398
You'll learn many, many keys
to crime prevention.

345
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:50.119
Keys you can teach many, many others
in your community.

346
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.244
Modified? Modified nothing.
I want the works.

347
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.166
- Yeah.
- Madam...

348
00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:59.416
...I think it's time for a dose of reality.

349
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:02.423
You can forget Lassard's hype.

350
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:07.588
You people do not belong here.

351
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:11.807
Especially you and you.

352
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:19.933
Community action groups mean one thing,
and one thing only.

353
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.858
I hope that wasn't gum.

354
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.447
You heard the captain. Is it?

355
00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:35.369
It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum.
Cherry, I think.

356
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:38.626
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

357
00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:45.383
These groups only mean
citizens getting in the way of the police.

358
00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:47.881
Now, I don't get involved
in your business...

359
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:50.759
...and I don't want you involved in my--

360
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.136
Now, if you were smart...

361
00:30:56.355 --> 00:31:00.190
...you would go home
and forget this stupid idea...

362
00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:04.814
Are those wedding bells I hear, sir?

363
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:13.612
- Whose damn mutt is this?
- It's my damn mutt.

364
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:17.539
I want him out of here!

365
00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:19.959
- But, sir--
- Out!

366
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.248
Out!

367
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:27.292
I am not getting rid of Clarence.
He's my pet.

368
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:31.175
Why should you?
After all, Harris has Proctor.

369
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:33.298
I'll take him.

370
00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.967
I have a big house, nice yard.

371
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:39.429
See, he likes me. We'll get along fine.

372
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:42.732
- Me too? I'm housebroken.
- Heh.

373
00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:45.606
Come on, C.O.Ps,
let's step up to the white line!

374
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:49.155
Let's line ourselves up with a slot,
then let's listen to Mr. Jones.

375
00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:51.358
Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry.

376
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.329
This is a standard police issue.38.

377
00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:58.663
Examine this weapon carefully.

378
00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.958
You must be sure this weapon is not loaded.

379
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:05.334
You will be responsible for the loading
and unloading of this weapon yourself.

380
00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:07.752
Now, Sgt. Tackleberry.

381
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.133
You want to become one with the gun.

382
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:19.060
Feel the gun, caress the gun...

383
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:24.398
...until it's a living,
breathing, vibrating...

384
00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:27.727
...extension of yourself.

385
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.528
I look for the same in a woman.

386
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.731
This sucker's not loaded.

387
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.862
You won't be using live ammo.

388
00:32:34.536 --> 00:32:38.951
Tack, how about letting me squeeze off
a few rounds of that baby?

389
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:40.532
Tack?

390
00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:43.284
Affirmative, Mrs. F.

391
00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:48.586
Now, be careful
because a.44 magnum has quite a...

392
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:52.294
...kick.

393
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.253
Damn, that was fun!

394
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.018
Rescuing the drowning victim.

395
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:03.846
Now, when approaching
a potentially dangerous...

396
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:06.357
...and out-of-control victim,
use this stroke only.

397
00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:08.355
Arms out of the way for protection.

398
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.189
Now, when you get the victim in control,
you slip your arm across his chest...

399
00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.739
...under his opposite arm.

400
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.363
Rest his head and his neck
against your shoulder.

401
00:33:16.578 --> 00:33:20.117
Kick with your feet.
Now, your victim could be struggling.

402
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:23.617
Struggle, House. Good, House...

403
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.950
House!

404
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:36.254
Really swift! I'll get him!

405
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.808
Arnie, get out of the pool! You just ate!

406
00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:03.489
Get him out of here!

407
00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:08.703
Thanks, pal.

408
00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:13.757
Now we have an opportunity
to start our water safety lesson.

409
00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.880
I will play the drowning victim.

410
00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:23.888
Arnie?

411
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.900
Now, who's going to save me?

412
00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:37.778
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

413
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:12.308
That was, uh, mighty brave.
I admire that.

414
00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:14.313
That was nothing.

415
00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:18.865
You don't have a hair dryer,
or, ah! Perhaps some mousse?

416
00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:23.286
No. Your hair looks nice. It's very stylish.

417
00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:25.704
<i>Moi?</i> Stylish?

418
00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.416
Oh, um, I think I'd better be going.

419
00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:31.414
Mickey!

420
00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:35.540
He's dead! He killed him!

421
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:39.844
- Oh, I'm sure the Academy will pay for it.
- What about the sentimental value?

422
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.921
This is a family heirloom here.

423
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.554
This is the last thing I ever stole
before joining the Academy.

424
00:35:45.769 --> 00:35:49.513
What the hell is this? Cadets in heat?

425
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:51.347
No. We were just, like, talking.

426
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:54.274
Oh, just, like, talk somewhere else.

427
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:57.649
This is not a spawning pool.
I want discipline.

428
00:35:58.031 --> 00:36:00.148
Do I make myself clear, Zed?

429
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:02.108
Discipline!

430
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.361
- Jerk.
- What?

431
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.946
He said bye.

432
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:13.540
No. I said jerk. I think it was pretty clear.

433
00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:15.417
- I said, "Jerk."
- Jerk.

434
00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:20.460
<i>"Wait," said the daisy, sweet buttercup</i>

435
00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:23.049
<i>Time to get up</i>

436
00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:26.970
<i>Time to get up</i>

437
00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:32.271
<i>As a daisy, sweet buttercup</i>

438
00:36:32.607 --> 00:36:36.476
<i>Time to get up, time to get up</i>

439
00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:54.828
Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you...

440
00:36:55.004 --> 00:36:57.337
...something that will be
vital for you to know...

441
00:36:57.507 --> 00:37:01.046
...when you're, like, out there on the job
as a police officer.

442
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:04.174
And that's the correct way
to eat a doughnut.

443
00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.135
- A doughnut--
- Attention!

444
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.551
Captain Harris.

445
00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:23.194
From this moment on, anyone
who misplaces their canister of Mace...

446
00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.445
...will be reprimanded and fined.

447
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.902
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

448
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.044
Bye.

449
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:43.171
As Citizens On Patrol...

450
00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:46.925
...endurance and longevity
should be very important to you.

451
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:51.138
Aerobic activity will keep you in shape...

452
00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:53.810
...and keep that heart rate up.

453
00:37:54.314 --> 00:37:57.227
Music, however,
makes it a little less painful.

454
00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:59.726
Hooks, cassette.

455
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.233
I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks
has chosen the appropriate music.

456
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:04.859
Oh-ho, no cassette.

457
00:38:05.074 --> 00:38:06.235
Let's go.

458
00:38:10.747 --> 00:38:13.205
Nice selection, Hooks. All right.

459
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:14.873
Slow walk. Slow start.

460
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:19.795
Keep your arms moving. That's good.

461
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:22.419
Into a nice slow jog. Okay!

462
00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:26.335
Arms moving. Keep breathing.
Don't forget to breathe.

463
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:30.264
Tuck his tummy, Hooks. Attagirl. Let's go.

464
00:38:45.114 --> 00:38:48.528
Now, this whistle can be very valuable...

465
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:51.201
...when walking through
a bad neighborhood.

466
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:54.120
If your purse gets snatched,
blow this whistle...

467
00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.791
...to alert your neighbors and the police
so they can help.

468
00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.619
Now, Mrs. Feldman,
would you play the victim?

469
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:04.924
- Yes.
- Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher.

470
00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:07.922
- Okay.
- Heh, go.

471
00:39:22.569 --> 00:39:24.060
Any questions?

472
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:48.133
Now, practice.

473
00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:04.191
You had him for, like, a minute.
He was scared. He was, like, flinching.

474
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.938
His face went:

475
00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:38.888
Sorry.

476
00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:43.980
- Citizens On Patrol. What a joke.
- Heh.

477
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.768
- You know what C.O.P. really stands for?
- Uh, no, sir. What?

478
00:40:47.987 --> 00:40:51.151
- Collection Of Pissants. That's not funny.
- Ha-ha. No, sir.

479
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:55.701
This citizen-action crap is a disaster,
a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it.

480
00:40:55.912 --> 00:40:57.119
Yes, sir.

481
00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:03.830
Excuse me, everyone.

482
00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:05.206
I mean, not everyone.

483
00:41:05.421 --> 00:41:08.880
Attention! Excuse me. Move it!

484
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:12.710
- Everybody, come over here!
- Hooks.

485
00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:17.219
Stop embarrassing the Police Department
and join your civilian buddies.

486
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:20.597
May I have your attention, please?
Hooks, the tank!

487
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:21.848
Ouch.

488
00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:24.897
- I'm so sorry.
- You dimwit!

489
00:41:29.946 --> 00:41:32.484
Today, Hooks, today.

490
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.324
Now, take your little munchkin voice
and go away.

491
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.042
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

492
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.212
Listen up!

493
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:54.218
This is the proper procedure
for administering oxygen.

494
00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:59.223
You place the mask securely
about the face of the patient...

495
00:41:59.434 --> 00:42:01.847
...and then have them breathe deeply.

496
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.641
Now, that is the way it's done...

497
00:42:08.818 --> 00:42:10.025
...in Capt. Harris' precinct.

498
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:14.229
What the hell? Hooks!

499
00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:24.077
So you gentlemen think
you're on a vacation?

500
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.709
You're no better than anyone else,
so let's go, let's get to work.

501
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.877
Come on, dudes, chill out.

502
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:33.882
You dudes are setting a bad example.

503
00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:38.262
Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see
I'm getting my beauty sleep?

504
00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:39.759
Oh, I'm sorry.

505
00:42:40.516 --> 00:42:41.723
Move it!

506
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:47.520
You sure told them.

507
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:52.230
Did you ever think about
maybe getting some contact lenses...

508
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:54.562
...or something, like, you know?

509
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.192
You'd look good in them.

510
00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:01.492
Proctor, this is an alley.

511
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:04.325
I know, sir, but these are the directions
Mahoney gave me.

512
00:43:04.499 --> 00:43:05.489
- Mahoney?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:08.200
He says this restaurant
has the best salad bar in town.

514
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:10.209
It damn sure better have.

515
00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:25.301
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

516
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:28.645
I don't see a salad bar.

517
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:32.478
Look, maybe they serve seafood, heh.

518
00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:34.810
That's not funny, you idiot.

519
00:43:37.532 --> 00:43:40.195
What are you looking at, you peckerhead?

520
00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:43.777
Nice uniform.
Makes me wish I'd worn my sailor outfit.

521
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.120
I'm getting out of here. Move it!

522
00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:54.746
Proctor!

523
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.421
I don't think cutting in is allowed, sir.

524
00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:00.047
Nice collar.

525
00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:17.152
Here we go again. Next round.
Mahoney weaving his way through...

526
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.438
...looking pretty good.
Gets past the main defense.

527
00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:21.068
And, under the leg!

528
00:44:21.242 --> 00:44:22.323
Oh.

529
00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:23.867
Nice shot!

530
00:44:24.078 --> 00:44:26.570
That man is a hot dog.
The crowd's gone wild!

531
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:31.034
The ball's brought in.
Here we go. We have the play going.

532
00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:32.826
Throws to Zed.

533
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.583
- Ahh!
- A little bit of a steal there.

534
00:44:36.299 --> 00:44:37.540
Hightower!

535
00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:40.881
Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower.

536
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:44.679
And then Hightower he...
The Doctor of Dunk scores!

537
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:49.268
You killed it. Really swift!

538
00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:51.390
Aha.

539
00:44:51.606 --> 00:44:52.972
Uh, some community action.

540
00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:57.227
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite!

541
00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:01.021
Thank you very much.

542
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:04.491
I'm honored to be--

543
00:45:08.998 --> 00:45:12.491
You know, uh,
Capt. Harris isn't gonna like this...

544
00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:14.793
...goofing off.

545
00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:18.543
- Oh, come on. This is community relations.
- No, Mahoney.

546
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:22.172
I'm an expert in goofing off,
and this is goofing off.

547
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:25.633
And I'm gonna have to tell him, heh.

548
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:29.596
- I have an urge to break him in half.
- Why fight it?

549
00:45:30.686 --> 00:45:34.396
No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy.
The creep's not worth it.

550
00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:45.565
- You through in there?
- Sure, go ahead.

551
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:46.901
Thanks.

552
00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:01.624
Excuse me, uh, Silvio?

553
00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:04.926
I wonder if you can help me.
I need some help over here.

554
00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:07.049
- Right there.
<i>- No problem.</i>

555
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:38.042
Hey, hey, hold your horses,
I'll be out in a minute!

556
00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.921
Okay, like, bring it in.

557
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:45.050
Just, like, bring it in a hair.

558
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.212
Watch out for the plane!

559
00:46:48.431 --> 00:46:50.468
Oh, the humanity, phew!

560
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:53.767
Okay, that's perfect. No, that's fine.

561
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:57.350
- Metro police.
- Special assignment.

562
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:43.016
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

563
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.899
<i>...please rise for our national anthem.</i>

564
00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:05.501
- Aah! Read that part about me again, Arnie.
- What part?

565
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.417
You know, the part about
the dynamic leader of the C.O.P.

566
00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:11.174
Get real! That's me they're talking about.

567
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:17.513
Good evening, gentlemen.

568
00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:19.348
I congratulate you on another good day.

569
00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.265
Sleep well, ha, ha.

570
00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:25.271
Hey, Count, getting worried
we're gonna be taking over soon?

571
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:26.727
We're ready.

572
00:48:26.946 --> 00:48:30.485
Hm, you're improving, guys. But you're still
way down in the food chain.

573
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:33.692
As we vampires say, "Lights out, suckers."

574
00:48:38.499 --> 00:48:40.411
This C.O.P. bit is a breeze.

575
00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:42.618
- We are ready.
- I concur.

576
00:48:42.837 --> 00:48:45.375
I think we're ready to bust
some truly major criminals.

577
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.127
Maybe we should go out and find some.

578
00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:53.508
Maybe we should become vigilantes.
Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes.

579
00:49:05.234 --> 00:49:07.897
Wake up, men! We need you. Now!

580
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.903
Come on.

581
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.359
What's going on? Where are we going?
Why are we here? What's happening?

582
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:18.491
You're here because you're ready.
You said you were ready.

583
00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:20.948
- One thing I--
- You're ready, now.

584
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.338
Could you be a little more specific
concerning our current mission?

585
00:49:36.557 --> 00:49:40.346
- We're apprehending two known felons.
- Uh, I'll be going home now.

586
00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.042
- Where are the rest?
- What rest? We're it.

587
00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:11.123
- We'll flush them out of the building.
- You stay behind, cut them off in the alley.

588
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.378
Stay.

589
00:50:12.968 --> 00:50:15.210
What about guns and shit, man?

590
00:50:15.429 --> 00:50:17.842
Guns? No, you won't be needing them.

591
00:50:18.057 --> 00:50:20.549
We're pretty sure they're not armed.

592
00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:53.082
They can handle this without us.
We'll just get in the way, you know.

593
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.381
Good thinking.

594
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.213
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

595
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.852
We got them, men!

596
00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:20.491
It's all right, men. Come on over.

597
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:27.707
All right, you three
will be riding in the back with Badula...

598
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.207
...and his late brother.

599
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:39.465
You guys keep him subdued.

600
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.426
Let's go.

601
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.833
Don't let his voodoo mumbo jumbo scare you.

602
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:28.143
Fools. To think
they can kill the brother of Badula.

603
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:30.095
I never thought that.

604
00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:35.893
Whoo. That I could reach into the belly
of a yak and rip out his heart.

605
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.979
That would bring him back to life?

606
00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:41.440
No, man. I'm hungry.

607
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:50.199
Listen, we're going for some burgers
and fries. We'll be right back.

608
00:53:30.374 --> 00:53:31.865
Out of my way!

609
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:43.418
I guess they weren't as ready
as they thought they were.

610
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:46.129
- You can take the mask off now, Tack.
- Heh.

611
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:58.937
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

612
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:02.863
- Who are all these people?
- Oh, they're here for the party, sir.

613
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:04.697
What party?

614
00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:09.202
A few of the Citizens On Patrol members
invited a few of their friends...

615
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:12.997
...and they invited a few of their friends.
You know how it goes, sir.

616
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:14.870
- A party?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:18.875
A party? Why wasn't I told?

618
00:54:21.383 --> 00:54:23.466
- Mahoney.
- Hey, Callahan.

619
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:26.006
Here you go.

620
00:54:27.222 --> 00:54:28.804
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

621
00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:31.929
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

622
00:54:32.144 --> 00:54:34.352
I'd like to thank you all for coming!

623
00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:36.224
Let's party!

624
00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:48.153
- Move those patooties.
- Excuse me.

625
00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:50.985
All police officers out of the pool!

626
00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:54.076
- Proctor!
- Let's go! Out, everybody out!

627
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.250
Sir, why don't you just
let everyone enjoy themselves?

628
00:54:57.461 --> 00:55:00.829
Why don't you just
kiss my rosy red ass, Mahoney?

629
00:55:02.883 --> 00:55:04.215
Rosy?

630
00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:06.713
Get out of that pool now!

631
00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:11.551
Just look at yourself.

632
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:19.265
You are a disgrace to the uniform!
Go get changed. Move it, move it, move it.

633
00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:31.739
- What are we looking for?
- This.

634
00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:37.331
- Why, Capt. Harris.
- Miss Mattson.

635
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:38.954
- Hello, heh.
- How are you?

636
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.535
Have you seen Clarence?

637
00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:44.289
Don't you let that fleabag near me.

638
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:47.467
Clarence is crazy about you, Captain.

639
00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:49.047
Let me just call him over.

640
00:55:49.263 --> 00:55:50.595
- No.
- For a second?

641
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:53.469
- No.
- Okay. Bye.

642
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:04.310
Wipe those grins off your faces,
buttbreaths! Dismissed!

643
00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:10.698
Hmm.

644
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:15.658
<i>Dr. Berman, please pick up line two.</i>

645
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:17.242
<i>Dr. Berman, line two, please.</i>

646
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:20.242
- You shouldn't be in here.
- How is Capt. Harris?

647
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.999
- We'll do all we can.
- Please, be gentle.

648
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.974
Um, I heard what Harris said,
and he's wrong.

649
00:56:44.693 --> 00:56:46.810
It happens to me all the time.

650
00:56:46.987 --> 00:56:48.694
People just don't understand me.

651
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:53.608
Maybe if you talked a little slower,
a little softer...

652
00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:57.912
That's not what I meant. I meant
people don't know who I really am.

653
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:01.578
Now I got to worry about my diction too?

654
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:05.040
- How's my sentence structure?
- Perfect.

655
00:57:07.799 --> 00:57:10.712
In fact, I think you're just about perfect.

656
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.459
I think I'm going to puke.

657
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.798
Hi, sir. How are you feeling?

658
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.263
I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

659
00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:42.975
I didn't catch that.

660
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.803
Was that, "the dim shoe to snare off"?

661
00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:51.184
I said I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

662
00:58:57.325 --> 00:59:01.990
So I asked her,
"Do you always work under podiums?"

663
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.037
Commandant?

664
00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:16.463
Why, Chief Hurst,
this is a splendid, splendid surprise!

665
00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:20.297
You remember Nogata?
He's part of our Japanese contingent.

666
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:22.222
This is Chief Hurst.

667
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:27.137
We have heard many, many
wonderful things about you and your city.

668
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:31.182
I've been helping them
with their English, heh.

669
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.688
- Please, sit. Please.
- Thank you.

670
00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:40.067
I hope you'll find the time
to, uh, see our beautiful city firsthand.

671
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:43.907
In fact, I've just flown here personally...

672
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:46.330
...to extend the mayor's invitation...

673
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.207
...to see my...

674
00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:53.622
To see Comdt. Lassard's
community program in action.

675
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:56.962
We are convinced
that this program will serve...

676
00:59:57.177 --> 01:00:00.511
...as a model for cities around the world.

677
01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.811
We would be honored
to accept your invitation.

678
01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.389
- Wonderful.
- Oh, please, come.

679
01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.019
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Arrivederci.</i>

680
01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.066
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

681
01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.997
I see you've been teaching them
something other than English.

682
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.665
Heh, I do what I can.

683
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.290
- So my program is really, really working?
- Hell, yes.

684
01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:38.838
Starting tomorrow,
C.O.Ps will be working the streets.

685
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.394
C.O.P. emergency. Feldman here.

686
01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.530
Meet me at the corner of
Clark and Main Street at the warehouse.

687
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.777
<i>10-4, Mrs. F.</i>

688
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.754
- $40, we're agreed?
- Okay, $40.

689
01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:20.550
Snap off a few shots for evidence.

690
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.923
Get closer.

691
01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:31.473
I saw this on <i>Hill Street Blues.</i>
It's a fencing operation.

692
01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.931
You're gonna love these.
We just unloaded a van full of them.

693
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.607
Okay, bring in the rest of it.

694
01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.104
Next case.

695
01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:47.531
Nice camera.
Don't let that crook give you less than $80.

696
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:55.164
Freeze, you scuzzbuckets!

697
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.337
This is a citizen's arrest. Get them, boys!

698
01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:15.100
You're not moving till the cops get here.

699
01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.649
I am the cops, lady.

700
01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:24.322
Three months' work
out the window, down the drain.

701
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.613
Your Citizens On Patrol just screwed up...

702
01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:31.787
...the single biggest
undercover police sting operation...

703
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.615
...in the history of this city!

704
01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.627
Tell them the good news, sir.

705
01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.380
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

706
01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:47.003
As of now,
the C.O.P. program is suspended...

707
01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.885
...pending a full investigation.

708
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.767
Ten-hut!

709
01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:11.744
Mahoney, I'm so, so proud
of the job you've done.

710
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.491
Nice work, men.

711
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:16.620
The eyes of the world are on this program.

712
01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.044
Excuse me, sir. I think we should talk.

713
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.384
This precinct must deal with
every type of criminal...

714
01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:30.087
from pickpockets to armed robbers,
felons of all kinds--

715
01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:34.347
Capt. Harris. Excuse me.
Um, don't forget the gang of ninjas.

716
01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.056
They're my personal favorites.

717
01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.942
Why don't you go pay them a visit?

718
01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:51.617
This precinct
is run on discipline and organization.

719
01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.946
Simon says, "Pull your left ear."

720
01:03:56.458 --> 01:04:00.577
Simon says, "Hop on your left foot."
Come on, guys.

721
01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.253
Simon says, "Hop on your right foot."

722
01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.422
It's a little too noisy in here, gentlemen.

723
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.713
We have important
police officials visiting...

724
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.389
...and I think you'd better show
the proper respect.

725
01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.516
Ah, come on, Lieutenant.
We're almost finished.

726
01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.721
Come on, lieutenant,
join us in a friendly game of Simon Says.

727
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:24.559
There's nothing to it.
Now, Simon says, "Touch your toes."

728
01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:29.026
Come on, lieutenant.
Simon says, "Clap your hands."

729
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.699
Come on, get in the spirit.

730
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.284
Simon says, "Two steps right."

731
01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:42.376
Simon says, "Five steps back."

732
01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.748
Put your hands up!

733
01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:50.259
Ha, ha, Simon didn't say.

734
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.632
No, but Smith & Wesson does.

735
01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:57.216
The high-security cell area
is used to hold criminals...

736
01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:01.349
...awaiting trial or transfer
to state or county facilities.

737
01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:04.098
Any convictions involving felons...

738
01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:09.236
...uh, perverts, thieves,
people of that nature, are held in this area.

739
01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:14.196
- You will notice the steel construction.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

740
01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:20.198
I think that explains it, sir.

741
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.542
Come on, hurry up!

742
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.022
<i>It's getting to the point now</i>

743
01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.561
<i>When I'm with you</i>

744
01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:53.856
<i>I no longer want to have
Something stuck in my eye</i>

745
01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:58.035
<i>Your mother, my mother
Ain't never looked like Florence Henderson</i>

746
01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.617
Heh, I wrote that for you.

747
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.253
Oh, Zed.

748
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.503
I hope now that C.O.P. is over...

749
01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.506
...it won't mean that we won't
be seeing each other anymore.

750
01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:15.711
- Shut up!
- Aah!

751
01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.256
Not you. I meant the ducks.

752
01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.345
Attention. This is Mrs. F.

753
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.554
<i>- There's been a jailbreak.</i>
- Zed, 10-4! Ha, ha!

754
01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.480
Tack, you pick me up at Main and Maple.

755
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.938
Move it! Over and out.

756
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.395
Commandant!

757
01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.403
Commandant! Commandant!

758
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.119
- There's been a jailbreak, sir.
- Get in.

759
01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:54.967
- It is so wonderful to see you again, baby.
- It's wonderful to be seen.

760
01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:59.968
- Just like old times.
- In America, talk is cheap.

761
01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:07.638
- There's been a jailbreak!
- Oh.

762
01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.775
Look, there's a stolen police car.
That's got to be it.

763
01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:18.740
I think we got a robbery in progress.

764
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.754
Stay here, Mrs. Feldman.

765
01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.343
Freeze!

766
01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.766
Good idea.

767
01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:54.356
All right, I want everybody
to get back in that vault.

768
01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.609
Yahoo!

769
01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.370
Book them, Tack, heh.

770
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.210
- There's a ninja now.
- I see him.

771
01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.872
Come on, let's get him. Let's go.

772
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.728
Do you see him?

773
01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.900
Oh, shit.

774
01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.413
All right. If it's a fight you want,
a fight you'll get.

775
01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:22.527
Damn you. You're gonna pay for that.

776
01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:39.832
Ha! Uh-oh.

777
01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:56.853
Yo!

778
01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.617
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

779
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.657
Shut up!

780
01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.660
Will you two morons knock it off!

781
01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.667
We've got an international incident
going on here!

782
01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.635
- I knew you'd come.
<i>- Ja, danke.</i>

783
01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:29.181
- You may thank Mrs. Feldman.
- Who is Mrs. Feldman?

784
01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:32.760
You know Mrs. Feldman,
a member of the defunct C.O.P. team.

785
01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.357
This is Sgt. Mahoney
in pursuit of a stolen police car.

786
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.692
<i>I'm headed towards
the Williams County air show.</i>

787
01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:49.072
<i>Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees
toward the Williams County air show.</i>

788
01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.117
<i>Now, folks,</i>
making his second appearance...

789
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.328
<i>...at the Williams County air show...</i>

790
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.956
Hey, hey, hey!

791
01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.163
Whoa!

792
01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.799
- Look out for that car!
- What car?

793
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.386
That car! Come on, get out!

794
01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:14.559
Come on!

795
01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.638
Let's get out of here!

796
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.936
Hurry up!

797
01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:13.986
This is where I draw the line.
I'm not going up in one of those things.

798
01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.198
- No way. No, sirree.
- You don't have to.

799
01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:40.186
Hey!

800
01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.852
You can open your eyes now.

801
01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.976
How can you like this
better than my driving?

802
01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.484
Because you can't do this in a car.

803
01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.549
Grab that balloon!

804
01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.756
We commandeer this balloon
in the name of the law!

805
01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.682
- No, wait, you can't!
- You can't do that. We need it for the race.

806
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.190
Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car.
Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me.

807
01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:37.911
Guys, wait up! Tackleberry.

808
01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.493
- What do I pull?
- Take it up!

809
01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:44.122
- They're getting away! Let's go!
- We are going up, sir.

810
01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:54.211
Come on! Drop the parachute!

811
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.721
Stop screwing around!

812
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.684
- Come on! Drop the parachute!
- Come on!

813
01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.512
If he doesn't want to do it, don't push him.

814
01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:06.018
He's gotta, like, wanna help himself.

815
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.573
You land that balloon right now!

816
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.157
This is Capt. Harris! You are under arrest!

817
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.115
Land that balloon now!

818
01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:28.249
- I'll just blast them out of the sky, sir.
- No! Not yet.

819
01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:32.257
You're right.
I should give them a warning shot first.

820
01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.594
Imbecile! Are you happy now?

821
01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.677
At least it looks like
we're coming down in the river.

822
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.389
It won't matter
because you're going to be dead!

823
01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:48.769
Pretty view--

824
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.989
I hate water!

825
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.820
Help!

826
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.656
Help!

827
01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:09.286
- They're in the river.
- Hurry. Maybe we can catch them.

828
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.633
I'll pull alongside Tackleberry.

829
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.258
Look, I see my house!

830
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.515
Look, the crooks!

831
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.765
- Whoa!
- Let's go get them, okay?

832
01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.662
Hang on, sir!

833
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.209
- Hurry, before they go over the falls!
- There they go!

834
01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:56.875
Get a rope!

835
01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.878
Hang on. Hang on, sir!

836
01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.849
Hang on, we'll come and get you!

837
01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:13.517
Grab it!

838
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.214
Try to relax!

839
01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.938
There's the balloon! Now I've got them.

840
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.825
There's only one way to do this
and it's up to me!

841
01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.960
- Take over!
- He was talking to you!

842
01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:16.455
If you're coming back, bring some beer!

843
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.713
Oomph!

844
01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:28.558
- No. He was talking to you.
- No, I heard him.

845
01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:33.184
- He said, "Sweetchuck, take over."
- No, he did not.

846
01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:39.652
- Get off of my foot!
- Shut up! Why are you always whining?

847
01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.696
Leave me alone!

848
01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.856
Gentlemen, may I see your license
and registration, please?

849
01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:21.687
There they are. Take it down.
I want to get close. Get closer.

850
01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:29.194
Mahoney, what are you doing?

851
01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.154
Get in closer!

852
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.548
What do you think you're doing?

853
01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.435
I'll take care of you, copper!

854
01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:57.184
Get off my wing! Get off of there!

855
01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.482
What will you do about them?

856
01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.943
Pal, it's over. Let's go home.

857
01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.287
- I hate you.
- I'm not really thrilled about you!

858
01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:20.955
- Why don't you lose some weight?
- Why don't you get out and walk?

859
01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.047
- I'm going to be sick!
- I don't have a parachute!

860
01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:31.257
- Shut up! I'm going to be sick!
- Don't be sick on me!

861
01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.857
- I don't have a chute!
- Break your fall!

862
01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:48.281
- Hit the kids!
- No, I need a chute!

863
01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:50.362
Get your own! Get away from me!

864
01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:52.159
Come on!

865
01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.366
Let go!

866
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.407
I'll break you in half, you dweeb.

867
01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.040
There, I opened the chute.
Are you satisfied? Leave me alone!

868
01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:10.550
- I'm going to kill you!
- Shut up and enjoy the flight!

869
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.102
Get off me!

870
01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:32.067
Commandant, they say
your Citizens On Patrol group...

871
01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:36.371
...does many, many
wonderful and crazy things.

872
01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:48.838
I think Sgt. Mahoney
deserves a special bow.

873
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.002
- Mahoney?
- All right!

874
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.846
Mahoney?

875
01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:56.015
Mahoney!

876
01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:03.348
Mahoney.

877
01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.399
Get up! Look, it's Mahoney!

878
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.398
- Where?
- Sorry.

879
01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:14.659
- To the Academy.
- To the Academy.

880
01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:24.623
You know, you look
a little like Tom Cruise in <i>Top Gun.</i>

881
01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:26.579
- Yeah?
- No!
