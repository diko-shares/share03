1
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.538
Take it, brother.

2
00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:54.499
Let me break you.

3
00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.339
Man, that was funky.

4
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.739
- Fore!
- Well, I guess the meeting's started.

5
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.859
- Howdy, sir?
- Mahoney! Jones!

6
00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:10.139
Thank you, Sweetchuck.

7
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.139
I've had the most wonderful news
about my new program.

8
00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.819
- What new program is that, sir?
- My citizens on patrol.

9
00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.579
I call it C.O.P. for short.

10
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.818
Has a nice police-y ring to it,
don't you think?

11
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.139
What is C.O.P., sir?

12
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.818
What is the most frustrating thing
about police work?

13
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.459
- Not being able to carry hand grenades.
- Separate locker rooms, sir.

14
00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.259
Icky blue uniforms.

15
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.178
I always thought that the most
frustrating thing was that...

16
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.098
we couldn't be everywhere at once
to solve every crime.

17
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.218
So the public ends up
thinking of us as enemies.

18
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.859
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could all be friends?

19
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.299
Officer Mahoney,
please come in.

20
00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.419
Have some lemonade.
I love lemonade.

21
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.018
- Not too tart, not...
- Too sweet, just, mm, mm, good.

22
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.458
So C.O.P. is
a community action program, sir.

23
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.779
- Like Neighborhood Watch?
- More. Much more!

24
00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.379
We show the community
that we care.

25
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.019
We train volunteers in crime detection,
in first-aid and...

26
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.938
- And it's a great idea, sir.
- But we need citizen support.

27
00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.098
With all this neighborhood crime,
I'm sure you'll get it.

28
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.099
- Fore!
- Right. What if we were to...

29
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.018
What was that?

30
00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.178
I believe brother Sweetchuck
is suggesting...

31
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.258
we recruit in our old neighborhood.

32
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.339
Excellent. We have the full support
of the mayor...

33
00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.419
and best of all, the governor of the
state wants me to unveil the program...

34
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.899
at the end of the
International Police Seminar...

35
00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.539
next month in England.

36
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.058
While I attend the seminar...

37
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.058
you, my good friends...

38
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.219
will put C.O.P. into action.

39
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.899
We'll change community relations
all around the world.

40
00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.418
The Lassard Method.

41
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.818
It rolls nicely off the tongue,
don't you think?

42
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.219
Hi! What did I miss?

43
00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:20.019
Hi.

44
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.178
<i>Mama's little baby loves
shortnin' bread</i>

45
00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:35.019
Capt. Harris,
Police Commissioner Hurst is here.

46
00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:36.298
You want to see him?

47
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.098
No. Send him packing.

48
00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:40.459
Yes, sir.

49
00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.979
- Proctor!
- Yes, sir?

50
00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:45.579
Send the Commissioner in
immediately.

51
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.819
- I thought you said to send 'm packing.
- Immediately!

52
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.179
Yes, sir.

53
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:52.898
Nincompoop.

54
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.018
Commissioner.

55
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.259
- You have a problem, Capt. Harris?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:04.899
I am extremely concerned
with this memorandum from Lassard...

57
00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.739
about his C.O.P. program.

58
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.179
Citizens doing police work?
An asinine idea.

59
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.059
If this goes through, no policeman's job,
no policeman's paycheck, will be safe.

60
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.619
Are you through, captain?

61
00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.259
The governor of this state thinks
that this program is absolutely brilliant.

62
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.978
So until he changes his mind,
that's what you and I think too.

63
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.498
Agreed?

64
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.299
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

65
00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.699
You were right.
You should have sent him packing.

66
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.898
I don't give a damn
what the governor or the mayor thinks.

67
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.259
Lassard's program is a mistake...

68
00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:50.898
and anyone who thinks otherwise
is wrong.

69
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.058
Pure and simple.

70
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.658
Don't touch those!

71
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.019
Don't you ever touch my balls
without asking!

72
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.298
You're gonna have to leave.
I'll call the police. I mean it.

73
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.578
Okay, I'm going.
I'm out of here.

74
00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.099
Wait a minute.
I am the police.

75
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.098
- No, you're not.
- That's me. I'm to speak about C.O.P.

76
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.539
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Without the uniform on...

77
00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:40.059
Regular human clothes
make people more comfortable.

78
00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:45.778
Hi, ladies.
Let's do some poetry!

79
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.618
I got to go to my in-laws'
for dinner tonight.

80
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.778
You want to come?

81
00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.698
Officer Hightower,
I'm here to join the new C.O.P. Program.

82
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.098
Do I know you?

83
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.298
Yeah, you used to
bounce me on your knee.

84
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.659
- I did?
- Yeah. Little Tommy Conklin.

85
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.779
- But now they call me House.
- Tommy Conklin. Tommy Conklin.

86
00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:18.538
Sure. Welcome aboard.
You can register right over there.

87
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.339
Blind mouth
that scare themselves.

88
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.939
Know how to hold
a sheep hook.

89
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.658
Or have learned
aught else at least.

90
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.699
That to the faithful herdsmans'
art belongs.

91
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.418
Ah, that was exciting.

92
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.619
We have an Officer Zed,
who's here to tell us...

93
00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:06.938
a little bit about my new police
program, so won't you...

94
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.978
Thank you very much.

95
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.299
Oof. I'm sorry.
I'm an emotional, sensitive guy...

96
00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:23.538
and that part about the sheep hook
just tore my heart right out.

97
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.258
I have my own poem
that I prepared for you today.

98
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.098
Gene, Gene made a machine.

99
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.738
And Joe, Joe made it go.

100
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.179
I blew a fart and blew
the whole damn thing apart.

101
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.179
What is he saying?

102
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.979
I didn't write it.

103
00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:48.859
Okay, I'd like to talk to you
about what we're here for...

104
00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:51.938
and that's for me to pitch
the new C.O.P. program to you.

105
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.579
Perhaps a few of you ladies
might be interested in it.

106
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.498
So the bartender asked
the organ grinder...

107
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.499
Hey, does your monkey sing
any opera?

108
00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:03.539
And I said, nope.

109
00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:06.259
But if you hit me on the head,
I'll sing Yankee Doodle.

110
00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:16.338
Ooh, it's so nice to have my family
all back together again.

111
00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.458
- Can you pass the lettuce, Pop?
- Oh, sure, honey. Here you go.

112
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.699
- Thanks, Pop.
- You're welcome. Hey, listen...

113
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.579
Did I tell you I'm gonna join
that Citizen On Patrol thing?

114
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.098
That would be a great idea.
I'd be proud to have you at the precinct.

115
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.339
I'll take some more
greens, Bud.

116
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.779
- Dad.
- Yeah?

117
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.699
I don't think you should sign up. There
are already three of us on the force.

118
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.019
- It's going to look like favoritism.
- That's not it.

119
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.618
That's not it at all. You just don't think
I'm fast enough anymore, do you?

120
00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:53.699
I don't think that's it,
do you, Tack?

121
00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.138
It has nothing to do
with being fast.

122
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.779
Now, that was fast, huh?

123
00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:01.738
You know, that was fast.

124
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.738
But that's hard.

125
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.459
Excuse me.

126
00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:13.299
I think Bud hurt Pop's feelings.

127
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.818
Oh, you two.

128
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.898
Oh, well, who wants pie?

129
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:39.259
- I was just trying to help.
- You hurt my arm.

130
00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:41.699
- I'll hand the rest out. Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:44.899
Could I interest you
in the new citizens program?

132
00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:46.939
- No, I don't think so.
- No, thanks.

133
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.178
- We'll take the stairs.
- Thanks, just the same.

134
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.019
Excuse me!

135
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.699
Would you be interested
in the new citizens program?

136
00:11:56.339 --> 00:12:00.178
- Yes, in fact, we didn't hear you right.
- Sure, here.

137
00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:04.418
- Why don't you hand the rest out?
- Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.

138
00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:13.259
- Arnie, where are you going?
- Home. I got a boatload of stuff to do.

139
00:12:13.459 --> 00:12:16.259
I got a term paper due tomorrow,
and a history test.

140
00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:20.499
I got to help my father clean the cellar,
and I have to do the dishes tonight.

141
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.698
What are you doing?

142
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.899
- I'll get the guys, hang out at the mall.
- Let's go.

143
00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:28.739
Hey, Artie, Kyle.

144
00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:33.058
I thought I told you guys,
no skateboarding in my district.

145
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.019
This isn't skateboarding, sergeant.
This is carrying skateboards.

146
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.418
This is skateboarding.

147
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.179
- We got to check this out, you guys.
- Take it easy.

148
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.658
We'll see you later.

149
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.938
I'll see you later.
I want to check out these guys.

150
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.619
All right, I'll be back.

151
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.019
Hey, sarge, look at that.

152
00:14:39.219 --> 00:14:42.579
- Kyle, that skateboard punk.
- Let's nail him.

153
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.018
Boy, you sure give them
a hard time.

154
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.498
Yeah. Fun, isn't it?

155
00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:55.818
You don't listen, do you, Kyle?

156
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.339
I was shopping for
Capt. Harris' birthday present.

157
00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.938
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

158
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.499
Shop somewhere else.

159
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.578
Oh, Your Honor...

160
00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:09.899
Here, judge. Stop him!
Hold up!

161
00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:12.818
Excuse me, pardon me.
Excuse me, my fault.

162
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.579
- Watch it!
- Stop! Stop that skateboarder! Hold it!

163
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.778
I can do that,
that handstand stuff.

164
00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:24.938
I just hate it when
the change falls out of my pocket.

165
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.579
Hey, man, I think
these guys want to talk to you.

166
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.979
Hold it!

167
00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:38.338
Capt. Harris will hear about this!

168
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.618
Come.

169
00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:06.458
- Sir.
- Copeland, what the hell happened?

170
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.979
Some skateboard punks
started a riot at the mall.

171
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.539
Bring them in here.

172
00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:13.019
- They got away.
- They got away?

173
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:17.138
- I did the best I could, sir.
- It wasn't enough, was it, Copeland?

174
00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:21.059
- No, sir.
- I'll handle these punks personally.

175
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.938
- Yes, sir.
- I want three patrol cars...

176
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.138
dissecting the neighborhood.
Copeland, my hat!

177
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.499
- Yes, sir.
- You, radio-alert all motorcycle units.

178
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.259
I want a chopper in the air.
Spot these boys on the ground.

179
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.379
Proctor, ride with me.

180
00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:35.698
- Now, Proctor, move it!
- Coming, sir.

181
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.138
Be right there!

182
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.739
There they go!

183
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.858
Back it up. Quiet!

184
00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:56.459
I said quiet, dickhead.

185
00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.579
We've got them now.

186
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:13.098
I know they came in here.

187
00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.059
Unit 6 to Capt. Harris.
We've got them at the end of the alley.

188
00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:31.658
I got you now!

189
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.498
You hold them right there.
We're coming.

190
00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:39.458
Copeland, have you got them?

191
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.419
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

192
00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:43.538
I'm Carey Mahoney
of the Police Academy.

193
00:17:45.219 --> 00:17:48.539
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Please. Thank you. You're too kind.

194
00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:53.418
Jones.

195
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.339
It's Harris. Haul ass. Go.

196
00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:04.978
I got you, you little punks.

197
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.939
Freeze, you little hoodlums.
Get your hands off my ass, Proctor.

198
00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:13.779
Get away, Proctor.

199
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.498
Proctor.

200
00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:29.898
No. Don't shake the fence.

201
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.939
Oh, shit. No!

202
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.259
The purpose of this program...

203
00:18:44.459 --> 00:18:48.259
is to develop a better working
relationship between us, the police...

204
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.138
When he says, okay, boys and girls,
we're all gonna...

205
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.818
And you, the community.

206
00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:02.899
Stop! Stop right there!

207
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.939
You see, the great thing is,
this is a first.

208
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.499
The Police Academy has offered to train
citizens to better protect yourselves.

209
00:19:12.699 --> 00:19:15.619
- You'll be trendsetters.
- Do we get to pack heat?

210
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.299
Heat...

211
00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:25.298
Stop those little punks!
Stop them!

212
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.138
You're under arrest!

213
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.739
Are you all right?

214
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.499
Who's laughing now,
you little twits?

215
00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:41.139
And your clothes make me want to
puke. I'll tell you that right now.

216
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.098
- Capt. Harris!
- Well, well, Mahoney.

217
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.059
- It's been a long time, sir.
- So it has.

218
00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:50.099
Well, Motormouth Jones.

219
00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:53.619
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a great tailor, sir?

220
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.778
I mentioned that just last week.

221
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.418
Has anyone told you, Mahoney,
that you're still a little pissant?

222
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.779
- No one whose opinion matters, sir.
- What did Arnie and Kyle do?

223
00:20:03.979 --> 00:20:07.698
Ooh, you know those clowns?
I should have figured.

224
00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:12.378
Your little pals wrecked a police car,
destroyed a shopping mall...

225
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.818
harassed citizens,
resisted arrest.

226
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.979
Go easy, captain.
They're just wacky kids.

227
00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:20.379
We'll see how those wacky kids
like it in jail.

228
00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:27.018
In all my years on the bench,
I have seen all sorts of public disorder.

229
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.339
Young people must learn to conform...

230
00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:32.419
to the standards and laws
of civilized society.

231
00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:35.938
In reviewing the testimony
and taking into account...

232
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.378
your disregard
for public and private property...

233
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.938
I can reach only one decision.

234
00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:45.818
Guilty as hell.

235
00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:50.459
You flushed me down the toilet!

236
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:53.059
Before you pass sentence...

237
00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:56.258
They're gonna send me to jail,
and some fat, hairy guy is gonna...

238
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.258
- May I approach the bench, Honor?
- Yes, sergeant.

239
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.139
Sir, do we want to expose these boys,
these children to a prison environment?

240
00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:07.618
- Yes.
- May I run my own court, captain?

241
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.899
- You've got a better idea?
- Yes, I do, sir.

242
00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:13.098
Comdt. Lassard has initiated
a new community relations program.

243
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.259
Why not assign these kids...

244
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.739
to that program
as a form of alternate sentencing?

245
00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:20.658
- That's ridiculous!
- I'll be the judge of that.

246
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.339
I... Excuse me.

247
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.858
I like the sound of this
community relations gig.

248
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.499
Milt Butterworth,
defender of the common man.

249
00:21:30.699 --> 00:21:34.059
Your Honor,
look at this list of complaints.

250
00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.858
And I quote you directly, sir,
when I say...

251
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.458
Sir, I thought you only got contempt
of court for opening your mouth.

252
00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:57.258
Mahoney, I'm warning you.

253
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.499
You keep Lassard's C.O.P.s
out of my precinct.

254
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.539
You don't understand
what I'm trying to do.

255
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.739
I understand exactly
what you're trying to do.

256
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.138
Just keep them out,
especially these two little buttwads.

257
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.738
Excuse me, sir,
but you're not planning to attack us...

258
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.499
with any more of your bodily
functions, are you?

259
00:22:15.939 --> 00:22:20.099
You just make sure
that we never meet again. Ever.

260
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.138
You know, with those two idiots
in Lassard's program, it'll never work.

261
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.739
Excuse me, sir.

262
00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:55.018
We're looking for a Mrs. Feldman.

263
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.979
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

264
00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.498
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know a Mrs. Lois...

265
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.459
- Where can we find Lois Feldman?
- There.

266
00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:12.499
Thank you.

267
00:23:18.859 --> 00:23:20.059
Mrs. Feldman?

268
00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:21.979
- Who's asking?
- Police.

269
00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:24.979
Is it about those damn
library books?

270
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.179
We're following up on your alleged
interest in Citizens On Patrol program.

271
00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:33.418
Ooh, then I'm Mrs. Feldman.
Come on in.

272
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.898
Callahan, cover your rear.

273
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.139
I admire your taste.

274
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.218
Yes, well,
I do all my own decorating.

275
00:23:56.459 --> 00:23:58.218
You have a talent for it, ma'am.

276
00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.499
I'll be with you in a moment, sarge.

277
00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:03.858
Perhaps you'd like to discuss
the program first, ma'am.

278
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.419
What's to discuss?

279
00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:08.938
Think I want to hang out here
and listen to arteries hardening?

280
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.459
Where did I put
that bulletproof vest?

281
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:28.179
All right, fall in!
Come on, please, line up.

282
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.178
Come on, I need a lineup here.

283
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.859
Hello, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen...

284
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.338
- Thank you, Miss...
- Mrs. Feldman.

285
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.538
Mrs. Feldman.

286
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.498
I want to welcome all of you
to the Academy.

287
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.178
You are part of a new
and exciting program that I call...

288
00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:11.379
- I call C.O.P.
- C.O.P.

289
00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:15.899
- Citizens On Patrol.
- Citizens On Patrol.

290
00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:18.898
- Citizens On Patrol!
- Citizens On Patrol!

291
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.779
You will work and train
with the police.

292
00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:25.178
The police will work
and train with you.

293
00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:29.099
Working and training,
training and working.

294
00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:30.739
Excuse me, commandant.

295
00:25:30.939 --> 00:25:34.139
But do you expect the community
to do the job of the police force?

296
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.338
There are many, many jobs
for many, many people.

297
00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:40.938
Sir, I'll take care of this.

298
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:43.939
Excuse me, young lady,
what the commandant means...

299
00:25:44.139 --> 00:25:46.458
is that this program
will promote understanding...

300
00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.539
between the community
and the police...

301
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.938
and make the community
more active in crime prevention.

302
00:25:52.499 --> 00:25:54.339
Active in crime prevention?

303
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.099
- Won't that be dangerous?
- No. We just want to teach citizens...

304
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.339
to prevent crimes from taking place.

305
00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:05.618
It sounds fine in theory.
Let's hope it works in practice.

306
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.099
I like him.
He's a really nice fish.

307
00:26:12.499 --> 00:26:13.858
He looks a little like you.

308
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.939
I will attend an international
police seminar in London.

309
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.539
It would be the crowning
achievement of my career...

310
00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:25.778
if I could close this seminar...

311
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.938
by bringing instructors
from all around the world...

312
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.299
here to watch
the C.O.P. program in action.

313
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.459
I'm counting on all of you
to make that possible.

314
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.819
In Comdt. Lassard's absence...

315
00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:44.338
I've appointed a very able-bodied
and experienced officer...

316
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.818
to run the Academy.

317
00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:49.219
Perfect timing.
Here he is now.

318
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.978
Attention!

319
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.218
Two weeks of Harris?
Damn!

320
00:27:12.979 --> 00:27:14.058
Damn.

321
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.739
Deodorant? Thanks.

322
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.979
Straighten this mess up.

323
00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:26.659
- What mess?
- Now!

324
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.179
I want all of you dirtbags
and that group of C.O.P. people...

325
00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:33.018
out in front of this dormitory
at 1400 hours.

326
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.139
Move it!

327
00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:38.419
Sir, we were just commenting
on how you'd mellowed.

328
00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:43.619
- Captain?
- What is it, Mahoney?

329
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.058
I hope you're gonna
give this program a fair chance.

330
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.379
This program, Mahoney,
is just like you, a bad idea.

331
00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:52.099
That's your opinion, sir.

332
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.218
But this is Comdt. Lassard's idea,
and his Academy.

333
00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.498
Things can change, Mahoney.

334
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:02.738
Oh, yes, things can change.

335
00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:04.938
I'll see you out front.

336
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.579
I bet that was refreshing, sir.

337
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.819
Over the next two weeks...

338
00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:30.218
you'll go through
a modified training program.

339
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.778
You'll learn many, many keys
to crime prevention.

340
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.298
Keys you can teach many, many others
in your community.

341
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.258
Modified? Modified nothing.
I want the works.

342
00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.099
- Yeah.
- Madam...

343
00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:47.218
I think it's time
for a dose of reality.

344
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.098
You can forget Lassard's hype.

345
00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:55.059
You people do not belong here.

346
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.099
Especially you and you.

347
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.899
Community action groups mean
one thing, and one thing only.

348
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.618
I hope that wasn't gum.

349
00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.978
You heard the captain.
Is it?

350
00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:21.699
It's definitely gum, sir. Bubble gum.
Cherry, I think.

351
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.819
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

352
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.299
These groups only mean
citizens getting in the way of the police.

353
00:29:31.499 --> 00:29:33.698
Now, I don't get involved
in your business...

354
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.458
and I don't want you involved
in my...

355
00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:41.618
Now, if you were smart...

356
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.498
you would go home
and forget this stupid idea...

357
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.939
Are those wedding bells
I hear, sir?

358
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:58.378
- Whose damn mutt is this?
- It's my damn mutt.

359
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.139
I want him out of here!

360
00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:04.459
- But, sir...
- Out!

361
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.659
Out!

362
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:11.499
I am not getting rid of Clarence.
He's my pet.

363
00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:15.218
Why should you?
After all, Harris has Proctor.

364
00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:17.259
I'll take him.

365
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.819
I have a big house, nice yard.

366
00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:23.139
See, he likes me.
We'll get along fine.

367
00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:26.299
Me too? I'm housebroken.

368
00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:29.059
Come on, C.O.P.s,
let's step up to the white line!

369
00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:32.459
Let's line ourselves up with a slot,
then let's listen to Mr. Jones.

370
00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:34.578
Thank you, Sgt. Tackleberry.

371
00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:39.339
This is a standard police
issue .38.

372
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.578
Examine this weapon carefully.

373
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.778
You must be sure
this weapon is not loaded.

374
00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.979
You will be responsible for the loading
and unloading of this weapon yourself.

375
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.299
Now, Sgt. Tackleberry.

376
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.459
You want to become one
with the gun.

377
00:30:57.459 --> 00:31:01.139
Feel the gun, caress the gun...

378
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.258
until it's a living,
breathing, vibrating...

379
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.459
extension of yourself.

380
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.178
I look for the same in a woman.

381
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.299
This sucker's not loaded.

382
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.338
You won't be using live ammo.

383
00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:20.219
Tack, how about letting me squeeze off
a few rounds of that baby?

384
00:31:20.419 --> 00:31:21.738
Tack?

385
00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:24.378
Affirmative, Mrs. F.

386
00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:29.458
Now, be careful because
a .44 magnum has quite a...

387
00:31:31.939 --> 00:31:33.018
kick.

388
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.898
Damn, that was fun!

389
00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.378
Rescuing the drowning victim.

390
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.098
Now, when approaching
a potentially dangerous...

391
00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:46.499
and out-of-control victim,
use this stroke only.

392
00:31:46.699 --> 00:31:48.419
Arms out of the way for protection.

393
00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:52.099
Now, when you get victim in control,
you slip your arm across his chest...

394
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.578
under his opposite arm.

395
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.099
Rest his head and his neck
against your shoulder.

396
00:31:56.299 --> 00:31:59.699
Kick with your feet.
Now, your victim could be struggling.

397
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.058
Struggle, House. Good, House...

398
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.339
House!

399
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.179
Really swift! I'll get him!

400
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.379
Arnie, get out of the pool!
You just ate!

401
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.298
Get him out of here!

402
00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:46.299
Thanks, pal.

403
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.139
Now we have an opportunity
to start our water safety lesson.

404
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.059
I will play the drowning victim.

405
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.859
Arnie?

406
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.379
Now, who's going to save me?

407
00:33:12.579 --> 00:33:14.179
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

408
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.299
That was mighty brave.
I admire that.

409
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.219
That was nothing.

410
00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.578
You don't have a hair dryer,
or perhaps some mousse?

411
00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:57.818
No. Your hair looks nice.
It's very stylish.

412
00:33:58.259 --> 00:34:00.138
Moi? Stylish?

413
00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.698
Oh, I think I'd better be going.

414
00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:05.618
Mickey!

415
00:34:07.419 --> 00:34:09.579
He's dead! He killed him!

416
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.699
- I'm sure the Academy will pay for it.
- What about the sentimental value?

417
00:34:13.899 --> 00:34:15.699
This is a family heirloom here.

418
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.179
This is the last thing I ever stole
before joining the Academy.

419
00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:22.979
What the hell is this?
Cadets in heat?

420
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.739
No. We were just, like, talking.

421
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.539
Oh, just, like, talk somewhere else.

422
00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:30.779
This is not a spawning pool.
I want discipline.

423
00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.179
Do I make myself clear, Zed?

424
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.059
Discipline!

425
00:34:36.499 --> 00:34:38.179
- Jerk.
- What?

426
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.699
He said bye.

427
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.019
No. I said jerk.
I think it was pretty clear.

428
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.819
- I said, jerk.
- Jerk.

429
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.658
<i>Wait, said the daisy,
sweet buttercup</i>

430
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.138
<i>Time to get up</i>

431
00:34:56.939 --> 00:34:58.899
<i>Time to get up</i>

432
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.979
<i>As a daisy, sweet buttercup</i>

433
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.018
<i>Time to get up, time to get up</i>

434
00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:25.618
Cadets, I'd now like
to discuss with you...

435
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.019
something that will be
vital for you to know...

436
00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:31.579
when you're, like, out there on
the job as a police officer.

437
00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:34.579
And that's the correct way
to eat a doughnut.

438
00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:37.418
- A doughnut...
- Attention!

439
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.698
Captain Harris.

440
00:35:48.939 --> 00:35:52.819
From this moment on, anyone
who misplaces their canister of Mace...

441
00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:54.979
will be reprimanded and fined.

442
00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.339
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

443
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.059
Bye.

444
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.978
As Citizens On Patrol...

445
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.579
endurance and longevity
should be very important to you.

446
00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:19.618
Aerobic activity will keep
you in shape...

447
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.179
and keep that heart rate up.

448
00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:25.459
Music, however,
makes it a little less painful.

449
00:36:25.819 --> 00:36:27.858
Hooks, cassette.

450
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.219
I have confidence that Sgt. Hooks
has chosen the appropriate music.

451
00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:32.778
Oh-ho, no cassette.

452
00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.099
Let's go.

453
00:36:38.419 --> 00:36:40.778
Nice selection, Hooks.
All right.

454
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.378
Slow walk. Slow start.

455
00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:47.099
Keep your arms moving.
That's good.

456
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.619
Into a nice slow jog.
Okay!

457
00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.378
Arms moving. Keep breathing.
Don't forget to breathe.

458
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.139
Tuck his tummy, Hooks.
Attagirl. Let's go.

459
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.659
Now, this whistle
can be very valuable...

460
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.218
when walking through
a bad neighborhood.

461
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.019
If your purse gets snatched,
blow this whistle...

462
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.538
to alert your neighbors and the police
so they can help.

463
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.258
Now, Mrs. Feldman,
would you play the victim?

464
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.378
- Yes.
- Okay, and I'll be Mr. Purse Snatcher.

465
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.258
- Okay.
- Go.

466
00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:48.739
Any questions?

467
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.818
Now, practice.

468
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.219
You had him for, like, a minute.
He was scared. He was, like, flinching.

469
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.899
His face went...

470
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:00.498
Sorry.

471
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.379
Citizens On Patrol.
What a joke.

472
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.018
- You know what C.O.P. really stands for?
- No, sir. What?

473
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.259
- Collection Of Pissants. That isn't funny.
- No, sir.

474
00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:16.619
This citizen-action crap is a disaster,
a bad idea, and I'm going to prove it.

475
00:39:16.819 --> 00:39:17.979
Yes, sir.

476
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.419
Excuse me, everyone.

477
00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:25.738
I mean, not everyone.

478
00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.259
Attention!
Excuse me. Move it!

479
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.939
- Everybody, come over here!
- Hooks.

480
00:39:33.139 --> 00:39:37.258
Stop embarrassing Police Department
and join your civilian buddies.

481
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.499
May I have your attention, please?
Hooks, the tank!

482
00:39:41.899 --> 00:39:44.619
- I'm so sorry.
- You dimwit!

483
00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:51.899
Today, Hooks, today.

484
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.299
Now, take your little munchkin voice
and go away.

485
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.939
Listen up!

486
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.739
This is the proper procedure
for administering oxygen.

487
00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:17.539
You place the mask securely
about the face of the patient...

488
00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:20.058
and then have them
breathe deeply.

489
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.579
Now, that is the way it's done...

490
00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:27.899
in Capt. Harris' precinct.

491
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.939
What the hell? Hooks!

492
00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:41.379
So you gentlemen think
you're on a vacation?

493
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.858
You're no better than anyone else,
so let's go, let's get to work.

494
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.938
Come on, dudes, chill out.

495
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.778
You dudes are setting
a bad example.

496
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.979
Can't hear you, bro. Can't you see
I'm getting my beauty sleep?

497
00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:56.419
Oh, I'm sorry.

498
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.298
Move it!

499
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.859
You sure told them.

500
00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:08.379
Did you ever think about
maybe getting some contact lenses...

501
00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:10.619
or something, like, you know?

502
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.138
You'd look good in them.

503
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.258
Proctor, this is an alley.

504
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.978
I know, sir, but these are the directions
Mahoney gave me.

505
00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:21.098
- Mahoney?
- Yes, sir.

506
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.698
He says this restaurant
has the best salad bar in town.

507
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.618
It damn sure better have.

508
00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:40.099
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

509
00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:43.298
I don't see a salad bar.

510
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.978
Look, maybe they serve seafood.

511
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.219
That's not funny, you idiot.

512
00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:54.378
What are you looking at,
you peckerhead?

513
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.818
Nice uniform. Makes me wish
I'd worn my sailor outfit.

514
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.939
I'm getting out of here.
Move it!

515
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.339
Proctor!

516
00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.859
I don't think cutting in
is allowed, sir.

517
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.419
Nice collar.

518
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.819
Here we go again. Next round.
Mahoney weaving his way through...

519
00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.019
looking pretty good,
gets past the main defense.

520
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.579
And, under the leg!

521
00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:36.259
Nice shot!

522
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.858
That man is a hot dog.
The crowd's gone wild!

523
00:42:39.659 --> 00:42:43.139
The ball's brought in.
Here we go. We have the play going.

524
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.858
Throws to Zed.

525
00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.498
A little bit of a steal there.

526
00:42:48.179 --> 00:42:49.378
Hightower!

527
00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:52.579
Mahoney throws a pass to Hightower.

528
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.219
And then Hightower he...
The Doctor of Dunk scores!

529
00:42:57.899 --> 00:43:00.618
You killed it. Really swift!

530
00:43:02.859 --> 00:43:04.178
Some community action.

531
00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:08.259
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Lt. Proctor, a ghetto favorite!

532
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.898
Thank you very much.

533
00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:15.219
I'm honored to be...

534
00:43:19.539 --> 00:43:22.899
You know, Capt. Harris
isn't gonna like this...

535
00:43:23.699 --> 00:43:25.099
goofing off.

536
00:43:25.299 --> 00:43:28.699
- Come on. This is community relations.
- No, Mahoney.

537
00:43:28.899 --> 00:43:32.178
I'm an expert in goofing off,
and this is goofing off.

538
00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:35.498
And I'm gonna have to tell him.

539
00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:39.298
- I have an urge to break him in half.
- Why fight it?

540
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.899
No, Hightower. Take it easy, big guy.
The creep's not worth it.

541
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.619
- You through in there?
- Sure, go ahead.

542
00:43:54.819 --> 00:43:55.898
Thanks.

543
00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:10.018
Excuse me, Silvio?

544
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.178
I wonder if you can help me.
I need some help over here.

545
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.218
- Right there.
- No problem.

546
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.939
Hey, hey, hold your horses,
I'll be out in a minute!

547
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.659
Okay, like, bring it in.

548
00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:51.659
Just, like, bring it in a hair.

549
00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.699
Watch out for the plane!

550
00:44:54.899 --> 00:44:56.859
Oh, the humanity, phew!

551
00:44:57.059 --> 00:45:00.019
Okay, that's perfect.
No, that's fine.

552
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.459
- Metro police.
- Special assignment.

553
00:45:45.459 --> 00:45:47.258
Ladies and gentlemen...

554
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.018
please rise for our national anthem.

555
00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.818
- Read that part about me again, Arnie.
- What part?

556
00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:11.619
You know, the part about
the dynamic leader of the C.O.P.

557
00:46:11.819 --> 00:46:14.258
Get real!
That's me they're talking about.

558
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.338
Good evening, gentlemen.

559
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.098
I congratulate you
on another good day.

560
00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:24.899
Sleep well.

561
00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:27.779
Hey, Count, getting worried
we're gonna be taking over soon?

562
00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:29.179
We're ready.

563
00:46:29.379 --> 00:46:32.778
You're improving, guys. But you're
still way down in the food chain.

564
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.859
As we vampires say,
lights out, suckers.

565
00:46:40.459 --> 00:46:42.299
This C.O.P. bit is a breeze.

566
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.419
- We are ready.
- I concur.

567
00:46:44.619 --> 00:46:47.058
I think we're ready to bust
some truly major criminals.

568
00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.699
Maybe we should go out
and find some.

569
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.858
Maybe we should become vigilantes.
Yeah, that's it. Vigilantes.

570
00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:08.659
Wake up, men!
We need you. Now!

571
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.539
Come on.

572
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.819
What's going on? Where are we going?
Why are we here? What's happening?

573
00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.819
You're here because you're ready.
You said you were ready.

574
00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:21.179
- One thing I...
- You're ready, now.

575
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.939
Could you be a little more specific
concerning our current mission?

576
00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:39.779
- We're apprehending two known felons.
- I'll be going home now.

577
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.378
- Where are the rest?
- What rest? We're it.

578
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:09.299
- We'll flush them out of the building.
- You stay behind, cut them off in alley.

579
00:48:09.499 --> 00:48:10.499
Stay.

580
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.219
What about guns and shit, man?

581
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.739
Guns?
No, you won't be needing them.

582
00:48:15.939 --> 00:48:18.339
We're pretty sure
they're not armed.

583
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.538
They can handle this without us.
We'll just get in the way, you know.

584
00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.778
Good thinking.

585
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.619
We got them, men!

586
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.819
It's all right, men.
Come on over.

587
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.738
All right, you three will be
riding in the back with Badula...

588
00:49:24.379 --> 00:49:26.099
and his late brother.

589
00:49:32.059 --> 00:49:34.019
You guys keep him subdued.

590
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.698
Let's go.

591
00:50:04.539 --> 00:50:06.979
Don't let his voodoo
mumbo jumbo scare you.

592
00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:20.699
Fools. To think they can
kill the brother of Badula.

593
00:50:20.899 --> 00:50:22.579
I never thought that.

594
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.138
That I could reach into the belly
of a yak and rip out his heart.

595
00:50:28.699 --> 00:50:31.099
That would bring him
back to life?

596
00:50:31.299 --> 00:50:33.458
No, man. I'm hungry.

597
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.858
Listen, we're going for some burgers
and fries. We'll be right back.

598
00:51:20.379 --> 00:51:21.819
Out of my way!

599
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.899
I guess they weren't as ready
as they thought they were.

600
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.498
You can take the mask
off now, Tack.

601
00:51:46.299 --> 00:51:47.779
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir?

602
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:51.538
- Who are all these people?
- They're here for the party, sir.

603
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.298
What party?

604
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.619
A few of Citizens On Patrol members
invited a few of their friends...

605
00:51:57.819 --> 00:52:01.258
and they invited a few of their
friends, you know how it goes, sir.

606
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.058
- A party?
- Yes, sir.

607
00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:06.898
A party?
Why wasn't I told?

608
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.299
- Mahoney.
- Hey, Callahan.

609
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:13.738
Here you go.

610
00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.419
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

611
00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:19.419
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

612
00:52:19.619 --> 00:52:21.739
I'd like to thank you all
for coming!

613
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.539
Let's party!

614
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.978
- Move those patooties.
- Excuse me.

615
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.699
All police officers
out of the pool!

616
00:52:37.859 --> 00:52:40.659
- Proctor!
- Let's go! Out, everybody out!

617
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.699
Sir, why don't you just
let everyone enjoy themselves?

618
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:47.139
Why don't you just kiss
my rosy red ass, Mahoney?

619
00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.378
Rosy?

620
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.779
Get out of that pool now!

621
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.419
Just look at yourself.

622
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:04.819
You are a disgrace to the uniform!
Go get changed. Move it, move it!

623
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.779
- What are we looking for?
- This.

624
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.139
- Why, Capt. Harris.
- Miss Mattson.

625
00:53:22.339 --> 00:53:23.698
- Hello.
- How are you?

626
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.219
Have you seen Clarence?

627
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.819
Don't you let that
fleabag near me.

628
00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:31.859
Clarence is crazy
about you, Captain.

629
00:53:32.019 --> 00:53:33.379
Let me just call him over.

630
00:53:33.579 --> 00:53:34.859
- No.
- For a second?

631
00:53:35.059 --> 00:53:37.619
- No.
- Okay. Bye.

632
00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:48.019
Wipe those grins off your faces,
buttbreaths! Dismissed!

633
00:53:56.339 --> 00:53:58.898
Dr. Berman,
please pick up line two.

634
00:53:59.059 --> 00:54:00.418
Dr. Berman, line two, please.

635
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.298
- You shouldn't be in here.
- How is Capt. Harris?

636
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.898
- We'll do all we can.
- Please, be gentle.

637
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.058
I heard what Harris said,
and he's wrong.

638
00:54:26.739 --> 00:54:28.779
It happens to me all the time.

639
00:54:28.939 --> 00:54:30.578
People just don't understand me.

640
00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.299
Maybe if you talked a little slower,
a little softer...

641
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.419
That's not what I meant. I meant
people don't know who I really am.

642
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.938
Now I got to worry
about my diction too?

643
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.258
- How's my sentence structure?
- Perfect.

644
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.698
In fact,
I think you're just about perfect.

645
00:56:02.219 --> 00:56:04.339
I think I'm going to puke.

646
00:56:10.859 --> 00:56:13.298
Hi, sir.
How are you feeling?

647
00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:16.618
I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

648
00:56:18.659 --> 00:56:20.178
I didn't catch that.

649
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.898
Was that,
the dim shoe to snare off?

650
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:28.059
I said I have to wait
for the damn glue to wear off.

651
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.418
So I asked her,
do you always work under podiums?

652
00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.099
Commandant?

653
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:52.298
Why, Chief Hurst,
this is a splendid, splendid surprise!

654
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.978
You remember Nogata?
He's part of our Japanese contingent.

655
00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.819
This is Chief Hurst.

656
00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.538
We have heard many, many wonderful
things about you and your city.

657
00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.418
I've been helping them
with their English.

658
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.819
- Please, sit. Please.
- Thank you.

659
00:57:10.499 --> 00:57:14.939
I hope you'll find the time to
see our beautiful city firsthand.

660
00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:18.618
In fact,
I've just flown here personally...

661
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.938
to extend the mayor's invitation...

662
00:57:21.339 --> 00:57:22.738
to see my...

663
00:57:23.379 --> 00:57:27.938
To see Comdt. Lassard's
community program in action.

664
00:57:28.339 --> 00:57:31.139
We are convinced
that this program will serve...

665
00:57:31.339 --> 00:57:34.538
as a model for cities
around the world.

666
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.499
We would be honored
to accept your invitation.

667
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.979
- Wonderful.
- Oh, please, come.

668
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.379
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Arrivederci.

669
00:57:53.059 --> 00:57:54.258
Bonsoir.

670
00:57:57.699 --> 00:58:00.899
I see you've been teaching them
something other than English.

671
00:58:01.099 --> 00:58:02.498
I do what I can.

672
00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.979
- So my program is really working?
- Hell, yes.

673
00:58:06.579 --> 00:58:11.299
Starting tomorrow,
C.O.P.s will be working the streets.

674
00:58:27.179 --> 00:58:29.098
C.O.P. emergency.
Feldman here.

675
00:58:29.259 --> 00:58:32.098
Meet me at the corner of
Clark and Main Street at the warehouse.

676
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.259
10-4, Mrs. F.

677
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:47.659
- $40, we're agreed?
- Okay, $40.

678
00:58:48.459 --> 00:58:51.298
Snap off a few shots
for evidence.

679
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.539
Get closer.

680
00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.779
I saw this on Hill Street Blues.
It's a fencing operation.

681
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.099
You're gonna love these.
We just unloaded a van full of them.

682
00:59:05.299 --> 00:59:06.698
Okay, bring in the rest of it.

683
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.139
Next case.

684
00:59:13.779 --> 00:59:17.179
Nice camera. Don't let that
crook give you less than $80.

685
00:59:22.179 --> 00:59:24.498
Freeze, you scuzzbuckets!

686
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.538
This is a citizen's arrest.
Get them, boys!

687
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.619
You're not moving till
the cops get here.

688
00:59:45.379 --> 00:59:47.018
I am the cops, lady.

689
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:52.458
Three months' work
out the window, down the drain.

690
00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:55.618
Your Citizens On Patrol
just screwed up...

691
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.618
the single biggest
undercover police sting operation...

692
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.338
in the history of this city!

693
01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.178
Tell them the good news, sir.

694
01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:08.818
- Thank you, Proctor.
- You're welcome, sir.

695
01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:14.219
As of now,
the C.O.P. program is suspended...

696
01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:16.979
pending a full investigation.

697
01:00:21.979 --> 01:00:23.579
Ten-hut!

698
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.939
Mahoney, I'm so, so proud
of the job you've done.

699
01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:39.619
Nice work, men.

700
01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:42.619
The eyes of the world
are on this program.

701
01:00:42.819 --> 01:00:45.899
Excuse me, sir.
I think we should talk.

702
01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.978
This precinct must deal with
every type of criminal...

703
01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.538
from pickpockets to armed robbers,
felons of all kinds...

704
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.619
Capt. Harris. Excuse me.
Don't forget the gang of ninjas.

705
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.099
They're my personal favorites.

706
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.819
Why don't you go pay
them a visit?

707
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:16.179
This precinct is run
on discipline and organization.

708
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.379
Simon says, pull your left ear.

709
01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:24.778
Simon says, hop on your left foot.
Come on, guys.

710
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.219
Simon says,
hop on your right foot.

711
01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:33.258
It's a little too noisy
in here, gentlemen.

712
01:01:33.419 --> 01:01:35.458
We have important
police officials visiting...

713
01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:38.019
and I think you'd better show
the proper respect.

714
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.059
Ah, come on, Lieutenant.
We're almost finished.

715
01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:43.138
Come on, lieutenant, join us
in a friendly game of Simon Says.

716
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.779
There's nothing to it.
Now, Simon says, touch your toes.

717
01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:52.058
Come on, lieutenant.
Simon says, clap your hands.

718
01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:55.579
Come on, get in the spirit.

719
01:01:57.419 --> 01:01:59.979
Simon says, two steps right.

720
01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:04.859
Simon says, five steps back.

721
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.018
Put your hands up!

722
01:02:10.179 --> 01:02:12.419
Simon didn't say.

723
01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:14.698
No, but Smith & Wesson does.

724
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.098
The high-security cell area
is used to hold criminals...

725
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.058
awaiting trial or transfer
to state or county facilities.

726
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.699
Any convictions involving
felons...

727
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.618
perverts, thieves, people of that
nature, are held in this area.

728
01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:35.378
- You will notice the steel construction.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

729
01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:41.138
I think that explains it, sir.

730
01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.178
Come on, hurry up!

731
01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.779
<i>It's getting to the point now</i>

732
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.258
<i>When I'm with you</i>

733
01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.418
<i>I no longer want to have
something stuck in my eye</i>

734
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:17.419
<i>Your mother, my mother ain't never
looked like Florence Henderson</i>

735
01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.739
I wrote that for you.

736
01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.218
Oh, Zed.

737
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.339
I hope now that C.O.P. is over...

738
01:03:30.539 --> 01:03:33.219
it won't mean that we won't
be seeing each other anymore.

739
01:03:33.419 --> 01:03:34.378
Shut up!

740
01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:36.818
Not you.
I meant the ducks.

741
01:03:37.099 --> 01:03:38.819
Attention.
This is Mrs. F.

742
01:03:39.019 --> 01:03:42.858
- There's been a jailbreak.
- Zed, 10-4!

743
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.659
Tack, you pick me up
at Main and Maple.

744
01:03:46.059 --> 01:03:48.019
Move it! Over and out.

745
01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:50.379
Commandant!

746
01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:54.219
Commandant! Commandant!

747
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.739
- There's been a jailbreak, sir.
- Get in.

748
01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:12.019
- It's so wonderful to see you, baby.
- It's wonderful to be seen.

749
01:04:12.339 --> 01:04:16.819
- Just like old times.
- In America, talk is cheap.

750
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.178
There's been a jailbreak!

751
01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.978
Look, there's a stolen police car.
That's got to be it.

752
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.819
I think we got a robbery
in progress.

753
01:04:46.379 --> 01:04:48.259
Stay here, Mrs. Feldman.

754
01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.458
Freeze!

755
01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.779
Good idea.

756
01:05:05.699 --> 01:05:08.978
All right, I want everybody
to get back in that vault.

757
01:05:15.859 --> 01:05:18.578
Book them, Tack.

758
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.099
- There's a ninja now.
- I see him.

759
01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:28.659
Come on, let's get him.
Let's go.

760
01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.698
Do you see him?

761
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.539
Oh, shit.

762
01:06:00.299 --> 01:06:03.698
All right. If it's a fight you want,
a fight you'll get.

763
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.539
Damn you.
You're gonna pay for that.

764
01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:06.459
Yo!

765
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.659
<i>Nobody knows my sorrow</i>

766
01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.578
Shut up!

767
01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.458
Will you two morons knock it off!

768
01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.338
We've got an international incident
going on here!

769
01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.059
- I knew you'd come.
- Ja, danke.

770
01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:37.459
- You may thank Mrs. Feldman.
- Who is Mrs. Feldman?

771
01:07:37.659 --> 01:07:40.899
You know Mrs. Feldman,
a member of the defunct C.O.P. team.

772
01:07:47.659 --> 01:07:50.099
This is Sgt. Mahoney
in pursuit of a stolen police car.

773
01:07:50.259 --> 01:07:52.338
I'm headed towards
the Williams County air show.

774
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.539
Repeat, I'm pursing four escapees
toward the Williams County air show.

775
01:07:57.019 --> 01:07:59.458
Now, folks,
making his second appearance...

776
01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:02.539
at the Williams County air show...

777
01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.019
Hey, hey, hey!

778
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.499
- Look out for that car!
- What car?

779
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.939
That car! Come on, get out!

780
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.978
Come on!

781
01:08:22.259 --> 01:08:23.939
Let's get out of here!

782
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.099
Hurry up!

783
01:09:14.619 --> 01:09:17.979
This is where I draw the line.
I'm not going up in one of those things.

784
01:09:18.179 --> 01:09:21.058
- No way. No, sirree.
- You don't have to.

785
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.099
Hey!

786
01:09:43.699 --> 01:09:45.659
You can open your eyes now.

787
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.658
How can you like this
better than my driving?

788
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.019
Because you can't do this
in a car.

789
01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.258
Grab that balloon!

790
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.339
We commandeer this balloon
in the name of the law!

791
01:10:14.539 --> 01:10:18.098
- No, wait, you can't!
- We need it for the race.

792
01:10:28.539 --> 01:10:32.979
Mrs. Feldman, stay with the car.
Zed, Sweetchuck, follow me.

793
01:10:35.379 --> 01:10:38.459
Guys, wait up!
Tackleberry.

794
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.939
- What do I pull?
- Take it up!

795
01:10:41.139 --> 01:10:44.419
- They're getting away! Let's go!
- We are going up, sir.

796
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.099
Come on!
Drop the parachute!

797
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:56.498
Stop screwing around!

798
01:10:57.339 --> 01:11:00.299
- Come on! Drop the parachute!
- Come on!

799
01:11:00.499 --> 01:11:03.019
If he doesn't want to do it,
don't push him.

800
01:11:03.219 --> 01:11:05.418
He's gotta, like,
wanna help himself.

801
01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.579
You land that balloon right now!

802
01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:18.019
This is Capt. Harris!
You are under arrest!

803
01:11:18.219 --> 01:11:20.859
Land that balloon now!

804
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.739
- I'll just blast them out of the sky, sir.
- No! Not yet.

805
01:11:27.259 --> 01:11:30.579
You're right.
I should give them a warning shot first.

806
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.579
Imbecile!
Are you happy now?

807
01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.539
At least it looks like
we're coming down in the river.

808
01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:45.098
It won't matter
because you're going to be dead!

809
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.418
Pretty view...

810
01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:53.339
I hate water!

811
01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.938
Help!

812
01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.658
Help!

813
01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:06.099
- They're in the river.
- Hurry. Maybe we can catch them.

814
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.179
I'll pull alongside Tackleberry.

815
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.498
Look, I see my house!

816
01:12:20.059 --> 01:12:21.659
Look, the crooks!

817
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.739
Let's go get them, okay?

818
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.019
Hang on, sir!

819
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.259
- Hurry, before they go over the falls!
- There they go!

820
01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.738
Get a rope!

821
01:12:52.819 --> 01:12:54.618
Hang on. Hang on, sir!

822
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.378
Hang on,
we'll come and get you!

823
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.699
Grab it!

824
01:13:28.059 --> 01:13:29.458
Try to relax!

825
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.538
There's the balloon!
Now I've got them.

826
01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.779
There's only one way to do this
and it's up to me!

827
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.698
- Take over!
- He was talking to you!

828
01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.059
If you're coming back,
bring some beer!

829
01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:19.658
- No. He was talking to you.
- No, I heard him.

830
01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:24.099
- He said, Sweetchuck, take over.
- No, he did not.

831
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.299
- Get off of my foot!
- Shut up! Why are you always whining?

832
01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.258
Leave me alone!

833
01:15:01.459 --> 01:15:05.018
Gentlemen, may I see your license
and registration, please?

834
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.619
There they are. Take it down.
I want to get close. Get closer.

835
01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:17.819
Mahoney, what are you doing?

836
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.698
Get in closer!

837
01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.459
What do you think you're doing?

838
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.059
I'll take care of you, copper!

839
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.658
Get off my wing!
Get off of there!

840
01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.858
What will you do about them?

841
01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.899
Pal, it's over.
Let's go home.

842
01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.979
- I hate you.
- I'm not really thrilled about you!

843
01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:07.459
- Why don't you lose some weight?
- Why don't you get out and walk?

844
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.298
- I'm going to be sick!
- I don't have a parachute!

845
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.339
- Shut up! I'm going to be sick!
- Don't be sick on me!

846
01:16:27.579 --> 01:16:30.379
- I don't have a chute!
- Break your fall!

847
01:16:30.579 --> 01:16:33.659
- Hit the kids!
- No, I need a chute!

848
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.658
Get your own!
Get away from me!

849
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.379
Come on!

850
01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.498
Let go!

851
01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.418
I'll break you in half,
you dweeb.

852
01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.899
There, I opened the chute.
Are you satisfied? Leave me alone!

853
01:16:51.739 --> 01:16:55.018
- I'm going to kill you!
- Shut up and enjoy the flight!

854
01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.098
Get off me!

855
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.659
Commandant, they say
your Citizens On Patrol group...

856
01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:19.779
does many, many
wonderful and crazy things.

857
01:17:28.099 --> 01:17:31.739
I think Sgt. Mahoney
deserves a special bow.

858
01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.818
- Mahoney?
- All right!

859
01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.539
Mahoney?

860
01:17:37.099 --> 01:17:38.618
Mahoney!

861
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:45.659
Mahoney.

862
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.619
Get up!
Look, it's Mahoney!

863
01:17:47.819 --> 01:17:49.539
- Where?
- Sorry.

864
01:17:54.259 --> 01:17:56.499
- To the Academy.
- To the Academy.

865
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.058
You know, you look a little
like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.

866
01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:07.939
- Yeah?
- No!
