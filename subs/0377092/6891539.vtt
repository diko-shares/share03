-No, thank you.
-Good. So it's settled.

-I used to be home-schooled.

-My mom taught me at home...
-No, no.

I know what home-school is.
I'm not retarded.

218
00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:56.156
So you've actually never been
to a real school before?

-Home-schooled.

-My mom made it for me.

-It's adorable.
-It's so fetch.

229
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.685
-What is "fetch"?
-It's, like, slang from England.

230
00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:27.813
So if you're from Africa,
why are you white?

231
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:31.900
Oh, my God, Karen, you can't just ask
people why they're white.

232
00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:34.528
Could you give us some privacy for,
like, one second?

233
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.196
Yeah, sure.

234
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.449
What are you doing?

235
00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:44.913
Okay, you should just know
that we don't do this a lot,

236
00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:47.040
so this is, like, a really huge deal.

-Coolness.

240
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.923
So we'll see you tomorrow.

Oh, my God!
Okay, you have to do it, okay?

243
00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.472
And then you have to tell me
all the horrible things that Regina says.

244
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.641
Regina seems sweet.

245
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.226
Regina George is not sweet.

246
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.313
She's a scum-sucking road whore!
She ruined my life!

247
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.647
She's fabulous, but she's evil.

248
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.816
-Hey, get out of here!
-Oh, my God, Danny DeVito.

249

I love your work!

250
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.195
-Why do you hate her?
-What do you mean?

251
00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.323
Regina. You seem to really hate her.

252
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.991
Yes. What's your question?

253
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.493
-Well, my question is, why?
-Regina started this rumor

254
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:26.580
-that Janis was...
-Damian! Shall we not?

255
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.457
Now, look,
this isn't about hating her, okay?

256
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.500
I just think that it would be, like,
a fun little experiment

257
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.295
if you were to hang out with them
and then tell us everything that they say.

258
00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.547
-What do we even talk about?
-Hair products.

259

-Ashton Kutcher.
-Is that a band?

260
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.885
Would you just do it? Please?

261
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.221
Okay, fine. Do you have anything pink?

262
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:44.681
-Yes.
-No.

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.105

-Were people nice?

286
00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.451
<i>And Girl World had a lot of rules.</i>

287
00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:48.537
You can't wear a tank top two days
in a row,

288
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.790
and you can only wear your hair
in a ponytail once a week.

289
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.167
So I guess you picked today.

290
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.671
And we only wear jeans
or track pants on Fridays.

291
00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:01.174
Now, if you break any of these rules,
you can't sit with us at lunch.

292
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.552
Well, I mean, not just you.
Like, any of us.

293
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.595
Okay, like, if I was wearing jeans today,

294
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.932
I would be sitting over there
with the art freaks.

295
00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.644
And we always vote before we ask
someone to eat lunch with us,

296
00:14:12.728 --> 00:14:15.647
because you have to be considerate of
the rest of the group.

297
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:17.858
I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt
without asking your friends first

298
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.360
-if it looks good on you.
-I wouldn't?

299
00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:22.529
Right. And it's the same with guys.

300
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:26.616
Like, you may think you like someone,
but you could be wrong.

301
00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:30.454
120 calories and 48 calories from fat.
What percent is that?

302
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:32.706
Forty-eight into 120?

303
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.167
I'm only eating foods with less than
30% calories from fat.

304
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.127
It's 40%.

305
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.630
Well, 48 over 120 equals X over 100,

306
00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.925
and then you cross-multiply
and get the value of X.

307
00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:46.762
Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.

308
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.100

that you think are cute yet?

309

Well, there's this guy
in my calculus class...

-It's a senior?

Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels.

That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.

314
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.237
They went out for a year.

315
00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:07.532
Yeah, and then she was devastated
when he broke up with her last summer.

316
00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:09.367
I thought she dumped him
for Shane Oman.

317
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.662
Okay, irregardless. Ex-boyfriends
are just off-limits to friends.

318
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:16.041
I mean, that's just, like,
the rules of feminism.

319

00:32:52.388 --> 00:32:55.307
-Hey.
-Why were you talking to Janis Ian?

677
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:56.934
I don't know. I mean, she's so weird.

678
00:32:57.017 --> 00:33:00.604
She just, you know, came up to me
and started talking to me about crack.

679
00:33:00.688 --> 00:33:02.481
She's so pathetic.

680
00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:04.608
Let me tell you something
about Janis Ian.

681
00:33:04.692 --> 00:33:06.652
We were best friends in middle school.

682
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:08.737
I know, right? It's so embarrassing.

683
00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:10.906
I don't even... Whatever.

684
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.951
So then in eighth grade, I started
going out with my first boyfriend, Kyle,

685
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:16.871
who was totally gorgeous,
but then he moved to Indiana.

686
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:19.331
And Janis was, like,
weirdly jealous of him.

687
00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:21.834
Like, if I would blow her off
to hang out with Kyle,

688
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:23.961
she'd be like,
"Why didn't you call me back?"

689
00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:27.131
And I'd be like,
"Why are you so obsessed with me?"

690
00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:30.134
So then, for my birthday party,
which was an all-girls pool party,

691
00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:34.346
I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you,
because I think you're a lesbian."

692
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.682
I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian
at my party.

693
00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:39.143
There are gonna be girls there
in their bathing suits.

694
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:40.936
I mean, right? She was a lesbian.

695
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.647
So then her mom called my mom
and started yelling at her.

696
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:45.191
It was so retarded.

697
00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:47.526
And then she dropped out of school
because no one would talk to her.

698
00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.361
When she came back in the fall
for high school,

699
00:33:49.445 --> 00:33:52.072
all of her hair was cut off
and she was totally weird,

700
00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:54.533
and now I guess she's on crack.

701
00:33:54.992 --> 00:33:58.537
Oh, my God! I love your skirt.
Where did you get it?

702
00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:01.207
It was my mom's in the '80s.

703
00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.584
Vintage. So adorable.

704
00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:04.960
Thanks.

705
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.131
That is the ugliest F-ing skirt
I've ever seen.

706
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:13.219
Oh, my God, I love your bracelet.
Where did you get it?

707
00:34:15.721 --> 00:34:17.431
So are you gonna send
any candy canes?

708
00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:20.351
No. I don't send them. I just get them.

709
00:34:20.434 --> 00:34:22.895
So you better send me one, byotch.

710
00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:24.313

711
00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:26.982

715

and a wide-set vagina.

There has to be something that
you can say to these young ladies,

1387
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.399
something to help them
with their self-esteem.

1388
01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:36.733
It's not a self-esteem problem.

1389

with themselves.

And this time, I want you to raise
your hand if you have ever

1397

behind her back.

Okay. Good.

Can I just say that we don't have
a clique problem at this school?

1416
01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:03.820
And some of us shouldn't have
to take this workshop,

1417
01:12:03.904 --> 01:12:06.781
because some of us are just victims
in this situation.

1418
01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.158
That's probably true.

(SIGHS) So I have this friend
who is a new student this year,

1474
01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:15.387
and I convinced her that it would be fun
to mess up Regina George's life.

1475
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:17.847
So I had her pretend
to be friends with Regina,

1476
01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:19.391
and then she would
come to my house after

1477
01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:22.060
and we would just laugh about
all the dumb stuff Regina said.

1478
01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:26.189
And we gave her these candy bar things
that would make her gain weight,

1479
01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.817
and we turned
her best friends against her.

And then... Oh, yeah, Cady.
You know my friend Cady.

and then convinced him
to break up with her.

instead of face wash.

Really, I don't know why I did it.
