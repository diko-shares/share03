1
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.760
OK, I've got another one.
A good one.

2
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.430
A man and a woman
are making love one night...

3
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.600
when their young boy walks in.

4
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.470
Wait a minute.
Is this the right way?

5
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.850
Olav!

6
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.270
What the hell are we looking for?

7
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.520
Just keep going straight.

8
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.530
We are getting close
to the source of the signal.

9
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.160
OK, carry on.

10
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.330
The boy is horrified.
He runs out of the room crying.

11
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.330
The mother says,
"Oh my God, what should we do?"

12
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.300
The father says, "I'll handle this."

13
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
He walks out the room.
Goes and opens his son's door...

14
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.970
And there is little Sven,
lying on top of Grandma.

15
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.390
Just giving her the business.

16
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.190
Going up and down. Up and down.

17
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.560
And the boy turns around
and looks at his father...

18
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.360
"Not so funny when it's your mom, is it?"

19
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.620
Stop!

20
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.250
We're close.

21
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.050
We're right on top of it.

22
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.280
Nobody move.

23
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.270
Oh my God!

24
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.880
Kate.

25
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.430
Shit.

26
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.760
Sorry, Kate. These fellas said that
you've been expecting them.

27
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.850
- Of course. Thanks, Hank.
- Thanks.

28
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.980
- You forgot, didn't you?
- No, no.

29
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.230
I just...

30
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.820
Yeah.

31
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.030
He just wanted to...
Actually, this is him. Okay.

32
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.700
I'm Dr. Sander Halvorson.

33
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.870
Kate Lloyd.

34
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.370
Yes. Do you know who I am?

35
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.370
I do.

36
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.040
Adam told me a little
bit about you as well.

37
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.710
He says you specialize
in vertebrate paleontology.

38
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.550
Primarily, yes.

39
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.010
And obviously you've
extracted specimens from pack ice.

40
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.550
I've worked on
several cold-weather digs.

41
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.600
Good.

42
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.900
An old friend of mine,
a colleague from Oslo,

43
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.900
runs a geological
research station in Antarctica.

44
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.070
Forty-eight hours ago,
his team found something

45
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.950
quite remarkable.

46
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.200
Really?

47
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.160
What'd they find?

48
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.370
We're flying down there
tomorrow evening to examine the site

49
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.080
and I need a paleontologist.

50
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.750
Doctor, I'm sure you can understand
that I need to know a little bit

51
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.800
about what it is I'm
being asked to dig up.

52
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.420
- There's a structure.
- A structure?

53
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.050
- Yes.
- In Antarctica?

54
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.550
And a specimen.

55
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.100
That's all I can tell you.

56
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.980
And I guess I don't have any time
to think about this?

57
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.380
No, I'm sorry.
I need your answer right now.

58
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.780
Well...

59
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.490
I'm in.

60
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.830
Great.

61
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.160
Adam will get you the details
of our departure.

62
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.920
- I'll see you in the car.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

63
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.250
Adam.

64
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.470
What the hell is it?

65
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.800
You now officially
know as much as I do.

66
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.140
But I'll tell you one thing. I have
worked for that guy for three years

67
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.710
and I have never
seen him this excited.

68
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.350
- She U.S.?
- Mmm-hmm.

69
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.190
Look at this guy.

70
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.860
How is that even humanly possible?

71
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.380
I was hoping maybe you could help me
with something.

72
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.090
I can't seem to get a hold of
a newspaper that's not, you know,

73
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.300
three weeks old, and I'm a man in
desperate need of certain information.

74
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.930
Carter, don't do
this to yourself, man.

75
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.730
And what information would that be?

76
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.230
I wanna know how
the Cavaliers are doing.

77
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.070
Hmm. I don't follow football.

78
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.940
It's a basketball team.

79
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.070
- They play basketball.
- Barely.

80
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.410
They're the Cavaliers, man.

81
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.450
- Sorry I couldn't help you.
- That's all right.

82
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.710
Hey, listen, so you guys know,
whatever you all are doing,

83
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.920
you might wanna wrap it up
in a couple of days.

84
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.460
- Yeah? Why's that?
- There's a storm moving in.

85
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.630
- A nasty one.
- Good morning, Griggs.

86
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.010
Yeah, he's right.
And the last place that you wanna be

87
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.810
is cooped up with
a dozen Norwegian guys.

88
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.810
Trust me.

89
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.320
<i>Base in sight at my one o'clock.</i>

90
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.120
<i>This is H3 Sea King inbound for Thule.
Do you copy?</i>

91
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.170
<i>Hello, H3 Sea King.
Please approach from the west.</i>

92
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.000
<i>That path is clear.</i>

93
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.310
<i>Throttle coming back.</i>

94
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.690
Good to go, Griggs.

95
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.240
- Dr. Halvorson?
- Yes.

96
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.820
- Welcome to Thule.
- Thank you.

97
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.370
Edvard asked you to go
to the site right now.

98
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.160
Lars is gonna drive you.

99
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.500
- Hi.
- Hi, welcome.

100
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.540
- Please go in the Spryte.
- Thanks.

101
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.230
Watch your step.

102
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.610
...Polet...

103
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.530
Edvard!

104
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.410
- You made it!
- Of course I did.

105
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.950
Yeah, this is Kate Lloyd.

106
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.580
Columbia paleontology. Welcome.

107
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.790
- Adam Finch, my research assistant.
- Welcome. Hi.

108
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.570
This is Edvard, my good friend.

109
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.510
This is some of my team.
This is Karl and Juliette.

110
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.340
- Both geologists.
- Hi. Welcome.

111
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.050
Okay.

112
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.430
Let me show you why you flew
10,000 miles.

113
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.180
Holy shit.

114
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.110
We estimate it's been here
approximately 100,000 years.

115
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.610
We picked up a signal transmitting.

116
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.900
Some kind of distress call, perhaps.

117
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.320
Incredible.

118
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.370
We think the signal got triggered
when the survivor exited the craft.

119
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.830
Survivor?

120
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.650
My God.

121
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.590
How long will it take to get out?
Do you know, Kate?

122
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.720
Assuming you have
the right equipment, I'd say,

123
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.230
maybe a half a day.

124
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.480
Good.

125
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.460
Uh, the ice, I should ask you,
how fragile is it?

126
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.000
It's not in the fracture zone, so
there's very little risk of fissuring.

127
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.880
And the ice is quite dense, so we
think we can get it out in one piece.

128
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.050
Good.

129
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.810
A rough estimate is about six by
12 feet, three and a half feet high.

130
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.440
Probably someplace around
three and a half...

131
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.100
That's good. Make sure that
everyone stays off the radio.

132
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.810
We don't want any information out.

133
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.610
And the crane, do we have something
that's appropriate for this?

134
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.530
Yeah, it's already there.
It's all set up.

135
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.070
I'm Peder, by the way.

136
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.780
- Peder.
- Nice to meet you.

137
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.220
So you've got it all taken care of.
I don't think you really need me.

138
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.250
What about him?
Is he completely disinterested or...

139
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.960
Oh, that's Lars.

140
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.540
He doesn't understand English,
but he'll work like a bear.

141
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.380
And as you can see from the scans,

142
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.970
the ship carved a 200-meter tunnel
into the ice.

143
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.130
Wow.

144
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.590
So let me get this right.

145
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.800
You crash into a glacier,

146
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.600
and then without enough information,

147
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.810
you leave the cozy
confines of your ship?

148
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.190
Maybe it was hurt and wanted to
find someplace warm.

149
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.230
I guess it didn't find it.

150
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.780
The first night is hard.

151
00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.550
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to keep you up.

152
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.750
No, no, it's fine.

153
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.720
We'll never look at
them the same again.

154
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.710
93 pounds... complete pounds,
about 1,190. Yeah.

155
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.820
What do you need for
a transport weight?

156
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.490
To cut it down to a portable weight,

157
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.670
we'll have to take
it from here to here.

158
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.510
Start with four inches or so.

159
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.180
I never believed in this shit.

160
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.680
I always did.

161
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.140
We all set?

162
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.850
Nearly there.

163
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.190
Good.

164
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.230
Good.

165
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.140
But before we do,
I'm going to take a tissue sample.

166
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.780
Do you really think
that's a good idea?

167
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.370
Yes, I do.

168
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.690
The conditions are so unpredictable

169
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.130
and we don't have the proper equipment.
Sterilization is an issue.

170
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.930
Edvard, what do you have in the way
of a small diameter drill?

171
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.220
Up to 30 millimeters.

172
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.060
Very good.

173
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.720
I think somewhere around here.

174
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.270
Kate.

175
00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.690
Just a second.

176
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.530
In the future, don't contradict me
in front of those people again.

177
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.990
- I just thought I'd...
- You're not here to think.

178
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.410
You're here to get this thing
safely out of the ice.

179
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.750
I hope we understand each other.

180
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.220
Here you are.

181
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.640
- So, have you ever tasted this before?
- No, I haven't. It tastes very bad.

182
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.290
Gentlemen, ladies.

183
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:18.040
After a short but thorough
investigation of our visitor,

184
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.810
I can say, unequivocally,

185
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.510
that I have never seen
anything on any cellular level

186
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.720
like what we have in that other room.

187
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.100
And the impact of this find
will be felt for thousands of years.

188
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.490
From this point on,

189
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.810
the world as we know it
has forever been altered.

190
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.400
You, my friends,
will all be immortalized

191
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.990
as the people who made this discovery.

192
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.740
We found a fucking alien!

193
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.700
Cheers!

194
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.770
Thank you.

195
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.170
You think they're gonna pay a bonus
for bringing home an alien

196
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.280
instead of core samples?

197
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.190
You got anything better
than this cough syrup?

198
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.140
- Hey, Griggsey.
- Yeah?

199
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.440
You wanna go out
and get the captain's stash?

200
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.980
Sure. No problem.

201
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.670
I'm on it.

202
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.270
Where'd I put those bottles?

203
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.040
Screw you, man.

204
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.050
Son of a bitch.

205
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.700
It broke out!

206
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.140
Cuckoo!

207
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.530
It ain't a damn joke, man!
The frigging thing's alive!

208
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.470
I was in the room, man,
looking at the ice,

209
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.230
the frigging thing jumped out!

210
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.560
We will search in groups of
two and three.

211
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.040
The entire camp.

212
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.500
If you find it, call out.
Don't attempt anything on your own.

213
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.170
And be careful.
We don't know what condition it's in.

214
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.800
There's nothing here.

215
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.890
Let's check over there.

216
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.600
Griggs.

217
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.590
You leave that open?

218
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.550
I don't remember.

219
00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.690
Shit.

220
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.620
Hey, just be careful, man.

221
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.480
That thing jumped
through the fucking roof.

222
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.570
Lars' dog.

223
00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.640
Jesus Christ.

224
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.710
Did you hear that?

225
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.660
Be careful.

226
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.090
Let's go.

227
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.700
Oh my God.

228
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.300
Help! Over here!

229
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.540
Help!

230
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.060
Somebody!

231
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.860
Over here!

232
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.820
Where?

233
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.460
- It attacked Henrik!
- Come on!

234
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.870
In there!

235
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.330
Oh, God, somebody do something!

236
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.290
Shoot it! Shoot the fucker!

237
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.460
It killed Henrik.

238
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.280
No, no, no, no! We gotta burn
that fucker, man! Burn it!

239
00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.690
Throw it! Throw it!

240
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.480
His blood pressure is low.

241
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.230
Henrik had two small children.

242
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.870
Yes, it's horrible.
It was a horrible tragedy.

243
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.700
We are all shocked
at what happened to Henrik.

244
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.060
But with due respect,
we need to examine

245
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.760
the remains before
it all disintegrates.

246
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.340
- Hey, that was a man. Not remains.
- No, I'm talking about the creature.

247
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.840
And I'm sure we're all aware of
the importance of this discovery.

248
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.050
This may be the first
and only time mankind

249
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.620
has been visited by
an alien life form.

250
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.980
And as scientists,
we're obliged to study it.

251
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.940
Didn't work out so well
the last time, did it?

252
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.800
I think you should destroy it.

253
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.580
Completely.

254
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.700
I think you've contributed enough
to this endeavor.

255
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.260
Really?

256
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.980
Listen, your guy Olav back there,
he's in bad shape.

257
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.370
Now, we're gonna fly him
back to McMurdo at sun up

258
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.000
and take him to
the military hospital.

259
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.120
And what are you going to tell them?

260
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.470
I'm gonna tell them the truth,
as crazy as it sounds.

261
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.160
Edvard, we are running out of time.

262
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.110
Peder, Jonas, bring it inside.

263
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.640
Kate.

264
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.670
Can you help here?

265
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.360
Come on.

266
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.490
Pull that side open.

267
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.050
His face is encased
in some type of amniotic sac.

268
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.620
And the tissue looks almost new.

269
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.590
What was it doing to him?

270
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.630
It appears it was absorbing him.

271
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.650
Some type of digestion.

272
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.200
It's fascinating.

273
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.470
It is fascinating.

274
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.360
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

275
00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.870
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

276
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.970
- You need something?
- No, no. I'm okay.

277
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.780
What is this?

278
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:25.240
It looks like a titanium plate.

279
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.930
It's used to reinforce broken bones,
compound fractures.

280
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.770
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.520
Henrik broke his arm last year.

282
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.330
He had to go to Argentina
to get it set.

283
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.340
So if this was in his arm,
what's it doing out of him now?

284
00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.100
That's a good question.

285
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.970
What are you doing?

286
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.700
I took a sample of Henrik's tissue.

287
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.150
I want to find out
what this thing was doing to him.

288
00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.520
I think you should take a look
at this.

289
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.530
These cells aren't dead.

290
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.470
That's not possible.

291
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.990
It looks like
the alien cells are somehow

292
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.040
attacking Henrik's
cells and then they...

293
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.470
What is that?
It's like they're transforming into...

294
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.220
They're imitating his cells.

295
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.840
Okay, I don't know
if that's what I'm seeing, but...

296
00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.940
They're imitating him.

297
00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.050
- Place is giving me the creeps, man.
- No kidding.

298
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.160
We're getting out of here
not a moment too soon.

299
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.910
- Hey, yo, did you get that other thing?
- Yeah, all I could carry.

300
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.090
It's going to be okay, Olav.
A doctor will see you at McMurdo.

301
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.720
Okay.

302
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.190
Kate.

303
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.590
We're leaving.

304
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:58.370
If the weather holds up, we'll be back
with help as soon as we can.

305
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.270
Okay.

306
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.320
All right.

307
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.030
- Keep him warm.
- I will.

308
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.330
Come on, let's go.

309
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.290
Sit down there.

310
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.130
There you go.

311
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.640
Let's get the hell out of here.

312
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.940
Carter!

313
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.440
Carter, wait! Come on!

314
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.530
She's flagging us down.

315
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.760
- What's wrong?
- They shouldn't leave.

316
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.040
Carter.

317
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.270
Let's just get out of here, man.

318
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.790
- All right, fuck it. We're landing.
- Shit.

319
00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.970
Let's take her down.

320
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.370
Is there something wrong?

321
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.640
Uh... No, no, everything's fine.

322
00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.840
They probably just forgot something.

323
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.550
We'll be in the air in no time.
Okay?

324
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.340
Don't worry.

325
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.370
Hang in there.

326
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.840
Something's wrong.

327
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.990
Hailing McMurdo or any ears on
emergency channel, do you copy? Over.

328
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.060
I repeat, this is Thule Station.

329
00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.740
They crashed here,
right behind this ridgeline.

330
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.830
It's impossible to reach them.

331
00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.670
This doesn't make any sense.

332
00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.390
They had plenty of visibility, right?

333
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.980
We're not going after them?
Shouldn't we try?

334
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.980
We need our chopper
to even get close to them,

335
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.830
and that's refueling in Halley.

336
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.220
This can't be a coincidence.

337
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.350
Radio's dead. It's fucking dead.

338
00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.020
The incoming storm.

339
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.280
Shit.

340
00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.510
There's too much interference.

341
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.640
We just lost four people.
We have no helicopter or radio.

342
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.770
You are making a mistake
by bringing in outside help.

343
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.310
We could lose the discovery.

344
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.280
Sander, we are beyond that point now.

345
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.850
Colin, Lars, get your gear.

346
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.040
We'll take a snowcat
to the next base. Lars...

347
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.750
It's time to go.

348
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.230
I don't think that's a good idea.

349
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.320
And why is that?

350
00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.880
Because no one can leave this camp

351
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.880
until we know more
about what's going on here.

352
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.720
- I make decisions about this camp.
- I know, Edvard, but...

353
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.540
- Why did you flag down that helicopter?
- Because I thought it was in danger.

354
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.250
Why?

355
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.690
I took a sample of Henrik's blood.

356
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.800
And I saw that the alien
cells were still alive.

357
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.130
They were alive and they were
copying Henrik's cells.

358
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.440
Replicating them.

359
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.030
Adam saw it, too.

360
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.120
Is that true?

361
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.500
I don't know.
I don't know what we saw.

362
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.250
We saw something.

363
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.450
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

364
00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.800
That this thing
can and probably has

365
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.760
replicated a person.

366
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.060
Yeah. Okay, okay.
Kate, Kate.

367
00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.940
Okay. Kate.

368
00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:01.740
This is not the time
to be yelling 'Fire'.

369
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.780
Let's stop, gather our thoughts,
and discuss this in private.

370
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.030
We don't need any
private meetings, Doctor.

371
00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:12.470
- We all want the fucking information.
- There's more.

372
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.880
What are those?

373
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.490
I think they're fillings
from someone's teeth.

374
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.880
I found them by a puddle of
blood in the shower.

375
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.460
A puddle of blood?

376
00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.590
It can clone cells,
but not inorganic material.

377
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.710
It couldn't copy these,
so it spit them out.

378
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.280
We've wasted too much
time already. Lars...

379
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:33.810
Listen!

380
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.560
When I went back to check it,
someone had cleaned up the blood.

381
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.770
Someone had wiped it away.

382
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.940
All right?
So whatever it is,

383
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.880
it is still here.

384
00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.010
I've heard enough.

385
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.330
Lars, Colin, get your gear.
Ten minutes.

386
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.890
Please, Edvard. You can't leave.

387
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:07.200
You can't leave. You don't know
what we're dealing with.

388
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:11.970
Well done.

389
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.140
Kate.

390
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.190
I don't know if I should be
speaking about this.

391
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.110
I don't wanna get
anyone in trouble, but...

392
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.700
Speaking about what?

393
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.950
You were saying

394
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.740
about someone cleaning up the blood
from the shower,

395
00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:41.790
that someone here
may not be themselves?

396
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:43.640
Juliette, please.

397
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.640
What did you see?

398
00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:53.520
After the crash, I think I saw Colin
coming from the showers.

399
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.050
He was holding something.

400
00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.140
It could have been a towel or a rag,
something to clean up.

401
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.510
Kate, I can't say for sure,
but it's just the...

402
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.050
- He's leaving with Edvard.
- We can't let him go.

403
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.500
We can't let any of them go.

404
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.820
I know where they keep the keys
for the vehicles.

405
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.660
Okay.

406
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.730
- Where are they?
- In that drawer.

407
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.210
- This one?
- Yes.

408
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.570
- How many am I looking for?
- Five.

409
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.450
There's three and four.

410
00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.420
You said there were five?

411
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.150
Run!

412
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:53.840
- Kate, what happened?
- Karl! It got Karl! It got Karl!

413
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.440
Kate...

414
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.190
Burn it!

415
00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.850
That's enough. Get back.

416
00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.470
Burn in hell.

417
00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.090
What the fuck's happening to us?

418
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.930
It attacks its prey,

419
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.930
copies it perfectly,

420
00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.330
and then hides inside it,

421
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.650
waiting.

422
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.940
Is it still among us?

423
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.330
It could be any of us.

424
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:34.870
- We've gotta get out of here.
- Yeah. Right now.

425
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.070
Then you could be
getting in a vehicle with it.

426
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.790
You'd be alone.

427
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.100
Vulnerable.

428
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.720
That's exactly what it wants.

429
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.070
Not to mention you'd be giving it
a way out of here.

430
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.380
A way to spread.

431
00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.010
It's like a virus.

432
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.450
- So what do we do with any virus?
- Quarantine.

433
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:07.820
We isolate it and then we kill it.

434
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.630
Yeah.

435
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.500
We have to rely on science.

436
00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.000
Exposing our uncontaminated blood
to the cells of the creature

437
00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:20.580
might create
a reaction of some kind.

438
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.440
So we take blood
samples from everybody.

439
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:25.670
Yeah, and we test each one of them.

440
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.450
Yes. Adam and I can do that.

441
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.010
Okay.

442
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:37.020
Lars and I will disable the vehicles.

443
00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.980
We have to trust in this plan.

444
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:47.790
It's our only chance
of making it through this.

445
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.440
- Is that it?
- Yes. Done.

446
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:08.440
- No more vehicles?
- Finished.

447
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:10.030
Okay.

448
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:21.310
What?

449
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.170
Grenades.

450
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.730
Is everything all right?

451
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.560
Yes. Yes, everything's fine.

452
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:12.950
Good.

453
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.780
We have to get inside, Lars.

454
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.950
Kate, we should go.

455
00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.540
The storm is getting worse.

456
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.810
Who is that?

457
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.050
Hurry, they're coming!

458
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.090
The Americans.

459
00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:15.910
It's impossible for a human
to survive that crash.

460
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.650
We should burn them.
Right here, right now.

461
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.110
- It could be murder.
- It could be survival, Kate.

462
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.670
Yes, but we don't have
to kill them. All right?

463
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.130
We can just lock them up
until Sander's test is ready.

464
00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.030
Please.

465
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.230
Please.

466
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.760
So this is a good idea?

467
00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:40.550
Locking us up?

468
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.770
You need our help.

469
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.460
Don't move, demons!

470
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.270
Okay.

471
00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.700
Okay.

472
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.410
Kate.

473
00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:07.360
A bunch of scientists, they can't
handle what we saw in that chopper.

474
00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.540
For all we know,
you could be one of those things.

475
00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:14.380
It is pretty hard to believe you
both walked away from that crash.

476
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:18.510
- Yeah, I get that. I do, but...
- We're preparing a test..

477
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:22.290
and then we figure out who's who.

478
00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:25.360
It's all I can offer you right now.

479
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.460
Someone sabotaged it.
There's nothing left. Nothing.

480
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.540
Now there's no test.

481
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.010
- How could this happen?
- It was no accident.

482
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.810
You.

483
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.510
You were in there with it.
You were the last one.

484
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.680
- Why are you accusing me?
- Why not?

485
00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:53.140
- He's got something to hide.
- What are you, an asshole?

486
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:56.050
I was the one working on the test.
I left for two minutes!

487
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.020
You just don't want us
to know the truth, do ya?

488
00:59:58.110 --> 01:00:00.350
Bullshit! Don't tell me
to fucking calm down!

489
01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.600
- This is a goddamn fucking nightmare!
- There might be another way.

490
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.660
I think there might be

491
01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.250
another way to tell.

492
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.720
Peder, give me your flashlight.

493
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.480
- Now tell Lars to open his mouth.
- Huh?

494
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.900
Tell him to open his mouth.

495
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.250
Open your mouth.

496
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.040
Good.

497
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.580
Lars has fillings.

498
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.090
So he's human.
It can't imitate inorganic material.

499
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.130
See?

500
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.400
Good.

501
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.210
Open.

502
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.610
C'mon.

503
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.140
You're next.

504
01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.100
Okay.

505
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.230
Okay. Good.

506
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.640
Right now it's at least something.

507
01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:52.510
A way to eliminate some of us.

508
01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:54.870
So I'm gonna get killed
because I floss?

509
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.110
Nobody's getting killed.

510
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:58.730
Kate.

511
01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:03.150
- Open up, you weasel.
- Kate, come on. Kate.

512
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.020
Just do it.

513
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.220
Kate.

514
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.740
Open.

515
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:32.060
Just go stand over there.

516
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:48.740
You know as well as I do,
there are too many variables.

517
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.290
Open your mouth.

518
01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.340
Open your mouth!

519
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.640
They're porcelain.

520
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:08.810
Go stand by Adam.

521
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:17.310
Anyone else with porcelain fillings?
Or clean teeth?

522
01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:22.420
This is bloody absurd.

523
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:24.760
Open your mouth for God's sake!

524
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.280
This is wrong.

525
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.050
Jonas, you and Lars go out,

526
01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.470
get Carter and Jameson and bring
them in here. We'll check them, too.

527
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.680
But why don't we just leave them
where they are?

528
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.620
- They can't do anything.
- We need to know.

529
01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.520
- She wants us to get the Americans.
- Let's go then.

530
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.990
She's clever.

531
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.150
Yeah.

532
01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.460
And now she's in charge.

533
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.440
Shit.

534
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.930
They escaped.

535
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.180
Lars.

536
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.030
Let's go back inside.

537
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:01.660
We have to find them.

538
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.140
Lars, careful. They aren't human!

539
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.300
Wait!

540
01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.930
Lars!

541
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.820
Peder.

542
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.600
Take it easy!

543
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:32.690
The threat isn't in here.
It's out there.

544
01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:37.760
- The Americans are the real enemy.
- He's right, Peder.

545
01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.740
Whatever they're saying,
right now it doesn't matter.

546
01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.150
You can't trust them.

547
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.100
Watch them.

548
01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.640
Kate!

549
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.360
Come on!

550
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.030
Come on!

551
01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:06.950
- Where are they? Where are the rest?
- They attacked him!

552
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.710
- Who?
- They got Lars! Peder!

553
01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:12.320
They have Lars!

554
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.010
- What happened?
- Peder, keep them back.

555
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.510
- We have to help him!
- Stay on them, Peder!

556
01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.130
- Peder, they got Lars!
- The enemy is outside!

557
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.710
We don't know if we can trust them!

558
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.370
Stay on them! Stay on them, Peder!

559
01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:33.060
They're inside.

560
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.330
Where is Lars?

561
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:50.260
- Calm down!
- What have you done with Lars?

562
01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.920
- I said calm down!
- Where the fuck is Lars?

563
01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:54.770
Drop it.

564
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.200
- Somebody tell him!
- Peder, don't listen to him.

565
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.320
- Put it down!
- They killed Lars.

566
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.490
Burn them!

567
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:22.180
Peder. Peder.

568
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.460
Okay.

569
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.740
I just want to check my friend, okay?

570
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:32.490
It's okay.

571
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.940
He was gonna fire.

572
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.690
- It's going to ignite!
- It's gonna blow! Watch out!

573
01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:13.410
Edvard?

574
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.630
Edvard?

575
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.480
- Pick him up.
- Okay.

576
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.360
- Get down. Get down.
- You.

577
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.680
Yeah, you, help him!

578
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.110
All right, show yourselves.

579
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.530
Right fucking now!

580
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.650
Everybody in the rec room.

581
01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.760
Pick him up. Come on.

582
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.930
Sit down.

583
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.060
Not all of us are human.

584
01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.850
Just put him over there on the couch.

585
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.030
Get it off!

586
01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.730
What the fuck is this shit, man?

587
01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:03.980
Carter!
Carter, burn it, man!

588
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.980
There's something wrong with it!
Fuck!

589
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:09.920
God damn it, Carter, burn it!

590
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.710
Shit! Carter, table!

591
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.280
Carter!

592
01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.220
Something's wrong with the pressure.
It's got air in the pipe!

593
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.120
Watch out!

594
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.770
We gotta get the air out!

595
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.280
Burn it!

596
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:39.850
I'm with you, buddy.

597
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:28.640
Carter?

598
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.480
Are you okay?

599
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.490
Yeah.

600
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.670
Are you?

601
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.990
Not yet I'm not.

602
01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:48.710
We find it and we kill it.

603
01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.410
I think that was Sander.

604
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:03.470
Yeah.

605
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.480
- Gross.
- Oh, no! Get it!

606
01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.930
- You see it?
- Where'd it go?

607
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:34.840
There!

608
01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.290
Get back!

609
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:49.450
Don't. Don't touch it.

610
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.430
Did you hear that?

611
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:11.220
Yeah.

612
01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.040
Kate.

613
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.260
- Sander.
- Wait. So what?

614
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.570
- It'll freeze out there.
- And if it doesn't?

615
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:35.320
If it makes it out of here,
millions of people could die.

616
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:38.710
- It's got nowhere to go.
- Yes, it does.

617
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.940
Come on.

618
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:52.730
All right.

619
01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.500
What?

620
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:43.900
What happened to Lars?

621
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:47.320
We didn't kill him.

622
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.700
Come on.

623
01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.960
Run! Run!

624
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.650
Kate!

625
01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:40.460
Kate!

626
01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:07.260
Kate?

627
01:26:10.890 --> 01:26:12.570
Kate!

628
01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:29.590
Kate!

629
01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.590
So what do we do now?

630
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.940
There's a Russian station
about 50 miles from here.

631
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:54.140
We should have enough gas.

632
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:03.780
We're gonna make it back, okay?

633
01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:07.790
Okay.

634
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:28.930
Let's go.

635
01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.220
I'll put this in the back.

636
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:55.380
You know how I knew you were human
when you showed up back at base?

637
01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.260
No.

638
01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:03.670
Your earring.

639
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.590
It was your other ear.

640
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:29.580
Kate...
Kate, what are you doing?

641
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:32.500
Let's talk about this.

642
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:34.420
Talk to me.

643
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:35.710
Kate.

644
01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.360
Oh my God.

645
01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:15.990
Hello?

646
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.250
Hello, can anyone hear me?

647
01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.090
Edvard?

648
01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.180
Edvard?

649
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:36.760
Hello!

650
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.440
Hello!

651
01:36:58.290 --> 01:36:59.790
Lars!

652
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:03.830
- Lars, it's me damn it!
- Open your mouth!

653
01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:06.210
Open it now!

654
01:37:22.810 --> 01:37:24.850
That's no dog!

655
01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.690
Start the helicopter now!

656
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:37.750
Get it up now! Come on!
