Turns out she's a hematologist.

180
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.732
She might be useful to us.

181

Blade: I doubt it.

182

Whistler: I'm serious.

183
00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:59.326
I took a look at that notebook of hers.
She's on to something.

184
00:26:01.245 --> 00:26:02.705
I had to increase the dose.

185
00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:07.626
It's over 50 milligrams now.
That's getting dangerous.

186
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.172
Just do it, old man.

191
00:27:38.008 --> 00:27:39.802
So am I a prisoner here?

192
00:27:41.303 --> 00:27:43.305
Not at all.

193
00:27:43.388 --> 00:27:47.559
We just had to take certain precautions
before we let you go.

194

- And I'm supposed to believe all this?

201

Well, you already met Mr. Crispy
at the hospital.

What do you think?

203
00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:17.464
So, what do you use, then?
Stakes? Crosses?

204
00:28:17.548 --> 00:28:22.344
Crosses don't do squat.
Some of the legends are true, though.

205
00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:26.223
Vampires are severely allergic to silver.

206
00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:29.184
Feed them garlic
and they go into anaphylactic shock.

207

Then, of course, there's always sunlight,
ultraviolet rays.

If you wanna live to see another day,
you'll be out of town by nightfall.

212
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.461
So where am I supposed to go?

213
00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:02.801
You've been exposed to them.

214
00:29:03.051 --> 00:29:06.722
One way or another,
somebody's gonna take you out.

215

But sometimes, people like yourself
get caught in the crossfire.

I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

On the subway or in a bar.

224

Buy yourself a gun.

If you start getting sensitive
to daylight...

233
00:30:14.665 --> 00:30:19.670
If you find you're thirsty, regardless
of how much you've had to drink...

234
00:30:19.962 --> 00:30:24.049
Then I suggest you take that gun
and use it on yourself.

235
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:30.138

00:42:52.296 --> 00:42:55.340
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the entrance?

351
00:42:55.425 --> 00:43:00.555
Okay. Look, it's in the freezer.

352
00:43:09.647 --> 00:43:13.358
Come on, man, I told you!
It's in the fridge!

353
00:43:22.452 --> 00:43:25.038
- Okay.
- You give frost a message from me.

354
00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:28.833
You tell him it's open season
on all suck-heads.

355
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.377
Some kind of archive.

356
00:44:17.173 --> 00:44:19.675
This must be where
they keep most of their records.

357
00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:21.594
Karen: Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

358
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:25.973
They've got their claws into everything.
Politics, finance, real estate.

359
00:44:26.057 --> 00:44:29.185
They already own half of downtown.

[Chattering]

361
00:44:49.205 --> 00:44:52.667
- Man 1: Hey, how's it going?
- Man 2: I'm surprised they were there.

362
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.710
Frost throws a good party.

363
00:44:54.794 --> 00:44:57.880
Yeah, but where is he?

364
00:45:11.936 --> 00:45:13.062
Come on, baby.

365
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.783
Don't keep everyone waiting.

366
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:48.347
Man: [Over speaker] Deacon,
there's someone here to see you.

367
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:53.895
Krieger: I gotta talk to you, frost.

368
00:45:54.478 --> 00:45:56.689
I'm sorry. I had to come here.

369
00:45:56.772 --> 00:46:00.902
It's a mistake going to Pearl's.
I know that. Dumb fucking me.

370
00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:03.696
- I know you're disappointed.
- Am I that transparent?

371
00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:05.281
- You wanna meet him?
- Yeah.

372
00:46:05.363 --> 00:46:08.617
I can get you guys in with him,
we're tight. We're like brothers.

373
00:46:09.035 --> 00:46:11.204
Fuck. Frost...

374
00:46:11.287 --> 00:46:12.580
- Hey.
- Yeah.

375
00:46:13.664 --> 00:46:17.210
Deac, deac, I've been telling
these bitches all about you, man.

376
00:46:17.293 --> 00:46:18.878
They've been dying to meet you.

377
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:21.839
They are so psyched,
these badass bitches. I meet them...

378
00:46:21.923 --> 00:46:23.965
- Nice.
- Deac?

379
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.636
Frost, it's about blade.

380
00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:29.054
He's busy.
When he's focused on something...

381
00:46:29.138 --> 00:46:32.808
- He doesn't have time to fuck around.
- Krieger: Frost, this is important.

382
00:46:32.892 --> 00:46:37.021
Blade was waiting for me.
Look, they're using the girl as bait.

383
00:46:37.104 --> 00:46:39.941
- And you were stupid enough to take it.
- Shut up, bitch.

384
00:46:40.024 --> 00:46:43.444
I didn't know he was gonna be there.
It was a trap, see?

385
00:46:43.527 --> 00:46:46.739
But don't worry, it's no problem.
We can still get the girl.

386
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.575
Yeah.

387
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.583
- Whoo!
- Man: Yeah.

388
00:47:00.419 --> 00:47:02.755
Woman 1: Oh, come on.

389
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:06.050
- Oh, yes.
- Woman 2: All right.

390
00:47:18.229 --> 00:47:20.982
Forget the girl. I want blade.

391
00:47:21.065 --> 00:47:22.692
Mercury: I know you do.

392
00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:26.070
Frost: You hear me, Quinn?
I want him alive.

393
00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:27.238
What?

394
00:47:29.991 --> 00:47:33.160
Wait a minute, man.
You want him alive?

395
00:47:36.247 --> 00:47:38.624
Karen: What's that smell?

396
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:43.921
Man: Study the image carefully, frost.

397
00:47:44.005 --> 00:47:48.968
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

398
00:47:49.051 --> 00:47:50.469
Krieger, is that you?

399
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.972
He's here. He's here.

400
00:47:53.055 --> 00:47:55.808
Blade: This must be Pearl,
the record keeper.

401

[Farting]

402
00:47:57.143 --> 00:47:58.311
He's here.

403
00:47:58.394 --> 00:48:01.939
He's going to kill me.
You need me, frost. You need me.

404
00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:03.899
Pearl, you're history.

405
00:48:03.983 --> 00:48:06.569
Have the good grace
to die with some fucking dignity.

406
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.779
Pearl: Frost,
you useless bloodsucker.

407
00:48:09.864 --> 00:48:13.034
- Frost: Congratulations, blade.
- Frost.

408
00:48:13.117 --> 00:48:15.744
I hear you've been looking for me.
I'm flattered.

409
00:48:15.828 --> 00:48:17.163
It'll pass.

410
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:20.708
Fuck.

411
00:48:23.252 --> 00:48:26.881
- What is that?
- That, biscuit boy, is a uv lamp.

412
00:48:27.423 --> 00:48:29.716
We're gonna play a little game
of 20 questions.

413
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.553
Depending on how you answer,
you may walk out of here with a tan.

414
00:48:33.637 --> 00:48:35.765
What's that?

415
00:48:35.848 --> 00:48:39.352
Oh, that? Oh, it's nothing.
It's routine research.

416
00:48:39.435 --> 00:48:41.896
Actually, it's a video game.

417
00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:44.023
[Pearl screaming]

418
00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:54.283
That must have hurt.

419
00:48:54.367 --> 00:48:57.745
- It's a fragment, a piece of the prophecy.
- What prophecy?

420
00:48:57.828 --> 00:49:01.624
Oh, I'm not really sure.
There's so many. How could I...?

[In foreign language]

422
00:49:16.347 --> 00:49:19.517
And there is nothing you can do about it,
day Walker!

423
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.227
Is that so?

424
00:49:22.228 --> 00:49:24.522
Well, that's what frost says.

425
00:49:24.605 --> 00:49:27.691
Then you won't mind me borrowing this
for a while, will you?

If he moves, fry him.

427
00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:34.949
What's in here?

428
00:49:35.032 --> 00:49:37.785
Nothing. It's a storeroom.
You're wasting your time.

429
00:49:37.868 --> 00:49:39.870
There's nothing of importance
to anyone.

430
00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:43.249
- Then you won't mind if I take a peek.
- No!

431
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:06.981
He moved.

432
00:50:38.554 --> 00:50:40.598
Karen: What is this?

433
00:50:41.682 --> 00:50:44.852
Blade: These are the pages
from the book of erebus.

434
00:50:45.227 --> 00:50:47.605
The vampire Bible.

435
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.524
It contains everything...

436
00:50:52.067 --> 00:50:53.736
Their entire history.

437
00:50:54.904 --> 00:50:58.365
La magra must be one of their legends.

438
00:51:02.328 --> 00:51:03.954
Why is frost so interested
in la magra?

439
00:51:04.038 --> 00:51:06.081
Shh!

Well, well, well.
You took my arm, man.

You can slice him, you can dice him,
but the Quinn man just keeps on coming.

Check it out. I've got his pig-sticker.

ain't you, chief?

Stay away from me, sweetness...

456

459
00:53:30.142 --> 00:53:32.102
Probably cost you a pretty penny.

No. I'm something else.

Whistler: I found him
when he was 13.

498
00:58:09.338 --> 00:58:13.717
He'd been living on the streets,
feeding off the homeless.

499
00:58:14.176 --> 00:58:17.387
His need for blood
had taken hold at puberty.

500
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:21.099
I took him for a vampire at first.

501
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:23.769
Almost killed him too.

502
00:58:23.852 --> 00:58:26.605
Then I realized what he was.

503
00:58:27.147 --> 00:58:31.109
Blade's mother was attacked by
a vampire while she was pregnant.

504
00:58:31.193 --> 00:58:34.237
She died, but he lived.

505
00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:38.158
Unfortunately,
he'd undergone certain genetic changes.

506

He can withstand garlic, silver,
even sunlight.

00:58:47.542 --> 00:58:50.420
This time tomorrow,
all those wounds of his will be healed.

509

He still ages like a human, though.

See, vampires age slower than us.

511
00:58:58.804 --> 00:59:04.017

which order they'd die in.

522
00:59:50.981 --> 00:59:55.902
We kill as many of them as we can find,
but it's getting worse.

523
00:59:55.986 --> 00:59:57.320
Because of frost.

524
00:59:57.404 --> 01:00:00.907
There's something happening
in the vampire ranks.

525
01:00:00.991 --> 01:00:03.200
It's something big.

526
01:00:03.493 --> 01:00:07.914
And I'd stake my life
that son of a bitch is at the center of it.

527
01:00:11.501 --> 01:00:13.545
Karen: Blade?

528
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.398
Whistler told me what happened.

529
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:38.945
He told me what you are.

530
01:00:41.698 --> 01:00:43.950
You don't know me.

531
01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:46.870
You don't know anything about me.

532
01:00:49.206 --> 01:00:51.249
I'm not human.

533
01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:55.629
You look human to me...

534
01:00:55.712 --> 01:00:58.590
Humans don't drink blood.

535
01:00:58.673 --> 01:01:01.134
That was a long time ago.

536
01:01:01.968 --> 01:01:04.096
Maybe you should let that go.

537
01:01:06.932 --> 01:01:11.853
I have spent my whole life looking
for that thing that killed my mother...

538
01:01:12.687 --> 01:01:15.607
And made me what I am.

539
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.029
And every time I take one
of those monsters out...

540
01:01:21.113 --> 01:01:24.407
I get a little piece of that life back.

541
01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:28.036
So don't you tell me about forgetting.

542
01:01:31.498 --> 01:01:33.058
Quinn: My fault?
He took us by surprise!

543
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.961
Two of them against
your entire security force?

544
01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:38.338
Don't put that shit on me,
you were there too.

545
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:41.633
I'm sure Deacon will appreciate
our cutback in payroll.

546
01:01:41.716 --> 01:01:45.011
- Quinn: Ow! You little skeez.
- The amputee lifestyle really suits you.

547
01:01:45.095 --> 01:01:47.222
I should put this stump
through that grin.

548
01:01:47.305 --> 01:01:50.809
Face it, angel. You were sloppy.
You got what you deserved.

549
01:01:55.188 --> 01:01:57.148
Quinn: Deac,
let me take this guy out, man.

550
01:01:57.232 --> 01:01:59.734
Look what he fucking did!
He took my hand again!

551
01:01:59.818 --> 01:02:02.571
Listen to me. I want him alive.

552
01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:04.489
Quinn: What the fuck are you talk...?

553
01:02:04.573 --> 01:02:07.826
You want him alive? We've been trying
to kill this motherfucker for years.

554
01:02:07.909 --> 01:02:09.744
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You want...?

555
01:02:09.828 --> 01:02:14.624
Shh. Big guy, relax.

556
01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.042
Be patient.

557
01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:19.171
We got a lot to do here.

558
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.715
I need you, man.

559
01:02:25.677 --> 01:02:28.430
- I need you.
- Yeah.

560
01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:12.974
Frost: Good morning.

561
01:03:13.642 --> 01:03:15.769
How you feeling?

562
01:03:24.486 --> 01:03:26.446
Look at that.

563
01:03:29.324 --> 01:03:32.994
Ooh! Getting a little
toasty out here, huh?

564
01:03:34.412 --> 01:03:38.416
When was the last time you stopped
to appreciate a good sunrise?

565
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.628
That's right, you were born a vampire,
so you never had the pleasure, have you?

566
01:03:42.712 --> 01:03:45.674
That's okay. It's all right.

567
01:03:45.757 --> 01:03:49.052
At least we're here together.
Share the moment.

568
01:03:49.135 --> 01:03:51.805
Which means a lot to me
by the way, really.

569
01:03:51.888 --> 01:03:53.807
I mean that.

570
01:03:55.392 --> 01:03:57.727
Because actually,
when you get to know me...

571
01:03:57.811 --> 01:04:00.689
I'm a fairly sentimental type of guy.

572
01:04:00.772 --> 01:04:03.608
Bit of an innocent, you might say.

573
01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:08.112
Do what you want, frost.

574
01:04:08.446 --> 01:04:10.407
Doesn't make any difference.

575
01:04:11.825 --> 01:04:14.786
You just don't fucking get it.

576
01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:19.124
- You're never gonna be a pureblood.
- Hold him.

577
01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:24.170
Dragonetti: You will never rule us.

578
01:04:25.463 --> 01:04:28.091
[Dragonetti groaning]

579
01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:39.853
Jesus Christ. Have a nice day.

580
01:04:40.562 --> 01:04:43.648
Sorry, you old dog. You just got
a little too long in the teeth.

581
01:04:43.732 --> 01:04:45.190
[Laughing]

582
01:04:45.275 --> 01:04:50.030
What, man? That was funny.
"Long, tooth." It's funny, man.

583
01:04:50.113 --> 01:04:52.657
Did I tell you the one
about the leprechaun...?

584
01:04:56.369 --> 01:04:58.163
[Screaming]

585
01:05:21.478 --> 01:05:24.064
What have you done with dragonetti?

586
01:05:30.653 --> 01:05:33.156
Let's get down to business, shall we?

587
01:05:33.239 --> 01:05:36.159
I need 12 volunteers.

588
01:05:42.749 --> 01:05:44.626
Blade: Whistler.

589
01:05:47.087 --> 01:05:48.380
Whistler: What is this?

590
01:05:50.006 --> 01:05:52.634
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

591
01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:54.219
I took it from the archives.

592
01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:57.182
- Whistler: It's written in blood.
- Blade: It's from the book of erebus.

593
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.939
I think it's what frost
has been working on.

594
01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:09.484
Whistler: It's something about
the blood god, the spirits of the 12.

595
01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:12.028
I don't know.
I can't make out the rest of it.

596
01:06:12.112 --> 01:06:13.696
Well, maybe this'll help.

597
01:06:14.614 --> 01:06:16.908
We'll figure out something.

598
01:06:17.617 --> 01:06:19.202
Blade: So, what's all of this?

599
01:06:19.285 --> 01:06:23.790
Took a trip to the hospital last night,
borrowed some equipment.

600
01:06:24.082 --> 01:06:26.751
For your miracle cure?

601
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.214
Karen: This is edta.
It's an anticoagulant.

602
01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:33.425
We use it to treat blood clots.

603
01:06:34.467 --> 01:06:38.763
Look what happens when I introduce it
onto a sample of vampire blood.

604
01:06:40.473 --> 01:06:42.475
Take a step back.

605
01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:45.311
The reaction's energetic.

606
01:06:53.736 --> 01:06:57.782
- Some cure.
- Karen: I didn't say edta was a cure.

607
01:06:57.866 --> 01:07:02.412
But maybe you could use it
to explode some vampire heads.

608
01:07:04.372 --> 01:07:07.167
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.

609
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.879
Later. I gotta go downtown.

610
01:07:10.962 --> 01:07:13.756
- I need some serum.
- Whistler: Serum can wait.

611
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.259
This is important.

612
01:07:20.638 --> 01:07:22.432
[Coughing]

613
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.241
- Is he sick?
- Cancer.

614
01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:45.705
You have a lot of love for him,
don't you?

615
01:07:45.788 --> 01:07:50.793
We have a good arrangement.
He makes the weapons, I use them.

616
01:07:54.714 --> 01:07:59.219
You know, my mother used to say,
"a cold heart is a dead heart."

617
01:08:16.986 --> 01:08:19.364
You don't look so good.

618
01:08:19.948 --> 01:08:25.453
I'm just a little tired.
You know, we've been working all night.

619
01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:30.500
I guess we didn't catch it in time.

620
01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:35.672
You got another day, two at the most.

621
01:08:39.467 --> 01:08:41.760
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

622
01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:45.848
You make it sound like
I'm already dead.

623
01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:05.493
Frost: Blade.

624
01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:31.185
How you doing, chief?

625
01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:34.397
Easy.

626
01:09:35.356 --> 01:09:37.275
Wouldn't want our little friend here...

627
01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:40.111
To wind up on the back
of a milk carton, would we?

628
01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:47.160
It's nice to finally meet you, man.
Had my eye on you for years.

629
01:09:47.243 --> 01:09:52.290
I know all about you.
Your serum, whistler, everything.

630
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.334
Sunblock.

631
01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.794
Hey, it's a start, right?

632
01:09:56.878 --> 01:10:00.506
The goal, of course, is to be like you.
A day Walker.

633
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:04.177
You got the best of both worlds,
don't you?

634
01:10:05.136 --> 01:10:08.222
All our strengths,
none of our weaknesses.

635
01:10:09.015 --> 01:10:11.392
Well, maybe I don't see it that way.

636
01:10:11.476 --> 01:10:14.437
Oh, so it's back to pretending
we're human again?

637
01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.149
Come on.
Spare me the uncle Tom routine, okay?

638
01:10:18.232 --> 01:10:21.361
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

639
01:10:22.153 --> 01:10:26.407
You think the humans will ever accept
a half-breed like you? They can't.

640
01:10:26.491 --> 01:10:28.701
They're afraid of you.

641
01:10:28.785 --> 01:10:31.579
And they should be.
You're an animal.

642
01:10:31.663 --> 01:10:33.581
You're a fucking maniac.

643
01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:40.463
Look at them. They're cattle.

644
01:10:40.546 --> 01:10:42.465
Pieces of meat.

645
01:10:42.548 --> 01:10:45.426
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

646
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.806
Plague, war, famine.

647
01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:53.184
Morality doesn't even enter into it.

648
01:10:53.267 --> 01:10:58.189
We're just a function of natural
selection, man. The new race.

649
01:10:58.898 --> 01:11:01.359
Looks like your mascara's running.

650
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.537
I'm offering you a truce.
I want you with us.

651
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.415
What, do you think I'm stupid?

652
01:11:16.249 --> 01:11:18.084
[In foreign language]

653
01:11:23.297 --> 01:11:25.174
You're familiar with the blood god.

654
01:11:25.258 --> 01:11:27.510
[In English] Frost...

655
01:11:27.927 --> 01:11:30.555
You're nothing to me...

656
01:11:30.638 --> 01:11:33.599
But another dead vampire.

657
01:11:33.683 --> 01:11:36.352
You're an idiot, you know that?

658
01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:38.813
I came down here
offering you an easy way out...

659
01:11:38.896 --> 01:11:42.150
And you spit it right back
in my fucking face.

660
01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:44.777
Careful.

661
01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:50.783
What do I care?

662
01:11:50.867 --> 01:11:54.996
They're nothing but cattle,
just like you said.

663
01:11:55.538 --> 01:11:58.750
If you wanna take the hard road,
be my guest, pal.

664
01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:01.169
But I promise you,
by the time this is over...

665
01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:04.797
You're gonna wish they never cut you
from your mother's womb.

666
01:12:13.723 --> 01:12:15.516
[Screaming]

667
01:12:38.873 --> 01:12:40.166
Go home.

668
01:12:44.086 --> 01:12:46.631
It's simple.
Why do vampires need to drink blood?

669
01:12:46.714 --> 01:12:49.467
Because their own blood
can't sustain hemoglobin.

670
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.553
Right. So it's a genetic defect
just like hemolytic anemia.

671
01:12:52.637 --> 01:12:55.348
That means that we have to treat it
with gene therapy.

672
01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:59.060
Rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

673
01:12:59.143 --> 01:13:01.312
They've been using it
on sickle-cell anemia.

674
01:13:01.395 --> 01:13:02.688
Are you sure that's safe?

675
01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:07.026
I have no idea,
but I don't have a choice, do I?

676
01:13:09.195 --> 01:13:11.030
You actually think this could work?

677
01:13:11.113 --> 01:13:14.909
On me? Yes.

678
01:13:15.159 --> 01:13:17.036
On blade, I'm not so sure.

679
01:13:17.119 --> 01:13:20.623
See, he didn't contract vampirism
from a bite like I did.

680
01:13:20.706 --> 01:13:24.544
He was born with it.
It's part of his DNA.

681
01:13:25.628 --> 01:13:29.173
I'm sure I can cure his thirst,
but it's gonna take time.

682
01:13:29.257 --> 01:13:31.801
We're out of time.

683
01:13:31.884 --> 01:13:34.720
You saw what was on that disk.

684

685
01:13:39.308 --> 01:13:41.227
Damn.

686
01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:43.771
Get out of here.

01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:01.080
[Yells]

688
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.423
I said, get out of here.

689
01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:19.932
Nice place. Took us a while to find it.

690
01:14:28.232 --> 01:14:31.027
- Bite me and get it over with.
- I ain't gonna bite you.

691
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.584
Do your thing.

692
01:14:58.387 --> 01:15:00.264
Whistler?

693
01:16:07.289 --> 01:16:09.125
Frost took her.

694
01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:19.093
Listen to me.

695
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.597
The disk...

696
01:16:23.848 --> 01:16:25.433
We decoded it.

697
01:16:25.933 --> 01:16:32.189
Frost is trying to trigger
a fucking vampire apocalypse.

698
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.736
There's some kind of...

699
01:16:37.028 --> 01:16:40.906
Vampire god he's trying to resurrect.

700
01:16:41.699 --> 01:16:43.159
La magra.

701
01:16:46.704 --> 01:16:49.123
You're the key.

702
01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:51.625
He needs your blood.

703
01:16:55.379 --> 01:16:58.174
The blood of the day Walker.

704
01:17:00.468 --> 01:17:02.720
You're the chosen one.

705
01:17:06.307 --> 01:17:08.642
Listen to me, blade.

706
01:17:09.477 --> 01:17:12.813
- You can't go after him.
- Bullshit.

707
01:17:12.897 --> 01:17:18.235
If frost gets his hands on you,
it's all over.

708
01:17:20.529 --> 01:17:23.616
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

709
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:28.037
Shit.

710
01:17:31.957 --> 01:17:33.667
You're gonna have to finish me off.

711
01:17:35.336 --> 01:17:37.963
Don't want me coming back.

712
01:17:39.298 --> 01:17:40.883
We can treat the wounds.

713
01:17:42.676 --> 01:17:44.261
It's too far gone.

714
01:17:45.179 --> 01:17:47.556
You know that.

715
01:17:50.267 --> 01:17:52.436
Give me your gun.

716
01:17:54.313 --> 01:17:55.647
No.

717
01:17:57.024 --> 01:17:59.360
Give me the goddamn gun.

718
01:18:24.468 --> 01:18:28.138
Now walk away,
you stupid son of a bitch.

719
01:18:32.977 --> 01:18:35.312
Walk the fuck away.

720
01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:46.490
[Gunshot]

721
01:18:56.416 --> 01:19:00.044
By the time you watch this,
your friend whistler should be dead.

722
01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:03.382
If it makes any difference to you,
he put up quite a fight.

723
01:19:03.674 --> 01:19:06.760
You can find us
at the edgewood towers.

724
01:20:44.358 --> 01:20:46.819
You seem a bit tense.

725
01:20:46.902 --> 01:20:50.197
A bit pent-up maybe,
like you need to release something.

726
01:20:51.782 --> 01:20:57.037
No?
Blade not... giving it to you maybe?

727
01:20:58.289 --> 01:21:00.249
I don't know, I just...

728
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:03.460
I see such a beautiful woman.

729
01:21:04.378 --> 01:21:06.630
Great skin.

730
01:21:08.507 --> 01:21:10.384
I'd like to see you happy, that's all.

731
01:21:10.467 --> 01:21:14.513
Is this the part
where you offer to turn me?

732
01:21:15.264 --> 01:21:17.725
Well, it's either that or a body bag.

733
01:21:18.225 --> 01:21:21.020
Go ahead. Bite me.

734
01:21:21.854 --> 01:21:24.064
I'll just cure myself.

735
01:21:24.148 --> 01:21:27.234
I did it before, and I can do it again.

736
01:21:27.318 --> 01:21:31.363
- There is no cure, baby.
- There is if you've been bitten.

737
01:21:31.739 --> 01:21:34.033
If you were once human.

738
01:21:39.455 --> 01:21:41.999
How'd you get that scar, Deacon?

739
01:21:42.082 --> 01:21:45.252
A born vampire would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

740
01:21:45.336 --> 01:21:48.422
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

741
01:21:49.256 --> 01:21:50.966
Isn't that right?

742
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:53.676
Vampires like you aren't a species.

743
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:58.097
You're just infected, a virus,
a sexually-transmitted disease...

744
01:21:58.182 --> 01:22:00.392
I'll tell you what we are, sister.

745
01:22:00.476 --> 01:22:04.021
We're the top of the fucking food chain.
The blood god's coming...

746
01:22:04.104 --> 01:22:08.025
And after tonight,
you people are fucking history.

747
01:22:08.108 --> 01:22:11.820
He's a hurricane, an act of god.

748
01:22:11.904 --> 01:22:14.531
Anyone caught in his path
will instantly be turned.

749
01:22:16.575 --> 01:22:18.452
Everyone you've ever known...

750
01:22:18.535 --> 01:22:21.914
Everyone you've ever fucking loved.

751
01:22:21.997 --> 01:22:25.334
It won't matter who's pureblood
and who's not.

752
01:22:26.043 --> 01:22:28.962
How you gonna cure
the whole fucking world?

753
01:22:34.675 --> 01:22:37.053
And blade's blood is the key.

754
01:22:37.429 --> 01:22:38.847
We've got an intruder.

755
01:22:50.609 --> 01:22:52.319
[Elevator dings]

756
01:22:52.403 --> 01:22:55.322
[Motor revving]

757
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:08.085
[Tires squealing]

758
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:10.504
I don't think you understand.
This dude is bad.

759
01:23:10.587 --> 01:23:12.714
He had 20 guys around him...
I was there.

760
01:23:12.798 --> 01:23:15.551
- He's got shit he throws...
- He's got the sword and shit.

761
01:23:15.634 --> 01:23:19.179
Yeah, he can throw it in the air,
catch it underneath. Shut the fuck up!

762
01:23:19.263 --> 01:23:21.598
Man: [On radio] There's no
entrance or exits where we are.

763
01:23:21.682 --> 01:23:23.809
Make it happen, all right?
It's one guy on foot.

764
01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:29.189
Get him! Get him! Go!

765
01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:30.649
That's him, get him!

766
01:23:50.002 --> 01:23:52.713
Why am I hearing gunfire? Huh?

767
01:23:52.796 --> 01:23:55.883
Did I tell anybody to start shooting?
I need him alive.

768
01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:58.385
Man 1:

769
01:24:00.262 --> 01:24:03.182
Please. I just work for them.

770
01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:08.395
- Jesus Christ. Lock this place down.
- Man 2: Yes, sir.

771
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:48.852
[Screaming]

772
01:25:56.044 --> 01:25:57.462
Eric?

773
01:26:09.057 --> 01:26:10.183
But you died.

774
01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:15.271
I came back, Eric.
That very same night.

775
01:26:17.316 --> 01:26:20.777
And Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

776
01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:30.162
[Grunting]

777
01:26:36.543 --> 01:26:38.712
Jesus Christ.
I thought you'd be happy.

778
01:26:40.714 --> 01:26:44.051
You're finally being reunited
with your mother, and you act like this?

779
01:26:44.718 --> 01:26:46.595
Blade, give it up. It's over.

780
01:26:47.095 --> 01:26:49.598
She belongs to me, buddy.

781
01:26:51.808 --> 01:26:53.185
Don't look so surprised.

782
01:26:54.519 --> 01:26:58.023
You spent your whole life looking
for the vampire who bit your mother.

783
01:26:58.106 --> 01:26:59.983
Well, here I am.

784
01:27:02.736 --> 01:27:06.114
Who would have ever guessed
you'd survive your mother's death?

785
01:27:06.198 --> 01:27:09.159
But you did, and here we are...

786
01:27:09.242 --> 01:27:11.411
One big happy fucking family.

787
01:27:23.298 --> 01:27:25.759
I need my serum.

788
01:27:27.594 --> 01:27:30.931
Maybe when we get out of this,
I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

789
01:27:31.014 --> 01:27:32.641
Karen: There's one catch.

790
01:27:37.062 --> 01:27:38.438
If it works...

791
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:44.027
You'll lose your strength
and your ability to regenerate.

792
01:27:44.568 --> 01:27:47.279
You'll be completely human.

793
01:28:07.801 --> 01:28:09.469
[Grunts]

794
01:28:24.693 --> 01:28:27.821
Come here. Get up, damn it.

795
01:28:49.092 --> 01:28:52.763
Frost: Blade, Karen,
glad you could make it.

796
01:28:52.846 --> 01:28:56.349
Hey, man. Thanks for the shades.

797
01:28:57.767 --> 01:29:02.062
Our ancestors called this place
the temple of eternal night.

798
01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.443
Nice, isn't it?

799
01:29:06.526 --> 01:29:10.071
Apparently,
these geniuses forgot it ever existed.

800
01:29:10.155 --> 01:29:12.365
Fortunately for us...

801
01:29:12.449 --> 01:29:17.120
I'm what you might call
a student of history.

802
01:29:30.008 --> 01:29:31.968
Why are we here?

803
01:29:34.345 --> 01:29:37.848
This temple was built
for one glorious moment:

804
01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:42.270
This night, for the blood god.

805
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:51.947
Thanks.

806
01:29:56.076 --> 01:29:58.620
Let's see this sword of yours.

807
01:30:02.958 --> 01:30:05.877
Titanium, right? Acid-etched?

808
01:30:08.338 --> 01:30:10.257
I could get used to a weapon like this.

809
01:30:16.388 --> 01:30:19.975
What? You look surprised.

810
01:30:20.934 --> 01:30:23.854
I told you, blade,
I know everything about you.

811
01:30:25.146 --> 01:30:26.398
Hold out your arm, Quinn.

812
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:28.817
Why, man?
Because they're, like, all better.

813
01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.237
Hold out your arm. Now.

814
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:36.825
Quinn: Deac, I...

815
01:30:41.496 --> 01:30:43.081
Just kidding.

816
01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.420
He was fucking with me, man.
He was, like, fucking with me.

817
01:30:48.503 --> 01:30:50.213
Blade.

818
01:30:51.006 --> 01:30:53.133
- Blade.
- He can't hear you, honey.

819
01:30:53.216 --> 01:30:55.719
The thirst has got him now.

820
01:31:01.433 --> 01:31:02.642
What do we have here?

821
01:31:03.393 --> 01:31:05.353
The precious serum.

822
01:31:07.522 --> 01:31:12.068
How long's it been since you shot up?
Twelve, 13 hours maybe?

823
01:31:12.485 --> 01:31:15.572
I bet you're just dying for a drink,
aren't you?

824
01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:20.452
What's it feel like?

825
01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:23.204
Is your blood on fire?

826
01:31:23.872 --> 01:31:25.874
Try some.

827
01:31:26.207 --> 01:31:28.460
You might like it.

828
01:31:28.543 --> 01:31:31.004
Thanks, but I prefer the real thing.

829
01:31:32.047 --> 01:31:36.509
In any event, I don't think
you'll be needing these anymore.

830
01:31:43.266 --> 01:31:47.270
It's a shame, you know?
When I think of what you've become...

831
01:31:48.146 --> 01:31:50.065
What you should have become.

832
01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.902
I guess I don't blame you. I mean,
with everything that's happened...

833
01:31:53.985 --> 01:31:57.113
It's the human side of you
that's made you weak.

834
01:31:57.197 --> 01:32:01.326
- You should've listened to your blood.
- You can say what you want...

835
01:32:01.409 --> 01:32:04.329
But I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

836
01:32:04.412 --> 01:32:06.039
Ooh.

837
01:32:06.122 --> 01:32:08.708
[Quinn laughing]

838
01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:10.209
Get him out of here.

839
01:32:14.631 --> 01:32:17.050
Get these fucks downstairs. Now.

840
01:32:17.133 --> 01:32:20.595
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on, now.

841
01:32:21.137 --> 01:32:22.430
Man: Come on.

842
01:32:25.141 --> 01:32:27.978
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We haven't forgotten about you.

843
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:32.857
Oh, no, baby. We got something
real special planned for you.

844
01:32:32.941 --> 01:32:35.860
Quinn: Found me a surfer boy
with a nice ass and I sucked him dry.

845
01:32:35.944 --> 01:32:39.113
- And you'd figure he'd turn, right?
- But he didn't turn, did he?

846
01:32:39.197 --> 01:32:43.576
No, he turned into some kind of zombie.
It happens sometimes, cutie.

847
01:32:44.244 --> 01:32:46.955
- Quinn: He was fucking tripped out.
- Frost: Pathetic.

848
01:32:47.038 --> 01:32:49.916
Quinn: These guys are complete scum,
man. They'll eat anything.

849
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.795
Animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

850
01:32:55.213 --> 01:32:56.673
They'll even eat vampires.

851
01:32:56.756 --> 01:32:58.091
That's a plus.

852
01:32:58.174 --> 01:33:02.345
And bearing that all in mind, I'd like
you to meet an old friend of yours.

853
01:33:03.346 --> 01:33:06.850
[Karen grunting]

854
01:33:07.642 --> 01:33:11.438
It's too bad. I kind of liked her.

855
01:33:12.105 --> 01:33:14.232
What a waste.

856
01:33:32.625 --> 01:33:34.544
[Curtis groans]

857
01:33:34.627 --> 01:33:37.547
Curtis: I don't know
what's happening to me.

858
01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:39.466
No pulse.

859
01:33:39.549 --> 01:33:42.719
And, of course,
there's the question of lividity.

860
01:33:44.387 --> 01:33:45.555
Guns?

861
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.812
Karen?

862
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:55.023
Karen.

863
01:33:55.106 --> 01:33:57.984
I never thought
I would see you again.

864
01:33:58.068 --> 01:34:01.488
Tell me, Karen, do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

865
