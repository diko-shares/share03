1
00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:03.624
Man: Police found her in the street.

2
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.376
Looks like she was bitten
by some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.714
Woman: Jesus. Her water's broken.
She's going into uterine contractions.

4
00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:12.382
We have to do a c-section.

5
00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:13.944
- What you got down there, little man?
- That's my heat-seeker.

6
00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:15.279
I'll bet it is.

7
00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:21.951
- So where we going?
- It's a surprise, baby.

8
00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:26.248
Yeah, I like surprises. Yeah.

9
00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:31.795
Oh, my god.

10
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.506
What the fuck are we doing here?

11
00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:38.927
Whoo. Look at all that.

12
00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.473
What the fuck is that?

13
00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:51.148
Hey.

14
00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.153
What did you just say?

15
00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:35.442
Wow.

16
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:54.920
Hey, what's up? Oh, man.

17
00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:06.640
Whoo! All right.

18
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:16.983
Yeah. Whoo!

19
00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.333
What's happening?

20
00:04:41.675 --> 00:04:42.801
Hey, man.

21
00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:50.142
Fuck.

22
00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:02.571
Fuck, I need a drink.

23
00:05:50.076 --> 00:05:51.411
No. No.

24
00:05:57.292 --> 00:05:58.626
What's wrong, baby?

25
00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:04.633
No!

26
00:06:09.513 --> 00:06:10.597
Oh, no.

27
00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:36.873
Man 1: Shut up, man.

28
00:06:55.684 --> 00:06:58.562
- Woman: Is that him?
- Man 2: Jesus, it's him.

29
00:07:00.063 --> 00:07:01.356
Man 3: It's the day Walker.

30
00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:25.213
Come on, day Walker!

31
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.653
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off.

32
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.632
- Look out! Hey, out of the way!
- Get out of there!

33
00:08:42.165 --> 00:08:46.044
That's him. That's him.
Get him. Fuck him up.

34
00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:51.341
We're gonna Jack you up.
Make him hurt bad. Whoo!

35
00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:56.531
Quinn...

36
00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:01.619
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

37
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.210
Thought I might try fire, for a change.

38
00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:14.174
Give my regards to frost.

39
00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:20.013
No, please. Please don't.

40
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:22.135
Man 1: Over here, sergeant.

41
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.487
- Put him out.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.655
Man 2: Paramedics, coming through.

43
00:11:00.178 --> 00:11:03.807
Got a charred cadaver here for you.
It's still warm too.

44
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.391
One, two, three.

45
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.399
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

46
00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:16.694
Man: Paramedics said he was
still screaming when they found him...

47
00:11:16.778 --> 00:11:19.322
Stapled to a wall.

48
00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:21.699
Curtis: That's very pretty.

49
00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:38.091
Curtis: Did you check the chem panel?
Blood sugar's three times the norm.

50
00:11:38.174 --> 00:11:40.343
Phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

51
00:11:40.426 --> 00:11:42.679
Karen: You took this off a doa?

52
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:45.305
Yeah.

53
00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:47.684
But this doesn't make any sense.

54
00:11:51.563 --> 00:11:54.107
The red blood cells are biconvex,
which is impossible.

55
00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:57.527
Look at the polys, they're binucleated.

56
00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:04.909
- Okay, Curtis, it's 3:00 in the morning...
- This is not a joke.

57
00:12:04.993 --> 00:12:08.246
I've got the body sitting in the morgue
right now.

58
00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:11.875
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

59
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.627
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

60
00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:24.888
Okay. Show me the body.

61
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:27.223
And I don't wanna hear
a word about us.

62
00:12:27.307 --> 00:12:30.727
Done. We've had that conversation.

63
00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:36.316
You haven't started
on the internal organs yet?

64
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.569
No, just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

65
00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:44.240
The maxilla looks a little deformed.

66
00:12:44.324 --> 00:12:46.910
There's some odd muscle structure
around the canines.

67
00:12:46.993 --> 00:12:49.996
I'm gonna go ahead start the y
and check the tracheal mucosa.

68
00:12:55.043 --> 00:12:57.462
Let me ask you something.

69
00:12:58.338 --> 00:13:00.256
Honestly.

70
00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:03.551
You ever have second thoughts
about us?

71
00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:06.930
Sometimes.

72
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.768
But then I remember
how much of an asshole you were.

73
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:13.561
You wanna cut me some slack here?

74
00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:16.314
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

75
00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:18.775
- Look, Curtis, it's over.
- I'm trying. Really, I am.

76
00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:41.839
- Man 1: Call security!
- Man 2: Get back!

77
00:13:56.813 --> 00:13:58.523
Came back to finish you off.

78
00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.483
Get out of my way, you freak.

79
00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:09.075
Freeze!

80
00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:13.621
Motherfucker,
are you out of your damn mind?

81
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.066
- Man 1: He's there, right there.
- Man 2: Go ahead.

82
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.675
- Go.
- Man 3: Hey, you, freeze.

83
00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:09.359
- Man 4: Come on. Come on.
- Man 5: Fire.

84
00:15:10.678 --> 00:15:11.887
Man 6: Keep going. Keep going.

85
00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:16.517
Man 7: Come back out.

86
00:15:17.393 --> 00:15:19.395
- Man 3: Go.
- Man 7: He can't get out.

87
00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:28.653
- Freeze!
- Man 1: Hold it right there.

88
00:15:28.738 --> 00:15:30.823
- Man 2: Don't do it.
- Man 3: Hey, hey...

89
00:15:44.587 --> 00:15:46.214
Karen: My shoulder...

90
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:48.883
Is dislocated.

91
00:17:35.281 --> 00:17:37.658
I feel rivers overflowing.

92
00:17:37.742 --> 00:17:39.619
Blade: Whistler.

93
00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.123
Whistler.

94
00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:51.631
Whistler: Bringing home strays now?

95
00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:55.343
She's been bitten.

96
00:17:59.764 --> 00:18:01.516
Should've killed her, then.

97
00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.601
Yeah, I know...

98
00:18:05.478 --> 00:18:06.979
But I didn't.

99
00:18:13.778 --> 00:18:18.991
You watch her close.
She starts to turn, you finish her off.

100
00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:24.956
Or I will.

101
00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:33.631
She's borderline.

102
00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:39.136
Another hour,
she'd be well into the change.

103
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:44.308
Dr. Karen jenson, listen close.

104
00:18:44.642 --> 00:18:49.063
I'm gonna inject you
with allium sativum. Garlic.

105
00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:51.232
This is gonna hurt a lot.

106
00:18:51.315 --> 00:18:53.276
It was Quinn.

107
00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:55.945
Frost's little errand boy?

108
00:18:56.445 --> 00:18:59.031
- You get a lead on him?
- No.

109
00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:01.701
Whistler: Too bad.

110
00:19:04.537 --> 00:19:06.455
Hold her.

111
00:19:16.632 --> 00:19:21.345
I give her fifty-fifty,
if she makes it through the night.

112
00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:51.125
Blade, the day Walker.

113
00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:53.794
Still pursuing his ridiculous crusade.

114
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.634
How many died?

115
00:20:00.092 --> 00:20:04.722
We don't have an exact count.
Apparently, he used a lot of silver.

116
00:20:05.556 --> 00:20:08.351
- We're having difficulty...
- Send in frost.

117
00:20:16.692 --> 00:20:17.777
Deacon frost.

118
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:24.075
You can come in now.

119
00:20:58.109 --> 00:21:00.152
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

120
00:21:00.236 --> 00:21:01.987
Are they?

121
00:21:02.071 --> 00:21:05.783
They draw needless attention
to our kind. You know our policy.

122
00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:07.868
Your policy, not mine.

123
00:21:08.494 --> 00:21:10.079
Dragonetti: Our livelihood...

124
00:21:10.996 --> 00:21:15.084
Depends on our ability to blend in...

125
00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:16.711
On our discretion.

126
00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:20.965
Maybe it's time
we forgot about discretion.

127
00:21:21.674 --> 00:21:23.426
We should be ruling the humans...

128
00:21:23.509 --> 00:21:26.554
Not running around
making back-alley treaties with them.

129
00:21:26.637 --> 00:21:30.181
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food not our allies.

130
00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:33.102
- You're out of line, frost.
- Am I?

131
00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:36.981
Maybe I'm just the first to say out loud
what we've all been thinking.

132
00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:41.694
We have existed this way
for thousands of years.

133
00:21:41.777 --> 00:21:46.449
Who are you to challenge our ways?

134
00:21:46.532 --> 00:21:48.701
You're not even a pureblood.

135
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:53.330
Like it matters.

136
00:21:54.623 --> 00:21:58.377
I was born a vampire...

137
00:21:58.461 --> 00:22:02.256
As was every other member
of this house.

138
00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:03.507
But, you, frost...

139
00:22:07.052 --> 00:22:09.555
You were merely turned.

140
00:22:11.682 --> 00:22:15.686
The world belongs to us,
not the humans.

141
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.189
You know that.

142
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.986
Do we have any other business
to discuss?

143
00:22:25.821 --> 00:22:30.201
Well, there's the matter of our offshore
accounts. We're having difficulty...

144
00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:31.994
And have you made the transfer...?

145
00:22:32.077 --> 00:22:37.416
Gaetano, you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

146
00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:14.161
- You're a week early.
- Yeah.

147
00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:24.964
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

148
00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:29.218
Yeah, I figured that might happen.

149
00:23:38.435 --> 00:23:40.729
You take care, all right?

150
00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:27.544
Whistler: I must be getting soft
in my old age...

151
00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:30.506
Letting you bring home
a stray like that.

152
00:25:31.173 --> 00:25:36.095
It was damn stupid of you.
You might have lucked out though.

153
00:25:37.054 --> 00:25:39.306
I checked her background.

154
00:25:42.017 --> 00:25:45.269
Turns out she's a hematologist.

155
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.732
She might be useful to us.

156
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.527
Blade: I doubt it.

157
00:25:52.569 --> 00:25:54.196
Whistler: I'm serious.

158
00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:59.326
I took a look at that notebook of hers.
She's on to something.

159
00:26:01.245 --> 00:26:02.705
I had to increase the dose.

160
00:26:04.248 --> 00:26:07.626
It's over 50 milligrams now.
That's getting dangerous.

161
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.172
Just do it, old man.

162
00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:13.692
Wander off the beaten path, doctor?

163
00:27:15.611 --> 00:27:17.488
Who are you people?

164
00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:18.989
My name's Abraham whistler.

165
00:27:20.449 --> 00:27:21.742
You've met blade.

166
00:27:38.008 --> 00:27:39.802
So am I a prisoner here?

167
00:27:41.303 --> 00:27:43.305
Not at all.

168
00:27:43.388 --> 00:27:47.559
We just had to take certain precautions
before we let you go.

169
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.063
You gotta understand,
they're everywhere.

170
00:27:51.146 --> 00:27:53.065
Vampires.

171
00:27:53.148 --> 00:27:54.775
The hominis nocturna.

172
00:27:56.068 --> 00:27:57.694
We hunt them, you see.

173
00:27:57.778 --> 00:28:01.448
Moving from one city to the next
tracking their migrations.

174
00:28:01.532 --> 00:28:02.866
They're hard to kill.

175
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.620
- They tend to regenerate.
- And I'm supposed to believe all this?

176
00:28:06.703 --> 00:28:09.790
Well, you already met Mr. Crispy
at the hospital.

177
00:28:09.873 --> 00:28:11.458
What do you think?

178
00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:17.464
So, what do you use, then?
Stakes? Crosses?

179
00:28:17.548 --> 00:28:22.344
Crosses don't do squat.
Some of the legends are true, though.

180
00:28:22.427 --> 00:28:26.223
Vampires are severely allergic to silver.

181
00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:29.184
Feed them garlic
and they go into anaphylactic shock.

182
00:28:29.268 --> 00:28:32.646
Then, of course, there's always sunlight,
ultraviolet rays.

183
00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:38.318
I got this sucker running.
You wanna give it a try tonight?

184
00:28:44.283 --> 00:28:45.701
Still heavy.

185
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.537
But you're so big.

186
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:54.626
If you wanna live to see another day,
you'll be out of town by nightfall.

187
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.461
So where am I supposed to go?

188
00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:02.801
You've been exposed to them.

189
00:29:03.051 --> 00:29:06.722
One way or another,
somebody's gonna take you out.

190
00:29:10.934 --> 00:29:13.645
There's a war going on out there.

191
00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:16.982
Blade, myself, a few others...

192
00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:20.235
We've tried to keep it
from spilling over onto the streets...

193
00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:24.740
But sometimes, people like yourself
get caught in the crossfire.

194
00:29:24.823 --> 00:29:27.534
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

195
00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:30.162
They own the police.

196
00:29:30.245 --> 00:29:32.830
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

197
00:29:32.915 --> 00:29:35.709
Chances are you've seen them yourself
and didn't know it.

198
00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:37.502
On the subway or in a bar.

199
00:29:39.838 --> 00:29:41.757
So that's it?

200
00:29:42.716 --> 00:29:45.552
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way.

201
00:29:49.598 --> 00:29:53.560
Here. Vampire mace.

202
00:29:54.478 --> 00:29:56.396
Silver nitrate, essence of garlic.

203
00:29:57.356 --> 00:29:59.107
You keep your eyes open.

204
00:29:59.816 --> 00:30:01.609
Be careful.

205
00:30:05.155 --> 00:30:07.407
One other thing...

206
00:30:07.908 --> 00:30:10.369
Buy yourself a gun.

207
00:30:11.078 --> 00:30:13.288
If you start getting sensitive
to daylight...

208
00:30:14.665 --> 00:30:19.670
If you find you're thirsty, regardless
of how much you've had to drink...

209
00:30:19.962 --> 00:30:24.049
Then I suggest you take that gun
and use it on yourself.

210
00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:30.138
Better that than the alternative.

211
00:31:27.446 --> 00:31:29.530
You have been warned before.

212
00:31:29.614 --> 00:31:34.119
These archives are restricted
to the members of the house of erebus.

213
00:31:36.121 --> 00:31:40.125
You are wasting your time.
It's a dead language.

214
00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:43.837
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

215
00:31:45.297 --> 00:31:47.465
You wouldn't even understand them.

216
00:31:49.926 --> 00:31:52.137
Damn it, frost, I'm talking to you!

217
00:31:53.138 --> 00:31:56.058
Shh.

218
00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:59.102
Keep your voice down, gaetano.

219
00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:03.273
We're in a library.
You don't need to shout.

220
00:32:04.733 --> 00:32:07.069
What are you up to, frost?

221
00:32:18.372 --> 00:32:21.291
What are you gonna do? Hm?

222
00:32:26.129 --> 00:32:27.839
What?

223
00:32:32.427 --> 00:32:34.679
You bore me.

224
00:33:09.172 --> 00:33:12.008
Blade: Remember what we told you.

225
00:33:12.092 --> 00:33:15.345
You keep your eyes open.
They're everywhere.

226
00:33:17.305 --> 00:33:18.849
But it's daytime.

227
00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:27.959
- Man 1: Hey, hey, hey, that's mine.
- Man 2: Spare some change?

228
00:33:52.757 --> 00:33:55.385
- Man 3: Anything else?
- Woman: No, that's it.

229
00:34:18.658 --> 00:34:19.868
How you doing?

230
00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:44.411
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. I'm a police officer.

231
00:35:44.494 --> 00:35:47.497
I'm sorry, okay? Police officer.
I didn't mean to scare you.

232
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:50.250
- The front door was open.
- What are you doing in here?

233
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:52.711
I'm just here on a routine check.

234
00:35:52.794 --> 00:35:56.006
Look, I'm officer Krieger,
42nd precinct.

235
00:35:56.548 --> 00:35:58.925
You're Karen Jensen, fight'?

236
00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:00.719
Yeah.

237
00:36:00.802 --> 00:36:05.098
Your co-workers at the hospital said
that you were kidnapped last night.

238
00:36:05.765 --> 00:36:07.517
Are you okay?

239
00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:10.770
Karen: What happened
to the other doctor I was with?

240
00:36:12.314 --> 00:36:15.191
Curtis webb, he died.

241
00:36:16.693 --> 00:36:19.195
No, look, don't worry
about that right now, okay?

242
00:36:20.447 --> 00:36:24.492
- Why?
- Because you're dead too, bitch.

243
00:36:27.954 --> 00:36:30.665
Son of a bitch, what is this?

244
00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:33.752
What is this, garlic?

245
00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:36.963
Yeah, well,
he said it would work against vampires.

246
00:36:37.047 --> 00:36:39.049
Vampires?

247
00:36:39.132 --> 00:36:41.217
Who said I was a vampire, huh?

248
00:36:43.428 --> 00:36:44.679
Nobody.

249
00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:51.269
He's a familiar.

250
00:36:52.312 --> 00:36:54.689
A vampire wannabe.

251
00:36:55.023 --> 00:36:57.400
If he's loyal enough...

252
00:36:57.484 --> 00:37:00.987
And he proves himself,
maybe his master will turn him.

253
00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:05.075
Wait a minute. You used me as bait?

254
00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:06.701
Get over it.

255
00:37:11.623 --> 00:37:13.833
Is all that necessary?

256
00:37:17.962 --> 00:37:21.465
Blade: That's a glyph,
a vampire cattle brand.

257
00:37:21.549 --> 00:37:24.344
It means officer Krieger here
is somebody's property.

258
00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:27.013
Another vampire tries to bleed
this little hooker...

259
00:37:27.097 --> 00:37:29.099
Then they have to answer
to his owner.

260
00:37:30.975 --> 00:37:35.605
Deacon frost.
We've been tracking him for a long time.

261
00:37:36.106 --> 00:37:41.695
All right, officer Krieger, you gonna be
a good little bloodhound, huh?

262
00:37:41.778 --> 00:37:43.780
Tell us what your master's been up to?

263
00:37:43.863 --> 00:37:46.616
Great, now you're robbing him.
You gonna Rob me too?

264
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.744
How do you think that
we fund this organization, huh?

265
00:37:49.828 --> 00:37:52.914
We're not exactly the march of dimes.

266
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.626
It's fake.

267
00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:03.216
Well, looks like our friend here's
been blood running.

268
00:38:04.134 --> 00:38:07.220
Hillburn clinic.
I know this place, it's a blood bank.

269
00:38:07.302 --> 00:38:10.264
Blade: Owned by vampires,
and there's one in every city.

270
00:38:10.348 --> 00:38:13.226
And they always deliver.
So where were you taking it?

271
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:15.311
I don't know what you're talking...

272
00:38:16.938 --> 00:38:18.690
Look, take it easy.

273
00:38:18.773 --> 00:38:23.445
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.
Where were you taking it?

274
00:38:23.528 --> 00:38:24.696
Go fuck yourself.

275
00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:27.407
- Fuck me? No, you suck this.
- No, look.

276
00:38:28.032 --> 00:38:29.075
Get out of the way.

277
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.372
Woman: Oh, my god.

278
00:38:37.834 --> 00:38:39.544
Look, right over there.

279
00:38:44.466 --> 00:38:46.551
You better wake up.

280
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:49.721
The world you live in
is just a sugarcoated topping.

281
00:38:49.804 --> 00:38:53.432
There is another world beneath it,
the real world.

282
00:38:53.516 --> 00:38:58.062
And if you wanna survive it,
you'd better learn to pull the trigger.

283
00:39:01.566 --> 00:39:03.485
Karen: Wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

284
00:39:03.568 --> 00:39:04.736
You're useless.

285
00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:10.783
I have to stick with you.

286
00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:15.038
It's the only way that I'll stay alive
long enough to find a cure for myself.

287
00:39:15.121 --> 00:39:17.624
There is no cure.

288
00:39:27.801 --> 00:39:30.136
He's not gonna come back.

289
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.055
Nobody's that stupid.

290
00:39:32.138 --> 00:39:35.141
When you understand
the nature of a thing...

291
00:39:35.225 --> 00:39:37.143
You know what it's capable of.

292
00:39:55.203 --> 00:39:58.581
- It's Krieger. I'm at 16009.
- Man: Yes?

293
00:39:58.665 --> 00:40:01.626
- Krieger: Get me Pearl.
- Pearl is feeding.

294
00:40:04.462 --> 00:40:08.800
I got a delivery from frost here
and I just had a run-in with blade.

295
00:40:14.055 --> 00:40:16.558
We've gotta clear out
that clinic on hillburn now.

296
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:41.749
Blade: Looks like we hit pay dirt.
That's a vampire Mark.

297
00:40:41.833 --> 00:40:44.586
It means there's a safe house
around here somewhere.

298
00:40:44.669 --> 00:40:47.881
A place they can go if dawn is coming.

299
00:40:47.964 --> 00:40:51.551
See the valets over there?
They're vampires.

300
00:40:51.634 --> 00:40:54.303
So is the doorman.

301
00:40:54.387 --> 00:40:56.598
And the whore on the corner.

302
00:40:57.974 --> 00:41:01.436
- How can you tell?
- Blade: By the way they move.

303
00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:03.730
The way they smell.

304
00:41:06.858 --> 00:41:08.526
Karen: It's like a bad dream.

305
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.195
There's worse things out tonight
than vampires.

306
00:41:11.279 --> 00:41:14.657
- Like what?
- Like me.

307
00:41:15.783 --> 00:41:17.827
Okay, vampire anatomy 101.

308
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:21.623
Crosses and running water don't do dick,
forget what you've seen in movies.

309
00:41:21.706 --> 00:41:26.002
You use a stake, silver, or sunlight.
You know how to use one of these?

310
00:41:26.085 --> 00:41:30.006
- No, but I damn sure I learn quick.
- Safety's off, round's chambered.

311
00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:33.509
Silver hollow-point filled with garlic.
Aim for the head or the heart.

312
00:41:33.593 --> 00:41:35.637
Anything else is your ass.

313
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.935
Do you have an invitation?

314
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:29.774
Kenji...

315
00:42:45.039 --> 00:42:46.374
Where's the entrance?

316
00:42:46.457 --> 00:42:49.292
I can't tell you that, man, if...

317
00:42:52.296 --> 00:42:55.340
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the entrance?

318
00:42:55.425 --> 00:43:00.555
Okay. Look, it's in the freezer.

319
00:43:09.647 --> 00:43:13.358
Come on, man, I told you!
It's in the fridge!

320
00:43:22.452 --> 00:43:25.038
- Okay.
- You give frost a message from me.

321
00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:28.833
You tell him it's open season
on all suck-heads.

322
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.377
Some kind of archive.

323
00:44:17.173 --> 00:44:19.675
This must be where
they keep most of their records.

324
00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:21.594
Karen: Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

325
00:44:21.677 --> 00:44:25.973
They've got their claws into everything.
Politics, finance, real estate.

326
00:44:26.057 --> 00:44:29.185
They already own half of downtown.

327
00:44:49.205 --> 00:44:52.667
- Man 1: Hey, how's it going?
- Man 2: I'm surprised they were there.

328
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.710
Frost throws a good party.

329
00:44:54.794 --> 00:44:57.880
Yeah, but where is he?

330
00:45:11.936 --> 00:45:13.062
Come on, baby.

331
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.783
Don't keep everyone waiting.

332
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:48.347
Man: Deacon,
there's someone here to see you.

333
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:53.895
Krieger: I gotta talk to you, frost.

334
00:45:54.478 --> 00:45:56.689
I'm sorry. I had to come here.

335
00:45:56.772 --> 00:46:00.902
It's a mistake going to Pearl's.
I know that. Dumb fucking me.

336
00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:03.696
- I know you're disappointed.
- Am I that transparent?

337
00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:05.281
- You wanna meet him?
- Yeah.

338
00:46:05.363 --> 00:46:08.617
I can get you guys in with him,
we're tight. We're like brothers.

339
00:46:09.035 --> 00:46:11.204
Fuck. Frost...

340
00:46:11.287 --> 00:46:12.580
- Hey.
- Yeah.

341
00:46:13.664 --> 00:46:17.210
Deac, deac, I've been telling
these bitches all about you, man.

342
00:46:17.293 --> 00:46:18.878
They've been dying to meet you.

343
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:21.839
They are so psyched,
these badass bitches. I meet them...

344
00:46:21.923 --> 00:46:23.965
- Nice.
- Deac?

345
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.636
Frost, it's about blade.

346
00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:29.054
He's busy.
When he's focused on something...

347
00:46:29.138 --> 00:46:32.808
- He doesn't have time to fuck around.
- Krieger: Frost, this is important.

348
00:46:32.892 --> 00:46:37.021
Blade was waiting for me.
Look, they're using the girl as bait.

349
00:46:37.104 --> 00:46:39.941
- And you were stupid enough to take it.
- Shut up, bitch.

350
00:46:40.024 --> 00:46:43.444
I didn't know he was gonna be there.
It was a trap, see?

351
00:46:43.527 --> 00:46:46.739
But don't worry, it's no problem.
We can still get the girl.

352
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.575
Yeah.

353
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.583
- Whoo!
- Man: Yeah.

354
00:47:00.419 --> 00:47:02.755
Woman 1: Oh, come on.

355
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:06.050
- Oh, yes.
- Woman 2: All right.

356
00:47:18.229 --> 00:47:20.982
Forget the girl. I want blade.

357
00:47:21.065 --> 00:47:22.692
Mercury: I know you do.

358
00:47:22.775 --> 00:47:26.070
Frost: You hear me, Quinn?
I want him alive.

359
00:47:26.153 --> 00:47:27.238
What?

360
00:47:29.991 --> 00:47:33.160
Wait a minute, man.
You want him alive?

361
00:47:36.247 --> 00:47:38.624
Karen: What's that smell?

362
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:43.921
Man: Study the image carefully, frost.

363
00:47:44.005 --> 00:47:48.968
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

364
00:47:49.051 --> 00:47:50.469
Krieger, is that you?

365
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.972
He's here. He's here.

366
00:47:53.055 --> 00:47:55.808
Blade: This must be Pearl,
the record keeper.

367
00:47:57.143 --> 00:47:58.311
He's here.

368
00:47:58.394 --> 00:48:01.939
He's going to kill me.
You need me, frost. You need me.

369
00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:03.899
Pearl, you're history.

370
00:48:03.983 --> 00:48:06.569
Have the good grace
to die with some fucking dignity.

371
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.779
Pearl: Frost,
you useless bloodsucker.

372
00:48:09.864 --> 00:48:13.034
- Frost: Congratulations, blade.
- Frost.

373
00:48:13.117 --> 00:48:15.744
I hear you've been looking for me.
I'm flattered.

374
00:48:15.828 --> 00:48:17.163
It'll pass.

375
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:20.708
Fuck.

376
00:48:23.252 --> 00:48:26.881
- What is that?
- That, biscuit boy, is a uv lamp.

377
00:48:27.423 --> 00:48:29.716
We're gonna play a little game
of 20 questions.

378
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.553
Depending on how you answer,
you may walk out of here with a tan.

379
00:48:33.637 --> 00:48:35.765
What's that?

380
00:48:35.848 --> 00:48:39.352
Oh, that? Oh, it's nothing.
It's routine research.

381
00:48:39.435 --> 00:48:41.896
Actually, it's a video game.

382
00:48:52.865 --> 00:48:54.283
That must have hurt.

383
00:48:54.367 --> 00:48:57.745
- It's a fragment, a piece of the prophecy.
- What prophecy?

384
00:48:57.828 --> 00:49:01.624
Oh, I'm not really sure.
There's so many. How could I...?

385
00:49:16.347 --> 00:49:19.517
And there is nothing you can do about it,
day Walker!

386
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.227
Is that so?

387
00:49:22.228 --> 00:49:24.522
Well, that's what frost says.

388
00:49:24.605 --> 00:49:27.691
Then you won't mind me borrowing this
for a while, will you?

389
00:49:27.775 --> 00:49:30.611
If he moves, fry him.

390
00:49:33.864 --> 00:49:34.949
What's in here?

391
00:49:35.032 --> 00:49:37.785
Nothing. It's a storeroom.
You're wasting your time.

392
00:49:37.868 --> 00:49:39.870
There's nothing of importance
to anyone.

393
00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:43.249
- Then you won't mind if I take a peek.
- No!

394
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:06.981
He moved.

395
00:50:38.554 --> 00:50:40.598
Karen: What is this?

396
00:50:41.682 --> 00:50:44.852
Blade: These are the pages
from the book of erebus.

397
00:50:45.227 --> 00:50:47.605
The vampire Bible.

398
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.524
It contains everything...

399
00:50:52.067 --> 00:50:53.736
Their entire history.

400
00:50:54.904 --> 00:50:58.365
La magra must be one of their legends.

401
00:51:02.328 --> 00:51:03.954
Why is frost so interested
in la magra?

402
00:51:04.038 --> 00:51:06.081
Shh!

403
00:51:43.118 --> 00:51:44.745
Give me your hand.

404
00:51:48.165 --> 00:51:49.333
Quinn: Do you remember me?

405
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:09.061
Give it to him!

406
00:52:25.703 --> 00:52:28.831
Hey. Hey! Nice one.

407
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.876
Well, well, well.
You took my arm, man.

408
00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.714
Remember? But it's cool.

409
00:52:37.631 --> 00:52:39.133
I got a new one.

410
00:52:40.426 --> 00:52:42.428
Think I'll ever play piano again?

411
00:52:44.388 --> 00:52:48.392
You can slice him, you can dice him,
but the Quinn man just keeps on coming.

412
00:52:48.475 --> 00:52:51.895
Check it out. I've got his pig-sticker.

413
00:52:56.317 --> 00:52:57.735
You're a fuckup, crease.

414
00:52:59.069 --> 00:53:02.865
You're a fuckup. "I got his pig-sticker."

415
00:53:03.657 --> 00:53:06.410
You're just full of surprises,
ain't you, chief?

416
00:53:15.002 --> 00:53:17.504
Stay away from me, sweetness...

417
00:53:18.005 --> 00:53:20.758
Because I'm not finished
with you yet.

418
00:53:22.926 --> 00:53:24.345
Lookie here.

419
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.059
Silver. Nice craftsmanship, huh?

420
00:53:30.142 --> 00:53:32.102
Probably cost you a pretty penny.

421
00:53:32.186 --> 00:53:36.482
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

422
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.736
Just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

423
00:53:45.407 --> 00:53:49.328
Come to think of it, blade,
I owe you one.

424
00:53:54.041 --> 00:53:57.086
Actually, if you wanna get technical,
blade...

425
00:53:58.128 --> 00:53:59.380
I owe you two.

426
00:54:03.175 --> 00:54:04.718
What's so funny, bright eyes?

427
00:54:07.888 --> 00:54:09.765
I'm expecting company.

428
00:54:25.322 --> 00:54:27.533
Catch you fuckers at a bad time?

429
00:54:27.616 --> 00:54:28.867
No, no guns!

430
00:54:31.036 --> 00:54:33.789
No, no, no! You idiots!

431
00:54:39.294 --> 00:54:41.672
No, fuck him. Get blade!

432
00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:43.298
You asshole!

433
00:54:43.882 --> 00:54:46.051
- Man 1: Move it!
- Man 2: Hurry up.

434
00:54:49.638 --> 00:54:54.977
Idiots, stop it, now! I need him!
Deac wants blade alive! Go!

435
00:54:59.481 --> 00:55:01.316
Karen: You've been
listening the whole time?

436
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.651
Blade: Radio contact.

437
00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:05.404
Whistler: Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperone?

438
00:55:13.954 --> 00:55:16.582
Christ, I'm too old for this.

439
00:55:16.665 --> 00:55:18.792
Somebody get me
a goddamn wheelchair.

440
00:55:27.217 --> 00:55:29.511
Whistler.

441
00:55:29.595 --> 00:55:32.473
He can take care of himself.
Jump.

442
00:56:53.428 --> 00:56:54.680
What are you gonna do?

443
00:56:56.306 --> 00:56:58.183
Oh, my god.

444
00:57:12.614 --> 00:57:13.699
What's wrong?

445
00:57:16.201 --> 00:57:18.245
It's dislocated.

446
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.498
Let me help you.

447
00:57:33.259 --> 00:57:36.304
- Here, let me give you a hand...
- No. Get away.

448
00:57:52.321 --> 00:57:53.906
You're one of them, aren't you?

449
00:57:56.533 --> 00:58:00.787
No. I'm something else.

450
00:58:07.544 --> 00:58:09.254
Whistler: I found him
when he was 13.

451
00:58:09.338 --> 00:58:13.717
He'd been living on the streets,
feeding off the homeless.

452
00:58:14.176 --> 00:58:17.387
His need for blood
had taken hold at puberty.

453
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:21.099
I took him for a vampire at first.

454
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:23.769
Almost killed him too.

455
00:58:23.852 --> 00:58:26.605
Then I realized what he was.

456
00:58:27.147 --> 00:58:31.109
Blade's mother was attacked by
a vampire while she was pregnant.

457
00:58:31.193 --> 00:58:34.237
She died, but he lived.

458
00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:38.158
Unfortunately,
he'd undergone certain genetic changes.

459
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:43.789
He can withstand garlic, silver,
even sunlight.

460
00:58:43.872 --> 00:58:45.457
And he's got their strength.

461
00:58:47.542 --> 00:58:50.420
This time tomorrow,
all those wounds of his will be healed.

462
00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:54.925
He still ages like a human, though.

463
00:58:55.008 --> 00:58:57.594
See, vampires age slower than us.

464
00:58:58.804 --> 00:59:04.017
Unfortunately,
he also inherited their thirst.

465
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:07.688
Karen: I thought the serum
was supposed to suppress that.

466
00:59:07.771 --> 00:59:10.065
Time's running out.

467
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:14.319
His body's starting to reject it.

468
00:59:14.945 --> 00:59:19.700
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

469
00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:25.288
Why do you hunt them?

470
00:59:27.374 --> 00:59:29.835
I had a family once.

471
00:59:29.918 --> 00:59:33.130
A wife, two daughters.

472
00:59:34.965 --> 00:59:38.677
Then a drifter came calling one evening.
A vampire.

473
00:59:40.679 --> 00:59:42.472
He toyed with them first.

474
00:59:43.348 --> 00:59:47.269
Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

475
00:59:50.981 --> 00:59:55.902
We kill as many of them as we can find,
but it's getting worse.

476
00:59:55.986 --> 00:59:57.320
Because of frost.

477
00:59:57.404 --> 01:00:00.907
There's something happening
in the vampire ranks.

478
01:00:00.991 --> 01:00:03.200
It's something big.

479
01:00:03.493 --> 01:00:07.914
And I'd stake my life
that son of a bitch is at the center of it.

480
01:00:11.501 --> 01:00:13.545
Karen: Blade?

481
01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.398
Whistler told me what happened.

482
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:38.945
He told me what you are.

483
01:00:41.698 --> 01:00:43.950
You don't know me.

484
01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:46.870
You don't know anything about me.

485
01:00:49.206 --> 01:00:51.249
I'm not human.

486
01:00:54.544 --> 01:00:55.629
You look human to me...

487
01:00:55.712 --> 01:00:58.590
Humans don't drink blood.

488
01:00:58.673 --> 01:01:01.134
That was a long time ago.

489
01:01:01.968 --> 01:01:04.096
Maybe you should let that go.

490
01:01:06.932 --> 01:01:11.853
I have spent my whole life looking
for that thing that killed my mother...

491
01:01:12.687 --> 01:01:15.607
And made me what I am.

492
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.029
And every time I take one
of those monsters out...

493
01:01:21.113 --> 01:01:24.407
I get a little piece of that life back.

494
01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:28.036
So don't you tell me about forgetting.

495
01:01:31.498 --> 01:01:33.058
Quinn: My fault?
He took us by surprise!

496
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.961
Two of them against
your entire security force?

497
01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:38.338
Don't put that shit on me,
you were there too.

498
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:41.633
I'm sure Deacon will appreciate
our cutback in payroll.

499
01:01:41.716 --> 01:01:45.011
- Quinn: Ow! You little skeez.
- The amputee lifestyle really suits you.

500
01:01:45.095 --> 01:01:47.222
I should put this stump
through that grin.

501
01:01:47.305 --> 01:01:50.809
Face it, angel. You were sloppy.
You got what you deserved.

502
01:01:55.188 --> 01:01:57.148
Quinn: Deac,
let me take this guy out, man.

503
01:01:57.232 --> 01:01:59.734
Look what he fucking did!
He took my hand again!

504
01:01:59.818 --> 01:02:02.571
Listen to me. I want him alive.

505
01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:04.489
Quinn: What the fuck are you talk...?

506
01:02:04.573 --> 01:02:07.826
You want him alive? We've been trying
to kill this motherfucker for years.

507
01:02:07.909 --> 01:02:09.744
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You want...?

508
01:02:09.828 --> 01:02:14.624
Shh. Big guy, relax.

509
01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.042
Be patient.

510
01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:19.171
We got a lot to do here.

511
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.715
I need you, man.

512
01:02:25.677 --> 01:02:28.430
- I need you.
- Yeah.

513
01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:12.974
Frost: Good morning.

514
01:03:13.642 --> 01:03:15.769
How you feeling?

515
01:03:24.486 --> 01:03:26.446
Look at that.

516
01:03:29.324 --> 01:03:32.994
Ooh! Getting a little
toasty out here, huh?

517
01:03:34.412 --> 01:03:38.416
When was the last time you stopped
to appreciate a good sunrise?

518
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.628
That's right, you were born a vampire,
so you never had the pleasure, have you?

519
01:03:42.712 --> 01:03:45.674
That's okay. It's all right.

520
01:03:45.757 --> 01:03:49.052
At least we're here together.
Share the moment.

521
01:03:49.135 --> 01:03:51.805
Which means a lot to me
by the way, really.

522
01:03:51.888 --> 01:03:53.807
I mean that.

523
01:03:55.392 --> 01:03:57.727
Because actually,
when you get to know me...

524
01:03:57.811 --> 01:04:00.689
I'm a fairly sentimental type of guy.

525
01:04:00.772 --> 01:04:03.608
Bit of an innocent, you might say.

526
01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:08.112
Do what you want, frost.

527
01:04:08.446 --> 01:04:10.407
Doesn't make any difference.

528
01:04:11.825 --> 01:04:14.786
You just don't fucking get it.

529
01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:19.124
- You're never gonna be a pureblood.
- Hold him.

530
01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:24.170
Dragonetti: You will never rule us.

531
01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:39.853
Jesus Christ. Have a nice day.

532
01:04:40.562 --> 01:04:43.648
Sorry, you old dog. You just got
a little too long in the teeth.

533
01:04:45.275 --> 01:04:50.030
What, man? That was funny.
"Long, tooth." It's funny, man.

534
01:04:50.113 --> 01:04:52.657
Did I tell you the one
about the leprechaun...?

535
01:05:21.478 --> 01:05:24.064
What have you done with dragonetti?

536
01:05:30.653 --> 01:05:33.156
Let's get down to business, shall we?

537
01:05:33.239 --> 01:05:36.159
I need 12 volunteers.

538
01:05:42.749 --> 01:05:44.626
Blade: Whistler.

539
01:05:47.087 --> 01:05:48.380
Whistler: What is this?

540
01:05:50.006 --> 01:05:52.634
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

541
01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:54.219
I took it from the archives.

542
01:05:54.302 --> 01:05:57.182
- Whistler: It's written in blood.
- Blade: It's from the book of erebus.

543
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.939
I think it's what frost
has been working on.

544
01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:09.484
Whistler: It's something about
the blood god, the spirits of the 12.

545
01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:12.028
I don't know.
I can't make out the rest of it.

546
01:06:12.112 --> 01:06:13.696
Well, maybe this'll help.

547
01:06:14.614 --> 01:06:16.908
We'll figure out something.

548
01:06:17.617 --> 01:06:19.202
Blade: So, what's all of this?

549
01:06:19.285 --> 01:06:23.790
Took a trip to the hospital last night,
borrowed some equipment.

550
01:06:24.082 --> 01:06:26.751
For your miracle cure?

551
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.214
Karen: This is edta.
It's an anticoagulant.

552
01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:33.425
We use it to treat blood clots.

553
01:06:34.467 --> 01:06:38.763
Look what happens when I introduce it
onto a sample of vampire blood.

554
01:06:40.473 --> 01:06:42.475
Take a step back.

555
01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:45.311
The reaction's energetic.

556
01:06:53.736 --> 01:06:57.782
- Some cure.
- Karen: I didn't say edta was a cure.

557
01:06:57.866 --> 01:07:02.412
But maybe you could use it
to explode some vampire heads.

558
01:07:04.372 --> 01:07:07.167
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.

559
01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.879
Later. I gotta go downtown.

560
01:07:10.962 --> 01:07:13.756
- I need some serum.
- Whistler: Serum can wait.

561
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.259
This is important.

562
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.241
- Is he sick?
- Cancer.

563
01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:45.705
You have a lot of love for him,
don't you?

564
01:07:45.788 --> 01:07:50.793
We have a good arrangement.
He makes the weapons, I use them.

565
01:07:54.714 --> 01:07:59.219
You know, my mother used to say,
"a cold heart is a dead heart."

566
01:08:16.986 --> 01:08:19.364
You don't look so good.

567
01:08:19.948 --> 01:08:25.453
I'm just a little tired.
You know, we've been working all night.

568
01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:30.500
I guess we didn't catch it in time.

569
01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:35.672
You got another day, two at the most.

570
01:08:39.467 --> 01:08:41.760
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

571
01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:45.848
You make it sound like
I'm already dead.

572
01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:05.493
Frost: Blade.

573
01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:31.185
How you doing, chief?

574
01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:34.397
Easy.

575
01:09:35.356 --> 01:09:37.275
Wouldn't want our little friend here...

576
01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:40.111
To wind up on the back
of a milk carton, would we?

577
01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:47.160
It's nice to finally meet you, man.
Had my eye on you for years.

578
01:09:47.243 --> 01:09:52.290
I know all about you.
Your serum, whistler, everything.

579
01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.334
Sunblock.

580
01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.794
Hey, it's a start, right?

581
01:09:56.878 --> 01:10:00.506
The goal, of course, is to be like you.
A day Walker.

582
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:04.177
You got the best of both worlds,
don't you?

583
01:10:05.136 --> 01:10:08.222
All our strengths,
none of our weaknesses.

584
01:10:09.015 --> 01:10:11.392
Well, maybe I don't see it that way.

585
01:10:11.476 --> 01:10:14.437
Oh, so it's back to pretending
we're human again?

586
01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.149
Come on.
Spare me the uncle Tom routine, okay?

587
01:10:18.232 --> 01:10:21.361
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

588
01:10:22.153 --> 01:10:26.407
You think the humans will ever accept
a half-breed like you? They can't.

589
01:10:26.491 --> 01:10:28.701
They're afraid of you.

590
01:10:28.785 --> 01:10:31.579
And they should be.
You're an animal.

591
01:10:31.663 --> 01:10:33.581
You're a fucking maniac.

592
01:10:37.335 --> 01:10:40.463
Look at them. They're cattle.

593
01:10:40.546 --> 01:10:42.465
Pieces of meat.

594
01:10:42.548 --> 01:10:45.426
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

595
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.806
Plague, war, famine.

596
01:10:49.889 --> 01:10:53.184
Morality doesn't even enter into it.

597
01:10:53.267 --> 01:10:58.189
We're just a function of natural
selection, man. The new race.

598
01:10:58.898 --> 01:11:01.359
Looks like your mascara's running.

599
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:12.537
I'm offering you a truce.
I want you with us.

600
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.415
What, do you think I'm stupid?

601
01:11:23.297 --> 01:11:25.174
You're familiar with the blood god.

602
01:11:25.258 --> 01:11:27.510
Frost...

603
01:11:27.927 --> 01:11:30.555
You're nothing to me...

604
01:11:30.638 --> 01:11:33.599
But another dead vampire.

605
01:11:33.683 --> 01:11:36.352
You're an idiot, you know that?

606
01:11:36.436 --> 01:11:38.813
I came down here
offering you an easy way out...

607
01:11:38.896 --> 01:11:42.150
And you spit it right back
in my fucking face.

608
01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:44.777
Careful.

609
01:11:48.489 --> 01:11:50.783
What do I care?

610
01:11:50.867 --> 01:11:54.996
They're nothing but cattle,
just like you said.

611
01:11:55.538 --> 01:11:58.750
If you wanna take the hard road,
be my guest, pal.

612
01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:01.169
But I promise you,
by the time this is over...

613
01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:04.797
You're gonna wish they never cut you
from your mother's womb.

614
01:12:38.873 --> 01:12:40.166
Go home.

615
01:12:44.086 --> 01:12:46.631
It's simple.
Why do vampires need to drink blood?

616
01:12:46.714 --> 01:12:49.467
Because their own blood
can't sustain hemoglobin.

617
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.553
Right. So it's a genetic defect
just like hemolytic anemia.

618
01:12:52.637 --> 01:12:55.348
That means that we have to treat it
with gene therapy.

619
01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:59.060
Rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

620
01:12:59.143 --> 01:13:01.312
They've been using it
on sickle-cell anemia.

621
01:13:01.395 --> 01:13:02.688
Are you sure that's safe?

622
01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:07.026
I have no idea,
but I don't have a choice, do I?

623
01:13:09.195 --> 01:13:11.030
You actually think this could work?

624
01:13:11.113 --> 01:13:14.909
On me? Yes.

625
01:13:15.159 --> 01:13:17.036
On blade, I'm not so sure.

626
01:13:17.119 --> 01:13:20.623
See, he didn't contract vampirism
from a bite like I did.

627
01:13:20.706 --> 01:13:24.544
He was born with it.
It's part of his DNA.

628
01:13:25.628 --> 01:13:29.173
I'm sure I can cure his thirst,
but it's gonna take time.

629
01:13:29.257 --> 01:13:31.801
We're out of time.

630
01:13:31.884 --> 01:13:34.720
You saw what was on that disk.

631
01:13:39.308 --> 01:13:41.227
Damn.

632
01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:43.771
Get out of here.

633
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.423
I said, get out of here.

634
01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:19.932
Nice place. Took us a while to find it.

635
01:14:28.232 --> 01:14:31.027
- Bite me and get it over with.
- I ain't gonna bite you.

636
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.584
Do your thing.

637
01:14:58.387 --> 01:15:00.264
Whistler?

638
01:16:07.289 --> 01:16:09.125
Frost took her.

639
01:16:16.924 --> 01:16:19.093
Listen to me.

640
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.597
The disk...

641
01:16:23.848 --> 01:16:25.433
We decoded it.

642
01:16:25.933 --> 01:16:32.189
Frost is trying to trigger
a fucking vampire apocalypse.

643
01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.736
There's some kind of...

644
01:16:37.028 --> 01:16:40.906
Vampire god he's trying to resurrect.

645
01:16:41.699 --> 01:16:43.159
La magra.

646
01:16:46.704 --> 01:16:49.123
You're the key.

647
01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:51.625
He needs your blood.

648
01:16:55.379 --> 01:16:58.174
The blood of the day Walker.

649
01:17:00.468 --> 01:17:02.720
You're the chosen one.

650
01:17:06.307 --> 01:17:08.642
Listen to me, blade.

651
01:17:09.477 --> 01:17:12.813
- You can't go after him.
- Bullshit.

652
01:17:12.897 --> 01:17:18.235
If frost gets his hands on you,
it's all over.

653
01:17:20.529 --> 01:17:23.616
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

654
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:28.037
Shit.

655
01:17:31.957 --> 01:17:33.667
You're gonna have to finish me off.

656
01:17:35.336 --> 01:17:37.963
Don't want me coming back.

657
01:17:39.298 --> 01:17:40.883
We can treat the wounds.

658
01:17:42.676 --> 01:17:44.261
It's too far gone.

659
01:17:45.179 --> 01:17:47.556
You know that.

660
01:17:50.267 --> 01:17:52.436
Give me your gun.

661
01:17:54.313 --> 01:17:55.647
No.

662
01:17:57.024 --> 01:17:59.360
Give me the goddamn gun.

663
01:18:24.468 --> 01:18:28.138
Now walk away,
you stupid son of a bitch.

664
01:18:32.977 --> 01:18:35.312
Walk the fuck away.

665
01:18:56.416 --> 01:19:00.044
By the time you watch this,
your friend whistler should be dead.

666
01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:03.382
If it makes any difference to you,
he put up quite a fight.

667
01:19:03.674 --> 01:19:06.760
You can find us
at the edgewood towers.

668
01:20:44.358 --> 01:20:46.819
You seem a bit tense.

669
01:20:46.902 --> 01:20:50.197
A bit pent-up maybe,
like you need to release something.

670
01:20:51.782 --> 01:20:57.037
No?
Blade not... giving it to you maybe?

671
01:20:58.289 --> 01:21:00.249
I don't know, I just...

672
01:21:00.791 --> 01:21:03.460
I see such a beautiful woman.

673
01:21:04.378 --> 01:21:06.630
Great skin.

674
01:21:08.507 --> 01:21:10.384
I'd like to see you happy, that's all.

675
01:21:10.467 --> 01:21:14.513
Is this the part
where you offer to turn me?

676
01:21:15.264 --> 01:21:17.725
Well, it's either that or a body bag.

677
01:21:18.225 --> 01:21:21.020
Go ahead. Bite me.

678
01:21:21.854 --> 01:21:24.064
I'll just cure myself.

679
01:21:24.148 --> 01:21:27.234
I did it before, and I can do it again.

680
01:21:27.318 --> 01:21:31.363
- There is no cure, baby.
- There is if you've been bitten.

681
01:21:31.739 --> 01:21:34.033
If you were once human.

682
01:21:39.455 --> 01:21:41.999
How'd you get that scar, Deacon?

683
01:21:42.082 --> 01:21:45.252
A born vampire would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

684
01:21:45.336 --> 01:21:48.422
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

685
01:21:49.256 --> 01:21:50.966
Isn't that right?

686
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:53.676
Vampires like you aren't a species.

687
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:58.097
You're just infected, a virus,
a sexually-transmitted disease...

688
01:21:58.182 --> 01:22:00.392
I'll tell you what we are, sister.

689
01:22:00.476 --> 01:22:04.021
We're the top of the fucking food chain.
The blood god's coming...

690
01:22:04.104 --> 01:22:08.025
And after tonight,
you people are fucking history.

691
01:22:08.108 --> 01:22:11.820
He's a hurricane, an act of god.

692
01:22:11.904 --> 01:22:14.531
Anyone caught in his path
will instantly be turned.

693
01:22:16.575 --> 01:22:18.452
Everyone you've ever known...

694
01:22:18.535 --> 01:22:21.914
Everyone you've ever fucking loved.

695
01:22:21.997 --> 01:22:25.334
It won't matter who's pureblood
and who's not.

696
01:22:26.043 --> 01:22:28.962
How you gonna cure
the whole fucking world?

697
01:22:34.675 --> 01:22:37.053
And blade's blood is the key.

698
01:22:37.429 --> 01:22:38.847
We've got an intruder.

699
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:10.504
I don't think you understand.
This dude is bad.

700
01:23:10.587 --> 01:23:12.714
He had 20 guys around him...
I was there.

701
01:23:12.798 --> 01:23:15.551
- He's got shit he throws...
- He's got the sword and shit.

702
01:23:15.634 --> 01:23:19.179
Yeah, he can throw it in the air,
catch it underneath. Shut the fuck up!

703
01:23:19.263 --> 01:23:21.598
Man: There's no
entrance or exits where we are.

704
01:23:21.682 --> 01:23:23.809
Make it happen, all right?
It's one guy on foot.

705
01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:29.189
Get him! Get him! Go!

706
01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:30.649
That's him, get him!

707
01:23:50.002 --> 01:23:52.713
Why am I hearing gunfire? Huh?

708
01:23:52.796 --> 01:23:55.883
Did I tell anybody to start shooting?
I need him alive.

709
01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:58.385
Man 1:

710
01:24:00.262 --> 01:24:03.182
Please. I just work for them.

711
01:24:05.726 --> 01:24:08.395
- Jesus Christ. Lock this place down.
- Man 2: Yes, sir.

712
01:25:56.044 --> 01:25:57.462
Eric?

713
01:26:09.057 --> 01:26:10.183
But you died.

714
01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:15.271
I came back, Eric.
That very same night.

715
01:26:17.316 --> 01:26:20.777
And Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

716
01:26:36.543 --> 01:26:38.712
Jesus Christ.
I thought you'd be happy.

717
01:26:40.714 --> 01:26:44.051
You're finally being reunited
with your mother, and you act like this?

718
01:26:44.718 --> 01:26:46.595
Blade, give it up. It's over.

719
01:26:47.095 --> 01:26:49.598
She belongs to me, buddy.

720
01:26:51.808 --> 01:26:53.185
Don't look so surprised.

721
01:26:54.519 --> 01:26:58.023
You spent your whole life looking
for the vampire who bit your mother.

722
01:26:58.106 --> 01:26:59.983
Well, here I am.

723
01:27:02.736 --> 01:27:06.114
Who would have ever guessed
you'd survive your mother's death?

724
01:27:06.198 --> 01:27:09.159
But you did, and here we are...

725
01:27:09.242 --> 01:27:11.411
One big happy fucking family.

726
01:27:23.298 --> 01:27:25.759
I need my serum.

727
01:27:27.594 --> 01:27:30.931
Maybe when we get out of this,
I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

728
01:27:31.014 --> 01:27:32.641
Karen: There's one catch.

729
01:27:37.062 --> 01:27:38.438
If it works...

730
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:44.027
You'll lose your strength
and your ability to regenerate.

731
01:27:44.568 --> 01:27:47.279
You'll be completely human.

732
01:28:24.693 --> 01:28:27.821
Come here. Get up, damn it.

733
01:28:49.092 --> 01:28:52.763
Frost: Blade, Karen,
glad you could make it.

734
01:28:52.846 --> 01:28:56.349
Hey, man. Thanks for the shades.

735
01:28:57.767 --> 01:29:02.062
Our ancestors called this place
the temple of eternal night.

736
01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.443
Nice, isn't it?

737
01:29:06.526 --> 01:29:10.071
Apparently,
these geniuses forgot it ever existed.

738
01:29:10.155 --> 01:29:12.365
Fortunately for us...

739
01:29:12.449 --> 01:29:17.120
I'm what you might call
a student of history.

740
01:29:30.008 --> 01:29:31.968
Why are we here?

741
01:29:34.345 --> 01:29:37.848
This temple was built
for one glorious moment:

742
01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:42.270
This night, for the blood god.

743
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:51.947
Thanks.

744
01:29:56.076 --> 01:29:58.620
Let's see this sword of yours.

745
01:30:02.958 --> 01:30:05.877
Titanium, right? Acid-etched?

746
01:30:08.338 --> 01:30:10.257
I could get used to a weapon like this.

747
01:30:16.388 --> 01:30:19.975
What? You look surprised.

748
01:30:20.934 --> 01:30:23.854
I told you, blade,
I know everything about you.

749
01:30:25.146 --> 01:30:26.398
Hold out your arm, Quinn.

750
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:28.817
Why, man?
Because they're, like, all better.

751
01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.237
Hold out your arm. Now.

752
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:36.825
Quinn: Deac, I...

753
01:30:41.496 --> 01:30:43.081
Just kidding.

754
01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.420
He was fucking with me, man.
He was, like, fucking with me.

755
01:30:48.503 --> 01:30:50.213
Blade.

756
01:30:51.006 --> 01:30:53.133
- Blade.
- He can't hear you, honey.

757
01:30:53.216 --> 01:30:55.719
The thirst has got him now.

758
01:31:01.433 --> 01:31:02.642
What do we have here?

759
01:31:03.393 --> 01:31:05.353
The precious serum.

760
01:31:07.522 --> 01:31:12.068
How long's it been since you shot up?
Twelve, 13 hours maybe?

761
01:31:12.485 --> 01:31:15.572
I bet you're just dying for a drink,
aren't you?

762
01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:20.452
What's it feel like?

763
01:31:21.369 --> 01:31:23.204
Is your blood on fire?

764
01:31:23.872 --> 01:31:25.874
Try some.

765
01:31:26.207 --> 01:31:28.460
You might like it.

766
01:31:28.543 --> 01:31:31.004
Thanks, but I prefer the real thing.

767
01:31:32.047 --> 01:31:36.509
In any event, I don't think
you'll be needing these anymore.

768
01:31:43.266 --> 01:31:47.270
It's a shame, you know?
When I think of what you've become...

769
01:31:48.146 --> 01:31:50.065
What you should have become.

770
01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.902
I guess I don't blame you. I mean,
with everything that's happened...

771
01:31:53.985 --> 01:31:57.113
It's the human side of you
that's made you weak.

772
01:31:57.197 --> 01:32:01.326
- You should've listened to your blood.
- You can say what you want...

773
01:32:01.409 --> 01:32:04.329
But I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

774
01:32:04.412 --> 01:32:06.039
Ooh.

775
01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:10.209
Get him out of here.

776
01:32:14.631 --> 01:32:17.050
Get these fucks downstairs. Now.

777
01:32:17.133 --> 01:32:20.595
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on, now.

778
01:32:21.137 --> 01:32:22.430
Man: Come on.

779
01:32:25.141 --> 01:32:27.978
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We haven't forgotten about you.

780
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:32.857
Oh, no, baby. We got something
real special planned for you.

781
01:32:32.941 --> 01:32:35.860
Quinn: Found me a surfer boy
with a nice ass and I sucked him dry.

782
01:32:35.944 --> 01:32:39.113
- And you'd figure he'd turn, right?
- But he didn't turn, did he?

783
01:32:39.197 --> 01:32:43.576
No, he turned into some kind of zombie.
It happens sometimes, cutie.

784
01:32:44.244 --> 01:32:46.955
- Quinn: He was fucking tripped out.
- Frost: Pathetic.

785
01:32:47.038 --> 01:32:49.916
Quinn: These guys are complete scum,
man. They'll eat anything.

786
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.795
Animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

787
01:32:55.213 --> 01:32:56.673
They'll even eat vampires.

788
01:32:56.756 --> 01:32:58.091
That's a plus.

789
01:32:58.174 --> 01:33:02.345
And bearing that all in mind, I'd like
you to meet an old friend of yours.

790
01:33:07.642 --> 01:33:11.438
It's too bad. I kind of liked her.

791
01:33:12.105 --> 01:33:14.232
What a waste.

792
01:33:34.627 --> 01:33:37.547
Curtis: I don't know
what's happening to me.

793
01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:39.466
No pulse.

794
01:33:39.549 --> 01:33:42.719
And, of course,
there's the question of lividity.

795
01:33:44.387 --> 01:33:45.555
Guns?

796
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.812
Karen?

797
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:55.023
Karen.

798
01:33:55.106 --> 01:33:57.984
I never thought
I would see you again.

799
01:33:58.068 --> 01:34:01.488
Tell me, Karen, do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

800
01:34:20.006 --> 01:34:21.549
Karen.

801
01:34:21.925 --> 01:34:23.802
Karen.

802
01:34:23.885 --> 01:34:25.303
Karen!

803
01:34:26.596 --> 01:34:29.057
Karen!

804
01:34:29.724 --> 01:34:30.850
Karen!

805
01:34:31.392 --> 01:34:32.936
Karen!

806
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:40.295
You poor child.

807
01:35:41.504 --> 01:35:43.798
You're so sick.

808
01:35:44.424 --> 01:35:46.885
So thirsty.

809
01:35:46.968 --> 01:35:49.637
Don't touch me.

810
01:35:51.431 --> 01:35:54.684
Eric, look at me.

811
01:35:54.933 --> 01:35:59.396
Vampires are my people now.
I'm one of them.

812
01:35:59.772 --> 01:36:01.941
Can't be.

813
01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:05.111
Yes, it can.

814
01:36:07.238 --> 01:36:10.157
Try to understand, Eric.

815
01:36:10.992 --> 01:36:14.537
Your mother died a long time ago.

816
01:36:16.122 --> 01:36:18.374
I've hunted.

817
01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:21.377
I've killed.

818
01:36:23.171 --> 01:36:25.672
And I've enjoyed it.

819
01:36:26.216 --> 01:36:28.343
Haven't you?

820
01:36:29.135 --> 01:36:31.679
I know you have.

821
01:36:33.306 --> 01:36:37.560
Sooner or later, the thirst always wins.

822
01:37:21.562 --> 01:37:23.314
Come on.

823
01:37:29.237 --> 01:37:30.321
Spread them out.

824
01:37:31.364 --> 01:37:34.367
One on each glyph, under the tombs.

825
01:37:34.867 --> 01:37:36.202
Make it perfect.

826
01:38:17.284 --> 01:38:18.493
Frost: Bring the elevator up.

827
01:38:58.451 --> 01:39:00.370
Man: You stupid girl.

828
01:39:00.453 --> 01:39:04.040
What do you think is going to happen?
La magra? The blood god?

829
01:39:04.123 --> 01:39:07.418
That's nothing more than a fairy tale
for pretty little vampires.

830
01:39:07.502 --> 01:39:10.421
Then why are you sweating,
pureblood?

831
01:39:10.505 --> 01:39:13.091
Are you afraid
we're gonna steal your soul?

832
01:39:13.174 --> 01:39:15.635
Your pureblood spirit?

833
01:39:16.427 --> 01:39:19.305
You should be. Read the prophecy.

834
01:39:19.389 --> 01:39:22.600
It's time you fucks contributed
something to the cause.

835
01:39:26.813 --> 01:39:31.484
Even if frost is right,
you really think he cares about you?

836
01:39:31.567 --> 01:39:34.779
You're gonna die
just like the rest of us.

837
01:39:59.762 --> 01:40:01.722
Blade.

838
01:40:10.857 --> 01:40:13.651
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

839
01:40:14.068 --> 01:40:15.945
No more compromises.

840
01:40:16.028 --> 01:40:17.488
We're gonna be gods.

841
01:40:19.073 --> 01:40:22.452
- Of course we are.
- Yeah.

842
01:40:23.744 --> 01:40:28.624
I'm gonna be naughty.
I'm gonna be a naughty vampire god.

843
01:40:31.878 --> 01:40:33.379
I'm right here.

844
01:40:36.507 --> 01:40:38.676
Gotta stop...

845
01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:42.180
- Stop the...
- Save your strength.

846
01:40:42.263 --> 01:40:44.098
Flow.

847
01:40:45.349 --> 01:40:48.269
You're hypovolemic.
You're bleeding to death.

848
01:40:48.852 --> 01:40:51.771
Need serum.

849
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.584
Blade.

850
01:41:12.627 --> 01:41:14.253
Blade.

851
01:41:16.547 --> 01:41:18.549
Listen to me.

852
01:41:19.675 --> 01:41:22.512
I want you to take some of my blood.

853
01:41:23.721 --> 01:41:25.765
No.

854
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.268
No.

855
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.938
Look, just do it.

856
01:41:57.588 --> 01:41:59.131
Is everybody thirsty?

857
01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:03.010
I hope you're all very fucking thirsty.

858
01:42:22.196 --> 01:42:25.324
Karen: Oh, please. Please, stop.

859
01:42:28.119 --> 01:42:29.954
Stop.

860
01:42:32.415 --> 01:42:33.499
Oh, god.

861
01:42:34.834 --> 01:42:36.919
Don't stop.

862
01:42:50.516 --> 01:42:52.768
Don't stop.

863
01:42:56.314 --> 01:42:58.149
Oh, god.

864
01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.363
How was it?

865
01:44:56.517 --> 01:45:00.855
Eric, I'm your mother.

866
01:45:02.773 --> 01:45:04.984
You wouldn't hurt your mother...

867
01:45:05.443 --> 01:45:07.319
Would you?

868
01:45:09.238 --> 01:45:11.157
Come here.

869
01:45:11.949 --> 01:45:14.118
It's you and me.

870
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:17.163
I must release you.

871
01:45:28.132 --> 01:45:29.884
Fuck!

872
01:46:33.948 --> 01:46:36.575
- Mercury: Deacon?
- Frost: Not anymore.

873
01:46:52.466 --> 01:46:55.052
Frost.

874
01:46:55.135 --> 01:46:57.930
- Frost: Kill him.
- Wait. I owe you, man.

875
01:46:58.013 --> 01:46:59.640
I got two new hands, blade.

876
01:46:59.723 --> 01:47:02.434
I don't know which one to use
to kill you with.

877
01:47:23.289 --> 01:47:24.331
Frost.

878
01:48:10.085 --> 01:48:11.754
Frost!

879
01:48:46.330 --> 01:48:48.290
I'm really going to enjoy this now.

880
01:49:37.006 --> 01:49:39.091
Frost: Hey, blade.

881
01:49:41.218 --> 01:49:42.428
Let's do this.

882
01:50:33.854 --> 01:50:36.148
What the fuck?

883
01:50:36.565 --> 01:50:38.859
You're too late, blade.

884
01:50:57.586 --> 01:50:59.379
My turn.

885
01:51:25.364 --> 01:51:27.825
Look at you. You're a little bitch.

886
01:51:29.618 --> 01:51:33.080
What, your serum?
Can't help you now, stud.

887
01:51:40.587 --> 01:51:42.631
Nice shot.

888
01:52:13.787 --> 01:52:18.167
Some motherfuckers
are always trying to ice skate uphill.

889
01:52:49.781 --> 01:52:51.366
Karen: Blade.

890
01:52:59.416 --> 01:53:01.752
Let's get out of here.

891
01:53:37.579 --> 01:53:41.667
I need to get back to the lab
if I'm gonna cure you.

892
01:53:42.584 --> 01:53:44.586
It's not over.

893
01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:46.838
You keep your cure.

894
01:53:47.172 --> 01:53:51.718
There's still a war going on,
and I have a job to do.

895
01:53:52.261 --> 01:53:56.890
You wanna help?
Make me a better serum.
