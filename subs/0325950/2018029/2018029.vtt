1
00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.955
Oh, yeah. People try to tell you
it's not a same thing.

2
00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:27.625
But it is. You gotta go.

3
00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.472
Spring training's like real baseball.

4
00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:31.226
You know, like it used to be

5
00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.332
when we're kids growing up.

6
00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.176
Have a seat. You're on deck.

7
00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:37.428
And kids love it.

8
00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:39.913
They can sit up close to meet ball players.

9
00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:42.604
I can see the ballpark from the back patio.

10
00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:45.146
Nice.

11
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.818
Hey, hey, hey, watch what you're doing,
would you? I'm counting here.

12
00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.251
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

13
00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.743
What the hell are you doing?

14
00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.745
- How's it look?
- Not so good.

15
00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:40.229
- It's your suspension.
- What? Again? You...

16
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.130
you just fixed my suspension
three months ago.

17
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.616
Yeah, that was your struts
and your shocks.

18
00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:48.177
This is the, uh, tie bars.

19
00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:50.366
What the hell is a tie bar?

20
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:52.550
It connects your, uh,

21
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.125
steering knuckle to the center link
right there. Can you see that?

22
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.793
Tell him about that noise
your radio keeps making.

23
00:02:58.793 --> 00:03:00.936
That's my music.

24
00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.173
So you think I can drive it?

25
00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:07.761
Oh, not like this.
It's a death trap.

26
00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:15.426
What do you think?

27
00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:20.839
Well, that death trap thing
sort of concerns me.

28
00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.382
I think he's yanking my chain.

29
00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:23.606
I mean, what am I going to do?

30
00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:25.311
I can't fix this myself.

31
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:27.775
Maybe I can take a look at it.

32
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:30.805
I'm, I'm pretty handy.

33
00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:35.364
Remember that one time?

34
00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:38.772
Norm, you win. How much?

35
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.761
$900?

36
00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:42.958
Where the hell am I
supposed to get $900?

37
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.603
I haven't even seen a check
from my ex in four months.

38
00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:47.534
How are we going to get home?

39
00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:49.132
Well, I guess we're going
to have to walk.

40
00:03:49.132 --> 00:03:51.014
We could call a taxi.

41
00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:52.330
Taxis cost money.

42
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.124
- Are you going to pay for it?
- I guess we'll walk.

43
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.262
- Ah.
- Whoa.

44
00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:03.760
Uh, excuse me. Adrian Monk?

45
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.315
- Yes.
- I'm Tony Lucarelli.

46
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.886
This is Vince, my, uh...

47
00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:10.355
Associate.

48
00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:12.658
My associate.

49
00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:14.473
Look, if it's not too inconvenient,

50
00:04:14.473 --> 00:04:17.871
my uncle would like to talk
to you about a possible job.

51
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:21.073
- A job?
- Uh, Lucarelli...

52
00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:24.796
as in Salvatore Lucarelli?

53
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:26.232
You've heard of him.

54
00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.786
That'll make his day.

55
00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:31.698
No, thank you. Um...

56
00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:33.793
Oh, oh.

57
00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:37.039
It's, is that the right time?

58
00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.456
We're already late.

59
00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.454
Uh, we've got, we've got that bris.

60
00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.418
Whoa. Whoa.
This is a job.

61
00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:44.637
We can't afford to walk away.

62
00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:46.820
We can't afford not to.

63
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.235
Sharona, Sal Lucarelli
is the boss of bosses.

64
00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:54.301
He's the, he's the
West Coast godfather.

65
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.149
- So what?
- So what?

66
00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:57.324
You'd take their money?

67
00:04:57.324 --> 00:05:00.861
People who have 110,000 miles
on their car can't be picky.

68
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:03.746
Fine. Fine.
You go talk to him.

69
00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:06.310
I'll meet you back at the house.

70
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.896
Mr. Monk...

71
00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:15.289
you want my advice, I'd
listen to your friend here.

72
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.477
She's as smart as she is pretty.

73
00:05:18.477 --> 00:05:21.296
It'll only take 20 minutes.

74
00:05:21.296 --> 00:05:24.961
I'm saying please.

75
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:26.495
All right, pretty please.

76
00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:28.935
With a cherry on top?

77
00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:31.694
With a cherry on top.

78
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:35.104
- Vince.
- Come on.

79
00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:37.137
Uh, no, not, not,
not in the back seat.

80
00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.528
Wait, wait, wait, Vince, he
has a thing about back seats.

81
00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:42.273
Everybody sits in the back.

82
00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:44.030
Uh, Mr., Mr. Monk.

83
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.943
You can ride in the
front with Vince.

84
00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:50.129
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

85
00:05:56.257 --> 00:06:00.412
Well, I guess that just leaves
you in the back seat with me.

86
00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:04.425
- Are you scared?
- Are you?

87
00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:05.443
Mr. Monk, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

88
00:07:05.443 --> 00:07:07.448
It means the world to me.

89
00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:14.110
Oh, he does this all the time.

90
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.565
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

91
00:07:15.565 --> 00:07:19.208
I understand.
I got blood on my hands.

92
00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:21.087
Yes, you do.

93
00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:25.343
I'm supposed to be in Pebble Beach.

94
00:07:25.343 --> 00:07:29.257
Instead I'm here preparing for a wake.

95
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.597
Did Fat Tony tell you about the job?

96
00:07:32.922 --> 00:07:36.392
My sister's boy Ernie got killed yesterday,

97
00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:38.754
plus four of my friends. Good friends.

98
00:07:38.754 --> 00:07:40.464
Barbershop massacre, right?

99
00:07:40.464 --> 00:07:42.932
Yeah, massacre, That's the word.

100
00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:44.576
I checked around, Mr. Monk

101
00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:47.736
and other detectives, good detectives
told me you were the best.

102
00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:49.018
Called you a legend.

103
00:07:49.018 --> 00:07:52.769
I'll pay you three times your usual fee
if you tell me who's behind this.

104
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.195
Oh.

105
00:07:56.195 --> 00:07:57.753
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.825
I, I... I can't help you.

107
00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:05.430
Can't or won't?

108
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:10.299
My family is hurt, Mr. Monk.
And angry.

109
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.186
I understand how you feel
more than you know.

110
00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:14.620
They're screaming for vengeance.

111
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.886
They want me to strike out at one of
the Chinese gangs or the Russians.

112
00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.214
I don't want to make a mistake.

113
00:08:20.214 --> 00:08:22.752
I'm trying to prevent a bloodbath here.

114
00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:29.304
Mm. I'm sorry.

115
00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:33.311
I'm very...
very, very, very sorry.

116
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.275
I'm very, very, very sorry.

117
00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:39.938
You know, why don't we just sleep on it?
Then maybe Mr. Monk will reconsider.

118
00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:42.386
Yeah, Fat Tony's right.

119
00:08:42.386 --> 00:08:44.569
Let's all think about it.

120
00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:50.744
Oh, Mr. Monk...

121
00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:53.315
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

122
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:55.292
I'm right-handed.

123
00:08:55.827 --> 00:09:01.931
But I, I use my left hand, too.
Almost every day.

124
00:09:01.931 --> 00:09:04.336
Yeah, you used your left
hand this morning.

125
00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:06.060
Right. That's right.

126
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.903
I'm ambidextrous, really.

127
00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:12.824
Yeah, well, why don't you
think about that, too?

128
00:09:12.824 --> 00:09:15.751
This conversation is over.

129
00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:18.458
Oh, he's a charmer.

130
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.911
- Sharona?
- I'll be right there.

131
00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:26.921
I love you both.

132
00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:30.490
I'd never let anything happen to you.

133
00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:35.636
- I, I love both my hands.
- Good.

134
00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:39.188
Even though I don't use
my left hand as much,

135
00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:42.932
- I, I still love it.
- Okay.

136
00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:48.280
- Let's try a different restaurant.
- Thank you.

137
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.356
It was great talking to you.
I feel better.

138
00:09:57.737 --> 00:09:58.835
Agent Colmes.

139
00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:00.425
Mr. Monk, how are you?
Get in the van.

140
00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:04.344
- I'm, I'm waiting for Sharona.
- Well, you can wait in the van.

141
00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:06.579
- She won't know where I am.
- Oh, we'll tell her.

142
00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:07.996
Just get in the van, please.
Don't make me say it again.

143
00:10:07.996 --> 00:10:10.045
I can't, uh, I, I can't sit in the back.

144
00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:11.044
There's no other seat.

145
00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.011
Really, I am not playing
favorites here.

146
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:17.054
I, I just told the mafia, the, the
same thing. You can ask them.

147
00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:18.807
Yeah, that's really adorable.
In the van now. Get in the van.

148
00:10:18.807 --> 00:10:20.712
I'm getting in, I'm getting in,
I'm getting in.

149
00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:23.189
Look, just for the record,
I'm, I'm using my left hand.

150
00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:26.408
That's fascinating.
Get in the van.

151
00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:31.948
The government can't help but wonder

152
00:10:31.948 --> 00:10:35.074
what you were doing with Salvatore Lucarelli
and his underboss Fat Tony.

153
00:10:35.074 --> 00:10:38.515
Excuse me.
Why do they call him Fat Tony?

154
00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:41.517
Uh, because he used to weigh 250 pounds.

155
00:10:42.223 --> 00:10:45.985
Oh, my God.
Is this the same guy? / Mm.

156
00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:47.719
Now, the Lucarelli family's been under

157
00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:50.909
surveillance by a joint ATF/FBI
task force for the last three months.

158
00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.209
- Is this the barbershop?
- That is right.

159
00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:55.408
That was taken a week ago,
right before the massacre.

160
00:10:55.408 --> 00:10:56.718
Now, had we stayed
there one more day,

161
00:10:56.718 --> 00:10:58.412
we would have been able to see
the whole thing go down.

162
00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:00.381
Excuse me.
What does he weigh now?

163
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:01.838
Okay, you know what?
I have no idea.

164
00:11:01.838 --> 00:11:03.970
Mr. Monk, you still haven't
answered my question.

165
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.521
What the hell were
you doing there?

166
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:09.168
Salvatore wanted to hire me.

167
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.836
Well, that's excellent.
What'd you say?

168
00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.695
Well, I told him I'd see
him in hell first.

169
00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:16.612
But not in those exact words.

170
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.143
- We'd like you to take that job.
- No.

171
00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:24.257
No, if I take that job and
I ID the killers,

172
00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:27.472
Salvatore will go ballistic,
and he'll wipe them all out,

173
00:11:27.472 --> 00:11:29.962
and I, I couldn't live with myself.

174
00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:32.552
Mr. Monk, you're ignoring
the big picture here.

175
00:11:32.552 --> 00:11:34.334
This is an incredible opportunity.

176
00:11:34.334 --> 00:11:36.281
No one's ever been inside the family before.

177
00:11:36.281 --> 00:11:39.339
You can get us the evidence that we need
to bring the whole entire family down.

178
00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:42.752
Hey, I showed them my ID downstairs.
I just gotta talk to my friend.

179
00:11:42.752 --> 00:11:44.005
What, are you reaching for your gun?

180
00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:47.256
If you're reaching for your gun,
you'd better pull it or step aside.

181
00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:50.551
Monk. Hey.
Colmes.

182
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:51.927
What do you think you're doing?

183
00:11:51.927 --> 00:11:53.702
Okay, this is a federal operation, captain.

184
00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:55.110
You have no business being here.

185
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.407
Well, neither does he.
What's going on?

186
00:11:57.407 --> 00:12:00.402
They want Adrian to go undercover
in the Lucarelli family.

187
00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:02.163
What's up with this picture
of you and Fat Tony?

188
00:12:02.163 --> 00:12:04.490
Nothing, and don't call him that.

189
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.008
You're defending him?

190
00:12:07.008 --> 00:12:08.958
Why don't you start by telling them

191
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.431
what happened to the last agent
that tried to infiltrate that family?

192
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:13.871
Oh, start by telling them where
they found the body buried.

193
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.530
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Buried?
- Actually, the parts that they found.

194
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.212
Okay, that's a different situation.
That agent's cover was blown.

195
00:12:19.212 --> 00:12:21.841
Monk's been invited in.
They already know he's a cop.

196
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:24.512
- But I'm not a cop.
- Well, you could be...

197
00:12:24.936 --> 00:12:26.940
if you help us out.

198
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.782
What? What?

199
00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:30.852
Hang on. Whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

200
00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:32.398
What do you mean?

201
00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:34.651
Monk, he's playing you.
Just walk away.

202
00:12:34.651 --> 00:12:36.499
No, wait, no.
I want to hear this.

203
00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:38.364
What, what, what are you saying?

204
00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:39.974
What I'm saying is...

205
00:12:39.974 --> 00:12:44.085
is that if you do me this favor...
this one little tiny favor...

206
00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:47.659
I will call the police commissioner
the next time you're up for reinstatement.

207
00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:51.167
Come here.

208
00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:54.328
Monk, I know this son of a bitch.
He's not to be trusted, okay?

209
00:12:54.328 --> 00:12:57.330
You could go get yourself killed,
he would not so much as bat an eye.

210
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.247
He's right.
It's too dangerous.

211
00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:03.685
But what, what if it was you,

212
00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:07.753
and you didn't have this,
and you wanted it back?

213
00:13:11.923 --> 00:13:13.981
I'll do it.

214
00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:18.122
I'm your...
I'm your man.

215
00:13:18.122 --> 00:13:20.320
Good.

216
00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:28.616
There was a witness eating lunch
across the street around 11:45.

217
00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:30.744
He saw three guys walk in here.

218
00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:34.502
They stood here, rat-a-tat-tat,
like fish in a barrel.

219
00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:37.140
Must have been horrible.

220
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.262
This barbershop was being used
by Salvatore and his crew as a front

221
00:13:41.262 --> 00:13:44.504
for a numbers game they were running
out of this back room.

222
00:13:44.504 --> 00:13:48.025
- What's this?
- Your friend Fat Tony, it's his life story.

223
00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:53.106
There was 7 grand on that table.

224
00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:58.533
Two indictments?
That doesn't mean anything.

225
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.697
It means he got lucky.

226
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.272
Look, I know why you're
attracted to him.

227
00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:06.500
I get it.
You think he's dangerous.

228
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.382
Some people think I'm dangerous.

229
00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:12.498
Yeah, people driving behind you.

230
00:14:13.328 --> 00:14:17.411
The ballistic report says,
and special agent Colmes concurs,

231
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:21.529
that all five victims were killed
with the same weapon, an Ingram MAC-10.

232
00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.993
Three killers, but only one gun?

233
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:26.594
Yeah, maybe they took turns.

234
00:14:26.594 --> 00:14:29.718
- The money was still here?
- Yep, 7 grand.

235
00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:31.943
Why wouldn't they just take it?

236
00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:33.990
It wasn't a robbery.

237
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.572
These people don't send e-mails
to each other, Monk.

238
00:14:36.572 --> 00:14:39.159
This is how they send a message.

239
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.364
- What's this?
- From the gumball machine.

240
00:14:43.364 --> 00:14:44.995
The killers must have ripped it out.

241
00:14:44.995 --> 00:14:46.900
Yeah, they used it to break
the window in the back.

242
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.323
That was their only way of escape,

243
00:14:48.323 --> 00:14:50.237
because there were two
uniforms out front.

244
00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:55.495
- Randy.
- Hmm?

245
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.707
Right. Sorry.
Evidence.

246
00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:04.487
Yes, it's evidence.
It's also been on the ground.

247
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.797
Yeah, you're dangerous.

248
00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:12.251
Hey, Monk...

249
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:16.053
you can still back out.
This is not your case.

250
00:15:16.053 --> 00:15:19.721
- It is now.
- He's just using you.

251
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:21.986
I'm using him, too.

252
00:15:21.986 --> 00:15:24.735
I don't remember you testifying for me
when you had the chance.

253
00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:28.647
That's right, because I knew
that you weren't ready.

254
00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:36.905
Somebody was sitting right here
doing this crossword puzzle. Aah.

255
00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:38.448
Didn't finish.
I hate that.

256
00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:41.715
Well, whoever it was, he must
have left before it went down.

257
00:15:41.715 --> 00:15:43.860
But why wouldn't he take it with him?

258
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.129
To... to finish.

259
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:48.133
Maybe it wasn't his.

260
00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:49.405
No, this is the barbershop copy here.

261
00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:52.041
This had to have been his copy.

262
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:56.190
He must have been working on this
unfinished puzzle for a while.

263
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.613
If I was almost finished
with a difficult crossword,

264
00:15:59.613 --> 00:16:01.634
I'd, I'd take it with me.

265
00:16:01.634 --> 00:16:06.720
Wouldn't you? To finish?

266
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.124
No. Tell me about the witness.

267
00:16:08.124 --> 00:16:13.122
Uh, his name's Philip Bedard,
32, unmarried. Works up the street.

268
00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:15.826
- Is he reliable?
- I hope so.

269
00:16:15.826 --> 00:16:18.449
He works at the U.S. Mint.

270
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:28.042
I can't believe you just said that.

271
00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:31.132
Well, you don't even know me.

272
00:16:31.956 --> 00:16:34.179
Yeah, okay. Okay.

273
00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:36.221
I'll call you later. Bye.

274
00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:41.427
- That was Tony.
- Fat Tony?

275
00:16:41.427 --> 00:16:43.563
He's not fat.

276
00:16:44.561 --> 00:16:47.938
You know, he asked me out
on a date, and, uh...

277
00:16:47.938 --> 00:16:49.257
I told him I'd think about it.

278
00:16:49.257 --> 00:16:52.261
Sharona, you know
what kind of man he is.

279
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:55.231
Yeah, but that's what
I like about him.

280
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:58.879
Look, I, I know you always want to check out
my dates and find out what's wrong with them,

281
00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:00.922
but at least with Tony,

282
00:17:00.922 --> 00:17:02.929
I already know he's a criminal.

283
00:17:02.929 --> 00:17:04.750
I mean, I can't be surprised.

284
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.801
I've been surprised enough, you know?

285
00:17:07.515 --> 00:17:10.465
Well, as long as that
makes sense to you.

286
00:17:11.343 --> 00:17:12.981
Is everything all right?

287
00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:15.399
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Vince.

288
00:17:16.216 --> 00:17:19.963
Vince, you know, you, you
don't have to follow us around.

289
00:17:19.963 --> 00:17:22.129
If we have something to report back to you,

290
00:17:22.129 --> 00:17:23.929
I, I promise we're going to call.

291
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:25.780
Uncle Sal told me
to keep an eye on you.

292
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.657
- It's for your own protection.
- It's a little insulting.

293
00:17:28.657 --> 00:17:31.793
I haven't needed a babysitter
since I was 19.

294
00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:35.097
You had a babysitter
when you were 19?

295
00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:37.664
Everybody did. It was the late '70s.
It was a crazy time.

296
00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:40.406
Mr. Monk, Miss Fleming,
I'm Phil Bedard.

297
00:17:40.406 --> 00:17:43.299
Oh, hello. Thank you so
much for seeing us.

298
00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:45.282
Yes. Thank you.

299
00:17:47.123 --> 00:17:48.919
- This is, uh...
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

300
00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:52.253
Uh, this is, uh, Vince.
He... he's our friend.

301
00:17:52.253 --> 00:17:54.594
- Do they really make money here?
- Yes, they do.

302
00:17:54.594 --> 00:17:57.052
This is the second-largest
mint in the country.

303
00:17:57.052 --> 00:17:58.457
You got any free samples?

304
00:17:58.457 --> 00:18:00.310
That's funny. I've never
heard that one.

305
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.229
Anyway, sorry to keep you waiting.

306
00:18:02.229 --> 00:18:05.634
It takes forever to get through
security these days after last week.

307
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:09.226
- What happened last week?
- We came up 5 cents short.

308
00:18:09.226 --> 00:18:12.985
- All this for 5 cents?
- Well, they weren't just any 5 cents.

309
00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:15.693
They were five coins that
were accidentally misstamped.

310
00:18:15.693 --> 00:18:17.431
Heads on both sides.

311
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.588
Hmm. Were they valuable?

312
00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:20.821
Maybe to a collector.

313
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.359
There's a lot of nuts out there.

314
00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:26.161
You can say you got
a license to print money.

315
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:29.696
Yeah, and that is original as well.

316
00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:36.475
A 4-letter word for infatuation.

317
00:18:36.475 --> 00:18:40.914
- Are you any good at these?
- Nope. Can't do crossword puzzles.

318
00:18:41.613 --> 00:18:44.398
So you witnessed the massacre, right?

319
00:18:44.398 --> 00:18:46.272
Uh, not exactly.
Like I told the police,

320
00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:49.232
I was across the street.
I saw three men go inside,

321
00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:51.359
and then I heard the gunshots.

322
00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:54.931
Don't look now, but
we're being followed.

323
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:57.937
Don't look back,
I said don't, didn't I?

324
00:18:57.937 --> 00:18:59.910
- Where is he?
- Black leather jacket.

325
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.905
He's been following us
since we left the Mint.

326
00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:03.661
- I'll take care of him.
- No, it's okay.

327
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:06.261
He works for the Mint.
Just ignore him.

328
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:10.199
They follow employees at random
as we leave the building.

329
00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:12.097
Now you got two babysitters.

330
00:19:12.097 --> 00:19:16.715
These, these three men that you saw,
what, what did they look like?

331
00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:18.920
I never got a good look at their faces.

332
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.927
- I'm sorry.
- What were they wearing?

333
00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:27.094
Uh, jackets. One, one guy had
number 15 on the back.

334
00:19:27.094 --> 00:19:31.824
- Like a ballplayer?
- No, uh...

335
00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:35.938
- it was, it was written funny.
- Written...

336
00:19:35.938 --> 00:19:41.269
written funny. Like...
like this?

337
00:19:42.652 --> 00:19:47.442
- Did it look like this?
- Maybe. Yeah.

338
00:19:47.442 --> 00:19:50.989
Chinese gang.
The Tongs, that's their symbol.

339
00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:55.074
Yeah, now that you mention it,
they, they could have been Asian.

340
00:19:56.951 --> 00:19:58.496
But everyone else is going.

341
00:19:58.496 --> 00:20:01.293
Benjy, I told you, money
is tight right now.

342
00:20:01.293 --> 00:20:05.287
- We can only afford basic necessities.
- This is a basic necessity to me.

343
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:08.949
It's a theme park. It costs
an arm and a leg just to walk in.

344
00:20:11.468 --> 00:20:13.767
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

345
00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:15.738
Maybe next time.

346
00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.944
- Sharona Fleming?
- Mm-hmm.

347
00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:29.926
- Thank you.
- Sure.

348
00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:43.018
Well...
looks like you're going.

349
00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:45.619
- Your father sent us a check.
- For how much?

350
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.428
For everything, plus four
months in advance.

351
00:20:49.826 --> 00:20:51.776
What's that?

352
00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:04.111
- Hey, Norm.
- It's good as new.

353
00:21:04.111 --> 00:21:06.315
Actually, it's better than new.

354
00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:08.401
I left the keys under the mat, okay?

355
00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:11.381
- You take checks?
- Uh, no charge. No charge at all.

356
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:13.661
It was my pleasure.
My pleasure.

357
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:14.880
Now, I've got to get
back to the garage,

358
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.767
so you have a really nice day, okay?

359
00:21:16.767 --> 00:21:19.033
Okay? See you later. Bye.

360
00:21:19.033 --> 00:21:22.807
Wow, you must have a fairy
godmother or something.

361
00:21:25.602 --> 00:21:27.397
Who's that?

362
00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:31.376
My fairy godmother.

363
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.840
You know, I'm, I'm really glad that your boss
changed his mind about helping my uncle Sal.

364
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.122
How's it going?

365
00:21:39.122 --> 00:21:41.555
Oh, it's going good.
Really good.

366
00:21:41.555 --> 00:21:43.739
We have a couple of leads.

367
00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:45.846
The, the guy at the Mint, uh...

368
00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.523
do you think he's involved?

369
00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:49.446
Well, we checked him out,

370
00:21:49.446 --> 00:21:52.037
and he has no mob connections at all.

371
00:21:52.037 --> 00:21:54.151
No motive.

372
00:21:56.713 --> 00:22:00.553
Did you really lose 55 pounds?

373
00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:03.535
You know, it was easy.
I just...

374
00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:05.171
got used to being hungry.

375
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:09.845
I, I realized that no food tastes
as good as being thin feels.

376
00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:11.770
Except for this.

377
00:22:13.296 --> 00:22:17.343
You know what? I really think you should
talk to your uncle about your nickname.

378
00:22:17.343 --> 00:22:20.492
It, it doesn't fit you anymore.

379
00:22:20.492 --> 00:22:23.250
I thought about it, but...

380
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.567
Uncle Sal is from another century,
you know?

381
00:22:25.567 --> 00:22:27.901
- He's kind of set in his ways.
- Yeah.

382
00:22:27.901 --> 00:22:30.504
I get the feeling Mr. Monk's
the same way.

383
00:22:30.504 --> 00:22:33.241
Well, he's either from another
century or another planet.

384
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:35.229
I can't decide.

385
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.540
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

386
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.843
How did you get my ex
to send me a check?

387
00:22:48.843 --> 00:22:52.059
I just called him up,
had a little chat.

388
00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:56.351
- I can be very persuasive.
- No, I, I was just afraid that, um...

389
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.517
That what?
That I'd hurt him?

390
00:23:00.261 --> 00:23:02.528
Come on, Sharona.
Who do you think I am?

391
00:23:03.163 --> 00:23:06.790
- That's a good question.
- Well, I'm not my uncle. Okay?

392
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.999
I just run some errands for him,
you know, to pay my tuition.

393
00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:12.795
I'm going to night school, Sharona.

394
00:23:12.795 --> 00:23:15.749
By this time next year,
I will have my MBA.

395
00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:20.247
Really? / Yeah, I'm going to
hopefully have my own business.

396
00:23:20.247 --> 00:23:22.005
Oh. Doing what?

397
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.958
- Okay, promise you won't laugh.
- Oh, of course not.

398
00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:31.984
- I really want to open a bookstore.
- Bookstore.

399
00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:35.860
Okay, you sound a little disappointed.

400
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.404
What, you, you'd prefer me
to be a real badass,

401
00:23:38.404 --> 00:23:41.829
you know, a gangster,
like you see on TV, huh?

402
00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:45.186
No. I'm not disappointed.

403
00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:47.191
Not at all.

404
00:23:52.565 --> 00:23:54.335
Uh, yeah, um, excuse me.

405
00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:56.166
We're looking for Jimmy Lu.

406
00:23:58.585 --> 00:24:01.410
Um, you, you speak English?

407
00:24:04.807 --> 00:24:07.391
Send them in.

408
00:24:09.728 --> 00:24:14.143
- Mr. Lu. My name is Adrian.
- I know who you are, Mr. Monk.

409
00:24:14.763 --> 00:24:17.175
I know who you're working for.

410
00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:19.566
I also know you've been
asking people about me.

411
00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:23.604
- Why?
- Um, is this your jacket?

412
00:24:23.604 --> 00:24:27.167
That's right. / Yeah, well, a man was
seen wearing a jacket like this

413
00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:31.611
in Salvatore Lucarelli's barbershop
just before the murders.

414
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:34.766
It wasn't me or my crew.

415
00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:37.045
Someone's lying...
or setting me up.

416
00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:39.775
Excuse me, um, I've been
working on this puzzle.

417
00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:41.544
Maybe you can help me out.

418
00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:44.055
Blank, Jaworski

419
00:24:44.055 --> 00:24:45.869
It's, uh, four letters.

420
00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:49.064
- Any, any ideas?
- 98...

421
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.561
No. Sorry.
99...

422
00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:58.837
Uh, are you, are you stopping?

423
00:24:58.837 --> 00:25:01.734
Are you stopping?
You just, you did 99.

424
00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:04.982
- You can't just stop.
- Why not?

425
00:25:04.982 --> 00:25:08.114
Well, it's not, it's just...
it's not right.

426
00:25:08.114 --> 00:25:13.230
- Why don't you do one more?
- 99 is plenty. 99 is my record.

427
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.730
Uh, Mr. Lu, have you ever been to
Salvatore's barbershop?

428
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.801
Let's just make it an even 100.

429
00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:21.674
Come on, one more, one more.

430
00:25:21.674 --> 00:25:24.914
- Sharona, give him a little boost there.
- I'm not giving him a boost.

431
00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:27.014
- How many can you do, Mr. Monk?
- I don't know.

432
00:25:27.014 --> 00:25:31.729
But I know this. if I ever did 99,
I, I wouldn't stop.

433
00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:35.012
I'd dig down, deep down.

434
00:25:36.385 --> 00:25:39.918
All right.
I'll do one more.

435
00:25:39.918 --> 00:25:42.239
Because you're a friend of Salvatore's.

436
00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:45.424
Tell Salvatore I'm sorry
about what happened.

437
00:25:45.424 --> 00:25:49.658
It's bad business.
Bad for everybody.

438
00:25:49.658 --> 00:25:52.640
No. No.
You just did two.

439
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.733
Why did you do that?
Now he's gotta do 99 more.

440
00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:56.572
Now you have to do 99 more.

441
00:25:56.572 --> 00:25:59.273
I'm just, I'm exhausted.

442
00:26:00.114 --> 00:26:01.584
Look out!

443
00:26:08.142 --> 00:26:11.097
Well, congratulations, Mr. Monk.
You just about started a mob war.

444
00:26:11.097 --> 00:26:13.085
What about them?
Your undercover agents?

445
00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:14.298
They were almost killed in that fire.

446
00:26:14.298 --> 00:26:15.638
Please, no, they weren't.

447
00:26:15.638 --> 00:26:17.431
My shirt was singed.
You saw it.

448
00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:19.083
It was all singed. My sleeve...

449
00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:22.519
why did you tell Salvatore that you thought
the Tongs were behind the barbershop massacre?

450
00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:25.389
- You knew he'd go ballistic.
- We didn't tell Salvatore anything.

451
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:27.894
Whoever, then! Vinnie Spaghetti
obviously heard you talking about it.

452
00:26:27.894 --> 00:26:31.784
I'm not so sure Salvatore had
anything to do with this fire.

453
00:26:31.784 --> 00:26:35.772
A Molotov cocktail doesn't
really seem like his style, does it?

454
00:26:35.772 --> 00:26:38.738
Really? Then who was it then?
Who was it?

455
00:26:38.738 --> 00:26:41.325
Don't know.
Hey, this has been oodles of fun.

456
00:26:41.325 --> 00:26:44.019
Sorry it didn't work out.
We're outta here. Thanks very much.

457
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.282
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

458
00:26:46.282 --> 00:26:50.126
Just, we could use this, all right?

459
00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:54.368
What if you get Salvatore to admit

460
00:26:54.368 --> 00:26:56.532
- on tape that he ordered the attack?
- On tape.

461
00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:57.838
What, you want him to wear a wire?

462
00:26:57.838 --> 00:27:00.517
Are you insane?
If Salvatore finds a wire on him,

463
00:27:00.517 --> 00:27:03.262
- he'll slit his throat.
- Or he'd have Fat Tony do it.

464
00:27:03.262 --> 00:27:05.095
He's not fat.

465
00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:09.734
If you do this, it won't just be me
supporting your reinstatement, all right?

466
00:27:09.734 --> 00:27:11.760
It'll be the attorney general.

467
00:27:14.282 --> 00:27:15.680
Okay, okay.

468
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.357
Here's the thing.

469
00:27:17.357 --> 00:27:20.366
I can't have anything taped to my chest.

470
00:27:21.499 --> 00:27:24.205
Oh, that's fine.
Come here, let me show you this.

471
00:27:25.281 --> 00:27:28.304
Uh, you see, these days...

472
00:27:28.304 --> 00:27:31.018
we can put a transmitter just
about anywhere on the human body.

473
00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:32.795
We have six options.

474
00:27:34.729 --> 00:27:37.722
Number one... is out.

475
00:27:38.297 --> 00:27:41.383
Number two... uh...

476
00:27:42.292 --> 00:27:45.571
you wouldn't actually
shave me there, would you?

477
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:48.805
Okay. No thank you.
Number three...

478
00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:50.591
what if you have to sit down?

479
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:54.187
Right. Good point.
Number four...

480
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:04.856
Even if I die, don't let
them do number four.

481
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.297
- Number five.
- I'll do. okay, I'll, I'll try that.

482
00:28:10.297 --> 00:28:12.387
That's only for women.

483
00:28:12.387 --> 00:28:14.753
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yeah.

484
00:28:15.717 --> 00:28:19.580
Uh, number six.
Number six, I can do that.

485
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.895
- Number six? Great.
- Not four.

486
00:28:27.351 --> 00:28:29.060
Don't touch that, please.

487
00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:35.714
- Randy.
- Sorry.

488
00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:39.030
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Sal.

489
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.619
Thank you for coming.

490
00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:44.404
- He was a sweet kid.
- Yes, he was.

491
00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:45.940
I gave him his first job,

492
00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.362
collecting for me after
school on his bicycle.

493
00:28:49.362 --> 00:28:50.465
I remember.

494
00:28:50.465 --> 00:28:52.724
I was there when he stole that bike.

495
00:28:55.765 --> 00:28:58.088
Testing.
Testing, testing...

496
00:28:58.088 --> 00:29:00.053
Leave it alone.

497
00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:02.394
Mr. Monk, Sharona.

498
00:29:02.394 --> 00:29:03.916
I'm so glad you could come.

499
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:08.085
Well, we're so sorry about your loss.

500
00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:10.182
Uh, how was the service?

501
00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:11.837
It was heartbreaking.

502
00:29:13.697 --> 00:29:16.443
I'm gonna have to frisk you.

503
00:29:16.443 --> 00:29:20.063
- You understand.
- Oh, sure.

504
00:29:20.063 --> 00:29:22.500
- Mm...
- Mr. Monk.

505
00:29:29.982 --> 00:29:33.342
- That is a very nice tie.
- It's mine.

506
00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:37.831
I've had it for... years.

507
00:29:39.581 --> 00:29:42.170
Well, uh, who's next?

508
00:29:50.598 --> 00:29:53.257
You're very thorough.

509
00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:59.311
- Please.
- Adrian, Sharona.

510
00:29:59.311 --> 00:30:02.241
- Thank you for coming.
- Salvatore, how you holding up?

511
00:30:02.911 --> 00:30:06.563
I buried five good men today.

512
00:30:06.563 --> 00:30:09.230
But I'll survive.
I always do.

513
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.291
It's my curse.

514
00:30:12.242 --> 00:30:15.064
You're missing a knife.

515
00:30:15.064 --> 00:30:16.987
It's not missing.
I know where it is.

516
00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:20.704
- Try this scungilli.
- No. Uh, no, no thank you.

517
00:30:20.704 --> 00:30:24.059
- I made it myself.
- Oh, I'd love some. Thank you.

518
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.008
Octopus.

519
00:30:31.152 --> 00:30:33.006
I must have this recipe.

520
00:30:33.006 --> 00:30:35.433
You didn't even taste it.

521
00:30:42.022 --> 00:30:46.818
- Oh, this is delicious.
- I must, I must have this recipe.

522
00:30:49.734 --> 00:30:51.536
So, um,

523
00:30:51.536 --> 00:30:57.153
so, Salvatore, um, I guess
you heard about the, uh,

524
00:30:57.153 --> 00:30:59.679
the firebombing in, in China Town.

525
00:31:01.707 --> 00:31:05.218
- You just nodded. Yes?
- Right.

526
00:31:05.218 --> 00:31:08.307
You have any theories about who
might have... might have done that?

527
00:31:08.307 --> 00:31:12.142
Theories? Theories are
for smart guys like you.

528
00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:14.261
I don't need theories.
I know who did it.

529
00:31:14.261 --> 00:31:15.825
A couple of kids from L.A.

530
00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:18.302
A couple of wannabes
trying to impress me.

531
00:31:18.302 --> 00:31:19.593
I took care of them.

532
00:31:19.593 --> 00:31:21.028
So you didn't do the firebombing.

533
00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:25.043
When I want Jimmy Lu dead,
believe me, he'll know it.

534
00:31:25.043 --> 00:31:26.997
Hey, Luigi.

535
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.618
What?

536
00:31:35.564 --> 00:31:38.217
Uh, what is that?
Get on that now.

537
00:31:45.209 --> 00:31:46.970
Right, right, try this.

538
00:31:49.927 --> 00:31:52.106
- Wait, wait, I think I got it. I got it.
- What, what, what?

539
00:31:57.889 --> 00:32:01.604
- It's still there. It's there.
- Now it's a water stain.

540
00:32:06.097 --> 00:32:07.863
It's gone.

541
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.948
There's something bothering me about
this case. I can't put my finger on it,

542
00:32:15.948 --> 00:32:19.248
but I would love to get back
to that barbershop.

543
00:32:19.248 --> 00:32:22.447
I'll go with you.
I haven't been back since it happened.

544
00:32:22.447 --> 00:32:25.965
Oh, well, you know, it's
an official crime scene.

545
00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:28.502
They don't let civilians in.

546
00:32:28.502 --> 00:32:31.289
Maybe they'll make an exception.
I'll make a call.

547
00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:33.632
Okay, but you'd be wasting your time.

548
00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:38.249
Cause they never let any... anybody in.

549
00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:41.838
What's he doing?

550
00:32:41.838 --> 00:32:43.638
Thinking.

551
00:32:43.638 --> 00:32:45.634
Brainpower, do you see that?

552
00:32:45.634 --> 00:32:47.512
That is the way to solve a problem.

553
00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:49.991
Maybe we ought to try more of that.

554
00:32:49.991 --> 00:32:51.502
Fewer people to bury.

555
00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:54.288
The mystery man is here,
doing the crossword puzzle.

556
00:32:54.288 --> 00:32:58.988
They grab the gumball machine...
run out the back...

557
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.087
they could have grabbed anything.

558
00:33:05.957 --> 00:33:09.991
Why the gumball machine?
Why the gumball machine?

559
00:33:09.991 --> 00:33:13.753
- Sharona. The crime scene photos.
- Here.

560
00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.921
Mr. Lucarelli,
can I say something?

561
00:33:23.353 --> 00:33:26.829
Your nephew Tony here
is in really great shape.

562
00:33:26.829 --> 00:33:29.623
- Oh, come on, Sharona...
- I mean, he's lost a ton of weight,

563
00:33:29.623 --> 00:33:33.478
and he kept it off, which is
really the hard part, so...

564
00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:34.912
Don't you think he should
have a different nickname?

565
00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:37.118
Uncle Sal, I didn't say anything.

566
00:33:37.118 --> 00:33:40.078
He's always been Fat Tony
ever since he was a kid.

567
00:33:40.078 --> 00:33:41.825
Yeah, I know,
but look at him.

568
00:33:41.825 --> 00:33:43.277
What about Big Tony?

569
00:33:43.277 --> 00:33:46.643
- That's pretty close.
- We already got a Big Tony.

570
00:33:46.643 --> 00:33:48.812
- Who?
- Big Tony.

571
00:33:50.126 --> 00:33:52.466
This conversation is over.
In fact, it never happened.

572
00:33:52.466 --> 00:33:54.250
Oh, that's a shame.

573
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.008
- It's not here.
- What, what's not here?

574
00:33:57.008 --> 00:33:58.361
The gumball machine.

575
00:33:58.361 --> 00:34:01.387
Well, they used it to smash the window,
then took off down the alley.

576
00:34:01.387 --> 00:34:03.266
I know, but where is it?

577
00:34:03.266 --> 00:34:06.410
These pictures were taken that morning.

578
00:34:06.974 --> 00:34:09.349
But it's not in the street.

579
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.739
It's not in the back room.

580
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.771
They must have taken it with them.

581
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:17.710
Why would they do that?

582
00:34:25.036 --> 00:34:26.904
Salvatore, sir,

583
00:34:26.904 --> 00:34:31.395
what happened here, these murders,
had nothing to do with you or your family.

584
00:34:33.523 --> 00:34:35.769
It was all...

585
00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:38.007
about these.

586
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:44.344
Gumballs.

587
00:34:45.613 --> 00:34:47.753
Gumballs?

588
00:34:54.287 --> 00:34:55.601
Hey, Phil, how you doing?

589
00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:56.917
Remember us?

590
00:34:57.697 --> 00:35:00.800
You said you didn't like
crossword puzzles.

591
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.525
I thought I'd try one.

592
00:35:03.123 --> 00:35:04.633
Pretty good.

593
00:35:05.147 --> 00:35:08.745
Greek vowel, four letters,
beginning with "I."

594
00:35:08.745 --> 00:35:12.530
- Iota. I-O-T-A.
- Thank you.

595
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.545
I like puzzles, too.

596
00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:16.967
I've been working on
a pretty tough one.

597
00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:18.772
It involves you, Mr. Bedard.

598
00:35:19.598 --> 00:35:21.464
That's you, isn't it?

599
00:35:21.464 --> 00:35:25.217
It was taken in front of the barbershop
the day before the massacre.

600
00:35:25.217 --> 00:35:26.948
Maybe.

601
00:35:26.948 --> 00:35:28.574
That's a pretty big bubble, Phil.

602
00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:32.056
You must've bought, what, four,
maybe five, gumballs?

603
00:35:32.056 --> 00:35:34.039
It was five. Five gumballs.

604
00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:35.780
Here's what happened...

605
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.990
You stole five cents
from your employer last week.

606
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.515
On any other job,
no one would miss it.

607
00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:43.613
Of course, you work for the U.S. Mint.

608
00:35:43.613 --> 00:35:46.757
They were those
five double-headed pennies.

609
00:35:46.757 --> 00:35:51.025
We did a little research.
They're worth $200,000 each.

610
00:35:51.025 --> 00:35:55.144
One of their security guards
must've followed you. You panicked.

611
00:35:55.144 --> 00:35:56.906
You had to get rid of those coins.

612
00:35:56.906 --> 00:36:00.187
You needed to hide them
for a day or two, but where?

613
00:36:00.187 --> 00:36:02.675
The gumball machine.
It was perfect.

614
00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:05.842
You figured you'd come back when
the coast was clear and pick them up.

615
00:36:05.842 --> 00:36:09.973
But you had no idea that the barbershop
was a front for the mob.

616
00:36:09.973 --> 00:36:14.727
You found out, though. The next day,
when you tried to steal the machine.

617
00:36:14.727 --> 00:36:17.683
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

618
00:36:17.683 --> 00:36:21.185
So was it the barber
that tried to stop you?

619
00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:23.708
Or maybe it was a customer.

620
00:36:30.785 --> 00:36:32.161
What the hell are you doing?

621
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:34.213
Whoever it was,
they had a gun...

622
00:36:34.213 --> 00:36:36.583
That you somehow managed to grab,

623
00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:39.396
and then all hell broke loose.

624
00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:13.233
All for five pennies.

625
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:15.791
That's a penny for every
person you killed.

626
00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:18.751
Then you said you witnessed the attack

627
00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:22.829
so that you could steer everyone,
me, the cops, the Lucarelli family...

628
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:26.294
toward that gang in China Town.

629
00:37:26.294 --> 00:37:29.103
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

630
00:37:29.103 --> 00:37:31.984
Those idiots pulled out their guns.
It was an accident.

631
00:37:31.984 --> 00:37:34.651
Things just got out of hand.

632
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:36.136
Anyway, who's going to miss them?

633
00:37:36.136 --> 00:37:37.726
They're gangsters like you said.

634
00:37:37.726 --> 00:37:41.622
Well, accident or not,
you're going to jail.

635
00:37:41.622 --> 00:37:44.245
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

636
00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:47.712
How are you going to prove
any of this without the pennies?

637
00:37:48.372 --> 00:37:51.235
- Did you get that, guys?
- What are you doing?

638
00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:54.365
See that van over there?
Okay, fellas.

639
00:37:54.365 --> 00:37:57.916
You can pick him up now.
Hello.

640
00:37:57.916 --> 00:37:59.509
Here we go.

641
00:38:02.316 --> 00:38:05.083
Watch this.
Let's go!

642
00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:06.761
Here we go.

643
00:38:07.413 --> 00:38:09.755
Now.

644
00:38:10.639 --> 00:38:13.064
- Excuse me. Just keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, yeah.

645
00:38:17.285 --> 00:38:19.490
Why don't you finish your puzzle?

646
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.202
What, what are you doing?
He just confessed. / He did?

647
00:38:23.202 --> 00:38:24.861
- Didn't you hear that?
- No.

648
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:26.919
No, we got nothing but static.

649
00:38:27.902 --> 00:38:30.073
Your necktie, what happened
to the stain?

650
00:38:30.073 --> 00:38:32.124
I finally got it out.

651
00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:37.448
- What did you do to the tie?
- I washed it... ironed it.

652
00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.137
Excuse me. Ironed it?
Are you insane?

653
00:38:40.137 --> 00:38:43.350
That transmitter cost $20,000.

654
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:45.997
- But the stain is out.
- Great, great, we blew it.

655
00:38:45.997 --> 00:38:48.230
Maybe we can trick him
into saying it again.

656
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.045
Oh, really? How are
we gonna do that?

657
00:38:50.045 --> 00:38:53.028
Well, I'll just go back
there, sit down, and say...

658
00:38:53.028 --> 00:38:56.982
What?
It might be worth a try.

659
00:38:56.982 --> 00:38:59.647
Okay, okay, I, I did it!
It was me!

660
00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:01.181
All right? I confess!

661
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:04.004
- Just, just let me in!
- Hey!

662
00:39:05.785 --> 00:39:08.535
I did it, all right?
I stole it. I stole the pennies,

663
00:39:08.535 --> 00:39:11.540
and I shot the place up,
so just arrest me.

664
00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.221
What are you waiting for?

665
00:39:14.864 --> 00:39:16.800
What the...

666
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.222
He's very persuasive.

667
00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:38.238
Sharona.
You still seeing Tony?

668
00:39:39.494 --> 00:39:40.893
Yeah. So?

669
00:39:40.893 --> 00:39:43.789
I've been logging these surveillance
tapes from last week.

670
00:39:44.564 --> 00:39:47.352
This is from Salvatore's car
Tuesday night.

671
00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:50.705
I think you should hear it.

672
00:39:52.446 --> 00:39:53.824
So what's with you and the nurse?

673
00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:56.232
Just having a few laughs,
you know me.

674
00:39:56.232 --> 00:39:58.897
Hey, get this. I told her I'm
gonna open up a bookstore.

675
00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:00.345
You?

676
00:40:01.083 --> 00:40:03.379
I've never even seen you inside a bookstore.

677
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:05.381
What was I gonna tell her, the truth?

678
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:08.171
That I'm your enforcer,
that I hurt people for a living?

679
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:09.895
And she bought it?

680
00:40:09.895 --> 00:40:11.844
Hey, they always buy it.
You know why?

681
00:40:11.844 --> 00:40:14.460
'Cause I tell them what they want to hear.

682
00:40:16.257 --> 00:40:18.566
You okay?

683
00:40:21.465 --> 00:40:23.218
I'm sorry.

684
00:40:28.884 --> 00:40:31.444
Thanks, Randy.

685
00:40:33.132 --> 00:40:36.233
Maybe you won't make such fun
of me all the time now, huh?

686
00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.748
No chance of that.

687
00:40:52.128 --> 00:40:54.142
So, Colmes, where are you going?

688
00:40:54.142 --> 00:40:56.192
Denver. Other fish to fry.

689
00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:58.165
What about Monk?
You had a deal.

690
00:40:58.165 --> 00:40:59.653
The reinstatement hearing.

691
00:40:59.653 --> 00:41:02.091
Yeah, that was if we nailed Lucarelli.

692
00:41:02.091 --> 00:41:03.651
He's out playing golf today.

693
00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:07.639
We just nailed a trigger-happy coin
collector, so the deal is void, captain.

694
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:10.284
- You gave him your word.
- The deal's void, captain.

695
00:41:11.198 --> 00:41:12.951
Let me tell you something, Colmes.

696
00:41:13.902 --> 00:41:20.878
Adrian Monk may be afraid of milk
and germs and elevators and puppies,

697
00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:25.155
but you, you couldn't pack
that man's lunch.

698
00:41:26.543 --> 00:41:28.544
Uh, that's true, actually.

699
00:41:28.544 --> 00:41:29.939
I've seen that man pack a lunch.

700
00:41:29.939 --> 00:41:31.495
He's insane.

701
00:41:31.495 --> 00:41:33.464
It was great working with you, captain.

702
00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:47.066
- He's not gonna help me, is he?
- No. I'm sorry.

703
00:41:47.066 --> 00:41:48.931
I guess I never really expected him to.

704
00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:50.660
Never trust a Fed.

705
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.127
I should've decked him.

706
00:41:53.127 --> 00:41:56.959
No. Don't worry.
I got him back.

707
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.705
Really? What'd you do?

708
00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:01.005
- See their vans?
- Yeah?

709
00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:02.662
One of them is packed full.

710
00:42:02.662 --> 00:42:06.501
The other one isn't even half full.

711
00:42:07.882 --> 00:42:09.628
They're uneven.

712
00:42:09.628 --> 00:42:12.307
I didn't tell him.
I didn't say a word.

713
00:42:12.307 --> 00:42:16.414
I'm just gonna let them
drive away like that.

714
00:42:18.792 --> 00:42:20.305
That'll teach him to mess with us.

715
00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:23.234
- Damn straight.
- Yep.
