1
00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:02.955
Oh, yeah. People try to tell you
it's not a same thing.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.625
But it is. You gotta go.

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.472
Spring training's like a real baseball.

4
00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.226
You know, like it used to be.

5
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:10.332
when we're kids. Grown up.

6
00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.176
Have a seat. You're on deck.

7
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:14.428
And kids love it.

8
00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:16.913
They can sit up close to meet ball players.

9
00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:19.604
I can see the ballpark from the back patio.

10
00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:22.146
Nice.

11
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:32.818
Hey, hey, hey, watch what you're doing,
would you? I'm counting here.

12
00:00:32.853 --> 00:00:35.251
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

13
00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:46.743
What the hell are you doing?

14
00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:14.876
MONK Season 3 Epi. 05
Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather

15
00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:13.745
- How's it look?
- Not so good.

16
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.229
- It's your suspension.
- What? Again? You...

17
00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:20.130
you just fixed my suspension
three months ago.

18
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:22.616
Yeah, that was your struts
and your shocks.

19
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.177
This is the, uh, tie bars.

20
00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.366
What the hell is a tie bar?

21
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.550
It connects your, uh,

22
00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:33.125
steering knuckle to the center link
right there. Can you see that?

23
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.773
Tell him about that noise
your radio keeps making.

24
00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:37.936
That's my music.

25
00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:40.173
So you think I can drive it?

26
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.761
Oh, not like this.
It's a death trap.

27
00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:52.426
What do you think?

28
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:57.839
Well, that death trap thing
sort of concerns me.

29
00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:59.382
I think he's yanking my chain.

30
00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:00.606
I mean, what am I going to do?

31
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.311
I can't fix this myself.

32
00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:04.775
Maybe I can take a look at it.

33
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.805
I'm, I'm pretty handy.

34
00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:12.364
Remember that one time?

35
00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.772
Norm, you win. How much?

36
00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:17.761
$900?

37
00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.958
Where the hell am I
supposed to get $900?

38
00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:22.603
I haven't even seen a check
from my ex in four months.

39
00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:24.534
How are we going to get home?

40
00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.132
Well, I guess we're going
to have to walk.

41
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.014
We could call a taxi.

42
00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.330
Taxis cost money.

43
00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:32.124
- Are you going to pay for it?
- I guess we'll walk.

44
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:37.262
- Ah.
- Whoa.

45
00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:40.760
Uh, excuse me. Adrian monk?

46
00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.315
- Yes.
- I'm Tony lucarelli.

47
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.886
This is Vince, my, uh...

48
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:47.355
Associate.

49
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.658
My associate.

50
00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:51.473
Look, if it's not too inconvenient,

51
00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:54.871
my uncle would like to talk
to you about a possible job.

52
00:03:54.906 --> 00:03:58.073
- A job?
- Uh, Lucarelli...

53
00:03:58.108 --> 00:04:01.796
as in Salvatore lucarelli?

54
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:03.232
You've heard of him.

55
00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:05.786
That'll make his day.

56
00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:08.698
No, thank you. Um...

57
00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.793
Oh, oh.

58
00:04:10.828 --> 00:04:14.039
It's, is that the right time?

59
00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.456
We're already late.

60
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.454
Uh, we've got, we've got that bris.

61
00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.418
Whoa. Whoa.
This is a job.

62
00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:21.637
We can't afford to walk away.

63
00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:23.820
We can't afford not to.

64
00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:27.235
Sharona, Sal lucarelli
is the boss of bosses.

65
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.301
He's the, he's the
west coast godfather.

66
00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:33.149
- So what?
- So what?

67
00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:34.324
You'd take their money?

68
00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:37.861
People who have 110,000 miles
on their car can't be picky.

69
00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:40.746
Fine. Fine.
You go talk to him.

70
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.310
I'll meet you back at the house.

71
00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:48.896
Mr. Monk...

72
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:52.289
you want my advice, I'd
listen to your friend here.

73
00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:55.477
She's as smart as she is pretty.

74
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:58.296
It'll only take 20 minutes.

75
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:01.961
I'm saying please.

76
00:05:01.996 --> 00:05:03.495
All right, pretty please.

77
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.935
With a cherry on top?

78
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.694
With a cherry on top.

79
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.104
- Vince.
- Come on.

80
00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.137
Uh, no, not, not,
not in the back seat.

81
00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:17.528
Wait, wait, wait, Vince, he
has a thing about back seats.

82
00:05:17.563 --> 00:05:19.273
Everybody sits in the back.

83
00:05:19.308 --> 00:05:21.030
Uh, Mr, Mr. Monk.

84
00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:23.943
You can ride in the
front with Vince.

85
00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:27.129
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

86
00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:37.412
Well, I guess that just leaves
you in the back seat with me.

87
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.425
- Are you scared?
- Are you?

88
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:42.443
Mr. Monk, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

89
00:06:42.478 --> 00:06:44.448
It means the world to me.

90
00:06:48.914 --> 00:06:51.110
Oh, he does this all the time.

91
00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:52.565
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

92
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.208
I understand.
I got blood on my hands.

93
00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:58.087
Yes, you do.

94
00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:02.343
I'm supposed to be in pebble beach.

95
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:06.257
Instead I'm here preparing for a wake.

96
00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.597
Did fat Tony tell you about the job?

97
00:07:09.922 --> 00:07:13.392
My sister's boy Ernie got killed yesterday,

98
00:07:13.427 --> 00:07:15.754
plus four of my friends. Good friends.

99
00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.464
Barbershop massacre, right?

100
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.932
Yeah, massacre, That's the word.

101
00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:21.576
I checked around, Mr. Monk.

102
00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:24.736
and other detectives, good detectives
told me you were the best.

103
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.018
Called you a legend.

104
00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:29.769
I'll pay you three times your usual fee
if you tell me who's behind this.

105
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.195
Oh.

106
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.753
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.825
I, I... I can't help you.

108
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.430
Can't? or won't?

109
00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:47.299
My family is hurt, Mr. Monk.
And angry.

110
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.186
I understand how you feel
more than you know.

111
00:07:50.221 --> 00:07:51.620
They're screaming for vengeance.

112
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:55.886
They want me to strike out at one of
the chinese gangs or the russians.

113
00:07:55.921 --> 00:07:57.214
I don't want to make a mistake.

114
00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:59.752
I'm trying to prevent a bloodbath here.

115
00:08:01.202 --> 00:08:06.304
Mm. I'm sorry.

116
00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:10.311
I'm very...
very, very, very sorry.

117
00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.275
I'm very, very, very sorry.

118
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.938
You know, why don't we just sleep on it?
Then maybe Mr. Monk will reconsider.

119
00:08:16.973 --> 00:08:19.386
Yeah, fat Tony's right.

120
00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:21.569
Let's all think about it.

121
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.744
Oh, Mr. Monk...

122
00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:30.315
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

123
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.292
I'm right-handed.

124
00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:38.931
But I, I use my left hand, too.
Almost every day.

125
00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:41.336
Yeah, you used your left
hand this morning.

126
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.060
Right. That's right.

127
00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:45.903
I'm ambidextrous, really.

128
00:08:45.938 --> 00:08:49.824
Yeah, well, why don't you
think about that, too?

129
00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:52.751
This conversation is over.

130
00:08:53.585 --> 00:08:55.458
Oh, he's a charmer.

131
00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.911
- Sharona?
- I'll be right there.

132
00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:03.921
I love you both.

133
00:09:04.784 --> 00:09:07.490
I'd never let anything happen to you.

134
00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:12.636
- I, I love both my hands.
- Good.

135
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:16.188
Even though I don't use
my left hand as much,

136
00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:19.932
- I, I still love it.
- Okay.

137
00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:25.280
- Let's try a different restaurant.
- Thank you.

138
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:28.356
It was great talking to you.
I feel better.

139
00:09:34.737 --> 00:09:35.835
Agent Colmes.

140
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.425
Mr. Monk, how are you?
Get in the van.

141
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.344
- I'm, I'm waiting for Sharona.
- Well, you can wait in the van.

142
00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:43.579
- She won't know where I am.
- Oh, we'll tell her.

143
00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:44.996
Just get in the van, please.
Don't make me say it again.

144
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:47.045
I can't, uh, I, I can't sit in the back.

145
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.044
There's no other seat.

146
00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:50.011
Really, I am not playing
favorites here.

147
00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:54.054
I, I just told the mafia, the, the
same thing. You can ask them.

148
00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:55.807
Yeah, that's really adorable.
In the van now. Get in the van.

149
00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:57.712
I'm getting in, I'm getting in,
I'm getting in.

150
00:09:57.747 --> 00:10:00.189
Look, just for the record,
I'm, I'm using my left hand.

151
00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:03.408
That's fascinating.
Get in the van.

152
00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:08.948
The government can't help but wonder

153
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.074
what you were doing with Salvatore
lucarelli and his underboss fat Tony.

154
00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:15.515
Excuse me.
Why do they call him fat Tony?

155
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.517
Uh, because he used to weigh 250 pounds.

156
00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:22.985
Oh, my god.
Is this the same guy? / Mm.

157
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.719
f
Now, the Lucarelli family's been under

158
00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:27.909
surveillance by a joint ATF/FBI
task force for the last three months.

159
00:10:27.944 --> 00:10:30.209
- Is this the barbershop?
- That is right.

160
00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:32.408
That was taken a week ago,
right before the massacre.

161
00:10:32.443 --> 00:10:33.718
Now, had we stayed
there one more day,

162
00:10:33.753 --> 00:10:35.412
we would have been able to see
the whole thing go down.

163
00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:37.381
Excuse me.
What does he weigh now?

164
00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:38.838
Okay, you know what?
I have no idea.

165
00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:40.970
Mr. Monk, you still haven't
answered my question.

166
00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:42.521
What the hell were
you doing there?

167
00:10:42.556 --> 00:10:46.168
Salvatore wanted to hire me.

168
00:10:46.203 --> 00:10:47.836
Well, that's excellent.
What'd you say?

169
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:50.695
Well, I told him I'd see
him in hell first.

170
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.612
But not in those exact words.

171
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.143
- We'd like you to take that job.
- No.

172
00:10:58.178 --> 00:11:01.257
No, if I take that job and
I I. D. the killers,

173
00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:04.472
Salvatore will go ballistic,
and he'll wipe them all out,

174
00:11:04.507 --> 00:11:06.962
and I, I couldn't live with myself.

175
00:11:06.997 --> 00:11:09.552
Mr. Monk, you're ignoring
the big picture here.

176
00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:11.334
This is an incredible opportunity.

177
00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.281
No one's ever been
inside the family before.

178
00:11:13.316 --> 00:11:16.339
You can get us the evidence that we need
to bring the whole entire family down.

179
00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:19.752
Hey, I showed them my I. D. downstairs.
I just gotto talk to my friend.

180
00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:21.005
What, are you reaching for your gun?

181
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.256
If you're reaching for your gun,
you'd better pull it or step aside.

182
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.551
Monk. Hey.
Colmes.

183
00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:28.927
What do you think you're doing?

184
00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:30.702
Okay, this is a federal operation, captain.

185
00:11:30.737 --> 00:11:32.110
You have no business being here.

186
00:11:32.145 --> 00:11:34.407
Well, neither does he.
What's going on?

187
00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:37.402
They want Adrian to go undercover
and look Lucarelli family.

188
00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:39.163
What's up with this picture
of you and fat Tony?

189
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.490
Nothing, and don't call him that.

190
00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:44.008
You're defending him?

191
00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:45.958
Why don't you start by telling them

192
00:11:45.993 --> 00:11:48.431
what happened to the last agent
that tried to infiltrate that family?

193
00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:50.871
Oh, start by telling them where
they found the body buried.

194
00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:53.530
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Buried?
- Actually, the parts that they found.

195
00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:56.212
Okay, that's a different situation.
That agent's cover was blown.

196
00:11:56.247 --> 00:11:58.841
Monk's been invited in.
They already know he's a cop.

197
00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:01.512
- But I'm not a cop.
- Well, you could be...

198
00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:03.940
if you help us out.

199
00:12:03.975 --> 00:12:05.782
What? What?

200
00:12:05.817 --> 00:12:07.852
Hang on. Whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

201
00:12:07.887 --> 00:12:09.398
What do you mean?

202
00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:11.651
Monk, he's playing you.
Just walk away.

203
00:12:11.686 --> 00:12:13.499
No, wait, no.
I want to hear this.

204
00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.364
What, what, what are you saying?

205
00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:16.974
What I'm saying is...

206
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:21.085
is that if you do me this favor...
this one little tiny favor...

207
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.659
I will call the police commissioner
the next time you're up for reinstatement.

208
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.167
Come here.

209
00:12:28.202 --> 00:12:31.328
Monk, I know this son of a bitch.
He's not to be trusted, okay?

210
00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:34.330
You could go get yourself killed,
he would not so much as bat an eye.

211
00:12:34.365 --> 00:12:36.247
He's right.
It's too dangerous.

212
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.685
But what, what if it was you,

213
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.753
and you didn't have this,
and you wanted it back?

214
00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:50.981
I'll do it.

215
00:12:51.016 --> 00:12:55.122
I'm your...
I'm your man.

216
00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:57.320
Good.

217
00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:05.616
There was a witness eating lunch
across the street around 11:45.

218
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.744
He saw three guys walk in here.

219
00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:11.502
They stood here, rat-a-tat-tat,
like fish in a barrel.

220
00:13:12.902 --> 00:13:14.140
Must have been horrible.

221
00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:18.262
This barbershop was being used
by Salvatore and his crew as a front

222
00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:21.504
for a numbers game they were running
out of this back room.

223
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:25.025
- What's this? - Your friend
fat Tony, it's his life story.

224
00:13:27.343 --> 00:13:30.106
There was 7 grand on that table.

225
00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:35.533
Two indictments?
That doesn't mean anything.

226
00:13:35.568 --> 00:13:37.697
It means he got lucky.

227
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.272
Look, I know why you're
attracted to him.

228
00:13:40.307 --> 00:13:43.500
I get it.
You think he's dangerous.

229
00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.382
Some people think I'm dangerous.

230
00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:49.498
Yeah, people driving behind you.

231
00:13:50.328 --> 00:13:54.411
The ballistic report says,
and special agent Colmes concurs,

232
00:13:54.446 --> 00:13:58.529
that all five victims were killed
with the same weapon, an Ingram MAC-10.

233
00:13:58.564 --> 00:14:00.993
Three killers, but only one gun?

234
00:14:01.028 --> 00:14:03.594
Yeah, maybe they took turns.

235
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:06.718
- The money was still here?
- Yep, 7 grand.

236
00:14:06.753 --> 00:14:08.943
Why wouldn't they just take it?

237
00:14:08.978 --> 00:14:10.990
It wasn't a robbery.

238
00:14:11.025 --> 00:14:13.572
These people don't send e-mails
to each other, Monk.

239
00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:16.159
This is how they send a message.

240
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.364
- What's this?
- From the gumball machine.

241
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.995
The killers must have ripped it out.

242
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.900
Yeah, they used it to break
the window in the back.

243
00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:25.323
That was their only way of escape,

244
00:14:25.358 --> 00:14:27.237
because there were two
uniforms out front.

245
00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:32.495
- Randy.
- Hmm?

246
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.707
Right. Sorry.
Evidence.

247
00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:41.487
Yes, it's evidence.
It's also been on the ground.

248
00:14:41.522 --> 00:14:43.797
Yeah, you're dangerous.

249
00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:49.251
Hey, Monk...

250
00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:53.053
you can still back out.
This is not your case.

251
00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:56.721
- It is now.
- He's just using you.

252
00:14:56.756 --> 00:14:58.986
I'm using him, too.

253
00:14:59.021 --> 00:15:01.735
I don't remember you testifying for me
when you had the chance.

254
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.647
That's right, because I knew
that you weren't ready.

255
00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:13.905
Somebody was sitting right here
doing this crossword puzzle. Aah.

256
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.448
Didn't finish.
I hate that.

257
00:15:15.483 --> 00:15:18.715
Well, whoever it was, he must
have left before it went down.

258
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.860
But why wouldn't he take it with him?

259
00:15:20.895 --> 00:15:23.129
To... to finish.

260
00:15:23.164 --> 00:15:25.133
Maybe it wasn't his.

261
00:15:25.168 --> 00:15:26.405
No, this is the barbershop copy here.

262
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.041
This had to have been his copy.

263
00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:33.190
He must have been working on this
unfinished puzzle for a while.

264
00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:36.613
If I was almost finished
with a difficult crossword,

265
00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:38.634
I'd, I'd take it with me.

266
00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:43.720
Wouldn't you? To finish?

267
00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:45.124
No. Tell me about the witness.

268
00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:50.122
Uh, his name's Philip bedard,
32, unmarried. Works up the street.

269
00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:52.826
- Is he reliable?
- I hope so.

270
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:55.449
He works at the U. S. Mint.

271
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:05.042
I can't believe you just said that.

272
00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:08.132
Well, you don't even know me.

273
00:16:08.956 --> 00:16:11.179
Yeah, okay. Okay.

274
00:16:11.214 --> 00:16:13.221
I'll call you later. Bye.

275
00:16:15.129 --> 00:16:18.427
- That was Tony.
- Fat Tony?

276
00:16:18.462 --> 00:16:20.563
He's not fat.

277
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.938
You know, he asked me out
on a date, and, uh...

278
00:16:24.973 --> 00:16:26.257
I told him I'd think about it.

279
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:29.261
Sharona, you know
what kind of man he is.

280
00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:32.231
Yeah, but that's what
I like about him.

281
00:16:32.266 --> 00:16:34.053
Look, I, I know you
always want to check out

282
00:16:34.054 --> 00:16:35.879
my dates and find out
what's wrong with them,

283
00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:37.922
but at least with Tony,

284
00:16:37.957 --> 00:16:39.929
I already know he's a criminal.

285
00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:41.750
I mean, I can't be surprised.

286
00:16:41.785 --> 00:16:43.801
I've been surprised enough, you know?

287
00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:47.465
Well, as long as that
makes sense to you.

288
00:16:48.343 --> 00:16:49.981
Is everything all right?

289
00:16:50.016 --> 00:16:52.399
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Vince.

290
00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:56.963
Vince, you know, you, you
don't have to follow us around.

291
00:16:56.998 --> 00:16:59.129
If we have something to report back to you,

292
00:16:59.164 --> 00:17:00.929
I, I promise we're going to call.

293
00:17:00.964 --> 00:17:02.780
Uncle Sal told me
to keep an eye on you.

294
00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:05.657
- It's for your own protection.
- It's a little insulting.

295
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.793
I haven't needed a babysitter
since I was 19.

296
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.097
You had a babysitter
when you were 19?

297
00:17:12.132 --> 00:17:14.664
Everybody did. It was the late '70s.
It was a crazy time.

298
00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:17.406
Mr. Monk, Ms. Fleming,
I'm Phil bedard.

299
00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:20.299
Oh, hello. Thank you so
much for seeing us.

300
00:17:20.334 --> 00:17:22.282
Yes. Thank you.

301
00:17:24.123 --> 00:17:25.919
- This is, uh...
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

302
00:17:25.954 --> 00:17:29.253
Uh, this is, uh, Vince.
He... he's our friend.

303
00:17:29.288 --> 00:17:31.594
- Do they really make money here?
- Yes, they do.

304
00:17:31.629 --> 00:17:34.052
This is the second-largest
mint in the country.

305
00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:35.457
You got any free samples?

306
00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:37.310
That's funny. I've never
heard that one.

307
00:17:37.345 --> 00:17:39.229
Anyway, sorry to keep you waiting.

308
00:17:39.264 --> 00:17:42.634
It takes forever to get through
security these days after last week.

309
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:46.226
- What happened last week?
- We came up 5 cents short.

310
00:17:46.261 --> 00:17:49.985
- All this for 5 cents?
- Well, they weren't just any 5 cents.

311
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.693
They were five coins that
were accidentally misstamped.

312
00:17:52.728 --> 00:17:54.431
Heads on both sides.

313
00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:56.588
Hmm. Were they valuable?

314
00:17:56.623 --> 00:17:57.821
Maybe to a collector.

315
00:17:57.856 --> 00:18:00.359
There's a lot of nuts out there.

316
00:18:00.394 --> 00:18:03.161
You can say you got
a license to print money.

317
00:18:03.196 --> 00:18:06.696
Yeah, and that is original as well.

318
00:18:11.329 --> 00:18:13.475
A 4-letter word for infatuation.

319
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.914
- Are you any good at these?
- Nope. Can't do crossword puzzles.

320
00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:21.398
So you witnessed the massacre, right?

321
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.272
Uh, not exactly.
Like I told the police,

322
00:18:23.307 --> 00:18:26.232
I was across the street.
I saw three men go inside,

323
00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:28.359
and then I heard the gunshots.

324
00:18:28.394 --> 00:18:31.931
Don't look now, but
we're being followed.

325
00:18:31.966 --> 00:18:34.937
Don't look back,
I said don't, didn't I?

326
00:18:34.972 --> 00:18:36.910
- Where is he?
- Black leather jacket.

327
00:18:36.945 --> 00:18:38.905
He's been following us
since we left the Mint.

328
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.661
- I'll take care of him.
- No, it's okay.

329
00:18:40.696 --> 00:18:43.261
He works for the Mint.
Just ignore him.

330
00:18:43.296 --> 00:18:47.199
They follow employees at random
as we leave the building.

331
00:18:47.234 --> 00:18:49.097
Now you got two babysitters.

332
00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:53.715
These, these three men that you saw,
what, what did they look like?

333
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.920
I never got a good look at their faces.

334
00:18:55.955 --> 00:18:58.927
- I'm sorry.
- What were they wearing?

335
00:18:58.962 --> 00:19:04.094
Uh, jackets. One, one guy had
number 15 on the back.

336
00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:08.824
- Like a ballplayer?
- No, uh...

337
00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:12.938
- it was, it was written funny.
- Written...

338
00:19:12.973 --> 00:19:18.269
written funny. Like...
like this?

339
00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:24.442
- Did it look like this?
- Maybe. Yeah.

340
00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:27.989
Chinese gang.
The Tongs, that's their symbol.

341
00:19:28.024 --> 00:19:32.074
Yeah, now that you mention it,
they, they could have been asian.

342
00:19:33.951 --> 00:19:35.496
But everyone else is going.

343
00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:38.293
Benjy, I told you, money
is tight right now.

344
00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:42.287
- We can only afford basic necessities.
- This is a basic necessity to me.

345
00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:45.949
It's a theme park. It costs
an arm and a leg just to walk in.

346
00:19:48.468 --> 00:19:50.767
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

347
00:19:50.802 --> 00:19:52.738
Maybe next time.

348
00:19:55.592 --> 00:19:57.944
- Sharona fleming?
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:20:04.743 --> 00:20:06.926
- Thank you.
- Sure.

350
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:20.018
Well...
looks like you're going.

351
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.619
- Your father sent us a check.
- For how much?

352
00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.428
For everything, plus four
months in advance.

353
00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:28.776
What's that?

354
00:20:36.942 --> 00:20:41.111
- Hey, Norm.
- It's good as new.

355
00:20:41.146 --> 00:20:43.315
Actually, it's better than new.

356
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.401
I left the keys under the mat, okay?

357
00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:48.381
- You take checks?
- Uh, no charge. No charge at all.

358
00:20:48.416 --> 00:20:50.661
It was my pleasure.
My pleasure.

359
00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:51.880
Now, I've got to get
back to the garage,

360
00:20:51.915 --> 00:20:53.767
so you have a really nice day, okay?

361
00:20:53.802 --> 00:20:56.033
Okay? See you later. Bye.

362
00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:59.807
Wow, you must have a fairy
godmother or something.

363
00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:04.397
Who's that?

364
00:21:05.528 --> 00:21:08.376
My fairy godmother.

365
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.399
VYou know, I'm, I'm
really glad that your boss

366
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.840
changed his mind about
helping my uncle Sal.

367
00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:16.122
How's it going?

368
00:21:16.157 --> 00:21:18.555
Oh, it's going good.
Really good.

369
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.739
We have a couple of leads.

370
00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:22.846
The, the guy at the Mint, uh...

371
00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:24.523
do you think he's involved?

372
00:21:24.558 --> 00:21:26.446
Well, we checked him out,

373
00:21:26.481 --> 00:21:29.037
and he has no mob connections at all.

374
00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:31.151
No motive.

375
00:21:33.713 --> 00:21:37.553
Did you really lose 55 pounds?

376
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:40.535
You know, it was easy.
I just...

377
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.171
got used to being hungry.

378
00:21:42.206 --> 00:21:46.845
I, I realized that no food tastes
as good as being thin feels.

379
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.770
Except for this.

380
00:21:50.296 --> 00:21:54.343
You know what? I really think you should
talk to your uncle about your nickname.

381
00:21:54.378 --> 00:21:57.492
It, it doesn't fit you anymore.

382
00:21:57.527 --> 00:22:00.250
I thought about it, but...

383
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.567
Uncle Sal is from another century,
you know?

384
00:22:02.602 --> 00:22:04.901
- He's kind of set in his ways.
- Yeah.

385
00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:07.504
I get the feeling Mr. Monk's
the same way.

386
00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:10.241
Well, he's either from another
century or another planet.

387
00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:12.229
I can't decide.

388
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.540
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

389
00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:25.843
How did you get my ex
to send me a check?

390
00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:29.059
I just called him up,
had a little chat.

391
00:22:29.094 --> 00:22:33.351
- I can be very persuasive.
- No, I, I was just afraid that, um...

392
00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:36.517
That what?
That I'd hurt him?

393
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:39.528
Come on, Sharona.
Who do you think I am?

394
00:22:40.163 --> 00:22:43.790
- That's a good question.
- Well, I'm not my uncle. Okay?

395
00:22:43.825 --> 00:22:47.999
I just run some errands for him,
you know, to pay my tuition.

396
00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:49.795
I'm going to night school, Sharona.

397
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.749
By this time next year,
I will have my MBA.

398
00:22:52.784 --> 00:22:57.247
Really? / Yeah, I'm going to
hopefully have my own business.

399
00:22:57.282 --> 00:22:59.005
Oh. Doing what?

400
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.958
- Okay, promise you won't laugh.
- Oh, of course not.

401
00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:08.984
- I really want to open a bookstore.
- Bookstore.

402
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:12.860
Okay, you sound a little disappointed.

403
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:15.404
What, you, you'd prefer me
to be a real badass,

404
00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:18.829
you know, a gangster,
like you see on TV, huh?

405
00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:22.186
No. I'm not disappointed.

406
00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:24.191
Not at all.

407
00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:31.335
Uh, yeah, um, excuse me.

408
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.166
We're looking for Jimmy lu.

409
00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:38.410
Um, you, you speak english?

410
00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:44.391
Send them in.

411
00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:51.143
- Mr. Lu. My name is Adrian.
- I know who you are, Mr. Monk.

412
00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.175
I know who you're working for.

413
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.566
I also know you've been
asking people about me.

414
00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.604
- Why?
- Um, is this your jacket?

415
00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:04.167
That's right. / Yeah, well, a man was
seen wearing a jacket like this

416
00:24:04.202 --> 00:24:08.611
in Salvatore lucarelli's barbershop
just before the murders.

417
00:24:08.646 --> 00:24:11.766
It wasn't me or my crew.

418
00:24:11.801 --> 00:24:14.045
Someone's lying...
or setting me up.

419
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.775
Excuse me, um, I've been
working on this puzzle.

420
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.544
Maybe you can help me out.

421
00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:21.055
Blank, Jaworski

422
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.869
It's, uh, four letters.

423
00:24:22.904 --> 00:24:26.064
- Any, any ideas?
- 98...

424
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.561
No. Sorry.
99...

425
00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:35.837
Uh, are you, are you stopping?

426
00:24:35.872 --> 00:24:38.734
Are you stopping?
You just, you did 99.

427
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:41.982
- You can't just stop.
- Why not?

428
00:24:42.017 --> 00:24:45.114
Well, it's not, it's just.
it's not right.

429
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:50.230
- Why don't you do one more?
- 99 is plenty. 99 is my record.

430
00:24:50.265 --> 00:24:54.730
Uh, Mr. Lu, have you ever been to
Salvatore's barbershop?

431
00:24:54.765 --> 00:24:56.801
Let's just make it an even 100.

432
00:24:56.836 --> 00:24:58.674
Come on, one more. one more.

433
00:24:58.709 --> 00:25:01.914
- Sharona, give him a little boost there.
- I'm not giving him a boost.

434
00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:04.014
- How many can you do, Mr. Monk?
- I don't know.

435
00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:08.729
But I know this. if I ever did 99,
I, I wouldn't stop.

436
00:25:08.764 --> 00:25:12.012
I'd dig down, deep down.

437
00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:16.918
All right.
I'll do one more.

438
00:25:16.953 --> 00:25:19.239
Because you're a friend of Salvatore's.

439
00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:22.424
Tell Salvatore I'm sorry
about what happened.

440
00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:26.658
It's bad business.
Bad for everybody.

441
00:25:26.693 --> 00:25:29.640
No. No.
You just did two.

442
00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:31.733
Why did you do that?
Now he's gotta do 99 more.

443
00:25:31.768 --> 00:25:33.572
Now you have to do 99 more.

444
00:25:33.607 --> 00:25:36.273
I'm just, I'm exhausted.

445
00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:38.584
Look out!

446
00:25:45.142 --> 00:25:48.097
Well, congratulations, Mr. Monk.
You just about started a mob war.

447
00:25:48.132 --> 00:25:50.085
What about them?
your undercover agents?

448
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.298
They were almost killed in that fire.

449
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:52.638
Please, no, they weren't.

450
00:25:52.673 --> 00:25:54.431
My shirt was singed.
You saw it.

451
00:25:54.466 --> 00:25:56.083
It was all singed. My sleeve...

452
00:25:56.118 --> 00:25:57.762
why did you tell
Salvatore that you thought

453
00:25:57.763 --> 00:25:59.519
the Tongs were behind
the barbershop massacre?

454
00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:02.389
- You knew he'd go ballistic.
- We didn't tell Salvatore anything.

455
00:26:02.424 --> 00:26:04.894
Whoever, then! Vinnie spaghetti
obviously heard you talking about it.

456
00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:08.784
I'm not so sure Salvatore had
anything to do with this fire.

457
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:12.772
A molotov cocktail doesn't
really seem like his style, does it?

458
00:26:12.807 --> 00:26:15.738
Really? Then who was it then?
Who was it?

459
00:26:15.773 --> 00:26:18.325
Don't know.
Hey, this has been oodles of fun.

460
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.019
Sorry it didn't work out.
We're outta here. Thanks very much.

461
00:26:21.054 --> 00:26:23.282
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

462
00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:27.126
Just, we could use this, all right?

463
00:26:27.161 --> 00:26:31.368
What if you get Salvatore to admit

464
00:26:31.403 --> 00:26:33.532
- on tape that he ordered the attack?
- On tape.

465
00:26:33.567 --> 00:26:34.838
What, you want him to wear a wire?

466
00:26:34.873 --> 00:26:37.517
Are you insane?
If Salvatore finds a wire on him,

467
00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:40.262
- he'll slit his throat.
- Or he'd have fat Tony do it.

468
00:26:40.297 --> 00:26:42.095
He's not fat.

469
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.734
If you do this, it won't just be me
supporting your reinstatement, all right?

470
00:26:46.769 --> 00:26:48.760
It'll be the attorney general.

471
00:26:51.282 --> 00:26:52.680
Okay, okay.

472
00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:54.357
Here's the thing.

473
00:26:54.392 --> 00:26:57.366
I can't have anything taped to my chest.

474
00:26:58.499 --> 00:27:01.205
Oh, that's fine.
Come here, let me show you this.

475
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:05.304
Uh, you see, these days...

476
00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:08.018
we can put a transmitter just
about anywhere on the human body.

477
00:27:08.053 --> 00:27:09.795
We have six options.

478
00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:14.722
Number one... is out.

479
00:27:15.297 --> 00:27:18.383
Number two... uh...

480
00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:22.571
you wouldn't actually
shave me there, would you?

481
00:27:22.606 --> 00:27:25.805
Okay. No thank you.
Number three...

482
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.591
what if you have to sit down?

483
00:27:27.626 --> 00:27:31.187
Right. Good point.
Number four...

484
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:41.856
Even if I die, don't let
them do number four.

485
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.297
- Number five.
- I'll do. okay, I'll, I'll try that.

486
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.387
That's only for women.

487
00:27:49.422 --> 00:27:51.753
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:27:52.717 --> 00:27:56.580
Uh, number six.
Number six, I can do that.

489
00:27:56.615 --> 00:28:00.895
- Number six? Great.
- Not four.

490
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.060
Don't touch that, please.

491
00:28:10.964 --> 00:28:12.714
- Randy.
- Sorry.

492
00:28:13.215 --> 00:28:16.030
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Sal.

493
00:28:16.065 --> 00:28:18.619
Thank you for coming.

494
00:28:18.654 --> 00:28:21.404
- He was a sweet kid.
- Yes, he was.

495
00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:22.940
I gave him his first job,

496
00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:26.362
collecting for me after
school on his bicycle.

497
00:28:26.397 --> 00:28:27.465
I remember.

498
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.724
I was there when he stole that bike.

499
00:28:32.765 --> 00:28:35.088
Testing.
Testing, testing...

500
00:28:35.123 --> 00:28:37.053
Leave it alone.

501
00:28:37.088 --> 00:28:39.394
Mr. Monk, Sharona.

502
00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:40.916
I'm so glad you could come.

503
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:45.085
Well, we're so sorry about your loss.

504
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.182
Uh, how was the service?

505
00:28:47.217 --> 00:28:48.837
It was heartbreaking.

506
00:28:50.697 --> 00:28:53.443
I'm gonna have to frisk you.

507
00:28:53.478 --> 00:28:57.063
- You understand.
- Oh, sure.

508
00:28:57.098 --> 00:28:59.500
- Mm...
- Mr. Monk.

509
00:29:06.982 --> 00:29:10.342
- That is a very nice tie.
- It's mine.

510
00:29:10.377 --> 00:29:14.831
I've had it for... years.

511
00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:19.170
Well, uh, who's next?

512
00:29:27.598 --> 00:29:30.257
You're very thorough.

513
00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:36.311
- Please.
- Adrian, Sharona.

514
00:29:36.346 --> 00:29:39.241
- Thank you for coming.
- Salvatore, how you holding up?

515
00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:43.563
I buried five good men today.

516
00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:46.230
But I'll survive.
I always do.

517
00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:48.291
It's my curse.

518
00:29:49.242 --> 00:29:52.064
You're missing a knife.

519
00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:53.987
It's not missing.
I know where it is.

520
00:29:54.469 --> 00:29:57.704
- Try this scungilli.
- No. Uh, no, no thank you.

521
00:29:57.739 --> 00:30:01.059
- I made it myself.
- Oh, I'd love some. Thank you.

522
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.008
Octopus.

523
00:30:08.152 --> 00:30:10.006
I must have this recipe.

524
00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:12.433
You didn't even taste it.

525
00:30:19.022 --> 00:30:23.818
- Oh, this is delicious.
- I must, I must have this recipe.

526
00:30:26.734 --> 00:30:28.536
So, um,

527
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:34.153
so, Salvatore, um, I guess
you heard about the, uh,

528
00:30:34.188 --> 00:30:36.679
the firebombing in, in china town.

529
00:30:38.707 --> 00:30:42.218
- You just nodded. Yes?
- Right.

530
00:30:42.253 --> 00:30:45.307
You have any theories about who
might have...might have done that?

531
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:49.142
Theories? Theories are
for smart guys like you.

532
00:30:49.177 --> 00:30:51.261
I don't need theories.
I know who did it.

533
00:30:51.296 --> 00:30:52.825
A couple of kids from L. A.

534
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.302
A couple of wannabes
trying to impress me.

535
00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:56.593
I took care of them.

536
00:30:56.628 --> 00:30:58.028
So you didn't do the firebombing.

537
00:30:58.063 --> 00:31:02.043
When I want Jimmy lu dead,
believe me, he'll know it.

538
00:31:02.078 --> 00:31:03.997
Hey, Luigi.

539
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.618
What?

540
00:31:12.564 --> 00:31:15.217
Uh, what is that?
Get on that now.

541
00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:23.970
Right, right, try this.

542
00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:29.106
- Wait, wait, I think I got it. I got it.
- What, what, what?

543
00:31:34.889 --> 00:31:38.604
- It's still there. It's there.
- Now it's a water stain.

544
00:31:43.097 --> 00:31:44.863
It's gone.

545
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.948
There's something bothering me about
this case. I can't put my finger on it,

546
00:31:52.983 --> 00:31:56.248
but I would love to get back
to that barbershop.

547
00:31:56.283 --> 00:31:59.447
I'll go with you.
I haven't been back since it happened.

548
00:31:59.482 --> 00:32:02.965
Oh, well, you know, it's
an official crime scene.

549
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.502
They don't let civilians in.

550
00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:08.289
Maybe they'll make an exception.
I'll make a call.

551
00:32:08.324 --> 00:32:10.632
Okay, but you'd be wasting your time.

552
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:15.249
Cause they never let any... anybody in.

553
00:32:16.952 --> 00:32:18.838
What's he doing?

554
00:32:18.873 --> 00:32:20.638
Thinking.

555
00:32:20.673 --> 00:32:22.634
Brainpower, do you see that?

556
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:24.512
That is the way to solve a problem.

557
00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:26.991
Maybe we ought to try more of that.

558
00:32:27.026 --> 00:32:28.502
Fewer people to bury.

559
00:32:28.537 --> 00:32:31.288
The mystery man is here,
doing the crossword puzzle.

560
00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:35.988
They grab the gumball machine...
run out the back...

561
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.087
they could have grabbed anything.

562
00:32:42.957 --> 00:32:46.991
Why the gumball machine?
Why the gumball machine?

563
00:32:47.026 --> 00:32:50.753
- Sharona. The crime scene photos.
- Here.

564
00:32:56.731 --> 00:32:58.921
Mr. Lucarelli,
can I say something?

565
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:03.829
Your nephew Tony here
is in really great shape.

566
00:33:03.864 --> 00:33:06.623
- Oh, come on, Sharona...
- I mean, he's lost a ton of weight,

567
00:33:06.658 --> 00:33:10.478
and he kept it off, which is
really the hard part, so...

568
00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:11.912
Don't you think he should
have a different nickname?

569
00:33:11.947 --> 00:33:14.118
Uncle Sal, I didn't say anything.

570
00:33:14.153 --> 00:33:17.078
He's always been fat Tony
ever since he was a kid.

571
00:33:17.113 --> 00:33:18.825
Yeah, I know,
but look at him.

572
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.277
What about big Tony?

573
00:33:20.312 --> 00:33:23.643
- That's pretty close.
- We already got a big Tony.

574
00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:25.812
- Who?
- Big Tony.

575
00:33:27.126 --> 00:33:29.466
This conversation is over.
In fact, it never happened.

576
00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:31.250
Oh, that's a shame.

577
00:33:31.285 --> 00:33:34.008
- It's not here.
- What, what's not here?

578
00:33:34.043 --> 00:33:35.361
The gumball machine.

579
00:33:35.396 --> 00:33:38.387
Well, they used it to smash the window,
then took off down the alley.

580
00:33:38.422 --> 00:33:40.266
I know, but where is it?

581
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:43.410
These pictures were taken that morning.

582
00:33:43.974 --> 00:33:46.349
But it's not in the street.

583
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.739
It's not in the back room.

584
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.771
They must have taken it with them.

585
00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:54.710
Why would they do that?

586
00:34:02.036 --> 00:34:03.904
Salvatore, sir,

587
00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:08.395
what happened here, these murders,
had nothing to do with you or your family.

588
00:34:10.523 --> 00:34:12.769
It was all...

589
00:34:12.804 --> 00:34:15.007
about these.

590
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.344
Gumballs.

591
00:34:22.613 --> 00:34:24.753
Gumballs?

592
00:34:31.287 --> 00:34:32.601
Hey, Phil, how you doing?

593
00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:33.917
Remember us?

594
00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:37.800
You said you didn't like
crossword puzzles.

595
00:34:37.835 --> 00:34:39.525
I thought I'd try one.

596
00:34:40.123 --> 00:34:41.633
Pretty good.

597
00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:45.745
Greek vowel, four letters,
beginning with "I."

598
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.530
- lota. I, O, T, A.
- Thank you.

599
00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:51.545
I like puzzles, too.

600
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.967
I've been working on
a pretty tough one.

601
00:34:54.002 --> 00:34:55.772
It involves you, Mr. Bedard.

602
00:34:56.598 --> 00:34:58.464
That's you, isn't it?

603
00:34:58.499 --> 00:35:02.217
It was taken in front of the barbershop
the day before the massacre.

604
00:35:02.252 --> 00:35:03.948
Maybe.

605
00:35:03.983 --> 00:35:05.574
That's a pretty big bubble, Phil.

606
00:35:05.609 --> 00:35:09.056
You must've bought, what, four,
maybe five, gumballs?

607
00:35:09.091 --> 00:35:11.039
It was five. Five gumballs.

608
00:35:11.074 --> 00:35:12.780
Here's what happened...

609
00:35:12.815 --> 00:35:15.990
You stole five cents
from your employer last week.

610
00:35:16.025 --> 00:35:18.515
On any other job,
no one would miss it.

611
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.613
Of course, you work for the U. S. Mint.

612
00:35:20.648 --> 00:35:23.757
They were those
five double-headed pennies.

613
00:35:23.792 --> 00:35:28.025
We did a little research.
They're worth $200,000 each.

614
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.144
One of their security guards
must've followed you. You panicked.

615
00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:33.906
You had to get rid of those coins.

616
00:35:33.941 --> 00:35:37.187
You needed to hide them
for a day or two, but where?

617
00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:39.675
The gumball machine.
It was perfect.

618
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.842
You figured you'd come back when
the coast was clear and pick them up.

619
00:35:42.877 --> 00:35:46.973
But you had no idea that the barbershop
was a front for the mob.

620
00:35:47.008 --> 00:35:51.727
You found out, though. The next day,
when you tried to steal the machine.

621
00:35:51.762 --> 00:35:54.683
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

622
00:35:54.718 --> 00:35:58.185
So was it the barber
that tried to stop you?

623
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.708
Or maybe it was a customer.

624
00:36:07.785 --> 00:36:09.161
What the hell are you doing?

625
00:36:09.196 --> 00:36:11.213
Whoever it was,
they had a gun...

626
00:36:11.248 --> 00:36:13.583
That you somehow managed to grab,

627
00:36:13.618 --> 00:36:16.396
and then all hell broke loose.

628
00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.233
All for five pennies.

629
00:36:50.268 --> 00:36:52.791
That's a penny for every
person you killed.

630
00:36:52.826 --> 00:36:55.751
Then you said you witnessed the attack

631
00:36:55.786 --> 00:36:59.829
so that you could steer everyone,
me, the cops, the Lucarelli family...

632
00:36:59.864 --> 00:37:03.294
toward that gang in china town.

633
00:37:03.329 --> 00:37:06.103
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

634
00:37:06.138 --> 00:37:08.984
Those idiots pulled out their guns.
It was an accident.

635
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:11.651
Things just got out of hand.

636
00:37:11.686 --> 00:37:13.136
Anyway, who's going to miss them?

637
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:14.726
They're gangsters like you said.

638
00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:18.622
Well, accident or not,
you're going to jail.

639
00:37:18.657 --> 00:37:21.245
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

640
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.712
How are you going to prove
any of this without the pennies?

641
00:37:25.372 --> 00:37:28.235
- Did you get that, guys?
- What are you doing?

642
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.365
See that van over there?
Okay, fellas.

643
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.916
You can pick him up now.
Hello.

644
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:36.509
Here we go.

645
00:37:39.316 --> 00:37:42.083
Watch this.
Let's go!

646
00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:43.761
Here we go.

647
00:37:44.413 --> 00:37:46.755
Now.

648
00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:50.064
- Excuse me. Just keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, yeah.

649
00:37:54.285 --> 00:37:56.490
Why don't you finish your puzzle?

650
00:37:56.525 --> 00:38:00.202
What, what are you doing?
He just confessed. / He did?

651
00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:01.861
- Didn't you hear that?
- No.

652
00:38:01.896 --> 00:38:03.919
No, we got nothing but static.

653
00:38:04.902 --> 00:38:07.073
Your necktie, what happened
to the stain?

654
00:38:07.108 --> 00:38:09.124
I finally got it out.

655
00:38:09.901 --> 00:38:14.448
- What did you do to the tie?
- I washed it... ironed it.

656
00:38:14.483 --> 00:38:17.137
Excuse me. Ironed it?
Are you insane?

657
00:38:17.172 --> 00:38:20.350
That transmitter cost $20,000.

658
00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:22.997
- But the stain is out.
- Great, great, we blew it.

659
00:38:23.032 --> 00:38:25.230
Maybe we can trick him
into saying it again.

660
00:38:25.265 --> 00:38:27.045
Oh, really? How are
we gonna do that?

661
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.028
Well, I'll just go back
there, sit down, and say...

662
00:38:30.063 --> 00:38:33.982
What?
It might be worth a try.

663
00:38:34.017 --> 00:38:36.647
Okay, okay, I, I did it!
It was me!

664
00:38:36.682 --> 00:38:38.181
All right? I confess!

665
00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:41.004
- Just, just let me in!
- Hey!

666
00:38:42.785 --> 00:38:45.535
I did it, all right?
I stole it. I stole the pennies,

667
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.540
and I shot the place up,
so just arrest me.

668
00:38:48.575 --> 00:38:50.221
What are you waiting for?

669
00:38:51.864 --> 00:38:53.800
What the...

670
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.222
He's very persuasive.

671
00:39:12.806 --> 00:39:15.238
Sharona.
You still seeing Tony?

672
00:39:16.494 --> 00:39:17.893
Yeah. So?

673
00:39:17.928 --> 00:39:20.789
I've been logging these surveillance
tapes from last week.

674
00:39:21.564 --> 00:39:24.352
This is from Salvatore's car
Tuesday night.

675
00:39:25.876 --> 00:39:27.705
I think you should hear it.

676
00:39:29.446 --> 00:39:30.824
So what's with you and the nurse?

677
00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:33.232
Just having a few laughs,
you know me.

678
00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:35.897
Hey, get this. I told her I'm
gonna open up a bookstore.

679
00:39:35.932 --> 00:39:37.345
You?

680
00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:40.379
I've never even seen
you inside a bookstore.

681
00:39:40.414 --> 00:39:42.381
What was I gonna tell her, the truth?

682
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:45.171
That I'm your enforcer,
that I hurt people for a living?

683
00:39:45.206 --> 00:39:46.895
And she bought it?

684
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.844
Hey, they always buy it.
You know why?

685
00:39:48.879 --> 00:39:51.460
'Cause I tell them what they want to hear.

686
00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.566
You okay?

687
00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:00.218
I'm sorry.

688
00:40:05.884 --> 00:40:08.444
Thanks, Randy.

689
00:40:10.132 --> 00:40:13.233
Maybe you won't make such fun
of me all the time now, huh?

690
00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:15.748
No chance of that.

691
00:40:29.128 --> 00:40:31.142
So, Colmes, where are you going?

692
00:40:31.177 --> 00:40:33.192
Denver. Other fish to fry.

693
00:40:33.227 --> 00:40:35.165
What about Monk?
You had a deal.

694
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.653
The reinstatement hearing.

695
00:40:36.688 --> 00:40:39.091
Yeah, that was if we nailed Lucarelli.

696
00:40:39.126 --> 00:40:40.651
He's out playing golf today.

697
00:40:40.686 --> 00:40:44.639
We just nailed a trigger-happy coin
collector, so the deal is void, captain.

698
00:40:44.674 --> 00:40:47.284
- You gave him your word.
- The deal's void, captain.

699
00:40:48.198 --> 00:40:49.951
Let me tell you something, Colmes.

700
00:40:50.902 --> 00:40:57.878
Adrian monk may be afraid of milk
and germs and elevators and puppies,

701
00:40:57.913 --> 00:41:02.155
but you, you couldn't pack
that man's lunch.

702
00:41:03.543 --> 00:41:05.544
Uh, that's true, actually.

703
00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:06.939
I've seen that man pack a lunch.

704
00:41:06.974 --> 00:41:08.495
He's insane.

705
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.464
It was great working with you, captain.

706
00:41:19.937 --> 00:41:24.066
- He's not gonna help me, is he?
- No. I'm sorry.

707
00:41:24.101 --> 00:41:25.931
I guess I never really expected him to.

708
00:41:25.966 --> 00:41:27.660
Never trust a Fed.

709
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:30.127
I should've decked him.

710
00:41:30.162 --> 00:41:33.959
No. Don't worry.
I got him back.

711
00:41:33.994 --> 00:41:35.705
Really? What'd you do?

712
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.005
- See their vans?
- Yeah?

713
00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.662
One of them is packed full.

714
00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:43.501
The other one isn't even half full.

715
00:41:44.882 --> 00:41:46.628
They're uneven.

716
00:41:46.663 --> 00:41:49.307
I didn't tell him.
I didn't say a word.

717
00:41:49.342 --> 00:41:53.414
I'm just gonna let them
drive away like that.

718
00:41:55.792 --> 00:41:57.305
That'll teach him to mess with us.

719
00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.234
- Damn straight.
- Yep.

720
