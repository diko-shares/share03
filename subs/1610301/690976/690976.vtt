in the middle of the meet.

00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:30.628
Well, I told you how you
first came to me, right?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.692
Yeah. After my parents died
when I was a baby.

111

Well, it's actually
more complicated than that.

112
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.567
You see, your dad, he was
always one for telling stories.

113
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:46.104
So when he told me he had fallen
in love and married a mermaid,

114
00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:49.450
well, I thought it was
just another whopper.

have told you before,

So that's what he told me. And
now I know I'm losing my mind,

See, this website
says in mythology,

160
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.178
mermaids come of age
around 16,

161
00:11:37.253 --> 00:11:39.221

through physical changes,

like longer or
different-colored hair.

Ha! That proves it!

164
00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:47.823
Yes! It proves you can make up
anything and put it on the Internet.

It's not made up, it's real
mermaid fact! Liah's proof!

00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:54.826
I'm not proof!
I'm not a mermaid!

out of this craziness, not deeper in.

was breathing underwater!

175
00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:20.355
Yes! You didn't even
tell us she was sparkly.

176
00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:24.627
(GIGGLES) Thank you. I do
have a name, though. Zuma.

177
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.895
Sorry for not
introducing myself sooner.

178
00:12:26.969 --> 00:12:30.769
Oh! Don't even worry about it.
It's great to meet you.

179
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.205
And you, too.

180
00:12:32.275 --> 00:12:35.301
This cannot
be happening.

181
00:12:35.378 --> 00:12:41.214
This is real! Zuma is Liah's
mermaid spirit guide. Right?

182
00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:45.376
(CHUCKLING) I'm just a friend. I
was close with Merliah's mother.

183
00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:48.284
You knew my mother?

184
00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:52.350
Everyone knew your mother.
She was the Queen of Oceana

185
00:12:52.795 --> 00:12:55.320
until her sister
Eris overthrew her.

186
00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:57.832
Ever since then,
Eris has ruled selfishly,

187
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.130
putting Oceana
in great danger.

188
00:13:01.304 --> 00:13:05.638
So you're saying Liah
isn't just a mermaid,

189
00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:07.403
she's mermaid royalty.

190
00:13:08.644 --> 00:13:11.112
Tell me you're not
starting to believe this.

191
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.740
We're talking to
a pink sparkly dolphin.

192
00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:17.582
A mer-princess.
Oh, that's so beautiful.

193
00:13:17.653 --> 00:13:20.315
Stop! Okay.

194
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:23.654
If this all happened years
ago, why are you telling me now?

195
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.395
Because you've come of age.
Your mermaid self has resurfaced.

196
00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:32.525
Now you can return
to Oceana and defeat Eris,

197
00:13:32.601 --> 00:13:34.865
just as
the Destinies foretold!

198
00:13:34.937 --> 00:13:36.529
That is so deep.

199
00:13:36.672 --> 00:13:40.904
Deeply crazy. My destiny is to
be the best surfer in Malibu.

200
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.611

getting in the way of my destiny!

201
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.410
And as for Oceana,
even if it does exist...

202
00:13:47.483 --> 00:13:48.814
Which it does.

203
00:13:48.884 --> 00:13:51.717
Why should I care
if it's in trouble? I don't!

204
00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:53.618
I don't care
about any of this,

205
00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:55.884
including some
make-believe mermaid mother

206
00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:00.151
and her make-believe
protective necklace!

(GASPS) Calissa is alive!
This image proves it!

210
00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:23.275
I don't understand.
Is this my mother right now?

211
00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:25.952
Yes. Your necklace
can create that image,

212
00:14:26.088 --> 00:14:28.488
because your mother
filled it with Merillia,

213
00:14:28.557 --> 00:14:30.582
the life force of the sea.

214
00:14:31.293 --> 00:14:32.692
Is she okay?

215
00:14:32.895 --> 00:14:36.922
No one in Oceana is okay.
Not while Eris rules.

216
00:14:37.266 --> 00:14:40.099
And you're the only one
who can stop her.

217
00:14:47.777 --> 00:14:50.769
I'll go down to Oceana.
I'll help defeat Eris.

218
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.948
And fulfill your
mermaid destiny!

219
00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:54.243
No.

220
00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:56.375
If my mother can make
a magic necklace,

221
00:14:56.452 --> 00:15:00.684
she can help me get rid of these crazy
changes and get me back to normal.

222
00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:05.421
Then I'm back here for good and we
forget any of this ever happened.

224

227
00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:34.011

I've gone and that I'm okay.

228

229
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:41.489
Is that what came out
of my necklace charm?

230
00:16:41.557 --> 00:16:42.683
Merillia?

231
00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:44.953
Yes, the life force
of the sea.

232
00:16:45.794 --> 00:16:47.819
Only the royal
family can spin it,

233
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.988
and it's their
greatest pleasure.

234

You might do it
yourself one day...

235
00:16:53.469 --> 00:16:57.132
Oh, Calissa's Merillia made
the coral vibrant and healthy,

236
00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:00.371
but Eris' Merillia,
it just isn't as strong,

237
00:17:00.442 --> 00:17:04.572
so the unhealthy coral turns
colors, much like your autumn leaves.

238
00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:09.251
They're beautiful,
but they're dying.

239

As is the ocean itself.

240

Her mother is Calissa.

that Calissa is alive.

Then Merliah can fulfill the
prediction. She can overthrow Eris!

rule Oceana again!

529

536
00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:27.482
Hmm. Nothing comes up.

537
00:34:27.555 --> 00:34:29.682
See? It doesn't exist.

538
00:34:29.757 --> 00:34:31.418
We don't know that.

539
00:34:31.492 --> 00:34:32.982
What did you say
about it, Zuma?

540
00:34:33.061 --> 00:34:36.258
It's "where mer-folk may see,
but never touch"?

541
00:34:38.499 --> 00:34:39.625
Where could that be?

542
00:34:39.701 --> 00:34:41.794
Oh, we can't touch
things on land.

543
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:43.769
Can't see them
there, either.

544
00:34:44.138 --> 00:34:47.369
So it would have
to be underwater,

545
00:34:47.442 --> 00:34:49.910
but in a place
you couldn't reach.

546
00:34:50.878 --> 00:34:54.041

underwater caves off the coast?</i>

547

big air pockets inside?</i>

548
00:34:58.052 --> 00:35:00.247
Yes, the Yafos Caves.

549
00:35:00.588 --> 00:35:03.921
<i>Maybe 40 miles off the
coast of Malibu, southwest.</i>

550
00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:06.156

Come on. Let's go!

559
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:33.277
You're sure, Remo? No one near
Seaphora saw anyone strange?

560
00:35:33.454 --> 00:35:35.354
No one, Your Highness.

561
00:35:35.423 --> 00:35:39.621
Fine. Then we'll just have to
get our answers somewhere else.

Eris.

563
00:35:51.306 --> 00:35:53.331
Hello, sister.

564
00:35:53.408 --> 00:35:55.842
I spoke with
the Destinies today.

565
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.504
Lovely girls.
They gave me good news.

566
00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:01.605
Guess what?
I'm an aunt.

567
00:36:03.084 --> 00:36:07.384
How strange. What long-lost
sibling is the lucky parent?

568
00:36:07.822 --> 00:36:11.986
Ooh, nice try, sis,
but the baby is yours.

569
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.721
Only she's not
a baby now, is she?

570
00:36:14.796 --> 00:36:19.392
You found a way to hide
her from me a long time ago,

571
00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:22.834
but now she's all grown up,
and here in Oceana.

572
00:36:24.872 --> 00:36:26.840
Tell me how
to find her.

573
00:36:27.342 --> 00:36:28.707
How would I know?

574
00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:30.676
Even if I did
have a daughter,

575
00:36:30.745 --> 00:36:33.077
I've been locked up
for 15 years.

576
00:36:33.648 --> 00:36:35.445
I wouldn't know
anything about her.

577
00:36:35.516 --> 00:36:38.508
Oh, I'm sure
you know something.

578
00:36:38.586 --> 00:36:41.749
Like the name of the lucky
mer-man who's her father.

579
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.621
Unless...
No, that's madness.

580
00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:49.162
You wouldn't have,
would you?

581
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.529
Is the father not
a mer-man at all?

582
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.331
Is it that human
you used to swoon over?

583
00:36:57.972 --> 00:37:00.634
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

584
00:37:00.708 --> 00:37:03.768
(LAUGHING)
A half-human?

585
00:37:03.845 --> 00:37:06.177
Better to give me
a clue how to find her,

586
00:37:06.247 --> 00:37:09.011
then maybe
I'll show her some mercy.

587
00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:15.287
That's your decision.
But I'll find her.

588
00:37:15.356 --> 00:37:19.383
And until I do, every hour you
don't tell me what I want to know,

589
00:37:20.795 --> 00:37:23.889
I will imprison
10 innocent mer-folk.

590
00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:28.763
Nothing to say?
Fine. Your choice.

591
00:37:29.737 --> 00:37:32.638
Oh, and the Merillia you're
spinning is still terrible.

592
00:37:32.707 --> 00:37:34.675
You're poisoning Oceana.

593
00:37:34.876 --> 00:37:39.040
No, Eris, you are! My
Merillia reflects my emotions.

594
00:37:39.113 --> 00:37:42.014
It will only improve
when you set me free.

595
00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:43.277
Never!

596
00:37:50.892 --> 00:37:52.621
Look at the coral!

597
00:37:52.693 --> 00:37:56.060
Soon all Oceana will be like
this if Eris isn't stopped.

598
00:37:56.264 --> 00:37:59.028
I don't think the coral
is our only problem.

599
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.330

But they're huge!

602
00:38:08.776 --> 00:38:11.370
Any chance giant
jellyfish are friendly?

603
00:38:11.446 --> 00:38:14.540
ZUMA: Just the opposite.
Their shocks are deadly.

604
00:38:14.615 --> 00:38:17.482
And they're very
protective of their homes.

605
00:38:17.552 --> 00:38:19.986

go after the rest of us,
