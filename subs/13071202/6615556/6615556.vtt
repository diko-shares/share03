1
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.016
Super Monsters!

2
00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.892
<i>Día de los monsters.</i>

3
00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.110
Are you excited for our trip?

4
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.403
For sure!

5
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.573
I can't wait
to celebrate <i>Día de los Muertos</i>.

6
00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.200
- In the amazing Monster Town!
- Me too!

7
00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.663
I can't wait to meet Vida's grandfather
and see his <i>hacienda</i>.

8
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.874
Vida says it's magical!

9
00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.209
It sounds amazing!

10
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.087
Sure you don't want to come with us?

11
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:51.217
I'd like to, but I don't want
to miss Halloween. It's the…

12
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.136
…best night of the year!

13
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.932
Halloween is amazing,
but so is <i>Día de los Muertos</i>!

14
00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:02.604
I wish there was a way
we could be in both places at once.

15
00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:06.733
Me too! Katya,
don't you have a spell we could use?

16
00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.488
I wish I did! Sometimes it's so hard
to choose what to do.

17
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:16.159
It is, but it wouldn't be Halloween
without vampires and witches.

18
00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.079
And mummies and dragons too!

19
00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.122
So much fun!

20
00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.130
What's wrong, Albert?

21
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:35.345
Oh, Vida! I still haven't worked out
the ending for our dance.

22
00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.348
Oh, it's OK. I know you'll get it.

23
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.599
I hope so.

24
00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:45.522
I just want our dance to be really good…
and big… and…

25
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.940
<i>Fantástico?</i>

26
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.068
Yeah, <i>fantástico</i>!

27
00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.822
Don't worry, Albert, it will be.

28
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.158
Your dance
for the <i>Día de los Muertos </i>parade?

29
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:58.743
I love parades!

30
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.247
Me too! And I can't wait
to visit my hometown

31
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.667
and celebrate the holiday
with all my friends.

32
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.754
Look! It's almost time! Sun down…

33
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.090
…Monsters up!

34
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.092
Super Monsters!

35
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:16.678
Oh, I love it when you do that!

36
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.471
It's so cool!

37
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.104
Who's ready to go to Monster Town?

38
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.772
We are!

39
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:32.068
Let's go, my friends!
What are you waiting for? Hop in!

40
00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:37.532
Hey, Vida!
Bring us something from your hometown!

41
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.659
OK, I promise.

42
00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:41.119
<i>Adiós.</i>

43
00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.707
- Bye!
- See you soon!

44
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.460
Grrbus, ready!

45
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.963
Grrbus, zoom!

46
00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.889
Cool!

47
00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.224
<i>Hola.</i>

48
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.519
Vida, my darling!

49
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.938
<i>Hola, papá.</i>

50
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.406
Everyone, this is my <i>abuelo</i>:
Papá José.

51
00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.866
Welcome.

52
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.702
Papá, these are my friends.

53
00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.371
Albert, Frankie, Zoe.

54
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.873
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.751
And, of course, cousin Lobo!

56
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.711
<i>Hola, </i>Papá José.

57
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:36.090
Ah, Lobo! I almost didn't recognize you.

58
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.217
You've grown.

59
00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.678
Did you hear that? I've grown!

60
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.726
And you must be Grrbus.
Vida has told me all about you.

61
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.355
Thank you
for bringing everyone here safely.

62
00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:51.522
<i>De nada.</i>

63
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.068
Why don't you show your friends around?

64
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.363
Great idea! Come on everybody, follow me!

65
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.659
I wonder where Vida's friends are.
I want to meet them!

66
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:06.579
I do too!
I'm sure they must be here somewhere…

67
00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.628
This place is amazing!

68
00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.382
Isn't it wonderful? Nacho, Pepita,

69
00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:21.552
Fuego, Jackie and I have
so many fun adventures here!

70
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.431
Because everything is protected
by <i>Calavera </i>Magic,

71
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.393
we're safe no matter where we go.

72
00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:32.105
- Will we get to meet your friends?
- I hope so!

73
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.565
I'm sure they're here somewhere…

74
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:38.778
What was that?

75
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.324
I'll show you our float for the parade!

76
00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.578
That's our <i>Día de los Muertos </i>float?

77
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.458
It will be,
but first we need to decorate it.

78
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.961
I'll make <i>papel picado </i>banners!

79
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.254
<i>Fantástico.</i>

80
00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:00.466
<i>Papel picado </i>banners are a great way
to celebrate any holiday.

81
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.304
- I'm in charge of sugar skull balloons!
<i>- Perfecto.</i>

82
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.930
I'll add marigolds.

83
00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.975
Flowers and sugar skulls
are an important part

84
00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:12.103
of how we celebrate
<i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

85
00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:15.440
And I'll add the fairy lights, because…

86
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.234
everyone loves fairy lights, right?

87
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.114
- Yeah, they do!
- I'll work on the ending to the dance.

88
00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:28.453
- Great, we all have a job to do.
- Well… what are we waiting for?

89
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.020
I still don't know
what to do for the ending.

90
00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.565
Keep working on it.
You're such a good dancer.

91
00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.610
I know you'll come up
with something <i>fabuloso</i>!

92
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.238
What?

93
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.662
- Here you go, Papá José.
- Thank you, Vida.

94
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:16.000
Don't worry.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

95
00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.503
All… the time?

96
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.893
That's it! That's the perfect move
to end our dance!

97
00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:37.772
Wait! Show me how you did that!

98
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:43.903
Hey, wait…

99
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.492
Come back!

100
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:52.453
Wait! Stop!

101
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.882
Feeling good and looking great!

102
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.550
What?

103
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.678
The name is Nacho!

104
00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.264
You're Nacho?

105
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:13.141
You're Vida's friend?

106
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.435
I am! And who are you?

107
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.186
I'm Albert.

108
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.355
Alberto? I like it!

109
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.440
Up top!

110
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.986
You're a short one, aren't ya?

111
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.404
Got ya!

112
00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:31.367
So, Alberto, what's the word?
What are you doing out here?

113
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:36.622
I'm looking for a magical creature
who's an amazing dancer!

114
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.250
Oh, you mean like this?

115
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.548
Not quite what I was looking for…

116
00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:51.554
I'm just playing! I can't dance,
but I know exactly who you're looking for.

117
00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:52.555
You do?

118
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:57.143
Yeah. That girl's got some serious moves.
Follow me!

119
00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.354
We'll be able to see better from up there.

120
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.823
See anything?

121
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.283
Hang on.

122
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.828
Yep, there she is.

123
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.038
That way!

124
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.833
Come on, jump! I'll catch you!

125
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.418
Are you sure?

126
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.087
It'll be good. I promise.

127
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.301
Told you. I'm super strong.

128
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.728
What's that?

129
00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:44.564
What?

130
00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:48.319
Look out!

131
00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:55.993
Pepita! Seriously, you've got to work
on those brakes.

132
00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.204
Yeah, sorry about that.

133
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.127
You're a flying <i>burro</i>!

134
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.004
That's amazing!

135
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:12.051
Thanks! Flying's the easy part.
It's the sudden stops I have trouble with.

136
00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.594
So… who are you?

137
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:14.762
I'm Albert.

138
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.807
Or you can call me Alberto.

139
00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:23.729
Alberto? Hello! Hi! <i>Hola. </i>I'm Pepita!
Wanna be my friend? Let's be friends!

140
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.275
Nacho, I have a new friend,
but you'll always be my friend.

141
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:32.321
Alberto here is looking for
an amazing dancer he was following.

142
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.199
I need her help
with the ending of my dance.

143
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.951
I said we can help find her.

144
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:41.372
Absolutely! I'll help find her. I want to.
Do you? Let's go find her!

145
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:46.919
But first, I have one question.
Do you know how to ride a flying <i>burro</i>?

146
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.714
I can try.

147
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.632
Good, climb on board!

148
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.972
- This is so cool!
- I should probably warn you.

149
00:09:58.055 --> 00:10:01.684
- She likes to do tricks.
- What do you mean, she likes to...

150
00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.019
<i>Adiós, </i>Nacho.

151
00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:11.193
Pepita, you're amazing!

152
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.530
I know! I keep telling people that.

153
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.158
Do you see her? Where is she?

154
00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:20.661
Wait, are those sparkles?

155
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.623
I don't see anything.

156
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.250
You know what that means?

157
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.960
- What?
- More flying…

158
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.046
and more tricks!

159
00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:34.925
Yeah!

160
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.861
Told you, I'm great at flying!

161
00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.447
Just not so good on the landing.

162
00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.454
It looks amazing!

163
00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:05.456
- It's amazing!
- So good!

164
00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:10.711
It's fantastic!
It will be the best float in the parade.

165
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.630
You really think so?

166
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:18.302
- Everyone will love the dance we do on it.
- They sure will!

167
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:21.639
Albert, how are you doing
with the ending dance moves?

168
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.057
Albert?

169
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.267
Where did he go?

170
00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:29.397
Oh no! He must have wandered off!

171
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.565
Now, now… don't be nervous.

172
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.236
Even though it's a large area,
this land is very safe.

173
00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.196
- It is?
- Oh yes.

174
00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:42.284
And never forget:
our land has <i>Calavera </i>Magic.

175
00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:49.458
I know Albert is safe,
but we still have to find him.

176
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:53.462
Vida's right. The parade is soon.
He's in charge of the dance.

177
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.716
Well, then let's go!

178
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.262
- We should probably help.
- They'll be fine.

179
00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.021
What's happening?

180
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.950
There he is! The Sky Guy!

181
00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:25.119
The Bird with the Word!

182
00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:26.996
The Wing King himself!

183
00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.165
My main man! Fue...

184
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:34.336
- I am Fuego!
- Dude, I was doing the intro!

185
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.088
You were taking too long.

186
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:40.009
- You know him?
- Yeah, we're mates. We hang out.

187
00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.472
Hey, Fuego! Next time give us
a little warning before you land!

188
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.934
Nah, where's the fun in that?

189
00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:51.854
And who is this?

190
00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.397
Alberto!

191
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.942
And what brings you out here,
young Alberto?

192
00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:59.153
I was following the sparkles.

193
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:03.073
Ah, don't tell me.
She was dancing, am I right?

194
00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:08.913
She was! She was the most amazing,
most incredible dancer I've ever seen!

195
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:14.251
Well, when we find her,
be sure to tell her how good she is.

196
00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:18.172
- She likes hearing that.
- You'll help me find her?

197
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:19.882
Hop on!

198
00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.347
He's not as fun as me!
He doesn't like to do tricks.

199
00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:27.932
That's OK.

200
00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:31.060
Pepita's right. I don't do tricks.

201
00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.814
Who needs tricks
when you can fly as high as I can?

202
00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.690
How high is that?

203
00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:39.610
Hang on and I'll show you!

204
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.863
I'll come with you!

205
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.283
Show off!

206
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:54.458
I'm not sure I can see her
from way up here!

207
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.460
Don't worry, I can.

208
00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:01.173
Yep, I think I found something.

209
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.971
I think I found something!
That way. I saw sparkles!

210
00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:10.724
Sparkles? Were they gold and purple
with bits of green

211
00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.643
that look like pickle sweets?

212
00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:14.311
Yes, they were!

213
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:17.398
I know those sparkles! Let's go!

214
00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:45.508
Yeah!

215
00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.499
Yeah!

216
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.589
That's the dance move
I was telling you about!

217
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.800
These are my friends
I was telling you about!

218
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:30.679
And I'm the one
everyone is always talking about.

219
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.977
Oh, Jackie! You haven't changed.

220
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:38.604
Vida!

221
00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:43.484
Hello, my friends!
I'm so happy to see you all again!

222
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.778
And we're happy to see you!

223
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:47.237
Welcome back.

224
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:51.450
I missed you! Did you miss me?
Of course you did. How could you not?

225
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.453
Pepita! I missed all of you!

226
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.501
Everyone, this is Fuego,

227
00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:03.963
Nacho, Pepita, and Jackie.

228
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:07.716
- You've met Albert. This is Frankie.
- Hey!

229
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.510
- Lobo.
- Hello.

230
00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:11.303
- And Zoe.
- <i>Hola</i>.

231
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.058
Finally my new friends
get to meet my old friends!

232
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.019
I found you!

233
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.647
It took you long enough!

234
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.609
I did leave you a trail
of sparkles to follow!

235
00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:30.656
I know, thank you. But you were so fast,
it was hard to catch up.

236
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:35.285
Do you think you can show me
how you do that big dance move?

237
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:38.789
- I don't know. How much money you got?
- Money?

238
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:42.584
I'm kidding! I'm a jackalope.
What am I gonna do with money?

239
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.296
Of course I'll show you
how to do my dance!

240
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.884
Great, thank you! We better hurry,
the parade is going to start soon!

241
00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.219
Albert's right!

242
00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:54.638
And we still have a lot to do.

243
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.711
Sorry, everyone. I have some bad news.

244
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.172
What's wrong, Papá José?

245
00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:31.341
The tractor meant
to pull the float won't start.

246
00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.509
Oh no!

247
00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:36.847
How can we dance in the parade
if we don't have a float?

248
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.350
- What do we do?
- I don't know what we can do.

249
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.896
Need help?

250
00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:45.481
Grrbus!

251
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.316
Grrbus can help us!

252
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:04.166
- Is everybody ready?
- Ready!

253
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:13.717
<i>It's been, oh, oh, oh
So long, oh, oh, oh</i>

254
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.970
<i>Since I've seen your smile</i>

255
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.933
<i>But now we are together again</i>

256
00:18:21.016 --> 00:18:24.394
<i>Sí, cariño, it's been a while</i>

257
00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:29.274
<i>So we honour all the monsters
That came before</i>

258
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.111
<i>Ay, qué bueno verte de nuevo</i>

259
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:36.698
<i>It's the day that we celebrate</i>

260
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:40.494
<i>El Día de los Muertos
Día de los Muertos</i>

261
00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:44.498
<i>Día de los Muertos…</i>

262
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.209
Alberto! Get ready to catch me!

263
00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:50.420
That's not a good idea!

264
00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.090
I caught you, now you catch me!

265
00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.805
Bet you didn't see that coming!

266
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:11.567
<i>It's the day that we celebrate</i>

267
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.362
<i>El Día de los Muertos
Día de los Muertos</i>

268
00:19:15.445 --> 00:19:19.074
<i>Día de los Muertos</i>

269
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.120
<i>Juntos, estamos juntos de nuevo</i>

270
00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.621
<i>Together…</i>

271
00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:25.705
Jackie?

272
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.044
- Ready to help us with the ending?
- Who, me? I couldn't.

273
00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.713
Please?

274
00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:36.216
OK, give me some room. Here we go!

275
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:38.427
Follow me!

276
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.681
<i>So we honour all the monsters
That came before</i>

277
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.350
<i>Fue tan bueno verte de nuevo</i>

278
00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:49.938
<i>It's the day that we celebrate</i>

279
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:54.026
<i>El Día de los Muertos
Día de los Muertos</i>

280
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.905
<i>Día de los Muertos…</i>

281
00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.456
He gets me every time!

282
00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:09.666
<i>Estamos juntos de nuevo</i>

283
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.043
<i>Together</i>

284
00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:13.545
<i>We are together again…</i>

285
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:26.600
Vida!

286
00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:31.730
You and your friends made
this celebration so special.

287
00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:33.649
It was so much fun!

288
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:37.402
Thanks so much for everything.

289
00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:41.865
- I will miss you, my darling.
- And I'm going to miss you.

290
00:20:55.545 --> 00:21:01.385
- Wait, what about your animal friends?
- We didn't get chance to say goodbye.

291
00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:06.098
That's OK. I'll say goodbye
to the animalsfor you.

292
00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:07.391
Even Nacho?

293
00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:09.268
Especially Nacho.

294
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:14.690
- Do you think we'll ever see them again?
- I have a feeling we will.

295
00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:20.612
See you later. Come back again soon!

296
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:23.699
Grrbus ready!

297
00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.826
Grrbus zoom!

298
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.328
Goodbye!

299
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.963
- So cool!
- How was your trip? Good?

300
00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:39.881
How was <i>Día de los Muertos</i>?

301
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.010
- It was really fun!
- How was Halloween?

302
00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:48.348
- It was spooktacular!
- We even saved a little something for you!

303
00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:54.604
Did you bring us something
from your hometown?

304
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:56.356
Actually, we did.

305
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.441
We did?

306
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.235
Yes, we did. Look!

307
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.613
<i>Hola, </i>Pitchfork Pines.

308
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.455
Who is that?

309
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:13.874
I am Fuego!

310
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.544
I'm Pepita!

311
00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:21.089
I'm Jackie!

312
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:24.926
And I'm Nacho!

313
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:29.639
Meet our friends!

314
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:30.723
Yeah!

315
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:36.146
You really brought back something special.

316
00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:40.984
- That's not all we brought.
- What else did you bring?

317
00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:46.156
We brought back a new dance!
