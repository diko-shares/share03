I can't wait to meet
Vida's grandfather

11
00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.347
and see his <i>hacienda</i>.

12
00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:40.750
Vida says it's really magical!

13
00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:43.127
It sounds amazing!

you don't want to come with us?

15
00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:48.048
[hesitates] I'd like to,

16
00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.385
but I don't want
to miss Halloween. It's the...

17
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.262
[all] ...best night of the year!

18
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.223
Halloween is awesome,

19
00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:57.892
but so is <i>Día de los Muertos</i>!

20
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.270
Oh, I wish there was
a way we could all be

21

in both places at once.

22
00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:06.400
Me too! Katya, don't you have
a spell we could use?

23
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.683
[chuckles] I wish I did!

24
00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.238
Sometimes it's so hard
to choose what to do.

25
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.532
It is,

26
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.827
but it wouldn't be Halloween
without vampires and witches.

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.747
And mummies and dragons too!

- Come on everybody, follow me!

Fuego, Jackie and I had
so many fun adventures here!

we're always safe
no matter where we go.

Oh...

108
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.705
That's our <i>Día de los Muertos</i>
parade float?

109
00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:50.333
[Vida] Well... it will be,

110
00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:52.502
but first we need to decorate it.

111
00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:54.920
I'll make <i>papel picado </i>banners!

112
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.245
[speaking Spanish] <i>Fantástico.</i>

113
00:04:56.297 --> 00:05:00.343
<i>Papel picado </i>banners are a great way
to celebrate any holiday.

114
00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.887
I'm in charge of the sugar skull balloons!

[speaking Spanish] <i>Perfecto.</i>

116
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.860
And I'll add the marigolds,

117
00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:08.970
because flowers and sugar skulls
are an important part

118
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.937
of how we celebrate
<i>Día de los Muertos.</i>

119
00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:15.358
And I'll add the twinkle lights,
because... um...

120
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.385
because everyone loves twinkle lights!

121
00:05:17.468 --> 00:05:18.778
- Right?

122
00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:20.697

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.223
- You do?
- Oh, yeah!

182
00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:55.682
That girl's got some serious moves.

183
00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:57.270
Come on, follow me!

184
00:07:57.687 --> 00:07:59.768
We'll be able to get
a better look from up there.

[music]

187
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.280
[Albert] Whoa!

188
00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.992
You see anything?

189
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:12.452
Hang on.

190
00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:16.622
Yep, there she is. That way!

191
00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:17.957
[pants]

192
00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.877
Come on, jump! I'll catch you!

193
00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:22.545
Are you sure?

194
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:25.005
It'll be good. I promise.

195
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.548
[pants]

196
00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:29.010
- [cheers]
- Told you, kid.

197
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:30.385
I'm super strong.

198
00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:32.178
[music]

199
00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:39.270
- [flutter]
- What...?

200
00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:40.688
[Albert stutters] What's that?

201
00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:44.025
Huh? What?

202
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.695
- [Pepita] Look out!
- Whoa!

203
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:51.282
[groan]

204
00:08:51.907 --> 00:08:53.030
Pepita!

205
00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:55.828
Seriously, you've got to work
on those brakes.

206
00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:57.747
Yeah, sorry about that.

207
00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:00.833
Uh...

208
00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:04.875
You're a flying <i>burro</i>!

209
00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:07.005
That's amazing!

210
00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.382
Ah, thanks!

211
00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:09.922
Flying's the easy part.

212
00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.843
It's the sudden stops
I have trouble with.

213
00:09:11.927 --> 00:09:13.512
So... who are you?

214
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:14.805
I'm Albert.

215
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.933
Or you can call me Alberto.

216
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.518
Alberto? Hello! Hi! <i>Hola.</i>

217
00:09:20.603 --> 00:09:22.597
I'm Pepita!
Want to be my friend?

218
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.873
I'll be your friend.
Let's be friends!

219
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.400
Nacho, I have a new friend,
but you'll always be my friend too.

220
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.523
[laughs]

221
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.072
Alberto here is looking
for an amazing dancer

222
00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:32.448
he was following.

223
00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:35.158
I need her to help me
with the ending of my dance.

224
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.077
I told him we can help him find her.

225
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.408
Oh, absolutely!

226
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.638
I'll help you find her.
I want to find her.

227
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.382
Do you wanna go find her?
Let's go find her!

228
00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.252
But first, I just have one question.

229
00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:47.045
Do you know how to ride
a flying <i>burro</i>?

230
00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:49.632
Uh... I can try.

231
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.717
Good, climb on board!

232
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:56.180
Whoa... this is so cool!

233
00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:57.928
I should probably warn you.

234
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.558
She likes to do tricks.

235
00:09:59.642 --> 00:10:01.560
What do you mean, she likes to do...
[shouts]

236
00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:03.204
[Pepita speaking Spanish]
<i>Adiós, </i>Nacho.

237
00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:06.523
- [Albert] Whoa!
- [Pepita laughs]

238
00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:08.483
[Pepita] Woo-hoo!

239
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:11.153
Pepita, you're amazing!

240
00:10:11.237 --> 00:10:12.530
[giggles] I know!

241
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:14.282
I keep telling people that.

242
00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.575
Do you see her? Where is she?

243
00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.705
Wait, are those sparkles over there?

244
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.290
Nope, I don't see anything.

245
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.002
And you know what that means?

246
00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.167
- What?
- More flying...

247
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.047
and more tricks!

248
00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.298
[gasps]

249
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.885
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

250
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.928
[music]

251
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.182
[laughs]

252
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.475
[music]

253
00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.312
[Pepita laughs]

254
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:47.773
[Pepita] Whoa!

255
00:10:47.857 --> 00:10:49.317
[Albert groans]

256
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.315
Whoa!

257
00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.858
I told you, I'm great at flying!

258
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.657
Just not so good on the landing.
[chuckles]

259
00:10:57.617 --> 00:11:00.327
[both laugh]

260
00:11:01.412 --> 00:11:03.455
It looks awesome!

261
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.809
- [Zoe] Yes! It's amazing!
- [Lobo] Yes, it's so good!

262
00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.752
[speaking Spanish]
<i>Qué fantástico.</i>

263
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.713
It will be the best float at the parade.

264
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.673
You really think so?

265
00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:16.927
Everyone is going to love the dance
we do on it.

266
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.175
They sure are!

267
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:21.057
Albert, how are you doing
with the ending dance moves?

268
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.850
Um... Albert?

269
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:24.977
Oh. Where did he go?

270
00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:27.730
Oh, no!

271
00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:29.398
He must have wandered off!

272
00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.397
Now, now... don't be nervous.

273
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:35.403
Even though it's a large area,
this land is very safe.

274
00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:37.490
- It is?
- [speaking Spanish] <i>Oh, sí.</i>

275
00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:42.537
And never forget:
our land has <i>Calavera </i>Magic.

276
00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:49.502
I know Albert is safe,
but we still have to find him.

277
00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:50.808
Vida's right.

278
00:11:50.892 --> 00:11:53.505
The parade is soon,
and he's in charge of the dance.

279
00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.175
Well, then let's go! [howls]

280
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.302
[music]

281
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.220
We should probably help, right?

282
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.597
They will be fine.

283
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.558
[music]

284
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.562
- [thunder]
- [all gasp]

285
00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:10.982
What's happening?

286
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.775
[music]

287
00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:20.448
Whoa!

288
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.868
There he is! The Sky Guy!

289
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:25.037
The Bird With the Word!

290
00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.955
The Wing King himself!

291
00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.375
My main man! Fue...

292
00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:32.168
I am Fuego!

293
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.338
Dude, I was doing the intro!

294
00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:35.923
You were taking too long.

295
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.092
You know him?

296
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:40.093
Oh, yeah, we're buds.
We hang out.

297
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.425
[Pepita] Hey, Fuego!

298
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:44.013
Next time give us a little warning
before you land!

299
00:12:44.182 --> 00:12:46.475
- [Fuego laughs]
- [Pepita] Whoa!

300
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.060
No, where's the fun in that?

301
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:51.813
And who is this?

302
00:12:51.897 --> 00:12:53.398
Alberto!

303
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:56.985
And what brings you out here,
young Alberto?

304
00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.238
I was following the sparkles.

305
00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:00.820
Ah, don't tell me.

306
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.117
She was dancing, am I right?

307
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.407
Yes, she was!

308
00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:07.410
And she was the most amazing,
most incredible dancer

309
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.038
I've ever seen!

310
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:11.208
Well, when we find her,

311
00:13:11.298 --> 00:13:14.212
you be sure to tell her
how good she is.

312
00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:15.960
She likes hearing that.

313
00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:18.340
So you'll help me find her?

314
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.842
Hop on!

315
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.135
[music]

316
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.343
Just so you know,
he's not as much fun as me!

317
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:25.890
He doesn't like to do tricks.

318
00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:27.892
Oh... that's OK.

319
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:31.187
Pepita's right.
I don't do tricks.

320
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.565
Who needs tricks
when you can fly as high as I can?

321
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.647
Um... how high is that?

322
00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.570
Hang on and I'll show you!

323
00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:43.115
Oh, I'll come with you!

324
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.535
Oh, show off!

325
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:54.000
I'm not sure I can see her
from way up here!

326
00:13:54.418 --> 00:13:56.712
Don't worry, I can.

327
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.008
Yeah, I think I found something.

328
00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.762
[Zoe] I think I found something!

329
00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.805
That way! I saw some sparkles!

330
00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.345
Sparkles?

331
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.748
Were they gold and purple
with little bits of green

332
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.728
that look like pickle jelly candies?

333
00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:14.397
Yes, they were!

334
00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.273
I know those sparkles!
