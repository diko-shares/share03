 gentle, noble melody )

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.085

GIRL:
 Once upon a time,
 in a faraway kingdom,

6
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:47.480
 lived a beautiful little girl
 and her widowed father.

7
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.619
It's beautiful.

8
00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.687
GIRL:
 Okay, it wasn't that long ago.

9
00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.522
 And it wasn't really
 a faraway kingdom.

10
00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.557
( car horn honking,
 car alarm blaring )

11
00:00:58.557 --> 00:00:59.925
 It was
 the San Fernando Valley,

12
00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:01.594
 and it only looked far away

13
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.395
 because you could barely
 see it through all the smog.

14
00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:06.999
 But to me, growing up,
 the Valley was my kingdom.

15
00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.469
( upbeat pop melody plays )

16
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.938
( indistinct conversation )

17
00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.440
( girl giggles )

18
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.209
 I was my dad's best friend
 and he was mine.

♪ ...An everlasting love... ♪

20
00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.447
 Although being raised
 by a man put me behind

21
00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.981
 in the makeup and
 fashion departments,

22
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.918
 I never felt like
 I missed out on anything.

23
00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.320
( laughing )

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.422
 I was the luckiest
 girl in the world.

♪ I'm so glad
you found me in time... ♪

26
00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.562
 My dad owned the coolest
 diner in the whole Valley.

27
00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.031
 I loved hanging out there.

28
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:42.001
♪ This will be
an everlasting love for me... ♪

29
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.271
 It was the kind of place where
 "diet" was a four-letter word

30
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.941
 and grease came
 at no additional charge.

31
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.312
 At Hal's, everyone
 felt like family.

32
00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.180
WAITRESS:
All right,

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.215
I have drinks for everyone.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:59.718
( noisemaker tooting )

35
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:00.920
Happy birthday.

36
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.022
Make a wish,

37
00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.323
princess.

38
00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.825
GIRL:
 What did I need a wish for?

39
00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:10.296
 I had amazing friends
 and the coolest dad.

40
00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.867
WOMAN:
Oh!

41
00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.236
GIRL:
 But I guess my dad thought
 I needed one more thing--

42
00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:17.236
I am so sorry.

43
00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.673
 Fiona.

45
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.078
You look
beautiful, Fiona.

( cheering )

47
00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:32.752
GIRL:
 Along with my new stepmother
 came her twin daughters,

48
00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.355
 Brianna and Gabriella--
 my "out-of-step" sisters.

49
00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.023
FIONA:
Come on, girls.
Family photo.

50
00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.092
 But as long as my dad
 was happy, so was I.

51
00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:40.092
One... two...

52
00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:44.063
 We were going to be
 one big happy family.

53
00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.632
FIONA & DAUGHTERS:
Cheese!

54
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.334
One's enough.

55
00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.535
GIRL:
 Unfortunately,

56
00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.771
 this was no fairy tale.

57
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.839
DAD:
 "He took her hand

58
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:54.974
 "and he kissed it.

59
00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.477
 "Then he swooped her up
 onto his horse,

60
00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:01.313
"and the beautiful princess
and the handsome prince

61
00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.249
"rode off to his castle,

62
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.253
"where they
lived happily... ever...

63
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:07.253
( giggling )

64
00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.989
...after."

65
00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.658
Do fairy tales
come true, Dad?

66
00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:15.594
Well, no.

67
00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:17.797
But dreams come true.

68
00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:18.898
Do you have a dream?

69
00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.199
Yeah.

70
00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.068
My dream is that you'll
grow up and go to college,

71
00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:24.203
and then maybe someday

72
00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.372
you'll build
your own castle.

73
00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.976
Where do princesses
go to college?

74
00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.276
Uh...

75
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:33.279
they go, uh....

76
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.447
um, where the princes go.

77
00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.450
They go to Princeton.

78
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.685
But Sam, you know,

79
00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.253
fairy tales aren't just about

80
00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.555
finding handsome princes.

81
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.890
They're about
fulfilling your dreams,

82
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.461
and about standing up
for what you believe in.

83
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.829
It's just like
I always say--

84
00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.098
never let the fear of
striking out keep...

85
00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.266
...keep you from
playing the game.

86
00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.067
That's right.

87
00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.436
( chuckles )

88
00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.937
And, just remember,
if you look carefully,

89
00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:00.339
this book contains
important things

90
00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.544
that you may need
to know later in life.

91
00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.384

92
00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.186

 My kingdom came crumbling down

95
00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:19.391
 the day the Northridge
 earthquake struck the Valley.

96
00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.360
FIONA:
Help! Help!

97
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.494
Don't go!

98
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.398
I'll be right back.

99
00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:37.310
 I lost
 my best friend that day.

100
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.612
 And, from then on,
 the only fairy tales in my life

101
00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:45.318
 were the ones
 I read about in books.

102
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.158
 Since my father
 didn't leave a will,

103
00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:54.226
 my stepmother got everything.

how extraordinarily gifted

I can tell.

156
00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.451
You know, it costs a fortune

157
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.488
to fly that stuff in
from Norwegia.

158
00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:05.892
And push it, ladies.
Push it, ladies.

159

Push it, ladies.

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:06.658
Ready? Okay.

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.694

Ew! Gross!

Mom!

165
00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.368
I have
a spastic colon.

166
00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:19.371
Well, you have
a spastic brain!

167

168
00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.107
Stop! Stop hitting her.
Stop it. Stop it!

169
00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:24.510
What are you doing
just standing there?

170
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.844
Get to work.

171
00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:27.279
Fiona, I can't go
to work this morning.

172
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:29.882
I've got a really big test
I have to study for.

173
00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:30.983
Listen, Sam.

174
00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:35.487
People go to school
to get smarter

175
00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:38.490
so that they
can get a job.

176
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.758
You already have a job.

177
00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.693
So it's like skipping a step.

178
00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:44.230
Come on, get going.

179
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.701
And Flying Karamazov!

180
00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:50.269

181
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.738

182
00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.343
FIONA:
No, honey.

183
00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.510
Leave those on.

184
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:59.879
The lawn's looking

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.910
( gasping )

370
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.178
Greetings.

371
00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.446
Samantha, you look
absolutely stunning today,

372
00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:09.582
as per usual.

373
00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:10.850
Oh, thank you,
Terry.

374
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.850
( beeping )

375
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.117
Oh, if you'll excuse me.

376
00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:15.321
I must get back
to my galaxy now.

377
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.357
Zion? Lieutenant
Terry here.

378
00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.091
Hello?

379
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.760
Can you hear me?
Captain?

380
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.262
You're going
in and out.

381
00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:23.962
Poor guy.

382
00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:25.797
At least he's happy.

383
00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:25.797
Oh, I copy.

384
00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.099
Happy?!

385
00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:29.234
The guy lives in
another world.

386
00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:32.104
Sometimes fantasy is better
than reality, Carter.

387
00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.905
( cell phone ringing )

388
00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:37.176
( clears throat )

389
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.078
Speaking of fantasy.

390
00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:41.280
I'll see you later.

391
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.886
Ah, yes,
the secret admirer beckons.

392
00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.358
BOY'S VOICE:
Where have you been?

393
00:14:53.358 --> 00:14:55.627
We haven't talked in ages.

394
00:14:55.627 --> 00:14:59.832
We talked this morning.

395
00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.701
I can't stop
thinking about you.

396
00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.604
What's on your mind right now?

397
00:15:06.838 --> 00:15:10.108
You... first.

398
00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:11.509
Well, I'm thinking

399
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:14.012
that Professor
Rothman's dissected

400
00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:15.847

Laugh out loud.

Oh, I want to

408

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:03.561
( Sam groans )

417
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:05.230
SAM:
 Raging stepmom, work,

418
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.200
 and cool kids who can't
 get over themselves.

419
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.135
 Ever feel
 like you don't belong?

420
00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.569
AUSTIN:
 Absolutely.

421
00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:13.905
 I can be surrounded
 by a sea of people

422
00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:15.774
 and still feel all alone.

423
00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:17.909
 Then I think of you.

424
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.181
SAM:
 Hey, Nomad, do you think
 we've ever met?

425
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:25.383
AUSTIN:
 I don't know.

426
00:16:25.383 --> 00:16:28.320
 Our school has over 3,500 kids.

427
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.189
SAM:
 Well, that narrows it down.

428
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.857
( Austin chuckles )

429
00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:34.293
AUSTIN:
 Well, at least I can
 eliminate the guys.

430
00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:35.894
 You're not a guy, right?

431
00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:38.563
 'Cause if you are,
 I'll kick your butt.

432
00:16:38.563 --> 00:16:41.299
SAM ( chuckles ):
 I am not a guy.

433
00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:44.869
 Have you told your dad
 about Princeton yet?

434
00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:46.471
AUSTIN:
 If only I could.

435
00:16:46.471 --> 00:16:48.740
 I haven't even told him
 I want to be a writer.

436
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.478
SAM:
 My father always encouraged me
 to pursue my dreams.

437
00:16:53.478 --> 00:16:54.847
AUSTIN:
 Not mine.

438
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.849
 He has a whole
 nother plan for my life.

439
00:16:57.849 --> 00:16:59.618
SAM:
 It's 2:00 a.m.

440
00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:01.219
 We've been at this
 for five hours.

441
00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:03.455
AUSTIN ( chuckles ):
 Well, I think

442
00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:04.888
 we broke our record.

443
00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:07.658
SAM ( chuckles ):
 We should turn in.

444
00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.060
 Sweet dreams.

445
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.896
AUSTIN:
 Wait...

446
00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.366
 ...I can't sleep without
 knowing there's hope.

447
00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.502
 "Half the night
 I waste in sighs.

448

 "...the eyes...

453
00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:32.217
 for the meeting of tomorrow."

454
00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.952
SAM:
 Quoting Tennyson. Impressive.

455
00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:38.323
AUSTIN:
 Please meet me
 at the Homecoming Dance.

456
00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:39.758
 I'll be waiting
 for you at 11:00

457
00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:42.828
 in the middle
 of the dance floor.

458
00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:48.400
Sweet dreams.

459
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.603
( sighs )

460
00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.571
Oh!

461
00:17:53.571 --> 00:17:54.706
CARTER:
That was close.

462
00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:55.907
Sam, this is great.

463
00:17:55.907 --> 00:17:57.409
You're finally
going to be able to meet him.

464
00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.813
I don't know; this guy
is too good to be true.

465
00:18:01.813 --> 00:18:02.681
( grunts )

466
00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.048
( whimpers )

467
00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:05.717
Come on!

468
00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.687
It's been, like, a month since
you met him in that Princeton

469
00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:09.721
chat room, okay?

470
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:10.522
You talk to him

471
00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.123
all the time-- you know him.

472
00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:12.991
I know,

473
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.459
but he doesn't know me.

474
00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:16.060
What if I meet him,
and I'm not what he expects?

475
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.365
Maybe this whole relationship's
just better for cyberspace.

476
00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:21.833
( grunts )

477
00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:23.836
Ow! Ow! Ow!

478
00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.670
Listen.

479
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.673
Okay? You have to go
to that dance, okay?

480
00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:29.708
Th-This Nomad guy
isn't going to be

481
00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:32.310
in one place for long,
all right?

482
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.646
If it helps,
I'll be your escort.

483
00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:36.148
Really?

484
00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.082
Yeah.

485
00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:39.851
You rock, Carter.

486
00:18:39.851 --> 00:18:43.121
( phone rings )

487
00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:44.722
Hello?

488
00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:49.794
Sam? Some little brat got
into my salmon and ate it all.

489
00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:51.330
I need more salmon!

490
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.832
And pick up my dry cleaning.

491
00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.067
And wash the Jag.

492
00:18:56.434 --> 00:18:58.070
( sighs )

493
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.171
Fiona.

494
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.205
One more pitch.

495
00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.506
Why do you act like her slave?

496
00:19:01.506 --> 00:19:05.143
Simple-- no Fiona,
no money for Princeton.

497
00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.011
That sucks.

498
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.178
Tell me about it.

499
00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:08.547
( exhales )

500
00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:11.550
FIONA'S VOICE:
Nya-nya, nya-nya, nya-nya...

501
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.953
( Fiona-Ball screaming )

502
00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.889
CARTER:
Hey, it's outta here!

503
00:19:21.893 --> 00:19:23.561
( whooping )

504
00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:24.663
Damn, a girl hit that!

505
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.164
See, now that's impressive.

506
00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.733
So, what are you and Shelby
going to the dance as?

507
00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.769
( sighs )

508
00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.171
I don't know if I'm
going with Shelby.

509
00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:35.340
You're not going to go
with Shelby?

510
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.342
Who else you gonna
go with?

511
00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:39.110
I don't know.

512
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.145
It's a mystery to me.

513
00:19:41.145 --> 00:19:42.381
Thank you!

514
00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.215
You're welcome!

515
00:19:44.215 --> 00:19:45.484
MR. AMES:
Okay, you guys,

516
00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.852
come on, a little bit further,
a little bit.

517
00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:49.854
There. Right there.

518
00:19:49.854 --> 00:19:51.957
"30% off

519
00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.124

520
00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:54.259
AUSTIN:
Hey, Miguel. ¿Como esta?

521
00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:56.828
( Miguel speaking Spanish )

522
00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.129
Looks good, my friend.

523
00:19:58.129 --> 00:19:59.998
Now, just make sure you
get these rims, all right?

524
00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:00.932
He's a good guy.

525
00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:00.932
Austin...

526
00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:02.534
What's up?

527
00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:05.303
What's with all those college
brochures in your bedroom?

528
00:20:05.303 --> 00:20:07.839
What are you
doing in my room?

529
00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:11.409
I'm just trying to
keep my options open.

530
00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:13.077
You don't need any options.

531
00:20:13.077 --> 00:20:15.013
It is all taken care of.

532
00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:17.415
Look, son...

533
00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:19.217
we have been working
on this program

534
00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:20.651
since you were
nine years old.

535
00:20:20.651 --> 00:20:22.153
You're going to go play
USC football,

536
00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:25.223
you're going to graduate,
and then you're going to manage

537
00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:26.291
this business with me.

538
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.026
Your future's set,

539
00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:30.095
so don't mess with the plan,

540
00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:31.329
all right?

541
00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:33.298
Wouldn't think of it.

542
00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.033
There's another
customer.

543
00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.768
Go make 'em happy.

544
00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.270
( worker whistles )

545
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.073
WORKER:
Yes, sir,
ease your car in...

546
00:20:42.073 --> 00:20:44.676
Well, you need a wax.

547
00:20:45.176 --> 00:20:46.845
Excuse me?

548
00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:49.080
I meant the car.

549
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.716
Oh. Fine.

550
00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:53.652
( car horn playing "Battle Hymn
 of the Republic" )

551
00:20:53.652 --> 00:21:02.060
( second car horn playing
 "Dixie" )

552
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.261
Austin!

553
00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:05.397
Hi! We need our
cars washed!

554
00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.731
Yeah, look!

555
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:07.498
Dirt!

556
00:21:07.498 --> 00:21:10.202
( girls giggling )

557
00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:11.703
AUSTIN:
One second, ladies.

558
00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:12.737
All right.

559
00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:14.272
Take this inside
when you're done.

560
00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:15.740
Thank you very much.

561
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.009
GABRIELLA:
Oh, my God.

562
00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.477
He is an angel!

563
00:21:19.477 --> 00:21:20.712
He's so cute!

564
00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:21.813
I know it!

565
00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.047
SAM:
So...

566
00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:26.050
who'd you guys pay
to make your cars so dirty?

567
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.252
Excuse me?

568
00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.487
Like, what are you,
the Dirt Police?

569
00:21:29.487 --> 00:21:31.456
( laughs ):
Yeah!

570
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.824
The Dirt Police!

571
00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:35.226
Like, excuse me, miss,
do you know how fast

572
00:21:35.226 --> 00:21:36.461
your dirt was going?

573
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.363
You should've stopped
at the Dirt Police.

574
00:21:39.363 --> 00:21:40.665
( sighs ):
Hmm.

575
00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:42.467
You know, you should
really get going,

576
00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.636
because our mom's
looking for you.

577
00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.103
Well, where is she?

578
00:21:46.103 --> 00:21:48.573
She's at home, baking.

579
00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.441
( door closes )

580
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:52.276
SAM:
You wanted to see me?

581
00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:53.545
Yes.

582
00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:55.847
( gasps )

583
00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:56.781
Oh, my...

584
00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:57.982
Yeah, did you finish
your errands?

585
00:21:57.982 --> 00:21:59.484
'Cause I need you
to head back

586
00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.254
to the diner
and take the night shift.

587
00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:03.755
Um, tonight's my night off,

588
00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:06.891
and, um, it's-it's the Halloween
Dance at school, so...

589
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:08.159
I know,

590
00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:10.361
but you need to stop being
so self-centered, Sam,

591
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:11.663
and start thinking of others,

592
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:14.266
and others need you
to go to the diner

593
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.933
and mop the floors tonight.

594
00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:17.102
But I...

595
00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.003
I really need to go
to this dance, Fiona.

596
00:22:19.003 --> 00:22:19.838
I have to.

597
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.139
Come on, Sam, you need to earn

598
00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:22.541
your tuition money for college.

599
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:24.543
You got to bus a lot of tables.

600
00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:27.012
Fiona, I'm a straight-A student.

601
00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:31.382
I work seven days a week,
and I'm taking extra AP classes.

602
00:22:31.382 --> 00:22:33.818
I never ask you for anything.

603
00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:34.552
Please,

604
00:22:34.552 --> 00:22:36.321
let me go to
this dance.

605
00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.022
( sighs )

606
00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:39.124
Sweetheart,

607
00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.092
now that you're
old enough,

608
00:22:41.092 --> 00:22:43.428
there's something
I've always wanted to tell you,

609
00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:45.630
and I think you're ready
to hear it.

610
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:51.603
You're not very pretty,
and you're not very bright.

611
00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:55.574
I'm so glad we had that talk.

612
00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.476
( sighs, lid crashes )

613
00:22:58.476 --> 00:22:59.978
( screams )

614
00:22:59.978 --> 00:23:01.679
♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoo ♪

615
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:02.914
♪ I need your love... ♪

616
00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.782
DAVID:
Hey, Austin, scoot over, bro.

617
00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:07.686
MADISON:
Caitlyn, move over.

618
00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.320
CAITLYN:
Give me a minute.

619
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.155
Ooh!

620
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.522
( gasps )

621
00:23:11.522 --> 00:23:13.925
You're in my way.

622
00:23:14.525 --> 00:23:17.095
Ooh, it must
be Halloween.

623
00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.229
Look what just flew in--

624
00:23:18.229 --> 00:23:19.730
the Wicked Witch
of the Valley.

625
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.731
( chuckling )

626
00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:22.267
I'm going to be picking up

627
00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.368
Gabriella and Brianna

628
00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:24.636
at the Halloween Dance.

629
00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:27.038
I'll be back by 12:00 sharp.

630
00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.506
Okay.

631
00:23:28.506 --> 00:23:29.874
( bell dinging )

632
00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:32.243
Ooh! Still got room
in there, huh?

633
00:23:32.243 --> 00:23:37.014
Well... if it isn't little
Betty Crocker from the 'hood.

634
00:23:37.281 --> 00:23:39.483
Don't you have something
more important to do,

635
00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:40.752
like cleaning toilets?

636
00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:41.953
You know, I would,

637
00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:44.222
but I'm too busy
running this place.

638
00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.857
But be my guest.

639
00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:49.561
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, 'cause
I just got a $150 manicure.

640
00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:51.696
Silver palm trees.

641
00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:52.997
Ooh.

642
00:23:52.997 --> 00:23:54.499
You know, keep it up, Fiona,
and I'm going to find

643
00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:57.368
a place to put
my six-dollar pedicure.

644
00:23:57.368 --> 00:23:58.637
Where are your skates?

645
00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.272
That's part of
the uniform.

646
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:03.407
Fiona, if I wanted to look like
a clown, I'd join the circus.

647
00:24:03.407 --> 00:24:06.477
If you were part of my circus,
I would have you cleaning

648
00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:08.780
the elephant butts
with a Wet One.

649
00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:11.416
I don't think you realize
that I could...

650
00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:12.984
Fire me? Oh, please,
go right ahead,

651
00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:16.922
and let's see how many customers
you have left when you do.

652
00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:23.462
I am a very
appealing person.

653
00:24:24.662 --> 00:24:26.064
( mumbling )

654
00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:28.767
Yeah, in your head.

655
00:24:30.301 --> 00:24:31.570
( door slams )

656
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.573
BOTH:
"I'm a very appealing person."

657
00:24:35.573 --> 00:24:36.975
That woman can make
a nun swear.

658
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:39.277
Why do you think I'm
graduating a year early

659
00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.679
so I can be 3,000 miles
away in Princeton?

660
00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:44.949
You could get a scholarship
to the University of Mars,

661
00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:47.284
and it still wouldn't be
far enough.

662
00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:48.386
( chuckles )

663
00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:49.920
Sammy, honey, I'm desperate.

664
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.190
Can you cover
that back booth for me?

665
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.026
I don't think I can
eat anything here.

666
00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:57.328
But, I...

667
00:24:57.328 --> 00:24:59.330
( sighs )

668
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.665
Why do I have the feeling

669
00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.001
I won't be able to get
a Zone meal here?

670
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.435
I already ate.

671
00:25:04.435 --> 00:25:05.637
Madison,

672
00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:06.838
laxatives don't qualify
as a food group.

673
00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.773
Surprised you didn't
know that.

674
00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.175
SHELBY:
Stop it.

675
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.376
Well,

676
00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:13.277
if it isn't diner girl.

677
00:25:13.277 --> 00:25:14.879
What can I get you guys?

678
00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:17.782
What can I get here
that has no sugar,

679
00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:20.218
no carbs and is fat-free?

680
00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:21.285
Water.

681
00:25:21.285 --> 00:25:22.386
DAVID:
Water? Feisty.

682
00:25:22.386 --> 00:25:24.956
Was that supposed
to be a joke?

683
00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.324
It was funny.

684
00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.725
I'll have a Vos.

685
00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:28.960
Excuse me?

686
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.094
It's water

687
00:25:30.094 --> 00:25:30.862
from Norway.

688
00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.163
SHELBY:
She's the worst!

689
00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.866
Sorry, we only have water
from the Valley.

690
00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:36.934
Oh, well, then I'll
have an iced tea.

691
00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:38.769
DAVID:
Make that two, and, uh,

692
00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:41.439
you know, I'm still waiting
on that breakfast burrito,

693
00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:43.340
diner girl.

694
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.575
DAVID:
Thank you.

695
00:25:44.575 --> 00:25:46.578
She is so not
getting a tip.

696
00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:50.715
Shelby, we really need
to talk... privately.

697
00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:52.116
Oh, anything
you say to me,

698
00:25:52.116 --> 00:25:55.220
you can say in
front of my peeps.

699
00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.690
Okay.

700
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.060
I want to break up.

701
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.227
What?!

702
00:26:03.227 --> 00:26:04.029
DAVID:
Ouch. Ooh.

703
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:05.297
RYAN:
That'll leave a mark.

704
00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:06.765
Are you in love
with somebody else?

705
00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:07.965
I think so.

706
00:26:07.965 --> 00:26:09.667
DAVID:
What? Who, bro?

707
00:26:09.667 --> 00:26:11.936
I don't know.

708
00:26:11.936 --> 00:26:13.103
I mean, we can still be...

709
00:26:13.103 --> 00:26:15.940
Don't say the
word "friends."

710
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.474
Now, fortunately
for you,

711
00:26:17.474 --> 00:26:20.845
I'm going to overlook this
mental breakdown of yours.

712
00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.213
Now, just chill out.

713
00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.915
We're going to go get
ready for the dance,

714
00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:26.384
and I'll see
you there, hmm?

715
00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:29.654
DAVID:
Later, late.

716
00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:30.788
Whoo...

717
00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:32.490
That went well, bro.

718
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.259
Yeah, she took it well.

719
00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.060
Good lookin' out.

720
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.562
Right.

721
00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.130
Later, diner girl.

722
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.799
Too late.

723
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:44.269
Oh, don't worry
about it.

724
00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:48.306
( sighs )

725
00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.574
You know, those kids
remind me

726
00:26:50.574 --> 00:26:54.179
of why I used to fight
in school.

727
00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:58.282
Have no fear!

728
00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:01.720
Zorro is here.

729
00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:05.490
And he's got the keys
to his dad's Mercedes.

730
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.260
You're not going to the dance
dressed as a bus girl, are you?

731
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.528
Carter, I'm not going.

732
00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:12.997
What? Wait, what do you mean,
you're not going?

733
00:27:12.997 --> 00:27:14.164
Okay, sorry, sorry, uh...

734
00:27:14.164 --> 00:27:16.200
what about... what about
Cyberdude?

735
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.502
"Cyberdude"?

736
00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:18.870
Is he talking
about the boy

737
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.237
that's been sending
you those love notes?

738
00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:23.174
Rhonda, they're not love notes.
They're e-mails.

739
00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.275
Oh, okay.

740
00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:26.578
Sam, if a man is taking
his time to write down

741
00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.746
his feelings for you,
it's a love note.

742
00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:30.714
You've got a secret admirer.

743
00:27:30.714 --> 00:27:33.450
CARTER:
And he wants to meet her

744
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.919
tonight at the dance.

745
00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:36.487
( gasps ):
What are you still doing here?

746
00:27:36.487 --> 00:27:37.856
I'm obeying orders.

747
00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.757
Sam, Sam, this is
your true love.

748
00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:41.326
Well, true love is
going to have to wait.

749
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:44.763
Oh, girl, please, save all
that drama for the soap operas.

750
00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:46.664
You are going to that dance.

751
00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:49.000
You go ahead, girlfriend.

752
00:27:49.133 --> 00:27:51.869
I can't go. If Fiona found out,
she would kill me

753
00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:54.339
and then bring me back
to clean up the mess.

754
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.440
If she wants
to hurt you,

755
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.974
she's going to have to go
through me.

756
00:27:56.974 --> 00:27:58.709
You go ahead, girlfriend,
do your thing.

757
00:27:58.709 --> 00:28:01.446
Call me "girlfriend"
one more time.

758
00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:02.480
Okay, sorry.

759
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.914
Sam, your dad

760
00:28:03.914 --> 00:28:05.950
did not leave this earth
wanting you to be unhappy.

761
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.419
It's time for you
to find your own bliss,

762
00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:10.221
starting with this dance.

763
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:11.022
Sam...

764
00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:12.423
you need to listen
to Rhonda.

765
00:28:12.423 --> 00:28:14.158
You're always studying.
You're always working.

766
00:28:14.158 --> 00:28:15.927
You need to take some time
for yourself.

767
00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:18.363
ELEANOR:
Yeah, why don't you go out

768
00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.797
and bust a move?

769
00:28:19.797 --> 00:28:20.965
Put your freak on!

770
00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:24.435
Whatever it is
you kids do these days.

771
00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:27.438
You know what?
You guys are right.

772
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.540
I never do anything for myself.

773
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.775
No, you don't.

774
00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:32.844
And I deserve to have some fun.

775
00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:32.844

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:34.245
Right, girl! Yeah!

778
00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.314
I am going to go
to that dance!

779
00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.382
Okay, great!

780
00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.216
And I am going to
meet my true love,

781
00:28:39.216 --> 00:28:40.785
and I'm going to
dance all night.

782

785
00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:51.996
I don't have a costume.

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:54.665

Yes, ma'am.

my costume

doesn't do a very good job

would you tell me who you
are if I guessed it right?

00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:12.323
Maybe.

Maybe?

1003
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.892
Well, how about we
play "20 Questions"?

1004
00:38:15.892 --> 00:38:16.894
How about ten?

1005
00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:19.563
Well, I'll take
what I can get.

1006
00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:22.900
Okay, first question:

1007
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.304
You do actually go to North
Valley High School, right?

1008
00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.438
Of course.

1009
00:38:28.438 --> 00:38:29.773
Well, I'm just checking.

1010
00:38:29.773 --> 00:38:32.275
I mean, you never know
with the Internet.

1011
00:38:32.275 --> 00:38:34.912
Okay, next question.

1012
00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:38.983
Were you disappointed
when you found out

1013
00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.517
that I was Nomad?

1014
00:38:40.517 --> 00:38:42.253
Be honest.

1015
00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:45.155
Surprisingly, no.

1016
00:38:45.522 --> 00:38:46.524
Did you vote for me

1017
00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.259
for student body president?

1018
00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.494
Surprisingly, yes.

1019
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.596
Really? Hmm.

1020
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.932
Okay, I got it.
All right, given the choice,

1021
00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:58.201
would you rather have
a rice cake or a Big Mac?

1022
00:38:58.201 --> 00:38:59.603
A Big Mac.

1023
00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.004
( laughs ):
What does that matter?

1024
00:39:01.004 --> 00:39:03.440
Well, I like a girl
with a hearty appetite.

1025
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.709
And besides, you
just eliminated

1026
00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:07.244
about 50% of the
girls in our class.

1027
00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:10.915
( laughs )

1028
00:39:13.884 --> 00:39:17.354
You think I'd
remember those eyes.

1029
00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:20.057
They're so beautiful.

1030
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:25.496
Um... next question.

1031
00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.699
What's up, doll?

1032
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.367
What are you
supposed to be?

1033
00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:31.402
A Three Musketeer.

1034
00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.437
You don't look like a candy bar.

1035
00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:38.275
Right. Look, now that
you and Austin are toast,

1036
00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:39.542
okay, why don't we

1037

little party?

Come on. Come on.

1045
00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.253

00:39:59.596 --> 00:40:00.998
Oh, yeah?

part where I run away?

1057
00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:13.944

1065
00:40:32.462 --> 00:40:33.631
Whoo! Whoo!

1066
00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:34.631
It's over, dude!

1067
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:34.631
Oh, yeah?

1068
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:36.033
Yeah.

1069
00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:37.834
Well, I hate
to tell you this, dude,

1070
00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:40.070
but I starred
in "Pirates of Penzance"

1071
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.405
three summers in a row.

1072
00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.472
Oh, yeah?

1073
00:40:42.472 --> 00:40:44.441
Say hello to Act Two,
Scene One.

1074
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:47.611

1078
00:40:56.654 --> 00:41:00.257
( owl hoots in distance )

1079
00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:00.724
Wow.

1080
00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:03.127
( chuckles )

1081
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:08.198
If I ask you to dance, does
that count as a question?

1082
00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:11.034
There's no music.

1083
00:41:11.034 --> 00:41:13.571
So?

1084
00:41:15.338 --> 00:41:18.876

1085
00:41:21.411 --> 00:41:23.881

( violin and guitar continue )

1106
00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.440
I'll let you know.

1107

( laughs softly )

1108
00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:02.045
But I've seen you before.

1109
00:43:02.045 --> 00:43:03.313
Yes.

1110
00:43:03.313 --> 00:43:08.018
Man, how could I have
seen you before...

1111
00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:10.019
and not know
who you are now?

1112
00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:13.624
Maybe you were looking,
but you weren't really seeing.

1113
00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:17.895
Hey, you've got
one more question left.

1114
00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:20.264
( quietly ):
Okay.

1115
00:43:21.264 --> 00:43:25.335
( laughing )

1116
00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.204
Do you, Princeton girl,

1117
00:43:28.204 --> 00:43:30.807
feel like you made
the right choice

1118
00:43:30.807 --> 00:43:33.210
meeting me here tonight?

1119
00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.014
I do.

1120
00:43:37.914 --> 00:43:39.816
And do you, Austin Ames,

1121
00:43:39.816 --> 00:43:43.520
ever want to see me again
after tonight?

1122
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.823
Well, I'd have to
think about that.

1123
00:43:46.823 --> 00:43:49.326
( grunts, chuckles )

1124
00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:52.162
Absolutely.

1125
00:43:57.433 --> 00:43:58.802
( song ends )

1126
00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.270
( alarm beeping )

1127
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.706
( sighs ):
Oh, not now.

1128
00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:03.707
What?

1129
00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:05.042
I've got to go.

1130
00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.343
What, do you have a
curfew or something?

1131
00:44:07.343 --> 00:44:08.612
Something like that.

1132
00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:10.046
I'm sorry.
But thank you.

1133
00:44:10.046 --> 00:44:13.116
This has been the most
amazing night. ( sighs )

1134
00:44:13.116 --> 00:44:14.918
Wait, where are you going?

1135
00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:14.918
I'm late.

1136
00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:17.387
For what?

1137
00:44:17.387 --> 00:44:19.890
Reality.

1138
00:44:26.496 --> 00:44:29.899
( dance music blares )

1139
00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:31.468
( needle scratches,
 music stops )

1140
00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:34.004
I was right in the middle
of a power jam, Mrs. Wells.

1141
00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.873
You just totally
harshed my mellow.

1142
00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.508
You'll get over it
and live.

1143
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:38.841
Hello! Yoo-hoo!

1144
00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:41.412
It is almost midnight,

1145
00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:44.047
and that means it's
time to announce

1146
00:44:44.047 --> 00:44:46.316
who we have
selected...

1147
00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.417
What's up, dawg?

1148
00:44:47.417 --> 00:44:48.952
Dave, Dave, have you seen
the girl I was with?

1149
00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:50.788
No, I haven't seen her,
but you missed it, dude,

1150
00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.823
I just beat some kid's
butt-- it was crazy.

1151
00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:56.493
MRS. WELLS:
And now, the moment you've all

1152
00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:56.493
been waiting for.

1153
00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.761
Carter?!

1154
00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:59.028
Your new North Valley High

1155
00:44:59.028 --> 00:45:00.863
Carter, Carter,
come on.

1156
00:45:00.863 --> 00:45:02.633
Homecoming prince
and princess

1157
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:02.633
are...

1158
00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.101
Come on, I'm gonna be late.

1159
00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:07.537
Prince Charming
and Cinderella!

1160
00:45:07.537 --> 00:45:08.772
It's you, bro!

1161
00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:11.374
( laughs ):
It's you!

1162
00:45:12.175 --> 00:45:14.644
My dear, I-I must
bid you adieu.

1163
00:45:14.644 --> 00:45:14.644
I'm sorry.

1164
00:45:14.644 --> 00:45:16.713
A what?

1165
00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.048
Ad-- I got to go.

1166
00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.651
I-I'm sorry. I got...

1167
00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.686
( sighs )

1168
00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:25.989
Bravo!

1169
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.091
MRS. WELLS:
Cinderella's

1170
00:45:28.091 --> 00:45:30.127
playing hard to get.

1171
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.738
( cheering and whooping )

1172
00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:48.011
( cheering continues
 in background )

1173
00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.252
( sighs )

1174
00:45:56.252 --> 00:45:58.054
I almost kissed
Austin Ames!

1175
00:45:58.054 --> 00:46:00.957
I totally, totally
kissed Shelby Cummings!

1176
00:46:00.957 --> 00:46:02.425
Wait, wait, wait,
so-so what did, uh,

1177
00:46:02.425 --> 00:46:05.629
what did he say when
he found out that you were you?

1178
00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:08.798
He didn't say, 'cause
he didn't find out.

1179
00:46:08.798 --> 00:46:12.069
You didn't tell him?
Why not?

1180
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:15.372
Carter, I live
in an attic, okay?

1181
00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:19.509
I drive a beat-up old car,
and he's expecting...

1182
00:46:19.509 --> 00:46:20.944
Malibu Barbie.

1183
00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:24.581
I'll be doing him a favor
if I just disappear.

1184
00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.582
GABRIELLA:
Shotgun!

1185
00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.650
BRIANNA:
Ow! No, I'm shotgun!

1186
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:26.650
Get in, already!

1187
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.418
Stop pulling!

1188
00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:29.752
Where are your crowns?

1189
00:46:29.752 --> 00:46:31.654
Where are your prizes?

1190
00:46:31.654 --> 00:46:33.390
Winners get prizes.

1191
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.691
We didn't win, Mom.

1192
00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:36.960
Some girl stole it from us.

1193
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.960
( groans )

1194
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.563
I am very, very, very,

1195
00:46:40.563 --> 00:46:42.999
very upset about this.

1196
00:46:42.999 --> 00:46:45.668
You don't... look upset.

1197
00:46:45.668 --> 00:46:47.471
Oh, it's the Botox.

1198
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:50.507
I can't show emotion
for another hour and a half.

1199
00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:50.507
I told you she wanted me bad.

1200
00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:54.378
Carter, just drive.

1201
00:46:56.012 --> 00:46:58.148
( tires screech )

1202
00:46:59.983 --> 00:46:59.983
Spam?!

1203
00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.050
Spam?!

1204
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:04.221
BRIANNA & GABRIELLA:
Mom!

1205
00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.222
It's Sam!

1206
00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.023
BRIANNA & GABRIELLA:
Over there!

1207
00:47:07.023 --> 00:47:09.760
( chuckles ):
Hi! Uh....

1208
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.595
Mrs. Montgomery.

1209
00:47:14.564 --> 00:47:17.768
Mom, she was there!
She's in the car!

1210
00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:19.636
We saw her, Mom!

1211
00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:21.237
That's ridiculous.

1212
00:47:21.237 --> 00:47:22.772
She's working tonight.

1213
00:47:22.772 --> 00:47:25.508
She would never
disobey me.

1214
00:47:25.508 --> 00:47:26.476
She was there!

1215
00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:27.277
She was with that boy!

1216
00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:27.277
In the car!

1217
00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:28.378
I saw her, too!

1218
00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.614
FIONA:
Shut your cat face!

1219
00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:32.716
Did they see me?

1220
00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:34.451
No, I don't

1221
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:39.589
think so, but the wannabe
Olsen twins might have.

1222
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:42.292
( horn honking )

1223
00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.361
( honking continues )

1224
00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.663
Carter, I know you want
to take care of this car,

1225
00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:48.198
but, please, can you step on it?

1226
00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:49.599
In case you
haven't noticed,

1227
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:52.702
I'm already going 38
in a 35-mile zone, Sam,

1228
00:47:52.702 --> 00:47:54.938
so can you just
lay off, please?

1229
00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:58.140
GABRIELLA:
Come on, catch up to them!

1230
00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.342
Mother, will you speed up?

1231
00:47:59.342 --> 00:48:01.912
We've got to beat Sam
back to the diner!

1232
00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:03.213
Shut up, girls.

1233
00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:05.048
We'll be back at the diner
soon enough.

1234
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.083
GABRIELLA:
Soon enough isn't soon enough!

1235
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:07.083
( tires screeching )

1236
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:09.086
What are you doing?!

1237
00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.720
Take your paw
off the gas!

1238
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.688
I can't! It's stuck!

1239
00:48:12.688 --> 00:48:13.890
( screaming )

1240
00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.059
( screaming continues )

1241
00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:20.464
( horns honking,
 tires screeching )

1242
00:48:25.835 --> 00:48:27.904
SAM:
Go, go!

1243
00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:29.672
Carter, you could have

1244
00:48:29.672 --> 00:48:31.474
totally made that light.

1245
00:48:31.474 --> 00:48:32.742
Uh, FYI, Sam,

1246
00:48:32.742 --> 00:48:36.246
yellow means "slow down,"
okay, not "speed up."

1247
00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:38.114
I need
 The Fast and the Furious,

1248
00:48:38.114 --> 00:48:39.249
not Driving Miss Daisy.

1249
00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:41.218
( tires screeching nearby )

1250
00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:43.953
( Fiona, Gabriella and Brianna
 screaming )

1251
00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:47.957
BRIANNA:
We're gonna die...!

1252
00:48:47.957 --> 00:48:49.692
Was that...?

1253
00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:50.961
Uh-huh.

1254
00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:54.131
( screaming continues )

1255
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.168
Stop! Stop!

1256
00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:00.837
( horns beeping and honking )

1257
00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:03.040
( screaming continues )

1258
00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:10.981
( tires screeching )

1259
00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.882
( gasping and panting )

1260
00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:14.050
Uh-oh.

1261
00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.086
I think I need to use
the litter box.

1262
00:49:17.086 --> 00:49:18.155
GABRIELLA:
Ew...

1263
00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.156
Oh, my God.

1264
00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.790
My face is back.

1265
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:24.361
( R&B music playing
 in background )

1266
00:49:25.995 --> 00:49:28.631
Ha! I told you
she wasn't here!

1267
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:29.766
Uh-huh, nope, nope.

1268
00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:30.800
Where is Sam?

1269
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.134
What do you mean,
where's Sam?

1270
00:49:32.134 --> 00:49:33.303
Where do you think she is?

1271
00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:34.404
She better be here.

1272
00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.172
Uh, Fiona, I was gonna
talk to you

1273
00:49:36.172 --> 00:49:38.475
about something
that I really...

1274
00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:39.643
Fiona, wait!

1275
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.844
Oh. Um...

1276
00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:42.345
I want to get
my breasts done.

1277
00:49:42.345 --> 00:49:43.980
Where did you get those?

1278
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.115
San Diego.

1279
00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.483
Excuse me.

1280
00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:48.318
Did-did you notice how
shiny the floors are

1281
00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:49.786
since we switched
to Mr. Clean?

1282
00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:52.322
( chuckles ):
What are you, a commercial?

1283
00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.024
FIONA:
Click.

1284
00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.291
Ooh, Mommy, oh!

1285
00:49:55.291 --> 00:49:57.427
Fiona, I'm so glad
you're here,

1286
00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.929
because, uh,
wuh... the fish!

1287
00:49:59.929 --> 00:50:01.631
Nemo is no mo'.

1288
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.865
Smell.

1289
00:50:02.865 --> 00:50:04.401
You know, Fiona, there's
a tear in one of the booths...

1290
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.569
Right!
And we were gonna tell you...

1291
00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:07.070
( others talking at once )

1292
00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.938
What am I supposed to do
with a dead fish?

1293
00:50:08.938 --> 00:50:11.975
Everyone shut up!

1294
00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:15.344
When I find her,
I'm gonna wring her...

1295
00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:15.344
( bell dings )

1296
00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:18.514
Orders up.

1297
00:50:18.514 --> 00:50:22.151
Sam... what are you
doing back there?

1298
00:50:22.151 --> 00:50:25.021
Um, just working
on my cooking skills.

1299
00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:26.857
Yeah, I was teaching her

1300
00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.491
to make pancakes
with salmon.

1301
00:50:28.491 --> 00:50:30.793
How was the dance, girls?

1302
00:50:31.761 --> 00:50:35.365
You know, something
stinks around here...

1303
00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:38.201
and it's not the fish.

1304
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.205
You're gonna get it.

1305
00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.574
Come on, girls.

1306
00:50:48.878 --> 00:50:51.281
( groans )

1307
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.718
We made it.

1308
00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:57.853
And not a scratch.

1309
00:50:57.853 --> 00:51:00.557
( squeaking )

1310
00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:02.859
Ow! You bit me!

1311
00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:05.028
Girls, come on.

1312
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.062
You dummy!

1313
00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:09.266
The car smells
like bad cheese.

1314
00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.006
Don't get your dirty paws
all over me.

1315
00:51:17.173 --> 00:51:19.409
( tires screech, girls gasp )

1316
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:20.410
( clank )

1317
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.647
( two short gasps )

1318
00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:26.216
What is he doing here?

1319
00:51:29.151 --> 00:51:31.554
( soft gasp )

1320
00:51:31.554 --> 00:51:34.858
Tonight must be my lucky night.
Okay.

1321
00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:36.960
( metal screeches )

1322
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.597
( creaking and squeaking )

1323
00:51:41.597 --> 00:51:42.398
Oh!

1324
00:51:42.398 --> 00:51:43.533
( screaming )

1325
00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:47.504
( crackling, glass shattering )

1326
00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:48.972
( crackling and popping )

1327
00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:51.440
( screaming continues )

1328
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.911
( whimpering )

1329
00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:57.714
Mrs. Montgomery...

1330
00:51:58.914 --> 00:52:00.250
...your sign hit my...

1331
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.484
( zapping, crackling )

1332
00:52:01.484 --> 00:52:02.886
( softly ):
...car.

1333
00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:04.621
( thud )

1334
00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.823
ASTRID ( over p.a. ):
 Gozai imas, Fighting Frogs.

1335
00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:09.358
Here's your daily
drought reminder:

1336
00:52:09.358 --> 00:52:11.327
Only flush for number two.

1337
00:52:11.327 --> 00:52:12.963
Austin Ames was crowned

1338
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:15.331
Prince of the Homecoming Dance.

1339
00:52:15.331 --> 00:52:17.100
Whoo, big shocker there.

1340
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.701
Didn't see that one coming.

1341
00:52:18.701 --> 00:52:22.872
But the real mystery, though,
is, who was his princess?

1342
00:52:22.872 --> 00:52:24.607
SAM:
How long are you grounded for?

1343
00:52:24.607 --> 00:52:26.476
CARTER:
Well, how long is forever?

1344
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.977
So, you're not gonna
tell Austin?

1345
00:52:27.977 --> 00:52:31.481
Come on, Carter, it's not like
he's gonna be pining for me.

1346
00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:35.218
Trust me, he's forgotten
all about Cinderella by now.

1347
00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:37.621
( gasps softly )

1348
00:52:44.827 --> 00:52:46.629
Oh.

1349
00:52:46.629 --> 00:52:48.364
CARTER:
Yeah, he's obviously

1350
00:52:48.364 --> 00:52:50.567
forgotten all about you.

1351
00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:54.136
( chuckles )

1352
00:52:54.303 --> 00:52:55.671
DAVID:
Dude, why are you going

1353
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:57.640
through all this trouble
for one chick?

1354
00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.644
Look, she's not just
some chick, all right?

1355
00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:01.978
She was... real.

1356
00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:05.582
Real. Like,
she still had her old nose.

1357
00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.850
No, real.

1358
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.618
You know, like the kind of girl
who has more on her mind

1359
00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:11.288
than what she wears, or how much
weight she wants to lose.

1360
00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.522
She listens to me, you know?

1361
00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.423
Oh, listens to you?
Hey, brother,

1362
00:53:14.423 --> 00:53:15.992
I listen to you, okay?

1363
00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:18.060
I feel your pai... Whoo.

1364
00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.063
DAVID:
Hello, kitty.

1365
00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:22.531
Yeah. You're
a great listener.

1366
00:53:22.531 --> 00:53:24.167
RYAN:
Look, man, you found

1367
00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:27.236
her cell phone-- you just got
to get some clue from that.

1368
00:53:27.236 --> 00:53:28.471
The phone's locked.

1369
00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.672
All I keep getting
is these text messages,

1370
00:53:29.672 --> 00:53:31.841
like "I need you"
and "Come see me now."

1371
00:53:31.841 --> 00:53:33.944
Oh, dude, it's so hot!

1372
00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.345
See, that's
what I thought.

1373
00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:38.982
Until I got one that said,
"Come fix fryer."

1374
00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.083
Oh, dude!

1375
00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.417
That's hot and
kinky, baby!

1376
00:53:41.417 --> 00:53:43.219
You know what I'm saying?
Can I get one?

1377
00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.187
Let me get a pound, baby.

1378
00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.690
Sam, he's looking
for you everywhere.

1379
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.392
You got to tell
him it was you.

1380
00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.560
Isn't it better
just to cling

1381
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.228
to the dream
of what might have been

1382
00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.963
instead of ruining
everything with reality?

1383
00:53:53.963 --> 00:53:56.666
Well, I mean, you can't
hide from him forever.

1384
00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:58.434
Not forever--
just until graduation,

1385
00:53:58.434 --> 00:54:01.304
when I leave this place
and never see him again.

1386
00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:04.240
Okay, so what about you,
Zorro?

1387
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.774
When are you gonna
tell Shelby?

1388
00:54:05.774 --> 00:54:08.144
Well, I... I've been thinking
about doing just that,

1389
00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:09.846
as a matter of fact.

1390
00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:10.813
Right. Okay,

1391
00:54:10.813 --> 00:54:12.448
so the day you tell Shelby
it was you,

1392
00:54:12.448 --> 00:54:15.285
I'll tell Austin it was me.

1393
00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:16.286
Deal.

1394
00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.453
Deal.

1395
00:54:17.453 --> 00:54:18.988
Well, look in the
yearbook again, bro.

1396
00:54:18.988 --> 00:54:20.156
Maybe you missed her.

1397
00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:21.423
Maybe she's
foreign exchange.

1398
00:54:21.423 --> 00:54:22.725
That's hot. Totally.

1399
00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:25.728
That's like...
that's like Le Hot.

1400
00:54:25.728 --> 00:54:28.031
Look, there's no way
I missed her.

1401
00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:31.968
I mean, we had a connection.

1402
00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:37.907
Oh!

1403
00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:39.008
Thanks.

1404
00:54:39.008 --> 00:54:41.076
Geez, are you okay?

1405
00:54:41.076 --> 00:54:42.679
Ow!

1406
00:54:50.219 --> 00:54:52.421
GABRIELLA:
Keep your legs straight.

1407
00:54:52.421 --> 00:54:53.956
Straighter, straighter.

1408
00:54:53.956 --> 00:54:56.659
What are you doing?!

1409
00:54:56.659 --> 00:54:57.860
Brianna!

1410
00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.629
After the flip, it's
the Butterfly Rollover!

1411
00:54:59.629 --> 00:54:59.629
No, it's not!
It's the Mermaid Plunge!

1412
00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:02.499
Yes!

1413
00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.733
Oh, my God.

1414
00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:06.102
I cannot wait for
my solo career!

1415
00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:08.604
When are we going solo?

1416
00:55:08.604 --> 00:55:10.640
He was so mysterious.

1417
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.575
But really obvious
at the same time.

1418
00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:16.112
I mean, kind of dangerous,
but very safe.

1419
00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:18.981
And wild, but... but tame.

1420
00:55:18.981 --> 00:55:20.182
( chuckling )

1421
00:55:20.182 --> 00:55:22.117
GIRL:
I'm gonna go change!

1422
00:55:22.117 --> 00:55:25.688
I cannot believe you're gonna
tell Shelby it was you.

1423
00:55:25.688 --> 00:55:27.190
Sam, once she realizes that

1424
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:31.260
she's found her Zorro,
okay, she'll be thrilled.

1425
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.396
Now, watch and learn.

1426
00:55:34.396 --> 00:55:35.798
Good luck.

1427
00:55:35.798 --> 00:55:38.501
And, oh, my God,
when I kissed him...

1428
00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:40.203
Enough already.

1429
00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:42.539
Madison, I think
somebody's got

1430
00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:46.376
a green monster on their back
called Mr. Jealousy.

1431
00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:47.577
Shelby...

1432
00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:50.413
baby, what's up?

1433
00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.747
And you are...?

1434
00:55:51.747 --> 00:55:53.650
( chuckling )

1435
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.252
Yeah. Allow me...

1436
00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:59.956
to refresh your memory.

1437
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.324
Zorro.

1438
00:56:02.324 --> 00:56:05.028
Ugh! You mean, Zero!

1439
00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.429
Who is he?

1440
00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.697
That's Carter Farrell.

1441
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.899
He's the guy you
cheat off of in Algebra Two.

1442
00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:13.536
The freak who hums
show tunes?

1443
00:56:13.836 --> 00:56:16.373
( nervous laugh )

1444
00:56:18.107 --> 00:56:19.308
Mmm.

1445
00:56:19.308 --> 00:56:20.243
I'm in front!

1446
00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:20.243
Quit it!

1447
00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:21.678
Sorry!

1448
00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:25.948
Listen, last night
I had a very bad cold,

1449
00:56:25.948 --> 00:56:28.751
and I drank
a whole bottle of Nyquil.

1450
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:30.653
I-I just wasn't myself.

1451
00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:32.288
But... I thought we had,

1452
00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:35.024
like, a... a connection.

1453
00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.525
Okay.

1454
00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:38.228
We don't have anything.

1455
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:42.331
We are from completely
different classes of human.

1456
00:56:42.331 --> 00:56:43.733
Now, let's just go back

1457
00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.868
to our usual lives,
where we only mingle

1458
00:56:45.868 --> 00:56:49.138
when I copy you
in Algebra Two, 'kay?

1459
00:56:49.138 --> 00:56:50.873
( Brianna and Gabriella
 arguing )

1460
00:56:50.873 --> 00:56:52.475
( mocking ):
'Kay?

1461
00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:55.344
( both screaming )

1462
00:56:55.344 --> 00:56:58.347
( laughter )

1463
00:56:58.347 --> 00:57:01.084
BRIANNA:
Was that good?

1464
00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:05.621
( shoes sloshing )

1465
00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:07.223
You all right?

1466
00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:10.393
If she thinks she's still
cheating off me, she's crazy.

1467
00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:12.628
AUSTIN:
 Guys, I don't know about this.

1468
00:57:12.628 --> 00:57:14.497
DAVID:
 Come on!

1469
00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:15.698
Just trust us.

1470
00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:16.832
Look, we asked every girl
we could find

1471
00:57:16.832 --> 00:57:18.367
if they were with you
at the dance.

1472
00:57:18.367 --> 00:57:18.367
( screaming )

1473
00:57:18.367 --> 00:57:20.603
Here's the ones that said yes.

1474
00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:22.071
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1475
00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:24.273
Austin, remember, it was me
on the cell phone?!

1476
00:57:24.273 --> 00:57:25.508
( squealing )

1477
00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.109
Guys, come on.

1478
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:28.077
Down here.

1479
00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.146
( "Dating Game" theme plays )

1480
00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:31.714
Okay! Austin Ames,

1481
00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:34.583
let's bring out
Bachelorette Number One.

1482
00:57:34.583 --> 00:57:37.453
She's a transfer
from Woodland Hills,

1483
00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:41.257
enjoys collecting puka shells,
long walks on the beach

1484
00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.892
and getting tubed.

1485
00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.694
Pleased to me you, Missy.

1486
00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.362
What's up, Boston?

1487
00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.531
Thanks for coming, Missy.

1488
00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.033
See ya, dude.

1489
00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.001
You're dead.

1490
00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.102
Okay!

1491
00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:57.407
Okay, let's bring out
Bachelorette Number Two.

1492
00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.275
This little filly's
into barbells,

1493
00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:02.545
World War II and protein shakes.

1494
00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.914
Here's Helga.

1495
00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:07.016
Thank you.

1496
00:58:07.016 --> 00:58:08.284
DAVID:
Thank you.

1497
00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:10.019
You are so dead.

1498
00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.320
Okay, okay,

1499
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.821
next up is, uh, is...

1500
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:14.457
Look, enough, enough.

1501
00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.825
Guys, come on.

1502
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:16.859
( music stops )

1503
00:58:16.859 --> 00:58:19.161
Look, you're beautiful, okay.

1504
00:58:19.161 --> 00:58:21.096
But I'm not your prince.

1505
00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:24.033
You'll meet him someday,
but it's not me.

1506
00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:26.069
Thanks, Austin.

1507
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:27.036
Uh-oh,

1508
00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:27.803
late entry.

1509
00:58:27.803 --> 00:58:29.439
David, you stop it right now.

1510
00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.840
You're a bad boy.

1511
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.342
And that is a terrible shirt.

1512
00:58:33.342 --> 00:58:36.211
Everybody, back to your class.

1513
00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:37.914
Hi, Ryan.

1514
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.522
( singsongy ):
Don't want that.

1515
00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:47.856
Don't want that.

1516
00:58:47.856 --> 00:58:52.027
Don't want that,
don't want that.

1517
00:58:52.027 --> 00:58:54.731
Oh-ho...

1518
00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:04.407
( gasps ):
Accepted?

1519
00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:08.278
Oh, this won't do.

1520
00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:12.248
Hey. Anything in
the mail for me?

1521
00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:15.984
Oh, uh, actually, there's
a personalized letter here

1522
00:59:15.984 --> 00:59:20.456
from Ed McMahon saying you
just won a million dollars.

1523
00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.024
( chuckles )

1524
00:59:22.024 --> 00:59:24.994
Don't spend it all
in one place.

1525
00:59:26.428 --> 00:59:29.699
( chuckling )

1526
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.569
Oh...

1527
00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:37.640
AUSTIN:
 I need to know who you are.

1528
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.008
 I can't take my mind off you.

1529
00:59:40.008 --> 00:59:43.646
 Please tell me who you are.

1530
00:59:47.983 --> 00:59:50.587
( sighs ):
Okay.

1531
00:59:52.154 --> 00:59:54.556
My name is...

1532
00:59:54.556 --> 00:59:55.791
Sam!

1533
00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:57.060
( sighs )

1534
00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.861
I guess you missed the
"Do not disturb" sign.

1535
00:59:58.861 --> 00:59:59.895
No, I saw it.

1536
00:59:59.895 --> 01:00:01.097
( chuckles )

1537
01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.799
So, you almost done
with my report?

1538
01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.200
It's due Friday.

1539
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.635
I'm working on it.

1540
01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:06.669
Well, hurry up.

1541
01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.237
It makes me nervous

1542
01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.072
to have to wait for it.

1543
01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.473
Imagine how nervous you'd be

1544
01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.874
if you actually had to write it.

1545
01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:15.311
Oh... my God, you're right.

1546
01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.812
So, this time,

1547
01:00:16.812 --> 01:00:19.715
could you try to make
it sound more like me?

1548
01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:20.783
I mean, I'm so sick

1549
01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.151
of having to explain
why I sound

1550
01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:25.688
so smart on paper
and so not smart...

1551
01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.289
not on paper.

1552
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:29.992
FIONA ( over speaker ):
Sam? Can you come downstairs?

1553
01:00:29.992 --> 01:00:31.627
I'll be right there.

1554
01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.162
Now!

1555
01:00:36.465 --> 01:00:39.168
I'll be right back.

1556
01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:42.271
Hurry up.

1557
01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.639
( sighs )

1558
01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:46.776
( sucks teeth, clicks tongue )

1559
01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.047
Hm-hm!

1560
01:00:55.017 --> 01:00:55.717
Huh.

1561
01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:59.222
Who the heck is Nomad?

1562
01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:04.026
( sighs ):
"Cinderella,

1563
01:01:04.026 --> 01:01:05.460
"are you not talking to me

1564
01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.365
"'cause you freaked
when you found out I'm...

1565
01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:13.502
Austin Ames"?!

1566
01:01:13.502 --> 01:01:16.272
Sam is Cinderella?

1567
01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.143
Oh...

1568
01:01:23.078 --> 01:01:24.546
Wow.

1569
01:01:24.546 --> 01:01:26.715
I got in.

1570
01:01:26.715 --> 01:01:28.084
Austin!

1571
01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.285
Austin.

1572
01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:31.087
What?

1573
01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:33.756
What's going on?

1574
01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:37.026
Nothing.

1575
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.495
Let me guess.

1576
01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.662
You're thinking,

1577
01:01:40.662 --> 01:01:42.365
is USC really the
right choice for me?

1578
01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.466
Well, yeah.

1579
01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.901
I've been thinking a lot
about this, and...

1580
01:01:45.901 --> 01:01:47.637
Don't worry about it.

1581
01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:50.139
You're making the right choice.

1582
01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.941
All right?

1583
01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:57.113
Okay...

1584
01:01:57.113 --> 01:02:00.816
It's me, Austin.
It's... Cinderella.

1585
01:02:00.816 --> 01:02:02.318
From the dance.

1586
01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.420
Oh! You found me!

1587
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.155
( chuckles )

1588
01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.823
Oh, no.

1589
01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:11.427
"You see, Austin,
I live in this world..."

1590
01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:16.699
"...full of people pretending
to be something they're not."

1591
01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:17.766
"Pretending..."

1592
01:02:17.766 --> 01:02:20.636
"I miss you.
I don't want..."

1593
01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:23.172
AUSTIN:
I got it.

1594
01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:24.606
How you doing?

1595
01:02:24.606 --> 01:02:26.575
Good.

1596
01:02:26.575 --> 01:02:29.345
( sighs deeply )

1597
01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:31.814
Regular wash?

1598
01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:34.517
No. More like
the royal treatment.

1599
01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:38.687
I mean, that's what
Cinderella would want.

1600
01:02:38.687 --> 01:02:40.556
What did you just say?

1601
01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:41.691
I'm her, Austin.

1602
01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:44.059
I'm Cinderella, your dream girl.

1603
01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:47.562
You see, I live
in a world full of...

1604
01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:48.430
You!

1605
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.100
What are you doing here?

1606
01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.100
( sighs )

1607
01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.603
Well, I'm Cinderella.

1608
01:02:54.603 --> 01:02:56.172
Coming to meet my prince.

1609
01:02:56.172 --> 01:03:00.242
Well, that's a little hard
considering I'm Cinderella.

1610
01:03:00.242 --> 01:03:02.044
I mean, I'm the
most Cinderella-y

1611
01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:04.180
Cinderella
there ever was!

1612
01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.214
Mm-mm!

1613
01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:06.381
Okay, ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies.

1614
01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:07.816
Look, I can settle this,
all right?

1615
01:03:07.816 --> 01:03:09.218
The girl that I met
at the dance,

1616
01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:11.854
she dropped something
on her way out.

1617
01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.589
What was it?

1618
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.925
Oh, that's easy.

1619
01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.459
A wallet.

1620
01:03:17.459 --> 01:03:18.427
No.

1621
01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:22.732
Uh, I-I... I meant
a... a wallet-purse.

1622
01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:22.732
No.

1623
01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.833
Oh!

1624
01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.869
A fish!

1625
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.971
A fish.

1626
01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.405
It was the first thing
that popped into my head

1627
01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:33.642
and you said "wallet-purse"!
What is that?

1628
01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:34.877
Austin?!

1629
01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.546
Wow.

1630
01:03:38.113 --> 01:03:39.649
Look what you did!
See?

1631
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.983
You always ruin
everything!

1632
01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.352
I was supposed to be Cinderella.
I'm the oldest!

1633
01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.955
Oh! By a minute
and 26 seconds!

1634
01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:49.158
And you never
let me forget it!

1635
01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.894
( grunts )

1636
01:03:53.295 --> 01:03:56.499
Well, maybe this
will help you remember.

1637
01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.166
( yells )

1638
01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.668
Come here! Brianna!

1639
01:03:58.668 --> 01:03:58.668
( screaming )

1640
01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.869
You're dead!

1641
01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:04.173
I'm gonna kill you!

1642
01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:09.678
Bri?

1643
01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:11.848
Oh! No...!

1644
01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:16.351
I'm gonna kill you!

1645
01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:17.019
Get off!

1646
01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.420
( loud squeak )

1647
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.922
That's for
stealing my idea!

1648
01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:22.658
Hey, Dad, isn't
that our car?

1649
01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.192
( giggles )

1650
01:04:24.192 --> 01:04:24.192
I hate you!

1651
01:04:24.192 --> 01:04:26.896
I hate you!

1652
01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.400
( girls screaming )

1653
01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:37.740
( buzzer sounding )

1654
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.609
Oh, no!

1655
01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.576
Not the...

1656
01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.844
BOTH:
...hot wax!

1657
01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:46.014
( distant screams,
 buzzer sounding )

1658
01:04:46.014 --> 01:04:50.052
( screams and buzzer stop )

1659
01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:07.436
( bell dings )

1660
01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:13.275
( door opens )

1661
01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:17.980
( slow romantic ballad
 playing on jukebox )

1662
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.883
Bobby, can I get
two BLTs?

1663
01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.919
BOBBY:
It's coming.

1664
01:05:25.654 --> 01:05:28.524
( no audio )

1665
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:32.061
( clears throat )

1666
01:05:42.237 --> 01:05:44.239
Hey.

1667
01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:47.343
Can I get you something?

1668
01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.512
Do you know
what bugs me?

1669
01:05:51.012 --> 01:05:52.781
People taking your order?

1670
01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:56.118
No. Taking
people's orders.

1671
01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.220
Why would you do that?

1672
01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.624
Hah. You don't
know my dad.

1673
01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.626
Ugh. Sushi and donuts?

1674
01:06:04.626 --> 01:06:06.595
Who does that?

1675
01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.898
I'll take a coffee.
Thank you.

1676
01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:12.068
MAN:
Uh, excuse me, miss?

1677
01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.071
Do you ever feel like

1678
01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:17.706
if you show someone
who you really are,

1679
01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:20.776
they won't accept you?

1680
01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:23.445
Yeah. I do.

1681
01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:27.750
Like... being yourself
isn't good enough.

1682
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.185
Right.

1683
01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.453
Like you're wearing a mask.

1684
01:06:31.453 --> 01:06:35.291
That's exactly how I feel.

1685
01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:38.760
You just want to be honest
with this person

1686
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.196
and tell them, "It's me.

1687
01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.965
I'm the one that you've been
looking for."

1688
01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:45.066
Yeah.

1689
01:06:45.066 --> 01:06:48.237
Austin...

1690
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:48.971
I'm...

1691
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:52.841
Sam!

1692
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.576
One second.

1693
01:06:54.576 --> 01:06:55.344
No, now.

1694
01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.478
( sighs )

1695
01:06:56.478 --> 01:06:59.715
No, it's cool.
I gotta bounce.

1696
01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:07.790
Oh.

1697
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.194
Thank you... very much, Sam.

1698
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:15.697
You're welcome.

1699
01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:17.166
ASTRID ( over p.a. ):
 Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.

1700
01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.700
Here's your daily
drought reminder:

1701
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.036
Don't hose your lawn,
your car...

1702
01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.570
or anybody else,
for that matter.

1703
01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:25.674
And remember, tickets for
the big game go on sale...

1704
01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:29.845
GABRIELLA:
And then she told us that...

1705
01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.346
( sniffs )

1706
01:07:31.346 --> 01:07:32.748
she was going to try
to steal Austin away from you

1707
01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.683
if that was
the last thing she did.

1708
01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:39.354
Our stepsister has always
been jealous of you.

1709
01:07:39.354 --> 01:07:41.590
( blows nose loudly )

1710
01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.126
Go on.

1711
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.262
Well, that's when
she invented this whole...

1712
01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.696
Cinderella plot.

1713
01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.365
She got ahold of Austin's
e-mail address and,

1714
01:07:50.365 --> 01:07:53.268
and that's when she started
the whole affair.

1715
01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:55.403
And we wanted to
tell you sooner,

1716
01:07:55.403 --> 01:07:57.972
but she threatened
to kill us.

1717
01:07:57.972 --> 01:08:00.276
She's such a monster.

1718
01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:04.079
Look, if you
don't believe us,

1719
01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.313
look at the e-mails.

1720
01:08:05.313 --> 01:08:08.150
She goes by
"Princeton Girl 818,"

1721
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.418
but her real name
is Sam Montgomery.

1722
01:08:10.418 --> 01:08:13.489
And we're Brianna
and Gabriella.

1723
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:17.693
So that...
little boyfriend stealer

1724
01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:21.162
thinks she can pull
a fast one on me?

1725
01:08:21.162 --> 01:08:25.100
Well, we'll just see about that.

1726
01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.274
Austin was really late today

1727
01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:36.377
and asked me if you'd
read this announcement.

1728
01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:38.846
( mike feedback squeals )

1729
01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:41.849
"Cinderella..

1730
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.419
"if you're listening,

1731
01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:47.256
your prince wants to rendezvous
with you after the pep rally."

1732
01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:51.694
Nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince.

1733
01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:56.632
( bell rings )

1734
01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:03.338
Carter!

1735
01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.272
I talked to him.

1736
01:09:04.272 --> 01:09:05.407
And not as Cinderella.

1737
01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:06.941
I talked to him
as me, Sam,

1738
01:09:06.941 --> 01:09:08.542
and he didn't hate me.

1739
01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:11.245
Do it-- so, so you
told him everything?

1740
01:09:11.246 --> 01:09:12.413
No, not everything.

1741
01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:13.947
Not the part about
me being Cinderella.

1742
01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:16.518
But I'm gonna go tell him
right after the pep rally.

1743
01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:17.952
You coming, cowboy?

1744
01:09:17.952 --> 01:09:21.557
What, so you think I look
like a real cowboy in this?

1745
01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:22.491
Sure.

1746
01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:26.162
( crowd cheering, band playing )

1747
01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:38.506
( band playing, crowd cheering )

1748
01:09:45.313 --> 01:09:48.184
( band playing )

1749
01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.287
Who we gonna beat?

1750
01:09:53.287 --> 01:09:54.657
CROWD:
The Lancers!

1751
01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.425
And when we gonna beat 'em?

1752
01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.392
CROWD:
Friday!

1753
01:09:57.392 --> 01:09:58.727
Good news, buddy.

1754
01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.095
I just got off the
phone with Hank Cole.

1755
01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.262
You play well on Friday

1756
01:10:01.262 --> 01:10:03.665
and your future is
set at USC football.

1757
01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:03.665
Who's gonna get it done?

1758
01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:06.535
That's great, Dad.

1759
01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.736
CROWD:
The Frogs!

1760
01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.872
And who's gonna
lead us to victory?!

1761
01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:11.740
CROWD:
Austin!

1762
01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.442
COACH:
I can't hear you!

1763
01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:16.144
Kill the Lancers!

1764
01:10:16.144 --> 01:10:18.046
( cheering )

1765
01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.284
The, uh, cheerleaders have
put together a little skit

1766
01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.986
to help get us in the spirit.

1767
01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.555
( cheering, applause )

1768
01:10:28.923 --> 01:10:30.325
Thank you.

1769
01:10:30.325 --> 01:10:35.697
"Once upon a time, there was
a big, strong Fighting Frog.

1770
01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:37.565
"He had a beautiful girlfriend

1771
01:10:37.565 --> 01:10:41.303
and his dad owned the biggest
pond in all the land."

( laughter )

1773
01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.673
"But he still wasn't happy."

1774
01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.708
Aw...!

1775
01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:48.610
"If only he could find
a princess,

1776
01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:51.579
"then she could kiss him,
turn him into a prince

1777
01:10:51.579 --> 01:10:53.315
and they would run away
together."

1778

had a secret identity,

This isn't good.

Dear Princeton Girl,

1793
01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.581
I can't wait until till
we finally get to meet.

1794
01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:28.483
You're the only one
who understands the real me.

1795
01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:30.919
The me who doesn't
want to play USC football,

1796
01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:34.756
but who wants to be
at Princeton, with you.

1797
01:11:34.756 --> 01:11:37.926
What are they
talking about?

1798
01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:38.961
Nothing.

1799
01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.195
Dear Nomad,

1800
01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:43.565
I want you to know who
I am but... I'm scared!

1801
01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:47.269
I'm scared that
you'll reject me.

1802
01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:48.503
And...

1803
01:11:48.503 --> 01:11:51.674
I've never had
a real kiss before.

1804
01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:52.941
Aw...!

1805
01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:54.976
I can't believe that
they're reading my e-mails.

1806
01:11:54.976 --> 01:11:56.045
Sam, let's go.

1807
01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.713
"But our princess
had a secret, too.

1808
01:11:57.713 --> 01:12:01.917
"She wasn't royalty at all,
but a geek, a loser,

1809
01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.986
a servant girl."

1810
01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:08.257
( squeals )

1811
01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.425
( jeers, laughter )

1812
01:12:10.425 --> 01:12:13.161
Any ideas about this?

1813
01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:14.496
( chuckles )

1814
01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.533
And who, may you ask,
is this impostor?

1815
01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.235
Give it up for
the pretend princess,

1816
01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:24.873
diner girl, Sam Montgomery!

1817
01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:31.112
CROWD ( chanting ):
Diner girl!

1818
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:33.415

1819
01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.950

Diner girl! Diner girl!

1822
01:12:41.756 --> 01:12:42.891
Come on.

FIONA:
Sam!

1828
01:13:06.748 --> 01:13:08.884
( crying ):
Go away!

1829
01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:13.856
But, Sam, you've got
a letter from Princeton.

1830
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:23.465
What does it say?

1831
01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.239
I didn't get in.

1832
01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:32.807
( gasps )

1833
01:13:32.807 --> 01:13:36.278
Oh, no!

1834
01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:38.179
Oh, and you studied
so hard.

1835
01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:42.083
I can't believe that I actually
thought I had a chance.

1836
01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:43.285
Oh, Sam,

1837
01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.319
I'm heartbroken.

1838
01:13:45.319 --> 01:13:49.324
Oh, life can be so unfair.

1839
01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:50.992
Well, just look at
the bright side.

1840
01:13:50.992 --> 01:13:55.831
You have a job at the diner
for the rest of your life.

1841
01:13:58.066 --> 01:14:00.803
You want a cookie?

1842
01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:07.609
Mm, they're so moist.

1843
01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.921

Come on, sweetie,

What I meant is, what are
you doing with your life?

1868

I'm Diner Girl.

1869

You don't even realize

We have faith in you.

1874

What?!

1878
01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.419
Oh, yes, you did.

1879
01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.288
Well, that's gonna come out

1880
01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.389
of your paycheck.

1881
01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.057

of striking out

1884
01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:18.132
keep you from playing the game."

1885
01:17:18.132 --> 01:17:19.167
All right.

1886
01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:21.703
Well, I'm going off
to get some more lipo.

1887
01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:22.971
Come on, girls.

1888
01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:26.040
Sam, we need you to clean
the pool tonight.

1889
01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.876
No.

01:17:31.579 --> 01:17:33.281

1891
01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.716
Excuse me?

1892
01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.718
You heard me.

1893
01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:38.220
I quit.

1894
01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.454
I quit this job,

1895
01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.222
I quit your family,

1896
01:17:41.222 --> 01:17:42.757
and I'm moving out.

1897
01:17:42.757 --> 01:17:43.858
( Fiona gasps )

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:50.565
Oh, and, uh,
where you gonna live?

1901
01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.668
With me.

1902
01:17:54.402 --> 01:17:55.836
You can't just walk out on me.

1903
01:17:55.836 --> 01:17:56.871
( chuckles )

1904
01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:58.473
You know what, Fiona?

1905
01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.876
You can mess with your hair
and your nose and your face,

1906
01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:03.611
and you can even mess
with my dad's diner,

1907
01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:06.214
but you're through
messing with me.

1908
01:18:07.882 --> 01:18:08.849
Wait up, Sam.

1909
01:18:08.849 --> 01:18:10.852
You take one more step

1910
01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:12.554
and you're fired.

1911
01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:15.924
Oh, no, that won't be necessary
because I quit, too.

1912
01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.192
And you know what?

1913
01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.693
The only reason why
I stayed around

1914
01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:21.629
and put up with you for all
these years is because

1915
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:22.797
of that girl--

1916
01:18:22.797 --> 01:18:24.266
and now that
she's free of you,

1917
01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:27.235
there is nothing stopping me
from kicking your butt.

1918
01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:28.303
Oh, come on, no.

1919
01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.505
Not my face, it's much newer
than the girls'.

1920
01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:30.505
Go for the girls!

1921
01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:31.672
Mom!

1922
01:18:31.672 --> 01:18:32.940
BRIANNA:
No, don't!

1923
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.509
SAM:
Rhonda? Rhonda!

1924
01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.777
She's not even worth it.

1925
01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:37.478
( grunts )

1926
01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:38.846
( screams loudly )

1927
01:18:38.846 --> 01:18:40.048
You're right.

1928
01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:42.650
You know what?
I quit, too.

1929
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:44.052
Me, too.

1930
01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:46.687
Hey, Rhonda, Eleanor, hold up.
I need a ride.

1931
01:18:46.687 --> 01:18:49.191
See ya.

1932
01:18:50.558 --> 01:18:52.394
Well...

1933
01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.996
See ya.

1934
01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.134
Send me a bill.

1935
01:19:02.103 --> 01:19:05.073
Fiona actually thought that
you were gonna slug her.

1936
01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.273
I was gonna do
more than that.

1937
01:19:06.273 --> 01:19:09.710
I had no idea that
you were that tough.

1938
01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:14.649
Yeah, but I always knew
that you were.

1939
01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:15.650
Rhonda...

1940
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.184
( sighs )

1941
01:19:17.184 --> 01:19:19.821
...are you sure
that this is okay?

1942
01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:24.760
Sam, I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1943
01:19:28.963 --> 01:19:30.432
( sighs )

1944
01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:33.034
I haven't felt this much at home
in such a long time.

1945
01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:34.602
( chuckling ):
I'm sure,

1946
01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:36.271
compared to the Addams Family.

1947
01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:39.006
( laughs )

1948
01:19:39.006 --> 01:19:40.575
What's on your mind?

1949
01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.511
I got to do something tonight.

1950
01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:45.113
Don't wait up for me, okay?

Sam...

1968
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:26.321
Okay, I know that you think
that I'm just some...

1969
01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:27.555
Coward? Phony?

1970
01:20:27.555 --> 01:20:28.756
Okay, just listen.

1971
01:20:28.756 --> 01:20:30.158
No, you listen.

1972
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.293
You turned out to be exactly
who I thought you were.

1973
01:20:32.293 --> 01:20:34.796
I never pretended
to be somebody else.

1974
01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.297
It's been me all along,

1975
01:20:36.297 --> 01:20:38.732
and it was me who was
hurt in front of everybody.

01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:43.137
I didn't come here
to yell at you, okay?

1979
01:20:43.137 --> 01:20:46.307
I came to tell you that
I know what it feels like

1980
01:20:46.307 --> 01:20:48.810
to be afraid to
show who you are.

1981
01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.311
I was, but I'm not anymore.

1982
01:20:50.311 --> 01:20:52.447
And the thing is,
is I really don't care

1983
01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:55.149
what people think about me,
because I believe in myself.

1984
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:58.285
And I know that things
are gonna be okay.

1985
01:20:58.285 --> 01:21:00.788
But even though
I have no family

1986
01:21:00.788 --> 01:21:03.057
and no job and no
money for college,

1987
01:21:03.057 --> 01:21:05.393
it's you that I
feel sorry for.

1988
01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.728
DAVID:
Heads up.

1989
01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.929
Yo, five minutes.

1990
01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.096
I'm coming.

1991
01:21:09.096 --> 01:21:11.666
I know that guy that
sent those e-mails

1992
01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.935
is somewhere down
inside of you,

1993
01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.436
but I can't wait for him,

1994
01:21:15.436 --> 01:21:18.106
( voice breaking ):
because waiting for you

1995
01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:21.676
is like waiting for
rain in this drought:

1996
01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:24.379
useless and disappointing.

1997
01:21:27.381 --> 01:21:29.684
Sam!

1998
01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:30.952

2002
01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:42.831
Hey! W-What are
you doing here?

2003
01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.131
Rhonda told me
where you might be.

2004
01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:46.734
I thought you could
use a friend.

2005
01:21:46.734 --> 01:21:47.835
Come here.

2006

How do you feel?

2010
01:21:56.644 --> 01:21:58.512
Uh, I'll let you know
when I can catch my breath.

2011
01:21:58.512 --> 01:22:00.347
( chuckles ):
Let's do something tonight.

2012
01:22:00.347 --> 01:22:03.251
Well, I was actually, uh...
thinking about going...

2013
01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.785
( chuckling ):
to... the game, uh...

2014
01:22:04.785 --> 01:22:08.723
but I understand if you
don't want to do that.

2015
01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.792
No, I'll go.

2016
01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.793
Really. You'll go to the game.

2017
01:22:12.793 --> 01:22:16.831
Yeah. I can handle it now.
It'll be our first and last.

2018
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.065
And, besides, if I don't go,

2019
01:22:18.065 --> 01:22:19.834

the game to you?
