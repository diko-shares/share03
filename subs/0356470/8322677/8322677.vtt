00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:46.257
Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom,
lived a beautiful little girl...

4
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.556
and her widowed father.

5
00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.535
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:59.971
Okay. It wasn 't that long ago.
And it wasn 't really a faraway kingdom.

7
00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.839
It was the San Fernando Valley.
It looked faraway...

8
00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:05.480
because you barely see it
through the smog.

9
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:09.049
But to me, growing up,
the Valley was my kingdom.

10
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:19.691
I was my dad's best friend.
And he was mine.

11
00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.499
Being raised by a man put me behind in
the makeup and fashion departments.

12
00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.000
But I never felt like I missed out
on anything.

13
00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.671
I was the luckiest girl in the world.

14
00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:38.070
My dad owned the coolest diner.
I loved hanging out there.

15
00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.421
Diet was a four-letter word here...

16
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.855
and grease came
at no additional charge.

17
00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:54.355
A t Hal's, everyone felt like family.

18
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.829
Oh, yeah, I have drinks.

19
00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:03.504
Happy birthday!

20
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.469
Make a wish, princess.

21
00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:10.409
What did I need a wish for?
I had amazing friends and the coolest dad.

22
00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:20.320
But I guess my dad thought I needed
one more thing; Fiona.

23
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.151
I am so sorry.

24
00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:26.894
You Iook beautiful, Fiona.

25
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.963
Hey, Hal!

26
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:36.629
Along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.

27
00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.775
My out-of-step-sisters.

28
00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:45.142
But as long as my dad was happy, so was I.
We were going to be one big, happy family.

29
00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.839
Cheese.

30
00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:49.612
One' s enough.

31
00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:52.983
Unfortunately, this was no fairy tale.

32
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.725
" He took her hand, and he kissed it.

33
00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:58.952
Then he swooped her up onto
his horse.

34
00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:05.161
And the beautiful princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castle...

35
00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:11.274
where they Iived happily ever after."

36
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.569
Do fairy tales come true, Dad?

37
00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:18.544
Well, no. But dreams come true.

38
00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.081
- Do you have a dream?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.311
My dream is that you'II grow up
and go to college...

40
00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:27.650
and then maybe someday you'II build
your own castle.

41
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:31.151
Where do princesses go to college?

42
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:35.056
They go...

43
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.392
where the princes go.

44
00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.558
They go to Princeton.

45
00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:43.604
But, sam, you know, fairy tales aren't
just about finding handsome princes.

46
00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.342
They're about fulfilling your dreams...

47
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.638
and about standing up for what
you believe in.

48
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.577
As I always say, never Iet the
fear of striking out—

49
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.048
- keep you from playing the game.
- Right.

50
00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:01.480
Just remember, if you Iook carefully,
this book contains important things...

51
00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.684
that you may need to know
Iater in Iife.

52
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.973
- Earthquake.
- My kingdom crumbled...

53
00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.075
during the Northridge earthquake.

54
00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:22.404
Help! Help!

55
00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:25.547
- Don't go.
- I'II be right back.

56
00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.021
I lost my best friend that day.

57
00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.756
From then on, the only fairy tales
in my life...

58
00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:45.526
were the ones I read about in books.

59
00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:56.077
Since my father didn 't leave a will,
my stepmother got everything.

60
00:04:56.245 --> 00:05:02.650
The house, the diner,
and to her dismay, me.

61
00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.093
Sam.

62
00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.230
Sammy.

63
00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:58.867
Sam!

64
00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:01.572
It's breakfast time.

65
00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.542
So bring me my breakfast.

66
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.345
Sam!

67
00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:17.450
Careful, Iadies. Look for the eyes.
One, two, three, bicycle.

68
00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:24.861
And feint. Magpie, magpie, magpie.
FIap and flap and flap. Mary Lou Retton!

69
00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:28.663
Palm tree and palm tree.
Lady Liberty. Lady Liberty.

70
00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:31.705
Around the harbor. Around the harbor.
Circle Line tour.

71
00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:34.240
And hurricane.

72
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.607
Can you believe how extraordinarily
gifted my girls are?

73
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.272
Absolutely unbelievable. Really.

74
00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:44.818
- sam!
- Find each other. Look in the eyes.

75
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:47.251
- I'm coming.
- One, two, three and four...

76
00:06:47.423 --> 00:06:49.220
and right, Ieft, up and down.

77
00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:53.089
Is this the Norwegian salmon I asked for?
I need my omega-3s.

78
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:54.925
Only the best.

79
00:06:58.201 --> 00:06:59.930
I can tell.

80
00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:04.199
You know, it costs a fortune to fly
that stuff in from Norwegia.

81
00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.171
And push it, Iadies. Push it, Iadies.
Push it, Iadies.

82
00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:08.867
Ready? Okay.

83
00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.216
- Gross. Mom!
- I have a spastic colon.

84
00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:20.617
Well, you have a spastic brain.

85
00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:23.388
- stop. Stop hitting her. Stop.
- You bit me.

86
00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:26.762
What are you doing just standing there?
Get to work.

87
00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:30.262
I can't go to work now.
I've got a big test I have to study for.

88
00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:36.394
Listen, sam. People go to school
to get smarter...

89
00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:39.268
so that they can get a job.

90
00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:43.071
You already have a job.
so it's Iike skipping a step.

91
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.441
Come on, get going.

92
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.978
And FIying Karamazov.

93
00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:59.360
No, honey. Leave those on.

94
00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:01.156
The Iawn Iooks a Iittle brown.

95
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.926
Fiona, we're supposed to be conserving
water. We're in the middle of a drought.

96
00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.933
Droughts are for poor people.

97
00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.832
Do you think J. Lo has a brown Iawn?

98
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:16.539
People who use extra water
have extra class.

99
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:56.414
You call that grade-A beef? Well, that cow
must have cheated on his test.

100
00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:02.419
Pickup.

101
00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:09.925
Bobby, enough with the salmon.

102
00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:14.900
You already made a salmon omelet, salmon
soup and salmon pudding. Come on.

103
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:18.097
- Help me. Fiona wants to eat me.
- That's nasty.

104
00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:21.675
- Bite me, Rhonda. Bite me.
- That's nasty.

105
00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:26.208
- EIeanor, your order's up.
- Coming. I got it.

106
00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:27.815
safe.

107
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.576
I'm okay.

108
00:09:29.752 --> 00:09:31.617
- Chuck, how you doing?
- super.

109
00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:36.952
That's good. So cheese omelet,
extra bacon, crisp...

110
00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:39.993
- ... blueberry muffin and a Coke.
- Make it a Diet Coke.

111
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.630
I'm trying to watch my weight.

112
00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:44.629
It ain't going nowhere.

113
00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:48.397
Pick up these salmon waffles.

114
00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:55.036
- sam, why are you still here?
- I'm almost done.

115
00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.543
- You'II be Iate for school.
- I'II get there.

116
00:09:57.713 --> 00:10:00.773
- Fiona goes ballistic if I don't finish.
- I don't care.

117
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.884
What I care about is your education.

118
00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:05.850
she's got you getting up
at the crack of dawn.

119
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.252
- Your dad would want you at school.
- But—

120
00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:13.088
No more "buts." You just Ieave Fiona
and her big butt to me.

121
00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:16.158
- Thanks, Rhonda.
- Get.

122
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.975
hey, Iooking good, Mr. Farrell.

123
00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:32.774
A man's best friend is his Mercedes,
sam.

124
00:10:33.316 --> 00:10:34.578
I'II remember that.

125
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.848
Any— Anything is possible
if you just believe.

126
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:42.513
- Anything is possible if you just—
- Audition today, son?

127
00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:47.322
- Yeah, 5:00, all right? Tell Mom.
- knock them dead.

128
00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:54.668
Dad. Now, do you see what I have to go
to school in? No offense, sam.

129
00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:56.862
honestly, don't you feel sorry
for me?

130
00:10:57.206 --> 00:11:00.801
No, I feel sorry about the three cars
we got you that you totaled.

131
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.445
Okay. AII right.

132
00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:11.719
- Carter, what are you wearing?
- What—?

133
00:11:11.887 --> 00:11:13.650
This is my Snoop Dizzle Iook.

134
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.381
I cannot drive you to school Iike that.

135
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.725
sam, I am a Method actor, okay?
This is part of my training.

136
00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:26.129
I know, I know, I know. But Iook at this.

137
00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:29.667
AII right. Take two.

138
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.572
Buenos dias, Fighting Frogs.

139
00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.614
here's your daily drought reminder
to conserve agua.

140
00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.546
Cut your showers short.

141
00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:46.882
Brownie points go out to Mr. Rothman,
who hasn't had one in weeks.

142
00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.752
Remember, today's your last chance
to get tickets...

143
00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:52.723
to the big Halloween homecoming
dance.

144
00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:56.729
You too can dress up Iike someone
you're not, for a change.

145
00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.663
- I mean, I—
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...

146
00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:03.896
of the United states of America,
and to the republic...

147
00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:06.268
for which it stands, one nation—

148
00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:08.603
Primo parking spot dead ahead.

149
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:12.407
- Okay, there's a spot. There's a spot.
- sam, watch out. Watch out.

150
00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:16.144
Okay. You snooze, you Iose!

151
00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:20.448
Well, if it isn't shelby Cummings
and her Iadies in waiting.

152
00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:25.354
- shelby wants me so bad.
- You've never even talked to her before.

153
00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:27.519
Oh, I've talked to her. Okay?

154
00:12:27.696 --> 00:12:34.101
In my mind. And Iet me tell you,
in my mind, she wants me so bad.

155
00:12:34.403 --> 00:12:38.897
Carter, you could do so much better than
shelby Cummings. Even in your mind.

156
00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:41.736
- There's another spot.
- Got it.

157
00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:49.346
Come on.

158
00:13:05.134 --> 00:13:06.931
Austin.

159
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.365
People Iike Shelby and Austin...

160
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.063
are genetically programmed
to find each other.

161
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.471
How can so much ego be
in one relationship?

162
00:13:14.743 --> 00:13:18.975
- Imagine what they say about you.
- They don't even know I exist.

163
00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:23.751
stalkerazzi at 3 o'clock.

164
00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:27.912
The white zone is for cool people only.
No geeks.

165
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:33.588
hey, diner girl, can I get a
breakfast burrito to go? Thank you.

166
00:13:33.762 --> 00:13:35.992
And you thought they didn't
know you exist.

167
00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:38.326
- That car's as old as that hat.
- Right.

168
00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:42.699
Move. Move. Move.

169
00:13:42.872 --> 00:13:45.932
- Move. Move.
- Hi.

170
00:13:46.108 --> 00:13:49.839
shelby. Hey, sister-friend.

171
00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:52.173
Remind me why we tolerate them.

172
00:13:52.348 --> 00:13:54.612
They gave you a Prada bag
for your birthday.

173
00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:57.445
Try " Frada" bag. Totally fake.

174
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:10.528
Greetings. Samantha, you Iook absolutely
stunning today, as per usual.

175
00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:12.394
Thank you, Terry.

176
00:14:12.568 --> 00:14:16.402
If you'II excuse me, I must get back
to my galaxy now.

177
00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:20.433
Zion, Lieutenant Terry here. Hello?

178
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:23.635
Can you hear me? Captain?
You're going in and out.

179
00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:26.645
- Poor guy.
- At Ieast he's happy.

180
00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:30.717
- Happy? Guy Iives in another world.
- I copy.

181
00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:34.151
sometimes fantasy is better
than reality, Carter.

182
00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:42.994
- speaking of fantasy.
- I'II see you Iater.

183
00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:46.931
Yes, the secret admirer beckons.

184
00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:56.375
Where have you been?
We haven 't talked in ages.

185
00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:00.074
We talked this morning.

186
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.675
I can 't stop thinking about you.

187
00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:06.384
What's on your mind right now?

188
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.782
You first.

189
00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:16.564
Well, I'm thinking that Professor Rothman 's
dissected one too many frogs.

190
00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:30.202
Ribet, ribet.

191
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:33.646
Laugh out Ioud.

192
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.353
I wanna hear your laugh.
When can we finally meet?

193
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.168
Soon.

194
00:16:02.077 --> 00:16:04.568
How's your day so far?

195
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.579
Raging stepmom, work and cool kids
who can 't get over themselves.

196
00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:12.243
- Ever feel like you don 't belong?
- Absolutely.

197
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:17.081
I can be surrounded by a sea
of people and still feel all alone.

198
00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:19.523
Then I think of you.

199
00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:24.463
Hey, Nomad, do you think
we've ever met?

200
00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:29.699
I don 't know. Our school
has over 3500 kids.

201
00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:32.500
Well, that narrows it down.

202
00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:35.439
Well, at least I can eliminate the guys.

203
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:40.145
You're not a guy, right? Because if you are,
I'll kick your butt.

204
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.518
I am not a guy.

205
00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:46.751
Have you told your dad
about Princeton yet?

206
00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:51.188
If only I could. I haven 't even told him
I wanna be a writer.

207
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.090
My father always encouraged me
to pursue my dreams.

208
00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:58.359
Not mine. He has another plan
for my life.

209
00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:02.396
It's 2 a.m. We've been at this
for five hours.

210
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.170
Well, I think we broke our record.

211
00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:11.206
- We should turn in. Sweet dreams.
- Wait.

212
00:17:13.082 --> 00:17:15.744
I can 't sleep without knowing
there 's hope.

213
00:17:16.585 --> 00:17:20.043
Half the night I waste in sighs.

214
00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:23.185
In a wakeful doze I sorrow.

215
00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:28.287
For the hand, the lips...

216
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:30.762
the eyes.

217
00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:33.299
For the meeting of tomorrow.

218
00:17:33.902 --> 00:17:36.894
Quoting Tennyson. Impressive.

219
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.664
Please meet me at the
homecoming dance.

220
00:17:39.842 --> 00:17:44.370
I'll be waiting for you at 11 ;00
in the middle of the dance floor.

221
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.084
sweet dreams.

222
00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:55.686
That was close.

223
00:17:55.858 --> 00:18:01.057
- You're finally gonna be able to meet him.
- I don't know. He's too good to be true.

224
00:18:06.068 --> 00:18:10.596
Come on. It's been, Iike, a month since you
met him in that Princeton chat room, okay?

225
00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:15.176
- You talk to him all the time. You know him.
- I know, but he doesn't know me.

226
00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:18.006
What if I meet him
and I'm not what he expects?

227
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.638
Maybe this whole relationship's
just better for cyberspace.

228
00:18:25.654 --> 00:18:28.987
Listen, okay? You have to go
to that dance, okay?

229
00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:33.788
This Nomad guy isn't gonna be in one place
for Iong, all right?

230
00:18:33.962 --> 00:18:36.795
- If it helps, I'II be your escort.
- Really?

231
00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:40.660
- Yeah.
- You rock, Carter.

232
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.871
- hello?
- Sam.

233
00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:50.573
some Iittle brat got into my salmon
and ate it all.

234
00:18:50.746 --> 00:18:54.580
I need more salmon.
And pick up my dry cleaning.

235
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.308
And wash the Jag.

236
00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:00.782
Fiona. One more pitch.

237
00:19:00.956 --> 00:19:05.825
- Why do you act Iike her slave?
- simple. No Fiona, no money for Princeton.

238
00:19:05.994 --> 00:19:07.985
- That sucks.
- Tell me about it.

239
00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:18.629
Hey, it's out of here.

240
00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:27.474
Damn, a girl hit that.
see, now that's impressive.

241
00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:31.278
so, what are you and shelby going
to the dance as?

242
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:34.881
I don't know if I'm going with Shelby.

243
00:19:35.057 --> 00:19:38.652
You're not gonna go with shelby?
Who else you gonna go with?

244
00:19:39.228 --> 00:19:41.788
I don't know. It's a mystery to me.

245
00:19:41.964 --> 00:19:45.161
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

246
00:19:45.334 --> 00:19:48.462
Okay, guys. Come on.
A Iittle bit further. Right there.

247
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.834
Thirty percent off for USC alumni.

248
00:19:58.247 --> 00:20:01.080
Looks good, my friend.
Make sure you get these rims.

249
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.741
- Austin.
- What's up?

250
00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.979
What's with all those college brochures
in your bedroom?

251
00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:09.282
What are you doing in my room?

252
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:14.258
- I'm trying to keep my options open.
- You don't need options.

253
00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:16.920
It is all taken care of.

254
00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:22.162
Look, son, we've been working on this
program since you were 9 years old.

255
00:20:22.337 --> 00:20:24.828
You're gonna play UsC football,
graduate...

256
00:20:25.007 --> 00:20:28.875
and then you'II manage this business
with me. Your future's set.

257
00:20:29.044 --> 00:20:32.036
so don't mess with the plan. AII right?

258
00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:34.375
Wouldn't think of it.

259
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:37.746
There's another customer.
Go make them happy.

260
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.052
Yes, sir, here's your car.

261
00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.989
Well, you need a wax.

262
00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:49.693
- Excuse me?
- I meant the car.

263
00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:52.126
Oh, fine.

264
00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:04.935
- Austin.
- hi.

265
00:21:05.113 --> 00:21:07.138
- We need our cars washed.
- Yeah, Iook.

266
00:21:07.316 --> 00:21:09.546
Dirt.

267
00:21:11.486 --> 00:21:13.386
One second, Iadies. AII right.

268
00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:17.286
Take this inside when you're done.
Thank you very much.

269
00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:20.257
Oh, my God, he is an angel.

270
00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:22.624
- He's so cute.
- I know.

271
00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:26.666
so who'd you guys pay to make
your cars so dirty?

272
00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:31.602
Excuse me? Like, what are you,
the dirt police?

273
00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:33.536
Yeah. The dirt police.

274
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:38.146
Like, excuse me, miss, do you know
how fast your dirt was going?

275
00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:40.907
You should have stopped
with the dirt police.

276
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.687
You should get going,
because our mom's Iooking for you.

277
00:21:45.854 --> 00:21:49.517
- Well, where is she?
- she's at home, baking.

278
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:54.491
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

279
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.360
Oh, my— Did you finish your errands?

280
00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:03.163
Because I need you to head to the diner
and take the night shift.

281
00:22:04.272 --> 00:22:07.867
Tonight's my night off and it's
the halloween dance at school, so—

282
00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:13.345
I know, but you need to stop being so
self-centered and start thinking of others.

283
00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:16.916
Others need you to go to the diner
and mop the floors tonight.

284
00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:20.543
But I really need to go to this dance,
Fiona. I have to.

285
00:22:20.722 --> 00:22:23.623
You need to earn your tuition money
for college.

286
00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:26.625
You gotta bus a Iot of tables.

287
00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:32.597
I'm a straight-A student. I work seven days
a week and I'm taking extra AP classes.

288
00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:37.796
I never asked you for anything.
PIease Iet me go to this dance.

289
00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:42.638
sweetheart, now that you're
old enough...

290
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:47.475
there's something I've always wanted to
tell you, and I think you're ready to hear it.

291
00:22:48.383 --> 00:22:51.580
You're not very pretty,
and you're not very bright.

292
00:22:53.989 --> 00:22:55.684
I'm so glad we had that talk.

293
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.760
- Man, you—
- scoot over, bro.

294
00:23:06.935 --> 00:23:09.904
- see if we can get a bigger table.
- Move over.

295
00:23:12.741 --> 00:23:14.106
You're in my way.

296
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:21.708
It must be halloween. Look what just
flew in. The wicked witch of the Valley.

297
00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:25.683
I'm gonna be picking up Gabriella
and Brianna at the halloween dance.

298
00:23:25.854 --> 00:23:29.415
- I'II be back by 12 sharp.
- Okay.

299
00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:33.919
still got room in there, huh?

300
00:23:34.096 --> 00:23:38.863
Well, if it isn't Iittle Betty Crocker
from the 'hood.

301
00:23:39.034 --> 00:23:41.969
Don't you have something to do,
Iike cleaning toilets?

302
00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:46.574
You know, I would, but I'm too busy
running this place. But be my guest.

303
00:23:47.142 --> 00:23:52.045
I'm sorry, I can't, because I just got
a $150 manicure. Silver palm trees.

304
00:23:53.982 --> 00:23:58.248
Keep it up, Fiona, and I'm gonna find
a place to put my $6 pedicure.

305
00:23:58.587 --> 00:24:01.385
Where are your skates?
That's part of the uniform.

306
00:24:01.556 --> 00:24:05.219
Fiona, if I wanted to Iook Iike a clown,
I'd join the circus.

307
00:24:05.393 --> 00:24:10.456
If you were part of my circus, I'd have you
clean elephant butts with a Wet One.

308
00:24:10.632 --> 00:24:14.966
- I don't think you realize that I could—
- Fire me? Oh, please, go right ahead.

309
00:24:15.137 --> 00:24:18.732
And Iet's see how many customers
you have Ieft when you do.

310
00:24:19.841 --> 00:24:23.072
I am a very appealing person.

311
00:24:27.249 --> 00:24:29.547
Yeah, in your head.

312
00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:37.087
- "I'm a very appealing person."
- "I'm a very appealing person."

313
00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:39.056
That woman can make a nun swear.

314
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:43.561
I'm graduating a year early so I can
be 3000 miles away in Princeton.

315
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:49.500
You could go to the University of Mars
and it still wouldn't be far enough.

316
00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:51.035
Honey, I'm desperate.

317
00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:53.674
- Can you cover that back booth?
- We're waiting.

318
00:24:53.842 --> 00:24:57.107
- I don't think I can eat anything here.
- But—

319
00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:03.977
I have the feeling I won't be able
to get a Zone meal here.

320
00:25:04.152 --> 00:25:07.952
- I already ate.
- Laxatives don't qualify as a food group.

321
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.218
- surprised you didn't know that.
- stop it.

322
00:25:11.393 --> 00:25:15.124
Well, if it isn't diner girl.

323
00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:18.789
- What can I get you guys?
- What can I get here that has no sugar...

324
00:25:18.967 --> 00:25:22.061
- ... no carbs and is fat-free?
- Water.

325
00:25:22.237 --> 00:25:25.536
- Water? Feisty.
- Was that supposed to be a joke?

326
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:27.306
It was funny.

327
00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:29.807
- I'II have a Voss.
- Excuse me?

328
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:33.046
- It's water. From Norway.
- she's the worst.

329
00:25:33.748 --> 00:25:38.913
- sorry, we only have water from the Valley.
- Oh, well, then I'II have an iced tea.

330
00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:41.419
Make that two.
And I'm still waiting...

331
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.650
- ... on that breakfast burrito, diner girl.
- see you.

332
00:25:44.826 --> 00:25:48.262
- Thank you.
- she is so not getting a tip.

333
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.491
shelby, we really need to talk.
Privately.

334
00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:56.660
Anything you say to me,
you can say in front of my peeps.

335
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.566
Okay.

336
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.270
I wanna break up.

337
00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:04.673
What?

338
00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:06.074
That was harsh.

339
00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:09.046
- Are you in Iove with somebody else?
- I think so.

340
00:26:09.217 --> 00:26:11.082
- No way.
- What? Who, bro?

341
00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:12.982
I don't know.

342
00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:17.487
- But we can still be—
- Don't say the word "friends."

343
00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:21.925
Fortunately for you, I'm gonna overlook
this mental breakdown of yours.

344
00:26:22.097 --> 00:26:27.228
Look, just chill out. We're gonna go get
ready for the dance, and I'II see you there.

345
00:26:29.037 --> 00:26:31.562
- Later.
- Late.

346
00:26:32.374 --> 00:26:35.571
- That went well, bro.
- No, she took it well.

347
00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:38.372
Good Iooking out.

348
00:26:38.546 --> 00:26:41.413
- Later, diner girl.
- Too Iate.

349
00:26:43.618 --> 00:26:45.483
Don't worry about it.

350
00:26:50.725 --> 00:26:54.388
You know, those kids remind me
of why I used to fight in school.

351
00:26:57.499 --> 00:26:59.592
Have no fear.

352
00:27:00.402 --> 00:27:02.063
Zorro is here.

353
00:27:03.605 --> 00:27:07.063
And he's got the keys
to his dad's Mercedes.

354
00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:10.067
You're going dressed as a bus girl?

355
00:27:10.245 --> 00:27:13.442
- Carter, I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

356
00:27:13.615 --> 00:27:19.019
- Okay, sorry. Sorry. What about cyberdude?
- Cyberdude?

357
00:27:19.187 --> 00:27:21.883
That the boy that's been sending
you Iove notes?

358
00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:24.855
They're not Iove notes. They're e-mails.

359
00:27:25.026 --> 00:27:29.622
If a man is taking his time to write down
his feelings for you, it's a Iove note.

360
00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:32.460
You've got a secret admirer.

361
00:27:32.634 --> 00:27:36.035
And he wants to meet her tonight
at the dance.

362
00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:39.002
- What are you still doing here?
- I'm obeying orders.

363
00:27:39.174 --> 00:27:42.940
- sam, this is your true Iove.
- Well, true Iove is gonna have to wait.

364
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:47.673
Oh, girl, please, save all that drama for the
soap operas. You are going to that dance.

365
00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:50.181
Go ahead, girlfriend.

366
00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:55.551
I can't go. Fiona would kill me and then
bring me back to clean up the mess.

367
00:27:55.724 --> 00:27:58.284
she's gonna have to
go through me to hurt you.

368
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.123
- Go, girlfriend. Do your thing.
- Call me "girlfriend" one more time.

369
00:28:02.297 --> 00:28:03.662
Okay, sorry.

370
00:28:03.832 --> 00:28:07.393
sam, your dad did not Ieave this earth
wanting you to be unhappy.

371
00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:11.300
It's time for you to find your own bliss,
starting with this dance.

372
00:28:11.473 --> 00:28:13.907
sam, you need to Iisten to Rhonda.

373
00:28:14.075 --> 00:28:17.636
You're always studying, always working.
Take some time for yourself.

374
00:28:17.812 --> 00:28:20.576
Yeah, why don't you go out
and bust a move.

375
00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:25.083
- Put your freak on.
- Whatever it is you kids do these days.

376
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.246
You know what? You guys are right.
I never do anything for myself.

377
00:28:30.492 --> 00:28:31.754
- No, you don't.
- True.

378
00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:33.822
And I deserve to have some fun.

379
00:28:33.995 --> 00:28:35.553
- That's right.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.131
- I am gonna go to that dance.
- Okay, great.

381
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.031
And I am gonna meet my true Iove
and I'm gonna dance all night.

382
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.044
- I can't go.
- What?

383
00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:52.907
I don't have a costume.

384
00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:58.880
- But you will. Are you coming, Zorro?
- Yes, ma'am.

385
00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:09.290
Vernon. Sam needs a costume.

386
00:29:09.464 --> 00:29:12.433
No. No, Rhonda. I am closed.

387
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.899
Come on, I'II give you free breakfast
for a week.

388
00:29:16.938 --> 00:29:19.202
Make it a month.

389
00:29:20.475 --> 00:29:22.875
There's gotta be something here.

390
00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:25.979
There is this one.

391
00:29:29.918 --> 00:29:31.943
Perfect.

392
00:29:34.255 --> 00:29:35.483
No way.

393
00:29:38.059 --> 00:29:40.254
hey, you're killing me here.

394
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.925
AIoha.

395
00:29:48.102 --> 00:29:50.195
No, no. I got something.

396
00:29:53.975 --> 00:29:55.875
BIess you.

397
00:29:58.379 --> 00:30:00.813
Rhonda, this is hopeless.

398
00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:09.147
Vernon, Iet me see that mask.

399
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:15.891
I don't have an outfit
that goes with that.

400
00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:17.964
Yeah, but I do.

401
00:30:28.142 --> 00:30:33.808
Rhonda, you sure do have a knack for taking
something simple and making it beautiful.

402
00:30:36.484 --> 00:30:39.783
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

403
00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:44.816
I was saving this dress for my
next attempt down the aisle.

404
00:30:47.028 --> 00:30:48.962
Long story.

405
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.668
It's beautiful.

406
00:30:55.403 --> 00:31:01.171
- Rhonda, I can't wear that.
- Yes, you can. And you will.

407
00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:06.478
That dress has been in that box so Iong,
it deserves a night out.

408
00:31:08.082 --> 00:31:09.379
Let's go.

409
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:12.315
This is gonna Iook so good on you.

410
00:31:19.794 --> 00:31:24.390
Welcome, North Valley high school seniors
to the halloween homecoming dance.

411
00:31:24.566 --> 00:31:29.060
Tonight, our panel of esteemed teachers
will use their years of higher education...

412
00:31:29.437 --> 00:31:32.338
to choose our homecoming
prince and princess.

413
00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:36.338
In true L.A. fashion,
it's not about who you are.

414
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:41.676
It's about what you wear.
Are you ready to crank it up? Yeah.

415
00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:50.253
I cannot believe I put you in charge
of costumes.

416
00:31:50.425 --> 00:31:55.055
I told you siamese cats,
not siamese twins.

417
00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:58.460
Are we having a catfight?

418
00:32:08.876 --> 00:32:10.138
- Welcome, guys.
- What up?

419
00:32:10.311 --> 00:32:13.178
- sorry about your costume getting Iost.
- It's all good.

420
00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:16.317
No, it's not. We don't get to be
the Three Musketeers.

421
00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:20.147
You get to be Prince Charming
and we're the two wimps in wigs.

422
00:32:25.326 --> 00:32:27.886
Take the cape off already.
You Iook amazing.

423
00:32:28.062 --> 00:32:31.828
- I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out here.
- Listen, it's gonna be okay.

424
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.094
- hurry up, it's almost 11.
- Carter, wait.

425
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:38.102
Remember, I have to be back
in the diner by 12, okay?

426
00:32:38.272 --> 00:32:41.070
Okay, give me your cell phone.
Come on, cell phone.

427
00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:48.373
Okay. AII right, I'm going to set the alarm
for a quarter to 12, okay?

428
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:52.349
- Okay.
- AII right, there. Now, give me the cape.

429
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.078
Come on, it's time

430
00:33:13.307 --> 00:33:16.208
sam, what are they all staring at?

431
00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:03.556
Love her dress. Hate her.

432
00:34:15.737 --> 00:34:18.399
sam, don't worry, okay?

433
00:34:18.573 --> 00:34:24.239
Any guy would have to be completely
insane not to Iike you, all right?

434
00:34:24.412 --> 00:34:27.279
I'm just gonna be standing
right over here. Okay.

435
00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:43.453
Do you know you're standing precisely
in the middle of the dance floor?

436
00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:49.836
Fate has brought us together right here
at this anointed hour...

437
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:52.234
under the shimmering disco ball.

438
00:34:54.075 --> 00:34:55.770
Terry.

439
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.169
- Are you Nomad?
- Nomad?

440
00:34:59.914 --> 00:35:05.045
Indeed. I have traveled through time
and space to find you.

441
00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:07.449
Now join me in the
mating dance of Zion.

442
00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:16.586
Terry, that's nice.

443
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:20.824
hey, I know that girl from somewhere.

444
00:35:23.738 --> 00:35:28.175
- I'm thirsty. I gotta get some punch—
- some Iibations for the fair maiden?

445
00:35:28.342 --> 00:35:30.503
Your wish is my command.

446
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.846
I knew this was too good to be true.

447
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:43.323
Princeton Girl?

448
00:35:49.764 --> 00:35:52.232
Austin Ames?

449
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.234
- You're Nomad?
- Yeah, I guess my costume doesn't do...

450
00:35:56.404 --> 00:36:01.000
- ... a very good job at hiding who I am.
- No, I know exactly who you are.

451
00:36:02.143 --> 00:36:05.544
I'm sorry. This was a really big mistake.
I've gotta go.

452
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:10.615
Wait. Wait.

453
00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:12.878
Wait. It's not a mistake.

454
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:18.488
- Don't you know who I am?
- Of course I do. You're Princeton Girl.

455
00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:22.060
You're the girl I've been waiting to meet.
I know who you are.

456
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.788
What's your name?

457
00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:26.866
Your sweet Iibations, my Iady.

458
00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:29.264
Mr. Anderson.

459
00:36:29.904 --> 00:36:35.934
Austin Ames with my Iady.
A devastating blow.

460
00:36:36.477 --> 00:36:38.843
A worthy opponent.

461
00:36:44.552 --> 00:36:48.921
- What about your girlfriend?
- It's over.

462
00:36:58.132 --> 00:37:01.533
I guess you were expecting some guy
who hangs out at Starbucks...

463
00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:05.570
- ... and writes poetry.
- something Iike that.

464
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.365
Come on, you're Austin Ames.

465
00:37:08.542 --> 00:37:11.340
You're football captain
and student body president.

466
00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:16.275
And closet poet?
You can't be both guys.

467
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.908
- I'm not.
- Then who are you?

468
00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:24.751
On september 7th, I wrote you:

469
00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:29.363
"I Iive in a world full of people pretending
to be something they're not.

470
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.466
- But when I talk to you—"
- "I'm the guy I wanna be."

471
00:37:34.235 --> 00:37:36.931
Give me a chance to be that guy.

472
00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:39.965
Do you want to join me
for a stroll outside?

473
00:37:40.141 --> 00:37:43.633
If you wanna be voted homecoming prince,
you'd better stay inside.

474
00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:46.575
I really don't care about becoming
homecoming prince.

475
00:38:07.335 --> 00:38:11.533
so, Princeton Girl, would you tell me
who you are if I guessed it right?

476
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:14.903
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

477
00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:17.874
- Well, how about we play 20 questions.
- How about 10.

478
00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:19.637
I'II take what I can get.

479
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.018
Okay, first question.

480
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:28.287
You do actually go to
North Valley high school, right?

481
00:38:28.456 --> 00:38:30.651
- Of course.
- Look, I'm just checking.

482
00:38:30.825 --> 00:38:33.225
I mean, you never know
with the Internet.

483
00:38:33.861 --> 00:38:36.056
Okay, next question.

484
00:38:38.032 --> 00:38:41.195
Were you disappointed when you
found out that I was Nomad?

485
00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:46.338
- Be honest.
- surprisingly, no.

486
00:38:46.874 --> 00:38:49.604
Did you vote for me for
student body president?

487
00:38:49.777 --> 00:38:52.940
- surprisingly, yes.
- Really?

488
00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.415
Okay, I got it. Given the choice...

489
00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:59.712
would you rather have a rice cake
or a Big Mac?

490
00:38:59.887 --> 00:39:04.688
- A Big Mac. But what does that matter?
- Well, I Iike a girl with a hearty appetite.

491
00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:09.125
And besides, you just eliminated about
50 percent of the girls in our class.

492
00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:18.336
You'd think I'd remember those eyes.

493
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.332
You're so beautiful.

494
00:39:24.078 --> 00:39:26.308
Next question.

495
00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:30.044
What's up, girl?

496
00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:33.050
- What are you supposed to be?
- A Three Musketeer.

497
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.383
- You don't Iook Iike a candy bar.
- Right.

498
00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:39.025
Look, now that you
and Austin are toast...

499
00:39:39.393 --> 00:39:42.328
okay, why don't we
have our own Iittle party.

500
00:39:42.496 --> 00:39:45.522
- Back off, David.
- Come on, shelby. I know you Iike me.

501
00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:47.826
- No. Stop it. No.
- I know— I know it.

502
00:39:48.002 --> 00:39:49.731
- No, stop it. Stop.
- Come on.

503
00:39:49.904 --> 00:39:53.237
The Iady said, "Stop."

504
00:39:53.808 --> 00:39:55.207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

505
00:39:55.376 --> 00:39:57.674
- Give me that!
- Oh, God.

506
00:39:58.112 --> 00:40:00.376
I just saw your Iife flash
before your eyes.

507
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:06.048
Oh, yeah? Well, did you see the part
where I run away?

508
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:17.392
- That was awesome.
- Oh, you're dead, taco boy!

509
00:40:17.565 --> 00:40:19.396
Ladies.

510
00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:25.595
- You're mine!
- Move over, please.

511
00:40:34.548 --> 00:40:36.243
- It's over, dude.
- Oh, yeah?

512
00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:39.045
- Yeah.
- Well, I hate to tell you this, dude...

513
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.984
but I starred in Pirates of Penzance
three times.

514
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:45.223
- Oh, yeah?
- say hello to act two, scene one.

515
00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:08.911
If I ask you to dance,
does that count as a question?

516
00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:11.607
There's no music.

517
00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:13.948
so?

518
00:42:49.617 --> 00:42:52.108
AII out of questions?

519
00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:54.879
Do you believe in Iove at first sight?

520
00:42:56.924 --> 00:42:59.085
I'II Iet you know.

521
00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:04.795
- But I've seen you before?
- Yes.

522
00:43:05.266 --> 00:43:09.635
Man. How could I have
seen you before...

523
00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:11.598
and not know who you are now?

524
00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:16.068
Maybe you were Iooking,
but you weren't really seeing.

525
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:20.572
- You've got one more question Ieft.
- Okay.

526
00:43:27.488 --> 00:43:29.649
Do you, Princeton Girl...

527
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:34.416
feel Iike you made the right choice
meeting me here tonight?

528
00:43:36.397 --> 00:43:38.194
I do.

529
00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:43.833
And do you, Austin Ames,
ever wanna see me again after tonight?

530
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.835
I'd have to think about that.

531
00:43:50.644 --> 00:43:52.441
Absolutely.

532
00:44:02.756 --> 00:44:03.984
Not now.

533
00:44:04.158 --> 00:44:06.456
- What?
- I've gotta go.

534
00:44:06.694 --> 00:44:09.492
- You have a curfew or something?
- something Iike that.

535
00:44:09.663 --> 00:44:13.861
I'm sorry, but thank you.
This has been the most amazing night.

536
00:44:15.169 --> 00:44:16.898
- Where are you going?
- I'm Iate.

537
00:44:17.071 --> 00:44:20.302
- For what?
- Reality.

538
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:35.221
I was right in the middle
of a power jam.

539
00:44:35.389 --> 00:44:38.586
- You totally harshed my mellow.
- You'II get over it and Iive.

540
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:42.786
Hello! It is almost midnight.

541
00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:46.899
And that means it's time to announce
who we have selected...

542
00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:49.701
- What's up?
- have you seen the girl I was with?

543
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.031
No, I haven't seen her,
but you missed it.

544
00:44:52.206 --> 00:44:54.174
I beat some kid's butt. It was crazy.

545
00:44:56.076 --> 00:44:58.340
Now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

546
00:44:58.512 --> 00:45:02.004
- Carter? Carter. Carter, come on.
- Your new North Valley High...

547
00:45:02.182 --> 00:45:04.241
homecoming prince and princess...

548
00:45:04.418 --> 00:45:08.218
- I ' m gonna be Iate.
- ... are Prince Charming and Cinderella!

549
00:45:08.856 --> 00:45:11.689
It's you, bro. It's you.

550
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.757
My dear, I must bid you adieu.
I'm sorry.

551
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:21.264
- A what?
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.

552
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:23.269
Hurry up!

553
00:45:24.538 --> 00:45:31.034
Bravo! There he is, bravo! Looks Iike
Cinderella is playing hard to get.

554
00:45:57.704 --> 00:46:02.198
- I almost kissed Austin Ames!
- I totally, totally kissed shelby Cummings!

555
00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:07.075
Wait, so, what—? What did he say
when he found out that you were you?

556
00:46:08.215 --> 00:46:11.013
He didn't say, because he didn't find out.

557
00:46:11.185 --> 00:46:13.710
You didn't tell him? Why not?

558
00:46:13.887 --> 00:46:17.050
Carter, I Iive in an attic, okay?

559
00:46:17.224 --> 00:46:22.423
I drive a beat-up old car,
and he's expecting Malibu Barbie.

560
00:46:22.596 --> 00:46:25.292
I'II be doing him a favor
if I just disappear.

561
00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:27.628
- shotgun.
- Oh, no, I'm shotgun.

562
00:46:27.801 --> 00:46:29.530
- Get in already.
- stop pulling.

563
00:46:29.703 --> 00:46:32.433
Where are your crowns?
Where are your prizes?

564
00:46:32.606 --> 00:46:36.042
- Winners get prizes.
- We didn't win, Mom.

565
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.838
some girl stole it from us.

566
00:46:39.313 --> 00:46:43.841
I am very, very, very, very upset
about this.

567
00:46:44.618 --> 00:46:49.078
- You don't Iook upset.
- It's the Botox.

568
00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:51.986
I can't show emotion
for another hour and a half.

569
00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:55.754
- I told you she wanted me bad.
- Carter, just drive.

570
00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:02.659
- spam?
- spam?

571
00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:05.802
Mom!

572
00:47:05.973 --> 00:47:09.101
- It's sam! Over there.
- Over there.

573
00:47:09.443 --> 00:47:13.243
Hi, Mrs. Montgomery.

574
00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:20.578
- Mom, she was there. She's in the car.
- We saw her, Mom.

575
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:24.281
That's ridiculous.
she's working tonight.

576
00:47:24.458 --> 00:47:27.222
- she would never disobey me.
- she was there.

577
00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:29.021
- she was with him.
- In the car.

578
00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:30.823
- I saw—
- shut your cat face.

579
00:47:34.134 --> 00:47:36.466
- Did they see me?
- No, I don't think so...

580
00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:40.334
but the wannabe OIsen twins
might have.

581
00:47:45.946 --> 00:47:49.245
I know you wanna take care of this car,
but can you step on it?

582
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:53.777
In case you haven't noticed, I'm already
going 38 in a 35-mile zone, sam...

583
00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:56.149
so can you just Iay off, please?

584
00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.058
Come on, catch up to them.

585
00:47:59.226 --> 00:48:02.593
Will you speed up? We've got to
beat sam back to the diner.

586
00:48:02.763 --> 00:48:06.358
shut up, girls. We'II be back
at the diner soon enough.

587
00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:08.433
soon enough isn't soon enough!

588
00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:11.504
What are you doing?
Take your paw off the gas!

589
00:48:11.672 --> 00:48:13.367
I can't. It's stuck!

590
00:48:27.287 --> 00:48:29.448
Go, go.

591
00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:32.620
Carter, you could've totally
made that Iight.

592
00:48:32.793 --> 00:48:37.526
FYI, sam, yellow means slow down,
okay? Not speed up.

593
00:48:37.698 --> 00:48:41.657
I need The Fast and the Furious,
not Driving Miss Daisy.

594
00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:47.532
We're gonna die!

595
00:48:49.042 --> 00:48:50.942
Was that...?

596
00:48:56.149 --> 00:49:00.051
- Mother, stop!
- We're gonna die!

597
00:49:15.502 --> 00:49:17.936
I think I need to use the Iitter box.

598
00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:22.274
Oh, my God. My face is back.

599
00:49:28.115 --> 00:49:30.481
- I told you she wasn't here.
- No dope.

600
00:49:30.651 --> 00:49:33.245
- Where is Sam?
- What do you mean, where is Sam?

601
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.911
- Where do you think she is?
- she better be here.

602
00:49:36.089 --> 00:49:40.185
Fiona, I was gonna talk to you about
something that I really— Fiona, wait!

603
00:49:42.129 --> 00:49:44.620
I want my breasts done.
Where did you get those?

604
00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:47.198
san Diego. Excuse me.

605
00:49:47.367 --> 00:49:51.133
Did you notice how shiny the floors
are since we switched to Mr. CIean?

606
00:49:51.672 --> 00:49:54.766
What are you, a commercial? CIick.

607
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:56.772
Oh, mommy, oh.

608
00:49:56.943 --> 00:49:59.912
Fiona, I'm so glad you're here,
because...

609
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.811
The fish. Nemo is no more. Smell.

610
00:50:03.984 --> 00:50:07.351
- There is a tear in one of the booths.
- We were gonna tell you.

611
00:50:07.521 --> 00:50:09.682
What am I supposed to do
with a dead fish?

612
00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:13.185
Everyone, shut up!

613
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:17.096
When I find her, I'm gonna wring her—

614
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:19.061
Order's up.

615
00:50:20.534 --> 00:50:25.335
- sam. What are you doing back there?
- Just working on my cooking skills.

616
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.532
Yeah, I was teaching her to make
pancakes with salmon.

617
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:31.974
How was the dance, girls?

618
00:50:33.413 --> 00:50:36.712
You know, something stinks
around here.

619
00:50:36.883 --> 00:50:39.351
And it's not the fish.

620
00:50:42.055 --> 00:50:45.513
You're gonna get it. Come on, girls.

621
00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:58.867
We made it, and not a scratch.

622
00:51:04.144 --> 00:51:06.874
- Girls, come on.
- You bit me, you dumb face.

623
00:51:07.047 --> 00:51:09.413
Car smells Iike bad cheese.

624
00:51:15.722 --> 00:51:18.748
- Don't put your dirty paws all over me.
- Pushing me.

625
00:51:24.464 --> 00:51:26.227
What is he doing here?

626
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:35.834
Tonight must be my Iucky night.

627
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.943
Okay.

628
00:51:56.429 --> 00:51:57.828
Mrs. Montgomery...

629
00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:02.063
your sign hit my...

630
00:52:02.736 --> 00:52:04.533
car.

631
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.307
—gozaimasu, Fighting Frogs.
Here's your daily drought reminder;

632
00:52:10.477 --> 00:52:12.138
Only flush for number two.

633
00:52:12.312 --> 00:52:16.772
Austin Ames was crowned prince
of the homecoming dance.

634
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:20.044
Big shocker there.
Didn't see that one coming.

635
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.247
But the real mystery, though,
is who was his princess?

636
00:52:24.424 --> 00:52:28.121
- How Iong are you grounded for?
- Well, how Iong is forever?

637
00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:30.957
- so you're not gonna tell Austin?
- Come on, Carter.

638
00:52:31.131 --> 00:52:36.091
It's not Iike he'II pine for me. Trust me,
he's forgotten all about Cinderella by now.

639
00:52:47.948 --> 00:52:50.678
Yeah, he's obviously forgotten
all about you.

640
00:52:55.989 --> 00:52:59.390
Dude, why are you going through
all this trouble for one chick?

641
00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:03.586
Look, she's not just some chick, all right?
she was real.

642
00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:07.290
- Real. Like, she still had her old nose.
- No, real.

643
00:53:07.467 --> 00:53:10.265
A girl who has more on her mind
than what she wears...

644
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:12.496
or how much weight
she wants to Iose.

645
00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:14.663
- she Iistens to me.
- Listens to you?

646
00:53:14.841 --> 00:53:18.777
hey, brother, I Iisten to you, okay?
I feel your pai—

647
00:53:19.246 --> 00:53:23.546
- Hello, kitty.
- Yeah, you're a great Iistener.

648
00:53:23.717 --> 00:53:26.049
- Well—
- Look, man, you found her cell phone.

649
00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:29.416
- You just gotta get some clue from that.
- The phone's Iocked.

650
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:33.081
I keep getting messages Iike, "I need you,"
and, "Come see me now."

651
00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.252
- Oh, dude, it's so hot.
- see, that's what I thought.

652
00:53:36.897 --> 00:53:42.426
- Until I got one that said, "Come fix fryer."
- Oh, dude, that's hot and kinky, baby.

653
00:53:42.602 --> 00:53:46.561
You know what I'm saying? Can I get one?
Let me get a pound, baby.

654
00:53:47.707 --> 00:53:50.540
He's Iooking for you everywhere.
Tell him it was you.

655
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:53.440
Isn't it better to cling
to what might've been...

656
00:53:53.613 --> 00:53:56.013
instead of ruining everything
with reality?

657
00:53:56.182 --> 00:53:58.776
- You can't hide from him forever.
- Not forever.

658
00:53:58.952 --> 00:54:02.683
Just until graduation, when I Ieave
this place and never see him again.

659
00:54:02.856 --> 00:54:06.690
Okay, so, what about you, Zorro?
When are you gonna tell shelby?

660
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.455
Well, I've been thinking about doing
just that, as a matter of fact.

661
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:15.863
Right. Okay, so the day you tell shelby
it was you, I'II tell Austin it was me.

662
00:54:16.036 --> 00:54:18.470
- Deal.
- Deal.

663
00:54:18.638 --> 00:54:20.799
Look in the yearbook again.

664
00:54:20.974 --> 00:54:27.106
- Maybe she's foreign exchange. That's hot.
- Totally. That's, Iike— That's, Iike, le hot.

665
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.376
Look, there's no way I missed her.
I mean, we had a connection.

666
00:54:39.426 --> 00:54:42.418
- Thanks.
- Jeez, are you okay?

667
00:54:52.272 --> 00:54:55.503
Keep your Iegs straight.
straighter, straighter.

668
00:54:55.675 --> 00:55:01.079
What are you doing? Brianna!
After the flip, it's the butterfly rollover.

669
00:55:01.247 --> 00:55:03.374
- No, it's not. It's mermaid plunge!
- Yes!

670
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:07.145
Oh, my God. I cannot wait
for my solo career!

671
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.652
When are we going solo?

672
00:55:09.823 --> 00:55:14.351
He was so mysterious,
but really obvious at the same time.

673
00:55:14.527 --> 00:55:20.830
I mean, kind of dangerous, but very safe.
And wild, but tame.

674
00:55:21.634 --> 00:55:24.068
I'm gonna go change.

675
00:55:24.371 --> 00:55:27.169
I cannot believe you're gonna tell shelby
it was you.

676
00:55:27.374 --> 00:55:32.539
sam, once she realizes that she's found
her Zorro, okay, she'II be thrilled.

677
00:55:32.712 --> 00:55:37.046
- Now, watch and Iearn.
- Good Iuck.

678
00:55:37.217 --> 00:55:41.153
- And, oh, my God, when I kissed him, I—
- Enough already.

679
00:55:42.055 --> 00:55:46.958
Madison, I think somebody's got a green
monster on their back called Mr. Jealousy.

680
00:55:47.127 --> 00:55:52.690
- shelby, baby, what's up?
- And you are?

681
00:55:54.934 --> 00:56:00.133
Yeah. AIIow me to refresh your memory.

682
00:56:01.708 --> 00:56:06.168
- Zorro.
- You mean zero.

683
00:56:06.379 --> 00:56:08.574
- Who is he?
- That's Carter Farrell.

684
00:56:08.748 --> 00:56:11.080
he's the guy you cheat off
of in AIgebra II.

685
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:13.883
The freak who hums show tunes?

686
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.388
- I'm in front.
- Quit it.

687
00:56:21.561 --> 00:56:22.994
sorry.

688
00:56:23.163 --> 00:56:25.188
- Let me in the front.
- Listen.

689
00:56:25.365 --> 00:56:29.734
Last night I had a very bad cold,
and I drank a whole bottle of NyQuil.

690
00:56:29.903 --> 00:56:35.500
- I just wasn't myself.
- But I thought we had, Iike, a connection.

691
00:56:36.142 --> 00:56:39.737
Okay. We don't have anything.

692
00:56:39.913 --> 00:56:43.872
We are from completely different classes
of human.

693
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:47.019
Let's go back to our usual Iives,
where we only mingle...

694
00:56:47.187 --> 00:56:50.554
when I copy you in AIgebra II, okay?

695
00:56:52.459 --> 00:56:55.519
- "Okay? "
- We didn't rehearse it!

696
00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.926
Was that good?

697
00:57:07.307 --> 00:57:08.535
You all right?

698
00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:12.804
If she thinks she's still cheating off me,
she's crazy.

699
00:57:12.979 --> 00:57:15.243
- Guys, I don't know about this.
- Come on.

700
00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:17.980
- Just trust us.
- We asked every girl...

701
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:21.450
if they were with you at the dance.
These said yes.

702
00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:26.183
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- Austin! Introduce me on the cell phone.

703
00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:29.884
- Guys, come on.
- sit down here.

704
00:57:30.063 --> 00:57:32.930
Okay! Austin Ames!

705
00:57:33.266 --> 00:57:36.861
Let's bring out bachelorette number one!

706
00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:40.767
she's a transfer from Woodland hills,
enjoys collecting puka shells...

707
00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.670
Iong walks on the beach
and getting tubed.

708
00:57:43.843 --> 00:57:45.504
PIeased to meet you, Missy!

709
00:57:46.246 --> 00:57:49.238
- What's up, Austin?
- Thanks for coming, Missy.

710
00:57:50.016 --> 00:57:53.008
- see you, dude.
- You're dead.

711
00:57:53.186 --> 00:57:57.452
Okay, okay, Iet's bring out
bachelorette number two!

712
00:57:57.624 --> 00:58:00.149
This Iittle filly's into barbells...

713
00:58:00.326 --> 00:58:05.423
World War II and protein shakes.
Here's Helga.

714
00:58:05.865 --> 00:58:07.662
Thank you.

715
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:10.526
You are so dead.

716
00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:16.766
- Okay, okay, next up is—
- Enough, enough. Guys, come on.

717
00:58:18.044 --> 00:58:22.777
Look, you're beautiful, okay?
But I'm not your prince.

718
00:58:23.049 --> 00:58:26.883
- You'II meet him someday, but it's not me.
- Thanks, Austin.

719
00:58:27.854 --> 00:58:30.288
- Late entry.
- David, you stop it right now.

720
00:58:30.456 --> 00:58:33.448
You're a bad boy,
and that is a terrible shirt.

721
00:58:34.527 --> 00:58:36.961
Everybody, back to your class.

722
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:38.927
Hi, Ryan.

723
00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:40.928
That's not fair!

724
00:58:46.105 --> 00:58:51.941
Don't want that, don't want that,
don't want that, don't want that.

725
00:59:04.257 --> 00:59:08.421
Accepted? Oh, this won't do.

726
00:59:11.464 --> 00:59:15.332
- hey. Anything in the mail for me?
- Oh, actually...

727
00:59:15.501 --> 00:59:18.902
there's a personalized Ietter here
from Ed McMahon...

728
00:59:19.072 --> 00:59:22.599
saying you just won a million dollars.

729
00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:26.139
Don't spend it all in one place.

730
00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:41.186
I need to know who you are.
I can't take my mind off you.

731
00:59:41.728 --> 00:59:43.719
Please tell me who you are.

732
00:59:49.669 --> 00:59:51.569
Okay.

733
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:57.306
- My name is—
- sam!

734
00:59:57.477 --> 01:00:01.709
- You missed the " Do Not Disturb" sign.
- No, I saw it.

735
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:04.941
so you almost done with my report?
It's due Friday.

736
01:00:05.118 --> 01:00:07.552
- I'm working on it.
- Well, hurry up.

737
01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:10.117
It makes me nervous
to have to wait for it.

738
01:00:10.423 --> 01:00:13.859
Imagine how nervous you'd be
if you actually had to write it.

739
01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:17.255
My God, you're right.

740
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:21.264
so this time, could you try
to make it sound more Iike me?

741
01:00:21.434 --> 01:00:24.835
I'm so sick of having to explain
why I sound so smart on paper...

742
01:00:25.004 --> 01:00:28.235
and so not smart not on paper.

743
01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:32.266
- Sam? Can you come downstairs?
- I'II be right there.

744
01:00:32.578 --> 01:00:34.569
Now!

745
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:40.346
I'II be right back.

746
01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.616
Hurry up.

747
01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:00.637
Who the heck is Nomad?

748
01:01:04.277 --> 01:01:07.804
"Cinderella, are you not talking to me
because you freaked...

749
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.073
when you found out I'm...

750
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.685
Austin Ames? "

751
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.917
sam is Cinderella?

752
01:01:22.427 --> 01:01:25.453
- I got in.
- Austin!

753
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:28.497
- Austin.
- What?

754
01:01:30.735 --> 01:01:32.703
What's going on?

755
01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:34.769
Nothing.

756
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.938
Let me guess. You're thinking,
"Is UsC really the right choice for me? "

757
01:01:40.112 --> 01:01:43.377
Well, yeah. I've been thinking
a Iot about this and—

758
01:01:43.548 --> 01:01:48.952
Don't worry about it. You're making
the right choice, all right?

759
01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:55.187
Okay.

760
01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.592
It's me, Austin. It's Cinderella,
from the dance.

761
01:01:59.764 --> 01:02:03.131
Oh, you found me.

762
01:02:03.668 --> 01:02:05.533
Oh, no.

763
01:02:06.338 --> 01:02:10.138
"You see, Austin, I Iive in this world—"

764
01:02:10.308 --> 01:02:14.472
Full of people pretending
to be something they're not.

765
01:02:14.646 --> 01:02:18.412
- Pretending—
- "I miss you. I don't want—"

766
01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:20.244
I got it.

767
01:02:22.988 --> 01:02:25.582
- how are you doing?
- Good.

768
01:02:28.827 --> 01:02:32.888
- Regular wash?
- No, more Iike the royal treatment.

769
01:02:33.064 --> 01:02:36.500
I mean, that's what Cinderella
would want.

770
01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:39.593
- What did you just say?
- I'm her, Austin.

771
01:02:39.771 --> 01:02:42.763
I'm Cinderella, your dream girl.

772
01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:46.900
- You see, I Iive in a world full of—
- You.

773
01:02:47.078 --> 01:02:49.979
What are you doing here?

774
01:02:50.715 --> 01:02:54.947
I'm Cinderella,
coming to meet my prince.

775
01:02:55.453 --> 01:02:58.513
That's a Iittle hard,
considering I'm Cinderella.

776
01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.818
I mean, I'm the most "Cinderelly"
Cinderella there ever was.

777
01:03:01.993 --> 01:03:05.053
Ladies, Iadies, Iadies.
Look, I can settle this, all right?

778
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.564
The girl that I met at the dance,
she dropped something on her way out.

779
01:03:10.368 --> 01:03:13.701
- What was it?
- Oh, that's easy.

780
01:03:13.872 --> 01:03:16.204
- A wallet.
- No.

781
01:03:16.775 --> 01:03:22.407
- I meant a wallet-purse.
- No.

782
01:03:22.681 --> 01:03:24.672
A fish.

783
01:03:25.383 --> 01:03:27.442
- A fish?
- It was the first thing...

784
01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:31.111
that popped into my head.
You said, "wallet-purse." What's that?

785
01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:34.315
- Austin?
- Well.

786
01:03:36.027 --> 01:03:38.791
Look what you did. See?
You always ruin everything.

787
01:03:38.964 --> 01:03:41.592
I was supposed to be Cinderella.
I'm the oldest.

788
01:03:41.766 --> 01:03:47.932
By a minute and 26 seconds.
And you never Iet me forget it!

789
01:03:51.543 --> 01:03:54.842
- Well, maybe this will help you remember.
- No.

790
01:03:55.013 --> 01:03:56.640
Come here!

791
01:03:57.682 --> 01:04:01.174
You're dead. I'm gonna kill you!

792
01:04:05.924 --> 01:04:07.653
Bri?

793
01:04:11.696 --> 01:04:14.665
Oh, I'm gonna kill you! Get off!

794
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:21.966
- That's what you get for stealing my idea!
- hey, Dad, isn't that our car?

795
01:04:22.474 --> 01:04:25.136
- I hate you!
- I hate you!

796
01:04:35.987 --> 01:04:38.012
- Oh, no!
- Not the—

797
01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:39.884
- Hot wax!
- Hot wax!

798
01:05:11.723 --> 01:05:13.918
Thank you. Have a good night.

799
01:05:17.228 --> 01:05:20.026
- Bobby, can I get two BLT's?
- It's coming.

800
01:05:21.933 --> 01:05:23.662
That's him.

801
01:05:23.868 --> 01:05:28.237
- That's good. Go over.
- No.

802
01:05:40.118 --> 01:05:41.915
Hey.

803
01:05:42.387 --> 01:05:44.355
Can I get you something?

804
01:05:45.824 --> 01:05:47.849
Do you know what bugs me?

805
01:05:49.127 --> 01:05:52.756
- People taking your order?
- No.

806
01:05:52.931 --> 01:05:55.092
Taking people's orders.

807
01:05:55.266 --> 01:05:59.862
- Why would you do that?
- You don't know my dad.

808
01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:04.907
sushi and doughnuts? Who does that?

809
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:09.969
- I'II take a coffee. Thank you.
- Excuse me, miss?

810
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.949
Do you ever feel Iike if you show
someone who you really are...

811
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:17.918
they won't accept you?

812
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.252
Yeah. I do.

813
01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.318
Like being yourself isn't good enough.

814
01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:29.491
- Right.
- Like you're wearing a mask.

815
01:06:30.969 --> 01:06:32.402
That's exactly how I feel.

816
01:06:34.506 --> 01:06:38.306
You just wanna be honest with this person
and tell them, "It's me.

817
01:06:39.077 --> 01:06:41.511
I'm the one that you've
been Iooking for."

818
01:06:41.679 --> 01:06:43.613
Yeah.

819
01:06:44.582 --> 01:06:46.447
Austin...

820
01:06:48.019 --> 01:06:49.486
- ... I'm—
- sam!

821
01:06:51.189 --> 01:06:53.180
- One second.
- No, now.

822
01:06:55.627 --> 01:06:57.959
No, it's cool, I gotta bounce.

823
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.824
Oh, great, thank you so much.

824
01:07:06.638 --> 01:07:08.936
Thank you very much, sam.

825
01:07:11.943 --> 01:07:13.467
You're welcome.

826
01:07:13.645 --> 01:07:17.012
Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.
Here's your daily drought reminder;

827
01:07:17.182 --> 01:07:21.118
Don 't hose your lawn, your car,
or anybody else, for that matter.

828
01:07:21.419 --> 01:07:24.183
And remember, tickets
for the big game go on sale...

829
01:07:24.355 --> 01:07:29.884
And then she told us that she was
going to try to steal...

830
01:07:30.061 --> 01:07:33.189
Austin away from you
if that was the Iast thing she did.

831
01:07:34.165 --> 01:07:37.965
Our stepsister has always been
jealous of you.

832
01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:41.633
Go on.

833
01:07:41.806 --> 01:07:45.503
Well, that's when she invented
this whole Cinderella plot.

834
01:07:45.944 --> 01:07:48.208
she got ahold of Austin's
e-mail address...

835
01:07:48.379 --> 01:07:51.177
and that's when she
started the whole affair.

836
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:55.809
We wanted to tell you sooner,
but she threatened to kill us.

837
01:07:55.987 --> 01:07:58.319
she's such a monster.

838
01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:03.318
Look, if you don't believe us,
Iook at the e-mails.

839
01:08:03.728 --> 01:08:08.495
she goes by Princeton Girl 818,
but her real name is sam Montgomery.

840
01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.528
And we're Brianna and Gabriella.

841
01:08:14.038 --> 01:08:18.668
so that Iittle boyfriend stealer
thinks she can pull a fast one on me?

842
01:08:19.077 --> 01:08:22.103
Well, we'II just see about that.

843
01:08:29.988 --> 01:08:34.049
Austin was really Iate today and asked me
if you'd read this announcement.

844
01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:39.625
"Cinderella...

845
01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:45.336
if you're listening, your prince wants to
rendezvous with you after the pep rally. "

846
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:49.237
Nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince.

847
01:09:00.018 --> 01:09:03.385
Carter! I talked to him.
And not as Cinderella.

848
01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:06.752
I talked to him as me, sam,
and he didn't hate me.

849
01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.893
so you told him everything?

850
01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.154
No, not everything. Not the part
about me being Cinderella.

851
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:16.266
But I'm gonna go tell him right after
the pep rally. You coming, cowboy?

852
01:09:17.201 --> 01:09:20.398
- so you think I Iook Iike a real cowboy?
- sure.

853
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.835
- Who we gonna beat?
- The Lancers!

854
01:09:53.004 --> 01:09:55.131
- And when we gonna beat them?
- Friday!

855
01:09:55.306 --> 01:09:58.002
Good news. I just got off
the phone with hank Cole.

856
01:09:58.176 --> 01:10:02.112
You play well on Friday, and your future
is set at UsC football.

857
01:10:03.514 --> 01:10:05.141
That's great, Dad.

858
01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:08.615
And who's gonna Iead us to victory?

859
01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:11.220
- Austin!
- I can't hear you!

860
01:10:11.389 --> 01:10:13.721
- Kill the Lancers!
- Austin!

861
01:10:18.062 --> 01:10:21.896
The cheerleaders have put together
a skit to help get us in the spirit.

862
01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:27.097
I Iove you, shelby!

863
01:10:27.271 --> 01:10:28.602
Thank you.

864
01:10:29.073 --> 01:10:33.373
"Once upon a time, there was
a big, strong Fighting Frog.

865
01:10:34.145 --> 01:10:39.139
he had a beautiful girlfriend, and his dad
owned the biggest pond in all the Iand.

866
01:10:40.151 --> 01:10:42.142
But he still wasn't happy.

867
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:48.352
If only he can find a princess,
then she could kiss him...

868
01:10:48.526 --> 01:10:52.428
turn him into a prince,
and they would run away together.

869
01:10:56.234 --> 01:11:00.364
One night, after the slimy frog
ditches his super-hot...

870
01:11:00.538 --> 01:11:04.235
senior-poll-most-popular girlfriend,
he meets his princess."

871
01:11:04.409 --> 01:11:05.876
Your highness.

872
01:11:08.713 --> 01:11:12.547
"AIas, it turned out that our frog
not only had a secret identity...

873
01:11:12.717 --> 01:11:18.417
but also had a secret e-mail relationship
with a pen pal named Princeton Girl."

874
01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:20.554
This isn't good.

875
01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:24.058
Dear Princeton Girl, I can't wait
till we finally get to meet.

876
01:11:24.228 --> 01:11:26.719
You're the only one
who understands the real me.

877
01:11:26.898 --> 01:11:29.298
The man who doesn't want
to play UsC football.

878
01:11:29.467 --> 01:11:32.732
But who wants to be at Princeton,
with you.

879
01:11:33.104 --> 01:11:36.540
- What are they talking about?
- Nothing.

880
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:41.611
Dear Nomad, I want you to know
who I am, but I'm scared!

881
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.675
I'm scared that you'II reject me.

882
01:11:44.849 --> 01:11:49.047
And I've never had a real kiss before.

883
01:11:50.388 --> 01:11:53.255
- I can't believe they're reading my e-mails.
- Let's go.

884
01:11:53.424 --> 01:11:55.221
But our princess had a secret too.

885
01:11:55.393 --> 01:12:01.127
she wasn't royalty at all, but a geek,
a Ioser, a servant girl.

886
01:12:06.771 --> 01:12:08.261
Yeah!

887
01:12:08.573 --> 01:12:10.666
Any ideas about this?

888
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:15.773
And who, may you ask, is this imposter?

889
01:12:15.947 --> 01:12:21.783
Give it up for the pretend princess,
diner girl, sam Montgomery!

890
01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:32.653
Diner girl! Diner girl!
Diner girl! Diner girl!

891
01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:41.371
Come on.

892
01:13:03.427 --> 01:13:06.555
- sam!
- Go away!

893
01:13:07.265 --> 01:13:11.361
But, sam, you've got a Ietter
from Princeton.

894
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:20.506
What does it say?

895
01:13:27.752 --> 01:13:29.014
I didn't get in.

896
01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:33.390
Oh, no!

897
01:13:35.159 --> 01:13:36.990
And you studied so hard.

898
01:13:37.361 --> 01:13:39.955
I can't believe I actually thought
I had a chance.

899
01:13:40.131 --> 01:13:43.066
sam, I'm heartbroken.

900
01:13:43.434 --> 01:13:46.494
Life can be so unfair.

901
01:13:47.505 --> 01:13:49.769
Well, just Iook at the bright side.

902
01:13:50.308 --> 01:13:53.869
You have a job at the diner
for the rest of your Iife.

903
01:13:56.714 --> 01:13:58.739
You want a cookie?

904
01:14:02.854 --> 01:14:04.583
They're so moist.

905
01:15:16.861 --> 01:15:20.126
People Iike her don't belong
in our world, Austin.

906
01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:04.807
sam, what are you doing?

907
01:16:05.676 --> 01:16:08.201
I'm trying to get these floors clean.

908
01:16:10.081 --> 01:16:12.242
Come on, sweetie, get up.

909
01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:15.812
What I meant is, what are you
doing with your Iife?

910
01:16:16.153 --> 01:16:19.486
I'm diner girl. I'm doing what
diner girls do, Rhonda.

911
01:16:20.224 --> 01:16:24.593
Baby, what's gotten into you? You don't
even realize how blessed you are.

912
01:16:24.762 --> 01:16:28.630
Look, you've got a whole family
behind you.

913
01:16:30.201 --> 01:16:32.032
We have faith in you.

914
01:16:32.203 --> 01:16:34.171
And you gotta have faith in yourself.

915
01:16:55.793 --> 01:16:57.192
Mother!

916
01:16:57.361 --> 01:17:00.694
- sam just ruined your wall.
- What?

917
01:17:00.865 --> 01:17:05.063
Yes, you did. Well, that's gonna come
out of your paycheck.

918
01:17:06.971 --> 01:17:09.462
And cover up those stupid words.

919
01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:14.707
" Never Iet the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game."

920
01:17:15.946 --> 01:17:19.780
AII right. I'm going off to
get some more Iipo.

921
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:23.386
Come on, girls. Sam, I need you
to clean the pool tonight.

922
01:17:23.788 --> 01:17:25.619
No.

923
01:17:30.728 --> 01:17:32.423
Excuse me?

924
01:17:32.596 --> 01:17:35.793
You heard me. I quit.

925
01:17:35.966 --> 01:17:40.630
I quit this job. I quit your family.
And I'm moving out.

926
01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:47.969
Oh, and where are you gonna Iive?

927
01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:50.008
With me.

928
01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:54.710
You can't just walk out on me.

929
01:17:54.985 --> 01:17:56.213
You know what, Fiona?

930
01:17:56.387 --> 01:17:59.254
You can mess with your hair,
your nose and your face...

931
01:17:59.423 --> 01:18:01.755
and you can even mess
with my dad's diner.

932
01:18:02.126 --> 01:18:04.321
But you're through messing with me.

933
01:18:05.796 --> 01:18:07.127
Wait up, Sam.

934
01:18:07.298 --> 01:18:11.200
You take one more step, and you're fired.

935
01:18:11.368 --> 01:18:15.168
Oh, no, that won't be necessary,
because I quit too. And you know what?

936
01:18:15.339 --> 01:18:20.504
The only reason why I put up with
you all these years is because of that girl.

937
01:18:20.878 --> 01:18:24.837
Now that she's free of you, nothing
is stopping me from kicking your butt.

938
01:18:25.182 --> 01:18:29.118
Come on, no. Not my face. It's much
newer than the girls. Go for the girls!

939
01:18:29.286 --> 01:18:32.187
- Mom!
- Rhonda? Rhonda!

940
01:18:32.356 --> 01:18:34.381
she's not even worth it.

941
01:18:37.595 --> 01:18:40.189
- You're right.
- You know what? I quit too.

942
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:44.231
Me too. Hey, Rhonda. EIeanor.
Hold up, I need a ride.

943
01:18:44.668 --> 01:18:46.295
see you.

944
01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:49.729
Well...

945
01:18:50.741 --> 01:18:52.299
see you.

946
01:18:54.778 --> 01:18:56.643
send me a bill.

947
01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:02.808
Fiona actually thought
you were gonna slug her.

948
01:19:02.987 --> 01:19:04.852
I was gonna do more than that.

949
01:19:05.022 --> 01:19:07.456
I had no idea that you were that tough.

950
01:19:08.425 --> 01:19:10.916
Yeah, but I always knew that you were.

951
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:14.320
Rhonda...

952
01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:18.562
are you sure that this is okay?

953
01:19:18.736 --> 01:19:21.762
sam, I wouldn't have it any other way.

954
01:19:27.945 --> 01:19:30.937
I haven't felt this much at home
in such a Iong time.

955
01:19:31.348 --> 01:19:33.839
I'm sure, compared
to the Addams Family.

956
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:40.752
- What's on your mind?
- I gotta do something tonight.

957
01:19:40.925 --> 01:19:43.257
Don't wait up for me, okay?

958
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:48.960
Welcome to the start of tonight's game
between the South Bay Lancers...

959
01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:51.363
and the North Valley Fighting Frogs!

960
01:19:55.039 --> 01:20:00.500
Big welcome to all returning alumni to
tonight's 38th annual homecoming game!

961
01:20:04.281 --> 01:20:06.749
- Check it!
- Chick at 3 o'clock!

962
01:20:08.052 --> 01:20:11.510
- hey, diner girl!
- What's she doing in here?

963
01:20:18.295 --> 01:20:20.092
What are you doing in here?

964
01:20:20.297 --> 01:20:21.958
sam.

965
01:20:22.399 --> 01:20:25.266
- Okay, I know you think I'm just some—
- Coward? Phony?

966
01:20:25.436 --> 01:20:27.802
- Okay, just Iisten.
- No, you Iisten.

967
01:20:28.005 --> 01:20:30.803
You turned out to be exactly
who I thought you were.

968
01:20:30.975 --> 01:20:34.342
I never pretended to be somebody else.
It's been me all along.

969
01:20:34.511 --> 01:20:37.503
And it was me who was hurt
in front of everybody.

970
01:20:38.315 --> 01:20:42.308
Look, I didn't come here
to yell at you, okay?

971
01:20:42.486 --> 01:20:46.718
I came to tell you I know what it feels
Iike to be afraid to show who you are.

972
01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.687
I was. But I'm not anymore.

973
01:20:48.859 --> 01:20:51.987
And the thing is, I don't care
what people think about me...

974
01:20:52.162 --> 01:20:56.189
because I believe in myself.
And I know that things are gonna be okay.

975
01:20:56.367 --> 01:21:00.531
But even though I have no family
and no job and no money for college...

976
01:21:00.704 --> 01:21:03.036
it's you that I feel sorry for.

977
01:21:03.607 --> 01:21:07.043
- Heads up. Yo, five minutes.
- I'm coming.

978
01:21:08.412 --> 01:21:12.508
I know that guy that sent those e-mails
is somewhere down inside of you.

979
01:21:12.683 --> 01:21:14.913
But I can't wait for him...

980
01:21:15.219 --> 01:21:18.848
because waiting for you is Iike
waiting for rain in this drought.

981
01:21:19.023 --> 01:21:21.457
Useless and disappointing.

982
01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:26.991
sam.

983
01:21:38.942 --> 01:21:41.069
- sam.
- hey. What are you doing here?

984
01:21:41.245 --> 01:21:45.841
Rhonda told me where you might be. I
thought you could use a friend. Come here.

985
01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:51.018
sam, I'm so proud of you.
You did—

986
01:21:51.188 --> 01:21:54.783
Your stepmom and Austin,
all in one day. How do you feel?

987
01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:58.894
I'II Iet you know when I can catch
my breath. Let's do something tonight.

988
01:21:59.063 --> 01:22:03.625
Well, I was actually thinking
about going to the game...

989
01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:06.361
but I understand
if you don't wanna do that.

990
01:22:07.204 --> 01:22:08.694
No, I'II go.

991
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.365
Really? You'II go to the game?

992
01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:15.276
Yeah. I can handle it now.
It'II be our first and Iast.

993
01:22:15.446 --> 01:22:19.212
And besides, if I don't go, who else
is gonna explain the game to you?

994
01:22:21.752 --> 01:22:25.085
I Iike what you're wearing.
What character are you today?

995
01:22:25.255 --> 01:22:28.554
- Myself.
- I think it's your best Iook.

996
01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:30.125
Thank you.

997
01:22:31.562 --> 01:22:34.861
Come on, everybody. Weren 't they great?
Let's hear it for them.

998
01:22:35.032 --> 01:22:38.695
Let's give our cheerleaders a big hand.
Make some noise.

999
01:22:38.869 --> 01:22:43.897
Austin and I are almost back together.
It isn't official or anything, but it's on.

1000
01:22:44.074 --> 01:22:45.473
- sorry, guys.
- sorry.

1001
01:22:45.642 --> 01:22:49.874
Okay, everybody. Get ready.
Here they come!

1002
01:22:50.047 --> 01:22:51.309
I'm glad you came, Sam.

1003
01:22:51.482 --> 01:22:57.114
The defending regional conference
champions, your very own Fighting Frogs!

1004
01:23:08.165 --> 01:23:10.690
Both the Lancers and the Frogs
enter the game...

1005
01:23:10.868 --> 01:23:13.393
tied for the lead in the
conference standings.

1006
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:18.769
The winner of tonight's game will advance
to the playoffs for the state championship.

1007
01:23:20.577 --> 01:23:22.101
Austin.

1008
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.413
Austin. AII right, buddy.
This is the big one, all right?

1009
01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:28.847
You stay focused and win it.

1010
01:23:29.019 --> 01:23:31.487
- Everyone is counting on you. AII right?
- Andy!

1011
01:23:31.655 --> 01:23:34.419
hey, Chuck! how you doing, pal?

1012
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.820
Let's do it again! One more time.

1013
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.720
Down, set, 28 guarding, 28 guarding!

1014
01:24:08.992 --> 01:24:10.653
Hike!

1015
01:24:16.266 --> 01:24:19.201
The clock is stopped with nine seconds
left in the game.

1016
01:24:19.369 --> 01:24:24.068
- The Frogs need one touchdown to win.
- I Iove football! I Iove football!

1017
01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:27.469
I Iove football!

1018
01:24:29.313 --> 01:24:34.580
Austin! Austin! Austin!
Austin! Austin!

1019
01:24:45.796 --> 01:24:50.995
Carter, I thought that I could handle this,
but I really can't. I'm gonna go.

1020
01:24:57.274 --> 01:25:00.801
You know what? I'II tell you
how it ends, okay?

1021
01:25:02.646 --> 01:25:04.841
- Come on!
- Do it, baby!

1022
01:25:16.994 --> 01:25:20.657
This is the one. This is the one, Austin.
This is the one.

1023
01:25:29.406 --> 01:25:32.637
- sorry, boys.
- Where are you going?

1024
01:25:33.243 --> 01:25:34.608
What's he—? What is he—?

1025
01:25:39.283 --> 01:25:40.545
What's the problem?

1026
01:25:40.951 --> 01:25:42.919
- What are you doing?
- I'm out of here.

1027
01:25:43.487 --> 01:25:46.320
What? You're throwing away your dream!

1028
01:25:46.757 --> 01:25:49.248
No, Dad. I'm throwing away yours.

1029
01:25:51.662 --> 01:25:54.062
It's your game now. Go get them.

1030
01:25:57.935 --> 01:26:01.632
Substituting for Ames is number 23,
Ryan Henson.

1031
01:26:01.972 --> 01:26:04.964
- Austin!
- Austin! Get back here!

1032
01:26:16.453 --> 01:26:18.751
Austin, what are you doing?

1033
01:26:19.423 --> 01:26:21.653
something I should've done
a Iong time ago.

1034
01:26:51.054 --> 01:26:53.249
sorry I waited for the rain.

1035
01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:55.248
It's okay.

1036
01:26:58.595 --> 01:26:59.857
No!

1037
01:27:01.465 --> 01:27:03.365
Oh, my God.

1038
01:27:18.615 --> 01:27:23.075
Touchdown! The Fighting Frogs have won.
They've done it. They won the game.

1039
01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:27.584
Oh, my... You gotta
Iove high school.

1040
01:27:38.535 --> 01:27:40.264
So we won the big game that day.

1041
01:27:40.437 --> 01:27:42.997
But what I remember most
was I got my prince.

1042
01:27:43.173 --> 01:27:45.164
And a really bad cold.

1043
01:27:46.943 --> 01:27:50.344
After that, it was like everything
fell into place.

1044
01:28:05.395 --> 01:28:09.695
My dad was right. The fairy tale book
did contain something important.

1045
01:28:15.472 --> 01:28:18.100
Take this one and take the
two cars in the front.

1046
01:28:18.275 --> 01:28:20.937
I can pay for those parking tickets!

1047
01:28:22.112 --> 01:28:25.570
Actually, I'm selling your cars, Fiona.
For college tuition money.

1048
01:28:26.316 --> 01:28:29.114
What gives you the idea
you can sell our cars?

1049
01:28:29.319 --> 01:28:32.720
- she owns them.
- Exactly. I own them.

1050
01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:36.757
I'm the county district attorney.
have you ever seen this before?

1051
01:28:36.927 --> 01:28:39.225
I've never seen that before.

1052
01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:43.026
Isn't this your signature
on the witness Iine?

1053
01:28:44.134 --> 01:28:47.501
I have never seen my
husband's hidden will before.

1054
01:28:49.106 --> 01:28:52.337
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come
downtown with me, ma'am.

1055
01:28:54.911 --> 01:29:00.349
That hidden will stated that the house,
the diner and everything belonged to me.

1056
01:29:01.752 --> 01:29:06.451
It turned out my stepsisters knew where
Fiona had filed my real acceptance letter.

1057
01:29:06.623 --> 01:29:08.147
I got it!

1058
01:29:10.527 --> 01:29:13.724
My dad's diner was restored
to its former glory.

1059
01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.830
And my stepmother
made a deal with the DA.

1060
01:29:19.002 --> 01:29:22.494
She's working off her debt
to society at Hal's...

1061
01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.141
under the watchful eye
of my new partner.

1062
01:29:34.117 --> 01:29:38.554
And my stepsisters? They finally put
their teamwork to good use.

1063
01:29:44.394 --> 01:29:49.127
Austin 's dad finally came around
and got off his Trojan horse.

1064
01:29:51.234 --> 01:29:53.498
Things even cleared up for Carter.

1065
01:29:56.506 --> 01:30:00.169
Anything is possible if you just believe.

1066
01:30:00.677 --> 01:30:03.077
He ended up filming a commercial.

1067
01:30:04.214 --> 01:30:06.910
And in addition to
landing that commercial...

1068
01:30:07.918 --> 01:30:10.318
Carter also landed the girl.

1069
01:30:18.428 --> 01:30:21.420
The San Fernando Valley
was clear and beautiful...

1070
01:30:21.598 --> 01:30:24.260
the way it only is after a big rainstorm.

1071
01:30:26.937 --> 01:30:30.737
As for Austin and me, well,
I finally got my cell phone back.

1072
01:30:30.907 --> 01:30:35.037
We wound up going to Princeton together
and lived happily ever after.

1073
01:30:36.446 --> 01:30:39.882
A t least for now.
Hey, I'm only a freshman.

1074
01:35:03.046 --> 01:35:05.037
[END]
