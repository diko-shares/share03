1
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.866
First time giving blood?

2
00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:56.802
Yes.

3
00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:00.572
They pay cash here.

4
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.041
And there is no limit
to how many times you give.

5
00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:04.944
They even buy it in the jar.

6
00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.327
Jared Nomak,

7
00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.415
we're ready for you.

8
00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:24.188
In the past 12 months,

9
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.516
have you gotten a tattoo,
or undergone any ear,

10
00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.218
skin or body piercings?
No.

11
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.870
Where did you get that
scar on your chin?

12
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:34.841
Childhood accident.

13
00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.076
You say you don't have any immediate
next of kin, is that right?

14
00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:40.672
Not that I'm in contact with.

15
00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.115
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

16
00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:44.584
No one.

17
00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.252
No family?

18
00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.682
I told you, no.

19
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:49.230
Are you telling me...

20
00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:50.832
I can't be a donor?

21
00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:53.517
It depends. We came up,

22
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.019
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

23
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.599
What?

24
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.900
How?

25
00:01:58.766 --> 00:01:59.766
How unusual?

26
00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:03.335
Let me explain.

27
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.171
Your blood has a very rare phenotype,

28
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.940
one we haven't encountered before.

29
00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:12.057
What?

30
00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.159
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.151
Who are you?

32
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.253
No.

33
00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:18.543
Sit down, please.

34
00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:22.654
What is this?

35
00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:26.160
This is a good news
bad news scenario, Jared.

36
00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:28.428
Good news for us...

37
00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:32.398
Bad news...

38
00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:36.235
for you.

<font color=#ff8000><i>He taught me how

52
00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:23.275
<font color=#ff8000><i>Taught me the rules.</i></font>

53
00:04:24.377 --> 00:04:25.571
<font color=#ff8000><i>Gave me the weapons,</i></font>

00:04:25.873 --> 00:04:26.973

59
00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:36.556
<font color=#ff8000><i>They took him,</i></font>

60
00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:39.923
<font color=#ff8000><i>and turned him into
the thing I hate most.</i></font>

61
00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:43.995
<font color=#ff8000><i>I should have finished him off.</i></font>

62
00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:46.565
<font color=#ff8000><i>Now I'm hunting him.</i></font>

63
00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:51.704
<font color=#ff8000><i>I will find him.</i></font>

64
00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:55.006
<font color=#ff8000><i>And nothing will stand in my way.</i></font>

65
00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:20.432
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

66
00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:35.948
Where is he?

67
00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:22.194
Hey!

68
00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:16.208
No, no.

69
00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:23.415
Take me to him,

70
00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:25.784
and I'll consider you a loose end.

71
00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:50.095
Catch you later.

72
00:11:28.568 --> 00:11:29.668
Old man.

73
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.170
Look at what they've done to you.

74
00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:28.226
Let's go home.

75
00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.049
♪ <i>Lock up your daughters, ♪
♪ boys and girls,</i> ♪

76
00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:19.751
♪ <i>The dark knight returns.</i> ♪

77
00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:26.752
Need a toke of the smokage, B?

78
00:13:27.312 --> 00:13:28.253
Later.

79
00:13:28.354 --> 00:13:29.754
Cut the lights.

80
00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:37.329
You found him.

81
00:13:43.403 --> 00:13:44.503
You didn't kill him.

82
00:13:46.573 --> 00:13:47.673
Give me a hand.

83
00:13:51.077 --> 00:13:52.677
I got a bad feeling about this, B.

84
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.015
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying.

85
00:13:57.283 --> 00:13:59.883
He's in pain, why don't you put
him out of his misery right now?

86
00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:02.487
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

87
00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:05.588
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

88
00:14:06.692 --> 00:14:07.992
Like a heroin addict.

89
00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:11.730
Make him go coldturkey in one night.

90
00:14:11.797 --> 00:14:12.934
Shit ain't going to work, man.

91
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.736
I say you kill the motherfucker right now.

92
00:14:16.068 --> 00:14:17.168
Get out.

93
00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:29.446
If there is anything left of you
in there Whistler?

94
00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:31.216
Listen up.

95
00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:35.319
In the morning those blinds
are going to open.

96
00:14:37.223 --> 00:14:38.823
Whether you're cured...

97
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:39.891
or not.

98
00:14:52.738 --> 00:14:53.938
Hey, man, I didn't mean to call him...

99
00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:34.879
<i>Listen to me, Blade.</i>

100
00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:39.783
<i>You're going to have to finish me off.</i>

101
00:15:40.119 --> 00:15:41.019
<i>No.</i>

102
00:15:42.222 --> 00:15:44.122
<i>Give me that damn gun.</i>

103
00:15:51.064 --> 00:15:52.598
<i>Now walk away.</i>

104
00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:54.966
<i>Stubborn son of a bitch.</i>

105
00:16:47.353 --> 00:16:48.553
How do you feel?

106
00:16:54.894 --> 00:16:56.494
Like hammered shit.

107
00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:01.266
How'd you find me?

108
00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:04.335
I started out in Moscow.

109
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:06.071
Then Romania.

110
00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:08.762
They kept moving you around.

111
00:17:08.764 --> 00:17:09.964
How long was I gone?

112
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.979
Months?

113
00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:16.981
Too long.

114
00:17:24.324 --> 00:17:25.324
Years.

115
00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:30.863
They tortured me almost to death.

116
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.730
And then let me heal in a vat of blood

117
00:17:34.366 --> 00:17:35.966
so they could go at it again.

118
00:17:39.371 --> 00:17:41.325
Sorry sons of bitches,
could have at least fixed

119
00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:43.327
my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

120
00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:48.479
Where's my arc welder?

121
00:18:04.796 --> 00:18:06.096
What's up?
Nice to meet you, man.

122
00:18:06.297 --> 00:18:07.297
I heard a lot about you.

123
00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:09.133
I'm Josh.
You can call me Scud.

124
00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:10.435
Everybody does.

125
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:23.881
Tell me something, Skid...

126
00:18:24.817 --> 00:18:25.911
no man Scud,

127
00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:27.213
it's Scud, like Stud.

128
00:18:27.214 --> 00:18:28.614
Scud.
Whatever.

129
00:18:29.188 --> 00:18:30.309
What are you doing here?

130
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:31.623
The pimpmobile?

131
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.490
Just a little aftermarket modification.

132
00:18:33.626 --> 00:18:35.626
Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
Oh, yeah.

133
00:18:36.062 --> 00:18:38.812
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

134
00:18:39.131 --> 00:18:41.319
Yeah. The whole package will
crank that Betty up maybe,

135
00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:42.121
300 horsepower.

136
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.922
You'll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

137
00:18:45.537 --> 00:18:48.037
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

138
00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:49.874
What the fuck is your problem, poppy?

139
00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:53.311
My problem is I've been sucking
blood clots for two years.

140
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.679
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

141
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.484
And we jeopardized our whole
operation to save your fucking ass!

142
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:00.551
Our operation?
Yeah.

143
00:19:00.887 --> 00:19:02.087
Our operation?

144
00:19:02.155 --> 00:19:04.355
I built this operation you ass-wipe!

145
00:19:08.327 --> 00:19:09.472
Motion sensors!

146
00:19:09.474 --> 00:19:10.596
It's on three, gentlemen.

147
00:19:10.662 --> 00:19:11.662
Human?

148
00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:16.233
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

149
00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:24.193
Fried.

150
00:19:24.195 --> 00:19:25.995
They're using magnesium flares.

151
00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:28.845
They've got your security
system scoped out.

152
00:19:32.617 --> 00:19:33.717
I don't trust you...

153
00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:20.766
Cool outfit.

154
00:20:29.008 --> 00:20:30.008
Guard lights!

155
00:22:28.527 --> 00:22:30.627
We represent the ruling body
of the vampire nation.

156
00:22:32.465 --> 00:22:34.065
They're offering you a truce.

157
00:22:35.734 --> 00:22:37.034
They want to meet with you.

158
00:22:40.906 --> 00:22:41.906
Scud.

159
00:22:45.744 --> 00:22:46.944
Take off your mask.

160
00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:53.951
My name is Asad.

161
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.320
This is Nyssa.

162
00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:01.892
You have been our most feared enemy.

163
00:23:02.694 --> 00:23:04.994
But now there is something else
loose on the streets.

164
00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:08.399
Something worse than you.

165
00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:24.715
What's so funny?

166
00:23:25.717 --> 00:23:28.417
They tell stories about Blade
as the bogeyman.

167
00:23:29.488 --> 00:23:30.888
Frankly, I'm disappointed.

168
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.890
You hear that, B?

169
00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:35.259
She's disappointed.

170
00:23:35.727 --> 00:23:37.527
He agreed to come along so easily.

171
00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:40.665
Come on, B, show her.

172
00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:42.433
Come on, pretty please?

173
00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:47.638
Semtex.

174
00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:51.075
Enough explosives to level
a city block.

175
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.580
You still disappointed?

176
00:24:18.104 --> 00:24:19.614
The guards look human, B?

177
00:24:20.016 --> 00:24:21.216
They're probably familiars.

178
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:41.091
You sure about this?

179
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.260
Well, if I'm not...

180
00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:58.674
The true power of
the vampire nation lies here.

181
00:25:11.022 --> 00:25:12.222
Father?

182
00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:23.565
Blade, this is Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

183
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.609
It has been said, be proud
of your enemy and,

184
00:25:31.677 --> 00:25:33.677
enjoy his success.

185
00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:36.179
In that regard, I should thank you.

186
00:25:36.315 --> 00:25:37.415
For what?

187
00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:39.449
Eliminating Deacon Frost.

188
00:25:39.885 --> 00:25:41.085
You did us a favor.

189
00:25:41.287 --> 00:25:42.387
Karel Kounen.

190
00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:46.563
You're human.

191
00:25:46.565 --> 00:25:47.825
Barely. I'm a lawyer.

192
00:25:48.527 --> 00:25:50.227
European health consortium.

193
00:25:50.228 --> 00:25:51.606
As you may know,

194
00:25:51.808 --> 00:25:53.508
vampirism is...

195
00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:55.565
A horrible virus,

196
00:25:56.234 --> 00:25:58.634
carried in the saliva of predators.

197
00:25:59.237 --> 00:26:00.737
In 72 hours,

198
00:26:00.738 --> 00:26:03.038
it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

199
00:26:03.809 --> 00:26:06.578
creating new parasitic organs.

200
00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:08.145
Like cancer.

201
00:26:10.249 --> 00:26:11.265
Cancer...

202
00:26:12.367 --> 00:26:13.667
with a purpose.

203
00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:17.553
Unfortunately, viruses evolve, too.

204
00:26:18.023 --> 00:26:19.623
We've encountered a new one.

205
00:26:20.192 --> 00:26:21.792
We dubbed it the reaper strain.

206
00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:24.127
And like any good pathogen,

207
00:26:24.163 --> 00:26:26.163
it appears to have found a carrier.

208
00:26:34.673 --> 00:26:36.073
There, Jared Nomak.

209
00:26:37.042 --> 00:26:38.622
Born a vampire,

210
00:26:38.624 --> 00:26:40.246
but an anomaly like you.

211
00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:44.082
Unlike the rest of us, however,

212
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.950
he feeds on not just humans,

213
00:26:47.586 --> 00:26:50.086
but vampires as well.

214
00:26:50.087 --> 00:26:51.734
Looks like he was doing me a favor.

215
00:26:51.736 --> 00:26:53.036
You're missing the point.

216
00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.844
Their vampire victims don't die...

217
00:26:57.846 --> 00:26:58.946
they turn.

218
00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:00.138
They become carriers.

219
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.640
You've got to understand.

220
00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:03.434
These things are like crack addicts.

221
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:05.269
They need to feed daily.

222
00:27:06.004 --> 00:27:08.104
Nomak's been up for 72 hours.

223
00:27:08.507 --> 00:27:11.607
By our estimates, there are
already a dozen reapers.

224
00:27:12.344 --> 00:27:14.144
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

225
00:27:14.213 --> 00:27:16.113
Thousands within a matter of months.

226
00:27:17.182 --> 00:27:18.282
Do the math.

227
00:27:19.017 --> 00:27:20.317
Wait. Let me get this right.

228
00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:22.919
You want me to hunt them,

229
00:27:23.371 --> 00:27:24.371
for you?

230
00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:26.156
When they are finished with us,

231
00:27:26.492 --> 00:27:28.592
who do you think they'll turn on next?

232
00:27:30.028 --> 00:27:32.228
Your precious humans.

233
00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:35.098
Not one of them will be left.

234
00:27:36.702 --> 00:27:39.302
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit,

235
00:27:39.538 --> 00:27:40.547
the bloodpack.

236
00:27:40.849 --> 00:27:42.149
We want you to lead them.

237
00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:43.907
Two years?

238
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:47.311
We've been training to hunt you.

239
00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:52.767
So, B-man, what do you think?

240
00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:54.485
Sounds like a plan.

241
00:27:55.721 --> 00:27:57.021
What do you really think?

242
00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.090
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

243
00:28:02.227 --> 00:28:03.727
We ain't gonna do this, right?

244
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.730
We'll play along for now.

245
00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:09.632
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

246
00:28:10.335 --> 00:28:12.835
Get a chance to see how
their world really ticks.

247
00:28:13.338 --> 00:28:15.238
I had enough of their world.

248
00:28:16.341 --> 00:28:18.341
They're just shitting bricks because,

249
00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:20.142
they're no longer top
of the food chain.

250
00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:23.182
Damn man, I'm really worried
about him.

251
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.250
And look, I know he's
your friend and all, but...

252
00:28:26.852 --> 00:28:28.152
I think you should watch him.

253
00:28:29.187 --> 00:28:32.187
Nobody goes cold Turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

254
00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:16.967
Looking to get hooked up?

255
00:29:17.336 --> 00:29:18.403
Maybe.

256
00:29:18.505 --> 00:29:19.571
What do you have?

257
00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:20.839
No problem.

258
00:29:21.306 --> 00:29:22.026
Horse,

259
00:29:22.428 --> 00:29:23.410
Hawaiian ice,

260
00:29:23.412 --> 00:29:24.512
whatever you need.

261
00:29:25.845 --> 00:29:27.445
Whatever I need.

262
00:29:29.348 --> 00:29:30.440
I like that.

263
00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:32.042
What if I need you?

264
00:29:47.366 --> 00:29:48.966
So, so sweet.

265
00:30:25.305 --> 00:30:26.997
They are ready whenever you are,

266
00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:28.799
Daywalker.

267
00:30:42.754 --> 00:30:45.054
Blade, meet the bloodpack.

268
00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:48.259
Lighthammer.

269
00:30:48.804 --> 00:30:49.804
Verlaine.

270
00:30:51.096 --> 00:30:52.020
Priest.

271
00:30:52.922 --> 00:30:53.822
Snowman.

272
00:30:54.834 --> 00:30:55.615
Chupa.

273
00:30:56.317 --> 00:30:57.317
And Reinhardt.

274
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.550
Hey...

275
00:31:13.552 --> 00:31:15.852
Me and the gang were wondering...

276
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.890
What was that?

277
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:23.561
Can you blush?

278
00:31:24.863 --> 00:31:26.163
Here we go puppy.

279
00:31:29.969 --> 00:31:30.969
Oh, I get it.

280
00:31:32.404 --> 00:31:33.404
I see now.

281
00:31:34.306 --> 00:31:36.906
You've been training for two years
to take me out.

282
00:31:38.077 --> 00:31:39.477
And now, here I am.

283
00:31:41.746 --> 00:31:42.711
So exciting,

284
00:31:42.713 --> 00:31:43.713
isn't it?

285
00:31:44.514 --> 00:31:45.314
Ok.

286
00:31:45.517 --> 00:31:46.517
Here's your chance.

287
00:31:49.021 --> 00:31:49.583
Come on.

288
00:31:49.785 --> 00:31:51.085
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

289
00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:54.358
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

290
00:31:54.893 --> 00:31:56.293
Adolf here gets the first shot.

291
00:31:56.628 --> 00:31:58.128
Come on.
What are you looking at her for?

292
00:31:58.197 --> 00:31:59.297
You need permission?

293
00:32:00.332 --> 00:32:01.732
Maybe you need a little bit of incentive?

294
00:32:02.168 --> 00:32:03.768
Ok, I can help with that.

295
00:32:07.206 --> 00:32:08.076
What's the matter?

296
00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:08.978
Missed that?

297
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:10.508
It's ok, I can do it again.

298
00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:16.613
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

299
00:32:16.614 --> 00:32:17.515
Fucking do it!

300
00:32:17.516 --> 00:32:18.716
Do it!
Kill the bastard!

301
00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:28.659
Now you've got an explosive device

302
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.060
stuck to the back of your head.

303
00:32:30.462 --> 00:32:31.462
Silver nitrate.

304
00:32:31.998 --> 00:32:34.399
Rigged to go off if
anybody tampers with it.

305
00:32:34.966 --> 00:32:36.666
I'll have the detonator with me.

306
00:32:37.236 --> 00:32:38.224
And you,

307
00:32:38.826 --> 00:32:40.526
if you so much as look at me wrong...

308
00:32:44.776 --> 00:32:46.876
from now on we work as a unit.

309
00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:49.712
You'll be taking orders from me.

310
00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:53.851
Any questions?

311
00:32:59.925 --> 00:33:00.925
Good.

312
00:33:04.196 --> 00:33:05.496
You want to catch the hunter?

313
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.130
You start with the prey.

314
00:33:08.232 --> 00:33:10.132
We'll target all the night
places as where,

315
00:33:10.535 --> 00:33:12.135
vampires congregate.

316
00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:14.805
Blood banks, safe houses.

317
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.440
The bigger the better.

318
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.210
So...

319
00:33:19.878 --> 00:33:20.978
What's first?

320
00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:26.817
The house of pain.

321
00:33:40.566 --> 00:33:41.666
Where's the entrance?

322
00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:44.869
I don't see any signs.

323
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.170
No vampire glyphs.

324
00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:50.139
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits,

325
00:33:51.577 --> 00:33:53.077
tighten our security.

326
00:33:55.747 --> 00:33:56.847
Have a closer look.

327
00:34:05.324 --> 00:34:06.124
Nice.

328
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:06.852
38,

329
00:34:06.854 --> 00:34:08.960
45 and 9mm caliber.

330
00:34:09.027 --> 00:34:11.462
All with foil capsules at the tip filled

331
00:34:11.463 --> 00:34:13.363
with silver nitrate and garlic extract.

332
00:34:13.598 --> 00:34:15.598
This hyper velocity stake gun

333
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:18.599
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

334
00:34:18.971 --> 00:34:21.071
Since you suckers don't like sunlight,

335
00:34:21.607 --> 00:34:23.407
we've modified the gun's entry light,

336
00:34:23.475 --> 00:34:24.975
with a UV filter.

337
00:34:25.477 --> 00:34:26.329
Pop it open,

338
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:27.631
instant UV light.

339
00:34:30.015 --> 00:34:31.982
Filter's on, no problem.

340
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.150
Yo, B, check this out.

341
00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:35.351
It's got a pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

342
00:34:36.087 --> 00:34:39.022
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

343
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.990
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

344
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:43.497
The cartridge ejects.

345
00:34:43.499 --> 00:34:44.699
Automatic reload.

346
00:34:45.197 --> 00:34:46.197
Nice.

347
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.335
Let's go.

348
00:34:49.537 --> 00:34:51.303
You won't pass for one of us.

349
00:34:51.304 --> 00:34:52.069
No way.

350
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.370
Like I give a shit.
No, he's right.

351
00:34:55.807 --> 00:34:57.807
Why don't you post up on
the roof over there?

352
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.710
Cover our backs.

353
00:35:01.246 --> 00:35:03.346
So the bloodpack's calling
the shots now.

354
00:35:05.484 --> 00:35:06.484
Great.

355
00:35:09.188 --> 00:35:11.890
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

356
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:17.361
Keep pushing, asshole.

357
00:36:02.474 --> 00:36:03.474
We're in.

358
00:36:13.017 --> 00:36:14.617
You're about to enter our world.

359
00:36:15.019 --> 00:36:16.380
You will see things...

360
00:36:16.682 --> 00:36:17.682
feeding.

361
00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:19.689
Just remember why you're here.

362
00:36:21.392 --> 00:36:22.592
I haven't forgotten.

363
00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:38.408
What exactly are we looking for in here?

364
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.210
Anything that looks suspicious.

365
00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:49.853
You got to be kidding me.

366
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:46.309
Scud, do you read me?

367
00:37:50.215 --> 00:37:51.938
<i>Scud, you reading me?</i>

368
00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.819
Yeah. Reading you loud and clear B.

369
00:37:53.885 --> 00:37:55.385
<i>The whole place is a safe house.</i>

370
00:37:55.887 --> 00:37:58.287
<i>The windows are painted black,
one access door.</i>

371
00:37:58.389 --> 00:38:00.252
<i>200, 300 suckheads in here.</i>

372
00:38:00.254 --> 00:38:01.354
That sounds cool.

373
00:38:02.828 --> 00:38:04.028
Hey, W, you got me?

374
00:38:07.332 --> 00:38:08.232
W?

375
00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:15.303
<i>Hey tell me something,
how's the weather up there, sweet heart?</i>

376
00:38:15.806 --> 00:38:18.106
Walking on sunshine, toad boy.

377
00:38:24.649 --> 00:38:25.428
Look at them.

378
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.330
Half of these bastards,
they're not even pure bloods.

379
00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:30.955
I tell you what,

380
00:38:31.023 --> 00:38:33.057
why don't we just fucking kill everyone?

381
00:38:34.392 --> 00:38:35.592
Just to make sure.

382
00:38:40.498 --> 00:38:42.266
God, it would be so easy.

383
00:38:59.384 --> 00:39:00.684
He's got you.

384
00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:09.385
Fuck you.

385
00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:33.583
Daywalker.

386
00:40:48.593 --> 00:40:49.693
Mother's milk.

387
00:40:51.062 --> 00:40:53.362
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, cinderella.

388
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
<i>Hurry up.</i>

389
00:41:13.384 --> 00:41:14.484
<i>I spotted one, but lost him.</i>

390
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:16.521
<i>Be on the lookout.</i>

391
00:41:26.464 --> 00:41:27.464
Fuck.

392
00:42:58.021 --> 00:42:59.221
Whistler, they're on the roof.

393
00:42:59.323 --> 00:43:00.423
I got them on the roof of my bus.

394
00:44:27.712 --> 00:44:28.812
Nomak.

395
00:44:30.548 --> 00:44:31.948
Daywalker.

396
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.351
What am I to you?

397
00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.720
Is the enemy of my enemy
my friend...

398
00:44:39.457 --> 00:44:40.657
Or my enemy?

399
00:44:59.511 --> 00:45:00.511
<i>We're under attack!</i>

400
00:45:00.712 --> 00:45:02.012
<i>There's three of them.
Probably more.</i>

401
00:45:13.023 --> 00:45:14.023
Daylight.

402
00:46:58.563 --> 00:47:01.363
<i>Silver don't do Jack shit, man.
Don't waste the bullets!</i>

403
00:47:01.364 --> 00:47:02.270
Motherfucker.

404
00:47:02.672 --> 00:47:04.072
<i>You hear me, Chupa?</i>

405
00:47:04.736 --> 00:47:06.036
Say, cheese.

406
00:47:23.454 --> 00:47:24.254
Come on.

407
00:48:04.328 --> 00:48:06.128
How about some daylight, motherfucker?

408
00:50:02.713 --> 00:50:04.181
Fuck!

409
00:51:02.906 --> 00:51:05.106
Listen to me. If you're under
attack, use your UV lights.

410
00:51:05.107 --> 00:51:06.807
<i>Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.</i>

411
00:51:57.127 --> 00:51:57.927
Priest?

412
00:51:58.624 --> 00:52:00.324
We're not dying here, man.

413
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:01.630
Come on.

414
00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:03.199
Priest is down.

415
00:52:08.205 --> 00:52:09.405
<i>Daylight's coming.</i>

416
00:52:09.707 --> 00:52:11.107
<i>You're on your own, Blade.</i>

417
00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:37.299
You want me so bad, Blade?

418
00:52:39.403 --> 00:52:40.703
Here I am.

419
00:52:43.473 --> 00:52:44.573
Why kill me?

420
00:52:48.012 --> 00:52:49.112
You and I,

421
00:52:49.313 --> 00:52:50.913
we have the same enemy.

422
00:52:51.415 --> 00:52:52.715
We want the same thing.

423
00:54:31.982 --> 00:54:33.182
We need the same thing, Blade.

424
00:55:26.704 --> 00:55:27.804
What happened?

425
00:55:28.522 --> 00:55:31.422
Why didn't you tell me these things
were immune to silver and garlic?

426
00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:32.501
I didn't know.

427
00:55:33.544 --> 00:55:35.244
If you did, would you have told me?

428
00:55:37.214 --> 00:55:39.714
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

429
00:55:40.717 --> 00:55:42.417
Then why didn't he kill you?

430
00:55:48.892 --> 00:55:50.392
How long since he's been bitten?

431
00:55:50.894 --> 00:55:52.137
About 20 minutes.

432
00:55:52.139 --> 00:55:53.839
His skin is fucking burning.

433
00:55:54.064 --> 00:55:55.764
He's already starting to change.

434
00:55:59.236 --> 00:56:02.136
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

435
00:56:21.524 --> 00:56:22.392
Hold on!

436
00:56:22.959 --> 00:56:24.054
Hold him, Chupa!

437
00:56:24.456 --> 00:56:25.496
Come on, man!

438
00:56:25.562 --> 00:56:27.497
Put him out of his fucking misery!

439
00:56:28.765 --> 00:56:31.201
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

440
00:56:31.568 --> 00:56:33.668
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!

441
00:56:37.808 --> 00:56:38.808
Move.

442
00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:43.747
Back off.

443
00:56:44.148 --> 00:56:45.248
Back off!

444
00:56:58.395 --> 00:57:01.466
If that was your bloodpack
Sunday punch, we're in trouble.

445
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:03.491
This motherfucker left his post.

446
00:57:03.834 --> 00:57:05.634
He just disappeared.
Where were you?

447
00:57:06.137 --> 00:57:08.291
Ran into a little reaper action myself.

448
00:57:08.293 --> 00:57:09.140
Oh, yeah?

449
00:57:09.406 --> 00:57:10.456
How little?

450
00:57:11.007 --> 00:57:13.007
We lost a man, Priest.

451
00:57:13.209 --> 00:57:15.909
You want me to carve
his name on your chest?

452
00:57:18.214 --> 00:57:19.414
Let me show you.

453
00:57:28.024 --> 00:57:30.160
Saw him moving in the alley
and followed it down.

454
00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:31.561
Found it just like this.

455
00:57:32.195 --> 00:57:33.595
I think they came through here.

456
00:57:34.698 --> 00:57:36.799
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert.

457
00:57:36.867 --> 00:57:39.034
Caught his arm.

458
00:57:39.102 --> 00:57:41.402
Been gnawing at it like a coyote.

459
00:57:43.874 --> 00:57:45.274
Little boy blue.

460
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:48.810
It's already dying.

461
00:57:49.546 --> 00:57:51.948
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

462
00:57:53.884 --> 00:57:55.082
Ok, look for a lever.

463
00:57:55.084 --> 00:57:56.020
Let's open it.

464
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.940
They've made contact
with the reapers.

465
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.425
Any casualties?

466
00:58:21.827 --> 00:58:23.027
One so far.

467
00:58:23.747 --> 00:58:25.047
It was not...

468
00:58:26.016 --> 00:58:27.616
Nyssa, I trust?

469
00:58:29.351 --> 00:58:30.351
No.

470
00:58:32.188 --> 00:58:34.288
This a dangerous game you're playing,
Damaskinos.

471
00:58:35.158 --> 00:58:36.458
Blade is too volatile.

472
00:58:37.193 --> 00:58:39.793
You're not going to be able
to keep manipulating him.

473
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:41.530
You worry too much.

474
00:58:41.732 --> 00:58:43.932
I've been informed
by our friend inside

475
00:58:43.933 --> 00:58:46.233
that events are unfolding as scripted.

476
00:58:46.234 --> 00:58:48.134
You've already lost one of your own.

477
00:58:48.471 --> 00:58:50.171
How many more are you willing
to sacrifice?

478
00:58:52.876 --> 00:58:53.876
Everyone.

479
00:58:54.545 --> 00:58:55.845
Even your own daughter?

480
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.385
Yes.
Even her.

481
00:59:11.895 --> 00:59:13.229
Recognize this?

482
00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:14.697
The blood bank.

483
00:59:15.098 --> 00:59:16.198
He's one of the guards.

484
00:59:17.333 --> 00:59:19.233
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?

485
00:59:20.904 --> 00:59:21.904
Time.

486
00:59:22.906 --> 00:59:24.908
His metabolism is burning too fast.

487
00:59:26.376 --> 00:59:28.778
They need fresh blood
every couple of hours,

488
00:59:29.045 --> 00:59:31.445
or they'll start feeding on themselves.

489
00:59:31.682 --> 00:59:32.816
Nomak's different.

490
00:59:33.684 --> 00:59:34.815
He's the carrier.

491
00:59:35.117 --> 00:59:36.617
It all started with him.

492
00:59:36.987 --> 00:59:38.187
It'll end with him.

493
01:00:03.379 --> 01:00:04.579
Open the mouth, Scud.

494
01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.450
Open the mouth.

495
01:00:09.385 --> 01:00:10.585
B, come on.

496
01:00:11.755 --> 01:00:12.855
Sissy.

497
01:00:30.073 --> 01:00:32.273
Only the tongue carries the virus.

498
01:00:32.743 --> 01:00:34.843
It is injected through these barbs.

499
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.780
It has bifurcated masseter muscles.

500
01:00:40.283 --> 01:00:41.362
Overdeveloped,

501
01:00:41.364 --> 01:00:42.964
allowing for a much stronger bite.

502
01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:47.522
The jaw structure remains the same.

503
01:00:47.924 --> 01:00:49.724
But there is no mandible bone.

504
01:00:51.094 --> 01:00:52.494
Squeeze that tooth Scud.

505
01:01:04.374 --> 01:01:05.374
Neurotoxin.

506
01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:08.645
Probably paralyzes their victim
while they feed.

507
01:01:13.216 --> 01:01:15.516
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

508
01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:18.086
We got to go with the sunlight, right?

509
01:01:18.087 --> 01:01:19.587
That's deadly to us, too.

510
01:01:20.557 --> 01:01:22.357
So let's see what else we can find.

511
01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:51.179
These things are as different from us

512
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:53.481
as we are from you.

513
01:01:59.479 --> 01:02:00.779
Look at that.

514
01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:03.115
The heart is encased in bone.

515
01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:05.683
Only the side is vulnerable.

516
01:02:05.785 --> 01:02:07.685
Good luck getting a stake through that.

517
01:02:07.687 --> 01:02:10.387
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own,

518
01:02:11.324 --> 01:02:13.924
essentially trying to walk without
a body attached to it.

519
01:02:14.695 --> 01:02:15.739
What are you doing?

520
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.141
Hard-wired, right?

521
01:02:23.403 --> 01:02:24.903
What the fuck is that?

522
01:02:26.773 --> 01:02:27.773
Brain's dead.

523
01:02:28.575 --> 01:02:29.975
Body's still trying to feed.

524
01:02:31.212 --> 01:02:33.180
We got six hours before sunrise.

525
01:02:34.547 --> 01:02:35.547
Be ready by then.

526
01:02:36.183 --> 01:02:37.183
Hey...

527
01:02:38.385 --> 01:02:39.585
What happens at sunrise?

528
01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:43.889
Blade, I'm talking to you.

529
01:02:44.224 --> 01:02:46.024
What happens at sunrise?

530
01:02:47.394 --> 01:02:48.539
We hunt.

531
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:50.341
In broad daylight?

532
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.431
You got be fucking joking.

533
01:02:52.499 --> 01:02:54.899
You better get you some
sunscreen, buttercup.

534
01:02:54.935 --> 01:02:56.202
Listen, shitkicker.

535
01:02:56.469 --> 01:02:59.205
You're about one cunt hair away
from hillbilly heaven.

536
01:02:59.973 --> 01:03:01.773
I love it when you talk dirty.

537
01:03:05.178 --> 01:03:06.846
Sunlight's the only edge we've got.

538
01:03:07.414 --> 01:03:09.238
They'll be more vulnerable then.

539
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.340
And so will we.

540
01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:14.186
Let's be real about one thing.

541
01:03:15.855 --> 01:03:18.055
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

542
01:03:19.927 --> 01:03:21.527
Remember to protect yourselves...

543
01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:22.962
at all times.

544
01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:33.271
What are you looking for?

545
01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:35.274
Phosphor rods.

546
01:03:35.642 --> 01:03:37.183
If I can suss out the light source,

547
01:03:37.185 --> 01:03:38.483
maybe I can make some sort of

548
01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.085
UV flash-bang grenade or something.

549
01:03:41.381 --> 01:03:42.881
It's been tried already.

550
01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:45.918
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster
working on it then, now did ya?

551
01:03:58.398 --> 01:03:59.398
Blade.

552
01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:02.536
The way you talk to them, us.

553
01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:03.838
What is it?

554
01:04:04.171 --> 01:04:06.071
We are together in this, remember?

555
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:09.241
Why do you hate us so much?

556
01:04:10.009 --> 01:04:11.309
It's fate.

557
01:04:12.912 --> 01:04:13.866
It's in my blood.

558
01:04:13.868 --> 01:04:15.149
Well, it's in mine, too.

559
01:04:15.415 --> 01:04:17.315
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.

560
01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:25.523
You know the thirst better
than any of us,

561
01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:27.392
shooting that serum of yours.

562
01:04:27.894 --> 01:04:29.394
The only difference between us,

563
01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:32.196
is that I made peace with
what I am a long time ago.

564
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.340
How long have
you known Blade, anyway?

565
01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:43.641
Going on 20 years.

566
01:04:44.244 --> 01:04:46.144
He doesn't talk about
the old days that much.

567
01:04:47.247 --> 01:04:49.247
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.

568
01:04:51.051 --> 01:04:52.151
You want to hear something funny?

569
01:04:53.053 --> 01:04:55.653
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

570
01:04:57.557 --> 01:04:58.557
Tell me something.

571
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.393
How'd you two hook up?

572
01:05:02.462 --> 01:05:03.562
I was backpacking.

573
01:05:04.164 --> 01:05:05.357
I met these two chicks,

574
01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:07.442
decided to take them back
to my tent,

575
01:05:07.444 --> 01:05:09.144
for a little three's company action.

576
01:05:10.203 --> 01:05:10.905
Pretty.

577
01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:12.279
Next thing I know,
Janet and Chrissy start,

578
01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:14.381
tearing chunks out of my stomach.

579
01:05:14.474 --> 01:05:16.974
Blade shows up, saves my ass.

580
01:05:17.577 --> 01:05:19.777
Everything else
just sort of fell into place.

581
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:24.300
Let's try it.

582
01:05:24.702 --> 01:05:25.702
Alright.

583
01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:40.031
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

584
01:05:45.939 --> 01:05:46.939
Alright.

585
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.440
Papa's got a brand new bag.

586
01:06:29.516 --> 01:06:31.016
Let me ask one question.

587
01:06:31.518 --> 01:06:33.618
How are we going
to find these reapers?

588
01:06:33.853 --> 01:06:35.053
We won't have to.

589
01:06:35.688 --> 01:06:36.688
They'll come to us.

590
01:06:42.195 --> 01:06:43.079
What is this shit?

591
01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:44.381
Pheromones.

592
01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:46.331
Harvested from the reapers'
adrenal glands.

593
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.400
They're going to key to it.

594
01:06:51.204 --> 01:06:54.604
They want us to spray on some
suckpuppy's nut juice?

595
01:06:56.209 --> 01:06:58.309
First use your firearms
to drive them back.

596
01:06:58.878 --> 01:07:00.794
Then toss your UV grenades.

597
01:07:00.796 --> 01:07:01.496
Right on.

598
01:07:01.681 --> 01:07:03.081
This is what we got
for the grand finale.

599
01:07:03.316 --> 01:07:04.816
I hot-wired a couple of these babies,

600
01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:06.484
into a nitro-vacuum.

601
01:07:07.687 --> 01:07:10.121
Just be real careful where
you pop your load, alright.

602
01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:12.389
And you, you're not coming?

603
01:07:12.392 --> 01:07:14.992
No. I'm a lover, not a fighter.

604
01:07:16.663 --> 01:07:18.597
UV's have a 10-second delay.

605
01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:21.333
Nyssa.

606
01:07:22.335 --> 01:07:23.835
Just remember to take cover.

607
01:07:27.507 --> 01:07:28.420
Hey Blade,

608
01:07:28.422 --> 01:07:29.522
give me a hand.

609
01:07:34.347 --> 01:07:36.447
You and miss muffet getting a little cozy?

610
01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:39.317
I wouldn't worry about that if I was you.

611
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.954
Looks to me like
you're getting confused,

612
01:07:43.022 --> 01:07:45.325
as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

613
01:07:46.693 --> 01:07:48.913
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man

614
01:07:48.914 --> 01:07:51.414
who just spent two years
running with the enemy.

615
01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:54.865
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

616
01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.934
You know Whistler,
there is an old saying...

617
01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:01.707
keep your friends close,

618
01:08:02.642 --> 01:08:04.742
but keep your enemies closer.

619
01:08:05.478 --> 01:08:07.378
You might want to remember that.

620
01:08:31.605 --> 01:08:33.605
<i>Blade, we should split into three units.</i>

621
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.635
We're trying to attract them,

622
01:09:48.637 --> 01:09:50.037
not scare them off.

623
01:09:50.717 --> 01:09:52.951
Yeah? Well, some of us can't
see in the dark,

624
01:09:53.019 --> 01:09:55.319
you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?

625
01:09:56.523 --> 01:09:59.123
Bifocals, grandpa.
Try and keep up.

626
01:10:56.249 --> 01:10:57.549
Let's do this.

627
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:05.137
Hey, hillbilly.

628
01:11:05.939 --> 01:11:07.539
What the fuck you doing?

629
01:11:08.695 --> 01:11:10.695
Ain't nobody here but you...

630
01:11:11.163 --> 01:11:13.663
And us, buttercup.

631
01:11:16.302 --> 01:11:17.480
We lose a partner,

632
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.982
and Blade loses one!

633
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.680
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

634
01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:06.343
<i>I spotted a group in the east tunnel.</i>

635
01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:08.779
<i>I'm prepping the bomb pack.</i>

636
01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:10.181
Nyssa.

637
01:13:34.272 --> 01:13:35.272
Get out!

638
01:13:35.675 --> 01:13:36.675
Right now!

639
01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080
No!

640
01:13:46.218 --> 01:13:47.218
No!

641
01:13:50.123 --> 01:13:51.450
I'll attract them to me.

642
01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:52.492
Do what I tell you.

643
01:13:53.059 --> 01:13:54.059
Move!

644
01:13:57.063 --> 01:13:57.863
10...

645
01:13:58.798 --> 01:13:59.598
9...

646
01:14:00.567 --> 01:14:01.367
8...

647
01:14:02.201 --> 01:14:03.001
7...

648
01:14:04.203 --> 01:14:05.003
6...

649
01:14:05.905 --> 01:14:06.905
5...

650
01:14:08.608 --> 01:14:09.508
4...

651
01:14:10.977 --> 01:14:11.777
3...

652
01:14:12.979 --> 01:14:13.979
2...

653
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:18.310
1...

654
01:14:43.342 --> 01:14:45.010
Piece of junk.

655
01:14:59.058 --> 01:15:00.558
What the hell is this?

656
01:15:02.394 --> 01:15:04.794
You trying to stink me to death, old man?

657
01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:16.341
Wait.

658
01:15:18.678 --> 01:15:20.346
You ok?
Yeah.

659
01:15:21.213 --> 01:15:22.213
We have to move.

660
01:15:22.749 --> 01:15:23.949
We got a lot of company.

661
01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:29.253
All units, regroup.

662
01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:30.387
Regroup!

663
01:15:56.649 --> 01:15:59.450
Eat shit, you ugly motherfuckers!

664
01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:04.421
There's nobody left!

665
01:16:23.943 --> 01:16:24.855
Where's the bomb pack?

666
01:16:25.357 --> 01:16:26.557
I let it down that tunnel.

667
01:16:26.913 --> 01:16:28.213
Give me the rest of the pheromones.

668
01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:33.250
Go down that tunnel! Go!

669
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:34.751
Go, go, go, go!

670
01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:37.856
You obviously...

671
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:40.191
do not know...

672
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.560
Whom you are fucking with!

673
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:19.630
<i>By the way Blade...</i>

674
01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:21.380
<i>Did I happen to mention,</i>

675
01:17:21.382 --> 01:17:22.982
the bomb lever is stuck?

676
01:17:28.674 --> 01:17:29.774
Suck this!

677
01:17:32.678 --> 01:17:33.878
Let's go!

678
01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:17.153
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!

679
01:18:17.556 --> 01:18:19.056
Come on, motherfucker!

680
01:19:38.004 --> 01:19:39.004
Whistler...

681
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:41.239
Wait.

682
01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:43.920
You will survive this,

683
01:19:44.422 --> 01:19:45.722
only to tell Blade...

684
01:19:47.746 --> 01:19:49.146
About this ring.

685
01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:51.182
About the truth.

686
01:19:51.683 --> 01:19:53.483
The truth, old man.

687
01:19:55.854 --> 01:19:57.254
Damaskinos...

688
01:20:06.198 --> 01:20:07.298
Nyssa...

689
01:21:36.288 --> 01:21:37.688
You've done a great job.

690
01:21:39.892 --> 01:21:40.979
Not that great,

691
01:21:41.381 --> 01:21:42.381
I'd say.

692
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:05.917
What is it...

693
01:22:06.685 --> 01:22:07.885
my daughter?

694
01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.270
They took them.

695
01:22:59.472 --> 01:23:01.472
All our weapons.
Even your sword.

696
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.576
Somebody's been keeping
tabs on us from inside.

697
01:23:04.743 --> 01:23:05.784
Where are we?

698
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.464
Some kind of chamber,

699
01:23:07.466 --> 01:23:08.766
deep in their lair.

700
01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:11.275
They smashed up everything,

701
01:23:11.277 --> 01:23:13.186
the workshop, all of it.

702
01:23:14.786 --> 01:23:16.986
They've been lying to us from day one.

703
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:20.090
The reaper strain didn't evolve...

704
01:23:21.327 --> 01:23:22.327
It was designed.

705
01:23:23.294 --> 01:23:24.296
What?

706
01:23:24.463 --> 01:23:25.569
Designed.

707
01:23:25.571 --> 01:23:26.599
Nomak told me.

708
01:23:26.865 --> 01:23:28.165
I saw him back in the sewer.

709
01:23:28.867 --> 01:23:30.667
He let me live.
Did he?

710
01:23:32.238 --> 01:23:33.972
How generous of him.

711
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.840
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

712
01:23:42.615 --> 01:23:44.215
For years I've struggled

713
01:23:44.617 --> 01:23:48.077
to rid our kind of any
hereditary weaknesses.

714
01:23:49.354 --> 01:23:50.050
So...

715
01:23:50.952 --> 01:23:52.952
recombining DNA.

716
01:23:53.325 --> 01:23:55.925
Was simply the next logical step.

717
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.443
Nomak was the first.

718
01:24:00.445 --> 01:24:01.434
A failure.

719
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:03.201
But in time,

720
01:24:05.136 --> 01:24:07.436
there will be a new pure race,

721
01:24:07.673 --> 01:24:09.473
begotten from my own flesh,

722
01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.942
immune to silver,

723
01:24:13.145 --> 01:24:15.545
soon even sunlight.

724
01:24:16.214 --> 01:24:19.314
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

725
01:24:19.618 --> 01:24:22.318
You want to explain how
Nomak got ahold of this ring?

726
01:24:32.498 --> 01:24:34.898
I would have thought that
was obvious at this point.

727
01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:38.627
I gave it to him, of course a gift,

728
01:24:39.529 --> 01:24:41.229
from father to son.

729
01:24:52.484 --> 01:24:54.584
I thought he'd never leave.

730
01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:02.125
The wolf has lain with the sheep...

731
01:25:02.427 --> 01:25:03.527
long enough.

732
01:25:04.562 --> 01:25:05.562
Reinhardt,

733
01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:08.631
you can kiss your ass goodbye.

734
01:25:16.573 --> 01:25:17.573
I'm sorry, man.

735
01:25:17.676 --> 01:25:18.360
B...

736
01:25:19.262 --> 01:25:20.662
you're wasting your time, man.

737
01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:21.763
The bomb's a dud.

738
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:23.648
It was never supposed to explode.

739
01:25:24.016 --> 01:25:26.416
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

740
01:25:27.285 --> 01:25:28.685
You thought you had me
on a short leash,

741
01:25:29.487 --> 01:25:30.723
didn't you, jefe?

742
01:25:38.997 --> 01:25:39.997
Much better.

743
01:25:43.502 --> 01:25:44.602
See this?

744
01:25:46.372 --> 01:25:47.872
I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.

745
01:25:48.774 --> 01:25:51.274
They needed my help to bring you
here to control Nomak.

746
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:53.910
The old fuck, he was always just bait.

747
01:25:53.979 --> 01:25:54.979
Look at him.

748
01:25:56.115 --> 01:25:57.715
He's your only real weakness, man.

749
01:25:58.050 --> 01:25:59.817
You may be fast, you may be strong,

750
01:25:59.885 --> 01:26:01.185
and all that other bullshit,

751
01:26:01.553 --> 01:26:02.853
but in the end, B...

752
01:26:03.055 --> 01:26:04.455
You're just too human!

753
01:26:06.158 --> 01:26:08.058
Well, you little shit.

754
01:26:12.497 --> 01:26:14.897
You think they scoped out
my security system?

755
01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:17.433
I let them in, asshole!

756
01:26:18.703 --> 01:26:20.303
I practically handed them the keys.

757
01:26:20.938 --> 01:26:22.238
You heard cue ball, alright?

758
01:26:22.474 --> 01:26:24.774
Pretty soon they're
all going to be daywalkers, man.

759
01:26:25.343 --> 01:26:26.543
When that happens,

760
01:26:26.979 --> 01:26:28.880
I'd rather be a pet than cattle.

761
01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:29.981
You got me, B?

762
01:26:32.818 --> 01:26:34.118
What do you think about that, man?

763
01:26:34.545 --> 01:26:35.545
Two things...

764
01:26:36.688 --> 01:26:37.688
one...

765
01:26:38.356 --> 01:26:39.755
I've been onto you,

766
01:26:40.857 --> 01:26:42.057
since they turned you.

767
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:43.661
And two...

768
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:47.231
It's not a dud.

769
01:26:48.633 --> 01:26:49.633
Great.

770
01:26:58.376 --> 01:27:00.244
I was just starting to like him.

771
01:27:00.313 --> 01:27:01.480
Take him down!

772
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.680
We're going to harvest your blood,

773
01:27:38.016 --> 01:27:39.316
every drop of it.

774
01:27:39.517 --> 01:27:42.417
Then bone marrow, organs, everything.

775
01:27:43.755 --> 01:27:45.055
We'll find the missing key,

776
01:27:45.090 --> 01:27:46.690
to creating daywalkers.

777
01:27:54.567 --> 01:27:56.735
Now this might hurt a bit.

778
01:28:01.039 --> 01:28:02.440
Nice.

779
01:28:04.343 --> 01:28:05.343
I wonder...

780
01:28:06.478 --> 01:28:09.447
How many vampires he's killed with this thing.

781
01:28:10.015 --> 01:28:11.549
Not nearly enough, Fritz.

782
01:28:13.218 --> 01:28:14.719
Keep talking, honky-tonk.

783
01:28:14.787 --> 01:28:16.687
Just makes my sending
you to the next world...

784
01:28:17.656 --> 01:28:18.975
all the sweeter.

785
01:28:18.977 --> 01:28:20.777
Been there, done that.

786
01:28:21.459 --> 01:28:22.959
Do your worst, chickenshit.

787
01:28:23.896 --> 01:28:25.496
We'll settle up after.

788
01:28:47.019 --> 01:28:48.887
What else should I find out?

789
01:28:49.955 --> 01:28:51.623
I trusted you...

790
01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:53.726
with my men,

791
01:28:55.193 --> 01:28:56.295
with my will,

792
01:28:57.362 --> 01:28:58.662
with my life.

793
01:29:02.034 --> 01:29:04.002
You sent us out there.

794
01:29:06.738 --> 01:29:08.238
You sent me to die.

795
01:29:11.643 --> 01:29:13.652
Our enemy saved my life twice,

796
01:29:13.954 --> 01:29:15.354
and you have used us...

797
01:29:16.373 --> 01:29:17.573
your own children.

798
01:29:19.918 --> 01:29:21.518
Make no mistake Nyssa.

799
01:29:22.087 --> 01:29:23.675
Those blood ties,

800
01:29:24.077 --> 01:29:27.777
mean nothing to me when measured
against the ascendancy of our race.

801
01:29:30.028 --> 01:29:33.865
Who do you think God really
favors in the web?

802
01:29:36.734 --> 01:29:37.774
The spider,

803
01:29:38.076 --> 01:29:39.176
or the fly?

804
01:29:44.176 --> 01:29:45.843
Nomak...

805
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:53.050
What about him?

806
01:29:53.952 --> 01:29:56.152
He wants revenge...

807
01:29:57.089 --> 01:29:58.993
on the people who...

808
01:30:00.018 --> 01:30:01.718
created him.

809
01:30:03.061 --> 01:30:04.361
You may be right.

810
01:30:05.197 --> 01:30:06.797
But fortunately for us,

811
01:30:07.866 --> 01:30:09.966
he doesn't know this location.

812
01:30:12.204 --> 01:30:13.304
Now...

813
01:30:14.739 --> 01:30:16.273
He does.

814
01:30:45.737 --> 01:30:47.337
What the fuck?

815
01:31:41.959 --> 01:31:43.059
Come on, kid.

816
01:31:43.295 --> 01:31:45.495
Don't you even think about
dying on me.

817
01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.887
You didn't give up on me,

818
01:31:48.889 --> 01:31:50.503
I won't give up on you.

819
01:31:51.069 --> 01:31:52.044
Come on.

820
01:31:52.346 --> 01:31:53.139
Blade.

821
01:32:02.046 --> 01:32:03.114
Blood...

822
01:32:04.849 --> 01:32:06.118
Yeah.

823
01:32:07.185 --> 01:32:08.385
Blood.

824
01:32:44.072 --> 01:32:46.640
Father!

825
01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:48.408
He'll never enter here.

826
01:32:55.917 --> 01:32:57.017
Father!

827
01:33:23.044 --> 01:33:24.344
Father!

828
01:33:52.908 --> 01:33:54.108
Go on, kid.

829
01:33:57.979 --> 01:33:59.079
Go!

830
01:36:17.586 --> 01:36:18.653
Get him!

831
01:36:32.234 --> 01:36:33.234
Get in there!

832
01:36:51.117 --> 01:36:51.852
Well...

833
01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:55.155
Like my daddy said before
he killed my mom,

834
01:36:56.023 --> 01:36:58.123
you want anything done right,
you got to do it yourself.

835
01:37:02.964 --> 01:37:04.164
He also said...

836
01:37:20.682 --> 01:37:22.082
Can you blush?

837
01:37:36.631 --> 01:37:37.631
Hey, kid.

838
01:38:18.339 --> 01:38:19.939
I reset the security code.

839
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:23.141
We're locked in.

840
01:38:23.142 --> 01:38:25.547
Are you insane?

841
01:38:27.515 --> 01:38:28.856
He'll kill us both.

842
01:38:28.858 --> 01:38:29.584
Yes.

843
01:38:32.353 --> 01:38:35.222
Isn't it sad that you die not
by the hand of your enemy,

844
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:38.392
but by that of your own children?

845
01:38:48.636 --> 01:38:49.636
Father.

846
01:40:24.365 --> 01:40:25.765
Nyssa...

847
01:41:16.551 --> 01:41:17.551
Nomak!

848
01:41:22.223 --> 01:41:24.891
Blade, it could end right here.

849
01:41:25.159 --> 01:41:26.961
What do you think?

850
01:44:23.704 --> 01:44:25.004
After all...

851
01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.840
It looks like I've finished
my father's job.

852
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:31.770
It's strange.

853
01:45:33.073 --> 01:45:34.073
It hurts.

854
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:36.109
It hurts no more.

855
01:46:36.203 --> 01:46:37.703
It won't be long.

856
01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:42.040
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

857
01:46:46.547 --> 01:46:49.249
I want to die while
I'm still a vampire.

858
01:47:02.997 --> 01:47:05.097
I want to see the sun.

859
01:48:40.243 --> 01:48:41.578
By booth number three.

860
01:48:41.845 --> 01:48:43.080
Enjoy, man.

861
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.445
Are you sure...

862
01:48:50.747 --> 01:48:53.347
that the girls are live?

863
01:48:53.524 --> 01:48:55.124
Last time I checked.

864
01:48:55.659 --> 01:48:56.659
Thank you.

865
01:48:57.161 --> 01:48:59.061
A couple of razor Blades,

866
01:48:59.191 --> 01:49:00.231
just in case...

867
01:49:08.071 --> 01:49:10.071
<i>You didn't think I forgot about you, did you?</i>
