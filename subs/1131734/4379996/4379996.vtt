2
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.067
Every day I get letters.

3
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:52.740
I think I get more letters than Santa
Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined.

4
00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.621
I'm kinda the shit.

5
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.376
Rec time started
five minutes ago, Needy.

6
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:06.587
Grassy-ass, Raymundo.

7
00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:15.639
Sometimes, the letters are from people
who say they're praying for me.

8
00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:19.851
They tell me everything will be okay
if I just acceptJesus Christ into my heart.

9
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.940
I say the words,
but nothing ever happens.

10
00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:27.901
Nobody comes back.

11
00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.570
Nobody gets offthe cross.

12
00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:37.702
Welcome to the Mental Olympics.

13
00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:40.789
They're big on recreation here.

14
00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:43.375
Supposedly, it helps us
vent our aggressions.

15
00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:47.379
Oh, yeah!

16
00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:52.134
Personally, I think they're
trying to wear us out,

17
00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.886
keep us sluggish
so there won't be an uprising.

18
00:01:56.013 --> 00:01:59.141
Well, those J.V. tactics
won't work against me.

19
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.143
I'm a kicker.

20
00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:03.520
K- I-C-K-E-R.

21
00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:05.857
It even says so on my chart.

22
00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:10.278
Just one Toast 'Em, huh?

23
00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.449
I like Toast 'Ems.
Well, that's good.

24
00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.619
But I'm not sure a Toast 'Em can provide
sufficient energy during your day.

25
00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.872
I recommend
more complex carbo—

26
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.213
- No, she didn't!
- I recommend you shut the fuck up!

27
00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.591
All right.

28
00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.390
Don't touch me!

29
00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:01.121
I wasn't always this cracked.

30
00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.749
I used to be normal.

31
00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.794
Well, as normal as any girl
under the influence ofteenage hormones.

32
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.800
But after the killings began,
I started to feel—

33
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:15.802
I don't know-

34
00:03:15.887 --> 00:03:18.764
loose around the edges
or something.

35
00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.433
dd

36
00:03:25.563 --> 00:03:28.023
God!

37
00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.275
I hate this fucking song.

38
00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.115
dd

39
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.619
This is where
it all went down.

40
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.915
"Devil's Kettle"
sounds twisted, I know,

41
00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.668
but the place is just named
after a waterfall.

42
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.422
Technically,
it's not a normal waterfall.

43
00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:54.550
It goes into this hole,
and it doesn't come out.

44
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:58.096
The scientist guys dropped
all kinds ofthings down there,

45
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.348
but nothing ever surfaces.

46
00:04:00.432 --> 00:04:02.350
Maybe it's another dimension.

47
00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:05.019
Or, you know, just really deep.

48
00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:24.205
I'm working the back of my calves,
and I'm working my heart.

49
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.295
We're talkin' about butt.
We're talkin' about legs.

50
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.505
We're talking about
virtually no impact.

51
00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.842
This should sell for 14.95.

52
00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:41.389
Whole body calorie burning.
Whole body muscle toning. Everything.

53
00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:44.351
Now what about upper body?
All right. We'll do upper body.

54
00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:47.313
Chicken! We're working my butt.
We're working my abs.

55
00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:49.315
We're working
the inside of my thighs.

56
00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:51.525
Now, here's one
of our new movements.

57
00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:54.695
I want you to see the range of motion.
Just go to "Hurdle" or "Sprint. "

58
00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.655
Look at the sprint
that I have.

59
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.366
How many people
can get that range of motion?

60
00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:03.829
Say I wanna do just my hip flexors
or my buttocks even more.

61
00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:05.748
I do what's called digging.

62
00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:08.834
Look at the range of motion. I use
this for a lot of swimwear models.

63
00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:11.754
Very, very, very important.
How 'bout Butt Squeeze?

64
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.672
Yup. I see you wanted to touch.

65
00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:16.759
That's a good way
- Not this show! Not touching this show—

66
00:05:26.102 --> 00:05:28.312
Jennifer didn't always look this rough.

67
00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:33.067
dd

68
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:39.783
Just two months ago, me, Jennifer
and my boyfriend, Chip,

69
00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:42.702
were completely
normal people.

70
00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:45.330
We were our yearbook pictures.

71
00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:47.415
Nothing more, nothing less.

72
00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:53.713
d One d
d I'm biting my tongue d

73
00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:55.215
d Two d
d He's kissin' on you d

74
00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.467

75
00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:59.177
d One, two, three, four dd

76
00:05:59.261 --> 00:06:01.179
There'sJennifer.

77
00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:03.473
Only back then, we were tight.

78
00:06:03.557 --> 00:06:05.850
Sisters, practically.

79
00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:08.561
People found it hard to believe
that a babe like Jennifer...

80
00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:10.480
would associate
with a dork like me.

81
00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:13.441
Sandbox love never dies.

82
00:06:13.526 --> 00:06:15.944
d Dance, dance, dance, dance d
d You are the girl d

83
00:06:16.028 --> 00:06:18.655
d That I've been dreaming ofd

84
00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.282
You're totally
lesbi-gay.

85
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.284
What?
She's my best friend.

86
00:06:25.704 --> 00:06:30.000
d Ever since
I was a little girl d

87
00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:32.002

88

d Two d
d He's kissing on you dd

89
00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:37.091
Hey, Monistat.
What's up, Vagisil?

90
00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:39.927
You and me are going out
tonight. Uh, tonight. Why?

91
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:42.138
Because Low Shoulder
are playing at Melody Lane.

92
00:06:42.222 --> 00:06:44.140
They're this indie rock band
from the city.

93
00:06:44.224 --> 00:06:48.477
I saw their MySpace page,
and the lead singer's extra salty.

94
00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:50.396
Plus, there'll be lots
of other salty morsels there for you.

95
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.486
Come on, Needy. I promised Chip that
I would hang out with him tonight.

96
00:06:57.571 --> 00:06:59.613
Boo. Cross out Needy.

97
00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:06.662
What time is the show?
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

98
00:07:06.746 --> 00:07:09.373
My mom has a date with that
guy who owns the ham store.

99
00:07:09.457 --> 00:07:11.876
He seems nice.

100
00:07:12.002 --> 00:07:14.670
Wear something cute, okay?
Okay.

101
00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:24.723
"Wear something cute" meant something
very specific in Jennifer-speak.

102
00:07:24.807 --> 00:07:28.935
It meant I couldn't look like a total zero,
but I couldn't upstage her either.

103
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.898
I could expose my stomach,
but never my cleavage.

104
00:07:32.982 --> 00:07:34.983
Tits were her trademark.

105
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.198
Those jeans are hella low.
I can almost see your front butt.

106
00:07:41.282 --> 00:07:45.076
It's a rock show.
This is my rock look.

107
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.121
Well, I can see, like,
your womb, so—

108
00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:51.541
I've never even heard
of Low Shoulder.

109
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.045
Which one is Jennifer
stalking? The lead singer.

110
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:58.089
Girls like her don't go out
with drummers.

111
00:07:58.174 --> 00:08:00.050
- Thanks a lot.
- No offense.

112
00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:04.304
She'd probably make an exception ifyou were,
like, a drummer who's also the lead singer.

113
00:08:04.388 --> 00:08:06.806
- Like Phil Collins.
- Who's Phil Collins?

114
00:08:08.726 --> 00:08:12.103
Forget it.
He's seminal, but whatever.

115
00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:15.190
Anyway, this singer guy,
Jennifer says he's extra salty, so-

116
00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:17.777
Salty.

117
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:20.238
Salty means beautiful.

118
00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:23.282
Well, then you must be
soy sauce, babe.

119
00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:35.086
Jennifer's here.

120
00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:37.171
How do you know?
Needy!

121
00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:39.257
Quit tampooning yourself
and get down here.

122
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.259
That's fucking weird.

123
00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:44.345
Better hurry
before she gets annoyed.

124
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.847
You always do whatJennifer
tells you to do.

125
00:08:46.932 --> 00:08:50.768
No, I don't. It's just that I like
the same things that she likes.

126
00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:53.396
We have stuff in common.
That's why we're biffs.

127
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.607
You guys don't have
anything in common.

128
00:08:56.692 --> 00:08:58.901
Yeah. Okay, Chip.

129
00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:12.374
Guess who's got the whip
until 11:30.

130
00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:16.586
A 2003 Chrysler Sebring,
and it's all mine.

131
00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:19.214
Oh, hi, Chip.

132
00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:22.134
It smells like Thai food in here.

133
00:09:22.218 --> 00:09:25.470
- Have you guys been fucking?
- You're gross.

134
00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:28.098
- You're gross. You're gross.
- You're so gross.

135
00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:30.851
Fuck you.
Let's go to the club.

136
00:09:30.935 --> 00:09:33.979
Melody Lane is not a club.
It's a bar.

137
00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:36.440
It's not even a bar. It's
like a bingo hall with taps.

138
00:09:36.524 --> 00:09:39.234
Eat my ass, Chip. You're justJell-O
'cause you're not invited.

139
00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:41.653
I'm notJell-O.
That place is disgusting.

140
00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.614
Everyone in there has a
mustache. You're totallyJell-O.

141
00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:46.783
You're lime-green Jell-O, and you
can't even admit it to yourself.

142
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.872
Stop kidnapping my girlfriend.

143
00:09:51.998 --> 00:09:54.624
dd
You wish.

144
00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:02.925
Chip was right.

145
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.094
Melody Lane is definitely not a club.

146
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.265
Clubs are for attractive people
in populous urban areas.

147
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.392
Clubs have D.J.'s and champagne.

148
00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.978
As they come around the corner-

149
00:10:14.063 --> 00:10:16.356
All we have is a jukebox
and a sticker toilet.

150
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.401
d You wanna fly
Don't want your feet on the ground d

151
00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:24.697
d You stay up, you won't come down d

152
00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:28.409
I cannot wait until I'm
old enough to get wasted.

153
00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:31.204
Hey, Jennifer.
You look really pretty.

154
00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:33.289
What up, Craig?

155
00:10:33.374 --> 00:10:36.876
He thinks he's cute enough for me.
And that's why he's in retard math.

156
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.837
Swing and miss.

157
00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:45.259
Hey, it's Ahmet from India,
that foreign exchange guy.

158
00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.136
I wonder if he's circumcised.

159
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:49.764
I always wanted
to try a sea cucumber.

160
00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:52.016
Ew.

161
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:56.063
Jennifer Check. Shouldn't
poison yourself with that shit.

162
00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:00.234
Unless you want me
to arrest ya for possession.

163
00:11:00.318 --> 00:11:04.363
You're gonna arrest me? You're not
even out of the academy yet, Roman.

164
00:11:04.447 --> 00:11:08.367
Two more months.
Then I'm on the force for reals.

165
00:11:09.744 --> 00:11:13.080
Are you, uh—
you're gonna cuff me?

166
00:11:13.164 --> 00:11:14.915
Don't do that.

167
00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:16.959
Okay? Not here.

168
00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:19.670
Hey, that's the band.

169
00:11:28.638 --> 00:11:30.973
Mmm. You can totally tell
they're from the city.

170
00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:34.435
Yeah, 'cause they're wearing eyeliner.
They look like a bunch of faygos.

171
00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:37.771
Well, you would think that, Roman,
because you're a small-time Gomer.

172
00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.524
I wish we had more guys
like that in Devil's Kettle.

173
00:11:40.608 --> 00:11:43.110
All stylish and shit.

174
00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:49.033
I think they need two groupies.

175
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.620
No! No. Come on.
Don't be so J.V., Needy.

176
00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:55.498
They're just boys, morsels.
We have all the power.

177
00:11:55.583 --> 00:11:57.542
Don't you know that?
These things?

178
00:11:57.626 --> 00:12:00.920
These are like
smart bombs. Okay?

179
00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:04.674
You point them in the right
direction, and shit gets real.

180
00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.804
Hi.
Hi.

181
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:14.350
Uh— we just wanted to meet you or something.

182
00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:17.562
I'm Jennifer Check,
and this is my friend.

183
00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:19.772
Hi. I'm Nikolai.

184
00:12:19.857 --> 00:12:22.567
This is, uh—
These guys are my band.

185
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:26.821
Low Shoulder. Yeah, we've
heard— I've heard about you.

186
00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:30.700
You play your instruments
really super good.

187
00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.453
Thank you.
We are professionals.

188
00:12:33.537 --> 00:12:36.873
Hey. Sorry.
Could I ask you a question?

189
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:40.460
Um, why would you wanna play
all the way out here in Devil's Kettle?

190
00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:42.630
You live in the city, right?
Yeah.

191
00:12:42.714 --> 00:12:45.966
But, you know, I think it's really important
sometimes to try and connect with our fans...

192
00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:48.302
in the shitty areas too.

193
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.555
That's amazing.

194
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.725
Can I, um— Can I buy you a drink?

195
00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:56.560
Sure. What are we having?

196
00:12:56.645 --> 00:12:59.855
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter.

197
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.359
It's red, white and blue, but you have to
drink it really fast or it turns brownish.

198
00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.110
All right. Well, we'll drink it fast. Okay.

199
00:13:05.195 --> 00:13:08.239
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

200
00:13:08.323 --> 00:13:10.699
Hey, how- how are you
gonna get alcohol?

201
00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:13.827
Um, I'll just play Hello Titty
with the bartender.

202
00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:20.376
Aw, shit.

203
00:13:24.297 --> 00:13:26.215
Dirk, what about her?

204
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.427
- Who, Jan Brady?
- No, man. Fuck you.

205
00:13:30.512 --> 00:13:33.389
I'm talking about the one who went to get
me a drink. The State Fair Butter Princess.

206
00:13:33.515 --> 00:13:35.517
That's the one. I don't
know. Are you sure she's-

207
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:37.310
Listen, I grew up
in a town like this, okay?

208
00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:41.147
There's always that girl. They love to
show it off, but they do not give it up.

209
00:13:41.232 --> 00:13:43.567
You told us
you were from Brooklyn.

210
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:47.028
My point is, this girl is
definitely a virgin, okay?

211
00:13:47.113 --> 00:13:49.698
- I know girls like that. I've dated chicks—
- I don't know.

212
00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:52.450
Well, we didn't drive
all the way out here for nothing, so—

213
00:13:52.535 --> 00:13:55.161
Fine. Okay? You know,
I'm notjust your bassist.

214
00:13:55.246 --> 00:13:58.498
I'm a person with feelings
who happens to play the bass-

215
00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:00.500
- Excuse me.
- I'd like a little respect around here.

216
00:14:00.585 --> 00:14:04.379
Look, I didn't know
you had feelings. Hey.

217
00:14:04.463 --> 00:14:08.174
Hey. That's my best friend
that you're talking about.

218
00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:10.552
And you're right.
She is a virgin.

219
00:14:10.636 --> 00:14:14.055
And that beats sleeping
with creeps like you.

220
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:28.738
Tower One
isn't full enough.

221
00:14:28.822 --> 00:14:31.115
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

222
00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:34.160
You know what? I think
the lead singer wants me.

223
00:14:34.244 --> 00:14:37.121
Only because he thinks that you're
a virgin. I heard them talking.

224
00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:41.709
What? I'm not even a backdoor
virgin anymore, thanks to Roman.

225
00:14:41.793 --> 00:14:44.128
And by the way, that hurts.

226
00:14:44.212 --> 00:14:46.172
I couldn't even go
to Flags the next day.

227
00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:48.841
I had to stay home and sit
on a bag of frozen peas.

228
00:14:48.967 --> 00:14:51.802
Oh, my God.

229
00:14:53.472 --> 00:14:56.140
Good evening, Devil's Lake.
Devil's Kettle!

230
00:14:56.224 --> 00:14:58.225
Fuckin'- A right, it is.

231
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.311
dd

232
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:20.832

233
00:15:20.917 --> 00:15:23.377

258

dd

259
00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:11.278
Let's go!

260
00:17:13.156 --> 00:17:14.615
No!

261
00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:27.544
Run!

262
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:33.467
We can't get
through there!

263
00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:45.646
I know where to go!

264
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.506
Hey. Hey. Jen?

265
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.638
Hey.

266
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.058
Jennifer? Oh, thank God
you guys are all right.

267
00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.853
I've been looking
everywhere for you two.

268
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.106
Listen, it's really
dangerous out here.

269
00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:32.068
You wanna head someplace
safer, like my van? What?

270
00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:36.614
I'm in survival mode right now,
and I want us to get to a familiar place.

271
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.075
And right now, I feel
like that's my van. Okay.

272
00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:41.160
Okay, this one's
in shock. Great.

273
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.621
Are you in shock?
Have some ofthat.

274
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:45.999
No.

275
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.294
Jennifer?

276
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.797
Hey.

277
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.219
Let's go, Jennifer!
Let's go to the van.

278
00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:00.097
I wanna go to your really cool
van. Needy, let's go see his van.

279
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.099
Why? Why should we?

280
00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:04.268
We have the Sebring.
Let's just get out of here!

281
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:07.062
Let's go to L.O.O. and get some
Northwoods Nachos with extra badger sauce.

282
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.816
- Please? I'm starving.
- Needy, stop it! Just shut up.

283
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.210
I watched her get into that van,

284
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.880
and I knew something awful
was going to happen.

285
00:19:32.964 --> 00:19:34.965
He was skinny
and twisted and evil,

286
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.218
like this petrified tree
I saw when I was a kid.

287
00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:10.460
Oh.

288
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.770
- Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Oh, thank God you're there.

289
00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:31.147
What's wrong?
Jennifer's gone.

290
00:20:31.232 --> 00:20:33.608
She ran offwith that rock band,
and Melody Lane burned down.

291
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.114
You're okay, right?
Uh, yeah.

292
00:20:39.198 --> 00:20:41.534
But there was this huge stampede,

293
00:20:41.618 --> 00:20:43.828
and all the people that fainted
got run over,

294
00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:46.831
and you could hear
their bones breaking.

295
00:20:46.915 --> 00:20:49.250
And the people—

296
00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:52.628
like, the people on fire
just smelled like—

297
00:20:52.754 --> 00:20:55.756
This is crazy. Jennifer's
still with those creeps.

298
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.176
They took her in their spooky van
with the windows all blacked out.

299
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:02.888
- Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist?

300
00:21:02.973 --> 00:21:05.099
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

301
00:21:05.183 --> 00:21:07.309
Who cares aboutJennifer
and those douche bags...

302
00:21:07.394 --> 00:21:09.395
with their douche bag haircuts
and their man-scara?

303
00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:11.564
People just burned to death.

304
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.316
Oh, cheese and fries.
There's somebody here!

305
00:21:14.401 --> 00:21:16.569
I'm all alone.
I'm freaked out.

306
00:21:16.653 --> 00:21:19.321
- Where is your mom?
- Swing shift.

307
00:21:21.658 --> 00:21:24.702
Stay on the phone
with me, okay?

308
00:21:28.206 --> 00:21:30.624
Needy, do you want me
to come over or something?

309
00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:33.045
I don't know. Maybe.

310
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.266
Needy?

311
00:21:52.857 --> 00:21:54.858
Okay, so now
there's no one here.

312
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.612
That's so strange.

313
00:21:58.696 --> 00:22:00.697
Maybe I'm going crazy.

314
00:22:03.201 --> 00:22:05.118
It's probably nothing.

315
00:22:05.203 --> 00:22:07.954
Look, I'll call you later.
Okay.

316
00:23:24.784 --> 00:23:27.703
Hi.

317
00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:38.505
Jen.

318
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.591
What happened?

319
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:52.269
Jen?

320
00:24:16.378 --> 00:24:18.379
Um—

321
00:24:18.464 --> 00:24:23.635
My mom got that at Boston Market,
and I'm— I'm not supposed to-

322
00:24:57.378 --> 00:24:59.295
Jennifer. Jennifer?

323
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:02.590
Jennifer.

324
00:25:27.367 --> 00:25:28.993
Are you scared?

325
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.053
Jennifer!

326
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:05.572
Another body under here!

327
00:26:05.656 --> 00:26:08.992
dd

328
00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.707
I heard Needy and Jennifer
were there,

329
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.710
and they had to fight their
way out with a machete.

330
00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:20.920
Look, she's not
even moving.

331
00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:23.590
It's called post-traumatic
stress disorder.

332
00:26:23.674 --> 00:26:26.509
My dad was in Operation
Enduring Freedom,

333
00:26:26.594 --> 00:26:29.763
and he totally, like, stopped talking
for, like, months.

334
00:26:34.518 --> 00:26:38.313
I'll be Perfect Prom Betty,
and you be her.

335
00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:40.106
Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?

336
00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:42.859
Ow!
What's wrong, Jennifer?

337
00:26:51.703 --> 00:26:54.622
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me a shot.

338
00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:56.707
I never tell on you.

339
00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:02.129
Where's it at, Monistat?

340
00:27:04.257 --> 00:27:07.176
- You're all right.
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

341
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.220
'Cause last night
at my house, you were—

342
00:27:09.304 --> 00:27:11.680
You do have a tendency
to overreact.

343
00:27:11.765 --> 00:27:15.643
Remember when we were in Girl Scout camp,
and you thought that there was an earthquake,

344
00:27:15.727 --> 00:27:18.562
but it was just two guys
with a ghetto blaster?

345
00:27:19.606 --> 00:27:21.816
People died, Jennifer.

346
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.194
It's, like, all over the news.
National news.

347
00:27:27.072 --> 00:27:30.324
Anybody that we know?
We know everyone.

348
00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:34.120
Sucks to be them, I guess.

349
00:27:36.623 --> 00:27:39.959
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

350
00:27:40.043 --> 00:27:42.378
Besides the obvious surface flaws.

351
00:27:44.674 --> 00:27:46.675
I knew it was real.

352
00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:51.847
I'd been up all night,
scrubbing the carnage offthe linoleum.

353
00:27:58.479 --> 00:28:00.105
Shoot.

354
00:28:00.189 --> 00:28:01.857
Please don't talk to yourself.

355
00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:03.984
It's one ofyour more
freakish Needy behaviors...

356
00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:06.445
and it makes us both look
like total gaylords.

357
00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:09.239
Ew. Fuck. You need a mani bad.

358
00:28:09.323 --> 00:28:11.700
You should find a Chinese chick
to buffyour situation.

359
00:28:16.122 --> 00:28:19.833
This is a dark, dark day...

360
00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:21.877
for Devil's Kettle.

361
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:24.713
And believe me you,
I have lived through some—

362
00:28:26.382 --> 00:28:28.383
some pretty heavy stuff.

363
00:28:30.803 --> 00:28:35.265
We lost eight precious students...

364
00:28:35.349 --> 00:28:38.519
including Ahmet from India,

365
00:28:38.604 --> 00:28:41.189
several parents...

366
00:28:41.273 --> 00:28:43.733
and our beloved Spanish teacher,

367
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:47.236
Senorita Erickson.

368
00:28:47.321 --> 00:28:49.238
No way. Erickson ate shit?

369
00:28:49.323 --> 00:28:52.825
Now more than ever,
put aside your teenage concerns...

370
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.330
about who's a cool dude,
or who's a ho.

371
00:28:58.665 --> 00:29:02.168
We can't let that damn fire win.

372
00:29:02.252 --> 00:29:05.046
It already won.

373
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.340
God bless you kids.

374
00:29:30.782 --> 00:29:34.493
There's no band practice today.
There's no anything today.

375
00:29:34.577 --> 00:29:38.997
It's surreal, right? When just one person
dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops.

376
00:29:39.082 --> 00:29:41.583
Feel guiltyjust breathing.

377
00:29:41.668 --> 00:29:44.294
Word.

378
00:29:44.379 --> 00:29:47.381
Chip, I need to tell you
something kinda weird.

379
00:29:49.384 --> 00:29:51.677
It's aboutJennifer.
What?

380
00:29:53.888 --> 00:29:58.141
You know how last night we were talking, and
someone came to my house? It was Jennifer.

381
00:29:58.226 --> 00:30:01.186
She looked like she had been
beaten up or shot or something.

382
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:06.316
And then she barfed up
this, like, disgusting, prickly stuff...

383
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.945
that looked like roadkill and,
like, sewing needles mixed together.

384
00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:11.655
Yuck.

385
00:30:11.739 --> 00:30:15.909
Well, she probably just inhaled a
whole bunch of smoke or something.

386
00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:17.911
No, Chip. No, it was like—

387
00:30:17.996 --> 00:30:20.247
It was, like, evil.

388
00:30:21.624 --> 00:30:24.210
Needy, I think you might wanna
talk to the school shrink.

389
00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:26.087
I'm not saying that
to be a dillhole.

390
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:28.548
Chip, I don't tell whoppers,
and I'm not crazy.

391
00:30:28.632 --> 00:30:30.300
I didn't say you were crazy.

392
00:30:30.384 --> 00:30:33.303
It's just, everybody's a little messed
up about this, and it's okay to feel—

393
00:30:33.429 --> 00:30:36.014
Discombobulated?
Yeah. Fucked up.

394
00:30:36.098 --> 00:30:37.849
Hey, Needy.

395
00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:42.437
- Oh, hi, Colin.
- I heard you were there last night in the fiery trenches.

396
00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:45.732
Yeah.

397
00:30:46.942 --> 00:30:48.901
Well, I'm glad you didn't die.

398
00:30:48.986 --> 00:30:51.988
- Thanks.
- Seriously.

399
00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:57.452
How are you friends
with Colin Gray?

400
00:30:57.536 --> 00:30:59.621
I thought Colin Gray
only talked to the Dead Girls.

401
00:30:59.705 --> 00:31:01.706
I just am. We have
Creative Nonfiction together.

402
00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:05.752
He's a really good writer. He's,
like, all dark and emotional and stuff.

403
00:31:05.836 --> 00:31:10.173
Oh. Well, I'm like that too.
I mean, I can relate.

404
00:31:10.257 --> 00:31:14.260
You know, I'm not all obvious
about it like a poser.

405
00:31:15.346 --> 00:31:17.306
Walk me home?

406
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.476
You know it, babe.

407
00:31:20.644 --> 00:31:22.561
dd

408
00:31:31.404 --> 00:31:36.325
d It's all right d

409
00:31:38.036 --> 00:31:42.081
d It's all right dd

410
00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:48.128
Hi.
Hey, Jennifer.

411
00:31:48.254 --> 00:31:52.299
I'm crazy sorry about
your profound loss.

412
00:31:52.384 --> 00:31:54.635
You are crying about Craig, right?

413
00:31:56.262 --> 00:31:58.597
He was my best friend.

414
00:31:58.682 --> 00:32:01.433
You know, I was there last night,

415
00:32:01.518 --> 00:32:06.105
and I was probably the last person
to talk to him, like, ever.

416
00:32:06.189 --> 00:32:09.191
Wow.
You know what he said?

417
00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:13.530
Craig said that he always
thought you and me...

418
00:32:13.614 --> 00:32:16.908
would make
a totally banging couple.

419
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.954
Isn't that just so weird?

420
00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:23.707
He— He said "banging"?

421
00:32:28.045 --> 00:32:30.338
Feel my heart, Jonas.

422
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.844
I think it's broken.

423
00:32:37.304 --> 00:32:39.681
Mine too.

424
00:32:39.765 --> 00:32:42.809
You come with me,
just for a little while.

425
00:32:43.894 --> 00:32:46.354
It's what Craig would have wanted.

426
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:49.816
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

427
00:33:12.632 --> 00:33:16.010
You're so warm.
Why are you so warm?

428
00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:18.012
Shutties.

429
00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:32.359
Jennifer.

430
00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:35.154
Jen.
What?

431
00:33:35.238 --> 00:33:36.739
Look.

432
00:33:40.869 --> 00:33:42.787
Mm-hmm.

433
00:33:46.833 --> 00:33:48.793
They're waiting.

434
00:33:55.926 --> 00:33:58.303
Okay.

435
00:34:04.894 --> 00:34:10.649
Mmm.

436
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:15.695
Do you miss Craig?

437
00:34:17.657 --> 00:34:20.242
Of course.

438
00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:22.786
Well, you're gonna see
your buddy really soon.

439
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.288
What, you mean,
like, in heaven someday?

440
00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:28.834
Nope.

441
00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:35.423
God.

442
00:34:42.098 --> 00:34:44.057
Let it all out, kids.

443
00:34:53.902 --> 00:34:56.654
dd You want some baloney, Spector?

444
00:34:56.738 --> 00:34:59.448
And that was Low Shoulder,
the local band...

445
00:34:59.533 --> 00:35:03.870
who became unlikely heroes ofthe
tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night.

446
00:35:03.954 --> 00:35:07.832
Eyewitnesses say the boys helped
numerous people escape the inferno,

447
00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:10.543
risking their own lives
in the process.

448
00:35:10.627 --> 00:35:13.796
That's rock and roll with a
conscience, ladies and gentlemen.

449
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:18.259
And guess what. We are honored to have
Low Shoulder in the studio right now.

450
00:35:18.343 --> 00:35:21.012
Now, how you guys holdin' up?

451
00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:23.014
We're maintaining, man.

452
00:35:23.098 --> 00:35:25.308
It's not easy, but,
you know, the real heroes...

453
00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:27.852
are the people
of Devil's Lake.

454
00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:32.732
I just hope we can convey 1/1 Oth
of their courage and spirit...

455
00:35:32.816 --> 00:35:34.859
on our upcoming album.

456
00:35:50.084 --> 00:35:52.127
Virgin mother.

457
00:35:52.253 --> 00:35:54.963
dd
Crap.

458
00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:56.965
You said it.
Hey, Mom.

459
00:35:57.967 --> 00:35:59.968
I didn't know
you were up.

460
00:36:00.053 --> 00:36:01.762
Yeah.

461
00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:06.850
Oh, God. I had another one
of my night terrors.

462
00:36:06.935 --> 00:36:09.519
Well, it's 4:00, so technically
you had a day terror.

463
00:36:09.604 --> 00:36:12.314
Right.

464
00:36:12.398 --> 00:36:15.025
What'd you dream about?

465
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:19.655
I dreamed some bad people were
trying to nail you to a tree...

466
00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:24.076
with hammers
and big stakes and shit.

467
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.579
Just like J.C.

468
00:36:29.457 --> 00:36:33.961
But I didn't let 'em get you, 'cause
I'm a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear.

469
00:36:34.045 --> 00:36:36.839
I can take care of myself.

470
00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:38.841
Yeah, you say that,

471
00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:42.261
but one day you're gonna be crying
out for me, and I'm not gonna be there.

472
00:36:44.264 --> 00:36:47.392
No!

473
00:37:01.407 --> 00:37:04.617
We will get the man who did
this to your son. Hear me.

474
00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:07.787
I'll kill him myself.

475
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:10.623
I will.

476
00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:12.709
Do you hear me, you bastard?

477
00:37:14.378 --> 00:37:18.256
I'll cut offyour nut sack
and nail it to my door...

478
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.011
like one ofthose lion door
knockers rich folks got!

479
00:37:23.095 --> 00:37:26.264
That will be your balls!

480
00:38:17.317 --> 00:38:19.359
Fatalities have grown
in a horrific fire...

481
00:38:19.444 --> 00:38:21.445
that destroyed a popular
local nightclub...

482
00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:22.280
in Devil's Kettle last night.

483
00:38:23.657 --> 00:38:28.661
Yeah?
I feel so scrumptious!

484
00:38:28.788 --> 00:38:31.372
Goody for you. You know when you
kiss a boy for the first time,

485
00:38:31.457 --> 00:38:34.042
and it feels like your
entire body is on vibrate?

486
00:38:35.461 --> 00:38:38.254
- Yeah?
- It's that good.

487
00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:40.256
Well, that's nice.

488
00:38:40.341 --> 00:38:42.592
Me, I'm still a little bit depressed
about, you know,

489
00:38:42.676 --> 00:38:45.094
the giant, smoldering funeral
pyre in the middle oftown.

490
00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:48.306
Move-on-dot-org, Needy.
It's over.

491
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.602
Life is too short to be moping around
about some white-trash pig roast.

492
00:38:52.686 --> 00:38:54.604
That's sweet, Jen.

493
00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:56.397
You know, I tell it like it is.

494
00:38:56.482 --> 00:38:58.233
And besides, you know what?

495
00:38:58.317 --> 00:39:01.444
You should be happy for me
because I am having the best day...

496
00:39:01.529 --> 00:39:04.239
since, like, Jesus invented the calendar.

497
00:39:04.323 --> 00:39:06.366
Jesus didn't invent
the calendar.

498
00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.076
Whatever.

499
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.203
Other line. Hold on.

500
00:39:10.287 --> 00:39:13.373
- So blow it off.
- It'll just be a minute.

501
00:39:13.457 --> 00:39:16.585
Pooh. I'm crossing you out.

502
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.754
Hey.

503
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.091
I need to see you right now.
I can barely hear you.

504
00:39:22.217 --> 00:39:24.426
dd It's because Camille is playing the piano.

505
00:39:24.553 --> 00:39:27.221
Knock it off, Camille!
You knock it off!

506
00:39:27.305 --> 00:39:29.139
Can you meet me
at McCullum in 10?

507
00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:31.267
You knock it off, Chip!
You're a penis cheese!

508
00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:33.310
Uh, 15?

509
00:39:34.646 --> 00:39:37.231
d Heard you're new in town d

510
00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:39.441
d Want someone to show you round d

511
00:39:39.526 --> 00:39:41.902
d Well, no one knows this place
just quite like me dd

512
00:39:41.987 --> 00:39:45.322
- I gotta go.
- I am a god.

513
00:39:45.407 --> 00:39:49.326
Okay. I gotta meet Chip
in McCullum Park.

514
00:39:49.411 --> 00:39:51.996
You know, Chip is looking
really cute to me lately.

515
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.083
So, tell me, is he, uh, like, packing
some serious pubic inches?

516
00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:58.085
What's the story down there?

517
00:39:58.169 --> 00:40:00.421
I gotta go.

518
00:40:07.512 --> 00:40:09.472
Why are the cops
at your house?

519
00:40:09.557 --> 00:40:12.058
They're not. They're
atJonas Kozelle's house.

520
00:40:12.184 --> 00:40:16.062
Why? He try to sell fake peyote to the eighth
graders again? No, Needy. He was murdered.

521
00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:17.689
What?
Yeah.

522
00:40:17.773 --> 00:40:20.191
Someone ripped Jonas limb from
limb in the woods behind school.

523
00:40:20.276 --> 00:40:22.152
They ate parts of him.

524
00:40:22.278 --> 00:40:25.614
No one's even supposed to know yet, but my dad
just went over there and talked to the cops.

525
00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:27.616
His mom is, like, catatonic.

526
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.828
She's just staring out the front window
like a zombie mannequin robot statue.

527
00:40:35.082 --> 00:40:37.834
This can't
be a coincidence.

528
00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:40.045
What are you
talking about, Needy?

529
00:40:40.129 --> 00:40:41.588
A fiery death trap
last night,

530
00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:43.924
and now a cannibal psycho takes
down the biggest guy in school?

531
00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:45.008
Come on.
It's freaktarded.

532
00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:50.680
Well, the bad luck's
gotta be over, right?

533
00:40:50.765 --> 00:40:53.725
I mean, it can't get any worse,
right? It can't.

534
00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:55.894
I mean, you agree, right?

535
00:40:55.978 --> 00:40:57.896
You're shaking.

536
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.482
Well, I'm cold.
It's very cold out here.

537
00:41:00.566 --> 00:41:02.860
You want my hoodie?

538
00:41:04.154 --> 00:41:07.406
d All alone in an empty room d

539
00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:10.242
The days marched on as usual,

540
00:41:10.327 --> 00:41:13.496
but most of us were too numb
to enjoy ourselves.

541
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.498
Most of us.

542
00:41:15.582 --> 00:41:18.584
d And I don't know
how we ended up here d

543
00:41:18.669 --> 00:41:23.381
d I don't know
but it's never been so clear d

544
00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:28.177
d We made a mistake, dear d

545
00:41:28.261 --> 00:41:32.056
To the rest ofthe world,
we were famous. We were saints.

546
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.266
Our town's only bar
had burned to the ground,

547
00:41:34.351 --> 00:41:38.020
and our star linebacker
was someone's Snack Pack.

548
00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:41.524
The whole country got a huge
tragedy boner for Devil's Kettle.

549
00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:46.070
And the press, God! They couldn't get
enough of our little world of shit.

550
00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:51.242
d Through the trees d

551
00:41:51.326 --> 00:41:54.705
d I will find you d

552
00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:58.417
d I will heal d

553
00:41:58.501 --> 00:42:02.045
d The ruins left inside you d

554
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.882
d 'Cause I'm still here breathing now d

555
00:42:05.967 --> 00:42:13.098
d I'm still here breathing now d

556
00:42:13.182 --> 00:42:16.476
d Until I'm set free d

557
00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:20.063
d Go quiet through the trees dd

558
00:42:20.148 --> 00:42:22.649
Still, we were healing.

559
00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:25.777
Like Chip, we figured things
could only get better. Hey!

560
00:42:26.779 --> 00:42:28.697
We had faith.

561
00:42:29.824 --> 00:42:31.908
We were fucking idiots.

562
00:42:33.286 --> 00:42:36.288
Before the period ends,
I'd like to make an announcement.

563
00:42:37.582 --> 00:42:40.417
As you all know, today is
the one month anniversary...

564
00:42:40.501 --> 00:42:43.754
ofthe tragedy
at Melody Lane...

565
00:42:43.838 --> 00:42:46.465
and the murder ofJonas Kozelle.

566
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:48.301
Boring.
Jesus!

567
00:42:48.385 --> 00:42:50.428
What a bitch.

568
00:42:50.512 --> 00:42:52.722
As I was saying,
Jennifer and Needy,

569
00:42:52.806 --> 00:42:55.808
I finally have some good news
to share with all ofyou.

570
00:42:55.893 --> 00:42:58.853
The members ofthe rock and roll
group Low Shoulder...

571
00:42:58.937 --> 00:43:02.523
have decided to extend a
helping hand to our community.

572
00:43:02.608 --> 00:43:06.694
As you all know, their song,
"Through The Trees,"

573
00:43:06.779 --> 00:43:09.280
has become our unofficial anthem...

574
00:43:09.406 --> 00:43:12.200
of unity and healing.

575
00:43:12.284 --> 00:43:14.786
And they have decided
to release it as a benefit single.

576
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.789
Three percent ofthe profits
will go to local families...

577
00:43:17.873 --> 00:43:19.791
who have been affected by loss.

578
00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:21.834
What about the other 97%?

579
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.838
I mean, that's just crass, right?

580
00:43:27.633 --> 00:43:31.803
"Crass. " It means greedy,
exploitative, scummy.

581
00:43:31.887 --> 00:43:33.888
Low Shoulder
are American heroes.

582
00:43:33.972 --> 00:43:37.016
No, they're not!
I was there, Chastity.

583
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:39.310
They didn't help anybody
escape the fire.

584
00:43:39.394 --> 00:43:41.980
I don't even know how
that rumor got started.

585
00:43:42.065 --> 00:43:44.233
Rumor? Rumor?

586
00:43:44.317 --> 00:43:47.528
It's true.
It's on the Wikipedia.

587
00:43:47.612 --> 00:43:51.949
We wouldn't even know who they were
ifthey hadn't been playing that night.

588
00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:54.701
- They used us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki.

589
00:43:54.786 --> 00:43:57.121
- Girls—
- We need them now more than ever.

590
00:43:57.205 --> 00:44:00.415
That's enough.

591
00:44:02.627 --> 00:44:05.003
I'm already sick ofthat song.

592
00:44:05.088 --> 00:44:07.381
Yeah, it's really poorly produced.

593
00:44:07.465 --> 00:44:09.466
Could the bass
be any lower in the mix?

594
00:44:09.551 --> 00:44:12.636
No offense, but you
look really tired.

595
00:44:12.762 --> 00:44:16.598
Is everything okay?
No. I feel like boo-boo.

596
00:44:16.683 --> 00:44:21.478
My skin is breaking out,
and my hair is dull and lifeless.

597
00:44:21.563 --> 00:44:25.399
God. It's like I'm one
ofthe normal girls.

598
00:44:25.525 --> 00:44:28.819
Are you P.M.S.
- ing or something'? P.M.S. isn't real, Needy.

599
00:44:28.903 --> 00:44:32.114
It was invented by the boy-run
media to make us seem crazy.

600
00:44:34.034 --> 00:44:36.119
Don't look at me like that!

601
00:44:37.997 --> 00:44:39.956
It's just wearing off
or something.

602
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.624
What's wearing off?

603
00:44:44.962 --> 00:44:47.005
Hello, Needy.
Hi.

604
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:49.966
Jennifer.
Hi, Colin.

605
00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.386
Can I borrow your English homework
again? I forgot to read Hamlet.

606
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.639
Is he gonna fuck his mom?

607
00:44:56.724 --> 00:44:59.142
No— I don't— I don't—
I don't think so.

608
00:44:59.226 --> 00:45:02.020
Um, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

609
00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:04.564
You wanna know if I'll go out with you? No!

610
00:45:04.648 --> 00:45:07.734
Yeah. What? I—

611
00:45:07.818 --> 00:45:11.321
- I don't g— How'd you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

612
00:45:13.657 --> 00:45:16.409
Okay. Um—

613
00:45:16.493 --> 00:45:19.871
Well, we've been having
a lot of fun in class, you and I,

614
00:45:19.955 --> 00:45:24.334
and I thought that maybe you'd
like to go see a movie or something.

615
00:45:24.418 --> 00:45:28.255
There's a, uh, midnight showing of
Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend.

616
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.507
I don't like boxing movies.

617
00:45:31.927 --> 00:45:37.348
Yeah, but it's no—
It's not a... fucking boxing movie.

618
00:45:37.432 --> 00:45:39.725
Um, fuck it.
Okay. Forget it.

619
00:45:42.854 --> 00:45:46.023
- That was random.
- I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

620
00:45:48.318 --> 00:45:50.236
Colin's really nice.

621
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.863
He's into maggot rock.
He wears nail polish.

622
00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:56.700
My dick is bigger than his.
I think he's really cool.

623
00:45:56.826 --> 00:45:58.786
You do?
Yeah.

624
00:46:06.002 --> 00:46:08.712
Wait. Colin.

625
00:46:09.923 --> 00:46:12.508
Why don't you just come by
my place tonight?

626
00:46:12.592 --> 00:46:16.762
I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's
about this girl who's, like, half-sushi.

627
00:46:16.846 --> 00:46:19.515
I guess she has sex through
her blowhole or something.

628
00:46:21.143 --> 00:46:23.311
Okay.

629
00:46:23.396 --> 00:46:26.398
Great, yeah.

630
00:46:26.482 --> 00:46:28.858
Okay. I'll text you
my address.

631
00:46:30.278 --> 00:46:32.195
Cool.

632
00:46:34.865 --> 00:46:36.825
Hi.
Hey.

633
00:46:38.411 --> 00:46:41.496
Mmm. Hi, Chip.

634
00:46:41.622 --> 00:46:44.833
Hey, hey.
Ugh.

635
00:46:44.917 --> 00:46:47.669
Get a room.

636
00:46:47.753 --> 00:46:50.297
So, talking to your mysterious
pal Colin Gray again.

637
00:46:50.423 --> 00:46:53.341
No. He was asking Jennifer
out on a date. That's weird.

638
00:46:55.678 --> 00:46:58.638
So are you gonna come over
tonight? Sure, I'd like that.

639
00:46:58.723 --> 00:47:01.933
I went to SuperTarget
and picked up more condoms, so—

640
00:47:02.059 --> 00:47:03.852
Thanks. Not that that has anything to do with—

641
00:47:03.978 --> 00:47:07.480
Oh, no, I didn't assume that.
Well, I'm—

642
00:47:07.565 --> 00:47:10.066
Okay. I'll see you tonight then.

643
00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:13.070

00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:30.540
Yeah, it's, uh, supposed to
make it feel good for the girl.

You made it.

690
00:52:21.384 --> 00:52:24.053
What's going on?

691
00:52:29.267 --> 00:52:31.268
This, uh—

692
00:52:32.521 --> 00:52:34.939
This isn't really your house, is it?

693
00:52:35.941 --> 00:52:37.859
No, baby.

694
00:52:37.943 --> 00:52:41.196
This is our house,
just for you and me.

695
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.492
We can play Mommy and Daddy.

696
00:52:53.876 --> 00:52:56.586
Do you even know my last name?

697
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.089
Silly.

698
00:52:59.173 --> 00:53:01.841
I've been sending you
signals all year.

699
00:53:03.052 --> 00:53:05.470
Couldn't you tell?

700
00:53:05.554 --> 00:53:07.847
You give me such a wettie.

701
00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:28.035
Put it in.

702
00:53:48.473 --> 00:53:51.100
Jennifer!

703
00:53:52.144 --> 00:53:54.770
What? Are you scared?

704
00:53:54.855 --> 00:53:58.983
I thought boys like you were really
into vermin and death and shit.

705
00:53:59.109 --> 00:54:02.278
Here you go.

706
00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:07.700
Nice hardware, ace.

707
00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.437
No way.

708
00:54:41.819 --> 00:54:44.070
Ow! Shit!
Ooh! Puncture wound.

709
00:54:44.155 --> 00:54:46.198
God, that's so emo.

710
00:54:51.204 --> 00:54:53.455
I need you frightened.

711
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:27.406
I need you hopeless.

712
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.872
Hopeless.

713
00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:46.259
Hopeless.

714
00:55:54.434 --> 00:55:57.937
What? What?

715
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.022
What?

716
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:03.025
Am I hurting you?

717
00:56:06.322 --> 00:56:08.574
Am I too big?

718
00:56:12.453 --> 00:56:14.246
What?

719
00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:20.127
Needy. What's wrong?

720
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:22.296
Is it something I did?

721
00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:55.037
d Through the trees d

722
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:58.333
d I will— d

723
00:58:10.365 --> 00:58:12.700
Mommy? Mommy!

724
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:30.779
Hi.

725
00:59:30.863 --> 00:59:34.574
- God, Needy,
enough with the screaming!

726
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.161
You're such a cliché.
Get out!

727
00:59:38.747 --> 00:59:42.458
But we always share your bed
when we have slumber parties.

728
00:59:47.672 --> 00:59:50.299
I'm not gonna bite you.

729
00:59:58.975 --> 01:00:01.560
Is that
my Evil Dead T-shirt?

730
01:01:09.088 --> 01:01:11.006
What the fuck is happening?

731
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:12.924
My God, Needy.

732
01:01:13.009 --> 01:01:15.927
I have never heard you
drop the F-bomb before.

733
01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:19.180
I saw you!
I saw— I saw— I saw the—

734
01:01:19.265 --> 01:01:22.142
Slow down, tardy slip.
You sound like a sped.

735
01:01:22.268 --> 01:01:24.562
I'm gonna call the police. Okay.

736
01:01:24.646 --> 01:01:26.689
Why don't you
narc me out?

737
01:01:26.773 --> 01:01:29.025
I have the cops
in my back pocket, Needy.

738
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:30.943
I'm fucking a cadet.
Remember?

739
01:01:32.362 --> 01:01:34.280
What do you want from me?

740
01:01:34.364 --> 01:01:37.617
Just want to explain
some things to you.

741
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:40.620
Besides, best friends
don't keep secrets.

742
01:01:40.704 --> 01:01:42.371
Right?

743
01:01:44.082 --> 01:01:47.668
So, you remember the night ofthe
fire? I got really messed up.

744
01:01:47.753 --> 01:01:51.547
And those guys from Low Shoulder
- totally evil.

745
01:01:51.632 --> 01:01:54.550
They're basically,
like, agents of Satan...

746
01:01:54.635 --> 01:01:56.552
with really awesome haircuts.

747
01:01:56.637 --> 01:01:59.639
dd

748
01:02:05.437 --> 01:02:07.063
Where- Where are we going?

749
01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:09.398
You don't have to talk
ifyou don't want to.

750
01:02:09.483 --> 01:02:13.736
d All right, dear
Have a nice year d

751
01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.490
d Teach the mean girls d

752
01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:18.575
d How to be feared d

753
01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.661
Are you guys rapists?

754
01:02:20.745 --> 01:02:23.413
- dd
- Oh, God, I hate girls.

755
01:02:24.832 --> 01:02:27.626
d You could be satisfied d

756
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.464
Are you even sure
if she's a fucking virgin, man?

757
01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.467
Yes. Yes, I'm a virgin.
I'm a virgin.

758
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:38.470
I've never even done sex.
I don't know how.

759
01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:42.391
So you guys should find
somebody who does...

760
01:02:42.475 --> 01:02:44.393
know how.

761
01:02:44.477 --> 01:02:47.938
See, Dirk? I told you, man.
You owe me a beer.

762
01:02:48.022 --> 01:02:51.024
- What did they do to you?
- Just let me finish.

763
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:54.027
dd
So they drove me out to the falls...

764
01:02:54.112 --> 01:02:59.658
and I kept looking for a way to escape,
but it's really dark out there.

765
01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:09.502
Where are you going? Huh?

766
01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:13.965
We got a waxing moon tonight,
you guys, just like the ritual says.

767
01:03:14.049 --> 01:03:15.925
Please!

768
01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:21.222
No! Please!

769
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:25.476
Please!

770
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:28.479
Do one ofyou guys have
something to shut her up with?

771
01:03:32.484 --> 01:03:36.654
Great. But get it nice and tight, though,
'cause I don't wanna get fuckin' clawed.

772
01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:49.042
I don't know ifwe should
go through with this.

773
01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:51.711
Dirk.

774
01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:56.674
Do you wanna work at Moose Hoof
Coffee forever? I don't, okay?

775
01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:58.551
Do you wanna be
a big loser, or...

776
01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.637
do you wanna be
rich and awesome...

777
01:04:01.722 --> 01:04:04.600
like that guy from Maroon 5?

778
01:04:06.102 --> 01:04:07.853
Maroon 5.

779
01:04:07.937 --> 01:04:10.064
Okay.
That's what I thought.

780
01:04:10.148 --> 01:04:12.483
Go and fetch me
the ritual, brother.

781
01:04:13.526 --> 01:04:16.570
Okay.
What the fuck?

782
01:04:20.241 --> 01:04:22.367
Thank you.

783
01:04:22.452 --> 01:04:24.787
- All right.
- That's it?

784
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:27.790
Yeah. I found it online.

785
01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:32.419
"We come here tonight
to sacrifice the body of"—

786
01:04:35.048 --> 01:04:36.924
What is your name again?
Tiffany?

787
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:39.635
My name is Jennifer.
Super.

788
01:04:39.719 --> 01:04:43.972
"We come here tonight to sacrifice the
body of Jennifer from Devil's Kettle. "

789
01:04:44.057 --> 01:04:46.767
Please, please.
Please, please, don't do this.

790
01:04:46.851 --> 01:04:50.562
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything you want.

791
01:04:56.946 --> 01:04:59.989
Do you know how hard it is
to make it as an indie band these days?

792
01:05:00.074 --> 01:05:03.409
There's so many of us,
and we're all so cute...

793
01:05:03.494 --> 01:05:06.079
and it's like,
ifyou don't get on Letterman...

794
01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:09.916
or some retarded soundtrack,
you're screwed, okay?

795
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.627
Satan is our only hope.

796
01:05:12.711 --> 01:05:16.047
We're in league with the beast now, and we
have to make a really big impression on him.

797
01:05:16.131 --> 01:05:19.634
And to do that, we're going to have
to butcher you and bleed you.

798
01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:22.011
And then Dirk here's
gonna wear your face.

799
01:05:22.096 --> 01:05:25.014
Relax. I'm kidding about the face.
The rest is gonna happen though.

800
01:05:25.099 --> 01:05:27.517
Why don't you just get a
publicist? We can make T-shirts.

801
01:05:27.601 --> 01:05:30.103
I could be a part
ofyour street scene. Please.

802
01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:31.938
Sorry. No can do.

803
01:05:32.022 --> 01:05:36.734
But you know what? Maybe we'll write a song
about you. As a fan, that'd be cool, right?

804
01:05:44.577 --> 01:05:47.662
No! No!
With the deepest malice,

805
01:05:47.746 --> 01:05:50.541
we deliver this virgin
unto thee.

806
01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:53.711
Dude, that is a hot murder
weapon. It's a bowie knife.

807
01:05:53.795 --> 01:05:55.254
Bowie? Nice.

808
01:05:55.338 --> 01:05:59.049
- Here we go! It's gonna be gnarly!
- No, please, please!

809
01:05:59.175 --> 01:06:02.553
No, please, God! Wait a second.
I just thought of something.

810
01:06:02.637 --> 01:06:06.056
Jenny, Jenny,
you're the girl for me.

811
01:06:06.141 --> 01:06:07.892
You don't know me,
but you make me so happy.

812
01:06:07.976 --> 01:06:11.395
I tried to call you before,
but I lost my nerve.

813
01:06:11.479 --> 01:06:14.148
d I used my imagination d

814
01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:16.984
d But I was disturbed d

815
01:06:17.068 --> 01:06:20.654
dJenny, I got your number d

816
01:06:20.739 --> 01:06:23.866
d I need to make you mine d

817
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.077
dJenny, don't change your number d

818
01:06:27.162 --> 01:06:35.085
d 867-5309 d

819
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:38.756
d 867-5309 dd

820
01:06:45.932 --> 01:06:47.807
They killed you.

821
01:06:47.892 --> 01:06:49.809
I'm still here, aren't I?

822
01:06:49.894 --> 01:06:54.105
They did go all Benihana on my ass with
that knife and it should have killed me,

823
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:58.193
but for some reason it didn't.

824
01:07:00.738 --> 01:07:02.656
Maybe it did.

825
01:07:29.308 --> 01:07:32.477
Anyway, I don't really remember
what happened after that.

826
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:37.316
I just know that I woke up
and I found my way back to you.

827
01:07:49.454 --> 01:07:50.997
I remember.

828
01:07:51.999 --> 01:07:54.583
I couldn't bring myself
to hurt you.

829
01:07:54.668 --> 01:07:57.211
I mean,
I'm a really good friend,

830
01:07:58.213 --> 01:08:01.173
but I was just so hungry.

831
01:08:20.652 --> 01:08:22.028
Ahmet.

832
01:08:23.613 --> 01:08:26.157
You made it out.

833
01:08:29.495 --> 01:08:31.121
Are you lost?

834
01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:36.877
Does your host family
know you're alive?

835
01:08:40.339 --> 01:08:43.341
Does anyone know you're alive?

836
01:08:48.723 --> 01:08:50.766
You come with me.

837
01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.893
We're gonna sort
all this out, okay?

838
01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:58.732
And ever since then, I just knew
what I had to do to be strong.

839
01:08:58.816 --> 01:09:01.193
And when I'm full,
like I am right now,

840
01:09:01.277 --> 01:09:04.362
I'm, like, unkillable.

841
01:09:04.489 --> 01:09:07.824
Like, I can do shit
like this. Watch.

842
01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:12.913
It's really cool. Just watch. Look.

843
01:09:14.373 --> 01:09:17.876
It's, like, some X-Men shit, right?

844
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:27.553
What do you mean, when you're full?

845
01:09:30.474 --> 01:09:35.686
What about my mom's Kia?
Why were you covered in blood?

846
01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:38.022
You didn't even look human.

847
01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:44.403
You know, Needy, maybe you should
talk to somebody about these...

848
01:09:44.488 --> 01:09:48.157
disturbing thoughts
that you're having.

849
01:09:48.242 --> 01:09:50.201
We're all really concerned.

850
01:09:51.495 --> 01:09:52.870
Especially Chip.

851
01:09:54.206 --> 01:09:56.874
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

852
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.919
Leave. Come on, Needy. Let me stay the night.

853
01:10:00.003 --> 01:10:03.631
We can play boyfriend-girlfriend
like we used to.

854
01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:21.775
What are you doing?
Um, you said to leave.

855
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.610
See you at school.

856
01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:54.016
We are gathered here
to celebrate the life of Colin Gray,

857
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.019
who was plucked
from the prime of his youth—

858
01:10:57.103 --> 01:10:59.229
Colin!

859
01:10:59.314 --> 01:11:02.024
Take me with you!

860
01:11:02.108 --> 01:11:06.028
I belong down there...
in the darkness!

861
01:11:06.112 --> 01:11:09.908
No, Kevin. Those are just his earthly remains.

862
01:11:09.992 --> 01:11:13.536
He's among the dark angels ofthe realm now.

863
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:16.122
Fly, Colin.
Fly into the firmament.

864
01:11:25.216 --> 01:11:27.467
Colin wouldn't like this.

865
01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:29.469
You think so?

866
01:11:29.553 --> 01:11:31.179
Yeah, you're right.

867
01:11:31.263 --> 01:11:36.476
I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have
liked being eaten by a fucking cannibal...

868
01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.436
and buried
before his 18th birthday.

869
01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:43.274
Wow. You must have known him so well. Jill.

870
01:11:43.359 --> 01:11:47.362
By the time they found Colin
in that godforsaken house,

871
01:11:47.446 --> 01:11:50.531
he looked like lasagna with teeth.

872
01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:54.244
I'd know.
I had to identify the remains.

873
01:11:54.328 --> 01:11:55.787
My boy...

874
01:11:55.871 --> 01:11:58.998
is not in the realm ofthe undead.

875
01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:02.836
He is not flying around
in the firmament...

876
01:12:02.921 --> 01:12:05.256
on magical wings of flame.

877
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.426
He's in an overpriced rosewood box...

878
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:12.846
that's headed six feet downtown.

879
01:12:17.018 --> 01:12:18.852
So...

880
01:12:18.937 --> 01:12:21.188
you can take your pain...

881
01:12:21.273 --> 01:12:25.442
and you can shove it
up your asses, kids.

882
01:12:26.444 --> 01:12:29.196
I got the monopoly on pain.

883
01:12:42.794 --> 01:12:47.131
They did a big memorial assembly
for Colin at school.

884
01:12:47.257 --> 01:12:50.718
And we had to watch another presentation
about curfews and the buddy system...

885
01:12:50.802 --> 01:12:53.512
and how to deal with grief.

886
01:12:53.597 --> 01:12:56.599
But nobody seemed
to care anymore.

887
01:12:56.684 --> 01:12:59.185
Sorrow was last week's emotion.

888
01:13:01.314 --> 01:13:04.524
Sure, we all hoped
this would be the last funeral,

889
01:13:04.608 --> 01:13:06.901
but I knew better.

890
01:13:06.986 --> 01:13:09.529
So I did some research.

891
01:13:09.613 --> 01:13:11.281
Paranormal research.

892
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:27.380
"Offering a virgin to Satan. "

893
01:13:28.424 --> 01:13:30.467
"Ifthe sacrifice is impure-

894
01:13:31.427 --> 01:13:33.678
Human and demonic relations"—

895
01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:36.931
"Destroying a demon.

896
01:13:37.016 --> 01:13:39.601
"Demons are weakest when hungry,

897
01:13:39.685 --> 01:13:43.396
but a blade to the heart
is the surest way to kill the beast. "

898
01:13:49.154 --> 01:13:52.656
Jennifer and I hadn't spoken
since our encounter in my room.

899
01:13:53.825 --> 01:13:57.244
Actually, I hadn't really
spoken to anyone.

900
01:14:14.346 --> 01:14:15.888
Hey.

901
01:14:16.932 --> 01:14:18.891
Just bought our formal tickets.

902
01:14:18.975 --> 01:14:20.893
Did you make reservations
at the Cheesecake Factory?

903
01:14:23.438 --> 01:14:25.815
Chip, I can't go
to the dance with you.

904
01:14:25.899 --> 01:14:27.358
What? Why?

905
01:14:27.442 --> 01:14:30.861
Look, just trust me.
You shouldn't go at all.

906
01:14:30.987 --> 01:14:33.322
What are you talking about?
Not here.

907
01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:36.325
What's going on?
You're breaking up with me?

908
01:14:36.409 --> 01:14:38.494
Please, Chip! I just need
to show you something.

909
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.205
Is this aboutJennifer?
Yes!

910
01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:43.875
But I promise you this is the last
thing— Needy, I care about you. A lot.

911
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.171
As a person, not just some girl I made
love to for four minutes the other night.

912
01:14:48.256 --> 01:14:51.842
And I'm scared ofwhat's happening to
you. You're acting really fucked up.

913
01:14:51.926 --> 01:14:54.636
Please just let me show you.

914
01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.597
Okay.

915
01:14:57.682 --> 01:14:59.891
Jennifer's evil.

916
01:14:59.976 --> 01:15:01.935
I know.

917
01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:04.563
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

918
01:15:04.647 --> 01:15:06.106
Not high-school evil.

919
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:10.235
I've been through the occult
section at the library five times.

920
01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:12.571
Our library
has an occult section?

921
01:15:12.655 --> 01:15:15.240
Yeah, it's um— it's really small.

922
01:15:15.324 --> 01:15:18.160
Uh, you have to read this.

923
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:22.205
"Demoni"—
"Demonic transference. "

924
01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:25.709
It's something that happens when you
try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan...

925
01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:27.127
without using an actual virgin.

926
01:15:27.211 --> 01:15:30.213
The guys in the band tried to
sacrifice her in the woods.

927
01:15:30.298 --> 01:15:33.259
But what they didn't know is that she
hasn't been a virgin since junior high.

928
01:15:33.343 --> 01:15:35.178
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

929
01:15:35.262 --> 01:15:38.264
"If the human sacrifice is impure,
the result may still be attained,

930
01:15:38.348 --> 01:15:40.725
"but the demon will forever reside
in the soul ofthe victim.

931
01:15:40.809 --> 01:15:43.603
She must forever feed on flesh
to sustain the demon. "

932
01:15:43.687 --> 01:15:45.938
- Okay.
- She's eating boys!

933
01:15:46.023 --> 01:15:49.317
They, like, make her
really pretty and glowy...

934
01:15:49.401 --> 01:15:51.194
and her hair looks amazing.

935
01:15:51.278 --> 01:15:54.405
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

936
01:15:54.489 --> 01:15:56.908
I mean, like, ugly for her.

937
01:15:56.992 --> 01:15:58.826
Don't you get it?

938
01:15:58.911 --> 01:16:00.411
The dance.

939
01:16:00.495 --> 01:16:03.539
It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

940
01:16:06.752 --> 01:16:08.794
Needy, I think you need help.

941
01:16:08.879 --> 01:16:11.380
Oh, my God. You don't believe me.

942
01:16:11.465 --> 01:16:14.759
It's not that I don't believe you.
I just don't believe this.

943
01:16:14.843 --> 01:16:16.928
God! This is a nightmare!

944
01:16:18.889 --> 01:16:21.307
Well, what about the dance?

945
01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:23.726
Who cares about
the goddanged dance, Chip?

946
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:26.271
I do. I ordered your corsage.

947
01:16:26.356 --> 01:16:29.566
It's an orchid. It was, like, $12.

948
01:16:32.195 --> 01:16:36.240
I'll be at the dance.
I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer.

949
01:16:36.324 --> 01:16:39.076
Promise me you're not gonna go.

950
01:16:41.913 --> 01:16:45.499
Needy, I—
I'm not your guy anymore?

951
01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:48.794
Chip, it's not safe for us
to be together right now.

952
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.803
d You hit me once
I hit you back d

953
01:16:57.887 --> 01:16:59.972

All over Devil's Kettle,

964
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.126
kids were getting ready for the dance,

965
01:17:29.628 --> 01:17:31.462
blissfully ignorant
that some poor chump...

966
01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:34.632
was on his way to being Satan Chow.

967
01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:38.177

I need to give you something.

What, Mom?

971
01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.442
Ladies' pepper spray?

972
01:17:52.526 --> 01:17:55.862
There's obviously
a sicko out there who likes boys.

973
01:17:55.946 --> 01:18:00.491
Mom, I can take care of myself.
I've been using the Bowflex.

974
01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:04.203
Did you hear what Colin Gray
looked like when they found him?

975
01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:06.956
Lasagna with teeth?
You heard.

976
01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:09.250

977
01:18:09.335 --> 01:18:12.504
You picking Needy up
at her house?

978
01:18:14.883 --> 01:18:18.302
Um, I'm meeting her
at the dance.

979
01:18:18.386 --> 01:18:21.305
I want pictures with your sister
before you go.

980
01:18:21.389 --> 01:18:23.015
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:27.354 --> 01:18:30.147

Everything
I once believed in.

993
01:19:32.711 --> 01:19:34.754
Your abortion.

994
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.049

hate your guts, Madison.

Uh, boys? Thank you.

1006
01:20:53.336 --> 01:20:56.922
Didn't you hear me
calling your name?

1007
01:20:57.006 --> 01:20:59.174
You weren't
calling my name.

1008
01:20:59.258 --> 01:21:00.967
Yes, I was.

1009
01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:04.387
I- I couldn't hear it.

1010
01:21:04.472 --> 01:21:08.642
Listen, I need to talk
to you about you-know-who.

1011
01:21:08.726 --> 01:21:10.644
Our little Needy.

1012
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:12.646
Yeah, she— I mean, are you worried?

1013
01:21:12.730 --> 01:21:15.440
Because I am
super stressed about her.

1014
01:21:15.525 --> 01:21:18.610
Welcome
to the Spring Formal!

1015
01:21:21.864 --> 01:21:25.575
She's been acting
a little off lately.

1016
01:21:28.204 --> 01:21:32.249
Look, I think I know
what's wrong with her.

1017
01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:34.793
What? What is it?

1018
01:21:34.877 --> 01:21:38.880
You know how Needy has been
really upset since Colin Gray died?

1019
01:21:38.965 --> 01:21:40.632
Mm-hmm.

1020
01:21:40.716 --> 01:21:45.179
Well, it's notjust because he was,
like, brutally murdered and stuff.

1021
01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:47.848
I don't wanna say this!
Say it.

1022
01:21:48.892 --> 01:21:50.810
I hope everybody
has had an opportunity...

1023
01:21:50.894 --> 01:21:54.438
to consume some of the pecan
sandies and Cran-Grape...

1024
01:21:54.523 --> 01:21:57.400
that were so generously donated
by the parents club.

1025
01:21:57.526 --> 01:21:59.527
Yeah!

1026
01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:03.364
Needy and Colin
were intimate.

1027
01:22:04.575 --> 01:22:06.492
And by that...

1028
01:22:06.577 --> 01:22:09.954
I mean they were porking
on a semi-regular basis.

1029
01:22:10.038 --> 01:22:12.206
No.

1030
01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:16.002
She and Colin were doing things
that you have never even heard of.

1031
01:22:16.086 --> 01:22:18.087
Okay?
Total varsity moves.

1032
01:22:23.051 --> 01:22:26.637
But the real treat
is yet to come.

1033
01:22:26.722 --> 01:22:29.015
We have some special guests
this evening.

1034
01:22:29.099 --> 01:22:32.935
I just can't believe that she would
mess with your head like this.

1035
01:22:33.979 --> 01:22:37.440
I care about you
so much, Chip.

1036
01:22:40.903 --> 01:22:44.031
More than I've ever
had the guts to admit.

1037
01:22:45.575 --> 01:22:47.826
These fine young gentlemen...

1038
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:50.329
have been generous enough
to take time out...

1039
01:22:50.413 --> 01:22:53.832
from their sold-out national tour...

1040
01:22:53.916 --> 01:22:57.919
to play our dance
for free.

1041
01:23:00.757 --> 01:23:03.759
Needy didn't deserve
a boy like you.

1042
01:23:03.843 --> 01:23:07.429
Boys and girls,
please welcome...

1043
01:23:07.513 --> 01:23:10.474
Low Shoulder!

1044
01:23:45.803 --> 01:23:48.930

1045
01:23:49.014 --> 01:23:52.016

1046

1048

Oh, you're so salty.

1049
01:23:59.608 --> 01:24:03.069
Yeah, you're... salty too.

1050
01:24:03.153 --> 01:24:04.946
Say it like you mean it.

1051
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.156
Say I'm better than Needy.

1052
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:08.825
What? Why?

1053
01:24:15.958 --> 01:24:19.001

1072
01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:30.492
Hi, Camille. Hey!
Is Chipper home?

1073
01:25:30.576 --> 01:25:33.203
- Needy, is something wrong?
- Where's Chip?

1074
01:25:33.287 --> 01:25:36.623
- He left for the dance at least 20 minutes ago.
- He walked?

1075
01:25:36.707 --> 01:25:39.501
It's only five blocks.
My God, your hair is-

1076
01:25:39.585 --> 01:25:43.296
- Which way did he go?
- He usually cuts across the park.

1077
01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:46.633
Camille, sit like a lady!
No one wants to see your kiki!

1078
01:25:46.717 --> 01:25:48.551
Why don't you try-

1079
01:25:48.636 --> 01:25:50.595
Anita?

1080
01:26:10.992 --> 01:26:12.910
Mmm.

1081
01:26:18.583 --> 01:26:20.292
What are you doing?

1082
01:26:20.418 --> 01:26:22.211
Swimming.

1083
01:26:22.295 --> 01:26:24.004
Ha-ha.

1084
01:26:24.089 --> 01:26:25.881
Come on, Chip.

1085
01:26:25.966 --> 01:26:28.968
Show me your breast stroke.

1086
01:26:43.316 --> 01:26:45.526
I feel so empty.

1087
01:26:50.448 --> 01:26:52.366
Yeah, me too.

1088
01:26:54.244 --> 01:26:57.329
Why don't you just come here
and kiss me again?

1089
01:27:07.633 --> 01:27:09.593
I can't.

1090
01:27:09.677 --> 01:27:12.178
I'm sorry.

1091
01:27:12.263 --> 01:27:14.472
This just feels weird.

1092
01:27:55.014 --> 01:27:57.433
Help!

1093
01:28:24.086 --> 01:28:25.920
Needy.

1094
01:28:28.423 --> 01:28:30.341
St. Jude, patron saint
of hopeless causes,

1095
01:28:30.425 --> 01:28:33.260
please give me the power
to crush this bitch.

1096
01:28:59.706 --> 01:29:00.998
Needy.

1097
01:29:26.482 --> 01:29:28.775
She can fly?

1098
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.945
She's just hovering.
It's not that impressive.

1099
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:35.198
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1100
01:29:35.283 --> 01:29:37.242
You are such a player-hater.

1101
01:29:37.326 --> 01:29:39.745
You're a jerk.

1102
01:29:39.829 --> 01:29:42.706
Wow. Nice insult, Hannah Montana.

1103
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:44.584
You got any more harsh digs?

1104
01:29:44.668 --> 01:29:47.962
You know what?
You were never a good friend.

1105
01:29:48.047 --> 01:29:51.632
Even when we were little,
you used to steal my toys...

1106
01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:53.468
and pour lemonade on my bed.

1107
01:29:53.552 --> 01:29:55.303
And now I'm eating
your boyfriend.

1108
01:29:55.387 --> 01:29:58.139
See? At least I'm consistent.

1109
01:29:58.223 --> 01:30:01.350
Why do you need him? Huh?

1110
01:30:01.435 --> 01:30:03.978
You could have anybody
that you want, Jennifer.

1111
01:30:04.063 --> 01:30:07.273
So... why Chip?

1112
01:30:07.357 --> 01:30:09.984
Is itjust to tick me off?

1113
01:30:10.069 --> 01:30:12.445
Or is it because
you're just really insecure?

1114
01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:16.032
I'm— I am not insecure, Needy.

1115
01:30:16.116 --> 01:30:18.951
God, that's a joke.
How could I ever be insecure?

1116
01:30:19.036 --> 01:30:21.746
I was the Snowflake Queen.

1117
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:25.625
Yeah. Two years ago,
when you were socially relevant.

1118
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:27.335
I am still socially relevant.

1119
01:30:27.419 --> 01:30:30.922
And when you didn't
need laxatives to stay skinny.

1120
01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.678
I am going...

1121
01:30:36.763 --> 01:30:38.764
to eat your soul...

1122
01:30:38.848 --> 01:30:42.893
and shit it out, Lesnicki!

1123
01:30:42.977 --> 01:30:46.105
- Thought you only murdered boys.
- I go both ways.

1124
01:31:01.955 --> 01:31:05.332
Ow.

1125
01:31:16.469 --> 01:31:18.470
You got a tampon?

1126
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:23.350
Thought I'd ask.

1127
01:31:23.434 --> 01:31:26.311
You seem like
you might be plugging.

1128
01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:49.169
Oh, Chip.

1129
01:31:50.212 --> 01:31:53.006
Needy.

1130
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:56.426
I should have believed you.

1131
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:58.428
I'm sorry.

1132
01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:02.432
No. No, no. Listen to me.
I'm gonna get some help. Okay?

1133
01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:05.310
Okay? Yeah. Okay.

1134
01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.568
It's not working.

1135
01:32:13.652 --> 01:32:15.737
Fuck!

1136
01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:17.697
- Come on!
- Hey, hey.

1137
01:32:20.993 --> 01:32:23.204
I'm going somewhere.

1138
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:26.665
No, no, no. You're not
going anywhere. Yes, I am.

1139
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:30.961
I think I already died before you got here,
but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1140
01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:36.759
I love you.

1141
01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:41.931
I love you too.

1142
01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.230
And you look totally hot
in that dress.

1143
01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:53.108
Oh, you're clearly delirious.

1144
01:32:53.193 --> 01:32:56.070
No, I'm not.

1145
01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:04.203
Oh, Ch— No!

1146
01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:06.288
No!

1147
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.291
No!

1148
01:33:11.378 --> 01:33:18.468
No!

1149
01:34:21.658 --> 01:34:23.826
Abduction and adduction, right?

1150
01:34:23.952 --> 01:34:25.870
Inner and outer. But you
know what's really important?

1151
01:34:25.954 --> 01:34:27.872
"Hurdle" or "Sprint. "
That's huge.

1152
01:34:27.956 --> 01:34:32.918
Now, say I wanna do just my hip
flexors orjust my buttocks even more.

1153
01:34:33.003 --> 01:34:37.298
I do what's called digging. I use
this for a lot of swimwear models.

1154
01:34:37.382 --> 01:34:40.301
Very, very, very important.
How about Butt Squeeze?

1155
01:34:40.385 --> 01:34:45.222
Yeah, I see you wanted to touch. Not
this show! Not touching this show!

1156
01:34:45.307 --> 01:34:47.641
Okay. And of course-

1157
01:34:47.726 --> 01:34:49.727
Off]

1158
01:35:26.724 --> 01:35:28.683
Best friends forever,
huh?

1159
01:35:29.977 --> 01:35:33.814
You killed my fucking boyfriend,
you goddamn monster!

1160
01:35:33.898 --> 01:35:35.690
You dumb bitch!

1161
01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:42.489
Mmm!

1162
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:47.536
You know what this is for? Huh?

1163
01:35:48.287 --> 01:35:50.122
It's for cutting boxes.

1164
01:35:52.792 --> 01:35:55.378
Do you buy all your murder
weapons at Home Depot?

1165
01:35:55.462 --> 01:35:57.880
God, you're butch.

1166
01:35:59.299 --> 01:36:01.300
Cross outJennifer.

1167
01:37:16.878 --> 01:37:18.879
My tit.

1168
01:37:21.257 --> 01:37:24.176
No. Your heart.

1169
01:37:45.574 --> 01:37:48.326
Jennifer, what is it, baby?

1170
01:37:50.204 --> 01:37:52.121
Needy?

1171
01:37:52.206 --> 01:37:55.124
Oh, my God.

1172
01:37:56.502 --> 01:37:58.378
Oh, my God!

1173
01:38:01.924 --> 01:38:05.009
Oh, God!

1174
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:25.113
I don't know
who Needy Lesnicki is anymore.

1175
01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:37.001
I'm a different person now.

1176
01:38:37.085 --> 01:38:40.004
A person who uses curse words
and kicks orderlies...

1177
01:38:40.088 --> 01:38:42.131
and sees things that aren't there.

1178
01:38:42.215 --> 01:38:44.800
A very bad, very damaged person.

1179
01:38:45.885 --> 01:38:48.387
But sometimes change can be good.

1180
01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:50.931
For instance,
most occult scholars don't know this,

1181
01:38:51.016 --> 01:38:54.643
but ifyou're bitten by a demon
and you live,

1182
01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:57.646
you just might absorb
some of the demon's abilities.

1183
01:38:57.731 --> 01:39:01.233
You just might get lucky
for once in your miserable life.

1184
01:40:23.151 --> 01:40:25.069
Where are you looking to go,
young lady?

1185
01:40:25.153 --> 01:40:26.862
East, towards Madison.

1186
01:40:28.532 --> 01:40:30.366
Hop in my chariot.

1187
01:40:37.666 --> 01:40:40.167
So, why are you headed east?

1188
01:40:40.252 --> 01:40:42.628
I'm following this rock band.

1189
01:40:44.714 --> 01:40:46.799
Must be one hell of a group.

1190
01:40:46.883 --> 01:40:49.218
Tonight's gonna be their last show.
