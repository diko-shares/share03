00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.711
Every day I get letters.

2
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:52.384
I think I get more letters than Santa
Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined.

3
00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:58.265
I'm kinda the shit.

Grassy-ass, Raymundo.

6
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.282
Sometimes, the letters are from people
who say they're praying for me.

7
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:19.495
They tell me everything will be okay
if I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart.

8
00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:24.583
I say the words,
but nothing ever happens.

9
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.544
Nobody comes back.

10
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.214
Nobody gets off the cross.

11
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.346
Welcome to the Mental Olympics.

12
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.432
They're big on recreation here.

13
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.018
Supposedly, it helps us
vent our aggressions.

14
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.022
Oh, yeah!

15
00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.777
Personally, I think they're
trying to wear us out,

16
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:54.530
keep us sluggish
so there won't be an uprising.

17
00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.784
Well, those J.V. tactics
won't work against me.

18
00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.786

Just one Toast 'Em, huh?

22
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.092
I like Toast 'Ems.
Well, that's good.

23
00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:18.262
But I'm not sure a Toast 'Em can provide
sufficient energy during your day.

24
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.514

"Wear something cute" meant something

- No offense.

like, a drummer who's also the lead singer.

112
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.443
- Like Phil Collins.
- Who's Phil Collins?

He's seminal, but whatever.

Yeah, 'cause they're wearing eyeliner.
They look like a bunch off gays.

170
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:37.404
Well, you would think that, Roman,
because you're a small-time Gamer.

171
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.156
I wish we had more guys
like that in Devil's Kettle.

172
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.742
All stylish and shit.

173
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.665
I think they need two groupies.

174
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:52.252
No! No. Come on.
Don't be so J.V., Needy.

175
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.130
They’re just boys, morsels.
We have all the power.

176
00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.173
Don't you know that?
These things?

177
00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.552
These are like
smart bombs. Okay?

178
00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:04.305
You point them in the right
direction, and shit gets real.

179
00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.436
Hi.
Hi.

180
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.982
Uh we just wanted to
meet you or something.

181
00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:17.193
I'm Jennifer Check,
and this is my friend.

182
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.404
Hi. I'm Nikolai.

183
00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:22.198
This is, uh 
These guys are my band.

184
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:26.453
Low Shoulder. Yeah, we've
heard  I've heard about you.

185
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:30.331
You play your instruments
really super good.

186
00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.084
Thank you.
We are professionals.

187
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.504
Hey. Sorry.
Could I ask you a question?

188
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:40.091
Um, why would you wanna play
all the way out here in Devil's Kettle?

189
00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:42.260
You live in the city, right?
Yeah.

190
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:45.597
But, you know, I think it's really important
sometimes to try and connect with our fans...

191
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:47.932
in the shitty areas too.

192
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:51.186
That's amazing.

193
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.355
Can I, um  Can I buy you a drink?

194
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.191
Sure. What are we having?

195
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.486
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter.

196
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.989
It's red, white and blue, but you have to
drink it really fast or it turns brownish.

197
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.741
All right. Well, we'll
drink it fast. okay.

198
00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.869
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

199
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:10.330
Hey, how- how are you
gonna get alcohol?

200
00:13:10.414 --> 00:13:13.458
Um, I'll just play Hello Titty
with the bartender.

201
00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.006
Aw, shit.

202
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.845
Dirk, what about her?

203
00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:30.058
- Who, Jan Brady?
- No, man. Fuck you.

204
00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:33.019
I'm talking about the one who went to get
me a drink. The State Fair Butter Princess.

205
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.146
That's the one. I don't
know. Are you sure she's-

206
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.940
Listen, I grew up
in a town like this, okay?

207
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:40.777
There's always that girl. They love to
show it off, but they do not give it up.

208
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:43.196
You told us
you were from Brooklyn.

209
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.658
My point is, this girl is
definitely a virgin, okay?

210
00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:49.327
- I know girls like that. I've dated chicks 
- I don't know.

211
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:52.080
Well, we didn't drive
all the way out here for nothing, so 

212
00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:54.791
Fine. Okay? You know,
I'm not just your bassist.

213
00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:58.127
I'm a person with feelings
who happens to play the bass-

214
00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.129
- Excuse me.
- I'd like a little respect around here.

215
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:04.008
Look, I didn't know
you had feelings. Hey.

216
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:07.804
Hey. That's my best friend
that you're talking about.

217
00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:10.181
And you're right.
She is a virgin.

218
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.685
And that beats sleeping
with creeps like you.

219
00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.366
Tower One
isn't full enough.

220
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.743
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

221
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.788
You know what? I think
the lead singer wants me.

222
00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:36.749
Only because he thinks that you're
a virgin. I heard them talking.

223
00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:41.337
What? I'm not even a backdoor
virgin anymore, thanks to Roman.

224
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.756
And by the way, that hurts.

225
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.800
I couldn't even go
to Flags the next day.

226
00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.469
I had to stay home and sit
on a bag of frozen peas.

227
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.431
Oh, my God.

228
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.768
Good evening, Devil's Lake.
Devil's Kettle!

229
00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:57.854

No!

260
00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:27.170
Run!

261
00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.092
We can't get
through there!

262
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:45.271
I know where to go!

263
00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:11.130
Hey. Hey. Jen?

264
00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:18.262
Hey.

265
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.682
Jennifer? oh, thank God
you guys are all right.

266
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.477
I've been looking
everywhere for you two.

267
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:27.730
Listen, it's really
dangerous out here.

268
00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:31.692
You wanna head someplace
safer, like my van? What?

269
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:36.239
I'm in survival mode right now,
and I want us to get to a familiar place.

270
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.699
And right now, I feel
like that's my van. okay.

271
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.785
Okay, this one's
in shock. Great.

272
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.246
Are you in shock?
Have some of that.

273
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.623
No.

274
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:48.918
Jennifer?

275
00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.421
Hey.

276
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.843
Let's go, Jennifer!
Let's go to the van.

277
00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:59.720
I wanna go to your really cool
van. Needy, let's go see his van.

278
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.722
Why? Why should we?

279
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.891
We have the Sebring.
Let’s just get out of here!

280
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.686
Let's go to L.o. o. and get some
Northwoods Nachos with extra badger sauce.

281
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.439
- Please? I'm starving.
- Needy, stop it! Just shut up.

282
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.834
I watched her get into that van,

283
00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.503
and I knew something awful
was going to happen.

284
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.589
He was skinny
and twisted and evil,

285
00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:37.842
like this petrified tree
I saw when I was a kid.

286
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:10.082
Oh.

287
00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.392
- Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Oh, thank God you're there.

288
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.770
What's wrong?
Jennifer's gone.

289
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.230
She ran off with that rock band,
and Melody Lane burned down.

290
00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:38.736
You're okay, right?
Uh, yeah.

291
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.155
But there was this huge stampede,

292
00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:43.449
and all the people that fainted
got run over,

293
00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:46.452
and you could hear
their bones breaking.

294
00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:48.871
And the people 

295
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.249
like, the people on fire
just smelled like 

296
00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:55.378
This is crazy. Jennifer's
still with those creeps.

297
00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.798
They took her in their spooky van
with the windows all blacked out.

298
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:02.510
- Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist?

299
00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.720
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

300
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.931
Who cares about Jennifer
and those douche bags...

301
00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:09.016
with their douche bag haircuts
and their man-sacra?

302
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.185
People just burned to death.

303
00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:13.938
Oh, cheese and fries.
There's somebody here!

304
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:16.190
I'm all alone.
I'm freaked out.

305
00:21:16.274 --> 00:21:18.943
- Where is your mom?
- Swing shift.

306
00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:24.323
Stay on the phone
with me, okay?

307
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.246
Needy, do you want me
to come over or something?

308
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.665
I don't know. Maybe.

309
00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.886
Needy?

310
00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.478
Okay, so now
there's no one here.

311
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.232
That's so strange.

312
00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.317
Maybe I'm going crazy.

313
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:04.739
It's probably nothing.

314
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.575
Look, I'll call you later.
Okay.

315
00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:27.321
Hi.

316
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.124
Jen.

317
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.209
What happened?

318
00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:51.887
Jen?

319
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.997
Um 

320
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:23.252
My mom got that at Boston Market,
and I'm  I'm not supposed to-

321
00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:58.913
Jennifer. Jennifer?

322
00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:02.208
Jennifer.

323
00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:28.609
Are you scared?

324
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:47.670
Jennifer!

325
00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:05.187
Another body under here!

326
00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:08.607
♪ 

327
00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:15.322
I heard Needy and Jennifer
were there,

328
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:18.325
and they had to fight their
way out with a machete.

329
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.536
Look, she's not
even moving.

330
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.205
It's called post-traumatic
stress disorder.

331
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.125
My dad was in operation
Enduring Freedom,

332
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:29.378
and he totally, like, stopped talking
for, like, months.

333
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:37.928
I'll be Perfect Prom Betty,
and you be her.

334
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.722
Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?

335
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:42.474
Ow!
What's wrong, Jennifer?

336
00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:54.236
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me a shot.

Remember when we were in Girl Scout camp,
and you thought that there was an earthquake,

343
00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:18.177

with a ghetto blaster?

National news.

Anybody that we know?
We know everyone.

347
00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:33.734

scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum.

352
00:27:58.093 --> 00:27:59.718
Shoot.

freakish Needy behaviors...

363
00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:38.132
including Ahmet from India,

364
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.801

365
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.345

put aside your teenage concerns...

369
00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:56.942

or who's a ho.

There's no anything today.

dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops.

It's about Jennifer.
What?

379
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.753
You know how last night we were talking,
and someone came to my house? It was Jennifer.

380
00:29:57.837 --> 00:30:00.797
She looked like she had been
beaten up or shot or something.

381
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:05.928
And then she barfed up
this, like, disgusting, prickly stuff...

382
00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:09.556
that looked like road kill and,
like, sewing needles mixed together.

383
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.266
Yuck.

384
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:15.521
Well, she probably just inhaled a
whole bunch of smoke or something.

385
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:17.523
No, Chip. No, it was like 

386
00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:19.858
It was, like, evil.

Needy, I think you might wanna
talk to the school shrink.

388

I'm not saying that
to be a dill hole.

I didn't say you were crazy.

It’s just, everybody's a little messed
up about this, and it's okay to feel 

392
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.624

Yeah. Fucked up.

You know, Chip is looking
really cute to me lately.

514
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.683
So, tell me, is he, uh, like, packing
some serious pubic inches?

515
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:57.685
What's the story down there?

516
00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.021
I gotta go.

Why are the cops
at your house?

They're not. They're
at Jonas Kozelle's house.

00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:15.662
Why? He try to sell fake peyote to the eighth
graders again? No, Needy. He was murdered.

00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:17.288
What?
Yeah.

521
00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:19.791
Someone ripped Jonas limb from
limb in the woods behind school.

522
00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:21.751
They ate parts of him.

523
00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:25.213
No one's even supposed to know yet, but my dad
just went over there and talked to the cops.

524
00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:27.215
His mom is, like, catatonic.

She’s just staring out the front window
like a zombie mannequin robot statue.

This can't
be a coincidence.

talking about, Needy?

A fiery death trap
last night,

529
00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.523
and now a cannibal psycho takes
down the biggest guy in school?

gotta be over, right?

We were fucking idiots.

561
00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:35.885
Before the period ends,
I'd like to make an announcement.

562
00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:40.014
As you all know, today is
the one month anniversary...

563
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:43.351
of the tragedy
at Melody Lane...

564
00:42:43.435 --> 00:42:46.062
and the murder of Jonas Kozelle.

565
00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:47.897
Boring.
Jesus!

566
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:50.024
What a bitch.

567
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:52.318
As I was saying,
Jennifer and Needy,

568
00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:55.405
I finally have some good news
to share with all of you.

569
00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:58.449
The members of the rock and roll
group Low Shoulder...

570
00:42:58.534 --> 00:43:02.120
have decided to extend a
helping hand to our community.

571
00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:06.290
As you all know, their song,
"Through The Trees,"

572
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:08.876
has become our unofficial anthem...

573
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:11.796
of unity and healing.

574
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.382
And they have decided
to release it as a benefit single.

575
00:43:14.466 --> 00:43:17.385
Three percent of the profits
will go to local families...

576
00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:19.387
who have been affected by loss.

577
00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:21.431
What about the other 97%?

578
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:25.435
I mean, that’s just crass, right?

579
00:43:27.229 --> 00:43:31.399
"Crass. " It means greedy,
exploitative, scummy.

580
00:43:31.483 --> 00:43:33.484
Low Shoulder
are American heroes.

581
00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:36.612
No, they're not!
I was there, Chastity.

582
00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:38.906
They didn't help anybody
escape the fire.

583
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:41.576
I don't even know how
that rumor got started.

584
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.828
Rumor? Rumor?

585
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:47.123
It's true.
It's on the Wikipedia.

586
00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:51.544
We wouldn't even know who they were
if they hadn't been playing that night.

587
00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:54.297
- They used us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki.

588
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:56.716
- Girls 
- We need them now more than ever.

589
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.011
That's enough.

590
00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:04.599
I'm already sick of that song.

591
00:44:04.683 --> 00:44:06.976
Yeah, it's really poorly produced.

592
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:09.062
Could the bass
be any lower in the mix?

593
00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:12.231
No offense, but you
look really tired.

594
00:44:12.357 --> 00:44:16.194
Is everything okay?
No. I feel like boo-boo.

595
00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:21.074
My skin is breaking out,
and my hair is dull and lifeless.

596
00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:24.994
God. It's like I'm one
of the normal girls.

597
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.414
Are you P.M.S.
- ing or something'? P.M.S. isn't real, Needy.

598
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:31.709
It was invented by the boy-run
media to make us seem crazy.

599
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.713
Don't look at me like that!

600
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:39.550
It’s just wearing off
or something.

601
00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:41.219
What's wearing off?

602
00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:46.599
Hello, Needy.
Hi.

603
00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:49.560
Jennifer.
Hi, Colin.

604
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:52.980
Can I borrow your English homework
again? I forgot to read Hamlet.

605
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:56.234

606
00:44:56.318 --> 00:44:58.736
No  I don't ” I don't ”
I don't think so.

607
00:44:58.821 --> 00:45:01.614
Um, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

608
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.158
You wanna know if I'll
go out with you? No!

609
00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:07.328
Yeah. What? l 

610
00:45:07.412 --> 00:45:10.915
- I don't g  How'd you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

611
00:45:13.252 --> 00:45:16.003
okay. Um 

612
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:19.465
Well, we've been having
a lot of fun in class, you and I,

613
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:23.928
and I thought that maybe you'd
like to go see a movie or something.

614
00:45:24.012 --> 00:45:27.849
There's a, uh, midnight showing of
Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend.

615
00:45:27.933 --> 00:45:30.101
I don't like boxing movies.

616
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.941
Yeah, but it's no 
It's not a... fucking boxing movie.

617
00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:39.318
Um, fuck it.
Okay. Forget it.

618
00:45:42.447 --> 00:45:45.616
- That was random.
- I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

619
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.829
Colin's really nice.

620
00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:52.456
He's into maggot rock.
He wears nail polish.

621
00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:56.294
My dick is bigger than his.
I think he's really cool.

626
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.108

her blowhole or something.

talk to somebody about these...

847
01:09:44.054 --> 01:09:47.724
disturbing thoughts
that you're having.

848
01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:49.767
We're all really concerned.

849
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:52.437
Especially Chip.

850
01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:56.441
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

851
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:59.485
Leave. Come on, Needy.
Let me stay the night.

852
01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:03.197
We can play boyfriend-girlfriend
like we used to.

853
01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:21.340
What are you doing?
Um, you said to leave.

854
01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.176
See you at school.

855
01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:53.581
We are gathered here
to celebrate the life of Colin Gray,

856
01:10:53.665 --> 01:10:56.584
who was plucked
from the prime of his youth 

857
01:10:56.668 --> 01:10:58.795
Colin!

858
01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:01.589
Take me with you!

859
01:11:01.673 --> 01:11:05.593
I belong down there...
in the darkness!

860
01:11:05.677 --> 01:11:09.472
No, Kevin. Those are just
his earthly remains.

861
01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:13.101
He's among the dark
angels of the realm now.

862
01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.686
Fly, Colin.
Fly into the firmament.

863
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.031
Colin wouldn't like this.

864
01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.033
You think so?

865
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.743
Yeah, you're right.

866
01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:36.040
I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have
liked being eaten by a fucking cannibal...

867
01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.000
and buried
before his 18th birthday.

868
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:42.839
Wow. You must have
known him so well. Jill.

869
01:11:42.923 --> 01:11:46.926
By the time they found Colin
in that godforsaken house,

870
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.096
he looked like lasagna with teeth.

871
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.808
I'd know.
I had to identify the remains.

872
01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.351
My boy...

873
01:11:55.435 --> 01:11:58.563
is not in the realm of the undead.

874
01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:02.400
He is not flying around
in the firmament...

875
01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.819
on magical wings of flame.

876
01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:08.990
He's in an overpriced rosewood box...

877
01:12:09.074 --> 01:12:12.410
that's headed six feet downtown.

878
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.416
So...

879
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.751
you can take your pain...

880
01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:25.006
and you can shove it
up your asses, kids.

881
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.759
I got the monopoly on pain.

882
01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:46.694
They did a big memorial assembly
f or Colin at school.

883
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.281
And we had to watch another presentation
about curfews and the buddy system...

884
01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:53.075
and how to deal with grief.

885
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.162
But nobody seemed
to care anymore.

886
01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:58.748
Sorrow was last week's emotion.

887
01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.086
Sure, we all hoped
this would be the last funeral,

888
01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.464
but I knew better.

889
01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:09.091
So I did some research.

890
01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:10.843
Paranormal research.

891
01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.943
"offering a virgin to Satan. "

892
01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.029
"If the sacrifice is impure-

893
01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:33.241
Human and demonic relations" 

894
01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.494
"Destroying a demon.

895
01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:39.163
"Demons are weakest when hungry,

896
01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.959
but a blade to the heart
is the surest way to kill the beast. "

897
01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:52.218
Jennifer and I hadn't spoken
since our encounter in my room.

898
01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:56.806
Actually, I hadn't really
spoken to anyone.

899
01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:15.449
Hey.

900
01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.452
Just bought our formal tickets.

901
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.454
Did you make reservations
at the Cheesecake Factory?

902
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.376
Chip, I can't go
to the dance with you.

903
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.919
What? Why?

904
01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:30.423
Look, just trust me.
You shouldn't go at all.

905
01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:32.883
What are you talking about?
Not here.

906
01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:35.886
What's going on?
You're breaking up with me?

907
01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.055
Please, Chip! I just need
to show you something.

908
01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:39.765
Is this about Jennifer?
Yes!

909
01:14:39.891 --> 01:14:43.436
But I promise you this is the last
thing  Needy, I care about you. A lot.

910
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.732
As a person, not just some girl I made
love to for f our minutes the other night.

911
01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:51.402
And I'm scared of what's happening to
you. You're acting really fucked up.

912
01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:54.196
Please just let me show you.

913
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.158
Okay.

914
01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:59.452
Jennifer's evil.

915
01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:01.495
I know.

916
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.123
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

917
01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:05.666
Not high-school evil.

918
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:09.795
I've been through the occult
section at the library five times.

919
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.131
Our library
has an occult section?

920
01:15:12.215 --> 01:15:14.800
Yeah, it's um  it's really small.

921
01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:17.720
Uh, you have to read this.

922
01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.766
"Demoni" 
"Demonic transference. "

923
01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:25.269
It's something that happens when you
try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan...

924
01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.687
without using an actual virgin.

925
01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.774
The guys in the band tried to
sacrifice her in the woods.

926
01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:32.818
But what they didn't know is that she
hasn't been a virgin since junior high.

927
01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:34.737
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

928
01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.823
"If the human sacrifice is impure,
the result may still be attained,

929
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.284
"but the demon will forever reside
in the soul of the victim.

930
01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.162
She must forever feed on flesh
to sustain the demon. "

931
01:15:43.246 --> 01:15:45.498
- Okay.
- She's eating boys!

932
01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:48.876
They, like, make her
really pretty and glowy...

933
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.753
and her hair looks amazing.

934
01:15:50.837 --> 01:15:53.964
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

935
01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.467
I mean, like, ugly f or her.

936
01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.386
Don't you get it?

937
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:59.970
The dance.

938
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:03.099
It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

939
01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:08.354
Needy, I think you need help.

940
01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:10.940
oh, my God. You don't believe me.

941
01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:14.318
It's not that I don't believe you.
I just don't believe this.

942
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.487
God! This is a nightmare!

943
01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:20.866
Well, what about the dance?

944
01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.285
Who cares about
the goddamn dance, Chip?

945
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.830
I do. I ordered your corsage.

946
01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:29.125
It's an orchid. It was, like, $12.

947
01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:35.798
I'll be at the dance.
I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer.

948
01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:38.634
Promise me you're not gonna go.

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:34.346
What? What is it?

1017
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:38.434
You know how Needy has been
really upset since Colin Gray died?

1018
01:21:38.518 --> 01:21:40.185
Mm-hmm.

1019
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:44.731
Well, it's not just because he was,
like, brutally murdered and stuff.

1020
01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:47.401
I don't wanna say this!
Say it.

1021
01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:50.362
I hope everybody
has had an opportunity...

1022
01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:53.991
to consume some of the pecan
sandies and Cran-Grape...

1023
01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:56.952
that were so generously donated
by the parents club.

1024
01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.079
Yeah!

1025
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.916
Needy and Colin
were intimate.

1026
01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:06.044
And by that...

1027
01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:09.506
I mean they were fucking
on a semi-regular basis.

1028
01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.758
No.

1029
01:22:11.843 --> 01:22:15.554
She and Colin were doing things
that you have never even heard of.

1030
01:22:15.638 --> 01:22:17.639
Okay?
Total varsity moves.

1031
01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:26.190
But the real treat
is yet to come.

1032
01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.567
We have some special guests
this evening.

1033
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:32.488
I just can't believe that she would
mess with your head like this.

1034
01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:36.992
I care about you
so much, Chip.

1035
01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.582
More than I've ever
had the guts to admit.

1036
01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.377
These fine young gentlemen...

1037
01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:49.880
have been generous enough
to take time out...

1038
01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:53.383
from their sold-out national tour...

1039
01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:57.471
to play our dance
for free.

1040
01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:03.310
Needy didn't deserve
a boy like you.

1041
01:23:03.394 --> 01:23:06.980
Boys and girls,
please welcome...

1042
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:10.025

Hi, Camille. Hey!
Is Chipper home?

1072
01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:32.751
- Needy, is something wrong?
- Where's Chip?

1073
01:25:32.835 --> 01:25:36.171
- He left for the dance at least 20 minutes ago.
- He walked?

1074
01:25:36.255 --> 01:25:39.049
It's only five blocks.
My God, your hair is-

1075
01:25:39.133 --> 01:25:42.844
- Which way did he go?
- He usually cuts across the park.

1076
01:25:42.929 --> 01:25:46.181
Camille, sit like a lady!
No one wants to see your kiki!

1077
01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:48.100
Why don't you try-

1078
01:25:48.184 --> 01:25:50.143
Anita?

1079
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.457
Mmm.

1080
01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:19.840
What are you doing?

1081
01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:21.758
Swimming.

1082
01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.552
Ha-ha.

1083
01:26:23.636 --> 01:26:25.429
Come on, Chip.

1084
01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:28.515
Show me your breast stroke.

1085
01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:45.073
I feel so empty.

1086
01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.913
Yeah, me too.

1087
01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:56.877
Why don't you just come here
and kiss me again?

1088
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.139
I can't.

1089
01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:11.725
I'm sorry.

1090
01:27:11.809 --> 01:27:14.019
This just f eels weird.

1091
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.978
Help!

1092
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.465
Needy.

1093
01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.886
St. Jude, patron saint
of hopeless causes,

1094
01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.806
please give me the power
to crush this bitch.

1095
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.542
Needy.

1096
01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.320
She can fly?

1097
01:29:28.404 --> 01:29:31.489
She’s just hovering.
It's not that impressive.

1098
01:29:31.574 --> 01:29:34.743
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1099
01:29:34.827 --> 01:29:36.786
You are such a player-hater.

1100
01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:39.289
You're a jerk.

1101
01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:42.250
Wow. Nice insult, Hannah Montana.

1102
01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:44.127
You got any more harsh digs?

1103
01:29:44.211 --> 01:29:47.505
You know what?
You were never a good friend.

1104
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:51.176
Even when we were little,
you used to steal my toys...

1105
01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.011
and pour lemonade on my bed.

1106
01:29:53.095 --> 01:29:54.846
And now I'm eating
your boyfriend.

1107
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:57.682
See? At least I'm consistent.

1108
01:29:57.767 --> 01:30:00.894
Why do you need him? Huh?

1109
01:30:00.978 --> 01:30:03.521
You could have anybody
that you want, Jennifer.

1110
01:30:03.606 --> 01:30:06.816
So... why Chip?

1111
01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:09.527
Is it just to tick me off?

1112
01:30:09.612 --> 01:30:11.988
Or is it because
you’re just really insecure?

1113
01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:15.575
I'm  I am not insecure, Needy.

1114
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.495
God, that's a joke.
How could I ever be insecure?

1115
01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:21.289
I was the Snowflake Queen.

1116
01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:25.168
Yeah. Two years ago,
when you were socially relevant.

1117
01:30:25.252 --> 01:30:26.878
I am still socially relevant.

1118
01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:30.465
And when you didn't
need laxatives to stay skinny.

1119
01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:36.221
I am going...

1120
01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:38.306
to eat your soul...

1121
01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:42.435
and shit it out, Lesnicki!

1122
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.647
- Thought you only murdered boys.
- I go both ways.

1123
01:31:01.497 --> 01:31:04.874
Ow.

1124
01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:18.013
You got a tampon?

1125
01:31:19.932 --> 01:31:22.892
Thought I'd ask.

1126
01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.854
You seem like
you might be plugging.

1127
01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:48.710
Oh, Chip.

1128
01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:52.547
Needy.

1129
01:31:52.631 --> 01:31:55.967
I should have believed you.

1130
01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:57.969
I'm sorry.

1131
01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:01.973
No. No, no. Listen to me.
I'm gonna get some help. Okay?

1132
01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.851
Okay? Yeah. okay.

1133
01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:13.109
It's not working.

1134
01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.278
Fuck!

1135
01:32:15.362 --> 01:32:17.238
- Come on!
- Hey, hey.

1136
01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:22.744
I'm going somewhere.

1137
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:26.206
No, no, no. You're not
going anywhere. Yes, I am.

1138
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:30.502
I think I already died before you got here,
but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1139
01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:36.299
I love you.

1140
01:32:39.595 --> 01:32:41.471
I love you too.

1141
01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:48.770
And you look totally hot
in that dress.

1142
01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:52.649
Oh, you're clearly delirious.

1143
01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:55.610
No, I'm not.

1144
01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:03.743
Oh, Ch  No!

1145
01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:05.829
No!

1146
01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:08.832
No!

1147
01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:18.007
No!

1148
01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:23.364
Abduction and adduction, right?

1149
01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:25.408
Inner and outer. But you
know what's really important?

1150
01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:27.410
"Hurdle" or "Sprint. "
That's huge.

1151
01:34:27.494 --> 01:34:32.457
Now, say I wanna do just my hip
flexors or just my buttocks even more.

1152
01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:36.836
I do what's called digging. I use
this for a lot of swimwear models.

1153
01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:39.839
Very, very, very important.
How about Butt Squeeze?

1154
01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:44.761
Yeah, I see you wanted to touch. Not
this show! Not touching this show!

1155
01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:47.180
okay. And of course-

1156
01:34:47.264 --> 01:34:49.265
Off]

1157
01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:28.221
Best friends forever,
huh?

1158
01:35:29.515 --> 01:35:33.351
You killed my fucking boyfriend,
you goddamn monster!

1159
01:35:33.435 --> 01:35:35.228
You dumb bitch!

1160
01:35:39.108 --> 01:35:42.026
Mmm!

1161
01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:47.073
You know what this is for? Huh?

1162
01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:49.659
It's for cutting boxes.

1163
01:35:52.329 --> 01:35:54.914
Do you buy all your murder
weapons at Home Depot?

1164
01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:57.417
God, you're butch.

1165
01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.837
Cross out Jennifer.

1166
01:37:16.413 --> 01:37:18.414
My tit.

1167
01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:23.711
No. Your heart.

1168
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:47.860
Jennifer, what is it, baby?

1169
01:37:49.738 --> 01:37:51.656
Needy?

1170
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.659
oh, my God.

1171
01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.912
oh, my God!

1172
01:38:01.458 --> 01:38:04.544
Oh, God!

1173
01:38:21.645 --> 01:38:24.647
I don't know
who Needy Lesnicki is anymore.

1174
01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:36.534
I'm a different person now.

1175
01:38:36.618 --> 01:38:39.537
A person who uses curse words
and kicks orderlies...

1176
01:38:39.621 --> 01:38:41.664
and sees things that aren't there.

1177
01:38:41.748 --> 01:38:44.333
A very bad, very damaged person.

1178
01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:47.920
But sometimes change can be good.

1179
01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:50.465
For instance,
most occult scholars don't know this,

1180
01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:54.177
but if you're bitten by a demon
and you live,

1181
01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:57.180
you just might absorb
some of the demon's abilities.

1182
01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:00.766
You just might get lucky
for once in your miserable life.

1183
01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.600
Where are you looking to go,
young lady?

1184
01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.394
East, towards Madison.

1185
01:40:28.063 --> 01:40:29.897
Hop in my chariot.

1186
01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:39.699
So, why are you headed east?

1187
01:40:39.783 --> 01:40:42.159
I'm following this rock band.

1188
01:40:44.246 --> 01:40:46.330
