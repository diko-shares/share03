00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:04.833
Thank you.

2
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:38.325
<i>I wish they all could be California girls</i>

3
00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.912
- The Beach Boys are dope.
-I love Beach Boys.

4
00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.914
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.583
Hey, ladies, how you doing?

6
00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:46.959
Wait a minute.

7
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:55.718
Hey, where you going?
Let's get some sushi!

8
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.345
Hey! Hey, cutie!

9
00:02:58.512 --> 00:02:59.597
Ah.

10
00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.932
<i>I wish they all could--</i>

11
00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.767
Hey, hey, he)”

12
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.144
That was my CD.

13
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:07.938
Don't you ever touch
a Chinese man's CD.

14
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.565
See the way those girls drove off?

15
00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:10.858
They was laughing at us.

16
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.526
Those girls drove off because of you.

17
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.237
All I did was invite them
to have a drink.

18
00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:20.242
You invited them to get naked
and sacrifice a small goat.

19
00:03:20.618 --> 00:03:22.036
Which word was goat?

20
00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.039
You owe me a copy
of the Beach Boys' greatest hits.

21
00:03:25.206 --> 00:03:26.707
Don't be getting no attitude with me.

22
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:29.335
I been here three days.
We done nothing but work your cases.

23
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:31.503
Only reason I'm here in Hong Kong
is you said...

24
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.172
...you was gonna show me
a good time.

25
00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.966
I'm on vacation, man,
and I want some mu sh...

26
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:37.426
Mu shu? You hungry?

27
00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:39.136
No, Lee, not mu shu.

28
00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:41.972
Some mu shu.
I wanna see some women, man.

29
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.807
Stop playing dumb
and show me to the shu.

30
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.838
What was that?

31
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.967
Did you just take another
damn case on my vacation, man?

32
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.762
Of course not.
My superintendent invited us to a club.

33
00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:25.224
- Big party tonight.
-Don't be messing with me, Lee.

34
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.102
I will slap you so hard,
you'll end up in the Ming dynasty.

35
00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.896
I mean it, man.
I'll bitch-slap you back to Bangkok.

36
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.565
- Big party?
-Big one.

37
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.069
Okay, well, let's go party then.

38
00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:43.367
Hey, this is nice. Hey, cutie.

39
00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:45.953
They don't like tourists in here,
so try to blend in.

40
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.580
What, blend in?
I'm <i>2</i> feet taller than everybody in here.

41
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.128
Wait here.

42
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.005
- Where you going?
-Bathroom.

43
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.966
Well, hurry back, man,
because we're gonna party.

44
00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.676
Party!

45
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.306
Ooh

46
00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:08.434
<i>Love</i>

Come here a lot?

49
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.609
It's a nice place.

50
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:21.864
<i>Take us through the hours</i>

51
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.574
<i>I won't make you, baby</i>

52
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:27.161
What in the world
is going on up in here?

53
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.830
Am I the only one listening to this?

54
00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.249
The man destroying a classic!

55
00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.500
<i>To the force don't stop</i>

56
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.169
<i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>

57
00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:37.713
<i>Keep on to the force don't stop</i>

Boo!

60
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.051
<i>Till the force don't stop</i>

61
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.552
<i>Till the force don't stop</i>

62
00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.387
<i>Don't stop till you get enough</i>

63
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:46.638
<i>Keep on</i>

64
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.140
I can't take no more of this.

65
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:15.042
<i>Get closer</i>

66
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.378

<i>Ah, don't stop till you get enough</i>

<i>Keep on till the force starts up</i>

Come on! Come on!

79
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.958
Ow!

80
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.210
Come here, <i>girls</i>

81
00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:59.461
<i>Don't stop till you--</i>

82
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:00.712
Come on, girl!

83
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.214
<i>I can't believe it</i>

84
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.093
Come on, come OH, come on.

85
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.511
Don't stop, come on.

86
00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:09.680
You know you feel the force!

87
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:13.267
<i>Oh, whoa
Don't stop till you get enough</i>

88
00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.228
I feel the force!

89
00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:18.105
- Carter!
-Come on!

90
00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:19.815
- Come on!
-Carter!

91
00:07:19.982 --> 00:07:21.900

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.779
Come on!

94
00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.282
<i>I'll be right back</i>

95
00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.075
<i>I'll be right back</i>

96
00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:32.161
<i>I'll be right back</i>

97
00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.955
Lee, these people love me, man.
Come on out here.

98
00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.248
Get off the stage.

99
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:38.041
Are you crazy, man? I'm a star!

100
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.127
I'm a god to these people.
Come check this out.

101
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.463
This is a gangster bar.
We are here undercover.

102
00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.260
I knew you was lying.
I knew you was lying, man.

103
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:49.636
I'm sorry, Carter.

104
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.097
- You a liar!
-We are here to find Ricky Tan.

105
00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:53.765
We must tread softly.

106
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.935
Tread softly?
What in the world you talking about?

107
00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.062
Who taught you how to roust a bar?
Tread softly.

108
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:03.233
These men are Triads,
the most deadly gang in China.

109
00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:04.568
You think that scare me?

110
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:06.570
I'm from Los Angeles.
We invented gangs.

111
00:08:06.737 --> 00:08:09.239
- Give me that badge. I'll show you--
-No. You are civilian!

112
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.533
In Hong Kong, I'm Michael Jackson!
You are Toto!

113
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.203
You mean Tito!
Toto is what we ate last night for dinner.

114
00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.914
- Now give me that badge. Give it.
-No!

115
00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.462
Okay, listen up!

116
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:33.847
Right now!

117
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.233
What did I just say?

118
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.984
You just asked everybody...

119
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:50.656
...to pick up their samurai swords
and shave your butt.

120
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.283
- I said that?
- Yes.

121
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.578
Come out here
and translate this for me.

122
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.581
All right, listen up!

123
00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.459
All the Triads and the ugly women
on this side...

124
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:06.046
...and all the fine women
on this side right now!

125
00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:07.464
Translate it.

126
00:09:14.096 --> 00:09:16.390
Y'all gonna act
like y'all don't hear what I'm saying.

127
00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:18.433
All right, who in here know Ricky Tan?

128
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.685
Raise your hand.

129
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.145
Translate.

130
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.572
I see what's going on here.

131
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.282
Okay.

132
00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.742
I ain't got time
to be playing no games now.

133
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.993
- I’m taking--
Hu Li!

134
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.538
- Wait.
- Hey, Lee!

135
00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.804
Out of the Way! L.A.P.D.!

136
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.917
Lee! Hold up!

137
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.134
Aw, hell no. Uh-uh.

138
00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:38.597
Lee, I'm taking the stairs!

139
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:25.787
Carter!

140
00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.373
Over here!

141
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.084
- Lee!
- Help me!

142
00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.545
How you get down there?

143
00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.213
Hurry UP!

144
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.923
Hold on!

145
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.425
Don't let go, man.

146
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.720
- Here.
-Watch out! Behind you!

147
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:43.305
- Huh?
-Behind you!

148
00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:44.556
What?

149
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.397
Who the hell was that?

150
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.860
Lord Jesus, I don't wanna die!

151
00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.154
Lee, help me, man!

152
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:02.783
Don't worry.
Chinese bamboo is very strong.

153
00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:07.579
- You sure, man?
-I’m sure.

154
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.375
Lee!

155
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:24.846
Let go! Let go!

156
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:28.141
I can't believe I flew 10,000 miles
for this shit!

157
00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:43.073
I can't believe you lied to me, man.

158
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.492
- I’m sorry.
-You're sorry?

159
00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.286
I got somebody's old chopsticks
stuck up my ass...

160
00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:50.121
...all you gotta say to me is you sorry?

161
00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:53.416
- There was an explosion.
-I don't give a damn!

162
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.795
At the American embassy.
Two Americans were killed.

163
00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.757
So you think this guy Ricky Tan
blew up the embassy?

164
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:02.342
I don't know.

165
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.177
Why the hell
are you looking for him then?

166
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.138
- We're gonna find out.
-No, you gonna find out, man.

167
00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.475
There's two billion Chinese people here.
Let one of them be your partner.

168
00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.108
- Where the hell we at now?
-Massage parlor.

169
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:19.901
Heaven on Earth.

170
00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.945
Now, this is more like it.

171
00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:23.905
I'm about to go in here
and get a massage...

172
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.366
...and a hot tea bath right now.

173
00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.702
Just follow my lead. Act like a tourist.

174
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.079
I am a tourist, fool.

175
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:37.043
Hey! Slow down, Chen!
Hell is wrong with you?

176
00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.805
- Yeah.
-My American friend is on vacation.

177
00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.223
I wanna show him a good time.

178
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.058
Oh, you American.

179
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.728
- Yeah.
-You bring American money?

180
00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:57.105
- I got it, Lee.
-No.

181
00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:58.356
- I got it.
-You sure?

182
00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.816
I'm sure.

183
00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.651
- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

184
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.278
Right this way, gentlemen.

185
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.581
Are you ready?

186
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.499
You ready?

187
00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:17.751
I'm ready.

188
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.633
Oh, my goodness!

189
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.928
This place is off the hook!
I love Hong Kong.

190
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.930
You get massage
from Chinese girl before?

191
00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.265
No, but I heard it was the bomb.

192
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:33.892
Come with me.

193
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:37.270
You pick any girl for you
and your friend.

194
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.272
- Any girl?
-Any girl.

195
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.900
Okay.

196
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.028
I don't know where to start.

197
00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:50.992
<i>- I’ll</i> take that one. She got to come.
- Oh, yes, she's very nice.

198
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.328
She is nice,
but I hurt my back and my neck...

199
00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:55.080
...I need a little bit more massage.

200
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.915
So I'm gonna take her
in the pink too.

201
00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.583
Oh, yes.

202
00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.960
Let me get her. Hey, baby.

203
00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.712
And then let me have her.
Can I get her too?

204
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.923
And her right there.
She good with feet?

205
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.175
- Oh, yes.
-What are you doing?

206
00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.678
She said I could have any girl I want
in here. Wait.

207
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.471
Well, hurry up!

208
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.724
Man, you don’t jump
in front of a black man in a buffet line.

209
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:15.976
Calm down!

210
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.062
- I have to--
-Your friend has big appetite.

211
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:23.525
Please, follow her upstairs
into the quiet room.

212
00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:26.486
It ain't gonna be no quiet room
no more.

213
00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.405
And a--

214
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.115
Oh.

215
00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:34.619
Y'all don't know how good this feels.

216
00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.830
I got in a big fight last night
with the Triads.

217
00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:39.374
Ever heard of the Triads?
I beat down like 20 of them.

218
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.210
Y'all should've seen me, it was on.
Oh.

219
00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.379
- Lee.Lee.
-Yeah?

220
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.381
This is what I'm talking about, man.

221
00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:48.091
Now I'm on vacation.

222
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:51.386
I knew you'd come through.
I just knew it.

223
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.346
America?

224
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.515
Wanna come to America with me?

225
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.600
Ever been to America?

226
00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.144
Lee, how's your girl?

227
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.814
- Lee, what's wrong?
-That's Ricky Tan.

228
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.315
That's Ricky Tan?

229
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.276
That's a midget in a bathrobe!

230
00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:07.819
I will call for backup.

231
00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.572
Lee, the man is 4 feet tall.
Let's go bust him right now.

232
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.906
- No.
- No?

233
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.700
He's a very dangerous man.

234
00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.243
I'm a very dangerous man.

235
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.495
Now, look, let's go over there
and bust him, man.

236
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.748
You're not about to mess up
my massage.

237
00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:21.416
- Stay here.
-You don't need backup.

238
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.917
I got your back--

239
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.758
Excuse me for a minute.
Just for a minute.

240
00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:34.012
I'll be back. Don't--

241
00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.639
I'll be back.

242
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.851
Ricky?

243
00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:41.144
Ricky Tan?

244
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.521
Get up, dog.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

245
00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.982
I'm busy at the moment.

246
00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.651
Did you hear what I said?
I'm busy too. Now get on your feet.

247
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:49.944
Get up! Get on your feet!

248
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:51.529
I know you.

249
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.281
You are Lee's American friend, right?

250
00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:56.785
No. I'm Lee's new muscle.
And don't let this robe fool you.

251
00:17:56.951 --> 00:17:59.871
This is the only color they had left.
Now I said, get up.

252
00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.164
I ain't gonna say it again.

253
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.794
You American are so funny.

254
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.129
And you Asians don't hear that well.

255
00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.841
Little Ricky.

256
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.345
Get your little punk ass up...

257
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:18.515
...out of that chair right now!

258
00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:22.936
You're messing up my vacation.
Now, I told you to get up, didn't I?

259
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.729
- Now I gotta go off on you.
-No.

260
00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.022
Let me bust his ass.

261
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.608
Let me take care of this.

262
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.670
Look, little man. You coming with--

263
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.713
Oh, my Lord.

264
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.342
I would like to pay you for that laptop.
I think I should do that.

265
00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.010
- No problem.
-I can get you a new one.

266
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:57.804
Seen it on the internet
with DVD player.

267
00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.265
- That's an old model.
-Now, I must excuse myself.

268
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:01.891
Inspector.

269
00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.977
Have a good day.

270
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.773
I was...

271
00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:14.904
Lee, why didn't you tell me
this man rolls like this?

272
00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.197
- I told you!
-You didn't!

273
00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.615
- I did.
-What you said?

274
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.826
- I did this:
-What do this...mean, man?

275
00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.203
- Speak English to me!
-That means I go this way...

276
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.372
...you, this way.
-I go that way, you, this way?

277
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.207
- Yes.
-Okay.

278
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.682
- Unh!
-Sorry, man.

279
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.475
- Carter!
-All y'all look alike!

280
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.352
Watch out!

281
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.791
Carter!

282
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.335
Lee!

283
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.841
- Oh!
- No wonder you mad.

284
00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.273
Don't worry. It's okay.

285
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:37.195
You better get the hell out of here.

286
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.452
Lee!

287
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.247
- Flip me!
-What?

288
00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:48.957
Flip me!

289
00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.584
Damn!

290
00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:52.961
Lee!

291
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:54.462
Whoa!

292
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:06.849
No, no, no! No!

293
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.393
- Lee!
-Watch out!

294
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:32.333
Lee!

295
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:49.809
No, no. Look, you've been ordered
by the Ministry of Public Security...

296
00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.730
...to assist the FBI
and Secret Service in our investigation...

297
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:56.316
...to provide us
with whatever we need.

298
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:59.902
You have information,
it belongs to us.

299
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.905
This is still Hong Kong.

300
00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:06.951
Two Americans have been killed
on United States government property.

301
00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.578
Give me two copies of that.

302
00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.997
This is our investigation.

303
00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:14.167
Chief Inspector Lee
will supervise your people.

304
00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:18.880
No, he will report to me.
Do we understand each other?

305
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.512
What the hell is that?

306
00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:31.142
That is, uh, Chief Inspector Lee.

307
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:33.936
Ain't never been humiliated
and embarrassed like that...

308
00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:35.563
...in my whole entire life.

309
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.233
Got me running around Hong Kong
butt-naked, thanks to you.

310
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.194
- Thanks to me?
-Yeah, thanks to you.

311
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:43.404
You needed backup,
so I gave you backup.

312
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.990
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass,
and his bodyguards'...

313
00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:47.492
...till you messed it up.
-Stop.

314
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:49.535
- I’m sick of your bullshit.
-I’m sick of you!

315
00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:52.413
I'm not the one running up
in karaoke bars full of gangsters.

316
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.792
I'm not the one running up in massage
parlors looking for crime lords.

317
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.835
- It's my job.
-It's your job.

318
00:22:58.002 --> 00:23:00.546
You pitiful, man.
When are you gonna have some fun?

319
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.758
When are you gonna take a day off?
Go on a date or something?

320
00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.635
- I have plenty of dates.
-When?

321
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:07.470
When's the last time
you had a date, huh?

322
00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:10.223
When's the last time
you played Hide the Rainbow Roll, huh?

323
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.934
Let's hear it, Lee. The year of the rat?

324
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.019
You will never understand me.

325
00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:18.356
You right. I didn't even understand
what you just said to me right then.

326
00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:27.115
They got my passport
back at that massage parlor.

327
00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.911
Good afternoon, sir.

328
00:23:32.078 --> 00:23:33.246
- Lee.
-Yes, sir.

329
00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:37.375
This is Special Agent Sterling
from the United States Secret Service.

330
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.293
Secret Service? Why?

331
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.546
Have a seat, please.

332
00:23:42.713 --> 00:23:45.925
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

333
00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:49.929
The men who were killed yesterday
were not American translators.

334
00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:52.557
They were undercover
United States customs agents...

335
00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:54.725
...trying to break
a Triad smuggling ring.

336
00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:56.686
- Smuggling what?
-We don't know.

337
00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:58.896
But whatever it is,
it got the agents killed.

338
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:02.984
How can we help you?

339
00:24:03.151 --> 00:24:05.319
You can stay the hell out of our way.

340
00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:09.532
Thank you.

341
00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:11.367
I can get you Ricky Tan.

342
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.953
No. We know all about Tan.

343
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.122
That's why we're leaving him out there
as bait.

344
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:21.711
This is a lot bigger than Ricky Tan
and the Fu Cang Long Triads.

345
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.759
Hey, cutie.

346
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:51.991
Thank you, Lee.

347
00:25:21.604 --> 00:25:23.481
Carter! Carter!

348
00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:28.277
Uh, Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

349
00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:31.447
Heaven on Earth?

350
00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:34.534
Hello. Cheap suits.

351
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.870
Hello. Cheap suits. Cheap suits.

352
00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:39.455
Cheap suits. Cheap suits.

353
00:25:39.622 --> 00:25:41.499
- How cheap?
-Cheap suits.

354
00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.084
Cheap as hell?

355
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:01.310
Excuse me.

356
00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:02.562
Can you direct me...

357
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.689
...to Heaven on Earth massage parlor,
please?

358
00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.607
- Hello. How are you?
-Okay.

359
00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:10.528
No, no. Wait a minute.

360
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:12.655
No. I don't want no chicken.

361
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:16.993
No, no, no. Aah!

362
00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:20.079
No! I don't want no chicken.
What am I gonna do with a chicken?

363
00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:22.957
I don't like my chickens live, okay?

364
00:26:23.124 --> 00:26:25.585
I like them dead and deep-fried.
You ever heard of Popeye's?

365
00:26:28.004 --> 00:26:29.171
No, no! No!

366
00:26:29.338 --> 00:26:31.257
Heh. Don't kill chicken.

367
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:32.800
- Oh.
-Yes.

368
00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:34.844
Aah! I'm warning you.

369
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:38.514
I'm a police officer. Put the blade down
and let the bird go right now!

370
00:26:46.856 --> 00:26:48.608
You okay, Lee?

371
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:54.238
All he wanted was some mu shu.

372
00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.838
Damn.

373
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:13.883
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

374
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.385
Hey! Hey!

375
00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:19.305
Follow that car.

376
00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:23.142
Hey, follow that limo.
This is a chase, okay?

377
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:24.435
Wherever he goes, you go.

378
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:28.064
You're not moving!
This is the opposite of chasing!

379
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:32.360
What? I will slap you
if you don't move this car.

380
00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:34.528
I'm gonna slap you.
I'm gonna slap you.

381
00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:38.199
Okay. All right. Okay, look.

382
00:27:38.366 --> 00:27:40.451
Here. You understand that?

383
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:45.790
Now you're speaking my language.

384
00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:48.668
Get the hell on then.
Come on, Let's go!

385
00:27:58.302 --> 00:27:59.887
<i>This right here, tell you what</i>

386
00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:03.265
<i>Goes out to everyone</i>

387
00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.226
<i>That has lost someone</i>

388
00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:07.561
<i>That they truly loved
Check it out</i>

389
00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:09.980
<i>Seems like yesterday
We used to rock the show</i>

390
00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:12.024
<i>I laced the track, you locked the flow</i>

391
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:14.360
<i>So far from hangin'
On the block for dough</i>

392
00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:16.654
<i>Notorious, they got to know that</i>

393
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:18.823
<i>Life ain't always what it seem to be</i>

394
00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:20.825
<i>Words can't express
What you mean to me</i>

395
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:23.035
<i>Even though you're gone
We still a team</i>

396
00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:25.329
<i>Through your family
I'll fulfill your dreams</i>

397
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:28.124
<i>In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me</i>

398
00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:31.919
<i>Reminisce sometime
The night they took my friend</i>

399
00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:34.422
<i>Try to black it out, but it plays again</i>

400
00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:19.425
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

401
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:22.470
- You understand?
-Yes, I understand.

402
00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:25.055
- And don't eat my chicken, okay?
-Okay, okay.

403
00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:26.307
-Okay.
-Okay.

404
00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:27.641
Jesus.

405
00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:30.102
Hey! Hey!

406
00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:52.268
How you doing, baby?

407
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:56.021
Carter. James Carter. Baldwin hills.

408
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.232
Isabella Molina. From San Juan.

409
00:30:58.399 --> 00:30:59.608
- San Juan?
Mm-hm.

410
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:03.404
I know San Juan. I've traveled there
many times on my private plane.

411
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:04.905
You must know my good friend...

412
00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:08.868
...Pedro Morales Magonzales
Marato Molaso Mondustos.

413
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.744
- I don't think so, no.
-You sure?

414
00:31:10.911 --> 00:31:12.037
- Mm-hm.
-Well, I'm sorry.

415
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.081
I thought you rode
in the best of circles.

416
00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:16.166
But listen,
make yourself feel at home.

417
00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:18.961
You need anything,
champagne, caviar...

418
00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:20.629
...my yacht is your yacht.

419
00:31:22.298 --> 00:31:23.424
This is your yacht?

420
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:25.342
That's right. I'm the owner.

421
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:26.927
The captain.

422
00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.640
Yes. Listen.

423
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:35.477
I'm not gonna play games with you.
I want you, right now.

424
00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:38.439
I see me and you downstairs
in one of those bathrooms...

425
00:31:38.606 --> 00:31:40.441
...in about five minutes.

426
00:31:40.774 --> 00:31:43.903
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a beautiful yacht.

427
00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:47.364
What's it called?

428
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:50.367
- What's it called?
-Mm-hm. Your yacht.

429
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:51.869
<i>The S.S. Minnow Johnson.</i>

430
00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:54.538
<i>- The S.S. Minnow Johnson?
Noah.</i>

431
00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:57.583
Funny. The name on the back
was the <i>Red</i> Dragon.

432
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.501
<i>The Red Dragon? Are you sure'?</i>

433
00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:00.794
Oh, I'm sure.

434
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:02.713
Because this is my friend's yacht.

435
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.174
- Your friend's yacht?
-And this is his party.

436
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:06.884
I must've got on the wrong yacht.

437
00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:09.011
All these yachts look just alike
these days.

438
00:32:09.178 --> 00:32:12.640
I knew something was wrong
when my key didn't work.

439
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:16.393
- Who's your friend?
-Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

440
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.355
Hey, wait a second.
I know you. Steven Reign, right?

441
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:22.733
You own half of Los Angeles.
What you doing out here in Hong Kong?

442
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.985
I'm here for the weekend,
taking in the sights.

443
00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:28.197
You must have your own plane too.
It's fun, ain't it?

444
00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:31.241
- Shall we?
-Yes.

445
00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:34.536
Well, enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

446
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.622
I plan to, Miss Isabella.

447
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:40.167
See you later, Stevie. Be cool.

448
00:32:53.555 --> 00:32:55.474
Ricky Tan. Where is he?

449
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:56.725
I don't know!

450
00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:59.645
He killed a detective today.
Where is he?

451
00:32:59.812 --> 00:33:01.897
Who got killed, man?

452
00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:04.650
- Carter!
-Who died, Lee?

453
00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:06.735
- You!
-Detective Yu?

454
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:08.112
Not Yu, you!

455
00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:09.405
-Who?
-You!

456
00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:11.156
Who?

457
00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:14.201
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

458
00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:17.705
Don't nobody understand the words
that are coming out of your mouth, man.

459
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.499
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.

460
00:33:26.088 --> 00:33:28.132
What the hell is going on here, Lee?

461
00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:30.259
Remember I told you
my father was a policeman?

462
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:32.011
- Yeah.
-Ricky Tan was his partner.

463
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:33.262
What?

464
00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:56.744
Lee, I've been expecting you.

465
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.537
Please ask your partner to wait inside.

466
00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:01.290
- Hell, no. I ain't going nowhere.
-It's okay.

467
00:34:01.457 --> 00:34:03.834
- I’m not leaving you alone, Lee.
<i>- I’ll be fine.</i>

468
00:34:04.001 --> 00:34:05.169
- You sure?
-Yes.

469
00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:09.798
I'll be right upstairs.

470
00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:14.553
I know what everybody's saying.

471
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.765
I did not blow up
the American embassy.

472
00:34:18.098 --> 00:34:19.767
I'm not that stupid.

473
00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:23.937
But I believe some of my people did.

474
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:27.649
My enemies are trying to frame me.

475
00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:31.403
There is a war going on right now
within the Triads.

476
00:34:32.446 --> 00:34:34.406
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose this time.

477
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:39.328
If your father were still alive,
I would turn to him for advice.

478
00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:41.371
Please don't.

479
00:34:41.538 --> 00:34:44.708
Lee, I really need your help.
I cannot trust anybody else.

480
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.461
Tell me why they killed
the customs agents.

481
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.214
I'll give you
all the information you need.

482
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.510
But you've gotta get me
out of Hong Kong right away.

483
00:35:36.677 --> 00:35:38.387
Hey, lady, what are you doing?

484
00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:39.888
Get down. I'm L.A.P.D.

485
00:35:42.683 --> 00:35:44.059
You just kick me?

486
00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:46.311
You must be out of your mind!

487
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:47.563
You want some of me?

488
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.773
I'm gonna give you
an L.A.P.D. ass-kicking!

489
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.801
- You okay?
-Yeah.

490
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:20.137
I slipped and I fell.

491
00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:21.430
- Hey.
-What?

492
00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:23.265
Am I bleeding?

493
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:38.447
Quite a night, inspector.

494
00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:42.075
Ricky Tan was our only bait.
Now he's gone.

495
00:36:42.242 --> 00:36:43.577
So you got your revenge.

496
00:36:43.994 --> 00:36:46.663
At the expense of a
United States government investigation.

497
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.707
Revenge? What are you talking about,
revenge?

498
00:36:48.874 --> 00:36:51.710
Now, I don't know
if the Triads paid you to get rid of Tan...

499
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:53.921
...or if it was a pure vendetta killing...

500
00:36:54.087 --> 00:36:56.632
...or if you're involved
in the smuggling yourself.

501
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:57.925
But you're off this case.

502
00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:00.135
I don't ever wanna see you again.
ls that clear?

503
00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:02.930
- Hey, what's going on here?
-Carter, you're in enough trouble.

504
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:04.181
Just shut up.

505
00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:05.974
Stay out of it.

506
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:08.143
You're going back to L.A. right now.

507
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.563
Hey, that's fine with me, man.
I ain't had fun since I been out here.

508
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.482
Okay.

509
00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:17.736
Sorry, Lee.

510
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:22.783
- Escort Detective Carter to the airport.
-No.

511
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:25.077
I'll take him.

512
00:37:25.244 --> 00:37:26.620
Get your hands off!

513
00:37:34.336 --> 00:37:36.797
Carter, you don't understand.

514
00:37:36.964 --> 00:37:38.423
Oh, I understand all right.

515
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.717
I got knocked off a building,
I got beat on...

516
00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:44.471
...I got stripped butt-naked,
and you held out on me, man.

517
00:37:44.638 --> 00:37:46.473
I'm out of here.

518
00:37:53.313 --> 00:37:56.358
Carter, Ricky Tan set up my father.

519
00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:59.278
What?

520
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:08.287
Five years ago, my father was working
a big international smuggling case.

521
00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:11.290
He found out his partner, Tan,
was working for the Triads.

522
00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:15.544
But before he could prove it,
he was killed.

523
00:38:15.711 --> 00:38:17.504
All the evidence disappeared.

524
00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:20.173
Tan resigned,
and the case was never solved.

525
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:24.803
So I get it now.
This is all about your daddy's last case.

526
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:32.185
So you getting on the plane with me
or not'?

527
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:33.437
What?

528
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:36.231
You know
my daddy died on the job too.

529
00:38:36.398 --> 00:38:39.318
If I had a chance to square his death,
I'd do whatever it took.

530
00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:41.278
I'd do anything.

531
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:42.863
So you coming or what?

532
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.078
Why L.A.'?

533
00:38:53.623 --> 00:38:54.833
Lee, let me introduce you...

534
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.336
...to Carter's
theory of criminal investigation:

535
00:38:57.502 --> 00:38:58.920
Follow the rich white man.

536
00:38:59.463 --> 00:39:02.883
- Follow the rich white man?
-Exactly. Now you're learning.

537
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.177
Every big crime
has a rich white man behind it...

538
00:39:05.344 --> 00:39:06.428
...waiting for his cut.

539
00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:08.889
Now, in our case,
we know who the rich white man is.

540
00:39:09.056 --> 00:39:10.474
- Steven Reign.
-Who?

541
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.852
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.
I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

542
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:16.146
When the shooting started,
he was way too cool.

543
00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:18.899
When people start shooting,
white people ain't that cool.

544
00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:21.401
They either running around,
hiding behind tables...

545
00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:23.779
...or screaming like, "Aah!"

546
00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:26.281
- Shh.
- You sound like that all the time.

547
00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:28.075
Tell you something
about black people.

548
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:30.702
When stuff goes down,
we keep our cool.

549
00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:34.081
Maybe, but not like Asians.
We never panic.

550
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:36.625
Yeah, right. When Godzilla's coming,
y'all be tripping.

551
00:39:36.792 --> 00:39:37.876
I seen the movie.

552
00:39:38.043 --> 00:39:39.711
<i>- You be, "Gaica, gaica!"
- Carter.</i>

553
00:39:39.878 --> 00:39:41.004
- Yelling everywhere.
-Just--

554
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:43.006
Mr. Carter, excuse me.

555
00:39:43.173 --> 00:39:44.257
Thank you so much.

556
00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:46.551
- It's the kosher meal?
-Yes, sir, our kosher meal.

557
00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.220
Shalom.

558
00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:04.903
There he is. Mr. Steven Reign.

559
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.365
Living large
in one of his penthouse suites.

560
00:40:09.908 --> 00:40:13.453
Oh, guess who this is.
Yep, that's her.

561
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.415
That's the woman that was on
Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

562
00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:18.166
We got them.

563
00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:20.961
Told you it'd work out.
Know what I'm talking about.

564
00:40:21.128 --> 00:40:23.380
All we gotta do now is wait.

565
00:40:24.506 --> 00:40:26.091
- They still talking?
-Mm-hm.

566
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:29.010
He's leaving.

567
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:31.096
- He'll be back.
-How do you know?

568
00:40:31.263 --> 00:40:33.348
I know.
You see how fine that woman is?

569
00:40:33.515 --> 00:40:35.559
He'll definitely be back.

570
00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:43.692
What's she doing?

571
00:40:44.526 --> 00:40:46.027
Huh?

572
00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:48.238
What's she doing, man?

573
00:40:48.405 --> 00:40:51.158
She's just standing around,
not doing much.

574
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:52.534
Well, just don't fall asleep.

575
00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:55.203
Sooner or later,
something's gonna happen.

576
00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:59.708
Okay, I just try to stay awake.
It's just so boring.

577
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.548
Ah. Slow down, baby.

578
00:41:06.715 --> 00:41:07.799
What?

579
00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:10.719
Huh? Nothing. I said nothing.

580
00:41:10.886 --> 00:41:12.679
- You said something.
-I said nothing.

581
00:41:12.846 --> 00:41:15.765
- I heard you say something.
-No, no, no. Nothing.

582
00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:30.238
Lee, what's going on, man?
What you talking about?

583
00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:33.283
- She's getting undressed.
-What?

584
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.160
- She's getting undressed.
-Give me that.

585
00:41:35.327 --> 00:41:36.786
No!

586
00:41:36.953 --> 00:41:38.872
It's not right!

587
00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:41.583
- Lord, have mercy!
- What?

588
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:44.211
- She took her skirt off.
-Oh, I cannot hear this.

589
00:41:44.586 --> 00:41:46.713
Black panties, black bra.

590
00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:50.717
Victoria's Secret,
spring catalog, page 27.

591
00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:52.552
Girl got class.

592
00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:54.221
Let me look a little closer.

593
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:57.265
Oh, look at that. Got a little tattoo.
That's cute.

594
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:59.935
Looks like Snoopy.

595
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:01.186
- Snoopy?
-Yeah.

596
00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:03.021
- I love Snoopy.
-Wait. I love Snoopy too.

597
00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:04.773
Let me look at this thing.

598
00:42:05.315 --> 00:42:06.816
Hold up. Wait a minute.

599
00:42:06.983 --> 00:42:09.528
She's going to the door. Wait.
She's going to the door.

600
00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:12.989
She's opening the door.

601
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.409
Look like somebody dropping off
a package.

602
00:42:16.576 --> 00:42:18.370
Wait a minute.

603
00:42:18.954 --> 00:42:22.207
Look like the same girl who dropped off
the package at your office.

604
00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.042
- It's a bomb!
-Bomb!

605
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.170
Watch out! Watch out!

606
00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:34.511
It's this one right here, I think.
Hey, you got a bomb in there!

607
00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:36.471
Open the door!

608
00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:38.431
Kick the door.

609
00:42:39.558 --> 00:42:41.393
- What the he--?
- No, no, no!

610
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.020
- Damn, you fine.
- Carter!

611
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.190
- Come on, Lee! Come on!
-Where? Where?

612
00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:50.777
- Don't drop it! Come on, this way!
-Where should we go?

613
00:42:55.323 --> 00:42:56.825
Roof! Roof!

614
00:42:56.992 --> 00:42:59.744
Don't trip! Be careful!

615
00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:04.207
- Throw it, Lee!
- Where?

616
00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:05.458
- Throw it!
- Where?

617
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.128
Throw the bomb over the edge!
Throw it.

618
00:43:08.295 --> 00:43:10.130
Throw it! Throw it over the edge!

619
00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:12.007
- There's people down there!
- Throw it!

620
00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:13.842
- Carter! Carter!
-Lee!

621
00:43:14.009 --> 00:43:15.093
- Lee!
-Carter!

622
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.344
- Throw it!
-No!

623
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.597
We about to die!

624
00:43:25.604 --> 00:43:27.522
Okay, get on your feet.

625
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.899
- Enough!
-Put that down!

626
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:31.776
- It's a bomb! hey!
-Put that down!

627
00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:34.821
Guys, no bomb. Nothing.

628
00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:38.491
Now stay away before I throw you both
in jail for obstruction.

629
00:43:38.658 --> 00:43:40.577
Throw us in jail?

630
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:43.580
You must be out of your mind.
I'm about to bust you right now.

631
00:43:43.747 --> 00:43:46.666
I'm an undercover agent
for the United States Secret Service.

632
00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:48.460
How do we know that?
Show me a badge.

633
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:50.587
Here you go.

634
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:56.051
Let me see that again.
I didn't get a good look at that.

635
00:43:56.217 --> 00:43:59.137
We can help you.
I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

636
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:01.556
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
I know.

637
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:02.932
We need to go out of sight.

638
00:44:03.224 --> 00:44:05.268
So come down to my suite.

639
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:10.607
- Now why did you say it was a bomb?
-No, you said that.

640
00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:12.859
- No, you said it.
-You said that in the hotel room.

641
00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:15.528
I said she was the bomb.

642
00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:18.740
She was the bomb?

643
00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:21.618
Now, look, I've been working this case
for months now.

644
00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:25.038
- So if I seem aggravated, I apologize.
-You need to tell us what's going on.

645
00:44:25.455 --> 00:44:28.541
The Triads and Reign, they think
I'm a crooked customs agent.

646
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:29.876
Is that a payoff?

647
00:44:30.043 --> 00:44:32.337
No. That's a sample.

648
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:34.005
You guys ever heard of the Superbill?

649
00:44:34.172 --> 00:44:36.007
Yeah. It's a myth.
Some kind of counterfeit.

650
00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:39.928
Honey, it's much more
than a counterfeit.

651
00:44:40.095 --> 00:44:43.181
Fourteen out of 15 world banks
can't even tell the difference.

652
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:44.849
The paper is Crane linen blend...

653
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:48.103
...and the bills are printed
on U.S. intaglio presses.

654
00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:50.689
Tell us how they get
into the U.S. mint to use the presses.

655
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:54.776
In 1959, the United States
was very friendly with the shah of Iran.

656
00:44:54.943 --> 00:44:57.028
Why? Because we wanted his oil.

657
00:44:57.195 --> 00:44:59.280
Our government gave him a gift.

658
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:01.241
A U.S. treasury intaglio printing press.

659
00:45:01.408 --> 00:45:03.660
Now, it's the only one
to ever leave the country.

660
00:45:03.827 --> 00:45:06.246
Five years ago, Ricky bought the press
on the black market.

661
00:45:06.413 --> 00:45:07.956
- Five years ago?
Mm-hm.

662
00:45:08.123 --> 00:45:11.835
- That's right before he left the force.
-Earlier this year, Ricky Tan got ahold...

663
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.837
...of Swiss-made
hundred dollar plates...

664
00:45:14.003 --> 00:45:16.005
...and he started printing Superbills.

665
00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:18.800
That's why Hu Li killed him.
For the plates.

666
00:45:19.384 --> 00:45:23.555
And they've printed and shipped
$100 million.

667
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:28.560
There's only one way to spot a fake.

668
00:45:28.727 --> 00:45:31.771
They use an optical transfer ink
from India that burns red.

669
00:45:31.938 --> 00:45:35.734
You see?
Now, the real ink, it burns black.

670
00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:39.612
So, what in the hell they gonna do
with a hundred million of phony money?

671
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:42.657
You know, Carter, I believe
you're asking the wrong question.

672
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.786
The real question
is where are the plates?

673
00:45:46.953 --> 00:45:50.039
If we can find the plates,
we can stop the whole operation.

674
00:45:50.206 --> 00:45:53.168
- Right?
-Yeah, you're right.

675
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.795
Maybe this is where
you can help us, guys.

676
00:45:56.129 --> 00:45:59.507
Yeah. I mean,
Carter, this is your city, right?

677
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:02.093
Yeah, this is my titty--
I mean, this is my city.

678
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.344
Great.

679
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.306
And Lee, you know Hu Li
and the Triads, correct?

680
00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:08.683
- Yes.
- Great.

681
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.268
So can you do me a favor?

682
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:12.771
Can you find out
where Hu Li's keeping the plates?

683
00:46:12.937 --> 00:46:15.064
- That ain't no problem.
- Thank you.

684
00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:16.900
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.

685
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:19.152
From this moment on,
you're officially working...

686
00:46:19.319 --> 00:46:21.196
...for the
United States Secret Service.

687
00:46:23.823 --> 00:46:26.493
Secret Service agent James Carter.

688
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:29.871
Aw, that sounds good.
It's got a nice ring to it, don't it?

689
00:46:30.038 --> 00:46:32.749
I'm telling you, give me six months.
Six months.

690
00:46:32.916 --> 00:46:35.460
I'm gonna be in Washington, D.C.
protecting the president.

691
00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:38.213
We both know you would never
take a bullet for someone else.

692
00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:39.881
Yeah, but they don't know that.

693
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:42.550
I'm gonna talk to Isabella,
see if she can hook something up.

694
00:46:42.717 --> 00:46:44.511
Seeing the way she was staring
at a brother.

695
00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:46.846
She never even looked at you.

696
00:46:47.013 --> 00:46:49.557
Just jealous, Lee,
because the girl chose me.

697
00:46:49.724 --> 00:46:53.144
Because I'm tall, dark and handsome.
And you Third World ugly.

698
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:55.522
I'm not Third World ugly.
Women like me.

699
00:46:55.688 --> 00:46:58.566
They think I'm cute, like Snoopy.

700
00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:01.736
Lee, Snoopy is 6 inches taller
than you.

701
00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:07.575
- Sterling.
- Lee and Carter are officially...

702
00:47:07.742 --> 00:47:09.202
...out of the Secret Service's way.

703
00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:10.912
Correct.

704
00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:31.224
This is my informant's place.

705
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:32.892
They got pretty good ribs here too.

706
00:47:33.059 --> 00:47:35.103
I like kosher.

707
00:47:43.736 --> 00:47:45.154
Hey. Hey, wait.

708
00:47:53.162 --> 00:47:56.499
Oh, I know I don't think I see
what I see what I'm thinking!

709
00:47:56.666 --> 00:47:58.793
I know good and well
y'all ain't gambling back here!

710
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.753
This is supposed to be
a Chinese restaurant!

711
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.171
What you doing in here, James?

712
00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:05.508
You about to go to jail. You about to go
to jail, and all your little friends.

713
00:48:05.675 --> 00:48:06.759
Pack up your stuff!

714
00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:08.052
- Let's go!
-All right.

715
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:10.054
- Let's talk outside.
-You wanna talk outside?

716
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:12.348
- Yes.
-Let's go then. You wanna talk.

717
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:14.225
As long as you wanna talk.

718
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.606
Where you get that from? I like that.

719
00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:22.150
That's good. What's up, Kenny?

720
00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:25.069
- James Carter.
-What's up?

721
00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:28.948
I heard you was getting your ass kicked
out there in Hong Kong.

722
00:48:29.115 --> 00:48:30.199
- What?
-That's right.

723
00:48:31.618 --> 00:48:33.620
- You crazy. Who told you that?
-I got my sources.

724
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:35.955
- Don't you worry about that.
-They telling you lies.

725
00:48:36.122 --> 00:48:38.750
I'm about to bust you
if you don't give me some information.

726
00:48:38.917 --> 00:48:42.045
How you gonna come up here
and jam me up like this, James? Huh?

727
00:48:42.211 --> 00:48:46.090
You embarrass me in front of my wife,
my kids out there.

728
00:48:46.257 --> 00:48:47.842
Kenny, you embarrassing yourself.

729
00:48:48.009 --> 00:48:50.929
You a black man
with a Chinese restaurant on Crenshaw.

730
00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:54.182
You come up in here,
you ain't show me no badge.

731
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:55.975
You ain't even flashed a warrant.

732
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:59.938
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna whup your ass.

733
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.357
And then I'm gonna whup your ass.

734
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:05.026
Kenny, we'd love to see that.
We would want--

735
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:07.570
- Come on, Kenny! Come on, Kenny!
-Come on!

736
00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:09.739
- Do it!
<i>- I’ll</i> shoot, say you fell in the kitchen.

737
00:49:09.906 --> 00:49:11.532
- Come on!
-You better chill out, boy.

738
00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:14.452
- Kenny, calm down!
-Hey , what--?

739
00:49:19.624 --> 00:49:20.792
Kenny!

740
00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:26.923
Twisting tiger.

741
00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:31.219
Where did you learn that?

742
00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:40.061
They're brothers.

743
00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:42.438
Oh, all right, all right.

744
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:46.234
7-11?

745
00:49:51.364 --> 00:49:55.243
Hey! I heard that. I heard that.

746
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.453
Don't be talking about me, man.

747
00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.205
You are here
about some funny money.

748
00:49:59.372 --> 00:50:00.540
How you know?

749
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:04.127
- C-notes, right?
-Yeah. Any of them came through here?

750
00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:08.715
One of my regulars came in here
a few days ago...

751
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:11.384
...dropped about 50 large
on the tables in there.

752
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:14.470
I was about to go down there
with my boys and tune his ass up.

753
00:50:14.637 --> 00:50:16.639
But he comes in the next day
with the whole thing.

754
00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:19.475
Brand-new 100-dollar bills, sequential.

755
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:22.353
I figure they're fake
because this guy's got a regular day job.

756
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.897
So I test them, and they checked out.

757
00:50:25.064 --> 00:50:26.315
You still have the bills?

758
00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:29.736
Still got my lunch money
from the third grade.

759
00:50:29.902 --> 00:50:31.070
Let me see them.

760
00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:56.679
Hold it. What are you doing?

761
00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:02.643
Whoa.

762
00:51:03.144 --> 00:51:04.228
Oh, it's fake.

763
00:51:04.729 --> 00:51:05.813
He got you.

764
00:51:06.147 --> 00:51:07.315
Who you say gave that to you?

765
00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:09.609
Cat named Zing.
Work down at Reign Plaza.

766
00:51:09.776 --> 00:51:12.070
Tell you what, you better hope
you find him before I do.

767
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:13.321
All right.

768
00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:40.223
Excuse me. L.A.P.D.

769
00:51:40.389 --> 00:51:42.809
We're looking for a guy named Zing.

770
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:47.230
- You!
- Come here! Come back here!

771
00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.941
Hey! Hey! You little rascal!

772
00:51:50.108 --> 00:51:51.943
Get back here!

773
00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.986
Get back here right now!

774
00:52:13.089 --> 00:52:15.842
Heh. You know what?
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.

775
00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:17.301
I ain't even Chinese.

776
00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:19.303
All right, I'm sorry.

777
00:52:21.097 --> 00:52:24.183
I think there's someone
who would like to talk to them first.

778
00:52:34.068 --> 00:52:35.778
What'd you do that for? Unnecessary!

779
00:52:41.868 --> 00:52:44.579
You done knocked out my filling, girl.
That's gonna cost you.

780
00:52:45.288 --> 00:52:46.706
Ah!

781
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:48.791
Ah.

782
00:52:48.958 --> 00:52:51.586
I ain't never hit a woman,
but your ass is pushing it!

783
00:52:55.256 --> 00:52:56.424
Okay, all right, all right.

784
00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:58.259
<i>I’ll go.</i>

785
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:02.305
Better watch your back.

786
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.674
Lee.

787
00:53:38.841 --> 00:53:40.343
Lee!

788
00:53:41.052 --> 00:53:42.136
What happened?

789
00:53:42.303 --> 00:53:45.389
That lady Isabella knock you out,
that's what happened. She played you.

790
00:53:45.556 --> 00:53:46.807
- No.
-Yes, she did.

791
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:48.851
- She save our life.
-What?

792
00:53:49.018 --> 00:53:51.646
- Hu Li could have killed us.
-Lee, are you crazy, man?

793
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:53.105
Look at us. We good as dead!

794
00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:55.399
Stop your whining, Carter!

795
00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:59.195
What you gonna do if I don't stop, huh?
I will slap the hell out of you right now.

796
00:53:59.362 --> 00:54:01.322
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

797
00:54:01.614 --> 00:54:03.866
<i>- I’ll</i> bitch-slap you back to Africa!
- Oh, you will?

798
00:54:04.033 --> 00:54:05.493
- Yeah.
-Come on, let me see that.

799
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.828
- I wanna see you do that! Come on.
-Yeah?

800
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:09.580
You don't know
who you're messing with!

801
00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:11.624
You don't know
who you're messing with.

802
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.709
<i>- I’ll</i> bite your damn nose off, man.
- You bite--

803
00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:14.961
- Yeah.
-Come on!

804
00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:50.746
Some apple?

805
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.002
I'd put that knife away, bitch,
before you have an accident.

806
00:55:05.594 --> 00:55:07.722
Ain't no use, man.

807
00:55:08.264 --> 00:55:10.683
Just tell me
how the Triads are gonna kill us.

808
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.561
They will torture us for three days.

809
00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:18.024
- I can handle that.
-Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.

810
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:19.608
Cut off our egg rolls?

811
00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:21.861
Hell, no! Let's get the hell out of here!

812
00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:23.988
Come on, man! Don't give up!

813
00:55:31.746 --> 00:55:35.333
- I don't wanna die!
- Be quiet.

814
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.336
- Okay, give me your left leg.
-What for?

815
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:39.628
- Left leg!
-Aah!

816
00:55:39.795 --> 00:55:41.380
Like this.

817
00:55:42.006 --> 00:55:43.424
- Ugh.
-Aah!

818
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:44.800
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

819
00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:58.773
That's it. Bite that thing.

820
00:55:59.106 --> 00:56:01.025
Bite it! Bite it like a little monkey!

821
00:56:01.192 --> 00:56:03.027
Go on, bite it! There you go.

822
00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:05.488
Yank it! Use them tiger teeth!

823
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:09.116
Yeah! Grab it, pull on it!
You almost got it, that's it.

824
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:12.411
Oh, shit!

825
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:14.955
- What the hell?
- Wow.

826
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:17.375
Lee, untie me. Hurry up, man!

827
00:56:19.126 --> 00:56:21.253
All these statues full of money.

828
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.130
Ah.

829
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:32.723
Hello, Benjamin!

830
00:56:35.017 --> 00:56:38.229
- What are you doing?
-I’m taking this for evidence.

831
00:56:40.022 --> 00:56:41.357
Carter.

832
00:56:42.358 --> 00:56:46.112
- You feel that?
-Yeah, we slowing down, man.

833
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:03.546
- What happened?
<i>- I’ll</i> tell you what happened.

834
00:57:05.673 --> 00:57:07.633
Come on, Lee!

835
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:14.306
Carter, go up.

836
00:57:20.438 --> 00:57:23.190
Carter! Carter!

837
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:44.253
- Carter!
- Lee!

838
00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:46.505
- What happened?
-You left me.

839
00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:49.049
I didn't leave you, man.
I was waiting up there for you.

840
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:05.941
Whoa, man! I ain't going in there!

841
00:58:06.108 --> 00:58:07.735
- Come on!
-There's rats in there!

842
00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:10.070
- There's no rats!
-Look at that rat!

843
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.822
Ugh!

844
00:58:32.343 --> 00:58:33.552
Las Vegas?

845
00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:38.182
Vegas?
What the hell we doing in Vegas?

846
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:40.809
Look. Red Dragon.

847
00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:43.646
That's the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

848
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:45.356
Lee.

849
00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:49.109
That's how you launder
a hundred million dollars in cash.

850
00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:50.736
- Let's go.
-Let's go.

851
00:58:52.154 --> 00:58:53.280
- Sorry.
-Damn!

852
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:56.075
One at a time.
What the hell is wrong with you?

853
00:59:00.996 --> 00:59:02.248
- Wait a second, man.
-What?

854
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:04.124
- We can't go in there like this.
-Why?

855
00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:06.544
- We gotta look fly.
-What you mean fly?

856
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.420
Mack out.
We can't go in there like this.

857
00:59:08.587 --> 00:59:10.005
What does it mean, mack out?

858
00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:12.341
Follow me, my Asian brother.
I'll show you.

859
00:59:12.508 --> 00:59:15.219
Come on. Come on.

860
00:59:22.393 --> 00:59:23.978
That's where we're going, right there.

861
00:59:24.144 --> 00:59:26.146
When we get there,
you stay a couple steps behind.

862
00:59:26.313 --> 00:59:27.731
- Huh?
- You smell funky.

863
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:30.609
I think you stepped in some rat shit.

864
00:59:30.776 --> 00:59:34.029
It was a cowboy hat,
and now it's a pith helmet, and once--

865
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:36.365
Hold up. I'll talk to you in a bit.

866
00:59:36.532 --> 00:59:38.033
Hi. Can I help you gentlemen?

867
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.828
Yeah.
I'm gonna need black, 42 long...

868
00:59:40.995 --> 00:59:43.122
...and nothing touches this body
but pure silk.

869
00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:45.416
Get my partner something
from the Kids Department.

870
00:59:45.583 --> 00:59:47.876
Would your partner like
to be wrapped in silk as well?

871
00:59:48.043 --> 00:59:49.461
Some people think it's tacky...

872
00:59:49.628 --> 00:59:51.630
...but I really enjoy it
when couples dress alike.

873
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:53.799
No, this ain't no couple thing, man.

874
00:59:53.966 --> 00:59:56.677
We're police officers. We're working
a case, and we need clothes.

875
00:59:56.844 --> 00:59:58.679
Yes.
There are a lot of men chasing us.

876
00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:01.682
As well they should be. Listen,
you have nothing to worry about, okay?

877
01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:03.851
I'm gonna turn you two
into the belle of the ball.

878
01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.185
- Thank you.
-Absolutely.

879
01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:06.812
Let's start with you, shall we?

880
01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.023
You've got the mochaccino face,
wonderful skin...

881
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.942
...and the big, broad shoulders.
Let's put a dead animal on you.

882
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.029
Croc skin. Butter cream, butter cream,
croc skin, butter cream.

883
01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:17.197
What size is the waist? Let's go in.

884
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:18.574
- I wanna--
-Hey!

885
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:19.825
Watch it, sweetness.

886
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.119
- He's got fire to him.
- Honey cups!

887
01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.371
- I like that.
- Go get the clothes! Hurry up!

888
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:26.624
I'll pull some items. Ooh, Jesus.

889
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.709
Ha, ha. Lil Kim, I'll be back.

890
01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:32.171
- You see that?
-He likes you.

891
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.965
I'm not shopping with you no more.

892
01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:44.808
Act like you're rich.

893
01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.602
Ladies and gentlemen...

894
01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:53.442
...Steven Reign, owner and founder
of the Red Dragon casino.

895
01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.152
Thank you.

896
01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.659
Thank you. Good evening.

897
01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:05.245
A thousand years ago,
a small, wealthy village in China...

898
01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.916
...hired a young dragon
to guard their treasures in a cave.

899
01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:12.670
The people of the village
started sneaking him extra food...

900
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.546
...hoping to make him stronger.

901
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:17.466
The dragon grew so big
he got stuck...

902
01:01:17.633 --> 01:01:22.846
...and the treasure
was trapped behind him for all eternity.

903
01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:27.184
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have found that lost treasure.

904
01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:32.690
It is here,
inside the greatest casino in the world!

905
01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.025
Welcome to the Red Dragon...

906
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.361
...where everybody is a winner!

907
01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:00.634
Black, 29.

908
01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:09.059
Look at this place, Lee.
It's the biggest front in the world.

909
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.936
Yeah, right--

910
01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.313
Hello.
drink?

911
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.149
Cigarettes?
WAITRESS 'l: Drink?

912
01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.320
Put your arms around me.

913
01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.322
- What?
-Hold me close.

914
01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:24.408
There are cameras everywhere.

915
01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:27.911
- What's going on?
-I think I may be in trouble, Lee.

916
01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.997
I really need your help.

917
01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.875
Last time you needed my help,
I woke up in a truck.

918
01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.669
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice.

919
01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:37.087
And you have to trust me.

920
01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.756
Look over my right shoulder.

921
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.174
That's the soft count room.

922
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.342
We think the plates are in there.

923
01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.511
I need you to go and get them.

924
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.054
Why don't you go get them?

925
01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.473
Because if I'm wrong...

926
01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:50.058
...then my entire cover is blown,
understand?

927
01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:53.437
How do I know I can trust you?

928
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.856
Dip me.

929
01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:00.819
I'm asking for real now.

930
01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.864
Will you help the Secret Service?

931
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:11.997
Hey, Lee. Lee!

932
01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.043
What are you doing?

933
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.795
Thank you, man. Take this.

934
01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:19.880
Dancing.

935
01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.131
Dancing?

936
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.509
I'm up here working,
putting my life on the line...

937
01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:26.470
...and you're up here messing around,
dancing with some bimbo?

938
01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:27.846
Does she have a friend?

939
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.389
That was Isabella.

940
01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.600
Says the plates
are in the soft count room.

941
01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:34.937
Lee, I know you didn't just say Isabella.
Are you crazy, man?

942
01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.064
- That girl is setting you up again.
-No.

943
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:39.900
- I’m gonna find out.
-No, wait, man.

944
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:44.780
There's security all over. If you're
gonna do this, you need a distraction.

945
01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:48.242
So keep your eye on me,
you'll know when to make your move.

946
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.535
- Good.
-Cool.

947
01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.669
Come on, roll them, big daddy!

948
01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.420
Come on, Tex! Come on, Tex!

949
01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:04.633
Hey, hey, hey! Good roll, man!

950
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.051
This table's hot!

951
01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:08.554
I want some of this money.
Get me in this game. Come on.

952
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.765
Sir, uh, are you aware that there's
a $50,000 buy-in this evening?

953
01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.059
If that's the case,
give me $100,000 in chips.

954
01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:16.270
Let me have a diet Pepsi
and some hot wings.

955
01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.188
- Give him the chips.
- Let's play!

956
01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:22.109
Whoo! I'm gonna get some of this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this?

957
01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.610
Five-hundred-dollar chips, sir.

958
01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.696
You gave me 500-dollar chips
because I'm black?

959
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:29.491
Uh, no, sir, I did not.
I just assumed that--

960
01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:31.201
Assumed a brother coming in here...

961
01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.871
...can only afford $500 a roll.
ls that it?

962
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.248
Uh, no, I didn't think that at all, sir.

963
01:04:36.415 --> 01:04:38.292
- You a racist?
-No, I'm not, sir.

964
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.586
How come everybody else got
thousand-dollar chips...

965
01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:42.421
...black man got a nickel?
-I don't know.

966
01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:43.672
How did that happen?

967
01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:45.132
- It just--
-It just happened.

968
01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:49.511
Ah, this is crazy. You think my people
suffered 362 years of slavery...

969
01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:52.764
...so you could send us back to the
cotton fields with 500-dollar chips?

970
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.641
- No.
-Do I look like Chicken George?

971
01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:55.893
- You do not.
-What is that?

972
01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.103
Sir, I think you should calm down.

973
01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:00.355
You should go over there
and count something.

974
01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.858
- I want thousand-dollar chips!
- Give me a second.

975
01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:05.402
I just wanna be treated fairly.
ls that too much to ask?

976
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.778
- No.
-ls that too much to ask?

977
01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.780
- No.
- Who knows what going on?

978
01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.532
I got a problem on table 9.

979
01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:22.669
How come ain't no black people
performing? We ain't good enough?

980
01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.838
We got Lionel Richie
performing here tonight.

981
01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:27.007
Lionel ain't been black
since the Commodores, man.

982
01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:29.843
What about Peaches and Herb?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

983
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.219
Ike and Tina.

984
01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.722
They can get back together.
This is crazy.

985
01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.600
Why don't you calm down,
win some money and have fun?

986
01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:39.561
I ain't calming down!
I'm sick of you trying to calm me down!

987
01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.439
We got a problem. Go.

988
01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:00.832
I have a dream...

989
01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:04.252
...that white people
and black people...

990
01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.254
...and even Chinese people...

991
01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:09.424
...can gamble together
without getting different chips!

992
01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.766
Hold it, hold it.
In the spirit of brotherhood...

993
01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:21.395
...let's just play craps, man.
Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

994
01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:44.167
Oh, shit.

995
01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:25.042
Hey.

996
01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.171
Get him!

997
01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:31.131
Stop!

998
01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.434
- Winner, 6.
- Yes!

999
01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:26.353
Yes, yes, yes!

1000
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.356
I feel good.
Oh, who put their hand on my butt?

1001
01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:31.817
Do it again. Give me that, give me that.
How much I win?

1002
01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.819
Two hundred thousand, sir.

1003
01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:35.445
Two hundred thousand dollars?

1004
01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.657
- Yeah! Whoo!
- All right.

1005
01:08:38.824 --> 01:08:41.076
- Corning out.
- This seven I'm about to roll...

1006
01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:44.579
...is for the 27 years Mandela spent
in that prison, couldn't get no justice...

1007
01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:46.915
...and took all that crap.
I ain't gonna crap out.

1008
01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.166
No!

1009
01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.460
This one is for Mandela!

1010
01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:53.964
A winner, seven.

1011
01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:56.007
- Free at last.
- Free at last.

1012
01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:57.342
Free at last.

1013
01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:58.927
Free at last.

1014
01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.442
Out.

1015
01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.739
Imagine a business...

1016
01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.534
...where people hand you money...

1017
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:27.581
...and you hand them back
absolutely nothing.

1018
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:32.794
Now, that's the real American dream.

1019
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.671
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...

1020
01:09:34.838 --> 01:09:38.925
...and a most
beautiful U.S. customs agent...

1021
01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:41.511
...I’m back in business.

1022
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.311
Look at you, Lee.

1023
01:09:49.644 --> 01:09:51.438
You look ridiculous.

1024
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.527
You know
it didn't have to be like this.

1025
01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.905
It's too bad.

1026
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.824
Like father, like son.

1027
01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:11.583
Look at this old fool.

1028
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.296
What does he think he's doing?

1029
01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:19.216
I tell you, it's almost impossible
to find a partner...

1030
01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:23.303
...that is trustworthy and loyal.
Don't you agree, Lee?

1031
01:10:25.764 --> 01:10:27.766
Everything stays on the table.

1032
01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.267
Don't nobody touch that table.

1033
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.518
All right.

1034
01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.314
Winner, four high, four high.

1035
01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:36.900
Yes! Yes!

1036
01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.820
Oh, my goodness! That's $500,000!

1037
01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:43.240
- Yes! That's $500,000!
- Come on, sir.

1038
01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:51.498
- Cash me out.
-You're gonna have to get off the table.

1039
01:10:51.665 --> 01:10:53.500
Thank you very much.

1040
01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:00.382
The trouble with partners is they die.

1041
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.893
Have fun.

1042
01:11:27.534 --> 01:11:29.286
Don't move! U.S. Secret Service!

1043
01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.037
You're under arrest.

1044
01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:50.098
These gentlemen will escort you
to the cashier.

1045
01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:53.810
Good. I don't wanna get jumped by
any of these rich white folks. Let's go.

1046
01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.128
I appreciate this, fellas.
You never can be too safe.

1047
01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.600
What the--?

1048
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.685
I'm sorry, man. Did that hurt?

1049
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.103
-Hey! you! Hold it!
-Ah!

1050
01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.023
- Hey. You okay?
- You all right?

1051
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.461
Black man on a roll, y'all start tripping.

1052
01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:03.505
- Y'all get back!
- Just calm down!

1053
01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:08.343
I said back!
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1054
01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:14.391
- Ow!
- Hey, stop! Get down!

1055
01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:16.184
Easy. Drop the stick.

1056
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.644
Lee! Aah!

1057
01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:24.776
Where you been, Lee?
I've been on a roll, man!

1058
01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:37.747
What happened to you, man?

1059
01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:41.334
What's that light?

1060
01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:45.171
Aw, man, this can't be good.

1061
01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.938
Move!
Would you get out of my way?

1062
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.327
What's wrong with you?

1063
01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.246
What happened to you, man?

1064
01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.336
Damn!

1065
01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:44.647
Why didn't tell me
you had a bomb in your mouth?

1066
01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.065
- I did!
-No, you didn't!

1067
01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.942
- I said "mm"!
-What the hell is "mm"?

1068
01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:49.194
Mm, boom!

1069
01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:56.075
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse.

1070
01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.911
Ricky Tan dead.

1071
01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.913
What you talking about? Whoa!

1072
01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:02.665
Ah!

1073
01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:09.380
Lee. Go after Ricky, man. I got this.

1074
01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:12.342
- Carter--
-Just go, man. I got this.

1075
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:19.307
I'm not gonna hold back this time
just because you're a woman.

1076
01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.100
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.

1077
01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.688
A very beautiful man
with a perfect body...

1078
01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.440
...who I'd like to take to the movies.

1079
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.360
Whoo!

1080
01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:33.863
Oh.

1081
01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.744
You don't know nothing about this?
Egyptian style, girl.

1082
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.331
You want some of this? Come on.

1083
01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:44.874
Whoo, ah! Bring it on!

1084
01:15:56.427 --> 01:15:58.096
- Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1085
01:15:58.263 --> 01:15:59.347
You need help.

1086
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.352
I didn't know which side you were on.

1087
01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.647
Well, now you know.

1088
01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:09.857
What's wrong with you, woman?

1089
01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:16.906
Mm, you smell good.

1090
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.741
Aah!

1091
01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:52.483
Aah!

1092
01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:16.841
Thank you, Benjamin. Thank you.

1093
01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:22.555
We could have been a good couple.

1094
01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.891
We could have had something special.

1095
01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:28.227
But you one crazy-ass bitch!

1096
01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:42.033
Americans love to gamble,
don't they, Mr. Reign?

1097
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.243
I never gamble.

1098
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.663
Oh, I'm, uh, cutting our deal short.

1099
01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.331
Oh.

1100
01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:53.294
- And my plates?
-The plates stay with me.

1101
01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:56.464
I'm sure
you won't have a problem with that.

1102
01:17:57.632 --> 01:18:02.470
I enjoyed that little story you told
about the dragon and the treasure.

1103
01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:05.181
My mother used to tell it to me
all the time.

1104
01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:09.352
Do you know the moral of that story?

1105
01:18:09.519 --> 01:18:11.813
Greed will imprison us all.

1106
01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.653
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

1107
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.585
Just like your father.

1108
01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.756
I really did try to help him, you know.

1109
01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.925
To share with him.

1110
01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:43.177
To make your life better.

1111
01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:46.013
But he was too weak.

1112
01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.349
Too afraid of change.

1113
01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:51.519
Give me the plates. It's over.

1114
01:18:51.686 --> 01:18:53.563
I don't think it's over.

1115
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:57.066
There are casinos all over this country.

1116
01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:00.528
I can make you a very rich man, Lee.

1117
01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:02.822
Don't make the same mistake
your father did.

1118
01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:07.160
If you reach for that gun, I'll kill you.

1119
01:19:07.702 --> 01:19:10.913
Don't you remember?
I'm already dead.

1120
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.296
Hey, Ricky. How you doing?

1121
01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:22.800
I see you got everything under control.
I'm gonna go downstairs-- Goddamn!

1122
01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:24.761
What happened to Reign?

1123
01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.555
Would you like me to tell you
how your father died?

1124
01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:30.349
Hey, hey. Wait one second, Lee.

1125
01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.477
It ain't worth it, man.
He trying to trick you.

1126
01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:33.728
Don't go too far, now.

1127
01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:36.063
He never begged for his life
or tried to make a deal.

1128
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.440
Put the gun down.

1129
01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:39.192
All he asked me...

1130
01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:41.277
"just seconds
before I pulled the trigger...

1131
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:44.155
...was that I promise not to kill you.

1132
01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:47.492
Oh, it was so pathetic.

1133
01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:51.245
Oh, hell, no. He don't went too far.
Shoot his ass now, Lee. Shoot his ass!

1134
01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:52.580
What are you gonna do, Lee?

1135
01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:55.291
All you gotta do is pull that trigger back
and barn!

1136
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.419
Are you going to spend the rest
of your life hiding like your father?

1137
01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:00.755
Don't let him talk about your daddy
like that. Shoot!

1138
01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:02.381
You can't do it, can you?

1139
01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:04.592
Yes, hell, you can.
Ain't nobody up here but us.

1140
01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:06.344
- Go off on him.
-Just as I thought.

1141
01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:08.095
He trying to punk you. Shoot him!

1142
01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.640
- Come on!
-If you ain't, kung fu his ass!

1143
01:20:10.807 --> 01:20:12.433
- Carter!
-Ah!

1144
01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.899
No!

1145
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.205
Damn!

1146
01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:36.123
Good kick, Lee.

1147
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.167
It was an accident.

1148
01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.253
That's okay.
We'll say he tried to catch a cab.

1149
01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:47.343
What's that in your--? Aw, hell, no.

1150
01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:51.055
Lady, listen to me.
Put that bomb down and turn it off!

1151
01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:53.850
- Carter, we have to jump!
-You crazy, man. I ain’t jumping.

1152
01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:58.020
- Use your jacket!
-Hey, turn that bomb off! Aah!

1153
01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:00.106
Crazy-ass--!

1154
01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:16.706
That wasn't so bad.

1155
01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:58.122
I cannot believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit.

1156
01:22:09.342 --> 01:22:11.177
Detective Lee, I hate to admit it...

1157
01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:14.722
...but the United States Secret Service
is indebted to you.

1158
01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:17.141
- Thank you.
-Thank you.

1159
01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:19.560
<i>- I’ll</i> see you onboard.
Mm-hm.

1160
01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:24.148
I wanna thank you too.

1161
01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:34.951
It was nice working with you.

1162
01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.963
I saw that.

1163
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.384
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1164
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.302
Ah, you played it cool too.

1165
01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.262
Walking away, not looking back.
I like that.

1166
01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:57.223
Yeah. I'm a player.

1167
01:22:58.933 --> 01:23:01.727
- Where is she headed?
-She's going to New York.

1168
01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:03.896
Mm.

1169
01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:07.274
- Is that your gate down there?
-Yep.

1170
01:23:07.942 --> 01:23:09.860
Well, I'm this way.

1171
01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:12.947
- Guess that mean goodbye.
-I guess so.

1172
01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:16.033
Thank you, Carter.

1173
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.452
Take good care of yourself, Lee.

1174
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.209
- Oh, Carter.
-Yeah, Lee?

1175
01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:26.877
What's up?

1176
01:23:28.421 --> 01:23:31.257
There is something
I want you to have.

1177
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.886
No, man. This is your daddy's badge.
I can't take that, man.

1178
01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:38.514
It's okay. No. Finally, I can let it go.

1179
01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:42.476
Thank you, man.

1180
01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:45.813
Hey, you know what?
I got something for you too.

1181
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.315
What is this?

1182
01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:49.859
That's $10,000, man.

1183
01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:52.528
Got it at the tables this morning
at Caesars. I'm still hot.

1184
01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:55.614
- I can't take this.
-Don't worry about it. I got a lot more.

1185
01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:57.408
- No, no, no.
-Go ahead. Enjoy yourself.

1186
01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:58.826
No, Carter. I can't have this.

1187
01:23:58.993 --> 01:24:01.996
Would you stop acting like a cop
for one second, man, and live it up?

1188
01:24:02.163 --> 01:24:04.457
There gotta be something you want.
Come on.

1189
01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.125
Think about it.

1190
01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:08.544
Final boarding call for flight</i> 44...

1191
01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.672
<i>...to New York City's LaGuardia.
All ticketed passengers should now...</i>

1192
01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:14.383
I always wanted to go
to Madison Square Garden...

1193
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:15.676
