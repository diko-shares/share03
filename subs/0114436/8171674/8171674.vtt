1
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.575
Hop in, pard.

2
00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:18.617
Where you going?

3
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.865
Vegas.

4
00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:22.282
Come on.

5
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.158
This is your lucky day.

6
00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:44.784
You can sit a little
bit closer if you want.

7
00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:47.822
It was a bad idea.

8
00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:48.947
Chill, OK?

9
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:50.406
I'm chilled.

10
00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.114
I sure am glad you're going
to be such good company.

11
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.614
Jesus saves!

12
00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:57.615
I don't like Garth Brooks.

13
00:01:57.697 --> 00:01:58.906
Me neither.

14
00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:01.905
I don't know anybody
that likes him.

15
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.905
You going to keep that thing
open all the way to Vegas?

16
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.529
You got a name?

17
00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:17.030
Look, I'll just
pull over. You can get out, OK?

18
00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.862
I've been driving
all the way from Kansas.

19
00:02:18.943 --> 00:02:23.656
I ain't in the mood to get myself
pickle-stuck for doing somebody a favour.

20
00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:24.902
OK?

21
00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:26.444
I'll just pull on over.

22
00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.903
All right?

23
00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:43.071
So you got a name?

24
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.652
I'm Jeff.

25
00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:47.818
Nomi.

26
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.277
What kind of name's that?

27
00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.068
My mom was Italian.

28
00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.734
Italian, huh?

29
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.443
You one of those Mafia girls?

30
00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.693
That why you got your blade?

31
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.234
What are you going to Vegas for,
you going to win?

32
00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.067
I'm going to dance.

33
00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:10.235
You going to be one of them
private escort dancers?

34
00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:11.939
OK, OK, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:13.357
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.067
KBID, you never go to sleep in Vegas.

37
00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:24.897
There she is.

38
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.606
You been here before?

39
00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:28.230
Sure. I got an uncle,

40
00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.359
he's a host at the Riviera.

41
00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:33.148
You gamble?

42
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.272
No.

43
00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:37.650
You got to gamble
if you're going to win.

44
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:39.647
I'm going to win.

45
00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.939
Then use some of that Mafia
money you got in the suitcase.

46
00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.811
Just leave your stuff in the car.

47
00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:08.144
I'll talk to my uncle,

48
00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:10.561
see if he can help you get a job.

49
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.353
What, ain't anyone
ever been nice to you?

50
00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:25.809
Want to play a slot machine?

51
00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:26.976
Yeah.

52
00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:28.976
Here's 10 bucks.

53
00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.933
You win, we split it up.

54
00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:33.726
No holding out on me either.

55
00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.935
I'm going to go see my uncle.

56
00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.725
Meet you right back here.

57
00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:56.348
Holy shit!

58
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:08.221
Look at you.

59
00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.475
Want to try some silver dollars?

60
00:05:10.556 --> 00:05:11.765
Sure.

61
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.056
Fuck!

62
00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:25.139
You lose all your money, honey?

63
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:26.972
You want to make some more?

64
00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.015
It won't take you
any longer than 15 minutes.

65
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.139
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to sell it.

66
00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:41.761
Fuck!

67
00:05:50.844 --> 00:05:52.053
Shit.

68
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:54.178
Fuck.

69
00:05:54.885 --> 00:05:55.968
Fuck!

70
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:57.176
Fuck the fucker!

71
00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.384
Fuck!

72
00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:01.553
That's my car!

73
00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:03.302
I want my fucking suitcase!

74
00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.011
Get off my car!

75
00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:11.384
Jesus.

76
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.927
Hey... Leave me alone!

77
00:06:45.714 --> 00:06:46.839
So...

78
00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:48.921
What was in your suitcase?

79
00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:51.382
Nothing. Just my stuff.

80
00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.215
Everything I had.

81
00:06:54.504 --> 00:06:55.588
Fuck!

82
00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.715
I just got here.

83
00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.714
Welcome to Vegas.

84
00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.046
You know anybody here?

85
00:07:12.628 --> 00:07:14.712
Got any family you can call?

86
00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:17.712
I don't have any family.

87
00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:21.629
Where are you from?

88
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.294
Back east.

89
00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.171
From where back east?

90
00:07:28.418 --> 00:07:30.044
Different places.

91
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.709
Look,

92
00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:44.919
you can stay with me
if you need a place to crash.

93
00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:46.753
It's not much.

94
00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:49.085
Until you get a job?

95
00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:56.210
Are you hitting on me?

96
00:07:57.875 --> 00:07:58.875
No.

97
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:03.501
You're not a hooker, are you?

98
00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:09.463
No.

99
00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:15.124
Andrew Carver, another smash,

100
00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:16.875
Walk into the Wind.

101
00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.917
Should we walk into the wind

102
00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:25.166
Check it out!

103
00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.040
They're great.

104
00:08:29.123 --> 00:08:30.457
They're neat, huh?

105
00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.040
They're neat.

106
00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.122
Want to come with me?

107
00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:36.122
We've got this new lead.

108
00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:37.873
She's really good.

109
00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:40.123
I got to go to work.

110
00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:42.123
Jerk, you don't have to be to work

111
00:08:42.205 --> 00:08:43.289
for three hours.

112
00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:45.832
What are you going to do,
watch TV and eat chips?

113
00:08:45.912 --> 00:08:47.038
Yeah.

114
00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:49.455
Where are the chips?

115
00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:50.997
I don't know.

116
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:52.954
You ate them, didn't you?

117
00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:54.163
Mmm-mmm. - Yes, you did.

118
00:08:54.245 --> 00:08:55.704
No, I didn't. - You did!

119
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.872
You did! - Stop.

120
00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:00.621
Oh, come on, Nomi.

121
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.162
You can show off your nails.

122
00:09:03.244 --> 00:09:05.245
They'll all be so jealous.

123
00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:07.286
You think?

124
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:08.577
I think.

125
00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:10.662
What am I going to wear?

126
00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:13.787
Wear the dress
that I made last week.

127
00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:14.869
The fringe one?

128
00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:17.160
I'll put my hair up.

129
00:09:17.242 --> 00:09:19.035
We don't have time.

130
00:09:19.201 --> 00:09:21.578
I'll hurry. I promise.

131
00:09:22.034 --> 00:09:24.160
All right, let's go.
Let's do this.

132
00:09:24.242 --> 00:09:26.160
Come on, you have two minutes.

133
00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:27.618
Robes off.

134
00:09:27.702 --> 00:09:29.161
Ladies, how are we doing?

135
00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:30.285
Annie. What?

136
00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:31.784
You're naked.

137
00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:32.908
What happened?

138
00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:34.285
It just ripped.

139
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:35.618
It's almost done.

140
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.160
Molly, they'll see a smiling snatch

141
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.532
if you don't fix this G-string.

142
00:09:39.618 --> 00:09:41.952
I'll be right there, Annie.

143
00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:43.868
She wants to smile her snatch.

144
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:46.242
She probably cut that string herself.

145
00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:47.675
You're terrible, Julie.
OK, you're done.

146
00:09:47.699 --> 00:09:49.366
Come on, guys, move it.

147
00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:50.448
What's that smell?

148
00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:53.366
That damn monkey act.
He feeds them garlic.

149
00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.656
It stinks.

150
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.574
Want me to go on stage without a G?

151
00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:59.617
I am fixing it right now.
Give me one damn minute.

152
00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:00.781
Jesus!

153
00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:02.616
Who wants to see her snatch anyway?

154
00:10:02.697 --> 00:10:04.698
I certainly wouldn't. - We know that.

155
00:10:04.864 --> 00:10:06.531
Nomi, come on.

156
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:09.131
All right, you guys, let's line it up.

157
00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:11.239
You got four counts of eight.

158
00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:12.780
Miss Connors.

159
00:10:12.863 --> 00:10:14.572
Just set them over there.

160
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:17.072
There! All right, let's move it!

161
00:10:17.154 --> 00:10:18.404
Molly, my G!

162
00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:19.573
Here.

163
00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:22.490
Wouldn't it be great if one of these
nights she fell down the stairs?

164
00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:24.489
Watch from the show room.

165
00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:25.614
Can I go up there?

166
00:10:25.696 --> 00:10:26.821
Sure.

167
00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:30.074
You got two counts of eight.
What are you doing?

168
00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:32.197
Brian, move your ass!

169
00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:07.443
Ladies and gentlemen,

170
00:11:07.526 --> 00:11:09.444
the Stardust proudly presents

171
00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:11.359
Miss Cristal Connors.

172
00:12:19.396 --> 00:12:22.356
We could've brought
anyone into this show.

173
00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:26.146
Latoya, Suzanne, you name it.

174
00:12:26.476 --> 00:12:28.144
We wanted Cristal.

175
00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:32.520
Cristal Connors defines
what Las Vegas is all about.

176
00:12:32.603 --> 00:12:34.937
She's dazzling, she's exciting,

177
00:12:35.018 --> 00:12:36.977
and she's very, very sexy.

178
00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:38.768
How does it feel to be back in Vegas?

179
00:12:38.852 --> 00:12:40.978
How did you feel about the show tonight?

180
00:12:41.058 --> 00:12:43.602
It's the best show I've ever been in.

181
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.517
I only hope I can do it justice.

182
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:47.393
You did, and you will.

183
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.727
We're thrilled to have you here.

184
00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:52.143
And I'm thrilled to be here.

185
00:12:52.224 --> 00:12:53.266
You, too, now.

186
00:12:53.349 --> 00:12:55.058
Mr. Karlman, can we have one of you

187
00:12:55.143 --> 00:12:57.352
handing Cristal the flowers?

188
00:12:57.726 --> 00:13:00.644
Zack.

189
00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:02.059
You do it.

190
00:13:02.517 --> 00:13:05.227
This is Zack Carey, entertainment
director of the Stardust Hotel.

191
00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:06.851
He's so smooth.

192
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:09.143
Your bouquet, Ms. Connors.

193
00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.851
Can I keep them?

194
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.852
That's it. Thank you for coming.

195
00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:16.308
That's all.

196
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.099
She's great, isn't she?

197
00:13:22.182 --> 00:13:23.349
She doesn't suck.

198
00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:25.391
Molly, we still need you.

199
00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:26.681
Come with me.

200
00:13:26.763 --> 00:13:29.056
You can be my assistant. Come on.

201
00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:37.347
Yes?

202
00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:41.014
Yes, Miss Connors.

203
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.513
Cristal. Please.

204
00:13:43.805 --> 00:13:45.431
And you are? - I'm sorry.

205
00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:46.763
Molly. Molly Abrams.

206
00:13:46.846 --> 00:13:48.513
Molly, this top is too tight.

207
00:13:48.597 --> 00:13:50.598
My breasts are getting crushed.

208
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:52.181
I can loosen it for you.

209
00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:54.014
OK. To about here.

210
00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:55.804
No, no, a little less.

211
00:13:55.887 --> 00:13:57.179
I want my nipples to press,

212
00:13:57.263 --> 00:14:00.432
but I don't want them
to look like they're levitating.

213
00:14:00.886 --> 00:14:02.596
OK. - Thanks, darlin'.

214
00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:04.178
You're welcome.

215
00:14:10.885 --> 00:14:13.512
You were really great tonight, Miss...

216
00:14:14.218 --> 00:14:15.468
Cristal.

217
00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:17.177
Thanks, darlin'.

218
00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:20.428
Andrew Carver sent you these?

219
00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:22.094
If that's what the card says,

220
00:14:22.176 --> 00:14:23.760
then that's who sent it.

221
00:14:23.843 --> 00:14:25.468
I just love him.

222
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.052
Oh. This is my friend Nomi.

223
00:14:28.134 --> 00:14:29.676
She's a dancer, too.

224
00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:30.758
Is she now?

225
00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:32.341
Yes, and she's really good.

226
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.676
Where do you dance at?

227
00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:36.134
Um...

228
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.884
At the Cheetah.

229
00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:41.593
I don't know how good you are, darlin',

230
00:14:41.675 --> 00:14:43.926
and I don't know
what it is you're good at,

231
00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.925
but if it's at the Cheetah,

232
00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:48.466
it's not dancing, I know that much.

233
00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:51.508
You don't know shit!

234
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.718
I'm, I'm really sorry, Miss Connors.

235
00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:58.008
Cristal.

236
00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:01.464
I told you.

237
00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:03.257
Cristal.

238
00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:06.090
Your friend has nice nails.

239
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:08.257
She does them herself.

240
00:15:09.048 --> 00:15:11.300
Maybe she can do mine sometime.

241
00:15:15.337 --> 00:15:17.338
Hey! Nomi!

242
00:15:18.837 --> 00:15:20.504
I work here, OK?

243
00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.088
I need my pay check.

244
00:15:23.754 --> 00:15:25.255
I do not want her to be pissed at me.

245
00:15:25.337 --> 00:15:26.671
I'm sorry!

246
00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:31.797
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:33.672
Jesus, Nomi.

248
00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.922
I'll drive you to work, OK?

249
00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:44.336
I'm not going.

250
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:46.046
They'll fire you.

251
00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:48.254
Fuck, I don't care.

252
00:15:48.336 --> 00:15:50.296
Yes, you do. - No, I don't.

253
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:54.837
OK.

254
00:15:55.169 --> 00:15:56.461
Let's go.

255
00:15:57.502 --> 00:15:58.669
Where?

256
00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:01.086
You know where.

257
00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.251
She can dance, can't she?

258
00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:31.209
She thinks she can.

259
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.751
I'm going to go dance with her.

260
00:16:36.832 --> 00:16:38.082
Man, you can't do that.

261
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.290
You're working.

262
00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.166
T.C.'s going to have your ass.

263
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.751
T.C.'s at the Riviera playing craps.

264
00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:46.790
You want to dance?

265
00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:47.956
I am dancing.

266
00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:50.416
But do you want to dance with me?

267
00:16:50.497 --> 00:16:51.706
You good?

268
00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:53.665
Yeah. I'm good.

269
00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:56.499
I'm going to have a drink.

270
00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.162
You can dance.

271
00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:20.705
I don't lie.

272
00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:22.412
You can't.

273
00:17:22.994 --> 00:17:24.828
Then what am I doing?

274
00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:27.912
Teasing my dick.

275
00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:30.454
You got potential. I could teach you.

276
00:17:30.536 --> 00:17:31.661
Yeah?

277
00:17:31.828 --> 00:17:32.953
Yeah.

278
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.369
I'm not teasing it now, am I?

279
00:17:40.451 --> 00:17:42.077
Watch it, buddy.

280
00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:43.535
Be cool. I'm a bouncer.

281
00:17:43.617 --> 00:17:45.493
You be cool, buddy.

282
00:17:59.033 --> 00:18:00.158
Nomi!

283
00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:02.825
Hey, you! Hey!

284
00:18:02.907 --> 00:18:04.157
Hold her!

285
00:18:04.325 --> 00:18:05.367
She started it.

286
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.450
Fuck you!

287
00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:08.326
Fuck you, asshole!

288
00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:12.324
Malone.

289
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:13.992
Yeah.

290
00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:15.825
You're out of here.

291
00:18:16.783 --> 00:18:18.284
Hey, your release papers.

292
00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:19.866
Yo, what's up?

293
00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:21.990
I bailed you out, girl.

294
00:18:22.074 --> 00:18:24.784
Don't that even
give me a cup of coffee?

295
00:18:25.657 --> 00:18:27.908
All I did was tell
you I'd teach you to dance.

296
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.241
I don't need nobody
to teach me to dance.

297
00:18:30.323 --> 00:18:31.603
That's because you're a bad-ass.

298
00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:32.857
You got your arm straight out,

299
00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:34.323
saying, "Back off, motherfucker."

300
00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:37.031
Yeah, you got that down.
Back off, motherfucker!

301
00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:42.488
Whoo! You know what?

302
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:44.697
My head hurts, my dick hurts,

303
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.282
and you got me fired
from my fucking job.

304
00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:48.862
Shit happens, you know?

305
00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:52.448
That's it?
That's what I get, fucking wisdom?

306
00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:53.571
That's it?

307
00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:54.861
Yeah, that's it.

308
00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:56.237
You get wisdom.

309
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.573
You're not just a pain in my
head and a pain in my dick.

310
00:18:59.654 --> 00:19:01.154
You're also a pain in my ass.

311
00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:02.529
Life sucks, you know?

312
00:19:02.612 --> 00:19:04.488
"Life sucks"? "Shit happens"?

313
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:06.613
You get this stuff off of T-shirts?

314
00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:11.736
I just want a cup of coffee.

315
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.153
Yeah? - Yeah.

316
00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:16.695
You got a quarter?

317
00:19:16.777 --> 00:19:18.152
Sure. Here.

318
00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:20.986
Buy yourself a cup.

319
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.694
Al is pissed.

320
00:19:24.776 --> 00:19:27.278
He says if you miss another night...

321
00:19:27.693 --> 00:19:28.818
How did you get out?

322
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.776
Him. He bailed me out.

323
00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:32.277
How come?

324
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.775
I kicked him in the nuts.

325
00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:35.235
He liked it?

326
00:19:35.317 --> 00:19:36.651
He must've.

327
00:19:36.817 --> 00:19:37.900
Nomi.

328
00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:45.026
Nomi, do my boobs
look any bigger to you?

329
00:19:45.482 --> 00:19:48.359
Shit. Carmi thinks
she's pregnant again.

330
00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:50.986
Girl, you missed your period again?

331
00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:52.109
I don't know.

332
00:19:52.148 --> 00:19:53.774
I don't think so.

333
00:19:53.856 --> 00:19:56.775
It's like a Japanese convention out there.

334
00:19:56.983 --> 00:19:58.483
Hey, mama!

335
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:02.567
Maybe you better get your little
weenie jokes cranked up there.

336
00:20:02.649 --> 00:20:04.066
This thing isn't working again.

337
00:20:04.148 --> 00:20:05.357
Come on, baby.

338
00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:07.190
Come on, here we go.

339
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.899
One more time. Harder. Harder.

340
00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:11.315
Yeah! Yeah!

341
00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:13.147
Let me try it.

342
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.689
Yeah! Yeah!

343
00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:20.981
I want you to meet Hope.

344
00:20:21.063 --> 00:20:22.223
Hi. Hello, Hope. Hello, Hope.

345
00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:23.312
OK, cut it out.

346
00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:25.773
This is Tiffany,

347
00:20:25.853 --> 00:20:27.521
Farrah, Heather,

348
00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:28.812
Henrietta.

349
00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.689
My name isn't Hope. My name's Penny.

350
00:20:35.812 --> 00:20:37.312
They want class, dumb-dumb.

351
00:20:37.395 --> 00:20:38.979
They don't want to fuck a Penny.

352
00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:42.315
They want to fuck a Heather or a Tiffany.

353
00:20:43.145 --> 00:20:44.688
Or a Hope, huh?

354
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.229
This is a class joint.

355
00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.771
You got that?

356
00:20:49.229 --> 00:20:51.438
Gentlemen and those few ladies out there,

357
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.688
what you've all been waiting for,

358
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.020
Henrietta,

359
00:20:55.103 --> 00:20:57.854
Queen of Bazooms!

360
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:14.685
Pull your dress up.

361
00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.726
You couldn't handle me

362
00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:19.101
with all these wrinkles of fat.

363
00:21:20.016 --> 00:21:22.810
Why, you'd never even find the thing.

364
00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:27.810
I'd have to piss on you
to give you a clue.

365
00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:32.600
You need more pink.

366
00:21:33.015 --> 00:21:34.641
Thanks, Heather.

367
00:21:36.349 --> 00:21:38.976
Have you ever done a lap dance before?

368
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:40.140
No.

369
00:21:40.974 --> 00:21:42.975
Got to talk them into it, OK?

370
00:21:43.057 --> 00:21:45.267
50 bucks a pop,
you take them in the back.

371
00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:47.683
Touch and go. They touch, they go.

372
00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:50.975
You can touch them.
They cannot touch you.

373
00:21:51.598 --> 00:21:52.890
Oh, that's good.

374
00:21:52.973 --> 00:21:54.848
If they come, it's OK.

375
00:21:55.098 --> 00:21:57.474
If they take it out, come all
over you, call the bouncer.

376
00:21:57.556 --> 00:21:59.139
Unless he gives you a big tip.

377
00:21:59.222 --> 00:22:00.597
If he gives you a big tip,

378
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.972
it's OK.

379
00:22:03.137 --> 00:22:04.638
You got that?

380
00:22:05.638 --> 00:22:06.680
OK.

381
00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:11.220
And you.

382
00:22:11.304 --> 00:22:13.764
Where the fuck were you last night?

383
00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:16.721
I was having my period, Al.

384
00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:19.929
You don't want blood all over the place.

385
00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:22.263
Do you?

386
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.472
I'm getting real tired
of your shit, kid.

387
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.638
If you want to last longer than a week,

388
00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:30.720
you'll give me a blow job.

389
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.012
First I get you used to the money,

390
00:22:34.094 --> 00:22:36.053
then I make you swallow.

391
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:40.554
Was he serious?

392
00:22:48.592 --> 00:22:49.968
Here we are.

393
00:22:55.592 --> 00:22:57.677
Oh, look, baby, you missed a spot.

394
00:22:57.925 --> 00:22:58.967
Thank you.

395
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:03.927
The farmer in the dell

396
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.967
I had a cherry once

397
00:23:06.048 --> 00:23:09.551
And now it's shot to hell

398
00:23:09.632 --> 00:23:11.216
Hey. Get off the stage!

399
00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:13.216
Get off the stage!

400
00:23:13.298 --> 00:23:17.301
You better shut your hole,
honey! Mine's making money.

401
00:23:17.383 --> 00:23:19.926
You know what they call that useless

402
00:23:20.007 --> 00:23:22.384
piece of skin around a twat?

403
00:23:22.716 --> 00:23:23.925
What? - What?

404
00:23:24.008 --> 00:23:26.093
A woman!

405
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:34.466
Ladies and gentlemen,

406
00:23:34.547 --> 00:23:36.714
the girl to tickle your pickle,

407
00:23:36.798 --> 00:23:38.215
Heather!

408
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:49.296
Yeah.

409
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:00.713
Take off your clothes

410
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:28.629
Can I see it, baby?

411
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:32.585
I got a good shot

412
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:35.002
Put your Leg on the chair

413
00:24:40.626 --> 00:24:43.670
You know you're too hot
when you play with your hair

414
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.251
I like it

415
00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:48.583
I just want to holler,
scream, and shout

416
00:24:48.666 --> 00:24:52.252
When you Let your fingers
do the walking

417
00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:12.708
Phil, what'd he say?

418
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:15.916
He says in America,
everyone's a gynecologist.

419
00:25:21.205 --> 00:25:22.664
You like her?

420
00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.830
I like you.

421
00:25:25.954 --> 00:25:27.746
I'll buy her for you.

422
00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:43.329
What the hell are you doing?
We got spenders out there.

423
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:44.828
Put your nightie on.

424
00:25:44.912 --> 00:25:47.288
Tell him to go fuck himself.

425
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.622
I'll kick your ass out of here.

426
00:25:54.161 --> 00:25:56.371
Tell him. - Do yourself a favour.

427
00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.162
OK,

428
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.286
I'll put my nightie on.

429
00:26:28.659 --> 00:26:30.618
Hi. My name's Heather.

430
00:26:49.616 --> 00:26:51.283
Want a drink?

431
00:26:51.406 --> 00:26:52.782
Hi, I'm Heather.

432
00:26:52.864 --> 00:26:55.824
Would you like a private dance with me?

433
00:26:56.113 --> 00:26:58.156
Could I suck your tits?

434
00:26:58.239 --> 00:27:00.573
You can't touch me,
but I can touch you.

435
00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:01.989
I'd love to touch you.

436
00:27:02.073 --> 00:27:04.282
I know where you can touch me.

437
00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:05.947
Heather.

438
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:15.863
What's going on?

439
00:27:16.696 --> 00:27:19.156
They want a private dance with her.

440
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.738
So? Great, get over there.

441
00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:27.237
Hi. My name is Heather.

442
00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:28.486
Hey, Nomi.

443
00:27:28.569 --> 00:27:30.237
I love your nails.

444
00:27:30.652 --> 00:27:33.612
We'd like you to private
dance with both of us.

445
00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:36.447
We don't do that.
One at a time, no women.

446
00:27:37.236 --> 00:27:38.319
$100.

447
00:27:39.444 --> 00:27:41.612
Sorry. That's the rules.

448
00:27:43.068 --> 00:27:45.903
200. You just do Zack, and I'll watch.

449
00:27:50.442 --> 00:27:51.526
500.

450
00:27:53.234 --> 00:27:54.317
Done.

451
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.067
I said done.

452
00:28:26.066 --> 00:28:27.083
You guys just sit over there,

453
00:28:27.107 --> 00:28:29.108
and I'll change the music.

454
00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:32.649
What's this about, Cris?

455
00:28:32.732 --> 00:28:33.857
It's about fun.

456
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:37.148
You sit there,

457
00:28:38.106 --> 00:28:39.774
and I'll sit here.

458
00:29:08.436 --> 00:29:09.937
She's got to work it

459
00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:12.812
For the pleasure of the people

460
00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:14.812
She's got to work it

461
00:29:14.893 --> 00:29:17.770
For the pleasure of the people

462
00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:19.770
She's got to work it

463
00:29:19.854 --> 00:29:22.981
For the pleasure of the people

464
00:29:23.727 --> 00:29:27.021
She'll only get lost in your mind

465
00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:39.352
She's got to work it

466
00:29:39.434 --> 00:29:42.520
For the pleasure of the people

467
00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:46.685
She'll only get lost in your mind

468
00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:51.852
Sex kitty dances to
the heartbeat of a dreamer

469
00:29:52.933 --> 00:29:54.016
Watch out

470
00:29:54.098 --> 00:29:56.808
You're just wasting your time

471
00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:01.184
What are you doing here, man?

472
00:30:01.264 --> 00:30:02.348
Nothing.

473
00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:04.390
You want it, you pay for it.

474
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.549
Thank you.

475
00:31:44.257 --> 00:31:45.299
500.

476
00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:04.465
That was fun, wasn't it?

477
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:06.299
You're such a bitch.

478
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.298
Oh, but you love me.

479
00:32:08.379 --> 00:32:09.505
Can you walk?

480
00:32:09.589 --> 00:32:10.797
Yeah.

481
00:32:13.005 --> 00:32:14.005
Good night, girls.

482
00:32:14.088 --> 00:32:15.130
Good night. - Good night.

483
00:32:15.213 --> 00:32:16.713
Get some rest.

484
00:32:21.712 --> 00:32:23.421
Go out and celebrate.

485
00:32:23.504 --> 00:32:25.505
We can go to my place
and smoke some dope.

486
00:32:25.587 --> 00:32:28.339
You still got some
of the Thai stuff?

487
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.963
I love thighs. I almost
get off on thighs.

488
00:32:31.044 --> 00:32:32.336
I like armpits, too.

489
00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:33.419
You want to come, Nomi?

490
00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:34.711
Not me.

491
00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:35.960
I'll come.

492
00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:39.087
Hey, you just got 500 off a lap dance.

493
00:32:39.793 --> 00:32:41.294
Al, just stop.

494
00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.545
You act like somebody died.

495
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:03.002
Hey. Wait a minute. Listen.

496
00:33:03.958 --> 00:33:05.375
Just listen.

497
00:33:07.583 --> 00:33:09.250
You got more
natural talent when you dance

498
00:33:09.334 --> 00:33:11.418
than anybody I've ever seen.

499
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.542
I've seen a lot of dancers.

500
00:33:14.624 --> 00:33:17.125
I studied in New York, Alvin Ailey.

501
00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:20.790
You burn when you dance.

502
00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.166
Yeah, you said I couldn't.

503
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:25.582
You got to hold some of it in.

504
00:33:25.664 --> 00:33:27.832
You got some shit to learn.
Dancin' ain't fuckin'.

505
00:33:27.915 --> 00:33:30.458
What's that, more wisdom? I know that.

506
00:33:30.581 --> 00:33:31.664
No, you don't.

507
00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:34.124
You dance like when
you fucked that guy last night.

508
00:33:34.206 --> 00:33:35.289
What guy?

509
00:33:35.373 --> 00:33:37.124
That guy with the chick.

510
00:33:37.207 --> 00:33:39.166
You took 'em in the back.

511
00:33:39.248 --> 00:33:40.332
I didn't fuck him.

512
00:33:40.414 --> 00:33:42.248
Yeah you did, you fucked him and her.

513
00:33:42.331 --> 00:33:43.831
Are you following me around?

514
00:33:43.915 --> 00:33:45.332
I didn't fuck anybody.

515
00:33:45.415 --> 00:33:46.749
I saw you!

516
00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:49.665
Man, everybody got AIDS and shit.

517
00:33:49.747 --> 00:33:52.081
Y'know, what is it that you think you do?

518
00:33:52.164 --> 00:33:54.582
You fuck 'em without fucking 'em,
that's what you do.

519
00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:56.331
Well, it ain't right.

520
00:33:56.412 --> 00:33:58.580
You got too much talent for that
to be right.

521
00:33:58.663 --> 00:34:00.247
Get out of here!

522
00:34:00.914 --> 00:34:03.248
Bitch, I'm tellin' you the truth.

523
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.288
You want me to go, I'm outta here.

524
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:15.288
Boo! I got an "A."

525
00:34:18.952 --> 00:34:21.704
Four more classes and they're
gonna have to give me that degree.

526
00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:22.827
Great.

527
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:26.245
Oh my god,
I haven't gotten laid in six months.

528
00:34:26.745 --> 00:34:27.912
My right hand is so tired,

529
00:34:27.994 --> 00:34:29.137
I can barely thread a needle.

530
00:34:29.161 --> 00:34:30.620
Use the left one.

531
00:34:30.702 --> 00:34:31.702
For threading a needle?

532
00:34:31.785 --> 00:34:32.911
Yeah.

533
00:34:40.783 --> 00:34:42.201
I like that.

534
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.993
I can make that.

535
00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.701
Yeah?

536
00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:48.244
Yeah. Let's go to the fabric store.

537
00:34:50.533 --> 00:34:53.076
I wanna buy it. I've got the money.

538
00:34:53.908 --> 00:34:54.949
Why?

539
00:34:56.074 --> 00:34:57.992
I don't know. I just do.

540
00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:03.493
I never had a dress like that.

541
00:35:05.532 --> 00:35:07.533
It'll look great on me.

542
00:35:11.072 --> 00:35:12.364
Won't it?

543
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.406
Yeah.

544
00:35:18.072 --> 00:35:19.656
Ooh, what do you think?

545
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.491
Oh, my goodness.

546
00:35:24.281 --> 00:35:26.032
It looks quite good on you.

547
00:35:26.114 --> 00:35:27.740
It doesn't suck.

548
00:35:30.654 --> 00:35:32.739
I can't believe I bought it.

549
00:35:32.822 --> 00:35:35.115
We'll celebrate. I'll buy you a burrito.

550
00:35:35.196 --> 00:35:38.156
I'll even buy you some fajitas.

551
00:35:38.238 --> 00:35:39.614
Oh, fajitas.

552
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.197
Fuck, I can't. I'm on early.

553
00:35:43.653 --> 00:35:44.904
Al's on my back.

554
00:35:44.986 --> 00:35:46.862
Don't worry. I'll drive you.

555
00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:48.030
OK.

556
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.695
Oh my God!

557
00:35:52.028 --> 00:35:53.278
He's coming here!

558
00:35:53.361 --> 00:35:54.403
Maybe you can meet him.

559
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:56.153
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

560
00:35:56.235 --> 00:35:59.779
You say, "Andrew, I can't
even thread a needle anymore."

561
00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:03.028
Baby, mama's waitin' for you.
Come to me.

562
00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.194
Stop!

563
00:36:04.277 --> 00:36:05.986
I gotta get tickets to the concert.

564
00:36:43.733 --> 00:36:45.025
Hey, come on.
- Hey baby, give it to me.

565
00:36:45.107 --> 00:36:46.608
Excuse me. - Come on, baby.

566
00:36:47.647 --> 00:36:48.647
Hey... Fuck off!

567
00:36:48.731 --> 00:36:49.981
Whoa. Sorry.

568
00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:51.566
Remember me?

569
00:36:51.649 --> 00:36:53.775
Phil Newkirk, Stardust Hotel.

570
00:36:55.064 --> 00:36:58.275
Uh-huh. - Listen, there's a
spot open in the chorus line.

571
00:36:58.565 --> 00:37:00.316
We're auditioning tomorrow morning.

572
00:37:00.397 --> 00:37:02.440
I think you should try out.

573
00:37:02.522 --> 00:37:03.522
Me?

574
00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:05.106
Yeah, you.

575
00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:06.983
You came here to ask me?

576
00:37:07.064 --> 00:37:09.941
When I saw you dance, I thought, "Yes."

577
00:37:13.396 --> 00:37:15.147
She sent you, didn't she?

578
00:37:15.229 --> 00:37:16.980
No, nobody sent me.

579
00:37:17.854 --> 00:37:19.688
Be there at 10:00.

580
00:37:12.896 --> 00:37:24.813
Ba-um! Ba-um! Ba-um!
The Queen of Bazooms,

581
00:37:24.896 --> 00:37:27.314
Henrietta!

582
00:37:27.395 --> 00:37:29.313
I wanna see your ass.

583
00:37:30.395 --> 00:37:32.771
Oh, show me a home

584
00:37:32.853 --> 00:37:35.229
Where the buffalo roam

585
00:37:35.312 --> 00:37:38.647
And I'll show you a home

586
00:37:38.727 --> 00:37:40.352
Full o' shit

587
00:37:41.894 --> 00:37:43.686
Thank you. Good night.

588
00:37:47.018 --> 00:37:49.895
Molly! Molly!

589
00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:52.352
What? What is it?

590
00:37:52.434 --> 00:37:56.770
I got...I got an audition.

591
00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:07.851
Hey, Pollyanna.

592
00:38:07.933 --> 00:38:09.058
What did you call me?

593
00:38:09.143 --> 00:38:11.478
I said you looked like Pollyanna.

594
00:38:11.558 --> 00:38:13.058
OK, ladies,

595
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.391
I'm Tony Moss.

596
00:38:15.975 --> 00:38:17.726
I produce this show.

597
00:38:18.307 --> 00:38:21.142
Some of you probably
heard that I'm a prick.

598
00:38:21.223 --> 00:38:22.724
I am a prick.

599
00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:25.852
I got one interest here,
and that's the show.

600
00:38:26.557 --> 00:38:28.433
I don't care whether you live or die.

601
00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:31.224
I wanna see you dance and
I wanna see you dance smile.

602
00:38:31.723 --> 00:38:33.474
I can't use you if you can't smile,

603
00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:35.306
I can't use you if you can't show,

604
00:38:35.388 --> 00:38:38.724
I can't use you if you can't sell.
Let me take a look at you.

605
00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:42.892
Spread out. Spread out.

606
00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:44.472
Jesus Christ!

607
00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:46.556
Marty, take a look at these tits.

608
00:38:46.848 --> 00:38:48.474
What are these, watermelons?

609
00:38:48.556 --> 00:38:50.765
This is a stage, babe, it's not a patch.

610
00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:52.305
See ya.

611
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.140
I've seen you before.

612
00:38:55.222 --> 00:38:57.849
Yes, Mr. Moss,
I auditioned for you in January.

613
00:38:57.929 --> 00:39:00.139
You told me to get my nose fixed.

614
00:39:00.222 --> 00:39:01.222
Nose looks good.

615
00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:02.305
Thank you, Mr. Moss.

616
00:39:02.388 --> 00:39:03.472
Nice smile, too.

617
00:39:03.555 --> 00:39:04.555
Thank you, Mr. Moss.

618
00:39:04.595 --> 00:39:07.472
You know what though, your ears
are stickin' out. They are.

619
00:39:08.053 --> 00:39:10.346
Come back and see me
when you get 'em fixed.

620
00:39:10.429 --> 00:39:11.637
See ya.

621
00:39:13.054 --> 00:39:15.097
Can you spell
MGM backwards? I bet you can't.

622
00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:16.929
M-G-M. - I'm impressed.

623
00:39:17.677 --> 00:39:20.679
Come back when you've fucked
some of this baby fat off. See ya.

624
00:39:21.136 --> 00:39:23.053
I hope you got some
nice wigs, tennis ball.

625
00:39:23.136 --> 00:39:24.344
I do.

626
00:39:24.552 --> 00:39:26.219
What kind of classes have you had?

627
00:39:26.302 --> 00:39:27.635
Ice-skating classes, Mr. Moss,

628
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.220
ballet classes, technique classes,

629
00:39:29.303 --> 00:39:32.680
stretch classes, jazz classes,
jazz technique classes.

630
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:35.219
This show is called Goddess,
it ain't called Classes.

631
00:39:35.302 --> 00:39:36.510
See ya.

632
00:39:37.177 --> 00:39:39.303
What kind of classes have you had?

633
00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:40.634
I haven't had classes.

634
00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:42.261
Then what are you doing here?

635
00:39:42.344 --> 00:39:44.429
I'm watching you be a prick.

636
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:48.302
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

637
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:50.927
Gay, run them through the routine.

638
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.260
All right you guys, everyone
back up, find some space.

639
00:39:53.341 --> 00:39:54.381
Start with your right leg,

640
00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:58.344
slap it on, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

641
00:39:59.883 --> 00:40:01.925
Go! 5, 6, 7.

642
00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:03.216
Hit it!

643
00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:04.841
Bum-bah! Ho! Ho!

644
00:40:06.965 --> 00:40:08.674
Slam it! Bum-bah! Ho!

645
00:40:11.215 --> 00:40:12.299
Kick! Ha! Ha!

646
00:40:15.132 --> 00:40:16.883
Go! Go! Go!

647
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:18.465
And... Stay there!

648
00:40:18.548 --> 00:40:20.299
All right relax guys. 
You can take a break.

649
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:25.380
OK, tennis ball,
dark hair in the back...

650
00:40:25.464 --> 00:40:26.505
Hello, doll.

651
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:28.715
Hello. So how's it going?

652
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.547
Pretty good.

653
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.714
OK.

654
00:40:33.173 --> 00:40:34.882
I want you to stay.

655
00:40:36.754 --> 00:40:38.088
And...you.

656
00:40:40.463 --> 00:40:41.838
You, too.

657
00:40:41.922 --> 00:40:44.132
Goodbye, ladies,
you wasted my time and yours.

658
00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:46.380
The other three, line 'em up.

659
00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:52.212
OK, show me your tits.

660
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.005
I got a topless show, for
Chrissakes. Let me see your tits!

661
00:41:13.543 --> 00:41:14.877
Very nice.

662
00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:18.751
Very nice, ladies.

663
00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:21.334
Gay? - Yah? - Go to the other music.

664
00:41:21.419 --> 00:41:22.461
Marty, change the lights.

665
00:41:22.543 --> 00:41:24.061
Cue Angel. Let's come in at 20 seconds.

666
00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:26.253
Jack, bring up the side spots.

667
00:41:26.334 --> 00:41:27.668
All right!

668
00:41:31.543 --> 00:41:33.711
I wanna see some attitude!

669
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:36.542
I said attitude!

670
00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:38.543
Come on, ladies!

671
00:41:38.792 --> 00:41:41.836
Sell! Sell your bodies!

672
00:41:45.125 --> 00:41:46.375
Cut it!

673
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.168
Try yoga, babe, or hangin'
from the ceiling or something.

674
00:41:49.248 --> 00:41:50.915
See ya. Marty, ice.

675
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.875
You got something
wrong with your nipples?

676
00:41:54.956 --> 00:41:55.956
No.

677
00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:57.748
They're not sticking up. Stick them up.

678
00:41:57.831 --> 00:41:58.831
What?

679
00:41:58.873 --> 00:42:00.999
Play with them a little bit.

680
00:42:05.873 --> 00:42:07.290
Pinch 'em a little.

681
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:09.414
You want me to do it for ya,
I'll do it.

682
00:42:22.121 --> 00:42:23.455
I'm erect.

683
00:42:23.704 --> 00:42:25.538
Why aren't you erect?

684
00:42:29.495 --> 00:42:31.538
Here, put some ice on them.

685
00:42:40.369 --> 00:42:41.744
I called that one right.

686
00:42:41.827 --> 00:42:43.494
See ya, Pollyanna.

687
00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:47.078
That's it for today. Thank you.

688
00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.702
You got me the audition, didn't you?

689
00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:04.492
Uh-hmm. - Why?

690
00:43:06.992 --> 00:43:09.201
Maybe I like the way you dance.

691
00:43:10.118 --> 00:43:11.743
Maybe I like you.

692
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.826
What difference does it make?

693
00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:18.160
Did you enjoy that out there?

694
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:22.367
Yeah, darlin', I think I did.

695
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.325
I hate you.

696
00:43:27.073 --> 00:43:28.282
I know.

697
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:47.990
Here, wipe your nose.

698
00:43:52.113 --> 00:43:53.547
Hey the orthodontist convention
is over there.

699
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:55.321
The realtors are comin' in
in 20 minutes.

700
00:43:55.404 --> 00:43:57.071
Let's line 'em up!

701
00:44:04.029 --> 00:44:09.697
Hey. - Hey.
- What are you doing here?

702
00:44:09.779 --> 00:44:11.655
I just did an audition.

703
00:44:11.736 --> 00:44:13.320
What, you wanna be a showgirl?

704
00:44:13.404 --> 00:44:16.197
Smith, what are you doing?
Move those bags.

705
00:44:17.778 --> 00:44:19.696
Didn't go too good, huh?

706
00:44:21.529 --> 00:44:22.612
Well you know, I'm glad about that.

707
00:44:22.695 --> 00:44:24.446
Just don't, OK?
I'm not in the mood!

708
00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:25.862
Hey, Smith!

709
00:44:26.027 --> 00:44:28.028
Hey Smith, I'm talking to you.

710
00:44:29.027 --> 00:44:31.821
You don't want to be
in this kind of show.

711
00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:34.402
What you're doing,
at least it's honest.

712
00:44:34.486 --> 00:44:37.447
They want tits and ass,
you give them tits and ass.

713
00:44:37.527 --> 00:44:39.778
Here, they pretend
they want somethin' else,

714
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.944
and you still show them
tits and ass.

715
00:44:42.026 --> 00:44:44.445
You wanna work her, you work her
on your own time. You got it?

716
00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:46.276
Now go over there and start
lining up those bags.

717
00:44:46.358 --> 00:44:48.109
I'm talking to her.

718
00:44:48.608 --> 00:44:49.692
You're what?

719
00:44:49.776 --> 00:44:53.070
I said I'm talking to her. I'm not
working her. I'm talking to her.

720
00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:56.027
And you're interrupting
my conversation, and that's rude.

721
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.069
Get the fuck out of here!

722
00:44:58.775 --> 00:45:00.025
Asshole.

723
00:45:00.566 --> 00:45:01.941
You're fired!

724
00:45:02.024 --> 00:45:03.859
Yeah? Take this jacket.

725
00:45:04.315 --> 00:45:06.358
Come on. Now look what you done.

726
00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.484
You got me fired again.

727
00:45:09.024 --> 00:45:12.026
You're a real bad-ass.
Ain't you got no shame?

728
00:45:12.857 --> 00:45:14.524
You know what? What
a beautiful day it is.

729
00:45:14.606 --> 00:45:17.692
The sun's shining,
neon blazin', money's flowin'.

730
00:45:18.273 --> 00:45:19.773
I'm gonna cheer you up, you know that?

731
00:45:19.856 --> 00:45:21.481
I'm gonna get you the best meal in town.

732
00:45:21.565 --> 00:45:22.898
Yeah? - Yeah.

733
00:45:26.689 --> 00:45:28.189
You like that burger.

734
00:45:30.146 --> 00:45:31.855
Where you from?

735
00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:34.189
Different places.

736
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:37.856
You like talkin' about you, huh?

737
00:45:49.853 --> 00:45:50.936
Where are we?

738
00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:52.311
My place.

739
00:45:53.354 --> 00:45:54.396
Why?

740
00:45:54.563 --> 00:45:56.480
I wanna show you something.

741
00:46:03.477 --> 00:46:04.811
The best suite in town.

742
00:46:04.893 --> 00:46:07.228
I had to beg and plead to get it.

743
00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:15.352
This what you wanted to show me?

744
00:46:15.436 --> 00:46:17.812
What, this nice big bed here? Hm?

745
00:46:21.683 --> 00:46:23.434
I wrote this number.

746
00:46:23.934 --> 00:46:25.476
It's about you.

747
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.268
You don't know anything about me.

748
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.560
I know you're a private dancer.

749
00:46:31.518 --> 00:46:33.727
I only need three other girls.

750
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:36.936
We can put it on at the Crave Club.

751
00:46:37.851 --> 00:46:39.351
I'll show you.

752
00:46:40.059 --> 00:46:42.185
Stand right here. Watch me.

753
00:46:47.225 --> 00:46:49.143
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Slow down!

754
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:50.557
Like this?

755
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.350
Yeah. - Yeah?

756
00:47:04.806 --> 00:47:07.349
Come on now, follow me.
I know you can.

757
00:48:26.508 --> 00:48:28.801
Mmm! I have my period.

758
00:48:30.215 --> 00:48:31.632
Yeah, right.

759
00:48:32.007 --> 00:48:33.299
Check.

760
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.923
See?

761
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.841
It's all right. I got towels.

762
00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:53.922
You can fuck me when you love me.

763
00:48:58.422 --> 00:49:00.172
But I do love you.

764
00:49:00.421 --> 00:49:01.838
Yeah, right.

765
00:49:02.337 --> 00:49:05.005
You don't fool me. I see you.

766
00:49:05.964 --> 00:49:07.047
What do you see?

767
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.630
I see you hiding.

768
00:49:08.713 --> 00:49:10.047
From what?

769
00:49:10.838 --> 00:49:12.088
From you.

770
00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:20.256
You got into some bad shit
someplace, didn't you?

771
00:49:20.336 --> 00:49:22.087
Thanks for the hamburger!

772
00:49:28.002 --> 00:49:29.878
Where were you? What happened?

773
00:49:29.962 --> 00:49:32.505
Tony Moss called.
He said to call him right away.

774
00:49:32.585 --> 00:49:34.670
Here's the number. Call him.

775
00:49:35.294 --> 00:49:37.295
Oh, Jesus. I'll call him.

776
00:49:41.418 --> 00:49:43.085
Tony Moss, please.

777
00:49:43.376 --> 00:49:45.001
It's Nomi Malone.

778
00:49:47.459 --> 00:49:48.501
Yes?

779
00:49:50.376 --> 00:49:51.459
Yes.

780
00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:53.833
OK.

781
00:49:58.625 --> 00:49:59.834
I got in.

782
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:02.876
She's the yellow rose of Texas

783
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:04.584
She charges 50 bucks

784
00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.419
She's the richest whore in Texas

785
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.835
And all she does is fucks

786
00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:10.750
You're late. I'm gone.

787
00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:12.543
I got another job, Al.

788
00:50:13.332 --> 00:50:14.374
Where you going?

789
00:50:14.456 --> 00:50:16.499
You going to another club?

790
00:50:17.332 --> 00:50:20.334
They giving you
a better cut? I'll match it.

791
00:50:20.415 --> 00:50:22.833
I'm in Goddess at the Stardust.

792
00:50:27.705 --> 00:50:29.373
What's so fucking funny?

793
00:50:29.455 --> 00:50:31.748
She's going down to the Stardust.

794
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.164
She's gonna be in the show.

795
00:50:34.372 --> 00:50:35.705
Good for her.

796
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:37.957
La de dah de dah de dah.

797
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:40.579
She'll be back.

798
00:50:40.663 --> 00:50:42.122
No, I won't.

799
00:50:42.204 --> 00:50:43.996
I'll never come back.

800
00:50:44.162 --> 00:50:46.414
You're a fucking stripper.
Don't you get it?

801
00:50:46.495 --> 00:50:47.578
I'm a dancer.

802
00:50:47.663 --> 00:50:50.623
If you're a dancer, then
Henrietta's the Virgin Mary.

803
00:50:50.704 --> 00:50:52.997
I got bigger tits than
the fuckin' Virgin Mary

804
00:50:53.079 --> 00:50:55.288
and I got a bigger mouth, too.

805
00:50:55.995 --> 00:51:00.999
Hey, goddamnit, you're the only one
who could get my tits popping right.

806
00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:03.871
See ya, Al.

807
00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:06.746
I'm not hiring you back. You hear me?

808
00:51:06.828 --> 00:51:09.996
Not even if you give me
a fucking blow job!

809
00:51:19.368 --> 00:51:22.120
James! James!

810
00:51:22.202 --> 00:51:23.452
Come on!

811
00:51:24.826 --> 00:51:25.992
I got it!

812
00:51:26.075 --> 00:51:27.242
Got - got what?

813
00:51:27.325 --> 00:51:28.492
I'm in the show.

814
00:51:28.574 --> 00:51:29.950
In Goddess.

815
00:51:31.033 --> 00:51:32.367
Oh, man.

816
00:51:33.242 --> 00:51:35.701
What about the number I wrote for you?

817
00:51:35.783 --> 00:51:38.410
I thought we were workin' on something,
you and I.

818
00:51:39.782 --> 00:51:41.408
Oh, James.

819
00:51:51.991 --> 00:51:53.575
She gonna be in your number?

820
00:51:53.658 --> 00:51:55.409
I'll be right there.

821
00:51:56.157 --> 00:51:57.783
She can't dance.

822
00:51:58.698 --> 00:52:01.534
Yeah, but you're gonna
teach her, right?

823
00:52:02.532 --> 00:52:04.449
She's got talent, right?

824
00:52:07.074 --> 00:52:09.909
You know, you and me,
we ain't got no ties.

825
00:52:13.989 --> 00:52:15.782
Dancing and fucking.

826
00:52:15.988 --> 00:52:17.155
Right?

827
00:52:21.197 --> 00:52:22.322
Yeah.

828
00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:23.948
That's right.

829
00:52:25.654 --> 00:52:26.862
See ya.

830
00:52:37.113 --> 00:52:38.571
Who was that?

831
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:44.573
Ah, just somebody that wanted
to be in the number.

832
00:52:45.153 --> 00:52:47.571
You're not gonna give
her my part, are you?

833
00:52:47.653 --> 00:52:50.113
No, baby. She can't dance.

834
00:52:50.194 --> 00:52:51.236
No?

835
00:52:51.653 --> 00:52:54.446
I wrote that number for you.
You know that. Yeah.

836
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:04.443
Excuse me.

837
00:53:05.818 --> 00:53:06.901
What can I do for you?

838
00:53:06.984 --> 00:53:08.735
I'm supposed to see Mr. Moss.

839
00:53:08.817 --> 00:53:10.401
I'm Nomi Malone.

840
00:53:11.275 --> 00:53:12.776
OK. Go on in.

841
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.983
One day she looks like Pollyanna,

842
00:53:22.066 --> 00:53:24.192
the next day she looks like...

843
00:53:24.274 --> 00:53:26.317
I don't know, Lolita maybe.

844
00:53:26.983 --> 00:53:28.359
Nice dress.

845
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.733
Thanks. I bought it at "Versayce".

846
00:53:36.689 --> 00:53:38.148
In The Forum.

847
00:53:38.316 --> 00:53:40.943
Oh, yeah. "Versayce".
I love "Versayce".

848
00:53:41.024 --> 00:53:42.358
Me, too.

849
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:43.648
OK, you know Marty.

850
00:53:43.939 --> 00:53:45.606
Hi. - Hi.

851
00:53:45.815 --> 00:53:46.815
Gay's our line captain.

852
00:53:46.898 --> 00:53:48.357
Hi.

853
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.689
If you let me down,

854
00:53:50.771 --> 00:53:52.063
I could lose my reputation

855
00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:54.648
for being such an all-knowing prick.

856
00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:57.315
I worked very hard for that reputation,

857
00:53:57.397 --> 00:53:58.647
so don't do it.

858
00:53:58.729 --> 00:53:59.813
Deal?

859
00:54:00.064 --> 00:54:01.147
Deal.

860
00:54:01.312 --> 00:54:03.146
Gay will show you around.

861
00:54:03.229 --> 00:54:04.813
Let's get going.

862
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.272
Nomi. We'll do
a run-through this afternoon.

863
00:54:08.353 --> 00:54:09.728
Good luck. - Thank you.

864
00:54:09.812 --> 00:54:12.939
They always tell you that in Vegas.
Just before they take your money.

865
00:54:13.978 --> 00:54:15.312
You need to maintain your weight.

866
00:54:15.645 --> 00:54:17.896
Eat a lot of brown rice and vegetables.

867
00:54:17.979 --> 00:54:19.397
And stay indoors.

868
00:54:19.479 --> 00:54:21.021
I don't wanna see any tan lines.

869
00:54:21.104 --> 00:54:23.772
Your makeup and costumes
are your responsibility.

870
00:54:23.853 --> 00:54:25.270
Don't take 'em home.

871
00:54:25.354 --> 00:54:29.148
Whatever you do, don't ever,
ever go out on stage crying.

872
00:54:30.104 --> 00:54:32.230
You do eat brown rice and vegetables,
don't you?

873
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:33.436
Sure.

874
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.644
Good.

875
00:54:35.685 --> 00:54:37.436
This is your table.

876
00:54:37.811 --> 00:54:39.228
If you're smart,

877
00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:40.894
and I was smart,

878
00:54:40.976 --> 00:54:43.311
you'll figure out a job and a man

879
00:54:43.394 --> 00:54:44.852
for later on.

880
00:54:45.602 --> 00:54:47.061
How'd you find your guy?

881
00:54:47.142 --> 00:54:49.102
I chipped my tooth on a Quaalude.

882
00:54:49.184 --> 00:54:50.851
He was my dentist.

883
00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:53.602
You'll be running
this monster six times a night.

884
00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:55.642
Hold on to the railing,
you don't want to fall.

885
00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.267
I'll take you to Personnel.

886
00:54:57.351 --> 00:54:59.435
They want some information.

887
00:54:59.518 --> 00:55:01.227
What kind of information?

888
00:55:01.308 --> 00:55:02.809
Date of birth.

889
00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.725
7-3, um, 73.

890
00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:09.517
Place of birth.

891
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:11.641
New York.

892
00:55:11.726 --> 00:55:12.893
New York, New York?

893
00:55:12.974 --> 00:55:14.100
Yeah.

894
00:55:14.474 --> 00:55:16.350
Nearest family members.

895
00:55:23.056 --> 00:55:24.973
I don't have any family.

896
00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:26.973
Deceased?

897
00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.723
Yes.

898
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.224
Have you ever been arrested?

899
00:55:32.307 --> 00:55:34.558
Charged with a criminal offense?

900
00:55:34.639 --> 00:55:35.639
No.

901
00:55:40.013 --> 00:55:41.889
Social Security number.

902
00:55:45.097 --> 00:55:46.555
I don't know.

903
00:55:46.638 --> 00:55:48.972
Let me check on that for you, OK?

904
00:55:54.345 --> 00:55:55.387
Hey, you got it.

905
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.179
Nice goin'. That's great. - Thank you.

906
00:55:57.845 --> 00:55:59.554
Zack, this is Nomi Malone.

907
00:55:59.637 --> 00:56:01.137
Sure. I remember her. Hi.

908
00:56:01.221 --> 00:56:02.261
I bet you do remember her.

909
00:56:02.304 --> 00:56:04.389
Well, she's pretty memorable.

910
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.971
Listen, I'm glad you're part
of the team. Nice dress.

911
00:56:07.135 --> 00:56:08.719
Thanks, it's a "Versayce".

912
00:56:09.636 --> 00:56:11.095
It's "Versace".

913
00:56:11.636 --> 00:56:12.761
What?

914
00:56:13.511 --> 00:56:14.761
"Versace".

915
00:56:14.968 --> 00:56:16.886
It's pronounced "Versace". - Oh.

916
00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:22.010
You got great taste.

917
00:56:22.093 --> 00:56:23.093
You look beautiful.

918
00:56:23.177 --> 00:56:24.511
Thank you.

919
00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:28.758
Girls.

920
00:56:28.842 --> 00:56:30.218
Up at the ceiling.

921
00:56:30.301 --> 00:56:31.718
This is Nomi.

922
00:56:31.801 --> 00:56:34.260
Nicky, Julie, Deena. And you know Gay.

923
00:56:34.674 --> 00:56:37.218
They'll run through it once. You just
watch. Then we'll blend you in.

924
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.176
Have you eaten anything?

925
00:56:39.466 --> 00:56:41.133
What do you want?

926
00:56:41.216 --> 00:56:42.758
Burger, fries, and soda.

927
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.109
Get her some brown rice, vegetables,

928
00:56:44.133 --> 00:56:45.217
and a bottle of Evian.

929
00:56:45.299 --> 00:56:46.674
OK. Line it up.

930
00:56:46.757 --> 00:56:48.466
No Nomi, no no no.
Come take a look at this first.

931
00:56:50.465 --> 00:56:52.591
Here we go! 5, 6, 7, 8!

932
00:56:54.883 --> 00:56:56.217
Hoh! 2, 3!

933
00:57:00.466 --> 00:57:01.883
Hah! There!

934
00:57:01.966 --> 00:57:03.008
You gonna try now. You ready?

935
00:57:03.091 --> 00:57:04.091
Yeah.

936
00:57:04.131 --> 00:57:06.383
Try it now. 5, 6, 7, hit it!

937
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.590
Go!

938
00:57:08.673 --> 00:57:09.757
Hoh!

939
00:57:09.964 --> 00:57:11.048
Bam!

940
00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:13.006
Kick it! Work it!

941
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.465
Hold it!

942
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.341
Nomi, what kind of turn was that?

943
00:57:16.423 --> 00:57:18.800
Do a pickle turn. Come on.

944
00:57:19.463 --> 00:57:21.297
That's it. OK. Music.

945
00:57:22.047 --> 00:57:24.173
Go! Hah!

946
00:57:24.254 --> 00:57:26.255
Go! Yes!

947
00:57:27.588 --> 00:57:29.047
Hah! Higher.

948
00:57:29.129 --> 00:57:30.713
Not that high.

949
00:57:32.587 --> 00:57:34.088
Stay in sync.

950
00:57:34.797 --> 00:57:37.048
1, 2, 3, 1!

951
00:57:37.128 --> 00:57:40.923
Thrust it! Thrust it!

952
00:57:41.002 --> 00:57:42.461
Come on! Thrust it!

953
00:57:42.545 --> 00:57:43.879
Bam! OK.

954
00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:47.129
That's enough. Thank you, ladies.

955
00:57:51.294 --> 00:57:52.544
Good job. Thank you.

956
00:57:52.628 --> 00:57:55.463
Gay, work with her on her turns
and work with her on her balance.

957
00:57:56.379 --> 00:57:58.380
How long will it be before
I can be able to do the show?

958
00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.461
You're starting tonight.

959
00:58:01.585 --> 00:58:03.461
Tonight? - You'll be fine.

960
00:58:06.834 --> 00:58:07.918
How did she do?

961
00:58:08.001 --> 00:58:09.752
She's no butterfly.

962
00:58:10.459 --> 00:58:13.628
Tony, she's all
pelvic thrust. I mean, she prowls.

963
00:58:13.792 --> 00:58:14.875
She's got it.

964
00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:16.584
I wonder how she got it.

965
00:58:16.666 --> 00:58:18.000
She certainly didn't learn it.

966
00:58:18.084 --> 00:58:20.460
She learned it all right, but they
don't teach it in any class.

967
00:58:23.123 --> 00:58:25.541
Wait. You need
more orange. Let me do it.

968
00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.291
How do you feel?

969
00:58:29.373 --> 00:58:31.457
Oh! Don't ask.

970
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.375
Hey, who the hell took my makeup?

971
00:58:33.458 --> 00:58:35.125
Monkey alert! Monkey alert!

972
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:37.708
It's them again!

973
00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.875
I told you if this happened again...

974
00:58:41.957 --> 00:58:43.583
They make babies.

975
00:58:43.997 --> 00:58:45.247
Babies?

976
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.290
Oh! Oh, get out.

977
00:58:52.122 --> 00:58:54.207
Grab her! Grab her!

978
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:55.873
I've got one.

979
00:58:56.121 --> 00:58:57.455
Thank you.

980
00:58:58.246 --> 00:58:59.372
Julie, you fucking slut!

981
00:58:59.454 --> 00:59:01.288
You take my makeup again,
I'll fucking kill you!

982
00:59:01.372 --> 00:59:04.290
Oh, I'm a slut? You fucked that
kid from the pizza place.

983
00:59:04.372 --> 00:59:05.472
Well you fucked the meter reader.

984
00:59:05.496 --> 00:59:06.496
Bitch!

985
00:59:06.579 --> 00:59:08.372
You're fucking dead!

986
00:59:08.455 --> 00:59:10.164
Come on, you two!

987
00:59:11.578 --> 00:59:13.245
For Chrissakes!

988
00:59:13.828 --> 00:59:15.120
Calm down! Stop it!

989
00:59:15.203 --> 00:59:16.953
It's done! It's done!

990
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.870
Showtime.

991
00:59:22.453 --> 00:59:24.954
Move it! You got four counts of eight.

992
00:59:25.036 --> 00:59:26.870
Nomi, wait. Your wig.

993
00:59:27.037 --> 00:59:29.497
All right, you're fine.
Move up, you guys.

994
00:59:29.703 --> 00:59:31.871
There's shit on the stage.

995
00:59:31.953 --> 00:59:34.246
They always got the shits.
It's that damn garlic.

996
00:59:34.329 --> 00:59:35.871
Where is it, Jack? Up left.

997
00:59:35.953 --> 00:59:37.954
Guys, upstage left... Monkey shit.

998
00:59:38.703 --> 00:59:40.621
You want some blow?

999
00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:42.328
Last chance ice.

1000
00:59:44.619 --> 00:59:45.994
Go! Go!

1001
00:59:46.452 --> 00:59:48.119
Pickle it up. Let's go.

1002
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:50.118
Move faster. Pickle it up.

1003
00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:51.744
Brian, go!

1004
00:59:53.535 --> 00:59:54.911
See ya.

1005
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.534
All right, everybody, Let's go!

1006
00:59:57.618 --> 00:59:59.202
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1007
00:59:59.784 --> 01:00:01.242
I love you!

1008
01:00:01.449 --> 01:00:03.909
Come on, you guys. Keep it moving.

1009
01:00:08.075 --> 01:00:09.909
Nomi, wait. What?

1010
01:00:10.282 --> 01:00:11.532
Two beats.

1011
01:00:11.617 --> 01:00:13.576
1, 2. Go!

1012
01:00:24.616 --> 01:00:25.783
Shit!

1013
01:00:42.863 --> 01:00:43.988
Yeah!

1014
01:01:02.111 --> 01:01:03.195
Ladies and gentlemen,

1015
01:01:03.278 --> 01:01:05.279
the Stardust proudly presents

1016
01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.819
Miss Cristal Connors!

1017
01:01:59.773 --> 01:02:00.898
Yeah.

1018
01:02:11.107 --> 01:02:12.358
Nomi, you got two minutes.

1019
01:02:12.439 --> 01:02:13.856
Change into a red wig.

1020
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.608
I got your costume.

1021
01:02:20.065 --> 01:02:21.690
Nomi. Nomi.

1022
01:02:21.773 --> 01:02:23.273
Slip this on.

1023
01:02:23.397 --> 01:02:24.397
Did I do OK?

1024
01:02:24.439 --> 01:02:25.939
Yeah. You did fine.

1025
01:02:26.022 --> 01:02:27.356
Your right leg extension needs work.

1026
01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:28.898
It's eight steps on the sweep, not six.

1027
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.357
We'll work tomorrow. Be here at noon.

1028
01:02:31.437 --> 01:02:33.438
Put this on. You're done.

1029
01:02:38.936 --> 01:02:40.354
I didn't fall.

1030
01:02:40.436 --> 01:02:41.895
You did. You nearly fell.

1031
01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:44.981
Hey yo. Can I talk to you a minute?

1032
01:02:46.186 --> 01:02:47.770
Come on. Please.

1033
01:02:48.811 --> 01:02:49.936
Talk.

1034
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.437
Alone?

1035
01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.268
I'll go get the car.

1036
01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.102
I'll be right there.

1037
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:58.853
Yeah?

1038
01:02:59.186 --> 01:03:01.145
Who sent you the flowers?

1039
01:03:02.853 --> 01:03:04.812
None of your business.

1040
01:03:05.143 --> 01:03:07.770
OK. OK look, I just wanted to say...

1041
01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:09.977
You and me ain't got no ties.

1042
01:03:15.185 --> 01:03:17.269
I have a problem with pussy.

1043
01:03:17.768 --> 01:03:19.852
I always have, and I'm always gonna.

1044
01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.767
But I meant what I said to you.

1045
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.893
Look I'm not interested
in your problems, OK?

1046
01:03:23.973 --> 01:03:26.558
I did write it for you.

1047
01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:31.269
Yeah, but I did tell her I was
gonna teach her and I did fuck her.

1048
01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:33.016
Who you fuck is your business,

1049
01:03:33.099 --> 01:03:35.142
and I'm not making it mine.

1050
01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:38.475
You know it's not like I'm
seeing any money

1051
01:03:38.557 --> 01:03:40.433
for writing that number.

1052
01:03:41.098 --> 01:03:43.558
I may as well touch a little pussy.

1053
01:03:46.266 --> 01:03:48.601
You ain't got nothing to say?

1054
01:03:49.098 --> 01:03:50.182
No.

1055
01:03:51.431 --> 01:03:53.349
Thanks for the flowers.

1056
01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:55.766
Tony said you did great.

1057
01:03:56.431 --> 01:03:57.890
I never got flowers before.

1058
01:03:57.971 --> 01:03:59.180
Really?

1059
01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:01.932
Well, I'm sure you'll get lots of them.

1060
01:04:04.388 --> 01:04:06.097
He gave them to you?

1061
01:04:06.763 --> 01:04:08.263
Yeah, he did.

1062
01:04:08.722 --> 01:04:10.431
What is he, a pimp?

1063
01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:14.097
Only people I know
got pimp cars are pimps.

1064
01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:16.263
He's the entertainment director.

1065
01:04:16.346 --> 01:04:18.472
That's exactly what I said,
he's a pimp.

1066
01:04:18.553 --> 01:04:20.429
Hey, Nomes. Let's go.

1067
01:04:23.552 --> 01:04:25.845
Good luck with your number, James.

1068
01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:28.637
I'm sure you're gonna teach her
to be a great dancer.

1069
01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.469
Hello?

1070
01:04:53.427 --> 01:04:54.927
Anybody here?

1071
01:04:55.093 --> 01:04:56.427
Back here.

1072
01:04:58.676 --> 01:05:00.510
What are you doing here?

1073
01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:02.344
What am I doing here?

1074
01:05:04.426 --> 01:05:07.345
I'm doing some of the finest
cocaine in the world, darlin'.

1075
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.967
You want some?

1076
01:05:13.632 --> 01:05:15.759
It's great for the muscles.

1077
01:05:19.008 --> 01:05:21.843
I told Marty I'd work
on your turns with you darlin',

1078
01:05:21.923 --> 01:05:24.800
but I'm feeling a little
turned inside-out myself today.

1079
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:26.340
Cut the shit.

1080
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.923
OK.

1081
01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:31.091
We got off on the wrong foot.

1082
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:35.342
You want to start
dancing all over again?

1083
01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:36.840
Why?

1084
01:05:37.756 --> 01:05:38.964
Why not?

1085
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:43.424
You want to walk down to
Spago, get something to eat?

1086
01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:44.756
Where is it?

1087
01:05:44.838 --> 01:05:46.756
Just down from "Versayce".

1088
01:05:47.213 --> 01:05:48.380
"Versace".

1089
01:05:48.464 --> 01:05:49.797
Oh, right.

1090
01:05:50.005 --> 01:05:51.297
"Versace".

1091
01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:52.671
Yeah.

1092
01:05:53.254 --> 01:05:54.796
Right this way.

1093
01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.378
Enjoy.

1094
01:06:10.627 --> 01:06:12.378
I don't know what all this stuff is.

1095
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:14.211
I'll order for you.

1096
01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:18.252
Don't they have
brown rice and vegetables?

1097
01:06:19.044 --> 01:06:21.503
Do you like brown rice
and vegetables?

1098
01:06:21.585 --> 01:06:22.668
Yeah.

1099
01:06:23.627 --> 01:06:24.836
You do?

1100
01:06:25.794 --> 01:06:27.045
Sort of.

1101
01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:29.543
Really?

1102
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:34.753
It's worse than dog food.

1103
01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:36.542
It is.

1104
01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:40.585
I've had dog food.

1105
01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:43.958
You have?

1106
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.375
A long time ago.

1107
01:06:48.582 --> 01:06:49.957
Doggy Chow.

1108
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.500
I used to love Doggy Chow.

1109
01:06:54.582 --> 01:06:56.916
I used to love Doggy Chow, too.

1110
01:07:09.748 --> 01:07:11.832
I get a headache from champagne.

1111
01:07:11.913 --> 01:07:14.165
Oh, this isn't champagne.

1112
01:07:15.415 --> 01:07:17.124
This is holy water.

1113
01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:22.081
I named myself after this holy water.

1114
01:07:22.707 --> 01:07:24.916
Chrissie Lou Connors
used to have dingy brown hair

1115
01:07:24.998 --> 01:07:26.915
and little bitty tits.

1116
01:07:27.246 --> 01:07:30.165
It's amazing what paint
and a surgeon can do.

1117
01:07:39.329 --> 01:07:41.079
You have great tits.

1118
01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:43.955
They're really beautiful.

1119
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.954
Thank you.

1120
01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.078
I like nice tits.

1121
01:07:50.245 --> 01:07:52.413
I always have. How about you?

1122
01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.245
I like having nice tits.

1123
01:07:56.953 --> 01:07:59.079
How do you like having them?

1124
01:08:03.368 --> 01:08:04.994
What do you mean?

1125
01:08:05.993 --> 01:08:07.744
You know what I mean.

1126
01:08:12.327 --> 01:08:16.455
I like having them
in a nice dress or a tight top.

1127
01:08:19.825 --> 01:08:21.826
You like to show 'em off.

1128
01:08:24.702 --> 01:08:27.620
I didn't like
showing them off at the Cheetah.

1129
01:08:27.742 --> 01:08:30.910
Why not?
I liked looking at 'em there.

1130
01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.284
Everybody liked looking at 'em there.

1131
01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:36.491
Made me feel like a hooker.

1132
01:08:36.574 --> 01:08:38.366
You are a whore, darlin'.

1133
01:08:38.449 --> 01:08:39.866
No, I'm not.

1134
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.325
We all are.

1135
01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:44.117
We take the cash, we cash the check,

1136
01:08:44.198 --> 01:08:46.575
we show them what they want to see.

1137
01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.074
Maybe you are a whore,
Cristal, but I am not.

1138
01:08:52.487 --> 01:08:53.946
You and me...

1139
01:08:55.156 --> 01:08:56.906
We're exactly alike.

1140
01:09:06.696 --> 01:09:08.572
I'll never be like you.

1141
01:09:13.404 --> 01:09:15.613
Miss Connors. Sorry to bother you.

1142
01:09:15.696 --> 01:09:17.655
Would you sign this for me?

1143
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.696
I'd be happy to darlin'. What's your name?

1144
01:09:19.778 --> 01:09:22.405
Frank. I'm from Galveston.

1145
01:09:22.487 --> 01:09:25.281
Well, I'm just a farm girl
from Del Rio myself, Frank.

1146
01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.362
I told you she was from Texas.

1147
01:09:27.445 --> 01:09:28.903
Woo, hey look at that.

1148
01:09:29.362 --> 01:09:31.113
Could I have me one just like that?

1149
01:09:31.235 --> 01:09:34.404
You want a girl to use up
all her lipstick on you?

1150
01:09:34.943 --> 01:09:36.485
You want to dance?

1151
01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:37.610
Right now?

1152
01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:38.901
It's now or never.

1153
01:09:38.984 --> 01:09:40.901
That's what Elvis said.

1154
01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.986
Know the best advice I ever got?

1155
01:09:47.694 --> 01:09:51.447
You're up there
onstage, hoping on a spot.

1156
01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:55.196
If someone gets in your way,
step on 'em.

1157
01:09:55.819 --> 01:09:57.945
If you're the only one
left standing there,

1158
01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.610
they hire you.

1159
01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:03.279
That's about it. Thank you and
good night, ladies and gentlemen.

1160
01:10:03.358 --> 01:10:05.359
Elvis has left the building.

1161
01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.894
You see, darlin'?

1162
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.062
You are a whore.

1163
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:20.728
Bitch.

1164
01:11:25.892 --> 01:11:27.643
I guess we're done.

1165
01:11:33.269 --> 01:11:35.603
Right here. Right here.

1166
01:11:35.851 --> 01:11:37.184
Thank you.

1167
01:11:39.934 --> 01:11:41.893
Nicky, can I talk to you for a second?

1168
01:11:41.975 --> 01:11:44.018
Listen, after the show...

1169
01:11:46.726 --> 01:11:48.393
Coming through.

1170
01:11:49.725 --> 01:11:50.975
Mommy, can we see the monkeys?

1171
01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.349
Not now honey. They're busy.

1172
01:11:52.434 --> 01:11:54.351
Please mommy, they're so cute.

1173
01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:55.599
They have to work, sweetheart.

1174
01:11:55.682 --> 01:11:57.099
What are they doing, mommy?

1175
01:11:57.181 --> 01:11:59.099
I want to see the monkeys!
I want to see the monkeys!

1176
01:11:59.183 --> 01:12:00.684
Why can't we see the monkeys?

1177
01:12:00.766 --> 01:12:03.226
Will you get these fucking kids
out of here?

1178
01:12:03.765 --> 01:12:05.349
She said the "F" word.

1179
01:12:05.432 --> 01:12:06.890
She said the "F" word.

1180
01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:08.308
She said the "F" word.

1181
01:12:08.389 --> 01:12:10.265
Shut the fuck up.

1182
01:12:13.889 --> 01:12:15.223
It's OK.

1183
01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:18.472
It's OK. It's OK.

1184
01:12:18.555 --> 01:12:20.597
Let's get out of here.

1185
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:24.975
Nomi. Listen, there's a boat convention
coming into town next week.

1186
01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:26.307
They need a couple of girls.

1187
01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:28.140
Nicky's doing it. You interested?

1188
01:12:28.222 --> 01:12:29.556
Pays 1,000 dollars.

1189
01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.557
$1,000? - Yeah.

1190
01:12:34.013 --> 01:12:35.138
To do what?

1191
01:12:35.222 --> 01:12:37.015
Just represent your hotel for a day.

1192
01:12:37.097 --> 01:12:39.724
Wear your costumes and your smile
and they take your picture.

1193
01:12:41.053 --> 01:12:43.305
$1,000?

1194
01:12:44.512 --> 01:12:45.595
Uh-hmm.

1195
01:12:46.555 --> 01:12:47.596
Great.

1196
01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:49.847
Cristal here recommended you.

1197
01:12:52.721 --> 01:12:54.013
Thanks.

1198
01:12:54.261 --> 01:12:56.053
My pleasure, darlin'.

1199
01:12:56.386 --> 01:12:57.970
Just looking out for you.

1200
01:12:58.053 --> 01:12:59.762
Oh Cristal we got to talk about
that magazine layout.

1201
01:12:59.844 --> 01:13:01.136
Later. Later.

1202
01:13:01.219 --> 01:13:02.261
Don't do it.

1203
01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.929
What? It's $1,000. Why not?

1204
01:13:05.011 --> 01:13:06.177
Molly, I need you.

1205
01:13:06.261 --> 01:13:07.886
Yes, I'm coming.

1206
01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.760
I know girls who've done it before.

1207
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:11.552
Molly, I'm waiting.

1208
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:14.802
They didn't like it.

1209
01:13:20.759 --> 01:13:21.968
Did you do it before?

1210
01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:23.051
Yeah.

1211
01:13:23.134 --> 01:13:24.467
Did you like it?

1212
01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:26.135
Did I like it?

1213
01:13:26.217 --> 01:13:27.884
Sure, I liked it.

1214
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.675
Let's hear it for these two
beautiful girls from Goddess,

1215
01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:59.132
the new smash at the Stardust.

1216
01:14:01.338 --> 01:14:02.463
Thank you.

1217
01:14:02.547 --> 01:14:03.630
Pardon me.

1218
01:14:03.714 --> 01:14:05.506
Hey, hey guys.

1219
01:14:05.587 --> 01:14:06.796
Shit. Here he comes.

1220
01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.964
How's it goin'?

1221
01:14:08.047 --> 01:14:09.047
Fine.

1222
01:14:09.089 --> 01:14:10.464
Tough gig, huh?

1223
01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:11.880
Very tough.

1224
01:14:11.964 --> 01:14:13.506
This is my good friend Mr. Okida.

1225
01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.255
He's from Bangkok.

1226
01:14:15.463 --> 01:14:18.173
He's one of our very, very high rollers.

1227
01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:19.962
Ladies, we got a great idea.

1228
01:14:20.045 --> 01:14:22.630
We want to take you girls to
dinner tonight after the show.

1229
01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:26.632
Have some lobster, hear Caesar
sing. Ever heard Caesar sing?

1230
01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.796
Man, that guy's great.

1231
01:14:28.877 --> 01:14:30.336
You'll love him.

1232
01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.795
Caesar sing.

1233
01:14:31.877 --> 01:14:33.044
Yeah. Caesar will sing,

1234
01:14:33.127 --> 01:14:34.627
and we'll go back to my place

1235
01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:36.920
and we'll sing,
just the four of us.

1236
01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.752
How about it?

1237
01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.294
We sing.

1238
01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:49.836
Yeah. We'll sing a lotta songs.

1239
01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.003
Yeah?

1240
01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:53.959
OK.

1241
01:14:54.209 --> 01:14:58.421
OK. Good deal.

1242
01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:02.584
Not me.

1243
01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:05.084
Excuse me.

1244
01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:09.169
Hey, hey! Be nice.

1245
01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:10.543
Get your hands off me!

1246
01:15:10.626 --> 01:15:12.502
Listen you're getting $1,000 for this.

1247
01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:13.875
For this!

1248
01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.126
This!

1249
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.126
Hey forget it. Just forget it.

1250
01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:19.459
No harm done. No damage.

1251
01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:21.708
Christ.

1252
01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.001
Is that right?

1253
01:15:24.457 --> 01:15:25.541
OK. Tell me another one.

1254
01:15:25.623 --> 01:15:26.623
No, it's the truth.

1255
01:15:26.708 --> 01:15:28.542
Just tell me one more.

1256
01:15:29.832 --> 01:15:30.873
Zack.

1257
01:15:30.956 --> 01:15:31.998
Yeah?

1258
01:15:32.081 --> 01:15:33.873
I wanna talk to you.

1259
01:15:34.873 --> 01:15:35.957
Sure.

1260
01:15:37.373 --> 01:15:39.040
Let's go upstairs.

1261
01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:41.707
Did you have a nice day, darlin'?

1262
01:15:43.123 --> 01:15:44.164
No.

1263
01:15:47.121 --> 01:15:48.997
I'm sorry to hear that.

1264
01:15:52.164 --> 01:15:53.331
Jesus.

1265
01:15:56.955 --> 01:15:58.289
I'm sorry.

1266
01:15:58.871 --> 01:16:01.081
Some people just don't get it.

1267
01:16:02.205 --> 01:16:04.790
I'm on the stage. Get me
Phil Newkirk, would you?

1268
01:16:05.412 --> 01:16:06.578
Right.

1269
01:16:07.036 --> 01:16:08.370
Thank you.

1270
01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:09.913
I want you to stay.

1271
01:16:11.954 --> 01:16:15.331
Yeah. The drop is up 33%
on those 58 machines.

1272
01:16:15.412 --> 01:16:17.997
It's gonna make your bottom line about 250.

1273
01:16:18.078 --> 01:16:19.245
Right.

1274
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.202
OK.

1275
01:16:22.576 --> 01:16:24.452
I got an MBA for this.

1276
01:16:25.077 --> 01:16:27.453
That's what this business has come to,

1277
01:16:27.536 --> 01:16:29.912
cost-analyzing every slot machine.

1278
01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.618
What's an MBA?

1279
01:16:32.702 --> 01:16:35.203
An MBA is a degree...
- Zack, you in here?

1280
01:16:35.285 --> 01:16:36.368
Yeah.

1281
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.033
Excuse me.

1282
01:16:38.951 --> 01:16:41.327
Hey, hey, hey. What's goin' on?

1283
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:43.619
I ever hear this again,
you're out of here.

1284
01:16:43.701 --> 01:16:44.784
Nothing happened.

1285
01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.659
Yeah, something happened.

1286
01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:47.951
She's jumping to conclusions, Zack.

1287
01:16:48.034 --> 01:16:50.369
If that happens here again, to anybody,

1288
01:16:50.865 --> 01:16:53.367
you're going to jump to your conclusion

1289
01:16:53.449 --> 01:16:55.659
without your golden parachute.

1290
01:16:57.199 --> 01:16:59.033
You owe her an apology.

1291
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:04.616
Uhm, Nomi I'm sorry. I apologize.

1292
01:17:05.781 --> 01:17:07.365
Yeah, fine. OK.

1293
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.782
Get out of here.

1294
01:17:11.864 --> 01:17:12.990
Yeah.

1295
01:17:13.531 --> 01:17:14.758
Give me juice on three and four.

1296
01:17:14.782 --> 01:17:16.866
An MBA's a degree
you pickle up in college.

1297
01:17:16.947 --> 01:17:19.657
It's mostly worthless in the real world.

1298
01:17:20.114 --> 01:17:22.073
OK let's get an audio check.

1299
01:17:22.988 --> 01:17:24.947
You go for it, don't you?

1300
01:17:25.571 --> 01:17:27.114
Yeah, I try to.

1301
01:17:31.154 --> 01:17:32.446
Showtime.

1302
01:17:33.364 --> 01:17:35.115
That's for sure.

1303
01:17:35.947 --> 01:17:38.115
Right, bring both of those back up.

1304
01:17:44.863 --> 01:17:47.490
Phil, you dumb fuck, get back up here.

1305
01:17:48.736 --> 01:17:50.028
I know. I know.

1306
01:17:59.195 --> 01:18:01.280
I wanna thank you
for lookin' out for me.

1307
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:04.029
It was so nice of you
to recommend me to Phil.

1308
01:18:04.278 --> 01:18:06.070
What are friends for?

1309
01:18:07.361 --> 01:18:08.528
Right.

1310
01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:16.654
Molly. You were right
about the convention.

1311
01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:19.902
Ooh. Sweet baby.

1312
01:18:21.192 --> 01:18:23.568
Do that again and I'll break
your fucking fingers.

1313
01:18:23.650 --> 01:18:26.318
Hey I can't help it
you don't have a gay partner.

1314
01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:27.402
Fuck you.

1315
01:18:27.484 --> 01:18:30.569
He wants everybody
to see how hetero he is.

1316
01:18:30.651 --> 01:18:32.360
Molly, could you bring that
flashlight over here.

1317
01:18:32.443 --> 01:18:33.986
I want to see how big it is.

1318
01:18:34.067 --> 01:18:35.943
You want a knuckle sandwich?

1319
01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:38.067
Aw, can I have mine anally?

1320
01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:40.401
Come on, you guys stop. Jesus.

1321
01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.817
Everybody here? Let's go,
let's line it up.

1322
01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:44.442
What are you looking at, bitch?

1323
01:18:44.525 --> 01:18:47.193
All right. Let's go. Go, go, go!

1324
01:19:26.187 --> 01:19:27.604
Oh, my God.

1325
01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:57.602
Oh, my God. Are you OK, Annie?

1326
01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:13.976
Don't move.

1327
01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.059
Is it broken?

1328
01:20:15.142 --> 01:20:16.142
They don't know.

1329
01:20:16.184 --> 01:20:17.601
It's my leg.

1330
01:20:17.767 --> 01:20:19.559
Tell me when you feel something.

1331
01:20:21.225 --> 01:20:22.642
It's her knee.

1332
01:20:22.725 --> 01:20:24.393
It isn't broken, is it?

1333
01:20:24.475 --> 01:20:26.268
Daryl, what happened?

1334
01:20:26.349 --> 01:20:27.766
My foot went out from under me.

1335
01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.016
This is what happened.

1336
01:20:35.349 --> 01:20:37.600
I wonder how those got up there.

1337
01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:39.099
They probably came off a costume.

1338
01:20:40.264 --> 01:20:42.515
It's OK honey, we're gonna
take you to the hospital.

1339
01:20:43.223 --> 01:20:45.015
Shit no. - Jesus. Poor Annie.

1340
01:20:45.513 --> 01:20:46.930
Tough break.

1341
01:20:47.014 --> 01:20:48.848
Let us through here, please.

1342
01:20:52.138 --> 01:20:53.889
OK. See you later.

1343
01:20:55.389 --> 01:20:56.572
It's my decision. I'm the producer.

1344
01:20:56.596 --> 01:20:58.264
I hired your show. You're my producer.

1345
01:20:58.345 --> 01:21:01.681
She was my understudy.
I want a voice in this.

1346
01:21:01.762 --> 01:21:04.222
You can have a voice in this,
but I'm making the decision.

1347
01:21:04.305 --> 01:21:06.056
It is broken, kids.

1348
01:21:06.137 --> 01:21:08.806
Shit. That'll be three months.

1349
01:21:09.388 --> 01:21:10.680
At least.

1350
01:21:12.928 --> 01:21:14.220
Bad karma, huh?

1351
01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:16.805
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you.

1352
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:18.804
My mother?

1353
01:21:19.303 --> 01:21:21.888
Well for your sake, I hope she's not.

1354
01:21:24.177 --> 01:21:26.470
If a light sleeper
can sleep with a light on,

1355
01:21:26.552 --> 01:21:28.929
can a hard sleeper
sleep with a hard-on?

1356
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.011
What do you call a tiger?

1357
01:21:32.718 --> 01:21:34.052
Henry!

1358
01:21:37.342 --> 01:21:40.636
I can get shit on, but I
don't like getting spit on.

1359
01:21:42.009 --> 01:21:43.051
Hi.

1360
01:21:43.133 --> 01:21:44.342
Hi, Al.

1361
01:21:45.258 --> 01:21:46.883
You look like shit.

1362
01:21:46.967 --> 01:21:50.344
She looks better than a
10-inch dick, and you know it.

1363
01:21:51.467 --> 01:21:53.677
So, you like it here?

1364
01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.468
What do you think,
she's gonna miss you?

1365
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:58.051
Yeah. Why not?

1366
01:21:58.549 --> 01:21:59.800
We miss her.

1367
01:21:59.883 --> 01:22:02.343
She misses us like that lump on my twat

1368
01:22:02.424 --> 01:22:04.092
I had taken off last week.

1369
01:22:04.173 --> 01:22:05.507
Jesus, Henry.

1370
01:22:13.589 --> 01:22:15.131
I saw the show.

1371
01:22:16.838 --> 01:22:18.339
You were good.

1372
01:22:20.214 --> 01:22:21.714
Thank you, Al.

1373
01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:27.838
Real good.

1374
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:33.672
You take care, kid.

1375
01:22:39.545 --> 01:22:42.881
Must be weird not having
anybody come on ya.

1376
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:51.005
Nomi. You want a ride?

1377
01:22:53.921 --> 01:22:55.213
I got one.

1378
01:22:55.296 --> 01:22:57.464
OK. Good night.

1379
01:22:59.836 --> 01:23:00.920
Wait.

1380
01:23:04.836 --> 01:23:06.587
You ever been in one of these?

1381
01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:07.671
No.

1382
01:23:08.295 --> 01:23:10.171
I always wanted one.

1383
01:23:12.127 --> 01:23:13.336
Some car, isn't it?

1384
01:23:13.419 --> 01:23:15.170
It doesn't suck.

1385
01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:17.459
All right. Where we headed?

1386
01:23:17.542 --> 01:23:19.794
You have to give me directions.

1387
01:23:20.751 --> 01:23:22.252
To your place.

1388
01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.626
Do you like Cristal?

1389
01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:46.459
I like a lot of different champagnes,

1390
01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.209
but I always stick with champagne.

1391
01:23:51.332 --> 01:23:53.333
What's Andrew Carver like?

1392
01:23:53.791 --> 01:23:55.166
Are you nervous?

1393
01:23:55.582 --> 01:23:56.832
Don't be.

1394
01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:58.749
I'm not.

1395
01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.165
I liked it when you came.

1396
01:24:09.623 --> 01:24:11.290
I liked your eyes.

1397
01:27:21.147 --> 01:27:22.981
Hey. Stay with me.

1398
01:27:24.563 --> 01:27:26.606
I'll drive you back in the morning.

1399
01:27:26.688 --> 01:27:28.189
It is morning.

1400
01:27:28.855 --> 01:27:30.064
Please?

1401
01:27:30.148 --> 01:27:31.982
I've got a taxi coming.

1402
01:27:32.355 --> 01:27:33.813
Send it back.

1403
01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:41.605
Cristal needs a new understudy.

1404
01:27:43.104 --> 01:27:44.647
There's an audition at noon.

1405
01:27:44.728 --> 01:27:46.312
You wanna try?

1406
01:27:48.145 --> 01:27:50.813
Would you have told me about it
if I hadn't come here?

1407
01:27:51.353 --> 01:27:53.604
It wasn't my idea
to come here. It was yours.

1408
01:27:58.978 --> 01:28:00.854
I want to see you again.

1409
01:28:02.437 --> 01:28:04.271
We'll see how it goes.

1410
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.771
What, the audition?

1411
01:28:20.311 --> 01:28:21.478
$10.50.

1412
01:28:22.518 --> 01:28:24.144
Thanks. - Thank you.

1413
01:28:30.849 --> 01:28:32.016
Hello.

1414
01:28:33.101 --> 01:28:36.103
Mmm. I hate you.

1415
01:28:37.141 --> 01:28:38.558
Who was he?

1416
01:28:38.641 --> 01:28:39.641
Zack.

1417
01:28:39.724 --> 01:28:41.099
Oh, my God.

1418
01:28:42.099 --> 01:28:43.767
Did you tie him up?

1419
01:28:44.265 --> 01:28:45.766
Oh, shit. What?

1420
01:28:46.099 --> 01:28:47.892
I forgot to untie him.

1421
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:53.725
Are you high?

1422
01:28:53.807 --> 01:28:55.308
Maybe a little.

1423
01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.724
Oh. I can't go to sleep now.

1424
01:28:58.806 --> 01:29:00.515
I've got an audition at noon.

1425
01:29:00.598 --> 01:29:02.390
Where are the Sugar Snaps?

1426
01:29:02.473 --> 01:29:03.514
In the cupboard.

1427
01:29:03.598 --> 01:29:06.683
Nomi, don't get sucked into it.

1428
01:29:09.056 --> 01:29:11.140
Uh-oh. Look what I found.

1429
01:29:14.138 --> 01:29:15.931
OK. Whatever, Nomes.

1430
01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:47.470
Julie.

1431
01:29:48.053 --> 01:29:49.720
She's not hot enough, Ton.

1432
01:29:49.802 --> 01:29:51.053
She's got it down.

1433
01:29:51.135 --> 01:29:53.345
You can teach them to get it down.

1434
01:29:53.428 --> 01:29:54.720
She doesn't have Cristal's heat.

1435
01:29:54.801 --> 01:29:57.136
Yeah well, none of them
have Cristal's heat.

1436
01:29:57.843 --> 01:29:59.594
I do love you, Gay.

1437
01:30:00.219 --> 01:30:01.802
Nomi's got heat.

1438
01:30:03.133 --> 01:30:04.634
Does she now?

1439
01:30:05.259 --> 01:30:07.052
Yes, she does.

1440
01:30:08.009 --> 01:30:10.552
Oh. In a totally
different way, of course.

1441
01:30:10.634 --> 01:30:11.717
Come on.

1442
01:30:11.799 --> 01:30:13.383
She's going to take the lead?

1443
01:30:13.467 --> 01:30:15.259
This is a hotel show.

1444
01:30:15.424 --> 01:30:16.549
This isn't the Cheetah.

1445
01:30:16.633 --> 01:30:18.383
Nobody's taking my lead anyway, darlin'.

1446
01:30:18.466 --> 01:30:20.300
I haven't missed a show in eight years.

1447
01:30:20.382 --> 01:30:22.717
But you're not getting
any younger, darlin'.

1448
01:30:22.799 --> 01:30:23.966
Eat me.

1449
01:30:24.673 --> 01:30:25.882
You wanna do it again with just Nomi?

1450
01:30:25.965 --> 01:30:26.965
No.

1451
01:30:27.049 --> 01:30:28.966
Yeah, I do. Set it up, Marty.

1452
01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:30.759
This is bullshit.

1453
01:30:31.258 --> 01:30:32.926
It's about your dick.

1454
01:30:33.008 --> 01:30:34.926
Nicky, Julie, thank you.

1455
01:30:35.299 --> 01:30:36.466
What do we know about her?

1456
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:38.218
Nothin'. I'm not even sure she gave us

1457
01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.442
the right Social Security number.

1458
01:30:39.466 --> 01:30:40.549
Find out, would you?

1459
01:30:40.632 --> 01:30:42.216
Find out what? - Everything.
- All right.

1460
01:30:56.797 --> 01:30:59.007
You fucked her, didn't you?

1461
01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:02.007
That piss you off
because you're jealous, Cris,

1462
01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:05.839
or because I beat you to the punch?

1463
01:31:26.794 --> 01:31:27.920
You fuck him for the spot

1464
01:31:28.003 --> 01:31:29.962
or you fuck him because you wanted to?

1465
01:31:33.627 --> 01:31:35.794
I say you did it for the spot.

1466
01:31:36.585 --> 01:31:38.794
Is that what you did, Cristal?

1467
01:31:39.835 --> 01:31:43.296
You don't want to piss me off
darlin', now that we're friends.

1468
01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:46.587
No. You shouldn't get pissed off.

1469
01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:48.877
It makes you look older.

1470
01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:55.375
Nomi.

1471
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:56.792
Yeah?

1472
01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.876
You got it.

1473
01:31:58.958 --> 01:32:00.292
I do? Yeah.

1474
01:32:01.333 --> 01:32:03.584
Marty and Gay are going
to work with you.

1475
01:32:03.666 --> 01:32:05.709
I'll talk to Phil.
We'll get some glossies taken.

1476
01:32:05.789 --> 01:32:07.248
You did good.

1477
01:32:07.957 --> 01:32:10.500
I'll call you for dinner.
We'll have some lobster.

1478
01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.792
Did you ever hear Caesar
sing? You'll love it.

1479
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:25.373
What?

1480
01:32:27.581 --> 01:32:29.165
Congratulations.

1481
01:32:29.373 --> 01:32:31.458
I see you have many talents.

1482
01:32:31.955 --> 01:32:33.831
I thought she did good.

1483
01:32:55.535 --> 01:32:57.745
I didn't even know
about the audition

1484
01:32:57.829 --> 01:32:59.455
until afterwards.

1485
01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:04.620
Do you like my nails?

1486
01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.454
Not as nice as yours.

1487
01:33:23.951 --> 01:33:26.661
Maybe I'll help you with yours sometime.

1488
01:33:31.117 --> 01:33:32.534
If you want.

1489
01:33:36.284 --> 01:33:38.577
Isn't that nice of you, darlin'?

1490
01:33:39.325 --> 01:33:41.117
What are friends for?

1491
01:33:49.325 --> 01:33:51.117
On second thought...

1492
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:55.408
I'm not sure I want you to do mine.

1493
01:33:57.073 --> 01:34:00.451
I'm getting a little too old
for that whorey look.

1494
01:34:02.325 --> 01:34:04.117
I'll think about it.

1495
01:34:05.448 --> 01:34:06.489
OK.

1496
01:34:07.781 --> 01:34:10.033
Close the door on your way out.

1497
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:07.444
Hey! Bring on the real dancers!

1498
01:35:16.317 --> 01:35:19.360
Get off the stage! Shit! Get off there!

1499
01:35:19.983 --> 01:35:22.776
All right! All right!
Enough of this stuff.

1500
01:35:22.858 --> 01:35:24.317
Let's dance!

1501
01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:37.440
I loved it.

1502
01:35:37.689 --> 01:35:38.981
It was good.

1503
01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:40.859
What are you doing here? Slumming?

1504
01:35:40.941 --> 01:35:41.983
Heather!

1505
01:35:42.065 --> 01:35:43.149
Hope!

1506
01:35:44.191 --> 01:35:45.274
Were we good?

1507
01:35:45.356 --> 01:35:46.565
You were great.

1508
01:35:46.649 --> 01:35:48.567
She dances like a truck.

1509
01:35:48.772 --> 01:35:50.148
I do not!

1510
01:35:50.857 --> 01:35:52.041
Do you want something to drink?

1511
01:35:52.065 --> 01:35:54.108
Yeah, get me a beer, bitch.

1512
01:35:55.606 --> 01:35:57.231
Look what I got.

1513
01:35:59.647 --> 01:36:00.981
It's beautiful.

1514
01:36:01.063 --> 01:36:03.231
I stole it from my grandmother.

1515
01:36:03.314 --> 01:36:06.274
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop.

1516
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.104
We're gettin' married.

1517
01:36:19.771 --> 01:36:21.272
You love her?

1518
01:36:22.312 --> 01:36:24.730
I don't know. She's havin' a baby.

1519
01:36:29.768 --> 01:36:31.436
What about this?

1520
01:36:32.102 --> 01:36:34.020
We ain't any good. You heard them.

1521
01:36:34.104 --> 01:36:36.939
"Get outta here! Get off the stage!"

1522
01:36:38.519 --> 01:36:40.353
What are you gonna do?

1523
01:36:41.518 --> 01:36:43.436
Work in a grocery store.

1524
01:36:43.768 --> 01:36:45.603
Her mother owns it.

1525
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:48.603
We'll get a discount on baby food.

1526
01:37:00.599 --> 01:37:01.765
See ya.

1527
01:37:05.641 --> 01:37:07.309
Shit happens, you know?

1528
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:10.267
Life sucks. I'm a student of T-shirts.

1529
01:37:21.806 --> 01:37:23.182
Hey, Nicky.

1530
01:37:50.428 --> 01:37:52.053
Hey, excuse me. Wait! You cannot go...

1531
01:37:52.138 --> 01:37:53.180
What's going on?

1532
01:37:53.262 --> 01:37:54.902
Fuck! What do you mean,
"What's going on?"

1533
01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:56.262
Hey, cool it, all right?

1534
01:37:56.344 --> 01:37:57.595
Cool it?

1535
01:37:58.387 --> 01:38:00.013
You told me I got it,
then sent me this?

1536
01:38:00.094 --> 01:38:02.862
I didn't have a choice. She threatened
to walk, she got her lawyers in.

1537
01:38:02.886 --> 01:38:03.886
So what?

1538
01:38:03.927 --> 01:38:06.470
So she's a big star.
You're not worth it.

1539
01:38:07.677 --> 01:38:09.928
I'm sorry, Nomi. I tried.

1540
01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:11.635
Fuck!

1541
01:38:12.135 --> 01:38:14.178
My G-string snapped.

1542
01:38:14.262 --> 01:38:17.181
So there I was, dancing buck
naked for five minutes.

1543
01:38:17.261 --> 01:38:19.429
I mean, my poor partner.

1544
01:38:21.761 --> 01:38:25.097
Hey, I thought about it, darlin'.

1545
01:38:26.552 --> 01:38:29.053
You think you could do my nails now?

1546
01:38:34.968 --> 01:38:36.051
OK.

1547
01:38:36.259 --> 01:38:38.260
Maybe some other time.

1548
01:40:49.332 --> 01:40:51.876
Come on, slave girl.

1549
01:40:57.373 --> 01:40:58.957
Let's go! Go! Go!

1550
01:41:00.498 --> 01:41:01.832
Run, run, run! Go!

1551
01:41:01.914 --> 01:41:04.040
Go! Go! Run!

1552
01:41:12.079 --> 01:41:13.121
You guys, let me through!

1553
01:41:13.205 --> 01:41:14.873
Oh, my God!

1554
01:41:15.122 --> 01:41:16.289
Shit!

1555
01:41:17.745 --> 01:41:18.745
Cristal, can you hear me?

1556
01:41:20.163 --> 01:41:21.580
Somebody get Marty here!

1557
01:41:21.662 --> 01:41:22.829
Marty!

1558
01:41:26.995 --> 01:41:29.079
What the hell happened? - I don't know.

1559
01:41:29.162 --> 01:41:31.163
Somebody get an ambulance. Now!

1560
01:41:31.244 --> 01:41:32.703
Who was behind her?

1561
01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:33.953
I was.

1562
01:41:34.744 --> 01:41:36.245
What happened?

1563
01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.953
I don't know. She just went down.

1564
01:41:40.911 --> 01:41:42.287
She slipped.

1565
01:41:42.368 --> 01:41:43.618
I saw it.

1566
01:41:45.244 --> 01:41:47.453
Nomi wasn't even close to her.

1567
01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.826
Tough break, huh?

1568
01:42:09.575 --> 01:42:10.992
What's the matter?

1569
01:42:11.074 --> 01:42:12.324
Nothing.

1570
01:42:32.657 --> 01:42:33.824
All right. Thanks.

1571
01:42:33.907 --> 01:42:35.491
Keep me informed.

1572
01:42:36.697 --> 01:42:38.364
Well, she's got a concussion.

1573
01:42:38.447 --> 01:42:39.823
That'll be all right.

1574
01:42:39.906 --> 01:42:41.907
But she's got a compound
fracture of the right hip.

1575
01:42:41.988 --> 01:42:43.155
Oh, Christ.

1576
01:42:43.238 --> 01:42:45.739
You know how long
those take to heal?

1577
01:42:46.447 --> 01:42:47.823
We got to shut the show down.

1578
01:42:47.904 --> 01:42:50.739
Not a chance. The show goes on.

1579
01:42:51.572 --> 01:42:54.407
The Stardust is never
dark. It's never been.

1580
01:42:54.987 --> 01:42:57.572
It never will be,
not while I'm alive.

1581
01:42:59.070 --> 01:43:00.988
Who was her understudy?

1582
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:02.653
Well, we had a girl who...

1583
01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:05.319
What's funny?

1584
01:43:05.404 --> 01:43:07.655
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam.

1585
01:43:07.944 --> 01:43:09.987
You can't just replace her.

1586
01:43:14.818 --> 01:43:16.610
What if we could just bring

1587
01:43:16.694 --> 01:43:17.986
somebody in while she's recuperating?

1588
01:43:18.068 --> 01:43:19.443
She could be out a year.

1589
01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:20.777
Like who?

1590
01:43:21.235 --> 01:43:23.111
Janet Jackson. Paula Abdul.

1591
01:43:23.192 --> 01:43:24.192
Paula Abdul.

1592
01:43:24.234 --> 01:43:25.234
Jesus, Phil. In my show?

1593
01:43:25.319 --> 01:43:27.946
We're not gonna pay
those kind of salaries.

1594
01:43:28.027 --> 01:43:31.655
Well in that case, Mr. Karlman,
we do what we do in Vegas.

1595
01:43:32.694 --> 01:43:33.819
What?

1596
01:43:33.901 --> 01:43:35.360
We gamble.

1597
01:43:38.026 --> 01:43:39.652
Ladies and gentlemen,

1598
01:43:39.733 --> 01:43:42.110
the Stardust proudly presents...

1599
01:43:42.192 --> 01:43:44.068
Miss Nomi Malone!

1600
01:44:51.395 --> 01:44:53.396
We could've brought anyone
into this show,

1601
01:44:53.478 --> 01:44:55.729
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul.

1602
01:44:55.894 --> 01:44:59.647
Nomi Malone is what
Las Vegas is all about.

1603
01:44:59.725 --> 01:45:04.396
She's dazzling, she's exciting,
and very, very sexy.

1604
01:45:04.601 --> 01:45:05.643
Thank you, Zack.

1605
01:45:05.725 --> 01:45:06.725
Yes, sir.

1606
01:45:06.809 --> 01:45:09.519
Miss Malone, how did you feel
about the show tonight?

1607
01:45:10.394 --> 01:45:12.728
I just hope I can be
as good as the show.

1608
01:45:12.809 --> 01:45:14.393
You are, my dear.

1609
01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:16.894
You are the show. - Hear, Hear.

1610
01:45:18.599 --> 01:45:20.100
Miss Malone, please.

1611
01:45:20.183 --> 01:45:21.934
Come on, come on, over here, Nomi.

1612
01:45:22.017 --> 01:45:23.560
That's great, Nomi. One more.

1613
01:45:23.643 --> 01:45:24.726
Please, please.

1614
01:45:24.808 --> 01:45:26.725
This way, please. Congratulations.

1615
01:45:29.267 --> 01:45:31.184
Hey, you ready to party?

1616
01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:32.391
Where?

1617
01:45:32.473 --> 01:45:34.474
The Paradiso.
I rented out the bungalows.

1618
01:45:34.557 --> 01:45:36.224
For what? - For you.

1619
01:45:40.181 --> 01:45:41.849
Hurry up. I got a limo waiting.

1620
01:45:41.931 --> 01:45:43.306
I don't have anything to wear.

1621
01:45:43.391 --> 01:45:45.058
Yes, you do!

1622
01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:48.767
Andrew Carver's coming. He saw
the show, thought you were great!

1623
01:45:49.889 --> 01:45:50.931
Did you hear that?

1624
01:45:51.013 --> 01:45:52.848
Andrew Carver is gonna be there!

1625
01:45:52.931 --> 01:45:54.431
Yeah, I heard.

1626
01:45:57.056 --> 01:45:58.890
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1627
01:46:00.765 --> 01:46:02.808
You pushed her, didn't you?

1628
01:46:03.098 --> 01:46:04.140
No.

1629
01:46:05.472 --> 01:46:07.390
How can you talk that shit to me?

1630
01:46:07.473 --> 01:46:08.557
Julie saw it.

1631
01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:09.806
She couldn't have seen it.

1632
01:46:09.889 --> 01:46:13.100
I saw Julie. And her back was to you.

1633
01:46:18.053 --> 01:46:19.428
She saw it.

1634
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.303
Wow, OK.

1635
01:46:27.804 --> 01:46:29.680
Have fun at your party.

1636
01:46:30.386 --> 01:46:33.388
Molly. Molly! Come here, Molly!

1637
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:36.389
You got to come.
Andrew's going to be there.

1638
01:46:36.593 --> 01:46:38.052
I don't care.

1639
01:46:40.511 --> 01:46:41.719
Molly...

1640
01:46:43.844 --> 01:46:45.970
It ain't a party without you.

1641
01:46:46.884 --> 01:46:50.220
Let go of me.

1642
01:46:53.009 --> 01:46:54.320
Miss Malone! Miss Malone!

1643
01:46:54.344 --> 01:46:55.344
One more! This way!

1644
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:05.676
This way, Nomi!

1645
01:47:08.843 --> 01:47:10.510
To the one and only -

1646
01:47:10.592 --> 01:47:11.801
Surprise!

1647
01:47:11.883 --> 01:47:17.638
- beautiful girl in the world!

1648
01:47:24.924 --> 01:47:26.299
One minute.

1649
01:47:31.714 --> 01:47:34.716
Oh, my God.

1650
01:47:35.381 --> 01:47:36.464
So...

1651
01:47:37.964 --> 01:47:39.965
what I want to know is...

1652
01:47:42.213 --> 01:47:43.713
where's Andrew?

1653
01:47:50.295 --> 01:47:51.629
Look.

1654
01:48:03.253 --> 01:48:05.003
I love your outfit.

1655
01:48:05.169 --> 01:48:06.503
Thank you.

1656
01:48:08.253 --> 01:48:09.461
Nomi...

1657
01:48:10.377 --> 01:48:12.962
think I could be your understudy?

1658
01:48:14.337 --> 01:48:16.463
I'll see what I can do, OK?

1659
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.044
Thanks, darlin'.

1660
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:22.586
Hey, Andrew Carver's here.

1661
01:48:22.668 --> 01:48:24.210
Come on. I wanna introduce you.
Let's go.

1662
01:48:24.292 --> 01:48:25.793
Andrew's here!

1663
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:30.836
One more, Andrew! Great.
Andrew, this way!

1664
01:48:30.917 --> 01:48:32.042
Zack. How you doin'?

1665
01:48:35.002 --> 01:48:36.294
Andrew Carver,

1666
01:48:36.377 --> 01:48:37.460
Nomi Malone.

1667
01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:39.503
How you doin'?
You were sensational tonight.

1668
01:48:39.584 --> 01:48:41.544
Thank you. - You're welcome.

1669
01:48:41.626 --> 01:48:42.960
Zachary...

1670
01:48:43.335 --> 01:48:44.836
Wherever did you find her?

1671
01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.043
I'll never tell.

1672
01:48:49.292 --> 01:48:50.334
I like your songs.

1673
01:48:50.417 --> 01:48:51.459
Thank you.

1674
01:48:51.542 --> 01:48:52.917
You know, uh...

1675
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.584
I like your ass.

1676
01:48:54.833 --> 01:48:56.041
Call me.

1677
01:48:59.542 --> 01:49:01.126
Molly Abrams,

1678
01:49:01.332 --> 01:49:02.833
Andrew Carver.

1679
01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:04.250
Hi, Molly.

1680
01:49:04.333 --> 01:49:08.044
Andrew. I can't even
thread a needle anymore.

1681
01:49:09.956 --> 01:49:11.123
Sorry?

1682
01:49:11.249 --> 01:49:13.625
Molly's one of your biggest fans.

1683
01:49:14.123 --> 01:49:16.541
Well, then, let me get you a drink.

1684
01:49:17.206 --> 01:49:18.373
OK.

1685
01:49:18.456 --> 01:49:19.706
Come on.

1686
01:49:23.372 --> 01:49:24.705
Oh, my God.

1687
01:49:26.581 --> 01:49:27.748
Enjoy.

1688
01:49:28.497 --> 01:49:30.540
You look beautiful tonight.

1689
01:49:33.039 --> 01:49:36.625
Should we walk into the wind?

1690
01:49:38.246 --> 01:49:42.374
Maybe fall when autumn falls

1691
01:49:42.995 --> 01:49:46.623
Let's walk into the wind

1692
01:49:49.745 --> 01:49:53.540
You have to learn to touch by touching

1693
01:49:54.702 --> 01:49:58.831
Touch me, touch me, if you dare

1694
01:49:59.202 --> 01:50:03.705
We will reach the end of the beginning

1695
01:50:04.035 --> 01:50:08.122
In this beatnik love affair...

1696
01:50:21.785 --> 01:50:23.369
What's going on?

1697
01:50:26.991 --> 01:50:29.034
Just wanna party, baby.

1698
01:50:30.575 --> 01:50:32.284
Let me go!

1699
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:33.950
Get her!

1700
01:50:35.699 --> 01:50:37.534
Let me go! - Shut the fuck up!

1701
01:50:39.365 --> 01:50:41.116
Aah! - Throw her down!

1702
01:50:44.824 --> 01:50:45.990
Pussy!

1703
01:50:46.865 --> 01:50:48.366
Fuck her, man!

1704
01:50:48.573 --> 01:50:50.991
Fuck her!

1705
01:50:51.365 --> 01:50:52.615
Fuck her! - Let me go!

1706
01:50:52.697 --> 01:50:53.864
Fuck her!

1707
01:50:54.531 --> 01:50:58.534
Maybe fall when autumn falls

1708
01:50:58.988 --> 01:51:02.157
Let's walk into the wind

1709
01:51:03.155 --> 01:51:05.365
I could fall in love with you.

1710
01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:09.658
Take my hand, hold on tight

1711
01:51:10.364 --> 01:51:13.866
I promise you it'll be all right

1712
01:51:24.071 --> 01:51:31.035
Walk into the wind

1713
01:51:34.029 --> 01:51:36.030
Let's get out of here.

1714
01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.654
Molly.

1715
01:51:49.528 --> 01:51:51.278
We have her sedated.

1716
01:51:51.527 --> 01:51:53.027
She's in shock.

1717
01:51:53.818 --> 01:51:57.112
She has a broken nose, vaginal tears.

1718
01:51:57.691 --> 01:52:00.110
She'll be here three or four days.

1719
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:03.568
Zack, Zack.

1720
01:52:30.315 --> 01:52:33.442
Look at this. And look at this.

1721
01:52:33.856 --> 01:52:34.898
Later.

1722
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:36.481
Where are the police?

1723
01:52:36.564 --> 01:52:38.315
They're not here.
- Why the fuck aren't they here?

1724
01:52:38.397 --> 01:52:40.440
Because they're not coming.

1725
01:52:43.687 --> 01:52:45.188
Don't do it.

1726
01:52:45.814 --> 01:52:46.980
Polly.

1727
01:52:54.730 --> 01:52:56.523
How did you find out?

1728
01:52:56.854 --> 01:52:59.731
You were busted for disturbing
the peace at the Crave Club.

1729
01:52:59.813 --> 01:53:02.189
The police took your fingerprints.

1730
01:53:03.187 --> 01:53:04.227
I don't have to listen to this.

1731
01:53:04.269 --> 01:53:05.853
Yes, you do.

1732
01:53:09.353 --> 01:53:11.062
Polly Ann Costello.

1733
01:53:11.436 --> 01:53:14.605
Your father killed your mother,
then killed himself.

1734
01:53:14.686 --> 01:53:17.939
You ran away from a foster home
in Oakland, December 1990.

1735
01:53:18.018 --> 01:53:20.394
Arrests, Denver, soliciting.

1736
01:53:20.477 --> 01:53:22.103
Stop it! - San Jose, soliciting.

1737
01:53:22.186 --> 01:53:24.687
Cheyenne, soliciting. Shall I
read you the rest of them?

1738
01:53:24.768 --> 01:53:26.852
Possession of crack cocaine.

1739
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.436
Assault with a deadly weapon.

1740
01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:32.309
Tell me something.

1741
01:53:32.392 --> 01:53:34.268
Why did you stop hooking?

1742
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:37.852
You had your future pretty well
mapped out for yourself.

1743
01:53:39.517 --> 01:53:41.351
I did what I had to do.

1744
01:53:42.308 --> 01:53:44.518
Just like you did with Cristal.

1745
01:53:47.018 --> 01:53:48.602
I'm not a whore.

1746
01:53:50.892 --> 01:53:51.934
No.

1747
01:53:52.935 --> 01:53:54.310
You're not.

1748
01:53:55.725 --> 01:53:57.935
You're gonna be a big star.

1749
01:53:59.433 --> 01:54:02.310
Your face is gonna be up on billboards.

1750
01:54:02.848 --> 01:54:06.392
And you're gonna make a lot
of money for the Stardust.

1751
01:54:21.679 --> 01:54:24.848
You're not gonna let them
get away with this.

1752
01:54:24.932 --> 01:54:27.600
Andrew Carver is
at the Paradiso this year.

1753
01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:29.431
But he might be
at the Riviera next year

1754
01:54:29.513 --> 01:54:31.806
or the Stardust the year after
that. He's part of the team.

1755
01:54:31.889 --> 01:54:33.264
So are you.

1756
01:54:36.512 --> 01:54:38.179
What about Molly?

1757
01:54:38.721 --> 01:54:40.365
You like her? I'll make sure he
gives her a lot of money.

1758
01:54:40.389 --> 01:54:42.390
She can have a dress shop.

1759
01:54:46.054 --> 01:54:47.721
Tell me something.

1760
01:54:48.929 --> 01:54:50.679
What did you charge?

1761
01:54:52.678 --> 01:54:53.929
Hooking.

1762
01:54:58.844 --> 01:54:59.844
50.

1763
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:01.970
100 sometimes.

1764
01:55:03.552 --> 01:55:05.095
You got low self-esteem, baby.

1765
01:55:05.177 --> 01:55:07.178
You're a fantastic fuck.

1766
01:55:17.343 --> 01:55:19.552
I was paying you a compliment.

1767
01:55:55.005 --> 01:55:56.506
It's showtime.

1768
01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:11.671
Andrew Carver, please.

1769
01:56:19.087 --> 01:56:20.378
Hello, baby. - Hi.

1770
01:56:20.464 --> 01:56:22.090
Lookin' good.

1771
01:56:22.172 --> 01:56:24.090
He's ready for you. - Thank you.

1772
01:56:37.462 --> 01:56:39.254
Didn't take you long.

1773
01:56:40.002 --> 01:56:41.044
No.

1774
01:56:49.169 --> 01:56:51.253
I like you better topless.

1775
01:56:53.085 --> 01:56:55.377
Wait till you see me bottomless.

1776
01:57:00.667 --> 01:57:02.085
I'm waiting.

1777
01:57:37.873 --> 01:57:39.540
Take the rest off.

1778
01:57:41.414 --> 01:57:42.498
Sure.

1779
01:57:50.247 --> 01:57:52.499
You make a sound, I'll fucking kill you!

1780
01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.830
OK, OK, OK.

1781
01:57:59.787 --> 01:58:01.162
Oh, man, no.

1782
01:58:09.913 --> 01:58:11.080
Fucker!

1783
01:58:11.161 --> 01:58:12.411
Fuck off!

1784
01:58:24.202 --> 01:58:26.244
He says he wants to sleep.

1785
01:58:26.327 --> 01:58:27.911
Tired him out, huh?

1786
01:58:27.994 --> 01:58:29.119
Yeah.

1787
01:58:45.866 --> 01:58:48.409
She's still out. It's the medication.

1788
01:58:50.866 --> 01:58:52.283
Is she OK?

1789
01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:53.824
She's OK.

1790
01:59:05.825 --> 01:59:09.244
Molly.

1791
01:59:16.198 --> 01:59:17.990
I just went to Carver.

1792
01:59:19.199 --> 01:59:21.325
I kicked the shit out of him.

1793
01:59:27.239 --> 01:59:28.615
I love you.

1794
01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:42.946
Cristal Connors, please.

1795
01:59:43.029 --> 01:59:44.321
Room 319.

1796
01:59:52.654 --> 01:59:55.364
You know the best advice
I ever gave you?

1797
01:59:56.487 --> 01:59:58.821
If you're the only one
left standing up there...

1798
01:59:58.903 --> 02:00:00.653
They'll hire you.

1799
02:00:02.819 --> 02:00:06.697
Thank you... And good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1800
02:00:06.944 --> 02:00:09.738
Cristal has left the building.

1801
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:13.569
I'm sorry, Cristal.

1802
02:00:13.651 --> 02:00:16.779
Yeah, I know just how sorry you are.

1803
02:00:19.609 --> 02:00:22.152
How do you think I got my first lead?

1804
02:00:25.525 --> 02:00:28.110
There's always someone
younger and hungrier

1805
02:00:28.191 --> 02:00:30.525
coming down the stairs after you.

1806
02:00:32.816 --> 02:00:34.901
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1807
02:00:34.981 --> 02:00:36.648
Oh, hell, darlin'.

1808
02:00:37.025 --> 02:00:38.650
I needed a rest.

1809
02:00:39.317 --> 02:00:42.778
Besides my lawyers got me
a real nice settlement.

1810
02:00:46.816 --> 02:00:48.067
I gotta go.

1811
02:00:48.148 --> 02:00:51.442
Aren't you going to come here
and give me a big kiss?

1812
02:01:29.478 --> 02:01:40.478
Bye, darlin'. - Bye, darlin'.

1813
02:02:02.059 --> 02:02:03.684
Come on! Hurry up!

1814
02:02:11.768 --> 02:02:13.310
Hop in, pard.

1815
02:02:13.767 --> 02:02:15.893
This here's your lucky day.

1816
02:02:17.850 --> 02:02:19.100
Right.

1817
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:23.223
Let's go.

1818
02:02:30.266 --> 02:02:31.933
So did you gamble?

1819
02:02:34.724 --> 02:02:36.141
Did you win?

1820
02:02:40.306 --> 02:02:41.848
What'd you win?

1821
02:02:46.681 --> 02:02:47.806
Me.

1822
02:02:48.805 --> 02:02:50.056
Oh, fuck.

1823
02:02:50.972 --> 02:02:52.222
It's you.

1824
02:02:52.846 --> 02:02:55.765
I want my fucking suitcase,

1825
02:02:55.846 --> 02:02:56.888
asshole!

1826
02:02:56.972 --> 02:03:00.391
Hey! Wait a minute! I'm driving
here! Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1827
02:03:00.472 --> 02:03:01.555
Watch the fuckin' road!

1828
02:03:01.637 --> 02:03:03.055
Be cool, be cool.

1829
02:03:03.138 --> 02:03:05.514
I'll get your suitcase.
Mellow out, all right?

1830
02:03:05.595 --> 02:03:10.390
Hello, I'm coming in my new skin

1831
02:03:18.095 --> 02:03:19.888
Hello, hello

1832
02:03:19.969 --> 02:03:24.806
I'm hungry for some new skin

1833
02:03:32.593 --> 02:03:34.260
Hello, it's me

1834
02:03:34.342 --> 02:03:39.055
I'm coming for you in my new skin

1835
02:08:09.155 --> 02:08:10.822
I woke up

1836
02:08:11.404 --> 02:08:12.946
Wanting you

1837
02:08:13.569 --> 02:08:16.988
But you are rarely there

1838
02:08:18.236 --> 02:08:22.406
I howl a song, and I prowl and long

1839
02:08:22.903 --> 02:08:25.780
I drown, but you don't care

1840
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:30.654
I can't get anything done

1841
02:08:31.236 --> 02:08:34.864
With you shakin' around like that

1842
02:08:36.610 --> 02:08:39.446
I can't take it off for fun

1843
02:08:40.401 --> 02:08:44.029
With that animal on your back

1844
02:08:45.650 --> 02:08:48.777
I can't get anything done

1845
02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:53.028
With you shakin' around like that

1846
02:08:54.608 --> 02:08:57.736
I can't take it off for fun

1847
02:08:58.608 --> 02:09:02.111
With that animal on your back

1848
02:09:03.773 --> 02:09:05.149
Animal!

1849
02:09:11.232 --> 02:09:13.191
Do you like that?

1850
02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:18.608
How about this? You like this?

1851
02:09:29.982 --> 02:09:31.232
Animal

1852
02:09:36.605 --> 02:09:38.857
Our naked history

1853
02:09:40.023 --> 02:09:43.108
Shattered in a bad rap

1854
02:09:44.604 --> 02:09:46.939
But those days, decades

1855
02:09:47.147 --> 02:09:49.648
Dollars and centuries

1856
02:09:49.896 --> 02:09:52.189
It's a tail in a trap

1857
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:58.273
You really don't know, do ya?

1858
02:09:58.478 --> 02:10:01.605
Your scent is all I need

1859
02:10:02.729 --> 02:10:05.814
To bring out the savage in me

1860
02:10:07.269 --> 02:10:10.479
Your scent is all I need

1861
02:10:11.686 --> 02:10:15.147
To bring out the animal in me

1862
02:10:16.603 --> 02:10:19.272
I can't get anything done

1863
02:10:20.309 --> 02:10:23.854
With you shakin' around like that

1864
02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:28.436
I can't take it off for fun

1865
02:10:29.393 --> 02:10:33.146
With that animal on your back

1866
02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:41.600
Animal! Animal!
