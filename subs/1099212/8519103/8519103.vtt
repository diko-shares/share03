1
00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:24.275
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

2
00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:38.998
But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.

3
00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:14.533
So I can't bring myself to regret
the decision to leave home.

4
00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.079
I would miss Phoenix.

5
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.999
I'd miss the heat.

6
00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:28.422
I would miss my loving,
erratic, harebrained mother.

7
00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:29.674
Okay.

8
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.693
- Renee, come on.
- And her new husband.

9
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.263
Guys, come on. I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.

10
00:01:35.346 --> 00:01:37.515
But they want to go on the road,

11
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.934
so I'm gonna spend
some time with my dad,

12
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:43.104
and this will be a good thing.

13
00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.606
I think.

14
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.468
In the state of Washington,

15
00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:17.471
under a near constant cover
of clouds and rain,

16
00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:19.974
there's a small town named Forks.

17
00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:24.895
Population, 3,120 people.

18
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.398
This is where I'm moving.

19
00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.277
My dadâ€™s Charlie.

20
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.363
He's the chief of police.

21
00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.583
Your hair's longer.

22
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:50.421
I cut it since the last time I saw you.

23
00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.090
Oh.

24
00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:55.885
Guess it grew out again.

25
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:08.397
I used to spend two weeks here almost
every summer,

26
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:09.982
but it's been years.

27
00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:27.375
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.

28
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:28.959
Oh, right. One bathroom.

29
00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:37.343
It's a pretty good work lamp.

30
00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:41.931
The sales lady picked out
the bed stuff.

31
00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:44.558
You like-- you like purple, right?

32
00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:47.686
Purple's cool. Thanks.

33
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.945
Okay.

34
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.077
One of the best things about Charlie?

35
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.538
He doesn't hover.

36
00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:15.384
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.

37
00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:16.715
Good to see you.

38
00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:21.804
- Bella, you remember Billy Black.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.224
- Wow, you're looking good.
- Well, I'm still dancing.

40
00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.934
I'm glad you're finally here.

41
00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.857
Charlie here hasn't shut up about it
since you told him you were coming.

42
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.749
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.

43
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.276
After I ram you in the ankles.

44
00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.570
- You want to go?
- Yeah. Bring it.

45
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.282
- Hi, I'm-- I'm Jacob.
- Hey.

46
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:44.118
We, uh, we used to make mud pies
when we were little.

47
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.203
Right. No, I remember.

48
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:49.790
Are they always like this?

49
00:04:49.874 --> 00:04:52.710
- It's getting worse with old age.
- Good.

50
00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:56.213
- So, what do you think?
- Of what?

51
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.592
- Your homecoming present.
- This?

52
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:03.262
- Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.

53
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.890
- I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
- Oh, God! Come on!

54
00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:10.936
Oh, my gosh! This is perfect.
Are you joking me?

55
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.313
Sorry.

56
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:18.110
I told you she'd love it.
I'm down with the kids.

57
00:05:18.194 --> 00:05:19.904
Oh, yeah, dude.
You're the bomb.

58
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.656
Okay. Uh...

59
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.885
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,

60
00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.077
but besides that,
you should be good.

61
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.371
- That's this one?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.

62
00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:31.707
All right.

63
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.792
Do you want a ride to school
or something?

64
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.128
I go to school on the reservation.

65
00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:38.339
- Oh, right, right.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.662
That's too bad. It would've been nice
to know one person.

67
00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:50.017
My first day at a new school.

68
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.603
It's March, middle of the semester.

69
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:54.772
Great.

70
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:04.573
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

71
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:07.159
Good one.

72
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:15.918
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.

73
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:21.090
Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears
of this place. Anything you need.

74
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:23.926
Tour guide, lunch date,
shoulder to cry on?

75
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:31.725
Uh... I'm really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.

76
00:06:32.768 --> 00:06:33.828
Good headline for your feature.

77
00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.522
I'm on the paper, and you're news,
baby, front page.

78
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:38.274
No, I'm not.

79
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:40.317
You...

80
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:44.905
- Please don't have any sort of...
- Whoa, whoa! Chillax. No feature.

81
00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:46.532
- Okay, thanks.
- Cool?

82
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.325
All right. Okay. Yeah.

83
00:06:52.663 --> 00:06:54.331
Get it! Get it! Get it!

84
00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.084
To you!

85
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.711
Whoa!

86
00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:01.922
I'm sorry.
I told them not to let me play.

87
00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:04.925
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...

88
00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.011
You're Isabella, right?

89
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:08.971
Just Bella.

90
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.432
Yeah. Hey, I'm Mike Newton.

91
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:13.642
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

92
00:07:13.726 --> 00:07:15.978
- She's got a great spike, huh?
- Yeah, it's...

93
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.438
I'm Jessica, by the way.

94
00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:21.191
- Hey, you're from Arizona, right?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:24.361
Aren't people from Arizona
supposed to be, like, really tan?

96
00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:28.449
Yeah. Maybe that's why
they kicked me out.

97
00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:36.123
- You're good.
- That's so funny.

98
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:42.212
- Back in, Jess.
- Down here.

99
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:44.381
Like a masterpiece, you know,

100
00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.625
we'll have, like, this crazy pyramid fall
from the sky,

101
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.653
- and then you guys can...
- It's my pleasure, Madame.

102
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.864
- You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?

103
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:52.890
Hey, Mikey! You met
my home girl, Bella?

104
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:54.892
Hey. Your home girl?

105
00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:55.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

106
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.187
- That's...
- My girl.

107
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.789
Sorry I had to mess
up your game, Mike!

108
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.814
Tyler.

109
00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:02.691
Yes!

110
00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:05.277
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:09.698
It's like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.

112
00:08:09.782 --> 00:08:11.367
Smile.

113
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.701
- Okay.
- Sorry.

114
00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:14.161
I needed a candid for the feature.

115
00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.998
The feature's dead, Angela.
Don't bring it up again.

116
00:08:18.082 --> 00:08:21.293
- It's okay, I just...
- I got your back, baby.

117
00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:24.797
Guess we'll just run another editorial
on teen drinking.

118
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.884
You know, you can always go
for eating disorders.

119
00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:32.179
Speedo padding on the swim team.

120
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.931
Actually, that's a good one.

121
00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.099
- Kirk. Right?
- Yeah!

122
00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:36.382
That's exactly what I thought.

123
00:08:37.393 --> 00:08:39.520
We're talking Olympic-size.

124
00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:41.723
There's no way.
He's so skinny. It doesn't make sense.

125
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:43.816
- Totally.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:49.029
- Who are they?
- The Cullens.

127
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:54.243
They're Dr. and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids.

128
00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:57.871
They moved down here from Alaska,
like, a few years ago.

129
00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:02.167
- They kind of keep to themselves.
- Yeah, 'cause they're all together.

130
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.545
Like, together, together.

131
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.383
The blonde girl, that's Rosalie,

132
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:13.053
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.

133
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:14.638
I'm not even sure that's legal.

134
00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:17.057
Jess, they're not actually related.

135
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:19.810
Yeah, but they live together. It's weird.

136
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:25.441
And, okay, the little dark-haired girl's
Alice, she's really weird,

137
00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:29.611
and she's with Jasper,
the blond one who looks like he's in pain.

138
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:38.495
Dr. Cullen's like this
foster dad/matchmaker.

139
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.122
Maybe he'll adopt me.

140
00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:42.583
Who's he?

141
00:09:49.465 --> 00:09:51.175
That's Edward Cullen.

142
00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.927
He's totally gorgeous, obviously,

143
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:56.472
but apparently nobody here's
good enough for him.

144
00:09:58.307 --> 00:09:59.975
Like I care, you know?

145
00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.103
So, yeah.

146
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.735
- Seriously, like, don't waste your time.
- I wasn't planning on it.

147
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:22.372
- Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.

148
00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:26.001
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.

149
00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.643
Hi. Can I have the pass?
Thank you.

150
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.062
Welcome to the class. Here.
Here's your stuff, okay?

151
00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.815
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.

152
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:50.192
The last one. Just follow along
till you catch up.

153
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:54.363
All right, guys, today we are gonna be
observing the behavior of planaria,

154
00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.282
aka flatworms.

155
00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:58.826
So what we're gonna do...

156
00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:07.209
...regenerate.
Zombie worms.

157
00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.587
No cell phones.
Guys, let's get to it.

158
00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:14.716
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.

159
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.554
Please just don't cut here.
We don't cut here.

160
00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:21.014
You won't believe this.

161
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:23.600
Let's try to focus while we check
those out, huh, guys?

162
00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:36.989
There must be
something open.

163
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:41.034
- Physics? Biochem?
- No, every class is full.

164
00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:42.411
Just a minute, dear.

165
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.163
I'm afraid you'll
have to stay in biology.

166
00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:50.043
Fine. Just...
I'll just have to endure it.

167
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.061
I just can't get over
how grown up you are.

168
00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.397
And so gorgeous.

169
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.650
Hey, Bella.
You remember me?

170
00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:17.571
I played Santa one year.

171
00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.782
Yeah, Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas
here since she was four.

172
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:22.993
I bet I made an impression,
though, didn't I?

173
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.329
- You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?

174
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.165
Hey, kids love those
little bottles, though.

175
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.460
All right, let the girl eat
her garden burger, Waylon.

176
00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.962
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.

177
00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:35.881
Berry cobbler, remember?

178
00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:39.051
Your dad still has it.
Every Thursday.

179
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.969
Thank you.
That'd be great.

180
00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:48.685
- Here.
- Thanks.

181
00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:59.237
Hey, baby. So, listen,

182
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:01.782
if spring training goes well, we could be
moving to Florida.

183
00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:04.952
Please insert $1.25
for an additional three minutes.

184
00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:06.370
Mom, where's your cell?

185
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:10.540
Okay, don't laugh. I didn't lose
my power cord, it ran away.

186
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:12.209
Screaming.

187
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.962
I literally repel technology now.

188
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.421
I miss you.

189
00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.882
Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

190
00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:21.677
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?

191
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.305
Are there any cute guys?
Are they being nice to you?

192
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.349
Well...

193
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.853
- they're all very welcoming.
- Uh-oh.

194
00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:33.397
Tell me all about it.

195
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.817
- It doesn't even matter.
- Yes, it does, honey.

196
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.737
I have homework to do.
I'll talk to you later.

197
00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.197
Okay. I love you.

198
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.365
Love you, too.

199
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:57.504
I planned to confront him and demand
to know what his problem was.

200
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.682
But he never showed.

201
00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:15.230
Bella!

202
00:14:29.453 --> 00:14:32.998
And the next day,
another no-show.

203
00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.005
More days passed.

204
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:43.592
Things were getting
a little strange.

205
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.184
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

206
00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:37.104
Ice doesn't really help
the uncoordinated.

207
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:40.816
Yeah. That's why I had some new tires
put on the truck.

208
00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:43.443
Old ones were getting pretty bald.

209
00:15:43.527 --> 00:15:46.738
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.

210
00:15:46.822 --> 00:15:50.200
Security guard at the Grisham Mill
got killed by some kind of animal.

211
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:52.702
An animal?

212
00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:56.164
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.

213
00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.459
Anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand.

214
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:01.545
- Be careful.
- Always am.

215
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:05.966
- And thanks for the tires.
- Yeah.

216
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:23.900
Prom Committee
is a chick thing,

217
00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.735
but I gotta cover it
for the paper anyway,

218
00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.655
and they need a guy to help choose
the music, so I need your playlist.

219
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:33.285
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...

220
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.078
What's up, Arizona? Huh?

221
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.248
How you liking the rain, girl?
Better get used to it, girl.

222
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:42.169
- Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.
- Oh, I know...

223
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.336
That was really awesome.

224
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.672
Why you shooting down
my game? Let a play a play.

225
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.258
Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?

226
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.311
Hello.

227
00:17:00.312 --> 00:17:04.357
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself last week.

228
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.026
I'm Edward Cullen.

229
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.694
You're Bella?

230
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.405
Yes.

231
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.742
Onion root tip cells, that's what's
on your slides right now.

232
00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:18.038
Okay? So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,

233
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:23.627
and the first partners that get it right
are gonna win the Golden Onion.

234
00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.505
All right, good.

235
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.091
Ladies first.

236
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.431
You were gone.

237
00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:43.188
Yeah. I was out of town for a couple
of days. Personal reasons.

238
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.149
Prophase.

239
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.319
Do you mind if I look?

240
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.951
It's prophase.

241
00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.953
Like I said.

242
00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.002
So are you enjoying the rain?

243
00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.548
What?

244
00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.634
You're asking me about the weather?

245
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:16.012
Yeah, I... I guess I am.

246
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.768
Well, I don't really like the rain.

247
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.232
Any cold, wet thing, I don't really...

248
00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.113
What?

249
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.115
Nothing.

250
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.036
It's an a phase.

251
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.248
- You mind if I check?
- Sure.

252
00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.633
Anaphase.

253
00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.176
Like I said.

254
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.141
If you hate the cold
and the rain so much,

255
00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:04.227
why'd you move to the wettest place
in the continental US?

256
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.819
It's complicated.

257
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.447
I'm sure I can keep up.

258
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.120
My mom remarried, and...

259
00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.958
So you don't like the guy, or...?

260
00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:28.835
No, that's not...

261
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:32.714
Phil's really nice.

262
00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.938
It's met a phase.
You want to check it?

263
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.816
I believe you.

264
00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.236
Why didn't you move
with your mother and Phil?

265
00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:04.746
Well, Phil's a minor league baseball
player, and he travels a lot,

266
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.208
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,

267
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:13.213
so I figured I'd stay
with my dad for a while.

268
00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:16.091
And now you're unhappy?

269
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.593
No.

270
00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:22.180
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm just trying to figure you out.

271
00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:25.600
You're very difficult for me to read.

272
00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:27.394
Hey, did you get contacts?

273
00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.813
No.

274
00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.024
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,

275
00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:37.070
and now they're, like, golden brown.

276
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:41.533
Yeah, I know, it's the...
It's the fluorescents.

277
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.756
- Bella!
- Bella!

278
00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.759
- Dial 911!
- I already called.

279
00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.279
They're gonna send
somebody over soon.

280
00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.263
Bella, I'm so sorry. I panicked.

281
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.225
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.

282
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:58.443
Bella. You okay?

283
00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.086
You and I are gonna talk.
You all right?

284
00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:01.779
I'm fine, Dad. Calm down.

285
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:04.365
I'm sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.

286
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:05.533
I know. It's okay.

287
00:22:05.617 --> 00:22:08.369
No. It sure as hell is not okay.

288
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:09.537
Dad, it wasn't his fault.

289
00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.664
You could've been killed.
You understand that?

290
00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:14.000
Yes. But I wasn't, so...

291
00:22:15.001 --> 00:22:16.503
You can kiss your license goodbye.

292
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.790
- I heard the chief's daughter was here.
- Dr. Cullen.

293
00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:22.133
Charlie.

294
00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:23.676
I've got this one, Jackie.

295
00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:27.889
- Isabella.
- Bella.

296
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.768
Well, Bella, looks like you took
quite a spill. How do you feel?

297
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:32.852
Good.

298
00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:35.230
Look here.

299
00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:40.235
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,

300
00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:42.195
but your vitals look good.

301
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:45.990
No signs of any head trauma.
I think you'll be just fine.

302
00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.909
I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really...

303
00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:53.557
You know, it would've been a whole lot
worse if Edward wasn't there.

304
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.833
He knocked me out of the way.

305
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.961
Edward? Your boy?

306
00:22:58.044 --> 00:22:59.754
Yeah, it was amazing.

307
00:22:59.837 --> 00:23:02.882
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.

308
00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:04.634
Sounds like you were very lucky.

309
00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.261
Charlie.

310
00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:12.684
I gotta go sigh some paperwork.
You should...

311
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.688
You should probably call your mom.

312
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.356
Did you tell her?

313
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:25.321
She's probably just freaking out.

314
00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:28.575
...fifteen kids that saw what happened.

315
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:31.202
What was I supposed
to do, then? Let her die?

316
00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:33.997
This isn't just about you.
It's about all of us.

317
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.790
I think we should take this in my office.

318
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.770
Can I talk to you for a minute?

319
00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.504
Rosalie.

320
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:49.012
What?

321
00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:55.059
How did you get over to me so fast?

322
00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.811
I was standing right next to you, Bella.

323
00:23:57.812 --> 00:24:01.524
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.

324
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.276
No, I wasn't.

325
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:09.324
Yes, you were.

326
00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:13.911
Bella, you're-- You hit your head.
I think you're confused.

327
00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:15.788
I know what I saw.

328
00:24:15.872 --> 00:24:17.915
And what exactly was that?

329
00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.335
You...

330
00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:24.672
You stopped the van.

331
00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:26.966
You pushed it away with your hand.

332
00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:30.303
Well, nobody's
gonna believe you, so...

333
00:24:32.388 --> 00:24:37.644
I wasn't gonna tell anybody.
I just need to know the truth.

334
00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:41.856
Can't you just thank me
and get over it?

335
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.483
Thank you.

336
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:46.701
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.

337
00:24:47.695 --> 00:24:49.739
Well, then I hope you
enjoy disappointment.

338
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:27.735
And that was the first night
I dreamt of Edward Cullen.

339
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:32.824
I need everybody's
permission slips, okay?

340
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:34.659
- Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.

341
00:25:34.742 --> 00:25:38.371
Guys, let's go.
Come on, get in. In. Let's go!

342
00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:54.846
Look at you, huh?
You're alive!

343
00:25:54.929 --> 00:25:57.473
- I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.

344
00:25:57.557 --> 00:26:01.519
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,

345
00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:03.271
it's like a month away, but...

346
00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:08.776
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

347
00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.656
So, what do you think?

348
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.283
About what?

349
00:26:15.366 --> 00:26:20.246
Do you want to go?
To prom?

350
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:21.831
With me?

351
00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:26.335
Oh, I... Prom.

352
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:29.505
Dancing.

353
00:26:29.589 --> 00:26:33.426
Not such a good idea for me.

354
00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:35.845
I have something
that weekend anyway.

355
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.972
I'm going to Jacksonville
that weekend.

356
00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:41.309
- You can't go another weekend??
- Non-refundable ticket.

357
00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:45.938
You should ask Jessica.
I know she wants to go with you.

358
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:48.649
All right. All right.

359
00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.277
Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, guys, come on.

360
00:26:52.278 --> 00:26:53.654
We gotta go. We gotta go.

361
00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:55.448
Green is what? Good.

362
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:57.408
Let's go. Guys, come on.

363
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.078
Other bus, other bus.
Let's go.

364
00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:02.663
Eggshells, carrot tops.

365
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:05.416
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.

366
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.019
- Yes, sir. Yes, Sir.
- Very good, very good.

367
00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:12.673
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup of
compost tea.

368
00:27:12.757 --> 00:27:13.841
- Okay.
- Give me that.

369
00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:17.804
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.

370
00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:21.098
Don't drink it!
It's for the plants.

371
00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:22.517
What's in Jacksonville?

372
00:27:25.228 --> 00:27:26.771
How do you know about that?

373
00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:30.900
You didn't answer my question.

374
00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:33.736
You don't answer any of mine, so...

375
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.446
I mean, you don't even say hi to me.

376
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:37.865
Hi.

377
00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:42.328
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?

378
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:45.790
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.

379
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:48.668
It's very common.
You can Google it.

380
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.508
Floridians.
That's what's in Jacksonville.

381
00:27:57.051 --> 00:27:58.928
Can you at least
watch where you walk?

382
00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:06.561
Look, I'm sorry I'm being rude all
the time. I just think it's the best way.

383
00:28:06.644 --> 00:28:09.814
Bella! Guess who
just asked me to prom?

384
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:11.649
Who?

385
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:16.696
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.

386
00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:19.949
- It's not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.

387
00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.872
- You guys are great together.
- I know, right?

388
00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:24.912
- Tyler...
- Gross.

389
00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:28.791
Bella, look, it's a worm.
It's a worm.

390
00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:35.256
Bella, we shouldn't be friends.

391
00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:40.136
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.

392
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.574
I mean, why didn't you
just let the van crush me

393
00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:45.725
and save yourself all this regret?

394
00:28:48.144 --> 00:28:49.979
What, you think I regret saving you?

395
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:53.566
I can see that you do.
I just... I don't know why.

396
00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:57.194
You don't know anything.

397
00:28:57.278 --> 00:29:00.114
Hi. Are you gonna be riding with us?

398
00:29:00.197 --> 00:29:01.908
No, our bus is full.

399
00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:14.253
Your mom called. Again.

400
00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:17.089
Well, that's your fault.

401
00:29:17.173 --> 00:29:19.860
You shouldn't have told her about
the "almost" accident. You finished?

402
00:29:19.884 --> 00:29:21.761
Yeah.

403
00:29:21.844 --> 00:29:24.324
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.

404
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:28.643
She seems different.

405
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.312
- She seems happy.
- Hmm.

406
00:29:35.066 --> 00:29:36.525
Phil sounds like an all right guy.

407
00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:40.905
Yeah, he is.

408
00:29:47.495 --> 00:29:48.537
All right.

409
00:29:48.746 --> 00:29:50.247
No, you need the mitts.
You need them.

410
00:29:51.832 --> 00:29:54.210
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.

411
00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:56.253
- You're gonna get frostbite!
- I don't even know.

412
00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:02.176
Yeah. Hey!

413
00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:03.886
La Push, baby. You in?

414
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.072
Should I know what that means?

415
00:30:05.096 --> 00:30:07.616
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.

416
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.951
Yeah, there's a big swell coming in.

417
00:30:08.975 --> 00:30:10.893
And I don't just surf the Internet.

418
00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:13.229
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.

419
00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.481
But there's whale watching, too.
Come with us.

420
00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:18.985
La Push, baby. It's La Push.

421
00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:21.278
Okay, I'll go if you
stop saying that, okay?

422
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:22.905
Seriously, dude.
It's creepy, man.

423
00:30:22.989 --> 00:30:24.341
- What? That's what it's called.
- So...

424
00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:25.741
Edible art?

425
00:30:29.203 --> 00:30:30.204
Bella.

426
00:30:31.706 --> 00:30:32.915
Thanks.

427
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:35.835
You know, your mood swings are
kind of giving me whiplash.

428
00:30:38.546 --> 00:30:41.191
I only said it'd be better if we weren't
friends, not that I didn't wanna be.

429
00:30:41.215 --> 00:30:42.800
What does that mean?

430
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.430
It means if you were smart,
you'd stay away from me.

431
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:51.600
Okay, well, let's say, for argument's
sake, that I'm not smart.

432
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:53.894
- Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.

433
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.189
I'd rather hear your theories.

434
00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:05.364
I have considered radioactive spiders
and Kryptonite.

435
00:31:07.408 --> 00:31:09.785
That's all superhero stuff, right?

436
00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:13.539
What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?

437
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:18.252
You're not. I can see
what you're trying to put off,

438
00:31:18.335 --> 00:31:21.630
but I can see that it's just to keep
people away from you. It's a mask.

439
00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:30.014
Why don't we just hang out?

440
00:31:32.183 --> 00:31:34.894
Everybody's going to the beach. Come.

441
00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:39.899
I mean, have fun.

442
00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:45.279
- Which beach?
- La Push.

443
00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.281
I don't know. I just...

444
00:31:49.492 --> 00:31:51.994
Is there something wrong
with that beach?

445
00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:56.457
It's just a little crowded.

446
00:32:02.338 --> 00:32:04.507
- Hey, it's freezing.
- I'm paddling out, Coates.

447
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.445
- I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.

448
00:32:08.469 --> 00:32:10.262
- I'm at least paddling out.
- Yeah.

449
00:32:10.346 --> 00:32:11.889
- She's right.
- You guys are babies.

450
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:15.559
So, I keep thinking that Eric's gonna ask
me to the prom,

451
00:32:15.643 --> 00:32:18.187
and then he just doesn't.

452
00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:22.149
You should ask him.

453
00:32:23.734 --> 00:32:27.571
Take control. You're a strong,
independent woman.

454
00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:30.699
- I am?
- Yes.

455
00:32:30.783 --> 00:32:32.535
- Hey, will you do me up?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.914
- Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.

457
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:38.642
- Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?

458
00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:39.792
- Hi.
- Hi.

459
00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:45.339
- What are you, like, stalking me?
- You're on my rez, remember?

460
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.926
Are you surfing?

461
00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:50.845
- Definitely not.
- Thanks.

462
00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:53.556
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.

463
00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:56.225
- What date?
- She invited Edward.

464
00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.018
To be polite, that's it.

465
00:32:58.102 --> 00:33:00.563
I think it's nice she invited him.
Nobody ever does.

466
00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:03.899
- Yeah, 'cause Cullen's a freak.
- You got that right.

467
00:33:03.983 --> 00:33:05.901
You guys know him?

468
00:33:05.985 --> 00:33:08.070
The Cullens don't come here.

469
00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:20.958
What did your friends mean about, you
know, "The Cullens don't come here?"

470
00:33:21.041 --> 00:33:23.210
You caught that, huh?

471
00:33:24.795 --> 00:33:28.799
I'm not really supposed
to say anything about it.

472
00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:31.594
Hey, I can keep a secret.

473
00:33:33.012 --> 00:33:36.098
Really, it's just like an old scary story.

474
00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:40.352
Well, I want to know.

475
00:33:43.314 --> 00:33:48.444
Okay, did you know Quileutes are
supposedly descended from wolves?

476
00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:50.905
What? Like, wolves?

477
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:52.068
- Yeah.
- Like, real wolves?

478
00:33:53.032 --> 00:33:56.493
Well, that's the legend of our tribe.

479
00:33:56.577 --> 00:33:57.745
Okay.

480
00:33:57.828 --> 00:33:59.455
So what's the story
about the Cullens?

481
00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:06.003
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like, enemy clan.

482
00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:13.135
My great grandfather, the chief,
found them hunting on our land.

483
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:16.722
But they claimed to be
something different,

484
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:19.058
SO we made a treaty with them.

485
00:34:19.141 --> 00:34:22.186
If they promised to stay
off Quileute lands,

486
00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:26.523
then we wouldn't expose
what they really were to the palefaces.

487
00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:29.109
I thought they just moved here.

488
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:32.363
Or just moved back.

489
00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:34.740
Right.

490
00:34:34.823 --> 00:34:38.452
It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!

491
00:34:40.162 --> 00:34:44.083
- Well, what are they really?
- It's just a story, Bella.

492
00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:47.044
Come on, let's go.

493
00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:53.133
A shake!

494
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.560
My mama said I didn't know
how to make a kitty meow.

495
00:35:10.818 --> 00:35:12.069
Hello?

496
00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:20.119
Gerald?

497
00:35:21.578 --> 00:35:22.746
Gerald?

498
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.100
Hello.

499
00:35:44.435 --> 00:35:46.353
Nice jacket.

500
00:35:49.023 --> 00:35:50.149
Who are you?

501
00:35:50.232 --> 00:35:53.110
It's always the same
inane questions.

502
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:54.403
"Who are you?"

503
00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:55.946
"What do you want?"

504
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:58.824
"Why are you doing this?"

505
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:03.078
James, let's not play
with our food.

506
00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:53.253
He's not here.

507
00:36:55.798 --> 00:36:58.175
Whenever the weather's nice,
the Cullens disappear.

508
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:01.345
What, do they just ditch?

509
00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:06.100
No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank them out for,
like, hiking and camping and stuff.

510
00:37:06.183 --> 00:37:08.352
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.

511
00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:11.230
Guys, I'm going to the prom with Eric.

512
00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:15.025
- I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.

513
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:17.528
Are you sure you
have to go out of town?

514
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:20.197
Oh, yeah, it's a little family thing.

515
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.674
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles

516
00:37:21.698 --> 00:37:23.575
before all the good dresses
get cleaned out.

517
00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:30.165
Port Angeles?
You mind if I come?

518
00:37:30.249 --> 00:37:32.709
Yeah, I need your opinion.

519
00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.004
- I like this one.
- That's cool.

520
00:37:36.088 --> 00:37:38.465
But, like, I don't know about
the one-shoulder thing.

521
00:37:38.549 --> 00:37:40.026
- I like this one.
- Yeah. I like the beading,

522
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:42.445
- and you wouldn't need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?

523
00:37:42.469 --> 00:37:44.269
- Is that good? Is that my color?
- I like it.

524
00:37:44.346 --> 00:37:46.348
I liked that dusty rose one, too.

525
00:37:46.432 --> 00:37:49.393
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.

526
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:50.602
- Hey.
- Right?

527
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.438
Nice.

528
00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:53.856
Oh, God.

529
00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:56.316
- That is uncomfortable.
- Oh, it's disgusting.

530
00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:02.823
- Bella, what do you think? Yes?
- Looks great.

531
00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:05.868
You said that about,
like, the last five dresses, though.

532
00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:09.955
- I thought they were all pretty good.
- You're not really into this, are you?

533
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:14.418
I actually really just want to go
to this bookstore.

534
00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:16.670
- I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?
- Are you sure?

535
00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:18.797
Yeah, yeah.
I'll see you in a minute.

536
00:38:18.881 --> 00:38:20.257
- Okay.
- Okay.

537
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:24.219
She's right, though.
This looks awesome.

538
00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:28.265
There you go.

539
00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.561
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

540
00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:08.722
- Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?

541
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:09.973
There she is.

542
00:39:10.057 --> 00:39:11.892
- What's up?
- It's my girl.

543
00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:13.703
- How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.

544
00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:16.563
What's up, girl? Hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going?

545
00:39:16.647 --> 00:39:18.732
Where are you going?
Come get a drink with us.

546
00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:20.460
- Yeah, you should hang out with us.
- Come on.

547
00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:21.485
It's fun.

548
00:39:21.568 --> 00:39:23.046
- What's the problem?
- She doesn't like that, man.

549
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.446
- You're pretty.
- Don't touch me.

550
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.406
- Cute.
- Really, no. Seriously, you should.

551
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.991
Don't touch me.

552
00:39:35.958 --> 00:39:36.959
Get in the car.

553
00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:41.838
That was a very dangerous maneuver.

554
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.285
I should go back there
and rip those guys' heads off.

555
00:40:11.368 --> 00:40:12.369
No, you shouldn't.

556
00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:15.289
You don't know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.

557
00:40:15.372 --> 00:40:16.373
And you do?

558
00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:18.667
It's not hard to guess.

559
00:40:20.794 --> 00:40:23.922
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me, so I won't turn around.

560
00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:27.745
You should put your seat belt on.

561
00:40:29.678 --> 00:40:32.347
You should put your seat belt on.

562
00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:40.123
- I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys, I'm sorry. I just...

563
00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:41.690
Where were you?
We left you messages.

564
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:46.236
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like,
starving, so we...

565
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.739
I'm sorry I kept Bella from dinner.

566
00:40:48.822 --> 00:40:51.950
We just sort of ran into each other
and got talking.

567
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:54.786
- Yeah.

568
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.206
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?

569
00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:01.579
- Yeah, we were--
- Yeah, we were just leaving. So...

570
00:41:01.627 --> 00:41:04.463
- Let's get this...
- Bella, if you wanna...

571
00:41:05.672 --> 00:41:09.551
I think I should make sure Bella gets
something to eat. If you'd like.

572
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:14.264
I'll drive you home myself.

573
00:41:14.348 --> 00:41:16.683
That's so thoughtful.

574
00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:19.394
It's really thoughtful. Yeah.

575
00:41:19.478 --> 00:41:22.939
- Yeah. I should eat something.
- Yeah.

576
00:41:24.232 --> 00:41:26.777
- Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.

577
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.363
- See ya.
- Okay.

578
00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:42.709
All right, one mushroom ravioli.

579
00:41:42.793 --> 00:41:46.046
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

580
00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:48.423
So are you sure there isn't anything
I can get for you?

581
00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:49.841
No. No, thank you.

582
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:51.968
Let me know.

583
00:41:58.767 --> 00:42:00.435
You're really not gonna eat?

584
00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:05.941
No, I'm on a special diet.

585
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:09.861
You gotta give me some answers.

586
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:13.699
Yes, no.

587
00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:16.702
To get to the other side.

588
00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:18.620
1.77245...

589
00:42:18.704 --> 00:42:20.831
I don't want to know
what the square root of pi is.

590
00:42:20.914 --> 00:42:22.249
You knew that?

591
00:42:22.332 --> 00:42:24.793
How did you know where I was?

592
00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:26.628
I didn't.

593
00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:29.631
- All right.
- What?

594
00:42:29.715 --> 00:42:31.216
Don't leave. I--

595
00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:37.431
Did you follow me?

596
00:42:38.932 --> 00:42:44.896
... I feel very protective of you.

597
00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:48.900
So you followed me.

598
00:42:48.984 --> 00:42:51.987
I was trying to keep a distance
unless you needed my help,

599
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:56.199
and then I heard what those lowlifes
were thinking.

600
00:42:56.283 --> 00:43:00.537
Wait. You say you heard
what they were thinking?

601
00:43:03.707 --> 00:43:05.584
So what, you...

602
00:43:07.127 --> 00:43:08.211
You read minds?

603
00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:16.428
I can read every mind in this room.

604
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:17.763
Apart from yours.

605
00:43:20.265 --> 00:43:25.312
There's money, sex,

606
00:43:25.395 --> 00:43:29.149
money, sex,

607
00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:31.276
cat.

608
00:43:33.361 --> 00:43:36.448
And then you... nothing.

609
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.534
It's very frustrating.

610
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:44.414
Is there something wrong with me?

611
00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:48.627
See, I tell you I can read minds,

612
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.879
and you think there's
something wrong with you.

613
00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:01.389
What is it?

614
00:44:01.473 --> 00:44:08.021
I don't have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.

615
00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:12.108
Then don't.

616
00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:33.964
Okay, I think
I'm warm enough now.

617
00:44:41.054 --> 00:44:42.347
Your hand is so cold.

618
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:55.068
Whoa!

619
00:44:55.151 --> 00:44:56.486
What is going on?

620
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.825
My dad's still here.
Can you pull in?

621
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:06.705
That's my father's
car on the end.

622
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:09.499
What is he doing here?

623
00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.671
Carlisle, what's going on?

624
00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:19.426
Waylon Forge was found in a boat
out near his place.

625
00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:21.261
I just examined the body.

626
00:45:22.262 --> 00:45:25.891
He died? How?

627
00:45:25.974 --> 00:45:27.225
Animal attack.

628
00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:32.147
Was it the same one that got
that security guard down in Mason?

629
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.773
Most likely.

630
00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:35.293
Well, it's getting closer to town, then.

631
00:45:35.317 --> 00:45:37.360
Bella, you should go inside.

632
00:45:37.444 --> 00:45:40.363
Waylon was your father's friend.

633
00:45:40.447 --> 00:45:41.615
Okay.

634
00:45:43.074 --> 00:45:44.326
Um...

635
00:45:45.327 --> 00:45:47.287
I'll see you later.

636
00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:01.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

637
00:46:04.971 --> 00:46:06.765
Dad, I'm really sorry.

638
00:46:11.478 --> 00:46:13.521
I've known him going on 30 years.

639
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.706
Don't worry, we're gonna find this thing.

640
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:38.004
Meantime,
I want you to carry this with you.

641
00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:41.299
I don't know if you...

642
00:46:41.383 --> 00:46:43.593
It'll give your old man
some peace of mind.

643
00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:46.221
Okay.

644
00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:50.809
Let's go home.

645
00:47:36.855 --> 00:47:38.773
Cold One.

646
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.236
You're impossibly fast and strong.

647
00:49:49.529 --> 00:49:52.323
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.

648
00:49:53.408 --> 00:49:55.201
Your eyes change color.

649
00:49:56.286 --> 00:50:00.957
And sometimes you speak
like you're from a different time.

650
00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:06.045
You never eat or drink anything.
You don't go out in the sunlight.

651
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:10.717
How old are you?

652
00:50:12.594 --> 00:50:13.845
Seventeen.

653
00:50:16.347 --> 00:50:18.683
How long have you been 17?

654
00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:23.104
A while.

655
00:50:36.409 --> 00:50:38.036
I know what you are.

656
00:50:40.538 --> 00:50:41.623
Say it.

657
00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:46.586
Out loud.

658
00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:50.506
Say it.

659
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:58.598
Vampire.

660
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:03.561
Are you afraid?

661
00:51:11.778 --> 00:51:13.112
No.

662
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:18.409
Then ask me
the most basic question.

663
00:51:18.493 --> 00:51:20.203
What do we eat?

664
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:24.666
You won't hurt me.

665
00:51:29.879 --> 00:51:31.381
Where are we going?

666
00:51:32.924 --> 00:51:36.094
Up the mountain.
Out of the cloud bank.

667
00:51:36.177 --> 00:51:38.429
You need to see what I look like
in the sunlight.

668
00:51:58.491 --> 00:52:00.371
This is why we don't show
ourselves in sunlight.

669
00:52:01.119 --> 00:52:02.787
People would know we're different.

670
00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:15.300
This is what I am.

671
00:52:20.972 --> 00:52:22.515
It's like diamonds.

672
00:52:31.357 --> 00:52:32.775
You're beautiful.

673
00:52:36.362 --> 00:52:39.991
Beautiful? This is the skin
of a killer, Bella.

674
00:52:47.123 --> 00:52:48.499
I'm a killer.

675
00:52:50.752 --> 00:52:52.337
I don't believe that.

676
00:52:53.338 --> 00:52:55.548
That's because
you believe the lie.

677
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:58.384
It's camouflage.

678
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.057
I'm the world's most dangerous predator.

679
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.894
Everything about me
invites you in--

680
00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:11.230
My voice, my face,
even my smell.

681
00:53:12.273 --> 00:53:14.859
As if I would need any of that.

682
00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.364
As if you could outrun me!

683
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:27.163
As if you could fight me off.

684
00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.919
I'm designed to kill.

685
00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.215
I don't care.

686
00:53:38.466 --> 00:53:40.843
I've killed people before.

687
00:53:42.387 --> 00:53:43.763
It does not matter.

688
00:53:48.851 --> 00:53:50.853
I wanted to kill you.

689
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:58.569
I've never wanted a human's blood
so much in my life.

690
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:01.239
I trust you.

691
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:05.201
Don't.

692
00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:07.954
I'm here. I trust you.

693
00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:16.295
My family, we're different
from others of our kind.

694
00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:17.922
We only hunt animals.

695
00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.299
We've learned to control our thirst.

696
00:54:21.551 --> 00:54:24.720
But it's you, your scent?

697
00:54:26.806 --> 00:54:28.724
It's like a drug to me.

698
00:54:30.435 --> 00:54:34.355
You're like my own
personal brand of heroin.

699
00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.531
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?

700
00:54:44.532 --> 00:54:48.661
I did... only for making me
want you so badly.

701
00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:52.165
I still don't know
if I can control myself.

702
00:54:54.584 --> 00:54:56.210
I know you can.

703
00:55:04.677 --> 00:55:06.387
I can't read your mind.

704
00:55:07.388 --> 00:55:09.807
You have to tell me
what you're thinking.

705
00:55:12.852 --> 00:55:14.312
Now I'm afraid.

706
00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:20.610
Good.

707
00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:23.946
I'm not afraid of you.

708
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.536
I'm only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.

709
00:55:38.878 --> 00:55:41.130
You don't know how long
I've waited for you.

710
00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:52.600
And so the lion fell in love
with the lamb.

711
00:55:56.562 --> 00:56:01.484
- What a stupid lamb.
- What a sick, masochistic lion.

712
00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:29.363
About three things
I was absolutely positive.

713
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:35.369
First, Edward was a vampire.

714
00:57:39.999 --> 00:57:43.961
Second, there was a part of him,

715
00:57:44.045 --> 00:57:46.172
and I didn't know how dominant
that part might be...

716
00:57:46.255 --> 00:57:49.634
that thirsted for my blood.

717
00:57:53.846 --> 00:57:56.307
And third,

718
00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:00.186
I was unconditionally
and irrevocably in love with him.

719
00:58:06.025 --> 00:58:08.277
Monte Carlo?
That's our prom theme?

720
00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:13.699
Mm-hmm. Gambling, tuxedos,
and Bond, James Bond.

721
00:58:17.662 --> 00:58:19.872
Oh, my God.

722
00:58:28.547 --> 00:58:30.216
Wow. Ahem.

723
00:58:31.884 --> 00:58:33.552
You know, everybody's staring.

724
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.519
Not that guy.
No, he just looked.

725
00:58:43.938 --> 00:58:48.401
I'm breaking all the rules now anyway,
since I'm going to hell.

726
00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:56.075
So, does a person have to be dying...

727
00:58:58.744 --> 00:59:00.162
to become like you?

728
00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:04.166
No, that's just Carlisle.

729
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:08.087
He'd never do this to someone
who had another choice.

730
00:59:10.756 --> 00:59:12.967
So, how long have you been like this?

731
00:59:14.427 --> 00:59:16.721
Since 1918.

732
00:59:16.804 --> 00:59:20.349
That's when Carlisle found me
dying of Spanish influenza.

733
00:59:22.685 --> 00:59:23.853
What was it like?

734
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.023
The venom was excruciating.

735
00:59:28.107 --> 00:59:30.234
But what Carlisle did
was much harder.

736
00:59:30.317 --> 00:59:32.778
Not many of us have
the restraint to do that.

737
00:59:32.862 --> 00:59:35.448
But didn't he just have to bite?

738
00:59:37.783 --> 00:59:39.702
Not exactly.

739
00:59:39.785 --> 00:59:44.999
When we taste human blood,

740
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:47.585
a sort of frenzy begins...

741
00:59:48.627 --> 00:59:50.838
and it's almost impossible to stop.

742
00:59:53.424 --> 00:59:55.134
But Carlisle did.

743
00:59:55.217 --> 00:59:58.053
First with me
and then with his wife, Esme.

744
00:59:58.137 --> 01:00:02.600
So is Carlisle the real reason that you
don't kill people?

745
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.688
No, he's not the only reason.

746
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.903
I don't want to be a monster.

747
01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:19.617
My family, we think of ourselves
as vegetarians, right,

748
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.660
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.

749
01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.413
But it's...

750
01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:28.083
It's like a human only living on tofu.

751
01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:32.755
It keeps you strong, but you're never
fully satisfied.

752
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.260
It wouldn't be like drinking your blood,
for instance.

753
01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.561
Was it other vampires
that killed Waylon?

754
01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.646
Yeah.

755
01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:52.858
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.

756
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:59.031
Can the rest of your family
read people's minds like you can?

757
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.036
No. That's just me.

758
01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:07.915
But Alice-- Alice can see the future.

759
01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.584
I bet she saw me coming.

760
01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:15.047
Alice's visions are subjective.

761
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.299
I mean, the future
can always change.

762
01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:31.063
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.

763
01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.815
I'm gonna take you
to my place tomorrow.

764
01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.487
Thanks. Wait,
like, with your family?

765
01:01:39.655 --> 01:01:41.490
Yeah.

766
01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:44.535
What if they don't like me?

767
01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:48.205
So, you're worried not because you'll be
in a house full of vampires,

768
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:50.374
but because you think
they won't approve of you?

769
01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.168
I'm glad I amuse you.

770
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.255
What is it?

771
01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.466
Complication.

772
01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:03.304
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

773
01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:32.583
Hey. Come to visit your truck?

774
01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:36.712
- Looks good. Got that dent out.
- Yeah.

775
01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.756
Actually, we came to visit
your flat-screen.

776
01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:41.050
First Mariners game of the season.

777
01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:44.845
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me
about seeing you again.

778
01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.722
Great, Dad. Thanks.

779
01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.223
Just keeping it real, son.

780
01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:51.769
Vitamin R.

781
01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:54.063
Well done, Chief.

782
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:56.523
Harry Clear water's homemade fish fry.

783
01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:57.816
Good man.

784
01:03:00.486 --> 01:03:01.946
Any luck with that Waylon case?

785
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:04.865
Well, I don't think
it was an animal that killed him.

786
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:06.742
Never thought it was.

787
01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:12.164
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?
Keep the kids out of the woods.

788
01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:14.249
Will do.

789
01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:16.669
Don't want no one else
getting hurt, do we?

790
01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.535
Whoa.

791
01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.830
This is incredible.

792
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.752
It's so light and open,
you know?

793
01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:04.883
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?

794
01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:09.221
- No, not the moats.
- "Not the moats."

795
01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:18.897
This is the one place
we don't have to hide.

796
01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:23.527
I told them not to do this.

797
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.781
You add a little bit of olive oil
to a non-stick sautÃ© pan,

798
01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:31.201
and you want to cook with the olive oil
in medium-high heat.

799
01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:35.080
What I do, I cut this in strips,
and then we gonna cut this in dice.

800
01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:38.292
- Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.

801
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.210
I'm sure she'll love it,
no matter what.

802
01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:43.714
Get a whiff of that.

803
01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.841
Here comes the human.

804
01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:52.389
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.

805
01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:55.476
- Oh. Um...
- Bella, this is Esme,

806
01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.603
my mother for all
intents and purposes.

807
01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.730
- Buon giorno.
- Molto bene.

808
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:03.043
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time.

809
01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:05.360
- I hope you're hungry.
- Yeah, absolutely.

810
01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:06.445
She already ate.

811
01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.161
Perfect.

812
01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:19.291
Yeah, it's just because I know
you guys don't eat...

813
01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.835
Of course. It's very considerate of you.

814
01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:24.296
- Just ignore Rosalie. I do.
- Yeah.

815
01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:27.883
Let's just keep pretending
like this isn't dangerous for all of us.

816
01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:31.970
I would never tell
anybody anything.

817
01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.806
She knows that.

818
01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.975
Yeah, well, the problem is, you two
have gone public now, so...

819
01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:38.936
- Emmett.
- No, she should know.

820
01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:43.982
The entire family will be implicated
if this ends badly.

821
01:05:44.066 --> 01:05:47.319
Badly, as in...

822
01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.321
I would become the meal.

823
01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.330
Hi, Bella.

824
01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:04.461
I'm Alice.

825
01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:06.421
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.842
You do smell good.

827
01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:11.051
Alice, what are you...

828
01:06:11.135 --> 01:06:13.720
It's okay. Bella and I are
gonna be great friends.

829
01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:20.394
Sorry, Jasper's
our newest vegetarian.

830
01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.563
It's a little difficult for him.

831
01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.523
It's a pleasure to meet you.

832
01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:27.526
It's okay, Jasper.
You won't hurt her.

833
01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:32.531
All right, I'm gonna take you on a tour
of the rest of the house.

834
01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.449
- Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.

835
01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.243
Okay.

836
01:06:38.162 --> 01:06:40.205
- Cute!
- I know.

837
01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:43.917
- I think that went well.
- Clean this up. Now.

838
01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:47.212
Was that as weird for you
as it was for me?

839
01:06:47.296 --> 01:06:48.755
I don't know.

840
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.514
Graduation caps?

841
01:06:57.598 --> 01:07:01.226
Yeah. It's a private joke.

842
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:02.728
We matriculate a lot.

843
01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:09.610
That's kind of miserable. I mean,
repeating high school over and over.

844
01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.778
True, but the younger
we start out in a new place,

845
01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.989
the longer we can stay there.

846
01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:15.157
Come on.

847
01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.336
Yeah, this is my room.

848
01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:41.433
No bed?

849
01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:46.021
No, I don't... I don't sleep.

850
01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:49.691
- Ever?
- No, not at all.

851
01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.071
Okay.

852
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.581
Boy, you have so much music.

853
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.793
What are you listening to?

854
01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.881
It's Debussy.

855
01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:16.927
- I don't know...
- Yeah.

856
01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.432
Claire De Lune is great.

857
01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:01.346
- What?
- I can't dance.

858
01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.394
Hmm...

859
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.732
Well, I could always make you.

860
01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:16.069
I'm not scared of you.

861
01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.700
Well, you really
shouldn't have said that.

862
01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:30.042
You better hold on tight,
spider monkey.

863
01:09:35.172 --> 01:09:36.256
Do you trust me?

864
01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:38.633
In theory.

865
01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:40.886
Then close your eyes.

866
01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:07.412
What?

867
01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:10.916
This isn't real.

868
01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:13.585
This kind of stuff just doesn't exist.

869
01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:15.212
It does in my world.

870
01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:46.595
Hold up.

871
01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.268
It's human.

872
01:11:57.606 --> 01:12:00.984
Arizona.
Yo, what's happening?

873
01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.069
So you and Cullen, huh?

874
01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:05.447
That's... I don't like it.

875
01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:10.202
I mean, I don't know, he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.

876
01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:15.916
Here's your veggie plate, Stephanie.

877
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:20.712
Hey, sorry I'm late. Biology project.

878
01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.673
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope that's okay.

879
01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:28.136
You should order one for yourself
next time, cut back on the steak.

880
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.305
Hey, I'm as healthy as a horse.

881
01:12:31.473 --> 01:12:33.600
Say, Chief, boys want to know.

882
01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:38.188
Did you find anything
down by Queets River today?

883
01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:43.902
Yeah, we found
a bare human footprint,

884
01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:46.363
but it looks like whoever that is
is headed east,

885
01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:49.199
so Kitsap County Sheriff
is gonna take over from here.

886
01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.617
- Okay.
- Okay?

887
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.495
I just hope they catch him fast.

888
01:13:02.504 --> 01:13:04.104
Looks like your friends
are flagging you.

889
01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:10.845
It's okay if you wanna go join them.
I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.

890
01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.223
Me, too.

891
01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:15.392
Bella, it's Friday night. Go out.

892
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:19.354
Looks like the Newton boy's
got a big smile for you.

893
01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.439
Yeah, he's a good buddy.

894
01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:25.652
What about any of these other
yahoos in town? Anybody interest you?

895
01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.614
Dad, we're gonna talk about boys?

896
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:32.951
Yeah, I guess not.

897
01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:37.789
I just feel like I leave you alone
too much.

898
01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.874
You should be around people.

899
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.836
I don't really mind being alone.

900
01:13:44.296 --> 01:13:46.590
I guess I'm kind
of like my dad in that way.

901
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.097
So, how's all the baseball stuff going?

902
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.142
Oh, Phil's working so hard.

903
01:13:57.225 --> 01:13:59.644
You know, spring training.

904
01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:02.331
We're looking for a house to rent in case
things become more permanent.

905
01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.650
- You'd like Jacksonville, baby.
- Yeah?

906
01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:08.737
- I'm really liking Forks.
- What?

907
01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:12.532
Forks is growing on me.

908
01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:14.367
Could a guy have anything
to do with that?

909
01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:18.997
- Well, yeah.
- I knew it.

910
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.666
Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?

911
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.501
I bet he's smart. Is he smart?

912
01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.506
Mom, can I talk to you later?

913
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.717
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?

914
01:14:37.057 --> 01:14:38.266
How did you get in here?

915
01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.311
The window.

916
01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:42.937
Do you do that a lot?

917
01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:46.483
Well, just the past couple of months.

918
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.490
I like watching you sleep. It's, um...

919
01:14:55.617 --> 01:14:57.202
It's kind of fascinating to me.

920
01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:01.414
Um...

921
01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.501
I always want to try one thing.

922
01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:08.004
Just stay very still.

923
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.596
Don't move.

924
01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.766
Stop it!

925
01:16:04.686 --> 01:16:06.104
I'm sorry.

926
01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.316
I'm stronger than I thought.

927
01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.695
Yeah. I wish
I could say the same.

928
01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:21.244
I can't ever lose control with you.

929
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:29.544
Hey, don't go.

930
01:17:17.342 --> 01:17:20.011
- Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.

931
01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.888
I have a date with Edward Cullen.

932
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.601
He's a little old for you, isn't he?

933
01:17:27.769 --> 01:17:30.814
No. He's a junior. I'm a junior.

934
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.942
I thought you
liked the Cullens.

935
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.821
I thought you didn't like
any of the boys in town.

936
01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.781
Edward doesn't live in town.

937
01:17:40.782 --> 01:17:41.908
Technically.

938
01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:48.289
- He's right outside.
- He is?

939
01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:51.417
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.

940
01:17:53.962 --> 01:17:56.548
All right. Bring him in.

941
01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:02.136
Could you be nice? He's--
He's important.

942
01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:15.900
Chief Swan.

943
01:18:15.984 --> 01:18:19.320
I want to formally introduce myself.
I'm Edward Cullen.

944
01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:20.738
Hi, Edward.

945
01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.050
Bella won't be out too late tonight.

946
01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:25.410
She's just gonna play baseball
with my family.

947
01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:27.745
- Baseball?
- Yes, sir, that's the plan.

948
01:18:27.829 --> 01:18:30.540
Bella's gonna play baseball.

949
01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:33.585
Well, good luck with that.

950
01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.712
I'll take good care of her. I promise.

951
01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:40.633
Hey.

952
01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:45.263
- Still got that pepper spray?
- Yeah, Dad.

953
01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:53.229
And since when do
vampires like baseball?

954
01:18:53.313 --> 01:18:58.651
Well, it's the American pastime,
and there's a thunderstorm coming.

955
01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:01.446
It's the only time we can play.
You'll see why.

956
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:15.752
Hey.

957
01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.795
Glad you're here.
We need an umpire.

958
01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:20.757
- She thinks we cheat.
- I know you cheat.

959
01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:25.511
- Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.

960
01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:36.439
It's time.

961
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.033
Okay, now I see why
you need the thunder.

962
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.333
That's gotta be
a home run, right?

963
01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:56.751
Edward's very fast.

964
01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:06.970
Come home, Rosalie!

965
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.016
- You're out.
- Out! Whoo!

966
01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:15.520
Babe, come on. It's just a game.

967
01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:22.276
Nice kitty.

968
01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:44.841
What are you doing?

969
01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.319
My monkey man.

970
01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.209
Stop!

971
01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.896
They were leaving.
Then they heard us.

972
01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:41.481
- Let's go.
- It's too late.

973
01:21:43.483 --> 01:21:44.901
Get your hair down.

974
01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.030
Like that'll help. I can smell her
from across the field.

975
01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:58.122
I shouldn't have brought you here.
I'm so sorry.

976
01:21:58.206 --> 01:22:00.792
- What? What--
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.

977
01:22:23.231 --> 01:22:24.816
I believe this belongs to you.

978
01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:29.779
Thank you.

979
01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.697
I am Laurent.

980
01:22:31.781 --> 01:22:35.201
And this is Victoria

981
01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.702
and James.

982
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.956
I'm Carlisle.
This is my family.

983
01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.334
Hello.

984
01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:47.255
I'm afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us.

985
01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:51.551
Our apologies. We didn't realize the
territory had been claimed.

986
01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:56.264
Yes, well, we maintain a permanent
residence nearby.

987
01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.558
Really?

988
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:06.190
Well, we won't be a problem anymore.
We were just passing through.

989
01:23:06.274 --> 01:23:09.402
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.

990
01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.695
You should be safe.

991
01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:12.864
Excellent.

992
01:23:14.157 --> 01:23:17.702
So, could you use
three more players?

993
01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:21.956
Oh, come on. Just one game.

994
01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.834
Sure. Why not?

995
01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.086
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.

996
01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:29.213
We'll bat first.

997
01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:31.899
I'm the one with the wicked curve ball.

998
01:23:32.717 --> 01:23:35.761
- Well, I think we can handle that.
- Oh...

999
01:23:35.845 --> 01:23:38.014
We shall see.

1000
01:23:58.326 --> 01:23:59.785
You brought a snack.

1001
01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:03.873
A human?

1002
01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.295
The girl is with us.

1003
01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:10.922
I think it best if you leave.

1004
01:24:15.343 --> 01:24:16.677
I can see the game is over.

1005
01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.055
We'll go now.

1006
01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:22.850
James.

1007
01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:37.406
Get Bella out of here.

1008
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:38.866
Go.

1009
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.712
Okay, I've got it!
I've got it! I'm all right!

1010
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.883
What, now he's coming after me?

1011
01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.853
Listen to me. James is a tracker.

1012
01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:10.231
The hunt is his obsession.
I read his mind.

1013
01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:11.983
My reaction on the field set him off.

1014
01:25:12.066 --> 01:25:15.820
I just made this his most exciting
game ever.

1015
01:25:15.903 --> 01:25:17.130
- He's never gonna stop.
- What should we do?

1016
01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:20.074
We have to kill him. Rip him apart
and burn the pieces.

1017
01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.618
- Where we going?
- Away from Forks.

1018
01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:23.953
We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.

1019
01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.579
I have to go home. Now.

1020
01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:29.083
- You have to take me home.
- You can't go home.

1021
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:32.145
He's just gonna trace your scent there.
It's the first place he's gonna look.

1022
01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.213
- But my dad is there. We...
- It doesn't matter!

1023
01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:36.299
Yes, it does! He could get killed
because of us!

1024
01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.445
Just let me get you
out of here first, all right?

1025
01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:43.180
It's my dad!
We have to go back!

1026
01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:45.158
We'll figure a way to lead the tracker
away somehow.

1027
01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:46.822
I don't know. But we have to
do something.

1028
01:25:52.982 --> 01:25:55.609
- Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella, don't do this, please.

1029
01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:57.278
It's over! Get out!

1030
01:25:57.361 --> 01:26:00.698
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Bella? What's going on?

1031
01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:04.618
I just gotta get out of here.
I'm leaving now.

1032
01:26:06.746 --> 01:26:07.913
Hey.

1033
01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:12.626
Bella?

1034
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:16.380
What am I gonna say to him?
I can't hurt him.

1035
01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:20.885
- Bella, what's going on?
- You just have to.

1036
01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.178
I'll be down at the truck.

1037
01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:30.561
Did he hurt you?

1038
01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.854
No.

1039
01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:38.527
- Break up with you or something?
- No, I broke up with him.

1040
01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:47.370
- I thought you liked him.
- Yeah, that's why I have to leave.

1041
01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:50.122
I don't want this.
I have to go home.

1042
01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:55.294
Home? Your-- your mom's
not even in Phoenix.

1043
01:26:55.378 --> 01:26:57.630
She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.

1044
01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:01.425
You're not gonna drive home right now.
You can sleep on it.

1045
01:27:01.509 --> 01:27:04.429
If you still feel like going in the
morning, I'll take you to the airport.

1046
01:27:04.512 --> 01:27:08.015
No. I want to drive.
It'll give me more time to think.

1047
01:27:08.099 --> 01:27:10.893
I mean, if I get really tired,
I'll pull into a motel. I promise.

1048
01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:15.689
Look, Bella, I know I'm not that much fun
to be around, but I can change that.

1049
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:18.401
We can do more stuff together.

1050
01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:25.074
Like what?
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?

1051
01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.536
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?

1052
01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:30.663
Dad, that's you.
That's not me.

1053
01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:37.920
Bella, come on, I just...
I just got you back.

1054
01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:43.384
Yeah, and, you know,
if I don't get out now,

1055
01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.678
then I'm just gonna be
stuck here like Mom.

1056
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:12.955
Your father's gonna forgive you.

1057
01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:16.542
Why don't you let me drive?

1058
01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:23.966
He won't.

1059
01:28:25.176 --> 01:28:27.219
You should've seen his face.

1060
01:28:29.138 --> 01:28:32.600
I told him the same thing that my mom told
him when she was leaving him.

1061
01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:34.935
It's the only way he'd let you go.

1062
01:28:38.022 --> 01:28:39.482
Just don't worry about him now.

1063
01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:42.359
He's safe.
The tracker's following us.

1064
01:28:43.694 --> 01:28:46.113
Oh, God.

1065
01:28:46.197 --> 01:28:48.157
It's just Emmett.

1066
01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:51.535
Alice is in the car behind us.

1067
01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:14.808
Wait.

1068
01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:18.229
He came to warn us about James.

1069
01:29:18.312 --> 01:29:22.525
This isn't my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,

1070
01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:25.528
but he's got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.

1071
01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:28.614
I've never seen anything like him
in my 300 years.

1072
01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:32.618
And the woman, Victoria,
don't underestimate her.

1073
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:39.851
I've had to fight our kind before.
We're not easy to kill.

1074
01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:42.169
But not impossible.

1075
01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:44.338
We'll tear them apart
and burn the pieces.

1076
01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.358
I don't relish the thought
of killing another creature,

1077
01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:48.884
even a sadistic one like James.

1078
01:29:48.968 --> 01:29:50.844
What if he kills one of us first?

1079
01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:53.568
I'm gonna run Bella south. Can you lead
the tracker away from here?

1080
01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.575
No, Edward. James knows you would never
leave Bella.

1081
01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:57.810
- He'll follow you.
- I'll go with Bella.

1082
01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.728
Jasper and I
will drive her south.

1083
01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:01.313
I'll keep her safe, Edward.

1084
01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:04.358
- Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.

1085
01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:11.031
Rosalie, Esme,

1086
01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:15.744
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent?

1087
01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:19.832
Why? What is she to me?

1088
01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:24.503
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.
She's part of this family now.

1089
01:30:26.589 --> 01:30:28.507
And we protect our family.

1090
01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:49.653
Oh, God. If anything--
What if--

1091
01:30:49.737 --> 01:30:53.574
- If anything happens, I swear to God...
- Nothing's gonna happen.

1092
01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:56.327
There's seven of us,
and there's two of them,

1093
01:30:56.410 --> 01:31:00.080
and when everything's done,
I'm gonna come back and get you.

1094
01:31:00.164 --> 01:31:01.957
Yeah.

1095
01:31:02.041 --> 01:31:04.251
Bella, you are my life now.

1096
01:31:21.852 --> 01:31:25.606
Hey, Mom, it's me again. You must have
let your phone die or something.

1097
01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:30.027
I'm not in Forks, but everything's okay,
and I'll explain it later.

1098
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:38.661
Rosalie, mark the tree.

1099
01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:42.456
That's good.

1100
01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:32.548
What is it? What do you see?

1101
01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:46.061
He's figured it out.

1102
01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:49.481
The tracker,
he just changed course.

1103
01:32:50.566 --> 01:32:52.484
- Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.

1104
01:32:52.568 --> 01:32:53.944
A room full of mirrors.

1105
01:32:58.449 --> 01:33:00.534
Edward said the visions
weren't always certain.

1106
01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:03.555
She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.

1107
01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:06.081
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.

1108
01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:11.754
Okay, so the course that the tracker's on
now is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?

1109
01:33:11.837 --> 01:33:15.549
- You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.

1110
01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:17.512
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.

1111
01:33:17.593 --> 01:33:19.511
- Was your school here in Phoenix?
- Yeah.

1112
01:33:21.889 --> 01:33:23.809
- Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.

1113
01:33:23.891 --> 01:33:25.350
The woman's still in the area.

1114
01:33:25.434 --> 01:33:28.228
Rosalie and Esme are going back to Forks
to protect your father.

1115
01:33:28.312 --> 01:33:34.026
I'm coming to get you. Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.

1116
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:35.819
And the others will keep hunting.

1117
01:33:35.903 --> 01:33:38.697
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.

1118
01:33:50.626 --> 01:33:53.212
Hey, Mom,
I'm glad you got my message.

1119
01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:54.630
What are you doing home?

1120
01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:58.091
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1121
01:33:58.175 --> 01:34:01.094
- Calm down, everything's fine.
- Bella? Bella?

1122
01:34:01.178 --> 01:34:04.765
I'll explain everything later.
Mom, are you there?

1123
01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:08.894
Forks High School doesn't protect its
students' privacy very well.

1124
01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:13.065
It was just too easy for Victoria to find
your previous address.

1125
01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.776
It's a nice house you have here.

1126
01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:19.238
I was prepared to wait for you,
but then Mom came home

1127
01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:23.450
after she received a very
worried call from your dad,

1128
01:34:23.534 --> 01:34:25.661
and it all worked out quite well.

1129
01:34:26.662 --> 01:34:29.122
- Wait, wait...
- Don't touch her! Don't--

1130
01:34:29.206 --> 01:34:31.542
- You can still save her.
- Don't!

1131
01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.919
But you're gonna have to get away
from your friends.

1132
01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:35.546
Can you handle that?

1133
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:38.966
Where should I meet you?

1134
01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:41.176
How about your old ballet studio?

1135
01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:44.304
And I'll know if you bring anyone along.

1136
01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:49.935
You poor Mommy would pay the price
for that mistake.

1137
01:35:07.244 --> 01:35:09.746
I'd never given much thought
to how I would die.

1138
01:35:11.081 --> 01:35:15.043
But dying in the place of someone I love
seems like a good way to go.

1139
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:25.220
I can't bring myself to regret

1140
01:35:25.304 --> 01:35:28.181
the decisions that brought me
face-to-face with death.

1141
01:35:28.265 --> 01:35:30.225
They also brought me to Edward.

1142
01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:02.716
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?

1143
01:36:02.799 --> 01:36:04.051
- Mom?
- Bella?

1144
01:36:04.134 --> 01:36:05.677
- Mom?
- There you are.

1145
01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.220
What are you doing in here?

1146
01:36:07.304 --> 01:36:08.805
Everyone makes fun of me.

1147
01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:12.184
Come on, you're a wonderful dancer.

1148
01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:14.853
Mom, I suck.

1149
01:36:14.937 --> 01:36:18.649
You do not suck.

1150
01:36:27.866 --> 01:36:29.368
That's my favorite part.

1151
01:36:31.161 --> 01:36:34.456
You were a stubborn child,
weren't you? Hmm?

1152
01:36:35.624 --> 01:36:37.542
- She's not even here.
- No.

1153
01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:41.755
Sorry.

1154
01:36:41.838 --> 01:36:44.925
You know, but you really
made it too easy.

1155
01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:48.971
So to make things
more entertaining,

1156
01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:51.807
I'm gonna make a little film
of our time together.

1157
01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:57.104
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you don't mind.

1158
01:36:57.187 --> 01:36:59.481
Good. And...

1159
01:37:00.941 --> 01:37:02.526
action.

1160
01:37:04.695 --> 01:37:06.405
That'll break Edward's little heart.

1161
01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:08.824
You have... Edward has
nothing to do with this!

1162
01:37:08.907 --> 01:37:11.535
But he does.

1163
01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:14.287
Oh, his rage will make
for more interesting sport

1164
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:17.833
than his... oh, his feeble attempt
to protect you.

1165
01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:20.585
And let's continue.

1166
01:37:36.101 --> 01:37:39.980
Beautiful. Very visually dynamic.

1167
01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:44.317
I chose my stage well.

1168
01:37:49.656 --> 01:37:52.492
It's too bad he didn't have
the strength to turn you.

1169
01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:56.204
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.

1170
01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:57.998
It's cruel, really.

1171
01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:04.463
Tell Edward how much it hurts.

1172
01:38:05.547 --> 01:38:07.299
Tell him to avenge you. Tell him!

1173
01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:09.801
- No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him! Tell him!

1174
01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:26.777
You're alone 'cause you're faster
than the others.

1175
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.322
But not stronger.

1176
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.700
I'm strong enough to kill you.

1177
01:38:40.791 --> 01:38:41.833
I'm sorry.

1178
01:39:46.273 --> 01:39:47.482
Bella, Bella, it's okay.

1179
01:39:47.566 --> 01:39:50.110
Son. Enough.

1180
01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:52.362
Remember who you are.

1181
01:39:57.576 --> 01:40:00.120
- Bella, you're okay.
- Bella needs you.

1182
01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:02.789
It's okay. It's okay.

1183
01:40:02.873 --> 01:40:04.124
Oh, God.

1184
01:40:08.003 --> 01:40:09.921
Carlisle? Her blood.

1185
01:40:10.005 --> 01:40:11.566
- Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.

1186
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:12.883
- Carlisle!
- Start the fire.

1187
01:40:12.966 --> 01:40:14.384
Get the floorboards.

1188
01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:18.388
- Alice!
- Alice, go.

1189
01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:30.084
Her femoral artery's been severed.
She's losing too much blood.

1190
01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:32.194
No, no, my hand is burning!

1191
01:40:33.862 --> 01:40:35.197
It's the venom.

1192
01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:39.075
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.

1193
01:40:40.285 --> 01:40:41.286
No.

1194
01:40:42.287 --> 01:40:43.538
No.

1195
01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:46.458
It's gonna happen, Edward.
I've seen it.

1196
01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:49.628
- It doesn't have to be that way.
- She's still hemorrhaging.

1197
01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:51.546
Alice, make me a tourniquet.
Your belt.

1198
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:53.924
Carlisle, what's my other option?

1199
01:40:55.217 --> 01:40:57.302
Tie it above my hands.

1200
01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:58.595
Carlisle!

1201
01:41:00.722 --> 01:41:01.848
Go.

1202
01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:07.788
We could try to suck the venom out.

1203
01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.941
- You know I won't be able to stop.
- Then find the will to stop.

1204
01:41:12.609 --> 01:41:15.195
But choose.
She only has minutes left.

1205
01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:19.810
I'm gonna make it go away, Bella.

1206
01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:24.913
I'm gonna make it go away.

1207
01:41:43.765 --> 01:41:45.016
Edward, stop.

1208
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.018
Her blood is clean.
You're killing her.

1209
01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:49.437
Edward.

1210
01:41:49.521 --> 01:41:50.939
Stop.

1211
01:41:52.023 --> 01:41:53.733
Stop.

1212
01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:56.403
Find the will.

1213
01:42:20.969 --> 01:42:24.764
Death is peaceful, easy.

1214
01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:34.107
Life is harder.

1215
01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.946
Bella?

1216
01:42:42.115 --> 01:42:43.158
Baby?

1217
01:42:44.951 --> 01:42:46.161
Bella.

1218
01:42:47.996 --> 01:42:49.664
- Mom?
- Hey.

1219
01:42:49.748 --> 01:42:52.834
Where is he? Where's...

1220
01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:56.171
- Where's Edward?
- He's asleep.

1221
01:42:58.006 --> 01:43:01.468
He never leaves. And your dad,
he's down at the cafeteria.

1222
01:43:02.844 --> 01:43:04.971
What happened?

1223
01:43:05.055 --> 01:43:10.185
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg,
and you lost a lot of blood.

1224
01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:13.688
You don't remember
any of this, do you?

1225
01:43:15.857 --> 01:43:20.070
Edward came down with his dad to try
to convince you to come back to Forks.

1226
01:43:20.153 --> 01:43:23.490
So you went over to their hotel,
and then you tripped,

1227
01:43:23.573 --> 01:43:26.951
and you fell down
two flights of stairs.

1228
01:43:27.035 --> 01:43:28.244
Went through a window!

1229
01:43:35.126 --> 01:43:36.961
Yeah, that sounds like me.

1230
01:43:37.045 --> 01:43:39.214
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1231
01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:46.221
It's Phil. He's so worried about you.

1232
01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:51.267
- You're texting.
- Finally, yeah.

1233
01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.397
I told him to stay down in Florida.

1234
01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.899
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.

1235
01:43:57.982 --> 01:44:01.486
It's sunny every day, and we found
the cutest little house,

1236
01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:02.849
and you've got
your own bathroom.

1237
01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:04.531
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.

1238
01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:07.659
What?

1239
01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:09.077
I want to live in Forks.

1240
01:44:10.078 --> 01:44:12.539
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.

1241
01:44:14.207 --> 01:44:16.835
Do you mind getting Dad?

1242
01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:19.754
I have to talk to him.
Apologize.

1243
01:44:19.838 --> 01:44:22.674
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.

1244
01:44:23.675 --> 01:44:26.386
- And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.

1245
01:44:38.314 --> 01:44:41.443
So what happened?
Where's James?

1246
01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:44.487
We took care of it.

1247
01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:53.580
And the woman,
Victoria, she ran off.

1248
01:44:54.706 --> 01:44:56.666
I'm alive because of you.

1249
01:44:56.749 --> 01:44:59.252
No, you're in here because of me.

1250
01:45:00.879 --> 01:45:06.551
The worst part of it was that I thought
I wasn't gonna be able to stop.

1251
01:45:07.552 --> 01:45:08.928
You did stop.

1252
01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:14.767
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I can't hurt you anymore.

1253
01:45:16.769 --> 01:45:17.937
What?

1254
01:45:21.107 --> 01:45:23.818
Are you... No! No!

1255
01:45:26.321 --> 01:45:28.072
I don't even know
what you're-- How--

1256
01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:30.950
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away? I can't--

1257
01:45:31.034 --> 01:45:33.578
No, I can't--
I can't just leave you--

1258
01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:34.704
I know.

1259
01:45:36.873 --> 01:45:39.751
We can't be apart.
You can't leave me.

1260
01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.295
I'm here.

1261
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.970
Okay, just don't-- You just can't say
stuff like that to me. Ever.

1262
01:45:54.974 --> 01:45:58.269
Where else am I gonna go?

1263
01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:51.531
Alice lent me the dress.
The cast is...

1264
01:46:52.991 --> 01:46:53.992
You're perfect.

1265
01:46:57.370 --> 01:46:59.539
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.

1266
01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:02.125
Uh-huh. I've heard that before.

1267
01:47:06.671 --> 01:47:08.172
All right, Bells.

1268
01:47:10.592 --> 01:47:13.177
I put a new can
of pepper spray in your bag.

1269
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:14.554
Dad.

1270
01:47:14.637 --> 01:47:16.180
And, uh...

1271
01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:20.893
Well, you look beautiful.

1272
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:23.771
Thanks.

1273
01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:27.025
- See you.
- Yeah.

1274
01:47:34.157 --> 01:47:37.285
Hey. I'll be right back.

1275
01:47:39.662 --> 01:47:41.122
- Bella.
- Jacob.

1276
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:44.959
- Hey.
- Nice.

1277
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.211
You, too.

1278
01:47:47.295 --> 01:47:49.855
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?

1279
01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:51.591
No.

1280
01:47:56.054 --> 01:47:58.765
My dad paid me to come talk to you.

1281
01:47:58.848 --> 01:48:03.186
- Twenty bucks.
- Let's hear it.

1282
01:48:03.269 --> 01:48:04.937
Just don't get mad, okay?

1283
01:48:06.898 --> 01:48:09.233
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.

1284
01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:16.157
It's just, he said, quote,
"We'll be watching you."

1285
01:48:17.158 --> 01:48:19.702
Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."

1286
01:48:19.786 --> 01:48:21.329
Okay.

1287
01:48:21.412 --> 01:48:24.499
- And to pay up.
- Okay. Oh, let me help you.

1288
01:48:24.582 --> 01:48:27.460
Jacob. I'll take it from here.

1289
01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.007
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.

1290
01:48:35.802 --> 01:48:36.886
All right.

1291
01:48:44.143 --> 01:48:47.313
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.

1292
01:48:54.821 --> 01:48:56.298
I can't believe you're making me do this.

1293
01:48:56.322 --> 01:48:57.532
Just smile.

1294
01:49:18.344 --> 01:49:21.305
Wow. You are really trying to kill me.

1295
01:49:21.389 --> 01:49:23.391
The prom is an important
rite of passage.

1296
01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:25.935
I didn't want you to miss anything.

1297
01:49:26.018 --> 01:49:27.186
Oh.

1298
01:49:53.963 --> 01:49:54.964
Bella, hey!

1299
01:49:58.676 --> 01:50:00.762
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah.

1300
01:50:00.845 --> 01:50:03.556
All right, slowing it down.

1301
01:50:09.103 --> 01:50:11.689
Shall we?

1302
01:50:11.773 --> 01:50:13.399
You're serious?

1303
01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:16.277
Oh, why not?

1304
01:50:31.501 --> 01:50:34.712
See, you're dancing.

1305
01:50:34.796 --> 01:50:36.255
At prom.

1306
01:50:57.193 --> 01:50:59.612
Edward, why did you save me?

1307
01:50:59.695 --> 01:51:04.200
If you just let the venom spread,
I could be like you by now.

1308
01:51:06.744 --> 01:51:10.039
You don't know
what you're saying.

1309
01:51:10.122 --> 01:51:12.542
- You don't want this.
- I want you.

1310
01:51:12.625 --> 01:51:14.001
Always.

1311
01:51:19.549 --> 01:51:22.009
I'm not gonna end your life for you.

1312
01:51:22.093 --> 01:51:25.179
I'm dying already.

1313
01:51:26.639 --> 01:51:28.516
Every second, I get closer.

1314
01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.479
- Older.
- That's the way it's supposed to be.

1315
01:51:34.772 --> 01:51:37.233
Alice said that she saw me like you.

1316
01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:39.652
- I heard her.
- Her visions change.

1317
01:51:39.735 --> 01:51:41.988
Yeah, based on what people decide.

1318
01:51:42.989 --> 01:51:43.990
I've decided.

1319
01:51:47.952 --> 01:51:51.956
So that's what you dream about.
Becoming a monster.

1320
01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:58.045
I dream about being with you forever.

1321
01:51:59.046 --> 01:52:00.590
Forever?

1322
01:52:05.303 --> 01:52:07.430
And you're ready right now?

1323
01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:10.641
Yes.

1324
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:32.246
Is it not enough just to have a long
and happy life with me?

1325
01:52:39.837 --> 01:52:43.966
Yeah. For now.

1326
01:53:12.411 --> 01:53:17.291
No one will surrender tonight,
but I won't give in.

1327
01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:21.587
I know what I want.
