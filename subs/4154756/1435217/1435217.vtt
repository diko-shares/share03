1
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.407
This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.

2
00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:25.390
We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.

3
00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:28.429
Hundreds are dead,
sliced open...

4
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:33.172
Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...

5
00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:41.194
Our craft is made up of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.

6
00:00:41.218 --> 00:00:45.471
This is not a warcraft, I
repeat, this is not a warcraft.

7
00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:01.421
Hear me... and rejoice.

8
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:10.288
You have had the privilege, of
being saved by the Great Titan.

9
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:15.535
You may think this is suffering.

10
00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:20.231
No. It is salvation.

11
00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:30.588
Universal scales, tipped toward
balance because of your sacrifice.

12
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:36.274
Smile, for even in death,

13
00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:39.511
you have become
Children of Thanos.

14
00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:57.417
I know what it's like to lose.

15
00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:04.861
To feel so desperately that you're
right, yet to fail nonetheless.

16
00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:18.362
As lightning turns
the legs to jelly.

17
00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.493
I ask you, to what end?

18
00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:27.329
Dread it, run from it...

19
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.153
Destiny arrives all the same.

20
00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:35.458
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...

21
00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.489
I am.

22
00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:45.822
You talk too much.

23
00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:50.681
The Tesseract. Or,
your brother's head.

24
00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.336
I assume you have a preference?

25
00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:00.101
Oh, I do.

26
00:03:02.523 --> 00:03:03.858
Kill away.

27
00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:20.353
All right, stop!

28
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.680
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

29
00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:41.860
You really are the
worst, brother.

30
00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:50.392
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

31
00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:55.305
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

32
00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.636
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

33
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.098
And for another...

34
00:04:02.646 --> 00:04:04.630
we have a Hulk.

35
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.408
Let him have his fun.

36
00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:12.055
Allfathers...

37
00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:18.479
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

38
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:35.538
That was a mistake.

39
00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.229
No!

40
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.818
You are going to die for that!

41
00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.138
My humble personage...

42
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.779
bows before your grandeur.

43
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:33.068
No other being, has
ever had the might,

44
00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:40.427
nay, the nobility, to wield not
one, but two Infinity Stones.

45
00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:48.335
The Universe, lies
within your grasp.

46
00:07:27.002 --> 00:07:30.689
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

47
00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:34.992
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

48
00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:39.219
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

49
00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:43.352
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

50
00:07:43.376 --> 00:07:46.118
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

51
00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:51.282
- If you consider failure experience...
- I consider experience, experience.

52
00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:59.517
Almighty Thanos, I, Loki,
Prince of Asgard...

53
00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:05.110
Odinson...

54
00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:13.172
The rightful king of
Jotunheim, God of Mischief...

55
00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:20.766
Do hereby pledge to you,
my undying fidelity.

56
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:32.787
"Undying"?

57
00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:39.154
You should choose your
words more carefully.

58
00:08:59.888 --> 00:09:01.052
You...

59
00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:04.747
will never be...

60
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.872
a god.

61
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.859
No resurrections this time.

62
00:09:59.597 --> 00:10:02.417
No... Loki...

63
00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:43.849
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

64
00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:47.178
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

65
00:10:47.202 --> 00:10:49.171
I'll tell the guys at the deli.
Maybe they'll

66
00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:51.163
make you a metaphysical
Ham and Rye.

67
00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:53.700
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?

68
00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:55.670
- Rupees.
- Which is?

69
00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:01.539
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.

70
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:15.491
Thanos is coming.

71
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:17.670
We've got to...

72
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:22.887
Who?

73
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:33.896
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.

74
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.440
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.

75
00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:38.510
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

76
00:11:38.534 --> 00:11:39.899
Yeah.

77
00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:41.287
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,

78
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.831
what am I gonna do?
Someone's watching!

79
00:11:42.855 --> 00:11:45.736
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

80
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.103
- Yes.
- Yeah.

81
00:11:47.127 --> 00:11:48.846
Everybody has that.

82
00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:50.588
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

83
00:11:50.604 --> 00:11:54.431
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.

84
00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:58.127
So real. We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

85
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.119
- What was his name? Morgan.
- Right.

86
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.028
So you woke up, and we were...

87
00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:06.302
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

88
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.218
- Yes?
- No.

89
00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:10.710
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

90
00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:12.764
You wouldn't have done that.

91
00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:16.703
I'm glad you brought this up. It's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

92
00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.447
- It's not helping your case. Ok?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...

93
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.034
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.

94
00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:25.108
I'm just trying to protect us. The
future, as is, and that's it.

95
00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:27.826
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.

96
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.437
Shirts.

97
00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:32.256
You know me so well.

98
00:12:32.655 --> 00:12:37.639
- You finish all my sentences.
- You should have shirts in your closet.

99
00:12:37.663 --> 00:12:40.431
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

100
00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:43.369
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.

101
00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:48.652
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

102
00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:50.332
- Yes.
- I will.

103
00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:58.792
Tony Stark, I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

104
00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:02.558
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

105
00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.465
I'm sorry. You giving out
tickets or something?

106
00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:06.371
We need your help.

107
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.010
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

108
00:13:10.027 --> 00:13:12.565
And who's "we"?

109
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.034
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

110
00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:22.377
You okay?

111
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:29.376
From the dawn of the Universe,
there was nothing. Then, boom!

112
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.599
The Big Bang sends six elemental crystals,
hurdling across the virgin Universe.

113
00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:42.278
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

114
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.489
Space.

115
00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:47.028
Reality.

116
00:13:48.082 --> 00:13:49.652
Power.

117
00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.855
Soul.

118
00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:54.473
Mind.

119
00:13:55.872 --> 00:13:57.879
And Time.

120
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:09.400
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

121
00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:12.838
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

122
00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:16.744
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

123
00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:20.174
The attack on New York.
That's him.

124
00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.178
- What's our timeline?
- No telling.

125
00:14:25.186 --> 00:14:29.530
He has the Power and Space Stones, making
him the strongest creature in the Universe.

126
00:14:29.554 --> 00:14:32.454
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...

127
00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:36.360
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundreth of.

128
00:14:36.384 --> 00:14:38.384
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

129
00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:40.767
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

130
00:14:40.791 --> 00:14:42.268
Is that what that is?

131
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:46.650
I'm going to allow that.

132
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.107
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just
stick this one down the garbage disposal?

133
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:54.163
No can do.

134
00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:56.219
We swore an oath to protect the
Time Stone with our lives.

135
00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:59.593
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

136
00:14:59.602 --> 00:15:01.382
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

137
00:15:01.406 --> 00:15:03.019
A bit chalky.

138
00:15:03.031 --> 00:15:04.656
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

139
00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:07.343
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

140
00:15:07.352 --> 00:15:10.024
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

141
00:15:10.032 --> 00:15:12.383
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

142
00:15:12.392 --> 00:15:15.299
Conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

143
00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:16.969
Only if we don't do our jobs.

144
00:15:16.993 --> 00:15:20.118
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

145
00:15:20.474 --> 00:15:23.247
Protecting your
reality, douchebag.

146
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:26.412
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?

147
00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:29.810
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.

148
00:15:29.827 --> 00:15:34.756
Vision is out there with the Mind Stone.
And we have to find him now.

149
00:15:34.772 --> 00:15:37.420
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

150
00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:40.881
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

151
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.069
What?

152
00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.866
- Tony, you lost another superbot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

153
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.788
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

154
00:15:53.012 --> 00:15:55.613
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

155
00:15:55.637 --> 00:15:58.410
Maybe. But...

156
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.575
Call him.

157
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.535
It's not that easy.

158
00:16:06.075 --> 00:16:11.466
God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have
we? The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

159
00:16:11.614 --> 00:16:13.207
Broke up?

160
00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:18.973
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

161
00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:21.801
We're not on speaking terms.

162
00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:25.098
Tony, listen to me.

163
00:16:25.802 --> 00:16:28.129
Thor's gone.

164
00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:32.684
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

165
00:17:10.914 --> 00:17:14.467
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

166
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:16.913
Not at the moment, no.

167
00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:50.507
You okay?

168
00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.001
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

169
00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:58.033
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

170
00:17:58.057 --> 00:18:01.479
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

171
00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:03.400
I might wanna use it.

172
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.932
Ned, hey. I need you to
cause a distraction.

173
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.986
Holy shit!

174
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.470
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

175
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:50.922
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?

176
00:19:02.378 --> 00:19:06.424
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.

177
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.604
Will do.

178
00:19:35.658 --> 00:19:39.095
Hear me, and rejoice!

179
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.252
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

180
00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:49.173
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...

181
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.220
I'm sorry, Earth
is closed today.

182
00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:56.579
- You better pack it up and get outta here.
- Stonekeeper...

183
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.293
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

184
00:19:59.317 --> 00:20:02.035
Certainly not. I speak for myself.
There's no

185
00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:04.777
trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

186
00:20:04.965 --> 00:20:08.441
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

187
00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:10.269
Bring me the Stone.

188
00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:13.660
Hey, do you want a piece?

189
00:20:14.402 --> 00:20:17.941
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

190
00:20:20.113 --> 00:20:23.659
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.

191
00:20:24.126 --> 00:20:27.511
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.

192
00:20:27.535 --> 00:20:29.493
Come on, come on, Max.

193
00:20:32.162 --> 00:20:34.372
Where's your guy?

194
00:20:34.842 --> 00:20:36.616
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.

195
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.265
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.

196
00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:49.071
Dude, you're embarassing me
in front of the wizards.

197
00:20:49.095 --> 00:20:51.564
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

198
00:20:51.588 --> 00:20:53.830
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.

199
00:21:22.292 --> 00:21:26.892
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...

200
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:33.534
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

201
00:21:42.482 --> 00:21:45.592
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

202
00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.248
Exactly. Bye!

203
00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:59.016
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

204
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.234
- Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
- I'm trying. He won't come out.

205
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.819
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing?

206
00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:18.225
Come on. Come on! Come on!

207
00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:20.686
No!

208
00:22:24.249 --> 00:22:27.163
What do you mean, "no"?

209
00:22:31.898 --> 00:22:35.046
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

210
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.265
The field trip.

211
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.956
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?

212
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.581
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

213
00:23:10.731 --> 00:23:15.426
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

214
00:23:17.254 --> 00:23:19.693
It's a simple spell but
quite unbreakable.

215
00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:22.155
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

216
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:39.971
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.

217
00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:42.369
You'll only wish you were dead.

218
00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:53.410
No!

219
00:23:56.785 --> 00:23:59.378
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

220
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:09.880
Not cool.

221
00:24:24.014 --> 00:24:28.904
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

222
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:50.857
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

223
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.618
Give me a little juice, Friday.

224
00:25:07.534 --> 00:25:09.713
Unlock 17-A.

225
00:25:21.938 --> 00:25:24.180
Kid, you gotta let go.
i'm gonna catch you.

226
00:25:24.192 --> 00:25:26.445
But you said save the wizard!

227
00:25:26.469 --> 00:25:28.244
I can't breathe!

228
00:25:28.268 --> 00:25:31.008
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.

229
00:25:32.172 --> 00:25:34.429
That makes sense.

230
00:25:50.537 --> 00:25:52.814
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

231
00:25:52.838 --> 00:25:56.111
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

232
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:57.728
Oh, come on!

233
00:26:05.652 --> 00:26:07.950
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

234
00:26:07.974 --> 00:26:10.475
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

235
00:26:10.499 --> 00:26:13.505
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

236
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:15.739
Why?

237
00:26:15.751 --> 00:26:17.981
Just 'cause I'll probably not
make it back for awhile.

238
00:26:18.404 --> 00:26:20.787
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

239
00:26:20.811 --> 00:26:22.678
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

240
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.568
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

241
00:26:24.584 --> 00:26:27.959
- I don't know how to say this. Pep...
- Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...

242
00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:30.247
Come back!

243
00:26:30.248 --> 00:26:34.794
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

244
00:26:43.287 --> 00:26:45.568
Oh, my God.

245
00:26:48.975 --> 00:26:51.780
I should have stayed on the bus.

246
00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:08.696
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.

247
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.508
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?

248
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.121
I'm gonna make a call.

249
00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:57.287
Sing it, Drax!

250
00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:10.654
Why are we doing this again?

251
00:28:10.678 --> 00:28:13.374
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

252
00:28:13.398 --> 00:28:17.381
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

253
00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:20.545
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

254
00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:23.945
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

255
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:26.105
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

256
00:28:26.129 --> 00:28:30.078
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!

257
00:28:32.124 --> 00:28:34.258
We are arriving.

258
00:28:34.282 --> 00:28:36.722
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

259
00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:39.186
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

260
00:28:43.965 --> 00:28:47.781
Groot, put that thing away. Now. I
don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

261
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.461
I am Groot!

262
00:28:49.485 --> 00:28:51.767
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!

263
00:28:51.791 --> 00:28:53.611
You got some acorns on you, kid.

264
00:28:53.635 --> 00:28:57.127
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

265
00:28:57.151 --> 00:29:00.854
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

266
00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:10.299
What happened?

267
00:29:12.689 --> 00:29:15.079
Oh, my God.

268
00:29:20.001 --> 00:29:22.532
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

269
00:29:24.243 --> 00:29:27.586
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

270
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.964
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

271
00:29:36.988 --> 00:29:40.613
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

272
00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:44.277
This... This is a man.

273
00:29:44.301 --> 00:29:47.926
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

274
00:29:47.934 --> 00:29:50.926
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

275
00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:55.003
- Yeah, right.
- It's true. You have little weight...

276
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:58.964
Gamora, do you think I'm...

277
00:30:01.113 --> 00:30:08.214
He is anxious. Angry. He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

278
00:30:08.404 --> 00:30:11.397
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

279
00:30:11.421 --> 00:30:14.188
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

280
00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:18.454
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

281
00:30:18.462 --> 00:30:20.022
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

282
00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:22.921
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fibre.

283
00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:25.819
Stop massaging his muscles.

284
00:30:27.024 --> 00:30:28.859
Wake him up.

285
00:30:30.847 --> 00:30:32.090
Wake.

286
00:30:49.492 --> 00:30:52.132
Who the hell are you guys?

287
00:30:54.398 --> 00:30:58.265
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

288
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:02.069
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

289
00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:07.148
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

290
00:31:07.164 --> 00:31:10.554
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

291
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.477
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

292
00:31:13.501 --> 00:31:17.235
You seem to know a great
deal about Thanos.

293
00:31:17.247 --> 00:31:20.993
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

294
00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:27.941
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

295
00:31:27.965 --> 00:31:32.629
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.

296
00:31:35.155 --> 00:31:40.406
Thanos can be tough. Before my father
died, he told me I had a half-sister...

297
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.348
that he imprisoned in Hel.
Then she returned

298
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.289
home, and stabbed me
in the eye, so...

299
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:55.175
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

300
00:31:55.199 --> 00:31:57.755
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

301
00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:02.810
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

302
00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:05.775
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

303
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:09.033
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

304
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:11.806
I need a hammer, not a spoon...

305
00:32:12.362 --> 00:32:17.863
How do I open this thing? Is there some
sort of a four-digit code maybe...

306
00:32:17.887 --> 00:32:20.878
- Maybe a birthdate or something...
- What are you doing?

307
00:32:20.879 --> 00:32:25.426
- Taking your pod.
- No, you're not!

308
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.500
You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.

309
00:32:32.032 --> 00:32:37.008
- Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
- No.

310
00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:41.066
You are. You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

311
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.401
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

312
00:32:43.425 --> 00:32:46.379
This is my voice!

313
00:32:50.461 --> 00:32:53.665
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

314
00:32:53.689 --> 00:32:55.790
You just did it again.

315
00:32:55.814 --> 00:32:57.861
He's trying to copy me.

316
00:32:57.885 --> 00:33:01.244
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.

317
00:33:01.268 --> 00:33:03.127
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

318
00:33:03.139 --> 00:33:05.010
Knowhere.

319
00:33:05.276 --> 00:33:09.861
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Knowhere? It's a place.

320
00:33:09.877 --> 00:33:13.393
We've been there. It sucks.
Excuse me, that's our food.

321
00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:15.699
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

322
00:33:15.723 --> 00:33:17.938
For years, the Reality
Stone has been safely

323
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.177
stored there with a man
called The Collector.

324
00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:23.982
If it's with the Collector, it's not safe.
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

325
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.888
Or a genius.

326
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.810
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

327
00:33:27.943 --> 00:33:30.771
There's six stones out there.

328
00:33:30.787 --> 00:33:34.632
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

329
00:33:34.656 --> 00:33:38.900
when he decimated Xandar. He
stole the Space Stone from me.

330
00:33:38.915 --> 00:33:41.861
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

331
00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:44.870
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

332
00:33:44.894 --> 00:33:47.216
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

333
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.892
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

334
00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.190
Haven't been there in a while.

335
00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:55.292
As for the Soul Stone, no one's ever seen
that. No one even knows where it is.

336
00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:58.823
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Knowhere.

337
00:33:58.832 --> 00:34:02.245
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

338
00:34:02.261 --> 00:34:05.276
- Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
- Wrong.

339
00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:08.888
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

340
00:34:08.912 --> 00:34:12.951
- Your word is made up.
- Vanadellir is real? Seriously?

341
00:34:13.335 --> 00:34:15.882
That place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

342
00:34:15.894 --> 00:34:18.452
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

343
00:34:18.476 --> 00:34:20.627
I would very much like
to go there, please.

344
00:34:20.651 --> 00:34:22.151
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

345
00:34:22.163 --> 00:34:23.674
Rabbit?

346
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.760
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

347
00:34:26.784 --> 00:34:29.203
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

348
00:34:29.227 --> 00:34:32.446
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

349
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.298
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

350
00:34:36.314 --> 00:34:38.892
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

351
00:34:38.916 --> 00:34:40.447
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

352
00:34:40.471 --> 00:34:43.048
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

353
00:34:43.064 --> 00:34:44.782
And I'm not going to...

354
00:34:45.774 --> 00:34:48.188
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

355
00:34:48.197 --> 00:34:50.205
The Thanos killing kind.

356
00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:52.075
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

357
00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:54.270
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

358
00:34:54.287 --> 00:34:56.830
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.

359
00:34:56.854 --> 00:34:58.226
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

360
00:34:58.238 --> 00:34:59.621
A little bit. Yeah.

361
00:34:59.645 --> 00:35:02.973
If we don't go to Knowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

362
00:35:02.997 --> 00:35:05.543
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

363
00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:07.355
I got it figured out.

364
00:35:07.379 --> 00:35:10.871
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.

365
00:35:10.888 --> 00:35:13.196
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

366
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.540
and the morons will go to
Knowhere to try and stop Thanos.

367
00:35:16.868 --> 00:35:19.134
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

368
00:35:19.158 --> 00:35:20.930
For the record...

369
00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:23.754
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

370
00:35:23.778 --> 00:35:28.129
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

371
00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:32.869
Come on, Groot. Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

372
00:35:36.452 --> 00:35:40.717
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

373
00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.947
Vis?

374
00:35:57.163 --> 00:35:58.921
Is it the stone again?

375
00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:01.204
It's as if it's speaking to me.

376
00:36:01.455 --> 00:36:03.447
What does it say?

377
00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:07.385
I don't... I don't know.
Something...

378
00:36:19.737 --> 00:36:22.112
Tell me what you feel.

379
00:36:29.225 --> 00:36:32.591
I just feel you.

380
00:36:39.956 --> 00:36:44.260
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us
more time together before you went back.

381
00:36:44.284 --> 00:36:47.283
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

382
00:36:47.307 --> 00:36:50.057
What if I missed all the trains?

383
00:36:50.956 --> 00:36:53.050
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

384
00:36:53.074 --> 00:36:55.700
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

385
00:36:55.724 --> 00:36:59.169
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.

386
00:36:59.177 --> 00:37:00.864
Not to each other.

387
00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:03.145
Wanda...

388
00:37:03.296 --> 00:37:07.085
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.

389
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:11.671
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

390
00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:16.187
- I, I... I think... It woks.
- It works. It works.

391
00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:20.429
Stay.

392
00:37:27.387 --> 00:37:30.582
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

393
00:37:37.558 --> 00:37:39.620
What are they?

394
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.917
What the stone was
warning me about.

395
00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:56.685
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...

396
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:59.795
Then maybe going
isn't the best idea.

397
00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:01.975
Wanda, I...

398
00:38:31.522 --> 00:38:34.849
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

399
00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:38.633
- Is that even possibe?
- It isn't supposed to be.

400
00:38:46.071 --> 00:38:47.555
Vis!

401
00:38:56.203 --> 00:39:00.265
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

402
00:39:37.482 --> 00:39:38.958
Hands off.

403
00:39:55.996 --> 00:39:59.988
Come on. You gotta get up.
Get up. Come on.

404
00:40:01.675 --> 00:40:04.057
We have to go.

405
00:40:05.894 --> 00:40:09.385
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

406
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.550
I'm staying.

407
00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:24.584
- Get up.
- I can't.

408
00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:27.428
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

409
00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:30.530
You'll never get
the chance again.

410
00:41:45.487 --> 00:41:47.190
Can you stand?

411
00:41:51.947 --> 00:41:54.775
Thank you, Captain.

412
00:41:56.088 --> 00:41:58.486
Let's get you on the jet.

413
00:42:01.713 --> 00:42:04.885
I thought we had a deal.

414
00:42:04.909 --> 00:42:08.838
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

415
00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:12.869
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

416
00:42:15.057 --> 00:42:17.151
Where to, Cap?

417
00:42:19.284 --> 00:42:20.924
Home.

418
00:42:23.955 --> 00:42:26.173
We'll be safe.

419
00:42:50.709 --> 00:42:53.405
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!

420
00:42:53.429 --> 00:42:56.702
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!

421
00:42:57.193 --> 00:43:02.294
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...

422
00:43:03.341 --> 00:43:05.645
What's wrong, little one?

423
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:09.637
My mother. Where is my mother?

424
00:43:13.433 --> 00:43:15.671
What's your name?

425
00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:18.187
Gamora.

426
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.640
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

427
00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:25.936
Come. Let me help you.

428
00:43:37.765 --> 00:43:39.655
Look.

429
00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:46.741
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

430
00:43:46.765 --> 00:43:48.882
As all things should be.

431
00:43:48.906 --> 00:43:53.850
Too much to one side,
or the other...

432
00:43:56.151 --> 00:44:00.072
Here. You try.

433
00:44:03.122 --> 00:44:07.528
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

434
00:44:11.322 --> 00:44:13.860
Concentrate.

435
00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:19.984
There! You've got it.

436
00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:29.872
Gamora.

437
00:44:30.505 --> 00:44:34.341
Do you know if these grenades are the
blow off your junk kind or the gas kind?

438
00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:37.043
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

439
00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:40.090
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

440
00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:42.020
Yeah, sure.

441
00:44:42.934 --> 00:44:46.867
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

442
00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:50.793
Which is what the
grenades are for.

443
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.442
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

444
00:44:55.075 --> 00:44:57.614
If things go wrong...

445
00:44:57.903 --> 00:45:00.473
If Thanos gets me...

446
00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:09.114
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

447
00:45:09.138 --> 00:45:10.849
What?

448
00:45:13.498 --> 00:45:16.466
I know something he doesn't.

449
00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:20.639
If he finds it out...

450
00:45:20.663 --> 00:45:23.959
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

451
00:45:23.983 --> 00:45:26.889
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

452
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:32.598
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

453
00:45:32.622 --> 00:45:34.653
Only if you wanna die.

454
00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.707
Why does somebody always have
to die in this scenario?

455
00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:38.161
Just...

456
00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:43.169
trust me. And possibly, kill me.

457
00:45:43.193 --> 00:45:47.505
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

458
00:45:47.653 --> 00:45:49.864
Swear to me.

459
00:45:52.434 --> 00:45:55.319
Swear to me on your mother.

460
00:46:01.928 --> 00:46:03.740
Okay.

461
00:46:26.499 --> 00:46:29.241
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

462
00:46:29.265 --> 00:46:32.038
- An hour.
- An hour?

463
00:46:32.062 --> 00:46:33.725
Are you serious?

464
00:46:33.742 --> 00:46:39.546
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

465
00:46:39.937 --> 00:46:44.545
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

466
00:46:47.926 --> 00:46:52.003
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...

467
00:46:52.129 --> 00:46:54.449
So slow...

468
00:46:54.473 --> 00:46:58.792
- And it's imperceptible.
- No.

469
00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.730
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

470
00:47:04.144 --> 00:47:05.808
Damn it.

471
00:47:24.962 --> 00:47:28.579
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

472
00:47:28.603 --> 00:47:32.345
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

473
00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:36.057
Let's put it down over here.

474
00:48:04.712 --> 00:48:08.458
I know you have the Reality Stone.
Giving it to

475
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.227
me will spare you a great
deal of suffering.

476
00:48:15.027 --> 00:48:19.237
I told you. I sold it.

477
00:48:21.171 --> 00:48:26.405
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

478
00:48:26.819 --> 00:48:30.725
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

479
00:48:30.749 --> 00:48:33.600
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

480
00:48:33.624 --> 00:48:35.756
I didn't know what it was.

481
00:48:35.764 --> 00:48:38.897
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

482
00:48:38.905 --> 00:48:41.959
Last chance, Charlotte.

483
00:48:42.769 --> 00:48:44.769
Where's the Stone?

484
00:48:44.886 --> 00:48:49.878
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

485
00:48:49.902 --> 00:48:51.518
Drax, wait!

486
00:48:52.027 --> 00:48:54.261
Whoa, not yet!

487
00:49:00.916 --> 00:49:03.736
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

488
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.081
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

489
00:49:06.105 --> 00:49:08.995
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

490
00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:14.386
No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.

491
00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.292
Sleep.

492
00:49:27.516 --> 00:49:32.734
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

493
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.054
I'm... The other right!

494
00:49:59.332 --> 00:50:01.910
Why?

495
00:50:10.886 --> 00:50:15.339
Why you? Daughter...

496
00:50:33.816 --> 00:50:36.003
That was quick.

497
00:50:40.539 --> 00:50:45.976
Magnificent! Magnificent!

498
00:50:47.843 --> 00:50:51.484
Is it sadness I sense
in you, daughter?

499
00:50:53.656 --> 00:50:57.281
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.

500
00:51:03.487 --> 00:51:06.666
No one ever knows for sure.

501
00:51:16.043 --> 00:51:19.629
Reality is often disappointing.

502
00:51:22.092 --> 00:51:25.334
That is, it was.

503
00:51:26.326 --> 00:51:27.912
Now...

504
00:51:29.761 --> 00:51:33.214
Reality can be whatever I want.

505
00:51:33.878 --> 00:51:37.479
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

506
00:51:37.905 --> 00:51:41.733
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

507
00:51:45.521 --> 00:51:47.536
Thanos!

508
00:52:00.466 --> 00:52:04.192
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

509
00:52:04.873 --> 00:52:07.731
- I told you to go right.
- Now...

510
00:52:07.755 --> 00:52:12.247
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

511
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:17.168
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.

512
00:52:17.192 --> 00:52:19.153
- Let her go.
- Peter...

513
00:52:19.177 --> 00:52:23.825
Or I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face!

514
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:27.145
Not him.

515
00:52:36.328 --> 00:52:39.257
You promised!

516
00:52:44.385 --> 00:52:48.814
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

517
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:55.038
She's asked, hasn't she?

518
00:52:57.539 --> 00:52:59.116
Do it.

519
00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:06.686
Do it!

520
00:53:13.264 --> 00:53:15.889
I told you to go right!

521
00:53:16.585 --> 00:53:19.756
I love you, more than anything.

522
00:53:22.662 --> 00:53:25.304
I love you, too.

523
00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.219
I like you.

524
00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.055
Still no word from Vision?

525
00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:14.735
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

526
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:18.719
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

527
00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:22.166
They're only criminals because you've
chosen to call them that, right, sir?

528
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:26.605
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

529
00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:30.072
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

530
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.580
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

531
00:54:33.822 --> 00:54:38.838
That's right. And I'm pretty
sure I've paid for that.

532
00:54:38.862 --> 00:54:42.166
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

533
00:54:47.812 --> 00:54:51.085
Mr. Secretary.

534
00:54:53.758 --> 00:54:57.476
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

535
00:54:57.932 --> 00:55:00.445
You could use some
of that right now.

536
00:55:00.578 --> 00:55:03.531
The world's on fire.

537
00:55:03.555 --> 00:55:07.203
And you think, all is forgiven?

538
00:55:07.227 --> 00:55:11.992
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.

539
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:18.093
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

540
00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:21.015
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

541
00:55:21.602 --> 00:55:23.758
We'll fight you, too.

542
00:55:26.817 --> 00:55:30.379
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

543
00:55:35.535 --> 00:55:37.745
That's a court-martial.

544
00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:43.208
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

545
00:55:43.232 --> 00:55:44.561
Hey.

546
00:55:46.302 --> 00:55:50.903
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

547
00:55:50.927 --> 00:55:52.692
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

548
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:55.840
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

549
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:58.153
I think you look great.

550
00:56:04.979 --> 00:56:07.314
Yeah. I'm back.

551
00:56:08.588 --> 00:56:10.197
Hi, Bruce.

552
00:56:15.115 --> 00:56:16.693
Nat.

553
00:56:19.513 --> 00:56:22.083
This is awkward.

554
00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:25.157
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

555
00:56:25.169 --> 00:56:26.790
And they can clearly find us.

556
00:56:26.805 --> 00:56:29.234
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

557
00:56:29.242 --> 00:56:31.586
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

558
00:56:31.598 --> 00:56:33.953
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.

559
00:56:33.977 --> 00:56:35.523
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

560
00:56:35.547 --> 00:56:37.945
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

561
00:56:37.969 --> 00:56:38.969
Okay, look...

562
00:56:38.992 --> 00:56:41.992
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

563
00:56:42.008 --> 00:56:45.952
And he is not gonna stop until he...
He gets...

564
00:56:47.643 --> 00:56:48.651
Vision's stone.

565
00:56:48.675 --> 00:56:52.627
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

566
00:56:53.968 --> 00:56:58.421
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

567
00:56:58.437 --> 00:57:00.721
But also, its composition.

568
00:57:00.745 --> 00:57:03.101
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

569
00:57:03.113 --> 00:57:05.480
powerful energy
source, something,

570
00:57:05.504 --> 00:57:09.269
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

571
00:57:10.277 --> 00:57:13.199
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

572
00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:15.722
And you, with it.

573
00:57:15.746 --> 00:57:17.863
We're not having
this conversation.

574
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:20.004
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that.

575
00:57:20.028 --> 00:57:24.596
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

576
00:57:28.532 --> 00:57:32.063
Only you, have the
power to pay it.

577
00:57:35.212 --> 00:57:37.355
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

578
00:57:37.379 --> 00:57:39.662
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

579
00:57:39.674 --> 00:57:41.969
But it should.

580
00:57:43.774 --> 00:57:45.206
We don't trade lives, Vision.

581
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:49.589
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.

582
00:57:49.613 --> 00:57:51.729
Tell me, why is
this any different?

583
00:57:51.753 --> 00:57:55.089
Because you might have a choice.

584
00:57:55.355 --> 00:57:59.401
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

585
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:03.161
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

586
00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:06.980
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

587
00:58:07.004 --> 00:58:10.175
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...

588
00:58:10.199 --> 00:58:13.909
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

589
00:58:13.918 --> 00:58:17.105
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

590
00:58:17.424 --> 00:58:19.158
Not me. Not here.

591
00:58:19.484 --> 00:58:22.520
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

592
00:58:22.544 --> 00:58:26.419
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

593
00:58:27.927 --> 00:58:30.637
I know somewhere.

594
00:58:44.345 --> 00:58:47.187
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

595
00:58:47.211 --> 00:58:49.031
And the Border Tribe?

596
00:58:49.055 --> 00:58:53.258
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.

597
00:58:53.282 --> 00:58:55.844
M'Baku likes a good fight.

598
00:58:57.227 --> 00:58:59.625
And what of this one?

599
00:58:59.874 --> 00:59:02.406
This one may be tired of war.

600
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:06.351
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

601
00:59:28.176 --> 00:59:29.926
Where's the fight?

602
00:59:30.606 --> 00:59:32.394
On its way.

603
00:59:50.547 --> 00:59:54.054
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

604
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:57.457
I have never failed him.

605
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.159
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

606
01:00:05.183 --> 01:00:08.941
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

607
01:00:08.965 --> 01:00:11.847
There would be judgement.

608
01:00:20.288 --> 01:00:22.209
Give me...

609
01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.022
the Stone.

610
01:00:39.377 --> 01:00:42.314
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.

611
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.431
Speaking of loyalty...

612
01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:47.524
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.

613
01:00:47.548 --> 01:00:48.548
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

614
01:00:48.564 --> 01:00:50.497
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about...

615
01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:52.454
And now I gotta hear it.

616
01:00:52.478 --> 01:00:55.610
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

617
01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:58.736
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

618
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.480
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

619
01:01:00.504 --> 01:01:02.501
And now I'm here in space.

620
01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:04.521
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

621
01:01:04.545 --> 01:01:06.721
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

622
01:01:06.733 --> 01:01:08.920
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

623
01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:12.189
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

624
01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:16.525
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

625
01:01:17.877 --> 01:01:21.423
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

626
01:01:23.078 --> 01:01:26.121
Come on. We got a situation.

627
01:01:26.273 --> 01:01:29.804
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

628
01:01:30.328 --> 01:01:32.155
Okay, okay.

629
01:01:32.468 --> 01:01:35.296
Ok, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

630
01:01:38.764 --> 01:01:41.483
Painful, aren't they?

631
01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:45.303
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

632
01:01:45.427 --> 01:01:47.645
And any one of them...

633
01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.129
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.

634
01:01:55.153 --> 01:01:57.270
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

635
01:01:57.278 --> 01:02:00.879
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

636
01:02:01.598 --> 01:02:03.450
You've saved nothing.

637
01:02:04.411 --> 01:02:08.004
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

638
01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.676
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

639
01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:24.585
Yes!

640
01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:27.108
Wait, what are those?

641
01:02:41.518 --> 01:02:43.893
Hey, we haven't officially met.

642
01:02:44.596 --> 01:02:45.729
Cool.

643
01:02:47.283 --> 01:02:51.142
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

644
01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.973
- Great plan.
- I want to protect the stone.

645
01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:55.770
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

646
01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:58.754
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?

647
01:02:58.763 --> 01:03:01.543
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

648
01:03:01.552 --> 01:03:03.992
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

649
01:03:04.016 --> 01:03:06.138
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

650
01:03:06.146 --> 01:03:07.967
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

651
01:03:07.991 --> 01:03:10.225
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

652
01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:13.906
And due to that fact, we're now in a flying
donut, billions of miles from Earth,

653
01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.345
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

654
01:03:15.369 --> 01:03:18.348
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

655
01:03:18.372 --> 01:03:22.614
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

656
01:03:22.638 --> 01:03:26.349
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

657
01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:28.795
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.

658
01:03:28.819 --> 01:03:30.631
I'm Spider-Man, then.

659
01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.609
The ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

660
01:03:33.633 --> 01:03:37.217
Can we control it? Fly us home?

661
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:41.565
- Stark.
- Yeah?

662
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:44.370
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.

663
01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.651
I'm not so sure we should.

664
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:53.002
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

665
01:03:53.026 --> 01:03:55.589
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

666
01:03:55.613 --> 01:03:58.066
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

667
01:03:58.078 --> 01:04:00.542
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

668
01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:03.910
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

669
01:04:03.934 --> 01:04:06.004
And I don't know what to do.

670
01:04:06.163 --> 01:04:09.641
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

671
01:04:09.665 --> 01:04:13.094
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.

672
01:04:13.215 --> 01:04:15.758
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.

673
01:04:15.782 --> 01:04:19.854
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

674
01:04:21.212 --> 01:04:23.344
Do you concur?

675
01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.604
All right, Stark. We go to him.

676
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.057
But you have to understand...

677
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:35.761
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...

678
01:04:35.785 --> 01:04:39.381
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

679
01:04:39.405 --> 01:04:43.562
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.

680
01:04:43.586 --> 01:04:47.062
Nice. Good. Moral compass.

681
01:04:49.912 --> 01:04:52.630
All right, kid...

682
01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:56.129
You're an Avenger now.

683
01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.430
I thought you might be hungry.

684
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.391
I always hated that chair.

685
01:05:47.406 --> 01:05:49.204
So I've been told.

686
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.855
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

687
01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:58.069
I hated this room, this ship...

688
01:05:58.215 --> 01:06:00.879
I hated my life.

689
01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:06.876
You told me that, too.

690
01:06:09.775 --> 01:06:12.017
Everyday.

691
01:06:13.982 --> 01:06:16.700
For almost twenty years.

692
01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:20.681
I was a child when you took me.

693
01:06:21.828 --> 01:06:24.203
I saved you.

694
01:06:25.656 --> 01:06:29.086
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

695
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:32.977
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

696
01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:37.891
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

697
01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:40.500
You know what's
happened since then?

698
01:06:40.524 --> 01:06:44.348
The children born, have
known nothing but full

699
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.195
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

700
01:06:49.775 --> 01:06:52.190
Because you murdered
half the planet.

701
01:06:52.214 --> 01:06:54.995
A small price to
pay for salvation.

702
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:58.410
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

703
01:06:58.434 --> 01:07:01.645
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

704
01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:05.903
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

705
01:07:06.174 --> 01:07:10.166
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

706
01:07:10.338 --> 01:07:13.213
I'm the only one who knows that.

707
01:07:13.221 --> 01:07:17.908
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

708
01:07:19.183 --> 01:07:21.854
For a time...

709
01:07:22.558 --> 01:07:23.698
You...

710
01:07:24.987 --> 01:07:32.886
had that same will, as you
fought by my side, daughter.

711
01:07:33.522 --> 01:07:36.279
I'm not your daughter.

712
01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:40.959
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.

713
01:07:41.163 --> 01:07:45.663
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

714
01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:51.451
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

715
01:07:54.014 --> 01:07:57.474
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

716
01:07:57.959 --> 01:08:03.006
I am disappointed. But not
because you didn't find it.

717
01:08:06.823 --> 01:08:09.362
But because you did.

718
01:08:09.934 --> 01:08:12.158
And you lied.

719
01:08:28.811 --> 01:08:30.514
Nebula!

720
01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.591
Don't do this.

721
01:08:38.719 --> 01:08:43.024
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

722
01:08:43.048 --> 01:08:46.453
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

723
01:08:46.951 --> 01:08:51.638
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

724
01:08:58.516 --> 01:09:01.656
Stop. Stop it.

725
01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:09.589
I swear to you, on my life...

726
01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:13.465
I never found the Soul Stone.

727
01:09:16.266 --> 01:09:17.798
Accessing memory files.

728
01:09:17.822 --> 01:09:19.665
You know what he's about to do.

729
01:09:19.681 --> 01:09:22.743
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

730
01:09:22.752 --> 01:09:26.854
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.

731
01:09:26.878 --> 01:09:30.980
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

732
01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:33.652
I burned it.

733
01:09:37.121 --> 01:09:39.941
You're strong.

734
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:42.800
Me...

735
01:09:44.652 --> 01:09:48.456
The generous... me...

736
01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:53.131
But I never taught you to lie.

737
01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:56.068
That's why you're so bad at it.

738
01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:02.256
Where is the Soul Stone?

739
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.591
Vormir.

740
01:10:38.853 --> 01:10:41.056
The stone is on Vormir.

741
01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:46.587
Show me.

742
01:10:48.072 --> 01:10:51.017
- I am Groot.
- Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking.

743
01:10:51.033 --> 01:10:54.423
What's there to see? What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

744
01:10:54.427 --> 01:10:55.928
I am Groot!

745
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.452
You can pour what's in
the cup out in space

746
01:10:57.476 --> 01:10:58.709
then go in the cup again.

747
01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:00.358
You speak Groot?

748
01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:02.006
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.

749
01:11:02.022 --> 01:11:05.131
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

750
01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:09.838
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

751
01:11:12.266 --> 01:11:16.930
It's the birthplace of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.

752
01:11:22.627 --> 01:11:25.971
Okay. Time to be a captain.

753
01:11:30.876 --> 01:11:34.844
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

754
01:11:35.267 --> 01:11:38.384
Well, he's been dead before.

755
01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:41.728
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

756
01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:45.634
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

757
01:11:45.965 --> 01:11:49.652
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

758
01:11:49.676 --> 01:11:53.355
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

759
01:11:55.525 --> 01:11:59.165
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?

760
01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:05.278
Absolutely! The rage and
vengeance, anger...

761
01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:08.126
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

762
01:12:08.138 --> 01:12:10.989
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.

763
01:12:11.177 --> 01:12:16.131
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about.
He's the toughest there is.

764
01:12:16.155 --> 01:12:18.351
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

765
01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:22.922
He's never fought me twice. I'm
getting a new hammer, don't forget.

766
01:12:22.946 --> 01:12:25.696
It better be some hammer.

767
01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:32.184
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

768
01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:34.255
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

769
01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.326
every one of them
would've rather killed me

770
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:37.976
but none succeeded.

771
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.968
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

772
01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:44.163
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards

773
01:12:44.187 --> 01:12:48.371
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

774
01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.208
And what if you're wrong?

775
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.145
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

776
01:12:57.527 --> 01:13:00.965
What more could I lose?

777
01:13:12.363 --> 01:13:16.823
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

778
01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:22.020
Okay.

779
01:13:22.942 --> 01:13:26.746
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

780
01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.310
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

781
01:13:29.334 --> 01:13:33.748
What's it look like? Some jerk
lost a bet with me in Contraxia.

782
01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:36.177
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

783
01:13:36.201 --> 01:13:39.724
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

784
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.818
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

785
01:13:50.452 --> 01:13:52.891
I would've washed that.

786
01:13:52.915 --> 01:13:58.657
The only way I could sneak it off
Contraxia was on my... Hey, we're here.

787
01:14:02.334 --> 01:14:05.826
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

788
01:14:06.963 --> 01:14:09.533
But it ain't the eye.

789
01:14:22.088 --> 01:14:26.876
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

790
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:30.423
And the rings are frozen.

791
01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:53.686
I hope these dwarves are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.

792
01:14:57.896 --> 01:15:01.387
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

793
01:15:01.403 --> 01:15:04.825
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

794
01:15:06.443 --> 01:15:10.692
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

795
01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:13.739
Did it look anything like that?

796
01:15:16.028 --> 01:15:20.340
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

797
01:15:23.777 --> 01:15:26.925
Eitri, wait! Stop!

798
01:15:29.484 --> 01:15:30.976
Thor?

799
01:15:33.276 --> 01:15:38.260
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

800
01:15:38.463 --> 01:15:44.355
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

801
01:15:45.883 --> 01:15:49.758
Eitri, what did you do?

802
01:16:02.364 --> 01:16:06.309
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

803
01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:10.082
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

804
01:16:12.113 --> 01:16:14.933
I made what he wanted.

805
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:20.324
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

806
01:16:24.268 --> 01:16:27.197
And he killed everyone anyway.

807
01:16:28.979 --> 01:16:31.510
All except me.

808
01:16:31.634 --> 01:16:34.916
"Your life is yours," he said.

809
01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:39.728
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

810
01:16:39.752 --> 01:16:42.463
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

811
01:16:42.783 --> 01:16:44.683
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

812
01:16:44.707 --> 01:16:48.862
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

813
01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:53.002
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

814
01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:59.190
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

815
01:17:38.463 --> 01:17:41.048
Mantis, listen very carefully.

816
01:17:41.057 --> 01:17:43.838
I need you to meet me on Titan.

817
01:17:49.889 --> 01:17:52.413
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.

818
01:17:52.437 --> 01:17:55.413
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

819
01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.928
Get your hand inside this.

820
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:04.974
Then, we got one big dodge, so
we gotta move at the same time.

821
01:18:09.741 --> 01:18:13.748
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

822
01:18:41.724 --> 01:18:43.747
You all right?

823
01:18:44.943 --> 01:18:47.536
That was close.

824
01:18:47.732 --> 01:18:49.583
I owe you one.

825
01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:53.933
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

826
01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:56.623
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

827
01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:59.367
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?

828
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:01.789
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

829
01:19:07.627 --> 01:19:09.455
Thanos!

830
01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:32.342
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

831
01:19:40.725 --> 01:19:43.834
Die, Blanket of Death!

832
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:52.349
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

833
01:19:52.967 --> 01:19:55.647
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

834
01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:57.028
Where is Gamora?

835
01:19:57.052 --> 01:19:59.787
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

836
01:19:59.811 --> 01:20:03.029
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

837
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:06.052
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

838
01:20:06.076 --> 01:20:09.793
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

839
01:20:09.817 --> 01:20:13.409
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

840
01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:14.881
She's right. You can't.

841
01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:16.353
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

842
01:20:16.377 --> 01:20:20.185
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beaat it out of Thanos myself!

843
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:22.543
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

844
01:20:22.559 --> 01:20:24.786
Let me ask you this one time...

845
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:26.911
What master do you serve?

846
01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:30.388
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?

847
01:20:30.412 --> 01:20:32.652
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

848
01:20:32.676 --> 01:20:35.211
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

849
01:20:35.235 --> 01:20:39.804
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

850
01:20:39.928 --> 01:20:42.685
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

851
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:46.795
- He took my girl. Wait, who are you?
- We're the Avengers, man.

852
01:20:46.819 --> 01:20:50.881
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

853
01:20:50.905 --> 01:20:54.623
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.

854
01:20:54.787 --> 01:20:57.630
Where is he now?

855
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:13.121
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?

856
01:21:13.133 --> 01:21:14.996
It's a mould.

857
01:21:15.611 --> 01:21:19.932
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

858
01:21:20.526 --> 01:21:22.882
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

859
01:21:22.894 --> 01:21:25.261
Does it have a name?

860
01:21:26.069 --> 01:21:30.600
- Stormbreaker.
- It's a bit much.

861
01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:33.249
So how do we make it?

862
01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:40.580
You'll have to restart the forge.
Awaken the heart of the dying star.

863
01:21:41.921 --> 01:21:45.881
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

864
01:21:47.686 --> 01:21:50.226
What the hell happened
to this planet?

865
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:55.015
It's 8 degrees off its axis. Gravitational
pull is all over the place.

866
01:21:55.686 --> 01:21:59.389
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

867
01:21:59.413 --> 01:22:02.396
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

868
01:22:03.364 --> 01:22:06.434
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

869
01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:09.958
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

870
01:22:09.982 --> 01:22:14.614
Are you yawning? In the middle of
this, while I'm breaking it down?

871
01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:16.411
Did you hear what I said?

872
01:22:16.435 --> 01:22:19.060
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.

873
01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.818
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

874
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:22.592
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

875
01:22:22.616 --> 01:22:24.788
What exactly is it that they do?

876
01:22:24.812 --> 01:22:27.983
Kick names, take ass.

877
01:22:34.341 --> 01:22:38.773
All right, just get over here, please? Mr.
Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

878
01:22:38.797 --> 01:22:41.984
Star-Lord is fine.

879
01:22:43.142 --> 01:22:46.392
We've gotta coalesce. Because if all we
come at him with is a plucky attitude...

880
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.415
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

881
01:22:50.431 --> 01:22:54.291
All right, we're optmistic, yes. I
like your plan, except it sucks.

882
01:22:54.315 --> 01:22:57.730
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

883
01:22:57.754 --> 01:22:59.123
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

884
01:22:59.135 --> 01:23:00.515
What dance-off?

885
01:23:00.539 --> 01:23:03.598
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

886
01:23:03.622 --> 01:23:07.302
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

887
01:23:07.326 --> 01:23:09.044
It never was.

888
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:12.475
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?

889
01:23:12.499 --> 01:23:15.115
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

890
01:23:15.139 --> 01:23:18.240
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,

891
01:23:18.442 --> 01:23:21.412
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

892
01:23:21.436 --> 01:23:22.848
Excuse me?

893
01:23:23.505 --> 01:23:27.692
But does your friend
often do that?

894
01:23:28.161 --> 01:23:31.176
Strange! You all right?

895
01:23:40.711 --> 01:23:44.282
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?

896
01:23:44.306 --> 01:23:48.462
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...

897
01:23:48.767 --> 01:23:52.642
To see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.

898
01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:56.751
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

899
01:23:58.197 --> 01:24:01.017
How many did we win?

900
01:24:04.625 --> 01:24:06.117
One.

901
01:24:27.666 --> 01:24:30.924
The Stone had
better be up there.

902
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:36.010
For your sister's sake.

903
01:24:55.386 --> 01:25:00.792
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.

904
01:25:02.144 --> 01:25:05.581
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

905
01:25:05.705 --> 01:25:07.064
You know us?

906
01:25:07.088 --> 01:25:11.955
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

907
01:25:11.979 --> 01:25:14.401
Where is the Soul Stone?

908
01:25:14.425 --> 01:25:20.206
You should know, it
extracts a terrible price.

909
01:25:21.096 --> 01:25:23.666
I'm prepared.

910
01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:29.041
We all think that at first.

911
01:25:32.143 --> 01:25:35.158
We are all wrong.

912
01:25:45.929 --> 01:25:48.672
How is it you know
this place so well?

913
01:25:48.696 --> 01:25:53.297
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

914
01:25:53.321 --> 01:25:58.391
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

915
01:25:58.415 --> 01:26:00.633
Banished me here.

916
01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:04.891
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

917
01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:16.669
What you seek lies
in front of you.

918
01:26:16.826 --> 01:26:20.028
As does what you fear.

919
01:26:20.154 --> 01:26:23.567
- What's this?
- The price.

920
01:26:23.591 --> 01:26:28.497
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

921
01:26:29.158 --> 01:26:33.794
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.

922
01:26:34.829 --> 01:26:40.360
- Tell me what it needs.
- To ensure whoever possesses it,

923
01:26:40.384 --> 01:26:43.860
understands its power...

924
01:26:43.884 --> 01:26:47.835
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

925
01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:51.726
- Of what?
- In order to take the Stone...

926
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:55.085
You must lose that
which you love.

927
01:26:57.179 --> 01:27:01.718
A soul, for a soul.

928
01:27:16.182 --> 01:27:19.392
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

929
01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:21.924
a moment...

930
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:25.013
when you got what you deserved.

931
01:27:26.184 --> 01:27:29.723
And I was always
so disappointed.

932
01:27:32.129 --> 01:27:34.261
But, now...

933
01:27:37.496 --> 01:27:40.941
You kill, and torture,

934
01:27:42.543 --> 01:27:45.706
and you call it mercy.

935
01:27:48.488 --> 01:27:51.519
The Universe has judged you.

936
01:27:52.455 --> 01:27:57.962
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you, no.

937
01:27:58.533 --> 01:28:00.790
You failed.

938
01:28:01.346 --> 01:28:03.955
And do you wanna know why?

939
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:09.212
Because you love nothing.
No one.

940
01:28:19.402 --> 01:28:23.542
Really? Tears?

941
01:28:23.699 --> 01:28:26.089
They are not for him.

942
01:28:39.796 --> 01:28:41.874
No.

943
01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:45.022
This isn't love.

944
01:28:45.046 --> 01:28:48.530
I ignored my destiny once.

945
01:28:49.788 --> 01:28:56.664
I cannot do that again.
Even for you.

946
01:29:20.126 --> 01:29:22.977
I'm sorry, little one.

947
01:31:04.353 --> 01:31:07.774
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

948
01:31:07.798 --> 01:31:12.642
I hope you're right about this, or we're
gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

949
01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:30.629
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the

950
01:31:30.641 --> 01:31:33.262
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

951
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:35.247
What did you imagine?

952
01:31:35.271 --> 01:31:39.027
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

953
01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:55.909
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

954
01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:59.058
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

955
01:31:59.737 --> 01:32:03.613
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

956
01:32:03.637 --> 01:32:06.238
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

957
01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:08.863
Sir, you should expect
quite a big assault.

958
01:32:08.879 --> 01:32:11.660
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

959
01:32:11.684 --> 01:32:15.558
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

960
01:32:15.918 --> 01:32:19.527
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

961
01:32:21.645 --> 01:32:23.325
How have you been, Buck?

962
01:32:23.349 --> 01:32:26.813
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

963
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:41.975
The structure is polymorphic.

964
01:32:41.999 --> 01:32:45.163
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

965
01:32:45.179 --> 01:32:50.249
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work connectively?

966
01:32:50.358 --> 01:32:54.053
Because... we
didn't think of it?

967
01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:57.436
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

968
01:32:57.615 --> 01:33:01.013
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

969
01:33:01.037 --> 01:33:04.708
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

970
01:33:04.732 --> 01:33:08.334
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

971
01:33:08.358 --> 01:33:11.404
As long as you can give me.

972
01:33:14.444 --> 01:33:18.826
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

973
01:33:33.368 --> 01:33:35.930
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

974
01:33:45.103 --> 01:33:47.548
God, I love this place.

975
01:33:47.564 --> 01:33:52.219
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

976
01:34:10.213 --> 01:34:13.919
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

977
01:34:13.943 --> 01:34:17.543
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

978
01:34:17.545 --> 01:34:22.295
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

979
01:34:22.319 --> 01:34:23.411
I will.

980
01:34:23.435 --> 01:34:26.989
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

981
01:34:27.006 --> 01:34:30.497
and get this man a shield!

982
01:34:38.885 --> 01:34:41.520
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

983
01:34:41.544 --> 01:34:44.149
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

984
01:34:44.161 --> 01:34:46.778
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!

985
01:34:46.794 --> 01:34:48.911
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

986
01:34:48.919 --> 01:34:52.973
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...

987
01:35:00.403 --> 01:35:02.972
Fire the engines!

988
01:35:18.929 --> 01:35:22.405
More power, rabbit!

989
01:35:53.092 --> 01:35:55.552
Well done, boy.

990
01:35:56.186 --> 01:35:59.975
That's Nidavellir!

991
01:36:18.752 --> 01:36:21.799
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?

992
01:36:21.823 --> 01:36:23.885
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

993
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.123
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

994
01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:30.162
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

995
01:36:32.075 --> 01:36:34.740
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

996
01:36:34.764 --> 01:36:37.881
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

997
01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:50.656
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

998
01:36:53.053 --> 01:36:57.959
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...

999
01:37:00.782 --> 01:37:02.563
I'm okay.

1000
01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:08.023
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1001
01:37:34.956 --> 01:37:37.440
Thank you for standing with us.

1002
01:37:37.464 --> 01:37:39.448
Of course, brother.

1003
01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:01.576
Where's the other friend?

1004
01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.459
He will pay for his
life with yours.

1005
01:38:04.873 --> 01:38:07.771
Thanos will have that stone.

1006
01:38:07.795 --> 01:38:09.263
That's not gonna happen.

1007
01:38:09.287 --> 01:38:11.834
You are in Wakanda now.

1008
01:38:11.858 --> 01:38:16.357
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1009
01:38:16.483 --> 01:38:21.107
We, have blood to spare.

1010
01:38:31.857 --> 01:38:36.083
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

1011
01:38:46.104 --> 01:38:47.703
Yibambe!

1012
01:38:47.727 --> 01:38:48.939
Yibambe!

1013
01:38:49.065 --> 01:38:50.742
Yibambe!

1014
01:39:02.085 --> 01:39:04.873
What the hell?

1015
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:09.124
Looks like we pissed her off.

1016
01:39:19.055 --> 01:39:21.703
They're killing themselves.

1017
01:39:53.708 --> 01:39:55.817
See the teeth on those things?

1018
01:39:55.829 --> 01:39:57.950
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.

1019
01:40:09.805 --> 01:40:12.867
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1020
01:40:12.875 --> 01:40:16.753
- there's nothing between them and Vision.
- Then we better keep them in front of us.

1021
01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:19.173
How do we do that?

1022
01:40:20.421 --> 01:40:22.609
We open the barrier.

1023
01:40:24.221 --> 01:40:28.691
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1024
01:40:28.715 --> 01:40:30.994
Requesting
confirmation, my King.

1025
01:40:31.004 --> 01:40:32.886
You said open the barrier?

1026
01:40:32.895 --> 01:40:36.527
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1027
01:40:37.121 --> 01:40:41.503
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1028
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:55.269
Wakanda forever!

1029
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.378
Wakanda forever!

1030
01:41:07.789 --> 01:41:09.429
Now!

1031
01:41:39.022 --> 01:41:42.132
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.

1032
01:41:42.156 --> 01:41:44.748
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1033
01:41:51.016 --> 01:41:53.134
Allfathers, give me strength.

1034
01:41:53.158 --> 01:41:58.283
You understand, boy? You're about
to take the full force of a star.

1035
01:41:58.939 --> 01:42:00.939
It'll kill you.

1036
01:42:01.158 --> 01:42:03.665
And if I die?

1037
01:42:03.689 --> 01:42:08.728
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.

1038
01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:38.428
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1039
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:30.914
Thor? Say something, come on.

1040
01:43:31.173 --> 01:43:33.867
Thor, you okay?

1041
01:43:37.383 --> 01:43:41.718
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1042
01:43:42.452 --> 01:43:45.170
Where's the handle?

1043
01:43:46.772 --> 01:43:50.444
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1044
01:44:58.087 --> 01:45:00.071
There's too many of them!

1045
01:45:00.625 --> 01:45:04.336
You guys are so screwed now!

1046
01:45:06.931 --> 01:45:10.157
Bring me Thanos!

1047
01:45:41.634 --> 01:45:43.470
Oh, yeah.

1048
01:45:46.383 --> 01:45:49.696
You're much more of a Thanos.

1049
01:45:50.828 --> 01:45:53.836
I take it that Maw is dead?

1050
01:45:54.937 --> 01:45:58.311
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1051
01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:02.132
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1052
01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.023
You may regret that.
He brought you

1053
01:46:05.035 --> 01:46:07.929
face-to-face with a Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1054
01:46:10.452 --> 01:46:13.605
Where do you think
he brought you?

1055
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:17.839
Let me guess. Your home?

1056
01:46:21.114 --> 01:46:23.013
It was.

1057
01:46:25.013 --> 01:46:28.013
And it was beautiful.

1058
01:46:29.005 --> 01:46:34.513
Titan was like most planets. Too many
mouths, not enough to go around.

1059
01:46:34.536 --> 01:46:38.715
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1060
01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:40.904
Genocide?

1061
01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:45.248
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1062
01:46:45.904 --> 01:46:48.724
And they called me a madman.

1063
01:46:48.866 --> 01:46:53.068
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1064
01:46:54.054 --> 01:46:58.132
- Congratulations. You're a prophet.
- I'm a survivor.

1065
01:46:58.148 --> 01:47:00.632
Who wants to murder trillions.

1066
01:47:00.656 --> 01:47:04.702
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1067
01:47:04.726 --> 01:47:09.861
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1068
01:47:11.213 --> 01:47:14.002
And then what?

1069
01:47:14.291 --> 01:47:20.119
I finally rest. And watch the sun
rise on a grateful universe.

1070
01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:24.986
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1071
01:47:25.276 --> 01:47:31.135
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1072
01:47:31.455 --> 01:47:33.384
"Our"?

1073
01:47:38.327 --> 01:47:43.030
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1074
01:48:20.376 --> 01:48:22.305
Boom!

1075
01:48:22.774 --> 01:48:25.274
Don't let him close his fist.

1076
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.125
Magic! More magic!

1077
01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.484
Magic with a kick!

1078
01:48:34.594 --> 01:48:36.664
Magic with a...

1079
01:48:36.688 --> 01:48:38.469
Insect.

1080
01:49:14.691 --> 01:49:17.653
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1081
01:49:17.677 --> 01:49:20.825
Would have been a
waste of parts!

1082
01:49:24.756 --> 01:49:27.303
Where's Gamora?

1083
01:50:06.956 --> 01:50:08.417
Is he under? Don't let up.

1084
01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:11.253
Be quick. He is very strong.

1085
01:50:11.269 --> 01:50:16.159
Parker, help. Get over here. She can't
hold him much longer. Let's go.

1086
01:50:21.962 --> 01:50:23.447
I thought you'd be
harder to catch.

1087
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:26.189
For the record,
this was my plan.

1088
01:50:26.213 --> 01:50:27.994
Not so strong now, huh?

1089
01:50:28.432 --> 01:50:30.931
Where's Gamora?

1090
01:50:31.126 --> 01:50:34.657
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!

1091
01:50:34.681 --> 01:50:37.094
Where is she?

1092
01:50:37.118 --> 01:50:40.344
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1093
01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:42.251
He...

1094
01:50:42.275 --> 01:50:43.998
He mourns.

1095
01:50:44.022 --> 01:50:48.397
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1096
01:50:48.670 --> 01:50:50.631
Gamora...

1097
01:50:53.217 --> 01:50:54.685
What?

1098
01:50:54.709 --> 01:51:01.638
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1099
01:51:02.754 --> 01:51:06.761
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?

1100
01:51:07.230 --> 01:51:10.620
Don't. Don't engage. We
almost got this off!

1101
01:51:11.753 --> 01:51:15.034
Tell me she's lying.

1102
01:51:15.198 --> 01:51:18.628
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1103
01:51:19.682 --> 01:51:23.361
I had to...

1104
01:51:23.563 --> 01:51:26.564
No you didn't.

1105
01:51:29.517 --> 01:51:32.978
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1106
01:51:33.127 --> 01:51:38.205
- Just stop! Stop!
- It's coming, I got it, i got it!

1107
01:51:41.023 --> 01:51:43.101
Oh, God.

1108
01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:44.718
Come and get some, facedogs!

1109
01:52:46.812 --> 01:52:49.749
Come on! Get some, get some!

1110
01:52:51.999 --> 01:52:54.795
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1111
01:52:54.819 --> 01:52:57.522
Okay, how much for the arm?

1112
01:52:58.413 --> 01:53:00.975
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1113
01:53:09.286 --> 01:53:12.879
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1114
01:53:14.598 --> 01:53:17.044
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1115
01:53:17.068 --> 01:53:19.622
I am Groot!

1116
01:53:20.232 --> 01:53:22.622
I am Steve Rogers.

1117
01:53:41.806 --> 01:53:44.797
Fall back! Fall back now!

1118
01:53:53.162 --> 01:53:55.748
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1119
01:53:55.772 --> 01:53:57.888
I'm doing it.

1120
01:54:20.557 --> 01:54:22.853
Why was she up there
all this time?

1121
01:54:22.877 --> 01:54:26.338
She's on the field. Take it.

1122
01:54:57.145 --> 01:55:00.582
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1123
01:55:02.481 --> 01:55:05.599
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1124
01:55:05.623 --> 01:55:07.130
On my way.

1125
01:55:11.879 --> 01:55:14.816
He'll die alone. As will you.

1126
01:55:14.824 --> 01:55:16.785
She's not alone.

1127
01:55:42.176 --> 01:55:44.184
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1128
01:55:44.208 --> 01:55:46.403
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1129
01:55:46.415 --> 01:55:48.622
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1130
01:55:53.046 --> 01:55:56.374
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1131
01:55:57.584 --> 01:56:01.310
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.

1132
01:56:01.318 --> 01:56:05.349
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1133
01:56:08.505 --> 01:56:12.255
Hulk! Hulk! Shit, Hulk!

1134
01:56:12.849 --> 01:56:18.583
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!

1135
01:56:18.591 --> 01:56:22.153
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1136
01:56:34.828 --> 01:56:36.999
See ya!

1137
01:56:47.627 --> 01:56:50.525
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1138
01:57:01.215 --> 01:57:07.769
I thought you were a formidable machine.
But you're dying, like any man.

1139
01:57:15.327 --> 01:57:17.412
Get outta here!

1140
01:57:20.124 --> 01:57:22.053
Go!

1141
01:57:39.608 --> 01:57:41.787
That's really gross.

1142
01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:11.171
I thought I told you to go.

1143
01:58:11.195 --> 01:58:13.890
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1144
01:58:24.034 --> 01:58:26.744
I got you, I got you!

1145
01:58:26.768 --> 01:58:29.518
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.

1146
01:59:13.943 --> 01:59:16.794
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1147
01:59:17.287 --> 01:59:22.076
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1148
01:59:23.586 --> 01:59:25.781
A fake.

1149
01:59:32.735 --> 01:59:36.570
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1150
01:59:36.594 --> 01:59:39.016
- Stark.
- You know me?

1151
01:59:39.492 --> 01:59:44.320
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1152
01:59:45.070 --> 01:59:47.218
My only curse is you.

1153
02:00:17.674 --> 02:00:21.064
All that for a drop of blood.

1154
02:01:03.729 --> 02:01:06.298
You have my respect, Stark.

1155
02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:11.314
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1156
02:01:16.009 --> 02:01:19.157
I hope they remember you.

1157
02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:30.151
Stop.

1158
02:01:35.542 --> 02:01:40.502
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1159
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:45.616
No tricks.

1160
02:01:49.374 --> 02:01:51.436
Don't!

1161
02:02:41.897 --> 02:02:44.162
One to go.

1162
02:02:53.388 --> 02:02:55.817
Where is he?

1163
02:03:03.665 --> 02:03:06.766
Did we just lose?

1164
02:03:09.103 --> 02:03:12.211
Why would you do that?

1165
02:03:14.188 --> 02:03:17.586
We're in the endgame now.

1166
02:03:42.336 --> 02:03:44.656
Are you okay?

1167
02:03:45.578 --> 02:03:48.796
What? What is it?

1168
02:03:49.851 --> 02:03:52.281
He's here.

1169
02:04:01.876 --> 02:04:06.618
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1170
02:04:07.477 --> 02:04:10.508
What the hell?

1171
02:04:35.649 --> 02:04:38.938
Cap. That's him.

1172
02:04:40.437 --> 02:04:44.171
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1173
02:05:07.829 --> 02:05:10.922
Wanda. It's time.

1174
02:05:10.946 --> 02:05:14.375
- No.
- They can't stop him, Wanda. But we can.

1175
02:05:14.399 --> 02:05:17.635
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1176
02:05:17.659 --> 02:05:20.547
- Don't.
- You must. Please...

1177
02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:25.067
We are out of time.

1178
02:05:25.091 --> 02:05:29.700
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1179
02:05:46.167 --> 02:05:50.198
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1180
02:05:50.729 --> 02:05:56.385
It's not fair. It shouldn't
be you, but it is.

1181
02:05:57.112 --> 02:06:02.307
It's all right. You
could never hurt me.

1182
02:06:10.743 --> 02:06:14.094
I just feel you.

1183
02:07:51.809 --> 02:07:54.019
I love you.

1184
02:08:22.778 --> 02:08:25.574
I understand, my child.

1185
02:08:26.255 --> 02:08:29.224
Better than anyone.

1186
02:08:29.521 --> 02:08:31.880
You could never.

1187
02:08:36.307 --> 02:08:40.189
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1188
02:08:41.033 --> 02:08:44.618
But now is no time to mourn.

1189
02:08:45.885 --> 02:08:47.861
Now...

1190
02:08:47.885 --> 02:08:51.455
is no time at all.

1191
02:09:13.401 --> 02:09:16.166
No!

1192
02:10:12.261 --> 02:10:14.823
I told you...

1193
02:10:15.042 --> 02:10:18.768
You'd die for that.

1194
02:10:31.539 --> 02:10:33.930
You should have...

1195
02:10:35.593 --> 02:10:38.248
You...

1196
02:10:39.358 --> 02:10:43.459
You should have
gone for the head!

1197
02:10:44.844 --> 02:10:47.234
No!

1198
02:11:18.919 --> 02:11:21.356
Daughter?

1199
02:11:27.842 --> 02:11:30.084
Did you do it?

1200
02:11:31.176 --> 02:11:33.582
Yes.

1201
02:11:40.593 --> 02:11:43.491
What did it cost?

1202
02:11:45.685 --> 02:11:48.810
Everything.

1203
02:11:57.664 --> 02:11:59.632
What did you do?

1204
02:12:00.562 --> 02:12:03.186
What did you do?!

1205
02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:17.827
Where did he go?

1206
02:12:20.218 --> 02:12:22.265
Thor...

1207
02:12:24.328 --> 02:12:25.937
Where did he go?

1208
02:12:26.039 --> 02:12:28.296
Steve?

1209
02:13:02.005 --> 02:13:07.911
Up, General, up! This
is no place to die.

1210
02:13:21.446 --> 02:13:23.516
I am Groot...

1211
02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:24.797
No.

1212
02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:29.953
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1213
02:13:30.241 --> 02:13:32.209
No...

1214
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:47.415
Sam?

1215
02:13:49.947 --> 02:13:53.454
Sam, where you at?

1216
02:14:00.794 --> 02:14:04.309
Something's happenning...

1217
02:14:15.089 --> 02:14:17.573
Quill?

1218
02:14:23.678 --> 02:14:27.185
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...

1219
02:14:30.381 --> 02:14:32.076
Tony.

1220
02:14:34.858 --> 02:14:38.920
There was no other way.

1221
02:14:43.247 --> 02:14:45.356
Mr. Stark?

1222
02:14:48.505 --> 02:14:52.051
I don't feel so good...

1223
02:14:52.231 --> 02:14:56.153
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1224
02:14:57.371 --> 02:15:00.778
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...

1225
02:15:00.802 --> 02:15:03.535
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1226
02:15:07.603 --> 02:15:10.767
I'm sorry.

1227
02:15:23.921 --> 02:15:26.390
He did it.

1228
02:15:50.155 --> 02:15:54.046
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1229
02:16:10.314 --> 02:16:13.173
Oh, God.
