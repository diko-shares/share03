206
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.040
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

207
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.360
He wipes out
half the population.

208
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.240
He sent Loki.

209

the Power and Space Stones.

213

That already makes him

214
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.720
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

215
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.160
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.400
He could destroy life

217
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.520

If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

223
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.200
stick this one down

224
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400
No can do.

225
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.280
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

227

Point is, things change.

233
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.480
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

234
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.680
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

235
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880
Yeah, so conversely,

236
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.760
it may also be
his best chance against us.

we have this stone.

We know where it is.

244

248
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.120

off his transponder.

249

I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.760
So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.000
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

537
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.320
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.600
I feel your pain as well,
because...

540
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.960
I mean,
it's not a competition,

541
00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.160
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.000
-My father killed my mother.
-(SLURPING)

543
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.280
And then I had to kill
my father.

544
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.880
-That was hard.
-(SIGHS)

545
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.920
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

546
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.360
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

547
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.200
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.160
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

549
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.240
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

550
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.680
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Taking your pod.

551
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.080
(PETER CLEARS THROAT)

552
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.200
(IN DEEP VOICE)
No, you're not.

553
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.200
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

554
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.080
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

555
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.640
-No.
-You are.

556
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.480
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

557
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.840
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.040
-(GASPS) He just did it again!
-This is my voice.

559
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.600
-Are you mocking me?
-Stop it. You did it again.

561
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.080
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.160
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.960
-GAMORA: Enough!
-He's doing it first.

564
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.520
We need to stop Thanos.

565
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240
Which means
we need to find out

566
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320
where he's going next.

567
00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.720
Knowhere.

568
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.560
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.720
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, no. Knowhere?

570
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.560
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

571
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.160
-Excuse me, that's our food.
-Not anymore.

572
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.760
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

573
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.080
THOR: Because for years...

574
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.400
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

575
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.920
with a man
called the Collector.

576
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.680
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

577
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.560
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

578
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.080
-Or a genius.
-GAMORA: How do you know...

579
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.800
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

580
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.360
There are six stones
out there.

581
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.720
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

582
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.160
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

583
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.680
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

584
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.520
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

585
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.320
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

586
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400
They're with the Avengers.

587
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.000
-The Avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.

588
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.280
Like Kevin Bacon?

589
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.720
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

590
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.800
I haven't been there
in a while.

591
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.200
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

592
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.000
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.920
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.440
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

595
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.040
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

596
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.240
You're welcome.

597
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.640
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

598
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.480
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

599
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.760
-That's a made-up word.
-All words are made up.

600
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.000
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.800
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.400
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

603
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.520
(CHUCKLING)
to ever torment the universe.

604
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.720
I would very much like
to go there, please.

605
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.880
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.040
and clearly the smartest
among you.

607
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.160
Rabbit?

608
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.560
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

609
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.920
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

610
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.480
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.160
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

613
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.120
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

614
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.040
-Yeah. I'll go.
-Wonderful!

615
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.320
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

616
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400
THOR: Quiet.

617
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.080
-That's my backpack.
-ROCKET: Go sit down.

618

PETER: Look, this is my ship.

619
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.800
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.880
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

621
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.280
The Thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.640
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

623
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.840
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

624
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.080
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.360
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

626
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.440
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

627
00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.760
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.200
If we don't go to Knowhere

629
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.840
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

630
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.560
he'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.880
-He already is.
-I got it figured out.

632
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.760
We got two ships

633
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.240
and a large assortment
of morons.

634
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.640
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

635
00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.000
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

636
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.640
to try to stop Thanos.

637
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.760

I know that
you're going with him

640
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.440
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

641
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.120
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.320
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

to Glasgow...

What if this time
I didn't go back?

But you gave Stark your word.

664
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.480
I'd rather give it to you.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.600

expecting me too, you know.

900
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.200
Like to think of myself

901
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.760
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

902
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.960
-Let her go.
-Peter.

903

910
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600
Do it.

You know they're

924

you've chosen to

I paid for that.

Nat.

963
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.480
This is awkward.

964
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.520
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

965
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.840
And they can clearly find us.

966
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.240
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

-BANNER: Who's Scott?
-Ant-Man.

There's an Ant-Man

972
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.320
Okay, look.

973
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.240
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

974
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.800
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

975
00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.680
Vision's stone.

976
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.120
Then we have to protect it.

977
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.920
No, we have to destroy it.

978
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.360
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

979
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.440
to this entity in my head.

980
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.120
About its nature.

981
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.840
But also its composition.

982
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
I think if it were exposed

983
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.920
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

984
00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.920
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

985
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.680
its molecular integrity
could fail.

986
00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.480
Yeah, and you with it.

987
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.400
We're not having
this conversation.

988
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.560
VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

989
00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.640
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

990
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.400
That's too high a price.

991
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.280
Only you have
the power to pay it.

992
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.600

half the universe.

993
00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.280
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

994
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.880
But it should.

995
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.760
We don't trade lives, Vision.

996
00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.880
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

997
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.840
to save how many
millions of people?

998
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.040
Tell me,
why is this any different?

999
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.520
BANNER: Because you might
have a choice.

1000
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.160

Tony, me, the stone.

1004

all of them
learning from one another.

1005
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.000
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

1006
00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.240
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

1007
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.840
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

1008
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.360
Perhaps the best parts.

1009
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.040
Can we do that?

1010
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.800
Not me, not here.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
What's your plan?

1067
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.160
-Go.
-Um...

1068
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.240
Okay, okay... Uh...

1069
01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.720
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

1070
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.840
(SCREAMING)

1071
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.520
EBONY MAW:
Painful, aren't they?

1072
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.280
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

1073
01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.040
-And any one of them...
-(THUD)

1074
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.320
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

1075
01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.560
IRON MAN:<i> I gotta tell you,</i>
<i>he's not really my friend.</i>

1076
01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.400
<i>Saving his life is more</i>
<i>of a professional courtesy.</i>

1077
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.920
You've saved nothing.

1078
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800
Your powers
are inconsequential

1079
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.120
compared to mine.

1080
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.160
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

1081
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720

1082
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.960

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.440
(GRUNTS)

1084
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.480
SPIDER-MAN: Yes! Wait.
What are those?

1085
01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.880
(YELLING)

1086
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.720
(GRUNTS)

1087
01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.840
SPIDER-MAN: Hey,
we haven't officially met.

1088
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.240
Cool.

1089
01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.680
We gotta turn
this ship around.

1090
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.840
STARK: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

1091
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.400
No, I want to protect
the stone.

1092
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.760
STARK: And I want you
to thank me.

1093
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.360
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

1094
01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.240
DR. STRANGE: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

1095
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.640
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

1096
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840
I seriously don't know

1097
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.080
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1098
01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.480
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1099
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.160
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1100
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.240
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

1101
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.000
And due to that fact,

1102
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.400
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1103
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.240
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

1104
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.320
-I'm backup.
-No, you're a stowaway.

1105
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520
The adults are talking.

1106
01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.240
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1107
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.040
What is he, your ward?

1108
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.200
No.

1109
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.600
-I'm Peter, by the way.
-Doctor Strange.

1110
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.480
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1111
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.680
I'm Spider-Man, then.

1112
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.120
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1113
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200
Thing's on autopilot.

1114
01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.080
DR. STRANGE:
Can we control it?

1115
01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.160
Fly us home?

1116
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160
-Stark?
-Yeah.

1117
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.560
Can you get us home?

1118
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.000
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.760
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1120
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.920
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.560
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1122
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.880
I don't think
you quite understand

1123
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.960
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.480
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1125
01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.400
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.120
Since he sent an army
to New York

1127
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.760
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.840
And I don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.200
So I'm not so sure

1130
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.040
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.840
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1132
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.240
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.160
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1134
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320
Doctor.

1135
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.680
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.760
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1137
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.880
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.720
if it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.240
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1140
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.240
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.760
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1142
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.240
Nice. Good, moral compass.
(PATS ARM)

1143
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.000
We're straight.

1144
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.640
(SIGHS) All right, kid.

1145
01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.960
You're an Avenger now.

1146
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.840
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1147
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.560
I always hated that chair.

1148
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.800
THANOS: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.360
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.680
I hated this room.

1151
01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.840
This ship.

1152
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.800
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.480
THANOS: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.000
Every day.

1155
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.760
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.720
I was a child
when you took me.

1157
01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.960
I saved you.

1158
01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.440
No.

1159
01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.480
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1160
01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.840
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.040
scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.080
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1163
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.240
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.560
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1165
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.360
The children born...

1166
01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.360
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1167
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.760
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.320
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1169
01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.360
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1170
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520
You're insane.

1171
01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.640
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1172
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.600
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1173
01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.160
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1174
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.640
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.200
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.800
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1177
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.800
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1178
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.360
For a time...

1179
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.200
you had that same will...

1180
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.240
as you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.160
Daughter.

1182
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.720
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.880
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1184
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.120
And, in doing so,

1185
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.440
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1186
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.200
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1187
01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.040
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1188
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.520
(THANOS SIGHS)

1189
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.360
I am disappointed.

1190
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.640
But not because
you didn't find it.

1191
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.960
But because you did.

1192
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.200
And you lied.

1193
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.400
GAMORA: Nebula.

1194
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.000
Don't do this.

1195
01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.360
THANOS: Some time ago,

1196
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.160
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1197
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320
Please don't do this.

1198
01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.720
THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

1199
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.840
So I brought her here.

1200
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.640
To talk.

1201
01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.280
(SCREAMING)

1202
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.680
Stop. Stop it.

1203
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.920
I swear to you on my life.

1204
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.680
I never found the Soul Stone.

1205
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.400
NEBULA:
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1206
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.920
<i>You know</i>
<i>what he's about to do.</i>

1207
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.680
<i>He's finally ready,</i>
<i>and he's going for the stones.</i>

1208
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.960
<i>-All of them.</i>
<i>-He can never get them all.</i>

1209
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080
NEBULA: <i>He will!</i>

1210
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.120
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1211
01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.640
<i>Because I found the map</i>
<i>to the Soul Stone...</i>

1212
01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.600
<i>and I burned it to ash.</i>
<i>I burned it.</i>

1213
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.440
You're strong.

1214
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480
Me.

1215
01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.640
You're generous.

1216
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Me.

1217
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.400
But I never taught you to lie.

1218
01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.200
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1219
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.960
Where is the Soul Stone?

1220
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.600

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.080
The stone is on Vormir.

1225
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.840
Show me.

1226
01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.000
GROOT: I am Groot.

1227
01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.280
ROCKET: Tinkle in the cup.

1228
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.720
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1229
01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.040
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1230
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.280
I am Groot.

1231
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.520
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1232
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.080
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1233
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.600
You speak Groot?

1234
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.560
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1235
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.760
I am Groot.

1236
01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.920
You'll know when we're close.

1237
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.680
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1238

Okay, time to be the captain.

1242
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.000
So, dead brother, huh?

1243
01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.520
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1244
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.880
Well, he's been dead before.

1245
01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.880
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1246

And you said
your sister and your dad?

1247
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.160
Both dead.

1248

But still got a mom, though?

1249

You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1253
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.080
Absolutely.

1254

Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1259
01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.960
he's the toughest there is.

1260
01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.160
-Well, he's never fought me.
-Yeah, he has.

1261

He's never fought me twice.

1262
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.280
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1263

I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1267
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.040
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1268

but none succeeded.

1269
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.720
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1270
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.680
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1271
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.720
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1272

He gave you his eye?

1287
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.800
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1288
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.920
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1412
01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.600
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1413
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.960
It's a mold.

1414
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.720
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.000
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1416
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.520
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1417
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.120
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.560
Stormbreaker.

1419
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.160
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.280
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.320
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1422
01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.480
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1423
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.760
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1424
01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.360
PETER: The hell happened
to this planet?

1425
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.320
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1426
01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.640
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1427
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.760
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1428
01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.360
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1429
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.760
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1430
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.280
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1431
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.560
pin him down,
get what we need.

1432
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.400
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1433
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.520
We just want the gauntlet.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.480
-Are you yawning?
-(YAWNING)

1435
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.720
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1436
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.840
Did you hear what I said?

1437
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.960
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1438
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.200
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1439
01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.200
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1440
01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.880
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1441
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.600
Kick names, take ass.

1442
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.040

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.080
All right, just get over here,
please.

1445
01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.400
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1446
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.760
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1447
01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.760
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

1448
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.560
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1449
01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.000
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1450
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.360
We don't know what it means.

1451
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.360
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1452
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.000
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1453
01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.080
and that way
it might be really good.

1454
01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.200
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1455
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.480
-STARK: What dance-off?
-(STAMMERS) It's nothing.

1456
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.680
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1457
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.240
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1458
01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.280
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1459
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.560
SPIDER-MAN: It never was.

1460
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.800
STARK: Don't encourage this,
all right?

1461
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.160
-Okay.
-We're getting no help

1462
01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.840
-from Flash Gordon here.
-Flash Gordon?

1463
01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.040
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1464
01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.120
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1465
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.840
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1466
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040
that's 100% you.

1467
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.480
STARK: Your math
is blowing my mind.

1468

MANTIS: Excuse me.

1469
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.280
But does your friend
often do that?

1470
01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.960

-DR. STRANGE: Hi.
-Hey, what was that?

1475
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.360
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1476
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.800
To see all
the possible outcomes

1477
01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.720
of the coming conflict.

1478
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.800
How many did you see?

1479
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.200
14,000,605.

1480
01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.280
How many did we win?

1481
01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.200
One.

1482
01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.120
THANOS: The stone
had better be up there.

1483
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.040
For your sister's sake.

1484
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.680
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1485
01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.040
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1486
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.360
THANOS: You know us?

1487
01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.080
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1488
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.240
Where is the Soul Stone?

1489
01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.640
You should know...

1490
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.400
it extracts a terrible price.

1491
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.320
I am prepared.

1492
01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.200
We all think that at first.

1493
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.040
We are all wrong.

1494
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.000
THANOS: How is it you know
this place so well?

1495
01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:59.480
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1496
01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.640
I even held one in my hand.

1497
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.880
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1498
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.080
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1499
01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.720
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1500
01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.800
As does what you fear.

1501
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.000
What's this?

1502
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.080
RED SKULL: The price.

1503
01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.880
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1504
01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.960
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1505
01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.160
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1506
01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.880
RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1507
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.600
understands its power...

1508
01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.280
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1509
01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.000
Of what?

1510
01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.400
In order to take the stone,

1511
01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.880
you must lose
that which you love.

1512
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.120
A soul...

1513
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.000
for a soul.

1516

a moment...

1517
01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.840
when you got
what you deserved.

1518
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.320
And I was always
so disappointed.

1519
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.400
But now...

1520
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.440
You kill and torture...

1521
01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.400
and you call it mercy.

1522
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.560
The universe has judged you.

1523
01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.600
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1524
01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.640
You failed.

1525
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.920
And do you wanna know why?

1526
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.720
Because you love nothing.

1527
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.040
No one.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.840
