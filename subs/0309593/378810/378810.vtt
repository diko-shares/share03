HOST:
Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary...

2
00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.027
...since Volee Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed...

3
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.739
...shortly after takeoff from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.699
Itâ€™s a disaster that's affected many.

5
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.410
None more so than
Mount Abraham High School...

6
00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:34.702
...which lost 40 students
and four faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.711
But it was the events after the crash...

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.295
...that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:44.087
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed...

10
00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:48.929
...died soon thereafter in a series
of mysterious and bizarre accidents.

11
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.844
Now, to some,
these deaths are just tragic coincidences...

12
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.016
...but to others, they're an indication that
there are more sinister events taking place.

13
00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:59.150
That's the contention of
uh, tonight's guest.

14
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.108
-Thank you for joining us this evening.
GUEST: Thank you for having me.

15
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.070
Ahem. And I appreciate you using
the word "sinister. "

16
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.825
Most people say "supernatural. "

17
00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.158
They think I'm talking about ghosts
and witches and stuff like that.

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.119
HOST: Well, here's your chance
to set the record straight, so ....

19
00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.910
GUEST:
Great. Okay, well...

20
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.500
...I believe that there 's a sort of force...

21
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:25.966
...uh, an unseen malevolent presence
that's all around us every day.

22
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.553
And it determines when we live and die.

23
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:33.811
And some people call this force the devil.

24
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.722
You know, but I think
that whole religious thing is ....

25
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.983
So I prefer to call it death itself

26
00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:42.440
HOST:
So I'm surrounded by death?

27
00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.571
G U EST:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

28
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.451
Every day, everywhere, all the time.

29
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.737
And that's what I want people
to understand...

30
00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:55.078
...that death has this grand design
that we all Ht into.

31
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.121
So when Alex Browning got off that plane
and took the other survivors with him...

32
00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.756
...he basically screwed up death 's plan.

33
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.542
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

34
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.182
HOST: And the fact that all of the survivors
have died is your evidence of this?

35
00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:15.474
GUEST: Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died...

36
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.185
...but it's the way that they died.

37
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:23.903
I mean, there were so many weird, seemingly
random things about the way they died.

38
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.280
Lt just didn't make sense.

39
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.658
You know, that's the proof
that there's something out there--

40
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.162
HOST: Wait, that's not proof l mean,
that is your interpretation of events...

41
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.871
...that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

43
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.086
GUEST: Yeah, but you should be
more open-minded--

44
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.373
HOST: What happened after
that was just coincidence.

45

GUEST:
May I finish ?

46
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.132
A mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

47
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.343
But not all of them
including their teachers.

48
00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:56.852
HOST: Yes, but people die all the time,
so why should this be any different?

49
00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:02.855
Lt forced people to question
these so-called everyday coincidences.

50
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.689
What if they were something more?

51
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.024
-What if you could do something about it?
HOST: Ha, ha.

52
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.315
Please, are you listening to yourself?
This is crazy.

53
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:13.031
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

54

That's exactly what I'm saying.

55
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.747
Exactly it.

56
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.033
And in order to survive...

57
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.831
...the only way to survive
is to look beneath the visible world.

58
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.921
Because in the end,
no one can escape death.

59
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.304

You said that someone else
died last night.

it'll come back for you.
