Where's my phone?

7
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.898
Where the fuck am I?

8
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.401
Hey.

9
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.529
Hello!

10
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:54.740
Hello!

11
00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.913
What the fuck?

12
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.414
What the fuck?

13
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.540
Fuck!

14
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.505
What the fuck?

15
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.260
I don't know where I'm at, man.
Where am I?

16
00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.221
Anybody?

17
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.139
Would you shut the fuck up?

18
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.934
It's loud enough in here
without you yelling in my ear.

19
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.063
Hello! You can hear me?

20
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.856
Huh?

21
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.150
Chill, man, yes,
I-I can hear you.

22
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.070
Oh, shit.

23
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.031
Hey, man. Who-who are you?
What's... What's going on, huh?

24
00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.301
Oh, fuck, you're still
coming outta the hole, aren't you?

25
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.494
I gotta admit, I'm-I'm kinda jealous.

26
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.913
What the fuck are you talking about?

27
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.624
What hole? I don't...
I'm not supposed to be here.

28
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.349
It's the... the propofol hole.

29
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.710
They dosed you.

30
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.796
Oh, fuck, you are gonna feel depressed

31
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.006
as a motherfucker for the next few days.

32
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.341
It's gonna suck.

33
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.135
And tomorrow's gonna be rough
for a few reasons.

34
00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.404
What the fuck are you talking about?

35
00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.697
Fuck, I gotta
get back to work, man.

36
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.074
Listen, I'm gonna holler at you later.

37
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.534
- I gotta go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:04.184
Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey.

What is this?

43
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.279
Fuck this shit.

No, I'm not supposed to be here.

46

Wait, wait. Hold on.

And she-she's pregnant.

55
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.890

59
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.022
I-I don't work here at all, okay?

60
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.315
Work... I work at Mallard.

61
00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.858
I'm-I'm a manager at Mallard.

62

That-that-that's right.
I'm... work on the fifth floor.

63
00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.505

64
00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.756
<i>How does it feel?!</i>

65
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:42.908
Fuck!

66
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:48.830
Shit!

67
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.832
Where the fuck am I?

68
00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:02.886
I don't deserve this.
I'm not supposed to be here.

69
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.931
I'm not supposed to be here.

70

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

71
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:55.475
Shit.

72

Come on, come on, Mallard,
information please!

84
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:23.318
It's broken or something.

85
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.988
It's not broken.

86
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.575
It's working. Just not for us.

87
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:32.995
Hey, hey, hey, friend, what's up, man?

88
00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:35.348
What, what,
what, what's going on?

89
00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.083
Uh, it's a countdown
to midnight.

90
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:41.795
What-what happens at midnight?

91
00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:45.132
You'll see.

92
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.652
What do you mean I'll see?
What-what are you saying, huh?

93
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.778
Hey, I don't wanna ruin

Come on, come on, just-just let me know
a little more.

98
00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.479
Matter of fact, what, what, what,
what's your name?

99
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.483
Hey, everybody,
do we do names around here?

100
00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.211
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!

101
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:10.259
Welcome to the neighborhood.

102
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.825

Hello?

104
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.622
Who else is fuckin' here?

105
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:19.142
- Kiss my ass!
- Shut the fuck up!

106
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.286
I'm trying to fucking sleep!

107
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:25.172
This is so... Is this fucking real, man?

108
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.798
Who are all these people?

109
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:28.842
They're your people.

110
00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:31.428
What people? What the fuck are you sayin'?

111
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.723
This is the paperclip factory,
my friend,

112
00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:38.227
solving supply and demand problems
by eliminating

113
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:41.355
all of the people
who actually supply and demand.

114
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.067
It's where you're sent
when you piss off the duck.

115
00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:54.159
Piss off the duck.

116
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.428
Piss off the duck. Piss off...

117
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.496
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

118
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.664
That's not Mallard.

119
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.375
Yeah.

120
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.210
You haven't figured it out?

121
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.463
This place is Mallard.

122
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.342
Wait, wait.

123
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:18.851
This place is Mallard?

124
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

125
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:26.918
- It can't be.
- Yeah,

126
00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:28.777
it's not gonna make any sense right now.

127
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:30.445
Forget it, but it will.

128
00:09:31.697 --> 00:09:33.699
Just try to get some sleep tonight, man.

00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:41.071
Did-did-did some... Did somebody die?

182
00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:43.323
Somebody died.
I saw just... just saw some hair

183
00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:46.618
and-and some bones, a fuckin' skull.

184
00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:49.329
Yeah, uh,
quite a few people did.

185
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.124
And odds are they're
not gonna be the last.

186
00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.625
No, no, no, no, no, no.

187
00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:55.669
This... This-this is a legit

188
00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:58.380
worldwide trillion-dollar fucking company.

189
00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.215
They wouldn't do no sick like that, right?

190
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.259
They would do it
if you said they could.

191
00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.428
Look all of that on boarding paperwork

192
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.846
they had you sign, right?

193
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.264
Those non-disclosures,

194
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.057
the fine print, the shit like that.

195
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.800
Hey, did you read any of that?

196
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:14.563
Yeah, of course you didn't. Nobody does.

197
00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:17.941
Everybody gets so excited being welcomed
by the great Mallard,

198
00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.943
but it gives them permission to do

199
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:22.196
just about anything they fucking want.

200
00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:24.323
And everything has a cost.

201
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.033
Don't forget what they said.

202
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.368
You get out of it what you put into it.

203
00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.787
So the sooner you settle into a rhythm,

204
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.789
the easier these days are gonna get.

205
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.001
Days.

206
00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:38.128
Days, days, days, days.

207
00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.213
What-what...?

208
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.965
How long do they plan on keeping us here?

209
00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:45.219
As long as it fucking takes.

210
00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:48.222
Just do your job.

211
00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:52.893
What job?

212
00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.482
Now you wanna fuckin' work, huh?

213
00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:01.693
<i>Good morning, Joe,
I trust you slept well.</i>

214
00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.570
You know somethin'?

215
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.113
Where the fuck am I, huh?

216
00:15:05.197 --> 00:15:06.323
What the fuck is this?

217
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.242
<i>Joe, I need you to listen.</i>

218
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.744
I don't wanna fuckin' listen!
You know somethin'?

219
00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.162
<i>- Joe...</i>
- No, shut up!

220
00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.456
Hey, fuck that! You listen!

221
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.917
I'm not supposed to be
in this motherfucker!

222
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.377
I didn't do anything!

223
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.671
Only thing I ever done
was go to fucking work

224
00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.464
for 10 years straight.

225
00:15:22.548 --> 00:15:24.192
Now, look at me!

226
00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.528
I'm trapped in this shit!

227
00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:28.345
Get me the fuck outta here!

228
00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:31.807
Whoever's in charge, whoever got their
hand in your ass,

229
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.018
tell them to let me the fuck out now!

230
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:37.354
Fuck!

231
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.566
<i>I believe you're ready to listen.</i>

232
00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.319
<i>Today begins your advanced career
training seminar.</i>

233
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.113
<i>Your opportunity.</i>

234
00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.115
<i>Your last quarter's productivity</i>

235
00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:50.367
<i>dropped while your
use of personal time tripled.</i>

236
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:54.496
<i>Unlimited personal time is one
of our many generous employment perks.</i>

237
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.748
<i>Unfortunately, during this period,</i>

238
00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:59.167
<i>your department's
overall performance declined.</i>

239
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.838
<i>When your performance drops,
your department number lowers.</i>

240
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.923
<i>When your department numbers lower,</i>

241
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:06.758
<i>your division output drops.</i>

242
00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:08.510
<i>When your division output drops,</i>

243
00:16:08.594 --> 00:16:10.345
<i>the company performance declines,</i>

244
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.139
<i>as does the stock.</i>

245
00:16:12.598 --> 00:16:14.349
<i>Don't undervalue yourself.</i>

246
00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:16.143
<i>You're a crucial part of our team.</i>

247
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.146
<i>Joe, you were once the model employee,</i>

248
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.356
<i>but you've lost your appreciation
for this company</i>

249
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.691
<i>and all it has given you.</i>

250
00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:24.526
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

251
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.528
<i>Let's discuss your new job.</i>

252
00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:29.865
<i>The workday begins at 6:00 a.m. and ends
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

253
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:32.534
<i>The hours between are your own to do
with as you like.</i>

254
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.745
<i>You work consists of pushing the mill.</i>

255
00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.207
<i>Employees earn a single point
for each full revolution.</i>

256
00:16:38.624 --> 00:16:41.335
<i>Every day you are required
to meet your specified goal,</i>

257
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.212
<i>your daily quota.</i>

258
00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:45.797
<i>Failure to meet your daily quota</i>

259
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:47.299
<i>will result in a punishment.</i>

260
00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.593
<i>Your daily quota is 50.</i>

261
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:52.721
<i>Your quota is your minimum target.</i>

262
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.432
<i>But at Mallard,
good enough isn't good enough.</i>

263
00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.268
<i>Regardless of the quota,
at the end of each day,</i>

264
00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:01.021
<i>the employee with the fewest points
will be terminated.</i>

265
00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.065
<i>We understand.</i>

266
00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:04.858
<i>We are not just a company.</i>

267
00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:06.276
<i>We're a family.</i>

268
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.112
<i>We want you to keep your job, your salary,</i>

269
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:13.075
<i>your corporate housing,
your company car, your life.</i>

270
00:17:13.492 --> 00:17:15.327
<i>You're a crucial part of our mission.</i>

271
00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:18.372
<i>That's why we've brought you here
to help you grow.</i>

272
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.626
<i>We look forward to continuing
our working relationship at Mallard,</i>

273
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:25.045
<i>your company for life.</i>

274
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:27.214
<i>Have a great day.</i>

275
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:30.259
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

276
00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:33.303
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

277
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.931
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm s... I'm so sorry.

278
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.492
I didn't, I didn't mean to yell at first.

279
00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:40.143
I... I gotta, I gotta get back home
to my wife.

280
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.104
Please, please let me go back, please.

281
00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.273
Please, I can't be here. I can't be here.

282
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.316
I can't be. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

283
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.710
- We gotta get outta here.
- Stop.

284
00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.170
Dude, help me get the fuck outta here.

285
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.463
- Dude, stop!
- I need to get back to my wife.

286
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:51.840
The duck
doesn't fucking care, okay?

287
00:17:51.864 --> 00:17:53.784
It doesn't care if you've
got a family back home.

288
00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:55.075
We've all got families.

289
00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.285
You are here now.

290
00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.704
This is your fucking world. That is it.

291
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.497
And there is no getting out of it,

292
00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:02.207
not until they say you're ready.

293
00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:06.169
So for now, man,
you just simply need to survive.

294
00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:09.131
And the only way to do that is to work.

295
00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.733
Do you... Do you hear what I'm saying?

296
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.759
You wanna live,
you wanna see whoever the fuck

297
00:18:12.843 --> 00:18:15.137
you've got there
on the other side ever again,

298
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.472
then just do the work.

299
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:19.099
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

300
00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.508
It's pushing that thing, right?

301
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:23.705
I have to push that thing, right?

302
00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:24.938
Yeah, man, just push

303
00:18:25.022 --> 00:18:26.273
the fuckin' thing.

304
00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:30.152
Shit.

305
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.029

306
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.202

308
00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:43.332
<i>One second.</i>

309
00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:29.002
Come on, come on, come on,

<i>Discover tranquility
in the midst of turmoil</i>

356
00:22:55.417 --> 00:22:56.877
<i>with Mallard Meditation.</i>

357
00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:24.738
Oh, here we go.

358
00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:33.093
Hey, you still there, neighbor?

359
00:23:33.914 --> 00:23:34.998
Unfortunately.

360
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:39.378
So, how many did you get?

361
00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:42.965
A hundred.

362
00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:44.341
Wow.

363
00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:45.926
A hundred?

364
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.012
Is that a "wow, good" or "wow, bad"?

365
00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:50.671
Okay, let's just say

366
00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:53.517
somebody else
must've had a really bad day.

367
00:23:54.643 --> 00:23:56.687
You know what I don't understand is,

368
00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:00.148
so you don't make your quota,
you get punished, right?

369
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:03.402
But if you do make your quota,
you become last,

370
00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:04.987
then you get killed.

371
00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:08.532
So what's the point of the quota, huh?

372
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:11.869
Good enough
isn't fucking good enough.

373
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:13.912
That's the Mallard way.

374
00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:16.540
But I doubled my quota...

375
00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:18.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, no. God.

376
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:19.835
What, what, what?

377
00:24:20.502 --> 00:24:22.421
You do not go telling people

378
00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:24.590
your quota, genius, okay?

379
00:24:24.673 --> 00:24:28.385
'Cause as long as I do
more than you, my ass is safe.

380
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:30.971
You and I, we might be neighbors,

381
00:24:31.054 --> 00:24:33.015
but we are not friends.

382
00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:36.185
You get it? We are competition,
and don't forget that.

383
00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:41.190
First of all, I want you
to hear me and hear me well.

384
00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:42.649
I'm not dumb.

385
00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:44.651
Right, sure you're not.

386
00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:47.237
No, I got 50,000 in student debt
that says I'm not.

387
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:49.364
Ooh, college man.

388
00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:50.616
You don't even know, man.

389
00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:53.076
I-I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

390
00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:56.330
I worked my ass off
to get to where I'm at, okay?

391
00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:57.915
Mm-hmm.

392
00:24:58.123 --> 00:25:00.209
All the way to the top of Mallard, huh?

393
00:25:01.376 --> 00:25:04.046
They fed me the same bullshit
when I started.

394
00:25:04.379 --> 00:25:06.757
They shoved it down my fucking throat

395
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.051
with a big, fat signing bonus.

396
00:25:09.134 --> 00:25:12.179
And that was more money
than I'd ever seen at the time.

397
00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:14.139
And look at us now.

398
00:25:14.223 --> 00:25:15.349
We made it.

399
00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:17.142
Cheers.

400
00:25:17.226 --> 00:25:18.936
This shit is fucked up, man.

401
00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:23.524
How the fuck did I
get caught up in this bullshit?

402
00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:27.876
I'm supposed to be at home with my wife.

403
00:25:30.489 --> 00:25:32.199
You know, she's pregnant, you know?

404
00:25:33.992 --> 00:25:35.452
With our first child.

405
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.288
We've been trying for a while, too,

406
00:25:38.372 --> 00:25:41.500
and finally, finally, it's happening.

407
00:25:44.336 --> 00:25:46.046
And I'm stuck in this crazy shit.

408
00:25:49.383 --> 00:25:50.509
Boy or girl?

409
00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:55.514
It's a boy.

410
00:25:58.308 --> 00:25:59.393
Joe Junior.

411
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.314
We gon' call him JJ.

412
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.651
So, you're Joe?

413
00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:10.863
Yeah.

414
00:26:11.488 --> 00:26:12.781
Well, Joe,

415
00:26:12.865 --> 00:26:14.741
I'm gonna give you some real advice.

416
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.327
If you ever expect
to meet your little boy,

417
00:26:17.411 --> 00:26:19.496
you just gotta do this shit right.

418
00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:22.958
The guy who was in that cell before you,

419
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:24.626
he thought he was doing enough,

420
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.712
and he was really smug about it, too.

421
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:28.922
And then the day before yesterday,

422
00:26:29.006 --> 00:26:30.966
enough wasn't enough.

423
00:26:31.466 --> 00:26:34.303
And now you're there and he's gone.

424
00:26:36.346 --> 00:26:37.826
Okay, and? Look, I'll just go harder.

425
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.725
Yeah, but no,
if you go too hard,

426
00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:42.477
they're gonna expect that all the time.

427
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:44.438
That's the whole game.

428
00:26:58.285 --> 00:26:59.661
Have fun.

429
00:27:18.388 --> 00:27:19.890
So?

430
00:27:19.973 --> 00:27:21.308
I mean, what do you think?

431
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:26.563
Um, I mean, it's... big.

432
00:27:27.856 --> 00:27:28.857
Hmm.

433
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:33.153
Do we really want all this?

434
00:27:33.237 --> 00:27:34.877
Babe, Babe, Babe, look, hear me out.

435
00:27:36.156 --> 00:27:37.574
I'm doing this for us.

436
00:27:38.283 --> 00:27:39.284
Hmm.

437
00:27:39.368 --> 00:27:40.888
This is everything we worked for.

438
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:48.877
You're lucky you cute
when you're being convincing.

439
00:27:50.963 --> 00:27:53.507
Well, we are at Mallard Crossing.

440
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.385
Ooh, ooh.

441
00:27:58.053 --> 00:27:59.054
Wow.

442
00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:03.058
Oh, tomorrow's the 12-week check-in.

443
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:04.643
You took the time off, right?

444
00:28:07.229 --> 00:28:08.355
Yeah.

445
00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:12.025
Joe, what?

446
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:14.486
We gotta prioritize, babe.

447
00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:18.031
This isn't gonna get any easier.

448
00:28:20.242 --> 00:28:22.119
- Oh.
- Everything okay?

449
00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:23.370
Something's wrong.

450
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:36.049
<i>The time is now 10 o'clock.</i>

451
00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:38.177
<i>Your work is complete for the day.</i>

452
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.845
<i>Thank you for your continued commitment</i>

453
00:28:39.928 --> 00:28:41.638
<i>to self-improvement, Joe.</i>

454
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:51.023
<i>Employee.</i>

455
00:28:51.607 --> 00:28:52.608
Yeah?

456
00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:54.860
<i>Evening, employee.</i>

457
00:28:56.278 --> 00:28:57.863
<i>Go ahead and approach the door.</i>

458
00:28:57.946 --> 00:28:59.323
Approach the door?

459
00:29:00.574 --> 00:29:02.451
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

460
00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:06.038
Um, hey, I-I-I-I made 1-150 today.

461
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:07.921
- I-I tripled my quota.
<i>- Good for you.</i>

462
00:29:07.956 --> 00:29:09.791
<i>Approach the goddamn door.</i>

463
00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:12.044
Please, please, please, please. Uh...

464
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:16.065
I thought I, I thought
I did everything right.

465
00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:17.409
<i>Approach the fucking door!</i>

466
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.056
<i>Now, stop.</i>

467
00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:29.311
<i>Remove your clothes.</i>

468
00:29:32.064 --> 00:29:34.399
<i>Take off your clothes.</i>

469
00:29:36.109 --> 00:29:38.695
Wh-why... Why you want me to do that?

470
00:29:39.488 --> 00:29:41.031
<i>Because I said so.</i>

471
00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.304
Seriously, why-why-why you
need me to take off my...

472
00:29:46.328 --> 00:29:48.014
<i>Come on, take 'em off.</i>

473
00:29:48.038 --> 00:29:49.081
Okay, okay, okay.

474
00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:51.667
Take 'em off.

475
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:52.793
Take 'em off.

476
00:30:03.762 --> 00:30:06.098
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.</i>

477
00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:08.517
<i>Everything.</i>

478
00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:23.991
<i>Now, walk through the door.</i>

479
00:30:43.302 --> 00:30:44.511
<i>Step forward.</i>

480
00:32:05.008 --> 00:32:06.343
Hey!

481
00:32:06.426 --> 00:32:07.427
Whoa!

482
00:32:10.848 --> 00:32:12.683
It's a scorcher today, man.

483
00:32:13.851 --> 00:32:15.435
It's way hotter than last week.

484
00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:20.357
Why are we doing this?

485
00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:22.401
To not die?

486
00:32:25.112 --> 00:32:26.196
No shit.

487
00:32:26.905 --> 00:32:27.966
That's not what I'm talking about.

488
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.324
Like, what is this? What...

489
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.203
What's this fucking mill, huh?

490
00:32:34.788 --> 00:32:36.081
It's nothing.

491
00:32:38.208 --> 00:32:39.751
What do you mean it's nothing?

492
00:32:40.002 --> 00:32:41.712
We're not grinding wheat

493
00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:43.547
or making electricity,

494
00:32:44.131 --> 00:32:46.175
or creating anything of value,

495
00:32:46.717 --> 00:32:48.760
tangible or perceived.

496
00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:52.890
This has no purpose.

497
00:32:53.724 --> 00:32:55.225
This is nothing.

498
00:32:56.935 --> 00:32:57.936
Nothing?

499
00:33:00.898 --> 00:33:02.149
So what's the point?

500
00:33:06.153 --> 00:33:07.196
Exactly.

501
00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:27.799
Fuck!

502
00:33:28.884 --> 00:33:30.093
It's too damn hot, man.

503
00:33:30.177 --> 00:33:32.137
I need... I need some more water.

504
00:33:32.888 --> 00:33:34.640
Mallard, I need, I need some water.

505
00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:37.267
Guard?

506
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.061
Guard, water!

507
00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:40.371
Do you think that sick fuck

508
00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:41.813
is gonna fix you a cocktail?

509
00:33:41.897 --> 00:33:43.732
- Come on.
- Shut the fuck up.

510
00:33:43.815 --> 00:33:46.109
Hey, please, I need something to drink.

511
00:33:46.527 --> 00:33:47.611
I need some water.

512
00:33:47.694 --> 00:33:48.796
I get it, I get it, I get it.

513
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.489
I-I got... I have a solution, okay?

514
00:33:50.906 --> 00:33:52.241
There's a pillar over there

515
00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.743
that Mallard can't see behind.
Do you see it?

516
00:34:02.626 --> 00:34:03.710
Yeah, I see it.

517
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:06.964
Okay, so,
hide some bottles back there.

518
00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:10.884
Fill 'em with your piss,
and then you have to drink it.

519
00:34:14.972 --> 00:34:16.890
You want me to drink

520
00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:19.268
my piss?

521
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:20.978
Fuck, no, not straight.

522
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:24.147
You gotta filter it through the insoles
of your shoes.

523
00:34:26.984 --> 00:34:28.819
Are you fuckin' crazy?

524
00:34:29.194 --> 00:34:34.366
I'm not pouring piss
in my fucking Jordans.

525
00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:38.996
Oh, Jesus.

526
00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:40.998
Joe, Mallard is perfect.

527
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:42.249
It knows how much water

528
00:34:42.332 --> 00:34:45.043
you need to survive, man, to the ounce.

529
00:34:45.127 --> 00:34:48.964
She is gonna give you
just enough to keep you alive.

530
00:34:50.215 --> 00:34:53.802
This place, it has a way of showing you
what you're capable of.

531
00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:58.140
That's what Mallard wants,
to know how far you can go

532
00:34:58.223 --> 00:34:59.558
before you break.

533
00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:03.061
Is that what Mallard wants?

534
00:35:05.981 --> 00:35:07.441
That's what Mallard gon' get.

535
00:35:22.623 --> 00:35:24.291
How do they, um,

536
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:27.628
how do they expect us to pay
all these medical bills?

537
00:35:28.253 --> 00:35:30.005
Hey, hey, don't worry about it.

538
00:35:30.088 --> 00:35:31.632
I-I'll just work a lot harder.

539
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.051
<i>I'll just work a lot harder.</i>

540
00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:35.719
You can't do this by yourself.

541
00:35:37.221 --> 00:35:38.639
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, you...</i>

542
00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.074
<i>No, you're not going back to work.</i>

543
00:35:40.098 --> 00:35:41.683
<i>You heard what the doctor said.</i>

544
00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:42.827
There's a chance you could lose the baby.

545
00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:44.061
If I don't go back to work,

546
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:46.021
there's a chance we could lose the house.

547
00:35:47.814 --> 00:35:50.251
<i>Mallard's supposed to level me up
any day now. Any day now.</i>

548
00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:53.487
They've been telling you
the same thing for years,

549
00:35:55.364 --> 00:35:56.823
<i>and you still believe them?</i>

550
00:35:58.158 --> 00:35:59.284
<i>Yes.</i>

551
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:01.036
Yes.

552
00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:05.082
The question is,
do you still believe in me?

553
00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:10.128
This child of ours
is gonna have a better life

554
00:36:10.212 --> 00:36:11.797
than any of us ever did.

555
00:36:17.052 --> 00:36:18.720
Is this what better feels like?

556
00:36:29.314 --> 00:36:32.109
<i>Joe, today's performance
serves as an exemplar</i>

557
00:36:32.192 --> 00:36:33.944
<i>of your ever-ascending capabilities.</i>

558
00:36:34.027 --> 00:36:35.153
Hell, yeah.

559
00:36:38.031 --> 00:36:39.324
Is that what you wanted?

560
00:36:39.408 --> 00:36:40.468
<i>By embracing the challenge</i>

561
00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:41.869
<i>of exploring your limits,</i>

562
00:36:41.952 --> 00:36:43.120
<i>you are forging a path</i>

563
00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:44.955
<i>toward the promise of
your innate potential,</i>

564
00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:48.417
<i>perpetuating the cycle
of growth and self-discovery.</i>

565
00:36:57.384 --> 00:36:58.385
Hey.

566
00:36:59.803 --> 00:37:01.221
Hey, you-you there?

567
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.934
Hey. Who's Alex?

568
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.022
Who?

569
00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:11.440
You heard me. Alex.

570
00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:13.734
Who is that?

571
00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:17.404
How do you know about Alex?

572
00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:21.783
W... Was he the, was he the smug guy?

573
00:37:22.117 --> 00:37:24.703
Was he, was he the guy
that-that was here before me?

574
00:37:25.287 --> 00:37:30.083
Yeah, um, Alex is
a bit of a legend around here.

575
00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:32.044
He's the guy who got out.

576
00:37:35.672 --> 00:37:36.757
He escaped?

577
00:37:37.925 --> 00:37:39.051
He got out.

578
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:42.387
So wait, wait, wait. He got out.

579
00:37:46.934 --> 00:37:48.602
How is this place still operating?

580
00:37:51.605 --> 00:37:53.565
He didn't tell anyone about this place?

581
00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:55.567
I don't know.

582
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:56.902
Maybe he didn't want to.

583
00:37:58.195 --> 00:37:59.321
Maybe he couldn't.

584
00:38:00.656 --> 00:38:02.282
Bullshit.

585
00:38:05.035 --> 00:38:07.704
I know if I left this motherfucker,
I'd tell everybody.

586
00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:31.854
<i>Good morning, Joe.</i>

587
00:38:32.187 --> 00:38:35.941
<i>Congratulations. You performed
excellent work yesterday.</i>

588
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:38.277
<i>We thank you for your incredible efforts.</i>

589
00:38:43.532 --> 00:38:45.742
<i>Please accept
this token of our appreciation</i>

590
00:38:45.826 --> 00:38:47.786
<i>to commemorate your amazing achievement.</i>

591
00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.381
Oh.

592
00:39:01.341 --> 00:39:02.342
A pen.

593
00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:05.971
<i>Not just any pen, look closer.</i>

594
00:39:09.933 --> 00:39:11.643
Ohh!

595
00:39:11.727 --> 00:39:12.936
Wow.

596
00:39:13.812 --> 00:39:15.272
You guys

597
00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:18.483
engraved, engraved my name in the pen.

598
00:39:18.567 --> 00:39:19.776
Wow, this is...

599
00:39:20.485 --> 00:39:22.529
I mean, this is, uh...

600
00:39:23.739 --> 00:39:25.324
This is fuckin' stupid!

601
00:39:26.116 --> 00:39:28.493
A fucking pen? What am I gonna do
with this shit?

602
00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:31.413
I don't even have
any fuckin' paper around here.

603
00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:32.956
Huh?

604
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.210
Fuck y'all, man, fuckin'...

605
00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:40.923
370?

606
00:39:42.216 --> 00:39:43.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

607
00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.427
This was just 50 yesterday.

608
00:39:46.094 --> 00:39:47.971
<i>Do you wish to file a complaint?</i>

609
00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:52.226
Look, I can't... I can't do that again.

610
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:54.436
<i>People don't know
what they're capable of.</i>

611
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.563
<i>They cling to their limiting beliefs,</i>

612
00:39:56.647 --> 00:39:59.483
<i>never knowing that
just beyond their doubts is greatness.</i>

613
00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.401
<i>Like children, they just need a push.</i>

614
00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:03.880
Look, look, I can't do that many again.

615
00:40:03.904 --> 00:40:06.365
You see me? Look at my fuckin' hands.

616
00:40:06.448 --> 00:40:09.868
<i>It's hard, Joe,
but so is changing the world.</i>

617
00:40:10.118 --> 00:40:13.455
<i>That's what we're doing,
all of us together.</i>

618
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.458
<i>Now would be a great time
to take the first step</i>

619
00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:18.293
<i>towards an even better future.</i>

620
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:23.090
Fuck you!

621
00:40:24.925 --> 00:40:27.553
Fuck you, and fuck that fuckin' pen!

622
00:40:29.763 --> 00:40:30.889
Fuck!

623
00:41:15.017 --> 00:41:16.185
Hey, I-I...

624
00:41:17.895 --> 00:41:19.646
I went past the green mark, and it...

625
00:41:21.023 --> 00:41:22.900
It didn't, it didn't give me my point.

626
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.738
Are y'all fuckin' with me?

627
00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:30.908
Huh?

628
00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:32.551
Hey, man, what's the problem?

629
00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:35.370
It's not giving me my points.

630
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:38.040
Oh, shit,
dude, are you in penalty?

631
00:41:38.457 --> 00:41:39.458
What?

632
00:41:40.209 --> 00:41:41.919
Penalty. What-what's that?

633
00:41:42.002 --> 00:41:43.188
The middle of the scoreboard.

634
00:41:43.212 --> 00:41:45.506
Look. Is there a little X?

635
00:41:47.007 --> 00:41:48.008
Yeah, it is.

636
00:41:48.091 --> 00:41:49.510
Those are your penalties.

637
00:41:49.885 --> 00:41:52.596
They're a bitch, and they're exponential.

638
00:41:53.222 --> 00:41:54.342
Wait, wait, wait.

639
00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:56.225
Penalty. How did I,
how did I get a penalty?

640
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.101
Alright, look. One X means

641
00:41:58.185 --> 00:42:00.854
it takes two revolutions
to score one point.

642
00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:05.067
Two X's, it's four revolutions,
and then eight, and then 16.

643
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.153
Then, well, shit, at that point,
you might as well give up.

644
00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:09.238
Hey.

645
00:42:10.322 --> 00:42:11.615
Hey, that's impossible.

646
00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.493
You expect me to do double the work?

647
00:42:19.122 --> 00:42:20.374
Oh, fuck!

648
00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:23.377
<i>Human history
is a story of chaos,</i>

649
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.421
<i>war, disease, nations falling.</i>

650
00:42:26.922 --> 00:42:30.259
<i>Do you really trust your hard-earned money
to a failing government?</i>

651

Hey, Joe.

659
00:44:15.405 --> 00:44:17.366
Everything okay in there, man?

660
00:44:17.449 --> 00:44:18.909
You've been real quiet today.

661
00:44:20.827 --> 00:44:22.120
I can't hit it.

662
00:44:22.496 --> 00:44:24.331
Oh, come on, you have to.

663
00:44:24.414 --> 00:44:25.791
We covered this.

664
00:44:29.169 --> 00:44:30.212
I can't.

665
00:44:31.672 --> 00:44:32.840
I can't.

666
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:36.343
I could do 370, but I can't.

667
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.804
Not-not with the penalty, you know.

668
00:44:39.221 --> 00:44:42.182
Wait, penalty 3-370?

669
00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:45.352
So you-you have... you have 740?

670
00:44:46.395 --> 00:44:48.564
700 and fucking 40?

671
00:44:49.189 --> 00:44:50.858
- 740?
- How much?

672
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:52.067
Fuck, Joe,

673
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.694
what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

674
00:44:53.777 --> 00:44:54.778
You asshole.

675
00:44:54.862 --> 00:44:56.655
You're gonna get us fucking killed!

676
00:44:56.738 --> 00:44:58.365
Are you fucking kidding me?!

677
00:44:58.448 --> 00:45:01.577
Told you, do not burn yourself out!

678
00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.122
I told you, man, not to fuck with Mallard,

679
00:45:05.205 --> 00:45:06.832
and you didn't fucking listen!

680
00:45:06.915 --> 00:45:08.333
- Shut up.
- Goddamn you!

681
00:45:08.417 --> 00:45:09.626
- You didn't listen.
- Shut up!

682
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.169
You fucking idiot.

683
00:45:11.253 --> 00:45:15.549
You hit 740, and now we have to hit 740.

684
00:45:15.924 --> 00:45:18.010
Don't you understand?

685
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.513
We're paying for your fucking mistakes!

686
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:24.933
Fuck you, Joe! Fuck you!

687
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.272
<i>The time is now 10 o'clock.</i>

688
00:45:30.814 --> 00:45:32.816
<i>Your work is complete for the day.</i>

689
00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:35.569
<i>You did not meet your daily quota.</i>

690
00:45:39.907 --> 00:45:41.116
You gave me a penalty.

691
00:45:41.575 --> 00:45:43.202
<i>You gave it to yourself.</i>

692
00:45:43.535 --> 00:45:45.537
<i>You let down your fellow employees.</i>

693
00:45:45.996 --> 00:45:47.414
<i>Care for your fellow workers</i>

694
00:45:47.497 --> 00:45:49.333
<i>is one of our core company values.</i>

695
00:45:51.501 --> 00:45:52.711
Values.

696
00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:56.215
<i>Clearly, we haven't given you
the proper motivation.</i>

697
00:45:56.715 --> 00:45:58.675
<i>Perhaps you need a new coworker.</i>

698
00:46:08.477 --> 00:46:09.645
What is this?

699
00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.522
<i>Kate Stevens.</i>

700
00:46:11.605 --> 00:46:13.982
No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

701
00:46:14.525 --> 00:46:16.252
No, she's... she's not even
supposed to be on her feet.

702
00:46:16.276 --> 00:46:18.046
<i>Data collected
from your Mallard home</i>

703
00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.780
<i>indicates her lack of employment.</i>

704
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.990
<i>Perhaps we could solve all your problems</i>

705
00:46:22.074 --> 00:46:24.451
<i>by offering her a job... here.</i>

706
00:46:24.535 --> 00:46:26.286
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

707
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.139
She's... she's not supposed
to be walking around.

708
00:46:28.163 --> 00:46:31.083
<i>Our Mallard team
will gladly aid in her relocation.</i>

709
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.751
Kate...

710
00:46:32.834 --> 00:46:34.002
Not Kate.

711
00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:36.421
She don't need to be here, okay?

712
00:46:36.505 --> 00:46:37.798
She don't deserve this.

713
00:46:38.674 --> 00:46:40.759
Hey, hey, I'll do better.

714
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.803
I'll do... I'll do better.

715
00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:44.263
I'll-I'll-I'll do everything.

716
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:45.931
I-I-I'll get the 740.

717
00:46:46.014 --> 00:46:47.659
I'll do whatever you need me to do.
Just don't...

718
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:48.725
Please, just don't...

719
00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:50.561
Don't-don't bring her here, please.

720
00:46:50.644 --> 00:46:52.204
Please, please, please, please, please.

721
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:53.939
<i>That's wonderful to hear.</i>

722
00:46:54.273 --> 00:46:57.359
<i>Meet your quota tomorrow
and the penalty will go away.</i>

723
00:46:57.442 --> 00:46:59.778
<i>We are pleased to present you
with an additional challenge</i>

724
00:46:59.862 --> 00:47:01.196

<i>We hope this challenge
will serve as further motivation</i>

727
00:47:06.702 --> 00:47:08.245
<i>for you to continue pushing yourself</i>

728
00:47:08.328 --> 00:47:09.913
<i>towards achieving your goals.</i>

729
00:47:10.497 --> 00:47:13.208
<i>Thank you for your commitment
to self-improvement, Joe.</i>

730
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:51.914
You gonna roast me?

731
00:47:53.373 --> 00:47:54.374
Huh?

732
00:48:28.742 --> 00:48:29.952
Fuck.

733
00:48:30.452 --> 00:48:32.329
<i>This evening's termination is</i>

734
00:48:32.412 --> 00:48:34.540
<i>graciously presented by Mallard Travel.</i>

739
00:49:26.341 --> 00:49:27.551
Oh, shit.

740
00:49:54.953 --> 00:49:56.330
<i>Good morning, Joe.</i>

741
00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.165
<i>Sleep well?</i>

742
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.000
I've had better.

743
00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:03.003
<i>Remember until we are challenged,</i>

744
00:50:03.128 --> 00:50:05.130
<i>we don't really know what we can achieve.</i>

745
00:50:05.714 --> 00:50:08.342
<i>Take advantage of today's opportunity
for growth.</i>

746
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.552
<i>Give it 110%.</i>

747
00:50:11.053 --> 00:50:12.804
<i>Make this a productive day.</i>

748
00:52:13.383 --> 00:52:16.637
<i>Mallard man, look at you now.</i>

749
00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:21.642
Hey, Joe.

750
00:52:27.022 --> 00:52:28.023
Ooh.

751
00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:29.608
You really, uh,

752
00:52:30.734 --> 00:52:32.414
really outdid your did yourself this time.

753
00:52:32.986 --> 00:52:37.282
Dusty, stank in', dirty-ass fucking jail.

754
00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:40.619
Please, just, please,
just, just, just go, okay?

755
00:52:42.579 --> 00:52:43.747
I'm so close.

756
00:52:44.873 --> 00:52:46.833
So you consider this close?

757
00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.712
You, you think that you're close?

758
00:52:50.796 --> 00:52:52.357
Just, just go,
just please, please, please.

759
00:52:52.381 --> 00:52:53.900
Let me finish. Just let me finish
my work, please.

760
00:52:53.924 --> 00:52:55.467
Ah, there you go, Joe.

761
00:52:56.802 --> 00:52:59.346
Believing that bullshit, hmm?

762
00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:03.642
Mm-hmm, your entire life,
you've been telling yourself,

763
00:53:04.226 --> 00:53:07.187
"Oh, you the man, Joe, and you can do it.

764
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:08.564
"You just gotta push yourself,

765
00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:10.941
and they're gonna reward you someday."

766
00:53:12.776 --> 00:53:14.778
The same bullshit.

767
00:53:16.947 --> 00:53:18.115
Huh?

768
00:53:18.198 --> 00:53:19.324
Has it worked for you?

769
00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:24.288
Huh, Joe? Has it, has it
ever worked for you?

770
00:53:25.455 --> 00:53:26.599
Just keep going.

771
00:53:26.623 --> 00:53:27.708
You fucked up.

772
00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.422
You believed in something
that didn't believe in you.

773
00:53:34.339 --> 00:53:35.632
And now look at you.

774
00:53:36.466 --> 00:53:37.676
You're fucked.

775
00:53:39.595 --> 00:53:40.679
You should just quit.

776
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.140
Come on now. We know how this ends.

777
00:53:45.058 --> 00:53:46.143
You can't win.

778
00:53:48.854 --> 00:53:50.063
You won't win.

779
00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:52.733
You won't fuckin' win!

780
00:53:54.026 --> 00:53:56.945
You fucked Kate over, left her all alone

781
00:53:57.029 --> 00:53:59.323
with a baby
that you'll never fucking meet!

782
00:53:59.406 --> 00:54:01.491
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- That's right.

783
00:54:01.575 --> 00:54:03.911
Your son will grow up without a father.

784
00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:07.873
- Not true.
- Maybe it's a good thing.

785
00:54:09.458 --> 00:54:11.919
- I'm gonna be a father to my son.
- Just fuckin' stop.

786
00:54:12.002 --> 00:54:13.670
I will be a father to my son.

787
00:54:13.754 --> 00:54:14.796
Just fuckin' quit!

788
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.381
I will be a father to my son.

789
00:54:16.465 --> 00:54:17.466
You won't win!

790
00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:19.676
- Just quit!
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

791
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.488
- Just fuckin' quit!
- Fuck you, fuck you.

792
00:54:21.512 --> 00:54:23.180
Just stop!

793
00:54:25.807 --> 00:54:26.934
<i>Fuck you!</i>

794
00:54:41.782 --> 00:54:43.033
<i>Just fuckin' quit!</i>

795
00:54:56.296 --> 00:54:58.924
<i>Just fuckin' quit!</i>

796
00:55:08.141 --> 00:55:12.145
<i>Joe, in successfully
accomplishing the designated quota,</i>

797
00:55:12.229 --> 00:55:15.649
<i>you have effectively nullified
the previously imposed penalty.</i>

798
00:55:16.233 --> 00:55:17.693
<i>It is our fervent hope that,</i>

799
00:55:17.776 --> 00:55:19.486
<i>within the crucible of adversity,</i>

800
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.488
<i>you have unearthed newfound resilience.</i>

801
00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:16.585
That's right.

802
00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:18.337
Yeah.

803
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:20.088
Yeah.

804
00:56:21.048 --> 00:56:22.257
Yeah.

805
00:56:23.926 --> 00:56:25.093
Yeah.

806
00:56:26.053 --> 00:56:27.304
Yeah!

807
00:56:30.307 --> 00:56:31.683
You won't break me.

808
00:56:35.145 --> 00:56:37.898
<i>Your improvement
in productivity is remarkable.</i>

809
00:56:37.981 --> 00:56:39.358
<i>You should have great pride</i>

810
00:56:39.441 --> 00:56:41.360
<i>in the work ethic you displayed today.</i>

811
00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:45.447
When do I go home?

812
00:56:45.531 --> 00:56:46.891
<i>You are well on your way.</i>

813
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:49.451
<i>All of us at Mallard believe in you.</i>

814
00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:52.913
<i>Please accept a token of appreciation
for today's hard work.</i>

815
00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:56.250
What, another fuckin' pen?

816
00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:57.376
<i>No.</i>

817
00:56:57.918 --> 00:56:59.086
<i>Motivation.</i>

818
00:57:00.504 --> 00:57:02.714
My God.

819
00:57:18.063 --> 00:57:20.023
<i>Congratulations, dad.</i>

820
00:57:20.399 --> 00:57:21.483
No, no.

821
00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:23.944
I didn't...

822
00:57:24.236 --> 00:57:25.612
How could I miss this?

823
00:57:26.905 --> 00:57:28.323
How long have I been here?

824
00:57:30.158 --> 00:57:31.636
<i>This moment
has been brought to you</i>

825
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.079
<i>by the friendly faces
at Mallard Kids Wear.</i>

826
00:57:34.538 --> 00:57:36.832
<i>From the moment you're born,
Mallard is there.</i>

827
00:57:36.915 --> 00:57:38.795
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No, no.

828
00:57:38.834 --> 00:57:40.085
Turn it back on.

829
00:57:40.878 --> 00:57:42.254
Can I, can I see 'em again?

830
00:57:44.006 --> 00:57:45.007
Please?

831
00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:53.223
I'm a dad.

832
00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.353
Oh, man, I'm a dad.

833
00:58:50.864 --> 00:58:52.783
Shit, man.

834
00:59:04.294 --> 00:59:05.295
Hey.

835
00:59:08.006 --> 00:59:09.007
Hey.

836
00:59:11.134 --> 00:59:12.261
Hey!

837
00:59:12.886 --> 00:59:14.304
Morning, neighbor.

838
00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:16.390
I guess someone hit his quota.

839
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:18.642
Hey, man, fuck you!

840
00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:20.185
Oh, boy.

841
00:59:20.269 --> 00:59:21.395
Woke up on the wrong side of

842
00:59:21.478 --> 00:59:22.798
the dirt patch this morning, huh?

843
00:59:22.855 --> 00:59:24.457
See, you think everything a fuckin' joke?

844
00:59:24.481 --> 00:59:25.691
Okay, I'm serious.

845
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:29.862
I need that information
on how Alex got outta here.

846
00:59:30.445 --> 00:59:31.738
- Why?
- Look, okay?

847
00:59:35.075 --> 00:59:36.702
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

848
00:59:40.455 --> 00:59:42.291
Last night, they showed a video

849
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:46.587
of my wife, Kate,

850
00:59:48.463 --> 00:59:49.590
having our son.

851
00:59:51.091 --> 00:59:53.468
If you know anything,
please just let me know.

852
01:00:03.896 --> 01:00:06.899
You know, I have a family, too.

853
01:00:08.567 --> 01:00:10.235
I-I have a son,

854
01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:13.822
and he would be, um...

855
01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.575
Shit, I don't, I don't even know. Older?

856
01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.620
I guess old enough to hate me.

857
01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:24.625
But, uh, I got to hold my son
when he was born.

858
01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.378
I got to watch
him take his first steps.

859
01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:31.465
I heard him call me "dad."

860
01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:34.927
That's the difference
between you and me, Joe.

861
01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.056
And I just wish I could see him again.

862
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.519
Actually, maybe I don't.

863
01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:48.398
Maybe what I actually hope
is that every day he wakes up

864
01:00:48.482 --> 01:00:51.777
thinking about the father
who chose work over him.

865
01:00:52.152 --> 01:00:55.197
Maybe I hope he knows
that I'm a fucking asshole,

866
01:00:55.447 --> 01:00:59.910
and I hope he grows up hating me enough
to be nothing like me.

867
01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:02.496
And I don't want
that for you, man.

868
01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:04.915
So, fuck it.

869
01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:06.667
On the opposite wall,

870
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.669
In that blind spot behind the pillar,

871
01:01:08.794 --> 01:01:10.379
you'll know it when you see it.

872
01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:12.589
Thank you.

873
01:01:13.173 --> 01:01:14.174
Good luck, man.

874
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.779
I don't fuckin' see anything.

875
01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:52.004
Hmm.

876
01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:00.137
Oh, shit.

877
01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:02.806
Wait, wait, wait.

878
01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:07.811
Wait a minute.

879
01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:14.735
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

880
01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:27.998
Okay, see past the pillar.

881
01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:33.837
That goddamn pen.

882
01:02:35.172 --> 01:02:37.299
That motherfuckin' pen.

883
01:03:36.692 --> 01:03:38.360
Oh, these cheap motherfuckers.

884
01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:40.279
They didn't even patch this shit up.

885
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:14.766
<i>Where the art
of gourmet indulgence</i>

886
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:17.543

seamlessly intertwine.</i>

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:19.253

01:05:28.679 --> 01:05:30.472
<i>encapsulating the essence of luxury.</i>

891
01:05:52.953 --> 01:05:54.162
Tonight is the night.

892
01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.916
What's the plan?

893
01:05:58.834 --> 01:06:00.252
I don't... I don't know.

894
01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:01.895
I didn't know I was gonna get this far.

895
01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:05.656
I guess I'm just gonna have to see.

896
01:07:20.499 --> 01:07:21.500
Oh, no.

897
01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.835
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

898
01:07:23.919 --> 01:07:24.920
Shit.

899
01:07:34.221 --> 01:07:35.973
- Oh, shit.
- Nighty night.

900
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.500
No.

901
01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:05.335
No. No.

902
01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:06.753
No. No.

903
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:11.592
No.

904
01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:19.641
Fuck!

905
01:08:20.851 --> 01:08:21.977
No!

906
01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.783
<i>I thought you were growing, Joe.</i>

907
01:08:37.326 --> 01:08:39.006
<i>But I can see that you still don't believe</i>

908
01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:40.329
<i>the rules apply to you.</i>

909
01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:42.372
<i>You have so much promise,</i>

910
01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:45.125
<i>and there's been a substantial investment
made in you.</i>

911
01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.878
<i>That's why we are offering you
another opportunity</i>

912
01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:49.880
<i>despite your behavior last night.</i>

913
01:08:49.963 --> 01:08:52.049
<i>You are so focused on your own interests</i>

914
01:08:52.132 --> 01:08:53.967
<i>that you are missing the big picture.</i>

915
01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:57.221
<i>Perhaps you would respond
to other incentives.</i>

916
01:08:58.263 --> 01:08:59.765
The fuck else can you do?

917
01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:04.770
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
The fuck is this?

918
01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.230
Hey, hey. Hey!

919
01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:09.566
Ow, fuck! Oh, God!

920
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.859
Oh, what the fuck?

921
01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:12.423
<i>Your accomplice
has now been punished.</i>

922
01:09:13.654 --> 01:09:14.923
<i>The quota for our entire workforce</i>

923
01:09:14.947 --> 01:09:15.948
<i>has been raised</i>

924
01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:18.200
<i>to 1,000 revolutions per day.</i>

925
01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:20.452
<i>Your workday will begin in five minutes.</i>

926
01:09:20.536 --> 01:09:21.537
A thousand?

927
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:22.680
<i>Good luck.</i>

928
01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:23.765
Impossible!

929
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:26.500
Oh, no. No. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

930
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:27.584
You-you okay?

931
01:09:27.668 --> 01:09:29.336
I can't stand, man!

932
01:09:30.295 --> 01:09:32.339
They broke my fucking leg!

933
01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:35.342
It's busted to shit! Motherfucker.

934
01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:37.970
Oh, shit. Look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.

935
01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:39.531
I can't do a fuckin' 1,000, man.

936
01:09:39.555 --> 01:09:41.098
I can't even do one.

937
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.808
I can't fucking stand.

938
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:44.852
I'm so sorry, man.
I didn't... I didn't mean to.

939
01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:47.229
But you, but you, but you got to.
You can do this, man.

940
01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:48.414
You got, you have no choice.

941
01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:50.524
I can't, man. It's fucking over!

942
01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:53.694
There aren't fucking sick days here, man.

943
01:09:53.777 --> 01:09:55.863
It's a zero-sum game. Trust me.

944
01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:57.948
We aren't in charge in here.

945
01:09:58.031 --> 01:09:59.491
The fucking algorithms are.

946
01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:01.326
They make all the fucking decisions.

947
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.288
They built this place. They run the whole
fucking system.

948
01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:05.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

949
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:08.375
We-we're controlled by a computer?

950
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:09.894
Oh, my God.

951
01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:14.506
You wanna know the best part, Joe?

952
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:15.591
What?

953
01:10:16.633 --> 01:10:18.302
I helped them build it.

954
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.139
I was in IT.

955
01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:25.434
They wanted us
to get the fucking numbers up,

956
01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.519
so we built the algorithm.

957
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.272
It was a language and reasoning model

958
01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:32.107
like no one had ever seen before.

959
01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:35.027
It was the kind of shit
that nobody outside of Mallard

960
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.237
would even believe could exist.

961
01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.072
And-and then guess what?

962
01:10:39.656 --> 01:10:43.827
Our algorithm, it built its own algorithm,

963
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:46.288
which then built its own algorithm.

964
01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:50.292
And we don't even know
how it fucking works anymore.

965
01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:53.837
But it got me promoted, so, yay.

966
01:10:55.964 --> 01:10:57.724
Then I started to wonder
if that shit running

967
01:10:57.799 --> 01:11:00.344
the world's most powerful
multinational corporation

968
01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:01.970
was such a good idea.

969
01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:06.099
I guess, I-I shouldn't have
wondered that out loud.

970
01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:11.188
You can't reason with an equation, man.

971
01:11:13.524 --> 01:11:14.942
It's just an algorithm.

972
01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:18.946
It's just a computer.

973
01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:24.284
Wait a minute.

974
01:11:25.327 --> 01:11:29.915
A computer has to follow... the rules.

975
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:33.168
What the fuck
are you talking about?

976
01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:37.047
Look, this-this could be a long shot, but,

977
01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:41.844
if we don't work, right,

978
01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:44.763
and a computer goes exactly by the rules,

979
01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:46.223
like none of us work,

980
01:11:46.306 --> 01:11:49.101
that means zero points
for anybody on the scoreboard.

981
01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:53.397
No-nobody dies, right?

982
01:11:53.939 --> 01:11:55.524
Uh, I mean, yeah.

983
01:11:55.607 --> 01:11:57.693
I guess in, in theory,
if there's not a low man,

984
01:11:57.776 --> 01:12:00.237
it could, I guess, exploit a vulnerability

985
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.798
in the programming language or something,

986
01:12:01.822 --> 01:12:02.990
but... but what...

987
01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:04.575
Wait, what if that doesn't work?

988
01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:08.871
What do we have to lose?

989
01:12:09.538 --> 01:12:12.207
<i>You have two minutes
before your workday begins.</i>

990
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.210
Okay. Okay. Hey.

991
01:12:15.294 --> 01:12:17.730
Shut the fuck up, Joe.

992
01:12:17.754 --> 01:12:19.798
Just-just hear me out real quick, okay?

993
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.969
Look, what they have us doing,

994
01:12:24.803 --> 01:12:26.471
it's no end game to it.

995
01:12:28.182 --> 01:12:30.726
There is no way we can beat this shit

996
01:12:30.809 --> 01:12:32.811
by the system they got us working for.

997
01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:33.955
Shut the fuck up.

998
01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:37.608
Pushing this big fuckin' stone, wooden...

999
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:38.960
I don't even know what the fuck this is...

1000
01:12:38.984 --> 01:12:40.152
Shut the fuck up!

1001
01:12:40.235 --> 01:12:42.571
Around for hours and hours of the day,

1002
01:12:42.821 --> 01:12:46.283
basically killing us one by one!

1003
01:12:47.159 --> 01:12:49.953
We're being controlled
by a fuckin' machine!

1004
01:12:50.204 --> 01:12:53.207
- Fuck the duck.
- Yeah! Fuck the duck!

1005
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.000
We are people!

1006
01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:58.128
We're more than just numbers.

1007
01:12:58.545 --> 01:13:00.714
We're flesh and fuckin' blood.

1008
01:13:02.299 --> 01:13:04.259
And we could take this motherfucker out,

1009
01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:07.346
but we all gotta stick together, okay?

1010
01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:09.973
<i>You have one minute

1011
01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:12.059
If we don't work,

1012
01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:15.312
we won't die!

1013
01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.438
Yeah!

1014
01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:19.483

1015
01:13:20.025 --> 01:13:21.860

1053
01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:03.921

Stop! Please, don't do this.

1067
01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:54.471
Don't let them win!

1068
01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:58.475
We... we won't die, okay?

1069
01:15:58.559 --> 01:16:00.853
They can't win if we stick together!

1070
01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:02.729
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?

1071
01:16:02.813 --> 01:16:04.398
Stop!

1072
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:05.524
Fuck!

1073
01:16:05.607 --> 01:16:06.900
We gotta stick together!

1074
01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:08.277
Stop it.

1075
01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.653
Stop it!

1076
01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.655
Stop it!

1077
01:16:12.531 --> 01:16:13.740
Stop!

1078
01:16:14.825 --> 01:16:15.868
Joe.

1079
01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:19.204
Come here.

1080
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.875
Stop it. Stop. Stop, y'all.

1081
01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:24.877
Come on. Stop working.

1082
01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:26.896
You know what you have to do.

1083
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.380
We agreed. Come on.

1084
01:16:30.174 --> 01:16:31.175
No.

1085
01:16:32.009 --> 01:16:33.552
No, no, no.

1086
01:16:34.094 --> 01:16:35.429
No, no, no.

1087
01:16:36.221 --> 01:16:38.432
No, I can't do it. I can't do it, man.

1088
01:16:38.515 --> 01:16:40.267
- Joe.
- I-I-I can't.

1089
01:16:40.934 --> 01:16:42.936
- I can't.
- Joe, man, it's alright.

1090
01:16:43.687 --> 01:16:45.189
You tried. You...

1091
01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.356
You did good.

1092
01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:48.400
You're a good man.

1093
01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:52.946
JJ is a lucky kid.

1094
01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:56.992
You're gonna be such a good dad, Joe.

1095
01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:01.622
Now, do what you need to do
and get the fuck out of here

1096
01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:03.290
so you can meet your son.

1097
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.130
I'm sorry, man.

1098
01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:01.909
Hey.

1099
01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:06.538
Have you ever noticed how beautiful this
sky is at night?

1100
01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:10.125
Uh...

1101
01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:11.752
I had never noticed it before.

1102
01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.173
I could have been looking up
this whole fuckin' time.

1103
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.598
I'm gonna die a cliché, Joe.

1104
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:27.476
No, you won't.

1105
01:19:32.022 --> 01:19:33.398
This is gon' baffle me forever,

1106
01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:35.150
so you gotta answer this question.

1107
01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:37.402
What is your name?

1108
01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:40.531
Uh... nope. Mm-mm.

1109
01:19:40.614 --> 01:19:41.823
Remember the rules?

1110
01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:44.451
- I don't do names.
- Enough of that bullshit.

1111
01:19:44.535 --> 01:19:46.787
Look, I know you
don't do names, but, come on.

1112
01:19:47.329 --> 01:19:48.664
You-you gotta tell me.

1113
01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:56.380
Alex.

1114
01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:01.260
Nah.

1115
01:20:05.013 --> 01:20:07.140
Alex, the name engraved...

1116
01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:10.185
You're, you're the Alex?

1117
01:20:10.853 --> 01:20:11.854
Yep.

1118
01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.480
Surprise!

1119
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.066
Man, wh...

1120
01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:18.277
Why-why you ain't tell nobody?

1121
01:20:20.028 --> 01:20:21.738
I told you, man, I couldn't.

1122
01:20:23.282 --> 01:20:24.783
I got out of my cell.

1123
01:20:25.284 --> 01:20:26.743
I thought I was in the clear,

1124
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:30.706
and then I just got tossed
right back in, just like you.

1125
01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:33.917
I thought maybe with you that,
I don't know,

1126
01:20:34.918 --> 01:20:36.837
it would be different.

1127
01:20:37.504 --> 01:20:39.173
I thought that I was just unlucky,

1128
01:20:39.256 --> 01:20:42.551
but turns out
maybe we're all fucked, right?

1129
01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:43.927
There's no escape.

1130
01:20:44.261 --> 01:20:48.348
This is just some kinda loop,
an eternal recurrence,

1131
01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:52.227
a return to the very
worst moment of your life

1132
01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:55.480
over and over and over again.

1133
01:20:58.609 --> 01:21:00.527
The only regret I have is

1134
01:21:00.777 --> 01:21:03.614
that I never figured out a way
to burn this place down.

1135
01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:09.953
You should get some sleep, man.

1136
01:21:11.663 --> 01:21:13.498
You've gotta get back to it tomorrow.

1137
01:21:22.341 --> 01:21:23.717
Farewell, my friend.

1138
01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:55.332
Alright, fuckers,
just get me the fuck outta here already.

1139
01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:59.837
Come on, you cancerous fucks,
give me your best shot.

1140
01:22:01.296 --> 01:22:02.381
Fuck you!

1141
01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.758
Oh! Oh! Oh, f...

1142
01:22:06.844 --> 01:22:08.345
Fucking assholes!

1143
01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:09.555
Fuck Mallard!

1144
01:22:09.638 --> 01:22:10.931
Oh!

1145
01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:18.021
Shit! Ohh!

1146
01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:22.442
Oh, my God.

1147
01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:24.069
Ow, shit!

1148
01:22:24.152 --> 01:22:26.029
Ow, fuck!

1149
01:22:26.113 --> 01:22:27.507
<i>This evening's termination</i>

1150
01:22:27.531 --> 01:22:29.241

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.673
No, I couldn't be here that long.

Fuck you.

1161
01:23:37.976 --> 01:23:39.645
Fuck you.

Fuck you!

1163

Fuck you!

1164

<i>You don't seem

1165

Fuck you! You took everything from me!

01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:49.488
You took everything from me! Fuck you!

1167
01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:51.532
<i>This behavior is unacceptable.</i>

1168
01:23:51.615 --> 01:23:53.742
I've done so much
for this fuckin' company.

1169
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:58.830
I sacrificed so much,
and you took everything from me!

1170
01:24:00.123 --> 01:24:01.542
Everything!

1171
01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.418
Fuck this!

1172

<i>Damage to company property</i>

1173
01:24:04.962 --> 01:24:06.231
<i>will result in immediate termination.</i>

1174
01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:08.966
I don't give a fuck no more!

1175
01:24:09.049 --> 01:24:10.634
<i>You are leaving us no option.</i>

1176
01:24:10.717 --> 01:24:11.969
What the fuck you gonna do?

1177
01:24:12.052 --> 01:24:14.054
<i>You're a productive worker, Joe,</i>

<i>Good luck, Joe.</i>

1184

Hey.

Hey, hey, hey.

1186
01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.111
Hey, um...

1187
01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:12.863
Hey, hey, hey.

1188
01:25:12.946 --> 01:25:13.947
Who...?

1189
01:25:14.615 --> 01:25:15.908
What's going on, huh?

1190
01:25:17.117 --> 01:25:19.536
Can somebody tell me
what-what's-what's going on?

1191
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.496
Hey, anybody?

1192
01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:23.790
Come on, come on. Talk to me. Come...

1193
01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:25.834
What's going on?

1194
01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.140
Please tell me what the fuck is happenin'.

1195
01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:30.339
Why am I fuckin' here?

1196
01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:32.341
Huh?

1197
01:25:33.926 --> 01:25:36.053
Somebody say...
Somebody talk to me, please.

1198
01:25:36.762 --> 01:25:38.889
Talk-talk to me. Talk to me, please.
What's going on?

1199
01:25:38.972 --> 01:25:40.492
Please talk to me. Talk... Somebody...

1200
01:25:40.516 --> 01:25:42.267
Why the fuck y'all not talking back?

1201
01:25:42.643 --> 01:25:43.894
What's going on?

1202
01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:45.562
Huh?

1203
01:25:46.396 --> 01:25:48.023
Who the fuck runs this shit, huh?

1204
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.859
Who's controlling
the fuckin' computer, huh?

1205
01:25:51.151 --> 01:25:52.611
Who's controlling the duck?

1206
01:25:52.694 --> 01:25:53.946
Talk to me!

1207
01:25:55.197 --> 01:25:57.074
What the fuck is going on?

1208
01:25:57.783 --> 01:25:58.867
Huh?

1209
01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:22.558
Hiya, Joe.

1210
01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:24.393
Happy Mallard morning.

1211
01:26:31.316 --> 01:26:32.609
I love my job.

1212
01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:36.530
Every goddamn part.

1213
01:26:41.743 --> 01:26:43.495
But there is nothing,

1214
01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:48.792
nothing I love more than a termination.

1215
01:26:53.839 --> 01:26:55.132
You meet the team?

1216
01:26:56.633 --> 01:26:57.759
Human resources.

1217
01:26:59.469 --> 01:27:02.556
12 witnesses to each termination.

1218
01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:04.099
Everything's documented.

1219
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:07.311
After all,
we're a publicly traded company,

1220
01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:10.772
and everyone
is part of the Mallard family.

1221
01:27:16.361 --> 01:27:18.488
Now what is it with you management types?

1222
01:27:21.033 --> 01:27:23.285
I mean, Mallard has given
you the whole world,

1223
01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:25.162
but you still want more.

1224
01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:30.125
And, you know,

1225
01:27:31.627 --> 01:27:33.295
I have my annual review coming up.

1226
01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:36.590
Maybe Mallard will level me up.

1227
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.011
They might even move me
to Mallard Crossings.

1228
01:27:44.765 --> 01:27:46.558
I hear there'll be a vacancy soon.

1229
01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:51.939
Yeah, 1431 Parkway Drive.

1230
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:55.901
Wonderful family lives there,

1231
01:27:56.568 --> 01:27:57.653
little boy,

1232
01:27:58.904 --> 01:27:59.988
single mom.

1233
01:28:01.865 --> 01:28:02.950
Yeah.

1234
01:28:03.659 --> 01:28:05.327
She's a real piece of ass.

1235
01:28:07.621 --> 01:28:09.915
Shit, maybe she'll even stay.

1236
01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:11.500
Shut the fuck up! Fucking...

1237
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.628
Stay the fuck away from my family.

1238
01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:20.300
<i>Joe, the guard
has failed his task.</i>

1239
01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:21.802
Fuck...

1240
01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:24.197
<i>The penalty for which
is immediate termination.</i>

1241
01:28:25.514 --> 01:28:27.194
<i>In exchange for completing
this assignment,</i>

1242
01:28:27.266 --> 01:28:29.685
<i>your termination order will be revoked,</i>

1243
01:28:30.811 --> 01:28:32.291
<i>and you'll be promoted to level nine.</i>

1244
01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:34.666
<i>Then, you will find your purpose.</i>

1245
01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:36.692
Come on, Joe.

1246
01:28:43.323 --> 01:28:44.491
Do it.

1247
01:28:49.746 --> 01:28:50.747
Do it, Joe.

1248
01:28:53.041 --> 01:28:54.126
Do it.

1249
01:28:57.045 --> 01:28:58.255
Do it.

1250
01:28:58.547 --> 01:29:00.007
- Do it, Joe.
<i>- Joe.</i>

1251
01:29:00.674 --> 01:29:01.758
Do it.

1252
01:29:04.428 --> 01:29:05.429
<i>Joe.</i>

1253
01:29:07.055 --> 01:29:08.098
<i>Joe.</i>

1254
01:29:12.978 --> 01:29:14.062
Mm-mm.

1255
01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:17.941
I'm not a monster.

1256
01:29:20.736 --> 01:29:22.029
I'm not a monster.

1257
01:29:24.364 --> 01:29:26.074
I'm not a fuckin' monster!

1258
01:29:27.409 --> 01:29:28.452
You are!

1259
01:29:30.787 --> 01:29:32.206
I'm not a monster!

1260
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.958
And you're not gonna make me one.

1261
01:29:36.084 --> 01:29:37.127
You're all monsters!

1262
01:29:38.253 --> 01:29:39.838
Every last one of y'all!

1263
01:29:41.632 --> 01:29:42.799
You know somethin'?

1264
01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:44.468
I'm glad y'all are here.

1265
01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:47.054
I'm glad you're fuckin' here

1266
01:29:47.262 --> 01:29:49.306
'cause I want you to hear me
and hear me clearly.

1267
01:29:49.389 --> 01:29:53.727
I... fuckin'... quit!

1268
01:30:12.079 --> 01:30:13.455
Hiya, Joe.

1269
01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:18.085
Johnny, your HR partner.

1270
01:30:19.086 --> 01:30:22.589
You've just experienced
our advanced career training simulation.

1271
01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:24.800
It's okay.

1272
01:30:24.925 --> 01:30:26.236
The tech can leave you a little foggy.

1273
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.554
It'll come back. I just came out myself.

1274
01:30:29.054 --> 01:30:30.264
Oh, nice.

1275
01:30:37.896 --> 01:30:39.216
Sorry, I missed lunch.

1276
01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:44.820
What am I thinking? You missed lunch, too.

1277
01:30:44.903 --> 01:30:46.280
You want some of these chips, bro?

1278
01:30:53.078 --> 01:30:56.498
You volunteered for
our lunchtime improvement program.

1279
01:31:00.168 --> 01:31:03.714
You give us 60 minutes,
come back refreshed and ready

1280
01:31:03.797 --> 01:31:06.300
with a new appreciation
for your work at Mallard.

1281
01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:09.302
I know it feels like
you were in there for months.

1282
01:31:09.344 --> 01:31:12.014
Feels that way to me, too, believe me,

1283
01:31:12.097 --> 01:31:13.599
but, uh, it was only an hour.

1284
01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:18.812
It was all manufactured,
the space, the passage of time,

1285
01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:20.439
like a video game.

1286
01:31:21.064 --> 01:31:23.984
For example, your son,
he hasn't even been born yet.

1287
01:31:24.234 --> 01:31:27.112
And obviously, you didn't
smash my face in, right?

1288
01:31:27.905 --> 01:31:30.407
Yes, you were struggling
to break through the ranks

1289
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:32.701
of middle management,
stuck at level eight.

1290
01:31:33.577 --> 01:31:36.747
But watching you in there,
Mallard realized something.

1291
01:31:38.207 --> 01:31:39.726
You weren't struggling
'cause you weren't good enough.

1292
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:43.003
You're too good,
you know. Slow it down.

1293
01:31:43.086 --> 01:31:45.756
No, you just weren't being challenged,

1294
01:31:45.839 --> 01:31:48.842
so... we threw some challenges your way.

1295
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:51.178
And look at this.

1296
01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:53.388
Boom, your productivity spiked.

1297
01:31:53.889 --> 01:31:55.682
Your leadership was off the charts,

1298
01:31:55.766 --> 01:31:59.520
uh, creativity, ingenuity,
that little coup you staged.

1299
01:31:59.603 --> 01:32:00.687
That's big stuff.

1300
01:32:01.104 --> 01:32:02.898
I mean, you showed a willingness to fight.

1301
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:05.192
You're an outside-the-box thinker, Joe.

1302
01:32:06.276 --> 01:32:08.111
Leadership material.

1303
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:11.240
Oh, and I know I said that Mallard

1304
01:32:11.323 --> 01:32:12.908
was watching you the whole time.

1305
01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.284
It's more like,

1306
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:18.163
Mallard was inside your head.

1307
01:32:32.219 --> 01:32:33.804
Oh! Noon o'clock.

1308
01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:36.223
Time to check out your new office.

1309
01:32:36.807 --> 01:32:38.392
Come on, buddy.

1310
01:32:54.408 --> 01:32:56.785
The Mallard corporate ranks
are endless.

1311
01:32:57.536 --> 01:33:00.330
Most days, it feels like
you could keep climbing forever.

1312
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:04.251
Now, this is us, floor 66, management.

1313
01:33:10.382 --> 01:33:12.467
Probably never been this high before, huh?

1314
01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:15.387
It's a lot to take in.

1315
01:33:16.388 --> 01:33:17.389
Yeah.

1316
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.267
Somehow the-the air is,

1317
01:33:20.642 --> 01:33:21.828
I don't know, different up here.

1318
01:33:21.852 --> 01:33:24.104
It's... better, you know?

1319
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:38.619
I know how it feels.

1320
01:33:38.702 --> 01:33:40.454
You give years to Mallard,

1321
01:33:40.954 --> 01:33:43.415
start having dreams at night
you're still at work.

1322
01:33:44.499 --> 01:33:47.419
Stock goes up, company gets bigger,
and you start to wonder,

1323
01:33:47.502 --> 01:33:49.505
"Does anyone here even know I'm alive?"

1324
01:33:49.588 --> 01:33:50.923
Well, I do.

1325
01:33:51.882 --> 01:33:54.676
Mallard does,
and now you're being rewarded.

1326
01:33:57.638 --> 01:33:58.972
Come on, this way.

1327
01:34:14.071 --> 01:34:15.280
Hey, Mallard.

1328
01:34:15.364 --> 01:34:16.883
<i>Yes, Johnny?</i>

1329
01:34:16.907 --> 01:34:18.033
Look who's here.

1330
01:34:18.116 --> 01:34:20.202
<i>Welcome to upper management, Joe.</i>

1331
01:34:20.827 --> 01:34:22.704
<i>We look forward
to your continued improvement.</i>

1332
01:34:23.247 --> 01:34:24.373
<i>Have a great day.</i>

1333
01:34:25.999 --> 01:34:27.501
Isn't she the best?

1334
01:34:37.636 --> 01:34:40.055
<i>You no longer fit
our corporate culture.</i>

1335
01:34:40.138 --> 01:34:41.765
<i>- Good luck, Joe.</i>
- Fuck you!

1336
01:34:45.644 --> 01:34:47.312
Welcome to your new home.

1337
01:34:54.987 --> 01:34:57.155
We found this in your data
and loaded it up.

1338
01:34:57.364 --> 01:34:59.825
Thought we'd make
your home screen feel like home.

1339
01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:01.678
Your tablet is loaded up
with training videos.

1340
01:35:01.702 --> 01:35:04.663
You have till 7:00 p.m.
to watch your quota of 10 videos.

1341
01:35:04.746 --> 01:35:06.790
Cafeteria's open if you need to stay late.

1342
01:35:07.457 --> 01:35:09.251
Mallard makes a hell of a bologna.

1343
01:35:11.461 --> 01:35:13.797
I'll be sending over your perk package,
housing upgrade,

1344
01:35:13.881 --> 01:35:16.508
vehicle upgrade, bonus structure.

1345
01:35:16.884 --> 01:35:18.802
Oh, and one more thing.

1346
01:35:19.678 --> 01:35:21.180
Your standard NDA.

1347
01:35:21.263 --> 01:35:23.807
Discussing the nature
of Mallard's proprietary career training

1348
01:35:23.891 --> 01:35:25.767
will lead to an immediate termination.

1349
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:28.103
Can't tell your coworkers, superiors,

1350
01:35:28.187 --> 01:35:30.480
underlings, mom, wife, priest, nobody.

1351
01:35:30.731 --> 01:35:33.859
We wouldn't wanna undermine
the effectiveness of the simulation.

1352
01:35:33.942 --> 01:35:35.027
Understood?

1353
01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:38.332
What am I saying?
Of course, you understand.

1354
01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:39.948
You're a Mallard man.

1355
01:35:42.576 --> 01:35:43.744
Sign right here.

1356
01:35:56.673 --> 01:35:57.674
Do it, Joe.

1357
01:35:57.758 --> 01:35:58.967
Took everything!

1358
01:36:13.774 --> 01:36:15.234
Congratulations, Joe.

1359
01:36:15.817 --> 01:36:17.819
Mallard truly is your company

1360
01:36:19.112 --> 01:36:20.197
for life.

1361
01:37:37.441 --> 01:37:38.442
Mallard,

1362
01:37:39.735 --> 01:37:41.028
call Kate.

1363
01:37:41.445 --> 01:37:43.113
<i>Calling Kate Stevens.</i>

1364
01:37:47.659 --> 01:37:49.286
<i>A midday call?</i>

1365
01:37:49.536 --> 01:37:50.621
<i>Who died?</i>

1366
01:37:53.457 --> 01:37:54.541
<i>Joe?</i>

1367
01:37:55.292 --> 01:37:56.585
<i>Baby, are you there?</i>

1368
01:37:56.668 --> 01:37:57.669
Um...

1369
01:37:59.379 --> 01:38:00.380
<i>Babe.</i>

1370
01:38:01.548 --> 01:38:02.883
Yeah, I'm here.

1371
01:38:04.218 --> 01:38:05.511
I-I just, um...

1372
01:38:07.054 --> 01:38:09.335
First of all, I just wanted
to hear your voice.

1373
01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:11.475
And, um,

1374
01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:15.103
call you and tell you I love you.

1375
01:38:16.563 --> 01:38:18.190
<i>Ten years you've been at this job,</i>

1376
01:38:18.273 --> 01:38:20.275
<i>and you have never called me during work.</i>

1377
01:38:20.901 --> 01:38:22.236
I just, um...

1378
01:38:23.612 --> 01:38:24.780
I don't know.

1379
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:29.201
I just miss you.

1380
01:38:32.412 --> 01:38:35.415
I've, uh, had a... I've had a very, um,

1381
01:38:39.503 --> 01:38:41.630
long and interesting day.

1382
01:38:43.715 --> 01:38:45.092
<i>Oh, hold on, hold on.</i>

1383
01:38:46.051 --> 01:38:48.136
<i>Oh, my goodness, JJ's kicking.</i>

1384
01:38:49.847 --> 01:38:51.974
<i>He recognizes your voice.</i>

1385
01:38:52.057 --> 01:38:54.101
<i>Oh, that's so sweet.</i>

1386
01:38:58.522 --> 01:39:01.358
Look, um, I'll be home late tonight.

1387
01:39:01.441 --> 01:39:03.193
I'm working a little late, okay?

1388
01:39:03.527 --> 01:39:04.611
<i>Again?</i>

1389
01:39:07.614 --> 01:39:09.157
This time it's-it's...

1390
01:39:11.368 --> 01:39:12.619
This time it's different.

1391
01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:14.246
<i>Joe.</i>

1392
01:39:16.623 --> 01:39:18.834
Can you, can you do me
a favor and-and, um,

1393
01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.755
put the, put the phone to your belly?

1394
01:39:26.758 --> 01:39:28.135
Hey, JJ.

1395
01:39:30.971 --> 01:39:32.347
Can't wait to meet you.

1396
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.269
All right, baby, I'll call you...
I-I'll see you later.

1397
01:39:37.352 --> 01:39:38.770
I-I'll be home later, okay?

1398
01:39:38.854 --> 01:39:40.814
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

1399
01:39:41.023 --> 01:39:42.024
Love you.

1400
01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:12.346
<i>I will be a father to my son.</i>

1401
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:15.599
<i>I will be a father to my son.</i>

1402
01:40:16.225 --> 01:40:18.852
<i>I will be a father to my son.</i>

1403
01:40:21.563 --> 01:40:23.524
<i>Your company for life.</i>

1404
01:40:27.569 --> 01:40:29.071
I'm gonna burn

1405
01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:31.573
this motherfucker down.

1406
01:42:00.162 --> 01:42:02.842
<i>We hope your journey
through tonight's feature presentation</i>

1407
01:42:02.873 --> 01:42:05.334
<i>has been both enjoyable and enlightening.</i>

1408
01:42:05.417 --> 01:42:07.127
<i>We trust you were stirred to evaluate</i>

1409
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:09.087
<i>and conquer your personal quotas</i>

1410
01:42:09.171 --> 01:42:12.341
<i>today, tomorrow and into the future.</i>

1411
01:42:13.258 --> 01:42:16.845
<i>Mallard, your company for life.</i>
