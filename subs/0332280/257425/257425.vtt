1
00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.514
Excuse me.

2
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.144
Come on, honey, let's
get you ready for bed.

3
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.534
I am no one special,

4
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.537
Just a common man
with common thoughts.

5
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.831
I've led a common life.

6
00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:27.749
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

7
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.878
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

8
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.713
But in one respect,

9
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.300
I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

10
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.427
- Looking good, Duke.
- Feeling good.

11
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.220
I've loved another
with all my heart

12
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:44.308
and soul and for me
that has always been enough.

13
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.726
How's it hanging, Harry?

14
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.478
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

15
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.689
Well, you can't
have everything.

16
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:54.943
Big day today.

17
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.821
You say that every day,
you old devil.

18
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:01.033
It's a lovely day
outside.

19
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.285
Let's take a walk.

20
00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:04.411
I don't think so.

21
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.747
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

22
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.373
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air

23
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.959
- would do you good.
- Hello.

24
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.088
I'm sorry,
it's not a good day.

25
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.090
I don't think
she's up for anything.

26
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.425
Hello?

27
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.139
This is Duke,
he's come to read to you.

28
00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.558
- Read?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.521
No.
I don't know.

30
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:34.733
Oh, come on,
you'll like him, he's very funny.

31
00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.788
Ahh...

32
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:53.043
All right now,
where did we leave off?

33
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.421
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it was the night of the carnival.

34
00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.591
"Noah, was there with his friends,
Fin and Sarah."

35
00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:02.803
- Noah?
- That's where they met...

36
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.097
June 6th, 1940.

37
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:08.433
Allie was
17 years old.

38
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.061
- Little man wins a prize.
- Damn!

39
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.313
- Thank you for playing.
- Ha, you're real funny.

40
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.648
Man, I clobbered
that thing.

41
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.650
I'm tellin' you,
these games are fixed.

42
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.318
- Hello.
- How are you?

43
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.279
Hi, what's your name?

44
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.989
Step right up here.

45
00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.366
Over the hook, yeah.

46
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.287
Whoa.

47
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.331
- Who's this girl with Sara?
- Her name's Allie Hamilton.

48
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.834
She's here for the summer
with her family.

49
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.169
Dad's got more
money than God.

50
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.296
- Hi, Fin!
- Hi, honey.

51
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.132
Look, I won you a prize.

52
00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:43.635
Oh, Fin, thank you!

53
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.890
- Oww!
- Yeah.

54
00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.683
Hey great, huh?

55
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.560
Hey Allie, you want
some cotton candy?

56
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.770
- Umm, okay.
- That would be so much fun.

57
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.066
You only get
one chance, son.

58
00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.485
- You want to dance with me?
- No.

59
00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.655
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

60
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:06.700
Noah, she's with us.

61
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:10.621
Hey Allie, you want
to ride the Ferris wheel?

62
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.206
- I'd love to.
- All right.

63
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.999
Excuse me.

64
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.835
Excuse me.

65
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.675
- Noah Calhoun.
- What?

66
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.470
Works down at the 
lumber yard with Fin.

67
00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:28.680
Oh...

68
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.683
Did you see he was standing like
two inches away from my face?

69
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.977
Yeah, I saw.
That's Noah, though.

70
00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:37.105
You know I'm surprised
he even came over.

71
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.607
I think he likes you.

72
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.295
Hey what... jerk...

73
00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.715
Get off me.
Don't touch me.

74
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.801
- Hey!
- Well, I... ugh!

75
00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:07.845
- What are you doing?
- Hey, you can't do that!

76
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.596
I'll pay you
when I get down, Tommy.

77
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.431
I'm Noah Calhoun.

78
00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.559
- So?!
- So, it's really nice to meet you.

79
00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.144
- Allie, who is this guy?
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun.

80
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.772
- I would really like to take you out.
- Friend! Do you mind?

81
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:23.277
You can't sit more than two people
in a chair, Noah.

82
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.903
Okay, Tommy,
all right.

83
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.409
Get down, Noah,
you're gonna kill yourself!

84
00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:31.618
Noah, cut it out.

85
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.328
Now, will you
go out with me?

86
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.038
What?

87
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.500
- No.
- No?

88
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.085
Hey pal,
she just told you.

89
00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:41.211
Why not?

90
00:07:41.378 --> 00:07:43.255
I don't know,
because I don't want to.

91
00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:44.298
Noah!

92
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.800
What? Well, you leave me
no other choice then.

93
00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:48.927
Oh my God.

94
00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:49.970
I'm not kidding.

95
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.722
- Noah, stop fooling around.
- What are you doing?

96
00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:54.141
- Noah, grab the bar.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

97
00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:55.809
Will you...

98
00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.562
- or will you not go out with me?
- Noah, you best come on.

99
00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.481
- God damn, my hand's slipping.
- Then grab the bar, you idiot.

100
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.276
- Not until she agrees.
- Ah, go on out with him, honey.

101
00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:06.486
Okay, okay, fine,
I'll go out with you.

102
00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:07.821
- What?
- No, don't do me any favors.

103
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:09.156
No, no. I want to.

104
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.532
- You want to? You want to?
- Yes!

105
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.534
- Say it.
- I want to go out with you.

106
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.162
- Say it again.
- I want to go out with you.

107
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.539
All right, all right
we'll go out.

108
00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.334
You think you're so smart, 
don't you?

109
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.044
That wasn't funny,
Noah, you idiot!

110
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:25.506
No, it's okay,
I'll take care of this.

111
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.257
What are you doing?

112
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:28.300
Please don't do that.

113
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:29.843
Please don't do that, Allie.

114
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.637
I can't believe...

115
00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.430
Oh God.

116
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.892
You're not so cocky now,
are ya?

117
00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.810
I'm gonna get you for that.

118
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:41.355
Ah, maybe you will,
maybe you won't.

119
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:47.110
- Did he say anything to you?
- Oh, yeah, will you look at that?

120
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.196
It's that girl from 
the Carnival, right?

121
00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.534
Do you remember me?

122
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.078
Yeah, sure,
Mr. Underwear, was it?

123
00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.871
- Well, I...
- How could I forget.

124
00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.373
Yeah, I wanted to clear
that up with you,

125
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.916
because I'm really 
sorry about that.

126
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.251
It was a really 
stupid thing to do...

127
00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:03.877
crawl up a Ferris wheel
to talk to somebody.

128
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.838
But I had
to be next to you.

129
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.173
I was being
drawn to you.

130
00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.512
Oh... oh, jeez,
what a line!

131
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.889
You use that
on all the girls?

132
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.683
- No.
- Right.

133
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.018
I saw you the other night
with little Miss Ribbons.

134
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.728
- What are you doing tonight?
- What?

135
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.772
Or tomorrow night,
or this weekend, whatever.

136
00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:25.732
- Why?
- Why? Our date.

137
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.067
What date?

138
00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:28.819
- The date that you agreed to.
- No...

139
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:31.071
Yes, you did.
You promised and you swore it.

140
00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.990
Well, I guess
I changed my mind.

141
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.827
Look, I know you get some dirty guy
coming up to you

142
00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:38.412
on the street...
you don't know him.

143
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.372
You don't know me,
but I know me.

144
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.667
And when I see something
that I like,

145
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.044
I gotta ha...
I love it.

146
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.130
I go... I mean,
I go crazy for it.

147
00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:50.924
Okay, what are you
talking about?

148
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.301
Well, you.

149
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.053
Oh, you're good.

150
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.722
- What?
- You're good.

151
00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.224
- No. No, you're getting me wrong.
- You're good. You are.

152
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:00.767
- You're fantastic.
- I'm not.

153
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.686
You really are.
I'm impressed.

154
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:06.023
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yes, you are.

155
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.150
I can be fun,
if you want...

156
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:11.695
pensive, uh, smart,

157
00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:14.448
uh, superstitious,
brave.

158
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:17.451
And uh... I can be light on my feet.

159
00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:20.037
I could be
whatever you want.

160
00:10:20.204 --> 00:10:22.915
You just tell me what you want
and I'll be that for you.

161
00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.501
You're dumb.

162
00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.129
I could be that.

163
00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:33.926
Come on, one date.
What's it gonna hurt?

164
00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.636
Umm...
I don't think so.

165
00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.471
Well, what I can I do
to change your mind?

166
00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:39.598
Guess you'll figure
something out.

167
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.936
- You sure she's coming?
- Relax, pal, it's all set up.

168
00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.479
We're meeting her
for the late show.

169
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.481
Look... what did
I tell you? Come on.

170
00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:56.448
Oh my goodness,
what a coincidence!

171
00:10:56.615 --> 00:10:58.200
I need to talk to you
for a second.

172
00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:01.995
- He's here!
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?

173
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.038
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.998
- Come here.
- Fin!

175
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.086
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

177
00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:11.296
- You look great.
- Aw, thanks.

178
00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:13.006
Really, really great.

179
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.758
You do look great.
You look great.

180
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:18.178
And I know I look great,
so could we please go see this movie?

181
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.014
- The show's about to start.
- After you.

182
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.684
You come back here,
Li'I Abner.

183
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.270
You ain't gonna catch me,
Daisy Mae!

184
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.564
It's Sadie Hawkins Day,
I'm supposed to catch you!

185
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.482
I'm faster than you.

186
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:34.111
No, No!

187
00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:36.488
I'll get you!

188
00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:39.449
I'm going get...

189
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.951
Here I come!

190
00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:43.620
You better run fast!

191
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.215
You ketchum Polecat
far and squar.

192
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.057
Wait for me.

193
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.226
What happened
in that movie?

194
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.730
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

195
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.233
- What are you guys doing?
- Want to walk with me?

196
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.234
Yeah, what's going on?

197
00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.736
- Yeah.
- We're gonna walk.

198
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:18.238
Do you guys
love each other?

199
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.574
Huh?
Oh, I get it.

200
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.410
- You guys do love each other.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

201
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:24.578
Okay, good bye.

202
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:27.206
- All right, all right.
- Mmm...

203
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:33.253
That was fun.

204
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.130
Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:37.591
I haven't seen a movie
in ages.

206
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:39.384
- Really?
- Huh-uh.

207
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.221
Not since
I was a little kid.

208
00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.847
What?

209
00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.682
No, I, uh...

210
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.435
I'm busy, you know,
I don't have a lot of time.

211
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.063
- You're busy?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.691
I have a very
strict schedule.

213
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.485
My days are all
planned out.

214
00:12:56.652 --> 00:13:00.781
I get up in the morning... breakfast,
math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch,

215
00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:04.535
tennis lessons, dance lessons...
sometimes both...

216
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.413
French tutor, piano lesson,
then I eat dinner.

217
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.457
And after dinner
I spend time with my family.

218
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.418
And then I... I catch up
on some reading.

219
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.923
Wow.

220
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:20.759
Sounds like the road
to success.

221
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:22.469
Oh, you bet.

222
00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.137
We're applying
to all these colleges...

223
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:28.767
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence...
those are the ones we want.

224
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.230
- And who's we?
- What?

225
00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:35.357
You just said,
"The ones that we want."

226
00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:37.067
Oh, Mom and Daddy.

227
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:39.027
We decide
everything together.

228
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:42.489
Everything?

229
00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:44.157
No, not everything.

230
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.076
But the important
things, yes.

231
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.914
And then everything else,
you get to decide all by yourself?

232
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.627
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.

233
00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:01.133
Just trying to figure out
what you do for fun.

234
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.011
What do you mean?

235
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.430
I mean...

236
00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:08.056
I don't know,
I mean all those things

237
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.684
are things you
have to do, right?

238
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:14.563
So what do you do
because you want to?

239
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.857
I just told ya.

240
00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.486
I don't know.

241
00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:24.031
This surprises me.

242
00:14:24.198 --> 00:14:25.365
Why?

243
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.869
I just always figured
you were kinda...

244
00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.704
Kinda what?

245
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.164
Just...

246
00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:36.877
- Free.
- What?

247
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:38.587
Free.

248
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.258
I am free.

249
00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:46.053
You don't seem like it.

250
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.222
Well, I am.

251
00:14:50.349 --> 00:14:52.226
Come here, I want to 
show you something.

252
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.896
- Noah, what are you doing?
- Just come on.

253
00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:59.525
- You're gonna get run over.
- By all the cars?

254
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.742
My Dad and I used
to come out here

255
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.538
and lay down and watch
the lights change.

256
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.707
And watch them go
from green to red to yellow.

257
00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.962
You could try it,
if you wanted to.

258
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.422
- No.
- Why not?

259
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.217
Because I don't know...
will you just get up?

260
00:15:25.384 --> 00:15:27.761
That's your problem,
you know that?

261
00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:30.639
You don't do
what you want.

262
00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.566
Okay.

263
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.626
What happens
if a car comes?

264
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.378
- We die.
- What?

265
00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:03.338
Just relax.
Just trust.

266
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.966
You need to learn
how to trust.

267
00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.136
Okay.

268
00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:13.807
- Painting.
- Hmm?

269
00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.393
You asked me
what I do for me.

270
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.147
- What now?
- I love to paint.

271
00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:23.400
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.485
Huh.

273
00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:29.489
Most of the time, I have all these
thoughts bouncing around in my head.

274
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.826
But with a brush
in my hand,

275
00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:35.746
the world just gets
kinda quiet.

276
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.464
Get out of the street!

277
00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:55.349
Are you okay?

278
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.145
Why are you laughing?

279
00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:05.901
Oh, that was fun.

280
00:17:10.322 --> 00:17:11.990
Do you want
to dance with me?

281
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.743
Sure.

282
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.164
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:20.833
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.460
Not supposed to dance
in the middle of the street.

285
00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:26.588
Who said dance
in the street?

286
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.257
And we don't
have any music.

287
00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.884
Well,
we'll make some.

288
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.145
Bum bum

289
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.856
Bum bum bum

290
00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.732

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.901

Bum bum bum
bum bum.

293
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.030
You're a terrible singer.

294
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.782
I know.

295
00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.077

- Armed with warnings and doubts,

308
00:18:56.678 --> 00:19:01.141
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably
convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl

309
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:03.894
traveling down
a very long road

310
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:06.146
with no regard
for the consequences.

311
00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:07.856
They fell in love,
didn't they?

312
00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:09.942
- Yes, they did.
- Good.

313
00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.778
I like this kind
of story. Go on.

314
00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:19.576
After that night,

315
00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:22.830
Allie and Noah spent
every waking hour together.

316
00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.541
And soon they 
were inseparable.

317
00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.585
- Noah, come on.
- Your boat cannot beat me there.

318
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.931
- That's really nice.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm...

319
00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:52.818
"Beautiful dripping fragments.

320
00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:54.528
The negligent list

321
00:19:54.695 --> 00:19:56.780
of one after another,

322
00:19:56.947 --> 00:19:59.199
as I happen to call
them to me.

323
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.076
Or drink to them.

324
00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:03.203
The real poems,
what we call poems,

325
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.582
being merely pictures.
The poems of the privacy of the night.

326
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:09.585
And of men like me.

327
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.879
This poem,
drooping shy and unseen,

328
00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.090
that I always carry.
And that all men carry. "

329
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:17.384
Not bad for Whitman.

330
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.053
Hey, look,
we got a visitor.

331
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.931
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

332
00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.893
Well, don't apologize,
come on up here, darling.

333
00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:29.271
We could use a little something here
besides the smell of lumber.

334
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.316
Dad,
this is Allison Hamilton.

335
00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.901
Allison,
I'm glad to meet you.

336
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:35.110
- Allie.
- Allie.

337
00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:36.570
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Calhoun.

338
00:20:36.737 --> 00:20:38.864
Well Mr. Calho...
What, am I old or something?

339
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:40.490
You can call me Frank.

340
00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:42.701
- Here, come in and have a seat.
- Okay.

341
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:46.330
So, Allie.
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.

342
00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:49.082
- Yes.
- She's a lot prettier than you let on.

343
00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:51.084
- Oh, is that right?
- No, it's not right.

344
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.336
Don't believe what he says.

345
00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.963
- What is this you got?
- Umm, I... uh, I just...

346
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.298
I brought you something.

347
00:20:56.465 --> 00:20:59.426
Let me see.
Let's have a look.

348
00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.470
- Did you do this?
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:03.305
Well, that's beautiful.
Look at that.

350
00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:05.140
That's a damn picture there.

351
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.269
Well, I know just where we can
put that, thank you.

352
00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:11.897
Oh, that was
a lovely poem.

353
00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:13.482
What was it?

354
00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:15.108
- EI...
- Whitman.

355
00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:18.695
See when he was a little kid
he used to stutter real bad.

356
00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.281
- Dad...
- So... well, you did.

357
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.408
- I didn't know that.
- God. I stammered.

358
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:24.868
Stammered, stutter,
what's the difference?

359
00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.663
Couldn't understand
a damn thing he said.

360
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.999
So, I got him to read me poetry
out loud.

361
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.501
It wasn't
very pretty at first,

362
00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:33.794
but then his stutter
went away.

363
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:35.754
Well, it's a good idea,
that poetry.

364
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:37.297
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Huh?

365
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.133
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

366
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.636
I'm a Tennyson man,
myself, but he likes Whitman...

367
00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:44.513
For some reason,
I don't know.

368
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.099
Say, how would you like some breakfast?
Would you like some breakfast?

369
00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:48.642
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

370
00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.061
- Dad, it's 10:00.
- What's that got to do with it?

371
00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:53.397
You can have pancakes
any damn time of night you want.

372
00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:56.483
- Come on, you want some breakfast?
- Sure.

373
00:21:57.818 --> 00:22:00.821
It was an improbable romance.

374
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:04.700
He was a country boy.
She was from the city.

375
00:22:04.867 --> 00:22:06.493
She had the world
at her feet,

376
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.829
while he didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

377
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.210
Noah, come on.

378
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:17.379
Whoo!

379
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.631
Look at us.

380
00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:23.385
What are we doing?

381
00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:26.430
Do you think in another life,
I could have been a bird?

382
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:29.516
What do you mean?

383
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.810
Like reincarnation.

384
00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:34.563
I don't know.

385
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.315
I think I could.

386
00:22:42.696 --> 00:22:43.947
Say I'm a bird.

387
00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:46.492
No.

388
00:22:46.658 --> 00:22:48.535
- Don't do it.
- Say I'm a bird.

389
00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:50.537
Stop it. Stop it now.

390
00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:52.498
- You're not.
- Say it!

391
00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:57.002
- You're a bird.
- Yeah.

392
00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:04.551
Now say
you're a bird too.

393
00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:09.473
If you're a bird,
I'm a bird.

394
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.050
- Come on, darling.
- What are you doing?

395
00:23:45.217 --> 00:23:46.885
Don't.
Don't!

396
00:23:56.937 --> 00:23:58.438
Here we go,
on the count of three, okay?

397
00:23:58.605 --> 00:24:00.983
Real easy,
on three, ready?

398
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:02.609
- Okay, okay.
- One...

399
00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.903
- Two... two...
- two...

400
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.488
...three!
- No! I can't.

401
00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:08.740
Get in the water!

402
00:24:08.907 --> 00:24:10.951
- Get in! I'm sorry.
- Come on, chicken.

403
00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:12.911
Get in the water, baby.
Baby, would you get in.

404
00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:14.955
- Get in the water.
- I can't.

405
00:24:15.122 --> 00:24:16.456
- Go!
- Get in the water!

406
00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:17.791
- One...
- Come on, jump.

407
00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:20.002
- Two...
- Three.

408
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:33.098
Keep 'em together!
No, no, no.

409
00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:35.017
- Get to your place.
- Down here.

410
00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:37.519
And move.
And keep it.

411
00:24:37.686 --> 00:24:38.562
No, don't move it!

412
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:40.480
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

413
00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:42.983
They didn't agree on much.

414
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.819
In fact, they rarely agreed on
everything. They fought all the time.

415
00:24:45.986 --> 00:24:47.446
- Don't kick me!
- Don't push me.

416
00:24:47.613 --> 00:24:49.865
And they challenged
each other every day.

417
00:24:50.032 --> 00:24:51.992
But despite
their differences,

418
00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:54.953
they had one
important thing in common.

419
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.748
They were crazy
about each other.

420
00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:01.001
Okay,
I have to go.

421
00:25:01.168 --> 00:25:03.253
- No.
- Yes, I do.

422
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:18.185
Allie.

423
00:25:18.352 --> 00:25:21.522
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy you're...

424
00:25:21.688 --> 00:25:22.689
I didn't see you there.

425
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:25.651
You kinda scared me.

426
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:30.989
Becoming friendly
with that boy down there.

427
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.827
Yes.

428
00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:37.579
Bring him
to the house on Sunday.

429
00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:39.581
I want to meet
this young man.

430
00:25:39.748 --> 00:25:42.376
Okay.

431
00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:43.585
Good night, Daddy.

432
00:25:43.752 --> 00:25:45.754
Good night.

433
00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:53.595
Oh, boy.

434
00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:55.389
This bug goes
"Daddy, I don't understand."

435
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:59.893
He goes, "Well, in theory,
we're both millionaires, but in reality,

436
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.562
we live with
a bunch of whores. "

437
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:07.484
Bishop Stevens
told me that.

438
00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:11.113
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor
decanter from in front of my husband.

439
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.573
I think he's had
a little too much to drink.

440
00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:15.242
- I don't get it.
- Pay attention.

441
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:17.870
So, what do
you do, Noah?

442
00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:20.747
I work at the lumber yard
with Fin.

443
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:24.918
Mainly milling and receiving logs...
and stripping the bark.

444
00:26:25.085 --> 00:26:26.461
Oh, that's lovely, dear.

445
00:26:26.628 --> 00:26:28.213
Thank you.

446
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.757
If you don't mind my asking, uh,
how much do you make at your job?

447
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.593
Uh, how much money
do I make?

448
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.553
Mm-hmm.

449
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.264
About 40 cents an hour.

450
00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:42.769
Yeah, it's not much,
but I don't need a lot.

451
00:26:42.936 --> 00:26:45.063
And I...
I save most of it.

452
00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:48.275
Let's eat. Shall we?

453
00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:51.570
Yes! Oh,
it looks delicious.

454
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:57.284
So Noah, you and Allie have been
spending a lot of time together.

455
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:01.371
You must be very fond
of each other.

456
00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:05.417
It's getting
pretty serious, huh?

457
00:27:05.584 --> 00:27:07.169
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:11.465
Well, summer's almost gone.
What will you do?

459
00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:14.259
You know, Charleston's
only a couple of hours away.

460
00:27:16.428 --> 00:27:18.388
But Allie's going
to Sarah Lawrence.

461
00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.767
Didn't she tell you?

462
00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:24.061
No, she didn't
tell me that.

463
00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:28.482
I just got the letter.
I was going to tell you.

464
00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:29.691
It's okay.

465
00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:32.903
And Sarah Lawrence
is in New York.

466
00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:38.617
I didn't know that.

467
00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:43.288
Anne, this conversation's
too stuffy for the dinner table.

468
00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:46.667
Let the children have fun without
bringing in the Spanish Inquisition.

469
00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:48.836
My lips are buttoned,
right now.

470
00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:52.548
I do know another joke about the Nun
and the full standing bishop.

471
00:27:53.882 --> 00:27:54.758
- Stop
- That wasn't me.

472
00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:57.052
I'm leaving the table
if you tell another joke.

473
00:27:59.721 --> 00:28:00.973
Whoo!

474
00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:02.266
I'm gonna do it.

475
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.434
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

476
00:28:10.148 --> 00:28:13.235
That child's got too much spirit for
a girl of her circumstance.

477
00:28:13.402 --> 00:28:16.321
Nah, it's just
summer love.

478
00:28:16.488 --> 00:28:18.073
Trouble
is what it is.

479
00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:29.001
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

480
00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:44.725
Is that Allie
out there?

481
00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:49.229
Do you want
to go somewhere?

482
00:28:51.565 --> 00:28:52.566
Okay.

483
00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.323
Wait here.

484
00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:21.345
Allie!

485
00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:24.515
Come on.

486
00:29:28.727 --> 00:29:30.437
All right,
take a step.

487
00:29:30.604 --> 00:29:33.023
Step. No, don't...

488
00:29:34.608 --> 00:29:36.235
All right,
just stay there.

489
00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:38.570
Don't open
your eyes.

490
00:29:45.285 --> 00:29:46.995
Okay.

491
00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:49.289
The Windsor Plantation.

492
00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:51.834
It was built in 1772.

493
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.169
- Rumor has it that Francis Marion...
- Mm-hmm?

494
00:29:54.336 --> 00:29:57.464
Proposed to his wife right here under
these... uh, these steps.

495
00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:00.008
- Huh?
- Watch out.

496
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:02.135
You be careful, these are broken.
Look at that.

497
00:30:02.302 --> 00:30:04.137
This...

498
00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:05.931
This place is gigantic.

499
00:30:06.098 --> 00:30:08.141
Yeah, a gigantic
piece of crap.

500
00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:10.644
It is.

501
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:13.814
But I'm gonna buy it one day
and I'm gonna fix it up.

502
00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:15.774
All it needs
is a new floor.

503
00:30:16.942 --> 00:30:18.527
And new walls
and a roof.

504
00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:21.655
- Is that all?
- And plumbing and electric.

505
00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:24.158
- And furniture.
- Yes, and furniture.

506
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:25.784
But it's right
on the water.

507
00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:27.619
And there's a big
old barn out there...

508
00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:29.830
I could turn that
into my workshop.

509
00:30:29.997 --> 00:30:31.957
Well, what about me?

510
00:30:32.124 --> 00:30:33.584
Now don't I get
any say in this?

511
00:30:35.961 --> 00:30:37.546
You want a say in this?

512
00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:40.382
Yes, I would.

513
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:41.758
What do you want?

514
00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:43.051
I want
a white house...

515
00:30:43.218 --> 00:30:45.762
- with blue shutters...
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:48.599
And a room overlooking
the river so I can paint.

517
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:51.018
- Anything else?
- Yes.

518
00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:54.938
I want a big old porch that
wraps around the entire house.

519
00:30:55.105 --> 00:30:56.690
- We can drink tea...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

520
00:30:56.857 --> 00:30:58.567
and watch
the sun go down.

521
00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:02.571
- Okay.
- You promise?

522
00:31:02.738 --> 00:31:05.073
Mm-hmm,
I promise.

523
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.575
Good.

524
00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:10.370
- Where are you going?
- In here.

525
00:31:13.874 --> 00:31:15.417
Wow.

526
00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:03.799
I can't play chopsticks
if you're doing that.

527
00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:24.945
Oh, God.

528
00:32:25.112 --> 00:32:27.030
Oh, make love to me.

529
00:34:21.728 --> 00:34:22.729
- Noah.
- Yeah?

530
00:34:22.896 --> 00:34:25.357
Um...

531
00:34:25.524 --> 00:34:27.734
I know I said that I wanted you
to make love to me,

532
00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:28.986
- but I think you...
- Yeah?

533
00:34:29.153 --> 00:34:31.363
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

534
00:34:33.574 --> 00:34:35.951
- Right. You all right?
- Yeah.

535
00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:37.744
- Did I hurt you?
- No, no.

536
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.581
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of thoughts.

537
00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:43.917
I'm just...
I'm just having a lot of...

538
00:34:44.084 --> 00:34:45.210
never mind.

539
00:34:51.633 --> 00:34:54.469
Like what are you thinking?
What are you thinking, right now?

540
00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:56.471
You know,
right this second?

541
00:34:57.472 --> 00:34:58.432
Uh.

542
00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:01.977
Did you know that this was going
to happen when you brought me here?

543
00:35:02.144 --> 00:35:03.270
- No.
- No?

544
00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:06.773
- No.
- No, you didn't think about it?

545
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.109
- Of course I thought about it.
- You did?

546
00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:11.862
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what did you think?

547
00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:14.031
Uh, I'm talking
too much, aren't I?

548
00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:16.783
Okay, okay,
I'm just going to shut up.

549
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.327
Mum's the word.

550
00:35:18.494 --> 00:35:20.787
Okay.

551
00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:23.790
- You all right?
- Yeah.

552
00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:26.251
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

553
00:35:26.418 --> 00:35:29.880
I just don't understand
how come you're so quiet.

554
00:35:30.047 --> 00:35:32.466
You don't have
one thought?

555
00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:33.926
I'm going crazy
over here,

556
00:35:34.092 --> 00:35:36.345
but no, with you,
everything's fine.

557
00:35:36.512 --> 00:35:38.430
You don't have
a care in the world?

558
00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:48.148
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:50.901
I wanted this
to be so perfect.

560
00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:53.195
Now I can't shut up.

561
00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.491
I love you.

562
00:35:59.868 --> 00:36:01.537
Did you know that?

563
00:36:16.343 --> 00:36:17.845
I love you too.

564
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:27.521
Yeah.

565
00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:37.197
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

566
00:36:37.364 --> 00:36:40.701
No, no, I want to,
I do.

567
00:36:41.743 --> 00:36:43.537
Noah!
Noah!

568
00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:46.206
What? Fin,
get out of here!

569
00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.667
Look, I'm sorry,
but Allie's parents are going crazy.

570
00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:50.711
They got every cop in town
out looking for her.

571
00:37:03.807 --> 00:37:06.226
- You sent the police for me?
- Yes.

572
00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:08.520
It is two in the morning.
We sent the police.

573
00:37:08.687 --> 00:37:11.732
Thank God you're all right.
Where you been?

574
00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:13.817
Mr. Hamilton,
all this is my fault.

575
00:37:13.984 --> 00:37:15.777
Would you give us
a moment please?

576
00:37:15.944 --> 00:37:18.739
I'd like to talk
to my daughter.

577
00:37:18.906 --> 00:37:20.657
Alone, young lady.

578
00:37:27.247 --> 00:37:29.458
Thanks for everything,
Lieutenant.

579
00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:31.585
You bet, John, anytime.

580
00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:34.254
You go straight home now,
it's late.

581
00:37:40.886 --> 00:37:42.387
Sir, it's really
not her fault.

582
00:37:42.554 --> 00:37:44.848
I lost track
of time.

583
00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:48.185
Sit down.

584
00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.404
I'm sorry, Daddy.

585
00:38:03.325 --> 00:38:06.245
- Is he a rapist?
- No.

586
00:38:11.667 --> 00:38:15.796
- Like what, mother?
- You are going to stop seeing Noah.

587
00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:18.590
She is out fooling around
with that boy till 2:00 in the morning

588
00:38:18.757 --> 00:38:20.926
and it has got
to stop.

589
00:38:21.093 --> 00:38:22.719
I didn't spend
17 years of my life

590
00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:26.014
raising a daughter
and giving her everything...

591
00:38:26.181 --> 00:38:27.891
so she could throw it away
on a summer romance.

592
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:28.934
Daddy, come on!

593
00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:30.936
She will wind up with her
heart broken or pregnant.

594
00:38:31.103 --> 00:38:32.646
- Anne, please.
- Now, he is a nice boy.

595
00:38:32.813 --> 00:38:36.650
- He's a nice boy, but he's...
- He's what? He's what? Tell me.

596
00:38:36.817 --> 00:38:38.861
He is trash, trash, trash...
not for you.

597
00:38:39.027 --> 00:38:41.238
Trash?

598
00:38:50.664 --> 00:38:52.291
Don't touch me!

599
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:56.628
Now that is enough. You are not to see
him anymore. And that's final.

600
00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:58.130
- No, it's not final.
- Yes it is.

601
00:38:58.297 --> 00:38:59.673
- No, it's not final!
- Allie!

602
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.092
You're not going to tell me
who I'm gonna love.

603
00:39:02.259 --> 00:39:05.804
- Love?
- Yes Daddy, I love him.

604
00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:08.515
I love him.

605
00:39:08.682 --> 00:39:10.684
He's not suitable
for you, baby.

606
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.199
I love him.

607
00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:27.701
You are 17 years old,
you don't know anything about love.

608
00:39:27.868 --> 00:39:29.703
Oh, and you do?

609
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.997
You don't look at Daddy
the way I look at Noah.

610
00:39:32.164 --> 00:39:33.916
You don't touch
or laugh.

611
00:39:34.082 --> 00:39:37.252
You don't play.
You don't know anything about love.

612
00:39:38.253 --> 00:39:41.715
Noah?

613
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:46.220
Hey, hey.

614
00:39:46.386 --> 00:39:48.055
You leaving?

615
00:39:50.307 --> 00:39:53.018
Oh my God,
I'm so sorry.

616
00:39:53.185 --> 00:39:56.563
I don't even know what to say.
I'm humiliated.

617
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.649
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

618
00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:00.776
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

619
00:40:00.943 --> 00:40:02.528
Shh...

620
00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:10.661
No.

621
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.418
- I'm gonna go.
- No, I don't want you to go.

622
00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:20.629
I got to think
about some stuff.

623
00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:23.173
What do you
got to think about, huh?

624
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.092
Come here
and talk to me.

625
00:40:25.259 --> 00:40:26.718
Talk to me!

626
00:40:26.885 --> 00:40:28.720
About what?
You want...

627
00:40:28.887 --> 00:40:30.639
you're going away!

628
00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:34.309
You're leaving.

629
00:40:34.476 --> 00:40:36.979
And I'm staying here.

630
00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:39.690
And I'm so happy
that you're doing it,

631
00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:42.109
but you're gonna have
a million things to do.

632
00:40:42.276 --> 00:40:43.861
- No.
- You got so much ahead of you.

633
00:40:44.027 --> 00:40:45.821
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

634
00:40:45.988 --> 00:40:49.700
I'm not going to have
nice things, fancy things.

635
00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:52.244
It doesn't...

636
00:40:52.411 --> 00:40:54.788
It's never gonna happen for me.
It's not in the cards for me.

637
00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:56.665
I don't have
to go to school, okay?

638
00:40:56.832 --> 00:40:58.333
- Yes, you do.
- I can stay here.

639
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.836
No. Do you see, that's exactly
what I am talking about.

640
00:41:01.003 --> 00:41:02.337
Then you can
come with me.

641
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.799
- To New York?
- Yes.

642
00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:09.428
What am I going
to do in New York?

643
00:41:11.972 --> 00:41:13.432
Be with me?

644
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.230
Yeah.

645
00:41:22.983 --> 00:41:24.610
I don't know.

646
00:41:29.448 --> 00:41:31.867
We don't got to figure all this
out tonight, ya know?

647
00:41:32.034 --> 00:41:34.578
We'll finish out the summer and we'll
see what happens.

648
00:41:35.954 --> 00:41:37.664
You saying you want
to break it off?

649
00:41:37.831 --> 00:41:40.667
What I'm saying we see how it goes
later on.

650
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.593
Are you breaking up
with me?

651
00:41:52.262 --> 00:41:54.181
I don't see
how it's gonna work.

652
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.143
I see...

653
00:41:59.728 --> 00:42:01.980
Please don't do this.

654
00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:03.607
You don't mean it.

655
00:42:04.942 --> 00:42:07.110
Oh hell, well if you're
going to do it,

656
00:42:07.277 --> 00:42:09.196
why wait until
the summer ends, huh?

657
00:42:09.363 --> 00:42:11.448
Why don't you
just do it, right now?

658
00:42:11.615 --> 00:42:13.200
Huh?

659
00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:14.493
Come on.

660
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.869
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

661
00:42:16.036 --> 00:42:17.955
Do it!
Do it!

662
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:19.665
Do it right now.

663
00:42:19.832 --> 00:42:22.417
Do it!

664
00:42:22.584 --> 00:42:23.585
Stop it!

665
00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:24.878
Oh!

666
00:42:25.045 --> 00:42:27.589
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
It's over.

667
00:42:27.756 --> 00:42:29.591
Okay? It's over.

668
00:42:29.758 --> 00:42:32.135
- Come here.
- Don't touch me.

669
00:42:32.302 --> 00:42:34.179
I hate you,
I hate you.

670
00:42:34.346 --> 00:42:35.472
I'm gonna go.

671
00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:38.016
Why don't you, why don't you
just go. Get out.

672
00:42:38.183 --> 00:42:41.854
Leave!
Go! Go!

673
00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:46.233
No, no, just wait a minute. We're not
really breaking up, are we?

674
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.359
Come on.

675
00:42:47.526 --> 00:42:48.902
This is just a fight
we're having,

676
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:52.156
and tomorrow it will be
like it never happened, right?

677
00:42:57.744 --> 00:43:00.205
- Going?
- Gone.

678
00:43:00.372 --> 00:43:02.040
Well, she must have
been devastated.

679
00:43:02.207 --> 00:43:03.417
She was.

680
00:43:03.584 --> 00:43:05.294
He was only trying
to do the right thing.

681
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.837
Yeah.

682
00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:08.672
But what he really should have done

683
00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:10.507
is just told those parents
to go to hell.

684
00:43:10.674 --> 00:43:12.384
Just stick it
where the sun don't shine.

685
00:43:12.551 --> 00:43:15.637
Yeah, you're right,
probably should have.

686
00:43:17.264 --> 00:43:19.433
The next day,
Allie woke up

687
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.144
to find her world
completely changed.

688
00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:31.320
What's going on?

689
00:43:31.487 --> 00:43:33.238
We're going home.

690
00:43:34.364 --> 00:43:35.741
- We're going now?
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:43:35.908 --> 00:43:38.243
No, we're not supposed to be leaving
for another week.

692
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.954
Get dressed and then come and have
some breakfast, dear.

693
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:42.498
Willow will pack
your things.

694
00:43:42.664 --> 00:43:44.625
Why, I'd be happy to pack your things,
Miss Allie.

695
00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:45.959
I don't want
you to pack my things.

696
00:43:46.126 --> 00:43:48.128
I don't want you to touch my stuff.
I'm not going.

697
00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:49.630
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

698
00:43:49.796 --> 00:43:51.798
- Yes, Allie, you are.
- No, I'm not.

699
00:43:51.965 --> 00:43:54.510
Allie, you are going whether
you like it or not.

700
00:43:54.676 --> 00:43:57.304
Now, even if Aaron
has to throw you over his shoulder

701
00:43:57.471 --> 00:44:01.183
and drag you the whole way,
you're going.

702
00:44:05.479 --> 00:44:06.480
Excuse me.

703
00:44:06.647 --> 00:44:07.814
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

704
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:09.525
We have to have all these
done by lunch.

705
00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:10.567
Come on, get on!

706
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.194
You shouldn't be standing around.
Here we go.

707
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:13.237
Let's go.
Come on.

708
00:44:13.403 --> 00:44:15.322
Fin!

709
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:20.911
Where's Noah?

710
00:44:21.078 --> 00:44:22.663
He's out
delivering a load.

711
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:26.500
- What's going on?
- I'm leaving town.

712
00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:28.085
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

713
00:44:28.252 --> 00:44:30.754
- When?
- Now, right now... like today.

714
00:44:32.923 --> 00:44:34.716
Look, I need you to tell Noah
something, okay?

715
00:44:34.883 --> 00:44:36.510
I need you
to tell him that I love him.

716
00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:39.179
And tell him
that I'm sorry for everything, okay?

717
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:43.684
Look, I was up all night
with him, Allie.

718
00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:45.269
I've never seen him
so low.

719
00:44:45.435 --> 00:44:48.522
It's over. Don't make it any harder
than it already is.

720
00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:50.399
No! No, it's not over.

721
00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:52.234
Fin, we had a fight
last night.

722
00:44:52.401 --> 00:44:54.862
No, we said some things we didn't mean,
but it's not over.

723
00:44:55.028 --> 00:44:56.321
- It is over.
- No.

724
00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:57.990
Leave it alone.
Let it go.

725
00:44:58.157 --> 00:45:00.367
I'm coming.

726
00:45:00.534 --> 00:45:02.744
Mama, I'm coming!

727
00:45:05.164 --> 00:45:08.500
- Look, he understands.
- But...

728
00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:10.878
It's hard,
but he really does.

729
00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:13.714
Summer's over
and it's time to go home.

730
00:45:13.881 --> 00:45:16.216
If he wants to talk to you,
he'll write. If not?

731
00:45:21.763 --> 00:45:23.807
Okay.

732
00:45:23.974 --> 00:45:27.144
Okay, can you just... can you just
tell him that I love him, then?

733
00:45:27.311 --> 00:45:30.314
- Can you do that?
- I'll tell him.

734
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:33.192
Thank you.

735
00:45:35.486 --> 00:45:37.070
Bye, Fin.

736
00:46:19.112 --> 00:46:20.489
She's gone.

737
00:46:35.504 --> 00:46:38.757
Summer romances end
for all kinds of reasons.

738
00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:41.802
But when all
is said and done,

739
00:46:41.969 --> 00:46:43.679
they have
one thing in common:

740
00:46:43.846 --> 00:46:46.765
They are shooting stars...

741
00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:49.852
a spectacular moment
of light in the heavens,

742
00:46:50.018 --> 00:46:51.645
a fleeting glimpse
of eternity.

743
00:46:51.812 --> 00:46:56.024
And in a flash,
they're gone.

744
00:46:57.651 --> 00:46:59.236
Noah was desperate.

745
00:46:59.403 --> 00:47:01.446
He wrote to Allie
that he was sorry and stupid

746
00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:03.407
for breaking up
with her.

747
00:47:03.574 --> 00:47:07.202
He wrote to tell her that he still loved
her, and he wanted to see her.

748
00:47:07.369 --> 00:47:11.456
And that if she would write back,
he would come to wherever she was.

749
00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:17.087
He wrote one letter
a day for a year...

750
00:47:17.254 --> 00:47:19.548
365 letters,

751
00:47:19.715 --> 00:47:21.341
but they all
went unanswered.

752
00:47:21.508 --> 00:47:24.136
Hey Fred!
Nothing?

753
00:47:24.303 --> 00:47:25.470
Sorry.

754
00:47:25.637 --> 00:47:28.223
All right,
thank you.

755
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.267
Finally, after a year
of silence,

756
00:47:30.434 --> 00:47:34.438
he decided to put it all behind him
and start a new life.

757
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:36.398
So he wrote
a farewell letter

758
00:47:36.565 --> 00:47:39.026
And he and Fin
packed their bags

759
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:40.903
and headed for Atlanta.

760
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.863
Noah! Noah!

761
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.865
Noah!

762
00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:47.659
Come on,
listen to this!

763
00:47:47.826 --> 00:47:53.457
A state of war has existed

764
00:47:53.624 --> 00:47:56.418
between
the United States and the...

765
00:47:56.585 --> 00:47:58.212
The Constitution
of the United States,

766
00:47:58.378 --> 00:48:01.590
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

767
00:48:01.757 --> 00:48:04.676
Noah and Fin
enlisted together.

768
00:48:04.843 --> 00:48:06.720
And after two years
of chasing Rommel

769
00:48:06.887 --> 00:48:08.555
through
the North African desert,

770
00:48:08.722 --> 00:48:12.267
they were deployed
to Patton's Third Army in Europe.

771
00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:22.861
Go!

772
00:48:28.283 --> 00:48:29.743
Fin!

773
00:48:53.892 --> 00:48:55.686
Do I contradict myself?

774
00:48:55.853 --> 00:48:57.896
Very well then,
I contradict myself.

775
00:48:58.063 --> 00:49:00.107
Allie was in her
third year of college

776
00:49:00.274 --> 00:49:03.235
when she volunteered
as a nurse's aid.

777
00:49:03.402 --> 00:49:06.029
To her, the broken men
with shattered bodies,

778
00:49:06.196 --> 00:49:09.116
who filled the ward
were all Noah.

779
00:49:09.283 --> 00:49:12.202
Or someone who fought
beside him in the jungle

780
00:49:12.369 --> 00:49:14.997
or frozen
snow swept road.

781
00:49:15.164 --> 00:49:16.456
I'm gonna lift you up.

782
00:49:16.623 --> 00:49:18.000
Ready?

783
00:49:18.167 --> 00:49:21.253
There we go.

784
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.673
Now, I'm gonna bring
this leg over.

785
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.883
- Set it on the stool.
- All right.

786
00:49:26.049 --> 00:49:28.510
- You okay?
- Yeah.

787
00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:31.889
Miss, can I
ask you a question?

788
00:49:32.055 --> 00:49:33.891
Hmm?

789
00:49:34.057 --> 00:49:35.767
I noticed that you
aren't wearing a ring.

790
00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:40.272
And I was wondering
if I could take you out.

791
00:49:41.773 --> 00:49:44.151
- Excuse me?
- On a date.

792
00:49:47.196 --> 00:49:49.948
Now, before you go
and say no,

793
00:49:50.115 --> 00:49:53.410
I'll have you know that
I am an excellent dancer

794
00:49:53.577 --> 00:49:56.580
and my intentions
are completely dishonorable.

795
00:50:01.126 --> 00:50:04.296
Okay, okay
"Casanova," come on.

796
00:50:04.463 --> 00:50:06.423
Let's just
get you better,

797
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.800
then we'll talk
about a date, okay?

798
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.562
Would you get
a load of him?

799
00:50:23.357 --> 00:50:25.901
Oh my gosh,
he is dreamy.

800
00:50:26.902 --> 00:50:28.862
- What is he doing here?
- Mmm.

801
00:50:29.029 --> 00:50:30.280
He's staring at you.

802
00:50:30.447 --> 00:50:31.824
Oh, miss?

803
00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:36.036
I'm all better.

804
00:50:37.162 --> 00:50:39.665
Now, how's
about that date?

805
00:50:39.832 --> 00:50:41.792
Allie was surprised
how quickly

806
00:50:41.959 --> 00:50:44.294
she fell in love
with Lon Hammond.

807
00:50:49.091 --> 00:50:50.592
He was handsome, smart,

808
00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:53.470
funny, sophisticated
and charming.

809
00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:55.722
Hey!

810
00:51:02.229 --> 00:51:04.606
He also came from
old Southern money,

811
00:51:04.773 --> 00:51:06.567
and was
fabulously wealthy.

812
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:14.700
What?

813
00:51:18.704 --> 00:51:19.663
Hya!

814
00:51:21.874 --> 00:51:23.250
Oh, what's happening?

815
00:51:23.417 --> 00:51:24.793
- Where you going?
- Where they going?

816
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.588
- See you later, sweetheart.
- Oh dear, look at that.

817
00:51:30.132 --> 00:51:32.759
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about
why we shouldn't get married.

818
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:35.429
Okay, I give up,
why shouldn't we get married?

819
00:51:35.596 --> 00:51:37.931
Well see, that's the thing,
I couldn't think of anything at first.

820
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:40.767
An then, it just dawned on me.
Your parents...

821
00:51:40.934 --> 00:51:42.644
- My parents?
- Absolutely.

822
00:51:42.811 --> 00:51:44.605
Your old mom and dad.
Thank you for that.

823
00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:45.981
Mom?

824
00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:47.608
You see, the problem is
that they love me.

825
00:51:47.774 --> 00:51:49.193
- I'm exactly the type of man
- They do.

826
00:51:49.359 --> 00:51:50.944
- They want you to end up with.
- Really?

827
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:54.573
You know, I'm wealthy,
I'm from the South, I got a decent job.

828
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.910
You know, I'm an incredible dancer,
I'm a really smart guy.

829
00:51:58.076 --> 00:52:00.412
You look great.

830
00:52:00.579 --> 00:52:02.915
- I like to think...
- So what's the problem, huh?

831
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:05.459
- Now just this, if you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

832
00:52:05.626 --> 00:52:07.127
Now listen close.

833
00:52:07.294 --> 00:52:08.962
- If you marry me...
- Mm-hmm.

834
00:52:09.129 --> 00:52:12.299
Then you will have lost a life long
battle of defiance against them.

835
00:52:12.466 --> 00:52:14.009
Oh my goodness,
what are we going to do?

836
00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:15.302
- I do not know.
- Huh!

837
00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:18.263
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?

838
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.474
Hey, band,
you feeling all right?!

839
00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:22.476
Ooh bop sha bam,
shi bimmy bop

840
00:52:22.643 --> 00:52:24.978
- Oh bop sha bam, shi bimmy bop
- You say it!

841
00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:27.481
- Ally ally ally ooh
- Ally ally ally ooh

842
00:52:27.648 --> 00:52:29.441
- Olly olly olly ooh
- Olly olly olly ooh

843
00:52:29.608 --> 00:52:33.445
- Whooly ooh
- Whooly ooh

844
00:52:35.322 --> 00:52:38.492
See Allie, I think...
damn it, I think you have to marry me.

845
00:52:38.659 --> 00:52:40.619
- I think you need to marry me.
- I do?

846
00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:41.829
- Yes you do.
- I do, why?

847
00:52:41.995 --> 00:52:44.164
Because if you do,
you parents will always know

848
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:47.793
the unhappiness that you feel for
not being able to disappoint them.

849
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.629
I think you may
have overlooked one minor detail.

850
00:52:50.796 --> 00:52:51.839
And what's that?

851
00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:54.675
Well, you see you have to
get their permission first.

852
00:52:54.842 --> 00:52:57.636
And I think you may have overestimated
their affection for you.

853
00:52:57.803 --> 00:52:59.137
Is that right?

854
00:52:59.304 --> 00:53:01.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I don't think so.

855
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:02.683
Then why not?

856
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:05.143
Oh, 'cause I asked them
already and they said yes.

857
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:07.104
What?

858
00:53:10.691 --> 00:53:12.317
One more thing.

859
00:53:13.986 --> 00:53:15.863
I love you.

860
00:53:16.029 --> 00:53:18.157
Will you marry me, honey?

861
00:53:18.323 --> 00:53:21.285
I know I kid around a lot,
but I'm crazy about you.

862
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:26.165
Marry me? Make me
the happiest man in the world.

863
00:53:28.917 --> 00:53:31.003
Yes. Yes!

864
00:53:35.257 --> 00:53:38.552
- Just hold tight.
- Where are you going?

865
00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:41.430
Oh my God. Mama.

866
00:53:41.597 --> 00:53:43.348
Okay, stop the band.

867
00:53:43.515 --> 00:53:45.225
Excuse me. I'd like
everyone here to know

868
00:53:45.392 --> 00:53:47.311
that this young lady
and I are getting married.

869
00:53:55.068 --> 00:53:57.779
She agreed with all her heart,
but couldn't understand

870
00:53:57.946 --> 00:54:00.991
why at the very moment
she said yes,

871
00:54:01.158 --> 00:54:04.161
Noah's face
came to her mind.

872
00:54:14.463 --> 00:54:16.965
Hey, Noah, yeah!

873
00:54:17.132 --> 00:54:19.718
Oh, good to see you.
Let me see you.

874
00:54:19.885 --> 00:54:21.470
You bleeding anywhere?
No?

875
00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:22.971
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

876
00:54:23.138 --> 00:54:24.598
Oh, I love you.

877
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:27.476
Come on, there's something
I got to show you.

878
00:54:27.643 --> 00:54:29.061
- Come on.
- All right.

879
00:54:33.732 --> 00:54:35.275
What's going on?

880
00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:36.610
What is this?

881
00:54:36.777 --> 00:54:38.278
Here.

882
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:39.947
I sold the house.

883
00:54:41.406 --> 00:54:43.283
- You sold the house?
- Yup.

884
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.160
Gotta be out
by the end of the month.

885
00:54:45.327 --> 00:54:48.080
Between that and your GI Bill,
you ought to be able to get it now.

886
00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:51.083
- Get what?
- Your dream house.

887
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:52.459
- The Windsor Plantation.
- Dad...

888
00:54:52.626 --> 00:54:54.628
Now, don't Dad me,
I don't want to hear about it.

889
00:54:54.795 --> 00:54:58.257
I already talked to the bank,
they're gonna give you the loan.

890
00:54:58.423 --> 00:55:02.135
- Well, I can't let you sell your house.
- It's done.

891
00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:05.764
It's a good thing.
You should do it.

892
00:55:11.395 --> 00:55:14.273
Wait a second. You sell the house,
where are you gonna live?

893
00:55:14.439 --> 00:55:15.858
With you, dummy,
what do you think?

894
00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:18.360
Somebody's got
to help you fix it up.

895
00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:29.079
Noah took a look
at the house,

896
00:55:29.246 --> 00:55:31.623
but only saw
one thing...

897
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.959
Allie.

898
00:55:34.126 --> 00:55:37.337
He decided right there
to fulfill his life-long dream.

899
00:55:37.504 --> 00:55:42.092
He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

900
00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:48.974
And when Noah went to Charleston
to get the building plans approved,

901
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:53.020
fate stepped in
and dealt him a sweet card.

902
00:56:00.027 --> 00:56:02.779
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus.

903
00:56:02.946 --> 00:56:05.032
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus
until I get to the depot.

904
00:56:05.199 --> 00:56:07.201
No, no, no, please stop
the bus now. Please!

905
00:56:07.367 --> 00:56:08.827
Do you understand
English, pal?

906
00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:12.164
No one gets off till we get
to the depot. Now sit down.

907
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:14.833
- God.
- Hey!

908
00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:20.839
Watch it, screwball!

909
00:56:21.006 --> 00:56:22.591
What are you doing?

910
00:56:22.758 --> 00:56:24.510
Hey!

911
00:56:24.676 --> 00:56:26.178
How old is your daughter now?

912
00:56:26.345 --> 00:56:28.597
- Well, you mind.
- He's right over there.

913
00:56:47.241 --> 00:56:49.034
Baby, hello.

914
00:56:58.752 --> 00:57:00.212
- Oh!
- Hold it.

915
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.761
Oh, come with it.

916
00:57:13.851 --> 00:57:15.561
After seeing Allie that day,

917
00:57:15.727 --> 00:57:19.064
something inside
Noah snapped.

918
00:57:19.231 --> 00:57:20.691
He got the notion
into his head

919
00:57:20.858 --> 00:57:22.276
that if he restored
the old house

920
00:57:22.442 --> 00:57:24.653
where they had
come that night,

921
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.282
Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

922
00:57:28.448 --> 00:57:30.576
Some called it
a labor of love.

923
00:57:30.742 --> 00:57:32.870
Others called it
something else.

924
00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:37.082
But in fact,
Noah had gone a little mad.

925
00:57:37.249 --> 00:57:38.917
- Excuse me.
- Would...

926
00:57:39.918 --> 00:57:41.461
It's time to eat.

927
00:57:41.628 --> 00:57:43.589
Lunch will be served
in the Sun Room today.

928
00:57:46.258 --> 00:57:49.970
The melon is good.
I had a bite.

929
00:57:50.137 --> 00:57:52.514
Did they ever
see each other again?

930
00:57:52.681 --> 00:57:54.808
Noah and Allie?

931
00:57:54.975 --> 00:57:57.311
Now you don't want
me to spoil the end of the story

932
00:57:57.478 --> 00:58:00.314
before I get
to the good part, do you?

933
00:58:00.481 --> 00:58:02.608
Where did I leave off?

934
00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:04.276
I shall not want.

935
00:58:04.443 --> 00:58:06.653
When Noah's father
died in November,

936
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.447
the house
was all he had.

937
00:58:08.614 --> 00:58:10.824
He leadeth me down...

938
00:58:28.842 --> 00:58:31.678
In time, Noah
finished the house.

939
00:58:31.845 --> 00:58:33.847
Okay, smile.
Here we go.

940
00:58:36.016 --> 00:58:38.560
He took a good look
at what he had accomplished,

941
00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:41.563
got rip-roaring drunk
for 10 days,

942
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:44.900
thought seriously
about setting it on fire,

943
00:58:45.067 --> 00:58:47.069
then finally
put the house up for sale.

944
00:58:47.236 --> 00:58:49.029
I'm prepared
to offer you this much.

945
00:58:51.031 --> 00:58:52.783
He had a number
of interested buyers,

946
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:55.702
but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

947
00:58:55.869 --> 00:58:57.204
No.

948
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.289
Either the bids
were too low,

949
00:58:59.456 --> 00:59:01.625
or if they met
his asking price,

950
00:59:01.792 --> 00:59:04.253
he felt it was worth
a lot more.

951
00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:07.172
It's a lot of money,
but I'll take it.

952
00:59:10.133 --> 00:59:11.844
$50,000.

953
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:14.805
- That's more than my asking price.
- That's right.

954
00:59:14.972 --> 00:59:16.348
It's a great deal more.

955
00:59:21.145 --> 00:59:24.606
He told the man that offered him
$5,000 over his price

956
00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:27.609
that no one in his right mind
would do that

957
00:59:27.776 --> 00:59:30.529
and he wouldn't have
a lunatic living in his house.

958
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:36.785
He worked out his frustration with life
on the creek every morning.

959
00:59:38.412 --> 00:59:41.999
And in the evenings,
to temper the sting of loneliness,

960
00:59:42.166 --> 00:59:44.585
there was Martha Shaw.

961
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:46.378
Martha was a war widow

962
00:59:46.545 --> 00:59:49.214
who lived in Quail Ridge,
a town away.

963
00:59:53.427 --> 00:59:56.054
So you want to go out
tomorrow?

964
00:59:56.221 --> 00:59:57.764
I got to work.

965
00:59:57.931 --> 00:59:59.766
Well, we could
down to the river if you want to.

966
00:59:59.933 --> 01:00:01.602
Next week, sometime.

967
01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:03.270
Maybe we could
take a drive somewhere?

968
01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:05.230
No.

969
01:00:05.397 --> 01:00:07.566
Well,
I'm just asking you.

970
01:00:19.328 --> 01:00:21.497
What do you want, Noah?

971
01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:26.126
What do you mean,
what do I want?

972
01:00:28.837 --> 01:00:30.631
From me.

973
01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:38.388
Sometimes when you talk to me,
you don't even see me.

974
01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.854
Look, a woman knows
when a man looks into her eyes

975
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:47.898
and sees someone else.

976
01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:57.407
Now you know I want to give you
all the things that you want,

977
01:00:59.326 --> 01:01:01.662
right?

978
01:01:04.873 --> 01:01:06.375
But I can't,

979
01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.419
because they're gone...

980
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:14.216
they're broken.

981
01:01:17.302 --> 01:01:19.137
All right?

982
01:01:42.369 --> 01:01:43.871
Is the veil too much?

983
01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:45.956
Are you kidding?
You look perfect!

984
01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:49.001
You're the most
beautiful bride.

985
01:01:50.586 --> 01:01:53.046
- You look gorgeous, honey.
- Thank you.

986
01:01:53.213 --> 01:01:57.050
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress,
he's gonna go crazy.

987
01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:59.803
He won't be able
to take his eyes off you,

988
01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.054
or his hands.

989
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:02.723
Oh, you're bad!

990
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.349
Have you seen
this morning's paper?

991
01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:06.477
The "Daily Journal" says
that you are going to be

992
01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:09.730
- the social highlight of the season.
- Of the season?

993
01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:12.691
This is gonna be a celebration the likes
of which this town's never seen!

994
01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:15.903
She doesn't plan,
she plots, doesn't she?

995
01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:21.074
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming.
- He better. Let me see.

996
01:02:25.162 --> 01:02:26.455
Oh, boy.

997
01:02:53.565 --> 01:02:55.651
- All right Savannah, where are we at?
- We're 82 now.

998
01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:06.203
- Memphis, where are at?
- We're 89 now.

999
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:07.371
89, great,
up from 85.

1000
01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:08.539
- Sir?
- Yes.

1001
01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.123
You have a visitor.

1002
01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:13.919
Well, hello.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.

1003
01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:17.130
I'm... I'm so sorry,
I should have called.

1004
01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:20.217
Baby, what are you talking about?
You don't have to call.

1005
01:03:20.384 --> 01:03:22.427
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- All right.

1006
01:03:22.594 --> 01:03:24.471
Yes, sir.
Miss Allie.

1007
01:03:24.638 --> 01:03:25.806
Ma'am.

1008
01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:34.022
So what's up?

1009
01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:37.442
I don't paint anymore.

1010
01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:41.613
I used to paint
all the time.

1011
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.948
I really loved it.

1012
01:03:43.115 --> 01:03:45.951
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1013
01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.538
So paint.

1014
01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:51.665
I will.

1015
01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:56.628
- I'm gonna start.
- Great.

1016
01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:04.386
Is everything okay?

1017
01:04:07.139 --> 01:04:08.599
I need to get away.

1018
01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:10.851
Okay.

1019
01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:13.979
I need to take care
of a few things.

1020
01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:15.981
I need to clear
my head.

1021
01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:18.358
Okay,
should I be worried?

1022
01:04:18.525 --> 01:04:21.904
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

1023
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:25.699
Listen, are you
all right?

1024
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.286
- Yeah.
- Okay, then go.

1025
01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:31.413
Take your time,
do whatever you need to do.

1026
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.665
It's okay to be nervous,
all right?

1027
01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:35.876
It's normal to get
cold feet before your wedding.

1028
01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:38.170
No, no second
thoughts, huh-uh.

1029
01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:44.843
I love you.

1030
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:47.721
I'm going to be back from Seabrook
in a couple of days, okay?

1031
01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:52.518
- Seabrook?
- Yeah, Seabrook.

1032
01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:39.857
Hello.

1033
01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.364
I saw your picture
in the paper,

1034
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:49.199
the one with you
and the house.

1035
01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:52.077
And I just wanted to come
and see if you were okay.

1036
01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:54.288
I mean, I wasn't
in the neighborhood or anything.

1037
01:05:54.454 --> 01:05:55.455
I just...

1038
01:06:03.255 --> 01:06:04.673
So are you okay?

1039
01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.096
Okay, good.

1040
01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:17.936
I'm a stupid woman,
I shouldn't have come.

1041
01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:41.126
You want to come in?

1042
01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:43.128
Okay.

1043
01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:47.799
This is a good story.

1044
01:06:47.966 --> 01:06:50.052
I'm glad you like it.

1045
01:06:51.428 --> 01:06:53.138
I think
I've heard it before.

1046
01:06:55.224 --> 01:06:56.266
Yes.

1047
01:06:57.559 --> 01:07:00.187
Perhaps more than once?

1048
01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:01.688
Doctor needs
to see you.

1049
01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:03.982
- Me? Now?
- No, him.

1050
01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:06.485
But he hasn't finished
reading his story.

1051
01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:08.904
I'll read some more
when I'm through with the doctor.

1052
01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:10.989
This shouldn't take
too long.

1053
01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:12.741
- All right.
- Don't you go away.

1054
01:07:12.908 --> 01:07:15.661
I'll be right back.

1055
01:07:15.828 --> 01:07:18.831
While you waiting, maybe you'd like
to play the piano for a few minutes.

1056
01:07:18.997 --> 01:07:19.873
You do like that.

1057
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.084
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

1058
01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:25.546
- I don't know any tunes.
- You can read music.

1059
01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:28.882
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm.

1060
01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.596
Who are you?

1061
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:37.891
I'm Dr. Barnwell,
one of the new attending physicians.

1062
01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:40.519
We haven't met,
so I thought I'd examine you myself.

1063
01:07:43.522 --> 01:07:45.315
Okay, so I see here

1064
01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:48.569
that you've had two heart attacks
over the last 18 months.

1065
01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:50.904
Yeah, minor ones,
I think one was angina.

1066
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.907
- Okay, any complications?
- Nope, feel fine.

1067
01:07:54.074 --> 01:07:56.451
Okay, deep breath
for me.

1068
01:07:56.618 --> 01:07:59.621
Okay, one more time.

1069
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:03.208
And deep breath.

1070
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:06.628
And one more.

1071
01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:09.631
Terrific, terrific.
You still taking your medication?

1072
01:08:09.798 --> 01:08:12.593
- Every day, twice a day.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

1073
01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:15.179
Okay, you can
put your shirt on.

1074
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:22.769
So I understand that you
read to Miss Hamilton.

1075
01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:25.397
Yeah, to help
her remember.

1076
01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:27.733
- Hmm.
- You don't think it'll help?

1077
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.651
No, I don't.

1078
01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.154
She remembers, Doc.

1079
01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:35.449
I read to her
and she remembers.

1080
01:08:35.616 --> 01:08:38.076
Not always,
but she remembers.

1081
01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:40.245
But senile dementia
is irreversible.

1082
01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:42.039
It's degenerative.

1083
01:08:42.206 --> 01:08:45.083
After a certain point,
its victims don't come back.

1084
01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:47.002
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me.

1085
01:08:47.169 --> 01:08:49.087
Well, I just don't want
you to get your hopes up.

1086
01:08:49.254 --> 01:08:52.925
Well, thanks, Doc,
but you know what they say?

1087
01:08:53.091 --> 01:08:56.595
Science goes only so far
and then comes God.

1088
01:08:56.762 --> 01:08:58.430
Then comes God.

1089
01:09:00.808 --> 01:09:03.894
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her.
You through with me?

1090
01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:25.791
I guess they flipped
that page.

1091
01:09:25.958 --> 01:09:29.294
No, that she's playing
by memory.

1092
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.882
His name
is Lon Hammond, Jr.

1093
01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:36.635
Hammond?
As in Hammond Cotton?

1094
01:09:36.802 --> 01:09:38.220
As in Hammond Cotton.

1095
01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:40.639
Well, your parents
must love him.

1096
01:09:40.806 --> 01:09:45.435
He's a really good man, Noah.
You'd really like him.

1097
01:09:45.602 --> 01:09:47.521
You love him?

1098
01:09:48.814 --> 01:09:52.776
Yeah, I do.
I love him very much.

1099
01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:01.535
Well, that's that.

1100
01:10:01.702 --> 01:10:05.247
You marry Lon
and we can be friends...

1101
01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:08.250
right?

1102
01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:10.169
Right.

1103
01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:17.342
Are you hungry?

1104
01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:19.636
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

1105
01:10:21.388 --> 01:10:22.556
Umm...

1106
01:10:31.857 --> 01:10:33.609
I have to warn you,
I'm a cheap drunk.

1107
01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:37.279
A couple more of these and you're gonna
be carrying me right out of here.

1108
01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:40.240
Well, you go slow then, I don't want
to have to take advantage of you.

1109
01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:42.784
You wouldn't dare.
I'm a married woman.

1110
01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:44.703
Not yet.

1111
01:10:51.376 --> 01:10:52.794
What?

1112
01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:57.382
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1113
01:11:00.511 --> 01:11:02.471
Just memories.

1114
01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:09.394
This room.

1115
01:11:12.022 --> 01:11:14.525
This...
is this where we...

1116
01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:17.694
This is the room?

1117
01:11:23.075 --> 01:11:24.701
Huh...

1118
01:11:33.126 --> 01:11:35.629
- I'm full.
- Me too.

1119
01:11:39.258 --> 01:11:41.426
"Oh how your fingers
drowse me.

1120
01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:43.929
Your breath falls
around me like dew.

1121
01:11:44.096 --> 01:11:47.099
Your pulse lulls
the tympans of my ears.

1122
01:11:47.266 --> 01:11:49.643
I feel a merge
from head to foot.

1123
01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.728
Delicious enough. "

1124
01:11:53.564 --> 01:11:55.440
It was real, wasn't it?

1125
01:11:56.775 --> 01:11:59.903
You and me.

1126
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:03.574
Such a long time ago,
we were just a couple of kids.

1127
01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:10.414
But we really loved
each other, didn't we?

1128
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:19.882
I should go.

1129
01:12:23.635 --> 01:12:25.304
Goodbye.

1130
01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:29.224
Do you think
you could back tomorrow morning?

1131
01:12:29.391 --> 01:12:31.351
There's some place
I'd like to show you.

1132
01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.772
Please.

1133
01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:40.277
- Okay.
- Okay.

1134
01:12:52.581 --> 01:12:54.500
She had come back into his life

1135
01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:56.543
like a sudden flame,

1136
01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.254
blazing and streaming
into his heart.

1137
01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:01.507
Noah stayed up
all night

1138
01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:05.093
contemplating the certain agony
he knew would be his,

1139
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.679
if he were
to lose her twice.

1140
01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:11.683
Oh, I do wish I could
figure out the end of this story.

1141
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:14.520
The children are here.

1142
01:13:14.686 --> 01:13:16.021
Children?

1143
01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:18.190
- Not yours, his.
- Oh...

1144
01:13:18.357 --> 01:13:20.192
Do you mind?

1145
01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:22.319
Why, I'd love
to meet them.

1146
01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:25.364
Come over here.

1147
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:27.783
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart, how are you?

1148
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.451
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Maggie.

1149
01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:32.246
Hi, I'm Allie.

1150
01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:34.289
- Hi, I'm Mary Allen.
- Mary Allen.

1151
01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:36.792
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1152
01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:38.377
- Hi.
- Hi, Maggie.

1153
01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:40.963
Maggie, how are you?

1154
01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:42.047
Hello there, honey.

1155
01:13:42.214 --> 01:13:43.173
Hi, Davanee.

1156
01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.717
- What a pretty name.
- Thank you.

1157
01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:49.888
- Oh...
- Oh, how cute, thank you.

1158
01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:54.017
- And who's this?
- Edmond.

1159
01:13:54.184 --> 01:13:55.686
Hi, Edmond.

1160
01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.575
You know, I think
I'll run on up

1161
01:14:09.741 --> 01:14:12.619
and take my afternoon
nap, all right?

1162
01:14:12.786 --> 01:14:15.914
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- There you go.

1163
01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:17.749
- All right. Good.
- Thank you.

1164
01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.751
I'll read some more later.

1165
01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:22.421
All right, thank you.

1166
01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:24.631
I'm so happy
to meet you all.

1167
01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:27.968
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

1168
01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:29.261
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodbye.

1169
01:14:29.428 --> 01:14:30.929
Bye.

1170
01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:34.975
- She seems good today.
- She is good.

1171
01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:39.146
I don't know, there's
something about today.

1172
01:14:39.313 --> 01:14:41.607
Maybe it's a day
for a miracle.

1173
01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:46.945
Daddy, come home.

1174
01:14:47.112 --> 01:14:49.281
Mama doesn't know us.

1175
01:14:49.448 --> 01:14:52.117
She doesn't recognize you.
She'll never understand.

1176
01:14:52.284 --> 01:14:54.286
We miss you.

1177
01:14:54.453 --> 01:14:56.163
This is crazy,
you living here.

1178
01:14:56.330 --> 01:15:01.001
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom.
We can take shifts visiting.

1179
01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:05.130
Look, guys,

1180
01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:07.716
that's my sweetheart
in there.

1181
01:15:07.883 --> 01:15:10.511
I'm not leaving her.

1182
01:15:10.677 --> 01:15:13.430
This is my home now.

1183
01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:15.265
Your mother is my home.

1184
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.023
- Hello?
- Hey, there.

1185
01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.734
Hi, who is this?

1186
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:27.528
It's Lon,
who were you expecting?

1187
01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:30.572
Uh, nobody, I...

1188
01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:33.242
I just... I'm just surprised.
How... how did you find me?

1189
01:15:33.408 --> 01:15:35.160
Well, there's only one
hotel in Seabrook.

1190
01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:37.204
And when you didn't call,
I got worried.

1191
01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:40.541
Where you been?
Are you all right?

1192
01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:44.419
You know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause I
called your hotel about a hundred times.

1193
01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:48.674
I'm fine.

1194
01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:49.883
Anything you want
to tell me?

1195
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.678
- No.
- No?

1196
01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:53.929
No.

1197
01:15:57.766 --> 01:15:59.017
Okay.

1198
01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.397
Lon, I love you.

1199
01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.983
Call you tomorrow?

1200
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.651
Okay.

1201
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:38.932
Noah?

1202
01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:42.144
Noah!

1203
01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:00.120
Hey, there.

1204
01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.253
Well, we better get going,
the rain's coming in.

1205
01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:36.323
- You like it?
- It's spectacular.

1206
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.121
It's like a dream.

1207
01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:47.167
- Do you want to feed them?
- Yeah.

1208
01:18:05.185 --> 01:18:06.687
What are they all
doing here?

1209
01:18:08.438 --> 01:18:10.190
I don't know.

1210
01:18:10.357 --> 01:18:12.985
They're supposed to migrate
to the Guatemala sound.

1211
01:18:13.152 --> 01:18:14.695
They won't stay here?

1212
01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:16.780
No...

1213
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.993
they'll go back
where they came from.

1214
01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:33.338
You're different.

1215
01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:35.966
What do you mean?

1216
01:18:37.634 --> 01:18:40.512
Just the way you look.
Everything.

1217
01:18:40.679 --> 01:18:43.682
You look different too,
but in a good way.

1218
01:18:49.396 --> 01:18:51.440
You know, you're kinda
the same though.

1219
01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:55.152
Yeah?

1220
01:18:55.319 --> 01:18:57.446
Yeah.

1221
01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:01.700
And you really did it.

1222
01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:04.203
- What?
- Everything.

1223
01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:06.079
The house...

1224
01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:09.833
it's beautiful
what you did.

1225
01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:15.881
Well, I promised you
I would.

1226
01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:27.351
Great.

1227
01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:29.520
We got to go.

1228
01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:02.052
Noah!

1229
01:20:54.146 --> 01:20:55.814
Why didn't you
write me?

1230
01:20:56.815 --> 01:20:58.150
Why?

1231
01:20:59.526 --> 01:21:01.528
It wasn't over for me.

1232
01:21:01.695 --> 01:21:04.239
I waited for you
for seven years.

1233
01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:05.991
And now it's too late.

1234
01:21:07.201 --> 01:21:09.995
I wrote you 365 letters.

1235
01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:13.749
I wrote you every day
for a year.

1236
01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:16.168
- You wrote me?
- Yes.

1237
01:21:16.335 --> 01:21:18.128
You...

1238
01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:20.589
It wasn't over.

1239
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:22.716
It still isn't over.

1240
01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:29.259
Oh...

1241
01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.057
You got
to be kidding me.

1242
01:23:36.809 --> 01:23:39.186
All this time,
that's what I'd been missing?

1243
01:23:43.982 --> 01:23:45.859
Let's do it again.

1244
01:23:59.039 --> 01:24:01.166
Noah.

1245
01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:22.896
Noah.

1246
01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:33.782
Wake up.

1247
01:24:35.033 --> 01:24:37.202
- Wake up.
- Um-mmm.

1248
01:24:37.369 --> 01:24:40.122
- Um-mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1249
01:24:40.289 --> 01:24:42.124
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm...

1250
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.920
- Hi.
- You're trying to kill me, woman.

1251
01:24:47.087 --> 01:24:49.465
- Huh-uh.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:51.925
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

1253
01:24:53.469 --> 01:24:55.179
I need rest.

1254
01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:59.600
I need food
so I can regain my strength.

1255
01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:03.479
Okay, what do you want?

1256
01:25:06.064 --> 01:25:08.901
Umm... umm...

1257
01:25:09.067 --> 01:25:10.903
some pancakes.

1258
01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:13.113
Okay.

1259
01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.240
And bacon.

1260
01:25:15.407 --> 01:25:18.368
- Okay.
- And some chicken.

1261
01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:06.750
She's the one,
isn't she?

1262
01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:14.842
Can I meet her?

1263
01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:18.178
I'd really like to meet her.

1264
01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:20.180
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Martha.

1265
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.936
So this is Martha?

1266
01:26:26.103 --> 01:26:28.939
Hi, I'm Allie.

1267
01:26:29.106 --> 01:26:31.108
I've heard
a lot about you.

1268
01:26:32.317 --> 01:26:34.111
I've heard
a lot about you, too.

1269
01:26:34.278 --> 01:26:36.113
You want to come in?

1270
01:26:38.407 --> 01:26:39.700
Are you sure?

1271
01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:42.953
Yeah, yeah,
Noah's just saying how hungry he was.

1272
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.539
And, you know,
you could put on a pot of tea.

1273
01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.084
Come on in.

1274
01:26:52.254 --> 01:26:54.089
Come on in.

1275
01:27:03.182 --> 01:27:04.850
It was nice meeting you,
Martha.

1276
01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:07.186
- Nice meeting you too.
- Goodbye.

1277
01:27:07.352 --> 01:27:08.896
Take care.

1278
01:27:27.873 --> 01:27:31.502
She's sensational.
She really is.

1279
01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:34.671
I'm really glad
that I came, Noah.

1280
01:27:40.052 --> 01:27:42.179
I'd forgotten
what it's like.

1281
01:27:46.266 --> 01:27:49.228
For the first time
since I lost Richard,

1282
01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:51.855
I feel like I've got something
to look forward to.

1283
01:28:37.776 --> 01:28:39.486
Mmm...

1284
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.246
Lon is on his way here.

1285
01:30:14.581 --> 01:30:17.543
I'm afraid your father spilled
the beans about Noah,

1286
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:19.503
and when Lon didn't hear
from you again last night,

1287
01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:20.629
he decided to come.

1288
01:30:20.796 --> 01:30:23.841
Well, that's great.
That's just terrific.

1289
01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:27.511
You, me, Noah and Lon,
one big happy family.

1290
01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:35.853
Tell me about
the letters, Mother.

1291
01:30:36.019 --> 01:30:38.272
- Is it true?
- Yes.

1292
01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:41.900
You watched me
cry myself to sleep

1293
01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:44.361
for months and months

1294
01:30:44.528 --> 01:30:46.864
and you never
said anything.

1295
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:48.574
- How could you do that?
- I'm sorry.

1296
01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.993
- You're sorry? You're sorry?
- Yes, I am... I am sorry.

1297
01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.703
Because of you,
my entire life is ruined!

1298
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:54.371
Okay, yes,
I stole your letters.

1299
01:30:54.538 --> 01:30:56.039
It was wrong,
but stop being dramatic

1300
01:30:56.206 --> 01:30:58.167
and at least take some
of the responsibility.

1301
01:31:00.294 --> 01:31:03.088
You came down here.
You knew what you were doing.

1302
01:31:03.255 --> 01:31:04.506
You knew this would happen.

1303
01:31:04.673 --> 01:31:06.675
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?

1304
01:31:06.842 --> 01:31:08.427
You are unbelievable.

1305
01:31:08.594 --> 01:31:10.721
Unbelievable.

1306
01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:16.852
Go on and get
some clothes on.

1307
01:31:17.019 --> 01:31:18.979
Let's take a drive.

1308
01:31:19.146 --> 01:31:21.732
Let's take a drive? Why would I want
to go anywhere with you?

1309
01:31:21.899 --> 01:31:25.402
Because I might know you
a little better than you think.

1310
01:31:25.569 --> 01:31:27.946
And I don't want
you waking up one morning

1311
01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:29.615
thinking that
if you'd known everything,

1312
01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:31.325
you might have
done something different.

1313
01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:47.841
What are we
doing here, Mama?

1314
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.137
Do you see
that man, there?

1315
01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:57.684
Mm-hmm.

1316
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:02.981
Don't look like it now,
but 25 years ago...

1317
01:32:04.566 --> 01:32:07.444
oh my goodness,
he was really something.

1318
01:32:07.611 --> 01:32:10.239
We were out of our minds
in love, let me tell you.

1319
01:32:14.576 --> 01:32:16.078
Wow.

1320
01:32:17.496 --> 01:32:19.706
Well, naturally,
your grandfather was furious, so...

1321
01:32:19.873 --> 01:32:22.084
we decided
to run away.

1322
01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:28.590
We didn't even make the next town
before the police picked us up.

1323
01:32:31.093 --> 01:32:33.262
But that was then.

1324
01:32:35.514 --> 01:32:38.517
You know sometimes
when I'm in the area,

1325
01:32:38.684 --> 01:32:41.311
I just stop here
and watch him,

1326
01:32:44.148 --> 01:32:47.901
trying to picture how different my life
might have been.

1327
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.043
I want you to know
that I love your father.

1328
01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:07.129
- Mama, I'm...
- No, goddamn it, this is important

1329
01:33:07.296 --> 01:33:09.465
and you need
to hear it. I do.

1330
01:33:09.631 --> 01:33:12.009
He is a wonderful man.

1331
01:33:12.176 --> 01:33:15.220
He is good to me
and I don't deserve him.

1332
01:33:15.387 --> 01:33:18.182
I love him, Allie,
I do, I love him.

1333
01:33:21.435 --> 01:33:22.895
I know.

1334
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:30.027
Oh, God.

1335
01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:34.406
Oh, this is just
very embarrassing.

1336
01:33:34.573 --> 01:33:37.784
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.

1337
01:33:37.951 --> 01:33:40.662
Look at me,
the big old bawl-bag.

1338
01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:45.334
It's crazy.

1339
01:33:53.008 --> 01:33:56.428
I don't even know
who that person is.

1340
01:34:05.062 --> 01:34:06.563
Oh, boy.

1341
01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:36.135
Okay.

1342
01:34:45.978 --> 01:34:47.437
Allie!

1343
01:35:04.288 --> 01:35:05.956
Here.

1344
01:35:10.836 --> 01:35:13.881
I hope you make
the right choice.

1345
01:35:40.032 --> 01:35:42.326
Interesting morning?

1346
01:35:42.493 --> 01:35:43.494
Yeah.

1347
01:35:45.913 --> 01:35:47.581
Lon's here in town.

1348
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.544
He's here?

1349
01:35:54.505 --> 01:35:56.590
Yeah, we saw
his car on the way,

1350
01:35:56.757 --> 01:35:58.342
at the hotel.

1351
01:36:04.765 --> 01:36:05.849
Huh.

1352
01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.437
I see you
got my letters.

1353
01:36:14.024 --> 01:36:15.859
Finally.

1354
01:36:22.741 --> 01:36:24.368
What are you
going to do, Al?

1355
01:36:28.705 --> 01:36:30.791
I don't know.

1356
01:36:37.923 --> 01:36:39.925
We're back to that?

1357
01:36:41.552 --> 01:36:43.137
Are we back there?

1358
01:36:45.013 --> 01:36:47.724
What about the past couple of days?
They happened, you know?

1359
01:36:47.891 --> 01:36:49.935
I know that they happened,
and they were wonderful,

1360
01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:53.188
but they were also
very irresponsible.

1361
01:36:53.355 --> 01:36:55.190
I have a fiance
waiting for me at a hotel,

1362
01:36:55.357 --> 01:36:56.441
who's going
to be crushed

1363
01:36:56.608 --> 01:36:57.985
- when he finds out.
- So you make love to me

1364
01:36:58.152 --> 01:37:00.279
and then you go back
to your husband?

1365
01:37:00.445 --> 01:37:02.156
Was that your plan?

1366
01:37:02.322 --> 01:37:04.032
Was that a test
that I didn't pass?!

1367
01:37:04.199 --> 01:37:06.702
No, I made a promise to a man, he gave
me a ring and I gave him my word.

1368
01:37:06.869 --> 01:37:07.953
And your word is
shot to hell now,

1369
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.538
- don't you think?
- I don't... I don't know.

1370
01:37:09.705 --> 01:37:11.123
I'll find out
when I talk to him.

1371
01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:13.125
This is not about
keeping your promise,

1372
01:37:13.292 --> 01:37:15.752
and it's not about
following your heart,

1373
01:37:15.919 --> 01:37:17.504
it's about security.

1374
01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:19.673
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Money!

1375
01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.675
- What are you ta...
- He's got a lot of money.

1376
01:37:21.842 --> 01:37:23.802
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard.
- Well, I hate you.

1377
01:37:23.969 --> 01:37:25.679
- If you leave here, I hate you.
- You wou...

1378
01:37:25.846 --> 01:37:27.264
- Hate you if you leave here.
- Have you been paying attention

1379
01:37:27.431 --> 01:37:28.390
to anything that's happening?

1380
01:37:28.557 --> 01:37:30.392
I guess not.
I think I must have misread

1381
01:37:30.559 --> 01:37:32.269
- all of those signals.
- I guess you did.

1382
01:37:34.938 --> 01:37:37.566
You're bored.
You're bored and you know it.

1383
01:37:37.733 --> 01:37:40.068
You wouldn't be here
if there wasn't something missing.

1384
01:37:40.235 --> 01:37:42.988
You arrogant
son of a bitch!

1385
01:37:44.156 --> 01:37:45.824
Would you just
stay with me?

1386
01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:47.659
Stay with you?
What for?

1387
01:37:47.826 --> 01:37:50.704
- Look at us, we're already fighting.
- Well, that's what we do.

1388
01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:52.164
We fight.

1389
01:37:52.331 --> 01:37:54.374
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch

1390
01:37:54.541 --> 01:37:56.710
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

1391
01:37:56.877 --> 01:37:59.963
Which you are
99% of the time.

1392
01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:02.341
I'm not afraid
to hurt your feelings.

1393
01:38:02.508 --> 01:38:04.259
They have like
a two second rebound rate

1394
01:38:04.426 --> 01:38:07.095
and you're back doing the next
pain-in-the-ass thing.

1395
01:38:07.262 --> 01:38:08.138
So, what?

1396
01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:10.724
So it's not gonna be easy.
It's gonna be really hard.

1397
01:38:10.891 --> 01:38:13.060
And we're gonna have to work
at this every day,

1398
01:38:13.227 --> 01:38:15.062
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

1399
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:20.108
I want all of you,
forever, you and me, every day.

1400
01:38:20.275 --> 01:38:22.528
Will you do
something for me?

1401
01:38:22.694 --> 01:38:25.739
Please?
Will you just picture your life for me?

1402
01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:30.619
30 years from now,
40 years from now, what's it look like?

1403
01:38:30.786 --> 01:38:33.372
If it's with
that guy, go! Go!

1404
01:38:33.539 --> 01:38:36.124
I lost you once,
I think I could do it again,

1405
01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:38.085
if I thought it's
what you really wanted.

1406
01:38:38.252 --> 01:38:40.712
But don't you take
the easy way out.

1407
01:38:40.879 --> 01:38:42.965
What easy way?
There is no easy way,

1408
01:38:43.132 --> 01:38:45.342
no matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

1409
01:38:45.509 --> 01:38:47.594
Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants.

1410
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:50.305
Stop thinking
about what I want, what he wants,

1411
01:38:50.472 --> 01:38:53.517
what your parents want.
What do you want?

1412
01:38:54.977 --> 01:38:57.062
- What do you want?
- It's not that simple.

1413
01:38:57.229 --> 01:39:00.524
- What do you want?
- It's not...

1414
01:39:01.733 --> 01:39:03.735
Goddamn it,
what do you want?

1415
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:08.407
I have to go.

1416
01:40:17.518 --> 01:40:19.645
My dearest Allie,

1417
01:40:19.812 --> 01:40:23.148
I couldn't sleep last night because
I know that it's over between us.

1418
01:40:25.067 --> 01:40:28.445
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know
that what we had was real.

1419
01:40:30.113 --> 01:40:31.865
And if in some distant
place in the future

1420
01:40:32.032 --> 01:40:34.535
we see each other
in our new lives,

1421
01:40:34.701 --> 01:40:36.203
I'll smile
at you with joy

1422
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:40.374
and remember how
we spent a summer beneath the trees

1423
01:40:40.541 --> 01:40:44.419
learning from each other
and growing in love.

1424
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:04.231
The best love
is the kind that awakens the soul

1425
01:41:04.398 --> 01:41:06.775
and makes us
reach for more,

1426
01:41:06.942 --> 01:41:09.111
that plants a fire
in our hearts

1427
01:41:09.278 --> 01:41:11.947
and brings peace
to our minds.

1428
01:41:12.114 --> 01:41:14.783
And that's what you've
given me.

1429
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:17.703
That's what I'd hoped
to give to you forever.

1430
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:21.915
I love you.
I'll be seeing you, Noah.

1431
01:41:23.208 --> 01:41:26.837
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful story.

1432
01:41:27.004 --> 01:41:28.172
Yes, it is.

1433
01:41:28.338 --> 01:41:31.675
I don't know why,
but it makes me feel sad.

1434
01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:36.513
I know you feel
lost right now,

1435
01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.390
but don't worry,

1436
01:41:38.557 --> 01:41:40.893
nothing is ever lost,
nor can be lost.

1437
01:41:41.059 --> 01:41:44.730
The body sluggish,
aged, cold,

1438
01:41:44.897 --> 01:41:46.982
the embers left

1439
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:48.734
from earlier fires.

1440
01:41:48.901 --> 01:41:50.736
Shall duly flame again.

1441
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.989
Did you write that?

1442
01:41:54.156 --> 01:41:57.534
No, that was Walt Whitman.

1443
01:42:00.037 --> 01:42:01.163
I think I knew him.

1444
01:42:02.164 --> 01:42:03.415
I think you did.

1445
01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:08.462
Shall we go in?
I'm feeling a little chilly.

1446
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:10.547
Okay.

1447
01:42:10.714 --> 01:42:12.508
Thank you.

1448
01:42:22.434 --> 01:42:23.894
Well, who did
all of this?

1449
01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:27.940
I did, with a little help
from my friends on the nursing staff.

1450
01:42:28.106 --> 01:42:30.275
Oh...

1451
01:42:43.288 --> 01:42:46.708
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

1452
01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:48.585
Neither have I.

1453
01:42:51.547 --> 01:42:52.756
Shall we?

1454
01:43:01.431 --> 01:43:03.308
- Some grape juice?
- I'd love it.

1455
01:43:06.061 --> 01:43:08.939
Ah, so many pills.
How sick are you?

1456
01:43:09.106 --> 01:43:12.818
The sickness has become
a relative term for me.

1457
01:43:12.985 --> 01:43:17.614
I think of it now as more a general
wearing out process.

1458
01:43:19.449 --> 01:43:20.450
To you.

1459
01:43:29.626 --> 01:43:31.336
So what happened?

1460
01:43:31.503 --> 01:43:33.130
In the story,

1461
01:43:33.297 --> 01:43:35.466
which one did she choose?

1462
01:43:39.636 --> 01:43:41.013
Okay,

1463
01:43:42.931 --> 01:43:45.642
the way I see it,
I got three choices.

1464
01:43:45.809 --> 01:43:47.269
One, I can shoot him.

1465
01:43:47.436 --> 01:43:51.315
Two, I can kick
the crap out of him.

1466
01:43:51.482 --> 01:43:54.776
Or three...
I leave you.

1467
01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.452
Well, all that's no good.

1468
01:44:05.287 --> 01:44:06.997
You see, 'cause...

1469
01:44:08.707 --> 01:44:11.210
none of those options
get me you.

1470
01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:16.590
And in spite of everything,

1471
01:44:16.757 --> 01:44:18.217
I love you.

1472
01:44:21.053 --> 01:44:22.387
I love you too.

1473
01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:26.350
I meant what I said
when I gave you that ring.

1474
01:44:26.517 --> 01:44:27.726
I did too.

1475
01:44:27.893 --> 01:44:30.395
I did too.
It's just that when I'm...

1476
01:44:30.562 --> 01:44:32.564
when I'm with Noah
I feel like one person

1477
01:44:32.731 --> 01:44:36.068
and when I'm with you
I feel like someone totally different.

1478
01:44:38.278 --> 01:44:42.074
Look, it's normal
not to forget your first love.

1479
01:44:49.915 --> 01:44:52.292
I love you, Allie,

1480
01:44:52.459 --> 01:44:55.420
but I want you
for myself.

1481
01:44:55.587 --> 01:44:57.214
I don't want to have
to convince my fiance

1482
01:44:57.381 --> 01:44:59.758
that she should be
with me.

1483
01:44:59.925 --> 01:45:03.053
You don't have to.

1484
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:06.515
I already know
I should be with you.

1485
01:45:09.017 --> 01:45:10.769
And they lived happily
ever after.

1486
01:45:10.936 --> 01:45:14.523
Who? Who did?

1487
01:45:22.781 --> 01:45:25.492
Oh yes,

1488
01:45:25.659 --> 01:45:27.619
of course.

1489
01:46:09.495 --> 01:46:11.330
I remember now.

1490
01:46:12.664 --> 01:46:14.625
It was us.

1491
01:46:15.793 --> 01:46:18.003
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

1492
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:20.380
Oh my sweetheart.

1493
01:46:20.547 --> 01:46:23.509
I love you so much.

1494
01:46:25.552 --> 01:46:27.012
Oh, my baby.

1495
01:46:29.223 --> 01:46:30.933
Noah, Noah.

1496
01:46:31.099 --> 01:46:33.602
I love you, Angel.

1497
01:46:36.355 --> 01:46:38.357
- What happened to me?
- Nothing.

1498
01:46:38.524 --> 01:46:41.151
You just went away
for a little while.

1499
01:46:45.197 --> 01:46:49.284
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

1500
01:46:49.451 --> 01:46:51.787
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

1501
01:46:54.456 --> 01:46:56.542
Okay.

1502
01:46:56.708 --> 01:47:00.838

Why, yes.

1528
01:48:45.526 --> 01:48:48.362
Do you think that
I could be her tonight?

1529
01:48:50.155 --> 01:48:51.740
Would that be all right?

1530
01:48:52.783 --> 01:48:54.409
You know what we could do?

1531
01:48:54.576 --> 01:48:58.038
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

1532
01:48:58.205 --> 01:49:01.667
Why could get out of here
and just go someplace, you want to?

1533
01:49:01.834 --> 01:49:04.837
I don't think so.
Not tonight, darling.

1534
01:49:05.003 --> 01:49:07.589
Come on, why not?

1535
01:49:07.756 --> 01:49:09.758
Wait a minute...

1536
01:49:11.677 --> 01:49:15.055
why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

1537
01:49:15.222 --> 01:49:18.100
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1538
01:49:18.267 --> 01:49:20.936
- Allie... Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

1539
01:49:21.103 --> 01:49:23.522
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

1540
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:25.858
No!

1541
01:49:26.024 --> 01:49:29.027
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1542
01:49:29.194 --> 01:49:31.613
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1543
01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:33.866
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

1544
01:49:34.032 --> 01:49:35.784
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

1545

Help! Help!

1546
01:49:37.703 --> 01:49:39.538
- Help me!

No, no, not you!

1548
01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:42.249
Calm down, Allie! It's all right, sugar,
come on.

1549
01:49:42.416 --> 01:49:44.209
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right, baby. Just calm down!

1550
01:49:44.376 --> 01:49:47.588
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

1551
01:49:47.754 --> 01:49:49.590
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

1552
01:49:49.756 --> 01:49:50.716
- Help!
- Doctor!

1553
01:49:50.883 --> 01:49:52.718
Talk to me.

1554
01:49:52.885 --> 01:49:55.095
- Somebody help me!
- Calm down!

1555
01:49:55.262 --> 01:49:58.056
- Give her two cc's.
- No! No!

1556
01:49:58.223 --> 01:49:59.224
Calm down, Allie.

1557
01:49:59.391 --> 01:50:00.893
- Calm down, Allie, yes.
- One, two...

1558
01:50:01.059 --> 01:50:02.644
...three.

1559
01:50:02.811 --> 01:50:05.564
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1560
01:50:05.731 --> 01:50:07.191
Okay, now take a look.

1561
01:50:07.357 --> 01:50:09.985
Let's take a look.
One... oh, she's fine.

1562
01:50:10.152 --> 01:50:12.237
- Good. Just breathe.
- She's fine. She's fine.

1563
01:50:12.404 --> 01:50:15.073
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

1564
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.367
- Relax...
- You're going to be okay, Allie.

1565
01:50:17.534 --> 01:50:18.744
- Relax.
- Allie?

1566
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:21.413
You're fine, honey.

1567
01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:22.623

Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1579
01:51:23.433 --> 01:51:24.476
Mr. Calhoun?

1580
01:51:26.728 --> 01:51:29.106
Call Dr. Von Pettit
and USC, okay?

1581
01:51:29.273 --> 01:51:31.483
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

1582
01:51:31.650 --> 01:51:33.819
Let them know we are in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

1583
01:51:33.986 --> 01:51:36.405
Okay, will do.

1584
01:51:52.754 --> 01:51:55.507
We talked about this.

1585
01:51:55.674 --> 01:51:58.218
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

1586
01:51:58.385 --> 01:52:00.971
Okay, yes,
come on, let's go.

1587
01:52:01.138 --> 01:52:02.764
It's okay, baby,
come on.

1588
01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:05.350
You know Mr. Holmes.

1589
01:52:09.104 --> 01:52:10.939
Just try it.

1590
01:52:56.485 --> 01:52:58.195
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1591
01:52:59.613 --> 01:53:01.073
Welcome back.

1592
01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:04.868
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1593
01:53:05.035 --> 01:53:08.330
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

1594
01:53:08.497 --> 01:53:10.749
I can't sleep.

1595
01:53:10.916 --> 01:53:13.460
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

1596
01:53:13.627 --> 01:53:15.921
Yeah, I know.

1597
01:53:16.088 --> 01:53:19.174
You weren't really
going for a walk, were you?

1598
01:53:19.341 --> 01:53:21.552
You were going
to see Miss Allie.

1599
01:53:22.845 --> 01:53:25.013
I just got out
of the hospital

1600
01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.890
and I miss her.

1601
01:53:27.057 --> 01:53:28.934
Mr. Calhoun,

1602
01:53:29.101 --> 01:53:31.603
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

1603
01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:35.274
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

1604
01:53:37.276 --> 01:53:38.360
As for me,

1605
01:53:38.527 --> 01:53:40.404
I'm gonna
go downstairs

1606
01:53:40.571 --> 01:53:43.031
and get myself
a cup of coffee.

1607
01:53:43.198 --> 01:53:45.909
I won't be back
to check on you for a while,

1608
01:53:46.076 --> 01:53:48.120
so don't
do anything foolish.

1609
01:54:44.384 --> 01:54:45.886
Hi.

1610
01:54:55.187 --> 01:54:56.146
Noah.

1611
01:54:58.482 --> 01:54:59.691
Noah.

1612
01:55:02.569 --> 01:55:05.155
Hi, sweetheart.

1613
01:55:05.322 --> 01:55:08.534
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to be here to read to you.

1614
01:55:09.868 --> 01:55:12.329
I didn't know
what to do.

1615
01:55:12.496 --> 01:55:14.998
I was afraid
you were never coming back.

1616
01:55:15.165 --> 01:55:17.126
I'll always come back.

1617
01:55:22.047 --> 01:55:24.883
What's gonna happen

1618
01:55:25.050 --> 01:55:28.178
when I can't
remember anything any more?

1619
01:55:30.139 --> 01:55:31.223
What will you do?

1620
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:34.309
I'll be here.

1621
01:55:34.476 --> 01:55:36.687
I'll never leave you.

1622
01:55:45.904 --> 01:55:48.240
I need to ask
you something.

1623
01:55:48.407 --> 01:55:50.242
What is it,
sweetheart?

1624
01:55:54.746 --> 01:55:57.749
Do you think

1625
01:55:57.916 --> 01:55:59.751
that our love

1626
01:55:59.918 --> 01:56:02.045
can create miracles?

1627
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:05.424
Yes, I do.

1628
01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:10.095
That's what brings
you back to me each time.

1629
01:56:18.312 --> 01:56:21.440
Do you think our love

1630
01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:23.859
could take us
away together?

1631
01:56:30.574 --> 01:56:34.244
I think our love
can do anything we want it to.

1632
01:56:47.299 --> 01:56:50.135
I love you.

1633
01:56:50.302 --> 01:56:52.346
I love you, Allie.

1634
01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:13.617
Good night.

1635
01:57:18.539 --> 01:57:20.999
I'll be seeing you.

1636
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.753
La la la la

1637
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.505
Da da da da

1638
01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:28.799
Dum ba da
