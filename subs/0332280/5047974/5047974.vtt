1539
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:11.692
Will you tell them I love them?

1540
01:48:12.278 --> 01:48:13.939
Of course I will.

1541
01:48:15.115 --> 01:48:17.072
And that I'm sorry.

1542
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:21.242
I'll tell them, sweetheart.

1543
01:48:34.092 --> 01:48:36.675
Remember that story you were
reading to me?

1544
01:48:36.845 --> 01:48:38.586
Yes.

1545
01:48:45.437 --> 01:48:48.850
Do you think
that I could be her tonight?

1546
01:48:49.983 --> 01:48:51.815
Would that be all right?

1547
01:48:52.527 --> 01:48:54.188
You know what we could do?

1548
01:48:54.362 --> 01:48:57.946
Maybe we could get a car
and we could go for a ride.

1549
01:48:58.116 --> 01:49:01.905
We could get out of here and just
go some place, you want to?

1550
01:49:02.078 --> 01:49:05.070
I don't think so. Not tonight, darling.

1551
01:49:05.248 --> 01:49:07.489
Come on, why not?

1552
01:49:07.667 --> 01:49:09.408
Wait a minute.

1553
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:14.917
Why did you call me darling?
I don't know you.

1554
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:17.549
What's going on here?
Am I supposed to know you?

1555
01:49:17.719 --> 01:49:21.178
- Allie. Allie, sweetheart.
- No, no, no!

1556
01:49:21.347 --> 01:49:23.805
Hey, Allie, I love you,
stay with me, don't leave...

1557
01:49:23.975 --> 01:49:25.465
No!

1558
01:49:25.852 --> 01:49:29.265
- Who are you?
- I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.

1559
01:49:29.439 --> 01:49:31.851
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

1560
01:49:32.025 --> 01:49:33.891
- Come on, baby.
- Don't come near me!

1561
01:49:34.069 --> 01:49:35.810
- Don't you come near me!
- Allie... Allie, I...

1562
01:49:35.987 --> 01:49:37.773
Help! Help!

1563
01:49:37.947 --> 01:49:39.813
- Help me!
- Calm down, Allie, calm down.

1564
01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:42.198
- No, not you!
- Calm down, Allie! It's all right, come on.

1565
01:49:42.368 --> 01:49:44.029
- No! Let me go!
- It's all right. Calm down.

1566
01:49:44.204 --> 01:49:47.822
- No! Leave me alone.
- Calm down, Allie, it's all right.

1567
01:49:47.999 --> 01:49:49.455
- Somebody help me!
- Now calm down.

1568
01:49:49.626 --> 01:49:50.991
- Help!
- Doctor!

1569
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:53.035
- Talk to me.
NURSE: She's sundowning.

1570
01:49:53.213 --> 01:49:55.580

NURSE: Calm down!

1571
01:49:55.757 --> 01:49:58.249

[SCREAMS]

1575
01:50:02.847 --> 01:50:05.509
- Allie, it's all right. It's all right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1576
01:50:05.683 --> 01:50:07.424
Okay, now take a look.

1577
01:50:07.602 --> 01:50:09.934
Let's take a look. One. Oh, she's fine.

1578
01:50:10.105 --> 01:50:12.517
- Good. Just breathe. Shh.
- She's fine. She's fine.

1579
01:50:12.690 --> 01:50:15.148
Stay calm, just breathe
in and out, come on.

1580
01:50:15.318 --> 01:50:17.400
NURSE: Relax.
DOCTOR: You're gonna be okay, Allie.

1581
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:19.026
NURSE: Relax.
DOCTOR: Allie?

1582
01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:21.188
You're fine, honey.

1583
01:50:21.366 --> 01:50:22.697
Shh.

1584
01:51:20.008 --> 01:51:22.249
NURSE:
Morning, Mr. Calhoun.

1585
01:51:23.386 --> 01:51:25.252
Mr. Calhoun?

1586
01:51:26.639 --> 01:51:28.755
Call Dr. Von Pettit, MUSC, okay?

1587
01:51:28.933 --> 01:51:31.425
I've got no BP, I got no pulse.
I've got nothing.

1588
01:51:31.603 --> 01:51:33.765
Let them know we're in full arrest.
Call me on my cell.

1589
01:51:33.938 --> 01:51:35.770
NURSE:
Okay, will do.

1590
01:51:52.999 --> 01:51:55.331
We talked about this.

1591
01:51:55.501 --> 01:51:58.209
It's all right now.
Come on, come on, precious.

1592
01:51:58.379 --> 01:52:00.290
Okay, yes, come on, let's go.

1593
01:52:00.465 --> 01:52:02.627
It's okay, baby, come on.

1594
01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.167
You know Mr. Holmes.

1595
01:52:08.973 --> 01:52:10.839
NURSE:
Just try it.

1596
01:52:56.521 --> 01:52:58.853
Oh, Mr. Calhoun.

1597
01:52:59.524 --> 01:53:00.935
Welcome back.

1598
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:05.103
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle.

1599
01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:08.363
- Where you going?
- I was just taking a walk.

1600
01:53:08.533 --> 01:53:10.570
I can't sleep.

1601
01:53:10.743 --> 01:53:13.405
Well, you know you're not supposed to,
it's against the rules.

1602
01:53:13.579 --> 01:53:15.240
Yeah, I know.

1603
01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.953
You weren't really going
for a walk, were you?

1604
01:53:19.127 --> 01:53:21.619
You were going to see Miss Allie.

1605
01:53:22.714 --> 01:53:24.876
I just got out of the hospital.

1606
01:53:25.049 --> 01:53:26.790
And I miss her.

1607
01:53:26.968 --> 01:53:28.709
Mr. Calhoun.

1608
01:53:28.886 --> 01:53:31.878
I'm sorry, but I can't
let you see her tonight.

1609
01:53:32.056 --> 01:53:34.923
Now you're gonna have
to go back to your room.

1610
01:53:37.186 --> 01:53:38.597
As for me...

1611
01:53:39.355 --> 01:53:42.848
...I'm gonna go downstairs
and get myself a cup of coffee.

1612
01:53:43.026 --> 01:53:46.144
I won't be back to check on you
for a while.

1613
01:53:46.321 --> 01:53:48.904
So don't do anything foolish.

1614
01:54:44.295 --> 01:54:45.751
Hi.

1615
01:54:55.223 --> 01:54:56.258
Noah.

1616
01:54:58.226 --> 01:55:00.012
Noah.

1617
01:55:02.438 --> 01:55:04.429
Hi, sweetheart.

1618
01:55:05.233 --> 01:55:08.817
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to be here to read to you.

1619
01:55:09.654 --> 01:55:12.146
I didn't know what to do.

1620
01:55:12.323 --> 01:55:14.610
I was afraid you were never coming back.

1621
01:55:14.784 --> 01:55:17.196
I'll always come back.

1622
01:55:21.833 --> 01:55:24.165
What's gonna happen...

1623
01:55:24.919 --> 01:55:28.833
...when I can't remember
anything anymore?

1624
01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:31.463
What will you do?

1625
01:55:31.634 --> 01:55:34.126
Oh, I'll be here.

1626
01:55:34.303 --> 01:55:36.419
I'll never leave you.

1627
01:55:45.773 --> 01:55:48.060
I need to ask you something.

1628
01:55:48.234 --> 01:55:50.475
What is it, sweetheart?

1629
01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:56.531
Do you think...

1630
01:55:57.702 --> 01:55:59.613
...that our love...

1631
01:55:59.787 --> 01:56:02.119
...can create miracles?

1632
01:56:03.416 --> 01:56:05.248
Yes, I do.

1633
01:56:06.711 --> 01:56:10.670
That's what brings you back
to me each time.

1634
01:56:18.347 --> 01:56:20.509
Do you think our love...

1635
01:56:21.601 --> 01:56:23.888
...could take us away together?

1636
01:56:30.401 --> 01:56:34.360
I think our love can do
anything we want it to.

1637
01:56:47.043 --> 01:56:48.909
I love you.

1638
01:56:50.087 --> 01:56:52.294
I love you, Allie.

1639
01:57:09.065 --> 01:57:10.726
Good night.

1640
01:57:11.484 --> 01:57:13.100
Good night.

1641
01:57:18.449 --> 01:57:20.531
I'll be seeing you.
