00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.452
<i>The once-great city of New York becomes
the one maximum-security prison</i>

2
00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:29.660
<i>for the entire country.</i>

3
00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:33.702
<i>A 50-foot containment wall is erected
along the New Jersey shoreline,</i>

4
00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:37.619
<i>across the Harlem River
and down along the Brooklyn shoreline.</i>

5
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.993
<i>It completely surrounds Manhattan Island.</i>

6
00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:44.619
<i>All bridges and waterways are mined.</i>

7
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.619
<i>The United States Police Force,
like an army, is encamped around the island.</i>

8
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:57.285
<i>There are no guards inside the prison,
only prisoners and the worlds they have made.</i>

9
00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:00.993
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

10
00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.744
<i>Once you go in, you don't come out.</i>

11
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.160
<i>This is Gotham 4, north bay, station 17.</i>

12
00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:37.859
<i>I have an escape in progress,
object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.</i>

13
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.076
<i>You have 10 seconds. Turn around.
Start back to the island.</i>

14
00:06:39.577 --> 00:06:41.452
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

15
00:06:41.577 --> 00:06:43.535
<i>Circle to base, over.</i>

16
00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:46.826
Security, this is Rehme,
we have confirmation from Gotham 4.

17
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.826
We have a kill at mid-harbor south
of the Battery. Two in the water dead.

18
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.243
<i>Two confirmed.</i>

19
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.785
Very well.

20
00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:01.535
Air traffic, this is Rehme.

21
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.993
<i>Attention, you are now
entering the debarkation area.</i>

22
00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:34.744
<i>No talking, no smoking. Follow
the orange line to the processing area.</i>

23
00:08:34.826 --> 00:08:38.493
<i>The next scheduled departure
to the prison is in two hours.</i>

24
00:08:38.577 --> 00:08:42.452
<i>You now have the option to terminate
and be cremated on the premises.</i>

25
00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:47.035
<i>If you elect this option, notify the duty
sergeant in your processing area.</i>

26
00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:54.493
Hold it.

27
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.577
We got a small jet in trouble
over restricted airspace.

28
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.951
Where is it?

29
00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:26.744
Seven miles out and closing.

30
00:09:41.202 --> 00:09:42.910
Been on the horn for the past 20 minutes.

31
00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:44.702
We haven't been able to reach him.

32
00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:46.868
There was a transmission 10 minutes ago.

33
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:50.577
He identified as David 14,
then all of a sudden he was cut off.

34
00:09:50.744 --> 00:09:52.744
David 14, acknowledge.

35
00:09:53.452 --> 00:09:56.243
David 14, I'm calling air rescue.

36
00:09:56.327 --> 00:10:02.076
Squawk 7700, contact on 121.5.

37
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.494
There's still no reply.

38
00:10:05.118 --> 00:10:08.285
Bayonne, I have
a mayday in restricted space.

39
00:10:08.368 --> 00:10:09.410
<i>New York, I have him.</i>

40
00:10:09.493 --> 00:10:10.494
Who is he?

41
00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.076
I don't know.

42
00:10:12.452 --> 00:10:13.535
You have the code?

43
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:15.744
There's no David 14 on the computer.

44
00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:17.368
- Unlisted?
- Unregistered code.

45
00:10:17.452 --> 00:10:19.993
We telexed Washington.
Still waiting for a reply.

46
00:10:20.076 --> 00:10:21.993
I think I got him, sir.

47
00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:27.619
<i>It's too late, assholes.</i>

48
00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:32.076
<i>All your imperialist weapons
and lies can't save him now.</i>

49
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.868
<i>We're going down. We're going to crash!</i>

50
00:10:35.993 --> 00:10:38.410
David 14, acknowledge.

51
00:10:38.693 --> 00:10:40.667
Codes coming in, sir.

52
00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:08.285
Tell this to the workers
when they ask where your leader went.

53
00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:13.660
We, the soldiers of the National
Liberation Front of America,

54
00:11:13.826 --> 00:11:16.702
in the name of the workers and all

55
00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:19.660
the oppressed of this imperialist country

56
00:11:19.744 --> 00:11:24.493
have struck a fatal blow
to the racist police state.

57
00:11:24.577 --> 00:11:28.577
<i>What better revolutionary example
than to let their president perish</i>

58
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.452
<i>in the inhuman dungeon
of his own imperialist prison?</i>

59
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.535
<i>The bosses of the racist...</i>

60
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.535
Unlock the pod.

61
00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:38.744
She's bolted the door.

62
00:11:38.868 --> 00:11:40.285
Can't you shoot off the lock?

63
00:11:40.368 --> 00:11:41.868
No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

64
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.160
How about lifting the door off at the hinges?

65
00:11:44.243 --> 00:11:45.535
No, sir.

66
00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.744
Get me to the pod.

67
00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:06.660
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you
if you become separated from the pod.

68
00:12:06.744 --> 00:12:08.660
I'm activating it now.

69
00:12:15.744 --> 00:12:18.868
God save me and watch over you all.

70
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.118
<i>Computer simulation.</i>

71
00:12:29.243 --> 00:12:30.951
<i>Tracking</i> Air Force One.

72
00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:41.327
He's down!

73
00:12:41.452 --> 00:12:43.459
It's the escape pod.

74
00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:49.368
Forty degrees.

75
00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:52.826
Fifty yards from impact.

76
00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:55.535
I'm going in.

77
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:42.035
<i>1-W-Larry.</i>

78
00:13:42.118 --> 00:13:43.826
<i>Over the Battery.</i>

79
00:13:45.202 --> 00:13:46.910
<i>We're moving down.</i>

80
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.243
<i>Crash site ahead.</i>

81
00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.868
You touch me, he dies.

82
00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:02.826
If you're not in the air
in 30 seconds, he dies.

83
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.993
You come back in, he dies.

84
00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:12.410
Twenty seconds.

85
00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:15.285
I'm ready to talk.

86
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.452
19, 18...

87
00:16:17.702 --> 00:16:19.577
What do you want?

88
00:16:19.744 --> 00:16:21.660
...17, 16...

89
00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:23.494
Let's go. Let's go!

90
00:16:52.243 --> 00:16:55.076
Yes. He's right here, Mr. Vice President.

91
00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:59.702
This is Bob Hauk.

92
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.285
We can't. If we move in
with choppers, they'll kill him.

93
00:17:04.368 --> 00:17:06.993
We're lucky if he's not dead already.

94
00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:08.993
They don't want anything yet.

95
00:17:09.076 --> 00:17:11.327
By the time they figure out
what they want, it'll be too late.

96
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.910
Tell him we have to go with your plan. Now.

97
00:17:14.577 --> 00:17:16.993
We can't wait till tomorrow.
If we have to move in and take the island,

98
00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:19.744
it's a last resort. It's 8:45.

99
00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:21.285
I want permission to try a rescue.

100
00:17:23.035 --> 00:17:24.410
Thank you.

101
00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:33.035
All right.

102
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.410
He's dangerous, sir.

103
00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:36.118
I know. I'll be okay.

104
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.785
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

105
00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:00.410
Call me Snake.

106
00:18:05.076 --> 00:18:08.035
"S.D. Plissken, American.

107
00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:11.619
"Lieutenant, Special Forces unit Black Light.

108
00:18:11.702 --> 00:18:14.118
"Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.

109
00:18:14.202 --> 00:18:17.285
"Youngest man to be decorated
by the President."

110
00:18:18.327 --> 00:18:20.452
You robbed the Federal Reserve depository.

111
00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.993
"Life sentence, New York
Maximum Security Penitentiary."

112
00:18:24.285 --> 00:18:27.744
I'm ready to kick your ass
out of the world, war hero.

113
00:18:42.702 --> 00:18:44.076
Who are you?

114
00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:45.577
Hauk.

115
00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.243
Police commissioner.

116
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.993
Bob Hauk.

117
00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:53.035
Special Forces unit Texas Thunder.

118
00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:55.160
We heard of you, too, Plissken.

119
00:18:55.243 --> 00:18:56.951
Why are we talking?

120
00:18:57.076 --> 00:18:58.826
I have a deal for you.

121
00:19:00.202 --> 00:19:04.744
You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
action you committed in the United States.

122
00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:06.368
There was an accident.

123
00:19:06.452 --> 00:19:09.785
About an hour ago, a small jet
went down inside New York City.

124
00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:12.076
The President was on board.

125
00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:16.868
- President of what?
- That's not funny, Plissken.

126
00:19:17.202 --> 00:19:21.830
You go in, find the President, bring him
out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.

127
00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.619
- Twenty-four hours?
- I'm making you an offer.

128
00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.910
- Bullshit.
- Straight. Just like I said.

129
00:19:26.993 --> 00:19:30.168
- I'll think about it.
- No time. Give me an answer.

130
00:19:30.327 --> 00:19:32.285
Get a new president.

131
00:19:32.368 --> 00:19:35.410
We're still at war, Plissken.
We need him alive.

132
00:19:35.577 --> 00:19:39.868
I don't give a fuck about
your war or your president.

133
00:19:41.452 --> 00:19:43.660
- Is that your answer?
- I'm thinking about it.

134
00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:45.118
Think hard.

135
00:19:53.368 --> 00:19:56.580
- Why me?
- You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.

136
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.910
You know how to get in quiet.
You're all I've got.

137
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.826
I guess I go in, one way or the other.

138
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.493
Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me the paper.

139
00:20:07.577 --> 00:20:09.993
- When you come out.
- Before.

140
00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:13.202
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

141
00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:15.026
Call me Snake.

142
00:20:16.702 --> 00:20:18.118
Some of them have cars.

143
00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:21.744
They took old junkers that were left behind,
converted them to steam.

144
00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:24.368
We think they may also have
a gasoline source in there.

145
00:20:24.452 --> 00:20:28.744
And power. Greenhouses, rigged-up generators,
some areas have streetlights.

146
00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:32.493
The "crazies," they live in the subways.

147
00:20:32.577 --> 00:20:36.368
Complete control of the underground.
They're night raiders.

148
00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:40.327
Tracer. Sends a radio signal for 15 minutes.

149
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.826
If you push it, we can track you on radar.

150
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.868
Just like Leningrad.

151
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.842
But they added something. A safety catch.

152
00:20:57.493 --> 00:20:58.826
Where am I landing?

153
00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:01.493
Top of the World Trade Center.
Only place you can land.

154
00:21:01.577 --> 00:21:05.118
They won't see it and you
can take off from a free fall.

155
00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:07.993
On the roof is a service elevator.

156
00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:12.118
It's still operational.
We use it to infiltrate the prison.

157
00:21:12.202 --> 00:21:15.785
There's a power box.
It'll activate the elevator down to 50.

158
00:21:15.868 --> 00:21:18.410
From there on down, you walk.

159
00:21:18.494 --> 00:21:21.785
You can locate the President
by his vital-signs bracelet on his wrist.

160
00:21:21.868 --> 00:21:24.868
Sends off a sync pulse. Use this.

161
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:29.076
Homing device.
Shows direction and distance.

162
00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:36.660
Strong antitoxin, stops bacteria
and viral growth for 24 hours.

163
00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:46.285
- Take off your jacket.
- I'll be all right.

164
00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:48.318
Let's go, Plissken.

165
00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:53.368
I don't like needles.

166
00:22:00.494 --> 00:22:03.202
22 hours, 59 minutes, 57 seconds.

167
00:22:03.285 --> 00:22:04.951
We talked about 24.

168
00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:09.202
In 22 hours,
the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.

169
00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:12.118
China and the Soviet
Union will go back home.

170
00:22:12.202 --> 00:22:15.668
Now, the President was on his way
to the summit when his plane went down.

171
00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:18.826
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.

172
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.160
The tape recording inside
has to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

173
00:22:23.243 --> 00:22:24.744
What's on it?

174
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.243
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

175
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.243
All right.

176
00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:31.619
It's the survival
of the human race, Plissken.

177
00:22:31.702 --> 00:22:34.368
Something you don't give a shit about.

178
00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:42.744
I'm going to inject you.
It'll sting for a second or two.

179
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.243
That's it, Plissken.

180
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.702
Tell him.

181
00:23:04.744 --> 00:23:06.643
Tell me what?

182
00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:10.160
That idea you had about turning
the Gullfire around 180 degrees

183
00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:12.826
and flying off to Canada...

184
00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:15.910
What did you do to me, asshole?

185
00:23:16.202 --> 00:23:19.660
My idea, Plissken.
Something we've been fooling around with.

186
00:23:19.744 --> 00:23:22.577
Two microscopic capsules
lodged in your arteries.

187
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.285
They're already starting to dissolve.

188
00:23:25.368 --> 00:23:28.452
In 22 hours,
the cores will completely dissolve.

189
00:23:28.535 --> 00:23:32.035
Inside the cores are a heat-sensing charge.

190
00:23:32.118 --> 00:23:34.076
Not a large explosive.

191
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.535
About the size of a pinhead.

192
00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:40.285
Just big enough
to open up both your arteries.

193
00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:42.160
I'd say you'd be dead in 10 or 15 seconds...

194
00:23:42.285 --> 00:23:45.660
- Take them out now.
- They're protected by the cores.

195
00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:50.452
15 minutes before the last hour's up,
we can neutralize the charge with x-rays.

196
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:01.160
We'll burn out the charges
if you have the President.

197
00:24:01.243 --> 00:24:03.160
What if I'm a little late?

198
00:24:03.285 --> 00:24:07.410
No more Hartford Summit
and no more Snake Plissken.

199
00:24:10.452 --> 00:24:13.035
When I get back, I'm gonna kill you.

200
00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.777
The Gullfire's waiting.

201
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.785
- I'm ready.
- Twenty-one hours.

202
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.826
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.

203
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.410
If I come back without him,
you'll burn these things out?

204
00:25:15.493 --> 00:25:17.744
Get them both back, Plissken.

205
00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:20.826
<i>And, remember,
once you're inside you're on your own.</i>

206
00:25:21.076 --> 00:25:22.829
Oh, you mean I can't count on you?

207
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:25.268
- <i>No.</i>
- Good.

208
00:25:51.702 --> 00:25:55.910
<i>Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours,
17 minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

209
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.243
Are you picking up the target blip?

210
00:26:18.993 --> 00:26:20.577
Right on course.

211
00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:45.035
Been a while.

212
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.202
<i>How's your altitude?</i>

213
00:26:56.035 --> 00:26:59.202
Plissken. Plissken?

214
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.076
- Plissken, what are you doing?
- Playing with myself. I'm going in.

215
00:27:55.535 --> 00:27:56.826
Plissken.

216
00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:59.368
Plissken?

217
00:28:54.744 --> 00:28:58.535
<i>I'm inside the World Trade Center
on the 50th floor.</i>

218
00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:00.327
<i>Just like Leningrad, Hauk.</i>

219
00:29:00.452 --> 00:29:04.785
- Is the glider intact?
- Yeah, but taking off is for shit.

220
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.744
- I'll work it out.
- <i>You'll have to use the east stairwell.</i>

221
00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:10.577
<i>It's gonna take you a little while
to get to ground level.</i>

222
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.910
<i>Call me when you get outside.</i>

223
00:31:13.452 --> 00:31:15.118
I'm at the plane.

224
00:31:16.243 --> 00:31:18.560
Nobody else made it, Hauk.

225
00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:20.285
Wait a minute.

226
00:31:24.327 --> 00:31:26.076
I've got his pulse.

227
00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:30.285
Right up ahead, moving northwest.

228
00:32:57.535 --> 00:33:00.452
<i>...the Big Apple is plenty of fun</i>

229
00:33:00.535 --> 00:33:04.327
<i>Stab a priest with a fork</i>

230
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.993
<i>And you'll spend your vacation in New York</i>

231
00:33:10.076 --> 00:33:13.327
<i>Rob a bank, take a truck</i>

232
00:33:13.577 --> 00:33:17.035
<i>You can get here by stealing a buck</i>

233
00:33:17.577 --> 00:33:21.285
<i>This is bliss, it's a lark</i>

234
00:33:21.368 --> 00:33:26.744
<i>Buddy, everyone's coming to New York!</i>

235
00:33:27.285 --> 00:33:33.702
<i>No more Yankees Strike
the word from your ears</i>

236
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:41.619
<i>Spin the roulette
There's no more opera at the Met</i>

237
00:33:41.702 --> 00:33:45.243
<i>This is hell, this is fate</i>

238
00:33:45.494 --> 00:33:49.160
<i>But now this is your world and it's great</i>

239
00:33:49.243 --> 00:33:53.076
<i>So rejoice, pop a cork</i>

240
00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:58.327
<i>Buddy, everyone's coming to New York!</i>

241
00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.452
<i>To the cop...</i>

242
00:34:15.868 --> 00:34:19.493
Hey. You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

243
00:34:21.577 --> 00:34:23.076
What do you want?

244
00:34:23.202 --> 00:34:24.702
Nothing.

245
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.910
I thought you were dead.

246
00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:35.619
Hey, you don't wanna walk
around down there, Snake.

247
00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:34.868
Hi, chief. Nice night.

248
00:35:37.577 --> 00:35:39.535
Nice boots.

249
00:35:39.619 --> 00:35:40.868
Nice boots.

250
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:42.376
Hey.

251
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.035
Easy now, chief.

252
00:35:50.118 --> 00:35:53.093
I'm walking. I'm walking.

253
00:36:20.452 --> 00:36:21.993
Mr. President.

254
00:36:23.076 --> 00:36:26.785
I'm the President. Sure, I'm the President.

255
00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:30.577
I knew when I got this thing,
I'd be President.

256
00:36:35.076 --> 00:36:36.826
Where'd you get it?

257
00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:38.660
I woke up and there it was.

258
00:36:38.744 --> 00:36:40.868
It was like a miracle.

259
00:36:46.035 --> 00:36:48.035
Oh, Jesus!

260
00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.619
It may be just an impact
on the mechanism itself.

261
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.493
Hauk.

262
00:36:55.785 --> 00:36:56.993
I'm right here, Plissken.

263
00:36:57.076 --> 00:37:01.118
<i>I don't know who you assholes
are looking at, but it's not the President.</i>

264
00:37:02.818 --> 00:37:06.234
<i>Hail to the chief</i>

265
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.452
All right, get your machine ready.
I'm coming out.

266
00:37:11.035 --> 00:37:14.577
- Eighteen hours, Plissken.
- Listen to me, Hauk.

267
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.577
The President is dead. You got that?
Somebody's had him for dinner.

268
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.619
Plissken, if you get back in that glider,
I'll shoot you down.

269
00:37:21.702 --> 00:37:24.327
You climb out, I'll burn you off the wall.

270
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.484
<i>You understand that, Plissken?</i>

271
00:37:30.577 --> 00:37:32.619
A little human compassion.

272
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.243
You a cop?

273
00:40:51.868 --> 00:40:52.910
No.

274
00:40:53.452 --> 00:40:54.993
You got a gun.

275
00:40:57.826 --> 00:40:59.452
You got a smoke?

276
00:41:08.868 --> 00:41:10.910
Keep your hand over it.

277
00:41:10.993 --> 00:41:13.702
It's all right if we're quiet.
They won't hear us.

278
00:41:15.744 --> 00:41:19.951
- Hey, this is a real one. You just get in?
- What's going on out there?

279
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.285
Crazies.

280
00:41:22.368 --> 00:41:24.744
End of the month. They're out of food.

281
00:41:26.243 --> 00:41:28.160
Do you live here?

282
00:41:28.744 --> 00:41:30.951
Skulls? Are you kidding?

283
00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:32.702
I'm with the Turks now.

284
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.452
I just got caught on the street after dark,
now I'm stuck here all night.

285
00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:38.785
A plane crashed seven hours ago
near 8th Avenue. Did you see it?

286
00:41:39.577 --> 00:41:40.619
No.

287
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.535
Shit.

288
00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:47.910
You're a cop.

289
00:41:48.035 --> 00:41:49.327
I'm an asshole.

290
00:41:52.868 --> 00:41:54.744
Hey, wait a minute.

291
00:41:55.243 --> 00:41:56.993
I know who you are.

292
00:41:58.035 --> 00:41:59.744
Yeah. But I heard you were dead.

293
00:41:59.868 --> 00:42:01.577
I am.

294
00:42:02.577 --> 00:42:05.410
Snake Plissken. All right!

295
00:42:05.577 --> 00:42:07.327
What you doing in here with a gun, Snake?

296
00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.702
Looking for somebody.

297
00:42:09.785 --> 00:42:12.118
- Who?
- The President.

298
00:42:12.202 --> 00:42:13.993
Come on.

299
00:42:14.076 --> 00:42:15.285
He really here?

300
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.619
Somewhere.

301
00:42:21.118 --> 00:42:24.744
When you find him, you gonna take him out?

302
00:42:24.826 --> 00:42:26.076
Mmm-hmm.

303
00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:31.202
Take me out with you, Snake.

304
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.493
Why?

305
00:42:34.368 --> 00:42:36.926
I can think of lots of reasons why.

306
00:44:38.243 --> 00:44:40.160
Where you going, buddy?

307
00:44:48.744 --> 00:44:49.951
Bad neighborhood, Snake.

308
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:53.210
You don't wanna be walking
from the Bowery to 42nd Street at night.

309
00:44:53.293 --> 00:44:55.118
I've been driving a cab here for 30 years,

310
00:44:55.202 --> 00:44:59.243
and I'm telling you, you don't walk
around here at night. Yes, sir!

311
00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.410
Here they'll kill you and strip you
in 10 seconds flat.

312
00:45:02.493 --> 00:45:07.243
Usually, I'm not down around here myself,
but I wanted to catch that show.

313
00:45:07.493 --> 00:45:10.619
This stuff is like gold
around here, you know.

314
00:45:17.368 --> 00:45:19.452
Hey, Snake, when did you get in?

315
00:45:19.577 --> 00:45:21.744
I didn't even know they caught you.

316
00:45:21.951 --> 00:45:25.951
Oh, Snake Plissken in my cab.

317
00:45:26.035 --> 00:45:29.493
Wait till I tell Eddie! Hey, hang on, Snake.

318
00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:41.744
Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?

319
00:45:41.826 --> 00:45:43.243
Looking for somebody.

320
00:45:43.327 --> 00:45:47.076
Well, why didn't you ask me?
Hell, I know everybody in this town.

321
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.910
Yes, sir, I've been driving this cab
for 30 years. This very same cab!

322
00:45:50.993 --> 00:45:52.993
I'm gonna ask you.

323
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.160
- Now, where's the President?
- The Duke got him.

324
00:45:57.243 --> 00:45:59.285
Everybody knows the Duke's got him.

325
00:45:59.368 --> 00:46:01.826
You don't have to put a gun
to my head. I'll tell you.

326
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.076
- Who's the Duke?
- The Duke?

327
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.660
The Duke of New York. A-number-one.
The big man, that's who!

328
00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:09.618
Well, that's real good.

329
00:46:11.494 --> 00:46:13.076
I wanna meet this Duke.

330
00:46:13.202 --> 00:46:16.243
You can't meet the Duke. Are you crazy?

331
00:46:16.368 --> 00:46:20.494
Nobody gets to meet the Duke.
You meet him once and then you're dead!

332
00:46:45.535 --> 00:46:47.951
I hate to leave her on the street.

333
00:46:49.368 --> 00:46:52.076
Usually, I don't leave her alone at all.

334
00:46:55.285 --> 00:46:57.702
But you're a special case, Snake.

335
00:47:24.118 --> 00:47:25.243
It's okay, Snake.

336
00:47:25.368 --> 00:47:28.035
It's a better neighborhood. You can relax.

337
00:47:31.202 --> 00:47:32.910
Thanks.

338
00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:36.160
Boy, they got a great place here.
Like a fortress.

339
00:47:36.243 --> 00:47:37.826
- They?
- Yeah.

340
00:47:38.076 --> 00:47:40.660
- Who is it?
- It's me!

341
00:47:40.744 --> 00:47:43.702
- Who's "me"?
- Cabbie.

342
00:47:43.993 --> 00:47:45.951
What do you want?

343
00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.243
Somebody wants to see Brain. It's important.

344
00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:50.485
- Go away, Cabbie!
- No, it's Snake!

345
00:47:51.243 --> 00:47:53.284
Snake Plissken.

346
00:48:03.577 --> 00:48:04.868
You're Plissken?

347
00:48:04.993 --> 00:48:06.327
He wants to see Brain.

348
00:48:08.202 --> 00:48:09.285
Why?

349
00:48:17.702 --> 00:48:19.577
I wanna meet the Duke.

350
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:41.875
Hey, you remember this place, Snake.
It used to be a public library.

351
00:48:41.959 --> 00:48:44.118
Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest.

352
00:48:44.202 --> 00:48:46.826
Mr. Fabulous! The Duke loves him.

353
00:48:49.076 --> 00:48:50.868
Who's that?

354
00:48:50.993 --> 00:48:52.785
That's Maggie, Brain's squeeze.

355
00:48:53.993 --> 00:48:57.159
The Duke gave her to Brain
just to keep him happy.

356
00:48:57.243 --> 00:48:59.310
See what I mean?

357
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.452
Heard you were dead.

358
00:49:10.951 --> 00:49:14.868
Brain? Brain,
I brought somebody to see you.

359
00:49:18.076 --> 00:49:19.619
Harold Helman.

360
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.494
Snake?

361
00:49:24.577 --> 00:49:25.577
Harold?

362
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.493
How you been, Harold?

363
00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.202
It's been a long time.

364
00:49:30.285 --> 00:49:32.577
You never told me you knew
Snake Plissken, Brain.

365
00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:37.243
Isn't that great? Hey, Brain, I could use
some gas if you could spare some.

366
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.202
I'm glad you remember me.

367
00:49:42.702 --> 00:49:44.243
Yeah.

368
00:49:44.327 --> 00:49:46.660
A man should remember his past.

369
00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.243
Kansas City, four years ago,
you ran out on me.

370
00:49:51.243 --> 00:49:52.910
You left me sitting there.

371
00:49:53.035 --> 00:49:54.660
You were late.

372
00:49:54.744 --> 00:49:57.160
We were buddies, Harold.

373
00:49:57.243 --> 00:49:58.993
You, me and Fresno Bob.

374
00:49:59.118 --> 00:50:00.910
You know what they did to Bob?

375
00:50:01.285 --> 00:50:02.410
Hmm?

376
00:50:05.619 --> 00:50:07.535
You wanna see him sprayed
all over that map, baby?

377
00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:10.494
- Where's the President?
- I swear to God, Snake, I don't know!

378
00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:12.410
Don't fuck with me.

379
00:50:13.535 --> 00:50:16.076
- Why do you wanna know?
- I want him.

380
00:50:16.785 --> 00:50:19.910
- Working for the man now, huh?
- I'll just beat it out of your squeeze.

381
00:50:19.993 --> 00:50:22.243
Mmm-hmm. Maggie doesn't know
exactly where he is

382
00:50:22.327 --> 00:50:26.951
and unless you know exactly, precisely
where he is, you'll never find him.

383
00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:38.826
Listen, I'll take you out of here. Yeah.

384
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:42.368
Jet glider just a couple of blocks
down the street.

385
00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:46.243
And all you gotta do is get me to him.

386
00:50:46.327 --> 00:50:48.702
No kidding? On the level?

387
00:50:48.785 --> 00:50:51.076
Hey, will you take me, too?

388
00:50:52.327 --> 00:50:54.351
We got a deal somewhere else.

389
00:50:54.744 --> 00:50:55.744
No glider.

390
00:50:56.368 --> 00:51:00.327
We've got the President and the Duke's
taking everybody out of here.

391
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.160
Never happen, baby.

392
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.744
You see, I know something
you and the Duke don't know.

393
00:51:07.243 --> 00:51:10.744
Only got so long before Mr. President
doesn't mean a whole lot.

394
00:51:11.285 --> 00:51:13.160
You're lying.

395
00:51:13.868 --> 00:51:15.744
Maybe he's not.

396
00:51:16.368 --> 00:51:19.035
I know him. Look at his face, he's lying!

397
00:51:19.118 --> 00:51:21.160
Right, Harold. I'm lying.

398
00:51:22.493 --> 00:51:25.327
So I might as well have some fun
and keep looking by myself.

399
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.160
- Brain.
- Talk to him, baby.

400
00:51:27.243 --> 00:51:29.826
- He'll kill us both if you don't tell him!
- Brain, you gotta tell him!

401
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.744
All right, all right!

402
00:51:35.285 --> 00:51:38.126
You always were smart, Harold.

403
00:51:38.619 --> 00:51:40.785
Just one thing right now.

404
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.118
Don't call me Harold.

405
00:51:47.577 --> 00:51:51.202
So you work for this Duke, huh?

406
00:51:51.368 --> 00:51:56.910
Yeah. I make gas for him,
figure out things for him.

407
00:51:57.118 --> 00:51:58.493
Like what?

408
00:51:59.118 --> 00:52:01.118
Like how to get across
the 69th Street Bridge.

409
00:52:01.202 --> 00:52:03.826
It's mined, but I know where they're planted.

410
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:07.452
We got a diagram from a guy
that got all the way across

411
00:52:07.577 --> 00:52:09.711
- before they shot the poor bastard.
- Mmm-hmm.

412
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.285
We got a crew up there now
clearing away the first barricade.

413
00:52:12.368 --> 00:52:14.410
Oh, what a sight, Snake!

414
00:52:14.493 --> 00:52:18.494
The whole camp rolling right across the
bridge and the President right out in front.

415
00:52:18.577 --> 00:52:21.618
Oh, that would have been so fine.

416
00:52:22.035 --> 00:52:23.327
Yeah, it would've been.

417
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:26.118
Yeah, well, we're going with Snake now.

418
00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:30.035
That's the Duke.

419
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.702
I know the sound of his engines.

420
00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:38.444
Don't cross the Duke. Everybody knows that.

421
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.993
Cabbie, you slime!

422
00:52:54.785 --> 00:52:57.368
No, Brain. Get out of here.

423
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.076
- He's looking for you, Brain.
- What does he want?

424
00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.118
He wants my diagram of the bridge.

425
00:54:09.202 --> 00:54:11.452
When he finds out I'm with you,
he's gonna want my life.

426
00:54:11.535 --> 00:54:12.826
Shit, Plissken,
I knew I shouldn't have listened...

427
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.160
We gotta get to the President now
while he's busy.

428
00:54:15.243 --> 00:54:18.452
Forget it. He's on the other side of town
and we got no wheels. The deal is off.

429
00:54:18.535 --> 00:54:20.076
Just calm down.

430
00:55:23.993 --> 00:55:27.076
I think they saw us.
Turn left. Turn left here.

431
00:55:35.285 --> 00:55:36.494
Brain, this is Broadway.

432
00:55:36.577 --> 00:55:39.176
I know. I know. The Duke'll take 7th Avenue.
Broadway's got five minutes...

433
00:55:39.385 --> 00:55:42.368
- No!
- Yes. Keep driving.

434
00:55:43.243 --> 00:55:45.035
What's wrong with Broadway?

435
00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:56.452
Come on, sweetheart.

436
00:56:05.744 --> 00:56:07.410
Come on, Brain.

437
00:56:41.035 --> 00:56:42.243
Maggie!

438
00:57:08.868 --> 00:57:10.118
Hold on.

439
00:57:42.744 --> 00:57:46.327
He's in the third car
from the end by the last campfire.

440
00:57:54.535 --> 00:57:56.243
It's all right.
He's gotta go in the front way.

441
00:57:56.368 --> 00:57:58.035
It'll take him five minutes.

442
00:57:58.118 --> 00:58:00.619
If you're not back to the car
in four minutes, you're on your own.

443
00:58:00.702 --> 00:58:03.910
When we get there, Harold,
you just keep talking.

444
00:58:38.993 --> 00:58:40.285
Hi, guys.

445
00:58:47.951 --> 00:58:49.368
Hi. How's it going?

446
00:58:49.494 --> 00:58:50.910
Cooled off a little, huh?

447
00:58:52.076 --> 00:58:53.494
What do you want, Brain?

448
00:58:53.577 --> 00:58:56.243
The Duke told us to wait inside.
He's on his way here now.

449
00:58:56.327 --> 00:58:57.993
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

450
00:58:58.076 --> 00:59:00.535
Well, you can't expect him to tell
everybody in the joint, now can you?

451
00:59:00.619 --> 00:59:02.452
That's why he's the Duke.

452
00:59:02.535 --> 00:59:04.910
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

453
00:59:04.993 --> 00:59:07.494
Well, why don't we wait inside for him?

454
00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.160
Because I got orders, that's why.

455
00:59:09.243 --> 00:59:11.410
Well, what are your specific orders,
by the way?

456
00:59:11.493 --> 00:59:17.368
Specific orders, Brain,
was for me not to let no one go inside.

457
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.160
How's the President holding up by the way?

458
00:59:20.243 --> 00:59:23.285
Any political discussions
you've had with him?

459
00:59:24.452 --> 00:59:27.744
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.

460
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:30.660
He's always sniffing around like a dog.

461
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:32.910
He comes up with the gas.

462
00:59:37.868 --> 00:59:39.868
What are you looking at?

463
00:59:54.243 --> 00:59:56.202
Are you from the outside?

464
00:59:56.285 --> 00:59:58.160
- Stop shaking.
- I can't.

465
00:59:58.243 --> 01:00:01.252
- Who are you?
- Hauk sent me in. We've gotta move fast.

466
01:00:01.352 --> 01:00:03.951
Move fast?
You're goddamn right I'll move fast.

467
01:00:04.076 --> 01:00:05.702
Keep quiet. Keep moving.

468
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.951
They got him.

469
01:00:56.035 --> 01:00:57.327
Watch it.

470
01:01:10.327 --> 01:01:12.243
Friend of yours, Brain?

471
01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:16.702
He had a gun on me, Duke.
There was nothing I could do.

472
01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:19.035
Mmm-hmm.

473
01:01:28.202 --> 01:01:29.410
Maggie.

474
01:01:42.577 --> 01:01:44.035
Who are you?

475
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.202
I said, who are you?

476
01:01:55.577 --> 01:01:58.535
Snake Plissken, Duke.
The Man sent him in here.

477
01:01:58.619 --> 01:02:01.160
Something's going down. We need him.

478
01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:16.910
Snake Plissken.

479
01:02:22.285 --> 01:02:23.993
I've heard of you.

480
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:37.785
I heard you were dead.

481
01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:02.702
<i>This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.</i>

482
01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:06.619
<i>Nothing on the infrared body scan.
Nothing in the searchlight.</i>

483
01:03:06.702 --> 01:03:10.660
<i>There aren't any fires on the street.
Nobody moving down there.</i>

484
01:03:10.744 --> 01:03:13.993
<i>Surveillance 5 to Security Control.</i>

485
01:03:14.076 --> 01:03:16.535
<i>Negative on infrared body scan.</i>

486
01:03:16.619 --> 01:03:18.993
<i>No movement in the searchlights.</i>

487
01:03:19.118 --> 01:03:21.493
<i>Something strange going on down there.</i>

488
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.452
- We've got to go in now.
- We hold.

489
01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:38.535
- You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.
- This is my prison. I'll give the orders.

490
01:03:38.619 --> 01:03:42.035
- I override all that.
- Just try.

491
01:03:47.702 --> 01:03:51.776
<i>Surveillance 10. Still negative on the scans.</i>

492
01:03:52.368 --> 01:03:55.327
<i>This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.</i>

493
01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.160
- <i>Nothing on the infrared body scan.</i>
- <i>Make another sweep.</i>

494
01:03:59.243 --> 01:04:02.785
<i>Surveillance 10, still negative on the scans.</i>

495
01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:04.327
<i>Surveillance 5, negative.</i>

496
01:04:04.452 --> 01:04:07.535
<i>The whole prison looks deserted.
There's nothing moving anywhere.</i>

497
01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:09.160
<i>Still circling.</i>

498
01:04:09.243 --> 01:04:11.702
<i>This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.</i>

499
01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:14.285
<i>Nothing on the infrared body scan.
Still negative on...</i>

500
01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:14.993
Don't move, Snake.

501
01:05:32.452 --> 01:05:35.535
I want that diagram, Brain.

502
01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:37.660
It's at my place, Duke.

503
01:05:37.744 --> 01:05:42.243
Duke, that Plissken said
something about a time limit.

504
01:05:42.327 --> 01:05:43.410
What time limit?

505
01:05:43.577 --> 01:05:44.660
On him.

506
01:05:44.744 --> 01:05:46.577
That's a lot of crap.

507
01:05:47.368 --> 01:05:49.202
What did I teach you?

508
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:54.535
You are Duke of New York.

509
01:05:54.619 --> 01:05:56.993
You are A-number-one.

510
01:05:57.076 --> 01:05:58.744
I can't hear you.

511
01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:00.744
You...

512
01:06:02.035 --> 01:06:05.910
You are the Duke of New York!
You are A-number-one!

513
01:06:07.577 --> 01:06:09.327
Get me the diagram.

514
01:06:10.368 --> 01:06:13.577
Duke, don't kill Plissken. We need him.

515
01:06:17.619 --> 01:06:19.327
Get moving, Brain.

516
01:07:45.035 --> 01:07:48.243
<i>People down below in the park.
Can you see them?</i>

517
01:07:48.951 --> 01:07:52.160
<i>Surveillance 10 to Security Control,
are you getting that readout,</i>

518
01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.993
<i>that pulse there on the infrared?</i>

519
01:07:55.076 --> 01:07:57.368
<i>We have a visual sighting on it.</i>

520
01:07:57.494 --> 01:07:59.785
<i>It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.</i>

521
01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:04.452
<i>They're waving at us.
Signaling us from the food-drop area.</i>

522
01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.577
<i>They're waving us down.</i>

523
01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:54.368
I still can't figure out

524
01:08:54.452 --> 01:08:56.951
whether that son of a bitch Plissken
was telling the truth or not.

525
01:08:57.035 --> 01:08:58.868
God, I hate that guy.

526
01:09:00.285 --> 01:09:04.009
- He got in somehow.
- Yeah. Yeah, but how?

527
01:09:05.993 --> 01:09:07.494
You gotta land a glider and take off.

528
01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.702
You can't do it in Central Park,
there's too many trees.

529
01:09:09.785 --> 01:09:12.180
Port Authority is too low to the ground,

530
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.410
unless it was someplace high up.

531
01:09:17.368 --> 01:09:19.826
The World Trade Center, that's it.

532
01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:23.160
Here we go, the World Trade Center
and it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier

533
01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.868
for me to take off
than it was for him to land.

534
01:09:29.368 --> 01:09:33.660
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City
in exchange for President.

535
01:09:34.076 --> 01:09:38.368
"69th Street Bridge, tomorrow, 12:00 noon.
No bullshit or he's dead."

536
01:09:38.452 --> 01:09:41.518
- Where's the tape?
- Not here.

537
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.660
They're Plissken's.

538
01:09:47.744 --> 01:09:49.910
So much for your man, Hauk.

539
01:09:52.368 --> 01:09:54.993
Warm up the choppers. We're moving in.

540
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:10.243
Plissken?

541
01:10:17.577 --> 01:10:19.243
Come on, get up.

542
01:12:51.327 --> 01:12:53.452
They sent in their best man

543
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.993
and when we roll down the 69th Street Bridge
tomorrow on our way to freedom,

544
01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:06.660
we're gonna have their best man
leading the way from the neck up.

545
01:13:18.951 --> 01:13:20.826
On the hood of my car!

546
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.426
Let's do it!

547
01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:13.594
Romero. Where did you get the hat?

548
01:14:13.677 --> 01:14:15.926
- Got it from Cabbie.
- Oh, yeah?

549
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.368
- Traded him.
- For what?

550
01:14:18.452 --> 01:14:21.619
- What are you so nervous about?
- I gotta see the President.

551
01:14:21.702 --> 01:14:23.660
- Who says?
- The Duke.

552
01:14:23.744 --> 01:14:25.535
No, he doesn't.

553
01:14:25.619 --> 01:14:30.076
- Well, I'll have to tell him you said that.
- Wait a minute. Why?

554
01:14:30.243 --> 01:14:32.288
He's got something hidden
in his clothing and the Duke wants it.

555
01:14:32.388 --> 01:14:33.956
- What?
- I'll show you.

556
01:14:34.056 --> 01:14:36.852
- You'll tell me.
- Cyanide capsules.

557
01:14:36.952 --> 01:14:39.444
The Duke don't want a dead president.

558
01:14:41.327 --> 01:14:42.702
Gentlemen.

559
01:14:44.619 --> 01:14:46.118
Mr. President.

560
01:14:59.535 --> 01:15:00.785
Cyanide?

561
01:15:01.118 --> 01:15:04.243
Yeah. He might try to take it tomorrow.

562
01:15:04.327 --> 01:15:06.452
That's a bunch of bullshit.

563
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:10.868
You're not supposed to be in here, Brain.

564
01:17:08.577 --> 01:17:11.660
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

565
01:17:11.744 --> 01:17:14.868
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

566
01:17:21.577 --> 01:17:26.993
<i>Tracer activated at 1 hour,
35 minutes, 27 seconds.</i>

567
01:17:27.368 --> 01:17:28.702
Hauk!

568
01:17:29.327 --> 01:17:32.510
Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake, Snake!

569
01:17:59.243 --> 01:18:01.951
Listen! Listen!

570
01:18:02.826 --> 01:18:05.034
Listen!

571
01:18:05.243 --> 01:18:07.118
The President's gone!

572
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:08.951
Brain took him!

573
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.577
Hauk! Plissken's tracer!

574
01:18:34.826 --> 01:18:37.868
Get on the radio.
Keep them down. Nobody move.

575
01:18:40.619 --> 01:18:43.493
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

576
01:18:43.577 --> 01:18:45.993
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

577
01:18:46.076 --> 01:18:47.577
He's inside.

578
01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:09.494
It's gone.

579
01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:11.368
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.

580
01:19:11.452 --> 01:19:13.826
Download the choppers.
We're in standby situation.

581
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:16.826
Anybody could have pushed that button.

582
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.910
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.

583
01:19:19.993 --> 01:19:22.910
Now, we'll give him a little more time,
just to make sure.

584
01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.035
Goddamn redskins!

585
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:47.619
They're savages, Mr. President.

586
01:20:05.327 --> 01:20:07.160
Listen, Snake, I swear to God
I thought you were dead.

587
01:20:07.243 --> 01:20:10.826
Yeah, you and everybody else.
That your car in the lobby?

588
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:13.076
- Yeah.
- Keys, quick.

589
01:20:14.494 --> 01:20:16.493
- Quick, diagram of the bridge.
- Okay.

590
01:20:16.577 --> 01:20:17.826
Hey, hey, hey.

591
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:19.826
I'm the only one who knows
how to read that, Snake.

592
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:21.160
Stay out of my way, Harold.

593
01:20:21.243 --> 01:20:24.535
Besides, you can't read and drive
at the same time. You need us!

594
01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:28.202
You shouldn't have double-crossed me
again, Brain. Come on, let's go.

595
01:20:28.452 --> 01:20:29.993
- They sawed it off.
- The tape?

596
01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:32.868
- Gone, I don't know where.
- I do.

597
01:20:35.619 --> 01:20:38.619
I swear to God, Snake, I know where it is.
Just take us to the car.

598
01:20:38.744 --> 01:20:40.368
I'll take you right to it.

599
01:20:42.285 --> 01:20:43.410
Shit.

600
01:20:59.327 --> 01:21:00.868
Shit, shit.

601
01:21:00.951 --> 01:21:03.410
Don't talk. Breathe.

602
01:21:03.619 --> 01:21:06.118
- I'm trying.
- Come on, come on! We're wasting time.

603
01:21:06.202 --> 01:21:08.452
What's wrong?

604
01:21:08.535 --> 01:21:10.118
It's dead, Harold.

605
01:21:10.243 --> 01:21:11.826
What?

606
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.577
Here, take this.

607
01:21:17.744 --> 01:21:19.160
Car trouble?

608
01:21:33.368 --> 01:21:34.660
Hi, Duke.

609
01:21:41.202 --> 01:21:43.410
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.

610
01:21:43.493 --> 01:21:45.951
You and Brain just say
goodbye to each other.

611
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:19.160
Go, go!

612
01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.035
There are three mines right here.
Then you go a few blocks...

613
01:22:30.118 --> 01:22:32.951
- They're behind us.
- And then there's three more...

614
01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:35.785
- They come in groups of threes.
- Where's the tape, Brain?

615
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:36.951
- What tape?
- Where is it?

616
01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:40.535
- The tape from the briefcase!
- Oh, that tape. Here it is.

617
01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:43.160
- You traded Romero your hat?
- How did you know?

618
01:22:44.242 --> 01:22:46.243
See? See?

619
01:22:47.118 --> 01:22:51.494
<i>The discovery that tritium
creates only one one-millionth</i>

620
01:22:51.619 --> 01:22:53.826
<i>of the biological damage of iodine...</i>

621
01:22:55.118 --> 01:22:56.535
Here, give me that tape.

622
01:22:56.619 --> 01:22:58.118
Not just yet.

623
01:23:26.243 --> 01:23:27.535
Easy, easy.

624
01:23:27.619 --> 01:23:29.285
Go for it, Snake!

625
01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:30.368
You gotta slow down a little, Snake.

626
01:24:30.452 --> 01:24:32.619
I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.

627
01:24:32.702 --> 01:24:34.076
You think?

628
01:24:43.118 --> 01:24:47.035
Stay left. Stay left, stay left
and then jog right when I tell you.

629
01:24:47.118 --> 01:24:49.577
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

630
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:51.535
Okay, okay, now!

631
01:25:24.076 --> 01:25:27.535
I said jog right, you asshole.

632
01:25:42.076 --> 01:25:44.951
Stay to the right. Stay to the right.

633
01:25:45.035 --> 01:25:46.493
Left, left!

634
01:25:46.577 --> 01:25:48.951
No, hold it! Left!

635
01:25:49.035 --> 01:25:50.702
Left, damn it!

636
01:26:08.494 --> 01:26:09.702
Brain?

637
01:26:12.744 --> 01:26:14.202
Keep moving.

638
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:25.118
Maggie.

639
01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:29.702
He's dead.

640
01:26:30.577 --> 01:26:31.826
Come on.

641
01:27:41.702 --> 01:27:45.327
Station 19, they spotted two cars
on the 69th Street Bridge.

642
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:47.327
- Is it Plissken?
- A taxicab and a Cadillac.

643
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:49.160
The taxi hit a mine.
There's four people on foot.

644
01:27:49.243 --> 01:27:52.243
- Fourteen minutes.
- Get a jeep with a winch over there, fast.

645
01:27:52.327 --> 01:27:56.867
Cronenberg, get over to Station 19.
They're coming across the bridge.

646
01:28:04.294 --> 01:28:08.993
<i>This is Rehme. Security Control,
we have a standby situation.</i>

647
01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:13.493
<i>Repeat, we are on standby footing.
All helicopters, down.</i>

648
01:28:13.577 --> 01:28:16.118
<i>Wall guards, do not fire on prisoners.</i>

649
01:28:16.243 --> 01:28:18.826
<i>Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.</i>

650
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:20.993
<i>All vehicles, stand by.</i>

651
01:28:21.076 --> 01:28:24.243
<i>All vehicles stand by.</i>

652
01:29:52.993 --> 01:29:56.160
You're A-number-one!

653
01:29:56.452 --> 01:29:59.535
You're the Duke! You're the Duke!

654
01:30:02.702 --> 01:30:05.660
You're the Duke.

655
01:30:06.577 --> 01:30:08.302
You're A-number-one.

656
01:30:46.535 --> 01:30:48.285
The tape, Plissken.

657
01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:03.535
That's it.

658
01:31:33.368 --> 01:31:35.785
I've radioed ahead, Mr. President.
They know the situation.

659
01:31:35.868 --> 01:31:38.410
They're waiting for your broadcast.

660
01:31:40.076 --> 01:31:41.243
Yeah.

661
01:31:43.285 --> 01:31:44.327
Hold it.

662
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:46.660
Oh, it's all right.

663
01:31:52.410 --> 01:31:55.410
I wanna thank you.

664
01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:00.410
Anything you want, you just name it.

665
01:32:00.493 --> 01:32:02.619
Just a moment of your time.

666
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:06.118
Three minutes, sir.

667
01:32:07.993 --> 01:32:11.326
- Yes?
- We did get you out.

668
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:15.868
A lot of people died in the process.
I just wondered how you felt about it.

669
01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:17.910
Well, I...

670
01:32:18.785 --> 01:32:20.577
I wanna thank them.

671
01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:24.910
This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

672
01:32:30.368 --> 01:32:35.285
Look, I'm on the air
in two and a half minutes?

673
01:32:35.368 --> 01:32:36.660
Yes, sir.

674
01:33:05.243 --> 01:33:07.494
You gonna kill me now, Snake?

675
01:33:08.076 --> 01:33:09.577
I'm too tired.

676
01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:12.577
Maybe later.

677
01:33:13.327 --> 01:33:15.826
I've got another deal for you.

678
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:19.076
I want you to think it over
while you're resting.

679
01:33:19.785 --> 01:33:21.744
I wanna give you a job.

680
01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:25.993
We'd make one hell of a team, Snake.

681
01:33:30.285 --> 01:33:32.076
The name's Plissken.

682
01:33:42.826 --> 01:33:45.202
<i>You're on camera, Mr. President.</i>

683
01:33:46.076 --> 01:33:47.577
Good evening.

684
01:33:48.951 --> 01:33:51.660
Although I shall not be present

685
01:33:51.785 --> 01:33:54.494
at this historic summit meeting,

686
01:33:56.076 --> 01:33:59.619
I present this in the hope

687
01:34:01.368 --> 01:34:04.689
that our great nations

688
01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:08.459
may learn to live in peace.
