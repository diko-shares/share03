00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.657
<i>This is a true story about
friendship that runs deeper than blood.</i>

2
00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:18.079
<i>This is my story and that of the only three
friends in my life who truly mattered.</i>

3
00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:23.167
<i>Two of them were killers
who never made it past the age of 30.</i>

4
00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:27.046
<i>The other is a non-practicing attorney
living with the pain of his past…</i>

5
00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.550
<i>… too afraid to let it go,
never confronting its horror.</i>

6
00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:37.056
<i>I'm the only one who could speak for them
and the children we were.</i>

7
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.784
<i>My three friends and I were inseparable.</i>

8
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:22.870
<i>Happy and content to live
in the closed world of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

9
00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.124
<i>The West Side streets of Manhattan
were our private playground…</i>

10
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.462
<i>… a cement kingdom where we felt ourselves
to be nothing less than absolute rulers.</i>

11
00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:35.925
<i>Hell's Kitchen was populated by
an uneasy blend of Irish…</i>

12
00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:39.095
<i>… Italian, Puerto Rican
and Eastern European laborers.</i>

13
00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:41.806
<i>Hard men living hard lives.</i>

14
00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.652
<i>We lived in railroad apartments
inside red brick tenements.</i>

15
00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.156
<i>Few mothers worked and all had trouble
with the men they married.</i>

16
00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:08.166
Shut the fuck up! I buried one fucking wife,
I could bury another one.

17
00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.507
<i>Domestic violence
was a cottage industry in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

18
00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:19.343
<i>Yet there was no divorce
and few separations.</i>

19
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.554
<i>The will of the Church was forceful.</i>

20
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:25.224
<i>For a marriage to end,
someone usually had to die.</i>

21
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:29.604
<i>Yet despite the harshness of life…</i>

22
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.774
<i>… Hell's Kitchen offered the kids
on its streets a safety net…</i>

23
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.234
<i>… enjoyed by few other neighborhoods.</i>

24
00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:38.946
<i>Crimes against people of the neighborhood
were not permitted.</i>

25
00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:42.033
<i>When they did occur,
the punishment doled out was severe…</i>

26
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.368
<i>… and in some cases, final.</i>

27
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:48.039
<i>A drug dealer from an uptown neighborhood
moved heroin into Hell's Kitchen.</i>

28
00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:51.375
<i>A packet killed the 12-year-old son
of a Puerto Rican numbers runner.</i>

29
00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.712
<i>It was the last packet
the dealer ever sold.</i>

30
00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:59.842
<i>Hell's Kitchen was a place of innocence
ruled by corruption.</i>

31
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.430
<i>My friends and I spent lots of time
inside Holy Angels.</i>

32
00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:06.682
<i>We each served as altar boys.</i>

33
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.895
<i>Everyone wanted to work funeral masses
since the funeral included a $3 fee…</i>

34
00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:13.898
<i>… and more if you looked
sufficiently somber.</i>

35
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:19.487
<i>There was competition between the four of us
to come up with the best and boldest prank.</i>

36
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:24.700
<i>Two weeks into the new school year, I found
the nun's clacker in the school hallway…</i>

37
00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:27.286
<i>… and I was ready for the big leagues.</i>

38
00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:32.625
<i>In church, it was used to alert the girls when
they should stand, sit, kneel and genuflect…</i>

39
00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:35.586
<i>… all based on the number of times
the clacker was pressed.</i>

40
00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:38.589
<i>In my pocket, it was cause for havoc.</i>

41
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.770
You will be defenders of the faith.
You will be soldiers of Christ.

42
00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:54.897
And you will receive the gifts
of the Holy Spirit.

43
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:07.368
Well, it's going to be a great day
and your parents will be very proud of you.

44
00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:11.038
When you were baptized,
your godparents made promises for you.

45
00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:14.792
- Now you're gonna confirm those promises.
- Let me have the clacker.

46
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.544
- What clacker?
- Now.

47
00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.797
Let everyone rise.

48
00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.635
Let us pray.

49
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:36.606
Nuns are such easy targets.

50
00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:39.984
<i>John and I spent more time
in church than the others.</i>

51
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:43.070
<i>We were the only two to give thought
of entering the priesthood.</i>

52
00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:45.698
<i>We were intrigued by the powers
a priest was given.</i>

53
00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:47.742
<i>A secret world of betrayal and deceit…</i>

54
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.162
<i>… where people openly admitted
dark misdeeds and vile indiscretions.</i>

55
00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:55.166
<i>Confession was better than any book we'd
get our hands on or any movie we'd see…</i>

56
00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.502
<i>… because the sins were real,
committed by people we knew.</i>

57
00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.339
<i>The temptation to be part of that
was too great to resist.</i>

58
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:03.466
If we get caught, they'll burn us.

59
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:05.509
What if our mothers are out there?

60
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:07.845
What if we end up hearing
their confessions?

61
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:10.932
- Yeah, what if we hear something worse?
- Like what?

62
00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.186
Like a murder.
What if somebody cops to a murder?

63
00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:19.106
Relax. All we gotta do is sit back,
listen and remember not to laugh.

64
00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:29.992
<i>Seconds later, our booth comes to life.</i>

65
00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.329
I, uh, sleep with married men.

66
00:07:33.913 --> 00:07:35.957
Men with families.

67
00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:40.878
In the morning, I tell myself
it's the last time, but it never is.

68
00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:44.757
Yes?

69
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:47.385
You see, I'm, uh…

70
00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:49.220
I'm pregnant.

71
00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:54.392
The father?

72
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:56.060
Take a number.

73
00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:58.104
What are you going to do?

74
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.064
I know what you want me to do.

75
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:03.234
And I know what I should do.

76
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.654
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

77
00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:09.615
Look, I gotta go.

78
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.244
Thanks for listening, fellas.
I really appreciate it.

79
00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:16.872
And I know you'll keep it to yourselves.

80
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:23.713
She knew.

81
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.506
She knew.

82
00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:28.259
Why do you think she told us all that?

83
00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:32.138
I don't know.
I guess she had to tell somebody.

84
00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:37.768
<i>Father Robert Carrillo
was a longshoreman's son…</i>

85
00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:41.022
<i>… as comfortable sitting on a bar stool
in a back alley saloon…</i>

86
00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.607
<i>… as he was standing at the altar
during High Mass.</i>

87
00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:46.652
<i>He toyed with a life of petty crime
before finding his calling.</i>

88
00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:49.363
<i>He was a friend
who just happened to be a priest.</i>

89
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.532
Know what crap like that
does to your body?

90
00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:55.327
Come on, Father, it beats smoking.
And it's cheaper too.

91
00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:56.996
Maybe.

92
00:08:57.455 --> 00:08:59.206
So, what do you hear, anything?

93
00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.624
No, nothing.

94
00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:03.169
I hear you're interested
in becoming a priest.

95
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.378
Who says?

96
00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:07.465
Word is you want to get the feel
of a confessional booth.

97
00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:11.260
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't, huh?

98
00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:13.971
- No.
- Well, maybe I got the wrong information.

99
00:09:14.138 --> 00:09:16.557
- Yeah, I guess you did.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.476
I'll see you later tonight.

101
00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:20.394
What's tonight?

102
00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:24.815
Drop books and magazines off for the elderly
and disabled around the neighborhood.

103
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:28.527
- Your mother said you'd love to help.
- Yeah, I bet she did.

104
00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:34.200
Shakes, I don't want you
getting into any trouble.

105
00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:36.660
Come on, Father. You know I never do.

106
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:38.913
That's all I wish for you and your friends.

107
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.707
- That's it?
- That's it. Nothing else, I swear. That's it.

108
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.918
You know, a priest shouldn't swear.

109
00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:46.295
Kids shouldn't listen
to people's confessions.

110
00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:47.505
I'll see you tonight.

111
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.882
- All right, see you.
- Okay.

112
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.638
<i>Michael was the most sexually
experienced of our group…</i>

113
00:09:55.805 --> 00:09:58.474
<i>… which meant he kissed a girl
on more than one occasion.</i>

114
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:02.269
<i>But his real love was Carol Martinez.
Hell's Kitchen's half-breed…</i>

115
00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:05.439
<i>… half-Puerto Rican, half-Irish,
she was raised by her father…</i>

116
00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.483
<i>… her mother having died at childbirth.</i>

117
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.654
<i>Carol stayed pretty much to herself,
but was always comfortable in our company.</i>

118
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:15.741
<i>We could always count on Carol to stand
sentry on the first night of the Ice Capades.</i>

119
00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:18.536
<i>While crowds of families
lined the front of the Garden…</i>

120
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.789
<i>… waiting to see skaters perform,
we each had one eye in a hole…</i>

121
00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:26.001
<i>… watching two dozen beautiful and nearly
naked women get into their skaters' outfits.</i>

122
00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.756
This is what heaven must be about.

123
00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:37.429
Oh, my God.

124
00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.725
Hey, Carol, you want to take a look?

125
00:10:41.976 --> 00:10:43.686
Like it's something I haven't seen.

126
00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.647
You're so lucky! Ha!

127
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:51.735
Oh, wow, she's so beautiful,
I could die now and I wouldn't be sad.

128
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:53.654
<i>When my friends and I were young…</i>

129
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.532
<i>… Hell's Kitchen was run
by a man named King Benny.</i>

130
00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:00.077
When he was young, King
Benny was a hit man for Lucky Luciano.

131
00:11:00.244 --> 00:11:03.455
Lucky Luciano did a lot of good
for this country during World War II.

132
00:11:03.622 --> 00:11:06.417
You ain't gonna read about that
in any fucking history book.

133
00:11:06.584 --> 00:11:09.336
There was talk King Benny
was the shooter of Mad Dog Coll…

134
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:13.924
… that prick on West 23rd Street.
He ran bootleg with Dutch Schultz.

135
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:17.219
And he opened up a couple of clubs
with Tough Tony Anastasio.

136
00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.597
I was 14 when I first heard about him.

137
00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.933
The story goes, as a kid,
he wasn't much of anything.

138
00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:26.437
Always got the shit kicked out of him
in street fights.

139
00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:29.064
And then one day,
and who the fuck knows why…

140
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:32.276
… some Irish guy about 25 years old…

141
00:11:32.443 --> 00:11:35.988
… he takes King Benny
and he flings him down a flight of stairs.

142
00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:39.074
King Benny
breaks all his teeth in the front.

143
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.285
You know what King Benny does?

144
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.579
He waits.

145
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:47.416
He waits 8 years
to get even with that prick.

146
00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:51.503
He walks into a public bath house.
The guy's soaking in the tub.

147
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.926
<i>King Benny takes out his front teeth.
He lays them down on the sink.</i>

148
00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.929
Then he looks over at the guy
and he says:

149
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.226
<i>"When I look in the mirror,
I see your face."</i>

150
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.853
Then he pulls out a gun…

151
00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.564
… and he shoots the guy twice
in each leg.

152
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:12.691
Bang, bang! Bang, bang!

153
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.152
Then he says to the guy:

154
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:20.074
<i>"Now when you take a bath,
you see mine."</i>

155
00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:24.036
No one ever fucked with
King Benny after that.

156
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.664
Revenge.

157
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.166
Revenge.

158
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.752
<i>I'm all alone</i>

159
00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:33.921
Can I talk to you for a minute?

160
00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:37.007
I'd like to work for you.
Help you out, whatever you need.

161
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:41.345
- You're the butcher's kid, am I right?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:44.181
Well, what kind of job
are you looking for?

163
00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:45.724
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

164
00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:49.228
Oh, it doesn't matter?

165
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.314
Everybody says
this is the place to come for jobs.

166
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.024
Who is everybody?

167
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.985
People from the neighborhood.

168
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.444
Oh, them.

169
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.364
Let me ask you,
what the fuck do they know?

170
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.116
They know you got jobs.

171
00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:10.124
Sorry I wasted your time.

172
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.794
- Hold on a sec.
- Yeah?

173
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.838
Come back tomorrow if you want to work.

174
00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:17.798
- What time tomorrow?
- Any time.

175
00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.049
You'll be here?

176
00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.677
I'm always here.

177
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.561
<i>My first job for King Benny
paid $25 a week…</i>

178
00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:33.605
<i>… and ate up only 40 minutes of my time.</i>

179
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:36.483
<i>In the dark club room,
one guy would hand me a paper bag…</i>

180
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.820
<i>… direct me to one of the two
local police precincts for delivery.</i>

181
00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.905
<i>Hey, it was a perfect way
to handle payouts.</i>

182
00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:45.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, let's go! Right here.

183
00:13:45.576 --> 00:13:47.286
See what kind of cash
you got in that bag.

184
00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:49.747
You gotta be nuts.
You know who you're taking off?

185
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.916
Yeah, we know
and we're scared shitless.

186
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.086
Give me the bag.
Give me the fucking bag!

187
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:58.464
Hey, what you do there?

188
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.799
Answer me! What you do there?

189
00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:03.552
- He took my money.
- You took the money from the boy?

190
00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:06.138
- The money is in the bag.
- Let me have the bag.

191
00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:08.015
- Fuck you!
- Oh, yeah?

192
00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:09.975
- How about now?
- All right, take it easy.

193
00:14:10.142 --> 00:14:14.396
Ah, you're not smart anymore?
This make you stupid?

194
00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:16.023
Let me have the bag.

195
00:14:19.485 --> 00:14:21.195
- Now go.
- What about them?

196
00:14:21.362 --> 00:14:22.404
- You care?
- No.

197
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:24.198
Then go! Go! Run!

198
00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:27.910
<i>I need somebody with me.</i>

199
00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:29.161
<i>What if the old guy hadn't showed?</i>

200
00:14:29.828 --> 00:14:31.955
- What you need?
- My friends.

201
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.625
Your friends?
What do you think, this is camp?

202
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:38.045
These kids, you can trust.
I've known them half my life.

203
00:14:39.755 --> 00:14:41.548
Okay, get your friends.

204
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:44.968
<i>Father Bobby knew my friends
and I worked for King Benny.</i>

205
00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:46.136
<i>He wasn't pleased.</i>

206
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:48.847
<i>He wasn't worried about the pocket money,
but the next step…</i>

207
00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:52.476
<i>… when they ask you to pick up a gun.
He didn't want that to happen to us.</i>

208
00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.729
- Running for King Benny is a good idea?
- It pays.

209
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.649
- It pays? A lot of things pay.
- Not like this.

210
00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.359
Whoa!

211
00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:03.070
<i>Most priests liked
to preach from the pulpit.</i>

212
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:07.157
<i>Father Bobby liked to talk during
the bump and shove of a pickup game.</i>

213
00:15:07.324 --> 00:15:08.575
Good shot!

214
00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:13.205
- I found an art class for you to take.
- I can't afford art class.

215
00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:16.291
You don't have to pay anything.
The teacher's a friend of mine.

216
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:19.169
I don't know. Could be nothing
but a waste of time, Father.

217
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.172
- Maybe, or it could be the first step.
- First step to what?

218
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.842
- To do something with your life.
- May help you get out.

219
00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:28.470
- You all can get out of here.
- Guys, are we gonna talk or play basketball?

220
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:31.932
I got a story to tell you.

221
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.810
Ain't the one about lepers, is it?
That gave me nightmares.

222
00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:37.855
No lepers. Michelangelo.
He was born poor, just like you guys.

223
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.940
He was a painter, he was a sculptor.

224
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:43.402
He takes this job from the pope.
Good money, good work.

225
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.697
Okay, Father,
but why'd the pope call him?

226
00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:50.951
Pope looked for the best guy he could find
to paint the ceiling of his church in Rome.

227
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:54.496
- Don't sound like that big a job, Father.
- Well, for Michelangelo it was.

228
00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:59.042
Michelangelo needed the job because it paid
more money than he ever had in his life.

229
00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:02.379
He could pay off the loan sharks
that were chasing his father down.

230
00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:06.550
- What's his father?
- He was like a low-level con guy.

231
00:16:06.717 --> 00:16:08.719
Conned people out of money,
goats, sheep—

232
00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:10.304
- Goats?
- Chickens, whatever.

233
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:12.973
- Chickens?
- You know what happened?

234
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.435
- What?
- He painted a ceiling no one will ever forget.

235
00:16:16.602 --> 00:16:19.062
Painted it like he was touched
by the hand of God.

236
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.899
- Did he pay off the loans?
- Every single one of them.

237
00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.985
Hey, how long did it take him,
painting the ceiling and all?

238
00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:27.946
- Took him about nine years.
- Nine years?

239
00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:29.448
- A big ceiling.
- Right.

240
00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:32.409
I had a Puerto Rican guy
do my whole apartment in two days.

241
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:33.660
And he had a bum leg.

242
00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.580
You know, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you guys.

243
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.583
Just give us a job painting,
leave the rest to us.

244
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.085
- It was the Sistine Chapel.
- Sixteenth Chapel?

245
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:45.088
- Sistine Chapel.
- Who painted the other 15?

246
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:56.808
<i>Outside events meant little.
In a society changing radically by the hour…</i>

247
00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:00.229
<i>… we watched the images scatter nightly
across the TV screens.</i>

248
00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:05.317
<i>Young protesters spoke about how they were
going to change our lives and fix the world.</i>

249
00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:09.947
<i>But while they shouted their slogans,
my friends and I went to funeral services…</i>

250
00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:15.118
<i>… for the young men of Hell's Kitchen
who came back from Vietnam in body bags.</i>

251
00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:18.622
<i>We viewed with skepticism
the faces on television…</i>

252
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:22.251
<i>… those protected by money
and upper-middle-class standing.</i>

253
00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:30.050
<i>A growing army of feminists marched
across the country demanding equality.</i>

254
00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:34.179
<i>Yet our mothers cooked and cared for men
who abused them mentally and physically.</i>

255
00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:39.810
<i>For me and my friends,
these developments carried no weight.</i>

256
00:17:39.977 --> 00:17:44.773
<i>They might as well have occurred
in another country, in another century.</i>

257
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.942
<i>Our attention was elsewhere.</i>

258
00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:49.945
<i>We sat with Father Bobby
in a hospital ward, visiting John…</i>

259
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:52.322
<i>… hoping he'd recover
from a punctured lung…</i>

260
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:55.158
<i>… a gift from one of his mother's
overzealous boyfriends.</i>

261
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:58.787
I hope you like these.
You better not tell me you don't.

262
00:17:58.954 --> 00:18:00.706
Okay.

263
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:05.168
<i>Father Bobby
didn't let that situation rest.</i>

264
00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.379
I gave on Sunday. I'm in a rush, okay?

265
00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.464
- John Reilly.
- The little punk.

266
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.050
Got out of line. I put him back in line.
No big deal.

267
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:14.886
- You put him in the hospital.
- He's alive, ain't he?

268
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.681
Look, if he's smart,
he learned himself a lesson.

269
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:20.809
- What are you, about 220, 230?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:20.976 --> 00:18:24.896
You're a big guy.
How much you think John Reilly weighs?

271
00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.690
Eighty, 85?

272
00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:31.278
That's not even a featherweight. This were
a fight, you'd be way out of your division.

273
00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:34.948
Look, it was a slap. It was nothing.

274
00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:37.576
Well, next time, you'll be meeting me.

275
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.789
And I may not be in your division,
but I do weigh more than 85 pounds.

276
00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:49.129
And you won't need a doctor when I'm done.
You'll need a priest to pray over your body.

277
00:18:52.674 --> 00:18:54.509
See you in church.

278
00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:01.850
Father Bobby
would have made a good hit man.

279
00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:05.437
It's a shame we lost him
to the other side.

280
00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:10.901
<i>We were down 7-6 in the last
inning of a sewer-to-sewer stickball game…</i>

281
00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:13.487
<i>… against Hector Maldonado
and three of his friends.</i>

282
00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:17.491
Come on, Davy, strike this chump out.
He got nothing!

283
00:19:17.658 --> 00:19:18.742
Shut up!

284
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:21.912
- Who's that?
- His sister.

285
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:23.914
- What happened to her?
- I'm not sure.

286
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:27.376
Some kind of cancer got in her legs
or something. Worry about the game.

287
00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:31.129
- Concentrate. Hit a home run.
- Come on, Davy, strike the scumbag out.

288
00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.423
He can't touch you, Davy.
He can't touch you.

289
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.093
While you don't got any legs,
you got a lot of tongue!

290
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:38.011
- All right.
- This is it, home run.

291
00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.597
- Easy, Mike.
- Yeah, Davy.

292
00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:43.100
What the fuck you looking at, little dick?

293
00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.352
She's nothing but charm.

294
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.854
- Let's play, man. Let's play.
- Come on, Davy.

295
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.523
You can take him, Michael.

296
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.400
Yeah, I told you he wasn't shit, baby!

297
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.777
Hey, swallow your tongue,
you little gimp bitch!

298
00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:56.822
Could've helped her across the street
or bought her ice cream.

299
00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.448
You didn't have to throw the game.

300
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.617
Yeah, now we're the Salvation Army.

301
00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:03.161
You ever wonder why
there ain't a Salvation Navy?

302
00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:06.540
Game over, losers.
Cough up the cash. A buck each.

303
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.625
He's no better than you.

304
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:09.876
He was today.

305
00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:11.920
You let him be.

306
00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:15.090
All because Irish here has a thing
for little girls with no legs.

307
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:17.509
Look, stay away from this,
fat man, all right?

308
00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.929
You boys are soft like bread.
It's going to catch up to you.

309
00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:23.140
And when it does, it's going to hurt bad.

310
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:26.476
What happens is our business,
not yours, okay?

311
00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.478
You gotta stay tough to be tough.

312
00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:31.398
Guy smells it when you're weak,
eat you like a salad.

313
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:36.278
You see that street? That street is the dish
of life and you boys are appetizers.

314
00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:39.823
Somebody gonna come along,
eat you up and forget about you by dessert.

315
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.409
Take it easy, fat man.
It was just a stickball game.

316
00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:45.579
Yeah, but going soft is a habit,
you know?

317
00:20:45.746 --> 00:20:48.874
You have to keep yourself mean
and cut your life around it.

318
00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:53.670
All right, calm down. It's like hanging out
with fucking Confucius over here.

319
00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.714
Be funny, limp dick.

320
00:20:55.881 --> 00:20:59.843
This is just free advice from me to you.
Take it or throw it away. It don't matter.

321
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.678
Thanks a lot, fat man.

322
00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:06.141
<i>In truth, we were all surprised
by Michael's actions.</i>

323
00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.018
<i>But in his mind, losing that game…</i>

324
00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:11.104
<i>… and handing a feeling of victory
to a girl in a wheelchair…</i>

325
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.523
<i>… was more than the right thing to do.</i>

326
00:21:22.324 --> 00:21:23.700
Come on, let's go swimming.

327
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:25.994
<i>The temperature
topped out at 98 degrees…</i>

328
00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:28.497
<i>… on the day our lives
were forever altered.</i>

329
00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.123
I'm frying like an egg up here.

330
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.377
I say we get some butter rolls, sodas,
head down to the docks, cool off.

331
00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:37.756
- Can't you feel the breeze?
- What breeze? We're surrounded by a wall.

332
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:41.718
- The devil couldn't even stand this heat.
- I'm trying to get my burn.

333
00:21:41.885 --> 00:21:43.428
It's 98 degrees.

334
00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:46.264
- There's some breeze.
- It's a hot breeze.

335
00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.517
We haven't hit the hot dog vendor
in a couple weeks.

336
00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:51.812
I don't know, Mikey.
That cart guy ain't like the others.

337
00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:55.816
I mean, he gets pretty pissed,
like crazy when you try to take him off.

338
00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:59.986
We can eat hot dogs
or we can eat air. Choose.

339
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.323
Air is probably safer, Mike.

340
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.784
A hot dog ain't worth
bleeding over, Mikey.

341
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:09.329
- Yeah, but anyway, whose turn was it?
- Yours.

342
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.998
- Yeah, it's yours.
- Mine? It's not my turn.

343
00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.917
- Yes, it is.
- I went like last month.

344
00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:15.377
- He went—
- You never went.

345
00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:17.295
- Last month.
- I went right after him.

346
00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.713
- I'm not going.
- Why?

347
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.758
It's too hot.
If I walk down the stairs, I'll pass out.

348
00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:27.597
Mustard, onions, no soda.

349
00:22:27.764 --> 00:22:28.807
I know you.

350
00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:31.017
I look like a lot of people.

351
00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:32.811
<i>The scam was simple.</i>

352
00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:36.606
<i>I was to walk up to the hot dog vendor
and order what I wanted.</i>

353
00:22:36.773 --> 00:22:40.610
<i>The vendor would then hand me my hot dog
and watch as I ran off without paying.</i>

354
00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:43.780
<i>This left the vendor with two choices,
neither very appealing.</i>

355
00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:47.367
<i>He could stand his ground and
swallow his loss, or he could give chase.</i>

356
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:52.289
<i>The second forces him to abandon the cart,
where my friends could feast in his absence.</i>

357
00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:56.543
Uh, I'm gonna need two napkins.

358
00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:00.797
Pay my money, thief!

359
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.801
Yes!

360
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:10.015
- Ketchup.
<i>- I took it from him and ran.</i>

361
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:14.519
<i>I scooted past Tommy Mug's Dry Cleaners
and Armond's Shoe Repair.</i>

362
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:18.523
<i>The vendor gave chase, a wooden-handled
pronged fork in one hand.</i>

363
00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:21.318
All right, all right.
Oh, you're gonna give me two?

364
00:23:31.953 --> 00:23:33.830
These things are heavier than they look.

365
00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:36.875
Genius, it's the gas tanks
that keep the food hot.

366
00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.169
They're heavier than shit.

367
00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:41.713
Think we can push it, the three of us?

368
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.173
Push it where, huh?

369
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.176
Couple of blocks.
It'll be a nice surprise for the guy…

370
00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:50.013
… when he comes back from
chasing Shakes not to find his cart.

371
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.285
<i>The vendor tired at 47th and 9th.</i>

372
00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:14.204
<i>I was on the other side of the street.</i>

373
00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:18.792
<i>He was beat, but not beaten.</i>

374
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:21.294
<i>He could go 10 minutes more
just on hate alone.</i>

375
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:25.256
Come on. Give it up.

376
00:24:37.978 --> 00:24:39.229
What's wrong, Mikey?

377
00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:44.192
Shakes is taking too long.
He should've been back by now.

378
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:46.069
He'll be fine. He's Shakes.

379
00:24:48.863 --> 00:24:51.741
You guys were supposed
to take the hot dogs, not the wagon.

380
00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:53.785
- Now he tells us.
- He's coming fast.

381
00:24:53.952 --> 00:24:55.203
- He still near?
- Let's go!

382
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.664
I got a plan.
Come on, over by the subway.

383
00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:00.917
<i>The plan, as it turned out,
was as simple and as dumb…</i>

384
00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:02.377
<i>… as anything we had ever done.</i>

385
00:25:02.544 --> 00:25:05.046
<i>We'd hold the cart on the top edge
of the stairwell…</i>

386
00:25:05.213 --> 00:25:07.215
<i>… lean it downward
and wait for the vendor.</i>

387
00:25:07.382 --> 00:25:09.634
<i>We'd let it go
the second he grabbed the handles.</i>

388
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:13.263
<i>We'd leave the scene as he struggled
to ease the cart back on the sidewalk.</i>

389
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.765
<i>To this day, I don't know why we did it.</i>

390
00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:18.268
<i>But we would all pay a price.</i>

391
00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:21.646
<i>It only took a minute,
but in that minute, everything changed.</i>

392
00:25:21.813 --> 00:25:24.482
Guys, I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

393
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:26.359
- Don't let go!
- I can't hold it!

394
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:30.363
I can't hold it!

395
00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:45.128
Stop! God, no!

396
00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:09.486
Damn!

397
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.034
Sweet Jesus.

398
00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:18.244
What have you boys done?

399
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:20.789
What in the name of God
have you boys done?

400
00:26:20.955 --> 00:26:23.500
I think we just killed a man.

401
00:26:27.962 --> 00:26:31.591
<i>While James Caldwell was
slowly recovering at Saint Clare's Hospital…</i>

402
00:26:31.758 --> 00:26:33.968
<i>… we were charged
with reckless endangerment…</i>

403
00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.346
<i>… and remanded
into our parents' custody.</i>

404
00:26:36.513 --> 00:26:37.680
I'm sorry, Dad.

405
00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:40.058
That ain't gonna do you much good.

406
00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:43.895
Take it easy. This is no time to get crazy.

407
00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:47.398
You're going to jail.
You don't even know what that means.

408
00:26:47.565 --> 00:26:49.275
Ma!

409
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.611
- Stay out of this.
- Bastard.

410
00:26:51.778 --> 00:26:54.114
He's just a kid!
He shouldn't have to do time!

411
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.366
Nobody in this family
should have to do time.

412
00:26:56.533 --> 00:26:59.702
I done enough time for everybody!

413
00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:26.896
I hear you're short an altar boy.

414
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:32.861
You still remember what to do?

415
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.948
Easy on the water, heavy on the wine.

416
00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:39.826
And ring the bells whenever
I see someone start to nod off.

417
00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:43.496
Get ready.
We got five minutes to showtime.

418
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.927
I'm gonna miss this.

419
00:28:00.138 --> 00:28:02.432
I'm gonna miss all of this.

420
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.062
I've been doing all I can,
but so far, every door I touch is locked.

421
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:13.318
I could run.

422
00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:16.196
We all could run.

423
00:28:18.323 --> 00:28:20.283
Disappear for a while.

424
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:22.452
Nobody's gonna come looking.

425
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:26.122
Nobody's gonna care about us.

426
00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:28.124
About where we go.

427
00:28:33.713 --> 00:28:36.799
You run now, you gonna run till you die.

428
00:28:38.718 --> 00:28:43.181
Hiding's not gonna make it go away.
People aren't gonna forget.

429
00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:46.226
You've gotta face this.

430
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:54.192
I can't, Father.

431
00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:58.321
I don't want to face it.

432
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:02.242
I'm too scared to face it.

433
00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:04.702
I'm scared too.

434
00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:07.580
Nobody's more scared than I am…

435
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:09.874
… but you gotta do it.

436
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.587
You're gonna be okay.

437
00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:17.048
You're gonna make it through there.

438
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.676
You understand?

439
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.183
Come on. We got an audience.

440
00:29:33.564 --> 00:29:37.402
I counted three rummies
and four widows on my way in.

441
00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:42.824
Plus Fat Ralphie
sleeping one off in the last row.

442
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.286
It's the rain.
Bad weather always brings in the crowds.

443
00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:54.210
This is one of my favorites.

444
00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:56.754
What is?

445
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.468
"Whatever you do to the least
of my brethren, you do to me."

446
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:08.266
Come on.

447
00:30:14.522 --> 00:30:16.816
<i>We never saw the vendor as a man.</i>

448
00:30:16.983 --> 00:30:19.444
<i>Not the way we saw other men
of the neighborhood.</i>

449
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.239
<i>And we didn't care enough about him
to grant him any respect.</i>

450
00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:26.951
<i>We gave little notice to how hard he worked
or that he had a wife…</i>

451
00:30:27.118 --> 00:30:30.246
<i>… and two kids in Greece,
and hoped to bring them to this country.</i>

452
00:30:30.413 --> 00:30:32.832
<i>We didn't pay attention
to the long hours he worked.</i>

453
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:34.876
<i>We didn't see any of that.</i>

454
00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:37.503
<i>We only saw a free lunch.</i>

455
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:42.759
Thomas Marcano, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded…

456
00:30:42.925 --> 00:30:46.179
… for a period of no more than 18 months,
no less than one year…

457
00:30:46.346 --> 00:30:48.181
… at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

458
00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:51.976
John Reilly, the court hereby sentences you
to be remanded…

459
00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:55.521
… for a period of no more than 18 months,
no less than one year…

460
00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:57.273
… to the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

461
00:30:57.732 --> 00:30:59.317
Lorenzo Carcaterra.

462
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.029
<i>Taking into consideration
that you arrived on the scene…</i>

463
00:31:03.196 --> 00:31:05.698
<i>… after the theft of the cart
had already occurred…</i>

464
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:08.534
<i>… in consideration of that,
the court sentences you…</i>

465
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:11.496
<i>… to serve no more than one year,
no less than six months…</i>

466
00:31:11.662 --> 00:31:13.664
… at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.

467
00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:17.919
Michael Sullivan, the court hereby
sentences you to be remanded…

468
00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:21.172
<i>… for a period of no more than 18 months,
no less than one year…</i>

469
00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:22.965
<i>… at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.</i>

470
00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:26.928
And I might add, had it not been for
the intervention of Father Robert Carrillo…

471
00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:29.222
… who spoke in glowing terms
on your behalf…

472
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:32.475
<i>… I would have sentenced you
to a much stiffer punishment.</i>

473
00:31:32.642 --> 00:31:34.894
<i>I still have doubts
as to your inherent goodness.</i>

474
00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:37.355
Only time will serve to prove me wrong.

475
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:42.610
Could you do me a favor, Father?

476
00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:44.153
What do you want? Name it.

477
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.114
The past couple of weeks…

478
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.492
… my mother and father looked like
they're ready to kill each other.

479
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:52.662
- Could you watch over them for me?
- I will.

480
00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:56.582
And no matter what you hear,
tell them I'm doing okay.

481
00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:58.709
You mean you want me to lie?

482
00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:03.256
It's a good lie, Father. You could do it.

483
00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:08.094
Come on, let's go.

484
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.473
- Be strong.
- I will.

485
00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:52.680
<i>The Wilkinson Home for Boys
held 780 youthful offenders…</i>

486
00:32:52.847 --> 00:32:54.891
<i>… housed in five separate units.</i>

487
00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:57.226
<i>From the outside,
the facility resembled…</i>

488
00:32:57.393 --> 00:33:00.188
<i>… what those who ran it
wanted it to resemble:</i>

489
00:33:00.354 --> 00:33:03.566
<i>Some kind of nice school or university.</i>

490
00:33:04.358 --> 00:33:08.446
<i>Michael, Tommy, John and I were
assigned to the second floor of Group C.</i>

491
00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:11.032
<i>We each had a private 12-foot room.</i>

492
00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:15.495
<i>I had been in my room less than an hour
when the panic set in.</i>

493
00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:18.581
<i>It doesn't take very long
to know how tough a person you are…</i>

494
00:33:18.748 --> 00:33:20.416
<i>… or how strong you can be.</i>

495
00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:25.880
<i>I knew from my first day at Wilkinson
that I was neither tough nor strong.</i>

496
00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:38.184
Hello, Carcaterra.

497
00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:41.771
Toss your clothes on the floor.

498
00:33:42.355 --> 00:33:44.524
- Here?
- What, you expecting a dressing room?

499
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.943
We don't have any. Now lose the clothes.

500
00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:48.528
In front of you?

501
00:33:57.286 --> 00:33:58.788
Let's go, let's go.

502
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.801
What's that piece of shit around your neck?
Take it off.

503
00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:14.512
It's Mary, you know, the mother of God?

504
00:34:14.845 --> 00:34:17.682
I don't give a fuck whose mother it is.
Take it off.

505
00:34:30.486 --> 00:34:31.737
Everything.

506
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.992
- So you want me to stand here naked?
- Now you're catching on.

507
00:34:36.158 --> 00:34:39.453
I knew you Hell's Kitchen boys
weren't as dumb as everyone says.

508
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:48.004
Now what?

509
00:34:50.673 --> 00:34:52.466
Get dressed.

510
00:34:56.804 --> 00:34:59.015
<i>There were four guards
assigned to each floor…</i>

511
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.976
<i>… with one, in our case, Nokes,
designated group leader.</i>

512
00:35:04.353 --> 00:35:07.106
<i>Ferguson was the only son of a slain
New York State trooper.</i>

513
00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:11.152
<i>Was on the waiting list for the New York City
and Suffolk County Police Departments.</i>

514
00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:15.823
<i>Styler was using his job at Wilkinson's
to finance his way through law school.</i>

515
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.200
<i>Addison was a graduate of
a local high school…</i>

516
00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:21.203
<i>… who wanted nothing more
than a steady job that paid well.</i>

517
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:25.041
<i>It was not a group of innocent
young boys at Wilkinson.</i>

518
00:35:25.207 --> 00:35:27.168
<i>Most if not all the inmates
belonged there.</i>

519
00:35:27.335 --> 00:35:30.087
<i>A number were riding out
their second and third convictions.</i>

520
00:35:30.254 --> 00:35:34.300
<i>All were violent offenders. Few seemed
sorry about what they had done.</i>

521
00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:38.220
<i>And as for rehabilitation, forget it.</i>

522
00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:15.466
Hey, what the fuck did you do that for?

523
00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:20.137
- You got close to me.
- So?

524
00:36:20.304 --> 00:36:22.098
It bothers me.

525
00:36:22.598 --> 00:36:25.851
I don't want to be near you
or your creeped-out friends.

526
00:36:31.273 --> 00:36:33.567
Oh, yeah, fight!

527
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:25.035
You know, your time here
hasn't taught you shit.

528
00:37:26.078 --> 00:37:31.125
You're still the same fucking bunch of
clowns you were the day you walked in here.

529
00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:36.005
Okay, everybody go on back
and finish your lunches.

530
00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:38.507
There's nothing more to see.

531
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.677
Go on, go, sit down. Get out of here.

532
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.222
Go on.

533
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:48.350
Go ahead.

534
00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:56.776
That go for me too?

535
00:37:57.276 --> 00:37:59.028
No, it don't go for you.

536
00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:02.323
You go back to your room.
You're through with your lunch.

537
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.575
Go on.

538
00:38:05.242 --> 00:38:08.329
You and me, we're gonna finish this
sometime real soon.

539
00:38:08.746 --> 00:38:10.039
Maybe at dinner.

540
00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:15.211
So you Hell's Kitchen boys
get any lunch?

541
00:38:17.087 --> 00:38:18.255
I got to smell it.

542
00:38:20.049 --> 00:38:22.426
You got to smell it. Ha, ha.

543
00:38:25.054 --> 00:38:26.055
That's good.

544
00:38:26.222 --> 00:38:28.557
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

545
00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.392
You said to get lunch.

546
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:33.896
You boys don't need to get back in line
to get lunch…

547
00:38:34.063 --> 00:38:37.817
… because there's plenty to eat
right where you're standing.

548
00:38:38.067 --> 00:38:39.944
You could smell it.

549
00:38:44.907 --> 00:38:46.116
I'm not hungry.

550
00:38:46.951 --> 00:38:49.912
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you're hungry or not.

551
00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:53.082
You eat because I'm telling you to eat.

552
00:38:57.253 --> 00:38:58.337
I'm still not hungry.

553
00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:08.138
I'll tell you when you're hungry or not.
Now eat.

554
00:39:10.766 --> 00:39:13.352
Excuse me,
what the fuck are you looking at?

555
00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:18.732
Get the fuck down on your knees now
and finish your goddamn lunch!

556
00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:22.987
Come on now, eat! Don't think you got
all fucking day here! Eat!

557
00:39:23.153 --> 00:39:26.657
You got some mashed potatoes.
Come on, suck up some of that Jell-O.

558
00:39:26.824 --> 00:39:30.578
Come on now, you fucking assholes, eat!
Don't be thinking you got all day.

559
00:39:30.744 --> 00:39:33.163
Hurry up. Come on, now, let's go.
Let's go.

560
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:35.958
Hey, none of you clowns
are leaving here…

561
00:39:36.125 --> 00:39:38.460
… until these assholes
finish their goddamn lunch.

562
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:42.131
You got that? Hey, you.
Here's a piece of bread. There you go.

563
00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:45.467
You can't have a good lunch
without a nice piece of bread. Eat!

564
00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:48.846
Let's go. Come on, now.
That's good. That's good.

565
00:39:49.013 --> 00:39:51.140
Yeah, show the boys
how you follow my rules.

566
00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:54.643
Rules! You understand?

567
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:58.063
Hey, look, boys,
see how he follows my rules?

568
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.316
Your shift's over, Nokes.

569
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:02.484
No, I'm not ready to go yet.

570
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:06.405
I still got a few more things
I gotta clean up here before I can leave.

571
00:40:06.572 --> 00:40:09.366
It's my tour now.
I'll clean what needs cleaning.

572
00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:12.328
Stay out of this one.
It's got nothing to do with you.

573
00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:15.748
This one, I'm staying in.

574
00:40:19.335 --> 00:40:20.586
Don't fuck with me, boy.

575
00:40:22.588 --> 00:40:24.506
No, Nokes.

576
00:40:24.673 --> 00:40:26.926
You fuck with me.

577
00:40:27.635 --> 00:40:30.095
I'm asking you.

578
00:40:35.851 --> 00:40:37.770
You're eating into my shift.

579
00:40:40.439 --> 00:40:42.232
I'll get out of your way.

580
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.193
For now.

581
00:40:45.277 --> 00:40:47.655
I'll take what I can get.

582
00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:51.742
You boys get off your knees.

583
00:41:04.546 --> 00:41:08.217
It's a tragedy. I'll tell you.

584
00:41:08.384 --> 00:41:12.596
I don't understand you boys. I don't think
you know what it means to have rules.

585
00:41:12.763 --> 00:41:15.099
You gotta have rules
and you gotta have discipline.

586
00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:19.269
Now, I don't know what it was like
in your homes, in your home lives…

587
00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:22.773
… but in my house with my father,
there were rules.

588
00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.485
And if you didn't follow the rules,
there was hell to pay.

589
00:41:26.652 --> 00:41:30.447
You had rules and you had discipline.

590
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:36.412
Sometimes, it wasn't nice,
but, boy, we learned. We sure did learn.

591
00:41:37.788 --> 00:41:41.333
Yeah, right around there to the right.
There you go. Come on, now.

592
00:41:46.755 --> 00:41:52.011
I mean, it's a simple thing, really.
You got rules and you got discipline.

593
00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:55.264
That's the beginning of the story
and that's the end of the story.

594
00:42:02.312 --> 00:42:03.939
We understand each other?

595
00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:06.692
- Turn and face the wall.
- Face the wall.

596
00:42:10.446 --> 00:42:12.281
You too.

597
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.037
Now, we got interrupted earlier
in the lunch room…

598
00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:21.790
… but there's no one
to interrupt us here now.

599
00:42:31.717 --> 00:42:33.343
What do you want?

600
00:42:35.262 --> 00:42:36.472
A blow job.

601
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:45.981
Down on your knees.

602
00:42:49.443 --> 00:42:51.111
- Face the wall.
- Aah!

603
00:43:08.378 --> 00:43:11.673
<i>There are no clear pictures
of the sexual abuse we endured.</i>

604
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.010
<i>I buried it as deep as it can possibly go.</i>

605
00:43:15.177 --> 00:43:18.055
<i>What I remember most clearly
from that chilly October night…</i>

606
00:43:18.222 --> 00:43:22.851
<i>… was that it was my 14th birthday
and the end of my childhood.</i>

607
00:43:32.236 --> 00:43:35.781
<i>Early in my stay,
I'd written and asked my father not to come.</i>

608
00:43:35.948 --> 00:43:39.827
<i>I couldn't look at my father and have him
see in my face all that'd happened to me.</i>

609
00:43:39.993 --> 00:43:43.038
<i>Michael had done the same
with interested members of his family.</i>

610
00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:45.457
<i>Tommy's mother couldn't
get it together to visit.</i>

611
00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:48.210
<i>John's mother came up once a month.</i>

612
00:43:50.921 --> 00:43:54.216
<i>But no one could stop Father Bobby
from visiting.</i>

613
00:43:55.217 --> 00:43:59.221
So listen, let's try to keep this
on a happy note, okay?

614
00:43:59.388 --> 00:44:02.307
<i>Nokes warned us
not to say anything to Father Bobby.</i>

615
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:06.145
<i>If we did, reprisals would be severe.</i>

616
00:44:20.075 --> 00:44:21.577
You lost a few pounds.

617
00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:24.955
It's not exactly home cooking.

618
00:44:25.414 --> 00:44:26.999
Sit down.

619
00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:30.586
So I get to see
all four of you guys today.

620
00:44:31.211 --> 00:44:34.756
<i>I loved Father Bobby,
but I couldn't stand to look at him.</i>

621
00:44:35.132 --> 00:44:39.261
<i>I was afraid he'd look right through me,
past the fear and shame, right to the truth.</i>

622
00:44:39.428 --> 00:44:42.764
Shakes, is there anything
you want to tell me?

623
00:44:43.974 --> 00:44:45.767
Anything at all?

624
00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:49.521
You shouldn't come here anymore,
Father.

625
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.358
I appreciate it and all…

626
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:56.737
… but I don't think it's the right thing
for you to do.

627
00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:24.598
I stopped off at Attica today on my way
up here to see an old friend of mine.

628
00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:28.185
You have any friends not in jail?

629
00:45:29.394 --> 00:45:31.146
Not as many as I would like.

630
00:45:32.356 --> 00:45:33.815
What's he in for?

631
00:45:35.192 --> 00:45:39.279
Triple murder.
He killed three men about 15 years ago.

632
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.615
And he's a good friend?

633
00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:44.159
He was my best friend.

634
00:45:46.203 --> 00:45:47.871
We hung out together.

635
00:45:48.038 --> 00:45:50.791
We were close,
just like you and the guys.

636
00:46:02.803 --> 00:46:04.513
We were both sent up here.

637
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:09.393
That's right.

638
00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:13.605
And it wasn't easy…

639
00:46:14.523 --> 00:46:17.442
… just like it's not easy
for you and the guys.

640
00:46:19.236 --> 00:46:23.740
This place killed him,
made him not care anymore.

641
00:46:27.744 --> 00:46:29.913
Don't let this place
do that to you, Shakes.

642
00:46:30.998 --> 00:46:34.376
Don't let it make you think
you're tougher than you are.

643
00:46:35.085 --> 00:46:37.337
I gotta go, Father.

644
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.597
I'll see you in the kitchen. Hmm?

645
00:46:48.265 --> 00:46:50.434
I'm counting on you, now.

646
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.062
Wipe the tears off your face.
Don't let them see it.

647
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.982
Don't let them see you crying.

648
00:46:57.316 --> 00:46:59.651
Don't give them the satisfaction.

649
00:47:02.112 --> 00:47:04.031
You'll be out of here before you know it.

650
00:47:07.701 --> 00:47:08.994
You're gonna be okay.

651
00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:17.961
<i>I didn't want to let him go.</i>

652
00:47:18.128 --> 00:47:21.631
<i>I never felt as close to anyone
as I felt to him at that moment.</i>

653
00:47:28.096 --> 00:47:31.099
<i>A number of the inmates,
as tough as they acted during the day…</i>

654
00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:33.685
<i>… would often cry themselves
to sleep at night.</i>

655
00:47:33.935 --> 00:47:35.896
<i>There were other cries too.</i>

656
00:47:36.063 --> 00:47:38.732
<i>These differed from those filled
with fear and loneliness.</i>

657
00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:43.779
<i>They were lower and muffled,
the sounds of pained anguish.</i>

658
00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:47.074
<i>Those cries can change
the course of a life.</i>

659
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.702
<i>They are cries that, once heard,
can never be erased from memory.</i>

660
00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:53.914
<i>On this one night,
those cries belonged to my friend, John…</i>

661
00:47:54.081 --> 00:47:56.875
<i>… when Ralph Ferguson paid him a visit.</i>

662
00:48:12.766 --> 00:48:15.811
<i>I was expecting to read
30 book reports over the weekend.</i>

663
00:48:15.977 --> 00:48:20.148
There are only six for me to read,
which means I'm missing how many?

664
00:48:21.066 --> 00:48:24.277
Ha, ha. Man, this is English class.
Math is down the hall.

665
00:48:28.323 --> 00:48:29.658
I want to help you.

666
00:48:29.825 --> 00:48:34.371
You may not believe that
or you may not care, but it's the truth.

667
00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:44.339
- You got a second?
- What, I do something wrong?

668
00:48:44.506 --> 00:48:47.509
No. You did a great job
on your book report.

669
00:48:49.219 --> 00:48:52.180
You really seemed to like the book,
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo.</i>

670
00:48:52.347 --> 00:48:55.725
It's my favorite.
I liked it more since I've been in here.

671
00:48:56.351 --> 00:48:57.644
Why is that?

672
00:48:58.687 --> 00:49:03.024
It's like he wouldn't
let anyone beat him, the count.

673
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:07.779
Took what he had to take,
the beatings, insults and whatever.

674
00:49:07.946 --> 00:49:10.031
And he learned from it.

675
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:14.286
Then when the time came for him to
do something, he made his move.

676
00:49:15.078 --> 00:49:18.874
- You admire that?
- No, I respect that.

677
00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:21.585
You got a copy of the book at home?

678
00:49:22.419 --> 00:49:24.212
I got the Classics Illustrated comic.

679
00:49:25.297 --> 00:49:26.923
No, it's not the same thing.

680
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.301
I gotta go.
I'm gonna miss morning roll call.

681
00:49:29.468 --> 00:49:32.929
Wait, wait, wait. One minute, one minute.
I've got something for you.

682
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:37.559
- Thought you might like to have it.
- Are you serious?

683
00:49:37.726 --> 00:49:40.979
Well, you love the book that
much, you should have a copy of your own.

684
00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:44.566
- I can't pay you.
- No, it's a gift.

685
00:49:44.733 --> 00:49:48.153
- You've gotten gifts before, haven't you?
- It's been a while.

686
00:49:48.445 --> 00:49:50.447
Well, it's my way of saying thanks.

687
00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:52.073
For what?

688
00:49:52.949 --> 00:49:55.494
That somebody listens,
even if it's just one student.

689
00:49:56.536 --> 00:49:57.996
You're a good teacher.

690
00:49:58.163 --> 00:50:02.167
We can discuss the book in class if you
think the count can hold their attention.

691
00:50:02.626 --> 00:50:03.668
He's got a shot.

692
00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:06.421
Any particular section
I should read from?

693
00:50:06.588 --> 00:50:10.133
That's easy.
The part where he escapes from prison.

694
00:50:22.812 --> 00:50:26.149
Here you go, all-star.
Here's your locker room.

695
00:50:33.031 --> 00:50:38.286
<i>It was only a game,
just a touch football game, nothing more.</i>

696
00:50:38.453 --> 00:50:40.914
<i>But a game I wish we had never played.</i>

697
00:50:41.122 --> 00:50:45.669
<i>Guards against inmates.
The guards practiced four times a week.</i>

698
00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:48.630
<i>Our team was picked
the Monday before the game.</i>

699
00:50:48.797 --> 00:50:50.966
<i>We had a two-hour practice.</i>

700
00:50:51.132 --> 00:50:52.384
<i>It didn't matter much.</i>

701
00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:56.346
<i>We weren't supposed to win.
We were just supposed to show up.</i>

702
00:50:56.513 --> 00:50:58.807
Who's the toughest guy out here?

703
00:50:58.974 --> 00:51:02.060
- How do you mean, tough?
- Who can talk and have everyone listen?

704
00:51:02.227 --> 00:51:05.313
Rizzo. Black kid over there.

705
00:51:06.439 --> 00:51:09.943
<i>Michael saw an opening,
a chance to bring the game to our level.</i>

706
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:14.656
<i>Even out the field.
But he needed help. He needed Rizzo.</i>

707
00:51:14.823 --> 00:51:20.036
<i>Black kid with an Italian name.
With Rizzo on our side, we had a chance.</i>

708
00:51:20.245 --> 00:51:23.665
Look, white boy, I don't know
what you play in the streets. I don't care.

709
00:51:23.832 --> 00:51:25.584
But in here, the guards call the play.

710
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.877
- The play calls for them to win the game.
- Why?

711
00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:29.546
Look, man…

712
00:51:29.713 --> 00:51:33.049
… guards steer clear of me, all right?
Stay back and let me do my time.

713
00:51:33.216 --> 00:51:36.928
I play that game, put a hurt on one of them,
they just might change my cushion.

714
00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:40.557
<i>I'm not saying we gotta
win. I just don't want to take a beating.</i>

715
00:51:40.724 --> 00:51:41.766
<i>You do every day.</i>

716
00:51:42.517 --> 00:51:46.062
- Why is Saturday special?
- Because on Saturday, we can hit back.

717
00:51:47.397 --> 00:51:48.648
Really?

718
00:51:48.815 --> 00:51:52.193
They don't fuck with you like they do us.
They fuck with you another way.

719
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.029
You're just an animal to them.

720
00:51:54.529 --> 00:51:57.115
- I don't give a fuck.
- Yeah, you do.

721
00:51:57.282 --> 00:52:00.410
And beating them on Saturday,
it's not gonna change a thing.

722
00:52:00.869 --> 00:52:02.287
Then why, white boy, why?

723
00:52:02.454 --> 00:52:07.167
To make them feel what we feel,
just for a couple of hours.

724
00:52:08.877 --> 00:52:10.712
Now, don't try anything funny, Sambo.

725
00:52:10.879 --> 00:52:13.298
Nobody will get hurt.
You know what I'm saying?

726
00:52:13.465 --> 00:52:14.507
I call heads.

727
00:52:14.674 --> 00:52:16.760
He calls heads.

728
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.305
He called heads. It is a head.

729
00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.308
- Let's go.
- Go.

730
00:52:32.651 --> 00:52:36.321
You're gonna die, motherfucker.
You're gonna fucking die.

731
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:48.875
None of you motherfuckers can cover me!

732
00:52:49.042 --> 00:52:52.545
We got ourselves a game.
I'm feeling good today.

733
00:52:52.712 --> 00:52:54.547
This shit feels good.

734
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:08.144
Oh, fuck!

735
00:53:08.311 --> 00:53:09.896
Get the fuck off of me!

736
00:53:17.112 --> 00:53:18.154
Yeah!

737
00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:26.162
- Yeah, keep smiling, you little pissant.
- Yeah.

738
00:53:27.497 --> 00:53:30.625
<i>For 90 minutes,
we took the game out of the prison…</i>

739
00:53:30.792 --> 00:53:32.794
<i>… moved it miles
beyond the locked gates…</i>

740
00:53:32.961 --> 00:53:35.630
<i>… and the sloping hills
of the surrounding countryside…</i>

741
00:53:35.797 --> 00:53:39.467
<i>… and brought it back down to the streets
of the neighborhoods we'd come from.</i>

742
00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:43.138
<i>For those 90 minutes,
we were once again free.</i>

743
00:53:58.737 --> 00:54:01.322
<i>Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!</i>

744
00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:04.117
<i>Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!</i>

745
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:07.829
<i>Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!</i>

746
00:54:07.996 --> 00:54:11.040
<i>Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!</i>

747
00:54:11.207 --> 00:54:14.502
<i>Rizzo! Rizzo! Rizzo!</i>

748
00:54:14.669 --> 00:54:19.299
Rizzo. Rizzo.

749
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:22.385
<i>- Rizzo.</i>
- Hey, Nokes.

750
00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:24.512
Good game.

751
00:54:26.389 --> 00:54:32.437
<i>For once, we had a victory,
but it didn't last. It couldn't last.</i>

752
00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:35.523
<i>And all I wanted to do was die.</i>

753
00:54:35.857 --> 00:54:40.361
<i>I was not alone in the hole. I knew my
friends were down in the depths with me.</i>

754
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:45.074
<i>Each in his own cell, each in his own pain,
suffering his own demons.</i>

755
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:46.785
<i>Rizzo was there too.</i>

756
00:54:49.454 --> 00:54:52.040
I had lost any sense of time.

757
00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:33.957
I thought you'd never wake up.

758
00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:35.792
I thought I'd never want to.

759
00:55:36.334 --> 00:55:40.213
John and Tommy,
they're on the other side there.

760
00:55:41.047 --> 00:55:42.674
How are they?

761
00:55:43.925 --> 00:55:45.593
They're alive.

762
00:55:46.386 --> 00:55:47.637
Who isn't?

763
00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:51.140
Rizzo.

764
00:55:53.059 --> 00:55:54.435
They killed him?

765
00:55:56.271 --> 00:56:01.568
They took turns beating him until
there was nothing of that kid to beat.

766
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.699
<i>Rizzo was dead because of us.</i>

767
00:56:08.199 --> 00:56:12.078
<i>We made him think that going up against
the guards in a meaningless football game…</i>

768
00:56:12.245 --> 00:56:16.291
<i>… had some value,
that it would give us a reason to go on.</i>

769
00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:19.377
<i>Once again, we were wrong.</i>

770
00:56:20.795 --> 00:56:22.714
<i>They give you your release date yet?</i>

771
00:56:22.881 --> 00:56:24.841
<i>Nokes had a letter from the warden.</i>

772
00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:28.052
Waved it in front of me
and then tore it up.

773
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:30.054
When do you figure?

774
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:33.808
I don't know.
End of spring, early summer or something.

775
00:56:34.142 --> 00:56:36.477
I wish we were coming with you.

776
00:56:36.728 --> 00:56:40.106
Would have been nice for all of us
to walk out together, you know?

777
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.402
No use thinking about that.
We're gonna do a full year, not an hour less.

778
00:56:45.987 --> 00:56:49.198
When I get out, I could get Father Bobby
to make a couple phone calls.

779
00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:50.533
Shave a month or two off.

780
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.037
- There's nothing to talk about.
- There's a lot to talk about.

781
00:56:54.203 --> 00:56:57.498
Maybe if people knew what was going on
in here, they'd make a move.

782
00:56:57.665 --> 00:56:59.834
I don't want anybody to know.

783
00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:07.008
Not Father Bobby, King Benny, Fat Mancho,
not my mother. Nobody.

784
00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:12.221
Yeah, I don't either. I mean, I wouldn't know
what to say to anyone who did know.

785
00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:15.350
I can't think of anybody
who needs to hear about it.

786
00:57:15.516 --> 00:57:19.604
I mean, either they won't believe it
or they won't give a shit.

787
00:57:19.771 --> 00:57:23.483
Yeah, I don't even think we should talk
about it once it's over, you know?

788
00:57:24.359 --> 00:57:29.364
We got no choice but to live with it.
And talking makes living it harder.

789
00:57:29.781 --> 00:57:32.450
So we might as well
not even talk about it.

790
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.869
The truth stays with us.

791
00:57:37.622 --> 00:57:40.249
I want to be able to sleep one night…

792
00:57:40.792 --> 00:57:44.295
… and not have to worry who's coming
in my room, what's gonna happen to me.

793
00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:49.926
If I can get that…

794
00:57:51.052 --> 00:57:53.346
… then I'll be happy.

795
00:57:54.889 --> 00:57:58.768
Someday, John, I promise.

796
00:58:14.367 --> 00:58:18.204
<i>I was in my last hours as
an inmate at the Wilkinson Home for Boys.</i>

797
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:23.793
<i>I was given four copies of my release form,
the final reminder of my time at Wilkinson.</i>

798
00:58:25.378 --> 00:58:30.591
<i>I never heard the key turn in the lock
and I never heard the snap of the bolt.</i>

799
00:58:31.426 --> 00:58:33.594
You should be asleep.

800
00:58:34.137 --> 00:58:36.681
I just wanted to say goodbye.

801
00:58:37.306 --> 00:58:39.100
We all do.

802
00:58:40.977 --> 00:58:42.729
I told him right to his face. I said:

803
00:58:42.895 --> 00:58:46.691
"I don't care if you pay me overtime or not.
I'm not working those kind of hours."

804
00:58:46.858 --> 00:58:48.985
- Did you put in for it?
- Yeah, I put in for it.

805
00:58:49.152 --> 00:58:51.654
Because I put in for it
and they didn't give it to me.

806
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:55.283
I come in early, three days.
Do they give me overtime? No.

807
00:58:56.284 --> 00:58:59.120
<i>A part of all of us
was left there that night.</i>

808
00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:02.165
<i>A night that will never be removed
from my mind.</i>

809
00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:07.795
<i>The night of June 1, 1968,
the summer of love.</i>

810
00:59:08.463 --> 00:59:11.382
<i>My last night at the
Wilkinson Home for Boys.</i>

811
00:59:57.178 --> 01:00:00.515
<i>At 8:25 p.m.
two men walked through the doors.</i>

812
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:04.102
<i>The bartender knew their faces.
Most of the neighborhood knew their names.</i>

813
01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:07.021
<i>They were two of the founding members
of the West Side Boys.</i>

814
01:00:07.188 --> 01:00:09.565
<i>They were also its deadliest.</i>

815
01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:13.903
<i>The blond-haired man had been in and out
of jail since he was a teenager.</i>

816
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.823
<i>He robbed and killed at will
or on command.</i>

817
01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:20.076
<i>He's presently a suspect
in four unsolved homicides.</i>

818
01:00:20.243 --> 01:00:24.288
<i>He was an alcoholic and a cocaine abuser
with a fast temper and a faster trigger.</i>

819
01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:28.084
<i>He once shot a mechanic dead
for moving ahead of him in a movie line.</i>

820
01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.337
<i>The dark-haired man was
equally deadly…</i>

821
01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:34.549
<i>… and had committed his first murder
at the age of 17.</i>

822
01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:37.093
<i>In return, he was paid $50.</i>

823
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.553
<i>He drank and he did drugs…</i>

824
01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:42.932
<i>… and he had a wife he never saw
living somewhere in Queens.</i>

825
01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:47.937
He's making a noble attempt
to really change things.

826
01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:51.607
- The Republicans will take the House.
- Well, we got a lot of work to do.

827
01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:54.986
- It'll take more than four years—
- They'll take it at the elections.

828
01:00:55.153 --> 01:00:58.114
He's got the charisma. He's gonna do it.

829
01:00:58.281 --> 01:01:00.867
He's our man.
Reagan's the man who's gonna do it.

830
01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:05.163
- Hey, Jerry. What are they talking about?
- Huh?

831
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:08.374
They're talking about Reagan's speech.

832
01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:13.129
Order those two men some drinks
and put it on my tab.

833
01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:14.630
- And Jerry?
- Yeah.

834
01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:17.758
Tell them that Republicans
are not welcome in Hell's Kitchen…

835
01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:21.721
… and either a political conversion
or a change of conversation is in order.

836
01:01:21.888 --> 01:01:22.930
Sure thing.

837
01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:29.687
Yeah?

838
01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:32.940
The gentlemen there would like
to buy you a drink on one condition.

839
01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:37.195
You know the rules:
no religion, no politics.

840
01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.363
You get my meaning?

841
01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:48.414
<i>Henderson with the miss,
Bird underneath…</i>

842
01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:50.583
<i>… he gets the garbage and scores.</i>

843
01:01:56.172 --> 01:01:58.716
Order something for me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

844
01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:31.624
Can I help you with something, chief?

845
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.210
Not right now.

846
01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.421
Enjoy the rest of your meal.

847
01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:26.721
I, uh, I ordered the brisket
on a roll with fries…

848
01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:29.640
… and, uh, two baskets of soda bread.

849
01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:32.226
I know how you like that shit.

850
01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:34.228
Is that okay by you?

851
01:03:35.688 --> 01:03:39.775
Take a look at the guy at the table.
Take a good look.

852
01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:52.705
Motherfucker.

853
01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:19.982
That's him.

854
01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:22.485
Are you fucking kidding me?

855
01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.322
Bingo.

856
01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.307
This is amazing.

857
01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.768
Hello. It's been a long time.

858
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:59.313
Who the fuck are you guys?

859
01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.149
Hey.

860
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.402
Who the fuck asked you to sit down?

861
01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:08.447
I thought you'd be happy to see us.
I guess I was wrong.

862
01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:12.159
You know,
I thought you'd do a lot better, you know?

863
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.496
You know, with all that training,
all that time you put in…

864
01:05:15.663 --> 01:05:18.999
… just to end up watching someone else's
money. That seems like a waste.

865
01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.335
I'm asking for the last time,
what do you want?

866
01:05:21.502 --> 01:05:24.463
Why don't you take your time?
It'll come to you.

867
01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:31.512
- I could see how he might forget us.
- Yeah.

868
01:05:31.679 --> 01:05:34.473
We were just something for you
and your friends to play with.

869
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:40.729
It's a little harder for us to forget.
You gave us so much more to remember.

870
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.483
Can't quite place us, can you, chief?

871
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.735
Let me help you out.

872
01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:50.114
You're looking at
John Reilly and Tommy Marcano.

873
01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:57.705
Oh, yeah.

874
01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:02.251
Yeah, that's right.

875
01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:10.426
That was a long time ago.

876
01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:14.263
So how you been?

877
01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.682
Yeah, we ain't kids now.

878
01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:18.976
Ah, so, what do you want?

879
01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:23.147
What I've always wanted
is to watch you die.

880
01:06:27.443 --> 01:06:28.903
Oh.

881
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.322
You ordered the meat loaf.

882
01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:35.117
The brisket's really good here,
only you'll never know it.

883
01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:37.578
You fucked up.

884
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.344
You were scared little pricks…

885
01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.846
… both of you.

886
01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:58.140
All of you, ha, ha…

887
01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:02.102
… scared shitless. But I—

888
01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:06.565
I tried to make you tough.
I tried to make you hard.

889
01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:08.317
I had you all wrong, then, Nokes.

890
01:07:08.484 --> 01:07:12.029
All this time, I thought you just liked
fucking and beating up little boys.

891
01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:15.991
You two motherfuckers are gonna burn
in hell. You're gonna burn in hell.

892
01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:18.327
Yeah, after you.

893
01:07:23.123 --> 01:07:25.334
Did that hurt, Nokes?

894
01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.455
Jerry.

895
01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:07.334
Sorry, should have made
those brisket sandwiches to go.

896
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:14.216
- Jesus!
- Aah!

897
01:08:18.762 --> 01:08:20.264
<i>John Reilly, how do you plead?</i>

898
01:08:20.431 --> 01:08:22.308
<i>Not guilty, Your Honor.</i>

899
01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:24.393
<i>Thomas Marcano?</i>

900
01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.520
<i>Not guilty, Your Honor.</i>

901
01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:30.941
<i>John Reilly and Thomas Marcano,
you are hereby held without bail.</i>

902
01:08:31.567 --> 01:08:35.154
<i>In all the years since Wilkinson's,
we had never once spoken to each other…</i>

903
01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:36.947
<i>… about what had happened there.</i>

904
01:08:37.114 --> 01:08:41.910
<i>We remained caring friends,
but the relationship had been altered.</i>

905
01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:46.206
<i>We drifted together, always wondering
if that moment would arrive…</i>

906
01:08:46.373 --> 01:08:48.542
<i>… that would force us
to deal with the past.</i>

907
01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.932
One down, Shakes.

908
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.643
One down.

909
01:09:07.186 --> 01:09:08.854
One what?

910
01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:14.068
One Sean Nokes.

911
01:09:14.735 --> 01:09:16.278
Nokes?

912
01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:25.412
<i>At the time of Nokes' shooting…</i>

913
01:09:25.579 --> 01:09:28.666
<i>… Michael was working as an
Assistant New York District Attorney.</i>

914
01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:32.336
<i>I got a call that he wanted to meet me
on 45th Street in Queens.</i>

915
01:09:32.503 --> 01:09:34.338
<i>Then he hung up.</i>

916
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.759
Hey. So, what did they say?

917
01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:40.844
- What?
- John and Tommy. What did they say?

918
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:43.681
- It's a little cloak and dagger, isn't it, Mike?
- Come on.

919
01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:46.558
Nokes. Did they talk about him?

920
01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:49.603
- John did.
- Yeah?

921
01:09:49.937 --> 01:09:51.397
What did he say?

922
01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:55.150
He said, "One down, Shakes. One down."

923
01:09:57.778 --> 01:10:00.489
- They hired Danny Snyder as the lawyer?
- It's temporary.

924
01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:04.034
- King Benny will move in one of his lawyers.
- No, don't let him do that.

925
01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:06.662
- Snyder's perfect.
- The guy's a fall-down drunk.

926
01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:10.499
- I'm telling you, he's perfect.
- Perfect for what?

927
01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:15.921
- You covering this for your newspaper?
- Me?

928
01:10:16.088 --> 01:10:18.632
- Yeah.
- I'm a timetable clerk, Mikey.

929
01:10:18.799 --> 01:10:22.928
Ask me what movie's playing at what time.
I'm lucky they let me in the building.

930
01:10:26.807 --> 01:10:27.933
Get some coffee?

931
01:10:28.726 --> 01:10:30.477
Let's take a walk.

932
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.449
I'm gonna prosecute John
and Tommy in an open court.

933
01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:47.327
- What, are you fucking nuts?
- Hey, just hear me out.

934
01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:50.247
You should stay home tomorrow.
Call in sick, save your life.

935
01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.916
I'm not taking this case to win.

936
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.128
I'm taking this case to lose.

937
01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:59.006
- What does that mean?
- Ha, ha.

938
01:11:00.007 --> 01:11:02.301
It means it's payback time.

939
01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:07.514
Look, John and Tommy started this.
It's begun.

940
01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:12.019
It's messy, it's not how I had it planned,
but here it is.

941
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:15.564
And you and I, we can finish it.

942
01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:17.524
Finish what, Mike?

943
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.779
You read
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> lately?

944
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.866
I don't know. Ten years ago.

945
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.912
You see, I read a little bit
of it every night.

946
01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:35.292
I read words like "revenge."
Sweet lasting revenge.

947
01:11:36.502 --> 01:11:38.504
Payback time.

948
01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:41.632
It's our time.

949
01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:43.425
What are you saying, Mike?

950
01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:47.387
I'm saying it's time
for all of us to get a taste.

951
01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:51.058
I'm saying it's time
to put an end to this.

952
01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.561
Let's walk.

953
01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:01.568
I asked for the case. I told them I was from
the same neighborhood as the accused…

954
01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:03.612
… knew the mentality of the area.
Blah, blah.

955
01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:05.280
They bought it.

956
01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.741
And the connection between John,
Tommy and Nokes?

957
01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:11.745
What connection? All juvenile records
are destroyed after seven years.

958
01:12:11.912 --> 01:12:13.831
We were never at Wilkinson's.

959
01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:20.671
We gotta go after the guards.
I gotta get Wilkinson's.

960
01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:22.422
Bring it all down.

961
01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:25.926
Adam Styler, plain-clothes cop,
works Narcotics in Queens.

962
01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:29.763
Known to shake down dealers for dope
and cash. He's got a cocaine problem.

963
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.598
Other personal information there.

964
01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:35.102
Henry Addison, now works for the mayor,
if you can fucking believe that.

965
01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:37.604
He's a Community Outreach Director
in Brooklyn.

966
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:41.608
His sexual habits haven't changed.
He still likes sex with young boys.

967
01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:45.279
Ralph Ferguson, works in a
Social Service agency in Long Island.

968
01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.490
- How long you been working on this?
- Recently divorced, one child.

969
01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:51.034
And on weekends,
teaches Catholic Sunday school.

970
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:55.581
- Well, it seems clean, then, right?
- That's exactly why I want the piece of shit.

971
01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:58.083
Plan is to call Ferguson in
as a character witness.

972
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.794
Get him talking about his best friend,
Sean Nokes.

973
01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:04.882
Once I got him on the stand,
I'm gonna open the door to Wilkinson's.

974
01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:07.009
Mike…

975
01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:10.679
… are you sure you want to go this way?

976
01:13:13.265 --> 01:13:16.101
I mean, we buried this a long time ago.

977
01:13:17.853 --> 01:13:20.314
Do you still sleep with the light on?

978
01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:28.071
John and Tommy, do you want them
to know anything about this?

979
01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:31.158
No, it'll play better in court
if they don't know.

980
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:46.423
<i>The not-guilty verdict had to be
a verdict that no one would dare question.</i>

981
01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:49.551
<i>Danny Snyder was to remain
as Tommy and John's attorney.</i>

982
01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:53.347
<i>Michael's plan relied heavily
on Hell's Kitchen…</i>

983
01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:55.390
<i>… to deliver information and keep quiet.</i>

984
01:13:55.557 --> 01:13:58.143
<i>Both were skills the neighborhood
had in abundance.</i>

985
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:00.520
<i>We'd set up a simple method
of communication.</i>

986
01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:03.148
<i>If Michael was sending,
messages were left at work…</i>

987
01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:05.734
<i>… for me to call
my nonexistent girlfriend, Gloria.</i>

988
01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:09.279
<i>To get word to Michael,
I'd have someone from the neighborhood…</i>

989
01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:11.698
<i>… pick up an edition of</i>
The New York Times…

990
01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:14.993
<i>… write the word "Edmund"
in the corner of the Metro section…</i>

991
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.871
<i>… and drop it in front
of Michael's apartment.</i>

992
01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:26.546
<i>For this to succeed, we needed total secrecy
of the only people we completely trusted.</i>

993
01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:28.674
<i>The plan depended on keeping
Michael alive.</i>

994
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.095
<i>Meant word had to get to John and Tommy's
killing crew that he was not an open target.</i>

995
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:36.640
<i>After this night,
Michael would not be available to any of us.</i>

996
01:14:36.807 --> 01:14:39.559
<i>The only time we would see him
would be in court.</i>

997
01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:41.937
- That's it?
- Not quite.

998
01:14:42.104 --> 01:14:44.815
Four witnesses who saw the shooting
are willing to testify.

999
01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:46.400
Gotta get that number down.

1000
01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:49.736
- I'll talk to King Benny.
- Good.

1001
01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:53.532
I can handle two,
but, uh, you gotta get us one for our side.

1002
01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:56.326
- One of what?
- One witness.

1003
01:14:56.493 --> 01:15:00.205
A witness who'll put John and Tommy
somewhere else on the night of the murder.

1004
01:15:00.372 --> 01:15:01.957
A witness they can't touch.

1005
01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.335
Don't they got a name for that?

1006
01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:08.672
- A judge would call it perjury.
- Oh, nice.

1007
01:15:08.839 --> 01:15:12.300
- And what are we calling it?
- A favor.

1008
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.805
Get up. Come on.

1009
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.351
- Tony.
- Yeah, King?

1010
01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.687
Bring Danny Snyder to see me.

1011
01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:25.272
Who, Danny Snyder, the lawyer?

1012
01:15:25.439 --> 01:15:28.275
- You know more than one Danny Snyder?
- No, King.

1013
01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:30.610
Bring me the one you know.

1014
01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.341
I can't do this now. You gotta
know that. It's been a long time for me.

1015
01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:59.181
I mean, you need somebody younger.
You know, somebody like I used to be.

1016
01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:01.141
Younger is not better.

1017
01:16:01.308 --> 01:16:04.853
Doesn't have experience,
doesn't know its way around a courthouse.

1018
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.064
Hey, I'm lucky I can find the courthouse.

1019
01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:12.903
I had only four cases last year.
You know how many I won?

1020
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:16.698
None. That's how many, none.

1021
01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:22.120
In two of them,
I, uh, think the jury blamed me personally.

1022
01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:24.706
They must've been innocent.

1023
01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:28.168
It's tough to get innocent men off a rap.

1024
01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:30.587
Wasn't even planning on going
to court with this.

1025
01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:33.590
I was just gonna plea it down
best I could and walk away.

1026
01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:36.760
I wasn't planning on taking
this to trial, sir.

1027
01:16:36.927 --> 01:16:39.304
Well, your plans have been changed.

1028
01:16:39.471 --> 01:16:44.434
Well, I am afraid that I'll make a mistake
and say the wrong thing…

1029
01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:48.939
… make a wrong turn somewhere,
and you don't want to take that risk.

1030
01:16:49.106 --> 01:16:51.316
- Life is risk.
- I'm sorry.

1031
01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:53.318
Life is risk.

1032
01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:55.403
Life is a risk?

1033
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:57.656
- Mm-hm.
- Uh-huh.

1034
01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:01.409
I haven't been in here before.

1035
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:04.538
What do you need me to do?

1036
01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:10.085
Listen, you're gonna be given the answers
and the questions.

1037
01:17:10.252 --> 01:17:14.589
All you have to do is read.
You can read, can't you?

1038
01:17:14.756 --> 01:17:16.049
Is it in English?

1039
01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:20.011
Just don't drift,
don't drink and don't lose.

1040
01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:22.222
What if I do lose?

1041
01:17:22.389 --> 01:17:25.016
Then you go down for the dirt nap.

1042
01:17:25.851 --> 01:17:28.436
Never heard that expression before.

1043
01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:30.856
Dirt nap.

1044
01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:34.776
I'm not really cut out for this anymore.

1045
01:17:34.943 --> 01:17:39.906
I mean, a guy gets hit by a bus,
you know, and sues, I like that.

1046
01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:44.411
Some lady, uh, slips in a supermarket,
I'm with her. A guy—

1047
01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:45.954
The discussion is over.

1048
01:17:46.121 --> 01:17:50.000
I'm an alcoholic. This is a murder case.
This isn't for me.

1049
01:17:50.167 --> 01:17:52.210
- It was once.
- Yes, but—

1050
01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:54.921
Before you let the drink lead.

1051
01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:59.676
Be sober by tomorrow.
And don't look so worried, Snyder.

1052
01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:03.430
You got nothing to lose,
just like the rest of us.

1053
01:18:03.597 --> 01:18:05.348
I don't want to be a burden to you…

1054
01:18:05.515 --> 01:18:09.060
… but, you know, aside or along with
my alcohol problem…

1055
01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:12.731
… I have a slight drug problem.
I mean, nothing big, just—

1056
01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:14.733
Go away.

1057
01:18:25.202 --> 01:18:27.162
<i>Within days of Michael taking the case…</i>

1058
01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:29.789
<i>… the West Side Boys got a visit
from King Benny.</i>

1059
01:18:29.956 --> 01:18:33.543
<i>The King requested that the verbal abuse
directed towards Michael continue.</i>

1060
01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:36.963
<i>Cries of "traitor" and "gutter-rat"
were heard up and down the avenue.</i>

1061
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:39.549
<i>But there was never to be
a death move against him.</i>

1062
01:18:39.716 --> 01:18:43.970
<i>The hit on Michael Sullivan, if there was to
be one, could only come from King Benny.</i>

1063
01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:46.640
<i>The underground word,
the only one that mattered…</i>

1064
01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:50.143
<i>… had spread through the streets
with the speed of a late-night bullet.</i>

1065
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.942
<i>King Benny's sleepers
were making their play.</i>

1066
01:18:57.108 --> 01:19:00.737
<i>"Sleepers" was a street name for anyone
who spent time in a juvenile facility.</i>

1067
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.458
Hey! You gonna pay for that,
you little prick?

1068
01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:17.671
I need your help, fat man.
Need a big favor. I'll be outside.

1069
01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:19.756
King Benny been to see you?

1070
01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:23.510
Oh, my goodness.
What a fucking thing we put together, huh?

1071
01:19:23.677 --> 01:19:28.223
You have a drunk lawyer on one side,
a kid lawyer on the other.

1072
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:31.685
Fucking paperboy
making like Dick Tracy.

1073
01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:35.730
There are four sets of eyeballs
that saw the whole thing.

1074
01:19:35.897 --> 01:19:38.942
Meanwhile, the two on trial
kill more people than cancer.

1075
01:19:39.109 --> 01:19:41.444
Fucking General Custer
has a better shot at a walk.

1076
01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.363
No connection with the guard and us.

1077
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.365
The cops think
it's a drug-related homicide.

1078
01:19:45.532 --> 01:19:47.409
We just need you to pull a few strings.

1079
01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:51.121
You know, if you get caught on this,
you're looking straight at serious.

1080
01:19:51.288 --> 01:19:54.040
I'm talking real jail. The big house.

1081
01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:02.424
They are not good boys anymore.

1082
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.845
They're killers now, cold as stone.

1083
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:12.350
I know. I know what they were and I know
what they are and it's not about that.

1084
01:20:13.018 --> 01:20:17.689
It's not worth it,
throwing away life just to get even.

1085
01:20:18.106 --> 01:20:20.108
You and the lawyer have a chance
to get out.

1086
01:20:20.275 --> 01:20:21.609
To get out the right way.

1087
01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:24.404
There's no choice. Not for us.

1088
01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:30.577
<i>On occasion, I'd have dinner with Carol.</i>

1089
01:20:30.744 --> 01:20:34.664
<i>She still lived in the neighborhood
and was a social worker in the South Bronx.</i>

1090
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:38.084
<i>Her concern for us was undiminished
by the passing years.</i>

1091
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:41.796
<i>Whenever we went out as a group, Carol
would walk between Michael and John…</i>

1092
01:20:41.963 --> 01:20:44.174
<i>… grasping their arms…</i>

1093
01:20:44.341 --> 01:20:46.426
<i>… in step between
the lawyer and the killer.</i>

1094
01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:50.638
Mug me or marry me, Shakes.
I'm too tired for anything else.

1095
01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:53.266
Would you settle for a couple beers,
Carol?

1096
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.145
If that's your best offer.

1097
01:20:58.563 --> 01:21:00.273
I'll throw in a hug and a kiss.

1098
01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:02.984
Deal.

1099
01:21:06.821 --> 01:21:07.989
<i>Oh, what a night</i>

1100
01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:11.409
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

1101
01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.870
They don't give you time to sleep
in this new job of yours?

1102
01:21:14.037 --> 01:21:17.791
<i>What a very special time for me</i>

1103
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.460
So how much do you know?

1104
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.296
Just what the neighborhood says.

1105
01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:26.132
And what I read in papers like yours.

1106
01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:27.884
What does the neighborhood say?

1107
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.928
They're gonna put Johnny
and Tommy away.

1108
01:21:30.095 --> 01:21:32.180
Their best friend's
gonna be the one to do it.

1109
01:21:32.347 --> 01:21:35.225
- You believe that?
- It's hard not to, Shakes.

1110
01:21:35.392 --> 01:21:39.938
Oh, unless we all have it wrong.
He did take the fucking case.

1111
01:21:40.105 --> 01:21:43.149
- He did take the case.
- What else is there to say?

1112
01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:49.155
You know Michael very well,
maybe even better than I do.

1113
01:21:49.322 --> 01:21:51.991
Yeah, I thought I did. Now I don't know.

1114
01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:54.327
- You do know.
- I don't know!

1115
01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:55.995
He went and asked for the case.

1116
01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:58.998
Now, you tell me,
what the hell kind of friend is that?

1117
01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:01.334
The best kind.

1118
01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:04.170
The kind who'll throw away everything
to help his friends.

1119
01:22:04.337 --> 01:22:07.924
<i>Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me</i>

1120
01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:10.343
What are you telling me, Shakes?

1121
01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:15.014
You know this neighborhood, Carol.
Everything's a shakedown or a scam.

1122
01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.559
Why should this be any different?

1123
01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:24.732
I'm hungry.

1124
01:22:25.525 --> 01:22:27.569
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1125
01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:32.532
There's this point in Michael
that you can't go beyond.

1126
01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:35.785
I mean, you can try. I tried.

1127
01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:39.205
And he just shut down.

1128
01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:42.417
Couldn't touch him,
couldn't even breathe on him.

1129
01:22:45.837 --> 01:22:47.172
I thought it was me.

1130
01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:49.174
<i>Though I never laid a hand on you</i>

1131
01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.593
After a while,
it just gets easier to let it go.

1132
01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:56.181
- You still love him?
- I don't think about it, Shakes.

1133
01:22:57.056 --> 01:22:59.476
If I did, I'd say yes.

1134
01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.352
But you're with John now.

1135
01:23:01.728 --> 01:23:07.400
Yeah, as much as anybody
can be with John.

1136
01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:10.069
The man I know isn't
the boy you remember.

1137
01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:11.821
None of us are.

1138
01:23:12.572 --> 01:23:15.658
But there's something special
about John.

1139
01:23:16.326 --> 01:23:19.245
You just have to look a little harder
to see it.

1140
01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.080
Yeah.

1141
01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:25.627
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

1142
01:23:26.127 --> 01:23:28.254
- Me?
- Yeah.

1143
01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:31.257
Because you were Mikey's girl.

1144
01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:34.427
He got to you first.

1145
01:23:34.594 --> 01:23:36.721
And after Mikey?

1146
01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:40.683
- I think it was Tommy's turn.
- Oh, fuck you!

1147
01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:45.104
I don't know. It was…

1148
01:23:45.939 --> 01:23:49.567
… I didn't think you'd say yes and, uh—

1149
01:23:54.322 --> 01:23:55.865
Well, you were wrong, Shakes.

1150
01:23:57.909 --> 01:23:59.702
You were wrong.

1151
01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:07.210
What? Go ahead, say it.

1152
01:24:09.337 --> 01:24:13.383
You work at Social Services, you got files.
You got access to files.

1153
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:18.179
- From time to time, we'll need information.
- Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1154
01:24:18.346 --> 01:24:19.931
Wait. What?

1155
01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:23.851
What do you want? You want information?
You want me to get files, I'll get files.

1156
01:24:24.018 --> 01:24:27.272
- No, I didn't want. I didn't—
- What do you want?

1157
01:24:32.485 --> 01:24:34.362
You still visit John?

1158
01:24:34.529 --> 01:24:37.782
- Yeah, once a week for about an hour.
- Good.

1159
01:24:37.949 --> 01:24:39.993
- Good?
- Yeah, good.

1160
01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:43.329
Just don't tell him that you've seen me.
Don't tell him anything.

1161
01:24:43.496 --> 01:24:47.125
I mean, the more he thinks this thing's
hopeless, the better it might work.

1162
01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:50.461
Shakes, what is this about?

1163
01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:54.507
You want a Rolls-Royce,
you don't come here.

1164
01:24:54.674 --> 01:24:57.844
No, no. You go to England
or wherever the fuck they make it.

1165
01:24:58.011 --> 01:25:00.305
If you want champagne,
you go see the French.

1166
01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:02.515
If you need money, you find a Jew.

1167
01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:06.561
But if you want dirt or scum buried
under a rock somewhere…

1168
01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:10.773
… or some secret nobody wants anybody to
know about, there's only one place to go.

1169
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:15.695
Right here, Hell's Kitchen.
It is the lost and found of shit.

1170
01:25:15.862 --> 01:25:19.115
They lose it and we find it.
Forget about it, man.

1171
01:25:20.575 --> 01:25:24.078
Now you only got two witnesses
who are gonna testify.

1172
01:25:25.038 --> 01:25:26.831
Two others changed their minds.

1173
01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:31.085
- Which two?
- The suits at the bar.

1174
01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:36.049
- So that still leaves the couple in the booth?
- For now.

1175
01:25:37.091 --> 01:25:39.594
Everything else falling into place?

1176
01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:45.058
Except for your witness.
That pocket's still empty.

1177
01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.768
I know.

1178
01:25:50.897 --> 01:25:53.191
When you were sent away…

1179
01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:57.195
… I was always sorry
I couldn't do more for you.

1180
01:26:05.036 --> 01:26:07.080
I didn't know you liked
pigeons so much.

1181
01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:10.291
I like anything that don't talk.

1182
01:26:11.334 --> 01:26:14.212
<i>Michael's vision on where
he wanted this case to go was clear.</i>

1183
01:26:14.796 --> 01:26:16.130
<i>He was aiming for guilty.</i>

1184
01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:19.300
<i>A charge of guilty against the
Wilkinson Home for Boys…</i>

1185
01:26:19.467 --> 01:26:22.929
<i>… against Sean Nokes, Adam Styler,
Henry Addison and Ralph Ferguson.</i>

1186
01:26:23.096 --> 01:26:26.974
I will present to you evidence and
offer into account testimony to prove that.

1187
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.143
I will place them at the scene
of the crime.

1188
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:31.104
I will bring witnesses to the stand…

1189
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:34.148
… who will confirm that they were there
on that deadly night.

1190
01:26:34.565 --> 01:26:38.277
I will present enough evidence
that you can then go into a jury room…

1191
01:26:38.444 --> 01:26:42.240
… and come back with a clear decision
that's beyond a reasonable doubt.

1192
01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:46.869
I'm sure you all know what that means. You
probably watch as much television as I do.

1193
01:26:49.956 --> 01:26:54.544
John— John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
are two innocent pawns…

1194
01:26:54.711 --> 01:27:00.425
… quickly arrested
and just, uh, as quickly prosecuted…

1195
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.177
… on the slightest threads of evidence.

1196
01:27:03.344 --> 01:27:06.264
On the bright side,
he seems to know their names.

1197
01:27:06.431 --> 01:27:08.057
You and I know how things work.

1198
01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:20.111
It's nice when you come around.

1199
01:27:22.822 --> 01:27:25.491
Hey, bring me another spoon.
This one's dirty.

1200
01:27:25.658 --> 01:27:28.536
- Take it.
- No, no, she'll do it.

1201
01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:38.963
So how's work?

1202
01:27:40.757 --> 01:27:42.508
I'm still there.

1203
01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.347
You know, Pop, I, uh…

1204
01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:51.350
I went down to the courthouse.

1205
01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:54.437
John and Tommy.
You know, I saw John and Tommy.

1206
01:27:54.604 --> 01:27:56.731
I started thinking back
to when we were young—

1207
01:27:56.898 --> 01:27:58.733
Where's the chicken?

1208
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.738
So?

1209
01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:08.534
Nothing. I was just thinking things.

1210
01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:11.621
But you're doing good, right?

1211
01:28:12.205 --> 01:28:16.375
- Oh, yeah. I'm good.
- Good.

1212
01:28:58.125 --> 01:29:01.045
- What the hell do these things do?
- They're for praying.

1213
01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:02.588
Jesus, look at all this shit.

1214
01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:05.258
What, does your mother think
you're in the fucking Army?

1215
01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:08.970
- Ain't none of it on the approved list.
- Your mommy got a copy of that list.

1216
01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:11.347
<i>Mother can't speak English well.</i>

1217
01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:13.975
Don't blame us for your fucking mother
being stupid, all right?

1218
01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:21.649
When are you gonna let us
hear you pray?

1219
01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:33.578
He needs something to pray for.

1220
01:29:33.744 --> 01:29:36.163
Put your hands on the table
and lay them down flat.

1221
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.500
Spread your legs.

1222
01:29:40.501 --> 01:29:43.504
Now start thinking up some prayers.

1223
01:29:52.013 --> 01:29:53.055
We don't hear praying.

1224
01:29:53.222 --> 01:29:56.017
Better start or Styler
might lose his baton up your ass.

1225
01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:59.812
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1226
01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:01.480
<i>Pray nice and loud.</i>

1227
01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:05.192
<i>- Hail Mary, full of grace—
- Now louder.</i>

1228
01:30:05.359 --> 01:30:07.361
<i>Fucking, pray. Come on, now.</i>

1229
01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:11.240
- Louder!
- Hail Mary…

1230
01:30:12.658 --> 01:30:14.243
<i>Louder!</i>

1231
01:30:16.162 --> 01:30:17.830
Pray like you're in fucking church!

1232
01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:31.052
Sorry I'm late. I lost all track of time.

1233
01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:33.888
I got this idea for a witness,
but I'm not quite sure yet.

1234
01:30:34.055 --> 01:30:37.266
I want you to come along.
So you want to just—?

1235
01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:40.686
- Where are we going?
- To his place.

1236
01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:42.396
- Where is it?
- In the rectory.

1237
01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:44.523
No, Shakes.

1238
01:30:53.324 --> 01:30:55.201
How was court today?

1239
01:30:55.701 --> 01:31:00.831
Like the first round of a fight,
everybody just feeling each other out.

1240
01:31:01.624 --> 01:31:03.334
How did the boys look?

1241
01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:05.920
Like they wished
they were someplace else.

1242
01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:10.549
It's the sheep that stray
that you most want back.

1243
01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:14.387
It's not too late, Father.

1244
01:31:16.389 --> 01:31:19.642
Still have a chance to bring in
a couple stray sheep.

1245
01:31:20.226 --> 01:31:22.144
One more chance.

1246
01:31:23.854 --> 01:31:25.898
Is that chance legal?

1247
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.485
Last chances never are.

1248
01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:31.737
King Benny behind this?

1249
01:31:32.321 --> 01:31:35.366
He's in on it,
but, uh, he's not calling the shots.

1250
01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:37.076
Who is?

1251
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.412
Michael.

1252
01:31:40.997 --> 01:31:43.916
I should've smelled it.
The minute he went for the case…

1253
01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:45.960
… I should've figured something was up.

1254
01:31:46.127 --> 01:31:49.213
It's a good plan.
Michael's got it all covered.

1255
01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.591
Just about every base you look at,
he's got it covered.

1256
01:31:52.758 --> 01:31:54.760
Not every base.

1257
01:31:55.052 --> 01:31:57.722
You're short something
or else you wouldn't be here.

1258
01:31:57.888 --> 01:32:01.308
- You don't shit a shitter, right?
- That's right.

1259
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:06.272
So, what is it?
Where do you come up short?

1260
01:32:08.065 --> 01:32:09.275
Witness.

1261
01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:14.739
We need somebody to say they were with
John and Tommy on the night of the murder.

1262
01:32:14.905 --> 01:32:17.783
So you figured if you had a priest,
it would be perfect?

1263
01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:20.578
Not just any priest.

1264
01:32:27.043 --> 01:32:28.127
Hmm.

1265
01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:33.507
So you're—

1266
01:32:36.135 --> 01:32:37.970
You're asking me—

1267
01:32:39.472 --> 01:32:41.557
You're asking me to lie.

1268
01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:45.478
You're asking me to swear to God
and then lie.

1269
01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:48.439
I'm asking you to save two of your boys.

1270
01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:54.820
Did they kill that guard?

1271
01:32:56.447 --> 01:32:57.823
Yes.

1272
01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:01.952
So, what they said is true?
They walked in and they killed him?

1273
01:33:03.204 --> 01:33:04.663
Yes.

1274
01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:08.584
They killed him exactly like that.

1275
01:33:11.837 --> 01:33:13.798
I think I need a drink.

1276
01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:17.510
Anyone want a drink?

1277
01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:20.012
Yeah.

1278
01:33:35.194 --> 01:33:37.363
This is some favor you're asking me.

1279
01:33:38.447 --> 01:33:39.740
We know that.

1280
01:33:40.366 --> 01:33:42.827
No, I don't think you do know.

1281
01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:48.249
You said if there was ever anything really
important, I could come to you, ask you.

1282
01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:52.753
I was thinking more along the lines
of Yankee tickets.

1283
01:33:54.213 --> 01:33:59.093
I don't need Yankee tickets, Father.
I need a witness.

1284
01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:03.681
What about the life that was taken, Shakes?
What's that worth?

1285
01:34:03.848 --> 01:34:07.351
To me, nothing.

1286
01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:12.523
Why not? Tell me.

1287
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:19.738
He was a—

1288
01:34:21.073 --> 01:34:23.659
He was a guard at Wilkinson's.

1289
01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:27.454
All right?

1290
01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:31.667
<i>If Father Bobby was gonna be involved, he
deserved to know what he was getting into.</i>

1291
01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:35.421
<i>If he wasn't, I trusted that the truth
would go no further than his room.</i>

1292
01:34:36.547 --> 01:34:38.966
<i>I thought that Carol
needed to know as well.</i>

1293
01:34:39.383 --> 01:34:42.970
Jesus Christ, we were just boys.
You know, not tough.

1294
01:34:46.182 --> 01:34:47.349
They held us down.

1295
01:34:51.228 --> 01:34:55.107
<i>I told him about the torture,
the beatings and the rapes.</i>

1296
01:34:55.274 --> 01:34:57.318
<i>I told them about the four
frightened boys…</i>

1297
01:34:57.484 --> 01:35:00.905
<i>… who prayed to Father Bobby's God
for help that never came.</i>

1298
01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:02.156
<i>I told them everything.</i>

1299
01:35:02.323 --> 01:35:06.660
He can't fight anymore.
They just took it all. They just—

1300
01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:12.082
John used to wail at night,
hear it all the way down the hall.

1301
01:35:14.251 --> 01:35:17.421
You know he wanted to be a priest.
John wanted to be a priest.

1302
01:35:21.342 --> 01:35:26.096
Then he pulls his pants down.
I didn't even know what a blow job was.

1303
01:35:28.933 --> 01:35:33.270
I just sort of blacked out. What I could
remember is that I couldn't even breathe.

1304
01:35:34.104 --> 01:35:36.857
Then I started to choke.

1305
01:35:37.024 --> 01:35:39.902
He was pulling the hairs out
of the back of my head.

1306
01:35:41.946 --> 01:35:43.864
Then I blacked out.

1307
01:35:45.532 --> 01:35:50.955
But I do remember when, for fun,
they'd take us down in the basement…

1308
01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:53.123
… tie two or three of us together…

1309
01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:57.294
… and make the others watch as they
pulled down their pants and fucked them.

1310
01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:15.020
I got a decision to make.

1311
01:36:19.358 --> 01:36:21.777
I only pray it's the right one.

1312
01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.199
It will be, Father, whichever way you go.

1313
01:36:32.288 --> 01:36:33.455
Good night.

1314
01:36:42.256 --> 01:36:45.718
Okay, so you were sitting down,
you were having dinner…

1315
01:36:45.884 --> 01:36:48.304
- … and two men entered McHales, correct?
- Yes.

1316
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.765
Did you see the two men approach the table
where Mr. Nokes was sitting?

1317
01:36:51.932 --> 01:36:53.600
I noticed it, yes.

1318
01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:55.686
Did you hear what was said
between them?

1319
01:36:55.853 --> 01:36:56.937
Um, no.

1320
01:36:57.104 --> 01:36:58.897
Did you see them
pull out their guns?

1321
01:36:59.064 --> 01:37:00.816
- No.
- Did you hear the shots?

1322
01:37:01.567 --> 01:37:03.152
Yes, I heard the shots.

1323
01:37:03.319 --> 01:37:07.489
And what did they do?
What was their behavior after the shooting?

1324
01:37:08.449 --> 01:37:11.577
They walked out of McHales
as if nothing had happened.

1325
01:37:11.785 --> 01:37:16.707
And at that time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you see their faces clearly?

1326
01:37:17.458 --> 01:37:20.878
Yes. I looked up as they walked away.

1327
01:37:21.045 --> 01:37:24.048
- Are you positive?
- Yes, very positive.

1328
01:37:24.214 --> 01:37:26.925
And are the two men you saw in McHales
in this room today?

1329
01:37:27.092 --> 01:37:28.344
Yes, they are.

1330
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:30.929
Could you point them out
for the jury, please?

1331
01:37:31.513 --> 01:37:33.474
They're sitting right over there.

1332
01:37:34.016 --> 01:37:37.811
Your Honor, will the record reflect that
Mrs. Salinas has identified defendants…

1333
01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:41.357
… John Reilly and Thomas Marcano
as the two men in question.

1334
01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:44.568
- Noted.
- Thank you. No further questions.

1335
01:37:45.027 --> 01:37:47.863
Counsel, are you ready to proceed?

1336
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:49.490
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

1337
01:37:49.656 --> 01:37:51.658
Good morning.
I just have a few questions.

1338
01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:55.329
I won't take too much of your time,
Mrs. Salinas.

1339
01:37:55.496 --> 01:37:59.291
You stated that, uh, you only had wine
to drink with dinner.

1340
01:37:59.458 --> 01:38:00.459
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1341
01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:05.464
Are you sure about that? Are you sure
that was all you had, one bottle of wine?

1342
01:38:05.631 --> 01:38:07.716
Yes, a bottle of red Chianti.

1343
01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:11.053
Uh-huh.
Had you anything to drink prior to that?

1344
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.304
What do you mean, prior?

1345
01:38:12.471 --> 01:38:17.017
At, uh, lunch. Maybe did you have
anything to drink at lunch?

1346
01:38:17.184 --> 01:38:20.312
- Yes, I did.
- And what did you have to drink?

1347
01:38:20.479 --> 01:38:24.525
I went shopping and I, um, stopped at a
place on Madison Avenue for some lunch—

1348
01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:28.195
I didn't ask you where you went.
I asked you what you had to drink at lunch.

1349
01:38:29.363 --> 01:38:31.532
- A martini.
- And what else?

1350
01:38:33.492 --> 01:38:36.286
Um, probably some wine.

1351
01:38:36.453 --> 01:38:41.792
Yes, and, uh, how many glasses of wine
did you have to drink?

1352
01:38:41.959 --> 01:38:43.001
Um…

1353
01:38:43.252 --> 01:38:45.087
One glass, maybe two.

1354
01:38:45.838 --> 01:38:49.675
- Closer to two?
- Yes, probably two glasses. About two.

1355
01:38:49.842 --> 01:38:51.969
And did you, uh—?

1356
01:38:52.594 --> 01:38:54.012
Uh…

1357
01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.890
It's like pulling teeth.

1358
01:38:58.851 --> 01:39:01.603
I should've pinned the questions
to his shirt.

1359
01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:05.899
And tell me, then at dinner, you, uh—

1360
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.111
Strike that. Uh…

1361
01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:13.824
<i>What time did you have lunch?</i>

1362
01:39:15.784 --> 01:39:18.245
What time, Mrs. Salinas,
did you have lunch?

1363
01:39:18.412 --> 01:39:19.913
Objection, Your Honor.

1364
01:39:20.914 --> 01:39:22.541
What Mrs. Salinas did on the day…

1365
01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:25.127
… has nothing to do with
what she saw on the night.

1366
01:39:25.294 --> 01:39:27.296
How much she had to drink does,
Your Honor.

1367
01:39:27.463 --> 01:39:28.589
Overruled.

1368
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.969
Ahem. Mrs. Salinas,
what time, uh, did you have lunch?

1369
01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:35.679
About 1:30.

1370
01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:37.347
And what did you have for lunch?

1371
01:39:37.514 --> 01:39:42.519
It was a while ago. Um, probably a salad.
I like to eat a little light in the day.

1372
01:39:42.686 --> 01:39:45.939
A martini, two glasses of wine and a salad.
Is that correct?

1373
01:39:46.106 --> 01:39:47.733
Yes, that's right.

1374
01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:52.613
And then you had wine at dinner
about six hours later. Is that right?

1375
01:39:52.779 --> 01:39:55.491
- Yes, that's right.
- How much wine did you have to drink…

1376
01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:58.243
… by the time my clients allegedly
walked into McHales?

1377
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:02.915
- Two glasses.
- Would you say that four glasses of wine…

1378
01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:06.752
… and a martini within a six-hour period
is a lot for you to drink?

1379
01:40:07.336 --> 01:40:08.587
Yes, it is. Yes.

1380
01:40:08.754 --> 01:40:11.465
Aha. Sure.

1381
01:40:13.509 --> 01:40:19.556
And, uh, had you ever heard a gun fired
prior to the night in question?

1382
01:40:19.723 --> 01:40:20.974
No.

1383
01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:24.144
How would you describe the sound?

1384
01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:27.064
It was loud. Like fireworks loud.

1385
01:40:28.607 --> 01:40:32.611
- Did the sound, uh, frighten you?
- Very much.

1386
01:40:32.778 --> 01:40:35.405
Did you close your eyes?

1387
01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.785
At first, um, until the shooting stopped.
Then I opened them.

1388
01:40:39.952 --> 01:40:44.248
Did you think the men who did the shooting
were going to kill everybody in McHales?

1389
01:40:44.414 --> 01:40:48.627
Well, I really didn't know what to think.
I just knew that the man had been shot.

1390
01:40:48.794 --> 01:40:53.549
Did you think you might be shot dead
by the two cold-blooded killers?

1391
01:40:54.216 --> 01:40:55.259
Yes, yes, I did.

1392
01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:59.888
Yet despite that fear,
despite that risk to your life…

1393
01:41:00.055 --> 01:41:05.018
… you looked at their faces, uh,
as they left?

1394
01:41:05.185 --> 01:41:07.020
- Yes, I did.
- Is that correct?

1395
01:41:08.564 --> 01:41:09.648
Yes, I did.

1396
01:41:10.232 --> 01:41:16.572
Did you look at their faces?
Did you really, really look, Mrs. Salinas?

1397
01:41:17.573 --> 01:41:20.284
I glanced at them when they walked by,
but I did see them.

1398
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:24.621
You glanced? You didn't look?

1399
01:41:25.622 --> 01:41:26.832
I saw them.

1400
01:41:27.874 --> 01:41:31.837
You glanced at them, Mrs. Salinas.
You glanced at them through the eyes…

1401
01:41:32.004 --> 01:41:37.926
… of a very frightened woman
who maybe had too much to drink.

1402
01:41:38.093 --> 01:41:40.512
- Objection, Your Honor.
- No need, Your Honor.

1403
01:41:40.679 --> 01:41:42.306
I have no further questions.

1404
01:41:42.472 --> 01:41:45.809
Thank you, Mrs. Salinas.
You may step down.

1405
01:41:48.937 --> 01:41:51.231
<i>It was 6:15 on Sunday morning.</i>

1406
01:41:51.398 --> 01:41:54.526
<i>Frank Magcicco worked out of
a homicide unit in Brooklyn.</i>

1407
01:41:54.693 --> 01:41:58.113
<i>He was a first-grade detective
with an honest name and a solid reputation.</i>

1408
01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.240
<i>He was also King Benny's nephew.</i>

1409
01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:03.535
<i>Nick Davenport was with Internal Affairs.</i>

1410
01:42:03.702 --> 01:42:06.705
<i>He was ambitious and wanted
to make captain before he hit 40.</i>

1411
01:42:06.872 --> 01:42:10.834
<i>He knew the fastest way up the track was
to reel in a maximum amount of dirty cops…</i>

1412
01:42:11.001 --> 01:42:12.544
<i>… in a minimum amount of time.</i>

1413
01:42:12.711 --> 01:42:16.798
- Frank, what is this shit?
- Hey, if I were you, I'd do what the kid says.

1414
01:42:16.965 --> 01:42:19.968
Make this one, have breakfast once a month
with the commissioner.

1415
01:42:20.135 --> 01:42:23.722
You got a real hard-on for this Styler guy.
What's your beef with him?

1416
01:42:23.889 --> 01:42:25.891
- One more thing.
- Jeez, I can't wait.

1417
01:42:26.058 --> 01:42:29.811
It's simple. No one knows
who fed you this information.

1418
01:42:29.978 --> 01:42:32.022
- And I mean nobody.
- How did you get it?

1419
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:35.692
It fell into my lap,
just like it's gonna fall into yours.

1420
01:42:42.866 --> 01:42:44.910
Christ almighty.

1421
01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:53.293
Got everything in here but a confession.

1422
01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:55.212
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

1423
01:42:55.379 --> 01:42:58.924
- My preference is you beat it out of him.
- There's even surveillance photos.

1424
01:42:59.508 --> 01:43:02.594
Piece of shit's pulling in 5 grand a month
ripping off pushers.

1425
01:43:02.761 --> 01:43:04.221
Has been for about three years.

1426
01:43:04.388 --> 01:43:06.306
- More like four.
- He ain't gonna see five.

1427
01:43:06.473 --> 01:43:10.060
- So you got enough for conviction?
- That ain't up to me. That's up to a jury.

1428
01:43:13.772 --> 01:43:15.982
Show the jury this.

1429
01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:20.404
- What do you got there, Ness?
- Three weeks ago…

1430
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:23.490
… the body of a drug dealer
named Indian Red Lopez was found…

1431
01:43:23.657 --> 01:43:26.576
… in an alley in Jackson Heights.
Three bullets in his head…

1432
01:43:26.743 --> 01:43:28.870
- … nothing in his pockets.
- With you so far.

1433
01:43:29.037 --> 01:43:31.665
This is the gun that killed him
and these are the shells.

1434
01:43:32.165 --> 01:43:35.335
And, uh, what's behind
door number three?

1435
01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:38.463
The prints on the gun
belong to Adam Styler.

1436
01:43:42.384 --> 01:43:44.219
- Do me a favor, would you?
- What's that?

1437
01:43:44.386 --> 01:43:47.472
If I ever make it onto your shit list,
give me a call.

1438
01:43:47.639 --> 01:43:49.683
Give me a chance to apologize.

1439
01:43:50.434 --> 01:43:54.104
So you need anything else, you talk to
Frank. He knows how to get ahold of me.

1440
01:43:54.271 --> 01:43:57.899
Take care of yourself, kid.
Water gets choppy out your way.

1441
01:43:58.066 --> 01:43:59.484
I'll do what I can.

1442
01:44:00.694 --> 01:44:02.320
Hey, Ness…

1443
01:44:02.654 --> 01:44:04.990
… did you ever think of becoming a cop?

1444
01:44:05.282 --> 01:44:07.033
And leave the good guys?

1445
01:44:14.583 --> 01:44:16.084
The body of Christ.

1446
01:44:17.502 --> 01:44:19.379
The body of Christ.

1447
01:44:20.964 --> 01:44:22.841
The body of Christ.

1448
01:44:24.176 --> 01:44:26.344
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

1449
01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.807
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

1450
01:44:32.684 --> 01:44:34.978
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

1451
01:44:35.145 --> 01:44:37.147
The body of Chri—

1452
01:44:45.989 --> 01:44:47.491
Amen.

1453
01:44:50.202 --> 01:44:52.412
The body of Christ.

1454
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.167
<i>Michael had done all
that could be expected…</i>

1455
01:44:57.334 --> 01:45:00.712
<i>… of an assistant district attorney
seeking a conviction.</i>

1456
01:45:00.879 --> 01:45:05.675
<i>He had a forensic expert detail the make
and caliber of the gun that killed Nokes.</i>

1457
01:45:05.842 --> 01:45:08.637
<i>He just never had the murder weapon
to present as evidence…</i>

1458
01:45:08.804 --> 01:45:11.306
<i>… and he never gave the jury
a motive for the murder.</i>

1459
01:45:12.224 --> 01:45:14.601
<i>The tension of his task,
the hours he was working…</i>

1460
01:45:14.768 --> 01:45:17.729
<i>… and the uncertainty about the outcome
weighed heavily on him.</i>

1461
01:45:17.896 --> 01:45:19.022
Did you see their faces?

1462
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:22.317
Yes, I looked at them
and they looked at me.

1463
01:45:22.484 --> 01:45:23.902
Did they say anything to you?

1464
01:45:24.069 --> 01:45:26.321
They just looked at me
and walked out of McHales.

1465
01:45:26.488 --> 01:45:28.657
Are you sure the defendants
killed Sean Nokes?

1466
01:45:28.824 --> 01:45:30.534
I know they killed him.

1467
01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.453
<i>If the plan worked,
it would be everyone's success.</i>

1468
01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.997
<i>If it failed, the fault would fall to Michael.</i>

1469
01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:43.213
<i>Father Bobby Carrillo, the priest
with the best hook shot on the West Side…</i>

1470
01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:47.634
<i>… remained the key to a plan that called
for all involved to get away with murder.</i>

1471
01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:51.429
Did you turn around, look behind you,
when you heard the shooting, Mr. Carson?

1472
01:45:51.596 --> 01:45:53.223
Why didn't you turn around?

1473
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:57.269
- I was concerned for my companion's safety.
- Mr. Carson, did the two individuals…

1474
01:45:57.435 --> 01:45:59.104
- … threaten you in any way?
- No.

1475
01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:03.775
Did they threaten anyone in
McHales Restaurant, as far as you know?

1476
01:46:03.942 --> 01:46:05.443
I didn't see it, but I know it.

1477
01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:08.321
If you didn't see the defendants
shoot the guy…

1478
01:46:08.488 --> 01:46:12.576
<i>… then how do you know
it was the defendants that shot the guy?</i>

1479
01:46:34.472 --> 01:46:36.641
So, what's the emergency?

1480
01:46:40.103 --> 01:46:41.980
Shakes shouldn't have sent you.
Too risky.

1481
01:46:42.147 --> 01:46:46.610
Hey, nobody sent me.
I wanted to see you.

1482
01:46:47.903 --> 01:46:49.321
Why?

1483
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.033
Shakes met with Father Bobby
two weeks ago.

1484
01:46:53.199 --> 01:46:57.245
- He hasn't heard from him since.
- It's not an overnight decision for him.

1485
01:47:00.498 --> 01:47:04.502
- What if he doesn't testify?
- Then we got a very serious problem.

1486
01:47:19.434 --> 01:47:22.395
Have Shakes talk to Father Bobby again.

1487
01:47:23.313 --> 01:47:26.983
Have him tell him the whole story.
He'll know what that means.

1488
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.610
He already has.

1489
01:47:30.362 --> 01:47:31.655
What?

1490
01:47:33.949 --> 01:47:36.451
I was with him
when he talked to Father Bobby.

1491
01:47:39.245 --> 01:47:41.164
I heard everything, Michael.

1492
01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:52.842
So you know.

1493
01:47:55.095 --> 01:47:56.638
Yeah.

1494
01:48:00.266 --> 01:48:02.352
If only you told me.

1495
01:48:06.731 --> 01:48:09.442
I think things could've been different…

1496
01:48:11.236 --> 01:48:13.530
… if you could've talked.

1497
01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:21.162
Maybe— Maybe we—

1498
01:48:23.957 --> 01:48:25.542
Maybe—

1499
01:48:31.423 --> 01:48:32.882
And I—

1500
01:48:49.107 --> 01:48:50.150
Hey, Sid, how you doing?

1501
01:48:50.316 --> 01:48:52.861
Carmen, that diet is working.
I don't care what anybody says.

1502
01:48:55.572 --> 01:48:57.574
You still have a thing for Doris Day.

1503
01:48:57.741 --> 01:48:59.993
She's a good woman.

1504
01:49:00.952 --> 01:49:03.121
You know the <i>strega?</i>

1505
01:49:03.288 --> 01:49:06.458
Hard to miss a lady with four warts
and only one eye.

1506
01:49:06.624 --> 01:49:09.335
She needs the heads.

1507
01:49:09.502 --> 01:49:10.545
Salvatore.

1508
01:49:10.712 --> 01:49:14.174
<i>And when forever is through</i>

1509
01:49:14.507 --> 01:49:16.801
Take this to the witch.

1510
01:49:17.552 --> 01:49:19.304
Now, why does she need the heads?

1511
01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:22.223
- She takes the eyes.
- Oh. Wonderful.

1512
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:26.227
Puts them in a bowl
and mixes them with water and oil.

1513
01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:27.896
And then?

1514
01:49:29.314 --> 01:49:31.983
People get headaches, they go to her.

1515
01:49:32.150 --> 01:49:37.280
She looks into their eyes and tells them
who is wishing the headaches.

1516
01:49:37.447 --> 01:49:41.993
She says a few words
and the headaches go away.

1517
01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.414
Once in a while, the person who wished
the headaches goes away too.

1518
01:49:46.915 --> 01:49:50.835
This guy, Addison,
the one who works for the mayor…

1519
01:49:51.002 --> 01:49:53.671
… he quits his job in two weeks.

1520
01:49:53.838 --> 01:49:57.258
He don't want nobody to know
what kind of a guy he is.

1521
01:49:57.425 --> 01:50:01.679
He don't want nobody to see
pictures of him they shouldn't see.

1522
01:50:02.347 --> 01:50:04.808
- He knows this?
- He will.

1523
01:50:05.517 --> 01:50:07.852
The boys he buys for parties
are expensive.

1524
01:50:08.019 --> 01:50:12.607
Now, Addison makes good money,
but he don't make real money.

1525
01:50:13.024 --> 01:50:14.192
How much does he owe?

1526
01:50:14.359 --> 01:50:18.571
Eight grand with a heavy vig.
I paid that off.

1527
01:50:18.738 --> 01:50:20.240
You paid?

1528
01:50:20.698 --> 01:50:23.618
Addison's debts belong to me now.

1529
01:50:24.452 --> 01:50:27.497
- You hate debts.
- I hate Addison.

1530
01:50:29.541 --> 01:50:33.044
We're in the dirty end of the field now.
That's where I play.

1531
01:50:33.211 --> 01:50:35.296
And I like to play alone.

1532
01:50:35.463 --> 01:50:41.052
You're a nice kid. You always were.
Don't let this change it.

1533
01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:56.568
<i>His mother named him
Edward Goldenberg Robinson…</i>

1534
01:50:56.734 --> 01:50:58.611
<i>… after her favorite actor.</i>

1535
01:50:58.778 --> 01:51:00.613
<i>To continue the Hollywood connection…</i>

1536
01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:03.324
<i>… Eddie Robinson took the street name
Little Caesar…</i>

1537
01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:06.744
<i>… as he made his way up the ranks
of the lucrative drug trade.</i>

1538
01:51:06.911 --> 01:51:10.665
<i>He had a 12-year-old son
in a private school in upstate New York.</i>

1539
01:51:10.832 --> 01:51:13.251
<i>He named him Rizzo,
after his youngest brother…</i>

1540
01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:16.880
<i>… who died while in the custody
of the Wilkinson Home for Boys.</i>

1541
01:51:17.046 --> 01:51:19.549
I want you to give me some money.

1542
01:51:19.716 --> 01:51:24.637
All right. I'll play along.
How long before you pay it back?

1543
01:51:24.804 --> 01:51:28.516
I ain't paying it back. Somebody else is.

1544
01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:34.272
- This somebody I know?
- Your little brother knew him.

1545
01:51:35.148 --> 01:51:36.316
Rizzo?

1546
01:51:36.482 --> 01:51:37.817
Mm-hm.

1547
01:51:38.526 --> 01:51:40.111
How did he know Rizzo?

1548
01:51:40.278 --> 01:51:44.991
Henry Addison was a guard
in a upstate reform school.

1549
01:51:45.158 --> 01:51:49.370
He was there the same time as Rizzo,
before and after he died.

1550
01:51:52.332 --> 01:51:53.958
Bip.

1551
01:51:55.168 --> 01:51:58.671
Count out $8000, put it in an envelope.

1552
01:52:03.843 --> 01:52:06.095
You, uh, go back a long time, old man.

1553
01:52:07.305 --> 01:52:08.932
Old men always do.

1554
01:52:09.307 --> 01:52:11.976
Ran with the guineas
back when the guineas were tough.

1555
01:52:12.143 --> 01:52:14.395
I ran when I could.

1556
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:16.356
Looked good doing it too.

1557
01:52:19.192 --> 01:52:23.988
Gave the business some style,
some class.

1558
01:52:24.197 --> 01:52:28.576
Made it a call for respect
the way you wore it, the way you talked it.

1559
01:52:29.327 --> 01:52:31.829
I always liked that about you.

1560
01:52:31.996 --> 01:52:35.416
I'm no help to you. My tailor is dead.

1561
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:46.678
I'll look up our friend
and collect the money he owes me.

1562
01:52:46.844 --> 01:52:49.013
He owes you something
more than money.

1563
01:52:49.514 --> 01:52:51.516
Ain't nothing worth more than the green.

1564
01:52:52.058 --> 01:52:55.353
- This is.
- What, old man?

1565
01:52:55.561 --> 01:52:58.064
What's this guy owe
that means more than dollars?

1566
01:52:58.231 --> 01:53:02.485
He owes you Rizzo.
He's the man that killed your brother.

1567
01:53:11.828 --> 01:53:14.205
They said he died of pneumonia.

1568
01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:16.332
They said.

1569
01:53:22.755 --> 01:53:24.590
What is the relevance of this?

1570
01:53:24.757 --> 01:53:27.635
So Ralph Ferguson
is a Sunday school teacher.

1571
01:53:27.802 --> 01:53:31.222
I don't know, counsel.
What you're asking is highly unusual.

1572
01:53:31.389 --> 01:53:36.436
I understand that, Your Honor.
Again, I need to put a face to the victim.

1573
01:53:36.602 --> 01:53:39.647
Otherwise it's just another name
in the obituaries.

1574
01:53:40.732 --> 01:53:42.483
Mr. Snyder, any objections?

1575
01:53:44.402 --> 01:53:46.446
I don't have a problem with it.

1576
01:53:46.988 --> 01:53:51.326
Your Honor, the prosecution would like
to call Ralph Ferguson to the stand.

1577
01:54:17.226 --> 01:54:19.479
- Good morning, Mr. Ferguson.
- Good morning.

1578
01:54:19.645 --> 01:54:22.690
Thank you for coming,
I realize for you it's been a long trip.

1579
01:54:23.608 --> 01:54:26.152
I'm just sorry it had to be
for something like this.

1580
01:54:27.111 --> 01:54:29.030
You and the victim
were such good friends.

1581
01:54:29.197 --> 01:54:32.325
I think your testimony as a character
witness will be very valuable.

1582
01:54:32.492 --> 01:54:35.536
We were great friends.
It would be hard to find a better friend.

1583
01:54:36.162 --> 01:54:40.500
- Would you say you were his best friend?
- I was his closest, that's for sure.

1584
01:54:40.666 --> 01:54:45.213
- How long did you know each other?
- Uh, about 17, 18 years.

1585
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.382
And did you see each other often?

1586
01:54:47.548 --> 01:54:53.471
As often as we could. Weekends,
holidays, vacations, things like that.

1587
01:54:53.846 --> 01:54:57.266
- What kind of man was Sean Nokes?
- He was a good man.

1588
01:54:57.433 --> 01:55:00.186
He was too good to be shot dead
by a couple of street punks.

1589
01:55:00.353 --> 01:55:02.897
Objection, Your Honor.
Statement is opinion, not fact.

1590
01:55:03.064 --> 01:55:07.693
- He was asked his opinion.
- Overruled. Please, proceed.

1591
01:55:08.444 --> 01:55:12.657
Mr. Ferguson, were you aware of
any enemies he might have had?

1592
01:55:13.116 --> 01:55:14.951
Sean Nokes had no enemies.

1593
01:55:15.576 --> 01:55:19.163
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson.
I have no further questions.

1594
01:55:23.668 --> 01:55:25.086
What is that, a prison?

1595
01:55:25.253 --> 01:55:27.547
No, it's a juvenile facility for young boys.

1596
01:55:27.713 --> 01:55:30.591
And your function was what
at this juvenile facility?

1597
01:55:30.758 --> 01:55:32.552
Standard stuff.

1598
01:55:32.718 --> 01:55:37.348
Keep the boys in line,
make sure they got to their classes on time.

1599
01:55:37.515 --> 01:55:40.977
Keep an eye out for trouble, put them down
for the night. Nothing exciting.

1600
01:55:41.144 --> 01:55:44.605
As guards, were you and Mr. Nokes
allowed to use force…

1601
01:55:44.772 --> 01:55:47.108
… to as you put it,
"keep the boys in line"?

1602
01:55:47.942 --> 01:55:50.903
- What? What do you mean, force?
- Were you allowed to hit them?

1603
01:55:51.946 --> 01:55:53.823
No, of course not.

1604
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:58.870
Were any of the boys hit by any of the
guards at any time at the Wilkinson home?

1605
01:55:59.537 --> 01:56:03.875
I'm sure that something like that
may have happened. It was a big place.

1606
01:56:04.041 --> 01:56:05.751
But it wasn't the common practice.

1607
01:56:05.918 --> 01:56:07.920
Sure. Let's narrow the place down, then.

1608
01:56:08.087 --> 01:56:11.549
Did you or Mr. Nokes ever hit
any of the boys under your care…

1609
01:56:11.966 --> 01:56:14.552
… at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1610
01:56:22.059 --> 01:56:25.980
- Would you like me to repeat the question?
- No.

1611
01:56:27.565 --> 01:56:30.318
Then answer it, please.
And remember, you're under oath.

1612
01:56:30.693 --> 01:56:35.698
A few of the boys who we considered to be
discipline problems were hit on occasion.

1613
01:56:35.865 --> 01:56:39.035
- And, uh, how were they hit?
- I don't know what you mean.

1614
01:56:39.202 --> 01:56:44.123
A fist, open hand, kick, baton maybe?

1615
01:56:44.874 --> 01:56:48.503
- Depended on what the situation called for.
- Who determined that situation?

1616
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:50.338
The guard on the scene.

1617
01:56:50.505 --> 01:56:52.924
That's a lot of power to have
over a boy, isn't it?

1618
01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:57.637
- It came with the job, sir.
- Did torture come with the job?

1619
01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:08.606
Boys were tortured, weren't they,
Mr. Ferguson?

1620
01:57:08.773 --> 01:57:10.608
Define torture.

1621
01:57:11.776 --> 01:57:14.278
Well, let's define torture.

1622
01:57:14.946 --> 01:57:17.907
Uh, cigarette burning…

1623
01:57:18.282 --> 01:57:20.409
… random beatings…

1624
01:57:20.952 --> 01:57:25.289
… solitary confinement
with no food and no light.

1625
01:57:26.290 --> 01:57:27.375
Say that took place?

1626
01:57:28.751 --> 01:57:30.962
- On occasion.
- Who tortured them?

1627
01:57:32.129 --> 01:57:34.590
- Guards.
- Which guards?

1628
01:57:35.841 --> 01:57:38.302
I don't— I can't remember all of them.

1629
01:57:40.137 --> 01:57:42.098
Remember one.

1630
01:57:42.974 --> 01:57:45.184
Mr. Ferguson, remember one.

1631
01:57:50.565 --> 01:57:51.899
Remember one?

1632
01:57:56.445 --> 01:57:58.114
Let me ask you this, Mr. Ferguson—

1633
01:57:58.281 --> 01:58:02.076
This line of questioning better lead
somewhere having to do with this case.

1634
01:58:02.243 --> 01:58:04.870
- It will, Your Honor.
- For your sake.

1635
01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:06.080
Yes, sir.

1636
01:58:06.247 --> 01:58:11.002
Mr. Ferguson, was there ever any sexual
abuse at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1637
01:58:13.671 --> 01:58:19.010
Was there ever any sexual abuse
at the Wilkinson Home for Boys?

1638
01:58:20.011 --> 01:58:23.222
- Yes, I heard that there was.
- I'm not asking what you heard.

1639
01:58:23.389 --> 01:58:27.476
I'm asking what you saw.

1640
01:58:28.561 --> 01:58:31.731
- Please, don't do this.
- Don't do what? I thought you boys liked it.

1641
01:58:33.107 --> 01:58:34.984
Yes, I saw.

1642
01:58:35.901 --> 01:58:41.073
And did you and Sean Nokes
ever force yourself on any of the boys?

1643
01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:46.704
Did you and Sean Nokes ever rape
any of the boys at Wilkinson Home?

1644
01:58:52.793 --> 01:58:54.420
Counselors…

1645
01:58:55.838 --> 01:58:57.381
… approach.

1646
01:59:08.434 --> 01:59:10.311
I just fucked your little friend Johnny.

1647
01:59:10.519 --> 01:59:13.397
Counselor,
what the hell is going on here?

1648
01:59:15.316 --> 01:59:17.068
Guess I called the wrong witness.

1649
01:59:17.234 --> 01:59:20.946
Counselor, I've given you wide latitude
in calling this character witness.

1650
01:59:21.113 --> 01:59:22.615
Now it's blown up in your face.

1651
01:59:23.074 --> 01:59:25.868
<i>Please, Ferguson, don't do this, please.</i>

1652
01:59:30.039 --> 01:59:32.583
Mr. Ferguson,
please, answer the question.

1653
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:34.251
<i>Please, Ferguson.</i>

1654
01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:38.923
Let me ask, Mr. Ferguson.
Sean Nokes…

1655
01:59:39.090 --> 01:59:40.091
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

1656
01:59:40.257 --> 01:59:43.678
… visited your home
on numerous occasions. Is that correct?

1657
01:59:43.844 --> 01:59:47.723
Did your ex-wife ever leave Sean Nokes
alone with your child?

1658
01:59:47.890 --> 01:59:49.183
A child?

1659
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:54.355
Yes. In other words, would your ex-wife ever
leave Sean Nokes alone with your child?

1660
01:59:54.522 --> 01:59:55.940
There'd be no reason for that.

1661
01:59:56.107 --> 02:00:00.027
There would be no reason for him to be
alone with our child. It wouldn't come up.

1662
02:00:00.194 --> 02:00:03.614
Aha. Never came up?
Did she ever voice any concern?

1663
02:00:03.781 --> 02:00:08.869
We have a statement, uh, explaining
why she would never allow Sean Nokes…

1664
02:00:09.036 --> 02:00:12.748
… to be in a room alone with your son.

1665
02:00:12.915 --> 02:00:14.166
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1666
02:00:20.423 --> 02:00:22.508
<i>I like it nice and slow.</i>

1667
02:00:23.384 --> 02:00:25.678
<i>You ain't gonna touch me ever again!</i>

1668
02:00:35.479 --> 02:00:36.689
Yes.

1669
02:00:47.491 --> 02:00:48.909
Yes?

1670
02:00:53.539 --> 02:00:55.332
Yes, what?

1671
02:01:00.129 --> 02:01:04.133
Yes, Sean Nokes
had experiences with some boys.

1672
02:01:06.969 --> 02:01:08.471
Were you there?

1673
02:01:09.847 --> 02:01:11.223
Yes.

1674
02:01:11.766 --> 02:01:16.270
- Did you observe these experiences?
- Yes.

1675
02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.441
Did you more than observe?

1676
02:01:20.608 --> 02:01:23.527
I was drinking then.

1677
02:01:25.529 --> 02:01:29.492
Were there any other guards around
during these experiences?

1678
02:01:30.159 --> 02:01:31.869
Yes.

1679
02:01:33.329 --> 02:01:35.915
- With you and Mr. Nokes?
- Yes.

1680
02:01:36.707 --> 02:01:38.667
On more than one occasion?

1681
02:01:39.293 --> 02:01:40.878
Yes.

1682
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:45.549
Yeah.

1683
02:01:52.139 --> 02:01:57.061
Mr. Ferguson, do you still think that
Sean Nokes was a good man?

1684
02:01:57.645 --> 02:01:58.813
He was my friend.

1685
02:02:02.066 --> 02:02:06.028
A friend who raped and abused boys
he was paid to look after?

1686
02:02:17.665 --> 02:02:20.084
I have no further questions.

1687
02:02:24.922 --> 02:02:27.216
I want this to be over.

1688
02:02:28.717 --> 02:02:31.262
I want this to be over.

1689
02:02:33.848 --> 02:02:36.225
Witness is excused.

1690
02:02:36.725 --> 02:02:38.644
Mr. Ferguson.

1691
02:02:40.104 --> 02:02:42.106
Mr. Ferguson.

1692
02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:46.443
If I were you,
I wouldn't stray too far from home.

1693
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:49.780
People will want to talk to you.
Do you understand?

1694
02:02:51.699 --> 02:02:54.952
<i>Michael continued to swim
both ends of the pool at the same time.</i>

1695
02:02:55.119 --> 02:02:58.914
<i>Playing prosecution and defense attorney,
he exposed Ferguson for what he was…</i>

1696
02:02:59.081 --> 02:03:01.959
<i>… and still kept John and Tommy's
motive for killing Nokes…</i>

1697
02:03:02.126 --> 02:03:03.711
<i>… hidden from the eyes of the court.</i>

1698
02:03:04.003 --> 02:03:08.632
<i>Little Caesar, who always kept a picture
of his dead brother in his breast pocket…</i>

1699
02:03:08.799 --> 02:03:10.509
<i>… called in the Henry Addison loan.</i>

1700
02:03:12.386 --> 02:03:15.306
<i>It was a loan Addison
couldn't afford to pay back.</i>

1701
02:03:15.472 --> 02:03:20.436
<i>And it gave Little Caesar the only reason
he needed to even his score for Rizzo.</i>

1702
02:03:50.507 --> 02:03:54.178
<i>Davenport wasted little time on
following up on Adam Styler.</i>

1703
02:03:54.345 --> 02:03:58.557
<i>He was quickly arrested and charged with the
shooting death of the Queens drug dealer…</i>

1704
02:03:58.724 --> 02:04:00.893
<i>… and eight counts
of corruption and bribery.</i>

1705
02:04:14.865 --> 02:04:16.367
That's six for me, two for you.

1706
02:04:19.745 --> 02:04:23.415
See, most people play this game
in the summer.

1707
02:04:23.582 --> 02:04:26.043
Easier to see the ball
without tears in your eyes.

1708
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.545
- Yeah?
- I give a fuck about most people.

1709
02:04:33.550 --> 02:04:37.554
You're gonna have a heart attack
and I'm not breathing in your mouth.

1710
02:04:37.721 --> 02:04:40.557
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to marry you either.

1711
02:04:43.227 --> 02:04:46.981
John and Tommy smell something.
They just don't know what.

1712
02:04:47.147 --> 02:04:50.985
Ha, ha. A spic be living in the White House
by the time it reaches their fucking brains.

1713
02:04:51.151 --> 02:04:52.736
Snyder came through big.

1714
02:04:52.903 --> 02:04:56.448
He's not half bad. The way you told it,
I thought he could hardly stand up.

1715
02:04:56.615 --> 02:04:59.243
Oh, he's a drunk, but he's not a fool.

1716
02:04:59.785 --> 02:05:02.371
We only win when John
and Tommy walk.

1717
02:05:02.538 --> 02:05:04.915
Then you have to get them
out of the shooting hall.

1718
02:05:05.082 --> 02:05:08.752
You have to put them someplace else.
And only a witness does that for you.

1719
02:05:08.919 --> 02:05:12.214
Now, he's doing a Claude Rains so far.
Nobody's seen the fucker.

1720
02:05:12.381 --> 02:05:16.552
What if he doesn't show?
What if we have to go on the way we are?

1721
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:18.887
The street is the only one that matters.

1722
02:05:19.304 --> 02:05:24.059
Court is for uptown people with suits,
money, lawyers with three names.

1723
02:05:24.226 --> 02:05:26.812
If you got cash,
you can buy court justice.

1724
02:05:26.979 --> 02:05:29.690
But on the street, justice has no price.

1725
02:05:29.857 --> 02:05:33.444
She's blind where the judge sits,
but she's not blind out here.

1726
02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:36.071
Out here, the bitch got eyes.

1727
02:05:37.239 --> 02:05:38.991
We need both.

1728
02:05:40.451 --> 02:05:42.619
Then you need a witness.

1729
02:06:28.916 --> 02:06:30.751
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury…</i>

1730
02:06:30.918 --> 02:06:33.796
<i>… you are to disregard the testimony
of Ralph Ferguson.</i>

1731
02:06:34.421 --> 02:06:37.758
His entire testimony
is stricken from this record.

1732
02:06:38.175 --> 02:06:39.968
That concludes the people's case.

1733
02:06:40.135 --> 02:06:41.845
- People rest?
- People rest.

1734
02:06:42.471 --> 02:06:44.264
<i>Is the defense ready to proceed?</i>

1735
02:06:44.431 --> 02:06:45.849
Uh…

1736
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:51.396
<i>I'm not sure, uh, Your Honor.
I don't, uh— I don't know, uh—</i>

1737
02:06:51.563 --> 02:06:54.900
- You don't know?
- Well, I'm not sure that, uh— We're waiting—

1738
02:06:55.067 --> 02:06:57.111
All right, 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

1739
02:06:57.277 --> 02:07:00.197
<i>Present a witness or be prepared to sum up.
Nine a.m.</i>

1740
02:07:22.302 --> 02:07:23.887
- Everything good?
- Good.

1741
02:07:24.054 --> 02:07:26.807
Good, glad to hear that. Bye-bye.

1742
02:07:58.422 --> 02:08:02.926
- You're late.
- Very interesting attending morning Mass.

1743
02:08:05.846 --> 02:08:08.348
Your Honor, the defense calls
Father Robert Carrillo.

1744
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:18.984
<i>You know most people in your parish?</i>

1745
02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:20.694
<i>I know all the people.</i>

1746
02:08:20.861 --> 02:08:23.780
<i>You know the two defendants,
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano?</i>

1747
02:08:23.947 --> 02:08:26.450
<i>- Yes, I do.
- How long have you known them?</i>

1748
02:08:26.617 --> 02:08:29.620
<i>Since they were boys.
They were both students of mine.</i>

1749
02:08:29.786 --> 02:08:31.705
Remain standing.

1750
02:08:31.872 --> 02:08:34.958
- Place your left hand on the Bible.
<i>- It'll be 20 years this spring.</i>

1751
02:08:35.125 --> 02:08:37.211
- Raise your right hand.
<i>- I'm a priest.</i>

1752
02:08:37.377 --> 02:08:39.922
In the case of the people of
the State of New York…

1753
02:08:40.088 --> 02:08:42.090
… against John Reilly
and Thomas Marcano…

1754
02:08:42.257 --> 02:08:46.053
… do you swear the evidence you're about
to give is the truth, the whole truth…

1755
02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:48.430
… and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1756
02:08:48.972 --> 02:08:50.474
I do.

1757
02:08:55.354 --> 02:08:56.647
Ahem, Father…

1758
02:08:56.813 --> 02:09:00.859
… do you recall, uh, where you were on
the night of November 1st, this past year?

1759
02:09:01.026 --> 02:09:03.570
- Yes, I do.
- Where was that?

1760
02:09:03.737 --> 02:09:07.991
I was at the basketball game at
the Garden, the Knicks versus the Celtics.

1761
02:09:08.158 --> 02:09:11.495
And when did the Knick game begin?

1762
02:09:13.497 --> 02:09:15.916
- About 7:30.
- What time did it end?

1763
02:09:16.333 --> 02:09:17.793
Between 9:30 and 10.

1764
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:20.128
You remember who won that game?

1765
02:09:20.963 --> 02:09:22.673
Sad to say it was the Celtics.

1766
02:09:22.839 --> 02:09:26.134
Kevin McHale and Robert Parish
were too much for our boys that night…

1767
02:09:26.301 --> 02:09:28.220
… even if it was All Saints' Day.

1768
02:09:28.887 --> 02:09:31.223
Next time, you give me a call,
I'll try my guy.

1769
02:09:31.598 --> 02:09:33.016
I'll try that.

1770
02:09:35.352 --> 02:09:37.479
Father Carrillo,
were you at the game alone?

1771
02:09:38.897 --> 02:09:40.899
No, I went there with two friends.

1772
02:09:41.066 --> 02:09:43.860
And who were those two friends, Father?

1773
02:09:44.611 --> 02:09:47.030
John Reilly and Thomas Marcano.

1774
02:09:48.282 --> 02:09:49.741
The two defendants?

1775
02:09:50.158 --> 02:09:52.577
Yes, the same two defendants.

1776
02:09:53.203 --> 02:09:55.205
Father Carrillo, at 8:25 p.m.…

1777
02:09:55.372 --> 02:09:59.501
… the time that police say victim
Sean Nokes was murdered…

1778
02:09:59.668 --> 02:10:03.588
… were you still with Mr. Reilly
and Mr. Marcano at the basketball game?

1779
02:10:03.755 --> 02:10:05.257
Yes, I was.

1780
02:10:05.424 --> 02:10:09.344
And at what time did you, Mr. Reilly
and Mr. Marcano part company?

1781
02:10:10.804 --> 02:10:14.474
It was around 10:30, a little later.

1782
02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:18.395
They dropped me off in front of the rectory,
near where they had picked me up.

1783
02:10:18.562 --> 02:10:21.315
Did the two defendants tell you
where they were going?

1784
02:10:21.481 --> 02:10:23.984
No, but I imagine
after a night spent with a priest…

1785
02:10:24.151 --> 02:10:27.195
… they went looking for the first open bar
they could find.

1786
02:10:27.612 --> 02:10:32.909
So then, Father, if the two defendants were
with you at 8:25 at the night of the murder…

1787
02:10:33.076 --> 02:10:36.830
… they couldn't have shot and killed
Sean Nokes, as the prosecution contends.

1788
02:10:36.997 --> 02:10:38.081
Isn't that correct?

1789
02:10:39.374 --> 02:10:42.085
Not unless they shot him
from the blue seats at the Garden.

1790
02:10:42.252 --> 02:10:43.795
No.

1791
02:10:44.755 --> 02:10:47.090
He was not shot from there.

1792
02:10:49.468 --> 02:10:52.095
Then he was not shot by those boys.

1793
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:56.183
No further questions, Your Honor.
Thank you, Father.

1794
02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:57.976
Your witness, Mr. Sullivan.

1795
02:10:58.143 --> 02:11:00.020
Thank you, Your Honor.

1796
02:11:04.649 --> 02:11:06.693
You buy the tickets?
Were they given to you?

1797
02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:08.570
- I bought them.
- The day of the game?

1798
02:11:08.737 --> 02:11:11.323
I went to the box office
about a week before.

1799
02:11:11.823 --> 02:11:13.909
Uh, did anyone know you were going
to the game…

1800
02:11:14.076 --> 02:11:16.328
- … other than the defendants?
- I don't think so.

1801
02:11:16.495 --> 02:11:18.872
Was anyone with you
when you purchased the tickets?

1802
02:11:19.039 --> 02:11:21.625
- No.
- No one saw you buy the tickets?

1803
02:11:21.792 --> 02:11:23.835
- That's right.
- Did you get a receipt?

1804
02:11:24.002 --> 02:11:28.131
- No, I didn't.
- Pay by check? MasterCard? Visa?

1805
02:11:28.298 --> 02:11:32.010
No, I paid by cash.
I usually pay for things in cash.

1806
02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:36.306
You care for the boys in your parish,
don't you, Father?

1807
02:11:36.473 --> 02:11:38.016
Very much.

1808
02:11:38.475 --> 02:11:41.478
And there isn't anything you wouldn't do
for them, am I right?

1809
02:11:41.645 --> 02:11:44.398
Anything in my power to do,
I would make it a point.

1810
02:11:45.190 --> 02:11:48.610
Like a father, a good father,
looking out for one of his sons.

1811
02:11:49.444 --> 02:11:52.572
- Something along those lines, yes.
- Is it true, as a good father…

1812
02:11:52.739 --> 02:11:55.992
… you'd want to protect them
from something they shouldn't have done?

1813
02:11:56.159 --> 02:11:58.078
As much as I would want
to protect them…

1814
02:11:58.245 --> 02:12:00.497
… from something
someone else said they did, yes.

1815
02:12:01.081 --> 02:12:02.124
Like a murder?

1816
02:12:02.833 --> 02:12:04.167
Yes, like a murder.

1817
02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:07.462
Let me get this straight, then.

1818
02:12:07.629 --> 02:12:09.965
No one knew you went to the game
or saw you there.

1819
02:12:10.132 --> 02:12:13.343
No one saw you buy tickets.
There's no record you even bought tickets.

1820
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:16.930
You have no receipt for the tickets.
Am I correct?

1821
02:12:18.557 --> 02:12:19.766
Yes, that's correct.

1822
02:12:19.933 --> 02:12:22.018
Then how do we really know, Father?

1823
02:12:22.185 --> 02:12:26.398
How do we know you and the two defendants
were at the game on the night of the murder?

1824
02:12:27.774 --> 02:12:31.445
I'm telling you as a witness
and as a priest, we were at the game.

1825
02:12:31.611 --> 02:12:35.532
Yes, as a priest, and a priest wouldn't lie.
Am I right?

1826
02:12:36.032 --> 02:12:39.035
A priest with ticket stubs
wouldn't need to lie.

1827
02:12:39.202 --> 02:12:43.832
And I always keep the stubs.

1828
02:12:47.836 --> 02:12:49.004
Do you want to see?

1829
02:12:56.052 --> 02:12:58.221
Why is that, Father?
Uh, why do you keep the stubs?

1830
02:12:59.139 --> 02:13:02.893
Because you never know when someone
might want more than your word.

1831
02:13:04.144 --> 02:13:06.229
Has anyone questioned your word
before today?

1832
02:13:06.396 --> 02:13:08.815
No, no one ever has.

1833
02:13:09.232 --> 02:13:11.735
But there's a first time for everything.

1834
02:13:20.911 --> 02:13:24.039
I have no further questions.
Thank you, Father.

1835
02:13:25.916 --> 02:13:28.210
Thank you, Father. You may step down.

1836
02:13:35.592 --> 02:13:39.262
<i>I've never recovered from seeing
Father Bobby take the stand and lie for us…</i>

1837
02:13:39.429 --> 02:13:42.474
<i>… to even the score for John and Tommy.</i>

1838
02:13:42.641 --> 02:13:46.144
<i>He didn't just testify for them,
he testified against Wilkinson…</i>

1839
02:13:46.311 --> 02:13:48.939
<i>… and the evil that had lived there
for too long.</i>

1840
02:13:49.105 --> 02:13:51.650
<i>Still, I was sorry he had to do it.</i>

1841
02:13:58.490 --> 02:14:01.284
With respect to the charge of murder
in the second degree…

1842
02:14:01.451 --> 02:14:05.330
… do you find the defendant, John Reilly,
guilty or not guilty?

1843
02:14:05.497 --> 02:14:07.457
- Not guilty.
- With respect to the charge…

1844
02:14:07.624 --> 02:14:09.167
… murder in the second degree…

1845
02:14:09.334 --> 02:14:14.130
… do you find the defendant,
Thomas Marcano, guilty or not guilty?

1846
02:14:14.297 --> 02:14:15.674
Not guilty.

1847
02:14:16.299 --> 02:14:20.512
<i>Thank you very much.
This jury is discharged.</i>

1848
02:14:40.323 --> 02:14:43.910
- Hi, how are you? Could I get a hot dog?
- Yeah, sure.

1849
02:14:44.077 --> 02:14:46.621
- Uh, mustard, relish.
- No problem.

1850
02:14:46.788 --> 02:14:48.540
A lot of relish.

1851
02:14:51.001 --> 02:14:53.503
- Give him two napkins.
- Yeah.

1852
02:14:58.091 --> 02:15:00.343
You did good in there, counselor.

1853
02:15:02.012 --> 02:15:03.847
So, what happens to you now?

1854
02:15:04.014 --> 02:15:06.349
What happens? I walk away.

1855
02:15:07.517 --> 02:15:10.353
I'll wait a few weeks,
I'll hand in my notice.

1856
02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:13.064
And after the way I handled this case…

1857
02:15:13.231 --> 02:15:16.192
… they won't be in a rush
to keep me from the door.

1858
02:15:18.111 --> 02:15:20.905
So you switch to the other side,
work as a defense lawyer.

1859
02:15:21.072 --> 02:15:22.782
The money's better.

1860
02:15:22.949 --> 02:15:26.661
There's always gonna be more bad guys
than good, Mikey.

1861
02:15:27.704 --> 02:15:31.291
And can you imagine the work you'd get
from John and Tommy's crew?

1862
02:15:31.458 --> 02:15:33.251
That's a house and a pool.

1863
02:15:35.253 --> 02:15:36.963
Not for me.

1864
02:15:37.672 --> 02:15:40.216
I've seen all the law I want to see.

1865
02:15:40.884 --> 02:15:43.928
- It's time for something else.
- Like what?

1866
02:15:44.095 --> 02:15:45.388
Let you know when I know.

1867
02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.808
You're too old
to play for the Yankees…

1868
02:15:48.975 --> 02:15:50.602
… and you're too young to take up golf.

1869
02:15:50.769 --> 02:15:55.148
Why are you shooting holes through
all my plans? You're gonna make me panic.

1870
02:15:55.732 --> 02:15:58.193
You'll work it out. You always have.

1871
02:16:03.365 --> 02:16:05.784
It's time for quiet, Shakes.

1872
02:16:07.369 --> 02:16:11.247
I just want to shut my eyes
and not have to see the places I've been.

1873
02:16:13.333 --> 02:16:15.126
I'm weary.

1874
02:16:18.546 --> 02:16:20.340
I don't know.

1875
02:16:22.926 --> 02:16:25.679
Maybe I'll get lucky,
forget I was even there.

1876
02:16:26.638 --> 02:16:28.890
Well, don't disappear on me, counselor.

1877
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:32.060
I may need a good lawyer one day.

1878
02:16:32.227 --> 02:16:35.563
- Hey, you can't afford a good lawyer.
- Oh, yeah.

1879
02:16:36.564 --> 02:16:38.858
May need a good friend though.

1880
02:16:41.277 --> 02:16:44.030
I'll find you when you do. Count on it.

1881
02:16:45.865 --> 02:16:47.784
I always have.

1882
02:16:53.665 --> 02:16:57.460
<i>A full month had passed since the acquittal
and no one had made contact.</i>

1883
02:16:57.627 --> 02:16:59.713
<i>In those few weeks,
our lives reverted back…</i>

1884
02:16:59.879 --> 02:17:03.049
<i>… to what they had been
prior to the murder of Sean Nokes.</i>

1885
02:17:03.216 --> 02:17:05.885
<i>Carol had returned to her stack
of Social Service files…</i>

1886
02:17:06.052 --> 02:17:08.680
<i>… helping troubled teens
and single mothers.</i>

1887
02:17:08.847 --> 02:17:13.101
<i>John and Tommy went back to the streets,
running the West Side Boys.</i>

1888
02:17:13.268 --> 02:17:18.022
<i>I was promoted from clerk to reporter
trainee, covering the entertainment beat.</i>

1889
02:17:18.189 --> 02:17:20.525
<i>Michael, as he'd promised,
resigned from his job…</i>

1890
02:17:20.692 --> 02:17:23.361
<i>… after working the losing end
of a can't-miss case.</i>

1891
02:17:24.154 --> 02:17:25.822
Excuse me.

1892
02:17:27.991 --> 02:17:29.784
I don't know how to fucking thank you.

1893
02:17:32.829 --> 02:17:34.122
All right.

1894
02:17:34.289 --> 02:17:36.875
I can't believe what you did.
And you got away with it.

1895
02:17:37.041 --> 02:17:39.753
It wasn't me, man. That was Mikey.
It was all Mikey's plan.

1896
02:17:39.919 --> 02:17:42.630
When I heard he took the case,
I was gonna have him burned.

1897
02:17:42.797 --> 02:17:45.049
- And?
- He's a friend. If you gotta be sent away…

1898
02:17:45.216 --> 02:17:47.093
… on a murder rap, who better to do it?

1899
02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:50.138
The way he handled his case
I thought he sucked as a lawyer…

1900
02:17:50.305 --> 02:17:54.476
- … and started feeling sorry for the bastard.
- Hey, never feel sorry for a lawyer.

1901
02:17:55.435 --> 02:17:57.812
Get over here, counselor.

1902
02:17:57.979 --> 02:18:03.443
You are the real count,
alive and well and living in New York.

1903
02:18:05.028 --> 02:18:07.113
You maniac. All right, all right.

1904
02:18:07.864 --> 02:18:11.117
- You maniac. Jesus, enough.
- What, is this a gay bar?

1905
02:18:12.535 --> 02:18:14.287
It was until you came in.

1906
02:18:14.454 --> 02:18:16.790
Why don't you give me a kiss
to go with that hello?

1907
02:18:22.504 --> 02:18:24.214
Get out of the way.

1908
02:18:30.011 --> 02:18:31.846
Let's have a drink.

1909
02:18:36.643 --> 02:18:37.936
The Four Gladiators.

1910
02:18:38.102 --> 02:18:40.730
- I was trying to forget, you know?
- The Four Gladiators.

1911
02:18:40.897 --> 02:18:43.566
Worst quartet to ever hold
a Hell's Kitchen corner.

1912
02:18:43.733 --> 02:18:46.194
But what was that name
that Shakes wanted to call it?

1913
02:18:46.361 --> 02:18:49.572
No, no, genius wanted to call it
"The Count and His Cristos."

1914
02:18:49.739 --> 02:18:53.284
- Nice.
- I know, it's so sweet, isn't it?

1915
02:18:54.869 --> 02:18:58.039
We weren't that bad. I mean,
some people wanted to hear us sing.

1916
02:18:58.206 --> 02:19:00.667
Yeah, the kids at the deaf school
don't count.

1917
02:19:05.296 --> 02:19:06.422
One song for Carol.

1918
02:19:06.756 --> 02:19:08.508
- Oh, no.
- I retired a long time ago.

1919
02:19:08.675 --> 02:19:09.884
- Come on, you mutts.
- Wait.

1920
02:19:10.051 --> 02:19:12.303
Don't you guys have to go out
and shoot somebody?

1921
02:19:15.139 --> 02:19:16.599
No.

1922
02:19:17.016 --> 02:19:20.353
No, we always got time for a song.

1923
02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:22.981
Just kidding, you know what I'm saying?

1924
02:19:23.147 --> 02:19:25.441
- Wine, anybody?
- You pick it, Mike. None too slow.

1925
02:19:25.608 --> 02:19:27.694
- Let's do it right. Start us up.
- All right.

1926
02:19:31.072 --> 02:19:34.450
- How many songs did you know?
- One.

1927
02:19:39.372 --> 02:19:45.128
<i>Walk like a man</i>

1928
02:19:46.838 --> 02:19:51.092
<i>Walk like a man
Fast as you can</i>

1929
02:19:51.259 --> 02:19:54.554
<i>Walk like a man, my son</i>

1930
02:19:58.683 --> 02:20:01.394
Don't forget about the girl!

1931
02:20:14.574 --> 02:20:16.826
<i>On March 16th, 1984…</i>

1932
02:20:16.993 --> 02:20:20.496
<i>… John Reilly's bloated body was found
face-up in a tenement building…</i>

1933
02:20:20.663 --> 02:20:23.374
<i>… right next to the bottle of boiler gin
that killed him.</i>

1934
02:20:23.541 --> 02:20:27.670
<i>At the time of his death, he was a suspect
in five unsolved homicides.</i>

1935
02:20:27.837 --> 02:20:31.007
<i>He was two weeks past his 29th birthday.</i>

1936
02:20:35.094 --> 02:20:38.848
<i>Thomas Marcano died on July 26th, 1985.</i>

1937
02:20:39.015 --> 02:20:41.392
<i>He was shot at close range five times.</i>

1938
02:20:41.559 --> 02:20:44.354
<i>The body lay undiscovered
for more than a week.</i>

1939
02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:47.857
<i>There was a crucifix
and a picture of Saint Jude in his pocket.</i>

1940
02:20:48.024 --> 02:20:50.443
<i>He was 29 years old.</i>

1941
02:20:51.819 --> 02:20:54.948
<i>Michael Sullivan lives in a small town
in the English countryside…</i>

1942
02:20:55.114 --> 02:20:57.200
<i>… where he works part-time
as a carpenter.</i>

1943
02:20:57.367 --> 02:21:00.912
<i>He no longer practices law
and he has never married.</i>

1944
02:21:01.079 --> 02:21:03.665
<i>He lives quietly and alone.</i>

1945
02:21:05.708 --> 02:21:10.046
<i>Carol still works for a Social Service agency
and lives in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

1946
02:21:10.213 --> 02:21:11.714
<i>She has never married…</i>

1947
02:21:11.881 --> 02:21:15.343
<i>… but is a single mother
supporting her growing 12-year-old son.</i>

1948
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:20.056
<i>The boy, John Thomas Michael Martinez,
loves to read…</i>

1949
02:21:20.223 --> 02:21:22.892
<i>… and is called Shakes by his mother.</i>

1950
02:21:24.894 --> 02:21:28.731
<i>It was our special night
and we held it for as long as we could.</i>

1951
02:21:28.898 --> 02:21:31.192
<i>It was our happy ending…</i>

1952
02:21:31.359 --> 02:21:33.736
<i>… and the last time we would ever
be together again.</i>

1953
02:22:23.453 --> 02:22:25.580
<i>The future lay sparkling ahead…</i>

1954
02:22:25.747 --> 02:22:28.875
<i>… and we thought we would know
each other forever.</i>
