Marry me.

24
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.672
No.

25
00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:34.882
Marry me.

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:40.988
Change me.

27
00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.829
Okay, I will if you marry me.

28
00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:50.898
It's called a compromise.

29
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.606
That's just called coercion.

30
00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.274
It's not fair.

31
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.911
Marriage is just...

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:05.813
It's a piece of paper.

it's the way one says,
"I love you."

at my age,

it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up."

So, you're worried
about what people
will think?

You know,
two out of three
marriages end in divorce.

Well, I think you'll find
the vampire/human divorce rate

39
00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.582
is a little lower.

40
00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:47.988
So marry me.

41
00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:53.861

00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:40.774
Okay.

48
00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:45.646
You understand
why you're being
punished, right?

49
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.848
I know, I put you through hell.

50
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:49.550
Yes, you did.

51
00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.455
But I have other
reasons for grounding you.

52
00:05:54.488 --> 00:05:55.656
Like...

53
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.796
I just want you to
get some separation
from him.

you can say.

You're not grounded anymore

60
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.825
if you use your
new-found freedom

61
00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:34.094

friends, too, like...

62

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.808

I have until graduation
to see him.

if you're too angry

for me to come to
your room tonight.

They are the
bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

108

And that is why you
are not valedictorian.

109
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.095
Jess doesn't need cliches.

110
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.997

are we gonna graduate

I've never seen your house.

you said last time.

money 'cause it's

You looked worried.

sailed long ago.

We've been tracking
the situation in Seattle
for a while.

137
00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:39.032
If the situation gets
any more conspicuous,
the Volturi will step in.

138
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.270
If they go to Seattle,
they could come here.

139
00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:44.805
They could see I'm still human.

140
00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:46.807
It won't get that far.

141
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.178
But we'll go to Seattle
if we have to.

I'll fax these down,
first thing.

Hey.

You ready for dinner?

146
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.054
Yeah.

147
00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.757
It is still just
you and I, right?

148
00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:07.094
No, I'm just dropping her off.

149
00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.229
See you later.

150
00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.297
Bye.

151
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.403
Bella, my parents
wanted to remind you
about the airline ticket

152
00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:18.138
you got for your birthday.

153
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:19.472
What airline ticket?

154
00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:23.443
A round trip ticket
to see Mom in Florida.

155
00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:26.346
That was generous.

156
00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:28.949
It expires soon,
so you might want to
use it this weekend.

157
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:32.853
Well, I can't just
drop everything and go.

158
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.988
It might be your
last chance to see her
before you graduate.

159
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.558
CHARLIE: Might not
be a bad idea.

160
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.829
Get out of town
for a couple days.
Get some distance.

161
00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:44.097
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
seeing Mom.

162
00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.368
As long as you use
the companion ticket.

163
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.403
Wait.
There's two tickets?

164
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.875
Super.

165
00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:56.776
That makes me really happy.

166
00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.015
BELLA: I did want
to see my mom.

167
00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:05.285
I wanted to know
that her life was
full and satisfying.

168
00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:10.457
RENEE: Aren't you
gonna miss this?

169
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.560
Can't you just
feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

170
00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.466
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

171
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:24.304
You know,
colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

172
00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:31.845
I'm just saying,
if you go to
the University of Alaska,

173
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.580
I'm never gonna see you.

174
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:40.120
They have a really
great science program.

175
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:42.856
You mean, Edward program?

176
00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:48.495
The way he watches you,

177
00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:50.230
it's like he's willing
to leap in front of you

178
00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.598
and take a bullet or something.

179
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.301
Is that a bad thing?

180
00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:56.536
It's an intense thing.

181
00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:59.873
You're different with him.

182
00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.010
He moves, you move.

183
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.511
Like magnets.

184
00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.381
I don't know, we're just...

185
00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:12.285
In love. I get it.

186
00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:16.356
I just want to
make sure you're making
the right choices for you.

187
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.657
You know, 'cause you're the one

188
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.892
that's gonna have
to live with them.

189
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.365
All right,
enough with the heavy.

190
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.506
Mom.

191
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.608
Congraduation.

192
00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:37.444
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

193
00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:39.112
Ah! I didn't, come on.

194
00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.692
(BOTH LAUGHING)

195
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.962
Are these all our
old trip T-shirts?
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:56.029
Get out!

197
00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:57.664
I saved them all.

198
00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.367
I thought they'd
make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

199
00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:05.172
Remember this one?
Ensenada.

200
00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:08.108
The Snake Pit.
Yeah.

201
00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:10.643
But this one is
my favorite, here.

202
00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:13.046
The three-headed
lobster from Maine.

203
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.414
This is amazing.

204
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:16.049
Honey, I'm glad you like it.

205
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.417
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

206
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.652
have kids, we can add to it.

207
00:15:19.686 --> 00:15:21.521
Maybe go visit
the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

208
00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:22.922
Thanks.
Oh!

209
00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:28.361
I'm glad you like it.

210
00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:31.298
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me
up there in Alaska.

211
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.702
Mom...
Yeah?

212
00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:41.541
I miss you.

213
00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.710
Honey, I miss you, too.

214
00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.031
Are you sure
this is where
you saw her?

215
00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:06.966
She's almost here.

216
00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:21.114
On your left!

217
00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:43.470
(GRUNTING)

218
00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:58.551
Wait!

219
00:16:58.585 --> 00:16:59.752
She's in their territory.

220
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:03.090
She'll get away!

221
00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.159
No, she won't!

222
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:42.795
ESME: Emmett, no!

223
00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:46.566
(GRUNTING)

224
00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:50.437
(GROWLING)

225
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.597
Do you regret going?

226
00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:20.867
No.

227
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:25.305
It was really great
seeing my mom.

228
00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:28.275
Just really hard saying goodbye.

229
00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.277
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

230
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.545
Is that why you asked me to go?

231
00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.882
You thought I was
gonna change my mind?

232
00:18:35.915 --> 00:18:38.185
I'm always hoping for that.

233
00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:41.188
What?

234
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:45.325
If I asked you to stay
in the car, would you?

235
00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:53.200
Of course not.

236
00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:06.713
Hey.

237
00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:09.649
Charlie said you left town.

238
00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:12.852
Yeah.
To visit my mom. Why?

239
00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.488
He's checking to see
if you're still human.

240
00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:19.192
Look, I'm here to warn you.

241
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:20.460
If your kind come
on our land again...

242
00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:22.462
Wait, what?

243
00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:26.733
You didn't tell her?

244
00:19:26.766 --> 00:19:27.834
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

245
00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:32.339
Tell me what?

246
00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:35.375
Emmett and Paul had
a misunderstanding.

247
00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:37.210
It's nothing to worry about.

248
00:19:37.244 --> 00:19:39.246
JACOB: Listen to you.

249
00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:40.813
Did you lie to get
her out of town, too?

250
00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:41.948
You should just leave.

251
00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:44.951
Now.

252
00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:47.720
She has a right to know.

253
00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:49.188
She is the one
the redhead wants.

254
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:52.459
Victoria?

255
00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:55.828
Alice's vision.

256
00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.332
I was trying to protect you.

257
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:00.900
By lying to me.

258
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:06.639
Okay, we're gonna
talk about this, but...

259
00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.641
You.

260
00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:10.910
Why haven't you called me back?

261
00:20:13.613 --> 00:20:15.415
I had nothing to say.

262
00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:19.986
Well, I have tons.
Hold on.
Hey.

263
00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:23.956
Bella.

264
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.658
Edward, you have to trust me.

265
00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:27.927
I do trust you.

266
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.995
It's him I don't trust.

267
00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:43.776
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

268
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.911
Hold on tight.

269
00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:01.561
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

270
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.598
I am the vampire girl, remember?

271
00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.501
Hey, look who's back!

272
00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:09.569
What up, Bella?

273
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.571
Quil? You, too?
Yep.

274
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.905
Finally made the pack.

275
00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.941
EMBRY: I'm glad
you're here, Bella.

276
00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:16.943
Maybe we can get
a break from Jake's
obsessive inner monologue.

277
00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.711
"I wish Bella would call."

278
00:21:18.745 --> 00:21:19.912
"I wish Bella
wouldn't call."

279
00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.581
"Maybe I should call Bella."

280
00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.749
""Maybe I should
call Bella and hang up."

281
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.451
(ALL LAUGHING)

282
00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:26.285
All right, you can shut up now.

283
00:21:29.489 --> 00:21:33.560
Bella,
this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

284
00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:37.029
Hey. I'm really
sorry about your father.

285
00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.298
If you're here to
torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

286
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.003
Fun, isn't she?

287
00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:48.441
Bella, hi!
Hey.

288
00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:50.977
I was wondering
when we'd see your
face around here again.

289
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.712
Yeah. Same here.

290
00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:54.347
Sam, we good?

291
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:56.015
We're good.
She won't be getting

292
00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.517
through our line any time soon.

293
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.419
Cool.
Yeah, that's right boys!

294
00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.798
So when did Leah join the pack?

295
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:16.102
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth,
also phased.

296
00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:20.440
He's only 15,
one of the youngest
we've had.

297
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:24.577
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

298
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:26.078
I wish it was
Leah who'd stay home.

299
00:22:27.614 --> 00:22:29.649
Come on, don't be such a guy.

300
00:22:29.682 --> 00:22:32.519
No, it's not a chick thing.

301
00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:35.922
It's, you know,
a triangle thing.

302
00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:39.426
We all have to live
the Leah/Sam/Emily pain-fest.

303
00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:42.995
Wolf telepathy, remember?

304
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:45.998
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

305
00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:49.569
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself
for hurting Leah.

306
00:22:51.003 --> 00:22:52.905
But Emily was the one.

307
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.009
I guess it sort of
chooses you sometimes.

308
00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:00.947
It's more than
some crush, Bella.

309
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.416
Sam imprinted on Emily.

310
00:23:05.452 --> 00:23:07.520
Do I even want to
know what that is?

311
00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.165
Imprinting on someone is like...

312
00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:23.603
Like when you see her,

313
00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:28.475
everything changes.

314
00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:31.978
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity
holding you to the planet.

315
00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:34.180
It's her.

316
00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:37.149
Nothing else matters.

317
00:23:38.518 --> 00:23:40.419
You would do anything,

318
00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:43.756
be anything for her.

319
00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:49.028
Sounds like you
know the feeling.

320
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.200
Have you

321
00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:58.471
imprinted on someone?

322
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.877
You'd know if I had.

323
00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:12.084
I just have a direct
line to Sam's thoughts.

324
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.055
So for now you're

325
00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:17.223
still you.

326
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.094
And you're still you.

327
00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.230
Yeah.

328
00:24:30.102 --> 00:24:31.470
Until graduation.

329
00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:34.607
Graduation?

330
00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:37.944
You knew this was gonna happen.

331
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:38.978
Not in a month!

332
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:45.585
I mean,
not before you've...
You've even lived.

333
00:24:46.986 --> 00:24:48.855
Or before I could...

334
00:24:48.888 --> 00:24:49.956
(CRASHING)

335
00:24:52.692 --> 00:24:56.095
For a second,
just a second,
I thought...

336
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.533
But he's got his
hooks in you so deep...

337
00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:03.970
I decided this, not him.

338
00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:06.172
Bella, they're not even alive.

339
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:08.808
It makes me sick.

340
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:14.280
Better you really be
dead than one of them.

341
00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:29.028
I can't believe you said that.

342
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:36.102
Edward was right,
I shouldn't have come.

343
00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:38.905
Bella, come on. Please.

344
00:25:41.974 --> 00:25:43.242
I'm sorry.

345
00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:57.216
You know,
Edward could at least
respect meal times.

346
00:26:58.217 --> 00:26:59.251
I was just with Jake.

347
00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:01.320
Oh.

348
00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:04.223
Good.

349
00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:05.257
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

350
00:27:08.728 --> 00:27:11.731
I'll just give you
two some privacy, then.

351
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.335
Hey.
Do you understand
how worried I've been?

352
00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:18.037
I was perfectly safe.

353
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.039
I almost broke
the treaty to make sure.

354
00:27:21.307 --> 00:27:22.909
I know I smell like a dog.
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:22.942 --> 00:27:24.276
No, something's wrong.

356
00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.285
Edward, what's wrong?

357
00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:35.187
Someone's been in here.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:44.096
DR. CULLEN: Who was it?
Someone we know?

359
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.066
This stranger,
I didn't recognize
his scent.

360
00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.001
A nomad passing through?

361
00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:51.470
A passerby
wouldn't have left
Bella's father alive.

362
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:56.042
The scent disappeared
about five miles south
of Bella's house.

363
00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:58.010
Someone's orchestrating this.

364
00:27:58.044 --> 00:28:00.046
Victoria?

365
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:01.848
I would have seen her decide.

366
00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:03.449
Has to be the Volturi.

367
00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:06.352
I don't think it's
the Volturi, either.

368
00:28:06.385 --> 00:28:08.087
I've been watching
Aro's decisions, too.

369
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.789
EMMETT: So we keep looking.

370
00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:12.324
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

371
00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:14.226
Another protection detail?

372
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.427
DR. CULLEN: Rosalie.

373
00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:18.264
No, she's right.

374
00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:22.769
You can't protect me,
watch my dad and search
for the intruder.

375
00:28:22.802 --> 00:28:24.403
And for Victoria.

376
00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.338
And keep yourselves fed.

377
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.207
I'm not leaving
you here defenseless.

378
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.243
Well, I'm not gonna
let you starve.

379
00:28:31.277 --> 00:28:33.145
And I wouldn't be
unprotected. I have...

380
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:36.382
EDWARD: What?

381
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.493
Whoever it was,
he left his stink behind.

382
00:28:47.526 --> 00:28:51.864
It'll be hard to miss
when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.

383
00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:54.166
We don't need you
to handle anything.

384
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.367
Or anyone.

385
00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.038
I could care less what you need.

386
00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:01.874
Okay, great.
Then we'll all
work together.

387
00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:07.146
Come on.
We've all got
the same goals here, right?

388
00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:09.515
To catch the bad vampires.

389
00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:12.484
Like there's a difference.

390
00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:14.987
All right, we're done here.

391
00:29:15.021 --> 00:29:16.422
No, you're done here.
Stop!

392
00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:19.458
Let go!

393
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:22.528
I'm tired of this.
From now on,
I'm Switzerland, okay?

394
00:29:25.531 --> 00:29:29.368
I know you guys
don't like each other.
But we've got bigger problems.

395
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:31.437
Lots of them.

396
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.873
And this is just one
temporary solution.

397
00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:37.343
If you'd be willing to try.

399
00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:44.984
but it wasn't
about rivalry anymore.

400
00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:49.188
It was about my safety,
and Charlie's.

401
00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:53.125
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least
try to work together.

402
00:29:58.364 --> 00:30:01.233
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

403
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:06.005
It wasn't exactly
an easy alliance.

405
00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:12.111
ANGELA: The University
of Washington sent me

406
00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:14.146
and Eric our dorm
assignments yesterday.

407
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.949
I'm in the furthest dorm
from campus.

408
00:30:16.983 --> 00:30:18.885
Eric's in
the closest one, of course.

409
00:30:25.224 --> 00:30:26.325
Is something wrong?

410
00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:29.361
No. Why?

411
00:30:31.063 --> 00:30:33.933
Well, one,
Edward's always with you...

412
00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.968
And, two,
you keep looking
out that window...

413
00:30:36.002 --> 00:30:38.971
Like you're hoping
he'll show up and
serenade you or something.

414
00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:39.838
Doubtful.

415
00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:43.943
Okay. You don't
have to talk about it.

416
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:47.346
No, it's nothing.

417
00:30:51.017 --> 00:30:52.218
I mean, it is, but...

418
00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:56.355
Okay.

419
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.892
You remember Jacob Black.

420
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.232
Oh. Okay, so,
Edward's jealous.

421
00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:07.333
You say that like
it's really obvious.

422
00:31:08.334 --> 00:31:09.902
Isn't it?

423
00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:17.243
I've seen the way
Jacob looks at you.
Edward's seen it, too.

424
00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:20.079
He's only human.
He's going to act
like any other guy.

425
00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:25.384
I think it's
a little more complicated.

426
00:31:26.585 --> 00:31:30.156
Say the word, Bella.
"Jealousy."

427
00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:32.358
I've told Jake how I feel.
He understands.

428
00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:35.161
Hmm. Okay.
So the word is "denial."

429
00:31:37.263 --> 00:31:38.630
Are you saying I'm an idiot?

430
00:31:38.664 --> 00:31:40.566
No, just a little oblivious.

431
00:31:45.972 --> 00:31:48.640

432
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.677

don't worry about it.
It'll work itself out.

You should go.

I'm not gonna be gone long.

439
00:32:28.247 --> 00:32:30.482
Don't rush.
You need to hunt.

440
00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:49.035

and Sue Clearwater.

Harry when he died.

You're okay. I thought...

453
00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:43.622
I mean, they thought
it would be good for you
to hear the histories.

454
00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:46.158
The histories?

455
00:33:46.192 --> 00:33:49.695
The tribe's histories?
Aren't they secret?

hear them, too.

that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

476
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:55.727
This enabled us to
scare off our enemies

477
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:58.130
and protect our tribe.

478
00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:04.536

across a creature.

00:38:48.427 --> 00:38:50.496
What, like new vampires?

533
00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:52.598
In the first few months
after the change.

534
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:55.801
That's when
we're at our most
uncontrollable. Vicious.

535
00:38:56.802 --> 00:38:59.070
Insane with thirst.

536
00:38:59.104 --> 00:39:01.440
Something to look forward to.

537
00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:05.977
No one's trained
these newborns,
but this isn't random.

538
00:39:07.112 --> 00:39:09.648
Someone's creating an army.

539
00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:11.650
Well, now we're
definitely going to Seattle.

540
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:14.786
An army of vampires?

541
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.555
And they've been
created to fight someone.

542
00:39:16.588 --> 00:39:18.123
We're the only clan
even close to Seattle.

543
00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:19.958
DR. CULLEN:
Regardless of why
they were made,

544
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.161
if we don't put
a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

545
00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.096
I'm surprised they've
let it go on this long.

546
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.632
Maybe they're behind it.

547
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:30.802
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

548
00:39:30.836 --> 00:39:32.604
He wants me and
Alice to join him.

549
00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:35.006
He thinks our gifts
would add to his power.

550
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.575
But he knows
we'll never choose him

551
00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:38.176
as long as our
family's still alive.

552
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:40.746
An army could
solve that for him.

553
00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:45.984
Edward, I don't think
we should wait
until graduation.

554
00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:46.985
I think you
should change me now.

555
00:39:47.018 --> 00:39:49.154
Bella, no.

556
00:39:49.187 --> 00:39:51.690
I'm a liability now.
I could be an asset.

557
00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.726
You'd be a bigger liability
as a newborn.

558
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.930
Unable to
control your instincts.
An easy target.

559
00:39:58.964 --> 00:40:02.200
There's also your
father to consider.
And your mother.

560
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:05.437
Imagine how terrible
it would be for them
if you suddenly disappear.

561
00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:10.476
But we're still going to
kick someone's ass, right?

562
00:40:16.682 --> 00:40:17.916
Hey.

563
00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:20.586
Did you eat dinner yet?

564
00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:24.089
No, I haven't.

565
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.826
(CHARLIE SIGHS)

566
00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:31.797
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

567
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:34.833
and his poor parents
have been papering

568
00:40:34.866 --> 00:40:36.468
Seattle with these
things ever since.

569
00:40:38.837 --> 00:40:40.038
You think they
should just give up?

570
00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:45.677
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

571
00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:49.515
Not ever.

572
00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:59.024
BELLA: I have to figure out
what to tell people.

573
00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:02.127
Why I won't be
home for Christmases,

574
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.229
and why I won't visit,

575
00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:09.134
why they'll never see me again.

576
00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.671
After a few decades,
everyone you know
will be dead.

577
00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:16.742
Problem solved.

578
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.883
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

579
00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:26.585
I've told you.

580
00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.590
Be honest with me.

581
00:41:32.791 --> 00:41:34.926
There's more.

582
00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.097
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

583
00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:45.671
I've lived through it.

584
00:41:47.673 --> 00:41:50.175
And to let you suffer that...

585
00:41:51.843 --> 00:41:55.513
You believe I have a soul,
and I don't.

586
00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.786
But to risk yours,

587
00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:03.589
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

588
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:08.126
that's the most
selfish thing I'll ever do.

589
00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:16.534
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

590
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:23.909
You know,
like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

591
00:42:33.785 --> 00:42:35.286
You'll always be my Bella.

592
00:42:57.175 --> 00:42:59.344
My Bella, just less fragile.

593
00:43:10.856 --> 00:43:12.624
BELLA: Gosh,
it's so pretty here.

594
00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:21.266
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

595
00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.702
Which you're invited to.

596
00:43:28.139 --> 00:43:30.876
Yeah, I figured that.

597
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:39.785
What?

598
00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:44.790
I just wanted to
do this differently.

599
00:43:44.823 --> 00:43:46.024
Smoother.

600
00:43:47.726 --> 00:43:49.728
But now I'm out of time.

601
00:43:50.996 --> 00:43:53.131
Do what?

602
00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:56.401
You need to hear
the truth, Bella,

603
00:43:56.434 --> 00:43:58.636
understand all your options.

604
00:44:00.338 --> 00:44:01.973
And you need to know

605
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.777
that I'm in love with you,

606
00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:10.281
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

607
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.720
I thought you understood.

608
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:18.757
I don't feel that way for you.

609
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:19.991
I don't buy it.

610
00:44:20.025 --> 00:44:21.793
What don't you buy?

611
00:44:23.228 --> 00:44:25.463
That's how I feel.

612
00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:28.934
You feel
something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

613
00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.170
So I'm not giving up.

614
00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.173
I'm gonna fight for you

615
00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:41.146
until your heart stops beating.

616
00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:43.481
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

617
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.316
You're rushing into it
because you're afraid
you'll change your mind.

618
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.818
No, I'm not.

619
00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:50.021
I know what I want.

620
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:55.293
You wouldn't have to
change for me, Bella,

621
00:44:55.326 --> 00:44:58.764
or say goodbye to anybody.

622
00:44:58.797 --> 00:45:02.333
I can give you more than him.

623
00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:06.271
I mean, he probably
can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

624
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.074
Feel that?

625
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.077
Flesh and blood.

626
00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:14.479
And warmth.

00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:30.728
God!

630
00:45:38.303 --> 00:45:40.071
Edward!

631
00:45:40.105 --> 00:45:41.773
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

632
00:45:41.807 --> 00:45:42.941
Don't do this here!

633
00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:44.342
She's not sure what she wants.

634
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.510
Don't do this here!
Let me give you a clue.

635
00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:46.945
Wait for her to say the words.

636
00:45:46.978 --> 00:45:49.380
Fine! And she will.

637
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:51.049
Jacob, just go, okay?

638
00:45:51.082 --> 00:45:54.185
CHARLIE: Hey, hey, hey!
Easy, guys. Easy.

639
00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:56.754
Let's take it down a notch.
All right?

640
00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:01.126
What's going on?

641
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:06.131
I kissed Bella.

642
00:46:10.535 --> 00:46:12.037
And she broke her hand.

643
00:46:14.439 --> 00:46:15.506
Punching my face.

644
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:19.110
Total misunderstanding.

645
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.414
DR. CULLEN:
It's just a sprain.

646
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:25.483
It should heal fairly quickly.

647
00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:31.356
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

648
00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:33.224
I punched
a werewolf in the face.

649
00:46:33.258 --> 00:46:36.527
Badass.
You're gonna be one
tough little newborn.

650
00:46:37.996 --> 00:46:39.430
Tough enough to take you on.

651
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:47.172
Don't worry about it.

652
00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:52.911
Got any leads?

653
00:46:52.944 --> 00:46:56.948
No sign of the intruder.
But Victoria continues
to make appearances.

654
00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.858
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of
becoming a newborn.

655
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:12.830
Okay...

656
00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:15.133
Rosalie,

657
00:47:17.402 --> 00:47:20.205
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

658
00:47:20.238 --> 00:47:21.372
Hate...

659
00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.609
I don't hate you.

660
00:47:28.113 --> 00:47:30.848
I don't particularly
like you, but...

661
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:37.255
Bella, I envy you.

662
00:47:38.256 --> 00:47:39.590
What?

663
00:47:41.026 --> 00:47:42.193
That's ridiculous.

664
00:47:42.227 --> 00:47:43.228
No, it's not.

665
00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:47.265
You have a choice.

666
00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:49.667
I didn't.

667
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:54.405
None of us did.
But you do,
and you're choosing wrong.

668
00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:57.208
I don't care
how miserable
your human life is.

669
00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.912
My life is not miserable.

670
00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:07.518
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

671
00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:08.653
Mine was.

672
00:48:09.654 --> 00:48:11.622
Absolutely perfect.

673
00:48:13.524 --> 00:48:16.561
There were things
I still wanted,

674
00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:18.329
to be married, with a nice house

675
00:48:18.363 --> 00:48:20.231
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home.

676
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.136
Mostly, I wanted a baby.

677
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:26.537
He never cries.

678
00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:27.605
ROSALIE: So much.

679
00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:30.075
And he sleeps all night.

680
00:48:30.108 --> 00:48:33.278
Are you just
the best little boy ever?

681
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:36.147
ROSALIE: Royce King was
the most eligible bachelor
in town.

682
00:48:37.348 --> 00:48:39.084
I barely knew him.

683
00:48:43.688 --> 00:48:47.225
But I was young.
I was in love with
the idea of love.

684
00:48:49.227 --> 00:48:52.530
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

685
00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:54.099
I wasn't far from home.

686
00:48:54.132 --> 00:48:55.666
There she is.

687
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.702
Hey, Rose!

688
00:48:57.735 --> 00:49:00.171
Come over here!
Here. Hold this.

689
00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:03.274
Hey, come over here.

690
00:49:03.308 --> 00:49:05.476
We've been waiting for you.

691
00:49:06.511 --> 00:49:08.046
There she is.

692
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.349
Royce. Royce!

(MEN LAUGHING)

694
00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:14.519
You're drunk.

695
00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:18.289
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

696
00:49:18.323 --> 00:49:21.026
It's hard to say with
all those clothes on.

697
00:49:21.059 --> 00:49:22.994
What do you say, Rose?

698
00:49:23.028 --> 00:49:25.196
Why don't we take
off a few layers?
Stop it, stop it.

699
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.065
Stop. Stop!

700
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.069
I'll see you tomorrow.

701
00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:32.303
Sober.

702
00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:35.373
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

703
00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:36.574
I said, get...
Come back... Hey!

704
00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:38.043
Stop! Stop! Get off me!

705
00:49:38.076 --> 00:49:39.677
You'll do as I say!
Let go of me! Stop!

706
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.113
Stop! Let go! Stop!

how the newborns
differ from us.

stronger than us

doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

but no human army
could stand against them.

877
01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:45.069
Now, the two most
important things
to remember are, first,

878
01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:48.172
never let them get
their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

879
01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.840
And second,

880
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.844
never go for the obvious kill.

881
01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:58.282
They'll be expecting that,

882
01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:00.450
and you will lose.

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:03.253

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:11.962
Don't hold back.

885
01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:13.197
Not in my nature.

886
01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.513
Never lose focus.

887
01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.037
One more thing.

888
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.505
Never turn your back
on your enemy.

889
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.122
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

890
01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:50.928
Some of you could get
killed because of me.

891
01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.134
It's gonna be
100 times worse
than this, right?

892
01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:21.258
Done for the day.

893
01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.940
Jasper?

894
01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:42.179
Are you sure
there's nothing
I can do to help?

895
01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.582
Well, your presence alone,
your scent,
will distract the newborns.

896
01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:49.519
Their hunting
instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

897
01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:53.123
Good. I'm glad.

898
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:58.628
Hey. How do you know
so much about this?

899
01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:04.901
I didn't have quite
the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

900
01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:12.676
Those bites are like mine.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:19.516
All the training
the Confederate Army
gave me

903
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.953
was useless
against the newborns.

904
01:05:22.987 --> 01:05:25.489
Still, I never lost a fight.

905
01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.598
This happened
during the Civil War?

906
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.401
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

907
01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.170
all without having
seen any real battle.

908
01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.238
Until?

909
01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.109
Till I met a certain immortal.

910
01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:47.511
Maria.

911
01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:54.018
I was riding back to Galveston

912
01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:56.320
after evacuating a column
of women and children

913
01:05:57.321 --> 01:05:58.388
when I saw them.

914
01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:01.358
I immediately
offered them my aid.

915
01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.668
Lovely. And an officer.

I can never stop

Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

920
01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.058
I hope you survive.

921
01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.994
You may be of great use to me.

922
01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.202
Maria was creating an army?

923
01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.604
They were very
common in the South.

924
01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:51.408
There were
constant brutal battles
for territory.

925
01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:54.344
Maria won them all.

926
01:06:54.378 --> 01:06:59.015
She was smart, careful,
and she had me.

928
01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.588
I was her second in command.

929
01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:07.491
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

930
01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.228

let them live
beyond their first year.

934
01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.174
It was my job to
dispose of them.

and I had was love.

But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

I didn't know
there was another way

940
01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:16.326
till I found Alice.

941
01:08:18.262 --> 01:08:21.231
Now, she'd seen me
coming, of course.

that I have to hide

or it's so easy
that you're gonna be

Edward and I are
going to a campsite.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:52.776
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick
up on our scents.

Your stench, however,
is revolting.

Dude, you really
don't wanna start
comparing stinks.

991
01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.082
What he means is that your scent

992
01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.517
will mask mine if you carry me.

993
01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.052
Done.

994
01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.921
This is not a good idea.

want to get anywhere
near his odor.

to sit out of the fight, too?

Or don't you care
about my safety?

1001

Of course, I care.
But you'd say no.

I won't have a choice, anyways.

1003

Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with
the shots he calls.

Since you let Sam be alpha?

1005
01:12:48.164 --> 01:12:51.635

let alone be its leader.

have to accept mine.

at a time.

Well, I'm not a wolf.
I can't imprint.

1016
01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:24.434
It has nothing to do
with imprinting.

1017
01:13:24.468 --> 01:13:28.505
It has to do with
feeling something
for somebody.

1018
01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:30.774
And I know you
feel something for me.

1019
01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:35.178
I can sense how I make
you feel, physically.

1020
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.815

kiss you again
till you asked.

keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

marriage has value.

1058
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.759
When you're older.

1059
01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.028
Much older.

1060
01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:09.332
Like your mother.

1061
01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.801
It seemed to work out
fine for her the
second time around,

1062
01:16:11.835 --> 01:16:13.102
later in life.

1063
01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:14.604
Yeah, I guess.

1064
01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.743
I mean,
you definitely don't wanna

1065
01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.344
have to get married
because you weren't

1066
01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:24.013
careful.

1067
01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.851
What?

1068
01:16:27.884 --> 01:16:29.352
Look, you know what
I'm talking about.

1069
01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:32.321
There's things you
need to think about

1070
01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.223
if you're gonna be
physically intimate.

1071
01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:37.093
Okay.
Don't have "the talk"
with me, please.

1072
01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:39.328
Well, it's just as
embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

1073
01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:41.898
I doubt that.

1074
01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.667
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you
to it like 10 years ago.

1075
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.635
Well, you didn't
have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

1076
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:47.737
I'm sure things
work the same way.

1077
01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.775
All right, so...

1078
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.279
You guys are taking
precautions and...

1079
01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:59.148
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry
about that.

1080
01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.252
Edward is old school.

1081
01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:09.358
Old school.
Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

1082
01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:11.728
Oh, my God.
Dad. I'm a virgin.

1083
01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:13.229
(STAMMERING)

1084
01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:16.700
Okay! Good.
Glad we covered that.
Me, too.

1085
01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.371
Virgin.

1086
01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:26.275
I'm liking Edward
a little bit more now.

1087
01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:39.388
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

1088
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.891
Nothing.

1089
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.680
It seems only fair
that I be represented,
as well.

1090
01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:10.920
It's really pretty.

1091
01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:13.189
Thanks.

1092
01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:23.066
There's a bed.

1093
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.803
I thought you might
need one to sleep in.

1094
01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:31.908
I think an air mattress
would have sufficed.

1095
01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:33.042
Is this too much?

1096
01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:35.979
No.

1097
01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:37.781
No, it's perfect.

1098
01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:41.050
I wanna ask you something.

1099
01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.119
Anything.

1100
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:50.193
Okay, marriage is
the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

1101
01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.230
Yes.

1102
01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.236
Okay. I wanna
negotiate my own condition.

1103
01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:04.874
Anything you want.
It's yours.

1104
01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.344
You promise?

1105
01:19:09.913 --> 01:19:10.980
Yeah.

1106
01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:16.319
Okay.

1107
01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:23.993
Hey.

1108
01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:34.037
Bella.

1109
01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:36.172
No.

1110
01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:37.373
But you said that you wanted me

1111
01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:38.842
to have every human experience.

1112
01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.210
Not ones that will
risk killing you.

1113
01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:42.812
You won't.

1114
01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.049
And everyone says
once I'm changed

1115
01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:47.216
all I'll want is to
slaughter the whole town.

1116
01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.119
That part doesn't last forever.

1117
01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:51.888
I want you.

1118
01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:58.327
While I'm still me.
While I still
want you this way.

1119
01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:05.869
It's too dangerous.

1120
01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:08.371
Try. Just try.

1121
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.876
I'll go to some
ridiculously expensive

1122
01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:15.478
college and let you
buy me a car.

1123
01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:17.813
I'll marry you. Just try.

1124
01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:01.457
Stop trying to
take your clothes off.

1125
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:03.059
You wanna do that part?

1126
01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.227
Not tonight.

1127
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:25.982
You...

1128
01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:31.220
You mean, you don't...

1129
01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.323
That's fine.

1130
01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:40.029
Believe me, I want to.

1131
01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:43.933
I just want to be
married to you first.

1132
01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.973
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1133
01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.976
trying to steal your
virtue or something.

1134
01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:57.380
It's not my virtue
I'm concerned about.

1135
01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:02.318
Are you kidding?

1136
01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:06.055
It's just one rule
I wanna leave unbroken.

1137
01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:12.128
It might be too
late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1138
01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:16.165
I know that's not
a modern notion.

1139
01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:19.235
It's not modern.
It's ancient.

1140
01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.407
I'm from a different era.

1141
01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.279
Things were a lot
less complicated.

1142
01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:36.986
And if I'd have
met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1143
01:22:39.522 --> 01:22:44.360
We'd have taken
chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1144
01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:58.741
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1145
01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:04.047
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1146
01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:07.450
I would have got
down on one knee,

1147
01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:17.293
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1148
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.501
This was my mother's.

1149
01:23:30.273 --> 01:23:36.179
Isabella Swan,
I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1150
01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:39.548
And would you do me
the extraordinary
honor of marrying me?

1151
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:46.789
Yes.

1152
01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.746
You're not coming with us?

1153
01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:21.824
It'll be a last minute decision.

1154
01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:26.595
I told you how it works.

1155
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:30.566
The Cullens have powers.

1156
01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:36.239
Don't underestimate
them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1157
01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:41.144
but they'll be able
to anticipate your
every move.

1158
01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:43.879
According to your friend?

1159
01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.814
Yes.

1160
01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:48.784
My dead friend.

1161
01:24:51.887 --> 01:24:54.823
Laurent found out
about the things
they could do,

1162
01:24:56.759 --> 01:24:58.661
and they killed him.

1163
01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:02.731
But not before he told me.

1164
01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:09.705
Maybe he was wrong.

1165
01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:20.683
I mean, this is supposed
to be Cullen territory.

1166
01:25:20.716 --> 01:25:24.320
We've been tearing it up
and I've never
even seen them here.

1167
01:25:25.488 --> 01:25:27.122
You don't trust me.

1168
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.759
With my life.
I'm just saying...

1169
01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:33.229
I'm doing this for us.

1170
01:25:33.262 --> 01:25:38.367
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1171
01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:41.804
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1172
01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:43.606
I won't let them.

1173
01:25:44.907 --> 01:25:49.545
I am going to end
the Cullen clan.

1174
01:25:52.548 --> 01:25:53.816
I swear.

1175
01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:14.337
I love you so much.

1176
01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:37.260
You're going overboard.

1177
01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:39.695
If this is all
I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1178
01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:41.830
The newborns'll be frantic.

1179
01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:47.603
It's okay. Don't make
yourself uncomfortable.

1180
01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:48.837
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1181
01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:52.708
Since when?

1182
01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:55.644
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1183
01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:59.515
You're not wearing your ring.

1184
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.386
Well, I didn't want
to risk losing it.

1185
01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:06.755
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1186
01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.295
I think we should
wait to tell him.

1187
01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:14.263
I mean, at least
till after the fight.

1188
01:27:14.297 --> 01:27:15.431
If you're having
second thoughts...

1189
01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:16.765
I'm not.

1190
01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:18.901
I just want him to
have a clear head.

1191
01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:20.769
Whose head is unclear?

1192
01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:24.006
Nobody's I hope.

1193
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:26.642
Alice says
there's a storm coming.

1194
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:27.976
Yeah, I can feel it.

1195
01:27:29.345 --> 01:27:32.448
We should get going.

1196
01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:34.617
I'll see you in
a couple of hours.

1197
01:27:43.826 --> 01:27:45.361
Something up?

1198
01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:50.333
Bunch of vampires
trying to kill me.

1199
01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.000
Same old same old.

1200
01:29:09.912 --> 01:29:11.079
Thank you.

1201
01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:15.150
You should get back
before the storm hits.

1202
01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.553
No, I'm staying.

1203
01:29:17.586 --> 01:29:18.987
You'll need my connection
to the pack

1204
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.155
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1205
01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.690
You're not gonna fight?

1206
01:29:21.724 --> 01:29:24.460
Seth will spell me
in the morning.

1207
01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:26.429
He's not happy
about missing the action

1208
01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:27.896
but it'll keep him
out of trouble.

1209
01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:30.433
Let's get you inside.

1210
01:29:43.746 --> 01:29:45.013
(WHIMPERING)

1211
01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:51.186
I should have
chosen a site lower down.

1212
01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.589
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1213
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:56.058
What can I do?

1214
01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.131
(WIND HOWLING)

1215
01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:12.107
I can't sleep
with all that teeth
chattering going on.

1216
01:30:19.515 --> 01:30:21.116
Forget it.

1217
01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:24.987
She may need her toes someday.

1218
01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:28.423
And let's face it,
I am hotter than you.

1219
01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:35.898
Get your hand off me.

1220
01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.767
Keep your hands off her.

1221
01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:40.168
Don't fight.

1222
01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:45.541
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1223
01:31:02.525 --> 01:31:05.794
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1224
01:31:05.828 --> 01:31:09.164
Relax.
You'll warm up soon.

1225
01:31:10.866 --> 01:31:13.268
Faster if you took
your clothes off.

1226
01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.870
Jake.

1227
01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:16.038
Survival 101.

1228
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:50.973
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1229
01:31:53.676 --> 01:31:56.945
I really get under
that ice-cold skin
of yours, don't I?

1230
01:31:59.214 --> 01:32:01.750
What?

1231
01:32:01.784 --> 01:32:04.119
Are you doubting
her feelings for you?

1232
01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:07.890
Nice.

1233
01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:11.860
So picking
through my brain's okay,

1234
01:32:11.894 --> 01:32:14.563
but letting me
into yours, forget it.

1235
01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:19.534
Look.

1236
01:32:21.236 --> 01:32:22.705
I know she's in love with you.

1237
01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:24.740
Good.

1238
01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:26.975
But she's in love with me, too.

1239
01:32:29.344 --> 01:32:31.747
She just won't
admit it to herself.

1240
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:37.185
I can't tell if you're right.

1241
01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:40.188
Then let me ask you something.

1242
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:42.257
If she chooses me...

1243
01:32:43.258 --> 01:32:44.660
She won't.

1244
01:32:44.693 --> 01:32:45.894
If she did,

1245
01:32:47.763 --> 01:32:49.031
would you try to kill me?

1246
01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:52.768
That's an intriguing idea.

1247
01:32:57.806 --> 01:33:02.244
But, no. I couldn't
hurt her like that.

1248
01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:05.814
So you'd just turn her
into a blood-sucking
demon like you?

1249
01:33:05.848 --> 01:33:08.951
I don't want that.
I never wanted that.

1250
01:33:08.984 --> 01:33:10.085
So stop her.

1251
01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:11.586
I tried.

1252
01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:14.723
I left.

1253
01:33:14.757 --> 01:33:15.924
But you gave up too quickly.

1254
01:33:18.193 --> 01:33:22.665
If you'd stayed
away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1255
01:33:23.666 --> 01:33:26.669
Trust me.

1256
01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:31.206
You have to consider
that I might be better
for her than you are.

1257
01:33:34.009 --> 01:33:35.811
I have considered that.

1258
01:33:39.848 --> 01:33:41.684
I know you can protect her.

1259
01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:49.157
But you can give her a life,
a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1260
01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.763
But I'm not...

1261
01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:57.733
I'm not going to force her
into anything ever again.

1262
01:34:00.302 --> 01:34:03.706
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1263
01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:08.243
Yeah. That I remember.

1264
01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:14.750
When you thought she was gone,

1265
01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:18.854
that you'd lost her,

1266
01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:24.259
how did you cope?

1267
01:34:26.194 --> 01:34:28.063
There are no words.

1268
01:34:34.236 --> 01:34:36.739
But I wouldn't wish
it on anyone, Jacob.

1269
01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:42.811
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1270
01:34:43.812 --> 01:34:46.314
Meaning,

1271
01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:48.984
"As much as I'd
love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1272
01:34:52.254 --> 01:34:55.057
If we weren't natural enemies

1273
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:57.893
and you weren't
trying to steal
my reason for existing,

1274
01:34:59.394 --> 01:35:01.363
I might actually like you.

1275
01:35:02.364 --> 01:35:05.400
Well,

1276
01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:09.337
if you weren't
planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1277
01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:11.740
I might...

1278
01:35:18.947 --> 01:35:22.017
No. Not even then.

1279
01:35:30.358 --> 01:35:33.728
But she could
still change her mind,
you know.

1280
01:35:40.435 --> 01:35:41.870
Then I'd let her go.

1281
01:36:01.957 --> 01:36:03.425
Right. Hey, Seth.

1282
01:36:06.962 --> 01:36:11.934
Where's Jacob?
Did he already...
Not yet.

1283
01:36:11.967 --> 01:36:15.203
He's checking to see
if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1284
01:36:22.878 --> 01:36:24.512
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1285
01:36:24.546 --> 01:36:26.548
That couldn't have
been easy on you.

1286
01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:29.451
It definitely
won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1287
01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:32.554
You have a list?

1288
01:36:32.587 --> 01:36:34.422
All 10 I spent with you.

1289
01:36:36.224 --> 01:36:40.462
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1290
01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:48.170
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to
hyphenate my name.

1291
01:36:49.171 --> 01:36:50.939
You're marrying him?

1292
01:36:50.973 --> 01:36:52.507
Jake, I...

1293
01:36:57.012 --> 01:36:58.413
You knew he was listening!

1294
01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.616
He deserves to know.

1295
01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.285
Jake, stop!
Bella, let him...

1296
01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:04.519
Don't!

1297
01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:08.823
Jake, stop!

1298
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.229
Jake, please!

1299
01:37:14.262 --> 01:37:15.597
I'm done! I'm so done!

1300
01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:19.501
What can I do?

1301
01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:22.905
You can't do anything.
I can, by going out there
and killing something.

1302
01:37:22.938 --> 01:37:25.507
No! You're not
thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1303
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.243
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1304
01:37:28.276 --> 01:37:30.578
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1305
01:37:32.414 --> 01:37:33.882
Why?

1306
01:37:35.483 --> 01:37:37.252
Give me one good reason.

1307
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:40.322
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1308
01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:43.325
It's not good enough.

1309
01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.594
Because you're too important.

1310
01:37:50.165 --> 01:37:51.934
Still not good enough.

1311
01:37:51.967 --> 01:37:53.535
Jacob!

1312
01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.041
Kiss me.

1313
01:38:02.544 --> 01:38:05.880
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1314
01:38:53.996 --> 01:38:56.298
That should have
been our first kiss.

1315
01:39:02.037 --> 01:39:03.305
I gotta go.

1316
01:39:06.374 --> 01:39:07.642
I'll be back.

1317
01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:39.541
You saw.

1318
01:39:39.574 --> 01:39:41.209
No, but...

1319
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:44.046
Jacob's thoughts
are pretty loud.

1320
01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.115
I don't know what happened.

1321
01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:50.552
You love him.

1322
01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:56.524
I love you more.

1323
01:39:57.525 --> 01:39:58.760
I know.

1324
01:40:01.663 --> 01:40:03.398
When I left...

1325
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.602
I left you bleeding.

1326
01:40:07.635 --> 01:40:09.037
And Jacob stitched you up.

1327
01:40:11.273 --> 01:40:12.407
Just left his
mark on both of you.

1328
01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.510
And that's my fault.

1329
01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:17.145
Don't blame yourself.

1330
01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.482
I just want you to be happy.

1331
01:40:22.117 --> 01:40:23.518

I can hear her thoughts.

Seth, go.

1345
01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:59.707
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1346
01:42:59.741 --> 01:43:02.444
She knew you'd be with me.

1347

She knows I'll kill you.

1352
01:43:31.773 --> 01:43:35.977
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to
deal with you anymore.

1353
01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:40.615
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about
their mind tricks.

1354
01:43:40.648 --> 01:43:44.752
I can read her mind.
So I know what
she thinks of you.

She only created you
and this army

1357
01:43:48.923 --> 01:43:52.527
to avenge her true mate, James.

1358
01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.363

We'll take him back to Billy's.

1406
01:49:14.982 --> 01:49:16.784
I'll be there soon as I can.

1407
01:49:16.818 --> 01:49:17.819
Hang in there, Jake.

1408
01:49:25.192 --> 01:49:27.061
(GROANING)

1409
01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:30.031
It's okay. We got you.

1410
01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:31.165
We got you.

1411
01:49:32.166 --> 01:49:33.567
They're coming.

1412
01:49:55.056 --> 01:49:57.158
Impressive.

1413
01:49:57.191 --> 01:50:00.995
I've never seen a coven
escape an assault
of this magnitude intact.

1414
01:50:01.028 --> 01:50:02.664
We were lucky.

1415
01:50:04.065 --> 01:50:05.733
I doubt that.

1416
01:50:07.769 --> 01:50:09.370
It appears we missed
an entertaining fight.

1417
01:50:10.371 --> 01:50:12.039
JANE: Yes.

1418
01:50:12.073 --> 01:50:14.676
It's not often we're
rendered unnecessary.

1419
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:15.943
If you'd arrived
a half hour ago,

1420
01:50:15.977 --> 01:50:17.178
you would have
fulfilled your purpose.

1421
01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.014
Pity.

1422
01:50:23.818 --> 01:50:25.252
You missed one.

1423
01:50:32.426 --> 01:50:34.729
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1424
01:50:36.163 --> 01:50:37.799
That wasn't yours to offer.

1425
01:50:41.068 --> 01:50:42.069
Why did you come?

1426
01:50:44.038 --> 01:50:45.039
(SCREAMING)

1427
01:50:48.342 --> 01:50:49.811
Who created you?

1428
01:50:49.844 --> 01:50:51.946
(SCREAMING)

1429
01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:54.048
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything
you want to know.

1430
01:50:55.082 --> 01:50:56.217
I know.

1431
01:50:58.452 --> 01:51:02.189
I don't know!
Riley wouldn't tell us.

1432
01:51:03.424 --> 01:51:05.727
He said our thoughts
weren't safe.

1433
01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:09.897
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1434
01:51:09.931 --> 01:51:12.333
DR. CULLEN:
Edward, if the Volturi
had knowledge

1435
01:51:12.366 --> 01:51:14.301
of Victoria,
they would have stopped her.

1436
01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:16.771
Isn't that right, Jane?

1437
01:51:19.106 --> 01:51:20.674
Of course.

1438
01:51:22.076 --> 01:51:24.812
Felix.

1439
01:51:24.846 --> 01:51:25.947
She didn't know
what she was doing.

1440
01:51:28.015 --> 01:51:30.885
We'll take
responsibility for her.

1441
01:51:30.918 --> 01:51:32.419
Give her a chance.

1442
01:51:35.356 --> 01:51:41.996
The Volturi don't
give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1443
01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:45.032
Caius will be
interested to know
that she's still human.

1444
01:51:45.066 --> 01:51:47.034
The date is set.

1445
01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:53.074
Take care of that, Felix.
I'd like to go home.

1446
01:52:09.223 --> 01:52:10.792
(SCREAMING)

1447
01:52:21.435 --> 01:52:22.804
Hey.
(JACOB SCREAMING)

1448
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:30.477
It's been going on for a while.

1449
01:52:30.511 --> 01:52:32.246
Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1450
01:52:32.279 --> 01:52:34.148
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1451
01:52:34.181 --> 01:52:35.783
Give it a rest, Leah.

1452
01:52:42.289 --> 01:52:43.958
The worst is over.
He'll be all right.

1453
01:52:44.959 --> 01:52:46.360
I gave him some morphine,

1454
01:52:46.393 --> 01:52:48.562
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1455
01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:51.165
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1456
01:52:51.198 --> 01:52:52.900
Thank you.

1457
01:53:02.576 --> 01:53:03.845
He's asking for you.

1458
01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:20.294
Hey, Jake.

1459
01:53:23.931 --> 01:53:25.066
Hey.

1460
01:53:38.079 --> 01:53:40.014
I was worried about you.

1461
01:53:40.047 --> 01:53:41.949
You were worried about me?

1462
01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:46.220
Yeah.

1463
01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:48.923
I guessed Edward
would read my thoughts.

1464
01:53:51.525 --> 01:53:53.494
Was he hard on you?

1465
01:53:53.527 --> 01:53:55.062
He wasn't even mad at me.

1466
01:53:56.230 --> 01:53:57.464
Or you.

1467
01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.467
Well, damn.

1468
01:54:03.104 --> 01:54:04.605
He's better than I thought.

1469
01:54:05.639 --> 01:54:07.841
He's not playing a game.

1470
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:10.945
Right.

1471
01:54:14.215 --> 01:54:15.582
Bella.

1472
01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.923
He's not as perfect
as you think.

1473
01:54:25.392 --> 01:54:26.961
I know who he is.

1474
01:54:31.432 --> 01:54:35.202
Can we just not talk about that?

1475
01:54:35.236 --> 01:54:37.939
I'd rather get all
the re-breaking done
at once.

1476
01:54:44.178 --> 01:54:46.880
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1477
01:54:51.052 --> 01:54:54.055
It wasn't easy
making you admit
your feelings for me.

1478
01:54:58.025 --> 01:55:00.527
I only fought them
because I knew they
wouldn't change anything.

1479
01:55:09.070 --> 01:55:11.672
I'm exactly
right for you, Bella.

1480
01:55:14.308 --> 01:55:19.046
It would be as easy
as breathing, with me.

1481
01:55:24.986 --> 01:55:27.154
You know I love you.

1482
01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:37.031
You know how much
I wish it was enough.

1483
01:55:48.642 --> 01:55:50.077
Should I come back?

1484
01:55:53.214 --> 01:55:54.982
I need some time.

1485
01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:01.588
But I'll always be waiting.

1486
01:56:07.161 --> 01:56:09.630
Until my heart stops beating.

1487
01:56:11.532 --> 01:56:12.733
Maybe even then.

1488
01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:37.791
August 13th?

1489
01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:41.228
Yeah. It's a month
before my birthday.

1490
01:56:41.262 --> 01:56:45.132
I don't need to be
another year older
than you.

1491
01:56:45.166 --> 01:56:46.633
Alice said she
could get the wedding
together by then.

1492
01:56:47.668 --> 01:56:49.436
I'm sure she can.

1493
01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:53.474
There's no rush.

1494
01:56:56.377 --> 01:57:00.514
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.

1495
01:57:00.547 --> 01:57:04.318
And so you're
gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1496
01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:08.689
The, uh, dress,
the reception,
the guest list.

1497
01:57:08.722 --> 01:57:11.392
I mean, who knows
who she's gonna invite?

1498
01:57:13.527 --> 01:57:15.162
Does it matter?

1499
01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.468
I just don't know
why you're doing this.

1500
01:57:21.502 --> 01:57:23.370
What? The wedding?

1501
01:57:24.371 --> 01:57:25.539
No.

1502
01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:31.612
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1503
01:57:31.645 --> 01:57:34.081
but you're already
giving away too much.

1504
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:36.517
You're wrong.

1505
01:57:44.658 --> 01:57:48.095
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1506
01:57:51.865 --> 01:57:55.836
It was between
who I should be
and who I am.

1507
01:57:59.873 --> 01:58:04.545
I've always felt out of step,
like literally
stumbling through my life.

1508
01:58:07.648 --> 01:58:09.616
I've never felt normal.

1509
01:58:12.286 --> 01:58:14.087
Because I'm not normal.

1510
01:58:15.456 --> 01:58:17.191
I don't want to be.

1511
01:58:18.625 --> 01:58:25.399
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1512
01:58:25.432 --> 01:58:28.269
in your world,
but I've also
never felt stronger

1513
01:58:31.272 --> 01:58:34.275
and more real, more myself.

1514
01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:39.180
Because it's my world, too.

1515
01:58:42.549 --> 01:58:44.185
It's where I belong.

1516
01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:53.194
So it's not just about me?

1517
01:58:55.562 --> 01:58:58.465
No. Sorry.

1518
01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:02.936
I've made a mess
trying to figure
all this out,

1519
01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:07.574
but I wanna do it right.

1520
01:59:07.608 --> 01:59:11.678
And I wanna tie myself
to you in every way
humanly possible.

1521
01:59:15.949 --> 01:59:17.584
Starting with a wedding.

1522
01:59:21.788 --> 01:59:24.458
Actually,

1523
01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:28.929
something a little
more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1524
01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.303
We have to tell Charlie.

1525
01:59:40.607 --> 01:59:41.742
It's highly dangerous.

1526
01:59:42.943 --> 01:59:45.178
It's a good thing
you're bulletproof.

1527
01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:48.515
I'm gonna need that ring.
