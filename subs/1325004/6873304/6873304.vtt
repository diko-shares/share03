00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.570
<font color="#787878">Who's there?</font>

2
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570
<font color="#787878">Who's there?</font>

3
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.570
<font color="#787878">What do you want?</font>

4
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.570
<font color="#787878">Some say the world will end in fire.</font>

5
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.570
<font color="#787878">Some say in ice....</font>

6
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:42.890
<font color="#787878">From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire.</font>

7
00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:47.007
<font color="#787878">But if I had to perish twice....</font>

8
00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:51.390
<font color="#787878">I think I know enough of hate,</font>

9
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.487
<font color="#787878">To say that,
for destruction,</font>

10
00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:57.980
<font color="#787878">Ice, is also great.</font>

11
00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:02.076
<font color="#787878">And would suffice.</font>

12
00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:05.993
<font color="#787878">You know,
I've got an english final.</font>

13
00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:08.052
<font color="#787878">I gotta focus.</font>

14
00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.484
<font color="#787878">Marry me.</font>

15
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.241
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

16
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.270
<font color="#787878">Marry me.</font>

17
00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.382
<font color="#787878">Change me.</font>

18
00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:53.128
<font color="#787878">Okey I will if you marry me, it's called a compromise.</font>

19
00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.221
<font color="#787878">It's just called coercion.</font>

20
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.221
<font color="#787878">It's not fair.</font>

21
00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.558
<font color="#787878">Marriage is just....</font>

22
00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:07.995
<font color="#787878">Is a piece of paper.</font>

23
00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:14.153
<font color="#787878">Where I am from,
it's the way one says, 'I love you'.</font>

24
00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:18.094
<font color="#787878">Where I come from,
at my age....</font>

25
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:23.731
<font color="#787878">It's the way one says,
'I just got knocked up'.</font>

26
00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:30.338
<font color="#787878">So, you're worried about
what people will think.</font>

27
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:36.201
<font color="#787878">You know, it's two out of three marriages end in divorce.</font>

28
00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:39.069
<font color="#787878">Well, I think you'll find the....</font>

29
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.238
<font color="#787878">Vampire, human divorce rate is a little lower.</font>

30
00:04:48.373 --> 00:04:50.373
<font color="#787878">Just marry me.</font>

31
00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.349
<font color="#787878">I can't.</font>

32
00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:00.075
<font color="#787878">I have to be back at four.</font>

33
00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:25.820
<font color="#787878">Four o'clock on the dot.</font>

34
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.429
<font color="#787878">That kid trying to brown nose me now or something?</font>

35
00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.609
<font color="#787878">He has a name.
And now he's too punctual for you?</font>

36
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:43.529
<font color="#787878">Okey....</font>

37
00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:47.309
<font color="#787878">You understand
why you're being punished, right?</font>

38
00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.319
<font color="#787878">I know, I put you through hell.
~ Yes, you did.</font>

39
00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.171
<font color="#787878">But I have other reasons, for grounding you.</font>

40
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.307
<font color="#787878">Like....</font>

41
00:06:01.818 --> 00:06:05.885
<font color="#787878">I just want you to get
some separation from him.</font>

42
00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:10.496
<font color="#787878">Dad, there is nothing you can say.</font>

43
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.571
<font color="#787878">Edward is in my life.</font>

44
00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:19.249
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm gathering that.</font>

45
00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.746
<font color="#787878">So, alright. How about this? I'll make you a deal.</font>

46
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.065
<font color="#787878">You're not grounded anymore, if....</font>

47
00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.411
<font color="#787878">You use your new found freedom....</font>

48
00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:35.624
<font color="#787878">....to see some of your other friends too,</font>

49
00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:39.672
<font color="#787878">Like....
Like Jacob.</font>

50
00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:41.244
<font color="#787878">He's going through
a really tough time right now,</font>

51
00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:43.951
<font color="#787878">His Dad's really worried about him.</font>

52
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:46.516
<font color="#787878">I remember when that was you.</font>

53
00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:51.645
<font color="#787878">You needed a friend,
Jake was there.</font>

54
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.053
<font color="#787878">Hey, it's Jake.
Leave a message.</font>

55
00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:03.940
<font color="#787878">Jacob hadn't talk to me in weeks.</font>

56
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.760
<font color="#787878">I wanted to fix it,
he just....</font>

57
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.495
<font color="#787878">He wouldn't give me the chance.</font>

58
00:07:19.222 --> 00:07:23.347
<font color="#787878">'I miss you too.
Doesn't change anything.'</font>

59
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.889
<font color="#787878">You scared me.</font>

60
00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:07.835
<font color="#787878">You're going now to the reservation.</font>

61
00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:11.517
<font color="#787878">How'd you --?
Alice....</font>

62
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:17.407
<font color="#787878">Hey,
did you do this to my truck?</font>

63
00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:21.332
<font color="#787878">Bella, you have to understand. Your safety is everything to me.</font>

64
00:08:21.432 --> 00:08:22.795
<font color="#787878">Jacob is not gonna hurt me.</font>

65
00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:25.710
<font color="#787878">Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control....</font>

66
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.055
<font color="#787878">Edward.
I have....</font>

67
00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:31.623
<font color="#787878">Until graduation,
to see him.</font>

68
00:08:34.383 --> 00:08:38.630
<font color="#787878">And I'll be one of you,
and he'll hate me forever.</font>

69
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.630
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry.</font>

70
00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:57.287
<font color="#787878">Hey.
~ Just in time. Alright, check it out.</font>

71
00:08:57.387 --> 00:08:59.687
<font color="#787878">Alright, let's see what you got.
~ My fellow students.</font>

72
00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:00.519
<font color="#787878">Cool.
~ Right?</font>

73
00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.889
<font color="#787878">Wow.
~ Okey, right? -- Cute.</font>

74
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:04.764
<font color="#787878">We are the future.
Anything is possible....</font>

75
00:09:04.864 --> 00:09:06.448
<font color="#787878">....If you just believe.
~ Nice.</font>

76
00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:08.106
<font color="#787878">Blah, blah, blah....</font>

77
00:09:08.206 --> 00:09:09.986
<font color="#787878">Perfect.
~ And got your self a speech.</font>

78
00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:11.105
<font color="#787878">No, this will be my speech.</font>

79
00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:13.690
<font color="#787878">When I want everyone to throw diplomas at my head.</font>

80
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.790
<font color="#787878">So....
Thank you.</font>

81
00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:18.433
<font color="#787878">Ya gotta embrace the cliches, Jess.</font>

82
00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:20.943
<font color="#787878">They have the bread and butter of all valedictorians.</font>

83
00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:23.494
<font color="#787878">And that is why you are not valedictorian.</font>

84
00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:27.339
<font color="#787878">And Jess doesn't need cliches. Speech is gonna be epic.</font>

85
00:09:27.439 --> 00:09:29.802
<font color="#787878">Epic? It'll change lives.</font>

86
00:09:30.773 --> 00:09:32.438
<font color="#787878">I decided to throw a party.</font>

87
00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.905
<font color="#787878">After all, how many times we gonna graduate high school?</font>

88
00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:38.005
<font color="#787878">A party? At your place?</font>

89
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.357
<font color="#787878">I've never seen your house.
~ No one's ever seen their house.</font>

90
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.325
<font color="#787878">A nother party, Alice?</font>

91
00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:46.099
<font color="#787878">It'll be fun.
~ Yeah.</font>

92
00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:48.834
<font color="#787878">That's what you said last time.</font>

93
00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:53.796
<font color="#787878">Hey, Angela.
~ Yes.</font>

94
00:09:53.896 --> 00:09:56.701
<font color="#787878">Do you need some help with those?</font>

95
00:10:25.368 --> 00:10:27.607
<font color="#787878">I know you know what she saw. Tell me.</font>

96
00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:29.707
<font color="#787878">It was nothing.</font>

97
00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:32.462
<font color="#787878">You looked worried.</font>

98
00:10:33.662 --> 00:10:37.890
<font color="#787878">Just that everyone would notice how strange Alice is.</font>

99
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.093
<font color="#787878">I think that ship sailed long ago.</font>

100
00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:45.002
<font color="#787878">I wonder what's wrong.</font>

101
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:47.954
<font color="#787878">There's someone missing
in Seattle, over a year ago.</font>

102
00:10:48.054 --> 00:10:51.029
<font color="#787878">Charlie is doing what he can, but....</font>

103
00:10:53.635 --> 00:10:56.440
<font color="#787878">Do you know something about this?</font>

104
00:10:58.511 --> 00:11:01.839
<font color="#787878">We've been tracking the situation in Seattle for a while.</font>

105
00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:05.571
<font color="#787878">Unexplained disappearances, killings....</font>

106
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:07.568
<font color="#787878">If the situation gets anymore conspicuous,</font>

107
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:09.793
<font color="#787878">the Volturi will step in.</font>

108
00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:13.940
<font color="#787878">If they go to Seattle,
they can come here.</font>

109
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.313
<font color="#787878">They can see I'm still human.
~ We won't get that far.</font>

110
00:11:17.413 --> 00:11:20.643
<font color="#787878">But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.</font>

111
00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:23.041
<font color="#787878">I'll fax these down the first thing.</font>

112
00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.141
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

113
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.750
<font color="#787878">Hey.
~ Hey.</font>

114
00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:31.449
<font color="#787878">You're ready for dinner?
~ Yeah.</font>

115
00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:34.929
<font color="#787878">It is still just....
you and I, alright?</font>

116
00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:38.071
<font color="#787878">No, I'm just dropping her off.</font>

117
00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.932
<font color="#787878">See you later.
~ Bye.</font>

118
00:11:42.432 --> 00:11:44.521
<font color="#787878">Oh.... Bella.</font>

119
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:46.309
<font color="#787878">My parents wanted to
remind you about the....</font>

120
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:48.333
<font color="#787878">Airline ticket you got for your birthday.</font>

121
00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:50.433
<font color="#787878">What airline ticket?</font>

122
00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:54.328
<font color="#787878">A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.</font>

123
00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:56.733
<font color="#787878">Wow, that was generous.</font>

124
00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.213
<font color="#787878">And it expires soon, they say you might wanna use it this weekend.</font>

125
00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:02.937
<font color="#787878">Well, I can't just drop everything and go.</font>

126
00:12:02.937 --> 00:12:06.199
<font color="#787878">It might be your last chance to see her before you graduate.</font>

127
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.678
<font color="#787878">Well. It might not be a bad idea.</font>

128
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:09.934
<font color="#787878">get out of the town for a couple of days,</font>

129
00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:12.313
<font color="#787878">get some distance.</font>

130
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:16.649
<font color="#787878">Yeah,
I wouldn't mind seeing Mom....</font>

131
00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:18.759
<font color="#787878">As long as you use the companion ticket.</font>

132
00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:21.342
<font color="#787878">Wait, just two tickets?</font>

133
00:12:23.513 --> 00:12:27.458
<font color="#787878">Super,
That makes me really happy.</font>

134
00:12:29.946 --> 00:12:32.362
<font color="#787878">I did wanna see my Mom.</font>

135
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:36.782
<font color="#787878">I wanted to know that her life was full by satisfying</font>

136
00:12:38.232 --> 00:12:40.527
<font color="#787878">Aren't you gonna miss this?</font>

137
00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:45.776
<font color="#787878">Don't you just feel the vitamin D soaking up in your pores?</font>

138
00:12:47.957 --> 00:12:50.167
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.</font>

139
00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:56.127
<font color="#787878">You know, colleges in Florida are a lot sunnier.</font>

140
00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.069
<font color="#787878">I'm just saying,
if you go to university of Alaska....</font>

141
00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:04.209
<font color="#787878">I'm never gonna see you.</font>

142
00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:11.805
<font color="#787878">They have a really great science program.</font>

143
00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:14.154
<font color="#787878">You mean Edward program.</font>

144
00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:18.864
<font color="#787878">The way he watches you....</font>

145
00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.295
<font color="#787878">It's like he's willing to leap in front of you,</font>

146
00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:23.030
<font color="#787878">and take a bullet or something.</font>

147
00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:25.309
<font color="#787878">Is that a bad thing?</font>

148
00:13:25.784 --> 00:13:28.296
<font color="#787878">It's an intense thing.</font>

149
00:13:28.296 --> 00:13:30.506
<font color="#787878">You're different with him.</font>

150
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:34.985
<font color="#787878">If he moves, you move.
Like magnets.</font>

151
00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:38.847
<font color="#787878">I don't know, we're just....</font>

152
00:13:38.847 --> 00:13:41.407
<font color="#787878">In love.
I get it.</font>

153
00:13:42.353 --> 00:13:43.068
<font color="#787878">I just want to make sure,</font>

154
00:13:43.168 --> 00:13:46.568
<font color="#787878">you're making the right choices for you.</font>

155
00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:52.519
<font color="#787878">You know, cause you're the one who's gonna have to live with him.</font>

156
00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:56.249
<font color="#787878">Alright, enough with the heavy.</font>

157
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:06.119
<font color="#787878">Mom.
~ Congraduation.</font>

158
00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:07.564
<font color="#787878">I didn't want you to spending you're money.</font>

159
00:14:07.664 --> 00:14:09.664
<font color="#787878">I didn't, come on.</font>

160
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.130
<font color="#787878">Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
~ Emm. -- Get out.</font>

161
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.413
<font color="#787878">I saved'em all.
I thought they'd make a good quilt.</font>

162
00:14:29.513 --> 00:14:32.063
<font color="#787878">To keep you warm up in Alaska.</font>

163
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:35.680
<font color="#787878">Remember this one?
Ensanada.</font>

164
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.680
<font color="#787878">The snake pit.
~ Yep.</font>

165
00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:41.058
<font color="#787878">But this one is my favourite. Here....</font>

166
00:14:41.158 --> 00:14:43.557
<font color="#787878">The three-headed lobster in Maine.</font>

167
00:14:43.657 --> 00:14:46.223
<font color="#787878">This is amazing.
~ No, honey. I'm glad you've like it.</font>

168
00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:48.330
<font color="#787878">I just figured, you know, when you get older, have kids,</font>

169
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.782
<font color="#787878">We can add to it.
Maybe go visit....</font>

170
00:14:49.882 --> 00:14:52.097
<font color="#787878">....the world's largest catsup bottle or something.</font>

171
00:14:52.197 --> 00:14:54.203
<font color="#787878">Thanks
~ Oh....</font>

172
00:14:56.099 --> 00:14:58.099
<font color="#787878">I'm glad you like it.</font>

173
00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:04.326
<font color="#787878">I just thought, you should have a little piece of me, 
up there in Alaska.</font>

174
00:15:04.426 --> 00:15:06.747
<font color="#787878">Mom.
~ Yeah.</font>

175
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:15.388
<font color="#787878">I miss you.
~ Oh, honey. I miss you too.</font>

176
00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:35.654
<font color="#787878">You sure this is where you saw her?</font>

177
00:15:35.817 --> 00:15:37.817
<font color="#787878">She's almost here.</font>

178
00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.582
<font color="#787878">On your left.</font>

179
00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:30.695
<font color="#787878">Wait.
She's in their territory.</font>

180
00:16:32.212 --> 00:16:34.212
<font color="#787878">She'll get away.</font>

181
00:16:35.136 --> 00:16:37.136
<font color="#787878">No she won't.</font>

182
00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:14.285
<font color="#787878">Emmett, no.</font>

183
00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:48.802
<font color="#787878">Did you regret going?</font>

184
00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.269
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

185
00:17:52.868 --> 00:17:58.300
<font color="#787878">It was really great to see my mom. Just really hard saying goodbye.</font>

186
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.710
<font color="#787878">It doesn't have to be goodbye.
~ Is that why you ask me to go?</font>

187
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.125
<font color="#787878">You thought I was gonna change my mind.</font>

188
00:18:06.322 --> 00:18:08.617
<font color="#787878">I'm always hoping for that.</font>

189
00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:12.209
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

190
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:16.539
<font color="#787878">If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?</font>

191
00:18:22.108 --> 00:18:24.108
<font color="#787878">Of course not.</font>

192
00:18:35.852 --> 00:18:37.852
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

193
00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:43.112
<font color="#787878">Charlie said you left town.
~ Yeah. To visit my Mom, why?</font>

194
00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:46.820
<font color="#787878">Just checking to see if you're still human.</font>

195
00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:49.105
<font color="#787878">I'm coming here to warn you.</font>

196
00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.634
<font color="#787878">If your kind come on our land again....</font>

197
00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.734
<font color="#787878">Wait, what?</font>

198
00:18:55.595 --> 00:18:59.760
<font color="#787878">You didn't tell her?
~ Just leave it alone, Jacob.</font>

199
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
<font color="#787878">Tell me what?</font>

200
00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:05.590
<font color="#787878">Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding,</font>

201
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.327
<font color="#787878">there is nothing to worry about.</font>

202
00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:09.133
<font color="#787878">Listen to you.</font>

203
00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:11.201
<font color="#787878">Did you lie to get her out of town, too?</font>

204
00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:15.245
<font color="#787878">You should leave.
Now.</font>

205
00:19:15.245 --> 00:19:17.329
<font color="#787878">She has a right to know.</font>

206
00:19:18.022 --> 00:19:20.912
<font color="#787878">She is the one the red-head wants.</font>

207
00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:23.856
<font color="#787878">Victoria?</font>

208
00:19:24.558 --> 00:19:29.591
<font color="#787878">Alices's vision.
~ I was trying to protect you.</font>

209
00:19:29.591 --> 00:19:31.770
<font color="#787878">By lying to me.</font>

210
00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:37.060
<font color="#787878">Okey. We're gonna talk about this, but....</font>

211
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.792
<font color="#787878">You.</font>

212
00:19:38.892 --> 00:19:41.527
<font color="#787878">Why haven't you called me back?</font>

213
00:19:43.812 --> 00:19:46.234
<font color="#787878">I had nothing to say.</font>

214
00:19:48.036 --> 00:19:50.841
<font color="#787878">Well, I have tons. Hold on.
~ Hey.</font>

215
00:19:52.546 --> 00:19:54.103
<font color="#787878">Bella.</font>

216
00:19:54.203 --> 00:19:58.113
<font color="#787878">Edward, you have to trust me.
~ I do trust you.</font>

217
00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:00.298
<font color="#787878">It's him I don't trust.</font>

218
00:20:11.255 --> 00:20:14.211
<font color="#787878">Lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.</font>

219
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:16.311
<font color="#787878">Hold on tight.</font>

220
00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:32.560
<font color="#787878">Are you sure,
this is a good idea?</font>

221
00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:36.584
<font color="#787878">I'm a 'vampire girl',
remember?</font>

222
00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:39.705
<font color="#787878">Look who's back.
~ Whatup, Bella?</font>

223
00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.524
<font color="#787878">Quil, you too?
~ Yep. Finally made the pack.</font>

224
00:20:43.524 --> 00:20:44.501
<font color="#787878">I'm glad you're here, Bella.</font>

225
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:47.175
<font color="#787878">Maybe we can get a break from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.</font>

226
00:20:47.275 --> 00:20:48.761
<font color="#787878">'I wish Bella would call'.</font>

227
00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:51.395
<font color="#787878">'I wish Bella wouldn't call'.
~ 'Maybe I should call Bella'.</font>

228
00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:54.532
<font color="#787878">'Maybe I should call Bella and hang up'.</font>

229
00:20:54.632 --> 00:20:57.097
<font color="#787878">Alright, you can shut up now.</font>

230
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.550
<font color="#787878">Bella, this is Leah Clearwater. Harry's daughter.</font>

231
00:21:03.643 --> 00:21:06.797
<font color="#787878">Hey.
I'm really sorry about your father.</font>

232
00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:12.082
<font color="#787878">If you're here to torture Jacob some more, 
feel free to leave.</font>

233
00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:15.245
<font color="#787878">Fun, isn't she?</font>

234
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.512
<font color="#787878">Bella.... Hi.
~ Hey.</font>

235
00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:21.168
<font color="#787878">I was wondering when we'd see your face around here again.</font>

236
00:21:21.268 --> 00:21:23.109
<font color="#787878">Yeah, same here.</font>

237
00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:24.442
<font color="#787878">Sam, we're good?</font>

238
00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:29.812
<font color="#787878">We're good. She won't be getting through our line anytime soon.</font>

239
00:21:39.085 --> 00:21:41.762
<font color="#787878">So, when did Leah joined the pack?</font>

240
00:21:41.862 --> 00:21:46.345
<font color="#787878">Around when her Dad died. Her brother Seth, also phased.</font>

241
00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:50.574
<font color="#787878">He's only fifteen.
One of the youngest we've had.</font>

242
00:21:50.574 --> 00:21:54.808
<font color="#787878">Sam keeps him home studying, but he's chomping at the bit.</font>

243
00:21:54.908 --> 00:21:57.599
<font color="#787878">Wish it was Leah who'd stay home.</font>

244
00:21:57.699 --> 00:21:59.821
<font color="#787878">Come on,
don't be such a guy.</font>

245
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:05.871
<font color="#787878">No, it's... It's not a chick thing. It's.... You know, a triangle thing.</font>

246
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:10.351
<font color="#787878">We all have to live
the Leah, Sam, Emily pain-fest.</font>

247
00:22:11.244 --> 00:22:13.256
<font color="#787878">Wolf telepathy, remember?</font>

248
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:16.117
<font color="#787878">So, Sam dumps Leah for Emily?</font>

249
00:22:16.117 --> 00:22:21.274
<font color="#787878">It wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.</font>

250
00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:23.714
<font color="#787878">But, Emily was The One.</font>

251
00:22:24.553 --> 00:22:28.633
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I guess it's sort of chooses you sometimes.</font>

252
00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:34.205
<font color="#787878">It's more than some crush, Bella. Sam imprinted on Emily.</font>

253
00:22:35.486 --> 00:22:38.121
<font color="#787878">Do I want to know what that is?</font>

254
00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:50.661
<font color="#787878">Imprinting on someone is like....</font>

255
00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:57.150
<font color="#787878">Like when you see her,
everything changes.</font>

256
00:22:58.613 --> 00:23:03.376
<font color="#787878">All of a sudden, it's not gravity holding you to the planet.</font>

257
00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:05.476
<font color="#787878">It's her.</font>

258
00:23:05.656 --> 00:23:11.056
<font color="#787878">Nothing else matters.
You would do anything....</font>

259
00:23:12.332 --> 00:23:15.204
<font color="#787878">Be anything for her.</font>

260
00:23:17.097 --> 00:23:20.157
<font color="#787878">It sounds like you know the feeling.</font>

261
00:23:23.244 --> 00:23:28.344
<font color="#787878">Have you....
imprinted on someone?</font>

262
00:23:33.778 --> 00:23:35.877
<font color="#787878">You'd know if I had.</font>

263
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:43.205
<font color="#787878">I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.</font>

264
00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:48.219
<font color="#787878">So for now, you're....
still you.</font>

265
00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:54.864
<font color="#787878">And you're still you.
~ Yeah.</font>

266
00:24:00.327 --> 00:24:02.407
<font color="#787878">Until graduation.</font>

267
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.442
<font color="#787878">graduation?</font>

268
00:24:06.407 --> 00:24:08.022
<font color="#787878">You knew this was gonna happen.</font>

269
00:24:08.122 --> 00:24:10.122
<font color="#787878">Not in a month.</font>

270
00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:16.057
<font color="#787878">I mean, not before you've.... you've even lived.</font>

271
00:24:17.097 --> 00:24:19.331
<font color="#787878">Or before I could....</font>

272
00:24:22.712 --> 00:24:27.466
<font color="#787878">For a second, just a second, I thought....</font>

273
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.675
<font color="#787878">But he's got his hooks in you so deep.</font>

274
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:37.106
<font color="#787878">I decided this, not him.
~ Bella, they're not even a live.</font>

275
00:24:37.616 --> 00:24:39.616
<font color="#787878">It makes me sick.</font>

276
00:24:41.729 --> 00:24:45.384
<font color="#787878">Better you really be dead than one of them.</font>

277
00:24:57.775 --> 00:25:00.325
<font color="#787878">I can't believe you said that.</font>

278
00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:06.166
<font color="#787878">Edward was right,
I shouldn't have come.</font>

279
00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:09.459
<font color="#787878">Bella, come on.
Please.</font>

280
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:14.521
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry.</font>

281
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.793
<font color="#787878">You know....</font>

282
00:26:24.893 --> 00:26:28.240
<font color="#787878">Edward could at least respect meal times.</font>

283
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.691
<font color="#787878">I was just with Jake.</font>

284
00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:32.691
<font color="#787878">Oh....
Good.</font>

285
00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:42.272
<font color="#787878">I'll just give you two some privacy then.</font>

286
00:26:44.355 --> 00:26:44.937
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

287
00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:46.708
<font color="#787878">Do you understand how worried I've been?</font>

288
00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:48.031
<font color="#787878">I was perfectly safe.</font>

289
00:26:48.131 --> 00:26:51.492
<font color="#787878">I almost break the treaty to make sure of it.</font>

290
00:26:51.592 --> 00:26:57.202
<font color="#787878">I know, I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
~ No, no. Something's wrong.</font>

291
00:27:01.722 --> 00:27:05.632
<font color="#787878">Edward, what's wrong?
~ Someone's been in here.</font>

292
00:27:10.683 --> 00:27:14.027
<font color="#787878">Who was it?
Someone we know?</font>

293
00:27:14.027 --> 00:27:17.052
<font color="#787878">Just a stranger.
I didn't recognize his scent.</font>

294
00:27:17.152 --> 00:27:18.659
<font color="#787878">A nomad passing through?</font>

295
00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:21.351
<font color="#787878">A passer-by wouldn't have left Bella's father alive.</font>

296
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:26.092
<font color="#787878">His scent disappeared about five miles south of Bella's house.</font>

297
00:27:26.192 --> 00:27:29.592
<font color="#787878">Someone's orchestrating this.
~ Victoria?</font>

298
00:27:30.292 --> 00:27:33.830
<font color="#787878">I would've seen her deciding.
~ It has to be the Volturi.</font>

299
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.544
<font color="#787878">I don't think it's the Volturi either.</font>

300
00:27:36.644 --> 00:27:38.209
<font color="#787878">I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.</font>

301
00:27:38.309 --> 00:27:39.539
<font color="#787878">So we keep looking.</font>

302
00:27:39.639 --> 00:27:42.593
<font color="#787878">We also take shifts,
guarding Bella at her house.</font>

303
00:27:42.693 --> 00:27:45.838
<font color="#787878">A nother protection detail?
~ Rosalie.</font>

304
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:48.345
<font color="#787878">No, she's right.</font>

305
00:27:48.445 --> 00:27:51.161
<font color="#787878">You can't protect me,
watch my dad....</font>

306
00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:52.844
<font color="#787878">....and search for the intruder.</font>

307
00:27:52.944 --> 00:27:56.435
<font color="#787878">And for Victoria.
~ And keep yourselves fed.</font>

308
00:27:56.535 --> 00:27:58.177
<font color="#787878">I'm not leaving you here defenseless.</font>

309
00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:01.252
<font color="#787878">Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.</font>

310
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:05.369
<font color="#787878">And I wouldn't be unprotected, I have....</font>

311
00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:07.369
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

312
00:28:14.494 --> 00:28:17.354
<font color="#787878">Whoever it was,
he left his stink behind.</font>

313
00:28:17.454 --> 00:28:20.132
<font color="#787878">It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.</font>

314
00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:24.012
<font color="#787878">We'll handle it from here.
~ We don't need you to handle anything.</font>

315
00:28:24.112 --> 00:28:27.040
<font color="#787878">Or anyone.
~ I could care less what you need.</font>

316
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.923
<font color="#787878">Alright, we're done here.</font>

317
00:28:29.023 --> 00:28:31.907
<font color="#787878">No, you're done here.
~ Stop.</font>

318
00:28:31.907 --> 00:28:36.327
<font color="#787878">I'm tired of this.
From now on I'm Switzerland, Okay?</font>

319
00:28:36.729 --> 00:28:41.659
<font color="#787878">Edward hated the idea,
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.</font>

320
00:28:41.996 --> 00:28:45.141
<font color="#787878">It was about my safety,
and Charlie's.</font>

321
00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:51.709
<font color="#787878">In the days that followed I got them to at least try 
to work together.</font>

322
00:28:55.258 --> 00:28:59.083
<font color="#787878">The wolves took over
so the Cullen's can hunt.</font>

323
00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:03.926
<font color="#787878">It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.</font>

324
00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:22.006
<font color="#787878">Doesn't he own a shirt?</font>

325
00:29:26.543 --> 00:29:28.454
<font color="#787878">I'm good here,
you should go.</font>

326
00:29:28.554 --> 00:29:33.860
<font color="#787878">I'm not gonna be going long.
~ Don't rush. You need to hunt.</font>

327
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:52.489
<font color="#787878">Maybe you rush a little bit.</font>

328
00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.570
<font color="#787878">Hey, beautiful.
~ Hi.</font>

329
00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:14.684
<font color="#787878">So, whaddaya wanna do today? Bike, hike, hang?</font>

330
00:30:14.684 --> 00:30:18.424
<font color="#787878">Your call.
Or we're going to a party tonight.</font>

331
00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:25.413
<font color="#787878">You sure this is okay?
I really hate being a party crasher.</font>

332
00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.866
<font color="#787878">Technically,
you're a Council Meeting crasher.</font>

333
00:30:28.966 --> 00:30:34.491
<font color="#787878">See. The Council leaders, Dad, Quil's grandpa, and Sue Clearwater.</font>

334
00:30:34.698 --> 00:30:36.489
<font color="#787878">She took over for Harry when he died.</font>

335
00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:38.884
<font color="#787878">Okay, I should not be here.</font>

336
00:30:39.205 --> 00:30:42.867
<font color="#787878">You're okay.
I thought....

337
00:30:42.867 --> 00:30:46.500
<font color="#787878">I mean, they thought it would be good for you to hear the histories.</font>

338
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.600
<font color="#787878">The histories? The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?</font>

339
00:30:52.663 --> 00:30:56.850
<font color="#787878">We all got a role to play. And you're a part of this.</font>

340
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.916
<font color="#787878">I mean, it's the first time Seth, Leah and Quil are hearing them, too.</font>

341
00:31:00.016 --> 00:31:03.414
<font color="#787878">But you are the first outsider. Ever.</font>

342
00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:09.333
<font color="#787878">If I haven't known that,
I wouldn't believe you.</font>

343
00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:12.408
<font color="#787878">And would've dressed better.
~ Jake.</font>

344
00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:15.897
<font color="#787878">Hey.
~ It's about time, you got here.</font>

345
00:31:15.997 --> 00:31:19.048
<font color="#787878">Paul's been hoovering the grub. But, I saved you some burgers.</font>

346
00:31:19.148 --> 00:31:21.373
<font color="#787878">Good looking out, Bro.</font>

347
00:31:21.373 --> 00:31:24.271
<font color="#787878">Bella, this is Seth Clearwater, Leah's brother.</font>

348
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:28.373
<font color="#787878">Newest member of the pack.
~ Newest, bestest, brightest.</font>

349
00:31:28.473 --> 00:31:30.473
<font color="#787878">And slowest.</font>

350
00:31:32.783 --> 00:31:36.608
<font color="#787878">Come on. Your dad's about to start.
~ Alright.</font>

351
00:31:37.293 --> 00:31:41.392
<font color="#787878">The Quileutes have been a small tribe from the beginning....</font>

352
00:31:41.492 --> 00:31:44.892
<font color="#787878">But we've always had magic in our blood.</font>

353
00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:48.524
<font color="#787878">We were great spirit warriors....</font>

354
00:31:48.624 --> 00:31:53.724
<font color="#787878">Shape shifters,
that transform into the powerful wolf.</font>

355
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.789
<font color="#787878">This enabled us to scare off our enemies,</font>

356
00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:01.395
<font color="#787878">and protect our tribe.</font>

357
00:32:02.978 --> 00:32:07.978
<font color="#787878">One day our warriors
came across a creature....</font>

358
00:32:09.068 --> 00:32:14.168
<font color="#787878">It looked like a man,
but it was hard like stone,</font>

359
00:32:14.168 --> 00:32:16.524
<font color="#787878">and cold as ice....</font>

360
00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:40.222
<font color="#787878">Our warriors' sharp teeth, finally tore it apart....</font>

361
00:32:40.322 --> 00:32:44.160
<font color="#787878">But only fire would completely destroy it.</font>

362
00:32:44.942 --> 00:32:48.852
<font color="#787878">They lived in fear,
the Cold Man was not alone.</font>

363
00:32:49.955 --> 00:32:51.955
<font color="#787878">And they were right.</font>

364
00:32:55.522 --> 00:32:59.092
<font color="#787878">She took her vengeance out on the village.</font>

365
00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:03.616
<font color="#787878">Our elder chief,
Taha Aki,</font>

366
00:33:03.616 --> 00:33:07.011
<font color="#787878">was the only spirit warrior left to save the tribe,</font>

367
00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:09.893
<font color="#787878">after his son was killed.</font>

368
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:25.630
<font color="#787878">Taha Aki's Third Wife could sees that he would lose....</font>

369
00:33:25.915 --> 00:33:29.841
<font color="#787878">The Third Wife was no magical being,</font>

370
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.640
<font color="#787878">no special powers, but one....</font>

371
00:33:34.176 --> 00:33:36.176
<font color="#787878">Courage.</font>

372
00:33:46.949 --> 00:33:50.156
<font color="#787878">The Third Wife's sacrifice distracted the Cold Woman,</font>

373
00:33:50.256 --> 00:33:53.890
<font color="#787878">long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.</font>

374
00:33:54.396 --> 00:33:56.531
<font color="#787878">She saved the tribe.</font>

375
00:33:57.122 --> 00:34:00.437
<font color="#787878">Over time,
our enemies have disappeared.</font>

376
00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:03.299
<font color="#787878">But one remains....</font>

377
00:34:04.672 --> 00:34:06.817
<font color="#787878">The Cold Ones.</font>

378
00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:11.473
<font color="#787878">Our magic awakens when they near.</font>

379
00:34:11.573 --> 00:34:15.993
<font color="#787878">And we sense it now,
we feel the threat in our blood.</font>

380
00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:19.891
<font color="#787878">Something terrible is coming.</font>

381
00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:26.703
<font color="#787878">And we must all be ready. All of us.</font>

382
00:34:53.703 --> 00:34:55.703
<font color="#787878">What did you do to me?</font>

383
00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:04.015
<font color="#787878">I'm so....
~ Yeah, I know....</font>

384
00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:08.059
<font color="#787878">We'll find you someone to drink.</font>

385
00:35:15.276 --> 00:35:18.555
<font color="#787878">Just try not to get killed, will you?</font>

386
00:35:21.392 --> 00:35:23.514
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna need numbers.</font>

387
00:35:24.911 --> 00:35:26.930
<font color="#787878">Seattle is in a state of terror....</font>

388
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.861
<font color="#787878">Police are baffled by the escalating murders and disappearances.</font>

389
00:35:30.961 --> 00:35:35.207
<font color="#787878">Theories range from a vicious new gang to a wildly active serial killer....</font>

390
00:35:35.307 --> 00:35:37.732
<font color="#787878">Reporting live, Dawn Chubai. CNN.
~ It's getting worse.</font>

391
00:35:37.832 --> 00:35:39.849
<font color="#787878">We're going to have to do something.</font>

392
00:35:39.949 --> 00:35:44.068
<font color="#787878">It takes more than one of our kind to cause the damage they're reporting.</font>

393
00:35:44.168 --> 00:35:48.120
<font color="#787878">Quite a few more.
They're undisciplined, conspicuous....</font>

394
00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.220
<font color="#787878">It's a Newborns.</font>

395
00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:53.020
<font color="#787878">What, like new vampires?</font>

396
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.205
<font color="#787878">In their first few months after the change.</font>

397
00:35:55.305 --> 00:35:57.717
<font color="#787878">That's when we're at our most uncontrollable,</font>

398
00:35:57.817 --> 00:36:01.868
<font color="#787878">vicious, insane with thirst.</font>

399
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:04.584
<font color="#787878">Something to look forward to.</font>

400
00:36:06.078 --> 00:36:09.929
<font color="#787878">No one has trained these newborns, but this isn't random.</font>

401
00:36:10.029 --> 00:36:12.324
<font color="#787878">Someone's creating an army.</font>

402
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:15.557
<font color="#787878">Oh, now we definitely going to Seattle.</font>

403
00:36:15.657 --> 00:36:17.687
<font color="#787878">An Army of vampires?</font>

404
00:36:17.687 --> 00:36:19.261
<font color="#787878">And they've been created to fight someone.</font>

405
00:36:19.361 --> 00:36:21.171
<font color="#787878">We're the only clan even close to Seattle.</font>

406
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:22.375
<font color="#787878">Regardless,
of who are they were may,</font>

407
00:36:22.475 --> 00:36:25.886
<font color="#787878">if we don't put a stop to them, the Volturi will.</font>

408
00:36:25.986 --> 00:36:28.211
<font color="#787878">I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.</font>

409
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:30.351
<font color="#787878">Maybe they're behind it.</font>

410
00:36:30.843 --> 00:36:33.589
<font color="#787878">In Italy,
I read Aro's mind....</font>

411
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:35.206
<font color="#787878">He wants me and Alice to join him....</font>

412
00:36:35.306 --> 00:36:38.513
<font color="#787878">He knows we'd never choose him as long as our family is still alive.</font>

413
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:41.418
<font color="#787878">An army could solve that for him.</font>

414
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.368
<font color="#787878">Hey.
Did you eat dinner yet?</font>

415
00:36:55.275 --> 00:36:57.699
<font color="#787878">Um.... no....
I haven't.</font>

416
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.605
<font color="#787878">This kid Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago.</font>

417
00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:11.501
<font color="#787878">And his poor parents been papering Seattle with these things 
ever since.</font>

418
00:37:11.601 --> 00:37:14.576
<font color="#787878">You think they should just give up?</font>

419
00:37:16.298 --> 00:37:19.270
<font color="#787878">I wouldn't.
If it were you....</font>

420
00:37:21.363 --> 00:37:23.363
<font color="#787878">Not ever.</font>

421
00:37:28.838 --> 00:37:31.795
<font color="#787878">I have to figure out what to tell people....</font>

422
00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:34.955
<font color="#787878">Whu I won't be home for Christmases.</font>

423
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:38.063
<font color="#787878">Why I won't visit.</font>

424
00:37:39.662 --> 00:37:42.297
<font color="#787878">Why they'll never see me again.</font>

425
00:37:42.424 --> 00:37:47.025
<font color="#787878">After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.</font>

426
00:37:49.094 --> 00:37:51.107
<font color="#787878">Problem solved.</font>

427
00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:58.762
<font color="#787878">Why are you so against me becoming like you?</font>

428
00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:00.862
<font color="#787878">I've told you.</font>

429
00:38:03.263 --> 00:38:07.763
<font color="#787878">Be honest with me.
There's more.</font>

430
00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:13.285
<font color="#787878">I know the consequences,
of this choice you're making.</font>

431
00:38:17.993 --> 00:38:23.844
<font color="#787878">I've lived through it,
and to let you suffer that.</font>

432
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.323
<font color="#787878">You believe I have a soul....</font>

433
00:38:28.323 --> 00:38:30.338
<font color="#787878">I don't.</font>

434
00:38:32.506 --> 00:38:37.946
<font color="#787878">But to risk yours, just for the sake of never having to lose you.</font>

435
00:38:39.605 --> 00:38:43.090
<font color="#787878">It's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.</font>

436
00:38:46.373 --> 00:38:51.388
<font color="#787878">I thought, maybe you were afraid that I'll be too different.</font>

437
00:38:52.445 --> 00:38:56.365
<font color="#787878">Unlike. I won't be, you know.... warm.</font>

438
00:38:56.365 --> 00:38:58.490
<font color="#787878">And won't smell the same.</font>

439
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:10.250
<font color="#787878">You'll always be my Bella.</font>

440
00:39:30.769 --> 00:39:33.968
<font color="#787878">My Bella, just less fragile.</font>

441
00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:46.499
<font color="#787878">Gosh, it's so pretty here.</font>

442
00:39:51.966 --> 00:39:55.791
<font color="#787878">So, Alice is planning a big graduation party.</font>

443
00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:58.186
<font color="#787878">Which you're invited to.</font>

444
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:04.845
<font color="#787878">Yeah,
I figured that.</font>

445
00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:14.293
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

446
00:40:15.366 --> 00:40:18.302
<font color="#787878">I just wanted to do this differently.</font>

447
00:40:18.402 --> 00:40:20.402
<font color="#787878">Smoother.</font>

448
00:40:21.312 --> 00:40:23.437
<font color="#787878">But now, I'm out of time.</font>

449
00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:26.631
<font color="#787878">To what?</font>

450
00:40:26.723 --> 00:40:29.528
<font color="#787878">You need to hear the truth, Bella.</font>

451
00:40:29.915 --> 00:40:32.448
<font color="#787878">Understand all your options.</font>

452
00:40:33.902 --> 00:40:35.902
<font color="#787878">You need to know....</font>

453
00:40:37.114 --> 00:40:39.869
<font color="#787878">That I'm in love with you.</font>

454
00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:44.574
<font color="#787878">And I want you to choose me, instead of him.</font>

455
00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:48.067
<font color="#787878">I thought you understood.</font>

456
00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:53.345
<font color="#787878">I don't feel that way for you.
~ I don't buy it.</font>

457
00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:55.445
<font color="#787878">What don't you buy?</font>

458
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.035
<font color="#787878">That's how I feel.</font>

459
00:40:59.035 --> 00:41:03.710
<font color="#787878">You feel something else for me, you just won't admit it.</font>

460
00:41:03.887 --> 00:41:08.987
<font color="#787878">So I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna fight for you.</font>

461
00:41:11.666 --> 00:41:14.301
<font color="#787878">Until your heart stops beating.</font>

462
00:41:14.737 --> 00:41:16.330
<font color="#787878">Well, then you're not gonna have to fight for long.</font>

463
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.727
<font color="#787878">You're rushing into it because you're afraid you'll change your mind.</font>

464
00:41:18.827 --> 00:41:20.827
<font color="#787878">No, I'm not.</font>

465
00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:23.853
<font color="#787878">I know what I want.</font>

466
00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:28.646
<font color="#787878">You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella.</font>

467
00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:31.360
<font color="#787878">Or say goodbye to anybody.</font>

468
00:41:32.093 --> 00:41:35.099
<font color="#787878">I can give you more than him.</font>

469
00:41:35.586 --> 00:41:40.601
<font color="#787878">I mean, he probably can't even kiss you without hurting you.</font>

470
00:41:41.328 --> 00:41:43.718
<font color="#787878">Feel that?</font>

471
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:48.031
<font color="#787878">Flesh and blood and warmth.</font>

472
00:42:12.154 --> 00:42:12.810
<font color="#787878">Edward.</font>

473
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.280
<font color="#787878">If you ever touch her against her will again.</font>

474
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.247
<font color="#787878">Don't do this.
~ She's not sure what she wants.</font>

475
00:42:17.347 --> 00:42:18.726
<font color="#787878">Don't do this.
~ Well, let me give you a clue.</font>

476
00:42:18.826 --> 00:42:22.817
<font color="#787878">Wait for her to say the words.
~ Fine. And she will.</font>

477
00:42:22.917 --> 00:42:25.822
<font color="#787878">Jacob. Just go, okay.
~ Hey, hey, hey, hey....</font>

478
00:42:25.922 --> 00:42:30.439
<font color="#787878">Easy guys, easy.
Let's take it down a notch. Alright?</font>

479
00:42:33.487 --> 00:42:35.487
<font color="#787878">What's going on?</font>

480
00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:40.519
<font color="#787878">I kissed Bella.</font>

481
00:42:44.215 --> 00:42:46.497
<font color="#787878">And she broke her hand....</font>

482
00:42:47.821 --> 00:42:50.024
<font color="#787878">Punching my face.</font>

483
00:42:51.814 --> 00:42:54.206
<font color="#787878">Total misunderstanding.</font>

484
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.950
<font color="#787878">It's just a sprain,
should heal fairly quickly.</font>

485
00:43:01.129 --> 00:43:05.444
<font color="#787878">Trying to walk and chew gum at the same time again, Bella?</font>

486
00:43:05.544 --> 00:43:08.541
<font color="#787878">I punched a werewolf in the face.
~ Bad ass....</font>

487
00:43:08.641 --> 00:43:11.717
<font color="#787878">You're gonna be one tough little newborn.</font>

488
00:43:11.817 --> 00:43:14.281
<font color="#787878">Tough enough to take you on.</font>

489
00:43:19.832 --> 00:43:21.978
<font color="#787878">Don't worry about it.</font>

490
00:43:24.437 --> 00:43:26.561
<font color="#787878">Okay, any Leads?</font>

491
00:43:26.561 --> 00:43:32.256
<font color="#787878">No sign of the intruder. But Victoria continues to make appearances.</font>

492
00:43:38.455 --> 00:43:43.810
<font color="#787878">Go blather to someone else about the joys of becoming a newborn.</font>

493
00:43:45.452 --> 00:43:49.249
<font color="#787878">Okay.
Rosalie....</font>

494
00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:56.397
<font color="#787878">I don't understand what I did, to make you hate me so much.</font>

495
00:43:57.584 --> 00:43:59.584
<font color="#787878">I don't hate you.</font>

496
00:44:01.852 --> 00:44:04.912
<font color="#787878">I don't particularly like you, but....</font>

497
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.745
<font color="#787878">Bella, I envy you.
~ What?</font>

498
00:44:14.977 --> 00:44:17.782
<font color="#787878">That's ridiculous.
~ No, it's not.</font>

499
00:44:19.513 --> 00:44:22.772
<font color="#787878">You have a choice.
I didn't.</font>

500
00:44:23.635 --> 00:44:28.140
<font color="#787878">None of us did. But you do, and you're choosing wrong.</font>

501
00:44:28.344 --> 00:44:32.169
<font color="#787878">I don't care how miserable your human life is.</font>

502
00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:35.368
<font color="#787878">My life is not miserable.</font>

503
00:44:38.027 --> 00:44:41.552
<font color="#787878">It's not perfect,
but nobody's life is perfect.</font>

504
00:44:41.652 --> 00:44:45.952
<font color="#787878">Mine was.
Absolutely perfect.</font>

505
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.956
<font color="#787878">Everything as I still wanted.</font>

506
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:52.596
<font color="#787878">To be married,
with a nice house and a husband....</font>

507
00:44:52.696 --> 00:44:54.678
<font color="#787878">....to kiss me when he came home.</font>

508
00:44:54.778 --> 00:44:56.931
<font color="#787878">A family of my own.</font>

509
00:44:57.615 --> 00:45:01.780
<font color="#787878">Royce King was
the most eligible bachelor in town.</font>

510
00:45:02.209 --> 00:45:04.209
<font color="#787878">I barely knew him.</font>

511
00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:12.800
<font color="#787878">But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.</font>

512
00:45:13.807 --> 00:45:17.271
<font color="#787878">On the last night of my life, I left a friend's house late.</font>

513
00:45:17.371 --> 00:45:20.703
<font color="#787878">I wasn't far from home.
~ Here she is.</font>

514
00:45:20.703 --> 00:45:23.704
<font color="#787878">Hey, Rose.
Come over here.</font>

515
00:45:23.704 --> 00:45:25.704
<font color="#787878">Here, hold this.</font>

516
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.975
<font color="#787878">Hey, come over here.
We've been waiting for you.</font>

517
00:45:31.354 --> 00:45:33.387
<font color="#787878">Here she is</font>

518
00:45:35.258 --> 00:45:37.258
<font color="#787878">Royce.</font>

519
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:39.326
<font color="#787878">You're drunk.</font>

520
00:45:39.426 --> 00:45:42.792
<font color="#787878">Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.</font>

521
00:45:42.892 --> 00:45:45.712
<font color="#787878">It's hard to say with all those clothes on.</font>

522
00:45:45.812 --> 00:45:50.015
<font color="#787878">What do you say, Rose?
Why don't we take off a few layers?</font>

523
00:45:50.115 --> 00:45:52.343
<font color="#787878">Stop it....</font>

524
00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:57.134
<font color="#787878">I'll see you tomorrow.
Sober.</font>

525
00:45:58.807 --> 00:46:00.246
<font color="#787878">Hey, where do you think you're going?</font>

526
00:46:00.346 --> 00:46:06.721
<font color="#787878">Stop it. Just stop it. Let go. Stop it.
~ Comeback. Hey, you'll do as I say.</font>

527
00:46:09.814 --> 00:46:13.109
<font color="#787878">They left me in the street, thinking I was dead.</font>

528
00:46:13.209 --> 00:46:15.504
<font color="#787878">Believe me, I wanted to be.</font>

529
00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:19.210
<font color="#787878">Carlisle found me,
he smelled all the blood....</font>

530
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.540
<font color="#787878">Thought he was helping me.
~ I'm sorry.</font>

531
00:46:24.985 --> 00:46:27.197
<font color="#787878">I got my revenge on them.</font>

532
00:46:28.815 --> 00:46:30.712
<font color="#787878">One at a time.</font>

533
00:46:30.812 --> 00:46:34.977
<font color="#787878">I saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.</font>

534
00:46:52.237 --> 00:46:55.297
<font color="#787878">I was a little theatrical back then.</font>

535
00:47:03.452 --> 00:47:06.767
<font color="#787878">Things got better after I found Emmett.</font>

536
00:47:08.772 --> 00:47:10.897
<font color="#787878">But we'll always be this.</font>

537
00:47:14.726 --> 00:47:19.047
<font color="#787878">Frozen,
never moving forward.</font>

538
00:47:20.459 --> 00:47:24.492
<font color="#787878">That's what I miss the most, the possibilities.</font>

539
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.963
<font color="#787878">Sitting on a front porch somewhere,</font>

540
00:47:28.063 --> 00:47:30.726
<font color="#787878">Emmett gray haired by my side,</font>

541
00:47:30.726 --> 00:47:33.512
<font color="#787878">surrounded by our grandchildren,</font>

542
00:47:34.698 --> 00:47:36.819
<font color="#787878">their laughter.</font>

543
00:47:38.446 --> 00:47:41.414
<font color="#787878">I understand,
that's what you want.</font>

544
00:47:48.224 --> 00:47:52.304
<font color="#787878">But there's nothing
I'll ever gonna want, more....</font>

545
00:47:53.873 --> 00:47:55.873
<font color="#787878">....than Edward.</font>

546
00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:58.165
<font color="#787878">You're wrong again.</font>

547
00:48:00.009 --> 00:48:04.242
<font color="#787878">After you've been changed, there's one thing you'll want more....</font>

548
00:48:04.342 --> 00:48:06.722
<font color="#787878">One thing you'll kill for....</font>

549
00:48:08.597 --> 00:48:10.597
<font color="#787878">Blood.</font>

550
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.234
<font color="#787878">What did I say,
about low profile?</font>

551
00:48:31.577 --> 00:48:33.577
<font color="#787878">Something's coming....</font>

552
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.214
<font color="#787878">Something....
Bigger than any of us alone.</font>

553
00:48:41.032 --> 00:48:43.032
<font color="#787878">And if you can't....</font>

554
00:48:44.146 --> 00:48:46.462
<font color="#787878">....control yourselves....</font>

555
00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:50.325
<font color="#787878">We're all going to die.</font>

556
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.469
<font color="#787878">What's done is done,
just....</font>

557
00:48:59.814 --> 00:49:02.279
<font color="#787878">....clean up after yourselves.</font>

558
00:49:10.759 --> 00:49:13.790
<font color="#787878">They've already drawn too much attention.</font>

559
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.201
<font color="#787878">So has our 'inaction'.</font>

560
00:49:16.201 --> 00:49:20.630
<font color="#787878">Others may begin to question the Volturi's effectiveness.</font>

561
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.730
<font color="#787878">Let them.</font>

562
00:49:27.736 --> 00:49:30.541
<font color="#787878">Maybe we should consult with Aro.</font>

563
00:49:34.953 --> 00:49:37.843
<font color="#787878">Aro's decisions are being watched.</font>

564
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:41.401
<font color="#787878">We must decide.</font>

565
00:49:43.374 --> 00:49:47.320
<font color="#787878">Then decide sister.
It's time.</font>

566
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:50.581
<font color="#787878">Yes, it is.</font>

567
00:49:55.263 --> 00:49:59.002
<font color="#787878">Either we let them do
what they were created for....</font>

568
00:49:59.102 --> 00:50:01.102
<font color="#787878">Or we end them.</font>

569
00:50:01.888 --> 00:50:04.474
<font color="#787878">Decisions, decisions....</font>

570
00:50:14.266 --> 00:50:15.279
<font color="#787878">When we were five,</font>

571
00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:18.612
<font color="#787878">they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up....</font>

572
00:50:18.712 --> 00:50:23.371
<font color="#787878">Our answers were things like astronaut, president....</font>

573
00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:26.172
<font color="#787878">Or in my case, a princess.</font>

574
00:50:26.172 --> 00:50:28.611
<font color="#787878">When we were ten,
they asked again,</font>

575
00:50:28.711 --> 00:50:31.765
<font color="#787878">and we answered,
rock star, cowboy,</font>

576
00:50:31.765 --> 00:50:34.603
<font color="#787878">or in my case,
a gold medalist.</font>

577
00:50:34.603 --> 00:50:38.972
<font color="#787878">But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer.</font>

578
00:50:39.072 --> 00:50:41.862
<font color="#787878">Well, how about this....</font>

579
00:50:41.862 --> 00:50:43.935
<font color="#787878">....who the hell knows?</font>

580
00:50:47.698 --> 00:50:49.799
<font color="#787878">This isn't the time to make hard and fast decisions,</font>

581
00:50:49.899 --> 00:50:52.473
<font color="#787878">this is the time to make mistakes.</font>

582
00:50:52.573 --> 00:50:55.575
<font color="#787878">Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.</font>

583
00:50:55.675 --> 00:50:59.144
<font color="#787878">Fall in love,
a lot.</font>

584
00:50:59.772 --> 00:51:03.885
<font color="#787878">Major in philosophy, because there's no way to make a career out of that.</font>

585
00:51:03.985 --> 00:51:08.575
<font color="#787878">Change your mind, and change it again, because nothing is permanent.</font>

586
00:51:08.675 --> 00:51:11.820
<font color="#787878">So, make as many mistakes as you can.</font>

587
00:51:11.958 --> 00:51:15.028
<font color="#787878">That way, someday,
when they ask what we wanna be....</font>

588
00:51:15.128 --> 00:51:20.105
<font color="#787878">....we won't have to guess. We'll know.</font>

589
00:51:47.447 --> 00:51:49.174
<font color="#787878">You've made it.</font>

590
00:51:49.274 --> 00:51:51.649
<font color="#787878">Hey.
~ What'd you think of my speech?</font>

591
00:51:51.749 --> 00:51:54.657
<font color="#787878">Too easy-breezy, too self-helpful? You may admit it.</font>

592
00:51:54.757 --> 00:51:57.514
<font color="#787878">No, you pretty much nailed it.
~ Yeah?</font>

593
00:51:57.614 --> 00:52:04.074
<font color="#787878">It's like I was born to lead, right?
~ Oh, great. I love this song, let's go.</font>

594
00:52:26.648 --> 00:52:30.983
<font color="#787878">What are you doing here?
~ You invited me, remember?</font>

595
00:52:31.166 --> 00:52:33.644
<font color="#787878">Was my right hook too subtle for you?</font>

596
00:52:33.744 --> 00:52:35.866
<font color="#787878">That was me uninviting you.</font>

597
00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:39.986
<font color="#787878">Look, Bella. I'm sorry.... about, you know....</font>

598
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.370
<font color="#787878">The kiss and your hand....</font>

599
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.772
<font color="#787878">I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing....</font>

600
00:52:45.872 --> 00:52:50.618
<font color="#787878">But it was really just.... me. Being an ass.</font>

601
00:52:51.457 --> 00:52:53.457
<font color="#787878">I'm really sorry.</font>

602
00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:56.607
<font color="#787878">I brought you something.</font>

603
00:52:56.653 --> 00:53:00.315
<font color="#787878">A graduation present.
I made it myself.</font>

604
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:04.108
<font color="#787878">Oh....
You made this?</font>

605
00:53:05.053 --> 00:53:08.230
<font color="#787878">It's really pretty.
Thanks.</font>

606
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:24.881
<font color="#787878">I'll be right back.</font>

607
00:53:27.195 --> 00:53:30.255
<font color="#787878">Alice, what did you see?
~ The decision's been made.</font>

608
00:53:30.355 --> 00:53:33.626
<font color="#787878">What's going on?
~ You're not going to Seattle?</font>

609
00:53:33.726 --> 00:53:35.744
<font color="#787878">No....</font>

610
00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:37.744
<font color="#787878">They're coming here.</font>

611
00:53:38.187 --> 00:53:41.990
<font color="#787878">They'll be here in four days.
~ This could turn into a blood bath.</font>

612
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:46.122
<font color="#787878">Who's behind it?
~ I didn't see anyone I recognize.</font>

613
00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.331
<font color="#787878">Maybe one....</font>

614
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:52.012
<font color="#787878">I know his face.
He's local, Riley Biers.</font>

615
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:53.533
<font color="#787878">He didn't start this.</font>

616
00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:55.981
<font color="#787878">Whoever did is staying out of the action.</font>

617
00:53:56.081 --> 00:53:58.338
<font color="#787878">They must be playing with the blind spots in your vision.</font>

618
00:53:58.438 --> 00:53:59.948
<font color="#787878">Either way,
the army is coming....</font>

619
00:54:00.048 --> 00:54:02.245
<font color="#787878">....and there aren't enough of us to protect the town.</font>

620
00:54:02.345 --> 00:54:05.061
<font color="#787878">Hold up.
What damn army?</font>

621
00:54:05.061 --> 00:54:08.627
<font color="#787878">Newborns. Our kind.
~ What are they after?</font>

622
00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:12.065
<font color="#787878">They were passing around
Bella's scent. A red blouse.</font>

623
00:54:12.165 --> 00:54:14.291
<font color="#787878">They're after Bella?</font>

624
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:17.311
<font color="#787878">What the hell does this mean?
~ It means an ugly fight.</font>

625
00:54:17.411 --> 00:54:19.633
<font color="#787878">With lives lost.</font>

626
00:54:23.833 --> 00:54:25.437
<font color="#787878">Alright....</font>

627
00:54:25.537 --> 00:54:28.041
<font color="#787878">We're in.
~ No.</font>

628
00:54:28.041 --> 00:54:30.034
<font color="#787878">You'll get yourselves killed, noway.</font>

629
00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:34.654
<font color="#787878">I wasn't asking for permission.
~ Edward.</font>

630
00:54:38.003 --> 00:54:40.808
<font color="#787878">It means more protection for you.</font>

631
00:54:40.904 --> 00:54:46.004
<font color="#787878">Jacob. Do you believe Sam will agree to.... an understanding?</font>

632
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.980
<font color="#787878">As long as we get to kill some vampires.</font>

633
00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:54.475
<font color="#787878">Jasper?
~ They'll give us the numbers.</font>

634
00:54:54.475 --> 00:54:57.018
<font color="#787878">And the newborns won't know they even exist.</font>

635
00:54:57.118 --> 00:54:59.734
<font color="#787878">That'll give us an edge.
~ We'll need to coordinate.</font>

636
00:54:59.834 --> 00:55:03.804
<font color="#787878">Carlisle, they'll gonna get hurt.
~ We'll all need some training.</font>

637
00:55:03.904 --> 00:55:06.831
<font color="#787878">Fighting newborns requires knowledge that Jasper has.</font>

638
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:09.141
<font color="#787878">You're welcome to join us.</font>

639
00:55:10.328 --> 00:55:13.557
<font color="#787878">Alright.
Name the time and place.</font>

640
00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:15.079
<font color="#787878">Jake....</font>

641
00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:18.778
<font color="#787878">You don't know
what you're getting yourself in to.</font>

642
00:55:18.878 --> 00:55:20.755
<font color="#787878">Bella....</font>

643
00:55:20.855 --> 00:55:25.126
<font color="#787878">This is what we do.
You should be happy.</font>

644
00:55:25.126 --> 00:55:28.195
<font color="#787878">Look at us, working together.</font>

645
00:55:28.195 --> 00:55:32.530
<font color="#787878">You're the one who wanted us to get along, remember?</font>

646
00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:43.379
<font color="#787878">Again.</font>

647
00:55:55.699 --> 00:55:57.909
<font color="#787878">It's a graduation present.</font>

648
00:56:17.027 --> 00:56:19.704
<font color="#787878">They don't trust us enough to be in their human forms.</font>

649
00:56:19.804 --> 00:56:22.354
<font color="#787878">They came.
That's what matters.</font>

650
00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:25.258
<font color="#787878">Will you translate?</font>

651
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.190
<font color="#787878">Hey, Jake.</font>

652
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.510
<font color="#787878">Welcome.</font>

653
00:56:41.108 --> 00:56:43.560
<font color="#787878">Jasper has experience with newborns.</font>

654
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.550
<font color="#787878">He'll teach us how to defeat them.</font>

655
00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:51.372
<font color="#787878">They want to know
how the 'newborns' is differ from us.</font>

656
00:56:51.472 --> 00:56:52.998
<font color="#787878">They're a great deal stronger than us,</font>

657
00:56:53.098 --> 00:56:56.655
<font color="#787878">because their own human blood lingers in their tissues.</font>

658
00:56:56.755 --> 00:57:00.516
<font color="#787878">Our kind is never more
physically powerful....</font>

659
00:57:00.516 --> 00:57:04.681
<font color="#787878">....than in our first
several months of this life.</font>

660
00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:08.381
<font color="#787878">Carlisle's right.</font>

661
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:10.761
<font color="#787878">That's why they are created.</font>

662
00:57:11.324 --> 00:57:15.844
<font color="#787878">A newborn army, doesn't need thousands like a human army.</font>

663
00:57:15.944 --> 00:57:19.514
<font color="#787878">And no human army
could stand against them.</font>

664
00:57:20.191 --> 00:57:23.170
<font color="#787878">The two most important things to remember are, first....</font>

665
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:24.833
<font color="#787878">Never let them get their arms around you.</font>

666
00:57:24.933 --> 00:57:28.418
<font color="#787878">They'll crush you instantly. The second....</font>

667
00:57:29.642 --> 00:57:32.458
<font color="#787878">Never go for the obvious kill.</font>

668
00:57:33.924 --> 00:57:39.024
<font color="#787878">They'll be expecting that. And you will lose.</font>

669
00:57:40.564 --> 00:57:42.564
<font color="#787878">Emmett?</font>

670
00:57:48.981 --> 00:57:52.359
<font color="#787878">Don't hold back.
Not in my nature.</font>

671
00:58:06.651 --> 00:58:08.651
<font color="#787878">Never lose focus.</font>

672
00:58:29.317 --> 00:58:31.317
<font color="#787878">One more thing....</font>

673
00:58:31.529 --> 00:58:34.504
<font color="#787878">Never turn your back on your enemy.</font>

674
00:59:21.269 --> 00:59:23.904
<font color="#787878">Some of you,
are gonna get hurt.</font>

675
00:59:26.369 --> 00:59:30.169
<font color="#787878">Some of you
could get killed, because of me.</font>

676
00:59:32.807 --> 00:59:37.227
<font color="#787878">It's gonna be a hundred times worse than this, right?</font>

677
00:59:58.358 --> 01:00:00.394
<font color="#787878">We're done for the day.</font>

678
01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:14.983
<font color="#787878">Jasper....</font>

679
01:00:17.475 --> 01:00:20.308
<font color="#787878">Are you sure, there's nothing I can do to help?</font>

680
01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:23.935
<font color="#787878">Your presence alone,
your scent will distract the newborns.</font>

681
01:00:24.035 --> 01:00:28.710
<font color="#787878">Their hunting instinct will take over, drive them crazy.</font>

682
01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.697
<font color="#787878">Good. I'm glad.</font>

683
01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:35.274
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

684
01:00:35.374 --> 01:00:38.349
<font color="#787878">How do you know so much about this?</font>

685
01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:44.320
<font color="#787878">I didn't have quite the same upbringing as my adopted siblings.</font>

686
01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.650
<font color="#787878">Those bites are like mine.</font>

687
01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:53.911
<font color="#787878">Battle scars.</font>

688
01:00:55.013 --> 01:00:57.645
<font color="#787878">All the training the Confederate Army gave me....</font>

689
01:00:57.745 --> 01:01:00.805
<font color="#787878">....was useless against the newborns.</font>

690
01:01:01.102 --> 01:01:05.049
<font color="#787878">Still,
I never lost a fight.</font>

691
01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:12.750
<font color="#787878">This has happened during the civil war?</font>

692
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:15.601
<font color="#787878">I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry.</font>

693
01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:18.446
<font color="#787878">All without having seen any real battle.</font>

694
01:01:18.546 --> 01:01:20.546
<font color="#787878">Until....</font>

695
01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:24.359
<font color="#787878">Until I'm not a certain immortal.</font>

696
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.530
<font color="#787878">Maria.</font>

697
01:01:30.762 --> 01:01:31.872
<font color="#787878">I was riding back to Galveston....</font>

698
01:01:31.972 --> 01:01:35.390
<font color="#787878">....after evacuating
a column of women and children.</font>

699
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.490
<font color="#787878">When I saw her....</font>

700
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:40.834
<font color="#787878">I immediately offered her my aid.</font>

701
01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:51.629
<font color="#787878">Lovely. And an officer.</font>

702
01:01:58.593 --> 01:02:03.793
<font color="#787878">You'd better do it, Maria. I can never stop once I've started.</font>

703
01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:11.275
<font color="#787878">What's your name, soldier?
~ Major Jasper Whitlock, Ma'am.</font>

704
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.375
<font color="#787878">I hope you survive.</font>

705
01:02:14.244 --> 01:02:17.603
<font color="#787878">You maybe of a great use to me.</font>

706
01:02:22.467 --> 01:02:24.395
<font color="#787878">Maria was creating an army?</font>

707
01:02:24.495 --> 01:02:26.534
<font color="#787878">They were very common in the South.</font>

708
01:02:26.634 --> 01:02:30.342
<font color="#787878">And cost a brutal battles for territory.</font>

709
01:02:30.342 --> 01:02:32.376
<font color="#787878">Maria won them all.</font>

710
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:38.230
<font color="#787878">She was smart, careful.
And she had me.</font>

711
01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:43.522
<font color="#787878">I was the second in command.</font>

712
01:02:43.522 --> 01:02:47.602
<font color="#787878">My abilities to control emotions served her well.</font>

713
01:02:48.267 --> 01:02:50.275
<font color="#787878">I trained her newborns.</font>

714
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:59.706
<font color="#787878">An endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year.</font>

715
01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:03.549
<font color="#787878">It was my job to dispose of them.</font>

716
01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.630
<font color="#787878">I could feel everything they felt.</font>

717
01:03:39.201 --> 01:03:42.601
<font color="#787878">I thought what Maria and I had was love.</font>

718
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:48.011
<font color="#787878">But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.</font>

719
01:03:49.178 --> 01:03:52.408
<font color="#787878">I didn't know there was another way....</font>

720
01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:55.560
<font color="#787878">Until I found Alice.</font>

721
01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.070
<font color="#787878">Now she'd seen me coming, of course.</font>

722
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.454
<font color="#787878">Kept me waiting long enough.</font>

723
01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:08.012
<font color="#787878">My apologies, Ma'am.</font>

724
01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:13.466
<font color="#787878">I don't know what I'd have become without her.</font>

725
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.475
<font color="#787878">You'll never have to be that again.</font>

726
01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:07.997
<font color="#787878">What is it?</font>

727
01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:13.854
<font color="#787878">The intruder....</font>

728
01:05:13.854 --> 01:05:16.149
<font color="#787878">The newborn army.</font>

729
01:05:17.772 --> 01:05:20.253
<font color="#787878">They're all her puppets.</font>

730
01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:24.204
<font color="#787878">Victoria.</font>

731
01:05:24.755 --> 01:05:27.941
<font color="#787878">Alice would've seen
if she wanted to make an army.</font>

732
01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:31.217
<font color="#787878">Unless she's hiding behind them,</font>

733
01:05:31.217 --> 01:05:34.447
<font color="#787878">and she's letting someone else decide.</font>

734
01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:04.310
<font color="#787878">Welcome to the army.</font>

735
01:06:13.486 --> 01:06:14.243
<font color="#787878">I'm not just gonna hide,</font>

736
01:06:14.343 --> 01:06:17.828
<font color="#787878">while you're taking all the risks for me?</font>

737
01:06:17.998 --> 01:06:18.759
<font color="#787878">If it's Victoria involved....</font>

738
01:06:18.859 --> 01:06:21.308
<font color="#787878">I need to keep you as far away from the fight as possible.</font>

739
01:06:21.408 --> 01:06:23.608
<font color="#787878">Jasper said that I could be of help.</font>

740
01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:24.967
<font color="#787878">We won't need your help.</font>

741
01:06:25.067 --> 01:06:27.759
<font color="#787878">With the wolves in this,
it's an easy win.</font>

742
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.548
<font color="#787878">The rest of us,
aren't gonna have enough to do.</font>

743
01:06:30.648 --> 01:06:32.775
<font color="#787878">Okay, either it's so dangerous that I have to hide....</font>

744
01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.904
<font color="#787878">Or it's so easy, that you're gonna be side blind, which is it?</font>

745
01:06:35.004 --> 01:06:38.404
<font color="#787878">It's dangerous for you.
It's easy for us.</font>

746
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.519
<font color="#787878">I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.</font>

747
01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:45.187
<font color="#787878">How many times we have to prove that?</font>

748
01:06:45.287 --> 01:06:48.737
<font color="#787878">I'll be worrying.
You'll be worried.</font>

749
01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:51.627
<font color="#787878">And we'll both feel more horrible.</font>

750
01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:54.790
<font color="#787878">Okay, you're right.</font>

751
01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.551
<font color="#787878">So, I'm coming with you.</font>

752
01:06:56.651 --> 01:06:59.268
<font color="#787878">No, we've got to stay away together.</font>

753
01:06:59.368 --> 01:07:02.175
<font color="#787878">I can't make you choose
between me and your family, it's....</font>

754
01:07:02.275 --> 01:07:06.440
<font color="#787878">The only way I can protect you, is to be with you.</font>

755
01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:11.206
<font color="#787878">You're not fighting?</font>

756
01:07:11.306 --> 01:07:13.361
<font color="#787878">What, you pull a muscle or something?</font>

757
01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:16.691
<font color="#787878">He's doing it for me. Okay?
~ Whatever.</font>

758
01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:19.241
<font color="#787878">Just tell me the plan.</font>

759
01:07:19.379 --> 01:07:21.554
<font color="#787878">This field will give us
an advantage in battle.</font>

760
01:07:21.654 --> 01:07:24.944
<font color="#787878">We need to lure the newborns with Bella's scent.</font>

761
01:07:25.044 --> 01:07:26.647
<font color="#787878">It needs to end here.</font>

762
01:07:26.747 --> 01:07:28.313
<font color="#787878">Edward and I are going on a campsite.</font>

763
01:07:28.413 --> 01:07:31.695
<font color="#787878">Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up our scents.</font>

764
01:07:31.795 --> 01:07:33.817
<font color="#787878">Your stench, however,
is revolting.</font>

765
01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.991
<font color="#787878">Dude, you really don't want to start comparing stinks.</font>

766
01:07:36.091 --> 01:07:40.542
<font color="#787878">What he means, is that your scent will mask mine if you carry me.</font>

767
01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.016
<font color="#787878">Done.</font>

768
01:07:42.116 --> 01:07:43.579
<font color="#787878">This is not a good idea.</font>

769
01:07:43.679 --> 01:07:44.757
<font color="#787878">Edward.</font>

770
01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:49.063
<font color="#787878">They won't want to get
anywhere near his.... odor.</font>

771
01:07:49.063 --> 01:07:51.103
<font color="#787878">Okay, let's just try it.</font>

772
01:07:53.827 --> 01:07:56.697
<font color="#787878">Eau de wolf, comin' up.
~ Run.</font>

773
01:08:06.379 --> 01:08:09.151
<font color="#787878">You gonna ask me to sit out the fight, too?</font>

774
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.588
<font color="#787878">Or don't you care about my safety?</font>

775
01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:15.029
<font color="#787878">Of course I care,
but you'd say no.</font>

776
01:08:15.622 --> 01:08:18.220
<font color="#787878">So I won't have a choice anyways.</font>

777
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.031
<font color="#787878">Since I let Sam be alpha male.</font>

778
01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:23.738
<font color="#787878">I got to live with the shots he calls.</font>

779
01:08:23.838 --> 01:08:26.133
<font color="#787878">Since you let Sam be alpha?</font>

780
01:08:27.054 --> 01:08:32.239
<font color="#787878">I didn't want to be in a pack, let alone be it's their leader.</font>

781
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:34.810
<font color="#787878">Wow.</font>

782
01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:39.324
<font color="#787878">Chief Jacob.
~ Opted out.</font>

783
01:08:39.324 --> 01:08:42.183
<font color="#787878">But every choice has it's consequences.</font>

784
01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:45.207
<font color="#787878">Some more than others.
~ Don't start.</font>

785
01:08:45.307 --> 01:08:48.142
<font color="#787878">Everybody makes choices,
you gonna have to accept mine.</font>

786
01:08:48.242 --> 01:08:51.687
<font color="#787878">You can love more than
one person at a time.</font>

787
01:08:51.787 --> 01:08:55.544
<font color="#787878">I've seen it,
with Sam, Emily, and Leah.</font>

788
01:08:56.943 --> 01:08:57.927
<font color="#787878">Well....</font>

789
01:08:58.027 --> 01:09:02.887
<font color="#787878">I'm not a wolf, I can't imprint.
~ It has nothing to do with imprinting.</font>

790
01:09:02.987 --> 01:09:07.203
<font color="#787878">It has to do with....
Feeling something for somebody.</font>

791
01:09:07.303 --> 01:09:10.448
<font color="#787878">And I know you feel something for me.</font>

792
01:09:11.153 --> 01:09:13.318
<font color="#787878">I can sense how I make you feel....</font>

793
01:09:13.418 --> 01:09:15.418
<font color="#787878">Physically.</font>

794
01:09:16.182 --> 01:09:18.182
<font color="#787878">I make you nervous.</font>

795
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:24.341
<font color="#787878">Jake.</font>

796
01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:27.584
<font color="#787878">Don't worry.</font>

797
01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.794
<font color="#787878">I promised I wouldn't kiss you again until you asked.</font>

798
01:09:31.894 --> 01:09:36.824
<font color="#787878">You're going to be keeping that promise for a while, Chief.</font>

799
01:09:38.563 --> 01:09:42.649
<font color="#787878">All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.</font>

800
01:09:45.284 --> 01:09:48.552
<font color="#787878">This will work.
~ Great.</font>

801
01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:01.635
<font color="#787878">Okay, Alice. Don't be a stranger.
~ Okay.</font>

802
01:10:02.822 --> 01:10:04.862
<font color="#787878">Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.</font>

803
01:10:04.962 --> 01:10:06.156
<font color="#787878">Really?</font>

804
01:10:06.256 --> 01:10:08.851
<font color="#787878">I told your father that our whole family's going camping this weekend.</font>

805
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:12.613
<font color="#787878">So you and I are having
a sleep over at my house.</font>

806
01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:16.154
<font color="#787878">Charlie is going fishing anyway.
~ Charlie?</font>

807
01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:18.321
<font color="#787878">You guys run for the same basis now?</font>

808
01:10:18.421 --> 01:10:20.421
<font color="#787878">Me, he likes.</font>

809
01:10:21.247 --> 01:10:26.687
<font color="#787878">Actually, you and Edward will have the house to yourself tonight.</font>

810
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.700
<font color="#787878">Like alone?</font>

811
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:34.135
<font color="#787878">We're all going hunting,
powering up for the battle.</font>

812
01:10:35.956 --> 01:10:37.956
<font color="#787878">You're welcome.</font>

813
01:10:39.309 --> 01:10:43.583
<font color="#787878">Hey. Do you want a sandwich?
~ No, I'm good.</font>

814
01:10:45.092 --> 01:10:48.181
<font color="#787878">Well, the sister....
I like.</font>

815
01:10:48.181 --> 01:10:51.729
<font color="#787878">Alice.
Yeah, she's great.</font>

816
01:10:58.979 --> 01:11:01.383
<font color="#787878">Hey, Dad.
I was wondering....</font>

817
01:11:02.516 --> 01:11:06.031
<font color="#787878">Why didn't you get remarried, after Mom?</font>

818
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.100
<font color="#787878">I don't know....</font>

819
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.340
<font color="#787878">Guess I still haven't met the right gal.</font>

820
01:11:17.297 --> 01:11:19.919
<font color="#787878">Why?
~ I don't know.</font>

821
01:11:22.733 --> 01:11:24.324
<font color="#787878">I thought you just....</font>

822
01:11:24.424 --> 01:11:27.711
<font color="#787878">Maybe you gave up
on the whole institution of it.</font>

823
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:29.811
<font color="#787878">Of marriage.</font>

824
01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:34.370
<font color="#787878">But do you think there's any value in it?</font>

825
01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:36.802
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

826
01:11:36.902 --> 01:11:39.027
<font color="#787878">Yeah, marriage has value.</font>

827
01:11:40.097 --> 01:11:44.297
<font color="#787878">When you're older.
Much older.</font>

828
01:11:46.262 --> 01:11:48.014
<font color="#787878">Like you're mother....</font>

829
01:11:48.114 --> 01:11:50.405
<font color="#787878">It seem to work out fine for her the second time round.</font>

830
01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:53.867
<font color="#787878">Later in life.
~ Yeah, I guess.</font>

831
01:11:55.934 --> 01:11:57.099
<font color="#787878">I mean....</font>

832
01:11:57.199 --> 01:11:58.875
<font color="#787878">You definitely don't wanna have to get married,</font>

833
01:11:58.975 --> 01:12:02.547
<font color="#787878">because you weren't....
careful.</font>

834
01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:06.566
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

835
01:12:06.666 --> 01:12:07.779
<font color="#787878">Look, you know what I'm talking about.</font>

836
01:12:07.879 --> 01:12:09.537
<font color="#787878">There's....</font>

837
01:12:09.637 --> 01:12:11.174
<font color="#787878">Things, that you need
to think about it, if you....</font>

838
01:12:11.274 --> 01:12:12.786
<font color="#787878">If you gonna be....
physically intimate.</font>

839
01:12:12.886 --> 01:12:15.339
<font color="#787878">Okay. Don't....
until we've enough of 'The Talk'.</font>

840
01:12:15.439 --> 01:12:17.299
<font color="#787878">Don't you just quit.
~ It's just as embarrassing for me,</font>

841
01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.482
<font color="#787878">as it is for you.
~ I doubt that.</font>

842
01:12:19.582 --> 01:12:21.997
<font color="#787878">And don't bother, 'cause Mom beat you too early ten years ago.</font>

843
01:12:22.097 --> 01:12:23.957
<font color="#787878">Well, you didn't have a boyfriend ten years ago.</font>

844
01:12:24.057 --> 01:12:27.191
<font color="#787878">I'm sure things work the same way.</font>

845
01:12:28.992 --> 01:12:31.128
<font color="#787878">Alright.
So....</font>

846
01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:34.811
<font color="#787878">You guys are....
taking precautions, and....</font>

847
01:12:34.911 --> 01:12:38.736
<font color="#787878">Okay, dad. Please just
don't worry about that.</font>

848
01:12:39.008 --> 01:12:42.667
<font color="#787878">Edward is.... old school.</font>

849
01:12:44.434 --> 01:12:46.537
<font color="#787878">Old school, great.</font>

850
01:12:46.537 --> 01:12:47.922
<font color="#787878">What's that?
Like a code for something?</font>

851
01:12:48.022 --> 01:12:49.795
<font color="#787878">Oh my god.
Dad....</font>

852
01:12:49.895 --> 01:12:51.581
<font color="#787878">I'm a virgin.</font>

853
01:12:51.681 --> 01:12:54.373
<font color="#787878">Okay, go.
Glad we covered that.</font>

854
01:12:54.373 --> 01:12:56.373
<font color="#787878">Me too.</font>

855
01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:01.731
<font color="#787878">Virgin....</font>

856
01:13:02.723 --> 01:13:05.783
<font color="#787878">Liking Edward a little bit more now.</font>

857
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:19.315
<font color="#787878">What are you doing here outside? What's wrong?</font>

858
01:13:19.415 --> 01:13:21.415
<font color="#787878">Nothing.</font>

859
01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:45.150
<font color="#787878">It seems the only fair,
that I'd be represented as well.</font>

860
01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.923
<font color="#787878">It's really pretty.</font>

861
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:53.050
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

862
01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:02.305
<font color="#787878">There's a bed.</font>

863
01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:06.684
<font color="#787878">I thought you might need one to sleep in.</font>

864
01:14:08.223 --> 01:14:10.766
<font color="#787878">I think an air mattress would've sufficed.</font>

865
01:14:10.866 --> 01:14:14.164
<font color="#787878">It is too much?
~ No.</font>

866
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.992
<font color="#787878">No, it's perfect.</font>

867
01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.601
<font color="#787878">I want to ask you something.</font>

868
01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:23.021
<font color="#787878">Anything.</font>

869
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.023
<font color="#787878">Okay, marriage is the condition for you,</font>

870
01:14:28.123 --> 01:14:30.588
<font color="#787878">to change me yourself, right?</font>

871
01:14:32.113 --> 01:14:34.113
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

872
01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:39.794
<font color="#787878">Okay. I want to negotiate my own condition.</font>

873
01:14:41.358 --> 01:14:44.069
<font color="#787878">Anything you want,
It's yours.</font>

874
01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.565
<font color="#787878">Do you promise?</font>

875
01:14:48.716 --> 01:14:50.716
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

876
01:15:11.563 --> 01:15:13.563
<font color="#787878">Bella.... no.</font>

877
01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:17.671
<font color="#787878">You've said that you wanted me to have every human experience.</font>

878
01:15:17.771 --> 01:15:20.029
<font color="#787878">Not the ones that support risk killing you.</font>

879
01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:22.129
<font color="#787878">You won't.</font>

880
01:15:23.077 --> 01:15:24.319
<font color="#787878">And everyone says,
once I'm changed....</font>

881
01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:27.243
<font color="#787878">....all I'm gonna want is to slaughter the whole town.</font>

882
01:15:27.343 --> 01:15:29.847
<font color="#787878">That part doesn't last forever.</font>

883
01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.947
<font color="#787878">I want you.</font>

884
01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.920
<font color="#787878">While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.</font>

885
01:15:41.902 --> 01:15:43.902
<font color="#787878">It's too dangerous.</font>

886
01:15:44.446 --> 01:15:48.201
<font color="#787878">Try....
Just try.</font>

887
01:15:49.814 --> 01:15:51.542
<font color="#787878">I'll go to some ridiculously expensive college....</font>

888
01:15:51.642 --> 01:15:54.022
<font color="#787878">....and let you buy me a car.</font>

889
01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:56.939
<font color="#787878">I'll marry you, just try.</font>

890
01:16:37.721 --> 01:16:40.266
<font color="#787878">Stop trying to take your clothes off.</font>

891
01:16:40.366 --> 01:16:43.936
<font color="#787878">Do you want to do that part?
~ Not tonight.</font>

892
01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.139
<font color="#787878">Okay.
I mean, you don't....</font>

893
01:17:12.104 --> 01:17:14.104
<font color="#787878">But, fine.</font>

894
01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:19.457
<font color="#787878">Believe me, I want to.</font>

895
01:17:21.175 --> 01:17:24.490
<font color="#787878">I just want to be married to you first.</font>

896
01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:29.614
<font color="#787878">You really make me feel like I'm some sort of like a villain trying....</font>

897
01:17:29.714 --> 01:17:32.604
<font color="#787878">....steal your virtue or something.</font>

898
01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:37.357
<font color="#787878">It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.</font>

899
01:17:38.573 --> 01:17:40.704
<font color="#787878">Are you kidding?</font>

900
01:17:40.704 --> 01:17:45.404
<font color="#787878">It's just one rule,
I wanna leave unbroken.</font>

901
01:17:47.132 --> 01:17:51.941
<font color="#787878">It might be too late for my soul, but I will protect yours.</font>

902
01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:56.720
<font color="#787878">I know it's not a modern notion.
~ It's not modern.</font>

903
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.816
<font color="#787878">It's ancient.</font>

904
01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:03.055
<font color="#787878">I'm from a different era.</font>

905
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:09.752
<font color="#787878">Things were....
a lot less complicated.</font>

906
01:18:11.305 --> 01:18:16.305
<font color="#787878">And if I met you back then, I would've courted to you.</font>

907
01:18:17.981 --> 01:18:20.166
<font color="#787878">We'd have taken chaperoned strolls,</font>

908
01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:23.624
<font color="#787878">or had iced tea on the porch.</font>

909
01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:36.777
<font color="#787878">I may have stolen a kiss or two.</font>

910
01:18:37.293 --> 01:18:40.488
<font color="#787878">But, only....</font>

911
01:18:40.488 --> 01:18:43.973
<font color="#787878">....after asking your father's permission.</font>

912
01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.420
<font color="#787878">I would've got down on one knee.</font>

913
01:18:53.239 --> 01:18:56.469
<font color="#787878">And I would presented you with a ring.</font>

914
01:19:03.262 --> 01:19:05.262
<font color="#787878">This was my mother's.</font>

915
01:19:08.616 --> 01:19:13.546
<font color="#787878">Isabella Swan. I promise
to love you, every moment forever.</font>

916
01:19:14.632 --> 01:19:19.562
<font color="#787878">And would you do me the extraordinary honor of marrying me?</font>

917
01:19:24.276 --> 01:19:26.276
<font color="#787878">Yes.</font>

918
01:19:47.487 --> 01:19:49.697
<font color="#787878">You're not coming with us?</font>

919
01:19:57.994 --> 01:20:00.884
<font color="#787878">It will be a last minute decision.</font>

920
01:20:02.454 --> 01:20:04.934
<font color="#787878">I told you how it works.</font>

921
01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:08.520
<font color="#787878">The Cullens have powers.</font>

922
01:20:09.115 --> 01:20:12.177
<font color="#787878">Don't underestimate them, Riley.</font>

923
01:20:12.177 --> 01:20:14.551
<font color="#787878">You'll have the numbers,</font>

924
01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:16.762
<font color="#787878">but they'll be able to....</font>

925
01:20:16.762 --> 01:20:20.668
<font color="#787878">....anticipate your every move.</font>

926
01:20:21.264 --> 01:20:24.554
<font color="#787878">According to your friend.
~ Yes.</font>

927
01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:28.122
<font color="#787878">My dead friend.</font>

928
01:20:30.281 --> 01:20:34.361
<font color="#787878">Laurent found out about
the things they could do,</font>

929
01:20:35.571 --> 01:20:37.571
<font color="#787878">and they killed him.</font>

930
01:20:39.203 --> 01:20:42.402
<font color="#787878">But not before he told me.</font>

931
01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.638
<font color="#787878">Maybe he was wrong.</font>

932
01:20:51.442 --> 01:20:53.196
<font color="#787878">I mean....</font>

933
01:20:53.296 --> 01:20:55.880
<font color="#787878">This is supposed to be....</font>

934
01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.915
<font color="#787878">Cullen territory.</font>

935
01:20:58.915 --> 01:21:03.901
<font color="#787878">But we've been tearing it up and I've never even seen them here.</font>

936
01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.177
<font color="#787878">You don't trust me.</font>

937
01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.390
<font color="#787878">With my life.
I'm just saying that....</font>

938
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:13.228
<font color="#787878">I'm doing this for us.
So that we can feed,</font>

939
01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:18.751
<font color="#787878">without their retaliation. I can't live in fear anymore,</font>

940
01:21:18.751 --> 01:21:20.306
<font color="#787878">waiting for them to attack.</font>

941
01:21:20.406 --> 01:21:23.431
<font color="#787878">I won't let them.</font>

942
01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:28.431
<font color="#787878">I'm going to end the Cullen clan.</font>

943
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.930
<font color="#787878">I swear.</font>

944
01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:53.665
<font color="#787878">I love you. So much.</font>

945
01:22:13.643 --> 01:22:15.643
<font color="#787878">You're going overboard.</font>

946
01:22:15.714 --> 01:22:18.227
<font color="#787878">If this is all I can contribute, I want to be thorough.</font>

947
01:22:18.327 --> 01:22:20.792
<font color="#787878">The newborns will be frantic.</font>

948
01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:26.169
<font color="#787878">It's Okay. Don't make yourself uncomfortable.</font>

949
01:22:26.269 --> 01:22:28.734
<font color="#787878">It doesn't bother me anymore.</font>

950
01:22:29.786 --> 01:22:31.193
<font color="#787878">Since when?</font>

951
01:22:31.293 --> 01:22:35.118
<font color="#787878">Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.</font>

952
01:22:35.931 --> 01:22:38.396
<font color="#787878">You're not wearing your ring.</font>

953
01:22:39.805 --> 01:22:43.035
<font color="#787878">Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.</font>

954
01:22:44.062 --> 01:22:46.102
<font color="#787878">Or risk Jacob seeing it?</font>

955
01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.380
<font color="#787878">I think we should wait to tell him. I mean, at least till after the fight.</font>

956
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.261
<font color="#787878">If you're having second thoughts....
~ I'm not.</font>

957
01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:58.021
<font color="#787878">I just want him to have a clear head.</font>

958
01:22:58.121 --> 01:23:00.121
<font color="#787878">Whose head is unclear?</font>

959
01:23:01.046 --> 01:23:03.046
<font color="#787878">Nobody's, I hope.</font>

960
01:23:03.767 --> 01:23:05.639
<font color="#787878">Alice says there's a storm coming.</font>

961
01:23:05.739 --> 01:23:09.456
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I can feel it.
We should get going.</font>

962
01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:13.671
<font color="#787878">I'll see you in a couple of hours.</font>

963
01:23:22.567 --> 01:23:24.567
<font color="#787878">Something up?</font>

964
01:23:26.884 --> 01:23:29.354
<font color="#787878">A bunch of vampires trying to kill me.</font>

965
01:23:29.454 --> 01:23:31.454
<font color="#787878">Same old, same old.</font>

966
01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:50.815
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

967
01:24:52.533 --> 01:24:54.362
<font color="#787878">You should get back before the storm hits.</font>

968
01:24:54.462 --> 01:24:56.181
<font color="#787878">No, I'm staying.</font>

969
01:24:56.281 --> 01:24:57.354
<font color="#787878">You'll need my connection to the pack,</font>

970
01:24:57.454 --> 01:24:58.953
<font color="#787878">to keep tabs on what's going on.</font>

971
01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:02.819
<font color="#787878">You're not going to fight?
~ Seth will spell me in the morning.</font>

972
01:25:02.919 --> 01:25:04.679
<font color="#787878">He's not happy about missing the action,</font>

973
01:25:04.779 --> 01:25:07.669
<font color="#787878">but it'll keep him out of trouble.</font>

974
01:25:07.695 --> 01:25:09.695
<font color="#787878">Let's get you inside.</font>

975
01:25:27.466 --> 01:25:29.544
<font color="#787878">I should have chosen a site lower down.</font>

976
01:25:29.644 --> 01:25:32.216
<font color="#787878">No, It's fine. I'm okay.</font>

977
01:25:33.239 --> 01:25:35.239
<font color="#787878">What can I do?</font>

978
01:25:47.518 --> 01:25:52.023
<font color="#787878">I can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on.</font>

979
01:25:58.131 --> 01:26:00.131
<font color="#787878">Forget it.</font>

980
01:26:00.575 --> 01:26:05.675
<font color="#787878">She may need her toes someday. And let's face it....</font>

981
01:26:05.675 --> 01:26:08.064
<font color="#787878">I'm hotter than you.</font>

982
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:15.340
<font color="#787878">Get your hand off me.</font>

983
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.637
<font color="#787878">Get your hands off her.</font>

984
01:26:17.637 --> 01:26:19.637
<font color="#787878">Don't fight.</font>

985
01:26:22.226 --> 01:26:24.631
<font color="#787878">She gets sick, it's on you.</font>

986
01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:43.260
<font color="#787878">Why.
you're freezing, Bella</font>

987
01:26:44.429 --> 01:26:48.056
<font color="#787878">Relax,
You'll warm up soon.</font>

988
01:26:49.386 --> 01:26:52.143
<font color="#787878">Faster if you took your clothes off.</font>

989
01:26:52.243 --> 01:26:55.628
<font color="#787878">Jake.
~ Survival one oh one.</font>

990
01:27:26.389 --> 01:27:30.639
<font color="#787878">Can you, at least attempt to control your thoughts?</font>

991
01:27:32.069 --> 01:27:36.744
<font color="#787878">I really get under that
ice cold skin of yours, don't I?</font>

992
01:27:38.062 --> 01:27:40.226
<font color="#787878">What?</font>

993
01:27:40.226 --> 01:27:43.456
<font color="#787878">Are you doubting her feelings for you?</font>

994
01:27:45.486 --> 01:27:47.383
<font color="#787878">Nice....</font>

995
01:27:47.483 --> 01:27:50.251
<font color="#787878">So picking through my brain's okay,</font>

996
01:27:50.351 --> 01:27:53.531
<font color="#787878">but letting me into yours, forget it.</font>

997
01:27:57.129 --> 01:27:59.129
<font color="#787878">Look....</font>

998
01:27:59.893 --> 01:28:03.178
<font color="#787878">I know she's in love with you.
~ Oh, good.</font>

999
01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.913
<font color="#787878">But she's in love with me, too.</font>

1000
01:28:07.893 --> 01:28:10.868
<font color="#787878">She just won't admit it to herself.</font>

1001
01:28:13.432 --> 01:28:16.237
<font color="#787878">I can't tell you if you're right.</font>

1002
01:28:17.327 --> 01:28:19.990
<font color="#787878">Then let me ask you something.</font>

1003
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:22.936
<font color="#787878">If she chooses me....
~ She won't.</font>

1004
01:28:23.266 --> 01:28:25.266
<font color="#787878">If she did.</font>

1005
01:28:26.474 --> 01:28:28.599
<font color="#787878">Would you try to kill me?</font>

1006
01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:31.547
<font color="#787878">That's an intriguing idea.</font>

1007
01:28:36.327 --> 01:28:40.032
<font color="#787878">But no.
I couldn't hurt her like that.</font>

1008
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:44.052
<font color="#787878">see, you'd just turn her into a bloodsucking demon like you.</font>

1009
01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:47.670
<font color="#787878">I don't want that.
I never wanted that.</font>

1010
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:50.122
<font color="#787878">So stop her.
~ I tried.</font>

1011
01:28:51.762 --> 01:28:54.907
<font color="#787878">I left.
~ But you gave up too quickly.</font>

1012
01:28:56.647 --> 01:29:00.235
<font color="#787878">If you'd stayed away another six months,</font>

1013
01:29:00.235 --> 01:29:03.523
<font color="#787878">I could've made her happy. Trust me.</font>

1014
01:29:04.976 --> 01:29:07.598
<font color="#787878">You have to consider....</font>

1015
01:29:07.598 --> 01:29:11.593
<font color="#787878">....that I might be better for her than you are.</font>

1016
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.590
<font color="#787878">I have considered that.</font>

1017
01:29:18.243 --> 01:29:20.538
<font color="#787878">I know you can protect her.</font>

1018
01:29:22.907 --> 01:29:26.449
<font color="#787878">But you can give her a life, a human life.</font>

1019
01:29:26.449 --> 01:29:28.489
<font color="#787878">It's all I want for her.</font>

1020
01:29:31.054 --> 01:29:32.766
<font color="#787878">But, I'm not....</font>

1021
01:29:32.866 --> 01:29:37.286
<font color="#787878">I'm not going to force her into anything, ever again.</font>

1022
01:29:38.704 --> 01:29:42.699
<font color="#787878">The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.</font>

1023
01:29:44.523 --> 01:29:47.033
<font color="#787878">Yeah, that I remember.</font>

1024
01:29:51.163 --> 01:29:53.883
<font color="#787878">When you thought she was gone....</font>

1025
01:29:55.768 --> 01:29:57.970
<font color="#787878">....that you'd lost her....</font>

1026
01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:03.532
<font color="#787878">How did you.... cope?</font>

1027
01:30:05.068 --> 01:30:07.068
<font color="#787878">There're no words.</font>

1028
01:30:12.822 --> 01:30:16.222
<font color="#787878">But I wouldn't wash it on anyone, Jacob.</font>

1029
01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:22.151
<font color="#787878">This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.</font>

1030
01:30:22.151 --> 01:30:24.151
<font color="#787878">Pretty neat.</font>

1031
01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:29.637
<font color="#787878">As much as I'd love to kill you, I'm glad she's warm.</font>

1032
01:30:31.476 --> 01:30:34.031
<font color="#787878">If we weren't natural enemies....</font>

1033
01:30:34.131 --> 01:30:38.332
<font color="#787878">....and you weren't trying to steal my reason for existing....</font>

1034
01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:40.809
<font color="#787878">I might actually like you.</font>

1035
01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:43.610
<font color="#787878">Well....</font>

1036
01:30:44.414 --> 01:30:49.453
<font color="#787878">If you weren't planning on sucking the life out of the girl I love,</font>

1037
01:30:49.553 --> 01:30:51.553
<font color="#787878">I might....</font>

1038
01:30:58.043 --> 01:31:01.653
<font color="#787878">No....
Not even then.</font>

1039
01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:13.200
<font color="#787878">But she could still
change her mind, you know.</font>

1040
01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.480
<font color="#787878">Then I'd let her go.</font>

1041
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:42.861
<font color="#787878">Fine. Hi, Seth.</font>

1042
01:31:45.841 --> 01:31:47.490
<font color="#787878">Where's Jacob?
Did he already....</font>

1043
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:49.590
<font color="#787878">Not yet.</font>

1044
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:55.440
<font color="#787878">He's checking to see if the woods are clear before he goes.</font>

1045
01:32:01.219 --> 01:32:03.549
<font color="#787878">I'm really sorry about last night.</font>

1046
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:05.182
<font color="#787878">I couldn't have been easy on you.</font>

1047
01:32:05.282 --> 01:32:09.221
<font color="#787878">It definitely won't make my list of top ten favorite evenings.</font>

1048
01:32:09.321 --> 01:32:11.321
<font color="#787878">You have a list?</font>

1049
01:32:11.808 --> 01:32:13.933
<font color="#787878">All ten I spent with you.</font>

1050
01:32:14.769 --> 01:32:18.339
<font color="#787878">Number one is when you said you'd marry me.</font>

1051
01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:20.417
<font color="#787878">Mrs. Cullen.</font>

1052
01:32:23.124 --> 01:32:25.025
<font color="#787878">This is the twenty-first century,</font>

1053
01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:27.695
<font color="#787878">I always wanna hyphenate my name.</font>

1054
01:32:27.795 --> 01:32:29.795
<font color="#787878">You're marrying him?</font>

1055
01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:32.210
<font color="#787878">Jake....</font>

1056
01:32:35.618 --> 01:32:37.828
<font color="#787878">You knew he was listening?</font>

1057
01:32:38.148 --> 01:32:40.148
<font color="#787878">He deserves to know.</font>

1058
01:32:40.542 --> 01:32:41.897
<font color="#787878">Jake, stop.
~ Bella, let him....</font>

1059
01:32:41.997 --> 01:32:43.997
<font color="#787878">Don't.</font>

1060
01:32:46.381 --> 01:32:48.381
<font color="#787878">Jake, stop.</font>

1061
01:32:51.245 --> 01:32:55.499
<font color="#787878">Jake, please.
~ I'm done. I'm so done.</font>

1062
01:32:56.068 --> 01:32:58.577
<font color="#787878">What can I do?
~ You can't do anything.</font>

1063
01:32:58.677 --> 01:33:01.311
<font color="#787878">I can. By going out there and killing something.</font>

1064
01:33:01.411 --> 01:33:04.577
<font color="#787878">No. You're not thinking clearly, don't do that.</font>

1065
01:33:04.677 --> 01:33:06.830
<font color="#787878">Maybe I'll get my self killed and make it simple for you.</font>

1066
01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:10.525
<font color="#787878">No. Just, Jake....
Stay.</font>

1067
01:33:11.349 --> 01:33:13.349
<font color="#787878">Why?</font>

1068
01:33:14.425 --> 01:33:16.670
<font color="#787878">Give me one good reason.</font>

1069
01:33:17.387 --> 01:33:20.022
<font color="#787878">Because I don't wanna lose you.</font>

1070
01:33:20.888 --> 01:33:22.888
<font color="#787878">It's not good enough.</font>

1071
01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.996
<font color="#787878">Because you're too important.</font>

1072
01:33:28.976 --> 01:33:30.976
<font color="#787878">Still not good enough.</font>

1073
01:33:31.748 --> 01:33:33.748
<font color="#787878">Jacob.</font>

1074
01:33:36.631 --> 01:33:38.631
<font color="#787878">Kiss me.</font>

1075
01:33:41.224 --> 01:33:45.568
<font color="#787878">I'm asking you to kiss me.</font>

1076
01:34:32.397 --> 01:34:35.542
<font color="#787878">That should have been our first kiss.</font>

1077
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:42.750
<font color="#787878">I gotta go.</font>

1078
01:34:45.053 --> 01:34:47.067
<font color="#787878">I'll be back.</font>

1079
01:35:16.615 --> 01:35:18.615
<font color="#787878">You saw.</font>

1080
01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:23.426
<font color="#787878">No. But Jacob's thoughts are very loud.</font>

1081
01:35:24.412 --> 01:35:26.707
<font color="#787878">I don't know what happened.</font>

1082
01:35:27.942 --> 01:35:29.942
<font color="#787878">You love him.</font>

1083
01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:35.875
<font color="#787878">I love you more.</font>

1084
01:35:37.332 --> 01:35:39.332
<font color="#787878">I know.</font>

1085
01:35:53.299 --> 01:35:55.299
<font color="#787878">It's starting.</font>

1086
01:36:54.944 --> 01:36:56.944
<font color="#787878">Jacob just got there.</font>

1087
01:37:02.675 --> 01:37:04.675
<font color="#787878">He's good.</font>

1088
01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:04.978
<font color="#787878">Someone's hurt?</font>

1089
01:38:05.397 --> 01:38:08.766
<font color="#787878">She's close.
I can hear her thoughts.</font>

1090
01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:10.766
<font color="#787878">Seth, go.</font>

1091
01:38:15.099 --> 01:38:17.628
<font color="#787878">She knew we weren't there, but she caught my scent.</font>

1092
01:38:17.728 --> 01:38:19.938
<font color="#787878">She knew you'd be with me.</font>

1093
01:38:20.583 --> 01:38:22.583
<font color="#787878">She found us.</font>

1094
01:38:25.676 --> 01:38:27.676
<font color="#787878">She's not alone.</font>

1095
01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:39.758
<font color="#787878">Riley....
Listen to me.</font>

1096
01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:44.099
<font color="#787878">Victoria's just using you, to distract me.</font>

1097
01:38:44.394 --> 01:38:46.774
<font color="#787878">But she knows I'll kill you.</font>

1098
01:38:49.585 --> 01:38:53.859
<font color="#787878">In fact, she'll be glad she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.</font>

1099
01:38:53.959 --> 01:38:55.959
<font color="#787878">Don't listen, Riley.</font>

1100
01:38:56.254 --> 01:38:58.339
<font color="#787878">I told you about their mind tricks.</font>

1101
01:38:58.439 --> 01:39:02.663
<font color="#787878">I can read her mind,
so I know what she thinks of you.</font>

1102
01:39:02.763 --> 01:39:04.401
<font color="#787878">He's lying.</font>

1103
01:39:04.501 --> 01:39:10.026
<font color="#787878">She only created you and this army to avenge her true mate, James.</font>

1104
01:39:10.403 --> 01:39:14.311
<font color="#787878">It's the only thing she cares about. Not you.</font>

1105
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:20.250
<font color="#787878">There's only you.
You know that.</font>

1106
01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:24.456
<font color="#787878">Think about it.</font>

1107
01:39:24.456 --> 01:39:29.256
<font color="#787878">You're from Forks,
you know the area.</font>

1108
01:39:29.822 --> 01:39:32.967
<font color="#787878">That's the only reason she chose you.</font>

1109
01:39:33.287 --> 01:39:35.287
<font color="#787878">She doesn't love you.</font>

1110
01:39:35.663 --> 01:39:37.882
<font color="#787878">Riley....</font>

1111
01:39:37.882 --> 01:39:41.402
<font color="#787878">Don't let him do this to us.</font>

1112
01:39:43.035 --> 01:39:45.557
<font color="#787878">You know I love you.</font>

1113
01:39:58.706 --> 01:40:00.706
<font color="#787878">You're dead.</font>

1114
01:40:14.861 --> 01:40:18.601
<font color="#787878">You won't get another chance like this again.</font>

1115
01:40:21.535 --> 01:40:23.535
<font color="#787878">You want her.</font>

1116
01:40:24.738 --> 01:40:29.583
<font color="#787878">You want me to feel the pain you felt when I killed James.</font>

1117
01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:33.186
<font color="#787878">When I tore him to pieces.</font>

1118
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:38.744
<font color="#787878">When I turned him into ash.</font>

1119
01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:45.007
<font color="#787878">When I turned him into nothing.</font>

1120
01:42:04.253 --> 01:42:06.583
<font color="#787878">Victoria.</font>

1121
01:42:06.583 --> 01:42:08.583
<font color="#787878">Victoria.</font>

1122
01:43:04.807 --> 01:43:08.625
<font color="#787878">Something's wrong.
~ Alice needs us to go.</font>

1123
01:43:08.625 --> 01:43:10.625
<font color="#787878">And now.</font>

1124
01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:35.610
<font color="#787878">How long?
~ A few minutes. Maybe ten.</font>

1125
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:36.992
<font color="#787878">The pack needs to leave.</font>

1126
01:43:37.092 --> 01:43:41.427
<font color="#787878">The Volturi won't honor a truce with the werewolves.</font>

1127
01:43:46.859 --> 01:43:48.859
<font color="#787878">Leah, don't.</font>

1128
01:44:05.183 --> 01:44:07.183
<font color="#787878">Jacob.</font>

1129
01:44:09.905 --> 01:44:12.576
<font color="#787878">Jacob. Hold on, Carlisle
is gonna take care of you.</font>

1130
01:44:12.676 --> 01:44:16.574
<font color="#787878">The bones on the right half of his body are shattered.</font>

1131
01:44:16.674 --> 01:44:19.139
<font color="#787878">Bella.
~ Jake, I'm right here.</font>

1132
01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:23.257
<font color="#787878">Jacob, you idiot. I had it.
~ Leah.</font>

1133
01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:26.080
<font color="#787878">I need to set the bones before his accelerated healing kicks in.</font>

1134
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.341
<font color="#787878">It's already starting.
~ We need to get him out of here.</font>

1135
01:44:28.441 --> 01:44:31.407
<font color="#787878">We're not gonna win a fight with the Volturi.</font>

1136
01:44:31.507 --> 01:44:34.750
<font color="#787878">We'll take him back to Billy's.
~ I'll be there as soon as I can.</font>

1137
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:36.850
<font color="#787878">Hang in there, Jake.</font>

1138
01:44:48.046 --> 01:44:50.046
<font color="#787878">We got you.</font>

1139
01:44:50.346 --> 01:44:52.346
<font color="#787878">They're coming.</font>

1140
01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.148
<font color="#787878">Impressive.</font>

1141
01:45:14.248 --> 01:45:18.740
<font color="#787878">I've never seen a coven escape an assault of this magnitude intact.</font>

1142
01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.840
<font color="#787878">We were lucky.</font>

1143
01:45:21.792 --> 01:45:23.792
<font color="#787878">I doubt that.</font>

1144
01:45:25.438 --> 01:45:28.152
<font color="#787878">It appears we missed an entertaining fight.</font>

1145
01:45:28.252 --> 01:45:31.981
<font color="#787878">Yes. It's not often
we're rendered unnecessary.</font>

1146
01:45:32.081 --> 01:45:36.583
<font color="#787878">If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would've fulfilled your purpose.</font>

1147
01:45:36.683 --> 01:45:38.683
<font color="#787878">Pity.</font>

1148
01:45:41.634 --> 01:45:43.634
<font color="#787878">You missed one.</font>

1149
01:45:50.136 --> 01:45:53.739
<font color="#787878">We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.</font>

1150
01:45:53.839 --> 01:45:56.134
<font color="#787878">That wasn't yours to offer.</font>

1151
01:45:58.946 --> 01:46:00.946
<font color="#787878">Why did you come?</font>

1152
01:46:06.297 --> 01:46:08.297
<font color="#787878">Who created you?</font>

1153
01:46:09.266 --> 01:46:10.298
<font color="#787878">You don't need to do that.</font>

1154
01:46:10.398 --> 01:46:12.666
<font color="#787878">She'll tell you anything you want to know.</font>

1155
01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.766
<font color="#787878">I know.</font>

1156
01:46:16.344 --> 01:46:18.737
<font color="#787878">I don't know</font>

1157
01:46:18.737 --> 01:46:20.817
<font color="#787878">Riley wouldn't tell us.</font>

1158
01:46:20.817 --> 01:46:23.014
<font color="#787878">He said our thoughts weren't safe.</font>

1159
01:46:23.114 --> 01:46:26.769
<font color="#787878">Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.</font>

1160
01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.753
<font color="#787878">Edward. If the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,</font>

1161
01:46:30.853 --> 01:46:33.063
<font color="#787878">they would've stopped her.</font>

1162
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:35.350
<font color="#787878">Isn't that right, Jane?</font>

1163
01:46:37.031 --> 01:46:39.031
<font color="#787878">Of course.</font>

1164
01:46:40.076 --> 01:46:42.076
<font color="#787878">Felix.</font>

1165
01:46:42.348 --> 01:46:45.323
<font color="#787878">She didn't know what she was doing.</font>

1166
01:46:45.755 --> 01:46:48.645
<font color="#787878">We'll take responsibility for her.</font>

1167
01:46:48.904 --> 01:46:50.904
<font color="#787878">Give her a chance.</font>

1168
01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:56.290
<font color="#787878">The Volturi don't give second chances.</font>

1169
01:46:57.336 --> 01:46:59.531
<font color="#787878">Keep that in mind.</font>

1170
01:46:59.531 --> 01:47:02.765
<font color="#787878">Caius will be interested to know that she's still human.</font>

1171
01:47:02.865 --> 01:47:04.865
<font color="#787878">The date is set.</font>

1172
01:47:07.882 --> 01:47:10.007
<font color="#787878">Take care of that, Felix.</font>

1173
01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.757
<font color="#787878">I'd like to go home.</font>

1174
01:47:46.941 --> 01:47:50.496
<font color="#787878">It's been going on for a while.
~ Doc's rebreaking his bones.</font>

1175
01:47:50.596 --> 01:47:52.423
<font color="#787878">Why'd he have to butt in? I could've taken that tick....</font>

1176
01:47:52.523 --> 01:47:54.648
<font color="#787878">Oh, give it a rest, Leah.</font>

1177
01:48:00.693 --> 01:48:03.517
<font color="#787878">The worst is over.
He'll be alright.</font>

1178
01:48:03.617 --> 01:48:04.588
<font color="#787878">I gave him some morphine,</font>

1179
01:48:04.688 --> 01:48:06.958
<font color="#787878">but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.</font>

1180
01:48:07.058 --> 01:48:09.778
<font color="#787878">I'll come back to set up a drip.</font>

1181
01:48:09.896 --> 01:48:11.896
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

1182
01:48:21.095 --> 01:48:23.095
<font color="#787878">He's asking for you.</font>

1183
01:48:37.368 --> 01:48:39.368
<font color="#787878">Hey, Jake.</font>

1184
01:48:42.084 --> 01:48:44.084
<font color="#787878">Hey.</font>

1185
01:48:56.077 --> 01:48:58.547
<font color="#787878">I was worried about you.</font>

1186
01:48:58.547 --> 01:49:00.757
<font color="#787878">You were worried about me?</font>

1187
01:49:01.789 --> 01:49:03.789
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

1188
01:49:04.384 --> 01:49:07.784
<font color="#787878">I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.</font>

1189
01:49:09.828 --> 01:49:11.977
<font color="#787878">Was he hard on you?</font>

1190
01:49:11.977 --> 01:49:15.971
<font color="#787878">He wasn't even mad at me. Or you.</font>

1191
01:49:17.231 --> 01:49:19.231
<font color="#787878">Well, damn.</font>

1192
01:49:21.204 --> 01:49:23.499
<font color="#787878">He's better than I thought.</font>

1193
01:49:23.808 --> 01:49:25.848
<font color="#787878">He's not playing a game.</font>

1194
01:49:27.824 --> 01:49:29.824
<font color="#787878">Right.</font>

1195
01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:34.610
<font color="#787878">Bella....</font>

1196
01:49:37.289 --> 01:49:40.544
<font color="#787878">He's not as perfect as you think.</font>

1197
01:49:43.509 --> 01:49:45.546
<font color="#787878">I know who he is.</font>

1198
01:49:49.651 --> 01:49:52.231
<font color="#787878">I must not talk about that.</font>

1199
01:49:53.228 --> 01:49:57.138
<font color="#787878">I'd rather get all the rebreaking done at once.</font>

1200
01:50:02.374 --> 01:50:05.859
<font color="#787878">At least I know I did everything I could.</font>

1201
01:50:09.064 --> 01:50:13.229
<font color="#787878">Wasn't easy making you
admit your feelings for me.</font>

1202
01:50:15.569 --> 01:50:21.009
<font color="#787878">I only fought them, because I know they wouldn't change anything.</font>

1203
01:50:26.983 --> 01:50:30.081
<font color="#787878">I'm exactly right for you, Bella.</font>

1204
01:50:32.438 --> 01:50:37.438
<font color="#787878">It would be as easy as breathing with me.</font>

1205
01:50:43.098 --> 01:50:45.498
<font color="#787878">You know I love you.</font>

1206
01:50:52.193 --> 01:50:55.508
<font color="#787878">You know how much I wish it was enough.</font>

1207
01:51:06.976 --> 01:51:08.976
<font color="#787878">Should I come back?</font>

1208
01:51:11.199 --> 01:51:13.633
<font color="#787878">I need some time.</font>

1209
01:51:17.653 --> 01:51:20.332
<font color="#787878">But I'll always be waiting.</font>

1210
01:51:24.777 --> 01:51:27.792
<font color="#787878">Until my heart stops beating.</font>

1211
01:51:29.838 --> 01:51:32.222
<font color="#787878">Maybe even then.</font>

1212
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:57.246
<font color="#787878">August thirteenth?
~ Yeah.</font>

1213
01:51:57.246 --> 01:51:59.143
<font color="#787878">it's a month before my birthday.</font>

1214
01:51:59.243 --> 01:52:03.153
<font color="#787878">I don't need to be
another year older than you.</font>

1215
01:52:03.184 --> 01:52:06.096
<font color="#787878">Alice said she can get
the wedding together by then.</font>

1216
01:52:06.196 --> 01:52:08.196
<font color="#787878">I'm sure she can.</font>

1217
01:52:10.104 --> 01:52:12.104
<font color="#787878">There's no rush.</font>

1218
01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:18.523
<font color="#787878">I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.</font>

1219
01:52:18.523 --> 01:52:22.291
<font color="#787878">And so, you're gonna let Alice plan the whole thing?</font>

1220
01:52:22.391 --> 01:52:23.568
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

1221
01:52:23.668 --> 01:52:26.649
<font color="#787878">Dress, the reception,
the guest list....</font>

1222
01:52:26.749 --> 01:52:30.149
<font color="#787878">I mean, who knows
who she's gonna invite?</font>

1223
01:52:31.657 --> 01:52:33.657
<font color="#787878">Does it matter?</font>

1224
01:52:37.748 --> 01:52:39.643
<font color="#787878">I just don't know why you're doing this.</font>

1225
01:52:39.743 --> 01:52:42.469
<font color="#787878">What? The wedding?</font>

1226
01:52:46.121 --> 01:52:49.691
<font color="#787878">You're trying to make everyone else happy.</font>

1227
01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:53.101
<font color="#787878">But you're already giving away too much.</font>

1228
01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:55.308
<font color="#787878">You're wrong.</font>

1229
01:53:02.785 --> 01:53:06.355
<font color="#787878">This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.</font>

1230
01:53:09.881 --> 01:53:14.236
<font color="#787878">It was between who I should be and who I am.</font>

1231
01:53:17.785 --> 01:53:20.250
<font color="#787878">I've always felt out of step.</font>

1232
01:53:20.755 --> 01:53:24.240
<font color="#787878">Like literally,
stumbling through my life.</font>

1233
01:53:25.808 --> 01:53:27.808
<font color="#787878">I'm never felt normal.</font>

1234
01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:32.492
<font color="#787878">Because I'm not normal.</font>

1235
01:53:33.654 --> 01:53:35.654
<font color="#787878">I don't wanna be.</font>

1236
01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:40.009
<font color="#787878">I've had to face death....</font>

1237
01:53:40.009 --> 01:53:43.985
<font color="#787878">....and loss and pain,
in your world.</font>

1238
01:53:43.985 --> 01:53:47.130
<font color="#787878">But, I've also never felt stronger....</font>

1239
01:53:49.975 --> 01:53:53.086
<font color="#787878">....more real, more....
my self.</font>

1240
01:53:55.126 --> 01:53:57.421
<font color="#787878">Because it's my world, too.</font>

1241
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:02.927
<font color="#787878">It's where I belong.</font>

1242
01:54:09.273 --> 01:54:11.792
<font color="#787878">So, it's not just about me.</font>

1243
01:54:13.572 --> 01:54:15.572
<font color="#787878">No, sorry.</font>

1244
01:54:19.017 --> 01:54:23.000
<font color="#787878">I've made a mess trying
to figure all this out, but....</font>

1245
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.100
<font color="#787878">I wanna do it right.</font>

1246
01:54:25.437 --> 01:54:28.352
<font color="#787878">And I wanna tie my self to you,</font>

1247
01:54:28.352 --> 01:54:30.912
<font color="#787878">in every way humanly possible.</font>

1248
01:54:34.129 --> 01:54:36.169
<font color="#787878">Starting with a wedding.</font>

1249
01:54:40.074 --> 01:54:42.334
<font color="#787878">Actually....</font>

1250
01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:45.843
<font color="#787878">Something,
a little more difficult first.</font>

1251
01:54:45.843 --> 01:54:47.968
<font color="#787878">And maybe even dangerous.</font>

1252
01:54:53.058 --> 01:54:55.159
<font color="#787878">We have to tell Charlie.</font>

1253
01:54:58.623 --> 01:55:00.842
<font color="#787878">It's highly dangerous.</font>

1254
01:55:00.842 --> 01:55:03.987
<font color="#787878">It's a good thing you're bulletproof.</font>

1255
01:55:05.226 --> 01:55:07.508
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna need that ring.</font>
