00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.473
Move! Move it!

3
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:04.515
Move!

4
00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.310
Move!

5
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:08.395
Now!

6
00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.342
It's me home.

7
00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:41.135
Bye, Bruno!
Bye, Bruno!

8
00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.039
Hello, sweetheart.
Mum, what's going on?

9
00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:13.043
We're celebrating.
Celebrating?

10
00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.045
Your father's been given a promotion.

11
00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.546
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

12
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.050
So we're having a little
party to celebrate.

13
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.510
He's still going to be a soldier
though, isn't he?

14
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.347
Yes, my love.
Yes, just a more important one now.

15
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.351
There's some even more exciting news,

16
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.811
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

17
00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:38.109
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

18
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.906
That's miles away. What about
Karl and Leon and Martin?

19
00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.407
Sweetheart, I know it's hard,

20
00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:48.078
but we're all having to say good-bye
to our friends for the time being.

21
00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.747
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

22
00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:52.915
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

23
00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:59.005
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

24
00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:02.424
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

25
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.260
But this is the best house ever.

26
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.100
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

27
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.267
Dad says it's got a garden.
Mm-hmm.

28
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.274
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

29
00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:21.569
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

30
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.572
so if your country needs you
to go somewhere, you'll go.

31
00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:28.118
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier...

32
00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:32.037
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

33
00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:18.293
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

34
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.587
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

35
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.505
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

36
00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:27.010
So, you two,

37
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.263
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

38
00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:33.099
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing, so I suppose it must be.

39
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.059
Mmm.

40
00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:40.814
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

41
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.156
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler!

42
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.692
Congratulations.

43
00:07:27.154 --> 00:07:30.572
Doesn't he look wonderful?
Absolutely.

44
00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:33.742
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

45
00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:38.748
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

46
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:42.710
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

47
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:46.923
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie.

48
00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:49.883
Does it still make you
feel special, Ralf dear?

49
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:53.930
The uniform and what it stands for?

50
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:57.517
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

51
00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.102
Me, spoil things?

52
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:03.690
You should be careful.

53
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:07.735
Airing your views so publicly could
land you in trouble. You know that.

54
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:13.950
So, how long are we losing you for, my boy?

55
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:18.996
Until the war is won, I would think.
Well, not so long then.

All right, Bruno.
Time to say good-bye.

66
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.312
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye!

67
00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:46.269
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep.

68
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.772
Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee.

69
00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:53.276
Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more.

70
00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:56.863
And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same...

71
00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:57.904
Amen.

72
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:46.745
Children, look.
Look! Our new home.

73
00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:39.464
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

74
00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.316
Well, what do we think?

75
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.406
Oh, come on. It's lovely.

76
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:06.867
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come...

77
00:13:08.495 --> 00:13:10.412
and help you unpack.

78
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:28.096
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

79
00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:33.185
Well, it's not for me to say.

80
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:38.399
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

81
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.782
Is he already up?

82
00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:54.373
Who was that?

83
00:13:54.374 --> 00:13:57.084
One of your
father's soldiers, I suppose.

84
00:13:57.085 --> 00:14:01.463
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

85
00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:10.263
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

86
00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:48.761
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

87
00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:51.847
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

88
00:14:51.848 --> 00:14:54.267
You can only see it from my room.

89
00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:56.686
Hmm.
And are some children there?

90
00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:59.564
Yes, quite a few.
That's good.

91
00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:03.401
So, I'll be able to play with them.
I don't see why not.

92
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:07.780
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like,

93
00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:11.032
because they look a bit strange.
The children do?

94
00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:14.537
Well, and the farmers.
What sort of strange?

95
00:15:19.626 --> 00:15:21.209
I'm sorry.

96
00:15:22.045 --> 00:15:23.045
Vegetables.

97
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.047
There.

98
00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:31.929
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

99
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.931
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

100
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.686
Thank you, ma'am.

101
00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:45.066
Bruno.

102
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.029
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

103
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.697
The farmers. They wear pajamas.

104
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.884
Bruno, I was just coming to look for you.

105
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:13.596
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

106
00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:15.878
I'll be over to see you later.
Of course, Herr Kommandant.

107
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.725
Come in.

108
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.939
Sit down, sit down.

109
00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:28.109
Well, what do you think?

110
00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.446
Oh, dear.

111
00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:33.782
I want to go home.

112
00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:39.622
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

113
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:41.289
Isn't that right?

114
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:47.588
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

115
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:49.298
I promise you,
it won't be long before you-

116
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:54.344
Why do the farmers wear pajamas?
I can see them from my window.

117
00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:07.315
The thing is, Bruno, those people-

118
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.277
Well, you see, they're not
really people at all.

119
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.244
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

120
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:19.994
Was it Maria?
No.

121
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:22.288
It is a farm, isn't it?

122
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:25.251
Yes.

123
00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:30.131
Is it to do with your new job?

124
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.967
All you need to know about
my work here, Bruno,

125
00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:36.720
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

126
00:17:37.597 --> 00:17:40.015
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place...

127
00:17:40.016 --> 00:17:41.100
for you to grow up in.

128
00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:43.852
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

129
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:47.648
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

130
00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:51.526
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

131
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:54.864
I don't think so,
Bruno. No.

132
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:58.492
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit-

133
00:17:58.493 --> 00:18:00.452
Well, they're different.

134
00:18:01.037 --> 00:18:03.789
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends,

135
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.499
but they won't be the ones from the farm.

136
00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:10.421
Ralf, you promised. You said
it was miles away. It is.

137
00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.048
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

138
00:18:13.049 --> 00:18:14.549
There was one of them in our kitchen.

139
00:18:57.093 --> 00:18:59.886
Master Bruno, how
are you today? Fed up.

140
00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.350
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

141
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:07.436
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

142
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:09.979
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

143
00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:16.904
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

144
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.197
One thing's for sure,

145
00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:21.950
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

146
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:17.172
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

147
00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:20.467
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

148
00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:23.095
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

149
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:26.306
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

150
00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:30.435
Come back in now, and
we'll think of something.

151
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:00.674
So, children, what are you doing today?

152
00:21:00.675 --> 00:21:03.052
Same as yesterday.
And what was that?

153
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.512
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

154
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:10.517
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

155
00:21:10.518 --> 00:21:14.438
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

156
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:15.772
The back garden?

157
00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.484
Well, God forbid.

158
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:20.819
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

159
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.237
I even miss school.

160
00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:27.201
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

161
00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:29.203
Anyway, you won't be missing
it for long. Really?

162
00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:32.288
I've arranged a tutor for you both.

163
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.917
A Herr Liszt will be visiting twice a week.

164
00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:39.504
So we're not going to school?

165
00:21:41.716 --> 00:21:43.591
School's coming here?
Mm-hmm.

166
00:21:44.427 --> 00:21:46.886
On an old bicycle, I gather.

167
00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.365
It's a bird without the-

168
00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:35.893
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

169
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:39.731
Can I ask you a favor?
Well, you can ask.

170
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.819
Are there any spare tires around?

171
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.363
An old one from one of
the trucks or something?

172
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:49.283
Well, the only spare tire
I've seen around here...

173
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:50.909
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

174
00:22:57.417 --> 00:23:00.835
Well, is he using it?
Yes, he's very attached to it.

175
00:23:01.629 --> 00:23:04.673
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

176
00:23:04.674 --> 00:23:08.176
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

177
00:23:10.346 --> 00:23:12.306
What do you want a tire for, anyway?

178
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:15.350
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

179
00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:17.351
That does sound exciting.

180
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:24.902
You!

181
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:27.528
Here, now.

182
00:23:30.241 --> 00:23:31.574
Move!

183
00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:36.662
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

184
00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:39.792
There are some tires in there.
He will select one.

185
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:42.043
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

186
00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:49.383
Well, little man, what are you waiting for?

187
00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.638
How about this one?

188
00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:24.729
Where's my mum?

189
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:27.815
She's out.

190
00:25:28.735 --> 00:25:31.235
When is she back?
Soon, I expect.

191
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.155
But don't worry.

192
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:39.452
But I might bleed to death.
No, you won't.

193
00:25:46.502 --> 00:25:51.505
Will I need to go to hospital?
No. It's only a small cut.

194
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.677
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

195
00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:00.890
There, all better.

196
00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:16.572
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

197
00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:22.162
Now, you better sit still
for a few minutes...

198
00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:24.915
before you start walking
around on that again.

199
00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:26.999
Will you tell my mum what happened?

200
00:26:28.544 --> 00:26:31.379
I think she's going to see it for herself.

201
00:26:32.423 --> 00:26:34.924
She'll probably want to
take me to a doctor.

202
00:26:36.302 --> 00:26:38.136
I don't think so.

203
00:26:38.137 --> 00:26:41.305
It could be worse than it looks.
It isn't.

204
00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:45.268
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

205
00:26:49.732 --> 00:26:52.818
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

206
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.110
You peel potatoes.

207
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:58.072
I practiced as a doctor.

208
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:00.993
Before I-

209
00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:03.077
Before I came here.

210
00:27:04.163 --> 00:27:08.040
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practice.

211
00:27:16.592 --> 00:27:21.220
Now, what are you going
to be when you grow up?

212
00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:25.433
I know. An explorer.

213
00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:27.393
How do you know that?

214
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.440
Is it nice on the farm?

215
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.745
Bruno. Bruno,
what happened to you?

216
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:48.582
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

217
00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:52.209
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

218
00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:01.511
Go to your room.
But Pavel says I-

219
00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:03.679
Don't argue. Go to your room.

220
00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:33.167
Thank you.

221
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.320
It's not fair, you having this view.

222
00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:02.239
Well, I'm not swapping.

223
00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.245
I think school's here.

224
00:29:10.998 --> 00:29:13.333
No, I mean more recent history.

225
00:29:13.334 --> 00:29:17.170
Are you interested in current affairs?
Yes, very.

226
00:29:17.171 --> 00:29:21.007
So, you'll be aware of the situation...

227
00:29:21.008 --> 00:29:22.928
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

228
00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:27.889
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men...

229
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.975
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

230
00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:34.562
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

231
00:29:36.357 --> 00:29:40.025
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

232
00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:43.112
Good. What sort of books?

233
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.199
Adventure books, mainly.

234
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.371
You know, knights in shining armor,
exploring strange lands and stuff,

235
00:29:51.372 --> 00:29:54.124
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

236
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:58.544
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

237
00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:01.715
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books...

238
00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:03.884
and start learning about fact.

239
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:07.929
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world,

240
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.598
and I believe this would
be the perfect start.

241
00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:48.070
Die, die!

242
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.292
Die, die.

243
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.096
Hello.

244
00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:03.687
I'm exploring.

245
00:33:09.403 --> 00:33:12.988
- What are you doing?
- We're-We're building a new hut.

246
00:33:19.121 --> 00:33:21.914
Have you got lots
of friends over there?

247
00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:26.002
A few. But we fight a lot.

248
00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:30.631
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

249
00:33:33.135 --> 00:33:35.844
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

250
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.472
Sorry?
I'm Shmuel.

251
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:44.020
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

252
00:33:44.021 --> 00:33:46.314
I've never heard of anyone called Bruno.

253
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:50.693
But Shmuel.
No one's called Shmuel.

254
00:33:56.158 --> 00:33:58.492
I live in the house, back there.

255
00:34:01.664 --> 00:34:04.498
Have you got any food on you?
No.

256
00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:07.459
- Are you hungry?
- Mmm.

257
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.303
How old are you?

258
00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:21.390
- Eight.
- Me, too!

259
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.443
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own,

260
00:34:31.444 --> 00:34:34.028
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

261
00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:37.574
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

262
00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:41.077
Isn't it a part of a game or something?
It's just my number.

263
00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:43.538
Everyone gets given a different number.

264
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:45.582
Right. Then what happens?

265
00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:51.546
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

266
00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:52.588
Yeah.

267
00:34:53.215 --> 00:34:56.217
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

268
00:34:56.218 --> 00:34:58.510
And you, Bruno.

269
00:35:00.514 --> 00:35:01.722
Come back!

270
00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.397
Bye.

271
00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:24.496
Mum, I can't find my football.

272
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:26.377
Well, it'll be in one of
your cupboards, sweet.

273
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.081
It isn't. I've looked.

274
00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.959
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

275
00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:33.253
Mmm. A piece. Yes.

276
00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:42.388
Bruno?

277
00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:46.476
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

278
00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:49.812
- For your football.
- Oh.

279
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.934
Damn.

280
00:36:55.045 --> 00:36:58.505
- Gretel, I've just seen all your-
- All my what?

281
00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:02.801
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

282
00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:06.890
Dolls are for little girls.

283
00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.642
It's not right to be
playing with silly toys...

284
00:37:09.643 --> 00:37:12.895
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

285
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:58.440
"My people's density is my density."
Destiny.

286
00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:04.781
"Its struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

287
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:08.493
"I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland."

288
00:38:08.494 --> 00:38:11.162
"The history of my people
is great and glorious."

289
00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:12.663
And it's 12:00.

290
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:19.044
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

291
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:23.216
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno,

292
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:26.134
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue?

293
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.193
Bruno, there you are.

294
00:38:44.154 --> 00:38:47.531
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

295
00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.118
You be careful on that thing.

296
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.413
Thank you.

297
00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.142
Can I ask you something?

298
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:16.852
Why do you people wear pajamas all day?

299
00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:21.189
- They're not pajamas.
- Well, those.

300
00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:24.861
We have to. They took
all our other clothes away.

301
00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.779
Who did?
The soldiers.

302
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.447
The soldiers? Why?

303
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:34.453
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

304
00:39:35.122 --> 00:39:38.248
I do, quite.
My dad's a soldier,

305
00:39:38.917 --> 00:39:41.501
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

306
00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:43.879
What sort, then?

307
00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:48.509
Well, he's the important sort.

308
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.970
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

309
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:57.934
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

310
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:03.774
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

311
00:40:06.695 --> 00:40:08.946
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up...

312
00:40:08.947 --> 00:40:12.116
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

313
00:40:12.117 --> 00:40:14.576
Do you know him?
Lives over there.

314
00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:20.749
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

315
00:40:30.385 --> 00:40:32.011
Can I ask you another question?

316
00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:34.680
What do you burn in those chimneys?

317
00:40:34.681 --> 00:40:38.434
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

318
00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:41.562
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

319
00:40:41.563 --> 00:40:43.230
Mama says it's old clothes.

320
00:40:43.857 --> 00:40:46.442
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

321
00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:52.156
I wish you'd remembered the chocolate.

322
00:40:52.157 --> 00:40:53.866
Yes, I'm sorry.

323
00:40:53.867 --> 00:40:56.702
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

324
00:40:56.703 --> 00:40:59.496
I can't, can I? Because of this.

325
00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:02.834
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

326
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:06.420
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

327
00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:08.588
Are you not allowed out?

328
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.635
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

329
00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:27.941
I think I should go now.

330
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.825
Will you be here tomorrow?
I'll try.

331
00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:38.493
Good-bye, then!
Bye.

332
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:45.041
Little present, sweetheart.

333
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.297
Thank you, Mummy.

334
00:41:58.223 --> 00:42:01.141
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

335
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.993
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

336
00:42:18.994 --> 00:42:20.452
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

337
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:25.958
Hey, did you smell that
horrible smell the other day?

338
00:42:25.959 --> 00:42:28.877
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

339
00:42:30.672 --> 00:42:32.839
The day I fell off the swing.

340
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.385
Did you smell it, Mum?
Father.

341
00:42:36.386 --> 00:42:37.761
Mum.

342
00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.349
Let me speak to her.

343
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.266
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

344
00:42:46.688 --> 00:42:49.022
Yes. We look forward to it.
Good-bye.

345
00:42:54.821 --> 00:42:57.197
Is Grandma not coming?
No.

346
00:42:57.699 --> 00:43:01.201
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

347
00:43:03.372 --> 00:43:05.581
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

348
00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:09.084
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

349
00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:15.216
I think they just burn
rubbish there sometimes.

350
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:16.925
Look.
What?

351
00:43:20.138 --> 00:43:21.513
Hey!
Gretel.

352
00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:24.767
Hey, that's not fair!

353
00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.226
- Gretel.
- What?

354
00:43:27.145 --> 00:43:28.770
It's only a game.

355
00:43:34.152 --> 00:43:36.737
Ralf, this tutor you brought in,

356
00:43:36.738 --> 00:43:40.490
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

357
00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.827
I believe so. Why?

358
00:43:42.828 --> 00:43:44.829
Well, do we know what he's teaching them?

359
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.747
Gretel seems to have
become so-

360
00:43:46.748 --> 00:43:49.375
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

361
00:43:49.376 --> 00:43:51.126
They mustn't get left behind.

362
00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:54.587
Come on.

363
00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:56.464
Let's get to bed.

364
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:10.896
"The Jew slandered us and
incited our enemies."

365
00:44:10.897 --> 00:44:13.357
The Jew corrupted us through bad books.

366
00:44:13.358 --> 00:44:15.443
He mocked our literature and our music.

367
00:44:15.444 --> 00:44:17.945
Everywhere, his influence was destructive,

368
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:21.198
the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse,

369
00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:22.782
and then-"
Yes, Bruno?

370
00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:25.870
I don't understand.

371
00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:28.413
A nation's collapse is all
down to this one man?

372
00:44:28.957 --> 00:44:32.543
The Jew here means the entire Jewish race.

373
00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:34.587
If it had been just one man,

374
00:44:34.588 --> 00:44:37.255
I'm sure something would've
been done about him.

375
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:42.553
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

376
00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:46.306
I think, Bruno, if you
ever found a nice Jew,

377
00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:50.518
you would be the best
explorer in the world.

378
00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:56.358
Continue, Gretel.

379
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.489
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity."

380
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.241
The Jew is not creative, but destructive.

381
00:45:04.242 --> 00:45:06.744
He is the enemy of culture.

382
00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:10.080
"Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

383
00:45:23.428 --> 00:45:24.928
Master Bruno.

384
00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:29.600
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

385
00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:33.521
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

386
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:36.607
But don't make a mess of
your satchel. Bring it here.

387
00:45:36.608 --> 00:45:40.986
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

388
00:45:40.987 --> 00:45:42.695
Bruno, what is it?

389
00:45:43.573 --> 00:45:46.075
What are you doing with your satchel?

390
00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:50.703
Herr Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.

391
00:45:52.207 --> 00:45:54.375
- Let me see.
- What?

392
00:45:54.376 --> 00:45:57.169
The books.
No.

393
00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.380
Bruno, I just want to see
what books Herr Liszt has given you.

394
00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.175
I told a lie.
What?

395
00:46:05.554 --> 00:46:07.053
I've just got...

396
00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:11.266
adventure books.

397
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:21.860
Go on. Off you go, then.

398
00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:27.908
Now, Maria, there's
two extra for supper tonight.

399
00:46:27.909 --> 00:46:29.160
The Kommandant's father will be here,

400
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:31.494
and I believe Lieutenant
Kotler is joining us.

401
00:46:54.352 --> 00:46:55.477
Here.

402
00:47:06.948 --> 00:47:08.615
What's the matter?

403
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.828
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

404
00:47:15.582 --> 00:47:17.750
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

405
00:47:17.751 --> 00:47:19.334
It's just a ball. Come on.

406
00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:24.631
Do you not like playing?

407
00:47:28.887 --> 00:47:31.638
- Just not ball games?
- Not here.

408
00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.687
Tell me how the number game works.

409
00:47:38.688 --> 00:47:41.440
I told you, it's not a game.
We just all have numbers.

410
00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.823
Shmuel!

411
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:06.673
Bruno! What are you doing?

412
00:48:08.426 --> 00:48:11.553
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

413
00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.316
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

414
00:48:24.317 --> 00:48:25.400
What?

415
00:48:42.335 --> 00:48:44.043
But, surely you-

416
00:48:59.853 --> 00:49:02.354
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

417
00:49:02.355 --> 00:49:04.564
From your own wife.
Yes.

418
00:49:08.737 --> 00:49:13.031
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

419
00:49:14.659 --> 00:49:18.495
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

420
00:49:18.496 --> 00:49:23.416
- You want this country to be strong-
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

421
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.673
How can you-

422
00:49:29.674 --> 00:49:31.383
Because I'm a soldier.
How can you-

423
00:49:31.384 --> 00:49:34.219
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

424
00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.929
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

425
00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:42.519
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

426
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.439
cannot be achieved without
work such as this!

427
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:53.488
Elsa. Elsa.
Get away from me! Get away from me!

428
00:49:57.702 --> 00:49:58.952
Grandpa's here.

429
00:49:58.953 --> 00:50:00.953
I don't believe this.
Grandpa's here.

430
00:50:05.251 --> 00:50:06.501
We'll be through in a moment.

431
00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:18.471
Who told you about this?

432
00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:53.298
How's Grandma?

433
00:50:53.299 --> 00:50:55.843
She's a bit under the weather, I'm afraid.

434
00:50:55.844 --> 00:51:00.431
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

435
00:51:00.432 --> 00:51:03.474
Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
Oh, absolutely.

436
00:51:10.358 --> 00:51:14.944
You know, Ralf, your mother really is sick.

437
00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:18.699
She's been talking about
this visit for weeks.

438
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.867
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

439
00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:30.877
So, your father tells
me that you've got a tutor.

440
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:34.006
Yes. He's nice.

441
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:36.674
But he won't let
us read any adventure books.

442
00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:39.970
All we do is boring, old history.

443
00:51:39.971 --> 00:51:42.514
Let me tell you something, young man.

444
00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:46.350
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

445
00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.729
The work your father is doing here,

446
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.940
history in the making.

447
00:52:03.244 --> 00:52:06.872
When I was your age, history was
my favorite subject by miles,

448
00:52:06.873 --> 00:52:09.041
which obviously didn't please my father.

449
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.001
Why not?

450
00:52:11.002 --> 00:52:14.046
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

451
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:17.924
Really, does he still teach?

452
00:52:20.386 --> 00:52:23.888
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

453
00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:31.521
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

454
00:52:34.108 --> 00:52:35.775
Really, when?

455
00:52:37.946 --> 00:52:41.239
About four years ago, Herr Kommandant.

456
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:49.247
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

457
00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:51.165
Where did he go?

458
00:52:59.717 --> 00:53:01.425
Lieutenant Kotler,

459
00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:06.305
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

460
00:53:12.146 --> 00:53:15.189
I believe it was Switzerland,
Herr Kommandant.

461
00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.986
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland...

462
00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:20.988
at the very moment it needed him most.

463
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:23.448
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

464
00:53:23.449 --> 00:53:24.824
More wine!

465
00:53:27.245 --> 00:53:30.080
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

466
00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:31.081
Herr Kommandant?

467
00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:34.542
Did he go there to take the air?

468
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:39.047
I'm afraid I really don't
know, Herr Kommandant.

469
00:53:39.048 --> 00:53:41.091
You'd have to ask him.

470
00:53:41.092 --> 00:53:43.886
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

471
00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:46.012
With him being in Switzerland.

472
00:53:46.848 --> 00:53:47.889
Come on!

473
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:51.851
What's the matter with you tonight?

474
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:05.031
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

475
00:54:07.035 --> 00:54:09.368
Unless, of course, he had disagreements.

476
00:54:11.664 --> 00:54:15.584
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

477
00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:19.963
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

478
00:54:19.964 --> 00:54:23.717
Even so, all of them traitors.
Absolutely right.

479
00:54:23.718 --> 00:54:28.055
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

480
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:31.766
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

481
00:54:33.895 --> 00:54:35.102
Lieutenant Kotler!

482
00:54:36.522 --> 00:54:39.565
You cretin Jew! Filth!

483
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:51.328
Pig!

484
00:54:51.329 --> 00:54:52.578
Ralf!

485
00:54:57.752 --> 00:54:59.001
Jew!

486
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:04.091
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

487
00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:05.257
The Jew deserved it.

488
00:55:14.936 --> 00:55:18.855
Can I ask you something about the farm?

489
00:55:18.856 --> 00:55:21.774
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

490
00:55:40.628 --> 00:55:44.589
It's a camp.
What's called a work camp.

491
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:47.091
For Jews, obviously.

492
00:55:48.636 --> 00:55:50.428
Just Jews?

493
00:55:51.305 --> 00:55:54.224
Because they're the best workers?

494
00:55:54.225 --> 00:55:55.976
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

495
00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:58.228
They're no good at anything.

496
00:55:58.229 --> 00:55:59.896
They're in there because they're evil.

497
00:55:59.897 --> 00:56:02.315
They're the enemy.
The enemy?

498
00:56:02.316 --> 00:56:04.276
But I thought we were fighting-
They're evil, Bruno.

499
00:56:04.277 --> 00:56:06.652
Evil, dangerous vermin.

500
00:56:07.321 --> 00:56:09.030
They're the reason we lost the Great War.

501
00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:14.202
Haven't you been listening to anything
Herr Liszt has been telling us?

502
00:56:14.203 --> 00:56:15.619
No. Not really.

503
00:56:18.499 --> 00:56:21.793
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

504
00:56:21.794 --> 00:56:26.465
Of course, he is.
But he's in charge of a horrible place.

505
00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:29.176
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

506
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:31.762
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

507
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:34.388
He's making the country great again.

508
00:57:26.567 --> 00:57:29.861
Like you say, they're
a bit strange. A bit-

509
00:57:29.862 --> 00:57:30.987
Well, they're different.

510
00:57:30.988 --> 00:57:33.073
They're the enemy, Bruno.

511
00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:34.866
Evil, dangerous vermin.

512
00:57:34.867 --> 00:57:38.077
Well, you see, they're
not really people at all.

513
00:58:02.103 --> 00:58:04.604
What are you doing here?

514
00:58:04.605 --> 00:58:08.774
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

515
00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:24.791
We're not supposed to
be friends, you and me.

516
00:58:24.792 --> 00:58:27.751
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

517
00:58:34.802 --> 00:58:36.468
Do you want some?

518
00:58:46.981 --> 00:58:49.607
What's your dad like?
What's he like?

519
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:51.734
Is he a good man?

520
00:58:54.655 --> 00:58:56.447
You've never thought he wasn't?

521
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:01.660
And you're proud of him?

522
00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:05.039
Aren't you proud of yours?

523
00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.128
Is it really horrible in the camp?

524
00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.591
How dare you talk to people in the house.

525
00:59:14.592 --> 00:59:16.842
How dare you!

526
00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:20.888
Are you eating?

527
00:59:23.476 --> 00:59:25.643
Have you been stealing food?

528
00:59:29.482 --> 00:59:33.776
Answer me!
No, sir. He gave it to me.

529
00:59:34.445 --> 00:59:35.569
He's my friend.

530
00:59:38.324 --> 00:59:39.698
What?

531
00:59:42.328 --> 00:59:43.328
Little man,

532
00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:47.791
do you know this Jew?

533
00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:49.501
Do you know this Jew?

534
00:59:49.502 --> 00:59:52.837
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

535
00:59:52.838 --> 00:59:55.839
I've never seen him before in my life.

536
01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:07.017
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

537
01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.105
When I come back, we'll
have a little chat...

538
01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.941
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

539
01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:58.171
New arrivals here are
happy to discover that life in the camp...

540
01:01:58.172 --> 01:01:59.381
is not all work.

541
01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.759
And that there's
ample opportunity for leisure also.

542
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.220
At the end of their day
at the ironmongery...

543
01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.847
or the build or boot factory,
the workers can enjoy...

544
01:02:07.848 --> 01:02:11.183
the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer.

545
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.896
Organized sport is very popular.

546
01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.981
Those that don't play
certainly enjoy watching.

547
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.569
At the end of the working day,

548
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:24.030
the centrally located café
is the ideal place...

549
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:28.617
for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal.

550
01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:33.497
The children, in particular,
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.

551
01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:41.631
In the evenings, the
occasional music concerts,

552
01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:44.717
either by visiting orchestras
or, indeed, by talented musicians...

553
01:02:44.718 --> 01:02:47.553
from within the camp itself,
are always well attended.

554
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.392
Other recreations include
reading in the library,

555
01:02:52.393 --> 01:02:58.356
pottery, cookery, art and horticulture
for adult and child alike.

556
01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:02.526
Almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp.

557
01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:09.534
Splendid.

558
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.920
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

559
01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.801
Good-bye, little man.

560
01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.017
Shmuel! Shmuel!

561
01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:18.371
I don't understand.

562
01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:20.872
I saw a film about the camp,

563
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:24.126
and it looked so nice.

564
01:05:31.552 --> 01:05:33.970
I don't know why I did it.

565
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:36.806
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

566
01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:38.974
and that soldier's so scary.

567
01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:47.984
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

568
01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:52.821
I thought maybe we weren't friends anymore.

569
01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:05.626
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

570
01:06:37.201 --> 01:06:40.661
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

571
01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.957
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

572
01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:50.046
He's been moved to the front.

573
01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.006
It was felt that his
youth and enthusiasm...

574
01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.841
would be put to better use there.

575
01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:55.967
Herr Kommandant, telephone.

576
01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:59.472
In actual fact, Gretel,
he was sent there...

577
01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:01.307
because he failed to
inform the authorities...

578
01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:03.643
of his father's lack of
loyalty to the Party.

579
01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:05.687
Which was his duty, I might add.

580
01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.855
Which was his bad luck.
Bad luck?

581
01:07:07.856 --> 01:07:12.026
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

582
01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:14.861
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

583
01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:22.869
What?
When will Pavel be back?

584
01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:28.125
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

585
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.715
It's Father. They've been bombed.

586
01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.556
Grandmother's dead.

587
01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:30.438
"The victory
which You have obtained for us..."

588
01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.815
and for all who sleep in Him,

589
01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:36.486
keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship...

590
01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.571
with all that wait for Thee on earth,

591
01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:41.407
and with all that are
around Thee in heaven,

592
01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.785
in union with Him who
is the resurrection...

593
01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.580
and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost,

594
01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:50.750
"ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

595
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.210
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

596
01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.255
He does.

597
01:09:24.576 --> 01:09:26.369
"Almighty God, who by the death of-"

598
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.010
Have you ever been to a funeral?

599
01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:33.167
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

600
01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:35.460
but there weren't any funerals.

601
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.048
That one there to there.

602
01:09:43.303 --> 01:09:45.095
They both died at the same time?

603
01:09:46.139 --> 01:09:47.347
What of?

604
01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.017
I don't know.

605
01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:52.978
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

606
01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.356
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

607
01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:59.234
We didn't see them again.

608
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.823
This is fun.

609
01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.369
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

610
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:16.835
- That one there to there.
- This one?

611
01:10:18.922 --> 01:10:20.630
- This one?
- No, that one.

612
01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.510
- This one to here?
- No, there!

613
01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:26.721
- To here?
- No.

614
01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.014
- Here?
- No.

615
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:41.526
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

616
01:11:09.806 --> 01:11:11.890
You can't behave like this!

617
01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:16.103
You're questioning my behavior?
It can't continue!

618
01:11:16.104 --> 01:11:18.981
I know.
I can't stand this anymore, Ralf.

619
01:11:18.982 --> 01:11:21.066
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

620
01:11:22.402 --> 01:11:24.278
Don't you think there will be questions?

621
01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.780
Questions?
Well, now, what does it say...

622
01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:30.576
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

623
01:11:30.577 --> 01:11:33.579
Work? Is that what you call it?
Pull yourself together, woman.

624
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.414
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

625
01:11:35.415 --> 01:11:39.460
Ignore the fact that
the man I married is a monster!

626
01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.753
Even your own mother couldn't love you.

627
01:11:51.848 --> 01:11:53.598
Are you happy here?

628
01:11:55.018 --> 01:11:56.768
Yes. Very.

629
01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.606
And you, Gretel?

630
01:12:03.443 --> 01:12:09.114
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

631
01:12:09.616 --> 01:12:14.452
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

632
01:12:15.622 --> 01:12:18.289
No. Not anymore, really.

633
01:12:30.053 --> 01:12:35.557
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

634
01:12:36.977 --> 01:12:39.353
would you prefer to live somewhere else?

635
01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:43.231
Back home?
No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

636
01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:49.362
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

637
01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:52.282
All of us? You as well?

638
01:12:53.493 --> 01:12:56.829
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

639
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:59.414
I must stay and complete my work here.

640
01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:05.503
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it-

641
01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:12.011
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

642
01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:13.845
Would you like that?

643
01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:29.403
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

644
01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:32.198
The important thing is
your mother does not feel...

645
01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:35.117
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

646
01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:38.871
and the more I think about it, the more
I realize she's very probably right.

647
01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:40.580
- But, Dad-
- No!

648
01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.714
It's time for you to move away.

649
01:14:14.908 --> 01:14:16.866
Is everything all right?

650
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.789
We can't find Papa.

651
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.500
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

652
01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:26.543
and they haven't come back.

653
01:14:35.762 --> 01:14:39.430
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

654
01:14:41.184 --> 01:14:43.101
How long for this time?

655
01:14:43.603 --> 01:14:47.105
That's why it's bad.
It's forever, I think.

656
01:14:48.191 --> 01:14:52.527
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

657
01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:56.197
When do you go?
Tomorrow. After lunch.

658
01:14:57.325 --> 01:15:02.120
So, I won't ever see you again?

659
01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:08.169
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

660
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.588
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

661
01:15:16.219 --> 01:15:18.678
I wish I could've helped you find your dad.

662
01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:23.309
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

663
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:26.353
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

664
01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:29.189
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

665
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:37.489
I could dig under.
What? With that?

666
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:41.159
No, but I could bring something.
You don't want to come over here.

667
01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:46.331
Look.

668
01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:56.342
I could come through to your side.
What's the point in that?

669
01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.177
Your dad's not going to
be over here, is he?

670
01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:03.849
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

671
01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.809
I don't look like you.

672
01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:11.607
You could look like me, though.

673
01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:14.026
If you dressed like me and
shaved your hair off.

674
01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:16.195
I'm not shaving my hair off.

675
01:16:16.196 --> 01:16:20.699
You could cover it with a cap.
My pajamas are a different color.

676
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.328
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

677
01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:27.164
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

678
01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:29.667
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

679
01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:32.211
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

680
01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:35.714
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

681
01:16:35.715 --> 01:16:37.882
And don't forget the pajamas!

682
01:17:40.905 --> 01:17:42.071
Bruno?

683
01:17:42.782 --> 01:17:46.617
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

684
01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.747
- Bruno-
- It's my last chance.

685
01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:54.792
All right. Go on then.

686
01:18:26.117 --> 01:18:30.454
I thought you weren't coming!
I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

687
01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:34.123
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pajamas!

688
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.128
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

689
01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:42.673
Oh.

690
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:05.238
Shmuel.

691
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.164
Here.

692
01:19:30.723 --> 01:19:31.723
How do I look?

693
01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.732
Right. Let's get going.

694
01:19:58.042 --> 01:19:59.208
Bruno?

695
01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:02.086
That's enough.

696
01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.118
Let's go and find your dad.

697
01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.083
Come on!

698
01:20:41.586 --> 01:20:43.169
Master Bruno?

699
01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.173
Shmuel.

700
01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.843
Can we go to the café or something?
Café?

701
01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:39.642
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

702
01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:50.319
Yeah.

703
01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:56.033
We'll check our hut first.

704
01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.247
Bruno?

705
01:22:08.673 --> 01:22:10.172
Come on.

706
01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:24.021
Papa?

707
01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:28.942
Up! Up! Get up!

708
01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:31.069
What's happening?
I don't know.

709
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:32.904
We go on marches sometimes.

710
01:22:32.905 --> 01:22:34.905
Move! Up, up!

711
01:22:37.076 --> 01:22:38.868
Move, move!

712
01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:51.255
Bruno!

713
01:22:52.216 --> 01:22:54.383
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

714
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.775
Bruno!

715
01:23:13.529 --> 01:23:14.779
Bruno?

716
01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.460
Move!
Quickly!

717
01:23:31.422 --> 01:23:32.797
Get up!

718
01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.134
Get up. You must!

719
01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:39.762
Move them out!

720
01:23:51.442 --> 01:23:53.777
...which means that
our weekly capabilities...

721
01:23:53.778 --> 01:23:55.362
would be almost tripled,

722
01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.698
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer-

723
01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.825
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

724
01:24:01.452 --> 01:24:02.493
Bruno's missing.

725
01:24:08.793 --> 01:24:10.126
Come on!

726
01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:18.467
Wait here!

727
01:24:29.313 --> 01:24:30.646
Come on!

728
01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:34.859
Move! Move!

729
01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:44.493
Join the queue!

730
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:54.129
Come on, you!

731
01:25:03.222 --> 01:25:04.764
Bruno!

732
01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.057
Move it!

733
01:25:09.729 --> 01:25:11.228
Go on.

734
01:25:12.815 --> 01:25:14.399
Bruno!

735
01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:28.914
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

736
01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:30.373
Clothes off!

737
01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.466
Where are we going?

738
01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:46.639
No, it's just a shower.

739
01:25:48.434 --> 01:25:50.309
A shower?

740
01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:01.111
Herr Kommandant!

741
01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:41.652
Open the gates! Open the gates!

742
01:26:45.324 --> 01:26:46.448
Move!

743
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:30.034
Move!

744
01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.404
Bruno!

745
01:28:39.585 --> 01:28:42.085
