A radio signal
from another world.

Let's not jump
the gun here.

31
00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.633
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know--

32
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:40.261
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

33
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.804
Wait, this can't be right.

34
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:48.144
The calculated distance from source
is only 375,000 kilometers.

35
00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.357
It's coming from the moon.

SETI in New Mexico
identified a signal.

39
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:14.337
But, uh, they're even more
confused than we are, sir.

40
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.589
Excuse me.

41
00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.261
-Major!
-Yes, sir.

42
00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:26.683
Radar reception has been impaired
but we were able to get these.

43
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:31.229
We estimate that it has a diameter
of over 550 kilometers

44
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.274
and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

46

-A meteor?
-No, sir.

47
00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.114
-No, definitely not.
-How do you know?

48
00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.491
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

49
00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.743
-It's what?
-It's, uh...

50
00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.745
It's slowing down, sir.

51
00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.298
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

52
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.300
Then wake him!

-MARILYN (over phone): Hi.

55
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.308
-It's me.
-Hi.

56
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.393
What time is it there?

57
00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.980
It's 2:45 in the morning.
I know I didn't wake you.

58
00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:15.690
As a matter of fact, you did.

59
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:17.150
Liar.

60
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.070
I have a confession to make.

61
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:25.783
I'm sleeping next
to a beautiful, young brunette.

62
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:29.787
You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV? Did you?

63
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.247
Of course not.

64
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.832
You're coming home
after the luncheon?

65
00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.167
Yes, yes.

66
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.669
-Mommy?
-Here's your mother.

67
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.923
Hi, honey!

68
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.592
Hi, I miss you.

69
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.178
-I know! I miss you too...
-President Whitmore's approval ratings

70
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.472
have slipped below 40 percent.

71
00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:49.766
-Even his crime bill failed to pass.
-He's good.

72
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.685
Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?

73
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.271
-Morton.
-Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War

74
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.982
is completely different
from leadership in politics.

75
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.026
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

76
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.986
Traitor.

77
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.655
That's the problem.
They elected a warrior and got a wimp.

78
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.449
Morning, George.

79
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.117
Morning, Mr. President.

80
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.828
That game couldn't
have been pretty.

81
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.455
Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.167
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.

83
00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.839
They're not attacking your policies,
they're attacking your age.

84
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.093
Addressing Congress:
"Whitmore seems less like the president

85
00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.054
"and more like the orphaned child Oliver

86
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.182
asking, 'Please, sir,
I'd like some more.'"

87
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:32.600
That's clever.

88
00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:33.935
Well, I'm not laughing.

89
00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:36.813
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

90
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.148
You were thought of
as young, idealistic...

91
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.567
-Thanks.
-Now the message has gotten lost.

92
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.113
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

93
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:49.534
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

94
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.414
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the Secretary of Defense.

95
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.376
Yes.

96
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:04.298
Could you say that again?

97
00:07:34.078 --> 00:07:36.456
MALE DEEJAY (on radio): You're listening
to WXBY out here in Brooklyn.

98
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.459
Temperature is 95 degrees
in Central Park.

99
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.419
What it is here in the
borough, God only knows.

100
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:42.962
Let's go to Nick Jones

101
00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:44.881
and give us a traffic report
for the beaches

102
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.299
in case anybody's not
out there already.

103
00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:48.843
So why are
you waiting, hm?

104
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:51.304
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

105
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.139
I'm thinking.

106
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.016
Yeah, well, think already!

107
00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:06.110
Do you have any idea how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

108
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.988
If you don't move soon,
I'm gonna start to decompose.

109
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.448
Ah...

110
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.746
Listen, David, I've been
meaning to talk with you.

111
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.917
It's nice that you
see me so much now...

112
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.585
Don't start, Dad.

113
00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.087
I'm only saying
it's been what? Four years?

114
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.672
You're still wearing
a wedding band?

115
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:28.591
-Three years.
-All right, three, four.

116
00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.385
You're divorced, move on.
This is not healthy.

117
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.013
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

118
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.937
Checkmate.

119
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.563
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

120
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.941
Wait a minute.
This is not checkmate.

121
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.734
See you tomorrow, Pop.

122
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.361
Just hold on!
This is not checkmate.

123
00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.533
Oh, checkmate!

124
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.369
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

125
00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.622
Yeah, I love X-Files, too.
I hope you get to see it.

126
00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.417
David! David!

127
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.170
What the hell's the point of having
a beeper if you don't turn it on?

128
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.880
It was turned on.
I was ignoring you.

129
00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.924
What's the...
What's the big emergency?

130
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:11.467
It started this morning.

131
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.178
Every station's making
like it's the 1950s.

132
00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.889
We got static, we got snow,
all kinds of distortions.

133
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.683
-Marty.
-Nobody knows...

134
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:21.352
What the hell you doin'? There's a reason
we have bins labeled "Recycle"!

135
00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:24.272
What the hell is going on?
My God in heaven!

136
00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:27.400
So sue me. David!
We got a problem!

137
00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.485
Did you switch
transponder channels?

138
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.195
Oh, please!

139
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.614
You think I'd be this panicked
if it was something simple?

140
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:36.492
Okay, let's point
the dish at another satellite.

141
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.286
We tried that. It didn't work.

142
00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.913
It's almost as though
they weren't even there.

143
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.915
All right.
What have we got here?

144
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.506
This is impossible.

145
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.509
We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...

146
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.012
TROY:
The signal's all screwed up.

147
00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.140
Stop it! Just
leave it alone. You'll break it!

148
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:01.392
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

149
00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:07.732
(truck horn blares)

150
00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.611
Oh, no.

151
00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.866
Good morning, Lucas.

152
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:20.911
You see these? I got
a whole goddamn crop full of these.

153
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.414
If your father's
not in the air in 20 minutes...

154
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.751
I'm getting someone else.

155
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.177
Russell!

156
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.137
Hey, Miguel!

157
00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.223
(laughs)

158
00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:42.933
Agh!

159
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.145
Whoo!

160
00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.525
Ya-hoo!

161
00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:54.070
Russell!
What are you doing?

162
00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:11.712
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

163
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.798
Whoa!

164
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.635
It's the wrong field,
you idiot!

165
00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:20.304
Lucas's farm's
on the other side of town!

166
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.393
Are you sure?

167
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.693
(speaking in Spanish)

168
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:06.142
CNS is running a story
that we're covering up

169
00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.685
some kind of
nuclear-testing experiment.

170
00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:08.978
Tell 'em to run with it

171
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.646
if they want
to embarrass themselves.

172
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.399
NASA's been on my butt all morning.
They wanna know our position.

173
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.986
Our official position is

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.735
Yeah.

346
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.946
I'm one of 'em.

347
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.659
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

348
00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:14.703
He's just trying
to impress you.

349
00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:17.706
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job

350
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.125
and stop slobbering
all over my shoes.

351
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.009

honking in distance)

352
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.685
I don't believe this.
Jasmine!

00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:40.604
Neighbors are moving out.

354
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:43.482
I guess they finally got
tired of all these quakes.

355
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.068
A little shake
and they running.

MALE NEWS REPORTER:
Police and fire departments

357
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.114
are asking everyone
to stay off the phone.

358
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:53.783
There's something on the news
about the quake!

359
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.830
-What's up, man?
-Hey, Steve.

360
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:01.666
-What you doing going out there?
-Shooting aliens.

361
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.544
Oh, you shooting aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?

362
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:06.630
What you got? Turn around.

363
00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:09.466
Come on, let's get
you something to eat.

364
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:13.261
Watch out!
Watch it now!

365
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.764
-I'm gonna go grab the paper.
-All right.

MARTY: I know, Ma.
Just try and stay calm.

Tell her to pack up

David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

David! David, talk to me.

385
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.052
Didn't you hear me tell you that
the signal hidden in the satellite feed

386
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.138
is slowly recycling down
to extinction?

387
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.098
-Not really.
-Countdown.

388
00:26:40.181 --> 00:26:43.435
A countdown?
A countdown to what, David?

389
00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.771
It's like in chess.

390
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:48.732
First you strategically
position your pieces.

391
00:26:48.815 --> 00:26:53.069
Then, when the timing's right,
you strike. See?

392
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:55.864
They're positioning themselves
all over the world

393
00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:58.617
using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

394
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.286
In approximately six hours,
the signal's gonna disappear

395
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.912
and the countdown's
gonna be over.

396
00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:04.623
And then what?

397
00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.543
Checkmate.

Oh, my God,
I gotta call my brother.

401
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:17.927
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!

402
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:19.763
Ah, forget my lawyer.

403
00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:23.308
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

404
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:25.393
Good afternoon.

405
00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.562
My fellow Americans,

406
00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:31.483
a historic and unprecedented
event has occurred.

407
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:34.194
The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe

408
00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:36.196
has been answered.

409
00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.198
Although it's understandable

410
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.700
that many of us feel a sense of
hesitation or even fear,

411
00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.662
we must attempt
to reserve judgment.

412
00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:46.081
(whispers)
He says he's your husband.

413
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.250
Oh, God.

414
00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:54.381
-What do you want?
-You gotta leave the White House.

415
00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:57.759
This is hardly the time nor the place
to be having that same old discussion.

416
00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.552
You don't understand.
You gotta leave Washington.

417
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:03.306
In case you haven't noticed, we are having
a little bit of a crisis here!

418
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.059
Honey, they're communicating with
a hidden signal. They're gonna attack.

419
00:28:06.142 --> 00:28:09.396
-You are just being paranoid!
-It's not paranoia!

420
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:11.606
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked.

421
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.899

422
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.738

424
00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:22.450
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

425
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.452
-Please?
-Okay.

426
00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.913
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: The staff and I
will remain in the White House,

427
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:29.040
as we attempt
to establish communication.

428
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.751
If you feel compelled
to leave these cities,

429
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.212
please do so
in an orderly fashion.

I'm not gonna do this
with you, Jasmine.

I've got to report
to El Toro.

440
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.115
You said you
was on leave for the Fourth!

441
00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:03.658
Yeah, well,
they canceled it!

442
00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.997
Look, why are you
acting like this?

443
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.540
Why?

444
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.461
That's why!

(helicopter passing)

446
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:26.848
Look, I really
don't think

447
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:30.310
they flew 90 billion light years
to come and start a fight.

448
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.354
And get all rowdy.

449
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.398
Look, why don't you
just relax?

450
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:38.401
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's going on.

451
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:44.741
What are you
doing in there, man?

452
00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:47.327
Nothing, I'm just driving.

453
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.745
Look.

Hey, I got
these for you.

455
00:29:50.747 --> 00:29:52.373
-Firecrackers!
-You be careful.

456
00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:53.958
Steve, wait.

457
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:57.128
-I wanna tell you something.
-What is it, Jasmine?

458
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:02.717
You take care of yourself,
you hear?

459
00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:07.764
Look, um...

460
00:30:07.847 --> 00:30:09.682
Why don't you get
some things, packed,

461
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:12.227
and you and Dylan come
stay with me on the base?

462
00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:16.689
You will see that there
is nothing to be scared of.

463
00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:19.025
Really?

464
00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:20.693
You don't mind?

465
00:30:20.777 --> 00:30:23.154
Well, I mean...

466
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.698
I will have to let
all my other girlfriends know

467
00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.701
they can't come over. I got
to postpone a freaky weekend.

468
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:32.288
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

469
00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:35.708
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

470
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.710
Yes, I am.

471
00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:40.380
Them big old Dumbo ears.

472
00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:42.590
Look at you
with them chicken legs.

473
00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.676
(clucks)

474
00:30:50.807 --> 00:30:52.851
Come on, Dylan.

Look out!

478
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.658
Hey! Whoa!

479
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:11.661
The television said they
started the looting. Vultures.

480
00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:13.496
Do you still have the Plymouth?

481
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.332
You wanna borrow the car?
David, you don't have a license.

482
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:17.750
You're driving.

483
00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:19.335
Yeah, I'm driv--
I'm driving?

484
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:20.837
Come on, come on!

485
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.049
I really want you
out of Los Angeles.

486
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:27.719
You're staying there to keep people calm.
It's the right thing to do.

487
00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:30.013
I'm not going to let them
criticize you for it.

488
00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:31.764
I appreciate
your trying to help me.

489
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.851
Liar. Stick to the truth.
It's what you're good at.

490
00:31:34.934 --> 00:31:37.562
Alright. I'll tell you the truth. I don't
want you in any one of those cities.

491
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.022
(sighs)

492
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.065
I'll leave as soon
as the interviews are done.

493
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:43.359
All right. There's a
helicopter waiting.

494
00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:45.153
They're going to
take you to Nellis.

495
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.655
-And the munchkin?
-She's gonna meet you there.

496
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.742
All right.
I love you.

497
00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:52.744
I love you.

498
00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:55.830
-Bye.
-Bye.

499
00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:02.253
JULIUS: It's the White House!
For crying out loud.

500
00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:04.047
You can't just drive up
and ring a bell.

501
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.548
Can't this go any faster?

502
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.467
You think they
don't know what you know?

503
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.761
They know! Believe me, they know.
She works for the president.

504
00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:12.555
-They know everything.
-They don't know this.

505
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:15.975
You're gonna educate them, huh?
Tell me something, huh, you're so smart?

506
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:19.187
How come you spent eight years in MIT
to become a cable repairman?

507
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.146
Dad...

508
00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:22.440
All I'm saying is they got
people who handle these things.

509
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:24.734
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

510
00:32:24.817 --> 00:32:27.445
Look at these
people, look. Huh?

511
00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:29.405
Vultures.
They take and then they go.

512
00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:32.909
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!

513
00:32:32.992 --> 00:32:35.703
-They're cutting me off.
-No one's cutting you off!

514
00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.747
They're getting in front of me.
I can't go any faster.

515
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.209
All right! I don't wanna argue. Let's just
get there as quickly as possible.

516
00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.377
What's the rush, huh?

517
00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.587
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

518
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.758
A local crop-duster
was arrested today

519
00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:50.551
as he papered City Hall
with leaflets from the air.

520
00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.261
Everybody's leaving.

521
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:54.555
Can you give us some of your time?
You want to make a statement?

522
00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.932
We've got to stop them!

523
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.393
I was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!

524
00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.603
They did all kinds of
experiments on me!

525
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:03.731
They've been studying us for years,
finding out our weaknesses!

526
00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:07.110
We've gotta stop 'em!
They're gonna kill us all!

527
00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.821
Some people attribute
his eccentric behavior

528
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:11.531
to post-traumatic
stress syndrome

529
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:13.741
from his service
as a pilot in Vietnam.

530
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:16.369
Others, however,
have a more unusual theory.

531
00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:18.287
How would you describe
Mr. Casse?

532
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:20.915
-Keeps to himself. Real quiet.
-Private.

533
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.543
When they took him up
in the spaceship,

534
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:28.673
the aliens abused him sexually.

535
00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:30.717
REPORTER: Mr. Casse is in
the county lockup this evening.

536
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.802
Pack up. We're leaving.

537
00:33:32.885 --> 00:33:34.387
Given extenuating circumstances,

538
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.889
he may be released
later tonight...

539
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:39.225
Miguel, what about Dad?

540
00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.186
This could be our
last night on Earth.

541
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:46.774
You don't wanna die
a virgin, do you?

542
00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.611
-Come on! We're going.
-No, I'm not going anywhere.

543
00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.113
Miguel!

544
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.823
Stop it!

545
00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:58.578
Thanks a lot, partner!
Remember!

546
00:33:58.661 --> 00:34:01.748
Get as far away
from these things as you can!

547
00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:06.794
You read my mind!

548
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:09.422
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

549
00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:12.717
-They let you out?
-You damn right!

550
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.803
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

551
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:17.638
Come on, boy!

552
00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:19.724
The L.A.P.D. is asking
Los Angelinos

553
00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:22.602
not to fire their guns
at the visitor spacecraft.

554
00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:26.147
You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.

555
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.940
You think we can find
something better to do

556
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:29.442
with our time, gentlemen?

557
00:34:29.525 --> 00:34:31.277
Where you been, Stevie?

558
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.738
Man, this is unbelievable.
This is, like, huge.

559
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:35.740
They've recalled everybody.

560
00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:38.493
Looks like the mail's
still working.

561
00:34:39.827 --> 00:34:42.038
Oh! Oh, oh.

562
00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:45.249
Uh... You'll have to do
the honors for me, man.

563
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:48.628
-You're a wuss.
-Whatever. Shut up and read it.

564
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:52.173
It says,
"Captain Steven Hiller"--

565
00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.257
loser.

566
00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.009
-Come on, come on!
-United States Marine Corps,

567
00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:57.053
blah, blah, blah, blah...

568
00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:59.055
"We regret to
inform you that

569
00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:01.974
despite your
excellent record of service--""

570
00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:05.770
I'm sorry, man.

571
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:08.731
You know what
you need to do?

572
00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:10.900
You need to, like,
kiss some serious booty

573
00:35:10.983 --> 00:35:12.527
to get ahead in this world.

574
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.737
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

575
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:16.781
See, I like the
one-knee approach

576
00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:18.366
because it
puts the booty,

577
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.868
like, right in front
of the lip--

578
00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.412
-What's this?
-That's nothing.

579
00:35:23.496 --> 00:35:24.831
What is this?

580
00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:28.167
Jasmine kind of has
a thing for dolphins.

581
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:31.087
Stevie, this is
a wedding ring.

582
00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:38.553
I thought you said you were gonna
break the whole thing off?

583
00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:40.429
(sighs) Yes.

584
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:47.520
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.
You know that, right?

585
00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:52.692
Man, you're never gonna get to fly
the space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

586
00:35:54.443 --> 00:35:56.320
(dance music
playing over speakers)

587
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:02.743
MALE REPORTER (on TV): It Could Only
Happen in California File,

588
00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.288
Here's Wendy Walsh
with a special report.

589
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:08.749
WENDY WALSH: Below us, we can see
hundreds of UFO fanatics

590
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.835
who have gathered on rooftops
here in downtown Los Angeles

591
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:12.962
to welcome the new arrivals.

592
00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:15.590
Oh, God! I hope
they bring back Elvis!

593
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:19.760
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

594
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.762
Oh, I must have been tripping.

595
00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.182
FEMALE REPORTER: It's being called
the party event of the century!

596
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:26.726
and everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.

597
00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:29.604
-This is so cool!
-Girl, please!

598
00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:33.608
Oh, hey! I made it
before I came in tonight.

599
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:36.861
Check it out.

600
00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:39.322
Now, I know you're not thinking
about joining those idiots.

601
00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:42.575
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

602
00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:45.661
-Do you wanna come?
-Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

603
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:48.247
I've got a really
bad feeling about this.

604
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:49.624
I don't want you to go.

605
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.168
-Now promise me you won't.
-Oh!

606
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:54.420
Come on, girl!
Promise me.

607
00:36:55.838 --> 00:36:57.381
I promise.

608
00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:59.508
Okay.

609
00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:02.303
Look. I'm out of
town for a while.

610
00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.680
-Later.
-Bye.

611
00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:08.601
(car horns blaring)

612
00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:12.688
Everyone in the world is trying
to get out of Washington.

613
00:37:12.772 --> 00:37:14.941
We're the only schmucks
trying to get in.

614
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:17.318
MALE REPORTER (on radio): ...establish
some line of communication.

615
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.028
What the hell is that?

616
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.198
Pops, this is every
phone book in America.

617
00:37:22.281 --> 00:37:24.742
You think an important person
like Constance is gonna be listed?

618
00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:28.371
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

619
00:37:28.454 --> 00:37:31.749
Demonstrators in front of the White House
are protesting the military involvement

620
00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:34.377
with our first contact
with the alien visitors.

621
00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.212
(people clamoring)

622
00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:38.756
(indistinct radio chatter)

623
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.722
So...?

624
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:49.141
Do you wanna
ring the bell, or should I?

625
00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:50.893
(busy tone beeping)

626
00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:52.728
Oh, perfect, she's using it.

627
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:54.730
What? It's busy?

628
00:37:54.814 --> 00:38:00.278
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

629
00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.822
-You can do that?
-Yeah.

630
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:05.741
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

631
00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:09.412
Visitors have arrived, but the president
remat the White House.

632
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:12.164
Question.
Are Mr. Whitmore's actions:

633
00:38:12.248 --> 00:38:14.333
A, ultra brave,

634
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:17.169
-or B, foolhardy?
-(phone rings)

635
00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:19.755
-What?
-DAVID: Don't hang up, sweetie.

636
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:22.091
(whispering)
David! How did you get this number?

637
00:38:22.174 --> 00:38:24.677
DAVID: Do me a favor.
Walk to the window.

638
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.595
And I'm looking for what?

639
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.556
You'll see.

640
00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.641
Over here.

641
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.685
(overlapping chatter)

642
00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:33.811
See us?

643
00:38:33.894 --> 00:38:36.480
How does he do that?

644
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.701
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors,

645
00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:52.079
Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter

646
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.582
with a type of visual
communications device.

647
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:58.753
-Mr. President.
-Gentlemen, be seated.

648
00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:01.714
-Where are we now?
-We're just commencing liftoff.

649
00:39:01.797 --> 00:39:04.717
...and refitted with these
enormous light panels

650
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.428
that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

651
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.722
MALE PILOT: Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.

652
00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:12.183
I repeat, Welcome Wagon
is in the air.

653
00:39:12.266 --> 00:39:15.519
-Roger, Welcome Wagon.
-Echo One, right beside you.

654
00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:18.314
This is something I would never
believe in my lifetime that I would be.

655
00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:20.858
In the White House!
Look at this!

656
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:22.985
If I knew I was gonna
meet the president,

657
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:24.278
I would have worn a tie.

658
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.405
Look at me,
I look like a schlemiel.

659
00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:28.407
You look fine, Pops.

660
00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:30.034
Oy, my God!

661
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:32.328
David, I don't know how happy
he's gonna be to see you.

662
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:34.872
Then we're wasting time, he's
not going to listen to me, we should go.

663
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:36.374
Why wouldn't he listen?

664
00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:38.751
Last time I saw him,
we got into a fight.

665
00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.878
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

666
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:43.381
-You punched the president?
-He wasn't president then.

667
00:39:43.464 --> 00:39:46.050
I punched him, he fought back.
We wrestled around, it was a fight!

668
00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:48.177
A fight that
you started!

669
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.179
David thought
I was having an affair.

670
00:39:50.262 --> 00:39:52.181
-With the president?
-Which, of course, I wasn't!

671
00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:54.725
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

672
00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:56.102
All right, I'll get him.

673
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:57.895
You wait here, and don't
touch anything!

674
00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:00.689
You punched the president?

675
00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:02.066
God!

676
00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:12.118
Nearing point of contact,
Echo One.

677
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:14.078
We're closing in.

678
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:16.580
MALE CONTROLLER: Roger that.
Commence sequence when ready.

679
00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:18.749
The three choppers
are steadily approaching

680
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.210
what has been
unanimously agreed

681
00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:23.087
to be the front
of these spaceships,

682
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.631
a parabolic indentation
nine city blocks...

683
00:40:25.714 --> 00:40:27.633
You're leaving now?

684
00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:30.344
See if they've got
those pens that they give away.

685
00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.470
Dad, what?

686
00:40:31.554 --> 00:40:34.640
I don't have a choice...

687
00:40:34.723 --> 00:40:37.643
-I don't have time for this.
-Two minutes, Tom, please.

688
00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:39.562
Mr. President,
Julius Levinson.

689
00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.105
David is my son.

690
00:40:41.188 --> 00:40:43.732
-I told you he wouldn't listen.
-You have to tell him now.

691
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.444
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

692
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.991
Uh, I know why we have
satellite disruption.

693
00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:56.036
All right. Go ahead.

694
00:40:57.538 --> 00:40:58.747
Okay.

695
00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:02.585
Let's say that you wanted to
coordinate with spaceships

696
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:04.753
on different sides
of the Earth.

697
00:41:04.837 --> 00:41:06.672
They couldn't send
a direct signal, right?

698
00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:10.843
-You're talking about line of sight?
-Yeah, that's right exactly.

699
00:41:10.926 --> 00:41:12.595
The curve of the
Earth prevents it.

700
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:16.724
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

701
00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:20.728
Well, I found a signal
hidden inside

702
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.147
our own satellite system.

703
00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:28.527
Excuse me, Mr. President.
They're starting.

704
00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:33.866
They're using our
own satellites against us.

705
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:38.954
The clock is ticking.

706
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:45.127
Bringing it in to hover.

707
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:48.255
Welcome Wagon, Echo One.
Approaching alien ship.

708
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.092
Initiating communication
sequence, Echo One.

709
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.138
Welcome Wagon
has commenced.

710
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:04.480
General Grey, coordinate
with the Atlantic Command.

711
00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:06.815
Tell them to evacuate as many people
out of the cities as they can.

712
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.150
Yes, sir.

713
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.027
Get those helicopters
away from the ship.

714
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.695
Call them back immediately!

715
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:13.697
-What the hell's going on?
-We're leaving.

716
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.032
Kim! My daughter.

717
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.911
Uh... There's something
happening here.

718
00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.792
They're responding.

719
00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.627
-Something's opening.
-Something is happening.

720
00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:31.465
It looks like there's
some kind of activity here.

721
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.300
This may be a response,
Echo One.

722
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.553
MAN: We see it, too.
Can't identify it.

723
00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:48.732
GREY:
We are evacuating.

724
00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:51.193
I repeat, we are evacuating
the White House.

725
00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:56.198
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

726
00:42:58.117 --> 00:43:01.120
-Is my wife in the air?
-She will be shortly.

727
00:43:01.203 --> 00:43:02.746
Nice. Very nice.

728
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.082
-Good! Close the door!
-Hatch secure!

729
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:07.835
We have our own phone.

730
00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.464
Move out of here.

731
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:17.469
The president's ordered an evacuation.
We have to leave now.

732
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:20.973
And our prayers go out to the wives
and children of those brave pilots.

733
00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:23.475
-Indeed, God help us all.
-Mrs. Whitmore.

734
00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:25.769
The visitors responded
with terrifying...

735
00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:27.730
MALE REPORTER (on radio):
Authorities have called

736
00:43:27.813 --> 00:43:29.815
for a complete evacuation
of Los Angeles County.

737
00:43:29.898 --> 00:43:33.360
People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.

738
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.529
Oh, yeah, great!
Now he tells me.

739
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.663
MALE OFFICER (on speaker):
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

740
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:47.207
Please vacate
the premises immediately

741
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.335
for your own safety.

742
00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:52.087
(crowd clamoring)

743
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:08.562
-Can we move it along?
-Dr. Katz's office.

744
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:10.606
Hello. Let me speak
to Dr. Katz, please.

745
00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:13.108
-I'm sorry, he's not available.
-Listen, for $300 an hour,

746
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.902
you can put me through to his house
in the Hamptons!

747
00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:26.372
MALE OFFICER (on speaker):
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

748
00:44:26.455 --> 00:44:28.415
Please vacate
the premises immediately

749
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.167
for your own safety.

750
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.797
Mrs. Whitmore!

751
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.882
You must leave now.

752
00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:44.932
MAN: The First Lady's secured.
We're on the move.

753
00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:57.528
They're opening up!

754
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.908
♪ ♪

755
00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:11.083
It's so pretty.

756
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:39.778
Get the hell out of here!

757
00:45:53.375 --> 00:45:55.711
Go ahead, pilot. We're ready
to take off right now.

758
00:45:55.794 --> 00:45:57.045
Right away, sir.

759
00:45:57.129 --> 00:45:58.881
Can we get a blanket
for Patricia?

760
00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:04.136
Here.

761
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:20.527
Time's up.

762
00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:15.749
(all clamoring)

763
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:18.544
(woman screaming)

764
00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:26.134
Oh, crap.

765
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:53.871
(car alarm blares)

766
00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:05.734
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan!
We gotta go!

767
00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:08.779
-Come on, Boomer!
-(BOOMER barks)

768
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:19.873
(DYLAN screaming)

769
00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:49.403
Boomer!

770
00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.199
Boomer!

771
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:24.146
Reports are unclear as to
the extent of the devastation,

772
00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:26.565
but from all accounts,
Los Angeles, Washington,

773
00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:28.025
and New York
have been left in ruins.

774
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:30.485
Good God!

775
00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:32.029
I've been saying it.

776
00:50:32.112 --> 00:50:34.156
I've been saying it for
ten damn years!

777
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:35.407
Ain't I been sayin' it, Miguel?

778
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:38.827
Huh? I've been saying it!

779
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.455
Dad, I'm sick.
I don't feel good.

780
00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.914
Pull it over, man.

781
00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:55.052
-We're gonna be all right, Troy.
-Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

782
00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:01.266
Miguel!

783
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:03.435
Look at all that.

784
00:51:25.874 --> 00:51:28.919
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

785
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.508
That's the advantage
of being a fighter pilot.

786
00:51:35.884 --> 00:51:38.303
In the Gulf War,
we knew what we had to do.

787
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:43.391
This is just...

788
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:45.811
not simple any more.

789
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:48.897
A lot of people
died today.

790
00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:55.946
How many didn't have to?

791
00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:00.575
Any news on my wife yet?

792
00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:04.871
The helicopter
never made it to Nellis.

793
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.376
No radio contact.

794
00:52:16.007 --> 00:52:18.135
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

795
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:29.855
Here it is.

796
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.798
What happened, Mommy?

797
00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:00.802
I don't know, baby.

798
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:03.805
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

799
00:53:03.889 --> 00:53:05.891
Our target is to the north,

800
00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:09.436
centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

801
00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.521
Our Black Knight
Squadron...

802
00:53:11.605 --> 00:53:13.899
-Are you scared, man?
-Nope.

803
00:53:15.483 --> 00:53:17.485
-You?
-Nope.

804
00:53:20.071 --> 00:53:24.034
-Hold me!
-Hey, hey, pay attention.

805
00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:26.286
Something you wanna add to
this briefing, Captain Hiller?

806
00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:29.915
No, sir. Just a little anxious to get up
there and whoop ET's ass, that's all.

807
00:53:29.998 --> 00:53:31.583
(laughter)

808
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.835
You'll get your chance.

809
00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:36.338
You'll all get
your chance.

810
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.173
Good hunting.

811
00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:39.925
Dismissed!

812
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:43.511
Let's kick the tires and light
the fires, Big Daddy.

813
00:53:43.595 --> 00:53:46.848
MAN:
Ready to go, sir!

814
00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:48.141
Let's bring it home.

815
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:49.726
Bring that bad
boy home, Captain!

816
00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:51.811
-You loose?
-Yes, sir!

817
00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:56.733
-Got your victory dance?
-Oh, I got it right here, yeah!

818
00:53:56.816 --> 00:53:58.443
Hey, don't get pre-patrol
on me, soldier.

819
00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:00.737
We don't light up
till the fat lady sings.

820
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.530
I'm all ears, brother!

821
00:54:11.373 --> 00:54:12.791
You the man!

822
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:20.006
All right, gentlemen, we're on.

823
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.716
General, it's NORAD.

824
00:54:23.385 --> 00:54:24.928
General Grey here.

825
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.221
Al?

826
00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:29.057
All satellite, microwave, and ground
communications with the cities are down.

827
00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.392
All systems gone.

828
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:32.727
For intelligence, we believe
we're looking at a total loss.

829
00:54:32.811 --> 00:54:35.397
How about our boys?
Where are they?

830
00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.066
ETA to target,
four minutes.

831
00:54:46.241 --> 00:54:48.076
I shouldn't have left her.

832
00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:49.953
Don't worry
about it, big man.

833
00:54:50.036 --> 00:54:53.206
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

834
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.626
Or, as the good
reverend would say,

835
00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:01.756
"Why we're on this particular mission,
we'll never know.

836
00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.009
"But I do know, here today

837
00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:07.429
that the Black Knights will
emerge victorious once again."

838
00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:10.724
-Amen, man!
-Amen, Reverend.

839
00:55:24.696 --> 00:55:26.448
Holy God.

840
00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:31.828
Lock and load!

841
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:36.499
Roger that.
Los Angeles attack squadron

842
00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:38.626
has Amraam missiles
locked on target.

843
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:41.296
Washington and New York
squadrons reporting lock-on.

844
00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:42.756
Fire at will.

845
00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.716
-Fire at will.
-Fire at will.

846
00:55:46.384 --> 00:55:50.347
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

847
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.766
Knight Three, fox three!

848
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:54.142
Knight Seven, fox three.

849
00:55:56.436 --> 00:55:58.396
Missiles have been fired.

850
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.294
-Are they not getting through?
-No, sir, not one.

851
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.631
Command, Knight One. Switching
to Sidewinders, moving in.

852
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:31.221
Knight Three, Love 50.
Notch reference 1-2-0.

853
00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:34.724
Knight Seven, 120.

854
00:56:34.808 --> 00:56:37.268
Knight One, sweep lock.
Fox Two.

855
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:38.853
Knight Seven,
Fox Two.

856
00:56:43.274 --> 00:56:44.359
Come on, come on!

857
00:56:50.365 --> 00:56:52.784
They must have some kind of
protective shield over that hull!

858
00:56:52.867 --> 00:56:54.536
Knights, pull up! Pull up!

859
00:56:59.499 --> 00:57:00.625
Knight Three, pull up!

860
00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:02.752
Controls are showing
complete failure in the stats!

861
00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:04.587
Pull up!

862
00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:05.922
Agh!

863
00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:15.098
Blow through, blow through!

864
00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:17.767
Too many of 'em!

865
00:57:19.394 --> 00:57:21.104
They got another one, sir.

866
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:27.527
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

867
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:32.532
I got you covered,
Big Daddy.

868
00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:37.579
Damn, they got shields too!

869
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.009
Let's go, Knights!
Move, Knights! Move!

870
00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.847
(pilot screams)

871
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.265
Jesus!

872
00:57:57.348 --> 00:57:59.434
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

873
00:57:59.517 --> 00:58:01.769
-They're dropping like flies.
-We're losing them.

874
00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:03.980
All right,
get 'em out of there.

875
00:58:04.063 --> 00:58:05.982
Squadron leaders,
retreat to fallback position.

876
00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:07.650
Abort mission!
Abort mission right away!

877
00:58:07.734 --> 00:58:08.943
Do you read me?
Do you copy?

878
00:58:12.238 --> 00:58:14.574
We're gonna have to make
a run for this one!

879
00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.075
Let's get low and fast!

880
00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.952
I gotcha, Big Daddy!
Let's get 'em!

881
00:58:18.036 --> 00:58:20.455
JIMMY: Whoo!

882
00:58:20.538 --> 00:58:21.581
Watch the deck!

883
00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:31.925
Squadron leader, abort! Abort!

884
00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.843
This isn't happening
fast enough!

885
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:35.094
Get 'em out of there!

886
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.770
The monitor!
Where's the picture?

887
00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:45.438
We've lost the satellite.

888
00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:51.778
STEVEN: We got two
on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!

889
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:52.904
Roger.

890
00:58:54.322 --> 00:58:57.784
Come on, come on!
Move, move, move!

891
00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.577
He's on me like white
on rice, Big Daddy.

892
00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:02.455
They ain't got nothing
for us! Let's push it!

893
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:04.249
I can't shake 'em.
I can't shake 'em.

894
00:59:04.332 --> 00:59:06.793
Yes, you can. Just the way
I showed you. Let's go!

895
00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:09.420
-I'm gonna try something.
-Don't do nothing stupid over there!

896
00:59:09.504 --> 00:59:11.130
-You know me!
-That's what I'm talkin' about!

897
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.799
Aah!

898
00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:15.510
Jimmy, you can't bank
at that speed!

899
00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:18.805
-Jimmy, he's closing on you!
-(gasping)

900
00:59:20.014 --> 00:59:21.391
Put your mask back on!

901
00:59:21.474 --> 00:59:23.518
-That's an order, Marine!
-I can't breathe!

902
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:27.272
Jimmy!

903
00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:29.065
Jimmy!

904
00:59:30.984 --> 00:59:32.527
Jimmy, no!

905
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:34.737
Affirmative.
We have incoming.

906
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:37.240
-Let me have it, son.
-You got it.

907
00:59:37.323 --> 00:59:39.534
Friendly?

908
00:59:39.617 --> 00:59:40.743
Sergeant?

909
00:59:40.827 --> 00:59:42.912
I don't think so.

910
00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:46.749
(air-raid siren blaring)

911
00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:49.294
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here!

912
01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:11.858
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!

913
01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.615
What are you shooting at?

914
01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.451
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

915
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.915
You can't hit nothing!

916
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.132
(STEVE grunts emphatically)

917
01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.101
Whoa! Low bridge!

918
01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.145
Whoo!

919
01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:54.776
See if you can fly
that thing under cover!

920
01:00:57.862 --> 01:00:59.864
Ha-ha! Hope you got an airbag!

921
01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:05.078
Whoo!

922
01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.391
(grunts)

923
01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.935
(gasping and grunting)

924
01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.853
Aah!

925
01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:39.654
Son of a bitch.

926
01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.533
Aah!

927
01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:45.451
That's right!
That's right!

928
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.370
Get off! Get off of me!

929
01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.539
That's what you'll get!
Ha-ha!

930
01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:50.915
Look at you!

931
01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:54.210
Ship all banged up!
Who's the man?

932
01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:57.255
Huh? Who's the man?
Wait till I get another plane!

933
01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:59.841
I'm lining all your friends up,
right beside you!

934
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.262
Where you at? Huh?
Where you at?

935
01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.151
Welcome to Earth.

936
01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:31.372
That's what
I call a close encounter.

937
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.040
(BOOMER panting)

938
01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.838
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

939
01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.725
Keys. Come on, keys.

940
01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:51.976
Yes!

941
01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:54.687
Come, baby, come on.
Come on!

942
01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.856
-(engine starts)
-Yes!

943
01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.150
Reports indicate
that this battle

944
01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:01.068
has repeated itself
all over the world

945
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.987
with the exact same results.

946
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.990
See, Troy? You're feeling
better already.

947
01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:09.744
Everybody's packing up.
They're leaving.

948
01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.662
They said there's a spaceship
headed this way.

949
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.415
We'd better leave too,
don't ya think?

950
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.881
(groaning)

951
01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.718
It's Air Force One,
for crying out loud.

952
01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.720
Still he gets sick.

953
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.556
-I don't feel so good.
-Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

954
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.767
Could be bad weather
or good weather. Doesn't matter.

955
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.685
We could go up,
we could go down.

956
01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.646
We could go back,
we could go forward,

957
01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.856
we could go
side to side and...

958
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.733
(groaning)

959
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.693
What did I say?

960
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:47.156
-He still gets airsick, huh?
-Yeah.

961
01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.160
Julius, with all
of this, I, uh...

962
01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.371
I didn't get a chance
to thank you two.

963
01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:56.958
All he could think of
was getting to you.

964
01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:02.296
There's still love there, I think.

965
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.551
Love was never a problem.

966
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.804
All you need is love.

967
01:04:09.887 --> 01:04:11.848
John Lennon.
Smart man.

968
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.016
Shot in the back, very sad.

969
01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.478
GREY: We've moved
as many of our forces

970
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.689
away from our bases
as possible.

971
01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:21.482
But we've already
sustained heavy losses.

972
01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.485
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

973
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.320
They agree we must
launch a counteroffensive

974
01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:27.780
with a full nuclear strike.

975
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.490
Over American soil?

976
01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.367
You're saying at this
point, we should sacrifice

977
01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:34.495
more innocent American
civilians? Is that right?

978
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.373
Sir, if we don't strike soon, there may
not be much of an America left to defend!

979
01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:39.458
Sir!
They've taken out NORAD.

980
01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.794
-What?
-It's gone, sir.

981
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.796
My God.

982
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.007
The vice president?
The joint chiefs?

983
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.634
Mr. President.

984
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.219
We must launch.

985
01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.680
A delay now
would be more costly

986
01:04:52.763 --> 01:04:54.807
than when you waited
to evacuate the cities.

987
01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.601
You're not gonna launch
nuclear weapons.

988
01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:59.645
You'll kill them and us at the same time.
If we fire nukes--

989
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.440
Sir, may I remind you,
you are a guest here?

990
01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:04.275
You ever hear
of nuclear winter?

991
01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.985
It's the end of life
as we know it.

992
01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.528
CONSTANCE: Just go.

993
01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.488
I don't have to go.
It can't be allowed!

994
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.073
Shut up! Captain, get him out of here!

995
01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.700
Hey, don't tell him to shut up!

996
01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:17.288
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!

997
01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:19.415
None of you did anything
to prevent this!

998
01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:20.875
There was nothing
we could do.

999
01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:23.336
We were totally
unprepared for this.

1000
01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.796
-Don't give me unprepared!
-Come on, Julius.

1001
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.758
It was, what? In the 1950s,
you had that spaceship.

1002
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.718
DAVID:
Dad. Look, Dad...

1003
01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:33.220
JULIUS: Yeah, that thing
you found in New Mexico!

1004
01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:35.556
-Where was that?
-No, not the spaceship.

1005
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.099
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico.

1006
01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.518
No, you had the spaceship
and the bodies!

1007
01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.812
-Come on.
-They were locked up in a bunker.

1008
01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.064
Where was that?

1009
01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:44.690
Area 51. Right?

1010
01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:48.069
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.

1011
01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.697
Sir...

1012
01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.617
Regardless of what you may
have read in the tabloids,

1013
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.786
there have never been
any spacecraft

1014
01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.579
recovered by our government.

1015
01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.207
Take my word for it.
There's no Area 51. Psh...

1016
01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.459
And there's
no recovered spaceship.

1017
01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:06.462
NIMZIKI: Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President...

1018
01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:10.591
That's not entirely accurate.

1019
01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:17.640
What? Which part?

1020
01:06:22.895 --> 01:06:24.897
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

1021
01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:28.901
Sorry.

1022
01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:49.922
JASMINE:
Can you give me a hand?

1023
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.882
MAN: Yeah, sure.

1024
01:06:58.472 --> 01:06:59.765
Oh, God...

1025
01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:06.814
(BOOMER barks)

1026
01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:09.066
Okay, okay,
let's get this off.

1027
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.193
Here, let me help you.

1028
01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:16.282
She's hurt
pretty badly.

1029
01:07:20.494 --> 01:07:23.914
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

1030
01:07:24.915 --> 01:07:26.792
But, no!

1031
01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.377
You got me out here,

1032
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:31.922
dragging your heavy ass
through the burning desert

1033
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.508
with your dreadlocks sticking
out the back of my parachute.

1034
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:37.762
You gotta come down here
with an attitude,

1035
01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.847
acting all big and bad.

1036
01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:45.019
And what the hell
is that smell?

1037
01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.896
Arrrrgh!

1038
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.357
I could've been at
a barbecue!

1039
01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.277
But I ain't mad.

1040
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.906
It's all right,
it's all right.

1041
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.214
Hey!

1042
01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:16.217
Hey! Hey...

1043
01:08:21.722 --> 01:08:22.807
Hey!

1044
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.780
Do you need a lift,
soldier?

1045
01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:41.033
When I flew overhead, I saw
a base not too far from here.

1046
01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.704
It ain't on the map.

1047
01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:48.624
Trust me, it's there.

1048
01:09:04.181 --> 01:09:05.683
Attention!

1049
01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.689
Mr. President. General.

1050
01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:14.650
Welcome to Area 51.
Please follow me.

1051
01:09:16.193 --> 01:09:18.821
We're now 24 floors
beneath the surface

1052
01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.740
and, uh, here's our
main research facility.

1053
01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:23.784
Let's see it.

1054
01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.203
Sorry, sir, it's a clean room.
It's static free.

1055
01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.581
Open the door.

1056
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.584
Yes, sir.

1057
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.815
WHITMORE: My God.

1058
01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.817
Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

1059
01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:01.030
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

1060
01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:10.372
WHITMORE: I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

1061
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.292
How do you get funding
for something like this?

1062
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:16.003
You don't actually think they spend
$20,000 on a hammer,

1063
01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:18.714
$30,000 on a
toilet seat, do you?

1064
01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:23.135
Mr. President,
this is Dr. Okun.

1065
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.012
He's been heading up
the research department

1066
01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:27.097
on this project
the last 15 years.

1067
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.226
How do you do?

1068
01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:33.437
(gasps)
Mr. President!

1069
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.481
Wow!

1070
01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.690
Uh... This--

1071
01:10:36.774 --> 01:10:39.360
What a pleasure, heh.

1072
01:10:39.443 --> 01:10:41.028
As you can imagine, they...

1073
01:10:41.111 --> 01:10:42.988
They don't let us out much.

1074
01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.867
I can understand that.
(clears throat)

1075
01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:49.411
Well...

1076
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:53.415
I guess you'd like to see
the big tamale, huh?

1077
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:54.875
Follow me.

1078
01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:10.766
♪ ♪

1079
01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:47.886
She's a beaut, ain't she?

1080
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.141
As you can see
from the repairs,

1081
01:11:52.224 --> 01:11:55.644
we've been trying to put her
back together since the late 1960s.

1082
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.689
Don't tell me you've had this for 40 years
and you know anything about 'em?

1083
01:11:58.772 --> 01:12:00.024
Oh, hell, no.

1084
01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.401
No, no, no, no.
We know tons about 'em.

1085
01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.279
But the neatest stuff...

1086
01:12:05.362 --> 01:12:07.323
The neatest stuff has only
happened in the last few days.

1087
01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:10.784
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

1088
01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.120
so we've never been
able to experiment.

1089
01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:15.789
But since these guys
started showing up,

1090
01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.375
all the little gizmos
inside turned on.

1091
01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.920
Heh. The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!

1092
01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.590
Exciting?
People are dying out there.

1093
01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.217
I don't think exciting is the word
I'd choose to describe it!

1094
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.847
You guys are hoping
to fly this thing, huh?

1095
01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.058
You said you can repair
their technology.

1096
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.809
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1097
01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:38.395
Oh, yeah.
Well, I mean...

1098
01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:41.523
They're not all
that dissimilar from us.

1099
01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.943
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1100
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.863
Probably why
they're interested in our planet.

1101
01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.657
Hey...

1102
01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.201
Hey.

1103
01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.204
You guys wanna see 'em?

1104
01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:58.290
Huh?

1105
01:13:05.339 --> 01:13:06.840
Uh, this is...

1106
01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.468
This is the vault.

1107
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.762
Or, as some of us
have come to call it...

1108
01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.848
the freak show.
(snickering)

1109
01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:39.081
When we found 'em,

1110
01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:42.709
they were wearing some
sort of biomechanical suits.

1111
01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:44.378
Once we got 'em off,

1112
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:46.088
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

1113
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:50.467
Eyes, ears,
no vocal chords.

1114
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:51.885
We're assuming
they communicate

1115
01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.929
with each other
through some other means.

1116
01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:55.806
You're obviously
not thinking

1117
01:13:55.889 --> 01:13:58.267
about hand signals
and body language.

1118
01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:00.269
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception.

1119
01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:02.855
Telepathy.

1120
01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:03.981
So...

1121
01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:08.402
It's an organic life form.

1122
01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:13.365
Can they be killed?

1123
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.659
Their bodies are just
as frail as ours.

1124
01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:18.078
These two died
in the crash.

1125
01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.122
This one a
few weeks later.

1126
01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:24.168
You just have to get through
their technology, which is...

1127
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.337
I'm sorry to say,
far more advanced.

1128
01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:32.092
David, you unlocked part
of their technology.

1129
01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.386
-You cracked the code.
-No, no.

1130
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.805
All I did was stumble
on their, um,

1131
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:40.017
signal. I don't know
how, uh, helpful I can be.

1132
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.312
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

1133
01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.858
Figure out what
they haven't thought of yet.

1134
01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:52.654
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1135
01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.874
What code?

1136
01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.522
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1137
01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.607
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.

1138
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.901
I can't let you pass
without clearance.

1139
01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.986
Okay. Come here.

1140
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.905
You wanna see
my clearance?

1141
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:38.200
(gasps)

1142
01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:40.786
Maybe I'll just
leave this here with you.

1143
01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.329
Let 'em pass.

1144
01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:44.915
-Let 'em pass!
-Get the hell out of the way!

1145
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.043
Did you see that?

1146
01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.965
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

1147
01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.803
How long has
it been unconscious?

1148
01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:00.055
-About three hours.
-Let's get him in containment stat.

1149
01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:03.642
GREY: As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

1150
01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:06.019
When were you planning on
informing the rest of us?

1151
01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.771
It had been deemed classified.

1152
01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:11.191
You should have told us about this
when they first arrived.

1153
01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.860
You should have warned us before
we launched a counterattack

1154
01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:16.613
that cost the lives
of hundreds of American pilots!

1155
01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.615
There's no way we could have known
that our fighters

1156
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.784
would have been
that ineffective against their attackers!

1157
01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:22.077
Mr. President.

1158
01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.914
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

1159
01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:29.418
Atlanta, Chicago,
and Philadelphia.

1160
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:31.336
Destroyed.

1161
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.797
NATO and Western
Allied installations

1162
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.799
were the first
to be taken out.

1163
01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:37.676
Then we were hit.

1164
01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.429
They knew exactly
where and how to hit us.

1165
01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:42.681
-And our forces?
-We're down to 15 percent.

1166
01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.559
If you calculate
the time it takes

1167
01:16:45.642 --> 01:16:47.769
to destroy a city
and move on,

1168
01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:52.733
we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city

1169
01:16:52.816 --> 01:16:56.194
in the next 36 hours.

1170
01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:59.281
We're being exterminated.

1171
01:17:03.243 --> 01:17:04.911
MITCHELL:
Mr. President!

1172
01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.456
This is Captain
Steven Hiller.

1173
01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:08.707
-Captain.
-Mr. President.

1174
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.167
Well done.

1175
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.085
Where is it now?

1176
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:14.796
We have it isolated down
in the containment lab, sir.

1177
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.757
I'd like to go see it.

1178
01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:25.766
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1179
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.437
Hasn't anyone told you?

1180
01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.651
El Toro has been
completely destroyed.

1181
01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:38.612
♪ ♪

1182
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.740
(sighs)

1183
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.619
No.

1184
01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.164
-We were lucky.
-Yeah.

1185
01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:33.709
Today was the first time
I used the subway.

1186
01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.794
Thank God
for the Metro Rail.

1187
01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.505
These should
last us a while.

1188
01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:40.757
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

1189
01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.761
He's your son?

1190
01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:46.555
He's my angel.

1191
01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:49.975
Was his father
stationed here?

1192
01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.185
No, he, uh...

1193
01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.229
He wasn't his father.

1194
01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:58.150
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

1195
01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.406
So what do you do for a living?

1196
01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:05.824
I'm a dancer.

1197
01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:08.660
Oh... Ballet?

1198
01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.747
No. Exotic.

1199
01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:16.168
Oh. Sorry.

1200
01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:18.670
Don't be. I'm not.

1201
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:23.341
It's good money. Besides,

-Hi.

Well, I didn't
want to say nothing.

Pick there. Good.

01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:12.693
What are you saying?

1377
01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:15.530
We can't stop
the bleeding.

1378
01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:17.698
If we'd...

1379
01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:19.825
There's nothing
we can do for her.

1380
01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.455
We were worried. We didn't
know where you were.

1381
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.879
MARILYN: You've gotten
bigger, I think.

1382
01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.798
I did?

1383
01:32:36.008 --> 01:32:39.011
You just keep growing
and growing.

1384
01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.098
I can't...

1385
01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.393
Hey.

1386
01:32:45.476 --> 01:32:48.187
Can you, uh, wait outside
for a little bit

1387
01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.855
so Mom can get a rest?

1388
01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:51.607
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1389
01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.870
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1390
01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:06.455
Oh...

1391
01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:09.041
It's okay.

1392
01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:12.795
The doctors...

1393
01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:18.759
think that you're
gonna be just fine.

1394
01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:23.014
Liar.

1395
01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:21.322
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1396
01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.784
Yeah.

1397
01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.245
Mommy's sleeping.

1398
01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:33.292
Hey.

1399
01:35:01.612 --> 01:35:02.780
(metallic crashing)

1400
01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:05.700
David!

1401
01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.786
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm making a mess!

1402
01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:10.705
Yeah. This I can see.

1403
01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:13.374
We gotta burn resources,
and dump toxic waste,

1404
01:35:13.457 --> 01:35:15.668
pollute the air
and rip up the ozone!

1405
01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:19.338
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough,

1406
01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:21.424
they won't want it anymore.

1407
01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:23.384
Wait, wait, wait.
David, David.

1408
01:35:23.467 --> 01:35:26.178
Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
Are you listening to me?

1409
01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:27.596
I'm listening.

1410
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.765
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1411
01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:32.059
David! Even myself.

1412
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.230
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1413
01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.946
You see, sometimes,

1414
01:35:44.029 --> 01:35:46.198
we have to remember
what we still have.

1415
01:35:47.658 --> 01:35:49.160
Like what?

1416
01:35:51.954 --> 01:35:56.375
Well, you still have
your health.

1417
01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.836
Come on, David, David,
you need your rest.

1418
01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:01.213
Come on! Get off
of this freezing concrete floor

1419
01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:02.840
before you catch a cold.
Come on!

1420
01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:08.387
-What did you just say?
-You mean about faith?

1421
01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.848
Well, you see, a man...

1422
01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:12.725
No, no, no.
No, the other part.

1423
01:36:12.808 --> 01:36:15.895
What? What? I don't want
you to catch a cold.

1424
01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:20.941
Dahhh!

1425
01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:23.652
What is that? What's
the matter with you?

1426
01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:25.571
Genius.

1427
01:36:25.654 --> 01:36:27.072
Genius?

1428
01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:29.617
My dad. A total genius.

1429
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:34.288
Jerry, wake up.
We got work to do.

1430
01:36:34.371 --> 01:36:35.748
Get everybody
down here right away.

1431
01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.292
What?

1432
01:36:40.503 --> 01:36:41.962
Look at that!

1433
01:36:42.046 --> 01:36:45.466
DYLAN: Wow! Does that thing
really fly in outer space?

1434
01:36:45.549 --> 01:36:48.844
-It most certainly does.
-Sure doesn't look like it.

1435
01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:51.305
They're here.

1436
01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:52.765
All right, Connie,
what's this all about?

1437
01:36:52.848 --> 01:36:54.016
I have no idea.

1438
01:36:54.099 --> 01:36:55.601
Get everybody off.

1439
01:36:55.684 --> 01:36:59.230
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1440
01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:00.439
Major Mitchell.

1441
01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:02.399
-Do you have a pistol?
-What?

1442
01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:05.361
-Have you got a gun?
-Sergeant, your sidearm.

1443
01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:09.824
See that, uh, Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1444
01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:12.201
Think you can shoot
that thing off?

1445
01:37:12.284 --> 01:37:14.078
Do it. Shoot it.

1446
01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:15.788
Sir?

1447
01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:17.164
Go ahead.

1448
01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:23.045
(all clamoring)

1449
01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.214
What the hell
are you doing?!

1450
01:37:25.297 --> 01:37:27.466
I'm sorry.
My fault, my fault.

1451
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.803
You see, that Coke can was
protected by the craft's shield.

1452
01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:32.179
We can't penetrate their defenses.

1453
01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:33.639
We know that already.
What's your point?

1454
01:37:33.722 --> 01:37:36.141
My point is, if we can't
beat their defenses,

1455
01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:38.185
then we gotta get
around 'em.

1456
01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:42.481
Major. One more
time... Any time.

1457
01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:55.911
-How did you do that?
-I gave it a cold.

1458
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:01.333
I gave it a virus.
A computer virus.

1459
01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.711
GREY: Are you telling us
you can send out a signal

1460
01:38:03.794 --> 01:38:05.838
that will disable
all their shields?

1461
01:38:05.921 --> 01:38:08.841
That's right. Just like they
used our satellites against us,

1462
01:38:08.924 --> 01:38:11.635
we can use their
own signal against them.

1463
01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.471
If we plant a virus
into that mother ship,

1464
01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.265
it's gonna filter down
into all

1465
01:38:16.348 --> 01:38:18.183
the corresponding
ships below.

1466
01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:20.185
NIMZIKI: I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1467
01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:24.565
How exactly do we
infect the mother ship with this virus?

1468
01:38:25.941 --> 01:38:28.402
We're...
We're gonna, uh,

1469
01:38:28.485 --> 01:38:31.280
have to, um,
fly their alien craft

1470
01:38:31.363 --> 01:38:33.032
out of our atmosphere
and dock with it.

1471
01:38:33.115 --> 01:38:37.077
We can enter here, as shown
in these satellite photos.

1472
01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:40.539
We then upload the virus, we then
set off some kind of explosion,

1473
01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:41.999
which will disable it.

1474
01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:43.834
And that'll disorient
the smaller ships below

1475
01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:48.589
and that could buy you,
I think at least some time to, uh,

1476
01:38:48.672 --> 01:38:51.634
to take them, take them out.
Take them down.

1477
01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:54.345
Do your... Do your stuff.

1478
01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:56.722
This is ridiculous!

1479
01:38:56.805 --> 01:38:59.183
How long would
their shields be down?

1480
01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:02.394
Uh, I don't know.
A matter of minutes.

1481
01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:05.731
You want us to coordinate a massive
worldwide counterstrike

1482
01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:07.816
with a window
of only a few minutes?

1483
01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.027
With shields down,
it might be possible.

1484
01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.570
Oh, please!

1485
01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:13.739
We don't have the manpower
or the resources

1486
01:39:13.822 --> 01:39:15.449
to launch that kind
of a campaign!

1487
01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:17.910
Not to mention that
this whole cockamamie plan

1488
01:39:17.993 --> 01:39:20.454
is dependent on a machine
that no one in this world

1489
01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:22.373
is qualified to operate.

1490
01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.583
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1491
01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:26.126
I've seen these things
in action.

1492
01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:29.213
I'm well aware of their
maneuvering capabilities.

1493
01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:33.676
With your permission, General,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1494
01:39:33.759 --> 01:39:35.928
That thing is a wreck.

1495
01:39:36.011 --> 01:39:38.138
It crash-landed back
in the '50s.

1496
01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:40.724
We don't even know
if it's capable of flying!

1497
01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.935
Jim, uh,
remove the clamps.

1498
01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:44.436
(computer keys clacking)

1499
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.314
♪ ♪

1500
01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.084
Any questions?

1501
01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:13.799
Let's do it.

1502
01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:18.929
MAJOR MITCHELL: All right,
you heard the president...

1503
01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:22.641
-Good luck, pilot.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

1504
01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:25.060
A virus.

1505
01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:27.104
Your idea.

1506
01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:29.231
That's right.

1507
01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.948
Do you really think
you can fly that thing?

1508
01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:41.660
Do you really think you can do
all that bullshit you just said?

1509
01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.169
Whoo.

1510
01:40:50.252 --> 01:40:52.713
I understand you are
upset over the death of your wife.

1511
01:40:52.796 --> 01:40:55.716
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1512
01:40:55.799 --> 01:40:57.509
No, the only mistake
I ever made

1513
01:40:57.593 --> 01:40:59.178
was to appoint
a sniveling little weasel

1514
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:00.596
like you as
Secretary of Defense.

1515
01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:03.557
-I don't think you understand!
-However,

1516
01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.684
that is one mistake
I am thankful to say

1517
01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:07.227
that I don't have
to live with.

1518
01:41:07.311 --> 01:41:10.856
-Mr. President--
-Mr. Nimziki, you're fired.

1519
01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:16.487
Let's organize every plane
we can find

1520
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.697
and get us some goddamn
pilots to fly 'em.

1521
01:41:18.781 --> 01:41:20.074
Yes, sir.

1522
01:41:20.157 --> 01:41:21.700
He can't do that.

1523
01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:24.787
Well, he just, uh, did.

1524
01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.085
Command has attempted to compile
a list of casualties and losses,

1525
01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:32.920
but information
is sketchy is best.

1526
01:41:33.003 --> 01:41:35.839
We know we've lost the Belgian
contingent in the Sinai.

1527
01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.467
There's a strong possibility
there may be more reinforcements

1528
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:40.135
hiding in the Golan Straits.

(speaks Arabic)

1530
01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:44.765
What the hell's
he saying?

1531
01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:47.226
It seems they're getting
a signal. Old Morse code.

1532
01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:57.820
-(speaks Arabic)
-(Morse code beeping)

1533
01:42:00.072 --> 01:42:02.241
It's from the Americans.

1534
01:42:03.742 --> 01:42:05.911
They want to organize
a counteroffensive!

1535
01:42:05.994 --> 01:42:09.039
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1536
01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:16.922
They claim to be able
to bring down their shields.

1537
01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:20.884
When do they want to attack?

1538
01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.970
(Morse code beeping)

1539
01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:29.643
The attack begins in 5 hours.

1540
01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:34.731
GREY: We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

1541
01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:36.733
in Europe, the
Middle East, and Asia.

1542
01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.820
That's impressive. Considering
it's all being done with...

1543
01:42:39.903 --> 01:42:41.738
GREY:
Morse code.

1544
01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:43.323
The armed forces here?

1545
01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:45.534
We have sufficient aircraft
for the battle plan, but...

1546
01:42:45.617 --> 01:42:48.745
-But what?
-Pilots are coming up short.

1547
01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.831
Well, then, find 'em.

1548
01:42:50.914 --> 01:42:53.250
Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan

1549
01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.669
trade rumors of military
forces in hiding

1550
01:42:55.752 --> 01:43:00.716
unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

1551
01:43:00.799 --> 01:43:03.218
What we're planning at this time is
to launch a counteroffensive.

1552
01:43:03.302 --> 01:43:05.179
However, with our
depleted manpower,

1553
01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:08.724
we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1554
01:43:08.807 --> 01:43:10.392
Military training
is preferable,

1555
01:43:10.475 --> 01:43:12.603
but anyone who can fly
a plane would be useful.

1556
01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:17.149
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1557
01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:21.695
MAN: All right, guys!
Listen up!

1558
01:43:21.778 --> 01:43:24.072
MITCHELL: Pay attention.
These F-18s are very different

1559
01:43:24.156 --> 01:43:25.616
than the jets
you piloted before.

1560
01:43:25.699 --> 01:43:27.784
-It's kinda strong.
-Forgive the expression,

1561
01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.746
but you're about to get a crash
course in modern avionics.

1562
01:43:30.829 --> 01:43:33.624
-Keep it coming.
-Okay, you got it!

1563
01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:36.210
All right, listen up. Before we begin,
we're gonna have to get

1564
01:43:36.293 --> 01:43:39.338
a little background information
on your flight experience.

1565
01:43:39.421 --> 01:43:41.548
Let's start with you.

1566
01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:42.799
Who, me?

1567
01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.426
Yeah.

1568
01:43:44.509 --> 01:43:46.845
Well, I'm, uh,
Russell Casse, sir.

1569
01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:52.935
And, uh, after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1570
01:43:53.018 --> 01:43:56.146
And, uh, been doing
that ever since.

1571
01:43:56.230 --> 01:44:01.151
On a personal note,
sir, I'd just like to add that, uh,

1572
01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:05.197
ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,

1573
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.324
I have been dying
for some payback.

1574
01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:11.536
I just want you to know that,
uh, I won't let you down.

1575
01:44:13.330 --> 01:44:15.290
GREY: You have one tactical
nuclear missile,

1576
01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:18.752
we're loading into this launcher
we're installing under the right wing.

1577
01:44:18.835 --> 01:44:20.754
This is the firing mechanism.

1578
01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:23.632
It'll be attached to
the ship's main console.

1579
01:44:23.715 --> 01:44:25.759
Just like the Amraam
launch pad on a Stealth.

1580
01:44:25.842 --> 01:44:29.596
Except the nuke will
not detonate at impact.

1581
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.517
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1582
01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.061
Good luck, gentlemen.

1583
01:44:36.144 --> 01:44:37.729
30 seconds.

1584
01:44:37.813 --> 01:44:40.107
It's the strongest radio
transmitter we could get.

1585
01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:41.900
It'll tell us when you've
uploaded the virus.

1586
01:44:41.984 --> 01:44:44.945
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it a little too close?

1587
01:44:45.028 --> 01:44:46.989
We're gonna be well
on our way back home

1588
01:44:47.072 --> 01:44:48.865
before we shoot
that thing off.

1589
01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.828
Why you? David!

1590
01:44:52.911 --> 01:44:55.622
I don't...
I don't understand,

1591
01:44:55.706 --> 01:44:59.418
why you can't show someone else
how to plant the virus.

1592
01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:01.336
No, no. Something
may go wrong.

1593
01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.298
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1594
01:45:04.381 --> 01:45:06.008
Who knows?

1595
01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:09.428
Hey, you know how I'm always
trying to save the planet?

1596
01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:14.850
Here's my chance.

1597
01:45:17.394 --> 01:45:19.396
Now he gets ambitious.

1598
01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:21.231
DYLAN:
It's too tight.

1599
01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:22.816
Well, I had
to borrow it. Let me see.

1600
01:45:22.899 --> 01:45:25.736
Okay. All right,
I guess that's good enough.

1601
01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:28.739
So. How do I look?

1602
01:45:28.822 --> 01:45:31.825
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.

1603
01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:36.955
-You're late!
-Well, you know me.

1604
01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:38.874
I know. You like to make
a big entrance.

1605
01:45:38.957 --> 01:45:40.667
Here, let me help you.

1606
01:45:40.751 --> 01:45:44.463
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1607
01:45:44.546 --> 01:45:47.132
Sorry for what, babe?

1608
01:45:47.215 --> 01:45:50.427
I should have done this
a long time ago.

1609
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.636
Do you have the ring?

1610
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.930
Uh, yes, sir.

1611
01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:55.974
Here, make yourself useful.

1612
01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:56.933
Ow!

1613
01:45:59.436 --> 01:46:00.479
Witnesses?

1614
01:46:00.562 --> 01:46:02.147
-Um...
-Um...

1615
01:46:03.398 --> 01:46:04.983
We got hung up.

1616
01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:07.736
CHAPLAIN: Well, let's get
this show on the road.

1617
01:46:07.819 --> 01:46:11.698
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here
in the sight of God

1618
01:46:11.782 --> 01:46:14.659
and in the presence
of these witnesses

1619
01:46:14.743 --> 01:46:17.704
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1620
01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.790
Any person who can
show good cause

1621
01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.708
why these two
should not wed,

1622
01:46:21.792 --> 01:46:25.295
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1623
01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:32.010
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife

1624
01:46:32.094 --> 01:46:35.472
to live together with her in
the holy state of matrimony?

1625
01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:38.725
Will you love her,
comfort her, honor,

1626
01:46:38.809 --> 01:46:40.352
and keep her in
sickness and in health,

1627
01:46:40.435 --> 01:46:42.729
and, forsaking all others,

1628
01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:46.733
keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1629
01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:50.153
I will.

1630
01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.738
Whoo!

1631
01:47:00.789 --> 01:47:02.791
Good morning.

1632
01:47:06.378 --> 01:47:09.005
They're a little young.

1633
01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:11.174
That they are.

1634
01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:14.803
They look a little nervous.

1635
01:47:14.886 --> 01:47:16.179
I need all flight crews

1636
01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:19.683
to report to their
designated areas immediately.

1637
01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:22.436
-Major. Can I borrow that?
-Sir.

1638
01:47:24.187 --> 01:47:25.981
Good morning.

1639
01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:29.693
(amplified)
Good morning.

1640
01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.864
In less than an hour,

1641
01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:38.743
aircraft from here will join
others from around the world.

1642
01:47:38.827 --> 01:47:41.580
And you will be launching
the largest aerial battle

1643
01:47:41.663 --> 01:47:44.458
in the history of mankind.

1644
01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:47.502
Mankind.

1645
01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:51.047
That word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1646
01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:56.052
We can't be consumed by our
petty differences any more.

1647
01:47:57.804 --> 01:48:01.475
We will be united
in our common interest.

1648
01:48:01.558 --> 01:48:07.105
Perhaps it's fate that
today is the Fourth of July.

1649
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:11.276
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1650
01:48:11.359 --> 01:48:14.613
Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.

1651
01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:20.076
But from annihilation.

1652
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.579
We're fighting
for our right to live.

1653
01:48:24.247 --> 01:48:26.708
To exist.

1654
01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:29.711
And should we win the day,

1655
01:48:29.794 --> 01:48:32.464
the Fourth of July will
no longer be known

1656
01:48:32.547 --> 01:48:35.133
as an American holiday,

1657
01:48:35.217 --> 01:48:38.345
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

1658
01:48:38.428 --> 01:48:40.889
"We will not go quietly
into the night!"

1659
01:48:40.972 --> 01:48:45.602
"We will not vanish
without a fight!"

1660
01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:48.188
"We're going to live on!"

1661
01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:51.024
"We're going to survive!"

1662
01:48:51.107 --> 01:48:55.278
Today, we celebrate
our Independence Day!

1663
01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:58.114
(cheering)

1664
01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:00.742
Yeah!

1665
01:49:20.136 --> 01:49:21.513
Let's go!

1666
01:49:21.596 --> 01:49:23.348
MITCHELL: Mr. President.
Right this way, sir.

1667
01:49:23.431 --> 01:49:25.517
-I've got your gear over here.
-Good luck!

1668
01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.893
I've got a jumpsuit for you

1669
01:49:26.977 --> 01:49:29.145
and the rest of your gear is
squared away in this duffel.

1670
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.605
You've got your choice of helmets.

1671
01:49:32.566 --> 01:49:35.694
Mr. President, I'd sure like
to know what you're doing.

1672
01:49:35.777 --> 01:49:37.904
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1673
01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.492
I belong in the air.

1674
01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:50.584
Okay, sir.
Let's get you airborne.

1675
01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:52.043
Right over here.

1676
01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:57.007
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light

1677
01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.175
those fireworks, all right?

1678
01:50:05.807 --> 01:50:08.643
Here. Take these.

1679
01:50:11.813 --> 01:50:13.440
Just in case. Heh.

1680
01:50:13.523 --> 01:50:15.233
Where's...
Where's...

1681
01:50:26.077 --> 01:50:27.954
Just in case.

1682
01:50:30.415 --> 01:50:32.334
I'm very proud of you.

1683
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:46.348
Be careful, okay?

1684
01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:54.230
It's time.

1685
01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:00.945
I love you.

1686
01:51:01.029 --> 01:51:03.031
I love you.

1687
01:51:08.036 --> 01:51:10.705
Oh, damn! Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1688
01:51:10.789 --> 01:51:12.791
We gotta find some cigars.
I can't...

1689
01:51:12.874 --> 01:51:16.711
Here! Here! Take
these. My last two.

1690
01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:19.422
You are a lifesaver.

1691
01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.800
Almost put a hex on
the whole damn thing!

1692
01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:40.819
MALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Good morning, Dave.

1693
01:51:49.744 --> 01:51:51.871
-Missile launch.
-Oh, crap!

1694
01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:54.124
-What did I hit? Which one?
-(alarm blaring; powering up)

1695
01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.292
(alarm stops; powering down)

1696
01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:59.170
I picked a hell of a day
to quit drinking.

1697
01:52:08.179 --> 01:52:10.181
(alarm sounding)

1698
01:52:14.477 --> 01:52:16.813
This is our victory dance.

1699
01:52:16.896 --> 01:52:19.023
Not until the fat lady sings.

1700
01:52:19.107 --> 01:52:21.693
Oh. Yes, okay.

1701
01:52:21.776 --> 01:52:23.278
This is important.

1702
01:52:23.361 --> 01:52:25.822
Mmm. Fat lady. I gotcha.

1703
01:52:27.824 --> 01:52:29.826
MAN (over P.A.):
Open launch tunnel.

1704
01:52:49.387 --> 01:52:51.765
Shaky, huh? Is it gonna
do this the whole way?

1705
01:52:51.848 --> 01:52:53.516
Please make sure your seat backs
and tray tables

1706
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.226
are in their upright
and locked position.

1707
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:56.853
Yeah. Is it?

1708
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.775
Let's rock 'n' roll.

1709
01:53:04.277 --> 01:53:05.487
Oh!

1710
01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:09.783
Oops.

1711
01:53:09.866 --> 01:53:11.993
Oops?
What does that mean?

1712
01:53:12.076 --> 01:53:15.079
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing.

1713
01:53:15.163 --> 01:53:18.082
What do you mean,
saying "Oops" there?

1714
01:53:18.166 --> 01:53:21.044
What do you say we try
that one again, huh?

1715
01:53:21.127 --> 01:53:23.713
Yes, yes.
Yes, without the "Oops."

1716
01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:25.381
Thataway.

1717
01:53:28.426 --> 01:53:30.804
HILLER:
Whoa!

1718
01:53:30.887 --> 01:53:32.388
(DAVID shouting)

1719
01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.933
I have got to get me
one of these!

1720
01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:46.236
No, no. What was that?
Don't do that!

1721
01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:48.988
Just trying to get a feel
for the old girl, that's all.

1722
01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:50.698
No, no, don't.
Leave her alone.

1723
01:53:50.782 --> 01:53:52.742
-Look, no hands!
-Steve!

1724
01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:53.993
(laughs)

1725
01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.749
-You're all secure, sir.
-Grey, do you read me?

1726
01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:03.336
Roger, Eagle One. Your primary
target has shifted course.

1727
01:54:03.419 --> 01:54:06.214
-Which way they headed?
-I think our secret's out.

1728
01:54:06.297 --> 01:54:08.132
They're headed straight for us.

1729
01:54:08.216 --> 01:54:10.760
ETA, 26 minutes.

1730
01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:13.763
(groans)

1731
01:54:13.847 --> 01:54:15.723
You still with me
over there?

1732
01:54:15.807 --> 01:54:18.810
What the hell
was I thinking? Oh!

1733
01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:31.823
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

1734
01:54:43.334 --> 01:54:44.752
Head straight for it.

1735
01:54:51.259 --> 01:54:53.720
-What the hell?
-Don't touch them. Don't, don't!

1736
01:54:53.803 --> 01:54:55.555
I was counting on this.

1737
01:54:55.638 --> 01:54:58.600
They are bringing us in.

1738
01:54:58.683 --> 01:55:01.352
When the hell was
you gonna tell me?

1739
01:55:01.436 --> 01:55:02.645
Oops.

1740
01:55:04.647 --> 01:55:07.150
We've gonna have to work
on our communication.

1741
01:55:21.998 --> 01:55:24.208
We have visual.

1742
01:55:24.292 --> 01:55:28.004
Do not engage until we've confirmed
the package has been delivered.

1743
01:55:28.087 --> 01:55:29.047
Roger.

1744
01:55:34.135 --> 01:55:37.347
Major, what happens
if that thing gets here

1745
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.682
before the virus is planted?

1746
01:55:39.766 --> 01:55:42.352
Ma'am, this facility's buried
deep within a mountain.

1747
01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:44.187
It should provide us some protection.

1748
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:47.315
Great. What about
the people outside?

1749
01:55:55.198 --> 01:55:57.450
Lieutenant Recelle?
We got incoming.

1750
01:55:57.533 --> 01:55:59.744
♪ ♪

1751
01:56:56.759 --> 01:56:58.177
Oh, my God.

1752
01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.004
Look at that.

1753
01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.640
DAVID: There must be
thousands of them.

1754
01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:47.977
Millions of them.
What the hell are they doing?

1755
01:57:48.061 --> 01:57:50.563
Looks like they're preparing
an invasion.

1756
01:58:18.049 --> 01:58:21.052
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1757
01:58:21.135 --> 01:58:23.221
No, no. This thing
comes fully loaded.

1758
01:58:23.304 --> 01:58:26.224
AM/FM radio, reclining
bucket seats and...

1759
01:58:26.307 --> 01:58:28.434
power windows.

1760
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.743
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

1761
01:58:48.121 --> 01:58:50.289
We're in.

1762
01:58:55.545 --> 01:58:57.296
Do it. Do it.

1763
01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.714
Do it.

1764
01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:01.259
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1765
01:59:01.342 --> 01:59:03.636
Eagle One, the package
is being delivered.

1766
01:59:03.719 --> 01:59:05.763
Stand by to engage.

1767
01:59:07.014 --> 01:59:09.308
Roger.
Eagle One, check left.

1768
01:59:13.479 --> 01:59:15.690
MALE OFFICER: Listen up!
We have an emergency situation.

1769
01:59:15.773 --> 01:59:18.109
We need everyone to grab
everything they can.

1770
01:59:18.192 --> 01:59:19.819
Only what you can carry.

1771
01:59:19.902 --> 01:59:22.113
We need to get you inside
immediately.

1772
01:59:25.658 --> 01:59:27.243
The virus is in.

1773
01:59:32.707 --> 01:59:35.543
All we can do now is pray.

1774
01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:38.754
Delivery complete. Engage.

1775
01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.256
Delivery complete.
It's a go.

1776
01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:42.758
Eagle One.
Fox three.

1777
01:59:46.762 --> 01:59:48.598
Gentlemen, this is it.

1778
01:59:51.767 --> 01:59:53.769
Come on, come on,
come on.

1779
02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:01.777
Damn it.

1780
02:00:06.699 --> 02:00:08.576
Virus ineffective.
Disengage.

1781
02:00:08.659 --> 02:00:10.620
-Get your people out.
-Disengage.

1782
02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:12.163
Rear flank, follow suit.

1783
02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:16.667
WHITMORE:
Hold on, Command.

1784
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:18.002
I want another shot at it.

1785
02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:20.213
Sir, I strongly recommend
you disengage.

1786
02:00:20.296 --> 02:00:23.883
Eagle One.
Fox three.

1787
02:00:37.104 --> 02:00:38.856
-(cheering)
-Direct hit!

1788
02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.816
It's a hit! Squadron leaders,
fire at will!

1789
02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.485
Fire at will!

1790
02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.487
We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take flight.

1791
02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:48.699
-Eagle Six at seven.
-Eagle Five at three.

1792
02:00:48.783 --> 02:00:50.826
Eagle One. Fox two.

1793
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.578
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1794
02:01:01.545 --> 02:01:05.383
Evasive maneuvers! Squadron
leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1795
02:01:05.466 --> 02:01:06.926
Prepare to engage!

1796
02:01:11.806 --> 02:01:15.351
All right, Mr. President!
Here we go!

1797
02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:17.436
All right, baby.
I've gotcha!

1798
02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:21.816
Payback's a bitch,
ain't it?

1799
02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:26.404
Okay. Job's done.
Let's go home.

1800
02:01:26.487 --> 02:01:27.697
Gladly.

1801
02:01:29.156 --> 02:01:31.659
(thump)

1802
02:01:31.742 --> 02:01:33.286
What's up?

1803
02:01:33.369 --> 02:01:34.787
It's stuck.

1804
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:36.706
-What?
-It's not responding. It's stuck.

1805
02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.165
Try it again.

1806
02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:55.349
Come on, come on!

1807
02:02:11.782 --> 02:02:13.659
Come on, come on!
Inside!

1808
02:02:13.743 --> 02:02:16.662
-Get to the back of the elevator!
-Hurry!

1809
02:02:16.746 --> 02:02:18.706
Come on. Come on!

1810
02:02:18.789 --> 02:02:21.709
(screaming)

1811
02:02:27.798 --> 02:02:29.508
Steve! Steve!

1812
02:02:34.889 --> 02:02:36.515
What the hell are you doing?

1813
02:02:36.599 --> 02:02:38.684
It's not me.
They're overriding the system.

1814
02:02:38.768 --> 02:02:40.353
Oh, shit!

1815
02:02:40.436 --> 02:02:42.480
Um, hide.

1816
02:02:45.775 --> 02:02:48.361
(screaming)

1817
02:02:48.444 --> 02:02:51.697
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1818
02:02:51.781 --> 02:02:53.866
Come on in.

1819
02:02:53.949 --> 02:02:56.660
(JULIUS prays in Hebrew)

1820
02:02:56.744 --> 02:02:58.662
I'm not Jewish.

1821
02:02:58.746 --> 02:03:00.539
Nobody's perfect.

1822
02:03:00.623 --> 02:03:02.124
(continues praying)

1823
02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.628
Are you scared?

1824
02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:06.712
Me, too.

1825
02:03:08.714 --> 02:03:11.759
-Eagle Seven, fox two.
-Eagle Three, fox two.

1826
02:03:18.766 --> 02:03:20.393
We're running out
of missiles, sir.

1827
02:03:20.476 --> 02:03:22.228
We're not causing
enough damage.

1828
02:03:22.311 --> 02:03:23.896
It's settling directly over us.

1829
02:03:33.197 --> 02:03:35.699
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

1830
02:03:35.783 --> 02:03:38.119
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.

1831
02:03:43.499 --> 02:03:45.584
Target at 12 o'clock!

1832
02:03:47.503 --> 02:03:49.171
My God! They're everywhere!

1833
02:03:50.798 --> 02:03:53.092
-Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
-I see 'em!

1834
02:03:56.554 --> 02:03:58.722
Squadron leaders,
I want a weapons check!

1835
02:04:00.516 --> 02:04:02.977
You're out of
time! You've gotta disable it now!

1836
02:04:06.522 --> 02:04:09.567
I'm in range. Locking on.

1837
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:12.111
I've got tone.
Eagle One, fox two!

1838
02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:23.706
That is a negative impact.

1839
02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:26.500
That is an NI.
Negative impact.

1840
02:04:26.584 --> 02:04:28.836
I'm out of missiles.
Eagle Two!

1841
02:04:28.919 --> 02:04:30.588
I'm on it.

1842
02:04:32.882 --> 02:04:34.675
Oh, Jesus!

1843
02:04:36.802 --> 02:04:39.138
Sir, all missiles
have been fired.

1844
02:04:39.221 --> 02:04:40.723
You're out of time!
Get your ass out of there!

1845
02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:42.975
-We're not done yet!
-Get as far away as you can!

1846
02:04:43.058 --> 02:04:45.060
Doesn't anyone have
any missiles left?

1847
02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:48.647
RUSSELL: Sorry I'm late,
Mr. President!

1848
02:04:51.108 --> 02:04:52.693
I kinda
got hung up back there!

1849
02:04:52.776 --> 02:04:56.030
-Pilot, you armed?
-Armed and ready, sir!

1850
02:04:56.113 --> 02:04:57.740
I'm packing!

1851
02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:01.368
-Who is that guy?
-Put him on speaker.

1852
02:05:01.452 --> 02:05:03.704
-Pilot, identify yourself.
-It's me!

1853
02:05:03.787 --> 02:05:06.165
Russell Casse, sir.

1854
02:05:06.248 --> 02:05:08.375
I told you
I wouldn't let you down!

1855
02:05:08.459 --> 02:05:11.670
Just keep those guys off me for
a few more seconds, will you?

1856
02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:15.382
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven,
take flanking positions.

1857
02:05:15.466 --> 02:05:17.134
I want you to look
after this guy, okay?

1858
02:05:17.218 --> 02:05:21.263
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1859
02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:24.433
Gentlemen!
Let's plow the road!

1860
02:05:31.690 --> 02:05:34.109
We'll draw them off
and it'll be all yours!

1861
02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:36.820
Oh-ho! Look out!
Coming through!

1862
02:05:38.489 --> 02:05:39.740
I've got tone.

1863
02:05:41.825 --> 02:05:44.537
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1864
02:05:51.752 --> 02:05:53.462
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1865
02:05:53.546 --> 02:05:56.674
(alarm blaring)

1866
02:05:56.757 --> 02:05:58.133
It's jammed.

1867
02:05:59.176 --> 02:06:01.053
It won't fire!

1868
02:06:04.181 --> 02:06:05.766
Damn it!

1869
02:06:08.143 --> 02:06:10.813
(alarm blaring)

1870
02:06:16.443 --> 02:06:18.529
Do me a favor.

1871
02:06:20.489 --> 02:06:24.285
Tell my children
I love them very much.

1872
02:06:27.329 --> 02:06:30.541
All right,
you alien assholes!

1873
02:06:30.624 --> 02:06:33.210
In the words
of my generation,

1874
02:06:33.294 --> 02:06:37.256
up yours!

1875
02:06:37.339 --> 02:06:39.258
Dad! What's he doing?

1876
02:06:39.341 --> 02:06:40.759
RUSSELL:
Come on, baby!

1877
02:06:40.843 --> 02:06:42.803
Come on, baby, come on!

1878
02:06:45.806 --> 02:06:47.266
Good luck, buddy.

1879
02:06:54.064 --> 02:06:55.733
(laughing)

1880
02:06:55.816 --> 02:06:58.152
Hello, boys!

1881
02:06:58.235 --> 02:07:01.947
I'm back!

1882
02:07:20.883 --> 02:07:22.718
He did it!

1883
02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:24.803
The son of a bitch did it!

1884
02:07:24.887 --> 02:07:27.723
(cheering)

1885
02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.141
All right!

1886
02:07:51.622 --> 02:07:53.791
What your father did
was very brave.

1887
02:07:55.459 --> 02:07:56.919
You should be proud of him.

1888
02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.630
I am.

1889
02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:21.610
We know how to take 'em out,
General. Spread the word.

1890
02:08:21.694 --> 02:08:24.571
(cheering continues)

1891
02:08:24.655 --> 02:08:28.075
Get on the wire to every
squadron around the world.

1892
02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:31.453
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1893
02:08:45.217 --> 02:08:46.719
What do you think?

1894
02:08:47.803 --> 02:08:50.139
(sighs)
Checkmate.

1895
02:09:15.622 --> 02:09:17.082
Well, it's funny.

1896
02:09:17.166 --> 02:09:19.877
I always thought things
like these would kill me.

1897
02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.128
(chuckles)

1898
02:09:22.755 --> 02:09:24.006
Thank you.

1899
02:09:32.639 --> 02:09:34.266
It's been a pleasure.

1900
02:09:35.642 --> 02:09:37.019
Steve, you too.

1901
02:09:41.106 --> 02:09:42.900
Only one thing
left to do.

1902
02:09:48.781 --> 02:09:50.449
Ready?

1903
02:09:50.532 --> 02:09:52.326
Yes, sir.

1904
02:09:58.707 --> 02:10:01.752
Hey, all right!
Look at us!

1905
02:10:01.835 --> 02:10:05.339
Take a look at
the earthlings. Goodbye!

1906
02:10:05.422 --> 02:10:07.216
Y'all take care, all right?
Nothin' but love for you!

1907
02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:08.592
-Goodbye!
-Nothin' but love for you!

1908
02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.763
Do you think they have any clue
what's about to happen to 'em?

1909
02:10:12.846 --> 02:10:15.307
Oh, not a chance in hell.
Good night!

1910
02:10:17.267 --> 02:10:18.352
(alien squeals)

1911
02:10:19.645 --> 02:10:22.356
(recorded evil laughter)

1912
02:10:22.439 --> 02:10:23.524
Peace!

1913
02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.915
We're loose. Can you get us
out of here in 30 seconds?

1914
02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.667
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1915
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:43.585
Forget the fat lady.
You're obsessed with the fat lady.

1916
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:44.711
Drive us out of here!

1917
02:10:52.261 --> 02:10:54.513
-They're chasing us.
-Oh, really. You think?

1918
02:11:02.813 --> 02:11:04.189
Oh, that was a hit.
I took a hit.

1919
02:11:04.273 --> 02:11:06.817
We're not hit! We're not hit!
Stop side-seat driving!

1920
02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.865
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel!
Exit left!

1921
02:11:12.948 --> 02:11:14.658
Where the hell
do you think I'm going?

1922
02:11:14.741 --> 02:11:15.784
Okay, okay. We're...

1923
02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:27.921
Agh!

1924
02:11:34.678 --> 02:11:36.889
-They're closing up on us.
-Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1925
02:11:36.972 --> 02:11:39.766
Go faster, must go faster,
must go faster.

1926
02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:43.061
-Go, go, go, go, go!
-Aaaaaah!

1927
02:11:51.987 --> 02:11:53.530
STEVEN: Oh!

1928
02:11:53.614 --> 02:11:55.741
Elvis has left the building!

1929
02:11:55.824 --> 02:11:57.743
(imitating Elvis)
Thank you very much.

1930
02:11:57.826 --> 02:12:00.037
Oh, I love you, man.

1931
02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:11.798
(growls)

1932
02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:35.739
(lively chattering)

1933
02:12:58.804 --> 02:13:01.056
(cheering)

1934
02:13:02.933 --> 02:13:04.643
(yelling in foreign language)

1935
02:13:04.726 --> 02:13:07.896
(crowd cheering)

1936
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:11.233
(cheering)

1937
02:13:30.919 --> 02:13:32.754
They're going down
all over the world, Tom.

1938
02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:34.339
We got 'em beat.

1939
02:13:34.423 --> 02:13:37.134
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1940
02:13:40.887 --> 02:13:43.724
We lost contact
with Captain Hiller

1941
02:13:43.807 --> 02:13:46.518
and Levinson
nearly 20 minutes ago.

1942
02:13:47.936 --> 02:13:49.479
(radar beeping)

1943
02:13:49.563 --> 02:13:54.026
Hold it! Hold on, sir.
I've got something on radar.

1944
02:14:40.864 --> 02:14:43.533
Sorry, sir.

1945
02:14:43.617 --> 02:14:45.077
-Good job.
-Thank you.

1946
02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.829
-Well done, Captain.
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1947
02:14:55.253 --> 02:14:56.463
David...

1948
02:14:58.882 --> 02:15:00.634
Not bad.

1949
02:15:03.845 --> 02:15:06.389
Thank you, Mr. President.

1950
02:15:06.473 --> 02:15:08.850
Not too bad at all.

1951
02:15:10.477 --> 02:15:12.771
Oh, so this is healthy?

1952
02:15:12.854 --> 02:15:14.648
Oh, I could
get used to it.

1953
02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:17.567
(both chuckle)

1954
02:15:26.993 --> 02:15:30.997
(distant explosions)

1955
02:15:33.208 --> 02:15:35.460
Happy Fourth
of July, Daddy.

1956
02:15:35.544 --> 02:15:37.629
Same to you, Munchkin.

1957
02:15:39.422 --> 02:15:41.758
Didn't I promise
you fireworks?

1958
02:15:41.842 --> 02:15:43.260
Yeah.
