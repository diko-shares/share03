00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.704
<i>For those who haven't
read the plaque, we'll read the plaque.</i>

3
00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:15.668
<i>"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the moon."</i>

4
00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:18.504
<i>"July 1969."</i>

5
00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:22.549
<i>"We came in peace for all mankind."</i>

6
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.320
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
l'm hanging up.

7
00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:08.781
Sir, l think you should listen to this.

8
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.788
Agh!

9
00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:19.083
<i>- Goddamn it!</i>
- Sir?

10
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.250
Sir?

11
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.962
<i>Come on, baby,
come on, baby, come on!

12
00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.757
This better not be
another damn Russian spy job!

13
00:03:26.924 --> 00:03:29.134
Boys at air traffic say the skies are clear.

14
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:31.053
It's the real thing.

15
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.222
A radio signal from another world.

16
00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.848
Let's not jump the gun here.

17
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:38.143
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...

18
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.146
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

19
00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:42.898
Wait, this can't be right.

20
00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:45.734
The calculated distance from source...

21
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.113
...is only 375,000km.

22
00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:53.992
It's coming from the moon.

23
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:10.968
- Who else knows about this?
- S.E.T.l. in New Mexico identified a signal.

24
00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.763
But, uh ...
they're even more confused than we are, sir.

25
00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:18.183
Excuse me.

26
00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.813
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.982
Radar reception has been impaired...

28
00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.192
...but we were able to get these.

29
00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:31.864
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km...

30
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.617
...and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

31
00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:37.327
What the hell is it?

32
00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.496
- A meteor?
- No, sir.

33
00:04:39.663 --> 00:04:42.166
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?

34
00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:44.543
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

35
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.795
- It's what?
- lt's, uh...

36
00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:49.298
It's slowing down, sir.

37
00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:59.099
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

38
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.351
Then wake him!

39
00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:06.732
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

40
00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.359
- It's me.
<i>- Hi.</i>

41
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:12.529
<i>- What time is it there ?</i>
- lt's 2:45 in the morning.

42
00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:16.783
<i>- I know l didn't wake you.</i>
- As a matter of fact, you did.

43
00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:18.619
Liar.

44
00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:22.456
I have a confession to make.

45
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:26.251
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

46
00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:29.588
<i>You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?</i>

47
00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.758
- Did you?
<i>- Of course not.</i>

48
00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:35.552
- You're coming home after the luncheon?
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

49
00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.263
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

50
00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:44.269
<i>- Hi, honey!</i>
- Hi, l miss you.

51
00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:49.525
<i>President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40 percent.</i>

52
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:51.276
He's good.

53
00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:55.030
<i>Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore ?</i>

54
00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:59.117
<i>Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from Ieadership in politics.</i>

55
00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:01.161
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

56
00:06:01.954 --> 00:06:05.207
- Traitor.
<i>- They elected a warrior and got a wimp.</i>

57
00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:09.470
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr. President.

58
00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:12.222
That game couldn't have been pretty.

59
00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.933
Thank you, sir.

60
00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.728
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

61
00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.900
They're not attacking your policies,
they're attacking your age.

62
00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:25.444
"Whitmore seems less like the president...

63
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:31.158
...and more like the orphaned child Oliver
asking, 'Please, sir, l'd like some more.'"

64
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.329
- That's clever.
- Well, l'm not laughing.

65
00:06:35.496 --> 00:06:37.915
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

66
00:06:38.082 --> 00:06:40.167
You were thought of as young, idealistic...

67
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:43.045
Now... the message has gotten lost.

68
00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:46.173
It's just too much politics.
lt's too much compromise.

69
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.552
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

70
00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:53.847
Mr. President, it's the Secretary of Defense.

71
00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:59.918
Yes.

72
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.591
Could...you say that again?

73
00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:42.252
<i>Temperature is 95o in Central Park...</i>

74
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.173
<i>Let's go to Nick Jones
and get us a travel report for the beaches...</i>

75
00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:48.717
So why are you waiting, hmm?

76
00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:52.221
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

77
00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:56.100
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

78
00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:06.860
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

79
00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:09.530
If you don't move soon,
l'll start to decompose.

80
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:17.830
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

81
00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:23.627
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.

82
00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:27.381
It's been ... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

83
00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:29.675
- Three years.
- All right, three... four.

84
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:32.261
You're divorced, move on.
This is not healthy.

85
00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.514
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

86
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.312
- Checkmate.
- Wait a minute.

87
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.148
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

88
00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:47.818
- Wait a minute. This is not checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

89
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.070
Just hold on! This is not checkmate.

90
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.616
Oh ... Checkmate!

91
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.995
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

92
00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:01.290
Yeah, I love <i>X-Files,</i> too.
I hope you get to see it.

93
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.209
David! David!

94
00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:07.171
What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?

95
00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:09.339
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.

96
00:09:09.506 --> 00:09:11.592
What's the... What's the big emergency?

97
00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:15.512
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

98
00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.307
We got static, snow, all kinds of distortions.

99
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:19.933
- Marty.
- Nobody knows...

100
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.853
There's a reason
we have bins labeled "Recycle"!

101
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.731
What the hell is going on? My God in heaven!

102
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.984
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

103
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.111
Did you switch transponder channels?

104
00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:34.364
Oh, please! You think l'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?

105
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:36.992
Okay, let's point the dish at another satellite.

106
00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:39.661
We tried that. lt didn't work.

107
00:09:39.828 --> 00:09:42.039
It's almost as though they weren't there.

108
00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:44.500
All right. What have we got here?

109
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:52.049
This is impossible.

110
00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:55.052
<i>We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...</i>

111
00:09:55.219 --> 00:10:00.557
- The signal's all screwed up.
- Stop it! Just leave it alone. You'll break it!

112
00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:02.893
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

113
00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:11.318
Oh, no.

114
00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:17.991
Good morning, Lucas.

115
00:10:18.158 --> 00:10:22.037
You see these?
l got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

116
00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:25.040
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes...

117
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:28.126
...I'm getting someone else.

118
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:39.221
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

119
00:10:42.766 --> 00:10:44.476
Agh!

120
00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:47.729
Whoo!

121
00:10:50.065 --> 00:10:52.317
Ya-hoo!

122
00:10:52.484 --> 00:10:54.861
Russell! What are you doing?

123
00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:12.838
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

124
00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.506
Whoa!

125
00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:18.969
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

126
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.388
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

127
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:27.019
Are you sure?

128
00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:09.144
CNS is running a story that we're covering up
a nuclear-testing experiment.

129
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.022
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.

130
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:14.191
NASA wants to know our position.

131
00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:16.360
Our official position is...

132
00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:18.403
...we have no official position.

133
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.364
- Connie!
- What is going on here?

134
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.532
Guys, would l keep you out of the loop?

135
00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.201
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

136
00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.036
What? l can't hear you.

137
00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:29.039
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

138
00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:32.167
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

139
00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:34.336
What if it doesn't pass us by?

140
00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.880
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?

141
00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.633
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

142
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.553
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

143
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.890
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

144
00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:49.226
But that's not gonna keep.

145
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:52.229
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

146
00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:57.025
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the president said.

147
00:12:57.192 --> 00:12:59.069
Isn't that a little premature?

148
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.863
We have over 50 percent of the armed forces
on weekend leave.

149
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.742
Plus the commanders and troops
that are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

150
00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:09.621
The object has settled into a stationary orbit.

151
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.498
- Well, that's good news.
- Uh, not really, sir.

152
00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:15.516
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

153
00:13:15.683 --> 00:13:18.352
Smaller than the whole, sir...

154
00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:21.063
...yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

155
00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:25.776
Where are they heading?

156
00:13:25.943 --> 00:13:29.238
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

157
00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:02.076
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

158
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:09.333
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout
over a 13km area.

159
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.836
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

160
00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:16.048
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

161
00:14:20.428 --> 00:14:22.012
Jeez!

162
00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:26.183
Get me Atlantic Command.

163
00:14:29.437 --> 00:14:30.563
Hang on, sir.

164
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.191
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

165
00:14:34.358 --> 00:14:38.028
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

166
00:14:38.571 --> 00:14:39.947
Correction, sir.

167
00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:42.199
<i>We have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>

168
00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:46.704
Mr. President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

169
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:49.915
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

170
00:14:53.377 --> 00:14:57.631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are interrupting our regular broadcast...</i>

171
00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:01.385
<i>...to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>

172
00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:05.514
<i>This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.</i>

173
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:08.684
<i>How would you describe
what you are seeing?</i>

174
00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:11.812
<i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly...</i>

175
00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.148
<i>...to be a comet or meteor.</i>

176
00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:17.860
<i>Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside...</i>

177
00:15:18.027 --> 00:15:20.529
<i>...as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>

178
00:15:20.696 --> 00:15:25.075
<i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i>

179
00:15:25.242 --> 00:15:27.620
Mr. President,
we have an AWAC <i>off</i> the West Coast.

180
00:15:27.786 --> 00:15:30.289
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

181
00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:35.002
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

182
00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.671
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

183
00:15:37.838 --> 00:15:41.842
Negative.
We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

184
00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:45.387
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

185
00:15:45.554 --> 00:15:49.683
Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

186
00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:53.020
<i>We still have zero visibility.</i>

187
00:15:54.813 --> 00:15:57.233
<i>lnstrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>

188
00:15:58.108 --> 00:16:01.111
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.</i>

189
00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:02.279
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

190
00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:05.616
<i>It may be clearing.</i>

191
00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:14.833
Pull out!

192
00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:28.639
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

193
00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:31.058
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

194
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.394
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

195
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.312
Alex, organize a military escort.

196
00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:38.399
Mr. President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.

197
00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:42.778
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.

198
00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:45.906
- We can discuss this on the way.
- l'm not leaving.

199
00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:49.410
We have to maintain a working government.

200
00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:54.456
Take the vice president, the whole cabinet,
and the joint chiefs to a secured location.

201
00:16:54.623 --> 00:16:55.749
I'm staying.

202
00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:59.837
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

203
00:17:00.004 --> 00:17:03.632
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

204
00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:05.801
We'll advise people not to panic.

205
00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:09.013
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

206
00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:10.973
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

207
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.935
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

208
00:17:15.352 --> 00:17:19.064
Mr. President, with your permission,
l'd like to remain at your side.

209
00:17:21.483 --> 00:17:23.360
I had a feeling you would.

210
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:28.616
And what happens
if they do become hostile?

211
00:17:30.826 --> 00:17:32.870
Then God help us.

212
00:17:33.162 --> 00:17:35.623
<i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>

213
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:38.959
<i>It is apparently what is causing
alI the distortions...</i>

214
00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:43.422
David, are you watching this?

215
00:17:46.091 --> 00:17:50.387
<i>There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>

216
00:17:50.554 --> 00:17:52.723
<i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i>

217
00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:57.394
Marty, listen to this. l got a lock on
that signal pattern so we <i>can</i> filter it out.

218
00:17:57.561 --> 00:18:00.898
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.

219
00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:03.567
It's reducing itself every time it recycles...

220
00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:06.695
...so eventually it'll disappear...

221
00:18:06.862 --> 00:18:09.281
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

222
00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:14.578
David, haven't you been watching? David!

223
00:18:16.622 --> 00:18:21.210
<i>Good afternoon- So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i>

224
00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:25.506
We have to ask you to stay calm,
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

225
00:18:25.673 --> 00:18:29.093
<i>We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...</i>

226
00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:32.096
- lt's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

227
00:18:32.262 --> 00:18:34.848
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles...</i>

228
00:18:35.015 --> 00:18:40.104
<i>...the other two are headed towards New York
and Washington, DC.</i>

229
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.066
Marty. Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

230
00:18:44.233 --> 00:18:46.110
We're heading down there now.

231
00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:49.113
Okay, everybody! Head down to the basement.

232
00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:52.700
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!

233
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.954
There's no shame in hiding.

234
00:18:57.121 --> 00:18:59.206
Oh, I'd better call my mother.

235
00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:13.303
Well, look who we have here.

236
00:19:16.932 --> 00:19:19.643
Russ, l heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

237
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.854
Dusted the wrong field.

238
00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:27.317
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

239
00:19:27.484 --> 00:19:31.238
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

240
00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:36.660
Years back, he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

241
00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:40.998
Tell them about it, Russ. Get a few beers in him
and he'll tell you all about it.

242
00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:43.000
Won't you, Russ?

243
00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:47.212
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

244
00:19:47.963 --> 00:19:49.673
...sexual things?

245
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.760
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

246
00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:19.536
Well, wake up!

247
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.580
What's happening?
What's going on?

248
00:20:21.747 --> 00:20:24.166
- What's that?
- Let's get out of here, come on!

249
00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:29.421
Wow!

250
00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:50.818
Mommy, lookit!

251
00:20:54.363 --> 00:20:57.074
It's too early, baby.

252
00:21:02.496 --> 00:21:04.540
Is it an earthquake?

253
00:21:04.706 --> 00:21:06.583
Not even a four-pointer.

254
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.794
Go back to sleep.

255
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:26.186
Daddy!

256
00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:29.982
What are you doing here?

257
00:21:30.148 --> 00:21:33.443
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?

258
00:22:06.977 --> 00:22:09.438
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

259
00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:32.377
Oh, man! What is that?

260
00:23:36.108 --> 00:23:37.651
The signal!

261
00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:41.113
My God!

262
00:23:57.754 --> 00:23:59.840
Now what do we do?

263
00:24:00.507 --> 00:24:02.342
Address the nation.

264
00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:05.262
There's gonna be
a lot of frightened people out there.

265
00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:06.930
Yeah.

266
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:09.057
I'm one of them.

267
00:24:11.768 --> 00:24:13.645
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

268
00:24:13.812 --> 00:24:15.772
He's just trying to impress you.

269
00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:18.692
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job...

270
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:21.236
...and stop slobbering all over my shoes.

271
00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:39.671
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

272
00:24:39.838 --> 00:24:43.884
Neighbors are moving out. l guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

273
00:24:46.178 --> 00:24:48.263
A little shake and they running.

274
00:24:48.889 --> 00:24:52.225
<i>Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.</i>

275
00:24:52.392 --> 00:24:54.936
There's something on the news
about the quake!

276
00:24:57.522 --> 00:24:59.274
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.

277
00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:02.736
- What you doing going out there?
- Shooting aliens.

278
00:25:02.903 --> 00:25:05.572
Oh, you shooting aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?

279
00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:07.657
What you got? Turn around.

280
00:25:07.824 --> 00:25:09.993
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

281
00:25:12.287 --> 00:25:14.331
Watch out! Watch it now!

282
00:25:14.498 --> 00:25:16.750
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.

283
00:25:18.293 --> 00:25:20.378
Ow! Dylan!

284
00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.644
Come on, honey, let's go!

285
00:25:51.493 --> 00:25:53.662
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

286
00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:55.997
Babe?

287
00:25:58.333 --> 00:25:59.668
Boom! Boom! Boom!

288
00:26:02.921 --> 00:26:06.341
<i>Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived...</i>

289
00:26:06.508 --> 00:26:09.886
<i>...over the capitals
of lndia, England, and Germany...</i>

290
00:26:10.053 --> 00:26:13.723
<i>...bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15
of these city-size spacecraft.</i>

291
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.518
l know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

292
00:26:16.685 --> 00:26:18.562
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

293
00:26:18.728 --> 00:26:21.064
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!

294
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.482
Ma! Ma, listen!

295
00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:26.069
Uh...Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

296
00:26:26.236 --> 00:26:28.238
Don't argue with me! Just go!

297
00:26:28.905 --> 00:26:31.825
David! Why did l just
send my mother to Atlanta?

298
00:26:31.992 --> 00:26:33.869
David! David, talk to me.

299
00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:37.164
Didn't you hear me say that
the signal in the satellite feed ...

300
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.249
...is recycling down to extinction?

301
00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:41.209
- Not really.
- Countdown.

302
00:26:41.376 --> 00:26:44.588
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?

303
00:26:46.464 --> 00:26:49.926
It's like in chess.
First you strategically position your pieces.

304
00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:54.181
Then, when the timing's right,
you ... strike. See?

305
00:26:54.347 --> 00:26:56.933
They're positioning themselves
all over the world ...

306
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.603
...using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

307
00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:04.024
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

308
00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:05.692
And then what?

309
00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:09.738
Checkmate.

310
00:27:11.406 --> 00:27:14.117
Oh, my God ! Oh, my God !

311
00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:16.119
Oh, my God, l gotta call my brother.

312
00:27:16.286 --> 00:27:19.039
I'd better call my housekeeper.
l gotta call my lawyer!

313
00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:20.957
Ah, forget my lawyer.

314
00:27:21.124 --> 00:27:24.377
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.</i>

315
00:27:24.544 --> 00:27:26.463
<i>Good afternoon-</i>

316
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.590
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

317
00:27:28.757 --> 00:27:32.052
<i>...a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.</i>

318
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:35.263
<i>The question of whether or not
we 're alone in the universe...</i>

319
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.307
...has been answered.

320
00:27:37.474 --> 00:27:41.770
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear...

321
00:27:41.937 --> 00:27:44.648
...we must attempt to reserve judgment.

322
00:27:44.814 --> 00:27:47.317
He says he's your husband.

323
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.445
Oh, God...

324
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.408
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.

325
00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:58.912
This is hardly the time
to be having that old discussion.

326
00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:00.497
You gotta leave Washington.

327
00:28:00.664 --> 00:28:04.292
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!

328
00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:07.128
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.

329
00:28:07.295 --> 00:28:09.756
- You are just being paranoid!
<i>- It's not paranoia!</i>

330
00:28:09.923 --> 00:28:12.592
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...

331
00:28:20.642 --> 00:28:23.812
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

332
00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:25.480
- Please?
- Okay.

333
00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:28.775
<i>The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.</i>

334
00:28:30.277 --> 00:28:32.696
<i>If you feel compelled to leave these cities.</i>

335

<i>...please do so in an orderly fashion.</i>

336
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.625
Excuse me! Coming through.

337
00:28:47.002 --> 00:28:48.878
<i>The arrival of the aliens has caused...</i>

338
00:28:49.045 --> 00:28:51.715
<i>...over 10, 000 fender benders
in just a few seconds.</i>

339
00:28:51.881 --> 00:28:54.676
<i>But this is just the beginning...</i>

340
00:28:54.843 --> 00:28:59.472
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- l'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

341
00:28:59.639 --> 00:29:03.059
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

342
00:29:03.226 --> 00:29:05.645
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

343
00:29:07.022 --> 00:29:09.107
Look, why are you acting like this?

344
00:29:09.858 --> 00:29:11.526
Why?

345
00:29:14.529 --> 00:29:15.572
That's why!

346
00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:27.917
Look... I really don't think...

347
00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:31.338
...they flew 90 billion light years
to come and start a fight...

348
00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.382
...and get all rowdy.

349
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:36.384
Look, why don't you just relax?

350
00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:39.512
L'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's going on.

351
00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:47.771
- What are you doing in there, man?
- Nothing, l'm just driving.

352
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:49.898
Look.

353
00:29:50.065 --> 00:29:51.608
Hey, l got these for you.

354
00:29:51.775 --> 00:29:53.401
- Firecrackers!
- You be careful.

355
00:29:53.568 --> 00:29:54.736
Steve, wait.

356
00:29:54.903 --> 00:29:58.198
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

357
00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:03.787
You take care of yourself, you hear?

358
00:30:07.082 --> 00:30:08.750
Look, um ...

359
00:30:08.917 --> 00:30:12.921
Why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

360
00:30:14.756 --> 00:30:17.801
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

361
00:30:17.967 --> 00:30:19.886
Really?

362
00:30:20.345 --> 00:30:21.888
You don't mind?

363
00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:23.932
Well, l mean ...

364
00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:26.643
I will have to let
all my other girlfriends know...

365
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.729
...they can't come over.
I got to postpone the freaky deaky.

366
00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:33.400
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

367
00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:36.903
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

368
00:30:37.654 --> 00:30:38.988
Yes, I am.

369
00:30:39.697 --> 00:30:41.491
Them big old Dumbo ears.

370
00:30:41.658 --> 00:30:43.618
Look at you with them chicken legs.

371
00:30:52.127 --> 00:30:54.045
Come on, Dylan.

372
00:30:58.633 --> 00:30:59.968
Look out!

373
00:31:07.851 --> 00:31:09.561
Hey! Whoa!

374
00:31:09.727 --> 00:31:12.647
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.

375
00:31:12.814 --> 00:31:15.859
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?

376
00:31:16.025 --> 00:31:18.778
- David, you don't have a license.
- You're driving.

377
00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:21.781
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!

378
00:31:24.117 --> 00:31:26.119
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

379
00:31:26.286 --> 00:31:28.705
You're staying there to keep people calm.

380
00:31:28.872 --> 00:31:31.082
I won't let them criticize you for it.

381
00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:36.004
- I appreciate your trying to help me.
- Liar. Stick to the truth . You're good at it.

382
00:31:36.171 --> 00:31:38.548
Okay. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.

383
00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:42.177
I'll leave
as soon as the interviews are done.

384
00:31:42.343 --> 00:31:46.222
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're taking you to Nellis.

385
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:48.725
<i>- And the munchkin ?</i>
- She'll meet you there.

386
00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:51.895
All right. l love you.

387
00:31:52.604 --> 00:31:53.813
I love you.

388
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.025
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

389
00:32:01.237 --> 00:32:03.239
lt's the White House!

390
00:32:03.406 --> 00:32:06.576
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this go any faster?

391
00:32:06.743 --> 00:32:10.747
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! She works for the president.

392
00:32:10.914 --> 00:32:13.541
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.

393
00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:16.252
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So are you so smart?

394
00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:19.547
How come you spent eight years
in MlT to become a cable repairman?

395
00:32:19.714 --> 00:32:20.840
Dad ...

396
00:32:21.007 --> 00:32:23.510
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.

397
00:32:23.676 --> 00:32:25.595
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

398
00:32:26.262 --> 00:32:28.223
Look at these people, look. Huh?

399
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:30.433
Vultures. They take and then they go.

400
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.770
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!

401
00:32:33.937 --> 00:32:36.689
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!

402
00:32:36.856 --> 00:32:40.443
- They're getting in front. l can't go faster.
- l don't wanna argue.

403
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.779
Let's just get there as quickly as possible.

404
00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:46.991
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

405
00:32:48.826 --> 00:32:51.955
<i>A crop-duster was arrested

<i>- Can you give us some of your time?</i>

407

<i>We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped

finding out our weaknesses!</i>

410
00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:08.221
<i>We 've gotta stop them.
They're gonna kill us all!</i>

411
00:33:08.388 --> 00:33:12.559
<i>Some people attribute
his behavior to post-traumatic stress...</i>

412

<i>...from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.</i>

413
00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:17.480
<i>Others have a more unusual theory.</i>

414
00:33:17.647 --> 00:33:19.399
<i>How would you describe Mr. Casse ?</i>

415
00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:22.110
<i>- Keeps to himself. Quiet.
- Private.</i>

416
00:33:22.277 --> 00:33:24.612
<i>When they took him up in the spaceship...</i>

417

<i>...sexually.</i>

419

<i>Mr. Casse is in the county lockup...</i>

420
00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:33.913
Pack up. We're leaving.

00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:38.084
<i>He may be released later tonight...</i>

422
00:33:38.251 --> 00:33:40.336
Miguel, what about Dad?

423
00:33:41.296 --> 00:33:43.381
This could be our last night on Earth.

424
00:33:45.258 --> 00:33:46.968
You don't wanna die a virgin ... do you?

425
00:33:49.014 --> 00:33:51.641
- Come on! We're going.
- No, l'm not going anywhere.

426
00:33:51.808 --> 00:33:53.184
Miguel!

427
00:33:53.351 --> 00:33:54.894
Stop it!

428
00:33:57.522 --> 00:34:02.736
Thanks a lot, partner! Remember!
Get as far away from these things as you can!

429
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.782
You read my mind!

430
00:34:07.949 --> 00:34:11.077
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can !

431
00:34:11.244 --> 00:34:13.663
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

432
00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.791
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

433
00:34:16.958 --> 00:34:18.543
Come on, boy!

437
00:34:30.687 --> 00:34:32.397
Where you been, Stevie?

438
00:34:32.564 --> 00:34:34.899
Man, this is unbelievable. This is, like, huge.

439
00:34:35.066 --> 00:34:39.654
- They've recalled everybody.
- Looks like the mail's still working.

440
00:34:41.448 --> 00:34:43.241
Oh! Oh, oh...

441
00:34:43.408 --> 00:34:46.369
You'll have to
do the honors for me, man.

- Whatever. Shut up and read it.

I'm sorry, man.

You know what you need to do?

450
00:35:09.851 --> 00:35:13.521
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world.

451
00:35:13.688 --> 00:35:15.690
That's what l'm trying to tell you.

452
00:35:15.857 --> 00:35:17.859
See, l like the one-knee approach ..

453
00:35:18.026 --> 00:35:22.030
...because it puts the booty,
like, right in front of the lip...

- That's nothing.

What is this?

Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins.

457
00:35:29.454 --> 00:35:32.248
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

458
00:35:37.003 --> 00:35:39.589

Yes...

<i>...a) ultra brave...</i>

501
00:38:15.587 --> 00:38:18.048
<i>or b) foolhardy?</i>

502
00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:20.800
- What?
<i>- Don't hang up, sweetie.</i>

503
00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:23.219
David! How did you get this number?

504
00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:27.640
<i>- Do me a favor. Walk to the window.</i>
- And l'm looking for what?

505
00:38:27.807 --> 00:38:29.684
<i>You'll see.</i>

506
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:31.811
<i>Over here.</i>

507
00:38:32.979 --> 00:38:35.106
<i>See us?</i>

508
00:38:35.273 --> 00:38:37.150
How does he do that?

509
00:38:45.992 --> 00:38:49.746
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors...

510
00:38:49.913 --> 00:38:53.249
...Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter...

511
00:38:53.416 --> 00:38:55.752
...with a visual communications device.

512
00:38:55.919 --> 00:39:00.006
- Mr. President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

513
00:39:00.173 --> 00:39:02.842
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing liftoff.

514
00:39:03.009 --> 00:39:05.762
<i>...and refitted
with these enormous light panels...</i>

515
00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:08.431
<i>...that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.</i>

516
00:39:08.598 --> 00:39:10.809
<i>Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>

517
00:39:10.975 --> 00:39:13.019
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

518
00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:16.523
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.</i>

519
00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:19.359
This is something l would never believe
that l would be!

520
00:39:19.526 --> 00:39:21.569
In the White House!
Look at this!

521
00:39:22.153 --> 00:39:25.323
If l knew l was gonna meet the president,
l would have worn a tie.

522
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.534
Look at me, l look like a schlemiel.

523
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.952
You look fine, Pops.

524
00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:30.870
Oy, my God !

525
00:39:31.037 --> 00:39:36.042
- David, l don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.

526
00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:39.379
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

527
00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:42.048
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

528
00:39:42.215 --> 00:39:44.467
- The president!
- He wasn't president then.

529
00:39:44.634 --> 00:39:47.178
I punched him, he fought back.
lt was a fight!

530
00:39:47.345 --> 00:39:49.264
A fight that you started!

531
00:39:49.431 --> 00:39:51.266
David thought l was having an affair.

532
00:39:51.433 --> 00:39:53.351
- With the president?
- Which I wasn't!

533
00:39:53.518 --> 00:39:55.812
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

534
00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:58.106
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

535
00:40:00.206 --> 00:40:01.999
You punched the president?

536
00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.250
God!

537
00:40:11.384 --> 00:40:13.302
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

538
00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:17.390
- We're closing in.
<i>- Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.</i>

539
00:40:17.682 --> 00:40:19.934
<i>The three choppers are approaching...</i>

540
00:40:20.101 --> 00:40:25.022
<i>...what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...</i>

541
00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.734
You're leaving now?

542
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:31.654
- See if they've got those pens they give away.
- Dad, what?

543
00:40:33.752 --> 00:40:35.212
I don't have a choice...

544
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:38.799
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

545
00:40:38.965 --> 00:40:41.593
Mr. President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

546
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.971
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

547
00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:47.683
David, you have to tell him !
David, tell him!

548
00:40:50.602 --> 00:40:53.313
U h... I know why we have satellite disruption.

549
00:40:55.774 --> 00:40:57.317
All right. Go ahead.

550
00:40:58.276 --> 00:41:00.070
Okay.

551
00:41:00.237 --> 00:41:05.784
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

552
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:08.286
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

553
00:41:09.413 --> 00:41:13.458
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

554
00:41:13.625 --> 00:41:17.963
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

555
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.341
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...

556
00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:24.428
...our own satellite system.

557
00:41:26.638 --> 00:41:29.766
Excuse me, Mr. President. They're starting.

558
00:41:32.602 --> 00:41:35.188
They're using our own satellites against us.

559
00:41:38.734 --> 00:41:40.193
The clock is ticking.

560
00:41:44.614 --> 00:41:46.950
- Bringing it in to hover.
<i>- Welcome Wagon...</i>

561
00:41:47.117 --> 00:41:49.536
<i>...Echo One- Approaching alien ship.</i>

562
00:41:51.204 --> 00:41:53.373
Initiating communication sequence.

563
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.419
<i>Welcome Wagon has commenced.</i>

564
00:42:03.008 --> 00:42:05.719
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.

565
00:42:05.886 --> 00:42:09.222
- Tell them to evacuate people from the cities.
- Yes, sir.

566
00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:12.392
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

567
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:14.728
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

568
00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:16.188
Kim! My daughter.

569
00:42:17.814 --> 00:42:20.192
U h ... There's something happening here.

570
00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:25.822
They're responding.

571
00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:27.741
<i>Something is happening.</i>

572
00:42:30.786 --> 00:42:34.456
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.

573
00:42:34.623 --> 00:42:36.708
<i>We see it, too. Can't identify it</i>

574
00:42:48.637 --> 00:42:52.474
We are evacuating . l repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

575
00:42:54.768 --> 00:42:57.479
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

576
00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:01.858
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

577
00:43:02.484 --> 00:43:03.777
Nice. Very nice.

578
00:43:03.944 --> 00:43:06.321
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

579
00:43:07.447 --> 00:43:09.032
We have our own phone.

580
00:43:12.202 --> 00:43:13.620
Move out of here.

581
00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:18.792
The president's ordered an evacuation.

582
00:43:18.959 --> 00:43:21.711
<i>Our prayers go out to the pilots' families.</i>

583
00:43:21.878 --> 00:43:24.256
<i>- Indeed, God help us all.</i>
- Mrs. Whitmore.

584
00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:27.008
<i>The visitors responded with terrifying.</i>

585
00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:31.012
<i>Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.</i>

586
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:34.474
<i>People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.</i>

587
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:36.685
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me.

588
00:43:42.524 --> 00:43:45.735
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

589
00:43:45.902 --> 00:43:50.615
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

590
00:44:06.631 --> 00:44:09.175
- Can we move it along?
<i>- Dr. Katz's office.</i>

591
00:44:09.342 --> 00:44:12.554
- Hello. Dr. Katz, please.
<i>- l'm sorry, he's not available.</i>

592
00:44:12.721 --> 00:44:16.182
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

593
00:44:24.524 --> 00:44:27.485
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

594
00:44:27.819 --> 00:44:31.406
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

595
00:44:33.533 --> 00:44:35.619
Mrs. Whitmore!

596
00:44:36.036 --> 00:44:37.954
<i>You must Ieave now.</i>

597
00:44:38.121 --> 00:44:39.497
No!

598
00:44:44.085 --> 00:44:46.212
The First Lady's secured . We're on the move.

599
00:44:56.514 --> 00:44:58.475
They're opening up!

600
00:45:10.111 --> 00:45:12.280
It's so pretty.

601
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.892
Get the hell out of here!

602
00:45:54.614 --> 00:45:57.784
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take <i>off</i> right now.

603
00:45:57.951 --> 00:46:00.203
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

604
00:46:03.665 --> 00:46:05.333
Here.

605
00:46:20.056 --> 00:46:21.516
Time's up.

606
00:47:25.455 --> 00:47:27.248
Oh, crap.

607
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.723
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

608
00:49:07.473 --> 00:49:08.975
Come on, Boomer!

609
00:49:48.848 --> 00:49:49.891
Boomer!

610
00:49:53.686 --> 00:49:55.230
Boomer!

611
00:50:22.632 --> 00:50:25.635
<i>Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation...</i>

612
00:50:25.802 --> 00:50:29.180
<i>...but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.</i>

613
00:50:29.347 --> 00:50:31.516
Good God!

614
00:50:31.683 --> 00:50:33.142
L've been saying it.

615
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:36.938
L've been saying it for ten damn years!
Ain't I, Miguel?

616
00:50:37.105 --> 00:50:39.148
Huh? l've been saying it!

617
00:50:39.899 --> 00:50:42.485
Dad, l'm sick. l don't feel good.

618
00:50:42.652 --> 00:50:43.903
Pull it over, man.

619
00:50:52.578 --> 00:50:56.291
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone. l got it.

620
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.754
Miguel!

621
00:51:02.547 --> 00:51:04.590
Look at all that.

622
00:51:27.113 --> 00:51:30.199
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

623
00:51:33.077 --> 00:51:35.663
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

624
00:51:37.123 --> 00:51:39.500
I n the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

625
00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:43.713
This is just...

626
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:46.966
...not simple any more.

627
00:51:47.884 --> 00:51:49.969
A lot of people died today.

628
00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:57.143
How many didn't have to?

629
00:52:00.146 --> 00:52:01.689
Any news on my wife yet?

630
00:52:03.232 --> 00:52:06.152
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

631
00:52:08.488 --> 00:52:10.531
No radio contact.

632
00:52:17.246 --> 00:52:19.332
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

633
00:52:29.342 --> 00:52:31.135
Here it is.

634
00:52:55.785 --> 00:52:57.870
What happened, Mommy?

635
00:52:59.956 --> 00:53:01.958
I don't know, baby.

636
00:53:02.208 --> 00:53:04.836
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

637
00:53:05.002 --> 00:53:07.046
Our target is to the north ...

638
00:53:07.213 --> 00:53:10.425
...centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

639
00:53:10.591 --> 00:53:12.552
Our Black Knight Squadron...

640
00:53:12.718 --> 00:53:15.054
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

641
00:53:16.597 --> 00:53:18.599
- You?
- Nope.

642
00:53:21.269 --> 00:53:24.188
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.

643
00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:27.316
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

644
00:53:27.483 --> 00:53:31.070
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.

645
00:53:33.406 --> 00:53:34.949
You'll get your chance.

646
00:53:35.616 --> 00:53:37.452
You'll all get your chance.

647
00:53:37.618 --> 00:53:39.412
Good hunting.

648
00:53:39.996 --> 00:53:41.080
Dismissed!

649
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:44.584
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

650
00:53:45.233 --> 00:53:47.276
Ready to go, sir!

651
00:53:48.277 --> 00:53:50.988
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, Captain!

652
00:53:51.155 --> 00:53:53.115
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

653
00:53:53.282 --> 00:53:57.829
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah !

654
00:53:57.995 --> 00:54:01.874
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

655
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:03.668
I'm all ears, brother!

656
00:54:12.635 --> 00:54:13.970
You the man!

657
00:54:19.517 --> 00:54:22.812
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

658
00:54:24.659 --> 00:54:26.161
General Grey here.

659
00:54:26.328 --> 00:54:27.329
Al?

660
00:54:27.496 --> 00:54:30.207
All communications with the cities are down.

661
00:54:30.374 --> 00:54:33.794
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

662
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.546
How about our boys? Where are they?

663
00:54:37.005 --> 00:54:39.383
ETA to target, four minutes.

664
00:54:47.516 --> 00:54:49.184
I shouldn't have left her.

665
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:51.186
Don't worry about it, big man.

666
00:54:51.353 --> 00:54:54.398
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

667
00:54:54.564 --> 00:54:57.734
Or, as the good Reverend would say...

668
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:02.072
"Why we're on
this particular mission, we'll never know."

669
00:55:02.239 --> 00:55:05.117
"But l do know, here today...

670
00:55:05.283 --> 00:55:08.495
...that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."

671
00:55:08.662 --> 00:55:11.832
- Amen, man !
- Amen, Reverend.

672
00:55:25.554 --> 00:55:27.556
Holy God!

673
00:55:31.393 --> 00:55:32.978
Lock and load!

674
00:55:35.856 --> 00:55:39.734
Roger that. L.A. attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

675
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:42.529
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock-on.

676
00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:43.738
Fire at will.

677
00:55:43.905 --> 00:55:45.907
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

678
00:55:47.617 --> 00:55:50.954
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

679
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:53.331
Knight Three, fox three!

680
00:55:53.999 --> 00:55:55.375
Knight Seven, fox three.

681
00:55:57.627 --> 00:56:00.380
Missiles have been fired.

682
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.444
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.

683
00:56:22.611 --> 00:56:25.739
Command, Knight One.
Switching to Sidewinders, moving in.

684
00:56:29.409 --> 00:56:32.496
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

685
00:56:34.372 --> 00:56:35.832
Knight Seven, 120.

686
00:56:35.999 --> 00:56:38.460
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

687
00:56:38.627 --> 00:56:40.212
Knight Seven...

688
00:56:44.508 --> 00:56:45.634
Come on, come on!

689
00:56:51.598 --> 00:56:55.143
They must have a protective shield
over the hull ! Knights, pull up!

690
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.818
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

691
00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:05.654
Pull up!

692
00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.197
Agh!

693
00:57:14.663 --> 00:57:16.331
Blow through, blow through!

694
00:57:16.498 --> 00:57:18.875
Too many of them!

695
00:57:20.669 --> 00:57:22.337
They got another one, sir.

696
00:57:25.632 --> 00:57:28.677
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

697
00:57:31.596 --> 00:57:33.682
I got you covered, Big Daddy!

698
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.728
Damn, they got shields, too!

699
00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:52.367
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

700
00:57:57.289 --> 00:57:58.498
Jesus!

701
00:57:58.665 --> 00:58:00.542
They got another one, sir. And two more.

702
00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:03.044
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing it.

703
00:58:03.211 --> 00:58:05.171
All right, get them out of there.

704
00:58:05.338 --> 00:58:10.093
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission right away!

705
00:58:13.471 --> 00:58:17.017
We're gonna have to make a run for this one!
Let's get low and fast!

706
00:58:17.183 --> 00:58:19.185
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get them!

707
00:58:19.352 --> 00:58:20.770
Whoo!

708
00:58:21.688 --> 00:58:22.689
Watch the deck!

709
00:58:31.323 --> 00:58:35.076
- Squadron leader, abort! Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

710
00:58:35.243 --> 00:58:36.328
Get them out!

711
00:58:43.335 --> 00:58:46.588
- The monitor! Where's the picture?
- We've lost the satellite.

712
00:58:51.217 --> 00:58:53.678
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

713
00:58:55.555 --> 00:58:57.641
Come on, come on ! Move, move, move!

714
00:58:58.975 --> 00:59:03.521
- It's gonna be like white on rice, Big Daddy!
- They ain't got nothing for us! Let's push it!

715
00:59:03.688 --> 00:59:07.901
- I can't shake them.
- Yes, you can. Just the way l showed you.

716
00:59:08.068 --> 00:59:10.570
- L'm gonna try something.
- Nothing stupid!

717
00:59:10.737 --> 00:59:12.280
- You know me!
- That's what I mean.

718
00:59:12.447 --> 00:59:15.617
- Aah!
- Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

719
00:59:16.743 --> 00:59:19.954
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

720
00:59:21.414 --> 00:59:24.668
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- l can't breathe!

721
00:59:25.919 --> 00:59:27.712
Jimmy!

722
00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:29.839
Jimmy!

723
00:59:32.258 --> 00:59:33.677
Jimmy, no!

724
00:59:33.843 --> 00:59:35.804
Affirmative. We have incoming.

725
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.390
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

726
00:59:38.556 --> 00:59:39.891
Friendly?

727
00:59:40.809 --> 00:59:41.976
Sergeant?

728
00:59:42.143 --> 00:59:44.229
I don't think so.

729
01:00:11.464 --> 01:00:12.966
Come on and get me!

730
01:00:17.971 --> 01:00:19.764
What are you shooting at?

731
01:00:19.931 --> 01:00:22.642
Where you at, baby? Come on! Come on!

732
01:00:27.939 --> 01:00:29.274
You can't hit nothing!

733
01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:48.418
Whoa! Low bridge!

734
01:00:53.298 --> 01:00:55.925
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

735
01:00:59.179 --> 01:01:01.181
Ha-ha! Hope you got an airbag!

736
01:01:02.974 --> 01:01:04.684
Whoo!

737
01:01:30.335 --> 01:01:32.170
Aah!

738
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.345
Son of a bitch!

739
01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:40.845
Son of a bitch!

740
01:01:42.972 --> 01:01:44.641
Aah!

741
01:01:44.808 --> 01:01:46.601
That's right! That's right!

742
01:01:46.768 --> 01:01:48.561
Get off! Get <i>off</i> of me!

743
01:01:48.728 --> 01:01:50.647
That's what you'll get! Ha-ha!

744
01:01:50.814 --> 01:01:52.148
Look at you!

745
01:01:52.315 --> 01:01:55.401
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?

746
01:01:55.568 --> 01:01:58.446
Huh? Who's the man?
Wait till l get another plane!

747
01:01:58.613 --> 01:02:01.157
I'm lining all your friends up,
right beside you!

748
01:02:02.784 --> 01:02:05.453
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

749
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.425
Welcome to Earth.

750
01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:32.522
That's what I call a close encounter.

751
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.196
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

752
01:02:49.838 --> 01:02:51.215
Keys. Come on, keys.

753
01:02:52.007 --> 01:02:53.217
Yes!

754
01:02:53.383 --> 01:02:56.261
Come, baby, come on. Come on!

755
01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:58.138
Yes!

756
01:02:58.305 --> 01:03:02.226
<i>Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world...</i>

757
01:03:02.392 --> 01:03:03.977
<i>...with the same results.</i>

758
01:03:04.645 --> 01:03:07.356
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.

759
01:03:08.607 --> 01:03:10.817
Everyone's packing up. They're leaving.

760
01:03:10.984 --> 01:03:15.614
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave, too, then.

761
01:03:24.831 --> 01:03:28.961
It's <i>Air Force One,</i> for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

762
01:03:29.127 --> 01:03:30.796
- I don't feel too good.
- Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

763
01:03:32.904 --> 01:03:33.905
Could be bad weather or good weather.

764
01:03:34.072 --> 01:03:35.823
We could go up or down.

765
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:39.035
We could go back, we could go forwards,
side to side...

766
01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.457
What did I say?

767
01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:49.003
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

768
01:03:49.879 --> 01:03:52.382
Julius, with all of this, I, uh ...

769
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:54.634
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

770
01:03:56.052 --> 01:03:58.304
All he could think of was getting to you.

771
01:04:01.432 --> 01:04:03.518
There's still love there, l think.

772
01:04:05.812 --> 01:04:07.897
Love was never a problem.

773
01:04:08.439 --> 01:04:10.525
All you need is love.

774
01:04:11.067 --> 01:04:13.069
John Lennon . Smart man.

775
01:04:13.236 --> 01:04:15.280
Shot in the back, very sad.

776
01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:21.077
We've moved as many of
our forces away from our bases as possible.

777
01:04:21.244 --> 01:04:25.623
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- l spoke with the joint chiefs at NORAD.

778
01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:29.043
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.

779
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.628
Over American soil?

780
01:04:30.795 --> 01:04:35.133
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

781
01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:38.553
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

782
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.638
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

783
01:04:40.805 --> 01:04:43.057
- What?
- lt's gone, sir.

784
01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:44.892
My God!

785
01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:47.312
The vice president? The joint chiefs?

786
01:04:47.478 --> 01:04:49.522
Mr. President.

787
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:51.482
We must launch.

788
01:04:51.649 --> 01:04:56.154
A delay now would be more costly
than when you waited to evacuate the cities.

789
01:04:56.321 --> 01:05:00.783
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them <i>and</i> us. lf we fire nukes...

790
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:05.455
- Sir, may I remind you, you are a guest here?
- You ever hear of nuclear winter?

791
01:05:05.622 --> 01:05:08.499
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.

792
01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:10.627
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

793
01:05:10.793 --> 01:05:13.838
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

794
01:05:15.757 --> 01:05:18.426
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!

795
01:05:18.593 --> 01:05:20.678
None of you did anything to prevent this!

796
01:05:20.845 --> 01:05:24.515
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

797
01:05:24.682 --> 01:05:26.934
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.

798
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:30.146
It was, what?
ln the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

799
01:05:31.022 --> 01:05:34.442
- Dad . Look, Dad ...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

800
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:36.694
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.

801
01:05:36.861 --> 01:05:40.698
Roswell . Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!

802
01:05:40.865 --> 01:05:43.117
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.

803
01:05:43.284 --> 01:05:44.327
Where was that?

804
01:05:44.494 --> 01:05:45.828
Area 51. Right?

805
01:05:45.995 --> 01:05:49.374
Area 51 . You knew then!
And you did nothing.

806
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.794
Sir.

807
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.713
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids...

808
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.717
...there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

809
01:05:59.884 --> 01:06:02.345
- Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.
- Psh...

810
01:06:02.512 --> 01:06:04.555
And there's no recovered spaceship.

811
01:06:04.722 --> 01:06:07.809
U h, excuse me, Mr. President...

812
01:06:08.226 --> 01:06:11.854
That's not entirely... accurate.

813
01:06:16.734 --> 01:06:18.820
What? Which part?

814
01:06:23.991 --> 01:06:25.993
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

815
01:06:28.207 --> 01:06:30.084
Sorry.

816
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.004
- Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

817
01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.971
Oh, God ...

818
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.230
Okay, okay, let's get this off.

819
01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:12.441
Here, let me help you.

820
01:07:15.485 --> 01:07:17.487
She's hurt pretty badly.

821
01:07:21.658 --> 01:07:24.620
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

822
01:07:26.163 --> 01:07:27.831
But, no!

823
01:07:27.998 --> 01:07:32.336
You got me out here, dragging
your heavy ass through the burning desert...

824
01:07:32.502 --> 01:07:35.797
...with your dreadlocks
sticking out the back of my parachute.

825
01:07:36.423 --> 01:07:38.842
You gotta come down here with an attitude...

826
01:07:39.009 --> 01:07:41.094
...acting all big and bad.

827
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.557
And what the hell is that smell?!

828
01:07:46.433 --> 01:07:48.268
Arrrrgh!

829
01:07:49.686 --> 01:07:51.647
I could've been at a barbecue!

830
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.608
But l ain't mad.

831
01:07:54.983 --> 01:07:58.278
It's all right, it's all right.

832
01:08:13.418 --> 01:08:14.503
Hey!

833
01:08:15.212 --> 01:08:17.464
Hey! Hey...

834
01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:23.929
Hey!

835
01:08:37.192 --> 01:08:39.152
Do you need a lift, soldier?

836
01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:42.364
When l flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

837
01:08:44.992 --> 01:08:46.576
It ain't on the map.

838
01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:49.913
Trust me, it's there.

839
01:09:05.429 --> 01:09:06.805
Attention!

840
01:09:10.767 --> 01:09:12.728
Mr. President. General.

841
01:09:12.894 --> 01:09:15.897
Welcome to Area 51 . Please follow me.

842
01:09:17.441 --> 01:09:19.901
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface...

843
01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:22.904
...and, uh... here's our main research facility.

844
01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.409
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. lt's static free...

845
01:09:27.576 --> 01:09:29.870
Open... the door.

846
01:09:31.288 --> 01:09:32.748
Yes, sir.

847
01:09:54.603 --> 01:09:55.729
My God.

848
01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:57.981
Why the hell wasn't l told about this place?

849
01:09:58.148 --> 01:10:02.319
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

850
01:10:09.284 --> 01:10:11.703
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

851
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.456
How do you get funding
for something like this?

852
01:10:14.623 --> 01:10:17.709
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer...

853
01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:19.920
...$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

854
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.091
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

855
01:10:24.257 --> 01:10:28.428
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

856
01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:31.556
How do you do?

857
01:10:32.182 --> 01:10:34.601
Mr. President!

858
01:10:34.768 --> 01:10:36.645
Wow!

859
01:10:36.812 --> 01:10:37.854
Uh... This...

860
01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:40.065
What a pleasure!

861
01:10:40.732 --> 01:10:42.317
As you can imagine, they...

862
01:10:42.484 --> 01:10:44.361
They don't let us out much.

863
01:10:45.987 --> 01:10:48.240
I can understand that.

864
01:10:49.449 --> 01:10:50.700
Well!

865
01:10:51.118 --> 01:10:54.621
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

866
01:10:54.788 --> 01:10:56.123
Follow me.

867
01:11:46.923 --> 01:11:49.301
She's a beaut, ain't she?

868
01:11:51.553 --> 01:11:56.850
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

869
01:11:57.017 --> 01:11:59.936
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about them?

870
01:12:00.103 --> 01:12:01.354
Oh, hell, no.

871
01:12:01.521 --> 01:12:03.690
No, no, no, no. We know tons about them.

872
01:12:04.608 --> 01:12:06.443
But the neatest stuff...

873
01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:09.613
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

874
01:12:09.779 --> 01:12:14.367
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

875
01:12:14.534 --> 01:12:19.539
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

876
01:12:19.706 --> 01:12:23.210
The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!

877
01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:25.712
Exciting? People are dying out there.

878
01:12:25.879 --> 01:12:28.506
Exciting isn't the word
l'd choose to describe it!

879
01:12:30.759 --> 01:12:33.136
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

880
01:12:33.303 --> 01:12:35.639
You said you can repair their technology.

881
01:12:35.805 --> 01:12:39.559
- Can you tell us anything useful about them?
- Oh, yeah . Well, l mean ...

882
01:12:39.726 --> 01:12:41.853
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

883
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:46.274
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

884
01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:49.236
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

885
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.821
Hey...

886
01:12:51.988 --> 01:12:53.531
Hey.

887
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.534
You guys wanna see them?

888
01:12:58.495 --> 01:12:59.496
Hmm?

889
01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:08.129
Uh, this is...

890
01:13:08.296 --> 01:13:10.340
This is the vault.

891
01:13:10.799 --> 01:13:12.968
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

892
01:13:14.094 --> 01:13:16.096
...the freak show.

893
01:13:38.493 --> 01:13:40.328
When we found them...

894
01:13:40.495 --> 01:13:43.832
...they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

895
01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:47.502
Once we got them off,
we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

896
01:13:48.253 --> 01:13:49.838
Eyes, ears...

897
01:13:50.005 --> 01:13:51.673
...no vocal cords.

898
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.218
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

899
01:13:55.385 --> 01:13:59.556
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

900
01:13:59.723 --> 01:14:03.560
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception. Telepathy.

901
01:14:04.269 --> 01:14:05.312
So...

902
01:14:07.564 --> 01:14:09.649
It's an organic life form.

903
01:14:12.861 --> 01:14:14.571
Can they be killed?

904
01:14:14.738 --> 01:14:16.740
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

905
01:14:16.906 --> 01:14:19.326
These two died in the crash.

906
01:14:19.492 --> 01:14:21.328
This one a few weeks later.

907
01:14:21.494 --> 01:14:25.457
You just... have to get through
their technology, which is...

908
01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:28.585
...I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

909
01:14:30.128 --> 01:14:33.340
David, you unlocked part
of their technology.

910
01:14:33.506 --> 01:14:38.094
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All l did was stumble on their, um...

911
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:41.389
...signal . l don't know
how, uh ... helpful l can be.

912
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:44.726
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

913
01:14:45.852 --> 01:14:48.355
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

914
01:14:49.314 --> 01:14:53.902
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all <i>hope</i> you are.

915
01:15:03.591 --> 01:15:05.093
What code?

916
01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:28.408
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

917
01:15:28.575 --> 01:15:31.160
I'm sorry, Captain . You don't have clearance.

918
01:15:32.537 --> 01:15:34.205
Okay. Come here.

919
01:15:34.372 --> 01:15:36.124
You wanna see my clearance?

920
01:15:39.627 --> 01:15:42.880
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.

921
01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:46.134
- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

922
01:15:47.927 --> 01:15:49.262
Did you see that?

923
01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:54.350
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

924
01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.147
How long has he been unconscious?

925
01:15:59.314 --> 01:16:01.316
- Three hours.
- Get him in containment.

926
01:16:01.482 --> 01:16:04.902
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

927
01:16:05.069 --> 01:16:06.321
When were you planning to inform us?

928
01:16:08.386 --> 01:16:10.638
- It had been deemed classified.
- You should have told us about this

929
01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:11.848
when they first arrived!

930
01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:15.143
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack...

931
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:17.812
...that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

932
01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:21.983
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!

933
01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:23.318
Mr. President.

934
01:16:23.485 --> 01:16:27.197
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

935
01:16:27.363 --> 01:16:30.575
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

936
01:16:30.742 --> 01:16:32.452
Destroyed.

937
01:16:32.619 --> 01:16:36.831
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

938
01:16:36.998 --> 01:16:38.374
Then we were hit.

939
01:16:38.541 --> 01:16:41.628
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

940
01:16:41.795 --> 01:16:43.880
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15 percent.

941
01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:49.094
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on ...

942
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.431
...we're looking at the worldwide destruction
of every major city...

943
01:16:54.349 --> 01:16:56.601
...in the next 36 hours.

944
01:16:58.603 --> 01:17:00.730
We're being exterminated.

945
01:17:04.609 --> 01:17:06.194
Mr. President!

946
01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:08.655
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

947
01:17:08.822 --> 01:17:10.198
- Captain.
- Mr. President.

948
01:17:10.365 --> 01:17:11.407
Well done.

949
01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:14.869
- Where is it now?
- lt's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

950
01:17:16.121 --> 01:17:18.248
I'd like to go see it.

951
01:17:23.628 --> 01:17:27.048
General, l'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

952
01:17:29.676 --> 01:17:31.803
Hasn't anyone told you?

953
01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:37.350
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

954
01:18:29.861 --> 01:18:32.447
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!

955
01:18:32.614 --> 01:18:35.074
Today was the first time l used the subway.

956
01:18:35.241 --> 01:18:37.202
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

957
01:18:37.368 --> 01:18:39.746
These should last us a while.

958
01:18:39.913 --> 01:18:42.123
Don't move. l'll get it for you.
Stay still.

959
01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:46.044
He's your son?

960
01:18:46.211 --> 01:18:47.837
He's my angel.

961
01:18:48.463 --> 01:18:51.341
Was his father stationed here?

962
01:18:51.507 --> 01:18:53.509
No, he, uh ...

963
01:18:53.676 --> 01:18:55.720
He wasn't his father.

964
01:18:56.888 --> 01:18:59.599
But l was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

965
01:19:04.062 --> 01:19:07.148
- So what do you do for a living?
- l'm a dancer.

966
01:19:07.315 --> 01:19:10.026
Oh ... Ballet...

967
01:19:10.193 --> 01:19:12.946
No. Exotic.

968
01:19:14.572 --> 01:19:17.450
Oh ... Sorry.

969
01:19:17.909 --> 01:19:19.994
Don't be. l'm not.

970
01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:22.580
It's good money. Besides...

971
01:19:22.747 --> 01:19:24.582
...my baby's worth it.

972
01:19:24.749 --> 01:19:26.876
Dylan! Come here.

973
01:19:27.043 --> 01:19:29.128
I want you to meet the First Lady.

974
01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:35.760
- Hello.
- Hi.

975
01:19:35.927 --> 01:19:38.263
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

976
01:19:38.429 --> 01:19:40.431
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

977
01:19:40.598 --> 01:19:42.517
I voted for the other guy.

978
01:19:45.311 --> 01:19:49.857
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

979
01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:51.276
Come on, come on.

980
01:19:51.442 --> 01:19:53.069
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

981
01:19:53.236 --> 01:19:55.780
Put the spreader right here, along the ridge.

982
01:19:55.947 --> 01:19:59.909
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

983
01:20:00.618 --> 01:20:03.204
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

984
01:20:03.371 --> 01:20:05.290
Let me get in.

985
01:20:11.462 --> 01:20:13.506
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

986
01:20:14.507 --> 01:20:16.551
Run this right in ...

987
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.142
All right. okay.

988
01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:25.685
Let's proceed.

989
01:20:26.477 --> 01:20:29.522
Now comes the... the really icky part.

990
01:20:29.856 --> 01:20:31.524
Ugh!

991
01:20:31.691 --> 01:20:33.609
Oh, boy.

992
01:20:33.776 --> 01:20:37.322
This is one smelly, disgusting ...

993
01:20:45.747 --> 01:20:46.873
Oh, look at it.

994
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.000
It doesn't look alive, does it?

995
01:20:53.671 --> 01:20:55.256
The arm is moving.

996
01:21:04.265 --> 01:21:07.352
- Agh!
- Doctor? Doctor?

997
01:21:10.355 --> 01:21:11.856
Doctor?

998
01:21:12.857 --> 01:21:14.692
- Agh!
- Don't move!

999
01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:01.781
Dr. Okun?

1000
01:22:24.971 --> 01:22:28.433
Release... me.

1001
01:22:28.599 --> 01:22:30.810
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.

1002
01:22:45.658 --> 01:22:47.952
Release me...

1003
01:22:51.789 --> 01:22:54.542
...now.

1004
01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:03.259
I know there is much
we can learn from each other...

1005
01:23:03.426 --> 01:23:05.887
...if we can negotiate a truce.

1006
01:23:06.721 --> 01:23:09.098
We can find a way to coexist.

1007
01:23:10.975 --> 01:23:13.019
Can there be a peace between us?

1008
01:23:14.228 --> 01:23:16.481
Peace...

1009
01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:19.984
No peace.

1010
01:23:25.823 --> 01:23:27.867
What is it you want us to do?

1011
01:23:30.369 --> 01:23:32.246
Die.

1012
01:23:41.506 --> 01:23:43.216
Die!

1013
01:23:48.346 --> 01:23:50.014
Mr. President.

1014
01:23:51.015 --> 01:23:53.392
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.

1015
01:24:13.204 --> 01:24:15.373
- Are you all right?
- I saw...

1016
01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.083
...his thoughts.

1017
01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:20.086
I saw what they're planning to do.

1018
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.799
They're like locusts.

1019
01:24:24.966 --> 01:24:26.968
They're moving from planet to planet.

1020
01:24:27.134 --> 01:24:29.220
Their whole civilization.

1021
01:24:29.387 --> 01:24:33.057
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.

1022
01:24:35.059 --> 01:24:36.686
And we're next.

1023
01:24:48.406 --> 01:24:50.116
Nuke them.

1024
01:24:51.284 --> 01:24:53.411
Let's nuke the bastards.

1025
01:25:04.714 --> 01:25:06.757
Just my luck. No ice.

1026
01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:10.094
l take it you've heard?

1027
01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:12.430
Hey, toast.

1028
01:25:12.597 --> 01:25:14.599
To the end of the world.

1029
01:25:14.765 --> 01:25:17.143
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

1030
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:19.395
He didn't have any other choice.

1031
01:25:20.438 --> 01:25:22.440
Well, you still believe in him.

1032
01:25:22.607 --> 01:25:24.650
Well, he's a good man.

1033
01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:26.277
Whoa...

1034
01:25:26.444 --> 01:25:28.946
He'd better be. You left me for him.

1035
01:25:29.113 --> 01:25:32.033
Or, you know... for your career.

1036
01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:34.702
You know, it wasn't just my career.

1037
01:25:34.869 --> 01:25:37.288
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

1038
01:25:37.455 --> 01:25:41.584
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

1039
01:25:41.751 --> 01:25:44.962
And, um... I wasn't, um...

1040
01:25:45.129 --> 01:25:47.089
...ambitious enough for you?

1041
01:25:47.256 --> 01:25:51.302
David, you could have done anything
you wanted . Research, development...

1042
01:25:51.469 --> 01:25:53.095
Honey, l was happy where I was.

1043
01:25:53.262 --> 01:25:56.015
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

1044
01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:01.979
I was part of something special.

1045
01:26:17.244 --> 01:26:19.288
Well, if it makes any difference...

1046
01:26:19.455 --> 01:26:21.499
...I never stopped loving you.

1047
01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:24.919
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1048
01:26:43.437 --> 01:26:45.481
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

1049
01:26:52.947 --> 01:26:55.366
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule!

1050
01:26:55.533 --> 01:26:57.034
Pick it up, man!

1051
01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:59.412
Pick it up!

1052
01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:04.625
What the hell are you doing? Get out of there!

1053
01:27:05.459 --> 01:27:08.045
I got something l gotta handle.
l'm borrowing it.

1054
01:27:08.212 --> 01:27:09.422
No, you're not, sir.

1055
01:27:09.964 --> 01:27:12.049
Do you really wanna shoot me?

1056
01:27:14.135 --> 01:27:15.886
Just tell them l hit you.

1057
01:27:22.226 --> 01:27:24.311
<i>Command, this is Retal Op.</i>

1058
01:27:24.478 --> 01:27:27.898
Squadron is in the air.
We are on station and awaiting instructions.

1059
01:27:28.065 --> 01:27:29.817
Break formation. Head to targets.

1060
01:27:34.822 --> 01:27:36.282
Sir.

1061
01:27:36.449 --> 01:27:38.242
They're breaking formation.

1062
01:27:38.409 --> 01:27:42.580
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1063
01:27:42.747 --> 01:27:44.498
Which city will be reached first?

1064
01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:48.043
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1065
01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:51.046
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

1066
01:27:51.213 --> 01:27:55.843
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1067
01:27:58.763 --> 01:28:00.723
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1068
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:02.308
We are in position.

1069
01:28:02.892 --> 01:28:04.935
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1070
01:28:05.102 --> 01:28:07.813
We are going to visual recon.

1071
01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:09.607
<i>Roger.</i>

1072
01:28:13.694 --> 01:28:16.363
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1073
01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:19.825
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1074
01:28:22.703 --> 01:28:24.830
Laser targeting.

1075
01:28:24.997 --> 01:28:26.415
Locked on.

1076
01:28:27.041 --> 01:28:29.877
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

1077
01:28:33.964 --> 01:28:36.926
Mr. President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

1078
01:28:43.891 --> 01:28:45.810
- Mr. President?
- Deploy.

1079
01:28:45.976 --> 01:28:48.729
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1080
01:28:48.896 --> 01:28:50.314
Here we go.

1081
01:28:58.572 --> 01:29:00.115
Bird's away.

1082
01:29:00.282 --> 01:29:03.452
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
lt's on target.

1083
01:29:04.161 --> 01:29:05.746
<i>Approaching.</i>

1084
01:29:06.413 --> 01:29:08.374
May our children forgive us.

1085
01:29:08.541 --> 01:29:11.669
<i>Five seconds to impact. Three, two...</i>

1086
01:29:11.836 --> 01:29:12.962
<i>...one.</i>

1087
01:29:15.089 --> 01:29:16.924
Oh, yeah ! It's a hit!

1088
01:29:21.679 --> 01:29:23.848
Get down! Get down!

1089
01:29:24.014 --> 01:29:26.684
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

1090
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:29.687
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

1091
01:29:29.854 --> 01:29:30.855
Yes, sir!

1092
01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:34.191
- Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

1093
01:29:34.358 --> 01:29:37.361
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
<i>- We have Iost visual.</i>

1094
01:29:37.528 --> 01:29:39.989
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1095
01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:48.622
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1096
01:29:48.789 --> 01:29:51.750
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

1097
01:29:53.794 --> 01:29:57.214
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

1098
01:29:57.381 --> 01:29:59.008
Has the target been destroyed?

1099
01:30:13.397 --> 01:30:14.440
Negative.

1100
01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:19.653
<i>Target remains.</i>

1101
01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:25.326
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>

1102
01:30:28.537 --> 01:30:30.539
Call the other planes back.

1103
01:30:30.706 --> 01:30:34.460
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1104
01:30:34.627 --> 01:30:36.879
I said call them back!

1105
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:42.176
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1106
01:30:42.343 --> 01:30:46.263
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1107
01:31:25.427 --> 01:31:27.513
Jasmine!

1108
01:31:39.483 --> 01:31:41.151
You're late!

1109
01:31:41.318 --> 01:31:44.029
You know l like to make an entrance.

1110
01:31:53.163 --> 01:31:55.541
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

1111
01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:59.044
Mr. President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1112
01:31:59.211 --> 01:32:03.799
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

1113
01:32:06.010 --> 01:32:09.972
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

1114
01:32:10.139 --> 01:32:13.726
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

1115
01:32:14.226 --> 01:32:16.311
We can't stop the bleeding.

1116
01:32:16.937 --> 01:32:19.023
If we'd ...

1117
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:21.316
There's nothing we can do for her.

1118
01:32:23.193 --> 01:32:25.821
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1119
01:32:31.201 --> 01:32:33.162
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1120
01:32:33.328 --> 01:32:35.372
I did?

1121
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:39.710
You just keep growing and growing.

1122
01:32:42.087 --> 01:32:43.589
I can't...

1123
01:32:45.299 --> 01:32:46.717
Hey.

1124
01:32:46.884 --> 01:32:51.305
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

1125
01:32:51.472 --> 01:32:52.973
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1126
01:33:02.649 --> 01:33:06.236
I'm so sorry that l didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1127
01:33:06.403 --> 01:33:08.238
Oh...

1128
01:33:09.239 --> 01:33:10.449
lt's okay.

1129
01:33:12.576 --> 01:33:14.286
The doctors...

1130
01:33:15.788 --> 01:33:17.748
...think that you're...

1131
01:33:17.915 --> 01:33:19.958
...gonna be just fine.

1132
01:33:22.544 --> 01:33:24.463
Liar.

1133
01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:22.688
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1134
01:34:24.690 --> 01:34:26.150
Yeah.

1135
01:34:27.568 --> 01:34:29.653
Mommy's sleeping.

1136
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:34.700
Hey.

1137
01:35:05.522 --> 01:35:06.565
David!

1138
01:35:07.107 --> 01:35:10.152
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!

1139
01:35:10.319 --> 01:35:11.862
Yeah . This I can see.

1140
01:35:12.029 --> 01:35:14.656
We gotta burn this toxic waste...

1141
01:35:14.823 --> 01:35:17.034
...pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1142
01:35:17.201 --> 01:35:19.745
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough ...

1143
01:35:20.787 --> 01:35:22.789
...they won't want it anymore.

1144
01:35:22.956 --> 01:35:24.541
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.

1145
01:35:24.708 --> 01:35:27.878
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1146
01:35:28.045 --> 01:35:31.173
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1147
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.592
David! Even myself.

1148
01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:37.638
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1149
01:35:43.393 --> 01:35:45.354
You see, sometimes...

1150
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.648
...we have to remember what we still have.

1151
01:35:49.024 --> 01:35:50.609
Like what?

1152
01:35:53.445 --> 01:35:57.407
Well ... you still have your health.

1153
01:35:58.325 --> 01:35:59.368
David, David, you need your rest.

1154
01:36:01.432 --> 01:36:04.310
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1155
01:36:07.313 --> 01:36:09.607
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1156
01:36:09.773 --> 01:36:12.443
- Well, you see, a man ...
- No, no, no.

1157
01:36:12.610 --> 01:36:17.281
- No, the other part.
- What? What? l don't want you to catch cold.

1158
01:36:20.659 --> 01:36:22.286
Dahhh!

1159
01:36:22.453 --> 01:36:24.830
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1160
01:36:24.997 --> 01:36:27.917
- Genius.
- Genius?

1161
01:36:28.542 --> 01:36:30.920
My dad. A total genius.

1162
01:36:32.755 --> 01:36:34.632
Jerry, wake up.

1163
01:36:34.798 --> 01:36:37.760
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1164
01:36:38.344 --> 01:36:39.637
What?

1165
01:36:41.889 --> 01:36:43.265
Look at that!

1166
01:36:43.432 --> 01:36:46.769
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1167
01:36:46.936 --> 01:36:49.396
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1168
01:36:51.504 --> 01:36:54.215
- They're here.
- All right, what's this all about?

1169
01:36:54.382 --> 01:36:55.424
I have no idea.

1170
01:36:55.591 --> 01:36:56.801
Get everybody off.

1171
01:36:56.967 --> 01:37:00.221
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1172
01:37:00.763 --> 01:37:01.764
Major Mitchell.

1173
01:37:01.931 --> 01:37:03.683
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1174
01:37:03.849 --> 01:37:06.852
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1175
01:37:08.396 --> 01:37:11.190
See that, uh... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1176
01:37:11.357 --> 01:37:13.526
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1177
01:37:13.693 --> 01:37:15.403
Do it. Shoot it.

1178
01:37:15.569 --> 01:37:18.531
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1179
01:37:24.537 --> 01:37:26.539
What the hell are you doing?!

1180
01:37:26.706 --> 01:37:28.708
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1181
01:37:28.874 --> 01:37:32.211
You see, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

1182
01:37:32.378 --> 01:37:34.880
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?

1183
01:37:35.047 --> 01:37:39.552
My point is, if we can't beat their defenses,
then we gotta get around them.

1184
01:37:39.719 --> 01:37:43.305
Major. One more time... Any time.

1185
01:37:54.567 --> 01:37:57.528
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1186
01:37:58.696 --> 01:38:02.158
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1187
01:38:02.783 --> 01:38:05.077
Are you telling us you can send out a signal ...

1188
01:38:05.244 --> 01:38:07.246
...that will disable all their shields?

1189
01:38:07.413 --> 01:38:10.583
That's right.
Just like they used our satellites against us...

1190
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:12.877
...we can use their own signal against them.

1191
01:38:13.043 --> 01:38:15.755
If we plant a virus into that mother ship...

1192
01:38:15.921 --> 01:38:19.508
...it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1193
01:38:19.675 --> 01:38:21.510
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1194
01:38:21.677 --> 01:38:26.056
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?

1195
01:38:26.849 --> 01:38:29.226
We're... We're gonna, uh...

1196
01:38:29.852 --> 01:38:34.398
...have to... um... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1197
01:38:34.565 --> 01:38:38.444
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1198
01:38:38.611 --> 01:38:43.240
We then upload the virus, set off
some kind of explosion which will disable it.

1199
01:38:43.407 --> 01:38:49.288
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to, uh...

1200
01:38:50.039 --> 01:38:52.875
to... take them... take them out.
Take them down.

1201
01:38:53.042 --> 01:38:55.628
Do your... Do your stuff.

1202
01:38:55.795 --> 01:38:59.757
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1203
01:39:00.674 --> 01:39:03.636
Uh... I don't know. A matter of minutes.

1204
01:39:03.803 --> 01:39:07.097
You want us to coordinate
a worldwide counterstrike...

1205
01:39:07.264 --> 01:39:09.141
...with a window of a few minutes?

1206
01:39:09.308 --> 01:39:12.770
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1207
01:39:12.937 --> 01:39:16.649
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1208
01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:19.235
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan...

1209
01:39:19.401 --> 01:39:23.155
...depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1210
01:39:23.823 --> 01:39:25.825
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1211
01:39:25.991 --> 01:39:29.829
I've seen them in action.
l'm aware of their maneuvering capabilities.

1212
01:39:30.663 --> 01:39:34.124
With your permission, general,
l'd like the opportunity to try.

1213
01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:37.294
That thing is a wreck.

1214
01:39:37.461 --> 01:39:39.463
It crash-landed back in the '50s.

1215
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:41.924
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1216
01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:44.510
Jim, uh ... remove the clamps.

1217
01:40:06.991 --> 01:40:08.492
Any questions?

1218
01:40:13.372 --> 01:40:15.249
Let's do it.

1219
01:40:18.586 --> 01:40:20.337
All right, you heard the president...

1220
01:40:20.504 --> 01:40:23.883
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

1221
01:40:24.049 --> 01:40:26.135
A virus.

1222
01:40:26.594 --> 01:40:28.470
Your idea.

1223
01:40:28.637 --> 01:40:30.681
That's right.

1224
01:40:36.395 --> 01:40:39.356
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1225
01:40:39.523 --> 01:40:43.027
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1226
01:40:50.409 --> 01:40:51.493
Whoo!

1227
01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.246
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1228
01:40:54.413 --> 01:40:57.249
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1229
01:40:57.416 --> 01:41:01.921
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1230
01:41:02.087 --> 01:41:04.840
- You don't understand !
- However...

1231
01:41:05.007 --> 01:41:08.594
...that is one mistake l am thankful to say
that l don't have to live with.

1232
01:41:08.761 --> 01:41:10.763
- Mr. President...
- Mr. Nimziki...

1233
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.348
...you're fired.

1234
01:41:15.935 --> 01:41:20.022
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

1235
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:21.440
Yes, sir.

1236
01:41:21.607 --> 01:41:23.150
He can't do that.

1237
01:41:23.317 --> 01:41:26.111
Well, he just, uh ... did.

1238
01:41:29.949 --> 01:41:34.286
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1239
01:41:34.453 --> 01:41:37.247
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1240
01:41:37.414 --> 01:41:41.460
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1241
01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:48.634
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal . Old Morse code.

1242
01:42:01.563 --> 01:42:03.649
It's from the Americans.

1243
01:42:05.025 --> 01:42:07.277
They want to organize a counteroffensive!

1244
01:42:07.444 --> 01:42:10.447
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1245
01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.931
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions...

1246
01:42:36.098 --> 01:42:41.228
- ...in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- l mpressive. Considering it's all done with ...

1247
01:42:41.395 --> 01:42:42.688
Morse code.

1248
01:42:43.147 --> 01:42:46.817
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1249
01:42:46.984 --> 01:42:50.195
- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.

1250
01:42:50.362 --> 01:42:52.281
Well, then, find them.

1251
01:42:52.448 --> 01:42:56.952
<i>Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding...</i>

1252
01:42:57.119 --> 01:43:01.331
<i>...unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...</i>

1253
01:43:02.332 --> 01:43:04.752
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1254
01:43:04.918 --> 01:43:06.503
With our depleted manpower...

1255
01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:09.965
...we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1256
01:43:10.132 --> 01:43:15.137
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1257
01:43:16.013 --> 01:43:18.474
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1258
01:43:21.143 --> 01:43:22.895
All right, guys! Listen up!

1259
01:43:23.062 --> 01:43:26.857
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1260
01:43:27.024 --> 01:43:29.193
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression ...

1261
01:43:29.359 --> 01:43:32.196
...but this is a crash course
in modern avionics.

1262
01:43:32.362 --> 01:43:34.907
- Keep it coming.
- Okay, you got it!

1263
01:43:35.074 --> 01:43:37.242
All right, listen up. Before we begin ...

1264
01:43:37.409 --> 01:43:40.662
...we need some background information
on your experience.

1265
01:43:40.829 --> 01:43:42.831
Let's start with you.

1266
01:43:42.998 --> 01:43:44.208
Who, me?

1267
01:43:46.085 --> 01:43:48.504
Well, l'm, uh, Russell Casse, sir.

1268
01:43:49.797 --> 01:43:53.842
And, uh ... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1269
01:43:54.551 --> 01:43:57.179
And, uh... been doing that ever since.

1270
01:43:57.721 --> 01:44:02.142
On a personal note, sir,
l'd just like to add that, uh...

1271
01:44:02.643 --> 01:44:06.522
...ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago...

1272
01:44:06.688 --> 01:44:08.607
...I have been dying for some payback.

1273
01:44:08.774 --> 01:44:13.028
I just want you to know
that, uh... I won't let you down.

1274
01:44:14.571 --> 01:44:16.615
You have one tactical nuclear missile...

1275
01:44:16.782 --> 01:44:20.035
...we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1276
01:44:20.202 --> 01:44:22.121
This is the firing mechanism.

1277
01:44:22.287 --> 01:44:24.832
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1278
01:44:24.998 --> 01:44:27.126
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1279
01:44:27.292 --> 01:44:29.878
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1280
01:44:30.963 --> 01:44:33.882
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1281
01:44:34.883 --> 01:44:36.510
Good luck, gentlemen.

1282
01:44:37.553 --> 01:44:38.929
30 seconds.

1283
01:44:39.096 --> 01:44:43.267
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
lt'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1284
01:44:43.433 --> 01:44:46.311
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1285
01:44:46.478 --> 01:44:50.190
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1286
01:44:51.859 --> 01:44:53.944
Why you? David!

1287
01:44:54.361 --> 01:44:56.905
I don't... l don't understand ...

1288
01:44:57.072 --> 01:45:00.742
...why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1289
01:45:00.909 --> 01:45:02.619
No, no. Something may go wrong.

1290
01:45:02.786 --> 01:45:05.622
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1291
01:45:05.789 --> 01:45:09.459
Who knows? Hey, you know how
l'm always trying to save the planet?

1292
01:45:14.256 --> 01:45:16.341
Here's my chance.

1293
01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.762
Now he gets ambitious.

1294
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:24.183
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1295
01:45:24.349 --> 01:45:27.102
Okay. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1296
01:45:27.269 --> 01:45:29.354
So. How do I look?

1297
01:45:30.564 --> 01:45:33.150
Oh, thank you . You're a lot of help.

1298
01:45:35.277 --> 01:45:38.322
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1299
01:45:38.488 --> 01:45:41.366
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1300
01:45:42.034 --> 01:45:45.704
Listen . Before we do this,
I just wanna say l'm sorry.

1301
01:45:45.871 --> 01:45:47.956
Sorry for what, babe?

1302
01:45:48.624 --> 01:45:51.793
I should have done this a long time ago.

1303
01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:55.297
- Do you have the ring?
- Uh ... Yes, sir.

1304
01:45:55.464 --> 01:45:58.383
- Here, make yourself useful.
- Ow!

1305
01:46:00.844 --> 01:46:01.845
Witnesses?

1306
01:46:02.012 --> 01:46:04.056
Um...

1307
01:46:05.015 --> 01:46:08.977
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1308
01:46:09.144 --> 01:46:12.898
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God ...

1309
01:46:13.065 --> 01:46:15.859
...and in the presence of these witnesses...

1310
01:46:16.026 --> 01:46:18.946
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1311
01:46:19.112 --> 01:46:23.033
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed ...

1312
01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.703
...please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1313
01:46:29.248 --> 01:46:32.834
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife...

1314
01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:36.046
...to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1315
01:46:36.922 --> 01:46:41.677
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1316
01:46:41.843 --> 01:46:44.096
...and, forsaking all others...

1317
01:46:44.263 --> 01:46:48.225
...keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1318
01:46:48.684 --> 01:46:50.769
I will.

1319
01:46:51.645 --> 01:46:53.021
Whoo!

1320
01:47:02.155 --> 01:47:04.241
Good morning.

1321
01:47:07.744 --> 01:47:09.830
They're a little young.

1322
01:47:10.497 --> 01:47:12.582
That they are.

1323
01:47:13.834 --> 01:47:15.919
They look a little nervous.

1324
01:47:16.461 --> 01:47:19.673
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1325
01:47:21.049 --> 01:47:23.802
- Major. Can l borrow that?
- Sir.

1326
01:47:25.262 --> 01:47:26.930
Good morning.

1327
01:47:28.598 --> 01:47:30.100
Good morning.

1328
01:47:32.936 --> 01:47:35.230
In less than an hour...

1329
01:47:35.397 --> 01:47:40.027
...aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1330
01:47:40.193 --> 01:47:45.741
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1331
01:47:47.576 --> 01:47:48.618
Mankind.

1332
01:47:48.785 --> 01:47:52.622
That... word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1333
01:47:54.166 --> 01:47:57.377
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1334
01:47:59.338 --> 01:48:02.049
We will be united in our common interest.

1335
01:48:02.883 --> 01:48:06.928
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1336
01:48:08.138 --> 01:48:11.433
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1337
01:48:12.726 --> 01:48:15.937
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1338
01:48:18.523 --> 01:48:20.609
But from annihilation.

1339
01:48:21.568 --> 01:48:23.904
We're fighting for our right to live.

1340
01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:26.990
To exist.

1341
01:48:28.158 --> 01:48:30.243
And should we win the day...

1342
01:48:31.119 --> 01:48:35.457
...the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday...

1343
01:48:36.625 --> 01:48:39.628
...but as the day
when the world declared in one voice...

1344
01:48:39.795 --> 01:48:42.255
..."We will not go quietly into the night!"

1345
01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:46.051
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

1346
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:49.096
"We're going to live on!"

1347
01:48:49.679 --> 01:48:51.765
"We're going to survive!"

1348
01:48:52.557 --> 01:48:56.603
Today, we celebrate our lndependence Day!

1349
01:48:59.481 --> 01:49:00.690
Yeah!

1350
01:49:21.586 --> 01:49:24.256
- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

1351
01:49:24.756 --> 01:49:26.925
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1352
01:49:27.092 --> 01:49:31.388
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here.
You've got your choice of helmets.

1353
01:49:34.182 --> 01:49:36.685
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1354
01:49:37.227 --> 01:49:39.396
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1355
01:49:41.648 --> 01:49:43.817
I belong in the air.

1356
01:49:50.365 --> 01:49:52.993
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1357
01:49:56.246 --> 01:49:59.416
As soon as l get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1358
01:50:07.132 --> 01:50:09.468
Here. Take these.

1359
01:50:13.138 --> 01:50:14.764
Just in case.

1360
01:50:15.182 --> 01:50:16.516
Where's... Where's...

1361
01:50:27.569 --> 01:50:29.362
Just in case.

1362
01:50:31.823 --> 01:50:33.658
I'm very proud of you.

1363
01:50:45.504 --> 01:50:47.672
Be careful, okay?

1364
01:50:54.137 --> 01:50:55.555
It's time.

1365
01:51:01.102 --> 01:51:02.354
I love you.

1366
01:51:02.729 --> 01:51:04.481
I love you.

1367
01:51:09.528 --> 01:51:12.030
Oh, damn! Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1368
01:51:12.197 --> 01:51:14.950
- We gotta find some cigars. l can't...
- Here! Here!

1369
01:51:15.116 --> 01:51:17.160
Take these. My last two.

1370
01:51:18.119 --> 01:51:20.372
You are a lifesaver.

1371
01:51:20.872 --> 01:51:23.333
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing !

1372
01:51:51.111 --> 01:51:53.321
<i>- Missile launch.</i>
- Oh, crap!

1373
01:51:53.989 --> 01:51:55.574
What do I hit? Which one?

1374
01:51:57.826 --> 01:52:00.537
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.

1375
01:52:15.885 --> 01:52:18.179
This is our victory dance.

1376
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:20.432
Not until the fat lady sings.

1377
01:52:20.599 --> 01:52:23.101
Oh . Yes, okay.

1378
01:52:23.268 --> 01:52:24.603
This is important.

1379
01:52:24.769 --> 01:52:27.230
Fat lady. I gotcha.

1380
01:52:29.232 --> 01:52:31.276
Open launch tunnel.

1381
01:52:50.795 --> 01:52:53.632
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1382
01:52:53.798 --> 01:52:56.551
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.

1383
01:52:56.718 --> 01:52:58.136
Yeah. Is it?

1384
01:53:01.806 --> 01:53:03.141
Let's rock 'n' roll.

1385
01:53:05.602 --> 01:53:06.770
Oh!

1386
01:53:09.814 --> 01:53:11.024
Oops.

1387
01:53:11.191 --> 01:53:13.360
Oops? What does that mean?

1388
01:53:13.526 --> 01:53:16.446
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1389
01:53:16.613 --> 01:53:19.449
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1390
01:53:19.616 --> 01:53:22.077
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1391
01:53:22.577 --> 01:53:24.996
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

1392
01:53:25.163 --> 01:53:26.706
Thataway!

1393
01:53:33.713 --> 01:53:36.007
I have got to get me one of these!

1394
01:53:44.974 --> 01:53:49.521
- No, no. What was that? Don't do that!
- Just trying to get a feel for the old girl.

1395
01:53:49.688 --> 01:53:51.523
No, no, don't. Leave her alone.

1396
01:53:52.107 --> 01:53:54.025
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!

1397
01:53:58.530 --> 01:54:01.074
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1398
01:54:01.241 --> 01:54:04.577
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1399
01:54:04.744 --> 01:54:07.497
<i>- Which way they headed?</i>
- l think our secret's out.

1400
01:54:07.664 --> 01:54:09.416
They're headed straight for us.

1401
01:54:09.582 --> 01:54:12.043
<i>ETA, 26 minutes.</i>

1402
01:54:15.213 --> 01:54:17.006
You still with me over there?

1403
01:54:17.173 --> 01:54:20.093
What the hell was l thinking? Oh!

1404
01:54:30.437 --> 01:54:33.231
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1405
01:54:44.743 --> 01:54:46.870
Head straight for it.

1406
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:55.086
- What the hell ...?
- Don't touch them. Don't, don't!

1407
01:54:55.253 --> 01:54:56.838
I was counting on this.

1408
01:54:57.005 --> 01:54:59.090
They are bringing us in.

1409
01:55:00.049 --> 01:55:03.928
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1410
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:08.433
We've got to work on our communication.

1411
01:55:23.448 --> 01:55:25.575
We have visual.

1412
01:55:25.742 --> 01:55:27.827
Do not engage until we've confirmed ...

1413
01:55:27.994 --> 01:55:30.121
<i>- .. the package has been delivered.</i>
- Roger.

1414
01:55:35.627 --> 01:55:38.296
Major, what happens if that thing gets here...

1415
01:55:38.838 --> 01:55:40.965
...before the virus is planted?

1416
01:55:41.132 --> 01:55:43.676
This facility's buried
deep within a mountain.

1417
01:55:43.843 --> 01:55:46.679
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1418
01:55:46.846 --> 01:55:48.932
What about the people outside?

1419
01:55:56.648 --> 01:55:58.817
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1420
01:56:58.209 --> 01:56:59.669
Oh, my God.

1421
01:57:32.827 --> 01:57:34.245
Look at that.

1422
01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:45.965
There must be thousands of them.

1423
01:57:46.132 --> 01:57:48.760
Millions of them . What the hell are they doing?

1424
01:57:49.594 --> 01:57:51.930
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1425
01:58:19.457 --> 01:58:22.377
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1426
01:58:22.543 --> 01:58:24.504
No, no. This thing comes fully loaded.

1427
01:58:24.671 --> 01:58:27.548
AMIFM radio, reclining bucket seats and ...

1428
01:58:27.715 --> 01:58:29.759
...power windows.

1429
01:58:45.525 --> 01:58:47.151
Come on, baby.

1430
01:58:49.612 --> 01:58:51.656
We're in.

1431
01:58:56.953 --> 01:58:58.705
Do it. Do it.

1432
01:58:58.997 --> 01:59:00.164
Do it.

1433
01:59:00.331 --> 01:59:02.542
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1434
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:04.836
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1435
01:59:05.003 --> 01:59:07.046
<i>Stand by to engage.</i>

1436
01:59:08.464 --> 01:59:10.675
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1437
01:59:14.846 --> 01:59:17.056
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1438
01:59:17.223 --> 01:59:19.434
We need you to grab everything you can.

1439
01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.479
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1440
01:59:26.566 --> 01:59:28.192
The virus is in.

1441
01:59:34.032 --> 01:59:36.826
All we can do now is... pray.

1442
01:59:37.869 --> 01:59:41.581
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!

1443
01:59:41.748 --> 01:59:44.042
Eagle One. Fox three.

1444
01:59:48.171 --> 01:59:49.881
Gentlemen, this is it.

1445
01:59:53.259 --> 01:59:55.053
Come on, come on, come on.

1446
02:00:08.066 --> 02:00:09.901
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1447
02:00:10.068 --> 02:00:11.903
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.

1448
02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:14.113
<i>Rear flank, follow suit-</i>

1449
02:00:15.406 --> 02:00:17.992
Hold on, Command.

1450
02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:21.579
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1451
02:00:21.746 --> 02:00:25.374
Eagle One. Fox three.

1452
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:42.266
- Direct hit!
- It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will !

1453
02:00:42.433 --> 02:00:43.810
Fire at will !

1454
02:00:43.976 --> 02:00:46.729
We're going in. Squadron leaders, take flight.

1455
02:00:48.314 --> 02:00:50.149
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1456
02:00:50.316 --> 02:00:52.276
Eagle One. Fox two.

1457
02:00:52.443 --> 02:00:53.945
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1458
02:01:02.912 --> 02:01:06.249
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1459
02:01:06.833 --> 02:01:08.334
Prepare to engage!

1460
02:01:13.297 --> 02:01:16.634
All right, Mr. President! Here we go!

1461
02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:18.803
All right, baby. l've gotcha!

1462
02:01:20.847 --> 02:01:23.141
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

1463
02:01:25.101 --> 02:01:27.353
Okay. Job's done. Let's go home.

1464
02:01:27.854 --> 02:01:29.647
Gladly.

1465
02:01:33.151 --> 02:01:34.277
What's up?

1466
02:01:34.819 --> 02:01:35.987
It's stuck.

1467
02:01:36.154 --> 02:01:38.197
- What?
- It's not responding. lt's stuck.

1468
02:01:38.364 --> 02:01:39.657
Try it again.

1469
02:01:54.505 --> 02:01:56.841
Come on, come on!

1470
02:02:13.107 --> 02:02:14.901
Come on, come on! Inside!

1471
02:02:15.067 --> 02:02:18.029
- Go to the elevator!
- Hurry!

1472
02:02:29.248 --> 02:02:30.833
Steve! Steve!

1473
02:02:36.714 --> 02:02:39.300
- What are you doing?
- They're overriding the system.

1474
02:02:40.218 --> 02:02:41.719
Oh, shit!

1475
02:02:41.886 --> 02:02:43.846
Um... Hide.

1476
02:02:49.908 --> 02:02:52.411
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1477
02:02:53.287 --> 02:02:54.454
Come on in.

1478
02:02:58.208 --> 02:02:59.668
I'm not Jewish.

1479
02:03:00.168 --> 02:03:01.920
Nobody's perfect.

1480
02:03:04.673 --> 02:03:06.758
Are you scared?

1481
02:03:07.092 --> 02:03:08.093
Me, too.

1482
02:03:10.095 --> 02:03:12.055
- Eagle Seven, fox two.
- Eagle Three, fox two.

1483
02:03:20.132 --> 02:03:23.719
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.

1484
02:03:23.886 --> 02:03:25.470
It's directly over us.

1485
02:03:34.646 --> 02:03:36.982
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon !

1486
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:39.651
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.

1487
02:03:45.115 --> 02:03:46.992
Target at 12 o'clock!

1488
02:03:49.119 --> 02:03:50.662
My God! They're everywhere!

1489
02:03:52.247 --> 02:03:54.625
- Bandits on our tail ! Locked on!
- I see them.

1490
02:03:58.003 --> 02:04:00.297
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1491
02:04:01.965 --> 02:04:04.509
You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!

1492
02:04:07.888 --> 02:04:10.390
I'm in range. Locking on.

1493
02:04:11.016 --> 02:04:13.477
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1494
02:04:23.362 --> 02:04:25.030
That is a negative impact.

1495
02:04:25.197 --> 02:04:27.324
<i>That is an Nl. Negative impact.</i>

1496
02:04:27.991 --> 02:04:30.285
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1497
02:04:30.452 --> 02:04:31.995
I'm on it.

1498
02:04:34.414 --> 02:04:36.041
Oh, Jesus!

1499
02:04:38.335 --> 02:04:41.922
- Sir, all missiles have been fired.
- Out of time! Get your ass out of there!

1500
02:04:42.089 --> 02:04:44.466
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1501
02:04:44.633 --> 02:04:46.551
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1502
02:04:46.718 --> 02:04:48.845
<i>Sorry l'm late, Mr. President!</i>

1503
02:04:52.641 --> 02:04:54.017
I got hung up back there!

1504
02:04:54.184 --> 02:04:57.479
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1505
02:04:57.646 --> 02:04:59.147
I'm packing!

1506
02:05:00.565 --> 02:05:02.693
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1507
02:05:02.859 --> 02:05:05.112
- Pilot, identify yourself.
<i>- lt's me!</i>

1508
02:05:05.278 --> 02:05:06.905
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>

1509
02:05:07.698 --> 02:05:09.700
I told you l wouldn't let you down!

1510
02:05:09.866 --> 02:05:12.911
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>

1511
02:05:13.078 --> 02:05:18.208
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take
flanking positions. Look after this guy, okay?

1512
02:05:18.667 --> 02:05:22.713
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1513
02:05:22.879 --> 02:05:25.090
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!

1514
02:05:33.056 --> 02:05:35.017
We'll draw them <i>off</i> and it's all yours!

1515
02:05:35.642 --> 02:05:38.270
Oh-ho! Look out! Coming through!

1516
02:05:39.896 --> 02:05:41.314
I've got tone.

1517
02:05:43.442 --> 02:05:45.986
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1518
02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.995
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1519
02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:59.666
It's jammed.

1520
02:06:00.667 --> 02:06:02.502
<i>It won't fire-</i>

1521
02:06:05.630 --> 02:06:07.090
Damn it!

1522
02:06:17.809 --> 02:06:19.895
Do me a favor.

1523
02:06:21.855 --> 02:06:25.692
Tell my children ... I love them very much.

1524
02:06:28.737 --> 02:06:30.947
All right, you alien assholes!

1525
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:34.576
In the words of my generation...

1526
02:06:34.743 --> 02:06:38.622
...up yours!

1527
02:06:39.206 --> 02:06:40.582
Dad! What's he doing?

1528
02:06:40.749 --> 02:06:42.000
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

1529
02:06:42.167 --> 02:06:44.252
Come on, baby, come on!

1530
02:06:47.255 --> 02:06:48.632
Good luck, buddy.

1531
02:06:55.555 --> 02:07:01.353
Hello, boys! l'm back!

1532
02:07:22.374 --> 02:07:24.167
He did it!

1533
02:07:24.334 --> 02:07:26.336
The son of a bitch did it!

1534
02:07:29.339 --> 02:07:30.549
All right!

1535
02:07:53.029 --> 02:07:55.073
What your father did was very brave.

1536
02:07:56.908 --> 02:07:58.743
You should be proud of him.

1537
02:07:59.452 --> 02:08:01.037
I am.

1538
02:08:18.763 --> 02:08:22.976
We know how to take them out, general.
Spread the word.

1539
02:08:25.979 --> 02:08:29.441
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1540
02:08:29.608 --> 02:08:32.861
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1541
02:08:46.625 --> 02:08:48.084
What do you think?

1542
02:08:49.127 --> 02:08:51.504
Checkmate.

1543
02:09:16.947 --> 02:09:20.450
Well, it's funny. l always thought
things like these would kill me.

1544
02:09:24.704 --> 02:09:26.164
Thank you.

1545
02:09:33.964 --> 02:09:35.548
It's been a pleasure.

1546
02:09:36.508 --> 02:09:38.468
Steve, you too.

1547
02:09:42.514 --> 02:09:44.349
Only one thing left to do.

1548
02:09:50.146 --> 02:09:51.856
Ready?

1549
02:09:52.023 --> 02:09:53.692
Yes, sir.

1550
02:10:00.073 --> 02:10:03.201
Hey, all right! Look at us!

1551
02:10:03.368 --> 02:10:06.705
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1552
02:10:06.871 --> 02:10:09.874
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for you!
- Goodbye!

1553
02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:14.045
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1554
02:10:14.212 --> 02:10:16.589
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!

1555
02:10:23.805 --> 02:10:24.848
Peace!

1556
02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:41.281
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?

1557
02:10:41.448 --> 02:10:42.782
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1558
02:10:42.949 --> 02:10:45.493
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us out of here!

1559
02:10:53.418 --> 02:10:55.879
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?

1560
02:11:04.304 --> 02:11:08.099
- Oh, that was a hit. l took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving !

1561
02:11:11.936 --> 02:11:14.272
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel ! Exit left!

1562
02:11:14.439 --> 02:11:17.275
- Where the hell do you think l'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...

1563
02:11:36.044 --> 02:11:38.296
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!

1564
02:11:38.463 --> 02:11:41.800
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1565
02:11:41.966 --> 02:11:44.260
Aah!

1566
02:11:53.478 --> 02:11:54.813
Oh!

1567
02:11:54.979 --> 02:11:57.065
Elvis has left the building!

1568
02:11:57.232 --> 02:11:59.234
Thank you very much.

1569
02:11:59.401 --> 02:12:01.486
Oh, I love you, man.

1570
02:13:32.410 --> 02:13:35.663
They're going down all over the world, Tom.
We got them beat.

1571
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:38.583
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1572
02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:47.926
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1573
02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.763
Hold it!

1574
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:55.099
Hold on, sir. l've got something on radar.

1575
02:14:42.313 --> 02:14:44.232
Sorry, sir.

1576
02:14:44.983 --> 02:14:46.234
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1577
02:14:46.401 --> 02:14:49.153
- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1578
02:14:56.661 --> 02:14:57.787
David...

1579
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:02.000
Not bad.

1580
02:15:05.169 --> 02:15:07.839
Thank you, Mr. President.

1581
02:15:08.673 --> 02:15:10.508
Not too bad at all.

1582
02:15:11.676 --> 02:15:13.803
Oh, so this is healthy?

1583
02:15:14.262 --> 02:15:16.347
Oh... l could get used to it.

1584
02:15:34.198 --> 02:15:36.743
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1585
02:15:36.909 --> 02:15:38.995
Same to you, Munchkin.

1586
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:43.166
Didn't l promise you fireworks?

1587
02:15:43.333 --> 02:15:44.709
Yeah.
