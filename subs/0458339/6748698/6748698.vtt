It's really not that surprising.

9
00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.759
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.927
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:36.387
I don't think so.

12
00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:38.514
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

13
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.267
How long before
we can start craning it out?

Just one?

343
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.066

344

I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

345

This is from Augsburg. My city.

346
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:00.790
So many people forget

347
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.418
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

348
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:07.505
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

349
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.508
They felt weak. They felt small.

350
00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:12.343
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

<font color="#ff6a6a">[STAMMERING]</font>

And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.187
And he says, "You."

354
00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:24.939
He says, "You will make us strong."

355
00:25:25.608 --> 00:25:28.276
Well, I am not interested.

356
00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:32.113
So he sends the head of Hydra,

357

his research division.

358
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:37.452
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

359
00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:40.121
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

360
00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:41.539
And he is ambitious.

361
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:47.295
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

362
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:51.007
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

363
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:52.884
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

364
00:25:53.344 --> 00:25:56.387
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

365
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:59.015
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

366
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:00.350
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

367
00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:03.311
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

368
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:08.858
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

369
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.489
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

370
00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:21.329
Did it make him stronger?

371
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:22.747
Yes.

372
00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:26.084
But there were other effects.

373
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:31.673
The serum was not ready.

374
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:35.885
But more important, the man.

375
00:26:36.845 --> 00:26:39.097
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

376
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:42.350
so good becomes great.

377
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.185
Bad becomes worse.

378
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.067
This is why you were chosen.

379
00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:55.738
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

380
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:57.782
may lose respect for that power,

381
00:26:57.866 --> 00:27:01.035
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

382
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:03.413
And knows

383
00:27:03.914 --> 00:27:05.248
compassion.

384
00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:11.212

Let me show you.

579
00:44:05.184 --> 00:44:07.853
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

580
00:44:07.937 --> 00:44:09.855
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

581

His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

582
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:17.446
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

583
00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:21.074
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

your confusion.

Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:33.253

to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

587
00:44:33.463 --> 00:44:36.757

how many forces they possess,

every hostile capital on Earth.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.120
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

1006
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.538
Sounds good.

1007
01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.962
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

1008
01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.380
You don't like music?

1009
01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:11.882
I do, actually.

1010
01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:17.137
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

1011
01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.805
Then what are we waiting for?

1012
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.308
The right partner.

1013
01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.727
0800, Captain.

1014
01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:27.230
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

1015
01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:29.149
I'm invisible.

1016
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.736
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

1017
01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:36.406
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

1018
01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.744
<font color="#5197ff">HOWARD:</font>
Emission signature is unusual.

1019
01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.246
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

1020
01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:47.083
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

1021
01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:50.086
Seems harmless enough.

1022
01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.340
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1023
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.184
Write that down.

1024
01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:08.855
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

1025
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.024
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1026
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.615
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

1027
01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.290
I read about what you did.

1028
01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.376
Oh, the... Yeah.

1029
01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.711
Well, that's, you know.

1030
01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:34.756
Just doing what needed to be done.

1031
01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:37.926
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

1032
01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.226
Really, it's not a big deal.

1033
01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.271
Tell that to their wives.

1034
01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:52.440
Uh,

1035
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.234
I don't think they were all married.

1036
01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:55.986
You're a hero.

1037
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.571
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

1038
01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.992
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

1039
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.162
And seeing as they're not here...

1040
01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:15.797
Captain!

1041
01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.550
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

1042
01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.177
Agent Carter, wait.

1043
01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:23.596
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

1044
01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.265
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

1045
01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:28.018
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

1046
01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:31.938
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

1047
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.273
Well, what about you and Stark?

1048
01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.859
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

1049
01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:43.116
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

1050
01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.703
<i><font color="#5197ff">HOWARD:</font> Fondue is just
cheese and bread, my friend.</i>

1051
01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:49.622
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

1052
01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.708
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

1053
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:54.169
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

1054
01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.963
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

1055
01:17:57.048 --> 01:17:59.883
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

1056
01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.885
Carbon polymer.

1057
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.888
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

1058
01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:08.475
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

1059
01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:11.561
I hear you're kind of attached.

1060
01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.063
It's handier than you might think.

1061
01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:15.315
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

1062
01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.067
This one's fun.

1063
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.403
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

1064
01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:22.072
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

1065
01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:24.324
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

1066
01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:28.078
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

1067
01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.498
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1068
01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.043
How come it's not standard issue?

1069
01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.503
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1070
01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.254
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

1071
01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:40.548
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1072
01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.509
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

1073
01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:44.511
What do you think?

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.784

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:31.427
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

1131
01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:36.440
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

1132

1133

Why not?

1134
01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:43.114
It disagrees with me.

1135
01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.117
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1136
01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:52.206
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1137
01:26:52.291 --> 01:26:57.128
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1138
01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.965
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1139
01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.552
You want to live.

1140
01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:08.055
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1141
01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.308
I bought you dinner.

1142
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.649
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1143
01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:22.987
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1144
01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:26.198
"Dr Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1145
01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:30.328
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1146
01:27:30.996 --> 01:27:34.582
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1147
01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.667
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1148
01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:40.338
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1149
01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:42.757
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1150
01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:48.220
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1151
01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:51.349
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1152
01:27:52.017 --> 01:27:54.685
It's you or Schmidt.

1153
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.355
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1154
01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:03.069
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1155
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:04.695
Hmm.

1156
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.573
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1157
01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.909
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1158
01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.035
What?

1159
01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:14.205
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1160
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.457
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1161
01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.459
What's his target?

1162
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.088
His target

1163
01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.715
is everywhere.

1164
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.238
Tomorrow,

1165
01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:51.242
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1166
01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:54.495
borne to victory on the wings
<i>of the Valkyrie.</i>

1167
01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:59.583
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1168
01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:05.172
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1169
01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:12.096
If they cut off one head,

1170
01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.349
two more shall take its place.

1171
01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.018

Dr. Erskine said that

1180
01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.644
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1181
01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:02.813
it would affect my cells.

1182
01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:07.651
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1183
01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.403

Did you know that?

1186

Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

You did everything you could.

1192
01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.106

1194
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.236

Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1201

half the world to prove it,

1202

1203

Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1204
01:31:20.267 --> 01:31:22.017
He gets across the Atlantic,

1205
01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.562

the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1207

<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1335
01:51:56.085 --> 01:51:59.379
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1336
01:51:59.463 --> 01:52:00.797
Where am I really?

1337
01:52:02.091 --> 01:52:04.092
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1338
01:52:04.802 --> 01:52:06.135
The game.

1339
01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:09.263
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1340
01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:15.269
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1341
01:52:15.813 --> 01:52:16.813
Where am I?

1342
01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:19.482
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1348
01:53:06.363 --> 01:53:09.282
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1349
01:53:10.534 --> 01:53:13.536
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1350
01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:15.037
Break what?

1351
01:53:17.499 --> 01:53:19.167
You've been asleep, Cap.

1352
01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.711
For almost 70 years.

1353
01:53:36.226 --> 01:53:37.518
You gonna be okay?

1354
01:53:38.562 --> 01:53:39.687
Yeah.

1355
01:53:40.022 --> 01:53:41.355
Yeah, I just...

1356
01:53:44.735 --> 01:53:46.068
I had a date.

You're here with a mission, sir?

I am.

1361
02:03:16.431 --> 02:03:18.265
Trying to get me back in the world?

1362
02:03:19.476 --> 02:03:20.726
Trying to save it.

You're up.

1366
02:03:54.719 --> 02:03:55.761
Got a mean swing.
