1
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,711
I need 11 copies of each
by tomorrow morning...

2
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,991
...and before my
macchiato goes arctic.

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,760
Assistants just don't have
the stamina they used to have.

4
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,531
Excuse me, Miss Lake. With all
due respect, I'm not an assistant.

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,526
I'm a reporter.

6
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,911
Of course you are.

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,128
Unfortunately...

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,377
...Sullivan...

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,814
...what matters is that I can see
Gotham from my new office...

10
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:50,438
...and you... Oh, well, you, hon,
you work below sea level.

11
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,992
At the risk of heresy, I would rather be
snorkeling for the rest of my life...

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:00,396
...than destroy a
man's career based on rumor.

13
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,566
I only print the truth.
And if you haven't noticed...

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,330
...I print it on page
one, section B, every week.

15
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:19,715
Ron, I know for a fact that this
guy's on steroids. He's a juicer.

16
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,419
I can smell the slow-roasting ink
of tomorrow's headline.

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,956
Well, you said you wanted someone
with their finger on the pulse...

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,180
...of the city.
Well, I just hit an artery.

19
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,080
Well, if it isn't
the steroid stallion.

20
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,837
What? Don't you have some
muscle-cocktail mixing to do?

21
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,969
You ruined my life.

22
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,243
And you don't
even care, do you?

23
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,547
Oh, please, if you didn't wanna get
Red Rovered by the Meteors...

24
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,017
...maybe you should've reconsidered
jamming that needle into your tush.

25
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,119
You're pretty quick
to get high and mighty.

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,655
I think those aminos
are going to your head.

27
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,892
And I think you've
destroyed enough lives.

28
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,736
I'm not gonna let
you destroy any more.

29
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,811
So I'm guessing you didn't ditch
prime time on your social calendar...

30
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,048
...to come and help me research
the dwindling pigeon population.

31
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,544
Chloe, Lex proposed.

32
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,005
And?

33
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,585
And I haven't
given him an answer yet.

34
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,762
I'm sure that's
going over well.

35
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:59,206
Yeah, Lex and I are in a really
great place right now...

36
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,637
...but when I actually
heard those words...

37
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,581
...there was something
that wouldn't let me say yes.

38
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,134
Something like Clark?

39
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,577
When I was with Clark...

40
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,548
...I would've said
yes without hesitating.

41
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,348
I thought that
chapter of my life was over.

42
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,058
Lana...

43
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,902
...I think that you need to
stop reading between the lines...

44
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,737
...and actually talk to Clark.

45
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:40,661
Before you're gonna be able
to close this book on him forever.

46
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,178
Let's go.

47
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,566
Scoopgirl?
- Hotshot485?

48
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,182
You've gotta be kidding me.

49
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,819
I'm not the one up all night tooling
the Internet for Green Arrow pics.

50
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,443
Don't you have a boyfriend?

51
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,258
Do you have the photos?

52
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,022
You got the cash?

53
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,398
I don't get it. Of all
the photographers in Metropolis...

54
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,635
...how is that you end up with
the first shots of our merry archer?

55
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,799
I have my connections.

56
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,863
No, really.

57
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,576
Oh, well, the guy doesn't get out
of the Suicide Slums much.

58
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,979
So I just hung out there
for a few weeks.

59
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,915
In my car, with my pepper spray,
and the doors locked...

60
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,352
This is it? A
bunch of arms and legs?

61
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,987
Nice work, hotshot.

62
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,625
I mean, you didn't even manage
to catch one shot of his face.

63
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,769
All these tell me about Green Arrow
is that he needs a Band-Aid.

64
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,317
Well, at least you
got a good look at that.

65
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,126
Thanks.

66
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,774
Hey, Chloe.

67
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,319
<i>Have you seen the
Daily Planet this morning?</i>

68
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,643
No.

69
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,915
Okay.

70
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:39,054
God, I can't let you
read this in the paper.

71
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,146
Lex proposed to Lana.

72
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,881
What'd she say?

73
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,510
She hasn't given him an answer.

74
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,293
It says here it's because of me.

75
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,311
This is true?

76
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,108
Chloe?

77
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,283
I know better...

78
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,569
Look, I know better.

79
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:27,215
You know, I tried so hard
to let Lana go that...

80
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,832
If she marries Lex,
there's no going back.

81
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,148
Is it true?

82
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:48,101
I would double down on the fact
that Lana's still in love with you.

83
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,667
I can't let her do this.
- Clark, wait a minute.

84
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,036
It's a lot more
complicated now.

85
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,220
What could be more complicated
than living your life with regrets?

86
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,886
You didn't have to do that.

87
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,240
I was feeling alone
waiting for your answer.

88
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,084
I didn't realize I
had so much company.

89
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,702
I don't know what to say.

90
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,208
Then let me.

91
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,285
"When I was with Clark...

92
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,853
...I would have said yes
without hesitating."

93
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,402
You know, the
worst part of waiting...

94
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:05,941
...was dwelling on all the reasons
why you might be stalling.

95
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,096
At least now I know.

96
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,973
Lex, I'm sorry.

97
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,631
Mr. Luthor, you have a guest.

98
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,819
They said Lana was here.
- She was.

99
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,889
But I'm afraid
you just missed her.

100
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,257
I'll come back later.

101
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,960
So you really think
you can convince her?

102
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,362
You think you can talk her
out of making...

103
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,998
...the biggest mistake
of her life by marrying me?

104
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:08,403
We both know that you swept in after...
- After you crushed her?

105
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,872
You knew she was vulnerable.

106
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,875
And you played her until she thought
she was in love with you.

107
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,843
If you really see
Lana as that naive...

108
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,913
...you obviously don't
think as much of her as I do.

109
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,216
It must be eating at you
that she's hesitating...

110
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,780
...wondering why she hasn't
given you an answer.

111
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,126
I guess it would.

112
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,088
If I didn't know what
the answer was gonna be.

113
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,687
You see, I highly doubt
she'll say no, Clark.

114
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,619
Now that she's
carrying my child.

115
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,358
So you're telling me...

116
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:07,129
...you think that Metropolis' most
worshipped meathead was murdered?

117
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,132
Hey, now, that's my childhood hero
you're talking smack about.

118
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,834
And the one baseball card
I still can't manage to snag.

119
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,488
Still?

120
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,004
Yeah, it's an investment.

121
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,632
So why the homicide hunch on this guy?

122
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:22,344
The obit writer left me
Dawson's file to scan his photo.

123
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,914
Preliminary investigation's
calling it suicide but...

124
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,117
...how's a guy who's larger than life
drown in two feet of water?

125
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,353
Well, his career was over...

126
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,956
...and Lake was right,
the coroner's report says...

127
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,058
...Dawson was juiced up
on muscle mixers.

128
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,194
Chloe, come on. You're gonna tell me
that someone on roid rage...

129
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:44,458
...is gonna lie down in a
koi pond and call it a day?

130
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,506
You said you'd
have it ready by today.

131
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,343
<i>Well, that was before
you added the Zen waterfall.</i>

132
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,078
<i>I have to get approval.</i>

133
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,115
Approval? Oh, please. This pulp rag
lives or dies by my column.

134
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,917
Now, you get it
done by today...

135
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,921
...or you're gonna be decorating
bathrooms in strip malls.

136
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,109
Get out!

137
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,464
Mr. Luthor...

138
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,905
...now, there's only one reason
a celebrity pays me a house call.

139
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,818
Right to the point.

140
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,876
Since you have a
unique way of exhuming...

141
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,045
...even the most
carefully buried secrets...

142
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,414
...I have a little freelance
assignment for you.

143
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,250
I quit doing freelance
when I quit fetching lattes...

144
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,186
...for pudgy-fingered newsroom vultures.

145
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,024
Well, I'll let you decide
what it's worth to you.

146
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,059
Fill in whatever
number you want.

147
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:49,583
Just get me anything you can
on Clark Kent and Lana Lang.

148
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,042
Okay, how long do I
have to do this for?

149
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,182
What was it you said?

150
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,746
"Yoga's glorified
stretching with chants."

151
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,682
A different perspective
from down here.

152
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:12,906
Yeah, well, this is a good way
to strengthen your core, trust me.

153
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,460
I didn't realize that
my core was in question.

154
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,324
You really wanna keep talking?

155
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,093
No.

156
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,517
Oh, it's a scratch.
Don't worry about it.

157
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,512
A scratch?

158
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,657
How did that happen?

159
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,760
It was a fencing accident.
- With a real blade?

160
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,831
You know, the tip
snapped off and caught me.

161
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,934
Trust me, it looks
worse than it feels, okay?

162
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,963
I promise.

163
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,808
Thank you for all of the chakra
reorganizing, but I have to go.

164
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,496
Well...

165
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,509
Goodbye.

166
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,817
Smallville. Sorry
about the article.

167
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,919
It's bad enough to have
a broken heart...

168
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,421
...but to have it splashed
all over the newspapers.

169
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,624
I guess that's what
reporters do, don't they?

170
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:01,496
Okay, I think that little zinger just
ricocheted off Linda Lake and hit me.

171
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,651
Look, I'm sorry.

172
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,268
It's just people
keep secrets for a reason.

173
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,729
I don't know.

174
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,239
If you ask me, I think a secret is
just a big loophole...

175
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,376
...in the whole "Thou
shall not lie" clause.

176
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,578
There's just no gray area
with you, is there?

177
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,281
Not when someone I thought I knew
better than anyone...

178
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,217
...has been keeping
the biggest secret of all.

179
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,652
What are you talking about?

180
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,889
What would you do if one day you
realized someone close to you...

181
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,113
...had a serious hero complex?

182
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,907
Hero complex?

183
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:38,733
Hiding his true identity from everyone
he supposedly cares about.

184
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:43,939
You can't tell me you wouldn't find
something wrong with that.

185
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,007
Who exactly are
we talking about?

186
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,470
Green Arrow, a.k.a. Oliver Queen.

187
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,268
Oliver.

188
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,450
Jimmy snapped
photos of Green Arrow...

189
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,554
...getting slashed in the arm
exactly where OIlie's arm is cut.

190
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,857
Plus, the time
printed on the photos...

191
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:08,261
...is exactly the same time OIlie
disappeared on me that same night.

192
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,361
When are you planning to unload
this theory on Oliver?

193
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,020
I need proof first. Definitive proof.

194
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,917
That's where I thought
you might come in handy.

195
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,362
I swear I'm losing my
scare reflex because of you.

196
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,664
Lois asked me...
- Oh, please, Clark.

197
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,534
Are you gonna tell me why you're
digging in Lois' purse, Snoop Dogg?

198
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:51,406
Wait, let me guess. You're covering for
the new pledge of your hero fraternity.

199
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,743
Last time Lois said she had a lead
on Green Arrow, she was bluffing.

200
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,945
She says Jimmy has shots
that'd help ID him.

201
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,272
Jimmy?
He's moonlighting for Lois?

202
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,886
I guess we all
have secrets to keep.

203
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:09,603
You should know that better
than anyone right now.

204
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,063
You knew that Lana
was pregnant, didn't you?

205
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,751
Clark.

206
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,800
Before you unload
your anger on me...

207
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,603
...can I just say that I think
it is incredibly unfair...

208
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,139
...that everyone trusts me
to keep their secrets...

209
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,775
...then they turn around
and they throw me attitude...

210
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,677
...for keeping
someone else's secret.

211
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,113
Look, I'm sorry that I had to take
a two-second breather...

212
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,350
...from hiding the fact that
you're an alien from another planet...

213
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,353
...to protect
someone else for a change.

214
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,314
God.

215
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,102
You had that coming, you know.

216
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,111
For the record...

217
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:19,338
...I prefer "intergalactic traveler"
over "alien from another planet."

218
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,839
Hey.

219
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,709
Hey.

220
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,507
Thanks for finally returning
one of my phone calls.

221
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,130
How much does Lana Lang's
personal life...

222
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,474
...boost newspaper sales these days?

223
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,324
Okay. I was expecting that.

224
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,740
But to be honest, I was kind of hoping
you'd give me the benefit of the doubt.

225
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,176
I guess there's a shortage
of those today.

226
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,780
That article recites
our conversation verbatim.

227
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,249
Do you honestly think
I'd betray you like that?

228
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,351
What other explanation is there?

229
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,386
I'm not sure, but
the Lana Lang I know...

230
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,990
...would at least give
me a chance to find one.

231
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,395
After Clark, I
guess I'm so jaded...

232
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,767
...I don't even know what to expect
from my friends anymore.

233
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,103
So I take it the conversation
didn't go so well.

234
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,928
Conversation?

235
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,076
Clark left the Talon to go talk to you.
- About what?

236
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,798
Well...

237
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,937
I don't...

238
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,616
I should just put a
bag over my head that says:

239
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,720
"If you wanna keep a
secret, don't tell me."

240
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,867
What did he wanna say?

241
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,325
You two need to O.K.
Corral it on your own.

242
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:02,864
I've been blamed for putting words
in people's mouths enough for one day.

243
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,708
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

244
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,904
I don't understand how every
intimate detail of my life...

245
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,475
...is being leaked
into Linda Lake's column.

246
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,177
From what I found out,
her reconnaissance techniques...

247
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:20,381
...aren't exactly from the
Journalist Code of Ethics.

248
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:26,765
I think it's time we turn the tables
on our little resident voyeur.

249
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,227
Hey, I got your
call. What's the 911?

250
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,595
I've been thinking.

251
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,930
Maybe your Oliver theory
isn't so far out there.

252
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,700
If he is the Green Arrow,
you deserve to know the truth.

253
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:43,238
Really? Because I've been doing
some thinking of my own...

254
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,140
...and maybe I
don't wanna know.

255
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,709
I went through the articles
on Green Arrow's crimes.

256
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,777
What if we just got off
on the wrong foot?

257
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,280
The rob-from-the-rich-
to-give-to-the-poor thing...

258
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,983
...that wins him some points.
- Are you feeling okay?

259
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,220
No, I'm not all right, Clark.
I think I'm in love with Oliver.

260
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:02,624
I don't know how you ever
let Lana go if you felt this way...

261
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,261
...because I swear the guy could tell me
he was from Mars right now...

262
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:11,166
...and I would find a way to
dismiss it as an endearing quirk.

263
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,334
Lois, you're like a
pit bull on a pant leg.

264
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,505
You're never gonna let this go
until you know for sure.

265
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,929
I hate that you
know me like that.

266
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:27,033
But I can't just pull a Lois
and ambush him. What if I'm wrong?

267
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:31,159
What if you never
need to confront him?

268
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,163
Isn't this exciting?
Our first group movie night?

269
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:46,027
I mean, don't you
just love spontaneity?

270
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:51,291
Let me get it.
Clark. Come on in.

271
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,743
Let me get your jacket.

272
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,353
Thanks for having me over.

273
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,381
Lois, looks like
you went all out.

274
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,984
Well, it's not
a party until...

275
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,920
Oh, no. I can't
believe I did that.

276
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,890
You can't have
cocktails without ice.

277
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,825
Don't worry, yours will be virgin.

278
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,094
You know what, I'll
run to the corner, I can...

279
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,678
No. No, I got it.
My party, my bad.

280
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,173
You think she
suspects anything?

281
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,949
She's a little preoccupied.
- Then it's showtime.

282
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,409
Oliver...

283
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,091
...they're chasing me.

284
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,793
I don't know how
many there are, 10 maybe.

285
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,337
I shouldn't have
cut down the alley.

286
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,290
Oh, my God, Oliver. Help me.

287
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,999
Good one, Lois.

288
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,403
Need some help?

289
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,490
You didn't tell me
there was gonna be real thugs.

290
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,514
They kind of made
an impromptu appearance.

291
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,594
Let her go.

292
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,335
Let's go! Come on, come on!

293
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,200
Your secret's
safe with me, Oliver.

294
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,486
You're...
- A hell of a thank you.

295
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,069
Did you just call him Oliver?

296
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,253
It was just a hunch.

297
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,849
All right, Lana,
you ready for your close-up?

298
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,118
I can't believe
this is so easy.

299
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,821
Okay. How are my pearly
megapixels looking?

300
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,324
Crystal clear. Since
we're eavesdropping...

301
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,127
...can you find out what
else she has on Lex and me?

302
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,811
Yeah, sure. Do a little
recon while we're at it.

303
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,578
Chloe, what is it?

304
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,097
Clark...

305
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,950
Like tomorrow's headline?

306
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,612
And here I thought your hatred
was just professional jealousy.

307
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,616
Who knew you were covering
such a scandalous secret?

308
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,452
You're actually gonna
stake your reputation...

309
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,922
<i>...on this tabloid garbage
that's not even fit for the Inquisitor?</i>

310
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,757
Nobody's gonna believe you.

311
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:34,095
Oh, of course they will.
I have a very trustworthy source.

312
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,248
You.

313
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,267
And, no doubt, if anyone
goes looking for proof...

314
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,603
<i>... well, I think
theyre gonna find it.</i>

315
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,341
<i>But I must say, I am impressed.
Here you were, sitting on a story...</i>

316
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,211
...that could have earned you
a major headline.

317
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,280
You chose to protect
your friend instead.

318
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,583
Not a hard decisión to make
when you actually care about someone.

319
00:26:55,747 --> 00:27:01,385
<i>Its values like that that keep
your career in the basement.</i>

320
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:04,566
Don't you just
love the Internet?

321
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:10,460
Did you know, with just
one touch of a button...

322
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,202
...I can be on
every major talk show?

323
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,472
<i>And everyone at You Tube
will know that your farm-boy friend...</i>

324
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,968
...is really an...

325
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,136
alien.

326
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,182
Your credibility
might be at stake...

327
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,485
...when you're locked up
for Dawson's murder.

328
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,553
Mike Dawson drowned.
Do your homework.

329
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,322
It's in every
police report.

330
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,125
Most police aren't from Smallville.
You remember Smallville, don't you?

331
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,795
You were a rookie
reporter for KSCW...

332
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,130
...who went for the second
meteor shower.

333
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,899
Moth got too close to the flame...

334
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,568
...and your news van took
a nosedive into Crater Lake.

335
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:51,172
My guess is you walked out
with some sort of special ability.

336
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,976
From what I found out, Mike Dawson
wasn't your first victim, was he?

337
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,700
Nobody likes an overachiever.

338
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,584
Hey, Sullivan.

339
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:10,389
You wanna rise above sea level,
you better sharpen those teeth.

340
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:23,475
Oh, my God, she came out of nowhere.
- It's okay. She's gone now.

341
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,350
Yes.

342
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,829
Hey, how are the secret
adventures of Lois and Jimmy?

343
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,790
Busted.

344
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,034
Oh, my God, what happened
to your face?

345
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,958
You should see
the other guy.

346
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,108
Who did that to you?

347
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,544
You can put your dueling pistol away.
It was just a workplace scuffle.

348
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,088
You were right about Lake.

349
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,818
Looks like we're
two-for-two tonight.

350
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,589
I wanted you to be the first one
to take a look at this.

351
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,220
Check it out.

352
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,193
Green Arrow. I got
real pictures of him.

353
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,121
Face and all.

354
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,788
And this one's
not yet rated.

355
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,162
I feel dirty.

356
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,906
Think about how Oliver feels.

357
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,042
Lois and Clark put this
scheme together...

358
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,344
...because they
thought Oliver was Green Arrow.

359
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,279
Poor sucker comes
around the corner...

360
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:49,623
...catches her sucking lip
with leather daddy.

361
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,820
This, this is
the real money shot.

362
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,124
Get ready to meet the Green Arrow.

363
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,717
No. No, no, this
is not happening.

364
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,832
I had his face in the crosshairs.
How could he be there...

365
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,306
...and then just
gone like the '90s?

366
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:13,607
Gone as in "faster than a thousandth
of a second" shutter speed?

367
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,171
Yeah. Weird.

368
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:23,054
I always thought he was super-cool.
I didn't realize he was superhuman.

369
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,081
Clark.
- What's going on?

370
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,928
Lois was just telling me
about her exciting night last night.

371
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,298
Yeah, I don't know where you
disappeared to last night, Smallville.

372
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,133
Turns out I was
wrong about Oliver.

373
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,702
He's not the Green Arrow,
can you believe that?

374
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,306
And luckily Oliver showed up
when our hero was still around...

375
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,708
...but looks like you were
way off base about him.

376
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:52,780
And the craziest part is he chucked
a guy across an alley, right?

377
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,083
Oh, yeah.
- And then super-sped away.

378
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,442
I mean, who does that?

379
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,196
It's good Oliver showed up
when he did, then you knew for sure.

380
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,565
Oh, she knew before he showed up.

381
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,718
You did?

382
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,732
Ask her how.

383
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,891
How?

384
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,289
I kissed him.

385
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,186
Isn't that romantic?

386
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,651
Oh, I'm sorry,
Lois. Finish the story.

387
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,343
This is the best part.

388
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,325
Well, he was holding me in his arms...

389
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:43,029
...and OIlie's a good kisser,
don't get me wrong.

390
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,599
But that Green Arrow...

391
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,443
...he could teach
OIlie a thing or two.

392
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,875
Hey.

393
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,980
You took off early
last night. You okay?

394
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,079
I just keep running what
happened through my head.

395
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,138
Lana, you can't blame yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

396
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,142
That part I'm
pretty clear on.

397
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,212
Look, nobody wanted to see her die...

398
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,647
...but if you hadn't come
when you did...

399
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:37,151
...it would've been my obit
on the front page.

400
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,612
Maybe.

401
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,751
Of section D.

402
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,882
Anyway, thank you. Again.

403
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,994
How do you do that?

404
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,259
Just brush it under the rug
as if nothing happened?

405
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:05,546
Lana, Linda wasn't the first
freak of nature who went psycho.

406
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,075
No.

407
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:13,339
I mean, whatever it is
you're protecting about Clark.

408
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,458
I don't know what
you're talking about.

409
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,522
Yes, you do.

410
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,592
Some secret about a farm boy?

411
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:29,837
Made you take a hammer to her
computer before I could hear the rest.

412
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,221
Come on, Chloe,
I'm not that naive.

413
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:35,242
Whatever it is you two
have been hiding...

414
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:40,706
...do you really expect me
to keep looking the other way?

415
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,152
Linda was grasping at straws.

416
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,321
She's always desperate
for her next story...

417
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,805
...you know that
better than anyone.

418
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,048
Lana.

419
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,432
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

420
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,405
That's what Clark always says.

421
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:42,716
I'm sorry that you
had to find out like this.

422
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,012
It's okay.

423
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,670
You don't have to tell me every
little detail of your life anymore.

424
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:05,165
Clark, we both know that a proposal
is more than a little...

425
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,694
...detail.

426
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,473
And as messed
up as it is...

427
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:17,063
...you were the first person
that I wanted to tell.

428
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,015
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

429
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,852
Clark, you said that
you didn't love me anymore.

430
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:30,756
And I tried to cut everything off,
but I'm not made that way.

431
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,627
Even if we're
not talking...

432
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,151
...you are still
a part of my life.

433
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,367
And I'm not trying
to deny it anymore.

434
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,211
I am trying to put
it into perspective.

435
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,824
I guess we both
need to do that.

436
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,519
Chloe said that you
came by to talk to me.

437
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,515
What was it about?

438
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,906
Whatever secret Chloe is
helping you to protect, Clark...

439
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,726
...please...

440
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,798
...just once...

441
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,976
Just trust me.

442
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,618
Doesn't matter now.

443
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,278
Clark, don't do that.

444
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,457
I know about the baby.

445
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,265
Lex told me.

446
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,695
Everything's changed.

447
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,014
Even the fact
that you told me...

448
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:06,053
...that you look back at the past
and regret it every day?

449
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,276
Has that changed too?

450
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,079
I guess that I can't ask you
to see me the same way.

451
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,262
Lana.

452
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,757
I hope Lex makes you very happy.

453
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,666
A million dollars
for your thoughts.

454
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,740
Sorry.

455
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:18,738
My comic timing is the
first to go after my nerves.

456
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,944
You know, in all my life...

457
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:28,954
...I've never made an offer
when I was afraid of the answer...

458
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,100
...till now.

459
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,871
You have been so patient.

460
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,136
Doesn't feel like it.

461
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,220
I went to see Clark.

462
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,514
And?

463
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,029
And I love him.

464
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:10,301
I love both of you
and maybe I always will.

465
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:21,505
Lex, I couldn't say yes to you, knowing
that I might look back with regrets.

466
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,174
You deserve better than that.

467
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,580
Lana, with the
life I've led...

468
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:37,471
...I go to bed praying every night
that I don't get what I deserve.

469
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,500
You get bitter...

470
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,402
...and vengeful.

471
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,083
And then you meet someone...

472
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,578
...who's so good...

473
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:59,931
...that she might be the one person
who could learn to love you.

474
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,484
I would wait forever for that.

475
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,644
You don't have to.

476
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,701
I'm done looking back.

477
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,010
I have someone
right in front of me...

478
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,735
...who I know trusts me...

479
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:27,887
...and who lets me see
sides of him no one else does.

480
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,148
So just for clarification...

481
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,090
Yes, Lex Luthor.

482
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,865
I will marry you.
