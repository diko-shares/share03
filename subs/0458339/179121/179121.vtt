ARKANGEL CHEMICAL WEAPONS
FACILITY - USSR

2
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,175
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

3
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,405
Ni odnoho vyzdoha. Gdye vashy?

4
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,516
I'm alone.

5
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,263
Aren't we all?

6
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,730
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

7
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,599
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.

8
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:01,613
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.

9
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:47,361
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.

10
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,233
And the other half?

11
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,663
Fate.

12
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:57,213
- Set timers: six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

13
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,252
Fire.

14
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:30,637
- Closing time, James. Last call.
- Buy me a pint.

15
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,300
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Come out with your hands up.

16
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,976
How original.

17
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,477
Shut the door, Alec. There's a draught.

18
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,104
Alec?

19
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:18,858
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

20
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:22,608
- Finish the job, James. Blow them to hell.
- You have ten seconds.

21
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,277
Ten,

22
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,428
nine, eight,

23
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:32,419
seven, six,

24
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:36,009
five, four,

25
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:38,362
- three, two...
- For England, James.

26
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:44,305
Hold your fire. You'll blow the gas tanks.

27
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,131
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands...

28
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,752
Wait.

29
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,353
You can't win.

30
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,851
Get out there. Move. Move it.

31
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,287
Hold your fire.

32
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,167
Wait.

33
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:25,523
# See reflections on the water

34
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,949
# More than darkness in the depths

35
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:34,416
# See him surface in every shadow

36
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,082
# On the wind, I feel his breath

37
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,189
# GoldenEye, I've found his weakness

38
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,935
# GoldenEye, he'll do what I please

39
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:52,003
# GoldenEye, no time for sweetness

40
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:57,068
# But a bitter kiss
will bring him to his knees

41
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:06,080
# See him move
through smoke and mirrors

42
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,268
# Feel his presence in the crowd

43
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:15,332
# Other girls, they gather around him

44
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:19,081
# lfl had him, I wouldn't let him out

45
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,548
# GoldenEye, not lace or leather

46
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:28,134
# Golden chain, take him to the spot

47
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:32,800
# GoldenEye, I'll show him forever

48
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:36,987
# It'll take forever to see what I've got

49
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,374
# You'll never know

50
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:46,758
# How I watched you
from the shadows as a child

51
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:50,387
# You'll never know

52
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:55,850
# How it feels
to get so close and be denied

53
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:59,878
# It's a golden honey trap

54
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:04,065
# I've got for you tonight

55
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,578
# Revenge, it's a kiss

56
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,731
# This time I won't miss

57
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,750
# Now I've got you in my sight

58
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:20,655
# With a GoldenEye

59
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:25,401
# Golden, GoldenEye

60
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:29,269
# With a GoldenEye

61
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:34,294
# GoldenEye

62
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,409
NINE YEARS LATER

63
00:12:56,746 --> 00:13:01,612
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.

64
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:14,892
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

65
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,352
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

66
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,080
James, stop this. Stop it.

67
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,270
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?

68
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,461
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

69
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,614
- Engine?
- Ego.

70
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:37,323
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

71
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:41,590
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?

72
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,439
Ladies first.

73
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:34,670
James, I want you to stop this car.

74
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,182
- Really?
- Stop this car at once.

75
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,149
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

76
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,042
James, you're incorrigible.

77
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,515
What am I going to do with you?

78
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:03,224
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

79
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,279
A very thorough evaluation.

80
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,124
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Très heureux de vous revoir.

81
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:40,312
- Bonsoir, Pierre. Ça va bien?
- Très bien. Et vous?

82
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,126
Sept à la banque.

83
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,117
Madame wins.

84
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,289
Bet, mademoiselle? Non?

85
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,802
Monsieur.

86
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,875
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

87
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,345
- No players?
- Banco.

88
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:38,616
It appears we share the same passions.

89
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,490
Three, anyway.

90
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:46,239
I count two - motoring and baccarat.

91
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,266
Huit, pour la banque.

92
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,732
Seven. Madame wins.

93
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:58,480
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

94
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,351
One rises to meet a challenge.

95
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,896
Double.

96
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,129
Suivez.

97
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,884
Carte.

98
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:38,989
Madame stands with five.

99
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,488
- Six. Madame loses.
- Buliatch.

100
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,588
- Enjoy it while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

101
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,841
And what words do you live by?

102
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:04,785
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

103
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,018
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

104
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,726
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

105
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,800
And for you?

106
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,953
The same.

107
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,026
How do you take it?

108
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,176
Straight up, with a twist.

109
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,601
Thank you, Mr...

110
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,632
The name's Bond. James Bond.

111
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,984
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

112
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,051
- Onatopp?
- Onatopp.

113
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:38,955
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Very good, Mr Bond.

114
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,347
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

115
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:44,976
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

116
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:48,843
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

117
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,432
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

118
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,541
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

119
00:19:55,701 --> 00:20:01,323
A tip for your friend: the French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

120
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,914
Even the counterfeit ones.

121
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:11,011
And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?

122
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,487
Commander.

123
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,560
Shall we go?

124
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,750
This one is an admiral.

125
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:20,022
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

126
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,571
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

127
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,561
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

128
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:52,204
Transmission begins from Moneypenny.

129
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:56,909
Identification confirmed.
Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.

130
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:00,697
Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St Petersburg.

131
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:04,325
Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.

132
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:06,718
M authorises you
to observe Miss Onatopp,

133
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:11,103
but stipulates no contact
without prior approval.

134
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,336
End oftransmission. Moneypenny.

135
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,602
Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay "onatopp" ofthings.

136
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:34,308
Lyubeemyets.

137
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:01,381
Xenia, I can't breathe.

138
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,226
Yes! Yes!

139
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,325
Merci, mon amiral.

140
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:18,571
My respects, Admiral.

141
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,994
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

142
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,539
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:32,646
please take your seats
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

144
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:09,168
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battlefield:

145
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:12,716
the first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

146
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:16,385
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

147
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,491
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

148
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,083
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

149
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:35,842
I have a small surprise from
your friends at the barracks.

150
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,875
I think I've gone to heaven.

151
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,590
Not yet.

152
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:50,235
Please welcome the pilots.

153
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:56,973
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

154
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:45,656
Space Weapons Control Centre
Severnaya, Russia

155
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,598
Select Mir.

156
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:06,309
Orthographic projection.

157
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:12,011
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage geo-sat two.

158
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:22,559
Anna.

159
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:28,856
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

160
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:33,679
Boris.

161
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,346
What?

162
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:41,172
I thought I'd post it
on the lnternet, no?

163
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:44,481
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

164
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,829
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

165
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:52,173
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

166
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:57,554
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

167
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,102
You're such a geek.

168
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,410
Yes. I'm in.

169
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:13,258
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

170
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:15,291
What if they trace it here?

171
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,078
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

172
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:22,545
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

173
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:25,495
I think not.

174
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:29,480
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

175
00:28:30,517 --> 00:28:33,307
You were saying, slug-head?

176
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,137
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

177
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,079
- Spiked them.
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.

178
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,869
No way. I spiked them.

179
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:50,366
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.

180
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:53,196
OK. Let me guess.

181
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,747
It's not in front of me?

182
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:59,095
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

183
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:07,146
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

184
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:10,415
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

185
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:14,241
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

186
00:29:17,948 --> 00:29:20,499
"Better luck next time,

187
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:22,292
slug-heads."

188
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,557
Bang. Gone. I am invincible.

189
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:34,210
Was it good for you, too?

190
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:36,761
I'm getting some coffee.

191
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,834
I'm going for a cigarette.

192
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:44,639
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

193
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,749
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

194
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:02,815
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

195
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:06,083
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.

196
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:11,663
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.

197
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:13,257
Good.

198
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,330
Here is the authorisation code.

199
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:20,233
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

200
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,385
I am timing you.

201
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,550
Good. Thank you, Major.

202
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,216
On my count.

203
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:35,365
Three, two, one...

204
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,728
Set target. Severnaya.

205
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:58,722
Arm the weapon.

206
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,231
Check it.

207
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:38,421
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

208
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:14,692
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

209
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:52,716
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

210
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:55,865
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

211
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:59,133
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

212
00:34:59,293 --> 00:35:02,880
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

213
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,431
I know you'll find this crushing, 007,

214
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:09,098
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

215
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,366
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

216
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:15,953
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.

217
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:18,345
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

218
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:20,816
What would I ever do without you?

219
00:35:20,976 --> 00:35:24,882
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

220
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,983
Hope springs eternal.

221
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:33,611
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

222
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,999
Really? What's the penalty for that?

223
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:40,068
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.

224
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:48,238
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

225
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,812
- Good evening, 007.
- Tanner. What's up?

226
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:58,562
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

227
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:02,468
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

228
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:11,675
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?

229
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:15,900
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

230
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:23,752
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...

231
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:28,774
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

232
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:31,405
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

233
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,673
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

234
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:37,663
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

235
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:39,815
Thank you.

236
00:36:39,974 --> 00:36:43,522
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

237
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,112
and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.

238
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,823
What do you think the base is used for?

239
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:51,613
We suspected it might be
the ground station

240
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:55,240
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

241
00:36:55,399 --> 00:37:00,063
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

242
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,933
Numbers were never my strong suit.

243
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,483
Are these pictures live?

244
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:11,860
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

245
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,799
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

246
00:38:37,593 --> 00:38:39,704
What the bloody hell was that?

247
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:03,963
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

248
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:21,409
Boris. Boris.

249
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,158
Thanks.

250
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:28,460
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

251
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:33,839
We have another, coming into range now.

252
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,297
Good God.

253
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,723
Two of the MiGs are down.

254
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:45,073
It looks like the third went into the dish.

255
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:47,105
What do you think?

256
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,806
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

257
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,949
- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.

258
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,578
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

259
00:41:58,738 --> 00:42:03,518
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

260
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:05,590
I've read the brief.

261
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:10,132
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

262
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:15,151
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

263
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:20,131
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

264
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,597
So, GoldenEye exists.

265
00:42:24,752 --> 00:42:26,266
Yes.

266
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:29,613
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.

267
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:32,999
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

268
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:36,505
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

269
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:40,767
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

270
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,676
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

271
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:48,735
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

272
00:42:55,388 --> 00:42:57,699
There had to be an insider.

273
00:43:05,268 --> 00:43:07,659
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

274
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:31,880
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

275
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:38,215
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

276
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:41,322
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

277
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,314
What else do we know about Janus?

278
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:46,661
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

279
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,569
Restocked the lraqis during the Gulf War.

280
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,875
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

281
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:58,134
The woman, Onatopp,
is our only confirmed contact.

282
00:43:58,254 --> 00:44:01,680
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

283
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,225
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

284
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:08,213
- Ice?
- Yes.

285
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:20,404
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

286
00:44:20,563 --> 00:44:24,348
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

287
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:30,403
Ourumov. They made him a general.

288
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:33,351
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

289
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:37,216
Our political analysts say
he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.

290
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,120
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

291
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:45,980
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

292
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:50,084
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

293
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:54,864
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

294
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,215
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

295
00:44:57,374 --> 00:45:00,442
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

296
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:04,266
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

297
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:07,891
obviously appealed to that young woman
I sent out to evaluate you.

298
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:10,959
- Point taken.
- Not quite, 007.

299
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:14,704
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

300
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:17,094
your instincts are dead wrong.

301
00:45:17,253 --> 00:45:20,002
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

302
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:25,580
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

303
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,882
I want you to find GoldenEye.

304
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:33,189
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

305
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:35,699
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

306
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:40,798
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

307
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:45,379
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

308
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,089
Never.

309
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:53,467
Bond...

310
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:57,849
Come back alive.

311
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:05,418
St Petersburg, Russia

312
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:38,723
Good morning, General Ourumov.

313
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:43,066
Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

314
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:45,775
Please, deliver your report.

315
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:53,464
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -

316
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:55,535
was detonated over Severnaya.

317
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:59,997
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

318
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:04,459
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

319
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:07,049
seeking to create political unrest.

320
00:47:10,092 --> 00:47:14,273
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

321
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,180
have been set back by several years.

322
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:19,251
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

323
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:25,741
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

324
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,967
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

325
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,715
I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.

326
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:35,099
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

327
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:41,112
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

328
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:44,178
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

329
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,324
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

330
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:49,873
I will investigate immediately.

331
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:55,169
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

332
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:59,509
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

333
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,452
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.

334
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,075
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

335
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,380
That will be all.

336
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,826
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

337
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:31,605
Hunting.

338
00:48:31,764 --> 00:48:34,074
Right. Now pay attention, 007.

339
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:36,144
First, your new car.

340
00:48:36,303 --> 00:48:40,286
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

341
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:46,060
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

342
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:49,604
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

343
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,471
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

344
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,935
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

345
00:48:56,094 --> 00:49:02,665
Need I remind you, 007, that you have
a licence to kill, not break the traffic laws.

346
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,412
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

347
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:08,478
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

348
00:49:08,638 --> 00:49:14,053
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

349
00:49:16,682 --> 00:49:18,434
Have you finished?

350
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:19,907
- Yes.
- Good.

351
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:22,814
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

352
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:27,154
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

353
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:30,181
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

354
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,003
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

355
00:49:34,163 --> 00:49:37,309
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

356
00:49:37,468 --> 00:49:39,618
It's tested for one, 007.

357
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:47,343
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

358
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:51,644
X-ray document scanner.

359
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:54,830
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

360
00:49:54,989 --> 00:49:58,294
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

361
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,201
Another three disarms it.

362
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,338
How long did you say the fuse was?

363
00:50:06,776 --> 00:50:08,369
Grow up, 007.

364
00:50:08,528 --> 00:50:12,868
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

365
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:16,850
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

366
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,151
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

367
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,071
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?

368
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:33,137
Along with the rest of him.

369
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:36,562
Now, 007, do please try and return...

370
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:43,172
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

371
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,397
Don't touch that. That's my lunch.

372
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:12,997
In London, April's a spring month.

373
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,785
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

374
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:18,851
For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

375
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,200
with your secret codes and passwords.

376
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,386
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

377
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:27,014
Come on. My car's over there.

378
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,500
- After you.
- Thank you.

379
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:47,880
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

380
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,982
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

381
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:54,809
- Close enough for government work?
- No.

382
00:51:55,884 --> 00:51:58,831
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

383
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,260
All right, all right, all right.

384
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:15,794
- "Muffy"?
- Third wife.

385
00:52:15,954 --> 00:52:19,458
- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.

386
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:21,528
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

387
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:25,471
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

388
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:28,178
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

389
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:38,412
St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.

390
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:46,217
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

391
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,319
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

392
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:53,863
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

393
00:52:54,022 --> 00:52:56,332
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

394
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:02,265
Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

395
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:06,287
That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

396
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:09,592
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

397
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:12,021
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

398
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,242
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

399
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,069
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

400
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:23,569
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

401
00:53:26,914 --> 00:53:30,219
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

402
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:32,847
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

403
00:53:33,006 --> 00:53:35,316
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

404
00:53:35,475 --> 00:53:38,223
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.

405
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,827
Yes?

406
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:07,969
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?

407
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:11,911
24 for the American school,
1 1 for the Swedish.

408
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:17,167
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

409
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:20,313
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.

410
00:54:20,472 --> 00:54:22,463
If madam requires a demonstration...

411
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:27,282
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

412
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:41,697
Natalya.

413
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:02,005
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.

414
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:15,624
Let me get this straight, Jimmy.

415
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:19,367
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

416
00:55:19,526 --> 00:55:22,393
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

417
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:25,858
- Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

418
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:28,924
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

419
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,353
OK. Showtime.

420
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,198
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

421
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:41,268
Are you sure you wanna do this?

422
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:46,525
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.

423
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:50,308
Make sure they send me home first class.

424
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:46,176
Natalya. It's me. It's Boris.
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

425
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,981
Another morning shot to hell.

426
00:56:55,534 --> 00:56:59,635
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

427
00:57:03,856 --> 00:57:07,042
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

428
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:12,099
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

429
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:15,882
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

430
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,386
# Ooh-ahh

431
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:21,935
# And if you love him

432
00:57:22,094 --> 00:57:23,129
# Love him

433
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:25,957
# Oh, be so proud of him

434
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:27,151
# Of him

435
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,859
# Cos after all

436
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:32,288
# He's just a man

437
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:37,266
# Stand by your man...

438
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,243
James Bond.

439
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:45,707
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

440
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:49,451
"Shaken, but not stirred."

441
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:54,229
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.

442
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,626
Or your need for an audience.

443
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:04,321
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?

444
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,509
# Stand by your man

445
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:12,836
That is lrina, my mistress.

446
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:16,656
Very talented girl.

447
00:58:16,815 --> 00:58:19,003
Irina. Take a hike.

448
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:28,394
So, Mr Bond, what is it that
brings you to my neighbourhood?

449
00:58:28,553 --> 00:58:33,925
Still working for Ml6, or
have you joined the 21st century?

450
00:58:34,084 --> 00:58:36,193
I hear the new M is a lady.

451
00:58:36,352 --> 00:58:39,177
I want you to do me a favour.

452
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:44,190
He wants me to do him a favour.

453
00:58:44,946 --> 00:58:50,955
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.

454
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:54,496
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

455
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,963
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

456
00:58:57,122 --> 00:58:58,634
Silence.

457
00:58:58,793 --> 00:59:02,016
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

458
00:59:02,175 --> 00:59:06,672
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to

459
00:59:06,831 --> 00:59:08,940
miss the rest of you.

460
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:14,431
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.

461
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:18,808
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

462
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:25,094
Kirov's funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.

463
00:59:25,254 --> 00:59:28,278
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

464
00:59:28,437 --> 00:59:31,660
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

465
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,246
their man drives the hearse out.

466
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,952
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

467
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:40,732
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

468
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,841
Your money.

469
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,586
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

470
00:59:45,825 --> 00:59:48,809
I want you to set me up with Janus.

471
00:59:49,525 --> 00:59:53,743
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

472
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:57,006
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

473
00:59:57,165 --> 01:00:00,905
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

474
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,839
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

475
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:08,545
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

476
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:13,200
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

477
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,224
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

478
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:18,930
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

479
01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:22,432
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

480
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:26,769
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

481
01:00:26,928 --> 01:00:30,071
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

482
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,140
who promptly had them all shot.

483
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,687
Women, children, families.

484
01:00:36,279 --> 01:00:39,024
Not exactly our finest hour.

485
01:00:39,183 --> 01:00:42,804
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

486
01:00:42,963 --> 01:00:46,783
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

487
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:51,001
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and

488
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,303
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

489
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:56,256
You don't need the gun, Commander.

490
01:01:56,415 --> 01:02:00,116
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

491
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:07,039
That's close enough.

492
01:02:07,198 --> 01:02:09,546
Not for what I have in mind.

493
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:34,892
You think you can hurt me?

494
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:55,424
You think you can break me?

495
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:05,849
Yes! Yes! Yes!

496
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:14,881
No, no, no.

497
01:03:15,398 --> 01:03:17,308
No more foreplay.

498
01:03:18,303 --> 01:03:20,133
Take me to Janus.

499
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:21,009
Buliatch.

500
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:23,197
Take me to Janus.

501
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:24,311
Buliatch.

502
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,148
- This is it?
- Yes.

503
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:45,718
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

504
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:49,498
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

505
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:53,756
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

506
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:58,212
Sweet dreams.

507
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:08,601
Hello, James.

508
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:33,430
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

509
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:37,806
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at Ml6.

510
01:05:37,966 --> 01:05:42,303
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

511
01:05:44,093 --> 01:05:46,003
Why?

512
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:50,022
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

513
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:56,508
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

514
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:59,890
only to come home - "Well done.
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

515
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:03,073
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

516
01:06:03,232 --> 01:06:06,694
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

517
01:06:06,853 --> 01:06:12,424
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,
defender of the so-called faith.

518
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:14,811
Please, James, put it away.

519
01:06:15,527 --> 01:06:19,546
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

520
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,610
Yes.

521
01:06:24,361 --> 01:06:29,891
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

522
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:34,626
How did the Ml6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

523
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:38,207
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

524
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,555
We're both orphans, James.

525
01:06:40,714 --> 01:06:44,693
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

526
01:06:44,852 --> 01:06:49,229
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

527
01:06:49,388 --> 01:06:54,482
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

528
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:57,187
Ml6 figured I was too young to remember.

529
01:06:57,864 --> 01:07:00,291
And in one of life's little ironies,

530
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,514
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

531
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:06,936
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

532
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:12,387
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

533
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:15,252
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

534
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:18,833
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

535
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:24,085
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

536
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:28,820
By the way,

537
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:33,834
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

538
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:37,614
007's loyalty was always to the mission,

539
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:39,584
never to his friend.

540
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:43,324
Closing time, James. Last call.

541
01:07:58,326 --> 01:07:59,758
For England, James.

542
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:02,663
Wake up. Mister.

543
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:07,517
Wake up, please. Wake up.

544
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:09,586
I'm here. I'm here.

545
01:08:09,746 --> 01:08:12,571
Hurry. Hurry up. Come on.

546
01:08:13,645 --> 01:08:16,351
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die.

547
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:22,439
- Do something. Get us out of here.
- I'm a little tied up.

548
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:23,911
Never mind.

549
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:42,300
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

550
01:09:43,891 --> 01:09:45,801
Here. Let me help you.

551
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,388
That's it. Mind your head.

552
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:57,739
Let me go.

553
01:10:39,559 --> 01:10:41,708
Who are you?

554
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:46,363
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

555
01:10:46,522 --> 01:10:48,432
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

556
01:10:48,592 --> 01:10:50,700
Look, they might be back any minute.

557
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,441
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

558
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,186
I've never been to Severnaya.

559
01:10:57,346 --> 01:11:00,449
Your watch has. Frozen
by the GoldenEye blast.

560
01:11:01,563 --> 01:11:06,299
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

561
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:09,044
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

562
01:11:09,203 --> 01:11:11,511
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

563
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:15,570
- But I don't know anything.
- Then start with what you do know.

564
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:27,348
My name is Natalya Simonova.

565
01:11:28,025 --> 01:11:31,526
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

566
01:11:31,685 --> 01:11:33,595
Go on.

567
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,932
- ..until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

568
01:11:38,092 --> 01:11:42,309
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

569
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:44,578
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

570
01:11:44,737 --> 01:11:48,398
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

571
01:11:48,557 --> 01:11:51,461
- There was no one else?
- No.

572
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:56,276
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

573
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:59,221
Trust me.

574
01:12:00,852 --> 01:12:03,996
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

575
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:08,611
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

576
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:18,161
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

577
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,543
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

578
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:23,613
What, no small talk?

579
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,722
No chitchat?

580
01:12:25,881 --> 01:12:30,218
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

581
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:34,038
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.

582
01:12:34,197 --> 01:12:36,585
- Where is the GoldenEye?
- I assumed you had it.

583
01:12:36,744 --> 01:12:40,126
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

584
01:12:40,285 --> 01:12:43,628
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?

585
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:47,249
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

586
01:12:47,408 --> 01:12:51,387
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you. Stop it.

587
01:12:51,546 --> 01:12:53,854
You're like boys with toys.

588
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:01,852
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

589
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,120
I saw him do it.

590
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:09,770
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

591
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:13,670
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

592
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:16,575
And why would he do that?

593
01:13:16,734 --> 01:13:19,121
There is another satellite.

594
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,214
Another GoldenEye.

595
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:27,835
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

596
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:31,218
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?

597
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:36,788
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

598
01:13:36,948 --> 01:13:39,892
- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech.

599
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:43,792
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

600
01:13:43,951 --> 01:13:46,139
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

601
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:50,317
- Put it down, General.
- Do you even know who the enemy is?

602
01:13:50,477 --> 01:13:51,989
- Do you?
- Guard.

603
01:13:58,037 --> 01:14:00,862
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

604
01:14:02,056 --> 01:14:05,756
murdered by British agent James Bond,

605
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:11,606
himself shot while trying to escape.

606
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:13,038
Guards.

607
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,572
Come on.

608
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:05,045
They're in the archive.

609
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,451
Down.

610
01:16:00,116 --> 01:16:02,901
Spread out. Cover the other side.

611
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,970
Trust me.

612
01:16:39,589 --> 01:16:41,857
Go now.

613
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:15,032
Faster.

614
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,217
Damn it.

615
01:17:42,259 --> 01:17:44,405
Down the alley.

616
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,153
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

617
01:18:55,395 --> 01:18:56,667
Nazad.

618
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,679
What was that?

619
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,565
Go left.

620
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,949
Get out.

621
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:28,960
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

622
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,782
Mishkin got to them before I could.

623
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:35,399
Bond is alive?

624
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:39,135
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

625
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:41,679
Bad for you.

626
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,051
Take a seat, my dear.

627
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:04,653
You know, James and I
shared everything.

628
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:08,787
Absolutely everything.

629
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,908
To the victor go the spoils.

630
01:23:24,328 --> 01:23:25,878
You'll like it where we're going.

631
01:23:32,318 --> 01:23:34,225
You may even learn to like me.

632
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:43,526
Svinya.

633
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,395
Stay with her.

634
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:53,980
Bond. Only Bond.

635
01:23:54,139 --> 01:23:56,683
He's going to derail us.

636
01:23:57,756 --> 01:23:59,783
- Full speed.
- Shto?

637
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:01,492
Full speed. Ram him.

638
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:04,235
Bye-bye.

639
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,679
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

640
01:25:06,838 --> 01:25:08,308
You first.

641
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:10,375
You second.

642
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:12,840
Up.

643
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:19,478
Situation analysis: hopeless.

644
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:23,492
You have no backup, no escape route.

645
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,354
And I have the only bargaining chip.

646
01:25:26,513 --> 01:25:30,726
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

647
01:25:32,356 --> 01:25:34,701
Ourumov, bring her in.

648
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,199
Lovely girl.

649
01:25:38,358 --> 01:25:41,736
Tastes like... Iike strawberries.

650
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:44,717
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

651
01:25:51,753 --> 01:25:54,654
So, back where we started, James.

652
01:25:54,813 --> 01:25:57,437
Your friend, or the mission?

653
01:25:57,914 --> 01:26:00,020
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

654
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:07,612
Ourumov, what has
this Cossack promised you?

655
01:26:08,964 --> 01:26:12,064
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

656
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:16,714
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you. Just like everyone else.

657
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:19,735
- Is this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours

658
01:26:19,894 --> 01:26:22,796
you and I will have more money than God,

659
01:26:22,955 --> 01:26:26,254
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service

660
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:31,659
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

661
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:34,720
So, what's the choice, James?

662
01:26:34,879 --> 01:26:38,377
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

663
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:40,960
The girl, or the mission?

664
01:26:41,477 --> 01:26:44,061
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

665
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,466
See you in hell, James.

666
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:03,895
- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!

667
01:27:08,426 --> 01:27:10,533
Boris. Yes.

668
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:14,190
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

669
01:27:14,349 --> 01:27:18,403
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

670
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:23,769
- Don't stand there. Get us out of here.
- Yes, sir.

671
01:27:45,205 --> 01:27:47,149
Good luck with the floor, James.

672
01:27:47,308 --> 01:27:50,799
I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.

673
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:54,132
It was the least I could do for a friend.

674
01:27:56,353 --> 01:27:59,368
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

675
01:28:31,385 --> 01:28:33,607
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?

676
01:28:33,765 --> 01:28:37,574
Boris' password. He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

677
01:28:37,733 --> 01:28:40,470
- Chair.
- Like I said...

678
01:28:44,676 --> 01:28:45,628
30 seconds.

679
01:28:45,786 --> 01:28:49,198
He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,...

680
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:52,253
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

681
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:54,197
- San Francisco,...
- 20 seconds.

682
01:28:54,356 --> 01:28:56,498
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

683
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:05,742
- Come on.
- Wait. He's in Cuba. Havana - no.

684
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:08,678
Now.

685
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:30,062
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

686
01:29:30,221 --> 01:29:32,760
Standard operating procedure.

687
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:35,894
Boys with toys.

688
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:43,392
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

689
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:44,900
Our trip?

690
01:29:45,059 --> 01:29:47,955
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

691
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:54,263
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

692
01:29:55,294 --> 01:30:01,245
So, tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

693
01:30:01,404 --> 01:30:04,657
I should be aware of, Commander?

694
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:10,648
Thousands.

695
01:30:10,807 --> 01:30:13,147
But I only pay them

696
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,647
Iip service.

697
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:40,919
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

698
01:30:41,078 --> 01:30:43,141
It's so beautiful.

699
01:30:43,299 --> 01:30:45,362
Not another human being in sight.

700
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:00,438
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

701
01:31:24,044 --> 01:31:28,924
Yo, Jimbo. Brought a little gift
from old whatshisname? T? Z?

702
01:31:29,082 --> 01:31:30,630
- Q.
- Yeah.

703
01:31:30,788 --> 01:31:34,200
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

704
01:31:34,637 --> 01:31:37,573
I am not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

705
01:31:37,731 --> 01:31:41,699
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

706
01:31:41,857 --> 01:31:43,008
Yes, I do.

707
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:45,507
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

708
01:31:45,825 --> 01:31:48,007
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

709
01:31:48,165 --> 01:31:50,704
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

710
01:31:50,823 --> 01:31:53,045
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

711
01:31:53,204 --> 01:31:56,735
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

712
01:31:56,894 --> 01:31:59,274
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.

713
01:31:59,433 --> 01:32:02,289
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

714
01:32:05,423 --> 01:32:07,605
Did you check her out?

715
01:32:07,764 --> 01:32:11,454
- Head to toe.
- Right...

716
01:32:12,168 --> 01:32:16,056
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football field, huh? Doesn't exist.

717
01:32:16,215 --> 01:32:19,547
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

718
01:32:19,706 --> 01:32:24,308
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

719
01:32:24,467 --> 01:32:27,085
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

720
01:32:27,244 --> 01:32:31,727
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

721
01:32:32,282 --> 01:32:34,544
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

722
01:32:34,702 --> 01:32:38,392
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade.

723
01:32:41,248 --> 01:32:44,383
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

724
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:47,755
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

725
01:32:48,469 --> 01:32:51,048
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

726
01:32:51,207 --> 01:32:53,746
He knows you're comin'.

727
01:33:53,851 --> 01:33:56,231
He was your friend - Trevelyan.

728
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:01,032
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

729
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:05,832
It is that simple?

730
01:34:05,991 --> 01:34:08,689
In a word, yes.

731
01:34:09,006 --> 01:34:11,188
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

732
01:34:11,347 --> 01:34:16,227
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

733
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:18,687
So you can be a hero?

734
01:34:19,837 --> 01:34:22,059
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

735
01:34:22,217 --> 01:34:25,153
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

736
01:34:27,256 --> 01:34:29,795
It's what keeps me alive.

737
01:34:30,827 --> 01:34:33,762
No. It's what keeps you alone.

738
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:13,277
James...

739
01:35:14,745 --> 01:35:16,649
Yes?

740
01:35:22,918 --> 01:35:25,655
On the train,

741
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:30,059
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

742
01:35:30,218 --> 01:35:32,400
did you mean it?

743
01:35:34,066 --> 01:35:35,772
Yes.

744
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:39,700
Basic rule: always call their bluff.

745
01:35:44,223 --> 01:35:45,730
No.

746
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:21,238
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.

747
01:36:21,397 --> 01:36:23,103
Yes, sir.

748
01:36:50,789 --> 01:36:54,073
Nothing. There is nothing here.

749
01:36:54,944 --> 01:36:56,843
Let's make another pass.

750
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,285
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

751
01:38:07,035 --> 01:38:08,539
Natalya.

752
01:39:05,793 --> 01:39:10,660
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

753
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:30,918
You wait for your turn.

754
01:40:02,691 --> 01:40:04,709
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

755
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:18,637
- Is the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

756
01:40:18,795 --> 01:40:21,802
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

757
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,849
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

758
01:40:53,773 --> 01:40:56,344
No wonder we couldn't see it.

759
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,779
Come on.

760
01:41:22,103 --> 01:41:24,793
The world's greatest cash card.

761
01:41:25,862 --> 01:41:28,552
It had better not be rejected.

762
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:32,058
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir.

763
01:42:37,162 --> 01:42:39,062
Kill him.

764
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:41,119
The man just won't take a hint.

765
01:42:42,741 --> 01:42:46,461
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

766
01:42:58,568 --> 01:43:01,140
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

767
01:43:01,298 --> 01:43:04,029
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

768
01:43:34,772 --> 01:43:37,067
Antenna in position.

769
01:43:39,718 --> 01:43:41,697
On my count.

770
01:43:41,855 --> 01:43:44,783
Three, two, one.

771
01:44:12,599 --> 01:44:14,498
God save the Queen.

772
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:35,627
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

773
01:45:57,848 --> 01:46:00,697
James. What an unpleasant surprise.

774
01:46:01,093 --> 01:46:03,981
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

775
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,593
Find her.

776
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,100
So, how is old Q?

777
01:46:15,891 --> 01:46:17,869
Up to his usual tricks?

778
01:46:18,898 --> 01:46:20,797
The watch.

779
01:46:25,308 --> 01:46:28,869
A new model. Still press here, do l?

780
01:46:41,733 --> 01:46:43,797
Interesting setup, Alec.

781
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:47,328
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

782
01:46:47,487 --> 01:46:49,829
then transfer the money electronically

783
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:52,845
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

784
01:46:53,003 --> 01:46:55,940
which erases any record
of the transactions.

785
01:46:56,654 --> 01:46:59,194
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

786
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:02,250
But it still boils down to petty theft.

787
01:47:03,242 --> 01:47:07,131
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

788
01:47:17,091 --> 01:47:19,631
You always did have
a small mind, James.

789
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:24,870
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

790
01:47:25,028 --> 01:47:29,632
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

791
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:31,775
criminal records.

792
01:47:31,933 --> 01:47:35,981
In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,

793
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:38,600
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

794
01:47:38,759 --> 01:47:41,497
A worldwide financial meltdown.

795
01:47:41,656 --> 01:47:45,823
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

796
01:47:45,981 --> 01:47:49,672
Please, James. Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you

797
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:54,156
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

798
01:47:57,371 --> 01:48:01,022
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

799
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:04,673
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

800
01:48:05,506 --> 01:48:08,800
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

801
01:48:08,959 --> 01:48:11,617
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

802
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:16,737
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya.

803
01:48:49,754 --> 01:48:52,968
Don't ever do that again.

804
01:48:53,127 --> 01:48:56,540
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die.

805
01:48:56,698 --> 01:48:59,516
You pathetic little worm.

806
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:02,572
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

807
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:06,619
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

808
01:49:07,135 --> 01:49:09,794
She works on the guidance system.

809
01:49:09,953 --> 01:49:13,405
She doesn't even have access
to the firing codes.

810
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:19,437
Retro-rockets firing.

811
01:49:36,502 --> 01:49:41,938
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in 1 2 minutes.

812
01:49:43,407 --> 01:49:45,827
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

813
01:49:45,986 --> 01:49:49,677
- Deal with it.
- She changed the access codes.

814
01:49:51,304 --> 01:49:53,605
Then she can fix it.

815
01:49:56,344 --> 01:49:59,756
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

816
01:50:01,026 --> 01:50:03,884
I can do it. I can break her codes.

817
01:50:04,042 --> 01:50:06,344
Then get on with it.

818
01:50:33,012 --> 01:50:34,996
Tell him. Now.

819
01:50:35,551 --> 01:50:38,567
Give me the codes, Natalya.
Give them to me.

820
01:50:54,163 --> 01:50:56,624
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

821
01:50:56,782 --> 01:50:59,005
Possibly?

822
01:50:59,163 --> 01:51:01,386
We have to destroy the transmitter.

823
01:51:01,544 --> 01:51:05,156
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

824
01:51:31,903 --> 01:51:34,800
Do you know how to use one of these?

825
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:37,935
Yes.

826
01:51:38,093 --> 01:51:40,197
Good. Stay out of sight.

827
01:51:54,245 --> 01:51:56,031
- How long?
- Two minutes.

828
01:51:56,189 --> 01:51:57,618
- One minute.
- Guard.

829
01:51:57,777 --> 01:52:02,063
- I'm fixing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

830
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,177
Yes. I am invincible.

831
01:55:27,467 --> 01:55:30,324
You know, James?

832
01:55:30,483 --> 01:55:32,269
I was always better.

833
01:55:44,796 --> 01:55:45,876
Alpha One to Gunship.

834
01:55:46,956 --> 01:55:49,355
Alpha One to Gunship.

835
01:56:47,548 --> 01:56:49,267
Speak to me.

836
01:57:22,983 --> 01:57:24,943
For England, James?

837
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:26,942
No.

838
01:57:27,862 --> 01:57:29,182
For me.

839
01:58:45,292 --> 01:58:47,611
Yes. I am invincible.

840
01:59:11,448 --> 01:59:14,768
James. James. Are you all right?

841
01:59:18,567 --> 01:59:20,767
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

842
01:59:30,526 --> 01:59:33,085
Suppose someone is watching?

843
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:37,525
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

844
01:59:37,685 --> 01:59:39,964
Yo, Jimbo.

845
01:59:48,163 --> 01:59:52,283
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

846
01:59:53,923 --> 01:59:56,082
It's tobacco plants.

847
01:59:56,242 --> 01:59:58,042
I said I'd be here, huh?

848
01:59:58,202 --> 02:00:00,322
Yo. Marines.

849
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:15,280
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo?

850
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,399
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

851
02:00:18,559 --> 02:00:21,399
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

852

Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?

853
02:00:58,434 --> 02:01:01,953
# I know you dream a lot

854
02:01:04,393 --> 02:01:06,993
# Holding on to lies

855
02:01:09,712 --> 02:01:12,272
# And you wait around

856
02:01:16,232 --> 02:01:19,711
# For someone to know where you hide

857
02:01:22,311 --> 02:01:25,670
# And in your dreams you feel a lot

858
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:31,350
# Though you keep it all inside

859
02:01:33,749 --> 02:01:36,709
# And you close your eyes

860
02:01:40,068 --> 02:01:43,188
# It helps keep you alive
