[Officer] This is
an important bust.

14
00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.025
We need it after Slater
fucked up that raid

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.196
at the strip club.

16
00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.830

Hi, Gary.

18
00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:42.201
[Officer] First
drug raid, Gary?

19
00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:43.003
Yeah.

20
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.572
We're coming up!

21
00:01:46.574 --> 00:01:49.007
I'll make the announcement
when we get inside!

move, show me your hands!

shit from the van

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.715
is a monster of a compound.

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:57.518
So what?

26
00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.421
Do you shoot it,
slurp it, or sniff it?

27
00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:05.257
Well, we're about to find out.

28
00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.226
Let's assume it's
very fucking potent

29
00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:08.494
and highly addictive!

30
00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.828

it did to that girl.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.132
and 29-9 means erase

are these fucks?

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.596
[Petro] Oursler,
Slater, check in.

51
00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.466
- Search warrant!
- We're seeing planes here.

52
00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:22.368
These guys could be
heavier-armed than we thought.

53
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.502
[Slater] Keep
this channel clear,

54
00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.337

tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

60
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.751
Track my signal.

61
00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:41.920
- The signal is the stimulant.
- Clear!

62
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.689
- The signal is the sedative.
- Clear!

63
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.924
[Woman] The
signal is salvation.

Oh, those fucking eyes.

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.972
[Officer] Hey,
I know this guy.

70
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.143
He owns the video
store on my block.

71
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.612
[Nash] This is
Brayberry, we founds some

72
00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:08.880
of that goopy shit
from the videotape.

73
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:12.052
We've also got a 419,
could be self-inflicted.

[Oursler] Are you gonna
keep crying, Slater,

77
00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:33.073
or are you gonna find
me some drugs in there?

78
00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.091
Police, search warrant!

79
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.759
[Spivy] Slater,
we've got bodies!

80
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.894
Maybe get another
tac unit on standby.

[tense music]

82
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.570
This is a crime scene,
do not touch anything.

83
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.738
Don't fuck with
my scene, Slater!

84
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.807
Slater, let's keep moving.

85
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.275
Got a lot of building to clear.

86
00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:11.612
We'll take the upper level.

87
00:05:14.415 --> 00:05:15.347
[Gary] Hey, I
don't think that girl

88
00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.150
from the videotape is in here.

89
00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.120
It's an information
superhighway that spans the globe,

90
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.189
and it is called internet,

91
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.992
or just the net
to frequent users.

92
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.260
Today millions of Americans
have personal computers

93
00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:32.097
and can access the net
for a modest monthly fee.

94
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.931
I think I'll stick to
my telephone for now.

95
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.401
[chuckles]

96
00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:38.370
And in local news, a number
of Westerville residents

97
00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:41.507
have come forward with
stories of a mysterious figure

98
00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.475
they're calling the Rat Man.

99
00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:45.176
Sounds like a
superhero, Camille.

100
00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.013
[chuckles] That is no
superhero I'd want to meet, Mark.

101
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:51.683
Eyewitnesses have said that
this man or man-animal hybrid

102
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.852
lives in the sewers
and comes out at night,

103
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.154
but if you shine a
light directly at it,

104
00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:58.123
it suddenly disappears.

105
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.026
Channel Six's Holly
Marciano has more.

106
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.161
Is he an urban legend?

107
00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.131
Or is there really a
creature of unknown origin

108
00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.966
lurking within the sewers?

109
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.368
I was just out here
taking a walk at night

110
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.240
and I heard it making
noises down there.

111
00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.845
And it looked up at me like a...

112
00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.980
A fucking clown.

113
00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.750
[Holly] This amateur sketch
resembles what many of you say

114
00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.552
the Rat Man looks like.

115
00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:29.187
Almost everyone has come
up with their own theories

116
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.492
and explanations for the image.

117
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.926
Yeah, my theory is the
dude's from the fucking prison

118
00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:38.063
in Athens for like
the criminally insane.

119
00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.330
That's where my cousin went.

120
00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.733
Yeah, her crazy-ass
cousin was in there,

121
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.703
so he's like an
escaped mental case.

122
00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:48.039
Oh, and he lives in the sewer
so that nobody can find him.

123
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.240
[bell tolls]

124
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.577
Well, I believe it's
a sign from Jesus.

125
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.780
It's time for
sinners and elitists

126
00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.249
to get what's coming to them.

127
00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.551
[Holly] Mm-hm.

128
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:02.053
So tell me, where did
you first see him?

129
00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:03.655
Right there.

130
00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.891
Behind me, that's
where I saw him.

131
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:06.727
Right there.

132
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.363
Okay, we're done.

133
00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.734
Thank you for your service.

134
00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:18.369
Fucking last time I need
to be in this forest.

135
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:20.205
[Jeff] We could have picked
an easier path, you know.

136
00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:21.408
There are no paths.

137
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.544
[Jeff] Yeah.

138
00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:29.116
So do you want more
B-roll of the forest?

139
00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.851
No, we have all
kinds of footage

140
00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:36.389
of the forest and the
mouth of the drain.

141
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.292
Jesus, Barry, what, what
does he want us to do,

142
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.228
walk through raw sewage?

143
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.032
No, I'm not being
dramatic, I just...

144
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.202
Yeah.

145
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:52.070
Yep, no problem.

146
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:52.971
Okay.

147
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:55.541
[phone beeps]

148
00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:56.942
[Jeff] Looking
a little stressed.

149
00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.579
You wanna get a
drink afterwards?

150
00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.047
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

151
00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:03.851
- Fuck you.
- Copy that.

152
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.257
[Jeff mutters angrily]

153
00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:14.092
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

154
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:15.527
- Westerville's very own...
- He said he might want it

155
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:18.396
from inside the
drain, though, right?

156
00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:19.865
Yeah.

157
00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.935
I mean, it's a health
hazard, look at it.

158
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.309
[Jeff] Where is it?

159
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.379
That guy's creepy.

160
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.283
Yeah, let's get
out of his eye line.

161
00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:42.988
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

162
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.224
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

163
00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:48.627
It's a mystery that
can only be told

164
00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:52.063
inside the cavernous
tunnels beneath our feet.

165
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.566
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

[eerie scraping]

167
00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:02.641
Construction?

168
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.511
- Let's go again.
- Yeah, going again.

169
00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:08.413
Hang on, just gotta get focus.

170
00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.684
And, all right.

171
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.688
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

172
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.658
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

173
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.360
- It's a myst...
- Uh, the hell is that?

174
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.595
Are you even,
what are you doing?

175
00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:26.297
[Jeff] No, no, no,
there's someone there.

176
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.135
- Seriously.
- Oh my god.

177
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.171
I don't have the time
for these shenanigans,

178
00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:35.306
can you with me
about something else?

179
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.277
[Jeff] Gimme a sec,
Holly, just hold on.

180
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:40.748
Hello?

181
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.487
[clears throat] Excuse me.

182
00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:53.761
Oh man, are you fucking kidding?

183
00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:58.031
[Jeff groans]

184
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.067
[Holly] What is it?

185
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:03.904
[Jeff] I don't know.

186
00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:09.877
Ah.

187
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.413
Yeah, it's just a bunch of junk.

188
00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.619
You think kids live down here?

189
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.020
[Jeff] I don't know if
you'd call this living,

190
00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:23.991
but yeah, I mean, it's possible.

191
00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:26.526
Jesus Christ.

192
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.930
You know, we are the
richest country in the world

193
00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:34.465
and we treat people like this.

194
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.402
It's shameful.

195
00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.540
We should record more of this.

196
00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:44.175
Right, evidence
of what it's like

197
00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:46.144
to actually live down here.

198
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.746
[Jeff] Wow, you are
really selling this, Holly.

199
00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.280
Don't be a dick.

200
00:10:49.282 --> 00:10:51.182
I'm serious, this
is a good story.

201
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.218
[Jeff] Don't you
have an AA meeting?

202
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.753
Fuck, I don't
want to sit around

203
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:56.454
and talk about my fucking
drinking problem, okay?

204
00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:57.723
Don't you want to do something

205
00:10:57.725 --> 00:10:59.457
that will make a
difference, Jeff?

206
00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.693
That will like, I don't
know, help people?

207
00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.594
[Jeff] Help you get
your Pulitzer, right?

208
00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:06.133
This is what we're
talking about.

209
00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.202
Holly!

210
00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:12.205
- Holly!
- Come!

211
00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:15.841
I need your light.

212
00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:17.709
[Jeff] Ah, fuck.

213
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.212
[Holly] Come on.

214
00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:30.290
[foreboding music]

215
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:57.148
What are you doing?
[Holly shushes]

216
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.285
[Jeff] What?

217
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.756
What's going on?

218
00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:06.792
I think someone's here.

219
00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:07.627
Come on.

220
00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:13.031
[eerie hissing]

221
00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:14.634
[Jeff] Holy shit.

222
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.810
Check, look behind you, check.

223
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.082
This must be where he lives.

224
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.350
[Jeff] Okay, so let's,

225
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.219
I don't think we should be
messing with this right now.

226
00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:35.420
We don't have to
mess with anything,

227
00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.824
just get some footage.

228
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:05.083
[roaring]
[Jeff screams]

229
00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:06.284
[Jeff moans]
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff...

230
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.652
[Jeff] Let's get
the fuck out of here.

231
00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.753
- Just calm down, calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

232
00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:09.754
Take a deep breath.

233
00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:10.788
I'm not, fuck.
[Holly shushes]

234
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.390
fuck, is that him?

235
00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:14.392
[Holly] It's okay, just
take a deep breath, all right?

236
00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.761
We didn't come this
far to get nothing.

237
00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:20.866
Just take a deep breath,
let me get your camera.

238
00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:21.701
It's okay.

239
00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.705
[Jeff] Okay.

240
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.006
- Give me a sec.
- Okay, good?

241
00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:29.140
[Jeff] Yeah,
just give me a sec.

242
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:29.977
Okay.

243
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.953
[Jeff] I'm ready,
do you see him?

244
00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:43.288
Yeah.

245
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.459
[shushes] Just relax.

246
00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:48.761
Hi.

247
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.564
Hello.

248
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.301
We didn't mean to scare you.

249
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.604
We're, we're friends, we just...

250
00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:01.808
We wanna ask you just
a couple of questions.

251
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.543
Is that okay?

252
00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.181
Okay, I'm gonna come
a little bit closer.

253
00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:12.819
Okay, okay.

254
00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.859
Can I ask you what your name is?

255
00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:23.361
Bill.

256
00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.197
Bill.

257
00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:27.267
It's really nice
to meet you, Bill.

258
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.071
I'm Holly, and that's Jeff.

259
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.375
Do you have a last name, Bill?

260
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.383
Are there other people that
live down here with you?

261
00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:49.222
Raatma.

262
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.025
[Holly] I'm sorry,
can you repeat that?

263
00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:56.027
Did you say Rat Man?

264
00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:58.565
Are, are you the Rat Man, Bill?

265
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.202
Okay, uh...

Thank you.

268
00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:11.542
I'm going to leave

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:13.344

I'm actually doing
a story on you.

292
00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:07.460
To show people that...

293

That you're just, you're just...

294
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.465

For all of your sins,
you could be saved.

358
00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:55.453
Holly Marciano with us
following her incredible rescue

359
00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:58.523
after she got trapped
in a storm drain.

360
00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:00.458
- [police siren wails]
- Okay, come on.

361
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.695
Come on, give me your hand.

362
00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:11.270
[Holly grunts]

363
00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.576
Gripping stuff.

364
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.411
And as I'm sure our
viewers are by now aware,

365
00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:22.947
we are very sad to report
that cameraman Jeff Wohl

366
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.882
has yet to be found.

367
00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:27.618
But Holly, we are so
happy to have you back.

368
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.622
Thank you, Mark,
it's good to be back.

369
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.557
It's the first day of fall,

370
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.692
and there's no better way
to kick off the season

371
00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:38.729
than with Westerville's 94th
annual pumpkin festival.

372
00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:41.432
People are already lining
up to Raatma the hay rides,

373
00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:43.067
apple Raatma, and of course,

374
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:46.072
to see who will be crowned
the festival's largest Raatma.

375
00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.009
[groaning]

376
00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.545
Okay, why don't we
cut to commercial...

377
00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:56.547
[Holly spits]
Jesus fucking Christ!

378
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:57.582
[crew members scream]

379
00:21:57.584 --> 00:22:02.422
[skin sizzles]
[Mark screams]

380
00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:16.233
[door opens]

381
00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:17.802
And in sports news,

382
00:22:17.804 --> 00:22:20.871
Ohio state plays the Indiana
Hoosiers tomorrow night.

383
00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:22.707
Good luck to our Buckeyes.

384
00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:25.612
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

385
00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:27.647
Hail Raatma.

386
00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:32.585
[emergency tone blares]

387
00:22:39.726 --> 00:22:41.692
[Petro] These super
labs can be booby-trapped,

388
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:43.728
proceed with caution.

389
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.031
[Nash] Could be no
one left alive in here.

390
00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:49.536
[Slater] You feeling
in over your head, Nash?

391
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.839
[Nash] Mind your own
fucking head, Slater.

392
00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:02.248
[eerie organ music]

393
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:11.155
[Spivy] I've got people,
there's people in here.

394
00:23:11.157 --> 00:23:13.724
[Slater] Blue Team,
we've got more DBs.

395
00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.394
Room full of bodies.

396
00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:27.404
[Spivy] Fuck me, I'm
calling for backup.

397
00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:30.441
No, not yet, let's
find the others.

398
00:23:30.443 --> 00:23:32.810
Hey Slater, what's your 10-20?

399
00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:34.078
[Slater] Fuck if I know.

400
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.380
Oursler and I got
fucking separated.

401
00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:41.285
Could be these bitches are
barricaded or got tipped off.

402
00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:42.855
Stay where you are.

403
00:23:44.557 --> 00:23:47.293
You know, if this thing
ever makes the news,

404
00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:50.029
and they ask for an interview,

405
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.633
I can do it, I
got a face for TV.

406
00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:01.140
[static crackles]

407
00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:08.748
[somber choral music]

408
00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:18.288
[Hailey] So with
these memorial videos,

409
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.158
isn't it usually just
like home movies?

410
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.794
We record our services
from time to time.

411
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:28.801
You haven't yet met the family
of the deceased, have you?

412
00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:32.002
They are, well,
the main point is

413
00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:34.539
we never question the
request of the client.

414
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:36.874
Grief is a personal matter.

415
00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:39.109
If the bereaved family
wants to include footage

416
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.381
of the wake in their memorial
video, we are happy to oblige.

417
00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:45.015
I assume they're
paying extra for this.

418
00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:47.217
That also, yes.

419
00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:48.220
Hand me the battery.

420
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.423
I've got it to program
for the cameras as well,

421
00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.325
so make sure you
keep this in CD mode,

422
00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.561
otherwise you'll eject a tape

423
00:24:56.563 --> 00:24:58.295
in the middle of
someone's eulogy.

424
00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:00.598
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, I parked out front.

425
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.633
The wake's going to begin
at nine, so I would suggest

426
00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:03.801
- you open the doors...
- Yeah, I already know.

427
00:25:03.803 --> 00:25:05.402
- Why's the casket crooked?
- Hm?

428
00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:08.405
I didn't place it like that.

429
00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:10.307
You know I didn't go near it.

430
00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.676
Maybe I bumped it.

431
00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:12.511
Whatever.

432
00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:19.283
Oh, Jesus, that's heavy.

433
00:25:19.285 --> 00:25:20.985
Well he was a big boy.

434
00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:23.420
Parts of him that
were left, anyway.

435
00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:24.622
Ronald, he's joking, right?

436
00:25:24.624 --> 00:25:27.357
The deceased was
in a severe accident.

437
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.693
It is a closed casket wake.

438
00:25:28.695 --> 00:25:30.828
- Yeah, I knew that, but...
- Don't worry.

439
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.229
I was more or less
able to get him back

440
00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:33.798
into his original shape.

441
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.803
Pity about his face and head.

442
00:25:38.204 --> 00:25:39.737
But the family wanted
him to put back together,

443
00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:42.439
and aside from that top part,
I'd say it's pretty good work.

444
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:43.674
But don't take my word for it,

445
00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:46.143
why don't you have
a look for yourself?

446
00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.645
You're gonna do great, Hailey.

447
00:25:47.647 --> 00:25:49.413
I'll be in early tomorrow
morning to relieve you,

448
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:51.749
so if anything serious
comes up, give me a call.

449
00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:53.620
And if it doesn't,
don't wake me up.

450
00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:10.102
[somber organ music]

451
00:26:31.057 --> 00:26:33.357
[Hailey] Yes, I was just
about to switch out the tapes,

452
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:36.827
but I feel dumb recording
myself just sitting here.

453
00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:37.697
I'm standing.

454
00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:40.798
[Ronald] Call me if
anything serious came up.

455
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.700
Nothing happening,
it's not serious.

456
00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:45.636
It's a wake, he's
not going anywhere.

457
00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:46.971
Maybe they got
caught in the storm,

458
00:26:46.973 --> 00:26:49.475
or maybe nobody liked the guy.

459
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.244
Okay, okay, sorry.

Hey Sharon, it's me.

463
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.049
I know it's late,
but if you're up,

464
00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:33.953
give me a call it
the funeral home.

465
00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:40.059
No one's here and I'm
working all night,

466
00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:43.462
and I had a quick
question for you.

467
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.331
Bye.

Hello?

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:27.073
I mean, Jensen Funeral Home.

474
00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:30.109
Hey, Sharon, yeah.

475
00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:33.479
Your mom still saves
the newspaper, right?

476
00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:36.380
No, I...

477
00:28:36.382 --> 00:28:38.048
No, that's fine.

478
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.485
Listen, would you mind
checking the obituary page

479
00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:44.957
in the last few issues for
a guy named Andrew Edwards?

480
00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:48.125
This is weird, but I'm supposed

481
00:28:48.127 --> 00:28:50.229
to be hosting his
wake tonight, and I...

482
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.230
Something like that.

483
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:56.266
Basically, just
in the past week.

484
00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.103
Yeah.

485
00:28:58.304 --> 00:29:00.239
Thanks, I appreciate it.

486
00:29:01.507 --> 00:29:02.341

I am fucking telling
you he's alive in there.

498
00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:35.825
He fucking moved, I heard it.

499
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:39.065
[Ronald] I promise you,
he is very dead, Hailey.

500
00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:43.400
If you can't handle one
under-attended wake...

501
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:44.503
Hang on, here's Tim.

502
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.609
[Tim] Hailey, kid, I assure
you that body in that casket

503
00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:54.611
is not capable of moving.

504
00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:56.280
All those stories
about people waking up

505
00:31:56.282 --> 00:31:58.082
are just urban legends.

506
00:31:58.084 --> 00:31:59.549
It's just gas is escaping

507
00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:02.019
or one of the other
hundred chemical processes

508
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:04.488
that can happen with embalmed
remains in the first 96.

509
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.290
We talked about this.

510
00:32:06.292 --> 00:32:07.659
[Hailey] Gas is escaping.

511
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.194
[Tim] It's just
you there, right?

512
00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:12.596
So go crack the lid
and take a peek.

513
00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:14.898
Seriously, I mean it, Ronnie
and I will stay on the line

514
00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.834
and you'll see it's
just a person's remains.

515
00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:19.203
Might look a little gross,

516
00:32:19.205 --> 00:32:21.440
but that's all it is,
and you'll feel better.

517
00:32:23.976 --> 00:32:25.109
Hailey?

518
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:26.843
No, you're right.

519
00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:29.679
It's just the remains
settling, I know that.

520
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:30.549
Sorry, Tim.

521
00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:33.817
[Tim] It's okay, kid.

522
00:32:33.819 --> 00:32:36.420
But don't call here again
tonight or Ron will fire you.

523
00:32:36.422 --> 00:32:37.256
Goodnight.

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:29.173
We met with a man
before, an old fellow.

534
00:33:29.175 --> 00:33:30.607
He's not here tonight?

535
00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:33.210
Oh, you must mean
Ronald, he's the manager.

536
00:33:33.212 --> 00:33:35.745
He'll be in tomorrow for
the funeral services itself,

537
00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:38.315
but I was given the
responsibility of the wake.

538
00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:39.718
Doesn't matter.

539
00:33:41.153 --> 00:33:42.886
Of course, I understand
very few could make it up

540
00:33:42.888 --> 00:33:44.088
in this storm.

541
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.292
There's a tornado watch,
something like this.

542
00:33:48.294 --> 00:33:49.495
I listen to the weather.

543
00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:52.562
May I?

544
00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:53.865
My gosh, yes.

545
00:33:56.502 --> 00:33:57.303
Here.

546
00:33:59.071 --> 00:34:00.806
Are you family, or...

547
00:34:04.743 --> 00:34:07.146
[man groans]

548
00:34:08.447 --> 00:34:12.118

549
00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.956
[Man] Thank you very much.

550
00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.724
Oh, do you need anything else?

551
00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:58.197
[Man] No, I paid
my respects in full.

552

Janssen Funeral Home.

556
00:35:26.592 --> 00:35:28.860
[Sharon] Hey, sorry,
I totally passed out.

557
00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:31.428
Don't sweat it, it's cool.

558
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.830
No one showed up to
this wake tonight.

559
00:35:33.832 --> 00:35:35.865
It's been kind of creepy,

560
00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.768
so I wanted to know the
deal with the dead guy,

561
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.540
but someone finally visited,
so now it's not as strange.

562
00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:45.875
[Sharon] Really,
someone showed up?

563
00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:46.878
What were they like?

564
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.347
Why?

565
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:51.548
I went and flipped
through the Tribune

566
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.217
for Andrew Edwards
like you said,

567
00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:55.319
but I didn't need to
look in the obituaries.

568
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.586
He was on the front page.

569
00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:58.322
- [thunder cracks]
- What?

570
00:35:58.324 --> 00:36:00.089
[Sharon] Andrew Edwards
is the name of the guy

571
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.592
who jumped off the roof of
that church down in Haysburg.

572
00:36:02.594 --> 00:36:04.294
You heard about that, right?

573
00:36:04.296 --> 00:36:07.063
He was on the roof for an
hour shouting crazy gibberish,

574
00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:08.532
and then he hit
the concrete steps

575
00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:10.702
right as families were
beginning to show up for...

576
00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:13.972
[Hailey] Hello, Sharon?

585

Mr. Edwards?

586
00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:20.737
Mr. Edwards, you've been
in an accident, okay?

587
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.839
And there was...

588
00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:25.875
There's some kind of a
mistake at the morgue...

589
00:37:25.877 --> 00:37:30.882
[Andrew snarls]
[Hailey screams]

590
00:37:49.535 --> 00:37:51.301

[Spivy] We're
fucking lost in here.

605

Oh god, there's
that smell again.

606
00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:28.860
It's worse than dead bodies.

607
00:40:30.028 --> 00:40:31.663

Petro, where the fuck are you?

613
00:40:55.153 --> 00:40:58.622
We've got another 419,
definitely not self-inflicted.

614
00:40:58.624 --> 00:41:01.390
We don't need more tech,
we need a gravedigger!

615
00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:02.992
[Nash] We're gonna need more
than just one gravedigger.

616
00:41:02.994 --> 00:41:05.330
This is gonna get nastier.

617
00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:07.298

[Slater] All officers
check in right fucking now!

622
00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:20.810
With radio interference,
this channel is not stable.

623
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:22.748
We have to find
an exit right now.

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:35.925
tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

629
00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:38.394
Track my signal.

630
00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:40.664
The signal is the stimulant.

631
00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:42.632
The signal is the sedative.

632
00:41:42.634 --> 00:41:45.070
The signal is salvation.

633
00:41:46.404 --> 00:41:48.607

are the true patriots who
have given blood oaths

816

to defend our way of life.

817
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.601

put down in the gutter.

from the face of this earth!

Now do I just press the button?

834
01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:53.314
[Bob] Press the red button.

835
01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:54.548

836
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.083

don't wanna fuck it up.

Thanks for the puddle, Steve.

841
01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:10.732
Do you copy, we got a
dash on this building.

842
01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:14.301
Looks like a security
entrance to the east side.

843
01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:17.404
Employee parking lot,
and it's not open today,

844
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.173
but guarantee on the
day it's gonna be open.

845
01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.242
[Greg] Copy that.

846
01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.976
I'm looking at...

847
01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.679
Got one security camera.

848

Two security
camera, three, four.

849
01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:30.752
We got definitely two X-ray
analyzers in the lobby,

850
01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.485
and maybe a retinal scan.

851
01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:36.658
I'll try to get some codes,
but if I don't, shit, guys.

852
01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.894
That was final.

854
01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.766
- Good job, good job.
- Good job.

855
01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:45.601
Okay.

856
01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.535
We can maybe walk the beast in,

857
01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:52.506
but I don't think they're open
until well after sun's out.

858
01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.307
[Bob] Does the front of the
building even get sunlight?

859
01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.743
If we miss our
weather window now,

860
01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.712
we're not gonna get sunlight
for a few months, Bob.

861
01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.046
[Bob] No, no, no,
no, we have to go now.

862
01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:00.247
[Jimmy] Maybe a bit drastic.

863
01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.548
We have to go in
there and hit them up

864
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:03.851
when the building's
full up, okay?

865
01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:05.119
[Man] Hell yeah.

866
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.087
They got a daycare.

867
01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:07.056
They got a daycare.

868
01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:13.096
Okay, um, pull out.

869
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.430
Oh shit, front door it is.

870
01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.667
You know, at least the street
runs past there, right?

871
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.769
[Bob] Oh, hang on a moment
here, Commandant, the...

872
01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:22.970
[Greg] Via loading dock.

873
01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.771
Oh, it's the
maintenance entrance,

874
01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.273
my cousin can get
us the passcode.

875
01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.744
Oh, nice, and the sun is
there most of the day, too.

876
01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:31.981
[chuckles]

877
01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:36.717
Well, gentlemen, this
is where we roll in

878
01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.387
and we detonate the abomination.

885
01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:15.122
[Greg] Go for eagle's nest.

886
01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:16.323
Package has landed.

887
01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:17.827
[Greg] Copy that, tower one.

888
01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.237
Hope you weren't waiting long.

889
01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:33.009
Work as much, but
there's plenty of it.

890
01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.112
Greg.

891
01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:43.384
Gotta say, you boys
don't fool around.

892
01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:46.087
I'm very impressed
with the security here.

893
01:18:46.089 --> 01:18:47.521
Dam right, we're tight as
a fucking drum, all right?

894
01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:50.357
Shut the fuck up, Jimmy,
you're out of order.

895
01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.761
My bad, sorry, Commandant.

896
01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:55.298
Well trained soldiers
you got there, Greg.

897
01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.903
It's Air Commandant
when we're in uniform.

898
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.939
Copy that, Air Commandant.

899
01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:08.244
Now your unit may be a
well-regulated militia.

900
01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:11.878
[men laugh]

901
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.483
But you ain't nowhere
near well armed enough

902
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.453
for the very necessary fight
you've got coming your way.

903
01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.289
My god, this is making
my fucking dick hard.

904
01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.557
[Bob] This is making
all our dicks hard.

905
01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.260
[Jimmy] Yeah, Bob, I
can see it from here.

906
01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.694
This will be more than enough

907
01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.931
to hold off whatever authorities
come at you after the op.

908
01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:31.164
Now if those Waco numbnuts

909
01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.000
would have had half
this hardware on hand,

910
01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:35.101
ATF would still be out
there getting chewed up.

911
01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.403
Bet you these were
just drinking up

912
01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:38.105
- that fucking Iraqi blood, huh?
- Oh fuck yeah!

913
01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.673
Fucking Desert Storm!

914
01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.275
Oy, desert buttfuck, Talon!

915
01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.476
No one at the police station

916
01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:44.711
saw you taking
any of this stuff?

917
01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:45.980
Nope.

918
01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:47.481
How's that?

919
01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:49.018
We got friends everywhere.

920
01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.685
You know it.

921
01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.619
Especially with a grease
stain like Clinton

922
01:19:53.621 --> 01:19:55.689
in the White House.
[man laughs]

923
01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:58.392
Lots of cops are
ready for you patriots

924
01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.330
to take the feds down, hard.

925
01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:08.101
[Bob] Could you say
something, Air Commandant,

926
01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.503
about how momentous this
moment is for the cause?

927
01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.773
With the weapons and all.

928
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.844
Cut.

929
01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:30.093
This is but a earthly arsenal.

930
01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:42.271
Well met, fellow warrior.

931
01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:44.673
This man here...

932
01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:49.243
This man heard Wu Tan's
clarion call to action

933
01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:50.313
and he did his part.

934
01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.715
He hath armed us for
conflict sure to come

935
01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:58.351
after the heroic act that
we have all given blood oath

936
01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.054
to undertake.

937
01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:04.926
We will topple the Patrick
V. McNamara Federal Building

938
01:21:04.928 --> 01:21:07.728
in the infested cesspit
of Detroit, Michigan.

939
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.232
- Fuck yeah.
- Fucking right.

940
01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.868
[Man] And you're
certain the weapon works?

941
01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:14.803
The creature?

942
01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:16.605
Of course.

943
01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.407
[Man] So you tested it?

944
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.713
[alarm rings]

945
01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:32.153
Someone turn off
that fucking bell!

946
01:21:32.155 --> 01:21:33.722
- There.
- Please, no.

947
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:35.624
Please.

948
01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.327
Please.

949
01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:41.530
Please.

950
01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:45.668
[gun fires]

951
01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:51.107
Jimmy.

952
01:21:57.713 --> 01:21:59.080
[Jimmy] Bucket.

953
01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.983
[Man] Come on, take that bit.

954
01:22:01.985 --> 01:22:03.417
[Greg] Don't get any on you,

955
01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:03.987
you don't know what that
shit's gonna do to your scent.

956
01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:07.456
Yeah, drain him.

957
01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.692
[Jimmy] Come on, bitch.

958
01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.061
Yeah, here we go.

959
01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.429
That's probably good enough.

960
01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.198
- [coyotes howl]
- Pretty cool eyes.

961
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.599
This one looks pretty cool.

962
01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.666
[Bob] Kinda evil looking.

963
01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.135
Oh shit, those coyotes?

964
01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.636
[Bob] Yeah.

965
01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:24.905
Okay, let's do this.

966
01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:25.741
Good girl.

967
01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.143
Good girl.

968
01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:31.712
Okay, Phoebe, this
is the good stuff.

969
01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:35.016
This is to redeem the soul
of the goddamn US of A.

970
01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:36.383
- Oh yeah.
- You understand me?

971
01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.519
Okay, get this for posterity,
can you focus this?

972
01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.087
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, let's get that.

973
01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.722
- Got it?
- Let's do this, yeah.

974
01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:44.860
Creature blood going
in, three, two, one.

975
01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:51.632
[Bob] Say something,
Air Commandant,

976
01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.636
on what we're doing here.

977
01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:58.372
Well, uh, I got
to thinking, Bob,

978
01:22:58.374 --> 01:22:59.940
that it would probably
be a good idea

979
01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:03.677
to test the ultimate weapon
before we're fully committed

980
01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.878
and running the mission.

981
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.282
[Bob] Smart, really smart.

982
01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.154
[Man] What's taking him so...

983
01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:13.587
Oh shit.

984
01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:15.556
Shit, here we go, here
we go, here we go.

985
01:23:15.558 --> 01:23:17.724
Run, boy, the sun is coming up!

986
01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:18.861
Everyone down, down!

987
01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:37.813
What in the actual fuck?

988
01:23:38.746 --> 01:23:40.314
- Jimmy!
- What?

989
01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:43.350
It's probably blocked
by the tree or something!

990
01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.319
Get in there, don't
be such a fucking...

991
01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:48.157
[explosion booms]

992
01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.393
[coughs]

993
01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:54.860
[Man] Fucking Christ.

994
01:23:54.862 --> 01:23:57.766
[coughs violently]

995
01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.836
[Jimmy] First martyrs
of the cause, baby!

996
01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:04.371
- It happened, it worked!
- It's gone!

997
01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:05.672
- What'd you say?
- It's gone!

998
01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:07.441
- What?
- Phoebe!

999
01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:09.077
- It's gone!
- It works!

1000
01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:14.517
[laughs]
[men cheer]

1001
01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:17.684
[Man] Fuck you!

1002
01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:18.521
Yeah!

1003
01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:21.588
[Jimmy] This fucking smoke!

1004
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:24.093
[alarm rings]

1005
01:24:27.463 --> 01:24:29.798
[gun fires]

1006
01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:36.570
All right, I give
the go-ahead, and...

1007
01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.874
And fucking boom!

1008
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:46.915
Um...

1009
01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:50.784
Fuck, Chuck, one second.

1010
01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:53.187
- Fuck.
- Sorry, sorry.

1011
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:54.621
They have to all go
down at the same time,

1012
01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:56.056
- otherwise these fucking...
- Sensor's just not

1013
01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:57.858
fucking going, Greg, I
don't know what's going on.

1014
01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.661
[Greg] Well then you go and
you get the part tomorrow.

1015
01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:02.831
Guess what, we're going
the day after now.

1016
01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:05.999
[Jimmy] Fuck!

1017
01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:07.668
Nothing can be left to chance,

1018
01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.173
we are stepping onto
the world stage here.

1019
01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:14.643
God in his infinite wisdom has
given us a boon for the ages.

1020
01:25:15.978 --> 01:25:20.483
A metaphysical super
weapon, living destruction.

1021
01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:26.955
I will not let
Christ the King down.

1022
01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:33.960
We must do his good
work with honor!

1023
01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:34.797
Yes, sir.

1024
01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:42.303
Well it looks like
it's one more day

1025
01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:46.575
until the fall of the
unholy American Empire.

1026
01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.847
But tonight,

1027
01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:56.318
tonight we will send off proper.

1028
01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:02.155
We will cleanse ourselves
before the retribution.

1029
01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:06.228
We will get cork
high and bottle deep!

1030
01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.932
We're gonna get fucking wasted.

1031
01:26:11.934 --> 01:26:13.166
Yeah!
[men cheer]

1032
01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.269
All right, yeah!

1033
01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:18.572
- Fucking...
- Commandant's private stash!

1034
01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:19.940
Oh, get it!
[men whooping]

1035
01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:22.175
[heavy rock music]

1036
01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.680
[men chatter]

1037
01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:28.882
[Bob] You gonna go piss?

1038
01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:30.182
- A piss?
- You taking a piss?

1039
01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.985
Are you gonna come
watch me take a piss?

1040
01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.387
[Bob] Yeah, you
want me to film it,

1041
01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:34.955
- you fucking perv?
- Yeah, fucking go ahead.

1042
01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:36.990
Hey, we're going to
the pissing hole!

1043
01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:40.294
- No, never rest, only pee!
- Yeah.

1044
01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:41.129
- Never rest, only pee!
- Only pee.

1045
01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:49.235
- [laughs]
- Holy, ah, I tell you.

1046
01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.637
Fucking...

1047
01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:53.173
[groans] Let me tell
you, these were fucking,

1048
01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:55.141
these are $12.

1049
01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:57.610
Oh, Jessie, what the fuck?

1050
01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.946
- I'll get, I'll get you.
- Oh shit!

1051
01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.982
I know how to use this.
[men shout drunkenly]

1052
01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:04.585
Oy, oy, oy, you're good.

1053
01:27:04.587 --> 01:27:07.387
[men laugh drunkenly]

1054
01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.256
- [Jimmy whoops happily]
- Bob, we need you, Bob!

1055
01:27:09.258 --> 01:27:11.557
- You need a drink, Bob.
- Bob's out!

1056
01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.094
- You need a drink.
- Bob!

1057
01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.797
- [men laugh]
- Give it to him.

1058
01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.164
[Jimmy] Your
camera is your mask.

1059
01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:21.234
- Camera is my mask?
- Why don't you have a drink?

1060
01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.735
[Bob] You're wearing
a literal mask.

1061
01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.204
- You have to have...
- I will have a drink.

1062
01:27:24.206 --> 01:27:26.940
- A drink.
- I've been working hard.

1063
01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.175
- Oh, you first. [laughs]
- You know what?

1064
01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.012
You're sick.

1065
01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:43.392
[Bob] Ow, ow.

1066
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.632
There he is.

1067
01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:52.335
Fucking fuck.

1068
01:27:53.802 --> 01:27:56.837
[Bob laughs]

1069
01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.005
Fucking pussy.

1070
01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:01.477
Steve.

1071
01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:06.415
[Bob giggles]

1072
01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.355
Steve.

[Petro] God can't
help you now, Slater.

1212
01:35:57.219 --> 01:35:59.319
Didn't you see that
last videotape?

1213
01:35:59.321 --> 01:36:01.556
I saw you in that last tape.

1214
01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.891
Slater's got some
explaining to do.

1215
01:36:04.893 --> 01:36:06.761
We've got some
explaining to do.

1216
01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:10.163
Fucking untie me!

1217
01:36:10.165 --> 01:36:12.400
We're lost in here
with fucking junkies.

1218
01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:15.802
You still think
this is a drug ring?

1219
01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:17.670
It's our videotapes
that are the villain.

1220
01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:20.640
Our videotapes are
gonna fuck you up.

1221
01:36:20.642 --> 01:36:22.077
It's more like a trance.

1222
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.715
Are you telling me that Spivy

1223
01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.885
is in a fucking trance!

1224
01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:33.854

What the fuck is all of this?

1227
01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:45.298
This is a far out
fetish film cult

1228
01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.269
of bootleggers pushing that
untouched, untouchable,

1229
01:36:49.271 --> 01:36:51.704
nastiest of the nasties.

1230
01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:55.307
Snuffing and fluffing,
cannibals, animals.

1231

Girls in white suits
fucking shit up!

1232
01:36:58.947 --> 01:37:02.883
We deal in contraband
content, strictly VHS.

1233
01:37:02.885 --> 01:37:03.952
Definitely illegal.

1234
01:37:05.253 --> 01:37:06.987
Oh my god, I didn't
think we'd get busted

1235
01:37:06.989 --> 01:37:08.590
by our own useless unit.

1236
01:37:14.296 --> 01:37:17.663
[Petro] Are you
ready for your closeup?

1237
01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.900
What the fuck
did you just say?

1238
01:37:19.902 --> 01:37:21.734
[Nash] We are the final girls.

1239
01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:23.303
You're our final kill.

1240
01:37:23.305 --> 01:37:24.637
[heavy rock music]

1241
01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:29.142
[Slater shouts angrily]
[Petro shouts]

1242
01:37:29.144 --> 01:37:31.713
[Petro grunts]

1243
01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:53.166
Some help here, Nash?

1244
01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:55.337
My camera's fucking stuck!

1245
01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:07.916
[static buzzes]

1246
01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:17.923
[Nash] This tape's
gonna be our best one yet.

1247
01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.261
