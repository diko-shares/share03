1
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.589
Come on, you blithering idiot.

2
00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:31.258
There's only 26 letters
in the damned alphabet.

3
00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:33.802
All you've got to do is put them
in the right bloody order.

4
00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.851
Write something.

5
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:42.894
Anything.

6
00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.039
Right.

7
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.041
Music.

8
00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:18.096
Charles!

9
00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.604
Think!

10
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.506
Charles!

11
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.508
Darling!

12
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.095
Charles, they can hear you in Timbuktu!

13
00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.851
Much obliged.

14
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.651
If you insist on living
like a nocturnal animal,

15
00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:15.445
at least be civil enough
to hide your tracks.

16
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.700
- Morning, Edith-
- Good morning, ma'am.

17
00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:23.245
He's finally gone through with it.

18
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.747
Yes. Scandalous, isn't it?

19
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.084
On the contrary-I think giving up
the throne for love is awfully romantic.

20
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.087
I'll have a grilled grapefruit
and a strong coffee, please.

21
00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.301
Mr. Condomine's asked for his eggs
to be brought over to his study again.

22
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:41.555
Given his mood, I hope
they're being served sunny side up.

23
00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.433
Here we go.

24
00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:49.354
Two soft-boiled eggs
for William Shakespeare.

25
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.691
What does Her Majesty want this morning?

26
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:56.236
- She's sticking to the Hollywood diet.
- Hollywood diet!

27
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.240
It'll take a lot more
than an exotic fruit

28
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.117
to turn her into Greta Garbo.

29
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.912
Don't dilly-dally in the garden, Edith.

30
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.749
He'll only send it back
if the toast is cold-

31
00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.639
I'm not a bad man.

32
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.726
I mean, yes, I like to flirt a bit.

33
00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:33.273
And the occasional flutter.

34
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.359
Excuse me, sir. Your breakfast.

35
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.498
Edith.

36
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.708
Yes, sir?

37
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.627
Would you remind Edna

38
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.839
that the word "toast"
is derived from the Latin "tostare",

39
00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.384
meaning to scorch or to roast.

40
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.094
Whereas this...

41
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:07.307
is a cold, hard piece of bread.

42
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.602
Apologies, sir.

43
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.816
Do you need anything else?

44
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.776
Divine intervention.

45
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:27.202
It's wonderfully patriotic, Harold.
You've really excelled yourself.

46
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:31.081
And I'm certain the judges will agree.

47
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:49.808
How was it so easy for you,
my Manhattan muse?

48
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:59.526
Charles, you really should be praying
to Cadmus and not decapitating him.

49
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.777
I'm sorry!

50
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.406
You've been commissioned to write
a 90-page screenplay,

51
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.866
not War and Peace.

52
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.785
I'm at my wits' end.

53
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.496
I don't understand
how it could be so problematic

54
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.790
to adapt a story you've already written.

55
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.628
I'm sorry, Charles. I just don't know
how long I can go on like this

56
00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:23.466
With you stuck in an imaginary world
and me alone in the real one.

57
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.052
I miss you.

58
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.514
I miss us.

59
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.058
So do I.

60
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:41.818
Look at that.

61
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.406
I just found it amongst some papers.

62
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:49.242
Sweet of you
to try and spare my feelings.

63
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.703
- And a little naive.
- Why?

64
00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:54.414
Because you imagine
I mind you thinking of Elvira.

65
00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.459
Well, don't you?

66
00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:01.755
No, I'm not in the least bit
jealous of her-

67
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.173
I just wonder, if I died,

68
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.343
whether you'd continue
to look at photographs of me.

69
00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:07.844
Darling.

70
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.223
You're not the dying type.

71
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.938
He's simply incorrigible, Violet.

72
00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.024
I found him mooning
over pictures of Elvira yesterday.

73
00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.150
Elvira?

74
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.737
He's been shirking work
and pining for the ex-wife.

75
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.784
Game, set and match.

76
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.789
There's really nothing
to feel insecure about.

77
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.334
Elvira may have been very attractive,
but the poor woman's gone.

78
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.544
As has the spark in our relationship.

79
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.129
Charles is a man.

80
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:46.383
You can't expect him to juggle
more than one thing at a time.

81
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.177
My advice,
leave him to worry about the words,

82
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.680
and find someone else
to shake your sheets-

83
00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.891
Come on. Don't be a prude.

84
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.103
One must be practical
for a marriage to run the course.

85
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.564
Do you remember what you learnt
in our last lesson, Mrs. Bradman?

86
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.443
Strong, firm grip. How could I forget?

87
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.830
So, what seems to be the trouble,
old chap?

88
00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.749
Things don't seem to be flowing
as they used to.

89
00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.378
Name me a wordsmith
who hasn't wrestled

90
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.839
with a bout of writer's block
once in a while, hey?

91
00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.885
The truth is, it's not just the words
that have dried up-

92
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.057
Big Ben's stopped chiming.

93
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.896
Mr. Peasebody's got stage fright.

94
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.940
You poor fellow.

95
00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.359
It's like playing billiards with a rope.

96
00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:53.825
Try a couple of these-
Should put some fuel back in your tank.

97
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:56.870
- What are they?
- Benzedrine sulphate.

98
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:01.291
Amphetamine.
Enhances cheerfulness.

99
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.043
Alertness.

100
00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:06.504
And as Violet will testify,
it does wonders for your libido.

101
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.591
Sounds too good to be true.
Is it habit-forming?

102
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.218
Not at all. Been using them for years.

103
00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:25.065
Slow down!
Charles, you'll give us both a coronary!

104
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.942
I've never felt more alive!

105
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:29.903
Why? What's happened?

106
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:33.740
I decided to take your advice
and look on the positives.

107
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.867
Surely it's better to be up than down?

108
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.994
I don't want you to exhaust yourself

109
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.206
before the medium show
at the theatre tonight.

110
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.459
Nobody in their right mind would waste
a perfectly pleasant evening

111
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.546
pretending to be fascinated by someone
holding a one-way conversation-

112
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:56.513
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats.

113
00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:59.974
This evening's performance
will commence in two minutes.

114
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.853
Isn't that your cook? And your maid.

115
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:09.901
Yes, so it is. Poor Edith. She's
been very taken with this sort of thing

116
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.196
since she lost her brother,
fighting the Fascists in Spain.

117
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:16.407
Primitive superstition
can be very persuasive,

118
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.785
especially
with the emotionally susceptible.

119
00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:38.638
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to an evening

120
00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:43.143
that will change your perceptions
of the world we inhabit-

121
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.857
That will answer irrefutably

122
00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:54.821
the question that has confounded mankind
since the dawn of time-

123
00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.245
Is there life after death?

124
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.248
No.

125
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.339
There she is.

126
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.976
Mesdames et messieurs,

127
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.979
bonsoir.

128
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:34.694
From the Great Pyramid of Cholula
in the west

129
00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.281
to Mount Taishan in the east.

130
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:43.870
From Whanganui-a-Tara in the south
to Uppsala in the north,

131
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.915
I have traveled the globe,

132
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.170
communing with gurus,
swamis and shamans.

133
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:59.177
These wise sages have guided me
to a deeper dimension,

134
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:04.140
where finally I experienced an epiphany

135
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:09.896
and broke through to the other side.

136
00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.616
I am certain that everyone here

137
00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:27.330
has sensed the spirits
of their departed loved ones,

138
00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:32.669
and I am certain we all wish
we could communicate with them again,

139
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:37.340
to say the things we never got to say.

140
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.133
- I've got it!
- Shh!

141
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.010
- Tonight...
- Sorry-

142
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:45.223
I will use a precious mystical gift

143
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.060
to make that possible.

144
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:51.646
Ooh! Bugger!

145
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.656
Madame Arcati.

146
00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.868
- It's a conjuring trick.
- How dare you?

147
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.246
Here, I told you, she's a fraud.

148
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.707
That's an outrageous accusation!

149
00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.334
I merely lost contact.

150
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.795
Charles was right.
It was all a put-up job.

151
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.797
Where'd he go?

152
00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:19.882
Please, please.

153
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:26.389
Madame Arcati has just been through
a very traumatic experience-

154
00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.557
Please just...

155
00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:33.438
Please, I would ask you to respect
her privacy at this difficult time!

156
00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.940
My giddy aunt!

157
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:44.324
I've told you, Mandeep,
I don't want to see a living soul-

158
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.786
My name is Charles Condomine.
I'm an award-winning writer.

159
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.622
And especially not the gutter press.

160
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.460
No, I'm not a reporter.
I write crime novels and screenplays.

161
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.296
Well, I can't abide fiction or fantasy.

162
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.924
Get out!

163
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.593
Madame Arcati?

164
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.722
I'm not here to question your integrity.

165
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.142
Faking an exotic accent
doesn't mean your gift isn't real.

166
00:14:11.642 --> 00:14:13.770
I fully understand that, like me,

167
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:17.648
you occasionally have to employ
a certain artistic license

168
00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.275
to entertain the masses.

169
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.653
They expect me to deliver a spectacle,

170
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.532
a transcendental miracle
night after night-

171
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.535
Of course.
There's no need to justify yourself.

172
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.454
I'm a believer.

173
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:37.668
I'm simply here to invite you
to conduct a private seance at my home.

174
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:42.298
Well, I'm not a traveling banjo player,
Mr. Condomine. I don't do requests.

175
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:46.511
Well, there might be
some influential guests attending.

176
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.973
Could be the perfect opportunity
to fend off any bad publicity

177
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.518
from tonight's unfortunate events.

178
00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:59.023
When were you wishing this
to take place?

179
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.150
Well, as soon as possible.

180
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.823
Then I suggest this Thursday,
Midsummer Night.

181
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.241
The solstice.

182
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.079
The sacred turning point of the seasons.

183
00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.084
Perfect.

184
00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:21.587
I told her how profoundly interested
I was in anything to do with the occult

185
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.256
and she blossomed like a rose.

186
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:25.425
Hosting an evening
with a professional charlatan

187
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.093
- sounds like a scream.
- Doesn't it?

188
00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:30.263
But will it get you closer
to finishing your screenplay?

189
00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.598
I need the old girl to show me
tricks of the trade.

190
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.559
That's what'll make my new hero unique.

191
00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.561
What's so unique about him?

192
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:37.770
- He's dead.
- Dead?

193
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:41.274
As a doornail. He's the victim
of a vicious unsolved murder

194
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.526
and communicates with the living
through a medium

195
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.862
who helps bring people back
from beyond the grave.

196
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.448
Maybe she could resurrect your career
at the same time.

197
00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:49.782
Daddy's on the warpath.

198
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:52.994
He's threatened to find another writer
if you don't deliver soon.

199
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.897
Is anybody there?

200
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.736
Is anybody there?

201
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.282
One rap for yes, two raps for no.

202
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.123
- Is that you, Maia?
- Who's Maia?

203
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.167
My spirit guide.

204
00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.794
She was Tutankhamun's wet-nurse.

205
00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:48.049
I do hope she's not still lactating.

206
00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.635
I would ask you not to be flippant,
Dr-Bradman-

207
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.515
She may be in Shambhala,
but the woman still has feelings.

208
00:16:56.349 --> 00:17:00.228
Please forgive me, Madame Arcati.
I didn't mean to cause offence-

209
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.587
Now we're getting somewhere.

210
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.593
Is it me you wish to speak to?

211
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.766
Is it Dr. Bradman? Or perhaps
one of his less-fortunate patients?

212
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.188
Mrs. Bradman?

213
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:49.402
Mrs. Condomine?

214
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.320
Behave yourself, Maia.

215
00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.448
Mr. Condomine?

216
00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.872
It appears there's someone who wishes
to speak to you, Mr-Condomine-

217
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:06.669
Do you know anyone who has recently
passed over to the other side?

218
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.755
Only my old literary agent,
but it's unlikely he'd make contact.

219
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.592
He owed me a fortune in royalties.

220
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:17.138
Are you Mr. Condomine's literary agent?

221
00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.853
No. I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

222
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:29.692
Is there anyone on the other side
you think of often?

223
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:40.661
No. Well, there's nothing for it.
I shall have to go into a trance.

224
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.457
This is the moment I hate.

225
00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.418
Are you nervous or...?

226
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.629
When I was a child, I used to be sick.

227
00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.633
Let's see. What have we here?

228
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:57.887
Brahms. No, that's too dark
and depressing.

229
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.931
Rachmaninov? No, too florid.

230
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:05.978
No, this is better. Always.

231
00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.189
Does it have to be that song?

232
00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:11.108
Well, Maia likes a tune
she can hum along to.

233
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.666
♪ Always

234
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:36.550
♪ I'll be loving you always

235
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.887
♪ With a love that's true

236
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.472
♪ Always

237
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.684
♪ When the things you've planned

238
00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.228
♪ Need a helping hand

239
00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.355
♪ I will understand

240
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.982
♪ Always...

241
00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:55.736
No!

242
00:19:57.154 --> 00:19:58.197
Crikey!

243
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.999
- What the devil's going on?
- Must be a power cut.

244
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:16.257
Madame Arcati?
Madame Arcati, can you hear me?

245
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:19.385
- Is she breathing?
- She's having some sort of fit.

246
00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:22.138
Please do something, Dr. Bradman.

247
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.020
- Thank goodness.
- What happened?

248
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.815
Apart from French windows
blowing open, nothing supernatural.

249
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.277
Well, something substantial took place.

250
00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:40.156
- I can feel it in my base chakra.
- Probably trapped wind.

251
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.994
No poltergeists at any rate.

252
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.329
Erm, any apparitions?

253
00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.206
Er, not that we saw.

254
00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.168
- What about ectoplasm?
- I'm not quite sure what that is.

255
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.628
A supernatural viscous substance

256
00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:58.215
that exudes from the body of one
in a spiritualistic trance

257
00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.511
and forms the material
for the manifestation of spirits.

258
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:05.389
No, I definitely would have
remembered that.

259
00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:09.894
I suppose should get going
before the storm rolls in.

260
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.772
Would you care for refreshments
before you return to your hotel?

261
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.275
No, thank you, Mrs. Condomine.
I like to travel light.

262
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.695
Congratulations, Madame Arcati.
It was a thrilling evening.

263
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.948
I'm well aware of the irony
in your voice, Dr. Bradman.

264
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.284
May I be so bold as to remind you

265
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.703
that modern medicine
is a recent phenomena

266
00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:33.292
and that physicians have found value
in scientifically inexplicable practices

267
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.628
since the beginning of civilization.

268
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.588
Quite so.

269
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.674
Well, good night, everyone.

270
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:46.347
I'm sorry so little eventuated. Probably
something to do with the cosmic flux.

271
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:50.017
Thank you so much for agreeing
to do this, Madame Arcati.

272
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.603
It's been an education
on so many levels.

273
00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.231
Merci, Monsieur Condomine.

274
00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:58.442
Et au revoir.

275
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:09.119
Shh! She might hear us.

276
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:10.955
I can't. Really, I can't.

277
00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:21.757
I can't quite put my finger on it,
Donald.

278
00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.928
I've never experienced anything like it
in my life.

279
00:22:27.137 --> 00:22:29.306
It genuinely felt as if...

280
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.394
something tremendous had happened.

281
00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:39.942
Well.

282
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.653
Maybe next time.

283
00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:46.198
Good night, my love.

284
00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:06.552
Did you get
everything you need for your screenplay?

285
00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:09.972
Everything and more.

286
00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:12.850
Not thinking of turning in
for the night?

287
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.602
What?

288
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:20.065
Wouldn't it be prudent to get down
the ideas whilst they're still fresh?

289
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:24.737
Yes, no. Absolutely.

290
00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:29.366
I shall, er, fix myself a drink
and dig in.

291
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.577
Carpe diem, darling.

292
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.997
Carpe diem.

293
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.832
Jesus Christ!

294
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.418
Charles.

295
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.130
What on earth have you done?

296
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:30.803
The room looks like a giant peach melba!

297
00:24:33.097 --> 00:24:35.474
And where's my Italian chandelier gone?

298
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:40.437
What?

299
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:53.033
God!

300
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.122
Hello?

301
00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:04.670
Please tell me you haven't ruined
the rest of the house.

302
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:05.713
No.

303
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:09.466
My Moroccan mosaics!

304
00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.843
Charles!

305
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:12.678
One weekend away

306
00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:16.056
and the whole place has had
the life and soul sucked out of it.

307
00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.767
This can't be happening.
I must be hallucinating.

308
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.561
Well, judging from the decor,

309
00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.605
I would say that's the understatement
of the century.

310
00:25:29.403 --> 00:25:32.281
I should've known
this wasn't down to you.

311
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.993
Who is she?

312
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.954
It's not what you think.

313
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:43.625
Please, do not humiliate
either one of us any further.

314
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:47.463
If you've got something to tell me,
be a man and spit it out!

315
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:50.424
Elvira...

316
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:54.636
- You're dead.
- How dare you?

317
00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:16.116
The last thing I remember is competing
in the South Downs Point-to-Point.

318
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:19.578
That's right,
and the conditions were treacherous.

319
00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:22.581
As with most things,
you refused to listen to reason.

320
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:25.793
Well, I couldn't miss
the most prestigious meet of the season.

321
00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:27.669
You paid the ultimate price
for your folly

322
00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:30.714
and fell at the final fence,
instantly breaking your neck.

323
00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:34.885
The whole episode was very distressing
for everyone involved.

324
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.472
Well, presumably not as distressing
as it was for me.

325
00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:40.641
They did rename the jump in your honor.

326
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:44.103
How thoughtful.

327
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:50.734
Well, I don't understand.
If I'm dead, then how and why am I here?

328
00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.153
I have absolutely no idea.

329
00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:58.450
- Maybe you're a ghost.
- What?

330
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:00.536
No!

331
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:03.539
- Please, don't get hysterical.
- Hysterical?

332
00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:06.166
Concerned, more like.

333
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:10.254
Procrastination is the thief of time,
Charles, and yours is running out.

334
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.548
- Who's she?
- My wife, Ruth.

335
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:14.133
Yes? Are you all right?

336
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.218
- I'm your wife.
- Not anymore.

337
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:17.636
Why? What's the matter?

338
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.556
I'm not speaking to you.
I'm talking to Elvira.

339
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:21.682
Elvira?

340
00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:24.101
Surely you can see her.
She's standing right next to you.

341
00:27:24.226 --> 00:27:26.436
What are you playing at? Elvira's dead.

342
00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:29.064
Why does everyone
have to keep saying that?

343
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:32.317
Elvira, darling, this is Ruth.
Ruth, darling, this is Elvira.

344
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.652
Are you drunk?

345
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:36.363
Ruth, Elvira is here with us
in the room.

346
00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.408
Madame Arcati must have summoned
her up during the seance.

347
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:42.327
Madame Arcati's a fraud.
You said so yourself.

348
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:46.957
I'm going to bed
and I suggest that you retire too.

349
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:50.711
Finally, some time to ourselves,
so we can get reacquainted.

350
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.838
That's a thoroughly immoral suggestion.

351
00:27:52.963 --> 00:27:56.967
I wasn't for a moment insinuating
we share a bed.

352
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:58.677
- No...
- I've come to terms

353
00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:02.097
with your recent inability
to perform in that department.

354
00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:06.643
I can't imagine you ever did
with that sourpuss.

355
00:28:06.768 --> 00:28:09.021
Be quiet!
You're behaving like a guttersnipe!

356
00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:13.442
It is your behavior, Charles,
that is unpardonable! Good night.

357
00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.569
Hooray.

358
00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:20.032
What a frightful woman. I can only
assume it was a marriage of convenience.

359
00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:27.998
I've gone mad. That's what it is.
Stark raving mad.

360
00:28:34.796 --> 00:28:37.674
It'll ruin your life if you allow it
to get hold of you.

361
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:41.261
Once and for all, Ruth, last night
had nothing to do with alcohol.

362
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:45.641
I wasn't in the least drunk. Something
very peculiar happened to me.

363
00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:49.228
A one-off psychic delusion,
likely brought on by work pressure.

364
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:52.689
A deadline doesn't explain why,
when I suggested you return to bed,

365
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:55.609
you said with a disgusting leer
that it was an immoral suggestion.

366
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.653
I thought I was talking to Elvira.

367
00:28:57.778 --> 00:29:01.240
If you were, it conjures up a fragrant
picture of your first marriage.

368
00:29:01.365 --> 00:29:03.575
My first marriage
was perfectly charming.

369
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.911
It's in the worst taste
for you to sneer at it.

370
00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:09.706
I'm not nearly so interested in
your first marriage as you think I am.

371
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.542
It's your second marriage
that's absorbing me at the moment.

372
00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:14.044
It's headed for the rocks!

373
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:21.885
Well, it's 155 over 99.
It is quite high.

374
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.265
I'm not surprised, given
the intensity of the hallucination.

375
00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:31.687
I genuinely believed Elvira
was in the room, talking to me.

376
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.313
She was as real as you or I.

377
00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:36.942
Probably best you stop taking
the tablets, old chap.

378
00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:41.863
Darling.

379
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:46.410
I hate to see you so upset.

380
00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:48.954
Please accept my heartfelt apology

381
00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:52.958
for anything untoward I might have said
last night... or this morning.

382
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:57.587
Apology accepted.
Let's never mention it again.

383
00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.464
How are you feeling?

384
00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:04.177
Yeah, I believe Dr. Bradman
might have solved the riddle.

385
00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:06.638
Well, thank goodness.

386
00:30:06.763 --> 00:30:09.474
Now, let's go and see your father.

387
00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:12.811
I want to check he likes my new idea
before committing it to the page.

388
00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:14.479
I do not want to be late.

389
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:28.493
Charles?

390
00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:35.625
So, you see, Henry,
it's only through the medium

391
00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:37.419
that the killer
can be brought to justice

392
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:40.047
based on new evidence
that he gathers from beyond the grave.

393
00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:44.676
I like the premise, but not enough to
wait another six months to see a script.

394
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:48.555
Charles will deliver in a few weeks,
Daddy. You have my word.

395
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.475
And mine.

396
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.893
Cut!

397
00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:55.437
Right, come on.
Let's watch the next scene.

398
00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:58.690
I think Hitch will be
the perfect director for our film.

399
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:00.567
Just don't get under his feet.

400
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.736
Come on, darling.

401
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:07.991
Googie, how lovely to see you.

402
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:11.078
- Charles Condomine.
- I'm a big fan of your books.

403
00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:14.664
When can we expect Detective Flowers
to crack his next case?

404
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.086
Charles has actually made the leap
into screenwriting with Daddy's help.

405
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:23.673
How exciting! I'd die to play one
of your strong-willed female characters.

406
00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:26.176
Where do you draw your inspiration from?

407
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:31.139
- Where do you think?
- How romantic, to marry your muse.

408
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:33.683
Not so romantic to replace her.

409
00:31:34.684 --> 00:31:36.395
Why don't you tell her the truth?

410
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.565
- That you're an astral bigamist.
- Be quiet. Stop behaving like a harlot.

411
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.235
I beg your pardon?

412
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.614
Admit it, Charles. All of your female
characters are based on me.

413
00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.117
You always were vain and self-obsessed.

414
00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:52.786
How dare you speak
to my leading lady like that?

415
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:55.372
No, no, no, no.

416
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:02.045
Get a grip, Charles.
What on earth is going on?

417
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.839
Elvira is here.

418
00:32:05.215 --> 00:32:08.135
I can see her. She's right there.

419
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:11.680
I insist you go home immediately
and lie down.

420
00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:14.433
I have no desire to go to bed
in the afternoon.

421
00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:16.143
My, how things have changed.

422
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:20.856
I remember a time when we could barely
drag ourselves out of our double divan.

423
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:23.567
Stop being indecent.
Get out of my sight.

424
00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:26.570
How dare you speak
to my daughter like that?

425
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:29.114
- I wasn't speaking to her.
- Get off my set.

426
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.159
- You're in trouble.
- Don't be so infantile.

427
00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:34.828
I'll give you infantile!

428
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.539
Ooh!

429
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.086
Does it hurt?

430
00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.090
- Only if I breathe.
- Let me see it, darling.

431
00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:51.136
- What about now?
- God!

432
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.055
I suggest you take yourself
to your study.

433
00:32:54.181 --> 00:32:55.807
The only way my father will forgive you

434
00:32:55.932 --> 00:32:57.893
is if you deliver
an Oscar-worthy script.

435
00:32:58.018 --> 00:32:59.561
How am I supposed to write
in this state?

436
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:03.648
You'd better try. Either start typing
and prove you're not barking mad,

437
00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:05.734
or I'll be forced to call Dr. Bradman

438
00:33:05.859 --> 00:33:08.528
and have you referred
to a nerve specialist.

439
00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.907
Ruth, I'm not in the least neurotic
and never have been.

440
00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:14.701
Well, a psychoanalyst, then.

441
00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:17.787
I refuse to endure months
of expensive humiliation,

442
00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:21.541
only to be told that at the age of four,
I was in love with my rocking horse.

443
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.418
Don't take that flippant tone with me.

444
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:27.255
- I'm not the one who's seeing things.
- You do believe me then.

445
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.550
Of course I don't. There's no such thing
as ghosts or ghouls.

446
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:48.777
I call upon Donald Keeling,

447
00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:57.244
second lieutenant in the 92nd Regiment
of Gordon Highlanders,

448
00:33:58.411 --> 00:34:03.959
who died on February 27th, 1881,

449
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:07.212
at the Battle of Majuba Hill.

450
00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:13.635
Come forth
and make yourself known to me...

451
00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:20.475
Cecily, your ever-devoted wife.

452
00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:28.984
Donald!

453
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.236
Is that you?

454
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.198
It's housekeeping.
Do you need fresh towels?

455
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:56.177
What are you doing here?

456
00:34:56.303 --> 00:35:00.557
Despite removing every trace of me,
this is still my home.

457
00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:04.603
Besides, I have no idea how to get back,
even if I wanted to.

458
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.855
Are you saying
you're staying indefinitely?

459
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.442
Why? Would you hate it so much if I did?

460
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:14.112
Honestly, Charles,
I really am a little hurt.

461
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.364
You're the only one
who could have called me back.

462
00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:19.659
I most emphatically
did not send for you, Elvira.

463
00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:31.671
Ruth and I are about to celebrate
our fifth wedding anniversary together.

464
00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:34.716
Five? What is that, leather?

465
00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:38.595
- Wood.
- Watch out for the splinters.

466
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.475
Mrs. Condomine!

467
00:35:56.696 --> 00:36:00.408
I'll call Dr. Bradman, see if
he'll accompany us to the sanatorium.

468
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:03.161
Ruth, please listen to me.
I haven't gone mad.

469
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.915
The ghost of my first wife. Elvira,
has crossed over from the other side

470
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.876
- and is in the room with us right now.
- Yes, dear.

471
00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:12.170
I know, I see her perfectly well,

472
00:36:12.295 --> 00:36:16.257
along with the zebras and chimpanzees
hiding under the piano.

473
00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:18.385
Ruth, I have always looked upon you

474
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.346
as a woman of perception
and understanding.

475
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:23.682
I am,
but if you say you're not drinking,

476
00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:26.643
there must be something
pressing on your brain.

477
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:29.896
Elvira, do something to reveal
that you really are here. Please!

478
00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.773
She's going to have me committed.

479
00:36:33.566 --> 00:36:36.778
Do you remember
when we first heard our song, Charles?

480
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.531
♪ I'll be loving you

481
00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:41.658
♪ Always, ooh

482
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.009
See? What did I tell you?

483
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:05.265
It's a cruel trick, using some sort of
autosuggestion or hypnotism to scare me.

484
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.101
It isn't. I swear it isn't. Darling!

485
00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:13.732
Darling! Elvira, do something else,
for God's sake.

486
00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:15.525
Anything to oblige.

487
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.697
Look.

488
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.036
What?

489
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:36.379
Adios, interloper.

490
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:40.300
Oops.

491
00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:47.557
I'm afraid we need the room back.

492
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:51.436
I've told you, I'll be packed
and ready to go within an hour.

493
00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:08.828
Thank God I caught you.

494
00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:12.457
You are my only hope.
Something terrible has taken place.

495
00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:14.959
You heard strange noises in the night?

496
00:38:15.585 --> 00:38:19.756
Boards creaking, doors slamming?
A subdued moaning in the passages?

497
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:22.592
Er, no, none of those.

498
00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:25.637
But it appears that after the seance,

499
00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:30.558
my husband's first wife, Elvira,
who died seven years ago,

500
00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:31.976
is back among us.

501
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:33.561
At last!

502
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.440
A genuine materialization.

503
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.945
I knew something stupendous
had happened to me that night.

504
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.447
I felt it in my spinal cortex.

505
00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:48.618
After all these years of...
of spiritual devotion,

506
00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:51.496
I've finally been rewarded.

507
00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:55.208
I appreciate the pride
in your achievement,

508
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.626
but I would like to point out,

509
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.753
it's making my position
in my home untenable,

510
00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:01.047
and I hold you entirely responsible.

511
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.551
Forgive me, Mrs. Condomine.

512
00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:06.678
I'm being abominably selfish.

513
00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:08.888
Just to let me get this clear
in my mind,

514
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:13.184
you yourself have not seen
this manifestation?

515
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:17.981
No, but Charles claims
he can see and talk to her.

516
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:23.069
Well, if the emotional connection
is strong, that is sometimes possible.

517
00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:24.696
What?

518
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:31.119
It can sometimes develop
into a level ten,

519
00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:34.622
something I've never even dared
dream of.

520
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.837
Can he, by any chance, touch her?

521
00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:45.049
I sincerely hope not.

522
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:49.304
Why? Can that happen?

523
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:52.974
Well, if the returning spirit
feels welcome,

524
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:57.020
it can gradually

525
00:39:57.145 --> 00:40:01.816
become physically substantial.

526
00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:04.402
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman.

527
00:40:04.527 --> 00:40:07.030
Please do let me know
if you hear from her.

528
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.785
She's not there either.

529
00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:17.332
I remember when you couldn't wait
to spend an afternoon alone with me.

530
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.669
Please refrain from playing with
my affections. I feel strange enough.

531
00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:25.757
- So, you do still find me attractive?
- Elvira, please.

532
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:27.926
This is inappropriate.

533
00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.219
Look into my eyes...

534
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:35.642
and tell me you don't love me anymore.

535
00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:39.938
I shall always love the memory of you.

536
00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:43.107
Memories are about the past, Charles,

537
00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:47.236
but I'm here, and this is the present.

538
00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:52.408
Why don't we take the boat out
like we used to and get some air?

539
00:40:55.078 --> 00:40:57.372
I can't, I'm on a deadline.

540
00:40:58.331 --> 00:41:00.041
What are you writing, checks?

541
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:01.793
I'll have you know,

542
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:04.629
I've been commissioned to adapt
my first novel for the screen.

543
00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:07.048
Your first novel?

544
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:11.511
Nearly wore my fingers to the bone
committing this story to the page.

545
00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.721
Let's face it, darling,

546
00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:17.892
it's not a coincidence that you haven't
published a word since my demise.

547
00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:21.354
I won't deny
you did have a flair for plot.

548
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.398
And character.

549
00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:25.400
And?

550
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:27.902
- And dialogue.
- Right.

551
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.994
The biggest problem you have
is the twist into the third act.

552
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:39.831
It isn't dramatic enough, which is why
you don't have a satisfying climax.

553
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:41.457
Tell me something I don't know.

554
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.918
Wouldn't it be smarter
to flip the whole thing on its head

555
00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:45.712
and reveal the husband as the killer?

556
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:47.839
That's good.

557
00:41:47.964 --> 00:41:52.135
Or what would be more interesting
is if it's the wife who set him up.

558
00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:55.638
Why would the wife send her husband
to the gallows?

559
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:59.100
It's obvious, darling. Susan Rutherford
becomes the prime suspect

560
00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:01.394
when her alibi fails to materialize.

561
00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:03.604
We naturally assume
that she's trying to protect

562
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.481
the reputation of the foreign secretary

563
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:08.151
whose aspirations
of becoming the prime minister

564
00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:12.488
would be severely compromised if it was
revealed that he was having an affair.

565
00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:15.783
But, in reality, nothing could be
further from the truth,

566
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:17.910
which is what we learn
from the victim himself.

567
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.413
And it's only through the medium
that they can work it out.

568
00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.207
Work what out?

569
00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:25.710
That she's pregnant
with the dead foreign secretary's child.

570
00:42:27.587 --> 00:42:30.006
That's good.

571
00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:33.468
Even I didn't see that one coming.

572
00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:37.847
Of course you didn't, darling.
You're just the writer.

573
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.350
I'm afraid, Mrs. Condomine,

574
00:42:41.476 --> 00:42:44.479
that the time has come
for me to admit quite frankly

575
00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:47.648
I haven't the foggiest idea
how to send her back.

576
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:50.610
I have my own personal reasons

577
00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:53.613
for wishing to communicate
with the departed,

578
00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:55.281
but I never for a moment

579
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:58.117
considered the possibility
of having to send someone back.

580
00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.620
Well, I suggest that you find a way.

581
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.248
I refuse to share my husband
with anyone,

582
00:43:04.373 --> 00:43:06.834
especially his dead ex-wife.

583
00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:08.586
If I had thought for a moment

584
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:13.091
that your husband wished to get in touch
with the spirit of his dead ex-wife,

585
00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:15.510
I would have of course
consulted you first.

586
00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:17.178
After all, noblesse oblige.

587
00:43:17.303 --> 00:43:20.139
He had no intention of getting
in touch with her, I can assure you.

588
00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:24.727
The whole thing was planned in order for
him to get material for his new project.

589
00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:28.314
Am I to understand I was invited
in a spirit of mockery?

590
00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:31.692
He merely wanted to make some notes
of the tricks of the trade.

591
00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:35.404
Tricks of the trade?
I've never been so insulted in my life.

592
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.448
I'm sorry if that all came out wrong.

593
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:39.617
I'm rather overwrought
with the whole affair.

594
00:43:40.493 --> 00:43:44.288
Please, I implore you to help us.

595
00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:49.627
I will go to the Spiritual Alliance
on my way back to Sussex

596
00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.420
and ask them for guidance.

597
00:43:51.546 --> 00:43:55.967
Sussex? You can't abandon us
in our hour of need.

598
00:43:56.092 --> 00:44:00.221
Well, due to my recent circumstances,
I can no longer afford to stay here,

599
00:44:00.346 --> 00:44:01.931
but you can contact me.

600
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:06.185
I can cover your hotel bill
and any expenses

601
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.813
till this terrifying ordeal
has been resolved.

602
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.739
"Susan Rutherford
leans over the foreign secretary."

603
00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:20.783
Don't stop.

604
00:44:20.908 --> 00:44:25.663
"'The Soviet Union can wait, '
says the foreign secretary.

605
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:29.292
He turns and looks at Susan longingly.

606
00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:32.712
'This can't..."'

607
00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:34.463
"he whispers urgently.

608
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.925
And then..."

609
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.011
"he starts to slowly...

610
00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:44.724
unbutton her silk blouse,

611
00:44:45.308 --> 00:44:50.229
as they start to passionately kiss."

612
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:55.735
OK, that takes us
up to the first-act turn.

613
00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:00.239
You can't just stop mid-flow!

614
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:03.326
I'm tired. And I'm thirsty.

615
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:06.913
And I want to go into town
and drink negronis like we used to.

616
00:45:07.622 --> 00:45:09.040
But it's getting late.

617
00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:13.586
You really have got a little too
comfortable in your slippers, Charles.

618
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:45.826
What do you want, Elvira?

619
00:45:45.952 --> 00:45:46.994
Want?

620
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.788
I don't know what you mean.

621
00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.874
I remember whenever
you got overwhelmingly demure,

622
00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:53.918
it usually meant
that you wanted something.

623
00:45:54.043 --> 00:45:56.504
It's horrid of you to be so suspicious.

624
00:45:56.629 --> 00:45:59.966
All I want is to be alone with you.

625
00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:04.637
I can't deny, I do feel rather peculiar
seeing you again.

626
00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:09.642
I've missed you more than life itself.

627
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.353
I've missed you too.

628
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.690
My American dream.

629
00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:23.531
I was utterly heartbroken
after the accident.

630
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:31.497
The truth is, I don't believe
I ever really got over losing you.

631
00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.043
Do you love Ruth?

632
00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:38.879
Of course I do.

633
00:46:40.798 --> 00:46:42.883
As much as you loved me?

634
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:46.053
Don't be silly.

635
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:50.266
It's entirely different.

636
00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:54.228
I'm so glad.

637
00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:58.566
Nothing could've ever been
quite the same, could it?

638
00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:07.700
Let's go to Soho.

639
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.580
Swap those slippers
for some dancing shoes.

640
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.113
Slow down!

641
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:49.700
- I think I'm going to be sick!
- Charles!

642
00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.665
I love being back
behind the wheel of a car!

643
00:47:56.791 --> 00:47:58.751
I can't say the feeling's mutual.

644
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:02.505
Charles? Where on earth have you been?
I've been worried sick.

645
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.632
It's too bad it's not terminal.

646
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:08.302
I wanted to clear my head,
so I took a long drive.

647
00:48:08.427 --> 00:48:09.970
In the passenger seat?

648
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:13.516
Let's not quarrel
when we should be celebrating.

649
00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:18.187
I finished the first act
of my screenplay, and it's rather good.

650
00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:19.855
My screenplay, more like.

651
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.483
How did you manage that in a day?

652
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.779
- Elvira helped me.
- Do you mean to tell me

653
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:30.324
that not only has she bullied her way
back over the threshold,

654
00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:32.576
she's trying to work with you now
as well?

655
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:36.122
What do you mean, trying?
I've written 15 books in your name.

656
00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:38.332
Elvira, this is neither the time
nor the place.

657
00:48:38.457 --> 00:48:40.543
This is intolerable.

658
00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:44.088
- Elvira, now, you listen to me.
- Darling...

659
00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:46.173
- I... Yes?
- She's over there.

660
00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:48.050
Right.

661
00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:53.472
Now, listen here, Elvira,

662
00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:57.309
I've been to see Madame Arcati,
and she's going to send you back

663
00:48:57.435 --> 00:49:00.479
to wherever it is
she regrettably dragged you from.

664
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.524
Charles? Charles?

665
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.153
Don't.

666
00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.501
Darling, please don't be upset.

667
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.671
Upset? You've just spent the night
with your ex-wife.

668
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.048
How do you expect me to feel?

669
00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:30.176
Ecstatic.

670
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:34.638
Our dream of going to Hollywood
is finally within our grasp.

671
00:49:34.763 --> 00:49:36.265
As soon as I deliver the screenplay,

672
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.644
we'll be crossing the Atlantic quicker
than you can say Sunset Boulevard.

673
00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:45.274
Think of the glitz, the glamour,

674
00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:48.819
the good times we're going to share.

675
00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:52.239
You won't be reading
about other people's lives anymore.

676
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:54.158
They'll be reading about ours.

677
00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:06.670
And you can't do it without her?

678
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:12.301
Of course I can. It will just be
a lot quicker this way.

679
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:17.765
There's really no need
for you to be jealous.

680
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:20.476
You're the one I love.

681
00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:24.772
Forgive me that I don't tell you enough.

682
00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:32.988
Now that the words are flowing,
I feel unblocked in other areas too.

683
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:41.205
Promise me you can't touch her.

684
00:50:43.749 --> 00:50:47.211
Darling... she's a ghost.

685
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:52.424
And, besides, the only woman
I want to touch is you.

686
00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:35.467
Listen here, lady.

687
00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:39.054
You may have summoned me
into this world,

688
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:42.933
but there's no way I'm going to let you
send me back again.

689
00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:47.646
I'm here to stay. Is that clear?

690
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.476
How dare you ignore me,
you meddling old crone?

691
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:29.438
Either you leave me in peace
to live my life,

692
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:32.399
or I'll haunt you until the day you die.

693
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:47.122
The tower. Symbol of chaos,

694
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:52.461
destruction and devastation.

695
00:53:05.641 --> 00:53:07.518
Wakey-wakey.

696
00:53:07.643 --> 00:53:09.311
Rise and shine.

697
00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.731
What was I, Charles?

698
00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.525
The warm-up act?

699
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:19.405
If I was you, I'd keep it there.

700
00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:25.786
Good afternoon, ma'am.

701
00:53:25.911 --> 00:53:27.830
I'm going to have to correct you, Edith.

702
00:53:27.955 --> 00:53:30.791
It's not a good afternoon,
it's a glorious one.

703
00:53:32.209 --> 00:53:35.546
- Should I prepare lunch?
- Yes, please. You read my mind.

704
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:36.922
I'm absolutely famished.

705
00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:40.884
I'll have a cheese and pickle platter,
with extra pickle.

706
00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:42.970
Yes, ma'am.

707
00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:50.018
- What happened to your leg?
- I slipped down the staircase.

708
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:52.688
You really must refrain
from doing everything at the double.

709
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:54.398
You're not in the navy, you know.

710
00:53:54.523 --> 00:53:59.111
I wasn't hurrying, ma'am. There was axle
grease smeared all over the top step.

711
00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.869
Yes, her agent loves the pitch.

712
00:54:06.994 --> 00:54:09.496
Thinks it would be
a perfect vehicle for her.

713
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:11.832
- Seriously? Greta Garbo?
- Yes.

714
00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:15.169
Mata Hari speaking my words
would be a dream come true.

715
00:54:15.294 --> 00:54:18.714
- Charles, are you still on track?
- Yes, absolutely still on track.

716
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:22.217
I'll send the next ream of pages over
as soon as I reach the second-act turn.

717
00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:23.969
- Don't let me down.
- Thank you, Henry.

718
00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.680
And I appreciate
your continued patience and belief.

719
00:54:26.805 --> 00:54:28.223
- Splendid.
- Goodbye.

720
00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:21.944
- Elvira, what are you doing?
- "Greta Garbo speaking my words"?

721
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:25.572
Darling, what am I supposed to say?
That I've got a ghost writer?

722
00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:29.243
Stop it. Elvira,
that's one of our wedding gifts.

723
00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:31.870
Not ours, Charles. Hers!

724
00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:40.295
You care more about breaking china
than you do about breaking my heart.

725
00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:47.135
Elvira, I was unwaveringly loyal
and faithful to you

726
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:48.804
in all our years of marriage.

727
00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:50.848
What was I supposed to do
after you died?

728
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:54.309
Become a recluse and wear a black
armband for the rest of my life?

729
00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:03.277
- Ma'am, the garden judges are here.
- Thank you, Edith.

730
00:56:16.248 --> 00:56:18.625
We've been sabotaged.

731
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:38.520
That is an outrageous suggestion.

732
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:41.106
As the national director
of the Spiritual Alliance,

733
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.651
my job is to protect the reputation
of genuine psychic practitioners,

734
00:56:44.776 --> 00:56:46.153
not undermine them.

735
00:56:46.278 --> 00:56:49.489
And I vow, along with my friend,
Harry Houdini,

736
00:56:49.615 --> 00:56:53.327
to investigate and expose
every fraudulent spiritualist

737
00:56:53.452 --> 00:56:55.120
operating in this country.

738
00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.122
Come in.

739
00:56:58.457 --> 00:57:01.627
- Madame Arcati here to see you.
- Thank you for your time.

740
00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:06.173
Yes. Well, no, thank you.
Always a pleasure to talk to the press.

741
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:07.341
Goodbye.

742
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.928
You've got a cheek, showing your face
while you're suspended.

743
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:15.891
I'm sorry to turn up unannounced,
but I urgently need your guidance.

744
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.979
I have pulled off
a level-ten manifestation.

745
00:57:22.064 --> 00:57:25.025
And was this before or after
you conned 800 people

746
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.652
into paying to see you levitate?

747
00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:28.445
No, really, you must believe me, Harry.

748
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.823
And it is possible this presence
has a physical form.

749
00:57:34.743 --> 00:57:37.412
- Margot, where are the scissors?
- Drawer.

750
00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:39.915
So, you're telling me

751
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.711
that the first level-ten manifestation
reported in over three centuries

752
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:47.214
was the result of an ordinary
common-or-garden seance?

753
00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:49.049
Yes, that is correct.

754
00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:54.680
- What did you use as a guide?
- Erm, this.

755
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.724
The Art of the Seance.

756
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:03.522
- Can you help me?
- Yes, Madame Arcati, I think I can.

757
00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:05.899
Do you have your membership card?

758
00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:07.901
Membership card? Er...

759
00:58:10.112 --> 00:58:11.530
Yes.

760
00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:14.616
I'll start by terminating
your membership with immediate effect.

761
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.663
This is no place
for fantasists or frauds.

762
00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:20.956
Margot.

763
00:58:21.707 --> 00:58:23.667
Madame Arcati is leaving now.

764
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:35.595
Meet me in Temple Square in an hour.

765
00:58:49.568 --> 00:58:52.487
Chapter four, page nine,
paragraph six.

766
00:58:57.034 --> 00:59:01.455
A banishing spell.
Margot. Thank you.

767
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:05.083
We don't have long.
I need to replace it in the safe

768
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:10.130
- before Mr. Price returns from lunch.
- It's recorded in ancient Druidic text.

769
00:59:10.255 --> 00:59:12.632
I'm a little rusty but I'll do my best.

770
00:59:12.758 --> 00:59:14.760
Wait.

771
00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:26.188
"Take Ceridwen's brew of devil's claw."

772
00:59:26.855 --> 00:59:27.898
Devil's claw.

773
00:59:28.023 --> 00:59:31.193
- "Poisoned root of aconite."
- Yes.

774
00:59:31.985 --> 00:59:34.321
"Elixir of vervain flowers."

775
00:59:34.446 --> 00:59:37.449
Yes, of course.
That's the enchanter's plant.

776
00:59:45.165 --> 00:59:49.628
"The sacrificial offering
is at its strongest with a waning moon."

777
00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:51.046
A waning moon.

778
00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.800
"Sprinkle black salt on a stone altar."

779
00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:56.176
Black salt.

780
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:59.596
"Then lay the freshly torn bladder
of a carnivore..."

781
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.348
The bla... Bladder?

782
01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:05.185
No.

783
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.938
"Freshly torn bladderwort..."

784
01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:12.025
"of the carnivorous
aquatic Utricularia plant family."

785
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.568
Thank heavens.

786
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:16.822
I thought I was going
to have to get my hands dirty.

787
01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.494
Au revoir, Madame Arcati.

788
01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.580
Good luck.

789
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.172
Will you excuse me?

790
01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:39.678
What about Clark Gable? He'd make
a dashing Detective Frank Flowers.

791
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.596
Good actor, terrible breath.

792
01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:44.307
Very tricky for the leading ladies.

793
01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:47.018
- I was thinking Cary Grant.
- Now we're talking.

794
01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.729
I look forward to making
his acquaintance at the premier.

795
01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.816
Well, I'm afraid you're getting ahead
of yourself there, Mrs. Bradman.

796
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.068
Even I can't make a film
without a script.

797
01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.904
It's rather like trying
to perform surgery without a patient.

798
01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.116
The typewriter can be
a cruel and demanding mistress.

799
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.286
Well, let's hope that's the only affair
Charles is having.

800
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:08.915
Yes.

801
01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.042
Hello, Daddy.

802
01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.587
Time for a speech.

803
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:21.386
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

804
01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.891
A-ha! As a writer,

805
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.978
people are always expecting me
to come up with lots of words.

806
01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.273
Well, today,
I'm sure you'll all be relieved to hear

807
01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:36.943
that I'm going to keep things
short and sweet, just like my wife.

808
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:42.908
If I were to create a character
as beautiful, as poised,

809
01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.242
as perfect as Ruth,

810
01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.244
my fans would accuse me

811
01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.039
of straying into fantasy.

812
01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:52.000
Thankfully we are all here
today to celebrate the fact

813
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.752
that Ruth is my reality

814
01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:57.214
and has been for five fabulous years.

815
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:04.638
So, let us be upstanding upstandingly,
and raise our glasses to true love.

816
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.973
- Yeah.
- True love!

817
01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:09.893
- True love.
- True love.

818
01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:12.103
Never dies.

819
01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.098
- Lord Almighty!
- What on earth are you doing?

820
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:51.935
Cooling off. All that dancing
got me hot and sticky.

821
01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:55.855
Everybody's looking!

822
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.817
I didn't know it was going to be
one of those parties.

823
01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.735
You're as wet as an otter's pocket.

824
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.489
- What happened to your dress?
- What happened to yours, Daddy?

825
01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.825
Everybody!

826
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.369
Lovely, darling. I'm not sure the fish
are enjoying this.

827
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:12.289
Why don't you come upstairs
and have a little lie-down?

828
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.165
Only if you're going to join me.

829
01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:22.632
Make love to me
like it was the first time.

830
01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:29.264
Whee! Does Mr. Peasebody
want to come out and play?

831
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.563
Well, I'm not surprised she doesn't like
to do it with the lights on.

832
01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:40.108
- Don't be so vulgar, Elvira.
- She's in here?

833
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.737
Now, you listen to me,
you low-rent hussy.

834
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:50.160
This is my party, my bedroom,
my house and Charles is my husband!

835
01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:52.787
What did she say?

836
01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:56.249
She apologized unreservedly
and has taken herself back downstairs.

837
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.961
You should've been an actor, Charles.
You really are rather good.

838
01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.214
Darling.
I'm sorry, Charles. I'm just...

839
01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.425
I'm not in the mood anymore.

840
01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.138
I am.

841
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.284
Morning, darling.

842
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.287
You look shattered.

843
01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.123
Yes, had a bit of a restless night.

844
01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:40.960
Yes. Yes, I thought
you were thrashing around a bit.

845
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:46.299
I had Edna prepare Norfolk kippers,
your favorite.

846
01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.761
That's very sweet.
I could do with something hearty.

847
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:53.056
I fear I rather overdid it
on the bubbles yesterday.

848
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.519
Party went by in a bit of a blur.

849
01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.897
What are you stuck on?

850
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.650
Twenty-two down,
Greek god of retribution.

851
01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.820
Seven letters, third letter M,
seventh letter S.

852
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.615
Nemesis.

853
01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:40.645
- What on earth has happened?
- She said the place is cursed.

854
01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.108
It's not safe!
It's not safe at all!

855
01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:48.653
Edna? You can't leave us!

856
01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.282
You can keep your job!
No, I'm getting out of here. Go away!

857
01:05:52.407 --> 01:05:54.826
I'm having nothing to do with you.
Go away!

858
01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.372
You can stick your bleedin' job
up your bum!

859
01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.180
There you are.

860
01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.223
There you are.

861
01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:20.185
Now, to work.

862
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.399
Yes.

863
01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:41.039
Where are you?

864
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.334
Detective,
I don't see how you can blame a girl

865
01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:48.755
for falling in love with the right guy
for the wrong reasons.

866
01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:51.466
What about
that poor sap of a husband of yours?

867
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.301
Guys like him are a dime a dozen.
What was he?

868
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.512
The right guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

869
01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.432
Detective,
just being close to you,

870
01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:02.393
I feel as if I am completely naked.

871
01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:05.813
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

872
01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:11.110
I see things just the way they are.

873
01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:13.404
The rest of the world needs bifocals.

874
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.869
I'm not sure about that last line.
It feels too florid.

875
01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:24.207
It needs something simple
and to the point like...

876
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:29.212
That's my job, sweetie. I just do it.

877
01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:34.884
Whatever you prefer.
It's your name on the script.

878
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:42.976
And, "Fade to black."

879
01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:45.186
Ooh!

880
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:48.982
Well, dare I say it? I think the film's
going to be even better than the book.

881
01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:52.485
We've finished ahead of the deadline.

882
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:55.321
Just wait till I tell Ruth.

883
01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.911
Let's not tell her just yet.

884
01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.919
For heaven's sake!

885
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.673
Ooh! Fiddlesticks!

886
01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.095
- Damn and blast!
- Are you all right, darling?

887
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.139
Knowing you work
your fingers to the bone

888
01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:25.018
makes it easier for me
to endure a few blisters and burns.

889
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.815
Out of suffering have emerged
the strongest souls, my dear.

890
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.694
I've nothing to serve for lunch.

891
01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.280
Please don't worry about it.
I'm not in the least hungry.

892
01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:40.491
Dare I ask how it's going over there?

893
01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.788
- The finishing line is almost in sight.
- Thank goodness.

894
01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:48.625
I don't like you alone with her
one iota,

895
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.295
but if it means you're going to be able
to deliver the damned script,

896
01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.380
then I can just about tolerate it.

897
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.467
You and I do make a good team, darling.

898
01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:04.265
I'd like us to move our beds
back together.

899
01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.643
Permanently.

900
01:09:08.436 --> 01:09:11.648
I think if we're going to be separated
during the days,

901
01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:16.277
the least we can do is spend our nights
together as man and wife.

902
01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.864
Yes, I should like nothing more.

903
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.996
I'm going to take a walk,
try to clear my head.

904
01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:40.009
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek along here,

905
01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:43.513
and your reward when you found me?

906
01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:50.520
Look, isn't he handsome?

907
01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:53.815
He's magnificent.

908
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.276
He can sense me.

909
01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:01.531
How wonderful not to be frightened
of the unknown.

910
01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:07.328
You're not frightened, are you, Charles?

911
01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.249
- Of what?
- Falling back in love.

912
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:17.338
How is that possible when we're existing
on two different planes?

913
01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:21.759
- I'm alive and you're...
- Don't... Don't say it.

914
01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.932
I'm so sorry, Elvira.
There's no easy way to say this.

915
01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:35.148
But I'm struggling to see
a future in us.

916
01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:51.748
You know, Charles, when you give someone
an eternity ring,

917
01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.584
it's supposed to be a love
that lasts forever.

918
01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.045
Charles?

919
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.250
Charles, watch out!

920
01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:40.630
Damn!

921
01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:46.552
She's dangerous, Charles.

922
01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:50.223
Edna was almost scalped.
Look what happened to Edith.

923
01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:51.808
What are you suggesting?

924
01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:55.603
It's blindingly obvious
that Elvira came here

925
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.939
for one purpose and one purpose only.

926
01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.691
She came here
to have you to herself forever.

927
01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:03.736
How?

928
01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.989
- By killing you off, of course.
- That's absurd.

929
01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.450
Do you really think the cabinet
climbed up onto the roof

930
01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.035
and jumped off of its own accord?

931
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.331
Elvira may be prone to temper tantrums,
but she still loves me.

932
01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:16.916
She'd never wish me any harm.

933
01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:21.921
If you were dead,
it would be her final triumph over me.

934
01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.841
She'd have you all to herself
on her beastly astral plane

935
01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:26.342
and I'd be left high and dry.

936
01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.262
She's probably planning
some sort of spiritual remarriage.

937
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:36.018
What are we going to do?

938
01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:41.023
Yes, the guest's name is Madame Arcati.
Room 14.

939
01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:44.151
One moment.
I'm sorry but she left yesterday.

940
01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:47.613
- I see. Did she leave any messages?
- I'm afraid not.

941
01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:49.740
Thank you.

942
01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.576
She checked out yesterday.

943
01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:57.832
There's nothing for it.
I shall have to get myself arrested,

944
01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.500
spend the night locked up in the cells.

945
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:03.504
No, we just have to create
our own safe place for the night.

946
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.256
Right.

947
01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:09.385
Now, gently does it.

948
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.852
Precious.

949
01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:24.317
Herba veneris,
nature's divine protector.

950
01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:37.788
What are you doing with that?

951
01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.625
I've just removed all the heavy
and sharp objects for a reason.

952
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.710
I thought you could keep going
with your script

953
01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:46.422
- while we're holed up in here.
- Erm...

954
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.758
I've already finished it.

955
01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.302
I thought you said you were struggling.

956
01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:54.555
On reflection, I think I was
overthinking the whole thing.

957
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.599
I'll give the manuscript a quick read

958
01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.351
and drive it to the studio
in the morning.

959
01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:01.395
Charles. What wonderful news.

960
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.481
Daddy's going to be over the moon.

961
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.483
- As am I.
- Thank you, darling.

962
01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:11.280
Now we can both focus on banishing
Elvira into oblivion once and for all.

963
01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.449
Not a moment too soon.
Two's company.

964
01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.409
Three's a nightmare.

965
01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.915
Nearly there.

966
01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:30.257
Vervain and dill
hinder witches from their will.

967
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.576
Charles.

968
01:14:59.286 --> 01:15:01.789
Charles!

969
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.901
Hello?

970
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.070
Mrs. Condomine, I have news.

971
01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.823
Doors are opening
and change is in the air.

972
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.867
This is no time for riddles.

973
01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:39.910
We've been urgently
trying to contact you.

974
01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:44.957
Charles's life is in grave danger.
Elvira is trying to murder him.

975
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:47.668
I feared she might become
a malevolent spirit.

976
01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:50.296
That's putting it mildly. Where are you?

977
01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:54.133
In Sussex. I've gathered everything
together and now I'm ready.

978
01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.886
- For what?
- Well, to send her back, of course.

979
01:15:57.011 --> 01:16:00.222
Stay put, Madame Arcati.
I'll come and collect you.

980
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:07.354
The telephone woke me.
Apologies if I scared you.

981
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.315
Er, when Mr. Condomine wakes up,

982
01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:11.442
tell him I've gone
to fetch Madame Arcati

983
01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.152
and I shall be back before lunch.

984
01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.444
Don't hurt me, I beg you!

985
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.698
- Are you all right in there?
- I've never stopped loving you.

986
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:03.911
I don't know what to say, sir.

987
01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:07.248
You have a funny way
of showing it, Charles.

988
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.708
I was going to put your name
on the manuscript

989
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.502
before I delivered it, I promise.

990
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.838
That won't be necessary, sir.

991
01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.799
I'm a woman. We're used to not getting
the credit we deserve.

992
01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:19.802
No, I insist. I'll get changed
and leave straight away.

993
01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.346
Mrs. Condomine left in the car
a while ago.

994
01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.348
She said she'd be back by lunchtime.

995
01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.560
Elvira, what have you done?

996
01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.032
Whoops.

997
01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:10.579
Mr. Condomine, I would just like to say
that I reproach myself bitterly.

998
01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:16.460
You are not to blame, Madame Arcati.
The fault lies squarely on my shoulders.

999
01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:22.341
It was my ambition and ego that
dragged us into this unbearable mess.

1000
01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.928
That's something I shall have
to live with for the rest of my life.

1001
01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:31.225
The last time I spoke with
Mrs. Condomine, your life was in danger.

1002
01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:35.187
I urge you to come and see me
at your earliest possible convenience.

1003
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.565
Here is my card. I'll be waiting.

1004
01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.736
You're not going to stay
for refreshments?

1005
01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:45.239
No, please, don't think me rude,
but I...

1006
01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:50.411
I prefer to contemplate the passing
of a spirit in my own private way.

1007
01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:57.293
My sincerest condolences, Mr. Condomine.

1008
01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:05.134
Shouldn't that be "Congratulations"?

1009
01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:10.097
What the hell are you doing here?
Have you no shame?

1010
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.559
It was an accident, Charles.
I was trying to kill you.

1011
01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:18.022
- How can you be so heartless?
- Death does that to you.

1012
01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.567
You know, you can always tell
how well regarded someone is

1013
01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:25.070
- by the attendance at their funeral.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1014
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:27.448
Bit of a poor turnout today,
if you ask me.

1015
01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.533
I barely counted 40 people.

1016
01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:33.662
That does it.

1017
01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:35.914
Come here!

1018
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.916
Just like old times, Charles!

1019
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:41.045
With you chasing me
round the garden.

1020
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:44.840
Today there's going to be
a different outcome.

1021
01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.640
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

1022
01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.943
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Mackintosh.

1023
01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:08.155
Ruth was a fine woman and a good friend.

1024
01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.991
I'm going to miss her deeply.

1025
01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:14.953
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman.
I know she was fond of you too.

1026
01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.248
I can't quite believe she's gone.

1027
01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:24.546
My mother always said that time
is a physician that heals every grief.

1028
01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:38.560
You never were much of an opponent
on the croquet lawn, Charles.

1029
01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.396
You repulse me.

1030
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.817
I'm going to kill you!

1031
01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:50.697
Don't be an imbecile. I'm already dead.

1032
01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:54.410
You better fetch your medicinal bag
before someone else gets killed.

1033
01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:58.539
Edna was right. This place is cursed.

1034
01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:03.335
- I can't bear to see you ever again.
- The feeling's mutual, Charles.

1035
01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.839
With age and disappointment,
you've become a pompous ass.

1036
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.466
Charles! Charles!

1037
01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:14.596
- Everything's going to be splendid.
- Not while she's here, it won't.

1038
01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:16.974
- Not while who's here?
- Elvira!

1039
01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.786
- Where am I?
- In the loony bin.

1040
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.079
What?

1041
01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.384
There's no point in struggling, Charles.

1042
01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.679
The more you thrash around,
the longer they'll keep you in.

1043
01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.972
Why am I here?

1044
01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:59.516
You've been sectioned
under the Mental Treatment Act

1045
01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:02.269
and held under mandatory observation
for the next 28 days.

1046
01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.605
I hope you rot in hell.

1047
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:08.650
It's not wise to be bad-tempered
with the only person who can help you.

1048
01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.487
I'd rather eat my tongue
than ask you for help!

1049
01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:12.988
Ooh. You might get to do that.

1050
01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.824
Dr. McEwan is planning on taking you
down the corridor in 15 minutes

1051
01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.242
for electric-shock treatment.

1052
01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:19.036
What?

1053
01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.414
No! No, come back. Wait.

1054
01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:26.335
There's usually a way around
these things.

1055
01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:28.754
What do you want from me?

1056
01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:33.425
I know you're never
going to forgive me, Charles,

1057
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.429
and being stuck in purgatory with you
grieving over another woman

1058
01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.556
is a fate worse than death.

1059
01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.975
I couldn't agree more.

1060
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.229
Which is why I want a divorce.

1061
01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:47.523
With pleasure.

1062
01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.610
And I know just the person
who can execute that.

1063
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.120
Good.

1064
01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:11.672
Move over. There's no way
I'm putting my life in your hands again.

1065
01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:14.383
Don't flatter yourself.
When I think of what might've happened

1066
01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:17.427
if I'd succeeded in getting you
to the other side, it makes me shudder.

1067
01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:21.014
Nothing but bickering and squabbling
for eternity.

1068
01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.269
Drive.

1069
01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:32.734
Looking back on our married years,

1070
01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.821
I can see now, with horrid clarity,
they were nothing but a mockery.

1071
01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:41.618
You were feckless, irresponsible,
morally unstable.

1072
01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.329
I realized that
before we left Budleigh Salterton.

1073
01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:46.415
Nobody but a monumental bore

1074
01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.126
would've thought of going
to Budleigh Salterton for a honeymoon.

1075
01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.961
What's the matter
with Budleigh Salterton?

1076
01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:53.422
Seven hours a day on a damp golf course

1077
01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:56.383
and a three-piece orchestra
playing Merrie England.

1078
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:58.844
I'm surprised you didn't complain
at the time.

1079
01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.762
I remember you being quite good at that.

1080
01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:03.432
I did complain,
but you wouldn't listen.

1081
01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:09.521
That's why I took a romantic stroll
on the moors with Captain Bracegirdle.

1082
01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.523
What a blind fool I was.

1083
01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:16.028
- Did he make love to you?
- Only very discreetly.

1084
01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:25.621
Mr. Condomine, I'm so relieved
you've arrived safely.

1085
01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:29.958
Follow me. Tonight the moon is full
and we must harness its power.

1086
01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:32.836
We're both ready to perform
the banishment ceremony immediately.

1087
01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.633
- She's here?
- Yes.

1088
01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:40.802
Are you sure she's amenable
to the process?

1089
01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:42.512
Yes.

1090
01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:53.565
With this magic smoke,
I invoke the spirit of moonfire.

1091
01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:58.195
Dancer of time,
mistress of endings and beginnings...

1092
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.906
to return our sacred sister

1093
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:02.908
to her rightful sphere.

1094
01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:07.037
- Still here?
- Yes.

1095
01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:12.000
To you, the spirit of earth.

1096
01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.504
To you, the element of air.

1097
01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.507
To you, the force of water.

1098
01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:21.134
To you, the power of fire

1099
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.680
and the gift of enchanter's dew.

1100
01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:31.728
- She still here?
- Yes.

1101
01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.105
Yes!

1102
01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:37.526
Ghostly specter, ghoul and fiend,

1103
01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:40.404
never more be thou convened.

1104
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:43.240
Wolf's bane and holy rite,

1105
01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.450
banish thee into the night.

1106
01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.082
Bladderwort, bladderwort!
Bladderwort.

1107
01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.585
Yes. Come.

1108
01:26:56.253 --> 01:27:00.841
Yes. And... bladderwort.

1109
01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:07.597
- Ruth!
- Ruth?

1110
01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:10.559
I'm so happy to see you again.

1111
01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.980
Blast! How could I
have been such a duffer?

1112
01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:16.940
Something must have gone
hideously wrong.

1113
01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.567
Yes, not for the first time.

1114
01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:21.278
- You hussy!
- Darling?

1115
01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:24.823
Save yourself the effort.
I'm already dead.

1116
01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.284
And more to the point, so are you.

1117
01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:30.871
- You popped your clogs last Tuesday.
- Don't be so insensitive.

1118
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.165
Darling, are you in any pain?

1119
01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:37.377
Charles, what happened to me?

1120
01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:39.796
There was a car accident.

1121
01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.549
Which, I have to admit,
I had a hand in.

1122
01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:43.800
I'm sorry, Ruth.

1123
01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.927
I'm afraid "sorry" doesn't quite cut it.

1124
01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:50.599
Well, even so. In the spirit of complete
openness, I'd also like to apologize

1125
01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:53.518
for conducting an affair with Charles
right under your nose.

1126
01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:57.606
Technically, we are still married, so...

1127
01:27:57.731 --> 01:27:58.899
Stop it, Elvira.

1128
01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:03.278
- Ruth has been through quite enough.
- What are they saying, Mr. Condomine?

1129
01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.072
Not now, Madame Arcati.
Things are becoming quite strained.

1130
01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:09.993
I should have squeezed malum citrea
at the crucial point.

1131
01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.828
That's lemon juice.

1132
01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:15.081
The only reason
he was able to through that screenplay

1133
01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:17.209
in five days flat is because I wrote it.

1134
01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:20.962
- Yes...
- Charles, is that true?

1135
01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.798
Not exactly.

1136
01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.593
Charles didn't want to tell you
we'd finished

1137
01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:29.179
because he wanted to spend
more time alone with me.

1138
01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:33.016
Charles...

1139
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:37.145
- Let's not fight, darling.
- Which darling are you referring to?

1140
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:40.899
After everything I put up with,
how could you do that to me?

1141
01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:43.902
It's not that straightforward, darlings.

1142
01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:47.739
I mean, really, Charles,
you never loved Elvira or me.

1143
01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:50.742
The only person that you love
is yourself!

1144
01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.410
No...

1145
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.996
Finally, something we do agree on.

1146
01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.125
If you wrote the script,

1147
01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:03.380
- did he write any of those books?
- No, not a word.

1148
01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.882
- He took all the glory?
- Won't you stay for the second act?

1149
01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.467
I think it's best I leave.

1150
01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.178
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

1151
01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:11.555
Try two of them.

1152
01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:14.683
Good luck with the lemons.

1153
01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:17.644
Where did he go?

1154
01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:21.648
- He can run.
- But he can't hide.

1155
01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:40.083
Ghostly specter, ghoul or fiend,

1156
01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.878
never more be thou convened.

1157
01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:47.132
Bladderwort, wolf's bane and holy rite,

1158
01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:50.385
banish thee into the night.

1159
01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.734
Donald?

1160
01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:38.433
All right, I'm gonna start
with this medium shot.

1161
01:30:38.558 --> 01:30:42.354
Then I'm gonna come in a little closer.
Let's have some passion!

1162
01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:44.105
All right, roll the camera.

1163
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.027
- Quiet, please!
- Sound running!

1164
01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:50.528
Scene 84, take one.

1165
01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:53.114
And action.

1166
01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:59.287
Just being close to you, Frank,
I feel as if I'm completely naked.

1167
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:04.668
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

1168
01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:08.546
That's my job, sweetie.
I just do it.

1169
01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.342
Cut!

1170
01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:13.802
Reset.

1171
01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:20.558
I'm not feeling the last line.
Boy Wonder, what else you got?

1172
01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:23.687
Er... Well, er...

1173
01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:31.236
What about,
"I see things just the way they are.

1174
01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:33.905
The rest of the world needs bifocals"?

1175
01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:40.787
I love it. OK, reset. Makeup.

1176
01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.998
I want to move in closer.

1177
01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.500
You're a genius, Charles.

1178
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:49.129
Audiences are going to devour
the whole spiritualist angle.

1179
01:31:49.254 --> 01:31:50.338
Yeah.

1180
01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.427
It's just a shame
Ruth isn't here to enjoy it.

1181
01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:02.892
Mr. Condomine?
Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times.

1182
01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:06.354
Hello.

1183
01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:08.148
How does it feel to be
the talk of the town?

1184
01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:09.482
That's awfully sweet of you,

1185
01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:11.985
but I'm not sure anybody's interested
in the lowly writer.

1186
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:16.990
I have a hunch that
my 35 million readers will be enthralled

1187
01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:20.660
- by the story of a serial plagiarist.
- Plagiarist?

1188
01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:23.121
I know you revel
in gossip and scandal, Miss Hopper,

1189
01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:26.082
but that's a completely outrageous
and unfounded accusation.

1190
01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:30.170
There is nothing unfounded about
the writ Señor Morales is serving.

1191
01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:32.338
Would you care to comment on the fact

1192
01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:35.550
that your 15
Detective Frank Flowers whodunnits

1193
01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:39.512
are based word for word on the Inspector
Francisco Flores crime novels

1194
01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:42.140
which are bestsellers
across all of Mexico?

1195
01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:44.517
Say "Cheese," Mr. Condomine.

1196
01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:47.520
You!

1197
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.107
Don't look so shocked, Charles.

1198
01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:54.444
You and I both know there's
no such thing as an original story.

1199
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.280
- How could you?
- Can't you just be quiet?

1200
01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:02.410
- I'm trying to make a picture here!
- You scheming little witch.

1201
01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:05.330
So much for the famous British charm.

1202
01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:09.125
♪ I'll be loving you always

1203
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:13.463
- ♪ With a love that's true, always
- No. Stop it. No!

1204
01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:17.008
- Stop it! No!
- Your first novel?

1205
01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:19.636
- Greta Garbo speaking my words.
- Stop it!

1206
01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:22.472
You and I both know there's
no such thing as an original story.

1207
01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:23.932
Promise you can't touch her.

1208
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.726
I'm a woman. We're used
to not getting the credit we deserve.

1209
01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:30.188
The only person
that you love is yourself.

1210
01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:33.233
Ooh!

1211
01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.822
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1212
01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:42.075
- You could've killed me!
- I just did.

1213
01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:54.087
Nobody will ever forget you, Charles.

1214
01:33:54.212 --> 01:33:57.549
They'll remember what a fraud you were.
Always.

1215
01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:09.102
Farewell, Mr. Peasebody!

1216
01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:11.855
- You can't just leave me here.
- Whoo!

1217
01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:23.366
Read all about it! Read all about it!

1218
01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:27.370
Murdered British crime writer
revealed to be serial plagiarist!

1219
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:32.375
Poor Charles. How dreadful.

1220
01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:36.296
It's like a plot from one of his novels.

1221
01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:39.340
Or perhaps from someone else's.

1222
01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:50.101
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?

1223
01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:53.396
One knock for yes, two knocks for no.

1224
01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:54.898
Yes, I'm here.

1225
01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:58.151
Whatever happened to leaving someone
to rest in peace?

1226
01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:01.070
Mr. Condomine,
I simply wanted to apologize

1227
01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:04.657
for any part I may have played
in your untimely demise.

1228
01:35:04.782 --> 01:35:07.160
You weren't behind the wheel,
Madame Arcati.

1229
01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:10.747
No, but I fear
I may have put fuel in the tank.

1230
01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.540
Well, c'est la vie.

1231
01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:15.752
I also wanted
to express my gratitude.

1232
01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.213
Without you, I would still be searching.

1233
01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:21.424
Well, at least one of us
is enjoying a happy ending.

1234
01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.135
May I be so bold as to ask

1235
01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:26.638
what it's like on the other side?

1236
01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:28.806
- Charles?
- Charles?

1237
01:35:28.973 --> 01:35:30.183
Complicated!

1238
01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:35.553
