WEBVTT

1
00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.541
Come on, you blithering idiot.

2
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.208
There's only 26 letters
in the damned alphabet.

3
00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:05.231
All you've got to do is put
them in the right bloody order.

4
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.791
Write something.

5
00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:13.833
Anything.

6
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:32.958
Right.

7
00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:34.958
Music.

8
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:49.000
Oh, Charles!

9
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.500
Think!

10
00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:23.375
Charles!

11
00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:25.375
Darling!

12
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.958
Charles, they can hear you in Timbuktu!

13
00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:35.708
Much obliged.

14
00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:43.500
If you insist on living
like a nocturnal animal,

15
00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:46.292
at least be civil enough
to hide your tracks.

16
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.541
- Morning, Edith.
- Good morning, ma'am.

17
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.083
Oh, he's finally gone through with it.

18
00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.583
Oh, yes. Scandalous, isn't it?

19
00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.958
On the contrary. I think giving up
the throne for love is awfully romantic.

20
00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.939
I'll have a grilled grapefruit
and a strong coffee, please.

21
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.166
Mr. Condomine's asked for his eggs
to be brought over to his study again.

22
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.375
Given his mood, I hope they're
being served sunny side up.

23
00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.250
Here we go.

24
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:20.167
Two <i>soft</i>-boiled eggs
for William Shakespeare.

25
00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:23.500
What does Her Majesty want this morning?

26
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:27.042
- She's sticking to the Hollywood diet.
- Hollywood diet!

27
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.042
It'll take a lot more
than an exotic fruit

28
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.916
to turn her into Greta Garbo.

29
00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:36.708
Don't dilly-dally in the garden, Edith.

30
00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.541
He'll only send it
back if the toast is cold.

31
00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.417
I'm not a bad man.

32
00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.500
I mean, yes, I like to flirt a bit.

33
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.042
And the occasional flutter.

34
00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.125
Excuse me, sir. Your breakfast.

35
00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:20.250
Edith.

36
00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:22.459
Yes, sir?

37
00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.375
Would you remind Edna

38
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.583
that the word "toast" is
derived from the Latin <i>"tostare",</i>

39
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.125
meaning to scorch or to roast.

40
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:33.833
Whereas this...

41
00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.042
is a cold, hard piece of bread.

42
00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.334
Apologies, sir.

43
00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:46.541
Do you need anything else?

44
00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:48.500
Divine intervention.

45
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.916
It's wonderfully patriotic, Harold.
You've really excelled yourself.

46
00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:01.791
And I'm certain the judges will agree.

47
00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:20.500
How was it so easy for
you, my Manhattan muse?

48
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.208
Charles, you really should be praying
to Cadmus and not decapitating him.

49
00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:31.459
I'm sorry!

50
00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:35.083
You've been commissioned
to write a 90-page screenplay,

51
00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:36.541
not <i>War and Peace.</i>

52
00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.459
I'm at my wits' end.

53
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:42.167
I don't understand how
it could be so problematic

54
00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:44.459
to adapt a story you've already written.

55
00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:49.292
I'm sorry, Charles. I just don't
know how long I can go on like this

56
00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:54.125
with you stuck in an imaginary
world and me alone in the real one.

57
00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:56.708
I miss you.

58
00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:00.167
I miss us.

59
00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.708
So do I.

60
00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:12.459
Look at that.

61
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.042
I just found it amongst some papers.

62
00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.875
Sweet of you to try
and spare my feelings.

63
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.334
- And a little naive.
- Why?

64
00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.042
Because you imagine I
mind you thinking of Elvira.

65
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.083
Well, don't you?

66
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:32.375
No, I'm not in the
least bit jealous of her.

67
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.791
I just wonder, if I died,

68
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:36.958
whether you'd continue to
look at photographs of me.

69
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.459
Oh, darling.

70
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.833
You're not the dying type.

71
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.541
He's simply incorrigible, Violet.

72
00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:51.625
I found him mooning over
pictures of Elvira yesterday.

73
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.750
Elvira?

74
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:56.334
He's been shirking work
and pining for the ex-wife.

75
00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:01.375
Game, set and match.

76
00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:06.375
There's really nothing
to feel insecure about.

77
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.916
Elvira may have been very
attractive, but the poor woman's gone.

78
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:12.125
As has the spark in our relationship.

79
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.708
Charles is a man.

80
00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.958
You can't expect him to juggle
more than one thing at a time.

81
00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.750
My advice, leave him
to worry about the words,

82
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.250
and find someone else
to shake your sheets.

83
00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:25.459
Oh, come on. Don't be a prude.

84
00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:28.666
One must be practical for a
marriage to run the course.

85
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:32.125
Do you remember what you learnt
in our last lesson, Mrs. Bradman?

86
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.000
Strong, firm grip. How could I forget?

87
00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:47.375
So, what seems to be
the trouble, old chap?

88
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.292
Things don't seem to be
flowing as they used to.

89
00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:53.916
Name me a wordsmith
who hasn't wrestled

90
00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.540
with a bout of writer's
block once in a while, hey?

91
00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:01.417
The truth is, it's not just
the words that have dried up.

92
00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:06.583
Big Ben's stopped chiming.

93
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.417
Mr. Peasebody's got stage fright.

94
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:14.459
Oh, you poor fellow.

95
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.875
It's like playing billiards with a rope.

96
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.334
Try a couple of these. Should
put some fuel back in your tank.

97
00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.375
- What are they?
- Benzedrine sulphate.

98
00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:31.791
Amphetamine. Enhances cheerfulness.

99
00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:33.541
Alertness.

100
00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:37.000
And as Violet will testify, it
does wonders for your libido.

101
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:40.083
Sounds too good to be
true. Is it habit-forming?

102
00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.708
Not at all. Been using them for years.

103
00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:55.541
Slow down! Charles,
you'll give us both a coronary!

104
00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:58.417
I've never felt more alive!

105
00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:00.375
Why? What's happened?

106
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.208
I decided to take your advice
and look on the positives.

107
00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:06.334
Surely it's better to be up than down?

108
00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:08.459
I don't want you to exhaust yourself

109
00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:11.666
before the medium show
at the theatre tonight.

110
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:14.958
Nobody in their right mind would
waste a perfectly pleasant evening

111
00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:19.000
pretending to be fascinated by
someone holding a one-way conversation.

112
00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:26.958
Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats.

113
00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:30.417
This evening's performance
will commence in two minutes.

114
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:34.292
Isn't that your cook? And your maid.

115
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:40.334
Oh, yes, so it is. Poor Edith. She's
been very taken with this sort of thing

116
00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:43.625
since she lost her brother,
fighting the Fascists in Spain.

117
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.833
Primitive superstition
can be very persuasive,

118
00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.208
especially with the
emotionally susceptible.

119
00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:09.042
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to an evening

120
00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:13.541
that will change your
perceptions of the world we inhabit.

121
00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:19.250
That will answer irrefutably

122
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.208
the question that has confounded
mankind since the dawn of time.

123
00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:32.625
Is there life after death?

124
00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:35.625
No.

125
00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:43.708
There she is.

126
00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:55.334
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>

127
00:10:56.666 --> 00:10:58.334
<i>bonsoir.</i>

128
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:05.042
From the Great Pyramid
of Cholula in the west

129
00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.625
to Mount Taishan in the east.

130
00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:14.208
From Whanganui-a-Tara in
the south to Uppsala in the north,

131
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.250
I have traveled the globe,

132
00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:22.500
communing with gurus, swamis and shamans.

133
00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:29.500
These wise sages have guided
me to a deeper dimension,

134
00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:34.459
where finally I experienced an epiphany

135
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:40.208
and broke through to the other side.

136
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.916
I am certain that everyone here

137
00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:57.625
has sensed the spirits of
their departed loved ones,

138
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.958
and I am certain we all wish we
could communicate with them again,

139
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:07.625
to say the things we never got to say.

140
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.417
I've got it!

141
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.292
- Tonight...
- Sorry.

142
00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:15.500
...I will use a precious mystical gift

143
00:12:16.666 --> 00:12:19.334
to make that possible.

144
00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:21.916
Bugger!

145
00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.916
Madame Arcati.

146
00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:36.125
- It's a conjuring trick.
- How dare you?

147
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.500
Here, I told you, she's a fraud.

148
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:40.958
That's an outrageous accusation!

149
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.583
I merely lost contact.

150
00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:46.042
Charles was right. It
was all a put-up job.

151
00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.042
Where'd he go?

152
00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:50.125
Please, please.

153
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:56.625
Madame Arcati has just been
through a very traumatic experience.

154
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:57.791
Please just...

155
00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:03.666
Please, I would ask you to respect
her privacy at this difficult time!

156
00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:06.167
Oh, my giddy aunt!

157
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.541
I've told you, Mandeep, I
don't want to see a living soul.

158
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.000
My name is Charles Condomine.
I'm an award-winning writer.

159
00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:21.833
And especially not the gutter press.

160
00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.666
No, I'm not a reporter. I write
crime novels and screenplays.

161
00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:28.500
Well, I can't abide fiction or fantasy.

162
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.125
Get out!

163
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.791
Madame Arcati?

164
00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:37.916
I'm not here to question your integrity.

165
00:13:38.042 --> 00:13:41.334
Faking an exotic accent
doesn't mean your gift isn't real.

166
00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:43.958
I fully understand that, like me,

167
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:47.833
you occasionally have to
employ a certain artistic license

168
00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.459
to entertain the masses.

169
00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:52.833
They expect me to deliver a spectacle,

170
00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.708
a transcendental
miracle night after night.

171
00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:59.708
Of course. There's no
need to justify yourself.

172
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.625
I'm a believer.

173
00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:07.833
I'm simply here to invite you to
conduct a private seance at my home.

174
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:12.459
Well, I'm not a traveling banjo player,
Mr. Condomine. I don't do requests.

175
00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:16.666
Well, there might be some
influential guests attending.

176
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:21.125
Could be the perfect opportunity
to fend off any bad publicity

177
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.666
from tonight's unfortunate events.

178
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.167
When were you wishing this to take place?

179
00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:31.292
Well, as soon as possible.

180
00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:36.958
Then I suggest this
Thursday, Midsummer Night.

181
00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:38.375
The solstice.

182
00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:43.208
The sacred turning point of the seasons.

183
00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:48.208
Perfect.

184
00:14:48.334 --> 00:14:51.749
I told her how profoundly interested I
was in anything to do with the occult

185
00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:53.375
and she blossomed like a rose.

186
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.582
Hosting an evening with
a professional charlatan

187
00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:57.250
- sounds like a scream.
- Doesn't it?

188
00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:00.375
But will it get you closer to
finishing your screenplay?

189
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.749
I need the old girl to
show me tricks of the trade.

190
00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:04.707
That's what'll make my new hero unique.

191
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:06.666
What'<i>s so</i> unique about him?

192
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:07.875
- He's dead.
- Dead?

193
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.375
As a doornail. He's the victim
of a vicious unsolved murder

194
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.666
and communicates with
the living through a medium

195
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.999
who helps bring people
back from beyond the grave.

196
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.582
Maybe she could resurrect
your career at the same time.

197
00:15:18.666 --> 00:15:19.875
Daddy's on the warpath.

198
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.197
He's threatened to find another
writer if you don't deliver soon.

199
00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:50.958
Is anybody there?

200
00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.791
Is anybody there?

201
00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:01.334
One rap for yes, two raps for no.

202
00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.167
- Is that you, Maia?
- <i>Who's</i> Maia?

203
00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:11.208
My spirit guide.

204
00:16:11.334 --> 00:16:13.833
She was Tutankhamun's wet-nurse.

205
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:18.083
I do hope she's not still lactating.

206
00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:20.666
I would ask you not to
be flippant, Dr. Bradman.

207
00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:25.541
She may be in Shambhala,
but the woman still has feelings.

208
00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:30.250
Please forgive me, Madame
Arcati. I didn't mean to cause of fence.

209
00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:56.583
Now we're getting somewhere.

210
00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:02.583
Is it me you wish to speak to?

211
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:08.750
Is it Dr. Bradman? Or perhaps
one of his less-fortunate patients?

212
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:14.167
Mrs. Bradman?

213
00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:19.375
Mrs. Condomine?

214
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.292
Oh, behave yourself, Maia.

215
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.417
Mr. Condomine?

216
00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:32.230
It appears there's someone who
wishes to speak to you, Mr. Condomine.

217
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:36.625
Do you know anyone who has
recently passed over to the other side?

218
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.749
Only my old literary agent, but
it's unlikely he'd make contact.

219
00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:42.541
He owed me a fortune in royalties.

220
00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:47.083
Are you Mr. Condomine's literary agent?

221
00:17:50.666 --> 00:17:53.791
No. I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

222
00:17:56.292 --> 00:17:59.625
Is there anyone on the
other side you think of often?

223
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.583
No. Well, there's nothing for it.
I shall have to go into a trance.

224
00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:14.375
This is the moment I hate.

225
00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:17.334
Are you nervous or...?

226
00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:19.541
When I was a child, I used to be sick.

227
00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:23.541
Let's see. What have we here?

228
00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.791
Oh, Brahms. No, that's
too dark and depressing.

229
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.833
Rachmaninov? No, too florid.

230
00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:35.875
Oh, no, this is better. <i>Always.</i>

231
00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:38.124
Does it have to be that song?

232
00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:41.000
Well, Maia likes a tune
she can hum along to.

233
00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.541
<i>Always</i>

234
00:19:02.916 --> 00:19:06.117
<i>I'll be loving you always</i>

235
00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:11.334
<i>With a love that's true Always</i>

236
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:14.541
<i>When the things you've planned</i>

237
00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:19.208
<i>Need a helping hand I will understand</i>

238
00:19:19.334 --> 00:19:20.944
<i>Always...</i>

239
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.000
No!

240
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.042
Crikey!

241
00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:38.833
- What the devil's going on?
- Must be a power cut.

242
00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:46.083
Madame Arcati? Madame
Arcati, can you hear me?

243
00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:49.208
- Is she breathing?
- She's having some sort of fit.

244
00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:51.958
Please do something, Dr. Bradman.

245
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.833
- Thank goodness.
- What happened?

246
00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.666
Apart from French windows
blowing open, nothing supernatural.

247
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.083
Well, <i>something</i> substantial took place.

248
00:20:06.208 --> 00:20:09.958
- I can feel it in my base chakra.
- Probably trapped wind.

249
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:14.791
No poltergeists at any rate.

250
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.125
Any apparitions?

251
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.000
Not that we saw.

252
00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:21.972
- What about ectoplasm?
- I'm not quite sure what that is.

253
00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:24.417
A supernatural viscous substance

254
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:28.000
that exudes from the body
of one in a spiritualistic trance

255
00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:32.292
and forms the material for
the manifestation of spirits.

256
00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:35.167
No, I definitely would
have remembered that.

257
00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:39.666
I suppose should get going
before the storm rolls in.

258
00:20:39.791 --> 00:20:42.582
Would you care for refreshments
before you return to your hotel?

259
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:46.042
No, thank you, Mrs.
Condomine. I like to travel light.

260
00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:49.459
Congratulations, Madame
Arcati. It was a thrilling evening.

261
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.708
I'm well aware of the irony
in your voice, Dr. Bradman.

262
00:20:53.292 --> 00:20:55.042
May I be so bold as to remind you

263
00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:57.459
that modern medicine
is a recent phenomena

264
00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.042
and that physicians have found value
in scientifically inexplicable practices

265
00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:05.375
since the beginning of civilization.

266
00:21:05.916 --> 00:21:07.334
Quite so.

267
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.417
Well, good night, everyone.

268
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:16.083
I'm sorry so little eventuated. Probably
something to do with the cosmic flux.

269
00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:19.791
Thank you so much for agreeing
to do this, Madame Arcati.

270
00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:22.334
It's been an education on so many levels.

271
00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:24.958
<i>Merci, Monsieur Condomine.</i>

272
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.167
<i>Et au revoir.</i>

273
00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:38.833
She might hear us.

274
00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:40.666
I can't. Really, I can't.

275
00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:51.507
I can't quite put my
finger on it, Donald.

276
00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:55.625
I've never experienced
anything like it in my life.

277
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.000
It genuinely felt as if...

278
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:03.083
something tremendous had happened.

279
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.625
Oh, well.

280
00:22:10.875 --> 00:22:12.334
Maybe next time.

281
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.875
Good night, my love.

282
00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:36.208
Did you get everything you
need for your screenplay?

283
00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:39.625
Oh, everything and more.

284
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.500
Not thinking of turning in for the night?

285
00:22:43.208 --> 00:22:44.250
What?

286
00:22:45.417 --> 00:22:49.708
Wouldn't it be prudent to get down
the ideas whilst they're still fresh?

287
00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:54.375
Yes, no. Absolutely.

288
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.000
I shall, fix myself
a drink and dig in.

289
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:01.208
<i>Carpe diem,</i> darling.

290
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.625
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

291
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.417
Jesus Christ!

292
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.000
Charles.

293
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.708
What on earth have you done?

294
00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.375
The room looks like a giant peach melba!

295
00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:05.042
And where's my Italian chandelier gone?

296
00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.000
What?

297
00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:22.583
Oh, God!

298
00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:26.475
Hello?

299
00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:34.208
Please tell me you haven't
ruined the rest of the house.

300
00:24:34.334 --> 00:24:35.250
No.

301
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:39.000
My Moroccan mosaics!

302
00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:40.375
Charles!

303
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.208
One weekend away

304
00:24:42.334 --> 00:24:45.583
and the whole place has had
the life and soul sucked out of it.

305
00:24:45.708 --> 00:24:48.292
This can't be happening.
I must be hallucinating.

306
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:50.083
Well, judging from the decor,

307
00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:53.125
I would say that's the
understatement of the century.

308
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:01.791
I should've known
this wasn't down to you.

309
00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:05.500
<i>Who is</i> she?

310
00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:08.459
It's not what you think.

311
00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:13.125
Please, do not humiliate
either one of us any further.

312
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.958
If you've got something to
tell me, be a man and spit it out!

313
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:19.916
Elvira...

314
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:24.125
- You're dead.
- How dare you?

315
00:25:40.334 --> 00:25:45.583
The last thing I remember is competing
in the South Downs Point-to-Point.

316
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:49.042
That's right, and the
conditions were treacherous.

317
00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:52.042
As with most things, you
refused to listen to reason.

318
00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:55.250
Well, I couldn't miss the most
prestigious meet of the season.

319
00:25:55.375 --> 00:25:57.166
You paid the ultimate
price for your folly

320
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.167
and fell at the final fence,
instantly breaking your neck.

321
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.375
The whole episode was very
distressing for everyone involved.

322
00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:07.916
Well, presumably not as
distressing as it was for me.

323
00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:10.124
They did rename the jump in your honor.

324
00:26:12.208 --> 00:26:13.541
How thoughtful.

325
00:26:16.292 --> 00:26:20.167
Well, I don't understand. If I'm
dead, then how and why am I here?

326
00:26:20.292 --> 00:26:22.583
I have absolutely no idea.

327
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.875
- Maybe you're a ghost.
- What?

328
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.958
No!

329
00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.958
- Please, don't get hysterical.
- Hysterical?

330
00:26:33.916 --> 00:26:35.583
Concerned, more like.

331
00:26:35.708 --> 00:26:39.666
Procrastination is the thief of time,
Charles, and yours is running out.

332
00:26:39.791 --> 00:26:41.958
- Who's she?
- My wife, Ruth.

333
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:43.541
Yes? Are you all right?

334
00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:45.625
- I'm your wife.
- Not anymore.

335
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.042
Why? What's the matter?

336
00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:49.958
I'm not speaking to
you. I'm talking to Elvira.

337
00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:51.083
Elvira?

338
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:53.541
Surely you can see her.
She's standing right next to you.

339
00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:55.833
What are you playing at? Elvira's dead.

340
00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:58.459
Why does everyone
have to keep saying that?

341
00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:01.708
Elvira, darling, this is Ruth.
Ruth, darling, this is Elvira.

342
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.042
Are you drunk?

343
00:27:03.167 --> 00:27:05.750
Ruth, Elvira is here with us in the room.

344
00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:08.791
Madame Arcati must have
summoned her up during the seance.

345
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:11.708
Madame Arcati's a
fraud. You said so yourself.

346
00:27:13.334 --> 00:27:16.334
I'm going to bed and I
suggest that you retire too.

347
00:27:17.167 --> 00:27:20.114
Finally, some time to ourselves,
so we can get reacquainted.

348
00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:22.208
That's a thoroughly immoral suggestion.

349
00:27:22.334 --> 00:27:26.334
Oh, I wasn't for a moment
insinuating we share a bed.

350
00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:28.042
- No...
- I've come to terms

351
00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:31.459
with your recent inability to
perform in that department.

352
00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:36.000
I can't imagine you
ever did with that <i>sourpuss.</i>

353
00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:38.375
Be quiet! You're
behaving like a guttersnipe!

354
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.791
It is your behavior, Charles,
that is unpardonable! Good night.

355
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:44.916
Hooray.

356
00:27:45.042 --> 00:27:49.375
What a frightful woman. I can only
assume it was a marriage of convenience.

357
00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:57.334
I've gone mad. That's
what it is. Stark raving mad.

358
00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:07.000
It'll ruin your life if you
allow it to get hold of you.

359
00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:10.583
Once and for all, Ruth, last night
had nothing to do with alcohol.

360
00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:14.958
I wasn't in the least drunk. Something
very peculiar happened to me.

361
00:28:15.083 --> 00:28:18.541
A one-off psychic delusion,
likely brought on by work pressure.

362
00:28:18.666 --> 00:28:22.000
A deadline doesn't explain why,
when I suggested you return to bed,

363
00:28:22.125 --> 00:28:24.958
you said with a disgusting leer
that it was an immoral suggestion.

364
00:28:25.042 --> 00:28:26.958
I thought I was talking to Elvira.

365
00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:30.541
If you were, it conjures up a
fragrant picture of your first marriage.

366
00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:32.875
My first marriage was perfectly charming.

367
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.250
It's in the worst taste
for you to sneer at it.

368
00:28:35.334 --> 00:28:39.000
I'm not nearly so interested in
your first marriage as you think I am.

369
00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:41.874
It's your second marriage that's
absorbing me at the moment.

370
00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:43.334
It's headed for the rocks!

371
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.167
Well, it's 155 over 99. It is quite high.

372
00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:55.541
I'm not surprised, given the
intensity of the hallucination.

373
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.958
I genuinely believed Elvira
was in the room, talking to me.

374
00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.583
She was as real as you or I.

375
00:29:03.625 --> 00:29:06.208
Probably best you stop
taking the tablets, old chap.

376
00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:11.125
Darling.

377
00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:15.666
I hate to see you so upset.

378
00:29:16.208 --> 00:29:18.208
Please accept my heartfelt apology

379
00:29:18.334 --> 00:29:22.208
for anything untoward I might
have said last night... or this morning.

380
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.833
Apology accepted. Let's
never mention it again.

381
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.708
How are you feeling?

382
00:29:29.875 --> 00:29:33.417
Yeah, I believe Dr. Bradman
might have solved the riddle.

383
00:29:33.916 --> 00:29:35.875
Well, thank goodness.

384
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.708
Now, let's go and see your father.

385
00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:42.083
I want to check he likes my new
idea before committing it to the page.

386
00:29:42.167 --> 00:29:43.708
I do not want to be late.

387
00:29:56.583 --> 00:29:57.708
Charles?

388
00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:04.833
So, you see, Henry, it's
only through the medium

389
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:06.666
that the killer can be brought to justice

390
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.291
based on new evidence that he
gathers from beyond the grave.

391
00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:13.875
I like the premise, but not enough to
wait another six months to see a script.

392
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.750
Charles will deliver in a few
weeks, Daddy. You have my word.

393
00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:20.666
And mine.

394
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:22.083
Cut!

395
00:30:22.208 --> 00:30:24.625
Right, come on. Let's
watch the next scene.

396
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.875
I think Hitch will be the
perfect director for our film.

397
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.750
Just don't get under his feet.

398
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:31.916
Come on, darling.

399
00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.167
Googie, how lovely to see you.

400
00:30:37.292 --> 00:30:40.250
- Charles Condomine.
- I'm a big fan of your books.

401
00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:43.833
When can we expect Detective
Flowers to crack his next case?

402
00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:48.250
Charles has actually made the leap
into screenwriting with Daddy's help.

403
00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:52.833
Oh, how exciting! I'd die to play one
of your strong-willed female characters.

404
00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:55.334
Where do you draw your inspiration from?

405
00:30:55.459 --> 00:31:00.292
- Where do you think?
- Oh, how romantic, to marry your muse.

406
00:31:00.417 --> 00:31:02.833
Not so romantic to replace her.

407
00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:05.541
Why don't you tell her the truth?

408
00:31:05.666 --> 00:31:09.708
- That you're an astral bigamist.
- Be quiet. Stop behaving like a harlot.

409
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.375
I beg your pardon?

410
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.750
Admit it, Charles. All of your
female characters are based on me.

411
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.250
You always were vain and self-obsessed.

412
00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:21.916
How dare you speak to
my leading lady like that?

413
00:31:22.042 --> 00:31:24.500
No, no, no, no.

414
00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:31.167
Get a grip, Charles.
What on earth is going on?

415
00:31:31.292 --> 00:31:32.958
Elvira is here.

416
00:31:34.334 --> 00:31:37.250
I can see her. She's right there.

417
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.791
I insist you go home
immediately and lie down.

418
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:43.541
I have no desire to go
to bed in the afternoon.

419
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:45.250
My, how things have changed.

420
00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:49.958
I remember a time when we could barely
drag ourselves out of our double divan.

421
00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:52.666
Stop being indecent. Get out of my sight.

422
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:55.666
How dare you speak
to my daughter like that?

423
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:58.208
- I wasn't speaking to her.
- Get off my set.

424
00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:01.250
- You're in trouble.
- Don't be so infantile.

425
00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:03.916
I'll give you infantile!-

426
00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:12.167
Does it hurt?

427
00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:16.167
- Only if I breathe.
- Let me see it, darling.

428
00:32:17.208 --> 00:32:20.208
- What about now?
- Oh, God!

429
00:32:21.042 --> 00:32:23.125
I suggest you take
yourself to your study.

430
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.916
The only way my father will forgive you

431
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.999
is if you deliver an Oscar-worthy script.

432
00:32:27.083 --> 00:32:28.670
How am I supposed to write in this state?

433
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:32.708
You'd better try. Either start typing
and prove you're not barking mad,

434
00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:34.791
or I'll be forced to call Dr. Bradman

435
00:32:34.916 --> 00:32:37.583
and have you referred
to a nerve specialist.

436
00:32:37.708 --> 00:32:40.958
Ruth, I'm not in the least
neurotic and never have been.

437
00:32:41.083 --> 00:32:43.750
Well, a psychoanalyst, then.

438
00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:46.833
I refuse to endure months
of expensive humiliation,

439
00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:50.624
only to be told that at the age of four,
I was in love with my rocking horse.

440
00:32:50.708 --> 00:32:52.500
Don't take that flippant tone with me.

441
00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:56.292
- I'm not the one who's seeing things.
- You do believe me then.

442
00:32:56.417 --> 00:32:59.583
Of course I don't. There's no
such thing as ghosts or ghouls.

443
00:33:15.292 --> 00:33:17.791
I call upon Donald Keeling,

444
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:25.951
second lieutenant in the 92nd
Regiment of Gordon Highlanders,

445
00:33:27.417 --> 00:33:32.958
who died on February 27th, 1881,

446
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:36.208
at the Battle of Majuba Hill.

447
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:42.625
Come forth and make
yourself known to me...

448
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:49.459
Cecily, your ever-devoted wife.

449
00:33:56.833 --> 00:33:57.958
Donald!

450
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:00.208
Is that you?

451
00:34:01.042 --> 00:34:04.167
It's housekeeping. Do
you need fresh towels?

452
00:34:23.125 --> 00:34:25.125
What are you doing here?

453
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.500
Despite removing every trace
of me, this is still my home.

454
00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:33.541
Besides, I have no idea how
to get back, even if I wanted to.

455
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.832
Are you saying you're
staying indefinitely?

456
00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:39.375
Why? Would you hate it so much if I did?

457
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.042
Honestly, Charles, I
really am a little hurt.

458
00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.333
You're the only one who
could have called me back.

459
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:48.583
I most emphatically did
not send for you, Elvira.

460
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.624
Ruth and I are about to celebrate
our fifth wedding anniversary together.

461
00:35:00.708 --> 00:35:03.625
Five? What is that, leather?

462
00:35:04.666 --> 00:35:07.500
- Wood.
- Watch out for the splinters.

463
00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.375
Mrs. Condomine!

464
00:35:25.583 --> 00:35:29.292
I'll call Dr. Bradman, see if he'll
accompany us to the sanatorium.

465
00:35:29.417 --> 00:35:32.042
Ruth, please listen to
me. I haven't gone mad.

466
00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:35.791
The ghost of my first wife. Elvira,
has crossed over from the other side

467
00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:38.750
- and is in the room with us right now.
- Yes, dear.

468
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:41.042
I know, I see her perfectly well,

469
00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:45.125
along with the zebras and
chimpanzees hiding under the piano.

470
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.250
Ruth, I have always looked upon you

471
00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:50.208
as a woman of perception
and understanding.

472
00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:52.541
I am, but if you say you're not drinking,

473
00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:55.500
there must be something
pressing on your brain.

474
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:58.772
Elvira, do something to reveal
that you really are here. Please!

475
00:35:58.875 --> 00:36:00.625
She's going to have me committed.

476
00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:05.625
Do you remember when we
first heard our song, Charles?

477
00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:10.500
<i>I'll be loving you Always,</i>

478
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:28.833
See? What did I tell you?

479
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:34.083
It's a cruel trick, using some sort of
autosuggestion or hypnotism to scare me.

480
00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:36.916
It isn't. I swear it isn't. Darling!

481
00:36:39.417 --> 00:36:42.541
Darling! Elvira, do something
else, for God's sake.

482
00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:44.334
Oh, anything to oblige.

483
00:36:47.292 --> 00:36:52.000
Look.

484
00:36:54.708 --> 00:36:55.833
What?

485
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.167
<i>Adios,</i> interloper.

486
00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:16.334
I'm afraid we need the room back.

487
00:37:16.459 --> 00:37:20.208
I've told you, I'll be packed
and ready to go within an hour.

488
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.583
Thank God I caught you.

489
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:41.208
You are my only hope.
Something terrible has taken place.

490
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:43.731
You heard strange noises in the night?

491
00:37:44.334 --> 00:37:48.500
Boards creaking, doors slamming?
A subdued moaning in the passages?

492
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.334
No, none of those.

493
00:37:51.459 --> 00:37:54.375
But it appears that after the seance,

494
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.292
my husband's first wife, Elvira,
who died seven years ago,

495
00:37:59.417 --> 00:38:00.708
is back among us.

496
00:38:00.833 --> 00:38:02.292
At last!

497
00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:06.167
A genuine materialization.

498
00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:10.666
I knew something stupendous
had happened to me that night.

499
00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:13.167
I felt it in my spinal cortex.

500
00:38:13.292 --> 00:38:17.334
Oh, after all these years
of... of spiritual devotion,

501
00:38:17.459 --> 00:38:20.208
I've finally been rewarded.

502
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:23.916
I appreciate the pride
in your achievement,

503
00:38:24.042 --> 00:38:25.375
but I would like to point out,

504
00:38:25.459 --> 00:38:27.500
it's making my position
in my home untenable,

505
00:38:27.583 --> 00:38:29.750
and I hold you entirely responsible.

506
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.250
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Condomine.

507
00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:35.375
I'm being abominably selfish.

508
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.583
Just to let me get this clear in my mind,

509
00:38:38.583 --> 00:38:41.875
you yourself have not
seen this manifestation?

510
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.666
No, but Charles claims
he can see and talk to her.

511
00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:51.750
Well, if the emotional connection is
strong, that is sometimes possible.

512
00:38:52.334 --> 00:38:53.375
What?

513
00:38:53.958 --> 00:38:59.791
It can sometimes
develop into a level ten,

514
00:39:00.459 --> 00:39:03.292
something I've never even dared dream of.

515
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.500
Can he, by any chance, touch her?

516
00:39:11.417 --> 00:39:13.708
I sincerely hope not.

517
00:39:15.583 --> 00:39:17.958
Why? Can that happen?

518
00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:21.625
Well, if the returning
spirit feels welcome,

519
00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:25.666
it can gradually

520
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:30.459
become physically substantial.

521
00:39:31.334 --> 00:39:33.042
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman.

522
00:39:33.167 --> 00:39:35.666
Please do let me know
if you hear from her.

523
00:39:40.042 --> 00:39:41.417
She's not there either.

524
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.958
I remember when you couldn't wait
to spend an afternoon alone with me.

525
00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:50.292
Please refrain from playing with
my affections. I feel strange enough.

526
00:39:50.417 --> 00:39:54.375
- So, you do still find me attractive?
- Elvira, please.

527
00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:56.541
This is inappropriate.

528
00:39:57.666 --> 00:39:58.833
Look into my eyes...

529
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.250
and tell me you don't love me anymore.

530
00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:08.541
I shall always love the memory of you.

531
00:40:09.292 --> 00:40:11.708
Memories are about the past, Charles,

532
00:40:11.833 --> 00:40:15.833
but I'm here, and this is the present.

533
00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:21.000
Why don't we take the boat out
like we used to and get some air?

534
00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:25.958
I can't, I'm on a deadline.

535
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:28.625
What are you writing, checks?

536
00:40:29.334 --> 00:40:30.375
I'll have you know,

537
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.546
I've been commissioned to
adapt my first novel for the screen.

538
00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:35.625
Your first novel?

539
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.646
Nearly wore my fingers to the bone
committing this story to the page.

540
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.292
Let's face it, darling,

541
00:40:42.417 --> 00:40:46.459
it's not a coincidence that you haven't
published a word since my demise.

542
00:40:47.334 --> 00:40:49.916
I won't deny you did
have a flair for plot.

543
00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:51.958
And character.

544
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:53.958
And?

545
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:56.459
- And dialogue.
- Right.

546
00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:04.582
The biggest problem you have
is the twist into the third act.

547
00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:08.375
It isn't dramatic enough, which is
why you don't have a satisfying climax.

548
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.041
Tell me something I don't know.

549
00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:12.500
Wouldn't it be smarter to
flip the whole thing on its head

550
00:41:12.583 --> 00:41:14.432
and reveal the husband as the killer?

551
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.375
Oh, that's good.

552
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.666
Or what would be more interesting
is if it's the wife who set him up.

553
00:41:22.083 --> 00:41:24.208
<i>Why</i> would the wife send
her husband to the gallows?

554
00:41:24.292 --> 00:41:27.625
It's obvious, darling. Susan
Rutherford becomes the prime suspect

555
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.916
when her alibi fails to materialize.

556
00:41:30.042 --> 00:41:32.166
We naturally assume
that she's trying to protect

557
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.041
the reputation of the foreign secretary

558
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.666
whose aspirations of
becoming the prime minister

559
00:41:36.791 --> 00:41:41.000
would be severely compromised if it
was revealed that he was having an affair.

560
00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:44.292
But, in reality, nothing
could be further from the truth,

561
00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:46.458
which is what we learn
from the victim himself.

562
00:41:46.541 --> 00:41:49.439
And it's only through the
medium that they can work it out.

563
00:41:50.666 --> 00:41:51.708
Work what out?

564
00:41:51.833 --> 00:41:54.780
That she's pregnant with the
dead foreign secretary's child.

565
00:41:56.083 --> 00:41:58.500
Oh, that's good.

566
00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:01.958
Even I didn't see that one coming.

567
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:06.334
Of course you didn't,
darling. You're just the writer.

568
00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:09.833
I'm afraid, Mrs. Condomine,

569
00:42:09.958 --> 00:42:12.958
that the time has come
for me to admit quite frankly

570
00:42:13.083 --> 00:42:16.125
I haven't the foggiest
idea how to send her back.

571
00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:19.083
I have my own personal reasons

572
00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:22.083
for wishing to communicate
with the departed,

573
00:42:22.208 --> 00:42:23.750
but I never for a moment

574
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:26.624
considered the possibility of
having to send someone back.

575
00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:29.083
Well, I suggest that you find a way.

576
00:42:30.042 --> 00:42:32.708
I refuse to share my husband with anyone,

577
00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:35.292
especially his dead ex-wife.

578
00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:37.042
If I had thought for a moment

579
00:42:37.167 --> 00:42:41.541
that your husband wished to get in
touch with the spirit of his dead ex-wife,

580
00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:43.958
I would have of course
consulted you first.

581
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:45.625
After all, noblesse oblige.

582
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.624
He had no intention of getting in
touch with her, I can assure you.

583
00:42:48.708 --> 00:42:53.167
The whole thing was planned in order for
him to get material for his new project.

584
00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:56.750
Am I to understand I was
invited in a spirit of mockery?

585
00:42:56.875 --> 00:43:00.125
He merely wanted to make some
notes of the tricks of the trade.

586
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.833
Tricks of the trade? I've never
been so insulted in my life.

587
00:43:03.958 --> 00:43:05.875
I'm sorry if that all came out wrong.

588
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.198
I'm rather overwrought
with the whole affair.

589
00:43:08.916 --> 00:43:12.708
Please, I implore you to help us.

590
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.042
I will go to the Spiritual Alliance
on my way back to Sussex

591
00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:19.833
and ask them for guidance.

592
00:43:19.958 --> 00:43:24.375
Sussex? You can't abandon
us in our hour of need.

593
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.625
Well, due to my recent circumstances,
I can no longer afford to stay here,

594
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.334
but you can contact me.

595
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:34.583
I can cover your hotel
bill and any expenses

596
00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:37.208
till this terrifying ordeal
has been resolved.

597
00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:47.125
"Susan Rutherford leans
over the foreign secretary."

598
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.167
Don't stop.

599
00:43:49.292 --> 00:43:54.042
"'The Soviet Union can wait,
' says the foreign secretary."

600
00:43:54.167 --> 00:43:57.666
He turns and looks at Susan longingly.

601
00:43:58.459 --> 00:44:01.083
'This can't..."'-

602
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:02.833
"... he whispers urgently.

603
00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.292
And then..."

604
00:44:06.417 --> 00:44:08.375
"...he starts to slowly..."

605
00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:13.083
Unbutton her silk blouse,

606
00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:18.583
"as they start to passionately kiss."

607
00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:24.083
OK, that takes us
up to the first-act turn.

608
00:44:26.583 --> 00:44:28.583
You can't just stop mid-flow!

609
00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:31.666
I'm tired. And I'm thirsty.

610
00:44:31.791 --> 00:44:35.250
And I want to go into town and
drink negronis like we used to.

611
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:37.375
But it's getting late.

612
00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:41.916
You really have got a little too
comfortable in your slippers, Charles.

613
00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:14.125
What do you want, Elvira?

614
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:15.292
Want?

615
00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:17.083
I don't know what you mean.

616
00:45:17.833 --> 00:45:20.208
I remember whenever you
got overwhelmingly demure,

617
00:45:20.292 --> 00:45:22.250
it usually meant that
you wanted something.

618
00:45:22.334 --> 00:45:24.791
It's horrid of you to be so suspicious.

619
00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:28.250
All I want is to be alone with you.

620
00:45:29.417 --> 00:45:32.916
I can't deny, I do feel rather
peculiar seeing you again.

621
00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:37.916
I've missed you more than life itself.

622
00:45:39.083 --> 00:45:40.625
I've missed you too.

623
00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:43.958
My American dream.

624
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.791
I was utterly heartbroken
after the accident.

625
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.897
The truth is, I don't believe I
ever really got over losing you.

626
00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:04.292
Do you love Ruth?

627
00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:07.125
Of course I do.

628
00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:11.125
As much as you loved me?

629
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.292
Don't be silly.

630
00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:18.500
It's entirely different.

631
00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:22.459
I'm so glad.

632
00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:26.791
Nothing could've ever been
quite the same, could it?

633
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.916
Let's go to Soho.

634
00:46:38.125 --> 00:46:40.791
Swap those slippers
for some dancing shoes.

635
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:14.292
Slow down!

636
00:47:14.417 --> 00:47:17.875
- I think I'm going to be sick!
- Charles!

637
00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:24.833
Oh, I love being back
behind the wheel of a car!

638
00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:26.916
I can't say the feeling's mutual.

639
00:47:27.042 --> 00:47:30.666
Charles? Where on earth have
you been? I've been worried sick.

640
00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:32.791
It's too bad it's not terminal.

641
00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:36.459
I wanted to clear my
head, so I took a long drive.

642
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:38.125
In the passenger seat?

643
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.666
Let's not quarrel when
we should be celebrating.

644
00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:46.334
I finished the first act of my
screenplay, and it's rather good.

645
00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.000
My screenplay, more like.

646
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:50.625
How did you manage that in a day?

647
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.916
- Elvira helped me.
- Do you mean to tell me

648
00:47:55.042 --> 00:47:58.459
that not only has she bullied
her way back over the threshold,

649
00:47:58.583 --> 00:48:00.708
she's trying to work
with you now as well?

650
00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:04.250
What do you mean, trying? I've
written 15 books in your name.

651
00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:06.500
Elvira, this is neither
the time nor the place.

652
00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:08.666
This is intolerable.

653
00:48:08.791 --> 00:48:12.208
- Elvira, now, you listen to me.
- Darling...

654
00:48:12.334 --> 00:48:14.292
- I... Yes?
- She's over there.

655
00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.167
Right.

656
00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:21.583
Now, listen here, Elvira,

657
00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:25.417
I've been to see Madame Arcati,
and she's going to send you back

658
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:28.583
to wherever it is she
regrettably dragged you from.

659
00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:31.625
Charles? Charles?

660
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.250
Don't.

661
00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:50.583
Darling, please don't be upset.

662
00:48:51.042 --> 00:48:53.750
Upset? You've just spent
the night with your ex-wife.

663
00:48:53.875 --> 00:48:56.125
How do you expect me to feel?

664
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.250
Ecstatic.

665
00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:02.708
Our dream of going to Hollywood
is finally within our grasp.

666
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.375
As soon as I deliver the screenplay,

667
00:49:04.459 --> 00:49:08.708
we'll be crossing the Atlantic quicker
than you can say <i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

668
00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:13.334
Think of the glitz, the glamour,

669
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.875
the good times we're going to share.

670
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.292
You won't be reading about
other people's lives anymore.

671
00:49:20.417 --> 00:49:22.208
They'll be reading about ours.

672
00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:34.708
And you can't do it without her?

673
00:49:36.708 --> 00:49:40.334
Of course I can. It will just
be a lot quicker this way.

674
00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:45.791
There's really no need
for you to be jealous.

675
00:49:46.791 --> 00:49:48.500
You're the one I love.

676
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.791
Forgive me that I don't tell you enough.

677
00:49:55.708 --> 00:50:01.000
Now that the words are flowing, I
feel unblocked in other areas too.

678
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:09.208
Promise me you can't touch her.

679
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:15.208
Darling... she's a ghost.

680
00:50:17.292 --> 00:50:20.417
And, besides, the only
woman I want to touch is you.

681
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:03.417
Listen here, lady.

682
00:51:04.417 --> 00:51:07.000
You may have summoned me into this world,

683
00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:10.875
but there's no way I'm going
to let you send me back again.

684
00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:15.583
I'm here to stay. Is that clear?

685
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:53.375
How dare you ignore me,
you meddling old crone?

686
00:51:54.208 --> 00:51:57.334
Either you leave me
in peace to live my life,

687
00:51:57.459 --> 00:52:00.292
or I'll haunt you until the day you die.

688
00:52:11.875 --> 00:52:15.000
The tower. Symbol of chaos,

689
00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:20.334
destruction and devastation.

690
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.375
Wakey-wakey.

691
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.167
Rise and shine.

692
00:52:38.708 --> 00:52:40.583
What was I, Charles?

693
00:52:40.708 --> 00:52:42.375
The warm-up act?

694
00:52:45.334 --> 00:52:47.250
If I was you, I'd keep it there.

695
00:52:52.208 --> 00:52:53.625
Good afternoon, ma'am.

696
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.707
I'm going to have to correct you, Edith.

697
00:52:55.791 --> 00:52:58.625
It's not a good afternoon,
it's a glorious one.

698
00:53:00.042 --> 00:53:03.375
- Should I prepare lunch?
- Yes, please. You read my mind.

699
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.750
I'm absolutely famished.

700
00:53:04.875 --> 00:53:08.708
I'll have a cheese and
pickle platter, with extra pickle.

701
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:10.791
Yes, ma'am.

702
00:53:14.375 --> 00:53:17.833
- What happened to your leg?
- I slipped down the staircase.

703
00:53:17.958 --> 00:53:20.541
You really must refrain from
doing everything at the double.

704
00:53:20.625 --> 00:53:22.250
You're not in the navy, you know.

705
00:53:22.334 --> 00:53:26.916
I wasn't hurrying, ma'am. There was
axle grease smeared all over the top step.

706
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:34.666
<i>Yes, her agent loves the pitch.</i>

707
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:37.292
<i>Thinks it would be a
perfect vehicle for her.</i>

708
00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:39.625
- Seriously? Greta Garbo?
<i>- Yes.</i>

709
00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.999
Mata Hari speaking my words
would be a dream come true.

710
00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:46.500
<i>- Charles, are you still on track?</i>
- Yes, absolutely still on track.

711
00:53:46.625 --> 00:53:50.041
I'll send the next ream of pages over
as soon as I reach the second-act turn.

712
00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:51.791
<i>- Don't let me down.</i>
- Thank you, Henry.

713
00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:54.459
And I appreciate your
continued patience and belief.

714
00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:56.000
<i>- Splendid.</i>
- Goodbye.

715
00:54:45.208 --> 00:54:49.666
- Elvira, what are you doing?
- "Greta Garbo speaking my words"?

716
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:53.292
Darling, what am I supposed to
say? That I've got a ghost writer?

717
00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:56.981
Stop it. Elvira, that's
one of our wedding gifts.

718
00:54:57.083 --> 00:54:59.583
Not ours, Charles. Hers!

719
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:08.000
You care more about breaking china
than you do about breaking my heart.

720
00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:14.833
Elvira, I was unwaveringly
loyal and faithful to you

721
00:55:14.958 --> 00:55:16.500
in all our years of marriage.

722
00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:18.582
What was I supposed to do after you died?

723
00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:22.000
Become a recluse and wear a
black armband for the rest of my life?

724
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:30.958
- Ma'am, the garden judges are here.
- Oh, thank you, Edith.

725
00:55:43.916 --> 00:55:46.292
We've been sabotaged.

726
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.167
Oh, that is an outrageous suggestion.

727
00:56:06.292 --> 00:56:08.789
As the national director
of the Spiritual Alliance,

728
00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:12.292
my job is to protect the reputation
of genuine psychic practitioners,

729
00:56:12.417 --> 00:56:13.791
not undermine them.

730
00:56:13.916 --> 00:56:17.125
And I vow, along with
my friend, Harry Houdini,

731
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:20.958
to investigate and expose
every fraudulent spiritualist

732
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:22.750
operating in this country.

733
00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:24.750
Come in.

734
00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:29.250
- Madame Arcati here to see you.
<i>- Thank you for your time.</i>

735
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:33.791
Yes. Well, no, thank you. Always
a pleasure to talk to the press.

736
00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:34.958
<i>Goodbye.</i>

737
00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:38.541
You've got a cheek, showing
your face while you're suspended.

738
00:56:39.459 --> 00:56:43.500
I'm sorry to turn up unannounced,
but I urgently need your guidance.

739
00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:48.583
I have pulled off a
level-ten manifestation.

740
00:56:49.666 --> 00:56:52.625
And was this before or
after you conned 800 people

741
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.291
into paying to see you levitate?

742
00:56:54.375 --> 00:56:56.083
No, really, you must believe me, Harry.

743
00:56:56.167 --> 00:56:59.417
And it is possible this
presence has a physical form.

744
00:57:02.334 --> 00:57:05.000
- Margot, where are the scissors?
- Drawer.

745
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.500
So, you're telling me

746
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:12.292
that the first level-ten manifestation
reported in over three centuries

747
00:57:12.417 --> 00:57:14.832
was the result of an ordinary
common-or-garden seance?

748
00:57:14.916 --> 00:57:16.625
Yes, that is correct.

749
00:57:18.083 --> 00:57:22.250
- What did you use as a guide?
- Oh, this.

750
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.292
<i>The Art of the Seance.</i>-

751
00:57:27.708 --> 00:57:31.083
- Can you help me?
- Yes, Madame Arcati, I think I can.

752
00:57:31.208 --> 00:57:33.459
Do you have your membership card?

753
00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.459
Membership card?

754
00:57:37.666 --> 00:57:39.083
Yes.

755
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:42.355
I'll start by terminating your
membership with immediate effect.

756
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.208
This is no place for
fantasists or frauds.

757
00:57:47.334 --> 00:57:48.500
Margot.

758
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.208
Madame Arcati is leaving now.

759
00:58:00.334 --> 00:58:03.125
Meet me in Temple Square in an hour.

760
00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:20.000
Chapter four, page nine, paragraph six.

761
00:58:24.541 --> 00:58:28.958
A banishing spell. Oh, Margot. Thank you.

762
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:32.583
We don't have long. I
need to replace it in the safe

763
00:58:32.708 --> 00:58:37.625
- before Mr. Price returns from lunch.
- It's recorded in ancient Druidic text.

764
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:40.125
I'm a little rusty but I'll do my best.

765
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.250
Oh, wait.

766
00:58:49.958 --> 00:58:53.666
"Take Ceridwen's brew of devil's claw."

767
00:58:54.334 --> 00:58:55.375
Devil's claw.

768
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.666
- "Poisoned root of aconite."
- Oh, yes.

769
00:58:59.459 --> 00:59:01.791
"Elixir of vervain flowers."

770
00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:04.916
Oh, yes, of course. That's
the enchanter's plant.

771
00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:17.083
"The sacrificial offering is at its
strongest with a waning moon."

772
00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:18.500
A waning moon.

773
00:59:19.708 --> 00:59:22.250
"Sprinkle black salt on a stone altar."

774
00:59:22.375 --> 00:59:23.625
Black salt.

775
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:27.042
"Then lay the freshly torn
bladder of a carnivore..."

776
00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:28.791
The bla... Bladder?

777
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:32.625
No.

778
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:35.375
"Freshly torn bladderwort..."-

779
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:39.459
"...of the carnivorous aquatic
<i>Utricularia</i> plant family."

780
00:59:39.583 --> 00:59:41.000
Oh, thank heavens.

781
00:59:41.125 --> 00:59:44.250
I thought I was going to
have to get my hands dirty.

782
00:59:47.833 --> 00:59:49.916
<i>Au revoir,</i> Madame Arcati.

783
00:59:51.791 --> 00:59:53.000
Good luck.

784
00:59:59.125 --> 01:00:01.583
Will you excuse me?

785
01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:07.083
What about Clark Gable? He'd make
a dashing Detective Frank Flowers.

786
01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.000
Good actor, terrible breath.

787
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.708
Very tricky for the leading ladies.

788
01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:14.417
- I was thinking Cary Grant.
- Now we're talking.

789
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:17.166
I look forward to making his
acquaintance at the premier.

790
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.250
Well, I'm afraid you're getting
ahead of yourself there, Mrs. Bradman.

791
01:00:20.334 --> 01:00:22.459
Even I can't make a
film without a script.

792
01:00:22.583 --> 01:00:25.580
It's rather like trying to perform
surgery without a patient.

793
01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.500
The typewriter can be a
cruel and demanding mistress.

794
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.666
Well, let's hope that's the
only affair Charles is having.

795
01:00:35.167 --> 01:00:36.292
Oh, yes.

796
01:00:37.292 --> 01:00:38.417
Hello, Daddy.

797
01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:40.958
Time for a speech.

798
01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.750
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

799
01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:53.250
A- As a writer,

800
01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:57.334
people are always expecting
me to come up with lots of words.

801
01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:00.666
Well, today, I'm sure
you'll all be relieved to hear

802
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:04.292
that I'm going to keep things
short and sweet, just like my wife.

803
01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:10.250
If I were to create a character
as beautiful, as poised,

804
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.583
as perfect as Ruth,

805
01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:13.583
my fans would accuse me

806
01:01:13.708 --> 01:01:16.375
of straying into fantasy.-

807
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.334
Thankfully we are all here
today to celebrate the fact

808
01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:21.083
that Ruth is my reality

809
01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:24.541
and has been for five fabulous years.

810
01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:31.958
So, let us be upstanding upstandingly,
and raise our glasses to true love.

811
01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.292
- Yeah.
- True love!

812
01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:37.208
- True love.
- True love.

813
01:01:37.334 --> 01:01:39.417
Never dies.

814
01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:15.375
- Lord Almighty!
- What on earth are you doing?

815
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.208
Cooling off. All that dancing
got me hot and sticky.

816
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.125
Everybody's looking!

817
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.083
I didn't know it was going
to be one of those parties.

818
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.000
You're as wet as an otter's pocket.

819
01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:31.750
- What happened to your dress?
- What happened to yours, Daddy?

820
01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:34.083
Everybody!

821
01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.666
Lovely, darling. I'm not
sure the fish are enjoying this.

822
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.582
<i>Why</i> don't you come upstairs
and have a little lie-down?

823
01:02:39.666 --> 01:02:41.417
Only if you're going to join me.

824
01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:49.875
Oh, make love to me
like it was the first time.

825
01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:56.500
Whee! Does Mr. Peasebody
want to come out and play?

826
01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:03.832
Well, I'm not surprised she
doesn't like to do it with the lights on.

827
01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:07.334
- Don't be so vulgar, Elvira.
- She's in here?

828
01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.958
Now, you listen to
me, you low-rent hussy.

829
01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:17.375
This is my party, my bedroom, my
house and Charles is my husband!

830
01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.000
What did she say?

831
01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:23.459
She apologized unreservedly and
has taken herself back downstairs.

832
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:27.167
You should've been an actor,
Charles. You really are rather good.

833
01:03:27.292 --> 01:03:30.417
Oh, darling. I'm sorry,
Charles. I'm just...

834
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.625
I'm not in the mood anymore.

835
01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.334
I am.

836
01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.459
Morning, darling.

837
01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:01.459
You look shattered.

838
01:04:01.583 --> 01:04:04.292
Yes, had a bit of a restless night.

839
01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:08.125
Yes. Yes, I thought you
were thrashing around a bit.

840
01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:13.459
I had Edna prepare
Norfolk kippers, your favorite.

841
01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.916
That's very sweet. I
could do with something hearty.

842
01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:20.208
I fear I rather overdid it
on the bubbles yesterday.

843
01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:24.666
Party went by in a bit of a blur.

844
01:04:25.417 --> 01:04:28.042
What are you stuck on?

845
01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:30.791
Twenty-two down,
Greek god of retribution.

846
01:04:30.916 --> 01:04:33.958
Seven letters, third
letter M, seventh letter S.

847
01:04:36.459 --> 01:04:37.750
Oh, Nemesis.

848
01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:07.750
- What on earth has happened?
- She said the place is cursed.

849
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.250
It's not safe! It's not safe at all!

850
01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:15.750
Edna? You can't leave us!

851
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:19.375
You can keep your job! No,
I'm getting out of here. Go away!

852
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.916
I'm having nothing to
do with you. Go away!

853
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:26.459
You can stick your
bleedin' job up your bum!

854
01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:42.250
There you are.

855
01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:44.292
There you are.

856
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.250
Now, to work.

857
01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:53.459
Yes.

858
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.083
Where are you?

859
01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:11.375
Detective, I don't see
how you can blame a girl

860
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.791
for falling in love with the
right guy for the wrong reasons.

861
01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:18.500
What about that poor
sap of a husband of yours?

862
01:06:18.625 --> 01:06:20.379
Guys like him are a dime
a dozen. What was he?

863
01:06:20.459 --> 01:06:22.624
The right guy in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

864
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:26.459
Oh, Detective, just being close to you,

865
01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.417
I feel as if I am completely naked.

866
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.833
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

867
01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:38.125
I see things just the way they are.

868
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.417
The rest of the world needs bifocals.

869
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:46.875
I'm not sure about that
last line. It feels too florid.

870
01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.208
It needs something
simple and to the point like...

871
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:56.208
That's my job, sweetie. I just do it.

872
01:06:57.541 --> 01:07:01.875
Whatever you prefer.
It's your name on the script.

873
01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:09.958
And, "Fade to black."

874
01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:15.999
Well, dare I say it? I think the film's
going to be even better than the book.

875
01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:19.459
We've finished ahead of the deadline.

876
01:07:19.583 --> 01:07:22.292
Just wait till I tell Ruth.

877
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.875
Let's not tell her just yet.

878
01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:36.875
Oh, for heaven's sake!

879
01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:40.625
Fiddlesticks!

880
01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:46.042
- Damn and blast!
- Are you all right, darling?

881
01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:48.124
Knowing you work your fingers to the bone

882
01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:51.958
makes it easier for me to
endure a few blisters and burns.

883
01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:57.750
Out of suffering have emerged
the strongest souls, my dear.

884
01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.640
I've nothing to serve for lunch.

885
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.547
Please don't worry about
it. I'm not in the least hungry.

886
01:08:05.417 --> 01:08:07.417
Dare I ask how it's going over there?

887
01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:12.708
- The finishing line is almost in sight.
- Thank goodness.

888
01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:15.541
I don't like you alone with her one iota,

889
01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:19.208
but if it means you're going to be
able to deliver the damned script,

890
01:08:19.334 --> 01:08:21.292
then I can just about tolerate it.

891
01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:24.375
You and I do make a good team, darling.

892
01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:31.167
I'd like us to move
our beds back together.

893
01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.541
Permanently.

894
01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:38.541
I think if we're going to be
separated during the days,

895
01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:43.167
the least we can do is spend our
nights together as man and wife.

896
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.750
Yes, I should like nothing more.

897
01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:53.875
I'm going to take a
walk, try to clear my head.

898
01:09:03.708 --> 01:09:06.875
Remember when we used to
play hide-and-seek along here,

899
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.375
and your reward when you found me?

900
01:09:13.833 --> 01:09:17.375
Look, isn't he handsome?

901
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:20.666
He's magnificent.

902
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:24.125
He can sense me.

903
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:28.375
How wonderful not to be
frightened of the unknown.

904
01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.167
You're not frightened, are you, Charles?

905
01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:38.083
- Of what?
- Falling back in love.

906
01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:44.167
How is that possible when we're
existing on two different planes?

907
01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:48.583
- I'm alive and you're...
- Don't... Don't say it.

908
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:54.750
I'm so sorry, Elvira. There's
no easy way to say this.

909
01:09:58.167 --> 01:10:01.958
But I'm struggling to see a future in us.

910
01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:18.541
You know, Charles, when you
give someone an eternity ring,

911
01:10:18.666 --> 01:10:21.375
it's supposed to be a
love that lasts forever.

912
01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:24.833
Charles?

913
01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.000
Charles, watch out!

914
01:11:06.125 --> 01:11:07.375
Damn!

915
01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:13.292
She's dangerous, Charles.

916
01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:16.958
Edna was almost scalped.
Look what happened to Edith.

917
01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:18.541
What are you suggesting?

918
01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:22.334
It's blindingly obvious
that Elvira came here

919
01:11:22.459 --> 01:11:24.666
for one purpose and one purpose only.

920
01:11:24.791 --> 01:11:27.417
She came here to have
you to herself forever.

921
01:11:28.916 --> 01:11:30.459
How?

922
01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:33.708
- By killing you off, of course.
- Oh, that's absurd.

923
01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:36.208
Do you really think the
cabinet climbed up onto the roof

924
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.791
and jumped off of its own accord?

925
01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:42.042
Elvira may be prone to temper
tantrums, but she still loves me.

926
01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.625
She'd never wish me any harm.

927
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.625
If you were dead, it would
be her final triumph over me.

928
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:51.547
She'd have you all to herself
on her beastly astral plane

929
01:11:51.666 --> 01:11:53.083
and I'd be left high and dry.

930
01:11:53.167 --> 01:11:56.014
She's probably planning
some sort of spiritual remarriage.

931
01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:02.708
What are we going to do?

932
01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:07.708
Yes, the guest's name is
Madame Arcati. Room 14.

933
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:10.833
<i>One moment. I'm sorry
but she left yesterday.</i>

934
01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:14.292
- I see. Did she leave any messages?
<i>- I'm afraid not.</i>

935
01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:16.417
Thank you.

936
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.250
She checked out yesterday.

937
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.541
There's nothing for it. I shall
have to get myself arrested,

938
01:12:24.625 --> 01:12:26.208
spend the night locked up in the cells.

939
01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:30.167
No, we just have to create
our own safe place for the night.

940
01:12:30.791 --> 01:12:31.916
Right.

941
01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.042
Now, gently does it.

942
01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.500
Oh, precious.

943
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:50.958
<i>Herba veneris,</i> nature's divine protector.

944
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.417
What are you doing with that?

945
01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:07.291
I've just removed all the heavy
and <i>sharp</i> objects for a reason.

946
01:13:07.375 --> 01:13:09.416
I thought you could
keep going with your script

947
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.042
while we're holed up in here.

948
01:13:13.167 --> 01:13:15.375
I've already finished it.

949
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.916
I thought you said you were struggling.

950
01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:21.167
On reflection, I think I was
overthinking the whole thing.

951
01:13:21.292 --> 01:13:23.208
I'll give the manuscript a quick read

952
01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:24.999
and drive it to the
studio in the morning.

953
01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh, Charles. What wonderful news.

954
01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.083
Daddy's going to be over the moon.

955
01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:32.083
- As am I.
- Thank you, darling.

956
01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:37.875
Now we can both focus on banishing
Elvira into oblivion once and for all.

957
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.042
Not a moment too soon. Two's company.

958
01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:42.000
Three's a nightmare.

959
01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:44.167
Mm.

960
01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:47.500
Nearly there.

961
01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:56.833
Vervain and dill hinder
witches from their will.

962
01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.125
Charles.

963
01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:28.334
Charles!

964
01:14:56.417 --> 01:14:57.417
Hello?

965
01:14:57.541 --> 01:14:59.583
<i>Mrs. Condomine, I have news.</i>

966
01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:02.334
Doors are opening
and change is in the air.

967
01:15:02.459 --> 01:15:04.375
<i>This is no time for riddles.</i>

968
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.458
<i>We've been urgently
trying to contact you.</i>

969
01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:11.459
Charles's life is in grave danger.
Elvira is trying to murder him.

970
01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.167
I feared she might
become a malevolent spirit.

971
01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:16.791
That's putting it mildly. Where are you?

972
01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:20.625
In Sussex. I've gathered everything
together and now I'm ready.

973
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.375
<i>- For what?</i>
- Well, to send her back, of course.

974
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.708
Stay put, Madame Arcati.
I'll come and collect you.

975
01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:33.833
The telephone woke me.
Apologies if I scared you.

976
01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:35.791
When Mr. Condomine wakes up,

977
01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:37.958
tell him I've gone to fetch Madame Arcati

978
01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.690
and I shall be back before lunch.

979
01:16:20.417 --> 01:16:21.875
Don't hurt me, I beg you!

980
01:16:22.459 --> 01:16:26.125
- Are you all right in there?
- I've never stopped loving you.

981
01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.334
I don't know what to say, sir.

982
01:16:30.459 --> 01:16:33.666
You have a funny way
of showing it, Charles.

983
01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:36.166
I was going to put your
name on the manuscript

984
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.916
before I delivered it, I promise.

985
01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:40.250
That won't be necessary, sir.

986
01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:43.250
I'm a woman. We're used to
not getting the credit we deserve.

987
01:16:43.334 --> 01:16:46.208
No, I insist. I'll get changed
and leave straight away.

988
01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:48.750
Mrs. Condomine left
in the car a while ago.

989
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.750
She said she'd be back by lunchtime.

990
01:16:51.334 --> 01:16:53.958
Elvira, what have you done?

991
01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:36.875
Mr. Condomine, I would just like
to say that I reproach myself bitterly.

992
01:18:37.958 --> 01:18:42.750
You are not to blame, Madame Arcati.
The fault lies squarely on my shoulders.

993
01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:48.625
It was my ambition and ego that
dragged us into this unbearable mess.

994
01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:52.713
That's something I shall have
to live with for the rest of my life.

995
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:57.500
The last time I spoke with Mrs.
Condomine, your life was in danger.

996
01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:01.554
I urge you to come and see me at
your earliest possible convenience.

997
01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:04.833
Here is my card. I'll be waiting.

998
01:19:06.791 --> 01:19:09.000
You're not going to
stay for refreshments?

999
01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:11.500
No, please, don't think me rude, but I...

1000
01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:16.666
I prefer to contemplate the passing
of a spirit in my own private way.

1001
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:23.541
My sincerest condolences, Mr. Condomine.

1002
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.375
Shouldn't that be "Congratulations"?

1003
01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:36.334
What the hell are you doing
here? Have you no shame?

1004
01:19:36.459 --> 01:19:39.791
It was an accident, Charles.
I was trying to kill you.

1005
01:19:39.916 --> 01:19:44.250
- How can you be so heartless?
- Death does that to you.

1006
01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.791
You know, you can always tell
how well regarded someone is

1007
01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:51.313
- by the attendance at their funeral.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1008
01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:53.666
Bit of a poor turnout
today, if you ask me.

1009
01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:55.750
I barely counted 40 people.

1010
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.875
That does it.

1011
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.125
Come here!

1012
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:04.125
Just like old times, Charles!

1013
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:07.250
With you chasing me round the garden.

1014
01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:11.042
Today there's going to
be a different outcome.

1015
01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:19.833
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

1016
01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:31.125
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Mackintosh.

1017
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:34.334
Ruth was a fine woman and a good friend.

1018
01:20:35.292 --> 01:20:37.167
I'm going to miss her deeply.

1019
01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:41.125
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman. I
know she was fond of you too.

1020
01:20:42.375 --> 01:20:44.417
I can't quite believe she's gone.

1021
01:20:46.334 --> 01:20:50.708
My mother always said that time
is a physician that heals every grief.

1022
01:21:00.334 --> 01:21:04.708
You never were much of an
opponent on the croquet lawn, Charles.

1023
01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:06.541
You repulse me.

1024
01:21:09.042 --> 01:21:10.958
I'm going to kill you!

1025
01:21:14.583 --> 01:21:16.833
Don't be an imbecile. I'm already dead.

1026
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.541
You better fetch your medicinal
bag before someone else gets killed.

1027
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:24.666
Edna was right. This place is cursed.

1028
01:21:25.459 --> 01:21:29.459
- I can't bear to see you ever again.
- The feeling's mutual, Charles.

1029
01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:32.958
With age and disappointment,
you've become a pompous ass.

1030
01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:35.583
Charles! Charles!

1031
01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:40.749
- Everything's going to be splendid.
- Not while she's here, it won't.

1032
01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:43.083
- Not while who's here?
- Elvira!

1033
01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.875
- Where am I?
- In the loony bin.

1034
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.167
What?

1035
01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.500
There's no point in struggling, Charles.

1036
01:22:18.583 --> 01:22:21.750
The more you thrash around,
the longer they'll keep you in.

1037
01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:23.042
Why am I here?

1038
01:22:23.167 --> 01:22:25.624
You've been sectioned
under the Mental Treatment Act

1039
01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:28.375
and held under mandatory
observation for the next 28 days.

1040
01:22:28.459 --> 01:22:30.666
I hope you rot in hell.

1041
01:22:30.791 --> 01:22:34.708
It's not wise to be bad-tempered
with the only person who can help you.

1042
01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:37.541
I'd rather eat my tongue
than ask you for help!

1043
01:22:37.666 --> 01:22:39.083
You might get to do that.

1044
01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:41.916
Dr. McEwan is planning on taking
you down the corridor in 15 minutes

1045
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.333
for electric-shock treatment.

1046
01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:45.083
What?

1047
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:48.459
No! No, come back. Wait.

1048
01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:52.375
There's usually a way
around these things.

1049
01:22:52.916 --> 01:22:54.791
What do you want from me?

1050
01:22:57.167 --> 01:22:59.500
I know you're never going
to forgive me, Charles,

1051
01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:03.459
and being stuck in purgatory with
you grieving over another woman

1052
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.583
is a fate worse than death.

1053
01:23:05.708 --> 01:23:08.000
I couldn't agree more.

1054
01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:11.250
Which is why I want a divorce.

1055
01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:13.541
With pleasure.

1056
01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:17.625
And I know just the person
who can execute that.

1057
01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:28.125
Good.

1058
01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:37.666
Move over. There's no way I'm
putting my life in your hands again.

1059
01:23:37.791 --> 01:23:40.416
Don't flatter yourself. When I
think of what might've happened

1060
01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.458
if I'd succeeded in getting you to
the other side, it makes me shudder.

1061
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:47.000
Nothing but bickering
and squabbling for eternity.

1062
01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.250
Drive.

1063
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.749
Looking back on our married years,

1064
01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:02.180
I can see now, with horrid clarity,
they were nothing but a mockery.

1065
01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:07.583
You were feckless,
irresponsible, morally unstable.

1066
01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:10.333
I realized that before
we left Budleigh Salterton.

1067
01:24:10.417 --> 01:24:12.375
Nobody but a monumental bore

1068
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.124
would've thought of going to
Budleigh Salterton for a honeymoon.

1069
01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.958
What's the matter with
Budleigh Salterton?

1070
01:24:17.042 --> 01:24:19.375
Seven hours a day on a damp golf course

1071
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.334
and a three-piece orchestra
playing <i>Merrie England.</i>

1072
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.791
I'm surprised you didn't
complain at the time.

1073
01:24:24.916 --> 01:24:26.749
I remember you being quite good at that.

1074
01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:29.375
I did complain, but you wouldn't listen.

1075
01:24:30.417 --> 01:24:35.459
That's why I took a romantic stroll
on the moors with Captain Bracegirdle.

1076
01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:37.459
What a blind fool I was.

1077
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:41.958
- Did he make love to you?
- Only very discreetly.

1078
01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:51.541
Mr. Condomine, I'm so
relieved you've arrived safely.

1079
01:24:52.167 --> 01:24:55.875
Follow me. Tonight the moon is
full and we must harness its power.

1080
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.147
We're both ready to perform the
banishment ceremony immediately.

1081
01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:03.541
- She's here?
- Yes.

1082
01:25:03.666 --> 01:25:06.708
Are you sure she's
amenable to the process?

1083
01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.417
Yes.

1084
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:19.459
With this magic smoke, I
invoke the spirit of moonfire.

1085
01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:24.083
Dancer of time, mistress
of endings and beginnings...

1086
01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:26.791
...to return our sacred sister

1087
01:25:26.916 --> 01:25:28.791
to her rightful sphere.

1088
01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.916
- Still here?
- Yes.

1089
01:25:35.583 --> 01:25:37.875
To you, the spirit of earth.

1090
01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:41.375
To you, the element of air.

1091
01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:44.375
To you, the force of water.

1092
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.000
To you, the power of fire

1093
01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:50.541
and the gift of enchanter's dew.

1094
01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:57.583
- She still here?
- Yes.

1095
01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:58.958
Yes!

1096
01:25:59.791 --> 01:26:03.375
Ghostly specter, ghoul and fiend,

1097
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.250
never more be thou convened.

1098
01:26:06.375 --> 01:26:09.083
Wolf's bane and holy rite,

1099
01:26:09.208 --> 01:26:11.292
banish thee into the night.

1100
01:26:14.541 --> 01:26:17.916
Oh, bladderwort,
bladderwort! Bladderwort.

1101
01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:21.417
Oh, yes. Come.

1102
01:26:22.083 --> 01:26:26.666
Yes. And... bladderwort.

1103
01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:33.417
- Ruth!
- Ruth?

1104
01:26:33.541 --> 01:26:36.375
I'm so happy to see you again.

1105
01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:40.806
Blast! How could I
have been such a duffer?

1106
01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:42.791
Something must have gone hideously wrong.

1107
01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:44.375
Yes, not for the first time.

1108
01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:47.083
- You hussy!
- Darling?

1109
01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:50.625
Save yourself the
effort. I'm already dead.

1110
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:53.083
And more to the point, so are you.-

1111
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.666
- You popped your clogs last Tuesday.
- Don't be so insensitive.

1112
01:26:57.167 --> 01:26:58.958
Darling, are you in any pain?

1113
01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:03.167
Charles, what happened to me?

1114
01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:05.624
There was a car accident.

1115
01:27:05.708 --> 01:27:08.334
Which, I have to admit, I had a hand in.

1116
01:27:08.459 --> 01:27:09.583
I'm sorry, Ruth.

1117
01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:11.708
I'm afraid "sorry" doesn't quite cut it.

1118
01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:16.375
Well, even so. In the spirit of complete
openness, I'd also like to apologize

1119
01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.447
for conducting an affair with
Charles right under your nose.

1120
01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.416
Technically, we are still married, so...

1121
01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.666
Stop it, Elvira.

1122
01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:29.042
- Ruth has been through quite enough.
- What are they saying, Mr. Condomine?

1123
01:27:29.167 --> 01:27:31.916
Not now, Madame Arcati. Things
are becoming quite strained.

1124
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.750
I should have squeezed
<i>malum citrea</i> at the crucial point.

1125
01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.583
That's lemon juice.

1126
01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:40.833
The only reason he was
able to through that screenplay

1127
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.998
in five days flat is because I wrote it.

1128
01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:46.708
- Yes...
- Charles, is that true?

1129
01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:48.541
Not exactly.

1130
01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:52.334
Charles didn't want
to tell you we'd finished

1131
01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:54.956
because he wanted to spend
more time alone with me.

1132
01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:58.750
Charles...

1133
01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:02.875
- Let's not fight, darling.
- Which darling are you referring to?

1134
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.625
After everything I put up with,
how could you do that to me?

1135
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:09.625
It's not that straightforward, darlings.

1136
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:13.459
I mean, really, Charles,
you never loved Elvira or me.

1137
01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:16.459
The only person that
you love is yourself!

1138
01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.125
No...

1139
01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:20.708
Finally, something we <i>do</i> agree on.

1140
01:28:23.208 --> 01:28:24.833
If you wrote the script,

1141
01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:29.083
- did he write any of those books?
- No, not a word.

1142
01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:31.624
- He took all the glory?
- Won't you stay for the second act?

1143
01:28:31.708 --> 01:28:33.167
I think it's best I leave.

1144
01:28:33.292 --> 01:28:35.875
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

1145
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.250
Try two of them.

1146
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.375
Good luck with the lemons.

1147
01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:43.334
Where did he go?

1148
01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.334
- He can run.
- But he can't hide.

1149
01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:05.750
Ghostly specter, ghoul or fiend,

1150
01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:08.541
never more be thou convened.

1151
01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:12.791
Bladderwort, wolf's bane and holy rite,

1152
01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:16.042
banish thee into the night.

1153
01:29:30.042 --> 01:29:31.375
Donald?

1154
01:30:01.583 --> 01:30:04.042
All right, I'm gonna start
with this medium shot.

1155
01:30:04.167 --> 01:30:07.958
Then I'm gonna come in a little
closer. Let's have some passion!

1156
01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:09.708
All right, roll the camera.

1157
01:30:12.250 --> 01:30:14.625
- Quiet, please!
- Sound running!

1158
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:16.125
Scene 84, take one.

1159
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.708
And action.

1160
01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:24.875
Just being close to you, Frank,
I feel as if I'm completely naked.

1161
01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:30.250
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

1162
01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.125
That's my job, sweetie. I just do it.

1163
01:30:35.417 --> 01:30:37.916
Cut!

1164
01:30:38.042 --> 01:30:39.375
Reset.

1165
01:30:40.459 --> 01:30:46.125
I'm not feeling the last line.
Boy Wonder, what else you got?

1166
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:49.250
Well...

1167
01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:56.791
What about, "I see things
just the way they are.

1168
01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:59.459
The rest of the world needs bifocals"?

1169
01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:06.334
I love it. OK, reset. Makeup.

1170
01:31:06.459 --> 01:31:08.541
I want to move in closer.

1171
01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.042
You're a genius, Charles.

1172
01:31:11.167 --> 01:31:14.666
Audiences are going to devour
the whole spiritualist angle.

1173
01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:15.875
Yeah.

1174
01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:20.958
It's just a shame Ruth
isn't here to enjoy it.

1175
01:31:24.791 --> 01:31:28.417
Mr. Condomine? Hedda
Hopper, <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

1176
01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:31.875
Hello.

1177
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.749
How does it feel to
be the talk of the town?

1178
01:31:33.833 --> 01:31:35.041
That's awfully sweet of you,

1179
01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:37.541
but I'm not sure anybody's
interested in the lowly writer.

1180
01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:42.500
Oh, I have a hunch that my 35
million readers will be enthralled

1181
01:31:42.625 --> 01:31:46.167
- by the story of a serial plagiarist.
- Plagiarist?

1182
01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:48.666
I know you revel in gossip
and scandal, <i>Miss</i> Hopper,

1183
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.624
but that's a completely outrageous
and unfounded accusation.

1184
01:31:51.708 --> 01:31:55.666
There is nothing unfounded about
the writ Señor Morales is serving.

1185
01:31:55.791 --> 01:31:57.833
Would you care to comment on the fact

1186
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.042
that your 15 Detective
Frank Flowers whodunnits

1187
01:32:01.167 --> 01:32:05.000
are based word for word on the
Inspector Francisco Flores crime novels

1188
01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:07.625
which are bestsellers
across all of Mexico?

1189
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.000
Say "Cheese," Mr. Condomine.

1190
01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:13.000
You!

1191
01:32:14.666 --> 01:32:16.583
Don't look so shocked, Charles.

1192
01:32:16.708 --> 01:32:19.916
You and I both know there's
no such thing as an original story.

1193
01:32:20.541 --> 01:32:22.750
- How could you?
- Can't you just be quiet?

1194
01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:27.875
- I'm trying to make a picture here!
- You scheming little witch.

1195
01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:30.791
So much for the famous British charm.

1196
01:32:31.459 --> 01:32:34.583
<i>I'll be loving you always</i>

1197
01:32:35.459 --> 01:32:38.916
- <i>With a love that's true, always</i>
- No. Stop it. No!

1198
01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:42.459
- Stop it! No!
<i>- Your first novel?</i>

1199
01:32:42.583 --> 01:32:45.083
<i>- Greta Garbo speaking my words.</i>
- Stop it!

1200
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.958
<i>You and I both know there</i>'s
<i>no such thing as an original story.</i>

1201
01:32:48.042 --> 01:32:49.416
<i>Promise you can't touch her.</i>

1202
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.208
<i>I'm a woman. We're used to
not getting the credit we deserve.</i>

1203
01:32:52.292 --> 01:32:55.625
<i>The only person that
you love is yourself.</i>

1204
01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.250
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1205
01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:07.500
- You could've killed me!
- I just did.

1206
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:19.500
Nobody will ever forget you, Charles.

1207
01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:22.958
They'll remember what
a fraud you were. Always.

1208
01:33:31.459 --> 01:33:34.500
Farewell, Mr. Peasebody!

1209
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:37.250
You can't just leave me here.

1210
01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:48.750
Read all about it! Read all about it!

1211
01:33:48.875 --> 01:33:52.750
Murdered British crime writer
revealed to be serial plagiarist!

1212
01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:57.750
Oh, poor Charles. How dreadful.

1213
01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:01.666
It's like a plot from one of his novels.

1214
01:34:01.791 --> 01:34:04.708
Or perhaps from someone else's.

1215
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.459
Is anybody there? Is anybody there?

1216
01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:18.750
One knock for yes, two knocks for no.

1217
01:34:18.875 --> 01:34:20.250
Yes, I'm here.

1218
01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:23.500
Whatever happened to leaving
someone to rest in peace?

1219
01:34:23.625 --> 01:34:26.417
Mr. Condomine, I simply
wanted to apologize

1220
01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:30.000
for any part I may have
played in your untimely demise.

1221
01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:32.500
You weren't behind the
wheel, Madame Arcati.

1222
01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:36.083
No, but I fear I may
have put fuel in the tank.

1223
01:34:36.208 --> 01:34:37.875
Well, <i>c'est la vie.</i>

1224
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.083
I also wanted to express my gratitude.

1225
01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.541
Without you, I would still be searching.

1226
01:34:43.666 --> 01:34:46.750
Well, at least one of us is
enjoying a happy ending.

1227
01:34:46.875 --> 01:34:49.459
May I be so bold as to ask

1228
01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:51.958
what it's like on the other side?

1229
01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:54.125
- Charles?
- Charles?

1230
01:34:54.292 --> 01:34:55.500
Complicated!

1231
01:38:57.250 --> 01:39:00.625
