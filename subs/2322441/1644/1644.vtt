1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,880
My name is Max William Easton.

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:03,560
<i>I'm a British Intelligence officer.</i>

3
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:04,841
<i>There's no point taking out</i>

4
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,926
<i>their scientists</i>

5
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:07,553
<i>if we don't take out the financiers.</i>

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,896
Once we get to the truth, you
can help us get it out there.

7
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,333
Angus, it's Olivia. I've got
something. Can I come in?

8
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,168
<i>Kahani walked Ardavan into an ambush.</i>

9
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:16,295
Clearly, he's no lawyer.

10
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:17,861
- Maybe he's Agency.
- Who sent him?

11
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,453
Oh!

12
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:24,915
I found this on White's phone.

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,225
Maybe it's not a phone number.

14
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,784
Stay with me, you bastard.

15
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:29,957
<i>Ashkan Davoud, a scientist
with detailed knowledge...</i>

16
00:00:29,982 --> 00:00:31,444
<i>Detailed knowledge of what we believe</i>

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,644
<i>to be Tehran's reactivated program.</i>

18
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,103
There is no such program.

19
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:37,103
Everything you're gonna say is in here.

20
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,223
What evidence would you have
to back up your claim?

21
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:41,519
<i>They're gonna want verification.</i>

22
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:42,678
There's no silver bullet.

23
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:43,937
Intelligence that helps them

24
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:46,132
complete the picture.
Soil samples, air, water.

25
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,599
Whoever we send out there,

26
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:49,181
they can't come back.

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,169
So, how are you doing, Jordan?

28
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:58,345
Like a guy with only the gym
to occupy him.

29
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:01,223
- Adjusting okay?
- Mary Anne and I

30
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:04,318
have another baby on the way,
so there's that.

31
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:06,787
Could do without the fan club, though.

32
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:08,320
Don't deserve it.

33
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,695
Don't like celebrity, huh?

34
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,327
It's just kind of weird
being praised for something

35
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,320
I don't even do anymore.

36
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,224
What would you say
if I told you we had a mission?

37
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,671
One that could amount to plenty,
change everything?

38
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:20,584
I guess I'd repeat the words

39
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,511
my shrink keeps telling me.

40
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,405
"Change is good.

41
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,974
Change keeps us alive."

42
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,866
- Did he give you anything?
- No.

43
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,734
Nothing.

44
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,273
George?

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,872
Who was it?

46
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,287
Agency, most likely.

47
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,176
They'll come looking for him.

48
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,684
- How long do you think we have?
- I don't know.

49
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:32,734
If this isn't a phone number,
we need to find out what it is.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,891
The fire alarm was a feint,

51
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,518
which means they probably snatched White

52
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,579
on his way to the school,
so start at the school,

53
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,915
move out from there. CCTV. ANPR.

54
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,809
Anything that we think we can use, okay?

55
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,219
- Call on White's line.
- Thanks.

56
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:47,903
Hello?

57
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,502
<i>Who is this?</i>

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,207
<i>Elliot Taylor.</i>

59
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,509
Where's George White?

60
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,309
Listen to me. This is Amanda Jones.

61
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,512
You better tell me what the fuck
is going on over there,

62
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,644
<i>and think twice before you lie to me.</i>

63
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,347
I can't get them to work as coordinates.

64
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:06,577
IP address?

65
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,035
It's a call sign.

66
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,297
You substitute a letter
for the first number

67
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,457
in each of the batches.

68
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:14,793
November, seven, one, four, X-Ray,

69
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:17,203
Yankee, Yankee, nine, zero, zero, golf.

70
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:18,776
It's an aircraft call sign.

71
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:21,017
Maybe White organized
a flight for Davoud.

72
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,268
Yeah, that's possible.

73
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:23,404
What do you mean, possible?

74
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,997
Have a bit of faith in your old man.

75
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,756
Hey.

76
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:30,717
Kahani's dead.

77
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:32,858
What happened?

78
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,528
He knew I was onto him.

79
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:35,996
He came after me.

80
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:37,131
Are you okay?

81
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,925
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
- You sure?

82
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,223
I'm fine, Harry.

83
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,432
Okay, I'm just...
I'm here with Max now.

84
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,704
I'm putting you on speaker.

85
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,140
Kahani's dead.

86
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:47,919
- What?
- Where are you now?

87
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,472
In his house.

88
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,224
<i>I found two phones hidden.</i>

89
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,287
A message came up on one of them.

90
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,683
"Operation Green Light.
Thursday, 1:00 a.m."

91
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,122
"Confirm." Number's blocked.

92
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,234
- Did you check the phone history?
<i>- I did.</i>

93
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,148
Every time Kahani
received a message on one phone,

94
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:04,376
he'd send the exact same message
via the second phone

95
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,469
to another blocked number.

96
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:06,959
So he was a bridge?

97
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,130
Yeah, between who?

98
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,896
I'm on it.

99
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,156
I'm coming out there.

100
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,587
No.

101
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:15,394
<i>I don't need you to look after me.</i>

102
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:17,898
I know you don't
need looking after, Leyla.

103
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:19,191
- Just...<i>
- Harry.</i>

104
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,808
I'm fine.

105
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,486
Okay?

106
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,820
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

107
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,887
She wouldn't be in this shit
if it wasn't for me,

108
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,333
- and...
- You absolutely have to go.

109
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:41,208
I'll stay here, keep on the call
signs, see where it leads.

110
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,462
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,923
Right.

112
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:04,063
I've never been much good at this.

113
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,135
We never really got a chance, did we?

114
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,570
To what?

115
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,361
To...

116
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:15,660
Hey.

117
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,982
Okay.

118
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:16,131
Pullman.

119
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:17,311
I've got something for you.

120
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,864
<i>You'll need to rally the troops.</i>

121
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,328
Thank God. Been sort of...

122
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,087
praying for some action
over here, ma'am.

123
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:26,053
It's not that kind of action.
Not yet, anyway.

124
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,813
I made coffee.

125
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:58,851
Yes, please.

126
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,932
How are the girls?

127
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,693
Asleep.

128
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,053
Chloe won't stop talking about him.

129
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:16,922
Her new big brother.

130
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,786
It's incredible how fast kids adjust,

131
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,789
accept things,

132
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,352
anything, as normal.

133
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,791
I can't.

134
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,432
I know.

135
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,032
What's out there in the barn?

136
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,487
All the things I can't ask.

137
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,291
Who was he?

138
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,697
The man in the video.

139
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,699
The man you killed.

140
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,169
He was a...

141
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,820
scientist.

142
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,935
He worked for the British government.

143
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,439
Did you know him?

144
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,805
Not personally, no.

145
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,863
They wanted him silenced.

146
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,864
I silenced him.

147
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,721
How many?

148
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,586
How many have you...

149
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,813
...silenced?

150
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,022
You don't know?

151
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,000
Of course you know.

152
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:44,631
You never questioned it?

153
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,776
Not at first.

154
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,806
I believed what they told me.

155
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,515
That we were making a difference.

156
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,161
Making the world a safer place.

157
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,063
And did you?

158
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:06,750
No.

159
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,086
Not really.

160
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,065
Blood begets blood, they say,
and it never ends.

161
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,238
That's why I left.

162
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,507
But you didn't.

163
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,483
Did you?

164
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,210
Leave?

165
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:26,412
I'm gonna fix this, Anna.

166
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,415
This whole mess, I'm gonna fix it.

167
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,783
I promise.

168
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,394
So that you and the girls are safe.

169
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,744
Mm-hmm.

170
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,721
Operation Green Light
will commence at 0100 hours.

171
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,802
The Alin power plant.

172
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,022
We'll get you as close as we can

173
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,022
to carry out meaningful tests.

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,522
We know there is no silver bullet here.

175
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:23,553
We just need anything

176
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,508
that can corroborate
Davoud's testimony...

177
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,599
soil samples, air, water.

178
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:28,748
Yes.

179
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,814
I was on the IAEA inspection team.

180
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,469
That's why we picked you, Ms. De Silva.

181
00:13:32,494 --> 00:13:34,262
Alin was never on itinerary.

182
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,435
Because it is
a conventional power plant.

183
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,647
We believe the Iranians
are adapting this facility

184
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:40,820
and using it to skirt
the provisions of the deal.

185
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:42,608
Can we get our inspectors in there?

186
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:44,337
We've requested access to the site.

187
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:45,911
It's been denied by Tehran.

188
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:48,811
Look...

189
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,953
I will be straight with you.

190
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,453
This is a high-risk operation.

191
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,720
If any of you choose not to go,

192
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,915
no one in this room will think
any worse of you.

193
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:04,606
Rest assured we're placing you
in the best possible hands.

194
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:06,619
Major Franklin.

195
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,489
Thank you.

196
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:16,637
I know you're nervous.

197
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,577
Understandable.

198
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,780
We'll get you in, and then
we'll bring you home again.

199
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,055
All right?

200
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,804
Mama?

201
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,860
I have so much love for you.

202
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:42,834
We got an accident report.

203
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,053
This is where the collision happened.

204
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:45,514
- CCTV?
- None.

205
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,973
Okay, check all the houses
on the street.

206
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:48,806
See if any of them have
a home security cam.

207
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:49,939
Elliot, this is...

208
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:53,241
Seth Pullman. You're Elliot?

209
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,933
- I am.
- I was expecting a man.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,569
Well, you got me.

211
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,789
Amanda Jones sent me to assist you

212
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,513
in the search for George White.

213
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,594
We can manage.

214
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,562
Thank you.

215
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,945
I don't have a choice, do I?

216
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:18,630
I prefer not to think of it
in those terms.

217
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:49,021
You didn't need to come.

218
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,441
Huh?

219
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,871
What was that?

220
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,558
How was the six-hour flight?

221
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,895
Yeah, it was all right.
Uh, watched a film,

222
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,091
the food was actually
half decent. Yeah.

223
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:04,069
You're thirsty? You want some coffee?
Something to eat?

224
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,678
Yeah, coffee would be great. Thanks.

225
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,249
So...

226
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,957
where is he?

227
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,104
Ah. Thanks.

228
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,967
So, what you got?

229
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,545
Kahani had our kill list.

230
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,241
Was he Agency?

231
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:53,831
I don't know. Come look at this.

232
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,515
- This is our original list, right?
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,856
Every single one of these CVs
in our briefing papers.

234
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,311
Yeah. And?

235
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:01,994
They were a lie.

236
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,295
They made out the scientists
to be much higher up the chain

237
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,431
than they were. See these?

238
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,900
These are their original CVs.

239
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:10,653
All right, how'd you know?

240
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:13,050
I went through Kahani's files.

241
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,506
Remember Ahmadi,
the last guy on our list?

242
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,678
- Yeah.
- I went to see his widow.

243
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,213
His files were doctored.

244
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,630
All of them were.

245
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,385
Why?

246
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:30,206
I don't know.

247
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,708
Kahani had everything.

248
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,761
He had everything on us.

249
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,287
Maybe Kahani wasn't Agency.

250
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,541
Maybe he was Tehran.

251
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,433
If that's true, then that means
the Iranians knew we were here.

252
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,307
Yeah, maybe they gave us the kill list.

253
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,951
Maybe we took out everyone
the regime wanted us to.

254
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,204
Uh, who's this?

255
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,038
Reza Esfahani.

256
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,975
He works at the Ministry of Defense.

257
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,732
He links everyone on the kill list.

258
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:28,687
I found a picture of him
in Ahmadi's apartment.

259
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:30,445
He's the one thing they have in common.

260
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,400
And you think he's the source
of the kill list?

261
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,880
Maybe.

262
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,614
Maybe he's on one end of these messages.

263
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:39,686
He gave the list to Kahani,

264
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,854
who passed it on to someone on our side.

265
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:47,746
Right.

266
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:53,572
Well, there's only one way to find out.

267
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:58,088
Okay, he's leaving.

268
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,922
- You see him?
- Got him.

269
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,184
Come on.

270
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:53,092
Now we find out who's on
the other end of those messages.

271
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,208
Salaam.

272
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,215
Got him?

273
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,675
We got him. He's back at work.

274
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,261
Anything useful?

275
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,122
Not yet.

276
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:10,614
We caught this on a home-security cam.

277
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,546
- We get a plate?
- We did.

278
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:14,045
Tracked the car all the way to here.

279
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,201
Two miles south of Epsom.

280
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:16,265
And then?

281
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,404
And then it disappears.

282
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:18,464
Maybe they switched cars.

283
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,191
Or changed plates.

284
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,709
What are they doing?

285
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:27,931
You can't do that. Hey!

286
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,396
I'm unarmed.

287
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:25,271
- Is he dead?
- He's dead,

288
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:26,932
but I didn't kill him.

289
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,206
He did it himself.

290
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,043
I don't believe you.

291
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,885
So don't believe me.

292
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,813
Look at me.

293
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,479
He came after my kids.

294
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,500
My children.

295
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:55,586
I mean, did you know about that?

296
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:58,917
Were you okay with that?

297
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:08,459
I saw them at The Section
removing the hard drives.

298
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:11,869
They looked like Agency.

299
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,007
They had that...

300
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:18,337
arrogance, you know.

301
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:22,859
Is this what you worked so hard for,

302
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,329
made all those sacrifices for...

303
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,089
to be their lapdogs?

304
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,286
Don't tell me it doesn't piss you off.

305
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:31,652
I saw you.

306
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:36,660
It's over, Elliot.

307
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:40,121
George knew it. You know it.

308
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,970
Were you the contact for that flight?

309
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:50,394
Was Ashkan Davoud on that plane?

310
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:53,690
I don't know.

311
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,518
Washington said they took him from Iran.

312
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:58,776
Was he here all along?

313
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,037
You know, right?

314
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:13,404
I arranged the pickup.

315
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,532
- That's all.
- From where?

316
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,224
From where?

317
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:22,526
147 Chartley Street.

318
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,543
Next to the railway.

319
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,600
Thank you.

320
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:56,838
Ah. Salaam alaikum.

321
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:58,656
<i>Wa alaikum as-salaam,</i> brother.
How can I help you?

322
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:01,305
Uh, I'm looking for a friend of mine...

323
00:28:01,392 --> 00:28:03,290
Ashkan Davoud. Do you know him?

324
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:05,592
- Sorry. No.
- Okay, thank you.

325
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:07,284
No problem.

326
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:15,387
All right, so, six hours out
from whatever the fuck.

327
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:16,622
Operation Green Light is,

328
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,250
and he's getting worked up
over stationery.

329
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:19,922
We need to light a fire.

330
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:12,958
We're on foot.

331
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,938
Be at the border in about five hours.

332
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,762
_

333
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:17,666
They're in position.

334
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,320
Tehran connection playing ball?

335
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,256
Like he was one of us.

336
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:23,538
Operation Green Light is all set.

337
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:29,562
What is it?

338
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,299
Surely there's another way.

339
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,193
We're sending them off into the desert

340
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,424
like goddamn heroes.

341
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,260
That's exactly what they are.

342
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,805
There's no other way
as effective as this.

343
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:42,204
This goes right to the gut.

344
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,534
We control the evidence.

345
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,027
We can make it say anything we want.

346
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,293
Evidence?

347
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:48,716
War is built on emotion.

348
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,185
You know that better than anyone.

349
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:54,703
Facts are white noise.

350
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,702
Hello, there. Sorry to interrupt.

351
00:31:08,673 --> 00:31:10,118
Do you know this man?

352
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:16,437
Please, he's in trouble.
I'm trying to help him.

353
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:21,274
You recognize him?

354
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,833
I've seen him.

355
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,233
He prays with Bijan.

356
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:29,723
Bijan. Bijan who?

357
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:31,293
Bijan Pouran.

358
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,193
Do you know where I can find him?

359
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,096
He lives on the Mozart Estate.

360
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:38,238
Okay, thank you.

361
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:44,928
Nice walk?

362
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:49,403
Where'd you go?

363
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,145
I've been in the archives.

364
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:53,248
You've been at the river.

365
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,015
We tracked your phone.

366
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,618
I don't have to answer to you.

367
00:31:57,753 --> 00:31:58,766
No. No, you don't.

368
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,659
Which is why I called
your chief's office.

369
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:07,801
That is what you call him, isn't it?

370
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,939
Your boss. The chief?

371
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,601
They're coming down to talk to you.

372
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,100
You do know the penalties

373
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,187
for passing on classified intelligence?

374
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:23,011
Maybe you and Snowden
can shack up in Moscow.

375
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:27,851
Now...

376
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,653
I'm gonna ask you this... just once.

377
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,521
What were you doing?

378
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:39,260
You know who Ashkam Davoud is?

379
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,861
<i>The whistle blower. Yeah. Why?</i>

380
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,379
Washington said they extracted
him from Iran, right?

381
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,685
- Right.<i> -What if I can
prove they were lying?</i>

382
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,860
<i>- Can you?</i>
- Not yet, but if I could?

383
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:50,390
Then I could run with that. Definitely.

384
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,234
Okay, thanks.

385
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,031
Bijan Pouran?

386
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,059
I'm not immigration.

387
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:13,818
Not police.

388
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:18,767
You can talk to me now,
or talk to them later.

389
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,339
Excuse me.

390
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:31,225
Sir, have you seen this man?

391
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,685
He was here, wasn't he?

392
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,203
Ashkam Davoud.

393
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:44,407
They took him from London, didn't they?

394
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:46,219
Not Iran.

395
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:49,329
You're not in trouble, Bijan.

396
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,599
I can help you.

397
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,508
I can get you money, papers.

398
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,938
Bijan...

399
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,508
I just need you to confirm that.

400
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,677
Then I can help you.

401
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,728
Yes, he was here.

402
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,211
Good.

403
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:13,947
Thank you.

404
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:17,717
It is? Uh... Oh. Sorry.

405
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:18,992
Hi?

406
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:20,968
Davoud was taken from London.

407
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,490
I've got the proof.

408
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:23,870
<i>I can bring it to you.</i>

409
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,342
Just meet me in the usual place.

410
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,493
<i>It hasn't been usual</i>

411
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,063
for over ten years.

412
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:53,321
You're telling me Max Easton

413
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,721
just disappeared?

414
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,391
Yes, sir.

415
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:59,686
You people are fucking amateurs.

416
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:12,272
Sorry, this just came in.

417
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:14,557
Thanks.

418
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,418
Shit.

419
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,240
What now?

420
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,235
- I think I might have something.
- Well?

421
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:30,575
Yesterday, Olivia Clarke
slipped her tail.

422
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,827
Max's ex-wife.

423
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,796
And why am I only
hearing about this now?

424
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,699
It wasn't processed correctly.

425
00:36:38,235 --> 00:36:39,400
Jesus.

426
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:42,415
This place really is
a finely-tuned machine.

427
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,202
Pull up her phone calls.

428
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:51,117
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:16,971
Atusa.

430
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,874
You don't call me.

431
00:37:20,273 --> 00:37:22,309
Our friend is dead.

432
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,112
<i>Are you there?</i>

433
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:27,807
<i>Was it you?</i>

434
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:29,384
Use your head.

435
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:30,979
Why would we do that?

436
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:35,560
<i>Are we still clear
on Operation Green Light?</i>

437
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,225
Yes.

438
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:38,945
Then we proceed.

439
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:41,542
<i>You don't ever call me again.</i>

440
00:37:44,284 --> 00:37:45,720
Get a voice trace.

441
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,161
Too faint.

442
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,511
But it was American... it must be
the other end of the chain.

443
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah, maybe, but it still
gives us nothing.

444
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:55,243
Yeah?

445
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:56,971
We have a problem.

446
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:00,113
We have a sandstorm incoming.

447
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,283
Going to make the landing site unsafe.

448
00:38:02,576 --> 00:38:03,685
How wide?

449
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:05,971
It's localized, about two klicks across.

450
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,251
Should we abort?

451
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,230
Recon gave us two possible
landing sites.

452
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,790
There's an area closer
to the power plant.

453
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:11,817
Greater risk.

454
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,227
And that airspace isn't cleared.

455
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:16,246
Leave that to me.

456
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,132
Now you're calling me?

457
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,026
<i>I have no choice. Our bridge is gone.</i>

458
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:34,175
We have a new landing site...

459
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:36,735
<i>32, 38, 50 North.</i>

460
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,118
<i>45, 25,</i>

461
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,987
22 East. Repeat.

462
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:43,057
<i>32, 38, 50 North.</i>

463
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,632
<i>45, 25, 22 East.</i>

464
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:49,755
0100. Confirm?

465
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,271
Confirmed.

466
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,670
Near the border, just
outside the town of Mehran.

467
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:04,965
What's that?

468
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,969
Some kind of installation.

469
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,755
- The Alin power plant.
- All right, let's go.

470
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:23,568
Hey.

471
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:37,310
He used to fly his kite here.

472
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:41,222
The yellow two-string with the red tail?

473
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:45,532
He spent hours flying that thing.

474
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:51,526
He was out here all winter
till his hands were numb.

475
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,727
You were right here.

476
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:55,430
The whole time.

477
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,564
Wouldn't let him out of your sight.

478
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:07,201
Where's this proof, then?

479
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:11,546
It's gone.

480
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:17,051
Every time I get a handle on this thing,

481
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:19,344
it just... it slips through my fingers.

482
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:21,875
Then why are you here?

483
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,396
Can you run the story?

484
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,786
Can you speak to your editor?
Would you do that for me?

485
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,002
I tried. I already spoke to him.

486
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:35,039
I told him I might have something.

487
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,100
He wants corroboration, Max.

488
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,855
He doesn't want alternative facts,

489
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,882
- he wants the good old-fashioned ones.
- When?

490
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:43,077
- When what?
- When did you speak to him?

491
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,245
Yesterday.

492
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,089
After you spoke to me?
After you left the house?

493
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:48,482
Yes.

494
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:51,152
Where, Liv? Where were you
when you spoke to him?

495
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:52,745
While I was driving away... Oh, my God.

496
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,871
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

497
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:57,705
Sir? We have it. She called her editor

498
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,980
three hours after she slipped the net.

499
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,455
<i>Hi, Angus, it's Olivia.</i>

500
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,333
<i>I've got something. Can I come in?</i>

501
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,943
"'I don't much care where, ' said Alice.

502
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:10,848
'Then it doesn't matter which
way you go.' said the Cat."

503
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,673
"'So long as I get somewhere.'"

504
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,030
- Where was she?
- Right here.

505
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,689
Five miles from where the car was found.

506
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:23,450
- Get a team down there.
- Yes, sir.

507
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:25,765
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

508
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,821
The garden of England.

509
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:55,803
<i>Attendez.</i>

510
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,940
<i>Where are you? Why
didn't you answer the phone?</i>

511
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:05,460
I was putting the children to bed.

512
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:07,620
<i>You need to take the girls, you
need to get out of there now.</i>

513
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:09,309
- Max.<i>
- I'm on my way.</i>

514
00:42:09,374 --> 00:42:11,042
<i>Go to the woods behind the house,</i>

515
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:14,733
<i>Head south. Anna.</i>

516
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,608
- Someone's here.<i>
- Go.</i>

517
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:17,784
Someone's here.

518
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,163
<i>Go. Go, now!</i>

519
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:55,732
<i>- Non! Mama!</i>
- Shh!

520
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:38,639
No!

521
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,618
Please, please.

522
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:45,105
Please.

523
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,788
Give me the gun.

524
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,983
- I can't.
- Anna.

525
00:45:42,683 --> 00:45:44,152
We have to go.

526
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:47,047
- We have to get going.
- I... I can't.

527
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,449
I can't do it.

528
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:50,044
You can.

529
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:53,532
Anna, now.

530
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,764
Understand? We have to go.

531
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:59,093
Chloe, come on.

532
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,984
Come on.

533
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:27,687
All right, this'll do.

534
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:44,327
Okay, change into your uniforms.

535
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:15,175
The coordinates are right down there.

536
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:03,297
Okay, you got five minutes.

537
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:05,986
Prelims here.

538
00:48:06,307 --> 00:48:09,223
We'll take the rest
of the material to the lab.

539
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:54,949
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking ambush.

540
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:06,606
Get us back online, now!

541
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,603
All right.

542
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:39,322
Let's move out.

543
00:49:40,848 --> 00:49:42,543
He's American.

544
00:49:44,157 --> 00:49:45,796
He's American.

545
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:50,851
Who were those people?

546
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,451
What the fuck just happened?

547
00:49:58,946 --> 00:50:00,714
Quds Force.

548
00:50:02,009 --> 00:50:04,379
Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

549
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:54,946
<i>U.S. Forces were fired upon</i>

550
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:57,470
<i>by members of the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</i>

551
00:50:57,495 --> 00:51:00,040
<i>We can now confirm
none of our brave men and women</i>

552
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,724
<i>have survived what appears to be</i>

553
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:03,015
<i>an ambush by Iranian forces.</i>

554
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,419
<i>They were apparently escorting</i>

555
00:51:04,443 --> 00:51:05,844
<i>a group of international scientists</i>

556
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:07,761
<i>who were there to verify whether Tehran</i>

557
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:09,489
<i>is in breach of the nuclear deal.</i>

558
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,184
<i>I want to be very clear about this.</i>

559
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:21,648
<i>Major Jordan Franklin
is a goddamn American hero.</i>

560
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:24,027
<i>This cannot be allowed to stand.</i>

561
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:27,006
<i>This cannot be allowed to go unanswered.</i>

562
00:51:27,227 --> 00:51:28,495
<i>We have to respond.</i>

563
00:51:28,816 --> 00:51:30,151
<i>A military response?</i>

564
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:31,421
<i>If necessary, yes.</i>

565
00:51:31,446 --> 00:51:33,476
<i>Even if that means war?</i>

566
00:51:35,641 --> 00:51:37,800
<i>Even if that means war.</i>
