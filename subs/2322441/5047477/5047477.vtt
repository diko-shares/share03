00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.658
<i>Ana, take my car.</i>

2
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.247
I gave you the recorder,
right?

3
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:42.871
Oh, yes.

4
00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.831
And you have
all the questions?

5
00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:45.882
Yes.

6
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:46.958
And you know
where you're going?

7
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.589
Yes, I do have a GPS.

8
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.262
And a 4.0 GPA.

9
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.797
I can figure it out.

10
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:52.923
Are you wearing that?

11
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.928
Okay, maybe a little
less talking,

12
00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.596
more eating.

13
00:02:58.762 --> 00:02:59.854
How about that?

14
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.868
Wow.

15
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:48.937
Miss Kavanagh?

16
00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.112
May I take your coat?

17
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:53.651
Oh. Yeah. Um...

18
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.366
She's...
Okay, so...

19
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.038
Mr. Grey will see you now.

20
00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.410
Okay.

21
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.706
This way, please.

22
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.587
Okay- RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Grey has
a conference call at 11 :15.

23
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.171
Right this way.

24
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.354
Miss Kavanagh.

25
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.728
Are you all right?

26
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.816
Christian Grey.

27
00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.526
I'm Anastasia Steele.

28
00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:37.032
Um, Miss Kavanagh has the flu,
so she asked me to fill in.

29
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:38.320
I see.

30
00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.947
So, you're studying
journalism <i>as</i> well.

31
00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.374
No, English Lit.

32
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:43.617
Urn...

33
00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.160
Kate's my roommate.

34
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:47.541
As I said,
I only have 10 minutes.

35
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.206
Please, have a seat,
Miss Steele.

36
00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.765
Okay.

37
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:17.113
Thank you.

38
00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.113
Ready?

39
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:24.699
Whenever you are.

40
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.956
Okay. Urn...

41
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.333
So, this is for the special
graduation issue

42
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.413
of the student newspaper.

43
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.800
Yes, I'm giving the commencement
address at this year's ceremony.

44
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:34.922
You are?

45
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:37.970
Imean, urn...

46
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.633
I know.

47
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.973
<i>Uh...</i> "You are very young to
have amassed such an empire.

48
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.056
"To what do you owe your..."

49
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.062
To what do I owe
my success?

50
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.485
Yep.

51
00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:53.983
Seriously?

52
00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.442
Yes.

53
00:05:57.816 --> 00:05:59.068
Business is about people.

54
00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.742
And I've always
been good at people.

55
00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.491
What motivates them,
what incentivizes them,

56
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.125
what inspires them.

57
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.587
Um, maybe you're
just lucky.

58
00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:15.376
I've always found
that the harder I work,

59
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.506
the more luck
I seem to have.

60
00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.264
The key to my success has been in
identifying talented individuals

61
00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.596
and harnessing
their efforts.

62
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:25.135
So, you're a control freak?

63
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.772
Oh, I exercise control in
all things, Miss Steele.

64
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:33.318
Okay. Urn...

65
00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.068
"Your company is
involved primarily

66
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.445
"in the telecommunications
sector,

67
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.278
"yet you also invest in
numerous agricultural projects,

68
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.697
"including several in Africa.

69
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.998
"Is that something that you
feel passionate about?

70
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.038
"Feeding the world's poor?"

71
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.747
It's smart business.

72
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.172
You don't agree?

73
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.509
I don't know
enough about it.

74
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.304
I just wonder if

75
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:09.138
perhaps your heart might be a bit
bigger than you want to let on?

76
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.351
There are some people who say
that I don't have a heart at all.

77
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.064
Why would they say that?

78
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.899
Because they know me well.

79
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:20.482
Go on.

80
00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:25.032
Um... "Do you have any
interests outside of work?"

81
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.373
I enjoy various
physical pursuits.

82
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.158
You're unmarried.

83
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.242
Oh.

84
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.207
You were adopted at age four.

85
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.038
That's a matter
of public record.

86
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.587
I'm sorry, I didn't...

87
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.550
Do you have an actual
question, Miss Steele?

88
00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.048
Yeah, sorry.

89
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.889
"Are you gay?"

90
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.066
It's written here,
I'm just...

91
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.395
No, Anastasia.

92
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.608
I'm not gay.

93
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.408
I apologize, Mr. Grey.
Kate can be a little...

94
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.567
Intrusive?

95
00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:07.946
Curious.

96
00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.037
What about you?

97
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.919
Why don't you ask me something
that you want to know?

98
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.801
Earlier, you said that there are
some people who know you well.

99
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.973
Why do I get the feeling
that, that is not true?

100
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.902
Mr. Grey, your next meeting
is in the conference room.

101
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.029
Cancel, please.
We're not finished here.

102
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.398
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.112
No... I'm...

104
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.618
I can go. It's fine.

105
00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.778
I would like to
know more about you.

106
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.616
There's really not much
to know about me.

107
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.960
You said you're
an English major?

108
00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.376
Tell me,
was it Charlotte BrontÃ©,

109
00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.798
Jane Austen,
or Thomas Hardy

110
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:03.085
who first made you
faHinlove with literature?

111
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:05.962
Hardy.

112
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.467
I would have guessed
Jane Austen.

113
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.979
What are your plans
after you graduate?

114
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.482
I'm just trying to
get through finals right now.

115
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.566
And then?

116
00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.986
And then I was planning
on moving here, to Seattle,

117
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.488
with Kate.

118
00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.865
We offer an excellent
internship program.

119
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.445
I don't think
I'd fit in here.

120
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.168
Look at me.

121
00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:40.505
I am.

122
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.712
I hope you got
everything you needed.

123
00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.845
I... I think you only
answered four questions.

124
00:09:58.473 --> 00:09:59.816
Anastasia.

125
00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.560
Christian.

126
00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.075
Holy cow.

127
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.046
Urn...

128
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.131
Before you say anything...

129
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.765
You're a goddess.
This is perfect.

130
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:33.933
What?

131
00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:37.266
I just got his e-mail.
He answered every question.

132
00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.019
So, what was he like?

133
00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.099
Urn...

134
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:44.435
He was fine.

135
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.151
"Fine"?

136
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:48.898
Just fine?

137
00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:52.952
Um, he was really polite,

138
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.456
and he was courteous,

139
00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.285
and very formal,

140
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.621
and clean.

141
00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.376
"Clean"?

142
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.136
I mean, he was very smart.

143
00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.639
And intense.

144
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.304
It was kind of intimidating.

145
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.511
I can understand
the fascination.

146
00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:19.596
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.603
Why are you
looking at me like that?

148
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.396
Like what?

149
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.152
Okay.

150
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.484
I'm gonna make a sandwich.
Do you want one?

151
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:30.773
No, thanks.

152
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:38.915
You have to admit,
he's ridiculously hot.

153
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.916
I'm sure if you

154
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:47.625
are attracted to that
sort of human, then...

155
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.836
The hot type of human?

156
00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:54.343
I asked him if he was gay.
That was in your questions.

157
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:55.631
Why would you
do that to me?

158
00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:57.926
Because whenever he's
in the society pages,

159
00:11:58.092 --> 00:12:00.766
he's never been photographed
with a woman- So, naturally...

160
00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.307
Well, maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private, Kate.

161
00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.316
And now you're defending him.

162
00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:07.936
I'm terminating
this conversation.

163
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.481
Too bad we don't have
some original stills

164
00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:15.448
of your hot, clean
27-year-old billionaire.

165
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.157
The camera loves him
almost as much as you do.

166
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.283
Okay, I wasn't hungry,
but now I am.

167
00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:23.789
Thank you.

168
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.621
I love you.

169
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.144
"I declared
I could not change,

170
00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.976
"yet you tell me to my face

171
00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.232
"I shall change soon.

172
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.282
"And what a distortion
in yourjudgment,

173
00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:57.531
"what a perversity
in your ideas..."

174
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:10.999
Ana. I've been looking for you.
What's up?

175
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.174
Guess what.
What?

176
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.005
Portland Place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.

177
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.013
Oh, my God.

178
00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.550
Congratulations!
That's so good!

179
00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.219
Solo show, corazÃ©n.

180
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.058
Can we celebrate later? Because
I'm really late for work.

181
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.893
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got it.
But, um...

182
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:27.895
Hold on.

183
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.851
Thank you.

184
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:31.603
You're my hero.

185
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:32.653
I'll see you later.

186
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.730
ANASTASIAI Okay.

187
00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.786
Mom, I'm at work.
Can I call you back?

188
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.871
<i>Oh, no, wait.
I called for</i> a <i>reason.</i>

189
00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:48.457
<i>Bob broke his foot playing
golf, of all things.</i>

190
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.917
God. Is he okay?
Is he in a lot of pain?

191
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.081
Who can tell with the man?

192
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.712
He calls the paramedics
for a blister.

193
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:57.925
<i>It means, though, we won't be
able to fly in for graduation.</i>

194
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.556
Really?

195
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.136
You don't wanna just come alone?
You don't have to bring Bob.

196
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.850
Ah. And leave Tiger Woods
to fend for himself?

197
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.398
<i>You do understand.
Don't you, darling?</i>

198
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.776
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

199
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.104
Um, I really
have to go, okay?

200
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.396
<i>I love you, Ana.</i>

201
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.156
I know. I love you, too.

202
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.442
Oh, God.

203
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.610
Ana.

204
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:22.991
Could you give me
a hand out back?

205
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.122
Uh, yeah.
I'll be right there.

206
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.209
I thought it was you.

207
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.843
What the...

208
00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:39.970
What a pleasant surprise,
Miss Steele.

209
00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.590
Just "Ana."

210
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:43.925
Just "Ana."

211
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.093
You're in here.

212
00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.261
I was in the area
on business.

213
00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:48.813
I needed to pick
up a few things.

214
00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:50.314
Are you free?

215
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.316
Yeah.

216
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.602
What can I help you with?

217
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.821
Do you stock cable ties?

218
00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.114
Cable ties, yes. We do.

219
00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.488
I can show you,
if you want.

220
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.987
Please lead the way,
Miss Steele.

221
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:05.864
Just "Ana."

222
00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.336
Is that it?

223
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.872
Masking tape.

224
00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.999
Are you redecorating?

225
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.667
No.

226
00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:22.214
Um, we have two-inch
and one-inch.

227
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.508
But the truly
self-respecting handyman

228
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.467
will have both
in his toolbox.

229
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:27.844
Of course he will.
Mmm-hmm.

230
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.521
It's rare to find
a connoisseur these days.

231
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.850
Do you want anything else?

232
00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:35.519
Yes.

233
00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.729
Rope.

234
00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.654
That's impressive.

235
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.026
Are you a Girl Scout?

236
00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.284
Urn, no.

237
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.997
Organized group activities
aren't really my thing.

238
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.495
So what is your "thing"?

239
00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.663
Urn...

240
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.091
I don't know. Books?

241
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:00.543
Okay.

242
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.055
Rope, tape, cable ties.

243
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.553
You're the complete
serial killer.

244
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:08.684
Not today.

245
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.932
Anything else?

246
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.688
What would you recommend?

247
00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.562
For a do-it-yourself er?
Um...

248
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.279
Maybe coveralls,
so you protect your clothes.

249
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.064
I could just take
all my clothes off.

250
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.400
Okay.

251
00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:25.568
No clothes.

252
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.153
I mean, no coveralls.

253
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:31.240
I can't think
of anything else.

254
00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.911
Well, I guess
that's it, then.

255
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.291
Cool.

256
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.879
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions, by the way.

257
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.042
She was thrilled.

258
00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.256
I hope she's feeling better.

259
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.419
She is, yeah, much.

260
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.926
She's just having a hard time
clearing a photo of you, I think.

261
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.758
If she'd like an original,
I'm around tomorrow.

262
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.764
You'd be willing
to do that?

263
00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.182
Yeah.

264
00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.558
Want me to bag
for you, Ana?

265
00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.107
Oh. Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks, though, Paul.

266
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:59.652
Okay.

267
00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.451
I'm staying
locally at the Heathman.

268
00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:08.869
Call me before 10:00.

269
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.039
About the photos.

270
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.366
Oh.

271
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:14.951
Yeah, I will.

272
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.130
EnJOY your...

273
00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:40.814
Thanks again
for doing this, Mr. Grey.

274
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.229
I'm happy to help.

275
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.190
Uh, how about we try
a few with a smile?

276
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.153
Or not.

277
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.040
You do realize that
he hasn't stopped looking at you.

278
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:59.044
He asked me
to go for coffee afterwards.

279
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:00.955
What?

280
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:02.673
Kate, shh.

281
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.842
So, is he your boyfriend?

282
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:07.503
Who?

283
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.047
The photographer.

284
00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.011
JosÃ©?

285
00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.345
No.

286
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:14.510
I saw the way
he was smiling at you.

287
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:17.396
No, JosÃ© is
more like family.

288
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.182
He's not my boyfriend.

289
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.021
And the guy at the store?

290
00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.064
Paul?

291
00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.691
No.

292
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.321
Thank you.

293
00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:43.877
You seem nervous.

294
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.713
I find you intimidating.

295
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.379
You should.

296
00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:52.632
Eat.

297
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.892
Not to mention high-handed.

298
00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:57.595
I'm used to
getting my own way.

299
00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.605
That must get very boring.

300
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.727
Tell me about your family.

301
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.487
My family? Um...

302
00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.738
Okay.

303
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.275
My dad died
when I was a baby.

304
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.490
So, I was raised by
my stepfather, Ray.

305
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:15.579
He's amazing.

306
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.415
And your mother?

307
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:22.128
Um, my mother is on
husband number four.

308
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.002
She's an incurable romantic.

309
00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:27.958
Are you?

310
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.468
Am I a romantic?

311
00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.968
Well, I study English Lit.

312
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.007
So, I kind of have to be.

313
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.142
I thought the photo
shoot went well. Right?

314
00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.305
Kate seems to be really...

315
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.600
I'm sorry, I can't...

316
00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.184
What?

317
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:46.769
I'll walk you out.

318
00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:53.863
Do you have a girlfriend?
Is that it?

319
00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:56.199
I don't do the girlfriend thing.

320
00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.370
What does that even...
Watch it!

321
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.132
I'm not the man for you.

322
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.465
You should
steer clear of me.

323
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.802
I have to let you go.

324
00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.817
Goodbye, Mr. Grey.

325
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.823
All right, pencils down.

326
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.993
Please take your final exams
to the back of the classroom.

327
00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.904
Final grades will be
posted in two weeks.

328
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:40.740
Hey. You all good?

329
00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:43.542
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

330
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:45.624
We are so partying tonight.

331
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.250
on, my God.

332
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.672
This is way too much.

333
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:51.092
No, this is exactly
the right amount.

334
00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.760
You're getting it
all over my face.

335
00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:54.178
That's the idea.

336
00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.597
Wow. No, Kate.

337
00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.175
Cab's early. Let's go.

338
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.686
Ana,
it's a package for you.

339
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08,01
