1
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:23,454
A longtime

2
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,338
D-ball tradition returns

3
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:28,341
as the Millers
defend their title

4
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:29,677
against the Worthingtons.

5
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,007
How you doing? You ready?

6
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:33,914
Yeah.

7
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:46,360
<i>This is donkey ball, or D-ball</i>

8
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:47,861
<i>for those in the know.</i>

9
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:59,907
<i>It's kind of like basketball,</i>
<i>except for...</i>

10
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,993
<i>well, the whole donkey thing.</i>

11
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,936
<i>My family's real good</i>
<i>at D-ball.</i>

12
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,473
<i>It's important</i>
<i>for families to have something.</i>

13
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,708
All right!

14
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:20,577
<i>Even if it's just donkey ball.</i>

15
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,980
<i>And even if it just happens</i>
<i>once a year--</i>

16
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,098
<i>the day after</i> <i>Thanksgiving.</i>

17
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,332
What a pass by Frank to Kenny.

18
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,921
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

19
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,757
<i>We're not even</i>
<i>at Thanksgiving yet.</i>

20
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,585
<i>I left home three years ago,</i>

21
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:49,272
<i>and I didn't exactly have</i>
<i>my father's blessing.</i>

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,543
<i>All my father knows is</i>
<i>his son ditched him</i>

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,812
<i>and the family business.</i>

24
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,750
<i>I left to find my own way</i>

25
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:03,487
<i>and ended up writing a book</i>
<i>few people care about.</i>

26
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,022
<i>But I don't mind.</i>

27
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,541
<i>I made something.</i>

28
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,082
<i>I feel like a little kid</i>
<i>coming home</i>

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,334
<i>with a finger painting</i>
<i>to show my mom.</i>

30
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,487
<i>She'd put it on the fridge</i>
<i>until my dad took it down.</i>

31
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,056
<i>And that would be that.</i>

32
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,185
Where's Dad?

33
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:37,654
What? I'm not good enough?

34
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,356
What, did you
just wake up?

35
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:40,691
Yeah, I did.

36
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,359
You're late.
- I know.

37
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,127
Welcome home, bro.

38
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:46,630
Good to see you.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,468
# And I'm collecting
on the rent #

40
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,136
# <i>Daddy's home</i> #

41
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,806
# But you don't expect
a small school tale. Huh? #

42
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,674
# And I'm collecting
on the rent... #

43
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,163
# Are you done with that image
yet, rent's due... #

44
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,464
So where's Dad?

45
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,832
His old dog had
another stroke,

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
and he didn't want
to leave him alone.

47
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:09,920
It's funny. He's got
more tumors than brains,

48
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,022
but he just keeps
getting up and around.

49
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,424
I'm only hearing
about this now because?

50
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,858
Probably afraid you'd bail.

51
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,660
I mean, it's been four years after all.
- Three.

52
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:20,113
Three years.
- Whatever.

53
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:23,066
Well...

54
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:26,369
my masterpiece.

55
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,454
Hmm.

56
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,990
Think I'll wait for the movie.

57
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,960
So I have this idea.
Do you want to hear it?

58
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,096
Not really.
- Yeah, you do.

59
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,031
Okay, so we should
do a lottery.

60
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,332
We should draw names

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,668
to see who we're going to
spend Thanksgiving with.

62
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,271
Maybe even take preferences,
like smoking or non.

63
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:47,507
I mean, no grudges,
no history, no baggage.

64
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:51,811
Just food, football, and good,
old-fashioned false camaraderie.

65
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:55,648
We had a good ride as...

66
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:56,884
as kids?

67
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,685
Would you say that...

68
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:02,055
we had a happy childhood?

69
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:05,008
Brian Worthington,
are you in therapy?

70
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:29,800
We're not leaving until
you put it on and buckle it.

71
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:30,883
Mom, it's a Volvo.

72
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:32,836
I can wait.
I've got all day.

73
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,745
I am so humiliated.

74
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:43,680
What you are is safe.

75
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,867
This is just a wild guess,

76
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,504
but I think you might
have left the lights on.

77
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,992
Okay.

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,261
Frito-Lay it is.

79
00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,896
Going in the big truck.

80
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,304
Oh.

81
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,909
I thought this would be
a nice one to start with.

82
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,244
Oh.

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,548
Oh. You've been married
for 30...?

84
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:37,550
34 this year.

85
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:40,086
Oh.

86
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,494
Where's Grandpa?

87
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:52,165
He's in his workshop, honey,
making some contraption.

88
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,368
Disappeared as soon
as the photos came out.

89
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,102
Grandpa?

90
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,437
Hey, you.

91
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:14,904
Did you ever hear of knocking?

92
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,340
It's a barn, Grandpa.

93
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,124
Yeah. Well, I guess
you were born in a barn.

94
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:19,509
Go close the door.

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,601
What's that for?

96
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,805
It's Grandpa's
little helper.

97
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:33,506
Hey, get out of here.

98
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:35,441
Go watch TV, huh?

99
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,711
Out of here.

100
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,112
I got you.

101
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:45,552
I got to stop and take a piss.

102
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:46,753
We're almost home.

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,088
Mom's gonna do
that whole thing

104
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:49,739
by the door, and
I can't hold it.

105
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,442
# Give me that back, huh?
Yeah... #

106
00:06:57,031 --> 00:07:00,433
Damn. It's the Worthington boys.

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,102
What's up, man?

108
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,003
How you doing?
- I'm gonna hit the can.

109
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:05,839
Go ahead.
- Hey, Walker.

110
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:07,841
Four years, ain't it?

111
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:11,611
Uh... three years.

112
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,846
Well, I ain't the sharpest

113
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:14,447
saw on the rack,
but I make it four.

114
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,550
You boys are ready
for some serious D-Ball?

115
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,918
Yeah.
- Yeah?

116
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:21,020
Yeah. We could
play you guys.

117
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:24,423
Hey, big-time
author now, huh?

118
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:25,992
Geek books.

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,494
What, there are,
like, midgets in them?

120
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,399
God, I miss this place.

121
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,968
Take it easy.

122
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,502
Take it easy.

123
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,767
What's this?

124
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,919
Oh, honey.

125
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:55,322
Let me just keep one of them.
You look

126
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,490
so pretty in it.

127
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,393
There.

128
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:03,529
Well, now
you've ripped your arm off.

129
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,039
Is this...?

130
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,541
Oh, here they are!
- Mom.

131
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:15,875
Hey, Ma.
- Hi.

132
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,577
Oh, my gracious.

133
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:19,446
Oh, my goodness,
is it you?

134
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:20,747
Yes.

135
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,615
Oh, look at your hair.
It's... Mmm!

136
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:24,016
You look so handsome.

137
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,853
Look at you.
Oh, my goodness.

138
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,221
Whatever.
- Okay, what can I do for you?

139
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,723
Nothing.
- You-You want me to stack?

140
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,290
No.
- Let me have your bag.

141
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,992
No, I got it.
- Why don't you leave it here, honey?

142
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,394
'Cause you're gonna
take it right upstairs.

143
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,928
I have something I want
to keep there, and so...

144
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,464
Okay. All right.
Straight ahead.

145
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,884
What's up, sis?

146
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,986
Oh. Who is
your friend?

147
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,554
Hitchhiker.

148
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:46,522
Come on. It hasn't
been that long.

149
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,157
Sit down, honey.

150
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,993
Ta-da!

151
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,661
Nice... cover.

152
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,329
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:54,297
What is this?

154
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,917
It's the dreaded
family photo album.

155
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,686
A disturbing documentary
years in the making.

156
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:00,920
Here you are.

157
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:03,423
I can't believe
what a dork I was.

158
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:04,758
Uh-oh.

159
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,676
Revenge of the conehead.

160
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,111
Hey!
- Oh! - Oh!

161
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,514
Buddy.
- Oh, my little...

162
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,099
I thought you said the skin
problem cleared up, Mom.

163
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,503
Well, Dr. Morrow said we could
take it off at our discretion.

164
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,388
Doing a little
revisionist history, Erin?

165
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:20,690
Yes, sweetheart.
Do you want to come in

166
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,058
and say hi
to your uncles?

167
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,994
Guess that would make you
the mom.

168
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,728
Well, you did marry a dog.

169
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:29,299
Excuse me?

170
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,702
What?

171
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,872
I got to get going.

172
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,239
I should get Maddy. I...

173
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,091
No, no, no, no, no.
I just got here. What?

174
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,627
It's fine. I need to get going.
- What happened?

175
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,812
I didn't do anything.
- No. It's fine.

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,213
Oh, honey, don't.

177
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,516
Thank you for
the book, Brian.

178
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,019
Hey.

179
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,011
We're going.

180
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,651
See you at dinner.

181
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,376
Autographed copy.

182
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,744
Is this mine?

183
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,112
Mm-hmm.

184
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,615
Oh, honey, I didn't
get you anything.

185
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:24,087
<i>Adventures in the</i>
<i>Electromagnetic...</i>

186
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,888
<i>Spectrum.</i>
<i>- Spectrum.</i>

187
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:28,091
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:30,760
I'll certainly...
have a look at this.

189
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,696
It's okay, Mom.

190
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,731
I don't expect you
to read it.

191
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:36,233
Or anyone else
for that matter.

192
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,935
Oh, of course
they will.

193
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,590
What you working on?

194
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,093
Nothing much.

195
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:09,366
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

196
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,402
I'm...

197
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,872
I'm between projects
right now, so...

198
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,691
Uh-huh, right.

199
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,087
Oh, man, did you catch
the Redskins game last week?

200
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:34,123
Somebody's gotta mind the shop,
you know.

201
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,176
We don't have
the kind of help

202
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:39,512
we used to.

203
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:47,137
Dad, I just wanted
to say hi,

204
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,488
so...

205
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,822
So what...

206
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,158
what you got there?

207
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,599
Nothing much.

208
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,025
When, um, when are we
going to take Brian

209
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:27,994
to see Aunt Sharon?

210
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,195
Yeah.

211
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,297
Oh, honey,
let's not bother.

212
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,700
Aren't we going
to see her on Friday?

213
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,670
I think flowers are perfect
for any occasion, don't you?

214
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,239
What, is she sick?

215
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,107
She wasn't really
your aunt, you know.

216
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,475
What?
Tonight,

217
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,010
on <i>Worthington Family Secrets,</i>
we discover

218
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:45,344
that Aunt Sharon
wasn't exactly

219
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,113
who we thought
she was.

220
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,314
<i>Was?</i>

221
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,817
Are we here
to eat or talk?

222
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,285
I'm thinking daisies.

223
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,853
Is she dead?
- Aunt Sharon died?

224
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,521
It's not like we saw her

225
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,991
all the time.
- Guess we're not going to see her

226
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,926
on Friday.
- Was there

227
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,261
a funeral?
- Oh, let's not talk

228
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,996
about something so morbid.

229
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:04,597
What's everybody having?

230
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,766
Uh, prime ribs look pretty good.
I'm thinking

231
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,701
maybe the scallops.
- What is wrong

232
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,470
with this family?
- I've compiled a list,

233
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:13,807
and let me tell you, things
aren't looking too good for you.

234
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,474
I have an idea.

235
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,111
Let's play "What's Kenny going
to be when he grows up?"

236
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:20,313
Can I play?

237
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,081
Not helping.
- Whatever.

238
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,051
Have you heard from <i>National</i>
<i>Geographic</i> Magazine yet,

239
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,386
Mr. "Photojournalist"?

240
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:28,387
Yeah.

241
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,889
They want the story
on Maddy.

242
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,292
In our bonus round
of <i>Worthington Family Secrets,</i>

243
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,860
we reveal to Maddy

244
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:37,063
that at birth she had a heart
transplant... from a baboon.

245
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,264
Well...

246
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,200
I guess it explains a lot.

247
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:41,567
Don't worry, angel.

248
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:44,570
Uncle Kenny was just
having a little fun.

249
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,306
Care for a mint?
- Why don't you go get

250
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,708
Mommy a mint?

251
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,445
You little shit.

252
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,547
You have no idea
how seriously

253
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,515
they take things like that.

254
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,217
Oh, honey...

255
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:59,219
please don't.

256
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,554
Let her go.
Let her go, Dottie.

257
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,891
Roll?

258
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:11,680
What?

259
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,004
Stupid Kenny.
Why do I do anything

260
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,423
for this family?

261
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:24,127
I hate Thanksgiving.

262
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,367
Fine, just get it
out of my sight.

263
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,602
Keep it in your room.

264
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,779
Where's the bird?

265
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:45,348
Erin's holding us hostage
with the divorce.

266
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,983
She says if we don't have
Thanksgiving

267
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,284
at her place this year,

268
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,620
Maddy's going to wind up
in therapy.

269
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,690
Two.

270
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,860
Like she has a chance
of avoiding that.

271
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,869
Does it help?

272
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,104
What?

273
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,455
Therapy.

274
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,290
I'm not in therapy.

275
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,742
Shh.

276
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,276
Hear that?

277
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,346
It's him.

278
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,965
The ghost of
Thanksgiving past.

279
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:21,167
What's he doing up?

280
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,301
Didn't he just
have a stroke?

281
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:23,502
Yeah, he did have
a stroke,

282
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,672
but I think it just
slurred his barking.

283
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:30,643
You know, maybe I should talk
to Dad about having him...

284
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,177
put down.

285
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,563
You know what we should do?

286
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,267
We should hire a hit man to take
out Argus and Erin's cat.

287
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,836
Get some sort
of two-for-one deal.

288
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,538
You know,
you should do something.

289
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:43,906
Seriously, you should.

290
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,692
Yeah, but when I said "we,"
I meant "you."

291
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,077
Hey,

292
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,512
it's not my fault

293
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,146
that you're the only grown-up
in this family.

294
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:52,648
Maybe you should...

295
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,550
grow up.

296
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:58,471
Well, you know, Brian,
I tried to grow up, but I can't.

297
00:15:58,538 --> 00:16:00,473
It's like being disabled.

298
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,791
How did he get in here?
Uh, well, he just, um...

299
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,994
He walked in.

300
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,379
By himself.

301
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:10,215
Hmm, we just
can't keep him down.

302
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:11,917
Brian, would you
please take him out?

303
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,772
Did you hear that, Brian?

304
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,842
The nice lady asked you
to take him out.

305
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,111
Take him out, Brian.

306
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,380
Take him out.

307
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,352
You have
to hold him?

308
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:30,719
Yeah, you have to.

309
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:32,654
Otherwise he'll piss
all over himself.

310
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:34,757
And how did
they come up with this?

311
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,075
Well, Dad tried

312
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:40,279
holding him by the back legs,
but he tweaked his back.

313
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,882
But... not our problem, right?

314
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,711
Brian.

315
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:14,680
Shit.

316
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,599
Kenny, what are you doing?

317
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,302
Me?
What the hell are you doing?

318
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,271
Just...

319
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:25,040
Do you think it's weird
that Dad has an empty fish tank?

320
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,342
Shh, shh, shh.

321
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,210
What is it?

322
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,947
I don't think he's breathing.

323
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,933
Oh, shit.

324
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,486
They'll think I had something
to do with it.

325
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,289
Reboot.

326
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,226
He's all right.

327
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,794
Hey, buddy.

328
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,597
Could you do it?

329
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,733
Do what?
- Ice the dog.

330
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:54,353
I mean, if you were guaranteed
that nobody would ever find out.

331
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,294
I don't know.

332
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,396
Maybe I'll talk to Dad.

333
00:18:04,464 --> 00:18:06,715
Thanks for the warning.

334
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:13,705
MAN
It's a beautiful Turkey Day.

335
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,441
Get those birds in the oven.

336
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,643
This is WSTKW--
Staunton, Virginia--

337
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,545
bringing you all the news,
sports, and weather.

338
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,532
And now, news on the hour.

339
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,534
At the Tri-County Fair...

340
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,586
Come on, come on, come on.

341
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:28,787
So bring the whole family out

342
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,957
and enjoy
the great fall weather.

343
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,691
Tomorrow night,
Jimmy-o takes the stage.

344
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,493
You'll want
to put on your dan...

345
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,361
Take it easy.

346
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,814
Yeah, easy, easy, easy.

347
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:44,554
You'd better watch your fingers, Dad.

348
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,639
He'd never hurt a fly.

349
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,224
If you were
around more,

350
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,326
you'd know what they call him
down at the vet's office.

351
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,194
Mm... the old...
- The old

352
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,064
gentleman.

353
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,602
So can I take your car?

354
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,136
I forgot razor blades.

355
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:03,756
Well, use Kenny's.
- Mom said he went out.

356
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,141
You probably don't remember

357
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,526
how to get there.

358
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:10,780
Yeah, yeah, I've only been
going there my whole life.

359
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:13,449
No, really, uh,
I'll have to show you

360
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:15,034
how to use the new alarm
I put on.

361
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,235
Dad.

362
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:19,522
I'm a technical writer.

363
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:22,458
I think I can figure out
the car alarm.

364
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,627
Good boy.

365
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:28,013
Mm-hmm.

366
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,975
Morning, Mom.

367
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,577
Morning.

368
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:25,454
Oh, God.

369
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,232
I'll get it.

370
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,701
I said...
- Oh, Frank.

371
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,335
Aah, damn.
- Why don't you just let me get it?

372
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,537
I said I'd get it.

373
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:42,972
I... hello.

374
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,306
Ma, you got to help.

375
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:45,908
I threw Thanksgiving dinner
in the dumpster.

376
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:46,909
What?

377
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,211
I have nothing to cook for us.

378
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,315
Hi.

379
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:14,920
Razor blades
and sleeping pills.

380
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:16,355
It can't be that bad.

381
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:18,857
You don't know my family.

382
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,425
I bet they shop here,

383
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,911
and I bet
I can tell you things

384
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,746
about them
you don't even know.

385
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:28,183
Well... that wouldn't be
too hard.

386
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:33,272
So, uh, what
do I owe you?

387
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,258
Uh, $9.75,

388
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,194
please.

389
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,397
Well, you guys are going to have
Thanksgiving dinner, right?

390
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:43,849
That'll be nice.

391
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,300
And I bet
it's a home-cooked meal

392
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,603
and not some turkey in a box
or something.

393
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,841
I'm out of quarters.

394
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:53,943
Oh... keep the change.
I got to go.

395
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,011
I borrowed my dad's
car, and he can be

396
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,398
kind of tense
about things like that.

397
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,401
Right.

398
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,289
Is it the one
with the lights flashing?

399
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:09,124
Huh?
- The lights.

400
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:11,477
Oh, shit!

401
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:13,278
No, no, no, no.

402
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,747
Oh, God, I'm...

403
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,235
Have a nice shave... Brian.

404
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,902
# I was sick and carsick #

405
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,006
# Back from the thru #

406
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:43,992
# Now, they tried to save her #

407
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,629
# But they couldn't do it #

408
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:49,615
# You're a future killer #

409
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:50,816
Stop!

410
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:53,485
# You must be made of silver #

411
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:57,389
# But you're slick and caustic #

412
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,693
# All thin and plastic #

413
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:04,663
Can you help me
shut this thing off?

414
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:05,864
Keys, Brian.

415
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,199
I tried the keys,

416
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:08,551
Walker.
- I'm sure you did.

417
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:11,170
Come on.

418
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:22,448
Have a nice day.

419
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,915
Dad knows.
- Dad knows what?

420
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,984
A neighbor called.

421
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,120
She said she saw you
in the parking lot

422
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:46,756
set off the car alarm
and make a scene.

423
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:49,941
Which would have been fine
if Mom had picked up.

424
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,560
But Dad took the call.

425
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,162
And went ballistic.

426
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:57,166
If you listen,
you can still hear the echo.

427
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:00,335
Where is Dad?

428
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,104
He's around.

429
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:04,707
What do you think, Arg?

430
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,775
Two-point range,
three points or what?

431
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:08,544
Wait, a fake pass-off?

432
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:09,879
Watch this, Arg.

433
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,147
Watch this, Argus, baby.

434
00:24:16,286 --> 00:24:17,887
What do you think, Arg?

435
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,521
Okay, here we go.

436
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,423
Oh! Short!

437
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:22,758
How is this, huh?

438
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,393
I'll get it
going, okay.

439
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,828
Two points, Argus!

440
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:27,563
Oh! Short!

441
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,864
Two more!

442
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:53,422
Come on, Dad.

443
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:56,158
About the car...
I mean, it was just a...

444
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,527
I've already discussed it with your mother.
- Great.

445
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,395
So, what's it going to be,
uh, uh...

446
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:03,098
grounded for the weekend or double chores?
- Nope.

447
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,333
I don't want to carry on
about it all afternoon.

448
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,603
I don't, either.
I just want it out of the way.

449
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:10,338
Well, I just told you, it is out of the way.
- Maybe it isn't.

450
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:12,324
Maybe it's even more in the way.

451
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:13,391
Hey, look.

452
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:15,360
I told your mother
I'd let it go.

453
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:16,962
Now it seems
like you're the one

454
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,997
that wants to make
a big deal out of it.

455
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:20,732
Oh, come on, Dad.
Tell me you're pissed!

456
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,567
That I took your car!

457
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,436
I took your car,
and rub it in

458
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:27,772
that your... your techie son
screwed up the alarm after all!

459
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:30,909
Frank! Telephone!

460
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,183
Yeah.

461
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,803
Okay, just be there
because I want to get back home.

462
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,104
Gotcha.

463
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,405
That's Clyde.

464
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:45,624
He blew the fuse in
his deep fryer again.

465
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:47,560
I got to go down
to the shop.

466
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,227
It's Thanksgiving.

467
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:51,329
Yeah. Clyde's got
a turkey to cook.

468
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:52,731
You really
don't remember

469
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,633
how we do things
around here, do you?

470
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:55,951
I'll go with you.

471
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:57,986
No, I can manage.

472
00:25:58,054 --> 00:26:00,556
I know you can.

473
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,209
All right.

474
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:45,433
You going
to close it?

475
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,680
Remember how Erin used
to say she wanted to live

476
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,983
in the same house
with you guys forever?

477
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,851
Even when she
had kids?

478
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,854
I don't think that'll happen.

479
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,706
You let her
believe it,

480
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,658
but you knew she never would.

481
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:13,294
Well, what do
kids know?

482
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,330
Yeah.

483
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:24,472
Saving my ass again, Frank.
Shame it ain't

484
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,874
more to look at, Clyde.

485
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:30,078
What you got?

486
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,200
Yeah, I think
we got you covered.

487
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,471
Oh, Walker said
you were back.

488
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,007
Guess we'll have us
a game this year after all.

489
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,244
That brother-in-law of yours
wasn't much at D-ball.

490
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:48,247
Or here in the shop,
for that matter.

491
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:52,468
My dad was kind of counting
on him to... take over.

492
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,403
Don't matter
now you're back.

493
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,488
You know this business
inside out.

494
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:59,358
Actually, I'm just back
for Thanksgiving.

495
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:01,360
Well, ain't none
of my business.

496
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:03,929
I guess this don't compare
to being a writer anyway.

497
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,466
Just like my dad says,
it's all chopping wood.

498
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:10,569
You go out to the pile
every day and just...

499
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:12,021
swing the ax.

500
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:15,090
That's why I don't get stuck
like some writers.

501
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,675
No kidding?

502
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:19,277
This ought
to do you.

503
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:20,979
Plus...

504
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,614
for backup.
- Ah.

505
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,883
What's the damage?

506
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:26,251
Well, we'll
settle up later.

507
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,054
Let's just get back
to our families.

508
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,622
Appreciate it, Frank.

509
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,325
Take care, Mr. Miller.

510
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:41,466
You know, this
whole thing

511
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:43,902
would never happen where I live.

512
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,938
Well, that's up to you.

513
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:47,673
Isn't it?

514
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,742
I don't actually run things
where I am.

515
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,146
Yeah, well, I suppose
that's as good an excuse as any.

516
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:59,551
We better be getting back.

517
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:02,254
We're going to be late
for Erin's.

518
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:11,996
Damn trains haven't run
on time since Mussolini.

519
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,333
You know
how your sister is.

520
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,536
And she's asked us
to pick up a few things.

521
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,613
All right. How much?

522
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,084
900.

523
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:35,553
For a photography class?

524
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:39,441
It's a photojournalism class,
Mom.

525
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,278
Honey, I love you,

526
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,280
but you are getting too old
for this.

527
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:10,856
Five bucks she says it
in the first three minutes.

528
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:12,290
Knock it off.
- Five bucks.

529
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:14,092
What's going on
back there, Kenneth?

530
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,861
I was talking
to Brian, Mommeth.

531
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:25,203
That's one...

532
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,288
leave-it-to-us
Thanksgiving.

533
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:30,625
What's in it?
- Turkey,

534
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:33,861
stuffing, cranberries,
mashed potatoes, gravy

535
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:34,779
and yams.
- Okay.

536
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,732
It's like a Happy
Meal on steroids.

537
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,066
Ooh, is there a toy?

538
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:39,601
Don't you start.

539
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,570
This is very important
to your sister.

540
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:42,571
I can tell.

541
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,972
She went to so
much trouble.

542
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,173
I got it.

543
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,575
Oh...
- Can you get it?

544
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:48,477
Do you want to...?
- It's heavy.

545
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:50,846
How are your kids?

546
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:53,115
Doing real well,
thank you.

547
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:54,315
Hold this.

548
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:55,516
I'll see you next week.

549
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:56,851
See you later.
- Okay.

550
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,236
Hello, Allison.
- Hey, Dottie.

551
00:30:58,538 --> 00:30:59,621
How are you?
- How are you, honey?

552
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:01,123
I'm good.
Nice to see you.

553
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,824
Hi, Kenny.
- What's up?

554
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:04,059
Is this the, uh...

555
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:05,594
Oh, that's not for us.

556
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,563
We're just helping out
some friends.

557
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,197
Did you know
that Brian is home?

558
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:10,899
Mmm.
- He's...

559
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,168
Well, where
in the world...?

560
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:15,153
Did you catch his latest?

561
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:16,688
No. What's it called?

562
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:20,125
<i>Adventures in the</i>
<i>Electromagnetic Spectrum.</i>

563
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:23,161
Is that like science fiction?

564
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:25,764
Yeah.

565
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,414
Where do you want this?

566
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:44,333
In the kitchen.

567
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,801
Turkey in a box.

568
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:48,770
Dad...

569
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,005
Hi, Mom.

570
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:51,506
You look pretty today.

571
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,241
Thank you.

572
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:58,981
You have a lovely home.

573
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:04,236
At least you're here finally.

574
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,670
What, are we late?

575
00:32:05,738 --> 00:32:07,706
No, it's just...
never mind.

576
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:09,274
It's fine.
- What, honey?

577
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:11,576
No, it's just...
nothing.

578
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:13,978
I don't want to
ruin Thanksgiving.

579
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:17,014
What's that
supposed to mean?

580
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,783
What?
- I saw that.

581
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:21,302
What?
- Think I didn't see that in my own home?

582
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,671
Saw what?

583
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:25,340
Kenny, you apologize
to your sister.

584
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:27,175
Apologize for what?

585
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,476
For what you just did.

586
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:30,094
I didn't do shit!

587
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,730
What if Maddy heard you?

588
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,383
Maddy is not even here.
Well, she's somewhere around here.

589
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,834
And little kids,
they hear everything.

590
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,468
You think they can't,
but they can.

591
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:40,188
Come on, Erin.
With the mouth your ex had on him?

592
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,107
I told you. I told you I
didn't want to talk about it

593
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:45,176
'cause I didn't want
to ruin Thanksgiving.

594
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:47,845
I told him, Mom.
I told him.

595
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,568
What?

596
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,342
Fuck!

597
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:02,144
I heard that.

598
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,696
The hell you did.

599
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:06,831
I'll tell Mom.
- Go right ahead,

600
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:07,782
you little toad.

601
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,468
I'll box your ears so hard

602
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,803
your brains will come
out of your nose.

603
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:13,472
<i>I</i> can get you
in trouble

604
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:15,090
anytime I want.

605
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:16,425
Ooh.

606
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:19,228
Big words from a micro-midget.

607
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:21,613
My dad

608
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,914
called.

609
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,282
Yeah, we got that.

610
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,852
Sorry, I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

611
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:31,890
Ever wonder how I became
the good uncle?

612
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,092
You're crazy talking
to Maddy like that.

613
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,426
Nah, she digs it.

614
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,628
We're buds.

615
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,497
Erin will tie you
to a tree

616
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:39,698
and cut your guts out.

617
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,299
From the looks of it,
Mom might help.

618
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,502
Well, somewhere there's
an eight-year-old little boy

619
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,870
depending on me
to keep Maddy

620
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:48,206
from becoming
an Erin clone.

621
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:55,346
I really like what Erin's
done with the place.

622
00:33:58,918 --> 00:34:01,086
What happened
to the furniture?

623
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,754
She nuked it.

624
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,288
Couldn't handle sitting
on the couch

625
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,925
she shared with <i>him!</i>

626
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:11,195
It's probably at the dumpster
with the turkey.

627
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:17,718
What the hell are we going to eat?

628
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:21,256
I don't know. Beats me.

629
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:22,057
Oh, God.

630
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,441
Too bad

631
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:25,093
she didn't get rid
of that thing.

632
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,445
Tinkerbell--

633
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:29,614
the other white meat.

634
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,283
I know it.

635
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,550
<i>Where-where are</i>

636
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:33,919
the yams? I don't
see the yams.

637
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,387
Where? Where?
I don't see...

638
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:36,854
Hey, calm down.

639
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,524
That's the
no-freaking-yams options.

640
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,858
Knock it off, Kenny!

641
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,061
Kenny, don't taunt your sister.

642
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,563
You find the yams.

643
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,566
Everybody breathe.

644
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:54,039
I can't eat here.

645
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:55,974
Where am I supposed
to put my food?

646
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,976
I'm going to be
wearing it.

647
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,978
You'll be fine.

648
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:09,054
We always have Thanksgiving
at our house.

649
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,524
Argus is fine.

650
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:23,485
God, are these the yams?

651
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:25,353
Of course
they're the yams.

652
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,622
Don't pay any attention
to him.

653
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,424
He could never tell the yams.

654
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:31,259
Okay,

655
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:32,794
who wants to start?

656
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:34,396
Well...

657
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:35,997
I'm thankful

658
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,182
for my family.
- for my family.

659
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,918
You say that every year,
Grandma.

660
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:43,287
Well, I guess
I'm just the lucky one.

661
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,089
Brian...?
- Oh.

662
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:47,492
I am...

663
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,227
um...

664
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:51,112
I'm glad to be home.

665
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,248
Don't make any hasty decisions
there, Brian.

666
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:56,918
Frank.

667
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:59,287
He's coming for me,

668
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:01,423
Dottie.

669
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,542
Just ignore him, honey.

670
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:04,742
Well,

671
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,745
hello, Tinky Winky.

672
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:09,714
Give me an excuse.

673
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:12,667
Dad, don't tease Tinky!

674
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,169
What about you, sweetheart?

675
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:17,005
What are you thankful for?

676
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:19,757
Macaroni and cheese would be
pretty good right about now.

677
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:22,227
Some comfortable chairs
would be pretty good

678
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:23,428
right about now.

679
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,729
Joke all you want,

680
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:26,464
but when things got tough for me
this year,

681
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,833
my family was
there for me.

682
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:31,436
And that's what it's about.

683
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:33,271
Being there for your family.

684
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:43,197
So you going to do
the right thing?

685
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:50,037
You know, Erin,

686
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:53,407
it's just not
my responsibility.

687
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:54,943
Really?

688
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,244
I mean...

689
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,246
don't you think you should
live your own life?

690
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:02,650
Well, it's not much
of a life, if you ask me.

691
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:05,787
How would you know?

692
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:07,021
How would you know?

693
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:09,190
Listen,
You're never even around.

694
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:11,860
Erin...

695
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,462
I am sorry about your divorce.

696
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,230
No, no.

697
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,715
Hear me out.

698
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:20,651
And I am sorry
that Dad had to fire him.

699
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,986
But I cannot

700
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,238
run the shop. I just can't.

701
00:37:24,306 --> 00:37:25,540
Run the shop?

702
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,075
You'd hate running the shop.

703
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:29,294
I know, that's what I'm saying.

704
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:31,780
Didn't Kenny talk to you?

705
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:36,651
A-R-G-U-S.

706
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,888
T-H-E D-O-G?

707
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,557
What about him?

708
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,530
Oh.
- Yeah.

709
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:50,398
Oh, what a relief.

710
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,833
I thought you wanted me

711
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,334
to run Dad's business,

712
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:56,270
but all you really want me to do
is euthanize his dog.

713
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:58,540
You're not here every day
like I am.

714
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,741
You don't see

715
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,225
what it's doing to them.

716
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:02,727
So you do it.

717
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:04,528
Like you said,
you're here every day.

718
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,598
It's not like you'd be...

719
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:08,432
killing him.

720
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,867
How do you figure that?

721
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,069
Brian, you've seen him.

722
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,637
He's more than
ready to go.

723
00:38:12,705 --> 00:38:14,138
Just help him out

724
00:38:14,206 --> 00:38:16,674
like that...
like that doctor.

725
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:18,109
But that doctor
doesn't wait

726
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,644
for everybody to look
the other way

727
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:20,945
to pull the plug.
- You know,

728
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:22,847
I'm really surprised
at your attitude.

729
00:38:22,915 --> 00:38:25,016
I thought you would want
to help Mom and Dad.

730
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,384
Everything all right in here?

731
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:28,886
Yeah.

732
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:31,856
Brian's, uh, being a big help.

733
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,859
And we're very proud
of your writing.

734
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,228
And don't you ever
forget that.

735
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,834
Okay.

736
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:44,836
Now drive safe

737
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:47,005
and make sure that doesn't go
to waste, okay?

738
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:49,373
Oh, we're going to be nibbling
on it all weekend.

739
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,375
And digesting it
all week.

740
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:54,946
Dad! I can't believe
you did that!

741
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:57,381
I'm going to be out here
looking for him all night.

742
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:58,883
You and the coyotes.
- Nice.

743
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:00,885
Real nice.
- Kenny and I will...

744
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:02,887
find him, right?
- Yeah.

745
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:04,889
Okay, you go inside.

746
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,390
Your brothers
will find him.

747
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,626
That was a lovely,
lovely night.

748
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,695
I'm awful proud of you.
- Thanks, Mom.

749
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:12,814
Okay, sweetie, go inside now.
- Okay.

750
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:22,440
Stupid cat.

751
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,097
We're not really going to look
for Tinkerbell, are we?

752
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:31,566
I'll give you
a hundred bucks

753
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,367
if you bring him to me.

754
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:38,172
See him?

755
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,641
There he is.

756
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,676
Come here, you little

757
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:45,480
Tinkerbell, you little...
nice kitty.

758
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,181
Come here.
Come on.

759
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:48,382
Come on.
Come on.

760
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:49,617
Nice kitty-kitty.

761
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:51,018
We all set?

762
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:51,820
Good...

763
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:07,135
85.

764
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,405
86.

765
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:15,009
# ...I'm gonna find me
a new one... #

766
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,211
87.

767
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:17,445
What was our record?

768
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,047
482.

769
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,582
You fumbled our chance
at 500.

770
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,584
Yeah, but it was
a bad throw.

771
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,320
Yeah, to you.

772
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:26,821
So?

773
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,857
You want to go
for the record.

774
00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:31,192
Or a beer run?

775
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,562
# ...but now my crying's
offended #

776
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:36,364
Oops.

777
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,167
Good choice.

778
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,535
Her name is Allison Harper,
by the way.

779
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,071
Who?
- The little cutie

780
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:44,805
that works the cash register
at the store.

781
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:47,008
Whatever.
- That Brian loves.

782
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:48,176
Not.

783
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,511
That he wants to kiss
on her little face.

784
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,918
You're practically
a regular.

785
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,920
Hey.
- Hi.

786
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:03,123
What are you doing here
on Thanksgiving anyway?

787
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,193
I know.
It's pathetic.

788
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:07,194
I know.

789
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,929
Almost as bad as one
of these families

790
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:11,932
that gets the turkey
in the box.

791
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,701
Yeah, what was
that about?

792
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,469
It's possible my family

793
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:18,907
might not be as functional
as they seem?

794
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,808
Possible.

795
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:22,860
Okay.

796
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:26,063
So what are you doing
here on Thanksgiving?

797
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:30,701
I get double time if I
work on Thanksgiving.

798
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:32,703
My folks just split up

799
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:34,705
and just feels like

800
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:36,908
the rest of my family
kind of did, too.

801
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,948
That's it?
- That's it.

802
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,950
What I owe you?

803
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:48,786
Uh, seven even is fine.

804
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:52,523
Thank you.

805
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,961
You ever go to the fair?

806
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,930
No.

807
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,066
I mean, I haven't in a while.

808
00:42:03,819 --> 00:42:06,020
But I'm going
to go this year.

809
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,224
Here you go.

810
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,026
Well, maybe
I'll see you there.

811
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,262
Do you want a bag for this?
- No.

812
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,280
Uh...

813
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,118
I read your book.

814
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:26,257
You read...

815
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,326
my book?

816
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,328
Mm-hmm.

817
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:31,195
Yeah.

818
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:32,363
Science fiction's--

819
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,582
it's amazing, you know.

820
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,418
You kind of feel like you're
in this whole other world.

821
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:39,854
No.

822
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,125
No?

823
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:47,428
You didn't read my book.

824
00:42:47,496 --> 00:42:49,097
Not science fiction?

825
00:42:49,164 --> 00:42:50,632
It's all right.

826
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:54,669
Um, it's not the kind of book
that people read.

827
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:55,486
What do you mean?

828
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:56,871
The pictures?

829
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:58,756
Um, there's some diagrams.

830
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:00,658
Like a... like

831
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:02,644
a graphic... artist?

832
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:04,045
Yeah, but I don't...

833
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:06,413
I just write the words.

834
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,149
That nobody reads.

835
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:10,468
Nothing like coming home
a success.

836
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,138
Sorry.

837
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:16,140
Hey, did you
just lie to me?

838
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,743
Would you just ask her out
so I can pay for my stuff?

839
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:21,279
I got to go.

840
00:43:21,346 --> 00:43:25,316
Uh, but maybe I will see you
tomorrow at the fair.

841
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:26,984
Is that your dad's car?

842
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:28,452
It's my brother's.

843
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:32,123
Have fun.

844
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:41,949
Think this is a violation
of the open container law?

845
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:44,251
I doubt it.

846
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,554
Are you ready
for the game?

847
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:49,607
I don't know.

848
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,558
It's... been a while.

849
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,427
Too bad there's not
a national D-ball league.

850
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:55,063
We could turn pro.

851
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,851
When was the last time you and I
had a serious conversation?

852
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,919
Why would you want to do that?

853
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:03,471
I mean, is...

854
00:44:03,538 --> 00:44:07,074
is that how you are
with your friends?

855
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,779
What makes you think
I have any friends?

856
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,481
I just want to know

857
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:16,517
if this is how you are
around other people

858
00:44:16,585 --> 00:44:19,120
or if it's just how you deal
with the family.

859
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:22,123
Why the Spanish Inquisition?

860
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:26,327
I was picturing you and Erin.

861
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:29,680
I'm trying to picture you
with other people.

862
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:31,815
No family around.

863
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:33,167
Yeah?

864
00:44:33,234 --> 00:44:34,752
How'd we look?

865
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,587
I don't know.

866
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:41,459
That's why I'm asking.

867
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:44,028
It's like quantum physics.

868
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:48,366
If you observe us,
we feel your influence

869
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:50,734
and we get spun
into the family order.

870
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:53,171
I don't want
to observe you.

871
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:55,606
I'm just asking
a question.

872
00:44:58,326 --> 00:44:59,994
I don't know, Bri.

873
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:03,764
I guess you'd have
to ask my friends.

874
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:08,736
Don't forget to lock up.

875
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:29,023
Thinking about
your new book?

876
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:31,926
No.

877
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:35,396
I was thinking
about Aunt Sharon.

878
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:36,965
Oh.

879
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:38,466
You didn't tell us,

880
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:41,970
and we didn't even get
to go to the funeral.

881
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:45,406
Children aren't expected
to go to funerals, honey.

882
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:49,010
We're far
from children, Mom.

883
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:51,946
Well, we all had enough
to worry about.

884
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:56,484
Erin with the divorce and you
with your new book and...

885
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,987
Kenny with...

886
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:00,855
I-I just now realize

887
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,156
that I don't even
really know

888
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:04,359
what happened
to Grandpa, and I...

889
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:06,727
Well, honey, you
were just a baby.

890
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:08,129
No, I was
in high school.

891
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:10,631
Yeah, you were all
at very difficult ages.

892
00:46:10,699 --> 00:46:12,666
Look, Mom...

893
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:16,570
I'm just wondering...
I mean, you and Dad

894
00:46:16,638 --> 00:46:18,306
are getting older,
and I just want

895
00:46:18,374 --> 00:46:19,807
to make sure that...
- Brian,

896
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,676
I don't know what you're
going on about, honey.

897
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:24,879
Isn't it time to go?

898
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:27,248
You ready?

899
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:29,984
I don't know, Mom.
Are you?

900
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:32,320
Why don't you just take
these into the kitchen

901
00:46:32,388 --> 00:46:34,355
and check on your father.

902
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,827
What's that?

903
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:59,296
Oh, it's, uh...

904
00:46:59,364 --> 00:47:01,431
I really don't know what it is.

905
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:04,201
Dr. Morrow prescribed it.

906
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:12,677
I never could understand
people who don't have pets.

907
00:47:12,744 --> 00:47:15,512
I read this article
once said that, uh...

908
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,447
dogs are little
freeloaders

909
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:19,583
that we're all suckers
for having.

910
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,252
Whoever wrote it never had one.

911
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,021
You got that right.

912
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:26,290
Here, you do it.

913
00:47:26,357 --> 00:47:29,193
Make sure he doesn't choke.

914
00:47:57,022 --> 00:47:58,890
Brian.

915
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:00,090
Hi.
- Hey.

916
00:48:00,158 --> 00:48:02,126
Hi.

917
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:03,628
Got a day off, huh?

918
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:04,629
Yeah.

919
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:06,030
Thought it might
be nice for us

920
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:08,232
to see each other
without exchanging money.

921
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:12,770
Sorry about that whole
thing with your book.

922
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:14,705
You and my publisher

923
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:18,175
and... my dad.

924
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:21,679
I see your dad
a lot, you know.

925
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:24,148
More than I do.

926
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,866
So...

927
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,853
Do you like fairs?

928
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:30,521
Uh...

929
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:34,925
There's this thing
I got to do with my family.

930
00:48:34,993 --> 00:48:36,293
It's sort of, um...

931
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:38,796
a goofy, embarrassing tradition.

932
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:40,798
Right. I know.

933
00:48:40,866 --> 00:48:42,182
I know.

934
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:43,701
My dad kept the game stats.

935
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:45,386
Oh, God.
- You're one of the all-time

936
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,637
high scorers.

937
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:49,223
Okay, now you're scaring me.

938
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:51,374
Yeah?
- Yeah, now I'm scared.

939
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:02,503
Hi.

940
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:04,071
You ready?
- Yeah.

941
00:49:06,274 --> 00:49:09,610
A longtime D-ball tradition
returns,

942
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:13,163
as the Millers
defend their title

943
00:49:13,231 --> 00:49:14,532
against the Worthingtons.

944
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,033
And I think this year,

945
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,452
we have a game on our hands.

946
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:21,889
# You went back #

947
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:24,792
# To the circus #

948
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:38,038
Let's see if the Worthingtons
can finally regain the title.

949
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:43,444
# But we didn't waste our time #

950
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,234
No, that was a foul!

951
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,803
# Hey, hey #

952
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:57,024
# And for those who never left #

953
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:01,495
The Millers
are on their game tonight.

954
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:04,515
# Don't you know
this dream is dead #

955
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,400
What a pass by Frank to Kenny.

956
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:18,696
# You held your breath
all through high school #

957
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:20,831
# You ain't my teacher #

958
00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:22,550
Foul. Two shots.

959
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:24,535
Kenny at the line for two shots.

960
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:26,069
I got this.
- Nice job, buddy.

961
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:28,105
I got this.

962
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,007
Yeah!

963
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:36,847
One more, one more.

964
00:50:36,915 --> 00:50:38,448
Put this thing
away now.

965
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:42,169
# Oh, tell me what did #

966
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:44,721
# You expect? #

967
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,575
Story of my life.
- Sorry, Dad.

968
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:51,345
If I did everything half right,
I'd be a happy man.

969
00:50:51,413 --> 00:50:53,330
Now, let's put
these bozos away.

970
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:55,132
Brian in-bounds,
you head for the basket.

971
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,567
I'll hit you
on the fly.

972
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:58,435
Dad...
- You can do it.

973
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:00,721
Just make an opening.
We'll be there, right?

974
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:03,390
Let's go.

975
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,825
All right.

976
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:07,328
# Oh, I've grown #

977
00:51:07,396 --> 00:51:09,180
Five seconds remain.

978
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:11,265
# Through love and death #

979
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:19,456
# Oh, I've grown #

980
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,094
# Through love and death. #

981
00:51:26,948 --> 00:51:28,398
Whoo!

982
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,325
- As though you've been playing
- You were right.

983
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:39,593
every week now.
- You were right.

984
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:41,395
And then Dad said,
"You can do it.

985
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:42,863
Just make an opening."

986
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:48,119
You're quiet.

987
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:52,189
I don't want to ruin it.

988
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:53,774
You couldn't.

989
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,011
Sweet.

990
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,913
Wrong, but sweet.

991
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,433
Would you do it?
Would you try it, honey?

992
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:04,802
Go get it. Go get it.

993
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:07,137
Yeah.

994
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:09,072
Coming home
for Christmas?

995
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:12,575
What's it to you?

996
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,578
Oh, please, get a stable.

997
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:18,182
Grandma says it's picture time.

998
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:21,584
It's picture time.

999
00:52:21,652 --> 00:52:23,153
Yeah, let's go.

1000
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:26,123
Everybody ready?

1001
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:29,526
Say, "Jackass!"

1002
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:31,595
Jackass!

1003
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:40,504
Next time, I should.
- You're the man.

1004
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:42,473
No, it's, "You da man."
- You... da man.

1005
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,908
No, <i>you</i> da man.
That's what I said.

1006
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:47,577
No, but then I say it back to you.
- Huh?

1007
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:49,579
Wait, wait, wait.

1008
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,015
Where... where's Argus?

1009
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:52,416
What do you mean?
- Here, hold this.

1010
00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:53,717
I'm sure he's fine, Dad.

1011
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,285
Well, don't just
stand there. Come on!

1012
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:56,686
You want to go
check upstairs?

1013
00:52:56,754 --> 00:52:58,955
Argus!
- Dad, I'm sure he's fine.

1014
00:52:59,024 --> 00:53:01,125
Argus!

1015
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:04,194
Argus?

1016
00:53:06,398 --> 00:53:08,132
Argus!

1017
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,000
Argus?

1018
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:11,668
Argus.

1019
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:13,970
He's not in here, Dad.

1020
00:53:17,459 --> 00:53:20,160
Ar... Ar... Argus!

1021
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:21,361
Argus?

1022
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:22,663
Hey, Dad, he's here!

1023
00:53:22,997 --> 00:53:24,381
Where? Where?
Where? Where?

1024
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:26,083
Where?

1025
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:28,052
What the hell is he
doing in there?

1026
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:29,553
Oh...

1027
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,888
Watch out, Victoria's Secret.

1028
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,990
Our next model
is Argus,

1029
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:35,792
wearing something
just a little bit naughty.

1030
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,928
God Almighty, Kenny.

1031
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:39,430
What's wrong with you?

1032
00:53:39,497 --> 00:53:40,931
Is everything a joke to you?

1033
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:54,078
He's just being Kenny.

1034
00:53:54,145 --> 00:53:55,946
You know, that's how he deals.

1035
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:58,315
That's just it.
He doesn't deal.

1036
00:53:58,383 --> 00:54:01,552
Well, he must have learned it
from someone.

1037
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:16,783
We had a pretty good run of it,
didn't we, buddy?

1038
00:54:27,345 --> 00:54:28,746
Let's go.

1039
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:30,547
I'm busy right now.

1040
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:31,982
With?

1041
00:54:33,518 --> 00:54:35,286
Getting Argus
some training wheels.

1042
00:54:35,353 --> 00:54:37,788
Come on.

1043
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:40,924
Is it some sort
of brotherly bonding thing?

1044
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:43,894
Because I'm a little maxed out
on that for today.

1045
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,061
Now!

1046
00:54:45,129 --> 00:54:47,531
What are you,
on some kind of word budget?

1047
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,066
Let's go!
Now! Come on.

1048
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:53,937
Fine.

1049
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:59,643
Can I help you
find something?

1050
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,613
Yes. My brother is
looking for condoms.

1051
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:04,531
Aisle 7A.

1052
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,816
And good for you.

1053
00:55:06,884 --> 00:55:09,386
Give me some rubber bands,
will you?

1054
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,054
Hey, Brian,

1055
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:12,622
if you get
the right-sized condoms,

1056
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,524
you won't need the rubber bands!

1057
00:55:14,592 --> 00:55:18,061
Brian Worthington!

1058
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,816
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1059
00:55:22,883 --> 00:55:25,285
Do you ever...

1060
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:27,454
Have you ever...

1061
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:30,123
thought of Mom and Dad
as just people?

1062
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:33,393
Like you said, none of us
knows how the others are

1063
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:35,295
outside of the freak show.

1064
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:37,164
What if...

1065
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,567
we're part of the reason
it's a freak show?

1066
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:42,036
Maybe we should try
not to think of them

1067
00:55:42,103 --> 00:55:43,971
as just parents.

1068
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,805
The alternative being?

1069
00:55:45,873 --> 00:55:48,525
Maybe like some kind
of friends or something.

1070
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:51,061
Weird... friends.

1071
00:55:52,163 --> 00:55:54,998
Do you have anything
for schizophrenia?

1072
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:58,619
All right, fine.

1073
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:02,089
Good night.

1074
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,260
Open that.

1075
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:10,063
And... hold that flat.

1076
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:12,032
# I'm going down to Mexico #

1077
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:14,768
# And I'm...
I'm never comin' back... #

1078
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:17,103
Damn, bra,
you really gonna do this?

1079
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:18,572
It's what you wanted, right?

1080
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,206
Not in my car.

1081
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,193
Man, I am not comfortable

1082
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:24,527
in this situation.

1083
00:56:24,595 --> 00:56:25,929
It's not about you, Kenny.

1084
00:56:25,997 --> 00:56:28,565
You could have told me
what you were up to.

1085
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:31,168
Man. Hope this
doesn't become

1086
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:33,170
some sort of weird
family tradition.

1087
00:56:33,238 --> 00:56:35,005
Why?

1088
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:37,473
Afraid you'll be next?

1089
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,642
I'll guess we'll have
to figure out

1090
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:42,679
something pretty special
for Christmas.

1091
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:45,733
# Silent night... #

1092
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,134
Yeah, bra, I...

1093
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:48,635
You're creeping me out.

1094
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:50,203
You don't even sound
like yourself.

1095
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:51,504
I'm sorry.

1096
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:53,140
It's my first homicide.

1097
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:54,607
Man.

1098
00:56:54,676 --> 00:56:55,976
Actually, you're right.

1099
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:58,545
Technically,
it would be a caninicide?

1100
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:00,280
That's it.

1101
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:02,900
I'm locking the bedroom door tonight.
- Good.

1102
00:57:02,967 --> 00:57:04,551
That'd be better.

1103
00:57:04,618 --> 00:57:05,719
No witnesses.

1104
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:08,889
# And make the same mistake
again #

1105
00:57:08,957 --> 00:57:10,323
# I take... #

1106
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:13,476
WOMAN
What do you care if I stay or go?

1107
00:57:13,544 --> 00:57:14,811
I need the car...

1108
00:57:14,946 --> 00:57:16,463
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.

1109
00:57:16,531 --> 00:57:17,798
Good night, honey.

1110
00:57:17,865 --> 00:57:19,349
Good night, Ma.

1111
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:20,650
Good night, sweetheart.

1112
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:21,985
Good night, Ma.

1113
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,653
You should get to bed, honey.

1114
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:26,189
You look very tired.

1115
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:31,128
# And the fact that you've been
back and forth... #

1116
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:33,480
Well, guess I'm gonna
head to bed, too.

1117
00:57:33,548 --> 00:57:35,349
Sleep well.

1118
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,433
# And you know
your heart's not... #

1119
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:40,137
Is that a valediction
or an epitaph?

1120
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,509
Don't forget to lock the door.

1121
00:57:46,577 --> 00:57:50,780
He was a quiet boy
who kept mostly to himself.

1122
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:00,123
MAN The Martians were fighting
for their own survival.

1123
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:02,475
Their planet was growing so cold
and inhospitable

1124
00:58:02,627 --> 00:58:05,278
that they might perish
if they remained...

1125
00:58:36,627 --> 00:58:39,095
Argus?

1126
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:45,969
Ar... gus?

1127
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:56,112
Oh, no.

1128
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:00,150
Argus?

1129
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,059
Shit!

1130
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:12,362
Damn it! Lily!

1131
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,796
Open!

1132
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:15,398
Come on, Lily. Cough it up!

1133
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:20,103
Open your mouth!

1134
00:59:21,873 --> 00:59:23,673
Brian?

1135
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:25,375
Everything all right?

1136
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:29,880
Um... I was, uh...

1137
00:59:29,947 --> 00:59:33,250
I was, uh, checking
on Argus, and...

1138
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:37,087
And Lily snuck up on me
and scared the hell out of me.

1139
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:38,654
She doesn't like
to be left out.

1140
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,858
It's just...
I mean, cone and, like...

1141
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:44,227
Are you just now going to sleep?

1142
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:46,129
No. I fell asleep on the couch.

1143
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:47,264
Oh.

1144
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,032
I always feel like
I miss something

1145
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,733
when that happens.

1146
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:53,803
Know what I mean?

1147
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:56,439
What's the matter?

1148
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:58,674
Mom, uh...

1149
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:02,979
I think Argus is, uh...

1150
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:08,434
I mean...

1151
01:00:18,612 --> 01:00:20,847
I see.

1152
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:22,983
Maybe I should
go wake up Dad.

1153
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:24,584
Oh, I don't know.

1154
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:26,887
You can't call the vet
at this hour.

1155
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:28,454
Mom?

1156
01:00:28,522 --> 01:00:29,790
What?

1157
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:31,758
He's dead.
- No, no.

1158
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:35,461
I mean, to pick him up and...
and take him.

1159
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,164
I'm gonna go wake up Dad.
- No, no, no, no.

1160
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:40,166
I don't want him
to see Argus like this.

1161
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:42,468
Maybe he should. Maybe...

1162
01:00:42,537 --> 01:00:44,604
Maybe we should leave it
up to him.

1163
01:00:44,672 --> 01:00:47,707
No. He's been through enough
already.

1164
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:49,009
All the more reason.

1165
01:00:49,076 --> 01:00:50,476
You don't understand

1166
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:52,646
what it's like
between your father and Argus.

1167
01:00:52,713 --> 01:00:53,947
I-I <i>do</i> understand.

1168
01:00:54,015 --> 01:00:55,181
He was more like

1169
01:00:55,249 --> 01:00:57,684
another son than...

1170
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:15,068
You don't know how hard
this has been.

1171
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:24,778
What a relief.

1172
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:34,654
I'm gonna go
and wake your father.

1173
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:48,001
Bye.

1174
01:01:56,577 --> 01:02:00,179
Yeah, I've been saying
good-bye to him every day

1175
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:02,716
just in case.

1176
01:02:08,288 --> 01:02:10,356
What's going on?

1177
01:02:10,424 --> 01:02:14,360
Argus... passed.

1178
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:15,561
That quick?

1179
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:18,064
Yeah. Seems that way, doesn't it?

1180
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:20,333
Yeah.

1181
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,301
He's here the one minute,
and then, the next...

1182
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,771
I guess it's not
a bad way to go.

1183
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:27,473
In your sleep.

1184
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:29,976
Sorry you had to be
the one to find him.

1185
01:02:30,044 --> 01:02:31,645
What do you think

1186
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:33,379
we should do with...?

1187
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:35,548
I mean,

1188
01:02:35,616 --> 01:02:38,051
with the...?

1189
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:44,658
A... funeral.

1190
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:45,859
What?

1191
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:47,193
I think we should have

1192
01:02:47,261 --> 01:02:48,628
a funeral for Argus.

1193
01:02:48,696 --> 01:02:49,929
I mean, it would...

1194
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:51,464
It's your choice, Dad.

1195
01:02:51,532 --> 01:02:52,699
He was... He was

1196
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,167
your dog, but I...

1197
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:56,402
I think
we should have a funeral.

1198
01:02:58,706 --> 01:03:01,340
Frank.

1199
01:03:01,408 --> 01:03:04,110
You-You...
You don't have to.

1200
01:03:15,823 --> 01:03:18,692
What are you doing?

1201
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:30,152
We both know
it was Brianic intervention.

1202
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,722
It's natural causes.
- I don't buy it.

1203
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:34,524
I don't believe you.

1204
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:36,827
He was already gone.
- Right.

1205
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:39,462
So Argus just chose that moment?
- I guess

1206
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,214
you'll have to wait
for the autopsy report.

1207
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:44,217
And what's with the funeral,
Brian?

1208
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:46,286
They didn't even tell us
when Aunt Sharon died.

1209
01:03:46,353 --> 01:03:48,621
And what about Grandma?
And what about Grandpa?

1210
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:50,756
Do you remember anything
about when they died?

1211
01:03:50,824 --> 01:03:52,008
No, I don't.

1212
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,377
But you're trying to make up
for lost time

1213
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:56,178
by having a funeral for a dog.

1214
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:57,514
Dad

1215
01:03:57,581 --> 01:04:00,033
is having a funeral for Argus.

1216
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,252
Funny...
because I don't remember

1217
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,756
Dad coming up
with that idea.

1218
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,527
Don't mess with this, Kenny.

1219
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:12,929
I mean it.

1220
01:04:12,997 --> 01:04:14,931
Whatever.

1221
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:19,335
Who put you in charge anyway?

1222
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:21,437
All of you did.

1223
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:09,953
See you, buddy.

1224
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:30,856
Nice helmet.

1225
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:44,320
Mom.
Shh.

1226
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:48,858
Sorry I'm late.

1227
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:55,331
All right, I'm going
to go take a nap.

1228
01:05:58,118 --> 01:06:00,770
Um, it's a pile of dirt.

1229
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:03,673
It's symbolism.

1230
01:06:08,095 --> 01:06:09,779
Nice helmet.

1231
01:06:18,806 --> 01:06:20,874
How's Dad doing?

1232
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:26,379
Dad... is Dad.

1233
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:47,316
I think I'll put on
another record.

1234
01:07:27,441 --> 01:07:29,609
Why don't you get
some of this, too?

1235
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:31,778
Kenny,

1236
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:33,013
will you have some green beans?

1237
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,281
No, thanks. I'll have
another roll, though.

1238
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:39,402
I suppose that's
your idea of a vegetable, isn't it?

1239
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,838
Thanks.

1240
01:07:41,905 --> 01:07:44,974
Which one of you
killed my dog?

1241
01:07:48,779 --> 01:07:51,313
I know it wasn't you.
You weren't here.

1242
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:52,465
I was with Mommy.

1243
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:54,400
I know you were, sweetheart.

1244
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:57,069
Frank...
- All three of you know

1245
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:58,305
the pretzel routine.

1246
01:07:58,372 --> 01:08:01,941
Which of you put this into one?

1247
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:07,830
Nobody killed Argus, Dad.

1248
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:08,831
Is that right?

1249
01:08:08,899 --> 01:08:11,367
He died of natural
causes, huh?

1250
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:12,635
Yeah, he did.

1251
01:08:12,703 --> 01:08:14,103
Well, then, can you explain

1252
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,138
how this got into one
of his pretzel nuggets?

1253
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:18,708
'Cause I put it there,
and not just that one.

1254
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:21,677
I had a whole plateful,
and, um...

1255
01:08:21,745 --> 01:08:24,180
I went in last night,

1256
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:26,466
and I was going to give them
to him, but when I got there,

1257
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:28,234
he was already gone.

1258
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:29,535
Brian...

1259
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,053
Whoa, saved
by the closing bell.

1260
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:37,593
Would you have done it?

1261
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:39,295
I had gotten that far.

1262
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:40,596
Pointing a rifle

1263
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:42,632
and pulling
the trigger

1264
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:44,683
are two different things.

1265
01:08:45,019 --> 01:08:48,605
Dad, it wasn't just Brian.

1266
01:08:48,672 --> 01:08:50,940
I was involved, too.

1267
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:54,694
I mean, I wasn't in the den
with him, but...

1268
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:56,229
I was still involved.

1269
01:08:56,296 --> 01:09:00,449
Erin, would you take Maddy
into the next room, honey?

1270
01:09:00,517 --> 01:09:05,354
No, we're, we're
going to stay.

1271
01:09:05,422 --> 01:09:07,090
Erin.

1272
01:09:07,157 --> 01:09:09,209
Mom.

1273
01:09:14,765 --> 01:09:18,084
What about you, Dottie? What...?

1274
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:20,286
Frank, I...
- It wasn't them, Dad.

1275
01:09:20,353 --> 01:09:22,121
It was just me.

1276
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:25,124
Well, why this one?

1277
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:25,400
What?

1278
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:27,226
This one-- why this
one and not another one?

1279
01:09:27,294 --> 01:09:28,895
I don't know.

1280
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:31,647
I figured that would
have done the trick.

1281
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:34,850
He never would have
gotten this down.

1282
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:52,886
I used...

1283
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:56,489
a prescription sleeping pill.

1284
01:09:56,824 --> 01:09:58,507
You what?

1285
01:09:58,575 --> 01:09:59,842
After doing some research

1286
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:03,880
on the... on the Web.

1287
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:07,433
It's amazing
what you can find out there.

1288
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:09,635
Kind of scary, actually.

1289
01:10:09,703 --> 01:10:11,053
But Frank, you...

1290
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:14,991
He was my dog, Dottie, my dog.

1291
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:16,658
It was time,

1292
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:19,278
but he wouldn't go

1293
01:10:19,346 --> 01:10:21,797
on his own, and I didn't...

1294
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:24,434
I couldn't let
anyone else do it.

1295
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,803
I'll allow that...

1296
01:10:27,871 --> 01:10:31,407
you had my best interests
in mind, but you...

1297
01:10:31,475 --> 01:10:36,245
I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't thank you.

1298
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:44,320
All right.

1299
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:27,747
Brian.

1300
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,648
Mom, I just got
to get it off my...

1301
01:11:29,717 --> 01:11:32,018
Just make an opening
for him.

1302
01:11:48,235 --> 01:11:50,652
Remember Eddie Tyler?

1303
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,988
That little toad

1304
01:11:52,055 --> 01:11:54,740
that kept falling
out of the treehouse?

1305
01:11:54,942 --> 01:11:56,609
It's amazing he never got hurt.

1306
01:11:56,677 --> 01:11:59,028
He used to say that

1307
01:11:59,096 --> 01:12:03,466
he... wishes his dad was like...

1308
01:12:03,533 --> 01:12:04,800
my dad.

1309
01:12:05,002 --> 01:12:08,671
Well, that's probably because

1310
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:11,708
I was the one that,
uh, picked him up

1311
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:15,511
and, uh, dusted him off.

1312
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:18,348
Whatever happened to him anyway?

1313
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:20,183
After jail?

1314
01:12:21,335 --> 01:12:22,735
He, uh,

1315
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:24,370
moved away. We lost touch.

1316
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:25,905
Well,

1317
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:29,642
I don't know.
Maybe that's... not so bad...

1318
01:12:31,878 --> 01:12:34,263
...for your childhood friends
to...

1319
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:36,932
always be children.

1320
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,434
What about your own kids?

1321
01:12:38,502 --> 01:12:42,037
Seems like it would be easier
once they got older.

1322
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:44,657
You know, not
having all that...

1323
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:46,075
responsibility.

1324
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:47,276
You always feel

1325
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:49,245
the responsibility.

1326
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:55,568
It's only the influence
that goes away,

1327
01:12:55,635 --> 01:12:57,653
and the aura.

1328
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,788
You think it's yours,
but then

1329
01:12:59,856 --> 01:13:02,991
eventually you realize that, uh,

1330
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:06,095
it comes from your children.

1331
01:13:06,163 --> 01:13:08,697
You don't get to keep it
forever.

1332
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:12,701
One day they see you
in all your flawed

1333
01:13:12,769 --> 01:13:14,703
and limited glory,

1334
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:17,706
and they withdraw it.

1335
01:13:17,774 --> 01:13:20,443
One by one, y-you,
you turned into people,

1336
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:23,212
and God help me, I didn't know
what to do with you.

1337
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,813
Maybe you don't have to do
anything.

1338
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:28,567
Oh, just, just be supportive,
be there for you?

1339
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:30,719
Is tha... is that
how they say it, huh?

1340
01:13:30,787 --> 01:13:32,488
I don't know how
to be anything to you

1341
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:36,075
but your father.
- You stopped being my father

1342
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:38,728
when I stopped being a kid,

1343
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:41,264
and that is not how it works.

1344
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:44,067
Well, are you an expert
on fatherhood now?

1345
01:13:44,134 --> 01:13:45,134
No.

1346
01:13:45,202 --> 01:13:46,835
But I know that you
wanted it back.

1347
01:13:46,903 --> 01:13:48,037
You wanted it back.

1348
01:13:48,105 --> 01:13:50,339
Like the way we were
when we were little.

1349
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:52,508
You wanted it so much.

1350
01:13:52,576 --> 01:13:54,510
I replaced you.

1351
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:00,749
You think I didn't know?

1352
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:04,687
Well, maybe-- I guess, maybe,

1353
01:14:04,754 --> 01:14:06,572
uh, I didn't for a while.

1354
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,508
Not till Argus
started to...

1355
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:15,398
They never grow up.

1356
01:14:15,465 --> 01:14:18,484
They can't.

1357
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:21,453
But you lose them, too.

1358
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,808
Brian?

1359
01:14:26,876 --> 01:14:28,310
Honey, would you give

1360
01:14:28,378 --> 01:14:30,212
Kenny a hand?

1361
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:42,875
I'll be right there, Mom.

1362
01:14:47,714 --> 01:14:49,866
Got it?
- Yeah.

1363
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:54,203
So, what'd he say?

1364
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:58,857
He said, uh...

1365
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:02,544
You know what?

1366
01:15:02,612 --> 01:15:04,914
He said he was proud of you.

1367
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:07,399
He said he was proud of me?

1368
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:08,667
For what?

1369
01:15:08,735 --> 01:15:11,704
Well, for sticking up for me.

1370
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:14,824
Dad said that?

1371
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:17,376
Pretty much.

1372
01:15:21,331 --> 01:15:23,132
Put that away.

1373
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,401
Sure.

1374
01:15:40,283 --> 01:15:42,884
Brian.

1375
01:15:45,755 --> 01:15:48,056
Is Dad okay?

1376
01:15:48,225 --> 01:15:50,008
Yeah, Dad's fine.

1377
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:53,512
Yeah.

1378
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,515
He said it was amazing

1379
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,851
how you toughed it out
with your family.

1380
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:02,271
Dad said that?

1381
01:16:02,339 --> 01:16:03,839
About me?

1382
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:05,974
Mmm, pretty much.

1383
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:11,898
You can't make this stuff up,
can you?

1384
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:22,358
Don't forget your jars, kids.

1385
01:16:22,425 --> 01:16:25,327
Hey.

1386
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,068
What?

1387
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:34,636
What's with you two?

1388
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:35,787
Nothing.

1389
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,473
Not a thing.

1390
01:16:40,176 --> 01:16:41,794
I got yours, little miss.

1391
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:44,647
And Maddy's favorite.

1392
01:16:44,714 --> 01:16:46,749
Oh, that one's for Kenny.

1393
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:48,250
Well, honey,

1394
01:16:48,318 --> 01:16:49,952
they're all the same.

1395
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:53,556
Okay.

1396
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:55,675
Thanks, Mom.

1397
01:16:55,742 --> 01:16:57,843
Yeah, thanks.

1398
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:59,879
Well...

1399
01:16:59,946 --> 01:17:02,314
this has been such
a nice visit.

1400
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:07,636
Yep.

1401
01:17:11,207 --> 01:17:12,608
A little dry.

1402
01:17:12,676 --> 01:17:15,243
I would have used
a more conversational style.

1403
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:17,446
And the dedication's
a little psycho.

1404
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:21,884
Truly, deeply scared.

1405
01:17:21,952 --> 01:17:24,086
What's scary is
that she's right.

1406
01:17:26,089 --> 01:17:28,223
How would you know?

1407
01:17:32,112 --> 01:17:33,779
No way.

1408
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:36,782
Hey, you're my bro.

1409
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,285
Now you're creeping me out.

1410
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:41,520
Well, if it was
any consolation,

1411
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:43,522
I didn't enjoy it.

1412
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:47,826
I'll be right there, baby.

1413
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:50,029
All right, sugar.

1414
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:56,068
Kenneth.

1415
01:17:58,138 --> 01:18:00,773
Was he always like that?

1416
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,975
Pretty much.

1417
01:18:07,814 --> 01:18:09,748
So?

1418
01:18:14,587 --> 01:18:17,890
You think Dad's going
to sell the shop?

1419
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,359
No.

1420
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:23,362
Can't run it by himself forever.

1421
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,731
You're not the only
that used to work there

1422
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:28,734
during the summers.

1423
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:30,236
Maddy's in third grade.

1424
01:18:30,304 --> 01:18:34,473
She's at school all day,
and, well...

1425
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:36,475
I drive a truck.

1426
01:18:40,613 --> 01:18:43,749
You know, it makes
total sense somehow.

1427
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:45,751
You think?

1428
01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:53,875
Are you all buckled in?

1429
01:18:53,943 --> 01:18:55,877
Yeah.
- Nice.

1430
01:18:55,945 --> 01:18:58,414
So...

1431
01:18:58,481 --> 01:19:00,615
give me a call,
you little weirdo.

1432
01:19:00,683 --> 01:19:01,850
What for?

1433
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:04,386
Whatever.

1434
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:06,205
Are you done
corrupting my child?

1435
01:19:06,272 --> 01:19:08,474
Nope. I'm just getting started.

1436
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:12,044
Well...

1437
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:14,847
Whoa.
- Oh, whatever.

1438
01:19:14,914 --> 01:19:16,349
That's fine.

1439
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:19,552
No, just give me
a little warning.

1440
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:23,456
I'm ready.

1441
01:19:25,592 --> 01:19:26,892
All right.

1442
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:33,665
So... you're taking
over the shop?

1443
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:36,585
Maybe.

1444
01:19:36,653 --> 01:19:37,570
Cool.

1445
01:19:37,637 --> 01:19:39,454
Call me if you need any help.

1446
01:19:39,522 --> 01:19:41,490
Thanks.

1447
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,343
Thanks!

1448
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:46,829
Heard you the first time.

1449
01:19:46,897 --> 01:19:48,831
Right.

1450
01:19:48,998 --> 01:19:51,166
Hey, Dad...

1451
01:19:51,234 --> 01:19:53,085
Redskins are playing

1452
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:54,970
tonight.

1453
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:56,872
Should be a good game.

1454
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,239
Yeah.

1455
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:00,442
Should be. Should be.

1456
01:20:11,104 --> 01:20:12,771
Bye, sweetheart.

1457
01:20:12,839 --> 01:20:14,006
I love you.

1458
01:20:14,074 --> 01:20:15,341
I love you, too.

1459
01:20:15,408 --> 01:20:16,909
I'm proud of you.

1460
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:01,903
# It's hard to breathe
in the city #

1461
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:05,824
# It's easier to drink #

1462
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,961
# Come in my house #

1463
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:11,197
# We'll sit in the dark #

1464
01:21:11,264 --> 01:21:14,433
# And try not to think #

1465
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:18,404
# About the green fields #

1466
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:21,039
# The way the land feels

1467
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:25,277
# All we left behind #

1468
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:27,313
# Oh, how a dream... #

1469
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,881
Message one.

1470
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:31,850
Hey, hey, Brian?

1471
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:37,956
Um... I-I wanted to let you know
that the Redskins won.

1472
01:21:38,024 --> 01:21:42,894
Yeah, they went into overtime,
but they pulled it off.

1473
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:45,831
So, um...

1474
01:21:45,898 --> 01:21:48,167
okay, bye.

1475
01:21:49,603 --> 01:21:51,437
# ...in the ground #

1476
01:21:51,505 --> 01:21:54,489
# Silently... #

1477
01:21:54,557 --> 01:21:56,491
<i>I love you, too, Dad.</i>

1478
01:21:56,559 --> 01:22:00,446
# ...I fall too far down #

1479
01:22:00,513 --> 01:22:05,150
# Tear me #

1480
01:22:05,218 --> 01:22:09,988
# A hole in the ground #

1481
01:22:10,056 --> 01:22:11,990
# Oh #

1482
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:32,010
# Tear me #

1483
01:22:32,078 --> 01:22:36,181
# From my hometown #

1484
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:40,986
# Dig me #

1485
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:45,257
# A hole in the ground #

1486
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:49,961
# Silently #

1487
01:22:50,029 --> 01:22:54,299
# I fall so far down #

1488
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:59,004
# Tear me #

1489
01:22:59,071 --> 01:23:03,709
# A hole in the ground #

1490
01:23:03,777 --> 01:23:06,712
# Oh #

1491
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:26,632
# And it's hard to breathe
in the city #

1492
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:31,036
# It's easier to drink #

1493
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:33,505
# So come to my house #

1494
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:35,774
# We'll sit in the dark #

1495
01:23:35,842 --> 01:23:39,678
# And try not to think. #

1496
01:23:51,157 --> 01:23:54,092
# I got my papers in order #

1497
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,595
# Gonna find me a new love #

1498
01:23:56,663 --> 01:24:00,599
# Gonna find me a new love now #

1499
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:03,769
# I got my papers in order #

01:24:03,837 --> 01:24:06,304

1501
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:10,542
# Gonna find me a new love now #

1502
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,044
# I cried all I could afford #

1503
01:24:13,112 --> 01:24:15,814
# But now my crying
time's ending #

1504
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:20,185
# That's the message
I'm sending out #

1505
01:24:20,252 --> 01:24:22,888
# I got my papers in order #

1506
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:25,557

# Gonna find me a new love now #

1508
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:35,567
# Well, everybody's got
their own excuses #

1509
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:39,905
# I know I've had mine, too #

1510
01:24:39,973 --> 01:24:44,910
# But I'm not gonna let
a few bumps and bruises #

1511
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:48,113
# Keep me
from breaking through #

1512
01:24:55,922 --> 01:24:58,390
# I got my papers in order #

1513
01:24:58,457 --> 01:25:00,893
