11
00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:41.477
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

12
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.730
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to,

13
00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:48.484
and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

14
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.527
Do you maggots understand that?

15
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.904
Sir, yes, sir.

16
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:55.407
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

17
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:56.909
Sir, yes, sir.

18
00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:01.455
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training,

19
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:02.957
you will be a weapon.

20
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.168
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

21
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.129
But until that day, you are pukes.

22
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.674
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

23
00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:14.218
You are not even human fucking beings.

24
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:19.223
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

25
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.309
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

26
00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:25.187
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

27
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.439
I am hard but I am fair.

28
00:02:27.523 --> 00:02:29.900
There is no racial bigotry here.

29
00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:34.196
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

30
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.824
Here, you are all equally worthless.

31
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.868
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers

32
00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:42.997
who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

33
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.165
Do you maggots understand that?

34
00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.583
Sir, yes, sir.

35
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.460
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

36
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:50.629
Sir, yes, sir!

37
00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:54.049
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

38
00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.802
Bullshit. From now on, you're Private Snowball.

39
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.263
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!

40
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:02.182
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

41
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.518
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon

42
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.812
on a daily basis in my mess hall.

43
00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.439
Sir, yes, sir!

44
00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:12.151
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

45
00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:14.069
Who said that?

46
00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:16.196
Who the fuck said that?

47
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.825
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here

48
00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.619
who just signed his own death warrant?

49
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.997
Nobody, huh?

50
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.876
The fairy fucking godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

51
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.670
I will P.T. you all until you fucking die.

52
00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:34.590
I'll P.T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

53
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.634
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.

54
00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:41.013
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

55
00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.475
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

56
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.395
Well, no shit.

57
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.899
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

58
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.984
I admire your honesty.

59
00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:57.571
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

60
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:03.452
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

61
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.704
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

62
00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:08.040
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

63
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.834
Now, get up. Get on your feet.

64
00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:15.672
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

65
00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:19.259
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

66
00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:21.512
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

67
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.556
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

68
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.059
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

69
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:30.604
Ah! That's a war face.
Now, let me see your war face.

70
00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:36.777
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

71
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.613
You don't scare me. Work on it.

72
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.365
Sir, yes, sir!

73
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.783
What's your excuse?

74
00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.326
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

75
00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.329
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

76
00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.540
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

77
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.251
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

78
00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.587
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.

79
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.798
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

80
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.676
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

81
00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.178
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

82
00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:04.805
Sir, 5'9", sir.

83
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.766
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

84
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.269
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

85
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.438
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you

86
00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:17.276
ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

87
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.735
I think you've been cheated.

88
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.113
Where the hell are you from, private?

89
00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:23.782
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

90
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.994
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

91
00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:30.664
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

92
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.833
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

93
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.294
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

94
00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.921
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass

95
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:41.717
and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

96
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.927
I'll be watching you.

97
00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:47.764
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

98
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.142
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

99
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:53.270
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

100
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.023
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

101
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.900
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

102
00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:01.695
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

103
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.822
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

104
00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:06.950
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball

105
00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:09.036
- through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

106
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.662
I don't like the name Lawrence.

107
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:12.998
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

108
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.792
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

109
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.587
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

110
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.882
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

111
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.926
Sir, yes, sir.

112
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.220
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

113
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:30.140
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds,

114
00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:32.392
exactly three fucking seconds,

115
00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:35.145
to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face,

116
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.316
or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

117
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.027
One. Two. Three.

118
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.782
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

119
00:06:48.242 --> 00:06:50.494
Now choke yourself.

120
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:54.706
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

121
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.961
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

122
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.922
Now, lean forward and choke yourself.

123
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.928
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

124
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.680
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

125
00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:12.057
Sir, yes, sir.

126
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.061
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

127
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.063
Sir, yes, sir.

128
00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.066
That's enough. Get on your feet.

129
00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:28.699
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links,

130
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.451
or I will definitely fuck you up.

131
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.537
Sir, yes, sir.

132
00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.208
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

133
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.711
Left, right, left, right, left.

134
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.504
Left, right, left, right, left...

135
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.299
Parris Island, South Carolina,

136
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:48.719
the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

137
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.514
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

138
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.517
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

139
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.437
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

140
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.440
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

141
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.984
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

142
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:07.112
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

143
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.572
- P.T.
- P.T.

144
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.073
- P.T.
- P.T.

145
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:11.575
- Good for you
- Good for you

146
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.201
- And good for me
- And good for me

147
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:14.661
- Mmm, good
- Mmm, good

148
00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:17.581
Up in the morning to the rising sun

149
00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.250
Up in the morning to the rising sun

150
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:23.170
Gonna run all day till the running's done

151
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:26.465
Gonna run all day till the running's done

152
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.468
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

153
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.095
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

154
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.140
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

155
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:38.393
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

156
00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:42.105
Left, right, left, right, left.

157
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.484
Your left shoulder. Hah.

158
00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:49.821
Left, right, left. Port. Hah.

159
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:54.159
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

160
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.455
Left shoulder. Hah.

161
00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:04.002
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

162
00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:06.630
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle,

163
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:10.050
but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

164
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.594
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

165
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:15.680
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

166
00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:18.683
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, left side, sir.

167
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.437
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

168
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:26.191
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, right side, sir.

169
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.693
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

170
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.529
Pick up your fucking cover.

171
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:31.905
Sir, yes, sir.

172
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.242
Your left shoulder. Hah.

173
00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:39.496
Left, right, left. Port. Hah.

174
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.625
Left shoulder. Hah.

175
00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.838
Your right shoulder. Hah.

176
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:54.386
Left, right, left, right. Your left shoulder. Hah.

177
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.764
Left, two, three, four.

178
00:09:57.848 --> 00:10:00.934
Your right shoulder. Hah.

179
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.232
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

180
00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:10.902
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

181
00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:16.283
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

182
00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:20.912
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch

183
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:25.250
through her purty pink panties are over.

184
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.502
You're married to this piece.

185
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:30.338
This weapon of iron and wood.

186
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.675
And you will be faithful.

187
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:36.761
Arms. Hah.

188
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.557
Prepare to mount.

189
00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:46.104
Mount.

190
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.528
Port. Hah.

191
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.575
Pray.

192
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.328
This is my rifle.

193
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.998
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

194
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.834
My rifle is my best friend.

195
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:09.628
It is my life.

196
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:14.132
I must master it
as I must master my life.

197
00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:17.302
Without me, my rifle is useless.

198
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:20.263
Without my rifle, I am useless.

199
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:23.350
I must fire my rifle true.

200
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.562
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

201
00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:30.690
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

202
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.400
I will.

203
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.237
Before God, I swear this creed.

204
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.115
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

205
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.535
We are the masters of our enemy.

206
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.162
We are the saviors of my life.

207
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:48.583
So be it until there is no enemy, but peace.

208
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.460
Amen.

209
00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:53.088
Arm. Hah.

210
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.218
At ease.

211
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.637
Good night, ladies.

212
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.431
Good night, sir.

213
00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.393
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

214
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.480
Right shoulder. Hah.

215
00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:17.487
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

216
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:22.367
Left shoulder. Hah.

217
00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:29.541
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

218
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.628
Port. Hah.

219
00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:40.051
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

220
00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:43.221
This is my rifle, this is my gun

221
00:12:43.305 --> 00:12:45.890
This is for fighting, this is for fun

222
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.518
This is my rifle, this is my gun

223
00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:51.062
This is for fighting, this is for fun

224
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.732
This is my rifle, this is my gun

225
00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:56.359
This is for fighting, this is for fun

226
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.945
This is my rifle, this is my gun

227
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.573
This is for fighting, this is for fun

228
00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.075
This is my rifle, this is my gun

229
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.995
This is for fighting, this is for fun

230
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.918
You're bouncing.

231
00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:30.977
Ten fucking seconds.

232
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:36.024
It should take you no less than 10
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

233
00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.651
Quickly, move it out.

234
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.488
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate

235
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:45.909
until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

236
00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.434
Next two privates. Quickly.

237
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.312
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

238
00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:16.606
Next two privates. Quickly.

239
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.149
Hurry up. Get up there.

240
00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.985
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:22.862
Let me hear your war cry.

242
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.950
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

243
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.244
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

244
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.162
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

245
00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:35.208
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

246
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:39.838
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

247
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.799
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

248
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.176
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

249
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.514
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

250
00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.391
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

251
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:55.770
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

252
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.313
Sir, yes, sir.

253
00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.068
One for the commandant.

254
00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.280
One for the Corps.

255
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.200
Get up there. Pull.

256
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:13.121
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

257
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:16.332
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

258
00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.043
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

259
00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:22.797
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

260
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:26.634
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

261
00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:31.181
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

262
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.308
Get up there, Snowball.

263
00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.144
Get up here, fat-boy.

264
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:39.564
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

265
00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:43.943
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

266
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.405
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

267
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:51.117
Private Pyle, whatever you do, don't fall down.

268
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.495
That would break my fucking heart.

269
00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.123
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

270
00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:00.835
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

271
00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.756
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

272
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.425
Are you quitting on me?

273
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.636
Well, are you?

274
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:14.098
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

275
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.768
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

276
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.687
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

277
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.065
Now. Move it.

278
00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:27.612
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

279
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.406
I will motivate you, Private Pyle,

280
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:35.119
if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

281
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.790
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

282
00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:41.000
Quickly. Move it out.

283
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:45.797
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

284
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.299
Or did you have to work on it?

285
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:52.053
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

286
00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:56.808
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

287
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.476
Move it.

288
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.856
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

289
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.066
Do it now.

290
00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.653
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

291
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.323
Do you feel dizzy?

292
00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.784
Do you feel faint?

293
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:20.498
Jesus H. Christ, I think you've got a hard-on.

294
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:26.170
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

295
00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.881
Get up here.

296
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:31.676
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

297
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.845
Quickly.

298
00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:37.807
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

299
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.073
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

300
00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.117
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

301
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.203
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

302
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.748
Get your bunks made and get your uniforms on.

303
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.876
Police call will commence in two minutes.

304
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.419
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

305
00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.171
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

306
00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.883
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

307
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:15.136
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary

308
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:19.390
that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

309
00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:20.892
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

310
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.311
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

311
00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.229
Sir, no, sir.

312
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.111
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

313
00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.489
Sir, the private said, "No, sir," sir.

314
00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:37.825
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

315
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:42.205
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary,

316
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.582
or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

317
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:47.085
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary, don't you?

318
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.503
Sir, negative, sir.

319
00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.172
Private Joker, are you trying to offend me?

320
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.674
Sir, negative, sir.

321
00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.927
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong,

322
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.931
and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

323
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:01.724
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

324
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.727
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

325
00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.771
Private Snowball.

326
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.607
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

327
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.444
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

328
00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:16.072
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

329
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.950
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

330
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:22.036
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on,

331
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.540
Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

332
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:26.958
He'll teach you everything.

333
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.377
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

334
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.631
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

335
00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.550
Now, you ladies, carry on.

336
00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.885
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

337
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.854
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

338
00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:53.651
Operating-rod handle.

339
00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:56.237
Operating-rod guide.

340
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:59.949
And the left one over the right.

341
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.160
Right one over the left.

342
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.873
Left one over the right.

343
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:09.292
The right one over the left.

344
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:15.089
Just throw your other leg over.

345
00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.596
Attaboy.

346
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:27.643
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

347
00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.146
Ready?

348
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.153
Just throw it over.

349
00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:45.828
Attaboy.

350
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.955
Set it down.

351
00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.293
All right?

352
00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:55.338
There you go.

353
00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:59.175
Congratulations, Leonard.

354
00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.885
You did it.

355
00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:04.722
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

356
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:07.183
Make a four-inch fold.

357
00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:10.103
Okay? Got it?

358
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.146
You do it.

359
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.067
Right shoulder. Hah.

360
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.903
Your left shoulder. Hah.

361
00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.449
Port. Hah.

362
00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.747
Order. Hah.

363
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:55.565
Your right shoulder. Hah.

364
00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.195
Square these weapons away.

365
00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:04.365
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the...

366
00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.787
The deadliest weapon in the world

367
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:13.833
is a Marine and his rifle.

368
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:17.503
It is your Killer instinct
which must be harnessed

369
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:21.757
if you expect to survive in combat.

370
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:25.469
Your rifle is only a tool.

371
00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:28.139
It is a hard heart that Kills.

372
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:33.811
If your Killer instincts are not clean and strong,

373
00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:37.023
you will hesitate at the moment of truth.

374
00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.192
You will not kill.

375
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:41.736
You will become dead-Marine.

376
00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:45.239
And then you will be in a world of shit.

377
00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.158
Because Marines

378
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:50.912
are not allowed to die without permission.

379
00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:52.747
Do you maggots understand?

380
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.415
Sir, yes, sir.

381
00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.836
I love working for Uncle Sam

382
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.756
I love working for Uncle Sam

383
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:04.675
Lets me know just who I am

384
00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:07.678
Lets me know just who I am

385
00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:10.681
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

386

One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

387
00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:16.687
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

388
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:19.690
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

389
00:23:19.774 --> 00:23:21.192

390
00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:22.693

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:28.741
I don't know, but I've been told

394
00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:31.786
I don't know, but I've been told

395
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.705
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

396
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:37.708
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

397
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.210
- Mmm, good
- Mmm, good

398
00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:40.711
- Feels good

399
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.213
- Is good

400
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:43.714

00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:48.219
- Good for you

00:23:48.302 --> 00:23:49.762
- Good for me
- Good for me

405
00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:53.849
Trim them.

406
00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.604
Toe jam.

407
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.359
Pop that blister.

408
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:14.912
Jesus H. Christ.

409
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:19.125
Private Pyle, why is your footlocker unlocked?

410
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.459
Sir, I don't know, sir.

411
00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:24.088
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate,

412
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:27.591
it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

413
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:30.303
- Sir, yes, sir.
- If it wasn't for dickheads like you,

414
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:33.055
there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

415
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:35.141
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

416
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.357
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

417
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.154
Holy Jesus.

418
00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:50.114
What is that?

419
00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:52.908
What the fuck is that?

420
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:54.785
What is that, Private Pyle?

421
00:24:54.869 --> 00:24:56.203
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

422
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.748
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

423
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.043
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

424
00:25:02.126 --> 00:25:04.295
Is chow allowed in the barracks, Private Pyle?

425
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:08.174
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

426
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:10.718
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

427
00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:12.553
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

428
00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:17.767
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.

429
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:21.479
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

430
00:25:21.562 --> 00:25:23.647
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

431
00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.859
Because you were hungry.

432
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:34.116
Private Pyle has dishonored himself

433
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.911
and dishonored the platoon.

434
00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:41.040
I have tried to help him, but I have failed.

435
00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:46.128
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

436
00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:50.341
You people have not given Private Pyle

437
00:25:50.424 --> 00:25:52.676
the proper motivation.

438
00:25:53.386 --> 00:25:58.391
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up,

439
00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:00.851
I will not punish him.

440
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:03.479
I will punish all of you.

441
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.731
And the way I see it, ladies,

442
00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:08.984
you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

443
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:11.821
Now get on your faces.

444
00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:14.990
Open your mouth.

445
00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:17.618
They're paying for it, you eat it.

446
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:20.204
Ready, exercise.

447
00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:22.998
One, two, three, four

448
00:26:23.082 --> 00:26:25.626
I love the Marine Corps

449
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:28.212
One, two, three, four

450
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:30.756
I love the Marine Corps

451
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.384
One, two, three, four

452
00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.886
I love the Marine Corps

453
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.556
One, two, three, four

454
00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:41.058
I love the Marine Corps

455
00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:43.519
One, two, three, four...

456
00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:47.731
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

457
00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:55.823
Joker.

458
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.995
Everybody hates me now.

459
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.374
Even you.

460
00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:10.754
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

461
00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:13.466
You just keep making mistakes.

462
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:15.885
Getting everybody in trouble.

463
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:21.390
I can't do anything right.

464
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:25.811
I need help.

465
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.692
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

466
00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:35.571
I'm really trying.

467
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.867
Tuck your shirt in.

468
00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:46.290
One, two, three, 19.

469
00:27:46.373 --> 00:27:48.501
One, two, three, 20.

470
00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:50.753
One, two, three, 21.

471
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.963
One, two, three, 22.

472
00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:55.049
One, two, three, 23.

473
00:27:55.132 --> 00:27:57.259
One, two, three, 24.

474
00:27:57.343 --> 00:27:59.428
One, two, three, 25.

475
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:01.472
One, two, three, 26.

476
00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:03.682
One, two, three, 27.

477
00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:05.851
One, two, three, 28.

478
00:28:05.935 --> 00:28:07.978
One, two, three, 29.

479
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:10.564
One, two, three, 30.

480
00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:37.901
Do it.

481
00:29:37.985 --> 00:29:39.236
Do it.

482
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:51.707
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

483
00:29:57.755 --> 00:29:58.756
Ow.

484
00:30:20.027 --> 00:30:22.237
Port. Hah.

485
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:26.492
Left shoulder. Hah.

486
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:31.538
Right shoulder. Hah.

487
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:36.877
Port. Hah.

488
00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:42.299
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

489
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:46.804
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

490
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:49.056
What makes the grass grow?

491
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:51.225
Blood, blood, blood.

492
00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:54.144
What do we do for a living, ladies?

493
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:55.979
Kill, kill, kill.

494
00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:57.773
I can't hear you.

495
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.650
Kill, kill, kill.

496
00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:02.861
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

497
00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:04.613
Kill, kill, kill.

498
00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:09.326
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

499
00:31:10.828 --> 00:31:13.330
None of you dumb-asses knows?

500
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:15.708
Private Cowboy.

501
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:20.254
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

502
00:31:20.337 --> 00:31:23.257
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people

503
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.636
from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

504
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.639
From distances of up to 400 yards.

505
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.685
Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

506
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:35.894
Private Snowball.

507
00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.397
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

508
00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:41.400
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

509
00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:45.154
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

510
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.073
All right, knock it off.

511
00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:50.159
Two-hundred-and-fifty feet.

512
00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:54.538
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

513
00:31:54.621 --> 00:32:00.294
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
Italian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds

514
00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:03.922
and scored two hits, including a head shot.

515
00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:08.218
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

516
00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:10.804
Private Joker.

517
00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:12.890
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

518
00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:15.601
In the Marines. Outstanding.

519
00:32:15.684 --> 00:32:20.731
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

520
00:32:20.814 --> 00:32:23.484
And before you ladies leave my island,

521
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:26.904
you will all be able to do the same thing.

522
00:32:27.237 --> 00:32:31.408

523

526
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:48.759
Today

527
00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:51.094
is Christmas.

528
00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:55.516
There will be a magic show at 0930.

529
00:32:56.767 --> 00:33:00.395
Chaplain Charlie will tell you

530
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:05.108
about how the free world
will conquer communism

531
00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:09.279
with the aid of God and a few Marines.

532
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:14.409
God has a hard-on for Marines

533
00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:19.248
because we kill everything we see.

534
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.792
He plays his games,

535
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:24.670
we play ours.

536
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:29.716
To show our appreciation for so much power,

537
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.972
we keep heaven packed with fresh souls.

538
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:39.977
God was here before the Marine Corps.

539
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.146
So you can give your heart to Jesus,

540
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.025
but your ass belongs to the Corps.

541
00:33:47.109 --> 00:33:49.152
Do you ladies understand?

542
00:33:49.236 --> 00:33:52.322
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

543
00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.283
Sir, yes, sir.

544
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.375
It's been swabbed and brushed.

545
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:06.545
Everything...

546
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.298
is clean.

547
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:14.970
Beautiful.

548
00:34:16.555 --> 00:34:19.182
So that it slides perfect.

549
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.811
Nice.

550
00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:27.274
Everything clean.

551
00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:29.693
Oiled.

552
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.948
So that your action is beautiful.

553
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:41.163
Smooth Charlene.

554
00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:05.896
Leonard talks to his rifle.

555
00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:09.775
Yeah.

556
00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:20.202
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.

557
00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:24.164
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

558
00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:29.711
It don't surprise me.

559
00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:43.558
I wanna slip my tube steak into your sister.

560
00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.855
What will you take in trade?

561
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:52.985
What do you got?

562
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.292
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

563
00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:12.129
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

564
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:14.131
Sir, yes, sir.

565
00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:19.344
What's your sixth general order?

566
00:36:19.428 --> 00:36:21.972
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey

567
00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:24.599
and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

568
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.518
all orders...

569
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.478
Sir, the private's sixth general...

570
00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:31.064
The private has been instructed,
but does not know.

571
00:36:31.148 --> 00:36:34.484
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

572
00:36:34.568 --> 00:36:36.737
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

573
00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:43.285
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

574
00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:46.663
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

575
00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:51.126
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

576
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.794
What's your fifth general order?

577
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:57.007
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

578
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.967
What's this weapon's name, Private Pyle?

579
00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:01.970
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

580
00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:04.890
Private Pyle, you are definitely born-again hard.

581
00:37:04.973 --> 00:37:08.685
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

582
00:37:08.769 --> 00:37:10.896
Sir, yes, sir.

583
00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:16.026
I don't want no teenage queen

584
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:18.820
I don't want no teenage queen

585
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:21.656
I just want my M14

586
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.409
I just want my M14

587
00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:27.287
If I die in a combat zone

588
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.040
If I die in a combat zone

589
00:37:30.123 --> 00:37:32.751
Box me up and ship me home

590
00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:35.545
Box me up and ship me home

591
00:37:35.629 --> 00:37:38.381
Pin my medals upon my chest

592
00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:41.134
Pin my medals upon my chest

593
00:37:41.218 --> 00:37:43.887
Tell my mom I done my best

594
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.515
Tell my mom I done my best

595
00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:51.686
Graduation is only a few days away,

596
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.399
and the recruits of Platoon 3092 are salty.

597
00:37:56.483 --> 00:38:00.529
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

598
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:06.535
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

599
00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:10.330
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

600
00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:13.458
The Marine Corps wants Killers.

601
00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:17.420
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

602
00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:19.714
Men without fear.

603
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.888
Today, you people are no longer maggots.

604
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.018
Today, you are Marines.

605
00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:35.438
You're part of a brotherhood.

606
00:38:35.522 --> 00:38:39.693
From now on, until the day you die,

607
00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:42.195
wherever you are,

608
00:38:42.279 --> 00:38:45.824
every Marine is your brother.

609
00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:50.078
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

610
00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:53.456
Some of you will not come back.

611
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.834
But always remember this:

612
00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:57.878
Marines die.

613
00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:00.589
That's what we're here for.

614
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:03.842
But the Marine Corps lives forever,

615
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:08.722
and that means you live forever.

616
00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:14.311
- Peckett.
- Sir, yes, sir.

617
00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:16.146
0300, Infantry.

618
00:39:16.229 --> 00:39:17.898
- Toe Jam.
- Sir, yes, sir.

619
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:19.900
0300, Infantry.

620
00:39:20.025 --> 00:39:21.818
- Adams.
- Sir, yes, sir.

621
00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:23.653
1800, Engineers.

622
00:39:23.737 --> 00:39:25.363
You go out and find mines.

623
00:39:25.447 --> 00:39:27.324
- Cowboy.
- Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:39:27.407 --> 00:39:30.952
- 0300, Infantry. Taylor.
- Sir, yes, sir.

625
00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:32.913
0300, Infantry.

626
00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:34.664
- Joker.
- Sir, yes, sir.

627
00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:38.001
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

628
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:40.212
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

629
00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:41.922
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

630
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:44.090
You think you're some kind of fucking writer?

631
00:39:44.174 --> 00:39:46.676
Sir, I wrote for my high-school newspaper, sir.

632
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.513
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

633
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:51.932
A Killer, yes, sir.

634
00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:53.683
Gomer Pyle.

635
00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:56.478
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

636
00:39:56.561 --> 00:40:00.565
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

637
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:02.817
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

638
00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:09.866
Our last night on the island.

639
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.577
I draw fire watch.

640
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:18.476
Hi, Joker.

641
00:41:40.457 --> 00:41:44.002
Are those live rounds?

642
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:53.845
Seven-six-two millimeter.

643
00:41:55.472 --> 00:41:58.892
Full metal jacket.

644
00:42:07.442 --> 00:42:09.444
Leonard,

645
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.697
if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

646
00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:17.660
we'll both be in a world of shit.

647
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:23.249
I am...

648
00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:26.961
in a world...

649
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:31.049
of shit.

650
00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:36.471
Left shoulder. Hah.

651
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:40.100
Right shoulder. Hah.

652
00:42:42.602 --> 00:42:43.853
Lock and load.

653
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.735
Order. Hah.

654
00:42:52.862 --> 00:42:54.697
This is my rifle.

655
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:57.575
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

656
00:42:58.868 --> 00:43:02.205
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.

657
00:43:02.288 --> 00:43:04.874
Get back in your bunks.

658
00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:07.210
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

659
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:12.257
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

660
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.760
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

661
00:43:15.844 --> 00:43:18.763
Why is Private Pyle holding that weapon?

662
00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:22.308
Why aren't you stomping Private Pyle's guts out?

663
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:25.687
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor

664
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:30.525
that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

665
00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:41.911
Now, you listen to me, Private Pyle,

666
00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:44.789
and you listen good.

667
00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:47.542
I want that weapon,

668
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:50.295
and I want it now.

669
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:55.091
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet

670
00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:58.052
and step back away from it.

671
00:44:05.518 --> 00:44:09.063
What is your major malfunction, numb-nuts?

672
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:13.443
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

673
00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.095
Easy, Leonard.

674
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.601
Go easy, man.

675
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.545

You party?

689
00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.375
Yeah, we might party.

690
00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:37.337

- Fifteen dollar.

691
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.549
- Fifteen dollars for both of us.
- No. Each you $15.

692
00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:43.635
Me love you long time.

693
00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:46.429
Me so horny.

694
00:46:46.512 --> 00:46:48.931
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

695
00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:52.352
- Five dollars each.
- Me sucky-sucky.

696
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.063
Me love you too much.

697
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:59.817
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

698
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:02.945
Okay. Ten dollar each.

699
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:05.615
What do we get for $10?

700
00:47:05.698 --> 00:47:08.576
Everything you want.

701
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.871
- Everything?
- Everything.

702
00:47:12.914 --> 00:47:14.832
Well, old buddy,

703
00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:17.043
feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

704
00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:19.087
Just a minute.

705
00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.299
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

706
00:47:23.383 --> 00:47:25.468
The other half have got TB.

707
00:47:26.302 --> 00:47:28.388
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

711

712
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.650
Yeah.

713
00:48:24.485 --> 00:48:27.113
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

714
00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:28.573
What?

715
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:32.660
We're supposed to be helping them,
and they shit all over us every chance they get.

716
00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:34.787
I just can't feature that.

717
00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:38.374
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

718
00:48:40.168 --> 00:48:43.588
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

719
00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:45.715
I've been in country almost three months,

720
00:48:45.798 --> 00:48:48.676
and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

721
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.888
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

722
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:54.348
A high school girl could do my job.

723
00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:56.309
I wanna get out into the shit.

724
00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:59.020
I wanna get some trigger time.

725
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:03.483
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world

726
00:49:03.566 --> 00:49:05.401
and she'll beat the shit out of me.

727
00:49:05.485 --> 00:49:08.029
That's a negative, Rafterman.

728
00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:14.744
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet today.
Anybody got anything new?

729
00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:20.750
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be cancelled.

730
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:22.877
Rear-echelon paranoia.

731
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.215
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

732
00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.842
They say the same thing every year.

733
00:49:29.926 --> 00:49:31.761
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

734
00:49:31.844 --> 00:49:33.763
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

735
00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:38.100
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

736
00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:41.646
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs,

737
00:49:41.729 --> 00:49:44.106
barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

738
00:49:45.066 --> 00:49:48.444
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

739
00:49:48.528 --> 00:49:51.906
I want someone there on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

740
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.492
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

741
00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:56.410
And get some good low-angle stuff.

742
00:49:56.494 --> 00:50:00.623
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

743
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:03.084
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

744
00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:06.963
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

745
00:50:07.046 --> 00:50:10.424
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees.

746
00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:13.678
If they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

747
00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:15.596
I'll make a note of it, sir.

748
00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:18.808
"NVA soldier deserts after reading pamphlets.

749
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:23.020
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win,

750
00:50:23.104 --> 00:50:25.982
deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets.”

751
00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:29.277
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

752
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.155
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

753
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:34.365
I'll fix it up, sir.

754
00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:36.993
Lawrence Welk Show is out on TV in two weeks.

755
00:50:37.076 --> 00:50:38.202
Dave, do 100 words on it.

756
00:50:38.286 --> 00:50:40.872
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.

757
00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.832
"Not while we're eating.

758
00:50:42.915 --> 00:50:45.251
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission

759
00:50:45.334 --> 00:50:48.045
don't like to be interrupted while eating chow."

760
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:52.091
Search-and-destroy. Uh, we have a new
directive from MAF on this.

761
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:56.888
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

762
00:50:56.971 --> 00:51:00.308
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

763
00:51:01.142 --> 00:51:03.436
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

764
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.062
Sir?

765
00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:09.650
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

766
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:11.110
Didn't see them.

767
00:51:12.153 --> 00:51:15.573
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

768
00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:19.201
Grunts who give half their pay to buy gooks
toothbrushes and deodorants.

769
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:21.662
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

770
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:25.416
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

771
00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:29.253
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

772
00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:31.088
It was raining, sir.

773
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:34.467
Well, that's why God passed the law of probability.

774
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.720
Now, rewrite it and give it a happy ending.
Say, uh, one Killed.

775
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:40.222
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

776
00:51:40.723 --> 00:51:42.058
Whichever you say.

777
00:51:42.141 --> 00:51:44.685
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

778
00:51:44.769 --> 00:51:47.021
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

779
00:51:48.564 --> 00:51:49.899
Joker...

780
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:53.486
maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

781
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:56.781
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

782
00:51:56.864 --> 00:51:59.075
Now, it is our job to report the news

783
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:02.286
that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

784
00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:06.707
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

785
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:10.544
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

786
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.214
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

787
00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:15.341
Can't say I liked it much.

788
00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:18.511
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

789
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:21.722
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong,

790
00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:23.766

I gotta get back in the shit.

799
00:52:58.718 --> 00:53:01.846
I ain't heard a shot fired in anger in weeks.

800
00:53:02.638 --> 00:53:04.015
Joker's so tough...

801
00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:06.642
he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose,

802
00:53:06.726 --> 00:53:09.729
then ask for seconds.

803
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:12.314
Listen up, pilgrim.

804
00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:16.944

Shit.

806
00:53:18.863 --> 00:53:22.825
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

807
00:53:22.908 --> 00:53:24.952
He's never been in the shit.

808
00:53:25.036 --> 00:53:27.830
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

809
00:53:27.913 --> 00:53:30.541
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

810
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:33.377
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die,

811
00:53:33.461 --> 00:53:36.422
you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

812
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.007
I was there, man.

813
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.842
I was in the shit with the grunts.

814
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:43.804
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

815
00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:47.391
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

816
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.395
You listen to Joker, new guy. He knows ti ti.

817
00:53:51.479 --> 00:53:53.105
Very little.

818
00:53:53.189 --> 00:53:56.067
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

819
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.779
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

820
00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:02.948
A Marine gets it after
he's been in the shit for too long.

821
00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:04.617
It's like--

822
00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.911
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

823
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:08.913
I got it.

824
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.915
All field Marines got it.

825
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.583
And you'll have it too.

826
00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:14.043
I will?

827
00:54:14.126 --> 00:54:15.795
Hey, Payback.

828
00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:19.006
How do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

829
00:54:19.632 --> 00:54:22.259
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

830
00:54:27.515 --> 00:54:29.642
- Incoming.
- Oh, shit.

831
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.187
Them are outgoing.

832
00:54:35.147 --> 00:54:37.399
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

833
00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:39.193
Now, what did I just say?

834
00:55:17.273 --> 00:55:20.568
Hey, I hope
they're just fucking with us.

835
00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:23.946
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

836
00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:18.792
Cease fire.

837
00:56:22.755 --> 00:56:25.007
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

838
00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:30.638
Cease fire.

839
00:56:41.607 --> 00:56:42.816
The enemy...

840
00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:45.736
has very deceitfully...

841
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.989
taken advantage of the Tet ceasefire...

842
00:56:49.448 --> 00:56:51.992
to launch an offensive all over the country.

843
00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.872
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

844
00:56:56.956 --> 00:56:59.166
But we seem to be the exception.

845
00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:04.713
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

846
00:57:04.797 --> 00:57:10.761
In Saigon, the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

847
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:12.888
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

848
00:57:12.972 --> 00:57:16.225
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

849
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:20.396
We also have reports that a division of NVA

850
00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:25.526
has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

851
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:28.737
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half,

852
00:57:28.821 --> 00:57:31.699
the civilian press are about to wet their pants,

853
00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:36.245
and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

854
00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:38.664
In other words...

855
00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:44.086
it's a huge shit sandwich,
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

856
00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:48.716
Sir.

857
00:57:49.049 --> 00:57:51.885
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

858
00:57:56.724 --> 00:58:01.061
Joker, I want you to get straight up to Phu Bai.

859
00:58:01.562 --> 00:58:04.773
Captain January will need all his people.

860
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:07.234
- Yes, Sir.
- And, Joker,

861
00:58:07.318 --> 00:58:10.404
you will take off that damn button.

862
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:13.991
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

863
00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:17.328
Sir, permission to go with Joker?

864
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:20.664
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

865
00:58:20.748 --> 00:58:23.792
Sir, permission not to take Rafterman with me?

866
00:58:23.876 --> 00:58:26.045
You still here?

867
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:29.840
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

868
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.800
You're responsible for him.

869
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:09.797
Get some.

870
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:12.341
Get some.

871
00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:17.846
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

872
00:59:18.847 --> 00:59:22.601
Get some. Get some. Come on. Come on.

873
00:59:26.647 --> 00:59:28.232
Get some.

874
00:59:34.947 --> 00:59:37.908
Ha-ha! Get some, baby.

875
00:59:38.242 --> 00:59:40.661
Get some. Get some. Get some.

876
00:59:41.662 --> 00:59:44.331
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

877
00:59:44.415 --> 00:59:46.959
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:49.336
I've got you, mother.

879
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:52.673
Ha-ha!

880
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:57.302
Anyone who runs is a VC.

881
00:59:57.845 --> 01:00:00.431
Anyone who stands still

882
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.850
is a well-disciplined VC.

883
01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:09.106
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

884
01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:13.318
Why should we do a story about you?

885
01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.821
Because I'm so fucking good.

886
01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:18.115
That ain't no shit neither.

887
01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:22.744
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

888
01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.706
And 50 water buffaloes too.

889
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.667
Them are all certified.

890
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.670
Any women or children?

891
01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.797
Sometimes.

892
01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:38.635
How can you shoot women and children?

893
01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.596
Easy.

894
01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:43.098
You just don't lead them so much.

895
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.602
Ain't war hell?

896
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.349
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

897
01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.142
Down the road. Two-Five.

898
01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:29.937
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

899
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.338
Excuse me.

900
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.881
Sir.

901
01:01:57.965 --> 01:02:01.176
We're looking for 1st Platoon, Hotel Two-Five.

902
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.761
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

903
01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.346
You people one-one?

904
01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.807
No, sir. We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

905
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.809
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, Sir.

906
01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.019
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

907
01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:13.981
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

908
01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.818
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

909
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.196
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

910
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.615
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

911
01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:25.284
I played ball for Notre Dame.

912
01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.743
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

913
01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:29.621
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

914
01:02:29.705 --> 01:02:31.373
Never happen, sir.

915
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:35.836
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

916
01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.172
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

917
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.092
Outstanding, sir. We taking care of business?

918
01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.760
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

919
01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:46.471
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river,

920
01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:48.849
street by street and house by house.

921
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.018
Charles definitely got his shit together,

922
01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:53.437
but we're still getting some decent kills here.

923
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.816
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

924
01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.401
That's affirmative.

925
01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:03.238
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

926
01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:05.532
Will you show me where, sir?

927
01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.453
Here's the canal.

928
01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:35.604
The dead have been covered with lime.

929
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.691
The dead know only one thing:

930
01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:42.903
It is better to be alive.

931
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.827
Excuse me?

932
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:53.288
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

933
01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:57.000
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

934
01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.627
What outfit are you men with?

935
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.879
Sir, we're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

936
01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.714
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker,

937
01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:05.175
and this photographer is Rafterman.

938
01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.969
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

939
01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:11.056
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

940
01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.266
Do you know how it happened, sir?

941
01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:17.479
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

942
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:22.192
Government officials, policemen,
ARVIN officers, school teachers.

943
01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.361
They went around to their houses real polite

944
01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:27.823
and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

945
01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.659
Everybody who turned up got shot.

946
01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.411
Some they buried alive.

947
01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.954
Ready.

948
01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:36.957
Colonel.

949
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.253
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

950
01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:42.671
A peace symbol, sir.

951
01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:45.424
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

952
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:47.759
What is that written on your helmet?

953
01:04:47.843 --> 01:04:49.344
Born to Kill, sir.

954
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.597
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

955
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:55.100
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

956
01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:57.853
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

957
01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.354
I don't know, sir.

958
01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.022
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

959
01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:04.443
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

960
01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.361
- Yes, sir.
- Now, answer my question,

961
01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:08.864
or you'll be standing tall before the man.

962
01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:12.033
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

963
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:15.746
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

964
01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:19.207
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

965
01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:21.042
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

966
01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.794
How about getting with the program?

967
01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:25.380
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

968
01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:26.673
Yes, sir.

969
01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:31.219
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

970
01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:33.138
We are here to help the Vietnamese,

971
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:37.225
because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

972
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:39.060
It's a hardball world, son.

973
01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:42.898
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

974
01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.024
Aye, aye, sir.

975
01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:58.246

1113
01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.719
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

1114
01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:29.432
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

1115
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:36.689
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang

in the waiting room.

Instant Section Eight.

1118
01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:48.367
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1119
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.748
You ready? Turn over.

1120
01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.585
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1121
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:03.758
Well, like-- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city,

1122
01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:07.428
so we have to assault with, uh, tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1123
01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:10.014
So they send us in first to squat,

1124
01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:13.893
make sure that there are no, uh, little...

1125
01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:18.272
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1126
01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:20.941
So we clear it out and we roll the tanks in

1127
01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.402
and basically blow the place to hell.

1128
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:27.657
When we're in Hue, when we're in Hue City,

1129
01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.784
it's like a war, you know,

1130
01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.869
like what-- What--

1131
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:35.039
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was--

1132
01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:37.625
You know, was supposed to be.

1133
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:41.045
Uh, there's the enemy, you kill them.

1134
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:44.799
Well, I don't think there's any question
about it. I mean, we're the best.

1135
01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:47.134
I mean, all that bullshit about the Air Cav...

1136
01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:49.428
When the shit hits the fan, who do they call?

1137
01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:52.890
They call Mother Green and her killing machine.

1138
01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:56.060
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam? Um...

1139
01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:00.648
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1140
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:03.067
Can I quote LBJ?

1141
01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:08.155
"I will not send American boys

1142
01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:10.574
8 or 10,000 miles around the world

1143
01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:14.912
to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves."

1144
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:21.168
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war,

1145
01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:25.089
you know, I mean, like they--
It's sort of like...

1146
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:29.051
they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1147
01:21:29.135 --> 01:21:30.803
But they don't want it.

1148
01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.389
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1149
01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.516
Poor, dumb bastards.

1150
01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:41.188
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty-- Pretty bad boys.

1151
01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:43.065
I'm not real, uh...

1152
01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:47.111
I'm not real keen on some of these fellas

1153
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:50.698
that are supposedly on our side.

1154
01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.659
I keep meeting them coming the other way.

1155
01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:56.787
Yeah.

1156
01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.582
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people,

1157
01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:01.876
and they don't even appreciate it.

1158
01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:04.503
They think it's a big joke.

1159
01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.131
Well, if you ask me, uh...

1160
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.633
we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1161
01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.679
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1162
01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:17.349
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1163
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:21.187
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1164
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.063
Well, I think we should win.

1165
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.733
I hate Vietnam.

1166
01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:27.943
There's not one horse in this whole country.

1167
01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:30.237
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1168
01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:32.990
There's something basically wrong with that.

1169
01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.410
Well, if they'd send us more guys, maybe,

1170
01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:40.539
and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1171
01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:46.879
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1172
01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:51.133
I, uh-- I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1173
01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:53.302
and kill them.

1174
01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:58.557
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed Kill.

1175
01:23:17.243 --> 01:23:19.411
Ten hut.

1176
01:23:21.205 --> 01:23:22.790
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

1177
01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:25.876
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

1178
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.087
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1179
01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.755

1180
01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:33.634
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number-one fucky?

1181
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:34.844
Oh, yeah.

1182
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.680
Hey, any of you boys
want number-one fucky?

1183
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.266
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1184
01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:43.644
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1185

She give you everything you want, long time.

1186

Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1187
01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.903
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

1188
01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.155
- Number 10.
- Uh-uh.

1189
01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.950

- Five dollars.

1194
01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:06.500
No. Ten dollars.

1195
01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.919
Be glad to trade you some ARVIN rifles.

1196
01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.171
Ain't never been fired and only dropped once.

1197
01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:14.550
Okay, $5. You give me.

1198
01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:17.052
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1199
01:24:18.304 --> 01:24:19.430
Let's get mounted.

1200
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.687
Something wrong there, chief?

1201
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.856
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1202
01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:30.566
What the motherfuck?

1203
01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:33.277
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1204
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.737
What is this, man?

1205
01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:38.866
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1206
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.704
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1207
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:45.539
Oh, shit.

1208
01:24:45.623 --> 01:24:49.418
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1209
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.671
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1210
01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:54.715
Excuse me, ma'am.

1211
01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.468
What we have here, little yellow sister,

1212
01:24:57.551 --> 01:25:02.014
is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1213
01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.808
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1214
01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:08.312
Okay, okay.

1215
01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:11.607
Okay, okay.

1216
01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:14.068
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1217
01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:16.445
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

1218
01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:20.032
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1219
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:23.494
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1220
01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:26.789
Hey, Animal, man. You son of a--

1221
01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:31.085
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1222
01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:33.545
- I don't want it after you.
- Fuck you.

1223
01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:09.081
Intelligence passed the word down

1224
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:12.793
that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area

1225
01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.963
to positions across the Perfume River.

1226
01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:20.467
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1227
01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:54.710
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1228
01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:09.725
Shit.

1229
01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:20.194
He ain't gonna make it.

1230
01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:24.740
Shit.

1231
01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:34.500
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1232
01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:39.463
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1233
01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:41.882
Hotel One. Over.

1234
01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.051
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1235
01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:47.513
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1236
01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:50.432
Wait, One.

1237
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.063
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1238
01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:58.107
- Continue with the patrol,
- Shit.

1239
01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:00.484
- And call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.

1240
01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:03.362
Roger. Out.

1241
01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.620
I'm squad leader.

1242
01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:17.042
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1243
01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:19.711
All right.

1244
01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.047
He's dead.

1245
01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:04.715
Cowboy.

1246
01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.764
What's up?

1247
01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:16.310
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1248
01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.854
Here, see what you think.

1249
01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.317
I think we're here...

1250
01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:27.446
and we should be here.

1251
01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:31.241
- We're here?
- Yeah.

1252
01:29:31.325 --> 01:29:34.620
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1253
01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:42.502
Fuck.

1254
01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.468
What do you think?

1255
01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:53.889
Well, I think we should change direction.

1256
01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:09.404
Okay.

1257
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:12.074
We'll change direction.

1258
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:24.336
What's up?

1259
01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:26.380
Change in direction.

1260
01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.382
What are we, lost?

1261
01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:31.593
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1262
01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:34.054
Okay, listen up.

1263
01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:36.348
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1264
01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.350
Okay, we're changing direction.

1265
01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:40.227
We're heading over that way.

1266
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:43.563
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1267
01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:46.483
- Got it?
- Got it.

1268
01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:50.195
Eightball, let's dance.

1269
01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:53.031
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1270
01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:55.677
Fuck.

1271
01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:12.819
Cease fire.

1272
01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:14.905
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1273
01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:17.616
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1274
01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:19.326
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

1275
01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:20.702
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

1276
01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:24.414
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1277
01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:26.249
Anybody see a sniper?

1278
01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:27.918
- Nothing.
- Negative.

1279
01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:30.962
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1280
01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:34.091
Eightball.

1281
01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:36.843
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1282
01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:38.720
Animal, cease fire.

1283
01:32:38.804 --> 01:32:41.014
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1284
01:32:41.098 --> 01:32:42.682
This is Cowboy. Over.

1285
01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:46.311
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1286
01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:48.772
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1287
01:32:48.855 --> 01:32:50.190
Eightball is down.

1288
01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:53.276
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1289
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.155
Believe possible, strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1290
01:32:57.239 --> 01:33:00.784
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1291
01:33:01.284 --> 01:33:02.702
Roger. Understand.

1292
01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:05.372
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1293
01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:07.916
Roger. Over and out.

1294
01:33:07.999 --> 01:33:10.335
- Stay close.
- Got it.

1295
01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:15.048
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1296
01:33:15.132 --> 01:33:18.802
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1297
01:33:18.885 --> 01:33:20.846
I've requested tank support.

1298
01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:24.266
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1299
01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:27.269
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1300
01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:32.232
Goddamn it. Halt. Cease your fire, Mother.

1301
01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:34.317
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

1302
01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:36.236
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

1303
01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:39.114
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1304
01:33:39.322 --> 01:33:41.992
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1305
01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:44.244
I seen this before.

1306
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:47.164
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1307
01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:52.669
Goddamn it. No.

1308
01:33:52.752 --> 01:33:55.755
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this--

1309
01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:58.049
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1310
01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:01.720
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.

1311
01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:22.199
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1312
01:34:22.282 --> 01:34:24.576
Cease fire.

1313
01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:37.297
Hold your fire.

1314
01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:39.508
Hold your fire.

1315
01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:42.177
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1316
01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:46.681
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1317
01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:53.939
Hold your fire.

1318
01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:57.108
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1319
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.362
Give me that fucking radio.

1320
01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:07.202
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1321
01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:08.828
This is Murphy. Over.

1322
01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:11.373
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1323
01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:14.459
What's the story on that fucking tank? Over.

1324
01:35:15.502 --> 01:35:19.005
Sorry, Cowboy. No luck so far with the tank.

1325
01:35:19.089 --> 01:35:21.424
Will advise. Over.

1326
01:35:22.425 --> 01:35:24.386
Roger. Out.

1327
01:35:24.803 --> 01:35:27.138
Numb-nut bastards.

1328
01:35:27.222 --> 01:35:30.350
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1329
01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:33.353
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1330
01:35:33.436 --> 01:35:35.438
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1331
01:35:35.522 --> 01:35:37.816
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1332
01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:40.944
We gotta do it now. Let's get ready to move.

1333
01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:43.321
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

1334
01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:47.534
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one fucking sniper out there.

1335
01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:49.035
Back off, Mother.

1336
01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:52.122
I'm calling the plays. I say we're pulling out.

1337
01:35:52.205 --> 01:35:54.082
Yeah, well, what about
Doc Jay and Eightball?

1338
01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:58.044
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1339
01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:00.547
Yeah, we're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1340
01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:02.549
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1341
01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:05.427
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1342
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:08.013
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1343
01:36:08.096 --> 01:36:10.557
Stand down, Mother. That's a direct order.

1344
01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:18.898
Fuck you, Cowboy. Fuck all you assholes.

1345
01:36:21.026 --> 01:36:24.070
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1346
01:36:24.154 --> 01:36:26.906
You motherfucker.

1347
01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:45.300
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1348
01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:49.054
Where's the sniper?

1349
01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:55.226
Doc, where's the sniper?

1350
01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:05.654
Shit.

1351
01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:09.783
Shit. Fuck.

1352
01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:25.715
Fuck.

1353
01:37:57.372 --> 01:37:59.499
Hey, Cowboy.

1354
01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:01.626
Yeah?

1355
01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.964
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1356
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:10.093
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1357
01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:14.305
Move up the squad, you're clear up to here.

1358
01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.641
Come on.

1359
01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:21.479
Son of a bitch.

1360
01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:27.819
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1361
01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.074
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1362
01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:35.952
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1363
01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:38.872
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1364
01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:42.125
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

1365
01:38:42.208 --> 01:38:44.127
Okay.

1366
01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:45.962
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1367
01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:47.130
Let's move out.

1368
01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:48.840
Let's do it.

1369
01:39:26.753 --> 01:39:28.129
Hey, Cowboy.

1370
01:39:28.213 --> 01:39:30.757
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1371
01:39:50.527 --> 01:39:53.238
Donlon, give me that radio.

1372
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.492
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1373
01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:10.380
- Cowboy.
- That sniper's got a clean shot.

1374
01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:11.840
Get him out of here.

1375
01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.933
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

1376
01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:24.185
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

1377
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:25.979
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

1378
01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:27.480
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

1379
01:40:27.564 --> 01:40:29.482
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

1380
01:40:29.566 --> 01:40:32.485
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

1381
01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:36.281
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1382
01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:38.116
Come on. Easy.

1383
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:39.617
Here you go.

1384
01:40:41.327 --> 01:40:45.248
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

1385
01:40:49.085 --> 01:40:52.130
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1386
01:40:58.177 --> 01:41:01.639
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

1387
01:41:57.695 --> 01:42:00.239
Let's go get some payback.

1388
01:42:06.162 --> 01:42:07.747
Okay.

1389
01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:15.630
Okay.

1390
01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:25.181
Watch that fucking hole.

1391
01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:27.684
Throw some smoke.

1392
01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.994
Okay, ready?

1393
01:43:26.993 --> 01:43:30.747
Donlon, Rock, that way. You two, with me.

1394
01:43:35.793 --> 01:43:38.463
Joker, in there. New guy.

1395
01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:45.423
We got the sniper!

1396
01:46:19.123 --> 01:46:20.625
Joker?

1397
01:46:21.167 --> 01:46:22.668
Yo.

1398
01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:24.587
What's up?

1399
01:46:26.047 --> 01:46:28.216
We got the sniper.

1400
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:42.772
I saved Joker's ass.

1401
01:46:42.855 --> 01:46:44.732
I got the sniper.

1402
01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:47.526
I fucking blew her away.

1403
01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:50.321
Am I bad?

1404
01:46:50.947 --> 01:46:54.951
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1405
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:14.679
What's she saying?

1406
01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:20.142
She's praying.

1407
01:47:24.021 --> 01:47:27.316
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1408
01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:32.655
There's nothing we can do for her.

1409
01:47:34.198 --> 01:47:36.325
She's dead meat.

1410
01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:42.206
Okay.

1411
01:47:43.541 --> 01:47:45.710
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1412
01:47:50.214 --> 01:47:52.049
What about her?

1413
01:47:55.845 --> 01:47:57.513
Fuck her.

1414
01:47:58.848 --> 01:48:00.558
Let her rot.

1415
01:48:16.866 --> 01:48:19.201
We can't just leave her here.

1416
01:48:22.413 --> 01:48:24.290
Hey, asshole.

1417
01:48:24.749 --> 01:48:27.001
Cowboy's wasted.

1418
01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.046
You're fresh out of friends.

1419
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:33.007
I'm running this squad now,

1420
01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:37.428
and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1421
01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:44.310
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1422
01:48:46.145 --> 01:48:50.107
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1423
01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:02.620
Shoot me.

1424
01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:06.582
Shoot...

1425
01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:08.667
me.

1426
01:49:09.251 --> 01:49:11.337
Shoot...

1427
01:49:11.837 --> 01:49:13.464
me.

1428
01:49:13.923 --> 01:49:15.925
Shoot.

1429
01:49:17.593 --> 01:49:19.303
Shoot.

1430
01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:23.808
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1431
01:49:25.643 --> 01:49:27.812
waste her.

1432
01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:29.563
Shoot...

1433
01:49:31.732 --> 01:49:33.150
me.

1434
01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:40.032
Shoot me.

1435
01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:43.202
Shoot...

1436
01:49:44.495 --> 01:49:46.205
me.

1437
01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:48.666
Shoot...

1438
01:49:49.375 --> 01:49:50.835
me.

1439
01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:53.629
Shoot.

1440
01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:57.299
Shoot.

1441
01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:02.471
Shoot.

1442
01:50:03.472 --> 01:50:05.057
Shoot.

1443
01:50:42.386 --> 01:50:44.263
Joker,

1444
01:50:44.346 --> 01:50:49.143
we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1445
01:50:52.897 --> 01:50:55.065
Hard-core, man.

1446
01:50:57.067 --> 01:50:59.570
