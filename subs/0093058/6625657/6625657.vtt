11
00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.420
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

12
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.658
From now on, you will speak
only when spoken to...

13
00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.684
and the first and
last words out of

14
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.430
your filthy sewers will be "sir."

15
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.470
Do you maggots understand that?

16
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.868
Sir, yes, sir.

17
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.341
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

18
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.877
Sir, yes, sir.

19
00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:58.404
If you ladies leave my island, if
you survive recruit training...

20
00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.916
you will be a weapon.

21
00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:03.112
You will be a minister of
death praying for war.

22
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.087
But until that day, you are pukes.

23
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.625
You are the lowest
form of life on Earth.

24
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.161
You are not even
human-fucking-beings.

25
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.567
You are nothing but unorganised,

26
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:16.223
grabasstic pieces
of amphibian shit.

27
00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.269
Because I am hard, you
will not like me.

28
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.135
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

29
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.401
I am hard but I am fair.

30
00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.841
There is no racial bigotry here.

31
00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:31.143
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

32
00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.808
Here, you are all
equally worthless.

33
00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.945
And my orders are to weed
out all non-hackers...

34
00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.956
who do not pack the gear to
serve in my beloved Corps.

35
00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.117
Do you maggots understand that?

36
00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.523
Sir, yes, sir.

37
00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.425
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

38
00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.589
Sir, yes, sir.

39
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.032
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir.

40
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.760
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

41
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.272
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir.

42
00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.138
Well, there's one thing that
you won't like, Snowball:

43
00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.473
They don't serve fried
chicken and watermelon...

44
00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.741
on a daily basis in my mess hall.

45
00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.407
Sir, yes, sir.

46
00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.147
Is that you, John
Wayne? Is this me?

47
00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.017
Who said that?

48
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.147
Who the fuck said that?

49
00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.101
Who's the slimy little
communist-shit,

50
00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:16.784
twinkle-toed cocksucker
down here...

51
00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.591
who just signed his
own death warrant?

52
00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:21.958
Nobody, huh?

53
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:25.832
The fairy-fucking-godmother
said it. Out-fucking-standing.

54
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.599
I will P. T. You all
until you fucking die.

55
00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.539
I'll P. T. You until your
assholes are sucking buttermilk.

56
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.750
Was it you, you
scroungy little fuck?

57
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:34.757
Sir, no, sir.

58
00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:37.944
You piece of shit. You look like a
fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

59
00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.473
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

60
00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:45.345
Well, no shit.

61
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.858
What have we got here? A fucking
comedian. Private Joker.

62
00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.916
I admire your honesty.

63
00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.928
Hell, I like you.
You can come over

64
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:54.555
to my house and fuck my sister.

65
00:03:56.202 --> 00:04:00.434
You little scumbag. I've got
your name. I've got your ass.

66
00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.632
You will not laugh.
You will not cry.

67
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.039
You will learn by the
numbers. I will teach you.

68
00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.776
Now get up. Get on your feet.

69
00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.556
You best unfuck yourself
or I will unscrew

70
00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:12.680
your head and shit down your neck.

71
00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:13.732
Sir, yes, sir.

72
00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:16.208
Private Joker, why did
you join my Corps?

73
00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.448
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

74
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.480
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

75
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.050
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

76
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:29.062
That's a war face. Now let
me see your war face.

77
00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.763
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

78
00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.530
You don't scare me. Work on it.

79
00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.301
Sir, yes, sir.

80
00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:39.740
What's your excuse?

81
00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.277
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

82
00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.280
I'm asking the fucking questions,
private. Do you understand?

83
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.475
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

84
00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.213
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

85
00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.493
Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?

86
00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:52.517
Sir, I am, sir.

87
00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.751
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

88
00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.623
Sir what? Were you about
to call me an asshole?

89
00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.129
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

90
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.790
Sir, 5'9", sir.

91
00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.732
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

92
00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.202
You trying to squeeze an
inch in on me somewhere?

93
00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.421
Sir, no, sir.

94
00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:10.365
Bullshit. It looks like
the best part of you...

95
00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.527
ran down the crack of
your mama's ass and

96
00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:14.274
ended up as a stain
on the mattress.

97
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.777
I think you've been cheated.

98
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.046
Where the hell are
you from, private?

99
00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.708
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

100
00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.947
Only steers and queers come
from Texas, Private Cowboy.

101
00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.937
And you don't much
look like a steer to

102
00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:27.615
me, so that kind of
narrows it down.

103
00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.785
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

104
00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.260
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

105
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.855
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

106
00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.849
and not even have
the goddamn common

107
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.663
courtesy to give him
a reach around.

108
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.931
I'll be watching you.

109
00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.701
Did your parents have any
children that lived?

110
00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.107
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

111
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.204
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

112
00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.977
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

113
00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.847
Lawrence? Lawrence
what, of Arabia?

114
00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:55.928
Sir, no, sir.

115
00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:58.650
That name sounds like
royalty. You royalty?

116
00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.781
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

117
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.991
Sir, no, sir.

118
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.884
Bullshit. I'll bet you
could suck a golf ball...

119
00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:06.019
- through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

120
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.632
I don't like the name Lawrence.

121
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.927
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

122
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.731
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

123
00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.567
Do you think I'm cute, Private
Pyle? You think I'm funny?

124
00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:16.829
Sir, no, sir.

125
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.836
Wipe that disgusting
grin off your face.

126
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.899
Sir, yes, sir.

127
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.207
Well, any-fucking-time,
sweetheart.

128
00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:24.781
Sir, I'm trying, sir.

129
00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:27.073
Private Pyle, I'll give
you three seconds...

130
00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.346
exactly three fucking seconds...

131
00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:32.082
to wipe that stupid-looking
grin off your face...

132
00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:36.251
or I will gouge out your
eyeballs and skull-fuck you.

133
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.954
One. Two. Three.

134
00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.011
Sir, I can't help it, sir.

135
00:06:41.012 --> 00:06:43.762
Bullshit. Get on
your knees, scumbag.

136
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.468
Now choke yourself.

137
00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:51.700
Goddamn it, with my
hand, numb-nuts.

138
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:55.906
Don't pull my fucking hand over
there. I said, choke yourself.

139
00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.915
Now lean forward and
choke yourself.

140
00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:04.914
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

141
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.649
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

142
00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.024
Sir, yes, sir.

143
00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:13.017
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

144
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.996
Sir, yes, sir.

145
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:18.057
That's enough. Get on your feet.

146
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.447
Pyle, you had best
square your ass away and

147
00:07:23.448 --> 00:07:25.636
start shitting me
Tiffany cuff links...

148
00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.406
or I will definitely fuck you up.

149
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.537
Sir, yes, sir.

150
00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:35.141
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

151
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.653
Left, right, left, right, left.

152
00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.451
Left, right, left, right, left...

153
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.253
Parris Island, South Carolina...

154
00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:45.659
the United States Marine
Corps Recruit Depot.

155
00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:49.461
An eight-week college for the
phoney-tough and the crazy-brave.

156
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.468
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

157
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.402
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

158
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.408
Mama rolled over And
this is what she said

159
00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.944
Mama rolled over,
this is what she said

160
00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.037
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

161
00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.514
- P. T.
- P. T.

162
00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.016
- P. T.
- P. T.

163
00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:08.517
- Good for you
- Good for you

164
00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:10.178
- And good for me
- And good for me

165
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.620
- Good
- Good

166
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.521
Up in the morning
to the rising sun

167
00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:17.185
Up in the morning
to the rising sun

168
00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:20.127
going to run all day
till the running's done

169
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.427
going to run all day
till the running's done

170
00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:26.436
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

171
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:29.029
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

172
00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:32.097
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

173
00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.338
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

174
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:39.042
Left, right, left, right, left.

175
00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:42.142
Your left shoulder.

176
00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:46.183
Left, right, left. Port.

177
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.159
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

178
00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:55.027
Left shoulder.

179
00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.868
Private Pyle, what are you trying
to do to my beloved Corps?

180
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.565
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle...

181
00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:05.494
but do you expect
me to believe that

182
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:07.008
you don't know left from right?

183
00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.545
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

184
00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.604
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

185
00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.548
What side was that, Private Pyle?

186
00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:15.674
Sir, left side, sir.

187
00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:19.382
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

188
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.696
What side was that, Private Pyle?

189
00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:23.120
Sir, right side, sir.

190
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.662
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

191
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.458
Pick up your fucking cover.

192
00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:28.861
Sir, yes, sir.

193
00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.868
Your left shoulder.

194
00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:36.103
Left, right, left. Port.

195
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.137
Left shoulder.

196
00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:44.638
Your right shoulder.

197
00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:50.808
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

198
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.719
Left, two, three, four.

199
00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:57.419
Your right shoulder.

200
00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:04.192
Tonight you pukes will
sleep with your rifles.

201
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.862
You will give your
rifle a girl's name.

202
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.239
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

203
00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:17.872
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

204
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.214
through her purty pink
panties are over.

205
00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.447
You're married to this piece.

206
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.286
This weapon of iron and wood.

207
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.657
And you will be faithful.

208
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.193
Arms.

209
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.565
Prepare to mount.

210
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.098
Mount.

211
00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.472
Port.

212
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.548
Pray.

213
00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.280
This is my rifle.

214
00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:01.949
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

215
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.790
My rifle is my best friend.

216
00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.625
It is my life.

217
00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:11.088
I must master it as I
must master my life.

218
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.228
Without me, my rifle is useless.

219
00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:17.262
Without my rifle, I am useless.

220
00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.307
I must fire my rifle true.

221
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:24.506
I must shoot straighter than my
enemy, who is trying to kill me.

222
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.642
I must shoot him
before he shoots me.

223
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.344
I will.

224
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:32.184
Before God, I swear this creed.

225
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:36.055
My rifle and myself are
defenders of my country.

226
00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:38.492
We are the masters of our enemy.

227
00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.155
We are the saviours of my life.

228
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.532
So be it until there is
no enemy, but peace.

229
00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.400
Amen.

230
00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:49.734
Arm.

231
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.207
At ease.

232
00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.605
Good night, ladies.

233
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.412
Good night, sir.

234
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.380
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

235
00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.711
Right shoulder.

236
00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:14.484
That is not your daddy's
shotgun, Cowboy.

237
00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.866
Left shoulder.

238
00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:26.534
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

239
00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.210
Port.

240
00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:37.047
Four inches from your
chest, Pyle. Four inches.

241
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:40.183
This is my rifle, this is my gun

242
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.850
This is for fighting,
this is for fun

243
00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:45.451
This is my rifle, this is my gun

244
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.020
This is for fighting,
this is for fun

245
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.691
This is my rifle, this is my gun

246
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.293
This is for fighting,
this is for fun

247
00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.895
This is my rifle, this is my gun

248
00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:58.498
This is for fighting,
this is for fun

249
00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:01.043
This is my rifle, this is my gun

250
00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:03.977
This is for fighting,
this is for fun

251
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.884
You're bouncing.

252
00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:27.934
T en fucking seconds.

253
00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.751
It should take you no
less than 10 fucking

254
00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:32.965
seconds to negotiate
this obstacle.

255
00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.635
Quickly, move it out.

256
00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.621
There ain't one
swinging-dick private

257
00:13:36.622 --> 00:13:38.442
in this platoon's
going to graduate...

258
00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.900
until they can get
this obstacle down

259
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:42.883
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

260
00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:08.369
Next two privates. Quickly.

261
00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.311
Get over that goddamn
obstacle. Move it.

262
00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.542
Next two privates. Quickly.

263
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.084
Hurry up. Get up there.

264
00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.950
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

265
00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:19.988
Let me hear your war cry.

266
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.890
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

267
00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.190
Get your fat ass over
there, Private Pyle.

268
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.094
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

269
00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.161
Don't make any fucking
effort to get

270
00:14:30.162 --> 00:14:32.158
up to the top of the
fucking obstacle.

271
00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.585
If God wanted you up
there, he would have

272
00:14:34.586 --> 00:14:36.832
miracled your ass up
by now, wouldn't he?

273
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:39.739
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

274
00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:42.107
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?

275
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.357
I'll bet if there was
some pussy up there on

276
00:14:44.358 --> 00:14:46.479
top of that obstacle,
you could get up there.

277
00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.347
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

278
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.701
Your ass looks like
about 150 pounds of

279
00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:52.718
chewed bubble gum.
Do you know that?

280
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.325
Sir, yes, sir.

281
00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.061
One for the commandant.

282
00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.258
One for the Corps.

283
00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:06.199
Get up there. Pull.

284
00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:10.070
I guess the Corps don't get
theirs. Get up there, Pyle.

285
00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:13.268
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

286
00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.970
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

287
00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:19.743
You got to be shitting me,
Pyle. Get your ass up there.

288
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.582
Do you mean to tell me that you
cannot do one single pull-up?

289
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:28.113
You are a worthless piece of
shit, Pyle. Get out of my face.

290
00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.285
Get up there, Snowball.

291
00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.092
Get up here, fat-boy.

292
00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:36.530
Quickly. Move it up. Move
it up, Pyle. Move it up.

293
00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.744
You climb obstacles
like old people

294
00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:40.900
fuck. Do you know
that, Private Pyle?

295
00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:44.372
Get up here. You're too
slow. Move it. Move it.

296
00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:48.070
Private Pyle, whatever
you do, don't fall down.

297
00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:50.442
That would break my fucking heart.

298
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:54.074
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

299
00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:57.780
Well, what in the fuck are you
waiting for, Private Pyle?

300
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.688
Get up and over. Move
it, move it, move it.

301
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.385
Are you quitting on me?

302
00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.588
Well, are you?

303
00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:11.054
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

304
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.727
Get the fuck off my obstacle.

305
00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.636
Get the fuck down off my obstacle.

306
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.004
Now. Move it.

307
00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.758
I'm going to rip your
balls off so you

308
00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.536
cannot contaminate the
rest of the world.

309
00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.345
I will motivate you,
Private Pyle...

310
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:32.115
if it short-dicks every
cannibal on the Congo.

311
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.719
Pick them up and set
them down, Pyle.

312
00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.953
Quickly. Move it out.

313
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.494
Were you born a fat,
slimy, scumbag

314
00:16:40.495 --> 00:16:42.726
puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

315
00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:45.233
Or did you have to work on it?

316
00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:48.999
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

317
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.428
The fucking war will
be over by the time

318
00:16:51.429 --> 00:16:53.736
we get out there, won't
it, Private Pyle?

319
00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.470
Move it.

320
00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:59.811
Are you going to fucking die,
Pyle? Are you going to die on me?

321
00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:02.010
Do it now.

322
00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:05.645
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

323
00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:09.285
Do you feel dizzy?

324
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:11.793
Do you feel faint?

325
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.491
Jesus H. Christ, I think
you've got a hard-on.

326
00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:23.130
Quickly, ladies. Assholes
and elbows. Move it out.

327
00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.832
Get up here.

328
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.673
Move it. Move it,
move it, move it.

329
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.805
Quickly.

330
00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:34.771
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

331
00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:51.033
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

332
00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.068
Drop your cocks and
grab your socks.

333
00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:56.127
Today is Sunday. Divine
worship at 08:00.

334
00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.697
Get your bunks made and
get your uniforms on.

335
00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:01.801
Police call will
commence in two minutes.

336
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.379
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

337
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.107
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

338
00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.016
As soon as you
finish your bunks, I

339
00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:08.845
want you two turds
to clean the head.

340
00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:12.081
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary...

341
00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.288
that the Virgin Mary
herself would be

342
00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:16.318
proud to go in there
and take a dump.

343
00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:17.860
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

344
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.260
Private Joker, do you
believe in the Virgin Mary?

345
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.229
Sir, no, sir.

346
00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:29.100
Well, Private Joker, I don't
believe I heard you correctly.

347
00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:31.469
Sir, the private said,
"No, sir," sir.

348
00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:34.806
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

349
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.062
You goddamn communist
heathen. Sound

350
00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:39.144
off that you love
the Virgin Mary...

351
00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.513
or I'm going to stomp
your guts out.

352
00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:44.019
Now, you do love the
Virgin Mary, don't you?

353
00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:45.451
Sir, negative, sir.

354
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.115
Private Joker, are you
trying to offend me?

355
00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:49.624
Sir, negative, sir.

356
00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.855
Sir, the private believes that any
answer he gives will be wrong...

357
00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:55.024
and the senior drill
instructor will beat

358
00:18:55.025 --> 00:18:56.922
him harder if he
reverses himself, sir.

359
00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:58.660
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

360
00:18:58.837 --> 00:19:01.670
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

361
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.728
Private Snowball.

362
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.537
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

363
00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.684
Private Snowball,
you're fired. Private

364
00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:10.409
Joker is promoted to squad leader.

365
00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:13.005
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

366
00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:15.915
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

367
00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:18.235
Sir, Private Pyle reporting
as ordered, sir.

368
00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.252
From now on...

369
00:19:19.253 --> 00:19:22.490
Private Joker is your new squad
leader and you will bunk with him.

370
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.958
He'll teach you everything.

371
00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.324
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

372
00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.648
Private Joker is silly
and he's ignorant,

373
00:19:28.649 --> 00:19:30.594
but he's got guts
and guts is enough.

374
00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.498
Now, you ladies, carry on.

375
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.866
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

376
00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:44.838
The bolt. The bolt
goes in the receiver.

377
00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.583
Operating-rod handle.

378
00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.247
Operating-rod guide.

379
00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:56.890
And the left one over the right.

380
00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:59.155
Right one over the left.

381
00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.831
Left one over the right.

382
00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:06.266
The right one over the left.

383
00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:12.072
Just throw your other leg over.

384
00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.576
Attaboy.

385
00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:24.643
That's it. Now just pull the next
one over and you're home free.

386
00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:27.149
Ready?

387
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.153
Just throw it over.

388
00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:42.801
Attaboy.

389
00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:44.939
Set it down.

390
00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:49.269
All right?

391
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.303
There you go.

392
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.114
Congratulations, Leonard.

393
00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.880
You did it.

394
00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:01.682
Fold the blanket and the
sheet back together.

395
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.192
Make a four-inch fold.

396
00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:07.057
Okay? Got it?

397
00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:09.120
You do it.

398
00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.994
Right shoulder.

399
00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:15.264
Your left shoulder.

400
00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.439
Port.

401
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.747
Order.

402
00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:52.266
Your right shoulder.

403
00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.274
Square these weapons away.

404
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.305
My Corps' arms should
be parallel to the...

405
00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.751
The deadliest weapon
in the world...

406
00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:10.782
is a Marine and his rifle.

407
00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:14.454
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

408
00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:18.694
if you expect to
survive in combat.

409
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.397
Your rifle is only a tool.

410
00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:25.134
It is a hard heart that kills.

411
00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:30.768
If your killer instincts are
not clean and strong...

412
00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:33.975
you will hesitate at
the moment of truth.

413
00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:36.143
You will not kill.

414
00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.687
You will become dead-Marine.

415
00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:42.190
And then you will be
in a world of shit.

416
00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.090
Because Marines...

417
00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:47.857
are not allowed to die
without permission.

418
00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.694
Do you maggots understand?

419
00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.392
Sir, yes, sir.

420
00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:55.769
I love working for Uncle Sam

421
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.705
I love working for Uncle Sam

422
00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:01.641
Lets me know just who I am

423
00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:04.611
Lets me know just who I am

424
00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:07.616
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

425
00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:10.619
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

426
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:13.622
One, two, three, four I
love the Marine Corps

427
00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:16.625
One, two, three, four I
love the Marine Corps

428
00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.126
My Corps - My Corps

429
00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:19.627
- Your Corps

430
00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.095
- Our Corps

432
00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:25.701
I don't know, but I've been told

433
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.726
I don't know, but I've been told

434
00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.671
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

435
00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:34.641
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

436
00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.144
- Good
- Good

437
00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:37.679
- Feels good
- Feels good

438
00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.146
- Is good
- Is good

439
00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:40.648
- Real good
- Real good

440
00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.150
- Tastes good

441
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.685
- Mighty good

442
00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.186
- Good for you

443
00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.756
- Good for me
- Good for me

444
00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:50.851
Trim them.

445
00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:55.595
Toe jam.

446
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.335
Pop that blister.

447
00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:11.903
Jesus H. Christ.

448
00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:16.082
Private Pyle, why is your
footlocker unlocked?

449
00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:17.414
Sir, I don't know, sir.

450
00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:21.047
Private Pyle, if there is one
thing in this world that I hate...

451
00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:24.395
it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

452
00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:25.402
Sir, yes, sir.

453
00:24:25.403 --> 00:24:27.256
If it wasn't for
dickheads like you...

454
00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:29.992
there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

455
00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.124
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

456
00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:40.330
Well, now, let's just see if
there's anything missing.

457
00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:45.109
Holy Jesus.

458
00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:47.080
What is that?

459
00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:49.846
What the fuck is that?

460
00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:51.716
What is that, Private Pyle?

461
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.152
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

462
00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.691
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

463
00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:56.897
How did it get here?

464
00:24:56.898 --> 00:24:58.921
Sir, I took it from
the mess hall, sir.

465
00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:01.224
Is chow allowed in the
barracks, Private Pyle?

466
00:25:01.364 --> 00:25:02.364
Sir, no, sir.

467
00:25:02.365 --> 00:25:05.130
Are you allowed to eat jelly
doughnuts, Private Pyle?

468
00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.669
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

469
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.500
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

470
00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:13.228
Because you are a disgusting
fat-body, Private Pyle?

471
00:25:13.229 --> 00:25:14.702
Sir, yes, sir.

472
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.782
Then why did you hide
a jelly doughnut

473
00:25:16.783 --> 00:25:18.441
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

474
00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.573
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

475
00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.846
Because you were hungry.

476
00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:31.047
Private Pyle has
dishonoured himself...

477
00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:33.857
and dishonoured the platoon.

478
00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:37.991
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

479
00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:43.061
I have failed because
you have not helped me.

480
00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:47.302
You people have not
given Private Pyle...

481
00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.674
the proper motivation.

482
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:55.342
So from now on, whenever
Private Pyle fucks up...

483
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.784
I will not punish him.

484
00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.447
I will punish all of you.

485
00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:02.685
And the way I see it, ladies...

486
00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:05.921
you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

487
00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:08.793
Now get on your faces.

488
00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.930
Open your mouth.

489
00:26:12.103 --> 00:26:14.594
They're paying for it, you eat it.

490
00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:17.139
Ready, exercise.

491
00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:19.937
One, two, three, four

492
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.602
I love the Marine Corps

493
00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:25.147
One, two, three, four

494
00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.706
I love the Marine Corps

495
00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:30.309
One, two, three, four

496
00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:32.820
I love the Marine Corps

497
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.482
One, two, three, four

498
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.992
I love the Marine Corps

499
00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:40.529
One, two, three, four...

500
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.724
You really look like
shit today, Leonard.

501
00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.805
Joker.

502
00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.977
Everybody hates me now.

503
00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:02.383
Even you.

504
00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:07.755
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

505
00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:10.421
You just keep making mistakes.

506
00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.893
Getting everybody in trouble.

507
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.360
I can't do anything right.

508
00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.794
I need help.

509
00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:28.676
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

510
00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.542
I'm really trying.

511
00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.846
Tuck your shirt in.

512
00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:43.248
One, two, three, 19.

513
00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:45.453
One, two, three, 20.

514
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.689
One, two, three, 21.

515
00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:49.891
One, two, three, 22.

516
00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.990
One, two, three, 23.

517
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.195
One, two, three, 24.

518
00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.363
One, two, three, 25.

519
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.429
One, two, three, 26.

520
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.635
One, two, three, 27.

521
00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.803
One, two, three, 28.

522
00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.903
One, two, three, 29.

523
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.574
One, two, three, 30.

524
00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.861
Do it.

525
00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:36.234
Do it.

526
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.713
Remember, it's just a
bad dream, fat-boy.

527
00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.846
Port.

528
00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:23.076
Left shoulder.

529
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:28.087
Right shoulder.

530
00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:33.254
Port.

531
00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:39.223
Do we love our beloved
Corps, ladies?

532
00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:43.727
Semper fi, do or die. Gung
ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

533
00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:46.035
What makes the grass grow?

534
00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:48.176
Blood, blood, blood.

535
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:51.076
What do we do for
a living, ladies?

536
00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.944
Kill, kill, kill.

537
00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.709
I can't hear you.

538
00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.581
Kill, kill, kill.

539
00:30:56.754 --> 00:30:59.814
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

540
00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.618
Kill, kill, kill.

541
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.326
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

542
00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:10.323
None of you dumb-asses knows?

543
00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.663
Private Cowboy.

544
00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:14.864
Sir, he was that guy
who shot all those

545
00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:17.194
people from that tower
in Austin, Texas, sir.

546
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:20.208
That's affirmative. Charles
Whitman killed 12 people...

547
00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:24.576
from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

548
00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:27.638
From distances of up to 400 yards.

549
00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:31.651
Anybody know who Lee
Harvey Oswald was?

550
00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:32.881
Private Snowball.

551
00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:35.387
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

552
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.393
That's right. And do you
know how far away he was?

553
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:42.886
Sir, he was pretty far. From that
book-suppository building, sir.

554
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.023
All right, knock it off.

555
00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:47.091
Two hundred and fifty feet.

556
00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:51.470
He was 250 feet away and
shooting at a moving target.

557
00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:54.662
Oswald got off three
rounds with an old Italian

558
00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:57.240
bolt-action rifle in
only six seconds...

559
00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:00.873
and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

560
00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:03.281
Do any of you people
know where these

561
00:32:03.282 --> 00:32:05.216
individuals learnt how to shoot?

562
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.751
Private Joker.

563
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.848
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

564
00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.553
In the Marines. Outstanding.

565
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.972
Those individuals showed what one

566
00:32:14.973 --> 00:32:17.690
motivated Marine and
his rifle can do.

567
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.429
And before you ladies
leave my island...

568
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.938
you will all be able
to do the same thing.

569
00:32:25.237 --> 00:32:29.408
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

570
00:32:29.492 --> 00:32:33.746
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

571
00:32:33.829 --> 00:32:38.834
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jesus ♪

572
00:32:38.918 --> 00:32:43.547
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

573
00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.690
Today...

574
00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:48.024
is Christmas.

575
00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:53.398
There will be a
magic show at 09:30.

576
00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:57.332
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

577
00:32:57.508 --> 00:33:02.070
about how the free world
will conquer communism...

578
00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:06.876
with the aid of God
and a few Marines.

579
00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:11.343
God has a hard-on for Marines...

580
00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:16.186
because we kill everything we see.

581
00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.750
He plays his games...

582
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.626
we play ours.

583
00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:26.657
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

584
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:32.196
we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

585
00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:36.936
God was here before
the Marine Corps.

586
00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:40.107
So you can give your
heart to Jesus...

587
00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:43.981
but your ass belongs to the Corps.

588
00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.111
Do you ladies understand?

589
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.282
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

590
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.291
Sir, yes, sir.

591
00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:00.367
It's been swabbed and brushed.

592
00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.536
Everything...

593
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:06.273
is clean.

594
00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.944
Beautiful.

595
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:16.179
So that it slides perfect.

596
00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:19.784
Nice.

597
00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.254
Everything clean.

598
00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:26.688
Oiled.

599
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:31.922
So that your action is beautiful.

600
00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:38.137
Smooth Charlene.

601
00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:02.889
Leonard talks to his rifle.

602
00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:06.763
Yeah.

603
00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:17.205
I don't think Leonard
can hack it any more.

604
00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:21.145
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

605
00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.677
It don't surprise me.

606
00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:40.567
I wanna slip my tube
steak into your sister.

607
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.836
What will you take in trade?

608
00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.967
What do you got?

609
00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.222
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

610
00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:09.093
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

611
00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:11.132
Sir, yes, sir.

612
00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.302
What's your sixth general order?

613
00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.965
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

614
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.533
and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

615
00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.475
all orders...

616
00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:25.411
Sir, the private's
sixth general...

617
00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:28.005
The private has been
instructed but does not know.

618
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.451
You slimy scumbag, get on
your face and give me 25.

619
00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:33.715
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

620
00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.294
How many counts in that
movement you just executed?

621
00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:41.548
Sir, four counts, sir.

622
00:36:41.549 --> 00:36:43.627
What's the idea of
looking in the chamber?

623
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.910
Sir, to guarantee the
private is not giving

624
00:36:45.911 --> 00:36:48.067
the inspecting officer
a loaded weapon, sir.

625
00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.729
What's your fifth general order?

626
00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.871
Sir, the fifth general
order is to quit

627
00:36:51.872 --> 00:36:53.934
my post only when
properly relieved, sir.

628
00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.908
What's this weapon's
name, Private Pyle?

629
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.913
Sir, the private's weapon's
name is Charlene, sir.

630
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:01.847
Private Pyle, you are
definitely born-again hard.

631
00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.842
Hell, I may even
allow you to serve

632
00:37:03.843 --> 00:37:05.614
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

633
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.883
Sir, yes, sir.

634
00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.990
I don't want no teenage queen

635
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.758
I don't want no teenage queen

636
00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:18.595
I just want my M14

637
00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:21.363
I just want my M14

638
00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.235
If I die in a combat zone

639
00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.968
If I die in a combat zone

640
00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:29.704
Box me up and ship me home

641
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.508
Box me up and ship me home

642
00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:35.311
Pin my medals upon my chest

643
00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:38.080
Pin my medals upon my chest

644
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.850
Tell my mum I done my best

645
00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:43.924
Tell my mum I done my best

646
00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:49.032
Graduation is only
a few days away...

647
00:37:49.207 --> 00:37:53.769
and the recruits of
Platoon 3092 are salty.

648
00:37:53.945 --> 00:37:57.904
They are ready to eat their
own guts and ask for seconds.

649
00:37:58.483 --> 00:38:01.096
The drill instructors
are proud to see

650
00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:03.910
that we are growing
beyond their control.

651
00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:07.679
The Marine Corps does
not want robots.

652
00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:10.817
The Marine Corps wants killers.

653
00:38:10.996 --> 00:38:14.762
The Marine Corps wants to
build indestructible men.

654
00:38:14.933 --> 00:38:17.731
Men without fear.

655
00:38:19.805 --> 00:38:24.265
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

656
00:38:25.811 --> 00:38:29.406
Today, you are Marines.

657
00:38:29.981 --> 00:38:32.814
You're part of a brotherhood.

658
00:38:32.984 --> 00:38:37.080
From now on, until
the day you die...

659
00:38:37.255 --> 00:38:39.553
wherever you are...

660
00:38:39.725 --> 00:38:43.217
every Marine is your brother.

661
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:47.423
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

662
00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:50.830
Some of you will not come back.

663
00:38:51.002 --> 00:38:53.197
But always remember this:

664
00:38:53.371 --> 00:38:55.236
Marines die.

665
00:38:55.407 --> 00:38:57.932
That's what we're here for.

666
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.204
But the Marine Corps
lives forever...

667
00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:06.112
and that means you live forever.

668
00:39:09.988 --> 00:39:11.649
- Peckett.
- Sir, yes, sir.

669
00:39:11.823 --> 00:39:13.484
0300, Infantry.

670
00:39:13.658 --> 00:39:15.250
- Toe Jam.
- Sir, yes, sir.

671
00:39:15.427 --> 00:39:17.292
0300, Infantry.

672
00:39:17.462 --> 00:39:19.157
- Adams.
- Sir, yes, sir.

673
00:39:19.331 --> 00:39:21.026
1800, Engineers.

674
00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:22.723
You go out and find mines.

675
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:24.698
- Cowboy.
- Sir, yes, sir.

676
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.735
0300, Infantry.

677
00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:28.304
- Taylor.
- Sir, yes, sir.

678
00:39:28.473 --> 00:39:30.270
0300, Infantry.

679
00:39:30.442 --> 00:39:32.034
- Joker.
- Sir, yes, sir.

680
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.338
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

681
00:39:35.514 --> 00:39:37.573
You got to be shitting me, Joker.

682
00:39:37.749 --> 00:39:39.273
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

683
00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:41.476
You think you're some
kind of fucking writer?

684
00:39:41.653 --> 00:39:44.076
Sir, I wrote for my high
school newspaper, sir.

685
00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:47.919
Jesus H. Christ. You're not
a writer, you're a killer.

686
00:39:48.093 --> 00:39:49.321
A killer, yes, sir.

687
00:39:49.494 --> 00:39:51.052
Gomer Pyle.

688
00:39:51.229 --> 00:39:53.823
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

689
00:39:53.999 --> 00:39:57.924
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

690
00:39:58.103 --> 00:40:00.230
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

691
00:40:04.409 --> 00:40:07.242
Our last night on the island.

692
00:40:07.412 --> 00:40:09.937
I draw fire watch.

693
00:41:12.744 --> 00:41:15.872
Hi, Joker.

694
00:41:37.869 --> 00:41:41.396
Are those live rounds?

695
00:41:47.412 --> 00:41:51.234
Seven-six-two millimetre.

696
00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:56.274
Full metal jacket.

697
00:42:04.863 --> 00:42:06.785
Leonard...

698
00:42:06.965 --> 00:42:10.822
if Hartman comes in
here and catches us...

699
00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:15.063
we'll both be in a world of shit.

700
00:42:18.343 --> 00:42:20.641
I am...

701
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.369
in a world...

702
00:42:25.917 --> 00:42:28.442
of shit.

703
00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:32.918
Left shoulder.

704
00:42:35.493 --> 00:42:36.892
Right shoulder.

705
00:42:39.998 --> 00:42:41.260
Lock and load.

706
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:47.436
Order.

707
00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:52.072
This is my rifle.

708
00:42:52.243 --> 00:42:55.007
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

709
00:42:56.281 --> 00:42:59.580
My rifle is my best
friend. It is my life.

710
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:02.242
Get back in your bunks.

711
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.581
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

712
00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:07.254
What in the name
of Jesus H. Christ

713
00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:09.614
are you animals doing in my head?

714
00:43:09.794 --> 00:43:13.127
Why is Private Pyle out of
his bunk after lights out?

715
00:43:13.298 --> 00:43:16.131
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

716
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:19.657
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

717
00:43:19.838 --> 00:43:21.279
Sir, it is the private's duty to

718
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.035
inform the senior
drill instructor...

719
00:43:23.208 --> 00:43:25.777
that Private Pyle
has a full magazine

720
00:43:25.778 --> 00:43:27.941
and has locked and loaded, sir.

721
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.251
Now you listen to
me, Private Pyle...

722
00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:42.188
and you listen good.

723
00:43:42.627 --> 00:43:44.891
I want that weapon...

724
00:43:45.063 --> 00:43:47.691
and I want it now.

725
00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:52.465
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

726
00:43:52.637 --> 00:43:55.470
and step back away from it.

727
00:44:02.914 --> 00:44:06.406
What is your major
malfunction, numb-nuts?

728
00:44:06.584 --> 00:44:08.895
Didn't Mummy and Daddy
show you enough

729
00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:10.850
attention when you were a child?

730
00:44:36.414 --> 00:44:38.473
Easy, Leonard.

731
00:44:41.953 --> 00:44:44.012
Go easy, man.

732
00:45:09.714 --> 00:45:10.942

00:46:57.355 --> 00:47:00.279
Okay. Ten dollar each.

Yeah.

772
00:48:21.873 --> 00:48:24.467
You know what really pisses
me off about these people?

773
00:48:24.642 --> 00:48:25.973
What?

774
00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:28.179
We're supposed to be
helping them, and they

775
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.999
shit all over us every
chance they get.

776
00:48:30.181 --> 00:48:32.137
I just can't feature that.

777
00:48:32.317 --> 00:48:35.775
Don't take it too hard,
Rafterman. It's just business.

778
00:48:37.588 --> 00:48:40.944
I hate Da Nang, Joker. I
wanna go out into the field.

779
00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:43.081
I've been in country
almost three months...

780
00:48:43.261 --> 00:48:46.025
and all I do is take handshake
shots at award ceremonies.

781
00:48:46.197 --> 00:48:49.223
You'd get wasted your first day in
the field and it'd be my fault.

782
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.698
A high school girl
could do my job.

783
00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:53.666
I wanna get out into the shit.

784
00:48:53.838 --> 00:48:56.432
I wanna get some trigger time.

785
00:48:57.342 --> 00:48:59.065
If you get killed,
your mum will find

786
00:48:59.066 --> 00:49:00.834
me after I rotate
back to the world...

787
00:49:01.012 --> 00:49:02.775
and she'll beat the
shit out of me.

788
00:49:02.947 --> 00:49:05.438
That's a negative, Rafterman.

789
00:49:08.186 --> 00:49:10.086
Okay, guys. Let's
keep it short and

790
00:49:10.087 --> 00:49:12.145
sweet today. Anybody
got anything new?

791
00:49:14.492 --> 00:49:16.300
There's a rumour going
around that the

792
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:18.155
Tet ceasefire is going
to be cancelled.

793
00:49:18.596 --> 00:49:20.086
Rear-echelon paranoia.

794
00:49:20.431 --> 00:49:22.471
A bro in intelligence
says Charlie might

795
00:49:22.472 --> 00:49:24.561
try to pull off something
big during Tet.

796
00:49:24.736 --> 00:49:27.227
They say the same
thing every year.

797
00:49:27.372 --> 00:49:29.169
There's a lot of
talk about it, sir.

798
00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.137
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

799
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:33.391
The Tet holiday is like
the Fourth of July,

800
00:49:33.392 --> 00:49:35.473
Christmas and New Year
all rolled into one.

801
00:49:35.646 --> 00:49:39.002
Every zipperhead in Nam, North and
South, will be banging gongs...

802
00:49:39.183 --> 00:49:42.038
barking at the moon and
visiting his dead relatives.

803
00:49:42.453 --> 00:49:45.809
Right. Ann-Margret and entourage
are due here next week.

804
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.532
I want someone on the airfield and

805
00:49:47.533 --> 00:49:49.255
stick with her for
a couple of days.

806
00:49:49.427 --> 00:49:51.918
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

807
00:49:52.063 --> 00:49:53.758
And get some good low-angle stuff.

808
00:49:53.931 --> 00:49:55.787
Don't make it too obvious, but I

809
00:49:55.788 --> 00:49:57.992
wanna see fur and
early-morning dew.

810
00:49:58.169 --> 00:50:00.433
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

811
00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:02.337
Marine engineers
lend a helping hand

812
00:50:02.338 --> 00:50:04.302

village recently..."

813
00:50:04.475 --> 00:50:07.774
Chilli, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

814
00:50:07.945 --> 00:50:11.039
if they come to us to be
evacuated, they are refugees.

815
00:50:11.215 --> 00:50:12.978
I'll make a note of it, sir.

816
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:16.176
"NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

817
00:50:16.354 --> 00:50:18.368
A young North Vietnamese
Army regular,

818
00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:20.381
who realised his side
could not win...

819
00:50:20.558 --> 00:50:23.356
deserted from his unit after
reading Open Arms pamphlets."

820
00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:26.622
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

821
00:50:26.798 --> 00:50:30.529
Is there an irregular? How about
North Vietnamese Army soldier?

822
00:50:30.701 --> 00:50:31.759
I'll fix it up, sir.

823
00:50:32.203 --> 00:50:34.228
Lawrence Welk Show is
out on TV in two weeks.

824
00:50:34.405 --> 00:50:35.565
Dave, do 100 words on it.

825
00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.634
AFTV will give you
some background stuff.

826
00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:38.665
Sir.

827
00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:40.206
"Not while we're eating.

828
00:50:40.378 --> 00:50:42.903
NVA learnt Marines on a
search-and-destroy mission...

829
00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.412
don't like to be interrupted

830
00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:49.474
Search-and-destroy. We have a
new directive from MAF on this.

831
00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:52.111
In future, in place of
search-and-destroy,

832
00:50:52.112 --> 00:50:54.248
substitute the phrase
sweep-and-clear.

833
00:50:54.425 --> 00:50:57.724
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

834
00:50:58.563 --> 00:51:00.827
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

835
00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:02.957
Sir?

836
00:51:03.134 --> 00:51:05.142
The kill, Joker. The
kill. I mean, all that

837
00:51:05.143 --> 00:51:07.059
fire, the grunts must
have hit something.

838
00:51:07.238 --> 00:51:08.500
Didn't see them.

839
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.930
Joker, I've told you, we run
two basic stories here.

840
00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:14.910
Grunts who give half
their pay to buy

841
00:51:14.911 --> 00:51:16.568
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

842
00:51:16.747 --> 00:51:19.011
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

843
00:51:19.183 --> 00:51:22.778
And combat action that results
in a kill. Winning the war.

844
00:51:22.954 --> 00:51:26.651
Now, you must have seen
blood trails. Drag marks?

845
00:51:26.824 --> 00:51:28.485
It was raining, sir.

846
00:51:28.993 --> 00:51:31.826
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

847
00:51:31.996 --> 00:51:35.090
Now rewrite it and give it a
happy ending. Say, one killed.

848
00:51:35.266 --> 00:51:37.632
Make it a sapper or
an officer. Which?

849
00:51:38.135 --> 00:51:39.466
Whichever you say.

850
00:51:39.637 --> 00:51:42.128
Grunts like reading
about dead officers.

851
00:51:42.273 --> 00:51:45.504
Okay, an officer. How
about a general?

852
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:47.274
Joker...

853
00:51:47.445 --> 00:51:50.835
maybe you'd like our guys to
read the paper and feel bad.

854
00:51:51.015 --> 00:51:52.671
I mean, in case you
didn't know it,

855
00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:54.143
this is not a very popular war.

856
00:51:54.318 --> 00:51:56.445
Now, it is our job to
report the news...

857
00:51:56.621 --> 00:51:59.681
that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

858
00:52:00.458 --> 00:52:04.053
Sir, maybe you should go
out on some ops yourself.

859
00:52:04.228 --> 00:52:07.959
I'm sure you could find a lot
more blood trails and drag marks.

860
00:52:08.566 --> 00:52:10.557
Joker, I've had my
ass in the grass.

861
00:52:10.735 --> 00:52:12.691
Can't say I liked it much.

862
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:15.862
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

863
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.066
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

864
00:52:19.243 --> 00:52:21.438

874
00:52:56.147 --> 00:52:59.241
I ain't heard a shot
fired in anger in weeks.

875
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.416
Joker's so tough...

876
00:53:01.652 --> 00:53:05.042
he'd eat the boogers out
of a dead man's nose...

877
00:53:05.222 --> 00:53:07.110
then ask for seconds.

878
00:53:07.625 --> 00:53:09.684
Listen up, pilgrim.

879
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.354
A day without blood is like
a day without sunshine.

880
00:53:14.832 --> 00:53:16.129
Shit.

881
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.191
Joker thinks the bad bush is
between an old mama-san's legs.

882
00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:22.293
He's never been in the shit.

883
00:53:22.473 --> 00:53:25.203
It's hard to talk about it,
man. It's like on Hastings.

884
00:53:25.376 --> 00:53:27.901
You weren't on Operation
Hastings, Payback.

885
00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:30.741
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...

886
00:53:30.915 --> 00:53:33.770
you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

887
00:53:33.951 --> 00:53:35.350
I was there, man.

888
00:53:35.519 --> 00:53:37.248
I was in the shit with the grunts.

889
00:53:37.421 --> 00:53:41.209
Don't listen to any of
Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

890
00:53:41.392 --> 00:53:44.782
Sometimes he thinks
he's John Wayne.

891
00:53:45.496 --> 00:53:46.986
You listen to Joker, new guy.

892
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:48.758
He knows ti ti.

893
00:53:48.933 --> 00:53:50.457
Very little.

894
00:53:50.635 --> 00:53:53.433
You know he's never been in the
shit. He ain't got the stare.

895
00:53:53.604 --> 00:53:57.131
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

896
00:53:57.308 --> 00:54:00.300
A Marine gets it after he's
been in the shit for too long.

897
00:54:00.478 --> 00:54:02.002
It's like...

898
00:54:02.413 --> 00:54:04.301
It's like you're
really seeing beyond.

899
00:54:05.049 --> 00:54:06.277
I got it.

900
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:08.281
All field Marines got it.

901
00:54:08.452 --> 00:54:09.942
And you'll have it too.

902
00:54:10.121 --> 00:54:11.418
I will?

903
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:13.147
Hey, Payback...

904
00:54:13.324 --> 00:54:16.418
how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

905
00:54:17.028 --> 00:54:19.917
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

906
00:54:24.935 --> 00:54:27.028
- Incoming.
- Oh, shit.

907
00:54:28.706 --> 00:54:30.594
Them are outgoing.

908
00:54:32.543 --> 00:54:34.773
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

909
00:54:34.945 --> 00:54:36.572
Now, what did I just say?

910
00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:17.916
Hey, I hope they're
just fucking with us.

911
00:55:18.089 --> 00:55:21.354
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

912
00:56:14.278 --> 00:56:16.166
Cease fire.

913
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.378
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

914
00:56:26.023 --> 00:56:28.014
Cease fire.

915
00:56:39.003 --> 00:56:40.994
The enemy...

916
00:56:41.172 --> 00:56:43.663
has very deceitfully...

917
00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:46.696
taken advantage of
the Tet ceasefire...

918
00:56:46.877 --> 00:56:50.210
to launch an offensive
all over the country.

919
00:56:50.548 --> 00:56:54.211
So far, we've had it
pretty easy here.

920
00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:56.580
But we seem to be the exception.

921
00:56:57.321 --> 00:56:59.699
Charlie has hit every
major military

922
00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.076
target in Vietnam
and hit them hard.

923
00:57:02.259 --> 00:57:05.189
In Saigon the United
States Embassy

924
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:08.118
has been overrun
by suicide squads.

925
00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:10.221
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

926
00:57:10.401 --> 00:57:13.928
Khe Sanh is standing
by to be overrun.

927
00:57:15.206 --> 00:57:17.766
We also have reports that
a division of NVA...

928
00:57:17.942 --> 00:57:22.868
has occupied all of the city of
Hue south of the Perfume River.

929
00:57:23.047 --> 00:57:26.107
In strategic terms, Charlie's
cut the country in half...

930
00:57:26.283 --> 00:57:29.047
the civilian press are about
to wet their pants...

931
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.820
and we've heard even
Cronkite's going

932
00:57:31.821 --> 00:57:34.146
to say the war is now unwinnable.

933
00:57:34.758 --> 00:57:36.487
In other words...

934
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.141
it's a huge shit
sandwich and we're

935
00:57:39.142 --> 00:57:41.484
all going to have to take a bite.

936
00:57:44.368 --> 00:57:46.131
Sir.

937
00:57:46.437 --> 00:57:49.292
Does this mean that
Ann-Margret's not coming?

938
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:58.468
Joker, I want you to get
straight up to Phu Bai.

939
00:57:58.949 --> 00:58:02.146
Captain January will
need all his people.

940
00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:04.583
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...

941
00:58:04.755 --> 00:58:07.747
you will take off
that damn button.

942
00:58:07.925 --> 00:58:11.349
How's it going to look if you get
killed wearing a peace symbol?

943
00:58:11.528 --> 00:58:13.018
Sir.

944
00:58:13.163 --> 00:58:15.358
Permission to go with Joker?

945
00:58:16.066 --> 00:58:18.022
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

946
00:58:18.202 --> 00:58:21.126
Sir, permission not to
take Rafterman with me?

947
00:58:21.305 --> 00:58:23.398
You still here?

948
00:58:23.574 --> 00:58:27.203
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

949
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:29.710
You're responsible for him.

950
00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:07.176
Get some.

951
00:59:08.018 --> 00:59:09.747
Get some.

952
00:59:12.356 --> 00:59:15.245
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

953
00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.991
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

954
00:59:24.034 --> 00:59:25.626
Get some.

955
00:59:33.143 --> 00:59:35.304
Get some, baby.

956
00:59:35.646 --> 00:59:38.035
Get some. Get some. Get some.

957
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:41.677
Get some. Get some, come
on. Get it, come on.

958
00:59:41.852 --> 00:59:44.343
Get some. Get some.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

959
00:59:44.521 --> 00:59:46.716
I've got you, mother.

960
00:59:51.562 --> 00:59:54.690
Anyone who runs is a VC.

961
00:59:55.265 --> 00:59:57.790
Anyone who stands still...

962
00:59:57.968 --> 01:00:00.892
is a well-disciplined VC.

963
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.469
You guys ought to do a
story about me sometime.

964
01:00:07.644 --> 01:00:10.704
Why should we do a
story about you?

965
01:00:11.081 --> 01:00:13.174
Because I'm so fucking good.

966
01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:15.477
That ain't no shit neither.

967
01:00:15.652 --> 01:00:20.112
I've done got me 157
dead gooks killed.

968
01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.054
And 50 water buffaloes too.

969
01:00:23.227 --> 01:00:26.025
Them are all certified.

970
01:00:26.196 --> 01:00:29.051
Any women or children?

971
01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:31.193
Sometimes.

972
01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:36.033
How can you shoot
women and children?

973
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.937
Easy.

974
01:00:38.108 --> 01:00:40.497
You just don't lead them so much.

975
01:00:42.046 --> 01:00:44.002
Ain't war hell?

976
01:01:20.584 --> 01:01:22.711
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

977
01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:24.376
Down the road. Two-Five.

978
01:01:24.555 --> 01:01:27.319
Two-Five. Outstanding.
Thanks, Top.

979
01:01:52.082 --> 01:01:53.709
Excuse me.

980
01:01:53.884 --> 01:01:55.249
Sir.

981
01:01:55.419 --> 01:01:58.513
We're looking for 1st
Platoon, Hotel Two-Five.

982
01:01:58.689 --> 01:02:00.122
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

983
01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:01.689
You people one-one?

984
01:02:01.859 --> 01:02:04.157
No, sir. We're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

985
01:02:04.328 --> 01:02:06.159
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.

986
01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.355
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

987
01:02:08.532 --> 01:02:11.330
Cowboy's just down the
road in the platoon area.

988
01:02:11.502 --> 01:02:15.165
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

989
01:02:15.339 --> 01:02:18.570
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

990
01:02:18.742 --> 01:02:20.972
My people call me Mr Touchdown.

991
01:02:21.145 --> 01:02:22.635
I played ball for Notre Dame.

992
01:02:22.813 --> 01:02:24.110
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

993
01:02:24.281 --> 01:02:26.977
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

994
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:28.743
Never happen, sir.

995
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:31.174
Well, if you people
came looking for

996
01:02:31.175 --> 01:02:33.185
a story, this is your lucky day.

997
01:02:33.357 --> 01:02:36.520
We got Condition Red and we're
definitely expecting rain.

998
01:02:36.693 --> 01:02:39.457
Outstanding, sir. We
taking care of business?

999
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.120
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

1000
01:02:41.298 --> 01:02:43.823
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

1001
01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:46.196
street by street and
house by house.

1002
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:48.361
Charles definitely got
his shit together...

1003
01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:50.803
but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

1004
01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:53.151
We heard some scuttlebutt,
sir, about the

1005
01:02:53.152 --> 01:02:55.172
NVA executing a lot
of gook civilians.

1006
01:02:55.345 --> 01:02:56.778
That's affirmative.

1007
01:02:56.947 --> 01:03:00.576
I saw some bodies about a half a
klick this side of Phu Cam Canal.

1008
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.912
Will you show me where, sir?

1009
01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:06.847
Here's the canal.

1010
01:03:29.846 --> 01:03:33.009
The dead have been
covered with lime.

1011
01:03:34.218 --> 01:03:37.073
The dead know only one thing:

1012
01:03:37.754 --> 01:03:40.279
It is better to be alive.

1013
01:03:46.597 --> 01:03:48.189
Excuse me?

1014
01:03:48.365 --> 01:03:50.629
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

1015
01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:54.362
I make it 20. Is that the
official body count, sir?

1016
01:03:54.538 --> 01:03:55.971
What outfit are you men with?

1017
01:03:56.139 --> 01:03:58.266
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

1018
01:03:58.542 --> 01:04:00.066
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...

1019
01:04:00.244 --> 01:04:02.542
and this photographer
is Rafterman.

1020
01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:05.307
I'm Lieutenant Cleves and I'm
from Hartford, Connecticut.

1021
01:04:05.482 --> 01:04:08.406
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

1022
01:04:08.585 --> 01:04:10.678
Do you know how it happened, sir?

1023
01:04:11.054 --> 01:04:14.820
Well, it seems the NVA came
in with a list of gook names.

1024
01:04:14.992 --> 01:04:19.554
Government officials, policemen,
ARVIN officers, school teachers.

1025
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.721
They went around to their
houses real polite...

1026
01:04:21.898 --> 01:04:25.231
and asked them to report the next
day for political re-education.

1027
01:04:25.736 --> 01:04:28.000
Everybody who turned up got shot.

1028
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.798
Some they buried alive.

1029
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.337
Ready.

1030
01:04:32.943 --> 01:04:34.376
Colonel.

1031
01:04:35.912 --> 01:04:38.608
Marine, what is that button
on your body armour?

1032
01:04:38.782 --> 01:04:40.044
A peace symbol, sir.

1033
01:04:40.217 --> 01:04:42.811
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

1034
01:04:43.253 --> 01:04:45.118
What is that written
on your helmet?

1035
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:46.779
Born to kill, sir.

1036
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:49.948
You write born to kill on your
helmet and wear a peace button.

1037
01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:52.459
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

1038
01:04:52.629 --> 01:04:55.189
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

1039
01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.730
I don't know, sir.

1040
01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.390
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

1041
01:04:58.535 --> 01:04:59.986
Get your head and your ass wired

1042
01:04:59.987 --> 01:05:01.800
together or I will
take a shit on you.

1043
01:05:01.972 --> 01:05:03.701
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...

1044
01:05:03.874 --> 01:05:06.240
or you'll be standing

1045
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:09.368
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

1046
01:05:09.445 --> 01:05:10.445
The what?

1047
01:05:10.446 --> 01:05:13.141
The duality of man. The
Jungian thing, sir.

1048
01:05:14.351 --> 01:05:16.581
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

1049
01:05:16.753 --> 01:05:18.380
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

1050
01:05:18.555 --> 01:05:20.147
How about getting
with the program.

1051
01:05:20.324 --> 01:05:22.747
Jump on the team and come
on in for the big win.

Yes, sir.

1053
01:05:24.127 --> 01:05:26.436
All I've asked of my
Marines is for them to

1054
01:05:26.437 --> 01:05:28.587

would God's word.

the Vietnamese...

1056

is an American trying to get out.

1211
01:20:00.681 --> 01:20:04.208
so we have to assault with
tanks, we roll in the streets.

1212
01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:06.774
So they send us in
first to squat...

1213
01:20:06.954 --> 01:20:10.685
make sure that there
are no little...

1214
01:20:11.826 --> 01:20:15.057
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40
rockets to blow the tanks away.

1215
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:17.720
So we clear it out and
we roll the tanks in...

1216
01:20:17.898 --> 01:20:20.230
and basically blow
the place to hell.

1217
01:20:20.835 --> 01:20:24.430
When we're in Hue, when
we're in Hue City...

1218
01:20:24.605 --> 01:20:26.561
it's like a war, you know...

1219
01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:28.629
like what... What...

1220
01:20:28.809 --> 01:20:31.801
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was...

1221
01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:34.470
You know, was supposed to be.

1222
01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:37.845
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1223
01:20:38.452 --> 01:20:41.580
I don't think there's any question
about it. I mean, we're the best.

1224
01:20:41.756 --> 01:20:43.883
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav...

1225
01:20:44.058 --> 01:20:46.185
When the shit hits the
fan, who do they call?

1226
01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.693
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1227
01:20:49.864 --> 01:20:52.856
Do I think America
belongs in Vietnam?

1228
01:20:53.534 --> 01:20:57.459
I don't know. I belong in
Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1229
01:20:57.638 --> 01:20:59.868
Can I quote LBJ?

1230
01:21:01.409 --> 01:21:04.901
"I will not send American boys...

1231
01:21:05.079 --> 01:21:07.343
8 or 10,000 miles
around the world...

1232
01:21:07.515 --> 01:21:11.713
to do a job that Asian boys ought
to be doing for themselves."

1233
01:21:13.621 --> 01:21:17.944
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1234
01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:21.891
you know, I mean, like
they... It's sort of like...

1235
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:25.820
they took away our freedom and
gave it to the gookers, you know.

1236
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.558
But they don't want it.

1237
01:21:27.735 --> 01:21:30.158
They'd rather be alive than
free, I guess, you know.

1238
01:21:30.337 --> 01:21:32.328
Poor, dumb bastards.

1239
01:21:33.207 --> 01:21:37.940
Well, the ones I'm fighting at are
some pretty... Pretty bad boys.

1240
01:21:38.112 --> 01:21:39.875
I'm not real...

1241
01:21:41.048 --> 01:21:43.881
I'm not real keen on
some of these fellas...

1242
01:21:44.051 --> 01:21:47.475
that are supposedly on our side.

1243
01:21:47.655 --> 01:21:50.488
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1244
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.584
Yeah.

1245
01:21:54.161 --> 01:21:56.356
I mean, we're getting
killed for these people...

1246
01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:58.691
and they don't even appreciate it.

1247
01:21:59.366 --> 01:22:01.288
They think it's a big joke.

1248
01:22:01.936 --> 01:22:03.927
Well, if you ask me...

1249
01:22:04.405 --> 01:22:06.430
we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1250
01:22:06.907 --> 01:22:08.647
Well, it depends on
the situation. I

1251
01:22:08.648 --> 01:22:10.434
mean, I'm here to
take combat photos.

1252
01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:14.172
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1253
01:22:15.182 --> 01:22:17.946
What do I think about America's
involvement in the war?

1254
01:22:18.119 --> 01:22:19.882
Well, I think we should win.

1255
01:22:20.521 --> 01:22:22.512
I hate Vietnam.

1256
01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:24.715
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1257
01:22:24.892 --> 01:22:27.019
They don't have one
horse in Vietnam.

1258
01:22:27.194 --> 01:22:29.788
There's something basically
wrong with that.

1259
01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:33.154
Well, if they'd send
us more guys, maybe...

1260
01:22:33.334 --> 01:22:37.361
and bomb the hell out of the
North, they might give up.

1261
01:22:38.139 --> 01:22:43.668
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of South-east Asia.

1262
01:22:44.278 --> 01:22:46.824
I wanted to meet interesting
and stimulating

1263
01:22:46.825 --> 01:22:48.635
people of an ancient culture...

1264
01:22:48.816 --> 01:22:50.113
and kill them.

1265
01:22:50.551 --> 01:22:55.375
I wanted to be the first kid on
my block to get a confirmed kill.

1266
01:23:14.074 --> 01:23:16.235
Ten-hut.

1267
01:23:18.045 --> 01:23:19.569
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

1268
01:23:19.747 --> 01:23:22.636
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

1269
01:23:22.817 --> 01:23:24.910
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1270
01:23:25.286 --> 01:23:26.583
My, my, my.

1271
01:23:27.154 --> 01:23:30.453
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?

1272
01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:34.458
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1273
01:23:34.628 --> 01:23:37.017
I'm so horny, I can't
even get a piece of hand.

1274
01:23:37.198 --> 01:23:38.210
Me want sucky.

1275
01:23:38.211 --> 01:23:40.395
Sucky, fucky, smoke
cigarette in her pussy.

1276
01:23:40.568 --> 01:23:43.128
She give you everything
you want, long time.

1277
01:23:43.337 --> 01:23:47.262
Everything you want. Hey,
how much there, chief?

1278
01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:49.705
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

1279
01:23:52.046 --> 01:23:54.708
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1280
01:23:54.882 --> 01:23:56.144
Five dollar each.

1281
01:23:56.317 --> 01:23:58.114
Come on, she love you good.

1282
01:23:58.285 --> 01:23:59.809
Boom-boom long time.

1283
01:23:59.987 --> 01:24:01.682
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.

1284
01:24:01.856 --> 01:24:03.346
No. Ten dollars.

1285
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.685
Be glad to trade you
some ARVIN rifles.

1286
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:08.693
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1287
01:24:09.597 --> 01:24:11.360
Okay, $5. You give me.

1288
01:24:11.532 --> 01:24:13.864
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

1289
01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:16.500
Let's get mounted.

1290
01:24:21.909 --> 01:24:23.467
Something wrong there, chief?

1291
01:24:23.644 --> 01:24:25.600
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1292
01:24:25.779 --> 01:24:27.337
What the motherfuck?

1293
01:24:27.514 --> 01:24:30.039
She says soul brother too
beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1294
01:24:30.217 --> 01:24:31.548
What is this, man?

1295
01:24:31.719 --> 01:24:34.217
I think what he's
trying to tell you

1296
01:24:34.218 --> 01:24:36.782
is you black boys
pack too much meat.

1297
01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:40.487
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1298
01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:42.322
Oh, shit.

1299
01:24:42.496 --> 01:24:44.242
This baby-san looks like she could

1300
01:24:44.243 --> 01:24:46.193
suck the chrome off
a trailer hitch.

1301
01:24:46.367 --> 01:24:49.427
She say too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1302
01:24:49.603 --> 01:24:51.525
Excuse me, madam.

1303
01:24:52.239 --> 01:24:54.230
What we have here,
little yellow sister...

1304
01:24:54.408 --> 01:24:58.833
is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1305
01:24:59.046 --> 01:25:01.606
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1306
01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.572
Okay, okay.

1307
01:25:05.286 --> 01:25:07.242
Okay, okay.

1308
01:25:08.589 --> 01:25:10.853
All right. Yeah.
This is my boogie.

1309
01:25:11.025 --> 01:25:13.220
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

1310
01:25:13.394 --> 01:25:16.784
Back off, white bread. Don't get
between a dog and his meat.

1311
01:25:16.964 --> 01:25:20.263
All fucking niggers
must fucking hang.

1312
01:25:20.434 --> 01:25:23.562
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a...

1313
01:25:23.737 --> 01:25:27.867
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1314
01:25:28.042 --> 01:25:30.340
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.

1315
01:26:03.544 --> 01:26:05.842
Intelligence passed
the word down...

1316
01:26:06.013 --> 01:26:09.574
that during the night the NVA
had pulled out of our area...

1317
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:12.708
to positions across
the Perfume River.

1318
01:26:12.886 --> 01:26:17.277
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1319
01:26:48.756 --> 01:26:51.520
Face outboard and
take cover. Do it.

1320
01:27:05.005 --> 01:27:06.529
Shit.

1321
01:27:15.115 --> 01:27:17.003
He ain't going to make it.

1322
01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.547
Shit.

1323
01:27:28.062 --> 01:27:31.327
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1324
01:27:32.766 --> 01:27:36.258
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1325
01:27:37.137 --> 01:27:38.627
Hotel One. Over.

1326
01:27:38.806 --> 01:27:40.831
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1327
01:27:41.008 --> 01:27:44.341
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1328
01:27:45.546 --> 01:27:47.241
Wait, One.

1329
01:27:48.415 --> 01:27:52.875
Okay. You're senior NCO,
Cowboy. You're in charge.

1330
01:27:53.187 --> 01:27:54.779
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.

1331
01:27:54.955 --> 01:27:56.679
And call in at the
next checkpoint.

1332
01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.753
Shit.

1333
01:27:57.754 --> 01:28:00.154
Roger. Out.

1334
01:28:06.567 --> 01:28:08.432
I'm squad leader.

1335
01:28:11.438 --> 01:28:13.827
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1336
01:28:14.942 --> 01:28:16.500
All right.

1337
01:28:17.311 --> 01:28:18.869
He's dead.

1338
01:28:59.987 --> 01:29:01.511
Cowboy.

1339
01:29:08.328 --> 01:29:09.590
What's up?

1340
01:29:09.863 --> 01:29:13.094
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1341
01:29:13.267 --> 01:29:15.656
Here, see what you think.

1342
01:29:17.771 --> 01:29:20.797
I think we're here...

1343
01:29:21.341 --> 01:29:24.265
and we should be here.

1344
01:29:25.879 --> 01:29:28.006
- We're here?
- Yeah.

1345
01:29:28.182 --> 01:29:31.447
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1346
01:29:37.591 --> 01:29:39.320
Fuck.

1347
01:29:44.665 --> 01:29:46.292
What do you think?

1348
01:29:47.935 --> 01:29:50.699
Well, I think we should
change direction.

1349
01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:06.209
Okay.

1350
01:30:06.853 --> 01:30:08.878
We'll change direction.

1351
01:30:19.533 --> 01:30:21.091
What's up?

1352
01:30:21.268 --> 01:30:23.190
Changing direction.

1353
01:30:23.904 --> 01:30:25.132
What are we, lost?

1354
01:30:25.305 --> 01:30:28.399
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1355
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:30.836
Okay, listen up.

1356
01:30:31.011 --> 01:30:33.104
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1357
01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.111
Okay, we're changing direction.

1358
01:30:35.282 --> 01:30:37.011
We're heading over that way.

1359
01:30:37.184 --> 01:30:40.381
Eightball's going to go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1360
01:30:40.887 --> 01:30:43.276
- Got it?
- Got it.

1361
01:30:43.991 --> 01:30:46.983
Eightball, let's dance.

1362
01:30:47.561 --> 01:30:49.859
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1363
01:31:50.957 --> 01:31:52.481
Fuck.

1364
01:32:08.208 --> 01:32:09.607
Cease fire.

1365
01:32:09.776 --> 01:32:11.664
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1366
01:32:11.845 --> 01:32:14.370
Cool it, goddamn it.
Cool it. Cease fire.

1367
01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:16.072
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

1368
01:32:16.249 --> 01:32:17.477
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

1369
01:32:17.651 --> 01:32:21.178
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a
sniper? Did anybody see anything?

1370
01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:23.016
Anybody see a sniper?

1371
01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:24.680
- Nothing.
- Negative.

1372
01:32:24.858 --> 01:32:28.749
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1373
01:32:29.696 --> 01:32:30.856
Eightball.

1374
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:33.625
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1375
01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.495
Animal, cease fire.

1376
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:37.796
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1377
01:32:37.971 --> 01:32:39.461
This is Cowboy. Over.

1378
01:32:39.606 --> 01:32:43.064
This is Murphy. What is your
present position? Over.

1379
01:32:43.243 --> 01:32:45.541
Murph, we're receiving
enemy sniper fire.

1380
01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:46.974
Eightball is down.

1381
01:32:47.147 --> 01:32:50.036
Our position is about half a
klick north of Checkpoint Four.

1382
01:32:50.217 --> 01:32:52.091
Believe possible
strong enemy forces

1383
01:32:52.092 --> 01:32:53.914
occupying buildings
in front of us.

1384
01:32:54.087 --> 01:32:57.579
Request immediate
tank support. Over.

1385
01:32:58.091 --> 01:32:59.490
Roger. Understand.

1386
01:32:59.659 --> 01:33:02.150
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1387
01:33:02.329 --> 01:33:04.695
Roger. Over and out.

1388
01:33:04.865 --> 01:33:07.163
- Stay close.
- Got it.

1389
01:33:07.801 --> 01:33:11.828
Okay, listen up. I think we're
being set up for an ambush.

1390
01:33:12.005 --> 01:33:13.637
I think there may be strong enemy

1391
01:33:13.638 --> 01:33:15.566
forces in those
buildings over there.

1392
01:33:15.742 --> 01:33:17.607
I've requested tank support.

1393
01:33:17.778 --> 01:33:21.043
We're going to sit tight till it
comes, but keep your eyes open.

1394
01:33:21.214 --> 01:33:25.241
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1395
01:33:26.286 --> 01:33:29.016
Goddamn it. Halt. Cease
your fire, Mother.

1396
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:31.077
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

1397
01:33:31.258 --> 01:33:33.021
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

1398
01:33:33.193 --> 01:33:35.957
We're not leaving him, we'll get
him when the tank comes up.

1399
01:33:36.129 --> 01:33:38.791
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1400
01:33:38.965 --> 01:33:40.990
I seen this before.

1401
01:33:41.168 --> 01:33:44.399
That sniper's just trying to
suck us in, one at a time.

1402
01:33:46.273 --> 01:33:49.436
Goddamn it. No.

1403
01:33:49.609 --> 01:33:51.525
Goddamn it, cease
fire. Cease fire.

1404
01:33:51.526 --> 01:33:52.533
Man, fuck this...

1405
01:33:52.712 --> 01:33:54.805
Fuck this shit. I'm going
in to bring him out.

1406
01:33:54.981 --> 01:33:57.652
No, you sit the fuck
down, goddamn it.

1407
01:33:57.653 --> 01:33:58.653
Cover me.

1408
01:34:14.468 --> 01:34:18.962
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1409
01:34:19.139 --> 01:34:21.403
Cease fire.

1410
01:34:32.786 --> 01:34:34.083
Hold your fire.

1411
01:34:34.254 --> 01:34:36.279
Hold your fire.

1412
01:34:36.456 --> 01:34:38.947
Cease fire, you can't
see the sniper.

1413
01:34:39.125 --> 01:34:43.482
Save the ammo. Nobody fire
till I tell you. Nobody.

1414
01:34:48.935 --> 01:34:50.732
Hold your fire.

1415
01:34:51.438 --> 01:34:53.929
What the fuck do
we do now, Cowboy?

1416
01:34:55.175 --> 01:34:57.166
Give me that fucking radio.

1417
01:35:01.381 --> 01:35:03.975
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1418
01:35:04.150 --> 01:35:05.640
This is Murphy. Over.

1419
01:35:05.785 --> 01:35:08.151
Murph, we're in some deep
shit. I got two men down.

1420
01:35:08.355 --> 01:35:11.244
What's the story on that
fucking tank? Over.

1421
01:35:12.325 --> 01:35:15.783
Sorry, Cowboy. No luck
so far with the tank.

1422
01:35:15.962 --> 01:35:18.226
Will advise. Over.

1423
01:35:19.232 --> 01:35:21.188
Roger. Out.

1424
01:35:21.601 --> 01:35:23.899
Numb-nut bastards.

1425
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:27.164
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1426
01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:30.100
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1427
01:35:30.277 --> 01:35:32.199
I think they're going
to hit us any minute.

1428
01:35:32.379 --> 01:35:34.574
When they do, we won't
have time to pull out.

1429
01:35:34.748 --> 01:35:37.706
We got to do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1430
01:35:37.884 --> 01:35:40.148
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

1431
01:35:40.554 --> 01:35:44.342
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1432
01:35:44.524 --> 01:35:45.786
Back off, Mother.

1433
01:35:45.959 --> 01:35:48.917
I'm calling the plays. I
say we're pulling out.

1434
01:35:49.095 --> 01:35:50.892
Well, what about Doc
Jay and Eightball?

1435
01:35:51.064 --> 01:35:53.030
I know it's a shitty
thing to do, but we

1436
01:35:53.031 --> 01:35:54.852
can't refuse to
accept the situation.

1437
01:35:55.035 --> 01:35:57.299
We're not leaving Doc Jay
and Eightball out there.

1438
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:59.301
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1439
01:35:59.472 --> 01:36:02.202
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1440
01:36:02.375 --> 01:36:04.866
We got to bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1441
01:36:05.011 --> 01:36:07.377
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1442
01:36:11.585 --> 01:36:15.715
Fuck you, Cowboy. Fuck
all you assholes.

1443
01:36:17.824 --> 01:36:20.850
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

1444
01:36:21.027 --> 01:36:23.723
You motherfucker.

1445
01:36:39.379 --> 01:36:42.109
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1446
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:45.872
Where's the sniper?

1447
01:36:48.855 --> 01:36:52.018
Doc, where's the sniper?

1448
01:37:00.734 --> 01:37:02.463
Shit.

1449
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:06.595
Shit. Fuck.

1450
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.512
Fuck.

1451
01:37:54.187 --> 01:37:56.314
Hey, Cowboy.

1452
01:37:56.656 --> 01:37:58.419
Yeah?

1453
01:37:59.292 --> 01:38:02.784
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1454
01:38:03.396 --> 01:38:06.888
There's only one
sniper, nothing else.

1455
01:38:07.267 --> 01:38:11.124
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1456
01:38:11.971 --> 01:38:13.461
Come on.

1457
01:38:16.076 --> 01:38:18.271
Son of a bitch.

1458
01:38:22.048 --> 01:38:24.608
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

1459
01:38:25.652 --> 01:38:27.860
No-Doze, Stutten,
Donlon, Rock, you

1460
01:38:27.861 --> 01:38:29.884
come with me, we'll take a look.

1461
01:38:30.323 --> 01:38:32.712
The rest of you all stay
put and cover our ass.

1462
01:38:32.892 --> 01:38:35.690
We may be coming
back in a big hurry.

1463
01:38:36.563 --> 01:38:38.895
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

1464
01:38:39.065 --> 01:38:40.896
Okay.

1465
01:38:41.067 --> 01:38:42.728
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1466
01:38:42.902 --> 01:38:43.926
Let's move out.

1467
01:38:44.304 --> 01:38:45.362
Let's do it.

1468
01:39:23.576 --> 01:39:24.907
Hey, Cowboy.

1469
01:39:25.078 --> 01:39:27.569
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1470
01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:50.029
Donlon, give me that radio.

1471
01:39:52.572 --> 01:39:54.301
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1472
01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:05.415
Cowboy.

1473
01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.207
Holy shit. That sniper's
got a clean shot.

1474
01:40:07.387 --> 01:40:09.275
Get him the fuck out of here.

1475
01:40:15.995 --> 01:40:18.691
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

1476
01:40:18.865 --> 01:40:20.992
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

1477
01:40:21.167 --> 01:40:22.759
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

1478
01:40:22.936 --> 01:40:24.233
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

1479
01:40:24.404 --> 01:40:26.269
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

1480
01:40:26.439 --> 01:40:29.272
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

1481
01:40:29.442 --> 01:40:31.392
You know I'm not
going to shit you,

1482
01:40:31.393 --> 01:40:33.071
man. You're my favourite turd.

1483
01:40:33.713 --> 01:40:34.907
Come on. Easy.

1484
01:40:35.315 --> 01:40:36.441
Here you go.

1485
01:40:38.151 --> 01:40:42.042
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

1486
01:40:45.892 --> 01:40:48.918
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1487
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:58.425
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

1488
01:41:54.494 --> 01:41:57.054
Let's go get some payback.

1489
01:42:02.969 --> 01:42:04.561
Okay.

1490
01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.439
Okay.

1491
01:42:19.886 --> 01:42:21.979
Watch that fucking hole.

1492
01:42:23.256 --> 01:42:24.484
Throw some smoke.

1493
01:42:41.007 --> 01:42:42.804
Okay, ready?

1494
01:43:23.816 --> 01:43:27.547
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1495
01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:35.287
Joker, in there. New guy.

1496
01:45:39.285 --> 01:45:42.209
We got the sniper.

1497
01:46:15.922 --> 01:46:17.446
Joker?

1498
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.480
Yo.

1499
01:46:19.825 --> 01:46:21.383
What's up?

1500
01:46:22.862 --> 01:46:25.023
We got the sniper.

1501
01:46:37.577 --> 01:46:39.533
I saved Joker's ass.

1502
01:46:39.712 --> 01:46:41.509
I got the sniper.

1503
01:46:41.681 --> 01:46:44.343
I fucking blew her away.

1504
01:46:45.184 --> 01:46:47.140
Am I bad?

1505
01:46:47.753 --> 01:46:51.746
Am I a life-taker?
Am I a heartbreaker?

1506
01:47:09.308 --> 01:47:11.469
What's she saying?

1507
01:47:15.114 --> 01:47:16.945
She's praying.

1508
01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:24.119
No more boom-boom
for this baby-san.

1509
01:47:27.026 --> 01:47:29.449
There's nothing we can do for her.

1510
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:33.123
She's dead meat.

1511
01:47:37.603 --> 01:47:39.036
Okay.

1512
01:47:40.339 --> 01:47:42.500
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1513
01:47:47.013 --> 01:47:48.878
What about her?

1514
01:47:52.652 --> 01:47:54.313
Fuck her.

1515
01:47:55.655 --> 01:47:57.350
Let her rot.

1516
01:48:13.673 --> 01:48:16.005
We can't just leave her here.

1517
01:48:19.211 --> 01:48:21.099
Hey, asshole.

1518
01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.810
Cowboy's wasted.

1519
01:48:24.283 --> 01:48:26.843
You're fresh out of friends.

1520
01:48:27.953 --> 01:48:29.784
I'm running this squad now...

1521
01:48:29.955 --> 01:48:34.221
and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1522
01:48:38.064 --> 01:48:41.124
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1523
01:48:42.968 --> 01:48:46.927
I'm just saying we can't
leave her like this.

1524
01:48:56.449 --> 01:48:59.407
Shoot me.

1525
01:49:01.354 --> 01:49:03.379
Shoot...

1526
01:49:03.889 --> 01:49:05.481
me.

1527
01:49:06.058 --> 01:49:08.151
Shoot...

1528
01:49:08.661 --> 01:49:10.253
me.

1529
01:49:10.730 --> 01:49:12.721
Shoot.

1530
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.095
Shoot.

1531
01:49:17.303 --> 01:49:20.602
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1532
01:49:22.475 --> 01:49:24.568
waste her.

1533
01:49:24.744 --> 01:49:26.371
Shoot...

1534
01:49:28.547 --> 01:49:29.980
me.

1535
01:49:34.086 --> 01:49:36.850
Shoot me.

1536
01:49:38.791 --> 01:49:40.019
Shoot...

1537
01:49:41.293 --> 01:49:43.022
me.

1538
01:49:43.396 --> 01:49:45.489
Shoot...

1539
01:49:46.198 --> 01:49:47.631
me.

1540
01:49:48.234 --> 01:49:50.429
Shoot.

1541
01:49:52.071 --> 01:49:54.096
Shoot.

1542
01:49:57.743 --> 01:49:59.267
Shoot.

1543
01:50:00.279 --> 01:50:01.871
Shoot.

1544
01:50:39.185 --> 01:50:41.016
Joker...

1545
01:50:41.187 --> 01:50:43.732
we're going to have
to put you up for

1546
01:50:43.733 --> 01:50:45.942
the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1547
01:50:49.728 --> 01:50:51.855
Hard-core, man.

1548
01:50:53.866 --> 01:50:56.391
Fucking hard-core.

1549
01:51:13.385 --> 01:51:18.448
We have nailed our names in the
pages of history enough for today.

1550
01:51:19.058 --> 01:51:23.722
We hump down to the Perfume
River to set in for the night.
