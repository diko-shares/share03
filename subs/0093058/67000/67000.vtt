00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,156
A CURTAIN RAISER

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,110
Based on <i>Un Incompris</i>
by Henry de Montherlant

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,151
Thirty minutes late!

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,557
In the 8 months I've known her,

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,479
she's been at least 45 minutes late
for every rendez-vous.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,794
It's diabolical.

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,791
How inelegant, how un-French,

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,230
to deplore a woman for her lateness!

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,113
What kind of woman arrives on time?

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,550
A sexless monster, fit for stoning,

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,717
like the hermaphrodites
of antiquity.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,159
Everyone's late in Paris.
No one complains.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,189
I do!

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,515
When someone's late,
your next appointment gets delayed!

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,878
And the next.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,831
One pest's tardiness
can botch a serious affair.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,553
Such pests are wise
to fear manic timekeeping!

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,229
They'd rather leave it to others.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,675
That's what sickens me.

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,469
Their lateness states
the world is divided between

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,511
those who care
and those who don't!

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,429
"Put yourself out for me, but
I won't put myself out for you."

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,952
If you were waiting
for the executioner,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,391
his tardiness would upset you more
than the prospect of dying!

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,592
I'd sooner be attacked
from the front, or even betrayed.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,955
Bad manners
are the cruellest insult.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,275
Personally, I'm too sure of myself
to crave respect,

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,794
especially from my lovers.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,957
The only attentions
I require of them

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,719
are indescribable,
even in this bachelor flat.

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,156
Thirty years ago
people talked of free love,

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,679
but all love is servitude.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,793
Not for me.

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,431
Pretentious little fool!

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,234
I pretend to be no one but myself.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,070
With such ideas, you'll have
to forego both love and friendship.

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,557
What power you give to others,
if their lateness enrages you so!

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,558
It's true.
In the end I prefer solitude.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,834
I've an idea.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,118
Abolish for all time

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,718
your watches and clocks.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,354
You won't know if people are late.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,073
Better still,
you'll be late yourself.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,873
You'll redress the balance
and fit in!

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,390
Sadly, punctuality
is a terrible disease.

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,951
I couldn't be imprecise if I tried.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,791
I can't help it.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,593
I could not merrily become a cad.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,108
- A cad for such a little thing?
- Yes, a cad!

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,391
It was different in the past.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,558
If an actor was late
for a performance,

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,593
it was customary for him
to apologise to the audience.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,596
On bended knee.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,471
Bended knee!

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,750
Did you teach Rosette that?

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,432
In 8 months,
she's been late 2,177 minutes.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,438
That's 36 hours.
36 wasted hours.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,793
Plus the first 20 minutes

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,308
of each meeting,
when I berated her!

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,557
Rosette has stolen
36 hours of my life.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
Hugo penned <i>Tristesse d'Olympio</i>
in 6 hours.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,393
In the time Rosette has cost me

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,476
I could have written 6 such poems!

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,033
Have you told her?

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,638
No. Last time I said,

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,356
"This has gone on for 8 months.
Next time you're late, it's over."

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,791
I made no bones about it.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,831
And what was her reply?

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,749
She laughed in my face.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,588
Of course. Endure it 8 months,
you'll endure it forever.

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,031
She won't laugh if she arrives
past 5.45. I'll stick to my guns.

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,958
It'll be like a Greek tragedy!

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,869
I'm impervious to your mockery.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,671
I know I'm right.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,758
To be right... in love!

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,755
Why can't one be right in love?

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,912
Must love always reduce

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,555
justice, wisdom and pride
to ridicule?

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,716
When love assumes
the face of justice,

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,558
wisdom and pride,
it cuts a bad figure.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,556
It dons a carnival mask.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,152
By arriving late,

83
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,590
Rosette occupies your thoughts
all the more.

84
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,438
So what, if I think only ill of her?

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,912
Sometimes I enjoy it
when a lover is late.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,553
While waiting,
I imagine he's lost interest.

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,469
And realise
how much he means to you?

88
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,274
No, how indifferent
I'd be to losing him.

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,596
But I love Rosette.

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,392
Therein lies my pain.

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,995
Tell me,

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,395
does she give reasons
for being late?

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,317
How does she explain it?

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,875
She has all the good reasons
those with bad ones have.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,675
And the endless details
provided by those who lie.

96
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,235
The time before last, supposedly,
as she left home,

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,989
heavy rain broke the glass roof
of the library.

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,828
She had to help her family
save books from the flood.

99
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,949
Do you believe the roof broke?
I find it odd.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,831
That's why I believe it.

101
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,199
Anyway, her last excuse

102
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,869
was that lateness
runs in her family.

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,879
The family is sacred,
my lips are sealed!

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,751
Only 5 minutes left.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,917
If she arrives in 6,
it's over forever.

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,188
O, Plutarchian hero!

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,357
Your noble debate
will elevate the human race!

108
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,230
Everything is suddenly transformed!

109
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,397
As by a scene change in the theatre!

110
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,639
She's here...

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,197
My world is restored to me.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,193
I'm here to read the gas meter.

113
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,196
- I don't have gas.
- I thought...

114
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,549
Damn!

115
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,239
He certainly looked
as if he thought so!

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,838
In 2 minutes

117
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,916
I'm getting dressed and we're going.

118
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,316
Or rather,
I'll ask you to wait for her.

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,114
If Rosette finds a locked door,
she might not understand.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,594
She may have forgotten
my ultimatum.

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,473
She has to learn her lesson.

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,953
Lesson?

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,275
You're taking yourself
too seriously.

124
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,031
I'll wait for Rosette and explain
your behaviour, but in my own way.

125
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,189
What date should I set
for your next rendez-vous?

126
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,351
There won't be one.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,670
- What's that?
- Water.

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,358
- Water?
- The toilet flushing.

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,913
- By itself?
- By itself.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,034
Rosette's bound to ring now.
I'll open the door a crack.

131
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,198
It's unbearable!
Complain to the owner.

132
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,596
I did! He says noise
adds gaiety to a flat.

133
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,275
I'm sorry to have to say this,
dear boy,

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,474
but all this is unwon'thy
of a great passion.

135
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,796
What are you enacting here?
A drama or a farce?

136
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,351
Nothing more than a curtain raiser.

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,715
But it's disconcerting.
The public likes a clear-cut genre.

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,991
No! It's the critics
who like clear-cut genres.

139
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,237
They say the author
hesitates between genres,

140
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,671
when in fact it's life
that hesitates between genres.

141
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,511
5.45. It's over.
I'm getting dressed.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,994
If she rings, you know what to do.

143
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,031
Is that your final word?

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,799
Do you still doubt it?

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,116
How childish!
A man at the mercy of his nerves.

146
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,720
Nerves? You understand nothing.

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,478
I'd just advise you

148
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,829
to maintain
some generosity of spirit!

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,992
One last time!

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,915
- It's you!
- Hello.

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,872
Where's Bruno?

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,230
I kept him company
while he waited for you.

153
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,872
But it's 5.50.

154
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,638
- He left 5 minutes ago.
- Left?

155
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,398
Didrt he warn you
if you were late again,

156
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,396
he'd be merciless?

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,317
I don't remember.

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,953
He may have said that.

159
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,429
You should've taken him
at his word.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,879
Don't you know Bruno?

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,879
He's a principled young man
from another era.

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,836
He went off, without waiting for me?
What a cad!

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,235
He did wait 45 minutes!

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,875
And lost patience in your company?
He was a cad to you too!

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,037
True, that hadrt occurred to me!

166
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,038
And to think we'll be apart
for 3 months!

167
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,910
My mother's changed her mind.

168
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,155
We're going on holiday tomorrow.

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,590
Bruno and I won't see each other
for a long time.

170
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,509
My dear girl,
you won't see our friend at all.

171
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,793
He's returning you to your mother.

172
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Your tardiness infuriates him.

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,637
And he did give you proper warning.

174
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,797
After all, he is a gentleman.

175
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,230
A gentleman?

176
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,271
You're both crazy!

177
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,231
I brought him some plums!

178
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,792
The plums made me late!

179
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,759
If he has a change of heart,

180
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,711
where can he reach you?

181
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,239
We leave in 2 days. We must pack.
Mother won't let me out.

182
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,236
She watches me like a hawk.

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,829
So I see. For here you are.

184
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,871
Your departure changes everything.
All is not lost.

185
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,872
Bruno, did you hear?

186
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,028
Rosette's leaving
in 2 days for 3 months.

187
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,553
Come out of there.

188
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,829
He's in there?

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,953
After 45 minutes of lofty verbiage
in the worst possible taste,

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,309
he went to dress.
Now he's coming out.

191
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,554
Come on, Bruno!

192
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,158
Come out of there.

193
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,156
He's not coming out.

194
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,996
The cad!

195
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,235
Did you hear?
Rosette called you a cad.

196
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,792
- What do you want?
- Your happiness!

197
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,796
I make a heroic sacrifice
and I'm a cad?

198
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,398
You're so misunderstood!

199
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,759
Let me go!

200
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,916
I'm coming out.

201
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm coming out of the bathroom,
but I remain inflexible.

202
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,873
I'm slipping away.

203
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,515
I know you won't back down
in front of me.

204
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,757
But when you two are alone
you'll sort things out.

205
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,752
Goodbye, Rosette.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,878
What's this scene about?

207
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,194
You've gone too far. It's over.

208
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,394
Just because I was late?

209
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,158
Because you're always late.

210
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,675
Verily, what love!

211
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,917
I love you to the extreme,
even at this moment.

212
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,749
But if love means being slighted
by the one you love,

213
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,519
it's not won'th much.

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,313
I've always heard the contrary.

215
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,310
That it's easy to bear small things
from the one you love.

216
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,388
I'd tolerate no more from a mistress
than a minister or a housemaid.

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,555
It's my way of respecting love.

218
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,711
You talk of being slighted.

219
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,512
Have I slighted you?

220
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,995
I know how sweet you are.

221
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,554
You're a little hand-reared bird.

222
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,750
But maybe unconsciously,
by persisting in being late,

223
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,837
you're trying to force me
to live at your pace.

224
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,190
Trying to bring me to heel,
dominate me.

225
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,992
That's what I cannot forgive.

226
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,838
I'm trying this, I'm trying that!

227
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,189
Isn't there something
you'd like to try?

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,155
With a woman you love
and who loves you?

229
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,432
You know very well
the power you have over me!

230
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,711
If you were thoughtful,
you'd refrain from abusing it.

231
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,350
- Take a plum and kiss me.
- I won't take a plum or kiss you!

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,152
We've fallen out.

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,518
Maybe we have.
But you can still have a plum.

234
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,033
I will have it.

235
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,594
I won't deprive myself of both.

236
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,189
But make no mistake!
This plum commits me to nothing.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,719
I'm so happy to see
you're not too stupid!

238
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,839
I'm so sad to see you losing
your best friend through stupidity.

239
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,397
I didn't know there were 3 of us

240
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,078
in this flat.

241
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,597
Throw it away.

242
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,552
Along with our love,
worm-eaten by your tardiness.

243
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,791
See? You didn't tell me
to eat the worm with the plum.

244
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,035
Forget my lateness!

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,673
Now come and kiss me.

246
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,438
Why shouldn't I, since I love you?

247
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,359
It's so good.

248
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,634
Not even dying could be so good.

249
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,389
Let me smell your neck,
your breath, your hair...

250
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,073
After that long wait,
when I thought I'd lost you.

251
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,152
Last night I saw a shooting star.

252
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,320
But I'm so silly,
I couldn't think of a wish to make.

253
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,232
Just before it burned out,
I said your name.

254
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,678
Very quickly, just your first name,

255
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,033
thinking the good Lord
would understand.

256
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,197
Your arms, warm in winter
and cool in summer...

257
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,751
You were always just right.

258
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,513
All our long,
tireless conversations...

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,878
Our hearts drawing nearer
and touching like hands.

260
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
And then the madness
of that other world...

261
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,910
You, arching back,
full of delicious cries...

262
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,037
Every kindness,

263
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,752
every perfection.

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,391
And in 8 months, you never once
asked me to marry you!

265
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,476
And now it all seems far away.

266
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,270
Shrouded, blurred.

267
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,270
I'm gazing at our reflection
in the bottom of a well.

268
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,198
How strange it is,
to make oneself suffer,

269
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,557
to create one's own unappiness.

270
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,835
Having blithely stabbed others,

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,519
do we yearn
to feel the blade ourselves?

272
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,032
Is there pleasure
to be gained?

273
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,150
When we press certain wounds,

274
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,555
do we not feel both
pleasure and pain?

275
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,430
What pleasure? What pain?

276
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,030
You talk and talk...

277
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,559
You blather on.

278
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,438
Or perhaps you're joking.

279
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,033
If I stopped talking for a second

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,310
I'd feel sadder still.

281
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,397
Sad?

282
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,839
But why?

283
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,750
It's as if you're talking
in a dream.

284
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,918
"O, name too beautiful to speak
except within a dream!"

285
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,593
Name?

286
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,632
What name?

287
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,192
Yours.

288
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,437
Rosette.

289
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,270
Why don't you love me?

290
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,149
You asked me that, coquettishly,

291
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,477
whenever I most proved I loved you.

292
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,952
And now you're asking me seriously.

293
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,030
Kiss me again.

294
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,353
Reassure me!

295
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,834
You're behaving so strangely today.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,433
Poor child.

297
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,240
Whenever my eyes meet yours,
you smile.

298
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,919
Whenever I kiss you, you smile.

299
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,070
Your lips turn as white

300
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,749
as an olive tree swept by the wind.

301
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,755
You won't understand either
till the very end.

302
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,638
Go now, Rosette.

303
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,153
Leave.

304
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,554
Let's not prolong
this misunderstanding.

305
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,274
Go?

306
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,917
Have you forgotten what I said
when you arrived?

307
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,430
You're still thinking about that?

308
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,478
I never stopped.

309
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,032
So you've put on an affectionate act
for an hour,

310
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,753
only to toss me aside
like a cheap slut?

311
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,952
Pierre says sincerity never rings true
in people's ears. He's right.

312
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,639
For the last time, I love you.

313
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,395
Can't you see it in my face?

314
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,636
I love you,
but I suppose I love myself more.

315
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,479
I'll lose my self-respect
if I let you go on slighting me.

316
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,910
So, with head held high,
I'll choose pain

317
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,712
over shame-faced happiness.

318
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,115
Enough of this hypocrisy!

319
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,836
I don't believe a single word,
a single reason you've given me!

320
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,997
You're bored. You want no more
of me. That's your right.

321
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,918
No explanations.

322
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,351
Explanations are indeed useless.

323
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,749
Alas, I am young. How will I live
in a world where my motives

324
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,634
are as obscure to my peers
as they would be to an ox?

325
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,355
Or a horse?

326
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,228
Are you crying?

327
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,793
Don't touch me!

328
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,512
Close the curtains.
I don't want you to see me cry.

329
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,398
I'll cry too, when you've gone.

330
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,112
But go, Rosette.

331
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,991
I can't bear it any longer.

332
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,712
I'm going.

333
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,029
You vaunt your pride.
Don't you think I have mine?

334
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,149
Do you think I'll come back
when you call?

335
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,033
Go.

336
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,753
Have you really thought about this?

337
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,756
Do you know what you're losing?

338
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,199
What I lose with you
I'll gain elsewhere.

339
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,149
If you only knew
how you disgust me!

340
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,078
I understand that.

341
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,556
My reasons obviously escape you.

342
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,590
But I'm swayed by them.
I admire myself tremendously.

343
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,995
You admire yourself tremendously?

344
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,519
No mars ever done what I'm doing!

345
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,955
And all for a few late arrivals.

346
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,434
So?

347
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,868
Adieu.

348
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,317
Adieu, then.

349
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,555
I'm sick of being with a madman!

350
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,193
Oh, Pierre!

351
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,069
I was in the cafe. I couldn't
take my eyes off your door.

352
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,750
I imagined you in each other's arms,
and then out came Rosette in tears.

353
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,798
You're upset, too.

354
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,912
There's still time,
say the word and I'll go after her!

355
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,949
No.

356
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,588
Two souls blissfully collide,

357
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,757
a miracle happens,
then one of them ruins it,

358
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,360
through absurdity and obstinacy.

359
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,476
We know philosophers are fools.
I had to learn along the way

360
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,751
that men of character
are fools, too.

361
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,637
Now you're bound to her
by the wrong you've done her.

362
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,992
She'll prey on your mind eternally.

363
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,510
You'll eternally wonder
if you were right or wrong.

364
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,120
Her tears will eternally
flow within you.

365
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,833
If you return to her,
it will be in shame.

366
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,758
If you don't,
it will be with remorse.

367
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,588
Those are the rewards
of your mock heroics.

368
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,836
What am I saying?

369
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,956
Is there any question
of you not returning to her?

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,834
Two days from now, as you awake,
her explanations

371
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,952
will suddenly seem so simple
and plausible

372
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,198
that your trumped-up case
against her will collapse.

373
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,637
You'll find nothing more
to reproach her for.

374
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,038
The grounds for your severity
will be lost to you, like a dream.

375
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,113
And when she comes back,
you'll fall into her arms.

376
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,354
It will end in delicious kisses

377
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,517
apologies given and accepted.

378
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,435
The classic lovers' tiff,

379
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,994
which leads
to passionate reconciliation,

380
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,239
just as losing an object
leads to the joy of finding it.

381
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,033
We begin in the sublime,
and descend into the ridiculous.

382
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,995
So all my courage will be wasted?

383
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,670
Courage is always wasted.

384
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,713
We'll see.
