1
00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.123
Billy! You get
number three up now!

2
00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:03.667
Don't come in to
eat before you do.

3
00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:12.134
Check the other two. Make
sure they're wired up good.

4
00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:16.388
I don't want them blowin' over
again, the first big wind.

5
00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:25.731
Lot of good they're doin'.

6
00:02:51.173 --> 00:02:54.134
Billy, you been messing
with the post puncher?

7
00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:55.635
No!

8
00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.764
I told you what would happen if
you screw around with this thing.

9
00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:00.599
I said I didn't!

10
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.649
Don't want 'em
blowin' down again.

11
00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:11.276
Big wind, my ass.

12
00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:14.279
You're the only
big wind out here.

13
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.574
Jacky!

14
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.703
You been messing with the
damn post puncher again?

15
00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:22.954
No!

16
00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:31.588
Billy, you little asshole! Why don't
you rat yourself out for a change?

17
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:33.131
What did I do?

18
00:03:33.215 --> 00:03:34.216
You little butt sniff.

19
00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.885
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

20
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:38.512
You Wish!

21
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.990
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Macky boy.

22
00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:01.636
God! Would you shut up?

23
00:05:42.135 --> 00:05:43.428
Jacky!

24
00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:46.264
Jacky!

25
00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:48.683
Jacky!

26
00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:55.065
Jacky!

27
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.429
Billy!

28
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:32.060
Where are you?

29
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:34.229
Billy!

30
00:06:35.146 --> 00:06:36.690
Daddy!

31
00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:38.692
Billy!

32
00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:46.575
Let go! Help me, Dad!

33
00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:47.826
Billy!

34
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.454
Help! Help, help, Dad, help!

35
00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:53.248
Billy!

36
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.293
Help! Help me! Dad!

37
00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:00.505
Billy!

38
00:07:01.172 --> 00:07:03.592
Dad! Let go!

39
00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:04.759
Billy!

40
00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:06.511
Daddy!

41
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:07.887
Billy!

42
00:07:51.723 --> 00:07:54.017
<i>Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!</i>

43
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.980
<i>Go Bantams! Go Bantams!</i>

44
00:07:59.064 --> 00:08:01.900
Go Bantams!

45
00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:05.904
Tough as nails, hard as rocks,

46
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:07.989
we are Bannon's fighting cocks!

47
00:08:08.073 --> 00:08:10.325
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

48
00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:12.494
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

49
00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:14.788
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

50
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:16.915
Bannon County's death machine!

51
00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:21.544
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

52
00:08:21.628 --> 00:08:23.672
Bannon Bantams power and might!

53
00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:26.007
Bannon Bantams, fight, fight, fight!
Incoming!

54
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:28.051
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

55
00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:30.345
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

56
00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:32.389
Down the court,
we'll clean your clock.

57
00:08:32.472 --> 00:08:34.599
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

58
00:08:34.683 --> 00:08:39.020
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

59
00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:41.106
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

60
00:08:41.189 --> 00:08:43.191
Bannon Bantams.
Kill! Kill! Kill!

61
00:08:43.274 --> 00:08:45.276
Who was that? Don't even ask!

62
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.237
These big Bantams
kick your ass!

63
00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:49.531
Strike like
lightning from the sky!

64
00:08:49.614 --> 00:08:51.408
Screaming out our battle cry!

65
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:56.204
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!
Go Bantams!

66
00:08:56.287 --> 00:08:58.540
Go Bantams!

67
00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:01.626
Go Bantams!

68
00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:13.388
Hard as rocks, we are
Bannon's fighting cocks!

69
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.724
How long can they keep this up?

70
00:09:15.807 --> 00:09:18.893
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

71
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.981
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

72
00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:28.236
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

73
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:31.239
I have a feeling he didn't
get to play enough.

74
00:09:31.322 --> 00:09:34.200
Well, shouldn't you
be sitting with him?

75
00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:37.495
After a game, he says he
needs to be with the guys.

76
00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:39.497
You kill his post-game buzz?

77
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:41.249
Basically.

78
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:44.085
If they lose, it's a
totally different thing.

79
00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:45.462
Can't pry him off me.

80
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.605
Shit!

81
00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:08.735
Okay, everybody stay down.
Sit tight.

82
00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:13.448
Son of a bitch.

83
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.383
What in the hell
would you call that?

84
00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:37.555
Ouch!

85
00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:39.849
I don't know, but
whatever it is,

86
00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.018
it's sharp as a son of a bitch!

87
00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:52.737
What in the hell
are we looking at?

88
00:10:53.738 --> 00:10:55.824
It's sharp enough to flatten
a tire, whatever it is.

89
00:10:55.907 --> 00:10:58.034
You know how thick
that rubber is?

90
00:10:58.117 --> 00:10:59.953
It had to be shot into
it like a bullet.

91
00:11:00.036 --> 00:11:02.455
Jesus Christ! The damn
thing has got teeth in it.

92
00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:06.042
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

93
00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.504
Driver can't change a flat on a bus.
They need a mechanic.

94
00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:11.464
- So?
- So?

95
00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:14.008
Do you see any
mechanics around here?

96
00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:15.635
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre,

97
00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:18.513
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

98
00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:22.773
<i>Where she'll
give us the latest update on...</i>

99
00:11:22.851 --> 00:11:23.852
Izzy.

100
00:11:23.935 --> 00:11:28.189
<i>A continuing story we call,
"The Horror in Poho County."</i>

101
00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:29.816
- <i>Sheila?
- Hey, Poho update.</i>

102
00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.026
<i>Well, Peter, the fire
which gutted an old church</i>

103
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.112
<i>south of Pertwilla
four days ago,</i>

104
00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.865
<i>continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.</i>

105
00:11:36.948 --> 00:11:39.450
<i>County sheriffs excavating
the charred ruins say</i>

106
00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:43.329
<i>the body count is
now up well past 300.</i>

107
00:11:43.413 --> 00:11:46.708
<i>County coroners say the bodies
were found stitched to each other,</i>

108
00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:49.711
<i>covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.</i>

109
00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:51.713
<i>One on-the-scene
witness called it</i>

110
00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:55.049
a <i>human tapestry
of torture and sadism</i>

111
00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:57.719
<i>and a sight he
will never forget.</i>

112
00:11:57.802 --> 00:12:00.346
<i>Sheila, the details keep
getting stranger and stranger</i>

113
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.349
<i>every day this week, it seems.
Any new information?</i>

114
00:12:03.433 --> 00:12:07.228
<i>Some of the corpses they had
found had false teeth made out of wood.</i>

115
00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:11.983
<i>That means some of the bodies they're
finding down there are over 200 years old.</i>

116
00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:14.736
<i>But, Peter, it's the
condition of the cadavers</i>

117
00:12:14.819 --> 00:12:16.738
<i>that's the strangest
fact of all.</i>

118
00:12:16.821 --> 00:12:19.073
<i>The County coroner's
office reported yesterday</i>

119
00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:22.201
<i>that they have yet to find
any one complete body.</i>

120
00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:24.162
Believe that, man?
No, they're making it up.

121
00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:26.706
<i>Each one missing either an
external limb or an internal organ.</i>

122
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:27.916
<i>What connection this has...</i>

123
00:12:30.126 --> 00:12:34.297
This is 226 on East Nine.
We are down and disabled.

124
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.924
Home base, do you read me?

125
00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:39.177
You get a good look at
the points on this thing?

126
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.180
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

127
00:12:42.722 --> 00:12:46.643
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

128
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.207
Pop! Pop, he dropped something.

129
00:13:56.421 --> 00:13:57.672
Pop?

130
00:14:00.258 --> 00:14:02.593
It was out in the corn, Papa.

131
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:05.596
Here, look at it.

132
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.388
We're out on East Nine. We
are down and disabled. Come back.

133
00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:34.519
Say again, this is 226.

134
00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:35.770
Anyone read me?

135
00:15:35.853 --> 00:15:39.232
We are down and disabled
out on East Nine. Come back.

136
00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:47.073
We gotta be in some kind
of sun spot or something.

137
00:15:47.156 --> 00:15:48.741
There's no signal getting out.

138
00:15:48.825 --> 00:15:50.910
It's gonna be
dark in about an hour.

139
00:15:50.993 --> 00:15:53.037
Well, we still got
five tires on the ground,

140
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:57.208
which means we can probably limp
home if we keep to goin' slow.

141
00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:02.880
Say again. This is 226.
Anyone read me?

142
00:16:02.964 --> 00:16:05.216
All of you at the same time?

143
00:16:06.676 --> 00:16:09.887
Lady cheerleaders?

144
00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:12.765
That's not smoke
I smell, is it?

145
00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:15.101
Minxie.

146
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.645
There's not a girl
in the world these days

147
00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:21.899
stupid enough to kill themselves
by sucking on cancer sticks.

148
00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:23.401
Am I right?

149
00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:32.577
Back on the bus, ladies.

150
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:44.338
You saw me, right?
Run that fast break?

151
00:16:44.422 --> 00:16:45.923
You see that?

152
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:49.468
Yeah, I saw it.
Anybody gonna read about it?

153
00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:54.307
Why you give old Dante
back there so much ink?

154
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:57.977
I'm serious.

155
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.062
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

156
00:17:00.146 --> 00:17:02.023
Really? I heard that was you.

157
00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:03.900
Hey, it's okay if you are, man.

158
00:17:03.983 --> 00:17:05.902
I mean, live and
let love, right?

159
00:17:05.985 --> 00:17:08.446
Why don't you piss on
somebody else's shoes, Jake?

160
00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:11.157
Hey, shouldn't you be folding towels
somewhere or sniffing jock straps?

161
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.868
You think you can manage
the team, Super Genius?

162
00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:16.662
Was I even talking to you,
Jock Strap Boy?

163
00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:18.748
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

164
00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:23.252
So this is all because what, I
don't write enough about you?

165
00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:25.914
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

166
00:17:25.963 --> 00:17:27.131
No, tell me.

167
00:17:27.215 --> 00:17:30.593
You got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

168
00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:31.761
So?

169
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:33.930
A gay bar, bro.

170
00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:38.851
You do know what they call
you, don't you, Izzy?

171
00:17:38.935 --> 00:17:40.144
That's my name.

172
00:17:40.228 --> 00:17:42.146
Or isn't he?

173
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:51.822
Hey, let's not make this a
social event out there, everybody.

174
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.951
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving.

175
00:17:55.034 --> 00:17:56.911
Hey, does that
come in a man's size?

176
00:17:56.994 --> 00:18:00.331
That means you, too,
Kimball. Let's go!

177
00:18:40.246 --> 00:18:43.040
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

178
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.044
Tippi Hedren, man!

179
00:18:47.128 --> 00:18:48.296
Kimball!

180
00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:51.757
Stop clowning around and
get your ass back on the bus!

181
00:18:53.718 --> 00:18:57.305
Off the top, gentlemen.
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

182
00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:59.552
You know, you could talk about it.
It might help a little bit.

183
00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:03.722
What did I play today,
12 minutes?

184
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:06.517
Well, it was
a great 12 minutes.

185
00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.770
Hanna's got it in for me.

186
00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:13.858
Him and his little token
white boy, Barnes.

187
00:21:15.693 --> 00:21:17.153
I don't know,

188
00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:21.991
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

189
00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:25.327
I know you don't mean that.

190
00:21:26.704 --> 00:21:28.247
Maybe they just
wanted to make sure

191
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.832
everyone got a chance
to play in the championship.

192
00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:33.294
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

193
00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:37.923
Half the losers on this bus had nothing
to do with us making it to state. I did.

194
00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:42.052
What the fuck
are you looking at?

195
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:48.762
Jesus!

196
00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:50.347
Jesus Christ!

197
00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:14.705
Don't tell me.

198
00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:15.988
- We blew the other one.
- How?

199
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:20.085
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

200
00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:24.006
Shit! We've got to break out the
flares and get these kids off the bus.

201
00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:27.509
Hey, hey, hey!

202
00:24:27.593 --> 00:24:29.637
You wanna sit in here and hope
somebody doesn't come along

203
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.722
plowin' into us doing 90,

204
00:24:32.973 --> 00:24:36.226
All right. Duane,
you clear the bus.

205
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.645
I'll set the flares.

206
00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:41.398
What is that, a flare gun?

207
00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:45.110
Plan on being lost
at sea in this thing?

208
00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:46.820
You makin' fun of my lock box?

209
00:24:46.904 --> 00:24:51.075
'Cause everything in this thing has
saved my sweet ass at least once.

210
00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:54.286
I don't believe it.

211
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:00.042
All right. Bring your coats
and stay in a group.

212
00:25:05.923 --> 00:25:08.509
This is Betty Borman
out on 226.

213
00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:11.595
We're broke down on East Nine, middle
of Kissel County. Anyone read me?

214
00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:14.139
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

215
00:25:14.223 --> 00:25:15.383
I don't think we can move it.

216
00:25:15.432 --> 00:25:17.476
It's on a bare rim in the back.

217
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.521
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

218
00:25:20.604 --> 00:25:21.772
Sure.

219
00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:40.207
Come on, guys. Come on.
Let's go. Off the road.

220
00:25:42.793 --> 00:25:48.257
Come on, guys. Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

221
00:25:49.675 --> 00:25:51.802
This side of the fence.

222
00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:55.055
This side of the fence.

223
00:25:55.139 --> 00:25:57.141
Scott, come on.

224
00:26:03.939 --> 00:26:06.817
Everyone stays back
and off the road. Now!

225
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:12.740
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

226
00:26:17.703 --> 00:26:18.996
Oh, God.

227
00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:24.168
Don't tell me that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

228
00:26:25.002 --> 00:26:26.670
Minxie, stay off the road.

229
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:30.257
That's everybody. Off the road.

230
00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:33.719
Get everyone back on the bus.

231
00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:35.929
You just said they shouldn't be...
I know what I just said.

232
00:26:36.013 --> 00:26:39.475
But there's something goin' on
out here and I don't like it.

233
00:26:39.558 --> 00:26:40.601
I think if we just stay...

234
00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:10.297
Coach?

235
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.553
What the...

236
00:27:20.224 --> 00:27:21.642
What?

237
00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:23.894
Where the hell's the coach?

238
00:27:24.561 --> 00:27:25.813
Charlie?

239
00:27:33.278 --> 00:27:34.530
Charlie!

240
00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:46.667
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

241
00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:49.920
Okay, champions, getting
back on the Betty Boop.

242
00:27:50.003 --> 00:27:51.964
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

243
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:53.382
I'm talking to you, Scotty!

244
00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:54.591
What the hell happened
to the coach?

245
00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:58.011
Get everyone back on board
and close those doors.

246
00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:02.349
Do it, Scotty.

247
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.483
All right. You heard him. Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.

248
00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:15.320
Charlie?

249
00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:18.907
Charlie!

250
00:28:22.953 --> 00:28:25.873
Hurry up! On the bus.
Now! Now! Now!

251
00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:27.708
I repeat. Bus number 226,

252
00:28:27.791 --> 00:28:29.793
broke down on East Nine.
Charlie!

253
00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:32.838
We have an emergency situation out here.
Does anybody read me?

254
00:28:36.466 --> 00:28:39.469
This is bus number 226. We
are broke down on East Nine.

255
00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:20.052
Jake.

256
00:29:27.017 --> 00:29:29.019
What happened?

257
00:29:29.978 --> 00:29:32.230
What did you see?
What did you see?

258
00:29:32.314 --> 00:29:34.733
Come on! Did you see
something or not?

259
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:39.363
She flew away.

260
00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:44.368
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

261
00:29:44.493 --> 00:29:46.578
What I just said. People
don't fly the fuck away!

262
00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:48.705
Sit down, Scott. What the
hell's goin' on out there?

263
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:52.209
I said sit the fuck down and
shut up, God damn it! Now!

264
00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:58.715
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

265
00:30:09.726 --> 00:30:11.520
Go sit down, Scott.

266
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:14.815
You got a problem with me?
No. You got one with me?

267
00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:17.150
- Do I what?
- You heard me.

268
00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:19.987
We don't have time for bullshit, Scotty.
Go sit down!

269
00:30:37.587 --> 00:30:38.797
Scotty!

270
00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:42.259
What the fuck?

271
00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:53.603
Get the fucking doors! Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

272
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.394
What was it?

273
00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:38.648
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

274
00:31:40.484 --> 00:31:41.485
Scotty, come on!

275
00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:44.988
Scotty, we just... I don't
know what it was, all right?

276
00:31:58.543 --> 00:32:00.170
It had wings.

277
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.840
Big fuckin' wings!

278
00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:30.367
<i>Central, this is unit 17.</i>

279
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.702
<i>We did a drive-by
of the general area.</i>

280
00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:35.872
<i>Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.</i>

281
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.335
<i>0-3-2, we are 10-7 Opper's
Diner for a little coffee and pie.</i>

282
00:32:40.418 --> 00:32:42.504
<i>Do you copy that, Central?</i>

283
00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:46.216
<i>This is Central.
Copy that, 0-3-2.</i>

284
00:32:48.844 --> 00:32:53.640
<i>All units, anybody else getting
some weird stuff out Kissel County way?</i>

285
00:32:53.723 --> 00:32:58.061
<i>I just got two calls, 10 miles
apart, both reporting abductions.</i>

286
00:32:58.145 --> 00:33:02.983
<i>All units, be informed,
this should be strictly 10-36 information.</i>

287
00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.153
<i>Someone burning a
marijuana field out there tonight?</i>

288
00:33:06.236 --> 00:33:08.530
<i>'Cause these two stories
are way, way out, baby.</i>

289
00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:10.949
<i>Roger that, 0-3-6.</i>

290
00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:12.868
Jacky! Kissel County!

291
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:16.413
<i>If you ask me, this is Poho related.
Repeat, Poho related.</i>

292
00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:18.099
<i>And you all
know what I'm talkin' about.</i>

293
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.336
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

294
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.505
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

295
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:29.551
We are stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

296
00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:31.511
And we are in serious trouble.

297
00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:33.221
Do you read me?

298
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:40.061
Come on, is anybody
even out there?

299
00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:41.229
This is Andy Buck.

300
00:33:41.313 --> 00:33:45.859
We are stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

301
00:33:47.027 --> 00:33:48.320
Javelins?

302
00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:51.281
We've got spears on this bus?

303
00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:53.200
Sticks.

304
00:33:53.283 --> 00:33:55.911
You wanna wait around so you can
poke at that thing with sticks?

305
00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:57.662
That thing shows up here
again and I'd rather have

306
00:33:57.746 --> 00:33:59.506
a sharp stick in my hand
than nothin' at all.

307
00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:04.461
Hey, guys, Betty's flare gun.
A bunch of flares for it, too.

308
00:34:05.128 --> 00:34:07.672
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

309
00:34:08.423 --> 00:34:11.009
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus?

310
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:14.596
You see that?

311
00:34:16.514 --> 00:34:18.850
That means that there's a farm down
at the end of this road somewhere

312
00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:22.103
and that's as far as anybody
would have to get to.

313
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:27.025
With that thing out there?

314
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.237
Scotty!

315
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.822
With that thing out there?

316
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:35.200
Scotty! That thing
hasn't been back

317
00:34:35.283 --> 00:34:36.326
here in almost an hour.

318
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:38.536
That doesn't mean that it's
not still up there somewhere.

319
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.163
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

320
00:34:40.247 --> 00:34:42.287
Hey, this isn't about who
can run the fastest, okay?

321
00:34:42.332 --> 00:34:44.084
Or being a pussy.
What is your problem?

322
00:34:44.167 --> 00:34:45.377
You tell me, Izzy or isn't he?

323
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.586
Hey, check yourselves!
Both of you!

324
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.712
Do I make you nervous?

325
00:34:47.796 --> 00:34:49.047
Thinking you're
gonna come on to me

326
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.049
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

327
00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:53.260
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too.

328
00:34:54.636 --> 00:34:57.055
Stop it!

329
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:59.266
Stop it!

330
00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:01.059
Scotty, come on.

331
00:35:05.981 --> 00:35:08.692
You get that hand off of me or we're gonna
have one more missing person out here.

332
00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:10.485
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus

333
00:35:10.568 --> 00:35:13.321
that's more important
than sticking together.

334
00:35:13.405 --> 00:35:15.782
It's the only way we're
gonna get through this.

335
00:35:15.865 --> 00:35:18.368
You wanna play cock
of the walk now?

336
00:35:19.703 --> 00:35:21.454
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

337
00:35:21.538 --> 00:35:24.207
Big K, sit. I'm serious.

338
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.584
Wanna play
cock of the walk, bro?

339
00:35:30.297 --> 00:35:33.341
Why do I think you wanna
call me something else?

340
00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:38.013
Wanna call me something else,
Scotty?

341
00:35:38.096 --> 00:35:40.682
'Cause I don't think you get
I can see you thinking it,

342
00:35:40.765 --> 00:35:41.808
whether you say it or not.

343
00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:43.611
Just stop it right now!
Both of you stop it.

344
00:35:46.062 --> 00:35:49.024
You guys all worked
together today to win a ball game.

345
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.068
Now that something
really serious happens,

346
00:35:52.152 --> 00:35:54.487
you can't even be
civil to each other?

347
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.740
You tell him, not me.

348
00:35:56.823 --> 00:35:59.576
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

349
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:01.953
We should all be looking for
ways we can defend ourselves

350
00:36:02.037 --> 00:36:04.205
until help gets here.

351
00:37:11.022 --> 00:37:12.732
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

352
00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:13.817
On what, the rims?

353
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.901
Can you drive
this thing or not?

354
00:37:14.984 --> 00:37:17.862
We wouldn't get two feet, man.
What do you want me to do?

355
00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:33.837
What the hell does it want?

356
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:38.967
What the fuck?

357
00:37:40.093 --> 00:37:42.011
Is it looking at me?

358
00:37:48.852 --> 00:37:52.730
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

359
00:38:07.871 --> 00:38:10.373
Get that light Off it.

360
00:39:14.896 --> 00:39:17.106
Hey, don't shoot that
thing in here, man.

361
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.431
He's right. It will fill this
place up like a smoke bomb.

362
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:26.783
Did that just
come off the door?

363
00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:28.868
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

364
00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:30.370
What, you think we're
gonna run outside?

365
00:39:30.453 --> 00:39:31.788
If it fucking comes inside.

366
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.354
Minxie?

367
00:39:58.648 --> 00:40:00.358
Minxie?

368
00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:10.034
Minxie? Minxie?

369
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:12.453
Minxie?

370
00:40:21.254 --> 00:40:22.630
Minxie?

371
00:41:12.263 --> 00:41:15.141
<i>Takes it all. Eats everything.</i>

372
00:41:15.224 --> 00:41:17.727
<i>He takes it all.
He knows no mercy.</i>

373
00:41:32.575 --> 00:41:36.204
Every twenty-third spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

374
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.043
Eat what?

375
00:41:45.963 --> 00:41:47.215
Eat what?

376
00:41:50.426 --> 00:41:52.428
Eat us.

377
00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:06.359
Minx?

378
00:42:09.445 --> 00:42:10.697
Are you okay?

379
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.616
Look at me.

380
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.119
I thought you were gone, girl,
you passed out.

381
00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:17.954
Look at me.

382
00:42:18.037 --> 00:42:19.372
Are you okay?

383
00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:23.501
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

384
00:42:23.584 --> 00:42:24.585
I think he's gone, man.

385
00:42:24.669 --> 00:42:26.629
I'm willing to bet money on it.

386
00:42:27.922 --> 00:42:31.300
You willing to bet stepping off this bus?
'Cause that's the real bet.

387
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:33.219
How long's it been?

388
00:42:34.846 --> 00:42:35.847
It's gone.

389
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.223
It came, it did its thing.
It went away.

390
00:42:37.306 --> 00:42:39.066
It went away, but
what the hell was it doing?

391
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.394
What do you think it was doing?

392
00:42:47.191 --> 00:42:49.068
He was picking people out.

393
00:42:54.657 --> 00:42:55.950
What?

394
00:42:57.076 --> 00:42:59.203
It can smell
something in people.

395
00:42:59.287 --> 00:43:00.288
In their fear.

396
00:43:00.371 --> 00:43:02.874
Something that helps
it pick people out.

397
00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.626
Pick people out for what?

398
00:43:06.502 --> 00:43:09.338
I don't understand how you
would know that, sweetie.

399
00:43:12.049 --> 00:43:14.010
A dead boy told me.

400
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.642
I think he was
trying to warn me.

401
00:43:22.602 --> 00:43:25.271
He was trying
to warn all of us.

402
00:43:26.022 --> 00:43:27.815
This thing has been around
for thousands of years

403
00:43:27.899 --> 00:43:29.942
and that nothing has
been able to kill it.

404
00:43:30.026 --> 00:43:31.152
This is a dream you had?

405
00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:33.988
Well, the boy was dead. So, yes, I'm
assuming that it was a dream, Scotty.

406
00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:36.073
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

407
00:43:36.157 --> 00:43:37.492
Now all of a sudden,
you're a psychic hotline?

408
00:43:37.575 --> 00:43:38.618
I don't know!

409
00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:41.412
You wanna explain it
to me? Because I can't.

410
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:50.463
That boy was trying to warn us

411
00:43:50.546 --> 00:43:53.382
that by morning it has to
go back into the earth...

412
00:43:53.466 --> 00:43:55.134
Oh, come on.

413
00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:58.513
Into the ground
for 23 more years.

414
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.060
And then what? Lives
happily ever after?

415
00:44:05.353 --> 00:44:06.979
Why don't you clean
out your bong, all right?

416
00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:08.606
Scotty, just listen to her.

417
00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:09.774
It is coming back.

418
00:44:09.857 --> 00:44:11.526
This is a dream
she had, Rhonda.

419
00:44:11.609 --> 00:44:12.610
What, are you gonna believe it?

420
00:44:12.693 --> 00:44:14.613
And it doesn't matter if
we're hiding on this bus

421
00:44:14.654 --> 00:44:17.365
or if we're
hiding under our beds.

422
00:44:17.448 --> 00:44:18.866
It'll find us.

423
00:44:20.618 --> 00:44:22.787
The ones that it picked out.

424
00:44:38.553 --> 00:44:41.472
Minx. Take it easy, okay?

425
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:49.063
The boy told me that

426
00:44:49.146 --> 00:44:51.691
it can smell in our fear,

427
00:44:51.774 --> 00:44:53.568
who it wants.

428
00:44:55.945 --> 00:44:58.573
And what from them

429
00:44:58.656 --> 00:45:00.616
it wants to eat.

430
00:45:14.463 --> 00:45:16.841
Hello, is anyone out there?

431
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.136
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

432
00:45:20.219 --> 00:45:23.639
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

433
00:45:23.723 --> 00:45:26.475
Is anybody out there, please?

434
00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:30.146
We have a... This is Andy Buck,
we have a serious situation...

435
00:46:27.536 --> 00:46:29.205
<i>Does anybody hear me?</i>

436
00:46:43.135 --> 00:46:44.762
Dad!

437
00:46:46.555 --> 00:46:49.558
Hello? Look, can you hear me?

438
00:46:49.642 --> 00:46:51.268
226, are you still there?

439
00:46:51.394 --> 00:46:52.645
<i>I'm so fucking still here.</i>

440
00:46:52.728 --> 00:46:55.648
Okay, okay. Just say again
what you just told me.

441
00:46:55.731 --> 00:46:57.131
<i>We're not playing
games here, right?</i>

442
00:46:57.191 --> 00:46:59.026
Just say it, man!

443
00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.781
We're trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

444
00:47:03.864 --> 00:47:05.616
And something
is going to kill us

445
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.494
if we don't get help
out here right away.

446
00:47:08.577 --> 00:47:09.912
Where on Nine East?

447
00:47:09.996 --> 00:47:11.956
<i>In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?</i>

448
00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.708
What's trying to kill you?

449
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:15.167
What are you talking about?

450
00:47:15.251 --> 00:47:17.420
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

451
00:47:17.503 --> 00:47:21.424
<i>Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the Nine.</i>

452
00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:24.093
But it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

453
00:47:24.176 --> 00:47:25.678
Are there any
landmarks near you?

454
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:27.263
Are you close to anything?

455
00:47:27.346 --> 00:47:29.515
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
my fucking pants, man.

456
00:47:29.598 --> 00:47:32.226
Can you just please tell
me that you're on the way?

457
00:47:33.269 --> 00:47:37.732
I can't really judge the strength of
your signal but it doesn't sound close.

458
00:47:37.815 --> 00:47:39.525
<i>What does that mean, man?</i>

459
00:47:39.608 --> 00:47:41.902
It means it's gonna take
me a while to get to you.

460
00:47:41.986 --> 00:47:45.781
Look, we kind of have a
time-critical situation here.

461
00:47:45.865 --> 00:47:47.533
Roger that.

462
00:47:47.616 --> 00:47:49.576
And please tell me that
you're coming with back-up

463
00:47:49.618 --> 00:47:51.203
'cause if you're not the cops,

464
00:47:51.287 --> 00:47:53.372
you gotta promise me
that you'll call them

465
00:47:53.456 --> 00:47:56.584
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

466
00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:58.294
I'll call them.

467
00:47:58.377 --> 00:48:00.046
I'll call them right now.

468
00:48:00.129 --> 00:48:01.964
But what you've
gotta do is hang on.

469
00:48:02.048 --> 00:48:03.382
Can you do that?

470
00:48:03.466 --> 00:48:04.800
Hang on!

471
00:48:16.145 --> 00:48:17.938
Keep headed east.

472
00:48:22.568 --> 00:48:24.111
Dad?

473
00:48:24.195 --> 00:48:25.988
Just get us out there.

474
00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:30.785
Do it.

475
00:48:49.845 --> 00:48:51.222
Yes!

476
00:49:04.026 --> 00:49:05.746
It's happening, man.
It's fucking happening!

477
00:49:05.778 --> 00:49:07.196
We're being fucking rescued!

478
00:49:10.282 --> 00:49:12.827
Help me! Get this thing off me!

479
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.340
Get this thing off me!

480
00:49:26.423 --> 00:49:27.591
Look out!

481
00:51:25.501 --> 00:51:27.670
Half its fucking head's gone.

482
00:51:43.185 --> 00:51:44.520
Fuck.

483
00:53:13.942 --> 00:53:15.110
You gotta be...

484
00:53:15.194 --> 00:53:16.945
Fucking kidding me.

485
00:54:05.536 --> 00:54:07.454
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

486
00:54:10.582 --> 00:54:11.750
It's dead, right?

487
00:54:11.834 --> 00:54:13.585
Don't know. Don't care.

488
00:54:13.669 --> 00:54:14.962
It won't open!

489
00:54:22.344 --> 00:54:24.680
Stop Pushing on 'em!
They open in!

490
00:54:26.682 --> 00:54:28.434
Something got screwed up!

491
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:39.570
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

492
00:54:39.653 --> 00:54:41.113
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

493
00:54:41.196 --> 00:54:43.365
Then you fucking open it, man!

494
00:54:43.449 --> 00:54:45.033
Get that door open.

495
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.880
How can fucking exits
not fucking work?

496
00:54:59.715 --> 00:55:02.134
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

497
00:55:02.676 --> 00:55:04.386
He jammed it.

498
00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:07.931
We thought he was
trying to come in.

499
00:55:08.015 --> 00:55:11.059
But this freaking thing was
making sure we couldn't get out.

500
00:55:19.568 --> 00:55:21.195
Break the fucking doors!

501
00:56:00.234 --> 00:56:02.277
Holy shit, man!

502
00:56:10.661 --> 00:56:12.829
Hey, we can
pry this thing open.

503
00:56:14.289 --> 00:56:16.792
Give me a pole or a bar
or something metal.

504
00:56:16.875 --> 00:56:19.878
Something big. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, that'll work.

505
00:56:31.974 --> 00:56:33.976
Come on, D.

506
00:56:34.059 --> 00:56:36.061
You need to get to this side.
Come on, everybody.

507
00:56:36.144 --> 00:56:37.604
Come on!

508
00:56:41.024 --> 00:56:43.151
This thing's like a fucking
shower curtain, man.

509
00:56:43.235 --> 00:56:44.820
It's crazy.

510
00:56:48.907 --> 00:56:51.785
Oh, man, show like
you got a pair.

511
00:56:51.868 --> 00:56:53.620
Man, fuck you!

512
00:56:56.999 --> 00:56:59.167
Everybody. Let's go.

513
00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:10.679
Shower curtain?

514
00:57:10.762 --> 00:57:13.599
This thing's like a fucking
piece of toilet paper.

515
00:58:36.098 --> 00:58:37.766
What's it doing, Minx?

516
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:39.935
What's it doing, Minx?

517
00:58:40.894 --> 00:58:42.938
What's it doing up there?

518
00:59:15.679 --> 00:59:17.723
It just tore its head off.

519
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.432
It's time to go.

520
01:00:45.393 --> 01:00:47.187
What are you talking about, man?
Help is coming.

521
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.648
The Nine is big.

522
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:51.233
Remember?

523
01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.736
What if he's an hour away?

524
01:00:55.612 --> 01:00:57.322
What if he's going
the wrong direction?

525
01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:59.366
There are fucking
cops on the way, man.

526
01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:01.785
And you want the rest of us to
sit underneath that big hole

527
01:01:01.868 --> 01:01:05.372
in the roof and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

528
01:01:06.665 --> 01:01:08.026
What do you mean,
"The rest of us"?

529
01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:09.543
I mean...

530
01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:12.754
It's time to stop being polite.

531
01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:16.758
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

532
01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:20.679
It had its pick of
twenty of us back there

533
01:01:20.762 --> 01:01:22.264
and it picked two.

534
01:01:23.598 --> 01:01:25.016
Dante was one.

535
01:01:27.102 --> 01:01:28.982
Another one was you, Jake.
God damn it, Scott...

536
01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:31.773
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

537
01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:36.194
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

538
01:01:36.278 --> 01:01:38.154
Two classes of people?

539
01:01:38.238 --> 01:01:40.532
What, the will be eaten
and the won't be eaten?

540
01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.325
Fuck you, Scotty!

541
01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:47.163
Minxie says this thing gets anybody
it picks out, no matter what.

542
01:01:47.247 --> 01:01:48.790
Don't put me in this.

543
01:01:48.874 --> 01:01:50.458
She also said
that after tonight

544
01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:53.128
it goes away and
for a long time, Scott.

545
01:01:53.962 --> 01:01:56.464
You tell us, Minxie.

546
01:01:56.548 --> 01:01:59.593
Are we safe if we can
hide out till morning?

547
01:01:59.676 --> 01:02:01.261
Or is this thing gonna
come after these guys

548
01:02:01.344 --> 01:02:02.387
with everything it's got

549
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:04.472
'cause it only
has till morning?

550
01:02:14.816 --> 01:02:16.484
We're screwed, right?

551
01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:22.824
Yeah.

552
01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:24.826
Scotty.

553
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:27.370
You're not talking about
throwing people off this bus?

554
01:02:27.454 --> 01:02:28.775
It's funny you
should say that, D,

555
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.390
'cause the only other one we know
it picked out for sure was you.

556
01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:32.584
Hold on a second!

557
01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.920
We all saw the way it
sniffed you out back there.

558
01:02:35.003 --> 01:02:37.684
You were the only one it gave tongue
action, man, and we all saw it.

559
01:02:37.714 --> 01:02:39.424
Scotty!

560
01:02:39.507 --> 01:02:42.010
I don't understand what
you're trying to do.

561
01:02:42.093 --> 01:02:43.470
I'm trying to stay alive.

562
01:02:43.553 --> 01:02:45.263
You're trying to split us up!

563
01:02:45.347 --> 01:02:47.891
We have just dropped a notch

564
01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:50.518
on the fucking food chain, man.

565
01:02:54.522 --> 01:02:58.109
This is about
living or dying now.

566
01:02:58.193 --> 01:02:59.611
Okay?

567
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:02.781
And if this bus
is the only thing

568
01:03:02.864 --> 01:03:04.366
keeping that fucker
away from us,

569
01:03:04.449 --> 01:03:07.243
how safe are we, you guys?

570
01:03:07.327 --> 01:03:10.372
With everybody it's hungry
for sitting inside it.

571
01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:16.586
I wanna see hands.

572
01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:21.633
I wanna see hands.

573
01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:26.304
'Cause as shitty a deal
as it is, I gotta say,

574
01:03:26.388 --> 01:03:28.181
I'd like you,

575
01:03:28.264 --> 01:03:31.518
Bucky and Jake
off this bus, man.

576
01:03:33.228 --> 01:03:35.730
Now, you listen to me,
you piece of shit!

577
01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:39.901
He looked at you, too, bro.

578
01:03:41.611 --> 01:03:43.738
I saw him and you did, too.

579
01:03:44.781 --> 01:03:47.951
He looked right
at you and smiled.

580
01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:51.538
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it,

581
01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:53.981
he could've looked at you twice
and licked its fucking lips,

582
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.583
but we don't know that.

583
01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:58.878
So you keep your
little black list.

584
01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:04.217
'Cause when he takes you
out and I hope he does,

585
01:04:05.635 --> 01:04:09.973
I'm gonna be the one getting as far
away from your sorry ass as I can.

586
01:04:15.937 --> 01:04:17.939
Time to go is right.

587
01:04:20.108 --> 01:04:21.776
I'm gonna go find that farm.

588
01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.361
Then I'm going with you.

589
01:04:23.445 --> 01:04:25.488
You know I'm coming.

590
01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:29.117
You wanna keep this bus?

591
01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:32.037
Then you sit in it.

592
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.830
Right under that big hole.

593
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.666
See how long you last.

594
01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:42.505
Look, I'm sorry, D.

595
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:44.507
You are so right about that.

596
01:04:48.845 --> 01:04:51.723
Come on, guys.

597
01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:54.559
Come on. Help is on the way.
Why are we splitting up?

598
01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:58.396
He said he was coming. We're gonna
leave and he's gonna pull up.

599
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.775
This bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

600
01:05:01.858 --> 01:05:03.610
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

601
01:05:03.693 --> 01:05:04.694
What, do you wanna go with them?

602
01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:06.237
We don't know
who it picked out.

603
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:08.823
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone!

604
01:05:12.327 --> 01:05:13.995
Scotty, let go of me.

605
01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:15.246
Let go of you?

606
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:17.082
Let go of me.

607
01:05:30.136 --> 01:05:31.346
Fuck!

608
01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:39.187
Rho, tell me you're
really walkin' away from me.

609
01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:42.565
You used me,
you used all of us.

610
01:05:42.649 --> 01:05:44.984
All you care about is yourself.

611
01:05:45.068 --> 01:05:48.363
Rho! You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

612
01:05:49.489 --> 01:05:52.117
When people get really scared, it's
just like when they get drunk.

613
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.619
The real person
comes to the surface.

614
01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:58.414
We could've protected D and Jake and
all of us if we'd stuck together.

615
01:05:58.498 --> 01:06:00.542
You know, like in a team?

616
01:06:01.668 --> 01:06:03.169
Hey!

617
01:06:18.143 --> 01:06:20.145
What are you doing?

618
01:06:20.228 --> 01:06:22.981
Jonny, you little cocksucker,
I will fucking fry you, man!

619
01:06:23.064 --> 01:06:25.984
You open these goddamn doors!
You open it right now!

620
01:06:26.067 --> 01:06:29.195
Jonny! Open
the fucking doors, man!

621
01:06:29.279 --> 01:06:30.905
Open the doors!

622
01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:35.034
This is my bus, too, man!

623
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.917
Run!

624
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.483
Oh, God!

625
01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:20.038
Run! He's right behind you, D.

626
01:07:27.962 --> 01:07:30.798
Get back! Get off! Break off!

627
01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:04.540
- Shit!
- Hold on. Hold on.

628
01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:06.960
Hold still!

629
01:08:08.294 --> 01:08:10.129
Stop moving! Stop!

630
01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:13.174
Come on, Scotty!
You're hurting him.

631
01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:15.593
You're hurting him.

632
01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:20.515
- Stop! Pull it out!
- Hold on! Hold on!

633
01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:23.893
Stop it! Keep back.
Stop moving!

634
01:08:23.977 --> 01:08:25.937
- It's in there like it's welded!
- Stop! Stop.

635
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.605
Pull that out!

636
01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:30.441
You're hurting him.
You're hurting him.

637
01:08:30.525 --> 01:08:31.985
Stop it! Scotty, stop it!

638
01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:34.988
- Shut up! Okay, hold him. Hold him.
- Scotty, stop it! Scotty!

639
01:08:35.071 --> 01:08:36.656
Scotty, hold still! Hold him!

640
01:08:36.739 --> 01:08:40.034
- Stop it! Scotty!
- Hold still!

641
01:08:48.334 --> 01:08:50.420
Oh, God! God!

642
01:08:52.505 --> 01:08:54.966
Please, hurry!
Oh, God, please help!

643
01:08:55.049 --> 01:08:57.635
D, I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry!

644
01:08:57.719 --> 01:08:59.804
Oh, please take it out!

645
01:09:09.147 --> 01:09:13.318
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!

646
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:17.530
Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! Scotty!

647
01:09:47.101 --> 01:09:49.270
What is it, boy? What is it?

648
01:09:58.571 --> 01:09:59.822
Papa!

649
01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:10.333
Go! Go!

650
01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:27.558
Where did you come from?

651
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.104
From that bus?

652
01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:34.482
How far up ahead?

653
01:10:38.486 --> 01:10:40.571
Come on. Answer me.

654
01:10:41.114 --> 01:10:42.865
It doesn't matter.

655
01:10:44.826 --> 01:10:48.037
There's no one on the bus
and you can't kill it.

656
01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:53.459
Jacky, get the dog inside.

657
01:10:55.128 --> 01:10:57.130
Look, you can't stop it!

658
01:10:57.422 --> 01:11:00.591
You get in the cabin with Jack Jr.
You stay down till this is over.

659
01:11:00.675 --> 01:11:02.552
This will never be over.

660
01:11:04.762 --> 01:11:07.014
It doesn't matter what you do.

661
01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:11.477
It'll be back,

662
01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:13.271
23 years from now,

663
01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:15.982
23 years from then.

664
01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:22.655
Get us to that bus.

665
01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:38.546
Jonny?

666
01:11:41.048 --> 01:11:42.258
Jonny?

667
01:11:51.726 --> 01:11:53.227
What was that?

668
01:11:59.025 --> 01:12:00.234
Jonny.

669
01:12:03.362 --> 01:12:07.116
Bucky! What're you doing here?

670
01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:09.410
What are you doing here?

671
01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:13.247
You let her in, Jonny?

672
01:12:18.085 --> 01:12:20.087
Have you seen anybody else?

673
01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:23.007
What are you doing?

674
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:26.677
That thing is after you, Bucky.

675
01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:29.514
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man. I must...

676
01:12:29.597 --> 01:12:31.682
I must've run 10 miles all
over this fucking valley.

677
01:12:31.766 --> 01:12:35.353
Bucky, come on.
Just please go away.

678
01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:39.815
No, please. Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

679
01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:43.402
It's fucking freaky
out there, man, please.

680
01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:12.468
Get around the bus.

681
01:15:23.771 --> 01:15:27.942
Jacky! Get us around this bus now.
Now!

682
01:15:28.776 --> 01:15:30.528
Get around the bus!

683
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.322
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there, now!

684
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:28.711
Jacky?

685
01:16:31.505 --> 01:16:33.048
You all right?

686
01:16:34.717 --> 01:16:36.927
Jacky, answer me!

687
01:16:38.137 --> 01:16:41.640
Jacky, answer me! Are you okay?

688
01:16:41.724 --> 01:16:43.809
<i>I</i> think so.

689
01:16:59.033 --> 01:17:01.285
Jacky, get us away from the bus!

690
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:06.123
Come on, go!
Get us away from the bus!

691
01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:10.336
<i>Get gem', Jacky, get gem'.
Get us away.</i>

692
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:12.880
Move it!

693
01:17:21.597 --> 01:17:22.723
Dad!

694
01:17:25.017 --> 01:17:26.435
Dad?

695
01:17:26.519 --> 01:17:27.603
Yeah?

696
01:17:37.029 --> 01:17:38.155
Dad!

697
01:17:52.962 --> 01:17:54.755
All you kids, get down.

698
01:19:10.247 --> 01:19:13.083
Jacky! Jacky!

699
01:19:13.751 --> 01:19:16.503
You try to get us away
from the bus! Now!

700
01:19:22.176 --> 01:19:23.469
Come on!

701
01:19:42.404 --> 01:19:43.864
Dad!

702
01:19:48.118 --> 01:19:49.328
Dad, get out of there!

703
01:19:49.411 --> 01:19:51.830
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

704
01:19:51.914 --> 01:19:53.290
Dad, just get out!

705
01:19:53.374 --> 01:19:56.210
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

706
01:19:56.293 --> 01:19:59.588
Get out, Dad. No, he'll rip my
gun right out of the truck!

707
01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:02.216
Dad, just get the
fuck out of there!

708
01:20:30.744 --> 01:20:33.747
Dad! Dad!

709
01:20:34.081 --> 01:20:35.249
Are you okay?

710
01:20:38.377 --> 01:20:39.753
Dad!

711
01:20:45.718 --> 01:20:46.802
Dad?

712
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:49.513
Dad!

713
01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:08.907
You're not gonna believe this. But
I think I found a way out of here.

714
01:21:13.245 --> 01:21:14.872
What?

715
01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:15.998
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

716
01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:18.542
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

717
01:21:20.753 --> 01:21:21.920
Right?

718
01:21:25.049 --> 01:21:26.925
The others
might've gotten away.

719
01:21:27.009 --> 01:21:28.635
We don't know that.

720
01:21:29.636 --> 01:21:31.138
Kimball, too.

721
01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:38.020
Hey, nobody gets
to decide we die.

722
01:21:38.103 --> 01:21:40.689
No dream, nobody. Nobody
gets to decide that.

723
01:21:40.773 --> 01:21:42.441
That is bullshit!

724
01:21:49.073 --> 01:21:50.407
I hope so.

725
01:21:52.785 --> 01:21:55.871
Come on, I wanna go show
you a big ugly bug.

726
01:22:01.502 --> 01:22:02.920
That's the truck
that passed us this morning.

727
01:22:03.003 --> 01:22:04.564
Remember, with the
big bug on top of it?

728
01:22:04.588 --> 01:22:05.964
You think we can just
drive away in it?

729
01:22:06.048 --> 01:22:08.133
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

730
01:22:08.217 --> 01:22:09.510
That's how I
got in my bar fight.

731
01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:10.761
I was tryin' to steal
somebody's truck.

732
01:22:10.844 --> 01:22:11.804
A gay bar?

733
01:22:13.055 --> 01:22:14.556
Jesus Christ!

734
01:22:19.686 --> 01:22:22.773
Wherever he was goin',
I don't think he made it.

735
01:22:28.195 --> 01:22:30.405
Oh, my God, the keys are in it!

736
01:22:31.448 --> 01:22:32.908
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

737
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:39.164
It's not birds.

738
01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:43.252
Fuck! Shit!

739
01:22:47.464 --> 01:22:50.884
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

740
01:22:50.968 --> 01:22:52.427
Come on.

741
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.888
Go, man! Go!

742
01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:07.192
I'm a sitting duck back
here, Izzy, step on it!

743
01:23:07.276 --> 01:23:08.735
I've got it floored!

744
01:23:08.819 --> 01:23:11.697
Go! Come on, go faster!
Make it go faster!

745
01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.073
I can't!

746
01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.704
Go! Go! Go, man!

747
01:23:18.787 --> 01:23:21.373
Go! Go! Izzy, go!

748
01:23:22.249 --> 01:23:26.211
Go! Izzy, move
this piece of shit!

749
01:23:26.295 --> 01:23:29.631
Come on! Come on! Move it!

750
01:23:29.715 --> 01:23:32.259
Izzy! Go! Go!

751
01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:45.522
Izzy, do something!

752
01:23:48.901 --> 01:23:50.027
Izzy!

753
01:23:50.611 --> 01:23:51.904
Get down!

754
01:23:55.282 --> 01:23:56.658
Izzy!

755
01:23:57.075 --> 01:24:00.662
Come on! Come on! Izzy!

756
01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:04.124
Do something,
fucking do something!

757
01:24:05.959 --> 01:24:07.544
- Get out!
- What?

758
01:24:07.628 --> 01:24:10.422
Come on! Come on! Come on!

759
01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:11.590
Get out.

760
01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:13.467
Are you fuckin' crazy?

761
01:24:14.635 --> 01:24:18.388
Izzy! Izzy! Come on! Izzy!

762
01:24:18.472 --> 01:24:19.806
Stay down!

763
01:24:21.725 --> 01:24:23.101
Stay down!

764
01:32:35.135 --> 01:32:36.636
It isn't dead.

765
01:32:42.016 --> 01:32:43.643
Its time ran out.

766
01:33:02.162 --> 01:33:03.913
It looks dead to me.

767
01:34:29.249 --> 01:34:30.667
You Taggart?

768
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.210
That's right.

769
01:34:34.254 --> 01:34:35.630
Can we see it?

770
01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.215
Can you read?

771
01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:48.226
Is this something real? I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

772
01:34:49.936 --> 01:34:51.604
Still five bucks.

773
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:56.442
Where'd it come from?

774
01:34:58.611 --> 01:35:00.196
My dad killed it.

775
01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.574
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

776
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:06.160
It's five bucks from you, too.

777
01:35:09.038 --> 01:35:10.707
How'd he kill it?

778
01:35:14.836 --> 01:35:16.087
Ask him.

779
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.126
Come on, man. We ought to
go get our money back.

780
01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:00.006
BOY 12 What the hell is it?

781
01:36:00.089 --> 01:36:02.342
What do you think it is?

782
01:36:11.309 --> 01:36:12.977
We don't touch it.

783
01:36:24.614 --> 01:36:26.866
What's the story on this thing?

784
01:36:28.034 --> 01:36:30.328
Whatever you've
heard. Probably.

785
01:36:31.579 --> 01:36:34.290
You expect us to think
that, that thing's real?

786
01:36:34.374 --> 01:36:36.042
Don't really care.

787
01:36:36.542 --> 01:36:38.211
How'd you kill it?

788
01:36:40.463 --> 01:36:42.924
Stabbed it right
through the heart

789
01:36:44.884 --> 01:36:47.929
with a big homemade harpoon.

790
01:36:56.396 --> 01:36:57.480
When?

791
01:36:59.065 --> 01:37:00.775
About 23 years ago.

792
01:37:04.696 --> 01:37:06.739
You waitin' for somethin'?

793
01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:12.704
About three more days,
