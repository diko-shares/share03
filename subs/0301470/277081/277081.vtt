1
00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.699
Billy?
Get number three up now.

2
00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:02.452
And don't come in to eat
before you do.

3
00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:08.708
And check the other two!

4
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.586
Make sure they're wired up good!

5
00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:15.715
I don't want 'em blowing over
again at the first big wind.

6
00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:24.891
Lot of good they're doing.

7
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:53.127
Billy, you been messing
with the post-puncher?

8
00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:54.545
No!

9
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:56.464
I told you what would happen...

10
00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.132
if you screw around
with this thing.

11
00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:00.051
I said I didn't!

12
00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.935
"l don't want 'em
blowin' down again."

13
00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:11.145
Big wind, my ass.

14
00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.731
You're the only big wind
out here.

15
00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:16.526
Jacky!

16
00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:20.571
You been messing with the damn
post-puncher again, huh?

17
00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:21.823
No.

18
00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:27.578
Billy, you little asshole!

19
00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:30.289
Why don't you rat yourself out
for a change?

20
00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:33.042
-What did I do?
-You little butt sniff!

21
00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.920
I ought to come out there
and kick your ass!

22
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:37.880
You wish!

23
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.234
Yeah, go on, Mac. Go bite him
in the ass for me, Mackie boy.

24
00:04:58.127 --> 00:05:00.880
God, would you shut up?

25
00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:42.547
Jacky!

26
00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:46.092
Jacky!

27
00:05:46.175 --> 00:05:47.677
Jacky!

28
00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:54.725
Jacky!

29
00:06:04.986 --> 00:06:07.154
-What?
-I don't know.

30
00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:12.702
What?

31
00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.463
Help!

32
00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:27.008
Billy!

33
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:29.260
Help! Help!

34
00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:33.180
Where are you? Billy!

35
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.100
Daddy!

36
00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:37.852
Billy!

37
00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:45.526
Let go! Help me, dad!

38
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:50.281
-Billy!
-Help! Help! Help!

39
00:06:50.406 --> 00:06:54.493
-Billy!
-Help! Dad! Help me!

40
00:06:58.372 --> 00:07:00.499
Billy!

41
00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:02.585
Stop it! Let go!

42
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.337
-Billy!
-Daddy!

43
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.423
Billy!

44
00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:12.011
Help!

45
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.594
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

46
00:07:53.677 --> 00:07:55.930
-Go!
-Louder!

47
00:07:56.013 --> 00:07:58.140
-Go!
-Louder!

48
00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:01.477
Go Bantams! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

49
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.980
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!

50
00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:07.274
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

51
00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:09.527
Fighting Bantams,
tough as nails!

52
00:08:09.652 --> 00:08:11.612
Bow down now or kiss our tails!

53
00:08:11.737 --> 00:08:13.948
Out for blood,
we're lean and mean!

54
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.116
Bannon County's death machine!

55
00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:18.202
Bannon Bantams! Bannon Bantams!

56
00:08:18.327 --> 00:08:20.538
Go Bantams!

57
00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:23.082
Bannon Bantams, power and might!

58
00:08:23.165 --> 00:08:24.250
Bannon Bantams,
fight, fight, fight!

59
00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:25.417
Incoming!

60
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:27.169
Bannon Bantams, we're the word!

61
00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:29.463
You don't mess
with a mighty bird!

62
00:08:29.588 --> 00:08:31.549
Down the court
we'll clean your clock!

63
00:08:31.674 --> 00:08:33.926
Better not mess
with the fighting cock!

64
00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:35.970
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

65
00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:37.805
Go Bantams!

66
00:08:37.888 --> 00:08:40.099
Bannon Bantams, wings of steel!

67
00:08:40.182 --> 00:08:42.184
Bannon Bantams,
kill, kill, kill!

68
00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.270
Who was that? Don't even ask!

69
00:08:44.353 --> 00:08:46.564
Big bad Bantams kick your ass!

70
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:52.861
Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams!

71
00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:54.905
Go Bantams!

72
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.491
Go!

73
00:08:57.616 --> 00:09:01.203
Go Bantams!

74
00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:04.331
We are the champs!
We are the champs!

75
00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:12.339
Tough as nails, hard as rocks!
We are Bannon's fighting cocks!

76
00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:14.508
How long can they keep this up?

77
00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:17.970
Forever. They have a fight song
with the word "cock" in it.

78
00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.598
Why aren't you sitting
with your honey?

79
00:09:20.723 --> 00:09:22.641
Bannon County's death machine!

80
00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:26.895
Someone should tell him he just
won the state championship.

81
00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:30.357
I have a feeling
he didn't get to play enough.

82
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:33.319
Well, shouldn't you be
sitting with him?

83
00:09:33.402 --> 00:09:36.697
After a game, he says
he needs to be with the guys.

84
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.033
You'd kill
his post-game bus high.

85
00:09:39.158 --> 00:09:43.245
Basically. If they lose,
it's a totally different thing.

86
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.830
Can't pry him off me.

87
00:10:00.512 --> 00:10:02.723
Shit.

88
00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:08.103
OK, everybody sit down.
Sit tight.

89
00:10:10.564 --> 00:10:12.608
Son of a bitch!

90
00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:32.252
What in the hell
would you call that?

91
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:38.759
I don't know,
but whatever it is...

92
00:10:38.884 --> 00:10:40.594
it's sharp as a son of a bitch.

93
00:10:49.103 --> 00:10:52.314
What in the hell
are we looking at?

94
00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:54.900
Sharp enough to flatten a tire,
whatever it is.

95
00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:56.485
You know how thick
that rubber is?

96
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.113
Have to be shot into it
like a bullet.

97
00:10:59.238 --> 00:11:01.782
Jesus Christ! The damn thing
has got teeth in it!

98
00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:04.743
They can't just whip the jack
out and pump this mother up?

99
00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:06.995
The driver can't change a flat
on a bus.

100
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:09.081
-They need a mechanic.
-So?

101
00:11:09.164 --> 00:11:13.127
So, do you see
any mechanics around here?

102
00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:14.670
You sucked so bad today,
Deaundre...

103
00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:17.256
they're probably saying
you gotta change the flat.

104
00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:21.927
...where she'll
give us the latest update...

105
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.929
-lzzy!
-on a continuing story...

106
00:11:24.012 --> 00:11:26.890
we call
"The Horror in Poho County."

107
00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:28.851
Hey, Poho update!

108
00:11:28.976 --> 00:11:30.477
Well, Peter,
the fire which gutted...

109
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:33.105
an old church south
of Pertwilla four days ago...

110
00:11:33.188 --> 00:11:35.816
continues to offer up
a gruesome bounty.

111
00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.360
County sheriffs
excavating the charred ruins...

112
00:11:38.443 --> 00:11:41.864
say the body count is now up
well past three hundred.

113
00:11:41.947 --> 00:11:44.449
County coroners
say the bodies were found...

114
00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:45.742
stitched to each other...

115
00:11:45.868 --> 00:11:48.495
covering the basement's
walls and ceiling.

116
00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:50.664
One on-the-scene witness
called it...

117
00:11:50.747 --> 00:11:53.959
"a human tapestry
of torture and sadism"...

118
00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:56.753
and "a sight
he will never forget."

119
00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.547
Sheila,
the details keep getting...

120
00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:01.049
stranger and stranger
every day this week, it seems.

121
00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.217
Any new information?

122
00:12:02.342 --> 00:12:04.011
Some of the corpses
they have found...

123
00:12:04.136 --> 00:12:06.346
had false teeth
made out of wood.

124
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.765
That means some of the bodies
they're finding down there...

125
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.018
are over two hundred years old.

126
00:12:11.143 --> 00:12:13.437
But, Peter, it's
the condition of the cadavers...

127
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:15.647
that's
the strangest fact of all.

128
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.150
The county coroner's office
reported yesterday...

129
00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:21.320
that they have yet to find
any one complete body.

130
00:12:21.403 --> 00:12:23.822
-Believe that, man?
-No, they're making it up.

131
00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:25.949
...missing an external limb
or an internal organ.

132
00:12:26.074 --> 00:12:27.451
What connection this has--

133
00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:31.872
This is 226, out on east 9.

134
00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:34.750
We are down and disabled.
Home base, do you read me?

135
00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.377
You get a good look
at the points on this thing?

136
00:12:37.502 --> 00:12:41.423
It's either ivory
or some kind of bone.

137
00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:45.052
Throw that damn thing away
before you need a tetanus shot.

138
00:12:45.177 --> 00:12:48.597
This is Betty Gorman out on 226.

139
00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:56.063
We are down and disabled
out on east 9.

140
00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:48.365
Pop!

141
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.784
Pop, it dropped something!

142
00:13:55.372 --> 00:13:57.165
Pop?

143
00:13:59.334 --> 00:14:02.796
It was out in the corn, papa.

144
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:04.381
Here, look at it.

145
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.839
We are out on east 9. We are
down and disabled. Come back.

146
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:31.843
-What about Kimball, man?
-Say again.

147
00:15:31.927 --> 00:15:34.554
This is 226. Anyone read me?

148
00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:38.183
We are down and disabled
out on east 9. Come back.

149
00:15:43.438 --> 00:15:46.066
We gotta be in some kind of
sun spot or something.

150
00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:47.651
There's no signal getting out.

151
00:15:47.776 --> 00:15:50.070
It's going to be dark
in about an hour.

152
00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:52.489
Well, we still got five tires
on the ground which means...

153
00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:55.492
we can probably limp home
if we keep the going slow.

154
00:15:57.911 --> 00:16:01.831
Say again, this is 226.
Anyone read me?

155
00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:04.292
All of you at the same time?

156
00:16:05.502 --> 00:16:08.129
Lady cheerleaders!

157
00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:11.424
That's not smoke I smell,
is it?

158
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.427
Minxie...

159
00:16:14.552 --> 00:16:16.596
there's not a girl
in the world these days...

160
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:18.640
stupid enough
to kill themselves...

161
00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:21.976
by sucking on cancer sticks,
am I right?

162
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.027
Back on the bus, ladies.

163
00:16:40.495 --> 00:16:41.871
You saw me, right?

164
00:16:41.996 --> 00:16:45.041
Run that fast break? Huh?
You see that?

165
00:16:45.166 --> 00:16:47.877
-Yeah, I saw it.
-Anybody gonna read about it?

166
00:16:49.921 --> 00:16:52.549
Why do you give ol' Dante
back there so much ink, huh?

167
00:16:55.176 --> 00:16:56.511
I'm serious.

168
00:16:56.636 --> 00:16:59.222
People are starting to think
that you're sweet on him.

169
00:16:59.347 --> 00:17:01.224
Really? I heard that was you.

170
00:17:01.349 --> 00:17:02.976
Hey, it's OK if you are, man.

171
00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:05.145
I mean,
live and let love, right?

172
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.689
Why don't you piss
on somebody else's shoes, Jake?

173
00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:09.399
Shouldn't you be
folding towels somewhere...

174
00:17:09.524 --> 00:17:10.567
or sniffing jockstraps?

175
00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:12.986
You think you can manage
the team, super genius?

176
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:15.447
Was I even talking to you,
jockstrap boy?

177
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.241
Hey, eat shit, Jake! God!

178
00:17:18.366 --> 00:17:21.119
So this is all because, what,
I don't write enough about you?

179
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.873
You know what the story is
on your scars there, right?

180
00:17:24.998 --> 00:17:26.040
No, tell me.

181
00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:28.626
Got into a fight
when you snuck into a bar.

182
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.712
So?

183
00:17:30.837 --> 00:17:32.255
A gay bar, bro.

184
00:17:34.883 --> 00:17:38.011
You do know what they call you,
don't you, lzzy?

185
00:17:38.094 --> 00:17:39.679
That's my name.

186
00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:42.640
"Or isn't he?"

187
00:17:46.144 --> 00:17:47.729
Hey, let's not make this...

188
00:17:47.854 --> 00:17:50.440
a social event out there,
everybody.

189
00:17:50.565 --> 00:17:53.693
Back on the bus, gentlemen.
We're moving!

190
00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:55.945
Big K,
does that come in a man size?

191
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.531
That means you, too, Kimball!
Let's go!

192
00:18:39.197 --> 00:18:42.700
Smooth move, Big K! Nice, man!

193
00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:46.204
Tippi Hedren, man!

194
00:18:46.287 --> 00:18:48.414
Kimball!
Stop clowning around...

195
00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:50.124
and get your ass
back on the bus!

196
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:54.545
Off the top, gentlemen.

197
00:18:54.629 --> 00:18:57.048
Assholes and elbows. Let's go.

198
00:20:06.701 --> 00:20:08.453
Damn!

199
00:20:54.707 --> 00:20:56.667
You know,
you could talk about it.

200
00:20:56.751 --> 00:20:59.503
It might help a little bit.

201
00:20:59.587 --> 00:21:03.216
What did I play today,
twelve minutes?

202
00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:06.510
Well, it was
a great twelve minutes.

203
00:21:06.594 --> 00:21:09.388
Hanna's got it in for me--

204
00:21:09.513 --> 00:21:12.391
him and his little
token white boy Barnes.

205
00:21:14.644 --> 00:21:16.729
I don't know...

206
00:21:16.854 --> 00:21:19.941
maybe I got the wrong skin color
to get equal play on this team.

207
00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:24.195
I know you don't mean that.

208
00:21:25.947 --> 00:21:27.448
Maybe they just wanted
to make sure...

209
00:21:27.573 --> 00:21:29.033
everyone got a chance to play
in the championship.

210
00:21:29.158 --> 00:21:32.119
Everyone's not the reason why
we made it to the championship.

211
00:21:32.245 --> 00:21:33.913
Half the losers on this bus
had nothing to do with...

212
00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:35.748
us making it to state--I did.

213
00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:40.586
What the fuck
are you looking at?

214
00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:49.173
Oh, Jesus Christ!

215
00:24:11.862 --> 00:24:13.781
Aw, don'ttell me.

216
00:24:13.906 --> 00:24:16.408
-We blew the other one.
-How?

217
00:24:16.534 --> 00:24:18.911
Back down, everybody. Sit tight.

218
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:21.372
Shit. We better
break out the flares...

219
00:24:21.455 --> 00:24:24.208
and get these kids off the bus.

220
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.252
Hey, hey, hey!

221
00:24:26.335 --> 00:24:28.212
You want to sit in here
and hope somebody doesn't...

222
00:24:28.295 --> 00:24:31.840
come along, plowing into us
doing ninety, huh?

223
00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:34.260
All right, Duane...

224
00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.595
you clear the bus,
I'll set the flares.

225
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:40.057
What is that, a flare gun?

226
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.103
You plan on being lost at sea
in this thing?

227
00:24:44.186 --> 00:24:45.646
You making fun of my lockbox?

228
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:46.814
'Cause everything
in this thing...

229
00:24:46.939 --> 00:24:49.108
has saved my sweet ass
at least once.

230
00:24:50.818 --> 00:24:52.987
Oh, I don't believe it.

231
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.325
All right, bring your coats
and stay in a group.

232
00:25:04.373 --> 00:25:07.668
This is Betty Borman,
out on 226.

233
00:25:07.793 --> 00:25:08.961
We're broke down on east 9...

234
00:25:09.086 --> 00:25:10.587
middle of Kissel County.
Anyone read me?

235
00:25:10.671 --> 00:25:12.965
Want me to help you push it
off the road before I go?

236
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.468
I don't think we can move it.
It's on a bare rim in the back.

237
00:25:16.593 --> 00:25:19.596
If you'd let the highway patrol
know, we'd appreciate it.

238
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.015
Sure.

239
00:25:35.195 --> 00:25:36.530
Come on, guys.

240
00:25:36.655 --> 00:25:38.615
Come on, let's go. Off the road.

241
00:25:41.994 --> 00:25:43.120
Come on, guys.

242
00:25:44.413 --> 00:25:47.374
Everyone on the shoulder.
Everyone stays in a group.

243
00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:50.502
Over by the side of the fence.

244
00:25:53.881 --> 00:25:55.883
Scott, come on!

245
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.810
Everyone stays back
and off the road! Now!

246
00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:11.732
Stuck in the side
of the tire again.

247
00:26:16.403 --> 00:26:19.698
Oh, God. Don't tell me...

248
00:26:19.823 --> 00:26:22.075
that's a belly button
in the middle of that thing.

249
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:26.038
Minxie, stay off the road.

250
00:26:27.122 --> 00:26:29.833
Everybody, off the road!

251
00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:32.461
Get everyone back on the bus.

252
00:26:32.586 --> 00:26:34.630
-You just said they shouldn't--
-I know what I just said...

253
00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:38.801
but there's something going on
out here, and I don't like it.

254
00:26:38.926 --> 00:26:40.761
I think if we just st--

255
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:08.997
Coach?

256
00:27:14.169 --> 00:27:15.546
What the f...

257
00:27:20.592 --> 00:27:22.678
Where the hell's the coach?

258
00:27:22.803 --> 00:27:24.930
Charlie?

259
00:27:32.062 --> 00:27:33.730
Charlie!

260
00:27:42.489 --> 00:27:46.118
Get everyone back inside
and close the doors.

261
00:27:46.243 --> 00:27:48.829
OK, champions,
getting back on the Betty Boop.

262
00:27:48.954 --> 00:27:51.331
Bucky, get on the two-way,
see if you can raise anyone.

263
00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:53.375
-I'm talking to you, Scotty!
-What happened to the coach?

264
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.837
Get everyone back onboard
and close those doors.

265
00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.425
Do it, Scotty.

266
00:28:05.846 --> 00:28:07.973
All right, you heard him.

267
00:28:08.098 --> 00:28:11.268
Assholes and elbows.
Everybody back on the bus.

268
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.563
Charlie?

269
00:28:16.481 --> 00:28:18.442
Charlie?

270
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.032
Hurry up!
On the bus! Now, now, now!

271
00:28:25.157 --> 00:28:27.034
I repeat, bus number 226...

272
00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:28.744
Charlie!

273
00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:30.704
We have an emergency situation
out here.

274
00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:31.997
Does anybody read me?

275
00:28:35.042 --> 00:28:38.795
This is bus number 226.
We are broke down on east 9.

276
00:29:17.793 --> 00:29:18.919
Jake...

277
00:29:26.635 --> 00:29:27.761
What happened?

278
00:29:28.804 --> 00:29:31.306
-What did you see?
-What did you see?

279
00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:33.642
Come on!
Did you see something or not?

280
00:29:36.436 --> 00:29:38.230
She flew away.

281
00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:43.360
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

282
00:29:43.443 --> 00:29:45.445
-What I just said!
-People don't fly away!

283
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:46.655
Sit down, Scott!

284
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.989
What the hell's going on
out there?

285
00:29:48.114 --> 00:29:51.243
I said sit the fuck down
and shut up, god damn it! Now!

286
00:29:54.955 --> 00:29:58.416
You, too, Jake. Everybody.

287
00:30:08.468 --> 00:30:11.304
Go sit down, Scott.

288
00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:13.890
-You got a problem with me?
-No. You got one with me?

289
00:30:13.974 --> 00:30:16.101
-Do I what?
-You heard me.

290
00:30:16.226 --> 00:30:19.646
We don't have time for bullshit,
Scotty. Go sit down!

291
00:30:19.771 --> 00:30:21.648
Oh, God!

292
00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:26.069
What the hell?

293
00:30:35.954 --> 00:30:37.914
Scotty!

294
00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.293
What the fuck?

295
00:30:49.342 --> 00:30:51.469
Get the fucking doors!
Get the fucking doors!

296
00:30:51.553 --> 00:30:53.638
Get the fucking doors!

297
00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:32.552
What was it?

298
00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:37.849
Scotty, what the fuck was it?

299
00:31:39.684 --> 00:31:41.144
-Scotty, come on!
-Scotty, we just want to know.

300
00:31:41.227 --> 00:31:43.229
I don't know what it was,
all right?

301
00:31:57.535 --> 00:31:59.079
It had wings--

302
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.707
big fucking wings.

303
00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:29.567
Central, this is unit 17.

304
00:32:29.692 --> 00:32:31.736
We did a drive-by
in the general area.

305
00:32:31.861 --> 00:32:35.657
Also found no evidence
of forced entry. Over.

306
00:32:35.782 --> 00:32:38.118
0-3-2,
we're 10-7 at Opper's Diner...

307
00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:41.746
for a little coffee and pie.
Copy that, central?

308
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:44.958
This is central.
Copy that, 0-3-6.

309
00:32:47.752 --> 00:32:50.171
All units,
anybody else getting...

310
00:32:50.296 --> 00:32:52.799
some weird stuff
out Kissel County way?

311
00:32:52.924 --> 00:32:54.634
I just got two calls,
ten miles apart...

312
00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:56.719
both reporting abductions.

313
00:32:56.803 --> 00:32:59.097
All units,
be informed this should be...

314
00:32:59.222 --> 00:33:02.517
strictly 10-36 information.

315
00:33:02.642 --> 00:33:05.311
Someone burning a marijuana
field out there tonight?

316
00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:08.147
'Cause these two stories
are way, way out.

317
00:33:08.273 --> 00:33:10.066
Roger that, 3-6. Come back.

318
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:12.235
Jacky! Kissel County!

319
00:33:12.318 --> 00:33:13.945
If you ask me,
this is Poho related.

320
00:33:14.028 --> 00:33:15.446
Repeat--Poho related.

321
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.282
You all know
what I'm talking about.

322
00:33:18.992 --> 00:33:22.036
This is Andy Buck.
Can anybody hear me?

323
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:24.497
Nobody's phone works.
Nobody's fucking phone works.

324
00:33:24.622 --> 00:33:27.417
We are stuck
in a broken-down school bus...

325
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.670
out on east 9,
and we are in serious trouble.

326
00:33:30.795 --> 00:33:32.755
Do you read me?

327
00:33:35.341 --> 00:33:39.095
Fuck! Come on!
Is anybody even out there?

328
00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:40.263
This is Andy Buck!

329
00:33:40.346 --> 00:33:45.643
We're stuck in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9!

330
00:33:45.727 --> 00:33:46.853
Javelins?

331
00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:50.106
We've got spears on this bus?

332
00:33:50.189 --> 00:33:51.608
Sticks.

333
00:33:51.691 --> 00:33:53.151
You want to wait around...

334
00:33:53.234 --> 00:33:54.902
so you can poke at that thing
with sticks?

335
00:33:55.028 --> 00:33:56.154
That thing
shows up here again...

336
00:33:56.237 --> 00:33:58.573
I'd rather have a sharp stick
in my hand than nothing at all.

337
00:33:58.698 --> 00:34:02.035
Hey, guys! Betty's flare gun.

338
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.828
Abunch offlaresforit,too!

339
00:34:03.953 --> 00:34:07.081
Who says we wait around?
I'm serious.

340
00:34:07.206 --> 00:34:10.752
Scotty, you're not talking
about getting off this bus.

341
00:34:10.877 --> 00:34:12.754
You see that?

342
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.674
That means
that there's a farm...

343
00:34:16.758 --> 00:34:18.051
down at the end of this road
somewhere...

344
00:34:18.176 --> 00:34:20.428
and that's as far as
anybody'd have to get to.

345
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:26.142
With that thing out there?

346
00:34:28.061 --> 00:34:30.897
Scotty,
with that thing out there?

347
00:34:32.732 --> 00:34:33.858
Scotty!

348
00:34:33.983 --> 00:34:35.610
That thing hasn't been
back here in almost an hour.

349
00:34:35.735 --> 00:34:37.862
That doesn't mean it's not
still up there somewhere.

350
00:34:37.987 --> 00:34:39.155
And that doesn't mean
that it is.

351
00:34:39.238 --> 00:34:41.407
Hey, this isn't about
who can run the fastest, OK?

352
00:34:41.532 --> 00:34:43.743
-Or being a pussy.
-What is your problem?

353
00:34:43.868 --> 00:34:45.787
-You tell me, lzzy or isn't he?
-Check yourselves, both of you!

354
00:34:45.912 --> 00:34:46.954
Do I make you nervous?

355
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.206
Thinking you're going
to come onto me...

356
00:34:48.289 --> 00:34:50.375
and every other swinging dick
on this bus makes me nervous.

357
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.335
Yeah, it makes you
fucking stupid, too!

358
00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:55.755
Scotty, stop it!

359
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.216
Stop it!

360
00:34:58.341 --> 00:34:59.717
Scotty, come on.

361
00:35:04.555 --> 00:35:06.224
You get that hand off of me...

362
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:07.892
or we're gonna have one more
missing person out here.

363
00:35:08.017 --> 00:35:09.852
There's nothing about
any of us on this bus...

364
00:35:09.936 --> 00:35:11.687
that's more important
than sticking together.

365
00:35:11.771 --> 00:35:14.273
It's the only way
we're going to get through this.

366
00:35:14.399 --> 00:35:17.068
You want to play
cock of the walk now, huh?

367
00:35:17.193 --> 00:35:20.571
Now's not the time
for this shit, Scotty.

368
00:35:20.655 --> 00:35:22.031
-Big K, sit.
-I'm serious.

369
00:35:22.115 --> 00:35:25.243
You want to play
cock of the walk, bro?

370
00:35:29.205 --> 00:35:31.082
Why do I think you want
to call me something else?

371
00:35:33.584 --> 00:35:36.754
You want to call me
something else, Scotty?

372
00:35:36.838 --> 00:35:38.047
'Cause I don't think you get...

373
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:40.883
I can see you thinking it
whether you say it or not.

374
00:35:42.593 --> 00:35:44.679
Just stop it right now.
Both of you, stop it!

375
00:35:44.804 --> 00:35:49.016
You guys all worked together
today to win a ball game.

376
00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:51.269
Now that something
really serious happens...

377
00:35:51.352 --> 00:35:54.272
you can't even be civil
to each other?

378
00:35:54.355 --> 00:35:55.606
You tell him, not me.

379
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.651
Whatever your trip is,
we ain't got time for this shit.

380
00:35:58.776 --> 00:35:59.819
We should all be
looking for ways...

381
00:35:59.944 --> 00:36:02.280
we can defend ourselves
until help gets here.

382
00:37:09.513 --> 00:37:11.515
We have got to move
this piece of shit!

383
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:12.683
On what, the rim?

384
00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:13.851
Can you drive this thing or not?

385
00:37:13.976 --> 00:37:16.479
We wouldn't get two feet, man!
What do you want me to do?

386
00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:32.578
What the hell does it want?

387
00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:40.836
What the fuck?
Is it looking at me?

388
00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:51.681
Whatever it is,
it's a smell freak, man.

389
00:38:07.029 --> 00:38:08.322
Get that light off him.

390
00:39:13.846 --> 00:39:16.265
Hey, don't shoot
that thing in here, man!

391
00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:18.893
He's right. It'll fill this
place up like a smokebomb.

392
00:39:20.603 --> 00:39:22.021
Holy shit!

393
00:39:22.146 --> 00:39:24.565
Did that just come off the door?

394
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.818
Bucky, get on those front doors
and get ready to open them.

395
00:39:27.943 --> 00:39:29.653
What, you think
we're gonna run outside?

396
00:39:29.737 --> 00:39:31.572
If he fucking comes inside.

397
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.159
Oh, shit!

398
00:39:35.284 --> 00:39:36.535
Oh, my God!

399
00:39:53.677 --> 00:39:55.387
Minxie?

400
00:39:57.723 --> 00:39:59.558
Minxie?

401
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.523
Is she OK?

402
00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:09.860
Minxie. Minxie.

403
00:40:09.985 --> 00:40:11.195
Minxie?

404
00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:21.538
Minxie?

405
00:41:11.797 --> 00:41:15.092
He eats everything.

406
00:41:15.175 --> 00:41:17.720
-He knows no mercy.
-No one is safe.

407
00:41:31.316 --> 00:41:34.987
Every 23rd spring,
for 23 days, it gets to eat.

408
00:41:39.408 --> 00:41:40.909
Eat what?

409
00:41:45.122 --> 00:41:47.416
Eat what?

410
00:41:49.418 --> 00:41:50.627
Eat us.

411
00:42:04.057 --> 00:42:05.684
Minx?

412
00:42:08.353 --> 00:42:10.939
Are you OK?

413
00:42:11.023 --> 00:42:13.150
Look at me.

414
00:42:13.275 --> 00:42:17.112
I thought you were gone, girl.
You passed out. Look at me.

415
00:42:17.196 --> 00:42:18.989
Are you OK?

416
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.493
Your eyes went all the way
in the back of your head.

417
00:42:22.576 --> 00:42:25.704
I think he's gone, man.
I'm willing to bet money on it.

418
00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:28.248
You willing to bet
stepping off this bus?

419
00:42:28.373 --> 00:42:30.501
Because that's the real bet.

420
00:42:30.584 --> 00:42:32.836
How long's it been?

421
00:42:34.004 --> 00:42:36.173
It's gone. It came,
it did its thing, it went away.

422
00:42:36.256 --> 00:42:37.883
It went away,
but what the hell was it doing?

423
00:42:38.008 --> 00:42:39.801
What do you think it was doing?

424
00:42:46.058 --> 00:42:48.352
It was picking people out.

425
00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:54.816
What?

426
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.321
It can smell something
in people, in their fear--

427
00:42:59.404 --> 00:43:01.907
something that helps it
pick people out.

428
00:43:03.116 --> 00:43:05.327
Pick people out for what?

429
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.205
I don't understand how
you would know that, sweetie.

430
00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:13.168
A dead boy told me.

431
00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:20.717
I think
he was trying to warn me.

432
00:43:20.842 --> 00:43:23.220
He was trying to warn
all of us...

433
00:43:23.303 --> 00:43:26.974
that this thing has been around
for thousands of years...

434
00:43:27.099 --> 00:43:28.642
and that nothing
has been able to kill it.

435
00:43:28.767 --> 00:43:30.352
This is a dream you had?

436
00:43:30.435 --> 00:43:31.520
Well, the boy was dead,
so, yes...

437
00:43:31.603 --> 00:43:33.105
I am assuming
that it was a dream, Scotty.

438
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.065
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

439
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.358
Now all of a sudden
you're a psychic hotline?

440
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:37.526
I don't know!

441
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:40.737
You want to explain it to me?
Because I can't.

442
00:43:47.285 --> 00:43:49.413
The boy was trying to warn us...

443
00:43:49.538 --> 00:43:52.624
that by morning it has
to go back into the earth.

444
00:43:52.749 --> 00:43:54.459
Oh, come on.

445
00:43:54.584 --> 00:43:57.754
Into the ground
for twenty-three more years.

446
00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:04.011
And then what?
Lives happily ever after? Huh?

447
00:44:04.136 --> 00:44:06.138
Why don't you clean out
your bong, all right?

448
00:44:06.263 --> 00:44:07.681
Scotty, just listen to her.

449
00:44:07.806 --> 00:44:08.890
It is coming back.

450
00:44:08.974 --> 00:44:11.393
This is a dream she had, Rhonda.
Are you going to believe it?

451
00:44:11.476 --> 00:44:13.603
And it doesn't matter
if we're hiding on this bus...

452
00:44:13.687 --> 00:44:16.189
or if we're hiding
under our beds.

453
00:44:16.314 --> 00:44:18.191
It'll find us--

454
00:44:19.568 --> 00:44:21.695
the ones that it picked out.

455
00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:40.714
Minx, take it easy, OK?

456
00:44:45.343 --> 00:44:47.929
The boy told me that...

457
00:44:48.013 --> 00:44:52.726
it can smell in our fear
who it wants...

458
00:44:54.853 --> 00:44:57.564
and what from them...

459
00:44:57.689 --> 00:44:58.815
it wants to eat.

460
00:45:13.288 --> 00:45:15.248
Hello. Is anyone out there?

461
00:45:16.541 --> 00:45:19.085
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

462
00:45:19.211 --> 00:45:21.796
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

463
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.592
Is anybody out there, please?

464
00:45:25.717 --> 00:45:27.928
We have a--
This is Andy Buck.

465
00:45:28.053 --> 00:45:29.513
We have a serious situation
out here.

466
00:45:29.638 --> 00:45:31.556
Is anybody out there?

467
00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:28.280
Does anybody hear me?

468
00:46:41.793 --> 00:46:43.211
Dad!

469
00:46:45.547 --> 00:46:48.341
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

470
00:46:48.466 --> 00:46:51.928
-226, are you still there?
-I'm so fucking still here.

471
00:46:52.053 --> 00:46:54.556
OK, OK. Just say again
what you just told me.

472
00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:56.141
We're not playing games here,
right?

473
00:46:56.266 --> 00:46:57.434
Just say it, man.

474
00:46:57.559 --> 00:47:02.814
We are trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on east 9...

475
00:47:02.939 --> 00:47:04.691
and something
is going to kill us...

476
00:47:04.816 --> 00:47:06.651
if we don't get help
out here right away.

477
00:47:06.776 --> 00:47:08.945
Where on 9 east?

478
00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:10.905
In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?

479
00:47:10.989 --> 00:47:13.992
What's trying to kill you?
What are you talking about?

480
00:47:14.075 --> 00:47:16.286
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

481
00:47:16.411 --> 00:47:20.165
Look, now listen to me.
I'm already on the 9...

482
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.417
but it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

483
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.586
Are there any landmarks
near you?

484
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:26.004
Are you close to anything?

485
00:47:26.129 --> 00:47:28.465
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
in my fucking pants, man.

486
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.759
Can you just please tell me
that you're on the way?

487
00:47:32.093 --> 00:47:34.512
I can't really judge
the strength of your signal...

488
00:47:34.637 --> 00:47:36.806
but it doesn't sound close.

489
00:47:36.931 --> 00:47:38.391
What does that mean, man?

490
00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:40.894
It means it's going to take me
a while to get to you.

491
00:47:41.019 --> 00:47:44.147
Look, we kind of have
a time-critical situation here.

492
00:47:44.272 --> 00:47:46.399
Roger that.

493
00:47:46.524 --> 00:47:48.443
And please tell me that
you're coming with backup...

494
00:47:48.526 --> 00:47:50.195
because
if you're not the cops...

495
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.280
you got to promise me
that you'll call them...

496
00:47:52.405 --> 00:47:55.450
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

497
00:47:55.533 --> 00:47:59.120
I'll call them.
I'll call them right now...

498
00:47:59.204 --> 00:48:00.997
but what you've got to do
is hang on.

499
00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.125
Can you do that? Hang on.

500
00:48:15.053 --> 00:48:16.679
Keep headed east.

501
00:48:21.392 --> 00:48:23.144
Dad?

502
00:48:23.228 --> 00:48:25.188
Just get us out there.

503
00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:29.692
Do it.

504
00:48:48.628 --> 00:48:50.213
Yes!

505
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:04.686
It's fucking happening, man!
It's fucking happening!

506
00:49:04.769 --> 00:49:06.229
We're being fucking rescued!

507
00:49:09.399 --> 00:49:12.110
Help me! Get this thing off me!

508
00:49:18.533 --> 00:49:20.702
Help! Help! Get this thing off!

509
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:25.498
Help me! Get this thing off me!

510
00:49:25.623 --> 00:49:27.000
Look out!

511
00:51:24.075 --> 00:51:26.536
Half its fuckin' head's gone.

512
00:51:41.926 --> 00:51:43.052
Fuck.

513
00:53:12.767 --> 00:53:16.062
-You gotta be...
-Fucking kiddin' me.

514
00:54:04.568 --> 00:54:06.529
Get that door open.
Now's our chance.

515
00:54:09.657 --> 00:54:10.908
It's dead, right?

516
00:54:11.033 --> 00:54:12.701
Don't know. Don't care.

517
00:54:12.827 --> 00:54:14.328
It won't open!

518
00:54:21.418 --> 00:54:23.879
Stop pushin' on 'em!
They open in!

519
00:54:25.673 --> 00:54:27.424
Something got screwed up!

520
00:54:28.968 --> 00:54:30.219
The door opens.

521
00:54:36.475 --> 00:54:38.644
Maybe it only opens
from the outside.

522
00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:40.020
It's an emergency exit, idiot.

523
00:54:40.104 --> 00:54:42.273
Then you fuckin' open it, man!

524
00:54:42.398 --> 00:54:44.233
Get that door open.

525
00:54:53.492 --> 00:54:58.289
How can both fuckin' exits
not fuckin' work?

526
00:54:58.414 --> 00:55:01.125
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

527
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.376
He jammed it.

528
00:55:04.837 --> 00:55:06.547
We thought
it was trying to come in...

529
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.215
but this frickin' thing
was making sure...

530
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.134
we couldn't get out.

531
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:20.895
Break the fuckin' doors!

532
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.602
Holy shit, man.

533
00:56:09.652 --> 00:56:10.819
Hey, we can
pry this thing open.

534
00:56:13.405 --> 00:56:16.909
Give me a pole or a bar or
something metal--something big.

535
00:56:17.034 --> 00:56:19.703
Yeah, yeah. That'll work.

536
00:56:31.382 --> 00:56:34.051
Come on, D.
You need to get to this side.

537
00:56:34.176 --> 00:56:35.844
Come on, everybody. Come on.

538
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:42.184
This thing's like
a fuckin' shower curtain, man.

539
00:56:42.267 --> 00:56:43.519
It's crazy.

540
00:56:47.815 --> 00:56:50.109
Oh, man,
show like you got a pair.

541
00:56:50.234 --> 00:56:52.611
Man, fuck you.

542
00:56:52.736 --> 00:56:54.530
Come on.

543
00:56:55.989 --> 00:56:57.616
Everybody, let's go.

544
00:57:08.919 --> 00:57:10.379
Shower curtain?

545
00:57:10.504 --> 00:57:12.381
This thing's like
a fucking piece of toilet paper.

546
00:58:34.338 --> 00:58:36.798
What's it doing, Minx?

547
00:58:36.882 --> 00:58:39.509
What's it doing, Minx?

548
00:58:39.635 --> 00:58:42.346
What's it doing up there?

549
00:59:14.628 --> 00:59:16.129
It just tore its head off.

550
01:00:39.588 --> 01:00:41.047
It's time to go.

551
01:00:44.426 --> 01:00:46.344
What are you talking about,
man? Help is coming.

552
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.848
The 9 is big. Remember?

553
01:00:51.474 --> 01:00:54.352
What if he's an hour away?

554
01:00:54.477 --> 01:00:56.396
What's if he's going
in the wrong direction?

555
01:00:56.479 --> 01:00:58.273
There are fucking cops
on the way, man.

556
01:00:58.398 --> 01:00:59.566
And you want the rest of us...

557
01:00:59.649 --> 01:01:01.109
to sit underneath
that big hole in the roof...

558
01:01:01.234 --> 01:01:03.904
and hope that thing
doesn't come crashing in here?

559
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.240
What do you mean,
the rest of us?

560
01:01:07.324 --> 01:01:09.451
I mean...

561
01:01:09.576 --> 01:01:12.621
it's time to stop being polite.

562
01:01:12.746 --> 01:01:16.416
There are two classes
of people on this bus now.

563
01:01:16.499 --> 01:01:19.502
It had its pick
of twenty of us back there...

564
01:01:19.628 --> 01:01:20.795
and it picked who?

565
01:01:20.921 --> 01:01:24.299
Dante was one.

566
01:01:25.675 --> 01:01:27.135
Another one was you, Jake.

567
01:01:27.219 --> 01:01:28.887
Oh, god damn it, Scott.
Don't--

568
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.806
And we all saw him
go for you, Bucky.

569
01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:34.935
What the hell
is that supposed to mean, huh?

570
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.020
Two classes of people?

571
01:01:37.145 --> 01:01:39.981
What, the "will be eaten"
and the "won't be eaten"?

572
01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:41.483
Fuck you, Scotty.

573
01:01:42.817 --> 01:01:44.277
Minxie says this thing...

574
01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:46.154
gets anybody it picks out,
no matter what.

575
01:01:46.279 --> 01:01:47.989
Don't put me in this.

576
01:01:48.114 --> 01:01:49.866
She also said
that after tonight...

577
01:01:49.991 --> 01:01:52.535
it goes away,
and for a long time, Scott.

578
01:01:52.661 --> 01:01:55.372
You tell us, Minxie.

579
01:01:55.497 --> 01:01:58.166
Are we safe if we can hide out
till morning...

580
01:01:58.249 --> 01:02:00.335
or is this thing
gonna come after these guys...

581
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.880
with everything it's got
'cause it only has till morning?

582
01:02:07.884 --> 01:02:09.135
Huh?

583
01:02:13.974 --> 01:02:15.350
We're screwed, right?

584
01:02:20.313 --> 01:02:22.315
Yeah.

585
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.275
Scotty, you're not talkin'...

586
01:02:24.401 --> 01:02:26.027
about throwing people
off this bus?

587
01:02:26.111 --> 01:02:27.737
It's funny
you should say that, D...

588
01:02:27.862 --> 01:02:28.905
'cause the only other one...

589
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:30.365
we know it picked out
for sure was you.

590
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:31.950
Whoa! Hold on a second!

591
01:02:32.033 --> 01:02:33.910
We all saw the way
it sniffed you out back there.

592
01:02:34.035 --> 01:02:36.162
You were the only one
it gave tongue action, man...

593
01:02:36.246 --> 01:02:38.415
-and we all saw it.
-Scotty!

594
01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.292
I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

595
01:02:41.418 --> 01:02:42.627
I'm trying to stay alive.

596
01:02:42.752 --> 01:02:44.129
You're trying to split us up!

597
01:02:44.212 --> 01:02:49.884
We have just dropped a notch
on the fucking food chain, man.

598
01:02:53.471 --> 01:02:58.727
This is about
living or dying now, OK?

599
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:01.896
And if this bus
is the only thing...

600
01:03:02.021 --> 01:03:03.398
keeping that fucker
away for us...

601
01:03:03.523 --> 01:03:05.900
how safe are we, you guys...

602
01:03:05.984 --> 01:03:09.738
with everybody it's hungry for
sittin' inside it?

603
01:03:13.241 --> 01:03:15.410
I want to see hands.

604
01:03:17.787 --> 01:03:20.415
I want to see hands...

605
01:03:20.498 --> 01:03:23.251
'cause as shitty a deal
as it is...

606
01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:30.258
I gotta say I'd like you, Bucky,
and Jake off this bus, man.

607
01:03:32.093 --> 01:03:35.555
You listen to me,
you piece of shit!

608
01:03:35.638 --> 01:03:40.101
He looked at you, too, bro.

609
01:03:40.226 --> 01:03:43.354
I saw him, and you did, too.

610
01:03:43.438 --> 01:03:47.817
He looked right at you
and smiled.

611
01:03:47.942 --> 01:03:50.487
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it...

612
01:03:50.612 --> 01:03:53.406
he could've looked at you twice
and licked his fucking lips...

613
01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:55.700
but we don't know that.

614
01:03:55.825 --> 01:03:59.037
So you keep
your little blacklist.

615
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.832
'Cause when he takes you out--
and I hope he does--

616
01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.669
I'm gonna be the one
gettin' as far away...

617
01:04:06.794 --> 01:04:09.422
from your sorry ass as I can.

618
01:04:14.636 --> 01:04:16.429
"Time to go" is right.

619
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:21.726
-I'm gonna go find that farm.
-Then I'm going with you.

620
01:04:21.851 --> 01:04:23.436
You know I'm coming.

621
01:04:26.564 --> 01:04:29.150
You want to keep this bus?

622
01:04:29.275 --> 01:04:30.985
Then you sit in it.

623
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:34.155
Right under that big hole.

624
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.241
See how long you last.

625
01:04:38.868 --> 01:04:41.329
Look, I'm sorry, D.

626
01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:43.414
You are so right about that.

627
01:04:47.877 --> 01:04:49.254
Come on, guys.

628
01:04:50.755 --> 01:04:52.173
Come on, help is on the way.

629
01:04:52.257 --> 01:04:53.967
Why are we splitting up?

630
01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:55.385
He said he was coming.

631
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:57.595
We're gonna leave,
and he's gonna pull up.

632
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.807
That bus is a deathtrap, Bucky.
Use your head.

633
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.684
You're really gonna
let them go alone?

634
01:05:02.809 --> 01:05:04.143
What, do you want
to go with them?

635
01:05:04.227 --> 01:05:05.728
We don't know who it picked out.

636
01:05:05.853 --> 01:05:07.897
Jesus Christ,
it looked at everyone.

637
01:05:11.317 --> 01:05:13.236
Scotty, let go of me.

638
01:05:13.361 --> 01:05:16.322
-Let go of you?
-Let go of me!

639
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.503
Fuck.

640
01:05:34.757 --> 01:05:36.843
Rho...

641
01:05:36.926 --> 01:05:39.679
tell me you're really
walking away from me.

642
01:05:39.762 --> 01:05:41.723
You used me. You used all of us!

643
01:05:41.806 --> 01:05:43.725
All you care about is yourself.

644
01:05:43.808 --> 01:05:44.851
Rho...

645
01:05:44.976 --> 01:05:48.229
You want to know, Scotty,
what I found out today?

646
01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.814
When people get really scared...

647
01:05:49.939 --> 01:05:51.733
it's just like
when they get drunk.

648
01:05:51.816 --> 01:05:53.735
The real person
comes to the surface.

649
01:05:53.818 --> 01:05:56.154
We could've protected
D and Jake and all of us...

650
01:05:56.237 --> 01:05:57.572
if we'd stuck together!

651
01:05:57.655 --> 01:05:59.574
You know, like in a team.

652
01:05:59.657 --> 01:06:01.701
Hey. Hey!

653
01:06:10.752 --> 01:06:11.919
Jonny!

654
01:06:13.713 --> 01:06:16.883
-Open the door!
-Open the door!

655
01:06:16.966 --> 01:06:18.468
Open the door!

656
01:06:20.052 --> 01:06:22.013
You little cocksucker!
I will fucking fry you!

657
01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:25.183
You open these goddamn doors!
You open them right now!

658
01:06:25.266 --> 01:06:28.728
Jonny, open the fucking doors,
man! Open the--

659
01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:34.150
Open the--
This is my bus, too, man!

660
01:06:40.114 --> 01:06:41.449
Run!

661
01:07:15.775 --> 01:07:18.653
Run! He's right behind you, D!

662
01:07:18.778 --> 01:07:20.821
Run! Run!

663
01:07:26.827 --> 01:07:30.665
Get back! Get off! Break off!

664
01:07:42.301 --> 01:07:45.471
Oh, God!

665
01:08:00.987 --> 01:08:03.864
-Shit!
-Hold on, hold on!

666
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:05.908
Hold still!

667
01:08:07.576 --> 01:08:08.869
Stop moving! Stop!

668
01:08:08.995 --> 01:08:11.330
Come on, Scotty!

669
01:08:11.414 --> 01:08:14.000
You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

670
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:15.668
Get me--

671
01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:18.838
-Hold still! Pull it out!
-Hold on!

672
01:08:20.256 --> 01:08:22.967
Stop it! Keep back! Stop moving!

673
01:08:23.092 --> 01:08:25.386
It's in there like it's welded!

674
01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:28.556
Pull that out!
You're hurting him!

675
01:08:28.681 --> 01:08:30.057
Stop it, Scotty!

676
01:08:30.182 --> 01:08:32.560
-Hold still!
-Stop it, Scotty!

677
01:08:32.643 --> 01:08:34.186
Izzy, hold him! Hold him!

678
01:08:34.312 --> 01:08:36.230
Scotty, hold still!

679
01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:38.607
Scotty, hold still!

680
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.572
Get it!

681
01:08:44.655 --> 01:08:46.407
Please fuckin' hurry!

682
01:08:47.575 --> 01:08:49.368
Oh, God!

683
01:08:51.579 --> 01:08:53.039
Oh, shit! Please hurry!

684
01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:54.373
Oh, God! Please hurry!

685
01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.876
Oh, D, I'm sorry, man!
I'm so sorry!

686
01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:58.794
Please fuckin' help!

687
01:09:07.887 --> 01:09:10.014
Scotty! Scotty!

688
01:09:10.097 --> 01:09:12.433
Scotty! Scotty!

689
01:09:12.558 --> 01:09:15.061
Scotty! Scotty!

690
01:09:15.186 --> 01:09:19.774
Damn it! Scotty! Scotty!

691
01:09:46.467 --> 01:09:48.344
What is it, boy? What is it?

692
01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:59.063
Papa!

693
01:10:07.613 --> 01:10:09.573
Go. Go!

694
01:10:24.255 --> 01:10:26.006
Where did you come from?

695
01:10:28.259 --> 01:10:29.843
From that bus?

696
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:34.348
How far up ahead?

697
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.641
Huh?

698
01:10:37.393 --> 01:10:38.769
Come on, answer me.

699
01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.647
It doesn't matter.

700
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:47.194
There's no one on the bus,
and you can't kill it.

701
01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:54.118
Jacky, get the dog inside.

702
01:10:54.201 --> 01:10:55.661
Look, you can't stop it!

703
01:10:55.744 --> 01:10:57.913
You get in the cabin
with Jack Jr.

704
01:10:58.038 --> 01:10:59.873
You stay down till this is over.

705
01:10:59.999 --> 01:11:01.959
This'll never be over!

706
01:11:03.502 --> 01:11:05.504
It doesn't matter what you do.

707
01:11:08.299 --> 01:11:10.384
It'll be back...

708
01:11:10.509 --> 01:11:12.970
twenty-three years from now...

709
01:11:13.053 --> 01:11:15.598
and twenty-three years
from then.

710
01:11:19.727 --> 01:11:22.062
Get us to that bus.

711
01:11:35.909 --> 01:11:37.328
Jonny?

712
01:11:39.747 --> 01:11:40.914
Jonny?

713
01:11:50.591 --> 01:11:51.925
What was that?

714
01:11:57.139 --> 01:11:59.224
Jonny?

715
01:12:02.311 --> 01:12:04.271
Bucky!

716
01:12:04.355 --> 01:12:06.231
What are you doin' here?

717
01:12:06.315 --> 01:12:08.275
What are you doin' here?

718
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.488
You let her in, huh, Jonny?

719
01:12:16.867 --> 01:12:19.578
Have you seen anybody else?

720
01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:21.747
What are you doing?

721
01:12:21.872 --> 01:12:25.292
That thing is after you, Bucky.

722
01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.753
Hey, there's no farm
out there, man.

723
01:12:27.836 --> 01:12:30.631
I must--I must've run ten miles
all over this fuckin' valley.

724
01:12:30.756 --> 01:12:32.591
Bucky...

725
01:12:32.674 --> 01:12:36.345
come on, just please go away.

726
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:39.306
Don't make me
go back out there again, man.

727
01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:41.517
It's fuckin' freaky
out there, man. Please.

728
01:15:09.831 --> 01:15:11.166
Get around the bus!

729
01:15:22.302 --> 01:15:23.804
Jacky!

730
01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:26.431
Get us around this bus now!

731
01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:29.684
Now! Get around the bus!

732
01:16:11.685 --> 01:16:14.020
Jacky, get out!
Get out of there now!

733
01:16:26.158 --> 01:16:28.243
Jacky!

734
01:16:30.412 --> 01:16:31.997
You all right?

735
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.041
Jacky, answer me!

736
01:16:37.043 --> 01:16:39.546
Jacky, answer me!

737
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.006
Are you OK?

738
01:16:41.089 --> 01:16:43.049
I think so.

739
01:16:57.314 --> 01:17:01.568
Jacky, get us away
from the bus!

740
01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:05.196
Come on, let's go!
Get us away from the bus!

741
01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:10.201
Come on, Jacky, go on!
Get us away!

742
01:17:10.285 --> 01:17:11.453
Move it!

743
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.880
Dad?

744
01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:26.217
-Dad?
-Yeah!

745
01:17:36.061 --> 01:17:37.562
Dad!

746
01:17:52.285 --> 01:17:54.496
All you kids, get down!

747
01:19:09.487 --> 01:19:10.989
Jacky!

748
01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:12.824
Jacky!

749
01:19:12.907 --> 01:19:15.660
You gotta get us
away from the bus now!

750
01:19:21.374 --> 01:19:22.584
Come on!

751
01:19:41.561 --> 01:19:42.687
Dad!

752
01:19:47.025 --> 01:19:48.401
Dad, get out of there.

753
01:19:48.526 --> 01:19:50.987
The spool's jammed
in the cradle!

754
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:52.488
Dad, just get out!

755
01:19:52.572 --> 01:19:54.991
The cradle's welded
to the truck's frame.

756
01:19:55.074 --> 01:19:56.159
Get out, dad!

757
01:19:56.242 --> 01:19:58.745
He'll rip my gun
right out of the truck!

758
01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:00.538
Dad, just get the fuck
out of there!

759
01:20:29.984 --> 01:20:33.071
Dad, dad...

760
01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.448
are you OK?

761
01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:38.785
Dad!

762
01:20:44.165 --> 01:20:46.292
Dad?

763
01:20:47.585 --> 01:20:48.836
Dad!

764
01:21:03.476 --> 01:21:05.687
You're not going
to believe this...

765
01:21:05.812 --> 01:21:07.271
but I think
I found a way out of here.

766
01:21:12.151 --> 01:21:13.486
What?

767
01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.405
Minxie said it doesn't matter.

768
01:21:15.488 --> 01:21:17.323
It doesn't matter
what Minxie said.

769
01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:20.493
Right?

770
01:21:23.454 --> 01:21:25.915
The others might've gotten away.

771
01:21:25.998 --> 01:21:28.501
We don't know that.

772
01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.002
Kimball, too.

773
01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.884
Hey, nobody gets to decide
we die.

774
01:21:37.009 --> 01:21:39.804
No dream, nobody--
nobody gets to decide that!

775
01:21:39.887 --> 01:21:41.180
That is bullshit!

776
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.355
I hope so.

777
01:21:51.858 --> 01:21:54.902
Come on, I want to go show you
a big ugly bug.

778
01:22:00.366 --> 01:22:01.993
That's the truck
that passed us this morning--

779
01:22:02.076 --> 01:22:03.619
you remember,
with the big bug on top of it?

780
01:22:03.703 --> 01:22:05.037
You think we can just
drive away in it?

781
01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:06.956
No, but I think I know
how to hot-wire a truck.

782
01:22:07.039 --> 01:22:08.124
That's how I got
in my bar fight.

783
01:22:08.207 --> 01:22:09.792
I was trying to steal
somebody's truck.

784
01:22:09.876 --> 01:22:11.878
A gay bar?

785
01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:13.880
Jesus Christ.

786
01:22:18.718 --> 01:22:21.846
Wherever he was going,
I don't think he made it.

787
01:22:27.101 --> 01:22:30.271
Oh, my God.
The keys are in it.

788
01:22:30.396 --> 01:22:32.356
Come on, man,
the keys are in it.

789
01:22:36.694 --> 01:22:38.362
It's not birds.

790
01:22:38.446 --> 01:22:41.199
-Come on.
-Fuck!

791
01:22:41.282 --> 01:22:42.408
Shit!

792
01:22:44.452 --> 01:22:45.578
D!

793
01:22:46.621 --> 01:22:48.206
Go! Go, go!

794
01:22:48.289 --> 01:22:52.376
Go, go, go! Go, go!

795
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:53.628
Go, man, go!

796
01:23:04.055 --> 01:23:06.057
I'm a sitting duck
back here, lzzy! Step on it!

797
01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:07.934
I've got it floored!

798
01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.101
Go! Come on, go!

799
01:23:09.227 --> 01:23:11.437
-Go faster! Make it go faster!
-I can't!

800
01:23:14.941 --> 01:23:17.526
Go, go!

801
01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:18.945
Go, man! Go, go!

802
01:23:19.028 --> 01:23:21.197
Izzy, go!

803
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.117
Go! Izzy!
Move this piece of shit!

804
01:23:25.201 --> 01:23:28.704
Come on! Come on! Move it!

805
01:23:28.788 --> 01:23:31.832
Izzy! Go, go!

806
01:23:42.176 --> 01:23:44.345
Izzy, do something!

807
01:23:48.099 --> 01:23:49.392
Izzy!

808
01:23:49.475 --> 01:23:50.935
Get down!

809
01:23:54.355 --> 01:23:55.648
Izzy!

810
01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:58.317
Come on! Come on!

811
01:23:58.442 --> 01:24:00.736
Izzy!

812
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:03.322
Izzy, fucking do something!

813
01:24:04.949 --> 01:24:06.575
-Get out!
-What?

814
01:24:06.659 --> 01:24:09.787
Come on! Come on! Come on!

815
01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:12.665
-Get out!
-Are you fucking crazy?

816
01:24:13.791 --> 01:24:15.584
Izzy! Izzy!

817
01:24:15.668 --> 01:24:18.504
-Come on! Izzy!
-Stay down!

818
01:24:20.214 --> 01:24:21.882
Stay down!

819
01:32:34.165 --> 01:32:35.375
It isn't dead.

820
01:32:41.131 --> 01:32:43.300
Its time ran out.

821
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:03.320
It looks dead to me.

822
01:34:28.321 --> 01:34:29.656
You Taggart?

823
01:34:29.781 --> 01:34:30.824
That's right.

824
01:34:33.201 --> 01:34:34.536
Can we see it?

825
01:34:34.619 --> 01:34:35.995
Can you read?

826
01:34:41.751 --> 01:34:43.503
This something real?

827
01:34:45.463 --> 01:34:48.716
Because I heard
it was a bunch of bullshit.

828
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.593
It's still five bucks.

829
01:34:53.638 --> 01:34:55.098
Where'd it come from?

830
01:34:57.475 --> 01:34:59.102
My dad killed it.

831
01:34:59.185 --> 01:35:00.937
Yeah, but where'd it come from?

832
01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:04.691
It's five bucks from you, too.

833
01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:08.695
How'd he kill it?

834
01:35:13.867 --> 01:35:15.285
Ask him.

835
01:35:50.903 --> 01:35:51.988
Come on, man.

836
01:35:52.071 --> 01:35:54.866
We ought to go get
our money back.

837
01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:58.703
What the hell is it?

838
01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:00.330
What do you think it is?

839
01:36:10.256 --> 01:36:13.051
We don't touch it.

840
01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:25.563
What's the story on this thing?

841
01:36:27.065 --> 01:36:29.734
Whatever you've heard, probably.

842
01:36:29.859 --> 01:36:33.196
You expect us to think
that that thing's real?

843
01:36:33.279 --> 01:36:34.739
Don't really care.

844
01:36:34.864 --> 01:36:36.699
How'd you kill it?

845
01:36:39.369 --> 01:36:43.623
Stabbed it
right through the heart...

846
01:36:43.748 --> 01:36:47.168
with a big homemade harpoon.

847
01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:56.886
When?

848
01:36:58.096 --> 01:37:00.765
About twenty-three years ago.

849
01:37:03.643 --> 01:37:06.104
You waiting for something?

850
01:37:09.816 --> 01:37:12.276
About three more days...

851
01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:18.282
give or take a day or two.
