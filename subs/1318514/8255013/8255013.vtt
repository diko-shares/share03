WEBVTT

3
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.938
Okay, okay. Here you go.

4
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.233
And let's go again.

5
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.820
<i>Which one is this?
Number nine?</i>

6
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.321
Yeah, this is number nine.

7
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.615
<i>Bright Eyes, we call her.</i>

8
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.410
Are you watching this?

9
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.372
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

10
00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.128
Oh, my God.

11
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.171
Oh, my God.

12
00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.261
<i>How many moves was that?</i>
20.

13
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:42.471
Yeah, a perfect score is 15.

14
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:43.931
Doc, what are
you giving her?

15
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.308
Hey, give me that video!

16
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.691
Chimp number nine,
just one dose.

17
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:55.026
Aren't I seeing you later?

18
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.319
We are good to go.

19
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.738
I'm going to call you back.
Yeah, all right. Thanks. Bye.

20
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.114
The 112. It works.

21
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.075
On just the one primate.

22
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.163
One is all we need.
Full cognitive recovery. We're ready.

23
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.083
Look, are you sure
you're not rushing this?

24
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.960
I've been working on this
for five and a half years.

25
00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.379
The data is clear.

26
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:16.797
We're ready, Steven.

27
00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:19.008
All I need is your
approval for human trials.

28
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.718
For this,
you're going to need the board's approval.

29
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.721
There's a lot of money
riding on this, Will.

30
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.056
You only get one shot.

31
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.016
One shot is all I need.

32
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.688
All right.
But I'll need to see

33
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.607
all the research.
You got it.

34
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.192
And, Will...
Yeah?

35
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.070
Keep your personal
emotions out of it.

36
00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.906
These people invest
in results, not dreams.

37
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.074
Okay.

38
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.036
Meet chimp nine.

39
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.873
Here she is tasking at what
is called the Lucas Tower,

40
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.460
the object of which is to move
the tower from peg to peg,

41
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:58.297
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.

42
00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:01.968
As expected,
she was unable to complete the puzzle at all.

43
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:06.263
Then, we gave her
what we call ALZ-112,

44
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.102
a gene therapy that allows the
brain to create its own cells

45
00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.728
in order to repair itself.

46
00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:17.483
In biology, this is called neurogenesis.
Here at Gen-Sys,

47
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.153
we call it
the cure to Alzheimer's.

48
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.492
Donnie, you get her ready?

49
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:27.910
She's got stage fright.

50
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.412
Is that what it is?

51
00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.460
Hey! Hey!

52
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.382
She is going to
break my hand!

53
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.384
Let go. Bright Eyes, let go!

54
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.181
Are you all right?

55
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.942
We're ready to move on to the next phase.
Human trials.

56
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.279
Here you go, Bright Eyes.

57
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.031
It's your favorite
fizzy soda, come on.

58
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.992
Let's go, Donnie.
We should have her downstairs already.

59
00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.244
Okay? Good girl.

60
00:06:12.164 --> 00:06:13.164
Come on out, girl.
That's right.

61
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.917
That's for you.

62
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.298
Around the neck, Donnie!
Around the neck.

63
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.632
Around the neck! Jesus!

64
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.054
Donnie, do it now!
Open up!

65
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.346
Donnie!

66
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.349
I'm going to sedate her.

67
00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.726
No, no, no, no!

68
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.436
Door! Get the door!
Bright Eyes!

69
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.774
No, no, no, no.

70
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.652
<i>Close it down.
Close it down now!</i>

71
00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.571
Go get help.
Donnie! Donnie! Come on.

72
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.991
There have been absolutely no
side effects associated with 112.

73
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.243
With one exception.

74
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:54.747
For some reason,
the chimps' irises exhibit flecks of green.

75
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.666
Actually, we first
noticed it in chimp nine.

76
00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.960
Hence her nickname,
Bright Eyes.

77
00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.545
You will see when
we bring her in.

78
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:08.427
Watch out!

79
00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:09.804
In theory,

80
00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.847
this therapy can
be used to treat

81
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.849
a wide range of
brain disorders.

82
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.898
It is virtually limitless.

83
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:24.568
As are the potential profits,
which is why

84
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:29.198
we are confident that you will
vote to approve human trials.

85
00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.039
No! No!

86
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.228
Mr. Jacobs? Mr. Jacobs,
I am begging you.

87
00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.855
I am begging you
not to do this.

88
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.481
Look, it would cost
a small fortune

89
00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:04.608
to run lab work-ups
on all of those chimps

90
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.110
only to tell me
what I already know.

91
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.279
That they are contaminated.

92
00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.530
There are lives
at stake here.

93
00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.075
These are animals with personalities,
with attachments.

94
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.911
Attachments?
Yeah.

95
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.165
I run a business,
not a petting zoo.

96
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.793
Find the most cost-effective
way to put those apes down.

97
00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:23.836
I can't do that.

98
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.213
You're the chimp handler.
Handle it.

99
00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.382
Steven?

100
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.301
Well, that was fun.

101
00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:31.677
They've taken the 112.

102
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.429
The board have
rejected your proposal.

103
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.264
They've chosen to
advance other programs.

104
00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.516
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

105
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:39.810
Yes, there is.
I could fire you.

106
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:41.604
Believe me,
we talked about it.

107
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.023
We have five years
of conclusive data.

108
00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.399
Parade all the data you want,

109
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.569
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.

110
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.031
This drug has
the potential to save lives.

111
00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.657
To bankrupt this company,
more like.

112
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:57.494
I swear, you know everything
about the human brain

113
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.038
except the way it works.

114
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.711
Go back to the drawing
board on the 112.

115
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.214
Start again in
molecular development.

116
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.050
Find a way to get there
before someone else does.

117
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.136
And clean up this mess.

118
00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.197
Franklin?

119
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.249
They carry small.

120
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.502
She must have been pregnant
when they brought her in.

121
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.795
So that's why...

122
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.298
She wasn't being aggressive,
she was just being protective?

123
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.925
She thought we were
going to hurt her baby.

124
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.427
Come here.

125
00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.641
I'd take him myself,
but my brother-in-law works for security.

126
00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:02.643
He'd rat me out in a second.

127
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.562
What, you want me
to take it home?

128
00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:06.730
I can't take care
of a monkey.

129
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.732
He's not a monkey,
he's an ape.

130
00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.025
Franklin, I...

131
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.362
It's just for a couple days,
until I find a sanctuary. That's all I need.

132
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.240
Franklin, no. Look,
this isn't my responsibility.

133
00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.117
This is company property.

134
00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:24.456
Okay. I'm going to
tell you what, Doc.

135
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:27.209
Jacobs made me put
down the other 12.

136
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.544
I'm done.

137
00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:32.923
Be my guest.

138
00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.741
Hey.
Hi.

139
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.535
Oh, you look beat.
Yeah.

140
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.287
How is he doing?

141
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.956
Well, he has good days
and bad days.

142
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.627
Today, not so good.
Although, he has been quoting Shakespeare.

143
00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.380
Oh, you got a pet.

144
00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.674
Just a temporary
house guest.

145
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.801
Oh. Well,
it might be good for him.

146
00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.928
Yeah.
Good night.

147
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.443
Hey, Dad.

148
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.366
Dad?
Will!

149
00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.202
Hi.
I didn't hear you come in.

150
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.122
Today is the day, right?

151
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.665
You thought I'd forget.

152
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.127
You have a big test today, right?
Chemistry?

153
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.133
Hey, Dad, do you
want to see something?

154
00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.510
What?

155
00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.313
What is that?
Is he injured?

156
00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:14.149
No, I think that
is a birthmark.

157
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.446
"But as for Caesar,

158
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.575
"kneel down, kneel down,
and wonder."

159
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.953
Yeah, don't get
too attached.

160
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.498
He is a cute
little guy, isn't he?

161
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:18.839
Where are my car keys?

162
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.509
My car keys!
Where did you put them?

163
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.136
Dad.

164
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.597
You don't drive anymore.

165
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.184
I know that.

166
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.022
Here,

167
00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.484
why don't you feed him?

168
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.569
Can you do that?
Of course I can.

169
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.747
Will, look at this.

170
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.962
How old is he?
A day old? Two days old?

171
00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.089
Yeah.

172
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.343
Well, he is a smart one,
isn't he?

173
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.096
What are you
going to name him?

174
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.307
I don't know.

175
00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.070
<i>Right away,
Caesar displayed</i>

176
00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.155
<i>signs of
heightened intelligence.</i>

177
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.033
<i>So I kept him and
brought my work home.</i>

178
00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:40.212
<i>By 18 months,</i>

179
00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:44.091
<i>Caesar was
signing up to 24 words.</i>

180
00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.557
<i>By age two,</i>

181
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.517
<i>Caesar was completing
puzzles and models</i>

182
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.353
<i>designed for children
eight years and up.</i>

183
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.694
<i>At age three,</i>

184
00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.988
<i>Caesar continues to
show cognitive skills</i>

185
00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:08.991
<i>that far exceed
that of a human counterpart.</i>

186
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.160
Home. Home.

187
00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.747
He completed the Lucas Tower
in fifteen moves,

188
00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.499
a perfect score.

189
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.918
I maintain my hypothesis

190
00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:23.880
that, A, the green in his eyes
indicates that the ALZ-112

191
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.925
was passed genetically
from mother to son

192
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.305
and, B, that in the absence of
damaged cells that need replacing,

193
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.932
the drug in his
system has radically

194
00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.310
boosted healthy
brain functioning.

195
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.023
And,

196
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.735
he plays chess pretty well.

197
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.904
It's my lamp!
And my room!

198
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.116
Dad?

199
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.869
I don't need you here.
Irena, I'm sorry.

200
00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.579
I can't do this anymore.

201
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:59.041
He belongs in a home.
This is no way for him to live.

202
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.713
Yeah,
and no way to live.

203
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.132
No way to live.

204
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.387
Now, it's my lamp.
I'm always...

205
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.319
It'll
make you better, Dad.

206
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.460
Shh!

207
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:49.901
Dad?

208
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.070
Dad?

209
00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.888
Todd!
Come inside for breakfast!

210
00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.618
I'll need to keep track
of what I take from the lab.

211
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:42.245
Although, I don't foresee you needing
more than one treatment a month.

212
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:43.914
Something amazing has happened.
Yeah.

213
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.793
I'll need a blood test,
and a scan and the dosage.

214
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.169
You'll have to be
carefully monitored.

215
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:50.462
Will...

216
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:51.755
Now if I can sneak some...

217
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.131
Will!
Yeah?

218
00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.257
I'm not sick anymore.

219
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.552
It was nothing, Dad.

220
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.013
Caesar. Where's Caesar?
I want to see him.

221
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.064
Caesar?

222
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:15.987
Caesar!

223
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.532
All right,
he can't have gone far.

224
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.367
Caesar!

225
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:22.786
Daddy? Daddy!

226
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.162
Caesar!

227
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:26.456
Get out of here!
Get out!

228
00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:32.212
Get out!
Get out of here!

229
00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:35.090
Hey, hey, hey!
Enough! Enough!

230
00:19:36.092 --> 00:19:37.425
The hell is
the matter with you?

231
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.761
If I see that animal anywhere
near my house or my kids again...

232
00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:40.971
He's not dangerous.

233
00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.014
It won't happen again.

234
00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.975
Damn right, it won't.

235
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.685
Come on, Dad.

236
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.520
He just wanted to play.

237
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.190
Stay in the house.
Daddy's got it.

238
00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:55.527
I told you not to
go out without us.

239
00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:58.446
Oh, God. It's okay.

240
00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.575
How bad is it?

241
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:03.493
I don't know.

242
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.348
He likes you.

243
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.892
Mmm-hmm.

244
00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.101
Don't worry.

245
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:31.187
It'll be over soon
and we can go get a treat.

246
00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.647
I'm thinking ice cream.

247
00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:39.446
Good idea.

248
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:42.407
You taught him to sign?

249
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.826
Just a handful of things.

250
00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.369
Basic stuff.

251
00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:49.998
What's he saying?

252
00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.124
Nothing.

253
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.169
So, when do you think
we should come back?

254
00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:55.879
Well, you won't need
to come back

255
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.715
because the stitches
are dissolvable.

256
00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.343
I would just say watch out
for signs of infection.

257
00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.136
Fever, redness.

258
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.183
Okay. What's he saying now?

259
00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:14.814
Well, he thinks that you and I
should have dinner together.

260
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.029
I know.

261
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.868
Hey, Caesar. Come on.

262
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.287
Good to see you
again, Caroline.

263
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.581
You coming, Caesar?

264
00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:32.916
So, what's your secret?

265
00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:36.878
I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.

266
00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:41.216
I think you're being very
modest. He's pretty amazing.

267
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.887
I think you've built a pretty
good home for Caesar here.

268
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.305
But?

269
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.392
He won't stay
this way for long.

270
00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:54.187
He's gonna soon grow into a large,
powerful animal.

271
00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:56.272
Come here.

272
00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.234
How has he been doing?

273
00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.819
Okay. I think.

274
00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:05.949
I love chimpanzees.
I'm also afraid of them.

275
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.827
And it's appropriate
to be afraid of them.

276
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.413
Caesar would
never hurt anyone.

277
00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:13.456
Hey! Hey!

278
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.084
He's happy here. Come on.

279
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:17.961
Yeah, I can see that.

280
00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:22.173
Can we at least give him
some open space?

281
00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:24.634
Yeah. That probably
would be a good idea.

282
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:32.767
I know a place right across the bridge.
The redwoods. It's paradise.

283
00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.618
Come on. Come on.

284
00:22:51.954 --> 00:22:52.954
Come here.

285
00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:55.248
He doesn't need a leash.
He'll be fine. Come on.

286
00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.167
Just to be safe.
Come on.

287
00:22:57.251 --> 00:22:59.002
Come on, Caesar.

288
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:04.966
This is the redwoods.

289
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:16.519
Caesar? All right.

290
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:20.982
If I take this off,
you cannot leave my sight.

291
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.569
I would never
find you again. Okay.

292
00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:28.114
What is this?

293
00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:29.324
What's he doing?

294
00:23:29.825 --> 00:23:31.242
I don't believe that.

295
00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:32.702
What?

296
00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:34.329
He's asking
your permission.

297
00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:36.623
It's a supplicating gesture.

298
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:39.000
It's okay.

299
00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:43.588
Come on, Caesar.
Off you go!

300
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.518
Look at him go.

301
00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:58.728
Caesar!

302
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.021
Caesar!

303
00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.484
Caesar!
Caesar!

304
00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:08.113
Caesar!

305
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:15.620
There you are.

306
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:18.206
Caesar?

307
00:24:22.128 --> 00:24:23.920
Go on, Caesar. Climb!

308
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:29.843
Go higher.

309
00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:34.722
Climb!

310
00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.438
Just be careful.

311
00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:46.067
Caesar, be careful!

312
00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:38.995
Hi.

313
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.957
What's going on, buddy?

314
00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:45.543
You get some love, too.

315
00:25:46.837 --> 00:25:48.379
Come on, honey.

316
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.924
Is that a chimpanzee?

317
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:52.175
Hi.

318
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:58.598
Come on!

319
00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:02.977
Come on.

320
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.610
Caesar? Caesar.

321
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.071
Come on.

322
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:15.698
It's all right. Come on.

323
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:20.995
All right, come on.

324
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:28.294
Let's go. You getting in?

325
00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:32.173
Caesar?

326
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.860
You okay, pal?

327
00:26:56.407 --> 00:26:58.199
Are you a pet? No.

328
00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:01.202
You're not a pet.

329
00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:08.960
I'm your father.

330
00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.718
What is Caesar?

331
00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:21.014
Okay.

332
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.690
Caesar, this is
where I work.

333
00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:33.818
This is where you were born.

334
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:37.405
Your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.

335
00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:43.119
But she's not here anymore.

336
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:45.580
So,

337
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:49.917
that's why I took you
home to live with me.

338
00:27:57.343 --> 00:27:58.426
Yeah.

339
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:02.055
Your mother is dead.

340
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:07.435
The thing is,
she was given medicine.

341
00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:11.356
Like the medicine
I give to Charles.

342
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.108
She passed it on to you.

343
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:16.402
That's why you're so smart.

344
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.741
Let's take him home.

345
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:25.078
Okay.

346
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:40.009
Come on,
explain it to me.

347
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.011
All right.

348
00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.890
I snuck him out of
the lab to save his life.

349
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.725
I had no idea that
the effects had been

350
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.477
transferred vertically
from his mother.

351
00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:51.396
But since then,
he's been displaying

352
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.689
incredible signs
of intelligence.

353
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.942
I designed
the 112 for repair,

354
00:28:56.026 --> 00:28:57.819
but Caesar has gone
way beyond that.

355
00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:01.197
Here is his IQ
from last year.

356
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.199
Since then, it's doubled.

357
00:29:05.786 --> 00:29:07.161
This is wrong, Will.

358
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:10.456
My father was gone.
This drug brought him back.

359
00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:12.208
You never saw
how bad he was.

360
00:29:12.668 --> 00:29:13.709
He has his life again.

361
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.002
And what about Caesar?

362
00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:16.212
What about him?

363
00:29:16.296 --> 00:29:17.839
Where does he fit in?

364
00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:19.924
With me.

365
00:29:20.968 --> 00:29:22.009
With us.

366
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:23.803
Listen,

367
00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:26.139
I know it's been
hard for you,

368
00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:29.475
but you're trying to control things
that are not meant to be controlled.

369
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.602
The 112 works.

370
00:29:32.146 --> 00:29:33.604
Do you
realize how you sound?

371
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:36.190
All I'm saying is,
this is a good thing.

372
00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:39.360
Caesar is proof of that.
So is my father.

373
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:45.283
Caesar, eat your food.

374
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.478
Dad, are you okay?

375
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:15.855
Yeah, I'm fine.

376
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:26.240
Antibodies.

377
00:30:26.742 --> 00:30:29.744
His system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus

378
00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:31.913
so that it can't
deliver its therapy.

379
00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:36.542
<i>My father's disease is going
to return with a vengeance.</i>

380
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.637
Honey,
have you seen the car wax?

381
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:49.138
It's a Mustang.

382
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.563
It's looking great.
What did I do...

383
00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:27.301
Stop!

384
00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:31.806
You stop
right now!

385
00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:33.474
Hey! Hey!

386
00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:36.477
Get out of there!
Get out of that car!

387
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:39.063
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!

388
00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:42.483
I said get out of my car!

389
00:31:43.777 --> 00:31:45.820
I'm a pilot!
I got to get to the airport!

390
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.321
How am I going to
get there now, huh?

391
00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:50.241
Answer the goddamned question!
What were you doing?

392
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:51.492
I have a car just...

393
00:31:51.994 --> 00:31:53.035
Well, it's not obviously...

394
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.745
That's it, I'm done.
The police can handle this.

395
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:58.583
You stay right there!
You are going nowhere, mister!

396
00:31:58.667 --> 00:31:59.959
You or your son are
going to pay for this!

397
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.460
But I sure as
hell am not going to!

398
00:32:01.545 --> 00:32:03.671
This is your problem!
You made the mess!

399
00:32:07.009 --> 00:32:08.426
I'm sick of the two of you!
I'm not going...

400
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.094
You stay right there!

401
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:12.555
No!

402
00:32:48.425 --> 00:32:49.717
No!

403
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.011
No! No!

404
00:32:54.014 --> 00:32:55.473
Caesar! Stop!

405
00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:58.434
Daddy!

406
00:33:04.066 --> 00:33:05.399
No, no.

407
00:33:07.778 --> 00:33:08.986
Caesar!

408
00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.248
It's okay.

409
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:25.336
It's okay.
You didn't mean it.

410
00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.214
It's okay.

411
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:54.407
Hey. Take that
thing off of him.

412
00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:58.035
Will you take that thing off of him?
Come on.

413
00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.870
Look. I'll take
him in. Okay?

414
00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:02.039
No, he's under court orders.
You can't do that.

415
00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:03.624
It's fine, let him.

416
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.960
Bring him in
when you're ready.

417
00:34:06.253 --> 00:34:07.378
Take it off.

418
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:08.629
Thank you.

419
00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:12.216
Caesar, Caesar,
Caesar, Caesar? Caesar.

420
00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:16.053
Not right now.
It's gonna be okay.

421
00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:18.347
Let's just see what
it's like inside. Okay?

422
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:22.351
Come on, Caesar. Let's go.

423
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.816
Come on. Trust me.

424
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:45.875
It's okay.

425
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920
Go on.

426
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.723
He hasn't spent any time
with other chimps.

427
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:02.725
We're used to that.

428
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:06.061
He'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.

429
00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:11.984
You'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.

430
00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.070
We provide
a stimulating environment.

431
00:35:15.864 --> 00:35:17.907
He's going to thrive here.

432
00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:19.950
Come on,
let's do some paperwork.

433
00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:23.245
Oh, and make sure you lock
that door when you come in.

434
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.145
Caesar.

435
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.065
It's gonna be okay.

436
00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:53.859
Everything is gonna be okay.

437
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.987
Don't be scared.

438
00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:59.323
You're gonna stay here now.

439
00:36:02.118 --> 00:36:03.244
No.

440
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.205
We're not going
home right now.

441
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.623
It's okay.

442
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.710
In our experience,
the longer you drag out the goodbyes,

443
00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:13.754
the harder it is.

444
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:16.173
Can I just
sign that later?

445
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:20.803
You'll probably miss him
more than he'll miss you.

446
00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:22.847
Best give him a couple of weeks
to get used to the place.

447
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.682
Will, we have to go.

448
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.726
We have to go home.

449
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.854
I'm coming back soon. Okay?

450
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:38.153
Just call ahead
before you do.

451
00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.909
Hey, over here!

452
00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:47.788
Hey, I can get you out!

453
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:53.878
Come on. Over here.

454
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:09.643
Come on. Hey. Down here.

455
00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:24.325
Stupid monkey.

456
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:49.767
Is that all you got? Come on!
It's a madhouse!

457
00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:51.810
It's a madhouse!

458
00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.195
Court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.

459
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.113
Once it comes through,
it'll take about 90 days

460
00:38:03.198 --> 00:38:04.448
before you
receive an appeal date.

461
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:06.325
90 days?
Yes, sir, 90 days.

462
00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:08.452
You'll be notified by mail.
Hang on.

463
00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:10.329
Right. Here's what's
gonna happen.

464
00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.956
You're going to go
back on your computer,

465
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.749
you're gonna
shift things around,

466
00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:15.125
and you're going
to get me a date

467
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.502
for my appeal this week.
You got it?

468
00:38:17.045 --> 00:38:18.295
I can't help you.

469
00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:19.880
All right,
then we have a problem.

470
00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:21.340
Because I'm not
moving until you do.

471
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.968
90 days, sir.

472
00:38:24.052 --> 00:38:26.553
Be thankful you're talking
about court dates.

473
00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:28.722
You're lucky they didn't
put that animal down.

474
00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:34.186
I promise to
get him back soon, Dad.

475
00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:37.690
Dad?

476
00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:47.992
<i>My father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,</i>

477
00:38:48.076 --> 00:38:50.577
<i>rendering the gene
therapy obsolete.</i>

478
00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:55.958
His health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

479
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.545
I need a more
aggressive virus strain.

480
00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:01.630
A faster delivery method.

481
00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:04.550
Because at this rate...

482
00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:14.393
I can't lose them both.

483
00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:21.859
I won't lose them both.

484
00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:26.405
Hi. Can we talk?

485
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:29.033
Make it fast.
I've got a meeting.

486
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.952
In the 10 years
you've been running Gen-Sys,

487
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.329
how many drugs
have come down the pipeline

488
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:36.373
that could save
millions of lives,

489
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.876
that could
change everything?

490
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.711
What are you talking about?

491
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.504
The ALZ-112.

492
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.550
What happened
to you, Will?

493
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:48.719
You used to be
the star of this lab.

494
00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:50.971
Now you hardly ever show,
and when you do,

495
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:54.600
you waste your time and that of your
team's fixating on a drug that,

496
00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:57.311
after what happened, is never,
ever going to get approved.

497
00:39:57.687 --> 00:40:00.773
The 112 is dangerous, Will,
and it doesn't work.

498
00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:03.859
I treated my father with it.
It does work.

499
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:09.114
You did what? You did what?

500
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.366
He beat the disease.
Like we predicted.

501
00:40:11.493 --> 00:40:13.827
Bring him in.
There's been a complication.

502
00:40:13.912 --> 00:40:15.162
Well, does it work,
or doesn't it?

503
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.748
My father's disease
eventually outran the cure.

504
00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:19.249
For goodness sake.

505
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:22.961
His immune system produced antibodies
that beat the viral component,

506
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:24.254
but it will work.

507
00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:26.465
I've already
developed a virus strain

508
00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:28.634
that I think will
be more aggressive.

509
00:40:28.718 --> 00:40:30.260
You think?

510
00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:32.096
Just let me test it.

511
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:34.932
You're wasting my time.

512
00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:36.517
There's more.

513
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.355
The applications go
beyond the disease.

514
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:42.564
There are
indications that show

515
00:40:42.649 --> 00:40:46.485
that therapy can improve cognitive
functioning, memory quality...

516
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:48.821
What are you saying?

517
00:40:49.531 --> 00:40:52.991
My father didn't just recover.
He improved.

518
00:40:54.035 --> 00:40:55.327
You mean
increased intelligence?

519
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:57.704
It's not conclusive,
but yes.

520
00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:05.212
I want you to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps ASAP.

521
00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.296
Okay.

522
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:07.756
I'll give you
whatever you need.

523
00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:09.216
Absolutely.

524
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.847
Dinner time!

525
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.775
Mmm.

526
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.652
Grade A primate chow.

527
00:41:30.864 --> 00:41:32.072
Go on.

528
00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.408
Don't you know food
when you see it?

529
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:47.462
You think that's funny, huh?

530
00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:52.050
I'll show you
something funny.

531
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:07.441
He'll learn who's boss
soon enough.

532
00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:11.904
What about his clothes?
What about them?

533
00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:12.988
I don't know.

534
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:16.658
It might cause problems
with the other apes.

535
00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:19.703
Good.

536
00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:24.643
I've counted
10 apes. Correct?

537
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:25.894
Yep.

538
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:27.437
Good.
All the way to the back.

539
00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:28.605
Okay.

540
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:34.111
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?

541
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:36.029
First day back,
and you're still complaining.

542
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.256
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

543
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.892
Okay. This one.

544
00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:08.770
He's very calm.

545
00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:10.814
Yeah, this guy has seen the
inside of a whole lot of labs.

546
00:44:10.898 --> 00:44:12.649
He knows the drill.

547
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:15.569
Thought I'd join you.

548
00:44:15.737 --> 00:44:17.446
Watch our progress.

549
00:44:18.281 --> 00:44:19.990
Get him prepped.

550
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:26.371
Tighten your masks.

551
00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:28.290
Pass me the 113.

552
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:31.668
Pulse-ox is good,
blood pressure steady.

553
00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:39.092
Aerosol delivery in place.

554
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.974
Releasing the 113.

555
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:06.661
Franklin, get your mask on!

556
00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:11.291
Got it?
Yeah.

557
00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:12.751
Tighten the straps.

558
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.086
You okay?

559
00:45:14.504 --> 00:45:15.837
Yeah, okay.

560
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.221
Move it! Let's go!

561
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:27.641
Get up and exercise,
you lazy baboons!

562
00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:14.558
Intelligence results are remarkable.
No adverse effects.

563
00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:16.726
Apes have amazingly
strong immune systems.

564
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:19.437
Yeah. All right,
keep an eye on it.

565
00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:20.772
Okay.

566
00:48:21.857 --> 00:48:23.024
Sorry about that.

567
00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:26.403
These guys are more
resilient than I am.

568
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.074
Excuse me a sec.

569
00:49:02.356 --> 00:49:05.400
Hurt bad?

570
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.363
You know sign?

571
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:14.075
Circus Orangutan.

572
00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:26.588
He's good.

573
00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:33.470
Careful. Human no like smart Ape.

574
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.896
I want you
working late tonight.

575
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.231
Gen-Sys needs
three more of them.

576
00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:08.546
Hey. Hey. Hey!

577
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:13.843
Hey.
Hey, Caesar. Hi.

578
00:50:13.928 --> 00:50:15.428
Are you hurt?

579
00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:18.181
Are you hurt?

580
00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:19.808
Show me.

581
00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:25.397
Caesar.
Give me your hand.

582
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.148
Give me your hand.
It's okay.

583
00:50:27.233 --> 00:50:29.359
Sometimes the new kid on
the block gets picked on.

584
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:32.237
Don't worry.
God, what have they done to you?

585
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.281
That's bullshit.
What the hell did you do?

586
00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:36.533
Let go, man.

587
00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:38.284
Hey! What's the
problem here?

588
00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:42.330
I'm taking him out of here.
Right now.

589
00:50:42.456 --> 00:50:44.958
Not without a court order,
you're not.

590
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:46.835
He's not yours anymore.

591
00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:50.255
I promise, if I find out he's
been mistreated in any way,

592
00:50:50.339 --> 00:50:52.340
I'll have this
place shut down.

593
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:55.468
Go on.

594
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:57.929
Hey. Hi.

595
00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:01.057
Hey.

596
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.103
No.

597
00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:07.564
No, we're not
going home right now.

598
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.235
But I'm going to get you out of here.
I promise.

599
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:16.072
You have to trust me.

600
00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:19.159
Caesar, you have
to trust me. Okay?

601
00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:21.327
I think this visit is over.

602
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:24.372
Trust me. It'll be okay.

603
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.668
Come on!
Move it! Let's go!

604
00:52:57.925 --> 00:52:59.592
Wow!
There's hundreds of them.

605
00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:01.469
This is like
your own private zoo.

606
00:53:01.554 --> 00:53:02.846
More like
a prison for hairy dudes.

607
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.723
They watch TV?

608
00:53:05.933 --> 00:53:07.767
We call it enrichment.

609
00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:12.188
This one's so cute!

610
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:14.691
What's his name?

611
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.778
The name is Cornelia.
It's a she.

612
00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:21.865
Oh, my God!
Don't get too close.

613
00:53:21.949 --> 00:53:23.616
This one
scared me half to death.

614
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.827
Yeah. That big
guy's called Maurice.

615
00:53:26.412 --> 00:53:27.620
No fun.

616
00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:30.707
Here, I'll show you
something fun.

617
00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:36.129
Check this out.

618
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.967
Are you insane?

619
00:53:42.303 --> 00:53:44.053
You shouldn't be in here.

620
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:45.471
Hey, you're next!

621
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:54.105
Come on, let's go.

622
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:56.482
I spend too much time
in here as it is.

623
00:53:58.527 --> 00:53:59.569
Come on.

624
00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:01.404
Check out this guy.

625
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:03.364
Hey, that one
is a pain in the ass.

626
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:04.490
Thinks he's
special or something.

627
00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:07.952
Freaky.

628
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:10.413
Hey, come here.

629
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.082
It's like he's thinking
or something...

630
00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:17.045
Oh, my God!
He's got his throat!

631
00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:18.504
Let him go!
Let go!

632
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:23.551
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

633
00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:26.596
I told you not to
get too close, man.

634
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.514
Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

635
00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:16.177
Hey.

636
00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:20.514
Some things aren't
meant to be changed.

637
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:23.226
You need to accept that.

638
00:59:27.022 --> 00:59:28.606
Hey!

639
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.567
Hey! What's going on here?

640
00:59:31.652 --> 00:59:33.152
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping...

641
00:59:33.237 --> 00:59:35.947
No, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first.

642
00:59:36.031 --> 00:59:37.114
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?

643
00:59:37.658 --> 00:59:39.575
He's been out sick
for two days.

644
00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.327
Well, I didn't
authorize this.

645
00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.246
No.

646
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.497
I did.

647
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:47.041
We agreed to test
sparingly on one subject.

648
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:49.502
And that one subject
is stunning.

649
00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:52.755
It's a virus, we don't know
the human-related effects.

650
00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:56.092
The drug works, Will.
Tell him, Linda.

651
00:59:56.176 --> 00:59:59.553
For starters,
Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

652
00:59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.639
Every test result
verifies its effectiveness.

653
01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:03.266
No more tests.
What are you...

654
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.559
Not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.

655
01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:08.604
Look, I'll tell you exactly what we're...
Look. Just give us a minute.

656
01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:11.107
Excuse me, put the ape back in the cage,
and be gentle.

657
01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.860
Will, I'll tell you exactly
what we're dealing with here.

658
01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:15.945
We're dealing with a drug

659
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:20.074
that is worth more than everything
else we are developing combined.

660
01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:24.412
You make history, I make money.
Wasn't that our arrangement?

661
01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:25.871
No, there are risks.

662
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.957
Don't talk to me
about risks.

663
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.460
You gave your own father
an experimental drug.

664
01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.796
I could finish your career
with one phone call.

665
01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.382
I'll save you
the trouble. I quit.

666
01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.635
We will proceed
without you.

667
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.223
Look, you don't
know what you're doing.

668
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:45.808
These tests need
to be contained.

669
01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.978
You have no idea if
the 113 is stable,

670
01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.646
what kind of damage
it can do to people.

671
01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:53.733
Yes. Well, that is why
we test it on chimps.

672
01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.818
Isn't it?

673
01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.114
Dr. Rodman, it's me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!

674
01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.199
Can you come to the door?

675
01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:16.630
Doc?

676
01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.591
Who the hell are you?

677
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.055
Get out of here!

678
01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.931
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

679
01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.116
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?

680
01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:51.207
Well, I can't say I approve.

681
01:01:52.793 --> 01:01:54.085
They're not people,
you know.

682
01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:55.836
You gonna let him go or not?

683
01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.977
Caesar? Hey, come on.

684
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.939
Come on, we're going home.

685
01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:18.692
Home.

686
01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.028
Come on,
we're really going.

687
01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.907
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

688
01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah.

689
01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:37.128
Come on.

690
01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.846
Caesar?

691
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:52.351
I guess he likes it better
here with his own kind.

692
01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.923
Why cookie Rocket?

693
01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.722
Apes alone...

694
01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.766
weak.

695
01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:43.355
Apes together strong.

696
01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:58.621
Apes stupid.

697
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.841
Damn it, Rodney!
You leave the hose out in the atrium again?

698
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.217
What? No!

699
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:37.988
Come on! Let's go!

700
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.411
Come on, get up!

701
01:09:34.963 --> 01:09:36.421
<i>Eight months
after its launch,</i>

702
01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.632
<i>Earth's first manned
space flight to Mars...</i>

703
01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.467
I swear, Dodge,
I'm telling the truth.

704
01:09:40.552 --> 01:09:42.511
Yeah, well, if you didn't take my
cookies then who the hell did?

705
01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.096
I don't know.
Hey!

706
01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.974
Will you two morons
knock it off?

707
01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.394
I'm going home.

708
01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.024
I get more peace
in the goddamn ape house.

709
01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.651
Dad, I'm sorry.

710
01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:00.362
Well done, Rodney.

711
01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.488
I swear...

712
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.836
Mr. Franklin? It's Dottie.

713
01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:05.844
Mr. Franklin?

714
01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:07.846
Hello?

715
01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.329
What the hell?

716
01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:40.003
<i>God said, "Let the waters bring
forth moving creatures..."</i>

717
01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:42.464
<i>Rodney, get to
the platform now.</i>

718
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.929
Rodney!

719
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.985
What the hell do you
think you're doing, huh?

720
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:18.917
Get!

721
01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:25.382
Go on. Get back
in your cage.

722
01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:28.176
I'm warning you.

723
01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.557
Go on, get!

724
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.395
That's it.

725
01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:42.482
See? That's what
you get! Now get back!

726
01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.027
What's wrong with you?

727
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.613
Dumb monkey!

728
01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.045
Take your stinking paw off me,
you damn dirty ape!

729
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:07.632
No!

730
01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:21.855
No!

731
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.656
No! No! No!

732
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.576
No! No!

733
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.119
No!

734
01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.334
No!

735
01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:49.734
I swear I'm gonna skin
each and every one of you!

736
01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.048
Caroline, have you been up
to Caesar's room?

737
01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.263
No one is answering.

738
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:33.421
Landon?

739
01:17:03.995 --> 01:17:05.120
Will?

740
01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.707
Will!

741
01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.255
What happened?

742
01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:16.881
He spoke.

743
01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.802
What do you... What?

744
01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:22.679
Your ape.

745
01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.390
He spoke.

746
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.938
What in the hell?

747
01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:16.649
I don't believe this.

748
01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.277
<i>...I'm gonna skin each
and every one of you!</i>

749
01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:25.658
I need someone to coordinate with the SFPD.
Tell them we got a fatality.

750
01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:26.951
What is it?

751
01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.578
I know where he's headed.

752
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:39.839
Len?

753
01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:42.634
Let's go.

754
01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.246
Jacobs.

755
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:13.581
<i>Mr. Jacobs, it's Linda
from Will's team.</i>

756
01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.500
<i>Something horrible
has happened.</i>

757
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.294
<i>Franklin is dead,
from a viral infection.</i>

758
01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.004
The hell are you
talking about?

759
01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.048
<i>He was exposed to the 113.</i>

760
01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.217
<i>It does something to people
that it doesn't do to apes.</i>

761
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.930
He'll have to go through the
city and across the bridge.

762
01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:32.058
<i>Mr. Jacobs?
Mr. Jacobs, are you...</i>

763
01:19:32.143 --> 01:19:33.143
What the hell?

764
01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:07.051
Steven Jacobs!

765
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:09.053
This is my facility.
We've had a breach.

766
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.472
We need to get up in the air

767
01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.765
and track them down
and destroy them! Okay?

768
01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.142
Wait a sec!
Wait a second.

769
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.103
Look. You've got to
trust me on this! Okay?

770
01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.333
You guys might want to get
your cameras ready.

771
01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.919
Normally these guys
are quite shy.

772
01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.405
They just tore through a
park on the north side.

773
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.199
They're being led!

774
01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.283
Got to hold the button!

775
01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.868
What?
The button!

776
01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:16.704
They're being led!
These apes are smarter than you think!

777
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.248
<i>We've got to kill the leader!</i>

778
01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:13.988
No, you do not tell them
I am stuck in traffic.

779
01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:16.741
You make up something smarter!
Hold on.

780
01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.119
What the...

781
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.260
They're on the bridge.

782
01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:38.638
They're trying to
get to the redwoods.

783
01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.811
<i>SFPD Police One,
this is Air Ops.</i>

784
01:23:44.895 --> 01:23:48.356
<i>Seal off the south end.
What's the status of the mounted units?</i>

785
01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.565
<i>Good to go, sir.</i>

786
01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:52.276
<i>All right.
As soon as they reach you, push north!</i>

787
01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.913
<i>North side, we're going
to push them right to you.</i>

788
01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:05.373
<i>No problem,
we're ready for them.</i>

789
01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:06.791
North side is locked.

790
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.293
<i>They'll never
get through here.</i>

791
01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:23.224
As soon as they hit the gap,
we'll take them out!

792
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:24.559
You're going to shoot them?

793
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.018
Like shooting
fish in a barrel.

794
01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.104
Good.

795
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:34.986
Turn that thing around. Keep moving.
Get off this bridge, sir.

796
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.821
No, you don't understand.
You don't understand!

797
01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.741
Get off this bridge now!
This is an evacuation. Get out!

798
01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.743
All civilians clear.
<i>Please confirm.</i>

799
01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.494
Get these people
off the bridge!

800
01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:50.585
Wait!

801
01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:04.682
Go up.

802
01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:15.526
Get under.

803
01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.751
Stand by to send
in mounted units.

804
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.671
They're gonna
slaughter them.

805
01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:39.801
I'm going to get Caesar.

806
01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:41.135
Hey. Hey, hey.

807
01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.428
Listen.

808
01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:46.557
You be careful.

809
01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:48.893
Hey!

810
01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:51.646
Get down from there.
You're not allowed up there.

811
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.898
But I have to get to my car!
Let go of me!

812
01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.525
I've got to get to my car.
It's important!

813
01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:56.692
Hey!

814
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.905
Push them north!

815
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.579
Get out of the way!

816
01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:52.290
No!

817
01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.767
<i>Quick or you'll lose
them in the fog!</i>

818
01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:13.102
Do it!

819
01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.328
Where are they?
I can't see them.

820
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.209
CHP North,
do you have a visual?

821
01:27:37.294 --> 01:27:38.461
No, sir. Negative.

822
01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:07.949
Safeties off!

823
01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:31.222
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

824
01:29:18.145 --> 01:29:20.938
<i>Get back! Get back!
Everybody, pull back!</i>

825
01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.128
Caesar!

826
01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.941
That's him.
That's the leader.

827
01:30:12.783 --> 01:30:15.367
<i>255, come in!
Are you there?</i>

828
01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:47.251
Help me.

829
01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:50.337
Help me.

830
01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.146
Take my hand.

831
01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.273
Come on. Come on.

832
01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.444
Come on.

833
01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:17.948
Come on.

834
01:32:19.618 --> 01:32:20.659
No.

835
01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.417
Come on.

836
01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.629
Not you.

837
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.715
No! No!

838
01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.263
Stupid monkey!

839
01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.641
No! No!

840
01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:45.202
Caesar!

841
01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:53.335
Caesar?

842
01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.585
Caesar.

843
01:34:36.338 --> 01:34:39.173
I'm sorry.
This is my fault.

844
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.719
This has to stop.
This isn't the way.

845
01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.472
You know what
they're capable of.

846
01:34:48.475 --> 01:34:49.892
Please come home.

847
01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:53.979
If you come home,
I'll protect you.

848
01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:15.918
Caesar is home.

849
01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:24.134
Okay.

850
01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:27.596
Caesar is home.

851
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:31.892
Go.
