00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.239
<i>They say Japan was made by a sword.</i>

2
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.759
<i>They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean,</i>

3
00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:40.719
<i>and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea,</i>

4
00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:44.359
<i>and those drops became
the islands of Japan.</i>

5
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.439
<i>I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men...</i>

6
00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.559
<i>warriors willing to give their lives,</i>

7
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.399
<i>for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:</i>

8
00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.079
<i>Honor.</i>

9
00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.839
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

10
00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.319
America's leader in all forms of armament
used by the United States Army

11
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.399
celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

12
00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.679
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

13
00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.559
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry

14
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.279
on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg.

15
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.439
He is late of the 7th Cavalry,

16
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.759
and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the Indian nations.

17
00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.239
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you:

18
00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.559
Captain Nathan Algren!

19
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.959
Captain Nathan Algren!

20
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.959
Yes!

21
00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.119
Yes!

22
00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.519
One moment, ladies and gentlemen.

23
00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.559
Goddamn you, Algren, get out there!

24
00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.959
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

25
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.079
Come on! I'm sick of this!

26
00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.599
Come on!

27
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.879
Yes!

28
00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.159
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

29
00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.879
This, ladies and gents

30
00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.119
is the gun that's winning the West.

31
00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.439
Why, many's the time I've found myself...

32
00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.679
surrounded by a swarm of...

33
00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.919
angry hostiles

34
00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.759
with nothing but this rifle

35
00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.599
between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

36
00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.039
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

37
00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.279
is a fearsome enemy.

38
00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.199
And if he'd had his way

39
00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.719
why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone,

40
00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.479
and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

41
00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.959
Like those poor bastards out there...

42
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.759
on the Little Bighorn.

43
00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.999
Bodies stripped bare...

44
00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.079
mutilated.

45
00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.839
Left to rot in the sun.

46
00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.399
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

47
00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.399
Trapper.

48
00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:45.199
It's got a seven-shot capacity.
Accurate 400 yards, one round per second.

49
00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:48.719
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

50
00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.759
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

51
00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.239
That's right, missy.

52
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.319
This beauty.

53
00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.999
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

54
00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.039
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

55
00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.039
My thanks on behalf of those who died

56
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.839
in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

57
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.319
and commercial opportunities.

58
00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.959
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

59
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.479
God bless you all.

60
00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.519
I must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

61
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.999
- You're alive.
- I am, indeed.

62
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.239
Your man Custer says to me,
"We're going to the Little Bighorn."

63
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.839
Says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?"
It's the walking ticket for me.

64
00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.799
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.

65
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.959
I have a good job for the both of us.

66
00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:06.799
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

67
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:08.999
What kind of a job?

68
00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.959
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

69
00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.999
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

70
00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.759
Nathan!

71
00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.199
Just listen to what your man has to say.

72
00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.359
Been a while.
It's good to see you.

73
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.479
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan,

74
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.639
and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.

75
00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.959
Sit down, please.

76
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.039
Whiskey.

77
00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:50.679
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

78
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.719
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes

79
00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.559
to hire white experts
to train their army.

80
00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.719
And if we play our cards right

81
00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.519
the Emperor grants the U.S.
exclusive rights to supply arms.

82
00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.399
Well, I have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

83
00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:15.879
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

84
00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:21.479
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

85
00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.319
We will pay you $400 a month.

86
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.839
Five. For each.

87
00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.519
And another 500 when we get the job done.

88
00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:41.559
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

89
00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:49.959
Whiskey.

90
00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:52.999
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

91
00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:57.759
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

92
00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.079
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?

93
00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.559
The word you might use is "warrior."

94
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.359
Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences
dealing with renegades.

95
00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.439
Is he?

96
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.239
He's even read your book.

97
00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:13.559
Captain Algren's study of the tribes

98
00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:16.679
was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

99
00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.559
Please excuse. What is funny?

100
00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:39.359
The corps back together again.
It's just so...

101
00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.559
inspiring!

102
00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:49.239
Excuse me.

103
00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.759
I need to use the necessities.

104
00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:01.319
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

105
00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.999
Colonel Bagley.

106
00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.759
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer,

107
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.399
and you assured us of his participation.

108
00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:12.799
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.

109
00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:16.759
Nathan.

110
00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:21.519
I did what I was ordered to do out there.

111
00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.599
And I have no remorse.

112
00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:27.639
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

113
00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:35.719
- You want me to kill Jappos, I'll kill them.
- I'm not asking you to kill anybody.

114
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:39.599
You want me to kill the enemies of Jappos,
I'll kill their enemies.

115
00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:43.479
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...

116
00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:47.159
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.

117
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.719
But keep one thing in mind...

118
00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.159
I'd happily kill you for free.

119
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.519
<i>July 12th, 1876.</i>

120
00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:15.319
<i>There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.</i>

121
00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.959
<i>No past, no future.</i>

122
00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:26.159
<i>And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances.</i>

123
00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:34.479
<i>I have been hired to help suppress the
rebellion of yet another tribal leader.</i>

124
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:38.399
<i>Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.</i>

125
00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:44.679
<i>I am beset by the ironies of my life.</i>

126
00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:57.239
- Captain Algren, I presume?
- Yes.

127
00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:59.839
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

128
00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:03.559
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

129
00:12:03.719 --> 00:12:05.039
Now look at it.

130
00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:08.439
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western,

131
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:11.639
and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

132
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:14.839
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

133
00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:18.039
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in

134
00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.439
every Western expert he can get.

135
00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:24.519
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland,

136
00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:28.119
and now, of course,
warriors from America.

137
00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:32.839
I came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

138
00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.879
I was soon relieved of my position.

139
00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:37.639
I had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth

140
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.639
in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

141
00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:45.159
So now, I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

142
00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:53.639
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

143
00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:58.359
You have to realize what an honor this is.
It's all highly ritualized, of course.

144
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:01.399
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

145
00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:05.559
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.

146
00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:08.799
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.

147
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.159
Rather snug around the midriff.

148
00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.159
And bow.

149
00:13:30.439 --> 00:13:33.359
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

150
00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:36.759
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

151
00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:42.639
We hope to accomplish the same national
harmony you enjoy in your homeland.

152
00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:53.399
The Emperor is most interested
in your American Indians

153
00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.959
if you have fought
against them in battle.

154
00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:59.279
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

155
00:14:07.599 --> 00:14:09.959
The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren

156
00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:12.799
if it is true they wear eagle feathers,

157
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:16.039
and paint their faces
before going into battle,

158
00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:18.399
and that they have no fear.

159
00:14:21.479 --> 00:14:23.319
They are very brave.

160
00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.439
Bow.

161
00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:44.999
Thank you very much.

162
00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:58.759
And step back.

163
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:04.359
Step back, step back and turn.

164
00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.839
Right, you little bastards!

165
00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:13.679
You will stand up straight
or I will personally shit-kick

166
00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:17.319
every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

167
00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.239
Well done, sergeant.

168
00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:24.639
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

169
00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:27.599
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

170
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:30.199
The second rank...

171
00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:33.359
<i>July 22nd, 1876.</i>

172
00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:38.799
<i>For six months' work, I am to receive
three years of captain's pay</i>

173
00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:41.599
<i>teaching Orientals to soldier.</i>

174
00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.799
<i>They are an army of conscripts.</i>

175
00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:48.959
<i>Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.</i>

176
00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:50.759
Fire!

177
00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:55.399
<i>They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature</i>

178
00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:58.399
<i>who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.</i>

179
00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:02.559
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

180
00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:11.159
<i>He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.</i>

181
00:16:11.319 --> 00:16:13.879
<i>I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.</i>

182
00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.879
Who supplies their weapons?

183
00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:27.519
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

184
00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:29.679
He uses no firearms?

185
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:32.759
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

186
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.679
How well does he know him?

187
00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:38.079
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

188
00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.679
He fought with the Samurai?

189
00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:43.599
He is Samurai.

190
00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:54.759
You must understand. Katsumoto pledged
his sword to defend the Emperor.

191
00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:57.599
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

192
00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.599
Samurai are paradoxical. I've tried to write
about them, but they keep to themselves.

193
00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:05.319
The bastards are still wearing armor.

194
00:17:05.479 --> 00:17:08.679
When the Irish were comporting
themselves in loincloths

195
00:17:08.879 --> 00:17:12.039
these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

196
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:14.359
I need information
on their battle tactics.

197
00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:17.679
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

198
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:22.279
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time. You
should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.

199
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:23.919
Really?

200
00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.919
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

201
00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.319
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

202
00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:33.999
Just "hello" or "goodbye" or...
No, no, no!

203
00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:36.639
"Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil."

204
00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.199
Early day tomorrow, captain.

205
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:45.239
- It's about bedtime, isn't it?
- I always had a fascination with scalping.

206
00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:48.239
I never quite understood its technique.

207
00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:57.759
Imagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

208
00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:02.959
grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless...

209
00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:12.319
and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp

210
00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:14.799
with a saw-like motion.

211
00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:20.559
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

212
00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:25.239
on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles

213
00:18:25.399 --> 00:18:28.159
would have on your nervous system.

214
00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:36.079
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped

215
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:37.399
Mr. Graham.

216
00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:46.399
How soon can you translate those books?

217
00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.599
Right away.

218
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:56.199
I'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

219
00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:59.759
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

220
00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:03.359
I shall not sleep until it is done.

221
00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.359
Sake.

222
00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:10.159
I bid you good night.

223
00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:12.439
Can I get you anything?

224
00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.679
<i>This is a punitive expedition, captain.</i>

225
00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:17.999
Col. Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

226
00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.799
- Good night, sir.
- Quietly now, boys.

227
00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:07.759
Fire!

228
00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:20.599
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

229
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:23.039
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

230
00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:29.799
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

231
00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:33.999
Eye, down the sight.

232
00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:35.839
Now, slowly...

233
00:20:40.879 --> 00:20:42.399
Well done.

234
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.279
Nathan!

235
00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:52.399
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

236
00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:55.799
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

237
00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.199
He must be stopped now.

238
00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.959
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

239
00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:02.439
They're not ready.

240
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:06.439
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

241
00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:10.239
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

242
00:21:10.399 --> 00:21:14.159
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

243
00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:17.879
I am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

244
00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:21.359
You will track him down and engage him.

245
00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.199
Load.

246
00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:29.759
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

247
00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.399
- I beg your pardon?
- Tell this man

248
00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:37.159
if he does not shoot me, I will kill him!

249
00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:41.439
- Captain, if I might have a word.
- Tell him!

250
00:21:42.999 --> 00:21:44.599
Tell him!

251
00:21:50.679 --> 00:21:52.279
Load!

252
00:21:56.199 --> 00:21:57.959
Load!

253
00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.199
Faster!

254
00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:04.799
Faster!

255
00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:11.799
Shoot me, damn it.

256
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:17.959
Fire!

257
00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.239
Fire!

258
00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:49.079
They're not ready.

259
00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:54.559
The regiment leaves at 6 a.m.!

260
00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:29.519
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

261
00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:31.319
It's astonishing.

262
00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:33.599
And Omura owns all of it?

263
00:23:33.759 --> 00:23:36.759
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

264
00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:39.479
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?

265
00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:44.159
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.

266
00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:56.479
Move into position!

267
00:23:57.999 --> 00:24:00.479
1st Company, form a battle line on me!

268
00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:02.639
Pay attention, it will save your life!

269
00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:05.439
2nd Company, form on 1st Company.

270
00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:07.959
3rd and 4th Company, form up behind.

271
00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:09.639
Fill in on command!

272
00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:13.639
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

273
00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:19.159
- Cover down!
- Captain Algren.

274
00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:21.339
We are not here as combatants.

275
00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:24.039
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.

276
00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:27.039
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.

277
00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:28.719
Fix bayonets!

278
00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:37.359
- Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
- Yes, of course.

279
00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:47.079
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

280
00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:50.119
- Did you hear my order?
- I did indeed, sir!

281
00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:52.639
Then you will obey it. Now!

282
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:56.199
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

283
00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:03.439
- Load!
- Load!

284
00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:33.239
Samurai come.

285
00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:36.479
You'll be fine, son.

286
00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:57.199
- Assume firing positions!
- Assume firing positions!

287
00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:13.119
Fire on my order only!

288
00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:36.239
Hold your fire!

289
00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:38.039
Hold your fire!

290
00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:46.999
Reload!

291
00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:53.039
Hold the line!

292
00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:56.559
Fire at will!

293
00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:14.079
Lieutenant, fall back!

294
00:27:57.479 --> 00:27:58.919
Zeb!

295
00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:27.399
What is your name?

296
00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:57.159
This is my son's village.

297
00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:01.039
We are deep in the mountains
and winter is coming. You cannot escape.

298
00:33:04.199 --> 00:33:05.959
Jolly good.

299
00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:58.759
Sake.

300
00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:01.999
Sake?

301
00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:04.439
Sake.

302
00:36:11.799 --> 00:36:13.119
Sake.

303
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:16.879
Sake.

304
00:37:16.879 --> 00:37:18.479
Sake.

305
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:22.279
Sake!

306
00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.959
Please.

307
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.839
Sake.

308
00:37:48.479 --> 00:37:50.959
Sake!

309
00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:00.279
No!

310
00:38:01.439 --> 00:38:03.519
No!

311
00:38:07.479 --> 00:38:10.399
I told you!

312
00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:19.679
No!

313
00:39:03.399 --> 00:39:04.799
Morning.

314
00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:00.679
Go. You, go.

315
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:03.759
What's your name?

316
00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:06.239
You got a name, don't you?

317
00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:12.639
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

318
00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:15.479
I know why you don't talk.

319
00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:18.519
You're angry.

320
00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:21.719
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

321
00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:24.559
Son of a bitch.

322
00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:07.479
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

323
00:42:09.879 --> 00:42:12.439
My name is Katsumoto.

324
00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:15.479
What is your name?

325
00:42:21.479 --> 00:42:24.319
Are my words not correct?

326
00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:31.759
I will practice my English with you...

327
00:42:33.199 --> 00:42:35.079
if you would honor me.

328
00:42:36.879 --> 00:42:38.999
You kept me alive just to speak English?

329
00:42:41.239 --> 00:42:43.039
Then what do you want?

330
00:42:44.319 --> 00:42:45.639
To know my enemy.

331
00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:49.879
I've seen what you do to your enemies.

332
00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:52.199
Warriors in your country do not kill?

333
00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:55.639
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

334
00:42:56.679 --> 00:43:00.359
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

335
00:43:01.919 --> 00:43:05.279
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

336
00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:08.199
I was honored to cut off his head.

337
00:43:11.279 --> 00:43:16.119
Many of our customs seem strange to you.
The same is true of yours.

338
00:43:16.279 --> 00:43:17.799
For example

339
00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:22.959
not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

340
00:43:29.759 --> 00:43:31.519
Nathan Algren.

341
00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:36.479
I am honored to meet you.

342
00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:40.999
- I have enjoyed this conversation in English.
- I have questions.

343
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:44.839
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

344
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:47.159
This is a very good conversation.

345
00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:49.719
- I have questions.
- They come later.

346
00:43:49.879 --> 00:43:52.279
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

347
00:43:53.279 --> 00:43:56.919
- My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
- And the woman who cares for me?

348
00:43:57.239 --> 00:43:59.959
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

349
00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:01.679
Her name is Taka.

350
00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:03.279
I killed her husband?

351
00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:07.399
It was a good death.

352
00:44:20.399 --> 00:44:21.679
You!

353
00:44:55.519 --> 00:44:56.759
Thank you.

354
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:21.159
Nicely done.

355
00:46:26.799 --> 00:46:27.959
You try.

356
00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:30.359
Try.

357
00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:43.839
I just realized, I've been remiss.
Forgive me.

358
00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:47.639
I have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

359
00:49:47.959 --> 00:49:50.199
That is your job, correct?

360
00:49:50.639 --> 00:49:52.319
Protecting me?

361
00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:55.319
Well done, Bob.

362
00:49:55.799 --> 00:49:58.159
You don't mind if I call you "Bob,"
do you?

363
00:49:58.759 --> 00:50:02.759
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

364
00:50:03.719 --> 00:50:05.719
You a ladies' man, Bob?

365
00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:13.479
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

366
00:50:15.159 --> 00:50:16.919
Yes, indeed.

367
00:50:18.799 --> 00:50:22.519
You fought against your Red Indians?

368
00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:28.439
Yes.

369
00:50:28.639 --> 00:50:30.399
Tell me of your part in this war.

370
00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:32.119
- Why?
- I wish to learn.

371
00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:35.639
- Read a book.
- I would rather have a good conversation.

372
00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:37.839
- Why?
- Because

373
00:50:38.039 --> 00:50:39.919
we are both students of war.

374
00:50:47.399 --> 00:50:48.759
So...

375
00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:52.559
you were the general of your army?

376
00:50:54.999 --> 00:50:56.439
No.

377
00:50:57.639 --> 00:51:00.079
I was a captain.

378
00:51:00.479 --> 00:51:02.519
This is a low rank?

379
00:51:04.879 --> 00:51:06.719
A middle rank.

380
00:51:07.959 --> 00:51:09.279
And who was your general?

381
00:51:14.439 --> 00:51:16.839
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

382
00:51:16.999 --> 00:51:20.359
People in your country
do not like conversation?

383
00:51:20.519 --> 00:51:22.959
He was a lieutenant colonel.

384
00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:25.319
His name was Custer.

385
00:51:25.479 --> 00:51:26.759
I know this name.

386
00:51:27.319 --> 00:51:29.199
He killed many warriors.

387
00:51:29.399 --> 00:51:31.039
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

388
00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.399
So he was a good general.

389
00:51:33.559 --> 00:51:37.119
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

390
00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:41.679
He got massacred because he took a single
battalion against 2000 angry Indians.

391
00:51:42.159 --> 00:51:44.599
Two thousand Indians?

392
00:51:44.999 --> 00:51:46.279
How many men for Custer?

393
00:51:46.719 --> 00:51:48.119
Two hundred and eleven.

394
00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:51.559
I like this General Custer.

395
00:51:52.119 --> 00:51:56.119
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

396
00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:58.439
And his troopers died for it.

397
00:51:58.599 --> 00:52:00.679
I think this is a very good death.

398
00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:02.799
Maybe you can have one like it someday.

399
00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:05.199
If it is in my destiny.

400
00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:09.159
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?

401
00:52:11.759 --> 00:52:13.199
What are you doing?

402
00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:15.479
Why are we having these conversations?

403
00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:18.599
What the hell am I doing here?

404
00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:25.359
In spring

405
00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:28.959
the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

406
00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:33.439
Until that time, you are here.

407
00:52:35.279 --> 00:52:38.039
Good day, captain.

408
00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:00.919
<i>1876.</i>

409
00:53:01.079 --> 00:53:04.279
<i>Day unknown. Month unknown.</i>

410
00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:08.959
<i>I continue to live among
these unusual people.</i>

411
00:53:10.239 --> 00:53:13.439
<i>I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.</i>

412
00:53:15.439 --> 00:53:18.119
<i>Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...</i>

413
00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:23.639
<i>as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.</i>

414
00:53:35.279 --> 00:53:38.439
<i>Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.</i>

415
00:53:40.199 --> 00:53:44.799
<i>But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.</i>

416
00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:27.119
<i>They are an intriguing people.</i>

417
00:54:27.479 --> 00:54:29.239
<i>From the moment they wake</i>

418
00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:33.439
<i>they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.</i>

419
00:54:41.959 --> 00:54:44.959
<i>I have never seen such discipline.</i>

420
00:54:45.999 --> 00:54:50.159
<i>I am surprised to learn that the word
"Samurai" means "to serve,"</i>

421
00:54:50.319 --> 00:54:54.879
<i>and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion
to be in the service of the Emperor.</i>

422
00:56:56.759 --> 00:56:59.359
Please forgive. Too many mind.

423
00:57:00.799 --> 00:57:02.599
Too many mind?

424
00:57:03.159 --> 00:57:07.439
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

425
00:57:08.279 --> 00:57:10.079
Too many mind.

426
00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.319
No mind.

427
00:57:15.319 --> 00:57:16.879
No mind.

428
00:57:58.599 --> 00:58:00.999
Not so fast. What are these?

429
00:58:16.959 --> 00:58:18.359
No, no. Not so fast.

430
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:23.799
I'm Algren.

431
00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:34.399
- Nobutada.
- Nobutada.

432
00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.039
- Magojiro.
- Magojiro.

433
00:58:37.199 --> 00:58:38.479
Higen.

434
00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:40.519
Higen.

435
00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:45.399
Taka.

436
00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:56.599
She's been very kind to me.

437
00:59:57.559 --> 01:00:01.559
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

438
01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.719
<i>Winter, 1877.</i>

439
01:00:28.999 --> 01:00:31.639
<i>What does it mean to be Samurai?</i>

440
01:00:31.799 --> 01:00:35.199
<i>To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...</i>

441
01:00:35.919 --> 01:00:38.839
<i>to seek a stillness of your mind...</i>

442
01:00:39.479 --> 01:00:42.719
<i>and to master the way of the sword.</i>

443
01:00:57.239 --> 01:00:58.599
Cold?

444
01:01:10.399 --> 01:01:11.759
Also. Also cold.

445
01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:14.159
Fire.

446
01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:24.319
To burn.

447
01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:24.519
I'm sorry.

448
01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:36.999
For your husband, Hirotaro.

449
01:03:29.319 --> 01:03:32.119
<i>Spring, 1877.</i>

450
01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:37.519
<i>This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 17.</i>

451
01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:44.359
<i>There is so much here
that I'll never understand.</i>

452
01:03:48.719 --> 01:03:51.519
<i>I have never been a church-going man,</i>

453
01:03:51.679 --> 01:03:56.079
<i>and what I've seen on the field of battle
has led me to question God's purpose.</i>

454
01:03:56.279 --> 01:03:58.639
<i>But there is, indeed, something</i>

455
01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:01.879
<i>spiritual in this place.</i>

456
01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:08.599
<i>And though it may forever
be obscure to me</i>

457
01:04:08.759 --> 01:04:12.239
<i>I cannot but be aware of its power.</i>

458
01:04:20.719 --> 01:04:25.679
<i>I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.</i>

459
01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:31.959
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

460
01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:36.279
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

461
01:05:29.639 --> 01:05:31.279
No mind.

462
01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:28.239
Katsumoto!

463
01:11:55.279 --> 01:11:58.559
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

464
01:11:58.759 --> 01:12:03.759
You could spend your life looking for one,
and it would not be a wasted life.

465
01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.559
Who sent those men to kill you?

466
01:12:06.759 --> 01:12:09.839
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.

467
01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:13.239
<i>The tiger's eyes are like my own</i>

468
01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:16.599
<i>But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea</i>

469
01:12:17.519 --> 01:12:19.359
Was it the Emperor?

470
01:12:21.199 --> 01:12:22.519
Omura?

471
01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:26.559
If the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

472
01:12:27.519 --> 01:12:29.359
So it was Omura.

473
01:12:29.919 --> 01:12:32.079
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.

474
01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:35.919
- Can you suggest a last line?
- I'm not a writer.

475
01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:41.199
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

476
01:12:43.639 --> 01:12:45.799
What else has she told you?

477
01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:49.719
You have nightmares.

478
01:12:52.559 --> 01:12:54.039
Every soldier has nightmares.

479
01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:57.719
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

480
01:12:58.479 --> 01:13:01.719
You have no idea what I have done.

481
01:13:08.959 --> 01:13:12.119
You have seen many things.

482
01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:14.159
I have.

483
01:13:14.359 --> 01:13:18.599
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

484
01:13:19.119 --> 01:13:21.159
Is this not so?

485
01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:26.279
- Yes.
- I, also.

486
01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:31.279
It happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

487
01:13:31.799 --> 01:13:37.279
And then I come to this place
of my ancestors...

488
01:13:37.559 --> 01:13:39.559
and I remember.

489
01:13:39.759 --> 01:13:42.039
Like these blossoms...

490
01:13:42.799 --> 01:13:44.799
we are all dying.

491
01:13:46.679 --> 01:13:50.159
To know life in every breath...

492
01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:53.119
every cup of tea

493
01:13:53.279 --> 01:13:56.319
every life we take.

494
01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:58.879
The way of the warrior.

495
01:13:59.039 --> 01:14:01.239
Life in every breath.

496
01:14:02.319 --> 01:14:04.559
That is Bushido.

497
01:14:08.879 --> 01:14:12.519
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

498
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.199
We leave tomorrow.

499
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.519
Good.

500
01:14:20.639 --> 01:14:21.959
Good.

501
01:14:28.519 --> 01:14:31.519
When I took these, you were...

502
01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:33.959
my enemy.

503
01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:21.119
Algren-san! Algren-san.

504
01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:16.999
Algren?

505
01:19:17.199 --> 01:19:20.119
Algren, my God, you are alive.

506
01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:26.679
Well, you never cease to astonish.

507
01:19:27.359 --> 01:19:31.119
- Howitzers.
- Yes, indeed.

508
01:19:31.279 --> 01:19:34.079
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement

509
01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:36.319
he gets the whole package.

510
01:19:36.519 --> 01:19:40.039
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

511
01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:43.679
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

512
01:19:43.839 --> 01:19:45.559
I need a bath.

513
01:19:45.759 --> 01:19:49.359
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.

514
01:19:50.879 --> 01:19:53.119
Welcome back, captain.

515
01:21:23.999 --> 01:21:26.559
Gentlemen, come in.

516
01:21:27.079 --> 01:21:31.759
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured
your captivity with little ill effect.

517
01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.239
I was not ill-treated, sir.

518
01:21:34.439 --> 01:21:37.999
Mr. Omura, I have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

519
01:21:38.199 --> 01:21:41.999
I'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

520
01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:43.599
I'm afraid I don't know.

521
01:21:43.759 --> 01:21:47.119
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.

522
01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:51.519
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

523
01:21:51.719 --> 01:21:57.039
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

524
01:21:57.199 --> 01:22:01.159
- Sir, about the...
- I'm sure your documents are in order.

525
01:22:01.359 --> 01:22:05.799
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.

526
01:22:05.959 --> 01:22:10.319
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

527
01:22:10.479 --> 01:22:12.999
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

528
01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:15.559
With all due respect, ambassador

529
01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:18.479
perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

530
01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:21.399
For instance, the French or the English.

531
01:22:21.559 --> 01:22:24.679
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

532
01:22:26.439 --> 01:22:29.719
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

533
01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:34.119
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

534
01:22:34.599 --> 01:22:39.399
Perhaps you and I might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

535
01:22:42.439 --> 01:22:45.759
- May I offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.

536
01:22:52.079 --> 01:22:55.239
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

537
01:22:55.399 --> 01:22:59.119
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.

538
01:22:59.279 --> 01:23:04.239
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

539
01:23:04.399 --> 01:23:08.319
- I don't see how this concerns me.
- But it does.

540
01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:13.719
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

541
01:23:13.879 --> 01:23:16.519
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

542
01:23:16.679 --> 01:23:18.639
But now, we are ready.

543
01:23:18.799 --> 01:23:22.239
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause

544
01:23:22.399 --> 01:23:27.239
we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.

545
01:23:27.399 --> 01:23:32.959
Either I'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

546
01:23:33.159 --> 01:23:37.279
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

547
01:23:39.079 --> 01:23:42.599
- I appreciate the offer.
- It is not an offer.

548
01:23:43.399 --> 01:23:47.439
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

549
01:23:47.639 --> 01:23:50.119
Then we will make a new contract

550
01:23:50.279 --> 01:23:55.479
one that will recognize the extraordinary
contribution you've made to the Emperor.

551
01:23:55.999 --> 01:23:58.279
Do we understand each other?

552
01:24:00.879 --> 01:24:04.799
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then I am pleased.

553
01:24:22.959 --> 01:24:25.799
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

554
01:24:25.959 --> 01:24:27.959
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

555
01:24:28.119 --> 01:24:30.879
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

556
01:24:31.039 --> 01:24:32.239
I need a drink.

557
01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:37.479
Is your friend Katsumoto really planning to
go up against the council this afternoon?

558
01:24:43.999 --> 01:24:45.159
My God, it's started.

559
01:24:56.119 --> 01:24:57.159
Captain Algren!

560
01:26:11.039 --> 01:26:12.679
Jolly good.

561
01:29:04.199 --> 01:29:06.199
I heard you were leaving.

562
01:29:07.999 --> 01:29:11.039
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

563
01:29:12.119 --> 01:29:14.319
I suppose I should thank you.

564
01:29:14.879 --> 01:29:19.399
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent...

565
01:29:19.839 --> 01:29:21.679
...in captivity.

566
01:29:23.239 --> 01:29:26.559
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

567
01:29:30.039 --> 01:29:31.479
You're welcome.

568
01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:39.199
Well, it is pretty much over.

569
01:29:39.359 --> 01:29:43.759
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

570
01:29:43.919 --> 01:29:48.279
With him dead, we should have
little trouble handling the rebellion

571
01:29:48.439 --> 01:29:50.159
even without you.

572
01:29:54.559 --> 01:29:56.879
Especially without you.

573
01:30:01.839 --> 01:30:04.039
Just tell me one thing.

574
01:30:04.679 --> 01:30:08.919
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

575
01:34:24.679 --> 01:34:27.359
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

576
01:35:12.919 --> 01:35:15.999
- President of the United States?
- Sorry.

577
01:35:16.159 --> 01:35:17.959
I think I'm going to be sick.

578
01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:38.239
How's your poem coming?

579
01:35:40.919 --> 01:35:43.759
The end is proving difficult.

580
01:35:43.919 --> 01:35:47.879
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

581
01:35:49.359 --> 01:35:51.519
I thought you returned to America.

582
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:56.399
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.

583
01:35:56.639 --> 01:35:58.759
How do you plan to do that?

584
01:36:07.599 --> 01:36:11.599
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

585
01:36:11.759 --> 01:36:13.959
I would be greatly honored.

586
01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:15.359
The Emperor could not hear my words.

587
01:40:17.719 --> 01:40:20.199
His army will come.

588
01:40:21.479 --> 01:40:23.399
It is the end.

589
01:40:25.879 --> 01:40:30.399
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

590
01:40:32.079 --> 01:40:34.359
Now

591
01:40:34.519 --> 01:40:36.239
I have failed them.

592
01:40:47.759 --> 01:40:51.159
So you will take your own life...

593
01:40:52.759 --> 01:40:53.999
in shame?

594
01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:02.839
Shame for a life of service?

595
01:41:03.839 --> 01:41:06.639
Discipline? Compassion?

596
01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:10.919
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

597
01:41:11.079 --> 01:41:13.519
Necessary?

598
01:41:15.519 --> 01:41:18.039
What could be more necessary?

599
01:41:22.119 --> 01:41:25.679
I will die by the sword.

600
01:41:27.399 --> 01:41:29.799
My own,

601
01:41:29.999 --> 01:41:31.799
or my enemy's.

602
01:41:32.999 --> 01:41:35.119
Then let it be your enemy's.

603
01:41:38.719 --> 01:41:42.519
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

604
01:44:23.759 --> 01:44:25.639
Algren.

605
01:44:56.399 --> 01:44:58.479
I'd say two full regiments.

606
01:44:58.639 --> 01:45:00.919
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

607
01:45:01.479 --> 01:45:03.119
And they have the howitzers.

608
01:45:03.279 --> 01:45:07.519
It makes no difference. They will come,
and we will make our stand.

609
01:45:07.719 --> 01:45:10.719
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.

610
01:45:11.319 --> 01:45:13.119
Like General Custer, huh?

611
01:45:17.439 --> 01:45:21.479
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

612
01:45:21.639 --> 01:45:25.199
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

613
01:45:25.399 --> 01:45:27.959
A million. You understand this number?

614
01:45:28.159 --> 01:45:30.159
I understand this number.

615
01:45:30.399 --> 01:45:32.999
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly

616
01:45:33.159 --> 01:45:38.479
the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

617
01:45:38.679 --> 01:45:42.799
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.

618
01:45:43.039 --> 01:45:46.519
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.

619
01:45:47.719 --> 01:45:49.279
Close enough for a sword.

620
01:45:50.999 --> 01:45:53.279
You believe

621
01:45:53.439 --> 01:45:55.559
a man can change his destiny?

622
01:45:58.479 --> 01:46:01.639
I think a man does what he can

623
01:46:01.839 --> 01:46:03.959
until his destiny is revealed to him.

624
01:46:11.359 --> 01:46:15.039
<i>May 25th, 1877.</i>

625
01:46:15.199 --> 01:46:18.319
<i>This will be the last entry
in this journal.</i>

626
01:46:18.519 --> 01:46:23.719
<i>I've tried to give a true accounting
of what I have seen, what I have done.</i>

627
01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:27.479
<i>I do not presume to understand
the course of my life.</i>

628
01:46:27.799 --> 01:46:31.879
<i>I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this</i>

629
01:46:32.039 --> 01:46:34.079
<i>even if for a moment.</i>

630
01:51:49.919 --> 01:51:52.799
You will need this.

631
01:52:04.679 --> 01:52:05.959
What does it say?

632
01:52:07.039 --> 01:52:12.519
"I belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new."

633
01:53:16.559 --> 01:53:19.039
Good God.

634
01:53:22.599 --> 01:53:26.639
Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

635
01:53:27.119 --> 01:53:29.679
If you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

636
01:53:30.039 --> 01:53:34.559
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

637
01:53:38.759 --> 01:53:40.679
Captain Algren.

638
01:53:40.839 --> 01:53:42.759
We will show you no quarter.

639
01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:45.559
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

640
01:53:46.599 --> 01:53:48.599
I'll look for you on the field.

641
01:54:09.399 --> 01:54:10.879
Captain Algren.

642
01:54:11.039 --> 01:54:13.639
Mr. Graham.

643
01:54:16.959 --> 01:54:20.319
Perhaps you can use these for your book.

644
01:54:20.479 --> 01:54:22.919
Yes, I will. Captain.

645
01:54:26.079 --> 01:54:27.839
Godspeed.

646
01:54:29.479 --> 01:54:31.839
Mr. Graham.

647
01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:57.519
Commence firing!

648
01:57:13.399 --> 01:57:15.959
- They're covering their retreat.
- You see?

649
01:57:16.119 --> 01:57:19.879
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

650
01:57:20.079 --> 01:57:23.279
- Signal the attack.
- I advise sending in skirmishers first.

651
01:57:23.439 --> 01:57:25.439
Nonsense! Full attack!

652
01:58:21.159 --> 01:58:23.399
They're coming.

653
01:58:55.759 --> 01:58:57.679
Wait for the volley.

654
01:59:09.439 --> 01:59:11.279
Second volley.

655
02:00:06.079 --> 02:00:08.319
- What on earth?
- What is happening?

656
02:00:53.159 --> 02:00:56.479
- The attack has been stopped.
- Send in the rest of the regiment.

657
02:01:01.439 --> 02:01:03.719
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

658
02:01:04.119 --> 02:01:06.879
Dead to the last man.

659
02:02:09.959 --> 02:02:11.719
Algren-san!

660
02:05:00.239 --> 02:05:03.039
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

661
02:06:07.279 --> 02:06:11.199
They'll bring two more regiments
up here soon.

662
02:06:11.359 --> 02:06:13.439
We won't be able to stop them again.

663
02:06:14.439 --> 02:06:16.479
You do not have to die here.

664
02:06:19.519 --> 02:06:22.319
I should have died so many times before.

665
02:06:22.839 --> 02:06:24.279
Now, you live again.

666
02:06:27.519 --> 02:06:29.719
Yes.

667
02:06:31.879 --> 02:06:34.839
It was not your time.

668
02:06:38.239 --> 02:06:40.519
It's not over.

669
02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:28.239
What is this?

670
02:07:32.519 --> 02:07:36.839
- This is madness. He's going to attack?
- Yes.

671
02:07:45.119 --> 02:07:48.199
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

672
02:08:00.159 --> 02:08:02.559
Kill him. All of them.

673
02:08:02.759 --> 02:08:05.159
Now!

674
02:08:09.199 --> 02:08:10.559
My horse!

675
02:09:03.479 --> 02:09:04.719
Fire!

676
02:09:41.759 --> 02:09:43.119
Ready!

677
02:09:46.479 --> 02:09:47.759
Aim!

678
02:09:53.079 --> 02:09:54.439
Fire!

679
02:10:00.599 --> 02:10:02.079
Fire at will!

680
02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:02.479
Backward!

681
02:13:12.479 --> 02:13:13.919
No.

682
02:13:21.039 --> 02:13:23.759
You have your honor again.

683
02:13:25.959 --> 02:13:28.239
Let me die with mine.

684
02:13:37.639 --> 02:13:39.679
Help me up.

685
02:13:59.279 --> 02:14:00.959
Are you ready?

686
02:14:08.119 --> 02:14:11.759
I will miss our conversations.

687
02:14:58.319 --> 02:15:00.639
Perfect.

688
02:15:07.279 --> 02:15:10.479
They are all...

689
02:15:11.479 --> 02:15:13.599
perfect.

690
02:16:41.679 --> 02:16:45.319
<i>On behalf of the United
States of America...</i>

691
02:16:46.279 --> 02:16:51.479
the signing of this treaty will usher
in an era of unprecedented prosperity,

692
02:16:51.679 --> 02:16:55.799
and cooperation between
our two great nations.

693
02:16:56.159 --> 02:16:57.879
On behalf of the Emperor

694
02:16:58.039 --> 02:17:01.799
we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this...

695
02:17:05.199 --> 02:17:07.479
negotiation.

696
02:18:51.679 --> 02:18:54.519
This is Katsumoto's sword.

697
02:18:55.879 --> 02:18:58.559
He would have wanted you to have it...

698
02:18:59.719 --> 02:19:02.799
that the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

699
02:19:08.879 --> 02:19:10.439
He hoped...

700
02:19:11.079 --> 02:19:13.279
with his last breath...

701
02:19:13.679 --> 02:19:17.039
that you would remember the ancestors
who held this sword...

702
02:19:18.799 --> 02:19:21.119
and what they died for.

703
02:19:41.319 --> 02:19:43.559
You were with him...

704
02:19:44.759 --> 02:19:46.799
at the end?

705
02:19:52.199 --> 02:19:55.639
Emperor, this man fought against you!

706
02:19:59.839 --> 02:20:01.479
Your Highness...

707
02:20:02.759 --> 02:20:07.319
if you believe me to be your enemy,
command me,

708
02:20:07.479 --> 02:20:09.799
and I will gladly take my life.

709
02:20:23.959 --> 02:20:27.999
I have dreamed of a unified Japan

710
02:20:28.199 --> 02:20:33.999
of a country strong
and independent and modern.

711
02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:39.959
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

712
02:20:41.919 --> 02:20:43.519
But...

713
02:20:46.919 --> 02:20:50.959
we cannot forget who we are...

714
02:20:52.399 --> 02:20:56.919
or where we come from.

715
02:21:09.319 --> 02:21:11.879
Ambassador Swanbeck

716
02:21:12.079 --> 02:21:14.879
I have concluded that your treaty

717
02:21:15.079 --> 02:21:19.919
is not in the best interest of my people.

718
02:21:20.679 --> 02:21:24.319
- Sir, if I may...
- So sorry...

719
02:21:24.679 --> 02:21:26.439
but you may not.

720
02:21:26.759 --> 02:21:30.119
This is an outrage!

721
02:22:36.719 --> 02:22:39.239
Tell me how he died.

722
02:22:46.999 --> 02:22:51.559
I will tell you how he lived.

723
02:23:00.799 --> 02:23:05.239
<i>And so the days of the Samurai had ended.</i>

724
02:23:05.399 --> 02:23:10.919
<i>Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.</i>

725
02:23:11.999 --> 02:23:14.599
<i>As for the American captain</i>

726
02:23:14.799 --> 02:23:17.119
<i>no one knows what became of him.</i>

727
02:23:17.279 --> 02:23:20.719
<i>Some say that he died of his wounds</i>

728
02:23:20.879 --> 02:23:24.839
<i>others, that he returned
to his own country.</i>

729
02:23:25.039 --> 02:23:26.639
<i>But I like to think</i>

730
02:23:26.839 --> 02:23:31.879
<i>he may have at last found
some small measure of peace</i>

731
02:23:32.079 --> 02:23:34.079
<i>that we all seek...</i>

732
02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:37.999
<i>and few of us ever find.</i>
