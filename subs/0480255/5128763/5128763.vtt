00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.993
Sorry, l just can't give you
that kind of information.

2
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.661
L'll do anything else.
L just can't do that.

3
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.866
L can't betray my country. l won't.

4
00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:35.773
This country gave me everything.

5
00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:38.540
Oh, God. Just keep him away from me.

6
00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:41.081
Please. Don't let him near me.

7
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:43.412
Oh, no! Oh, God!

8
00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:46.988
Come on, baby. Just relax into it.
Let Godzilla do his thing.

9
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:50.986
Come on. This is wrong
on so many levels. You in or not?

10
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:52.287
And get cheated again?

11
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.424
What? No. the Pooch may lie.
The Pooch may steal. the Pooch may...

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.297
- Refer to himself in the third person?
- Occasionally. But the Pooch won't cheat.

13
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.064
Well. the Pooch can relax.
I was worried about Cougar.

14
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.299
Yeah. right. It's always the quiet ones.

15
00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:09.206
What? It's Blind Man's Bluff.
High card wins.

16
00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:11.040
How in the hell can a man cheat you?

17
00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.343
Cards.

18
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.516
Feel like I got something here.
I got something.

19
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.124
Queen. king. jack. Queen. king. jack.
AII right.

20
00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:24.226
One. two. three. go.

21
00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:38.306
I got a great. great feeling
about this one.

22
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.310
- Your mama had a great feeling last night.
- Oh. that was a mama joke.

23
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.282
What? AII right.

24
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.817
- AII right. Iet's go.
- Okay. it's a game.

25
00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:52.353
AII right. I will raise you.

26
00:01:54.124 --> 00:01:55.682
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh. no?

27
00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.123
- Got this piece off that Honduran general?
- Yes.

28
00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:02.256
Guess what? I'm definitely in.

29
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.268
- Let's go.
- AII right.

30
00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:07.460
Whoa!

31
00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.074
- Dhould even me up.
- How many do you have?

32
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:12.435
What is going on here?

33
00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.008
Coug. it's your bet.

34
00:02:14.277 --> 00:02:15.608
Hey. Iosers!

35
00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:18.938
It's time.

36
00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:37.124
We got a drug and arms dealer
named Fadhil...

37
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.168
running a homegrown terrorist assembly
line out by the Madre de Dios River basin.

38
00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:45.808
We find it. we paint it for a laser-targeted bomb.
We get the hell out.

39
00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:47.238
No muss. no fuss.

40
00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:49.075
For that. they need us?

41
00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:51.908
You'd rather take on 50 dudes
with AK's?

42
00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:09.360
AII right. I got eyes on Monsieur Fadhil.

43
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.433
- Paint it.
- Dhowtime. fellas.

44
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.502
Go ahead and call me Michelangelo.

45
00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:18.234
Dropkick. this is Pinball.
Request fire mission.

46
00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:22.105
The target is lased. and you are clear
to make a run from north to south. Over.

47
00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.177
Roger. Pinball.
Target acquired and locked.

48
00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:28.875
Be advised. ETA fireworks.
Zero eight Mikes.

49
00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.883
Roger. we'II break out the earplugs.

50
00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:39.590
Boss?

51
00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:44.864
They're using kids as mules.

52
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:49.697
- Call it in.
- We have children at target site.

53
00:03:49.873 --> 00:03:52.933
Repeat. we have eyes on children
at target site. Please advise.

54
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.577
Acknowledged. Maintain position.

55
00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:56.975
Maintain position?
What is he talking about?

56
00:03:57.147 --> 00:03:59.672
We strongly recommend cancellation
of payload delivery.

57
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.482
Your orders stand. Prep for extraction.

58
00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:05.712
Cougar.

59
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:09.952
Dropkick. this is Pinball.

60
00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.459
Equipment has suffered
catastrophic system failure.

61
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.995
Am calling an on-site abort.

62
00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.599
Well, that was just stupid.

63
00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:21.002
Is this Mission Controller?

64
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:22.763
This is Max, Colonel Clay.

65
00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:26.700
No one uses names on comms.
This is a secure military channel.

66
00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:28.969
- Really?
- Goddamn it. Iisten to me.

67
00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:30.875
There are children on site.

68
00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:32.878
And you think l didn't know that?

69
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:35.750
We locked coordinates
the moment you painted.

70
00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.580
Delivery will occur on schedule.

71
00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:39.287
- Have a super day.
- You can't...

72
00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:42.550
Dhit! Jensen. contact the plane directly.
Call an abort.

73
00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:45.593
I'm trying. He's jamming us.
There's nothing I can do.

74
00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:49.695
There's something we can do.

75
00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:52.130
AII right. here it is.
Five against the fortress.

76
00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:56.329
We got maybe. what. eight minutes before
an airstrike sets the world on fire.

77
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.134
Plenty of time.

78
00:04:58.341 --> 00:04:59.433
I'II drive.

79
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.829
Us against 50 dudes with AK's. huh?

80
00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:41.078
Jensen. Pooch. get a truck for the kids.
Rest. out in five.

81
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.745
- Airstrike in four and change. Iadies!
- Be out in four. Rally point. On me.

82
00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:48.115
Three minutes to target.

83
00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:03.704
Come on. Iet's go!
Out you go. Come on. kids.

84
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.045
- Okay. you go over here with him.
- Come on. mama. Come on.

85
00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:13.381
I got this. Get them out.

86
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.986
AII right. who's your papi? Let's go
this way. Let's go. Come on. Iet's go.

87
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.089
Ah.

88
00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:23.991
- No.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.286
- Really?
- Why not?

90
00:06:25.462 --> 00:06:26.895
- Can you?
- Of course.

91
00:06:27.063 --> 00:06:28.621
Okay.

92
00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.504
Ladies.

93
00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:41.908
Up you get. Up you get.

94
00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:46.438
Clay, we got
the kids. Rally point, two minutes.

95
00:06:52.222 --> 00:06:53.553
Max sent you. didn't he?

96
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.151
I won't commit to his plan. he does this.

97
00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.197
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
You let him go. I let you live.

98
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:08.099
Come here. son.
Come here. son. Walk to me.

99
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.471
Attaboy.

100
00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:14.610
Clay, get the hell out. We gotta go, now.

101
00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:16.245
He'II kill you too. you know.

102
00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:25.821
Target is locked. T minus 20 seconds.

103
00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:29.488
Oh. you stop for coffee in there?

104
00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:38.364
What kind of blast radius
we looking at?

105
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.300
Okay. Pooch. I need you
to make this bus go a little faster.

106
00:07:43.473 --> 00:07:45.737
- Everybody. hold on to something.
- Like right now!

107
00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:15.200
I got it. I got it!

108
00:08:15.372 --> 00:08:16.566
There we go. Pooch!

109
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:23.105
Whew.

110
00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:31.215
Pinball, this is Chopper 3.
Prepare for extraction.

111
00:08:33.189 --> 00:08:36.283
My favorite part was
when we were completely on fire.

112
00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:38.654
But the shootout. that was good times.

113
00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:44.566
There she blows.

114
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:46.125
Well done.

115
00:08:46.302 --> 00:08:47.564
Let's go. Iet's go.

116
00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:50.570
- AII right. everyone together.
- Come on. Iet's go.

117
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.173
There you go. Good job.

118
00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:56.439
Dir. there's not enough room
for your team and them.

119
00:08:57.414 --> 00:08:59.006
Then it's them.

120
00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:01.983
- Let's go. guys.
- AII right. here we go.

121
00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:05.146
Watch your heads.

122
00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:16.765
You keep your bear.
You keep him safe. Okay?

123
00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:20.830
Adios. Get them out of here.

124
00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:38.549
Those are some cute little buggers.
Hope they make it to the court martial.

125
00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:40.716
What is that? You hear that?

126
00:09:44.094 --> 00:09:46.392
Guys. this is bad.

127
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.761
Max, Cobra One, Bandit locked.

128
00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:51.094
Understood.

129
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:54.868
Cobra One, kill Bandit.

130
00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.798
No!

131
00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:47.251
That's supposed to be us.

132
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:52.249
Protests today in front of
the American Embassy, a violent response...

133
00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:55.591
to the deaths of 25 Bolivian children
killed during the operation.

134
00:10:55.765 --> 00:10:57.892
Let me be perfectly clear.

135
00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:03.300
In no way were these men acting
under orders from the U.D. government.

136
00:11:08.878 --> 00:11:11.278
Is there gonna be some kind
of ceremony for them?

137
00:11:16.953 --> 00:11:18.011
Where's the ring?

138
00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:01.757
L love you, Mommy. You're so pretty.

139
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:05.391
L love you, Mommy.

140
00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:30.818
What are you doing? No. no. no!

141
00:12:31.227 --> 00:12:34.458
- Jeez. He's gonna get murdered.
- Come on. come on. come on.

142
00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:45.201
This is disgusting.
AII right. I'm officially disgusted by us.

143
00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:47.639
- And you lost again.
- We lost again.

144
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.210
- No. you put the bet down.
- You gave me the money.

145
00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:53.475
Yeah. and that was stupid of me.
Wasn't it?

146
00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:59.083
I mean. could this get any more sleazy?

147
00:13:03.693 --> 00:13:05.854
I suppose if we started drinking.

148
00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:07.621
You're not...? You're not drinking?

149
00:13:12.902 --> 00:13:14.267
Come on. get him in there!

150
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:25.905
Thank you.

151
00:13:31.654 --> 00:13:34.714
I found a guy online who says
he can trade intel on Max for cash.

152
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:37.792
- AII we gotta do is make a little money.
- We don't have money.

153
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.260
We're gonna go PayPal-ing some kid
in a basement who's most likely lying?

154
00:13:42.432 --> 00:13:44.696
You were there.
You know the man tried to kill us.

155
00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:47.267
The man did kill us. Clay.

156
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:52.773
No. we gotta stay focused. AII right?
On the mission.

157
00:13:52.942 --> 00:13:58.073
Get money. get clean passports. get back
to stateside without anybody noticing.

158
00:13:58.247 --> 00:14:00.909
- Didn't even see what he looks like.
- We heard his voice.

159
00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:03.382
A man with a voice
is a man with a throat.

160
00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:05.487
Come on. Clay. just look around you.

161
00:14:05.655 --> 00:14:09.887
Do you think we're in a position
to actually take on some CIA super spook?

162
00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:11.458
- Roque.
- It's a hell of a plan.

163
00:14:11.627 --> 00:14:14.619
You know what? Pooch can set up
over there by the taco stand.

164
00:14:14.797 --> 00:14:17.561
Jensen can set up communications
right there by the hookers.

165
00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:19.531
- Captain.
- Yo! Yo.

166
00:14:19.702 --> 00:14:22.603
You're not a soldier anymore.

167
00:14:23.272 --> 00:14:25.672
You're not a soldier. AII right?

168
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.745
Clay. for chrissakes.
You're losing the men.

169
00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:36.917
- The men are fine.
- Yeah. well. you're losing me. AII right?

170
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.153
He won. we lost. Just get us home.

171
00:14:44.527 --> 00:14:46.188
Can you do that?

172
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.195
How's your steak?

173
00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.532
Meaty.

174
00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:04.034
You want a bite?

175
00:16:06.142 --> 00:16:08.042
Maybe later.

176
00:16:10.346 --> 00:16:12.211
Okay.

177
00:16:22.058 --> 00:16:23.548
Do I know you?

178
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.019
Relax. Papi.

179
00:16:29.765 --> 00:16:31.562
Do I not look relaxed?

180
00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:34.226
No.

181
00:16:39.575 --> 00:16:41.543
Think we can change that?

182
00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:51.580
Wow. it's everything a girl can dream of.

183
00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:56.616
Do you have a bathroom?

184
00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:59.727
No. I specifically requested
the only hotel room in the world...

185
00:16:59.896 --> 00:17:01.363
that doesn't have a bathroom.

186
00:17:01.931 --> 00:17:04.991
Are you trying to turn a yes into a no?

187
00:17:05.668 --> 00:17:07.761
Oh. Thank you.

188
00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:18.844
Do. what brings you to Bolivia?

189
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.973
Cruise ship.

190
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.414
We're a landlocked country.

191
00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:25.850
Well. it's an amazing cruise ship.

192
00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:33.527
Where were we now?

193
00:17:36.632 --> 00:17:38.793
Well. I think you were about to tell me...

194
00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:41.196
how you enjoy following me.

195
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.134
You saw me. didn't you?

196
00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:45.399
I did.

197
00:17:46.976 --> 00:17:49.467
I bet you didn't see me
on Mercado Dtreet.

198
00:17:54.917 --> 00:17:56.976
I have a business proposition
for you. Clay.

199
00:17:57.153 --> 00:17:59.485
Oops. What happened to your accent?

200
00:18:00.623 --> 00:18:01.715
Oops.

201
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:08.189
I don't wanna hurt you.

202
00:18:08.364 --> 00:18:10.889
- You're not going to.
- Oh. yes. I am.

203
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:18.359
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:19:41.957 --> 00:19:43.185
What do you want?

205
00:19:43.693 --> 00:19:45.183
I can help you find Max.

206
00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:48.493
I'm listening.

207
00:20:00.876 --> 00:20:02.343
How did you know we were alive?

208
00:20:02.511 --> 00:20:04.979
I counted the number of teeth
in the chopper wreckage.

209
00:20:05.948 --> 00:20:08.416
Plus you guys aren't exactly subtle.

210
00:20:09.285 --> 00:20:12.880
Here's the deal.
I get you and your men back in the Dtates.

211
00:20:13.055 --> 00:20:14.920
In exchange. you get Max for me.

212
00:20:15.091 --> 00:20:18.288
- What's the catch. Iady?
- It's pretty much a suicide mission.

213
00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:22.156
Why should I trust you?

214
00:20:22.898 --> 00:20:26.527
Because if I were lying. I wouldn't have
used the words "suicide mission."

215
00:20:30.906 --> 00:20:33.272
Just meet me here tomorrow.

216
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.335
And bring your boys.

217
00:20:36.512 --> 00:20:38.537
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

218
00:20:42.017 --> 00:20:45.544
If you're lying to me. I'II kill you.

219
00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:48.284
It was nice meeting you too.

220
00:20:48.624 --> 00:20:50.683
Yes. it was.

221
00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:13.179
I'm sorry we're late.
There was a party at the doll factory.

222
00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:14.810
It was Pepito's birthday.

223
00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:16.609
- Really?
- Yeah.

224
00:21:22.424 --> 00:21:25.257
Do she wanted to meet in a cemetery.

225
00:21:25.427 --> 00:21:28.089
Because that's not.
Iike. foreboding at all.

226
00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:31.031
- Am I the only one that sees this shirt?
- No.

227
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:33.868
Oh. it's my niece's soccer team.

228
00:21:34.036 --> 00:21:37.528
Eight and under.
I checked their scores online and I...

229
00:21:38.307 --> 00:21:39.774
What?

230
00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:42.606
They're in the playoffs.

231
00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:45.040
What do you have on her?

232
00:21:45.414 --> 00:21:47.439
Besides a pant-busting crush?

233
00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:50.014
Her company file is blank.

234
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:54.816
CIA has a standing kill order on her.
As does Hamas. Dinn Fein.

235
00:21:55.024 --> 00:21:58.516
Pretty much everyone with the exception of
PETA wants this chick amscrayed.

236
00:21:59.695 --> 00:22:03.688
You thinking clear on this? Because every
time you mess up. it's because of a woman.

237
00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:05.424
- Name one time that I...
- Amber.

238
00:22:05.634 --> 00:22:09.126
- Amber's husband was the problem.
- Her husband wasn't the one who shot you.

239
00:22:09.305 --> 00:22:10.897
- Only in the leg.
- What about Emma?

240
00:22:11.073 --> 00:22:14.839
- Doesn't count. I didn't sleep with Emma.
- Because she put a bomb in your car!

241
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.537
I admit. that did take a little of
the romance out of the relationship.

242
00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:22.047
Yeah. And now this chick shows up and...
What's her name. Aisha?

243
00:22:22.218 --> 00:22:25.710
And well. she burns down our hotel.

244
00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:27.150
I'm clear. Roque.

245
00:22:27.323 --> 00:22:30.588
Well. you better be.
Because I ain't getting killed by no girl.

246
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:33.489
It's been a long time
since anyone called me a girl.

247
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.161
Dhe put a bomb in your car?

248
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:41.461
Dhe was volatile.

249
00:22:42.137 --> 00:22:46.506
Aisha. this is Jensen.
Pooch. Roque. Cougar.

250
00:22:47.276 --> 00:22:48.436
Really? Heh.

251
00:22:51.347 --> 00:22:55.909
Gentlemen. in 97 hours.
Max will be in Miami.

252
00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:59.248
He travels in an armored column
with at least 30 private security...

253
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:01.082
armed to the teeth.

254
00:23:01.257 --> 00:23:03.885
You have a better shot
at kidnapping the president.

255
00:23:05.628 --> 00:23:09.496
Good news for you is I have the power
to get you guys back in the U.D...

256
00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:12.395
and fund the entire op as you see fit.

257
00:23:12.568 --> 00:23:14.559
You get Max and we're square.

258
00:23:14.737 --> 00:23:17.672
And why should we believe you?

259
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:22.433
Because I'm the first person you've met
who even admits he exists.

260
00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:27.039
Listen. you guys can all stay here
in Bolivia and rot.

261
00:23:27.216 --> 00:23:30.185
Or you can go home and get revenge
on the man that framed you.

262
00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:32.210
It's your choice.

263
00:23:33.055 --> 00:23:34.352
Colonel?

264
00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:37.319
Don't call me that.
We're not soldiers anymore.

265
00:23:37.493 --> 00:23:39.290
Okay. you know that if we do this...

266
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:42.624
we are waging a war
against the Central Intelligence Agency.

267
00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:45.929
They started it.

268
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:56.710
Okay. here's what I'm hearing.

269
00:23:56.879 --> 00:24:01.339
I'm hearing. "No." I'm hearing.
"Leave." I'm hearing. "I'm sorry."

270
00:24:01.517 --> 00:24:05.146
- Is that what I'm hearing?
- We cannot do what you ask. I'm sorry!

271
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:08.813
Tell me. Nabil. is this a moral issue
or a financial issue?

272
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:10.083
- A moral issue.
- Really?

273
00:24:10.526 --> 00:24:12.858
You morally object to this deal?

274
00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:16.862
- Yes. I'm sorry. Please. Ieave.
- Okay. so that is what I'm hearing.

275
00:24:17.032 --> 00:24:20.024
Now I want you to listen to me.
Iisten carefully...

276
00:24:20.202 --> 00:24:21.863
because I want you to hear this.

277
00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:23.600
Wade?

278
00:24:28.344 --> 00:24:30.073
What is this? What are you doing?

279
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.645
No. please!

280
00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:45.622
What the hell was that?

281
00:24:46.095 --> 00:24:47.619
You gave me the nod.

282
00:24:47.796 --> 00:24:51.027
A hit-him-in-the-face nod.
Not a throw-him-off-the-roof nod.

283
00:24:53.302 --> 00:24:55.463
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- At most...

284
00:24:55.637 --> 00:24:57.764
at most.
That was a break-his-fingers nod.

285
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.341
Jesus. Wade.
The man was a scientific genius.

286
00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:05.673
Granted. his weight signaled certain
impulse-control issues...

287
00:25:06.415 --> 00:25:10.408
but that's no reason
to throw his fat ass off 57 floors.

288
00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:12.246
Dorry.

289
00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:19.786
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say your actions were excessive.

290
00:25:19.962 --> 00:25:23.454
And yes. more than just a little wasteful.

291
00:25:26.402 --> 00:25:29.235
But then. it does seem
to have had the desired effect.

292
00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:32.568
- I'II tell you what. throw baldy off next.
- No. please. Wait.

293
00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:36.644
We have a different moral perspective
than our late colleague.

294
00:25:37.146 --> 00:25:39.546
I need one to test and four to use.

295
00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:41.273
Four snukes?

296
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.083
We would need much money.

297
00:25:46.455 --> 00:25:48.855
You will have much money.

298
00:26:29.898 --> 00:26:32.196
Welcome back to the land of the living.

299
00:26:37.406 --> 00:26:38.805
How do you wanna begin?

300
00:26:39.908 --> 00:26:41.899
We're gonna go bird hunting.

301
00:27:30.626 --> 00:27:34.221
It's a sonic de-materializer.
Better known as a snuke.

302
00:27:34.763 --> 00:27:37.561
For the 21st-century green terrorist.

303
00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.397
Pure destruction.

304
00:27:40.102 --> 00:27:41.763
No pollution.

305
00:27:46.475 --> 00:27:48.306
Do who are we selling them to?

306
00:27:49.244 --> 00:27:51.678
Chinese extremists. PLF.
The frigging French Basques.

307
00:27:51.847 --> 00:27:54.873
As long as they have the right price
and are willing to use it.

308
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.211
No stockpiling. no deterrence.

309
00:27:57.386 --> 00:28:00.446
It's like giving a handgun
to a 6-year-old. Wade.

310
00:28:00.622 --> 00:28:02.283
You don't know how it's gonna end...

311
00:28:02.457 --> 00:28:05.324
but you're pretty sure
it's gonna make the papers.

312
00:28:06.028 --> 00:28:07.052
Another war.

313
00:28:07.262 --> 00:28:09.730
Well. what do you believe in. Wade?

314
00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:12.890
I'm guessing shotguns and big titties.

315
00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:15.400
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

316
00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:20.937
We're saving the country...

317
00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:24.203
doing something for the benefit of
the United Dtates of America.

318
00:28:24.379 --> 00:28:26.347
I was born in Quebec.

319
00:28:26.848 --> 00:28:30.181
Okay. Then we're saving North America.

320
00:28:32.988 --> 00:28:35.320
Oops. Dorry.

321
00:28:39.228 --> 00:28:41.355
Let me have your weapon. Wade.

322
00:29:20.168 --> 00:29:22.363
Base 1. this is Cavalier 415!

323
00:29:22.537 --> 00:29:25.472
We've been in a collision
with a civilian vehicle.

324
00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:27.973
Carvey's dead
and Freeman's hurt real bad.

325
00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:30.373
We need medevac immediately.

326
00:29:30.545 --> 00:29:32.604
He's got kids. Base 1. he's got kids!

327
00:29:34.249 --> 00:29:36.080
That sucked.

328
00:29:36.251 --> 00:29:39.186
- Roger, Cavalier 415.
- Come on. Jensen. You're better than that.

329
00:29:39.354 --> 00:29:42.084
- Scrambling a chopper. Hang in there.
- He's got kids.

330
00:29:42.257 --> 00:29:43.656
Do contrived.

331
00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:45.793
I used to be good at that. Right. Roque?

332
00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:47.359
- Dhut up.
- Thanks. man.

333
00:29:48.363 --> 00:29:49.694
Robert De Niro who?

334
00:29:49.898 --> 00:29:52.366
- Jensen. shut up.
- You shut up. Roque.

335
00:29:52.534 --> 00:29:55.731
You're dead. I'm spinal injury.
Dpinal injury can talk. Dead can't.

336
00:29:55.904 --> 00:29:57.963
Dtop talking or I'II
break your neck really.

337
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.506
You really gotta start getting
into character.

338
00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:03.372
I'm serious. man. Dead guy. no talking.

339
00:30:05.714 --> 00:30:06.806
AII right.

340
00:30:08.817 --> 00:30:13.311
Base 1. this is Medvac Delta.
We have visual on Cavalier 415.

341
00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:16.050
Here we go.

342
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.391
Buddy. we'II get you patched up
in no time.

343
00:30:27.569 --> 00:30:29.867
Oh. my God. Hi.

344
00:30:30.038 --> 00:30:31.403
What's your name?

345
00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:34.103
Fire when ready, Cougar.

346
00:30:35.477 --> 00:30:36.876
Ow.

347
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.908
- Oh. shit.
- What the hell's going on?

348
00:30:49.257 --> 00:30:50.656
Woo-hoo.

349
00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:55.995
You've just been chopper-jacked. fellas.

350
00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:05.901
Where's my wild goose?

351
00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:08.042
The GPD?

352
00:31:09.144 --> 00:31:10.577
Got it!

353
00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:17.244
Have you ever seen an EMT
look like this?

354
00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:19.444
Really. bro? "Hi. what's your name?

355
00:31:19.621 --> 00:31:21.541
I have no legs.
But I wanna take you on a date"?

356
00:31:24.393 --> 00:31:25.724
Yo. J.

357
00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:29.729
What do you think is up with all this
"Don't call me colonel" stuff?

358
00:31:29.898 --> 00:31:31.798
It's classic loss of identity.

359
00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:34.629
Clay defined himself by his place
in military structure...

360
00:31:34.803 --> 00:31:36.794
his way of measuring the good he did.

361
00:31:36.972 --> 00:31:40.931
Without it. he's just another loser
like the rest of us.

362
00:31:41.476 --> 00:31:43.910
You know cats can make
a thousand different sounds...

363
00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:45.569
and dogs can only make ten?

364
00:31:46.982 --> 00:31:51.544
Cats. Not to be trusted.

365
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.881
Okay. do me a favor
and never repeat that.

366
00:31:54.055 --> 00:31:55.716
Okay? We're all set.

367
00:31:58.727 --> 00:32:02.458
Ready to take a giant step for...

368
00:32:02.631 --> 00:32:04.963
guys who like to steal stuff. I guess.

369
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.698
- Hit it.
- Dhowtime.

370
00:32:12.073 --> 00:32:13.370
Beautiful.

371
00:32:14.643 --> 00:32:16.668
- Now. that's a rocket!
- Let them chase that.

372
00:32:16.878 --> 00:32:17.902
That is a rocket!

373
00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:19.341
- Wow. shit!
- Did you see that?

374
00:32:19.514 --> 00:32:21.072
Medevac Delta, this is Base 1.

375
00:32:21.249 --> 00:32:23.979
- Oh. my God.
- I'm the black MacGyver. BlaGyver.

376
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:26.518
- What's your situation? Over.
- Time to move.

377
00:32:59.287 --> 00:33:00.447
Hi.

378
00:33:06.962 --> 00:33:08.793
Where you from originally?

379
00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:12.096
The wilds of Northern Africa.

380
00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:14.899
Wow. so that must've been...

381
00:33:20.275 --> 00:33:22.573
sandy.

382
00:33:26.982 --> 00:33:28.643
Do you have any hobbies?

383
00:33:29.684 --> 00:33:32.517
When I was little. I collected human ears.

384
00:33:34.122 --> 00:33:35.521
Good times.

385
00:33:37.993 --> 00:33:39.085
But it's...

386
00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:53.100
No. no. no. my friend. Iisten.

387
00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:56.142
A gas turbine generator
running a force-fed rectifier unit.

388
00:33:56.344 --> 00:33:59.404
Hook it up to the fuel tank
and... we're in the game.

389
00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:03.244
There are few things in life that liberal
application of duct tape can't solve.

390
00:34:03.718 --> 00:34:05.948
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

391
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:08.516
It's taken care of. Thanks.

392
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:12.483
Which brings me to my question. Aisha.

393
00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:14.822
- What do you want with Max?
- Roque.

394
00:34:14.996 --> 00:34:16.987
No. Dhe did her part.

395
00:34:17.365 --> 00:34:18.832
AII right?

396
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.992
We got home.
I mean. we could walk right now.

397
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.365
- You can. but we made a deal.
- Fuck deals. okay?

398
00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:25.733
You made a deal with Clay.

399
00:34:28.176 --> 00:34:29.609
I want answers.

400
00:34:35.717 --> 00:34:39.118
Max is trying
to buy next-generation weapons.

401
00:34:39.287 --> 00:34:40.549
I don't know the endgame.

402
00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:44.952
What I do know is when Max takes
an interest in something. people die...

403
00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:46.525
and world maps get redrawn.

404
00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:50.062
Bullshit. Do you really think
you could take him on. Iittle girl?

405
00:34:50.231 --> 00:34:52.995
No. big boy. You are.

406
00:34:53.168 --> 00:34:55.728
I think I'm just gonna kill her
right now. Clay.

407
00:34:55.904 --> 00:34:58.395
- No. you're not.
- Yes. I am.

408
00:34:58.573 --> 00:35:02.304
I'm right here. You wanna shoot
your bankroll. go right ahead.

409
00:35:04.379 --> 00:35:05.573
Roque.

410
00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:08.178
Roque.

411
00:35:12.287 --> 00:35:15.120
Okay. you stay with us.
But if anything smells like a trap...

412
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.283
I get to put a bullet in your skull.
Does that sound fair?

413
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.019
That sounds fun.

414
00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:24.030
Dounds like my parents.

415
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.728
- I knew you weren't gonna shoot her.
- Not today.

416
00:35:35.477 --> 00:35:37.411
Douthwest perimeter secure.

417
00:35:43.418 --> 00:35:44.442
Load and go.

418
00:35:45.587 --> 00:35:48.215
That's the prize. That's where Max is.

419
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.451
Yeah. I sure hope he doesn't see us
in this bright yellow banana Pinto.

420
00:35:52.694 --> 00:35:56.095
Trying to say that you're embarrassed
to be seen in an American classic?

421
00:35:56.264 --> 00:35:57.891
This is an American classic?

422
00:35:59.634 --> 00:36:00.965
AII right.

423
00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:02.599
Here we go.

424
00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:04.739
Let's see what you got.

425
00:36:10.045 --> 00:36:11.512
Good shot.

426
00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:14.208
Clay. where are the seatbelts. bro?

427
00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:18.011
We don't need seatbelts.
The G-forces will hold you in your seat.

428
00:36:20.255 --> 00:36:21.347
Jensen, are we wired?

429
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.114
Max is westbound.

430
00:36:25.894 --> 00:36:28.158
And these hot dogs are delicious.

431
00:36:34.335 --> 00:36:37.168
- This is not a sweet car. dog.
- This is a classic.

432
00:36:37.338 --> 00:36:40.102
Yeah. this is a classic piece of shit.

433
00:37:16.911 --> 00:37:19.175
Come on. back up! Move that car!

434
00:37:19.347 --> 00:37:21.008
Lead vehicle hit. Give me the exits.

435
00:37:21.182 --> 00:37:23.343
Northbound and southbound are blocked.

436
00:37:23.518 --> 00:37:24.610
We're trying to clear now.

437
00:37:24.786 --> 00:37:26.276
Dismount.

438
00:37:27.856 --> 00:37:30.324
Form a defensive perimeter
around the package.

439
00:37:41.703 --> 00:37:43.500
This will wake them up.

440
00:37:46.474 --> 00:37:47.566
Masks on!

441
00:38:06.961 --> 00:38:08.258
Oh. shit.

442
00:38:10.598 --> 00:38:11.724
Pooch?

443
00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:16.034
Open fire! Dhoot it down now!

444
00:38:17.372 --> 00:38:18.703
AII right. here we go.

445
00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:35.853
Goddamn.

446
00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:39.720
We are under attack. We need backup.

447
00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:48.262
AII right. easy. Go to your right now.

448
00:38:49.671 --> 00:38:52.037
AII right. ease down. ease down.
To your left.

449
00:38:52.207 --> 00:38:54.107
No. no. your other left. Easy. easy.

450
00:38:54.275 --> 00:38:55.708
- Can you let me do this?
- Dure.

451
00:38:55.877 --> 00:38:56.935
Can you let me do this?

452
00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:04.413
That's right. bitches. I got a crossbow.

453
00:39:06.588 --> 00:39:08.488
Backdoor is sealed. Take him up.

454
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.937
Get out of my way!

455
00:39:34.782 --> 00:39:36.215
Whoa!

456
00:39:38.653 --> 00:39:42.783
- You said small arms weren't a problem.
- Does that look like small arms to you. huh?

457
00:39:42.957 --> 00:39:46.188
- He has a cannon down there.
- Doughnut. Doughnut. doughnut. doughnut!

458
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.894
Dhit!

459
00:39:55.937 --> 00:39:57.268
Dure you've done this before?

460
00:39:57.438 --> 00:40:02.102
Okay. right now. not the time.
Not the time right now.

461
00:40:02.277 --> 00:40:03.938
Pooch. what's your status?

462
00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:08.481
Completely irritated and possibly crashing.
But fish is on the hook.

463
00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:10.344
We got Max.

464
00:40:10.518 --> 00:40:11.576
Barely.

465
00:40:27.869 --> 00:40:32.238
Fellas. You're not gonna believe this shit.
Wade was there.

466
00:40:32.407 --> 00:40:33.669
Wade Travis. 7th Group?

467
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:34.933
He made me. Clay.

468
00:40:35.376 --> 00:40:36.673
No question.

469
00:40:36.844 --> 00:40:39.108
- Who's he?
- Ran counter-guerrilla ops with him.

470
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.805
Just say he's a bad man.

471
00:40:42.684 --> 00:40:44.208
I thought you guys were bad men.

472
00:40:44.385 --> 00:40:47.354
- He's worse.
- AII right. but right now. we need to deal...

473
00:40:47.522 --> 00:40:50.548
with the heavily armed evil genius
inside this truck.

474
00:40:50.725 --> 00:40:51.987
Come on.

475
00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.650
You ready?

476
00:40:57.498 --> 00:40:59.090
Open the valve.

477
00:41:01.736 --> 00:41:03.397
AII right. Iet's unlock this thing.

478
00:41:09.477 --> 00:41:10.876
Hit the ground!

479
00:41:11.646 --> 00:41:13.807
Hit the ground or I'II blow your head off!

480
00:41:14.115 --> 00:41:15.582
Yeah. I don't think so.

481
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.342
First and final warning.

482
00:41:17.685 --> 00:41:20.518
Gasoline. muzzle flash. think about it.

483
00:41:24.192 --> 00:41:25.523
Put them down.

484
00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:33.996
Coug.

485
00:41:35.236 --> 00:41:37.534
- Where is he?
- Who?

486
00:41:38.172 --> 00:41:39.537
Max.

487
00:41:40.942 --> 00:41:41.966
Who the hell is Max?

488
00:41:45.146 --> 00:41:46.738
- I can explain.
- Dhut up.

489
00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:49.473
Jensen. open it.

490
00:41:58.926 --> 00:41:59.950
It's a hard drive...

491
00:42:00.128 --> 00:42:04.622
from Goliath. the multinational
manufacturer of everything.

492
00:42:06.334 --> 00:42:07.528
I'm completely locked out.

493
00:42:07.702 --> 00:42:11.331
Without a decryption key. you're
looking at a really cool paperweight.

494
00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:21.838
Dhoot her. Burn everything.

495
00:42:22.283 --> 00:42:25.081
- Don't you wanna find out what's on it?
- No.

496
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.119
I can't find Max.

497
00:42:28.756 --> 00:42:30.280
Nobody can.

498
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:34.758
But I knew that he was moving something
that was very valuable to him.

499
00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:36.191
Clay!

500
00:42:36.597 --> 00:42:40.863
Whatever it is. we can use it against him.
It's leverage!

501
00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:44.004
The drive is proprietary technology
built by Goliath.

502
00:42:44.172 --> 00:42:46.732
The algorithm's probably
on the mainframe.

503
00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:54.114
- Come on. We're not considering that.
- Wait. wait. wait.

504
00:42:54.282 --> 00:42:57.615
Oh. no. come on. man.
We're not the good guys anymore.

505
00:42:57.785 --> 00:42:59.616
Twenty-five kids.

506
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:03.122
Twenty-five innocent lives lost
because of this guy. Remember?

507
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:04.315
- I do.
- You were there.

508
00:43:04.492 --> 00:43:05.891
Yeah. I was there.

509
00:43:06.627 --> 00:43:08.788
- Max is gonna pay.
- Is this a guilt trip?

510
00:43:08.963 --> 00:43:11.261
No. I don't want him to pay.
I want my life back.

511
00:43:11.432 --> 00:43:15.334
Okay? My life back.
Enough of this revenge bullshit.

512
00:43:16.003 --> 00:43:19.666
- I'm killing her right now.
- You don't like the way I'm running things...

513
00:43:20.074 --> 00:43:22.042
you can find the door.

514
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.643
And go where. Clay?

515
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:25.438
Huh? Go where?

516
00:43:26.114 --> 00:43:29.311
We're fugitives. Because of you.

517
00:43:29.817 --> 00:43:31.717
What the hell are
you gonna do next. huh?

518
00:43:31.886 --> 00:43:34.821
Put us in a box. because you got beat
by a guy on a radio?

519
00:43:34.989 --> 00:43:36.889
- Hey. whoa.
- Okay. all right. all right.

520
00:43:37.091 --> 00:43:39.423
- Cool out. cool out.
- You shouldn't have done that.

521
00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:41.687
- I did do it.
- You shouldn't have done that.

522
00:43:41.896 --> 00:43:43.420
I'm gonna cut your head off. man.

523
00:43:44.265 --> 00:43:45.596
Bring it!

524
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.563
- Hey. get off!
- Roque.

525
00:43:47.768 --> 00:43:50.828
They know we're alive. Roque.

526
00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:54.933
Only thing we have to use against them
right now is that drive.

527
00:43:56.511 --> 00:43:59.480
Dhe framed us. Are you guys blind?
Dhe framed us!

528
00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:02.845
We hit Goliath Worldwide headquarters
in two days.

529
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.508
You want your life back?
You're gonna have to steal it.

530
00:44:06.721 --> 00:44:08.916
You're wrong. you know that. right?

531
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.990
- Again because of a woman!
- Cut her loose.

532
00:44:11.926 --> 00:44:13.393
Cut her loose.

533
00:44:13.895 --> 00:44:15.226
Cut her loose. Roque.

534
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.120
You cut her loose. bro.

535
00:44:23.004 --> 00:44:24.699
This is on you.

536
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.320
We're all set, sir.

537
00:44:45.493 --> 00:44:46.790
Commence.

538
00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:49.327
- Code.
- Pulsar.

539
00:44:51.766 --> 00:44:53.028
What's pulsar?

540
00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:56.393
What do you know about
deep space tachyons?

541
00:44:57.505 --> 00:44:58.631
Nothing.

542
00:45:00.441 --> 00:45:02.705
- Base-particle string theory?
- Nothing.

543
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.605
Dingularity events?

544
00:45:04.779 --> 00:45:06.007
Not a ton.

545
00:45:07.848 --> 00:45:09.975
I think we should move on. then.

546
00:45:17.725 --> 00:45:22.321
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to explain
what happened to my drive.

547
00:45:27.835 --> 00:45:30.133
And who am I looking at here. Wade?

548
00:45:31.005 --> 00:45:32.267
Clay and his unit.

549
00:45:32.473 --> 00:45:36.375
Clay and his unit?
That sounds like a porno. Wade.

550
00:45:36.544 --> 00:45:38.341
You had them killed four months ago.

551
00:45:38.512 --> 00:45:40.605
I've done a lot in four months. Wade.

552
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:42.043
I'm a very busy man.

553
00:45:42.216 --> 00:45:43.808
The Bolivia situation?

554
00:45:44.018 --> 00:45:45.042
Fadhil.

555
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:46.846
The Max intel Fadhil gathered...

556
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:49.815
Was incinerated along
with everything else in the blast.

557
00:45:50.024 --> 00:45:51.286
These guys survived.

558
00:45:51.892 --> 00:45:53.189
And they have my drive.

559
00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:55.060
Yeah.

560
00:45:56.063 --> 00:45:58.930
Okay. so five dead men
hijacked you. Wade.

561
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.398
Did you happen to find out
who's behind them?

562
00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:05.366
- Not the CIA. NDA. special ops.
- Yeah. I'm aware it's not us.

563
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.442
Deems like the only thing we do know is
who they're coming after.

564
00:46:14.949 --> 00:46:18.976
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

565
00:46:20.354 --> 00:46:22.618
- What's the plan?
- What's the plan?

566
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:26.021
The plan is get me
an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

567
00:46:26.193 --> 00:46:28.753
- Okay.
- Are we clear on the plan?

568
00:46:28.929 --> 00:46:31.124
Or we could do it a third time.

569
00:46:31.832 --> 00:46:33.424
- Clear.
- Good.

570
00:46:34.035 --> 00:46:36.765
Oh. Wade. you know what I was thinking?
I forgot earlier.

571
00:46:36.937 --> 00:46:40.168
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

572
00:46:40.808 --> 00:46:42.275
Are we clear?

573
00:47:07.568 --> 00:47:09.058
Do you want some?

574
00:47:47.308 --> 00:47:48.935
Pooch has a wife.

575
00:47:50.311 --> 00:47:52.211
Jensen has a niece.

576
00:47:53.614 --> 00:47:57.948
When all this is over and they go home
to their families. what are you gonna do?

577
00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:02.279
I'II think of something.

578
00:48:03.758 --> 00:48:07.216
They'II never let you be a soldier again.
You know that. right?

579
00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:15.430
- You have no one. do you?
- Do you?

580
00:48:19.006 --> 00:48:20.701
I got Roque.

581
00:48:25.846 --> 00:48:27.245
You know...

582
00:48:27.848 --> 00:48:30.408
if you two really fought...

583
00:48:31.318 --> 00:48:32.478
he would kill you.

584
00:48:35.823 --> 00:48:37.222
Why's that?

585
00:48:37.825 --> 00:48:39.417
Because of the others.

586
00:48:41.162 --> 00:48:42.789
You care what happens to them.

587
00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:45.598
And you think that's a weakness?

588
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.867
I know it is.

589
00:48:49.003 --> 00:48:50.368
It's the law of the jungle.

590
00:48:50.571 --> 00:48:52.664
Well. thankfully. we're not in the jungle.

591
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.364
Yes. we are.

592
00:49:30.811 --> 00:49:31.835
Good morning.

593
00:49:34.815 --> 00:49:35.839
Oh. wow.

594
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:39.213
That's just peachy.

595
00:49:39.386 --> 00:49:40.512
AII right. Iook.

596
00:49:40.688 --> 00:49:43.953
We're not going anywhere
until you two squash this bullshit.

597
00:49:44.124 --> 00:49:46.115
- We are on a schedule here. Let's go.
- Yeah.

598
00:49:46.293 --> 00:49:48.887
Oh. we're on a schedule. Okay.

599
00:49:50.564 --> 00:49:51.690
What are you doing?

600
00:49:58.283 --> 00:49:59.409
Roque...

601
00:50:01.887 --> 00:50:03.946
I'm sorry I hit you in the face.

602
00:50:05.724 --> 00:50:08.192
That was good. That was good. Roque?

603
00:50:08.994 --> 00:50:10.325
Roque?

604
00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:13.794
Clay. I'm sorry I threatened
to cut your head off.

605
00:50:13.966 --> 00:50:16.594
Very good. Wow.

606
00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:19.200
Don't you two feel so much better?

607
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:20.895
- No.
- No.

608
00:50:21.073 --> 00:50:23.473
I don't give a shit. because I do.

609
00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:27.372
Now. I say we go watch Jensen
get himself killed. Yup?

610
00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:41.549
A singer in a smoky room

611
00:50:42.761 --> 00:50:46.162
Smell of wine and cheap perfume

612
00:50:46.531 --> 00:50:49.432
For a smile they can share the night

613
00:50:49.601 --> 00:50:54.163
lt goes on and on And on and on

614
00:50:54.339 --> 00:50:57.866
Strangers waiting

615
00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:01.676
Up and down the boulevard

616
00:51:10.155 --> 00:51:11.884
Goliath Worldwide Enterprises.

617
00:51:12.057 --> 00:51:13.081
Mr. Anderson. please.

618
00:51:13.258 --> 00:51:16.887
Mr. Frank Anderson, Human Resources.
One moment, please.

619
00:51:22.467 --> 00:51:23.491
Wow.

620
00:51:26.038 --> 00:51:29.235
Liking the angle of the dangle? Heh.

621
00:51:29.408 --> 00:51:31.876
- Mm.
- Nice.

622
00:51:34.946 --> 00:51:35.970
This is Anderson.

623
00:51:36.148 --> 00:51:38.878
Mr. Anderson. this is Richard Hertz
from Internal Decurity.

624
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:41.349
I'm wondering if you'd make your way
to the lobby.

625
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.612
What is this about?

626
00:51:42.821 --> 00:51:45.551
Well. it's a matter of somewhat
sensitive nature...

627
00:51:45.724 --> 00:51:49.319
involving an individual exposing himself
to women in the elevator.

628
00:51:49.494 --> 00:51:51.758
Nasty business. really.
Best discussed in person.

629
00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:53.430
AII right. I'm on my way.

630
00:51:53.598 --> 00:51:55.293
I'II see you there.

631
00:52:02.741 --> 00:52:04.299
Thank you.

632
00:52:10.515 --> 00:52:11.846
Hi.

633
00:52:12.017 --> 00:52:15.714
I'm Dkippy from Tech Dupport. here to
install the firewall on Anderson's system.

634
00:52:15.887 --> 00:52:19.550
You just missed him. But if you want.
You can come back in. Iike. an hour?

635
00:52:19.724 --> 00:52:22.249
I could be out in minutes.
He doesn't have to be there.

636
00:52:22.427 --> 00:52:24.486
- You can't go in.
- Upstairs is riding me.

637
00:52:24.696 --> 00:52:28.257
- But you can't... Dir...
- Thank you. I appreciate it. I like your dress.

638
00:52:30.469 --> 00:52:31.800
Dress?

639
00:52:32.838 --> 00:52:33.930
Too much.

640
00:52:36.575 --> 00:52:37.974
Algorithm's on the mainframe.

641
00:52:43.248 --> 00:52:45.113
Downloading it now.

642
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.689
- Dkippy?
- Hey! Dhit.

643
00:52:51.857 --> 00:52:53.882
- Really?
- Oh. ho. wow.

644
00:52:55.594 --> 00:52:57.789
Look. I know this probably doesn't look...

645
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.703
Clay. I need an exit!

646
00:53:06.872 --> 00:53:10.273
Circle around the north side of the building.
You'll have cover.

647
00:53:21.253 --> 00:53:22.720
Freeze!

648
00:53:23.155 --> 00:53:24.850
Wow. this got serious.

649
00:53:33.498 --> 00:53:35.193
I'm warning you.

650
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.394
I am a lethal killing machine.
It was a secret government experiment.

651
00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:45.373
They did stuff to me. Dpooky stuff.

652
00:53:47.078 --> 00:53:48.739
Anal stuff.

653
00:53:49.147 --> 00:53:52.116
Turned me into a dangerous telekinetic.

654
00:53:53.051 --> 00:53:55.747
As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states:

655
00:53:56.288 --> 00:54:00.190
"Don't start none. won't be none."

656
00:54:10.835 --> 00:54:12.666
Telekinetic your way out of this.

657
00:54:13.538 --> 00:54:14.630
- Pow.
- Ah!

658
00:54:16.408 --> 00:54:17.932
- Poof.
- Argh!

659
00:54:22.714 --> 00:54:26.912
Face down. or I'II make your heart
stop beating with my mind.

660
00:54:32.557 --> 00:54:33.581
Thank you. Cougar.

661
00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:45.227
- Who's got the hard drive?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:46.805 --> 00:54:49.273
And uploading the algorithm.

663
00:54:51.343 --> 00:54:52.640
And....

664
00:54:53.545 --> 00:54:57.140
Holy shit. Girlfriend was right.
Ha. ha. ha.

665
00:54:57.415 --> 00:54:59.406
- It's a courier drive.
- A what?

666
00:54:59.584 --> 00:55:02.485
Twenty-first-century bagman.
Russian mob banks pioneered them.

667
00:55:02.654 --> 00:55:04.986
- Like an electronic bearer bond.
- Okay. all right.

668
00:55:05.156 --> 00:55:07.750
Day that again.
But a lot slower and dumber. please.

669
00:55:08.426 --> 00:55:10.690
Okay. Pretend you are super evil.

670
00:55:10.862 --> 00:55:13.831
And you want to move
a ton of your ill-gotten blood money...

671
00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:17.127
but you can't.
Because it can be tracked.

672
00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:19.235
Do you load your cash onto
this bad boy...

673
00:55:19.404 --> 00:55:21.998
and you can physically move it
anywhere you wanna go.

674
00:55:22.173 --> 00:55:24.471
And we have Max's courier drive. right?

675
00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:27.676
We have Max's $400 million.

676
00:55:29.314 --> 00:55:32.044
AII right. Clay. before you go
do something noble like smashing it...

677
00:55:32.217 --> 00:55:34.151
I say we go on Amazon
and get a jet.

678
00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:35.616
It doesn't work that way.

679
00:55:35.787 --> 00:55:39.314
Unfortunately courier drives can only load
and unload on their home systems.

680
00:55:39.524 --> 00:55:44.188
Although if we were gonna buy stuff.
I'd say a canary-yellow stretch Hummer.

681
00:55:44.362 --> 00:55:46.592
No. no. We're gonna trade it back to him.

682
00:55:46.798 --> 00:55:48.891
He's gonna get his money
and clear our names.

683
00:55:49.067 --> 00:55:50.432
- No. we made a deal.
- Yes.

684
00:55:50.635 --> 00:55:51.863
Aisha.

685
00:55:53.071 --> 00:55:55.039
He's gotta kill us now. You know that.

686
00:55:56.441 --> 00:55:57.567
Yeah. I know that.

687
00:55:57.742 --> 00:56:00.711
This has a record of every IP address
it's been jacked into.

688
00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:03.712
And there's one address
that comes up a lot.

689
00:56:03.915 --> 00:56:05.974
Obviously someplace
this keeps going back to.

690
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:07.209
Max's base of ops.

691
00:56:10.155 --> 00:56:12.020
Port of Los Angeles.

692
00:56:14.926 --> 00:56:17.918
Thing probably has files on
every black-book op he's ever pulled.

693
00:56:18.963 --> 00:56:20.021
Including Bolivia.

694
00:56:20.332 --> 00:56:22.527
We could hit him there.
We could clean it out...

695
00:56:22.701 --> 00:56:25.067
expose the world to what he's done.

696
00:56:25.236 --> 00:56:26.703
Clear our names in the process.

697
00:56:27.472 --> 00:56:29.565
AII right. it's a good plan.

698
00:56:31.209 --> 00:56:32.301
And we still kill him.

699
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.538
Absolutely.

700
00:56:40.752 --> 00:56:44.153
We appreciate you meeting us
at a single-story facility.

701
00:56:44.322 --> 00:56:45.687
No problem.

702
00:56:45.857 --> 00:56:48.155
I view that entire incident
as your standard...

703
00:56:48.326 --> 00:56:50.760
"getting to know each other"
business orientation.

704
00:56:50.929 --> 00:56:52.055
I agree.

705
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.027
But now that we do know each other...

706
00:56:54.199 --> 00:56:58.636
know that if you ever come near me with
that Yankee Doodle. tough-guy bullshit...

707
00:56:58.803 --> 00:57:01.328
you will be fed to my dogs.

708
00:57:03.208 --> 00:57:05.870
As you know. we had a hiccup
on our end with the money.

709
00:57:06.044 --> 00:57:08.877
One billion dollars. This is the new price.

710
00:57:09.047 --> 00:57:10.981
- One billion?
- Cash.

711
00:57:11.149 --> 00:57:12.810
Cash is gonna be difficult.

712
00:57:12.984 --> 00:57:17.921
Difficult? Mr. Wade. Iife the way
you people want to live it is difficult.

713
00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:21.786
You want less difficult?
Move to my country. Dtudy Hinduism.

714
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.021
Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
Way less difficult.

715
00:57:26.197 --> 00:57:29.189
But you want to buy bombs.

716
00:57:30.435 --> 00:57:33.563
I'm afraid that's a more difficult
way of life.

717
00:57:34.572 --> 00:57:36.039
Mr. Wade.

718
00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:07.028
Hello.

719
00:58:07.939 --> 00:58:10.669
He wants one billion. in cash.

720
00:58:10.842 --> 00:58:12.275
That's a lot of paper routes.

721
00:58:13.545 --> 00:58:14.944
Dtay wet.

722
00:58:15.814 --> 00:58:18.442
Did you get me my 18-man firing team
I asked for?

723
00:58:18.616 --> 00:58:20.208
- Yup.
- Okay.

724
00:58:20.652 --> 00:58:23.246
Change of plans. Kill them.

725
00:58:23.455 --> 00:58:24.945
Kill my 18 guys?

726
00:58:25.123 --> 00:58:27.523
Or fire them. Whichever is easiest.

727
00:58:27.692 --> 00:58:29.853
Honestly. firing them.

728
00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:32.997
Okay. Did you give them intel
on Clay's people?

729
00:58:33.364 --> 00:58:36.265
- Well. yeah.
- And we're back to killing them.

730
00:58:37.402 --> 00:58:40.894
Fine. I'II kill them.
What are we doing instead?

731
00:58:41.072 --> 00:58:43.267
What's the matter? You related to them?

732
00:58:43.475 --> 00:58:44.908
Actually one of them. yeah.

733
00:58:45.376 --> 00:58:47.037
Really? By blood?

734
00:58:47.245 --> 00:58:50.646
A brother-in-Iaw. I said I'd kill him.
What are we doing?

735
00:58:51.149 --> 00:58:55.449
It's not what we're gonna do.
It's what Clay's gonna do for us.

736
00:58:55.653 --> 00:58:59.419
- And that is?
- Get us our billion. baby.

737
00:59:10.935 --> 00:59:12.163
What are we up against?

738
00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:19.100
Chryon.

739
00:59:19.277 --> 00:59:20.835
Oh. shit.

740
00:59:21.279 --> 00:59:22.541
Who's Chryon?

741
00:59:22.714 --> 00:59:25.581
Chryon Decurity Dolutions.
Ex-Dpecial Forces.

742
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:29.117
Basically a bunch of guys like Cougar
without the warm and cuddly side.

743
00:59:31.723 --> 00:59:34.385
We start recon at 0600.

744
00:59:34.726 --> 00:59:37.092
Anyone not here for it...

745
00:59:37.996 --> 00:59:39.327
I'II understand.

746
00:59:58.316 --> 01:00:00.614
I was just going over the plan.

747
01:00:01.586 --> 01:00:03.611
You wanna go over the plan?

748
01:00:04.422 --> 01:00:06.481
Let's go over the plan.

749
01:00:14.866 --> 01:00:16.697
Ah. shit.

750
01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:18.199
You okay?

751
01:00:18.903 --> 01:00:21.133
Petunias are playing the Marigolds
on Dunday.

752
01:00:22.006 --> 01:00:23.564
Do?

753
01:00:24.075 --> 01:00:26.066
These are the Marigolds.

754
01:00:26.244 --> 01:00:27.768
Whoa.

755
01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:30.276
- Those are some hard-Iooking 8-year-olds.
- I know.

756
01:00:30.448 --> 01:00:32.814
Look at these inmates. Heh. heh.

757
01:00:33.484 --> 01:00:34.712
What are you doing?

758
01:00:36.721 --> 01:00:41.488
I was just trying to connect
Fadhil's drug operation with Max's cash.

759
01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:44.492
There's about 4 million missing.
I'm trying to track it down.

760
01:00:45.697 --> 01:00:49.394
- What are you doing. Pooch?
- Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.

761
01:00:49.567 --> 01:00:51.194
What you need a satellite for?

762
01:00:55.807 --> 01:00:57.138
Wait a second. is that today?

763
01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:59.677
Yeah.

764
01:00:59.877 --> 01:01:01.868
Probably knows
if it's a boy or a girl now.

765
01:01:02.046 --> 01:01:04.207
- Congratulations. man.
- Congratulations.

766
01:01:04.382 --> 01:01:05.508
Thank you. man.

767
01:01:05.683 --> 01:01:08.049
Day that now. but you know Jolene.

768
01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:10.414
Dhe finds out I'm alive.
She's gonna kill me.

769
01:01:14.993 --> 01:01:17.325
I can't let her have that baby
without me.

770
01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:23.191
What? What?

771
01:01:23.801 --> 01:01:26.031
Pooch. we all know
we're gonna die in there.

772
01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.005
And we can do that without you.

773
01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:32.938
No. you can't.

774
01:01:33.378 --> 01:01:34.777
Go home.

775
01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:38.610
Got it.

776
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:42.317
Fadhil's 4 million didn't disappear.
It just went into a private account.

777
01:01:42.487 --> 01:01:43.818
Whose account?

778
01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:45.387
It's a family trust.

779
01:01:45.723 --> 01:01:48.954
Days that in the event of his death.
Goes to his kid.

780
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.752
Name of....

781
01:01:51.129 --> 01:01:53.689
- Dhit.
- Wow.

782
01:01:55.266 --> 01:01:56.790
Tell me what happened in Bolivia.

783
01:02:02.073 --> 01:02:04.234
We thought we were on a legitimate op.

784
01:02:04.776 --> 01:02:07.210
Paint a terrorist camp
so we could bomb it.

785
01:02:08.613 --> 01:02:12.344
Turns out we were just executing
some Max vendetta.

786
01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.875
Do you knew nothing about Fadhil?

787
01:02:15.053 --> 01:02:16.680
A target's a target.

788
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:21.986
Never would have known the difference
if we hadn't seen those kids and gone in.

789
01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:26.059
You went in?

790
01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:28.360
Well. yeah. We had to.

791
01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:32.332
It was 25 innocent kids in there. Aisha.

792
01:02:34.038 --> 01:02:35.062
Did you see him?

793
01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:37.836
Yeah.

794
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:40.707
Why do you wanna know all this?

795
01:02:41.012 --> 01:02:44.539
Did you kill Fadhil. Clay?

796
01:02:45.883 --> 01:02:47.578
Who are you?

797
01:02:50.254 --> 01:02:51.983
Dhe's Fadhil's daughter. Clay!

798
01:02:52.156 --> 01:02:54.124
Dhe's Fadhil's daughter!
Fadhil's daughter.

799
01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:55.850
Oh. shit.

800
01:02:58.262 --> 01:03:01.720
Dhe's got a gun and it's pointed at my dick.
Clay. it's pointed at my dick.

801
01:03:02.133 --> 01:03:03.760
Rather it was pointed at your face?

802
01:03:03.935 --> 01:03:05.732
I know it makes no sense. but yes.

803
01:03:07.905 --> 01:03:09.065
Better?

804
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.264
Not really.

805
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:12.568
- Where's your gun. Jensen?
- In the van.

806
01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:14.735
- What's it doing there?
- Not much.

807
01:03:14.912 --> 01:03:17.540
- Would you shut up?
- What if it was pointed at your dick?

808
01:03:53.184 --> 01:03:55.118
- Aah!
- J. where you hit?

809
01:03:55.286 --> 01:03:57.083
Dhe shot me in my arm!

810
01:03:57.288 --> 01:03:59.222
You're gonna live. You're gonna live.

811
01:04:01.159 --> 01:04:02.683
Cougar. be gentle!

812
01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:09.395
Clay.

813
01:04:09.934 --> 01:04:12.164
We gotta go. now.

814
01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:15.839
Come on.

815
01:04:22.113 --> 01:04:25.344
Home again. home again. jiggety-jig.

816
01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:35.723
- Do you have the money?
- Jesus.

817
01:04:35.893 --> 01:04:37.861
Always with the money.

818
01:04:38.529 --> 01:04:43.364
Hi. how are you?
How've you been? Namaste?

819
01:04:43.568 --> 01:04:47.902
I recently attended the funeral of my
best friend who you had thrown off a roof.

820
01:04:48.072 --> 01:04:49.562
How have you been?

821
01:04:50.374 --> 01:04:52.001
I can't complain.

822
01:04:52.176 --> 01:04:56.044
Actually I'm thinking about getting
a satellite radio for my car.

823
01:04:57.915 --> 01:04:59.405
God. you are short.

824
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:01.646
Deriously. how much do you weigh?

825
01:05:01.853 --> 01:05:03.878
Are you standing in a hole? What...?

826
01:05:04.722 --> 01:05:06.246
We have your ordnances.

827
01:05:07.592 --> 01:05:11.653
Alrighty. Let's make a cash withdrawal.

828
01:05:12.196 --> 01:05:16.565
And who want to be a billionaire?

829
01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:41.815
Dhe burned us.

830
01:05:44.795 --> 01:05:46.057
The whole op's blown.

831
01:05:48.432 --> 01:05:50.457
Dhe knows our names. faces.

832
01:05:52.336 --> 01:05:54.031
Does she know about our families?

833
01:05:55.206 --> 01:05:57.174
Damn it. Clay. Iook at me.

834
01:06:00.511 --> 01:06:02.741
Does she know about our families?

835
01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:08.076
Yes.

836
01:06:12.823 --> 01:06:14.688
I gotta go home. to Dpringfield.

837
01:06:16.127 --> 01:06:19.221
Jensen can come with me.
His niece is in New Hampshire.

838
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:21.955
I'm done.

839
01:06:27.305 --> 01:06:30.900
Well. I'm going to the port. okay?

840
01:06:36.347 --> 01:06:38.679
You get back to your families.

841
01:06:39.917 --> 01:06:41.248
We'II get Max.

842
01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:46.118
I did this. I made the call in Bolivia.
I put your families in danger.

843
01:06:46.324 --> 01:06:47.848
Just let me and Clay finish this.

844
01:06:48.025 --> 01:06:50.118
Do you two idiots are gonna
go in there blind?

845
01:06:55.566 --> 01:06:57.124
Three.

846
01:06:58.436 --> 01:07:01.633
Hey. getting shot's great.
I'm up for doing it again.

847
01:07:02.606 --> 01:07:03.868
Four idiots.

848
01:07:10.648 --> 01:07:11.706
You sons of bitches.

849
01:07:17.922 --> 01:07:19.048
I'II drive.

850
01:07:19.223 --> 01:07:20.622
Five.

851
01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:55.722
We're in. Dtatus?

852
01:07:56.227 --> 01:07:58.195
The Pooch is good.

853
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:01.691
AII right. Mojito.
It's just me and you. Papi.

854
01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.300
And this hot-ass van.

855
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.924
Hey. you!

856
01:08:54.151 --> 01:08:56.016
And disco.

857
01:08:58.956 --> 01:09:01.288
- What's the password?
- Let us in or I'II kill you.

858
01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:03.350
Correct.

859
01:09:03.828 --> 01:09:06.729
Main server is two skylights over.
I'm coming out of that door.

860
01:09:06.897 --> 01:09:10.765
Be ready to move as soon as Cougar
hits the fire alarm. Get gone.

861
01:09:27.084 --> 01:09:30.679
I'm above the computer room.
Maybe 30 seconds out.

862
01:09:31.155 --> 01:09:32.520
Dhit.

863
01:09:33.257 --> 01:09:34.281
Wade's here.

864
01:09:35.626 --> 01:09:37.958
Last chance to get the hell out of Dodge.

865
01:09:38.195 --> 01:09:39.219
Roger that.

866
01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.932
- Hey. Clay.
- Yeah?

867
01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:46.194
Check this out.

868
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.635
Go. Petunias.

869
01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:58.079
And the crowd goes wild.

870
01:09:58.549 --> 01:10:00.312
Where do you think you're going?

871
01:10:00.618 --> 01:10:01.710
How you guys doing?

872
01:10:01.886 --> 01:10:03.581
Cougar, squelch when you're in position.

873
01:10:03.754 --> 01:10:04.846
Dquelch.

874
01:10:12.997 --> 01:10:14.589
Cougs? Cougs?

875
01:10:14.765 --> 01:10:16.630
Well. what do we have here?

876
01:10:17.668 --> 01:10:18.726
What's up. fellas?

877
01:10:21.639 --> 01:10:23.766
I think someone's trying to set us up.

878
01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:27.070
Jesus.

879
01:10:28.913 --> 01:10:30.278
Domething's not right.

880
01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:34.443
Oh. yeah?

881
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.130
Hello. Clay.

882
01:10:54.572 --> 01:10:55.834
Roque.

883
01:10:56.807 --> 01:10:58.468
Wade.

884
01:11:00.077 --> 01:11:01.544
Yeah.

885
01:11:02.746 --> 01:11:06.978
After the Miami fiasco. I cut a deal. Clay.

886
01:11:11.155 --> 01:11:12.315
You're a goddamn traitor.

887
01:11:12.489 --> 01:11:14.252
No. you betrayed us!

888
01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:19.061
You were gonna keep planning missions. ways to find Max.
Until you got us all killed.

889
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.063
- No.
- Yes! I tried to tell you. You wouldn't listen.

890
01:11:22.233 --> 01:11:26.294
No. you wanted your revenge.
The face-to-face with the big bad wolf.

891
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:29.132
The voice on the radio. AII that bullshit.

892
01:11:29.473 --> 01:11:30.872
Now I get to walk away.

893
01:11:31.075 --> 01:11:32.508
We all would've walked. Roque.

894
01:11:35.145 --> 01:11:36.442
Don't you get it yet?

895
01:11:37.781 --> 01:11:39.544
There's no server.

896
01:11:41.919 --> 01:11:43.580
Max lured you here.

897
01:11:44.255 --> 01:11:46.883
This is a CIA cash stash.

898
01:11:47.725 --> 01:11:52.822
Kill me now
and maybe you walk away from this.

899
01:11:53.163 --> 01:11:54.653
No. you die later.

900
01:11:54.832 --> 01:11:57.300
You're about to steal a billion dollars
from the CIA.

901
01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.099
Congratulations. Roque.

902
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.505
You just helped these assholes
get everything they need to start a war.

903
01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.079
We cool?

904
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.988
He's not my problem.

905
01:12:19.523 --> 01:12:20.888
Take him away.

906
01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:24.193
Let's get back to the boat.

907
01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:27.928
Hold on. Hold on.

908
01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:34.003
I followed you everywhere. man.
Everywhere.

909
01:12:35.072 --> 01:12:37.632
Just couldn't do that shit no more.

910
01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:40.739
You're gonna die very badly.

911
01:12:43.714 --> 01:12:45.113
No.

912
01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:55.284
Come on. Iet's go.

913
01:13:01.865 --> 01:13:05.824
Do you have any fours?

914
01:13:07.738 --> 01:13:08.762
Go fish?

915
01:13:11.675 --> 01:13:14.872
You actually have two fours. Two.

916
01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:17.240
You don't understand this game. do you?

917
01:13:24.388 --> 01:13:27.016
Looks like somebody's money's here.

918
01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:30.392
By the way...

919
01:13:30.594 --> 01:13:32.528
your ordnances are right here.

920
01:13:32.696 --> 01:13:33.856
Tricky Vikki.

921
01:13:37.634 --> 01:13:39.158
Four snukes and a Ducati.

922
01:13:40.471 --> 01:13:41.836
As requested.

923
01:13:49.213 --> 01:13:50.237
Do you're Max?

924
01:13:52.282 --> 01:13:53.715
Welcome to the team.

925
01:13:59.022 --> 01:14:01.855
Dupervise the loading of the money
onto our plane.

926
01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:03.350
What do you mean?

927
01:14:06.497 --> 01:14:07.555
What do you mean?!

928
01:14:08.799 --> 01:14:10.790
New change of plan.

929
01:14:29.586 --> 01:14:30.883
Roque.

930
01:14:32.356 --> 01:14:33.380
Move.

931
01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:36.252
Move it. Let's go.

932
01:14:42.266 --> 01:14:44.928
- Get down on your knees.
- You heard him.

933
01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.101
No?

934
01:15:01.185 --> 01:15:02.675
Pooch!

935
01:15:03.887 --> 01:15:06.822
- Don of a bitch!
- You know. I like that hat.

936
01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:08.651
That's a great hat.

937
01:15:09.827 --> 01:15:11.522
Hey.

938
01:15:13.163 --> 01:15:15.393
I really don't care if
there's a hole in it.

939
01:15:21.004 --> 01:15:22.733
What are you smiling at?

940
01:15:28.078 --> 01:15:29.443
Now that's a bad-ass chick.

941
01:15:57.541 --> 01:15:58.735
Payback's a bitch.

942
01:16:04.014 --> 01:16:06.710
Never touch the hat. Hm?

943
01:16:19.796 --> 01:16:21.423
Can you stand?

944
01:16:21.598 --> 01:16:23.862
I've been shot in both of my legs.

945
01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:26.502
What kind of dumbass question
is that? Really?

946
01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.297
Do now we're Mr. Grumpy Pants.

947
01:16:28.472 --> 01:16:30.770
You're not the only one
who's been shot today.

948
01:16:31.742 --> 01:16:33.801
Dude. you're standing.

949
01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:36.409
Back it up.

950
01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:44.213
I'm gonna need you
to arm this device right now.

951
01:16:44.721 --> 01:16:47.952
Extremists are about to be framed for
cratering the great Port of L.A.

952
01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:51.390
- You are insane.
- I am engineering a global terrorist conflict...

953
01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:55.622
that's finally gonna restore some order
to this big blue marble.

954
01:16:57.067 --> 01:17:00.059
Now light the firecracker.

955
01:17:13.116 --> 01:17:14.481
Cougs.

956
01:17:16.587 --> 01:17:17.611
Clay!

957
01:17:18.589 --> 01:17:19.988
Did you kill him?

958
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.790
My father found out about
Max's real plans.

959
01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:28.193
He was gonna stop him.

960
01:17:28.999 --> 01:17:31.559
Did you kill him?

961
01:17:34.638 --> 01:17:36.071
Yes.

962
01:17:38.542 --> 01:17:42.137
- Aisha. he was a bad man.
- It doesn't matter!

963
01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:44.405
I know.

964
01:17:46.049 --> 01:17:48.381
You can kill me right now.

965
01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:51.316
Or you can let me help you do
what you need to do.

966
01:17:52.456 --> 01:17:55.653
Either way. I get it.

967
01:18:08.071 --> 01:18:09.629
Let's go get Max.

968
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:15.203
Wade said boat.
That means we're at the docks.

969
01:18:15.379 --> 01:18:16.641
Pooch. can you stand?

970
01:18:18.281 --> 01:18:20.112
Oh. Oh. this is stupid question day.

971
01:18:20.283 --> 01:18:22.808
This is stupid question day.
Nobody decided to tell me.

972
01:18:22.986 --> 01:18:26.513
- No. that's cool. That's awesome.
- Come on. Legless Pooch. I got you.

973
01:18:27.457 --> 01:18:29.550
- Here we go.
- AII right. Iet's move.

974
01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.285
This isn't over yet.

975
01:18:57.688 --> 01:19:02.022
Come on. fellas. I hate to rush you.
But I got a plane to catch.

976
01:19:06.096 --> 01:19:07.154
Come on!

977
01:19:26.917 --> 01:19:29.579
There you go. there you go!
Get it in there. Iet's go!

978
01:19:31.755 --> 01:19:34.485
I got Roque. Rest of you get Wade.
Cougar. run point cover.

979
01:19:34.658 --> 01:19:36.819
Legless Pooch and I are on it.
Come on. buddy.

980
01:19:41.064 --> 01:19:44.363
Call me Legless Pooch again.
You're gonna be Headless Jensen.

981
01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:48.396
I think it's a cool name.
Makes you sound like a pirate.

982
01:19:48.572 --> 01:19:49.630
Your mama's a pirate.

983
01:19:58.281 --> 01:19:59.714
Go!

984
01:20:02.152 --> 01:20:03.517
Cover me!

985
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.364
- Get us in the air.
- We don't have room for lift.

986
01:20:19.536 --> 01:20:22.266
Hey. do as you're told!
Go down there and turn around!

987
01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.268
- Dhit!
- Damn it.

988
01:20:42.192 --> 01:20:45.320
You know. I always wondered
how this was gonna play out. Clay.

989
01:20:45.495 --> 01:20:47.963
I told you already. You die very badly.

990
01:20:49.065 --> 01:20:50.259
Oh. yeah?

991
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:52.025
AII right.

992
01:21:08.018 --> 01:21:09.883
Oh. my God.

993
01:21:13.690 --> 01:21:15.681
Jensen. run! Run!

994
01:21:28.672 --> 01:21:31.402
- Now I'm definitely gonna cut your head off.
- Go for it.

995
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.514
Don of a bitch!

996
01:21:54.564 --> 01:21:55.690
You lose!

997
01:22:10.714 --> 01:22:12.875
We're clear to take off.
Get us out of here.

998
01:22:13.049 --> 01:22:14.073
Okay. all right.

999
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:15.616
- Get us out of here.
- Okay!

1000
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.088
The ordnance is live.

1001
01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:21.782
And this is the remote trigger.

1002
01:22:23.927 --> 01:22:26.760
Detonation in ten, nine...

1003
01:22:33.336 --> 01:22:35.395
That son of a bitch is stealing our cash!

1004
01:23:02.065 --> 01:23:04.727
Clay, Wade's on the move.

1005
01:23:05.101 --> 01:23:06.363
Clay!

1006
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:09.102
You got Wade coming at you!

1007
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:23.113
- Run him over.
- What?

1008
01:23:23.286 --> 01:23:24.310
Run him over!

1009
01:23:43.707 --> 01:23:45.038
Take him.

1010
01:24:16.406 --> 01:24:18.033
Outstanding.

1011
01:24:27.717 --> 01:24:29.116
Clay, we got a situation here.

1012
01:24:29.285 --> 01:24:32.982
L'm looking at a giant, vibrating
Easter egg from hell and no Max.

1013
01:24:33.156 --> 01:24:34.248
I think I see him.

1014
01:24:34.424 --> 01:24:37.552
Initiate backup plan C.

1015
01:24:39.462 --> 01:24:41.259
The one where you rescue me.

1016
01:24:53.243 --> 01:24:54.540
Dhit.

1017
01:25:01.418 --> 01:25:03.318
ETA? I'm at rendezvous.

1018
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:07.814
Hello?

1019
01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:09.817
Hello?

1020
01:25:11.061 --> 01:25:14.258
What's the matter? Crappy reception?

1021
01:25:24.674 --> 01:25:26.938
- That was my ride.
- Bummer.

1022
01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:29.610
- Clay. is it?
- Colonel.

1023
01:25:29.779 --> 01:25:31.406
Do you know what this is. then?

1024
01:25:31.614 --> 01:25:33.912
- Remote pressure trigger.
- Very good.

1025
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:37.649
I release the button for ten seconds
and everything goes boom.

1026
01:25:39.422 --> 01:25:41.754
Do since you can't shoot me...

1027
01:25:44.227 --> 01:25:45.660
Goddamn it!

1028
01:25:45.829 --> 01:25:47.296
You wanna try that again?

1029
01:25:48.998 --> 01:25:50.397
That hurt.

1030
01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:55.128
Having fun? Enjoying yourself?

1031
01:25:55.305 --> 01:25:57.034
Give me the trigger. I let you live.

1032
01:25:57.207 --> 01:25:59.573
You know the worst thing about
being the good guy?

1033
01:25:59.776 --> 01:26:00.800
What's that?

1034
01:26:03.246 --> 01:26:04.873
Having to make decisions like this.

1035
01:26:39.215 --> 01:26:42.673
Hey! Ha. ha. ha. Look what Pooch found!

1036
01:26:42.886 --> 01:26:44.217
Look what I found.

1037
01:26:44.988 --> 01:26:46.512
This should do it.

1038
01:26:52.195 --> 01:26:53.219
Disarmed.

1039
01:26:56.032 --> 01:26:57.260
Hello?

1040
01:27:01.437 --> 01:27:02.870
It's Max.

1041
01:27:08.344 --> 01:27:09.470
Hi. Max.

1042
01:27:09.646 --> 01:27:12.012
Colonel. Nice catch.

1043
01:27:12.182 --> 01:27:16.209
We could've shared the dream together.
Now you're back to where you started.

1044
01:27:16.386 --> 01:27:18.616
Yeah. well. I wouldn't go that far.

1045
01:27:18.788 --> 01:27:20.050
Why's that?

1046
01:27:20.223 --> 01:27:22.714
Well. now I know what you look like.

1047
01:27:23.092 --> 01:27:25.526
Be seeing you soon. Max.

1048
01:27:36.706 --> 01:27:38.731
It's a nice watch. homes.

1049
01:27:47.183 --> 01:27:48.707
Come with us.

1050
01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.520
When this is over and he's dead...

1051
01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:57.692
you and I are gonna finish that dance.

1052
01:27:59.162 --> 01:28:01.062
Fair enough.

1053
01:28:03.866 --> 01:28:06.426
Yo. Iet's go home.

1054
01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:08.800
Dhe is volatile.

1055
01:28:19.048 --> 01:28:20.743
Poppa. Poppa. we are clear.

1056
01:28:21.551 --> 01:28:23.178
Detting perimeter.

1057
01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.587
You're five by.

1058
01:28:28.891 --> 01:28:31.257
I'm a little nervous
about this one. colonel.

1059
01:28:33.129 --> 01:28:36.064
Whatever happens.
You get to that package.

1060
01:28:43.573 --> 01:28:46.064
- Mission is live.
- Acknowledged.

1061
01:28:48.645 --> 01:28:50.112
I'm in.

1062
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:04.692
Okay. The Pooch can do this.

1063
01:29:07.463 --> 01:29:09.988
The Pooch can do this.

1064
01:29:17.674 --> 01:29:19.039
Hey.

1065
01:29:19.208 --> 01:29:20.698
Dir. you can't come in here.

1066
01:29:20.877 --> 01:29:22.174
It's okay.

1067
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.340
I'm the father.

1068
01:29:25.848 --> 01:29:27.338
Where the hell have you been?

1069
01:29:29.018 --> 01:29:30.383
Traffic.

1070
01:29:32.889 --> 01:29:34.049
Traffic?

1071
01:29:42.532 --> 01:29:46.298
Lt's a boy. lt's a boy, Clay.

1072
01:29:46.469 --> 01:29:48.937
- And he looks just like me.
- Congrats.

1073
01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:53.206
Cheers.

1074
01:30:18.668 --> 01:30:21.535
- We're taking a big chance here.
- They're getting slaughtered.

1075
01:30:29.946 --> 01:30:33.438
Come on. ref! Watch number nine!
Dhe's throwing elbows!

1076
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:34.946
- Dhh.
- Dhh.

1077
01:30:36.386 --> 01:30:38.115
Dorry. I'm sorry.

1078
01:30:39.989 --> 01:30:42.355
Hi. My niece. number 21.

1079
01:30:42.992 --> 01:30:44.254
Dhe's the star of the team.

1080
01:30:46.996 --> 01:30:48.395
- Diaper change.
- What?

1081
01:30:50.666 --> 01:30:54.067
- Colonel. you wanna jump on this for me?
- I'd rather jump on a live grenade.

1082
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:56.636
I'm invested.
I have 100 dollars on this game.

1083
01:30:56.839 --> 01:30:59.273
Who'd you find to bet
on a girls' soccer game with?

1084
01:30:59.442 --> 01:31:01.171
Yeah.

1085
01:31:01.344 --> 01:31:02.675
You bet against the Petunias?

1086
01:31:02.845 --> 01:31:04.244
Well. he gave me points.

1087
01:31:04.447 --> 01:31:06.005
Big mistake.

1088
01:31:06.416 --> 01:31:08.077
Let's go. girls. Let's go. girls!

1089
01:31:11.487 --> 01:31:12.818
Oh. no.

1090
01:31:16.492 --> 01:31:18.892
Hey. hey. hey! You okay?
Are you all right?

1091
01:31:19.095 --> 01:31:23.555
- What is that? That is a foul! Are you blind?
- Get off the field. sir! Are you blind?

1092
01:31:23.766 --> 01:31:25.427
Hey. boss. boss.

1093
01:31:26.068 --> 01:31:29.003
- Get off the field!
- You're not gonna blow your whistle?

1094
01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:30.332
Oh. yeah. yeah.

1095
01:31:30.973 --> 01:31:32.372
- Better...
- Yeah. we should.

1096
01:31:32.542 --> 01:31:34.874
- A girl kicked to the ground is not a foul?
- Get off!

1097
01:31:35.044 --> 01:31:38.309
I wanna know who you work for!
How high up does this go?

1098
01:31:38.514 --> 01:31:39.674
Get off the field!

1099
01:31:39.849 --> 01:31:42.010
This is worse than the NBA!

1100
01:31:42.218 --> 01:31:43.310
Okay. come on.

1101
01:31:43.786 --> 01:31:45.515
Come on. Loser!

1102
01:31:45.688 --> 01:31:47.553
You don't deserve to wear those stripes!

1103
01:37:09.868 --> 01:37:13.463
I've been a fan of Zoe's
for a long time. I just thought she...

1104
01:37:13.639 --> 01:37:16.130
first. Iooked very much like
the character in the graphic.

1105
01:37:16.308 --> 01:37:19.141
And I knew she could have
the physicality that the role demanded.

1106
01:37:21.947 --> 01:37:23.938
The reality of playing
the only female...

1107
01:37:24.116 --> 01:37:29.053
but also being. Iike. a badass female
was very enticing to me. Very.

1108
01:37:30.622 --> 01:37:34.217
AII of us actors are
a bunch of guys and we act like it.

1109
01:37:34.393 --> 01:37:37.624
To kind of fit in to that.
You know. she has to be pretty tough...

1110
01:37:37.796 --> 01:37:42.597
and have a good sense of humor.
And I'II be damned if she doesn't fit in.

1111
01:37:42.768 --> 01:37:45.828
Training with guns. and the fighting
and everything was much easier...

1112
01:37:46.038 --> 01:37:51.135
than just doing the research of how
I was gonna play Aisha.

1113
01:37:57.482 --> 01:38:00.508
It's not the typical role for a woman
in an action film.

1114
01:38:00.686 --> 01:38:03.951
Dhe's not the lady in distress
that the guys have to rescue.

1115
01:38:04.122 --> 01:38:05.419
It's quite the contrary here.

1116
01:38:05.591 --> 01:38:08.321
Listen. you guys can all stay here
in Bolivia and rot.

1117
01:38:08.493 --> 01:38:11.485
Or you can go home and get revenge
on the man that framed you.

1118
01:38:11.697 --> 01:38:13.096
It's your choice.

1119
01:38:13.265 --> 01:38:17.599
Dhe makes them an offer that sounds
too good to be true.

1120
01:38:17.769 --> 01:38:21.261
And. um... But it's also an offer
that they can't refuse.

1121
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.136
There's a lot of mistrust
from the beginning...

1122
01:38:24.309 --> 01:38:27.870
because you don't know
what this woman is hiding up her sleeve.

1123
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.547
I'm gonna go ahead
and kill her.

1124
01:38:29.715 --> 01:38:31.683
- Ha. ha. Are you now?
- Right now.

1125
01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:33.477
- Yeah?
- No. you're not.

1126
01:38:34.319 --> 01:38:36.219
I'm right here.

1127
01:38:36.688 --> 01:38:39.657
If you wanna shoot your bankroll.
Go right ahead.

1128
01:38:39.825 --> 01:38:41.952
You better not miss.

1129
01:38:42.694 --> 01:38:45.561
Okay. you get to stay.

1130
01:38:45.731 --> 01:38:49.098
But if anything smells like a setup.
I get to put a bullet in your skull.

1131
01:38:49.268 --> 01:38:51.236
Does that sound fair to you?

1132
01:38:51.403 --> 01:38:52.665
That sounds fun.

1133
01:38:52.838 --> 01:38:56.535
Dhe's the badass who. you know.
Gives them their call to action...

1134
01:38:56.708 --> 01:38:59.575
who rescues them from the villains.
Who rescues them from death.

1135
01:38:59.745 --> 01:39:03.806
I think Dylvain really knew
who he wanted. I feel really grateful...

1136
01:39:03.982 --> 01:39:06.815
because by the time we all had
the wardrobe. and the hair...

1137
01:39:06.985 --> 01:39:12.355
and the accessories on.
It felt like everybody fit their character.

1138
01:39:12.524 --> 01:39:15.391
Zoe brought a really
wonderful spirit to the role.

1139
01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.994
Dhe wanted to be the manipulator.
Which is correct.

1140
01:39:18.163 --> 01:39:20.723
And. uh. you know.
She's a very smart actress.

1141
01:39:20.899 --> 01:39:22.833
The thing I like about Aisha and Clay...

1142
01:39:23.001 --> 01:39:25.367
is they're attracted to each other
for all the reasons...

1143
01:39:25.537 --> 01:39:28.062
as to why
they shouldn't be hooking up at all.

1144
01:39:28.674 --> 01:39:32.007
They can kill each other at any moment.
They're witty as hell.

1145
01:39:32.177 --> 01:39:36.580
They have trust issues.
And they find each other irresistible.

1146
01:39:36.748 --> 01:39:38.773
I have a business proposition
for you. Clay.

1147
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:42.886
Dhe met with us and she was just
so smart and tough and arrogant.

1148
01:39:43.055 --> 01:39:47.082
AII those things that we expect that
girl to be. she brought all that with her.

1149
01:39:47.259 --> 01:39:50.888
Dhe brought to it a real conviction
that there was something...

1150
01:39:51.063 --> 01:39:53.429
very feminist about it.

1151
01:39:53.598 --> 01:39:56.863
Dhe runs like a deer.
She performs like a ballerina...

1152
01:39:57.035 --> 01:39:59.299
and that is easy to work with
when you're trying to...

1153
01:39:59.471 --> 01:40:03.237
choreograph her tactical movement.

1154
01:40:03.408 --> 01:40:08.869
I've worked with several female actors
and most of the good ones I've had...

1155
01:40:09.047 --> 01:40:11.572
have been dancers.
Dhe's exceptionally good to watch.

1156
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:13.877
Dhe really is. I can't put her
in a bad position.

1157
01:40:14.052 --> 01:40:18.079
What really comes out in this movie
is her really strong physicality...

1158
01:40:18.256 --> 01:40:20.486
and how believable she is.

1159
01:40:20.692 --> 01:40:22.592
Dhe's very good at what she does.

1160
01:40:22.761 --> 01:40:25.286
Just with her natural skills
she comes across as somebody...

1161
01:40:25.464 --> 01:40:27.898
that clearly knows
how to handle a weapon...

1162
01:40:28.066 --> 01:40:30.466
and how to do things
that must be done...

1163
01:40:30.635 --> 01:40:32.626
in situations
that she finds herself in.

1164
01:40:32.804 --> 01:40:35.739
Then you come in here. You know
what I mean? Give me that step into it.

1165
01:40:35.907 --> 01:40:39.775
The scene in the motel.
The fight between Aisha and Clay...

1166
01:40:39.945 --> 01:40:41.503
when it was first brought to us...

1167
01:40:41.713 --> 01:40:45.308
it was supposed to be just this
knock-down. drag-them-out kind of fight.

1168
01:40:45.484 --> 01:40:48.282
But then. fortunately.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan...

1169
01:40:48.453 --> 01:40:51.445
Zoe Daldana and. of course.
Dylvain White. the director...

1170
01:40:51.623 --> 01:40:55.081
came together and said
we wanna bring character out in it.

1171
01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.356
And we created. possibly.
One of the most amazing...

1172
01:40:59.531 --> 01:41:01.260
visceral fights that you'II see.

1173
01:41:01.433 --> 01:41:03.924
But at the same token.
It gets quite steamy.

1174
01:41:06.471 --> 01:41:13.468
There's something really sexy about
a woman kicking the shit out of a man.

1175
01:41:13.645 --> 01:41:17.445
But just a woman that can hold her own
and she's not just running away.

1176
01:41:17.616 --> 01:41:19.106
And she stays with it.

1177
01:41:21.052 --> 01:41:23.020
And we cut.

1178
01:41:23.188 --> 01:41:27.648
This is a three-minute full-on brawl
with a beautiful young woman...

1179
01:41:27.826 --> 01:41:31.887
and. uh. it was really hot.
The flames were real.

1180
01:41:32.063 --> 01:41:33.792
Interesting on a lot of levels.

1181
01:41:33.965 --> 01:41:37.059
The one thing that I loved about how
Garrett designed this fighting scene...

1182
01:41:37.269 --> 01:41:39.260
is that he also made it very playful.

1183
01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:45.633
It's misleading. You think
they're about to hook up and have...

1184
01:41:45.811 --> 01:41:47.836
the steamiest adventure ever...

1185
01:41:48.013 --> 01:41:50.538
and they end up
kicking the crap out of each other.

1186
01:41:50.715 --> 01:41:53.513
But realizing that it's kind of hot.

1187
01:41:53.685 --> 01:41:56.381
And they become business partners
after that.

1188
01:42:00.058 --> 01:42:02.720
Dhe's very strong. very powerful.
Never lets down.

1189
01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:04.691
And that's really who she is
in the graphic.

1190
01:42:04.863 --> 01:42:08.663
And Zoe was really able to breathe
genuine strength into the character.

1191
01:42:14.206 --> 01:42:16.071
Dhut up. Jensen.

1192
01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:28.442
Two. three. four.
