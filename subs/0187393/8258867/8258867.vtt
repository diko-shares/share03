1
00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.944
<i>I have long feared...</i>

2
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.281
<i>...that my sins would return to visit me.</i>

3
00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:16.118
<i>And the cost is more than I can bear.</i>

4
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:46.357
Samuel! A postrider!

5
00:01:57.243 --> 00:01:58.327
An "R."

6
00:01:58.494 --> 00:01:59.954
Good.

7
00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:02.748
What about this one?

8
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.372
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9
00:03:25.623 --> 00:03:28.376
Father! Father!

10
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.422
Nine pounds, 11 ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

11
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.258
Father, a postrider!

12
00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.344
Did you finish planting the field?

13
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:39.720
More than half.

14
00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:43.516
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

15
00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.811
Told you.

16
00:03:57.238 --> 00:03:58.614
Thomas.

17
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.699
Wait for Father.

18
00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:01.177
Sorry.

19
00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:37.505
That's her. The North Star.

20
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.798
See?

21
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:43.719
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

22
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.387
And then you count up.

23
00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:48.807
You count up five finger-lengths...

24
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:52.102
...and it's right there.

25
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.940
And she'll always be looking down on us.

26
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.652
And protect us. Forever.

27
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:03.197
Come. Into bed.

28
00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:12.915
Good night. Good night, Meg.

29
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:17.670
It helps her to know Mother's there.

30
00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:23.551
Good night.

31
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:07.303
So, what was in the mail?

32
00:07:33.704 --> 00:07:35.664
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

33
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:44.506
He's 17, a year younger than I.

34
00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:59.355
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

35
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.774
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

36
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.233
We leave in the morning.

37
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.821
- Aunt Charlotte!
- Aunt Charlotte!

38
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.948
Margaret, William, look at you.

39
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:53.575
Missed you.

40
00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.829
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

41
00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:01.083
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

42
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.838
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.

43
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.507
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

44
00:09:08.674 --> 00:09:11.135
You two, keep an eye
on these heathens, will you?

45
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.553
Thomas!

46
00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:14.596
Sorry.

47
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:26.817
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

48
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.367
She's still not talking?

49
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:37.995
No.

50
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:42.916
It does me good to see you.

51
00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.383
Look, there's Gabriel.

52
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.886
- Gabriel!
- Gabriel!

53
00:09:58.474 --> 00:10:00.851
- Burn him!
- Hang King George!

54
00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.771
Death to King George!

55
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.107
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

56
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.575
My name is Peter Howard.

57
00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:20.245
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

58
00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:24.374
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

59
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.669
And how did King George reward me?

60
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.506
He cuts off my other leg with his taxes.

61
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.218
Miss Howard, isn't it?

62
00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.137
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

63
00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:42.976
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

64
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.395
I believe that was one
of my younger brothers.

65
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.773
Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

66
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.653
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

67
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.363
I...

68
00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:59.660
...and send a message to King George
he will never forget!

69
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.372
Our first order of business...

70
00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:05.415
And our last, if we vote a levy!

71
00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:07.084
Order, order!

72
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:09.336
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

73
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:13.799
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

74
00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:15.801
Colonel Burwell.

75
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.265
You all know why I'm here.

76
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.809
I'm not an orator.

77
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:28.897
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

78
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.650
I'm a soldier.

79
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.361
And we are at war.

80
00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:38.490
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

81
00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:41.827
Eight of the 13 colonies
have levied money...

82
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:44.079
...in support of a Continental Army.

83
00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.915
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

84
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.711
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

85
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.088
...but South Carolina is not!

86
00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:54.423
Hear, hear.

87
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.760
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

88
00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.305
...but for the independence of one nation.

89
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.599
And what nation is that?

90
00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.018
An American nation!

91
00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.812
There is no such nation,
and to speak of one is treason.

92
00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:11.940
We are citizens of an American nation.

93
00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.776
And our rights are being threatened...

94
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.571
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

95
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.282
Would you tell me, please, Mr. Howard...

96
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:24.369
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

97
00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:27.873
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

98
00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:36.673
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

99
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.259
Captain Martin...

100
00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.471
...I understood you to be a patriot.

101
00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:46.600
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry
about taxation without representation?

102
00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:48.310
Well, yes, I am.

103
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:53.482
Should the American colonies
govern themselves independently?

104
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:57.027
I believe they can. And they should.

105
00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:01.114
But if you're asking me
am I willing to go to war with England...

106
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.951
...then the answer is most definitely no.

107
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:12.751
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

108
00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.003
...during the Wilderness campaign?

109
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.256
I was intemperate in my youth.

110
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.300
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.

111
00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:24.054
Mr. Middleton,
I fought with Captain Martin...

112
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.391
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

113
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.226
There's not a man in this room...

114
00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:32.980
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

115
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.773
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear!

116
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.234
There are alternatives to war.

117
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.112
We take our case before the king.

118
00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.780
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

119
00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:44.992
Well, then we try again, and again,
if necessary, to avoid a war.

120
00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.745
Benjamin. I was at Bunker Hill.

121
00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.331
The British advanced three times.

122
00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:55.627
We killed over 700 at point-blank range,
and still they took the ground.

123
00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:59.297
That is the measure of their resolve.

124
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.342
If your principles dictate independence...

125
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.137
...then war is the only way.

126
00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.930
It has come to that.

127
00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.182
Hear, hear!

128
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.936
I have seven children.

129
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.272
My wife is dead.

130
00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.942
Now, who's to care for them if I go to war?

131
00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:24.698
Wars are not fought only
by childless men.

132
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:26.867
Granted.

133
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:31.705
But mark my words.

134
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.586
This war will be fought not
on the frontier...

135
00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:40.797
...or on some distant battlefield...

136
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.425
...but amongst us.

137
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:45.677
Among our homes.

138
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.890
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

139
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.687
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

140
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.318
I will not fight.

141
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.988
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

142
00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:08.033
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

143
00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:12.079
And your principles?

144
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:19.127
I'm a parent.
I haven't got the luxury of principles.

145
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.888
We must vote to levy!

146
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.655
Twenty-eight to 12! The levy passed!

147
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.728
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

148
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:21.064
Yes, I do.

149
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.657
Father, I thought
you were a man of principle.

150
00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:37.873
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

151
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:43.587
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

152
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.899
He's as imprudent
as his father was at his age.

153
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.067
Regrettably so.

154
00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.488
I'll see to it that he serves under me.

155
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:15.702
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

156
00:17:17.954 --> 00:17:19.623
Good luck.

157
00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.358
<i>Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons...</i>

158
00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:48.568
<i>...have passed,
it seems like only yesterday...</i>

159
00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:51.488
<i>...when we last saw each other
in Charles Town.</i>

160
00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:54.950
<i>With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...</i>

161
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.494
<i>...under General Cornwallis.</i>

162
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.208
<i>I received a letter from Aunt Charlotte...</i>

163
00:18:03.375 --> 00:18:06.378
<i>...saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...</i>

164
00:18:06.962 --> 00:18:10.215
<i>...and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.</i>

165
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:24.771
<i>Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.</i>

166
00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:28.900
<i>Our losses have been grievous.</i>

167
00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:39.703
<i>My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at Elizabethtown.</i>

168
00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:42.580
No!

169
00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.337
<i>His death has been difficult to bear.</i>

170
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.144
<i>We will march south
with General Gates...</i>

171
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:07.439
<i>...to fight the redcoats under Cornwallis.</i>

172
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.192
Thank you, sir.

173
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:18.533
Easy, Red. Easy.

174
00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:24.914
Come back!

175
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:26.624
<i>I envy you...</i>

176
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.502
<i>...your youth and your distance
from this cruel conflict...</i>

177
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.796
..."of which I am a part.

178
00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.550
But I am fortunate to be serving
the cause of liberty.

179
00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.054
And though I fear death...

180
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.931
...each day in prayer
I reaffirm my willingness...

181
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.726
...to give my life in its service.

182
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:46.519
Pray for me.

183
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.774
But above all, pray for the cause.

184
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.777
Your loving brother, Gabriel."

185
00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:30.772
What are you doing?

186
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.280
Turn around.

187
00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.829
Not yet, Thomas.

188
00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.288
When?

189
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.461
Seventeen.

190
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:57.882
That's two years. It's already been two.

191
00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:01.261
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

192
00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:08.393
All right. Seventeen.

193
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.064
All right.

194
00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.157
Put it back, please.

195
00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.037
Father?

196
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:31.249
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

197
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.004
Put it away.

198
00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:06.951
Six-pounders. Lots of them.

199
00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:09.245
How far away?

200
00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:14.209
They're a long way off. They're
most likely heading the other direction.

201
00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.921
Put those in the house.

202
00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:20.465
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

203
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:27.263
Let's all stay close in
to the house tonight, all right?

204
00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.493
We'll have to fight them off.

205
00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:50.537
Won't Father do that?

206
00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:54.040
They'll probably kill us men...

207
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.086
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

208
00:22:58.253 --> 00:23:00.046
Nathan!

209
00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:27.699
Slowly turn.

210
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.454
Father.

211
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.500
Abigale!

212
00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:39.460
Water and bandages, fast.

213
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.551
- Easy.
- The battle. Were you there?

214
00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.386
Have you seen any redcoats?

215
00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:50.430
No, not yet.

216
00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:53.016
Abigale, the children, please.

217
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:55.852
Children, come. Upstairs.

218
00:24:01.274 --> 00:24:03.735
Gates marched us straight
at the redcoats.

219
00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:07.655
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

220
00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:10.283
I was given these dispatches.

221
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.704
As I left,
I saw the Virginia Regulars surrender.

222
00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:19.834
The Dragoons rode into them.

223
00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:22.170
Killed them all.

224
00:24:23.546 --> 00:24:25.548
Over 200 men.

225
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:29.636
- I have to get these to Hillsborough.
- You can't ride.

226
00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:32.764
I can't stay here! It's not safe for...

227
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.833
Fire!

228
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:06.881
Fire!

229
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:16.683
Fire!

230
00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:54.721
Get it to stop there.

231
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:58.785
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

232
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:33.027
Have a detachment take our wounded
to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

233
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:35.071
Yes, sir.

234
00:27:36.447 --> 00:27:37.657
Fire the house and barns.

235
00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:43.287
Let it be known, if you harbor the enemy,
you will lose your home.

236
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:49.252
By standing order of King George...

237
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:53.005
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

238
00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:56.133
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

239
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.802
Sir.

240
00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:02.098
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

241
00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:05.226
Then you're freedmen
who will have the privilege...

242
00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:07.770
...of fighting in the king's army,
aren't you?

243
00:28:13.693 --> 00:28:16.028
Rebel dispatches, sir.

244
00:28:21.951 --> 00:28:23.286
Who carried this?

245
00:28:32.587 --> 00:28:33.713
Who carried this?!

246
00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:35.715
I did, sir.

247
00:28:42.555 --> 00:28:44.557
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

248
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.227
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

249
00:28:50.897 --> 00:28:52.857
Take this one to Camden. He is a spy.

250
00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:55.526
Hang him, put his body on display.

251
00:28:55.693 --> 00:28:57.612
He's a dispatch rider.
That's a marked case.

252
00:28:57.778 --> 00:29:00.990
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

253
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:05.161
Colonel, this is a uniformed dispatch rider
carrying a marked case.

254
00:29:05.328 --> 00:29:06.621
He cannot be held as a spy.

255
00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:09.457
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

256
00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:14.587
- Colonel...
- Father.

257
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:20.968
Oh, I see. He's your son.

258
00:29:22.053 --> 00:29:25.348
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

259
00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:28.643
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.

260
00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:30.436
By the rules of war...

261
00:29:30.603 --> 00:29:34.523
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

262
00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:38.861
Or perhaps your children would.

263
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.534
No lesson is necessary.

264
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:49.747
Sir.

265
00:29:49.914 --> 00:29:52.249
What of the rebel wounded?

266
00:29:54.168 --> 00:29:55.503
Kill them.

267
00:30:00.383 --> 00:30:01.884
Father.

268
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:08.724
- Father, do something!
- Be quiet.

269
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.322
- Gabriel, run!
- Thomas!

270
00:30:24.657 --> 00:30:26.075
Wait!

271
00:30:28.452 --> 00:30:29.495
No!

272
00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:36.085
No!

273
00:30:36.252 --> 00:30:38.796
No! Thomas!

274
00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.357
Stupid boy.

275
00:31:03.946 --> 00:31:05.406
Captain.

276
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.662
Thomas!

277
00:32:07.134 --> 00:32:08.803
Come, child.

278
00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:12.765
- Abigale!
- I'm not leaving these children!

279
00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:15.559
- Mercy!
- Mercy, sir.

280
00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:17.186
Get ready!

281
00:32:17.353 --> 00:32:19.605
Present! Fire!

282
00:32:20.356 --> 00:32:23.567
Get ready! Present! Fire!

283
00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:05.276
All of you, stay here.

284
00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:42.188
Nathan, Samuel.

285
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:48.444
Margaret.

286
00:33:50.613 --> 00:33:53.199
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

287
00:33:53.365 --> 00:33:56.160
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

288
00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:57.912
Is that clear?

289
00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:00.664
Boys.

290
00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:55.094
It's a good spot.

291
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:58.973
Boys, listen to me.

292
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:01.016
I'll fire first.

293
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:05.854
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

294
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:08.983
- Can you tell the difference?
- Yes, Father.

295
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:10.985
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

296
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:14.154
Samuel, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

297
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:16.323
Now...

298
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.326
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

299
00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:21.203
Run as quickly as you can.

300
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.831
Get your brother and your sisters...

301
00:35:23.998 --> 00:35:27.042
...and take them to Aunt Charlotte's.
Understood?

302
00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:29.920
What did I say about shooting?

303
00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:31.839
Aim small, miss small.

304
00:35:32.298 --> 00:35:34.341
Aim small, miss small.

305
00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:36.719
Boys...

306
00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:38.429
...Samuel...

307
00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:40.097
...steady.

308
00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:30.022
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

309
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.942
Aim small, miss small.

310
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:36.862
Aim small, miss small.

311
00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:39.740
Aim small, miss small.

312
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:55.172
- On the right!
- To the left!

313
00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:03.430
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

314
00:37:07.851 --> 00:37:09.228
Form right!

315
00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:12.231
- To the right!
- To the right!

316
00:37:13.607 --> 00:37:15.651
About face!

317
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.445
Attention!

318
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:20.155
On the right to the rear!

319
00:37:20.948 --> 00:37:22.324
To the right!

320
00:37:23.117 --> 00:37:24.159
Fire!

321
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:27.621
- Reload!
- Reload!

322
00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.058
Behind you!

323
00:37:53.063 --> 00:37:54.648
Look on the rear!

324
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.694
To the rear!

325
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:15.974
Sir. We have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

326
00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:19.186
Private?

327
00:41:19.353 --> 00:41:20.520
Private.

328
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:22.689
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

329
00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:25.859
What happened? Who did this?

330
00:41:26.777 --> 00:41:28.320
Him.

331
00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:30.989
It was mad.

332
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.116
I couldn't tell you who it was.

333
00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:35.410
Calm down. Calm down, man.

334
00:41:36.036 --> 00:41:38.872
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

335
00:41:39.039 --> 00:41:41.541
And I need to know how.

336
00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:44.086
- He said there was...
- Were you there?

337
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:46.838
Then let him speak.

338
00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:50.509
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

339
00:41:50.676 --> 00:41:52.594
Were they militia? Were they Regulars?

340
00:41:53.095 --> 00:41:55.806
I don't really remember how many.

341
00:41:57.808 --> 00:41:58.892
Maybe one.

342
00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:03.814
One man. Really?

343
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.024
He was in the flank.

344
00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:08.985
All around us.

345
00:42:09.152 --> 00:42:11.113
Amongst us.

346
00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:13.865
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

347
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.992
What, he just vanished?

348
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.454
- Sounds more like a ghost than a man.
- Yes.

349
00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:21.456
A ghost.

350
00:42:22.541 --> 00:42:24.543
He was like a ghost.

351
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:27.421
Enough.

352
00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:32.134
Bordon? Take a patrol.

353
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.345
Capture this ghost
before word of his exploits spread.

354
00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:38.473
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

355
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.144
He was with the Loyalist Colonial Militia.
He might be of use.

356
00:42:42.644 --> 00:42:44.479
Another colonial.

357
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:47.482
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

358
00:42:47.649 --> 00:42:48.734
To king and country.

359
00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:51.611
Why should I trust a man
who'd betray his neighbors?

360
00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:55.490
Those neighbors of mine
who stand against England...

361
00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:57.325
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

362
00:42:58.452 --> 00:42:59.494
We'll see.

363
00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:07.753
Mr. Martin.

364
00:43:13.592 --> 00:43:15.343
Miss Charlotte! Miss Charlotte!

365
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.775
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

366
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.318
Good night.

367
00:43:31.485 --> 00:43:32.694
Good night.

368
00:43:33.361 --> 00:43:34.696
Father?

369
00:43:34.863 --> 00:43:36.156
Yes.

370
00:43:37.032 --> 00:43:39.242
I killed those men.

371
00:43:40.452 --> 00:43:41.870
You did what I told you to do.

372
00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:46.750
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

373
00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:51.338
I'm glad I killed them.

374
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:56.593
I'm glad.

375
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:07.604
Get some rest.

376
00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:16.488
Samuel.

377
00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:41.096
You've done nothing
for which you should be ashamed.

378
00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:44.474
I've done nothing.

379
00:44:45.851 --> 00:44:48.311
And for that, I am ashamed.

380
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:09.332
Gates and the Continental Army
are at Hillsborough.

381
00:45:09.499 --> 00:45:10.792
I'm joining up with them.

382
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:14.379
Gabriel.

383
00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:18.258
No, no. Your place is here now.

384
00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:20.594
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

385
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:23.513
Your duty is to your family.

386
00:45:25.181 --> 00:45:27.142
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

387
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:30.645
- I'll find you when it's over.
- No, I forbid you to go!

388
00:45:30.812 --> 00:45:33.690
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

389
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:37.444
Goodbye, Father.

390
00:45:38.737 --> 00:45:40.405
Gabriel.

391
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:43.033
Thomas is dead.

392
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:46.119
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

393
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:18.568
I'm losing my family.

394
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.074
When will you be back, Father?

395
00:46:25.075 --> 00:46:26.743
I don't know.

396
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.203
Tomorrow?

397
00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:30.664
No, not tomorrow.

398
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.666
You say your prayers.

399
00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:34.250
I will.

400
00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:38.380
Nathan, take care of your brothers
and sisters and your Aunt Charlotte.

401
00:46:38.755 --> 00:46:40.757
I'm depending on you.

402
00:46:41.466 --> 00:46:43.718
As I am on you, Samuel.

403
00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:46.346
All right.

404
00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.354
Susan...

405
00:46:56.439 --> 00:46:57.983
...goodbye.

406
00:47:12.455 --> 00:47:13.999
Thank you.

407
00:49:21.835 --> 00:49:23.419
Halt!

408
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:29.092
Make ready!

409
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.557
Take aim!

410
00:49:40.145 --> 00:49:41.354
Fire!

411
00:49:53.366 --> 00:49:55.368
I'm not going back.

412
00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:58.329
No, I didn't expect you would.

413
00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:05.295
That Gates is a damn fool.

414
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.299
He spent too many years
in the British army.

415
00:50:09.465 --> 00:50:13.553
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

416
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.638
Halt!

417
00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:17.599
Make ready!

418
00:50:18.183 --> 00:50:20.602
Present!

419
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.812
Fire!

420
00:50:45.126 --> 00:50:48.004
This battle was over before it began.

421
00:50:57.472 --> 00:50:59.224
Retreat!

422
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.726
Retreat!

423
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:10.985
These rustics are so inept.

424
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:13.613
Nearly takes the honor out of victory.

425
00:51:14.489 --> 00:51:15.698
Nearly.

426
00:51:21.246 --> 00:51:23.206
- Hold him firm.
- Ready.

427
00:51:23.373 --> 00:51:24.832
Hold him down.

428
00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:27.377
Cut his breeches. Give me the bone saw.

429
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:44.060
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

430
00:51:50.233 --> 00:51:52.235
It's a lost cause.

431
00:52:08.793 --> 00:52:10.461
Benjamin Martin.

432
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:12.588
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

433
00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:15.174
Where's your General Gates now?

434
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:19.762
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

435
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:22.849
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

436
00:52:23.725 --> 00:52:25.435
So who's in command?

437
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.687
I am.

438
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:30.231
I think.

439
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:32.275
What are my orders?

440
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:40.408
We're a breath away
from losing this war, Benjamin.

441
00:52:43.244 --> 00:52:46.331
In the north, Washington is reeling
from Morristown.

442
00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:49.208
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 redcoats.

443
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:52.128
In the south,
Cornwallis has broken our back.

444
00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:55.423
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

445
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:59.135
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

446
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:03.973
Nothing will stop him from heading north
to finish off Washington.

447
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.061
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

448
00:53:09.187 --> 00:53:11.981
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

449
00:53:12.148 --> 00:53:13.191
When?

450
00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:17.445
Six months at the earliest.

451
00:53:17.612 --> 00:53:20.531
You actually trust the French
to keep their word?

452
00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:26.579
Benjamin Martin. Major Jean Villeneuve.

453
00:53:26.746 --> 00:53:29.415
French Seventh Light Foot.
Here to help train the militia.

454
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:33.669
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

455
00:53:38.508 --> 00:53:41.677
You really expect to hold Cornwallis here
using just militia?

456
00:53:41.844 --> 00:53:44.138
Not me. You.

457
00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:48.726
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.

458
00:53:48.893 --> 00:53:51.521
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

459
00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:54.107
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

460
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:57.193
How many men does Cornwallis have?

461
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.779
Eight thousand infantry.

462
00:53:59.946 --> 00:54:02.407
Around 600 cavalry.

463
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:05.076
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

464
00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:08.454
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

465
00:54:08.621 --> 00:54:09.956
- Sir, no, I...
- No.

466
00:54:10.123 --> 00:54:11.457
It's done.

467
00:54:14.961 --> 00:54:16.629
Thank you.

468
00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:20.091
Colonel, I've been a soldier for two years.

469
00:54:20.258 --> 00:54:22.802
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

470
00:54:22.969 --> 00:54:25.430
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better service with Regulars.

471
00:54:25.596 --> 00:54:27.932
Where'd you learn all that riding,
shooting, scavenging?

472
00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:30.143
My father taught me.

473
00:54:31.686 --> 00:54:33.271
Teach you any humility?

474
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.648
He tried. It didn't take.

475
00:54:37.024 --> 00:54:40.653
He also taught you every trail
between here and Charles Town...

476
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.613
...which is why he transferred you.

477
00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.992
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...

478
00:54:46.159 --> 00:54:48.661
We'll cover more ground if we split up.

479
00:54:51.998 --> 00:54:55.585
Very well, corporal. You take Harrisville,
Pembroke, Wakefield.

480
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:59.088
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

481
00:54:59.255 --> 00:55:00.840
Yes, sir.

482
00:55:03.843 --> 00:55:05.303
Corporal.

483
00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:08.514
Be careful.

484
00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:12.101
Yes, sir.

485
00:55:16.689 --> 00:55:18.524
You have children?

486
00:55:22.904 --> 00:55:24.280
The French.

487
00:55:48.346 --> 00:55:50.264
It skirts the mountain and then...

488
00:55:50.431 --> 00:55:52.808
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

489
00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:56.812
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

490
00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:58.231
It's 100,000 acres.

491
00:55:58.397 --> 00:56:00.775
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

492
00:56:00.942 --> 00:56:03.861
You will be a country unto yourself.

493
00:56:07.323 --> 00:56:08.991
His Majesty is most generous.

494
00:56:11.786 --> 00:56:15.957
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

495
00:56:16.624 --> 00:56:21.379
Yes, this is how
His Majesty rewards those...

496
00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:23.756
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

497
00:56:23.923 --> 00:56:26.300
I dare to presume
my own meager contributions...

498
00:56:26.467 --> 00:56:28.010
...will be rewarded one day.

499
00:56:28.177 --> 00:56:30.555
You may presume too much.

500
00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:34.433
His Majesty, like history, judges us
not only by the outcome of the war...

501
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.186
...but the manner in which it was fought.

502
00:56:37.353 --> 00:56:38.896
- My lord?
- We serve the Crown...

503
00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:41.607
...and we must conduct
ourselves accordingly.

504
00:56:41.774 --> 00:56:43.734
Surrendering troops will be given quarter.

505
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:46.279
These brutal tactics must stop!

506
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:49.448
Is it not enough
that I have never lost a battle?

507
00:56:49.615 --> 00:56:50.783
You serve me...

508
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:55.580
...and the manner
in which you serve me reflects upon me!

509
00:56:56.372 --> 00:57:00.001
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

510
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:01.586
...would understand that.

511
00:57:03.713 --> 00:57:06.549
My late father squandered
any esteem in which we were held...

512
00:57:06.716 --> 00:57:08.884
...along with my inheritance.

513
00:57:12.013 --> 00:57:14.599
I advance myself only through victory.

514
00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:18.144
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

515
00:57:19.895 --> 00:57:21.939
These colonials are our brethren.

516
00:57:22.106 --> 00:57:27.320
And when this conflict is over,
we will reestablish commerce with them.

517
00:57:27.486 --> 00:57:29.488
Do you understand, colonel?

518
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:32.867
Perfectly, my lord.

519
00:58:15.368 --> 00:58:18.371
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.

520
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:21.707
Young man, this is a house of God.

521
00:58:22.333 --> 00:58:25.252
I understand that, Reverend. I apologize.

522
00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:30.007
The South Carolina militia
is being called up.

523
00:58:30.174 --> 00:58:32.009
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

524
00:58:33.427 --> 00:58:34.470
Son...

525
00:58:35.054 --> 00:58:36.931
...we are here to pray...

526
00:58:37.098 --> 00:58:39.934
...for the souls
of those men hanging outside.

527
00:58:40.101 --> 00:58:42.103
Yes, pray for them.

528
00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:44.480
But honor them
by taking up arms with us.

529
00:58:46.399 --> 00:58:48.401
And bring more suffering to this town?

530
00:58:48.818 --> 00:58:54.073
If King George can hang those men,
our friends, he can hang any one of us.

531
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.741
Dan Scott...

532
00:58:55.908 --> 00:58:59.412
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

533
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:03.332
- Anne?
- Mr. Hardwick...

534
00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:07.795
...how many times have I heard you
speak of freedom at my father's table?

535
00:59:09.088 --> 00:59:12.383
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

536
00:59:13.676 --> 00:59:15.761
...and you, Reverend...

537
00:59:15.928 --> 00:59:18.848
...are as ardent patriots as I.

538
00:59:23.561 --> 00:59:28.399
Will you now, when you are
needed most, stop at only words?

539
00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:30.317
Is that the sort of men you are?

540
00:59:39.952 --> 00:59:42.288
I ask only that you act upon the beliefs...

541
00:59:42.455 --> 00:59:45.708
...of which you have so strongly spoken...

542
00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:49.628
...and in which you so strongly believe.

543
01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:03.267
Who's with us?

544
01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:05.246
Promise me, don't do...

545
01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.956
Mr. Howard?

546
01:01:07.373 --> 01:01:10.709
Sir, may I have permission
to write to Anne?

547
01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:17.800
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

548
01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.553
You have permission...

549
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.805
...to write me.

550
01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:25.975
- Oh, write her.
- Yes, sir.

551
01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:28.185
Very well.

552
01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.438
Thank you, sir.

553
01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:35.150
Reverend?

554
01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:44.326
A shepherd must tend his flock.

555
01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:48.414
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

556
01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:30.789
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

557
01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:39.423
God save King George!

558
01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:01.111
I think we came to the right place.

559
01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.621
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

560
01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:13.207
But you can keep
or sell me the muskets and gear...

561
01:03:13.374 --> 01:03:15.334
...of any redcoat you kill.

562
01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:29.974
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

563
01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:33.227
Every damned one of them redcoats
deserves to die.

564
01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:34.979
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

565
01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:38.148
...I wouldn't make it
through the first skirmish. No, sir.

566
01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.360
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

567
01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:43.696
Occam! Get over here.

568
01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:48.033
Ain't overly smart. He's strong as a bull.

569
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.326
Can you write?

570
01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:52.287
No, no, no, sir.

571
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.081
- Well, then make your mark.
- Why?

572
01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.333
I just signed him over to you.

573
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.627
If you're willing, make your mark.

574
01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:06.427
That'll do.

575
01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:13.475
I wanna kill me some redcoats.

576
01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:15.769
I believe you would.

577
01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:17.354
How old are you, son?

578
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:20.232
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

579
01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.901
John Billings. I was hoping you'd turn up.

580
01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.571
There's a story going around
about 20 redcoats...

581
01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:28.532
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

582
01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:30.284
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

583
01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.831
Aren't you a little old
to be believing in ghost stories?

584
01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.064
Look at the little gentleman.

585
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.108
- Where are your mothers?
- Doesn't even shave!

586
01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:44.775
- How many did you get?
- Twelve.

587
01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.610
Good.

588
01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:50.989
These men, they're not the sort we need.

589
01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.453
They're exactly the sort we need.

590
01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:59.623
They've fought this kind of war before.

591
01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:04.920
What about me? Am I one of that sort?

592
01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:09.299
Hell, no. You're the sort
that gives that sort a bad name.

593
01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:18.433
I want accuracy and precision.

594
01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:19.977
Make ready!

595
01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.608
Take aim!

596
01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:32.781
Fire!

597
01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:15.949
<i>Dear Anne:
Our force continues to grow.</i>

598
01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:20.579
<i>As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.</i>

599
01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:23.874
<i>I long to see you and speak to you.</i>

600
01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.668
<i>I'm hopeful
that our duties will bring me near you.</i>

601
01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:31.131
</i>Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.<i>

602
01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:32.341
<i>Gabriel.</i>

603
01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.196
- Come!
- Retreat!

604
01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:57.366
Through the woods!

605
01:07:58.951 --> 01:08:00.702
We surrender!

606
01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:03.872
- No!
- God, stop!

607
01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:06.583
For the love of God, we...

608
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.377
These men were about to surrender!

609
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.838
Perhaps.

610
01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.508
- We will never know.
- This is murder!

611
01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:18.720
Hell, Reverend, they're redcoats.
They've earned it.

612
01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.517
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

613
01:08:23.684 --> 01:08:25.602
I know the difference
between fighting...

614
01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:27.479
Go back to church!

615
01:08:27.646 --> 01:08:29.273
Quiet!

616
01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:32.484
He's right.

617
01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:36.488
Full quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

618
01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:38.991
They gave no quarter
when they fired on a ship...

619
01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:41.201
...carrying my wife and daughters.

620
01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:44.746
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

621
01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.917
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

622
01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:51.670
Who are you to give such an order?

623
01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:55.299
I know what you did to my countrymen
at Fort Wilderness.

624
01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:01.638
We're militia. This is not Regular Army.

625
01:09:02.306 --> 01:09:04.891
Every man here is free
to come and go as he pleases.

626
01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.351
But while you're here...

627
01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:09.021
...you will obey my command,
or I will have you shot.

628
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.154
- Damn dog.
- Shoot the damn things.

629
01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:18.822
Stay that pistol.

630
01:09:18.989 --> 01:09:21.033
They won't let you near the wagon.

631
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.790
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

632
01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.208
Officers' uniforms.

633
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.586
What you think all this is worth?

634
01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:37.424
It's the personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

635
01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.386
This is his journal.

636
01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:43.430
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs...

637
01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:46.099
...and use the papers
for musket wadding.

638
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:47.601
Eat the dogs?

639
01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:50.687
- Yeah.
- Dog is a fine meal.

640
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:53.231
Good heavens.

641
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.580
I have some maps here for you, sir.

642
01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:12.417
Put them down over there. Thank you.

643
01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.921
Here. A proper musket for you.

644
01:10:16.088 --> 01:10:20.133
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea of giving muskets to slaves.

645
01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:26.306
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

646
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.772
Don't listen to them.

647
01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:38.318
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

648
01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:40.695
What will change?

649
01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:47.077
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

650
01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:52.290
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

651
01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:59.923
A world where all men
are created equal under God.

652
01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.633
Equal.

653
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.803
Sounds good.

654
01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:08.640
I've just been in the mind of a genius.

655
01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.686
Cornwallis knows more about warfare...

656
01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:15.564
...than we could learn
in a dozen lifetimes.

657
01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.399
That's cheerful news.

658
01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:22.529
His victories at Camden
and Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

659
01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:25.365
And he knows it, what's more.

660
01:11:27.409 --> 01:11:28.827
Perhaps that's his weakness.

661
01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:30.871
Sir?

662
01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.290
Pride.

663
01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.542
Pride's a weakness.

664
01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:39.004
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

665
01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.674
Pride will do.

666
01:11:53.477 --> 01:11:55.604
Finished, my lord.

667
01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.856
I've taken it in at the back...

668
01:11:58.023 --> 01:12:00.775
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

669
01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:03.778
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

670
01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.740
It's really quite nice.

671
01:12:06.907 --> 01:12:10.076
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

672
01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:14.456
Colonel Tavington, why, after six weeks...

673
01:12:14.623 --> 01:12:17.959
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

674
01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:20.670
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

675
01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.380
First, the theft of my baggage...

676
01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:25.467
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

677
01:12:25.634 --> 01:12:27.636
Then half the bridges and ferries...

678
01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.429
...between here
and Charles Town burned.

679
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:32.891
If you can't protect
our supply lines against militia...

680
01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:36.436
...how do you intend doing so
against the Regulars or the French?

681
01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:38.897
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

682
01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:42.359
Colonel, they're militia.

683
01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.903
They're farmers with pitchforks!

684
01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:48.323
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid, my lord.

685
01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:51.493
Made so by their commander, this ghost.

686
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.913
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

687
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.749
You created this ghost, colonel.

688
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.335
- My lord?
- Your brutality swelled his ranks.

689
01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:02.796
Without them,
this ghost would've disappeared...

690
01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:07.008
- ...and I'd be in North Carolina by now.
- In my defense, my lord...

691
01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:09.219
Oh, enough, enough.

692
01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:13.932
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

693
01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:18.853
- Give me the horse blanket.
- My lord.

694
01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:23.567
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

695
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.652
Yes, my lord, it has.

696
01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:28.321
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

697
01:13:28.488 --> 01:13:31.408
Your replacement wardrobe
is aboard ship, but...

698
01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:35.829
...Colonel Tavington thought it best
to secure our arms and munitions first.

699
01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:38.290
They are being unloaded now.

700
01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:50.176
You look good in that color.

701
01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.847
It stinks.

702
01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:57.434
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

703
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:59.519
The beasts took your dogs as well?

704
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.063
Yes. Yes.

705
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:05.775
Fine animals. A gift from His Majesty.

706
01:14:06.318 --> 01:14:07.819
Dead now, for all I know.

707
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.572
Is there no decency?

708
01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:23.793
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

709
01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:56.993
Mr. Howard.

710
01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.372
I've come to call on Anne.

711
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.089
I've come to call on Anne!

712
01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:11.466
Well, of course you call yourself a man.

713
01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:16.179
Father, stop it. You heard him.

714
01:15:18.306 --> 01:15:19.349
Well...

715
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.893
...call on her.

716
01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:48.712
I'm nearly finished.

717
01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.257
You needn't worry, Father.

718
01:15:52.424 --> 01:15:54.300
Yeah, I know.

719
01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:58.304
Bundling bags are a wonderful tradition.
I don't mind in the least.

720
01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.933
Be still.

721
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:03.435
Tea?

722
01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.062
Please.

723
01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:08.523
There.

724
01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.613
Okay.

725
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:18.700
Come, dear.

726
01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:31.713
It's very good.

727
01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.926
I'm pleased that you like it.

728
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.145
Peter.

729
01:16:47.312 --> 01:16:51.232
Don't worry.
I sew better than my mother did.

730
01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.862
I hope so.

731
01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:05.830
If you're just gonna stand there,
why don't you read it for us?

732
01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:07.540
I can't read.

733
01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:12.003
I can.

734
01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.633
It says, "Take notice.

735
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.386
By order of General Washington
and the Continental Congress...

736
01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.807
...all bound slaves
who give minimum one-year service...

737
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.475
...in the Continental Army...

738
01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.353
...will be granted freedom...

739
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.774
...and be paid a bounty of 5 shillings
for each month of service."

740
01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:34.692
Did you hear that?

741
01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:37.111
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

742
01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:40.740
Only another six months.

743
01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.119
What the hell you gonna do
with freedom?

744
01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:58.341
I made this for you.

745
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.228
Martha.

746
01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.818
Look after your mother.

747
01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:23.700
You know, Peter...

748
01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.702
...I can't pay you for this.

749
01:18:25.869 --> 01:18:30.373
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

750
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.250
I'm obliged.

751
01:18:33.293 --> 01:18:36.671
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

752
01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:40.049
No, no, no, he's more like his mother.

753
01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:43.177
Corporal.

754
01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:46.389
Take your time. Dogs.

755
01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:05.283
Sir.

756
01:19:51.162 --> 01:19:53.247
This road is closed.

757
01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:55.667
These wagons now belong
to the Continental Army.

758
01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:59.045
Ready arms!

759
01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:12.850
By twos!

760
01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:25.446
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

761
01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.740
This is the king's highway.

762
01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:30.868
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

763
01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:34.038
Present!

764
01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:38.918
Charge!

765
01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.045
Fire!

766
01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.756
Retreat!

767
01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:45.508
- Fire!
- Fire!

768
01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.140
Save yourselves!

769
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.150
Fire!

770
01:21:06.696 --> 01:21:08.197
Help!

771
01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.378
Retreat!

772
01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.099
Present! Fire!

773
01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:42.565
Ambush! Ambush!

774
01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.418
We surrender!

775
01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:18.059
I have the count.

776
01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:21.104
Twenty-two are dead.

777
01:22:21.521 --> 01:22:25.817
- Eighteen wounded and 20 are missing.
- I'm through.

778
01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.157
He won't be the last to leave.

779
01:22:33.825 --> 01:22:36.119
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

780
01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.329
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.

781
01:22:38.496 --> 01:22:41.457
- And to hell with the French army.
- We don't need them.

782
01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:44.752
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

783
01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:00.643
Father.

784
01:23:01.269 --> 01:23:03.020
Wherever you go, men buy you drinks...

785
01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:05.982
...because of what happened
at Fort Wilderness.

786
01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:11.112
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

787
01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.907
Tell me what happened.

788
01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:20.746
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

789
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.085
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

790
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:36.262
The French and the Cherokee
had raided along the Blue Ridge.

791
01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:39.599
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

792
01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:43.269
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

793
01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:47.064
They'd left about a week before.

794
01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:51.068
But what we found was...

795
01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.031
Go on.

796
01:23:57.867 --> 01:24:01.829
They'd killed all the settlers, the men.

797
01:24:03.456 --> 01:24:05.291
With the women and...

798
01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:08.127
...some of the children, they had...

799
01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:14.008
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

800
01:24:16.427 --> 01:24:19.347
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

801
01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:23.809
We took our time.

802
01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:29.398
We cut them apart. Slowly.

803
01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:31.776
Piece by piece.

804
01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.158
I can see their faces.

805
01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:44.705
I can still hear their screams.

806
01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:50.044
All but two. We let them live.

807
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.214
We placed the heads on a pallet...

808
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:56.133
...sent them back with the two
that lived to Fort Ambercon.

809
01:24:56.884 --> 01:25:00.221
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

810
01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:02.473
...we put in baskets.

811
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.685
Sent them down the Ashuelot
to the Cherokee.

812
01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:11.399
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

813
01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:16.320
That's how we justified it.

814
01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.706
We were...

815
01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.709
...heroes.

816
01:25:31.836 --> 01:25:34.297
And men bought you drinks.

817
01:25:38.718 --> 01:25:42.972
And not a day goes by where I don't
ask God's forgiveness for what I did.

818
01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:54.942
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

819
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:59.488
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

820
01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:03.242
But not at the expense of our cause.

821
01:26:04.452 --> 01:26:07.163
There will be a time for revenge.

822
01:26:08.039 --> 01:26:10.666
But until then, stay the course.

823
01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:15.921
Your mother said that
when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

824
01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:18.966
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

825
01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.265
I miss him.

826
01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:45.993
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

827
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.997
They'll be hung one at a time
until they give up the rest of us.

828
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.305
Reverend...

829
01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:08.766
...can you write a letter for me?

830
01:27:08.933 --> 01:27:11.560
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

831
01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:14.647
But first let us pray.

832
01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:30.621
<i>My lord...</i>

833
01:27:30.788 --> 01:27:32.706
...there is a rider at the gates.

834
01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:35.835
A civilian carrying a white flag.

835
01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.545
I am occupied.

836
01:27:38.129 --> 01:27:40.423
He has a pair of dogs with him.

837
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:43.843
Great Danes.

838
01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:45.511
<i>And dear Lord...</i>

839
01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:48.055
...protect us in this, our hour of need.

840
01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:51.934
This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...

841
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:53.811
And the Holy Ghost.

842
01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:00.234
<i>Wait here.</i>

843
01:28:00.401 --> 01:28:02.820
General Lord Cornwallis
will be with you shortly.

844
01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:50.701
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys. Come.

845
01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:53.120
Come.

846
01:28:56.665 --> 01:29:00.503
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well-fed.

847
01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:04.089
I thank you for that.

848
01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:06.842
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

849
01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:11.222
I'm a colonel with the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

850
01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:13.974
As you wish.

851
01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:15.684
Please be seated.

852
01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:17.311
Thank you.

853
01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:22.441
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

854
01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:26.028
I will, unless you'd like
to claim aggrieved status.

855
01:29:26.195 --> 01:29:28.739
Yes, I would like
to claim aggrieved status.

856
01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:30.866
Very well, sir. Proceed.

857
01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.451
You have in your possession...

858
01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:35.579
...certain belongings of mine,
including clothing...

859
01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:39.333
...furniture, personal effects
of a non-military nature...

860
01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:41.710
...which I'd like returned to me.

861
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:44.880
Indeed. I will do so as soon as possible.

862
01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.758
Thank you.

863
01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:51.053
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

864
01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.222
...of officers during engagements.

865
01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:56.892
You must know that in civilized warfare,
officers in the field...

866
01:29:57.059 --> 01:30:01.397
...must not be accorded
inappropriate levels of hostile attention.

867
01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:06.068
To your mind, what are appropriate levels
of hostile attention?

868
01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.362
Imagine the utter chaos
that would follow...

869
01:30:08.529 --> 01:30:12.199
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

870
01:30:12.366 --> 01:30:15.536
There must be gentlemen
in command to lead...

871
01:30:15.703 --> 01:30:19.164
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

872
01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:24.253
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

873
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:28.841
That's a separate issue.

874
01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:31.343
No, no, no. I consider them linked.

875
01:30:31.719 --> 01:30:34.388
And as long
as your soldiers attack civilians...

876
01:30:34.555 --> 01:30:37.683
...I will order the shooting of officers
at every engagement.

877
01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:42.688
And my men are excellent marksmen.

878
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.943
Very well.

879
01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.488
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.

880
01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:53.699
Sir?

881
01:30:53.866 --> 01:30:57.870
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

882
01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:02.166
My lord...

883
01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:09.256
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

884
01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:12.468
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

885
01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:15.679
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

886
01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:17.973
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.

887
01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.183
My officers?

888
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.809
Sir.

889
01:31:28.025 --> 01:31:30.944
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Just below the tree line.

890
01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.794
- Their names and ranks?
- They refused to give their names.

891
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.672
There are nine lieutenants,
five captains, three majors...

892
01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.590
...and one fat colonel who called me...

893
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:55.302
...a cheeky fellow.

894
01:31:56.095 --> 01:31:58.472
This is not the conduct of a gentleman.

895
01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:01.767
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

896
01:32:01.934 --> 01:32:04.228
...I'll take that as a compliment.

897
01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:07.147
Get my men.

898
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:13.987
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

899
01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:15.739
Thank you, sir.

900
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:28.794
General quarters!

901
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.004
Open the gates.

902
01:32:46.812 --> 01:32:48.981
Release the prisoners!

903
01:32:53.444 --> 01:32:55.654
- General, what is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

904
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:57.364
He has 18 of our officers.

905
01:32:57.531 --> 01:32:59.575
Who is he? I recognize him.

906
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:01.577
He's the commander of the militia.

907
01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:06.081
Your ghost. Stay that sword, colonel!

908
01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:08.417
He rode in under a white flag
for formal parley.

909
01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.627
This is madness.

910
01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:13.005
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

911
01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:18.886
With respect, sir, he's killed
as many officers in the last two months.

912
01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:23.515
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

913
01:33:23.682 --> 01:33:25.726
Has he not?

914
01:33:28.896 --> 01:33:29.938
You!

915
01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.734
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

916
01:33:33.901 --> 01:33:37.321
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

917
01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:44.495
Did he die?

918
01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:49.541
You know...

919
01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:52.711
...it's an ugly business, doing one's duty.

920
01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:55.380
But just occasionally...

921
01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:57.674
...it's a real pleasure.

922
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:04.640
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

923
01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:09.561
Why wait?

924
01:34:18.737 --> 01:34:20.364
Soon.

925
01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:54.398
Move out!

926
01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:02.030
But I still think
it's imperative to push north...

927
01:35:05.409 --> 01:35:07.703
One of our captured officers, my lord.

928
01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:15.961
<i>My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!</i>

929
01:35:16.128 --> 01:35:19.381
That man insults me!

930
01:35:19.882 --> 01:35:23.635
Quite impressive for a farmer
with a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

931
01:35:30.809 --> 01:35:33.812
I want you to find that man.

932
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:36.607
I want you to capture him.

933
01:35:37.691 --> 01:35:40.277
The man has the loyalty of the people.

934
01:35:40.444 --> 01:35:42.821
They protect him. Protect his family.

935
01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:44.615
Protect the families of his men.

936
01:35:45.991 --> 01:35:48.452
I can capture him for you.

937
01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:53.749
But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...

938
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.377
What was the word Your Lordship used?

939
01:35:58.837 --> 01:36:00.380
"Brutal," I think.

940
01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.140
Go on.

941
01:36:19.274 --> 01:36:22.069
I am prepared to do what is necessary.

942
01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:26.698
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

943
01:36:26.865 --> 01:36:29.034
...free of the chain of command...

944
01:36:29.201 --> 01:36:31.745
...rendering you blameless.

945
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.497
However...

946
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.457
...if I do this...

947
01:36:35.624 --> 01:36:39.586
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honor.

948
01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:46.677
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

949
01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.979
When this war is over
here in the Colonies...

950
01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:59.398
...the new aristocracy...

951
01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.485
...will be landowners.

952
01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:13.286
Tell me about Ohio.

953
01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.085
Make way.

954
01:37:21.128 --> 01:37:22.754
As you were.

955
01:37:25.632 --> 01:37:29.761
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

956
01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:32.389
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

957
01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:36.810
- Benjamin Martin.
- He's the ghost.

958
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.771
What do you know about him?

959
01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:43.692
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

960
01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:48.321
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

961
01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:59.750
His wife's sister has a plantation.

962
01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:02.127
It's not far.

963
01:38:35.619 --> 01:38:39.331
Aunt Charlotte. Aunt Charlotte.
Wake up, someone's coming.

964
01:38:44.336 --> 01:38:46.213
Get the boys.

965
01:38:48.381 --> 01:38:51.093
Margaret, come quickly.

966
01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:54.429
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

967
01:38:54.596 --> 01:38:55.639
Go.

968
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:02.062
Stay close.

969
01:39:07.818 --> 01:39:09.528
This way.

970
01:39:25.752 --> 01:39:27.295
Follow me.

971
01:39:30.257 --> 01:39:33.218
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

972
01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:41.601
Margaret, quick. Get down there. Fast.

973
01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:55.282
Samuel, get down there fast.

974
01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:58.451
Nothing, sir!

975
01:40:52.631 --> 01:40:55.008
Beneath the sill. There.

976
01:40:57.177 --> 01:40:58.845
There's no one in the house.

977
01:40:59.012 --> 01:41:01.014
They can't be far.

978
01:41:01.181 --> 01:41:04.226
- Search the outbuildings and the woods.
- Yes, sir.

979
01:41:40.971 --> 01:41:43.181
Prepare to fire the house.

980
01:41:43.515 --> 01:41:45.058
Go.

981
01:42:04.661 --> 01:42:07.289
This one's head of the house slaves, sir.

982
01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:13.753
Where are they hiding?

983
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:19.634
Keep looking! They're here somewhere!

984
01:42:25.557 --> 01:42:27.309
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?

985
01:42:27.475 --> 01:42:29.185
Torch the house!

986
01:42:46.786 --> 01:42:47.829
To horse!

987
01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:56.921
Come on. It's all right.

988
01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.090
Susan, come here.

989
01:43:08.266 --> 01:43:09.934
Charlotte.

990
01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:28.161
They won't stop looking for us.

991
01:43:30.413 --> 01:43:32.916
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

992
01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:36.461
Father said it was a perfect place to hide.

993
01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:40.298
How is he?

994
01:43:45.387 --> 01:43:47.222
I don't know. I'm his son.

995
01:43:47.389 --> 01:43:49.641
Where is Father?

996
01:43:50.809 --> 01:43:52.435
Speaking for months now.

997
01:43:52.602 --> 01:43:54.229
Speaking for months.

998
01:43:54.396 --> 01:43:56.564
Why did he go?

999
01:43:58.441 --> 01:44:02.320
Well, he didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

1000
01:44:02.487 --> 01:44:05.031
He'll come and see you
as soon as he can.

1001
01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:08.118
I don't care. I hate him.

1002
01:44:09.536 --> 01:44:11.287
Susan, you don't hate him.

1003
01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:14.999
I hate him,
and I hope he never comes back.

1004
01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:50.702
It's the children.

1005
01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:52.704
Abigale!

1006
01:44:54.581 --> 01:44:56.458
You're alive!

1007
01:45:05.216 --> 01:45:09.137
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

1008
01:45:09.304 --> 01:45:11.014
In full sentences.

1009
01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:14.184
As if she'd been speaking all along.

1010
01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:18.480
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

1011
01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:20.482
What did she say?

1012
01:45:23.067 --> 01:45:24.986
She said...

1013
01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:29.616
...that she loves you and misses you...

1014
01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:32.202
...but understands
why you can't be there with her.

1015
01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.707
My Lord, she said that.

1016
01:45:38.041 --> 01:45:39.459
Well, isn't that something?

1017
01:45:43.588 --> 01:45:46.508
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

1018
01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:48.551
...killing whomever resists.

1019
01:45:49.177 --> 01:45:50.303
Where?

1020
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:52.680
Seven homes along the Santee so far.

1021
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:42.272
John.

1022
01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.616
John. John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

1023
01:46:54.534 --> 01:46:57.328
This is a time for mourning.

1024
01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:03.459
John.

1025
01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.469
No!

1026
01:47:31.529 --> 01:47:33.656
Attend to your families.

1027
01:47:35.658 --> 01:47:38.244
One week furlough for all men.

1028
01:47:38.786 --> 01:47:43.333
Any man who does not return will not be
thought a coward or uncommitted.

1029
01:47:59.182 --> 01:48:00.475
Father!

1030
01:48:00.642 --> 01:48:02.018
Father!

1031
01:48:02.185 --> 01:48:03.686
- Papa!
- Father!

1032
01:48:03.853 --> 01:48:06.189
- Meg!
- Father!

1033
01:48:08.524 --> 01:48:09.567
Gabriel!

1034
01:48:09.734 --> 01:48:11.986
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

1035
01:48:12.153 --> 01:48:14.697
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

1036
01:48:14.864 --> 01:48:16.366
Thank you.

1037
01:48:23.873 --> 01:48:25.541
Susan?

1038
01:49:05.206 --> 01:49:09.085
I see it. There it is. Look. Look, Father.

1039
01:49:10.795 --> 01:49:12.880
I got it! I got it!

1040
01:49:13.047 --> 01:49:14.090
You got it.

1041
01:49:14.924 --> 01:49:16.300
I got it!

1042
01:49:16.467 --> 01:49:17.677
- Careful.
- I caught it.

1043
01:49:17.844 --> 01:49:20.388
- Samuel, all the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

1044
01:49:27.311 --> 01:49:29.522
Father, what changed you?

1045
01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:33.735
Are you sure I have?

1046
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:37.113
Yes. You changed.

1047
01:49:44.162 --> 01:49:47.290
That's simple. It was your mother.

1048
01:49:52.837 --> 01:49:55.381
A woman can have
a strange effect on a man.

1049
01:49:55.548 --> 01:49:56.716
Yep.

1050
01:49:56.883 --> 01:49:59.010
There were times...

1051
01:49:59.177 --> 01:50:01.846
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

1052
01:50:02.764 --> 01:50:04.724
I know the feeling.

1053
01:50:06.434 --> 01:50:08.436
You once said...

1054
01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.483
...when I had a family of my own,
that I'd understand.

1055
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:19.489
You were right.

1056
01:50:21.699 --> 01:50:23.785
You're trying to tell me something.

1057
01:50:40.426 --> 01:50:42.136
- Apple?
- Thank you.

1058
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:50.061
Congratulations.

1059
01:50:50.228 --> 01:50:51.938
<i>Anne Patricia Howard...</i>

1060
01:50:52.104 --> 01:50:54.273
...will you have this man
to be your husband...

1061
01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.400
...to live in the covenant of marriage?

1062
01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:59.278
Will you love, comfort and honor him...

1063
01:50:59.445 --> 01:51:01.572
...for so long as you both shall live?

1064
01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.825
I will.

1065
01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:07.286
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

1066
01:51:07.453 --> 01:51:10.373
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

1067
01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:14.377
Will you love, comfort and honor her
for so long as you both shall live?

1068
01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:15.962
I will.

1069
01:51:16.128 --> 01:51:19.006
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutual faith...

1070
01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.217
...in the Lord, our God...

1071
01:51:21.384 --> 01:51:24.887
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1072
01:51:51.789 --> 01:51:54.041
I'm sorry
we didn't give you more warning.

1073
01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:55.251
It's fine.

1074
01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:57.795
I have something for you.

1075
01:52:00.089 --> 01:52:01.799
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

1076
01:52:01.966 --> 01:52:04.302
It's beautiful.

1077
01:52:04.802 --> 01:52:06.512
Allow me.

1078
01:52:07.305 --> 01:52:09.181
It's the North Star.

1079
01:52:09.348 --> 01:52:13.227
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

1080
01:52:13.394 --> 01:52:16.689
It's constant, unwavering.

1081
01:52:16.856 --> 01:52:18.441
A guide.

1082
01:52:21.736 --> 01:52:23.821
I'd be honored.

1083
01:52:28.534 --> 01:52:29.660
May I?

1084
01:52:29.827 --> 01:52:32.204
- If you must.
- I must.

1085
01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:49.597
May I sit with you?

1086
01:52:49.764 --> 01:52:52.183
It's a free country.

1087
01:52:52.642 --> 01:52:53.935
Or at least, it will be.

1088
01:53:06.322 --> 01:53:08.282
I'm not my sister.

1089
01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:11.410
I know that.

1090
01:53:11.786 --> 01:53:13.579
Do you?

1091
01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:16.332
Yes, I do.

1092
01:53:17.083 --> 01:53:18.960
Very well, then.

1093
01:53:23.214 --> 01:53:24.256
Well?

1094
01:53:25.967 --> 01:53:27.593
Well what?

1095
01:53:48.864 --> 01:53:51.367
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1096
01:53:51.534 --> 01:53:53.744
Not soon enough.

1097
01:53:53.911 --> 01:53:55.913
Nathan, I'm counting on you
to make sure...

1098
01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.623
- I know.
- What?

1099
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:59.667
Say my prayers, take care of everyone.

1100
01:53:59.834 --> 01:54:01.794
Couldn't have said it better.

1101
01:54:06.132 --> 01:54:07.174
Goodbye.

1102
01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.468
Goodbye.

1103
01:54:29.238 --> 01:54:30.489
Goodbye, Susan.

1104
01:54:33.075 --> 01:54:34.493
Goodbye?

1105
01:54:37.329 --> 01:54:39.040
Just one word, that's all I want.

1106
01:54:41.542 --> 01:54:43.002
No?

1107
01:54:48.257 --> 01:54:49.800
All right.

1108
01:55:17.078 --> 01:55:18.454
Papa!

1109
01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:23.459
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1110
01:55:28.214 --> 01:55:29.673
Please, Papa.

1111
01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:34.136
I'll say anything you want.

1112
01:55:34.303 --> 01:55:39.475
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything you want me to say.

1113
01:55:40.184 --> 01:55:43.104
- I promise, Papa. Please don't go.
- Susan. Susan.

1114
01:55:44.230 --> 01:55:45.898
I promise.

1115
01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.234
I'll come back.

1116
01:55:48.734 --> 01:55:50.778
I'll come back. You believe me?

1117
01:55:54.156 --> 01:55:56.534
You know, you make me very happy.

1118
01:56:32.153 --> 01:56:33.946
Just the three of us?

1119
01:56:34.405 --> 01:56:37.116
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1120
01:56:37.741 --> 01:56:40.119
He looked around, then he left.

1121
01:56:40.703 --> 01:56:42.037
He would've made four.

1122
01:56:42.538 --> 01:56:44.540
Four would have been better.

1123
01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:22.953
I got another two months to go
before I get to 12 months.

1124
01:57:28.292 --> 01:57:29.335
Colonel.

1125
01:57:30.544 --> 01:57:32.046
Reverend.

1126
01:57:35.132 --> 01:57:36.800
Trust the French.

1127
01:57:37.509 --> 01:57:38.719
Yes, trust the French.

1128
01:57:38.886 --> 01:57:42.973
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few redcoats?

1129
01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:46.602
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

1130
01:58:12.962 --> 01:58:15.214
Everyone must gather at the church.

1131
01:58:15.381 --> 01:58:16.674
Mr. Wilkins?

1132
01:58:18.175 --> 01:58:21.595
Colonel Tavington wishes
to address the whole village.

1133
01:58:38.988 --> 01:58:43.450
This town has given aid
to Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1134
01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:45.452
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1135
01:58:46.912 --> 01:58:48.372
So...

1136
01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:50.624
...anyone who comes forward...

1137
01:58:50.791 --> 01:58:52.960
...may be forgiven their treason.

1138
01:58:58.716 --> 01:58:59.758
Very well.

1139
01:58:59.925 --> 01:59:02.386
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

1140
01:59:03.554 --> 01:59:05.764
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

1141
01:59:05.931 --> 01:59:07.975
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

1142
01:59:08.142 --> 01:59:10.227
In the marsh, by the old Spanish mission.

1143
01:59:11.186 --> 01:59:12.354
This man here?

1144
01:59:12.813 --> 01:59:14.732
- Yes, sir.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

1145
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:17.568
By the old Spanish mission.

1146
01:59:19.236 --> 01:59:20.612
Thank you very much.

1147
01:59:26.827 --> 01:59:28.704
Shut the doors.

1148
01:59:29.997 --> 01:59:32.583
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1149
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:33.917
And indeed you may!

1150
01:59:36.754 --> 01:59:38.380
But that's between you and God.

1151
01:59:45.596 --> 01:59:46.972
Be strong.

1152
01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:52.478
- Ready to fire the town on your orders.
- The town?

1153
01:59:52.936 --> 01:59:54.438
Burn the church.

1154
01:59:57.024 --> 01:59:58.734
There's no honor in this.

1155
02:00:01.111 --> 02:00:03.947
Didn't you say all those
who stand against England...

1156
02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:06.617
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1157
02:00:09.286 --> 02:00:12.539
Burn the church, captain.

1158
02:00:24.093 --> 02:00:26.637
- Give me the torch.
- Sir.

1159
02:00:57.918 --> 02:00:59.545
Help!

1160
02:01:01.171 --> 02:01:02.923
Remain calm.

1161
02:01:08.262 --> 02:01:11.140
The honor is found in the end,
not the means.

1162
02:01:12.057 --> 02:01:14.101
This will be forgotten.

1163
02:01:14.518 --> 02:01:16.019
Bordon.

1164
02:02:55.327 --> 02:02:57.037
Anne!

1165
02:03:00.791 --> 02:03:02.876
Mrs. Howard?

1166
02:03:06.630 --> 02:03:08.715
Where is everybody?

1167
02:03:13.345 --> 02:03:15.514
They're not... They're not here.

1168
02:04:23.665 --> 02:04:25.709
Gabriel's gone.

1169
02:05:10.712 --> 02:05:13.173
To arms! To arms!

1170
02:09:32.515 --> 02:09:33.767
Father.

1171
02:09:33.934 --> 02:09:35.060
- Father.
- Quiet.

1172
02:09:35.226 --> 02:09:37.520
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1173
02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:44.945
Father.

1174
02:09:45.487 --> 02:09:47.739
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

1175
02:09:47.906 --> 02:09:51.493
- I'll take care of you. You'll be all right.
- Father.

1176
02:09:53.203 --> 02:09:57.040
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1177
02:10:02.837 --> 02:10:05.340
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1178
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:10.261
That was mine.

1179
02:10:14.599 --> 02:10:18.144
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1180
02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.650
Don't go. Gabriel, don't...

1181
02:10:52.429 --> 02:10:55.056
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1182
02:11:28.798 --> 02:11:30.550
Where is he?

1183
02:11:38.058 --> 02:11:40.268
I'll help you bury him.

1184
02:11:42.145 --> 02:11:43.438
I'll bury him.

1185
02:11:46.733 --> 02:11:49.986
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1186
02:11:50.987 --> 02:11:52.906
My first.

1187
02:11:53.323 --> 02:11:55.116
I fight for that child.

1188
02:11:57.827 --> 02:12:00.246
Benjamin, nothing will replace your sons.

1189
02:12:01.664 --> 02:12:06.252
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

1190
02:12:07.670 --> 02:12:09.547
Why?

1191
02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.220
Why do men feel they can justify death?

1192
02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:23.394
Is it arrogance or...?

1193
02:12:28.024 --> 02:12:30.485
I have long feared...

1194
02:12:31.736 --> 02:12:35.657
...that my sins would return to visit me.

1195
02:12:38.243 --> 02:12:41.287
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1196
02:12:42.205 --> 02:12:46.042
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1197
02:12:46.584 --> 02:12:50.255
Greene and Dan Morgan
are down from Virginia.

1198
02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:56.010
If we win this next battle,
victory in the war is within our grasp.

1199
02:12:56.177 --> 02:12:57.220
Go, then.

1200
02:12:57.387 --> 02:12:59.722
Seek your victory.

1201
02:13:02.725 --> 02:13:05.728
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

1202
02:13:06.563 --> 02:13:08.815
You matter to your men...

1203
02:13:10.066 --> 02:13:12.235
...and to others as well.

1204
02:13:12.402 --> 02:13:14.237
Your victories...

1205
02:13:14.404 --> 02:13:16.573
...and your losses...

1206
02:13:17.574 --> 02:13:20.326
...are shared by more than you know.

1207
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:23.037
Stay with us.

1208
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:25.415
Stay the course.

1209
02:13:35.258 --> 02:13:37.552
I have run my course.

1210
02:13:57.447 --> 02:14:00.366
You men will be leaving with us.

1211
02:14:01.576 --> 02:14:04.954
Yes. Prepare the baggage.

1212
02:15:08.851 --> 02:15:10.353
Jean.

1213
02:16:02.989 --> 02:16:06.284
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

1214
02:16:06.451 --> 02:16:09.412
General Greene,
what exactly is the task before us?

1215
02:16:09.579 --> 02:16:12.957
Gentlemen, Cornwallis has us cornered.

1216
02:16:13.333 --> 02:16:18.755
Not only does he outnumber us,
but nearly half of our force is militia.

1217
02:16:19.630 --> 02:16:21.924
Unreliable, at best.

1218
02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.052
Excuse me, sir.

1219
02:16:25.803 --> 02:16:28.431
I believe you underestimate our militia.

1220
02:16:29.807 --> 02:16:31.517
All of you do.

1221
02:16:31.976 --> 02:16:34.771
We've seen
our militia lines break time and again.

1222
02:16:34.937 --> 02:16:36.397
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1223
02:16:36.814 --> 02:16:39.359
But the British have seen that too.

1224
02:16:39.859 --> 02:16:43.571
Cornwallis's own letters bear out
that he has no respect for the militia.

1225
02:16:44.364 --> 02:16:46.657
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1226
02:16:48.117 --> 02:16:50.578
I'm suggesting we use that.

1227
02:16:57.168 --> 02:17:01.214
So I know you men
have sacrificed a lot so far.

1228
02:17:01.381 --> 02:17:04.842
But all I'm asking is that you...

1229
02:17:05.009 --> 02:17:08.262
...let the front line of militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

1230
02:17:10.223 --> 02:17:13.643
A lot can happen in the time
it takes to fire two shots.

1231
02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:16.562
Especially against British Regulars.

1232
02:17:17.188 --> 02:17:18.231
Indeed.

1233
02:17:18.398 --> 02:17:21.359
That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

1234
02:18:18.249 --> 02:18:20.793
If I die, I will die well-dressed.

1235
02:19:06.672 --> 02:19:07.882
Fire!

1236
02:19:08.049 --> 02:19:09.258
Fire!

1237
02:19:11.677 --> 02:19:15.431
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

1238
02:19:31.614 --> 02:19:32.865
Harry...

1239
02:19:33.699 --> 02:19:36.160
...will you give this to my children?

1240
02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:47.797
Thank you.

1241
02:19:56.556 --> 02:19:58.641
It's October now.

1242
02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:02.228
I know.

1243
02:20:02.937 --> 02:20:05.273
It's more than 12 months.

1244
02:20:05.439 --> 02:20:06.649
You're a free man.

1245
02:20:07.817 --> 02:20:11.028
I'm here now on my own accord.

1246
02:20:14.448 --> 02:20:17.034
I'm honored to have you with us.

1247
02:20:18.869 --> 02:20:20.538
Honored.

1248
02:20:21.706 --> 02:20:24.959
Shoulder arms!

1249
02:20:30.131 --> 02:20:32.216
- Forward...
- Company!

1250
02:20:32.383 --> 02:20:33.759
...march!

1251
02:20:38.681 --> 02:20:40.891
How old were your daughters?

1252
02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:45.605
Violette was 12 and Pauline 10.

1253
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:48.482
They had green eyes.

1254
02:20:49.483 --> 02:20:51.652
I'm sure they were lovely.

1255
02:20:52.862 --> 02:20:55.531
Yes, they were.

1256
02:21:06.375 --> 02:21:09.754
- Battalion! March!
- Company!

1257
02:21:11.422 --> 02:21:13.007
Fire!

1258
02:21:15.426 --> 02:21:16.677
Unless I'm dreaming...

1259
02:21:17.386 --> 02:21:21.807
...I believe I see militia forming
at their center.

1260
02:21:35.738 --> 02:21:38.991
Battalion, halt!

1261
02:21:56.258 --> 02:21:59.095
Dress ranks!

1262
02:22:06.769 --> 02:22:08.396
Make ready!

1263
02:22:20.116 --> 02:22:21.992
Battalion!

1264
02:22:22.159 --> 02:22:23.202
Halt!

1265
02:22:26.288 --> 02:22:27.498
Take aim!

1266
02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:32.002
- Fire!
- Fire!

1267
02:22:38.342 --> 02:22:40.219
Take aim!

1268
02:22:43.097 --> 02:22:44.181
Fire!

1269
02:22:56.610 --> 02:22:57.653
Fire!

1270
02:23:05.119 --> 02:23:06.662
Hold the line!

1271
02:23:06.829 --> 02:23:08.289
Hold the line!

1272
02:23:12.418 --> 02:23:15.921
- Prepare to charge!
- Sir, we haven't been given that order.

1273
02:23:16.088 --> 02:23:18.132
Charge!

1274
02:23:18.507 --> 02:23:19.592
Charge!

1275
02:23:23.095 --> 02:23:24.555
Tavington.

1276
02:23:24.722 --> 02:23:26.891
Damn him! Damn that man!

1277
02:23:28.809 --> 02:23:30.644
Make ready!

1278
02:23:30.811 --> 02:23:32.772
Take aim!

1279
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:34.273
Fire!

1280
02:23:35.566 --> 02:23:37.443
Take aim!

1281
02:23:37.818 --> 02:23:38.903
Fire!

1282
02:23:39.069 --> 02:23:40.196
Retreat!

1283
02:23:46.202 --> 02:23:50.206
Bayonet charge. We'll see
who takes the glory from this field.

1284
02:23:50.581 --> 02:23:52.166
Charge!

1285
02:24:12.102 --> 02:24:13.437
Congratulations, my lord.

1286
02:24:13.896 --> 02:24:16.899
- Infantry reserve into the center.
- But you've taken the field.

1287
02:24:17.066 --> 02:24:18.484
Now we'll take their spirits.

1288
02:24:18.651 --> 02:24:21.737
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

1289
02:24:21.904 --> 02:24:23.322
It ends today.

1290
02:24:46.595 --> 02:24:47.763
Hold the charge!

1291
02:24:48.764 --> 02:24:49.890
Fire!

1292
02:24:50.057 --> 02:24:52.351
Hold the charge!

1293
02:24:56.105 --> 02:24:57.523
Fire!

1294
02:24:57.690 --> 02:24:59.275
Fire!

1295
02:25:02.987 --> 02:25:04.113
Take aim!

1296
02:25:05.823 --> 02:25:07.449
Fire!

1297
02:25:15.583 --> 02:25:17.209
Charge!

1298
02:25:24.008 --> 02:25:25.634
Charge bayonets!

1299
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:56.165
Halt!

1300
02:25:57.166 --> 02:25:58.709
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1301
02:26:01.253 --> 02:26:02.838
Fire!

1302
02:26:05.966 --> 02:26:07.843
Charge!

1303
02:26:31.158 --> 02:26:33.494
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

1304
02:26:37.915 --> 02:26:39.124
Colonel!

1305
02:26:40.834 --> 02:26:42.461
The line is faltering!

1306
02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:46.507
Retreat! Retreat!

1307
02:26:54.348 --> 02:26:56.100
Wait!

1308
02:26:56.558 --> 02:26:58.644
No retreat!

1309
02:27:02.106 --> 02:27:05.109
Hold the line!

1310
02:27:05.943 --> 02:27:08.028
Hold the line!

1311
02:27:10.155 --> 02:27:13.617
Hold! Hold!

1312
02:27:13.784 --> 02:27:16.996
Hold, hold!

1313
02:27:19.707 --> 02:27:22.793
Push forward, men!

1314
02:27:52.364 --> 02:27:53.866
Yeah!

1315
02:27:58.454 --> 02:28:00.622
Charge!

1316
02:28:12.301 --> 02:28:14.553
Artillery, concentrate on the center.

1317
02:28:29.818 --> 02:28:33.614
My lord, if we reform and wheel right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

1318
02:28:33.781 --> 02:28:35.908
You dream, general.

1319
02:31:38.215 --> 02:31:41.134
Kill me before the war is over, will you?

1320
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:45.138
It appears you are not...

1321
02:31:45.305 --> 02:31:47.599
...the better man.

1322
02:32:01.196 --> 02:32:02.239
You're right.

1323
02:32:07.035 --> 02:32:09.663
My sons were better men.

1324
02:32:36.857 --> 02:32:38.775
Sound the retreat.

1325
02:32:41.903 --> 02:32:43.613
Sound...

1326
02:32:44.489 --> 02:32:45.699
...retreat.

1327
02:33:03.717 --> 02:33:04.760
<i>Dear Charlotte:</i>

1328
02:33:05.469 --> 02:33:07.304
<i>The war has turned.</i>

1329
02:33:07.471 --> 02:33:11.141
<i>General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.</i>

1330
02:33:11.308 --> 02:33:14.436
<i>We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...</i>

1331
02:33:14.603 --> 02:33:18.106
<i>...Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.</i>

1332
02:33:19.483 --> 02:33:21.610
<i>Washington escaped from the north...</i>

1333
02:33:21.777 --> 02:33:25.238
<i>...and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.</i>

1334
02:33:25.405 --> 02:33:28.658
<i>It was blocked off
by our long-lost friends...</i>

1335
02:33:28.825 --> 02:33:31.703
<i>...who had finally arrived.</i>

1336
02:33:35.832 --> 02:33:37.250
<i>Vive la France.</i>

1337
02:33:39.961 --> 02:33:41.546
<i>Vive la liberté.</i>

1338
02:33:53.683 --> 02:33:55.936
My lord, I beseech you.

1339
02:33:56.269 --> 02:33:58.480
You must order the surrender.

1340
02:33:59.356 --> 02:34:02.484
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

1341
02:34:03.151 --> 02:34:04.903
Peasants.

1342
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:09.032
Everything will change.

1343
02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:14.621
Everything has changed.

1344
02:34:14.996 --> 02:34:17.124
<i>Though he eventually surrendered...</i>

1345
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:19.793
<i>...Cornwallis himself hid in shame...</i>

1346
02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.964
<i>...appointing his subordinate
to relinquish his sword.</i>

1347
02:34:24.756 --> 02:34:27.926
<i>With the war ending
and our militia disbanding...</i>

1348
02:34:28.093 --> 02:34:30.762
<i>...I take measure of what we have lost...</i>

1349
02:34:30.929 --> 02:34:32.806
<i>...and what we have won.</i>

1350
02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:38.437
<i>My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...</i>

1351
02:34:38.603 --> 02:34:42.691
<i>...will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation.</i>

1352
02:34:43.650 --> 02:34:47.863
<i>Tell the children, and especially Susan,
that I will keep my promise...</i>

1353
02:34:48.029 --> 02:34:51.575
<i>...as I will be returning to you all soon.</i>

1354
02:34:57.747 --> 02:34:59.416
Where will you go now?

1355
02:35:00.208 --> 02:35:02.502
Home. Start over.

1356
02:35:02.669 --> 02:35:05.088
Your wife's expecting a child, isn't she?

1357
02:35:05.255 --> 02:35:08.091
She gave birth to a son three weeks ago.

1358
02:35:09.134 --> 02:35:10.719
What'd you name him?

1359
02:35:12.637 --> 02:35:14.639
We named him Gabriel.

1360
02:35:20.145 --> 02:35:21.188
Thank you, Harry.

1361
02:35:28.403 --> 02:35:31.114
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.

1362
02:35:31.615 --> 02:35:34.409
It is. It is.

1363
02:35:34.576 --> 02:35:37.204
- Jean.
- Ben.

1364
02:36:44.396 --> 02:36:47.315
Gabriel said if we won the war...

1365
02:36:47.482 --> 02:36:49.484
...we could build a whole new world.

1366
02:36:50.443 --> 02:36:53.446
Just figured we'd get started right here...

1367
02:36:54.614 --> 02:36:56.533
...with your home.

1368
02:37:00.328 --> 02:37:02.205
Sounds good.

1369
02:37:05.208 --> 02:37:06.251
Thank you.

1370
02:37:11.006 --> 02:37:12.090
Ma'am.
