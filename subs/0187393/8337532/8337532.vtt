Yes, Father.

I want you to reload for Nathan.

I want you two to drop your weapons

383

and I want you to run
as quickly as you can.

384
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:16.621

get your brother and your sisters

He said there was--
Were you there?

434
00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:50.760
Then let him speak.

435
00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:54.764
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

436
00:48:54.973 --> 00:48:56.891
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

437
00:48:57.392 --> 00:48:59.727
I don't really remember how many.

438
00:49:02.147 --> 00:49:03.272
Maybe one.

439
00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:07.985
One man. Really?

440
00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:09.987
He was in the flank.

00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:14.992

He was there, and then he was gone.

444
00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:20.039
He just vanished.

445
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.833

446

Yes. A ghost.

447
00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:28.673
He was like a ghost.

448
00:49:30.258 --> 00:49:31.592

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.430
Bordon? Take a patrol.

450
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.600
See if we can't capture this ghost
before word of his exploits spread.

451
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.728
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

452
00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:44.689
He was with the Loyalist Colonial Militia.

453
00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:46.440
I thought he might be of use.

454
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.776
Another colonial.

455
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:51.737
Tell me, Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

456
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.072
To king and country, sir.

457
00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.908
Why should I trust a man
who'd betray his neighbors?

458
00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:59.745
Those neighbors of mine
who stand against England

459
00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:01.706
deserve to die a traitor's death.

460
00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.874
We'll see.

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.674

474

you should be ashamed.

I've done nothing.

476
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:52.274
And for that, I am ashamed.

477

We'll go to Saint Helena.

That's a free slave island
just north of Charles Town.

479

00:59:20.848 --> 00:59:22.349
Always too eager for glory.

539
00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:26.436
For victory, my lord.

540
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:28.897
I believe we took the field.

541
00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:31.692
Next time, you'll wait for my command.

542
00:59:32.277 --> 00:59:36.738
It appears that Colonel Tavington
prefers to follow his own commands.

543
00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.240
General O'Hara tells me

544
00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:42.286
you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.

545
00:59:42.453 --> 00:59:44.454
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

Where's your General Gates now?

556
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.779
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast,

557
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.948
his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

558
01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.534
So who's in command?

559
01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:06.495
I am.

560
01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:08.830
I think.

561
01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.375
What are my orders?

562
01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:19.508
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

563
01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:25.347
In the north, Washington
is reeling from Morristown.

564
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:28.225
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

565
01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.019
In the south, Cornwallis
has broken our back.

566
01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:34.481
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

567
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:37.859
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

568
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:43.031
So now there's nothing to stop him
from heading north to finish off Washington.

569
01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:47.160
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

570
01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:51.123
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

571
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.999
When?

572
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.461
Uh, six months at the earliest.

573
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.047
You actually trust the French
to keep their word?

VILLENEUVE: <i>Absolument.</i>

575
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:05.595
BURWELL: Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

576
01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:08.515
French Seventh Light Foot.
He's here to help train the militia.

577
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.728
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

578
01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:20.736
You really expect to hold Cornwallis here
using just militia?

579
01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.238
Not me. You.

580
01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.451
Harry, they're not soldiers,
they're farmers.

581
01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:29.828
They'd be better off letting
the British just march through.

582
01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:33.165
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

583
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.293
How many men does Cornwallis have
under his command?

584
01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.754
Eight thousand infantry.

585
01:02:38.963 --> 01:02:41.381
Around 600 cavalry.

586
01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.176
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

587
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.429
Might I request, sir, that you transfer
my son here under my command?

588

- Sir, no, I--
- No.

Thank you.

591
01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.107
Colonel, I've been a soldier now
for two years.

592
01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.777
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

593
01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:03.028
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

594
01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.529
I'd be of better use with Regulars.

595
01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.865
Where'd you learn all that riding,
shooting, scavenging?

596
01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.742
My father taught me.

597
01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.329
Teach you any humility?

598
01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:14.748
He tried. It didn't take.

599
01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:19.711
He also taught you every deer path and
swamp trail between here and Charles Town,

600
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.671
which is why he asked
for your transfer.

601
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.966
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of--

602
01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.427
We can cover more ground
if we split up.

603
01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:34.559
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

604
01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:38.104
I'll start on the north side.
We'll meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

605
01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.940
Yes, sir.

606
01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.069

607
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.280

Though, of course, your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those

who fight for him as gentlemen.

621
01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.985
I dare to presume my own meagre contributions
will be rewarded one day.

You may presume too much.

His Majesty, like history, judges us
not only by the outcome of the war

624

but the manner in which
it was fought.

- My lord?
- We serve the Crown,

626
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.873
and we must conduct ourselves accordingly.

627
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:22.792

You serve me,

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:34.346
and the manner in which you serve me
reflects upon me!

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.975
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours

633
01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.685
would understand that.

634
01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:45.482

Tell me what happened.

Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

933
01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.768
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

934
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.903
The French and the Cherokee
had raided along the Blue Ridge.

935
01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:18.698
The English settlers
had sought refuge at Fort Charles.

936
01:32:19.158 --> 01:32:22.369
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

937
01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:25.789
They'd left about a week before.

938
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.834

939
01:32:32.588 --> 01:32:33.838
Go on.

940
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:40.470

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:46.726
some of the children, they had...

943
01:32:49.814 --> 01:32:52.774
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

944
01:32:55.444 --> 01:32:58.154
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

We took our time.

946
01:33:05.162 --> 01:33:08.164
We cut them apart slowly.

947
01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:10.542
Piece by piece.

948
01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:17.882
I can see their faces.

949
01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:23.388
I can still hear their screams.

950
01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:28.810
All but two. We let them live.

951
01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:32.314
We placed the heads on a pallet

952
01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:35.150
and sent them back with the two
that lived to Fort Ambercon.

953
01:33:35.901 --> 01:33:39.195
The eyes, tongues, fingers,

954
01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:41.364
we put in baskets.

955
01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:44.701
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

956
01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:50.165
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

957
01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:55.003
That's how we justified it.

958

Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

But not at the expense of our cause.

There will be a time for revenge.

966

But until then, stay the course.

967
01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:54.854
That's what your mother used to say to me
when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

968
01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:57.565
She'd say it to me

Colonel, you must know
that in civilized warfare,

1012
01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:40.455
officers in the field must not be accorded
inappropriate levels of hostile attention.

levels of hostile attention?

1016
01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:54.636
There must be gentlemen

and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

1018

Restrain them from, say, targeting civilians.
Women, children and such.

That's a separate issue.
