1
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:54.230
Bingo!

2
00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:11.314
Fucking hell.

3
00:02:13.574 --> 00:02:15.535
Fucking hell.

4
00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.369
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

5
00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.500
If you wanna get
'em out of here.

6
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.020
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

7
00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:31.725
Security, we have a break-in.
Get the...

8
00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.028
I know who you are. I
know what you think...

9
00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:44.495
If you don't wanna get hurt,

10
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.073
keep your mouth shut and
don't move a fucking muscle.

11
00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.750
The chimps are infected!

12
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.314
They're-They're highly contagious.
They've been given an inhibitor.

13
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.367
Infected with what?

14
00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:55.885
In order to cure, you
must first understand.

15
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.902
Infected with what?

16
00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:02.733
Rage.

17
00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:07.604
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

18
00:04:07.694 --> 00:04:09.035
No! No! No!

19
00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:14.036
Listen, you sick bastard, we're going and
we're taking your torture victims with us.

20
00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:15.696
We're gonna get you out of here.

21
00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:20.478
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

22
00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:23.038
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

23
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.441
Get it off! Help me!

24
00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:39.963
Get it off! Get it off!

25
00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:46.784
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

26
00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:51.096
Oh, my God!

27
00:04:55.447 --> 00:04:58.658
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

28
00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:02.749
Oh, God...

29
00:06:51.737 --> 00:06:53.257
Hello?

30
00:07:31.697 --> 00:07:33.178
Hello?

31
00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:53.353
Hello!

32
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.600
Hello?

33
00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.437
Hello!

34
00:14:56.774 --> 00:14:58.864
Hello?

35
00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:08.947
Hello?

36
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.391
Father?

37
00:15:31.823 --> 00:15:33.873
Father, are you okay?

38
00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.916
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

39
00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:46.567
Shouldn't have done that.

40
00:15:47.007 --> 00:15:48.877
Shit!

41
00:16:15.664 --> 00:16:17.755
Over here!

42
00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:22.966
- Over here!
- Come on!

43
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:37.930
Go, go, go!

44
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:44.232
Keep going!

45
00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:47.192
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

46
00:16:55.365 --> 00:16:57.935
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

47
00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:26.703
Let's go! Let's move!

48
00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:29.013
- Please, tell me what the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

49
00:17:37.646 --> 00:17:39.646
Come on!

50
00:17:58.821 --> 00:18:03.562
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

51
00:18:03.652 --> 00:18:05.653
The giraffe falls over.

52
00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:10.954
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there."

53
00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:15.085
He says "No, it's not a lion.
It's a giraffe".

54
00:18:22.737 --> 00:18:25.608
He's completely humourless.

55
00:18:25.698 --> 00:18:28.609
You two should get on
like a house on fire.

56
00:18:30.129 --> 00:18:32.180
So who are you?

57
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.311
You're from the hospital, yeah?

58
00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:38.922
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

59
00:18:39.002 --> 00:18:41.312
I'm a bicycle courier.

60
00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:49.924
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

61
00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:53.745
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...

62
00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:55.746
I'm hallucinating or I'm...

63
00:18:57.446 --> 00:18:59.877
What's your name?

64
00:18:59.967 --> 00:19:02.058
Jim.

65
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.398
I'm Mark. This is Selena.

66
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.490
Okay, Jim.

67
00:19:16.312 --> 00:19:18.832
I've got some bad news.

68
00:19:19.222 --> 00:19:25.484
It started as rioting, and right from the
beginning you knew this was different.

69
00:19:25.674 --> 00:19:29.845
Because it was happening in
small villages, market towns.

70
00:19:30.715 --> 00:19:33.456
And then it wasn't
on the TV any more.

71
00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:38.277
It was in the street outside. It
was coming through your windows.

72
00:19:38.367 --> 00:19:40.198
It was a virus.

73
00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:42.068
An infection.

74
00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:44.979
You didn't need a doctor
to tell you that.

75
00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:47.500
It was the blood.

76
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.110
There was something
in the blood.

77
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:56.542
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

78
00:19:56.632 --> 00:19:59.543
The infection was everywhere.

79
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:02.113
The army blockades were overrun.

80
00:20:03.684 --> 00:20:06.374
And that's when the
exodus started.

81
00:20:07.765 --> 00:20:10.506
The day before the TV and
radio stopped broadcasting,

82
00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:14.247
there were reports of infection
in Paris and New York.

83
00:20:16.637 --> 00:20:19.548
We didn't hear anything
more after that.

84
00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:24.455
What about the government,
what are they doing?

85
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.493
There's no government.

86
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:28.030
Of course there's a government!

87
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.161
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

88
00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:36.552
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

89
00:20:38.033 --> 00:20:41.124
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

90
00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:45.905
You're the first uninfected
person we've seen in six days.

91
00:20:46.735 --> 00:20:48.826
Where's your family?

92
00:20:49.736 --> 00:20:51.776
They're dead. Like Selena's.

93
00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.997
Yours will be dead too.

94
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.301
Look, I have to find them. They live
in Deptford. I can walk it. Okay?

95
00:21:08.391 --> 00:21:10.961
You'll go and come back, yeah?

96
00:21:12.962 --> 00:21:15.172
- You won't.
- Yes!

97
00:21:15.262 --> 00:21:18.263
No one ever comes back.

98
00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:24.875
So lesson one.

99
00:21:25.745 --> 00:21:30.176
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

100
00:21:30.266 --> 00:21:32.567
Lesson two.

101
00:21:32.657 --> 00:21:36.748
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

102
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:40.839
We'll take you tomorrow.

103
00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:44.530
We'll all go and find your
dead parents together, okay?

104
00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.011
Eat.

105
00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:02.365
If you want her to slow
down, you'll have to say.

106
00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:30.932
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.

107
00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:33.113
- Anyone...
- I understand!

108
00:22:35.243 --> 00:22:36.764
Okay.

109
00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:19.905
Jim...

110
00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:22.076
Wait!

111
00:24:46.758 --> 00:24:50.709
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

112
00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:53.189
I'm not grateful.

113
00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.450
My...

114
00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.672
parents and my sisters, we
went to Paddington Station,

115
00:25:04.282 --> 00:25:09.624
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

116
00:25:10.284 --> 00:25:12.624
I remember my dad
had all this cash,

117
00:25:12.714 --> 00:25:16.065
even though cash was
completely useless.

118
00:25:17.586 --> 00:25:20.717
About 20,000 other people
had the same idea.

119
00:25:23.237 --> 00:25:25.458
Crowd was surging.

120
00:25:26.288 --> 00:25:28.589
I lost my grip on
my sister's hand.

121
00:25:30.769 --> 00:25:33.110
I remember the ground was soft.

122
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.461
I looked down and I was
standing on all these people.

123
00:25:39.551 --> 00:25:43.502
Like a carpet. People
who had fallen and...

124
00:25:43.592 --> 00:25:47.554
Somewhere in the crowd there were infected.
It spread fast.

125
00:25:47.634 --> 00:25:50.984
No one could run. All
you could do was climb.

126
00:25:52.595 --> 00:25:55.686
Climb over more people. So I did that.
I climbed.

127
00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:58.116
And I got up on top
of this kiosk.

128
00:26:00.427 --> 00:26:05.378
Looking down, you couldn't tell which
faces were infected and which weren't.

129
00:26:05.468 --> 00:26:09.339
Then I saw my dad. Not
my mum or my sister.

130
00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:11.430
My dad.

131
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.781
His face...

132
00:26:19.472 --> 00:26:23.383
Selena's right. You
should be grateful.

133
00:26:23.473 --> 00:26:28.604
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

134
00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:34.126
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

135
00:26:34.216 --> 00:26:37.567
No, we'll all sleep in the same room.
It's safer.

136
00:27:57.847 --> 00:27:59.938
Jim.

137
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.671
- Oh, you're back?
- Yeah.

138
00:28:17.073 --> 00:28:19.153
- How was it?
- Fine.

139
00:28:20.243 --> 00:28:22.544
Give me a drink
of that, will ya?

140
00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.674
- It's empty.
- Ha!

141
00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:29.336
- Here.
- Right.

142
00:28:31.416 --> 00:28:33.507
I'll start working
on them, then.

143
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:42.119
Mark! Mark!

144
00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:45.080
Selena! Help!

145
00:28:59.424 --> 00:29:01.474
It's clear.

146
00:29:06.956 --> 00:29:09.906
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

147
00:29:09.996 --> 00:29:12.217
And his daughter.
From four doors down.

148
00:29:12.297 --> 00:29:15.388
- Were you bitten?
- No.

149
00:29:15.478 --> 00:29:18.389
Did any of the blood
get in your mouth?

150
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:21.299
No.

151
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.171
Mark?

152
00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:30.302
Wait...

153
00:29:52.177 --> 00:29:54.398
Get that cleaned off.

154
00:29:56.268 --> 00:29:58.359
Do you have any clothes here?

155
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:01.360
Um... I... Yes.

156
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.101
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

157
00:30:05.181 --> 00:30:08.842
More infected will be coming.
They always do.

158
00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:40.630
How did you know? How
did you know he was infected?

159
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.590
The blood.

160
00:30:41.615 --> 00:30:44.755
Yeah, but there was blood everywhere,
It was on me, it was on you.

161
00:30:44.811 --> 00:30:50.112
I didn't know he was infected, okay?
He knew. I could see it in his face.

162
00:30:50.192 --> 00:30:52.231
Look, if someone gets
infected, you've got

163
00:30:52.256 --> 00:30:54.608
between ten and twenty
seconds to kill them.

164
00:30:54.674 --> 00:30:59.805
It might be your brother, or your sister or
your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

165
00:30:59.895 --> 00:31:05.326
Just so you know where you stand, if it
happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

166
00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:09.638
He was full of plans. Have
you got any plans, Jim?

167
00:31:09.718 --> 00:31:14.159
Do you want us to find a cure and save
the world or just fall in love and fuck?

168
00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:16.769
Plans are pointless.

169
00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:19.420
Staying alive's as
good as it gets.

170
00:31:21.251 --> 00:31:22.681
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

171
00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:24.862
What's that?

172
00:31:30.943 --> 00:31:33.034
Let's go.

173
00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:21.266
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys, huh?

174
00:32:21.346 --> 00:32:24.437
Stop talking. It's
a long way up.

175
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.480
- Do you need a break?
- No...

176
00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:39.701
- You?
- No.

177
00:32:42.402 --> 00:32:45.342
Now I do need a
break, by the way...

178
00:32:54.925 --> 00:32:56.745
What's up?

179
00:32:56.886 --> 00:32:58.836
Nothin'.

180
00:33:01.227 --> 00:33:02.577
I got a headache.

181
00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:04.147
- Bad?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

182
00:33:04.227 --> 00:33:05.983
Well, why didn't you
say something before?

183
00:33:06.008 --> 00:33:08.863
Well, because I didn't
think you'd give a shit.

184
00:33:10.749 --> 00:33:15.020
You've got no fat on you and all
you've had to eat is sugar.

185
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.191
So you're crashing.

186
00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:19.541
Unfortunately, there isn't
a lot we can do about that

187
00:33:19.621 --> 00:33:24.713
except pump you full of painkillers and
give you more sugar. As for sugar,

188
00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:27.103
Pepsi or Lilt?

189
00:33:28.364 --> 00:33:30.324
Do you have any Tango?

190
00:33:30.454 --> 00:33:33.455
Actually, I did have a
can of Tango somewhere.

191
00:33:34.675 --> 00:33:36.936
Quiet! That's an infected.

192
00:33:47.289 --> 00:33:49.109
Oh no, they're in. Move!

193
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.761
Wait up, Selena!

194
00:33:55.681 --> 00:33:57.681
Wait for me, please!

195
00:33:57.761 --> 00:33:59.902
Please, Selena! Please!

196
00:33:59.982 --> 00:34:02.293
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

197
00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.373
- Run!
- Wait!

198
00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:07.724
Please! For fuck's sake!

199
00:34:08.294 --> 00:34:10.555
Selena!

200
00:34:12.245 --> 00:34:15.636
Down the corridor.
Flat 157. Move!

201
00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:17.817
Thank you. Thank you.

202
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.340
Open the door!

203
00:34:37.912 --> 00:34:39.512
Open the door!

204
00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:46.694
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

205
00:34:46.824 --> 00:34:48.255
What?

206
00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:53.866
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

207
00:34:53.956 --> 00:34:56.217
Let them in, Hannah.
Let them inside.

208
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:06.439
Go in. Go in!

209
00:35:24.484 --> 00:35:26.925
So, I'm Frank, anyway.

210
00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:28.785
Jim.

211
00:35:29.615 --> 00:35:32.706
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

212
00:35:32.786 --> 00:35:35.097
This is my daughter Hannah.

213
00:35:35.187 --> 00:35:37.447
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

214
00:35:38.838 --> 00:35:40.928
Come on.

215
00:35:41.709 --> 00:35:43.659
So...

216
00:35:43.749 --> 00:35:45.660
This is great. Just great.

217
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.271
Calls for a
celebration, I'd say.

218
00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:53.402
Why don't you all
sit down and...

219
00:35:53.492 --> 00:35:56.452
Hannah, what've we
got-what've we got to offer?

220
00:35:56.532 --> 00:35:59.013
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

221
00:35:59.143 --> 00:36:01.844
Great. Creme de menthe.

222
00:36:01.934 --> 00:36:04.624
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

223
00:36:04.715 --> 00:36:07.195
Get comfortable.

224
00:36:10.016 --> 00:36:13.017
- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

225
00:36:13.107 --> 00:36:15.977
Nah, the good ones.
It's a celebration.

226
00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:18.538
Top cupboard.

227
00:36:18.628 --> 00:36:21.369
So this is your place?

228
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:24.370
It's nice.

229
00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:38.633
There.

230
00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:41.854
I know it isn't much
but, well, cheers.

231
00:36:41.944 --> 00:36:43.675
Cheers.

232
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.251
You okay in there, Jim?

233
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:10.552
Yeah.

234
00:37:10.642 --> 00:37:16.253
Sorry we couldn't spare the water. Same
with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

235
00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:20.164
You'll have to use the bucket.

236
00:37:26.736 --> 00:37:29.347
Have to empty it each
morning, you know.

237
00:37:29.427 --> 00:37:33.088
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

238
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:34.468
It's fine.

239
00:37:34.558 --> 00:37:37.689
Yeah, all right. Listen, it's late.
We're gonna turn in.

240
00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:42.130
We have a spare room.

241
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.481
In there.

242
00:37:44.561 --> 00:37:46.521
Are you and Selena...?

243
00:37:47.781 --> 00:37:49.612
No. No, no, no.

244
00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:51.352
Um...

245
00:37:51.432 --> 00:37:53.823
I'll take the living room.
It's fine.

246
00:37:53.913 --> 00:37:55.783
Right.

247
00:37:56.654 --> 00:37:58.744
No, I mean, yeah.

248
00:37:59.785 --> 00:38:01.785
So, um...

249
00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:05.826
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

250
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.010
Very spruce.

251
00:38:23.361 --> 00:38:26.181
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

252
00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:34.234
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

253
00:38:35.364 --> 00:38:38.185
Probably need us more
than we need them.

254
00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:41.886
I think they're good people.

255
00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:47.707
- Good people?
- Yeah.

256
00:38:49.698 --> 00:38:51.557
Well, that's nice, but you
should be more concerned

257
00:38:51.582 --> 00:38:53.638
about whether they're
gonna slow you down.

258
00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:58.020
- Right, because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

259
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.020
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

260
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.371
I wouldn't.

261
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:06.022
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

262
00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:16.845
I'm gonna get some sleep.

263
00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:21.246
Selena...

264
00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:25.327
You think I don't get it, but...
I do get it.

265
00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:31.198
And I know I'd be dead
already if I hadn't met you.

266
00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:33.289
Sure.

267
00:39:33.379 --> 00:39:34.939
No, look...

268
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.421
I mean, thank you.

269
00:39:42.591 --> 00:39:44.772
And I mean, sure.

270
00:39:44.852 --> 00:39:47.643
Goodnight, Jim.

271
00:39:47.723 --> 00:39:49.813
Goodnight.

272
00:40:03.427 --> 00:40:05.467
We lost water pressure
three weeks ago.

273
00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:07.983
For while I thought we'd be okay
with the water from the other flats.

274
00:40:08.008 --> 00:40:09.036
Cisterns and tanks.

275
00:40:09.778 --> 00:40:12.999
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

276
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.001
You drink it,

277
00:40:18.081 --> 00:40:19.861
it evaporates,

278
00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:22.042
turns stagnant.

279
00:40:24.432 --> 00:40:26.523
They're all empty.

280
00:40:27.393 --> 00:40:29.394
Hasn't rained in ten days.

281
00:40:29.474 --> 00:40:33.735
You can set up a plastic sheet to catch
dew and condensation, trap it somehow...

282
00:40:33.825 --> 00:40:37.566
Saw it on TV once, but
I can't make it work.

283
00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:41.007
You'd never think it.

284
00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:44.868
Needing rain so badly.

285
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:48.959
Not in fucking England!

286
00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.741
Jim, we're not gonna
be able to stay here.

287
00:41:05.703 --> 00:41:07.793
There haven't been any
broadcasts for weeks.

288
00:41:07.818 --> 00:41:09.168
Just listen.

289
00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:14.095
Salvation is here.
The answer to infection is here.

290
00:41:14.185 --> 00:41:17.186
If you can hear this,
you're not alone.

291
00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:21.797
There are others like you...
There are other survivors.

292
00:41:21.877 --> 00:41:24.058
We are soldiers
and we are armed.

293
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:27.449
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

294
00:41:27.539 --> 00:41:32.100
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

295
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.621
27 miles northeast
of Manchester.

296
00:41:35.711 --> 00:41:39.622
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.

297
00:41:39.712 --> 00:41:42.103
- Why, 'cause it's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

298
00:41:42.193 --> 00:41:45.103
But this is where it's
telling us to go.

299
00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:47.324
Just there.

300
00:41:48.844 --> 00:41:53.626
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

301
00:41:53.716 --> 00:41:55.456
"We"?

302
00:41:59.547 --> 00:42:05.629
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

303
00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:08.850
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's okay. It's the truth.

304
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.460
I can't leave the block if
it's just the two of us.

305
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.501
Something might happen to me. Hannah'd
be alone. I couldn't risk it.

306
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:17.292
But with other people...

307
00:42:17.372 --> 00:42:21.683
If it's a recording, for all we know,
the soldiers who made it are dead.

308
00:42:21.763 --> 00:42:22.812
It's possible, yeah...

309
00:42:22.837 --> 00:42:25.068
And that stuff about the
answer to infection...

310
00:42:25.134 --> 00:42:27.097
I mean, there is no
answer to infection!

311
00:42:27.122 --> 00:42:29.659
It's already done pretty
much all the damage it can!

312
00:42:29.725 --> 00:42:32.556
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing at all!

313
00:42:32.636 --> 00:42:36.727
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

314
00:42:38.817 --> 00:42:41.118
Or die here.

315
00:42:41.208 --> 00:42:46.899
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

316
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.300
We need each other.

317
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:55.642
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

318
00:42:56.382 --> 00:42:58.472
So we have to try and get there.

319
00:42:59.603 --> 00:43:01.173
Get there how?

320
00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:16.347
Just so you know, I don't
take cheques or credit cards.

321
00:43:44.915 --> 00:43:45.745
What do you think?

322
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.939
Well, it's the most direct route
to the her side of the river.

323
00:43:48.005 --> 00:43:50.247
No, no, no. Then we should
take the indirect route.

324
00:43:50.272 --> 00:43:53.291
The one it's in broad daylight
and it's not underground.

325
00:43:53.357 --> 00:43:55.657
Let's just get it done.

326
00:44:08.621 --> 00:44:10.791
No, no.

327
00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:13.362
No. See, see, this is
a really shit idea.

328
00:44:14.232 --> 00:44:17.623
You know why? Because it's
really obviously a shit idea.

329
00:44:17.713 --> 00:44:22.104
So we're just gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars and...

330
00:44:22.194 --> 00:44:25.105
It's really fucking
obviously a shit idea!

331
00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:27.406
Hold on!

332
00:44:36.588 --> 00:44:38.499
Dad!

333
00:44:57.934 --> 00:44:59.464
Fuck!

334
00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.155
The world's worst place
to get a flat, huh?

335
00:45:03.245 --> 00:45:06.596
Agreed. I think we'd
better do this quick.

336
00:45:09.117 --> 00:45:11.247
I've got the wheel.
You're on the jack.

337
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:29.382
Do you hear that? Hey,
hey, do you hear that?

338
00:45:29.512 --> 00:45:31.552
Hear what?

339
00:45:32.253 --> 00:45:34.513
Right, I've done it.

340
00:45:36.124 --> 00:45:37.604
Dad?

341
00:45:41.475 --> 00:45:44.556
Jesus Christ!

342
00:45:44.646 --> 00:45:46.166
Fucking rats!

343
00:45:56.739 --> 00:45:59.300
They're running
from the infected.

344
00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.300
Move it!

345
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.691
Forget the jack, Hannah. There's no time.
Forget the jack. Just lift, everyone.

346
00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:09.042
Grab hold! One,
two, three, lift!

347
00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:14.954
Lift, lift!

348
00:46:15.484 --> 00:46:20.615
- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!

349
00:46:26.357 --> 00:46:28.917
Come on, Hannah!

350
00:46:29.007 --> 00:46:31.398
Almost.

351
00:46:31.528 --> 00:46:34.439
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.

352
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.881
Three, two, one,

353
00:46:41.961 --> 00:46:43.701
drop it!

354
00:46:47.832 --> 00:46:50.273
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

355
00:46:52.363 --> 00:46:54.754
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

356
00:46:57.665 --> 00:46:59.755
Whoo!

357
00:47:04.537 --> 00:47:06.627
Goodbye, you fuckers!

358
00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:16.890
Hey, Frank, Frank, stop the cab.

359
00:47:39.896 --> 00:47:42.156
Let's shop.

360
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:54.290
You...

361
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.590
You...

362
00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.511
You...

363
00:47:58.591 --> 00:48:01.161
Anybody seen any buns?

364
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:04.072
Hmm. Irradiated.

365
00:48:06.773 --> 00:48:10.334
Don't take anything that
needs to be cooked, okay?

366
00:48:10.464 --> 00:48:12.294
I think you can eat that raw.

367
00:48:12.384 --> 00:48:14.255
Decaffeinated coffee, tea...

368
00:48:14.335 --> 00:48:16.385
Put that back.

369
00:48:17.596 --> 00:48:19.856
Can't just take any crap.

370
00:48:19.946 --> 00:48:24.468
If I never see another chocolate
bar again, it'll be too soon.

371
00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:27.558
Not counting Terry's
Chocolate Orange!

372
00:48:29.169 --> 00:48:32.780
Now, single malt, 16-year-old,
dark, full flavour.

373
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.730
Warm but not aggressive.

374
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.301
Peaty aftertaste.

375
00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:44.133
Takes out the fire but
leaves in the warmth.

376
00:49:39.057 --> 00:49:42.098
Either we do this now
or we're walking.

377
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.190
Not you.

378
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.842
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

379
00:49:56.932 --> 00:49:59.012
You heard.

380
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.680
Where are you going?

381
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.161
We've got enough food, Jim.

382
00:50:31.241 --> 00:50:33.591
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

383
00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:37.022
Like going on holidays
with your fuckin' aunt!

384
00:51:16.212 --> 00:51:18.693
Oh, Jesus.

385
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.040
Hello?

386
00:51:59.834 --> 00:52:01.614
I hate you!

387
00:52:10.787 --> 00:52:12.877
Find anything?

388
00:52:15.138 --> 00:52:17.918
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

389
00:52:18.008 --> 00:52:20.099
Okay, we're done here.

390
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.190
Okay, Hannah.

391
00:52:31.582 --> 00:52:33.232
Easy. Brake!

392
00:52:33.322 --> 00:52:35.403
Brake, brake!

393
00:52:43.275 --> 00:52:45.326
Out.

394
00:53:29.937 --> 00:53:33.118
Mmmm! Oh my God!

395
00:53:33.898 --> 00:53:36.899
I wanna, like, taste
the vitamin C.

396
00:53:37.729 --> 00:53:40.510
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

397
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.811
What did you say?

398
00:53:43.901 --> 00:53:46.682
The raisins. They're so moist.

399
00:53:51.473 --> 00:53:53.513
Look over here.

400
00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:06.687
Like a family.

401
00:54:06.777 --> 00:54:09.217
Do you think
they're infected?

402
00:54:09.648 --> 00:54:11.738
No.

403
00:54:15.169 --> 00:54:17.910
They're doing just fine.

404
00:54:23.651 --> 00:54:25.742
- Come on. Let's eat!
- Let's eat!

405
00:54:40.436 --> 00:54:41.746
Know what I was thinking?

406
00:54:41.826 --> 00:54:45.527
You were thinking that you'll never hear
another piece of original music ever again.

407
00:54:45.617 --> 00:54:49.788
You'll never read a book that
hasn't already been written,

408
00:54:50.828 --> 00:54:54.659
or see a film that hasn't
already been shot.

409
00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.441
Um... that's what
you were thinking.

410
00:55:02.531 --> 00:55:04.402
No.

411
00:55:05.662 --> 00:55:07.923
I was thinking I was wrong.

412
00:55:09.183 --> 00:55:11.274
About what?

413
00:55:13.014 --> 00:55:15.055
All the death.

414
00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:17.755
All this shit.

415
00:55:19.366 --> 00:55:23.887
It doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

416
00:55:25.277 --> 00:55:28.708
Well, she's got her dad and
he's got his daughter. So...

417
00:55:28.798 --> 00:55:30.929
Cheeky monkey!

418
00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:35.020
I was wrong when I said staying
alive is as good as it gets.

419
00:55:38.631 --> 00:55:41.151
See, that's what I was thinking.

420
00:55:41.632 --> 00:55:43.322
Was it?

421
00:55:43.412 --> 00:55:45.673
Mmm. You stole my thought.

422
00:55:50.894 --> 00:55:52.764
Sorry.

423
00:55:53.765 --> 00:55:55.635
That's okay.

424
00:55:55.715 --> 00:55:57.766
You can keep it.

425
00:55:58.936 --> 00:56:02.897
It's getting late. I think we'd
better stay here for the night.

426
00:56:17.981 --> 00:56:20.512
I can't sleep.

427
00:56:20.592 --> 00:56:23.252
Me neither.

428
00:56:23.332 --> 00:56:25.683
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

429
00:56:25.773 --> 00:56:27.854
Outside like this.

430
00:56:28.724 --> 00:56:31.164
I think we're safe enough.

431
00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:33.905
Selena didn't seem
to have any trouble.

432
00:56:34.595 --> 00:56:37.116
Yeah, I noticed that.

433
00:56:37.206 --> 00:56:38.686
Hey, Selena...

434
00:56:38.776 --> 00:56:40.857
What? What is it?

435
00:56:42.207 --> 00:56:44.258
How'd you get to sleep?

436
00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:54.601
Bloody hell. Must've needed a hell
of a prescription for that lot.

437
00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:58.992
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

438
00:56:59.042 --> 00:57:01.602
Oh, great. Valium.

439
00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:04.263
Not only will we be
able to get to sleep

440
00:57:04.343 --> 00:57:08.044
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

441
00:57:08.174 --> 00:57:10.395
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

442
00:57:10.475 --> 00:57:12.525
Can I, Dad?

443
00:57:12.605 --> 00:57:14.606
I don't think so, sweetheart.

444
00:57:14.696 --> 00:57:16.176
Please?

445
00:57:17.697 --> 00:57:19.787
- No.
- I can't sleep.

446
00:57:22.868 --> 00:57:25.569
Come on, Frank. Let
her live a little.

447
00:57:26.659 --> 00:57:30.660
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

448
00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:43.313
Night-night.

449
00:57:44.094 --> 00:57:46.744
You're a big softie, Frank.

450
00:58:17.362 --> 00:58:19.323
Frank?

451
00:58:19.413 --> 00:58:21.453
Hannah?

452
00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:23.454
Frank?

453
00:58:29.065 --> 00:58:31.146
Hello? Hello!

454
00:58:32.196 --> 00:58:33.456
Hello!

455
00:58:33.546 --> 00:58:36.017
Hello! Hello!

456
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:46.200
Shh...

457
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.371
You're having a bad
dream, that's all.

458
00:58:53.112 --> 00:58:55.202
Thanks, Dad.

459
00:59:30.511 --> 00:59:33.082
Come on, sleepyhead.

460
00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:38.823
Come on, Babe Ruth.

461
00:59:42.034 --> 00:59:43.955
Hurry up.

462
00:59:45.695 --> 00:59:47.802
Oh, no. Did I miss breakfast?

463
00:59:47.827 --> 00:59:49.190
You'll sleep
through anything, you.

464
00:59:49.256 --> 00:59:50.675
Did you have a fry-up?

465
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.881
We'll stop at a
pub on the way. Door!

466
01:00:18.834 --> 01:00:23.355
Our location is the
42nd blockade, the M602,

467
01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:26.526
27 miles northeast
of Manchester.

468
01:00:26.616 --> 01:00:28.526
You must find us. Please!

469
01:00:28.616 --> 01:00:30.747
Salvation is here.

470
01:00:30.837 --> 01:00:33.838
The answer to infection is here.

471
01:01:05.886 --> 01:01:07.977
Must be Manchester.

472
01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:13.538
The whole of Manchester,
the whole city.

473
01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:17.719
No fire crews to put it out.

474
01:02:12.554 --> 01:02:15.124
42nd blockade.

475
01:02:15.204 --> 01:02:17.555
This is it.

476
01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:32.704
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

477
01:03:32.794 --> 01:03:35.925
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!

478
01:03:42.757 --> 01:03:47.578
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

479
01:04:05.763 --> 01:04:07.634
Nothing.

480
01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:09.634
I can't believe it.

481
01:04:09.764 --> 01:04:11.715
Frank...

482
01:04:12.155 --> 01:04:14.025
Frank!

483
01:04:16.236 --> 01:04:17.896
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

484
01:04:18.026 --> 01:04:20.507
Go fucking where?!

485
01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:01.778
Get out of it.

486
01:05:05.299 --> 01:05:07.389
Get out of it!

487
01:05:25.214 --> 01:05:27.784
Dad, are you all right?

488
01:05:27.864 --> 01:05:30.525
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

489
01:05:31.435 --> 01:05:34.176
Sorry I lost my temper.

490
01:05:34.256 --> 01:05:36.347
Hannah...

491
01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:39.398
I love you very much.

492
01:05:39.478 --> 01:05:41.478
- What?
- Keep away from me.

493
01:05:41.568 --> 01:05:43.919
Stay where you are.

494
01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:46.919
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

495
01:05:46.999 --> 01:05:49.480
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

496
01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:52.701
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

497
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:56.962
What's wrong? Dad!

498
01:06:01.263 --> 01:06:03.664
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

499
01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:06.405
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

500
01:06:06.485 --> 01:06:09.925
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

501
01:06:10.005 --> 01:06:11.266
Kill him!

502
01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:22.059
Stay away from him!

503
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:25.710
Keep away from the body!

504
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.361
Dad?

505
01:06:52.757 --> 01:06:55.417
Three survivors.
One male, two female.

506
01:06:55.497 --> 01:06:58.848
I repeat, one male, two female.

507
01:06:58.938 --> 01:07:01.499
ETA, 15.

508
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:04.020
Put the kettle on.

509
01:07:51.992 --> 01:07:54.513
I'm Major Henry West.

510
01:07:55.773 --> 01:07:57.474
- Welcome.
- Jim.

511
01:07:57.564 --> 01:07:59.564
Hello, Jim.

512
01:07:59.644 --> 01:08:01.385
Hello.

513
01:08:03.645 --> 01:08:08.516
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

514
01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:10.997
So you can all have a shower.

515
01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:14.438
You look like you need one.
Please.

516
01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:39.615
It ain't funny. I got loads of
cooking to do, you fucking Doris!

517
01:08:40.705 --> 01:08:42.785
Run him over!

518
01:08:45.526 --> 01:08:48.307
How is she doing?

519
01:08:48.397 --> 01:08:51.578
Well, she's lost her dad, Jim.
That's how she is.

520
01:08:54.228 --> 01:08:56.749
It's all fucked.

521
01:08:56.839 --> 01:08:58.840
What do you mean?

522
01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:07.452
Oh, don't do that, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on...

523
01:09:07.532 --> 01:09:09.622
Hey, don't do that.

524
01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.682
Look, Hannah is what Frank
says she is, okay? She is...

525
01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:16.298
...she is tough and she is strong
and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

526
01:09:16.404 --> 01:09:20.315
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

527
01:09:21.585 --> 01:09:24.016
I want her to be okay.

528
01:09:25.587 --> 01:09:27.757
When Hannah had her
dad it was okay.

529
01:09:27.847 --> 01:09:30.628
It was okay for them and
it was okay for us.

530
01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:36.409
Now it's all just fucked.

531
01:10:07.858 --> 01:10:10.678
So you heard our broadcast?

532
01:10:10.768 --> 01:10:14.289
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

533
01:10:14.379 --> 01:10:20.471
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

534
01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:27.073
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to infection.

535
01:10:29.423 --> 01:10:31.514
Yeah.

536
01:10:31.604 --> 01:10:36.075
Well, as I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

537
01:10:36.475 --> 01:10:39.386
- Just feel very lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

538
01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:42.607
The fire drove hundreds of
infected out of Manchester.

539
01:10:42.687 --> 01:10:45.777
The surrounding area's
teeming with them.

540
01:10:47.518 --> 01:10:50.129
But don't worry.

541
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:52.739
You're quite safe here.

542
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.197
Flat terrain all
round the house.

543
01:10:58.222 --> 01:11:01.716
Floodlights which we've
rigged up to a generator.

544
01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:05.603
High perimeter wall which helps.

545
01:11:05.693 --> 01:11:09.954
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

546
01:11:10.044 --> 01:11:14.695
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

547
01:11:17.956 --> 01:11:22.867
Secondary to protection, our real
job is to rebuild. Start again.

548
01:11:22.997 --> 01:11:25.388
The belly of the house.
The heart.

549
01:11:25.478 --> 01:11:30.739
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

550
01:11:30.829 --> 01:11:32.920
The kitchen.

551
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.130
Here you are. I'll swap you.

552
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.391
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

553
01:11:38.481 --> 01:11:42.522
Don't be fighting. Will you put that back?
Put it back.

554
01:11:42.612 --> 01:11:45.003
Jones, our resident tin opener.

555
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.094
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

556
01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.794
I can't wait.

557
01:11:58.316 --> 01:12:00.527
And lastly, meet Mailer.

558
01:12:04.358 --> 01:12:06.318
Mailer, Jim.

559
01:12:06.398 --> 01:12:08.529
Jim, Mailer.

560
01:12:09.879 --> 01:12:12.400
Got infected two days ago.

561
01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:17.581
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

562
01:12:22.193 --> 01:12:24.273
Keeping him alive?

563
01:12:25.233 --> 01:12:29.274
The idea was to learn
something about infection.

564
01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:32.215
Have him teach me.

565
01:12:39.407 --> 01:12:41.458
And has he?

566
01:12:43.628 --> 01:12:45.809
In a way.

567
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.411
He's telling me he'll
never bake bread.

568
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:57.632
Farm crops,

569
01:12:57.762 --> 01:13:00.413
raise livestock.

570
01:13:00.503 --> 01:13:02.893
He's telling me he's futureless.

571
01:13:07.024 --> 01:13:12.416
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the infected take to starve to death.

572
01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.647
You'll have to wait and see

573
01:13:54.737 --> 01:13:56.957
Hope it's chips, it's chips

574
01:13:57.037 --> 01:13:59.608
We hope it's chips, it's chips

575
01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:10.611
Hat.

576
01:14:10.691 --> 01:14:13.172
So, what have we here?

577
01:14:16.042 --> 01:14:19.393
Tinned ham, tinned peas,
tinned beans and...

578
01:14:24.174 --> 01:14:26.915
- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

579
01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:29.436
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

580
01:14:29.526 --> 01:14:32.747
Absolutely. I was going
to propose a toast

581
01:14:32.837 --> 01:14:35.967
but this omelette
will do just as well.

582
01:14:38.568 --> 01:14:41.049
- To new friends.
- New friends.

583
01:14:51.532 --> 01:14:55.443
Jones, did you notice while
cooking that these eggs were off?

584
01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.923
I thought the salt might
cover the taste, sir.

585
01:14:59.014 --> 01:15:00.924
Get rid of it.

586
01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.845
Doris, you twat.

587
01:15:05.925 --> 01:15:08.706
I don't suppose you
can cook, can you?

588
01:15:09.536 --> 01:15:15.018
I can't tell you how badly we need someone
with a little flair in the kitchen.

589
01:15:15.108 --> 01:15:19.629
What a fucking disappointment. I saw
those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

590
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:22.980
We'll have eggs again. Once
everything's back to normal.

591
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.891
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

592
01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:29.422
He's still waiting for Marks
and Spencer's to reopen.

593
01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:33.113
- Listen mate, you don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

594
01:15:34.543 --> 01:15:37.634
If you look at the whole
life of the planet,

595
01:15:37.714 --> 01:15:39.634
we...

596
01:15:39.714 --> 01:15:43.855
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

597
01:15:44.635 --> 01:15:47.066
So if the infection
wipes us all out,

598
01:15:48.066 --> 01:15:50.377
that is a return to normality.

599
01:15:54.378 --> 01:15:57.379
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

600
01:15:57.459 --> 01:16:00.720
Have you met our
New Age sergeant?

601
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.510
Our spiritual guru.

602
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:08.812
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why did you
join the army in the first place?

603
01:16:11.592 --> 01:16:15.724
This is what I've seen in the
four weeks since infection.

604
01:16:15.814 --> 01:16:18.424
People killing people.

605
01:16:18.514 --> 01:16:21.028
Which is much what I saw in the
four weeks before infection

606
01:16:21.053 --> 01:16:23.023
and the four weeks before
that and before that...

607
01:16:23.065 --> 01:16:28.497
As far back as I care to
remember, people killing people.

608
01:16:28.687 --> 01:16:32.338
Which to my mind puts us in a
state of normality right now.

609
01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:43.601
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

610
01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:46.472
You must eat, Hannah.

611
01:16:46.562 --> 01:16:49.822
I don't want to eat. I
want to bury my dad.

612
01:16:50.733 --> 01:16:53.823
He's one of the people
you're talking about.

613
01:16:57.955 --> 01:17:00.005
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

614
01:17:00.695 --> 01:17:03.006
Move!

615
01:17:03.136 --> 01:17:05.396
Move! Move! Move!

616
01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:16.349
Enemy in front!

617
01:17:49.188 --> 01:17:51.709
Mick, I fucking got one!

618
01:17:51.799 --> 01:17:55.410
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

619
01:18:08.063 --> 01:18:10.323
Fucking hell! He bounced!

620
01:18:10.413 --> 01:18:12.024
Cease fire!

621
01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.364
I ain't never seen that
in my fuckin' life!

622
01:18:14.494 --> 01:18:17.155
- Report clear!
- Fuckin' hell!

623
01:18:17.235 --> 01:18:18.936
- Clear.
- Clear.

624
01:18:19.026 --> 01:18:20.156
Yeah, yeah, clear.

625
01:18:30.759 --> 01:18:32.809
Oh, hello!

626
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:42.682
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't gonna
be needing this any more, right?

627
01:18:42.762 --> 01:18:44.942
Cos you got me to
protect you now.

628
01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:52.034
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

629
01:18:52.164 --> 01:18:53.595
Fuck you!

630
01:18:53.685 --> 01:18:55.855
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

631
01:18:55.945 --> 01:18:57.946
How about right now?

632
01:18:58.596 --> 01:19:00.466
Mitchell!

633
01:19:02.077 --> 01:19:06.558
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

634
01:19:07.858 --> 01:19:10.469
Sergeant Farrell!

635
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.341
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

636
01:19:17.431 --> 01:19:20.862
Then get to it. Jones,
Bedford, go with him.

637
01:19:23.082 --> 01:19:25.173
Slow down.

638
01:19:28.304 --> 01:19:31.255
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

639
01:19:31.345 --> 01:19:34.045
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

640
01:19:36.956 --> 01:19:39.517
The rest of you, go with him.

641
01:19:46.699 --> 01:19:48.779
My apologies.

642
01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.261
Drink?

643
01:19:59.182 --> 01:20:01.833
Look, we're grateful, okay?

644
01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:04.169
We're very grateful for your
protection and just having

645
01:20:04.194 --> 01:20:06.158
found new people but if
we're gonna stay here...

646
01:20:06.224 --> 01:20:07.744
- Who've you killed?
- I haven't killed no one.

647
01:20:07.834 --> 01:20:09.905
Since it began who've you killed?
You wouldn't be alive now

648
01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.129
if you hadn't killed somebody.

649
01:20:20.267 --> 01:20:23.398
I killed... I killed a boy.

650
01:20:27.749 --> 01:20:29.790
A child?

651
01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:33.271
Yes.

652
01:20:35.061 --> 01:20:39.842
But you had to. Otherwise
he'd have killed you.

653
01:20:43.363 --> 01:20:45.234
Survival.

654
01:20:48.665 --> 01:20:50.755
I understand.

655
01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:55.627
I promised them women.

656
01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:59.668
What?

657
01:21:00.798 --> 01:21:04.589
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

658
01:21:05.759 --> 01:21:10.500
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

659
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:13.461
What could I say to him?

660
01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:18.723
We fight off the infected or we wait until
they starve to death and then what?

661
01:21:19.673 --> 01:21:23.504
What do nine men do except
wait to die themselves?

662
01:21:23.594 --> 01:21:26.773
I moved us from the blockade,
I set the radio broadcasting

663
01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:29.649
and I promised them women.

664
01:21:34.077 --> 01:21:36.417
Because women mean a future.

665
01:21:44.419 --> 01:21:46.510
Selena! Hannah!

666
01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.080
- What is it, Jim?
- We have to go.

667
01:21:49.161 --> 01:21:51.211
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

668
01:21:54.212 --> 01:21:56.252
Come on!

669
01:21:57.383 --> 01:21:59.343
We get in the car and we go!

670
01:22:00.684 --> 01:22:05.255
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

671
01:22:05.345 --> 01:22:08.606
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

672
01:22:08.686 --> 01:22:11.386
I'm not gonna let
you keep them here!

673
01:22:11.476 --> 01:22:13.387
You can't do this!

674
01:22:15.957 --> 01:22:18.258
Right, get him!

675
01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.651
I want to give you a chance.

676
01:22:27.741 --> 01:22:29.871
You can be with us.

677
01:22:31.482 --> 01:22:33.782
But I can't let them go.

678
01:22:39.394 --> 01:22:42.004
Okay, Jim? Okay.

679
01:22:46.656 --> 01:22:48.746
Him too.

680
01:23:01.829 --> 01:23:04.620
Smithers says "Women
and semen don't mix."

681
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.621
And Mr. Burns says "We all know
what you think, Smithers."

682
01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:10.622
And that was my favourite
joke in The Simpsons.

683
01:23:10.702 --> 01:23:14.313
That's what they're doing a few hundred
miles away, across the Channel,

684
01:23:14.403 --> 01:23:18.834
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

685
01:23:18.924 --> 01:23:22.185
They're sleeping in their
beds next to their wives.

686
01:23:22.275 --> 01:23:27.976
But we're here chained to a fucking
radiator because the OC has gone insane!

687
01:23:29.057 --> 01:23:33.108
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

688
01:23:34.448 --> 01:23:37.579
Just imagine, just
think about it.

689
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:40.930
How could infection
cross the oceans?

690
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:45.321
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? It can be stopped.

691
01:23:45.411 --> 01:23:47.712
Right now TVs are playing and
planes are flying in the sky

692
01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:51.793
and the rest of the world is
continuing as fucking normal.

693
01:23:52.283 --> 01:23:55.633
Think! Actually think about it.

694
01:23:56.504 --> 01:24:00.065
What would you do with a
diseased little island?

695
01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:06.326
They quarantined us.

696
01:24:08.847 --> 01:24:13.198
"There is no infection. It's just
people killing people". He's insane!

697
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.461
Time to go.

698
01:24:25.851 --> 01:24:27.942
Quarantine?

699
01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:02.861
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.

700
01:25:03.951 --> 01:25:09.083
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.

701
01:25:09.173 --> 01:25:13.084
Mitchell, I swear to God it's
gonna end badly for you.

702
01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.914
Move.

703
01:25:15.004 --> 01:25:16.865
Come on, move! Get up!

704
01:25:16.955 --> 01:25:19.005
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

705
01:25:19.135 --> 01:25:20.656
Get up!

706
01:25:20.736 --> 01:25:23.006
Move your fucking arse!

707
01:25:44.012 --> 01:25:47.443
Come on then, you
fucking pansies. Do me first.

708
01:25:47.533 --> 01:25:50.013
No, Mitch.
Mitch, just use the gat.

709
01:25:50.093 --> 01:25:51.933
So you're gonna stick
me, Mitchell, is that it?

710
01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:52.768
Mitchell, shoot 'em!

711
01:25:53.224 --> 01:25:55.875
- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

712
01:25:55.965 --> 01:25:59.016
Is that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

713
01:25:59.096 --> 01:26:01.016
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

714
01:26:01.096 --> 01:26:04.577
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

715
01:26:08.188 --> 01:26:10.059
I'm gonna enjoy this.

716
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.841
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
What? You wanna shoot me?

717
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:22.102
- You wanna shoot me? I'll fucking kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

718
01:26:23.362 --> 01:26:26.193
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

719
01:26:28.673 --> 01:26:31.884
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!

720
01:26:31.974 --> 01:26:34.065
Where are you?

721
01:26:41.677 --> 01:26:43.547
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

722
01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:54.810
Oh no. We're fucked.

723
01:26:55.981 --> 01:26:57.501
We're fucked!

724
01:26:57.591 --> 01:26:58.981
Relax.

725
01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:02.502
He's over the wall.
He's got no vehicle.

726
01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:05.333
And no shooter.

727
01:27:05.423 --> 01:27:06.763
He's dead.

728
01:27:41.562 --> 01:27:42.781
Now, the first
thing we're going to do

729
01:27:42.806 --> 01:27:44.937
is make you look a
little more presentable.

730
01:27:45.003 --> 01:27:48.574
It's so happens that the lady of the
house has an extensive wardrobe,

731
01:27:49.254 --> 01:27:51.825
which she certainly
has no use for.

732
01:27:52.825 --> 01:27:54.646
- You can't do it to Hannah.
- No.

733
01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:58.437
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

734
01:27:58.517 --> 01:28:00.607
Yes, sir.

735
01:28:03.998 --> 01:28:06.049
No...

736
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:09.180
Ladies...

737
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.741
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

738
01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:18.182
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

739
01:28:18.262 --> 01:28:19.872
Selena!

740
01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:22.053
Whoa, whoa, relax!

741
01:28:23.133 --> 01:28:24.704
Selena!

742
01:28:32.446 --> 01:28:34.876
Selena! Selena!

743
01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:41.058
You need to leave me
alone with Hannah. Okay?

744
01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:46.659
- Listen, all right, the OC... wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

745
01:28:46.749 --> 01:28:50.881
If you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. Okay?

746
01:29:01.883 --> 01:29:04.234
It's just polite.

747
01:29:10.236 --> 01:29:12.756
Yeah, all right.

748
01:29:12.846 --> 01:29:14.587
All right.

749
01:29:14.667 --> 01:29:17.537
Come on, lads. Let's
leave the room.

750
01:29:40.634 --> 01:29:44.595
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, okay?
Come on. Eat these.

751
01:29:44.675 --> 01:29:46.805
Are you trying to kill me?

752
01:29:46.985 --> 01:29:49.156
No, sweetheart.

753
01:29:49.246 --> 01:29:51.806
I'm making you not care. Okay?

754
01:29:53.117 --> 01:29:55.337
What you doing?!

755
01:29:59.899 --> 01:30:02.379
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

756
01:30:02.469 --> 01:30:03.680
Move!

757
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:06.420
Stay here and put
the dresses on.

758
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:08.081
Well, let's go! Go!

759
01:30:12.292 --> 01:30:14.862
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

760
01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:17.643
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

761
01:32:26.157 --> 01:32:28.247
Davis?

762
01:33:02.946 --> 01:33:04.777
Fuck it!

763
01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:59.661
- What was that?
- Lightning.

764
01:34:00.611 --> 01:34:02.662
I heard something.

765
01:34:04.922 --> 01:34:07.403
It sounded like a
Claymore to me.

766
01:34:08.443 --> 01:34:12.404
All right, I'll go and hit the
floods, take a butcher's.

767
01:34:13.185 --> 01:34:15.055
Girls,

768
01:34:15.145 --> 01:34:17.796
keep an eye on him, will ya?

769
01:34:28.449 --> 01:34:30.879
Those pills,

770
01:34:30.969 --> 01:34:33.450
I think they're
having an effect.

771
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:36.061
I can feel them. And...

772
01:34:37.191 --> 01:34:39.541
I don't feel sleepy.

773
01:34:39.622 --> 01:34:41.712
But...

774
01:34:44.583 --> 01:34:47.103
They've been a long time.

775
01:34:49.014 --> 01:34:51.885
What are you gonna do if
they don't come back?

776
01:34:52.625 --> 01:34:55.716
Would you be the officer
if Henry was dead?

777
01:34:55.806 --> 01:34:57.806
Is that the way it works?

778
01:34:57.886 --> 01:34:59.977
Shut up.

779
01:35:01.367 --> 01:35:05.458
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.

780
01:35:05.548 --> 01:35:08.109
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...

781
01:35:09.719 --> 01:35:11.760
They're dead.

782
01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:15.331
And you're gonna be next.

783
01:35:21.502 --> 01:35:23.813
- Get up!
- Whoa!

784
01:35:24.373 --> 01:35:27.504
We're gonna get out of here. Stay
with that, Hannah. Stay with it.

785
01:35:27.594 --> 01:35:30.425
Don't worry. I feel fine.
Really.

786
01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:33.816
Get him off me!

787
01:35:35.026 --> 01:35:37.297
Get him off me!

788
01:35:39.207 --> 01:35:41.118
It's Jones! It's Jones!

789
01:35:52.511 --> 01:35:58.032
Oi! Where the fuck are you going, oi?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

790
01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:09.385
Well, don't just stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

791
01:36:09.475 --> 01:36:11.475
You two, in there! Move!

792
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.741
Come on, then!

793
01:36:31.831 --> 01:36:34.782
What the fuck you gonna do now?

794
01:36:55.487 --> 01:36:57.618
Come on up!

795
01:36:58.528 --> 01:37:00.228
Col!

796
01:37:01.358 --> 01:37:03.664
Defend these stairs
with your fucking life!

797
01:37:03.689 --> 01:37:04.623
Hannah!

798
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:07.320
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!

799
01:38:19.599 --> 01:38:21.679
Sorry...

800
01:38:28.121 --> 01:38:30.212
- Sir...
- Shh.

801
01:38:33.863 --> 01:38:35.943
Shh.

802
01:38:59.219 --> 01:39:01.300
Hannah?

803
01:39:49.012 --> 01:39:51.093
Hannah?

804
01:39:51.183 --> 01:39:52.703
Selena?

805
01:40:03.836 --> 01:40:08.237
I haven't got any bullets. I
haven't got any fucking bullets!

806
01:40:12.668 --> 01:40:15.369
Don't fucking leave me!

807
01:41:00.461 --> 01:41:02.201
Come on!

808
01:41:04.202 --> 01:41:06.252
Move!

809
01:41:06.332 --> 01:41:08.943
Move! Move!

810
01:41:11.594 --> 01:41:13.431
It's just you and
me now, darlin'.

811
01:41:13.456 --> 01:41:16.049
But don't worry, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

812
01:41:16.115 --> 01:41:20.146
Then we'll find a nice little fucking
place somewhere. Just you and me.

813
01:41:20.436 --> 01:41:22.787
And we'll live happy
ever after, eh?

814
01:42:27.744 --> 01:42:30.224
That was longer
than a heartbeat.

815
01:42:33.055 --> 01:42:35.136
Jim?

816
01:42:44.488 --> 01:42:48.009
Listen. Listen. It's
not all fucked.

817
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.281
We're gonna be okay.
It's not all fucked.

818
01:42:56.411 --> 01:42:59.712
- I've got to explain something...
- Shut up.

819
01:43:00.492 --> 01:43:02.753
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay...

820
01:43:08.234 --> 01:43:11.805
Hannah, it's okay!
He's not infected.

821
01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:13.976
But I thought he was biting you.

822
01:43:14.066 --> 01:43:16.756
I was kissing her.
Are you stoned?

823
01:43:16.806 --> 01:43:18.977
It's a long story.

824
01:43:19.067 --> 01:43:21.198
We have to get out of here.
Come on!

825
01:43:23.978 --> 01:43:26.069
Come on! Move!

826
01:43:33.071 --> 01:43:35.241
You killed all my boys.

827
01:43:35.331 --> 01:43:36.982
Wait...

828
01:43:44.374 --> 01:43:45.894
Hannah!

829
01:43:45.984 --> 01:43:47.594
Hannah? Hannah!

830
01:43:49.295 --> 01:43:51.465
Hannah!

831
01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.210
Get in.

832
01:44:28.165 --> 01:44:29.996
They're locked.

833
01:44:30.086 --> 01:44:32.476
The gates are locked!

834
01:44:34.227 --> 01:44:36.267
Just fucking do it!

835
01:44:59.523 --> 01:45:01.914
Come on, Jim, breathe!
Fucking breathe!

836
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:24.970
Not the curtains as well.

837
01:46:35.638 --> 01:46:38.339
You looked all right
in this, you know.

838
01:46:39.509 --> 01:46:41.030
It's coming!

839
01:46:57.734 --> 01:46:59.865
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!

840
01:46:59.945 --> 01:47:03.296
- I can't hear anything!
- I told you, I heard it!

841
01:47:23.781 --> 01:47:25.611
Go.

842
01:47:58.790 --> 01:48:01.701
Do you think he
saw us this time?
