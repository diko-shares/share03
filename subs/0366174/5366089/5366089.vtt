00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:37.468
- You've sold us a bill of goods, Gordon.

19
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:40.596
You promised us new
drugs to fight everything

20
00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.098
from the common cold to cancer.

21
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:44.186
- And we'll deliver
everything that we promised.

22
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:47.186
- I'm sorry, Gordon, but
the adventure is over.

23
00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:50.856
We re exercising our option to liquidate

Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.

25
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:57.738
- Jack, show these people how filthy rich

26
00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:58.614
we're gonna make them, please.

27
00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:01.534
- Cordon, I don't think you
understand what I just said.

28
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:02.952
- Oh, I think I understand.

29
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080
Jack.

30
00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:14.338
- Perrinia immortalis, the Blood Orchid.

31
00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:17.007
First described in 1392 by Houghton,

32
00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.216
the last person to see it

33
00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:21.011
until our exploratory team
brought a Sample from Borneo.

34
00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:24.189
The Blood Orchid lies
dormant for seven years,

35
00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:25.725
then blooms for just six months.

36
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:28.352
- Which means we just got
lucky as hell, gentlemen.

37
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:30.146
- I don't suppose anyone here

38
00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:32.273
is familiar with the Hayflick limit?

39
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.625
- Hayflick proposed that a cell

40
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:34.942
could only replicate 56 times

41
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:37.486
before it died from a buildup of toxins.

42
00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.496
According to him, it's
the reason that we die.

43
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.699
- But what if we could
transcend that limit?

44
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.410
- That would be impossible.

45
00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:45.870
- Not according to our data.

46
00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:48.831
Our research indicates
the presence of a chemical

47
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.332
in Perrinia immortalis

48
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.753
that can significantly
prolong cellular life.

49
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.337
- [Gail] I can't support this.

50
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.382
- Does that mean what I think it moans?

51
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.553
- Are we talking about a
pharmaceutical equivalent

52
00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:04.180
to the fountain of youth?

53
00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.389
- Exactly.

54
00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:09.101
- That'd be bigger than Viagra.

55
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.997
- Have you put this into human trials?

56
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:13.814
- We can't yet.

57
00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.609
Our sample was degraded
in the initial Study.

58
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.986
We need more of the orchid.

59
00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:21.405
- See, and that's our
only problem, gentlemen.

60
00:05:21.614 --> 00:05:23.615
That orchid is only in
bloom tor another two weeks.

61
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.327
[dramatic music]

62
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.832
- Well, what the hell are you waiting for?

63
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.417
Oct your asses down to Borneo.

64
00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:38.463
- Yes.

65
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.163
- Welcome to Borneo.
- Thanks.

66
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.837
- What's wrong with this picture?

67
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:19.686
- I don't know, let me see, you're in it?

68
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.298
- We don't have a boat, okay?

69
00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:23.634
Your company had one
responsibility, to get a boat,

70
00:06:23.843 --> 00:06:25.445
and you've already managed to screw it up.

71
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.095
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.

72
00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.739
Your girl chartered the boat, not us.

73
00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:29.741
- No, no, Sam confirmed
with the company last night.

74
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:31.326
They're still waiting for your payment.

75
00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.561
- Hey, hey, I've got something.

76
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.229
Payment cleared.

77
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.437
- Really?

78
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:38.941
- Where's the boat?

79
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.609
- It's not coming.

80
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:42.945
All of the charter
companies have shut down.

81
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.990
No one'll risk going upriver
until after the rainy season.

82
00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:47.283
- And when's that?

83
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:48.534
- Two, three weeks.

84
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.496
- The orchid's only in bloom
for one more week, tops.

85
00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.999
- There's a local captain named Jin-Soon.

86
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:59.211
I'm told he'll take anyone
upriver for the right price.

87
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.548
[upbeat hip hop music]

88
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.189
- are you sure this is the place?

89
00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:21.609
- They said the one with the red door.

90
00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:22.443
- I bet you any kind of money

91
00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.421
there's somebody's playing
Russian roulette in there.

92
00:07:24.445 --> 00:07:26.766
- Well, maybe we'll get lucky
and they'll give you a turn.

93
00:07:26.822 --> 00:07:28.699
- Hey, why don't you two just get a room.

94
00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:29.908
Come on, Sam.

95
00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:46.050
Wait here.

96
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:47.259
- Yeah, if you insist.

97
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.511
- Hey, hey.

98
00:07:51.013 --> 00:07:52.013
Jin-Soon.

99
00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:05.193
Jin-Soon?

100
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:11.200
[speaking in foreign language]

101
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.589
- Your Indonesian sucks.

102
00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:27.299
Stick to English.

103
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:29.760
- We heard you could take us upriver.

104
00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:30.969
- In rainy season?

105
00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:33.888
Won't be cheap.

106
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.351
- We can pay you 25,000.

107
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.313
- I'll have a talk with the captain.

108
00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.208
- What do you mean,
you're not the captain?

109
00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:44.232
- Jin-Soon!

110
00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:48.775
These tourists need a boat.

111
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:50.489
I told them not in the rainy season.

112
00:08:52.992 --> 00:08:54.493
- You're Jin-Soon?

113
00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:56.203
- Local nickname.

114
00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:58.956
Name's Johnson, Bill Johnson.

115
00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:00.916
It's a pronunciation thing.

116
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.419
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.

117
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.337
Now, you want me to drive it,

118
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.340
well, that'll cost you 50.

119
00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:10.300
- 50 grand, are you high?

120
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:12.988
You know what, please
don't answer that question.

121
00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:15.292
There is no way I'm trusting
thiS guy with the expedition.

122
00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.974
- Listen, lady.

123
00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.393
Let's cut the bullshit, please.

124
00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.396
If one of the other charter
companies could take you,

125
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.939
you'd be on the river by now.

126
00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:27.526
You only came to me
because you're desperate.

127
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.696
50 grand's my price.

128
00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.323
Take it or leave it.

129
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:46.295
[dramatic music]

130
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.105
- I've seen subway cars
in better Shape than thiS.

131
00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:09.485
- Yeah, she may be ugly, but she puts out.

132
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.289
- Ah, shit!

133
00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:23.874
- What took you so long?

134
00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:26.710
- Hey, you try getting a GPS
locator, a Sat-Nav EchoStar

135
00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.880
and a UV spectrometer
past Indonesian customs.

136
00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:31.673
- Complaining already.
- Yeah.

137
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:33.523
- Would you rather be back in the office?

138
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.551
- Hell, yeah.

139
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.221
Girl, I had courtside seats
at the Garden Saturday night.

140
00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.473
I was gonna sit right
between Spike and Woody.

141
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.684
Oh, man, is that our ride?

142
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:44.537
- [chuckling] Look at
the bright side, Cole.

143
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.522
At least the weather's nice.

144
00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.651
- Ben Douglas, team doctor.

145
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:51.610
You must be Sam.

146
00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.487
- Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

147
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.780
Glad to have you aboard.

148
00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.326
- I'm gonna get you for this.

149
00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:02.704
- [Ben] Oh, yeah, this could be fun.

150
00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:04.665
- You can forget about that, dog.

151
00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.251
That's one car you
ain't never gonna catch.

152
00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.669
- There's always a way.

153
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.755
- Your team's a little green, huh?

154
00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:13.549
- My former grad students.

155
00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:14.757
Best in their field.

156
00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.886
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall:

157
00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:20.931
you want the best young
talent, recruit early.

158
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.144
- Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.

159
00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.066
- I think I resent that.

160
00:11:33.235 --> 00:11:36.113
- [Bill] You and the other
gal can stay in here.

161
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:37.321
- You live here.

162
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.160
- The way you say that, I
can tell you're impressed.

163
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.748
All right, and if you need anything.

164
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.253
Well, if you need anything,
you're shit out of luck.

165
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.763
[dramatic music]

166
00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:25.453
- Okay.

167
00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:31.126
Now, this is where the
exploratory team found the orchid.

168
00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:33.045
In the Selatan Basin.

169
00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.814
It took them three days to get upriver.

170
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.758
- Yeah, that was before the rainy season.

171
00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:39.927
Some of these waterways
could be dangerous now.

172
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.012
- You said you could got us there safely.

173
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:43.347
- And I will.

174
00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.641
But safe isn't always quick.

175
00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.393
We'll work our way upriver
one bend at a time.

176
00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:51.772
If I don't like what I
see, we change course.

177
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.274
You can't chart the fastest
route before you begin.

178
00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:55.483
- Already have.

179
00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:58.778
Check, aight.

180
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.283
Now, we're uplinked in real
time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.

181
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.661
Now, under ideal conditions,
[keyboard clicking]

182
00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.788
This is the fastest route.

183
00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.998
But once we superimpose weather patterns

184
00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:13.627
for the past 10 years
and then extrapolate,

185
00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.841
bingo, it's Padrang to the Selatan Basin.

186
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.050
I'm a bad man.

187
00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.447
- All right, look, we got less than a week

188
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.264
to get to that orchid.

189
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.933
Now, if you can't get the job done,

190
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:30.727
give us our money back and
we'll get somebody who can.

191
00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.521
- I'll get you there.

192
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:35.357
[dramatic music]

193
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.162
- Ugh.

194
00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:54.668
God help me.

195
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:02.758
Ugh.

196
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.151

[monkey chattering]

200
00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:55.645
Something attacked me,
something attacked me!

201
00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:56.480
Oh, my god!

202
00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.124
- Man, she said something attacked her.

203
00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:01.026
[monkey chattering]

204
00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.653
- No, no, no, no, no!

205
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.281
- It's okay, it's okay.

206
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.116
What the hell did you do?

207
00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:09.325
You scared him.

208
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.409
- I scared him?

209
00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.789
- This is Kong.

210
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.124
Kong lives here.

211
00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.460
You're guests.

212
00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:22.463
Be nice.

213
00:15:23.507 --> 00:15:24.633
- Disgusting animal.

214
00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:28.762
- Uh, you okay now?

215
00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:34.017
- I'm fine, just keep
your hands off of me.

216
00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.395
- Oh, yeah, well, it's gonna
be tough, but I'll try.

217
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:40.148
[bright instrumental music]

218
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.511
No, no, the S-1 has to be on
file before the week is out.

219
00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:53.203
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, I don't care.

220
00:15:53.412 --> 00:15:55.247
See, that's the point.
- Yeah, yeah, hello?

221
00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.125
- No, the S-1 needs to be on
file before the week is out.

222
00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.126
- Yes, we were able to get on the river...

223
00:15:59.334 --> 00:15:59.960
- Well, that's the whole purpose.

224
00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:01.962
We need the comments back from the SEC.

225
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.481
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

226
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.524
I'm trying...
- lt's the only place

227
00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:06.425
I got reception.
- No, juSt get it done, okay?

228
00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.069
- No, that's impossible.
- We need to be ready to go,

229
00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:08.718
effectively...
- Three, four days...

230
00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:09.928
Hello?

232
00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:12.764
- Damn!
- Damn it!

233
00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:14.307
- Try my phone.

234
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.435
Works just as good, but it's free.

235
00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:20.439
- Oh, okay, okay, maybe you
can use my Special antenna

236
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.232
to boost your reception.

237
00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:23.441
[Tran laughing]

238
00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:25.211
- [Jack] We're dealing
with a lithophytic vine,

239
00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.362
so we want to search any rock face.

240
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:30.073
- Now, this ridge here seems a good bot.

241
00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:31.074
- Sam.

242
00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:34.161
[camera shutter clicks]

243
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.329
Come on, Sam, what do you say?

244
00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:40.333
We're young, we're
Single, we're in Borneo.

245
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.835
What do you got to lose?

246
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:44.379
You're not satisfied, you
walk away, no commitments.

247
00:16:44.588 --> 00:16:46.465
- No commitments?

248
00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.008
That's your pitch?

249
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.135
- Did I say no commitments?

250
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.136
I meant marry me.

251
00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.181
- Am I gonna be dealing with
thiS for the next two weeks?

252
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.389
- Yep.

253
00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:01.605
[dramatic music]

254
00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:13.909
- So you were one of Jack's students?

255
00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:17.913
- Yeah, he was teaching a seminar
on botanical pharmacology.

256
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.499
Soon as I finished my
dissertation, he hired me.

257
00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.542
- Well, that's one way to get a leg up.

258
00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.588
- What's that supposed to mean?

259
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:27.982
- I had a professor who wanted to hire me

260
00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:28.673
right out of school.

261
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.967
Of course, he wanted
me to be his secretary.

262
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.502
- Look, it I've done something
to offend you in any way...

263
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.849
- No, no, dear, not at all.

264
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.226
Actually, I admire you.

265
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.102
Took me 10 years to get where I am.

266
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.147
Clearly, your generation
has it figured out.

267
00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.509
- Man, this is good, man.

268
00:17:54.533 --> 00:17:56.117
Where'd you learn to cook like this?

269
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.537
- It's just a little recipe
I picked up in Sri Lanka.

270
00:17:58.745 --> 00:17:59.871
- What were you doing there?

271
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.248
- Doctors Without Borders.

272
00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.708
It's my day job.

273
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.895
- You guys expect to need
a doctor for Some reason?

274
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.255
- Can't get the expedition
bonded without one.

275
00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.174
- Well, you just think of me
as a charming insurance policy.

285
00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.592

I'm not sleeping up there.

286
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.951
I ain't sleeping on the floor.

It's the jungle.

- We need those results by next month

309
00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.552
if we want the FDA off our backs.

[Gail gasping]

333
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:54.773
- Maybe you should drop the phone.

334
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:56.041
It's probably holding you back.

336
00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.557

00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:10.557
- Where'd he go?
- Bill, Bill!

359
00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.183
- I don't see him.

360
00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:14.602
Where's he gone?
- Oh, my god.

361
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:19.691
[all gasping]
[Bill coughing]

362
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:26.822
- Oh, shit, you won.

363
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.786
[Bill coughing]

364
00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:34.455
[Bill panting]

365
00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:40.545
- You're okay?

366
00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:41.921
- I lost my phone.

367
00:23:43.047 --> 00:23:44.299
- Sorry to hoar it.

368
00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:52.223
- That was either the bravest

369
00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:54.183
or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

370
00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:57.477
- It's a fine line.

371
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:19.042
- Good as new.
- Thanks.

372
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:26.132
- To Gail, who knows it's
better to cat than be eaten.

373
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:28.176
- To Gail.
- Hear, hear, baby.

374
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.930
- Almost eaten just to find a flower.

375
00:24:33.056 --> 00:24:35.767
Hardly seems worth it.
- Oh, it's worth it.

376
00:24:35.975 --> 00:24:37.352
I mean, think about it, right?

377
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.355
A pill that you take every
day for the rest of your lite.

378
00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:43.900
Now, even if we charge,
say, a dollar a pop,

379
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:46.902
we're billionaires.

380
00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:49.364
- [Cole] Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

381
00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:50.907
- At $100 a bottle,

382
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:52.968
I'll dive in that river
and fight that croc myself.

383
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:55.453
[all laughing]

384
00:24:56.454 --> 00:24:59.791
- So how many flowers does
it take to save the world?

385
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:00.999
- We figure 50 orchids

386
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:02.752
will yield about an ounce of chemical.

387
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.338
- You could have a football
field full of those orchids,

388
00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:08.675
still doesn't mean you can
get it through human trials.

389
00:25:08.883 --> 00:25:09.883
[Tran exhales]

390
00:25:09.926 --> 00:25:11.761
- She doesn't even believe in you.

391
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.471
- Comes with the territory.

392
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.307
In research, you've got
to go out on a limb.

393
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.327
And there's always someone
waiting to chop it off.

394
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.146
[Kong screeching]
[Gail Screaming]

395
00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:23.582
- Where the hell have you been, huh?

396
00:25:23.606 --> 00:25:24.273
[Kong screeching]

397
00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:25.191
- Damn that thing!

398
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.442
- Where you been, boy?

399
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:27.651
Calm down, calm down.

400
00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:30.088
- Poor guy.
- Lt's okay, it's all right.

401
00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:31.739
- Looks like ho's seen a ghost.

402
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:34.093
- It's all right.
[Kong screeching]

403
00:25:34.117 --> 00:25:35.410
It's all right.

404
00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:36.744
It's all right.

405
00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:44.210
- What if Gail's right?

406
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:47.380
I mean, colls in a Petri
dish are one thing.

407
00:25:48.631 --> 00:25:49.674
Human trials are another.

408
00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:50.882
- She's wrong.

409
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:53.278
And when Perrinia
immortalis goes <i>to</i> product,

410
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:55.471
and you and I can cash
in our Stock options,

411
00:25:57.223 --> 00:25:58.725
we'll rub her face in it.

412
00:25:58.933 --> 00:25:59.933
- Stock options?

413
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:02.729
- I spoke to Mitchell.

414
00:26:02.937 --> 00:26:04.564
We're each giving you half a point.

415
00:26:06.357 --> 00:26:07.692
- I don't know what to say.

416
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.277
- Don't say anything.

417
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:10.485
You deserve it.

418
00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:16.534
All this wouldn't be
possible without your work.

419
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:22.914
- Jack.

420
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.626
I thought we decided against that.

421
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:29.547
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

422
00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:32.467
It would be fun, though.

423
00:26:33.593 --> 00:26:35.153
I mean, here we are, travelling upriver

424
00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:38.097
to the greatest discovery
of our careers, and,

425
00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:43.186
now, if this orchid thing
works out, then, who knows?

426
00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:44.479
- Is that why I'm here?

427
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.023
So you can give us one more try?

428
00:26:48.316 --> 00:26:51.736
- You're here because you're
the best researcher I've got.

429
00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:53.424
- [Bill] Am I interrupting something?

430
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.950
- No, no, I was, um,

431
00:26:58.159 --> 00:26:59.786
I was just going to bed.
- Yeah.

432
00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:02.163
Well, before you do that, we need to talk.

433
00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:11.089
[thunder rumbling]

434
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:15.675
We got a problem.

435
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.179
See the water level?
- Uh-huh.

436
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:20.932
- In high water, the
Mendranang gets rough.

437
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.159
Now, what we could do is turn around

438
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:23.643
and try to find another course.

439
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:25.728
But that would take at least two days.

440
00:27:25.937 --> 00:27:27.063
- We don't have the time.

441
00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:29.524
- If the river becomes impassable,

442
00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:31.526
it's gonna take a lot longer.

443
00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:34.737
- And if we turn back, then
we're definitely screwed.

444
00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:36.239
We're gonna have to risk it.

445
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.325
- What if I don't wanna risk it?

446
00:27:41.244 --> 00:27:43.496
- Do you have any idea
what this flower means?

447
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.289
We're talking about

448
00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:47.208
the biggest medical discovery in history.

449
00:27:48.876 --> 00:27:51.754
- Wow, that does sound great, Jack.

450
00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:55.550
But I was never any good at history.

451
00:27:55.758 --> 00:27:57.802
You want me to risk the Mendranang,

452
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.138
it's gonna cost you an extra 50,000.

453
00:28:00.346 --> 00:28:03.224
[suspenseful music]

454
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.060
- Done.

455
00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:08.937
- Done?

456
00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:12.316
Don't you gotta ask the
boss lady or Something?

457
00:28:12.525 --> 00:28:13.525
- I'll pay it myself.

458
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:19.532
- All right, you got yourself a deal.

459
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:21.617
But if we hit trouble,

460
00:28:21.826 --> 00:28:23.703
your people do what I say, you got that?

461
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.622
- You're the captain.

462
00:28:42.513 --> 00:28:43.556
- Research proposals?

463
00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:48.186
- Yeah, research proposals.

464
00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:52.023
You're not the only
company we're in bed with.

465
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.192
- Yeah, but we're the
prettiest and most popular.

466
00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:56.360
It's like sleeping with
the head cheerleader.

467
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.988
- Not quite.

468
00:28:59.197 --> 00:29:00.740
- Come on, you know you love us.

469
00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:01.948
- I love your cash.

470
00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.824
- Then why don't you let
me get a look at that file.

471
00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:06.591
I mean, after this orchid thing goes bust,

472
00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:08.456
you're gonna be finished at Wexell-Hall

473
00:29:09.415 --> 00:29:11.876
unless you got something else lined up.

474
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:14.003
- You really wanna see us fail, don't you?

475
00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:18.216
- No, I just think that you will.

476
00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:20.301
I am a scientist, you know.

477
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:21.509
- Scientist?

478
00:29:22.762 --> 00:29:24.555
What are you doing at Wexell-Hall?

479
00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:25.764
- I like science.

480
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:28.726
I just like money better.

481
00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:32.480
- I'll drink to that.

482
00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:35.316

[logs thumping]

487
00:30:15.815 --> 00:30:17.316
- River's flooded.

488
00:30:17.525 --> 00:30:18.901
We can't see the banks.

489
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.110
- Miss our turnoff?

490
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:22.571
- [Tran] It's just ahead.

00:30:31.205 --> 00:30:32.832
- Rudder's jammed.
- What?

495
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040
Watch out.

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.714
Shit!
[dramatic music]

498
00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:42.174
Oct up.

499
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:43.592
Everybody up.

500
00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:44.801

[Bill grunts]

502
00:30:54.312 --> 00:30:55.392
- [Gordon] What's going on?

503
00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:57.023
- [Bill] goddammit.

[engine whining]
[engine hissing]

505
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:00.526
Oh, shit, we've blown the head gasket.

506
00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:02.194
- We all right?

507
00:31:02.403 --> 00:31:05.114
- Hey, what's going on?
[engine hissing]

508
00:31:05.323 --> 00:31:07.325
- What is it?
- We got problems.

509
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:09.452
- Hey, what's wrong, man?
- Bill, wait.

510
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.828
What are you talking about?

511
00:31:11.037 --> 00:31:13.331
- We're shot.
- What problems?

[engine revving]

513
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.008

the current's too strong.

[engine revving]

516
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.609

- I know.

517
00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:42.860
Come on, baby.

518
00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:47.865
- [Ben] Come on, man.

519
00:31:48.074 --> 00:31:48.699
- [Gordon] What is it?

520
00:31:48.908 --> 00:31:50.451
- [Colo] What is it?

521
00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:57.124
- [Gordon] What do you see?

522
00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:58.333
- Come on.

523
00:31:59.168 --> 00:31:59.877
You got this.

524
00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:01.128
Come on, girl.

00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:14.308

527
00:32:14.517 --> 00:32:15.726

00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:18.312
[Sam gasping]

529
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.271
Come on!

Oh, shit!

531
00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:27.278
- Holy shit.

- [Ben] Where's Cole?

537
00:33:26.255 --> 00:33:27.465
- Swim to the rocks, this way.

538
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.093
- [Ben] Keep going.

539
00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:35.306
[coughing]
[gasping]

540
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.558
Come on, get to the rocks.

541
00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:39.894
Where's Cole?

542
00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:40.728
Cole!
- Where's Cole?

543
00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:41.520
- [Jack] Over there!

544
00:33:41.729 --> 00:33:43.522
Over there, over there!

545
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:45.816
[Sam coughing]

546
00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:46.692
- [Colo] Come on, man.

547
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:48.277
Give me your hand!

548
00:33:51.697 --> 00:33:52.990
- [Ben] Come on.

549
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:56.158
You got it, Sam, come on.

550
00:33:56.202 --> 00:33:58.120
- [Jack] Come on, Sam, give me your hand.

551
00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:00.748
I've got you, I've got you, whoa.

552
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:03.918
Give me your hand, give me your hand.

553
00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:07.546
- [Bill] Okay, I got her.

554
00:34:07.755 --> 00:34:09.006
- You almost got us killed!

555
00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:10.382
- You think I wanted this?

556
00:34:10.591 --> 00:34:11.675
I just lost my damn boat!

557
00:34:11.884 --> 00:34:12.593
- You're gonna lose your damn payday

558
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:13.511
if you don't got us out of this.

559
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.988
- You said you could got us there safely.

560
00:34:15.012 --> 00:34:16.372
If you knew it was that dangerous,

561
00:34:16.472 --> 00:34:17.139
you should've turned around.

562
00:34:17.348 --> 00:34:18.516
- That's enough!

563
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.604
There's nothing we can do about that now.

564
00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:24.813
It's a waste of energy.

565
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.359
What have we got?

566
00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:34.573
- Some Specimen jars, a map,
a little water, no food.

567
00:34:37.451 --> 00:34:38.744
- [Ben] Hard drive's ruined.

568
00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:42.957
- Well, pretty much all
the equipment's Shot.

569
00:34:43.165 --> 00:34:44.875
[phone beeps]

570
00:34:45.084 --> 00:34:46.724
Except one of the sat phones still works.

571
00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:47.419
It's online.

572
00:34:47.628 --> 00:34:50.130
- Thank god, we can call the police.

573
00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:51.382
- Police.

574
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.426
the nearest river patrol
is back in Padrang.

575
00:34:54.635 --> 00:34:56.720
The only way to get to us is over that.

576
00:34:57.888 --> 00:34:59.473
- are you saying wc're stuck here?

577
00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:04.936
- Maybe not.

578
00:35:06.105 --> 00:35:06.814
We're here.

579
00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.983
The valley's completely flooded.

580
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:12.570
But I got a friend who operates
a boat on the Tokut River.

581
00:35:12.778 --> 00:35:16.782
I can give him a call, and ho
can meet us here at Naga Rock.

582
00:35:16.991 --> 00:35:19.368
- How far is that?

583
00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:20.828
- I don't know.

584
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:22.454
A two-day hike down the river.

585
00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:26.208
But if we bushwhack, we cut
at least a day off the trek.

586
00:35:26.417 --> 00:35:28.057
- Oh, my god, you wanna go through that?

587
00:35:28.168 --> 00:35:29.253
- It's the shortest way.

588
00:35:30.129 --> 00:35:32.339
We could be safely in
the Tokut by nightfall.

589
00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:37.261
- So we can continue with the expedition.

590
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:39.763
- Yeah, I'll got you to the flower.

591
00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:42.391
- I don't care about that
flower, just get us to Safety.

592
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.642
- It's the same thing.

593
00:35:44.602 --> 00:35:46.642
Now, we can either be on
my buddy's boat in 10 hours

594
00:35:46.812 --> 00:35:49.940
or we can sit here and wait
for the river patrol for days.

595
00:35:52.359 --> 00:35:54.320
- Your friend, is he reliable?

596
00:35:55.613 --> 00:35:56.613
- Absolutely.

597
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:00.784
You'd better not screw me on this.

598
00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:02.745
- Sounds like you're
already screwed, mate.

599
00:36:02.953 --> 00:36:03.953
- Pay you two grand.

600
00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:06.707
I need you on this one, John.

601
00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:08.542
- Yes, yes, so it seems.

602
00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.379
Look, Billy, I'd love to help you out,

603
00:36:12.588 --> 00:36:15.049
but I'm flat out, mate, you know.

604
00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:19.178
Probably squeeze you in
for, Say, five grand?

605
00:36:21.555 --> 00:36:22.555
- You're killing me.

606
00:36:23.474 --> 00:36:24.558
- That's mates' rates.

607
00:36:25.893 --> 00:36:26.995
Or you could always hike back to Padrang,

608
00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:29.188
if you wanna save bucks.

609
00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:30.648
Up to you, pal.

610
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:33.233
- Fine, five.
- Yeah!

611
00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:34.943
- But you'd better be there.

612
00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:35.903
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife

613
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:37.946
about that little side trip to Bangkok.

614
00:36:38.155 --> 00:36:40.908
[phones beeping]

615
00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:42.409
- Wife's long gone, Billy.

616
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:44.912
Long gone, mate.

617
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.750
- All right, people, we're on.

618
00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.168
Saddle up.

619
00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:52.377
Stay together.

620
00:36:52.503 --> 00:36:54.630
This jungle is all green all the time,

621
00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.590
and you will got lost.

622
00:36:56.799 --> 00:36:59.426
[dramatic music]

623
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:21.865
- It's like doing a
StairMaster in a sauna.

624
00:37:22.074 --> 00:37:23.909
- Yeah, I might die of a heat stroke,

625
00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:26.286
but I'll have a nice tight ass.

626
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:28.997
- That's the spirit, Cole.

627
00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:34.044
- [Ben] You want me to grab that?

628
00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:35.462
- Is that a trick question?

629
00:37:36.714 --> 00:37:37.714
Here, man.

630
00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:42.845
- Right between Spike and Woody.

631
00:37:43.053 --> 00:37:44.254
Right between Spike and Woody.

- I'm fine.

635
00:37:56.859 --> 00:38:00.696
- See, a crisis separates the
real men from the pretenders.

636
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:02.698
- Yeah, can see that.

637
00:38:06.076 --> 00:38:07.870
- What, that?
[Sam chuckles]

638
00:38:08.078 --> 00:38:09.078
That's nothing.

[Cole panting]

640
00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:17.296

- Knock yourself out.

644
00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:40.359
- Hey.

645
00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:43.822
I'm sorry about your boat.

646
00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:47.159
- Yeah, well.

647
00:38:48.577 --> 00:38:51.038
It was a piece of shit anyway.

[suspenseful music]

649
00:39:17.272 --> 00:39:18.524
- Can we go around?

650
00:39:20.442 --> 00:39:23.362
- Yeah, we could, but
we'd lose another day.

651
00:39:27.908 --> 00:39:29.284
let's go.

- What was what?

663
00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:40.290
- Something just moved.
- Oh, please, don't say that.

664

just moved past me.

as in something's alive?

00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:56.324
Calm down, okay?

716
00:42:56.533 --> 00:42:57.993
Okay?
- Okay, Jack, I'm okay.

717
00:42:58.201 --> 00:42:59.201
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

718
00:42:59.244 --> 00:43:00.495
- Okay.
- I'll juSt.

719
00:43:00.704 --> 00:43:03.457
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna sit right here.

720
00:43:03.665 --> 00:43:04.665
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:07.586 --> 00:43:10.172
- Listen, anacondas are territorial.

722
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.257
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.

723
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:14.968
There won't be another one for miles.

724
00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:18.055
We gotta got to the boat.

725
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:19.263
It's not that far.

726
00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:24.978
So if we keep moving and stick
together, we should be fine.

727
00:43:25.187 --> 00:43:26.187
- We should be?

728
00:43:28.774 --> 00:43:30.150
- How big do they get?

729
00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:32.486
- That was the biggest
one I've ever Seen by far.

730
00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:34.071
A freak of nature.

731
00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:35.840
The odds of running into
another one that size

732
00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:36.948
are astronomical.

733
00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:38.366
- Yeah, but how do we know

734
00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:41.119
that the one that got Ben
is not gonna come after us?

735
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.164
- It takes them weeks to digest.

736
00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:48.543
Meal like that, he'll be
Sleeping it off for a while.

737
00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:51.213
[somber music]

738
00:43:55.342 --> 00:43:59.429
- Let's just get to
that boat and get home.

739
00:43:59.638 --> 00:44:00.639
- What about the orchid?

740
00:44:02.474 --> 00:44:03.892
- You've gotta be kidding me.

741
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:05.941
- It won't be in bloom
for another seven years.

742
00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:08.146
- This expedition is over, Jack.

743
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:09.731
- Now, hold on a second, Gail.

744
00:44:10.649 --> 00:44:12.085
There's a lot of money
at stake here, okay?

745
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.818
- I don't care!

746
00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:14.026
Ben is dead!

747
00:44:14.111 --> 00:44:16.238
We have lost someone.

748
00:44:16.446 --> 00:44:17.726
As Wexell-Hall's representative,

749
00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:19.658
I am calling this expedition off.

750
00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:20.534
- You don't have the authority.

751
00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:22.386
- Check your contract.
- In case you hadn't noticed,

752
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.995
we're in the middle of the jungle.

753
00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:26.623
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

754
00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:33.379
- Jack, I'm with her.

755
00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:35.298
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.

756
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:41.888
- Look, Ben was my friend, okay?

757
00:44:42.097 --> 00:44:42.806
I got him into this,

758
00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.016
and no one fees worse about it than I do.

759
00:44:46.268 --> 00:44:47.370
I don't wanna do anything stupid.

760
00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:49.771
I just wanna accomplish
what we came here tor.

761
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.275
If we turn back now, Ben's
death would be for nothing.

762
00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.700
- Let's just get back to the boat.

763
00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:04.661
We can regroup and make our decision then.

764
00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:08.914
- Fine.

765
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:20.677
- Jack, maybe Gail's right.

766
00:45:20.886 --> 00:45:22.345
- She's just scared.

767
00:45:22.554 --> 00:45:24.514
Once we got back to the
boat, she'll be okay.

768
00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:33.440
- When we get back to the
boat, thiS expedition is over.

769
00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:35.543
the only place I'm taking
these people is to Safety.

770
00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:37.611
- Hey, hey, hey, we had a deal.

771
00:45:37.819 --> 00:45:39.821
- Keep your money, doc.

772
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.114
Someone is dead.

773
00:45:41.323 --> 00:45:43.325
We're officially in over our heads.

774
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:45.094
- You just said we wouldn't
run into another one

775
00:45:45.118 --> 00:45:45.827
of those things.

776
00:45:46.036 --> 00:45:48.997
- And we probably won't,
but I can't guarantee it.

777
00:45:49.206 --> 00:45:53.293
So I'll get you to the boat,
and after that, we're done.

778
00:45:56.922 --> 00:46:00.342
- Well, that answers it.
- That answers nothing.

779
00:46:01.301 --> 00:46:02.622
I'll just throw more money at him

780
00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:03.303
when we get back to the boat.

781
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.573
If he doesn't take it, I'll
offer his friend the same deal.

782
00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:06.657
- Jack, maybe we should listen...

783
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:09.434
- Sam, if we don't get to that orchid now,

784
00:46:09.643 --> 00:46:11.686
all of our work will
have been for nothing.

785
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.522
I need your support, okay?

786
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:16.566
You have as much riding on this as I do.

787
00:46:16.775 --> 00:46:18.193
Don't let me down.

788
00:46:24.616 --> 00:46:26.377
- [Cole] I saw this
special on Animal planet.

789
00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:27.869
Anacondas are vicious, man.

790
00:46:28.078 --> 00:46:29.287
I mean, they hunt for sport.

791
00:46:29.496 --> 00:46:30.723
They don't even need
to See you to cat you.

792
00:46:30.747 --> 00:46:32.099
I mean, they just use
their flicking tongues

793
00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.601
to sense your body heat...
- Will you shut the hell up?

794
00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:35.460
- And I knew this guy
who knew thiS other guy

795
00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:36.949
who used to shoot documentaries,

796
00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:38.564
and he won't down to the
Amazon with thiS crew once,

797
00:46:38.588 --> 00:46:39.965
and they were all eaten by snakes.

798
00:46:40.173 --> 00:46:40.799
That's a true story.

799
00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:42.276
- Come on, you knew a guy who knew a guy,

800
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300
that's an urban myth.

801
00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:47.264
[suspenseful music]

802
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:53.603
[Bill sighing]

803
00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:55.522
- I'm sorry about Ben.

804
00:46:58.358 --> 00:47:00.610
I never should've stayed
on the Mendranang.

805
00:47:01.778 --> 00:47:03.405
- What do you mean?

806
00:47:03.613 --> 00:47:04.674
- Well, I figured he
didn't tell the others,

807
00:47:04.698 --> 00:47:07.284
but I thought you know.

808
00:47:07.492 --> 00:47:08.492
- Knew what?

809
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.332
- Byron offered me an extra
50 grand to stay on the river.

810
00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:17.377
I told him it might get rough,
but he wanted to risk it.

811
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.547
Hey, don't blame him.

812
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:22.590
It was my call.

813
00:47:24.301 --> 00:47:25.301
I took the money.

814
00:47:26.428 --> 00:47:28.346
I thought I could get us through.

815
00:47:28.555 --> 00:47:29.973
You wanna blame anyone?

816
00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:31.181
You blame me.

817
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.395
[Kong chattering]

818
00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:39.482
- These boots are killing me.

819
00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:47.699
Colo.

820
00:47:47.907 --> 00:47:48.992
- What?

821
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.327
- You got some.

822
00:47:53.872 --> 00:47:54.581
[Cole screaming]

823
00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:56.207
- [Colo] Oh, god, what is that?

824
00:47:56.416 --> 00:47:57.816
Oct it off, get it off, got it off!

825
00:47:57.876 --> 00:47:59.669
Oh, my god, take it off!
- All right, relax.

826
00:47:59.878 --> 00:48:00.896
- Help me, help me!
- All right, hold on, hold on.

827
00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.546
- [Colo] Help me, help me!

828
00:48:01.755 --> 00:48:02.380
Get it off, get it off!
- Hold on, hey.

829
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:03.965
[Cole Shouting]
Okay, calm down.

830
00:48:04.174 --> 00:48:05.174
Calm down.

831
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:05.884
Colo!

832
00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:07.802
Cole, calm down.

833
00:48:08.011 --> 00:48:09.888
- What is it, what is it?

834
00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:10.722
Oct it off, Bill.

835
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:11.556
Oct it off, get it off,

836
00:48:11.765 --> 00:48:12.390
get it off of me.
- All right, all right, look.

837
00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:13.350
Just a lighter.
- Oh hell, no,

838
00:48:13.558 --> 00:48:14.184
you ain't burning me.
- JuSt a lighter.

839
00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:16.144
Just a lighter.
- Okay.

840
00:48:16.353 --> 00:48:19.314
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[lighter clicking]

841
00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.150
- Shh, Shh.
- You burn me, I'll kill you.

842
00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:24.903
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

843
00:48:25.111 --> 00:48:27.113
[leech sizzling]
[Gail gasping]

[Bill grunts]
[Cole Screams]

845
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.699
- You all right, you okay?

846
00:48:29.908 --> 00:48:30.992
- [Colo] Yeah, I'm fine.

847
00:48:31.951 --> 00:48:33.078
- Oh.
- Huh, what?

848
00:48:33.286 --> 00:48:33.912
- Hold on.

849
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.290
Put your arms up.
- What are you doing?

850
00:48:37.499 --> 00:48:39.292
Why are you going under my shirt?

851
00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:41.002
[Gail gasps]

852
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:42.379
What you doing?
- Jesus.

853
00:48:42.587 --> 00:48:43.671
- Jesus what?

854
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.673
What, what, what is it?

855
00:48:47.384 --> 00:48:48.593
What is it, what is it?

856
00:48:48.802 --> 00:48:49.969
- Anybody got a blowtorch?

857
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.898
[Cole groaning]

858
00:49:03.274 --> 00:49:04.274
- Stop.

859
00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:09.154
Careful.

860
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:14.619
- [Gordon] Whoa, whoa!

861
00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:16.955
[Gail gasping]

862
00:49:17.163 --> 00:49:18.540
- If that thing bit you,

863
00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:20.468
you would be [speaking
in foreign language].

864
00:49:20.542 --> 00:49:22.669
Paralyzed like stone for two days.

865
00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:35.932
- [Jack] What do you call this fella?

866
00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:38.560
- Laba laba batu, stone spider.

867
00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:41.838
- I may have just discovered a
valuable new anesthetic agent

868
00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:42.522
for Wexell-Hall.

869
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.149
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

870
00:49:44.357 --> 00:49:46.609
Forget Wexell, we can get
thiS to the highest bidder.

871
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:50.405
- All right, show and tell's over.

872
00:49:50.613 --> 00:49:51.239
We gotta got to that boat.

873
00:49:51.448 --> 00:49:53.825
Put your boots on and let's go.

874
00:49:59.706 --> 00:50:02.667

[boat thumps]

876
00:50:06.963 --> 00:50:07.963
- Bugger it.

877
00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:15.722
What the hell was that?

878
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:18.766
[suspenseful music]

879
00:50:36.493 --> 00:50:37.869
Holy bloody hell.

[explosion rumbling]

884
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:07.524
- [Colo] Whoa, what was that?

885
00:51:08.983 --> 00:51:10.318
- [Bill] Oh, my god.

886
00:51:10.527 --> 00:51:13.071
- What the hell was that?

887
00:51:13.279 --> 00:51:14.572
- [Bill] Come on.

888
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:21.246
- No, no, no, no!

889
00:51:21.454 --> 00:51:22.705
Oh, come on, man!

890
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.000
- What the hell happened?

891
00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:27.209
- Livingston!

892
00:51:30.505 --> 00:51:31.548
- Here we go.

893
00:51:33.967 --> 00:51:35.569
Ho got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!

894
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:38.221
[glass shatters]

895
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.725
- Your friend, your friend!

896
00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:44.227
Now, what we gonna do now?

897
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:47.437
Shit!

898
00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.024
- Search the wreckage.

899
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:53.278
Find anything we can use.

900
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.031
And hope to god there's a phone.

901
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.867
[dramatic music]

902
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:18.219
- [Sam] Oh, come on, come on.

903
00:52:18.428 --> 00:52:19.428
Yes.

904
00:52:21.306 --> 00:52:24.100
[Kong chattering]

905
00:52:29.272 --> 00:52:30.272
- [Colo] Hello?

906
00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:31.566
[static crackling]

907
00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:32.984
Hello?

908
00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:35.194
Oh, come on.
- Anything?

909
00:52:35.403 --> 00:52:36.863
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

910
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:38.615
- What do you think I'm doing, Jack?

911
00:52:38.823 --> 00:52:40.033
[Kong screeching]

912
00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:41.534
Hello?

913
00:52:41.743 --> 00:52:42.743
Shit.

914
00:52:46.623 --> 00:52:47.623
Hello?

915
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:49.666
Come on, man, hello?

916
00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.423
- [Jack] All right, keep looking!

917
00:52:55.632 --> 00:53:00.511
[gentle instrumental music]
[birds Squawking]

918
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:14.232
- No phone?

919
00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:15.693
- Nothing.

920
00:53:15.902 --> 00:53:17.383
- Couldn't get a signal on the radio.

921
00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.200
- Now what?

922
00:53:22.408 --> 00:53:25.953
[gentle instrumental music]

923
00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:31.334
[flies buzzing]

924
00:53:36.381 --> 00:53:37.381
- What's going on?

925
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.302
- [Bill] Where'd these come from?

926
00:53:41.511 --> 00:53:43.179
- Lopaks.
- Who?

927
00:53:43.388 --> 00:53:46.224
- Local tribe, descended from headhunters.

928
00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:47.225
- What?

929
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:49.310
- Been in this region
for thousands of years.

930
00:53:49.519 --> 00:53:50.519
- Headhunters?

931
00:53:50.687 --> 00:53:52.397
- There's still some villages around here.

932
00:53:52.605 --> 00:53:54.124
- Yeah, it's supposed to be
one of their fishing Spots.

933
00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:55.148
- No, hold on, excuse me.

934
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:56.442
Did you say headhunters?

935
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.839
- There haven't been practicing
headhunters in Borneo

936
00:54:00.863 --> 00:54:01.572
for over a century.

937
00:54:01.781 --> 00:54:03.217
- Yeah, well, just because
they ain't practicing

938
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.867
don't moan they don't remember how.

939
00:54:06.577 --> 00:54:08.538
- They must be along
thiS branch of the river.

940
00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:13.334
If we can find their village,
maybe they can lend us a boat.

941
00:54:15.044 --> 00:54:15.795
- So wait a minute,

942
00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:18.548
we just gonna walk towards
the headhunters, not away?

943
00:54:20.258 --> 00:54:21.384
- [Bill] Yeah.

944
00:54:22.802 --> 00:54:24.178
- Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

945
00:54:24.387 --> 00:54:29.267
[suspenseful music]
[birds squawking]

946
00:54:39.444 --> 00:54:42.405
[Kong chattering]

947
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.282
Oh, god, I'm so hungry.

948
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:47.243
I'd sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.

949
00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:50.413
- You mention food one more time,

950
00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:54.167
I'm voting you off this island.

951
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:05.762
[dramatic music]
[all gasping]

952
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:06.970
- [Colo] Oh, god.

953
00:55:07.096 --> 00:55:08.096
[Gail screaming]

954
00:55:08.264 --> 00:55:09.264
- Is that?

955
00:55:10.475 --> 00:55:11.601
- Livingston.

956
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:12.809
- Oh, my god, man.

957
00:55:12.894 --> 00:55:14.604
What the hell happened to him?

958
00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:15.812
- Anaconda.

959
00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:21.235
- If he was eaten by the snake,

960
00:55:21.444 --> 00:55:24.822
then why is his body...
- Listen, listen, listen!

961
00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:27.825
All right.

962
00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:31.496
These things are at their
weakest when they digest.

963
00:55:31.704 --> 00:55:32.747
But if threatened,

964
00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:35.708
they will spit up their
food and attack again.

965
00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:36.542
- What?

966
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:37.853
Are you telling me there's
some Snake out there

967
00:55:37.877 --> 00:55:39.003
with an empty stomach?

968
00:55:39.212 --> 00:55:39.921
- Yeah.

969
00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:41.464
- The same one that got Ben?

970
00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:42.840
- No, no.

971
00:55:43.049 --> 00:55:45.551
There's no way that snake
could've gotten to Livingston.

972
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.761
It had to be another one.

973
00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:47.595
- Another one?

974
00:55:47.804 --> 00:55:49.031
You said that there wouldn't
be another one tor miles.

975
00:55:49.055 --> 00:55:50.055
- It wouldn't.

976
00:55:52.391 --> 00:55:54.018
Unless.
- Unless what?

977
00:55:55.812 --> 00:55:57.230
- Unless it's mating season.

978
00:55:57.438 --> 00:55:59.232
- Oh, my god.
- Mating season?

979
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.440
- Yeah.

980
00:56:01.567 --> 00:56:02.961
You see, the males are territorial,

981
00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:05.947
but when they smell a female in heat,

982
00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:09.158
they come running from everywhere.

983
00:56:09.367 --> 00:56:11.536
- Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit,

984
00:56:11.744 --> 00:56:15.915
and they all go after her at
once in one big mating ball.

985
00:56:16.833 --> 00:56:18.310
- So you're telling me
there's some snake orgy

986
00:56:18.334 --> 00:56:20.795
out in the jungle?
- Yeah, something like that.

987
00:56:21.963 --> 00:56:23.631
Look, we're losing the light.

988
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.592
All we gotta do is got to that village.

989
00:56:26.801 --> 00:56:30.346
So please, pay attention.

990
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:33.850
Do not stray from the group.

991
00:56:36.352 --> 00:56:37.352
let's go.

992
00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:45.695
[suspenseful music]
[birds squawking]

993
00:56:52.285 --> 00:56:53.619
- [Tran] Stay quice.

994
00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:54.829
Sacred burial ground.

995
00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:21.814
[flies buzzing]

996
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:26.152
[Gail groaning]
[Cole coughing]

997
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.404
[Gail coughing]

998
00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:29.613
- Jesus.

999
00:57:34.327 --> 00:57:35.578
[Cole coughing]

1000
00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:37.014
- I thought you said that anaconda

1001
00:57:37.038 --> 00:57:39.290
was the biggest that you'd ever seen.

1002
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:40.498
- It was.

1003
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.710
- Well, this one's...
- Bigger.

1004
00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:44.813
- The males must've come through here

1005
00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:45.880
looking for the female.

1006
00:57:53.721 --> 00:57:56.265
[Cole coughing]

1007
00:57:56.474 --> 00:57:57.474
- Some bullshit.

1008
00:58:01.395 --> 00:58:04.357
[Cole coughing]

1009
00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:05.650
- They took their boats.

1010
00:58:05.858 --> 00:58:06.858
- Good for them.

1011
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.860
Bad for us.

1012
00:58:09.946 --> 00:58:12.114
- Which one's the Mendranang?

1013
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:13.574
- On the right.

1014
00:58:13.783 --> 00:58:15.326
The Tokut keeps going to the left.

1015
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:17.328
Fastest way to Kotabaru.

1016
00:58:17.536 --> 00:58:18.536
- How long?

1017
00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:22.587
- You'll be soaking in a
tub at the Four Seasons

1018
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:23.334
in two days.

1019
00:58:23.542 --> 00:58:25.586
- How, man, we don't even have a boat.

1020
00:58:25.795 --> 00:58:26.837
- We're gonna build one.

1021
00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:29.674
[dramatic music]

1022
00:58:29.882 --> 00:58:32.510
[lighter clicks]

1023
00:58:50.778 --> 00:58:53.406
[both grunting]

1024
00:58:54.907 --> 00:58:57.493
- Man, do that in my
neighborhood, and that's your ass.

1025
00:58:59.161 --> 00:59:00.161
Shit.

1026
00:59:14.135 --> 00:59:16.929
[Kong screeching]

1027
00:59:21.267 --> 00:59:23.811
[Jack sighing]

1028
00:59:36.365 --> 00:59:37.365
- Sam.

1029
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:45.374
What docs this look like to you?

1030
00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:54.215
- My god.

1031
00:59:56.552 --> 00:59:58.179
Perrinia immortalis.

1032
00:59:59.764 --> 01:00:01.807
- Now we know why these snakes are so big.

1033
01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:03.225
- What?

1034
01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:06.145
- Anacondas keep growing
till they die, right?

1035
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.314
And these are the biggest
Snakes Bill's ever Seen.

1036
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:09.761
- Because they're living longer.

1037
01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:10.899
- Exactly.

1038
01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:14.153
Because perrinia immortalis
is part of the food chain.

1039
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.947
These snakes have transcended
the Hayflick limit.

1040
01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:20.493
The chemical in the orchid
does exactly what we predicted.

1041
01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:24.955
And not in theory, in the real world.

1042
01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:28.250
This is proof, Sam, of your
research, carved in stone.

1043
01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.293
- This is proof?

1044
01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.339
It's anecdotal evidence at best.

1045
01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:37.235
- [Jack] Let's get to
the orchid and find out.

1046
01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.803
- You are out of your mind.

1047
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.763
- Do you have any idea how close we are?

1048
01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:57.238
The orchid was found
here on the Mendranang

1049
01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:58.697
just around the next bend.

1050
01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:00.775
We'll be going right past it.

1051
01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:01.825
- No, we won't.

1052
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.370
We are going down the Tokut.

1053
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.972
If we continue down the Mendranang,

1054
01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.624
it's gonna be a week before
we reach another village.

1055
01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.626
I'm not waiting that long for my bath.

1056
01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:18.175
- Yeah, well, it's not up to you.

1057
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.426
- Jack.

1058
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:23.597
Maybe you can just come back.

1059
01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:25.849
- Come back?

1060
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.477
In seven years?

1061
01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:29.686
What if it's not here?

1062
01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:32.189
What if some local farmer decides

1063
01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.692
to slash and burn the entire basin?

1064
01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.044
Instead of the fountain of youth,

1065
01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:37.444
we'll have a giant rice paddy.

1066
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.824
This is our only chance.

1067
01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.032
You know it is.

1068
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:48.080
Do you really wanna give
in when we're thiS close?

1069
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:51.500
- Look, you know I got your back, right?

1070
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.130
We've been in the trenches
100 times together.

1071
01:01:57.673 --> 01:01:59.508
But I'm not going in that jungle.

1072
01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:00.843
- Damn straight, man.

1073
01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:03.678
- Thank you.

1074
01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:14.690
- This is my expedition, and
we're going to the orchid.

1075
01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:15.899
- No.

1076
01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:18.276
We're not.

1077
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.488
- Don't be an idiot, Sam.

1078
01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:26.619
This is bigger than
penicillin, for god's Sake.

1079
01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:28.180
Livce will be saved by this drug.

1080
01:02:28.204 --> 01:02:31.207
People will live longer,
they'll stay young longer.

1081
01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:33.584
If we don't put this to human trials,

1082
01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.353
it's gonna be a crime against humanity.

1083
01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:36.795
- Two people have died already.

1084
01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.356
- Scientists have always
risked their lives

1085
01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.007
to change the world.

1086
01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:41.401
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures

1087
01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.511
for yellow fever, polio, and smallpox.

1088
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.096
We all knew the risks.

1089
01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:47.765
- We thought we did.

1090
01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.725
Until you decided to
Start making decisions

1091
01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:51.060
behind our backs.

1092
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.357
- What are you talking about?

1093
01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:57.966
- Ho offered Bill an extra 50 grand

1094
01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.211
to keep going up the Mendranang,

1095
01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:00.861
even though he knew it wasn't safe.

1096
01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:02.905
- Oh, my god.

1097
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.451
- Is that tru, Jack?

1098
01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:10.889
- I was thinking of the expedetion.

1099
01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:12.539
- You were thinking of your career.

1100
01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:20.214
- Look, you're my assistant.

1101
01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:23.801
I don't need to consult you!

1102
01:03:29.515 --> 01:03:31.267
I'm the one with the authority here.

1103
01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:35.437
- We're in the middle of the jungle, Jack.

1104
01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:40.734
At this point, your authority
is what we say it is.

1105
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.989
- Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.

1106
01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:05.883
Thank you.

1107
01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:11.307
[dramatic music]

1108
01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.726
- [Tran] Okay, keep it high.

1109
01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:19.105
Careful.

1110
01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:22.401
Center it right here.

1111
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:23.609
[Kong chattering]

1112
01:04:23.736 --> 01:04:25.195
- [Bill] All right.

1113
01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.501
- [Sam] What re you doing?

1114
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.837
- Never seen a man shave before?

1115
01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.339
[Bill grunts]

1116
01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:47.176
- Probably a lot Sharper before
you attacked that alligator.

1117
01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.384
- Crocodile.

1118
01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:52.013
- What's that mean?

1119
01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.309
- That means a new beginning.

1120
01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:56.852
It's Korean.

1121
01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.729
I got it when I was in the military.

1122
01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.023
- What brought you here?

1123
01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.942
- Long story.

1124
01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:05.151
- Where am I gonna go?

1125
01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.403
- All right.

1126
01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.199
Here's the deal.

1127
01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.368
I was in the Special Forces,

1128
01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:17.456
and I saw and did things
that I wanted to forget.

1129
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.227
Sometimes we do the wrong things

1130
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.795
for the right reasons, you know?

1131
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.923
- It's not very long, as stories go.

1132
01:05:27.383 --> 01:05:28.383
- Yeah.

1133
01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:31.887
Well, I got out of the military,

1134
01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:34.556
came here and bought the Bloody Mary.

1135
01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.726
Just wanted to start a new life.

1142
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.659

1145
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:54.052
- Let me explain.

1146
01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:58.348
- Why in the hell didn't
you tell me about this?

1147
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.357
- The minute someone makes a
call, thiS expedition's over.

1148
01:07:07.566 --> 01:07:09.026
- Exactly.

1149

[phone beeping]

1150
01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:12.446
- All I'm asking for is a few more hours.

1151
01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:16.450
We continue on the Mendranang,
take our orchid Samples,

1152
01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:17.326
then we call for help.

1153
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.328
- Forget about it, Jack, all right?

1154
01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.497
I'm getting us out of here.

1155
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.082
- Think about this, Gordon.

1156
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:26.001
You're about to become a billionaire.

1157
01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:28.438
Do you really wanna give all that up?

1158
01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:30.714
- I don't care about the money, all right?

1159
01:07:30.923 --> 01:07:31.923
I wanna live.

- Resting his feet.

1175
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:39.616
- Should I go get him?
- No, no.

1176
01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:41.546
Let him rest till we
get everything loaded.

1177

- [Gail] Okay.

1178

What did you do to him, Jack?

1186

- [Gail] What is it?

1187
01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:04.848
- Something is wrong with Mitchell.

1188

- What re you talking about?

1189
01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:07.601
- You were in there alone with him.

1190
01:10:07.788 --> 01:10:08.788
What did you do?

1191
01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:10.767
- He was resting his feet.

1192
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:11.791

1210
01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.150
With what, Sam?

1211
01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:20.777
- We gotta get to the raft.

1212
01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:22.487
It's our only way out of here.

1213
01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:25.574
- FYl, Bill, the raft is gone!

1214
01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.159
- We can get it back.

1215
01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:28.869
- How, huh?

1216
01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:30.579
How, we gonna swim after it now?

1217
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.417
- Look, the village is here.

1218
01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.379
Jack is following the Mendranang.

1219
01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:41.465
We cut across the jungle.

1220
01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.759
We can catch him on the other side.

1221
01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.051
- Right.

1222
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.386
- Catch him where?

1223
01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:47.846
- He's going to that orchid.

1224
01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:51.641
We find that flower,

1225
01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.269
we find that raft.

It's Jack Byron.

Listen, something terrible has happened.

1229
01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.921
We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.

1230
01:12:21.129 --> 01:12:22.631
We went over a waterfall.

1231
01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:25.383
I haven't seen anyone since.

1232
01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:28.929
I think I'm the only one loft.

1233
01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:33.683

[anaconda hissing]

1240
01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:55.914
- It's in front of us.

1241

- Son of a bitch.

1242
01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:58.416
It's trying to separate us.

1243
01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:01.670
- [Sam] What?

1244
01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:06.716
- Oh, shit.

Oh, Christ, it's everywhere.

1246
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:09.711
- Turn that goddamn thing off.

1247
01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:11.429
They can see it.
- Doesn't matter.

1248
01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:13.265
They can sense our body heat.

1249
01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:14.473
- He's right.
