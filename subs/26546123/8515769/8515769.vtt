00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.218
(electricity crackling)

2
00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:33.367
(Trumpets playing music)

3
00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:40.107
- [Narrator] This is a story
of a couple madly in love.

4
00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:43.945
So mad, they drove
each other crazy.

5
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.580
- [Abby] Oh, fuck
you, Travis Maddox.

6
00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:46.648
- [Travis] Fuck you!

7
00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.116
- You know, for someone

8
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.250
who claims they're
not a toxic male,

9
00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.586
you don't do a very good job.

10
00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:52.720
- Awww, wahh!

11
00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:54.756
Another 10 point loss for Travis

12
00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:56.958
and Abby's stupid
married contest.

13
00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:58.258
- Aw, don't worry.

14
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.595
You lost that contest
a very long time ago.

15
00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:01.663
- Oh, really?

16
00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.297
Did you give yourself
a 10 point reduction

17
00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.700
when you ran with your
titties out on a public beach?

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.635
Or, or how about this morning?

19
00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:08.870
Was your boyfriend surprised

20
00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:10.805
to see the carpets
match the drapes?

21
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.009
(Sister Bertrille growls)

22
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.844
- You're gonna let
Mother Theresa push you

23
00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:18.145
around like that?

24
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.782
- Por favor, let's start
from the beginning.

25
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.483
Tell me how you fell in love.

26
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:24.919
(Abby sighs)

27
00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:27.922
- Well, it all
started at the circle.

28
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:29.557
(guitar music plays)

29
00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:30.758
It's this underground
fight club.

30
00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.026
I'm a pretty big deal at.

31
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.461
- (laughs) Oh, the ego on you.

32
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.898
- [Travis] From the
moment I saw her,

33
00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:38.700
I couldn't take my
eyes off of her,

34
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:42.036
which was a mistake because
I was fighting somebody.

35
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.705
Then I caught her
Insta-stalking me,

36
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.808
which was creepy, if
she wasn't so adorable.

37
00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:49.544
- [Abby] I was not
Insta-stalking.

38
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:51.079
Okay, maybe I was.

39
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.280
But he was all I
could think about.

40
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.783
- [Travis] Then we went on
this really romantic date

41
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.586
and I knew she was the one.

42
00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:01.689
- [Abby] Yeah, but I thought
he was a total player.

43
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.926
He had a drawer full of
sex toys and condoms.

44
00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:06.360
- [Travis] So I
made a bet with her.

45
00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.664
And if I won, she'd have to
be my roommate for a month.

46
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:10.531
Platonically.

47
00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:11.666
- Wall of China.

48
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.200
I lost the bet.

49
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.037
And yeah, he was
charming, but crazy.

50
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.039
And I didn't wanna date crazy.

51
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.542
I wanted a nice, normal
guy like Parker Hayes.

52
00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:22.309
(Travis screams)

53
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.310
- Oh God.
(Abby shrieks)

54
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.779
- [Abby] Who he terrorized.

55
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:25.780
- Why are you bringing that up?

56
00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:26.814
- Because that's what happened.

57
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:28.348
- Okay, Miss Honesty,

58
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.551
Why don't we talk about your
morning flogging of the Bishop?

59
00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:31.953
- Bishop Gomez?

60
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.954
- No, it's a euphemism.

61
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.122
She was giving me a hand job.

62
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.322
- This is not a confession.

63
00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.959
- He's a priest
- And you're an asshole!

64
00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.360
Anyhow, against my
better judgment,

65
00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:41.763
I fell madly in love with him.

66
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.732
He even took me home
to meet his brothers.

67
00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.968
And just as everything was
going great, I get abducted

68
00:02:47.035 --> 00:02:48.670
by this Vegas gangster Benny,

69
00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:51.105
because I happened to
be very good at poker.

70
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.106
- [Travis] And then I saved her.

71
00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.374
- [Abby] And then I saved him.

72
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.411
- [Travis] And then we
found her stolen money.

73
00:02:57.477 --> 00:03:01.214
Ran away from the bad guys
and lived happily ever after.

74
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.718
- [Abby] Except we're not
happily, I mean happy.

75
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.252
Which is why we're here.

76
00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.390
- Okay, why don't we start
at Happily Ever After?

77
00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.593
Was that your wedding night?

78
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.861
- [Both] Ehh.

79
00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.096
- That's a little unclear.

80
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.097
- Yeah.

81
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.364
We were fucked up.

82
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:19.266
- Okay, how about we
start six days ago.

83
00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.434
When we woke up.

84
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.669
(Travis blows raspberry)

85
00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:22.837
- [Priest] That
might be helpful.

86
00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:26.273
(slow, music playing)

87
00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:41.155
♪ What can I do ♪

88
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.024
I never want leave
this bed, pigeon.

89
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.761
♪ Oh, I love you. ♪

90
00:03:46.828 --> 00:03:50.531
♪ And what can I say ♪

91
00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:51.431
- Oh, baby.

92
00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:55.503
(moans) Yeah, babe.

93
00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:56.303
- Shep?

94
00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.772
- I know what you want, babe.

95
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:02.442
I always say you want the magic,
Maddox fingers, don't you?

96
00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:05.613
Ooh, tickle, tickle.

97
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.620
You're not Mare.

98
00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:15.455
Mare has brown eyes!

99
00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:18.325
- What are you guys doing?

100
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.459
- [Both] Nothing.

101
00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:21.361
- Where's Mare?

102
00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:22.697
- Mare?

103
00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.232
- Yeah.

104
00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.233
- Where is Mare?

105
00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.601
- I don't know.
(Travis groans)

106
00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:29.604
- Mare, pumpkin, where are you?

107
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.304
- What the fuck
happened last night?

108
00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:32.807
- What the hell
happened last night?

109
00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.041
- I, I don't know.

110
00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:34.909
I don't know.

111
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.210
- [Abby] Whoa.

112
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.277
- Where did all this
money come from?

113
00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.579
- [Travis] Benny.

114
00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:40.948
- [Abby] No, this is
Benny's money right here.

115
00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:42.449
- I'm confused.

116
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.086
- Oh, I think I went
gambling last night.

117
00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.487
- Oh my God, what is going on?

118
00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.959
Oh, guys, hey were on TV.

119
00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:52.727
- [Abby] (laughs) Oh my God.

120
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:53.828
(Shepley laughs)

121
00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:54.962
- [America] I guess you won?

122
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.063
- Good work.

123
00:04:56.164 --> 00:04:56.898
- [Shepley] So we all split it?

124
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:57.832
- [Abby] Lucky 13.

125
00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.766
- [America] (laughs) Oh!

126
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.168
- [Shepley] Oh there
you go, camera.

127
00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:01.035
- (laughing) I have
no memory of that!

128
00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:01.903
- I don't remember that.

129
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:02.570
I wonder what we sang?

130
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.775
- Again, you took care of me.
- Yeah, 'cause I love you.

131
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.844
- Oh, babe.

132
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.946
- [America] Yeah.

133
00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.014
- I fingered Travis.

134
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.981
- What?
- What?

135
00:05:14.048 --> 00:05:15.550
- What?
- What?

136
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.519
- What?

137
00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.521
- That's not real.

138
00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:22.990
I wouldn't do that.

139
00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:25.392
- It looks pretty real.

140
00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.230
- Oh, shit guy, guys.

141
00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:30.798
Look, look, look at the screen.

142
00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:33.301
- That's not real.
(group laughing)

143
00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.669
That's, that's just us
goofing around, right?

144
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:36.571
- [Shepley] That, that's funny.

145
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.807
- Oh, shit.

146
00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:42.543
- [Abby] Oh my God.

147
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.312
- Okay, Okay, Abby.

148
00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:45.112
- [Abby] Oh my god, we
got married last night?

149
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.913
- Abby, its okay.

150
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.781
Look at me.

151
00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:47.949
- Oh my God.

152
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.050
- This probably isn't
an ideal way to do this,

153
00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.017
but I love you.

154
00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:51.418
I really do love you and,

155
00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.553
and I wish that
my family was here

156
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.288
to see you and me like this.

157
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.022
I love you.

158
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.025
(vomiting sound)

159
00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:01.829
(rock 'Wedding March' playing)

160
00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:07.400
- [Travis] Oh, Abby.

161
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.803
- That's not what we needed.

162
00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:11.072
Well, hey, listen,
on the bright side,

163
00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:12.472
I thought that, (gags)

164
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.009
I thought that speech
was very romantic.

165
00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:17.879
(phone ringing)

166
00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:21.682
- (clears throat) Hello.

167
00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:24.185
- [Phone] Hi, this is at the
front desk with a reminder

168
00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:25.586
that checkout was an hour ago.

169
00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:30.625
So there's gonna be a
surcharge of about $180,000.

170
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.160
You fucking ass-clowns.

171
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.795
- [Abby] Wait, is that Benny?

172
00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:35.796
- Benny?

173
00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:36.664
- Who's Benny?

174
00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:37.464
- Benny?

175
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.599
- No, no, no I got this.

176
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.667
Don't worry.
- No, I got this.

177
00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:40.701
Benny?

178
00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:41.736
- What is it with
your generation

179
00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:43.604
and the utter lack of manners?

180
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.906
There's no good morning,

181
00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.107
how's your day?

182
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:47.742
- Look, I know all about
the con that you and my dad

183
00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.177
and Jesse tried to screw
me over with, okay?

184
00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:51.879
- Yeah, that's ancient history.

185
00:06:51.946 --> 00:06:55.182
This is about Travis,
assuming your debt

186
00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:57.184
by fighting against Chernobyl.

187
00:06:57.285 --> 00:06:59.086
Money that I did not get back.

188
00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:00.087
- I have it.

189
00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:01.622
I'm hanging up on you.

190
00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.491
- Well, I can see who wears
the balls in this relationship.

191
00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:07.895
I want to see the two of
you in my office in an hour.

192
00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:10.831
And don't you even
think of skipping town.

193
00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:12.533
Buh-bye.

194
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.501
- At least Let me

195
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:14.235
(slamming phone)

196
00:07:14.302 --> 00:07:15.069
- Come on, pool.

197
00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.370
Let's go.

198
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.104
Don't fucking look
at me like that.

199
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:18.506
Let's go.

200
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:20.875
- He's bluffing.

201
00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:21.842
- Yeah.

202
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.812
(knocking on door)

203
00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:33.020
(door beeps and clicks)

204
00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:34.088
- Gun!

205
00:07:34.188 --> 00:07:35.856
(Shepley screams)

206
00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:36.524
- Oh my God!

207
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.059
Get him, get him!

208
00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:44.131
Good job, baby.

209
00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:45.099
- [Man 1] No!

210
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.133
- [Shepley] Get in there!

211
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.501
- I'm proud of you.

212
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:48.903
- [Travis] Did you just
fucking kick my cousin?

213
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.538
(grunting)

214
00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:51.272
- He's down.

215
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:52.573
It's okay.

216
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.341
Give you something to
cool down with.(laughs)

217
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:54.108
- Oh God.

218
00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:55.543
Oh, oh my God.

219
00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:56.344
- [Both] Guys.

220
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.178
- [Abby] Guys, no.

221
00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:58.045
- Oh yeah.

222
00:07:58.112 --> 00:07:59.113
- Oh yeah.

223
00:07:59.213 --> 00:07:59.981
You like that?

224
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:00.881
- [Both] You thirsty?

225
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:01.449
- Okay.

226
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:02.183
- Drink up!

227
00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.017
- There you go.

228
00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:04.418
- Guys?

229
00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:05.286
- [Travis] Hold on,
we're almost done.

230
00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:06.020
- [Shepley] Hold on.

231
00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:07.121
- Guys!

232
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.422
(gurgling)

233
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.557
- Oops.

234
00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:11.692
- Hello?

235
00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:14.161
Anyone home?

236
00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:15.896
Jerry?

237
00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:16.664
- Attention!

238
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:19.834
(military drumming)

239
00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:24.438
Jerry won't be joining us.

240
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.240
Stupid son-of-a-bitch
did that keto thing

241
00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:28.442
and is now pissing kidney
stones the size of leema beans.

242
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.810
- Lima.

243
00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:30.344
- Huh?

244
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.512
- And you are?

245
00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:32.747
- Chief Warrant
Officer Delroy Murphy.

246
00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:36.250
But my friends and
enemies call me Buzz.

247
00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:42.256
- Hi, Buzz.

248
00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:45.860
- Lady Hawk and I will be
flying you down to Meh-hee-co.

249
00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.094
- That thing can't
fly to Mexico.

250
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:49.463
- Don't tell me my
business, sweet peach.

251
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.700
Lady Hawk has been
retrofitted and modified!

252
00:08:53.434 --> 00:08:55.069
The Millennium fucking Falcon.

253
00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.604
- (chuckles) Star Wars!

254
00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:01.042
- I'll take you
down to Meh-hee-co.

255
00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:04.378
No passports, no questions.

256
00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:08.082
The whole enchilada
for 10 grand.

257
00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:08.949
- Wow, that's pretty-

258
00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:10.351
- We'll take it.

259
00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:12.253
What, like we have a choice?

260
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:14.488
(military drumming)

261
00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:15.756
Here.

262
00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:17.391
Here's 5K now,

263
00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:18.592
and then I'll give you the rest

264
00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:20.461
when we make it
there in one piece.

265
00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:21.462
- I like your style.

266
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:22.496
- Okay, what about getting back?

267
00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.365
- That's not my problem, Slotty.

268
00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:27.701
(military drumming)

269
00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:31.238
- Okay, um, you guys have fun
with, uh, Lando Calrissian

270
00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:33.240
and his macho-

271
00:09:33.307 --> 00:09:34.775
(Van revs)

272
00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:36.110
(helicopter door slams)

273
00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:39.914
(helicopter blades whirring)

274
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:44.785
(happy music playing)

275
00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:50.091
- Roger (laughs)

276
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.126
Whoa, this is so cool.

277
00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:53.661
Wireless headsets.

278
00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:56.097
Hey Buzz, you got
Spotify on this?

279
00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:57.765
- You want an ass-whippin'?

280
00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:59.934
- I'm gonna be, uh,
really honest right now.

281
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.770
This whole, uh, Vegas
gangster combined

282
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.107
with fleeing to Mexico
got me really on edge.

283
00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:09.176
So I'm assuming that no one
has any Xanax or alcohol.

284
00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:11.378
So I'm gonna need you

285
00:10:11.479 --> 00:10:12.413
- Oh, babe.

286
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.548
- [America] to follow me

287
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:14.782
- My sternum.

288
00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:16.585
- Into whatever the
fuck that thing is

289
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.920
and send me into
a dopamine coma.

290
00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:20.955
- Okay.

291
00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.559
Hello, Mile High Club.

292
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.595
(Indistinct)

293
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.995
- They're gonna
have so much fun.

294
00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:28.996
- This is fun.

295
00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:29.663
- Yeah.

296
00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:30.698
- This is fun.

297
00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:33.868
(soft music playing)

298
00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.440
- A hundred and thirty-eight
thousand, seven hundred

299
00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:41.041
and ninety-eight dollars.

300
00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:41.976
- Damn.

301
00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:44.845
- What you doing?

302
00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.747
- I am texting Sancho.

303
00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:48.215
- Who is Sancho?

304
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:51.185
- He's the concierge at a
luxury villa in Gatito, Mexico

305
00:10:51.252 --> 00:10:52.486
that I just booked.

306
00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.455
- Sounds out of our price range.

307
00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:57.158
- You just said that
we have $138,000.

308
00:10:57.258 --> 00:10:57.992
- Yeah, but I-

309
00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.193
- [Abby] And it's my honeymoon.

310
00:10:59.260 --> 00:10:59.860
- Well, sure.

311
00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.996
- It's my honeymoon.

312
00:11:03.397 --> 00:11:04.131
- Hey, Buzz?

313
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:04.965
- [Buzz] Yeah?

314
00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.500
- We're going to Gatito, Mexico.

315
00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:07.602
- [Buzz] Copy that.

316
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:09.203
- Thanks.

317
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.237
- Happy wife, happy wife.

318
00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.907
- [Buzz] Oh yeah,
that is, that is true.

319
00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:19.013
- Happy wife, happy life.

320
00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:21.882
Oh, come on.

321
00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:24.285
- What?

322
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.021
- You can't tell me that you're
not freaking out about this.

323
00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:31.158
Travis, we're married.

324
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:35.029
That means that you're
stuck with me forever.

325
00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:37.898
- Well, I have had
some reservations.

326
00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:41.435
Like the fact that
you're beautiful, smart.

327
00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:43.638
Can make us a fortune of
money in less than an hour.

328
00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:48.042
But, I will never, ever
find anyone like you.

329
00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.513
- Love you so much.

330
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.816

(happy music playing)

332
00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:15.503
- [Buzz] Rise and
shine sleepyheads.

333
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:18.806
We have arrived at
your destination.

334
00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:22.776
Open the door, and get some air.

335
00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:24.278
Take in the view.

(happy music playing)

341
00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:47.801
- If you get into trouble,
you know where to find me.

342
00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:50.304
I also do hostage and
rescue situations.

343
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:51.573
- Thanks.

344
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.307
Well, you're a man
of your word, Buzz,

345
00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:55.209
So, here you go.

346
00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:56.110
Thank you.

347
00:13:00.682 --> 00:13:03.150

think it's this way.

- Don't touch me.

364
00:13:56.236 --> 00:14:00.341
(Mariachi band
continues playing)

365
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.819
- Okay, Welcome!

366
00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:12.119
Bienvenidos!

367
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:17.592
This is the room of living.

368
00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:19.059
Here, we have everything.

369
00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:20.027
If you have no clothes,

370
00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:21.763
I will give you clothes.

371
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.297
- Do you have ESPN?

372
00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:25.299
Because the Sacramento kings
are in the NBA finals tonight,

373
00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.267
and I've waited my
whole life for this.

374
00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.936
- ESPN, yes.

375
00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.639
Yes, S-U-V, D-U-J.

376
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.541
We have everything.

377
00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:37.378
- Right, but do you have ESPN?

378
00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.347
- (singing) I make
dreams come true!

379
00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:45.986
Look, my friend, Blondie.

380
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:47.354
You don't worry.

381
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:50.792
We have it, we have
it, we have it.

382
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.127
Come on, come,
come, come with me.

383
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:55.597
Come, come, come, come, come.

384
00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.699
Come, come, come, come.

385
00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.969
Señor Shepley y
Señorita Estados Unidos.

386
00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:03.538
- [America] (singing)
That's not my name.

387
00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:05.205
- Come, come, come.

388
00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:06.106
Un momento.

389
00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:07.776
(Travis sighs)

390
00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:09.042
- Oh, he said to wait.

391
00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.345
- Yeah, that's not
happening, Señora Maddox.

392
00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:14.248
- Who says I'm
taking Señora Maddox?

393
00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:16.250
I like my name.

394
00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.252
Abby Abernathy is a great name.

395
00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:19.821
It has a really good flow to it.

396
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.423
Oh, but Travis Abernathy?

397
00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:24.258
You could be trendsetting.

398
00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:26.326
- You want to castrate me too?

399
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:27.995
- (laughs) No.

400
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:29.597
- Hey, wait!

401
00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:30.698
- What?

402
00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:34.001
- You almost just
crossed the threshold.

403
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.170
- Oh!

404
00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:38.038
- It's bad luck, you know.

405
00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:40.474
You know we Maddoxes have our
own form of this tradition?

406
00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:41.375
- Really?

407
00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:42.342
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:43.745
(Abby shrieks)

409
00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:45.979
- Well, this isn't too barbaric.

410
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.582
- [Travis] Horny.

411
00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:48.449
- [Abby] Oh my God!

412
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.316
This is so cute.

413
00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.417
- [Travis] Yeah!

414
00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:51.351
- Look, look, look,
it has our initials!

415
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:52.386
Wait, hold on.

416
00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:53.387
Wait, wait, wait, I
wanna get a photo.

417
00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:53.888
I wanna get a photo.

418
00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:55.122
Okay.

419
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:57.224
No, I want you to
hold me for the photo.

420
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:57.958
- Okay.

421
00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:58.893
- Lift me up.

422
00:15:58.959 --> 00:15:59.761
- [Travis] Lifting. (groans)

423
00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:00.595
- Smile.

424
00:16:00.662 --> 00:16:02.196
- Okay, okay, okay.

425
00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:02.996
- Okay.

426
00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:04.699
Now get one of me on the bed.

427
00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:09.504
No, actually will
you hold it lower

428
00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:11.271
and then will you flip it?

429
00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:12.172
You like it?

430
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.541
- [Travis] I like it, yeah.

431
00:16:13.608 --> 00:16:14.709
- Okay, will you do one
more flipped the other way?

432
00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:15.777
- Got it, I got it, I got it.

433
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:16.911
- Got it?
- [Travis] I got it.

434
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:17.545
- Okay, do you want
one on the bed?

435
00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:18.713
- No.

436
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.250
- (gasps) No, but it was so
cute with our initials on it.

437
00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:24.184
- T and A.

438
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.787
It stands for titty and ass,

439
00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:27.387
cuz you got the best.

440
00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.323
(Abby shouts)

441
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:31.793
- You are such a neanderthal.

442
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.728
- Ooo-gah, Ooo-gah.

443
00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.531
- (laughs) Ooh-gah?

444
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:38.232
- Ooo-gah hate this pillow.

445
00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.668
- [Abby] This Ooo-gah wanna
consummate his marriage?

446
00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:41.803
- Ooo-gah wanna fuck.

447
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.670
- [Abby] Yeah?

448
00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:44.271
- Ooo-gah.

449
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:44.806
Ooo-gah.

450
00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:46.541
(Abby laughs)

451
00:16:46.608 --> 00:16:50.077
(soft music playing)

452
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:58.285
(mariachi band playing
'La Cucaracha')

453
00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.253
- Adios!

454
00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.788
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you!

455
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:01.890
- No, gracias!

456
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.957
- No, thank you.

457
00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:06.093
- [Travis] Thank
you, no, no, no.

458
00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:09.931
I don't know about you,

459
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.966
but hearing a
traditional Mexican song

460
00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.702
about a cockroach really
gets me in the mood.

461
00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:16.103
- Here.

462
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:17.705
How about this?

463
00:17:17.772 --> 00:17:18.606
(soft music plays)

464
00:17:18.673 --> 00:17:20.107
- Thank you, much better.

465
00:17:21.174 --> 00:17:22.342
Where were we?

466
00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:23.377
- Come here.

467
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:32.520
- Condoms.

468
00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:35.122
Shit.

469
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.258
- Is this the only
protection we have?

470
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:40.628
- I didn't bring any.

471
00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:41.495
Did you?

472
00:17:41.563 --> 00:17:42.630
- No.

473
00:17:42.697 --> 00:17:43.998
- Wait a minute.

474
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.433
We don't need protection,
we're married.

475
00:17:46.534 --> 00:17:47.467
(Travis hisses)

476
00:17:47.535 --> 00:17:49.037
- Easy, Dracula.

477
00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:52.139
I'm too young to be married,
let alone have a kid.

478
00:17:53.808 --> 00:17:56.611
- (sighs) We can pull out.

479
00:17:56.678 --> 00:17:57.912
- No.

480
00:17:57.979 --> 00:18:00.280
- I have complete control over
my seminal fluid emission.

481
00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:02.282
- That's a cliche that's
caused like thousands

482
00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.151
of unwanted pregnancies.

483
00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:08.823
We could do other things.

484
00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:11.158
Other things like,

485
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.328
(lively music playing)

486
00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:15.162
this.

487
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.198
- That's interesting.

488
00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:24.438
I was thinking other
things like this.

489
00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:29.611
- Ooh, that's interesting.

490
00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:32.714
- Yeah, this is good.

491
00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:35.315
This is better actually.

492
00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:37.619
- This is fun.

493
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:39.020
- This is fun.

494
00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.220
I'm glad we're doing this.

495
00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:42.056
- Right, I'm glad
we're doing this.

496
00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.390
We should really
do it more often.

497
00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:43.992
- I agree.

498
00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:45.660
No, this is great.

499
00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:46.493
Those are my balls.

500
00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.529
- Mmm-hmm.

501
00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:49.697
- It's cool.

502
00:18:49.764 --> 00:18:50.665
- A little faster?

503
00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:53.668
- Yeah, let's go
really fast right now.

504
00:18:53.735 --> 00:18:55.469
Let's kick this up a notch.

505
00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.806
- Are you satisfied?

506
00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:00.207
I'm satisfied.

507
00:19:01.876 --> 00:19:02.810
- No.

508
00:19:02.877 --> 00:19:04.211
- Come here.

509
00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:06.346
Okay.

510
00:19:07.414 --> 00:19:08.616
Get 'em off, get 'em off.

511
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.023
We're gonna be safe, right?

512
00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:16.057
- Yeah.

513
00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:17.692
- You're not gonna get a drop!

514
00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:18.559
- I promise.

515
00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:19.560
- Got it?

516
00:19:19.627 --> 00:19:20.227
- Mm-hmm.

517
00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.631
(lively music playing)

518
00:19:25.298 --> 00:19:26.100
- Just an inch.

519
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.234
- An inch.

520
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.570
- Just an inch.

521
00:19:29.637 --> 00:19:30.370
(ding)

522
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.238
(cartoon penis woos)

523
00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:33.975
(Abby moans)

524
00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:34.976
- Yeah.
- [Travis] Yeah.

525
00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:36.611
- It's a nice inch.

526
00:19:36.678 --> 00:19:38.813
(Travis chuckles)

527
00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:40.114
Maybe like a little-

528
00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:41.348
- Another inch?

529
00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.349
- A little bit more,
like another inch?

530
00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:43.450
Yeah, maybe another inch.

531
00:19:43.551 --> 00:19:44.118
(ding)

532
00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:44.986
(cartoon penis woos)

533
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.521
- Another inch?

534
00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:48.556
- Yeah.

535
00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.092
But maybe like a,

536
00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.594
- You're gonna have
to be more clear.

537
00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:54.595
- No, I just-

538
00:19:54.662 --> 00:19:55.462
- I don't under-

539
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.263
(ding)

540
00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.598
(cartoon penis roars)

541
00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:00.400
(Travis moans)

542
00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:02.804
- Now, that's in.

543
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.272
- That feels way better
without the rubber.

544
00:20:05.338 --> 00:20:06.641
Yeah, like, whoa.

545
00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:07.508
(Abby moans)

546
00:20:07.575 --> 00:20:08.576
Okay.

547
00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:09.242
Oh.

548
00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:12.146
(both moaning)

549
00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.749
Babe, you're blacking
my escape hatch.

550
00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:15.717
- Oh, I'm so close.

551
00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.885
- Oh, I know, but so am I.

552
00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:19.987
That's why this is a problem.

553
00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.656
- Oh, Goddammit!

554
00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:22.757
(Travis groans)

555
00:20:22.824 --> 00:20:24.792
(Abby screams)

556
00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:26.861
Go get me a condom, like now!

557
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:28.129
- Where?

558
00:20:28.196 --> 00:20:29.463
It's not like there's a
CVS across the street.

559
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.765
- I don't know, Shepley.

560
00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:31.766
Shepley must have condoms.

561
00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.433
- Okay, fine, I'm going.

562
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.838
(Lively music playing)

563
00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:39.941
(knocking on door)

564
00:20:40.007 --> 00:20:41.909
(girls shout)

565
00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:43.044
Hola!

566
00:20:43.111 --> 00:20:44.277
No, no, don't touch the pillow.

567
00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:49.316
(Mariachi band plays
'La Cucaracha')

568
00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:52.754
- Hey, Travis?

569
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.056
You got any condoms, you
got any condoms on you?

570
00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:56.691
Because I, because I ran out.

571
00:20:56.791 --> 00:21:00.061
(mariachi band
continues playing)

572
00:21:00.128 --> 00:21:02.663
(thunder crashing)

573
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.331
(Abby sighs)

574
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:07.467
(waves crashing)

575
00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:09.570
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

576
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.742
(metal clinks)
(insects chirping)

577
00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:18.478
(Sancho speaking in Spanish)

578
00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:19.714
(Travis speaking in Spanish)

579
00:21:19.814 --> 00:21:21.182
- [Sancho] You look
like a man in love.

580
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.315
- Thank you.

581
00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:24.051
- A man's man in love.
- Thanks.

582
00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:25.586
- A man's man-

583
00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:26.788
- Where's my wife?
- Man.

584
00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.623
(insects chirping)
(gentle music)

585
00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:30.691
She's ready.
(gentle music)

586
00:21:30.758 --> 00:21:33.094
(shoes clacking)

587
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.796
- Ta-da!
(insects chirping)

588
00:21:34.896 --> 00:21:35.963
- Wow.

589
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.932
You look amazing.
- Thank you.

590
00:21:38.032 --> 00:21:39.267
(shoes clacking)
(gentle music)

591
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:40.367
So do you.

592
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:45.606
(Sancho speaking in Spanish)

593
00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:49.010
(gentle music)
(insects chirping)

594
00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:52.747
(shoes clacking)
(gentle music)

595
00:21:52.847 --> 00:21:56.584
- Wow. Look at this.
- This is beautiful.

596
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:57.518
Thank you.

597
00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:00.521
- Eh, eh, eh, eh.

598
00:22:02.657 --> 00:22:03.191
Sit.

599
00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:04.357
There you go.

600
00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:05.392
There you go.
(Travis clears throat)

601
00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.961
Very good. Very good.

602
00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:12.399
Now, Pino has prepared a
traditional seven-course meal

603
00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:16.137
for newlyweds especially.

604
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:19.406
- Thank you.
- Okay. Enjoy.

605
00:22:21.943 --> 00:22:23.878
(Travis sighs)
Pino?

606
00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:27.014
- Well, here's to us.

607
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:28.883
And happily ever after.

608
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.284
I love you, pigeon.

609
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.652
- I love you too.
(glasses clinking)

610
00:22:31.752 --> 00:22:36.824
(insects chirping)
(gentle music)

611
00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:39.861
So I, I made this.

612
00:22:39.927 --> 00:22:41.262
- I didn't know we
were doing gifts.

613
00:22:41.329 --> 00:22:42.563
- Yeah.

614
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.165
It's just a little something
I made on the flight

615
00:22:44.232 --> 00:22:45.700
while you were sleeping.

616
00:22:46.634 --> 00:22:48.169
Travis, I love you so much.

617
00:22:48.236 --> 00:22:49.436
- I love you too.

618
00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:51.873
What is it?

619
00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:53.741
- [Abby] It's a
pro/con list to see if,

620
00:22:53.808 --> 00:22:56.244
if we should stay married or-
- Or-

621
00:22:56.777 --> 00:22:59.446
- Or we get a quick annulment.

622
00:23:00.848 --> 00:23:01.349
Whoopsies.

623
00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:02.917
What happened?

624
00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:04.886
- Why is it so decorated?

625
00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:06.153
- I thought that maybe

626
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.355
if you saw how much effort,
I put into making it pretty,

627
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.824
you would, you'd maybe like it.

628
00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:10.992
- I don't like it.

629
00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:13.928
This is like getting
cancer news framed.

630
00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:15.229
This is a pro/con list.

631
00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:17.598
- Just to help us gain some
clarity, only while we're here.

632
00:23:17.665 --> 00:23:20.301
And look, I even gave
this a 30-point head start

633
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.603
because you have
the biggest dick.

634
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.705
- Ooh, who's got the big dick?

635
00:23:24.772 --> 00:23:26.040
- This guy.

636
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.308
- I knew it!

637
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:28.910
I knew it! I knew it!

638
00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:33.480
That is why you are so
self-confident. (laughs)

639
00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:36.350
I knew a powerful

640
00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:40.321
and successful man who, alas,

641
00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:41.488
had a small dick,
he was a insecure.

642
00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:42.723
- I'll agree to this

643
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.158
if you get him to
stop talking about it.

644
00:23:44.225 --> 00:23:47.728
- Deal. Sancho, what is this?
- Soup. That is soup.

645
00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:51.365
That is the first course.
Yes.

646
00:23:51.431 --> 00:23:55.102
I shall be back. (laughs)

647
00:23:55.169 --> 00:23:58.105
(gentle music)

648
00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.207
- Yum.
(Travis sighs)

649
00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:02.944
(phone buzzing)
Mm.

650
00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:04.512
This is amazing.

651
00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:06.981
You know, this reminds me of,

652
00:24:07.048 --> 00:24:09.150
of this one time when I
was, I was really young.

653
00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:10.952
I think I was...

654
00:24:11.018 --> 00:24:13.287
I dunno, I must have been
around 12 or, or something.

655
00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:16.390
And my grandmother,
she's passed,

656
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.859
but she was so
funny and wonderful.

657
00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:19.794
- Well, screw her.

658
00:24:20.728 --> 00:24:22.730
- Screw my dead grandmother?

659
00:24:22.797 --> 00:24:24.432
- Oh.

660
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.801
When do I get to meet her?
- What?

661
00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:28.269
Travis, are you listening to me?

662
00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:30.037
- I'm sorry.

663
00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:31.272
I'm not feeling very well.

664
00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:34.241
I do not want to
ruin this moment.

665
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:36.310
I'm gonna run off and throw up,

666
00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:37.311
and I will be right back, okay?

667
00:24:37.378 --> 00:24:40.614
- Oh, no. Okay.
(gentle music)

668
00:24:40.681 --> 00:24:41.749
(gentle upbeat music)

669
00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:45.052
- I love you.
(gentle upbeat music)

670
00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:46.687
So happy we're married.

671
00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:49.690
What's the score?

672
00:24:49.757 --> 00:24:51.025
- Fourth quarter just started.

673
00:24:51.092 --> 00:24:51.993
We're down by 12.

674
00:24:52.093 --> 00:24:52.960
- Fuck!

675
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:54.829
- Yeah.

676
00:24:55.629 --> 00:24:57.865
Dude, you're about
to lose 1,000 bucks.

677
00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:02.970
- Shit!
(door thuds)

678
00:25:05.373 --> 00:25:06.907
- Are you feeling better?
- Uh, yeah.

679
00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:07.842
Feeling better.

680
00:25:07.908 --> 00:25:08.642
Mmm, soup.

681
00:25:08.743 --> 00:25:13.748
(Abby chuckles)
(Travis slurps)

682
00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:17.685
- Oh, somebody liked the soup.

683
00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:21.022
- Ah. It was delicious,
Sancho. I'm stuffed.

684
00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:24.191
- No, that is only the
first course, senor.

685
00:25:24.258 --> 00:25:26.227
There are six more.
- Six?

686
00:25:26.293 --> 00:25:27.361
Can we bring them all out

687
00:25:27.428 --> 00:25:28.596
at the same time?
- Uh, sure.

688
00:25:28.662 --> 00:25:29.964
- That's not how
it works, Travis.

689
00:25:30.064 --> 00:25:31.565
- Oh, well, I'm just
tryna be efficient.

690
00:25:31.665 --> 00:25:32.767
- No, it's okay.

691
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:34.201
Okay, it's not a problem.

692
00:25:34.268 --> 00:25:35.903
I can handle this.

693
00:25:36.003 --> 00:25:36.937
(triangle dings)

694
00:25:37.004 --> 00:25:37.772
Pino!

695
00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:38.973
- It's fine. It's fine.

696
00:25:39.073 --> 00:25:40.941
- No, please.
- I, no triangle.

697
00:25:41.008 --> 00:25:42.343
(triangle dings)

698
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.946
- It always works.

699
00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:48.616
(gentle music)

700
00:25:48.682 --> 00:25:50.117
- Are you okay?

701
00:25:50.184 --> 00:25:52.186
- Yeah. I'm fine.

702
00:25:52.286 --> 00:25:54.221
(food crunching)

703
00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:55.823
So, how's your dad?

704
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.757
- What?

705
00:25:57.825 --> 00:25:59.360
- I'm sorry. (spits)

706
00:25:59.427 --> 00:26:01.128
I was just trying to
make conversation.

707
00:26:01.195 --> 00:26:02.496
I'm not feeling too good.

708
00:26:02.563 --> 00:26:04.765
(gentle upbeat music)

709
00:26:04.832 --> 00:26:05.566
Score?

710
00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:06.467
- (stutters) We're down by two.

711
00:26:06.535 --> 00:26:09.538
- Yes!
(Shepley claps)

712
00:26:09.603 --> 00:26:10.771
- Dude, you can't miss this!
(door thuds)

713
00:26:10.838 --> 00:26:11.772
- Fuck dinner, fuck dinner.

714
00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:12.773
One minute.
- Yeah.

715
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.080
Okay. Go, go, go, go!
- Whoo. (laughs)

716
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.614
(Sancho humming)

717
00:26:20.714 --> 00:26:22.349
- Oh, you can just leave
that next to his soup.

718
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.951
He's not feeling well.

719
00:26:24.018 --> 00:26:25.786
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

720
00:26:25.853 --> 00:26:29.423
- Yeah!
(dishes clanking)

721
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.659
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

722
00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:32.960
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go, baby!

723
00:26:33.027 --> 00:26:34.529
- It's happening!
It's happening!

724
00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:36.531
Come here, come here,
baby! Come here!

How's your tummy?

741
00:27:04.492 --> 00:27:06.127
You look a little bit clammy.

742
00:27:07.361 --> 00:27:10.297

And then you insulted
my dead grandmother.

750

Minus five points.

751

never respect me.

I ever respected you?

hunt one of those things.

807

and it's her favorite movie.

808
00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:56.056

was your favorite movie.

809

- I've always planned
on living in Paris.

810
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.195
- How am I gonna pursue criminal
justice living in Paris?

811
00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:04.064
- I don't know.
(insects chirping)

married after three months.

822
00:31:29.824 --> 00:31:34.596

time ago back when,

823
00:31:34.662 --> 00:31:39.099
Pan Am, I satisfied many.

No, I, I've broken down
a few lavatory doors

827
00:31:45.774 --> 00:31:47.040
on United myself.

828
00:31:47.107 --> 00:31:52.246
- No, (laughs) I knew, we
had something in common.

829
00:31:53.046 --> 00:31:55.717
- Yes, my friend.
- A yeah. Yes. (laughs)

830
00:31:55.784 --> 00:31:57.117

- Uh-oh.

832
00:31:59.052 --> 00:32:01.121
I said something bad.

833
00:32:01.221 --> 00:32:03.991

- What's your problem?

00:32:04.057 --> 00:32:07.261
(insects chirping)

835
00:32:14.602 --> 00:32:18.005
- You wanna talk about it?
(insects chirping)

836
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:19.273
- Talk about what?

837
00:32:20.073 --> 00:32:21.008
How we're married,

838
00:32:21.074 --> 00:32:22.443
and we barely know each other?

839
00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:26.548
- That's not true.
- I mean, kind of.

840
00:32:26.614 --> 00:32:29.483
I wanna move to Paris and
apparently you love having sex

841
00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:30.552
on airplanes.

842
00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:32.720
- Have you ever
stopped to think,

843
00:32:32.787 --> 00:32:34.455
maybe why I'm
against an annulment?

844
00:32:35.489 --> 00:32:37.424
What couple do you know
that has survived one?

845

about Paris, screw it.

Let's move to Paris.

850
00:32:55.108 --> 00:32:56.644
I can promise you,

- Excuse me?
(water sloshing)

857
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.394
Is it anything like shower sex?

858
00:33:14.461 --> 00:33:15.429
- It is.

859
00:33:15.496 --> 00:33:17.197
I only, it's a lot
prettier in the movies.

860
00:33:17.264 --> 00:33:19.233
- Well, I think I'm
gonna pass on anything

861
00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:21.936
of yours entering me until
it's wearing a raincoat.

887

That's a lot of salt, babe.

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:44.045
I thought I'd show you mine.

901
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:45.813
Can't have everything, I guess.

902
00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.248
- Yeah, guess you can't.

903
00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:50.484
(birds chirping)

904
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:55.657
(tense music)
(seagulls squawking)

905
00:35:56.456 --> 00:35:57.357
- Hey, so what's going on?

906
00:35:57.424 --> 00:35:58.626
What happened this morning?

907
00:35:59.426 --> 00:36:00.828
Come on, talk to me.

908
00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:01.829
- Well, there was this guy,

909
00:36:01.896 --> 00:36:02.997
and he was outside juggling

910
00:36:03.064 --> 00:36:04.098
and I've always
wanted to know how to-

911
00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.265
- [Shepley] Mare!
(America groans)

912
00:36:05.332 --> 00:36:06.500
- What is wrong
with everyone today?

913
00:36:06.567 --> 00:36:08.368
- [Shepley] Mare, where are you?

914
00:36:08.435 --> 00:36:10.705
- So your new friend gonna
join us down at the beach?

915
00:36:10.772 --> 00:36:12.106
- His name is Miguel and no,

916
00:36:12.172 --> 00:36:14.709
because you scared
him off your big dick.

917
00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.210
- Mare!

918
00:36:17.277 --> 00:36:18.345
Hey, guys. Hey, hey.

919
00:36:18.412 --> 00:36:21.716
Have you seen Mare?
(birds chirping)

920
00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:24.118
(gentle music)

921
00:36:24.184 --> 00:36:25.753
- Look, I know I
can be possessive.

922
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.788
- You? No.

923
00:36:26.854 --> 00:36:28.823
- I just don't like
when guys touch you.

924
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.390
- Well, Travis, you
have to get over that.

925
00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:32.225
What if I have a male
gynecologist one day?

926
00:36:32.325 --> 00:36:34.162
- Why would you have
a male gynecologist

927
00:36:34.227 --> 00:36:36.263
when there's perfectly
good female gynecologist.

928
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:37.932
(Abby chuckles)
What about female empowerment?

929
00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:39.967
Isn't that what the diversity
movement's all about?

930
00:36:40.068 --> 00:36:42.269
- Oh, my God, I
hate you right now.

931
00:36:42.335 --> 00:36:44.404
- Look who's not
being progressive.

932
00:36:44.471 --> 00:36:46.741
- Mare?
(birds chirping)

933
00:36:46.808 --> 00:36:47.809
Mare?

934
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.812
- You miss me?
- Ugh.

935
00:36:54.048 --> 00:36:55.215
Hey.

936
00:36:55.315 --> 00:36:57.417
Hey, have you guys seen
a small American girl?

937
00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:05.760
- Oh.

938
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.598
- [Both] Whee!

939
00:37:10.698 --> 00:37:12.299
- (stutters) Uh.

940
00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:18.773
(Blanca purrs)

941
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.307
(Abby and Travis laughing)

942
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.285
(Blanca laughing)

943
00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:33.588
- It's a good color, right?
(Abby laughing)

944
00:37:33.654 --> 00:37:34.655
She didn't like
the color before.

945
00:37:34.722 --> 00:37:36.323
- Oh. I didn't.

946
00:37:37.257 --> 00:37:39.326
Oh, yeah. Si.

947
00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:43.865
- Watch. It gets
bigger. (laughs)

948
00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:48.335
It took a while.
(speaking in Spanish)

949
00:37:52.173 --> 00:37:53.406
- Uh!

950
00:37:58.278 --> 00:37:59.614
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

951
00:38:00.748 --> 00:38:01.448
Where'd you go?

952
00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:02.950
- You seemed distracted.

953
00:38:03.017 --> 00:38:04.719
- Well, I was just tryna find
out where our friends were.

954
00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:06.386
I didn't ask them to
take their tops off.

955
00:38:06.453 --> 00:38:08.089
- Oh, okay. (chuckles)

956
00:38:08.156 --> 00:38:08.990
- Look, look, look, look.

957
00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:10.224
It's a topless beach.

958
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.491
See? I don't make
the rules here.

959
00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:13.628
Boobies, boobs, tits.

960
00:38:14.562 --> 00:38:16.097
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs)

961
00:38:16.164 --> 00:38:17.832
Travis, you know
what? You're right.

962
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:18.866
- Thanks. No, honestly.

963
00:38:18.966 --> 00:38:21.368
I wasn't tryna cause
trouble or anything.

964
00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:23.771
What are you doing?

965
00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:25.106
- You said, it was
a topless beach.

966
00:38:25.173 --> 00:38:26.641
- That doesn't
apply to foreigners.

967
00:38:26.707 --> 00:38:28.142
- [Abby] (laughs)
Oh, that is absurd.

968
00:38:28.209 --> 00:38:31.378
- You are absurd!

969
00:38:31.444 --> 00:38:33.214
What is this,
OnlyFans? Fuck off.

970
00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:34.949
- You're a psycho.
(Travis groans)

971
00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:36.818
Leave me alone.

972
00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:38.252
- Cover your titties!

973
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:43.524
(person speaking in Spanish)
(person whistling)

974
00:38:44.725 --> 00:38:46.493
- Come back, baby.
I make movies.

975
00:38:46.594 --> 00:38:47.795
(person speaking in Spanish)

976
00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:51.098
(animal growls)
(explosion booming)

977
00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:56.403
(tense music)
(Travis grunts)

978
00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:01.642
- Mare! Mare!

979
00:39:01.709 --> 00:39:02.677
Mare, look!

980
00:39:02.743 --> 00:39:05.546
Look, I'm shedding
my inhibitions!

981
00:39:06.346 --> 00:39:08.749
(Travis grunts)
(upbeat music)

982
00:39:08.816 --> 00:39:09.917
- Hey, hey, hey.

983
00:39:10.017 --> 00:39:10.985
She's the one that took
her top off. (grunts)

984
00:39:11.085 --> 00:39:13.821
(person grunts)

985
00:39:15.256 --> 00:39:18.826
(speaking in Spanish)
(punches throwns)

986
00:39:19.627 --> 00:39:22.330
(officer speaking in Spanish)
(siren blaring)

987
00:39:22.395 --> 00:39:27.168
(Travis grunts)
(upbeat music)

988
00:39:27.235 --> 00:39:29.003
(glass shatters)
(upbeat music)

989
00:39:29.103 --> 00:39:33.741
(Travis panting and groans)

990
00:39:33.841 --> 00:39:34.575
- Travis!

991
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.914
(person grunts)
(Travis groans)

992
00:39:39.981 --> 00:39:42.316
Hey, blondie. (grunts)

993
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:44.585
(Travis grunts)
(bright music)

994
00:39:49.422 --> 00:39:51.491
Really?
(officer speaking in Spanish)

995
00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:56.163
(birds chirping)
(explosion booming)

996
00:39:56.264 --> 00:40:01.468
(birds chirping)
(insects chirping)

997
00:40:04.437 --> 00:40:07.241
(upbeat music)

998
00:40:07.308 --> 00:40:08.441
- [Benny] Come on, Darius.

999
00:40:08.542 --> 00:40:10.211
Just give me give more minutes.

1000
00:40:10.278 --> 00:40:11.612
- [Darius] Mm.

1001
00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:14.682
- Look, I got a crisis on
my hands, so just please.

1002
00:40:14.749 --> 00:40:15.783
Okay?

1003
00:40:15.883 --> 00:40:16.651
Please.

1004
00:40:17.685 --> 00:40:20.487
What's so important that
you need me on a Sunday?

1005
00:40:22.023 --> 00:40:23.157
What do you mean?

1006
00:40:24.725 --> 00:40:27.061
Her stripper name is Pocahontas.

1007
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:29.297
She needs to wear the headdress.

1008
00:40:29.363 --> 00:40:33.433
I've had enough
of this culturally
inappropriate woke shit.

1009
00:40:33.534 --> 00:40:34.201
The last...

1010
00:40:34.268 --> 00:40:35.002
(Benny screams)

1011
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:36.604
(Hector screams)

1012
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:39.941
What did I tell you
about sneaking up on me?

1013
00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:40.875
- Sorry, sir.

1014
00:40:40.942 --> 00:40:41.742
Sorry.

1015
00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:42.643
Sorry, sir.

1016
00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:46.514
- I'll call you back.

1017
00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:49.350
(Benny laughs)

1018
00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:50.751
- Oh my gosh.

1019
00:40:50.818 --> 00:40:52.687
I guess this is their way
of staying under the radar.

1020
00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:56.123
Asshats.

1021
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.258
Gatito?

1022
00:40:57.325 --> 00:40:58.926
I know this place.

1023
00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:01.662
Darius and I fell
in love down here.

1024
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.298
Call Vince, take a
couple of guys down there

1025
00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:05.666
and go get me my money

1026
00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:07.001
and a couple of fingers.

1027
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:07.868
- Fingers?

1028
00:41:07.935 --> 00:41:09.437
- Yeah, fingers.

1029
00:41:09.537 --> 00:41:10.571
No, no, forget it.

1030
00:41:10.671 --> 00:41:12.006
I'm gonna take care
of this myself.

1031
00:41:12.073 --> 00:41:14.108
What time's the next flight?

1032
00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:15.876
(car revs)

1033
00:41:15.943 --> 00:41:17.044
Darius!

1034
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:19.814
(engine revs)

1035
00:41:21.949 --> 00:41:22.850
Darius!

1036
00:41:23.818 --> 00:41:24.819
D!

1037
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:27.722
(Benny screams)

1038
00:41:27.788 --> 00:41:32.560
- So I posted your bail,

1039
00:41:33.894 --> 00:41:36.230
but since you don't
have passports,

1040
00:41:37.098 --> 00:41:38.566
you're gonna have to wait.

1041
00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:49.710
(crowd speaks in
foreign language)

1042
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.453
- Well, thank you guys
for bailing us out
and being so nice.

1043
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.589
I'm just sorry my
husband is so rude.

1044
00:42:01.655 --> 00:42:03.157
- Well, I wouldn't
have to be so rude

1045
00:42:03.224 --> 00:42:05.026
if my wife would just
respect some of my-

1046
00:42:05.126 --> 00:42:06.327
- Rules?

1047
00:42:06.394 --> 00:42:07.328
Are you gonna
house break me too.

1048
00:42:07.395 --> 00:42:08.896
- I was gonna say requests,

1049
00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:10.331
like when we're on our honeymoon

1050
00:42:10.398 --> 00:42:11.866
surrounded by a
few hundred horny

1051
00:42:11.932 --> 00:42:14.335
spring break TikTok
obsessed douchebags,

1052
00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:15.336
maybe don't show your tit-

1053
00:42:15.403 --> 00:42:16.804
- Oh, do not say the T word.

1054
00:42:16.904 --> 00:42:19.040
If you say the T word, I am
jumping out of this car, Travis

1055
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.940
and out of your life.

1056
00:42:20.007 --> 00:42:21.510
I mean it.

1057
00:42:21.575 --> 00:42:22.243
- That's a bullshit way
to end an argument, Abby.

1058
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:23.344
- I don't care.

1059
00:42:23.411 --> 00:42:25.012
- Then don't show your titties.

1060
00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:26.580
Titties, titties,
titties, titties,

1061
00:42:26.647 --> 00:42:27.681
titties, titties.
- Oh, fuck you, Travis Maddox.

1062
00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:30.117
- Titties, titties!
- Fuck you.

1063
00:42:30.184 --> 00:42:31.719
- Abby, get back here.

1064
00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:33.921
- [Sancho] No, no, wait,
wait, wait, Senor Travis.

1065
00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:34.789
No.

1066
00:42:34.855 --> 00:42:35.823
- Take your hands off me.

1067
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.091
- Miguel can take care of her.

1068
00:42:37.158 --> 00:42:38.459
- She's my wife.

1069
00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:39.693
She just has a bad
habit of running away.

1070
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.296
- Yes, because she
is running from you.

1071
00:42:47.101 --> 00:42:49.403
(men speaking in
foreign language)

1072
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:50.638
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1073
00:42:50.704 --> 00:42:53.107
I was just, I'm just
looking for my ride.

1074
00:42:53.174 --> 00:42:53.974
(glass shatters)

1075
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:55.009
(Abby gasps)

1076
00:42:55.076 --> 00:42:56.911
I was just looking
for a friend of mine.

1077
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.288
- Are you okay?

1078
00:43:07.354 --> 00:43:08.523
- Yeah, yeah.

1079
00:43:08.622 --> 00:43:09.690
That was...

1080
00:43:10.357 --> 00:43:11.926
I could really use a drink.

1081
00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:14.929
Thank you.

1082
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.267
- Hey.

1083
00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:21.402
if you could at least text me

1084
00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:22.636
to let me know you're alive,

1085
00:43:22.736 --> 00:43:24.371
that would be much
fucken appreciated!

1086
00:43:24.472 --> 00:43:25.540
- [America] Jesus.

1087
00:43:25.606 --> 00:43:26.273
Is that the way
you talked to her?

1088
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.241
(Travis groans)

1089
00:43:27.341 --> 00:43:28.109
- What the fuck do you want?

1090
00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:29.677
- What the fuck do...

1091
00:43:31.112 --> 00:43:32.480
Let me be clear.

1092
00:43:33.047 --> 00:43:34.682
I think you're being an asshole.

1093
00:43:34.748 --> 00:43:36.585
And I think that
getting married at 19

1094
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.086
is the dumbest
shit in the world,

1095
00:43:40.888 --> 00:43:42.557
but all I care about right
now is my best friend

1096
00:43:42.656 --> 00:43:44.458
and she's in love with you.

1097
00:43:44.526 --> 00:43:46.293
- Yeah, I love her too.

1098
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.461
What, what's the problem?

1099
00:43:47.529 --> 00:43:49.396
- The problem is
you're suffocating her!

1100
00:43:50.264 --> 00:43:51.232
You're suffocating her

1101
00:43:51.298 --> 00:43:52.733
and she has a bad
habit of disappearing

1102
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.836
and I don't want that to
happen to either of us.

1103
00:43:58.239 --> 00:43:59.840
(gentle acoustic music)

1104
00:43:59.907 --> 00:44:01.976
- Buenas noches, Miguel.

1105
00:44:03.644 --> 00:44:06.180
- Well, aren't
you super popular?

1106
00:44:06.247 --> 00:44:07.047
- [Comrade] Hola, Miguel.

1107
00:44:07.114 --> 00:44:07.848
- Hola.

1108
00:44:07.915 --> 00:44:09.717
That wasn't always the case.

1109
00:44:10.651 --> 00:44:12.853
- I find that so
hard to believe.

1110
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.722
You're way too nice.

1111
00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:17.258
What's your backstory?

1112
00:44:19.393 --> 00:44:20.394
Tell me.

1113
00:44:22.163 --> 00:44:23.565
- Okay, um.

1114
00:44:23.664 --> 00:44:25.432
Well, I'm part
Maldive, part Samoan.

1115
00:44:25.534 --> 00:44:26.700
- Okay.

1116
00:44:26.767 --> 00:44:28.068
- My family moved
here when I was a kid.

1117
00:44:28.135 --> 00:44:29.436
- Okay.

1118
00:44:29.538 --> 00:44:30.905
- They were actually
pretty wealthy.

1119
00:44:30.971 --> 00:44:33.874
You know the house that you
stay at used to be our home.

1120
00:44:34.675 --> 00:44:35.876
- What happened?

1121
00:44:36.944 --> 00:44:39.346
- The government took it
when my father was killed.

1122
00:44:39.413 --> 00:44:40.582
- Miguel, I...

1123
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:42.883
- Oh, don't shed
any tears for him.

1124
00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:44.885
He wasn't a good guy.

1125
00:44:45.953 --> 00:44:48.289
When he was killed, my
mom and I had to restart.

1126
00:44:49.723 --> 00:44:54.028
I was just a very
angry kid, like Angel.

1127
00:44:55.095 --> 00:44:56.764
And then one day,
I got the calling.

1128
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:57.932
- The calling?

1129
00:44:59.934 --> 00:45:00.635
Oh.

1130
00:45:00.701 --> 00:45:02.102
Oh you mean like the calling?

1131
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:03.370
So you're a...

1132
00:45:03.437 --> 00:45:05.472
- Priest in training?

1133
00:45:05.574 --> 00:45:07.274
- I did not see that coming.

1134
00:45:07.341 --> 00:45:08.510
Wow.

1135
00:45:08.577 --> 00:45:11.779
- Tell me, Abby,
have you ever...

1136
00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:13.280
- I mean, I believe,

1137
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.916
but I don't practice
or anything like that.

1138
00:45:16.717 --> 00:45:18.018
- Well, there's a first
time for everything.

1139
00:45:18.085 --> 00:45:19.186
- No.

1140
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:21.255
No, I still got my beer.
- Jesus, we've got another.

1141
00:45:21.322 --> 00:45:22.856
- I'm not that bad.

1142
00:45:22.923 --> 00:45:26.060
(crickets chirping)

1143
00:45:28.729 --> 00:45:31.065
- [Travis] Have we
ever talked like this?

1144
00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:33.200
- Yeah.

1145
00:45:33.267 --> 00:45:35.836
There was that one time
in the laundry room.

1146
00:45:36.337 --> 00:45:37.672
Yeah, you know.

1147
00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:39.807
You know asked me
if I had any soap

1148
00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:42.943
and I said that I
needed to get some.

1149
00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:46.447
- That was nice.

1150
00:45:46.514 --> 00:45:48.949
(America chuckles)

1151
00:45:49.016 --> 00:45:50.217
- Yeah, it's funny.

1152
00:45:50.284 --> 00:45:52.086
You, you don't get
to pick the people

1153
00:45:52.152 --> 00:45:54.188
who your boyfriend
hangs out with.

1154
00:45:54.288 --> 00:45:55.590
- Well, I never
would've picked you.

1155
00:45:55.657 --> 00:45:57.224
- I wouldn't have
picked you either.

1156
00:45:58.759 --> 00:46:00.528
- How long have you known her?

1157
00:46:01.895 --> 00:46:02.963
- Long time.

1158
00:46:07.501 --> 00:46:09.136
- That's pretty cute.

1159
00:46:09.203 --> 00:46:10.804
- You know that kid does
all these great things

1160
00:46:10.904 --> 00:46:13.107
and her parents never
show up for anything?

1161
00:46:14.375 --> 00:46:15.376
That was Abby.

1162
00:46:16.645 --> 00:46:18.846
It's frustrating to watch,

1163
00:46:18.912 --> 00:46:23.150
but Travis, she is not
your problem to solve.

1164
00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:25.486
Okay?

1165
00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:27.388
You just have to give her time.

1166
00:46:27.454 --> 00:46:29.123
I mean, she's had no
stability in her life,

1167
00:46:29.189 --> 00:46:34.395
and you are like this egomaniac
emblem of hyper-masculinity,

1168
00:46:35.929 --> 00:46:38.932
semi-toxic who I actually
hope is, you know, extinct.

1169
00:46:38.999 --> 00:46:39.768
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1170
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:40.735
Where'd that come from?

1171
00:46:40.801 --> 00:46:41.603
- Oh, I'm just teasing you.

1172
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.436
- Jesus!
(body thuds)

1173
00:46:42.537 --> 00:46:43.337
- What the hell?

1174
00:46:43.404 --> 00:46:45.472
(Shepley groans)

1175
00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.074
(Shepley clears throat)

1176
00:46:47.141 --> 00:46:48.008
- Uh.

1177
00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:50.110
Hey guys,

1178
00:46:50.679 --> 00:46:52.479
- Uh, are you okay?

1179
00:46:52.547 --> 00:46:53.480
- Yeah.

1180
00:46:53.548 --> 00:46:54.749
No, I'm (scoffs)...

1181
00:46:54.848 --> 00:46:56.618
Yeah, I was uh, yeah,
I was just stargazing

1182
00:46:56.685 --> 00:46:58.753
at at uh Copernicus and, and...

1183
00:46:58.819 --> 00:47:00.522
- Telescopes over there, bro.

1184
00:47:01.488 --> 00:47:03.290
- Oh, they have one
of those over there.

1185
00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:05.326
- Were you spying on us?

1186
00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:05.993
- No, no, no, no.

1187
00:47:06.093 --> 00:47:06.695
I would never do that.

1188
00:47:06.761 --> 00:47:07.995
Okay.

1189
00:47:08.062 --> 00:47:10.898
I'm, I'm, I was uh, I
was getting coconuts.

1190
00:47:10.964 --> 00:47:12.266
Your favorite.

1191
00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:13.334
Babe!

1192
00:47:13.434 --> 00:47:15.069
Hey, where you going?

1193
00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:16.070
Babe!

1194
00:47:16.136 --> 00:47:19.541
Whoa, whoa, you feel that?

1195
00:47:19.607 --> 00:47:21.643
Whoa, you feel that?

1196
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.310
It's an earthquake, babe!

1197
00:47:23.377 --> 00:47:25.647
- She, she's gone, buddy.
(Shepley mumbles)

1198
00:47:25.714 --> 00:47:27.314
- Whoa, Mommy!
- You aced it.

1199
00:47:28.248 --> 00:47:29.651
- Thanks for everything today

1200
00:47:29.718 --> 00:47:31.586
and for making sure
I got home safe.

1201
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.188
- Look, I know you
have a lot on your mind

1202
00:47:34.254 --> 00:47:39.026
and Travis has a interesting
way of expressing himself,

1203
00:47:39.126 --> 00:47:40.327
but something tells me

1204
00:47:40.394 --> 00:47:42.597
that this marriage is
worth fighting for.

1205
00:47:43.598 --> 00:47:45.032
And I know I'm not ordained yet,

1206
00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:46.967
but if you and Travis ever
want to talk anything through,

1207
00:47:47.034 --> 00:47:48.102
I'm here to listen.

1208
00:47:49.738 --> 00:47:51.939
And I won't splash
you with holy water.

1209
00:47:52.005 --> 00:47:53.941
- (chuckles) Thanks.

1210
00:47:54.375 --> 00:47:55.376
- Bye.

1211
00:47:55.476 --> 00:47:56.210
- Bye.

1212
00:47:58.613 --> 00:48:01.148
(Abby sighs)

1213
00:48:02.049 --> 00:48:07.354
(water gurgling)
(gentle acoustic music)

1214
00:48:15.496 --> 00:48:16.865
- Hi.
- Hi.

1215
00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:18.232
(Abby chuckles)

1216
00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:19.433
- [Travis] It's the first
time we've been in sync

1217
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.434
for a while.

1218
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:21.368
- Yeah.

1219
00:48:23.772 --> 00:48:26.106
- I'm sorry I've
been such a dick.

1220
00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:27.542
- I mean, you haven't.

1221
00:48:27.642 --> 00:48:28.576
It's...

1222
00:48:28.643 --> 00:48:29.376
- I really have.

1223
00:48:31.044 --> 00:48:32.112
We know I have.

1224
00:48:32.781 --> 00:48:34.948
- You have. (laughs)

1225
00:48:35.048 --> 00:48:36.116
Well, thank you.

1226
00:48:36.785 --> 00:48:37.886
I appreciate that.

1227
00:48:37.951 --> 00:48:39.119
It...

1228
00:48:40.354 --> 00:48:42.222
Look, I mean, I have
a really bad habit

1229
00:48:42.322 --> 00:48:43.558
of running away
from my problems.

1230
00:48:43.658 --> 00:48:44.458
- You do.

1231
00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:45.760
- I do.

1232
00:48:45.827 --> 00:48:48.262
And I really don't
wanna run away from you.

1233
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:53.267
Maybe we just need a
little bit of a break.

1234
00:48:54.803 --> 00:48:56.571
Our whole relationship
has just been

1235
00:48:56.671 --> 00:48:58.840
this crazy pressure cooker

1236
00:48:58.939 --> 00:49:00.775
and neither of us have
been able to go off

1237
00:49:00.842 --> 00:49:03.143
and have any fun or
blow off any steam.

1238
00:49:06.213 --> 00:49:07.615
- I have fun with you.

1239
00:49:07.682 --> 00:49:09.316
(both laughing)

1240
00:49:09.383 --> 00:49:12.219
- I know, but I, I
met independently.

1241
00:49:12.286 --> 00:49:13.153
- Yeah.

1242
00:49:14.087 --> 00:49:16.558
I have always wanted
a bachelor party.

1243
00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:18.292
- Okay.

1244
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.128
Let's do it.

1245
00:49:21.195 --> 00:49:22.429
I mean, there's no
time like the present.

1246
00:49:25.867 --> 00:49:27.569
- I like your thinking, Abby.

1247
00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:31.739
Hey bro, get all the
boys together and
come down to Mexico.

1248
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.542
Oh, by the way, we got married.

1249
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:35.844
Abby, dipshit.

1250
00:49:36.678 --> 00:49:39.046
- [Narrator] Always
ready for a good time,

1251
00:49:39.112 --> 00:49:42.449
the Maddox brothers
flew down to Gatito.

1252
00:49:43.618 --> 00:49:44.384
- Yeah, Dad.

1253
00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:45.285
Yeah.

1254
00:49:45.352 --> 00:49:45.954
Yeah.

1255
00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:47.187
Talk soon.

1256
00:49:47.254 --> 00:49:48.790
- [Tyler] What'd he say?

1257
00:49:48.857 --> 00:49:50.224
- That I'm in charge.

1258
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.727
And to make sure you
don't do anything stupid.

1259
00:49:56.997 --> 00:49:59.066
- It says that El Jefe
had kilos of cocaine

1260
00:49:59.132 --> 00:50:02.637
that was eaten by a clowder
of hairless Mexican cats.

1261
00:50:02.704 --> 00:50:04.806
I swear if you ruin
Travis's bachelor party

1262
00:50:04.873 --> 00:50:06.373
with a cocaine cat
scavenger hunt,

1263
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.041
I will sell you
to a local cartel

1264
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:10.043
and they will use
you as a drug mule.

1265
00:50:10.143 --> 00:50:14.816
- [Trenton] Ow!

1266
00:50:14.883 --> 00:50:16.651
- Oh, look, I'm sorry.

1267
00:50:16.718 --> 00:50:17.919
I'm sorry.

1268
00:50:17.986 --> 00:50:19.453
I don't know how many
times I can say it.

1269
00:50:19.521 --> 00:50:21.556
There's a first class ticket
away waiting for you at Delta.

1270
00:50:21.623 --> 00:50:22.757
I booked us a suite.

1271
00:50:22.824 --> 00:50:24.826
I just gotta get this money
and a couple of fingers

1272
00:50:24.893 --> 00:50:26.828
and then it's just us.

1273
00:50:26.895 --> 00:50:28.061
All right?

1274
00:50:28.128 --> 00:50:29.029
There will be no talk
of work, I swear.

1275
00:50:29.096 --> 00:50:31.098
Just massages and margaritas.

1276
00:50:32.165 --> 00:50:33.133
Oh, Darius.

1277
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.703
Just come down, please.

1278
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.437
Call me back.

1279
00:50:37.505 --> 00:50:40.107
(lively music)

1280
00:50:41.308 --> 00:50:46.814
- Don't you ever, every
do that again, you...

1281
00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:47.849
- Hey.

1282
00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:48.650
Oh hey, babe.

1283
00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:49.617
Hey, how are you?

1284
00:50:49.684 --> 00:50:50.852
Oh where were you last night?

1285
00:50:50.919 --> 00:50:51.986
- Oh yeah, why'd you spy me?

1286
00:50:52.052 --> 00:50:52.887
- Spy?

1287
00:50:52.987 --> 00:50:53.855
What are you talking about?

1288
00:50:53.922 --> 00:50:54.856
What are you talking about?

1289
00:50:54.923 --> 00:50:55.757
- So we're, everything's fine?

1290
00:50:55.823 --> 00:50:56.891
- Yes, everything's fine.

1291
00:50:56.958 --> 00:50:57.725
- Oh perfect.
- So there's nothing

1292
00:50:57.792 --> 00:50:58.458
to talk about.

1293
00:50:58.526 --> 00:51:01.029
(Shepley groans)

1294
00:51:01.094 --> 00:51:02.730
- Oh, that hurt.

1295
00:51:02.797 --> 00:51:04.131
Oh, babe!

1296
00:51:04.699 --> 00:51:05.867
Why did you do that?

1297
00:51:05.934 --> 00:51:06.834
- Hey, you holding
out on us, cuz?

1298
00:51:06.935 --> 00:51:07.869
- Hey, guys.

1299
00:51:07.936 --> 00:51:09.102
Welcome to Mexico.

1300
00:51:09.169 --> 00:51:10.270
- Keeping the riches
to yourself, huh?

1301
00:51:10.337 --> 00:51:12.006
- Yeah, you're a
fucking dead man, right?

1302
00:51:12.072 --> 00:51:13.273
- What?

1303
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.008
- [Trenton] Does this
place have a bidet?

1304
00:51:14.074 --> 00:51:14.676
- Fucking nerd.

1305
00:51:14.742 --> 00:51:15.543
- What?

1306
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.511
It was a long flight.

1307
00:51:16.578 --> 00:51:17.311
They're completely
normal in Europe.

1308
00:51:17.377 --> 00:51:17.979
No.

1309
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:18.713
Don't chuck me in the ocean.

1310
00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:20.648
- [Travis] Hey, buddy.

1311
00:51:20.715 --> 00:51:21.516
- [Abby] Hi.

1312
00:51:21.583 --> 00:51:22.750
- Hey, hey, guys.

1313
00:51:22.817 --> 00:51:24.151
- Change of plans.

1314
00:51:24.217 --> 00:51:25.887
So the girls' spa treatment
is now in the afternoon.

1315
00:51:25.954 --> 00:51:27.120
- Oh yeah.

1316
00:51:27.187 --> 00:51:28.388
- So they're going
to the beach with us.

1317
00:51:28.455 --> 00:51:29.757
- Will you teach me
how to play football?

1318
00:51:29.824 --> 00:51:30.692
I've never played football.
- Hey Shep, think fast.

1319
00:51:30.758 --> 00:51:31.659
(Shepley groans)

1320
00:51:31.726 --> 00:51:32.527
Heads up, buddy.

1321
00:51:32.594 --> 00:51:33.795

Okay baby, what's going on?

1370
00:53:20.868 --> 00:53:23.137
Seriously, you're,
you're acting so weird.

1371
00:53:23.203 --> 00:53:25.907
I mean, you you literally
build a wall between us.

1372
00:53:25.973 --> 00:53:26.708
- Okay, you...

1373
00:53:27.909 --> 00:53:29.409
You know when you're driving
down the highway and,

1374
00:53:29.476 --> 00:53:31.012
and a really great song comes on

1375
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:32.747
and and you get
really into the song

1376
00:53:32.814 --> 00:53:34.015
and then you miss your exit.

1377
00:53:34.082 --> 00:53:34.982
And then-
- Okay, wait, wait.

1378
00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:36.818
Am I the song or the highway?

1379
00:53:36.884 --> 00:53:39.020
- No, it's just, I
feel like I'm learning

1380
00:53:39.087 --> 00:53:40.220
all of these things about you.

1381
00:53:40.287 --> 00:53:41.522
- Good, good, good.

1382
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:43.624
You should be, you know,
learning things about me

1383
00:53:43.691 --> 00:53:44.792
and me learning
things about you.

1384
00:53:44.859 --> 00:53:45.459
Yeah.

1385
00:53:45.526 --> 00:53:46.460
- Yeah, no, definitely.

1386
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.261
Then I find out that you hunt.

1387
00:53:48.328 --> 00:53:49.130
- I hunt.

1388
00:53:49.197 --> 00:53:50.263
Yeah, I'm not hiding it.

1389
00:53:50.363 --> 00:53:51.431
- No, you're not
listening to me.

1390
00:53:51.498 --> 00:53:52.667
- You're not listening to me.

1391
00:53:52.767 --> 00:53:54.569
- Okay, maybe I shouldn't
have even tried.

1392
00:53:54.635 --> 00:53:56.571
- Yeah, maybe you
shouldn't have.

1393
00:53:58.973 --> 00:54:00.074
- [Narrator] And so the boys

1394
00:54:00.141 --> 00:54:02.309
and girls went
their separate ways.

1395
00:54:02.375 --> 00:54:05.780
The girls went off
to a relaxing spa

1396
00:54:05.847 --> 00:54:08.216
and the boys, well...

1397
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:09.282
(lively music)

1398
00:54:09.382 --> 00:54:11.719
(crowd cheers)

1399
00:54:19.026 --> 00:54:19.827
(Tyler spits)

1400
00:54:19.894 --> 00:54:20.695
- Let's go!

1401
00:54:20.762 --> 00:54:21.662
Let's go!

1402
00:54:21.729 --> 00:54:22.530
More!

1403
00:54:22.597 --> 00:54:23.363
More!

1404
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:24.232
Don't be a bitch!

1405
00:54:24.297 --> 00:54:24.966
Come on.

1406
00:54:25.032 --> 00:54:25.800
(Taylor spits)

1407
00:54:25.867 --> 00:54:27.068
(Trenton spits)

1408
00:54:27.135 --> 00:54:28.736
- Ah, what the fuck!

1409
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:30.738
- Come on, let's go.

1410
00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:31.806
Let's go, bitch
- Shut up, bitch.

1411
00:54:31.873 --> 00:54:32.673
Shut up!

1412
00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.340
- Come on!

1413
00:54:33.406 --> 00:54:35.810
(crowd cheers)

1414
00:54:35.877 --> 00:54:36.944
(Tyler spits)

1415
00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:39.981
(Trenton spits)

1416
00:54:40.047 --> 00:54:41.281
- Geez, my skin feel like silk.

1417
00:54:41.348 --> 00:54:42.650
- Yeah, we should try
the seaweed wrap next.

1418
00:54:42.717 --> 00:54:43.985
- Ooh, I would love
to do a seaweed wrap.

1419
00:54:44.051 --> 00:54:44.852
I've always wanted to.

1420
00:54:44.919 --> 00:54:45.920
- [America] Yeah.

1421
00:54:45.987 --> 00:54:48.055
- Okay, well, at least
come with us to dinner.

1422
00:54:49.157 --> 00:54:51.025
No, nobody's going
to bother you.

1423
00:54:51.926 --> 00:54:52.827
(scoffs) You know what?

1424
00:54:52.894 --> 00:54:54.061
Okay, do whatever you want,

1425
00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:56.798
but tomorrow we
are going sailing.

1426
00:54:56.898 --> 00:54:59.066
(Vivian groans)

1427
00:54:59.167 --> 00:54:59.934
(Vivian sighs)

1428
00:55:00.034 --> 00:55:00.802
I'm sorry about that.

1429
00:55:00.902 --> 00:55:01.803
- No, you're fine.

1430
00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:04.071
Sounds like you need
some relaxation.

1431
00:55:04.172 --> 00:55:05.740
- What brings you
girls down here?

1432
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:07.542
- Honeymoon.

1433
00:55:07.642 --> 00:55:08.643
- Oh!

1434
00:55:09.442 --> 00:55:12.379
I once had a one night
stand with my doula.

1435
00:55:14.048 --> 00:55:15.382
- Oh, no, no, no.

1436
00:55:15.448 --> 00:55:16.984
It's not, no.
- No, not us, not us.

1437
00:55:17.051 --> 00:55:17.952
- Not that they're, no.

1438
00:55:18.052 --> 00:55:18.753
Great for you though.

1439
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:19.520
No, but...

1440
00:55:19.587 --> 00:55:20.721
- We don't, we don't have

1441
00:55:20.788 --> 00:55:21.656
a problem with that.
- No, it's great.

1442
00:55:21.722 --> 00:55:22.590
- We love that.

1443
00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.490
We support that.
- It's her honeymoon.

1444
00:55:23.558 --> 00:55:24.391
- It's just not us.

1445
00:55:24.457 --> 00:55:25.827
- Yeah (chuckles).

1446
00:55:25.893 --> 00:55:27.128
- Yeah, it's our bachelor
and bachelorette parties.

1447
00:55:27.195 --> 00:55:28.361
We're doing it
kind of backwards.

1448
00:55:28.428 --> 00:55:29.997
- Well, where's the
rest of your party?

1449
00:55:30.064 --> 00:55:31.599
- Yeah, you're looking at it?

1450
00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:32.667
- Yeah.

1451
00:55:32.733 --> 00:55:35.102
- Well, is that what you wanted?

1452
00:55:36.469 --> 00:55:38.739
- Well, no.

1453
00:55:38.806 --> 00:55:39.774
- Oh, okay.

1454
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:41.441
It's what he wanted.

1455
00:55:41.509 --> 00:55:42.677
Okay.
- Yeah, I guess

1456
00:55:42.743 --> 00:55:43.811
I'm just trying
to make him happy.

1457
00:55:44.344 --> 00:55:45.412
Oh God.

1458
00:55:45.478 --> 00:55:46.314
Oh no, I heard it.

1459
00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:47.347
That was awful.

1460
00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:49.416
I know.
- Hey, hey, hey, you.

1461
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:50.551
Put that down.

1462
00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:51.919
- [Yan] Hey, I can't.

1463
00:55:51.986 --> 00:55:52.587
- Ah, ah.
- I can't.

1464
00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:53.888
- [Vivian] Put it down.

1465
00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:55.122
- Hey, you need to behave.

1466
00:55:55.223 --> 00:55:57.424
- Oh, are you gonna teach me?

1467
00:55:58.491 --> 00:56:00.895
(Yan grunts)

1468
00:56:00.962 --> 00:56:02.029
- [Yan] Ow!

1469
00:56:02.096 --> 00:56:03.030
(Vivian chuckles)

1470
00:56:03.097 --> 00:56:04.298
- Oh my God, you're my hero.

1471
00:56:04.364 --> 00:56:06.033
- [Vivian] Pour
yourselves a drink, girls.

1472
00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.434
- Okay.

1473
00:56:08.002 --> 00:56:09.170
- Can I be frank?

1474
00:56:09.237 --> 00:56:10.571
- Please.
- Please.

1475
00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:13.841
- This marriage is starting
off on the wrong foot.

1476
00:56:13.908 --> 00:56:17.812
This is not about his needs,
it's about your needs.

1477
00:56:17.912 --> 00:56:19.914
Now, I lead women's
retreats throughout the year

1478
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:22.183
and it's mostly Fortune 500,

1479
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.185
but I also cater
to the homemaker

1480
00:56:24.252 --> 00:56:26.453
and poor people like yourself.

1481
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.456
Because as much as you would
like to deny it, girls,

1482
00:56:29.523 --> 00:56:33.861
you cannot disrespect or
demean the power of the pussy.

1483
00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:36.496
Drink.

1484
00:56:36.564 --> 00:56:37.765
Drink, drink.

1485
00:56:37.832 --> 00:56:41.669
Drink it, it's expensive.
- Oh.

1486
00:56:41.736 --> 00:56:42.737
- Ladies.

1487
00:56:42.803 --> 00:56:45.206
These two will be joining us.

1488
00:56:45.273 --> 00:56:46.607
I have some calls to make,

1489
00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:48.943
but Fernando knows where
to take you, so run along.

1490
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:50.044
I'll see you later.

1491
00:56:50.278 --> 00:56:55.482
(rooster croaks)
(triumphant music)

1492
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:58.319
- We don't see
this in the States.

1493
00:56:58.418 --> 00:57:00.354
- Yeah, that's
because it's illegal.

1494
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.823

1495
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.258

- Yeah, yeah.

your advice right now.

- Okay, okay, um.

1607
01:01:14.074 --> 01:01:16.210
Well she's favoring
her right knee.

1608
01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:16.844
Go for her knee.

1609
01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.179
- No, that's so mean.

1610
01:01:18.245 --> 01:01:20.481

it might save your life.

- Don't listen to her.

1614
01:01:24.553 --> 01:01:25.219
She's trying to
get in your head.

1615
01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:26.220
Look at me.

1616
01:01:26.287 --> 01:01:27.755

1617
01:01:30.424 --> 01:01:31.492

1618
01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.893
- Nothing.

1619
01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:37.231
- She's trying to fuck you.

1620
01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:38.600

1621
01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:40.201

You know, um, I thought I was

know what we mean.

- Away from Blondie.

1818
01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:09.289
- You mean Abby, my wife.

1819
01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.826
- Come on, we won't tell.

1820
01:08:12.994 --> 01:08:15.563
(purring)

1821
01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:21.035
- I gotta go.

1822
01:08:21.101 --> 01:08:22.837
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1823
01:08:25.974 --> 01:08:27.274
- Naughty, naughty.

1824
01:08:28.241 --> 01:08:30.778

us stay on the cot.

1825
01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:32.179
- Yeah, well.

1826
01:08:32.245 --> 01:08:34.949
Okay ladies, it's been real.

1827
01:08:35.016 --> 01:08:38.052
Good luck with your
life, your marriage.

1828
01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:40.454
And if you were a
gambler, I would tell you

1829
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:43.791
that the odds are not in
your favor and to fold.

1830
01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:44.692
- Wait, I have to pee.

1831
01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:45.893
Is this a bathroom?

But, no, no, no, no.

Don't, don't go there.

1835
01:08:48.362 --> 01:08:49.664
That's Parker's room.

1836

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:46.721
Fine, two can play at that.

Okay, I'm just.

1871

Okay, hi, Parker.

How are you sleeping?

1892
01:10:56.624 --> 01:10:57.357
Roll over!

1893
01:10:57.424 --> 01:10:59.794
God, you're fucking pointless.

1894
01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:00.728
Roll over!

1895
01:11:01.629 --> 01:11:03.631

So mean.

1917
01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:39.594
- [Phone Woman]
I'm sorry, Señor.

1918
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.295
There's no one
here by that name.

1919
01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:42.563
Or the other girls.

1920
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.565
Have you tried
calling the police?

1921
01:12:44.632 --> 01:12:46.267
- Yeah, I don't think
we're there yet.

1922
01:12:46.366 --> 01:12:47.702
Thank you though.

1941
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:16.691
It's Abby, it's me.

- Abby?

1943
01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:18.559
What are you doing here?

1944
01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:19.927
- I was just trying
to take a selfie.

1945
01:14:20.027 --> 01:14:20.493
- A selfie?

1946
01:14:20.561 --> 01:14:21.963
Fucking psycho.

(knocking on door)

1948
01:14:22.997 --> 01:14:23.864

01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:24.665
- Oh God.

1950
01:14:24.732 --> 01:14:25.933
He's gonna kill you.

1951
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.435
- [Travis] (knocking)
Abby, open up.

1952
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.103
- There's nobody here by
that name, so piss off.

1953
01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:30.271
- Shh!

1954

- Well?

1962
01:15:03.503 --> 01:15:05.239
How's that for your
first time, Miguel?

1963
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.241
Ain't she's something else?

1964
01:15:08.509 --> 01:15:11.145
Found her in bed with
her ex on our honeymoon.

1965
01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:17.051
- It was really stupid.

1966
01:15:17.118 --> 01:15:18.586
I was drunk

1967
01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:21.155
and trying to get a selfie
to make him jealous.

1968
01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:22.590
The only reason I did it is

1969
01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:25.426
because I went to
FaceTime Travis last night

1970
01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:27.995
and this is what I saw.

1971
01:15:31.399 --> 01:15:33.868
- I, Abby, I, I had nothing

1972
01:15:35.002 --> 01:15:35.603
to do with this.

1973
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:37.338
You have to believe me.

1974
01:15:37.405 --> 01:15:40.074
- I do.

1975
01:15:40.141 --> 01:15:41.208
I do.

1976
01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.676
When I sobered up this morning

1977
01:15:42.743 --> 01:15:45.012
and I had a second to think,
I figured that, I don't know,

1978
01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:48.082
that some girls must have
taken your phone or something.

1979
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:49.750
- And that's the truth,

1980
01:15:51.419 --> 01:15:53.888
- Right, I believe you.

1981
01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:56.290
- You guys, there's,
there's hope in this.

1982
01:15:57.591 --> 01:15:59.060
- Except that doesn't
really go both ways

1983
01:15:59.126 --> 01:16:01.095
in our relationship
now, does it?

1984
01:16:01.162 --> 01:16:03.230
(sad, slow music playing)

1985
01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:07.735
- (sighs) Well, it's not really

1986
01:16:07.835 --> 01:16:09.470
like you gave me
a fighting chance

1987
01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:11.305
with your marriage
annulment contest.

1988
01:16:13.607 --> 01:16:17.778
You set me up to fail.
(Abby sniffles)

1989
01:16:20.448 --> 01:16:21.516
- Miguel, I know that you said

1990
01:16:21.615 --> 01:16:23.384
that there's something
in Travis and I

1991
01:16:23.451 --> 01:16:24.852
that's worth fighting for,

1992
01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:28.789
but, you know, I don't really
think I have any fight left.

1993
01:16:31.358 --> 01:16:32.561
- Then neither do I.

1994
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.894
- (sniffles) I-

1995
01:16:33.961 --> 01:16:34.695
- Travis.

1996
01:16:35.596 --> 01:16:38.065
(footsteps)

1997
01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:41.669
- Abby, Psalm 51 says, create a-

1998
01:16:41.735 --> 01:16:43.704
- [Abby] Save it, I'm done.

1999
01:16:47.074 --> 01:16:49.810
(Miguel sighs)

2000
01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:54.348
(soft, sad music playing)

2001
01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:58.052
- [America] My mom
knows someone at customs

2002
01:16:58.119 --> 01:17:00.555
who can get us on a four o'clock
flight back to Sacramento.

2003
01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:01.822
- Thanks.

2004
01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:04.024
But I think I'm just
gonna hang around here.

2005
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:05.292
Wander.

2006
01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:06.861
- Don't wander too far.

2007
01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:08.996
Promise?

2008
01:17:09.096 --> 01:17:09.697
- Yes.

2009
01:17:09.763 --> 01:17:11.699
Yes, I promise, Mare.

2010
01:17:11.765 --> 01:17:13.535
But enough about me.

2011
01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:15.269
How are you doing?

2012
01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:16.837
- This is so weird, Abby.

2013
01:17:17.905 --> 01:17:19.106
The second I met Shepley,
I just fell so hard.

2014
01:17:19.206 --> 01:17:21.576
And we get here and I
feel like I'm just seeing

2015
01:17:21.642 --> 01:17:23.310
who he really is
for the first time.

2016
01:17:23.377 --> 01:17:24.812
- Yeah, sounds familiar.

2017
01:17:24.912 --> 01:17:28.149
- I mean, he hunts,
he spies on me.

2018
01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:29.116
I just can't.

2019
01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:31.385
He's not right for me.

2020
01:17:34.255 --> 01:17:35.456
- I hear you.

2021
01:17:35.524 --> 01:17:37.958
I thought maybe
Travis was different,

2022
01:17:38.058 --> 01:17:40.761
but he's just like all
the men from my past.

2023
01:17:41.695 --> 01:17:43.164
I mean, I don't know
what to say, Mare.

2024
01:17:43.264 --> 01:17:44.398
I guess we were both just-

2025
01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:48.068
(Benny speaking indistinctly)

2026
01:17:48.135 --> 01:17:49.336
- Hello?

2027
01:17:49.403 --> 01:17:51.238
Abby?

2028
01:17:51.305 --> 01:17:54.808
(tense guitar music plays)

2029
01:17:55.943 --> 01:17:57.344
- [Benny} I want to see
the two of you in my office

2030
01:17:57.411 --> 01:17:58.647
in an hour,

2031
01:17:58.712 --> 01:18:01.282
and don't you even
think of skipping town.

2032
01:18:02.551 --> 01:18:05.352
This is about Travis
assuming your debt

2033
01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:07.821
by fighting against Chernobyl.

2034
01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:12.026
(tense music playing)

2035
01:18:14.428 --> 01:18:17.898
(heavy rain falling)

2036
01:18:19.568 --> 01:18:22.937
(tense music playing)

2037
01:18:35.749 --> 01:18:38.252
(gate creaking)

2038
01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:41.322
(tense music playing)

2039
01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:50.264
(Abby screaming)

2040
01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:51.398
(Thud)

2041
01:18:51.465 --> 01:18:54.703
(Benny and Abby groaning)

2042
01:18:54.768 --> 01:18:57.171
- Abby, it's not what you think!

2043
01:18:57.238 --> 01:19:00.407
(Benny shrieks)

2044
01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:01.676
- [Abby] I fucking hate you!

2045
01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:02.810
- [Benny] I don't hit women.

2046
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:05.045
- [Abby] (indistinct),
motherfucker.

2047
01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:08.215
You said you
wouldn't do anything!

2048
01:19:09.618 --> 01:19:10.784
- [Benny] God, you're firm.

2049
01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:13.722
- [Abby] I fucking
hate you, you maggot!

2050
01:19:13.787 --> 01:19:15.422
- [Benny] What
are you, hormonal?

2051
01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:16.558
- [Abby] Fuck you!

2052
01:19:16.625 --> 01:19:18.425
(tense, instrumental
music plays)

2053
01:19:18.492 --> 01:19:20.294
(knocking on door)

2054
01:19:20.361 --> 01:19:21.362
- Who is it?

2055
01:19:23.764 --> 01:19:25.199
(knocking on door)

2056
01:19:25.266 --> 01:19:26.267
- What?

2057
01:19:26.367 --> 01:19:27.868
What do you want?

2058
01:19:28.637 --> 01:19:31.872
(door slams open)

2059
01:19:34.308 --> 01:19:38.145
(birds chirping)
(soft music playing)

2060
01:19:38.212 --> 01:19:41.248
- I'm sorry about your painting.

2061
01:19:42.349 --> 01:19:45.986
- Sorry about fucking
up your life, ish.

2062
01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:50.991
- You didn't fuck up my life.

2063
01:19:51.058 --> 01:19:53.994
You fucked up my
relationship with my dad.

2064
01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:57.064
- Well, there were
some other things.

2065
01:19:57.131 --> 01:19:58.165
Toledo.

2066
01:19:58.265 --> 01:19:59.300
- Hmm.

2067
01:19:59.366 --> 01:20:03.538
- Toledo? Dude, I was 14.
- You were a cash-cow.

2068
01:20:04.104 --> 01:20:08.909
- You really did deserve
that rock to the head.

2069
01:20:09.544 --> 01:20:11.513
I'm sorry about...

2070
01:20:11.579 --> 01:20:12.146
- Darius?

2071
01:20:12.212 --> 01:20:13.213
- Yeah.

2072
01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:16.250
- I don't even know if
he ever really loved me.

2073
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.985
This painting was my
last-ditch effort,

2074
01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:20.187
'cause we were down,

2075
01:20:20.287 --> 01:20:21.422
doesn't matter.

2076
01:20:24.693 --> 01:20:25.926
- Well, for what it's worth,

2077
01:20:25.993 --> 01:20:28.295
it's not like my
relationship is any better.

2078
01:20:28.362 --> 01:20:31.398
I'm about to be
a divorcee at 19.

2079
01:20:31.465 --> 01:20:32.600
- What?
- Yeah.

2080
01:20:33.735 --> 01:20:35.537
- For somebody who
is so good at cards,

2081
01:20:35.603 --> 01:20:37.672
you are a real fuckin' idiot.

2082
01:20:37.739 --> 01:20:39.373
- Excuse me?
- Oh yeah, right.

2083
01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.742
Miss Wisdom, at 19.

2084
01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:43.143
You don't see what's staring
you right in the face!

2085
01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:44.478
Love! Abby!

2086
01:20:44.579 --> 01:20:45.647
Love!

2087
01:20:45.714 --> 01:20:46.548
Your guy! This guy!

2088
01:20:46.614 --> 01:20:47.682
The fighter, Travis!

2089
01:20:47.749 --> 01:20:49.617
And the passion you two have?

2090
01:20:49.718 --> 01:20:51.218
You think you can
buy that on Amazon?

2091
01:20:51.318 --> 01:20:52.052
You cannot.

2092
01:20:52.986 --> 01:20:54.756
I don't care if you're
19 or you're 90!

2093
01:20:54.855 --> 01:20:57.257
When that happens? Sha-bam!

2094
01:20:57.324 --> 01:21:00.427
(birds chirping)

2095
01:21:00.494 --> 01:21:01.830
- Sha-bam?

2096
01:21:01.895 --> 01:21:03.063
- Sha-bam!

2097
01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:07.535
- Sha-bam.

2098
01:21:07.602 --> 01:21:09.370
- fuckin'' sha-bam.

2099
01:21:10.504 --> 01:21:11.573
- What do you guys want?

2100
01:21:11.639 --> 01:21:12.906
- We want you to fight for her.

2101
01:21:13.006 --> 01:21:14.241
- You don't think I'm trying?

2102
01:21:14.308 --> 01:21:16.110
- Then, dude, try
fuckin' harder.

2103
01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:17.478
It's like Dad always said,

2104
01:21:17.545 --> 01:21:19.446
"Sometimes you have to
fight for both of you

2105
01:21:19.514 --> 01:21:20.447
when one of you gives up."

2106
01:21:20.548 --> 01:21:21.750
- That's right.

2107
01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:23.217
You fight and you fight,
and you keep fighting.

2108
01:21:23.283 --> 01:21:25.854
- 'Cause you're a Maddox and
that's what we do for love.

2109
01:21:25.919 --> 01:21:28.255
- Travis, do you love her?

2110
01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:31.358
- Of course I love her.

2111
01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:34.962
- Then go and get her, dude.

2112
01:21:35.797 --> 01:21:37.064
- I don't even
know where she is.

2113
01:21:37.131 --> 01:21:38.666
- I think she found you, bro.

01:21:38.767 --> 01:21:40.000

with a sign that reads:

our father got our mother.

2152
01:23:32.446 --> 01:23:37.552
She passed before Travis
really got to ever know her.

2153
01:23:37.619 --> 01:23:39.587
- But, it's special.

2154

And you're special.

2155

you very much.

2157

01:25:54.055 --> 01:25:55.389
I was at the spa

2210
01:25:55.455 --> 01:25:56.924
and I heard that someone
tried to free the roosters

2211
01:25:56.991 --> 01:25:58.593
but didn't realize that they're
actually trained killers-

2212

they were killers!

that might be you.

2214

and I shut down,

2222
01:26:12.073 --> 01:26:13.107
and I'm-
- No, no, stop, stop, stop!

2223
01:26:13.173 --> 01:26:14.374

- I'm, I'm sorry!
