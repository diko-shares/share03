1
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.580
It's going. It's going.

2
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.950
And it's gone.

3
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.310
Whatever.

4
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.810
Maybe we should take a break.

5
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.860
That's it. I can't take this anymore.

6
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.550
I can't. I give up.

7
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.990
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

8
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.690
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

9
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.730
...who always takes my nuts.

10
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.960
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...

11
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.870
...stupid tree.

12
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.510
- What's happening?
- Guys.

13
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.340
I think he made it angry.

14
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.380
I'm awake.

15
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.070
<i>I'm UP---</i>

16
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.910
...and I'm late.

17
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.420
Demo. Dave Seville.

18
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.100
Keys. Bag.

19
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.430
Pants.

20
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.580
I need pants. Pants are essential.

21
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.620
Claire.

22
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.980
- Dave.
- Hey.

23
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.020
How's it going?

24
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.150
I haven't seen you since...

25
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.020
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

26
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.350
So I guess it worked.

27
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.930
What a fun clay that was.

28
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.960
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.

29
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.760
- Same old Dave.
- Not following you.

30
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.930
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

31
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.250
...who can't handle?
a serious relationship.

32
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.770


33
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.380
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

34
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.440
Tomorrow night. My place.

35
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.480
<i>- 1...
- Great.?</i>

36
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.810
- No...
- You look good, Claire.

37
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.340
Where are we?

38
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.440
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

39
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.510
Where did the mountains go?

40
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.310
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

41
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.010
Dave.

42
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.180
- Ian.
- Hey, big guy.

43
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.290
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?

44
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.400
- No. They never let me past the lobby.
- What? I can't...

45
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.400
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

46
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.700
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

47
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.710
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

48
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.940
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.

49
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.550
Omelet station.

50
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.980
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?

51
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.380
How about a shot
of wheat grass juice?

52
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.780
Maybe later. Thanks.

53
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.980
Let's talk about your song, Dave.

54
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.920
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

55
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.150
...the original inspiration came to me...
- The song sucks, Dave.

56
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.890
- What?
- Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

57
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.300
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

58
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.630
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

59
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.110
- That is new.
- The next big thing.

60
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.770
Dave, we go way back, all right?

61
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.510
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.

62
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.420
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

63
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.120
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

64
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.990
"Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

65
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.960
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday."

66
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.460
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

67
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.870
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

68
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.240
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

69
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.940
Ever?

70
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.060
Excuse me.

71
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.690
Can I get some of that water?

72
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.760
We ran out.

73
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.590
Hey!

74
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.470
- Out of the way.
- Alvin...

75
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.610
...slow down.
- Move your butt, Theodore.

76
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.260


77
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.450
Last one to the door is roadkill.

78
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.050
I'm in.

79
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.650
What are these shiny things?

80
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.580
Theodore, we're leaving now.

81
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.490
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

82
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.100
Maniac!

83
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.230
Back to tree. Back to tree.

84
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.230
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

85
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.840
- Basket! Three o'clock.
- Which way is 3 o'clock?

86
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.910
- This way.
- Guys, wait for me.

87
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.440
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

88
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.100
- Jump. You've gotta really want it.
- I want it.

89
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.440
- I want it.
- I can't hang like this all clay.

90
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.640
Will you jump already?

91
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.410
Muffins.

92
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.880
Gross. Is this his house?

93
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.350
No. It's his garbage can.

94
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.030
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

95
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.740
As it came down to one...

96
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.670


97
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.100
As the boa moves in for the attack...

98
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.370
...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.

99
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.520
The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.

100
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.090
The mouse crashes
through the foliage.

101
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.780
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

102
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.690
Hello, gorgeous.

103
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.050
We've hit the mother lode.

104
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.290
- Tropical rain forest
where food is bountiful.

105
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.770
This is the greatest clay of my life.

106
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.700
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

107
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.140
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

108
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.780
Cannonball.

109
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.250
Quick. Hide.

110
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.390
Hurry, you guys.-

111
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.470
Did I put these here?

112
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.220
There you are. I got you.

113
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.090
He's been out for quite a while.

114
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.590
You guys, he's dead.

115
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.460
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

116
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.400
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...

117
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.630
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

118
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.040
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

119
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.910
I must be hearing things.

120
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.370
Oh, this is trippy.

121
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.750
Sir, are you all right?

122
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.050
Get back!

123
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.560
Squirrels can't talk.

124
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.390
Hey.

125
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.230
Watch it, genius.

126
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.920
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

127
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.430
Chipmunks can't talk either.

128
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.300
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

129
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.400
This is not happening.

130
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.100
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

131
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.470
So how's that working for you, Dave?

132
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.740
How do you know my name?

133
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.010
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

134
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.520
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

135
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.590
- You ever heard of a credit rating?
- What's this thing?

136
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.620
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing... Turn that off.

137
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.420
Sorry.

138
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.690
He fell out of the tree at birth.

139
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.990
Can all animals talk?

140
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.530
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.

141
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.870
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

142
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.530
Dave likes to wear

143
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.470
Dirty underwear with little hairs

144
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.440
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

145
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.680
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

146
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.180
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

147
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.680
- He's Alvin.
- The awesomest one.

148
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.690
And I'm Theodore.

149
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.480
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

150
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.180
But we talk.

151
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.490
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

152
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.000
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

153
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.640
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

154
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.200


155
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.350
Don't do this, Dave.

156
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.180
We can gnaw right through this door.

157
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.450
Hi.

158
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.860
Oh, were we disturbing you?

159
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.740
What, you guys can sing too?

160
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.100
That's not singing. This is singing.

161
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.260
This is amazing.

162
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.400
Here, everyone inside.

163
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.640
- There you go.
- Thank you.

164
00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.180
All right, here's the deal.

165
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.950
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.

166
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.120
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?

167
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.190
I can live with that.

168
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.460
What about TV privileges?

169
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.790
Okay, but not after 7.

170
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.000
- Eight.
- Done.

171
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.610
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

172
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.870
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

173
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.510
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.

174
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.480
Yeah, you're our only friend.

175
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.680
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

176
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.310
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

177
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.460
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

178
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.360
- Yup.
- And is that your music stuff outside?

179
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.120
Yup.

180
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.000
Oh, no!

181
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.330
Hurry back.

182
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.200
So, fellas...

183
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.150
...a|| we gotta do is
find the right song, rehearse...

184
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.700
- Hey, Dave.
- Simon.

185
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.930
My bad.

186
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.700
This is my sheet music.

187
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.340
Alvin.

188
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.880
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.

189
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.250
- Killjoy.
- Are you guys always like this?

190
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.050
We're kids, Dave.

191
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.690
Well, where are your parents?

192
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.020
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

193
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.720
Then they take off.

194
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.890
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.

195
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.530
- I am Robert the Robot.
- Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!

196
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.110
- It's after me.
- Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

197
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.940
- Sorry.
- It's a collectible.

198
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.680
- I got it for Christmas last year.
- Christmas! We love Christmas.

199
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.080
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.

200
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.120
But we want to.

201
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.890
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

202
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.460
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.

203
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.560
Yeah, maybe.

204
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.430
Look, I've had a long and weird clay,
so off to bed.

205
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.200
Come on.

206
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.330
We start work tomorrow.

207
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.410
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

208
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.910
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

209
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.710
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

210
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.780
I hope Christmas comes fast.

211
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.590
Me too.

212
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.140
Want a plane that loops the loop?

213
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.840
Loop.

214
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.700
Hoop.

215
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.140
Hula-Hoop.

216
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.130
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

217
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.810
What are you guys doing?

218
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.910


219
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.700
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

220
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.040
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

221
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.280
- Hey. Where did it go?
- Simon, this landed right in front of you.

222
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.150
You didn't see it?

223
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.560
How many fingers am I holding up?

224
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.250
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

225
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.290
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Hang on a second.

226
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.930
Six. Final answer is six.

227
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.760
Try these.

228
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.910
How's that?

229
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.150
Someone trashed your house.

230
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.810
It was clean
when I went to bed last night.

231
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.280
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

232
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.850
Wanna see what we colored?

233
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.780
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

234
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.820
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's...

235
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.300
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.

236
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.030
And we're not sharing.

237
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.670
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

238
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.810
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent...

239
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:08.410
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

240
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.960
Let's go. Let's get to work.

241
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.500
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

242
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.230
- I'll say we are.
- Yeah. Let's sing it now.

243
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.240
- Ready, Simon?
- Okay.

244
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.710
- Ready, Theodore?
- Okay.

245
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.740
Alvin?

246
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.370
Alvin?

247
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.210
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.

248
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.210
Alvin!

249
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.180
Okay!

250
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.690
Christmas, Christmastime is near

251
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.850
Time for toys and time for cheer

252
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.530
We've been good, but we can't last

253
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.370
Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast

254
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.600
Want a plane that loops the loop

255
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.010
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

256
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.780
We can't hardly stand the wait

257
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.920
Please, Christmas, don't be late

258
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.690
What?

259
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.230
Dave Seville's in the lobby.

260
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.230
He says he won't leave
without seeing you.

261
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.600
That loser again?

262
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.820
- Dave.
- Ian.

263
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.080
- Okay.
- I've got something for you.

264
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.920
- It's your next big thing.
- Dave.

265
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.890
Don't say anything.

266
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.580
What the?

267
00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.660
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.

268
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.320
They Sing-

269
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.340
No. They don't.

270
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.100
They do. Just give me a second.

271
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.270
Come on, guys.

272
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.950
Want a plane that loops the loop

273
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.750
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

274
00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.120
You know, Dave...

275
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.320
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

276
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.790
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.

277
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.990
And others would say,
"You know what's weirder than that?

278
00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.500
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

279
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.970
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

280
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.330
...who not only speak English
but can sing."

281
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.940
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

282
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.940
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

283
00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.620
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

284
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.380
...that I have a lunch to go to.

285
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.860
I've got a lunch to go to.

286
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.120
What was that?

287
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.030
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.

288
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.960
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

289
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.690
We're not performing monkeys.

290
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.730
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

291
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.000
Well, how's this?

292
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.330
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

293
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.170
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.

294
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.400
We're sorry, Dave.

295
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.640
Yeah, that helps.

296
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.480
Never mind. I'm late for work.

297
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:26.910
Can we go with you?

298
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.720
What, so you can mess that up too?

299
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.910
You're going home.

300
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.690
Can I stand in your lap and steer?

301
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.360
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

302
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.630
Never mind.

303
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.570
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.

304
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.570
But we're building the suspense.

305
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.840
- Here he is.
- Sorry I'm late.

306
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.680
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.

307
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.850
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.

308
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.060
Right, Good-able.

309
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.560
Okay, here's the pitch.

310
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.790
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

311
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.060
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.

312
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.270
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

313
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.100
Could she be flying a kite?

314
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.680
I like kites.

315
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.310
Good.

316
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.150
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

317
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.720
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

318
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.160
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

319
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.780


320
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.430
- But not too sad.
- Right.

321
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.730
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar...

322
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.930
It's my mum. Sorry.

323
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.570
- Hi, Mum.
- A little situation, Dave.

324
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.770
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

325
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.350
- Alvin.
- Dave, help!

326
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.950
- What?
- At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.

327
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.280
Just stay calm.

328
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.980
And there goes Theodore.

329
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.250
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

330
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.260
I absolutely understand but...
Sorry, Dave?

331
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.790
Quick question.

332
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.130
How do you feel about an indoor pool?

333
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.460
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.

334
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.000
Out on the street, capiche?

335
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.840
Mothers.

336
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.680
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

337
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.020
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

338
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.320
...but then I looked again.

339
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.990
The "size of Theodore's butt"?

340
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.960
Why don't we come back to that?

341
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.700
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

342
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.140
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.

343
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.800
"How smart Simon thinks he is"?

344
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.670
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

345
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.040
Who's Simon?

346
00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.210
- I didn't...
- Just move it along.

347
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.590
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.

348
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.770
Sounds good.

349
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:28.030


350
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.610
Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.

351
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.710
He got away. Well...

352
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.340
Guys. What's this about?

353
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.210
Obviously, Theodore's butt.

354
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.870
We told you we colored.

355
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:47.040
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

356
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.510
We didn't know.

357
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.950
- We're sorry, Dave.
- Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

358
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.260
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

359
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.230
Why are my clothes all over the place?

360
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.930
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

361
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.700
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just...?

362
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.870
It's a raisin, Dave.

363
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.570
Prove it.

364
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.440
Okay, you got me.

365
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.780
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

366
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.550
- Alvin?
- You owe me big time.

367
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.590
Alvin.

368
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.650
Come on. Come on.

369
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.230
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.

370
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.240
- Get out.
- I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

371
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.810
- Out.
- I'm taking a shower here.

372
00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.570
You know,
if I made a list of my worst clays ever...

373
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.980
...today would be at the top
of the list.

374
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.170
And it's still early.

375
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.410
Clam it, sudsy.

376
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.750
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

377
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:05.520
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

378
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.700
Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?

379
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.370
That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.

380
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.700
- Dinner.
- So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.

381
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.470
I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.

382
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.050
That's half an hour.

383
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.210
Who's Claire?

384
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.860
Claire is Dave's mate.

385
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.020


386
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.920
She's my ex-mate.

387
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.320
Okay. This is great.

388
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.330
Dave. Dave, relax.

389
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.200
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

390
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.240
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

391
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.310
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

392
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.310
- Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
- Like a family.

393
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.840
No. Not like a family.

394
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.070
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

395
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.950
Right.

396
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.740
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.

397
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.440
What's that smell?

398
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.480
It's your cologne.

399
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.710
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug?

400
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.540
We call it scenting the area.

401
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.880
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

402
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.110
The place looks great.

403
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.520
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.

404
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.090
Yeah, I see that.

405
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.190
- Those bread sticks smell great.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.530
So when's dinner?

407
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.930
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

408
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.070
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

409
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.400
Hold the phone, Dave.

410
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.600
- We can't have...
- No.

411
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.800
- Even if we...
- No.

412
00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.570
- We thought it...
- And no. Look, in the other room.

413
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.710
Jeez.

414
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.380
What a buzzkill, man.

415
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.910
- I never knew you could cook this well.
- It's all about slow roasting.

416
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.120
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

417
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.730
Well, I'm impressed.

418
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.090
- I've been seeing your photos.
- Yeah, it's going really great.

419
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.330
How about you, how's your job?

420
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.300
Great. Loving it.

421
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.010
How do you think it's going?

422
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.510
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.

423
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.170
Alvin. Dave said that...

424
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.950
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

425
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.350
And his assistant.

426
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.290
Get back here.

427
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.460
You know, this is nice.

428
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.830
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

429
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.970
No pressure. Nothing weird.

430
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.540
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

431
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.080
You were saying?

432
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.610
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

433
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:15.620
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

434
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.180
A date? No.

435
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.200
The wiring in my unit is shot.

436
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.360
You should get an electrician
to fix that.

437
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.700
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

438
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.970
Okay.

439
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:48.920
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

440
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.660
Hey.

441
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.030
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

442
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.330
- Breath check.
- Where's A|...?

443
00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.530
Dave, are you okay?

444
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.040
Everything's fine.

445
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.510
Why did you do that?

446
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.270
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

447
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.750
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

448
00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.920
I think I got something in my eye.

449
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.420
Here. Let me see.

450
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.450
Yeah. It looks really irritated.

451
00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.600
It's so red. What happened?

452
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.930
What was that?

453
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.400
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

454
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.870
- A rat?
- Probably nothing.

455
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.060
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

456
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.040
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.

457
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.750
- What?
- Claire.

458
00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.320
Dave? Dave?

459
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.550
- Tell her she completes you.
- What are you doing?

460
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.590
- You got it, Dave.
- Dave.

461
00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.780
Dave, let go.

462
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.990
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just...

463
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.230
I lost my job, Claire.

464
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.920
And I guess I just needed a hug.

465
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.260
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

466
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.640
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

467
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.740
No games. No fooling around.

468
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.450
- The truth?
- Please, I'm begging you.

469
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.850
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

470
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.100
- You know what?
- I'm not crazy, I swear.

471
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.990
You haven't changed at all.

472
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.870
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

473
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.350
Chipmunks.

474
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.180
You should've kissed her, Dave.

475
00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.440
She wanted you.

476
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.140
Alvin, you're not helping.

477
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.480
Don't give up, Dave.

478
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.120
Go away. Leave me alone.

479
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.490
Dave, would you like a cookie?

480
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.150
I said, leave me alone.

481
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.570
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

482
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.530
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

483
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.370
He really did have garlic breath.

484
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.060
Yeah, well-played, guys.

485
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.040
Idea.

486
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.410
Who has cab fare?

487
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.810
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

488
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:58.440
Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.

489
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.840
I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...

490
00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.380
...when I can barely manage
my own life.

491
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.950
You should go back to your real home
in the forest.

492
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.250
That's what's best for all of us.

493
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.720
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but...

494
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.380
Guys?

495
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.880
Simon, Theodore?

496
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.880
Guys?

497
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.360
Alvin?

498
00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.460
Alvin!

499
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.940
Simon?

500
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.570
Theodore?

501
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.170
Alvin?

502
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.870
Alvin.

503
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.990
Hello?

504
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.670
Hello?

505
00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.170
Kids.

506
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:46.550
Christmas, Christmastime is near

507
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.380
Time for toys and time for cheer

508
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.050
We can't hardly stand the wait

509
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.530
Please, Christmas, don't be late

510
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.730
Welcome to Jett Records.

511
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.810
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.

512
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.320
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.

513
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.180
Were you worried about us, Dave?

514
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.190
No. I just need to know, that's all.

515
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.690
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

516
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.260
I need to know, okay?

517
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.170
Alvin.

518
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.610
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

519
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.440
- Sorry.
- Kids, huh?

520
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.850
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

521
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.280
Three boys.

522
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.460
Well, some clays
are better than others.

523
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.220


524
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.120
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

525
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.500
Quick, hide.

526
00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.470
Guys, what's all this?

527
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.550
Toaster waffles.

528
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.270


529
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.310
- What?
- Well, in case you didn't notice...

530
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.950
...I don't have a job anymo...

531
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.460
MY Song?

532
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.830
- All right.
- Yeah.

533
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.970
- Hello?
- Hey, Dave.

534
00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.640
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

535
00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.970
- Ian?
- Tell me you've heard the song.

536
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.280
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

537
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.820
How did you...? When did...?

538
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:07.010
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

539
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.180
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.

540
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.700
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.

541
00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.360
It's crazy. I gotta go.

542
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.870
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

543
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.710
We owed you, Dave.

544
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.510
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

545
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.350
Soup's on.

546
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.730
Alvin.

547
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.880
So, what do you think?

548
00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.350
Cool.

549
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.550
A|| right.

550
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.060
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

551
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.830
No.

552
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.110
Dave...

553
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.620
...are you awake?

554
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:55.850
I am now.

555
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:57.360
I had a nightmare.

556
00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.420
Can I sleep with you?

557
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.470
You won't even know I'm here.

558
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:07.670
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

559
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.330
Oh, okay.

560
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.250
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

561
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:53.070
- Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.

562
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.480
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

563
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.710
On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up

564
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.010
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

565
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.520
Wake up, lazy bones.

566
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.160
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

567
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.660
- Up and at them.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

568
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.060
- I'm coming
- Come on, Dave.

569
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.260
Hurry up, Dad.

570
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.160
- Dad?
- Dave. I said Dave.

571
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.830
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

572
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.240
- You want to open mine first.
- Open mine first.

573
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.000
- No, Dave, mine is better.
- You guys got me presents?

574
00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.010
Of course.

575
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.050
All right. Simon?

576
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.390
Wow, it's a...

577
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.050
It's a paper-clip compass.

578
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.530
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

579
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.960
Me next.

580
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:41.690
Alvin.

581
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.070
- My wallet.
- Do you like it?

582
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.040
Really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

583
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.270
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.

584
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.710
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

585
00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.750
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

586
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.220
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
"To Dav."

587
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:11.390
Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore."

588
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.160
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?

589
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.860
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.

590
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.240
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

591
00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.080
I'm not your...

592
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.840
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

593
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.880
But you're like a clad.

594
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.490
Well, not really.

595
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.250
I mean, we're friends for sure.

596
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.520
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

597
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.030
- Make us sweaters.
- Feed us.

598
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.100
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

599
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.440
That's what friends do.

600
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.200
So who wants to open their presents?

601
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:00.600
- Is that a trick question? We do.
- Yeah.

602
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.610
- Presents.
- Oh, boy.

603
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.180
Presents. Presents. Presents.

604
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.340
I can't wait to open mine first.

605
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.810
Envelopes.

606
00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.850
They're savings bonds.

607
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.350
Cool.

608
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.390
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

609
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.430
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

610
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.700
- Alvin, manners.
- Thank you, Dave.

611
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.360
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

612
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.880
- Ian?
- Who wants presents?

613
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:38.010
- All right.
- Cool.

614
00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.340
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.

615
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.980
Bring them on in, fellas.

616
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.090
- Oh, yeah.
- Jackpot.

617
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.090


618
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.380
- Taking care of my boys.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

619
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.530
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

620
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.390
- Which one is mine?
- That big one is for me, I think.

621
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.690
What did you get them?

622
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.830
Savings bonds.

623
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.090
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

624
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.430
You're in luck.
Your uncle Ian came through.

625
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:05.470
- Cool.
- Uncle Ian?

626
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:08.430
Is... Is this for me?

627
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.100
No, it's for Simon.

628
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.710
- Theodore.
- Oh, boy.

629
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:18.020
- And Alvin.
- Thank you, Santa.

630
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.680
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

631
00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.380
Yeah, you're welcome.

632
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.890
And guess what, guys.

633
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.590
Uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.

634
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.790
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

635
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.300
The whole nine yards.

636
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.630
- Awesome.
- Sweet.

637
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:38.470
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.

638
00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.440
A|| right? Something funky and fresh.

639
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.880
- Peace. We out.
- Bye, Uncle Ian.

640
00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.040
- Merry Christmas.
- Now it really is Christmas.

641
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.650
Mayday, mayday-

642
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.250
This way, this way, this way.

643
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:56.980
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.

644
00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.920
It is a very special night tonight.

645
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:06.000
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

646
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.100
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

647
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.940
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...

648
00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:19.910
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

649
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.750
Yeah, in the place to be

650
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.320
Chipmunks on the M-I-C
"Witch Doctor"

651
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:29.080
Everybody, can they do it?

652
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.690
Can they do it?

653
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.920
Come on, people, let's get to it

654
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.150
Let's get to it

655
00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:38.030
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor

656
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.660
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

657
00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.330
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you

658
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.840
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too

659
00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:53.110
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do

660
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.770
He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.850

The wall a wall a bingbang

Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.490
To the ting to the tang
The wall a wall a bingbang

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.460
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wall a wall a bingbang

666
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.960
Yo, DJ, pump this Party!

667
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.070
Everybody, can they do it?

668
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.860
- Can they do it?
- Go! Go! Go!

669
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.700
Come on, people, let's get to it

670
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:18.360
Go! Go! Go!

671
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.240
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor

672
00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.810
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

673
00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.510
Alvin! Simon! Theodore!

674
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:32.310
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true

675
00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:36.020
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice

676
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.860
And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice

677
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.830
He said to me:

678
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.330
To the ting to the tang
The wall a wall a bingbang

679
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.370
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wall a wall a bingbang

680
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.570
You've been keeping love from me

681
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.680
- And that's not very smart
- Not very smart

682
00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:04.520
I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart

683
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:12.350
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say

684
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.120
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do

685
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.360
I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you

686
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.130
- Oh, baby, baby!
- Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

694
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.600
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.

695
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:06.580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.950
- You mind if I grab a few pics?
- Claire.

697
00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.220
- Not at all. Fire away.
- Great.

698
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:16.280
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

699
00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.430
- Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
- Hi.

700
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.960
- Hello.
- Hi, Claire.

701
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:24.620
You're hot.

702
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.590
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

703
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.100
So, Dave...

704
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.140
...I'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you...

705
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:38.470
That I was insane?

706
00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:40.840
I totally understand it.

707
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.210
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

708
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:49.350
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

709
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:50.620
You're like a family.

710
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.890
Don't say "family" in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

711
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:58.000
- Like, clear-the-room gas.
- Does not.

712
00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:59.830
He doesn't want a family.

713
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.900
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?

714
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.900
Don't take it personally, you guys.

715
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.810
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

716
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.710
Right, Dave?

717
00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.880
Claire.

718
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.550
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

719
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.520
Hey, what do you think of this?

720
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.360
- What is it?
- It's Alvin.

721
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:31.330
That looks nothing like Alvin.

722
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:35.030
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

723
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:38.040
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

724
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.740
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

725
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.020
- See? You love it. It's Spanish.
- You know what? That's just weird.

726
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:50.590
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

727
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:53.020


728
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:55.620
I mean, forget about the music.

729
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.560
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

730
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:03.360
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

731
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:06.530
Chipmunk Heat, something like that.
Chipmunk wine coolers.

732
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.140
- I mean...
- They're just kids.

733
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.570
No, they're rats.

734
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.040
And they could make us both
so much money...

735
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:17.940
...if you just let me work with them.
- I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

736
00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:23.450
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

737
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.590
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?

738
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.820
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

739
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.660
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.

740
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:45.930
Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.

741
00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:48.740
- Up top.
- What's up, player?

742
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:52.910
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

743
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.250
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.

744
00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.910
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

745
00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:02.650
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

746
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.190
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.

747
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.030
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

748
00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.330
Really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.

749
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:18.100
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

750
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:23.140
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.

751
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:25.940
- Is that a lot?
- Yes.

752
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.810
Another thing... I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

753
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.010
Look, behind your back,
Dave calls you...

754
00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.450
..."the rats."

755
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.860
- Rats?
- Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

756
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:44.900
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

757
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.700
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

758
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.900
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?

759
00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.440
- Oh, right.
- Ciao.

760
00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:02.140
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

761
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.880
Get a wheelchair. Move over!

762
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:09.850
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

763
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.160
Alvin.

764
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.760
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.

765
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.060
Hey, GUYS,
I have an idea for a new song.

766
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.770
Hey, Dave.

767
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:26.070
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.

768
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.900
We are.

769
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.780
- Who's that?
- Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

770
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.080
She's also a masseuse.

771
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.080
Come on, move over, road hog.

772
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.090
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.

773
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.460
- Where did you get that game?
- Uncle Ian.

774
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.570
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.

775
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.870
Okay, you know what?

776
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.800
That's enough.

777
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.870
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

778
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.410
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

779
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.710
Spit it out.

780
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.250
- Spit it out.
- No.

781
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.210
Jett Records.

782
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.780
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

783
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.560
Could you give us a minute?

784
00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:27.560
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

785
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:32.140
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're...

786
00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:35.280
Major rock stars.

787
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.350
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're...

788
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.180
Major rock stars.

789
00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:46.020
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

790
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.750
Well, Uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

791
00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:50.480
Okay, you know what?

792
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.990
He's not your uncle.

793
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.930
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

794
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.330
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

795
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.200
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

796
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:06.430
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

797
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.440
Oh, winter's for losers.

798
01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:12.100
Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

799
01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:16.280
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

800
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:20.050
- Kids, Dave, or rats?
- What?

801
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.020
Well, Uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

802
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:26.030
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love Uncle Ian so much...

803
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.360
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

804
01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.690
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

805
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.470
Dave?

806
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.810
Are you still mad at us?

807
01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.710
Dave?

808
01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.260
"Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but...

809
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:05.490
You should go back
to your real home in the forest."

810
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.500
I guess he really does want us to go.

811
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:22.220
I told you, Dave.

812
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:24.380
I never lose.

813
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:55.320
Boys, welcome to your new home.

814
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:05.220
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
- Yeah.

815
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.660
Can we play with all this stuff?

816
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.230
Sure, why not? It's your house.

817
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.770
So, what are the rules around here?

818
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.840
Oh, I do have one rule...

819
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:20.130
...that there are no rules!
- Cool.

820
01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:33.580
Four degrees elevation.

821
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.090
Six degrees azimuth.

822
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.250
Fire!

823
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.710
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

824
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.000
Don't make me laugh.

825
01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.670
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

826
01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:01.150
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

827
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:13.560
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

828
01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.760
Sneak attack.

829
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.200
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

830
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:23.800
I'm finished now. Simon.

831
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.000
- Hey, give me that.
- Let go, Alvin.

832
01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.270
Oh, come on.

833
01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:32.300
- You had a turn.
- Who says you get a turn?

834
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.710
Give me that.

835
01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:38.650
Simon!

836
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.090
- You got to try.
- Get your mangy paws off of it.

837
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:45.650
- Scram.
- I want it.

838
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.820
Alvin, you don't decide.

839
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:05.070
- Why didn't the airbags deploy?
- Theodore, don't go into the light.

840
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.070
- Let's do it again.
- Awesome.

841
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.190
- Playing hard?
- Oh, yes.

842
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.080


843
01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.120
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.

844
01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:20.630
Well, Dave says that touring is no life
for a kid.

845
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.530
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

846
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.690
- Yes.
- Which reminds me...

847
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.770
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.

848
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:35.210
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.

849
01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.280
Oh, my God, oh.

850
01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:40.440
These would be great
if I could see out of them.

851
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.480
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

852
01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.120
- Shotgun.
- Hit the road.

853
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:47.850
Alvin...

854
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.970
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

855
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:45.010
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.

856
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.310
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

857
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:53.350
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

858
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.550
Strong. Give me some booty.

859
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:58.960
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

860
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:10.730
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.

861
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.640
Cut.

862
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.970
Here we are.

863
01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.480
Okay? All right?

864
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:03.250
Hold it.

865
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.550
We're not clone.

866
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.020
- You tell me.
- Killing me.

867
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.250
- What do you want?
- You are killing me here.

868
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.300
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

869
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.400
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

870
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.370
- What button do you want me to push?
- Fine. I've got it.

871
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:22.370
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

872
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.140
I love toffee.

873
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:30.880
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a...
Like a super cool energy health drink...

874
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:37.850
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.

875
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.130
Enjoy.

876
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:44.460
That ought to keep them awake.

877
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:31.480
- Get munk'd
' GO! go! go

878
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:35.010
Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd

879
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.950
Hey, hey, hey

880
01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.380
Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats

881
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:43.120
Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats

882
01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:44.950
Come and get munk'd with the Munks

883
01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:48.860
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

884
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:53.730
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

885
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.870
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.

886
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.840
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

887
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.670
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

888
01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.510
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

889
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.710
It's all about today's edge.

890
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.080
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

891
01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.550
"Dave always said..."

892
01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.850
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

893
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.930
It's fun Uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

894
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.100
What are you...? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

895
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:30.200
- Taffy.
- Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

896
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:31.740
What do you do?

897
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.900
- Choreography.
- I don't know what "choreography" is.

898
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.670
- What is that?
- It's dance.

899
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:43.580
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, "I'm the dance guy..." Hello?

900
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.580
Who? Dave Seville.

901
01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.250
Name rings a bell. A dead...

902
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:51.720
...broken bell.

903
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:55.230
- Just let me talk to the guys.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

904
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.860
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

905
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.200
- That's not what happened.
- Denial.

906
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.770
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

907
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.470
You're taking them away
for six months?

908
01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.740
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

909
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.640
Twelve?

910
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.910
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

911
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:18.080
They're doing great.
They're loving life.

912
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.720
Living large.

913
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:23.050
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

914
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:26.250
- They're happy now.
- Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

915
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:27.490
Put them on the phone.

916
01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.130
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

917
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.270
Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.

918
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.670
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

919
01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.400
- We'll send you a postcard.
- Ian, you can't do this.

920
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:40.630
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

921
01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:43.780
- I'm gonna see them.
- Look, Dave, I'm... Wait.

922
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:45.070
- Ian?
- Yeah? What?

923
01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.270
- Ian.
- I can't...

924
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.510
Ian...

925
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.350
...was that Dave?

926
01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.420
Yes. Yes, it was.

927
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.260
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

928
01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.300
He's really, really happy. So... All right.

929
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:12.170
And is he coming to the show?

930
01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.670
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

931
01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:23.980
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

932
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.550
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?

933
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.120
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

934
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:32.520
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

935
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.390
I know a guy. Let me call my guy.
I'll get on that.

936
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:38.360
Hey, captain, come here.

937
01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:39.660
Listen.

938
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.360
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

939
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.740
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

940
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:49.810
- Got it? Okay.
- Got it.

941
01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.320
Uncle Ian?

942
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:15.200
- What are you doing here?
- Can I sleep with you?

943
01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:16.740
I had a nightmare.

944
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.440
Oh, you had a nightmare?

945
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:23.770
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

946
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:30.350
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

947
01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:35.680
And I had to coordinate 121
different radio and print interviews...

948
01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.220
...in five different languages.

949
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:41.260
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...

950
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:46.960
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

951
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.200
So is that a no?

952
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.660
Guys...

953
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:24.840
...I wanna go home.

954
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:27.340
What do you mean? You are home.

955
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:30.170
No, I mean, "home" home.

956
01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.400
You know, with Dave.

957
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.280
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

958
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:42.450
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

959
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:47.660
Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.

960
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:50.300
Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.

961
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:54.530
Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.

962
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.870
Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?

963
01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.530
It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...

964
01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:05.110
...the trio will make
their first stop tonight...

965
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:11.020
...on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.

966
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.680
That's it.

967
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:36.970
Okay.

968
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:44.810
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

969
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.580
- I'll cover for you.
- Thank you.

970
01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:51.560
Can we get Wardrobe
down here, please?

971
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:53.320
Well?

972
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.230
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

973
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.170
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

974
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.670
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

975
01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.280
They need a long rest.

976
01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.780
A long rest. Are you...? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.

977
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.380
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so...

978
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:18.350
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

979
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.420
Thank you so much. I will...
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.

980
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:23.790
Chipmunk fever, catch it.

981
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.790
Knock, knock.

982
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:31.630
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

983
01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.860
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

984
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.600
So you're gonna cancel the show?

985
01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:41.270
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

986
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.710
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

987
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.310
Isn't that like cheating?

988
01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.150
No, it's not like cheating. It's...
Cheating is wrong.

989
01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.620
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

990
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:58.730
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.

991
01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.620


992
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:07.170
- No.
- Guys, what other choice do we have?

993
01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:10.640
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

994
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:12.770
All right, guys, tighten up.

995
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:18.310
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

996
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.070
Love you.

997
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.460
You know you got it made

998
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:32.860
When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top

999
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.620
Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler

1000
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.130
Hey, gotta get that cream

1001
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.770
You know you got it made
When they send in a parade

1002
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.030
When you drop down
Write a check in town

1003
01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:47.970
All just for one day

1004
01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.700
Gotta get that cream

1005
01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:01.120
- Don't you know that's how they roll?
- Roll, roll, roll

1006
01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:06.890
Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?

1007
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.290
Baby, you know

1008
01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:12.530
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks

1009
01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.370
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.

1010
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.910
Sorry.

1011
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.870
Come on, here's Theodore

1012
01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:28.520
You're here to stay
When you're always getting paid

1013
01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.880


1014
01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.720
- Gotta live the dream
- Take it, Simon

1015
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.490
You're here to stay
When your honeys think you hit

1016
01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.720
'Cause we gots it
Everybody watch it

1017
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.700
I love it. You love it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.

1018
01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.570
Dave Seville.

1019
01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.240
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

1020
01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:59.070
You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.

1021
01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:01.220
- No, I don't think so.
- He's with me.

1022
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:04.540
He's my assistant.

1023
01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.780
Okay.

1024
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.350
Thanks, Claire.

1025
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.960
What's going on, Dave?
What are you...?

1026
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.960
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

1027
01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.360
Your boys.

1028
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.460
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.

1029
01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.870
It's a good weird, though.

1030
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:27.470
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you...

1031
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.770
- Dave, your boys. We should go.
- Right. Okay.

1032
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.820
How we roll

1033
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:39.450
How we roll

1034
01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:41.950
Come on, can you feel it?

1035
01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.390
- How we roll
- Yeah, yeah, come on

1036
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.820
If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.

1037
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.230
- You're press, remember?
- Thanks.

1038
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.270
Roll

1039
01:18:57.970 --> 01:18:59.770
- Let's go, pal.
- I'm a photographer.

1040
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.930
- I have a press pass.
- You're out of here.

1041
01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.080
Alvin! Alvin!

1042
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.080
Alvin!

1043
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:15.020
- Dave! He's here.
- It's Dave.

1044
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:23.490
What's going on?

1045
01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:25.330
Alvin, what are you doing?

1046
01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.330
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.

1047
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.840
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Me too.

1048
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:39.640
Come on, guys.

1049
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:42.240
Hey, Ian...

1050
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:46.150
...kiss my furry cheeks.

1051
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.620
Here, hold on to that.

1052
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:52.790
Top of the morning to you.

1053
01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:00.630
Get off my set.

1054
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.670
Are you ready to rock?

1055
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.230
Turn it up, girl.

1056
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:08.340
How we roll

1057
01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:13.040
How we roll

1058
01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:14.580
I feel fine.

1059
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.050
Alvin, Simon, Theodore!
Come on, guys, we're going home.

1060
01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.160
Move, move.

1061
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:26.480
Let's go.

1062
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:32.860
- Get them.
- Look out. Run.

1063
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:36.770
Hi.

1064
01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.200
Bye.

1065
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:42.240
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

1066
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:45.940
Miss a chipmunk because you're slow

1067
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.780
Watch your knees.

1068
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:53.280
- Sorry.
- Come on, big fella. Come on. Come on.

1069
01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.290
A little bit closer.

1070
01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:58.450
Come on, right there. Perfect.

1071
01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.050
He'll feel that in the morning.

1072
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:06.700
- Guys.
- Dave!

1073
01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.200
You're not going anywhere.

1074
01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.900
What are you doing?

1075
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:14.470
- Put us down.
- Let me go.

1076
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.470
- Hey.
- You better study your French.

1077
01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:20.080
- You're going to Paris tonight. Okay?
- Let go. Just had my tail redone.

1078
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.810
- No, wait.
- Put it with my stuff.

1079
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.780
- Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
- No.

1080
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:27.920
What? Ian, they don't want this anymore.
Just let them go.

1081
01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.890
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

1082
01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.650
Come back.

1083
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.800
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

1084
01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:42.400
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

1085
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:46.130
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

1086
01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:52.150
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
People will come.

1087
01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.350
Guys, with me.

1088
01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.300
Roll, that's how we roll

1089
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:09.760
You'll never take us alive.

1090
01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.370
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

1091
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:14.370


1092
01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.630
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

1093
01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:33.650
Go, go, go. Go.

1094
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:44.830
Come on.

1095
01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.210
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

1096
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:06.850
How did you guys?

1097
01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.510
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

1098
01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:13.320
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

1099
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.360
You came back for us.

1100
01:23:16.670 --> 01:23:20.100
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

1101
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.260
Holy nuts.

1102
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.200
- What?
- Am I going crazy?

1103
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:26.970
Or did he just say "family"?

1104
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:31.510
I know...

1105
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.120
...but I really missed you guys.

1106
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.270


1107
01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.220
Me too.

1108
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:47.390
- So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it.
- Yeah, too macho.

1109
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.390
Missed you too.

1110
01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:54.470
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

1111
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.730
I just said, I missed you too.

1112
01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:00.880
Whatever.
Who are you guys to Judge me?

1113
01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.270


1114
01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:08.750
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

1115
01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.080
That's right. I love you, Dave.

1116
01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.780
Come here.

1117
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:21.620
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

1118
01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:24.460
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.

1119
01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:28.160
- I want to work the windshield wipers.
- Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

1120
01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.570
Have at it, fellas.

1121
01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:34.470
- I'm a good beeper.
- Save some horn for the rest of us.

1122
01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.770
- Come on, Dave, drive faster.
- Not with you steering.

1123
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:40.110
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

1124
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.270
- Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
- Enough of what? Of being awesome?

1125
01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:44.780
Alvin, I said that's enough.

1126
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:47.480
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

1127
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:55.120
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me "Uncle |an" again.

1128
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.860
Deal?

1129
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:23.650
No!

1130
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:32.390
Claire.

1131
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.660
- Hey.
- Come on in.

1132
01:25:35.670 --> 01:25:38.040
- Hi, Claire.
- Well, hello, Clarina.

1133
01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:40.200
- Hi, guys.
- Hope you like toaster waffles.

1134
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:44.510
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.

1135
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:48.510
Stupid cork. Doesn't...

1136
01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:57.120
I'm not gonna say it.

1137
01:25:58.690 --> 01:25:59.750
Good grief.

1138
01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.520
Are you still not gonna say it?

1139
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.860
Nope.

1140
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:15.100
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!

1141
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.140
Okay!

1142
01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.260
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.

1143
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:36.060
Here we go, and sing.

1144
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:41.030
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.

1145
01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.800
Why...? Why won't you sing?

1146
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:46.370
You know, I said, sing.

1147
01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.570
Sing.
