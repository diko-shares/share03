00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:44.712
<i>The future...</i>

2
00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:47.173
<i>The polar ice caps have melted,</i>

3
00:00:47.257 --> 00:00:49.342
<i>covering the earth with water.</i>

4
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.472
<i>Those who survived have adapted</i>

5
00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:56.349
<i>to a new world.</i>

6
00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:27.662
Bad luck, English.

7
00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:32.959
But the Slavers are producing
a good grade of poxy these days.

8
00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:37.129
Cost you a handful of dirt
or maybe that wind chime.

9
00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:40.508
- What are you doing here?
- Just waiting.

10
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.594
Take your hand off the sail.

11
00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:45.263
Take it off!

12
00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:50.184
I've seen your boat before.
Haven't seen you.

13
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.228
Took it legal.

14
00:05:53.563 --> 00:05:56.858
Previous owner was dead
on the tiller when I found it.

15
00:05:56.941 --> 00:05:59.861
You had another hour
before I traded up again.

16
00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:02.446
Just improving my means.

17
00:06:03.698 --> 00:06:06.367
- Well, I owe you then.
- No, thanks.

18
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.955
I got all the supplies I need.
Just came from an atoll.

19
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:14.584
Eight days east, if you're interested.

20
00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:19.046
Two Drifters meet,
something needs to be exchanged.

21
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.675
I know the code.
But I'll give you this one for free.

22
00:06:24.594 --> 00:06:26.637
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

23
00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:28.514
Yeah.

24
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.568
Smokers.

25
00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:44.030
Just enough wind to get away clean.

26
00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:49.911
Forget the bag.

27
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:57.793
It's not worth it.
You'll never make it with your sails down.

28
00:06:57.835 --> 00:06:59.045
Hey!

29
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.476
What can I say?

30
00:07:34.246 --> 00:07:35.873
Joe, he's going for it.

31
00:07:35.915 --> 00:07:37.625
What the hell?

32
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:44.882
Never seen that before.

33
00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:51.180
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

34
00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:58.187
Faster! Faster!

35
00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:22.461
Come on! He's gonna get it!
He's gonna get it!

36
00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.066
- Go!
- Get him! Get him!

37
00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:15.973
No! No!

38
00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:04.814
Inbound!
Straight out from the gates.

39
00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:15.866
English.

40
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:22.957
Flag's down, Drifter.
We got enough traders.

41
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.091
What does he have?

42
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:38.556
Dirt.

43
00:10:39.098 --> 00:10:40.850
Open the gates!

44
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:28.189
Bones to berries. Veins to vine.

45
00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:32.109
These tendons to trees.
This blood to brine.

46
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:34.236
Too old she was.

47
00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:38.782
This woman does leave us,
recycled and enshrined

48
00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:41.535
in the presence of him who leads us.

49
00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:02.806
What is that?

50
00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.064
You know me?

51
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:12.816
I know what you are.

52
00:12:12.983 --> 00:12:13.984
Good.

53
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.446
Then you know if you look
for trouble while you're here,

54
00:12:17.488 --> 00:12:19.782
you'll find more than you can handle.

55
00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:22.451
You got two hours.

56
00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.331
I'll only need one.

57
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:40.552
He's coming over here.

58
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.768
- Me.
- You each get one

59
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.229
if everything's here when I get back.

60
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.114
Pure dirt.

61
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.450
3.2 kilos.

62
00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:07.871
How'd you come by so much of it?

63
00:13:09.206 --> 00:13:11.709
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

64
00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.294
Where'd they get it?

65
00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:17.756
- They didn't say.
- We heard about that place,

66
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.591
that they was all killed.

67
00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.887
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

68
00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:26.432
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

69
00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:31.729
So what's the word?
We trading or not?

70
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.108
We'll tally it like pure hydro.

71
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.865
Works out to 62 chits.

72
00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:47.536
I want twice that.

73
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:53.167
I just want one sip of hydro!

74
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.252
No, not till you tell me.

75
00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:58.756
She got inkings on her back.
I seen her.

76
00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:02.259
They say if you read
the marks on the child,

77
00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:05.262
they'll lead you all the way to Dryland.

78
00:14:05.304 --> 00:14:08.557
- Dryland's a myth.
- Some still believe.

79
00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:11.894
They say the Smokers
even got an eye out for her.

80
00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:16.690
Well, then, we'd better
keep it to ourselves.

81
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:42.341
- Help you?
- Yeah.

82
00:14:43.384 --> 00:14:45.636
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

83
00:14:51.642 --> 00:14:53.143
You don't have much.

84
00:14:54.645 --> 00:14:56.397
You the man with the dirt?

85
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.291
Skoal.

86
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.839
- One more.
- Make it two.

87
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:25.092
A man this rich will buy
for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

88
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.428
One.

89
00:15:30.848 --> 00:15:34.017
That's an interesting
pair of boots you got.

90
00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:37.020
- Trade?
- No.

91
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.189
Shame.

92
00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:45.904
That's her.

93
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.365
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?

94
00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:50.033
No, you can't do that.

95
00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:52.703
I need another piece.
I want to draw some more.

96
00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:56.081
I'll give it to you.
Just stay in the back.

97
00:15:56.165 --> 00:15:58.876
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

98
00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.420
- Have you ever had a freshwater bath?
- Why are you talking to me?

99
00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:02.963
Just being friendly.

100
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.638
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

101
00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.599
You have a keen eye.

102
00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:15.809
Saw one in a picture. How much?

103
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.442
Half your chits.

104
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:37.539
- I'll take them, too.
- Take what?

105
00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.460
- You bought everything.
- I'll take them shelves.

106
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.382
So, what did you see
out there in your 15 months?

107
00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:50.636
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

108
00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.262
Asking the wrong person.

109
00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.597
Where did he come from?

110
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.474
- The one they buried today?
- Uh-huh.

111
00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:57.601
She found the only end there is.

112
00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:05.776
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

113
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.445
I'm not staying.

114
00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:12.533
We're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

115
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.703
We can look to our own
for impregnation,

116
00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:21.667
but too much of that sort
of thing gets undesirable.

117
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.794
When she's pregnant,

118
00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:26.922
you go on your way
with all the supplies you need.

119
00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:30.968
You don't have anything.
You're dying.

120
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:40.102
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

121
00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:45.732
- He's hiding something.
- Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

122
00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:00.414
When the elders say so,
you can leave, and not before.

123
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.560
Gills.

124
00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:24.980
Mutation!

125
00:18:25.022 --> 00:18:27.399
He's a mutant!

126
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.444
My hand!

127
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.960
Throw the nets!

128
00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.528
He's a murderer!

129
00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:21.495
By what right...

130
00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.832
You pay me to keep the peace.

131
00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.002
- This isn't it.
- No!

132
00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:32.255
- He has killed one of ours.
- He was defending himself.

133
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.799
He needs to be destroyed!

134
00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.301
- Kill him. Let's kill him.
- That may be,

135
00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.763
but not here and not like this.

136
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.422
What is it?

137
00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:15.298
Damn.

138
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.803
They're too tight. I can't get it off.

139
00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.891
Open the gate.

140
00:20:58.216 --> 00:20:59.676
Is it a map?

141
00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:03.680
You'd tell me if you knew,
wouldn't you, Enola?

142
00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.229
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

143
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:16.818
Helen, look.
Look at the prodigal child's latest vision.

144
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.743
How soon before we can leave?

145
00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:28.163
I don't have any idea yet
where we can go.

146
00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:31.416
I haven't figured out
the tattoo on her back.

147
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.919
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there.

148
00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.963
It's just beyond me.

149
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.760
Maybe he knows.

150
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:54.856
Yes, I see. They are webbed.

151
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:59.903
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

152
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:03.573
They tell me, too, that you have gills.
Isotropic gills.

153
00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:06.576
Are they merely vestigial
or are they functional?

154
00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:11.081
My name is Gregor.
I've just come to pay you a little...

155
00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:13.583
Oh, my God.

156
00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:19.589
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited.

157
00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.800
Your gills, they're functional.

158
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:25.262
<i>Ichthyus sapien</i>.
You can breathe in the water.

159
00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:27.138
How deep can you go?

160
00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:32.185
Look, I'm only here because
I want to learn more about you.

161
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.402
You don't like humans very much, do you?

162
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.446
I can't say that I blame you.

163
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:46.867
But tell me, are all of your kind
as bad-tempered as you are?

164
00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:53.331
- I have no kind.
- Oh, fish rot.

165
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:56.293
I'd be surprised if there weren't others,
and if there aren't,

166
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:58.128
there will be eventually.

167
00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:03.425
Anyway, I've come here because
I need to ask you a question.

168
00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:07.721
Where did your dirt come from?

169
00:23:07.804 --> 00:23:09.639
Is it from Dryland?

170
00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:11.975
Do you know what this is?

171
00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.521
The ancients, they did
something terrible, didn't they?

172
00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:20.358
To cause all this water.
Hundreds, hundreds of years ago.

173
00:23:20.442 --> 00:23:22.903
If I tell you, will you open this lock?

174
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.198
I haven't a key.

175
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:31.578
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

176
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:32.954
Good as any key.

177
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.623
A mooring cleat?

178
00:23:36.541 --> 00:23:39.336
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

179
00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.840
- I'll be right back.
- Gregor!

180
00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:47.135
What's your business there?
Move along!

181
00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:48.970
I'm not a brave man.

182
00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:53.350
If you know anything about Dryland,
please tell me. Please!

183
00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.269
Don't let it die with you.

184
00:23:56.353 --> 00:23:58.855
No, no, no, no. Stop!

185
00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:02.525
Gregor! Move along!

186
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:42.232
After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

187
00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:48.321
it is our decision that this mute-o does,
indeed, constitute a threat.

188
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:52.575
Therefore, in the interest of public safety,

189
00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:56.287
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled

190
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:58.415
in the customary fashion.

191
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:00.750
Proceed.

192
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:08.466
I'm sorry.

193
00:25:13.722 --> 00:25:18.018
Bones to berries. Veins to vines.

194
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:22.147
These tendons to trees.
This blood to brine.

195
00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:25.400
Too strange for life he was.

196
00:25:25.442 --> 00:25:29.320
This mute-o now does leave us,

197
00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:32.323
recycled and entombed,

198
00:25:32.407 --> 00:25:35.952
in the presence of him who leads us.

199
00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:50.425
Smokers! Get out of the sun!

200
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:56.806
To your posts!

201
00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:14.157
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

202
00:26:25.126 --> 00:26:27.796
- Kill!
- There!

203
00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:41.142
We are safe behind this wall.

204
00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:43.603
Aren't we?

205
00:26:52.529 --> 00:26:53.863
Let me out!

206
00:26:54.614 --> 00:26:56.199
Let me out! I'll fight!

207
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.648
Give me the key to the city now.

208
00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:34.779
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

209
00:27:37.574 --> 00:27:40.743
- Floor it! Floor it!
- Come on!

210
00:28:01.639 --> 00:28:04.267
Swab it! Swab it!

211
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.936
God damn! More ammo!

212
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:23.494
Break down the door!

213
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.542
My God!

214
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.843
We'll have this atoll in no time.

215
00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:43.973
Crank it! Crank it!

216
00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:49.395
Look!

217
00:29:08.915 --> 00:29:10.333
Look out!

218
00:29:33.523 --> 00:29:35.483
Oh, no!

219
00:29:46.577 --> 00:29:48.705
Keep that gas going! Fill them up!

220
00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:30.121
Helen, come quickly!

221
00:30:30.204 --> 00:30:32.373
Helen! Helen!

222
00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:04.489
You're not supposed to go yet!

223
00:31:04.572 --> 00:31:06.616
Infernal machine!

224
00:31:10.453 --> 00:31:13.081
Gregor. Gregor, wait!

225
00:31:13.122 --> 00:31:16.292
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I couldn't make it stop. Hurry!

226
00:31:16.376 --> 00:31:18.461
- You can make it if you try. Run!
- Please, stop!

227
00:31:18.503 --> 00:31:20.296
Up those stairs. Run! Quickly!

228
00:31:20.338 --> 00:31:24.300
- Wait! Wait!
- I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!

229
00:31:24.342 --> 00:31:27.720
- Throw the rope now. Run, Enola.
- Slow down! Wait!

230
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:31.140
- No! No!
- Wait!

231
00:31:33.643 --> 00:31:35.645
- Gregor, don't leave us!
- Oh, no!

232
00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:37.980
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

233
00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:45.822
Helen! Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

234
00:31:55.915 --> 00:31:58.167
Shoot him. Shoot him.

235
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:28.030
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

236
00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:30.533
Sure.

237
00:32:34.162 --> 00:32:36.122
Enola, get down.

238
00:32:37.248 --> 00:32:39.208
Here. Get over here. Get down.

239
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.002
Hurry! Come on!

240
00:32:44.672 --> 00:32:45.882
Get the gate.

241
00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:47.235
Hurry up!

242
00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:49.612
Kamikaze! Come on!

243
00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:20.309
That made a hole.

244
00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.324
Find her! Get the girl!

245
00:34:40.413 --> 00:34:41.706
There!

246
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.633
Go get that guy! Go! Kill him!

247
00:34:57.221 --> 00:34:58.764
Enola!

248
00:35:09.567 --> 00:35:12.653
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

249
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:16.407
Come on!

250
00:35:21.912 --> 00:35:24.665
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

251
00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:31.589
It's stuck! I can't make it through!

252
00:35:31.672 --> 00:35:32.965
Let her go!

253
00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.385
Just drop her!

254
00:35:51.317 --> 00:35:54.070
Turn the wheel. The wheel! Turn it!

255
00:35:58.866 --> 00:36:01.619
That! Come on! Push it!

256
00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:04.830
- I am!
- Hurry! Now pull!

257
00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:08.668
Push it! Push it hard! Push it!

258
00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:12.254
Okay, okay! Now pull this!
Pull this! Go! Go!

259
00:36:12.296 --> 00:36:14.715
Pull it! Pull!

260
00:36:26.936 --> 00:36:28.396
Enola, jump.

261
00:36:30.356 --> 00:36:32.983
- Jump! Look at me. Jump! Now!
- Okay!

262
00:36:49.667 --> 00:36:51.961
Well, excuse me!

263
00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:55.214
Did I say anybody could leave
before the battle was over? Did I?

264
00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:58.843
- No! No!
- Well, do something. I hate sails.

265
00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:11.522
Hey! Can you steer?

266
00:37:11.939 --> 00:37:13.524
Can I trust you?

267
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.479
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firing?

268
00:37:52.772 --> 00:37:55.441
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

269
00:37:55.524 --> 00:37:58.986
- Hey, Chuck!
- He's pulling him right into us.

270
00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:03.699
Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck.
Call him Charles. Charles!

271
00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:08.579
Stop him! Stop him!

272
00:38:16.587 --> 00:38:18.047
Charles!

273
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:22.092
<i>Adiós,</i> cousins.

274
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.724
She's here somewhere. Keep looking.

275
00:39:11.517 --> 00:39:12.768
Stop it!

276
00:39:13.561 --> 00:39:15.437
Let me down!

277
00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:23.779
What you got?

278
00:39:23.821 --> 00:39:26.824
Couple of heartbeats over there.
Aren't saying much.

279
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.454
If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood
coming from the hole in my head,

280
00:39:32.496 --> 00:39:36.709
you can assume that we're
all having a real lousy day.

281
00:39:36.792 --> 00:39:40.629
So here it is,
I need to know about that tattooed girl.

282
00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:44.717
First one that tells me lives.

283
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.555
- I saw a girl. I saw...
- It was... She had a big tattoo on her.

284
00:39:52.308 --> 00:39:54.184
You won. Start over.

285
00:39:54.268 --> 00:39:56.145
I saw a girl.

286
00:39:56.228 --> 00:40:00.858
I'm not sure, but I think she got
on that boat with three hulls.

287
00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:04.445
The boat that cost me
1,000 G's of go-juice?

288
00:40:04.486 --> 00:40:06.447
Yeah, the mute-o's boat.

289
00:40:06.488 --> 00:40:10.409
- Mute-o?
- Yeah. He got these slits here.

290
00:40:10.492 --> 00:40:13.996
Like fish gills.

291
00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:16.081
He wasn't really a man.

292
00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:19.460
A fluke of evolution.

293
00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:22.838
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of...

294
00:40:22.922 --> 00:40:25.341
- Evolution.
- I know!

295
00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:29.470
- No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that?

296
00:40:29.511 --> 00:40:32.473
- Witnesses, anybody, did I?
- Yes, yes, yes! You said...

297
00:40:32.514 --> 00:40:34.516
- You said it.
- Oh, I may have.

298
00:40:36.936 --> 00:40:38.395
I may have.

299
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:47.488
We get to the 'Deez,

300
00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:52.117
tank up that sky boat,
send it out on patrol.

301
00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:58.540
We gotta keep an eye out
for that ichthy-freak.

302
00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:24.441
You been there, haven't you?

303
00:41:29.363 --> 00:41:30.739
Dryland?

304
00:41:32.074 --> 00:41:33.575
You know where it is.

305
00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:37.037
Yeah, I know where it is.

306
00:41:40.124 --> 00:41:43.085
And... And we're going?

307
00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:45.587
You and I are.

308
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:49.883
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.

309
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.597
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

310
00:41:56.765 --> 00:41:59.268
I'm taking on water.

311
00:41:59.351 --> 00:42:02.438
I'd be lucky to get half
a hydro ration out of that.

312
00:42:02.521 --> 00:42:05.983
You know... I said I won't drink.

313
00:42:06.692 --> 00:42:07.943
For 12 days?

314
00:42:10.654 --> 00:42:15.534
No. It's better one of you dies now
than both of you die slow.

315
00:42:15.617 --> 00:42:16.869
Wait. Wait.

316
00:42:17.995 --> 00:42:21.081
We saved your life. We got you out.

317
00:42:21.123 --> 00:42:24.626
No, you got me out so you could get out.
We're even.

318
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.795
She can cook. She can fish.

319
00:42:26.879 --> 00:42:29.131
- So can I.
- Then take my necklace. Take my necklace.

320
00:42:29.214 --> 00:42:31.467
- I got better ones below.
- No, look!

321
00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:37.556
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

322
00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:39.975
I can understand
why you would want to.

323
00:42:40.768 --> 00:42:42.686
But she's a child.

324
00:42:53.906 --> 00:42:55.824
Is there something else, then?

325
00:43:01.663 --> 00:43:03.499
Enola! Go below.

326
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.460
Enola.

327
00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:18.764
Yeah.

328
00:43:19.515 --> 00:43:21.350
You said so yourself.

329
00:43:22.851 --> 00:43:24.686
Been out there a long time.

330
00:44:11.233 --> 00:44:14.153
Couple hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

331
00:44:14.486 --> 00:44:16.113
We're not like that.

332
00:44:16.738 --> 00:44:18.073
You all are.

333
00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:25.998
Know what I was really thinking?

334
00:44:26.623 --> 00:44:29.751
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

335
00:44:31.211 --> 00:44:32.963
You got nothing I need.

336
00:44:49.605 --> 00:44:51.773
You're taking us to Dryland.

337
00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:59.448
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

338
00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:03.035
- Believe me. I'm not the one to start on.
- Both of us!

339
00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:10.834
How long you plan to hold that on me?

340
00:45:10.918 --> 00:45:12.711
As long as it takes.

341
00:45:15.964 --> 00:45:18.300
- Okay.
- No!

342
00:45:20.135 --> 00:45:23.263
Let me out of here!

343
00:45:23.305 --> 00:45:27.142
Where the hell are you?
Don't you touch my child.

344
00:45:27.226 --> 00:45:29.061
Come here!

345
00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:20.320
Okay, now, don't move, okay? There.

346
00:46:20.362 --> 00:46:23.657
Oh, looking real good, yeah.

347
00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:26.034
There. There.

348
00:46:26.118 --> 00:46:27.911
All done.

349
00:46:27.995 --> 00:46:31.540
Now, there may be some
small problem in depth perception.

350
00:46:31.581 --> 00:46:34.251
Well, it better not screw up
my short game.

351
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.421
Well?

352
00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:39.172
- Looks good.
- I like it. Yeah.

353
00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:42.175
- I like it better than your real eye.
- Much better.

354
00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:46.054
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.
- Looks like shit.

355
00:46:46.138 --> 00:46:48.890
That's why I love children. No guile.

356
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:55.272
It does look like shit.

357
00:46:56.315 --> 00:46:58.608
And it feels like cold shit!

358
00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:01.403
- Deacon?
- What...

359
00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:06.033
I'm sorry.
It's just that there's a problem in the pit.

360
00:47:06.074 --> 00:47:07.701
Maybe you should come.

361
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:14.624
Let's drive.

362
00:47:22.924 --> 00:47:25.761
The pit.
Don't bother with the scenic route.

363
00:47:25.844 --> 00:47:27.179
Drive!

364
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.640
Hey, it's driving better.

365
00:47:43.528 --> 00:47:44.946
Get off!

366
00:47:46.448 --> 00:47:49.117
Get off. Get out of the way.

367
00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:51.745
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

368
00:47:54.289 --> 00:47:57.876
Bless you, cousins. Bless you.
Bless all you cousins over there.

369
00:47:57.959 --> 00:47:59.294
Keep up the good work.

370
00:47:59.336 --> 00:48:02.297
Growth is progress.
Growth is progress.

371
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:07.052
Somebody! Hey, up there!

372
00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:09.054
Take it off!

373
00:48:11.973 --> 00:48:14.810
- Yes.
- Your Deaconship.

374
00:48:14.851 --> 00:48:17.604
Hello. Good morning.

375
00:48:17.646 --> 00:48:21.316
Or night, whichever the case may be.

376
00:48:21.358 --> 00:48:25.153
- What is it? I'm a busy man.
- I thought you should know.

377
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:30.158
We're down to exactly
four feet, nine inches

378
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.952
of black stuff.

379
00:48:35.997 --> 00:48:37.499
Thank you, sir.

380
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:41.002
- How many G's is that after refining?
- Maybe three refuelers.

381
00:48:41.044 --> 00:48:43.672
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.
- Sweet Joe!

382
00:48:43.713 --> 00:48:47.008
Will somebody please tell me
what's happening to this place?

383
00:48:47.843 --> 00:48:49.344
We outgrowed it.

384
00:48:50.262 --> 00:48:54.266
All right, the only thing that is
important is the tattooed girl.

385
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:57.310
We don't spare any go-juice finding her.

386
00:48:57.352 --> 00:49:00.939
We don't waste it anywhere else.
You cancel all those tractor pulls

387
00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:02.858
and all that stuff until later.

388
00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:04.276
You got it?

389
00:49:06.027 --> 00:49:08.989
Dryland is the mother lode.

390
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:11.575
On your toes.

391
00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.411
Excellent.

392
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:46.568
- Hi.
- Move.

393
00:49:47.319 --> 00:49:49.738
Enola! Enola, come here!

394
00:49:51.865 --> 00:49:53.116
Come on!

395
00:49:55.911 --> 00:49:58.038
Enola, come over here.

396
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:13.094
Hey!

397
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:20.393
- What are you doing?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

398
00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:26.900
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

399
00:50:26.942 --> 00:50:29.986
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

400
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.238
I drew it for you.

401
00:50:31.279 --> 00:50:33.782
You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

402
00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:40.455
What...

403
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.294
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

404
00:50:46.378 --> 00:50:49.047
You take up space
and you slow me down.

405
00:50:52.801 --> 00:50:55.637
You know, she's just a little girl.

406
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.848
- She doesn't know your rules.
- You wanna stay?

407
00:50:58.932 --> 00:51:00.475
You teach her.

408
00:51:20.245 --> 00:51:22.289
Enola, what'd I tell you?

409
00:51:27.752 --> 00:51:29.921
You're not so tough. You know that?

410
00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:36.511
How many people have you killed?

411
00:51:39.306 --> 00:51:42.183
Ten? Twenty?

412
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:48.023
- You talk a lot.
- I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all.

413
00:51:48.732 --> 00:51:50.442
Now, how many?

414
00:51:52.527 --> 00:51:53.862
Including little girls?

415
00:51:54.779 --> 00:51:56.239
I'm not afraid of you.

416
00:51:59.909 --> 00:52:03.371
I told Helen you wouldn't be
so ugly if you cut your hair.

417
00:52:07.334 --> 00:52:09.169
In fact, you talk all the time.

418
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.546
- It's like a storm when you're around.
- Enola!

419
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.340
Hey! What are you doing?

420
00:52:14.215 --> 00:52:17.594
- Helen!
- You bastard! She can't swim!

421
00:52:18.011 --> 00:52:20.889
Help me! Helen!

422
00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:24.142
Helen, help me!

423
00:52:24.726 --> 00:52:26.144
Helen!

424
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:28.897
Helen, help me!

425
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:40.033
Helen! Helen!

426
00:52:40.075 --> 00:52:41.701
Hold on!

427
00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:44.788
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

428
00:52:46.206 --> 00:52:50.126
Oh, please, come back. Please!

429
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.338
Please! Oh, please!

430
00:52:58.426 --> 00:52:59.594
Hey!

431
00:53:02.722 --> 00:53:05.475
Hold on. Okay, almost.

432
00:53:18.822 --> 00:53:23.827
Thanks. I swear,
if you ever touch her again...

433
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.954
You son of a bitch. Look at me.

434
00:53:26.037 --> 00:53:28.790
You will go to bed that night
and you will never wake up.

435
00:53:28.832 --> 00:53:31.126
- Shut up.
- What?

436
00:53:31.918 --> 00:53:34.170
- Smokers?
- Yeah.

437
00:53:34.254 --> 00:53:36.506
Can't we outrun them?

438
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.427
Not with my sail down.

439
00:53:58.486 --> 00:54:00.029
What are you thinking about?

440
00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:01.823
That's a nice touch.

441
00:54:02.657 --> 00:54:03.992
That's them.

442
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:12.667
Don't hit the kid.

443
00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:29.642
Hey!

444
00:54:35.857 --> 00:54:37.317
Coward!

445
00:54:46.284 --> 00:54:47.452
Fuck!

446
00:55:16.064 --> 00:55:17.065
No!

447
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:31.830
Joe!

448
00:55:39.254 --> 00:55:40.463
Cut it!

449
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:51.808
Come on! Come on!

450
00:56:25.717 --> 00:56:28.052
All right. Okay.

451
00:57:28.529 --> 00:57:31.032
Oh, I'm really sorry.

452
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:34.535
I'm sorry.
But you didn't give me much choice.

453
00:57:34.577 --> 00:57:35.912
Oh, I know.

454
00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:39.707
But you ran away. I... What?

455
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:43.086
What are you...
No! Please, no! No!

456
00:57:52.887 --> 00:57:57.350
Don't ever touch anything
on my boat again.

457
00:58:00.812 --> 00:58:02.730
She said she was sorry!

458
00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:09.862
That means you're supposed
to say something back!

459
00:58:32.385 --> 00:58:34.220
- Did you say something?
- Mmm-mmm.

460
00:58:58.244 --> 00:58:59.996
The child...
Did he have the girl with him?

461
00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:05.710
Seems to me if we launch now,
we can cut him down just about here.

462
00:59:06.794 --> 00:59:10.048
- If he doesn't change course.
- It's not likely.

463
00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:13.718
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.

464
00:59:14.135 --> 00:59:16.512
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

465
00:59:16.596 --> 00:59:20.475
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

466
00:59:20.516 --> 00:59:24.020
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

467
00:59:24.103 --> 00:59:27.315
The important question is,
where's he heading?

468
00:59:27.398 --> 00:59:30.985
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

469
00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:35.281
I say that he's headed here,
and we take him here.

470
00:59:43.164 --> 00:59:44.832
Hello!

471
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:47.960
Drifter?

472
00:59:49.337 --> 00:59:51.005
Are we gonna stop?

473
00:59:51.089 --> 00:59:53.007
- Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

474
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:55.551
I thought you all stopped for each other.

475
01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:03.476
Well, maybe he has some food!

476
01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:08.564
Don't find many who follow
the rules anymore.

477
01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:12.151
Well, make it quick.
What's your business?

478
01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:18.449
Trade.

479
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.537
You got any resin?

480
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:30.211
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind.
He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin.

481
01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:33.172
You been outwater a long time,
haven't you?

482
01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:37.051
Must be joking me, man. Resin!
You don't got enough.

483
01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:38.845
How about food?

484
01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:40.888
Could you say that again, please?

485
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.849
How about food?

486
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:46.394
Yeah, food.
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

487
01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:49.397
I haven't eaten in, well,
you know, forever.

488
01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:55.236
Which one of you two is the cook?
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.

489
01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.073
Like you said, I don't have much.

490
01:00:59.157 --> 01:01:02.076
I'll say. Let's see.

491
01:01:02.535 --> 01:01:05.580
We can start with that wee
orchard you got over there.

492
01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.251
All right, hold it there.

493
01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:13.254
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

494
01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:21.929
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

495
01:01:21.971 --> 01:01:24.182
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

496
01:01:31.439 --> 01:01:34.192
Got yourself a wee harem going here,
now, don't you, eh?

497
01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.617
What do you want for the women?

498
01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:44.327
We're not for sale.

499
01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.247
Not for sale?
There's no such thing as not for sale.

500
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:50.750
"Not for sale"! Not for sale, eh?

501
01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:55.713
Are they a pair, or would you
consider selling them separate?

502
01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.715
No. Our business is done here

503
01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:59.967
unless you got some resin
for sale you can part with.

504
01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:02.053
I told you once already, I don't have it.

505
01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:04.597
I don't have it.
Don't have it. Don't have it.

506
01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:08.809
Haven't seen that there for trade in lunars now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

507
01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:15.191
I do have something that'll
make you change your mind.

508
01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:18.319
Something that you can't pass on.

509
01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:23.032
I took it off an atoller refugee camp.

510
01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:26.327
The life savings of the entire clan.

511
01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:37.171
Paper. Look at my wee paper.

512
01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:42.343
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper?
Look at it.

513
01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:43.678
Smell it.

514
01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.391
I been saving it for a special trade.

515
01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:52.937
Don't you do it.

516
01:02:53.688 --> 01:02:56.607
You know, maybe I'm talking
to the wrong person here.

517
01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:59.527
Whose boat is this?
Is it your boat or your boat?

518
01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:02.655
No. No, it's his boat.
But he doesn't own us.

519
01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:11.372
Half an hour.

520
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.543
Is he out of his mind or something here?

521
01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:17.461
I got two pages in here, man!

522
01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:19.630
I mean, I'd get half a dozen
girls with this, you know.

523
01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:20.881
Half an hour.

524
01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.801
You trading or not?

525
01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:24.885
Don't.

526
01:03:24.969 --> 01:03:26.053
Shut up.

527
01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.098
Okay.

528
01:03:31.726 --> 01:03:34.228
Forty-five minutes
with the wee one over there.

529
01:03:34.312 --> 01:03:36.772
I like to do the talking,
if you know what I mean.

530
01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:39.150
No!

531
01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:44.613
Fair enough.
Come, come, come, come, come!

532
01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:47.241
No. My boat.

533
01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:51.579
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Good, good, good. Aye.

534
01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:52.830
Helen.

535
01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:56.250
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

536
01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:44.048
It's been a while for me now.

537
01:04:45.216 --> 01:04:48.260
Guess it's been more
than a while, actually.

538
01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:56.644
I've only got half an hour.
Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour...

539
01:04:58.062 --> 01:05:00.147
Right, right, right...

540
01:05:01.649 --> 01:05:04.735
You're so beautiful. Aye!
Anyone ever told you that?

541
01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:07.988
Give me that. What are you doing?
It's just a game.

542
01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:14.328
Oh, I... I...
We was just playing.

543
01:05:17.415 --> 01:05:19.458
The trade's off.

544
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.877
I changed my mind.

545
01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:25.548
Well, you can't do that.

546
01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:28.008
I mean, a deal's a deal, aye?

547
01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:30.594
I just did.

548
01:05:30.803 --> 01:05:32.304
Hey!

549
01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:36.892
She's mine. Aye. No.
No, no, I won't have it, no.

550
01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.854
- Go on.
- Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good.

551
01:05:39.895 --> 01:05:44.233
But don't go too far, now.
This won't take but a minute.

552
01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:53.784
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!

553
01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:56.579
You bastard.

554
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:06.714
You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't you, now?

555
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.232
You bastard!

556
01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:38.412
Where's me boat?

557
01:06:39.872 --> 01:06:41.248
Where's me boat?

558
01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:50.633
Help me to me boat.

559
01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.012
Me boat.

560
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:29.755
What the... No!

561
01:07:31.632 --> 01:07:34.426
Never catch anything with this.
It's useless.

562
01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:45.229
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right about the pole.

563
01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:48.816
You were right, but we have to eat.

564
01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:56.073
Now, I know you can hear me!

565
01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:59.660
Now, we can fish for ourselves.
You show us what to do.

566
01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.371
You must know how.
Even you gotta eat!

567
01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:03.914
You just sit there.

568
01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:29.398
What...

569
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:30.858
I don't know.

570
01:09:07.186 --> 01:09:08.771
Happy now?

571
01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:29.333
You don't like my singing, do you?

572
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:36.090
Helen says you don't like my singing
'cause you can't sing.

573
01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:44.723
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

574
01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.436
The sound of the world.

575
01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:57.319
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud

576
01:09:57.403 --> 01:09:59.405
and you're moving around all the time.

577
01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:01.115
Try sitting still.

578
01:10:03.075 --> 01:10:04.535
Eyeball?

579
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.469
I wish I had feet like his.

580
01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:26.515
Then maybe I could swim.

581
01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:28.058
Enola.

582
01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:34.481
Sorry.

583
01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:41.405
Never met a person
who couldn't swim before.

584
01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:45.325
I can't.

585
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.788
People said I was weird.

586
01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:52.583
Maybe they were right.

587
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:58.172
Maybe they were right about you, too.

588
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.160
Enola wanted to give you this.

589
01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:34.166
And this.

590
01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:39.254
She won't take it again.

591
01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.638
You don't look much like her.

592
01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:51.558
Well, I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.

593
01:11:51.642 --> 01:11:53.018
You act like it.

594
01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:58.732
What are those marks on her back?

595
01:11:58.816 --> 01:12:01.819
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.

596
01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:04.446
Like what she draws?

597
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.240
She draws what she sees.

598
01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:08.492
She's like a mirror.

599
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:12.329
People on the atoll thought she was a...

600
01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:15.207
Freak?

601
01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:19.086
Yeah.

602
01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.171
I just thought she was special.

603
01:12:29.555 --> 01:12:32.850
I'm not giving it to her. It's just...

604
01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:34.226
A loan.

605
01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:38.105
Yeah. I'm not giving it to her.

606
01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:45.153
Is Dryland beautiful?

607
01:12:47.948 --> 01:12:49.199
You'll see.

608
01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.144
Enola?

609
01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:20.731
Enola, what are you doing?

610
01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:22.608
Those monsters'll kill her!

611
01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.318
No, they're asleep now.

612
01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:28.906
Hands around my neck.

613
01:13:30.991 --> 01:13:33.827
Let the water tell your arms
and legs how to move.

614
01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:36.622
We're going down. Hold your breath.

615
01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:18.807
- What is it?
- What is it?

616
01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.561
Barter outpost.

617
01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:25.105
You said we'd get to Dryland today.

618
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.358
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?

619
01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:30.861
I need resin.

620
01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:42.497
What is that?

621
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:43.957
It's PortuGreek.

622
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.002
Their own language.

623
01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.381
Or so I thought.

624
01:16:20.702 --> 01:16:23.997
There's my girl. Yeah.

625
01:16:24.039 --> 01:16:27.918
Howdy, darling. Come on in here now.

626
01:16:56.905 --> 01:16:59.825
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

627
01:17:02.953 --> 01:17:04.579
What the hell?

628
01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:11.461
He's spotted us. Sound it!

629
01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:15.465
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

630
01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:38.029
Enola!

631
01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:53.128
Starboard side! Now!

632
01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:55.839
Get in the chair!

633
01:18:02.554 --> 01:18:04.598
Watch it. He's clearing the net.

634
01:18:16.902 --> 01:18:18.236
Go to the helm.

635
01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:23.450
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

636
01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:26.286
What centerboard?
I don't know what to do!

637
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:30.790
It's too late. Over here!

638
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:51.937
No!

639
01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:10.247
Give me that rifle.

640
01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:15.835
Boy, if you wanna do something right,
you've got to do it yourself.

641
01:19:16.253 --> 01:19:17.712
All right.

642
01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.179
I winged him.

643
01:19:26.263 --> 01:19:29.808
I say we load all the go-juice onto
one boat and run the freak down.

644
01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:33.478
You can't catch him in ten boats,
and you wanna send just one?

645
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.106
Well, I pray that you're joking.

646
01:19:44.364 --> 01:19:46.116
Bring me the trackers.

647
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.999
He's hurt.

648
01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:57.419
It's not what you think.
They weren't after her.

649
01:19:57.502 --> 01:19:58.920
I saw what I saw.

650
01:19:59.004 --> 01:20:00.130
What?

651
01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:05.844
No more lies.

652
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.515
What are the marks on her back?

653
01:20:10.932 --> 01:20:14.185
People say it's the way to Dryland.

654
01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:15.895
Dryland's a myth!

655
01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:18.898
No! You said so yourself
that you know where it is.

656
01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:20.734
You did.

657
01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:29.242
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

658
01:20:29.326 --> 01:20:33.496
I've seen it. I've touched it!
Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.

659
01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.582
It was in the basket we found Enola in!

660
01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:38.251
- It doesn't exist!
- Well, how can you be so sure?

661
01:20:38.293 --> 01:20:43.131
Because I've sailed farther than most
have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

662
01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:46.760
But the things on your boat!

663
01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:50.096
"Things on my boat" what?

664
01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.600
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

665
01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.935
What are these shells?

666
01:20:55.977 --> 01:20:58.938
And that reflecting glass?

667
01:20:59.022 --> 01:21:02.317
And the music box? That...

668
01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:07.030
Well, if not from Dryland,
then where? Where?

669
01:21:10.075 --> 01:21:11.743
You wanna see Dryland?

670
01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:15.622
You really wanna see it?

671
01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:19.417
I'll take you to Dryland.

672
01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:28.635
Get in.

673
01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:38.061
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

674
01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.438
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

675
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:47.821
Don't touch anything.

676
01:21:52.826 --> 01:21:54.285
Okay?

677
01:25:25.622 --> 01:25:27.081
I didn't know.

678
01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.044
All this time...

679
01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:34.422
I didn't know.

680
01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.049
Nobody does.

681
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:46.392
Can you get us out of here?

682
01:25:46.434 --> 01:25:49.937
I'd say there're two chances of that.

683
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:52.440
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

684
01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:56.235
Should've bought me that drink.
Come on!

685
01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:57.904
This way. Come on!

686
01:26:05.244 --> 01:26:07.413
Proper introductions first.

687
01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:09.749
I'm the Deacon.

688
01:26:15.046 --> 01:26:19.676
If you don't recall the face, perhaps
it's 'cause I didn't always look like this.

689
01:26:23.054 --> 01:26:27.433
Now, I suspect she's
somewhere real close.

690
01:26:27.475 --> 01:26:29.769
So we can tear this boat apart
looking for her,

691
01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:32.522
but I'd rather somebody
tell me where she is.

692
01:26:32.605 --> 01:26:35.316
And the first one that does that lives.

693
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.238
And the runner-up...
Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

694
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.118
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

695
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:48.287
Choose them.
One, two. Live or die.

696
01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:52.667
You know, personally,

697
01:26:52.792 --> 01:26:55.753
I'd rather shoot
the sperm-of-the-devil here.

698
01:26:57.296 --> 01:26:59.132
But you know something?

699
01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:01.676
I don't think you're
gonna tell me, are you?

700
01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:03.803
Too bad.

701
01:27:04.804 --> 01:27:08.182
Come on. What do you say?

702
01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:10.309
She's not your kind.

703
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:14.147
You don't even have a kind.

704
01:27:14.188 --> 01:27:17.942
If you say it, he'll still kill us both.

705
01:27:22.697 --> 01:27:24.824
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

706
01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:28.578
If you don't tell me,

707
01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:31.664
I swear to Poseidon
I will torch your boat.

708
01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:41.466
Refresh my memory.
What happens when neither of them talks?

709
01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:44.343
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

710
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.054
All right!

711
01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:49.807
If they won't tell us
where she is, do them!

712
01:27:49.849 --> 01:27:52.226
Both of them! Kill them now!

713
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:53.644
No!

714
01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:55.062
No!

715
01:27:55.146 --> 01:27:57.690
So gullible! Bring her here.

716
01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:02.528
- Take and ye shall receive!
- No! Leave her!

717
01:28:02.612 --> 01:28:05.531
So ends your daily sermonette!

718
01:28:05.615 --> 01:28:09.076
All we gotta do is figure out this map.
Turn her upside down.

719
01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.622
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

720
01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:16.042
We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez.
Back at the 'Deez, boys.

721
01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:18.503
Careful with her. Careful with her!

722
01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:20.963
- What about them?
- Do them both.

723
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.632
Torch the boat.

724
01:28:27.053 --> 01:28:28.679
We have to go under!

725
01:28:30.765 --> 01:28:32.767
No, I can't breathe like you!

726
01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:35.394
I'll breathe for both of us.

727
01:29:02.213 --> 01:29:03.631
Helen!

728
01:29:06.259 --> 01:29:07.927
Helen, help!

729
01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:11.848
Helen! Helen!

730
01:29:42.837 --> 01:29:44.338
My boat.

731
01:29:54.307 --> 01:29:55.641
Enola.

732
01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:01.606
What is this? Get those chains off her.

733
01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:04.567
What are we, barbarians here?

734
01:30:04.650 --> 01:30:07.028
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.

735
01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:09.906
Come on out of here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

736
01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:13.159
Well, rub-a-dub-dub.

737
01:30:15.369 --> 01:30:17.872
You wanna come over here
and sit on my lap?

738
01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:20.291
No?

739
01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:23.461
How about a cigarette?

740
01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:28.341
Nothing like a good smoke
if you miss your mom.

741
01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:30.343
Never too young to start.

742
01:30:31.844 --> 01:30:35.598
No. Well, I got something
right here I know you'd like.

743
01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:38.976
Like to draw, don't you?

744
01:30:43.481 --> 01:30:45.024
Now, they're yours,

745
01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:50.738
if you help me with just
one problem, all right?

746
01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:56.661
Now, that tattoo on your back...

747
01:30:58.537 --> 01:31:03.459
I've been told that
that's actually a map?

748
01:31:06.003 --> 01:31:08.339
It's the way to Dryland.

749
01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:10.216
Now we're getting someplace.

750
01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:15.388
Could you teach me how to read that?

751
01:31:17.807 --> 01:31:19.016
Setback.

752
01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:26.232
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

753
01:31:26.315 --> 01:31:29.944
You know,
like your mommy or your pet fish?

754
01:31:30.027 --> 01:31:31.529
Did he say anything?

755
01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:34.073
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

756
01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:39.078
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like.
He took out my eye.

757
01:31:39.578 --> 01:31:41.080
And if I ever see him again,

758
01:31:41.122 --> 01:31:45.501
I'm gonna cut open his head
and eat his brains!

759
01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:47.795
You think he'd like that?

760
01:31:47.878 --> 01:31:51.757
Can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

761
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:54.802
But he's not here.

762
01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:56.887
And he ain't coming.

763
01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:59.098
And no one's gonna save you.

764
01:32:00.266 --> 01:32:02.226
He'll come for me. He will.

765
01:32:02.268 --> 01:32:04.812
Then you better tell me
what I wanna know

766
01:32:04.895 --> 01:32:08.441
or he can see what's left
of you in a goddamn jar.

767
01:32:18.784 --> 01:32:20.911
We're going to die here, aren't we?

768
01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:42.266
Aren't we?

769
01:32:52.068 --> 01:32:53.903
After the atoll,

770
01:32:55.029 --> 01:32:57.156
when I offered myself to you,

771
01:33:00.326 --> 01:33:02.119
why didn't you take me?

772
01:33:04.622 --> 01:33:06.707
'Cause you didn't really want me.

773
01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:10.252
Not really.

774
01:35:07.286 --> 01:35:08.954
Have I been asleep long?

775
01:35:15.294 --> 01:35:16.754
I was dreaming.

776
01:35:19.924 --> 01:35:21.217
It's funny.

777
01:35:22.885 --> 01:35:24.970
I always thought Dryland floated.

778
01:35:25.638 --> 01:35:29.516
That it drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

779
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.852
Why did you believe in it so much?

780
01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:35.481
Because we weren't made for the sea.

781
01:35:37.024 --> 01:35:40.319
Got hands and feet.

782
01:35:40.361 --> 01:35:42.112
We're supposed to walk.

783
01:35:46.033 --> 01:35:47.660
I miss her sound.

784
01:35:50.329 --> 01:35:51.497
Don't you?

785
01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:56.627
Helen!

786
01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:00.756
No, no, no.
Helen, up here. Above you!

787
01:36:00.839 --> 01:36:02.675
Gregor!

788
01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:10.349
Smart thinking, to burn your boat.

789
01:36:10.391 --> 01:36:14.186
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

790
01:36:14.228 --> 01:36:16.355
Who's that with you?

791
01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:19.692
<i>Ichthyus sapien</i>, is that really you?

792
01:36:20.567 --> 01:36:24.405
I'll throw the rope down. You catch it.
I'll help you climb up.

793
01:36:26.198 --> 01:36:30.327
Helen. Where's Enola?

794
01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:35.374
Smokers took her.
They'd have me, too, if it weren't for him.

795
01:36:35.416 --> 01:36:39.753
My friend, thank you.
Very human of you.

796
01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:43.799
Go grab your things quickly.
Quickly. Come.

797
01:36:52.099 --> 01:36:54.226
You see? Right down there.

798
01:36:54.268 --> 01:36:57.646
There's several of us survivors.
We'll just start over again.

799
01:36:59.398 --> 01:37:00.983
You can't ask us to go get her!

800
01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:02.693
Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble.

801
01:37:02.735 --> 01:37:04.069
Forget it! We're not going.

802
01:37:04.153 --> 01:37:05.738
They don't have any reason to kill her.

803
01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:08.324
They need to find Dryland
just like we do.

804
01:37:08.407 --> 01:37:09.742
Of course.

805
01:37:09.825 --> 01:37:12.536
If the Mariner's willing to go,
why not us?

806
01:37:12.578 --> 01:37:14.288
If he wants to go, then let him!

807
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:16.915
We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

808
01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:22.421
Helen. The papers
the Mariner brought you...

809
01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:26.091
It's the same language
the tattoo is written in.

810
01:37:26.175 --> 01:37:27.426
They're numbers.

811
01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:30.596
- Gregor, you're as crazy as she is!
- We can't stay here!

812
01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:31.847
We're wasting valuable time.

813
01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:34.266
More Smokers will come.
We need to be moving now!

814
01:37:34.308 --> 01:37:38.562
My friends, don't you see we need
this child if we want to find Dryland?

815
01:37:38.604 --> 01:37:40.647
- I'm not going.
- Nobody is.

816
01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:43.192
We've seen their smoke on the horizon!

817
01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:46.028
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

818
01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:49.907
It seems to be some ancient
form of geographic location,

819
01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:51.492
latitude, longitude.

820
01:37:51.575 --> 01:37:53.118
It doesn't make sense, though.

821
01:37:53.202 --> 01:37:56.455
The numbers, they seem
to be backwards or something.

822
01:37:56.497 --> 01:37:58.791
- It's upside down.
- The world?

823
01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:01.460
The poles have reversed themselves?

824
01:38:01.502 --> 01:38:03.670
I've been mapping the cities below.

825
01:38:06.298 --> 01:38:09.968
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

826
01:38:10.052 --> 01:38:13.180
- That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

827
01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:18.060
I've seen it with my own eyes.
There is land. It's right under our keel.

828
01:38:18.143 --> 01:38:20.312
- None of it's dry anymore.
- Some is.

829
01:38:21.939 --> 01:38:26.151
Enola's been there. I know that now.
I saw what she drew.

830
01:38:26.193 --> 01:38:30.322
So that's why he's going after Enola,
to find Dryland.

831
01:38:30.948 --> 01:38:32.991
I don't care about Dryland.

832
01:38:33.075 --> 01:38:35.911
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

833
01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:37.996
He doesn't even know which
direction they came from.

834
01:38:38.038 --> 01:38:41.250
- I say let him go.
- We're better off without them anyway!

835
01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:45.504
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

836
01:38:47.089 --> 01:38:51.343
Forget the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

837
01:38:51.427 --> 01:38:55.431
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

838
01:38:55.514 --> 01:38:59.351
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

839
01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:08.152
You got that tattoo figured out yet?

840
01:39:08.193 --> 01:39:11.238
It would be easier if it was flat,
big and flat.

841
01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:14.158
- It needs to be flat.
- What you got in mind?

842
01:39:14.199 --> 01:39:18.537
Well, you cut it off her back.
You stretch it, mount it.

843
01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:22.124
- Give us a proper look.
- Take her down below until I holler.

844
01:39:23.208 --> 01:39:25.127
Saint Joe, we're close.

845
01:39:26.879 --> 01:39:29.131
After centuries of shame.

846
01:40:59.596 --> 01:41:02.558
- They're getting ugly.
- Don't I know it.

847
01:41:03.559 --> 01:41:05.644
Announce me, cousin.

848
01:41:10.065 --> 01:41:11.775
<i>Hey. Here he is.</i>

849
01:41:11.817 --> 01:41:13.652
Deacon!

850
01:41:13.694 --> 01:41:16.446
<i>Rise up, brothers and sisters.</i>

851
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:21.368
<i>Turn your eyes and open your hearts</i>

852
01:41:21.451 --> 01:41:23.829
<i>to your humble benefactor,</i>

853
01:41:23.912 --> 01:41:27.666
<i>your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,</i>

854
01:41:27.708 --> 01:41:30.460
<i>the Deacon of the 'Deez.</i>

855
01:42:02.034 --> 01:42:03.619
Deacon!

856
01:42:05.704 --> 01:42:09.625
<i>Children. Children of the provider.</i>

857
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:15.213
<i>Citizens of the good ship.
Please, now, hear me speak.</i>

858
01:42:19.259 --> 01:42:22.304
- <i>I've had a vision.</i>
- Yeah, we're tired of your visions!

859
01:42:22.387 --> 01:42:24.264
What about the land you promised us?

860
01:42:24.348 --> 01:42:27.392
Yeah!

861
01:42:27.476 --> 01:42:30.062
<i>Oh, ye of little faith.</i>

862
01:42:30.103 --> 01:42:32.397
<i>I've had a vision so great</i>

863
01:42:32.439 --> 01:42:35.859
<i>that as it came to me, I wept.</i>

864
01:42:35.901 --> 01:42:38.236
<i>And in this splenditudinous
figment of wonder...</i>

865
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.571
Is that Bone's ride?

866
01:42:39.655 --> 01:42:42.240
- Is that blood on the seat?
- <i>...I saw.</i>

867
01:42:42.282 --> 01:42:46.036
<i>And you know what it is that I saw.</i>

868
01:42:46.078 --> 01:42:50.332
<i>I saw the land.</i>

869
01:43:22.989 --> 01:43:24.366
Horse, that you?

870
01:43:29.788 --> 01:43:33.041
Look, just bring it in slow, okay?
I don't have all day.

871
01:43:35.502 --> 01:43:36.712
Horse!

872
01:43:36.795 --> 01:43:38.380
Just bring it up slow.

873
01:43:40.257 --> 01:43:43.051
I said slow! No, Horse!

874
01:43:47.848 --> 01:43:51.184
Shouldn't be doing that.
You're gonna get in trouble.

875
01:43:52.644 --> 01:43:54.146
That's right.

876
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:55.564
You're not afraid.

877
01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:58.400
You've got your pet freak
coming to rescue you.

878
01:43:58.483 --> 01:44:01.069
He's not a freak,
and he can take you anytime.

879
01:44:02.946 --> 01:44:07.200
He's killed dozens of people,
and he doesn't have any mercy or anything.

880
01:44:07.284 --> 01:44:09.369
He even kills little girls.

881
01:44:11.288 --> 01:44:12.831
Haven't we all?

882
01:44:14.416 --> 01:44:15.542
Shit.

883
01:44:16.835 --> 01:44:17.961
It's Horse.

884
01:44:20.338 --> 01:44:22.632
- Find him. Find him!
- Come on!

885
01:44:24.885 --> 01:44:27.554
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

886
01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:31.099
- Come on.
- Getting nervous, aren't you?

887
01:44:35.228 --> 01:44:36.688
I don't get nervous.

888
01:44:38.523 --> 01:44:41.193
<i>And if there's a river, we'll dam it.</i>

889
01:44:41.276 --> 01:44:45.155
<i>And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.</i>

890
01:44:45.989 --> 01:44:48.700
<i>'Cause I'm talking progress here.</i>

891
01:44:48.784 --> 01:44:52.037
<i>Yes, sir. I'm talking development.</i>

892
01:44:52.078 --> 01:44:53.121
Yeah!

893
01:44:53.205 --> 01:44:58.001
<i>For we shall suck and savor
the sweet flavor</i>

894
01:44:58.043 --> 01:45:00.712
<i>of Dryland.</i>

895
01:45:01.004 --> 01:45:02.714
Face is all red.

896
01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:07.594
Helen said with anybody
that has a face that red,

897
01:45:07.677 --> 01:45:10.055
he's had too much sun
or too much to drink.

898
01:45:10.138 --> 01:45:14.100
- All right, that's it.
I'm gonna burn your face.
- Almost time.

899
01:45:15.644 --> 01:45:16.895
What's up?

900
01:45:16.937 --> 01:45:19.064
We're just talking about her friend.

901
01:45:20.482 --> 01:45:23.777
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

902
01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.904
So death can't find him.

903
01:45:31.535 --> 01:45:34.079
Doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

904
01:45:35.247 --> 01:45:38.834
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

905
01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:42.170
<i>He's fast and strong like a big wind.</i>

906
01:45:42.254 --> 01:45:46.049
<i>He can hear 100 miles
and see 100 miles underwater.</i>

907
01:45:46.091 --> 01:45:48.593
<i>He can hide in the shadow
of the noon sun.</i>

908
01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:53.431
He could be right behind you,
and you won't even know it till you're dead!

909
01:45:55.767 --> 01:45:57.060
Give it a rest.

910
01:45:59.145 --> 01:46:01.189
He'll come for me. He will.

911
01:46:01.273 --> 01:46:03.942
- <i>We are the reason.</i>
- Yeah?

912
01:46:03.984 --> 01:46:07.153
- Well, I hope he does.
- <i>The Lord's creation.</i>

913
01:46:09.239 --> 01:46:10.949
Remember you said that.

914
01:46:11.783 --> 01:46:13.493
<i>Look at us.</i>

915
01:46:14.452 --> 01:46:16.913
- <i>Look at us here today.</i>
- Yeah!

916
01:46:16.955 --> 01:46:20.667
<i>Dryland is not just our destination,</i>

917
01:46:21.293 --> 01:46:23.837
<i>but it is our destiny!</i>

918
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:34.973
Find him. Find him!

919
01:46:35.056 --> 01:46:39.769
<i>How can I find this glorious place?</i>

920
01:46:40.312 --> 01:46:42.105
<i>And he said to me,</i>

921
01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:47.485
<i>"A child shall lead you."</i>

922
01:46:48.653 --> 01:46:50.947
<i>A child.</i>

923
01:46:50.989 --> 01:46:53.325
- <i>And behold!</i>
- It's time.

924
01:46:53.909 --> 01:46:56.745
<i>The instrument of our salvation!</i>

925
01:47:03.835 --> 01:47:06.463
<i>Our guide in the wild.</i>

926
01:47:06.504 --> 01:47:08.924
<i>Our beacon in the darkness.</i>

927
01:47:09.007 --> 01:47:10.926
Turn her around, Nord.

928
01:47:11.009 --> 01:47:13.803
<i>She has shown me the path!</i>

929
01:47:18.058 --> 01:47:21.728
<i>And before the holy-most
moment is upon us,</i>

930
01:47:21.811 --> 01:47:25.523
<i>let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.</i>

931
01:47:28.526 --> 01:47:31.780
<i>And let's get this tub of shit
up to speed.</i>

932
01:47:38.328 --> 01:47:39.412
Yeah.

933
01:48:17.951 --> 01:48:19.619
Pull!

934
01:48:19.703 --> 01:48:22.831
Pull!

935
01:48:22.914 --> 01:48:25.083
- Pull.
- Pull!

936
01:48:44.811 --> 01:48:48.106
- So which way we rowing?
- I don't have a goddamn clue.

937
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:49.941
Don't worry.

938
01:48:49.983 --> 01:48:53.153
They'll row for a month before
they figure out I'm faking it.

939
01:48:53.236 --> 01:48:56.031
But why?

940
01:48:56.114 --> 01:48:57.615
Oh, you want details.

941
01:48:57.699 --> 01:48:59.117
Well, I'm not telling these savages

942
01:48:59.159 --> 01:49:01.369
that we haven't solved the map yet.

943
01:49:01.453 --> 01:49:02.829
I promised them results,

944
01:49:02.912 --> 01:49:06.499
and I'll get them if I gotta cut them
out of her goddamn back.

945
01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:11.629
Who is that? Who is that?

946
01:49:13.173 --> 01:49:15.633
Maybe one of the spare rowers?

947
01:49:23.308 --> 01:49:25.226
<i>Why aren't you rowing?</i>

948
01:49:34.652 --> 01:49:36.821
- It's him.
- It is him.

949
01:49:38.031 --> 01:49:40.200
You guys are in so much trouble.

950
01:49:43.578 --> 01:49:46.790
<i>Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.</i>

951
01:49:47.999 --> 01:49:50.543
<i>You know,
he's like a turd that won't flush.</i>

952
01:49:51.711 --> 01:49:53.129
I want the girl.

953
01:49:57.050 --> 01:50:01.721
<i>You know,
I thought you were stupid, friend.</i>

954
01:50:02.847 --> 01:50:05.225
<i>But I underestimated you.</i>

955
01:50:05.308 --> 01:50:08.603
<i>You're a total freaking retard.</i>

956
01:50:11.523 --> 01:50:15.235
I want the girl. That's all.

957
01:50:15.318 --> 01:50:19.364
<i>Well, what on this screwed-up earth
makes you think you're gonna get her?</i>

958
01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:29.415
You know what this is?

959
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:36.714
I drop it, you burn.

960
01:50:37.048 --> 01:50:40.552
- We all burn.
- <i>Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

961
01:50:41.928 --> 01:50:44.556
<i>Let's not do anything rash here.</i>

962
01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:47.183
<i>I mean, are you sure
she's worth all this?</i>

963
01:50:47.225 --> 01:50:50.395
<i>She never does stop talking.
She never shuts up.</i>

964
01:50:51.146 --> 01:50:54.232
- I noticed.
- <i>What is it, then?</i>

965
01:50:54.816 --> 01:50:56.276
<i>It's the map.</i>

966
01:50:57.235 --> 01:50:58.570
She's my friend.

967
01:51:00.029 --> 01:51:03.074
<i>Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.</i>

968
01:51:03.116 --> 01:51:05.577
<i>I mean, you're gonna die for your friend?</i>

969
01:51:07.453 --> 01:51:08.955
If it comes to that.

970
01:51:11.332 --> 01:51:13.168
He's bluffing. I'll kill him.

971
01:51:13.251 --> 01:51:15.420
He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

972
01:51:15.503 --> 01:51:16.796
Shut up!

973
01:51:19.174 --> 01:51:22.969
<i>I don't think you're gonna drop
that torch, my friend.</i>

974
01:51:23.845 --> 01:51:27.056
- Why not?
- <i>Because you're not crazy.</i>

975
01:51:30.935 --> 01:51:32.687
<i>No!</i>

976
01:51:40.445 --> 01:51:42.155
Oh, thank God.

977
01:52:00.965 --> 01:52:02.884
Look out!

978
01:52:02.967 --> 01:52:04.385
That's him!

979
01:52:05.595 --> 01:52:07.513
Let's go, God damn it!

980
01:52:10.975 --> 01:52:13.811
Don't just stand there!
Kill something!

981
01:52:16.856 --> 01:52:18.608
Was this your big vision?

982
01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:31.120
I've always wanted
to drive this monster.

983
01:52:34.499 --> 01:52:36.834
There he is! There he is!

984
01:52:41.005 --> 01:52:42.757
That's him! There!

985
01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:59.357
Let me go! Let go!

986
01:53:09.826 --> 01:53:10.952
Let go!

987
01:53:15.415 --> 01:53:18.209
- Let me go! Let go!
- Pilot!

988
01:53:18.251 --> 01:53:20.378
- Pilot!
- Let me go!

989
01:53:20.461 --> 01:53:22.130
Let go!

990
01:53:22.213 --> 01:53:24.716
Let go!

991
01:53:27.552 --> 01:53:30.555
You should've stayed underwater.

992
01:53:39.814 --> 01:53:43.568
Now, you know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

993
01:53:44.736 --> 01:53:47.238
Now, you stop it!
You behave yourself, now!

994
01:55:19.705 --> 01:55:21.374
It's going down.

995
01:55:21.457 --> 01:55:26.003
- You can see it sinking.
- Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.

996
01:55:26.504 --> 01:55:28.589
- Hurry, Gregor!
- Don't worry.

997
01:55:28.673 --> 01:55:29.674
Hurry.

998
01:55:43.813 --> 01:55:46.065
Enola! Up here!

999
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:47.442
Grab on!

1000
01:55:52.905 --> 01:55:54.657
Are they on yet?

1001
01:55:58.286 --> 01:56:00.496
- What is it?
- I don't know!

1002
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:16.762
Got you! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out.

1003
01:56:32.111 --> 01:56:34.155
Pull! Almost.

1004
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:17.323
- No! Enola!
- No!

1005
01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:21.827
Saint Joe. Hole in one.

1006
01:57:21.911 --> 01:57:22.995
Helen!

1007
01:57:23.079 --> 01:57:24.664
No! Enola!

1008
01:57:24.914 --> 01:57:26.207
Helen!

1009
01:57:26.624 --> 01:57:28.626
Hey! Hey!

1010
01:57:35.299 --> 01:57:38.594
Oh, no! Quick!
What are we gonna do?

1011
01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:43.766
Tie this off.

1012
01:57:48.521 --> 01:57:50.481
Hurry! Tie it!

1013
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:57.238
Got it!

1014
01:58:11.377 --> 01:58:12.753
Get them up now.

1015
01:58:24.432 --> 01:58:27.143
- Of course! North is south.
- What?

1016
01:58:27.184 --> 01:58:28.352
South is north.

1017
01:58:28.394 --> 01:58:29.687
I was swimming.

1018
01:58:30.688 --> 01:58:32.940
- I saw.
- My friends.

1019
01:58:33.024 --> 01:58:34.984
My friends, look.

1020
01:58:35.026 --> 01:58:36.819
If I take a bearing from the sun

1021
01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:39.697
and reverse the coordinates
on Enola's back,

1022
01:58:41.949 --> 01:58:44.035
then Dryland is that way!

1023
02:00:48.409 --> 02:00:49.744
It's fresh!

1024
02:00:49.827 --> 02:00:52.496
All of this! It's fresh!

1025
02:01:08.387 --> 02:01:10.347
I found something!

1026
02:01:23.652 --> 02:01:26.030
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1027
02:01:27.198 --> 02:01:28.949
I think it was their way.

1028
02:01:31.368 --> 02:01:33.496
They must have known they were dying.

1029
02:02:04.193 --> 02:02:05.486
I'm home.

1030
02:02:16.956 --> 02:02:19.583
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1031
02:02:24.755 --> 02:02:27.466
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.

1032
02:03:40.164 --> 02:03:42.833
First time in your life
you got nothing to say?

1033
02:03:57.348 --> 02:03:59.058
Enola, I have to go now.

1034
02:04:00.225 --> 02:04:01.977
But you came back for me.

1035
02:04:04.063 --> 02:04:05.356
I like you.

1036
02:04:11.070 --> 02:04:12.696
Why are you leaving?

1037
02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.870
- I don't belong here. I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1038
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:25.417
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1039
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:29.088
Helen said that it's only landsickness.

1040
02:04:29.964 --> 02:04:32.841
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

1041
02:04:33.676 --> 02:04:35.219
It's more than that.
