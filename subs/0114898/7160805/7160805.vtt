(Narrator) 'The future.

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:47.298
'The polar ice caps have melted,

'Those who survived

'have adapted to a new world.'

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:22.727
Ah!

7
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.732

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.077

12
00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:13.105
(Speaking PortuGreek)

13
00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:27.495
Bad luck, English.

14
00:05:28.746 --> 00:05:32.750
But the Slavers are producing
a good grade epoxy these days.

15
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.129
Cost you a handful of dirt
or maybe that wind chime.

16
00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:40.258
- What are you doing here?
- Just waiting.

17
00:05:40.383 --> 00:05:42.426
Take your hand off the sail.

18
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.346
Take it off!

19
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:49.851
I've seen your boat before.
Haven't seen you.

20
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:52.019
Took it legal.

21
00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:57.650
The previous owner was dead
on the tiller when I found it.

22
00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:00.736
You had another hour
before I traded up again.

23
00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:05.116
- Just improving my means.
- Well, I owe you, then.

24
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.703
No, thanks. I got all the supplies I need.

25
00:06:08.828 --> 00:06:11.038
Just came from an atoll.

26
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:14.417
Eight days east, if you are interested.

27
00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:18.796
Two Drifters meet.
Something needs to be exchanged.

28
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:23.009
I know the code,
but I'll give you this one for free.

29
00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:26.512
Nothing's free in Waterworld.

30
00:06:26.637 --> 00:06:27.972
(Chuckles) Yeah.

31
00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.359
Smokers.

32
00:06:41.903 --> 00:06:43.863
Just enough wind to get away clean.

33
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.785
(Drifter) Forget the bag!

34
00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:57.627
It's not worth it.
You'll never make it with your sails down.

35
00:06:57.752 --> 00:06:58.753
Hey!

36
00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:01.297
Ha-ha-ha!

37
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:14.310
What can I say?

38
00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:35.998
Joe, he's going for it.

39
00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:37.833
What the hell...?

40
00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:44.924
Never seen that before.

41
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.972
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!

42
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.853
Faster! Faster!

43
00:07:57.979 --> 00:07:59.063
Whoo!

44
00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:22.211
Come on! He's gonna get it!

45
00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:44.150
- Go!
- Get him! Get him!

46
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.287
(Chuckles)

47
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:15.014
No!

48
00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:17.516
No! Argh!

49
00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:24.023
(Smokers yell)

50
00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:28.069
- (Gunfire)
- Argh!

51
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.072
(Drifter cries out)

52
00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:03.771
(Shouts in PortuGreek)

53
00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:07.733
(Exchange in PortuGreek)

54
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:11.278
(Old man) Do you want keep these hair?

55
00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:16.242
Do you want keep these hair?
Take small hydro. Small cup hydro.

56
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:21.122
How many ways can I say it?
Go on, hit the swell.

57
00:10:21.247 --> 00:10:26.001
Do you want keep these hair?
Take small hydro.

58
00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:29.380
What do you think?
He does have a bush on him.

59
00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:32.424
Do a side barter if you want,
but don't open the gates.

60
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.804
(Old man) Small cup hydro!
Do you want keep these hairs?

61
00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:39.765
Inbound! Straight out.

62
00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:02.079
InglÃªs!

63
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.837
Flags down, Drifter.
We've got enough traders.

64
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.761
(Murmuring)

65
00:11:17.887 --> 00:11:20.931
- (Woman) What does he have?
- (Man) What's he got?

66
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:24.935
Dirt!

67
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:28.022
(Man) Open the gates!

68
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:25.955
(Chattering)

69
00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:31.669
(Elder)
Bones to berries, veins to vine.

70
00:12:31.794 --> 00:12:35.965
These tendons to trees,
this blood to brine.

71
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.302
Too old she was.
This woman does leave us,

72
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:44.306
recycled and enshrined
in the presence of him who leads us.

73
00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:57.069
(Children chattering)

74
00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:05.160
My eyes! That hurts!

75
00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.871
(Child) What is that?

76
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:13.711
You know me?

77
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:17.548
- I know what you are.
- Good.

78
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:21.176
Then you know
if you look for trouble here,

79
00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:25.597
you'll find more than you can handle.
You've got two hours.

80
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.186
I'll only need one.

81
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.491
He's coming over here.

82
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.332
- Me!
- You each get one

83
00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:53.834
if everything's here when I get back.

84
00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:59.965
(Man) Look at that.

85
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:04.845
- Pure dirt.
- (Gasps)

86
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:05.971
3.2 kilos.

87
00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.643
How d'you come by so much of it?

88
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:15.022
Another atoll 30 horizons west of here.

89
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:18.859
- Where'd they get it?
- They didn't say.

90
00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:22.946
(Man) We heard about that place.
Heard they was all killed.

91
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.159
- That's why they didn't say.
- Smokers?

92
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:30.496
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.

93
00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:34.708
So what's it worth? We trading or not?

94
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.044
We'll tally it like...

95
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.047
pure hydro.

96
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.053
Works out to...62 chits.

97
00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:51.934
- I want twice that.
- (People gasp)

98
00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.274
You drive a hard bargain.

99
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.795
Dirt?

100
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.341
I have never seen purer.

101
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:29.555
- I just want one sip of hydro.
- No, not till you tell me.

102
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.975
She's got inkings on her back. I seen her.

103
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.645
They say if you read the marks
on the child,

104
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.731
they'll lead you all the way to Dryland.

105
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:42.860
- Dryland's a myth.
- Aw, some still believe.

106
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:46.196
They say the Smokers even got
an eye out for her.

107
00:15:47.573 --> 00:15:51.076
Well, then,
we better keep it to ourselves.

108
00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:27.112
- Help you?
- Yeah.

109
00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.032
- Where's the store?
- You found it.

110
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:38.123
You don't have much.

111
00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.168
You the man with the dirt?

112
00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:46.924
I'll take the hydro. All six Gs.

113
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:54.973
Got any canvas? Line?

114
00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.102
I've got line. It's hair. No canvas.

115
00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:01.313
I'll take the line.

116
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.066
- Any seeds?
- Nope.

117
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.402
- Wood?
- No.

118
00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:11.865
Magazines?

119
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.117
If I had a magazine,

120
00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.578
I'd retire.

121
00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:28.966
Something to drink?

122
00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.135
A cup of hydro.

123
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.148
Pure.

124
00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:05.877
<i>Skol.</i>

125
00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:12.092
- One more.
- Make it two.

126
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:15.804
A man this rich will buy
for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.

127
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.306
One.

128
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.146
That's an interesting pair of boots
you've got.

129
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.857
- Trade?
- No.

130
00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:29.651
So how long you been out there, man?

131
00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.783
Don't hurt asking. Talking costs nothing.

132
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:48.629
- Depends. What lunar is it?
- Well, let's see.

133
00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:51.965
April, March, June. It's August.

134
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.635
- This August?
- Yep.

135
00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:57.054
So how long?

136
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.434
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen lunars?

137
00:19:08.899 --> 00:19:10.067
(Whispers) That's her.

138
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:12.653
Enola, hey, what are you doing?

139
00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.864
- No, you can't have that.
- I need another piece to draw some more.

140
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:20.243
I'll get it. I'll give it to you.
Just stay in the back.

141
00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:25.123
With all those chits,
you could order up a bath.

142
00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:28.877
- Why are you talking to me?
- Just being friendly.

143
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.843
- Is that a tomato plant?
- Yeah.

144
00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:41.264
- You have a keen eye.
- I saw one in a picture. How much?

145
00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.439
Half your chits.

146
00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:05.205
- I'll take them, too.
- Take what? You bought everything.

147
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.207
I'll take them shelves.

148
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:13.296
So, what did you see out there
in your 15 months?

149
00:20:13.422 --> 00:20:15.716
- Such as?
- An end to all this water.

150
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:18.135
You're asking the wrong person.

151
00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:21.430
- The one they buried today.
- Uh-huh?

152
00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:23.765
She found the only end there is.

153
00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:31.106
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.

154
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.108
I'm not bargaining. I'm leaving.

155
00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.236
But you haven't even heard anything yet.
Or seen it.

156
00:20:40.282 --> 00:20:45.662
You may have noticed us burying a citizen
today. That makes room for one more.

157
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.458
I'm not staying.

158
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.544
Oh, we're not asking you to.
All we want is your seed.

159
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:56.715
(Man) We can look to our own
for impregnation,

160
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.803
but too much of that sort of thing gets...
undesirable.

161
00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:07.017
When she's pregnant, you go on your way
with all the supplies you need.

162
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:11.229
You don't have anything. You're dying.

163
00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:20.489
No man stays out that long
and turns down a woman.

164
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.658
He's hiding something.

165
00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:26.077
Maybe he's a Smoker spy.

166
00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:29.539
(Whistles)

167
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:40.801
When the Elders say so, you can leave.
And not before.

168
00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:01.696
Ah. Gills.

169
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:06.868
- Mutation!
- He's a Muto!

170
00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:11.206
(Grunting)

171
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:15.585
Aaargh!

172
00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.257
(Man) Get him!

173
00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:27.264
(Man) Throw the nets!

174
00:22:46.283 --> 00:22:47.993
(Yelling)

175
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.124
(Man) He's a murderer!

176
00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:59.129
Aargh!

177
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.757
By what right?

178
00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:06.344
You pay me to keep the peace.

179
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:10.974
- This isn't it.
- No! He has killed one of us.

180
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:13.727
- He was defending himself.
- He needs to be destroyed!

181
00:23:13.852 --> 00:23:15.854
- Kill him!
- That may be.

182
00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:19.941
- Kill him!
- But not here, and not like this.

183
00:23:21.693 --> 00:23:23.737
(Metal gears turning)

184
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.683
(Boy) What is it?

185
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.769
Hey!

186
00:23:56.978 --> 00:24:00.148
(Man) Too tight! I can't get it off.

187
00:24:03.818 --> 00:24:05.195
(Man) Open the gate!

188
00:24:09.199 --> 00:24:10.867
(Chuckling)

189
00:24:25.215 --> 00:24:27.217
(People arguing)

190
00:24:28.218 --> 00:24:29.844
(Man) Order!

191
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.555
This is another device we found
on the boat.

192
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:36.977
A garrote cord for strangulation!

193
00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:41.523
We, we don't know what this is all about,

194
00:24:41.648 --> 00:24:46.611
but we believe it to be
some sort of torturing device!

195
00:24:48.405 --> 00:24:51.658
And this - this is a spy tool!

196
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.537
For listening to the unsuspecting!

197
00:24:58.248 --> 00:25:01.084
The evidence speaks for itself.

198
00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:06.548
I move that we dispense with the Muto
as soon as possible and...

199
00:25:06.673 --> 00:25:08.133
(Helen) Why?

200
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.220
Why not use him?

201
00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:16.558
Because he is a threat to the safety
and the purity of this atoll.

202
00:25:16.683 --> 00:25:19.853
- He is not a threat. He's in a cage.
- He killed one of ours, Helen.

203
00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:22.397
(Shouts of agreement)

204
00:25:22.522 --> 00:25:26.693
- Is he dangerous or not?
- I'd say he is now.

205
00:25:27.694 --> 00:25:30.321
But he came in here with all this dirt,

206
00:25:30.447 --> 00:25:33.533
the likes of which we haven't seen
since Enola came.

207
00:25:33.658 --> 00:25:36.327
Oh, what about it?

208
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.372
So it had to come from somewhere.

209
00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:44.627
- What if it came from Dryland?
- Ah, don't start!

210
00:25:44.753 --> 00:25:46.796
He came from the west, I can tell you.

211
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:50.008
Smokers come from there, from the west.

212
00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.635
But if he is a spy,

213
00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:57.265
this ichthy man will give away
our position, our weaknesses.

214
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.850
And if he isn't?

215
00:25:58.975 --> 00:26:03.063
He is still a Muto and he could
contaminate our community!

216
00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:05.982
- And others!
- What others?

217
00:26:06.107 --> 00:26:08.610
We haven't seen another atoll
in over a year.

218
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:13.156
- Let's keep to the issue at hand.
- No, this is the issue at hand.

219
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:16.242
Every year, every month, it gets worse.

220
00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:20.080
There are fewer atollers, fewer traders.

221
00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:22.248
Dead gardens,

222
00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:25.251
these windmills that don't work.

223
00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:28.338
Desalinators that can't be fixed.

224
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:31.257
This place,

225
00:26:31.382 --> 00:26:34.552
this whole way of living, it's ending.

226
00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:39.516
- Doesn't anyone else see that?
- When I was a boy, we had lots of atolls.

227
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:44.437
You keep on praying for help and now
one man comes here who might actually...

228
00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:48.566
- He's not a man!
- It doesn't matter what he is!

229
00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:54.239
I say, if he knows the way to Dryland,
make him show us where it is!

230
00:26:54.364 --> 00:26:57.408
People have looked for centuries
and death is all they found.

231
00:26:57.534 --> 00:27:00.370
- At least they died trying!
- It's a hoax!

232
00:27:00.495 --> 00:27:05.083
The sooner you realize that, Helen,
the better off we're all going to be!

233
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:09.129
We'd be better off if we got rid
of that girl of hers, too.

234
00:27:09.254 --> 00:27:10.880
(Man) Right!

235
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:14.676
Smokers are looking for her!
I heard it from a trader.

236
00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:19.597
- (Bangs gavel)
- One matter at a time!

237
00:27:19.722 --> 00:27:22.392
I say get rid of both of them!

238
00:27:22.517 --> 00:27:25.645
- The Muto and the girl!
- Yes!

239
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.899
- (Clamor)
- Yes! Kill them!

240
00:27:30.024 --> 00:27:31.442
Order!

241
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.242
(Humming)

242
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:49.252
(Footsteps approach)

243
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.423
(Sniggering)

244
00:27:53.548 --> 00:27:55.550
You'd like this, wouldn't you?

245
00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:59.137
- Stick him.
- He sure is quieter than he was.

246
00:27:59.262 --> 00:28:02.807
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Stick him again.

247
00:28:02.932 --> 00:28:07.604
I know you want it. I know -
maybe he don't eat his own kind.

248
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:08.897
Aaaargh!

249
00:28:26.247 --> 00:28:29.125
(Gregor) Aha! That's it!

250
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.048
A-ha-ha! That's it!
Don't move, my dear!

251
00:28:35.173 --> 00:28:39.010
Polaris to Taurus.
I forgot Taurus, the bull.

252
00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:41.554
In the shoulder of the bull

253
00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:44.807
there's six sisters.
Or seven, but you can only see six.

254
00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:49.479
At the beginning of each lunar,
one sister is lined up with Scorpius!

255
00:28:49.604 --> 00:28:54.817
And Scorpius has a tail just like an arrow
on the circle on the back of the child!

256
00:28:54.943 --> 00:28:59.197
If I take into account the seventh sister,
and give the seventh sister a lunar,

257
00:28:59.322 --> 00:29:02.659
that lunar would run perpendicular
to Scorpius,

258
00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:05.703
creating a horizon, a straight line,

259
00:29:05.828 --> 00:29:09.332
that would run directly...
directly toward...

260
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.585
Dryland?

261
00:29:14.504 --> 00:29:15.505
No.

262
00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:20.635
(Screams) Is it a map?

263
00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:23.638
Is it calendar?

264
00:29:27.475 --> 00:29:30.061
Is it symbols? Is it language?

265
00:29:30.186 --> 00:29:33.773
- You'd tell me if you knew, eh, Enola?
- Mm-hm.

266
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.196
- What are you drawing?
- I don't know.

267
00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:45.952
Helen, look. Look at
the prodigal child's latest vision.

268
00:29:48.788 --> 00:29:50.623
(He chuckles)

269
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:54.085
We've got to get out of here.

270
00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:59.590
- I take it the meeting didn't go well.
- They're cutting us adrift, Gregor.

271
00:29:59.716 --> 00:30:03.594
No, they'll not hurt you.
I'd turn their lights off if they did.

272
00:30:04.554 --> 00:30:06.556
How soon before we can go?

273
00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:08.891
Another week, ideally.

274
00:30:09.017 --> 00:30:11.019
We don't have a week.

275
00:30:11.144 --> 00:30:15.064
Helen, I don't have any idea yet
where we can go.

276
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:18.192
Try. Try it once again.

277
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:23.156
There's nothing in them.
I've been through the books.

278
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:28.786
There's nothing in these books.
She is the annunciation. I know it.

279
00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.913
I just don't know how.

280
00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:36.753
I'm a stupid man.
The answer's right there. It's...

281
00:30:36.878 --> 00:30:38.880
It's just beyond me.

282
00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:43.885
Maybe he knows.

283
00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:58.232
Ah, yes, I see.

284
00:30:58.358 --> 00:31:00.193
They are webbed.

285
00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:04.614
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.

286
00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:08.743
They tell me, too, that you have gills.
Isotropic gills.

287
00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:11.120
Are they merely vestigial or functional?

288
00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:16.167
My name is Gregor. I've just come
to pay you a little vi...vi...

289
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.670
Oh, my God.

290
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:24.801
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited.

291
00:31:24.926 --> 00:31:29.514
Your gills, they are functional. Ichthys
sapien. You can breathe in the water.

292
00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:31.933
How deep can you go?

293
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:37.188
Look, I'm only here because I want
to learn more about you.

294
00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.898
(Mariner spits)

295
00:31:42.276 --> 00:31:45.446
You don't like humans very much, do you?

296
00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:48.116
I can't say that I blame you.

297
00:31:48.241 --> 00:31:51.536
But, tell me, are all of your kind
as bad-tempered as you?

298
00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:58.000
- I have no kind.
- Oh, fish rot.

299
00:31:58.126 --> 00:32:02.839
I'd be surprised if there weren't others.
If there aren't, there will be eventually.

300
00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:08.886
Anyway, I come here
because I need to ask you a question.

301
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:13.724
Where... Where did your dirt come from?
Is it from Dryland?

302
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:17.061
Do you know what this is?

303
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:22.900
The Ancients, they did something terrible,
didn't they? To cause all this water.

304
00:32:23.025 --> 00:32:27.280
- Hundreds, hundreds of years ago.
- If I tell you, will you open this lock?

305
00:32:30.658 --> 00:32:32.869
I haven't a key.

306
00:32:33.744 --> 00:32:36.539
- There's a mooring cleat down there.
- What?

307
00:32:36.664 --> 00:32:39.667
- As good as any key.
- A mooring cleat?

308
00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:44.505
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.

309
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.093
- I'll be right back.
- (Man) Gregor!

310
00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:53.764
- What's your business there? Move along!
- I'm not a brave man.

311
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.727
If you know anything about Dryland,
please, tell me.

312
00:32:57.852 --> 00:33:00.980
Please. Don't let it die with you.

313
00:33:01.105 --> 00:33:02.690
No, no, no.

314
00:33:02.815 --> 00:33:03.983
Stop!

315
00:33:04.108 --> 00:33:05.818
(Man) Gregor?

316
00:33:05.943 --> 00:33:07.778
Move along!

317
00:33:21.584 --> 00:33:23.794
(Smokers howl like wolves)

318
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.762
(Bell tolls)

319
00:34:07.964 --> 00:34:10.383
- Get out of the way!
- Oh!

320
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:21.102
(Elder) After considerable deliberation
of the evidence at hand,

321
00:34:21.936 --> 00:34:27.066
it is our decision that this Muto
does indeed constitute a threat.

322
00:34:27.191 --> 00:34:31.320
Therefore,
in the interest of public safety,

323
00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:34.657
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled

324
00:34:34.782 --> 00:34:37.243
in the customary fashion.

325
00:34:37.368 --> 00:34:38.661
Proceed.

326
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.631
I'm sorry.

327
00:34:59.098 --> 00:35:02.393
Bones to berries, veins to vines,

328
00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:07.898
these tendons to trees,
this blood to brine.

329
00:35:08.024 --> 00:35:10.610
Too strange for life he was,

330
00:35:10.735 --> 00:35:15.156
this Muto now does leave us,

331
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:17.533
recycled and entombed,

332
00:35:17.658 --> 00:35:21.579
in the presence of him who leads us...

333
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:33.341
Smokers!

334
00:35:33.466 --> 00:35:36.052
Dead out of the sun!

335
00:35:39.305 --> 00:35:42.224
To your posts!

336
00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:57.365
(Alarmed yelling)

337
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.575
(Woman) Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

338
00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:15.758
Kill!

339
00:36:15.883 --> 00:36:17.385
There!

340
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.553
Aaah! Aaah!

341
00:36:25.101 --> 00:36:27.311
Get to your posts!

342
00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:30.439
We are safe, behind this wall!

343
00:36:31.649 --> 00:36:33.734
Aren't we?

344
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.912
Let me out! Let me out! I'll fight!

345
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.632
Get those bullets loaded!

346
00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:08.561
- I can't find my dad.
- He's probably on the wall.

347
00:37:08.686 --> 00:37:11.897
Go in, get a weapon and fight! Go now! Go!
Go, go!

348
00:37:29.248 --> 00:37:31.250
Give me the key to the city now.

349
00:37:34.628 --> 00:37:37.339
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

350
00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:42.970
Floor it! Floor it! Go on!

351
00:37:59.028 --> 00:38:00.738
(Woman screaming)

352
00:38:04.283 --> 00:38:06.577
Swab it! Swab it!

353
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:10.331
Hurry them up!

354
00:38:38.526 --> 00:38:40.528
Burn down the door!

355
00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:46.033
Burn it down!

356
00:38:46.158 --> 00:38:47.409
Aargh!

357
00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:02.967
We'll have this atoll in no time.

358
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.514
Crank it! Crank it!

359
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:13.394
Look!

360
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:27.992
(Yelling)

361
00:39:33.247 --> 00:39:35.416
- Now!
- Aaaah!

362
00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:00.107
(Screams)

363
00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:10.659
Oh, no!

364
00:40:34.934 --> 00:40:35.935
Oh, my...!

365
00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:40.856
Helen!

366
00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:45.319
Keep that gas going! Fill 'em up!

367
00:40:56.747 --> 00:40:58.749
Aaargh!

368
00:41:23.607 --> 00:41:24.900
Aargh!

369
00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:29.446
It's the girl they want!
Give them Enola and they'll leave!

370
00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:33.659
Come quickly! Helen!

371
00:41:46.213 --> 00:41:48.549
Aah! Aaargh!

372
00:42:08.777 --> 00:42:13.615
You're not supposed to go yet!
Infernal machine!

373
00:42:15.784 --> 00:42:17.661
Damn you!

374
00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:27.963
Infernal machine!

375
00:42:31.508 --> 00:42:34.136
Gregor? Gregor! Wait!

376
00:42:34.261 --> 00:42:37.639
Helen, I tried. There was an accident.
I couldn't make it stop. Hurry!

377
00:42:37.765 --> 00:42:41.143
You can make it if you try!
Up those stairs! Run!

378
00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:44.229
- Wait!
- Quickly! I'll throw you a rope!

379
00:42:44.354 --> 00:42:47.483
- Run quickly!
- Throw the rope now!

380
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:50.319
Throw the rope! No!

381
00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:52.529
- No!
- Wait!

382
00:42:54.656 --> 00:42:56.241
- Don't leave us!
- No!

383
00:42:56.366 --> 00:42:58.535
I'm sorry! It was an accident!

384
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:04.374
Helen!

385
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.710
Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!

386
00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:28.774
Shoot him. Shoot him.

387
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:39.201
Aaargh!

388
00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:59.304
If I let you out of here,
you're taking us with you.

389
00:44:00.264 --> 00:44:01.265
Sure.

390
00:44:04.893 --> 00:44:06.937
Enola, get down.

391
00:44:07.938 --> 00:44:09.982
Come here. Get down.

392
00:44:10.107 --> 00:44:12.109
Hurry! Come on!

393
00:44:15.154 --> 00:44:16.363
Get the gate!

394
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.683
Argh!

395
00:45:06.496 --> 00:45:07.623
Argh!

396
00:45:16.465 --> 00:45:18.300
(Mariner) Hurry up!

397
00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:20.260
Kamikaze! Come on!

398
00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:50.958
That made a hole.

399
00:46:09.142 --> 00:46:11.645
Find her! Get the girl!

400
00:46:16.775 --> 00:46:17.818
There!

401
00:46:25.826 --> 00:46:29.037
Go! Get that guy! Go! Kill him!

402
00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:35.585
- Wow!
- Enola!

403
00:46:45.929 --> 00:46:49.016
- You're too slow!
- Run to the other side.

404
00:46:50.934 --> 00:46:52.269
Come on!

405
00:46:58.275 --> 00:47:01.320
Grab on! Hold on, hold on.

406
00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:08.952
It's stuck! I can't make it through!
Let her go!

407
00:47:10.412 --> 00:47:13.415
- (Bullets fly)
- Just drop her!

408
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.265
Turn the wheel! The wheel! Turn it.

409
00:47:34.936 --> 00:47:36.396
That!

410
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.066
- Come on, push it!
- I am!

411
00:47:39.191 --> 00:47:41.485
Hurry! Push it hard!

412
00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.653
Push it hard!

413
00:47:43.779 --> 00:47:45.739
OK, OK!

414
00:47:45.864 --> 00:47:49.201
Now pull it! Pull it! Go! Go!

415
00:47:49.326 --> 00:47:51.161
Pull it!

416
00:48:02.798 --> 00:48:05.842
- Enola, jump.
- (Bullets hit hull)

417
00:48:06.843 --> 00:48:09.346
- Just look at me! Jump!
- OK!

418
00:48:25.904 --> 00:48:27.823
Well, excuse me!

419
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:31.952
Did I say anybody could leave
before the battle was over? Did I?

420
00:48:32.077 --> 00:48:35.455
- No!
- Well, do something! I hate sails.

421
00:48:44.798 --> 00:48:46.258
Hey!

422
00:48:46.383 --> 00:48:50.095
- Can you steer?
- Can I trust you?

423
00:49:24.546 --> 00:49:28.550
Answer me this, somebody.
Why is that boat still firing?

424
00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:31.803
- What's that cousin's name?
- Chuck.

425
00:49:31.928 --> 00:49:35.098
- Hey, Chuck!
- He's pulling him right into us!

426
00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:39.561
Maybe he doesn't answer to Chuck.
Call him Charles. Charles!

427
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:45.775
- Stop him! Stop him!
- (Machine gun roars)

428
00:49:50.447 --> 00:49:52.240
(Men cry out)

429
00:49:53.283 --> 00:49:54.284
Charles!

430
00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:59.289
Adios, cousins.

431
00:50:37.285 --> 00:50:40.664
(Woman) Put me down! Put me down!

432
00:50:51.424 --> 00:50:53.593
She's here somewhere. Keep looking!

433
00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:02.227
(Chainsaw buzzes)

434
00:51:06.606 --> 00:51:07.607
Ah!

435
00:51:09.943 --> 00:51:11.778
(Stammers)

436
00:51:11.903 --> 00:51:15.073
660 Gs of hydro,
three-quarter grade or better,

437
00:51:15.198 --> 00:51:19.119
120 keys of assorted edibles -
fish and plankton cakes -

438
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:22.622
and 60 keys lamp oil,
44 old-grow grapevines,

439
00:51:22.747 --> 00:51:24.833
ten assorted fruit trees,

440
00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:29.379
zero reloads - no ammo storage
on this particular atoll.

441
00:51:29.504 --> 00:51:33.592
Uh, zero go-juice.
No refining capability.

442
00:51:33.717 --> 00:51:35.552
Primitive savages!

443
00:51:37.262 --> 00:51:39.973
Oh... How about smokes?

444
00:51:40.098 --> 00:51:42.267
Uh, zero. Zero smokes.

445
00:51:43.852 --> 00:51:46.438
I remember when this used to be fun.

446
00:51:46.563 --> 00:51:49.524
How long since we had
a really good crusade?

447
00:51:49.649 --> 00:51:53.278
- I know, I know.
- Tell me, how long?

448
00:51:53.403 --> 00:51:55.405
- I don't know...
- Remember,

449
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.742
there used to be atolls on every horizon.

450
00:51:58.867 --> 00:51:59.868
Mm-hm.

451
00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:03.747
Where the hell are they all going?

452
00:52:03.872 --> 00:52:05.874
Well, we sunk a few.

453
00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:10.337
- I found this.
- Nord... Oh, now that's warmer.

454
00:52:10.462 --> 00:52:14.966
- All right. And the girl?
- Not here. She might have gotten away.

455
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:18.720
That's why we came here!
We didn't come here to practice!

456
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:20.805
We don't need practice!

457
00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:28.813
- What you got?
- A couple of heartbeats.

458
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.940
Aren't saying much.

459
00:52:32.275 --> 00:52:36.446
If you notice the arterial nature
of the blood from the hole in my head,

460
00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:40.533
you can assume we're all having
a real lousy day.

461
00:52:40.659 --> 00:52:44.663
So here it is. I need to know
about that tattooed girl.

462
00:52:46.081 --> 00:52:50.710
- First one that tells me lives.
- I saw a girl! I saw her!

463
00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:52.837
She had a big tattoo on her.

464
00:52:55.507 --> 00:52:57.342
You won. Start over.

465
00:52:58.468 --> 00:53:00.553
I-I saw a girl. I'm not sure,

466
00:53:00.679 --> 00:53:04.432
but I think she got on that boat
with three hulls.

467
00:53:05.475 --> 00:53:08.436
The boat that cost me a thousand Gs
of go-juice?

468
00:53:08.561 --> 00:53:11.064
- The Muto's boat.
- Muto?

469
00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:13.942
Yeah, he's got these slits here,

470
00:53:14.067 --> 00:53:17.404
like...like fish gills.

471
00:53:17.529 --> 00:53:19.739
He wasn't really a man.

472
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:22.450
A fluke of evolution!

473
00:53:24.035 --> 00:53:26.413
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of...

474
00:53:26.538 --> 00:53:28.707
- Evolution.
- I know!

475
00:53:28.832 --> 00:53:31.292
Let's have an intelligent conversation.

476
00:53:31.418 --> 00:53:34.504
I'll talk and you listen.

477
00:53:34.629 --> 00:53:38.633
In the beginning,
the provider said,

478
00:53:38.758 --> 00:53:42.429
"Let there be water!"
and the seas came forth.

479
00:53:42.554 --> 00:53:47.183
- He created everything that we know...
- Hey, hey! The Deacon!

480
00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:49.227
The air that we breathe!

481
00:53:49.352 --> 00:53:52.313
He made also both man and fish

482
00:53:52.439 --> 00:53:55.150
and no combination thereof!

483
00:53:55.275 --> 00:53:58.987
He does not abide the notion of evolution!

484
00:53:59.112 --> 00:54:00.905
Amen!

485
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:06.619
- No! You said you wouldn't kill me!
- Did I say that? Witnesses? Anybody?

486
00:54:06.745 --> 00:54:10.248
- Yes, yes, yes, you did.
- Ah, I may have!

487
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.461
I may have.

488
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.255
No!

489
00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:23.470
We get to the 'Dez,

490
00:54:24.763 --> 00:54:28.558
take up that sky boat,
send it out on patrol.

491
00:54:29.184 --> 00:54:34.439
We got to keep an eye out
for that ichthy freak!

492
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.122
I know what you're thinking.

493
00:55:33.248 --> 00:55:38.378
How much longer that hydro would last
if there weren't three of us on this boat.

494
00:55:40.505 --> 00:55:43.132
Well, Enola won't drink much.

495
00:55:44.509 --> 00:55:46.553
And I won't...

496
00:55:47.262 --> 00:55:49.264
I won't drink at all.

497
00:55:49.389 --> 00:55:51.558
Not till we get there.

498
00:55:51.683 --> 00:55:53.810
Get where?

499
00:55:53.935 --> 00:55:55.937
Wherever you're going.

500
00:55:57.272 --> 00:55:59.274
Wherever you got your dirt.

501
00:56:00.733 --> 00:56:04.237
I told you I salvaged it
off an atoll the Smokers hit.

502
00:56:05.738 --> 00:56:09.242
Smokers don't leave anything after a raid.

503
00:56:09.367 --> 00:56:11.202
Especially dirt.

504
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:15.248
You've been there, haven't you?

505
00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.587
Dryland?

506
00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:23.756
You know where it is.

507
00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:28.636
- Yeah, I know where it is.
- Oh...

508
00:56:30.054 --> 00:56:31.514
And...

509
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:35.393
- And we're going?
- You and I are.

510
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:40.273
The kid we've got to pitch over the side.

511
00:56:42.942 --> 00:56:45.695
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

512
00:56:46.988 --> 00:56:51.951
I'm taking on water. I'll be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

513
00:56:52.076 --> 00:56:55.538
You know, I said I won't drink.

514
00:56:56.539 --> 00:56:58.207
For 12 days?

515
00:57:00.627 --> 00:57:05.924
No. It's better one of you dies now
than both of you die slow.

516
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:07.884
Wait, wait.

517
00:57:08.009 --> 00:57:10.720
We saved your life. We got you out.

518
00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:14.849
No, you got me out so you could get out.
We're even.

519
00:57:14.974 --> 00:57:17.143
She can cook. She can fish.

520
00:57:17.268 --> 00:57:19.270
- So can I.
- Take my necklace.

521
00:57:19.395 --> 00:57:22.690
- I got better ones below.
- No, look! Oh.

522
00:57:24.692 --> 00:57:28.071
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

523
00:57:28.196 --> 00:57:30.990
I can understand why you would want to.

524
00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:33.076
But she's a child.

525
00:57:35.203 --> 00:57:36.746
(Humming)

526
00:57:43.836 --> 00:57:46.506
Is there something else, then?

527
00:57:51.844 --> 00:57:54.514
Enola, go below.

528
00:57:55.515 --> 00:57:57.141
Enola.

529
00:58:19.664 --> 00:58:21.040
Yeah.

530
00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:23.084
You said so yourself.

531
00:58:24.419 --> 00:58:26.671
Been out there a long time.

532
00:59:14.886 --> 00:59:18.890
A couple of hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

533
00:59:19.015 --> 00:59:21.768
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

534
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.901
Know what I was really thinking?

535
00:59:30.026 --> 00:59:33.696
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

536
00:59:34.697 --> 00:59:36.657
You got nothing I need.

537
00:59:53.716 --> 00:59:56.260
You're taking us to Dryland.

538
01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:02.934
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

539
01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:06.729
- Believe me, I'm not the one to start on.
- Both of us!

540
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:16.030
- How long do you plan to hold that on me?
- As long as it takes.

541
01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:20.785
OK.

542
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:22.286
Ah!

543
01:00:23.996 --> 01:00:26.582
Let me out! Let me out of here!

544
01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:31.295
You coward! Don't you touch my child!

545
01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.589
Come here! I...

546
01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:36.592
(She grunts)

547
01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:41.097
Oh...

548
01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:42.223
Oh...

549
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.011
OK, now don't move, OK?

550
01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:05.598
There. Oh, looking real good, yeah.

551
01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:06.933
There.

552
01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.727
There. All done.

553
01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:13.773
Now there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

554
01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:16.359
It better not screw up my short game.

555
01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:19.779
Well?

556
01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:23.241
- (Woman) Looks good.
- It's better than your real eye.

557
01:02:23.366 --> 01:02:27.161
- Much better.
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.

558
01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:31.499
- Looks like shit.
- That's why I love children. No guile.

559
01:02:35.044 --> 01:02:36.837
It does look like shit!

560
01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:42.051
- And it feels like cold shit!
- Deacon?

561
01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:50.017
Sorry It's just there's a problem
in the pit. Maybe you should come.

562
01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:56.732
Let's drive.

563
01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:07.994
To the pit.
Don't bother with the scenic route.

564
01:03:08.119 --> 01:03:09.453
Drive!

565
01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:13.291
(Deacon) Hey, it's driving better.

566
01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.963
(âª "Peter Gunn Theme")

567
01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:24.176
(Rowdy yelling)

568
01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:26.554
Get off!

569
01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:30.099
Get off! Get out the way!

570
01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:34.186
- Get out the way!
- All right, all right. OK, OK.

571
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.401
Bless you, cousins.
Bless all you cousins over there.

572
01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:44.447
Keep up the good work!
Growth is progress, growth is progress.

573
01:03:44.572 --> 01:03:46.282
(Man) Somebody!

574
01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:48.784
Hey, up there!

575
01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:51.120
Take it off!

576
01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:56.667
- Yes?
- Your Deaconship.

577
01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.169
Hello!

578
01:03:58.294 --> 01:04:02.631
Good morning. Or night.
Whichever the case may be.

579
01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:05.468
What is it? I'm a busy man.

580
01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:09.388
I thought you should know
you're down to exactly

581
01:04:10.389 --> 01:04:13.434
four feet nine inches of black stuff.

582
01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.067
- Thank you, sir.
- How many Gs after refining?

583
01:04:21.192 --> 01:04:25.279
- Maybe three refuelers.
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.

584
01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:28.240
Sweet Joe! What's happening to this place?

585
01:04:30.076 --> 01:04:33.079
- We outgrowed it.
- All right.

586
01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:36.665
The only thing that is important
is the tattooed girl.

587
01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:39.460
We don't spare any go-juice finding her.

588
01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:44.256
We don't waste it anywhere else. Cancel
all those tractor pulls and all that stuff

589
01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:46.842
until later. You got it?

590
01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:50.971
Dryland is the mother lode.

591
01:04:51.097 --> 01:04:53.265
Ha-ha! On your toes.

592
01:05:16.997 --> 01:05:19.208
Why don't you use sea hydro?

593
01:05:20.418 --> 01:05:22.753
The salt's harder on the filters.

594
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:47.403
Can we have some?

595
01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:52.283
It's for her, not me.

596
01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:05.504
Here, come on.

597
01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:10.509
- Is he going to take us to Dryland?
- Sure he is.

598
01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:11.635
Yeah.

599
01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:18.017
All of it, all of it, all of it.

600
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:23.439
Good. Good, good. Come on.

601
01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:37.369
Thanks for not killing us.

602
01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:56.597
Just stay away from him.

603
01:07:28.504 --> 01:07:30.798
- Hi.
- Move.

604
01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:34.260
(Helen) Enola! Enola, come here!

605
01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:37.930
Come on!

606
01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:42.601
Enola, come over here.

607
01:07:56.282 --> 01:07:57.700
Hey!

608
01:07:59.994 --> 01:08:04.873
- What are you doing?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

609
01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:11.547
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

610
01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:14.592
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

611
01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:18.721
- I drew it for you.
- Don't draw on anything! Understand?

612
01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:30.733
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

613
01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:34.028
You take up space
and you're slowing me down.

614
01:08:37.323 --> 01:08:41.619
You know, she's just a little girl.
She doesn't know your rules.

615
01:08:41.744 --> 01:08:44.538
You wanna stay? You teach her.

616
01:09:02.848 --> 01:09:05.476
Enola, what did I tell you?

617
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.900
You're not so tough, you know that?

618
01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:19.239
How many people have you killed?

619
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.495
Ten? Twenty?

620
01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:28.666
You talk a lot.

621
01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:31.251
I talk a lot cos you don't talk at all.

622
01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.295
So how many?

623
01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:39.968
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

624
01:09:42.763 --> 01:09:46.767
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

625
01:09:49.478 --> 01:09:53.732
In fact, you talk all the time!
It's like a storm when you're around!

626
01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:56.568
(Helen) Enola! Hey, what are you doing?

627
01:09:56.694 --> 01:10:00.280
- Helen!
- She can't swim!

628
01:10:00.406 --> 01:10:03.283
(Enola) Help me! Helen!

629
01:10:03.409 --> 01:10:05.661
Helen, help me!

630
01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.831
Help!

631
01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:11.458
Helen, help me!

632
01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:22.010
Helen! Help!

633
01:10:22.136 --> 01:10:23.929
Hold on.

634
01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:26.724
Look at me, look at me.

635
01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.395
Oh... Wait. Come on.

636
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.855
Please!

637
01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:33.981
Please!

638
01:10:34.106 --> 01:10:35.899
Oh, please!

639
01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:37.985
(Helen coughs)

640
01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:42.865
Hey!

641
01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:48.120
Hold on. OK... Almost.

642
01:10:48.746 --> 01:10:50.164
(Gasping)

643
01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:01.216
(Enola gasps)

644
01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:07.598
Thanks. But I swear,
if you ever touch her again...

645
01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:12.728
Sonofabitch! Look at me! You'll go to bed
that night and you will never wake up.

646
01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:14.938
- Shut up.
- What?

647
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.983
- (Helen) Smokers?
- Yeah.

648
01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.068
Well, can't we outrun them?

649
01:11:20.194 --> 01:11:24.364
- (Plane engine hums)
- Not with my sail down.

650
01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:46.345
- What are you thinking about?
- That's a nice touch.

651
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.263
That's them!

652
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.980
Don't hit the kid!

653
01:12:00.692 --> 01:12:03.320
(Laughing)

654
01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:14.164
Hey!

655
01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.171
Coward!

656
01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:29.179
(Laughs)

657
01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:31.390
- (Gun jams)
- Fuck!

658
01:13:00.002 --> 01:13:01.837
No!

659
01:13:04.715 --> 01:13:07.217
Hey! Urgh!

660
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.776
Cut it!

661
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:35.662
Come on! Come on!

662
01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:57.851
(Mast creaking)

663
01:14:08.403 --> 01:14:09.905
Aaah!

664
01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:14.636
(Helen) Oh...I'm really sorry.

665
01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:17.973
I'm sorry! You didn't give me much choice.

666
01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:22.102
I know. But you ran away.

667
01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:24.104
I... What?

668
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:27.065
What are you do...? No! Please, no!

669
01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:34.197
(Grunting)

670
01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:41.538
Don't ever touch anything
on my boat again.

671
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.127
She said she was sorry!

672
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:53.383
That means you're supposed to
say something back!

673
01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:19.076
- Did you say something?
- (Enola) Mm-mm.

674
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.444
(Deacon) Fore!

675
01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:58.323
- Nice putt.
- It wasn't a putt. That was a drive.

676
01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:01.409
I wasn't even using my good eye. Damn it!

677
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.789
You got an ashtray or something?

678
01:17:05.914 --> 01:17:07.916
Oh, man.

679
01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.877
Damn thing never did work right.

680
01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:13.588
- You said to bring the pilot.
- Yes, I did.

681
01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:17.342
- Well, he's here.
- Why didn't you tell me?

682
01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:21.012
Come on, Nord. Well, tell me about it.

683
01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:26.101
- The child. Did he have her with him?
- Yeah. And some atoll bitch!

684
01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:29.688
They killed Ed!

685
01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:34.067
Now, now. Don't you fret yourself.
Plenty more where Ed came from.

686
01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:37.445
- Heading west south-west?
- From here.

687
01:17:37.571 --> 01:17:41.199
If we launch now,
we can cut him down just about here.

688
01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:44.828
- If he doesn't change course.
- That's not likely.

689
01:17:44.953 --> 01:17:47.998
He's a wily one, that ichthy demon.

690
01:19:31.518 --> 01:19:33.520
(Drifter calls out)

691
01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:36.982
- Drifter?
- Mm-hm.

692
01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.900
Are we going to stop?

693
01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:40.986
- (Drifter) Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

694
01:19:41.111 --> 01:19:43.780
I thought you all stopped for each other.

695
01:19:49.369 --> 01:19:51.121
Maybe he has some FOOD!

696
01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:57.252
Don't find many who follow the rules
any more.

697
01:19:57.377 --> 01:20:00.130
Make it quick. What's your business?

698
01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:07.595
Trade.

699
01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:11.391
Got any resin?

700
01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:17.689
Resin? He's out of his mind.
He's out of his mind completely. Resin?

701
01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:21.443
You've been outwater a long time,
haven't you?

702
01:20:22.444 --> 01:20:25.530
Don't be joking me, man! Resin!
You don't got enough.

703
01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:28.867
- How about food?
- Could you say that again, please?

704
01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:31.870
- How about food?
- Well, yeah, food.

705
01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:33.955
That'd be good, eh?

706
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.500
I haven't eaten in, well, you know,
forever.

707
01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:43.506
Which one of you two is the cook, then?
I usually fall for the waitress.

708
01:20:45.133 --> 01:20:48.762
- Like you said, I don't have much.
- I'll decide.

709
01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:53.266
Look at you. We could start
with that wee orchard over there.

710
01:20:54.351 --> 01:20:55.393
Woo!

711
01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:58.688
(Mariner) All right. Hold it there.

712
01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:01.816
- We can talk.
- Fair enough.

713
01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:04.819
(Muttering)

714
01:21:07.781 --> 01:21:11.534
It's a nice rod, isn't it?
I like that rod. It's a nice rod.

715
01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:13.161
My favorite.

716
01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:22.295
Got yourself a wee harem going here,
don't you now?

717
01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:32.472
- What do you want for the women?
- We're not for sale.

718
01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:36.476
Not for sale? I mean, there's
no such thing as not for sale.

719
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:38.561
Not for sale, not for sale. Aye.

720
01:21:40.647 --> 01:21:44.067
Are they a pair
or would you sell them separate?

721
01:21:44.192 --> 01:21:48.279
Our business is done here, unless
you've got some resin you can part with.

722
01:21:48.405 --> 01:21:52.742
I told you once already, I don't have any.
I don't have it, don't have it.

723
01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:57.205
Haven't seen any for trade in lunars now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

724
01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:03.920
I do have something
that'll make you change your mind.

725
01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:06.256
Something you can't pass on.

726
01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:10.927
I took it off an atoller refugee camp.

727
01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:15.056
Life savings of the entire clan.

728
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:25.024
Paper! Look at my wee paper.

729
01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:31.239
Paper! Have you ever seen paper?
Look at it, smell it.

730
01:22:34.075 --> 01:22:36.453
I'm saving it for a special trade.

731
01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:41.458
Don't you do it.

732
01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:46.546
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person.
Whose boat is this anyway?

733
01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:51.259
- Is it your boat or your boat?
- It's his boat, but he doesn't own us.

734
01:22:57.891 --> 01:23:02.562
- Half an hour.
- He's obviously out of his mind.

735
01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:05.523
I've got two pages in here, man!

736
01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:09.235
- I'd get half a dozen girls with this.
- Half an hour.

737
01:23:10.487 --> 01:23:12.697
- You trading or not?
- Don't!

738
01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.824
Shut up.

739
01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:17.035
OK.

740
01:23:19.704 --> 01:23:23.917
45 minutes with the wee one. I like to do
the talkin', if you know what I mean.

741
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.587
No!

742
01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:30.381
Fair enough.

743
01:23:30.507 --> 01:23:32.592
Come, come, come, come, come.

744
01:23:32.717 --> 01:23:35.053
No. My boat.

745
01:23:36.513 --> 01:23:39.140
That's fair enough.
Good, good, good, good, good.

746
01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:40.350
Helen...

747
01:23:40.475 --> 01:23:44.103
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

748
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.843
Half an hour.

749
01:24:59.846 --> 01:25:00.847
Well...

750
01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:05.476
It's been a while for me now.

751
01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:10.356
Guess it's been more than a while,
actually, but...

752
01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:14.819
I've only got half an hour.

753
01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:18.906
Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour,
half an hour, half an hour.

754
01:25:19.032 --> 01:25:21.075
OK, right, right, right.

755
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.497
You're so beautiful.
Anyone ever told you that?

756
01:25:26.623 --> 01:25:30.293
Give me that! What are you doing?
It's just a game!

757
01:25:31.169 --> 01:25:33.379
Oh, I...

758
01:25:33.504 --> 01:25:35.381
I... We was just playing.

759
01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.553
Trade's off.

760
01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:42.513
I changed my mind.

761
01:25:42.639 --> 01:25:44.515
Well, um...

762
01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:49.145
Well, you can't do that.
I mean, a deal's a deal. Aye.

763
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.481
I just did.

764
01:25:53.733 --> 01:25:56.944
She's mine, aye. No, no, no.
I won't have it.

765
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:58.780
- No.
- Go on.

766
01:25:58.905 --> 01:26:02.617
Go, go, go, good. Aye, aye.
Don't go too far now!

767
01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:05.578
This won't take but a minute.

768
01:26:09.749 --> 01:26:11.751
I hate this boat.

769
01:26:11.876 --> 01:26:14.629
I...hate...this...boat!

770
01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:17.757
You garbage!

771
01:26:22.762 --> 01:26:23.763
You...

772
01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:29.185
You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't you?

773
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.198
Aargh!

774
01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:44.409
(Crashing and yelling)

775
01:26:57.922 --> 01:26:59.799
Where's me boat?

776
01:27:00.925 --> 01:27:02.802
Where's me boat?

777
01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:06.013
(Mutters to himself)

778
01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:12.562
Help me to me boat.

779
01:27:14.021 --> 01:27:16.357
Ah! The boat...

780
01:27:51.601 --> 01:27:54.395
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,

781
01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.191
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

782
01:27:58.316 --> 01:28:02.153
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

783
01:28:02.278 --> 01:28:05.114
The important question is
where's he headed?

784
01:28:05.239 --> 01:28:08.284
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

785
01:28:09.285 --> 01:28:10.286
Dryland.

786
01:28:11.245 --> 01:28:12.663
Salvation.

787
01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:15.124
Room to grow 18 holes.

788
01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.293
36, 72!

789
01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:22.173
I say that he's headed here
and we take him here.

790
01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:52.370
How long before we get some wind?

791
01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:54.789
Days, maybe.

792
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:57.667
Then why don't we fish?

793
01:28:57.792 --> 01:28:59.627
What for?

794
01:29:00.628 --> 01:29:04.465
- So we can get something to eat?
- We ate two days ago.

795
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.008
You ate.

796
01:29:08.928 --> 01:29:09.929
Just...

797
01:29:12.932 --> 01:29:14.934
Just help me fix this.

798
01:29:15.935 --> 01:29:18.354
I'll catch something myself.

799
01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:22.233
You're not going to catch anything
with this around here.

800
01:29:23.734 --> 01:29:24.902
Look,

801
01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.239
we're not trying to make you angry.

802
01:29:31.117 --> 01:29:33.744
And you don't disappear
when you turn your back.

803
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:38.165
- You don't know what fishing's like here.
- Then you do it, if you're the authority.

804
01:29:49.552 --> 01:29:52.179
Maybe he doesn't know how to fish.

805
01:29:53.806 --> 01:29:57.518
- I think you're right, Enola.
- Shut up, will ya?

806
01:29:57.643 --> 01:30:01.981
- I'm trying to listen for engines.
- I will not shut up!

807
01:30:02.106 --> 01:30:06.402
Until you stop what you're doing and help
me find something to eat for this child!

808
01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:09.405
I will scream so loud that it...

809
01:30:10.948 --> 01:30:13.117
Put that... No!

810
01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:17.788
You'll never catch anything with this.
It's useless.

811
01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:25.546
(Helen) Look, I'm sorry!

812
01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:28.257
You were right about the pole.

813
01:30:28.382 --> 01:30:30.259
You were right!

814
01:30:30.384 --> 01:30:32.386
But we have to eat.

815
01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.268
I know you can hear me!

816
01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:42.939
We can fish for ourselves.
Just show us what to do.

817
01:30:43.064 --> 01:30:46.943
- You must know. Even you've got to eat!
- You just sit there.

818
01:31:10.841 --> 01:31:12.635
What...?

819
01:31:42.707 --> 01:31:44.583
(Muffled explosion)

820
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:52.341
Happy now?

821
01:31:56.345 --> 01:31:58.764
(Enola happily hums)

822
01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:12.403
You don't like my singing, do you?

823
01:32:16.157 --> 01:32:20.411
Helen says you don't like my singing
cos you can't sing.

824
01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.712
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

825
01:32:32.256 --> 01:32:34.050
The sound of the world.

826
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:42.850
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud.

827
01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:46.353
And moving around all the time.
Try sitting still.

828
01:32:48.022 --> 01:32:50.107
Eyeball?

829
01:33:07.291 --> 01:33:09.919
Go ahead. Drink all you want.

830
01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:13.172
It's gonna rain tonight.

831
01:33:31.732 --> 01:33:33.692
I wish I had feet like his.

832
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:40.449
- Then maybe I could swim.
- Enola...

833
01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:46.038
(Belches) Sorry.

834
01:33:51.043 --> 01:33:54.255
I never met a person
who couldn't swim before.

835
01:33:55.965 --> 01:33:57.466
I can't.

836
01:34:00.344 --> 01:34:02.513
People said I was weird.

837
01:34:02.638 --> 01:34:04.598
Maybe they're right.

838
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.688
Maybe they were right about you, too.

839
01:34:37.423 --> 01:34:39.383
(Wind whistles)

840
01:34:42.052 --> 01:34:44.054
(âª Mellow jazz trumpet plays)

841
01:35:14.293 --> 01:35:16.503
Is that from Dryland?

842
01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:19.340
(Turns music off)

843
01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:20.549
Yeah.

844
01:35:26.972 --> 01:35:28.390
(Sighs)

845
01:35:33.312 --> 01:35:37.191
- I don't even know your name.
- I don't need one.

846
01:35:38.859 --> 01:35:41.153
Enola wanted to give this to you.

847
01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:47.868
And this.

848
01:35:50.788 --> 01:35:52.998
She won't take it again.

849
01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:01.173
You don't look much like her.

850
01:36:01.298 --> 01:36:04.510
I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.

851
01:36:04.635 --> 01:36:06.053
You act like it.

852
01:36:07.012 --> 01:36:09.014
About six years ago,

853
01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:13.811
this basket floated into the atoll
with Enola in it.

854
01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:19.358
Of course, everyone wanted to shove her
back out to sea. That was the law.

855
01:36:20.276 --> 01:36:22.236
She was so precious.

856
01:36:22.361 --> 01:36:24.530
I wanted to keep her.

857
01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:29.576
So the Elders talked and said
that if I wanted her so badly,

858
01:36:29.702 --> 01:36:32.329
I could never have a child of my own.

859
01:36:34.081 --> 01:36:37.042
There was no one else.
She would have died otherwise.

860
01:36:38.127 --> 01:36:39.211
So?

861
01:36:39.336 --> 01:36:41.380
It's called compassion.

862
01:36:42.965 --> 01:36:43.966
Oh...

863
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:49.096
You probably wouldn't understand
after being alone so much.

864
01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:53.267
I'm not alone.
I've got this boat for a friend.

865
01:36:54.643 --> 01:36:59.440
It don't lie to me,
don't cut my throat when I'm asleep.

866
01:36:59.565 --> 01:37:01.900
Gives me a place to be.

867
01:37:02.026 --> 01:37:04.320
I pity you, really.

868
01:37:05.738 --> 01:37:08.073
- What's pity?
- You don't know?

869
01:37:08.198 --> 01:37:10.492
If I knew, I wouldn't ask.

870
01:37:11.744 --> 01:37:15.664
Well, if you don't know,
I could never make you understand.

871
01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:21.545
- What are those marks on her back?
- Nothing.

872
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:26.342
- They're just fanciful things.
- Like what she draws?

873
01:37:26.467 --> 01:37:30.804
She draws what she sees.
She's like a mirror.

874
01:37:32.348 --> 01:37:34.892
People on the atoll thought she was a...

875
01:37:36.352 --> 01:37:38.270
Freak?

876
01:37:39.104 --> 01:37:43.567
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I just thought she was special.

877
01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:55.079
I'm not giving it to her. It's just...

878
01:37:55.204 --> 01:37:56.955
A loan.

879
01:37:57.081 --> 01:38:00.000
Yeah. I'm not giving it to her.

880
01:38:06.006 --> 01:38:08.008
Is Dryland beautiful?

881
01:38:10.177 --> 01:38:11.929
You'll see.

882
01:39:17.995 --> 01:39:19.997
(Enola giggles)

883
01:39:25.711 --> 01:39:27.171
Enola?

884
01:39:28.338 --> 01:39:30.340
Enola! What are you doing?

885
01:39:30.466 --> 01:39:33.927
- Those monsters will kill her!
- They're asleep now.

886
01:39:37.014 --> 01:39:39.016
Hands around my neck.

887
01:39:41.143 --> 01:39:45.856
Let the water tell your arms and legs
how to move. Going down. Hold your breath.

888
01:41:25.455 --> 01:41:28.417
- What is it?
- What is it?

889
01:41:30.252 --> 01:41:32.170
Barter outpost.

890
01:41:32.963 --> 01:41:37.801
- You said we'd get to Dryland today.
- Today, tomorrow. What does it matter?

891
01:41:39.428 --> 01:41:41.430
We need resin.

892
01:41:42.806 --> 01:41:45.017
(Speaks PortuGreek)

893
01:41:51.064 --> 01:41:53.775
- What is that?
- It's PortuGreek.

894
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.738
Their own language.

895
01:41:59.489 --> 01:42:01.491
That's what I thought.

896
01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:29.102
Ah.

897
01:42:30.187 --> 01:42:33.815
There's my girl. Yes.

898
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.527
Howdy, darling.
Come on in here now.

899
01:43:06.139 --> 01:43:09.476
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

900
01:43:12.896 --> 01:43:14.773
What the hell...?

901
01:43:18.402 --> 01:43:20.153
He's spotted us!

902
01:43:20.278 --> 01:43:23.031
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!

903
01:43:23.156 --> 01:43:25.200
Sound it! Sound it!

904
01:43:36.294 --> 01:43:38.839
Woo-hoo!

905
01:43:46.722 --> 01:43:48.306
Enola!

906
01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:03.238
Starboard side! Now!

907
01:44:04.406 --> 01:44:06.241
Get in the chair!

908
01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:15.500
Watch it! He's clearing the net!

909
01:44:26.928 --> 01:44:29.014
Go to the helm!

910
01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:33.351
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

911
01:44:33.477 --> 01:44:37.272
What centerboard? Where exactly?
I don't know what to do!

912
01:44:37.397 --> 01:44:39.608
Under the helm, pull the handle!

913
01:44:42.152 --> 01:44:44.070
Hey. Hey!

914
01:44:46.615 --> 01:44:48.992
It's too late! Over here.

915
01:45:01.755 --> 01:45:03.131
Aaah!

916
01:45:07.969 --> 01:45:09.262
No!

917
01:45:26.613 --> 01:45:28.240
Give me that rifle.

918
01:45:28.365 --> 01:45:32.911
Boy, if you want to do something right,
you've got to do it yourself.

919
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:35.872
All right.

920
01:45:36.957 --> 01:45:38.542
Ugh!

921
01:45:42.796 --> 01:45:44.047
I winged him.

922
01:45:44.172 --> 01:45:48.009
Load all the go-juice onto one boat
and run the freak down.

923
01:45:48.134 --> 01:45:51.263
You can't catch him with ten boats
and you want to send just one?

924
01:45:51.388 --> 01:45:53.932
Well, I pray that you're joking.

925
01:46:02.023 --> 01:46:03.817
Bring me the Trackers.

926
01:46:17.497 --> 01:46:22.168
You lied to us!
You were going to sell us back there!

927
01:46:22.294 --> 01:46:24.254
Then we both lied.

928
01:46:24.379 --> 01:46:25.422
What?

929
01:46:27.382 --> 01:46:28.800
I saw what I saw.

930
01:46:28.925 --> 01:46:31.928
- He's hurt.
- So he should be.

931
01:46:32.053 --> 01:46:33.388
He was going to sell us.

932
01:46:38.101 --> 01:46:40.770
No wonder you let her keep it!

933
01:46:40.896 --> 01:46:42.522
You leave it!

934
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:48.820
- Why do they want her?
- There's nothing human about you.

935
01:46:48.945 --> 01:46:51.781
They should have killed you
the day you were born.

936
01:46:51.907 --> 01:46:53.825
They tried.

937
01:46:55.577 --> 01:46:57.579
No more lies.

938
01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:02.334
- Ah!
- What are the marks on her back?

939
01:47:03.376 --> 01:47:06.296
People say it's the way to Dryland.

940
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:08.673
- Dryland's a myth!
- No!

941
01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:12.761
You said so yourself that you know
where it is. You did.

942
01:47:17.599 --> 01:47:21.186
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

943
01:47:21.311 --> 01:47:25.690
I've seen it. I've touched it. Dirt
that was richer and darker than yours.

944
01:47:25.815 --> 01:47:27.651
In the basket we found Enola in!

945
01:47:27.776 --> 01:47:30.612
- It doesn't exist!
- How can you be so sure?

946
01:47:30.737 --> 01:47:35.200
I've sailed farther than most have
dreamed. And I've never seen it.

947
01:47:36.826 --> 01:47:41.623
- But the things on your boat.
- Things on my boat? What?

948
01:47:41.748 --> 01:47:45.919
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

949
01:47:46.044 --> 01:47:48.046
What are these shells?

950
01:47:48.171 --> 01:47:50.715
And that reflecting glass?

951
01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:53.885
And...and...and the music box.

952
01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.516
If not from Dryland, then where? Where?

953
01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.937
You want to see Dryland?

954
01:48:05.647 --> 01:48:08.066
You really want to see it?

955
01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:11.736
I'll take you to Dryland.

956
01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:26.751
Get in.

957
01:48:32.841 --> 01:48:36.011
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

958
01:48:36.136 --> 01:48:38.847
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

959
01:48:51.026 --> 01:48:53.069
Don't touch anything.

960
01:48:57.532 --> 01:48:58.950
OK?

961
01:52:35.792 --> 01:52:37.752
I didn't know.

962
01:52:39.796 --> 01:52:41.756
All this time?

963
01:52:43.007 --> 01:52:46.177
- I didn't know.
- Nobody does.

964
01:52:55.061 --> 01:52:59.983
- Can you get us out of here?
- I'd say there's two chances of that.

965
01:53:00.692 --> 01:53:03.027
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

966
01:53:03.152 --> 01:53:06.572
Should have bought me that drink.
Come on!

967
01:53:06.698 --> 01:53:08.574
This way. Come on!

968
01:53:09.867 --> 01:53:11.869
(Celebratory whooping)

969
01:53:11.995 --> 01:53:13.663
(Man) Yeah!

970
01:53:15.498 --> 01:53:19.836
Proper introductions first.
I'm the Deacon.

971
01:53:21.421 --> 01:53:23.214
(Laughing)

972
01:53:25.466 --> 01:53:30.346
If you don't recall the face, perhaps
it's cos I didn't always look like this.

973
01:53:33.266 --> 01:53:37.103
Now, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

974
01:53:38.104 --> 01:53:40.273
So we could tear this boat apart,

975
01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:43.359
but I'd rather somebody just tell me
where she is.

976
01:53:43.484 --> 01:53:45.778
The first one that does that lives.

977
01:53:45.903 --> 01:53:50.408
And the runner-up... Well, actually,
there are no runners-up.

978
01:53:53.286 --> 01:53:55.663
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.

979
01:53:55.788 --> 01:53:58.833
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.

980
01:54:00.168 --> 01:54:02.170
You know, personally,

981
01:54:03.171 --> 01:54:06.966
I'd rather shoot
the sperm of the devil here. Huh?

982
01:54:07.091 --> 01:54:09.093
But you know something?

983
01:54:09.218 --> 01:54:14.140
I don't think you're going to tell me,
are you? Huh? Too bad.

984
01:54:15.016 --> 01:54:16.934
Come on. Eh?

985
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:20.104
What do you say? She's not your kind.

986
01:54:21.689 --> 01:54:23.775
You don't even have a kind.

987
01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.902
If you say it,

988
01:54:26.027 --> 01:54:28.529
he'll still kill us both.

989
01:54:33.117 --> 01:54:35.328
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

990
01:54:36.788 --> 01:54:38.748
If you don't tell me,

991
01:54:38.873 --> 01:54:42.293
I swear to Poseidon
that we'll torch your boat.

992
01:54:48.549 --> 01:54:51.928
Refresh my memory-
what if neither one of them talks?

993
01:54:52.053 --> 01:54:55.098
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

994
01:54:55.932 --> 01:55:00.853
All right! If they won't tell us
where she is, do 'em! Both of them!

995
01:55:00.978 --> 01:55:03.189
- Just kill 'em now!
- No!

996
01:55:05.817 --> 01:55:07.693
So gullible! Ha-ha! Bring her here.

997
01:55:09.237 --> 01:55:12.657
- (Smokers cheer)
- Seek and ye shall receive!

998
01:55:12.782 --> 01:55:16.285
So ends your daily sermonette!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

999
01:55:16.411 --> 01:55:18.871
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1000
01:55:18.996 --> 01:55:20.206
Yes!

1001
01:55:21.207 --> 01:55:24.127
Here, take her, boys. Take care of her.

1002
01:55:25.878 --> 01:55:27.922
What is it?

1003
01:55:29.382 --> 01:55:30.800
Stunning.

1004
01:55:30.925 --> 01:55:35.596
I don't have words to even begin to...
It's magnificent.

1005
01:55:35.721 --> 01:55:39.600
Look at that! That square footage.

1006
01:55:39.725 --> 01:55:41.102
Huh? Huh?

1007
01:55:41.227 --> 01:55:46.274
Now figure this map out. Turn her upside
down. Does that mean anything to you?

1008
01:55:46.399 --> 01:55:47.400
No.

1009
01:55:47.525 --> 01:55:52.655
All right. We'll figure it out
back at the 'Dez, boys. Careful with her.

1010
01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:57.076
- What about them?
- Do 'em both. Torch the boat.

1011
01:55:58.077 --> 01:55:59.454
Aargh!

1012
01:56:01.539 --> 01:56:03.332
We have to go under!

1013
01:56:05.585 --> 01:56:08.212
No! I can't breathe like you!

1014
01:56:08.337 --> 01:56:11.048
I'll breathe for both of us.

1015
01:56:35.072 --> 01:56:36.073
Woo!

1016
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.788
(Enola) Helen, help!

1017
01:56:42.914 --> 01:56:44.624
Helen!

1018
01:56:44.749 --> 01:56:46.501
Helen!

1019
01:57:33.631 --> 01:57:35.466
My boat.

1020
01:57:45.268 --> 01:57:46.852
Enola...

1021
01:57:52.858 --> 01:57:54.735
(Deacon) A-ha!

1022
01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.113
All right!

1023
01:57:57.238 --> 01:58:02.368
I can't wait to get this thing out,
build some highways and some freeways!

1024
01:58:02.493 --> 01:58:06.706
There you go, cuz. Be careful now.
You break 'em, you can't use 'em.

1025
01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:09.166
Come on! What's happening, cousin?

1026
01:58:09.292 --> 01:58:12.753
Not a word.
She just sits there and leaks.

1027
01:58:12.878 --> 01:58:16.591
A shiver to the liver. This'll make her
give up all her secrets, huh?

1028
01:58:16.716 --> 01:58:20.970
Yeah, or kill her. Let me talk to her
first. I'm real good with kids.

1029
01:58:23.889 --> 01:58:27.393
What is this? Get those chains off her!

1030
01:58:27.518 --> 01:58:29.729
What are we, barbarians here?

1031
01:58:29.854 --> 01:58:32.773
Goodness gracious. Snakes alive.

1032
01:58:32.898 --> 01:58:35.901
Come on, out of here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

1033
01:58:36.986 --> 01:58:39.238
Rub-a-dub-dub. (Chuckles)

1034
01:58:41.032 --> 01:58:44.619
You want to come over here
and sit on my lap?

1035
01:58:44.744 --> 01:58:46.162
No.

1036
01:58:47.413 --> 01:58:49.665
How about a cigarette?

1037
01:58:50.666 --> 01:58:53.961
Nothing like a good smoke
when you miss your mom.

1038
01:58:54.086 --> 01:58:56.005
Never too young to start.

1039
01:58:57.465 --> 01:58:58.841
No.

1040
01:58:58.966 --> 01:59:01.636
Well, I got something right here
I know you'd like.

1041
01:59:02.887 --> 01:59:06.098
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

1042
01:59:09.769 --> 01:59:11.979
Now they're yours,

1043
01:59:12.104 --> 01:59:16.901
if you help me
with just one problem. All right?

1044
01:59:18.819 --> 01:59:20.821
Now I got this parish.

1045
01:59:20.946 --> 01:59:22.948
A good parish.

1046
01:59:23.074 --> 01:59:25.117
A large parish.

1047
01:59:26.118 --> 01:59:28.621
Getting larger all the time, in fact.

1048
01:59:28.746 --> 01:59:31.040
Now, you know,

1049
01:59:31.165 --> 01:59:33.668
I just don't have enough space

1050
01:59:35.044 --> 01:59:38.756
- for all these people.
- Why don't you make less people?

1051
01:59:38.881 --> 01:59:40.257
Pardon?

1052
01:59:41.342 --> 01:59:45.346
The atoll. Babies are born
only when there's room.

1053
01:59:45.471 --> 01:59:49.100
That way,
there's food and hydro for everyone.

1054
01:59:49.225 --> 01:59:52.812
Well, that's a...quaint suggestion,

1055
01:59:53.813 --> 01:59:56.232
but it don't really play here,

1056
01:59:56.357 --> 02:00:00.653
considering we are, in fact,
the Church of Eternal Growth.

1057
02:00:02.071 --> 02:00:07.243
See, what we need is more land,
for more people.

1058
02:00:07.368 --> 02:00:10.496
Now... Now that tattoo on your back.

1059
02:00:10.621 --> 02:00:13.541
I've been told that that...

1060
02:00:13.666 --> 02:00:15.459
that's actually a map?

1061
02:00:18.003 --> 02:00:20.047
It's the way to Dryland.

1062
02:00:20.172 --> 02:00:22.258
Now we're getting someplace.

1063
02:00:24.677 --> 02:00:27.596
Could you teach me how to read that?

1064
02:00:29.348 --> 02:00:31.350
Setback.

1065
02:00:34.645 --> 02:00:39.275
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

1066
02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:44.029
You know, like your mommy
or your pet fish? He say anything?

1067
02:00:44.155 --> 02:00:46.490
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

1068
02:00:46.615 --> 02:00:51.537
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like.
He took out my eye!

1069
02:00:51.662 --> 02:00:54.874
And if I ever see him again,
I'm gonna cut open his head

1070
02:00:54.999 --> 02:00:59.879
and I'm gonna eat his brain!
You think he'd like that?

1071
02:01:00.671 --> 02:01:04.091
You can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

1072
02:01:05.134 --> 02:01:07.136
But he's not here.

1073
02:01:07.261 --> 02:01:09.263
And he ain't coming.

1074
02:01:09.388 --> 02:01:11.265
And no one's gonna save you.

1075
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:14.602
He'll come for me. He will.

1076
02:01:14.727 --> 02:01:16.812
Well, you better tell me
what I wanna know

1077
02:01:16.937 --> 02:01:21.317
or he can save what's left of you
in a goddamn jar!

1078
02:01:24.987 --> 02:01:27.031
I'm glad we had this little talk.

1079
02:01:28.574 --> 02:01:30.493
Chain her.

1080
02:01:32.787 --> 02:01:34.622
Chain her up.

1081
02:01:35.623 --> 02:01:38.584
He'll come for me! He'll take me away!

1082
02:01:50.012 --> 02:01:52.431
We're going to die here, aren't we?

1083
02:02:12.243 --> 02:02:14.119
Aren't we?

1084
02:02:23.462 --> 02:02:25.339
After the atoll,

1085
02:02:25.464 --> 02:02:28.008
when I offered myself to you,

1086
02:02:31.095 --> 02:02:33.305
why didn't you take me?

1087
02:02:35.891 --> 02:02:37.893
Cos you didn't really want me.

1088
02:02:39.979 --> 02:02:41.647
Not really.

1089
02:03:47.421 --> 02:03:49.632
Have I been sleeping?

1090
02:03:55.638 --> 02:03:57.431
I was dreaming.

1091
02:04:00.434 --> 02:04:02.227
It's funny.

1092
02:04:03.228 --> 02:04:05.606
I always thought Dryland floated.

1093
02:04:05.731 --> 02:04:09.610
Or drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

1094
02:04:09.735 --> 02:04:12.112
Why did you believe in it so much?

1095
02:04:13.322 --> 02:04:15.658
Cos we weren't made for the sea.

1096
02:04:17.201 --> 02:04:19.995
We've got our hands and our feet.

1097
02:04:20.496 --> 02:04:22.456
We're supposed to walk.

1098
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:28.170
I miss her sound.

1099
02:04:31.090 --> 02:04:32.883
Don't you?

1100
02:04:33.008 --> 02:04:35.260
Might get some hydro out of this.

1101
02:04:35.386 --> 02:04:37.388
I can't go on.

1102
02:04:39.473 --> 02:04:42.601
Not without her, or Dryland.

1103
02:04:42.726 --> 02:04:46.105
I don't want to live
if there's nothing left,

1104
02:04:47.272 --> 02:04:49.191
there's no hope.

1105
02:04:49.316 --> 02:04:51.068
You're still here.

1106
02:04:58.242 --> 02:05:00.536
Thank you for saving me.

1107
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:02.705
You can thank the Ancients.

1108
02:05:04.123 --> 02:05:08.669
- This is what they had.
- This is what they made of it.

1109
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.047
That's why I am what I am.

1110
02:05:12.172 --> 02:05:14.633
I may not be human, but I don't quit.

1111
02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:17.136
Never have.

1112
02:05:18.137 --> 02:05:20.556
No matter what they throw at me, I...

1113
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:54.131
(Gregor) Helen!

1114
02:05:54.256 --> 02:05:56.216
Helen!

1115
02:05:56.341 --> 02:05:59.344
No, no, no, no! Helen, up! Above you!

1116
02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:01.972
(Helen) Gregor!

1117
02:06:03.307 --> 02:06:05.100
(Gregor laughs)

1118
02:06:06.393 --> 02:06:09.063
Smart thinking to burn your boat!

1119
02:06:09.188 --> 02:06:12.983
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

1120
02:06:13.108 --> 02:06:17.696
Who's that with you?
Ichthys sapien! Is that really you?

1121
02:06:18.906 --> 02:06:22.826
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

1122
02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.121
Helen!

1123
02:06:27.539 --> 02:06:30.542
- Where's Enola?
- Smokers took her.

1124
02:06:31.627 --> 02:06:33.796
They'd have me, too,
if it weren't for him.

1125
02:06:33.921 --> 02:06:35.339
My friend,

1126
02:06:35.464 --> 02:06:38.258
thank you. Very human of you.

1127
02:06:39.259 --> 02:06:41.887
Grab your things quickly. Quickly.

1128
02:06:42.012 --> 02:06:43.013
Come.

1129
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:52.606
You see? Right down there.

1130
02:06:52.731 --> 02:06:56.527
There's several other survivors.
We'll just start over again.

1131
02:06:59.196 --> 02:07:03.200
Don't worry. They'll welcome you,
just like Gregor did.

1132
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:21.760
(Man) You can't ask us to go and get her.

1133
02:07:21.885 --> 02:07:24.930
(Woman) Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble. Forget it!

1134
02:07:25.055 --> 02:07:28.725
(Helen) They need to find Dryland
just like we do.

1135
02:07:28.851 --> 02:07:30.811
Of course.

1136
02:07:30.936 --> 02:07:33.564
(Helen) If the Mariner's willing to go
after her, then why not us?

1137
02:07:33.689 --> 02:07:37.734
(Woman) We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

1138
02:07:38.986 --> 02:07:40.571
Helen...

1139
02:07:40.696 --> 02:07:43.615
The papers the Mariner brought you.

1140
02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:47.619
It's the same language
the tattoo is written in.

1141
02:07:47.744 --> 02:07:50.539
86...56.

1142
02:07:50.664 --> 02:07:56.044
27, 59. If I can figure out
what these numbers refer to...

1143
02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:58.338
- They refer to nothing.
- What?

1144
02:07:58.463 --> 02:08:01.258
Dryland doesn't exist.

1145
02:08:01.383 --> 02:08:03.218
(Man) You're as crazy as she is!

1146
02:08:03.343 --> 02:08:08.473
We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers
will come. We need to be moving now.

1147
02:08:08.599 --> 02:08:12.436
- We need this child to find Dryland!
- I'm not going.

1148
02:08:12.561 --> 02:08:16.481
- (Man) I say let him go.
- (Woman) We're better off without them!

1149
02:08:24.489 --> 02:08:26.575
You won't go after her either?

1150
02:08:30.537 --> 02:08:34.041
- I thought you were different.
- I am different.

1151
02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:38.503
(Man) Hey, hey! That's my sail!

1152
02:08:39.671 --> 02:08:41.798
- What's he doing?
- Leaving.

1153
02:08:41.924 --> 02:08:43.842
Not in one of our boats!

1154
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:48.138
You can give it to him or he'll take it.

1155
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:04.488
Enola said you were her friend.

1156
02:09:04.613 --> 02:09:06.615
What do I tell her when I see her again?

1157
02:09:08.659 --> 02:09:10.035
Lies.

1158
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.748
If it makes you feel better.

1159
02:09:27.761 --> 02:09:31.974
Don't blame him.
Survival is all he knows.

1160
02:09:32.099 --> 02:09:35.686
That's why someday there will be
so many like him,

1161
02:09:35.811 --> 02:09:38.772
probably so few of us.

1162
02:11:21.666 --> 02:11:23.668
(Engines roar)

1163
02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:35.889
- What do you want?
- Uh, all kinds of things.

1164
02:11:37.057 --> 02:11:39.226
But, uh, right now

1165
02:11:40.227 --> 02:11:44.147
we'll settle for everything you've got.
Ain't that right, Bones?

1166
02:11:44.272 --> 02:11:47.984
(Man) You destroyed our homes!
Why can't you leave us alone?

1167
02:11:48.110 --> 02:11:51.363
I don't know.
It's a character thing, I guess.

1168
02:11:52.364 --> 02:11:54.366
Ain't that right, Bones?

1169
02:11:55.534 --> 02:11:56.910
Bones?

1170
02:11:57.494 --> 02:11:59.121
Bones?

1171
02:12:16.096 --> 02:12:18.348
I'm going after Enola.

1172
02:12:26.523 --> 02:12:31.278
Here, you know,
for a hideous freak, you're OK.

1173
02:12:32.487 --> 02:12:34.406
It was a joke!

1174
02:12:35.282 --> 02:12:38.994
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

1175
02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:43.039
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location.

1176
02:12:43.165 --> 02:12:46.626
Latitude, longitude.
It doesn't make sense, though.

1177
02:12:46.751 --> 02:12:49.421
The numbers,
they seem to be backwards or something.

1178
02:12:49.546 --> 02:12:52.757
- It's upside down.
- The world?

1179
02:12:52.883 --> 02:12:56.970
- The poles have reversed themselves?
- I've been mapping the cities below.

1180
02:12:59.431 --> 02:13:02.976
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

1181
02:13:03.101 --> 02:13:05.896
- (Man) That's blasphemy!
- No, it's true.

1182
02:13:06.021 --> 02:13:09.399
I've seen it with my own eyes.
There's land.

1183
02:13:09.524 --> 02:13:13.236
- Right under our keel. None of it's dry.
- Some is.

1184
02:13:14.738 --> 02:13:19.284
Enola's been there. I know that now.
I saw what she drew.

1185
02:13:19.409 --> 02:13:23.205
That's why he's going after Enola.
To find Dryland.

1186
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:25.957
I don't care about Dryland.

1187
02:13:26.082 --> 02:13:29.669
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

1188
02:13:29.794 --> 02:13:33.340
He doesn't even know
which direction they came from.

1189
02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:54.653
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

1190
02:14:02.327 --> 02:14:06.790
(Woman) Forget about the Muto, Helen!
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

1191
02:14:06.915 --> 02:14:10.585
We've got to go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

1192
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:14.756
Don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

1193
02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:32.649
- Hey, Doc, what's this?
- Where?

1194
02:14:32.774 --> 02:14:36.111
- Above the squiggle. Looks like a star.
- Or a meteor.

1195
02:14:36.236 --> 02:14:37.779
It's a mole.

1196
02:14:37.904 --> 02:14:42.534
- You got that tattoo figured out yet?
- It'd be easier if it was flat.

1197
02:14:42.659 --> 02:14:45.245
Big and flat. It needs to be flat.

1198
02:14:45.370 --> 02:14:49.165
- What have you got in mind?
- Well, you cut it off her back,

1199
02:14:49.291 --> 02:14:51.876
stretch it, mount it,
give us a proper look.

1200
02:14:52.002 --> 02:14:54.212
(Deacon)
Take her down below until I holler.

1201
02:14:55.422 --> 02:14:58.008
Saint Joe, we're close.

1202
02:14:59.509 --> 02:15:01.803
After centuries of shame.

1203
02:15:57.609 --> 02:15:59.653
(Distant echoing voices)

1204
02:16:32.227 --> 02:16:34.229
(Laughter and yelling)

1205
02:16:38.650 --> 02:16:42.529
- They're getting ugly.
- Don't I know it.

1206
02:16:42.654 --> 02:16:44.906
Announce me, cousin.

1207
02:16:49.285 --> 02:16:52.080
- Hey, here he is.
- (Crowd roars)

1208
02:16:52.205 --> 02:16:55.792
Rise up, brothers and sisters,

1209
02:16:57.293 --> 02:16:59.295
turn your eyes

1210
02:16:59.421 --> 02:17:03.049
and open your hearts
to your humble benefactor,

1211
02:17:03.174 --> 02:17:07.011
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

1212
02:17:07.137 --> 02:17:10.098
the Deacon of the 'Dez!

1213
02:17:10.223 --> 02:17:12.308
(Crowd roars)

1214
02:18:02.192 --> 02:18:04.027
(Deacon) Children,

1215
02:18:04.152 --> 02:18:06.529
children of the provider,

1216
02:18:07.906 --> 02:18:12.619
citizens of the good ship,
please now, hear me speak.

1217
02:18:16.873 --> 02:18:19.834
- I've had a vision.
- (Man) We're tired of your visions!

1218
02:18:19.959 --> 02:18:22.212
What about the land you promised us?

1219
02:18:22.337 --> 02:18:24.088
(Crowd cheers)

1220
02:18:24.214 --> 02:18:26.174
- Yeah!
- (Deacon) Oh, ye of little faith.

1221
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:29.719
I've had a vision so great,

1222
02:18:29.844 --> 02:18:32.722
that as it came to me, I wept.

1223
02:18:32.847 --> 02:18:38.353
- And in this splenditudinous...
- (Smoker) Is that Bone's vehicle?

1224
02:18:38.478 --> 02:18:42.649
(Deacon) I saw - and you know
what it is that I saw.

1225
02:18:43.608 --> 02:18:45.151
I saw...

1226
02:18:46.402 --> 02:18:48.863
- the land.
- (Cheering)

1227
02:19:15.265 --> 02:19:17.267
(Crowd chanting)

1228
02:19:28.069 --> 02:19:31.406
- Horse, is that you?
- (Jet ski engine revs)

1229
02:19:35.869 --> 02:19:39.539
Look, just bring it in slow, OK?
I don't have all day.

1230
02:19:39.664 --> 02:19:40.957
(Engine revs)

1231
02:19:41.082 --> 02:19:42.542
Horse!

1232
02:19:42.667 --> 02:19:45.295
Just bring it up slow.

1233
02:19:46.296 --> 02:19:48.006
I said slow!

1234
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:09.777
You killed Smitty, cousin.

1235
02:20:13.406 --> 02:20:15.950
- Nice landing!
- (Laughter)

1236
02:20:16.075 --> 02:20:18.912
Smitty, man, always in the way!

1237
02:20:22.206 --> 02:20:24.626
Smitty? I quit!

1238
02:20:26.544 --> 02:20:28.713
I'm in charge now, baby!

1239
02:20:28.838 --> 02:20:31.591
Yeah, I'm in charge.

1240
02:20:31.716 --> 02:20:34.177
I'm in charge!

1241
02:20:40.224 --> 02:20:43.853
(Deacon)
'And he said this to me personally.

1242
02:20:45.647 --> 02:20:49.776
'We are to go there
and we are to settle it.

1243
02:20:49.901 --> 02:20:52.111
'And we are to build the...'

1244
02:20:53.071 --> 02:20:57.075
You shouldn't be doing that.
You're going to get in trouble.

1245
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.118
Huh! That's right.

1246
02:20:59.243 --> 02:21:03.665
You're not afraid. You've got
your pet freak coming to rescue you.

1247
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:06.209
He's not a freak
and he can take you any time!

1248
02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:12.632
He's killed dozens of people.
He doesn't have any mercy or anything.

1249
02:21:12.757 --> 02:21:14.676
He even kills little girls.

1250
02:21:16.594 --> 02:21:18.137
Haven't we all?

1251
02:21:20.139 --> 02:21:21.182
Dang!

1252
02:21:22.392 --> 02:21:23.476
It's Horse.

1253
02:21:25.770 --> 02:21:28.314
Find him! Find him!

1254
02:21:30.233 --> 02:21:32.694
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1255
02:21:32.819 --> 02:21:36.406
- Come on.
- Getting nervous, aren't you?

1256
02:21:40.368 --> 02:21:42.370
I don't get nervous.

1257
02:21:43.871 --> 02:21:46.708
(Deacon)
And if there's a river, we'll dam it!

1258
02:21:46.833 --> 02:21:50.461
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it!

1259
02:21:51.462 --> 02:21:54.132
Cos I'm talkin' progress here!

1260
02:21:54.257 --> 02:21:55.675
Yes, sir!

1261
02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:58.803
- I'm talkin' development!
- Yeah!

1262
02:21:58.928 --> 02:22:03.266
We shall suck and savor
the sweet flavor

1263
02:22:03.391 --> 02:22:05.935
of Dryland.

1264
02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:07.937
(Enola) Your face is all red.

1265
02:22:09.522 --> 02:22:14.110
Helen said anybody that has a face
that red has either had too much sun

1266
02:22:14.235 --> 02:22:17.447
- or too much to drink.
- All right, that's it.

1267
02:22:17.572 --> 02:22:20.491
- I'm gonna burn your face!
- All right.

1268
02:22:20.616 --> 02:22:24.620
- What's up?
- We're just talking about her friend.

1269
02:22:26.039 --> 02:22:28.833
- What's his name?
- He doesn't have a name.

1270
02:22:28.958 --> 02:22:33.337
- So Death can't find him.
- (Mocking noises)

1271
02:22:36.841 --> 02:22:39.927
He doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

1272
02:22:40.928 --> 02:22:43.723
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

1273
02:22:43.848 --> 02:22:46.768
He's fast and strong like a big wind.

1274
02:22:47.769 --> 02:22:51.564
He can hear 100 miles
and see 100 miles underwater.

1275
02:22:51.689 --> 02:22:54.192
He can hide in the shadow of a noon sun.

1276
02:22:54.984 --> 02:22:59.197
He could be right behind you and you won't
even know it till you're dead!

1277
02:23:00.656 --> 02:23:02.575
Give it a rest.

1278
02:23:04.077 --> 02:23:07.497
- He'll come for me. He will.
- Yeah?

1279
02:23:08.664 --> 02:23:10.625
Well, I hope he does.

1280
02:23:14.170 --> 02:23:16.130
Remember you said that.

1281
02:23:17.507 --> 02:23:20.051
(Deacon) Look at us.

1282
02:23:20.176 --> 02:23:22.303
Look at us here today.

1283
02:23:22.428 --> 02:23:26.015
Dryland is not just our destination,

1284
02:23:26.849 --> 02:23:29.769
but it is our destiny!

1285
02:23:31.145 --> 02:23:33.106
(Speech continues)

1286
02:23:38.069 --> 02:23:40.446
Find him! Find him!

1287
02:23:40.571 --> 02:23:44.951
How can I find this glorious place?

1288
02:23:45.952 --> 02:23:48.079
And he said to me,

1289
02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:50.915
"A child

1290
02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:53.501
"shall lead you."

1291
02:23:54.502 --> 02:23:56.295
A child.

1292
02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:58.756
- And behold...
- It's time.

1293
02:23:58.881 --> 02:24:01.843
The instrument of our salvation!

1294
02:24:03.845 --> 02:24:05.721
(Crowd roars)

1295
02:24:09.433 --> 02:24:11.853
Our guide in the wild!

1296
02:24:11.978 --> 02:24:14.313
Our beacon in the darkness!

1297
02:24:14.438 --> 02:24:16.524
Turn her around, Nord.

1298
02:24:16.649 --> 02:24:19.152
She has shown me the path!

1299
02:24:23.447 --> 02:24:27.076
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

1300
02:24:27.201 --> 02:24:30.580
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe!

1301
02:24:33.875 --> 02:24:37.461
And let's get this tub of shit
up to speed!

1302
02:24:39.547 --> 02:24:42.049
(Chaotic yelling)

1303
02:24:43.259 --> 02:24:44.385
Yep.

1304
02:25:23.299 --> 02:25:26.677
- Stroke!
- Pull!

1305
02:25:27.929 --> 02:25:29.138
Stroke!

1306
02:25:29.263 --> 02:25:31.057
Pull!

1307
02:25:32.516 --> 02:25:34.393
Stroke!

1308
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:39.523
(Galley master) Stroke!

1309
02:25:41.317 --> 02:25:42.944
Stroke!

1310
02:25:50.576 --> 02:25:53.412
- So which way are we rowing?
- I don't have a goddamn clue!

1311
02:25:53.537 --> 02:25:58.960
Don't worry. They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm faking it.

1312
02:25:59.085 --> 02:26:02.922
- But, um... Why?
- Oh, you want details?

1313
02:26:03.047 --> 02:26:07.134
Well, I'm not telling these savages
we haven't solved the map yet.

1314
02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:12.306
I promised them results and I'll get 'em
if I gotta cut 'em out of her back!

1315
02:26:14.183 --> 02:26:17.186
Who is that? Who is that?

1316
02:26:18.354 --> 02:26:20.690
(Man) Maybe one of the spare rowers?

1317
02:26:28.572 --> 02:26:31.367
Why aren't you rowing?

1318
02:26:40.001 --> 02:26:42.336
- It's him!
- It is him.

1319
02:26:43.337 --> 02:26:46.340
You guys are in so much trouble.

1320
02:26:49.051 --> 02:26:52.430
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

1321
02:26:53.431 --> 02:26:55.433
He's like a turd that won't flush.

1322
02:26:56.559 --> 02:26:58.436
I want the girl.

1323
02:27:02.606 --> 02:27:07.069
You know,
I thought you were stupid, friend.

1324
02:27:08.195 --> 02:27:10.656
But I underestimated you.

1325
02:27:10.781 --> 02:27:13.784
You are a total freakin' retard!

1326
02:27:13.909 --> 02:27:15.911
(Maniacal laughter)

1327
02:27:17.038 --> 02:27:20.124
I want the girl. That's all.

1328
02:27:20.249 --> 02:27:23.961
What on this screwed-up earth
makes you think you're going to get her?

1329
02:27:33.471 --> 02:27:35.473
You know what this is?

1330
02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:42.021
I drop it, you burn.

1331
02:27:42.146 --> 02:27:44.398
We all burn.

1332
02:27:44.523 --> 02:27:46.484
No, wait, wait, wait.

1333
02:27:47.234 --> 02:27:49.779
Let's not do anything rash here.

1334
02:27:49.904 --> 02:27:53.157
I mean, are you sure she's worth all this?

1335
02:27:53.282 --> 02:27:56.702
She never does stop talking.
She never shuts up.

1336
02:27:56.827 --> 02:27:58.788
- I noticed.
- What is it, then?

1337
02:27:58.913 --> 02:28:01.207
Huh? It's the map.

1338
02:28:02.208 --> 02:28:03.876
She's my friend.

1339
02:28:05.586 --> 02:28:08.798
Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

1340
02:28:08.923 --> 02:28:11.509
You're gonna die for your friend.

1341
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:14.678
If it comes to that.

1342
02:28:17.014 --> 02:28:18.641
He's bluffing! I'll kill him.

1343
02:28:18.766 --> 02:28:22.645
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.
- Shut up!

1344
02:28:24.063 --> 02:28:27.817
You know, I don't think you're going to
drop that torch, my friend.

1345
02:28:28.818 --> 02:28:32.613
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

1346
02:28:36.492 --> 02:28:38.244
No!

1347
02:28:46.293 --> 02:28:48.045
Oh, thank God.

1348
02:28:52.758 --> 02:28:54.260
Aargh!

1349
02:29:00.724 --> 02:29:02.726
(Heavy gunfire)

1350
02:29:05.896 --> 02:29:08.149
(Man) Look out!

1351
02:29:08.274 --> 02:29:10.693
Get him!

1352
02:29:10.818 --> 02:29:13.028
Let's go, goddamnit!

1353
02:29:14.363 --> 02:29:15.739
(Man screams)

1354
02:29:15.865 --> 02:29:19.118
Don't just stand there - kill something!

1355
02:29:22.121 --> 02:29:24.248
Was this your big vision?

1356
02:29:31.255 --> 02:29:32.840
Aaargh!

1357
02:29:32.965 --> 02:29:34.467
Ah!

1358
02:29:34.592 --> 02:29:36.844
I've always wanted to drive this monster!

1359
02:29:39.263 --> 02:29:42.057
(Man) There he is! There he is!

1360
02:29:46.437 --> 02:29:48.189
That's him there!

1361
02:29:51.025 --> 02:29:52.026
Aargh!

1362
02:29:56.739 --> 02:29:57.740
Aaaargh!

1363
02:30:08.834 --> 02:30:10.836
(Enola) Let me go!

1364
02:30:10.961 --> 02:30:12.963
Let go!

1365
02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:20.221
(Explosion)

1366
02:30:22.139 --> 02:30:23.516
Let me go!

1367
02:30:27.811 --> 02:30:30.272
(Enola) Let me go! Let go!

1368
02:30:30.397 --> 02:30:32.233
Let me go!

1369
02:30:33.108 --> 02:30:35.861
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:30:38.864 --> 02:30:41.617
Let me go! Let go!

1371
02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:48.332
(Laughs)
You should have stayed on the water.

1372
02:30:48.457 --> 02:30:50.251
(Clicks)

1373
02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:01.345
You know how to fly an airplane?
You're lucky I do.

1374
02:31:01.470 --> 02:31:05.224
Ow! Now you stop it!
You behave yourself now!

1375
02:32:00.279 --> 02:32:01.447
Up!

1376
02:32:31.101 --> 02:32:32.895
(Explosion)

1377
02:32:41.445 --> 02:32:43.947
It's going down. It's sinking!

1378
02:32:44.073 --> 02:32:48.661
- Gregor, bring us right down on top.
- Hurry, Gregor!

1379
02:32:48.786 --> 02:32:50.913
- (Gregor) Don't worry!
- Hurry.

1380
02:32:55.918 --> 02:32:57.836
(Hull creaks)

1381
02:33:05.469 --> 02:33:07.846
Enola! Up here! Grab on!

1382
02:33:14.186 --> 02:33:15.854
Are they on yet?

1383
02:33:19.358 --> 02:33:22.027
- What is it?
- I don't know!

1384
02:33:23.237 --> 02:33:25.114
No!

1385
02:33:34.039 --> 02:33:38.585
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip
your cute little lungs out!

1386
02:33:42.423 --> 02:33:44.341
Aaaah!

1387
02:33:47.928 --> 02:33:49.430
Aaargh!

1388
02:33:52.474 --> 02:33:54.977
Pull! Almost!

1389
02:34:00.274 --> 02:34:02.276
(Gregor laughs)

1390
02:34:03.402 --> 02:34:04.987
(Explosion)

1391
02:34:34.099 --> 02:34:35.100
No!

1392
02:34:35.225 --> 02:34:37.770
- Aaaaargh!
- No! Enola!

1393
02:34:40.314 --> 02:34:42.566
Saint Joe! Hole in one.

1394
02:34:42.691 --> 02:34:45.110
- Helen!
- Enola!

1395
02:34:45.235 --> 02:34:47.696
- (Gregor) Helen!
- Hey!

1396
02:34:47.821 --> 02:34:49.198
Hey!

1397
02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.247
If I can't have Dryland, no one will!

1398
02:35:00.751 --> 02:35:04.713
Oh... Oh, no, quick!
What are we going to do?

1399
02:35:08.091 --> 02:35:09.176
Tie this off!

1400
02:35:14.056 --> 02:35:15.808
Hurry! Tie it!

1401
02:35:21.438 --> 02:35:23.941
- Got it!
- Ah!

1402
02:35:27.069 --> 02:35:28.987
Aaaargh!

1403
02:35:36.912 --> 02:35:38.831
Get them up now!

1404
02:35:45.921 --> 02:35:47.714
(Straining)

1405
02:35:56.139 --> 02:35:58.141
Of course.

1406
02:36:00.227 --> 02:36:02.145
Of course, the numbers.

1407
02:36:02.271 --> 02:36:04.481
The numbers! They...

1408
02:36:04.606 --> 02:36:07.276
(Giggling) That must be it!

1409
02:36:07.401 --> 02:36:08.944
What?

1410
02:36:09.069 --> 02:36:12.531
- I was swimming.
- I saw.

1411
02:36:12.656 --> 02:36:14.908
(Gregor) My friends, my friends, look!

1412
02:36:15.033 --> 02:36:18.161
Look, this map...

1413
02:36:19.246 --> 02:36:23.500
This map, it bears a grid system
with numbers the Ancients used

1414
02:36:23.625 --> 02:36:26.295
to determine geographic location
on the world,

1415
02:36:26.420 --> 02:36:30.090
just like the numbers and symbols
on Enola's back.

1416
02:36:31.967 --> 02:36:36.430
First, they would determine
the angle of the sun using this

1417
02:36:36.555 --> 02:36:41.059
and that would tell them where they were
and which direction they had to go.

1418
02:36:42.686 --> 02:36:47.733
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the co-ordinates on Enola's back,

1419
02:36:50.485 --> 02:36:52.362
then Dryland is that way!

1420
02:36:52.487 --> 02:36:54.072
(He chuckles)

1421
02:38:01.974 --> 02:38:04.059
(Seagulls cry)

1422
02:38:56.028 --> 02:38:59.698
- (Helen laughs)
- It's fresh! All of this!

1423
02:38:59.823 --> 02:39:01.616
It's fresh!

1424
02:39:04.327 --> 02:39:06.329
(Gregor laughs)

1425
02:39:07.789 --> 02:39:09.791
(Helen) Come on!

1426
02:39:14.963 --> 02:39:16.089
Woo!

1427
02:39:17.257 --> 02:39:19.968
I've found something!

1428
02:40:17.692 --> 02:40:20.946
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.

1429
02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:23.532
I think it was their way.

1430
02:40:25.659 --> 02:40:27.744
(Gregor)
They must have known they were dying.

1431
02:40:27.869 --> 02:40:29.746
(Helen laughs)

1432
02:40:52.269 --> 02:40:54.437
(Music box plays)

1433
02:40:58.441 --> 02:41:00.277
I'm home.

1434
02:41:11.079 --> 02:41:14.374
- Where's the Mariner?
- He was outside.

1435
02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:21.756
Wait! Wait, I want to show you this.

1436
02:41:37.397 --> 02:41:39.399
(Thunder of hooves)

1437
02:41:43.069 --> 02:41:44.905
(Whinnying)

1438
02:41:54.039 --> 02:41:56.249
(Chorus of bird calls)

1439
02:42:39.459 --> 02:42:42.337
First time in your life you got nothing
to say?

1440
02:42:56.476 --> 02:42:58.853
Enola, I have to go now.

1441
02:42:59.854 --> 02:43:02.148
But you came back for me.

1442
02:43:03.483 --> 02:43:05.402
I like you.

1443
02:43:10.657 --> 02:43:12.617
Why are you leaving?

1444
02:43:16.121 --> 02:43:20.041
- I don't belong here. I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1445
02:43:22.043 --> 02:43:25.463
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1446
02:43:25.588 --> 02:43:28.883
Helen said that it's only landsickness.

1447
02:43:29.592 --> 02:43:31.928
We're all feeling it. It'll go away soon.

1448
02:43:33.638 --> 02:43:35.598
It's more than that.

1449
02:44:22.395 --> 02:44:24.397
Well, goodbye, my friend.

1450
02:44:27.317 --> 02:44:29.778
Oh, I have something for you.

1451
02:44:31.154 --> 02:44:32.989
It's dirt!

1452
02:44:34.157 --> 02:44:36.785
Don't trade it all in one place.

1453
02:44:38.536 --> 02:44:42.665
Or do! It will give you reason
to come back for more!

1454
02:44:42.791 --> 02:44:44.793
(Gregor laughs)

1455
02:44:46.461 --> 02:44:50.382
- It's all I got, Drifter.
- It's enough.

1456
02:44:59.933 --> 02:45:03.103
Is it that easy for you
to just drift away?

1457
02:45:03.228 --> 02:45:05.397
I never said it was easy.

1458
02:45:07.732 --> 02:45:09.734
I don't understand.

1459
02:45:15.323 --> 02:45:17.283
I don't understand.

1460
02:45:18.410 --> 02:45:20.412
I mean, you brought us here.

1461
02:45:20.537 --> 02:45:23.123
You belong here as much as anyone.
Maybe more.

1462
02:45:29.003 --> 02:45:33.299
What do you think you're going to find?
What are you looking for out there?

1463
02:45:33.425 --> 02:45:37.053
Gregor once said there might be
others like me somewhere.

1464
02:45:39.597 --> 02:45:42.058
I have to know.

1465
02:45:43.643 --> 02:45:45.478
Helen, if...

1466
02:45:45.603 --> 02:45:48.690
If I find any others out there like you,

1467
02:45:50.358 --> 02:45:52.360
I'll tell them about this place

1468
02:45:52.485 --> 02:45:57.282
and how one woman with hope and courage
found it.

1469
02:46:37.197 --> 02:46:39.866
I have something for you.

1470
02:46:40.617 --> 02:46:44.913
- Something you'll need on your journey.
- I don't have much to barter with.

1471
02:46:45.038 --> 02:46:47.040
It's no trade. It's a gift.

1472
02:46:48.124 --> 02:46:52.295
- No such thing in Waterworld.
- Well, then, let this be the first.

1473
02:46:54.214 --> 02:46:56.049
It's a name.

1474
02:46:57.050 --> 02:47:01.012
It's from an old story about a great
warrior returning from battle.

1475
02:47:01.137 --> 02:47:04.933
He just set sail
and the water god cursed him,

1476
02:47:05.058 --> 02:47:07.685
and for the next ten years
he drifted on the seas.

1477
02:47:07.810 --> 02:47:11.523
The warrior drifted on the seas,
unable to find his way home,

1478
02:47:11.648 --> 02:47:14.067
until finally the gods took pity on him.

1479
02:47:14.192 --> 02:47:17.403
And they called up a warm wind
that blew him home.

1480
02:47:17.529 --> 02:47:19.614
To his family.

1481
02:47:20.823 --> 02:47:23.243
And he never left them again.

1482
02:47:25.703 --> 02:47:28.373
His name was Ulysses.

1483
02:47:31.501 --> 02:47:33.461
It's a good name.

1484
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:24.345
(Panting)
