LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS (2010)

2
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.354
Whoo!

3
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:43.229
Oh, yeah! Yeah, you want to dance?

4
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:45.428
You don't mind if I get up in there, do you?

5
00:00:47.273 --> 00:00:50.139
- This is kind of sexy.
- Yeah. Love it!

6
00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:51.676
You're kind of sexy.

7
00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:54.837
You should take one of these.
Very lightweight on your shoulders, ladies.

8
00:00:54.913 --> 00:00:58.406
Try it out, try it out. There you go.
Feels good, yeah?

9
00:00:58.484 --> 00:00:59.473
Whoo!

10
00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:01.418
Whoo!

11
00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:03.619
Here.

12
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.749
Follow me, ladies.
Follow me to the cash register.

13
00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:09.160
I see you guys.
You guys look like you smoke weed, right?

14
00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:11.423
Okay, you're gonna smoke a bowl,
you're gonna buy one of these TVs.

15
00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:13.488
Philips, all right.
You know, you're kind of high, feels good.

16
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.295
Samsung, kind of last year.

17
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.995
Magnavox, bam!

18
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.594
That's an explosion!
You're stoned, it'll blow your mind!

19
00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:21.538
You want to go really small, I got this one.

20
00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:24.633
Really small. Look at this flip-phone. Look.

21
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.079
"Hello, Joan. What are you doing?"

22
00:01:27.147 --> 00:01:30.047
- "I don't know. What are you doing?"
- "I'm great. "

23
00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:41.193
- You are so bad.
- Guys? Christy.

24
00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:43.055
Hey.

25
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.299
Said one, two princes kneel before you

26
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.895
That's what I said now

27
00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:55.333
Here, take my card. Take my card.

28
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:00.536
Take my card. Okay? Take my card.

29
00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.153
Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

30
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.246
In the house. Go, Joan. Go, Joan.

31
00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:13.025
Oh. Sorry, Joan.

32
00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:20.997
Okay, squeeze the nipple.
Squeeze the nipple. Harder.

33
00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.562
Okay. Oh, my God!

34
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:27.205
- What are you doing?
- Feel that.

35
00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:32.305
We can't do this. Jerry's right out there.

36
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:33.370
He can watch.

37
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.545
What makes you so damn sexy?

38
00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:39.011
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:44.249
I promise you, man,

40
00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:46.954
80 watts is more than
you'll ever need for a living room.

41
00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:48.995
Excuse me.

42
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:54.368
- Hello?
- Oh, Jesus. Harder.

43
00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:55.761
Oh!

44
00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:58.101
- Okay. Oh!
- What the...

45
00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.266
You fucking piece of shit!

46
00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:01.742
You fucked up son of a bitch!

47
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.971
Christy! What the hell is wrong with you?

48
00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:06.345
- How can I ever trust you again?
- I don't know. I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.713
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- No, I...

50
00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:10.378
You know, Fujitsu makes the same unit
for 40 bucks less.

51
00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:12.546
- Really?
- Yeah, but they don't sell it here.

52
00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:13.953
Oh...

53
00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:16.924
But I could get it for you, if you want.

54
00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:18.153
Oh! Are you, like, okay?

55
00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:20.987
Oh.

56
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.497
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57
00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:24.055
Give me your number.
I'll let you know when I have it.

58
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.190
Um...

59
00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:27.030
- What's your name?
- Amber.

60
00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:28.866
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Shut the fuck up, Christy!

61
00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:30.564
You.

62
00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:33.332
Don't you ever fucking come in here again!

63
00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.402
You know what? You owe me commission
on $54,000 worth of second-rate,

64
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.246
knock-off, gray-market, off-brand,
overpriced equipment, you son of a bitch.

65
00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:42.308
I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit!

66
00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:43.580
You know what?
Why don't you just send it to me?

67
00:03:43.654 --> 00:03:44.678
Christy knows the address.

68
00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.123
Amber! 434-6603!

69
00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:53.623
Why don't you tell Daddy

70
00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:55.893
what a downtown Chicago hospital
is really like?

71
00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:59.767
Patient brought in with chills,
nausea, ischemia, clearly in shock.

72
00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.100
Did you do a CBC?

73
00:04:01.172 --> 00:04:04.265
Excuse me, our protocols didn't
exist when you went to medical school.

74
00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:07.675
Oh! Yes, I've been under a rock
these past 30 years.

75
00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.613
How many transdermal intubations
have you personally done?

76
00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:14.812
My dear, I teach medicine. I no longer
sully my hands touching actual patients.

77
00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:16.477
- Ha!
- Touch patients?

78
00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.146
Why would anybody want to do that?

79
00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:20.214
You are not allowed in this conversation.

80
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.486
Excuse me. I've helped more patients
than you ever will.

81
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.891
Can I pour this drink on your head?

82
00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:25.760
What is wrong with getting rich?

83
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.798
God only knows you can't do that
in medicine anymore.

84
00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:30.734
- He's right about that!
- Don't help him justify his laziness.

85
00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.963
I already justified my laziness.

86
00:04:33.037 --> 00:04:36.337
It's called $35 million on my first IPO.

87
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:37.897
Jamie, help me.

88
00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:41.413
- He's a geek who got lucky.
- And he'll always be a geek.

89
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.414
Yeah? Well, this geek
is taking back your shares.

90
00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:44.540
I don't blame you.

91
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.642
The profession was ruined
when they let women in.

92
00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.743
I'm killing both of you.

93
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.256
I'm killing all of you
if you don't get in there and sit down.

94
00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.883
And we get to keep all the shares.

95
00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:55.322
- Ugh!
- All right.

96
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.829
Jamie!

97
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.526
Of course, it really happened.

98
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:04.570
Who wants to see
a movie about protesting?

99
00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.265
Whatever.

100
00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.863
To the sale of Josh's company!

101
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.910
- Whatever the hell it does.
- Yes!

102
00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.803
Long live medical software.

103
00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:16.143
And med school dropouts everywhere.

104
00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:17.478
You'd better give
some of this money away,

105
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.985
- that's all I have to say.
- Not gonna happen.

106
00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.576
Jamie, what are you up to these days?

107
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:24.614
- Jamie's selling high-end stereo equipment.
- Ha!

108
00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.651
Not anymore.

109
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.522
What do you mean?

110
00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:33.931
Well, let's just say Jamie had
a falling out with management.

111
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.567
I thought you were in real estate.

112
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.666
I am looking for other opportunities.

113
00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:46.543
We're living through the greatest creation
of wealth in modern history,

114
00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:47.876
and my brother decides to quit.

115
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.254
Josh has been talking to me
about pharmaceutical sales.

116
00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:55.619
Pharmaceutical sales?

117
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.679
Pharmaceutical sales.

118
00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:59.522
You know, medicine that's
supposed to help people get better.

119
00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:02.085
Remember Timmy,
my roommate from Brown?

120
00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:04.223
He's a VP at Pfizer. So I said to Jamie,

121
00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:07.096
"Jamie, if you suck on my cock,
I'll get you an interview. "

122
00:06:07.235 --> 00:06:09.363
- Oh, Josh, watch your mouth!
- Watch your mouth!

123
00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:10.837
I said no, Mom. I said no.

124
00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.167
Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?

125
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:16.973
"Why would you wanna be
a pharmaceutical rep?"

126
00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:20.606
Because it's the only entry-level job in
America that pays over 100 grand a year.

127
00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:21.706
- That's why.
- No.

128
00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:24.547
Those people come into our office
with their roller bags and samples,

129
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.814
like door-to-door-salesmen.

130
00:06:25.888 --> 00:06:27.287
They are door-to-door-salesmen,

131
00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:29.791
only what they're selling
grosses $87 billion a year!

132
00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:31.689
Yeah, and they're turning
complex medical decisions

133
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.022
- into Madison Avenue impulse buying.
- Oh, my God.

134
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.461
Look, I'm not selling to the patients, okay?

135
00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:36.020
No. No, the patients just see
the commercials on TV...

136
00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:37.258
I'm not even doing the job yet!

137
00:06:37.332 --> 00:06:38.960
...and demand their name-brand drugs
from the doctors...

138
00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:41.560
Calm down, you're freaking out.
- ... and there you are to supply them.

139
00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:42.626
This is so crazy

140
00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:44.263
that you're yelling at me for nothing!
I'm not doing it!

141
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.710
If you barbarians won't be still
and finish this lamb,

142
00:06:51.047 --> 00:06:53.414
none of you will get the chocolate cake.

143
00:06:53.983 --> 00:06:55.780
Yes, Mom!

144
00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:06.193
Oh, Jamie,
if you could make money fucking,

145
00:07:06.262 --> 00:07:08.390
you'd be even richer than me.

146
00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:15.028
I'll call the Pfizer guy in the morning.

147
00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:20.403
Let's welcome the class of 1997 trainees!

148
00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:32.022
This is not a pill. This is tens
of millions of dollars in research.

149
00:07:32.356 --> 00:07:35.757
This is thousands of hours of hard labor.

150
00:07:35.826 --> 00:07:38.819
This, ladies and gentlemen, is software.

151
00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:40.820
Your training will last six weeks.

152
00:07:40.898 --> 00:07:44.801
Each of you will leave here
a fully qualified health care professional.

153
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:47.132
That's 33% fewer phone calls
for you at 4:00 a. m.

154
00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:49.605
That's 33% less angry... Shit!

155
00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:52.876
Your job will be to go fight illness.

156
00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:01.915
Hello... Fuck!

157
00:08:02.455 --> 00:08:03.649
Shit!

158
00:08:04.456 --> 00:08:08.120
Ah! Fuck! Ah! Shit! Ow!

159
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:12.693
Off-label uses are benefits
not yet recognized by the FDA.

160
00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:17.195
But you can boost sales
by hinting at what these uses are.

161
00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:18.827
Hello, Doctor.
Do you know that prescribing Zithromax...

162
00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:20.496
Prescribing Zithromax...

163
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:23.172
Bonjour, Doctor!

164
00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:25.335
Prescribing Zithromax... Zithromax.

165
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:26.503
Ah!

166
00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:30.512
Zoloft, a drug approved solely
for the treatment of depression.

167
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:34.576
Off-label uses: alcoholism, bulimia, PMS,

168
00:08:34.654 --> 00:08:36.781
smoking, social anxiety.

169
00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:38.484
Is there a question?

170
00:08:41.827 --> 00:08:45.161
Zoloft has been associated
with suicidal ideation in teenagers.

171
00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:46.255
Unproven.

172
00:08:46.332 --> 00:08:47.527
Proven. Unreported.

173
00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:51.834
Your job will be to
go share this technology.

174
00:08:53.206 --> 00:08:56.369
Your job will be to go save lives.

175
00:08:57.045 --> 00:09:00.104
The health care industry today
is worth $2 trillion a year.

176
00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.940
The top 10 pharma companies
make more money

177
00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:07.977
than all 490 of the other
Fortune 500 companies combined.

178
00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:11.491
- What family is Feldene a part of?
- Non-steroidal...

179
00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:14.460
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
An NSAID.

180
00:09:17.565 --> 00:09:20.864
A better world, that's why we're here.

181
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.402
Lipitor in Palm Beach!

182
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:25.404
Xanax, New England!

183
00:09:27.642 --> 00:09:29.166
What about you, Jamie-bamie?

184
00:09:29.243 --> 00:09:32.270
Zoloft and Zithromax
in the Ohio River Valley.

185
00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:34.576
Welcome to Pfizer!

186
00:09:46.494 --> 00:09:48.861
What are you thinking about?

187
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:50.193
Money.

188
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.826
Pay attention.

189
00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:58.669
We are not going door-to-door selling
oatmeal cookies for the Girl Scouts here.

190
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.609
You are not the goddamn Avon lady.
You understand what I'm saying?

191
00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:05.675
This is hardcore sales,
and you have a quota.

192
00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:08.274
And people at the home office
keeping track of that quota.

193
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.784
And your cold calls, and your mileage,
and your receipts.

194
00:10:10.853 --> 00:10:12.481
How often you goddamn masturbate.

195
00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:13.954
What is the quota for masturbation?

196
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.888
You can masturbate
as much as you like, smartass,

197
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.326
as long as you make a lot of money.

198
00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:20.554
Okay.

199
00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:23.194
Voila!
Okay, now, remember.

200
00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:25.166
Hospitals have a no-reps policy.

201
00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:28.796
Doesn't mean we can't give the docs
a nice, dry walk from their cars.

202
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:30.870
All right?

203
00:10:31.308 --> 00:10:32.399
There he is. All right.

204
00:10:32.475 --> 00:10:33.533
No time like the present.

205
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.907
- Get your head in the game.
- All right.

206
00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:36.571
- Remember, Pfizer makes his life better.
- Okay.

207
00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:38.511
Pfizer makes his patients happier,

208
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:40.048
- so he makes more money.
- Okay.

209
00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:42.312
- Wait, the pens, the pens!
- Oh, the pens!

210
00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:43.375
Always lead with a pen.

211
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:45.915
Gifts establish reciprocity!

212
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:49.114
Doctor!

213
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.760
Hey, Doctor, Jamie Randall. Pfizer.
How are you doing?

214
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:53.626
- No, thank you.
- Look... It's wet out here.

215
00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:55.358
I don't want you compromising
your immune system.

216
00:10:55.432 --> 00:10:56.558
Let's talk about Zithromax for a second.

217
00:10:56.634 --> 00:10:58.067
Which part of "No, thank you"
do you not understand?

218
00:10:58.135 --> 00:10:59.261
- You wanna take a pen?
- No, thank you.

219
00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:00.530
Okay.

220
00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:06.034
That's 33% fewer phone calls for you
at 4:00 a. m.

221
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:07.100
Please stop, okay?

222
00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:08.611
That's why I wanna talk to you
about Zithromax, okay?

223
00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:10.738
We are throwing antibiotics at people
the minute they sneeze,

224
00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:11.840
and it doesn't work on viruses anyway.

225
00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:13.111
- What's your name?
- Goldstein.

226
00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:15.243
Right. Dr. Goldstein,
okay, what we're doing...

227
00:11:15.653 --> 00:11:18.487
No, what you're doing is creating
classes of drug-resistant superbugs.

228
00:11:18.557 --> 00:11:20.046
And that might be good for business,

229
00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:22.559
because you will develop
stronger antibiotics

230
00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:24.322
and ruin people's
immune systems altogether.

231
00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:26.023
- No... You...
- Thank you.

232
00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:41.177
Models. Beauty queens.

233
00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:44.346
Equestrian princesses. Shit.

234
00:11:44.583 --> 00:11:47.644
You know what I heard?
They're even starting to hire strippers.

235
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:50.149
I heard that.

236
00:11:54.427 --> 00:11:55.553
Hey, Lisa!

237
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:01.464
- Her name's not Lisa.
- I know. I know.

238
00:12:01.534 --> 00:12:03.525
But if every time I say, "Hey, Lisa,"

239
00:12:03.603 --> 00:12:05.799
then eventually she'll come up to me
and she'll be like, you know,

240
00:12:05.873 --> 00:12:10.469
"My name's not Lisa, it's Jennifer,"
or whatever, and I'll do a big apology

241
00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:14.843
and I'll say, "I thought you were the Lisa
who was mad at me for not calling. "

242
00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:17.440
And from then on, Jennifer,
or whatever her name is,

243
00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:20.816
will think that I dated a girl
who looked just like her, who I rejected.

244
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:23.118
She'll develop this unconscious need
to win my approval,

245
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.420
and from then on, it's cake.

246
00:12:27.494 --> 00:12:28.825
Damn!

247
00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:33.659
Accepted etiquette is one rep at a time.
Screw etiquette.

248
00:12:33.734 --> 00:12:37.261
Competing reps are not your friends.
Okay, Knight.

249
00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:38.861
- Where you going?
- Oh. Sorry.

250
00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:40.703
Knight is a doc you gotta close.

251
00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:42.105
Leads the largest group in the city.

252
00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:45.168
Lots of fucked-up college students
on Prozac who should be on Zoloft.

253
00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:46.474
You always bring donuts?

254
00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:48.309
Pharma sales is a lot like dating.

255
00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:51.284
They want you to take them to dinner
and pretend to expect nothing in return.

256
00:12:51.352 --> 00:12:53.649
- And no one ever got laid by going Dutch.
- Exactly.

257
00:12:55.423 --> 00:12:57.983
Gail, good morning!
How are you this fine day?

258
00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:07.792
Sick people touch those.

259
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.567
When I order a second test,
it's for a reason, God damn it.

260
00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:14.036
Unbelievable!

261
00:13:14.108 --> 00:13:16.771
That's him. Another time.

262
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.111
If they don't take us in five minutes,
we leave. Only losers wait.

263
00:13:23.184 --> 00:13:24.378
There he is.

264
00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:25.818
Hey there, beautiful. How you doing?

265
00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.285
Get over here, Trey.

266
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.325
Two tickets to La Bohème on the 19th.

267
00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:34.385
I hate you. Can't you go with me
instead of my husband?

268
00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:39.025
Trey Hannigan. Lilly's Prozac rep,
top 10 nationally. The Devil.

269
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.092
He's on the phone with Watson.
You can go on back.

270
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.604
He's the reason
we never make our quota on Zoloft.

271
00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.906
- Is he going in?
- What a dick!

272
00:13:48.978 --> 00:13:52.709
If we can show 5% gains monthly,
we're going to the promised land.

273
00:13:53.515 --> 00:13:55.177
The promised land?

274
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.718
Chicago.

275
00:13:56.786 --> 00:13:58.878
Civilization. Culture.

276
00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:01.856
And not incidentally, my wife and kids.

277
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.052
Only the great and near-great get Chicago,

278
00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:06.823
but I got a hunch
that you and your swinging dick

279
00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:08.557
might be my ticket to the big leagues.

280
00:14:19.844 --> 00:14:20.902
Good morning.

281
00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:23.571
Doctor only sees new reps
who bring a lunch.

282
00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:25.274
Here's a list of available dates.

283
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:27.180
- The first one is in five weeks.
- Great.

284
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:31.210
Here's a list of approved foods,
no sushi, no salads.

285
00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:32.482
No salads.

286
00:14:32.556 --> 00:14:34.683
Leave your samples with me.

287
00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:37.188
- Hi.
- Five weeks.

288
00:14:37.895 --> 00:14:38.988
You're going to like me.

289
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:41.055
I beg your pardon?

290
00:14:41.132 --> 00:14:43.760
Sooner or later, everybody does.
You wanna know why?

291
00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:47.236
'Cause I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen. I'm very trainable.

292
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:50.035
- What's your name?
- Gail. Five weeks.

293
00:14:50.108 --> 00:14:51.507
Oh, Gail, that's not fair.

294
00:14:51.576 --> 00:14:52.872
I'm laying myself bare here.

295
00:14:52.943 --> 00:14:56.880
I'm revealing my true vulnerability.
And now you're stonewalling me.

296
00:14:57.715 --> 00:14:58.704
Is that fair?

297
00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:01.519
- That's not fair.
- You stay out of this.

298
00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:04.180
Look at you angels of mercy! How do
the docs get any work done around here?

299
00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:05.587
Fine. What do you want?

300
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.117
I just want you to let me leave my samples
where he'll see them.

301
00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:11.458
'Cause otherwise, you're gonna
throw them away after I leave.

302
00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.069
Gail. No sushi, no salads.

303
00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:34.677
Who let you back here?

304
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:38.049
Oh! Dr. Knight! Do you know that
prescribing Zithromax for ear infections,

305
00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:40.183
- diarrhea and...
- Cindy! Can you deal with this, please?

306
00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:42.659
How about a pen?
Do you want a pen?

307
00:15:58.111 --> 00:16:01.104
- Okay, Prince Charming, time's up.
- Oh! Okay.

308
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:04.645
Wow! That is a long handle!

309
00:16:04.718 --> 00:16:06.310
- Would you like a pen?
- Thanks.

310
00:16:06.386 --> 00:16:07.410
Purple.

311
00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:08.853
- Bye.
- Bye.

312
00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:32.070
Uh,

313
00:16:32.146 --> 00:16:34.672
I got something for you today.

314
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:38.412
Wait, I think... Yup.
There's another one for you, too!

315
00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:45.355
The thing about these pens is that
they have tiny little point tips on them,

316
00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:47.827
and then I end up pressing too hard, and...

317
00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:49.558
Hello, gorgeous.

318
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:52.663
Jamie! Jamie, they're beautiful!

319
00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:08.176
Hey, Lisa!

320
00:17:10.986 --> 00:17:15.719
Okay, this may have worked for you
in the past, but let me lay it out.

321
00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:19.658
I became a rep for one reason, doctors.

322
00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:24.563
To meet doctors, fraternize with doctors,
breed with doctors.

323
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:29.138
So next time you see me in the field,
don't ask for a handout.

324
00:17:29.206 --> 00:17:31.036
It's just awkward.

325
00:17:34.377 --> 00:17:37.972
I want Chicago, Randall. And right now,
you're not making it happen!

326
00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:42.314
You're 20% below your quota for Z,
you're 45% below your quota for Zoloft!

327
00:17:42.553 --> 00:17:44.486
You want me off your ass, you punk?

328
00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:46.419
There's your answer.

329
00:17:47.224 --> 00:17:51.092
He's got toddlers taking Prozac.
He's got dogs taking Prozac.

330
00:17:51.161 --> 00:17:54.063
He'd have rocks taking Prozac
if they paid cash.

331
00:17:54.131 --> 00:17:56.724
And by the way, you want
one doctor to start writing Zoloft?

332
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.859
It's the guy standing next to him.

333
00:17:58.236 --> 00:17:59.703
- Knight?
- Knight.

334
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.498
Hannigan's butt buddy.

335
00:18:01.571 --> 00:18:04.769
But I swear, he starts writing it,
the rest of the docs will follow.

336
00:18:04.842 --> 00:18:06.365
And Windy City, here we come.

337
00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:12.712
- Dr. Knight.
- Hey, I'm very late.

338
00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:14.944
- One thousand dollars.
- Excuse me?

339
00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:17.853
- It's a check for $1,000.
- For what?

340
00:18:17.956 --> 00:18:19.445
For a special Pfizer preceptorship.

341
00:18:19.523 --> 00:18:22.550
For me to shadow you, learn your practice,
and better serve the needs of doctors.

342
00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:24.820
Are you bribing me?

343
00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.091
No, Doctor, no.

344
00:18:27.165 --> 00:18:31.066
It's a special Pfizer preceptorship
for me to shadow you.

345
00:18:32.704 --> 00:18:33.728
Is this a joke?

346
00:18:33.805 --> 00:18:36.637
If you think $1,000 is a joke.

347
00:18:38.844 --> 00:18:40.709
That's 33% fewer phone calls at 4:00 a. m...

348
00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:44.304
I'd write a lot more of your scrip
if I were a regularly paid consultant.

349
00:18:44.383 --> 00:18:46.283
Well, you know,
we can talk to them about that.

350
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:48.410
They spend $5 billion a year
on marketing, right?

351
00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:49.476
Mmm-hmm.

352
00:18:49.554 --> 00:18:51.750
Instead of flying me to Cancún
and making me sit through

353
00:18:51.824 --> 00:18:54.621
some bullshit, nonsense,
peer-to-peer conference,

354
00:18:54.693 --> 00:18:56.422
just give me half that money in cash.

355
00:18:56.495 --> 00:18:57.588
- Yeah, but Cancún...
- Dr. Knight,

356
00:18:57.664 --> 00:18:58.756
- Mrs. Putney's on the phone. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

357
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:01.264
Her daughter has to sing on Friday.
They're doing Bye Bye Birdie,

358
00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:04.633
and she's playing Kim, and she wondered
if you could call in an antibiotic?

359
00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:06.831
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay, thanks.

360
00:19:06.906 --> 00:19:07.964
Hey.

361
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:10.236
This can't be right. Janice? Janice?

362
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.608
A 26-year-old needs
Parkinson's medication?

363
00:19:12.679 --> 00:19:15.045
- Beth wrote that one up.
- Hi.

364
00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:19.416
All right, look, if a patient asks,
you're an intern, okay?

365
00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:21.647
Yeah. Can I take notes?

366
00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:23.382
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

367
00:19:24.657 --> 00:19:26.420
Hey. I'm Dr. Knight.

368
00:19:26.493 --> 00:19:28.324
- Maggie Murdock.
- Hi.

369
00:19:28.829 --> 00:19:33.163
- So your file says, "Kind of an emergency. "
- Yeah.

370
00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:36.702
My apartment was burgled yesterday,
and they took my Parkinson's meds.

371
00:19:37.705 --> 00:19:41.334
But my symptoms are pretty good today,
so it's "kind of an emergency. "

372
00:19:41.975 --> 00:19:45.376
I know your Lilly rep, Trey Hannigan?
He asked Cindy to squeeze me in, so...

373
00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:46.811
Yeah, Trey's a great guy.

374
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.939
Oh. Well, I wouldn't say that.

375
00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:53.678
So, monotherapy?

376
00:19:53.754 --> 00:19:56.656
Yep. Sinemet CR, 50 milligrams,
two times a day,

377
00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:59.955
plus Domperidone to cut the nausea,
10 milligrams, three times a day.

378
00:20:00.027 --> 00:20:03.794
Artane for the tremor, two milligrams,
a whole tablet, three times a day.

379
00:20:03.865 --> 00:20:05.491
And Prozac, so that I'm not too bummed

380
00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:08.331
about having
a major degenerative disorder at 26.

381
00:20:08.403 --> 00:20:10.302
Forty milligrams, once, in the morning.

382
00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:13.204
Zoloft has fewer side effects.

383
00:20:13.842 --> 00:20:15.002
I'm sorry, who are you?

384
00:20:15.643 --> 00:20:16.803
Jamie Randall.

385
00:20:17.379 --> 00:20:18.437
Oh.

386
00:20:18.646 --> 00:20:19.635
Hi.

387
00:20:20.014 --> 00:20:21.039
Intern.

388
00:20:24.085 --> 00:20:27.578
So, early-onset Parkinson's.
That's pretty rare.

389
00:20:27.656 --> 00:20:31.524
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First they thought it was
essential tremor, then Wilson's disease,

390
00:20:31.594 --> 00:20:36.861
then Huntington's.
Then, they tested for MAS, PSP, syphilis.

391
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.167
I was very glad for a negative on that one.

392
00:20:40.235 --> 00:20:43.069
I didn't really relish the thought
of feeling like a 19th century slut.

393
00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:47.966
Let's see. Then, there was
brain tumor week, which was very scary.

394
00:20:48.043 --> 00:20:50.945
And then six months
chasing obscure dystonias,

395
00:20:51.014 --> 00:20:53.607
but, no, it just turned out to be
good, old-fashioned Parkinson's.

396
00:20:53.682 --> 00:20:56.481
Right. And... Don't you have a neurologist?

397
00:20:57.787 --> 00:20:59.118
We broke up.

398
00:21:00.957 --> 00:21:03.618
And do you have insurance?

399
00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:05.786
Do I have insurance.

400
00:21:07.364 --> 00:21:08.388
Okay.

401
00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:11.529
Well, sure. Why not?

402
00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:14.331
- Great.
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

403
00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:15.392
Nope. Oh!

404
00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:16.528
Um...

405
00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:19.070
Actually, yeah.

406
00:21:19.142 --> 00:21:23.169
I have a weird blotch on my breast.

407
00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:25.477
I don't know,
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

408
00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.074
- Well, let's have a look.
- Great.

409
00:21:32.056 --> 00:21:33.181
Here you go. Do you see that?

410
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.154
- That's a spider bite.
- Is it?

411
00:21:38.229 --> 00:21:39.855
Yeah, that's a spider bite.

412
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.159
Great!

413
00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.490
All right.

414
00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:44.492
- There you are.
- Thank you, Dr. Knight.

415
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:45.593
Sure.

416
00:21:46.404 --> 00:21:48.065
You're welcome.

417
00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:56.740
- You're a drug rep?
- Wait...

418
00:21:56.814 --> 00:21:59.749
You let me take my shirt off,
you fucking creep!

419
00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.847
Wait, wait, wait. I'm hurt.

420
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.944
- Your buckle just hit my eye.
- No, it didn't.

421
00:22:04.021 --> 00:22:05.614
- I'm hurt. I'm hurt.
- Oh, my God.

422
00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.181
Who said I was a drug rep?

423
00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:08.850
Excuse me, look at your bag!

424
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.795
I don't think
you're going to the fucking airport.

425
00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:13.923
Okay, look, just apologize, okay?
Just apologize.

426
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.023
Would you do that just once?

427
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.160
I would actually like to hear someone from
the medical community actually apologize!

428
00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:20.637
Okay. Okay, I apologize.

429
00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:26.645
I apologize on behalf of all the arrogant,
faceless, cut-off, asshole doctors out there

430
00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:30.843
who've treated you like a non-person
while peeking at your breasts.

431
00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:34.477
So what's your name?

432
00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:36.979
You're good.

433
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.889
Strong eye contact. Implied intimacy.
You'll make your quotas.

434
00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:43.291
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee then.

435
00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:45.959
Whoa! What was that for?

436
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:48.163
Eat shit and die, that's what that was.

437
00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:50.930
No, wait, wait! Hold on one second!
I can do a better apology!

438
00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.275
'Cause I want to know.

439
00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:03.941
The same white tights
I wear every single day.

440
00:23:04.017 --> 00:23:06.213
You are out of your mind.

441
00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:08.083
All right, nothing underneath?

442
00:23:10.424 --> 00:23:12.517
- You're bad!
- So,

443
00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.923
I need the number of
a patient he saw yesterday.

444
00:23:16.997 --> 00:23:19.727
A Murdock, or something like that.

445
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.290
You want Maggie Murdock's number?

446
00:23:21.368 --> 00:23:25.031
Yes. Because she mentioned,
like, six neurologists,

447
00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:28.165
and Pfizer's coming out
with a new Parkinson's med,

448
00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:31.507
and I wanna contact them all,
and I wanna make a lot of money,

449
00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:32.773
Miss None Of Your Business.

450
00:23:34.014 --> 00:23:36.449
- We're not supposed to give out numbers.
- What?

451
00:23:36.518 --> 00:23:38.417
You gave me your number, you bad girl.

452
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:40.647
Do your friends know
how bad you really are?

453
00:23:41.423 --> 00:23:42.889
Jamie!

454
00:23:42.957 --> 00:23:44.425
Because if they knew
how bad you really are...

455
00:23:46.528 --> 00:23:51.158
Listen, I promise I'll wear the stethoscope
next time we play naughty nurse.

456
00:23:56.137 --> 00:23:58.002
546-2312.

457
00:23:58.073 --> 00:24:00.406
Okay, I got to go. Thanks, bye.

458
00:24:05.047 --> 00:24:07.071
What are you doing here?

459
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.983
I'm all fucked up!

460
00:24:11.621 --> 00:24:14.215
- Farrah kicked me out.
- No way.

461
00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:19.084
Can you believe that? I think she's fucking
somebody already, I swear to God!

462
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:21.095
- Why did she kick you out?
- I don't know, Jamie!

463
00:24:21.163 --> 00:24:23.791
- Jesus!
- She said I was addicted to Internet porn.

464
00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:25.629
- Are you?
- Of course I am!

465
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:27.328
Fuck! Isn't everybody?

466
00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:29.372
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

467
00:24:29.606 --> 00:24:31.573
I can't breathe.

468
00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:34.770
I'm having a panic attack.

469
00:24:35.345 --> 00:24:37.938
- Do you have any Ativan?
- We're Xanax.

470
00:24:38.014 --> 00:24:40.575
Fine, Xanax!
You have any samples of Xanax?

471
00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:44.485
Jamie, I'm in a really vulnerable place
right now.

472
00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:50.149
Okay. Okay.

473
00:24:50.627 --> 00:24:51.992
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

474
00:24:52.062 --> 00:24:53.859
Come here, come here, come here.
It's okay.

475
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.761
Dude! Dude!

476
00:24:57.334 --> 00:24:59.326
We're not huggers.

477
00:25:02.439 --> 00:25:05.000
Faster. Come on! We got this!

478
00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:08.101
- Josh, will you turn that down?
- Oh. No.

479
00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:09.777
Josh!

480
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.580
- Hello?
- Why did you take that picture?

481
00:25:18.956 --> 00:25:21.322
Is that the girl with the tits?

482
00:25:23.027 --> 00:25:24.358
How'd you get my number?

483
00:25:25.997 --> 00:25:27.430
What, you called Knight's office?

484
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.228
- How'd you get my number?
- From the receptionist.

485
00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:33.863
Who you're fucking.

486
00:25:34.073 --> 00:25:35.232
What'd she say?

487
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.834
Have coffee with me.

488
00:25:38.177 --> 00:25:40.940
- Why?
- Because I'm a drug rep.

489
00:25:41.012 --> 00:25:42.206
I'm not a creep.

490
00:25:44.483 --> 00:25:45.973
Same thing.

491
00:25:46.051 --> 00:25:50.283
Look, I'm sorry that I stared at your tits,
but they're really nice.

492
00:25:54.093 --> 00:25:55.117
Hello?

493
00:25:56.395 --> 00:25:57.555
Yes. Yes.

494
00:25:58.164 --> 00:26:00.097
Oh, I thought you hung up for a second.

495
00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:01.758
Should I have?

496
00:26:02.501 --> 00:26:04.435
What, and miss the opportunity
of insulting me?

497
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.036
Oh, you like being insulted?

498
00:26:09.676 --> 00:26:10.699
Hold on a second.

499
00:26:12.678 --> 00:26:13.668
Ow!

500
00:26:14.614 --> 00:26:15.603
Um...

501
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:17.373
By the right person.

502
00:26:17.449 --> 00:26:21.216
Oh, my God. This is a sales call, isn't it?

503
00:26:21.287 --> 00:26:24.814
You're gonna stay on the phone with me
until I say yes, aren't you?

504
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:26.756
Well, I take my work very seriously.

505
00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:31.696
5:00, Lulu's on Clark.

506
00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:33.766
All right. Bye.

507
00:26:37.905 --> 00:26:38.894
Ow!

508
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.473
Why is your answer
to everything violence?

509
00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:46.773
I said 5:00.

510
00:26:50.217 --> 00:26:52.811
- Very cute.
- Oh! Please, you can have him.

511
00:26:52.887 --> 00:26:55.219
Khaki pants? No, thanks.

512
00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:01.757
So... What's your name?

513
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:03.754
Jamie Randall.

514
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:06.664
Jamie, right. Okay, sorry.
What's your game?

515
00:27:07.536 --> 00:27:08.560
My game?

516
00:27:08.637 --> 00:27:10.501
I'm sorry, right, this is
the part where we talk about

517
00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:13.006
where we come from
and what we majored in, in college.

518
00:27:13.074 --> 00:27:14.507
You have beautiful eyes.

519
00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:17.611
That's it? That's the best you got?

520
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:18.976
I'm serious. They're beautiful.

521
00:27:19.047 --> 00:27:23.950
Well, thank you. Let's see, what else?
My childhood? When did I get sick?

522
00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:25.179
So, are you always this mean?

523
00:27:25.253 --> 00:27:27.117
Actually, this is me being nice.

524
00:27:32.093 --> 00:27:33.287
So, how's your quota this month?

525
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:34.885
Have you had
your first performance review?

526
00:27:34.963 --> 00:27:36.294
Is that a resting tremor?

527
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:38.225
Comes and goes?

528
00:27:39.768 --> 00:27:40.928
It's none of your business.

529
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.202
Happens when you're nervous.

530
00:27:43.439 --> 00:27:45.804
Mr. Expert, why would I be nervous?

531
00:27:45.874 --> 00:27:47.809
- 'Cause you're interested.
- And that would make me nervous?

532
00:27:47.877 --> 00:27:51.107
Yeah, your mind's telling you one thing,
your body's telling you something else.

533
00:27:53.649 --> 00:27:56.742
You left me standing

534
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.514
Let's go.

535
00:28:00.256 --> 00:28:01.280
Excuse me?

536
00:28:01.357 --> 00:28:03.621
You wanna close, right?
You wanna get laid?

537
00:28:03.693 --> 00:28:04.887
Now?

538
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:11.858
Mmm. Oh, right, right, right. I'm supposed
to act like I don't know if it's right,

539
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:15.893
so then you tell me that there is no right
or wrong, there's just the moment.

540
00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:21.407
And then I tell you that I can't,
while actually signaling to you that I can,

541
00:28:21.477 --> 00:28:23.537
which you don't need,
because you're not really listening,

542
00:28:23.614 --> 00:28:27.209
because this isn't about connection
for you, this isn't even about sex for you.

543
00:28:27.284 --> 00:28:31.277
This is about finding an hour or two
of relief from the pain of being you.

544
00:28:31.355 --> 00:28:32.788
And that's fine with me, see,

545
00:28:32.856 --> 00:28:36.019
because all I want is the exact same thing.

546
00:28:37.462 --> 00:28:40.624
You left me standing

547
00:28:40.697 --> 00:28:43.496
in the doorway crying

548
00:28:44.434 --> 00:28:47.598
Does that mean I don't have to leave a tip?

549
00:29:14.899 --> 00:29:18.734
And now you're thinking,
"Will I stay five minutes or ten?"

550
00:29:18.804 --> 00:29:21.272
And, "Where did I throw my pager?"

551
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.671
Mmm.

552
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:25.300
I'm not thinking that. It's under the table.

553
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.545
You're probably thinking,
"What's this guy's name again?"

554
00:29:33.152 --> 00:29:34.813
Bye, Johnny.

555
00:29:40.392 --> 00:29:42.952
I think it's time for you to go.

556
00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:45.519
Whoa, whoa, I don't need to go.

557
00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:48.066
Well, I need you to go.

558
00:29:49.335 --> 00:29:50.666
Oh, okay.

559
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:57.935
It was nice meeting you.

560
00:30:00.713 --> 00:30:03.376
It was nice meeting you, too.
Maybe we'll...

561
00:30:04.517 --> 00:30:08.510
We'll see each other around.
I'll just leave the key there.

562
00:30:09.622 --> 00:30:10.920
Thanks.

563
00:30:13.593 --> 00:30:16.256
'Cause he gets up in the morning

564
00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:18.862
And he goes to work at 9:00

565
00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:22.359
And he comes back home at 5:30

566
00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:25.336
Gets the same train every time

567
00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:29.137
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality

568
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.201
It never fails

569
00:30:31.278 --> 00:30:33.974
And he's oh, so good

570
00:30:34.348 --> 00:30:37.146
And he's oh, so fine

571
00:30:37.218 --> 00:30:39.652
And he's oh, so healthy

572
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.814
In his body and his mind

573
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.292
He's a well respected man about town

574
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:50.730
Doing the best things so conservatively

575
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.001
And his mother goes to meetings

576
00:30:57.973 --> 00:31:00.874
And she stirs the tea with councilors

577
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:01.931
While discussing foreign trade

578
00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.341
What?

579
00:31:06.782 --> 00:31:08.443
Wait! Wait.

580
00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:14.753
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

581
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:18.559
I know it's so late.

583
00:31:19.194 --> 00:31:20.184
Oh, my God!

584
00:31:20.263 --> 00:31:21.821
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

585
00:31:21.898 --> 00:31:22.990
Oh, my God!

586
00:31:23.598 --> 00:31:25.567
I didn't see anything! My glasses are off!

587
00:31:25.635 --> 00:31:26.727
Josh, turn around!

588
00:31:31.107 --> 00:31:34.099
Hi. Josh. Pleasure to meet you.

589
00:31:37.713 --> 00:31:41.114
I can recite
the six causes of pernicious anemia

590
00:31:41.184 --> 00:31:44.176
and the four stages of terminal cirrhosis.

591
00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:49.088
And by fourth grade, I knew what
a distended ileum felt like on palpation.

592
00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:52.626
So why did you bail on med school?

593
00:31:52.695 --> 00:31:54.225
I didn't bail. I just
couldn't finish college.

594
00:31:54.226 --> 00:31:55.756
I couldn't sit through a class.

595
00:31:55.966 --> 00:31:57.831
Oh. Ritalin at 10.

596
00:31:58.634 --> 00:31:59.829
Eight.

597
00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:01.935
Show-off.

598
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.471
But you were really smart?

599
00:32:05.542 --> 00:32:08.978
Yeah. The prodigal son, with ADD.

600
00:32:09.848 --> 00:32:11.212
You want to know the truth?

601
00:32:11.648 --> 00:32:12.637
Hmm?

602
00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:15.715
I just couldn't give my father
the satisfaction.

603
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:21.618
Does this generally work for you?

604
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.889
What?

605
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:31.400
This. The whole misunderstood-by-Dad-
I'm-a-vulnerable-guy thing.

606
00:32:32.604 --> 00:32:34.572
Usually. Yeah.

607
00:32:36.407 --> 00:32:38.398
Well, it's pretty good.

608
00:32:39.344 --> 00:32:40.641
Thanks.

609
00:32:40.712 --> 00:32:44.479
But somewhere along the line,
say, sixth grade,

610
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.815
a girl smiled at you,
or a bunch of girls smiled at you,

611
00:32:49.722 --> 00:32:53.179
and, ta-da,
Jamie's good at something after all.

612
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.851
Actually, it was the fifth grade.

613
00:32:58.396 --> 00:33:00.888
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

614
00:33:03.434 --> 00:33:04.663
I'm going.

615
00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:08.563
- Why?
- See...

616
00:33:11.343 --> 00:33:14.973
The thing is, I really like having sex,

617
00:33:15.048 --> 00:33:18.312
and I actually really like
having sex with you,

618
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.785
so let's just keep it simple.

619
00:33:22.855 --> 00:33:23.913
I can do that.

620
00:33:24.391 --> 00:33:26.222
Yeah, you do seem like a shithead,

621
00:33:26.293 --> 00:33:28.658
so it should be all right.

622
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.392
There's just alarms going off in my head

623
00:33:33.465 --> 00:33:36.697
that you're not entirely what you seem.

624
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.433
Oh, no, no. I'm a shithead, believe me.

625
00:33:44.412 --> 00:33:45.639
Good.

626
00:33:46.413 --> 00:33:51.043
Because if you turn out
not to be a shithead, that would be bad.

627
00:33:55.256 --> 00:33:58.452
I'm a shithead, believe me.
Through and through.

628
00:34:19.748 --> 00:34:20.736
Hey!

629
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:24.112
Hey, man. How are you?

630
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.418
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

631
00:34:29.825 --> 00:34:32.486
Damaged cells are releasing
arachidonic acid.

632
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.624
Your body's converting it to prostaglandin,

633
00:34:34.696 --> 00:34:37.256
which is triggering a fiesta
of enzymes necessary for pain.

634
00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.231
Do you wanna throw up?
It's not gonna help.

635
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:43.064
It's gonna take about a minute
for the acid to dissipate

636
00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:44.799
and your natural morphine to kick in.

637
00:34:45.807 --> 00:34:47.798
- You know why I hit you?
- No! No!

638
00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:51.941
Prozac has helped millions of people
overcome intractable mood disorders,

639
00:34:52.314 --> 00:34:53.839
making miserable lives livable.

640
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.513
It's even helped me
with some of my own anger issues.

641
00:34:56.752 --> 00:34:59.779
So when someone fucks with my Prozac,
it upsets me.

642
00:35:00.423 --> 00:35:01.514
You know what people say about me?

643
00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:04.926
You're in the top ten nationally?

644
00:35:04.994 --> 00:35:05.983
Why do you suppose that is?

645
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:08.159
Fuck you!

646
00:35:08.965 --> 00:35:10.057
Why do you suppose that is?

647
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.328
Because I'm ex-Marine,

648
00:35:12.402 --> 00:35:14.233
and I'll destroy anyone
who gets in my way.

649
00:35:14.304 --> 00:35:15.293
Right.

650
00:35:15.938 --> 00:35:16.927
Shit.

651
00:35:19.942 --> 00:35:20.931
Ow!

652
00:35:21.744 --> 00:35:22.733
Fuck.

653
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.511
I'd ice that as soon as you can.

654
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:28.813
If it hurts in a few days, get an X-ray.

655
00:35:31.688 --> 00:35:33.748
And stay away from Maggie.

656
00:35:38.529 --> 00:35:39.860
Excuse me.

657
00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:44.798
Are those more samples?

658
00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:48.362
Yeah. Help yourself.

659
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.200
Thanks.

660
00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:53.767
I got a job interview today.

661
00:35:54.045 --> 00:35:56.877
Oh, that's great. That's great.

662
00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:01.442
That's great.

663
00:36:04.289 --> 00:36:05.950
Hello, ladies!

664
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.121
No samples today.

665
00:36:10.362 --> 00:36:12.626
What do you mean?
I got great stuff for you!

666
00:36:12.831 --> 00:36:14.958
No samples today, thank you.

667
00:36:15.867 --> 00:36:16.856
She's just a friend.

668
00:36:16.935 --> 00:36:18.368
No samples today. Sorry.

669
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:20.802
Okay. What's going on?

670
00:36:21.806 --> 00:36:24.434
Trey got to you, didn't he?
What'd he give you?

671
00:36:24.709 --> 00:36:26.904
No samples today, thank you. Hawaii.

672
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:29.739
Hawaii?

673
00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:33.945
No samples today. Doctor's convention.
Sand and surf in Honolulu.

674
00:36:35.321 --> 00:36:36.981
Wow. Okay.

675
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:39.951
Okay.

676
00:36:46.565 --> 00:36:48.055
I got to get out of here.

677
00:36:48.334 --> 00:36:50.325
You're not going to go see her, are you?

678
00:36:51.003 --> 00:36:52.163
No.

679
00:36:52.873 --> 00:36:53.861
Mmm-hmm.

680
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.849
Maggie!

681
00:37:13.093 --> 00:37:14.082
Hi.

682
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:15.792
Hey, what's that?

683
00:37:16.029 --> 00:37:17.189
Food.

684
00:37:18.698 --> 00:37:20.689
- For?
- Eating.

685
00:37:21.234 --> 00:37:22.259
They're my noodles!

686
00:37:22.336 --> 00:37:23.666
You already
have a face full of noodles!

687
00:37:23.737 --> 00:37:24.726
Jesus!

688
00:37:25.038 --> 00:37:27.701
My God, you are so selfish.
You're just like my mother.

689
00:37:28.009 --> 00:37:29.839
Did you sleep with your mother?

690
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:30.968
Ew!

691
00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:32.910
- What?
- You know what?

692
00:37:33.281 --> 00:37:35.874
She's cute, she's available, you'd love her.

693
00:37:36.116 --> 00:37:38.585
The only thing is, she happens to
take up all the oxygen in the room

694
00:37:38.653 --> 00:37:40.120
and hog all the closet space,
but other than that,

695
00:37:40.188 --> 00:37:41.313
you two are perfect for each other.

696
00:37:41.388 --> 00:37:43.949
Is she hotter than you?
I bet she's hotter than you.

697
00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:45.724
She doesn't have a disease, either.

698
00:37:46.194 --> 00:37:47.718
Does that work for you generally?

699
00:37:47.795 --> 00:37:49.558
- What?
- Self-pity.

700
00:37:50.465 --> 00:37:51.956
You are a shithead.

701
00:38:02.578 --> 00:38:03.738
What?

702
00:38:04.412 --> 00:38:05.743
Nothing.

703
00:38:10.918 --> 00:38:12.250
This is nice.

704
00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.589
Okay, I think it's time to
take off your clothes and jump me.

705
00:38:21.664 --> 00:38:24.188
Wait. Am I not allowed to say that?

706
00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:25.993
I don't know.

707
00:38:26.068 --> 00:38:30.596
First you bring food,
and then you wanna spend the night,

708
00:38:30.672 --> 00:38:31.697
and then you bring a change of clothes,

709
00:38:31.774 --> 00:38:34.537
and then you bring a razor and,
oh, my God, it's a relationship.

710
00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.702
I don't want a relationship.

711
00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:37.507
Well, you can't guarantee
that now, can you?

712
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.639
You might actually have some kind of

713
00:38:39.716 --> 00:38:41.513
latent humanity that
you don't know anything about.

714
00:38:41.584 --> 00:38:44.075
You might like being
in a relationship, and...

715
00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:47.020
Listen, I said this was nice.
I didn't ask you to marry me.

716
00:38:50.693 --> 00:38:52.820
Well, I wouldn't want to be
with someone who was sick, either.

717
00:38:59.035 --> 00:39:00.366
I'm sorry.

718
00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.369
- Sorry.
- No.

719
00:39:03.439 --> 00:39:06.932
I just... I did that before,
and it didn't...

720
00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:09.536
It wasn't good.

721
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:17.052
I'd just been diagnosed,

722
00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:19.051
and he was married.

723
00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:23.220
He helped me, and it didn't end well. So...

724
00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:28.525
It's Trey Hannigan, isn't it?

725
00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:33.830
- Trey Hannigan? It was Trey Hannigan.
- Yeah, well...

726
00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.738
Uh...

727
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.601
Are you in love with him?

728
00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:44.837
No, I'm not in love with Trey Hannigan.

729
00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:47.009
I was never in love with Trey Hannigan.

730
00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:50.415
He was... Said he was in love with me.

731
00:39:54.826 --> 00:39:57.158
Which was, you know, a problem.

732
00:40:05.938 --> 00:40:07.803
- Can we just...
- Right, yeah.

733
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.338
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

734
00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.705
- Please.
- Okay.

735
00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:17.715
You get a special thank you
for bringing food.

736
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.210
I do?

737
00:40:19.552 --> 00:40:21.213
Yes, you do.

738
00:40:21.721 --> 00:40:22.710
Mmm.

739
00:40:23.556 --> 00:40:25.718
- You know what?
- What?

740
00:40:26.792 --> 00:40:27.816
What?

741
00:40:28.327 --> 00:40:29.658
I got to pee.

742
00:40:31.698 --> 00:40:33.255
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

743
00:40:55.722 --> 00:40:57.087
Just give me a second, okay?

744
00:40:57.257 --> 00:40:58.246
Okay.

745
00:41:16.244 --> 00:41:17.506
Mmm.

746
00:41:19.513 --> 00:41:21.175
Focus, focus, focus.

747
00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:26.942
Should I keep going?

748
00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:28.952
- This never happens.
- I'm aware.

749
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.781
I'm serious. It doesn't.

750
00:41:30.992 --> 00:41:34.325
No, no, no. Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm a jinx.

751
00:41:34.797 --> 00:41:36.025
That's really helpful.

752
00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:37.894
You know what? Why don't you
talk about all the other guys

753
00:41:37.965 --> 00:41:40.833
that you slept with that couldn't get it up,
'cause then it would really like...

754
00:41:40.903 --> 00:41:42.393
Shh! Shh! Shh!

755
00:41:43.638 --> 00:41:45.630
Just calm down.

756
00:41:46.975 --> 00:41:49.033
Just give me a minute.

757
00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:52.469
Don't worry about it.

758
00:41:52.548 --> 00:41:53.708
I am worried about it!

759
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:59.084
Jesus! Can you just please...
Just show me a little kindness?

760
00:42:00.256 --> 00:42:01.415
Please.

761
00:42:02.057 --> 00:42:06.687
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
You do have latent humanity.

762
00:42:07.629 --> 00:42:11.361
- Do you know what's going on here?
- I just want to have sex.

763
00:42:12.601 --> 00:42:14.433
Well, your body's telling you otherwise.

764
00:42:15.572 --> 00:42:17.506
What is that supposed to mean?

765
00:42:19.976 --> 00:42:21.273
Sit up.

766
00:42:21.344 --> 00:42:23.574
- I don't want to sit up.
- Come on. Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Come on.

767
00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:28.707
All right. Now talk to me.

768
00:42:29.185 --> 00:42:30.846
I don't want to talk.

769
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.117
What else are we going to do?
You've taken sex off the table.

770
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.317
Oh!

771
00:42:35.426 --> 00:42:38.087
Come on. Come on.
Tell me how your day was.

772
00:42:38.962 --> 00:42:40.260
- My day?
- Mmm-hmm.

773
00:42:41.198 --> 00:42:44.861
So I sneak up to my room and
I white out the "D" so it looks like a "B,"

774
00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:47.164
which I did flawlessly. It was undetectable.

775
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.062
And I go down to his study
and I hand him the paper.

776
00:42:50.141 --> 00:42:52.166
And he gives me the face.

777
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.610
And I'm like, "What?"

778
00:42:55.412 --> 00:42:56.436
Mmm-hmm.

779
00:42:56.547 --> 00:43:00.005
And then, from behind his back,
he pulls out the goddamn carbon copy

780
00:43:00.084 --> 00:43:02.075
- that the school sent home.
- Oh, no!

781
00:43:02.887 --> 00:43:04.685
- Yeah.
- Wow.

782
00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:06.416
Genius. Genius.

783
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:11.387
- You're so competitive.
- No!

784
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:14.799
Yeah! Yes, you are. Oh, my God, I tell you

785
00:43:14.866 --> 00:43:17.356
I'm involved with Trey Hannigan
and you can't get it up.

786
00:43:17.868 --> 00:43:19.302
I could give a shit about Trey Hannigan.

787
00:43:20.138 --> 00:43:22.072
All you care about is beating him!

788
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.233
- Bullshit!
- You know, it's so prehistoric.

789
00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:26.671
All men care about is performance,

790
00:43:26.745 --> 00:43:28.372
but they have an appendage
that doesn't work

791
00:43:28.446 --> 00:43:30.846
if they're worried about performance.

792
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:33.408
Mmm. Well, you're an expert, so...

793
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:40.655
Okay. If I'm an expert,
then why is your company spending

794
00:43:40.725 --> 00:43:42.852
billions making a drug
so that guys can get it up?

795
00:43:42.928 --> 00:43:43.918
Oh, I wish.

796
00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:45.926
It's true. I read it.
Pfizer's making a fuck drug.

797
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:47.995
Where'd you read that?

798
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.763
I don't know. Ask your guys.

799
00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:52.895
I don't know where I read it.
I'm a drug slut. I read everything.

800
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.705
- What drug?
- I don't know,

801
00:43:54.774 --> 00:43:56.105
but it's hard to believe, isn't it?

802
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.444
It's hard to believe.

803
00:44:00.379 --> 00:44:02.404
- It's gonna be pretty huge, though.
- Oh!

804
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:07.008
When I think of the size of the problem

805
00:44:07.286 --> 00:44:10.585
and that it's growing larger, really...

806
00:44:10.656 --> 00:44:12.521
- Really.
- I can't even imagine!

807
00:44:12.592 --> 00:44:13.821
You know what I think...

808
00:44:13.894 --> 00:44:15.259
To have found a solution
to the stiffest, hardest...

809
00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:16.317
Wow.

810
00:44:16.395 --> 00:44:19.888
- Pfizer must be swelling with pride.
- I'm gonna stop you.

811
00:44:20.067 --> 00:44:21.591
No tickling! Stop!

812
00:44:21.668 --> 00:44:23.863
Stop! No tickling! No, please!

813
00:44:23.937 --> 00:44:26.599
Don't tickle me just
because you have a limp sense of humor!

814
00:44:26.673 --> 00:44:27.662
Oh!

815
00:44:37.384 --> 00:44:38.579
Hello.

816
00:44:43.023 --> 00:44:44.491
Keep talking.

817
00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:46.150
No more talking.

818
00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:03.775
Who are all these old people?

819
00:45:04.479 --> 00:45:07.312
Uh... Just some people I work with.

820
00:45:08.817 --> 00:45:11.250
Wow. These are beautiful.

821
00:45:12.353 --> 00:45:13.787
It looks like a photograph.

822
00:45:14.156 --> 00:45:15.622
When did you do this?

823
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:17.780
Uh...

824
00:45:19.495 --> 00:45:21.792
Back when I could hold a brush.

825
00:45:22.697 --> 00:45:24.529
Here's your breakfast.

826
00:45:27.368 --> 00:45:29.132
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well...

827
00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:35.406
I'll call you.

828
00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:38.707
- Don't.
- I will.

829
00:45:39.281 --> 00:45:40.270
I'm not kidding.

830
00:45:44.487 --> 00:45:47.421
I can't do this.

831
00:45:50.527 --> 00:45:52.552
I told you.

832
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.433
Okay, then.

833
00:46:02.505 --> 00:46:04.632
See you.

834
00:46:12.082 --> 00:46:13.914
Your problem is
you don't know how to close!

835
00:46:13.985 --> 00:46:16.350
You gotta tell the docs what they need.

836
00:46:16.419 --> 00:46:17.648
Somebody says no,
that's when the fun starts.

837
00:46:17.722 --> 00:46:18.711
That means you are in.

838
00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:21.120
- My numbers are up.
- Your Zithromax is up. Big deal.

839
00:46:21.191 --> 00:46:23.183
We're not going to Chicago on Zithromax.

840
00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.524
Depressed people, Randall,
they're depressed every day.

841
00:46:25.596 --> 00:46:26.584
You gotta move Zoloft.

842
00:46:26.663 --> 00:46:29.258
- I want you to focus on Zoloft.
- Zoloft.

843
00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:32.894
Counseling? Here's some counseling.
Stop being a fucking bitch.

844
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.699
Wait, did I use "you" language?

845
00:46:34.772 --> 00:46:35.830
Trial separation.

846
00:46:35.906 --> 00:46:38.773
I'm so sorry. I need to own my feelings.

847
00:46:38.843 --> 00:46:39.867
Fucking pepperoni.

848
00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:40.933
Let me rephrase that.

849
00:46:41.012 --> 00:46:44.072
I feel that you should stop
being a fucking bitch!

850
00:46:46.217 --> 00:46:48.550
So, I hear we're coming out
with a new sex drug.

851
00:46:48.887 --> 00:46:50.945
- What are you talking about?
- Is it true?

852
00:46:51.022 --> 00:46:53.856
- Where did you hear that?
- Heard it around.

853
00:46:53.925 --> 00:46:56.916
Sildenafil citrate. It's a PDE-5 inhibitor.

854
00:46:56.995 --> 00:46:59.486
They lucked into it during trials
for blood pressure medication.

855
00:46:59.564 --> 00:47:02.692
Guys had massive boners the whole time.
Where did you hear that?

856
00:47:02.768 --> 00:47:04.360
- What's it called?
- Viagra.

857
00:47:04.436 --> 00:47:06.199
- I want it.
- Everybody wants it.

858
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:07.260
I could sell the shit out of it.

859
00:47:07.339 --> 00:47:09.864
Can you see if there's some Tums
in there for me in the glove compartment?

860
00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:11.306
- Bruce.
- Tums me, buddy.

861
00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:12.571
Bruce.

862
00:47:12.645 --> 00:47:15.078
Bruce. I want that account.

863
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.114
Why would I give it to you?

864
00:47:17.183 --> 00:47:19.878
Who can sell a dick drug better than me?

865
00:47:20.552 --> 00:47:22.987
Ten years, Jamie,
ten excruciating years of marriage.

866
00:47:23.056 --> 00:47:24.683
It's like the lost decade.

867
00:47:24.757 --> 00:47:26.656
Oh, my God!

868
00:47:26.726 --> 00:47:29.024
I don't even know
how to hit on women anymore.

869
00:47:29.095 --> 00:47:30.119
What do you do? What's your game?

870
00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:31.526
You need an IBS.
Do you know what that is?

871
00:47:31.596 --> 00:47:32.621
Irritable Bowel Syndrome?

872
00:47:32.698 --> 00:47:33.687
An Initial Benefit Statement.

873
00:47:33.766 --> 00:47:35.996
Tell them who you are, why you're there
and what you can do for them.

874
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:37.058
All right? And just be yourself, Josh.

875
00:47:37.136 --> 00:47:38.728
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you very much.

876
00:47:38.971 --> 00:47:40.939
Oh! Look who just walked in.

877
00:47:42.176 --> 00:47:43.938
Now's your chance, "Closer. "

878
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.034
Show me what you got.

879
00:47:48.182 --> 00:47:49.170
Show me.

880
00:47:49.515 --> 00:47:52.041
Hey! Pfizer, how's your fist?

881
00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:53.108
How's your jaw?

882
00:47:54.587 --> 00:47:56.282
Randall, you know Stan Knight, right?

883
00:47:56.355 --> 00:47:58.881
Stan, this is a bright young man
from Pfizer.

884
00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.153
Yes, we've met.

885
00:48:00.227 --> 00:48:01.387
- Yeah. How you doing?
- Fantastic.

886
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:04.226
New study on Zoloft,
25% fewer side effects than Prozac.

887
00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:06.129
So, I'm feeling good.

888
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.031
You'd do better selling him
if you got him laid.

889
00:48:08.102 --> 00:48:09.433
Can you get me laid?

890
00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:13.133
Stan's one of the more respected
diagnosticians in town,

891
00:48:13.207 --> 00:48:14.799
but his real calling is pussy-hound.

892
00:48:14.875 --> 00:48:16.935
Yes, and I think your real calling is pimp.

893
00:48:17.445 --> 00:48:19.605
Now, you're banging Maggie Murdock,
aren't you?

894
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.305
Are.

895
00:48:21.382 --> 00:48:22.440
You are.

896
00:48:22.517 --> 00:48:25.076
Oh, God, those tits are unbelievable!

897
00:48:25.152 --> 00:48:26.620
- So not fair!
- All right.

898
00:48:26.688 --> 00:48:30.179
No, no. You don't see that a lot
in the neurologically damned.

899
00:48:30.257 --> 00:48:32.453
What do you mean, "damned"?
You don't die from Parkinson's.

900
00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:34.324
Well, it's not much of a life, now is it?

901
00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:35.986
What do you mean? Interferon, L-dopa...

902
00:48:36.063 --> 00:48:37.622
It slowed the progress
in the majority of cases.

903
00:48:37.699 --> 00:48:38.996
Listen, Dr. Drug Rep.

904
00:48:39.067 --> 00:48:41.400
You know less than shit, okay?
She's a sick girl.

905
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.369
Oh. Is that what you told your wife?

906
00:48:43.438 --> 00:48:44.700
That's none of your fucking business.

907
00:48:44.772 --> 00:48:46.434
Maggie has all sorts of needs,

908
00:48:46.509 --> 00:48:48.373
and I don't think a pussy like you
is up for the job.

909
00:48:48.443 --> 00:48:49.501
Right, and a married man is?

910
00:48:49.577 --> 00:48:51.170
- Whoa, whoa!
- You really want me to hit you again?

911
00:48:52.081 --> 00:48:54.548
Chill out, man! Chill.
Wait! Don't get aggressive.

912
00:48:54.616 --> 00:48:56.244
Don't get aggressive. Hey!

913
00:48:56.318 --> 00:48:58.377
Whoa! Baby, okay. It's okay.

914
00:48:58.454 --> 00:48:59.943
Inter-fucking-feron, really?

915
00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:01.216
- You know what?
- Hey.

916
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:02.279
Easy, easy.

917
00:49:02.358 --> 00:49:03.985
- I'm going home.
- No, you're not.

918
00:49:04.059 --> 00:49:07.654
- No, no, no. I'm going home.
- Good. Say hi to your wife.

919
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.822
I'm keeping my eyes on you, buddy.

920
00:49:10.432 --> 00:49:12.195
That freaked me out.

921
00:49:13.602 --> 00:49:16.197
He actually, physically hit you, didn't he?

922
00:49:16.273 --> 00:49:18.433
Yeah, he did, and I was afraid
he was going to do it again.

923
00:49:18.507 --> 00:49:20.532
He might have to up his meds,
that young man.

924
00:49:20.643 --> 00:49:23.203
Or maybe he needs to change to
a drug that's proven more effective

925
00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:25.110
in controlling aggressive behavior.

926
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:30.950
Zoloft produced 13% fewer outbursts
in a controlled study of adult males.

927
00:49:31.288 --> 00:49:33.017
And I think it's...

928
00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:34.147
Turn to your left.

929
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:36.021
Turn to your left right now.
Turn to your left.

930
00:49:36.793 --> 00:49:38.226
Those two women, I know both of them.

931
00:49:38.295 --> 00:49:39.956
Which one do you want to take home?

932
00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:46.127
You're a superstar. Confidence is king.

933
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:51.032
Hey. What do you say we blow this joint,
and then each other?

934
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.335
Okay.

935
00:49:54.144 --> 00:49:55.476
Thank you.

936
00:49:58.082 --> 00:49:59.343
We ready?

937
00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:01.044
- You okay, champ?
- No.

938
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:07.380
What are you doing? Are you calling her?

939
00:50:10.328 --> 00:50:12.296
Hey, did she go down on you?

940
00:50:12.363 --> 00:50:14.854
Farrah looks at my dick
like it's the Eye of Sauron.

941
00:50:17.001 --> 00:50:17.990
Hello?

942
00:50:18.502 --> 00:50:19.833
Did you call me?

943
00:50:20.071 --> 00:50:21.835
No. I did not call you.

944
00:50:22.173 --> 00:50:23.834
I think you did.

945
00:50:24.075 --> 00:50:25.976
And what would I have said
if I had called you?

946
00:50:26.511 --> 00:50:27.909
That you want to see me?

947
00:50:28.346 --> 00:50:31.578
Well, that would be nice,
except I didn't call you.

948
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.674
Do you want to see me?

949
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.944
I'm hanging up now.

950
00:50:34.018 --> 00:50:37.352
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

951
00:50:40.058 --> 00:50:41.047
Why?

952
00:50:43.462 --> 00:50:45.987
I like hearing the sound of your voice.

953
00:50:52.437 --> 00:50:53.631
Bye, Randall.

954
00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:54.968
Maggie!

955
00:50:58.744 --> 00:51:02.476
You like hearing the sound of her voice?

956
00:51:02.548 --> 00:51:04.105
Shut up.

957
00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:07.448
Do you have a brain tumor?
Were you molested by a Care Bear?

958
00:51:07.553 --> 00:51:09.349
Were you abducted by aliens?

959
00:51:09.421 --> 00:51:10.446
You hate women.

960
00:51:10.523 --> 00:51:12.991
Why else would you
screw so many of them?

961
00:51:13.059 --> 00:51:15.289
It's time for you to overdose.

962
00:51:15.528 --> 00:51:17.155
Oh! Oh!

963
00:51:17.263 --> 00:51:19.026
Oh, she rejected you!

964
00:51:19.098 --> 00:51:20.862
That's why you want her.

965
00:51:20.934 --> 00:51:22.958
It's the first time in history
that's ever happened.

966
00:51:23.036 --> 00:51:24.264
Excuse me. Excuse me.

967
00:51:24.337 --> 00:51:26.238
I was wondering something.
Aren't you rich?

968
00:51:26.307 --> 00:51:28.433
Why are you sleeping on my couch?

969
00:51:30.744 --> 00:51:32.109
You're my big brother.

970
00:51:35.749 --> 00:51:36.738
Here.

971
00:51:37.284 --> 00:51:40.344
For people who never entered puberty.
Take six.

972
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:43.679
All right.

973
00:51:45.092 --> 00:51:47.583
- You all right?
- Can I pay by check?

974
00:51:47.661 --> 00:51:51.028
Sam, remember I told you
that the pharmacies only take cash?

975
00:51:51.098 --> 00:51:52.998
Maggie! Mag!

976
00:51:53.834 --> 00:51:55.530
Um... But, listen,
why don't you just get on the bus,

977
00:51:55.603 --> 00:51:57.069
we'll work it out there.
Okay? All right. Good.

978
00:51:57.137 --> 00:51:58.661
Maggie, I want to talk to you.

979
00:51:58.739 --> 00:52:00.605
I can't talk right now, all right?

980
00:52:00.675 --> 00:52:02.539
- I'm getting on a bus to Canada.
- Canada?

981
00:52:02.609 --> 00:52:03.769
Yes. Yes, Canada.

982
00:52:03.844 --> 00:52:05.813
These people can't afford
to pay for their prescriptions here.

983
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.711
Maggie, will we have bathroom breaks?

984
00:52:07.782 --> 00:52:10.114
Sophie, remember I told you
that there's a bathroom on the bus?

985
00:52:10.185 --> 00:52:12.119
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

986
00:52:12.187 --> 00:52:14.451
- Okay. When do you get back?
- Never.

987
00:52:15.323 --> 00:52:17.655
- Tomorrow night, late.
- How late?

988
00:52:17.726 --> 00:52:21.685
Just forget about it, okay? Please?
I'm begging you.

989
00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:30.197
Why don't you take a pen?

990
00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:32.205
I'll send you a pamphlet
and an efficacy statement, okay?

991
00:52:32.273 --> 00:52:34.265
What time is it, do you know?

992
00:52:34.377 --> 00:52:37.278
Wow. Okay, I got to go.
I'll give you a call, okay?

993
00:52:38.913 --> 00:52:43.351
We've come a long, long way together

994
00:52:43.419 --> 00:52:46.946
Through the hard times and the good

995
00:52:47.656 --> 00:52:51.854
I have to celebrate you, baby

996
00:52:51.927 --> 00:52:56.694
I have to praise you like I should

997
00:52:59.936 --> 00:53:01.164
...know.

998
00:53:01.238 --> 00:53:04.264
Know how to handle large sums of money

999
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:06.275
with harmony and with love,

1000
00:53:06.343 --> 00:53:09.676
and that the truth is
that you have high ideals,

1001
00:53:09.746 --> 00:53:13.181
and that you are a person
of great personal integrity,

1002
00:53:13.249 --> 00:53:17.550
and you will keep your mind focused
upon financial prosperity.

1003
00:53:32.135 --> 00:53:35.071
Looks like you got
all your stuff, right? Okay. Good.

1004
00:53:35.139 --> 00:53:37.800
- You guys travel home safe.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1005
00:53:37.874 --> 00:53:39.365
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1006
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:42.042
- Bye, Maggie!
- Bye.

1007
00:54:03.735 --> 00:54:04.963
Hi.

1008
00:54:06.904 --> 00:54:09.396
When you end it, I get to hate you,

1009
00:54:09.475 --> 00:54:12.602
and act all cold,
and tell embarrassing stuff to my friends.

1010
00:54:12.877 --> 00:54:13.867
Okay.

1011
00:54:13.946 --> 00:54:15.675
And you don't get to move in,

1012
00:54:15.747 --> 00:54:18.807
or become friends with my friends,
or introduce me to your parents.

1013
00:54:18.884 --> 00:54:20.818
This is what this is, whatever this is.

1014
00:54:20.886 --> 00:54:21.910
Are you done?

1015
00:54:22.421 --> 00:54:23.719
Have you been here all night?

1016
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.154
Yes.

1017
00:54:30.095 --> 00:54:31.756
Oh, Christ!

1018
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:38.129
Why am I mad at you already?

1019
00:55:17.176 --> 00:55:20.408
Oh, Jamie. It's Brucie.
You want to meet me?

1020
00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:23.814
I've got a load of love in my trunk for you.
Something you're going to like.

1021
00:55:23.884 --> 00:55:25.283
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1022
00:55:25.352 --> 00:55:27.719
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Call me, call me, call me.

1023
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:29.016
You're gonna love me, love me...

1024
00:55:31.926 --> 00:55:32.916
Ah!

1025
00:55:33.495 --> 00:55:35.758
Jamie, it's Bruce. Where are you?

1026
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:37.228
Who are you?

1027
00:55:40.602 --> 00:55:43.366
Let the games begin!

1028
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.536
Make it hot! Make it hot!

1029
00:55:51.613 --> 00:55:53.774
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth?

1030
00:55:53.848 --> 00:55:56.578
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1031
00:55:56.651 --> 00:55:59.176
Men with diabetes,
men with prostate cancer,

1032
00:55:59.254 --> 00:56:01.154
men with massive penile injuries.

1033
00:56:01.222 --> 00:56:05.090
Men with performance anxiety,
men with any common form of impotence

1034
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.752
or sexual dysfunction.

1035
00:56:06.828 --> 00:56:09.525
Men without a useful erection in years!

1036
00:56:09.732 --> 00:56:11.426
Boing!

1037
00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:14.936
Minimum side effects, long-term safety.
This isn't a pill.

1038
00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:17.939
This is a revolution. Questions?

1039
00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.406
Yeah. Where are the samples?

1040
00:56:19.475 --> 00:56:21.409
Right here, baby. Right here.

1041
00:56:21.477 --> 00:56:24.275
You sure you want one? You want two?
Who wants two?

1042
00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:28.010
Did you see this? Bob Dole says
his TV commercials for Viagra

1043
00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.882
won't hurt his wife's campaign
for President.

1044
00:56:30.953 --> 00:56:32.683
He also says the Viagra commercials

1045
00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:36.282
won't hurt his campaign
to nail Heather Locklear.

1046
00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:38.760
The dick drug! That's my brother's!

1047
00:56:39.096 --> 00:56:41.957
Oh, my God!

1048
00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:47.163
Viagra, the little pill that has started
a gold rush for its manufacturer,

1049
00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.898
the drug giant Pfizer.

1050
00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:53.036
Jamie! Jamie! Hey!

1051
00:56:53.377 --> 00:56:55.538
- Ted Goldstein, ENT.
- Oh, Ted, hi. How are you?

1052
00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:58.479
I'm good. Look, I got this friend,
he's a radiologist.

1053
00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:00.675
He has a little problem. I thought maybe...

1054
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:02.151
Say no more.

1055
00:57:03.154 --> 00:57:04.211
You're a gem.

1056
00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:07.052
Viagra is the first-ever pill
to treat impotence.

1057
00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:10.287
It's easy, it's effective,
and it's now wildly in demand.

1058
00:57:13.398 --> 00:57:15.331
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

1059
00:57:15.399 --> 00:57:17.197
Oncologists are writing it,
shrinks are writing it,

1060
00:57:17.268 --> 00:57:19.065
gastroenterologists are writing it.

1061
00:57:19.137 --> 00:57:21.229
Pediatricians are writing it for themselves!

1062
00:57:21.739 --> 00:57:23.502
I mean, pharmacies could
stay open 24 hours

1063
00:57:23.574 --> 00:57:24.734
and they still couldn't meet the demand.

1064
00:57:24.809 --> 00:57:26.573
We're running 1,200 prescriptions a month.

1065
00:57:26.645 --> 00:57:29.579
That's more than my entire year's quota!
And you don't care.

1066
00:57:29.647 --> 00:57:33.083
About a bunch of old guys
with stiffies? Nope.

1067
00:57:33.151 --> 00:57:34.743
How can you be so callous?

1068
00:57:34.819 --> 00:57:38.085
Men are suffering worldwide
from shame and...

1069
00:57:43.595 --> 00:57:45.653
And frustration.

1070
00:57:50.935 --> 00:57:53.564
Oh, you're my little blue pill.

1071
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.571
Oh, for God's sake.

1072
00:57:56.642 --> 00:57:58.769
No. What about this do you think is okay?

1073
00:57:58.844 --> 00:58:01.905
What are you...
I don't want to see this! No.

1074
00:58:01.981 --> 00:58:03.311
What the fuck are you doing?

1075
00:58:03.382 --> 00:58:06.113
- No, no, no! This is too much information.
- I just need this.

1076
00:58:06.186 --> 00:58:08.449
Are you fucking filming it?

1077
00:58:09.021 --> 00:58:10.511
Do you do, like, close-ups and shit?

1078
00:58:13.293 --> 00:58:14.782
Who holds it?

1079
00:58:26.372 --> 00:58:27.361
Hey.

1080
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.539
Wake up.

1081
00:58:31.612 --> 00:58:33.010
Oh!

1082
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.069
Again?

1083
00:58:40.353 --> 00:58:41.343
Maggie!

1084
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:46.753
Come on. I'm an artist. This is work.

1085
00:58:48.162 --> 00:58:49.594
Oh, my God.

1086
00:58:49.662 --> 00:58:51.153
Say something.

1087
00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:55.062
You're just too weird.

1088
00:58:55.136 --> 00:58:56.296
Yeah, well...

1089
00:58:59.173 --> 00:59:02.301
Hi, there. Jamie Randall here.

1090
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:08.073
Just reporting from bed,
having just fucked my girlfriend.

1091
00:59:08.649 --> 00:59:10.446
- And...
- Don't use that word.

1092
00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:12.783
What? You use "fuck" all the time.

1093
00:59:12.854 --> 00:59:15.048
No, not "fucking. " "Girlfriend. "

1094
00:59:16.358 --> 00:59:17.689
That's what you are.

1095
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:23.188
I am?

1096
00:59:24.232 --> 00:59:25.824
Yeah, you are.

1097
00:59:28.203 --> 00:59:30.000
I guess I am.

1098
00:59:33.875 --> 00:59:35.537
Jesus.

1099
00:59:52.195 --> 00:59:55.858
I lived in a place called Okfuskee

1100
00:59:57.099 --> 01:00:00.728
And I had a little girl in a holler tree

1101
01:00:02.405 --> 01:00:06.273
I said, "Little girl it's plain to see

1102
01:00:07.643 --> 01:00:10.511
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me

1103
01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:13.777
"Ain't nobody that can sing like me "

1104
01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:21.951
She said it's hard for me to see

1105
01:00:22.993 --> 01:00:26.588
How one little boy got so ugly

1106
01:00:28.398 --> 01:00:31.765
Yes, my little girly that might be

1107
01:00:32.903 --> 01:00:36.168
But there ain't nobody
that can sing like me

1108
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.107
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

1109
01:00:41.079 --> 01:00:42.511
Way over yonder in the minor key

1110
01:00:45.817 --> 01:00:48.284
Way over yonder in the minor key

1111
01:00:48.352 --> 01:00:49.410
No, Mom.

1112
01:00:49.486 --> 01:00:53.582
No, it's not an aphrodisiac.
It's a vasodilator.

1113
01:00:53.657 --> 01:00:56.286
A vasodilator. No, Ma...

1114
01:00:57.729 --> 01:00:59.890
No, just... No, I...

1115
01:01:00.632 --> 01:01:03.260
Yeah, I've already sold
2,000 prescriptions this month alone.

1116
01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:04.858
It's a lot of money.

1117
01:01:06.804 --> 01:01:10.332
Okay, I really can't talk.
Maggie needs me.

1118
01:01:10.409 --> 01:01:11.568
Okay, bye.

1119
01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:16.314
I thought you said
it was 1,200 prescriptions.

1120
01:01:17.682 --> 01:01:18.671
It is.

1121
01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:23.345
Well, why did you tell her 2,000?

1122
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:25.279
Did I?

1123
01:01:27.993 --> 01:01:29.050
Are you kidding?

1124
01:01:30.229 --> 01:01:31.821
I don't know, it just sounded better.

1125
01:01:34.501 --> 01:01:36.661
You told your mother a lie
because it sounds better?

1126
01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:40.604
Look, she doesn't know numbers.

1127
01:01:40.673 --> 01:01:43.005
Do you tell me lies
because they sound better?

1128
01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:44.301
No!

1129
01:01:44.377 --> 01:01:45.366
Well, why did you do it with her?

1130
01:01:45.445 --> 01:01:47.469
Because she wants to
know that I'm doing well...

1131
01:01:47.546 --> 01:01:49.104
Okay, but you are doing well,

1132
01:01:49.182 --> 01:01:51.173
so why do you need
to make it sound better?

1133
01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:53.445
Okay, you know what?

1134
01:01:53.519 --> 01:01:56.318
I will call her back up right now,
and I will correct my mistake.

1135
01:01:56.389 --> 01:01:57.515
Okay?

1136
01:02:01.027 --> 01:02:02.927
Tell me four good things about yourself.

1137
01:02:05.198 --> 01:02:06.392
Excuse me?

1138
01:02:07.233 --> 01:02:08.222
You heard me.

1139
01:02:09.837 --> 01:02:11.235
Okay.

1140
01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:15.037
Four good things about myself.

1141
01:02:15.876 --> 01:02:17.536
I can...

1142
01:02:20.114 --> 01:02:21.342
Why are we doing this?

1143
01:02:21.415 --> 01:02:22.938
This is just... I don't...

1144
01:02:23.016 --> 01:02:25.451
You can't even think
of four good things about yourself.

1145
01:02:25.519 --> 01:02:26.543
What? I totally can!

1146
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.052
Do you think that you're generous?

1147
01:02:30.491 --> 01:02:31.549
Do you think you're sweet?

1148
01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:35.889
Not particularly.

1149
01:02:35.963 --> 01:02:37.260
Do you think that you're smart?

1150
01:02:38.399 --> 01:02:40.230
Oh, my God!

1151
01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:43.727
Look at you.

1152
01:02:47.074 --> 01:02:48.405
You're this

1153
01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:50.734
talented,

1154
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.847
charming, handsome, capable,
determined, smart man.

1155
01:03:03.258 --> 01:03:04.589
I am?

1156
01:03:06.762 --> 01:03:08.229
Yes, you are.

1157
01:03:17.439 --> 01:03:18.429
I can juggle.

1158
01:03:23.111 --> 01:03:25.444
- Does it make it longer?
- Time or inches?

1159
01:03:25.515 --> 01:03:27.880
- How come we can't take it?
- You can.

1160
01:03:27.949 --> 01:03:29.884
Are you saying
that we can get hard?

1161
01:03:29.952 --> 01:03:32.443
There is some indication
of increased lubrication.

1162
01:03:34.357 --> 01:03:37.087
- If they come inside you, does it burn?
- No.

1163
01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.151
How about in your mouth?

1164
01:03:39.962 --> 01:03:42.123
Jamie, we want more Viagra!

1165
01:03:42.198 --> 01:03:44.064
- More! More Viagra!
- More Viagra!

1166
01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:48.604
Stan! Come here. Come over here!

1167
01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:52.573
Ladies, this is Dr. Stan Knight,
king of all internists.

1168
01:03:52.642 --> 01:03:54.406
Right? And this is...

1169
01:03:54.478 --> 01:03:56.070
Cassie.

1170
01:03:56.146 --> 01:03:58.307
But my friends call me Lisa.

1171
01:03:59.249 --> 01:04:01.479
Lisa wants to marry a doctor, so good luck.

1172
01:04:01.552 --> 01:04:02.882
Oh, dear.

1173
01:04:02.953 --> 01:04:05.046
Ladies, next round is on me! Okay?

1174
01:04:07.491 --> 01:04:09.118
Nice jacket, man.

1175
01:04:36.187 --> 01:04:37.814
Did you get laid?

1176
01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:39.349
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1177
01:04:39.824 --> 01:04:41.485
- Six times.
- Mmm.

1178
01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:44.019
I was scared that you were.

1179
01:04:45.763 --> 01:04:47.230
You're crazy.

1180
01:05:02.882 --> 01:05:03.871
What?

1181
01:05:04.884 --> 01:05:05.942
Is everything okay?

1182
01:05:06.552 --> 01:05:08.713
Jamie... Honey?

1183
01:05:09.221 --> 01:05:11.621
- Honey, your heart's beating really fast.
- I know.

1184
01:05:11.891 --> 01:05:13.052
What's...

1185
01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:16.260
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

1186
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:19.260
Jamie. It's okay. It's okay.

1187
01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:20.355
Talk to me.

1188
01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:22.222
I...

1189
01:05:22.903 --> 01:05:23.892
I...

1190
01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:26.866
Okay, you know what? Just breathe.
Don't even worry about it.

1191
01:05:26.939 --> 01:05:28.339
Just breathe.

1192
01:05:28.742 --> 01:05:30.403
It's okay.

1193
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:32.869
I...

1194
01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:37.546
- I love you.
- What?

1195
01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:41.752
Just give me a second, okay?

1196
01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:43.920
Oh, God, I do.

1197
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:46.614
Uh...

1198
01:05:47.094 --> 01:05:48.754
- No, you don't.
- Don't touch me!

1199
01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:50.159
Okay.
Do you want a glass of water?

1200
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:51.219
I'm sorry.

1201
01:05:51.298 --> 01:05:53.290
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

1202
01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:55.061
- A little water?
- Yeah, water.

1203
01:05:56.903 --> 01:05:57.893
Oh, yeah.

1204
01:05:58.906 --> 01:06:01.567
Okay, see? Here you go. Here you go.

1205
01:06:02.677 --> 01:06:03.735
Okay.

1206
01:06:09.817 --> 01:06:12.013
- I love you. I can't stop saying it.
- You don't...

1207
01:06:12.087 --> 01:06:15.351
- Just stop saying that, okay?
- I can't. I love you.

1208
01:06:16.424 --> 01:06:17.414
You don't understand.

1209
01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:20.356
I've never said that to anyone before.

1210
01:06:22.164 --> 01:06:24.688
- You've never said "I love you"?
- No.

1211
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.432
You never said it to your parents?

1212
01:06:31.005 --> 01:06:32.030
No.

1213
01:06:32.107 --> 01:06:33.870
- You never said it to your brother?
- Ugh!

1214
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:36.008
Jesus, you're more fucked up than I am.

1215
01:06:37.846 --> 01:06:39.814
I once said it to a cat.

1216
01:06:42.117 --> 01:06:44.608
- Okay, that makes me feel better.
- It does? Okay, good.

1217
01:06:44.686 --> 01:06:46.449
You can hold me now.

1218
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.047
Okay.

1219
01:06:56.131 --> 01:06:57.121
Oh!

1220
01:06:59.302 --> 01:07:00.495
Joshie!

1221
01:07:05.974 --> 01:07:07.966
That is disgusting.

1222
01:07:08.144 --> 01:07:11.409
Jamie, I didn't know
you were coming home!

1223
01:07:12.515 --> 01:07:13.846
Oh!

1224
01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.918
Hey.

1225
01:07:17.987 --> 01:07:21.184
Listen, it's not what it looks like, okay?

1226
01:07:21.258 --> 01:07:22.782
Well, it kind of is, but...

1227
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.156
Okay, just chill.

1228
01:07:24.227 --> 01:07:25.626
Yeah, chill. Oh, I'm sorry,

1229
01:07:25.695 --> 01:07:28.392
I thought I just caught my brother
masturbating while watching me have sex.

1230
01:07:28.898 --> 01:07:30.991
Well, I was focusing on her.

1231
01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:32.395
Oh, "her. "

1232
01:07:32.503 --> 01:07:34.494
- You mean my girlfriend! I'm sorry.
- No.

1233
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:36.334
Not on her!

1234
01:07:36.407 --> 01:07:39.706
On her body parts!
Does video make everything look bigger?

1235
01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:42.211
Because I didn't think
her tits were that big.

1236
01:07:42.279 --> 01:07:43.769
Then I saw you,

1237
01:07:43.847 --> 01:07:46.442
and I was like, "What,
did an anaconda get loose on the bed?"

1238
01:07:46.518 --> 01:07:47.541
This is so twisted.

1239
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:50.552
Do you think Dad's big?
I mean, he was when we were kids,

1240
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:54.352
but then everything's bigger
when you're a kid, right?

1241
01:07:55.693 --> 01:07:57.855
Fine! Okay? Sorry!

1242
01:07:58.196 --> 01:07:59.287
My self-esteem would prefer

1243
01:07:59.363 --> 01:08:02.765
that you not have a bigger penis
than me right now, that's all!

1244
01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:04.300
Shh! Shh!

1245
01:08:06.538 --> 01:08:08.005
Don't be mad.

1246
01:08:11.776 --> 01:08:14.040
Run, Josh. Run, Josh.

1247
01:08:14.112 --> 01:08:15.511
Run, Joshie.

1248
01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:19.277
We can talk about this like men!
Ow! You're gonna ruin the tape!

1249
01:08:20.118 --> 01:08:23.485
No normal human being
can possibly fit in this back seat.

1250
01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:25.147
That definition excludes you, Josh.

1251
01:08:25.223 --> 01:08:28.215
I'd literally be more comfortable
in the back of a Hot Wheels right now.

1252
01:08:28.493 --> 01:08:30.860
I've lost all feeling in my legs.

1253
01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:35.155
- Are you okay?
- No!

1254
01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:37.395
I'm not talking to you, Josh.

1255
01:08:38.137 --> 01:08:39.570
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1256
01:08:39.638 --> 01:08:40.798
Okay.

1257
01:10:16.972 --> 01:10:18.098
He's waiting for you.

1258
01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:21.006
- So, how are you doing?
- Fine. How's Maggie?

1259
01:10:25.181 --> 01:10:26.408
Come in!

1260
01:10:27.449 --> 01:10:28.973
- Whoa!
- No, come in, come in.

1261
01:10:33.388 --> 01:10:34.549
Testosterone, man.

1262
01:10:34.858 --> 01:10:38.486
Chicago's in two days. I must prepare.

1263
01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:41.890
It's a fucking orgy
masquerading as a medical convention.

1264
01:10:41.965 --> 01:10:44.159
- You're coming, aren't you?
- I don't know.

1265
01:10:44.734 --> 01:10:47.396
- Oh, right. How's she doing?
- She's great.

1266
01:10:47.704 --> 01:10:49.535
Well, I'm not. I need a break.

1267
01:10:49.939 --> 01:10:51.873
HMOs are killing me. Killing me!

1268
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:55.604
I need a lot of loosely moraled women
to throw themselves at me. Hard.

1269
01:10:55.879 --> 01:10:57.676
Speaking of which...

1270
01:10:58.715 --> 01:11:01.082
Oh, you are a god! You're a god, sir!

1271
01:11:01.151 --> 01:11:02.378
You're really not coming to this?

1272
01:11:02.452 --> 01:11:03.783
You could do something for me.

1273
01:11:04.187 --> 01:11:05.177
Yeah, what's that?

1274
01:11:05.456 --> 01:11:07.719
You could start prescribing Zoloft
instead of Prozac.

1275
01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:10.085
Um...

1276
01:11:11.462 --> 01:11:13.452
Well, Trey's a friend of mine, man.

1277
01:11:14.899 --> 01:11:16.389
I know. I know.

1278
01:11:18.536 --> 01:11:23.132
- Sure. Zoloft. Okay. Why not?
- Great.

1279
01:11:27.111 --> 01:11:28.942
- Hey!
- Hey.

1280
01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:32.812
How was your day?

1281
01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.415
Amazing.

1282
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:36.808
Mmm?

1283
01:11:38.255 --> 01:11:39.587
You?

1284
01:11:39.658 --> 01:11:41.853
Me? My day was...

1285
01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.587
My day was swell.

1286
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:47.922
- I went to the clinic...
- You did?

1287
01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:49.933
...for a scrip

1288
01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:55.797
and waited for three hours sitting next
to a man with a fork stuck in his head.

1289
01:11:56.308 --> 01:11:57.502
- What?
- Yep.

1290
01:11:57.576 --> 01:12:02.946
And then I went
to the pharmacy to get the scrip filled.

1291
01:12:04.617 --> 01:12:07.278
Which was closed,

1292
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.851
so no meds for Maggie.

1293
01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:19.955
Are you okay?

1294
01:12:22.868 --> 01:12:24.426
Why, do I look like shit?

1295
01:12:24.503 --> 01:12:25.800
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah.

1296
01:12:25.871 --> 01:12:29.000
You didn't say. You didn't say it out loud.

1297
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:38.882
Thanks, I'd love one.

1298
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:43.653
Sorry.

1299
01:12:48.227 --> 01:12:50.594
You think maybe you've had enough?

1300
01:12:50.664 --> 01:12:53.327
Nope, I don't, but you do.

1301
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:54.990
Excuse me?

1302
01:12:55.569 --> 01:12:58.505
Tell me, Randall, what exactly is it
about me that's so desirable?

1303
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.334
There's going to be 600 girls
dying to blow you at this convention.

1304
01:13:02.576 --> 01:13:04.738
- Well, I'm not going to the convention.
- Why not?

1305
01:13:04.879 --> 01:13:11.045
Go out with some sexy, limber
ex-cheerleader from Alabama,

1306
01:13:11.418 --> 01:13:14.911
who's just dying to discuss
market projections and sales techniques.

1307
01:13:15.356 --> 01:13:19.349
Or just a hot HMO administrator
who likes to bake cookies

1308
01:13:19.427 --> 01:13:22.919
and rub your head
while you discuss the evils of generics.

1309
01:13:23.197 --> 01:13:25.290
Or just, you know, I don't know,
a normal person,

1310
01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:28.768
who has energy and likes to do things
and have fun!

1311
01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:29.825
I happen to want you.

1312
01:13:29.904 --> 01:13:33.636
Why? Why? What are you trying to prove?

1313
01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:36.474
Are you trying to show
that you're not a flake?

1314
01:13:36.544 --> 01:13:40.708
Are you trying to stick with something
for once in your goddamn life?

1315
01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:43.217
I mean, you do realize
that you are not a good person

1316
01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.276
because you pity-fuck the sick girl, right?

1317
01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:01.360
I almost went home with
someone from the clinic today.

1318
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.731
All right.

1319
01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:06.067
- There, you see?
- All right.

1320
01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:09.074
Don't forget your pager.

1321
01:14:47.451 --> 01:14:49.180
Come with me to Chicago.

1322
01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:58.322
- Keith! How you doing, man?
- Jamie. Good.

1323
01:14:58.395 --> 01:15:00.556
So good to see you.
Everything going well?

1324
01:15:00.798 --> 01:15:04.131
I'm going to go off and do some girly thing,
whatever that is.

1325
01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:06.800
- How will I reach you?
- I'll beep you.

1326
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.629
Stage One?

1327
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:12.802
I'm sorry?

1328
01:15:12.878 --> 01:15:14.311
My son's a Stage Three.

1329
01:15:14.813 --> 01:15:16.541
It's not obvious, don't worry.

1330
01:15:17.883 --> 01:15:19.214
We're across the street.

1331
01:15:20.519 --> 01:15:24.182
Whenever you get tired of this bullshit
and want to hear what's really going on...

1332
01:15:24.823 --> 01:15:26.484
Thank you.

1333
01:15:36.334 --> 01:15:37.666
Fuck soup.

1334
01:15:37.904 --> 01:15:39.734
Fuck shoelaces.

1335
01:15:40.005 --> 01:15:42.736
Fuck jewelry. And fuck brushing teeth.

1336
01:15:44.676 --> 01:15:47.840
- Fuck...
- Trying to tie your tie. Fuck...

1337
01:15:47.914 --> 01:15:49.108
Trying to button down a shirt.

1338
01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:51.513
And fuck that meditation shit.

1339
01:15:53.352 --> 01:15:57.812
And who knew God wanted us
to be so good

1340
01:15:57.924 --> 01:16:00.154
at giving hand jobs?

1341
01:16:03.196 --> 01:16:06.529
My husband is always smiling.

1342
01:16:17.044 --> 01:16:19.035
Parkinson's has made me

1343
01:16:20.446 --> 01:16:22.278
more sensitive and more compassionate.

1344
01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:27.282
Hopefully, got a long way to go in all this.
I feel good, and...

1345
01:16:27.454 --> 01:16:31.322
So, it's a constant battle of
trying to maintain some dignity

1346
01:16:31.392 --> 01:16:32.722
and grace in society.

1347
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.123
And to overcome that,
you just live with what you have.

1348
01:16:46.574 --> 01:16:50.236
Offering to hold the kid for just a minute,
and he ends up in that tree over there.

1349
01:16:51.144 --> 01:16:55.138
One of my girlfriends asked me once
if she could get me anything.

1350
01:16:55.415 --> 01:16:59.079
I said, "How about a new brain?
Nothing fancy. "

1351
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.413
She said, "My husband's not using his. "

1352
01:17:03.258 --> 01:17:04.748
Wait. Wait.

1353
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.254
Never mind. Sorry.
I thought I heard a cure coming.

1354
01:17:14.502 --> 01:17:16.494
But there are good things.

1355
01:17:16.772 --> 01:17:21.436
You have to understand
that you're still yourself.

1356
01:17:21.777 --> 01:17:25.439
You're still there. And life goes on.

1357
01:17:26.115 --> 01:17:29.107
And life is beautiful. Thank you.

1358
01:17:37.126 --> 01:17:38.787
Parkinson's, right?

1359
01:17:39.628 --> 01:17:40.789
Oh, no. No.

1360
01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:42.195
No, your wife.

1361
01:17:42.631 --> 01:17:44.462
Girlfriend.

1362
01:17:46.469 --> 01:17:47.629
Stage One.

1363
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:49.633
Good days and bad days, huh?

1364
01:17:50.139 --> 01:17:51.630
Mostly good days.

1365
01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:53.531
You?

1366
01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:55.540
Wife. Since '73.

1367
01:17:56.313 --> 01:17:57.644
Stage Four.

1368
01:17:58.381 --> 01:17:59.973
You got any advice?

1369
01:18:00.216 --> 01:18:02.810
- You don't need my advice.
- Come on. I'm very trainable.

1370
01:18:05.322 --> 01:18:08.519
My advice is to go upstairs,
pack your bags, and leave a nice note.

1371
01:18:08.591 --> 01:18:10.320
Find yourself a healthy woman.

1372
01:18:12.662 --> 01:18:16.827
I love my wife. I do.
But I wouldn't do it over again.

1373
01:18:18.835 --> 01:18:20.667
The thing nobody tells you,

1374
01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:23.764
this disease will steal
everything you love in her.

1375
01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:25.399
Her body, her smile, her mind.

1376
01:18:27.011 --> 01:18:29.343
Sooner or later, she'll lose motor control.

1377
01:18:30.348 --> 01:18:33.181
Eventually, she won't even
be able to dress herself.

1378
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.583
Then, the fun really begins.
Cleaning up her shit.

1379
01:18:37.021 --> 01:18:39.353
Frozen face. Dementia.

1380
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.259
It's not a disease, it's a Russian novel.

1381
01:18:47.265 --> 01:18:49.755
Look, I'm sorry. I'm out of line.

1382
01:18:51.203 --> 01:18:52.534
Hang in there.

1383
01:18:56.475 --> 01:18:59.466
Did you realize there are
other people with Parkinson's?

1384
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:01.642
How remarkable!

1385
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.642
Amazing people. People doing things.

1386
01:19:04.883 --> 01:19:09.081
Like this one woman runs marathons,
and another one scuba dives.

1387
01:19:09.154 --> 01:19:11.987
And they're pissed off
and they're tired of being marginalized.

1388
01:19:12.057 --> 01:19:13.718
Oh, my God, they are so cool!

1389
01:19:14.893 --> 01:19:17.191
I feel good. I feel really good.

1390
01:19:17.262 --> 01:19:18.627
I feel better than I
have felt in a long time,

1391
01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:19.993
and you brought me here.

1392
01:19:20.066 --> 01:19:23.398
I mean, okay, whatever,
it was the wrong convention, sure, but...

1393
01:19:24.336 --> 01:19:26.669
Jamie, I... Jamie.

1394
01:19:29.775 --> 01:19:31.937
- I have been such a bitch to you.
- Oh, no.

1395
01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:35.071
And you didn't even run away.
How is that possible?

1396
01:19:35.348 --> 01:19:37.339
It's like, this is...

1397
01:19:38.184 --> 01:19:40.085
Like, the first time in my life that I've

1398
01:19:42.522 --> 01:19:44.753
ever not felt alone.

1399
01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:48.686
That someone is there for me.
Do you know what that means?

1400
01:19:49.028 --> 01:19:50.860
Oh, my God.

1401
01:19:54.768 --> 01:19:55.962
I love you.

1402
01:19:58.105 --> 01:19:59.093
I do.

1403
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:04.033
I love you. I love you, I love you.

1404
01:20:04.377 --> 01:20:06.209
I really love you.

1405
01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.075
- Hey.
- Hey.

1406
01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:38.806
What are you doing?

1407
01:20:39.747 --> 01:20:40.907
Nothing.

1408
01:20:41.416 --> 01:20:42.906
I fell asleep.

1409
01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:50.387
A cure for Parkinson's?

1410
01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:52.254
That's what I'm asking.

1411
01:20:52.494 --> 01:20:53.586
Pfizer, I'm a GP.

1412
01:20:53.828 --> 01:20:57.764
Twenty universities, 15 teaching hospitals,
every major drug company,

1413
01:20:57.832 --> 01:20:59.664
and the goddamn NIH
are all working on this.

1414
01:20:59.935 --> 01:21:01.630
And I'm sure the second they find it,

1415
01:21:01.704 --> 01:21:03.432
you're gonna be
the first in line to sell it to me.

1416
01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:06.000
Well, in the meantime, she gets worse.

1417
01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:09.540
What is this, General Hospital?
What do you want me to do?

1418
01:21:09.612 --> 01:21:11.011
I want you to feel bad about it, Stan.

1419
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.714
If I felt bad about every patient
that I couldn't help,

1420
01:21:13.782 --> 01:21:14.943
then I don't make it through the day.

1421
01:21:15.018 --> 01:21:16.678
What are the cutting edge treatments?

1422
01:21:16.952 --> 01:21:19.148
I don't know.
You want me to get you a list?

1423
01:21:19.222 --> 01:21:20.621
Great. Tomorrow.

1424
01:21:23.626 --> 01:21:25.458
Pfizer, you're a nice kid.

1425
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:28.962
You're starting to do well.
You sure you want to do this?

1426
01:21:29.132 --> 01:21:31.657
And a list of doctors,
and someone who I can contact at NIH.

1427
01:21:31.801 --> 01:21:32.789
Thank you, Stan.

1428
01:21:34.638 --> 01:21:35.798
Sure.

1429
01:21:58.328 --> 01:21:59.557
See this green area here?

1430
01:22:01.832 --> 01:22:03.162
I'm sorry.

1431
01:22:06.804 --> 01:22:08.704
Tell me, anybody

1432
01:22:10.007 --> 01:22:11.338
You okay?

1433
01:22:16.414 --> 01:22:18.542
Take the Z-Pak. Okay?

1434
01:22:18.617 --> 01:22:19.606
Jesus!

1435
01:22:20.885 --> 01:22:24.014
Do you really give a damn for me?

1436
01:22:28.594 --> 01:22:30.858
I'm sorry, Mr. Randall.
That credit card is declined.

1437
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:34.029
About a thing that's bothering me

1438
01:22:34.099 --> 01:22:36.932
The benefits of chelation,
every toxic metal is removed.

1439
01:22:37.002 --> 01:22:39.470
I was a rambling pony

1440
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:40.971
We've achieved complete remission

1441
01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.270
in patients with
advanced metastatic cancer,

1442
01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.066
MS...

1443
01:22:45.277 --> 01:22:46.266
Fuck!

1444
01:22:46.411 --> 01:22:47.878
...Parkinson's, lupus.

1445
01:22:48.715 --> 01:22:51.239
This therapy changes people's lives.

1446
01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.549
He forgot "world peace. "

1447
01:22:55.121 --> 01:22:57.520
Are you saying to me
that we flew 2,000 miles,

1448
01:22:57.589 --> 01:23:00.218
on our own nickel, so you can tell me
that our appointment's been postponed?

1449
01:23:01.293 --> 01:23:02.487
For two weeks?

1450
01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:05.296
I'd like to talk to Dr. Rosenblum, okay?

1451
01:23:05.798 --> 01:23:07.890
Do I look like I care?

1452
01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:11.726
I don't give a shit where he is!
I don't understand...

1453
01:23:13.306 --> 01:23:15.297
Get the head of the hospital on the phone.

1454
01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:17.600
We've arranged our entire schedule
around that,

1455
01:23:17.677 --> 01:23:18.702
and then you come and you tell me...

1456
01:23:18.779 --> 01:23:21.679
No, you don't understand. Okay?
We waited two weeks...

1457
01:23:22.048 --> 01:23:25.142
I would like to talk
to the head of the hospital about it.

1458
01:23:27.186 --> 01:23:28.176
Hey.

1459
01:23:31.024 --> 01:23:32.013
Hey.

1460
01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:34.223
- I am so fed up with those people.
- I want to go home.

1461
01:23:34.295 --> 01:23:35.785
Okay, look, we can do the test,
and then go home, okay?

1462
01:23:35.863 --> 01:23:36.920
Randall.

1463
01:23:36.996 --> 01:23:39.522
There's just all this red tape
and all this new protocol...

1464
01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.660
Don't try to sell me! Please! Okay?
I'm not going to get better.

1465
01:23:42.936 --> 01:23:46.599
- That's bullshit.
- This is bullshit. I'm tired and I'm bored.

1466
01:23:46.674 --> 01:23:48.267
What are you bored of?

1467
01:23:48.343 --> 01:23:50.776
Parkinson's isn't my life!
I have Parkinson's.

1468
01:23:50.844 --> 01:23:53.541
Why can't I just live my life
instead of becoming this project?

1469
01:23:53.615 --> 01:23:55.605
Do you know that
what's ahead of me is bad enough?

1470
01:23:55.849 --> 01:23:57.339
- Don't you want to get...
- No!

1471
01:23:57.619 --> 01:24:00.281
You want. This has become
way too important to you.

1472
01:24:00.521 --> 01:24:02.148
What are you talking about?
Don't you want to get better?

1473
01:24:02.289 --> 01:24:06.783
Yes! Desperately! It's not going to happen.
All right? News flash, there's no cure.

1474
01:24:08.563 --> 01:24:11.225
Apparently you need to know
that I'll get better in order to love me.

1475
01:24:12.367 --> 01:24:13.629
That's insane.

1476
01:24:23.713 --> 01:24:25.703
You need to get your stuff
out of my apartment.

1477
01:24:26.147 --> 01:24:27.638
What the hell?

1478
01:24:28.317 --> 01:24:32.116
You're on the fast track, Randall.
Chicago, then management.

1479
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:33.948
Next stop, CEO.

1480
01:24:34.957 --> 01:24:36.651
You can't do that
with a sick person holding you back.

1481
01:24:36.725 --> 01:24:37.886
I can do anything I want.

1482
01:24:38.294 --> 01:24:39.625
I know.

1483
01:24:42.498 --> 01:24:44.159
You're a good man.

1484
01:24:44.734 --> 01:24:46.895
In fact, you're a wonderful man.

1485
01:24:46.969 --> 01:24:49.062
Much better
than you give yourself credit for.

1486
01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:53.069
Nobody wants to be
the one who runs away.

1487
01:24:53.343 --> 01:24:55.833
- I'm not running away.
- It's not your choice.

1488
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:04.082
Let's just go home.
We can even make love.

1489
01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:09.248
And then you have to leave.

1490
01:25:23.874 --> 01:25:25.205
This is so stupid.

1491
01:25:25.275 --> 01:25:26.367
Stop.

1492
01:25:31.248 --> 01:25:32.580
We don't have to do this.

1493
01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:34.543
Good-bye.

1494
01:27:08.315 --> 01:27:10.875
Hi. You have reached M. Murdock.

1495
01:27:10.951 --> 01:27:14.717
If I'm not picking up, it's probably
because I don't want to talk to you.

1496
01:27:18.492 --> 01:27:20.825
This is actually sad.

1497
01:27:21.896 --> 01:27:24.057
Are you trying to get it
in the actual garbage,

1498
01:27:24.131 --> 01:27:25.690
or just around it, to piss it off?

1499
01:27:32.907 --> 01:27:34.568
Stan! What's up?

1500
01:27:34.842 --> 01:27:38.335
What's fucking up is your friend,
Lisa-Cassie, whatever her name is,

1501
01:27:38.413 --> 01:27:41.405
is having a pajama party
at some rich guy's house this evening.

1502
01:27:41.683 --> 01:27:42.775
Pajama party?

1503
01:27:42.851 --> 01:27:43.840
What's a pajama party?

1504
01:27:44.252 --> 01:27:46.447
Is that, like, girls wearing pajamas?
Getting naked?

1505
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:51.515
I thought maybe you might bring by
a little vitamin V, some little men in blue.

1506
01:27:51.793 --> 01:27:55.024
Stan, I'd love to. I don't think I can.
I'm feeling a little...

1507
01:27:55.096 --> 01:27:56.086
What are you doing?

1508
01:27:56.165 --> 01:27:57.529
Yes, Stan, it's me, Jamie.

1509
01:27:57.599 --> 01:27:59.999
I'll totally be there. See you later. Bye.

1510
01:28:00.268 --> 01:28:02.237
Hey, you and I are going to a pajama party.

1511
01:28:02.304 --> 01:28:04.864
So, you should get ready,
'cause I'm in pajamas.

1512
01:28:05.741 --> 01:28:06.833
I'm having second thoughts, Jamie.

1513
01:28:06.909 --> 01:28:08.671
I haven't been to a pajama party
since 4th grade.

1514
01:28:08.743 --> 01:28:10.210
What if people start
taking their clothes off?

1515
01:28:10.279 --> 01:28:12.804
Oh, my God! I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

1516
01:28:12.882 --> 01:28:13.974
You're the one who wanted to come.

1517
01:28:14.050 --> 01:28:15.244
Will people have to see me naked?

1518
01:28:15.318 --> 01:28:16.717
I can't even pee in front of other people.

1519
01:28:16.786 --> 01:28:17.775
You have a beautiful body.

1520
01:28:17.853 --> 01:28:20.378
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you, you have a beautiful body.

1521
01:28:20.456 --> 01:28:22.253
It's actually very upsetting
when you say that.

1522
01:28:25.061 --> 01:28:27.052
Well, look who's here!

1523
01:28:27.396 --> 01:28:30.389
How working class. Love it.

1524
01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:32.392
Come in.

1525
01:28:49.086 --> 01:28:54.080
How the fuck am I supposed to do
good medicine on 50 patients a day?

1526
01:28:54.758 --> 01:28:56.089
Plus rounds.

1527
01:28:56.426 --> 01:29:00.090
And phone calls every day with family...
Fucking idiots,

1528
01:29:00.331 --> 01:29:04.096
telling you, "No, you're wrong,"
because they looked it up on the Internet.

1529
01:29:06.104 --> 01:29:10.097
I fight over billing,
I fight over prescription coverage.

1530
01:29:11.442 --> 01:29:15.538
The insurance companies
are dedicated to not paying you.

1531
01:29:17.115 --> 01:29:20.107
And the big law firms, man,
they're just waiting.

1532
01:29:20.451 --> 01:29:25.445
They're just betting you're going to
make that one big mistake.

1533
01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:31.121
This profession for me,
it was a higher calling.

1534
01:29:31.462 --> 01:29:33.521
You know? Make people's lives better.

1535
01:29:39.037 --> 01:29:40.869
And look at me.

1536
01:29:43.975 --> 01:29:45.466
Here they are, for Christ's sake.

1537
01:29:45.711 --> 01:29:48.645
Randall, get up from the floor!
Come with me.

1538
01:29:48.946 --> 01:29:51.438
Come with me. Come on! Come on!

1539
01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:52.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you all right?

1540
01:29:53.052 --> 01:29:56.078
Go forth, my son. Be fruitful and multiply.

1541
01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:02.324
The thing about the software business
is it's very, very volatile.

1542
01:30:02.661 --> 01:30:06.222
You never know where
the financial model's going to go.

1543
01:30:06.498 --> 01:30:08.625
It changes every six months.

1544
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:11.102
And you never know
what these hospitals are gonna want.

1545
01:30:11.171 --> 01:30:14.231
One day
it's peer-to-peer connectivity,

1546
01:30:14.307 --> 01:30:18.640
then next it's top-down integration
with their preexisting infrastructure.

1547
01:30:21.514 --> 01:30:22.776
You can touch them, if you want.

1548
01:30:23.116 --> 01:30:24.777
Oh! Oh.

1549
01:30:26.019 --> 01:30:27.350
Thank you.

1550
01:30:29.523 --> 01:30:30.921
- This way. You'll see.
- No, no, no.

1551
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.855
- I don't think we should do this.
- I have a surprise for you.

1552
01:30:32.926 --> 01:30:35.259
No, no, no. Turn around.
I've got a surprise.

1553
01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:38.092
This is my homegirl, Khae.

1554
01:30:39.266 --> 01:30:40.255
Whoa!

1555
01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.862
She's Thai.

1556
01:30:43.369 --> 01:30:44.701
And I'm Thai-curious.

1557
01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.407
Engine turning over won't you start?

1558
01:30:49.376 --> 01:30:52.607
This one's come to tear me all apart

1559
01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:55.541
She's Jamie-curious.

1560
01:30:57.918 --> 01:31:00.978
Be still my heart

1561
01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:03.148
- So am I.
- No, no, wait. I don't...

1562
01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:06.255
Engine turning over won't you start?

1563
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:09.988
This one's come to tear me all apart

1564
01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:12.157
Be still my heart

1565
01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:14.725
Did I mention that
I just took my company public?

1566
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:16.264
It's a pretty exciting thing

1567
01:31:16.338 --> 01:31:18.498
because you work
on something for so long,

1568
01:31:18.572 --> 01:31:21.269
and then
when it comes, it's...

1569
01:31:22.277 --> 01:31:24.507
You know, you see the fruits bear...

1570
01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:29.243
Okay! So, I really have
mixed feelings about this.

1571
01:31:33.255 --> 01:31:35.746
We like Jamie.

1572
01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:39.721
We like Jamie very much.

1573
01:31:40.196 --> 01:31:42.823
Oh. Oh.

1574
01:31:43.399 --> 01:31:44.559
What's wrong?

1575
01:32:03.954 --> 01:32:05.944
Sorry! I'm sorry!

1576
01:32:06.289 --> 01:32:07.950
- Josh!
Be careful.

1577
01:32:08.559 --> 01:32:11.220
- I'm sorry. Stan.
Hey, Pfizie.

1578
01:32:11.294 --> 01:32:12.761
Josh! Ow!

1579
01:32:15.132 --> 01:32:16.120
Josh! Oh!

1580
01:32:16.299 --> 01:32:18.291
Wait! We were just talking!

1581
01:32:18.702 --> 01:32:20.795
- Hi.
- Hi. We got to go.

1582
01:32:20.871 --> 01:32:21.860
Now?
- Josh!

1583
01:32:22.138 --> 01:32:24.232
- It was a pleasure to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

1584
01:32:24.308 --> 01:32:25.332
We'll keep in touch.

1585
01:32:27.344 --> 01:32:29.244
It feels like a frozen Popsicle.

1586
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.012
Shit. I didn't know that could even happen.

1587
01:32:32.082 --> 01:32:34.949
It's very rare, but it happens.

1588
01:32:35.018 --> 01:32:37.646
- Do you think they'll have to amputate?
- Shut the fuck up, Josh, and drive!

1589
01:32:37.721 --> 01:32:38.711
Bad joke.

1590
01:32:39.923 --> 01:32:42.859
Fuck! Sorry. I was looking for the shift!

1591
01:32:43.428 --> 01:32:44.986
- So fucking...
- Sorry.

1592
01:32:45.363 --> 01:32:46.659
You know, for whatever it's worth,

1593
01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:49.359
this has truly been
the best night of my life.

1594
01:32:49.434 --> 01:32:50.458
That's wonderful.

1595
01:32:50.535 --> 01:32:52.195
No, seriously. I'm not even kidding.

1596
01:32:52.436 --> 01:32:53.734
And I have you to thank for it.

1597
01:32:53.805 --> 01:32:56.831
I mean, I never thought I would have
an experience like this ever in my life.

1598
01:32:57.075 --> 01:33:01.375
And this is the incredible thing.
This is why I'm so happy right now.

1599
01:33:01.613 --> 01:33:06.641
Because I fucked that girl.
Oh, my shit, I fucked that girl!

1600
01:33:06.718 --> 01:33:07.708
And I'm thinking to myself,

1601
01:33:07.786 --> 01:33:11.448
"Oh, my God, this is empty!
I feel absolutely nothing at all! "

1602
01:33:11.956 --> 01:33:13.424
- That's great, Josh.
- Yeah.

1603
01:33:13.492 --> 01:33:16.255
All those years I was so jealous of you
for having empty sex,

1604
01:33:16.327 --> 01:33:18.193
and now I was the one
having the empty sex,

1605
01:33:18.264 --> 01:33:21.198
and I realized in that moment
that if I hadn't experienced it,

1606
01:33:21.532 --> 01:33:25.799
I wouldn't have known
how much I didn't want it. You know?

1607
01:33:25.871 --> 01:33:30.672
And now I can go back home to Farrah
and feel really good about myself

1608
01:33:30.743 --> 01:33:34.975
for the first time in my entire life.

1609
01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.579
And it's all because of you, Jamie.

1610
01:33:36.815 --> 01:33:38.680
It's all because of my big brother Jamie,

1611
01:33:38.751 --> 01:33:41.117
with the enormous cock
that won't go down!

1612
01:33:42.422 --> 01:33:43.821
So thank you, brother!

1613
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:45.317
Sorry! My bad!

1614
01:33:49.095 --> 01:33:51.927
Plus, my Pfizer stock's up 40%.

1615
01:33:58.672 --> 01:33:59.696
- Hi.
- Hi.

1616
01:33:59.773 --> 01:34:02.435
- Can I help you?
- I'm having a drug reaction.

1617
01:34:02.676 --> 01:34:03.973
What kind of drug reaction?

1618
01:34:07.248 --> 01:34:08.714
Oh. Oh.

1619
01:34:10.717 --> 01:34:12.709
Just take a seat
and we'll be right with you.

1620
01:34:22.296 --> 01:34:23.456
What?

1621
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.132
Chicago.

1622
01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:30.564
I got it.

1623
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:35.699
Dude. Congratulations!
That is unbelievable.

1624
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:40.474
Jamie, that's everything that
you've wanted. That's incredible, man.

1625
01:34:40.715 --> 01:34:44.549
I'm very proud of you. I'm not surprised,
but I am very proud of you.

1626
01:34:44.819 --> 01:34:46.480
You know who's going to be thrilled,
is Mom and Dad.

1627
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:50.122
Jamie Randall makes good.
That's incredible, man.

1628
01:34:50.191 --> 01:34:52.160
You should be very, very proud of yourself.

1629
01:34:52.227 --> 01:34:53.216
Mmm.

1630
01:34:59.568 --> 01:35:01.866
If you're going to serve beef bourguignon,

1631
01:35:01.937 --> 01:35:03.905
you should at least offer
a proper Burgundy.

1632
01:35:04.239 --> 01:35:06.571
Or a Pinot, for Christ's sake.

1633
01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:13.806
Randall.

1634
01:35:15.083 --> 01:35:16.072
Maggie.

1635
01:35:19.388 --> 01:35:21.379
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Jeremy.

1636
01:35:21.858 --> 01:35:23.519
- Justin.
- Justin! Justin.

1637
01:35:25.927 --> 01:35:27.259
I'll go get the car.

1638
01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:29.758
That would be great, Justin.

1639
01:35:42.012 --> 01:35:43.672
I... I was...

1640
01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.020
I tried to call you...

1641
01:35:52.289 --> 01:35:53.847
I'm with someone.

1642
01:35:53.924 --> 01:35:55.686
Yeah, I can see that.

1643
01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:01.457
So...

1644
01:36:03.867 --> 01:36:05.061
How are you?

1645
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:07.859
I'm good.

1646
01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:10.128
Good.

1647
01:36:12.176 --> 01:36:13.370
Come on.

1648
01:36:14.311 --> 01:36:15.869
I gotta go.

1649
01:36:16.347 --> 01:36:17.541
Maggie?

1650
01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.147
It

1651
01:36:27.659 --> 01:36:28.990
was nice to see you.

1652
01:36:34.499 --> 01:36:36.228
You're killing me, Randall.

1653
01:36:37.335 --> 01:36:41.067
- Hey. There he is! You ready to celebrate?
- Hey.

1654
01:36:41.739 --> 01:36:42.728
Maggie!

1655
01:36:44.242 --> 01:36:46.268
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are you?

1656
01:36:48.012 --> 01:36:49.240
What are you celebrating?

1657
01:36:49.514 --> 01:36:52.416
This young rock star is about to
take Chicago by storm.

1658
01:36:56.922 --> 01:36:58.048
You got Chicago?

1659
01:37:02.194 --> 01:37:05.129
Congratulations. It was good
to see you, Bruce. I should go.

1660
01:37:05.196 --> 01:37:06.186
Nice to see you, Maggie.

1661
01:37:07.433 --> 01:37:08.525
Peace.

1662
01:37:08.968 --> 01:37:10.060
Uh...

1663
01:37:15.374 --> 01:37:18.309
So, I called it, didn't I call it?
What'd I tell you? Say, "I called it. "

1664
01:37:18.377 --> 01:37:19.844
- You should've put money on it.
- I called it.

1665
01:37:19.912 --> 01:37:21.141
Where you gonna live?

1666
01:37:21.214 --> 01:37:23.977
Downtown, maybe.
Somewhere far away from my family.

1667
01:37:24.049 --> 01:37:25.311
Downtown?

1668
01:37:25.552 --> 01:37:28.816
You? You want Near North, man.
Pussy!

1669
01:37:29.555 --> 01:37:32.218
And bistros, bars,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

1670
01:37:34.727 --> 01:37:36.889
Why don't I move out near you?
The 'burbs.

1671
01:37:36.997 --> 01:37:38.487
We'll go get a beer every once in a while.

1672
01:37:38.565 --> 01:37:41.227
Nah. You don't want to do that. No.

1673
01:37:41.568 --> 01:37:42.728
Why not?

1674
01:37:50.978 --> 01:37:54.037
I got a big raise, buddy. Big raise.

1675
01:37:54.581 --> 01:37:55.913
- You're kidding me.
- Thanks to you!

1676
01:37:56.717 --> 01:37:57.775
Those bastards.

1677
01:37:58.318 --> 01:38:01.652
Buddy, I was never going to get Chicago.
I'm too valuable to them in the field.

1678
01:38:01.756 --> 01:38:02.745
I can't believe this.

1679
01:38:02.823 --> 01:38:05.758
Give me some credit!
It takes a sophisticated eye

1680
01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:08.624
to spot talent in colossal fuck-ups
such as yourself.

1681
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:11.760
- I don't understand.
- Don't be so naive.

1682
01:38:11.832 --> 01:38:13.094
I didn't actually want to go to Chicago.

1683
01:38:13.167 --> 01:38:14.657
I wanted you to think
I wanted to go to Chicago,

1684
01:38:14.735 --> 01:38:16.100
so you'd want to go to Chicago.

1685
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:17.728
So you'd work your ass off to get there.

1686
01:38:17.805 --> 01:38:19.170
- Oh, Bruce, this is unbelievable.
- Me,

1687
01:38:19.373 --> 01:38:21.842
I love the road! I love a stinky motel!

1688
01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:25.146
I love the barren back roads
and strip malls of the heartland!

1689
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.404
That's what I love.

1690
01:38:26.481 --> 01:38:27.812
Why would I want to live
in my own house?

1691
01:38:27.882 --> 01:38:28.906
That I pay for?

1692
01:38:28.983 --> 01:38:30.451
Why would I want to
watch my kids play Little League?

1693
01:38:30.953 --> 01:38:33.444
Why the fuck would I want to
sleep in the same bed as my wife?

1694
01:38:33.522 --> 01:38:35.456
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

1695
01:39:06.456 --> 01:39:07.548
Okay, so...
Okay, so...

1696
01:39:10.159 --> 01:39:12.627
- What's...
- Talk?

1697
01:39:12.695 --> 01:39:13.889
- Yeah.
- All right.

1698
01:39:14.665 --> 01:39:17.189
- Hi, there. Hi. I'm Maggie Murdock.
- Hello!

1699
01:39:18.701 --> 01:39:22.159
I'm about to have
delicious reprobate sex with...

1700
01:39:23.706 --> 01:39:24.696
What's your name?

1701
01:39:24.775 --> 01:39:26.003
Oh, come on.

1702
01:39:26.076 --> 01:39:29.067
Oh, right, right. Jamie something.

1703
01:39:29.145 --> 01:39:34.048
And we're taping it so that he can
always remember how totally hot I am.

1704
01:39:34.285 --> 01:39:35.479
Was.

1705
01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:37.850
Kids, if you're watching this,

1706
01:39:37.921 --> 01:39:40.287
you put it back in Mommy's
secret hiding spot right now

1707
01:39:40.357 --> 01:39:43.224
or you will be sorry.
There will be consequences!

1708
01:39:45.129 --> 01:39:46.460
What else?

1709
01:39:47.264 --> 01:39:48.390
Um...

1710
01:39:51.735 --> 01:39:53.726
Just how happy I am,

1711
01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:56.930
in this moment, right now.

1712
01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:01.879
The way the light's
hitting that face of yours.

1713
01:40:03.681 --> 01:40:06.776
There's this little breeze
coming in through the window.

1714
01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:13.084
It doesn't matter if I have 10,000
more moments like this, or

1715
01:40:15.026 --> 01:40:17.153
just this one, because

1716
01:40:20.265 --> 01:40:21.755
it's all the same.

1717
01:40:24.303 --> 01:40:26.497
Yeah. Just that.

1718
01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.700
Right now, this moment.

1719
01:40:35.715 --> 01:40:37.376
I have this.

1720
01:40:51.063 --> 01:40:52.189
No. Damn it!

1721
01:40:52.965 --> 01:40:54.593
Richard! Richard!

1722
01:40:54.935 --> 01:40:56.458
Where is she?

1723
01:41:14.588 --> 01:41:21.551
I been drifting along
in the same stale shoes

1724
01:41:23.297 --> 01:41:28.894
Loose ends tying the noose
in the back of my mind

1725
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:30.528
Come on! Come on.

1726
01:41:32.539 --> 01:41:33.564
Hey!

1727
01:41:33.941 --> 01:41:35.067
Hey!

1728
01:41:36.843 --> 01:41:40.041
To where the puzzles and pagans lay

1729
01:41:41.416 --> 01:41:42.780
Maggie!

1730
01:41:44.051 --> 01:41:46.485
Hey! Mag!

1731
01:41:50.558 --> 01:41:51.547
Jamie?

1732
01:41:51.959 --> 01:41:52.948
Pull over.

1733
01:41:53.195 --> 01:41:55.025
No, I can't "pull over"!

1734
01:41:55.363 --> 01:41:57.024
Just for a second! Pull over!

1735
01:42:00.235 --> 01:42:03.671
I need to talk

1736
01:42:03.972 --> 01:42:04.996
to you.

1737
01:42:05.874 --> 01:42:09.071
I don't want to talk to you.

1738
01:42:09.144 --> 01:42:15.606
When I wake up
someone will sweep up my lazy bones

1739
01:42:17.119 --> 01:42:23.616
And we will rise in the cool of the evening

1740
01:42:25.461 --> 01:42:27.224
Wait, wait. Okay.

1741
01:42:28.565 --> 01:42:30.828
Open the door. Okay.

1742
01:42:38.007 --> 01:42:39.167
Sorry.

1743
01:42:42.077 --> 01:42:43.773
- I need you.
- Please go away.

1744
01:42:44.147 --> 01:42:46.138
I drove a really long way to say that.

1745
01:42:46.216 --> 01:42:47.376
What? Am I supposed to be impressed?

1746
01:42:48.017 --> 01:42:49.041
I don't know. Yes.

1747
01:42:51.087 --> 01:42:54.056
Look, can you just get off the bus
so we can talk for a second?

1748
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:56.986
- Just for a second.
- We're on a schedule.

1749
01:42:57.628 --> 01:42:59.288
Five minutes. Please.

1750
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:02.922
You guys don't mind
if we take five minutes, do you?

1751
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.524
He's handsome.

1752
01:43:05.602 --> 01:43:06.933
- Five minutes.
- He is.

1753
01:43:07.505 --> 01:43:08.665
Five minutes, then I'll let you go.

1754
01:43:19.049 --> 01:43:21.210
I'm full of shit, okay?

1755
01:43:23.454 --> 01:43:27.414
No, I'm knowingly full of shit.

1756
01:43:30.461 --> 01:43:31.792
Because...

1757
01:43:32.964 --> 01:43:34.329
Because...

1758
01:43:36.767 --> 01:43:37.928
I have...

1759
01:43:38.436 --> 01:43:43.271
I have never cared about anybody,
or anything, in my entire life.

1760
01:43:43.742 --> 01:43:46.176
And the thing is,
everybody just kind of accepted that.

1761
01:43:46.244 --> 01:43:48.269
Like, "That's just Jamie! "

1762
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:53.140
And then you...

1763
01:43:56.388 --> 01:43:57.720
Jesus.

1764
01:43:58.423 --> 01:43:59.583
You.

1765
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:06.590
You.

1766
01:44:11.269 --> 01:44:12.532
You didn't see me that way.

1767
01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:18.169
I have never known anyone

1768
01:44:19.845 --> 01:44:23.838
who actually believed that I was enough.

1769
01:44:26.352 --> 01:44:27.650
Until I met you.

1770
01:44:35.695 --> 01:44:38.062
And then you made me believe it, too.

1771
01:44:41.033 --> 01:44:44.003
So, unfortunately,

1772
01:44:45.871 --> 01:44:47.362
I need you.

1773
01:44:48.208 --> 01:44:49.869
And you need me.

1774
01:44:51.812 --> 01:44:52.972
No, I don't.

1775
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.404
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1776
01:44:55.482 --> 01:44:56.507
Yes, you do.

1777
01:44:56.884 --> 01:44:58.077
Stop it. Stop saying that.

1778
01:44:58.919 --> 01:45:00.910
- You need someone to take care of you.
- No, I don't.

1779
01:45:01.188 --> 01:45:02.781
Everybody does.

1780
01:45:11.031 --> 01:45:13.091
I'm going to need you
more than you need me.

1781
01:45:15.469 --> 01:45:17.734
- That's okay.
- No, it's not!

1782
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.367
It isn't fair.

1783
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:24.707
I have places to go.

1784
01:45:25.947 --> 01:45:26.936
You'll go there.

1785
01:45:28.916 --> 01:45:30.474
I just may have to carry you.

1786
01:45:37.593 --> 01:45:40.459
I can't ask you to do that.

1787
01:45:42.431 --> 01:45:43.591
You didn't.

1788
01:45:50.239 --> 01:45:51.331
Hey,

1789
01:45:52.508 --> 01:45:55.170
let's just say in some

1790
01:45:56.212 --> 01:45:59.578
alternate universe,
there's a couple that's just like us, okay?

1791
01:45:59.648 --> 01:46:03.049
Only she's healthy and he's perfect.

1792
01:46:03.786 --> 01:46:07.780
And their world is about how much money
that they're gonna spend on vacation,

1793
01:46:07.857 --> 01:46:10.120
or who's in a bad mood that day,

1794
01:46:10.192 --> 01:46:12.821
or whether they feel guilty
about having a cleaning lady.

1795
01:46:16.299 --> 01:46:17.459
I don't want to be those people.

1796
01:46:19.102 --> 01:46:20.591
I want us.

1797
01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:24.800
You.

1798
01:46:27.043 --> 01:46:28.203
This.

1799
01:46:44.994 --> 01:46:47.725
I used to worry a lot about
who I'd be when I grew up.

1800
01:46:50.333 --> 01:46:53.326
You know,
like how much money I'd make or...

1801
01:46:54.472 --> 01:46:56.406
Someday I'd become some big deal.

1802
01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:02.277
Sometimes the thing you most want
doesn't happen.

1803
01:47:03.581 --> 01:47:08.245
And sometimes the thing
you never expect to happen, does.

1804
01:47:09.487 --> 01:47:13.321
Like giving up my job in Chicago
and everything,

1805
01:47:14.325 --> 01:47:17.853
and deciding to stay
and apply to med school.

1806
01:47:19.363 --> 01:47:20.854
I don't know.

1807
01:47:21.266 --> 01:47:23.427
You meet thousands of people,

1808
01:47:24.436 --> 01:47:26.768
and none of them really touch you.

1809
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.531
And then you meet one person,

1810
01:47:32.544 --> 01:47:36.208
and your life is changed forever.

1811
01:47:39.518 --> 01:47:43.045
Suppose I never ever saw you

1812
01:47:44.957 --> 01:47:47.721
Suppose we never ever called

1813
01:47:49.861 --> 01:47:53.628
Suppose I kept on singing love songs

1814
01:47:53.699 --> 01:47:58.295
Just to break my own fall

1815
01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:02.637
Just to break my fall

1816
01:48:03.609 --> 01:48:08.444
Just to break my fall

1817
01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:13.377
Just to break my fall

1818
01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:18.781
Break my fall
Break my fall

1819
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:23.993
All my friends say
that of course it's gonna get better

1820
01:48:24.063 --> 01:48:25.224
Gonna get better

1821
01:48:25.299 --> 01:48:31.795
Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better!

1822
01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:35.172
I never love nobody fully

1823
01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:40.581
Always one foot on the ground

1824
01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:46.710
And by protecting my heart truly

1825
01:48:46.788 --> 01:48:51.384
I got lost in the sounds

1826
01:48:51.459 --> 01:48:56.624
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1827
01:48:56.698 --> 01:49:01.829
I hear in my mind all of these words

1828
01:49:01.903 --> 01:49:07.000
I hear in my mind all of this music

1829
01:49:07.075 --> 01:49:11.808
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1830
01:49:12.113 --> 01:49:17.016
I hear in my mind all of these voices

1831
01:49:17.085 --> 01:49:22.251
I hear in my mind all of these words

1832
01:49:22.324 --> 01:49:27.694
I hear in my mind all of this music

1833
01:49:27.763 --> 01:49:31.961
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

1834
01:49:32.768 --> 01:49:37.068
It breaks my heart

1835
01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:42.274
When it breaks my heart

1836
01:49:43.312 --> 01:49:47.373
When it breaks my heart

1837
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:50.751
When it breaks my heart

1838
01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.310
Breaks my heart

1839
01:49:53.389 --> 01:49:55.517
When it breaks my heart

1840
01:49:55.926 --> 01:50:03.792
When it breaks my heart
