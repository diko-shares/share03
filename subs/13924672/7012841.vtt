2
00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:17.429
Miss Angel?

3
00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.098
Camp's packed up
and ready to hit the trail.

4
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.101
We should reach the outpost
by dusk, ma'am.

5
00:01:25.803 --> 00:01:27.339
Thank you, Mr. Foliet.

6
00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:38.916
<i>I've traveled
hundreds of miles from my home</i>

7
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:41.885
<i>to a place some
has referred to as hell.</i>

8
00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:44.289
<i>A beautiful hell,
if you will.</i>

9
00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.790
<i>And tucked away
into this corner of the world</i>

10
00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:48.226
<i>that few have ever been</i>

11
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.960
<i>is a world that might
only be fit</i>

12
00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:51.895
<i>for the devil himself.</i>

13
00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:20.458
<i>This is a land full of violence
where outlaws,</i>

14
00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:23.194
<i>pistoleers,
deserters and murderers</i>

15
00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:27.031
<i>have been calling home
for the past few years.</i>

16
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.600
<i>But now that the great war
has ended,</i>

17
00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.001
<i>the east has vowed
to end terror</i>

18
00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:33.204
<i>and lawlessness
across the land.</i>

19
00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:45.983
<i>And so the capture
and the execution</i>

20
00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:48.620
<i>of evil men begins
as bounty hunters,</i>

21
00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:50.522
<i>scalpers and even the Army</i>

22
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.990
<i>move in to exact their view
of law and order</i>

23
00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:55.993
<i>upon these expansive
yet bloody lands.</i>

24
00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:02.066
We close?

25
00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:05.503
The outpost is just
right up ahead.

26
00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:09.574
All right.

27
00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:12.377
<i>Man's idea of
civilization has arrived.</i>

28
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.878
<i>Arizona is what they call it.</i>

29
00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:19.850
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

30
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.461
All right.
Captain's up ahead here.

31
00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:59.056
- Captain.
- More lambs to the slaughter?

32
00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.427
This here is Annabelle Angel.

33
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:06.096
I know who she is, Ebb.

34
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.567
You arrived a bit earlier
than we originally expected.

35
00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:15.973
Apologies, sir,
but I had a wonderful guide.

36
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.075
I do hope
I'm not intruding.

37
00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.043
Intruding?

38
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:22.079
No.

39
00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:25.082
But I have a question to ask,
Miss Angel.

40
00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:29.421
Do thoughts of death
visit you often,

41
00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:31.556
or are you just
simple minded?

42
00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:35.393
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

43
00:04:35.427 --> 00:04:39.096
Simple minded would be
the answer, then.

44
00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.999
The reason I ask is because

45
00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.470
no respectable woman
in her right mind

46
00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:48.173
ventures to these parts.

47
00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:50.175
In fact, the only women
who ever come around here

48
00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:53.378
are looking to spread their legs
for a few pennies.

49
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.079
You understand
my meaning now?

50
00:04:56.113 --> 00:04:59.517
I do, and my response
is quite simple, indeed.

51
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:02.119
You are here to do a job,
if I'm not mistaken?

52
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.156
Get to the point.

53
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.024
I am as well, sir.

54
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.327
It's the job that's made me
travel all these miles.

55
00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:14.265
Writing an article for,
what is it?

56
00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:16.301
<i>The San Francisco Examiner.</i>

57
00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:20.505
Right. And this stupid article
is worth possibly being raped

58
00:05:20.538 --> 00:05:22.574
and murdered,

59
00:05:22.607 --> 00:05:25.510
shot, cut,

60
00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:29.046
or otherwise maimed
in this godforsaken desert?

61
00:05:30.482 --> 00:05:32.049
It is.

62
00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:35.453
And this article,
it's gonna be on the men

63
00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:37.222
we're chasing down out here,

64
00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:40.425
and the good job
that my men are doing?

65
00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:42.059
Yes.

66
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.027
Mm.

67
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:45.497
Well, I don't have time

68
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.066
to dig deeper into your logic,
Miss Angel,

69
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.068
but please know

70
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.505
that I cannot afford
any type of protection

71
00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:57.375
for you while you're here,
so you'll be on your own.

72
00:05:58.176 --> 00:06:00.345
I understand.

73
00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:03.448
And if any harm should
come to you while you're here,

74
00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:06.284
it will not be the fault
of the United States Army,

75
00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:10.154
and I better not read that
in any newspaper.

76
00:06:10.188 --> 00:06:13.056
The responsibility
of some crazy woman

77
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.627
that wants to immortalize
herself in print

78
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.462
will not be on my head.

79
00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:19.664
I'm not trying
to immortalize myself.

80
00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:23.234
Sir.

81
00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:24.736
Pardon?

82
00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:27.705
You say "sir"
when you address me.

83
00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:30.775
I've earned it.

84
00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:33.076
Ebb, show her
the lay of the land.

85
00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:37.315
You write your article true,
Miss Angel.

86
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.620
You write about the cutthroats
and savages

87
00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:45.823
that we're trying to exterminate
from this land.

88
00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:48.560
Well, sir,

89
00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:51.563
I guarantee you that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

90
00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:53.398
Good.

91
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:56.401
Then I expect to see you soon,
I should think.

92
00:07:01.172 --> 00:07:02.707
- Sir.
- Ebb.

93
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:07.812
Crazy woman.

94
00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:14.819
Well, I'm sure that could've
gone a bit better.

95
00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:16.321
Is he always
that inviting?

96
00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:19.390
Miss Angel,
listen here now.

97
00:07:19.424 --> 00:07:22.327
Hensley ain't one to go
crossing around here.

98
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.329
He's the whole show.

99
00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:27.899
He's just as dangerous as any
Joe, John and Harry out here,

100
00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:29.534
if not more so.

101
00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.838
The man has eyes and ears
all over.

102
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.475
So walk lightly in his presence
if you want to avoid trouble.

103
00:07:38.843 --> 00:07:40.845
Are those words sticking
with you, Miss Angel?

104
00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:45.383
Right then.

105
00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:47.385
We should go
get you outfitted.

106
00:07:47.418 --> 00:07:49.554
Get you a place to stay.

107
00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:52.523
Hell, we leave now, we can get
to the Junction by nightfall.

108
00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:54.292
What's Junction?

109
00:07:55.727 --> 00:07:58.329
Just the place you wanted
to write about.

110
00:07:59.464 --> 00:08:01.232
See, those of us
who call this place home

111
00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:05.203
refer to it as a neutral
patch of land, if you will.

112
00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.771
Now, come on.

113
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.324
Howdy.

114
00:09:07.532 --> 00:09:10.535
Well, this here's
the only supply stop.

115
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.443
There's nothing north of us
but Injun territory.

116
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:24.849
Now, most people around here
call this place home.

117
00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:29.353
Mostly because everywhere else,
there's a price on their head.

118
00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:34.325
Well, right over there,
that's a saloon.

119
00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:36.627
Or what we call one,
anyway.

120
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.663
It's a rough place.

121
00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:40.998
You want some answers
or to find someone,

122
00:09:41.032 --> 00:09:43.034
that'd be your best bet.

123
00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:45.603
Right next to it
is Churtle B's Bathhouse.

124
00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:49.574
Nice hot mineral water comes
straight from the hot springs.

125
00:09:49.607 --> 00:09:51.976
Also plays home to most
of the whores in town.

126
00:09:54.946 --> 00:09:56.714
Right around,
trading post.

127
00:09:56.748 --> 00:09:59.951
Lanterns, wood, sheets,
you name it.

128
00:09:59.984 --> 00:10:02.620
Man who runs its name
is Deacon Sparry.

129
00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:04.522
Been here since
the camp's inception.

130
00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:06.891
Also one you might
want to talk to.

131
00:10:06.924 --> 00:10:08.760
Now...

132
00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:11.929
there's one thing to remember
here, Miss Angel,

133
00:10:11.963 --> 00:10:15.333
is that this place don't
quite like the Army much.

134
00:10:15.366 --> 00:10:18.302
They make a lot of coin
off them soldiers.

135
00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:20.371
Interesting sight, seeing some
of these boys in blue

136
00:10:20.404 --> 00:10:22.774
wandering around with the
likes of men you see here.

137
00:10:22.807 --> 00:10:26.410
Were it anywhere else, would be
at the other end of a rope.

138
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:30.348
But they can't touch them
here in the Junction.

139
00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:33.684
You mean this place
is considered

140
00:10:33.718 --> 00:10:37.655
a safe haven for criminals,
Mr. Foliet?

141
00:10:37.688 --> 00:10:40.691
Well, Miss Angel,
you catch on quick.

142
00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:42.426
Why hasn't the Army
raided it?

143
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.929
Listening to Captain Hensley
back there,

144
00:10:44.962 --> 00:10:47.398
you'd think this place
would be in ashes.

145
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:49.734
The Army needs this
place just as much

146
00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:51.969
as everyone else does.

147
00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:54.739
It's an interesting arrangement.

148
00:10:54.772 --> 00:10:57.875
Which is why anywhere else
outside this place is dangerous.

149
00:10:57.909 --> 00:11:00.545
Army's been putting
bounties out.

150
00:11:00.578 --> 00:11:03.581
Attracting folk
from all over the country.

151
00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:05.416
They show up
looking to shoot the man

152
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:07.952
whose face is printed
on that piece of paper.

153
00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:10.354
And the others?

154
00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:14.058
Ha! They're looking to shoot
the new faces that show up,

155
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:17.061
'cause they figure they're
only here for one reason.

156
00:11:17.094 --> 00:11:18.963
Those bounties.

157
00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:22.333
Sounds like a very
violent type of life.

158
00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:25.102
Yup, yup.

159
00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.638
No truer statement's
ever been made, ma'am.

160
00:11:27.672 --> 00:11:29.807
Right over there,
that's your lodging.

161
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:31.475
Go on in and talk to Vern.

162
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:33.811
He's got a room arranged
for your stay.

163
00:11:33.845 --> 00:11:36.447
I suggest you get your
essentials in the morning,

164
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.951
seeing it's getting to
be dark now and, uh, well,

165
00:11:39.984 --> 00:11:43.087
this town can get
a bit rowdy at night.

166
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.893
You be real careful now,
Miss Angel.

167
00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:52.096
I'd hate to see
anything happen to you.

168
00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:56.734
Oh, no.

169
00:11:58.569 --> 00:12:00.071
All right.

170
00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:02.907
Thank you.

171
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.508
Good night, ma'am.

172
00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:06.110
- Good night.
- Night.

173
00:15:43.794 --> 00:15:45.163
That's it now.
Who do you want?

174
00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:46.997
What you got in there?
You got going...

175
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.039
Jericho Ford.

176
00:16:05.816 --> 00:16:08.253
I don't think we'd had the
pleasure of meeting, good sir.

177
00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:09.854
All right, gentlemen.

178
00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:11.689
Looks like we're
in time for a tussle.

179
00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.225
Who's taking bets?

180
00:16:13.258 --> 00:16:15.260
We got Gorn and Jericho.
Who's got what? What do you got?

181
00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:19.763
Oh, more to Jericho.

182
00:16:19.797 --> 00:16:21.665
Who do you want? You got Gorn?

183
00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:23.701
Right.

184
00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:28.105
Speak up, kid.
I think you're going for Gorn.

185
00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:30.275
I believe you want Gorn.

186
00:16:30.308 --> 00:16:34.379
You, sir, are an idiot
going for Jericho.

187
00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:36.747
You want Gorn or Jericho?

188
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.350
We got one for Gorn
and Jericho.

189
00:16:38.383 --> 00:16:41.353
How about you pour me
a little shot there, baby?

190
00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:45.323
One for Jericho.
That's a bad bet, son.

191
00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:46.857
What do you got?

192
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.096
All right. All right, gentlemen.
Good luck.

193
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:54.366
You know I'm good for it.

194
00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:56.834
What are you looking at me for?

195
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:00.905
Darn.

196
00:17:02.006 --> 00:17:04.041
Come on, Jericho.

197
00:17:04.074 --> 00:17:06.311
I've heard
a lot about you.

198
00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:09.381
I'm gonna enjoy this.

199
00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:13.117
Come on now, Gorn!

200
00:17:19.924 --> 00:17:21.259
Come on, Jericho.

201
00:17:22.294 --> 00:17:24.229
All hot air.

202
00:17:24.262 --> 00:17:26.830
No brass balls.

203
00:17:31.001 --> 00:17:33.837
Come on, Jericho!
Get him! Come on!

204
00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:38.243
Take him down!
That's it!

205
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:42.247
Come on!

206
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.884
Not a bad little fight.

207
00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:49.454
Looks like we got
ourselves a round two!

208
00:17:49.487 --> 00:17:50.955
Thanks for that.

209
00:17:52.157 --> 00:17:54.058
Well, that could've been
a bit more graceful.

210
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:57.395
Graceful? I'm trying not to get
my head knocked off in there.

211
00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:00.432
You know, big things
fall hard, Jericho.

212
00:18:02.132 --> 00:18:04.236
Didn't you were in
for dinner and a show.

213
00:18:05.437 --> 00:18:07.272
All right.

214
00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:12.977
All right, here we go.

215
00:18:13.844 --> 00:18:15.313
Round two.

216
00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:17.014
Let's go!

217
00:18:34.499 --> 00:18:36.401
That's what I'm talking about.

218
00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:39.036
Finish him off!
Get in there, Gorn!

219
00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:48.213
Oh!

220
00:18:48.246 --> 00:18:49.913
Whoo!

221
00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:51.915
Get up there!
Come on, get up!

222
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:59.291
Ain't no one
ring the bell yet?

223
00:19:02.893 --> 00:19:04.296
Come on!

224
00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:10.368
Use your head!

225
00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:11.569
Come on!

226
00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:13.438
What are you doing?

227
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:14.872
Ante's on you, Jericho!

228
00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.474
Oh!

229
00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:21.479
He's on the ground!

230
00:19:21.513 --> 00:19:23.047
Finish him off!

231
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.848
Don't let him get up! Come on!

232
00:19:24.882 --> 00:19:26.384
Oh!

233
00:19:26.418 --> 00:19:28.420
I felt that.

234
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.542
Well...

235
00:19:53.077 --> 00:19:57.081
That is, as they say, that.

236
00:19:59.451 --> 00:20:01.186
You gonna be
at the Longfellow?

237
00:20:01.219 --> 00:20:03.053
I'll see you.

238
00:20:03.087 --> 00:20:05.156
All right, good.

239
00:20:37.155 --> 00:20:39.157
You best be careful
around here, lady.

240
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.024
You might make a man
awful nervous,

241
00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:42.527
following him around
like you're doing.

242
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.263
She ain't following you, Ford.

243
00:20:45.296 --> 00:20:48.233
Don't flatter yourself.

244
00:20:48.266 --> 00:20:50.402
She got better taste
in men than that.

245
00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.035
I do.

246
00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:53.405
I mean, I don't...

247
00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:55.540
I mean, I wasn't...

248
00:20:55.573 --> 00:20:58.243
Wait, let me get
my words about me.

249
00:20:59.244 --> 00:21:00.512
I wasn't following you.

250
00:21:00.545 --> 00:21:03.515
I just heard
the commotion outside.

251
00:21:04.282 --> 00:21:06.451
Hey. How'd we do?

252
00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:09.354
Good, boss.
Better than most nights.

253
00:21:09.387 --> 00:21:11.021
Yeah?

254
00:21:11.054 --> 00:21:13.324
And it's all here?

255
00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:14.459
No skimming.

256
00:21:14.492 --> 00:21:16.194
- Mm.
- No, sir.

257
00:21:16.227 --> 00:21:18.095
Here's what I want you to do.

258
00:21:19.564 --> 00:21:22.734
I want you to find us a couple
of bruisers for next week.

259
00:21:22.767 --> 00:21:24.968
- All right? Keep it coming.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:27.070
And here, put this
in the till.

261
00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:28.273
Yes, sir.

262
00:21:28.306 --> 00:21:30.375
No skimming.

263
00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:33.110
You did good, Ford.

264
00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:37.047
I ought to give
you more free booze.

265
00:21:38.616 --> 00:21:41.486
Now, don't let
Jericho here fool you.

266
00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:43.521
He's just spent a little
too much time in the sand

267
00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:45.223
with the snakes,

268
00:21:45.256 --> 00:21:48.626
and he's forgotten how to treat
a respectable woman.

269
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.529
- Says who?
- Says me.

270
00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:53.731
Now, um...

271
00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:55.400
You.

272
00:21:56.668 --> 00:21:58.770
I don't seem
to remember you around,

273
00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:02.005
and I know pretty much
every face in town.

274
00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:05.777
Yours is not a face
I'd forget.

275
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.045
My name's Annabelle Angel, sir.

276
00:22:08.078 --> 00:22:10.215
Ah. The reporter lady.

277
00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:11.516
That's correct.

278
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:14.051
Mm-hm. Yeah,
Ebb told me about you.

279
00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:16.287
Said, uh...

280
00:22:16.321 --> 00:22:18.189
...he says some fair-haired
light-skinned woman

281
00:22:18.223 --> 00:22:21.493
might come in here with a set
of legs and ask for stories.

282
00:22:23.428 --> 00:22:25.730
Is that what you're doing?
Looking for stories?

283
00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:27.565
What can I get you?

284
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:30.368
You want some water
or tea or milk?

285
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:31.569
Whiskey.

286
00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:36.139
Whiskey it is.

287
00:22:36.174 --> 00:22:37.575
Forgive me if I am mistaken,

288
00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:39.644
but you're who this
establishment belongs?

289
00:22:41.546 --> 00:22:43.715
Well, that's an interesting way
to put it, but...

290
00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:47.752
I am who this
establishment belongs.

291
00:22:47.785 --> 00:22:49.354
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:22:49.387 --> 00:22:51.422
The name's
Albert Longfellow.

293
00:22:51.456 --> 00:22:54.759
This is indeed my spot,
and you can call me Al.

294
00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:00.265
Please, Mr. Longfellow,
join me for another.

295
00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:05.370
Certainly. Yes, ma'am.

296
00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:09.173
So how long you been here?

297
00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:11.409
Oh, since the beginning.

298
00:23:11.442 --> 00:23:13.244
Since the beginning.

299
00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.847
The beginning of time.

300
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.517
Since Eve gave Adam
the apple.

301
00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:24.589
You know, it wasn't long after
that that the Army moved in,

302
00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:28.058
and then they started poking
their nose around these parts.

303
00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:30.261
You're a reporter lady.

304
00:23:30.295 --> 00:23:32.062
You might maybe
look into that.

305
00:23:36.668 --> 00:23:38.101
Cheers.

306
00:23:38.135 --> 00:23:39.771
Well, what are we cheersin'?

307
00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:42.307
To you being my first
friend in this place.

308
00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:46.878
So...

309
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:49.514
Annabelle Angel.

310
00:23:50.548 --> 00:23:51.883
Is that a pseudonym?

311
00:23:51.916 --> 00:23:53.651
No.

312
00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:56.354
So, what kind of paper
would bring you around here,

313
00:23:56.387 --> 00:23:58.556
check out us forgotten souls

314
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.224
here in the
most desolate part

315
00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:02.560
of the new
United States of America?

316
00:24:02.594 --> 00:24:04.896
- <i>San Francisco Examiner.</i>
- Oh.

317
00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:07.165
George Hearst's Publication?

318
00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:10.468
You know your press.

319
00:24:10.501 --> 00:24:14.137
They sent a lady reporter?

320
00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:15.773
They actually weren't
going to send anybody.

321
00:24:15.807 --> 00:24:17.542
I volunteered.

322
00:24:18.343 --> 00:24:19.577
Ah.

323
00:24:20.812 --> 00:24:23.848
That's the fifth hand
in a row, Pike.

324
00:24:23.881 --> 00:24:27.518
Ain't nobody that goddamn lucky.

325
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:35.727
No need for all
the commotion, boys.

326
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.563
Everybody here, just let's
have an honest game

327
00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:40.632
and a nice stiff drink.

328
00:24:40.665 --> 00:24:42.834
I'm sure Al would appreciate it
if you took this outside

329
00:24:42.867 --> 00:24:44.869
before it escalates
any further.

330
00:24:46.804 --> 00:24:48.706
Fewer words, Buck.

331
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.409
What are you implying?

332
00:24:51.442 --> 00:24:55.813
I'm calling you a two-bit
hack of a gambler

333
00:24:55.847 --> 00:24:57.915
who cheats at cards.

334
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:06.391
Now, then...

335
00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:10.561
What do you suggest we do?

336
00:25:12.363 --> 00:25:14.565
I assume you have
some sort of plan,

337
00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:16.868
being that you're
calling me a cheat.

338
00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:19.604
Or am I wrong,

339
00:25:19.637 --> 00:25:21.439
and you are just a man
with loose lips

340
00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:23.841
who cannot hold
their liquor?

341
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:27.512
You are really a scurvy bastard,
ain't you, Pike?

342
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.850
What kind of a name
is Oslo Pike anyway?

343
00:25:33.551 --> 00:25:35.553
Jesus. Al!

344
00:25:35.586 --> 00:25:38.890
I don't believe this is
any of your concern, woman.

345
00:25:38.923 --> 00:25:40.658
Hey!

346
00:25:42.827 --> 00:25:45.430
Y'all know the rules, boys.

347
00:25:45.463 --> 00:25:48.533
That sign ain't up
there for decoration.

348
00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.808
Well, would you
like me to walk him

349
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.343
all the way to the river
before I shoot him there?

350
00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:02.747
Would that make it
so your night

351
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.949
is no more interrupted,
Christine?

352
00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:06.617
You ain't shooting nobody.

353
00:26:13.458 --> 00:26:15.793
"Dost thou seal our souls
to heaven or hell?"

354
00:26:15.827 --> 00:26:17.895
asked the reaper.

355
00:26:18.763 --> 00:26:20.698
"To hell," responds God.

356
00:26:20.732 --> 00:26:24.469
And hell was filled with
a thousand screaming voices.

357
00:26:28.372 --> 00:26:29.874
You're quite the poet.

358
00:26:31.342 --> 00:26:32.910
I think you've done
enough here tonight.

359
00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:35.546
You can just take
your money and go.

360
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:47.692
Now, you saw that.
They drew first.

361
00:26:49.427 --> 00:26:51.529
I'd consider that justified.

362
00:26:51.562 --> 00:26:53.664
Wouldn't you, Al?

363
00:26:55.466 --> 00:26:57.401
For the mess.

364
00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:02.774
Hello, Ford.

365
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:05.510
Heard you were
scrapping outside.

366
00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:06.911
How'd that turn out for you?

367
00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:10.414
Well, I'm still here,
ain't I?

368
00:27:10.448 --> 00:27:12.650
No bite marks
or bullet holes.

369
00:27:12.683 --> 00:27:14.585
Yeah. Yet.

370
00:27:17.688 --> 00:27:19.590
Well, uh...

371
00:27:19.624 --> 00:27:21.692
what are you
carrying there?

372
00:27:24.095 --> 00:27:26.798
Oh, I got $5 says I could put
all six rounds in you

373
00:27:26.831 --> 00:27:29.467
before you can even pull that
out of your holster.

374
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.670
Want to make a wager?

375
00:27:32.703 --> 00:27:36.107
Gee, that sounds like
an awfully good time, but, uh,

376
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.477
I'm gonna have to decline
your generous offer.

377
00:27:40.611 --> 00:27:42.413
Too much of a yellow belly, huh?

378
00:27:42.446 --> 00:27:43.981
Ha.

379
00:27:44.015 --> 00:27:46.017
You know, I'd call it...

380
00:27:47.451 --> 00:27:50.488
smart, tired and drunk.

381
00:27:52.023 --> 00:27:55.459
And I can only assume that you'd
want me at my best, Pike.

382
00:27:56.427 --> 00:27:58.329
Or would I be mistaken?

383
00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:01.599
All right.

384
00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:04.602
You've had your pound
of flesh for the night, Oslo.

385
00:28:06.137 --> 00:28:08.840
And my hospitality for you
has run out for the night,

386
00:28:08.873 --> 00:28:13.544
so why don't you go
slither away?

387
00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:20.585
You're the boss, Al.

388
00:28:24.922 --> 00:28:26.724
Be seeing you, Ford.

389
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.706
Sometimes you need
two shotguns.

390
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:20.077
Well, well, well.
What we got here, boy?

391
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.714
Good morning.

392
00:29:23.748 --> 00:29:25.816
And good morning to you too.

393
00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:29.553
What's a pretty little
thing like you

394
00:29:29.587 --> 00:29:33.057
doing all the way out here
by yourself, Miss...?

395
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.061
Angel.

396
00:29:37.094 --> 00:29:39.130
Annabelle Angel.

397
00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:41.732
I was just taking
a walk, is all.

398
00:29:41.766 --> 00:29:43.634
Trying to find
the river, actually.

399
00:29:47.172 --> 00:29:49.106
Is that so? Angel?

400
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.709
That's a last name,
ain't it?

401
00:29:51.742 --> 00:29:53.678
Well, the riverbed's
just over yonder there.

402
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:56.480
Kind of dry this
time of season, though.

403
00:29:58.183 --> 00:30:00.818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

404
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:01.953
I'll be on my way.

405
00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:06.023
What's you in
such a hurry for?

406
00:30:06.057 --> 00:30:09.493
I'm writing this story
for the newspaper.

407
00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:11.095
Story?

408
00:30:11.128 --> 00:30:14.031
On how well the Army's doing
to keep this place safe.

409
00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:17.034
We are doing a good job,
ain't we, boys?

410
00:30:17.068 --> 00:30:19.070
- We are.
- For sure.

411
00:30:19.103 --> 00:30:23.908
You know, it's nice to be
rewarded every once in a while.

412
00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:28.913
You know, for providing
our services.

413
00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:30.915
Wouldn't you agree?

414
00:30:32.049 --> 00:30:33.651
I'm sure you could find
plenty of reward

415
00:30:33.684 --> 00:30:35.287
in this place
you call a town.

416
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.024
Gets a little boring,
seeing the same faces

417
00:30:40.057 --> 00:30:43.794
over and over
and over again.

418
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:47.232
You know, I asked
the good Lord...

419
00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:49.100
I did, I asked him.

420
00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:52.636
...if he would send me a real
little angel, just like you.

421
00:30:54.572 --> 00:30:56.574
Fair to say you think my prayers
have been answered?

422
00:30:56.607 --> 00:30:58.142
Come on over here, darling.

423
00:30:58.176 --> 00:31:00.644
It's all right, darling.

424
00:31:05.816 --> 00:31:07.852
Lower that damn gun and we'll be
gentle with you now.

425
00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:09.920
Get back! Get back!

426
00:31:09.954 --> 00:31:11.756
Get back, I said.

427
00:31:12.957 --> 00:31:14.658
Look at you.

428
00:31:14.692 --> 00:31:17.695
By the looks of it,
you trembling with that gun.

429
00:31:17.728 --> 00:31:20.298
You ain't never shot a gun
a day in your life.

430
00:31:20.332 --> 00:31:22.133
Ain't that right?

431
00:31:22.167 --> 00:31:25.569
Oh, Jesus!
She shot me in the ear!

432
00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:29.707
Does anybody else not want
to listen to a lady?

433
00:31:36.348 --> 00:31:39.116
Whichever way this ends,
you die today.

434
00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:47.691
Are you boys lost?

435
00:31:50.228 --> 00:31:52.863
Can't you tell you interrupting
something here, mister?

436
00:31:52.897 --> 00:31:54.232
Mr. Ford, thank God.

437
00:31:56.067 --> 00:31:58.069
Stay back.

438
00:31:58.102 --> 00:32:00.004
Drop the gun.

439
00:32:03.408 --> 00:32:06.744
I'm gonna take the girl
and we're gonna be on our way.

440
00:32:06.777 --> 00:32:08.979
Go on, keep moving.

441
00:32:11.216 --> 00:32:13.150
I got a tickle telling me

442
00:32:13.185 --> 00:32:15.153
I'm gonna smoke
your friend here.

443
00:32:15.187 --> 00:32:16.887
And I'm gonna take
your ear with me.

444
00:32:16.921 --> 00:32:19.357
Look, there's no need
for violence here.

445
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:23.060
Let the lady go and we'll all
be the better for it.

446
00:32:23.094 --> 00:32:25.896
You ain't in no position
to be giving me orders.

447
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.200
It wasn't an order.
It was a suggestion.

448
00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:30.701
Well, what's the damn
difference, then?

449
00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:34.138
Well, if it was an order,
it would sound like this.

450
00:32:34.172 --> 00:32:37.641
Let the girl go and you can walk
out of here alive.

451
00:32:45.015 --> 00:32:46.784
You're him.

452
00:32:48.018 --> 00:32:49.954
He's on the captain's wall.

453
00:32:49.987 --> 00:32:52.123
Well, then what the hell
are y'all waiting for?

454
00:32:59.964 --> 00:33:02.766
Stay there. Stay there.

455
00:33:04.902 --> 00:33:06.171
Stay back, goddamn it.

456
00:33:06.204 --> 00:33:09.006
I'll cut her from one ear
to the other.

457
00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:10.641
I swear, I will.

458
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:14.346
Then I'm gonna
ask you again.

459
00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:17.349
Please, let the nice woman go.

460
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:19.984
If I let her go,

461
00:33:20.017 --> 00:33:21.419
you're gonna kill me.

462
00:33:21.453 --> 00:33:24.121
And if you's really
on the captain's wall,

463
00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:28.260
that makes you a murderer,
you no-good...

464
00:33:34.064 --> 00:33:35.933
Mr. Ford.

465
00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:54.084
Oh, the wanderer awakes.

466
00:33:54.118 --> 00:33:57.389
You are safe here.
No harm will come to you.

467
00:33:57.422 --> 00:33:59.857
Good thing we came along
when we did.

468
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:04.728
The White soldiers care not
for anything here.

469
00:34:07.165 --> 00:34:09.434
You were the one
firing at the soldiers.

470
00:34:11.503 --> 00:34:13.305
Thank you.

471
00:34:13.338 --> 00:34:15.839
Thanks are no good here.

472
00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:19.211
Anybody who values life
and has compassion

473
00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:21.446
would've done
the same thing.

474
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.383
I'm not sure I believe that.

475
00:34:25.417 --> 00:34:30.821
Why does a White woman walk
alone in a place such as this?

476
00:34:30.854 --> 00:34:33.291
Well, I was looking
for the river.

477
00:34:33.325 --> 00:34:35.393
The river runs dry.

478
00:34:36.228 --> 00:34:37.795
So I was told.

479
00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:40.498
Where is Mr. Ford?

480
00:34:40.532 --> 00:34:44.436
He's outside indulging himself
in some fire water.

481
00:34:48.939 --> 00:34:50.242
Morning.

482
00:34:51.842 --> 00:34:54.945
What the hell
are you still doing here?

483
00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:57.382
Thought you'd be on your way
back to the Junction by now.

484
00:34:57.415 --> 00:34:59.517
This ain't no place
for you out here, lady.

485
00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:03.120
Well, I do want
to say thank you.

486
00:35:06.358 --> 00:35:08.393
What?

487
00:35:09.827 --> 00:35:11.396
You both live here?

488
00:35:11.429 --> 00:35:14.432
Yes, this White buffalo
and I share company together

489
00:35:14.466 --> 00:35:17.302
when he's not living
in the bottom of a bottle.

490
00:35:17.335 --> 00:35:19.170
Who are you calling
a White buffalo?

491
00:35:20.305 --> 00:35:23.441
Well, now that
you've met Wasco here

492
00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:26.211
and he's seen you to wake,
you can be on your way now.

493
00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:28.946
Leave us to our rather
simple life.

494
00:35:28.979 --> 00:35:31.915
Hosting company
is not a strength of yours.

495
00:35:32.983 --> 00:35:35.453
Well, I like
my peace and quiet.

496
00:35:35.487 --> 00:35:37.322
Mr. Ford, if it's okay,

497
00:35:37.355 --> 00:35:39.890
I'd love to ask you
a few questions.

498
00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:41.459
For what?

499
00:35:41.493 --> 00:35:44.362
Oh, that fancy article
you're writing, huh?

500
00:35:44.396 --> 00:35:47.465
The one where you paint us out
to be all murderous thieves

501
00:35:47.499 --> 00:35:49.900
living in caves,
slaughtering women and children?

502
00:35:51.902 --> 00:35:55.005
That's a lot of assumptions
as to what I might write.

503
00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:57.342
I've seen quite the opposite,
have I not?

504
00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:59.877
He will answer questions.

505
00:36:03.415 --> 00:36:05.883
I swear,
if we weren't friends...

506
00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:13.924
Then you'd have been dead
a long time ago.

507
00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:17.295
Come, sit by the fire.

508
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:21.031
Warm we must keep,
for the snow will be here soon.

509
00:36:21.065 --> 00:36:24.034
Fire, fire, fire.
Fire makes the world go around.

510
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:26.904
White man made fire,
you know.

511
00:36:30.241 --> 00:36:31.975
He did not.

512
00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:56.934
Captain?

513
00:36:56.967 --> 00:36:58.603
What is it?

514
00:37:08.546 --> 00:37:10.315
We, uh...

515
00:37:12.149 --> 00:37:13.585
Spit it out.

516
00:37:14.985 --> 00:37:16.354
What happened, Private?

517
00:37:18.021 --> 00:37:20.124
We was ambushed, sir.

518
00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:23.428
Ambushed?

519
00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:26.331
Ambushed by who?

520
00:37:26.364 --> 00:37:28.600
Speak, son,
and be detailed.

521
00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:33.171
We was escorting that reporter
lady through the Junction,

522
00:37:33.204 --> 00:37:36.006
down by the barn...

523
00:37:36.674 --> 00:37:40.110
and a man jumped us.

524
00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:42.547
And how many of you
were there?

525
00:37:44.416 --> 00:37:46.384
Three, sir.

526
00:37:46.418 --> 00:37:49.987
So one man took on three
military-trained individuals

527
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.656
and came out the victor?

528
00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:55.260
No, sir.

529
00:37:55.293 --> 00:37:57.162
I'm certain
that he had help.

530
00:37:57.195 --> 00:38:00.398
Rifle fire came
from somewhere else.

531
00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:04.101
So two men
did this, then?

532
00:38:05.236 --> 00:38:07.037
That'd be my guess, sir.

533
00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:09.607
Well, what about the girl?

534
00:38:13.244 --> 00:38:14.579
They, uh...

535
00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:16.681
They absconded with her, sir.

536
00:38:16.714 --> 00:38:19.317
Stay away from
big words, Private.

537
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.118
They don't agree with you.

538
00:38:21.151 --> 00:38:24.054
Did you get a look
at these men?

539
00:38:24.456 --> 00:38:26.191
One.

540
00:38:26.224 --> 00:38:29.694
I got a real good
up-close look at one, sir.

541
00:38:31.362 --> 00:38:33.130
And what did he look like?

542
00:38:36.568 --> 00:38:38.303
It was him.

543
00:38:49.112 --> 00:38:50.682
This man?

544
00:38:58.756 --> 00:39:02.293
Muster an escort for me.
I'm going to Apache Junction.

545
00:39:04.462 --> 00:39:06.531
- Sir.
- What is it?

546
00:39:08.833 --> 00:39:11.202
He killed your boy, sir.

547
00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:18.576
John's dead?

548
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.579
Yes, sir.

549
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.482
Sorry, sir.

550
00:39:28.553 --> 00:39:31.021
Boy never was
too bright anyway.

551
00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:34.192
Go on.

552
00:39:43.368 --> 00:39:45.102
But he was a soldier.

553
00:39:46.504 --> 00:39:49.340
And justice will roll
like a river,

554
00:39:49.374 --> 00:39:52.610
righteousness like
a never-ending stream.

555
00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:08.192
How'd you both find this place?
How'd you come to meet?

556
00:40:08.226 --> 00:40:10.461
One question at a time, lady.

557
00:40:11.496 --> 00:40:14.465
I was born here,
me and my people.

558
00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:16.167
And where are they now?

559
00:40:22.874 --> 00:40:24.642
I came out
from the plains.

560
00:40:24.676 --> 00:40:27.478
Drove cattle out there
for a while until the war hit.

561
00:40:27.512 --> 00:40:29.280
And then?

562
00:40:30.782 --> 00:40:33.384
You're just a mighty bit nosy,
ain't you?

563
00:40:33.418 --> 00:40:35.587
That's my job.

564
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.323
Well, I'd be looking for
a more respectable occupation,

565
00:40:38.356 --> 00:40:39.724
if you ask me.

566
00:40:39.757 --> 00:40:41.225
Says the outlaw.

567
00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:42.794
Who said I'm a wanted man?

568
00:40:42.827 --> 00:40:45.229
Alas, what would
a respectable occupation be

569
00:40:45.263 --> 00:40:47.198
for me anyways,
Mr. Ford?

570
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:49.867
Gander a guess
that you come here

571
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:52.537
because you've done
something awful bad.

572
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.441
Unlike your compatriot Wasco,
who was born in this land,

573
00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:57.875
you had to migrate here.

574
00:40:57.909 --> 00:40:59.644
And from my understanding,

575
00:40:59.677 --> 00:41:01.646
the men that learned
to call this place home are...

576
00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:03.781
Murderers and thieves.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

577
00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:05.283
Like I said, lady,

578
00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:06.784
you is nosy,
and exactly why no one

579
00:41:06.818 --> 00:41:09.520
respects a person
of your occupation.

580
00:41:09.554 --> 00:41:11.522
Jericho came out west

581
00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:14.492
because he did not want
to fight the great war.

582
00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:17.595
So you left
before it started?

583
00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:20.298
Well, it didn't make sense

584
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:22.800
to go fighting
other people's battles.

585
00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:27.238
The White man's drink
does funny things to the mind.

586
00:41:27.271 --> 00:41:29.173
All right, that's enough.

587
00:41:29.207 --> 00:41:31.209
No, it's important
that she knows

588
00:41:31.242 --> 00:41:33.478
how this relationship
was forged.

589
00:41:34.746 --> 00:41:36.547
Jericho took a bad fall
hunting one day.

590
00:41:36.581 --> 00:41:41.352
Me and my people took him in,
saw that he was healed.

591
00:41:42.387 --> 00:41:43.755
The Army offered a reward

592
00:41:43.788 --> 00:41:46.224
for any Indian brought in,
dead or alive.

593
00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:52.497
You know, I know I got a bottle
around here somewhere.

594
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.633
Army men arrived one day.
Began to do what they do best.

595
00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:58.236
I know I have a
bottle around here somewhere.

596
00:42:01.639 --> 00:42:03.241
Murder.

597
00:42:03.274 --> 00:42:05.576
Jericho decided
to respond back with lead.

598
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.579
And that was
the end of the story.

599
00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:12.517
These lands
have seen enough bloodshed

600
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.253
to last a lifetime,
Miss Annabelle.

601
00:42:15.286 --> 00:42:17.755
It's never in our
best interest to spill more.

602
00:42:19.357 --> 00:42:21.659
We all have a history
that brought us here.

603
00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:23.428
But like my people before,

604
00:42:23.461 --> 00:42:25.997
we've all been written
to be the devil

605
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.499
in a land that's
not theirs to give.

606
00:42:40.812 --> 00:42:42.547
Well...

607
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.348
would appear to be quite
the party, then.

608
00:42:44.382 --> 00:42:46.451
Mary what the hell are you doing
out here all by yourself?

609
00:42:46.484 --> 00:42:49.587
I am a grown woman.
I think I can handle myself.

610
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.989
Oh, yeah, that's what this one
thought earlier today,

611
00:42:52.023 --> 00:42:54.826
till Hensley's troops tried
to raise her skirt.

612
00:42:56.461 --> 00:42:57.695
Are you okay, darling?

613
00:42:57.729 --> 00:42:59.263
They didn't hurt you,
did they?

614
00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:00.932
No, they didn't...

615
00:43:00.965 --> 00:43:03.968
thanks to Mr. Ford
and Mr. Wasco here.

616
00:43:05.536 --> 00:43:06.871
What happened?

617
00:43:12.343 --> 00:43:14.612
Well, I might've had
to shoot one of them.

618
00:43:14.645 --> 00:43:16.581
Three.

619
00:43:17.882 --> 00:43:19.417
Three?

620
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.886
Yeah, that does sound
more accurate.

621
00:43:21.919 --> 00:43:25.289
Those military boys
will be up in arms, Jericho.

622
00:43:25.323 --> 00:43:26.924
You know it as well
as anyone.

623
00:43:28.793 --> 00:43:30.895
I'm afraid we haven't
had the chance to meet yet.

624
00:43:30.928 --> 00:43:33.965
Yeah, this here
is the newspaper lady.

625
00:43:33.998 --> 00:43:35.466
Annabelle Angel.

626
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.768
Mary...

627
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:38.436
Primm.

628
00:43:40.037 --> 00:43:42.940
I brought some
fresh vegetables...

629
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:45.877
and something to drink.

630
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.879
Yes.

631
00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:50.982
Mwah! Sweet Jesus.

632
00:43:52.416 --> 00:43:53.951
Good.

633
00:43:55.753 --> 00:43:57.355
What about you, Annabelle?

634
00:43:57.388 --> 00:43:59.690
- What you like?
- Some bread, please.

635
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:02.994
- I got you covered.
- Thank you.

636
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:08.533
It's horrible, you know?

637
00:44:08.566 --> 00:44:11.002
All those women and children,
just defenseless.

638
00:44:11.035 --> 00:44:13.070
Slaughtered in
the middle of the night.

639
00:44:13.104 --> 00:44:14.906
No badge could help that.

640
00:44:14.939 --> 00:44:17.408
They'd have needed
their own army.

641
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:19.677
I guess you can't change
the past, now can you?

642
00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:27.819
Evening, Al.

643
00:44:31.122 --> 00:44:32.790
Captain.

644
00:44:36.994 --> 00:44:39.664
What the hell did we do for him
to grace us with his presence?

645
00:44:40.932 --> 00:44:43.067
Should I fetch the scattergun,
Miss Williams?

646
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.370
No, Al's got it behind the bar.
Just go about your business.

647
00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:53.477
Place looks good.
Business looks better.

648
00:44:53.511 --> 00:44:56.414
What the hell
are you doing here?

649
00:44:57.548 --> 00:44:59.817
Is that any way
to greet an old friend?

650
00:45:00.252 --> 00:45:02.019
We got rules.

651
00:45:02.053 --> 00:45:03.688
You're breaking them.

652
00:45:05.022 --> 00:45:06.958
Oh, yeah.

653
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:10.695
We don't come looking for wanted
men here at the Junction,

654
00:45:10.728 --> 00:45:15.666
and our outpost continues
to receive goods and services.

655
00:45:16.834 --> 00:45:18.502
An honorable agreement.

656
00:45:18.536 --> 00:45:22.907
Yet, beyond counterproductive
to my work, Al.

657
00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.142
It's kept you fed.

658
00:45:25.177 --> 00:45:26.911
Kept you clothed.

659
00:45:26.944 --> 00:45:30.481
You hear to balk
at that agreement?

660
00:45:30.514 --> 00:45:33.618
Miss Williams,
the mouth that never closes.

661
00:45:34.685 --> 00:45:36.721
Don't you have
a brothel to run?

662
00:45:36.754 --> 00:45:39.056
You don't have a dog
in this fight.

663
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.858
Well, it's worked so far,

664
00:45:40.892 --> 00:45:43.394
so I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

665
00:45:44.229 --> 00:45:45.830
What are you doing here?

666
00:45:45.863 --> 00:45:47.765
Well, it appears...

667
00:45:47.798 --> 00:45:50.468
And, of course,
I'm just guessing here.

668
00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:52.204
That one of your customers

669
00:45:52.237 --> 00:45:55.072
dispatched some of
my soldiers this morning.

670
00:45:55.907 --> 00:45:58.809
Well, that's unfortunate.

671
00:45:58.843 --> 00:46:03.681
However, it did not happen
within the confines of my walls,

672
00:46:03.714 --> 00:46:05.783
so it doesn't make it
my problem, does it?

673
00:46:06.918 --> 00:46:08.786
So I'm guessing
it's out of the question

674
00:46:08.819 --> 00:46:11.156
to ask you if
you've seen this man.

675
00:46:11.956 --> 00:46:13.457
Out of the question.

676
00:46:13.491 --> 00:46:15.993
- Out of the question.
- Christine...

677
00:46:16.027 --> 00:46:17.995
let me to my business.

678
00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:20.765
Al, if I wanted to,
I could gather all the men

679
00:46:20.798 --> 00:46:23.668
at my disposal and march them in
this shitty little town of yours

680
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:25.036
and burn it to the ground.

681
00:46:26.637 --> 00:46:27.838
Meat and grain and women,

682
00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:30.175
all those things
are replaceable.

683
00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:32.576
So all these many years
that I've let you

684
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.078
keep these walls standing

685
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:36.514
and keep me from the one step

686
00:46:36.547 --> 00:46:37.982
that I need to make
to completely

687
00:46:38.015 --> 00:46:41.186
obliterate the lawlessness
in this territory,

688
00:46:41.219 --> 00:46:43.688
I'm asking you to do
one thing for me now.

689
00:46:43.721 --> 00:46:47.058
You tell me the next time
you see this man.

690
00:46:48.193 --> 00:46:49.827
And for the rest of you...

691
00:46:51.163 --> 00:46:52.697
I know there's many men in here

692
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.232
that I'd love
to show the noose

693
00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:57.501
and see them ride the pine
straight to the devil.

694
00:46:57.535 --> 00:47:00.071
But I lost soldiers today,

695
00:47:00.104 --> 00:47:03.275
and an innocent civilian
in the form of that reporter

696
00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:05.910
from San Francisco
got kidnapped.

697
00:47:07.144 --> 00:47:11.283
So I'm offering a bonus
of up to $200

698
00:47:11.316 --> 00:47:15.119
for the man or men
that bring me Jericho Ford.

699
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.756
I want him dead or alive.

700
00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:20.891
Dead would be preferable.

701
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.695
What about that girl
you were talking about?

702
00:47:24.729 --> 00:47:27.732
Extra $50 if you find her.

703
00:47:27.765 --> 00:47:31.569
If not, I'll consider
her a casualty of war.

704
00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:37.141
It's been fun, Al.

705
00:47:37.175 --> 00:47:39.910
I know I'll be hearing
from you very soon.

706
00:47:40.345 --> 00:47:41.679
Let's go.

707
00:47:47.018 --> 00:47:49.720
No way Ford done
what he said, Al.

708
00:47:49.754 --> 00:47:51.922
He's not that kind of man.
You know it, I know it.

709
00:47:51.956 --> 00:47:54.091
Yeah? Are you sure
about that, Christine?

710
00:47:56.027 --> 00:48:01.032
With all the trash and hooligans
running around this town?

711
00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:05.203
I know a good man
when I see him.

712
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:08.039
You certainly do.

713
00:48:09.673 --> 00:48:12.610
I'll tell what's more
important than innocence.

714
00:48:12.643 --> 00:48:14.845
Survival.

715
00:48:14.879 --> 00:48:16.914
- Hmm.
- The way I look at it,

716
00:48:16.947 --> 00:48:20.017
we got a lot more outlaws than
Army boys around these parts.

717
00:48:21.286 --> 00:48:22.853
So if you're
starting to think

718
00:48:22.887 --> 00:48:24.922
that you might want
to turn Ford in, well...

719
00:48:26.358 --> 00:48:28.260
You don't think these hooligans
might start thinking

720
00:48:28.293 --> 00:48:30.628
the honorable Al Longfellow
might do the same thing to them

721
00:48:30.661 --> 00:48:32.797
if the opportunity
presented itself?

722
00:48:36.934 --> 00:48:40.004
If it was me, I'd start
sleeping with one eye open

723
00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:41.806
and my hand clutched
around my pistol,

724
00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.841
if I was gonna
head down that road.

725
00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:47.645
You're a smart woman.

726
00:48:47.678 --> 00:48:50.014
Hmm. That I am.

727
00:49:11.135 --> 00:49:13.003
Thank you.

728
00:49:17.342 --> 00:49:20.044
It's different, right?

729
00:49:21.712 --> 00:49:23.281
What's that?

730
00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:26.150
It's different from what you
thought you'd find here?

731
00:49:28.152 --> 00:49:30.654
I wasn't exactly sure
what to expect.

732
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:36.428
Society has this
place pegged as

733
00:49:36.461 --> 00:49:40.898
a ruthless land
full of criminals.

734
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:43.734
And Captain Hensley and his
agenda clearing out the rabble

735
00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:48.105
to make way for
a proper civilization.

736
00:49:48.139 --> 00:49:50.674
At least, I am assuming
that is how the rest

737
00:49:50.708 --> 00:49:52.676
of our newfound
United States

738
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:54.111
views our little corner
of the world

739
00:49:54.145 --> 00:49:56.147
that we've carved out
for ourselves.

740
00:49:57.748 --> 00:50:00.218
They never had a chance
to think any different.

741
00:50:02.487 --> 00:50:04.389
You can be that chance.

742
00:50:08.293 --> 00:50:11.128
There are people here that are
just trying to live their lives.

743
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.734
They like having
a small piece of earth

744
00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:18.903
where they aren't
judged every day.

745
00:50:19.904 --> 00:50:21.239
We all may be misfits,

746
00:50:21.273 --> 00:50:24.476
but it helps it go
down a bit smoother,

747
00:50:24.509 --> 00:50:26.444
you know, when society
ain't inflicting its view

748
00:50:26.478 --> 00:50:28.313
of law and order upon us.

749
00:50:31.449 --> 00:50:33.918
What about the ones
that actually have done

750
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.154
the unspeakable
in their past?

751
00:50:36.188 --> 00:50:39.123
How does one justify
the continued freedom

752
00:50:39.157 --> 00:50:41.825
to the loved ones who have
had someone or something

753
00:50:41.859 --> 00:50:43.694
taken from them?

754
00:50:44.496 --> 00:50:46.364
Honey...

755
00:50:46.398 --> 00:50:50.968
I have learned that bad people
get what they deserve

756
00:50:51.001 --> 00:50:52.970
in some form or another.

757
00:50:54.539 --> 00:50:57.141
Whether that be now
or ten years from now,

758
00:50:57.175 --> 00:51:00.077
Lord and the devil alike
see that justice be done.

759
00:51:01.279 --> 00:51:03.747
You can't let bad people
go unpunished.

760
00:51:03.781 --> 00:51:06.484
There has to be some sort
of law and order, Mary.

761
00:51:07.519 --> 00:51:09.820
Yeah, I suppose there does.

762
00:51:14.226 --> 00:51:15.826
Don't let
the view fool you.

763
00:51:15.859 --> 00:51:18.463
This place has
its disadvantages.

764
00:51:20.831 --> 00:51:22.800
Like what, exactly?

765
00:51:25.303 --> 00:51:27.272
Look at me, Annabelle.

766
00:51:28.806 --> 00:51:30.342
I'm a whore.

767
00:51:32.177 --> 00:51:35.180
As long as I stay here,
I'll always be a whore.

768
00:51:36.348 --> 00:51:38.849
But that's your decision,
is it not?

769
00:51:38.882 --> 00:51:41.852
There's nothing else here.
Not for women.

770
00:51:41.885 --> 00:51:44.356
I'm not sure I believe
that to be true.

771
00:51:45.089 --> 00:51:46.890
You've seen it.

772
00:51:46.924 --> 00:51:48.393
The looks you get.

773
00:51:48.426 --> 00:51:52.129
No one can believe
someone like you is here.

774
00:51:53.565 --> 00:51:57.502
They haven't seen a woman
with freedom of expression.

775
00:52:00.538 --> 00:52:02.207
You could leave.

776
00:52:04.509 --> 00:52:06.076
Not without him.

777
00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:12.116
You love him?

778
00:52:13.184 --> 00:52:15.152
I think I do.

779
00:52:15.186 --> 00:52:17.921
I'm gonna put
that in my story.

780
00:52:17.955 --> 00:52:21.259
- What's that?
- That this place isn't lost.

781
00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:23.361
That there's warmth here.

782
00:52:23.395 --> 00:52:25.996
Kindness and love exist.

783
00:52:30.602 --> 00:52:32.404
Have you told him yet?

784
00:52:32.437 --> 00:52:33.837
No.

785
00:52:36.508 --> 00:52:38.310
Why not?

786
00:52:41.579 --> 00:52:43.348
A man like Jericho Ford
doesn't want to spend

787
00:52:43.381 --> 00:52:46.451
the rest of his life
with a whore.

788
00:52:46.484 --> 00:52:49.920
Well, my observations tell
quite a different story, Mary.

789
00:53:03.401 --> 00:53:05.270
I'll be back tomorrow.

790
00:53:07.505 --> 00:53:09.374
Don't burn the camp down
while I'm away.

791
00:53:09.407 --> 00:53:11.875
Stay away from the drink,
my friend.

792
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:13.904
It's okay.
You're okay.

793
00:54:16.106 --> 00:54:17.908
You're okay.

794
00:54:24.716 --> 00:54:26.551
Goodbye, Mary.

795
00:54:26.584 --> 00:54:29.287
Oh, I'm sure I'll be seeing
you soon enough, Annabelle.

796
00:54:30.622 --> 00:54:33.425
I'm gonna walk Miss Primm
back to her residence.

797
00:54:39.197 --> 00:54:42.667
If you like, you're welcome
to follow me back when I leave.

798
00:54:46.638 --> 00:54:48.038
What?

799
00:54:48.071 --> 00:54:50.040
Wasco likes the company, is all.

800
00:54:50.073 --> 00:54:52.343
She's educated.
He likes that sort of thing.

801
00:54:52.377 --> 00:54:54.446
Gives him someone to talk to.

802
00:54:54.479 --> 00:54:56.681
I would love to,
Mr. Ford.

803
00:54:56.714 --> 00:54:58.750
I'll just grab a couple things
from my room?

804
00:54:58.783 --> 00:55:00.485
Yeah, take your time.

805
00:55:00.518 --> 00:55:03.020
I got to go to Al's
and get me a bottle or two.

806
00:55:03.053 --> 00:55:06.056
Go to the store.
Wasco needs spices.

807
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.566
Since when did you get a heart?

808
00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:17.100
Woman, I've always
had one.

809
00:55:17.134 --> 00:55:20.371
It's been sitting right here,
beating away each and every day.

810
00:55:20.405 --> 00:55:22.039
Is that so?

811
00:55:22.072 --> 00:55:23.541
That's a fact.

812
00:55:28.546 --> 00:55:31.048
You're a good man,
Jericho Ford.

813
00:55:32.684 --> 00:55:36.019
I'm a lucky girl to have
someone like you in my life.

814
00:55:38.055 --> 00:55:39.624
No, you ain't, Mary. I...

815
00:55:42.594 --> 00:55:45.363
I should be doing a hell
of a lot better by you, Mary.

816
00:55:49.434 --> 00:55:50.668
Someday.

817
00:55:50.702 --> 00:55:54.472
Someday, we'll leave
this place.

818
00:55:54.506 --> 00:55:56.541
We'll leave this place,

819
00:55:56.574 --> 00:55:58.676
and all the baggage
that comes with it.

820
00:56:00.678 --> 00:56:03.080
I guess we all got to stop
running sometime, right?

821
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:16.487
<i>The blood-soaked
lawless sands of Arizona</i>

822
00:57:16.521 --> 00:57:19.257
<i>are not what they would appear.</i>

823
00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:21.492
<i>I have found the
beginnings of friendship</i>

824
00:57:21.526 --> 00:57:23.394
<i>in a few of the residents here.</i>

825
00:57:23.428 --> 00:57:26.898
<i>Upper-class society will
condemn them as criminals,</i>

826
00:57:26.931 --> 00:57:28.900
<i>traitors, savages, even.</i>

827
00:57:28.933 --> 00:57:31.603
<i>But I have now witnessed
the blossoming buds</i>

828
00:57:31.636 --> 00:57:34.137
<i>of love and hope
in a place that before,</i>

829
00:57:34.172 --> 00:57:36.708
<i>I never would've
thought possible.</i>

830
00:57:36.741 --> 00:57:39.644
<i>This place still has many faces
that it has not yet shown,</i>

831
00:57:39.677 --> 00:57:42.614
<i>but if the hospitality
I have received so far</i>

832
00:57:42.647 --> 00:57:45.650
<i>is any indication of
this place and its people,</i>

833
00:57:45.683 --> 00:57:50.521
<i>it is not what the modern world
would have everyone believe.</i>

834
00:57:50.555 --> 00:57:52.557
<i>The only real monsters
I have encountered</i>

835
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:56.694
<i>were the ones that were put
here to protect people like me.</i>

836
00:57:56.728 --> 00:57:58.763
<i>Irony weaves a winding road.</i>

837
00:58:08.906 --> 00:58:11.542
It's a little empty
in here, ain't it?

838
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:14.379
We closed today.

839
00:58:15.747 --> 00:58:17.582
Five years I've been
coming to this joint,

840
00:58:17.615 --> 00:58:19.350
and I never seen you close.

841
00:58:22.954 --> 00:58:25.556
The Captain came
and paid us a visit.

842
00:58:28.226 --> 00:58:31.696
He said you shot
some of his boys...

843
00:58:34.532 --> 00:58:36.901
and you kidnapped
that reporter lady.

844
00:58:36.934 --> 00:58:39.604
Yeah, those boys
were gonna rape her.

845
00:58:39.637 --> 00:58:42.540
But she's here right now
in her hotel room.

846
00:58:42.573 --> 00:58:44.942
By her own free will.

847
00:58:46.477 --> 00:58:48.379
If I don't do something,

848
00:58:48.413 --> 00:58:51.549
they're gonna burn it
all down, Ford.

849
00:59:01.726 --> 00:59:04.362
I known you a long time, friend.

850
00:59:04.395 --> 00:59:07.231
And I said to myself,

851
00:59:07.265 --> 00:59:11.636
"No, I don't think Jericho
kidnapped no woman."

852
00:59:15.373 --> 00:59:18.443
But I had to give him something,
you understand?

853
00:59:21.612 --> 00:59:23.581
Not really, Al.

854
00:59:29.454 --> 00:59:31.856
I had to break
my own rules, Jericho.

855
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:44.035
That's the best
I can do for you, Ford.

856
00:59:44.068 --> 00:59:46.571
You have to shoot your own way
out of this one. Go on.

857
00:59:51.843 --> 00:59:53.411
Give 'em hell, Ford.

858
00:59:55.546 --> 00:59:56.981
For all of us.

859
01:01:41.018 --> 01:01:42.954
Sorry.

860
01:01:42.987 --> 01:01:44.488
Come on.

861
01:02:43.047 --> 01:02:44.949
All right,
I think we lost them.

862
01:02:45.883 --> 01:02:48.753
We got to get back to Wasco.

863
01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.930
Mr. Ford?

864
01:02:58.963 --> 01:03:00.731
We'll go out the back.

865
01:03:03.868 --> 01:03:05.736
I think I've been shot.

866
01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.004
No.

867
01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:11.509
Okay. It's okay,
Annabelle.

868
01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:13.110
We just need to get you
back to camp, all right?

869
01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:15.479
Wasco's gonna fix you up.
He's gonna fix you up.

870
01:03:15.513 --> 01:03:18.449
It's okay, it's okay.

871
01:03:42.974 --> 01:03:44.675
Hello, Mary.

872
01:03:52.717 --> 01:03:55.686
Wasco! Wasco!

873
01:03:56.988 --> 01:03:58.656
Wasco!

874
01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:00.691
Wasco!

875
01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:04.562
- What happened?
- They were waiting for me.

876
01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:06.864
- Who?
- The soldiers. Higgins' boys.

877
01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:09.033
They attacked you
while you were in camp?

878
01:04:09.066 --> 01:04:10.701
That's not part
of the agreement.

879
01:04:10.735 --> 01:04:12.570
There's no more agreements.

880
01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:14.239
The bullet went through.

881
01:04:14.272 --> 01:04:16.841
We'll need some clean water,
some cotton,

882
01:04:16.874 --> 01:04:18.709
either from your shirt
or from your pillow.

883
01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:20.212
I do not care which.

884
01:04:20.245 --> 01:04:21.979
Well, is she gonna be okay?
Is she gonna live?

885
01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:25.250
As long as you move quickly,
we can save her life.

886
01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:30.155
You'll be okay, my dear.
I promise you.

887
01:04:56.814 --> 01:04:58.316
Sir?

888
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:01.118
This man claims to have
information about Jericho Ford.

889
01:05:08.959 --> 01:05:11.196
Information, huh?

890
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:15.599
Oh, I never claimed
to have the information.

891
01:05:16.301 --> 01:05:19.136
What good are you to me?

892
01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:23.741
She is the one
with the information.

893
01:05:23.774 --> 01:05:27.245
I say again, what good
are you to me, then?

894
01:05:29.013 --> 01:05:33.751
I am the hilt in which the hand
holds to do its bidding, sir.

895
01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:38.390
I don't have time
for riddles.

896
01:05:38.423 --> 01:05:40.091
Speak plainly.

897
01:05:40.124 --> 01:05:43.195
I just watched Jericho
fend off an infamous gang

898
01:05:43.228 --> 01:05:45.663
known as the
Higgins Boys, now...

899
01:05:47.332 --> 01:05:49.267
I am confident
that I am the only one

900
01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:51.902
who can kill Jericho Ford.

901
01:05:53.305 --> 01:05:57.242
Otherwise, you can keep sending
your men to do the job,

902
01:05:57.275 --> 01:05:58.943
but your bill to the undertaker?

903
01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:01.346
Well, that's gonna keep
getting more expensive

904
01:06:01.379 --> 01:06:03.181
as the days wane on.

905
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:07.818
The men out there
are speaking as if this

906
01:06:07.852 --> 01:06:10.388
Ford cannot be killed.

907
01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:13.124
But I say,

908
01:06:13.158 --> 01:06:16.794
"If a man can bleed,
he can surely die."

909
01:06:17.462 --> 01:06:18.729
You.

910
01:06:18.762 --> 01:06:20.831
Who are you in all of this?

911
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.002
I'm no one.

912
01:06:25.035 --> 01:06:28.038
Well, clearly you're
somebody of importance

913
01:06:28.072 --> 01:06:29.940
in this situation.

914
01:06:31.343 --> 01:06:34.078
If I may.

915
01:06:34.111 --> 01:06:37.815
I do believe I can extract
the information out of her,

916
01:06:37.848 --> 01:06:39.783
given my methods.

917
01:06:40.918 --> 01:06:42.686
Who are you?

918
01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.259
Won't matter somewhere.

919
01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:51.128
The name's Oslo Pike.

920
01:06:51.163 --> 01:06:53.731
And what do you want
out of all this?

921
01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:55.267
The money?

922
01:06:56.168 --> 01:06:57.701
No.

923
01:06:58.736 --> 01:07:00.338
Two things
and two things only.

924
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.410
First, I want my name
free and clear.

925
01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:07.711
I believe you can do that
with a simple letter

926
01:07:07.745 --> 01:07:09.447
over to a Mr. Wells
in Nebraska,

927
01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:13.050
explaining how my
services were exemplary

928
01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:15.052
in the catching and killing

929
01:07:15.085 --> 01:07:17.121
of a notorious criminal
in these parts.

930
01:07:18.088 --> 01:07:20.057
And the second thing?

931
01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:23.328
I want the honor
of killing Jericho Ford.

932
01:07:25.062 --> 01:07:26.964
How do you plan
on doing that?

933
01:07:26.997 --> 01:07:30.335
I am faster than he is.

934
01:07:30.368 --> 01:07:32.970
You make this sound like
a dime novel, Mr. Pike.

935
01:07:33.003 --> 01:07:35.873
Oh, there have been plenty
of them written about me, sir.

936
01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:39.777
Oslo Pike.

937
01:07:41.213 --> 01:07:43.448
Bellevue, Nebraska.

938
01:07:45.283 --> 01:07:48.786
And you don't want
any of the money?

939
01:07:50.155 --> 01:07:53.425
Fame and fear will
buy you the world, Captain.

940
01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:55.793
I have tasted both,

941
01:07:55.826 --> 01:07:57.229
and clearly the
killing of Mr. Ford

942
01:07:57.262 --> 01:08:00.365
is surely gonna
bring me more, therefore,

943
01:08:00.398 --> 01:08:03.168
I do not require
your physical currency.

944
01:08:04.902 --> 01:08:07.071
You're an interesting
character, Mr. Pike.

945
01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:09.207
Do we have a deal?

946
01:08:16.414 --> 01:08:17.948
Yes.

947
01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.253
Now...

948
01:08:22.487 --> 01:08:25.022
Have you ever seen
an eyeball pop?

949
01:08:27.057 --> 01:08:29.160
It is a most
interesting sight.

950
01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:31.196
You see...

951
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:35.267
when a sharp object
punctures it,

952
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.935
it just deflates
like a balloon.

953
01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.171
Some say that there is no pain.

954
01:08:43.308 --> 01:08:45.477
You see, but the fear
is not losing the eyes.

955
01:08:47.245 --> 01:08:49.146
It's more complex.

956
01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.251
When you're plunged
into complete darkness...

957
01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.022
there's no telling
where the blade might cut next.

958
01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:03.561
Hmm.

959
01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:08.999
They say a person can
withstand a thousand cuts.

960
01:09:10.635 --> 01:09:13.070
Surely that would be painful.

961
01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:15.273
Close your eyes.

962
01:09:17.242 --> 01:09:19.843
Uh-huh. Close them.

963
01:09:20.512 --> 01:09:23.581
Go on. Close them.

964
01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:25.450
I said close them!

965
01:09:31.922 --> 01:09:34.124
Now I'm gonna give you
one chance to tell me

966
01:09:34.159 --> 01:09:36.994
where Jericho's camp is,
and if you do not,

967
01:09:37.027 --> 01:09:38.463
not only will
I take your eyes

968
01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:40.432
and shroud you
into eternal darkness,

969
01:09:40.465 --> 01:09:42.300
but I will make sure
you are so disfigured

970
01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:44.502
that even dogs will walk away
at the very sight of you.

971
01:09:48.005 --> 01:09:50.040
Open your eyes.

972
01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:53.445
You look at me.

973
01:09:57.114 --> 01:09:59.950
Where is he?

974
01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:16.934
She will live.

975
01:10:21.373 --> 01:10:26.244
I've seen that look in
your eye many times before.

976
01:10:27.479 --> 01:10:29.347
Jericho.

977
01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:31.148
Jericho, where are
you going?

978
01:10:31.182 --> 01:10:33.184
Jericho, where are you going?

979
01:10:33.218 --> 01:10:35.953
- What do you think?
- To kill someone?

980
01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.555
Is it so obvious?

981
01:10:37.589 --> 01:10:39.357
That will solve nothing.

982
01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:41.992
I don't need any
of your preaching today.

983
01:10:43.528 --> 01:10:45.230
Just let me get it done.

984
01:11:01.379 --> 01:11:04.549
You know, you start
coming into these odd

985
01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:07.385
sort of bivouac

986
01:11:08.051 --> 01:11:09.587
shantytowns.

987
01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:11.156
Sometimes you want a break.

988
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:13.324
I was gonna take a vacation.

989
01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:16.927
Take some days off
for myself.

990
01:11:17.629 --> 01:11:19.564
I got a kid at home.

991
01:11:21.633 --> 01:11:23.133
Shelby.

992
01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:29.374
A man's still
gotta make a living,

993
01:11:29.407 --> 01:11:32.477
and I am just well within
my lawful rights

994
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:35.012
to pursue the type of
living that I'm doing.

995
01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:37.315
Pour that drink, Jose.

996
01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:55.132
You know,
you took the lives...

997
01:11:57.335 --> 01:11:59.737
of a few folk who were
quite dear to me.

998
01:12:01.606 --> 01:12:03.441
Turn around.

999
01:12:03.475 --> 01:12:05.677
I don't like to shoot
a man in the back.

1000
01:12:08.446 --> 01:12:11.081
Well, I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1001
01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:36.341
Be a shame to waste it.

1002
01:13:00.298 --> 01:13:02.032
This seems familiar.

1003
01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:08.773
Is it bad?

1004
01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:11.175
You'll live to
fight another day.

1005
01:13:14.279 --> 01:13:16.581
Where's Mr. Ford?

1006
01:13:16.614 --> 01:13:19.350
Returning soon.
Try to get some rest.

1007
01:13:46.344 --> 01:13:49.714
Where are you, boy?
Come home now. Come home.

1008
01:14:56.314 --> 01:14:57.682
Ford.

1009
01:14:57.715 --> 01:14:59.283
Where is he?

1010
01:14:59.317 --> 01:15:00.885
I do not know.

1011
01:15:00.918 --> 01:15:04.889
Suppose you don't have any idea
when he'll be back, then?

1012
01:15:04.922 --> 01:15:06.591
Do you?

1013
01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:13.665
You know, I've killed
a lot of people before.

1014
01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:19.470
But I've never killed
no Injun before.

1015
01:15:20.705 --> 01:15:24.609
It's no more pleasurable
than taking any life.

1016
01:15:24.642 --> 01:15:26.944
Oh, I doubt that very much.

1017
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.315
You see,
I think your death

1018
01:15:31.349 --> 01:15:34.952
is gonna contribute
greatly to my cause.

1019
01:15:34.986 --> 01:15:39.891
Evil men live only long enough
to see their end.

1020
01:15:41.859 --> 01:15:44.595
Well, I guess we must
all die sometime.

1021
01:16:10.722 --> 01:16:13.758
You tell Ford to meet me
at the thoroughfare.

1022
01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:33.311
Wasco.

1023
01:16:33.344 --> 01:16:34.912
Annabelle.

1024
01:16:42.987 --> 01:16:44.889
I'm sorry.

1025
01:16:46.457 --> 01:16:47.992
I'm sorry.

1026
01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:56.033
I'm so sorry.

1027
01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:18.723
It ain't your fault.

1028
01:17:18.756 --> 01:17:20.591
It ain't your fault.

1029
01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:22.360
I should've been here.

1030
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.729
I should've been here.

1031
01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:40.845
It was that man.

1032
01:17:48.786 --> 01:17:50.755
Pike.

1033
01:18:07.505 --> 01:18:08.973
Jericho?

1034
01:18:11.609 --> 01:18:13.077
What are you gonna do?

1035
01:18:16.848 --> 01:18:19.483
I'm gonna see
if the devil can bleed.

1036
01:19:03.895 --> 01:19:05.763
You take up refuge
near Al's.

1037
01:19:05.796 --> 01:19:07.465
Now, once Mary's free,

1038
01:19:07.498 --> 01:19:09.600
you two stay by each other's
sides, all right?

1039
01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:17.074
You know how to use one?

1040
01:19:18.476 --> 01:19:20.144
Okay, then.

1041
01:19:20.178 --> 01:19:21.879
Off you go.

1042
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.981
Good to see you, Ford.

1043
01:20:01.186 --> 01:20:03.754
I'm very glad
you could join us.

1044
01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:07.024
You see, Mary here...

1045
01:20:08.226 --> 01:20:10.661
She was getting a bit lonely.

1046
01:20:16.534 --> 01:20:17.902
And I thought
I was eventually

1047
01:20:17.935 --> 01:20:20.771
gonna have to put her
out of her misery.

1048
01:20:28.612 --> 01:20:30.881
Glad you showed up
when you did.

1049
01:20:39.191 --> 01:20:42.660
I see you brought you own
personal autobiographer.

1050
01:20:48.032 --> 01:20:49.667
You talk too much.

1051
01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.003
Been accused of that, yes.

1052
01:20:52.703 --> 01:20:55.106
Let her go, Pike.

1053
01:20:57.641 --> 01:20:59.043
Go on, Mary.

1054
01:21:00.278 --> 01:21:02.947
Go give one last goodbye
to your love.

1055
01:21:14.658 --> 01:21:16.194
Are you okay?

1056
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.766
Annabelle's over there.
You go join her.

1057
01:21:22.767 --> 01:21:24.035
Anything happens,

1058
01:21:24.068 --> 01:21:26.804
you both take
the horses and get.

1059
01:21:38.682 --> 01:21:41.319
I love you,
Jericho Ford.

1060
01:21:45.623 --> 01:21:47.024
Go on now.

1061
01:21:56.301 --> 01:21:58.969
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

1062
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.639
It's often hard
you find someone

1063
01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:03.074
you think is worthy
of something like this.

1064
01:22:03.107 --> 01:22:05.643
Goes back hundreds
of years, you know.

1065
01:22:06.211 --> 01:22:07.945
Dueling, that is.

1066
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.682
Oh, I'm familiar
with my history.

1067
01:22:11.715 --> 01:22:13.984
What do you propose?

1068
01:22:14.785 --> 01:22:16.188
Simple, really.

1069
01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:18.989
Each round, we draw.

1070
01:22:19.023 --> 01:22:22.194
Each round,
we get one shot.

1071
01:22:22.227 --> 01:22:24.795
First man to fall
is the loser.

1072
01:22:26.664 --> 01:22:28.200
Perfect.

1073
01:22:39.377 --> 01:22:40.911
He'll win.

1074
01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:44.748
He has to win.

1075
01:22:44.782 --> 01:22:46.984
Nothing is certain
in this life, honey.

1076
01:22:47.017 --> 01:22:50.788
All we can do is pray
that Jericho's faster.

1077
01:24:21.413 --> 01:24:22.947
Ah!

1078
01:25:36.254 --> 01:25:38.223
That's for my friend.

1079
01:25:56.073 --> 01:25:58.209
<i>It was exactly
like I had read about.</i>

1080
01:25:58.243 --> 01:26:02.079
<i>A showdown between two men
to see who was the fastest.</i>

1081
01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:04.182
<i>But as most would seek fame,</i>

1082
01:26:04.215 --> 01:26:07.552
<i>I found one who was seeking
salvation and love.</i>

1083
01:26:07.585 --> 01:26:10.355
<i>A different type of gunslinger
than one would think.</i>

1084
01:26:10.388 --> 01:26:13.558
<i>A different kind
of an outlaw altogether.</i>

1085
01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:01.406
Goodbye, my old friend.

1086
01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:05.577
<i>Just any
other place in the world,</i>

1087
01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:08.380
<i>loss was a factor of life here.</i>

1088
01:27:08.413 --> 01:27:12.116
<i>A consequence of
violence by violent men.</i>

1089
01:27:51.088 --> 01:27:52.490
<i>But still, life goes on.</i>

1090
01:27:52.524 --> 01:27:54.992
<i>And like Mary Primm
once told me,</i>

1091
01:27:55.025 --> 01:27:57.562
<i>"Bad people do get
what they deserve."</i>

1092
01:27:59.431 --> 01:28:01.166
What is it?

1093
01:28:07.772 --> 01:28:10.642
Leave me.

1094
01:28:10.675 --> 01:28:12.444
<i>Some men aren't
made for the wild,</i>

1095
01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:14.646
<i>and those that believe
that they can tame it</i>

1096
01:28:14.679 --> 01:28:17.415
<i>might lose more than
they can ever possibly gain.</i>

1097
01:28:49.481 --> 01:28:51.516
Hello, Miss Angel.

1098
01:28:53.351 --> 01:28:55.220
Do you know who I am?

1099
01:28:55.787 --> 01:28:57.655
Yes, Mr. Hearst.

1100
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:01.259
Splendid.

1101
01:29:01.292 --> 01:29:04.127
Quite the extraordinary story.

1102
01:29:04.162 --> 01:29:08.466
But then, you're quite
the extraordinary journalist,

1103
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.033
aren't you?

1104
01:29:12.604 --> 01:29:15.072
Can you give me
more of that?

1105
01:29:15.105 --> 01:29:18.343
I can certainly try, sir.

1106
01:29:18.376 --> 01:29:21.613
What this country needs
is more stories like that.

1107
01:29:21.646 --> 01:29:24.516
Stories that our children's
children can recite

1108
01:29:24.549 --> 01:29:27.452
and remember
for years to come.

1109
01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:31.054
Someday, outlaws such as this

1110
01:29:31.088 --> 01:29:33.658
will be remembered as heroes.

1111
01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:38.396
They may even become something
of myth and legend.

1112
01:29:38.429 --> 01:29:41.266
And it will be up
to people like you

1113
01:29:41.299 --> 01:29:46.437
to catalog and chronicle
and express their stories,

1114
01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:49.440
regardless of public opinion.

1115
01:29:49.474 --> 01:29:54.345
For that is true
journalism, my dear.

1116
01:30:01.853 --> 01:30:03.488
<i>The West is wild.</i>

1117
01:30:06.491 --> 01:30:08.359
<i>And her name is Freedom.</i>

1118
01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:28.217
