1
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:17.953
Miss angel?

2
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.099
Camp's packed up
and ready to hit the trail.

3
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:24.042
We should reach the outpost
by dusk, ma'am.

4
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.379
Thank you, Mr. Foliet.

5
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.908
I've traveled hundreds
of miles from my home

6
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.810
to a place some has referred to as hell.

7
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.520
A beautiful hell, if you will.

8
00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.233
And tucked away into this corner
of the world that few have ever been

9
00:01:48.317 --> 00:01:51.445
is a world that might only be fit
for the devil himself.

10
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.681
This is a land full of violence

11
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.185
where outlaws, pistoleers,
deserters and murderers

12
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.771
have been calling home
for the past few years.

13
00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.690
But now that the great war has ended,

14
00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:33.195
the east has vowed to end terror
and lawlessness across the land.

15
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.542
And so the capture and the execution
of evil men begins

16
00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:50.587
as bounty hunters,
scalpers and even the army

17
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.215
move in to exact their view
of law and order

18
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.926
upon these expansive yet bloody lands.

19
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.015
We close?

20
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.560
The outpost is just right up ahead.

21
00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.648
All right.

22
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.359
Man's idea of civilization
has arrived.

23
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.736
Arizona is what they call it.

24
00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:19.574
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

25
00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.459
All right. Captain's up ahead here.

26
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.614
- Captain.
- More lambs to the slaughter?

27
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.409
This here is Annabelle angel.

28
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.121
I know who she is, ebb.

29
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.708
You arrived a bit earlier
than we originally expected.

30
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.964
Apologies, sir,
but I had a wonderful guide.

31
00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.091
I do hope I'm not intruding.

32
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.969
Intruding? No.

33
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.973
But I have a question to ask, miss angel.

34
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:29.519
Do thoughts of death visit you often,

35
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.563
or are you just simple minded?

36
00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.358
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

37
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.987
Simple minded would be the answer, then.

38
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.452
The reason I ask is because
no respectable woman in her right mind

39
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.079
ventures to these parts.

40
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.207
In fact, the only women
who ever come around here

41
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.460
are looking to spread their legs
for a few pennies.

42
00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.962
You understand my meaning now?

43
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.633
I do, and my response
is quite simple, indeed.

44
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.010
You are here to do a job,
if I'm not mistaken?

45
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:05.055
Get to the point.

46
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.015
I am as well, sir.

47
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:09.100
It's the job that's made me
travel all these miles.

48
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:14.189
Writing an article for... what is it?

49
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.942
- The San Francisco examiner.
- Right.

50
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:22.697
And this stupid article is worth possibly
being raped and murdered,

51
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.617
shot, out,

52
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.037
or othennise maimed
in this godforsaken desert?

53
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.254
And this article, it's gonna be on the men
we're chasing down out here,

54
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.382
and the good job that my men are doing?

55
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.592
- Yes.

56
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:49.057
Well, I don't have time
to dig deeper into your logic, miss angel,

57
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.769
but please know that I cannot afford

58
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.021
any type of protection for you while
you're here,

59
00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.524
so you'll be on your own.

60
00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.277
I understand.

61
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.530
And if any harm should
come to you while you're here,

62
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.324
it will not be the fault
of the United States army,

63
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.952
and I better not read that
in any newspaper.

64
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.039
The responsibility of some crazy woman

65
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:17.419
that wants to immortalize herself in print
will not be on my head.

66
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.671
I'm not trying to immortalize myself.

67
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.133
Sir.

68
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.759
Pardon?

69
00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.846
You say "sir" when you address me.

70
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.932
I've earned it.

71
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.934
Ebb, show her the lay of the land.

72
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.355
You write your article true, miss angel.

73
00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.736
You write about the cutthroats
and savages

74
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.655
that we're trying to exterminate
from this land.

75
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.658
Well, sir,

76
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.536
I guarantee you that's exactly
what I'll be doing.

77
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.207
Then I expect to see you soon,
I should think.

78
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.422
- Sir.
- Ebb.

79
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.802
Crazy woman.

80
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.976
Well, I'm sure that could've gone
a bit better.

81
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.353
Is he always that inviting?

82
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.855
Miss angel, listen here now.

83
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.776
Hensley ain't one to go
crossing around here.

84
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.945
He's the whole show.

85
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:29.616
He's just as dangerous as any Joe, John
and Harry out here, if not more so.

86
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.371
The man has eyes and ears all over.

87
00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.374
So walk lightly in his presence
if you want to avoid trouble.

88
00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.002
Are those words sticking
with you, miss angel?

89
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.423
Right then.

90
00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.636
We should go get you outfitted.
Get you a place to stay.

91
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.597
Hell, we leave now, we can get
to the junction by nightfall.

92
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.307
What's junction?

93
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.395
Just the place you wanted to write about.

94
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.314
See, those of us who call this place home

95
00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:05.193
refer to it as a neutral patch of land,
if you will.

96
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.903
Now, come on.

97
00:08:58.955 --> 00:08:59.955
Howdy.

98
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.592
Well, this here's the only supply stop.

99
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.475
There's nothing north of us
but injun territory.

100
00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:24.397
Now, most people around here
call this place home.

101
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.568
Mostly because everywhere else
there's a price on their head.

102
00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.199
Well, right over there, that's a saloon.

103
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.701
Or what we call one, anyway.

104
00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.620
It's a rough place.

105
00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.164
You want some answers
or to find someone,

106
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.208
that'd be your best bet.

107
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.668
Right next to it
is churtle b's bathhouse.

108
00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:49.631
Nice hot mineral water comes
straight from the hot Springs.

109
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.716
Also plays home to most
of the whores in town.

110
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.679
Right around, trading post.

111
00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.100
Lanterns, wood, sheets, you name it.

112
00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.685
Man who runs it,
his name is Deacon sparry.

113
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:06.356
Been here since the camp's inception.
Also one you might want to talk to.

114
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.858
Now...

115
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.945
There's one thing
to remember here, miss angel,

116
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.323
is that this place don't
quite like the army much.

117
00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:18.159
They make a lot of coin
off them soldiers.

118
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.537
Interesting sight,
seeing some of these boys in blue

119
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.660
wandering around with the likes
of men you see here.

120
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.292
Were it anywhere else, would be
at the other end of a rope.

121
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.671
But they can't touch them here
in the junction.

122
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:36.678
You mean this place is considered
a safe haven for criminals, Mr. Foliet?

123
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.640
Well, miss angel, you catch on quick.

124
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.059
Why hasn't the army raided it?

125
00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:47.230
Listening to captain hensley back there,
you'd think this place would be in ashes.

126
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.984
The army needs this place just as much
as everyone else does.

127
00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.155
It's an interesting arrangement.

128
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.866
Which is why anywhere else
outside this place is dangerous.

129
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.451
Army's been putting bounties out,

130
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:03.163
attracting folk from all over the country.

131
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.474
They show up looking to shoot the man

132
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.959
whose face is printed
on that piece of paper.

133
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:10.211
And the others?

134
00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:14.090
Ha! They're looking to shoot
the new faces that show up,

135
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:18.887
'cause they figure they're only here
for one reason... those bounties.

136
00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.890
Sounds like a very violent type of life.

137
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.143
Yup, yup.

138
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.395
No truer statement's
ever been made, ma'am.

139
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.832
Right over there,
that's your lodging.

140
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.859
Go on in and talk to vern.
He's got a room arranged for your stay.

141
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.321
I suggest you get your essentials
in the morning,

142
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.949
seeing it's getting to be dark now
and, uh, well...

143
00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.827
This town can get a bit rowdy at night.

144
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.875
You be real careful now, miss angel.

145
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.128
I'd hate to see anything happen to you.

146
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.674
Oh, no.

147
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.510
All right.

148
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:02.555
Thank you.

149
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.934
- Good night, ma'am. Night.
- Good night.

150
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:45.254
That's it now. Who do you want?

151
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.838
What you got in there? You got going...

152
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.537
Jericho Ford.

153
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:08.259
I don't think we'd had the pleasure
of meeting, good sir.

154
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:12.138
All right, gentlemen.
Looks like we're in time for a tussle.

155
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.140
Who's taking bets?
We got corn and Jericho.

156
00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.503
Who's got what? What do you got?

157
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.645
Oh, more to Jericho.

158
00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.522
Who do you want? You got gorn?

159
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:22.606
Right.

160
00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:27.904
Speak up, kid.
I think you're going for corn.

161
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.281
I believe you want gorn.

162
00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:33.993
You, sir, are an idiot going for Jericho.

163
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:36.621
You want gorn or Jericho?

164
00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:38.372
We got one for corn and Jericho.

165
00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:41.375
How about you pour me
a little shot there, baby?

166
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.464
One for Jericho. That's a bad bet, son.
What do you got?

167
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.262
All right. All right, gentlemen,
good luck. You know I'm good for it.

168
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.724
What are you looking at me for?

169
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.520
Darn.

170
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:03.564
Come on, Jericho.

171
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.317
I've heard a lot about you.

172
00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.736
I'm gonna enjoy this.

173
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:12.823
Come on now, gorn!

174
00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.040
Come on, Jericho.

175
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:24.210
All hot air.

176
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.546
No brass balls.

177
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.594
Come on, Jericho! Get him! Come on!

178
00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.224
Take him down! That's it!

179
00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.351
Come on!

180
00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.482
Not a bad little tight.

181
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.485
Looks like we got ourselves a round two!

182
00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.903
Thanks for that.

183
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.990
Well, that could've been
a bit more graceful.

184
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:57.410
Graceful? I'm trying not to get
my head knocked off in there.

185
00:17:57.493 --> 00:18:00.454
You know, big things fall hard, Jericho.

186
00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.208
Didn't know you were in
for dinner and a show.

187
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.253
All right.

188
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.758
All right, here we go.

189
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.303
Round two.

190
00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:16.929
Let's go!

191
00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:38.743
That's what I'm talking about.
Finish him off! Get in there, gorn!

192
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.169
Oh!

193
00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.795
Whoo!

194
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.797
Get up there! Come on, get up!

195
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.263
Ain't no one ring the bell yet?

196
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.808
Come on!

197
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.358
Use your head!

198
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.444
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

199
00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:14.737
Ante's on you, Jericho!

200
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.489
Oh!

201
00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.494
He's on the ground!

202
00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:22.953
Finish him off!

203
00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:24.705
Don't let him get up! Come on!

204
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.374
Oh!

205
00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.292
I felt that.

206
00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.132
Come on! Get up now! Come on!

207
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.564
Well...

208
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:56.987
That is, as they say, that.

209
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.117
You gonna be at the longfellow?

210
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.785
- I'll see you.
- All right, good.

211
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:39.572
You best be careful around here, lady.

212
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:42.592
You might make a man awful nervous,
following him around like you're doing.

213
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:45.202
She ain't following you, Ford.

214
00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:47.079
Don't flatter yourself.

215
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.915
She got better taste in men than that.

216
00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:51.917
I do.

217
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:54.462
I mean, I don't... I mean, I wasn't...

218
00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.174
Wait, let me get my words about me.

219
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:00.509
I wasn't following you.

220
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:04.180
I just heard the commotion outside.

221
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.432
Hey. How'd we do?

222
00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.895
- Good, boss. Better than most nights.
- Yeah?

223
00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:14.440
- And it's all here?
- No skimming.

224
00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:16.108
- No, sir.

225
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.985
Here's what I want you to do.

226
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.782
I want you to find us a couple
of bruisers for next week.

227
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.825
- All right? Keep it coming.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.952
And here, put this in the till.

229
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:29.789
- Yes, sir.
- No skimming.

230
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.000
You did good, Ford.

231
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:36.712
I ought to give you more free booze.

232
00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:41.467
Now, don't let Jericho here fool you.

233
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.137
He's just spent a little too much time
in the sand with the snakes,

234
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.474
and he's forgotten how to treat
a respectable woman.

235
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.519
- Says who?
- Says me.

236
00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:53.771
Now, um...

237
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.818
I don't seem to remember you around,

238
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:01.862
and I know pretty much every face in town.

239
00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:05.157
Yours is not a face I'd forget.

240
00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:07.910
My name's Annabelle angel, sir.

241
00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:11.497
- Ah. The reporter lady.
- That's correct.

242
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.916
Mm-hmm. Yeah, ebb told me about you.

243
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.210
Said, uh...

244
00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.087
He says some fair-haired,
light-skinned woman

245
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.465
might come in here with a set
of legs and ask for stories.

246
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:25.761
Is that what you're doing?
Looking for stories?

247
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.555
What can I get you?

248
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:31.350
- You want some water or tea or milk?
- Whiskey.

249
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:36.021
Whiskey it is.

250
00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:39.650
Forgive me if I am mistaken, but you're
who this establishment belongs?

251
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:43.737
Well, that's an interesting way
to put it, but...

252
00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:49.285
I am who this establishment belongs.
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.370
The name's Albert longfellow.

254
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:54.790
This is indeed my spot,
and you can call me al.

255
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.170
Please, Mr. Longfellow,
join me for another.

256
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.301
Certainly. Yes, ma'am.

257
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:10.806
- So how long you been here?
- Oh, since the beginning.

258
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.977
Since the beginning.
The beginning of time.

259
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:19.481
Since Eve gave Adam the apple.

260
00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:24.570
You know, it wasn't long after that
that the army moved in,

261
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.907
and then they started poking
their nose around these parts.

262
00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:31.619
You're a reporter lady.
You might maybe look into that.

263
00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:37.958
Cheers.

264
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:39.793
Well, what are we cheersin'?

265
00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:41.921
To you being my first friend
in this place.

266
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:49.470
Annabelle angel.

267
00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:53.641
- Is that a pseudonym?
- No.

268
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:58.520
So, what kind of paper would bring you
around here, check out us forgotten souls

269
00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:02.524
here in the most desolate part
of the new United States of America?

270
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:04.944
- San Francisco examiner.
- Oh.

271
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:07.029
George hearst's publication?

272
00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:10.407
You know your press.

273
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:12.493
They sent a lady reporter?

274
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:17.164
They actually weren't going to send
anybody. I volunteered.

275
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:23.879
That's the fifth hand in a row, pike.

276
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:27.466
Ain't nobody that goddamn lucky.

277
00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:35.724
No need for all the commotion, boys.

278
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:40.604
Everybody here, just let's have
an honest game and a nice stiff drink.

279
00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:42.888
I'm sure ai would appreciate it
if you took this outside

280
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.608
before it escalates any further.

281
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.323
Fewer words, buck.
What are you implying?

282
00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:57.246
I'm calling you a two-bit hack
of a gambler who cheats at cards.

283
00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:06.296
Now, then...

284
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:10.509
What do you suggest we do?

285
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:16.640
I assume you have some sort of plan,
being that you're calling me a cheat.

286
00:25:17.808 --> 00:25:19.560
Or am I wrong,

287
00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:23.856
and you are just a man with loose lips
who cannot hold their liquor?

288
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:27.443
You are really a scurvy bastard,
ain't you, pike?

289
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:33.032
What kind of a name is Oslo pike anyway?

290
00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:35.492
Jesus. Al!

291
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:38.912
I don't believe this is
any of your concern, woman.

292
00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.039
Hey!

293
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:45.335
Y'all know the rules, boys.

294
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:49.048
That sign ain't up there for decoration.

295
00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:57.407
Well, would you like me to walk him
all the way to the river

296
00:25:57.431 --> 00:25:58.932
before I shoot him there?

297
00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.980
Would that make it so your night
is no more interrupted, Christine?

298
00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:06.565
You ain't shooting nobody.

299
00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:17.743
"Dost thy ferryman seal our souls
to heaven or hell?" Asked the reaper.

300
00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.662
"To hell," responds god.

301
00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:24.374
And hell was filled with
a thousand screaming voices.

302
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:29.922
You're quite the poet.

303
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:35.177
I think you've done enough here tonight.
You can just take your money and go.

304
00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:47.648
Now, you saw that. They drew first.

305
00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.944
I'd consider that justified.

306
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.612
Wouldn't you, ai?

307
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:57.282
For the mess.

308
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.788
Hello, Ford.

309
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:06.625
Heard you were scrapping outside.
How'd that turn out for you?

310
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:10.295
Well, I'm still here, ain't I?

311
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.589
No bite marks or bullet holes.

312
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:14.258
Yeah. Yet.

313
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:19.513
Well, uh...

314
00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:21.640
What are you carrying there?

315
00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:26.770
Oh, I got $5 says I could put
all six rounds in you

316
00:27:26.854 --> 00:27:29.064
before you can even pull that
out of your holster.

317
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:31.692
Want to make a wager?

318
00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:35.487
Gee, that sounds like
an awfully good time,

319
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:39.366
but, uh, I'm gonna have to decline
your generous offer.

320
00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.286
Too much of a yellow belly, huh?

321
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.039
You know, I'd call it...

322
00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:50.377
Smart, tired and drunk.

323
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:55.340
And I can only assume that you'd
want me at my best, pike.

324
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.177
Or would I be mistaken?

325
00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.513
All right.

326
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:04.516
You've had your pound
of flesh for the night, Oslo.

327
00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:09.605
And my hospitality for you
has run out for the night, so...

328
00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:13.108
Why don't you go slither away?

329
00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:20.199
You're the boss, al.

330
00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:26.663
Be seeing you, Ford.

331
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:41.637
Sometimes you need two shotguns.

332
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.092
Well, well, well.
What we got here, boy?

333
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.637
Good morning.

334
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.764
And good morning to you too.

335
00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.726
What's a pretty little thing like you

336
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.063
doing all the way out here
by yourself, miss...?

337
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.235
Angel. Annabelle angel.

338
00:29:39.236 --> 00:29:41.196
I was just taking a walk, is all.

339
00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.597
Trying to find the river, actually.

340
00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:49.121
Is that so? Angel?

341
00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:51.623
That's a last name, ain't it?

342
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:53.427
Well, the riverbed's
just over yonder there.

343
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:56.336
Kind of dry this time of season, though.

344
00:29:58.255 --> 00:30:00.757
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

345
00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:01.925
I'll be on my way.

346
00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:04.553
What's you in such a hurry for?

347
00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:09.349
I'm writing this story for the newspaper.

348
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.101
Story?

349
00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:14.021
On how well the army's doing
to keep this place safe.

350
00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:17.024
We are doing a good job, ain't we, boys?

351
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:19.067
- We are.
- For sure.

352
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:23.864
You know, it's nice to be
rewarded every once in a while.

353
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.454
You know, for providing our services.
Wouldn't you agree?

354
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.334
I'm sure you could find plenty of reward
in this place you call a town.

355
00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:39.087
Gets a little boring
seeing the same faces...

356
00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:43.717
Over and over and over again.

357
00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:47.262
You know, I asked the good lord...

358
00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:49.097
I did, I asked him

359
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:52.517
if he would send me a real little angel,
just like you.

360
00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:56.497
Fair to say you think my prayers
have been answered?

361
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.065
Come on over here, darling.

362
00:30:58.148 --> 00:31:00.525
Come here. It's all right, darling.

363
00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:07.842
Lower that damn gun and we'll be
gentle with you now.

364
00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.868
Get back! Get back!

365
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.661
Get back, I said.

366
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.206
Look at you.

367
00:31:15.207 --> 00:31:17.584
By the looks of it,
you trembling with that gun.

368
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:20.337
You ain't never shot a gun
a day in your life.

369
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.130
Ain't that right?

370
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.425
Oh, Jesus!
She shot me in the ear!

371
00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.596
Does anybody else not want
to listen to a lady?

372
00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:39.106
Whichever way this ends, you die today.

373
00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.322
Are you boys lost?

374
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:52.786
Can't you tell you interrupting
something here, mister?

375
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:54.579
Mr. Ford, thank god.

376
00:31:56.957 --> 00:31:59.584
Stay back. Drop the gun.

377
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:06.633
I'm gonna take the girl
and we're gonna be on our way.

378
00:32:06.716 --> 00:32:08.927
Go on, keep moving.

379
00:32:11.263 --> 00:32:15.142
I got a tickle telling me
I'm gonna smoke your friend here.

380
00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.810
And I'm gonna take your ear with me.

381
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:19.187
Look, there's no need for violence here.

382
00:32:20.188 --> 00:32:23.024
Let the lady go and we'll all
be the better for it.

383
00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:25.819
You ain't in no position
to be giving me orders.

384
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.196
It wasn't an order. It was a suggestion.

385
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.574
Well, what's the damn difference, then?

386
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:34.119
Well, if it was an order,
it would sound like this.

387
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:37.372
Let the girl go and you can walk
out of here alive.

388
00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:46.339
You're him.

389
00:32:48.008 --> 00:32:49.885
He's on the captain's wall.

390
00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.808
Well, then what the hell
are y'all waiting for?

391
00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:02.647
Stay there. Stay there.

392
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:05.984
Stay back, goddamn it.

393
00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:10.197
I'll cut her from one ear to the other.
I swear, I will.

394
00:33:11.865 --> 00:33:14.367
Then I'm gonna ask you again.

395
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:17.454
Please, let the nice woman go.

396
00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:21.458
If I let her go, you're gonna kill me.

397
00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:25.253
And if you's really on the captain's wall,

398
00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:27.964
that makes you a murderer, you no-good...

399
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:35.680
Mr. Ford.

400
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.032
Oh, the wanderer awakes.

401
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:57.410
You are safe here.
No harm will come to you.

402
00:33:57.494 --> 00:33:59.746
Good thing we came along when we did.

403
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:05.335
The white soldiers care not
for anything here.

404
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.464
You were the one firing at the soldiers.

405
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.134
Thank you.

406
00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:15.720
Thanks are no good here.

407
00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:19.182
Anybody who values life
and has compassion

408
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:21.476
would've done the same thing.

409
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:25.397
I'm not sure I believe that.

410
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.277
Why does a white woman walk
alone in a place such as this?

411
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.280
Well, I was looking for the river.

412
00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:35.240
The river runs dry.

413
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:37.659
So I was told.

414
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:40.537
Where is Mr. Ford?

415
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.457
He's outside indulging himself
in some firewater.

416
00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:49.879
Morning.

417
00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.508
What the hell are you still doing here?

418
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:57.387
Thought you'd be on your way
back to the junction by now.

419
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.556
This ain't no place
for you out here, lady.

420
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:02.767
Well, I do want to say thank you.

421
00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:07.647
What?

422
00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:10.734
You both live here?

423
00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:14.446
Yes, this white buffalo
and I share company together

424
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:17.282
when he's not living
in the bottom of a bottle.

425
00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:19.159
Who are you calling a white buffalo?

426
00:35:20.327 --> 00:35:24.623
Well, now that you've met wasco here
and he's seen you to wake,

427
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:28.835
you can be on your way now,
leave us to our rather simple life.

428
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.796
Hosting company
is not a strength of yours.

429
00:35:32.922 --> 00:35:35.300
Well, I like my peace and quiet.

430
00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:37.302
Mr. Ford, if it's okay,

431
00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:39.346
I'd love to ask you a few questions.

432
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:41.473
For what?

433
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:44.351
Oh, that fancy article
you're writing, huh?

434
00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:48.438
The one where you paint us out to be
all murderous thieves living in caves,

435
00:35:48.521 --> 00:35:49.801
slaughtering women and children?

436
00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:54.903
That's a lot of assumptions
as to what I might write.

437
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:57.322
I've seen quite the opposite, have I not?

438
00:35:57.405 --> 00:35:59.741
He will answer questions.

439
00:36:03.453 --> 00:36:05.747
I swear, if we weren't friends...

440
00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:13.797
Then you'd have been dead
a long time ago.

441
00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.258
Come, sit by the fire.

442
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:20.929
Warm we must keep,
for the snow will be here soon.

443
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.682
Fire, fire, fire.
Fire makes the world go around.

444
00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.768
White man made fire, you know.

445
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.856
He did not.

446
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:56.798
Captain?

447
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.341
What is it?

448
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:10.270
We, uh...

449
00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:13.606
Spit it out.

450
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.317
What happened, private?

451
00:37:17.944 --> 00:37:20.029
We was ambushed, sir.

452
00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:23.324
Ambushed?

453
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.286
Ambushed by who?

454
00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:28.621
Speak, son, and be detailed.

455
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:33.084
We was escorting that reporter lady
through the junction,

456
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:35.170
down by the barn...

457
00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:39.841
And a man jumped us.

458
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:42.552
And how many of you were there?

459
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.347
Three, sir.

460
00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:51.686
So one man took on three military-trained
individuals and came out the Victor?

461
00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.900
No, sir. I'm certain that he had help.

462
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:00.069
Rifle fire came from somewhere else.

463
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.032
So two men did this, then?

464
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.743
That'd be my guess, sir.

465
00:38:08.203 --> 00:38:09.621
Well, what about the girl?

466
00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:16.711
They, uh...
They absconded with her, sir.

467
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:21.007
Stay away from big words, private.
They don't agree with you.

468
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.344
Did you get a look at these men?

469
00:38:26.429 --> 00:38:29.724
I got a real good
up-close look at one, sir.

470
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:33.019
And what did he look like?

471
00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:38.233
It was him.

472
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.411
This man?

473
00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:02.215
Muster an escort for me.
I'm going to apache junction.

474
00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:06.511
- Sir.
- What is it?

475
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.099
He killed your boy, sir.

476
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.565
John's dead?

477
00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.484
Yes, sir.

478
00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:24.445
Sorry, sir.

479
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:30.785
Boy never was too bright anyway.

480
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:34.080
Go on.

481
00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.966
But he was a soldier.

482
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:49.262
And justice will roll like a river,

483
00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:52.599
righteousness like a never-ending stream.

484
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.072
How'd you both find this place?
How'd you come to meet?

485
00:40:08.156 --> 00:40:10.408
One question at a time, lady.

486
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:14.245
I was born here, me and my people.

487
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.039
And where are they now?

488
00:40:22.962 --> 00:40:24.631
I came out from the plains.

489
00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:27.425
Drove cattle out there
for a while until the war hit.

490
00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:28.885
And then?

491
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:33.306
You're just a mighty bit nosy, ain't you?

492
00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:34.849
That's my job.

493
00:40:36.059 --> 00:40:39.562
Well, I'd be looking for a more
respectable occupation, if you ask me.

494
00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:41.105
Says the outlaw.

495
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.815
Who said I'm a wanted man?

496
00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:46.778
Alas, what would a respectable occupation
be for me anyways, Mr. Ford?

497
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:52.200
Gander a guess that you come here
because you've done something awful bad.

498
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:56.371
Unlike your compatriot wasco,
who was born in this land,

499
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.914
you had to migrate here.

500
00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:01.626
And from my understanding, the men
that learned to call this place home are...

501
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.795
Murderers and thieves.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

502
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.047
Like I said, lady, you is nosy,

503
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.300
and exactly why no one
respects a person of your occupation.

504
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:13.596
Jericho came out west because he did not
want to fight the great war.

505
00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:17.475
So you left before it started?

506
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:22.814
Well, it didn't make sense to go fighting
other people's battles.

507
00:41:24.357 --> 00:41:27.110
The white man's drink
does funny things to the mind.

508
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:29.028
All right, that's enough.

509
00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:33.199
No, it's important that she knows
how this relationship was forged.

510
00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:37.412
Jericho took a bad fall hunting one day.

511
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:40.957
Me and my people took him in,
saw that he was healed.

512
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:46.087
The army offered a reward
for any Indian brought in, dead or alive.

513
00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:52.427
You know, I know I got a bottle
around here somewhere.

514
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.596
Army men arrived one day.
Began to do what they do best.

515
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.099
I know I have a bottle
around here somewhere.

516
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:03.104
Murder.

517
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.398
Jericho decided to respond back with lead.

518
00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:08.234
And that was
the end of the story.

519
00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:12.447
These lands
have seen enough bloodshed

520
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.116
to last a lifetime, miss Annabelle.

521
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:17.744
It's never in our best interest
to spill more.

522
00:42:19.287 --> 00:42:21.622
We all have a history
that brought us here.

523
00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:23.124
But like my people before,

524
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:28.254
we've all been written to be the devil
in a land that's not theirs to give.

525
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.268
Well...

526
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.228
Would appear to be quite
the party, then.

527
00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:46.773
Mary, what the hell are you doing
out here all by yourself?

528
00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:49.525
I am a grown woman.
I think I can handle myself.

529
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:52.361
Oh, yeah, that's what this one
thought earlier today,

530
00:42:52.445 --> 00:42:54.530
till hensley's troops tried
to raise her skirt.

531
00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.118
Are you okay, darling?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

532
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.953
No, they didn't...

533
00:43:01.037 --> 00:43:03.998
Thanks to Mr. Ford and Mr. Wasco here.

534
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.876
What happened?

535
00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.550
Well, I might've had
to shoot one of them.

536
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:19.305
Three?

537
00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:21.891
Yeah, that does sound more accurate.

538
00:43:21.974 --> 00:43:25.144
Those military boys
will be up in arms, Jericho.

539
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:26.938
You know it as well as anyone.

540
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.900
I'm afraid we haven't
had the chance to meet yet.

541
00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:33.820
Yeah, this here is the newspaper lady.

542
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:35.363
Annabelle angel.

543
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.907
Mary... primm.

544
00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:42.870
I brought some fresh vegetables...

545
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.873
And something to drink.

546
00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:51.003
Mwah! Sweet Jesus.

547
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:57.218
What about you, Annabelle?

548
00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:59.637
- What you like?
- Some bread, please.

549
00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:02.723
- I got you covered.
- Thank you.

550
00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:08.437
It's horrible, you know?

551
00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:11.023
All those women and children,
just defenseless,

552
00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:13.109
slaughtered in the middle of the night.

553
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:16.612
No badge could help that.
They'd have needed their own army.

554
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:19.662
I guess you can't change the past,
now can you?

555
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.790
Evening, ai.

556
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.753
Captain.

557
00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:39.635
What the hell did we do for him
to grace us with his presence?

558
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.097
Should I fetch the scattergun,
miss Williams?

559
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:46.225
No, al's got it behind the bar.
Just go about your business.

560
00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:53.357
Place looks good.
Business looks better.

561
00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:55.985
What the hell are you doing here?

562
00:44:57.486 --> 00:45:00.281
Is that any way to greet an old friend?

563
00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:03.367
We got rules. You're breaking them.

564
00:45:05.077 --> 00:45:06.078
Oh, yeah.

565
00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.625
We don't come looking
for wanted men here at the junction,

566
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:15.588
and our outpost continues
to receive goods and services.

567
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.382
An honorable agreement,

568
00:45:18.466 --> 00:45:22.887
yet beyond counterproductive
to my work, ai.

569
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.181
It's kept you fed.

570
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:26.891
Kept you clothed.

571
00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:28.976
You here to balk at that agreement?

572
00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:33.439
Miss Williams,
the mouth that never closes.

573
00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:36.651
Don't you have a brothel to run?

574
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:39.070
You don't have a dog in this fight.

575
00:45:39.153 --> 00:45:43.157
Well, it's worked so far,
so I'm gonna ask you one more time.

576
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:45.785
What are you doing here?

577
00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:50.331
Well, it appears,
and, of course, I'm just guessing here,

578
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:54.919
that one of your customers dispatched
some of my soldiers this morning.

579
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.756
Well, that's unfortunate.

580
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:03.594
However, it did not happen
within the confines of my walls,

581
00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:05.763
so it doesn't make it my problem, does it?

582
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:11.519
So I'm guessing it's out of the question
to ask you if you've seen this man.

583
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.522
- Out of the question.
- Out of the question.

584
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:17.984
Christine... let me to my business.

585
00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:21.529
Al, if I wanted to, I could gather
all the men at my disposal

586
00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:25.032
and march them in this shitty little town
of yours and burn it to the ground.

587
00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:30.204
Meat and grain and women,
all those things are replaceable.

588
00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:34.083
So all these many years that I've let you
keep these walls standing

589
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:37.378
and keep me from the one step
that I need to make

590
00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:41.215
to completely obliterate
the lawlessness in this territory,

591
00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:43.592
I'm asking you to do
one thing for me now.

592
00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:47.054
You tell me the next time
you see this man.

593
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:49.765
And for the rest of you...

594
00:46:51.225 --> 00:46:54.270
I know there's many men in here
that I'd love to show the noose

595
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:57.356
and see them ride the pine
straight to the devil.

596
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.608
But I lost soldiers today.

597
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:04.488
And an innocent civilian in the form
of that reporter from San Francisco

598
00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:05.656
got kidnapped.

599
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:11.329
So I'm offering a bonus of up to $200

600
00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:15.124
for the man or men
that bring me Jericho Ford.

601
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:17.835
I want him dead or alive.

602
00:47:19.462 --> 00:47:20.755
Dead would be preferable.

603
00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:24.592
What about that girl
you were talking about?

604
00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:28.095
Extra $50 if you find her.

605
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:31.432
If not, I'll consider her
a casualty of war.

606
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:37.146
It's been fun, al.

607
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:40.316
I know I'll be hearing from you very soon.

608
00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:41.567
Let's go.

609
00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:49.617
No way Ford done what he said, ai.

610
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.869
He's not that kind of man.
You know it, I know it.

611
00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:54.080
Yeah? Are you sure about that, Christine?

612
00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.003
With all the trash and hooligans
running around this town?

613
00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.216
I know a good man when I see him.

614
00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:08.010
You certainly do.

615
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:12.306
I'll tell you what's more important
thaninnocence.

616
00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:14.767
Survival.

617
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.852
- Hmm.
- The way I look at it,

618
00:48:16.936 --> 00:48:19.980
we got a lot more outlaws than army boys
around these parts.

619
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:24.568
So if you're starting to think that you
might want to turn Ford in, well...

620
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:28.340
You don't think these hooligans
might start thinking

621
00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:30.550
the honorable ai longfellow
might do the same thing to them

622
00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.701
if the opportunity presented itself?

623
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:39.959
If it was me, I'd start
sleeping with one eye open

624
00:48:40.042 --> 00:48:43.754
and my hand clutched around my pistol,
if I was gonna head down that road.

625
00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:48.175
- You're a smart woman.
- Hmm.

626
00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:50.428
That I am.

627
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:12.158
Thank you.

628
00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:19.999
It's different, right?

629
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.294
What's that?

630
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:25.838
It's different from what you thought
you'd find here?

631
00:49:28.174 --> 00:49:30.384
I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.

632
00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:39.143
Society has this place pegged
as a ruthless land full of criminals.

633
00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:43.606
And captain hensley and his agenda
clearing out the rabble

634
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:46.692
to make way for a "proper" civilization.

635
00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:52.531
At least, I am assuming that is
how the rest of our newfound United States

636
00:49:52.615 --> 00:49:55.868
views our little corner of the world
that we've carved out for ourselves.

637
00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.872
They never had a chance
to think any different.

638
00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:04.418
You can be that chance.

639
00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:11.091
There are people here that are
just trying to live their lives.

640
00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:16.263
They like having a small piece of earth...

641
00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:18.807
Where they aren't judged every day.

642
00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.227
We all may be misfits,

643
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.189
but it helps it go down
a bit smoother, you know,

644
00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:28.317
when society ain't inflicting its view
of law and order upon us.

645
00:50:31.529 --> 00:50:36.116
What about the ones that actually
have done the unspeakable in their past?

646
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.078
How does one justify the continued freedom

647
00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:43.249
to the loved ones who have had someone
or something taken from them?

648
00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:49.088
Honey... I have learned that bad people

649
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:52.883
get what they deserve
in some form or another.

650
00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:57.096
Whether that be now
or ten years from now,

651
00:50:57.179 --> 00:51:00.015
the lord and the devil alike
see that justice be done.

652
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:03.978
You can't let bad people go unpunished.

653
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.522
There has to be some sort
of law and order, Mary.

654
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:09.692
Yeah, I suppose there does.

655
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.573
Don't let the view fool you.

656
00:51:16.574 --> 00:51:18.492
This place has its disadvantages.

657
00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.371
Like what, exactly?

658
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:27.293
Look at me, Annabelle.

659
00:51:28.711 --> 00:51:30.337
I'm a whore.

660
00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:35.134
As long as I stay here,
I'll always be a whore.

661
00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:38.721
But that's your decision, is it not?

662
00:51:38.804 --> 00:51:41.724
There's nothing else here. Not for women.

663
00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:44.059
I'm not sure I believe that to be true.

664
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.770
You've seen it.

665
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:48.355
The looks you get.

666
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:52.109
No one can believe
someone like you is here.

667
00:51:53.652 --> 00:51:57.489
They haven't seen a woman
with freedom of expression.

668
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:02.161
You could leave.

669
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.998
Not without him.

670
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:11.754
You love him?

671
00:52:13.172 --> 00:52:15.090
I think I do.

672
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:17.801
I'm gonna put that in my story.

673
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:21.221
- What's that?
- That this place isn't lost.

674
00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:23.349
That there's warmth here.

675
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:25.601
Kindness and love exist.

676
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:33.317
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

677
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.280
Why not?

678
00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:45.371
A man like Jericho Ford doesn't want to
spend the rest of his life with a whore.

679
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:50.167
Well, my observations tell
quite a different story, Mary.

680
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.224
I'll be back tomorrow.

681
00:53:07.559 --> 00:53:09.353
Don't burn the camp down
while I'm away.

682
00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:11.730
Stay away from the drink, my friend.

683
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:13.751
It's okay. You're okay.

684
00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:17.755
You're okay.

685
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:26.555
Goodbye, Mary.

686
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:29.224
Oh, I'm sure I'll be seeing
you soon enough, Annabelle.

687
00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:33.103
I'm gonna walk miss primm
back to her residence.

688
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:42.404
If you like, you're welcome
to follow me back when I leave.

689
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.912
What? Wasco likes the company, is all.

690
00:54:49.995 --> 00:54:52.289
She's educated.
He likes that sort of thing.

691
00:54:52.372 --> 00:54:54.124
Gives him someone to talk to.

692
00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.710
I would love to, Mr. Ford.

693
00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:58.796
I'll just grab a couple things
from my room.

694
00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:00.464
Yeah, take your time.

695
00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.883
I got to go to al's
and get me a bottle or two.

696
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.928
Go to the store. Wasco needs spices.

697
00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.561
Since when did you get a heart?

698
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:16.980
Woman, I've always had one.

699
00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:20.317
It's been sitting right here,
beating away each and every day.

700
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.778
- Is that so?
- That's a fact.

701
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:30.911
You're a good man, Jericho Ford.

702
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:35.874
I'm a lucky girl to have
someone like you in my life.

703
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.628
No, you ain't, Mary. I...

704
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:45.300
I should be doing a hell
of a lot better by you, Mary.

705
00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.681
Someday.

706
00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:54.142
Someday, we'll leave this place.

707
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:58.689
We'll leave this place,
and all the baggage that comes with it.

708
00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:02.943
I guess we all got to stop
running sometime, right?

709
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:16.433
The blood-soaked
lawless sands of Arizona

710
00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:19.144
are not what they would appear.

711
00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:23.315
I have found the beginnings of friendship
in a few of the residents here.

712
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:28.862
Upper-class society will condemn them
as criminals, traitors, savages, even.

713
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:33.075
But I have now witnessed
the blossoming buds of love and hope

714
00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:36.703
in a place that before
I never would've thought possible.

715
00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:40.207
This place still has many faces
that it has not yet shown,

716
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.960
but if the hospitality
I have received so far

717
00:57:43.043 --> 00:57:46.213
is any indication of this place
and its people,

718
00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:50.467
it is not what the modern world
would have everyone believe.

719
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:52.928
The only real monsters
I have encountered

720
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:56.682
were the ones that were put
here to protect people like me.

721
00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:58.767
Irony weaves a winding road.

722
00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:11.196
It's a little empty in here, ain't it?

723
00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:14.282
We closed today.

724
00:58:15.742 --> 00:58:19.246
Five years I've been coming to this joint,
and I never seen you close.

725
00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:25.502
The captain came and paid us a visit.

726
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:31.383
He said you shot some of his boys...

727
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.930
And you kidnapped that reporter lady.

728
00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:39.016
Yeah, those boys were gonna rape her.

729
00:58:40.267 --> 00:58:42.477
But she's here right now
in her hotel room.

730
00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.396
By her own free will.

731
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.983
If I don't do something,

732
00:58:48.984 --> 00:58:51.194
they're gonna burn it all down, Ford.

733
00:59:01.747 --> 00:59:04.082
I known you a long time, friend.

734
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:07.085
And I said to myself,

735
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:11.590
"no, I don't think Jericho
kidnapped no woman."

736
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:18.346
But I had to give him something,
you understand?

737
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.018
Not really, ai.

738
00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.860
I had to break my own rules, Jericho.

739
00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:42.204
That's the best I can do for you, Ford.

740
00:59:44.164 --> 00:59:46.644
You're gonna have to shoot your own way
out of this one. Go on.

741
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.298
Give 'em hell, Ford.

742
00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:56.927
For all of us.

743
01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:36.817
[Gunshofl

744
01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.072
sorry.

745
01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.033
Come on.

746
01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.886
All right, I think we lost them.

747
01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.056
We got to get back to wasco.

748
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.191
Mr. Ford?

749
01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:00.193
We'll go out the back.

750
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.657
I think I've been shot.

751
01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:13.123
Okay. It's okay, Annabelle. We just need
to get you back to camp, all right?

752
01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.333
Wasco's gonna fix you up.
He's gonna fix you up.

753
01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.085
It's okay, it's okay.

754
01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.571
Hello, Mary.

755
01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.582
Wasco! Wasco!

756
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.543
Wasco!

757
01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:00.587
Wasco!

758
01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.424
- What happened?
- They were waiting for me.

759
01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.801
- Who?
- The soldiers, Higgins boys.

760
01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:10.597
They attacked you while you were in camp?
That's not part of the agreement.

761
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.848
There's no more agreements.

762
01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.267
The bullet went through.

763
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.770
We'll need some clean water, some cotton,

764
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.065
either from your shirt
or from your pillow. I do not care which.

765
01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.948
Well, is she gonna be okay?
Is she gonna live?

766
01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.694
As long as you move quickly,
we can save her life.

767
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.158
You'll be okay, my dear. I promise you.

768
01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:57.768
Sir?

769
01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.106
This man claims to have
information about Jericho Ford.

770
01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:10.573
Information, huh?

771
01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:15.370
Oh, I never claimed
to have the information.

772
01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.832
What good are you to me?

773
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.628
She is the one with the information.

774
01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:27.257
I say again, what good
are you to me, then?

775
01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:33.638
I am the hilt in which the hand
holds to do its bidding, sir.

776
01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:40.061
I don't have time for riddles.
Speak plainly.

777
01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:43.481
I just watched Jericho fend off
an infamous gang

778
01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.024
known as the Higgins boys.

779
01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.108
Now...

780
01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:51.823
I am confident that I am the only one
who can kill Jericho Ford.

781
01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:57.245
Othennise, you can keep sending
your men to do the job,

782
01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:58.788
but your bill to the undertaker?

783
01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:02.792
Well, that's gonna keep getting
more expensive as the days wane on.

784
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:10.258
The men out there are speaking
as if this Ford cannot be killed.

785
01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.094
But I say,

786
01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:16.556
"if a man can bleed, he can surely die."

787
01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.435
You. Who are you in all of this?

788
01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.731
I'm no one.

789
01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:29.569
Well, clearly you're somebody
of importance in this situation.

790
01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.947
If I may.

791
01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:39.120
I do believe I can extract the information
out of her, given my methods.

792
01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:42.499
Who are you?

793
01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.253
Won't matter somewhere.

794
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.090
The name's Oslo pike.

795
01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:54.969
And what do you want out of all this?
The money?

796
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.058
Two things and two things only.

797
01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.438
First, I want my name free and clear.

798
01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:09.484
I believe you can do that with a simple
letter over to a Mr. Wells in Nebraska,

799
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.987
explaining how my services were exemplary

800
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:17.075
in the catching and killing
of a notorious criminal in these parts.

801
01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.994
And the second thing?

802
01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:23.331
I want the honor of killing Jericho Ford.

803
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.709
How do you plan on doing that?

804
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.338
I am faster than he is.

805
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.882
You make this sound like
a dime novel, Mr. Pike.

806
01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:35.760
Oh, there have been plenty of them
written about me, sir.

807
01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.639
Oslo pike.

808
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.476
Bellevue, Nebraska.

809
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:49.148
And you don't want any of the money?

810
01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:53.319
Fame and fear will
buy you the world, captain.

811
01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.655
I have tasted both,

812
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.992
and clearly the killing of Mr. Ford
is surely gonna bring me more,

813
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:03.121
therefore, I do not require
your physical currency.

814
01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.749
You're an interesting character, Mr. Pike.

815
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.168
Do we have a deal?

816
01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:20.847
Now...

817
01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.934
Have you ever seen an eyeball pop?

818
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.813
It is a most interesting sight.

819
01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:30.815
You see...

820
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.486
When a sharp object punctures it,

821
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:37.655
it just deflates like a balloon.

822
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:41.159
Some say that there is no pain.

823
01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.204
You see, but the fear
is not losing the eyes.

824
01:08:47.248 --> 01:08:48.791
It's more complex.

825
01:08:50.168 --> 01:08:53.212
When you're plunged
into complete darkness...

826
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.634
There's no telling
where the blade might out next.

827
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.598
Hmm.

828
01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:08.895
They say a person can
withstand a thousand cuts.

829
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:12.982
Surely that would be painful.

830
01:09:14.025 --> 01:09:15.234
Close your eyes.

831
01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.572
Go ahead. Close them.

832
01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.700
Go on. Close them.

833
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:25.453
- I said close them!
- Ewmm

834
01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.630
Now I'm gonna give you one chance to tell
me where Jericho's camp is,

835
01:09:35.713 --> 01:09:36.881
and if you do not,

836
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:40.426
not only will I take your eyes
and shroud you into eternal darkness,

837
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.261
but I will make sure you are so disfigured

838
01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.972
that even dogs will walk away
at the very sight of you.

839
01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:46.056
Mwmm

840
01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:49.644
open your eyes.

841
01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.439
You look at me.

842
01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.821
Where is he?

843
01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.796
She will live.

844
01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:25.388
I've seen that look in your eye
many times before.

845
01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.515
Jencho.

846
01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.060
Jericho, where are you going?

847
01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:34.564
- Jericho, where are you going?!
- What do you think?

848
01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:37.567
- To kill someone?
- Is it so obvious?

849
01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.318
That will solve nothing.

850
01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.070
I don't need any of your preaching today.

851
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.866
Just let me get it done.

852
01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:04.552
You know, you start coming into these odd,

853
01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:09.599
sort of bivouac shantytowns.

854
01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:13.311
Sometimes you want a break.
I was gonna take a vacation.

855
01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.689
Take some days off for myself.

856
01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.567
I got a kid at home.

857
01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.029
Shelby.

858
01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.327
A man's still gotta make a living,

859
01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.455
and I am just well within my lawful rights

860
01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.874
to pursue the type
of living that I'm doing.

861
01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.251
Pour that drink, Jose.

862
01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.019
You know, you took the lives...

863
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.774
Of a few folk who were quite dear to me.

864
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:05.696
Turn around.
I don't like to shoot a man in the back.

865
01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.952
Well, I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

866
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.269
Be a shame to waste it.

867
01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.878
This seems familiar.

868
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.801
Is it bad?

869
01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.887
You'll live to fight another day.

870
01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.559
Where's Mr. Ford?

871
01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.645
Returning soon. Try to get some rest.

872
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:49.717
Where are you, boy?
Come home now. Come home.

873
01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.346
[Gunshofl

874
01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:58.828
Where is he?

875
01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.913
I do not know.

876
01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:04.709
Suppose you don't have any idea
when he'll be back, then?

877
01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.085
Do you?

878
01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:13.342
You know, I've killed
a lot of people before.

879
01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.724
But I've never killed no injun before.

880
01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.352
It's no more pleasurable
than taking any life.

881
01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.856
Oh, I doubt that very much.

882
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.193
You see, I think your death

883
01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.989
is gonna contribute greatly to my cause.

884
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:39.910
Evil men live only long enough
to see their end.

885
01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.373
Well, I guess we must all die sometime.

886
01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.736
You tell Ford to meet me
at the thoroughfare.

887
01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:34.423
Wasco. Annabelle.

888
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.892
I'm sorry.

889
01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.020
I'm sorry.

890
01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:56.070
I'm so sorry.

891
01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:19.593
It ain't your fault.
It ain't your fault.

892
01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:22.138
I should've been here.

893
01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.390
I should've been here.

894
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.531
It was that man.

895
01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.124
Pike.

896
01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:08.976
Jencho?

897
01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.105
What are you gonna do?

898
01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:19.612
I'm gonna see if the devil can bleed.

899
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.699
You take up refuge near al's.

900
01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:09.203
Now, once Mary's free, you two stay
by each other's sides, all right?

901
01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.002
You know how to use one?

902
01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:19.672
Okay, then.

903
01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:21.840
Off you go.

904
01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:56.959
Good to see you, Ford.

905
01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:03.674
I'm very glad you could join us.

906
01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:07.011
You see, Mary here...

907
01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.264
She was getting a bit lonely.

908
01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:20.691
And I thought I was eventually
gonna have to put her out of her misery.

909
01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.826
Glad you showed up when you did.

910
01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:42.546
I see you brought
your own personal autobiographer.

911
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.553
You talk too much.

912
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:51.847
Been accused of that, yes.

913
01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:55.184
Let her go, pike.

914
01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.021
Go on, Mary.

915
01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.900
Go give one last goodbye to your love.

916
01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:16.205
Are you okay?

917
01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:21.668
Annabelle's over there. You go join her.

918
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.715
Anything happens,
you both take the horses and get.

919
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.355
I love you, Jericho Ford.

920
01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:46.693
Go on now.

921
01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.914
I've been waiting a long time for this.

922
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:03.043
It's often hard you find someone you think
is worthy of something like this.

923
01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:05.212
Goes back hundreds of years, you know.

924
01:22:06.213 --> 01:22:07.881
Dueling, that is.

925
01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.552
Oh, I'm familiar with my history.

926
01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.720
What do you propose?

927
01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:16.181
Simple, really.

928
01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:18.934
Each round, we draw.

929
01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.019
Each round, we get one shot.

930
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.690
First man to fall is the loser.

931
01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:27.901
Perfect.

932
01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.831
He'll win.

933
01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.292
He has to win.

934
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:46.920
Nothing is certain in this life, honey.

935
01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:50.674
All we can do is pray
that Jericho's faster.

936
01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.473
Ah!

937
01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.076
[Gunshofl

938
01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:38.175
That's for my friend.

939
01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.153
It was exactly
like I had read about...

940
01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:01.990
A showdown between two men
to see who was the fastest.

941
01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:04.117
But as most would seek fame,

942
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:07.579
I found one who was seeking
salvation and love.

943
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.332
A different type of gunslinger
than one would think.

944
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:13.585
A different kind of an outlaw altogether.

945
01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.299
Goodbye, my old friend.

946
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:06.471
Just any other place
in the world,

947
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.348
loss was a factor of life here,

948
01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:12.018
a consequence of violence by violent men.

949
01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.059
But still, life goes on.

950
01:27:53.143 --> 01:27:54.853
And like Mary primm once told me,

951
01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.564
"bad people do get what they deserve."

952
01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.067
What is it?

953
01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.493
Leave me.

954
01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.472
Some men aren't
made for the wild,

955
01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.664
and those that believe
that they can tame it

956
01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:17.375
might lose more than
they can ever possibly gain.

957
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.201
Hello, miss angel.

958
01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.871
Do you know who I am?

959
01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:57.457
Yes, Mr. Hearst.

960
01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:00.751
Splendid.

961
01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:04.464
Quite the extraordinary story.

962
01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:09.177
But then, you're quite
the extraordinaryjournalist, aren't you?

963
01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.933
Can you give me more of that?

964
01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:17.018
I can certainly try, sir.

965
01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:21.606
What this country needs
is more stories like that.

966
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.484
Stories that our children's
children can recite

967
01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:26.987
and remember for years to come.

968
01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:33.660
Someday, outlaws such as this
will be remembered as heroes.

969
01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:38.123
They may even become something
of myth and legend.

970
01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:41.167
And it will be up to people like you

971
01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:46.006
to catalog and chronicle
and express their stories,

972
01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:49.301
regardless of public opinion.

973
01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:54.264
For that is true journalism, my dear.

974
01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:03.557
The west is wild.

975
01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.278
And her name is freedom.
