1
00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:15.641
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:19.658
The poison is still fresh, three days.

3
00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:21.584
They're following us.

4
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.444
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.089
This is it.

6
00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:55.575
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

7
00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.698
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.

8
00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.402
He was good.

9
00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:02.192
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:05.794
<i>Señor,</i> nobody's come out of there alive.

11
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.668
Please...

12
00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:45.973
<i>Señor.</i>

13
00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.505
Stop.

14
00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:18.472
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.451
Forrestal.

16
00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:31.318
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.725
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:54.655 --> 00:06:55.906
Stay here.

19
00:06:56.135 --> 00:06:57.628
If you insist, <i>señor.</i>

20
00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:25.623
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:26.816
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:30.768
No time to argue.

23
00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:32.671
Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.529
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.409
<i>Adiós, señor.</i>

26
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:20.978
<i>Adiós,</i> Satipo.

27
00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:03.179
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:03.596 --> 00:10:06.056
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:07.707
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.674
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:22.658
You chose the wrong friends.

32
00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:25.283
This time, it will cost you.

33
00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:29.463
Too bad the Hovitos

34
00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:32.377
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

35
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:34.613
Yes, too bad.

36
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:39.154
You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

37
00:11:26.345 --> 00:11:28.252
Jock! Start the engines!

38
00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:29.713
Get it up!

39
00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:35.341
Jock, the engines!

40
00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:37.695
Start the engines, Jock!

41
00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:29.522
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

42
00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:32.891
Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie!

43
00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:35.398
I hate snakes, Jock!

44
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.920
I hate 'em!

45
00:12:36.973 --> 00:12:39.684
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

46
00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:57.723
"Neo," meaning "new"

47
00:12:57.748 --> 00:13:01.460
and "Lithic"... "I-T-H"

48
00:13:01.932 --> 00:13:04.578
"I-C," meaning "stone."

49
00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:06.379
All right, let's get back to this site:

50
00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:07.988
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

51
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:12.928
Contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

52
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:21.419
don't confuse that with robbing,
in which case we mean

53
00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:24.222
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

54
00:13:24.822 --> 00:13:26.740
This site also demonstrates...

55
00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.405
one of the great dangers of archaeology,

56
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.600
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.

57
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.678
No, I'm talking about folklore.

58
00:13:37.394 --> 00:13:39.104
In this case, local tradition held

59
00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:42.047
that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,

60
00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:45.887
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

61
00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:48.205
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

62
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.149
However, chamber three was undisturbed,

63
00:13:51.174 --> 00:13:52.861
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

64
00:13:52.885 --> 00:13:54.750
that were found in another, uh

65
00:13:54.952 --> 00:13:56.745
in the area, give us a r...

66
00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:04.509
Reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

67
00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:06.285
uh, find as we have.

68
00:14:07.395 --> 00:14:08.647
Any questions, then?

69
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.350
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

70
00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:14.035
Um, don't forget...

71
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.199
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

72
00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:20.812
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

73
00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:31.843
I had it, Marcus.

74
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:33.779
I had it in my hand.

75
00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:36.026
- What happened?
- Guess.

76
00:14:38.314 --> 00:14:40.232
- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?

77
00:14:40.349 --> 00:14:41.601
Not at all.

78
00:14:41.626 --> 00:14:43.651
I'm sure everything
you do for the museum

79
00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:46.845
conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.

80
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.243
It's beautiful, Marcus.

81
00:14:48.268 --> 00:14:50.186
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

82
00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:51.949
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

83
00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:54.374
- I need $2,000. Look...
- Listen to me, old boy.

84
00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.800
- I brought some people to see you.
- Look.

85
00:14:56.825 --> 00:14:59.530
I got these pieces.
They're good pieces, Marcus.

86
00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:01.150
- Look.
- Indiana...

87
00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:04.749
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

88
00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:06.294
- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least

89
00:15:06.318 --> 00:15:09.252
- the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
- But the people I brought are important,

90
00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:10.712
- and they're waiting.
- What people?

91
00:15:10.736 --> 00:15:12.184
Army Intelligence.

92
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:14.404
They knew you were coming before I did.

93
00:15:14.482 --> 00:15:15.874
Seem to know everything.

94
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:17.925
They wouldn't tell me what they want.

95
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.910
Well, what do I want to see them for?

96
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.627
What am I, in trouble?

97
00:15:22.152 --> 00:15:24.871
Yes, Dr. Jones,
we've heard a great deal about you.

98
00:15:24.896 --> 00:15:26.111
Have you?

99
00:15:26.136 --> 00:15:28.379
Uh, professor of archaeology,

100
00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:30.313
expert on the occult,

101
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.439
and, uh, how does one say it?

102
00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.133
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

103
00:15:35.158 --> 00:15:36.324
That's one way of saying it.

104
00:15:36.448 --> 00:15:37.760
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

105
00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:39.285
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

106
00:15:39.365 --> 00:15:42.005
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

107
00:15:42.862 --> 00:15:45.073
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

108
00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:46.793
at the University of Chicago.

109
00:15:47.025 --> 00:15:48.416
Yes, I did.

110
00:15:49.265 --> 00:15:51.810
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

111
00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:55.261
Well, just rumors, really.

112
00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:56.841
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

113
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.619
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

114
00:15:58.643 --> 00:16:00.395
We were friends, but, uh

115
00:16:01.424 --> 00:16:03.531
had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.

116
00:16:05.275 --> 00:16:07.528
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

117
00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:10.021
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

118
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:11.679
I understand.

119
00:16:13.968 --> 00:16:17.355
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

120
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.342
intercepted a...
a German communiquė

121
00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:22.703
that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

122
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.145
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

123
00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:27.129
the Nazis have had
teams of archaeologists

124
00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:30.855
running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.

125
00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:32.926
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

126
00:16:32.964 --> 00:16:35.637
He's crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.

127
00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:37.764
And, right now, apparently,

128
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.207
there's some kind
of German archaeological dig

129
00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.507
going on in the desert outside of Cairo.

130
00:16:42.532 --> 00:16:44.238
Now, we've got some information here,

131
00:16:44.263 --> 00:16:47.013
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

132
00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.711
"Tanis development proceeding."

133
00:16:51.062 --> 00:16:54.899
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra."

134
00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:57.419
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

135
00:16:58.595 --> 00:17:00.502
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

136
00:17:01.058 --> 00:17:03.662
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

137
00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:05.250
Well, it...

138
00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.102
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

139
00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:09.495
The Lost Ark?

140
00:17:09.684 --> 00:17:12.238
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.
The chest the Hebrews used

141
00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.878
- to carry around the Ten Commandments.
- What do you mean, "commandments"?

142
00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.462
You talking about the Ten Commandments?

143
00:17:16.486 --> 00:17:18.436
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments.

144
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:19.962
The original stone tablets

145
00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:22.348
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

146
00:17:22.373 --> 00:17:24.181
if you believe in that sort of thing.

147
00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:27.161
Any of you guys ever
go to Sunday school?

148
00:17:27.238 --> 00:17:28.805
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

149
00:17:29.217 --> 00:17:30.967
The Hebrews took the broken pieces

150
00:17:30.992 --> 00:17:33.279
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

151
00:17:33.645 --> 00:17:36.147
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

152
00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:38.798
- In Jerusalem.
- Where it stayed for many years.

153
00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:41.025
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

154
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.217
Where?

155
00:17:42.242 --> 00:17:44.045
Well, nobody knows where or when.

156
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.947
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

157
00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:47.108
- Shishak.
- Yes.

158
00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:50.098
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

159
00:17:50.123 --> 00:17:53.084
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

160
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:56.568
and hidden it in a secret chamber
called the Well of Souls.

161
00:17:57.152 --> 00:17:58.321
Secret chamber?

162
00:17:58.346 --> 00:18:01.999
However, about a year after
the pharaoh would return to Egypt,

163
00:18:02.024 --> 00:18:05.219
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

164
00:18:05.244 --> 00:18:07.939
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

165
00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:10.888
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

166
00:18:14.651 --> 00:18:16.361
Obviously, we've come to the right men.

167
00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:17.929
Now you seem to know, uh,

168
00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:19.578
all about this Tanis, then.

169
00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:21.015
No, no, not really.

170
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.064
Ravenwood is the real expert.

171
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:25.499
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

172
00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:27.325
Collected some of its relics.

173
00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.181
It was his obsession, really.

174
00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:32.568
But he never found the city.

175
00:18:32.593 --> 00:18:35.929
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

176
00:18:35.954 --> 00:18:38.208
An American being mentioned
so prominently

177
00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:39.893
in a secret Nazi cable.

178
00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:42.254
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

179
00:18:42.499 --> 00:18:44.599
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

180
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.583
Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking

181
00:18:46.608 --> 00:18:48.603
for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra

182
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.483
and they think Abner's got it.

183
00:18:50.832 --> 00:18:53.502
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

184
00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:56.563
Well, the staff is just a stick...
I don't know, about this big,

185
00:18:56.696 --> 00:18:58.322
nobody really knows for sure how high...

186
00:18:58.347 --> 00:19:01.349
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

187
00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.367
with an elaborate headpiece

188
00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:06.647
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

189
00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:08.621
And what you did was

190
00:19:08.646 --> 00:19:11.398
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

191
00:19:11.507 --> 00:19:14.694
A map room with a miniature
of the city all laid out on the floor,

192
00:19:14.719 --> 00:19:16.548
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

193
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.451
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

194
00:19:19.476 --> 00:19:22.867
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here,

195
00:19:23.451 --> 00:19:26.370
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

196
00:19:26.622 --> 00:19:28.872
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

197
00:19:28.897 --> 00:19:31.107
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

198
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:33.112
What does this Ark look like?

199
00:19:35.444 --> 00:19:37.321
There's a picture of it right here.

200
00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:42.634
That's it.

201
00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.007
Good God.

202
00:19:51.161 --> 00:19:53.622
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

203
00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:57.379
Now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

204
00:19:57.523 --> 00:19:58.936
Lightning,

205
00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:00.749
fire,

206
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.236
power of God or something.

207
00:20:05.323 --> 00:20:07.867
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.

208
00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:09.279
Oh, yes.

209
00:20:09.356 --> 00:20:11.524
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

210
00:20:11.608 --> 00:20:14.089
and laying waste to entire regions.

211
00:20:15.302 --> 00:20:17.795
An army which carries the Ark before it

212
00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:20.724
is invincible.

213
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.140
You did it, didn't you?

214
00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:45.136
They want you to go for it.

215
00:20:45.274 --> 00:20:46.853
Oh, Marcus!

216
00:20:47.425 --> 00:20:50.532
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

217
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.712
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

218
00:20:52.737 --> 00:20:53.905
And the museum?

219
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.273
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

220
00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:56.637
Oh, yes.

221
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:02.949
The Ark of the Covenant.

222
00:21:03.356 --> 00:21:05.230
Nothing else has come close.

223
00:21:06.103 --> 00:21:09.883
That thing represents everything we got
into archaeology for in the first place.

224
00:21:13.724 --> 00:21:16.226
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

225
00:21:16.432 --> 00:21:17.990
I'm really rather envious.

226
00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:20.510
I've got to locate Abner.

227
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:22.560
I think I know where to start.

228
00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:29.354
Suppose she'll still be with him?

229
00:21:29.854 --> 00:21:31.314
Possibly, but...

230
00:21:31.701 --> 00:21:33.619
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

231
00:21:33.644 --> 00:21:35.074
believe me, Indy.

232
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.094
What do you mean?

233
00:21:37.534 --> 00:21:40.250
Well,
I mean that for nearly 3,000 years,

234
00:21:40.275 --> 00:21:43.074
man has been searching for the Lost Ark.

235
00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:46.560
Not something to be taken lightly.

236
00:21:48.384 --> 00:21:50.193
No one knows its secrets.

237
00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:55.316
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

238
00:21:56.436 --> 00:21:57.893
Oh, Marcus.

239
00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:00.621
What are you trying to do, scare me?
You sound like my mother.

240
00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:02.082
We've known each other for a long time.

241
00:22:02.106 --> 00:22:05.123
I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

242
00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:08.737
I'm going after a find
of incredible historical significance.

243
00:22:08.762 --> 00:22:10.536
You're talking about the bogeyman.

244
00:22:10.707 --> 00:22:13.529
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

245
00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:25.813
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

246
00:22:25.838 --> 00:22:26.839
Thank you.

247
00:24:32.344 --> 00:24:34.053
Give him space!
Give him space!

248
00:24:34.091 --> 00:24:35.551
Go on, Regan!

249
00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:27.579
Hello, Marion.

250
00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:36.118
Indiana Jones.

251
00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:42.850
Always knew, someday,
you'd come walking back through my door.

252
00:25:43.596 --> 00:25:45.162
I never doubted that.

253
00:25:45.296 --> 00:25:47.203
Something made it inevitable.

254
00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:50.126
So, what are you doing here in Nepal?

255
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.754
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

256
00:25:53.374 --> 00:25:55.620
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

257
00:25:57.728 --> 00:25:59.062
I never meant to hurt you.

258
00:25:59.093 --> 00:26:01.326
I was a child.
I was in love.

259
00:26:01.699 --> 00:26:03.180
It was wrong and you knew it!

260
00:26:03.386 --> 00:26:04.615
You knew what you were doing.

261
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.266
Now I do!
This is my place.

262
00:26:06.683 --> 00:26:07.684
Get out!

263
00:26:10.997 --> 00:26:13.250
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it,

264
00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:15.374
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

265
00:26:17.217 --> 00:26:19.112
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

266
00:26:19.223 --> 00:26:22.616
Bronze piece, about this size, with a
hole in it, off-center, with a crystal.

267
00:26:22.829 --> 00:26:25.289
- You know the one I mean?
- Yeah.

268
00:26:25.755 --> 00:26:26.901
I know it.

269
00:26:27.228 --> 00:26:28.721
Where's Abner?

270
00:26:29.168 --> 00:26:30.635
Where's Abner?

271
00:26:31.593 --> 00:26:32.803
Abner's dead.

272
00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.589
Marion, I'm sorry.

273
00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:43.303
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

274
00:26:43.328 --> 00:26:45.385
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.

275
00:26:45.728 --> 00:26:47.562
Well, say it again, anyway.

276
00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:48.948
Sorry.

277
00:26:48.973 --> 00:26:51.100
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

278
00:26:51.493 --> 00:26:53.206
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

279
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.898
looking for his little bits of junk.

280
00:26:54.923 --> 00:26:57.259
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

281
00:26:58.268 --> 00:27:00.361
Everybody's sorry for something.

282
00:27:00.676 --> 00:27:02.661
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

283
00:27:02.692 --> 00:27:04.872
- You going to give it to me?
- Maybe.

284
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:06.701
I don't know where it is.

285
00:27:06.824 --> 00:27:09.453
Well, maybe you could find it.

286
00:27:10.439 --> 00:27:11.979
3,000 bucks.

287
00:27:13.627 --> 00:27:17.147
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

288
00:27:17.654 --> 00:27:19.814
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

289
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.660
It's important, Marion.

290
00:27:23.247 --> 00:27:24.498
Trust me.

291
00:27:26.275 --> 00:27:27.526
You know the piece I mean?

292
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:28.861
Do you know where it is?

293
00:27:32.627 --> 00:27:33.753
Come back tomorrow.

294
00:27:35.383 --> 00:27:36.384
Why?

295
00:27:36.713 --> 00:27:38.887
Because I said so, that's why.

296
00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:49.662
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

297
00:28:58.008 --> 00:28:59.940
Good evening, <i>Fräulein.</i>

298
00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:01.495
The bar's closed.

299
00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:04.648
We... We are

300
00:29:05.108 --> 00:29:06.528
not thirsty.

301
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.719
What do you want?

302
00:29:08.844 --> 00:29:11.510
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

303
00:29:11.594 --> 00:29:13.887
Surely he told you there would be

304
00:29:13.912 --> 00:29:15.696
other interested parties.

305
00:29:16.282 --> 00:29:18.089
Must've slipped his mind.

306
00:29:18.914 --> 00:29:21.316
The man is... nefarious.

307
00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:25.966
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

308
00:29:26.618 --> 00:29:28.500
Why, are you willing to offer more?

309
00:29:29.094 --> 00:29:30.880
Oh, almost certainly.

310
00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.662
Do you still have it?

311
00:29:39.442 --> 00:29:40.669
No.

312
00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:43.242
But I know where it is.

313
00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:47.354
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

314
00:29:47.608 --> 00:29:51.688
Your fire is dying here.

315
00:29:52.682 --> 00:29:55.495
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

316
00:29:55.812 --> 00:29:57.689
Listen, <i>Herr</i> Mac...

317
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.607
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

318
00:30:02.364 --> 00:30:04.777
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

319
00:30:05.124 --> 00:30:06.971
<i>Fräulein</i> Ravenwood,

320
00:30:08.042 --> 00:30:11.428
let me show you what I am used to.

321
00:30:14.785 --> 00:30:17.664
Take your hands off me!

322
00:30:19.483 --> 00:30:21.652
Take your lousy hands off!

323
00:30:28.463 --> 00:30:30.864
Wait a minute.
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

324
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:32.473
That time is passed.

325
00:30:33.002 --> 00:30:34.477
You don't need that.

326
00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:37.712
Wait...

327
00:30:39.422 --> 00:30:41.249
I'll tell you everything.

328
00:30:41.581 --> 00:30:44.417
Yes, I know you will.

329
00:30:51.143 --> 00:30:52.144
Let her go.

330
00:32:07.053 --> 00:32:08.054
Whiskey.

331
00:32:17.221 --> 00:32:18.347
Shoot them.

332
00:32:19.014 --> 00:32:20.224
Shoot them both.

333
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.538
My medallion!

334
00:33:24.214 --> 00:33:26.674
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

335
00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:28.492
how to show a lady a good time!

336
00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:31.544
- Boy, you're something!
- Yeah, I'll tell you what.

337
00:33:31.628 --> 00:33:33.421
Until I get back my $5,000,

338
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:35.531
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

339
00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:38.015
I'm your goddamn partner!

340
00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:18.152
Cairo, city of the living.

341
00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:20.153
A paradise on earth.

342
00:34:21.973 --> 00:34:23.140
Silence!

343
00:34:23.165 --> 00:34:24.666
Why do you forget yourselves?

344
00:34:24.863 --> 00:34:26.280
What is this?

345
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:28.185
Where did this animal come from?

346
00:34:31.647 --> 00:34:32.967
Oh... oh, no.

347
00:34:35.984 --> 00:34:37.151
Cute.

348
00:34:37.235 --> 00:34:39.029
What an adorable creature.

349
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.283
Then it shall be welcome in our house.

350
00:34:43.308 --> 00:34:46.082
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

351
00:34:53.835 --> 00:34:56.255
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

352
00:34:56.505 --> 00:34:58.288
You're the best digger in Egypt.

353
00:34:58.842 --> 00:35:01.655
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

354
00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:05.013
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

355
00:35:05.051 --> 00:35:06.802
The excavation is enormous.

356
00:35:08.033 --> 00:35:11.080
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

357
00:35:11.886 --> 00:35:14.189
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.

358
00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:16.053
When did they find the map room?

359
00:35:16.358 --> 00:35:17.692
Three days ago.

360
00:35:17.717 --> 00:35:19.598
They have not one brain among them.

361
00:35:20.158 --> 00:35:21.611
Except one.

362
00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:24.495
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

363
00:35:26.736 --> 00:35:29.116
- What's his name?
- They call him "Bellosh."

364
00:35:36.086 --> 00:35:38.132
Belloq. Belloq.

365
00:35:39.115 --> 00:35:41.609
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

366
00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:44.507
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

367
00:35:44.886 --> 00:35:47.986
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

368
00:35:50.164 --> 00:35:52.131
Who can tell us about these markings?

369
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:56.963
Perhaps a man I know can help us.

370
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.617
Indy,

371
00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.200
there is something that troubles me.

372
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.026
What is it?

373
00:36:07.826 --> 00:36:09.179
The Ark.

374
00:36:09.757 --> 00:36:11.639
If it is there, at Tanis,

375
00:36:12.195 --> 00:36:14.935
then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.

376
00:36:15.602 --> 00:36:17.575
Death has always surrounded it.

377
00:36:18.867 --> 00:36:20.435
It is not of this earth.

378
00:36:21.036 --> 00:36:22.526
Do we need the monkey, huh?

379
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:24.010
I'm surprised at you, Jones,

380
00:36:24.035 --> 00:36:26.242
talking that way about our baby.

381
00:36:27.004 --> 00:36:28.588
He's got your looks, too.

382
00:36:28.805 --> 00:36:30.010
And your brains.

383
00:36:31.601 --> 00:36:32.685
I noticed that.

384
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.061
She's a smart little thing.
Smart.

385
00:36:38.964 --> 00:36:40.497
Hey, where you going?

386
00:36:40.676 --> 00:36:42.370
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

387
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:47.657
Come on. Come on.

388
00:36:47.682 --> 00:36:49.397
- Okay...
- Marion.

389
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.623
- What's this?
- It's a date.

390
00:36:52.078 --> 00:36:53.288
You eat 'em.

391
00:37:42.504 --> 00:37:44.941
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

392
00:37:44.965 --> 00:37:46.902
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

393
00:37:46.926 --> 00:37:48.110
Who says I haven't?

394
00:37:49.886 --> 00:37:50.971
I do.

395
00:37:51.129 --> 00:37:52.929
Dad had you figured a long time ago.

396
00:38:02.158 --> 00:38:03.534
He said you were a bum.

397
00:38:03.671 --> 00:38:05.005
Oh, he's being generous.

398
00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:07.099
The most gifted bum he ever trained.

399
00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:09.329
You know, he loved you like a son.

400
00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:11.018
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

401
00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:12.210
Not much, just you.

402
00:38:30.594 --> 00:38:31.887
Marion, get out of here!

403
00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:33.370
Duck!

404
00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.638
Right.

405
00:40:04.809 --> 00:40:06.010
Marion!

406
00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:28.500
Help! Over here, Indy!

407
00:40:28.858 --> 00:40:29.900
Get out of the way!

408
00:40:29.925 --> 00:40:31.384
Move! Move it!

409
00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:33.625
Help me!

410
00:40:39.425 --> 00:40:40.718
You can't do this to me!

411
00:40:40.743 --> 00:40:42.345
I'm an American!

412
00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:44.943
Indy!

413
00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:49.474
Indiana Jones!

414
00:40:49.659 --> 00:40:50.993
Help me, Jones!

415
00:41:12.331 --> 00:41:13.499
Jones!

416
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:14.610
Marion!

417
00:41:18.028 --> 00:41:20.197
Indy!

418
00:42:02.054 --> 00:42:03.374
Marion...

419
00:42:41.163 --> 00:42:42.248
Dr. Jones.

420
00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:10.951
You looking for me?

421
00:43:20.438 --> 00:43:22.871
- Belloq.
- Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

422
00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:24.831
I ought to kill you right now.

423
00:43:25.028 --> 00:43:27.372
Not a very private place for a murder.

424
00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.355
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

425
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.743
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

426
00:43:34.828 --> 00:43:37.260
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

427
00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:39.429
Please, sit down before you fall down.

428
00:43:39.706 --> 00:43:41.968
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

429
00:43:53.485 --> 00:43:56.118
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

430
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:58.490
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

431
00:43:58.515 --> 00:44:01.271
after so many stimulating encounters.

432
00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.224
I almost regret it.

433
00:44:03.662 --> 00:44:06.832
Where shall I find a new adversary
so close to my own level?

434
00:44:07.097 --> 00:44:08.942
Try the local sewer.

435
00:44:11.685 --> 00:44:13.651
You and I are very much alike.

436
00:44:15.013 --> 00:44:16.940
Archaeology is our religion,

437
00:44:17.473 --> 00:44:20.240
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

438
00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:24.613
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

439
00:44:25.279 --> 00:44:27.826
I am a shadowy reflection of you.

440
00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:31.492
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

441
00:44:31.665 --> 00:44:33.718
to push you out of the light.

442
00:44:34.026 --> 00:44:35.872
Now you're getting nasty.

443
00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:39.255
You know it's true.

444
00:44:39.649 --> 00:44:41.055
How nice.

445
00:44:41.617 --> 00:44:43.023
Look at this.

446
00:44:43.702 --> 00:44:45.063
It's worthless.

447
00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:47.831
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.

448
00:44:48.021 --> 00:44:50.804
But I take it, I bury it in the
sand for a thousand years,

449
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:52.469
it becomes priceless...

450
00:44:53.012 --> 00:44:54.295
Like the Ark.

451
00:44:54.752 --> 00:44:56.423
Men will kill for it.

452
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:58.859
Men like you and me.

453
00:44:59.498 --> 00:45:02.451
What about your boss, <i>der Führer?</i>

454
00:45:03.065 --> 00:45:05.778
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

455
00:45:06.585 --> 00:45:08.158
All in good time.

456
00:45:09.019 --> 00:45:10.878
When I am finished with it.

457
00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:14.392
Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?

458
00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:16.519
It's a transmitter.

459
00:45:16.945 --> 00:45:19.613
It's a radio for speaking to God.

460
00:45:19.877 --> 00:45:21.739
And it's within my reach.

461
00:45:23.476 --> 00:45:25.236
You want to talk to God?

462
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.878
Let's go see Him together.

463
00:45:29.105 --> 00:45:30.732
I've got nothing better to do.

464
00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:34.028
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

465
00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:37.209
Uncle Indy!

466
00:45:38.757 --> 00:45:40.317
Next time, Indiana Jones,

467
00:45:40.342 --> 00:45:42.510
it'll take more than children
to save you.

468
00:45:44.526 --> 00:45:45.694
Uncle Indy!

469
00:45:59.691 --> 00:46:01.276
I thought I would find you there.

470
00:46:01.567 --> 00:46:03.819
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

471
00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.340
Marion's dead.

472
00:46:15.365 --> 00:46:17.730
- Yes, I know.
- And me! And me!

473
00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.279
I'm sorry.

474
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.593
Life goes on, Indy.

475
00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:23.869
There is the proof.

476
00:46:27.372 --> 00:46:29.015
I have much to tell you.

477
00:46:29.252 --> 00:46:30.952
First we will take them home,

478
00:46:31.435 --> 00:46:33.265
and then I will take you to the old man.

479
00:47:24.182 --> 00:47:26.156
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.

480
00:47:26.455 --> 00:47:28.302
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?

481
00:47:28.702 --> 00:47:30.062
There are no pictures,

482
00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:32.217
no duplicates of it anywhere.

483
00:47:32.242 --> 00:47:34.497
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

484
00:47:34.695 --> 00:47:36.166
A headpiece like that one,

485
00:47:36.488 --> 00:47:38.811
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

486
00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:40.938
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

487
00:47:40.963 --> 00:47:45.384
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

488
00:47:45.615 --> 00:47:47.815
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

489
00:47:50.315 --> 00:47:52.307
They made their calculations
in the map room?

490
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:53.727
This morning.

491
00:47:53.884 --> 00:47:56.261
Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.

492
00:47:57.796 --> 00:48:01.232
When they came out of the map room,
they gave us a new spot in which to dig,

493
00:48:01.376 --> 00:48:03.083
out away from the camp.

494
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:06.112
The Well of the Souls, huh?

495
00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:09.489
Come, come, look.
Look here... Look.

496
00:48:10.117 --> 00:48:11.537
Sit down.

497
00:48:11.802 --> 00:48:13.303
Come, sit down.

498
00:48:13.387 --> 00:48:14.623
What is it?

499
00:48:15.784 --> 00:48:17.424
This is a warning

500
00:48:17.637 --> 00:48:20.177
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.

501
00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.212
What about the height
of the staff, though?

502
00:48:22.236 --> 00:48:23.372
Did Belloq get it off of here?

503
00:48:23.396 --> 00:48:25.070
Yes. It is here.

504
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.390
This were the old way,

505
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.820
this mean six <i>kadam</i> high.

506
00:48:29.845 --> 00:48:31.095
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

507
00:48:34.659 --> 00:48:37.494
"And take back one <i>kadam</i>

508
00:48:37.579 --> 00:48:41.553
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."

509
00:48:53.752 --> 00:48:55.643
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

510
00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:57.291
Are you absolutely sure?

511
00:48:59.507 --> 00:49:01.114
Belloq's staff is too long.

512
00:49:01.848 --> 00:49:03.921
They're digging in the wrong place.

513
00:49:06.528 --> 00:49:09.121
<i>I am the monarch of the sea</i>

514
00:49:09.387 --> 00:49:11.101
<i>I am the ruler of the...</i>

515
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.236
Bad dates.

516
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.707
I told you not to be premature

517
00:49:40.732 --> 00:49:42.593
in your communiquė to Berlin.

518
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.067
Archaeology is not an exact science.

519
00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:49.257
It does not deal in time schedules.

520
00:49:49.475 --> 00:49:51.026
The <i>Führer</i> is not a patient man.

521
00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:54.262
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

522
00:49:54.287 --> 00:49:55.489
You led me to believe...

523
00:49:55.514 --> 00:49:57.307
Nothing!
I made no promises.

524
00:49:57.424 --> 00:49:59.538
I only said it looked very favorable.

525
00:49:59.885 --> 00:50:02.687
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

526
00:50:02.771 --> 00:50:04.356
my calculations were correct.

527
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.685
Boy, they're not kidding, are they?

528
00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:10.445
What time does the sun hit the map room?

529
00:50:10.588 --> 00:50:12.358
At about 9:00 in the morning.

530
00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:14.365
Not much time, then.

531
00:50:14.572 --> 00:50:16.677
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

532
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:19.746
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

533
00:50:19.903 --> 00:50:21.237
Let's go, come on.

534
00:54:27.803 --> 00:54:29.136
Sallah.

535
00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:31.942
Sallah!

536
00:54:40.036 --> 00:54:41.078
They're here.

537
00:54:52.063 --> 00:54:53.412
Please, my friend, what is the matter?

538
00:54:53.436 --> 00:54:55.486
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

539
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:59.544
If you want water, I will get you water.

540
00:54:59.568 --> 00:55:00.860
No problem, no problem.

541
00:55:15.667 --> 00:55:17.093
I thought you were dead.

542
00:55:17.348 --> 00:55:18.898
You must have switched baskets.

543
00:55:23.488 --> 00:55:24.641
Are you hurt?

544
00:55:24.666 --> 00:55:26.761
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

545
00:55:26.904 --> 00:55:28.719
They're gonna be back at any minute.

546
00:55:28.986 --> 00:55:31.474
Cut me loose.
Quick.

547
00:55:31.558 --> 00:55:34.006
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

548
00:55:38.793 --> 00:55:41.219
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.

549
00:55:41.244 --> 00:55:42.620
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

550
00:55:42.932 --> 00:55:43.975
The Ark's here?

551
00:55:44.988 --> 00:55:46.674
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

552
00:55:46.698 --> 00:55:48.092
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

553
00:55:48.116 --> 00:55:50.803
If I take you out of here now,
they'll start combing the place for us.

554
00:55:50.827 --> 00:55:52.426
Jones, you've got to get me out of here!

555
00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:54.828
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?

556
00:55:55.631 --> 00:55:57.076
Marion, I hate to do this,

557
00:55:57.101 --> 00:55:59.859
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

558
00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:01.969
this whole thing is going to be shot.

559
00:56:03.048 --> 00:56:04.466
I'll be back to get you.

560
00:56:05.059 --> 00:56:06.519
Jones, what's the matter?

561
00:56:52.304 --> 00:56:53.737
That's it.

562
00:56:54.616 --> 00:56:55.676
Who knows?

563
00:56:55.701 --> 00:56:57.410
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

564
00:56:57.435 --> 00:56:59.803
in some antechamber for us to discover.

565
00:57:00.464 --> 00:57:03.231
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

566
00:57:03.666 --> 00:57:05.819
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps the girl can help us.

567
00:57:05.997 --> 00:57:07.472
My feeling exactly.

568
00:57:07.979 --> 00:57:10.122
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

569
00:57:10.147 --> 00:57:12.816
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

570
00:57:13.655 --> 00:57:15.405
I tell you, the girl knows nothing.

571
00:57:16.513 --> 00:57:18.223
I'm surprised to find you squeamish.

572
00:57:18.248 --> 00:57:20.040
That is not your reputation.

573
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.830
But it needn't concern you.

574
00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:24.065
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

575
00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:30.969
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

576
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:52.882
Indy! Here!

577
00:58:52.907 --> 00:58:54.283
We've hit stone!

578
00:58:58.738 --> 00:59:00.155
Clear it off.

579
00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.557
Come on, find the edges.

580
00:59:18.245 --> 00:59:19.871
Good, good, good.

581
00:59:19.896 --> 00:59:21.188
You see, Indy? You see?

582
00:59:21.213 --> 00:59:23.132
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

583
00:59:23.157 --> 00:59:24.742
As a team, boys! As a team!

584
00:59:26.953 --> 00:59:28.079
Push!

585
00:59:31.816 --> 00:59:33.651
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.

586
00:59:33.676 --> 00:59:34.885
Good, good, that's it.

587
00:59:35.467 --> 00:59:36.552
Watch your toes.

588
00:59:44.253 --> 00:59:45.774
Carefully, carefully!

589
00:59:52.186 --> 00:59:53.646
Sorry, Indy.

590
01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.105
Snakes.

591
01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.614
Why did it have to be snakes?

592
01:00:29.904 --> 01:00:31.325
Very dangerous.

593
01:00:32.815 --> 01:00:34.233
You go first.

594
01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:55.653
If you're trying to escape on foot,

595
01:00:55.737 --> 01:00:58.241
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

596
01:00:58.526 --> 01:01:00.154
so please, eat something.

597
01:01:07.708 --> 01:01:09.751
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

598
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:12.212
Yeah. Whose idea was it?
No food, no water.

599
01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:14.707
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

600
01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:17.133
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

601
01:01:17.158 --> 01:01:19.160
they are necessary evils.

602
01:01:19.347 --> 01:01:20.929
They're not my friends.

603
01:01:21.013 --> 01:01:23.774
However, with the right connections,

604
01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:27.914
even in this part of the world,
we are not entirely uncivilized.

605
01:01:30.182 --> 01:01:31.183
It's beautiful.

606
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.291
I would very much like to see you in it.

607
01:01:36.824 --> 01:01:38.303
I'll bet you would.

608
01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:44.397
All right.

609
01:01:52.613 --> 01:01:54.366
What do you got to drink around here?

610
01:01:57.427 --> 01:01:59.180
We don't have much time.

611
01:01:59.594 --> 01:02:01.236
Soon they will come to harm you,

612
01:02:01.261 --> 01:02:03.346
and I will not be able to stop them,

613
01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:06.099
unless you are able to give me something

614
01:02:06.124 --> 01:02:07.667
to placate them.

615
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.980
Some, uh, piece of information

616
01:02:11.874 --> 01:02:14.181
which I can use to
protect you from them.

617
01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:16.608
I've already told you everything I know.

618
01:02:16.637 --> 01:02:18.555
I have no loyalty to Jones.

619
01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:21.072
He's brought me nothing but trouble.

620
01:02:28.288 --> 01:02:29.790
Marion, you are beautiful.

621
01:02:35.254 --> 01:02:36.964
I don't think we need a chaperone.

622
01:02:41.493 --> 01:02:42.952
Steadily.

623
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:44.528
Steadily. Whoa!

624
01:02:47.233 --> 01:02:48.360
Down...

625
01:02:48.576 --> 01:02:49.660
Down... Whoa.

626
01:02:49.685 --> 01:02:50.879
Carefully, carefully!

627
01:02:51.738 --> 01:02:52.989
You all right, Indy?

628
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:58.970
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

629
01:03:19.443 --> 01:03:21.043
I told you it will be all right.

630
01:03:47.427 --> 01:03:49.054
Sallah, get down here!

631
01:04:06.873 --> 01:04:08.240
You pour.

632
01:06:02.053 --> 01:06:03.680
Oh, that's good.

633
01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:16.777
What is this stuff, Renė?

634
01:06:18.138 --> 01:06:19.639
I grew up with this.

635
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.462
It's my family label.

636
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.516
Well... I have to be
going now, Renė.

637
01:06:57.851 --> 01:06:59.931
I like you, Renė, very much.

638
01:07:00.508 --> 01:07:03.178
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

639
01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:09.777
We meet again, <i>Fräulein.</i>

640
01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:13.467
You Americans, you're all the same.

641
01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:18.211
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

642
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.264
Now...

643
01:07:54.397 --> 01:07:56.397
what shall we talk about?

644
01:09:14.602 --> 01:09:17.063
All right... take it up!

645
01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:18.915
Easy!

646
01:09:21.088 --> 01:09:22.648
You're as stubborn as that girl.

647
01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:25.342
You like her too much, I think.

648
01:09:25.608 --> 01:09:28.793
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

649
01:09:29.155 --> 01:09:33.945
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... china cup.

650
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:40.639
Colonel! Wake your men!

651
01:09:40.823 --> 01:09:42.783
Indy, the torches are burning out.

652
01:09:43.121 --> 01:09:44.731
Go on, get out of here.

653
01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:06.661
- Sallah!
- Hello!

654
01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:09.054
Hello!

655
01:10:09.763 --> 01:10:11.895
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

656
01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.797
in such a nasty place?

657
01:10:14.116 --> 01:10:15.965
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

658
01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:19.915
Thank you, my friend, but I think
we are all very comfortable up here.

659
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:21.554
That's right, isn't it?

660
01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:24.678
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.

661
01:10:25.909 --> 01:10:27.709
So, once again, Jones,

662
01:10:27.927 --> 01:10:30.289
what was briefly yours is now mine.

663
01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:34.139
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

664
01:10:34.666 --> 01:10:37.912
You're about to become a permanent
addition to this archaeological find.

665
01:10:38.726 --> 01:10:39.760
Who knows?

666
01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:42.385
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

667
01:10:43.912 --> 01:10:45.262
Son of a bitch.

668
01:10:45.287 --> 01:10:47.513
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

669
01:10:47.538 --> 01:10:49.624
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

670
01:10:50.085 --> 01:10:53.603
But I do not wish to leave you
down in that awful place all alone.

671
01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:55.638
Slimy pig, you let me go!

672
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:57.466
Stop it!

673
01:11:00.243 --> 01:11:01.650
Marion!

674
01:11:02.243 --> 01:11:03.244
Hang on.

675
01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:05.324
Don't...

676
01:11:05.449 --> 01:11:06.491
- Indy!
- Don't fall!

677
01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:08.518
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

678
01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:15.349
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

679
01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:24.461
Snakes!

680
01:11:25.783 --> 01:11:28.049
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

681
01:11:28.931 --> 01:11:30.098
The girl was mine!

682
01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:31.161
She's of no use to us.

683
01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.186
Only our mission for the <i>Führer</i> matters.

684
01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:39.259
I wonder sometimes, <i>monsieur,</i>
if you have that clearly in mind.

685
01:11:40.376 --> 01:11:42.032
It was not to be, <i>chérie.</i>

686
01:11:42.861 --> 01:11:45.102
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

687
01:11:45.202 --> 01:11:46.682
Indiana Jones,

688
01:11:47.959 --> 01:11:48.960
<i>adieu.</i>

689
01:12:01.829 --> 01:12:03.248
No!

690
01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:14.023
Take this.

691
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.786
Wave it at anything that slithers.

692
01:12:15.897 --> 01:12:17.064
Thank you.

693
01:12:17.162 --> 01:12:19.498
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

694
01:12:22.616 --> 01:12:25.064
- Indy!
- Ow! Jesus!

695
01:12:28.823 --> 01:12:30.492
Where did you get this?
From him?

696
01:12:30.517 --> 01:12:33.245
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.

697
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.873
- How hard were you trying?
- Well, where the hell were you?

698
01:12:35.897 --> 01:12:37.040
Watch it, watch it.

699
01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:39.410
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!

700
01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:43.881
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

701
01:12:43.905 --> 01:12:45.198
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

702
01:12:45.222 --> 01:12:47.272
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

703
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:54.635
Where are you going?

704
01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.078
Through that wall.

705
01:12:56.892 --> 01:12:58.895
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

706
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.547
What do you mean by that?

707
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.187
Indy!

708
01:13:14.837 --> 01:13:17.298
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

709
01:13:41.796 --> 01:13:43.182
Indy!

710
01:13:43.632 --> 01:13:44.799
Here we go!

711
01:13:45.115 --> 01:13:46.282
Get ready!

712
01:13:46.356 --> 01:13:50.013
Indy, the torch is going out!

713
01:14:31.187 --> 01:14:32.522
Indy?

714
01:14:52.735 --> 01:14:54.241
Marion!

715
01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:56.781
Look. Look.

716
01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:37.479
They're going to fly it out of here.

717
01:15:38.146 --> 01:15:41.114
When that Ark gets loaded,
we're already going to be on the plane.

718
01:15:45.429 --> 01:15:49.123
Ah, <i>monsieur,</i> let us toast
our success in the desert.

719
01:15:49.576 --> 01:15:52.426
- To the Ark.
- When we are very far from here.

720
01:15:52.937 --> 01:15:54.409
That will do.

721
01:16:46.647 --> 01:16:49.787
Hey, you now... Come here!

722
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:52.410
Come here!

723
01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.049
Indy!

724
01:18:50.007 --> 01:18:52.092
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

725
01:18:57.752 --> 01:18:59.086
Look out!

726
01:19:09.516 --> 01:19:10.850
Oh, my God.

727
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:12.042
Marion.

728
01:19:12.067 --> 01:19:14.630
In here! Up here!

729
01:19:17.215 --> 01:19:19.235
- Indy, come on!
- Pull on the latch!

730
01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.568
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

731
01:19:24.065 --> 01:19:26.891
It's stuck! Indy!

732
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.435
I can't force the lock!

733
01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:00.174
It's stuck!

734
01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:01.675
- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!

735
01:20:01.759 --> 01:20:02.885
Turn it there!

736
01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:04.596
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

737
01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:26.735
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

738
01:20:26.878 --> 01:20:28.546
Have it put on the truck.

739
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.548
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

740
01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.658
And Gobler, I want plenty of protection.

741
01:20:40.082 --> 01:20:41.535
Jones.

742
01:20:47.148 --> 01:20:48.691
Holy smoke, my friends,

743
01:20:48.716 --> 01:20:51.075
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

744
01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:54.172
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

745
01:20:54.197 --> 01:20:55.573
If you still want the Ark,

746
01:20:55.598 --> 01:20:57.975
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

747
01:20:58.118 --> 01:20:59.408
Truck?

748
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.441
What truck?

749
01:21:28.878 --> 01:21:30.171
Let's go!

750
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.159
Get back to Cairo.

751
01:21:40.184 --> 01:21:42.141
Get us some transport to England

752
01:21:42.547 --> 01:21:44.967
boat, plane, anything.

753
01:21:45.604 --> 01:21:47.607
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.

754
01:21:47.632 --> 01:21:48.834
I'm going after that truck.

755
01:21:48.859 --> 01:21:50.402
- How?
- I don't know.

756
01:21:50.486 --> 01:21:51.836
I'm making this up as I go.

757
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.141
He's there!

758
01:28:46.256 --> 01:28:47.841
Idiot! Idiot!

759
01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:35.568
Everything at last has been arranged.

760
01:29:35.593 --> 01:29:37.135
- The Ark?
- Is on board.

761
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.870
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

762
01:29:38.954 --> 01:29:40.264
Or what is left of you.

763
01:29:40.289 --> 01:29:42.175
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

764
01:29:44.619 --> 01:29:46.079
Mr. Katanga.

765
01:29:49.715 --> 01:29:51.884
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

766
01:29:52.741 --> 01:29:54.295
They are my family.

767
01:29:54.575 --> 01:29:57.321
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

768
01:29:57.852 --> 01:29:59.719
My cabin is theirs.

769
01:30:00.199 --> 01:30:01.665
Mr. Jones...

770
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.440
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

771
01:30:04.813 --> 01:30:07.247
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

772
01:30:12.559 --> 01:30:13.986
Good-bye.

773
01:30:16.664 --> 01:30:18.264
Look after each other.

774
01:30:18.718 --> 01:30:20.511
I am already missing you.

775
01:30:23.069 --> 01:30:24.571
You're my good friend.

776
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.838
Sallah.

777
01:30:32.432 --> 01:30:33.905
That is for Fayah,

778
01:30:35.751 --> 01:30:37.112
that is for your children,

779
01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:38.805
and this is for you.

780
01:30:44.566 --> 01:30:45.900
Thank you.

781
01:30:54.974 --> 01:31:00.035
<i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>

782
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:04.281
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

783
01:31:04.618 --> 01:31:08.887
<i>His energetic fist should be ready to</i>

784
01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.759
<i>a dictator...</i>

785
01:31:19.148 --> 01:31:20.441
Where did you go?

786
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.364
I'm cleaning up.

787
01:31:24.115 --> 01:31:25.702
Where'd you get that?

788
01:31:26.245 --> 01:31:28.478
- From him.
- Who him?

789
01:31:28.689 --> 01:31:31.209
Katanga.
I got a feeling I'm not the first woman

790
01:31:31.233 --> 01:31:33.135
ever to travel with these pirates.

791
01:31:33.402 --> 01:31:34.868
It's lovely.

792
01:31:35.895 --> 01:31:37.681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
01:31:37.706 --> 01:31:38.748
Really?

794
01:31:39.136 --> 01:31:40.429
Yeah.

795
01:31:51.972 --> 01:31:53.265
What'd you say?

796
01:32:00.393 --> 01:32:02.437
Wait... I don't need any help.

797
01:32:02.708 --> 01:32:04.144
You know you do.

798
01:32:06.747 --> 01:32:08.907
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.

799
01:32:09.146 --> 01:32:12.566
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

800
01:32:17.952 --> 01:32:19.392
You are...

801
01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.344
Please, I don't need a nurse.

802
01:32:22.417 --> 01:32:23.895
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

803
01:32:23.919 --> 01:32:25.086
Marion, leave me alone.

804
01:32:25.111 --> 01:32:26.472
- What is this here?
- Go away.

805
01:32:26.625 --> 01:32:28.705
Yes, it hurts.

806
01:32:30.171 --> 01:32:32.611
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

807
01:32:34.037 --> 01:32:35.211
Here.

808
01:32:41.409 --> 01:32:42.749
Here.

809
01:32:51.674 --> 01:32:53.187
This isn't too bad.

810
01:33:03.043 --> 01:33:04.044
Here.

811
01:33:25.005 --> 01:33:26.006
Jones...

812
01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.155
Jones?

813
01:33:33.091 --> 01:33:35.134
We never seem to get a break, do we?

814
01:34:03.841 --> 01:34:04.842
What is it?

815
01:34:05.503 --> 01:34:07.588
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

816
01:34:18.732 --> 01:34:20.539
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

817
01:34:20.563 --> 01:34:21.986
Holy shit.

818
01:34:23.964 --> 01:34:26.133
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.

819
01:34:26.158 --> 01:34:27.635
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.

820
01:34:27.659 --> 01:34:29.009
Come on, go, my friend, go.

821
01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:44.838
- Where is Dr. Jones?
- What's the big idea?

822
01:34:45.132 --> 01:34:46.467
Let go!

823
01:34:50.938 --> 01:34:52.691
Don't you touch me.

824
01:35:37.496 --> 01:35:39.122
What about Jones?

825
01:35:39.147 --> 01:35:40.648
There's no trace yet, sir.

826
01:35:41.045 --> 01:35:42.421
Jones is dead.

827
01:35:45.604 --> 01:35:46.814
I killed him.

828
01:35:47.782 --> 01:35:49.116
He was of no use to us.

829
01:35:49.741 --> 01:35:52.667
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

830
01:35:53.425 --> 01:35:55.294
She'll bring a very good price.

831
01:35:58.590 --> 01:36:02.110
<i>Herr</i> Colonel, that cargo you've taken...

832
01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.089
If it's your goal, go in peace with it,
but leave us the girl.

833
01:36:05.114 --> 01:36:06.496
It would reduce our loss on this trip.

834
01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.866
Savage!

835
01:36:09.343 --> 01:36:11.656
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

836
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:13.863
We will take what we wish.

837
01:36:14.462 --> 01:36:17.811
And then decide whether or not
to blow your ship from the water.

838
01:36:20.272 --> 01:36:21.690
The girl goes with me.

839
01:36:23.076 --> 01:36:24.459
She'll be part of my compensation.

840
01:36:24.484 --> 01:36:26.775
I'm sure your <i>Führer</i> would approve.

841
01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:30.836
If she fails to please me,
you may do with her as you wish.

842
01:36:31.423 --> 01:36:33.736
I will waste no more time with her now.

843
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:35.456
Excuse me.

844
01:36:51.695 --> 01:36:53.196
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

845
01:36:53.221 --> 01:36:54.805
I've looked everywhere.

846
01:36:54.896 --> 01:36:56.849
He's got to be here somewhere.

847
01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.713
Look again.

848
01:37:00.729 --> 01:37:02.222
- I found him.
- Where?

849
01:37:02.515 --> 01:37:03.558
There.

850
01:39:29.372 --> 01:39:31.123
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

851
01:39:31.148 --> 01:39:32.524
with your radio instructions, sir.

852
01:39:32.549 --> 01:39:35.228
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.

853
01:39:37.742 --> 01:39:39.135
<i>Monsieur...</i>

854
01:39:41.114 --> 01:39:43.073
I am uncomfortable with the thought

855
01:39:43.098 --> 01:39:45.961
of this... Jewish ritual.

856
01:39:47.416 --> 01:39:49.098
Are you sure it's necessary?

857
01:39:49.997 --> 01:39:51.505
Let me ask you this:

858
01:39:52.063 --> 01:39:55.483
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

859
01:39:55.822 --> 01:39:57.248
for your <i>Führer?</i>

860
01:39:57.971 --> 01:40:01.917
Finding out, only then, if the sacred
pieces of the Covenant are inside?

861
01:40:02.292 --> 01:40:05.298
Knowing, only then, whether you
have accomplished your mission,

862
01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.405
and obtained the one true Ark?

863
01:41:37.018 --> 01:41:38.060
Hello!

864
01:41:41.022 --> 01:41:42.231
Jones.

865
01:41:43.391 --> 01:41:44.809
Jones!

866
01:41:44.834 --> 01:41:46.884
I'm going to blow up the Ark, Renė.

867
01:41:53.371 --> 01:41:56.011
Your persistence surprises even me.

868
01:41:57.472 --> 01:41:59.731
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

869
01:42:00.075 --> 01:42:01.471
Dr. Jones...

870
01:42:04.646 --> 01:42:07.190
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

871
01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:09.679
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

872
01:42:09.704 --> 01:42:11.081
All I want is the girl.

873
01:42:15.897 --> 01:42:17.440
If we refuse?

874
01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:20.336
Then your <i>Führer</i> has no prize.

875
01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:22.654
Okay, stand back.

876
01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:23.930
All of you, stand back.

877
01:42:23.955 --> 01:42:25.285
Stand back.

878
01:42:25.753 --> 01:42:27.072
Okay, Jones.

879
01:42:27.630 --> 01:42:28.925
You win!

880
01:42:30.113 --> 01:42:31.572
Blow it up.

881
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:38.950
Yes, blow it up!

882
01:42:40.828 --> 01:42:42.413
Blow it back to God.

883
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:47.081
All your life has been spent
in pursuit of archaeological relics.

884
01:42:47.656 --> 01:42:51.326
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

885
01:42:52.277 --> 01:42:54.404
You want to see it open as well as I.

886
01:42:56.552 --> 01:42:57.850
Indiana,

887
01:42:58.862 --> 01:43:01.197
we are simply passing through history.

888
01:43:03.228 --> 01:43:04.396
This...

889
01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:08.490
This is history.

890
01:43:18.515 --> 01:43:19.981
Do as you will.

891
01:45:55.525 --> 01:45:57.432
Marion, don't look at it.

892
01:45:57.782 --> 01:45:58.907
Shut your eyes, Marion.

893
01:45:58.932 --> 01:46:00.982
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

894
01:46:29.206 --> 01:46:30.874
It's beautiful!

895
01:46:41.733 --> 01:46:43.925
- Indy?
- Don't look, Marion!

896
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:45.202
Keep your eyes shut!

897
01:48:03.632 --> 01:48:04.800
Marion.

898
01:48:37.338 --> 01:48:40.232
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you.

899
01:48:40.643 --> 01:48:44.672
And we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

900
01:48:44.697 --> 01:48:45.781
Oh, the money's fine.

901
01:48:45.806 --> 01:48:47.474
The situation's totally unacceptable.

902
01:48:47.499 --> 01:48:50.017
Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.

903
01:48:50.042 --> 01:48:52.217
Where is the Ark?

904
01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:55.550
I thought we'd settled that.

905
01:48:55.778 --> 01:48:58.523
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

906
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:59.715
From whom?

907
01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:02.367
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power

908
01:49:02.392 --> 01:49:04.227
and it has to be researched.

909
01:49:04.330 --> 01:49:07.541
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

910
01:49:07.805 --> 01:49:09.225
Dr. Jones.

911
01:49:09.504 --> 01:49:12.678
We have top men working on it right now.

912
01:49:14.231 --> 01:49:15.441
Who?

913
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:19.003
Top men.

914
01:49:22.436 --> 01:49:24.137
Hey, what happened?

915
01:49:24.787 --> 01:49:25.923
You don't look very happy.

916
01:49:25.948 --> 01:49:28.784
- Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?

917
01:49:29.721 --> 01:49:31.567
They don't know what they've got there.

918
01:49:32.431 --> 01:49:34.260
Well, I know what I've got here.

919
01:49:35.601 --> 01:49:36.852
Come on.

920
01:49:37.181 --> 01:49:38.548
I'll buy you a drink.

921
01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:41.809
You know,

922
01:49:42.252 --> 01:49:43.643
a drink?
