1
00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:17.844
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.680
The poison is still fresh. Three days.
They're following us.

3
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.022
If they knew we were here,
they would have killed us already.

4
00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:57.152
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

5
00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:00.656
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor. He was good.

6
00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:06.574
- He was very, very good.
<i>- Señor,</i> nobody's come out alive.

7
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.248
Please.

8
00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.453
<i>Señor...</i>

9
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.818
Stop. Stay out of the light.

10
00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.009
Forrestal.

11
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.934
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

12
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:37.771
That's what scares me.

13
00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:59.084
- Stay here.
- If you insist, <i>señor.</i>

14
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.841
- Give me the whip.
- Throw me the idol.

15
00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:34.512
No time to argue.
Throw the idol, I throw the whip.

16
00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:37.265
- Give me the whip!
<i>- Adiós, señor.</i>

17
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:22.477
<i>Adiós.</i>

18
00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:07.727
Dr Jones, there is nothing you can
possess which I cannot take away.

19
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.068
And you thought I had given up.

20
00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:27.038
You chose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.

21
00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:33.919
Too bad the Hovitos don't know you
the way I do, Belloq.

22
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.050
Yes, too bad. You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

23
00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.939
Jock! Start the engines! Get it up!

24
00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:39.238
Jock, the engines!
Start the engines, Jock!

25
00:12:28.705 --> 00:12:31.708
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

26
00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:35.044
That's just my pet snake, Reggie.

27
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.339
I hate snakes, Jock. I hate them!

28
00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:41.509
Come on,
show a little backbone, will you!

29
00:12:57.901 --> 00:13:01.613
"Neo," meaning "new," and "lithic,"

30
00:13:01.697 --> 00:13:06.197
I-T-H-I-C, meaning "stone."

31
00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:09.621
Let's get back
to Turkdean barrow near Hazelton.

32
00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:14.205
It contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cists...

33
00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:22.049
Don't confuse that with robbing,

34
00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:26.220
which means the removal
of the barrow's contents.

35
00:13:26.346 --> 00:13:30.846
This site also demonstrates one
of the great dangers of archaeology,

36
00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:36.397
not to life and limb,
though that does happen, too.

37
00:13:36.523 --> 00:13:38.775
No, I'm talking about folklore.

38
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.400
Local tradition held that there was
a golden coffin buried at the site.

39
00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:48.572
This accounts for the holes dug all over
and the poor condition of the find.

40
00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:52.496
However, chamber 3 was undisturbed.

41
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:55.792
The undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods found

42
00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.960
in the area give us

43
00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:07.095
reason to date this find as we have.

44
00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:10.932
Any questions, then?

45
00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:13.894
No, okay. That's it for the day, then.

46
00:14:14.936 --> 00:14:19.436
Don't forget. Michaelson,
chapters four and five for next time.

47
00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:23.153
I will be in my office on Thursday,
but not Wednesday.

48
00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:35.832
I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.

49
00:14:35.957 --> 00:14:37.792
- What happened?
- Guess.

50
00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.838
- Belloq?
- Want to hear about it?

51
00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:45.049
No. I'm sure everything
you do for the museum

52
00:14:45.133 --> 00:14:48.511
conforms to the
Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.

53
00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:53.137
It's beautiful. I can get it. He can only
sell it in Marrakech. I need $2,000.

54
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.145
Listen, old boy,
I've brought some people to see you.

55
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.770
- I've got these pieces. Good pieces.
- Indiana...

56
00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:07.113
The museum will buy them, as usual.
Yes, they are nice.

57
00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:11.201
- Worth a ticket to Marrakech.
- The people are waiting.

58
00:15:11.326 --> 00:15:13.870
- What people?
- Army Intelligence.

59
00:15:13.995 --> 00:15:17.415
They knew you were coming.
They know everything.

60
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:21.503
- I don't know what they want.
- Why should I see them?

61
00:15:21.628 --> 00:15:23.296
Am I in trouble?

62
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.341
Dr Jones, we've heard a great deal
about you.

63
00:15:26.466 --> 00:15:27.925
Have you?

64
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:32.054
Professor of archaeology,
expert on the occult,

65
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.350
and how does one say it,
obtainer of rare antiquities.

66
00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:39.395
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?

67
00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:40.813
Thank you.

68
00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:44.233
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

69
00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:48.488
You studied under
Professor Ravenwood in Chicago?

70
00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:53.072
- Yes, I did.
- You've no idea of his whereabouts?

71
00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:58.373
Just rumours really.
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

72
00:15:58.498 --> 00:16:02.877
I haven't spoken to him for 10 years.
We were friends, but

73
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:06.548
had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.

74
00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:11.173
Dr Jones, you must understand
that this is all strictly confidential.

75
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.846
I understand.

76
00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:19.932
Yesterday, our European sections
intercepted a German communiquė

77
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.649
that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

78
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:29.233
The Nazis have teams of archaeologists
running around the world

79
00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:32.615
looking for religious artefacts.

80
00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:37.241
Hitler's a nut on the subject, crazy.
He's obsessed with the occult.

81
00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:42.246
There's a German archaeological dig
going on in the desert outside Cairo.

82
00:16:44.127 --> 00:16:48.381
We've got some information,
but we can't decipher it. Maybe you can.

83
00:16:49.424 --> 00:16:53.924
"Tanis development proceeding.
Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

84
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.225
"Abner Ravenwood, US."

85
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:02.394
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

86
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:05.648
What does Tanis mean to you?

87
00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:10.274
It's a possible resting place of
the Lost Ark. The Ark of the Covenant.

88
00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:15.032
The chest the Hebrews
carried the Ten Commandments in.

89
00:17:15.116 --> 00:17:19.616
- The Ten Commandments?
- The actual Commandments.

90
00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:24.084
The tablets Moses brought down
from Mount Horeb and smashed,

91
00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:26.836
if you believe in that sort of thing.

92
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:28.672
Ever go to Sunday school?

93
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.218
The Hebrews put the broken pieces
in the Ark.

94
00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:34.927
When they settled in Canaan,

95
00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:38.514
- they put it in the Temple of Solomon.
- In Jerusalem.

96
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.560
Where it stayed for many years,
until, whoosh, it's gone.

97
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.438
- Where?
- Nobody knows where or when.

98
00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:50.022
An Egyptian Pharaoh, Shishak,
invaded Jerusalem about 980 BC,

99
00:17:51.778 --> 00:17:54.822
and he may have taken
the Ark to the city of Tanis

100
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:58.576
and hidden it in a secret chamber
called the Well of Souls.

101
00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.786
Secret chamber?

102
00:17:59.869 --> 00:18:03.497
About a year
after the Pharaoh returned to Egypt,

103
00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:08.123
the city of Tanis was consumed
by the desert in a year-long sandstorm.

104
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:12.674
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

105
00:18:16.177 --> 00:18:20.677
Obviously we've come to the right men.
You seem to know all about Tanis.

106
00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:24.769
Not really.
Ravenwood is the real expert.

107
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:29.232
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis. Collected some of its relics.

108
00:18:29.899 --> 00:18:33.777
It was his obsession, really.
But he never found the city.

109
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:37.365
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr Ravenwood,

110
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.243
being mentioned so prominently
in a secret Nazi cable.

111
00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:45.869
- Rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi.
- Why do they want him, then?

112
00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:50.833
They want the Staff of Ra headpiece
and they think Abner's got it.

113
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.174
What is the Staff of Ra headpiece?

114
00:18:55.258 --> 00:18:59.758
The Staff is just a stick about this big,
nobody knows for sure how high.

115
00:19:02.223 --> 00:19:04.975
It's capped with an elaborate headpiece

116
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.521
in the shape of the sun,
with a central crystal.

117
00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.357
You'd take the Staff

118
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:15.941
to a map room
with a miniature of the city on the floor.

119
00:19:16.237 --> 00:19:19.156
If you put the Staff in a certain place
at a certain time,

120
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.740
the sun shone through here
and made a beam on the floor,

121
00:19:24.954 --> 00:19:28.040
giving the location of the Well of Souls.

122
00:19:28.124 --> 00:19:32.624
- Where the Ark was kept.
- Which is what the Nazis are seeking.

123
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.089
What does this Ark look like?

124
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:39.886
There's a picture of it right here.

125
00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:45.266
That's it.

126
00:19:52.148 --> 00:19:56.068
- Good God!
- That's what the Hebrews thought.

127
00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:59.739
What's that coming out of there?

128
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:04.323
Lightning. Fire.
The power of God or something.

129
00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.166
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.

130
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.501
Oh, yes.

131
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:16.089
The Bible speaks of the Ark
laying waste to entire regions.

132
00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:21.427
An army which carries the Ark before it

133
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.012
is invincible.

134
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.952
You did it, didn't you?

135
00:20:46.035 --> 00:20:49.705
- They want you to go for it.
- Oh, Marcus!

136
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:52.875
They want you to get the Ark
before the Nazis do

137
00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:55.002
and they'll pay handsomely.

138
00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:57.546
And the museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

139
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.881
Oh, yes.

140
00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:07.139
- The Ark of the Covenant...
- Nothing else has come close.

141
00:21:08.391 --> 00:21:12.019
It represents everything
we got into archaeology for.

142
00:21:15.982 --> 00:21:20.482
Five years ago, I would've
gone after it myself. I'm rather envious.

143
00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:24.407
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.

144
00:21:29.662 --> 00:21:32.831
- Suppose she'll still be with him?
- Possibly.

145
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.920
Marion's the least of your worries,
believe me, Indy.

146
00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:39.797
What do you mean?

147
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.717
For nearly 3,000 years,

148
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.470
Man has been searching
for the lost Ark.

149
00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.599
Not something to be taken lightly.

150
00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:52.810
No one knows its secrets.

151
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.899
It's like nothing
you've ever gone after before.

152
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:02.653
Are you trying to scare me?
You sound like my mother.

153
00:22:02.737 --> 00:22:07.237
We've known each other for a long time.
I don't believe in hocus-pocus.

154
00:22:07.742 --> 00:22:12.242
I'm after a find of historical significance,
you're talking about the boogieman.

155
00:22:12.997 --> 00:22:16.041
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

156
00:22:26.386 --> 00:22:28.513
Nice to see you again, Dr Jones.

157
00:25:28.484 --> 00:25:30.444
Hello, Marion.

158
00:25:36.784 --> 00:25:38.911
Indiana Jones.

159
00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:45.793
Always knew someday
you'd walk back through my door.

160
00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:49.839
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.

161
00:25:49.922 --> 00:25:52.674
What are you doing here in Nepal?

162
00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:55.595
I need a piece your father collected.

163
00:25:55.678 --> 00:25:58.555
I learnt to hate you
in the last 10 years.

164
00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:04.516
- I never meant to hurt you.
- I was a child in love. It was wrong.

165
00:26:05.688 --> 00:26:09.858
- You knew what you were doing.
- Now I do. This is my place. Get out!

166
00:26:13.237 --> 00:26:17.737
You needn't be happy about what I did,
but maybe we can help each other now.

167
00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:21.537
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

168
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:25.041
Bronze piece, about this size.

169
00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:29.461
- Know the one I mean?
- Yeah, I know it.

170
00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:32.589
Where's Abner?

171
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:35.384
Abner's dead.

172
00:26:40.223 --> 00:26:44.723
- Marion, I'm sorry.
- Do you know what you did to my life?

173
00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:50.145
- I can only say sorry so many times.
- Say it again anyway.

174
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:53.736
- Sorry.
- Yeah, everybody's sorry.

175
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.031
Abner was sorry for taking me
to look for his junk,

176
00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.909
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.

177
00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:02.745
Everybody's sorry for something.

178
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:06.123
It's a worthless bronze medallion.
Are you going to give it to me?

179
00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:07.374
Maybe.

180
00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:11.628
- I don't know where it is.
- Maybe you could find it.

181
00:27:12.755 --> 00:27:14.506
3,000 bucks.

182
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:19.887
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

183
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:23.641
I can get you another two in the States.
It's important.

184
00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:26.977
Trust me.

185
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:32.483
You know the piece I mean?
You know where it is?

186
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.280
- Come back tomorrow.
- Why?

187
00:27:38.948 --> 00:27:41.283
Because I said so, that's why.

188
00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:52.837
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

189
00:29:00.404 --> 00:29:03.865
- Good evening, <i>Fräulein.</i>
- The bar's closed.

190
00:29:04.283 --> 00:29:08.783
We are not thirsty.

191
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:13.793
- What do you want?
- The same thing Dr Jones wanted.

192
00:29:13.876 --> 00:29:18.376
Surely he told you
there'd be other interested parties?

193
00:29:18.589 --> 00:29:20.674
It must've slipped his mind.

194
00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:23.594
The man is nefarious.

195
00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:28.808
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

196
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:33.391
- Why? Are you willing to offer more?
- Almost certainly. Do you still have it?

197
00:29:41.737 --> 00:29:45.282
No, but I know where it is.

198
00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:49.744
How about a drink?

199
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:53.874
Your fire is dying here.

200
00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:57.920
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

201
00:29:58.004 --> 00:30:02.504
Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know
who you're used to dealing with,

202
00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:07.429
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

203
00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:13.352
Let me show you what I am used to.

204
00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:19.942
Take your hands off me!

205
00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:24.655
Take your lousy hands off!

206
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:33.163
Wait! I can be reasonable.

207
00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:36.375
- That time is past.
- You don't need that.

208
00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:40.128
Wait.

209
00:30:41.547 --> 00:30:43.549
I'll tell you everything.

210
00:30:43.632 --> 00:30:46.760
Yes, I know you will.

211
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:55.519
Let her go.

212
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:10.928
Whisky.

213
00:32:19.562 --> 00:32:22.523
Shoot them. Shoot them both.

214
00:33:17.536 --> 00:33:19.162
My medallion!

215
00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:31.004
At least you haven't forgotten
how to show a lady a good time.

216
00:33:31.258 --> 00:33:33.843
- You're something!
- Tell you what.

217
00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:35.804
Until I get back my $5,000,

218
00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:38.015
you're getting
more than you bargained for.

219
00:33:38.098 --> 00:33:40.475
I'm your god damn partner!

220
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.516
Cairo, city of the living.

221
00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:22.559
A paradise on Earth.

222
00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:28.732
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?

223
00:34:28.816 --> 00:34:31.401
Where did this animal come from?

224
00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:35.489
Oh, no.

225
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.245
Cute. What an adorable creature.

226
00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.416
Then it shall be welcome in our house.

227
00:34:45.499 --> 00:34:48.543
You don't have to keep it
just because of me.

228
00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:58.720
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

229
00:34:58.804 --> 00:35:01.056
You're the best digger in Egypt.

230
00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.768
My services
are inconsequential to them.

231
00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:07.145
They've hired every digger in Cairo.

232
00:35:07.229 --> 00:35:09.397
The excavation is enormous.

233
00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:13.193
They hire strong backs
and pay pennies.

234
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.739
It's as if the Pharaohs had returned.

235
00:35:16.822 --> 00:35:19.950
- When did they find the map room?
- Three days ago.

236
00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:23.454
They have not one brain among them.
Except one...

237
00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:27.457
He's very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.

238
00:35:29.084 --> 00:35:31.878
- What's his name?
- They call him Bellosh.

239
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.596
Belloq. Belloq.

240
00:35:41.513 --> 00:35:44.599
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

241
00:35:44.683 --> 00:35:47.143
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

242
00:35:47.227 --> 00:35:50.313
They're not going to find it without this.

243
00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:55.151
Who can tell us about these markings?

244
00:35:56.987 --> 00:35:59.489
Perhaps a man I know can help us.

245
00:36:01.825 --> 00:36:06.204
Indy, there's something
that troubles me.

246
00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.540
What is it?

247
00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:11.418
The Ark.

248
00:36:12.127 --> 00:36:16.627
If it is there at Tanis, it is something
Man was not meant to disturb.

249
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.429
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.

250
00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:26.308
- Do we need the monkey?
- I'm surprised at you.

251
00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:28.769
Talking that way about our baby.

252
00:36:29.395 --> 00:36:32.481
- He's got your looks, too.
- And your brains.

253
00:36:34.024 --> 00:36:37.277
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing. Smart.

254
00:36:40.322 --> 00:36:44.409
- Where are you going?
- She'll be all right. Have a date.

255
00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:51.541
Come on, come on... Marion!

256
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:55.253
- What's this?
- It's a date. You eat them.

257
00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:48.974
Why haven't you settled down
and had nine kids like Sallah?

258
00:37:49.057 --> 00:37:50.933
Who says I haven't?

259
00:37:52.227 --> 00:37:55.188
I do. Dad had you figured long ago.

260
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:07.450
- He said you were a bum.
- That's generous.

261
00:38:07.534 --> 00:38:11.538
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
He loved you.

262
00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:14.791
- Took a lot for you to alienate him.
- Just you.

263
00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:35.645
Marion, get out of here! Duck!

264
00:39:17.813 --> 00:39:19.272
Right!

265
00:40:09.656 --> 00:40:10.823
Marion!

266
00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:33.472
Help! Over here, Indy!

267
00:40:33.555 --> 00:40:35.848
Get out of the way! Move it!

268
00:40:37.351 --> 00:40:39.019
Help me!

269
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:47.110
You can't do this to me.
I'm an American.

270
00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:56.369
Indiana Jones! Help me, Jones!

271
00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.275
Marion...

272
00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:16.843
You looking for me?

273
00:43:25.268 --> 00:43:28.020
- Belloq.
- Good afternoon, Dr Jones.

274
00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:32.192
- I ought to kill you now.
- Not a very private place for a murder.

275
00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.196
They don't care if we kill each other.

276
00:43:36.279 --> 00:43:39.657
They're not gonna interfere
in our business.

277
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:42.326
It was not I
who brought the girl into this.

278
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.453
Sit down before you fall down.

279
00:43:44.538 --> 00:43:47.541
We can at least
behave like civilised people.

280
00:43:58.343 --> 00:44:01.554
I see your taste in friends
hasn't changed.

281
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.180
Odd that it should end this way,
after so many stimulating encounters.

282
00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:08.394
I almost regret it.

283
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.898
Where shall I find a new adversary
so close to my own level?

284
00:44:12.023 --> 00:44:13.899
Try the local sewer.

285
00:44:16.403 --> 00:44:20.903
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.

286
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:26.538
Yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

287
00:44:26.621 --> 00:44:30.082
Our methods do not differ
as much as you pretend.

288
00:44:30.208 --> 00:44:33.377
I'm a shadowy reflection of you.

289
00:44:33.461 --> 00:44:36.380
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me.

290
00:44:36.464 --> 00:44:40.426
- To push you out of the light.
- Now you're getting nasty.

291
00:44:42.262 --> 00:44:46.099
You know it's true. How nice.

292
00:44:46.224 --> 00:44:50.394
Look at this. It's worthless.

293
00:44:50.478 --> 00:44:52.771
$10 from a street vendor.

294
00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:57.398
Bury it in the sand for a thousand years
and it becomes priceless.

295
00:44:57.903 --> 00:45:02.403
Like the Ark. Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.

296
00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:07.829
What about your boss, Der Führer?

297
00:45:07.954 --> 00:45:11.332
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

298
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:15.958
All in good time,
when I'm finished with it.

299
00:45:16.254 --> 00:45:19.632
Jones, do you realise what the Ark is?

300
00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:24.258
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.

301
00:45:24.763 --> 00:45:26.848
And it's within my reach.

302
00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:30.351
You want to talk to God?

303
00:45:31.978 --> 00:45:35.481
Let's go see him together.
I've nothing better to do.

304
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:39.151
Uncle Indy! Come back home now!

305
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:47.827
Next time, Indiana Jones,
it'll take more than children to save you.

306
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:08.556
I thought I would find you there.
Better than the US Marines, eh?

307
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:23.321
- Marion's dead.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

308
00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:28.368
Life goes on, Indy. There is the truth!

309
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.209
I have much to tell you.
First, we'll take them home.

310
00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:38.878
Then I will take you to the old man.

311
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:31.263
How did Belloq do it?

312
00:47:31.389 --> 00:47:33.474
Where'd he get
a copy of the headpiece?

313
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.020
There are no pictures,
no duplicates anywhere.

314
00:47:37.103 --> 00:47:39.522
I tell you only what I saw myself.

315
00:47:39.606 --> 00:47:43.693
A headpiece like that one,
except the edges were rougher.

316
00:47:43.777 --> 00:47:45.904
In the centre,
the Frenchman had a crystal,

317
00:47:45.987 --> 00:47:50.487
and surrounding the crystal on one side
were raised markings, like that one.

318
00:47:55.163 --> 00:47:57.331
They made the calculations
in the map room?

319
00:47:57.457 --> 00:48:01.169
This morning.
Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.

320
00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:06.257
When they came out,
they gave us a new spot to dig in,

321
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:08.301
away from the camp.

322
00:48:09.594 --> 00:48:13.514
- The Well of Souls, huh?
- Come, come, look here.

323
00:48:15.016 --> 00:48:18.936
- Sit down, come, sit down.
- What is it?

324
00:48:20.647 --> 00:48:25.147
This is a warning
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.

325
00:48:25.276 --> 00:48:28.237
Did Belloq get the height
of the Staff from here?

326
00:48:28.321 --> 00:48:32.821
Yes, it is here. This was the old way.
This means six <i>kadam</i> high.

327
00:48:34.452 --> 00:48:36.328
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

328
00:48:39.582 --> 00:48:44.082
And take back one <i>kadam</i> to honour
the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.

329
00:48:58.685 --> 00:49:03.022
You said their headpiece only had
markings on one side. You sure?

330
00:49:04.357 --> 00:49:08.694
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!

331
00:49:11.322 --> 00:49:15.822
<i>I am the monarch of the sea
I am the ruler of the...</i>

332
00:49:26.713 --> 00:49:28.297
Bad dates.

333
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:48.067
I told you not to be premature
in your communiquė to Berlin.

334
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:52.651
Archaeology is not an exact science.
It does not deal in time schedules.

335
00:49:54.199 --> 00:49:58.699
The Führer is not patient. He demands
constant reports and expects progress.

336
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:02.206
- You led me to believe...
- Nothing!

337
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.667
I only said it looked very favourable.

338
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:09.251
Besides, with the information we have,
my calculations were correct.

339
00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:11.799
They're not kidding, are they?

340
00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:17.472
- When does the sun hit the map room?
- About 9:00 in the morning.

341
00:50:17.555 --> 00:50:19.431
Not much time, then.

342
00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:22.769
- Where are they digging for the Well?
- On that ridge.

343
00:50:22.852 --> 00:50:25.646
- But the map room is over there.
- Let's go!

344
00:54:32.685 --> 00:54:34.645
Sallah?

345
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:37.314
Sallah!

346
00:54:57.502 --> 00:55:01.506
What is the matter?
I'll fetch you water, I shall get it for you.

347
00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:06.218
I will get you water. How is the food?

348
00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:24.111
I thought you were dead.
They must've switched baskets.

349
00:55:28.407 --> 00:55:31.827
- Are you hurt?
- No. Get me out of here.

350
00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:36.373
They'll be back any minute.
Cut me loose, quick.

351
00:55:36.457 --> 00:55:39.334
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

352
00:55:43.756 --> 00:55:46.091
What's wrong? Cut me loose.

353
00:55:46.175 --> 00:55:49.052
- I know where the Ark is.
- The Ark's here?

354
00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:52.389
I'm coming with you.
Get me out of here!

355
00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:55.726
If I take you now,
they'll start looking for us.

356
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:59.605
Get me out of here! Are you crazy?

357
00:56:00.606 --> 00:56:04.735
I hate to do this,
but if you don't keep quiet,

358
00:56:04.819 --> 00:56:07.613
this whole thing's going to be shot.

359
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.699
I'll be back to get you.

360
00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:58.414
That's it.

361
00:56:59.624 --> 00:57:04.124
Perhaps the Ark is waiting in some
antechamber for us to discover.

362
00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:08.466
Perhaps there's some
vital evidence eluding us.

363
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:12.719
- Perhaps the girl can help us.
- My feeling exactly.

364
00:57:12.803 --> 00:57:15.096
She kept the original for years.

365
00:57:15.181 --> 00:57:18.392
She may know much
if properly motivated.

366
00:57:18.476 --> 00:57:21.353
I tell you the girl knows nothing.

367
00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:25.190
I'm surprised you're squeamish.
That's not your reputation.

368
00:57:25.274 --> 00:57:28.860
It needn't concern you.
I have just the man for the job.

369
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:35.826
Hail Hitler.

370
00:58:58.492 --> 00:59:01.077
Indy, here, we've hit stone.

371
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.502
Clear it off. Come on, find the edges.

372
00:59:25.269 --> 00:59:28.146
Good, good, good. You see, Indy?

373
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:32.067
- Okay, bring the pry-bars in.
- As a team, boys, as a team!

374
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:35.320
Push!

375
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:44.455
Get 'em in there. Get 'em under.
That's it. Watch your toes!

376
00:59:52.546 --> 00:59:54.631
Carefully, carefully.

377
01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.853
Sorry, Indy.

378
01:00:09.688 --> 01:00:13.108
Indy, why does the floor move?

379
01:00:15.027 --> 01:00:17.029
Give me your torch.

380
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:51.187
Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?

381
01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:58.445
Asps. Very dangerous.

382
01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.158
You go first.

383
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.760
To escape on foot, the desert
is three weeks in every direction.

384
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.850
So please eat something.

385
01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:37.359
I must apologise for your treatment.

386
01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:41.943
No food, no water. What kind
of people are these friends of yours?

387
01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:46.781
At this point in my work,
they are necessary evils.

388
01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:51.369
They're not my friends.
However, with the right connections,

389
01:01:51.498 --> 01:01:55.585
even in this part of the world,
we are not entirely uncivilised.

390
01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:01.550
- Beautiful.
- I would very much like to see you in it.

391
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.013
I'll bet you would.

392
01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.685
All right.

393
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.821
What have you got to drink
around here?

394
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.660
We don't have much time.
Soon they'll harm you.

395
01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:33.244
I won't be able to stop them, unless you
give me something to placate them.

396
01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:40.293
Some piece of information which
I can use to protect you from them.

397
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:46.549
I've already told you everything.
I have no loyalty to Jones.

398
01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:49.264
He's brought me nothing but trouble.

399
01:02:55.729 --> 01:02:57.772
Marion, you are beautiful.

400
01:03:02.736 --> 01:03:05.321
I don't think we need a chaperone.

401
01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:11.119
Steadily... Steadily!

402
01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:19.123
Down, down. Carefully, carefully.

403
01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:21.296
You all right, Indy?

404
01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:26.551
Gently, boys, gently, gently.

405
01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:49.324
I told you it would be all right.

406
01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:16.685
Sallah, get down here.

407
01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.497
You pour.

408
01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:33.447
That's good.

409
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.701
Whoops!

410
01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:46.960
What is this stuff, Renė?

411
01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:51.544
I grew up with this. It's my family label.

412
01:07:20.744 --> 01:07:24.789
Well, I have to be going now, Renė.

413
01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:29.252
I like you, Renė, very much.

414
01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:32.839
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

415
01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:39.262
We meet again, <i>Fräulein.</i>

416
01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:43.474
You Americans, you are all the same.

417
01:07:45.018 --> 01:07:48.062
Always over-dressing
for the wrong occasions.

418
01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.846
Now

419
01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:25.725
what shall we talk about?

420
01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.764
All right, take it up.

421
01:09:46.848 --> 01:09:48.391
Easy!

422
01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:54.768
- You're as stubborn as that girl.
- You like her too much.

423
01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.360
Your methods of archaeology
are too primitive for me.

424
01:09:58.443 --> 01:10:02.943
You would use a bulldozer
to find a china cup.

425
01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:09.830
Wake your men!

426
01:10:09.913 --> 01:10:13.791
- Indy, the torches are burning out.
- Go on, get out of here.

427
01:10:34.438 --> 01:10:38.150
- Sallah.
- Hello, hello!

428
01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:43.321
Dr Jones, whatever are you doing
in such a nasty place?

429
01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.323
Come down, I'll show you.

430
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:49.411
Thanks, but we're very comfortable
up here.

431
01:10:49.494 --> 01:10:51.078
That's right, isn't it?

432
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:54.082
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.

433
01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:59.462
So, once again,
what was briefly yours is now mine.

434
01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.925
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.

435
01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:07.929
You'll be a permanent addition
to this archaeological find.

436
01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:11.766
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

437
01:11:13.101 --> 01:11:16.771
- Son of a bitch.
- We must be going now.

438
01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:21.355
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you all alone.

439
01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:26.489
Slimy pig, let me go. Stop it!

440
01:11:31.495 --> 01:11:32.954
Hang on!

441
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.793
Don't fall. I've got an idea.

442
01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.049
You traitor, get your hands off of me!

443
01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.059
Snakes...

444
01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.146
At your feet!

445
01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:02.400
- The girl was mine!
- She's no use to the Führer's mission.

446
01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:09.574
I wonder sometimes
if you have that clearly in mind.

447
01:12:09.699 --> 01:12:14.199
- It was not to be, <i>chérie.</i>
- You bastards, I'll get you for this!

448
01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:17.749
Indiana Jones, <i>adieu.</i>

449
01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:45.193
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.

450
01:12:46.444 --> 01:12:48.863
This whole place is slithering!

451
01:12:51.783 --> 01:12:54.619
- Indy!
- Jesus!

452
01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:02.710
- Where did you get this? From him?
- I was trying to escape.

453
01:13:02.794 --> 01:13:05.046
- How hard did you try?
- Where the hell were you?

454
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.214
Watch it. Watch it.

455
01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.925
- What are you doing?
- Help me, fire!

456
01:13:11.803 --> 01:13:14.388
- How do we get out?
- I'm working on it.

457
01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:16.307
Do it faster.

458
01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.275
- Where are you going?
- Through that wall.

459
01:13:26.234 --> 01:13:30.238
- Get ready to run, whatever happens.
- What do you mean by that?

460
01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:46.462
Indy! Don't leave me here by myself.

461
01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:12.279
Indy!

462
01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:17.448
- Here we go, get ready!
- Indy, the torch is going out!

463
01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.812
Look, look.

464
01:16:04.684 --> 01:16:09.184
They're flying it out. When it's loaded,
we'll already be on the plane.

465
01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:19.278
<i>Monsieur,</i> let us toast our success
in the desert. To the Ark.

466
01:16:19.699 --> 01:16:23.077
When we are far from here,
and not with you.

467
01:18:27.076 --> 01:18:28.118
Indy!

468
01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:21.422
Stay with the Ark!

469
01:19:27.053 --> 01:19:28.554
Look out!

470
01:19:39.023 --> 01:19:41.191
- Oh, my God!
- Marion...

471
01:19:41.317 --> 01:19:44.194
I'm locked in here. I'm here!

472
01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:49.075
- Indy, I'm stuck.
- Pull on the latch.

473
01:19:53.037 --> 01:19:55.080
I'm stuck.

474
01:19:55.206 --> 01:19:58.417
Indy, I can't force the lock.

475
01:20:28.573 --> 01:20:30.866
- It's stuck.
- Turn it.

476
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:33.827
- It's stuck.
- Never mind. Get back!

477
01:20:55.266 --> 01:20:57.685
Get the Ark away from here.

478
01:20:57.769 --> 01:21:01.189
Put it on the truck.
We will fly it out of Cairo.

479
01:21:01.272 --> 01:21:04.441
And, Gobler, I want plenty of protection.

480
01:21:10.698 --> 01:21:12.199
Jones.

481
01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:21.792
Holy smoke! My friends,
I'm so pleased you're not dead.

482
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:27.711
We have no time if you want the Ark.
It's been loaded onto a truck for Cairo.

483
01:21:28.549 --> 01:21:31.510
Truck? What truck?

484
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.081
Let's go!

485
01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:13.219
Get back to Cairo.
Get us some transport to England.

486
01:22:13.302 --> 01:22:17.802
Boat, plane, anything.
Meet me at Omar's.

487
01:22:18.182 --> 01:22:20.350
- I'm going after that truck.
- How?

488
01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:23.271
I don't know. I'm making this up as I go.

489
01:30:04.315 --> 01:30:07.735
Everything is arranged.
The Ark is on board.

490
01:30:07.818 --> 01:30:10.904
Nothing's lacking now you're here.

491
01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:13.281
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

492
01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:17.036
Mr Katanga.

493
01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:24.831
Mr Katanga, these are my friends.
They are my family.

494
01:30:25.294 --> 01:30:28.505
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

495
01:30:28.631 --> 01:30:30.841
My cabin is theirs.

496
01:30:30.966 --> 01:30:34.636
Mr Jones, I've heard
a lot about you, sir.

497
01:30:35.471 --> 01:30:38.515
Your appearance
is exactly the way I imagined.

498
01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:44.521
Goodbye.

499
01:30:47.316 --> 01:30:51.153
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.

500
01:30:53.739 --> 01:30:56.032
You're my good friend.

501
01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.369
Sallah...

502
01:31:03.165 --> 01:31:05.208
That is for Fayah.

503
01:31:06.418 --> 01:31:09.546
That is for your children.
And this is for you.

504
01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:16.678
Thank you.

505
01:31:25.562 --> 01:31:30.062
<i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>

506
01:31:31.026 --> 01:31:35.196
<i>As free as a mountain bird</i>

507
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.780
<i>His energetic fist
should be ready to resist</i>

508
01:31:49.795 --> 01:31:51.463
Where did you go?

509
01:31:51.588 --> 01:31:53.464
I've been cleaning up.

510
01:31:54.591 --> 01:31:56.843
Where did you get that?

511
01:31:56.927 --> 01:31:59.304
- From him.
- Who "him"?

512
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:03.434
Katanga. I'm not the first woman
to travel with these pirates.

513
01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:07.729
- It's lovely.
- Yeah?

514
01:32:07.813 --> 01:32:09.314
- Yeah.
- Really?

515
01:32:22.619 --> 01:32:24.287
What did you say?

516
01:32:30.794 --> 01:32:33.463
Wait, I don't need any help.

517
01:32:33.589 --> 01:32:34.798
You do.

518
01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:39.761
You're not the man I knew 10 years ago.

519
01:32:39.845 --> 01:32:43.348
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

520
01:32:51.482 --> 01:32:55.611
I don't need a nurse.
I just want to sleep.

521
01:32:55.694 --> 01:32:59.114
- How's this here?
- Go away! Yes, it hurts.

522
01:33:00.824 --> 01:33:04.577
God damn it, Indy.
Where doesn't it hurt?

523
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:05.995
Here.

524
01:33:12.002 --> 01:33:13.336
Here.

525
01:33:22.346 --> 01:33:24.306
This isn't too bad.

526
01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:34.857
Here.

527
01:33:55.712 --> 01:33:56.879
Jones.

528
01:33:59.424 --> 01:34:00.591
Jones.

529
01:34:03.554 --> 01:34:06.265
We never seem to get a break, do we?

530
01:34:34.418 --> 01:34:36.878
- What is it?
- Engines have stopped.

531
01:34:36.962 --> 01:34:38.755
I'm gonna do a check.

532
01:34:49.391 --> 01:34:51.244
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

533
01:34:51.268 --> 01:34:52.644
Holy shit.

534
01:34:54.563 --> 01:34:59.063
You and the girl
must disappear in the hold. Go, go!

535
01:35:21.632 --> 01:35:23.300
Don't you touch me.

536
01:36:08.178 --> 01:36:11.681
- What about Jones?
- No trace yet.

537
01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:13.433
Jones is dead.

538
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:20.190
I killed him. He was of no use to us.

539
01:36:20.315 --> 01:36:24.815
This girl has certain value where
we're headed. She'll bring a good price.

540
01:36:29.032 --> 01:36:33.119
Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken.

541
01:36:33.203 --> 01:36:37.123
Take it, but leave us the girl.
It will reduce our loss.

542
01:36:37.207 --> 01:36:41.707
Savage, you are not in the position
to ask for anything.

543
01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:47.213
We will take what we wish, then decide
whether to blow up your ship.

544
01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:55.141
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.

545
01:36:55.225 --> 01:36:58.228
I'm sure your Führer would approve.

546
01:36:58.353 --> 01:37:02.065
If she fails to please me,
you may do with her as you wish.

547
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:04.734
I'll waste no more time with her.

548
01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.236
Excuse me.

549
01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:25.505
I can't find Mr Jones.
I've looked everywhere.

550
01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:28.174
He's got to be here somewhere.

551
01:37:28.258 --> 01:37:29.592
Look again.

552
01:37:31.386 --> 01:37:33.179
- I've found him.
- Where?

553
01:37:33.263 --> 01:37:34.430
There.

554
01:40:00.744 --> 01:40:03.997
The altar has been prepared
as you instructed.

555
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.749
Good. Take the Ark there immediately.

556
01:40:09.252 --> 01:40:10.753
<i>Monsieur...</i>

557
01:40:12.756 --> 01:40:17.256
I am uncomfortable
with the thought of this Jewish ritual.

558
01:40:19.095 --> 01:40:21.680
Are you sure it's necessary?

559
01:40:21.765 --> 01:40:23.767
Let me ask you this,

560
01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:28.350
would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin for your Führer

561
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:33.859
and finding out only then
if the sacred Covenant is inside,

562
01:40:33.944 --> 01:40:37.113
and whether you've
accomplished your mission

563
01:40:37.239 --> 01:40:40.242
and obtained the one true Ark?

564
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:09.997
Hello!

565
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:13.876
Jones?

566
01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:16.379
Jones!

567
01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:19.174
I'm going to blow up the Ark, Renė.

568
01:42:25.055 --> 01:42:27.724
Your persistence surprises even me.

569
01:42:29.059 --> 01:42:32.729
- You'll give mercenaries a bad name.
- Dr Jones.

570
01:42:36.358 --> 01:42:38.902
Surely you don't think you can escape?

571
01:42:38.985 --> 01:42:41.237
That depends how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

572
01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.239
All I want is the girl.

573
01:42:48.411 --> 01:42:52.911
- If we refuse?
- Then your Führer has no prize.

574
01:42:54.209 --> 01:42:58.504
Okay, stand back.
All of you, stand back, right back.

575
01:42:58.588 --> 01:43:01.090
Okay, Jones, you win.

576
01:43:02.759 --> 01:43:04.260
Blow it up.

577
01:43:10.266 --> 01:43:14.766
Yes, blow it up. Blow it back to God.

578
01:43:16.398 --> 01:43:20.360
All your life has been spent
pursuing archaeological relics.

579
01:43:20.443 --> 01:43:24.943
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

580
01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:27.700
You want to see it open as well as I.

581
01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:33.790
Indiana, we are simply
passing through history.

582
01:43:35.959 --> 01:43:40.459
This... This is history.

583
01:43:51.307 --> 01:43:52.975
Do as you will.

584
01:46:28.298 --> 01:46:32.798
Marion, don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

585
01:47:02.165 --> 01:47:04.000
It's beautiful!

586
01:47:14.677 --> 01:47:18.055
- Indy?
- Don't look. Keep your eyes shut!

587
01:49:10.418 --> 01:49:13.546
You've done your country
a great service.

588
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:17.591
We trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

589
01:49:17.675 --> 01:49:20.344
The money's fine.
The situation is unacceptable.

590
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:24.970
- I guess that wraps it up.
- Where is the Ark?

591
01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:31.434
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere safe.

592
01:49:31.647 --> 01:49:35.108
- From whom?
- It's a source of unspeakable power.

593
01:49:35.193 --> 01:49:38.613
- It has to be researched.
- And it will be.

594
01:49:38.696 --> 01:49:42.449
I assure you, Dr Brody. Dr Jones.

595
01:49:42.533 --> 01:49:45.494
We have top men
working on it right now.

596
01:49:47.163 --> 01:49:51.663
- Who?
- Top men.

597
01:49:55.379 --> 01:49:58.840
Hey, what happened?
You don't look very happy.

598
01:49:58.966 --> 01:50:01.635
- Fools!
- What did they say?

599
01:50:02.678 --> 01:50:06.848
- They don't know what they've got.
- I know what I've got here.

600
01:50:08.643 --> 01:50:11.020
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

601
01:50:13.356 --> 01:50:15.900
You know, a drink?
