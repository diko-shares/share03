00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.539

Mmm num ba de

Doo buh dum ba beh beh

17
00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:53.382
Pressure pushing down on me

18
00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:57.594
Pressing down on you, no man ask for

19
00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:01.974
Under pressure
That burns a building down

20
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.810
Splits a family in two

21
00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:05.894
Puts people on streets

22
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:09.106

23
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.983

25
00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:13.735
Ee day da

26
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.862
That's okay

27
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:19.491
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about

28
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:22.452
Watching some good friends screaming

29
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:28.000
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher

30
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.920
Pressure on people, people on streets

31
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.887
(Captain) Careful with this,
it's highly toxic.

32
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.847
Come on, lads, keep it moving.

33
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.473
Keep it moving.

34
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:46.977
(man 1) Go, go, go!

35
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.564
(man 2) Is this double pay or what?

36
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.648
(man 1) It's toxic waste.

37
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.115
(Captain) What are you doing
sitting there, mate?

38
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.200
Get amongst it.

39
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.577
I want this filth off my ship
as fast as possible.

40
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:11.960
(parrot squawks)

41
00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:18.509
(camera shutter clicks)

42
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.932
(parrot) What you doing, then?

43
00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.059
(squawks)

44
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:28.560
Naughty.

45
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.896
Help! Help!

46
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.524
Naughty.

47
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.733
Shh.

48
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.735
Keep your little beak shut.

49
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:39.530
-Not very nice.
-Otherwise, you'll go for a swim.

50
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.073
Help! Help!

51
00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:43.200
Help me! Help me!

52
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:44.993
-Hey.
-(parrot squawks)

53
00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:46.078
Uh, well done.

54
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.080
I'm here from the home office.

55
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.164
(parrot) Bullshit.

56
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.792
Here checking on security protocols...

57
00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.335
(camera whirring)

58
00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.962
...and, um, taking a few pictures,
so smile.

59
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.630
-(camera shutter clicks)
-(both grunting)

60
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.298
What are you doing in here?
(groans)

61
00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.716
-(parrot) Not very nice.
-What's going on?

62
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.677
(both grunting)

63
00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:05.305
That's him!

64
00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.265
I'll get you!

65
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.267
-(man 1 shouts indistinctly)
-(man 2 grunts)

66
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.269
(grunts)

67
00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:13.856
(screams)

68
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.733
(man) Hey, hey! Get at this!

69
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.486
(speaks indistinctly)

70
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.575
(chain rattles)

71
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.660
(grunting)

72
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.127
Get him!

73
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.882
You two, go left! Cut him off!

74
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:41.800
I want him caught, dead or dead.

75
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.596
(grunting)

76
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.890
(man) Not there! Go around! Go around!

77
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:52.311
There you go, mate. End of the line.

78
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.771
Okay.

79
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.523
You're all under arrest.

80
00:05:57.274 --> 00:06:00.235
For the illegal dumping
of radioactive materials.

81
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.238
Yeah, you, you, you, you and you.

82
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.575
What, me and... And him and him?

83
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:07.618
And him?

84
00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:11.163
-Kill him.
-Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:13.832
I know. You want to see the warrant.

86
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.375
It's right in my pocket.

87
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.046
I'll see you in court, yeah?

88
00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:28.263
We're out of shipping lanes,
and you're 200 miles from shore.

89
00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:29.473
So enjoy your swim.

90
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.022
I've got him. Just off the port side.

91
00:06:39.942 --> 00:06:41.443
He's like a green James Bond. I like it.

92
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:46.865
Oh, no, my hat!

93
00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.034
Hello, suckers.

94
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.577
Looks like he's been making friends.

95
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.330
Wherever he goes, people just love him.

96
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.498
God knows why.

97
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.793
(engines roaring)

98
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.671
Have you got this?

99
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.173
We'll see.

100
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.052
Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

101
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.346
Maybe this isn't the best idea.

102
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.557
This is gonna be awesome.

103
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.724
(Mac) Define "awesome."

104
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.017
(Rigas) I'm about to.

105
00:07:15.978 --> 00:07:16.770
Opening hatch.

106
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.484
(plane rumbling, beeping)

107
00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:34.496
(Jonas) Next time, put a little
more air in this thing.

108
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.123
It's like breathing through a straw.

109
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.124
(Mac) Worked, didn't it?

110
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:38.709
(Rigas) You okay?

111
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:42.462
If you love your job,
you'll never work a day in your life.

112
00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:49.928
(Curtis) Okay, bring in Test 15.

113
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.389
Initiating suit power-up.

114
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.307
(man) Clear.

115
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.850
(machine whirs)

116
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.268
("Dare" playing)

117
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.352
Promising.

118
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.191
(beeping)

119
00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:04.693
(Curtis) The exo suit is performing
way beyond what we expected, Jiuming.

120
00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:07.446
(grunts)

121
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.949
(Curtis) 21% increase in power.

122
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.952
Not bad, huh?

123
00:08:14.036 --> 00:08:15.037
So cool.

124
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.084
I can't wait to use these in the trench.

125
00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:25.047
Hi.

126
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.964
(in Mandarin)

127
00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:27.257
What's up favorite niece?

128
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:28.967
I'm supposed to tell you not to be
late for the party tonight.

129
00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:32.179
Of course.

130
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.600
-Maybe 25. Mm?
-Okay.

131
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.894
(Meiying) I mean it, don't be late!

132
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.153
(indistinct chatter)

133
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.197
(Mac) I cannot believe
you got this far in life

134
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.406
without knowing how to tie a tie.

135
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.993
First, let's not overstate
how far I've gotten in life.

136
00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.663
Second, never involved
wearing a monkey suit.

137
00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:00.082
-Perfect. You look great.
-Thanks.

138
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.709
Ah. Maybe this is the start of something.

139
00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:04.169
(sighs) Don't count on it.

140
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.588
(both chuckle)

141
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.633
Hi.

142
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:16.139
(Jonas) That guy look familiar to you?

143
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.099
No.

144
00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:21.228
-(Jonas) I don't like him.
-You don't like anyone.

145
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:22.855
I like you.

146
00:09:22.938 --> 00:09:24.731
That's 'cause I save
your life all the time...

147
00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:27.150
I buy you beers
and I back you up in bar fights.

148
00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:29.194
It's 'cause you're a special guy.

149
00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.113
You're both special. (inhales)

150
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.073
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

151
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.784
-Thanks for the money.
-(woman) Ladies and gentlemen,

152
00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:39.496
welcome to the 10th anniversary
of the Oceanic Institute.

153
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.497
I'm Hilary Driscoll.

154
00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:44.418
Thank you for coming tonight,
and for joining me

155
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.754
in funding this incredible work.

156
00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:48.714
(applause)

157
00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.465
Stop. Don't fidget.

158
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.719
Why exactly do I have to be
up here anyway?

159
00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:55.971
-(sighs)
-'Cause you're a team player.

160
00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.182
Great.

161
00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:02.311
Please give a warm welcome

162
00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.979
to the director of the Institute.

163
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.105
(crowd cheering)

164
00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:06.857
Zhang Jiuming.

165
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:11.445
Thank you, Hilary.

166
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:15.908
(in Mandarin)

167
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.035
As the great poet Song Lian said...

168
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.206
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

169
00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:27.252
My father named me Jiuming,

170
00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.422
which means ocean

171
00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:31.590
or abyss.

172
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.430
My father and my sister
spent their lives studying the ocean.

173
00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:42.809
It wasn't until they were both gone
that I began to wonder

174
00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.187
what my purpose was.

175
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.940
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying,

176
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.358
I saw that there was a future.

177
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.613
I merged my father's research institute
with my company

178
00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:01.161
to carry forward our tradition
of exploring the unknown in their honor.

179
00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:03.789
(guests cheering)

180
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.709
To mark this tenth anniversary,

181
00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.295
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

182
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:11.964
(device beeps)

183
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.591
(waves splashing)

184
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.137
(in Mandarin)

185
00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:20.264
Her name is Haiqi.

186
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.183
She is the world's only megalodon
in captivity.

187
00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:25.811
We found her injured as a pup.

188
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:29.231
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned
a tremendous amount about the megalodons

189
00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:30.774
as well as the trench where they live.

190
00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:35.988
(in English) Thanks to the generous
donations from our supporters,

191
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:38.448
we have been able
to create the technology

192
00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:40.534
to pass through the thermocline,

193
00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.036
a thermal layer of freezing cold water

194
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.081
that separates Haiqi's world from ours

195
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:50.335
and into a trench 6,000 meters
below sea level.

196
00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.006
Thanks to you, we have the ability
to go further than ever before.

197
00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:54.923
(in Mandarin)

198
00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:58.051
Protecting the ocean is crucial,
for China and all mankind.

199
00:11:58.719 --> 00:11:59.595
Thank you.

200
00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.054
(crowd cheering)

201
00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:04.308
(Driscoll) And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.

202
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.268
So, thank you all

203
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:10.898
for being part of protecting
this incredible ecosystem.

204
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:13.650
Thank you for coming.

205
00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:14.735
(in Mandarin)

206
00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:17.196
Do you think there are more creatures
to be discovered down there?

207
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.156
There has to be.

208
00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:21.909
(Mac) Who wants to get a selfie
with the man

209
00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:24.995
who fought a megalodon
and lived to tell the tale?

210
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.123
We give you, ladies and gentlemen,
Jonas Taylor.

211
00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:30.250
-(guests cheering)
-There he is! There he is.

212
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.339
I know this was your idea.

213
00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:37.174
-(camera shutter clicking)
-I'm gonna kill you.

214
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.384
Smile and pretend you love it.

215
00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:41.470
(Mac) Go on, give him a hug.
Give him a tickle.

216
00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.847
Oh, he loves people.

217
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.189
(ominous music playing)

218
00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:57.945
(Meiying) I wanna go
to Mana One with you.

219
00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.155
I want to dive the trench.

220
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:02.366
No.

221
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:04.493
Sorry, Meiying.

222
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:06.161
Why not?

223
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.747
Mom was diving all the time at my age.

224
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.625
Not to 25,000 feet.

225
00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:14.920
Saying it's too dangerous?

226
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:15.963
Too dangerous for you.

227
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.632
But not dangerous.

228
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.553
In psychology, they call
that "cognitive dissonance."

229
00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:25.389
In the real world,
they call it "parenting."

230
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.518
You need to start taking me seriously
as a scientist.

231
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.311
-You're 14.
-Exactly.

232
00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:36.066
I know every system on Mana One,
every dive protocol,

233
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.860
and every animal we've seen down there.

234
00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:42.406
(sighs) Hey, look.
You can come to Mana One.

235
00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:45.033
To observe the dive.

236
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.453
And that's it. (exhales)

237
00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.373
Jiuming is swimming with the meg.

238
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:53.792
Uncle.

239
00:13:53.876 --> 00:13:55.169
(announcer speaking indistinctly)

240
00:13:55.294 --> 00:13:56.962
(Curtis) Haiqi's vitals are elevated.

241
00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:59.381
Be careful,
she's definitely aware of you.

242
00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:05.721
(on Radio) Why are you swimming
with the meg, Jiuming?

243
00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.723
I'm conducting an experiment.

244
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.225
Is the experiment "Do I taste good?"

245
00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:12.686
(in Mandarin)

246
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.812
Uncle, are you crazy?

247
00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:14.938
(in English) It's okay.

248
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.733
I've been training Haiqi
since she was a pup.

249
00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.527
A meg is not trainable, Jiuming.

250
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:24.531
But if you wanna be eaten
in front of your niece, go ahead.

251
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.242
Fifty bucks says
this is gonna end badly.

252
00:14:27.326 --> 00:14:28.744
I'll take that action.

253
00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.537
(Sal) I am all in for team shark.

254
00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.290
DJ: What?
You can't bet on a shark, man.

255
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.333
That's bad karma.

256
00:14:34.416 --> 00:14:36.460
Come on, guys, focus. That's not cool.

257
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:37.669
Jiuming...

258
00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:41.340
I'd like to respectfully suggest
that this is truly a terrible idea.

259
00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.592
Megs and humanity
were never meant to mix.

260
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:44.593
(radio beeps)

261
00:14:45.135 --> 00:14:47.012
Haiqi and I have a special bond.

262
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.014
Watch this.

263
00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:53.936
One click to come. Two clicks to go.

264
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.522
-(device clicks)
-(breathing heavily)

265
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.802
(Lance) Whoa, I think
she's looking at us.

266
00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:35.978
You see?

267
00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:39.773
(Curtis) She's coming around.
Heart rate is up.

268
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:41.775
-Moving in fast.
-(beeping)

269
00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.407
(Lance over radio) Four hundred meters.

270
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.164
(in Mandarin)

271
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.666
Slowly, slowly.

272
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.459
(computer beeping rapidly)

273
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.421
-(Curtis) Jiuming, she's not responding.
-Come on, Haiqi.

274
00:16:02.588 --> 00:16:03.797
(Lance) Two hundred meters.

275
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.427
One hundred meters.

276
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:09.678
(Curtis) Jiuming, move.

277
00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.680
It's too late. She's coming in too fast.

278
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.265
(Lance) Fifty meters.

279
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.184
(Mac) Pull the cord.

280
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:16.935
(Lance) Twenty meters.

281
00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.562
-(Mac) Jiuming, get out of there!
-(Meiying) Uncle, no!

282
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.688
(thuds)

283
00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:26.737
Did it get him?

284
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.655
I don't know. I couldn't watch.

285
00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:30.115
I don't see him.

286
00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.952
I knew this was a bad idea.

287
00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.917
-(door opens)
-(in Mandarin)

288
00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:40.918
Total success.

289
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.295
(DJ laughing)

290
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:44.880
Uncle! Are you crazy?

291
00:16:45.464 --> 00:16:46.590
It's all right, I'm good.

292
00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.133
Huh? (chuckles)

293
00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:50.093
(in English) That was exciting, huh?

294
00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:54.431
I can't figure out what's wrong with her.

295
00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:56.517
She's been acting strangely all week.

296
00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:58.685
(Jonas) You can clickety-click
all you want.

297
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:01.313
The problem is, that it's a meg.

298
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.523
And you're a snack.

299
00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:04.107
-(woman) Yeah.
-(indistinct chatter)

300
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.735
For the record,
you scared the hell out of Meiying.

301
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.030
You're one to talk.
What were you doing on that ship?

302
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:13.659
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

303
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.746
Well, the Institute's mandate
is to protect the oceans, right?

304
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:21.375
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

305
00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.252
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

306
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.294
Oh, good.

307
00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.839
Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

308
00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:32.052
You're taking bigger and bigger risks
each time you go out.

309
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.012
Well, I guess we both know about that.

310
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.182
It's not the same.

311
00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:40.269
With me, there's a calculation of risks.

312
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:43.564
Not that I see.

313
00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:58.954
Do you miss your mom, big fish?

314
00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:02.875
-(man) Dr. Howard.
-(indistinct chatter)

315
00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.127
Are you ready for Mana One?

316
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.044
(in Mandarin)

317
00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:09.089
Yes, whenever you're ready?

318
00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:13.051
These new suits will let us travel
anywhere and at any depth underwater.

319
00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:15.387
(Meiying in English) Say.

320
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:17.514
-(beeps)
-(machine whirrs)

321
00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:18.473
-What?
-(yelping)

322
00:18:18.557 --> 00:18:19.474
(in Mandarin)

323
00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:20.475
No worries, no worries.

324
00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:29.776
Mom and Grandpa talked about you
all the time.

325
00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.488
Nothing good I suppose.

326
00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:35.616
Wanna guess?

327
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.411
See this scar?

328
00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.956
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

329
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.043
So I snuck out to swim with my friends
on the rocky shores...

330
00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.879
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

331
00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.465
When I returned home
my father taught me a real lesson.

332
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.009
Grandpa?

333
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.177
Of course.

334
00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:57.137
He was kind to you
because you're his granddaughter,

335
00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.598
but he was tough on me.

336
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:04.978
So after college, I started a company.

337
00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.524
I wanted to get away from him.

338
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.361
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather for many years.

339
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.322
Then he asked your mom
to bring me this calligraphy.

340
00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:18.283
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

341
00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.994
I thought it was a form of ridicule...

342
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.750
but I came to realize that he wanted me
to find my own way.

343
00:19:27.918 --> 00:19:29.086
(helicopter whirring)

344
00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.045
(in Mandarin)

345
00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.547
Like the dragon...

346
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.383
I hope you can find your own fate.

347
00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:36.593
(in English) Ground crew,
we're approaching Mana One.

348
00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:38.679
(crewmember on radio) Hey, Rigas.
Good to have you back.

349
00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:40.514
(Rigas) I missed you guys.

350
00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:41.765
(crewmember)
Are you ready to do some diving?

351
00:19:42.808 --> 00:19:43.809
(Rigas) You know it.

352
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.903
(suspenseful music playing)

353
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.663
(beeping)

354
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.898
(snarling)

355
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:44.494
-(wind whooshing)
-(water splashing)

356
00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:49.458
(Mac over radio) Morning, everyone.
Let's get this show underwater.

357
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.252
(Jess over radio) Dive 1 and Dive 2,
descend to 25,000 feet.

358
00:20:52.377 --> 00:20:54.254
We're exploring Area 19.

359
00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:56.423
Collecting rock samples
and logging any new species.

360
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.800
(DJ over radio)
Diving in T-minus 20 minutes.

361
00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:02.554
All eyes open for a straightforward
sweep and scan. The usual.

362
00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:04.640
Yeah. There's no usual down there.

363
00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.308
-System's up.
-(system powering up)

364
00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:11.605
What's with all these toys you have
hanging around your console, Lance?

365
00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:12.856
(gas hisses)

366
00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.067
They're not toys, they're figurines.

367
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.528
(Mac) They are definitely toys, Lance.

368
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:18.612
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

369
00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.285
(crank whirring)

370
00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:26.828
(Jess) Ready for the drop, guys?

371
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.667
(rumbling)

372
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:53.355
So, are you and Sal, like,
Comic-Con guys or what?

373
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.357
(inhales) Uh...

374
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.817
Absolutely right, yeah.

375
00:21:56.942 --> 00:21:59.111
Do you, um, dress up?

376
00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.863
Uh, yeah.

377
00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:03.782
Don't get him started, unless you
want to see a million photographs.

378
00:22:03.866 --> 00:22:05.951
(Rigas) Oh, yes, please.

379
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.536
(Jonas) Stay focused, guys.

380
00:22:09.872 --> 00:22:11.874
(DJ) Passing 17,000...

381
00:22:11.957 --> 00:22:13.542
(Jess) Telemetry's good.

382
00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:18.755
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

383
00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.471
Passing 18,000 feet.

384
00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:28.098
All systems nominal.

385
00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:31.727
Looking good, team. Let's pull up
the grids we're gonna map today.

386
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.811
(Lance over radio) Area 19.

387
00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:35.105
When are we going to look
at something different?

388
00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:37.065
(Curtis) You know, there's like
100 more sectors to explore.

389
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:39.610
Jonas, can you confirm O2 levels?

390
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.696
(Jonas) Consumption is 11%
over mission spec.

391
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.199
Guess Rigas is nervous.

392
00:22:45.282 --> 00:22:46.992
More like you're a mouth breather.

393
00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:48.368
-(chuckles)
-He totally is.

394
00:22:48.452 --> 00:22:49.786
(Rigas) Can feel the breeze
from over here.

395
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.704
(Jonas) Yeah.

396
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.457
Firstly, it's called a deviated septum.

397
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.919
Second, I distinctly remember deviating it

398
00:22:57.002 --> 00:22:58.253
while saving your ungrateful ass

399
00:22:58.337 --> 00:23:01.089
from a 70-foot megalodon.

400
00:23:01.173 --> 00:23:02.841
Passing 20,000 feet.

401
00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:04.510
Approaching the thermocline.

402
00:23:07.638 --> 00:23:09.640
Checking O2 lines and tank pressure.

403
00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:10.599
(Sal) If there was a leak,

404
00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:12.226
there would be a fluctuation
on the readings.

405
00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:13.310
I'm not seeing anything here.

406
00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:15.854
(Curtis) Check the pressure
on the auxiliary O2 tanks.

407
00:23:15.938 --> 00:23:17.314
Okay, I'll check.

408
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:19.650
That's not the problem.

409
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:21.860
Uh, Jonas?

410
00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:25.030
Meiying?

411
00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.031
(in Mandarin)

412
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.115
What the hell are you doing?

413
00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:28.242
(in English) You gotta be kidding me.

414
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.996
I see that you're angry.

415
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.583
But I believe that this is a reasonable
and responsible decision.

416
00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:37.543
Stop the dive.

417
00:23:37.626 --> 00:23:39.336
(submarine slows down)

418
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.546
Full stop.

419
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:42.923
But before you start yelling,
can I just say...

420
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:44.007
(sighs)

421
00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:46.426
I did all kinds of stupid things
when I was 14.

422
00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:48.387
And look how I turned out.

423
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.138
We're surfacing.

424
00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:51.807
(Meiying) But I don't see
what the problem is.

425
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.518
This is your 26th trench dive
without incident.

426
00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:56.353
Subs have electric
predator countermeasures,

427
00:23:56.436 --> 00:23:57.646
and emergency dive suits.

428
00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:58.730
Which you don't have.

429
00:23:58.814 --> 00:24:00.148
Actually...

430
00:24:01.984 --> 00:24:04.611
I packed one while you were
doing the pre-dive meeting.

431
00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:05.821
You know,

432
00:24:05.904 --> 00:24:10.951
now's maybe a good time
to sit down and be quiet for a minute.

433
00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:12.995
I can do a seatbelt by myself, you know.

434
00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:13.912
(Jonas) I know you can.

435
00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:14.997
(Jiuming over radio) Jonas.

436
00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:17.165
It's not your call, Jiuming.

437
00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:18.333
We've got company.

438
00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:19.793
(scanner buzzing)

439
00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:21.128
Guys, it's a meg.

440
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:23.005
-(alarm blaring)
-(Sal) Approaching fast.

441
00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:25.674
That's not possible,
they can't go through the thermocline.

442
00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:28.468
It's not coming from the thermocline.
I'm tracking it from the shore.

443
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.763
Dive! Flank speed!

444
00:24:32.306 --> 00:24:34.057
(Sal) Engaging. Rerouting battery array.

445
00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:36.310
(Rigas) Hold on.

446
00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.189
Charging the predator countermeasures.

447
00:24:40.272 --> 00:24:41.773
We'll be dead before they're online.

448
00:24:42.566 --> 00:24:43.984
Thermocline's our only hope.

449
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:46.111
I'm reading Haiqi's tracker.

450
00:24:47.613 --> 00:24:49.698
(sighs) Impossible.

451
00:24:49.823 --> 00:24:51.575
(DJ over radio)
Well, impossible just got possible.

452
00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:53.035
Five hundred meters to the thermocline.

453
00:24:53.118 --> 00:24:54.119
(Lance over radio) Haiqi's closing fast.

454
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.121
(Sal) One hundred meters.

455
00:24:56.205 --> 00:24:57.206
She's right above us.

456
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:58.832
(beeping)

457
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:00.792
Come on, come on!

458
00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:02.336
(Rigas over radio)
Entering the thermocline.

459
00:25:03.086 --> 00:25:04.338
Dive 1, Dive 2.

460
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:06.006
Switch to low-frequency light,

461
00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:07.841
you don't want to attract any more megs.

462
00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:10.344
(Jiuming over radio) I've lost her.
She can't follow us through.

463
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:11.428
(Lance over radio) Can she?

464
00:25:11.512 --> 00:25:12.471
(Rigas over radio) Going dark.

465
00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:15.557
I've never crossed the thermocline
at 60 knots.

466
00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:19.853
(Jess) Careful, you don't want
to burn out the engines.

467
00:25:19.937 --> 00:25:22.481
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
break the pretty toys.

468
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:32.741
Yes.

469
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:37.996
-She's still on us.
-(Rigas sighs)

470
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:38.914
(Jiuming over radio) Thirty seconds.

471
00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:40.374
For the countermeasures.

472
00:25:40.457 --> 00:25:41.416
Evasive.

473
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.751
She must have
followed our heat signature.

474
00:25:52.928 --> 00:25:54.596
-(Meiying yelps)
-(submarine rumbling)

475
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:04.898
(Rigas over radio) How did your pet
shark get down here, Jiuming?

476
00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:08.110
(Jiuming) She must have escaped.
How did that happen?

477
00:26:08.193 --> 00:26:10.112
(Sal) Predator countermeasures active.

478
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:11.238
(electricity crackling)

479
00:26:11.947 --> 00:26:13.031
Proximity alert.

480
00:26:13.115 --> 00:26:13.991
Megs.

481
00:26:17.327 --> 00:26:18.745
No way.

482
00:26:29.673 --> 00:26:31.717
(Rigas) That's the biggest meg
I've ever seen.

483
00:26:33.343 --> 00:26:35.137
(Jonas) Biggest meg anyone's ever seen.

484
00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:37.890
That's gotta be the apex predator.

485
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:44.396
(Jiuming over radio)
Incredible. Megs are solitary.

486
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:46.231
It's like they're being called.

487
00:26:47.983 --> 00:26:51.320
I'm changing the dive plan.
We have to see what they're up to.

488
00:26:51.403 --> 00:26:52.905
And what about Meiying?

489
00:26:53.488 --> 00:26:55.115
Well, I vote we go.

490
00:26:55.991 --> 00:26:57.075
I wasn't asking you.

491
00:26:57.993 --> 00:26:59.953
(Jiuming) Oxygen reserves
are at maximum.

492
00:27:00.037 --> 00:27:02.247
Predator countermeasures are deployed.

493
00:27:02.998 --> 00:27:04.875
Right now we are perfectly safe.

494
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.293
Right now, yeah.

495
00:27:07.753 --> 00:27:10.547
If I see anything dangerous,
I'm pulling the plug.

496
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:13.050
(Jiuming) Mac, we're changing
the mission profile.

497
00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:15.469
Proceeding on heading 227.

498
00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:18.055
Now they're already off mission.
They need to stay on course.

499
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.474
Jonas, you're going way outside
the sector we have already mapped.

500
00:27:20.557 --> 00:27:22.267
(Jiuming) This is
an exploration mission.

501
00:27:22.392 --> 00:27:23.477
Let's explore.

502
00:27:25.145 --> 00:27:26.021
Copy that.

503
00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:27.397
-(sighs)
-Eyes open, watch your backs.

504
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:28.941
Really, Mac?

505
00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:32.444
We're gonna follow some giant sharks
to a unknown sector?

506
00:27:33.237 --> 00:27:34.571
(clicks tongue) Man...

507
00:27:35.364 --> 00:27:37.282
This some dumbass shit, mark my words.

508
00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:43.997
(automated voice speaking)
Entering Sector 21.

509
00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:03.267
Commencing geographical scan.

510
00:28:05.018 --> 00:28:06.144
It's so beautiful.

511
00:28:08.397 --> 00:28:10.357
Your mom loved this place
more than anything.

512
00:28:11.942 --> 00:28:13.652
I'm glad I finally get to see it.

513
00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:17.155
Don't get used to it.

514
00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:19.700
You're grounded for the rest of your life.

515
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:22.578
(Meiying) I love you, too.

516
00:28:22.703 --> 00:28:23.954
(Jonas chuckles)

517
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:26.665
(Lance over radio)
Haiqi 400 meters ahead and holding.

518
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:28.834
(Meiying over radio)
Where are we going now?

519
00:28:28.917 --> 00:28:30.210
(Ragis over radio) Into the unknown.

520
00:28:30.836 --> 00:28:32.546
(Jiuming over radio)
That's what we came for.

521
00:28:33.672 --> 00:28:35.174
I've got Haiqi's tracker ahead.

522
00:28:35.257 --> 00:28:36.842
Looks like she's circling.

523
00:28:39.595 --> 00:28:41.680
(sonar beeping)

524
00:28:48.979 --> 00:28:49.813
Look up.

525
00:28:50.439 --> 00:28:52.733
It's some instinctual gathering.

526
00:28:52.816 --> 00:28:54.109
(Rigas) Incredible.

527
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.737
They're here to mate.

528
00:28:58.197 --> 00:29:00.574
This is why Haiqi
has been acting strangely.

529
00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:03.160
Oh, great. More megs.

530
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:06.830
-(scanner beeping rapidly)
-(alarm blaring)

531
00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:11.960
The scanner's detecting
an abnormal structure.

532
00:29:19.927 --> 00:29:21.136
No way.

533
00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:23.472
(Curtis) Is that a wreck?

534
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.685
It's some kind of sea floor station.

535
00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:30.479
What could they be doing down here?

536
00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:36.276
Rigas, run all spectrums.

537
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.948
(Rigas) No, that's no wreck.
I'm getting heat signatures off it.

538
00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:43.283
Just can't see what's inside.

539
00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:45.869
(Jiuming over radio)
Multiple airlocks, power generation.

540
00:29:45.953 --> 00:29:47.996
The resources needed is staggering.

541
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:52.417
Who would even have that technology?

542
00:29:52.584 --> 00:29:53.961
(sonar beeping)

543
00:29:54.878 --> 00:29:56.296
Sonar says there's something above us.

544
00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:58.632
It looks like a submarine.

545
00:29:58.757 --> 00:30:00.175
Let's take a look.

546
00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:03.345
(automated voice speaking) Charges set.
Priming zone for detonation.

547
00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:05.973
(Montes) Come on.
We need to blow this ridge.

548
00:30:06.098 --> 00:30:07.516
(diver) Yeah, okay, okay.

549
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:09.518
We don't wanna be down here
any longer than needs be.

550
00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:15.566
(Montes) Yeah, well, this is
the only place to mine this stuff.

551
00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:18.735
Slow and steady.

552
00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:21.613
(diver) Hey, Montes.
Why do you get to stay in the submarine?

553
00:30:23.198 --> 00:30:24.408
(Montes) It's good to be the king.

554
00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:27.160
(automated voice speaking)
Incoming object detected.

555
00:30:27.244 --> 00:30:29.037
(sonar beeping)

556
00:30:29.913 --> 00:30:31.665
(Montes) Zoom in 400%.

557
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.757
(speaking Spanish)

558
00:30:42.718 --> 00:30:44.094
(Montes in English)
Mana One crew is below us.

559
00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:47.848
There's no way
they haven't seen the station.

560
00:30:47.931 --> 00:30:49.766
(diver) What are we gonna do?

561
00:30:49.892 --> 00:30:51.602
(Montes)
I'm arming the explosives right now.

562
00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:54.354
-You have to get out.
-(diver) What? Wait.

563
00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:55.564
No, you can't do that.

564
00:30:55.647 --> 00:30:57.482
There isn't time.
You know there isn't time.

565
00:30:57.566 --> 00:30:59.151
It will take ten minutes to get clear.

566
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:01.320
Montes!

567
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.413
-Sorry, guys.
-(diver) Montes! Montes, don't do it!

568
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.168
(Sal over radio) What was that?

569
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.629
(explosion)

570
00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:19.922
Landslide!

571
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:22.216
I can't get ahead of it.
I'm gonna have to go through.

572
00:31:36.146 --> 00:31:38.315
-(Montes grunting)
-(alarm blaring)

573
00:31:45.113 --> 00:31:45.948
(grunts)

574
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.210
(Jess) Guys? What's happening?

575
00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:00.003
I'm reading a thermocline breach.

576
00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:02.297
Something's ripped a giant hole in it.

577
00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:15.519
Rerouting the thrusters.
This is all we've got.

578
00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:18.021
(yelps)

579
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:22.860
Vertical control is down.

580
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:25.153
Hydraulics are non-responsive.

581
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:30.033
We're pinned.

582
00:32:31.952 --> 00:32:32.953
(Jiuming) Coming in.

583
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.874
-Hold us steady.
-(inhales) Yeah.

584
00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:42.713
(Jonas over radio) Jiuming.
Sixty degrees down.

585
00:32:42.796 --> 00:32:43.672
Two feet forward.

586
00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:48.635
Jiuming!

587
00:32:52.055 --> 00:32:53.432
(alarm blaring)

588
00:32:57.603 --> 00:32:58.729
Go, go, go!

589
00:33:00.439 --> 00:33:01.857
Full thrust! Full thrust!

590
00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:12.993
-(Jiuming gasps)
-(grunts)

591
00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:14.286
(Jonas) Jiuming!

592
00:33:15.913 --> 00:33:16.997
(Meiying) No!

593
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:29.635
(DJ) There's no telemetry.

594
00:33:31.762 --> 00:33:32.888
Dive 1,

595
00:33:32.971 --> 00:33:34.306
Dive 2. Do you copy?

596
00:33:35.891 --> 00:33:37.518
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

597
00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:41.271
(DJ) We've got nothing here.

598
00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:42.856
Keep trying, DJ.

599
00:33:43.023 --> 00:33:45.609
Jess, prep the rescue sub. Stat.

600
00:33:45.692 --> 00:33:48.028
-Ugh, what happened?
-I don't know.

601
00:33:50.155 --> 00:33:51.406
How do we know if they're still alive?

602
00:33:52.074 --> 00:33:53.158
Prep the rescue vehicle.

603
00:33:55.827 --> 00:33:56.620
(DJ) Dive 1,

604
00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:58.247
Dive 2. Do you copy?

605
00:33:59.248 --> 00:34:00.499
Come on, Jonas.

606
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.211
(Jonas' voice echoing) Meiying.

607
00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:06.338
(Meiying coughs)

608
00:34:06.421 --> 00:34:07.506
Meiying.

609
00:34:09.424 --> 00:34:11.009
-Meiying.
-(Meiying) What happened?

610
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.345
(Jonas) Took a nasty hit.

611
00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:16.348
Uncle Jiuming?

612
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.141
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

613
00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:20.102
-Where is he?
-We can't raise him.

614
00:34:21.436 --> 00:34:24.273
Hey. We work the problems one by one.

615
00:34:25.315 --> 00:34:28.819
We do what's in front of us,
and then we do the next thing.

616
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.238
We're gonna be okay.

617
00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:33.782
(Jess) Mac!

618
00:34:34.533 --> 00:34:36.118
The rescue sub isn't working.

619
00:34:36.785 --> 00:34:40.664
The battery array was deliberately
shorted out. It looks like sabotage.

620
00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:41.665
How's that possible?

621
00:34:41.748 --> 00:34:44.459
This isn't a secure area,
there are 30 people who work here.

622
00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:45.544
Well, how long to fix it?

623
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:48.505
It's the control boards, Mac.
There is no fixing it.

624
00:34:51.842 --> 00:34:54.678
-(Rigas) Try it now.
-(Meiying) What's our status?

625
00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:55.721
(Jonas) No comms, no heat.

626
00:34:56.805 --> 00:34:58.265
We're losing air fast.

627
00:34:58.974 --> 00:35:01.393
-(Rigas) This isn't working.
-Flood in my extra O2.

628
00:35:02.895 --> 00:35:03.854
Already done.

629
00:35:03.937 --> 00:35:06.190
(Sal) Yeah, I have got one last idea.

630
00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:08.192
Route the power through the heating cell.

631
00:35:08.275 --> 00:35:10.027
(radio static)

632
00:35:14.573 --> 00:35:15.949
I got Dive 1. Mac.

633
00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:17.284
-I got Dive 1.
-Jonas?

634
00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:18.493
(Jonas chuckles)

635
00:35:18.577 --> 00:35:20.204
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

636
00:35:20.287 --> 00:35:22.247
(Mac) Not as good as it is
to hear yours, brother.

637
00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:23.665
Talk to me.

638
00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:25.334
It ain't good.

639
00:35:25.417 --> 00:35:28.003
Almost every system is down
and we're losing air fast.

640
00:35:28.795 --> 00:35:33.133
We'll get into the emergency dive suits,
and we're gonna need a ride up.

641
00:35:34.384 --> 00:35:35.385
Jonas...

642
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:37.763
it's not gonna be possible.

643
00:35:39.097 --> 00:35:40.474
What are you talking about?

644
00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:41.975
(Mac) The battery array.

645
00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:44.353
It shorted out the control board
in the rescue sub.

646
00:35:44.436 --> 00:35:45.896
We're investigating it now.

647
00:35:49.399 --> 00:35:50.400
Jonas?

648
00:35:51.693 --> 00:35:52.778
Jonas, can you hear me?

649
00:35:54.655 --> 00:35:56.240
Jonas, we can't get to you.

650
00:35:57.824 --> 00:35:59.034
(breathing heavily)

651
00:36:00.035 --> 00:36:01.078
We're gonna walk.

652
00:36:03.038 --> 00:36:06.291
We're gonna walk back across the trench.
Make it into that sea floor station.

653
00:36:06.375 --> 00:36:10.003
And we're gonna get inside.
And then we're gonna get to the surface.

654
00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:12.548
Those suits have two hours of air tops.

655
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:15.008
They're only designed
for brief extravehicular work.

656
00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:17.386
We'll go slow and steady. They'll hold.

657
00:36:17.469 --> 00:36:18.679
It's three kilometers.

658
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:20.639
You'll be defenseless out there.

659
00:36:21.431 --> 00:36:22.558
What do you want from me, Mac?

660
00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:25.143
This is what we got,
and this is what we're gonna do.

661
00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:29.314
Half our team is dead...

662
00:36:30.107 --> 00:36:31.400
and I'm not losing the other half.

663
00:36:37.364 --> 00:36:39.074
(automated voice speaking)
Beginning suit initialization.

664
00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:41.994
Joint actuators functioning.

665
00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:44.872
Ultrasonic signal communications online.

666
00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:47.291
Initialization complete.

667
00:36:50.335 --> 00:36:52.087
Abandoning Dive 1, Mac.

668
00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:53.755
(air hisses)

669
00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:56.341
The radios won't relay to the surface,
so we're going dark.

670
00:36:57.009 --> 00:36:58.177
Talk to you on the other side.

671
00:36:58.886 --> 00:37:00.012
Godspeed, Jonas.

672
00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:08.854
(automated voice speaking)
Emergency escape initiated.

673
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:55.526
(Jiuming) Hey. Whoa.

674
00:37:56.818 --> 00:37:58.237
Almost killed you.

675
00:37:59.279 --> 00:38:00.322
The hell are you doing?

676
00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:02.157
Saving your ass.

677
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:03.867
And walking back to that station.

678
00:38:05.577 --> 00:38:06.745
What are you doing?

679
00:38:07.412 --> 00:38:10.582
Saving your ass.
And walking back to that station.

680
00:38:11.416 --> 00:38:12.918
-Don't have much time.
-Let's get going.

681
00:38:15.796 --> 00:38:16.755
-Jiu.
-Oh!

682
00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:18.465
(in Mandarin)

683
00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:19.633
Uncle, I thought you --

684
00:38:20.843 --> 00:38:22.678
You're not going to get rid of me
that easily.

685
00:38:24.805 --> 00:38:25.681
(Rigas in English) Hey.

686
00:38:25.764 --> 00:38:28.016
Hey. Let me check.

687
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.059
(automated voice speaking) Air left...

688
00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:31.478
Hey, you need to calm down or you're
gonna run out of oxygen, Lance.

689
00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:33.647
I don't think I can.

690
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.440
(Rigas) Think of it as cosplay.

691
00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:39.111
(Sal) Or we could be paintballing.

692
00:38:39.194 --> 00:38:40.946
(Curtis) Like the ultimate
team-building exercise.

693
00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:43.073
(Jonas) We need to cover distance
while the megs are still occupied.

694
00:38:43.156 --> 00:38:44.616
(automated voice speaking)
Three kilometers to destination.

695
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.411
(Meiying) Away from the megs
is fine by me.

696
00:38:47.494 --> 00:38:50.205
(Jiuming) We're a strong group.
We can do this.

697
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.917
Amazing.

698
00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:56.712
Lighting courtesy of Mother Nature.

699
00:38:57.754 --> 00:39:00.716
(Sal) It's incredible,
there are new species all around us.

700
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.552
Hey. Look.

701
00:39:03.635 --> 00:39:05.470
Look at this. It's beautiful.

702
00:39:09.057 --> 00:39:10.684
(Lance) Hello, my little biolum...

703
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.978
(screaming)

704
00:39:13.103 --> 00:39:14.938
There's a snake! There's a snake!

705
00:39:15.022 --> 00:39:17.149
Get this monster off my head!

706
00:39:17.232 --> 00:39:18.275
(screams)

707
00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:22.237
(grunts, breathes heavily)

708
00:39:22.321 --> 00:39:23.947
No touching stuff.

709
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:25.199
(Lance) He started it.

710
00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:31.413
(Mac) Everyone clear the station.
DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

711
00:39:31.496 --> 00:39:33.332
(DJ) Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

712
00:39:33.415 --> 00:39:34.666
At best, it'll take another hour

713
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.626
for them to cover the distance.

714
00:39:35.709 --> 00:39:37.002
Listen up.

715
00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:39.671
We know there's some kind
of rogue operation in the trench.

716
00:39:39.755 --> 00:39:41.798
Now some bastard's got his fingers
in our operation here.

717
00:39:42.549 --> 00:39:46.178
That sub was definitely sabotaged,
so we've got a mole on the station.

718
00:39:46.303 --> 00:39:48.430
DJ, I want you to pull
all surveillance footage

719
00:39:48.555 --> 00:39:51.058
from the sub bay for the last 24 hours.

720
00:39:51.183 --> 00:39:52.684
Jess, run the personnel files
on the crew,

721
00:39:52.768 --> 00:39:54.144
look for anything suspect.

722
00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:57.356
We're gonna get these sons of bitches,
but we have to watch our own backs.

723
00:39:58.065 --> 00:40:00.901
One of us mans the DCC at all times,
understood?

724
00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:02.236
Yes.

725
00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:07.991
(Rigas breathing heavily) Is it just me,

726
00:40:08.784 --> 00:40:10.577
or does walking
three kilometers underwater

727
00:40:10.702 --> 00:40:11.912
sound like hard work?

728
00:40:11.995 --> 00:40:14.331
(Curtis) It certainly
wasn't on my to-do list.

729
00:40:17.584 --> 00:40:19.253
(Lance) Baby octopi.

730
00:40:20.671 --> 00:40:22.631
So many colors, it's incredible.

731
00:40:22.714 --> 00:40:24.758
(breathing heavily)

732
00:40:26.468 --> 00:40:27.886
(Meiying) Anybody wanna play a game?

733
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.347
-(Jiuming) A game?
-(Rigas) This isn't a game.

734
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.266
She means to keep our minds occupied.

735
00:40:33.225 --> 00:40:35.727
(Rigas) Right now, my mind
is pretty damn occupied.

736
00:40:45.612 --> 00:40:47.322
(breathes heavily, yelps)

737
00:40:49.116 --> 00:40:50.993
(panting)

738
00:40:55.163 --> 00:40:56.748
(Lance screaming)

739
00:40:56.832 --> 00:40:59.293
There's a, there's a, it's... (screams)

740
00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:01.044
Lance?

741
00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:02.129
What was it?

742
00:41:02.212 --> 00:41:04.965
-(Curtis) I didn't see.
-(Sal) Where's Lance?

743
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.091
Is it a meg?

744
00:41:08.552 --> 00:41:10.762
Something's happened to him, I know it.

745
00:41:10.846 --> 00:41:11.763
(Jiuming) Lance?

746
00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:14.308
(breathing heavily)

747
00:41:15.642 --> 00:41:17.769
(Sal) No. Oh, no.

748
00:41:18.478 --> 00:41:19.688
We have to keep moving.

749
00:41:19.771 --> 00:41:21.940
No, we can't just leave him out there.

750
00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:24.067
We need to find him! Please!

751
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:25.485
-Jiuming.
-I'm sorry.

752
00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:26.695
(Sal sobbing)

753
00:41:26.778 --> 00:41:27.613
He's gone.

754
00:41:30.115 --> 00:41:33.285
Rigas, cover our six.
Shoot anything that moves.

755
00:41:35.454 --> 00:41:37.122
You bet your ass I will.

756
00:41:38.916 --> 00:41:40.125
(electricity crackling)

757
00:41:43.337 --> 00:41:45.005
(tool clanking)

758
00:41:45.923 --> 00:41:46.924
(Montes grunts)

759
00:41:53.722 --> 00:41:55.015
(automated voice speaking) Comms online.

760
00:41:55.682 --> 00:41:56.934
(line connects)

761
00:41:58.477 --> 00:41:59.811
What happened to you?

762
00:42:00.812 --> 00:42:03.440
(Montes) The Mana One crew
stumbled upon our station.

763
00:42:03.524 --> 00:42:05.234
I took them out with a landslide.

764
00:42:05.317 --> 00:42:07.903
Okay, this is out of control.

765
00:42:07.986 --> 00:42:10.030
(scoffs) You authorized me to do

766
00:42:10.113 --> 00:42:12.199
whatever's necessary
to protect our operation.

767
00:42:12.282 --> 00:42:14.159
No. (chuckles)

768
00:42:15.118 --> 00:42:19.164
They are not dead.
They are walking right now

769
00:42:19.248 --> 00:42:20.249
to the station.

770
00:42:20.916 --> 00:42:21.792
If they get there,

771
00:42:22.543 --> 00:42:23.836
we are screwed.

772
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.671
(sighs)

773
00:42:27.047 --> 00:42:30.050
(Rigas) There's still a kilometer to go,
straight through that valley,

774
00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:32.094
and we don't have the bioluminescence
to cover us.

775
00:42:32.177 --> 00:42:34.096
(Jiuming) We're going to be
totally exposed out there.

776
00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:35.013
We don't have a choice.

777
00:42:35.097 --> 00:42:37.516
We only have enough air
to go straight through.

778
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.436
(breathes deeply) Let's keep our lights
on low spectrum.

779
00:42:42.396 --> 00:42:44.314
(Rigas) Yeah, we don't want to attract
the megs.

780
00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:46.108
(automated voice speaking)
One kilometer to destination.

781
00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:49.903
-O2 check?
-(Meiying) 65%.

782
00:42:50.529 --> 00:42:51.321
(Rigas) 50.

783
00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:52.906
(Sal) 26%.

784
00:42:53.657 --> 00:42:55.075
It's not gonna be enough.
(breathing heavily)

785
00:42:55.158 --> 00:42:56.743
(Rigas) Look at me. Look at me.

786
00:42:56.827 --> 00:42:58.745
Look at me, okay? Focus, okay?

787
00:42:58.829 --> 00:43:01.623
You can do this. Remember the training.

788
00:43:03.292 --> 00:43:04.793
(Jonas) Anything on sonar?

789
00:43:04.877 --> 00:43:07.296
(Jiuming) I got something,
right at the edge of my range.

790
00:43:08.297 --> 00:43:09.548
Keeps going in and out.

791
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:11.675
(sonar beeping)

792
00:43:13.343 --> 00:43:14.428
Stalking us.

793
00:43:23.187 --> 00:43:24.313
(automated voice speaking)
Proximity alert.

794
00:43:26.607 --> 00:43:27.441
(Sal) What is it?

795
00:43:27.524 --> 00:43:29.443
(all grunting)

796
00:43:33.572 --> 00:43:35.032
(Jonas) It's just a shoal of fish.

797
00:43:35.115 --> 00:43:36.033
(all panting)

798
00:43:36.116 --> 00:43:37.367
(Jonas) Stay calm, everyone.

799
00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:39.786
-(Jiuming) Are you okay?
-Yeah.

800
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:40.746
(Jonas) Keep moving.

801
00:43:43.749 --> 00:43:44.875
Ayo, Mac.

802
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:47.920
We got jack on the security footage.
Somebody deleted it.

803
00:43:48.003 --> 00:43:50.255
-For the sub bay?
-For the whole damn station.

804
00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:52.508
They're good,
but they don't know everything.

805
00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:54.676
There's a satellite uplink
with an encrypted backup.

806
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.471
I'm gonna go to the server room,
see if I can pull it down.

807
00:43:57.596 --> 00:43:58.555
Time?

808
00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:00.474
One hour, 50.
They'll be out of air soon.

809
00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:02.518
I'm scanning all channels,
but nothing yet.

810
00:44:07.856 --> 00:44:10.567
That's it. Maybe 400 meters.

811
00:44:16.073 --> 00:44:18.617
(automated voice speaking) Warning.
Entering oxygen reserves.

812
00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:19.743
You can do this.

813
00:44:20.494 --> 00:44:21.787
-Yeah?
-Yeah. (breath trembling)

814
00:44:22.621 --> 00:44:24.122
(Jiuming) I'm getting a reading.

815
00:44:24.248 --> 00:44:25.874
Many contacts to our right.

816
00:44:27.209 --> 00:44:28.377
Coming in fast.

817
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:32.256
What, megs?

818
00:44:33.006 --> 00:44:36.176
No. Smaller. Faster.

819
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.432
Everybody make it to the station!
Go, move!

820
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.226
(automated voice) Warning.
Oxygen level low.

821
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:45.477
-(Rigas) Come on.
-(Sal) I'm out of air.

822
00:44:46.854 --> 00:44:48.397
(Jiuming) They're coming over the ridge!

823
00:44:50.274 --> 00:44:51.066
(snarling)

824
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.111
What are those things?

825
00:44:54.194 --> 00:44:55.362
(Jiuming) It's too far.

826
00:44:55.487 --> 00:44:57.114
(Jonas) We need to make a stand!

827
00:44:57.865 --> 00:44:58.907
Turn and fight!

828
00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:00.701
(creatures snarling)

829
00:45:04.496 --> 00:45:05.622
(grunting)

830
00:45:10.127 --> 00:45:11.128
(yells)

831
00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:14.756
Come on! Get off!

832
00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:16.967
(creature snarling)

833
00:45:17.718 --> 00:45:19.303
-(Meiying screams)
-Meiying!

834
00:45:19.386 --> 00:45:20.846
Help! Shoot their head!

835
00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:22.264
-Meiying!
-Uncle!

836
00:45:25.184 --> 00:45:26.560
(Jiuming grunts) I've got you!

837
00:45:26.643 --> 00:45:27.561
(in Mandarin) Hold on!

838
00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:29.354
(Meiying in English)
They're biting through the suit.

839
00:45:32.482 --> 00:45:33.817
(Jason) Meiying!

840
00:45:35.152 --> 00:45:36.945
(grunting)

841
00:45:37.654 --> 00:45:39.323

(groans)

844
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.704
-No. No.
-Hold on, Curtis!

845
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:48.332
(Sal) Too many!
We don't have a chance!

846
00:45:51.627 --> 00:45:53.212
(snarling)

847
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.388
(creatures screeching)

848
00:46:07.267 --> 00:46:08.477
Everybody stay back!

849
00:46:10.312 --> 00:46:11.480
Keep going!

850
00:46:19.238 --> 00:46:20.322
(Jonas) Jiuming!

851
00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:21.657
(Jiuming) There's no choice.

852
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.743
You really wanna die, don't you?

853
00:46:33.752 --> 00:46:35.754
(metal creaking)

854
00:46:35.838 --> 00:46:37.923

855
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.934
(Meiying shrieks)

856
00:46:49.726 --> 00:46:51.478
Gotta make it to the airlock!

857
00:47:04.825 --> 00:47:06.034
(automated voice speaking)
Warning. Low air.

858
00:47:06.118 --> 00:47:08.245
-It's no use. I'm holding you back.
-Low air.

859
00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:13.709
-It's not too far.
-(breathing heavily)

860
00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:14.960
You can make it!

861
00:47:15.043 --> 00:47:17.045
(automated voice speaking)
Warning. Low air.

862
00:47:17.129 --> 00:47:19.089
(Jiuming grunting)

863
00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:20.841
Warning. Low air.

864

(grunts)

865
00:47:22.259 --> 00:47:23.969
(automated voice speaking) Air depleted.

866
00:47:24.052 --> 00:47:25.512
(Sal screaming)

867
00:47:26.597 --> 00:47:27.639

(grunts, screaming)

869
00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:35.147
(Meiying) Uncle!

870
00:47:35.981 --> 00:47:37.399
(automated voice speaking)
Visor failure imminent.

871
00:47:37.482 --> 00:47:38.609
(grunts)

872
00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:40.068
(Jonas) Jiuming!

(metal crashing)

876
00:47:46.575 --> 00:47:49.119
Okay. We gotta go.
We don't have a choice.

877
00:47:49.203 --> 00:47:50.871
(Jonas) He's coming back around!

878
00:47:50.954 --> 00:47:52.873
-(Curtis) Oh, God!
-(Jonas) Go, go, go!

879
00:47:55.375 --> 00:47:56.960
We have to do the override.

880
00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:01.215
-(Jiuming) Come on, hurry up.
-(Curtis and Rigas panting)

881
00:48:01.298 --> 00:48:02.466
Rigas, come on!

882
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:03.926
(suit beeping)

883
00:48:04.009 --> 00:48:05.177
(Rigas) You can do it. Get in!

884
00:48:07.179 --> 00:48:09.348
-(Meiying screams)
-Shut the door!

885
00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:11.350
Curtis, you'll be okay.

886
00:48:11.433 --> 00:48:12.601
(automated voice)
Suit implosion imminent.

887
00:48:12.684 --> 00:48:14.228
-Almost there. Almost there!
-(Curtis) Oh, my God.

888
00:48:16.188 --> 00:48:17.272
(all grunting)

889
00:48:17.356 --> 00:48:18.440
It's gonna implode.

890
00:48:18.524 --> 00:48:19.733
(Rigas) Depressurize the room!

891
00:48:19.858 --> 00:48:21.610
-(beeping continues)
-No, no, no.

892
00:48:21.693 --> 00:48:23.153
-(automated voice) Implosion imminent.
-No!

893
00:48:23.237 --> 00:48:24.238
(both scream)

894
00:49:05.404 --> 00:49:06.864
(Rigas) Son of a bitch!

895
00:49:07.322 --> 00:49:09.032
I hate these things!

896
00:49:10.534 --> 00:49:11.535
(Jonas) Hey, Rigas.

897
00:49:12.286 --> 00:49:13.745
Let's try to keep it together.

898
00:49:15.747 --> 00:49:17.082
We ain't out of the woods yet.

899
00:49:29.428 --> 00:49:30.888
(electricity buzzing)

900
00:49:35.392 --> 00:49:36.852
(footsteps approaching)

901
00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:46.278
Rigas.

902
00:49:58.498 --> 00:50:00.000
(Meiying) Where is everybody?

903
00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:15.516
(exhales sharply)

904
00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:17.351
What is that smell?

905
00:50:18.977 --> 00:50:20.270
Divers.

906
00:50:28.904 --> 00:50:30.072
Nobody home.

907
00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:32.533
(Rigas) I'll cover the door.

908
00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:40.165
Whoever's running this...

909
00:50:41.667 --> 00:50:42.918
is not our friend.

910
00:50:43.001 --> 00:50:45.629
We need to contact Mana One ASAP.
Think you can handle it?

911
00:50:45.712 --> 00:50:46.880
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

912
00:50:50.509 --> 00:50:51.885
What is this that they're mining?

913
00:50:52.678 --> 00:50:54.805
(Rigas) Whatever it is,
they're sending it up to the surface

914
00:50:54.888 --> 00:50:56.390
with these pods.

915
00:50:56.473 --> 00:50:57.766
(keyboard clacking)

916
00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.773
Mm. Rare earth metals.

917
00:51:05.983 --> 00:51:09.278
They're used in superconductors,
aerospace and quantum computing.

918
00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:13.657
This box alone
could be a billion dollars.

919
00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:16.368
"Billion" with a "B?"

920
00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:17.578
Yes.

921
00:51:17.661 --> 00:51:18.912
-(line connects)
-Mana One.

922
00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:20.664
Jonas. Comms are live.

923
00:51:25.586 --> 00:51:26.753
(Jonas) Come in.

924
00:51:26.837 --> 00:51:29.756
-It's Jonas. Getting this?
-Hey, you're alive.

925
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.175
What's your status?

926
00:51:32.259 --> 00:51:34.428
We lost Lance, Sal, and Curtis.

927
00:51:35.762 --> 00:51:37.347
We're at the station.

928
00:51:37.431 --> 00:51:39.224
It's a rogue mining operation.

929
00:51:39.766 --> 00:51:41.018
Is there anyone down there?

930
00:51:41.185 --> 00:51:42.561
(Jonas) Not that we've seen so far.

931
00:51:43.353 --> 00:51:46.148
They've infiltrated Mana One.
The rescue sub was sabotaged.

932
00:51:46.231 --> 00:51:48.192
-By who?
-We're working on it.

933
00:51:48.275 --> 00:51:49.818
But check this out.

934
00:51:49.943 --> 00:51:52.863
I was going over the video of when
you went over that station before.

935
00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:55.157
Look at the north side.

936
00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.078
(Jiuming) Looks like
emergency escape pods.

937
00:52:00.787 --> 00:52:03.040
(Meiying) It's the opposite side
from where we are.

938
00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:21.433
-(Meiying) Feels dead in here.
-Stay close.

939
00:52:24.686 --> 00:52:26.188
These are my designs.

940
00:52:27.314 --> 00:52:28.482
How do they have this?

941
00:52:41.036 --> 00:52:42.246
Looks like this is it.

942
00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:49.253
(Jiuming sighs)

943
00:52:53.674 --> 00:52:54.508
On three.

944
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:56.593
-Three.
-(both grunting)

945
00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:02.224
-(Jiuming) Again.
-It's not gonna work.

946
00:53:02.307 --> 00:53:03.934
(grunting)

947
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:14.653
After you.

948
00:53:17.698 --> 00:53:19.199
(Rigas) Ah, this is more like it.

949
00:53:20.325 --> 00:53:22.244
Let's crack open a pod
and get out of here.

950
00:53:24.705 --> 00:53:25.497
(Jiuming) Nothing here.

951
00:53:26.498 --> 00:53:27.875
These controls ain't working.

952
00:53:28.333 --> 00:53:29.710
We need to close the hatch.

953
00:53:29.793 --> 00:53:30.627
(Rigas) On it.

954
00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:37.426
Guys, that wasn't me.

955
00:53:39.595 --> 00:53:42.347
Jonas, now that I have you here,

956
00:53:42.431 --> 00:53:43.599
we need to talk candidly.

957
00:53:44.266 --> 00:53:46.643
I have full control of the station
and I've locked down this room.

958
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:49.771
-Jess?
-Your life is in my hands.

959
00:53:49.855 --> 00:53:51.106
What are you doing, Jess?

960
00:53:53.525 --> 00:53:54.818
These are your friends.

961
00:53:55.986 --> 00:53:57.446
They've been with you for years.

962
00:53:57.529 --> 00:54:00.032
I know it hurts. And we're talking

963
00:54:00.115 --> 00:54:02.201
because I'd prefer
we were on the same side.

964
00:54:02.284 --> 00:54:04.661
All making so much money,
it ceases to have meaning.

965
00:54:04.745 --> 00:54:06.038
You're offering us money?

966
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.001
Three of our friends
are dead because of you.

967
00:54:11.084 --> 00:54:12.586
You think I'm gonna forget about that?

968
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:18.884
No, no, no!
That's the first escape pod!

969
00:54:19.426 --> 00:54:20.719
Son of a bitch!

970
00:54:20.802 --> 00:54:24.431
(Jess) Rigas?
Rigas, you can save Meiying.

971
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.559
Take that speargun
and shoot Jonas in the heart.

972
00:54:49.581 --> 00:54:50.707
Don't shoot him.

973
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.256
(breathing heavily)

974
00:55:04.054 --> 00:55:04.972
Do it.

975
00:55:05.889 --> 00:55:06.932
Go ahead.

976
00:55:09.142 --> 00:55:10.936
It's the only way Meiying survives.

977
00:55:15.274 --> 00:55:16.400
Do it.

978
00:55:18.652 --> 00:55:19.528
Rigas!

979
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.989
Do it!

980
00:55:22.698 --> 00:55:25.367
(Rigas breathing heavily, shuddering)

981
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:27.411
-Do it!
-No. I'm sorry.

982
00:55:27.494 --> 00:55:30.289
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I can't, I can't, I can't.

983
00:55:39.006 --> 00:55:39.923
That was the last pod.

984
00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:44.094
I told you that wouldn't work.

985
00:55:45.095 --> 00:55:45.929
Put me on.

986
00:55:48.724 --> 00:55:50.893
(Driscoll sighs)
Sorry it had to come to this.

987
00:55:52.311 --> 00:55:53.312
So...

988
00:55:53.437 --> 00:55:55.230
we'll be back at work in a week

989
00:55:55.314 --> 00:55:59.109
using your technology
to take whatever we want.

990
00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:02.613
Your institute'll be
a platform that we use

991
00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:06.200
to plunder the ocean for decades.

992
00:56:06.283 --> 00:56:07.326
(in Mandarin) Karma will get you.

993
00:56:07.409 --> 00:56:09.912
(Driscoll) And before you start whining
about the ecosystem...

994
00:56:09.995 --> 00:56:12.372
Who cares? We'll make billions.

995
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:14.750
And no one is going
to see the damage we do.

996
00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:15.834
(in Mandarin) Shut up!

997
00:56:17.669 --> 00:56:20.672
(Driscoll) Jess, I've already dispatched
a clean-up crew to Mana One.

998
00:56:21.882 --> 00:56:22.925
Finish this.

999
00:56:25.302 --> 00:56:26.261
(metal thuds)

1000
00:56:27.304 --> 00:56:28.805
(Rigas) How do we open the door?

1001
00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:32.476
(Jiuming) If we could cut
the comm link to the surface...

1002
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:34.603
she couldn't control anything.

1003
00:56:34.686 --> 00:56:36.230
(Rigas) But it's back in the first room

1004
00:56:36.313 --> 00:56:37.814
and there's no getting through this door.

1005
00:56:38.565 --> 00:56:39.816
This airlock still works!

1006
00:56:40.484 --> 00:56:42.277
Why would you go through the airlock?
There's no pod.

1007
00:56:42.361 --> 00:56:44.738
I'll swim to the airlock
where we came in

1008
00:56:44.863 --> 00:56:46.198
and do the override.

1009
00:56:46.281 --> 00:56:48.492
You have no suit. How could it work?

1010
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:51.328
(Rigas) Water doesn't compress
under pressure,

1011
00:56:51.411 --> 00:56:53.413
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

1012
00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:56.792
he could survive 30, maybe 60 seconds
before he passes out.

1013
00:56:57.584 --> 00:56:58.669
-It is possible.
-(breathing heavily)

1014
00:57:01.129 --> 00:57:02.965
We work the problems one by one.

1015
00:57:04.675 --> 00:57:07.678
We do what's in front of us,
then we do the next thing.

1016
00:57:12.224 --> 00:57:14.476
(hatch whirring)

1017
00:57:16.019 --> 00:57:19.106
If anyone can do this, it's you.

1018
00:57:25.404 --> 00:57:26.613
(machine buzzing)

1019
00:57:36.957 --> 00:57:38.584
(Meiying) Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

1020
00:57:39.376 --> 00:57:41.170
(Rigas) It doesn't work like that.

1021
00:57:41.253 --> 00:57:43.755
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

1022
00:57:45.007 --> 00:57:47.926
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

1023
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.637
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

1024
00:58:17.706 --> 00:58:18.999
(handle rattles)

1025
00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:28.425
-(snarls)
-(muffled grunt)

1026
00:58:38.018 --> 00:58:40.145
-(hatch opens)
-(alarm blares)

1027
00:58:41.855 --> 00:58:43.565
(water gurgling)

1028
00:58:50.364 --> 00:58:51.949
(Montes) Hey there, tree hugger.

1029
00:58:56.203 --> 00:58:59.206
Jonas Taylor, eco-warrior,

1030
00:58:59.289 --> 00:59:00.791
fighting the good fight.

1031
00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:04.294
Well, guess what? You lost.

1032
00:59:05.212 --> 00:59:06.630
(chuckles)

1033
00:59:06.713 --> 00:59:08.590
-(coughing)
-(Montes speaking Spanish)

1034
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:12.427
(in English)
I spent two years in a Manila prison

1035
00:59:13.095 --> 00:59:17.933
after you and your eco-freak buddies
had our ship seized.

1036
00:59:18.767 --> 00:59:21.311
I thought about you every single day.

1037
00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:24.982
You don't even remember me, do you?

1038
00:59:25.566 --> 00:59:27.234
-Hmm?
-(breathes deeply)

1039
00:59:27.317 --> 00:59:28.110
(Montes) No?

1040
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:29.528
Montes.

1041
00:59:30.821 --> 00:59:33.740
There's a million scumbags
in this world. (grunts)

1042
00:59:36.827 --> 00:59:38.787
It's hard to keep track of all of 'em.

1043
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:41.582
(both grunting)

1044
00:59:54.636 --> 00:59:55.470
(in Mandarin)

1045
00:59:55.554 --> 00:59:56.680
I don't think I can make it!

1046
00:59:56.763 --> 00:59:58.348
You can do it. It's ok.

1047
00:59:58.974 --> 01:00:00.017
(grunts)

1048
01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:12.446
(grunting)

1049
01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:38.388
(grunts)

1050
01:00:47.397 --> 01:00:48.232
(in Mandarin)

1051
01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:49.358
-We're going to die!
-(in Chinese) It's ok, it's ok.

1052
01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:04.748
(both grunting)

1053
01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.341
(beeping)

1054
01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:30.232
(alarm blaring loudly)

1055
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:48.542
Meiying!

1056
01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:50.460
Meiying!

1057
01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:54.631
(coughing, gasping)

1058
01:01:54.715 --> 01:01:55.841
(gasping)

1059
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:02.973
(helicopter blades whirring)

1060
01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.648
Clean up crew approaching Mana One.

1061
01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:13.775
About time. We are on alert.

1062
01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:16.361
Everyone confined to their quarters.

1063
01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:20.824
We need to get control of Mana One
and dispose of any liabilities.

1064
01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:26.955
(DJ) What's the emergency?

1065
01:02:27.039 --> 01:02:28.373
I got into the security backup.

1066
01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:30.083
Look at this.

1067
01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.712
Jess disabled the rescue sub.

1068
01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:36.840
-What?
-Watch.

1069
01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:40.344
Like she could be repairing it, right?
But no, wait.

1070
01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:44.306
(DJ gasps)

1071
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:45.974
(Jonas) It's Montes' sub.

1072
01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:47.601
That's our ride out of here.

1073
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:55.484
(beeping)

1074
01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:57.110
There's a leak in the hydraulics.

1075
01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:58.654
Predator countermeasures are down.

1076
01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.948
We'll never make it past the megs.

1077
01:03:01.031 --> 01:03:02.157
(Jiuming) We need a distraction.

1078
01:03:03.492 --> 01:03:06.203
Light up the station.
The megs will attack it.

1079
01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:07.663
Yeah. And kill us.

1080
01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:09.873
Not if we're fast enough.

1081
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:11.166
Jiuming!

1082
01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.884
-Hey, Rigas.
-Yep?

1083
01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.678
For a moment, I thought you
were gonna kill me back there.

1084
01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:25.472
Well, she did say
to shoot you in the heart.

1085
01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:27.599
And I know for a fact
you ain't got one of those.

1086
01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:29.017
(laughing)

1087
01:03:32.104 --> 01:03:33.063
(in Mandarin)

1088
01:03:33.146 --> 01:03:34.398
Thank you for working.

1089
01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:40.112
(dramatic music playing)

1090
01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:46.285
-(grunts)
-(electricity crackling)

1091
01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:48.245
(Rigas groaning)

1092
01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.788
Gotta close the hatch, Jonas.

1093
01:03:49.872 --> 01:03:50.747
(all gasps)

1094
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.169
We're all gonna die.

1095
01:03:56.879 --> 01:03:58.922
-He's gonna make it.
-No, he's not.

1096
01:04:02.217 --> 01:04:04.887
-He's gonna make it.
-No! We have to close the hatch!

1097
01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:06.930
(grunting)

1098
01:04:10.267 --> 01:04:11.768
(Rigas) Close it! Jonas!

1099
01:04:20.694 --> 01:04:21.570
I'm here!

1100
01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:24.072
That's him!

1101
01:04:24.156 --> 01:04:25.616
(grunts)

1102
01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:37.711
That was close.

1103
01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:39.338
(breathing heavily)

1104
01:04:39.463 --> 01:04:40.380
Too close.

1105
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:44.468
You should have shut the hatch.

1106
01:04:45.385 --> 01:04:47.054
Yeah. Meiying would have killed me.

1107
01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:52.351
You thought about it, though.

1108
01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:54.353
Yeah. We thought about it.

1109
01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:56.230
Didn't we, Rigas?

1110
01:04:56.313 --> 01:04:58.106
(panting) Shut up.

1111
01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:00.400
Just a little bit.

1112
01:05:01.193 --> 01:05:02.027
(in Mandarin)

1113
01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:02.945
Very funny.

1114
01:05:06.657 --> 01:05:08.033
(rumbling)

1115
01:05:10.953 --> 01:05:12.204
(Jiuming) Explosives?

1116
01:05:13.956 --> 01:05:14.873
Check this out.

1117
01:05:14.957 --> 01:05:15.999
Look what else.

1118
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:30.722
(Meiying) Is that gonna be a problem?

1119
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.517
(Jiuming) It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

1120
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.728
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

1121
01:05:36.812 --> 01:05:38.146
It will seal up eventually.

1122
01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:40.566
Eventually?

1123
01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.026
Yeah. Within an hour.

1124
01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:45.153
(Meiying) Can the megs
follow us through?

1125
01:05:46.071 --> 01:05:47.155
(Jiuming) I hope not.

1126
01:05:51.118 --> 01:05:52.995
(rattling)

1127
01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:58.375
(footsteps)

1128
01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:06.884
(breathing heavily)

1129
01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:15.642
Boys, I don't want to harm you, but I do
need you to come out of this room.

1130
01:06:15.726 --> 01:06:17.811
(whispers) It's Jess.
She's got three soldiers.

1131
01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.647
(DJ) Yeah. It's go time.

1132
01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:22.733
Take this.

1133
01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:24.193
-The hell is this?
-It's a Taser.

1134
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:25.986
Open up.

1135
01:06:26.778 --> 01:06:28.780
They tried to kill Jonas,
they're definitely gonna kill us.

1136
01:06:28.906 --> 01:06:30.449
(whispers) Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

1137
01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:31.491
On the count of three,

1138
01:06:31.617 --> 01:06:33.493
you'll open the door
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

1139
01:06:33.577 --> 01:06:35.412
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

1140
01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:37.247
Then go out there and use the Taser.

1141
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:38.707
One, two, three.

1142
01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:42.085
(all groaning)

1143
01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:42.961
(DJ) No, Mac, no!

1144
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.505
-No, Mac!
-(Mac groaning)

1145
01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:47.007
(Mac) It burns! It burns!

1146
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.842
(groaning) I'm sorry!

1147
01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:50.344
-(groaning)
-(DJ) Sleepy time.

1148
01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:06.485
What's that?

1149
01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:10.614
Trouble.

1150
01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:23.001
So, we're walking fast and with a lot
of determination, which is great.

1151
01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:25.170
But what exactly is the plan here?

1152
01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:26.338
They're armed and we're not.

1153
01:07:32.177 --> 01:07:33.470
(Meiying) All righty.
So what are you thinking?

1154
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:35.764
(Jonas) What are you thinking?

1155
01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:38.392
You and I find Mac and DJ.

1156
01:07:38.475 --> 01:07:39.768
Rigas, grab what you can.

1157
01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:41.311
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

1158
01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:42.771
Rock and roll.

1159
01:07:42.855 --> 01:07:44.398
Safest if Meiying goes with you.

1160
01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:46.441
(indistinct radio chatter)

1161
01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:54.116
I'll protect her with my life.

1162
01:07:55.075 --> 01:07:56.076
And I'll protect her with mine.

1163
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:57.744
No.

1164
01:07:57.828 --> 01:07:58.954
No.

1165
01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:00.122
No.

1166
01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:02.416
Let's go.

1167
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.889
(DJ) I told you to wait
before you went out that door.

1168
01:08:16.972 --> 01:08:18.807
-How's your eyes?
-My eye stings.

1169
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:21.810
(groans) If we climb up
to the communications array,

1170
01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:24.104
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

1171
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:25.314
What are we supposed to say?

1172
01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:27.649
Um... Terrorist action?

1173
01:08:27.733 --> 01:08:29.276
-Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
-Yeah, terrorist action.

1174
01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.486
-Okay.
-You got a better idea?

1175
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:32.571
(man) Freeze!

1176
01:08:32.654 --> 01:08:34.156
-(Mac groans)
-Oh, no.

1177
01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:45.542
DJ! DJ!

1178
01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:48.629
What the hell?

1179
01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:51.840
-Wow! Yeah, baby! Get some!
-(gun firing)

1180
01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:53.050
-(Mac) Hey.
-Run, Mac, run!

1181
01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:55.385
Go, go, go!

1182
01:08:56.386 --> 01:08:58.347
(DJ grunting)

1183
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.724
(Mac screaming)

1184
01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:09.733
(man) Spread out! Find 'em.

1185
01:09:13.195 --> 01:09:16.031
(Mac) You got Tasers? Now you can swim?

1186
01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:18.116
All of a sudden you're running around
like you're Batman.

1187
01:09:19.034 --> 01:09:19.993
Hell yeah.

1188
01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:21.203
(panting)

1189
01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:24.665
After last time,
y'all begged me to come back.

1190
01:09:24.748 --> 01:09:27.793
-"DJ, Oh! We family, DJ."
-(gunfire continues)

1191
01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:30.671
"DJ, we need you." Yeah, all right. Bet.

1192
01:09:30.754 --> 01:09:31.672
But I ain't stupid.

1193
01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:34.466
I trained up, I learned how to fight,
I learned how to swim,

1194
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.052
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

1195
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:38.595
-Survival pack?
-Yeah.

1196
01:09:38.679 --> 01:09:39.680
Check this out.

1197
01:09:40.597 --> 01:09:42.015
Come here, baby. Come here.

1198
01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:43.058
Bam.

1199
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:47.312
Yeah, I even made poison-tipped bullets

1200
01:09:47.396 --> 01:09:48.730
just like Jaws 2.

1201
01:09:53.235 --> 01:09:54.695
Come on, DJ! Let's go, let's go.

1202
01:09:58.448 --> 01:09:59.491
This is insane.

1203
01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:04.580
(man 1) Freeze, assholes.

1204
01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.834
(man 2) Yeah, freeze.

1205
01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:09.877
You got this?

1206
01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:15.424
(DJ) That was some unfortunate shit
back there.

1207
01:10:16.592 --> 01:10:18.302
(Jiuming) No, please! Don't shoot!

1208
01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:19.386
(panting)

1209
01:10:20.846 --> 01:10:21.763
(in Mandarin)

1210
01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:22.764
I know you're looking for me and Jonas.

1211
01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:24.391
I also know you don't speak Chinese,

1212
01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:27.352
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

1213
01:10:27.436 --> 01:10:29.146
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

1214
01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:30.814
(DJ) What?

1215
01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:38.280
(yelling) Sucker.

1216
01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:43.118
(laughing) I thought you were dead.

1217
01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:45.579
Wishful thinking, Mac.

1218
01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:48.165
(DJ) If it ain't the deviated septum.

1219
01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:49.625
-Boat's leaving.
-(DJ) Huh.

1220
01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:54.922
(Jess) What's our status?

1221
01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:57.174
(man) Bravo team are inbound.
ETA, 10 minutes.

1222
01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:58.217
Excellent.

1223
01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:01.637
What are you doing here?

1224
01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:10.771
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1225
01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.357
Jonas is on Mana One.

1226
01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:16.276
We need to lock this place down now.

1227
01:11:19.196 --> 01:11:21.031
Search the station top to bottom.

1228
01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:24.284
Secure personnel in their quarters,
kill anyone else.

1229
01:11:24.368 --> 01:11:26.537
Go! Go!

1230
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:34.711
Oh, my God.

1231
01:11:40.884 --> 01:11:42.344
Guys?

1232
01:11:42.427 --> 01:11:44.429
We've got a big problem.

1233
01:11:53.146 --> 01:11:54.439
(Jess) We tracked three megs
that escaped

1234
01:11:54.523 --> 01:11:55.399
before the breach closed.

1235
01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:58.235
We're gonna need
a good cover story for this.

1236
01:11:58.318 --> 01:11:59.278
Well, that shouldn't be hard.

1237
01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:01.947
Everyone knows Jonas and Jiuming
were reckless.

1238
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.199
No, we need a hero.

1239
01:12:04.283 --> 01:12:08.120
Someone to emerge
from this unforeseeable tragedy...

1240
01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:11.331
who can step into a leadership position
at the Institute.

1241
01:12:11.415 --> 01:12:14.710
Jess, are you ready for promotion?

1242
01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.754
(chuckles) I appreciate your confidence.

1243
01:12:17.838 --> 01:12:19.047
-Jess!
-(alarm blaring)

1244
01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:22.259
It's from the thermocline breach.
But you can relax. This place?

1245
01:12:23.093 --> 01:12:24.011
Meg-proof.

1246
01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:26.471
I mean, Jonas was always afraid of this,
but I think

1247
01:12:26.597 --> 01:12:28.515
between trackers and gunships,
we can solve the problem

1248
01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:31.602
and come out the other side
with a significant positive PR spin.

1249
01:12:32.477 --> 01:12:33.353
Yeah, I'm on it.

1250
01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:34.438
I was also thinking--

1251
01:12:39.026 --> 01:12:40.444
(groaning)

1252
01:12:40.527 --> 01:12:41.820
(heavy thud)

1253
01:12:43.113 --> 01:12:45.240
-(Meiying yelps)
-(Rigas grunts)

1254
01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:47.367
(Montes yelling)

1255
01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:57.085
(screaming)

1256
01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:01.798
What now?

1257
01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.051
It's our only way off. We have to take it.

1258
01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:06.678
But that thing doesn't have the range
to get us to the mainland.

1259
01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:11.016
You're worried about the destination?
What about the first hundred yards?

1260
01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:12.184
That's where we're gonna die.

1261
01:13:12.893 --> 01:13:14.228
We paddle out slow.

1262
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:16.605
No engines. Minimal motion.

1263
01:13:16.688 --> 01:13:18.106
We won't look like food.

1264
01:13:18.232 --> 01:13:20.442
When we're clear,
we make a run for it. Huh?

1265
01:13:20.526 --> 01:13:21.401
Let's do it.

1266
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.322
(DJ) I still think we look like food.

1267
01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:29.326
(Jiuming) Shh. Quiet, everyone.
Paddle slowly.

1268
01:13:29.409 --> 01:13:31.954
This feels unpleasantly familiar.

1269
01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:34.164
Let's just hope it goes better
than last time.

1270
01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:36.083
What happened last time?

1271
01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:38.252
You don't wanna know.

1272
01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:40.295
(uneasy music playing)

1273
01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:45.551
(Jiuming) Oh. Here he comes.

1274
01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:47.219
(tense music playing)

1275
01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:53.433
(commander) Go, go, go!

1276
01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:56.645
Let's not bring 'em back alive.

1277
01:13:57.479 --> 01:13:58.522
(engine starts)

1278
01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:00.566
You do know how
to drive this thing, right?

1279
01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.825
Stop! Stop the engine right now.

1280
01:14:11.451 --> 01:14:12.911
Or you will attract the megs.

1281
01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.124
Okay. Be still.

1282
01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.626
-No motion whatsoever.
-(engine stops)

1283
01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.133
I have the shot.

1284
01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:28.510
Take it.

1285
01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:29.803
-Get down!
-(mercenary) Come on, mate, do your job.

1286
01:14:29.887 --> 01:14:31.471
-Take the bloody shot.
-It's not easy as it looks.

1287
01:14:31.555 --> 01:14:32.848
(mercenaries screaming)

1288
01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:39.313
(DJ) He got 'em! He ate 'em!
He ate the whole boat!

1289
01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:43.609
What happened?

1290
01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:45.527
(Montes on phone) Jess is dead.

1291
01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:48.155
-What?
-We stabilized Mana One,

1292
01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:50.407
but Taylor and Zhang have escaped.

1293
01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.825
What do you want me to do?

1294
01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:53.410
(Driscoll) Fix it! Kill them!

1295
01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:55.537
You do this, you write your own ticket.

1296
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.955
You are set for life.

1297
01:14:57.706 --> 01:14:58.790
Okay.

1298
01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:02.669
There's only a couple places
they could make it to.

1299
01:15:02.753 --> 01:15:04.838
-Are you crying, Montes?
-(line disconnects)

1300
01:15:09.843 --> 01:15:10.761
(canister hisses)

1301
01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.477
Any sign of the megs?

1302
01:15:19.436 --> 01:15:20.395
Negative.

1303
01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:23.065
There's no way this thing's gonna work.

1304
01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:24.900
It's gonna work.

1305
01:15:25.817 --> 01:15:28.612
Look, you got more chance of blowing up
yourself than one of the megs.

1306
01:15:29.613 --> 01:15:31.156
At least I won't get eaten.

1307
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.824
Ha! I hear that.

1308
01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:33.992
(Mac) Jo...

1309
01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:35.118
can you make me one?

1310
01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.455
I got you covered, Mac.

1311
01:15:38.539 --> 01:15:40.832
We have to find a way to warn people.

1312
01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:44.086
In case the megs move towards land.
There's an island

1313
01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.463
60 klicks southeast of us.

1314
01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:49.132
It's listed as inhabited.

1315
01:15:49.216 --> 01:15:50.926
Inhabited by who?

1316
01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:53.095
The name more or less translates to...

1317
01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.222
Fun Island.

1318
01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:57.516
Fun Island?

1319
01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:03.146
-(upbeat Mandarin song plays)
-(people cheering)

1320
01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:04.314
(all) Yeah!

1321
01:16:04.398 --> 01:16:05.691
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

1322
01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:13.198
(host) Welcome to Fun Island.
Our resort has everything.

1323
01:16:14.283 --> 01:16:16.743
The restaurant, amazing.

1324
01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.537
The disco, incredible.

1325
01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:20.873
And our spa, to die for.

1326
01:16:20.956 --> 01:16:21.790
(man) Oh.

1327
01:16:21.874 --> 01:16:22.875
(host) OMG.

1328
01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:25.294
It's our special dish.
Seafood Surprise!

1329
01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:27.921
Wow, I wouldn't know where to start.

1330
01:16:28.046 --> 01:16:29.923
Well, just don't miss out
on the grilled shark.

1331
01:16:30.007 --> 01:16:32.050
-(dog whines)
-Pippin! Pippin! Pippin!

1332
01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:34.469
-Whoa! What is that?
-Pippin!

1333
01:16:34.595 --> 01:16:36.430
(tourist) What are they running from?

1334
01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.435
(businessman)
Your first time at the rodeo?

1335
01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.477
(barking)

1336
01:16:42.603 --> 01:16:45.105
I worked with your dad since
before you were born.

1337
01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:46.857
I never had this kind of trouble
from him.

1338
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:47.733
(in Mandarin)

1339
01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:49.151
Can you put your phone down?

1340
01:16:49.234 --> 01:16:51.445
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation,

1341
01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:52.946
savor the moment.

1342
01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:55.657
(Businessman) Yeah,
and I yelled at him too.

1343
01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:57.034
(in Mandarin)

1344
01:16:57.117 --> 01:16:59.203
I've already got 400 likes.

1345
01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:03.874
(in English) I'm sitting in paradise
and you are ruining it!

1346
01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:07.044
Who does that?
Who ruins paradise for other people?

1347
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.632
Hey, baby.

1348
01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:13.300
Wanna rub some oil on my back?

1349
01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:15.260
No?

1350
01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:17.137
How 'bout my front? (chuckles)

1351
01:17:17.846 --> 01:17:18.680
Ew.

1352
01:17:18.847 --> 01:17:24.144
(romantic music playing)

1353
01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:25.354
(in Mandarin)

1354
01:17:25.437 --> 01:17:26.605
Come over.

1355
01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:27.523
What?

1356
01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:32.069
What are you doing?

1357
01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:35.113
(speaking Mandarin)

1358
01:17:35.197 --> 01:17:37.032
(indistinct chatter)

1359
01:17:38.742 --> 01:17:39.826
Yaoyao...

1360
01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:43.747
Will you marry me?

1361
01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:50.546
Find it, idiot!

1362
01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:52.047
Wait!

1363
01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:55.092
Have you found it?

1364
01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:58.595
-(squelching)
-(water splashing)

1365
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:00.889
Hey.

1366
01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.518
Yaoyao.

1367
01:18:06.687 --> 01:18:07.646
Yaoyao.

1368
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:09.648
Yaoyao!

1369
01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:11.149
-Yaoyao!
-(boat thuds)

1370
01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:12.484
(people screaming)

1371
01:18:13.777 --> 01:18:17.072
(ominous music playing)

1372
01:18:20.117 --> 01:18:23.245
(people grunting, gasping)

1373
01:18:23.328 --> 01:18:24.496
(woman shrieking)

1374
01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:26.456
(yelps)

1375
01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:28.750
(woman shrieks)

1376
01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:44.975
This doesn't look good.

1377
01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:47.144
Rigas, get us there fast!

1378
01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:49.229
(engine revving)

1379
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:56.528
Kill the cellphone uplink.

1380
01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:09.875
(Driscoll) There's a lot of exposure
for us on this.

1381
01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:13.670
Take care of Jonas and his team
quickly and quietly.

1382
01:19:16.215 --> 01:19:17.716
(Jonas) Everybody out of the water!

1383
01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:20.135
-(Mac) Shark! Shark!
-(Jonas) Get back on the beach!

1384
01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:22.638
-Get out of the water!
-(Jiuming speaking Mandarin)

1385
01:19:22.721 --> 01:19:23.931
Get back on the beach!

1386
01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:26.975
(laughing)

1387
01:19:27.059 --> 01:19:28.894
(man over radio) Mobile comms
are down, over.

1388
01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:32.731
(Meg screeching in distance)

1389
01:19:33.524 --> 01:19:34.858
(distant gunshots)

1390
01:19:38.278 --> 01:19:40.197
(speaking Spanish)

1391
01:19:46.245 --> 01:19:49.289
(foreboding music playing)

1392
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:55.629
(creature calling)

1393
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:06.348
(screams)

1394
01:20:08.308 --> 01:20:10.352
-(gunshots)
-(man screaming)

1395
01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:11.603
(both grunting)

1396
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:14.064
-(shrieks)
-(creature snarls)

1397
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:15.274
(in English) You copy, guys?

1398
01:20:15.357 --> 01:20:16.859
(snarling)

1399
01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:19.278
-(mercenary) Crocodile!
-(mercenaries clamoring)

1400
01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:20.779
What is that?

1401
01:20:20.904 --> 01:20:22.281
-Move, move!
-Get into the chopper.

1402
01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:24.116
-Now! Go with her!
-(gunshots)

1403
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.703
(roaring)

1404
01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:30.330
Mmm. Mmm.

1405
01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.915
(indistinct chatter)

1406
01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:34.376
-(gunshots)
-(creature snarling)

1407
01:20:34.459 --> 01:20:37.212
(people clamoring, screaming)

1408
01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:41.091
(Jonas) Everybody out!

1409
01:20:41.175 --> 01:20:42.426
-(Mac) Shark!
-(Jiuming) Shark!

1410
01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:44.011
(shouting in Mandarin)

1411
01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:45.053
Go back! Don't go into the water!

1412
01:20:45.137 --> 01:20:46.346
There's a shark!

1413
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:48.140
(Jonas) Get on the beach!

1414
01:20:48.223 --> 01:20:49.349
Go back!

1415
01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:50.934
We have to save them.

1416
01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:52.477
-I'm not leaving ya.
-Cell phone's down.

1417
01:20:53.187 --> 01:20:54.521
Hello? Hello?

1418
01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:55.731
-No signal.
-There's no choice.

1419
01:20:55.814 --> 01:20:57.232
-She's right.
-We got no signal, guys.

1420
01:20:57.316 --> 01:20:59.776
Hey, you two!
Find a way to call for help.

1421
01:20:59.902 --> 01:21:00.861
Let everyone know what happened.

1422
01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:02.237
Come on, come on! This way, this way!

1423
01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:04.948
You're gonna hide.

1424
01:21:05.032 --> 01:21:06.033
See that lifeguard tower?

1425
01:21:06.116 --> 01:21:07.951
-Yeah.
-You go there and you stay there.

1426
01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:10.495
This is not one of those things
where I tell you to do something,

1427
01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:13.165
you say "yes,"
and then you do whatever you want.

1428
01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:14.583
Understand?

1429
01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:15.667
Yes.

1430
01:21:16.335 --> 01:21:18.420
-You're not messing with me?
-No.

1431
01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:21.131
I can't do what I need to do
if I'm worried about you.

1432
01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.091
I'll be fine.

1433
01:21:23.759 --> 01:21:25.093
Promise me you'll come back.

1434
01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:30.057
You know I love you.

1435
01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:41.735
(boat pedals squeaking)

1436
01:21:47.366 --> 01:21:48.367
(screaming)

1437
01:21:52.871 --> 01:21:54.373
(screaming)

1438
01:21:56.834 --> 01:21:58.710
(people screaming)

1439
01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:10.681
Oh, shit.

1440
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:14.643
(distant gunshots)

1441
01:22:15.602 --> 01:22:16.520
Sonny.

1442
01:22:16.603 --> 01:22:17.813
Check that out.

1443
01:22:17.896 --> 01:22:19.189
(helicopter powers down)

1444
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.319
Hey, yo, my man. You got a phone?

1445
01:22:24.403 --> 01:22:25.863
(people screaming)

1446
01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:27.197
What's everyone running from?

1447
01:22:27.281 --> 01:22:28.532
(creature snarls)

1448
01:22:28.615 --> 01:22:30.117
What the hell was that?

1449
01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:33.078
(Jonas) Three megs. Three of us.

1450
01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:34.663
We each grab a jet ski.

1451
01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:36.999
Get them to chase it
away from these people and out to sea.

1452
01:22:37.916 --> 01:22:39.084
Then we harpoon them.

1453
01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:41.086
Oh, you mean with those jerry-rigged,

1454
01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:43.380
maybe they work,
maybe they kill us harpoons?

1455
01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:44.256
Yeah.

1456
01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:45.299
It's a terrible idea.

1457
01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:48.427
You got a better one? No? No.

1458
01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:50.012
-Then we're agreed.
-Yeah.

1459
01:22:50.095 --> 01:22:51.221
-Good.
-Great.

1460
01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:53.348
(gunshots)

1461
01:22:53.432 --> 01:22:55.184
(creature roars)

1462
01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:05.194
(creature growling)

1463
01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:07.654
Montes!

1464
01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:10.699
Shit.

1465
01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:17.456
(sighs)

1466
01:23:17.581 --> 01:23:19.082
(creature snarls)

1467
01:23:28.717 --> 01:23:30.552
(screaming)

1468
01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:35.766
(screaming)

1469
01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:40.229
(DJ) Let's go old school.

1470
01:23:46.652 --> 01:23:48.487
The landline's down, too.

1471
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.280
Okay, coast is clear. Let's go.

1472
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:57.746
They can walk?

1473
01:23:58.664 --> 01:23:59.790
(roars)

1474
01:23:59.873 --> 01:24:00.707
Shit.

1475
01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:03.252
It's those things.

1476
01:24:03.335 --> 01:24:05.504
They haven't spotted us yet.

1477
01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:06.630
Okay.

1478
01:24:12.678 --> 01:24:13.637
What else you got in here?

1479
01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:15.639
Emergency stuff.

1480
01:24:15.764 --> 01:24:16.807
(unzips bag)

1481
01:24:16.890 --> 01:24:18.392
(people screaming in distance)

1482
01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:19.434
Okay.

1483
01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:24.523
Really? Condoms?

1484
01:24:25.274 --> 01:24:26.525
Different kind of emergencies.

1485
01:24:27.234 --> 01:24:28.151
Hand me that.

1486
01:24:31.864 --> 01:24:33.323
Now hand me that gum in your mouth.

1487
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.244
Thank you.

1488
01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:43.375
(snarling)

1489
01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:44.585
(people screaming)

1490
01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:50.757
There's only one ski.

1491
01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:52.426
Give me your harpoons.

1492
01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:55.304
You sure?

1493
01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:56.346
Oh...

1494
01:25:00.517 --> 01:25:01.935
-I got this.
-(Mac) Good luck.

1495
01:25:03.437 --> 01:25:04.646
We need more firepower.

1496
01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:06.148
Yeah.

1497
01:25:07.816 --> 01:25:09.651
I have an idea. Let's go.

1498
01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:20.954
Not this time, Taylor.

1499
01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:23.832
(speaking Spanish)

1500
01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:44.019
(Jiuming whispers)
This should be the place.

1501
01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.023
Come on.

1502
01:25:54.446 --> 01:25:55.572
What are we looking for?

1503
01:25:57.324 --> 01:25:58.700
Ammonium nitrate.

1504
01:26:00.202 --> 01:26:01.578
You're making a bomb?

1505
01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:04.039
This stuff is as powerful as TNT.

1506
01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.249
-(mercenary) Hey!
-(creature snarls)

1507
01:26:05.332 --> 01:26:07.793
-(gunshots)
-Get in! Get in!

1508
01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:09.878
-(all clamoring)
-(gunshot)

1509
01:26:12.589 --> 01:26:13.674
Freeze!

1510
01:26:13.757 --> 01:26:15.759
(dramatic music playing)

1511
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:32.401
Come on!

1512
01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:53.088
(engine sputtering)

1513
01:27:04.308 --> 01:27:05.267
Come on!

1514
01:27:18.197 --> 01:27:19.865
(DJ) Come on, let's see
if he's got a phone.

1515
01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:20.991
(creature snarls)

1516
01:27:23.327 --> 01:27:25.245
I got the sat phone. I got the sat...

1517
01:27:25.329 --> 01:27:26.914
I got the phone,
why you stealing his money?

1518
01:27:26.997 --> 01:27:28.498
-What? He's not gonna need it.
-(snarling)

1519
01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:29.416
Uh-oh.

1520
01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:33.921
Nice doggies. Nice doggies.

1521
01:27:34.004 --> 01:27:34.922
Okay, Rigas.

1522
01:27:35.005 --> 01:27:37.049
On the count of three, we're gonna bolt.

1523
01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:39.551
One. Two. Three!

1524
01:27:39.635 --> 01:27:40.427
What the hell? Hey!

1525
01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:44.348
Wait for DJ! Wait for DJ!

1526
01:27:47.017 --> 01:27:50.145
-They're right behind us!
-Let's hide in here!

1527
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:52.314
Come on, come on. Come here, come here.

1528
01:27:52.397 --> 01:27:54.525
-What the hell?
-Hi, DJ. Hi, Rigas.

1529
01:27:54.608 --> 01:27:56.902
All of you together.
Up against the wall. Hands up!

1530
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.697
I wouldn't point that at me
if I were you. Trust me.

1531
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:03.200
Shut it! Keep your hands in the air.

1532
01:28:03.283 --> 01:28:04.159
Hands up!

1533
01:28:08.247 --> 01:28:09.248
Don't want to hurt you...

1534
01:28:10.165 --> 01:28:11.750
so I'm going to give you one chance.

1535
01:28:12.668 --> 01:28:14.336
Put those weapons down.

1536
01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:15.546
Or you'll do what?

1537
01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:18.674
Stay still, little guy.

1538
01:28:19.758 --> 01:28:21.093
(groans)

1539
01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:22.177
(gate opening)

1540
01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:25.931
(mercenary 1) No, no! Joe, Joe, door!

1541
01:28:26.014 --> 01:28:27.474
Stay where you are!

1542
01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:28.976
(mercenaries clamoring)

1543
01:28:29.059 --> 01:28:30.727
-Go, go!
-(mercenary 2) Get to cover!

1544
01:28:30.811 --> 01:28:32.020
(gunshots)

1545
01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:35.566
(all screaming)

1546
01:28:35.649 --> 01:28:37.734
-(mercenaries screaming)
-(gunshots)

1547
01:28:44.408 --> 01:28:46.159
(grunting)

1548
01:28:48.871 --> 01:28:49.830
Damn!

1549
01:28:49.913 --> 01:28:51.039
(phone beeps)

1550
01:28:53.292 --> 01:28:54.293
I got signal.

1551
01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:55.627
Call for help!

1552
01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:57.337
To get down to the beach and help people!

1553
01:28:58.005 --> 01:28:59.006
(Mac) Where are you going?

1554
01:28:59.089 --> 01:29:01.300
-Stealing a chopper.
-(Mac) What chopper?

1555
01:29:01.383 --> 01:29:02.551
Global rescue?

1556
01:29:02.634 --> 01:29:05.554
We need rescue!
We need you to send everybody you got!

1557
01:29:05.637 --> 01:29:08.724
The National Guard, the lifeguard,
the Coast Guard, anybody!

1558
01:29:08.807 --> 01:29:10.017
Just come now!

1559
01:29:10.142 --> 01:29:11.560
(tense music playing)

1560
01:29:31.955 --> 01:29:33.248
(explosion)

1561
01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.750
(engine stops)

1562
01:30:16.834 --> 01:30:18.919
(Mac) Ugh! Looks like someone else
had the same idea.

1563
01:30:19.044 --> 01:30:19.920
(creature snarling)

1564
01:30:20.003 --> 01:30:21.713
We need a plan.

1565
01:30:21.797 --> 01:30:24.258
We have to lead it away
and steal the chopper.

1566
01:30:24.383 --> 01:30:26.885
Okay, you lead it away,
I'll steal the chopper.

1567
01:30:27.678 --> 01:30:29.972
-You distract it, I'll get the chopper.
-Why me?

1568
01:30:30.055 --> 01:30:31.348
Can you fly a chopper?

1569
01:30:31.431 --> 01:30:32.349
Yeah, I can.

1570
01:30:32.432 --> 01:30:33.725
-You have a license?
-Yes, I do!

1571
01:30:33.809 --> 01:30:35.143
-I didn't know that.
-What?

1572
01:30:35.227 --> 01:30:36.478
Okay, good plan.

1573
01:30:36.562 --> 01:30:37.729
(whispers) Mac!

1574
01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:43.235
(clanging)

1575
01:30:43.318 --> 01:30:44.403
(snarling)

1576
01:30:45.821 --> 01:30:46.947
(clanging)

1577
01:30:50.784 --> 01:30:52.619
(snarling)

1578
01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:55.747
(gasps)

1579
01:30:59.543 --> 01:31:01.837
-(gasps, grunting)
-(snarls)

1580
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:13.765
(squealing)

1581
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:17.269
Jiuming! We gotta go!

1582
01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:19.229
-(snarling)
-(footsteps approaching)

1583
01:31:19.313 --> 01:31:20.564
(shrieks)

1584
01:31:24.443 --> 01:31:26.236
Fuel! Get the fuel!

1585
01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.321
Gas! We need gas!

1586
01:31:34.578 --> 01:31:36.079
-Get up!
-(helicopter powering up)

1587
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:39.666
(grunts)

1588
01:31:41.335 --> 01:31:42.294
(Mac) Get the fuel!

1589
01:31:47.049 --> 01:31:49.593
-(chitters)
-Lizard incoming!

1590
01:31:49.676 --> 01:31:50.511
Hold on!

1591
01:31:51.386 --> 01:31:52.971
Jiuming? Jiuming!

1592
01:32:04.107 --> 01:32:04.942
Run!

1593
01:32:11.865 --> 01:32:12.699
Go!

1594
01:32:15.744 --> 01:32:16.995
(grunts)

1595
01:32:17.079 --> 01:32:18.080
(Mac) Whoa, yay!

1596
01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:21.542
Man, I didn't think you were
gonna make that one.

1597
01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:23.836
(barking)

1598
01:32:23.919 --> 01:32:25.462
(people gasping)

1599
01:32:30.551 --> 01:32:31.385
(screaming)

1600
01:32:31.468 --> 01:32:32.386
Run!

1601
01:32:41.937 --> 01:32:44.648
(people screaming in distance)

1602
01:32:46.191 --> 01:32:47.359
(breath trembling) No.

1603
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.293
(gunshots)

1604
01:33:14.553 --> 01:33:15.846
(Montes) Where are you going, Jonas?

1605
01:33:17.014 --> 01:33:18.807
(gunshots)

1606
01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:26.231
(laughing)

1607
01:33:50.881 --> 01:33:53.759
(people screaming)

1608
01:33:53.884 --> 01:33:56.595
(barking, snarling)

1609
01:33:57.513 --> 01:33:59.223
Get lower! That's Meiying!

1610
01:33:59.306 --> 01:34:00.474
(Mac) Are you sure it's Meiying?

1611
01:34:06.563 --> 01:34:07.481
Get lower!

1612
01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:09.316
(Mac) Okay, okay! Hold on!

1613
01:34:10.943 --> 01:34:12.027
(people clamoring)

1614
01:34:20.994 --> 01:34:22.454
(people screaming)

1615
01:34:24.957 --> 01:34:26.041
Meiying!

1616
01:34:27.835 --> 01:34:28.836
Over here!

1617
01:34:31.964 --> 01:34:32.881
(Jiuming) Leap up!

1618
01:34:45.394 --> 01:34:47.187
-(grunting)
-(alarm blaring)

1619
01:34:52.359 --> 01:34:53.569
(yelling)

1620
01:34:57.322 --> 01:34:58.574
(groans, gasps)

1621
01:34:59.283 --> 01:35:00.701
(bomb beeping)

1622
01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:02.995
-(beeping stops)
-(water splashing)

1623
01:35:14.548 --> 01:35:16.550
(tense music playing)

1624
01:35:19.678 --> 01:35:21.138
(Jonas grunts)

1625
01:35:45.704 --> 01:35:46.788
(grunts)

1626
01:35:51.376 --> 01:35:52.628
(yelling)

1627
01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:57.299
(Montes) Jonas is still alive?

1628
01:35:57.382 --> 01:35:59.051
Get me over there!

1629
01:35:59.134 --> 01:36:00.886
(people screaming)

1630
01:36:05.307 --> 01:36:06.058
Help!

1631
01:36:06.892 --> 01:36:08.352
(in Mandarin) Hang on, Meiying!

1632
01:36:12.231 --> 01:36:13.565
(grunts loudly)

1633
01:36:24.117 --> 01:36:25.911
Taylor!

1634
01:36:29.623 --> 01:36:30.999
Come on!

1635
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:36.338
Come out from under the bridge,
little troll!

1636
01:36:38.674 --> 01:36:40.259
(speaking Spanish)

1637
01:36:45.514 --> 01:36:46.849
(screaming)

1638
01:36:49.476 --> 01:36:50.561
(both grunting)

1639
01:37:00.362 --> 01:37:01.780
(in English) End of the line, no?

1640
01:37:01.905 --> 01:37:03.240
I guess it is.

1641
01:37:04.366 --> 01:37:05.284
You got the gun.

1642
01:37:10.789 --> 01:37:11.707
I won't be needing this.

1643
01:37:13.292 --> 01:37:14.835
(chuckling)

1644
01:37:14.918 --> 01:37:16.295
I knew you couldn't do it.

1645
01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:18.297
(grunts)

1646
01:37:20.299 --> 01:37:21.717
See you later, chum.

1647
01:37:26.638 --> 01:37:27.931
(Meiying) Jiu!

1648
01:37:28.015 --> 01:37:29.308
(grunting)

1649
01:37:30.225 --> 01:37:31.059
Meiying!

1650
01:37:31.185 --> 01:37:32.269
(in Mandarin)

1651
01:37:32.352 --> 01:37:33.395
Throw me the bomb!

1652
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.396
(in English) Where?

1653
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:37.399
(in Mandarin) Catch it!

1654
01:37:37.482 --> 01:37:38.692
(grunting)

1655
01:37:49.077 --> 01:37:50.579
(growls)

1656
01:38:06.762 --> 01:38:07.930
(creature groans)

1657
01:38:10.599 --> 01:38:12.643
(beeping)

1658
01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:14.019
(rapid beeping)

1659
01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:15.395
(explosion)

1660
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:22.069
(creature screeches)

1661
01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:23.362
(grunts)

1662
01:38:29.284 --> 01:38:30.410
(gasping)

1663
01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.284
(in English) Hold on! I'm coming!

1664
01:39:14.413 --> 01:39:15.497
(Jonas) Meiying!

1665
01:39:17.082 --> 01:39:18.208
Meiying!

1666
01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:19.960
Jonas! Over here!

1667
01:39:21.128 --> 01:39:22.546
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1668
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:24.131
Uncle Jiuming and Mac's in trouble.

1669
01:39:29.386 --> 01:39:30.888
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1670
01:39:39.897 --> 01:39:42.524
-Mac! Are you okay? Mac?
-(grunting)

1671
01:40:01.752 --> 01:40:03.712
(tense music playing)

1672
01:40:19.937 --> 01:40:23.190
-(metal thuds)
-(breathing heavily, grunts)

1673
01:40:34.076 --> 01:40:35.035
(yells)

1674
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:41.250
Come on, you ugly bastard!

1675
01:40:49.258 --> 01:40:50.592
(screams)

1676
01:40:50.676 --> 01:40:53.053
-(metal creaking)
-(grunting)

1677
01:41:01.186 --> 01:41:03.063
(yelling)

1678
01:41:08.694 --> 01:41:09.528
(Jiuming grunts)

1679
01:41:29.256 --> 01:41:30.382
(people clamoring)

1680
01:41:38.682 --> 01:41:39.933
Come on, come on, come on!

1681
01:41:40.017 --> 01:41:41.810
Come on, come on. I got you, I got you.
Come on, come on!

1682
01:41:43.812 --> 01:41:45.439
Come on, come on, come on!

1683
01:41:48.192 --> 01:41:50.110
Meiying, what are you doing here?

1684
01:41:50.194 --> 01:41:51.320
I had to save the dog!

1685
01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:52.946
What?

1686
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:54.573
-(creature snarls)
-(host) Mommy's here.

1687
01:41:54.656 --> 01:41:56.366
-Thank you, thank you, thank you!
-You're welcome.

1688
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:58.994
-(creature snarls)
-(gunshots)

1689
01:41:59.077 --> 01:42:01.830
-(people gasping)
-(roaring)

1690
01:42:01.914 --> 01:42:03.749
-Oh, no, you don't!
-(Rigas) Meiying! Come!

1691
01:42:05.667 --> 01:42:06.835
(Meiying yelps)

1692
01:42:13.008 --> 01:42:13.842
(DJ) Hell yeah!

1693
01:42:13.926 --> 01:42:15.886
Get some! (chuckles)

1694
01:42:15.969 --> 01:42:18.889
Who says a .50 caliber
is an impractical round?

1695
01:42:18.972 --> 01:42:19.806
(grunts)

1696
01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:24.937
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1697
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:27.606
(Jonas) Everyone stay still. No motion.

1698
01:42:29.441 --> 01:42:30.484
No, it's okay.

1699
01:42:31.276 --> 01:42:32.611
That's Haiqi.

1700
01:42:32.694 --> 01:42:33.987
Who cares which one it is?

1701
01:42:35.322 --> 01:42:36.156
She'll listen to me.

1702
01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.617
Let's spread out
so that thing don't get us all.

1703
01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:39.785
I got this!

1704
01:42:44.665 --> 01:42:45.874
(device clicks, whistles)

1705
01:43:09.898 --> 01:43:12.025
(gasps, grunts)

1706
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:13.819
Yes! I knew it!

1707
01:43:15.028 --> 01:43:17.447
I told you! We have a special bond.

1708
01:43:17.531 --> 01:43:19.616
-It went after the dolphins.
-No!

1709
01:43:20.534 --> 01:43:23.078
-She obeyed my command.
-Ridiculous.

1710
01:43:24.872 --> 01:43:26.540
I didn't believe it before
and I don't believe it now.

1711
01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:28.250
Hey, Mac, back me up.

1712
01:43:28.375 --> 01:43:30.878
I'm getting out of here
before she changes her mind.

1713
01:43:32.212 --> 01:43:33.046
Mac!

1714
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:35.090
You guys stay there and argue.

1715
01:43:35.174 --> 01:43:36.842
She obeyed my command!

1716
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.887
-Dolphins.
-No!

1717
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:47.311
It's not my fault.

1718
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:50.355
Sometimes, there's a situation
and bad things are happening,

1719
01:43:50.439 --> 01:43:52.232
and you just have to get involved.

1720
01:43:53.567 --> 01:43:55.485
I'm glad you finally understand.

1721
01:43:57.571 --> 01:43:58.655
I'm proud of you.

1722
01:44:01.074 --> 01:44:02.159
(in Mandarin)

1723
01:44:02.242 --> 01:44:03.702
Next time don't run around, ok?

1724
01:44:07.497 --> 01:44:10.626
(pilot over radio) Rescue One
to Fun Island, over.

1725
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:12.753
(DJ) Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, man.

1726
01:44:12.836 --> 01:44:14.880
We got a lot of people who need help.

1727
01:44:19.218 --> 01:44:21.428
(DJ) Yeah, I used to didn't know
how to swim, but then, you know...

1728
01:44:21.595 --> 01:44:24.306
You out there chasing sharks,
you better learn how to swim quick!

1729
01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:25.432
(women laughing)

1730
01:44:25.516 --> 01:44:27.476
The water was cold, it wasn't that cold,
but yeah...

1731
01:44:27.559 --> 01:44:29.394
-I was just having fun!
-(Rigas) What about Haiqi?

1732
01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:32.397
She's still out there. Maybe pregnant.

1733
01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:33.607
Preferably not.

1734
01:44:35.275 --> 01:44:36.443
That's tomorrow.

1735
01:44:36.527 --> 01:44:38.737
Today, we count our blessings.

1736
01:44:39.655 --> 01:44:40.697
Here's to being alive.

1737
01:44:42.199 --> 01:44:43.450
Here's to dolphins.

1738
01:44:44.993 --> 01:44:46.703
-(chuckling)
-To Meiying being safe.

1739
01:44:47.746 --> 01:44:49.623
(Jonas) And here's to Sal,
Lance, and Curtis.

1740
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.794
So...

1741
01:44:54.419 --> 01:44:55.420
am I still grounded?

1742
01:44:59.091 --> 01:45:00.384
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

1743
01:45:05.013 --> 01:45:06.014
(all chuckling)

1744
01:45:06.098 --> 01:45:07.599
You two are ridiculous.

1745
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.853
But I love you anyway.

1746
01:45:14.815 --> 01:45:17.150
Looks like you got
a little reckless out there.

1747
01:45:17.985 --> 01:45:20.988
No, everything was
totally under control.

1748
01:45:21.071 --> 01:45:22.531
-(Jonas) Yeah, right.
-(DJ grunts)

1749
01:45:22.614 --> 01:45:25.158
Well, everything's about to be
totally not under control.

1750
01:45:25.242 --> 01:45:26.326
(DJ chuckles)

1751
01:45:27.286 --> 01:45:28.287
Give me some.

1752
01:45:32.833 --> 01:45:34.168
(DJ) Mmm.

1753
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:36.044
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

1754
01:45:39.047 --> 01:45:40.924
(Jonas and Meiying chuckle)

1755
01:45:41.008 --> 01:45:43.427
(enthralling music playing)

1756
01:46:04.573 --> 01:46:07.284
(upbeat Mandarin song playing)

1757
01:48:13.994 --> 01:48:18.457
