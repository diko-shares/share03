00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:10.377
<i>Thank you, Hilary.</i>

182
00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:17.985
[in Mandarin] As the great
poet Song Lian said...

183
00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:21.122
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

184
00:10:22.223 --> 00:10:26.127
My father named me Jiuming,

185
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.929
which means ocean

186
00:10:28.963 --> 00:10:30.397
or abyss.

187
00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.869
My father and my sister

188
00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:36.971
spent their lives
studying the ocean.

189
00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.673
It wasn't until

190
00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.742
they were both gone
that I began to wonder

191
00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.411
what my purpose was.

192
00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:46.380
But through Suyin's daughter
Meiying,

193
00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.182
I saw that there was a future.

194
00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.385
I merged
my father's research institute

195
00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:53.654
with my company

196
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.690
to carry forward

197
00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:59.793
the spirit of exploring
the unknown in their honor.

198
00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:01.128
[guests cheering]

199
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.167
[in Mandarin] To mark
this tenth anniversary,

200
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.703
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

201
00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:11.205
[device clicks]

202
00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.007
[water sloshing]

203
00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:19.146
[in Mandarin]
Her name is Haiqi.

204
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.448
She is the world's
only megalodon in captivity.

205
00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:24.485
We found her injured as a pup.

206
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.253
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned
a tremendous amount

207
00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:27.821
about the megalodons

208
00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:30.824
as well as the trench
where they live.

209
00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:32.860
[in English] <i>Thanks</i>
<i>to the generous donations</i>

210
00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.728
<i>from our supporters,</i>

211
00:11:34.762 --> 00:11:36.997
<i>we have been able</i>
<i>to create the technology</i>

212
00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:38.999
<i>to pass through</i>
<i>the thermocline,</i>

213
00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:41.902
<i>a thermal layer</i>
<i>of freezing cold water</i>

214
00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:44.805
<i>that separates Haiqi's world</i>
<i>from ours</i>

215
00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:48.876
<i>and into a trench 6,000 meters</i>
<i>below sea level.</i>

216
00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.978
<i>Thanks to you,</i>
<i>we have the ability</i>

217
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:52.947
<i>to go further</i>
<i>than ever before.</i>

218
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.951
[in Mandarin] Love the ocean
and protect the ocean.

219
00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.018
Thank you

220
00:11:58.052 --> 00:11:59.853
[guests cheering]

221
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:03.390
[Driscoll, in English]
<i>And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.</i>

222
00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:05.326
<i>So, thank you all</i>

223
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:09.964
<i>for being part of protecting</i>
<i>this incredible ecosystem.</i>

224
00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.198
[applause]

225
00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:12.366
Thank you for coming.

226
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.034
[greets in Mandarin]

227
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:15.069
[in Mandarin] Do you think
there are more creatures

228
00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:16.036
to be discovered down there?

229
00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:18.205
There has to be.

230
00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:19.773
[Mac, in English]
<i>Who wants to get a selfie</i>

231

<i>-</i> [guests cheering]
<i>-There he is! There he is.</i>

236
00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:34.154
I know this was your idea.

237
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:36.290
-[camera shutter clicking]
-I'm gonna kill you.

238
00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:38.092
Smile and pretend you love it.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:40.227
[Mac] <i>Go on, give him a hug.</i>
<i>Give him a tickle.</i>

00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:43.230
<i>Oh, he loves people.</i>

241
00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:45.266
[waves splashing]

242
00:12:49.537 --> 00:12:51.005
[ominous music playing]

243
00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:57.444
[Meiying] I wanna go
to Mana One with you.

244
00:12:57.478 --> 00:12:58.946
I want to dive the trench.

245
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.081
No.

246
00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:03.183
Sorry, Meiying.

247
00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.386
Why not?

248
00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:08.355
Mom was diving all the time
at my age.

249
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.324
Not to 25,000 feet.

250
00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:13.561
Saying it's too dangerous?

251
00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:14.862
Too dangerous for you.

252
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.299
But not dangerous.

253
00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:21.569
In psychology, they call
that "cognitive dissonance."

254
00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:25.472
In the real world,
they call it "parenting."

255
00:13:25.507 --> 00:13:27.074
You need to start
taking me seriously

256
00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:28.309
as a scientist.

257
00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:31.078
-You're 14.
-Exactly.

258
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:33.113
I know every system
on Mana One,

259
00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:34.915
every dive protocol

260
00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.551
and every animal
we've seen down there.

261
00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:39.887
[sighs] Hey, look.

262
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.221
You can come to Mana One.

263
00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:43.924
To observe the dive.

264
00:13:45.527 --> 00:13:46.860
And that's it. [exhales]

265
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.164
Jiuming is swimming
with the meg.

266
00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:52.567
Uncle.

267
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.101
[indistinct announcement]

268
00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:55.603
[Curtis] Haiqi's vitals
are elevated.

269
00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:58.138
Be careful,
she's definitely aware of you.

270
00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.410
[Jonas, over radio]
<i>Why are you swimming</i>

271
00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:04.878

272
00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:07.081
<i>I'm conducting an experiment.</i>

273
00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.982
Is the experiment
"Do I taste good?"

274
00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:12.986
[in Mandarin]
Uncle, are you crazy?

275
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.556
[in English] <i>It's okay.</i>

276
00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:16.524
<i>I've been training Haiqi</i>
<i>since she was a pup.</i>

277
00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:19.326
A meg is not trainable,
Jiuming.

278
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.228
But if you wanna be eaten

279
00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.665
in front of your niece,
go ahead.

280
00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:26.066
Fifty bucks says
this is gonna end badly.

281
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.468
I'll take that action.

282
00:14:27.502 --> 00:14:29.303
[Sal] I am all in
for team shark.

283
00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:31.972
[DJ] What? You can't bet
on a shark, man.

284
00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:33.240
That's bad karma.

285
00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:35.275
Come on, guys, focus.
That's not cool.

286
00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:37.144
Jiuming...

287
00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:38.445
I'd like
to respectfully suggest

288
00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:40.180
that this is truly
a terrible idea.

289
00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:42.483
Megs and humanity
were never meant to mix.

290

Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

00:17:13.501 --> 00:17:14.669
Well, the Institute's mandate

337
00:17:14.702 --> 00:17:17.237
is to protect the oceans,
right?

338
00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:20.608
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

339
00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:22.175
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

340
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.745
Oh, good.

341
00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:25.613
Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

342
00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:29.584
You're taking
bigger and bigger risks

343
00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:30.852
each time you go out.

344
00:17:30.885 --> 00:17:32.820
Well, I guess
we both know about that.

345
00:17:34.321 --> 00:17:36.089
It's not the same.

With me,

347
00:17:37.424 --> 00:17:39.192
there's a calculation
of risks.

00:17:41.529 --> 00:17:42.830
Not that I see.

00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:57.745

Yes, whenever you're ready?

No worries, no worries.

358
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.576
[Meiying] Mom and Grandpa
talked about you all the time.

359
00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:31.846
Nothing good I suppose.

360
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.881
Wanna guess?

361
00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:39.419
See this scar?

362
00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:42.590
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

363
00:18:42.624 --> 00:18:45.425
So I snuck out to swim with my
friends on the rocky shores...

364
00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:48.328
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

365
00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:50.197
When I returned home my father
taught me a real lesson.

366
00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.700
Grandpa?

367
00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.569
Of course.

368
00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:56.470
He was kind to you
because you're
his granddaughter,

369
00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:59.507
but he was tough on me.

370
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.612
So after college,
I started a company.

371
00:19:04.646 --> 00:19:08.181
I wanted to get away from him.

372
00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:11.586
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather
for many years.

373
00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:15.255
Then he asked your mum
to bring me this calligraphy.

374
00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:17.925
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

375
00:19:17.959 --> 00:19:20.795
I thought it was
a form of ridicule...

376
00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:25.566
but I came to realize that
he wanted me to
find my own way.

704
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:31.766

706
00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:36.537

Make it into
that sea floor station.

718
00:36:05.432 --> 00:36:06.834

We'll go slow and steady.
They'll hold.

723

It's three kilometers.

724
00:36:18.012 --> 00:36:19.914
You'll be defenseless
out there.

What do you want from me, Mac?

726
00:36:21.816 --> 00:36:24.484

[DJ] Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

786
00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:33.507

it'll take another hour

to cover the distance.

00:39:34.675 --> 00:39:36.510
Listen up.

789
00:39:36.544 --> 00:39:38.546
We know there's some kind of
rogue operation in the trench.

790
00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:39.714
Now, some bastard's
got his fingers

1039
00:52:52.339 --> 00:52:53.473

1040
00:52:53.508 --> 00:52:54.909
Three.

1041

[both grunting]

1042
00:52:59.446 --> 00:53:00.648
-[Jiuming] Again.
-It's not gonna work.

[both grunting]

1044
00:53:12.325 --> 00:53:13.360
After you.

1045
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:18.833
[Rigas] Ah,
this is more like it.

1046
00:53:18.866 --> 00:53:20.868
Let's crack open a pod
and get out of here.

1047
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.972
[Jiuming] Nothing here.

1048
00:53:25.006 --> 00:53:26.874
These controls ain't working.

1049
00:53:26.908 --> 00:53:28.341
We need to close the hatch.

1050
00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:29.476
[Rigas] On it.

1051
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:30.812
[hatch whirring]

1052
00:53:33.915 --> 00:53:36.316
Guys, that wasn't me.

1053
00:53:38.418 --> 00:53:40.888
<i>Jonas,</i>
<i>now that I have you here,</i>

1054
00:53:40.922 --> 00:53:42.489
<i>we need to talk candidly.</i>

1055
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:44.025
<i>I have full control</i>
<i>of the station,</i>

1056
00:53:44.058 --> 00:53:45.693
<i>and I've locked down</i>
<i>this room.</i>

1057
00:53:45.727 --> 00:53:46.861
Jess?

1058
00:53:46.894 --> 00:53:48.596
<i>Your life is in my hands.</i>

1059
00:53:48.629 --> 00:53:49.797
What are you doing, Jess?

1060
00:53:52.332 --> 00:53:54.669
These are your friends.

1061
00:53:54.702 --> 00:53:56.369
They've been with you
for years.

1062
00:53:56.403 --> 00:53:57.839
<i>I know it hurts.</i>

1063
00:53:57.872 --> 00:53:59.439
<i>And we're talking</i>
<i>because I'd prefer</i>

1064
00:53:59.473 --> 00:54:01.341
<i>we were on the same side.</i>

1065
00:54:01.374 --> 00:54:03.511
<i>All making so much money,</i>
<i>it ceases to have meaning.</i>

1066
00:54:03.544 --> 00:54:04.879
You're offering us money?

1067
00:54:07.582 --> 00:54:09.817
Three of our friends are dead
because of you.

1068
00:54:09.851 --> 00:54:11.753
You think
I'm gonna forget about that?

1069
00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:17.992
No, no, no, no, no!
That's the first escape pod!

1070
00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:19.560
Son of a bitch!

1071
00:54:19.594 --> 00:54:23.698
<i>Rigas?</i>
<i>Rigas, you can save Meiying.</i>

1072
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:26.601
<i>Take that speargun</i>
<i>and shoot Jonas in the heart.</i>

1073
00:54:29.003 --> 00:54:30.004
[slurps]

1074

[breathing heavily]

1075
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:49.891
Don't shoot him.

1076
00:54:53.728 --> 00:54:55.362
[breathing heavily]

1077
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:03.771
Do it.

1078
00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:05.706
Go ahead.

1079
00:55:07.942 --> 00:55:09.877
It's the only way
Meiying survives.

1080
00:55:14.015 --> 00:55:15.315
Do it.

1081
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.451
Rigas!

1082
00:55:19.787 --> 00:55:21.522
Do it!

1083
00:55:21.556 --> 00:55:24.091
[Rigas breathing heavily,
shuddering]

1084
00:55:24.125 --> 00:55:26.027
-Do it!
-No. I'm sorry.

1085
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.797
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't. I can't. [exhales]

1086
00:55:29.831 --> 00:55:31.464

1087

[breath trembling]

1088
00:55:37.638 --> 00:55:39.372
That was the last pod.

1089
00:55:41.509 --> 00:55:43.644
<i>I told you that wouldn't work.</i>

1090
00:55:43.678 --> 00:55:44.745
Put me on.

1091
00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:49.784
[Driscoll] <i>Oh, sorry</i>
<i>it had to come to this.</i>

1092
00:55:50.918 --> 00:55:52.419
<i>So...</i>

1093
00:55:52.452 --> 00:55:53.921
we'll be back at work
in a week,

1094
00:55:53.955 --> 00:55:57.892
using your technology
to take whatever we want.

1095
00:55:57.925 --> 00:56:01.529
<i>Your institute'll be</i>
<i>a platform that we use</i>

1096
00:56:01.562 --> 00:56:04.866
to plunder the ocean
for decades.

1097
00:56:04.899 --> 00:56:06.667
[in Mandarin]
Karma will get you.

1098
00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:07.635
[Driscoll in English]
<i>And before you start whining</i>

1099
00:56:07.668 --> 00:56:08.970
<i>about the ecosystem,</i>

1100
00:56:09.003 --> 00:56:10.972
<i>who cares?</i>
<i>We'll make billions.</i>

1101
00:56:11.005 --> 00:56:13.507
<i>And no one is going to see</i>
<i>the damage we do.</i>

1102
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:14.575
[in Mandarin] Shut up!

1103
00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:18.112
[Driscoll, in English] <i>Jess,</i>
<i>I've already dispatched</i>

1104
00:56:18.145 --> 00:56:20.615
<i>a clean-up crew to Mana One.</i>

1105
00:56:20.648 --> 00:56:21.716
<i>Finish this.</i>

1106
00:56:23.718 --> 00:56:24.752
[metal thuds]

1107
00:56:26.153 --> 00:56:28.890
[Rigas] How do we
open the door?

1108
00:56:28.923 --> 00:56:31.125
[Jiuming] If we could
cut the comm link
to the surface...

1109
00:56:32.193 --> 00:56:33.728
she couldn't control anything.

1110
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:35.096
[Rigas] But it's back
in the first room,

1111
00:56:35.129 --> 00:56:37.131
and there's no getting through
this door.

1112
00:56:37.164 --> 00:56:39.166
This airlock still works!

1113
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.569
Why would you go through
the airlock? There's no pod.

1114
00:56:41.602 --> 00:56:43.671
I'll swim to the airlock
where we came in

1115
00:56:43.704 --> 00:56:45.006
and do the override.

1116
00:56:45.039 --> 00:56:48.109
You have no suit.
How could it work?

1117
00:56:48.142 --> 00:56:50.144
[Rigas] Water doesn't compress
under pressure,

1118
00:56:50.177 --> 00:56:52.213
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

1119
00:56:52.246 --> 00:56:54.849
he could survive 30,
maybe 60 seconds

1120
00:56:54.882 --> 00:56:56.183
before he passes out.

1121
00:56:56.217 --> 00:56:57.518
-It is possible.
-[breathes deeply]

1122
00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:01.822
We work the problems
one by one.

1123

[breathing heavily]

1124
00:57:03.658 --> 00:57:06.527
We do what's in front of us,
then we do the next thing.

[hatch whirring]

1126
00:57:14.635 --> 00:57:16.137
[Jiuming] If anyone
can do this,

1127
00:57:16.837 --> 00:57:17.838
it's you.

00:57:24.278 --> 00:57:25.478
[machine buzzes]

1129
00:57:35.656 --> 00:57:38.059
[Meiying] Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

1130
00:57:38.092 --> 00:57:39.961
[Rigas] It doesn't work
like that.

1131
00:57:39.994 --> 00:57:43.698
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

1132
00:57:43.731 --> 00:57:46.767
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

1133
00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:49.537
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

had our ship seized.

-[Jonas] Hey, Rigas.
-Yep?

1211
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.835
For a moment, I thought you
were gonna kill me back there.

1212
01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:24.305
[sighs] Well, she did say
to shoot you in the heart.

1213
01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:26.541
And I know for a fact
you ain't got one of those.

1214
01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:27.941
[chuckles]

1215
01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.343
[grunts, breathes heavily]

1216
01:03:31.912 --> 01:03:33.147
[in Mandarin]
Thank you for working.

1217
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:43.490
[Rigas grunts]

1218
01:03:43.525 --> 01:03:45.125
[electricity crackling]

1219
01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:47.127
[Rigas grunting]

1220
01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:48.530
[in English] Gotta close
the hatch, Jonas.

1221
01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:49.531
[Jonas yelps]

1222
01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:51.398
[metal creaking]

1223
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.034
We're all gonna die.

1224
01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:55.570
[grunting]

1225
01:03:55.603 --> 01:03:56.638
He's gonna make it.

1226
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:57.838
No, he's not.

1227
01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:01.041
[Jiuming yelps]

1228
01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:02.242
-He's gonna make it.
-No!

1229
01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:04.244
We have to close the hatch!

1230
01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:05.613
[screams, grunts]

1231
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:10.518
-[Rigas] Close it! Jonas!
-[alarm blaring]

1232
01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:17.559
[gasps]

1233
01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.494
[Jiuming] I'm here!

1234
01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:22.396
[grunts]

1235
01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:23.897
-[Jonas] That's him!
-[grunts]

1236
01:04:33.307 --> 01:04:35.275
[panting]

1237
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:36.377
[Jonas] That was close.

1238
01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:39.179
Too close.

1239
01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:44.118
You should have shut
the hatch.

1240
01:04:44.151 --> 01:04:46.019
Yeah.
Meiying would have killed me.

1241
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.693
You thought about it, though.

1242
01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:53.193
Yeah. We thought about it.

1243
01:04:53.994 --> 01:04:55.095
Didn't we, Rigas?

1244
01:04:55.129 --> 01:04:56.930
[sighs] Shut up.

1245
01:04:57.965 --> 01:05:00.000
Just a little bit.

1246
01:05:00.033 --> 01:05:01.636
[in Mandarin] Very funny.

1247
01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:03.036
[chuckling]

1248
01:05:09.977 --> 01:05:11.145
[Jiuming, in English]
Explosives?

1249
01:05:12.614 --> 01:05:13.615
Check this out.

1250
01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:15.349
Look what else.

1251
01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:30.130
[Meiying] Is that gonna be
a problem?

1252
01:05:30.164 --> 01:05:32.299
[Jiuming] It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

1253
01:05:32.332 --> 01:05:35.402
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

1254
01:05:35.436 --> 01:05:37.004
It will seal up eventually.

1255
01:05:37.639 --> 01:05:39.306
Eventually?

1256
01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:41.709
Yeah. Within an hour.

1257
01:05:41.743 --> 01:05:43.678
[Meiying] Can the megs
follow us through?

1258
01:05:44.779 --> 01:05:46.113
[Jiuming] I hope not.

1259
01:06:05.165 --> 01:06:06.366
[grunting]

1260
01:06:10.471 --> 01:06:12.406
Boys,
I don't want to harm you,

1261
01:06:12.439 --> 01:06:14.475
but I do need you
to come out of this room.

1262
01:06:14.509 --> 01:06:16.678
It's Jess.
She's got three soldiers.

1263
01:06:17.812 --> 01:06:19.446
[DJ] Yeah. It's go time.

1264
01:06:20.414 --> 01:06:21.616
Take this.

1265
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:23.050
-The hell is this?
-It's a Taser.

1266
01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:25.452
Open up.

1267
01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:26.688
They tried to kill Jonas,

1268
01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.021
they're definitely
gonna kill us.

1269
01:06:28.055 --> 01:06:29.423
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

1270
01:06:29.456 --> 01:06:31.358
On the count of three,
you'll open the door

1271
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:33.160
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

1272
01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:34.394
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

1273
01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:36.163
Then go out there
and use the Taser.

1274
01:06:36.196 --> 01:06:37.665
One, two, three.

1275
01:06:39.132 --> 01:06:40.802
[mercenaries screaming,
groaning]

1276
01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:43.638
-[DJ] No, Mac, no! No, Mac...
-[Mac screams]

1277
01:06:43.671 --> 01:06:46.541
[Mac] It burns! It burns!
[screaming]

1278
01:06:46.574 --> 01:06:48.108
-[DJ] I'm sorry!
-[Taser crackling]

1279
01:06:48.141 --> 01:06:49.611
Sleepy time.

1280
01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:51.646
[suspenseful music playing]

1281
01:07:04.324 --> 01:07:05.325
-What's that?
-[computer beeping]

1282
01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:09.396
Trouble.

1283
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:19.641
[Rigas] So, we're walking fast
and with

1284
01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:21.709
a lot of determination,
which is great.

1285
01:07:21.743 --> 01:07:24.077
But what exactly
is the plan here?

1286
01:07:24.111 --> 01:07:25.379
They're armed and we're not.

1287
01:07:29.283 --> 01:07:30.685
[breathes deeply]

1288
01:07:30.718 --> 01:07:32.252
[Rigas] All righty.
So what are you thinking?

1289
01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:35.590
What are you thinking?

1290
01:07:35.623 --> 01:07:37.291
You and I find Mac and DJ.

1291
01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:38.760
Rigas, grab what you can.

1292
01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:40.193
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

1293
01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:41.563
[exhales] Rock and roll.

1294
01:07:41.596 --> 01:07:43.297
Safest if Meiying
goes with you.

1295
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.299
[indistinct radio chatter]

1296
01:07:51.573 --> 01:07:53.608
I'll protect her with my life.

1297
01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:54.742
And I'll protect her
with mine.

1298
01:07:55.543 --> 01:07:56.544
No.

1299
01:07:56.578 --> 01:07:57.745
No.

1300
01:07:57.779 --> 01:07:58.846
[Jonas] No.

1301
01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.281
Let's go.

1302
01:08:13.528 --> 01:08:15.630
[DJ] I told you to wait
before you went out that door.

1303
01:08:15.663 --> 01:08:17.632
-How's your eyes?
-My eye stings.

1304
01:08:17.665 --> 01:08:20.602
[grunts] If we climb up
to the communications array,

1305
01:08:20.635 --> 01:08:22.804
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

1306
01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:24.171
What are we supposed to say?

1307
01:08:24.204 --> 01:08:26.440
Uh... terrorist action?

1308
01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:28.810
-Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
-Yeah, terrorist action.

1309
01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:30.310
-[DJ] Okay.
-You got a better idea?

1310
01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:31.813
-[mercenary] Freeze!
-[Mac yelps]

1311
01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:32.847
Oh, no.

[all grunting]

1313
01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:44.358
DJ! DJ!

[grunts]

1315
01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:47.427
What the hell?

1316
01:08:47.461 --> 01:08:50.598
Wow! Yeah, baby!
Get some!

1317
01:08:50.632 --> 01:08:51.799
-Hey.
-Run, Mac! Run!

1318

[both scream]

1321
01:09:06.914 --> 01:09:08.549
[mercenary] Spread out!
Find 'em.

1322
01:09:11.853 --> 01:09:14.822
[grunts] You got Tasers?
Now you can swim?

1323
01:09:14.856 --> 01:09:17.759
All of a sudden you run around
like you're frickin' Batman.

1324
01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:20.193
-Hell yeah.
-[both panting]

1325
01:09:20.227 --> 01:09:23.497
After last time,
y'all begged me to come back.

1326
01:09:23.531 --> 01:09:26.534
-"DJ, oh, we family, DJ."
-[gunfire]

1327
01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:29.469
"DJ, we need you."
Yeah, all right. Bet.

1328
01:09:29.504 --> 01:09:30.805
But I ain't stupid.

1329
01:09:30.838 --> 01:09:32.205
I trained up,
I learned how to fight,

1330
01:09:32.239 --> 01:09:33.741
I learned how to swim,

1331
01:09:33.775 --> 01:09:35.743
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

1332
01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:37.411
-Survival pack?
-Yeah.

1333
01:09:37.444 --> 01:09:38.680
Check this out.

1334
01:09:38.713 --> 01:09:40.815
Mmm-hmm. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1335
01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:43.417
Bam. [exhales]

1336
01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:46.253
Yeah, I even made
poison-tipped bullets,

1337
01:09:46.286 --> 01:09:48.388
just like <i>Jaws 2.</i>

-[DJ grunts]
-[mercenaries scream]

1339
01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:53.594
Come on, DJ!
Let's go, let's go.

1340
01:09:55.897 --> 01:09:57.330
[both panting]

1341
01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:58.331
This is insane.

1342
01:10:01.903 --> 01:10:03.403
[mercenary 1] Freeze, assholes.

1343
01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:07.575
[mercenary 2] Yeah, freeze.

1344
01:10:07.608 --> 01:10:08.676
You got this?

1345
01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:15.449
[DJ] That was some
unfortunate shit back there.

1346
01:10:15.482 --> 01:10:17.552
[Jiuming] No, please!
Don't shoot!

1347
01:10:17.585 --> 01:10:20.253
[grunts, gasps]

1348
01:10:20.287 --> 01:10:21.723
[in Mandarin] I know you're
looking for me and Jonas.

1349
01:10:21.756 --> 01:10:23.323
I also know
you don't speak Chinese,

1350
01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:26.027
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

1351
01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.563
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

1352
01:10:28.596 --> 01:10:29.897
[in English] What?

1353
01:10:29.931 --> 01:10:31.933

I thought you were dead.

-[Jiuming grunts]
-Wishful thinking, Mac.

[DJ] If it ain't
the deviated septum.

1361

-Boat's leaving.
-[DJ scoffs]

1362
01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:53.921
[Jess] What's our status?

1363
01:10:53.955 --> 01:10:54.889

ETA, ten minutes.

1365
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.024
Excellent.

1366
01:10:58.826 --> 01:11:00.327
Uh, what are you doing here?

1367
01:11:01.629 --> 01:11:02.630
[Jess chuckles]

1368

-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1371
01:11:10.705 --> 01:11:12.907
Jonas is on Mana One.

1372
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.810
We need to lock this place
down now.

-[sighs]
-[tablet beeps]

1374
01:11:17.912 --> 01:11:19.781
Search the station
top to bottom.

Secure personnel
in their quarters,

1376
01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:22.617
kill anyone else.

Go! Go!

Oh, my God.

1379
01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:40.400
Uh, guys?

1380
01:11:41.102 --> 01:11:43.538
We've got a big problem.
