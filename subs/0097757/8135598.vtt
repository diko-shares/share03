00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:55.088
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

52
00:05:55.128 --> 00:05:57.330
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

53
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.010
Yeah, I got this cough.

54
00:06:01.051 --> 00:06:03.490
All right. I'm going inside.

55
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.651

56
00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:06.770
OK.

57
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:08.971
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...

58
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.891
What? Sharks? Ariel!

59
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.012

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:21.374
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

62
00:06:21.453 --> 00:06:24.213
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

63
00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:26.173
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

64
00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.213
I'm not a guppy.

65
00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:32.054
This is great.

66
00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:34.934
I mean, I really love this.

67
00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:39.614
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner...

68
00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:42.975
Ariel!

69
00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:46.576
Oh, are you OK?

70
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.696
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.

71
00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:50.656
Shh!

72
00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:58.816

wonderful in your entire life?

74
00:07:02.418 --> 00:07:05.979
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?

75
00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:09.018
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

76
00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.978
What was that?

77
00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:12.738
Did you hear something?

78
00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:15.099
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

79
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.139
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

80
00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:20.379
Nothing is going to happen.

81
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.419
Shark!

82
00:07:22.498 --> 00:07:25.141
Shark! We're gonna die!

83
00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:42.941
Oh, no!

85
00:08:15.907 --> 00:08:17.827

00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:19.427

Ariel, how you doin', kid?

93
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:43.270
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

94
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.150
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

95
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.391
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.

96
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.313
Oh! Oh! Look at this.

97
00:08:57.392 --> 00:09:00.672
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

98
00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:04.593
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

99
00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:07.833
Humans use these little babies...

100
00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:09.792
to straighten their hair out.

101
00:09:09.872 --> 00:09:14.433
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...

102
00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:18.275
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

103
00:09:18.355 --> 00:09:20.355
that humans go nuts over.

104
00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.355
A dinglehopper.

105
00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:24.075
- What about that one?
- Ah!

106
00:09:24.154 --> 00:09:29.716
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

107
00:09:29.796 --> 00:09:34.835
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!

108
00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:39.917
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

109
00:09:39.998 --> 00:09:43.118
and stare at each other all day.

110
00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:45.078
Got very boring.

111
00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:49.479
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

112
00:09:49.558 --> 00:09:51.758
Allow me.

113
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.238
Music!

114
00:09:53.318 --> 00:09:55.520
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

115
00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:57.878
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!

116
00:09:57.959 --> 00:09:59.281
The concert was today?

117
00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:01.480
You could make
a little planter out of it.

118
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:04.760
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

119
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.321
Any time, sweetie!

120
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:08.440
Any time.

121
00:10:21.723 --> 00:10:25.565
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

122
00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:30.844
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

123
00:10:30.884 --> 00:10:35.323
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

124
00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:40.204
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

125
00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:44.326
when I lived in the palace.

126
00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:47.966
And now look at me.

127
00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:50.726
Wasted away to practically nothing.

128
00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:54.686
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

129
00:10:54.768 --> 00:10:59.607
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

130
00:10:59.647 --> 00:11:04.486
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

131
00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:06.649
Flotsam! Jetsam!

132
00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:11.770
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

133
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.689
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

134
00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:24.250
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

135
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.849
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

136
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.931
As a result of your careless behavior...

137
00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:29.772
Careless and reckless behavior!

138
00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:31.972
...the entire celebration was, uh...

139
00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:35.571
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

140
00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:37.692
This concert was to be

141
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:41.213
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

142
00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:44.892
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

143
00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:46.493
But it wasn't her fault...

144
00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:50.093
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

145
00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:53.535
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

146
00:11:53.575 --> 00:11:56.655
And... And we... Whoa!

147
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.575
And then we were safe.

148
00:11:58.655 --> 00:12:01.294
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

149
00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.976
Seagull?

150
00:12:03.015 --> 00:12:05.654
What? Oh!

151
00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.735
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

152
00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:10.175
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

153
00:12:10.215 --> 00:12:14.297
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

154
00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:18.817
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

155
00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:21.337
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

156
00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:25.218
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

157
00:12:25.298 --> 00:12:27.698
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

158
00:12:27.778 --> 00:12:30.338
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

159
00:12:30.457 --> 00:12:33.739
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

160
00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:36.580
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

161
00:12:36.619 --> 00:12:40.860
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

162
00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:42.820
Is that clear?

163
00:12:47.821 --> 00:12:50.301
Hmph! Teenagers.

164
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.581
They think they know everything.

165
00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:56.143
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

166
00:12:56.222 --> 00:13:00.062
Do you think I was too hard on her?

167
00:13:00.143 --> 00:13:02.183
Definitely not.

168
00:13:02.223 --> 00:13:07.104
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

169
00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:10.623
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

170
00:13:10.703 --> 00:13:13.423
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

171
00:13:13.503 --> 00:13:16.144
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

172
00:13:16.224 --> 00:13:18.785
Ariel needs constant supervision.

173
00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:21.505
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

174
00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:22.626
All the time.

175
00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:25.226

Ariel, are you OK?

make him understand.

183
00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:25.674
I just don't see things the way he does.

184
00:14:25.754 --> 00:14:29.755

237
00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:50.539
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

238
00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:52.979
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

Come with me, I'll take you home

241
00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:01.059
and get you something warm to drink.

242
00:18:01.139 --> 00:18:03.900
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

243
00:18:05.262 --> 00:18:07.702
Ariel?

244
00:18:17.302 --> 00:18:20.463

245
00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:23.022
Jumpin' jellyfish!

246
00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:29.584
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!

247
00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:08.628
Max! Here, boy!

248
00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:17.630
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

249
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.510
Come on, Max.

250
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.790
Good boy. Good boy.

251
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.552
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

252
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:33.952
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

253
00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:36.272
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

254
00:19:36.353 --> 00:19:39.952
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

255
00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:43.832
I've never seen a human
this close before.

256
00:19:43.912 --> 00:19:48.834
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

257
00:19:48.913 --> 00:19:52.193
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

258
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.953
Not that one.

259
00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:58.035
The one playing the snarfblatt.

260
00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:00.675
Silence, silence.

261
00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:03.555
It is now my honor and privilege

262
00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:05.836
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

263
00:20:05.915 --> 00:20:08.515
with a very special, very expensive,

264
00:20:08.596 --> 00:20:11.315
very large birthday present.

265
00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:14.796
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

266
00:20:14.836 --> 00:20:16.676
I know.

267
00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.438
Happy birthday, Eric.

268
00:20:24.238 --> 00:20:26.877
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!

269
00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:30.278
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.

270
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.279
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

271
00:20:32.358 --> 00:20:36.159
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

272
00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:38.559
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

273
00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:42.681
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?

274
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.920
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.

275
00:20:45.962 --> 00:20:51.401
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled with the right girl.

276
00:20:51.481 --> 00:20:54.241
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...

277
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:57.161
I just haven't found her yet.

278
00:20:57.241 --> 00:21:00.362
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

279
00:21:00.442 --> 00:21:03.004
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

280
00:21:03.083 --> 00:21:07.564
Without a doubt, it'll just...
bam... hit me, like lightning.

281
00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:14.764
Hurricane a-comin'!

282
00:21:14.845 --> 00:21:19.844

on the move here! Yo!

Is he... dead?

00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:52.183
It's hard to say.

Ariel dear, time to come out.

327
00:26:31.642 --> 00:26:33.564
You've been in there all morning.

328
00:26:36.806 --> 00:26:39.606
What is with her lately?

329
00:26:42.005 --> 00:26:46.646
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!

330
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:54.728
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

331
00:26:54.808 --> 00:26:58.489
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

332
00:26:58.528 --> 00:27:02.567
Ariel? In love?

333
00:27:02.648 --> 00:27:05.168
OK. So far, so good.

334
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:08.248
I don't think the king knows.

something like this a secret for long.

336
00:27:12.849 --> 00:27:16.248
He loves me.

337
00:27:16.328 --> 00:27:19.250
Mmm. He loves me not.

338
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.611
He loves me! I knew it!

339
00:27:23.691 --> 00:27:25.530
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

343
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.252
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

344
00:27:38.332 --> 00:27:40.893
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!

Ariel, listen to me.

346

Sebastian!

Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

406
00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:04.078
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

407
00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.238
The sea king?

408
00:31:06.318 --> 00:31:09.678
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

409
00:31:09.814 --> 00:31:12.278
Oh, he knows!

410
00:31:12.358 --> 00:31:15.158
Hey, let's see now.

411
00:31:15.198 --> 00:31:19.240
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

412
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:26.000
Come in, Sebastian.

413
00:31:26.848 --> 00:31:28.929
I mustn't overreact.

414
00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:32.441
I must remain calm.

415
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:39.842
Yes?

416
00:31:39.921 --> 00:31:42.803
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

417
00:31:42.843 --> 00:31:45.924
I'm concerned about Ariel.

418
00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:49.204
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

419
00:31:49.244 --> 00:31:54.043
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

420
00:31:54.124 --> 00:31:57.683
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

421
00:31:57.763 --> 00:31:59.763
You haven't noticed, hmm?

422
00:31:59.803 --> 00:32:02.524
Oh, well, I...

423
00:32:02.605 --> 00:32:05.887
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

424
00:32:06.846 --> 00:32:10.647
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

425
00:32:10.687 --> 00:32:13.806
Keeping something?

426
00:32:13.886 --> 00:32:15.727
About Ariel?

427
00:32:18.727 --> 00:32:22.048
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

428
00:32:22.088 --> 00:32:27.409
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

429
00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:30.489
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

430
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.090
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

431
00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:38.569
Humans?

432
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.129
Who said anything about humans?

433
00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:45.310
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

434
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.450
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

435
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:51.012
You'll see. It's a surprise.

436
00:32:51.092 --> 00:32:53.052
Oh, Flounder.

437
00:32:55.052 --> 00:32:56.971
Flounder, you're the best!

438
00:32:57.052 --> 00:33:01.412
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

439
00:33:01.492 --> 00:33:06.332
Why, Eric, run away with you?

440
00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:09.973
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

441
00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:15.095
Daddy?

442
00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:22.176
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

443
00:33:22.255 --> 00:33:27.015
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

444
00:33:27.095 --> 00:33:28.535
But, Dad, I...

445
00:33:28.616 --> 00:33:31.736
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

446
00:33:31.815 --> 00:33:32.738
I had to...

447
00:33:32.818 --> 00:33:36.258
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

448
00:33:36.377 --> 00:33:39.018
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

449
00:33:39.057 --> 00:33:42.458
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

450
00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:44.698
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

451
00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:47.738
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

452
00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:50.139
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

453
00:33:50.218 --> 00:33:51.578
incapable of any feeling...

454
00:33:51.658 --> 00:33:54.459
Daddy, I love him!

455
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.620
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

456
00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:00.541
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

457
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.021
I don't care.

458
00:34:02.101 --> 00:34:06.060
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

459
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.861
And if this is the only way, so be it!

460
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.181
Daddy! No!

461
00:34:15.262 --> 00:34:17.743
No! Please!

462
00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:21.383
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

463
00:34:23.983 --> 00:34:26.103
Daddy, no!

464
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:50.546
Ariel, I...

465
00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:52.826
Just go away.

466
00:35:10.428 --> 00:35:15.789
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

467
00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:20.589
She has a very serious problem.

468
00:35:20.629 --> 00:35:23.832
If only there were
something we could do.

469
00:35:23.911 --> 00:35:26.712
But there is something.

470
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:31.271
Who... Who are you?

471
00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:33.471
Don't be scared.

472
00:35:33.551 --> 00:35:36.631
We represent someone who can help you.

473
00:35:36.712 --> 00:35:41.592
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

474
00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:43.632
Just imagine...

475
00:35:43.672 --> 00:35:45.595
You and your prince...

476
00:35:45.675 --> 00:35:49.074
Together forever.

477
00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:50.995
I don't understand.

478
00:35:51.034 --> 00:35:56.635
Ursula has great powers.

479
00:35:56.715 --> 00:36:00.515
The sea witch?

480
00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:03.715
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

481
00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:06.716
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

482
00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:08.916
Suit yourself.

483
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:13.077
It was only a suggestion.

484
00:36:22.278 --> 00:36:23.276
Wait.

485
00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:26.638
Yes?

486
00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:30.840
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

487
00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:33.619
It was an accident.

488
00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:36.280
Ariel? Where are you going?

489
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.839
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

490
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:40.761
I'm going to see Ursula.

491
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:45.080
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

492
00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.320
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

493
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.002
But... But, I... Come on!

494
00:37:07.843 --> 00:37:09.443
This way.

495
00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:30.686
Come in. Come in, my child.

496
00:37:30.765 --> 00:37:35.808
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

497
00:37:35.847 --> 00:37:39.649
One might question
your upbringing.

498
00:37:41.328 --> 00:37:44.049
Now, then, you're here

499
00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:48.887
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

500
00:37:48.969 --> 00:37:54.330
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

501
00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:56.810
Well, angelfish,

502
00:37:56.889 --> 00:38:01.571
the solution to your problem is simple.

503
00:38:01.611 --> 00:38:03.570
The only way to get what you want

504
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:05.571
is to become a human yourself.

505
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.611
Can you do that?

506
00:38:10.131 --> 00:38:14.892
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

507
00:38:14.931 --> 00:38:16.891
It's what I live for.

508
00:38:16.972 --> 00:38:21.054

Now, here's the deal.

536
00:39:42.423 --> 00:39:47.424
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

537
00:39:47.505 --> 00:39:49.944
Got that? Three days.

538
00:39:50.024 --> 00:39:52.664
Now, listen, this is important.

539
00:39:52.745 --> 00:39:55.025
Before the sun sets on the third day,

540
00:39:55.065 --> 00:39:59.345
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

541
00:39:59.385 --> 00:40:02.185
That is, he's got to kiss you.

542
00:40:02.265 --> 00:40:07.506
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

543
00:40:07.546 --> 00:40:11.147
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

544
00:40:11.228 --> 00:40:15.027
you'll remain human permanently.

545
00:40:15.107 --> 00:40:18.467
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...

546
00:40:18.588 --> 00:40:22.468
and... you belong to me!

547
00:40:22.507 --> 00:40:25.229
No, Ariel!

548
00:40:25.308 --> 00:40:27.548
Have we got a deal?

549
00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:29.788
If I become human,

550
00:40:29.868 --> 00:40:32.510
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

551
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.790
That's right!

552
00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:37.991
But you'll have your man.

553
00:40:38.071 --> 00:40:43.229
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

554
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:49.150
Oh! And there is one more thing.

555
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.671
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

556
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.713
You can't get something for nothing.

557
00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:56.113
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

558
00:40:56.193 --> 00:41:00.193
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

559
00:41:00.273 --> 00:41:04.512
What I want from you is... your voice.

560
00:41:04.592 --> 00:41:08.554
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

561
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:12.114
No more talking, singing. Zip!

562
00:41:12.193 --> 00:41:14.073
But without my voice, how can I...

563
00:41:14.154 --> 00:41:17.876
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

564
00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:22.796
And don't underestimate the
importance of body language!

565
00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:23.796

594
00:43:45.852 --> 00:43:50.655
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

595
00:43:50.735 --> 00:43:54.535
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

596
00:44:12.658 --> 00:44:17.418
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

597
00:44:17.498 --> 00:44:20.018
Look at ya. Look at ya.

598
00:44:20.058 --> 00:44:23.218
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

599
00:44:23.298 --> 00:44:25.938
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

600
00:44:25.978 --> 00:44:27.978
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?

601
00:44:29.498 --> 00:44:31.858
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.

602
00:44:31.939 --> 00:44:34.780
New seashells?

603
00:44:34.821 --> 00:44:37.180
No new seashells.

604
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.701
I gotta admit I can't
put my foot on it right now.

605
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:41.300
If I stand here long enough...

606
00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:42.740
She's got legs, you idiot!

607
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.020
She traded her voice to the sea
witch and got legs. Geez, man!

608
00:44:47.102 --> 00:44:48.501
I knew that.

609
00:44:48.581 --> 00:44:50.461
Ariel's been turned into a human.

610
00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:54.621
She's gotta make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.

611
00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:58.263
And she's only got three days!

612
00:44:58.343 --> 00:45:01.184
Just look at her!

613
00:45:01.224 --> 00:45:04.064
On legs! On human legs!

614
00:45:04.104 --> 00:45:08.384
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

615
00:45:08.464 --> 00:45:11.303
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.

616
00:45:11.344 --> 00:45:14.463
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!

617
00:45:14.543 --> 00:45:17.344
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now

618
00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:19.866
and tell him just like I should
have done the minute...

619
00:45:19.945 --> 00:45:23.265
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.

620
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:25.305
Maybe there's still time.

621
00:45:25.346 --> 00:45:27.986
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,

622
00:45:28.065 --> 00:45:31.387
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...

623
00:45:31.466 --> 00:45:34.866
Just be...

624
00:45:34.947 --> 00:45:39.946
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

625
00:45:41.908 --> 00:45:44.829
All right, all right.

626
00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:48.789
I'll try to help ya find that prince.

627
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:55.588
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

628
00:45:55.669 --> 00:45:57.629
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

629
00:45:57.668 --> 00:46:01.510
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.

630
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:11.151
Max? What?

631
00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:13.913
Huh? What? Max!

632
00:46:15.112 --> 00:46:18.272
Ya look great, kid.

633
00:46:18.352 --> 00:46:22.152
Ya look sensational.

634
00:46:32.274 --> 00:46:35.035
Max!

635
00:46:35.114 --> 00:46:36.555
Max!

636
00:46:36.634 --> 00:46:39.035
Quiet, Max.

637
00:46:39.114 --> 00:46:41.594
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

638
00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:45.155
Oh, I see.

639
00:46:45.196 --> 00:46:48.197
Are you OK, miss?

640
00:46:48.237 --> 00:46:50.477
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

641
00:46:50.557 --> 00:46:52.677
He's harmless really, uh...

642
00:46:54.597 --> 00:46:59.198
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

643
00:47:01.757 --> 00:47:03.517
We have met. I knew it.

644
00:47:03.598 --> 00:47:05.798
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

645
00:47:05.837 --> 00:47:08.077
What's your name?

646
00:47:08.157 --> 00:47:11.520
What's wrong? What is it?

647
00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:17.640
You can't speak? Oh!

648
00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.200
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

649
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.760
What is it? You're hurt?

650
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.401
No, no. You need help?

651
00:47:30.481 --> 00:47:33.002
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

652
00:47:34.203 --> 00:47:37.043
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

653
00:47:37.122 --> 00:47:39.162
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

654
00:47:39.242 --> 00:47:41.082
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.

655
00:47:48.563 --> 00:47:51.283
Washed up from a shipwreck.

656
00:47:51.363 --> 00:47:54.365
Oh, the poor thing.

657
00:47:54.445 --> 00:47:57.566
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

658
00:48:00.246 --> 00:48:04.166
I'll just... I'll just
get this washed for you.

659
00:48:08.245 --> 00:48:10.445
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

660
00:48:10.485 --> 00:48:12.366
- No!
- Gertrude says...

661
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:14.486
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

662
00:48:15.808 --> 00:48:17.689
- Really.
- Madam, please...

663
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:21.048
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

664
00:48:21.088 --> 00:48:23.088
If Eric's looking for a girl,

665
00:48:23.168 --> 00:48:26.488
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.

666
00:48:38.251 --> 00:48:39.411
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

667
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.570
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

668
00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:44.051
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people

669
00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:47.211
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...

670
00:48:47.292 --> 00:48:49.411
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

671
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.691
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

672
00:48:52.731 --> 00:48:56.852
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

673
00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.934
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

674
00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:08.893
Uh, you look wonderful.

675
00:49:08.933 --> 00:49:14.174
Come, come, come. You must be
famished. Let me help you, my dear.

676
00:49:14.213 --> 00:49:16.535
There we go. That's better.

677
00:49:16.574 --> 00:49:20.214
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.

678
00:49:20.294 --> 00:49:25.217
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

679
00:49:36.257 --> 00:49:40.457
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.

680
00:49:42.097 --> 00:49:43.939
Oh, my.

681
00:49:44.019 --> 00:49:45.779
Sorry, Grim.

682
00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:50.299
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

683
00:49:50.379 --> 00:49:52.859
Ah, very amusing.

684
00:49:52.898 --> 00:49:55.061
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

685
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.580

Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh!

720
00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:09.876
I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.

721
00:52:11.836 --> 00:52:15.716
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

722
00:52:15.796 --> 00:52:18.278
- Louis!
- Ow.

723
00:52:18.358 --> 00:52:23.159
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...

724
00:52:23.239 --> 00:52:27.279
I'm sorry, madame.

725
00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:30.199
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

726
00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:32.718
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

727
00:52:32.798 --> 00:52:34.638
Something in the way of a tour.

728
00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:37.640
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

729
00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:40.681
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

730
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:42.842
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

731
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:44.761
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

732
00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:47.921
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

733
00:52:48.001 --> 00:52:49.320
Well, what do ya say?

734
00:52:49.402 --> 00:52:52.362
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

735
00:52:52.442 --> 00:52:57.362
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

736
00:53:05.164 --> 00:53:07.005
Come here, boy.

737
00:53:23.525 --> 00:53:26.527
This has got to be, without a doubt,

738
00:53:26.607 --> 00:53:30.927
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

739
00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:36.247
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

740
00:53:36.328 --> 00:53:40.207
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

741
00:53:40.287 --> 00:53:45.167
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

742
00:53:45.247 --> 00:53:49.569
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

743
00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:54.690
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

744
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.890
Hmm.

745
00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:09.372
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

746
00:54:09.452 --> 00:54:12.933
Completely hopeless.

747
00:54:21.093 --> 00:54:22.453
Any sign of them?

748
00:54:22.533 --> 00:54:25.492
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

749
00:54:25.573 --> 00:54:28.733
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

750
00:54:28.812 --> 00:54:32.894
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

751
00:54:32.934 --> 00:54:36.935
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

752
00:54:37.015 --> 00:54:38.935
Yes, sire.

753
00:54:40.136 --> 00:54:45.215
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

754
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.269
Has he kissed her yet?

755
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:11.670
- Not yet.
- Oh!

756
00:55:17.432 --> 00:55:19.353
Oh, Judy!

757
00:55:34.273 --> 00:55:36.795
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

758
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.235
No, not yet.

759
00:55:39.274 --> 00:55:41.634
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

760
00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:11.437
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

761
00:56:11.518 --> 00:56:13.117
I can't see a thing.

762
00:56:13.198 --> 00:56:16.237
Nothing is happening.

763
00:56:16.317 --> 00:56:21.360
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

764
00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:27.681
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

765
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.640
Stand back!

766
00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:35.762
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

767
00:56:35.841 --> 00:56:40.240
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

768
00:56:40.321 --> 00:56:42.321
Wa, wa, wa-wa!

769
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:45.283
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

770
00:56:45.323 --> 00:56:49.643
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.

771
00:56:49.723 --> 00:56:51.603
Wa, wa, wa, wa!

772
00:56:51.683 --> 00:56:55.283
You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.

773
00:56:55.363 --> 00:57:00.243

is one of flesh and blood,

Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...

863
01:04:13.218 --> 01:04:17.659
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror,

864
01:04:17.738 --> 01:04:21.258
and she was singin'
with a stolen set of pipes.

865
01:04:21.339 --> 01:04:23.979
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?

866
01:04:24.059 --> 01:04:29.181
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

867
01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:32.381
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

868
01:04:32.421 --> 01:04:34.340
I mean, when it's important?

869
01:04:34.421 --> 01:04:36.821
What are we gonna do?

870
01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:40.461
Before the sun
sets on the third day.

871
01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:42.821
Day...

872
01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:49.383
Ariel, grab onto that.

873
01:04:49.423 --> 01:04:53.104
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

874
01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:55.064
I'll try!

875
01:04:55.144 --> 01:04:57.624
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

876
01:04:57.704 --> 01:04:59.664
- What about me? What about me?
- You!

877
01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:02.984
Find a way to stall that wedding!

878
01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.904
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?

879
01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:07.585
What? That's it!

880
01:05:16.626 --> 01:05:18.106
Let's go!

881
01:05:18.186 --> 01:05:20.706
We got an emergency here.

882
01:05:32.227 --> 01:05:34.109
Dearly beloved...

883
01:05:34.189 --> 01:05:39.309
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

884
01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.229
We're almost there.

885
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:45.029
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

886
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.190
to be your lawfully wedded wife

887
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:50.749
for as long as you both shall live?

888
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:52.910
I do.

889
01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:54.912
It being... And do you...

890
01:06:03.632 --> 01:06:04.832
Oh!

891
01:06:06.833 --> 01:06:09.353
Oh! Oh! Oh!

892
01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.152
Then by the power...

893
01:06:14.192 --> 01:06:16.232
Get away, you slimy...

894
01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:17.835
Oh!

895
01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:23.635
Oh!

896
01:06:24.995 --> 01:06:28.755
Oh!

897
01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:31.195
Oh, why, you little...

898
01:06:42.358 --> 01:06:43.877
Huh?

899
01:06:51.198 --> 01:06:53.158
Ariel?

900
01:06:53.237 --> 01:06:56.318
Eric.

901
01:06:56.398 --> 01:06:58.398
You... You can talk?

902
01:06:58.478 --> 01:07:02.280
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

903
01:07:02.359 --> 01:07:05.961
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

904
01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.000
Eric, no!

905
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.880
You're too late!

906
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.441
You're too late!

907
01:07:20.961 --> 01:07:25.044
So long, lover boy.

908
01:07:25.123 --> 01:07:27.723
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

909
01:07:27.802 --> 01:07:30.603
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

910
01:07:30.683 --> 01:07:33.842
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

911
01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:39.004
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

912
01:07:39.044 --> 01:07:42.483
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

913
01:07:42.523 --> 01:07:45.606
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

914
01:07:45.685 --> 01:07:48.966
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

915
01:07:52.286 --> 01:07:53.526
You see?

916
01:07:53.566 --> 01:07:56.766
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

917
01:07:56.846 --> 01:07:58.767
even for you.

918
01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:04.087
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

919
01:08:04.127 --> 01:08:09.288
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

920
01:08:09.368 --> 01:08:13.368
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

921
01:08:13.448 --> 01:08:17.249
for someone even better.

922
01:08:17.289 --> 01:08:18.970
Eric, what are you doing?

923
01:08:19.049 --> 01:08:22.610
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

924
01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:27.089
Now, do we have a deal?

925
01:08:29.531 --> 01:08:32.491
Ha! It's done then!

926
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:37.372
No! Oh, no!

927
01:08:45.572 --> 01:08:47.612
Your Majesty.

928
01:08:47.651 --> 01:08:48.892
Daddy.

929
01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:53.254
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

930
01:08:55.374 --> 01:08:59.453
You!

931
01:08:59.534 --> 01:09:00.693
You monster!

932
01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:02.855
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

933
01:09:02.895 --> 01:09:05.736
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

934
01:09:05.775 --> 01:09:08.255
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

935
01:09:08.335 --> 01:09:10.214
After him!

936
01:09:16.537 --> 01:09:19.337
Come on!

937
01:09:19.377 --> 01:09:22.017
Ow!

938
01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:26.616
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

939
01:09:31.176 --> 01:09:35.699
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

940
01:09:45.299 --> 01:09:47.940
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

941
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.181
No, I won't leave you.

942
01:10:07.023 --> 01:10:11.703
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

943
01:10:11.782 --> 01:10:13.662
Look out!

944
01:10:15.342 --> 01:10:18.183
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

945
01:10:18.223 --> 01:10:21.705
The waves obey my every whim!

946
01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:25.705
Eric!

947
01:10:25.785 --> 01:10:31.266
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

948
01:10:49.268 --> 01:10:51.708
Eric!

949
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:15.231
Oh! Oh!

950
01:11:24.311 --> 01:11:27.273
So much for true love!

951
01:12:22.399 --> 01:12:26.279
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

952
01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:32.000
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

953
01:12:32.079 --> 01:12:36.842
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

954
01:12:36.921 --> 01:12:38.762
You always say that?

955
01:12:41.561 --> 01:12:45.682
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

956
01:12:45.763 --> 01:12:47.803
And what's that, Your Majesty?

957
01:12:47.843 --> 01:12:51.322
How much I'm going to miss her.

958
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:50.090
Ah-ha!

959
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:01.373
Yes!

960
01:14:01.453 --> 01:14:03.253
Thank you. Thank you.

961
01:14:12.813 --> 01:14:14.374
I love you, Daddy.
