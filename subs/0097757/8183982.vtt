Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

121
00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:23.003

And now look at me.

124
00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.987
Wasted away to practically nothing.

125
00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:38.118
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

126
00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:43.223

I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

132
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:10.617
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

133
00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:12.786
As a result of your careless behavior...

134
00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:14.693
Careless and reckless behavior!

135
00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:16.993
...the entire celebration was, uh...

136
00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:20.729
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

137
00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:22.964
This concert was to be

138
00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:26.633
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

139
00:12:26.709 --> 00:12:30.475
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

140
00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:32.138
But it wasn't her fault...

141
00:12:32.214 --> 00:12:35.877
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

142
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:39.443
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

143
00:12:39.522 --> 00:12:42.719
And... And we... Whoa!

144
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:44.725
And then we were safe.

145
00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:47.556
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

146
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:49.290
Seagull?

147
00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:52.094
What? Oh!

148
00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.260
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

149
00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:56.803
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

150
00:12:56.871 --> 00:13:01.103
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

151
00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:05.806
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

152
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.440
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

153
00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:12.509
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

154
00:13:12.587 --> 00:13:15.078
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

155
00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.852
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

156
00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:21.395
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

157
00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:24.330
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

158
00:13:24.398 --> 00:13:28.801
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

159
00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:30.860
Is that clear?

160
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.636
Hmph! Teenagers.

161
00:13:38.712 --> 00:13:41.010
They think they know everything.

162
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.744
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

163
00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:48.811
Do you think I was too hard on her?

164
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:51.016
Definitely not.

165
00:13:51.091 --> 00:13:56.154
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

166
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.824
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

167
00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:02.766
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

168
00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:05.599
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

169
00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:08.333
Ariel needs constant supervision.

170
00:14:08.407 --> 00:14:11.171
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

171
00:14:11.244 --> 00:14:12.336
All the time.

172
00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:15.073
And you are just the crab to do it.

173
00:14:16.415 --> 00:14:19.714
How do I get myself

Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

402
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.980
I've got an urgent message
from the sea King.

403
00:32:39.053 --> 00:32:41.214
The sea King?

404
00:32:41.288 --> 00:32:44.780
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

405
00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:47.520
He knows.

406
00:32:47.594 --> 00:32:50.495
Hey, let's see now.

407
00:32:50.564 --> 00:32:54.761
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

408
00:32:57.036 --> 00:33:01.837
Come in, Sebastian.

409
00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:05.071
I mustn't overreact.

410
00:33:05.144 --> 00:33:08.511
I must remain calm.

411
00:33:12.618 --> 00:33:16.247
Yes?

412
00:33:16.322 --> 00:33:19.314
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

413
00:33:19.392 --> 00:33:22.589
I'm concerned about Ariel.

414
00:33:22.662 --> 00:33:25.995
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

415
00:33:26.065 --> 00:33:31.058
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

416
00:33:31.136 --> 00:33:34.867
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

417
00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.999
You haven't noticed, hmm?

418
00:33:37.075 --> 00:33:39.908
Oh, well, I...

419
00:33:39.978 --> 00:33:43.379
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

420
00:33:44.416 --> 00:33:48.352
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

421
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.651
Keeping something?

422
00:33:51.723 --> 00:33:53.657
About Ariel?

423
00:33:56.795 --> 00:34:00.231
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

424
00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:05.826
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

425
00:34:05.903 --> 00:34:09.031
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

426
00:34:09.106 --> 00:34:13.839
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

427
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:17.472
Humans?

428
00:34:17.581 --> 00:34:22.285
Who said anything about humans?

429
00:34:22.286 --> 00:34:22.487
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

430
00:34:22.488 --> 00:34:26.753
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

431
00:34:26.824 --> 00:34:30.453
You'll see. It's a surprise.

432
00:34:30.528 --> 00:34:32.587
Oh, Flounder.

433
00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:36.656
Flounder, you're the best!

434
00:34:36.734 --> 00:34:41.295
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

435
00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:46.434
Why, Eric, run away with you?

436
00:34:46.509 --> 00:34:50.206
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

437
00:34:53.616 --> 00:34:55.550
Daddy?

438
00:34:58.955 --> 00:35:02.948
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

439
00:35:03.026 --> 00:35:07.986
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

440
00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.554
But, Dad, I...

441
00:35:09.632 --> 00:35:12.896
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

442
00:35:12.968 --> 00:35:13.957
I had to...

443
00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:17.631
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

444
00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:20.541
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

445
00:35:20.542 --> 00:35:24.069
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

446
00:35:24.146 --> 00:35:26.410
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

447
00:35:26.482 --> 00:35:29.576
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

448
00:35:29.651 --> 00:35:32.085
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

449
00:35:32.154 --> 00:35:33.587
incapable of any feeling...

450
00:35:33.655 --> 00:35:36.590
Daddy, I love him!

451
00:35:36.658 --> 00:35:40.924
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

452
00:35:40.996 --> 00:35:42.930
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

453
00:35:42.998 --> 00:35:44.488
I don't care.

454
00:35:44.566 --> 00:35:48.695
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

455
00:35:48.769 --> 00:35:52.637
And if this is the only way, so be it!

456
00:35:55.343 --> 00:35:58.210
Daddy! No!

457
00:35:58.279 --> 00:36:00.873
No! Please!

458
00:36:00.948 --> 00:36:04.645
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

459
00:36:07.388 --> 00:36:09.583
Daddy, no!

460
00:36:33.113 --> 00:36:35.047
Ariel, I...

461
00:36:35.115 --> 00:36:37.447
Just go away.

462
00:36:55.802 --> 00:37:01.398
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

463
00:37:01.473 --> 00:37:06.376
She has a very serious problem.

464
00:37:06.445 --> 00:37:09.778
If only there were
something we could do.

465
00:37:09.848 --> 00:37:12.783
But there is something.

466
00:37:12.851 --> 00:37:17.515
Who... Who are you?

467
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.820
Don't be scared.

468
00:37:19.892 --> 00:37:23.123
We represent someone who can help you.

469
00:37:23.195 --> 00:37:28.292
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

470
00:37:28.367 --> 00:37:30.392
Just imagine...

471
00:37:30.469 --> 00:37:32.460
You and your prince...

472
00:37:32.538 --> 00:37:36.064
Together forever.

473
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.074
I don't understand.

474
00:37:38.142 --> 00:37:43.978
Ursula has great powers.

475
00:37:44.048 --> 00:37:48.007
The sea witch?

476
00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:51.351
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

477
00:37:51.422 --> 00:37:54.482
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

478
00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:56.789
Suit yourself.

479
00:37:57.795 --> 00:38:01.094
It was only a suggestion.

480
00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:11.731
Wait.

481
00:38:11.808 --> 00:38:15.266
Yes?

482
00:38:15.345 --> 00:38:19.645
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

483
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.184
It was an accident.

484
00:38:22.185 --> 00:38:25.279
Ariel? Where are you going?

485
00:38:25.355 --> 00:38:27.983
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

486
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.958
I'm going to see Ursula.

487
00:38:30.027 --> 00:38:34.487
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

488
00:38:34.564 --> 00:38:37.863
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

489
00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:42.735
But... But, I... Come on!

490
00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.881
This way.

491
00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:22.038
Come in. Come in, my child.

492
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:27.343
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

493
00:39:27.415 --> 00:39:31.374
One might question
your upbringing.

494
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:35.954
Now, then, you're here

495
00:39:36.024 --> 00:39:40.984
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

496
00:39:41.062 --> 00:39:46.659
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

497
00:39:46.735 --> 00:39:49.260

501

536
00:41:52.556 --> 00:41:56.993
you've got to get dear old princie

00:41:57.061 --> 00:41:59.962
That is, he's got to kiss you.

Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

539
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:09.300
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

540
00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:13.366
you'll remain human permanently.

541

If I become human,

546
00:42:28.825 --> 00:42:31.589
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

547
00:42:31.661 --> 00:42:33.959

551

616
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:39.620

to give you back your voice,

617
00:47:39.693 --> 00:47:43.185
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...

618
00:47:43.263 --> 00:47:46.790
Just be...

619
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:52.100

Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

624
00:48:10.591 --> 00:48:14.673
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.

625
00:48:21.013 --> 00:48:24.710
Max? What?

626
00:48:24.783 --> 00:48:27.581

631

Quiet, Max.

632
00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:56.438
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

633
00:48:56.514 --> 00:49:00.143
Oh, I see.

634
00:49:00.218 --> 00:49:03.312

scared you.

637
00:49:09.994 --> 00:49:14.795
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

638
00:49:17.468 --> 00:49:19.299

639

640

What's your name?

641
00:49:24.141 --> 00:49:27.633
What's wrong? What is it?

642
00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:34.009
You can't speak? Oh!

643
00:49:34.084 --> 00:49:36.712
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

644
00:49:40.624 --> 00:49:44.583
What is it? You're hurt?

645
00:49:44.661 --> 00:49:47.323
No, no. You need help?

646
00:49:47.397 --> 00:49:50.025
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

647
00:49:51.301 --> 00:49:54.270
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

648
00:49:54.338 --> 00:49:56.465
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

649
00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.473
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.

650

653
00:50:18.427 --> 00:50:22.523

654
00:50:26.802 --> 00:50:29.066
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

655
00:50:29.138 --> 00:50:31.072
- No!
- Gertrude says...

656
00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.301
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

657
00:50:34.676 --> 00:50:36.610
- Really.
- Madam, please...

658
00:50:36.678 --> 00:50:40.114
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

659
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:42.274
If Eric's looking for a girl,

660
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.786
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.

661
00:50:58.066 --> 00:50:58.167
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

662
00:50:58.168 --> 00:51:00.499
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

663
00:51:00.568 --> 00:51:04.129
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people

664
00:51:04.205 --> 00:51:07.402
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...

665
00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:09.704
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

666
00:51:09.777 --> 00:51:13.110
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

667
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:17.446
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

668
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:26.949

669

It is rather a fine one.

675
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.564
Oh, my.

676
00:52:06.632 --> 00:52:08.463

677
00:52:08.534 --> 00:52:13.198
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

678
00:52:13.272 --> 00:52:15.832
Ah, very amusing.

679
00:52:15.908 --> 00:52:18.138
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

680
00:52:18.211 --> 00:52:19.735
Oh, you're gonna love it!

You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:10.802

It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

726

Well, what do ya say?

727
00:55:19.886 --> 00:55:22.980
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

728
00:55:23.056 --> 00:55:28.221
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

729
00:55:36.336 --> 00:55:38.270
Come here, boy.

730
00:55:55.487 --> 00:55:58.615
This has got to be, without a doubt,

731
00:55:58.691 --> 00:56:03.185
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

732
00:56:03.262 --> 00:56:08.757
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

733
00:56:08.834 --> 00:56:12.861
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

734
00:56:12.938 --> 00:56:18.035
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

735
00:56:18.143 --> 00:56:22.680
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

736
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:27.982
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

737
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:43.296
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

738
00:56:43.368 --> 00:56:46.997
Completely hopeless.

739
00:56:55.513 --> 00:56:56.912
Any sign of them?

740
00:56:56.981 --> 00:57:00.075
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

741
00:57:00.151 --> 00:57:03.483
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

742
00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:07.785
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

743
00:57:07.858 --> 00:57:12.022
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

744
00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.086
Yes, sire.

745
00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:20.667
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

746
00:57:45.053 --> 00:57:46.418
Has he kissed her yet?

747
00:57:46.488 --> 00:57:48.922
Not yet.

748
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:56.921
Oh, Judy!

749
00:58:12.514 --> 00:58:15.107
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

750
00:58:15.183 --> 00:58:17.651
No, not yet.

751
00:58:17.718 --> 00:58:20.152
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

752
00:58:48.883 --> 00:58:51.248
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

753
00:58:51.318 --> 00:58:53.013
I can't see a thing.

754
00:58:53.086 --> 00:58:56.249
Nothing is happening.

755
00:58:56.323 --> 00:59:01.590
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

756
00:59:01.661 --> 00:59:08.157
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

757
00:59:08.235 --> 00:59:11.261
Stand back!

758
00:59:11.338 --> 00:59:16.605
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

759
00:59:16.676 --> 00:59:21.272

The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...

851
01:07:03.396 --> 01:07:05.727
Ariel!

852
01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:08.892
Ariel!

853
01:07:08.968 --> 01:07:13.428
Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...

854
01:07:13.505 --> 01:07:18.169
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror,

855
01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:21.906
and she was singin'
with a stolen set of pipes.

856
01:07:21.981 --> 01:07:24.745
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?

857
01:07:24.817 --> 01:07:30.153
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

858
01:07:30.222 --> 01:07:33.487
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

859
01:07:33.559 --> 01:07:35.550
I mean, when it's important?

860
01:07:35.627 --> 01:07:38.118
What are we gonna do?

861
01:07:38.197 --> 01:07:41.927
<i>Before the sun</i>
<i>sets on the third day.</i>

862
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.366
<i>Day...</i>

863
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.208
Ariel, grab onto that.

864
01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:55.109
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

865
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:57.147
I'll try!

866
01:07:57.215 --> 01:07:59.809
I gotta get to the sea King.
He must know about this.

867
01:07:59.884 --> 01:08:01.943
- What about me? What about me?
- You!

868
01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:05.387
Find a way to stall that wedding!

869
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.390
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?

870
01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:10.222
What? That's it!

871
01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.160
Let's go!

872
01:08:21.238 --> 01:08:23.900
We got an emergency here.

873
01:08:35.886 --> 01:08:37.854
Dearly beloved...

874
01:08:37.921 --> 01:08:43.257
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

875
01:08:43.326 --> 01:08:45.260
We're almost there.

876
01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:49.230
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

877
01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:52.529
to be your lawfully wedded wife

878
01:08:52.601 --> 01:08:55.195
for as long as you both shall live?

879
01:08:55.271 --> 01:08:57.466
I do.

880
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.531
It being... And do you...

881
01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:19.593
Then by the power...

882
01:09:19.662 --> 01:09:21.755
Get away, you slimy...

883
01:09:34.909 --> 01:09:37.377
Oh, why, you little...

884
01:09:58.233 --> 01:10:00.258
Ariel?

885
01:10:00.335 --> 01:10:03.565
Eric.

886
01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:05.730
You... You can talk?

887
01:10:05.806 --> 01:10:09.765
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

888
01:10:09.843 --> 01:10:13.609
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

889
01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.810
Eric, no!

890
01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:20.820
You're too late!

891
01:10:20.888 --> 01:10:23.516
You're too late!

892
01:10:29.263 --> 01:10:33.529
So long, lover boy.

893
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.296
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

894
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.304
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

895
01:10:39.372 --> 01:10:42.671
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

896
01:10:42.742 --> 01:10:48.044
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

897
01:10:48.114 --> 01:10:51.675
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

898
01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:54.948
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

899
01:10:55.021 --> 01:10:58.457
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

900
01:11:01.894 --> 01:11:03.191
You see?

901
01:11:03.262 --> 01:11:06.595
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

902
01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.657
even for you.

903
01:11:08.734 --> 01:11:14.194
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

904
01:11:14.272 --> 01:11:19.642
The daughter of the great sea King
is a very precious commodity.

905
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:23.909
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

906
01:11:23.982 --> 01:11:27.918
for someone even better.

907
01:11:27.986 --> 01:11:29.749
Eric, what are you doing?

908
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:33.518
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

909
01:11:33.592 --> 01:11:38.188
Now, do we have a deal?

910
01:11:40.732 --> 01:11:43.826
Ha! It's done then!

911
01:11:45.804 --> 01:11:48.931
No! Oh, no!

912
01:11:57.448 --> 01:11:59.575
Your Majesty.

913
01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:00.912
Daddy.

914
01:12:00.985 --> 01:12:05.479
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

915
01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:11.957
You!

916
01:12:12.029 --> 01:12:13.223
You monster!

917
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.531
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

918
01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:18.467
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

919
01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:21.129
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

920
01:12:21.205 --> 01:12:23.139
After him!

921
01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:32.647
Come on!

922
01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:40.252
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

923
01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:49.727
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

924
01:12:59.741 --> 01:13:02.505
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

925
01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:04.841
No, I won't leave you.

926
01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:27.266
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

927
01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.304
Look out!

928
01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:34.008
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

929
01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:37.704
The waves obey my every whim!

930
01:13:37.778 --> 01:13:41.874
Eric!

931
01:13:41.949 --> 01:13:47.649
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

932
01:14:06.407 --> 01:14:08.967
Eric!

933
01:14:42.942 --> 01:14:46.035
So much for true love!

934
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:47.562
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

935
01:15:47.638 --> 01:15:53.543
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

936
01:15:53.611 --> 01:15:58.570
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

937
01:15:58.648 --> 01:16:00.582
You always say that?

938
01:16:03.487 --> 01:16:07.787
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

939
01:16:07.858 --> 01:16:09.985
And what's that, Your Majesty?

940
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.689
How much I'm going to miss her.

941
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:26.691
Yes!

942
01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.668
Thank you. Thank you.

943
01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:40.274
I love you, Daddy.
