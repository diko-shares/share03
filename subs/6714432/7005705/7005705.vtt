00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:48.166
<i>Woke up just like any morning</i>

2
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.000
<i>New day, same sunlight pouring down</i>

3
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.750
<i>Danced on to the beat I'm drumming</i>

4
00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:01.000
<i>High hopes pulled my feet
off the ground</i>

5
00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.250
<i>Heart stopped, didn't see you coming</i>

6
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.291
<i>Felt like you took my breath away</i>

7
00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.875
<i>I knew this was the start of something</i>

8
00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.208
<i>And I think I knew you felt the same</i>

9
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.083
<i>Time frozen, eyes opened</i>

10
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.000
<i>Spun my world around in motion</i>

11
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.583
<i>Just a step away</i>

12
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.916
<i>Just a slip of fate</i>

13
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.791
<i>Oh, you never know
how one simple interaction</i>

14
00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:41.916
<i>Can lead you down a road
where anything can always happen</i>

15
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.291
<i>The picture in our mind
changes over time</i>

16
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.625
<i>Bigger than what we imagined</i>

17
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.166
<i>We wouldn't change
a thing about it now</i>

18
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.166
<i>Life is better loud</i>

19
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.750
<i>Ain't no stopping now</i>

20
00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:28.000
<i>Life is better loud</i>

21
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:32.875
<i>Oh, it feels like home
no matter where we are together</i>

22
00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:39.250
<i>Wish we'd always known
a bigger crowd was always better</i>

23
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:43.500
<i>We wouldn't change
a thing about it now</i>

24
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.333
<i>Life is better loud</i>

25
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.916
<i>Loud house</i>

26
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.250
<i>Loud house</i>

27
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.458
<i>Life is better loud</i>

28
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.791
<i>In the loud house, the loud house</i>

29
00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.416
<i>Loud house!</i>

30
00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.833
Movie!

31
00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:08.125
Okay, Lily, I didn't wake you up
at 6:00 in the morning just to play.

32
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.625
It's time for another lesson
on how to survive in a big family.

33
00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:12.541
Poo-poo.

34
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.708
Lesson number 374,
Breakfast Burrito Saturday.

35
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:18.250
Bawitotos!

36
00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.541
Now that you have teeth,

37
00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.750
you'll want one of Dad's famous
breakfast burritos all to yourself.

38
00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.500
- Lily!
- Just like your sisters.

39
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.416
Sisters.

40
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.000
Which means it's you against them
at the table.

41
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.708
Don't worry!

42
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:38.541
Because your big brother
is the man with the plan.

43
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:40.375
Patent pending.

44
00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:41.541
And today's plan

45
00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:44.541
is to get to those burritos
before our sisters wake up.

46
00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:48.750
I can smell them now.
Okay, Lily, it's go-time.

47
00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:52.666
Poo-poo.

48
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:56.583
So all you need to do
is just watch and learn

49
00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.833
because around here,
no one outsmarts Lincoln...

50
00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:00.791
Loud.

51
00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.041
Nice try, Lincoln.

52
00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:05.958
You're not the only one who remembered
it's burritos Saturday.

53
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.750
Yay! Burritos!

54
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:10.750
Lincoln!

55
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.166
The key is to having a plan
is to always have a backup plan.

56
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.333
Backup plan.

57
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:18.583
Hot burritos!

58
00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:21.791
Hot, hot burritos, hey!
Do little a dance and move your feet-os!

59
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.166
Hey! Morning, Lincoln! Hello, Lily.

60
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.166
Bawitoto.

61
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.166
That's right, sweetie. Bawitotos.

62
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.541
Hey, where're your sisters?
I thought I heard them.

63
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.750
Did you?

64
00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:41.708
Burritos!

65
00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.541
Sorry, Lily.
So much for watching and learning.

66
00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.458
Backup plan.

67
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:51.000
The student has become the master.

68
00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:58.666
Lola, we need to go
to make it to your recital on time.

69
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.625
- Don't forget my science fair.
- I have the Junior Morticians Death Match.

70
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.875
I'm working pit crew at the race track!

71
00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.041
Soccer playoff.

72
00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.291
- Joke-A-Palooza!
- Don't forget my shred-off.

73
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.916
You all have activities today?

74
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.083
Not me.

75
00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:13.750
I just have my fashion show.

76
00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:15.583
That's an activity, honey!

77
00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:18.416
We're not prepared for this!
This is a ding dang disaster!

78
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.333
What do we do?
Don't panic! Don't panic!

79
00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:24.375
Don't panic!

80
00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:27.916
Relax, everybody. I got this.

81
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:30.166
Another lesson, Lily.

82
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.250
It's always more important
to help your family than outsmart them.

83
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.041
All right, Louds. Let's go, go, go!

84
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:36.666
- Lori, golf clubs.
- Thanks.

85
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.125
- Leni, measuring tape.
- Thanks.

86
00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:39.458
- Luna, guitar.
- Thanks!

87
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:40.708
- Lynn, soccer ball.
- Yeah!

88
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:42.041
Luan, rubber chicken.

89
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.541
- Lucy, black veil.
- Thanks.

90
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:45.583
- Lola, flaming baton.
- Thanks.

91
00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.208
- Lana, wrench set.
- Thanks, Linc.

92
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:50.791
- Lisa, ammonium di...
- Dichromate! Thank you, male sibling.

93
00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:53.708
- All right, we got everything?
- Yup, we're good to go.

94
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.375
Mom, Dad, you forgot something!

95
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.333
Oh, sorry, sweetie.

96
00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.416
Okay, where to first?

97
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.291
- Race track.
- Soccer field.

98
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:08.291
Dad, Lori's first. Take a right.

99
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.708
- Go, Lori!
- Hole in one!

100
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.083
Hole in one!

101
00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.458
Can someone please hold this for a minute?

102
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.666
I got it.

103
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.583
Leni's next.

104
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.708
Go left. I know a shortcut.

105
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.541
Amazing!

106
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:35.375
Gotta go!

107
00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.791
- Who's next?
- It's Luna time.

108
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:42.708
Go, Luna!

109
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.208
Yeah, Luna!

110
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.625
Thanks, bro.

111
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.125
Go, go, go!

112
00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:56.125
Why did the chicken cross the playground?

113
00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:58.916
To get to the other slide!

114
00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:05.041
- Hey, Lincoln.
- I got it.

115
00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.291
She shoots...

116
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.750
She scores!

117
00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.541
Lincoln, catch.

118
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.958
Oof! Got it. Dang it.

119
00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:20.791
Lincoln.

120
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.541
You're next, Lola.

121
00:07:27.916 --> 00:07:29.666
Hands off.

122
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.166
Come on, we gotta get to Lana's race.

123
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.625
Lincoln will hold it.

124
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.583
Lisa, you're up.

125
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.583
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

126
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:54.708
<i>We are the Louds!
Loud and proud!</i>

127
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.083
<i>We are the Louds!
Loud and proud!</i>

128
00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:58.916
<i>We are the Louds!</i>

129
00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:03.083
We did it. Thank you, Lincoln.

130
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.333
You sure know how to keep
the old Loud fam' running smoothly, kiddo.

131
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.416
<i>We are the Louds!
Loud and proud!</i>

132
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.666
<i>We are the Louds!</i>

133
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.958
Yeah, Loud and too loud!

134
00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:18.583
Let's get a pic of the kids
for our Loud Wall of Fame.

135
00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:21.250
Oh, great idea!
Everyone, hold up your trophies!

136
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.000
- Get my good side.
- I only have good sides.

137
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.250
- Yeah.
- Not sure I'll show up, but...

138
00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:28.750
- Get my funny side.
- Hey! Watch out!

139
00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.583
Okay, everyone, squeeze in.

140
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:33.416
Sisters!

141
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.333
Hey. Guys, wait for me.

142
00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:38.833
- Look, it's the Loud sisters!
- Nobody tosses a baton like that one.

143
00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:41.666
She embalmed my Uncle Jack!

144
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.833
I wish my family
was as talented as they are.

145
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.166
- Selfie!
- Can I get an autograph?

146
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.708
Enough loudness. Scoots out.

147
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:55.375
Hey! You gotta pay
to ride this hog, sonny.

148
00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:59.500
Wait! Hey? Hey, guys?
I want to be in the photo.

149
00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.083
Oh, you just must be
so proud of your girls.

150
00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.458
- You're ding dang darn tootin'.
- They are very special.

151
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:17.375
No trophy, no photo.

152
00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:18.708
Loser!

153
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:23.041
- Guess! I'm gonna be in the newspaper!
- That lady wants to interview us on TV!

154
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.000
- Most likes ever.
- Me too.

155
00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:27.458
- How cool is that?
- Yeah!

156
00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:30.625
Let's go home
and put these trophies on display!

157
00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:34.000
I wish everyone thought
I was special.

158
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.958
<i>They say it doesn't matter</i>

159
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:39.541
<i>How you look or where you've been</i>

160
00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.833
<i>So why do I need a thousand likes</i>

161
00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:44.083
<i>To feel like I fit in?</i>

162
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.625
<i>I'd probably have it easy</i>

163
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:49.708
<i>If I were the only kid</i>

164
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:52.375
<i>But when you live with ten superstars</i>

165
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.333
<i>It's hard for you to win</i>

166
00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:57.750
<i>I wish I could be</i>

167
00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:00.083
<i>Someone extraordinary</i>

168
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.541
<i>But I'm just me</i>

169
00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:05.166
<i>And that's too ordinary</i>

170
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:10.833
<i>Is there ever gonna be
a place in the spotlight just for me?</i>

171
00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:16.333
<i>When the world can finally see
I'm special like my family</i>

172
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:18.250
<i>Will there be a time</i>

173
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.541
<i>When I really shine?</i>

174
00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.375
<i>Am I always gonna be</i>

175
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:26.416
<i>Plain old ordinary me?</i>

176
00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.500
<i>Plain old ordinary me?</i>

177
00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.916
<i>Am I always gonna be</i>

178
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.625
<i>Plain old, regular, boring</i>

179
00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:42.333
<i>Unremarkable, ordinary me?</i>

180
00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:46.125
Ordinary? You're talking crazy.

181
00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:48.708
You're just saying that
because you're my best friend.

182
00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:51.125
Name one thing that makes me special.

183
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:54.750
How about three? You've read
every single Ace Savvy comic twice,

184
00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:58.458
you're the fifth-best junior magician
in Royal Woods,

185
00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:00.833
and that history report you wrote?

186
00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:04.750
It was like I was at the signing
of the Declaration of Independence!

187
00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.041
And you can sing! That's four!

188
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.750
Anyone can do those things.

189
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:14.375
Admit it, Clyde. I'm always going
to be stuck in my sisters' shadows.

190
00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.750
I know exactly what'll cheer you up.

191
00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:19.500
My homemade cream puffs!

192
00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.916
Or, as I like to call them, dream puffs.

193
00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:33.291
What... What is it?

194
00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:35.416
Too much cinnamon?
Not enough cinnamon?

195
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.458
Actually, the recipe doesn't call
for cinnamon but I can add it...

196
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.500
No, Clyde, it's the best!

197
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:47.416
It's just that you, my sisters,
everyone is good at something.

198
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Except me.

199
00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:52.125
Nice one, Clyde.
You just made it worse.

200
00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.375
Well, I'm not that good at baking.

201
00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:57.291
Then how do you explain this?

202
00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:00.208
I'm just lucky.

203
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.125
- Baking runs in my family.
- What do you mean?

204
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.541
Remember when I took that trip
to France with my Nana Gayle?

205
00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.375
That's where I met my great-Nana May,

206
00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.458
- who owns a bakery in Paris.
- Bonjour.

207
00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:14.000
She told me about
my great-great-Nana Collette,

208
00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:16.375
- who ran a crepe shop in Calais.
- Bonjour.

209
00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:20.250
And my great-great-great-great-great-Nana
Helene, who baked for French royal family.

210
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.875
Enchanté.

211
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.041
When I got home,
Nana Gayle showed me their recipe books

212
00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:27.041
and I made cream puffs.

213
00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:29.333
She said baking was in my genes,

214
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.375
just like Nana May,
Nana Colette, and Nana Helene.

215
00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:35.666
Sorry, was that confusing?

216
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.291
- It was a lot of nanas.
- No!

217
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:39.500
You just gave me an awesome idea!

218
00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:42.000
You're the best best friend ever!

219
00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:53.333
Hey, kiddos, it's late.
Time to get ready for bed.

220
00:12:53.416 --> 00:12:56.250
Last one has to take out the garbage...

221
00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.333
for the rest of the month.

222
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.125
A superb time to evacuate the premises.

223
00:13:05.208 --> 00:13:07.375
- I get the mirror first!
- Not happening, dude!

224
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.625
You can't brush me off.

225
00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:12.083
Quickly, let's skedaddle!

226
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:17.500
I'm literally trying
to brush my teeth here.

227
00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:18.625
We all are, honey.

228
00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:21.458
I'm trying to brush my hair
and you made me lose count.

229
00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:24.458
Well, I'm plucking nose hairs
and I lost count too!

230
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:26.500
Mom! Dad!

231
00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:29.041
Lincoln has
to take out the trash for a month!

232
00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:31.791
I don't care. What part
of the world are we from?

233
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:35.416
- Who spit toothpaste on my arm?
- Clyde's family's from France.

234
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.208
Well, my family is from right here
in Royal Woods, honey.

235
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.875
I'm not sure where my family is
from originally. Why?

236
00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.750
If we knew, we could take
a vacation and meet our relatives.

237
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.166
- Vacation!
- Five-star hotel, please.

238
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.041
All we need to do is find out
where Dad's family is from.

239
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.583
- Okay, let's just slow down, everyone.
- Well, it can't hurt to find out.

240
00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:59.166
All I will need, Father, is a DNA sample.

241
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.083
No needles. I hate needles!

242
00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.833
Pshaw. Oh, Father.
Needles are for amateurs.

243
00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:18.916
I shoulda... picked the... needles!

244
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.000
Boy, I'm glad I know where I'm from.

245
00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:28.000
Please don't!

246
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.708
You couldn't have just
made him spit in a cup?

247
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.916
There's a scientific word for that.

248
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.125
Boring.

249
00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.166
- Dad?
- No more tickles!

250
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.958
- There, there.
- Is it over?

251
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:50.833
Indeed. My test has determined
that we hail from a land

252
00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.458
the Romans called...

253
00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.958
Caledonia.

254
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:57.291
Just give us the street name, Lis.

255
00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.416
Street name, Scotland.

256
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.750
What?

257
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.375
- Scotland?
- We have family in Scotland?

258
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:06.041
- Cool.
- So exotic.

259
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:07.458
So international.

260
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:11.291
So expensive!
Thirteen of us traveling all that way?

261
00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:14.583
I know, but we always do find a way
to make vacations work.

262
00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:19.333
- And the kids always have so much fun.
- Please! Can we, please?

263
00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:21.375
Prove your love to us.

264
00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:24.333
Scotland, here we come.

265
00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:26.125
Yeah!

266
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:30.291
Let's check the old vacay coin jar!
This is just what we've been saving for.

267
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:36.583
Where'd all the coins go?

268
00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:43.375
What? This winning smile
doesn't whiten itself, you know.

269
00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:47.791
No bucks, no luck, dudes.

270
00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:49.250
Really?

271
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.916
Mom, Dad, we can make this work!
Trust me.

272
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.500
We just gotta be...

273
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.125
a little adventurous.

274
00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:00.875
<i>I packed up all my things,
now there's no looking back</i>

275
00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.208
<i>I'm gonna leave it all behind</i>

276
00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:09.000
<i>We might not get tomorrow
but we got today</i>

277
00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:13.375
<i>We've got no time to waste
'cause it's now or never</i>

278
00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.041
<i>Now, now</i>

279
00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:17.166
<i>It's now, it's now</i>

280
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.250
<i>It's now, now</i>

281
00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.458
<i>It's now or never</i>

282
00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:23.125
<i>Now, now</i>

283
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.125
<i>It's now, it's now</i>

284
00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:29.791
<i>It's now, now,
it's now or never</i>

285
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
<i>It's now or never</i>

286
00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.125
<i>I wanna see the world</i>

287
00:16:42.208 --> 00:16:44.000
<i>Wanna do something new</i>

288
00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.666
<i>And who knows what we're gonna find?</i>

289
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.958
<i>It's now or never</i>

290
00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:51.583
<i>Now, now</i>

291
00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:53.666
<i>It's now, it's now</i>

292
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.458
<i>It's now, now</i>

293
00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:57.666
<i>It's now or never</i>

294
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.375
<i>Now, now</i>

295
00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:01.416
<i>It's now, it's now</i>

296
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.875
<i>It's now, now</i>

297
00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:05.875
<i>It's now or never</i>

298
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:16.083
Loud family, welcome to Scotland.

299
00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:20.208
- You did it, Stinkin.
- Way to go, bro.

300
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:23.458
- Lincoln, you're the man.
- Totes awesome.

301
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.625
- This is great, Lincoln.
- Scotland!

302
00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:28.416
It's like something
out of a fairy tale.

303
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.875
- I can't wait to meet our relatives.
- Amazing.

304
00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.500
I don't see a mall,
but it's still totes pretty.

305
00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:42.458
It's so wonderful, I don't even mind
seeing it in the sunshine.

306
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.208
Time fer
a wee dauber doon yonder.

307
00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:50.375
- An accent already, Dad? Really?
- At least he's not wearing a kilt.

308
00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:53.000
- Oh, yeah? Check it out.
- My eyes!

309
00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:54.583
Sweet knees, Pops.

310
00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:57.250
Bobby's not gonna believe I'm here.

311
00:17:58.625 --> 00:17:59.750
Boo Boo Bear.

312
00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:02.333
Boo Boo Bear. Boo Boo Bear.
Boo Boo Bear...

313
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.166
- Owie!
- Boo Boo Bear.

314
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.583
Babe. I miss you so much!

315
00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:07.958
Oh, Boo Boo Bear.

316
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:09.250
I hope you got my texts!

317
00:18:09.333 --> 00:18:12.041
I sent one every hour
on the hour just like you asked.

318
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:15.083
- How's the vacay?
- It's amazing here.

319
00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:17.708
What? Oh, I lost you there for a sec.

320
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:21.291
- I was saying how much I love Scotland.
- Babe.

321
00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:23.666
Wait. You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

322
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.000
Babe, I can't hear you.

323
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.541
- I love Scot...
- Babe.

324
00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:28.750
Breaking up... you.

325
00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.291
Wait. What?

326
00:18:30.416 --> 00:18:32.583
Breaking up... you.

327
00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:34.666
Stupid phone.

328
00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:39.125
Did Lori just break up with you?

329
00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:41.250
She said she's in love with
some other guy!

330
00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:42.583
Don't just stand there!

331
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.875
You can't let some other guy
be her Boo Boo Bear!

332
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:49.750
Heck no, I can't! There's only one
Boo Boo Bear and that's me!

333
00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:51.708
Looks like I'm going to Scotland!

334
00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:55.000
Wait!

335
00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:58.500
What was I thinking?
You can't ride a bike to Scotland...

336
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.041
without a helmet.

337
00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:06.500
Okay, everyone.
So what do you say we meet some Louds?

338
00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:07.875
Yes! Yeah!

339
00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:11.333
Let's ask that fisherman
where we can find them.

340
00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:12.833
- Yes!
- Yeah!

341
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.541
Excuse me. We've traveled halfway
around the world to meet our relatives.

342
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:22.666
- We're the Louds! Do you know where...
- Louds? Louds!

343
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.666
Louds! Louds!

344
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.375
Louds! Louds!

345
00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:31.708
- Think he's coming back?
- Don't worry, everyone.

346
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:34.500
I bet there are Louds this way.
Follow me.

347
00:19:34.583 --> 00:19:35.541
Let's do this!

348
00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:37.750
Oh, yeah!

349
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:38.916
Whoa, cool!

350
00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.291
What the sheep?

351
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:47.250
Quaint yet illogical.
Just like that door over there.

352
00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:50.333
Have a lovely day, my dear.

353
00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:55.416
- Watch your step, Mrs. Turnberry.
- Thank you, Angus.

354
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.208
Someday, someone will help us
fix this silly town.

355
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.833
One can only hope, ma'am.

356
00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:02.666
Looks like someone failed Door-Making 101.

357
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.291
Hey, I bet those signs will tell us
where to look!

358
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.208
Or not.

359
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:11.041
Someone failed Sign Making 101 too.

360
00:20:11.666 --> 00:20:14.208
How do I get out of here?

361
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:15.750
Dudes, look at that!

362
00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:19.250
It's nine o'clock and all is well.

363
00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.833
Never seen that before.

364
00:20:21.916 --> 00:20:24.500
Rita! They have a fish shop
and a chip shop.

365
00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:26.791
- The fish goes on chips!
- No, the chips on fish!

366
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:28.250
Nobody likes cold fish.

367
00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.833
- You're a cold fish!
- Well, you married me, didn't you?

368
00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.791
This place is crazy town.

369
00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:34.208
Talk about bonkers.

370
00:20:34.291 --> 00:20:35.791
Who's running this show?

371
00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:39.375
Have a nice day, Scott!
Hi, Scott! Hey, Scott!

372
00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:44.291
- Why are you calling everyone Scott?
- We're in Scott Land? Duh.

373
00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:46.791
What's up, Scott? You must be...

374
00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:50.208
Scott.

375
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.916
Yeah. How did you know that?

376
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:56.166
Leni?

377
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.750
Bye, Scott from Scott Land.

378
00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.875
That was Scott.

379
00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.250
Could it be?

380
00:21:03.708 --> 00:21:07.583
Hey, Angus, you're not going
to believe who's here. Look!

381
00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.833
Are those the Louds?

382
00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:12.291
Well, blow my bagpipes!

383
00:21:14.458 --> 00:21:15.583
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

384
00:21:15.666 --> 00:21:17.208
Everyone is so friendly.

385
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:19.875
Pardon me. Are you really Louds?

386
00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:23.458
Yes! We sure are!

387
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:27.541
Then welcome to Loch Loud!

388
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:31.333
- Loch Loud?
- That's right, lad!

389
00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.291
This town was founded by your ancestors!

390
00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:39.083
<i>You see, about 400 years ago
our village rose to fame</i>

391
00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:42.791
<i>By a family who founded all
I believe you know the name</i>

392
00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:46.583
<i>But we lost our leaders, lost our way,
we've never been the same</i>

393
00:21:46.666 --> 00:21:50.541
<i>That family's name was Loud
and now you've come home again!</i>

394
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:54.208
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

395
00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:58.500
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

396
00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:02.375
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

397
00:22:02.458 --> 00:22:06.166
<i>It's hard to believe, crazy but true,
this town is named for you</i>

398
00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:12.083
<i>And 400 years we've waited
with a hope as strong as stone</i>

399
00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:15.916
<i>For the Louds to come back home again,
we've yearned</i>

400
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.458
<i>In this glorious castle on the hill,
we've been awaiting you</i>

401
00:22:20.541 --> 00:22:25.958
<i>My Louds, at last you've returned</i>

402
00:22:26.041 --> 00:22:26.875
<i>Come on!</i>

403
00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:37.833
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

404
00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:41.458
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

405
00:22:41.541 --> 00:22:45.458
<i>This town is named for you, yes,
this town is named for you</i>

406
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:49.541
<i>It's hard to believe, crazy but true,
this town is named for you</i>

407
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:57.000
<i>This town is named for you</i>

408
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.333
For You is a weird name for a town.

409
00:23:01.416 --> 00:23:03.583
I'm sorry, but who are you?

410
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.125
Forgive me! I'm Angus,
the groundskeeper here at Loud Castle.

411
00:23:09.208 --> 00:23:12.916
And I welcome you to your ancestral home!

412
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:16.666
- Sweet!
- So fancy.

413
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.500
- This is more like it.
- Wowie, wow.

414
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:22.291
I can't believe Louds lived here.

415
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:25.083
We could fit 100 of our houses in here.

416
00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:33.083
Oh me, oh my!

417
00:23:33.708 --> 00:23:37.916
Do my eyes deceive me?
Why, you're...

418
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.125
Louds!

419
00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:44.208
Yes, I heard the song, Angus.
Everyone in Scotland heard the song.

420
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:49.166
Our dreams have come true, Morag!
Louds are back after 400 years.

421
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.791
Oh, my!

422
00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:53.750
Put me down!

423
00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.875
Sorry. Sorry.

424
00:23:55.958 --> 00:24:00.541
Loud family, may I introduce Morag,
the castle caretaker.

425
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:03.833
Would you care to take my bag?

426
00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:06.125
Lola! Sorry.

427
00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:10.000
I can barely believe Louds have returned
to their rightful place.

428
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.625
Well, for a week.

429
00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:14.541
A week? Not forevermore?

430
00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:16.375
Oh, let's not pry, Angus.

431
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:19.125
The family is only here on holiday.

432
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.416
Yes, well, I do hope you enjoy your visit.

433
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.958
You'll find lovely accommodations
in the village.

434
00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:27.166
Or they could stay here!
It's their family's castle after all.

435
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.500
- You mean it?
- We can stay?

436
00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:29.750
Yes!

437
00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:33.250
What a marvelous idea.

438
00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:37.875
- I've never been so excited.
- Can we call you Aunty Morag?

439
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.958
Oi! Hands off the antiques.

440
00:24:42.791 --> 00:24:45.083
- Oh, my.
- It was like that already.

441
00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:49.458
That one's on me.

442
00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:53.166
Mr. Angus, sir,
what can you tell us about our ancestors?

443
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.625
A grander clan
this land has never seen!

444
00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.166
No way!

445
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.625
Am I experiencing double vision?

446
00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:04.583
It's old-timey us!

447
00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:06.625
When did we pose for this?

448
00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:10.375
Ten girls and one boy.
Literally just like us.

449
00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:11.500
That's amazing.

450
00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:12.500
Yes!

451
00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:14.375
Yeah. How about that?

452
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:18.625
Just a week. Only for a week.

453
00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:21.041
Would you fancy a look
at the rest of the castle?

454
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:21.958
Yes!

455
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:24.791
Last one to their room
is a Scotch egg. Get it?

456
00:25:24.875 --> 00:25:26.666
- No, I don't.
- No touching!

457
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.333
It's just impossible to find
good help these days.

458
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:36.791
No roughhousing. Hey, you!
Hey, hands off the tapestries. Tapestries!

459
00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:41.958
So, let me guess.
The sisters were all special, right?

460
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.708
Oh, aye! All were exceptional.

461
00:25:44.791 --> 00:25:48.875
Our loch has never seen anything
quite like the Loud lassies!

462
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:50.458
Of course.

463
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.583
But there was also...

464
00:25:52.666 --> 00:25:53.750
- Stinkin!
- Lincoln!

465
00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:55.541
- Come here.
- Hurry!

466
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.625
- Chop, chop!
- Sorry, Angus, I gotta go.

467
00:25:57.708 --> 00:25:58.833
What? What is it?

468
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:00.416
You have to see this.

469
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:03.541
Look at this!

470
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.250
We all get our own rooms!

471
00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:08.000
Lincoln, come look.

472
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:10.083
I can jam in peace.

473
00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:11.875
Cool.

474
00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:14.083
I can rest in peace.

475
00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:15.000
Spooky.

476
00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:19.791
No more tea parties
ruined by Lana's burping.

477
00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:21.291
Wanna bet?

478
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.083
My room has a hot tub.

479
00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:27.291
Yeah, I noticed.

480
00:26:29.416 --> 00:26:31.750
I've found my happy place.

481
00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:33.416
Boom-boom!

482
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.416
Mine has a fashion runway!

483
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.625
Styling!

484
00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:40.000
Mine is big enough to be a comedy club.

485
00:26:40.083 --> 00:26:42.416
We each have our own bathroom!

486
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.458
What?

487
00:26:43.541 --> 00:26:46.000
I'm gonna take like 100 leaks a day.

488
00:26:48.166 --> 00:26:50.333
Ah, there you are, lad.

489
00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:53.958
Before you were whisked away,
I tried to tell you

490
00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:58.083
that the most special
of all your ancestors was the duke.

491
00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.375
The duke?

492
00:26:59.458 --> 00:27:03.541
Aye. And don't you know,
you'll be staying in his room.

493
00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:15.041
Wait. The boy in the painting
was the duke?

494
00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:17.041
- Aye.
- Hang on.

495
00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:20.125
The boy in the painting
with the white hair was the duke?

496
00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:21.083
Aye.

497
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:24.541
The boy in the painting
with the white hair that had ten sisters

498
00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:26.916
and looked just like me was the duke?

499
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
The one and only!

500
00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:30.583
He was the most special Loud
there ever was.

501
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:31.708
Yes!

502
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:35.250
Far and wide people knew his name.

503
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:38.916
His deeds were noble.
His heart was stout!

504
00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:41.833
Sweet digs, Stinkin.

505
00:27:41.916 --> 00:27:44.083
The boy was the duke!

506
00:27:44.166 --> 00:27:46.333
Whatever tugs your tonsils, bro.

507
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:49.041
Hey, Angus, what's the deal
with all the dragon stuff?

508
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.125
Ah, so you noticed!

509
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:53.916
If it's dragons you fancy,
there's something you should see.

510
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.625
Come with me.

511
00:28:03.791 --> 00:28:08.583
The reason why dragons are celebrated here
is that they are a part of our history.

512
00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:11.041
I knew it! Dragons are for reals.

513
00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:13.166
Sounds like hooey to me!

514
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.541
Oh, they're as real
as the tartan in my kilt.

515
00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:19.750
In fact, your ancestors
had their very own dragon.

516
00:28:19.833 --> 00:28:22.333
And when the family left, so did she.

517
00:28:26.708 --> 00:28:28.791
Whoa, a dragon cave!

518
00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:30.000
Keep dreaming.

519
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:31.791
If it's proof you need,

520
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:35.666
take a gander at what
your ancestors' dragon left behind.

521
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.708
Oh, man. I told you!

522
00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:40.291
This is wack-a-doodle!

523
00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:43.458
Miss Lynn, if you wouldn't mind
taking Miss Lily for a moment.

524
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:47.166
Just as we hoped
that someday Louds would return,

525
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.125
we hoped a dragon would too.

526
00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.833
It's hatched!

527
00:28:52.916 --> 00:28:55.083
You mean there's a dragon
on the loose in here?

528
00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.458
No sudden movements.

529
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:00.250
Easy does it. Remain calm!

530
00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:01.250
Angus!

531
00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:03.125
Run for your lives!

532
00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:09.208
- Aw, so cute.
- Puppy dragon.

533
00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:11.208
Look at that little face.

534
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:14.000
We gotta name this little pup.

535
00:29:15.416 --> 00:29:16.666
Lela.

536
00:29:17.416 --> 00:29:19.166
Her name is Lela.

537
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.625
I love her so much.

538
00:29:20.708 --> 00:29:21.833
She's so cute.

539
00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.666
Biologically improbable yet so adorable.

540
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.291
Can we keep her?

541
00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:29.375
Okay.
But I am not changing her diaper.

542
00:29:29.458 --> 00:29:30.875
- Yes!
- Thanks, Mom.

543
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.125
Dude, pick a key.

544
00:29:42.291 --> 00:29:44.375
What are you doing, honey?

545
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:46.166
Duke-ing.

546
00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:47.583
Right in front of us?

547
00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:50.000
You know we have our own bathrooms now.

548
00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.708
Nice toilet paper scarf.

549
00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:14.083
Seriously?
Pantaloons this time of year?

550
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.833
I think Lincoln's gone
a little panta-looney. Get it?

551
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:20.291
What the what?

552
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:23.291
At least someone knows royalty
when they see it.

553
00:30:23.375 --> 00:30:27.666
The rest of you might wanna get on board.
'Cause this Loud is about to rule.

554
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.708
- Dinner is served.
- I'm okay.

555
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:33.208
I cooked everything in the castle.

556
00:30:33.291 --> 00:30:35.750
I ran out of garlic, so I used Gaelic.

557
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.375
Good one, Dad.

558
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:44.166
I call the turkey!

559
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.500
Save some for me.

560
00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:47.041
Yay, burritos!

561
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.666
This is all your doing.

562
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.333
It was my pleasure.

563
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:56.666
What a day!

564
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.083
The Louds are back and so is a dragon.

565
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.666
Bawitotos.

566
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.500
I'm so glad we did this.

567
00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:21.958
Aye, m'lady.
What a happy clan we have.

568
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.000
Thanks, Angus.

569
00:31:24.083 --> 00:31:25.750
Bawitos.

570
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:29.000
So, what's a guy got to do
to become the duke around here?

571
00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:29.916
Come again?

572
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.333
I was thinking about it,
and the duke and I look alike,

573
00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:37.791
we both have ten sisters, white hair,
a turkey tail, we're the same height...

574
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:39.833
Dragon.

575
00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:47.708
Holy moly, she grows fast.

576
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:49.166
Big girl!

577
00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:54.666
So the way I see it,
A plus B equals me being the new duke!

578
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.958
What do you think?

579
00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:59.041
Lincoln, I'm afraid
it's not that simple, lad.

580
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:03.083
Wisely spoken.
You should listen to Angus.

581
00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:06.166
One can only become the duke
by making life better

582
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.125
for the people and our village.

583
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:09.750
I see.

584
00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:12.375
Help the town and become the duke.

585
00:32:13.208 --> 00:32:14.416
Piece of cake.

586
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.000
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

587
00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:20.416
'Cause tomorrow, I'm gonna duke
this town up! Oh, yeah!

588
00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:25.083
You fool! Blathering on
to that featherbrained boy

589
00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.791
about becoming the duke!

590
00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:29.250
Oh, the people would love a new duke.

591
00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:32.208
Oh, the people would love a new duke.

592
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:34.958
I don't care a jot
about those peasants!

593
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:38.666
They're not peasants, Morag.
They're our neighbors, friends.

594
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.500
Enough with your twaddle!

595
00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:44.500
Thanks to you flapping your gob,
I'm stuck with these hooligans!

596
00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:47.875
Crashing through the crowded halls,
dodging girls like...

597
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.083
- Ping pong balls?
- Just to reach the bathroom on time.

598
00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:52.750
That's rather catchy.

599
00:32:52.833 --> 00:32:54.875
Don't you get cheeky with me.

600
00:32:54.958 --> 00:32:58.958
My ancestors have cared
for this castle in peace and quiet

601
00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:01.250
ever since they drove away the...

602
00:33:01.333 --> 00:33:06.791
I mean, ever since the, you know,
the first Louds sailed away forever.

603
00:33:06.875 --> 00:33:11.958
Oh, I deserve better than
to be banished to your wretched hovel.

604
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:13.666
It's only for a week.

605
00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:18.500
And you'll have oodles of quietness here
in my little castle.

606
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.791
Shall I give you the grand t...

607
00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:24.208
Good night, Morag.

608
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.833
Castle spirits, hear my plea.

609
00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:42.958
I summon a Loud from my family.

610
00:33:43.041 --> 00:33:46.083
On mystic winds, across Scottish moors,

611
00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:49.750
send the girl
who once walked these floors.

612
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.500
- What time is it?
- It's late.

613
00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:09.500
I'm still parachute-lagged.

614
00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:12.041
What's this about, Luce?
I need my sleep.

615
00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:16.458
My family from this world,
meet our family from another.

616
00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:18.375
Lucille Loud.

617
00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:21.708
Charmed, I'm sure.

618
00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:23.791
G-G-Ghost!

619
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.750
O-M-Ghost!

620
00:34:26.833 --> 00:34:29.291
She's like a glow-in-the-dark Lucy.

621
00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:33.416
It's a pleasure to meet you,
and to be home after 400 years.

622
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.083
Dragons and ghosts?

623
00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:38.666
This place has everything.

624
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.875
She's literally floating.

625
00:34:40.958 --> 00:34:43.416
Love the see-through look.

626
00:34:44.125 --> 00:34:45.583
- Honey?
- What?

627
00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:48.291
We did take this trip to meet relatives.

628
00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:50.458
Yeah, but not creepy ghosty ones.

629
00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:52.250
I heard that.

630
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:11.083
- Good morning, Morag.
- Your athletic supporter, sir?

631
00:35:11.166 --> 00:35:12.791
Not mine.

632
00:35:14.666 --> 00:35:16.083
Dear Old Aggie,

633
00:35:16.166 --> 00:35:19.250
you so cleverly drove away
those royal ruffians

634
00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:20.958
to have peace and quiet.

635
00:35:21.041 --> 00:35:24.666
How pained you'd be to hear
new Louds have returned!

636
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.375
Thank goodness it's only for a week.

637
00:35:27.958 --> 00:35:29.583
- I wanna ride her!
- My turn!

638
00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:31.625
Oh, you found it. Thanks, Morag.

639
00:35:35.416 --> 00:35:38.458
Poor Aggie!
Look what those beasts did to you.

640
00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.750
- Say ah.
- Ah.

641
00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:48.958
Excellent.

642
00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:52.875
Is someone there?

643
00:35:52.958 --> 00:35:54.333
I...

644
00:35:58.666 --> 00:35:59.708
Poo-poo.

645
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:03.250
Only for a week.

646
00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:05.500
Good day, lad.

647
00:36:05.583 --> 00:36:08.166
You got that right.
I'm about to become the new duke!

648
00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:12.125
You might wanna tell Morag
to start polishing that crown.

649
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:14.458
I certainly will not be doing that.

650
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.166
<i>I used to feel like a nobody</i>

651
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.416
<i>'Cause my sisters always
steal the spotlight</i>

652
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:24.125
<i>But now I know that I can be somebody</i>

653
00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:27.250
<i>The most special Loud in all the land</i>

654
00:36:29.083 --> 00:36:31.250
<i>I'm gonna turn some heads around</i>

655
00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:33.583
<i>Make everybody know my name</i>

656
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:37.208
<i>I'll bring a little loud
into this quiet place</i>

657
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:41.083
<i>And no one's ever
gonna steal my spotlight</i>

658
00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:43.041
<i>I'll be the talk of the town</i>

659
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:46.250
<i>This comic book's gotta go,
Ace Savvy's all you should know</i>

660
00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:50.083
<i>Have a breakfast burrito on me</i>

661
00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:53.333
<i>Step right up to my show
for some magic and gold</i>

662
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:55.916
<i>You can thank me later, 'cause</i>

663
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.125
<i>I'm gonna be the duke</i>

664
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:01.541
<i>It's my time, my turn to be</i>

665
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:05.041
<i>The new duke in history</i>

666
00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:08.458
<i>Gonna show my family</i>

667
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:10.041
<i>I'm ready to rule</i>

668
00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:11.916
<i>I'm gonna be the duke</i>

669
00:37:12.833 --> 00:37:17.708
<i>When you help out other people,
don't just do it to be in the spotlight</i>

670
00:37:17.791 --> 00:37:19.500
<i>Or be the talk of the town</i>

671
00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:23.708
<i>Remember everything you do,
it's about them and not you</i>

672
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:26.166
<i>That's how you live like a Loud</i>

673
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:31.125
<i>If you want to wear the crown,
go make this town a better place</i>

674
00:37:31.208 --> 00:37:34.208
<i>Look into their hearts
and make some real change</i>

675
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:38.458
<i>'Cause magic tricks and short-term fixes
are not the answer</i>

676
00:37:38.541 --> 00:37:40.375
<i>You've gotta do some good deeds</i>

677
00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:44.041
<i>I hear you loud and clear,
I have to act more sincere</i>

678
00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:47.125
<i>That's the secret for me to win</i>

679
00:37:47.208 --> 00:37:50.666
<i>'Cause if I do this right,
I'll be in the spotlight</i>

680
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.333
<i>You can thank me later, 'cause...</i>

681
00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:55.916
<i>He's gonna be the duke</i>

682
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.750
<i>It's my time, my turn to be</i>

683
00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:02.666
<i>The new duke in history</i>

684
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.875
<i>Gonna show my family</i>

685
00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:07.291
<i>I'm ready to rule</i>

686
00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:09.458
<i>He's gonna be the duke</i>

687
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:15.000
So, did I make life better
around here or what?

688
00:38:16.208 --> 00:38:18.625
All right.
Then how do we make this official?

689
00:38:18.708 --> 00:38:21.750
- We have a coronation.
- Duke! Duke! Duke!

690
00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:26.833
Oh, how glorious. Loch Loud will have
a new duke for a week.

691
00:38:26.916 --> 00:38:28.041
Duke for a week?

692
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:31.333
Actually, six days, 11 hours,
23 minutes and four seconds.

693
00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:32.708
But who's counting?

694
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:35.083
I burst into dance for a tourist?

695
00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:37.125
Never mind.

696
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.166
Such a shame.

697
00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:42.333
Lincoln?

698
00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:45.625
Take heart, lad.
The hard part is over.

699
00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:48.125
Our people want you to be the duke.

700
00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:51.916
Now all you need to do is convince
your family to move here, eh?

701
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.083
Easy peasy.

702
00:38:58.166 --> 00:38:59.125
How do I look?

703
00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:01.833
Brilliant, sir. But why a suit?

704
00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:04.875
It's my blue convincing suit.
Patent pending.

705
00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:08.208
I wear it whenever I need to talk
my family into something.

706
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:10.916
It's never let me down.
Right, Lil?

707
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.708
Man with plan.

708
00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:20.416
Scotland! Where the Loud clan
first rose to prominence.

709
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.791
Our family came here on vacation
to find our ancestors.

710
00:39:23.875 --> 00:39:25.625
We found so much more.

711
00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:28.916
We found our town,
our castle, our history.

712
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.750
And most importantly,
we found ourselves.

713
00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:33.916
So true.

714
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.500
But soon, our vacation will end.

715
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:38.416
No!

716
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.666
Unless we seize the chance
of a lifetime and fulfill our destiny!

717
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.000
How, you may ask?

718
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:48.375
By moving to Scotland,
where the Louds can truly live loud!

719
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.416
Loud and proud.

720
00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:56.875
That last part always gets me.
So?

721
00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:59.125
I'm in!
Scotland forever!

722
00:39:59.583 --> 00:40:03.166
This is all 'cause you wanna be the duke.

723
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.500
What? No.
It has nothing to do...

724
00:40:05.583 --> 00:40:07.083
- No, no!
- Busted.

725
00:40:07.166 --> 00:40:08.791
- No, no, no.
- Fat chance, Lincoln.

726
00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:11.250
Yeah, okay.
So maybe that has a little to do with it.

727
00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:13.541
But moving here would be
wonderful for all of us!

728
00:40:13.625 --> 00:40:17.916
Sweetie, we're on vacation.
We have a life in Royal Woods.

729
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.416
- Not to mention schools.
- Friends.

730
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.291
Adoring fans.

731
00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:24.375
We're not moving to Scotland.

732
00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:25.291
Yeah.

733
00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:27.958
Mom's right. Forget it.

734
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:31.166
We should just enjoy our vacation
and go back home...

735
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.208
to our house with one bathroom.

736
00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:39.125
We're moving to Scotland.

737
00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:54.375
- Go, Lincoln!
- That's my brother.

738
00:40:54.458 --> 00:40:56.125
Royalty runs in the family.

739
00:40:56.208 --> 00:40:57.833
Oh, thank you.

740
00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:12.708
For four centuries, our loch
has been without a duke,

741
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:15.416
ever since the first Louds
broke our hearts

742
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.708
and decided to sail away forever.

743
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.208
I cannot believe my ears.

744
00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:26.583
From today on,
our village will be duke-less no more.

745
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:34.500
Lincoln Albert Loud,
by the powers vested in me...

746
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.208
Cool duke stick.

747
00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:39.333
It's the royal scepter, sire.

748
00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:45.125
By the powers vested in me,

749
00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.375
I dub thee

750
00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:49.291
the...

751
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:54.125
I dub thee...

752
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:59.000
Duke of...

753
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.458
The Duke of Loch Loud.

754
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:09.500
Yes!

755
00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:19.541
<i>Shouting through the empty halls
just to hear an echo call</i>

756
00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:22.000
<i>Trying to find the bathroom on time</i>

757
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:24.875
<i>Hopscotch on the royal tiles,
corridors that run for miles</i>

758
00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:28.791
<i>It's the perfect home
for the rest of our lives</i>

759
00:42:28.875 --> 00:42:31.458
<i>Loud Castle, Loud Castle</i>

760
00:42:31.541 --> 00:42:34.166
<i>Yell, stretch, spreading out,
even got our own town</i>

761
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.750
<i>Loud Castle, Loud Castle</i>

762
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:40.166
<i>All the room we'll ever need,
it feels good to finally breathe</i>

763
00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:42.333
<i>Loud! Castle!</i>

764
00:42:43.416 --> 00:42:44.875
<i>Loud! Loud Castle!</i>

765
00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:49.083
<i>It's all about me now,
spotlight on Lincoln Loud</i>

766
00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:54.833
<i>Stepping out of the crowd
to really shine</i>

767
00:42:55.875 --> 00:43:00.083
<i>Dub me the one and only</i>

768
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:06.750
<i>The spotlight is on me
and this time it's all mine</i>

769
00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:09.375
<i>Loud Castle, Loud Castle</i>

770
00:43:09.458 --> 00:43:12.125
<i>So much empty space
with no one in your face</i>

771
00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:14.666
<i>Loud Castle, Loud Castle</i>

772
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.541
<i>Eleven kids, a zillion rooms,
I guess it'll have to do</i>

773
00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:20.250
<i>Loud Castle, Loud Castle</i>

774
00:43:20.333 --> 00:43:23.833
<i>Home was sweet but so compact,
why would we return to that?</i>

775
00:43:23.916 --> 00:43:25.708
<i>Loud! Castle!</i>

776
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:28.875
<i>Loud! Loud Castle!</i>

777
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.333
Loud Castle!

778
00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.833
Isn't this awesome?

779
00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:39.500
Us Louds, you two,
hanging at the castle just like old times.

780
00:44:16.916 --> 00:44:20.458
I hate...

781
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:27.333
the Louds!

782
00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:44.500
- What a wretched day.
- I wish we were out in it.

783
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:51.000
But seriously, cousin,
we have an urgent matter to discuss.

784
00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:53.166
Our bond of eternal sadness?

785
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.041
Nay, what I must say,
others may not want to hear.

786
00:44:58.416 --> 00:45:02.208
Lucy, what Morag said
at the coronation is not true.

787
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:04.958
My family did return to Loch Loud.

788
00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:09.166
On that fateful day,
our hearts were as full as our sails.

789
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.125
We longed to be home again.

790
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.208
I've missed me laboratory.

791
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:14.458
And my coffin.

792
00:45:14.541 --> 00:45:17.458
And me Scott.
He's from Scott Land.

793
00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:18.666
We know.

794
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:23.125
Home is on the horizon.
Land ho!

795
00:45:26.083 --> 00:45:29.791
Look, family! It's our Lolo.
She's come to escort us home.

796
00:45:29.875 --> 00:45:32.583
- Lolo!
- That's our girl!

797
00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:40.875
What's come over her?
She's turning us away.

798
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:43.375
- How are we to get home?
- We're not.

799
00:45:43.458 --> 00:45:44.958
The dragon forbids it.

800
00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:45.916
But why?

801
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.833
According to ancient lore,
the dragon is the protector of the loch

802
00:45:49.916 --> 00:45:54.041
and a duke's truest friend,
until it deems the duke worthy no more.

803
00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:55.666
Ding dang ancient lore!

804
00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.541
I've done nothing to earn such a fate.
Lolo, I command thee to let us pass!

805
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:05.750
'Tis no use, dear brother.
Our fate has been decided.

806
00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:09.666
I shan't argue with that.
Mother, turn the ship around.

807
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.791
And to all,
bid your farewell to Loch Loud.

808
00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.750
What now?

809
00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:17.625
You must give the crown back.

810
00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:19.875
Of course.

811
00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:34.291
That's so sad.

812
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:37.125
Normally I like sad, but that's too much.

813
00:46:37.208 --> 00:46:40.375
Why would Morag lie
about your family never returning?

814
00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:42.500
Our caretaker Old Aggie!

815
00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:45.916
She kept a journal that chronicled
everything that happened in the castle.

816
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.458
Perhaps the answer lies within its pages.
I wonder where it may be?

817
00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:58.458
My deviously brilliant,
wicked, dear Old Aggie.

818
00:47:00.958 --> 00:47:05.083
You were the first to rid this loch
of hideous Louds!

819
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.500
Well done,
you monstrous, pea-brained cretin.

820
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.666
You got rid of your duke
and I shall get rid of mine!

821
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:58.041
Hi, Lincoln!

822
00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.208
How is the best bud that a best bud

823
00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:02.250
could ever have enjoying his vacation?

824
00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:05.708
You won't believe it, Clyde!
Turns out my family is royalty

825
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:08.083
and I'm the new Duke of Loch Loud.

826
00:48:08.166 --> 00:48:10.583
Holy dream puff! That's awesome!

827
00:48:10.666 --> 00:48:14.166
I guess now that you're a duke,
you don't have to worry if you're special.

828
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.416
Yup! No more being stuck
in my sisters' shadows.

829
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.166
- Yes!
- All hail the duke!

830
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:24.125
Wait a minute. How are you gonna be
the Duke of Loch Loud in Royal Woods?

831
00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:26.666
Do they have, like, an exchange program?

832
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.333
Not exactly, which is why...

833
00:48:31.166 --> 00:48:32.708
we moved to Scotland.

834
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.375
Clyde?

835
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.291
Lincoln, this is the coolest news!

836
00:48:39.375 --> 00:48:43.750
It is? That's such a relief.
I can't wait for you to come visit.

837
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:46.333
Me too! I'd love to visit Scotland!
Hey, I gotta go.

838
00:48:46.416 --> 00:48:49.708
But call me later, 'cause I wanna hear
all about your new amazing life!

839
00:48:56.625 --> 00:48:57.958
Needs more cinnamon.

840
00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:01.291
Ah, what a friend.

841
00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:05.125
The sisters! Yes, that's it.

842
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:11.291
<i>The time has come to play pretend</i>

843
00:49:11.375 --> 00:49:15.125
<i>And I'll trick Lincoln
into thinking I'm his friend</i>

844
00:49:15.208 --> 00:49:19.916
<i>And I'll humiliate the boy, you'll see,
and drive the Louds away from me</i>

845
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.416
<i>For good</i>

846
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.541
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

847
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:26.583
<i>I must do more!</i>

848
00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:29.583
<i>So other Louds never set foot
upon this shore</i>

849
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:32.291
<i>To stop them coming after me</i>

850
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:36.250
<i>I'll need the crown's authority
for all to see</i>

851
00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:38.875
<i>The duchess I must be</i>

852
00:49:38.958 --> 00:49:41.000
<i>It's what you started</i>

853
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:42.833
<i>I vow to finish</i>

854
00:49:42.916 --> 00:49:46.250
<i>The reign of Louds
over this castle will diminish</i>

855
00:49:46.791 --> 00:49:53.125
<i>'Cause if I want tranquility</i>

856
00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:55.625
<i>The duchess I must be</i>

857
00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:05.000
<i>This foolish town adores that boy</i>

858
00:50:05.083 --> 00:50:08.666
<i>But I will break their little hearts,
oh, what a joy!</i>

859
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:13.041
<i>And with the dragon on my side,
I'll take the duke for a royal ride</i>

860
00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.000
<i>What an embarrassing turn of events</i>

861
00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:18.000
<i>It's what you started</i>

862
00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:19.791
<i>I vow to finish</i>

863
00:50:19.875 --> 00:50:23.333
<i>The reign of Louds
over this castle will diminish</i>

864
00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:30.000
<i>'Cause if I want tranquility</i>

865
00:50:30.083 --> 00:50:32.208
<i>The duchess I must be</i>

866
00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:35.208
<i>Is it wrong to long for quiet?</i>

867
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:38.708
<i>Should I just let this family be?</i>

868
00:50:38.791 --> 00:50:40.625
<i>No</i>

869
00:50:40.708 --> 00:50:46.916
<i>The Louds will sail across the sea</i>

870
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.958
<i>And then this town belongs to me</i>

871
00:50:54.041 --> 00:50:56.583
<i>The duchess I will be</i>

872
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.041
Morag.

873
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:07.625
You... You're a ghost!

874
00:51:07.708 --> 00:51:11.833
You told the people that my family
sailed away forever. 'Tis not true.

875
00:51:11.916 --> 00:51:13.250
I was there.

876
00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:16.708
I know only what
my ancestors passed down to me.

877
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:18.500
I want to see for myself.

878
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:21.583
- Old Aggie's journal. Where might it be?
- A journal?

879
00:51:21.666 --> 00:51:24.333
I didn't know she kept a journal.

880
00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:26.416
We've got our eyes on you.

881
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:45.375
Bravo, Miss Luna. Bravo.

882
00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:48.416
Aw, thanks, Morag, dude.
Rock on!

883
00:51:48.541 --> 00:51:50.083
Indeed.

884
00:51:50.166 --> 00:51:53.916
May... May I ask? Why hide
your musical light under a bushel?

885
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.583
I'd tell you if I knew what that meant.

886
00:51:56.666 --> 00:51:59.875
The village has not heard
such stunning bagpipery

887
00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:02.666
since the golden age of your ancestors.

888
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.958
I had no idea
my oldies liked to rock.

889
00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:09.000
Yes, they excelled in many things.

890
00:52:09.083 --> 00:52:12.458
Music, fashion, sport, wise-crackery.

891
00:52:13.875 --> 00:52:16.791
It was they who put the loud in Loch Loud.

892
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.333
Oh, how the people would love

893
00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:24.208
for that golden age to return
with you lassies.

894
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:26.416
I'm snacking what you're packing.

895
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.416
Come again?

896
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.625
I'm in, dude!
I'll go tell the other lassies.

897
00:52:57.041 --> 00:53:00.916
Ooh, a letter! Say thanks to Lisa,
big metal bee.

898
00:53:02.458 --> 00:53:04.208
I'm supes excited!

899
00:53:04.291 --> 00:53:06.541
My sisters and I are gonna perform
in the village.

900
00:53:06.625 --> 00:53:09.333
And you'll look smashing
in this new dress.

901
00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:10.541
Oopsie.

902
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:13.250
Oopsie.

903
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:15.125
Quite funny.

904
00:53:20.916 --> 00:53:23.541
For my next
spellbinding act of magic,

905
00:53:24.333 --> 00:53:25.666
I need one crown.

906
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:27.875
Voila!

907
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:28.791
Oh, dear.

908
00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:31.833
Royal crown, I see thee so.

909
00:53:31.916 --> 00:53:35.458
But this duke is hungry,
and he wants a burrito!

910
00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:43.666
My bad, Lil. I didn't give you
enough time for the switcheroo.

911
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.625
Oh, no, sire!
It was jolly good enchantment!

912
00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:51.458
Now, Sir Duke, I believe it's time
for you to seize the royal day

913
00:53:51.541 --> 00:53:53.750
and go to the village,
and serve your people!

914
00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:57.416
I think me and Lil will stay here
and work on our trick.

915
00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.166
But, sire,
the people have been waiting 400 years

916
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.208
for their duke to make
their loch a finer place.

917
00:54:03.791 --> 00:54:05.583
Well, when you put it that way...

918
00:54:05.666 --> 00:54:09.208
Lil, your big bro's got
some important duke business to do.

919
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.750
A banner job, sire.

920
00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:19.291
Our chimneys have needed
a keen spiffying for centuries.

921
00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:21.000
How many more?

922
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:24.000
One down. Just 432 to go.

923
00:54:27.208 --> 00:54:29.458
Well, it's worth it
if the people are happy.

924
00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:32.208
Sire, I'm not certain
where that's coming from.

925
00:54:34.416 --> 00:54:37.125
What? Not again!

926
00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:39.458
Lincoln? Is everything all right?

927
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:41.500
Luna! Luna!

928
00:54:41.583 --> 00:54:44.666
When is a piece of wood like a king?
When it's a ruler.

929
00:54:45.708 --> 00:54:48.666
Here's Leni Loud.
She's the talk of the Highlands.

930
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.166
This is what talent looks like, people.

931
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.291
Yeah!

932
00:54:53.375 --> 00:54:55.875
Look at that sister skating!

933
00:54:57.416 --> 00:54:59.833
Oh, yeah. Drink in the talent.

934
00:54:59.916 --> 00:55:03.333
Loud sisters hoo! Loud sisters ha!
Loud sisters ho, ho, ho!

935
00:55:06.708 --> 00:55:09.208
Oh, poor, poor duke.

936
00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:12.791
It's not fair. I'm the duke!

937
00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:15.416
I'm supposed to be
the most special Loud of all.

938
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.000
Not stuck in your sisters' shadows.

939
00:55:18.083 --> 00:55:19.875
That's what I always say.

940
00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:22.791
Is it now?

941
00:55:23.291 --> 00:55:26.000
There must be something we could do

942
00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:29.791
to put a proper spotlight
on our dear duke.

943
00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:30.708
Yeah.

944
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.041
What about that?

945
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:39.833
- What about what, sire?
- That!

946
00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:42.916
I could ride the dragon
just like my ancestor.

947
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.333
Brilliant idea, sire!

948
00:55:45.416 --> 00:55:47.375
I can just picture it.

949
00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:52.083
The people watch you soar overhead,
then break into cheers,

950
00:55:52.166 --> 00:55:57.000
more certain than ever that you are
the most special Loud there ever was.

951
00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:59.041
This is gonna be so awesome!

952
00:55:59.125 --> 00:56:01.208
Oh, yes.

953
00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.500
More than you could ever imagine.

954
00:56:15.791 --> 00:56:17.625
Hello, my people!

955
00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:19.875
Oh, look at that!

956
00:56:19.958 --> 00:56:21.000
Lincoln?

957
00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:22.458
Go, Lela!

958
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:30.625
This is amazing.

959
00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:45.083
Duked it.

960
00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:47.541
No one's ridden a dragon here
in centuries.

961
00:56:47.625 --> 00:56:49.500
He drew his own face!

962
00:56:49.583 --> 00:56:51.833
Hey! Adoring fans?

963
00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:53.750
Yes!

964
00:56:55.791 --> 00:56:57.875
Time for the real spectacle.

965
00:57:04.916 --> 00:57:06.833
Lela, what are you doing?

966
00:57:08.708 --> 00:57:10.791
- Lincoln!
- My baby bro.

967
00:57:11.791 --> 00:57:13.833
Why... can't... I steer you?

968
00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.416
- Lincoln.
- This way!

969
00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:22.208
- Come on.
- There he is!

970
00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:23.291
- Lincoln!
- Stop!

971
00:57:23.375 --> 00:57:25.041
Get out of the way!

972
00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:26.166
Look out!

973
00:57:34.916 --> 00:57:38.125
Oh, no! We're in-tuh-rubble.
Get it?

974
00:57:43.333 --> 00:57:45.458
- Help!
- Lad, grab on!

975
00:57:51.625 --> 00:57:53.291
Och, steady now, I've got you!

976
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.583
There you go.

977
00:58:07.416 --> 00:58:08.416
Oh, no.

978
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.958
Don't worry.
I can fix everything.

979
00:58:11.041 --> 00:58:13.416
I'm the duke, remember?
Here, watch.

980
00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:15.791
See? Good as new.

981
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:22.875
Oh, no!

982
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.958
It's okay.
You still have the fish shop.

983
00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:26.375
That's a relief.

984
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.625
How could you?

985
00:58:32.708 --> 00:58:35.416
- We trusted you.
- I loved that chippie!

986
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.625
How dare he?

987
00:58:41.541 --> 00:58:42.416
Lincoln!

988
00:58:47.083 --> 00:58:49.166
- What a mess.
- It's a disaster.

989
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:51.875
- This place is trashed.
- Total bummer.

990
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:21.791
Oh, don't be sad.

991
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:25.750
Lela did precisely what
she was asked to do.

992
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.416
That's it.

993
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.375
Good girl! Morag needs you
to be big and strong.

994
00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:48.583
Even dukes have bad days, sire.

995
00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:53.583
Bad day? Try worst day ever.
From the worst duke ever.

996
00:59:54.666 --> 00:59:57.208
It hurts me to hear you say such a thing.

997
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:59.958
The people need you now more than ever.

998
01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.083
Lincoln? Lincoln?

999
01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:04.166
Hey, everyone! I found him!

1000
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.583
- Are you all right?
- How you doing, buddy?

1001
01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:12.500
- We were worried about you, honey.
- Yeah, you really bombed out there.

1002
01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:14.000
- Lola!
- Not funny.

1003
01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:15.250
Totally uncool, dude.

1004
01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.833
If you'll let me finish!

1005
01:00:17.916 --> 01:00:21.208
We all blow it sometimes.
Even me.

1006
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:23.750
We want you to know
that we talked about it,

1007
01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:26.375
and tomorrow,
we're gonna help you rebuild the town.

1008
01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:30.250
Really?
Aw, you guys are the best.

1009
01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.166
Well, of course they are!
They're Louds!

1010
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.291
Do you think the people will forgive me?

1011
01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:38.958
If there's one thing about our people,
it's that they don't keep a grudge.

1012
01:00:40.916 --> 01:00:44.625
Go home, Duke!
Go home, Duke! Go home, Duke!

1013
01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.083
- We've lost everything!
- Out with you!

1014
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.250
Leave our loch!

1015
01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:50.083
They're just blowing off some steam.

1016
01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:53.125
- Oh, they'll come around.
- Just give 'em time, bro.

1017
01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:56.208
No, they're right.

1018
01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:02.875
Sire, no. I beg of you.

1019
01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:06.291
I don't deserve to be the duke.

1020
01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.875
Can we go home now?

1021
01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.250
Toodle pip. Bye-bye!

1022
01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.708
I wouldn't want this
to be seen by the wrong eyes.

1023
01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:47.541
Now, dear Aggie,
it's time I fulfilled my destiny.

1024
01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:04.083
Gasp. It cannot be.
Old Aggie betrayed us!

1025
01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:14.291
My dearest friends, thanks to you,
the Louds will be gone forevermore!

1026
01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:16.041
Great job!

1027
01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:20.375
Glad that's over. Back home we go.

1028
01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:22.750
Oh, sorry, almost forgot to mention.

1029
01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:25.708
Before the Louds skedaddled off,

1030
01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:29.166
they requested
that I be crowned duchess!

1031
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.791
I was like, me? What?

1032
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:33.958
They were like...
Yeah, totally, you're the best.

1033
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:38.416
It was so embarrassing.
But how could I say no?

1034
01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:43.250
So let's get on with it.
Trumpets, robe, adoration.

1035
01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:45.833
Morag, this is not...

1036
01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.416
By the power vested in me,
blahddy blah blah,

1037
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:52.333
Angus dubs me
the Duchess of Loch Loud!

1038
01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.208
You can't do this.

1039
01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:58.166
Silence, you ninny.

1040
01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:06.541
Oh, for argyle's sake.

1041
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:14.916
Duchess!
Duchess! Duchess!

1042
01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.125
No!

1043
01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:23.333
The Louds did no such thing.

1044
01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:26.250
I was there.
They never gave you the crown!

1045
01:03:26.333 --> 01:03:29.458
Angus is as honest as the day is long.

1046
01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:31.250
Is it true, Morag?

1047
01:03:32.416 --> 01:03:34.750
You know what? I could lie.

1048
01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:36.875
But why bother?

1049
01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.333
Guilty as accused!

1050
01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:44.291
Our people deserve better
than a liar and a thief!

1051
01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:47.041
We willnae stand for it!
Imposter!

1052
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.208
Very well.
I tried doing this the nice way.

1053
01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:54.250
Now I'll do it my way.

1054
01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:21.000
We've been run out of lots
of malls before,

1055
01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:22.625
but never a whole country.

1056
01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:25.375
I didn't get to say goodbye to Scott!

1057
01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:27.458
Lela!

1058
01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:28.958
Or Lucille.

1059
01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:33.125
- Yo, Luce, looks like you'll get a chance.
- Gasp!

1060
01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.750
Cousins! Cousins!

1061
01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:37.583
Lucille.

1062
01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.625
I come with grave news.

1063
01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:40.875
The best kind.

1064
01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.333
Not this time, Lucy.

1065
01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:46.916
Morag has stolen the crown
from our family and made herself duchess.

1066
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:47.833
- Rude!
- What?

1067
01:04:47.916 --> 01:04:48.916
That's nefarious.

1068
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.166
She can't do that.

1069
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.583
We knew Morag couldn't be trusted.

1070
01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:54.625
But I did trust her.

1071
01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:58.166
- I fear it gets worse.
- Of course it does.

1072
01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.916
Morag is using the dragon
to chase away the people of Loch Loud.

1073
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.333
- What?
- How?

1074
01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:08.958
With the ancient dragon stone.
It can turn a good dragon evil.

1075
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.791
Wait. My dragon ride.

1076
01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:15.791
That's why I couldn't control Lela!
She was under Morag's power.

1077
01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:19.250
Translation, Morag wrecked
the village, not you.

1078
01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.625
It's still my fault.

1079
01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:26.125
I wanted to be the duke so badly,
I let Morag trick me.

1080
01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:29.166
Now those people will lose their homes.

1081
01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:32.750
I've gotta do something about this.

1082
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.083
No, we all do.

1083
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:38.208
You're always helping us.

1084
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:40.500
This time, we're helping you.

1085
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.833
Careful now.

1086
01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:52.708
Hurry. Come on, this way.

1087
01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.916
- Angus.
- Blow me bagpipes!

1088
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.500
Sire! Sisters!

1089
01:05:56.583 --> 01:06:00.083
You're back! But I'm afraid
Morag is mad as a March hare!

1090
01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:04.250
We know. We've got a plan
to get that scepter and save the village.

1091
01:06:10.208 --> 01:06:14.875
I'd say day one as the duchess
has been a smashing success!

1092
01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:18.583
Peace and quiet at last.

1093
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.083
Testing one, two, three.

1094
01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:24.208
- What?
- Let's start the show.

1095
01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:25.541
The Louds!

1096
01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:31.500
- I don't ding-dang get it.
- A boat, a crown, a muscle-arm?

1097
01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:34.666
And a smiley-face poop?
What is Leni trying to tell us?

1098
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.416
Boat go bye-bye.

1099
01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:40.458
Kids!

1100
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:42.708
- Starboard!
- What does that mean?

1101
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.166
I don't know!

1102
01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:53.041
I thought I was done with you!

1103
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:56.750
Show yourselves,
you deplorable, knee-high plonkers.

1104
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.041
Okay, girls!

1105
01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:03.708
Operation Get The Scepter From Morag
And Save The Village Before It's Too Late

1106
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:06.875
And Also Think Of A Shorter Name
For This Operation is a go!

1107
01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.458
Luan, you're up.

1108
01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:14.791
<i>There once was a duchess named Morag
whose hair smelled like a floor rag</i>

1109
01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:19.166
<i>When she stole the crown,
everyone frowned</i>

1110
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.666
<i>'Cause now their ruler was a poo-bag</i>

1111
01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:24.916
Come on, feel the noise!

1112
01:07:28.416 --> 01:07:29.416
Fore!

1113
01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.041
Leni, go!

1114
01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:39.791
My eyes!

1115
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.791
That teeth whitening was worth it.

1116
01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:44.916
Oops. Sorry.

1117
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.291
- Lucy, you know what to do.
- Morag, catch me if you can.

1118
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.333
Gotcha.

1119
01:07:55.416 --> 01:07:57.958
I was almost a goner.
Maybe next time.

1120
01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.458
Fire!

1121
01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:03.083
Angus! What is going on?

1122
01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:06.375
- My dear Louds, it's madness!
- Where are the kids?

1123
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:09.458
Oh, you know, just battling
a fire-breathing dragon.

1124
01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:11.166
- This way.
- Wait! I'm not ready.

1125
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.208
- Now I'm ready.
- Blow me bagpipes!

1126
01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:20.416
That's it, Luce! Keep coming!

1127
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:23.041
Here we go. It's my turn.
I can do this.

1128
01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:26.375
Yes! I'm on the dragon.

1129
01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:28.250
I'm on the dragon!

1130
01:08:28.333 --> 01:08:29.750
Easy now.

1131
01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:35.625
Fire!

1132
01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:42.916
- You!
- I won't let you get away with this!

1133
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.250
- Let go!
- Never.

1134
01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:46.000
- You stole it.
- It's mine!

1135
01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:49.250
Lincoln needs our help.
We have to get the others.

1136
01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:54.041
I command you to let go!

1137
01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:57.000
Command?
Is that what this is all about? Power?

1138
01:08:57.083 --> 01:09:02.250
No, this crown will guarantee
no Louds ever bother me again!

1139
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:07.000
Hate to bother you, but...

1140
01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:17.333
Lincoln!

1141
01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:18.625
We're coming!

1142
01:09:19.291 --> 01:09:20.958
Holy moly!

1143
01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:24.625
- There he is!
- My baby!

1144
01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:26.833
We're here, brother. Don't worry.

1145
01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.833
No, Lela!

1146
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:33.541
Oh, you really bungled it.

1147
01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:38.208
You should have sailed away
while you had the chance!

1148
01:09:40.083 --> 01:09:44.083
Now prepare to be loud no more!

1149
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.541
Fire!

1150
01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:50.666
No!

1151
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.041
Stop!

1152
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:56.791
Lincoln!

1153
01:09:56.875 --> 01:10:00.208
You want the crown so bad?
Come and get it!

1154
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:02.166
- Lincoln!
- Don't do this!

1155
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.083
Lela.

1156
01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:12.458
- Lincoln!
- What do we do now?

1157
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.958
Just don't panic. Don't panic!
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1158
01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:20.291
Oh, what a pity. Nowhere to run.

1159
01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:24.458
This isn't the way to get what you want.
Maybe you can tell everyone you're sorry.

1160
01:10:24.541 --> 01:10:26.125
Why, yes, I could...

1161
01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:28.250
if I were a hare-brained fool!

1162
01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.875
Now give me the crown!

1163
01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:33.833
Never, Morag.

1164
01:10:33.916 --> 01:10:35.708
It's Duchess to you.

1165
01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:39.666
You can have all the crowns in the world,
but you'll never be the duchess.

1166
01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:42.541
You will never be special!

1167
01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:45.750
Just plain, boring Lincoln Loud.

1168
01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:50.000
Always in your sisters' shadows,
just where you belong.

1169
01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:52.833
You're wrong.

1170
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.333
I'm the fifth-best junior magician
in Royal Woods.

1171
01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.250
What?

1172
01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:00.125
What enchantment is this?

1173
01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.333
Enough!

1174
01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:08.750
No more tricks!

1175
01:11:10.625 --> 01:11:13.291
Except one! Presto!

1176
01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:19.625
Dragon, obliterate this ninny
and bring me the crown!

1177
01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:21.958
What?

1178
01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:26.416
Oh, dear.

1179
01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:30.166
Ta-da! Lela!

1180
01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:32.833
No!

1181
01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:38.375
Backup plan.

1182
01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:41.666
We did it! Way to go, Lily!

1183
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:45.291
All I wanted was my peace and quiet.

1184
01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:48.625
- And I will have it! Give me the crown!
- Let go!

1185
01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:56.625
Lincoln!

1186
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.291
Gotcha, Lil!

1187
01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.541
Wait. What?

1188
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.583
Lela!

1189
01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:08.708
Good girl.

1190
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.916
Slow down, Rita!

1191
01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:16.625
Careful, sweetie.

1192
01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.625
Lily flying dragon!

1193
01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:28.500
Let me go, you horrid beast!

1194
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:32.125
- That was awesome!
- Way to go, Linc and Lily!

1195
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.375
My babies!

1196
01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:37.208
Oh, Lela, we can't thank you enough.

1197
01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:39.375
Way to go, Lincoln.

1198
01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:40.666
We love you, Lela.

1199
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:42.125
Who's a good dragon?

1200
01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:45.333
To the Louds!
For saving our home!

1201
01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:51.041
To Lincoln, whom history will remember
as the loudest of the Louds!

1202
01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.541
I'm sorry we doubted you.

1203
01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:03.416
Duke Loud hoo! Duke Loud ha!
Duke Loud ho, ho, ho!

1204
01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:06.458
Our duke is back!

1205
01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:16.541
What you waiting for, Linc?
Put that baby on.

1206
01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.791
If you don't, I will.

1207
01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:25.166
Ever since we came here,
I wanted this crown more than anything.

1208
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:28.958
I thought if I had it,
I'd finally be special like my sisters.

1209
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.833
When I wore it,

1210
01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:33.125
all I cared about
was what it would do for me,

1211
01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:35.083
not what I could do for you.

1212
01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:37.750
I'm sorry for being selfish.

1213
01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:39.500
The thing is,

1214
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:42.750
someone kept trying to tell me
what it really means to wear the crown,

1215
01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:44.208
but I wouldn't listen.

1216
01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:46.208
I'm sorry for that too.

1217
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:51.958
That's why there's only one person
who deserves to wear this crown.

1218
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:56.666
- Angus, with the power vested in me...
- Lad, no.

1219
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.875
- By the royal Loud family...
- I can't.

1220
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:02.083
I dub thee the Duke of Loch Loud!

1221
01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:05.250
No, no, I'm just a simple groundskeeper.

1222
01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:08.666
- Oh, you're so much more.
- You're like family.

1223
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.375
You've always been there for us.

1224
01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:14.375
The people have spoken, Angus.

1225
01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.291
The duke!

1226
01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:21.750
- Astonishing.
- It's our family.

1227
01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.416
Yo, cuz!

1228
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.125
Twelve more ghosts.
That's fine. I'm totally fi...

1229
01:14:28.791 --> 01:14:31.750
A more worthy duke
I've never laid eyes upon.

1230
01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:35.375
For you are the true caretaker
of our home and us all.

1231
01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:37.541
Thank you, Your Dukeship.

1232
01:14:42.916 --> 01:14:45.333
Well, blow my bagpipes.

1233
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:53.500
- So, Duke, what about me fish shop?
- What about my chip shop?

1234
01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:54.666
What about her?

1235
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.750
Oh, dear.

1236
01:14:57.916 --> 01:14:59.666
Unhand me, beast!

1237
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:02.500
The dragon is the true guardian
of the loch.

1238
01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:04.458
She shall decide Morag's fate.

1239
01:15:07.416 --> 01:15:10.666
The joke's on you,
you scaly, putrid lummox!

1240
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.333
You gave me my peace and quiet.

1241
01:15:15.125 --> 01:15:17.083
What? No. No!

1242
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:20.416
No!

1243
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.708
Lincoln, you giving the crown
to Angus was the coolest!

1244
01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.958
You're a good dude, dude.

1245
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:29.125
Yes!

1246
01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:32.166
But all that stuff
about you not feeling special...

1247
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:33.291
What was that?

1248
01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:38.375
You're all so good at everything.

1249
01:15:38.458 --> 01:15:41.583
You win trophies,
get your pictures taken, and...

1250
01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:43.583
I wanted to be special too.

1251
01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:46.333
Lincoln, you are special.

1252
01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:47.291
I am?

1253
01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:50.833
Yeah. Just like how Angus
takes care of everyone in Loch Loud.

1254
01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:52.875
You take care of us.

1255
01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:54.250
Every day, bro.

1256
01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:55.625
For reals.

1257
01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:58.625
That's why you're
the most special brother ever.

1258
01:15:58.708 --> 01:16:00.375
- Literally.
- That's right.

1259
01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.916
- I'll say.
- Indubitably.

1260
01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.458
I'm good with that.

1261
01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:07.208
I love you, Lincoln.

1262
01:16:08.416 --> 01:16:10.041
Warm feelings.

1263
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.208
<i>I've been searching high and low</i>

1264
01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:21.750
<i>Looking for that place where I belong</i>

1265
01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:24.583
<i>Trying to find my way back home</i>

1266
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.791
<i>To the land
where I can sing my own song</i>

1267
01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:33.583
<i>Overlooked and overshadowed</i>

1268
01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:36.791
<i>How will I stand out?</i>

1269
01:16:36.875 --> 01:16:40.750
<i>Maybe now I can be
here on this side of the sea</i>

1270
01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:44.083
<i>With all my family standing beside me</i>

1271
01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.458
<i>They just might be the key</i>

1272
01:16:47.083 --> 01:16:50.625
<i>Can I find my kind of connection</i>

1273
01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:54.000
<i>And a whole new direction
to call my own?</i>

1274
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:57.916
<i>Staring back at my own reflection</i>

1275
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.208
<i>With a love and affection ♪</i>

1276
01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.666
<i>Now I know</i>

1277
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:06.458
<i>I'll always find my way back home</i>

1278
01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:22.791
- Get my good side.
- The brain belongs...

1279
01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:40.000
I'll miss you, lad.

1280
01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:45.166
If you ever need any duke advice,
you can call me.

1281
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:48.500
Deal. You are, after all,
the man with the plan.

1282
01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:50.541
Patent pending.

1283
01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:55.250
- Thank you!
- Bye! We'll be sure to write!

1284
01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:56.625
Goodbye!

1285
01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:00.625
Ah, that was one vacation
we'll never forget.

1286
01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:02.375
- That's right.
- Literally.

1287
01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:06.333
So long, adoring fans!
Try not to miss me too much!

1288
01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:14.291
Scotland! Finally!

1289
01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.416
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a girl named Lori Loud.

1290
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.250
Can you tell me where she is?

1291
01:18:35.708 --> 01:18:39.250
No!

1292
01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:50.291
- Welcome home, buddy.
- Thanks, Clyde.

1293
01:18:53.416 --> 01:18:56.166
Just the right amount of cinnamon.
