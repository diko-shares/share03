1
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.429
Abs, you ready?

2
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.474
Abby...

3
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.521
Abs.

4
00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.402
Come on. I know
you're in there. Let's go.

5
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.237
Abby, come on.

6
00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.532
Okay, okay.

7
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.825
You're being a jerk.

8
00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:09.034
You know I have somewhere
I have to be.

9
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.577
Come on, let's go.
Five minutes.

10
00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.831
I need you dressed.

11
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.918
Five minutes.

12
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.215
"And though
the dreamer remains asleep,

13
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.552
"he walks through memory
as if experiencing it

14
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.262
"for the first time anew,

15
00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:32.809
no longer a passenger
but an active participant."

16
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.982
This stuff for real?

17
00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:42.026
Some people think so.

18
00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.446
Guess it depends on
what you believe.

19
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.613
Summer of '82,

20
00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.532
I traded a mint condition
Cal Ripken Jr. rookie

21
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.576
for a used copy
of "Missile Command."

22
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.621
That card's probably worth
800 bucks now.

23
00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.874
I wish I could participate
in that memory

24
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.418
and actively kick my own ass.

25
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.128
Can I keep it?

26
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.921
No.

27
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.590
<i>I would like the walnut fudge,</i>

28
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.175
but I want the fudge on the side

29
00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.635
because I don't want it
to melt the ice cream.

30
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.512
And can I get
some whipped cream on top

31
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.765
and three cherries?

32
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.809
Coming right up.

33
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:17.937
Hey.

34
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.480
You want your usual, right?

35
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.983
Yeah.

36
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.487
So, when are you gonna bring
your sister by?

37
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.824
We got this new flavor,
Rainbow Explosion.

38
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.577
I bet she'll go crazy for it.

39
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.704
Mike?

40
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.586
Hey!

41
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.050
Hey!

42
00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.176
Hey!

43
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.688
Number 27?

44
00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.567
Number 27?

45
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.695
Number 27?

46
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.532
Follow me.

47
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:33.512
What is your deal, Mike?

48
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.849
What are you, some kind of...

49
00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.102
head case?

50
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.230
You beat up a man
in broad daylight.

51
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.482
In front of his child.

52
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.110
Daddy!

53
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.740
That was a mistake. Um...

54
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.324
It was a misunderstanding.
I-I thought...

55
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.535
Just look at
your employment record.

56
00:08:56.536 --> 00:09:00.080
Tire Zone, sales associate,
two months, terminated.

57
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.874
Insubordination.

58
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.960
Media World, custodial staff,
one week.

59
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.212
It's like
you're not even trying here,

60
00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:12.093
yet you sit before me
asking for help.

61
00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.304
I am just trying
to figure out who you are,

62
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.140
Mr. Michael Sh...

63
00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.235
Coffee?

64
00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:31.278
Sorry?

65
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.739
Would you, would you
like some...

66
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.449
some coffee?
I made some coffee.

67
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.993
No.

68
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.206
I'm-I'm gonna be brutally
honest with you here, Mike.

69
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.084
Given your track record,
your options...

70
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.586
are gonna be extremely limited.

71
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:50.339
I'll take anything, okay?
Any-any job you got. -No. No.

72
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.803
Look, I-I-I get that part.
Um, it's just...

73
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.014
You know, it's not that easy.

74
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.559
Yeah. Thank you.

75
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.938
I have a job for you.

76
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.191
Come on, sit down.

77
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.736
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

78
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.948
Okay, well, what is it?

79
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.951
It's a security gig.

80
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.787
It's not great.

81
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.122
Right? High turnover.

82
00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.707
That's what we call it
in the business,

83
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.126
but you get to be
your own boss. Sort of.

84
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.503
And you only have to worry
about one thing.

85
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.880
Keeping people out.

86
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.632
And-and, you know,
and keep the place tidy.

87
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.968
That's two things.

88
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.846
You want the job or not?

89
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.889
- How's the pay?
- Not great.

90
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.185
But the hours are worse.

91
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.646
I can't do nights.

92
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.733
Excuse me?

93
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.317
I can't do nights.

94
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.614
That's such a shame.

95
00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.701
Yeah.

96
00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:02.619
Thank you.

97
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.414
Wait...

98
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.084
In case you have
a change of heart.

99
00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:39.656
Hey, Max.

100
00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.368
Thanks for babysitting.

101
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.286
There's Stouffer's.

102
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:46.205
Should still be warm
if you're hungry.

103
00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.915
I have to tell
you, there is something magical

104
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.250
about these rings,
and you can have it within...

105
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.920
I wish someone would
buy me a ring.

106
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.547
Did Abby eat?

107
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.840
What do you think?

108
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.386
Same time tomorrow?

109
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.013
Yep.

110
00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.482
What do we got?

111
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.067
Okay.

112
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.736
Well, that good-looking guy
I recognize.

113
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.197
Who are all these other punks?

114
00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.741
My friends. It's not done yet.

115
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.119
Well, look, you can finish up
after we eat, all right?

116
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.620
Come get some food.

117
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.830
I'm not hungry.

118
00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.083
Abby, please, come eat.

119
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.586
- Come on. Here. Please come.
- No!

120
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.172
{\an8}Come and...

121
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.511
Abs, with the day
that I'm having,

122
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.931
can you just eat some food?

123
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.143
You're sitting on my friend.

124
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.522
You know what? I don't care.

125
00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.358
Do whatever you want.

126
00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:58.819
But you should know
what happens to little kids

127
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.196
who don't eat their dinners.

128
00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.116
Their bodies stay
the same size forever.

129
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.909
And they never get to ride

130
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.496
the adult rides
at the amusement park.

131
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.460
My friend says you're an idiot.

132
00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.548
At least I'm real.

133
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.653
How about some burger
with that ketchup, hon?

134
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.156
Everything's better
swimming in ketchup.

135
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:29.035
Right, Mike? Whoop.

136
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.578
I'm gonna go grab a towel.

137
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.957
- Go watch your brother, okay?
- Okay.

138
00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.918
Garrett.

139
00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.727
Garrett?

140
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:13.037
Garrett! Garrett!

141
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.730
Just look at my nephew.

142
00:15:39.731 --> 00:15:41.106
It's not even 10:00

143
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:42.733
and he-he can barely
keep his eyes open.

144
00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:46.612
And this degenerate
is who they entrust

145
00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.781
with the well-being
of a mentally ill child.

146
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.784
Jane, like I've said before,
Abby is not mentally ill.

147
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.327
Right.

148
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:54.953
Perfectly normal to sit around
drawing pictures all day

149
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:59.291
and-and talking to magical
creatures who do not exist.

150
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.626
Listen, I think we all just need

151
00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:02.878
- to calm...
- Don't tell me to calm down.

152
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.005
You're the doctor,
and you're making me feel like

153
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.674
I'm the crazy one?

154
00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:12.638
And after... after what he did
to that poor man...

155
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.972
I just...

156
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:23.148
I have really tried
to play nice. I have.

157
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.694
But I have to think
about Abby now.

158
00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.488
Enough is enough. Doug?

159
00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.783
Doug.

160
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.786
In your heart,

161
00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:37.996
you know that this is
the right thing to do.

162
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.791
I hope that you will sign.

163
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.501
- And if I don't?
- Well, then,

164
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.461
my lawyer and I will
have to take you to court,

165
00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.006
where any judge
with an ounce of sanity

166
00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:51.301
will see to it that you never
see your sister again.

167
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.345
That what you want?

168
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.389
She-she doesn't even care
about Abby.

169
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.517
All she wants is the
monthly check from the state.

170
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.521
But, I mean, she-she has
some good points, though.

171
00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.399
I'm hardly fit
to be raising a kid.

172
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.860
I know a little girl
who would strongly disagree.

173
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.361
Come on.

174
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.196
She talks to air
more than she talks to me.

175
00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:12.698
I could drop dead tomorrow,

176
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.784
and she'd be too busy drawing
to even notice.

177
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:19.204
You know, pictures hold
tremendous power for children.

178
00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:21.206
Before we learn to speak,

179
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.709
images are the most important
tool we have

180
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.253
for understanding
the world around us.

181
00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:29.423
What's real,
what matters to us most.

182
00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:32.301
These are things
children learn to communicate

183
00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.720
almost exclusively
through pictures.

184
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.722
Yeah, her pictures
mean something.

185
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:40.143
And who is at the center
of nine out of ten of them?

186
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:42.978
Me.

187
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.565
Like it or not,
you're her world.

188
00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.068
But what if it's not up to me?

189
00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.736
My aunt, she's an idiot,
but she's right.

190
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:53.781
No judge in their right mind
is ever gonna side with me.

191
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.242
Did you find a job yet?

192
00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.786
Okay.

193
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:01.955
That would be
a good place to start.

194
00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.345
- Hello.
- Hi.

195
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.263
Mr. Raglan, this is Mike.

196
00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.934
- Mr. "I can't work nights."
- Right.

197
00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.269
Yeah, I was just calling
to see if that job

198
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.147
that you offered was,
was still available.

199
00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.149
It absolutely is.

200
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.943
Why? Have you had
a change of heart?

201
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.283
How soon could I start?

202
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.671
<i>Let me give you
a little backstory.</i>

203
00:18:50.672 --> 00:18:54.509
This place was huge
in the '80s with the kids.

204
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.015
It's been shut down for years.

205
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.933
<i>The only reason
they haven't given it</i>

206
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.978
<i>the old wrecking ball treatment
is the owner's a bit of a...</i>

207
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.691
Well, he's kind of
a sentimental guy, I guess.

208
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:15.112
<i>Just can't bring himself
to let it go yet.</i>

209
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.867
Yeah.

210
00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.412
Had some trouble with break-ins
over the years.

211
00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.708
<i>Drunks and vagrants, mostly.
Not ideal.</i>

212
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:33.798
<i>Security system's dated
but fully functional.</i>

213
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.802
<i>Floodlights on the outside,
cameras inside and outside.</i>

214
00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:43.057
<i>The electricity is a bit...</i>

215
00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.393
<i>iffy.</i>

216
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:08.457
Anything happens, there is
a breaker in the main office.

217
00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.918
Just flip it.

218
00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:27.935
I guess that's about it.

219
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.104
You know...

220
00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.897
the rest is pretty easy.

221
00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:35.567
Just keep your eyes
on the monitors and...

222
00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.486
and keep people out.

223
00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.406
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

224
00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:10.728
<i>So, I will catch you
on the flip side.</i>

225
00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.814
Hopefully.

226
00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.839
The hell?

227
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:51.393
Welcome to
Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria,

228
00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:54.021
a magical place for kids
and grown-ups alike,

229
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.483
where fantasy and fun
come to life.

230
00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.694
If you're watching this video,
it means you've been selected

231
00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:03.238
as Freddy's
newest security guard.

232
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.907
Congratulations.

233
00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.035
We're going to have
so much fun together.

234
00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:11.830
The genius who created
Fazbear Entertainment

235
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.832
opened Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria

236
00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.002
to indulge in
his two greatest passions:

237
00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.671
family-friendly fun

238
00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.548
and cutting-edge
animatronic technology.

239
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:24.259
State-of-the-art
robotic engineering

240
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.762
enables our characters
to interact with guests

241
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:28.764
in truly lifelike fashion,

242
00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:31.725
while cleverly concealed
rechargeable lithium cells

243
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.895
give them limited range
to roam free.

244
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:38.982
Let's introduce you
to the stars of the show.

245
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:46.740
Adorable, aren't they?

246
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:49.034
Protecting
these cuddly critters,

247
00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.704
and the proprietary technology
that brings them to life,

248
00:22:51.705 --> 00:22:53.455
is now your sacred duty.

249
00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:57.876
Keep them safe, and help ensure
that Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria

250
00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.713
is here to delight,
dazzle and entertain

251
00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:02.715
for years to...

252
00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:07.846
All right.

253
00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:41.272
Hello?

254
00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:56.347
Everything's better
swimming in ketchup.

255
00:25:56.348 --> 00:25:58.307
Right, Mike?

256
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.311
Go watch your brother, okay?

257
00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:07.275
Garrett?

258
00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:12.697
Garrett!

259
00:26:28.672 --> 00:26:30.632
What is this?

260
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.344
Who are you?

261
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:37.137
That car.

262
00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:39.807
Did you see that car?
You see what happened?

263
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.983
Did you see who took my brother?

264
00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:51.819
Wait! No.

265
00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:30.859
- Hey.
- Hey, Max.

266
00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:39.951
So? How'd it go?

267
00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.289
It was interesting.

268
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.751
I should probably
get out of here.

269
00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:53.839
Hey, by the way, I-I do intend
on-on paying you, eventually.

270
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.841
It's okay.

271
00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:57.551
I know where you live.

272
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.410
Hey. Welcome to Sparky's.

273
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:25.621
Could I set you folks up
with some appetizers?

274
00:28:25.622 --> 00:28:27.581
Yes.

275
00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:29.041
We are not eating.

276
00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.751
Well, that's no fun.

277
00:28:30.752 --> 00:28:32.086
You do realize that lunch

278
00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:33.462
is the most important meal
of the day?

279
00:28:33.463 --> 00:28:35.631
I thought it was breakfast.

280
00:28:35.632 --> 00:28:37.216
Some people say that,

281
00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:39.051
but, you know, it's just
a theory. -Are you being paid

282
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:41.053
by the word,
or could we have a minute?

283
00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:43.806
- All right.
- Thank you.

284
00:28:43.807 --> 00:28:45.557
Where were we?

285
00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:47.142
You were about to tell me

286
00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.310
what a miserable failure
you are.

287
00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:50.562
Hey, screw you, lady.

288
00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:53.190
My sister went over every inch
of that dump a thousand times.

289
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:56.568
If there was something to find,
she would have found it.

290
00:28:56.569 --> 00:28:58.028
Now pay up.

291
00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:00.406
- I'm sorry?
- You said 200.

292
00:29:00.407 --> 00:29:02.157
We had a deal.

293
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:04.243
Yeah, that you were
gonna find me

294
00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:07.037
hard proof
of criminal endangerment.

295
00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:10.040
Instead, you've told me
what a nice kid my niece is

296
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.042
and that my nephew sleeps a lot.

297
00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:13.419
He really does, though.

298
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.630
Sleeping is not a crime.

299
00:29:16.631 --> 00:29:18.215
Is that guy okay?

300
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:21.510
I just realized I shouldn't
be hearing any of this.

301
00:29:21.511 --> 00:29:24.388
As a matter of fact,
I shouldn't be here at all.

302
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:25.890
Sit down, Doug.

303
00:29:27.017 --> 00:29:28.600
So, I guess we're finished here,

304
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:31.228
unless either one of you
has a brilliant idea,

305
00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:33.647
which I realize
is highly unlikely.

306
00:29:33.648 --> 00:29:35.567
Why don't we just kill him?

307
00:29:38.778 --> 00:29:41.280
Tempting. But no.

308
00:29:41.281 --> 00:29:44.616
- What else?
- Mike was saying that...

309
00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:48.954
he really needs this new job
to, like, look good on paper

310
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:51.165
for the judge or something.

311
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.708
Well, that's all
very fascinating, honey,

312
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:54.961
but I am not hearing a plan.

313
00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:57.505
We toss the place.

314
00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.050
Go on. -Well,
he's a security guard, right?

315
00:30:01.051 --> 00:30:03.927
His job is to make sure
nobody gets in.

316
00:30:03.928 --> 00:30:07.181
So, we get in,

317
00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:09.141
and we mess up the place good.

318
00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:11.602
We help ourselves to whatever
we find along the way.

319
00:30:11.603 --> 00:30:13.479
Your nephew gets canned.

320
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.774
Judge gives you the kid,
and you give us...

321
00:30:16.775 --> 00:30:19.361
$2,000.

322
00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:22.113
One thousand.

323
00:30:22.906 --> 00:30:26.033
But do it fast,
and don't mess it up.

324
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.534
I mean, you know, mess it up,

325
00:30:27.535 --> 00:30:30.579
but don't...
don't mess this up.

326
00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:40.130
Come on.

327
00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:42.133
What are you doing?

328
00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:47.429
Abby, do you need something?

329
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.139
No. -All right,
quit playing and take that off.

330
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.307
I have to go to work.

331
00:30:50.308 --> 00:30:52.017
I know. I'm coming with you.

332
00:30:52.018 --> 00:30:53.185
No, you're not.

333
00:30:53.186 --> 00:30:55.145
- Give me the vest.
- No.

334
00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:57.898
Give me the vest now.

335
00:30:57.899 --> 00:31:00.609
I'm coming with you.

336
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.778
- I want to go with you.
- Abby.

337
00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:04.613
I don't want to stay here
with Max. -Abby, stop.

338
00:31:04.614 --> 00:31:06.448
- Hello? -Abby, stop.
- No! You can't make me.

339
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.825
- Yes, I can.
- No, it's mine.

340
00:31:07.826 --> 00:31:09.034
Hello?

341
00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:10.828
Let go!

342
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:12.788
- Let go. No, no.
- Abby, stop. Abby.

343
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:15.249
- He's taking my vest!
- Abby.

344
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.750
- I'm keeping it.
- No.

345
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:21.839
She's all yours.

346
00:32:23.151 --> 00:32:25.070
Garrett!

347
00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:34.244
Wait, please.

348
00:32:34.245 --> 00:32:37.581
Please don't-don't...
don't run.

349
00:32:37.582 --> 00:32:40.710
Okay? I-I just want to know
what you saw.

350
00:32:45.382 --> 00:32:48.467
Please. I'm begging you.

351
00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:50.303
Help me.

352
00:32:54.849 --> 00:32:56.601
Who took Garrett?!

353
00:34:10.675 --> 00:34:12.051
About time.

354
00:34:12.052 --> 00:34:15.679
Starting to think maybe
you fell asleep on the job.

355
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.889
Um...

356
00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:19.433
Can I, help you, Officer?

357
00:34:19.434 --> 00:34:22.102
Please, my name's Vanessa.

358
00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:24.646
And you must be?

359
00:34:24.647 --> 00:34:26.565
Um...

360
00:34:26.566 --> 00:34:29.277
- The new security guard.
- Yeah.

361
00:34:30.862 --> 00:34:33.198
You're bleeding, by the way.

362
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:38.535
Looks nasty.

363
00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:42.165
Come on. I know where they keep
the first aid kit.

364
00:34:52.634 --> 00:34:55.177
Love what
you've done with the place.

365
00:34:55.178 --> 00:34:57.097
Why Nebraska?

366
00:34:57.847 --> 00:35:00.684
- You need a hand?
- I'm fine.

367
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:02.976
You sure?

368
00:35:02.977 --> 00:35:04.269
Here.

369
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.105
I'm a certified EMT.

370
00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:09.693
So if your heart ever goes out,
I'm the one you want to call.

371
00:35:11.986 --> 00:35:14.071
You seem to really know
your way around the place.

372
00:35:14.072 --> 00:35:16.115
Well, Freddy's is on my beat.

373
00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:18.493
I like to stay well-informed.

374
00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:23.331
Also, I really loved this place
as a kid.

375
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.168
There.

376
00:35:28.169 --> 00:35:30.505
That should do it.

377
00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:33.341
Vanessa Shelly.

378
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:35.592
Mike.

379
00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:37.846
Pleasure to meet you, Mike.

380
00:35:43.935 --> 00:35:46.855
You doing all right
this evening, Mike?

381
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:49.648
What?

382
00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:51.400
Are you good? Are you okay?

383
00:35:51.401 --> 00:35:52.943
Is everything copacetic?

384
00:35:52.944 --> 00:35:55.946
Yeah, I know
what "all right" means.

385
00:35:55.947 --> 00:35:57.531
Do you also know that
your eyes are bloodshot

386
00:35:57.532 --> 00:35:58.949
and your heart rate's
through the roof?

387
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.326
And aside from
that gash on your arm,

388
00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:02.995
which...
let's be honest,

389
00:36:02.996 --> 00:36:06.123
is pretty frickin' bizarre,
you've been acting suspicious

390
00:36:06.124 --> 00:36:07.876
since the moment
you opened the door.

391
00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:13.673
Yeah, look,
it's been a weird night.

392
00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:20.513
Sounds like Freddy's.

393
00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:26.227
This place, it gets to people.

394
00:36:26.978 --> 00:36:29.104
It's one of the reasons why
you're gonna quit.

395
00:36:29.105 --> 00:36:30.856
I'm sorry?

396
00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:31.982
Yeah.

397
00:36:31.983 --> 00:36:34.903
You security hires,
you never last.

398
00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:40.450
Have you met them yet?

399
00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:43.453
Met who?

400
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.669
So, what are the other reasons?

401
00:36:52.754 --> 00:36:54.213
Why you think
I'm gonna quit my job.

402
00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:55.506
Well, you tell me.

403
00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:57.549
Is this somewhere
you see yourself

404
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.635
ten, 20 years from now?

405
00:36:59.636 --> 00:37:02.221
I mean, what do I know?
Maybe the benefits are great.

406
00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:04.932
I didn't think so.

407
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:07.936
Add to that the thing
with those kids going missing.

408
00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:11.563
Wh-What did you just say?

409
00:37:11.564 --> 00:37:14.108
Prepare to have your mind blown.

410
00:37:40.593 --> 00:37:42.678
This... this is...

411
00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:45.097
The best thing you've seen
in your entire life?

412
00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:06.494
Maybe some other time.

413
00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:12.291
Wait, y-you said
some kids went missing?

414
00:38:12.292 --> 00:38:14.585
Sure. Back in the '80s.

415
00:38:14.586 --> 00:38:15.919
What happened to them?

416
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.297
It was big news.

417
00:38:18.298 --> 00:38:20.508
That's why the place shut down.

418
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:22.676
Wow.

419
00:38:22.677 --> 00:38:24.721
You really didn't do
your homework, did you?

420
00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:29.017
And you're not even
wearing your badge.

421
00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:32.562
Got it.

422
00:38:38.735 --> 00:38:40.110
There.

423
00:38:40.111 --> 00:38:42.654
Now you're official.

424
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.496
Hey.

425
00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:51.830
Some friendly advice?

426
00:38:51.831 --> 00:38:54.416
Don't let this place get to you.

427
00:38:54.417 --> 00:38:57.045
Just do your job,
and you'll be fine.

428
00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:02.050
Yeah, sounds good.

429
00:39:25.031 --> 00:39:27.032
It's showtime.

430
00:39:27.033 --> 00:39:30.661
As soon as he gets back,
get the guys and meet me here.

431
00:39:30.662 --> 00:39:34.082
I think I see a way in.

432
00:39:47.262 --> 00:39:49.471
All right.

433
00:39:49.472 --> 00:39:51.724
Now, be quick but thorough.

434
00:39:51.725 --> 00:39:54.102
Maximum damage, minimum time.

435
00:39:55.937 --> 00:39:57.813
You see anything valuable,
grab it,

436
00:39:57.814 --> 00:39:59.898
and we'll, settle up after.

437
00:39:59.899 --> 00:40:01.734
- Good?
- Yeah. Golden.

438
00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:03.569
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

439
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.112
- Let's go, boys!
- Come on!

440
00:41:55.432 --> 00:41:56.725
Carl?

441
00:42:20.832 --> 00:42:22.125
Hank?

442
00:42:23.084 --> 00:42:25.461
What the hell are you doing?

443
00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:36.263
Hank?

444
00:42:36.264 --> 00:42:37.514
- Hank!
- Jeff?

445
00:42:39.726 --> 00:42:40.977
Jeff!

446
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:44.646
Come on, you stupid...

447
00:42:44.647 --> 00:42:45.940
Hank?

448
00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:49.277
Come on. Come on.

449
00:43:12.258 --> 00:43:13.717
Hank?

450
00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:04.810
Shit.

451
00:44:10.817 --> 00:44:14.195
No! No! No!

452
00:45:15.757 --> 00:45:17.759
Jeff?

453
00:45:19.469 --> 00:45:20.678
Carl?

454
00:45:27.602 --> 00:45:28.852
Hey.

455
00:45:28.853 --> 00:45:30.604
Follow me.

456
00:45:30.605 --> 00:45:32.815
Hey!

457
00:45:32.816 --> 00:45:33.899
Hey, wait!

458
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.194
Come on.

459
00:45:39.114 --> 00:45:40.782
Hello?

460
00:45:45.412 --> 00:45:47.789
This way.

461
00:46:15.483 --> 00:46:17.359
Warmer.

462
00:46:21.573 --> 00:46:24.993
How in the heck?

463
00:46:29.998 --> 00:46:32.000
Warmer.

464
00:47:03.323 --> 00:47:06.658
It's feeding
time for the giraffe.

465
00:47:13.958 --> 00:47:16.461
Hey, Abs, what you working on?

466
00:47:19.756 --> 00:47:21.048
All right.

467
00:47:21.049 --> 00:47:23.885
I guess you don't
want this, then.

468
00:47:28.973 --> 00:47:30.892
It's cool?

469
00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:38.066
Okay.

470
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.366
I'm trying my best, Abby, okay?

471
00:48:06.177 --> 00:48:07.720
Can't you read?

472
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:10.265
You okay?

473
00:48:11.558 --> 00:48:14.059
I made a mess.

474
00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.687
I'm sorry.

475
00:48:16.604 --> 00:48:19.189
They're just...
they're just papers, all right?

476
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:21.108
They don't...
they don't mean anything.

477
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:23.235
Then why do you have them?

478
00:48:23.236 --> 00:48:26.030
Well, that's complicated.
Aunt Jane...

479
00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:27.406
I hate her.

480
00:48:27.407 --> 00:48:29.742
She's mean
and she smells like cigarettes.

481
00:48:31.453 --> 00:48:32.995
It's not funny.

482
00:48:32.996 --> 00:48:35.247
You're right, it's not.
It's just...

483
00:48:35.248 --> 00:48:36.874
I don't know, it's nice that

484
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:39.209
we can finally agree
about something.

485
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.004
Are you gonna give me away?

486
00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:44.299
Abs, no, I...

487
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:50.471
Hey. Vanessa.

488
00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:52.139
Hey, Mike.

489
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.016
And hello.

490
00:48:54.017 --> 00:48:56.685
Vanessa, this is Abby.
Abby, Vanessa.

491
00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:59.188
Hi, Abby.

492
00:48:59.189 --> 00:49:01.648
Mike didn't tell me
he had a daughter.

493
00:49:01.649 --> 00:49:03.567
- Gross.
- No, Abby's my sister.

494
00:49:03.568 --> 00:49:06.904
Well, he didn't tell me
he had a sister either.

495
00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:09.448
Are you here to arrest Mike?

496
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:11.700
Okay, can you
go play in your room

497
00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:13.744
so me and Vanessa can talk?

498
00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:15.163
It's nice to meet you.

499
00:49:16.998 --> 00:49:20.125
What, um...
what are you doing here?

500
00:49:20.126 --> 00:49:22.961
- Somebody broke into Freddy's.
- What?

501
00:49:22.962 --> 00:49:24.880
Wh-What-what happened?

502
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:27.258
Recognize these?

503
00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:30.344
Look, it's not
what you think, okay?

504
00:49:30.345 --> 00:49:32.304
Th-Those are...
They're sleeping pills.

505
00:49:32.305 --> 00:49:34.014
- They help me sleep.
- I know what they are, Mike.

506
00:49:34.015 --> 00:49:35.350
It's written on the bottle.

507
00:49:36.685 --> 00:49:38.644
If you're too whacked out

508
00:49:38.645 --> 00:49:40.187
to remember to lock
a friggin' door,

509
00:49:40.188 --> 00:49:42.398
accident or not, you're liable.

510
00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:44.233
It's called criminal negligence.

511
00:49:44.234 --> 00:49:46.652
You wouldn't understand.

512
00:49:46.653 --> 00:49:48.195
Well, then help me.

513
00:49:48.196 --> 00:49:50.239
'Cause the moment
I file that report,

514
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.034
it's out of my hands.

515
00:49:57.038 --> 00:49:59.374
You want to take a walk?

516
00:50:03.044 --> 00:50:05.755
So I used to have a brother.

517
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.051
His name was Garrett.

518
00:50:11.386 --> 00:50:13.846
And when I was...

519
00:50:13.847 --> 00:50:16.348
about 12,

520
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.768
he was, he was taken.

521
00:50:20.145 --> 00:50:22.480
And I was there
when it happened.

522
00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:26.025
They never found
the guy who did it,

523
00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:27.652
and they never found my brother.

524
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:36.994
So there's this theory that,
we can't forget things.

525
00:50:36.995 --> 00:50:39.997
Basically, it says that
every single thing that you see

526
00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:42.791
in your entire life,
down to the tiniest of details,

527
00:50:42.792 --> 00:50:44.710
gets stored inside of you.

528
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:48.047
You just have to know
how to look.

529
00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:50.215
Your brother...

530
00:50:50.216 --> 00:50:52.343
You think you saw who took him?

531
00:50:52.344 --> 00:50:54.345
I know I did.

532
00:50:54.346 --> 00:50:56.847
And I know that he's in here,
but he's just... he's...

533
00:50:56.848 --> 00:50:58.057
It's buried.

534
00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.059
So every night, I dream,

535
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.477
and I go back
to that same memory,

536
00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:03.729
and I-I search for details.

537
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:06.649
For any little thing
that got overlooked.

538
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:14.031
Yeah.

539
00:51:14.032 --> 00:51:16.576
And that's usually the part
where people tell me I'm crazy.

540
00:51:18.745 --> 00:51:20.788
I know what crazy
looks like, Mike.

541
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:22.748
This isn't it.

542
00:51:22.749 --> 00:51:24.793
Not even close.

543
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:28.337
And these?

544
00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:30.714
I mean, going back
to the same dream,

545
00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:32.424
the same place
night after night,

546
00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:35.094
it's not easy,
so the-the pills help.

547
00:51:35.095 --> 00:51:36.345
Some other things,

548
00:51:36.346 --> 00:51:38.263
like familiar sights,
familiar sounds.

549
00:51:38.264 --> 00:51:39.932
"Pining for fun?"

550
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:43.894
"Visit Nebraska."

551
00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:46.480
Your sister seems cool.

552
00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:49.024
So it's just the two of you?

553
00:51:49.025 --> 00:51:50.901
Yeah.

554
00:51:50.902 --> 00:51:53.445
Yeah, it's just us.

555
00:51:53.446 --> 00:51:56.616
Our mom died
a little while back.

556
00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:01.329
And Dad,
he couldn't handle it, so...

557
00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:04.581
You know what's crazy is,

558
00:52:04.582 --> 00:52:06.625
when... when Garrett and I
were kids,

559
00:52:06.626 --> 00:52:09.294
they were like
those perfect parents

560
00:52:09.295 --> 00:52:11.339
you'd see on old TV shows.

561
00:52:13.008 --> 00:52:16.301
Yeah, ev-every night,
we would sit down together,

562
00:52:16.302 --> 00:52:17.845
we'd have family dinner,

563
00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:20.640
and we'd hold hands
and say grace, and...

564
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.392
That actually sounds
really nice.

565
00:52:23.393 --> 00:52:28.356
Yeah, at the time,
I thought it was really cheesy.

566
00:52:31.026 --> 00:52:32.944
But then it's gone.

567
00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:40.952
You and Abby,
you still have each other.

568
00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:45.623
From where I sit,
I'd say you're lucky.

569
00:52:50.503 --> 00:52:52.839
I should go.

570
00:52:56.968 --> 00:52:59.470
No more sleeping on the job.

571
00:52:59.471 --> 00:53:02.349
When you're at Freddy's,
you stay alert.

572
00:53:05.602 --> 00:53:07.019
<i>Hey, it's Max.</i>

573
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.147
<i>Leave a message. Or don't.</i>

574
00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:16.237
Come on, Max. Come on.

575
00:53:17.739 --> 00:53:20.241
Hey, it's Max. Leave a mes...

576
00:53:30.168 --> 00:53:31.669
<i>I will work,</i>

577
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.587
and you will sleep,
and under no circumstances

578
00:53:33.588 --> 00:53:34.922
are you gonna come out
of my office.

579
00:53:34.923 --> 00:53:36.799
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

580
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.135
This is not a vacation, okay?
You're not here to have fun.

581
00:53:40.136 --> 00:53:41.720
Okay.

582
00:53:41.721 --> 00:53:43.764
Whoa, slow down, slow down,
slow down. -No, no, no.

583
00:53:43.765 --> 00:53:44.932
Abby?

584
00:53:51.022 --> 00:53:52.940
Whoa.

585
00:53:52.941 --> 00:53:55.944
What happened?

586
00:53:58.196 --> 00:53:59.863
Give me your hand.

587
00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:01.115
Watch out.

588
00:54:02.992 --> 00:54:06.037
Do you want me
to turn the light off?

589
00:54:07.956 --> 00:54:09.289
Okay.

590
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.292
Good night.

591
00:54:12.544 --> 00:54:14.462
It's like camping.

592
00:56:12.914 --> 00:56:14.749
Abby?

593
00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:32.558
I'll be right back.

594
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.824
Hello?

595
00:56:53.121 --> 00:56:55.456
I know you're back there.

596
00:56:55.457 --> 00:56:57.751
Might as well come out.

597
00:57:25.653 --> 00:57:27.906
You're those kids, right?

598
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.537
The ones who disappeared?

599
00:57:38.667 --> 00:57:40.919
Look.

600
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:47.257
I don't know how it's possible
that you're here

601
00:57:47.258 --> 00:57:49.678
like this in my dream, but...

602
00:57:52.389 --> 00:57:54.181
I need your help.

603
00:57:54.182 --> 00:57:56.059
Please.

604
00:57:57.727 --> 00:58:00.271
Help me remember
the man who took my brother.

605
00:58:04.859 --> 00:58:07.319
If we show you,

606
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.197
what will you give us?

607
00:58:10.198 --> 00:58:11.949
Anything.

608
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.202
I'll give you anything you want.

609
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.932
Abby?

610
00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:41.645
Stop! Stop! Stop!

611
00:58:41.646 --> 00:58:43.230
Abby?

612
00:58:54.826 --> 00:58:56.410
Mike.

613
00:58:58.121 --> 00:58:59.830
They wouldn't stop tickling me.

614
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.915
I thought I was gonna die.

615
00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:05.711
Freddy,
this is my brother, Mike.

616
00:59:08.798 --> 00:59:10.716
- Abby, what is this?
- Come on.

617
00:59:10.717 --> 00:59:12.594
I want you to meet the others.

618
00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:26.899
Mike, this is Bonnie,

619
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.277
Foxy and Chica.

620
00:59:30.278 --> 00:59:33.072
Everyone,

621
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:34.198
this is Mike.

622
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.537
This-this is a joke, right?

623
00:59:40.538 --> 00:59:42.915
I mean, th-there's someone here.

624
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:45.709
There's probably somebody
controlling them, right?

625
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.170
I mean...

626
00:59:49.464 --> 00:59:51.423
Okay, good joke!

627
00:59:51.424 --> 00:59:53.509
Congratulations! You got me!

628
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.637
You can come out now!

629
00:59:58.306 --> 00:59:59.641
Hello?

630
01:00:05.772 --> 01:00:07.356
It's okay, Mike.

631
01:00:07.357 --> 01:00:09.275
They just want to play.

632
01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:14.906
We have to go home now.
Come on. -Hold on.

633
01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.121
They really like pictures.

634
01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:36.969
I had a lot of fun tonight.

635
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.804
Thank you for playing with me.

636
01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:42.099
Okay, okay, Abby, come on.

637
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.977
Okay.

638
01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:55.822
Bye!

639
01:01:17.093 --> 01:01:18.720
There you go.

640
01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:55.757
It's them.

641
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.401
Hey, Abby, um,

642
01:02:15.402 --> 01:02:19.155
we need to talk about
last night, okay?

643
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:22.784
Um...

644
01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.912
So those,
those... machines...

645
01:02:26.913 --> 01:02:29.331
My friends?

646
01:02:29.332 --> 01:02:32.334
Your friends?

647
01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:34.420
Um...

648
01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:36.255
are they...?

649
01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.507
Ghosts?

650
01:02:38.508 --> 01:02:41.135
- Yeah.
- Of course.

651
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:44.055
How else could they make
the robots move?

652
01:02:46.516 --> 01:02:48.600
Right.

653
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:50.311
Can I have some more soup?

654
01:02:52.022 --> 01:02:53.314
Yeah, sure.

655
01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.988
Hey, Abs.

656
01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:03.450
You know we used to have
a brother, right?

657
01:03:04.659 --> 01:03:06.369
Garrett.

658
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.957
I don't... I don't really
talk about him very much.

659
01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:14.543
Neither did Mom or Dad.

660
01:03:14.544 --> 01:03:17.087
Yeah, it was hard for them.

661
01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:20.008
It's hard for me, too.

662
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:35.148
C-Can you explain this to me?

663
01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:39.027
You-you drew that, right?

664
01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:44.491
Okay, and... and-and
you know what that is?

665
01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:48.952
Hey, hey, it's okay.

666
01:03:48.953 --> 01:03:50.496
Okay, I'm not, I'm not mad.

667
01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:52.164
I won't get angry at you.

668
01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:55.293
But I really need you
to help me understand, please.

669
01:03:57.837 --> 01:04:00.882
That's when Garrett got taken.

670
01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:05.261
Abby, who told you about that?

671
01:04:06.513 --> 01:04:09.557
W-Was it a-a boy
with blonde hair?

672
01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:14.895
Did that boy
ever tell you anything

673
01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:17.481
about the man driving that car?

674
01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:19.024
Anything at all?

675
01:04:19.025 --> 01:04:21.444
Okay, just think,
think really hard, okay?

676
01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:28.118
No.

677
01:04:29.619 --> 01:04:32.539
All they talk about
is a yellow rabbit.

678
01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:35.583
Okay.

679
01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:38.502
But...

680
01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:40.046
I can ask.

681
01:04:41.464 --> 01:04:43.925
I would really appreciate that.

682
01:05:26.217 --> 01:05:27.843
Vanessa's here.

683
01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:29.178
Yeah.

684
01:05:29.179 --> 01:05:31.430
My friends talk about her sometimes.

685
01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:34.308
- What do they say?
- That she's nice.

686
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:36.977
Abby, if I asked you
to wait in the car, would you?

687
01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:38.563
No.

688
01:05:39.522 --> 01:05:40.814
Abby, wait.

689
01:05:40.815 --> 01:05:42.316
- Guys, I'm back.
- Abby.

690
01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:45.110
- Hey, Vanessa.
- Abby.

691
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.407
- Mike.
- Vanessa.

692
01:05:50.408 --> 01:05:53.578
I missed you guys.

693
01:05:55.163 --> 01:05:56.998
You knew about this.

694
01:06:00.418 --> 01:06:01.710
Guess you figured it out.

695
01:06:01.711 --> 01:06:04.963
Ghost children
possessing giant robots?

696
01:06:04.964 --> 01:06:06.965
Thanks for the heads-up.

697
01:06:06.966 --> 01:06:09.052
Guys, we need help.

698
01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:14.056
It needs to be big

699
01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:16.351
so we can all fit inside.

700
01:06:20.689 --> 01:06:22.856
Abby, look.

701
01:06:22.857 --> 01:06:25.317
Now, this is all really fun
and exciting,

702
01:06:25.318 --> 01:06:27.528
but these things are big,
and they could be dangerous,

703
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:29.822
so I think we need to lay
some ground rules, all right?

704
01:06:29.823 --> 01:06:31.908
Vanessa, what do you think?

705
01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:36.328
I think we could use the tables
for the fort.

706
01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:39.665
Everyone, follow me.

707
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:41.583
Come on.

708
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:06.900
It needs to be higher.

709
01:07:12.782 --> 01:07:14.241
You did it!

710
01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:19.872
Are you okay?

711
01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:25.294
I like it in here.

712
01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:28.297
Me, too.

713
01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:31.343
But I think
it's gonna rain soon.

714
01:07:33.428 --> 01:07:36.180
Sounds like we need a roof.

715
01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:38.391
I'll go see what I can find.

716
01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.645
I'll...
I'll-I'll come with you.

717
01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:46.190
Abby, don't forget to ask.

718
01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:48.067
- Okay.
- Yeah.

719
01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.071
What are you looking for
exactly?

720
01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:53.864
Tablecloths.

721
01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:56.658
They used to keep 'em back here
for big events.

722
01:07:56.659 --> 01:07:59.746
Right. And remind me
how you know that.

723
01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:04.125
Found 'em.

724
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:16.428
Don't.

725
01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:18.263
I wouldn't do that.

726
01:08:18.264 --> 01:08:19.723
They're spring locks.

727
01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:21.767
They're on all the older models.

728
01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:23.686
They were designed
to keep the animatronic parts

729
01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:27.648
in place so that, a person
could safely wear the suit.

730
01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:30.693
They tend to be pretty unstable.

731
01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:31.820
Let's see.

732
01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.572
Ooh.

733
01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:39.327
Like I said, unstable.

734
01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:44.957
Is there anything else that you
want to tell me about, Vanessa?

735
01:08:44.958 --> 01:08:48.085
'Cause you seem to know
everything about this place.

736
01:08:48.086 --> 01:08:49.169
And what if Abby'd come in here?

737
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.629
What if she'd found that thing?

738
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.465
You're the one who brought her,
Mike, not me.

739
01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:56.511
What I can't wrap
my head around is why.

740
01:08:59.347 --> 01:09:01.515
All right, look.

741
01:09:01.516 --> 01:09:04.853
I think that they know
who took my little brother.

742
01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.813
I can't explain it,
but when I'm here,

743
01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:09.273
I feel closer to Garrett.

744
01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:10.816
My dreams are more vivid,
and it...

745
01:09:10.817 --> 01:09:12.818
it's like I can almost...

746
01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:14.863
Change what happened?

747
01:09:21.202 --> 01:09:23.037
Did you ask them about this?

748
01:09:23.038 --> 01:09:24.455
Yeah, I tried.

749
01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:27.709
I don't think
they like me very much.

750
01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:30.211
But...

751
01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:33.672
they do like Abby.

752
01:09:33.673 --> 01:09:37.009
Mike, you need to drop this.

753
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.886
I don't really see how
that's any of your business.

754
01:09:38.887 --> 01:09:41.890
I'm telling you,
you need to let it go.

755
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:45.268
Who the hell are you?

756
01:09:46.436 --> 01:09:49.021
Just someone
who's trying to help.

757
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:03.035
Vanessa, wait.

758
01:10:04.496 --> 01:10:06.330
- Talk to me.
- I'm trying.

759
01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:07.664
You're not listening.

760
01:10:07.665 --> 01:10:09.333
Please.
Finding the guy that did this

761
01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:11.085
is the only thing
that matters to me.

762
01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:16.256
Abby?

763
01:10:16.257 --> 01:10:18.677
Wait. Abby, don't!

764
01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.267
Abby?

765
01:10:27.268 --> 01:10:30.312
Abby? Abby!

766
01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:38.112
- What happened?
- It's okay, Abby.

767
01:10:38.113 --> 01:10:40.072
You just had an accident.

768
01:10:40.073 --> 01:10:42.409
You're okay.

769
01:10:45.203 --> 01:10:47.329
I'm so sorry.

770
01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:54.420
I don't know what to say.

771
01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:57.047
Just go home, Mike.

772
01:10:57.048 --> 01:10:58.633
Take care of your sister.

773
01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:02.971
What are you so afraid of?

774
01:11:04.305 --> 01:11:06.682
In the storage room...

775
01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:09.477
I saw your eyes.
You were terrified.

776
01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:17.443
You can do whatever you want
with your own life,

777
01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:20.029
but if you ever bring Abby
back here again,

778
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:22.323
I will shoot you.

779
01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:34.126
She looked so angry.

780
01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:37.964
Why does everyone always
look at you that way?

781
01:11:57.692 --> 01:12:00.319
Hey, it's Mike.

782
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.321
I need your help.

783
01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:15.960
Abby.

784
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.712
Is that bacon?

785
01:12:18.713 --> 01:12:20.005
Hey, why don't you, get dressed

786
01:12:20.006 --> 01:12:21.507
and then come
to the kitchen, okay?

787
01:12:21.508 --> 01:12:22.966
I want to talk to you
about something.

788
01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:24.636
Okay.

789
01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:33.061
Wow, there's my favorite
little girl.

790
01:12:34.604 --> 01:12:36.398
Come have a seat, all right?

791
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:38.857
What did you do?

792
01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:40.651
Abby, look, I think
if you just sit down,

793
01:12:40.652 --> 01:12:42.861
we can explain it to you, okay?

794
01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:44.196
No.

795
01:12:44.197 --> 01:12:46.615
I promise you, this is not
what you think it is.

796
01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:49.368
I hate you.

797
01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:51.579
I hate you, Mike!

798
01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:57.836
Well, I-I think that went well.

799
01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:12.683
She reminds me of you, you know.

800
01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:15.394
Always with the temper.

801
01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.687
Well, look, when she calms down,

802
01:13:16.688 --> 01:13:18.480
can you, um, tell her
that I'm sorry

803
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.150
and that I'll-I'll be back soon?

804
01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:25.195
Well, Mike,
there's a larger conversation

805
01:13:25.196 --> 01:13:27.114
that needs to happen here.

806
01:13:27.115 --> 01:13:29.491
So when you do get back,
you and me are gonna have

807
01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:31.160
a little chat.

808
01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.121
Okay.

809
01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:51.013
You know what works for me?

810
01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:54.058
A warm glass of milk
with chamomile and honey.

811
01:13:54.059 --> 01:13:55.935
I tell you...

812
01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.648
What an asshole.

813
01:14:54.953 --> 01:14:57.079
Okay, enough games, you two.

814
01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.747
Emergency landing.

815
01:14:58.748 --> 01:15:00.582
Coming in.

816
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.752
Hey, buddy.

817
01:15:03.837 --> 01:15:05.462
Well, don't just stand there.
Dig in.

818
01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:12.971
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

819
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:16.724
This... this isn't...

820
01:15:16.725 --> 01:15:19.019
this isn't how it happened.

821
01:15:20.061 --> 01:15:21.520
This isn't real.

822
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.023
But it could be.

823
01:15:24.315 --> 01:15:26.859
What is this?

824
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.527
This isn't what I asked for.

825
01:15:28.528 --> 01:15:30.821
But it's what you want.

826
01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:34.366
No. I just, I just want
to find the man that...

827
01:15:34.367 --> 01:15:35.701
You're lying.

828
01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:37.703
You want to save Garrett.

829
01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:39.663
That's why you're really here.

830
01:15:39.664 --> 01:15:42.166
To change what happened.

831
01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.625
To go back.

832
01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.754
But I can't.

833
01:15:46.963 --> 01:15:48.589
He's gone. They're all gone.

834
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:50.759
Really?

835
01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:02.644
You can have this dream
every night.

836
01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:04.646
You can be together
with him again.

837
01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:07.232
Like before.

838
01:16:07.233 --> 01:16:08.984
How?

839
01:16:08.985 --> 01:16:12.614
You said we could have
anything we wanted.

840
01:16:13.406 --> 01:16:17.285
We want Abby.

841
01:16:19.454 --> 01:16:21.331
Abby?

842
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:29.172
They love her, Mike,
and she loves them.

843
01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:33.425
You've seen her with them.

844
01:16:33.426 --> 01:16:36.179
You've seen how happy she is.

845
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:42.267
It's time to let her go, sweetheart.

846
01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:46.147
You were never the right person
to take care of her.

847
01:16:58.326 --> 01:17:00.954
Okay.

848
01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:06.918
Yes.

849
01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:13.758
You're home.

850
01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:31.026
No.

851
01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:34.361
No, this is wrong.

852
01:17:34.362 --> 01:17:37.198
I don't, I don't want this. Listen...

853
01:17:49.794 --> 01:17:52.046
I made a mistake!

854
01:17:52.047 --> 01:17:54.590
Please, I don't want this!

855
01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:56.300
Do you hear me?!

856
01:17:59.679 --> 01:18:01.639
You leave Abby alone!

857
01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:08.520
Abby.

858
01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:10.105
Abby.

859
01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:12.442
Stay away from my sister!

860
01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.405
Abby.

861
01:18:19.824 --> 01:18:21.867
- Abby.
- Abby.

862
01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:27.832
Abby.

863
01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.379
Abby. Abby.

864
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.298
Abby. Abby. Abby.

865
01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:42.305
Abby.

866
01:19:54.836 --> 01:19:57.505
No!

867
01:20:04.095 --> 01:20:06.305
Abby?

868
01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:09.351
You can't stay in there
forever, you know.

869
01:20:14.397 --> 01:20:15.899
Suit yourself.

870
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.658
The pottery that grows.

871
01:20:26.659 --> 01:20:28.077
It's easy.

872
01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:29.870
Soak your Chia overnight,
spread the seeds...

873
01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:49.682
Freddy?

874
01:20:57.065 --> 01:20:59.526
Not Freddy.

875
01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.696
They're all waiting for you.

876
01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:05.323
It's time to go play.

877
01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:15.040
Silly Aunt Jane.

878
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.584
She fell asleep.

879
01:21:19.087 --> 01:21:20.713
How do we get there?

880
01:21:29.889 --> 01:21:32.266
Where to, little lady?

881
01:21:34.769 --> 01:21:36.271
What the...?

882
01:21:36.813 --> 01:21:38.606
My goodness!

883
01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:44.278
Not cool.

884
01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:47.032
Why do I always get the weirdos?

885
01:22:01.338 --> 01:22:02.963
Careful.

886
01:22:02.964 --> 01:22:05.341
I managed to stop the bleeding,

887
01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:07.426
but you're probably
gonna need stitches.

888
01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:09.011
Where are we?

889
01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:11.305
Police supply outpost.

890
01:22:11.306 --> 01:22:15.893
I found you, and, you were...

891
01:22:15.894 --> 01:22:17.562
you were badly hurt.

892
01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:23.109
They tried to kill me, Vanessa.

893
01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.156
But I'm guessing
you already knew that.

894
01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.661
Max.

895
01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:36.288
Her brother.

896
01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.833
You knew about them, too, right?

897
01:22:39.584 --> 01:22:42.044
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

898
01:22:42.045 --> 01:22:43.879
Yeah.

899
01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.048
More complicated than

900
01:22:46.049 --> 01:22:48.008
possessed robots
murdering innocent people?

901
01:22:48.009 --> 01:22:49.968
They weren't innocent.

902
01:22:49.969 --> 01:22:51.471
Yeah, Abby is!

903
01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:55.224
Mike... -You saw Abby
playing with them.

904
01:22:55.225 --> 01:22:56.809
And you knew
what they were capable of,

905
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:58.977
- and you didn't say anything!
- Mike, please just...

906
01:22:58.978 --> 01:23:00.688
Abby is in danger!

907
01:23:00.689 --> 01:23:03.358
Tell me what happened.

908
01:23:05.568 --> 01:23:07.404
In my dream...

909
01:23:08.905 --> 01:23:11.740
they asked me for Abby.

910
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:13.493
And I said yes.

911
01:23:14.536 --> 01:23:18.123
It was a mistake,
and I-I tried to fix it, but...

912
01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:22.669
What do they want
with my sister?

913
01:23:25.213 --> 01:23:28.632
They want to make her like them.

914
01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:40.729
Come on, let's go.

915
01:23:53.992 --> 01:23:56.244
Where'd you go?

916
01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:05.754
<i>In the '80s,
when those kids went missing...</i>

917
01:24:06.588 --> 01:24:08.380
the police searched Freddy's
from top to bottom.

918
01:24:08.381 --> 01:24:11.760
Every inch was accounted for.

919
01:24:13.928 --> 01:24:16.264
<i>But they never found them.</i>

920
01:24:22.979 --> 01:24:24.731
Hello?

921
01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:30.903
<i>The man who took them,</i>

922
01:24:30.904 --> 01:24:32.781
<i>he was a...</i>

923
01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:37.118
<i>He was a very bad man.</i>

924
01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:40.663
A very cruel man.

925
01:24:41.539 --> 01:24:44.375
Also a very clever man.

926
01:24:44.376 --> 01:24:46.251
<i>He knew that parents would cry,</i>

927
01:24:46.252 --> 01:24:47.961
<i>and the police
would come looking.</i>

928
01:24:47.962 --> 01:24:49.797
<i>And he knew there's one place</i>

929
01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:52.550
<i>they'd never think to check
because...</i>-

930
01:24:54.344 --> 01:24:56.179
why would they?

931
01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:01.643
<i>I mean, why would anyone?</i>

932
01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:14.155
It's not just their ghosts that
are inside of those machines.

933
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.372
It's their bodies.

934
01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:27.292
You have to understand, the...

935
01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:30.129
the kids, they don't want
to hurt anyone.

936
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:31.380
It's-it's him.

937
01:25:31.381 --> 01:25:34.591
He influences them somehow.

938
01:25:34.592 --> 01:25:38.846
He took everything from them,
but they don't remember.

939
01:25:38.847 --> 01:25:41.390
Who, Vanessa?

940
01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:44.226
I tried to warn you.

941
01:25:44.227 --> 01:25:47.355
I really did try in my own way.

942
01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:49.606
But it's too late now.

943
01:25:49.607 --> 01:25:51.901
He knows that
you're looking for him.

944
01:25:53.903 --> 01:25:56.071
He'll be coming.

945
01:25:56.072 --> 01:26:00.702
You need to tell me who he is.

946
01:26:08.209 --> 01:26:12.714
His name is William Afton.

947
01:26:15.383 --> 01:26:17.886
He's my father.

948
01:26:36.738 --> 01:26:38.947
You knew?

949
01:26:38.948 --> 01:26:40.366
Mike...

950
01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:42.201
This whole time.

951
01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:44.078
My brother, you knew.

952
01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:46.205
Not about Garrett, no.

953
01:26:46.206 --> 01:26:48.874
A-At least...

954
01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:50.418
not when we met.

955
01:26:54.964 --> 01:26:57.049
I'm so, so sorry.

956
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:59.009
Tell me how to stop them.

957
01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.929
Tell me how to save my sister!

958
01:27:16.027 --> 01:27:18.947
Electricity.
Electricity is the key.

959
01:27:20.115 --> 01:27:23.326
We use these for
animal control. -

960
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.662
There's a Taser on your belt.

961
01:27:26.663 --> 01:27:28.747
It won't do permanent damage,

962
01:27:28.748 --> 01:27:31.250
but it'll mess with
the animatronic circuitry.

963
01:27:31.251 --> 01:27:32.794
Hopefully buy you some time.

964
01:27:34.295 --> 01:27:36.548
Come with me.

965
01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:39.091
No.

966
01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:42.803
Vanessa, you owe it to me,
and you owe it to them.

967
01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:44.430
No, I can't.

968
01:27:44.431 --> 01:27:46.474
If he's there, I...

969
01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:50.687
I won't be any use to you,
believe me.

970
01:27:52.981 --> 01:27:55.483
He really messed you up,
didn't he?

971
01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:02.781
Take these.

972
01:28:14.044 --> 01:28:16.628
<i>You need to avoid
the front entrance.</i>

973
01:28:24.596 --> 01:28:25.971
<i>There's an outlet vent</i>

974
01:28:25.972 --> 01:28:27.389
<i>on the east side
of the building.</i>

975
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:29.893
<i>That's the best way inside.</i>

976
01:28:46.326 --> 01:28:48.577
No.

977
01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:36.584
Abby.

978
01:29:45.927 --> 01:29:48.554
Chica, where are we going?

979
01:30:20.295 --> 01:30:24.049
Chica, I don't like this.

980
01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:31.555
Let go of me!

981
01:30:31.556 --> 01:30:32.556
Abby?!

982
01:30:36.478 --> 01:30:37.936
Chica, let me go.

983
01:30:37.937 --> 01:30:39.731
Hey!

984
01:30:42.692 --> 01:30:43.985
Leave her alone!

985
01:30:55.288 --> 01:30:56.330
Mike.

986
01:30:56.331 --> 01:30:57.790
Hey.

987
01:30:57.791 --> 01:30:59.124
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

988
01:30:59.125 --> 01:31:00.918
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

989
01:31:00.919 --> 01:31:03.003
I don't know why
she was trying to hurt me.

990
01:31:03.004 --> 01:31:05.172
I know. I know.

991
01:31:05.173 --> 01:31:07.633
Hey, Abby, listen to me.

992
01:31:07.634 --> 01:31:10.886
I've been an idiot
about so many things.

993
01:31:10.887 --> 01:31:13.138
I've been stuck
trying to fix the past,

994
01:31:13.139 --> 01:31:15.933
but you are the most important
thing in the world to me,

995
01:31:15.934 --> 01:31:17.643
and I promise you
I'm gonna do better.

996
01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:19.561
I love you, too, Mike.

997
01:31:19.562 --> 01:31:21.313
But we should probably go now.

998
01:31:21.314 --> 01:31:22.857
Right, okay. Come on.

999
01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:43.003
Mike!

1000
01:31:44.504 --> 01:31:46.505
Run! Hide! Abby, go!

1001
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:27.606
Abby?

1002
01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:29.818
Abby, where are you?

1003
01:33:32.821 --> 01:33:34.113
Abby?

1004
01:34:36.551 --> 01:34:37.718
- Vanessa.
- It's okay.

1005
01:34:37.719 --> 01:34:39.054
Foxy.

1006
01:34:42.223 --> 01:34:43.640
I need to get you somewhere safe

1007
01:34:43.641 --> 01:34:45.894
so I can go help
your brother, okay?

1008
01:34:47.103 --> 01:34:50.439
You couldn't just
leave it alone, could you?

1009
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.901
Lucky me.

1010
01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:56.945
This is perfect.

1011
01:34:56.946 --> 01:34:59.407
First I killed your brother.

1012
01:35:01.284 --> 01:35:03.035
Now I kill you.

1013
01:35:03.036 --> 01:35:05.454
Symmetry, my friend.

1014
01:35:05.455 --> 01:35:06.538
Go to hell.

1015
01:35:15.131 --> 01:35:18.093
Wake up, children.

1016
01:35:19.928 --> 01:35:23.056
I have something for you
to play with.

1017
01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:29.771
This is gonna be so much fun.

1018
01:35:32.482 --> 01:35:36.985
Little ones tell me
you have a sister.

1019
01:35:36.986 --> 01:35:38.947
She will love it here.

1020
01:35:40.615 --> 01:35:43.575
You, however, are finished.

1021
01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:46.495
Farewell, Michael Schmidt.

1022
01:35:46.496 --> 01:35:48.289
That's enough!

1023
01:35:49.457 --> 01:35:51.667
Drop the knife.

1024
01:35:51.668 --> 01:35:55.921
A little old for temper
tantrums, aren't we, Vanessa?

1025
01:35:55.922 --> 01:35:58.466
I'm not kidding, Dad.

1026
01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:08.892
You may have forgotten your
loyalties, but I assure you,

1027
01:36:08.893 --> 01:36:11.187
they have not.

1028
01:36:12.814 --> 01:36:14.274
Mike!

1029
01:36:16.776 --> 01:36:18.694
Please wake up.

1030
01:36:18.695 --> 01:36:20.612
Now, put that thing away

1031
01:36:20.613 --> 01:36:24.450
and help me clean up the mess
that you created!

1032
01:36:24.451 --> 01:36:25.492
Please.

1033
01:36:25.493 --> 01:36:27.786
Please, Mike. Please. No!

1034
01:36:27.787 --> 01:36:30.414
Come on.

1035
01:36:31.499 --> 01:36:33.792
We both know
you're not gonna use a...

1036
01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.677
Mike. Mike.

1037
01:36:43.678 --> 01:36:45.889
Abby. Abby.

1038
01:36:49.726 --> 01:36:53.062
<i>The Yellow Rabbit,
he controls them.</i>

1039
01:36:53.063 --> 01:36:55.523
The drawings.

1040
01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:59.818
The Yellow Rabbit
hurt your friends.

1041
01:36:59.819 --> 01:37:02.029
Show them what really happened.

1042
01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:08.410
You had one job.

1043
01:37:08.411 --> 01:37:09.787
One.

1044
01:37:09.788 --> 01:37:11.080
Keep him in the dark

1045
01:37:11.081 --> 01:37:13.499
and kill him
if he got too close.

1046
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.334
That's two jobs.

1047
01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.693
- No!
- Let go!

1048
01:37:40.694 --> 01:37:42.444
I won't let you hurt her, too.

1049
01:37:48.326 --> 01:37:49.536
Dad.

1050
01:37:56.793 --> 01:37:58.128
Hey.

1051
01:37:59.004 --> 01:38:00.796
Hey.

1052
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:14.518
What have you done?

1053
01:38:44.132 --> 01:38:46.383
They can see you now.

1054
01:38:46.384 --> 01:38:48.595
They know what you did.

1055
01:38:49.763 --> 01:38:51.513
Move.

1056
01:38:51.514 --> 01:38:52.598
Move!

1057
01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.983
Mike!

1058
01:39:07.072 --> 01:39:09.281
Look at you.

1059
01:39:09.282 --> 01:39:12.659
Look at the nasty things
that you have become.

1060
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.579
Look how small you are,
how worthless you are.

1061
01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:18.165
You are wretched,
rotten little beasts.

1062
01:39:18.166 --> 01:39:19.501
I made you!

1063
01:39:54.369 --> 01:39:56.371
I always come back.

1064
01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:11.218
What is happening?

1065
01:40:11.219 --> 01:40:13.178
The spring locks.

1066
01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:24.357
Okay.

1067
01:40:28.069 --> 01:40:29.903
Come on. Come on.

1068
01:40:29.904 --> 01:40:32.115
Come on.

1069
01:41:04.564 --> 01:41:06.148
- Okay, one more.
- Wait, one more?

1070
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:07.900
- Put one more? One more block?
- Yeah.

1071
01:41:07.901 --> 01:41:10.069
- One more block? -Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Let's do one more.

1072
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:11.487
It's really extraordinary,

1073
01:41:11.488 --> 01:41:14.323
the turn she's taken
these past few weeks.

1074
01:41:14.324 --> 01:41:17.619
Whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

1075
01:41:19.746 --> 01:41:21.748
Yeah, I will.

1076
01:41:24.084 --> 01:41:25.292
<i>It's not that hard.</i>

1077
01:41:25.293 --> 01:41:27.252
What do you want for dinner?

1078
01:41:27.253 --> 01:41:29.506
Pizza or spaghetti?

1079
01:41:30.965 --> 01:41:32.466
Both.

1080
01:41:32.467 --> 01:41:35.594
You got to choose. Which is it?

1081
01:41:35.595 --> 01:41:36.804
But I want both.

1082
01:41:36.805 --> 01:41:39.140
You can't have both.

1083
01:41:40.392 --> 01:41:43.102
Spaghetti with meatballs.

1084
01:41:43.103 --> 01:41:45.313
All right, with meatballs.

1085
01:41:46.731 --> 01:41:49.108
Um, we're gonna make
a quick stop, okay?

1086
01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:03.622
Vanessa, I don't know if...

1087
01:42:03.623 --> 01:42:06.793
you can hear any of this,
but, um...

1088
01:42:09.004 --> 01:42:11.630
I'm having a hard time just

1089
01:42:11.631 --> 01:42:13.757
processing everything
that happened.

1090
01:42:13.758 --> 01:42:17.177
But you were there
for me and Abby

1091
01:42:17.178 --> 01:42:19.179
when it mattered the most.

1092
01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.890
And I don't think that either
of us would be here today

1093
01:42:21.891 --> 01:42:23.810
if it weren't for you.

1094
01:42:26.855 --> 01:42:28.606
So...

1095
01:42:31.151 --> 01:42:32.861
So get better.

1096
01:42:35.238 --> 01:42:37.574
And we'll be here
when you wake up.

1097
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:44.830
<i>Did you tell her I said hi?</i>

1098
01:42:44.831 --> 01:42:46.540
I did.

1099
01:42:46.541 --> 01:42:49.586
All right,
let's get out of here.

1100
01:42:53.506 --> 01:42:55.258
You okay?

1101
01:42:56.384 --> 01:42:57.843
I was just thinking

1102
01:42:57.844 --> 01:43:00.262
about my friends.

1103
01:43:00.263 --> 01:43:01.973
They're all alone.

1104
01:43:03.224 --> 01:43:04.391
Right.

1105
01:43:04.392 --> 01:43:06.936
No one takes care
of them anymore.

1106
01:43:08.396 --> 01:43:11.232
Can we visit them sometime?

1107
01:43:13.943 --> 01:43:15.737
Um...

1108
01:43:19.824 --> 01:43:22.284
You know what?

1109
01:43:22.285 --> 01:43:24.871
You never know what can happen.

1110
01:43:25.914 --> 01:43:28.290
Do you think
if you drink enough milk,

1111
01:43:28.291 --> 01:43:30.584
- you just turn into a cow?
- No.

1112
01:43:30.585 --> 01:43:32.544
Would you start, like,

1113
01:43:32.545 --> 01:43:34.630
getting, like, spots
on you like a cow?

1114
01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:37.091
- No.
- What would happen? Just...

1115
01:45:11.811 --> 01:45:15.147
No, not today. Sorry.

1116
01:45:18.693 --> 01:45:20.903
I said, read the s...

1117
01:49:05.253 --> 01:49:09.965
C... O...

1118
01:49:09.966 --> 01:49:13.635
M... E...

1119
01:49:13.636 --> 01:49:17.639
F... I...

1120
01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.310
N... D...

1121
01:49:21.311 --> 01:49:24.146
M... E.

1122
01:49:25.171 --> 01:49:27.171
