1
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,287
Yes, sir.

2
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,254
Where are you?

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,088
We're making a U-turn
and we're on our way.

4
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,562
Let's get ready.

5
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,564
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,197
Two in the front,
the rest block the stairs.

7
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,672
Jump him as a group.
He's one strong bastard.

8
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,375
I told you we should call for backup.

9
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,444
You scared?

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,548
Of course not.

11
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:27,718
Let's hurry and finally end
this two-month stakeout.

12
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,222
He's in.

13
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:15,725
Hurry!

14
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,269
Grab the big guy, but let the kid go.

15
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,742
Make sure you see him deliver it.

16
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,747
Hello?

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,121
It's been delivered.

18
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,734
- You can't go in, sir.
- Let go of me! Stay still!

19
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,836
Stay still, asshole.

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,275
I got the goods.

21
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,550
I'll leave right now.

22
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,877
Bear is on the move.

23
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,481
What do I do?

24
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,513
- You sure about the delivery?

25
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,917
- I saw it!

26
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,519
- Why isn't he coming out?

27
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,922
- I told you, I saw it myself!

28
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,456
Do I jump him or not?

29
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,191
Once he's out the door, it's all over!

30
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,324
Sir!

31
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,894
Sir!

32
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,931
Get him.

33
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,504
Mother fucker!

34
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,739
Stay still!

35
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,405
Goddamn it!

36
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,676
Fucking bastard!

37
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,218
Grab him!

38
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,426
Teddy bear!

39
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,768
Let's go.

40
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,396
We got snacks for you at the station.

41
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,338
Mother fucker.

42
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,019
He got away.

43
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,952
Ran with the goods.

44
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,852
Fuck!

45
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,623
Don't get so worked up.

46
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,858
Those little pricks.

47
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,008
Crazy bitch.

48
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,361
You squeeze it, you buy it.

49
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,031
What do you need?

50
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,356
Come out.

51
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,368
Or I'll kill you.

52
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,873
I didn't steal your milk.

53
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,645
I'm not lying.

54
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,050
I don't steal anymore.

55
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,018
Hey, flowers!

56
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,024
You know Yong-chul, right?

57
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:40,565
I saw him in the bathroom
and I was so embarrassed.

58
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,366
The kids asked if I liked him,
but why would I?

59
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,998
And look, my tooth is shaky.

60
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,738
Does it hurt
when you pull your tooth out?

61
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,707
Huh?

62
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,040
Mister?

63
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,718
Why do I bother?

64
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,449
I'm too old to pull my tooth out.

65
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,114
I don't want to.

66
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,505
Why only a dollar?

67
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,067
You owed me fifty cents.

68
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,142
But I put in a lot of new songs.

69
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,537
You have bad taste in music.

70
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,874
How mean.

71
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:34,442
Give that back for a second.

72
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,589
Sausage!

73
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,191
I like sausage too.

74
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,537
What are you saving up for?

75
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,837
Ta-da! Nail art.

76
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,946
I'm the best in my class.

77
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,911
Should I do yours?

78
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,711
A lot of men do it these days.

79
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,883
Are you really a gangster?

80
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,091
They say you're hiding

81
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,559
because you did something bad.

82
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:21,633
And Mom warned me
that you're a child molester.

83
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,937
Why?

84
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,078
Do you think I'm a bad guy, too?

85
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,882
Well...
You do look like the prison type.

86
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,555
- JUNG So-mi! Are you in there?
- It's Mom!

87
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,056
I'm not here.

88
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,585
Hey, mister!

89
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,188
Open the door!

90
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,795
Mister, is So-mi here?

91
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,835
- She's not here.

92
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,064
- I heard voices inside.

93
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,008
Why won't you open the door then?

94
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,270
JUNG So-mi, I know you're in there!

95
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,137
Get out here, now!

96
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,942
Open the door.

97
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,245
I said, open it.

98
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,091
What are you doing?

99
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,162
JUNG So-mi.

100
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,736
You better come outright now!

101
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,978
She's really not here?

102
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,787
I'm warning you.

103
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,949
Stop luring my kid in here.

104
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,828
If you touch her, I'll kill you.

105
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,323
You can go screw married women,

106
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,861
but don't mess with kids.

107
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,828
I'll rip your balls off.

108
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,701
If you're that desperate,
then ask me out.

109
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,112
You're easy on the eyes.

110
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,340
I'd date you.

111
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,312
Well?

112
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,221
Pussy.

113
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,699
Isn't it pretty?

114
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,375
Don't touch other people's things.

115
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,839
You had fun?

116
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,879
Tell your boss that I'll get his ass.

117
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,913
Good luck with that shit.

118
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,298
You lost all the goods I gave you.

119
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,134
Did you think I'd go hire
you a private eye?

120
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,167
I sent my boys after it.

121
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,403
I'll find those bitches...

122
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,045
This is why
you scumbags can't be trusted.

123
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,950
Goddamn useless

124
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,079
developing country idiots.

125
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,151
Who brought this fucker?

126
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,060
Fucking Vietcong.

127
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:19,701
160 million Chinese do weed,
26 on meth, and 11 on heroin.

128
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,897
It's a gold mine.

129
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,940
The UN says so.

130
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,243
Three days,

131
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,208
I'll hold those Chinese here.

132
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:31,305
You better find that sample heroin.

133
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,079
Or I'll donate you two
to the Bodies exhibition.

134
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,456
That's your specialty,
so you get my drift.

135
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,093
A military in power
is what this damn country needs.

136
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,738
You fucking little whore!

137
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,943
Are you crazy?

138
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,953
Where are the goods?

139
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,820
Answer me.

140
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,460
I did all the work.

141
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,827
I deserve half.

142
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,489
Don't I?

143
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,426
Fucking bitch!

144
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,929
Listen up, Hyo-jung.

145
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,297
20 percent is enough.

146
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,807
You have one day.

147
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,773
Don't bullshit me.

148
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,850
I can just sell it all and run!

149
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,010
You're asking for it, aren't you?

150
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,952
Do you know who they are?

151
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,391
Don't fuck it up.

152
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,357
Fucking tramp.

153
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,465
Like mother, like daughter.

154
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,410
Go outside and play.

155
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,210
I promise.

156
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,584
I'll go when Mom's friends leave.

157
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,987
You know what your nickname is?

158
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,256
The "pawnshop ghost".

159
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,291
Guess my nickname.

160
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,666
What is it?

161
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,509
I'm not telling.

162
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,119
It's "garbage".

163
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,455
My aunt told me,

164
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:06,929
Mom kicked a garbage can
when she got pregnant with me.

165
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,296
It's been garbage ever since.

166
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,993
Funny, right?

167
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,103
Go to sleep.

168
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,143
Pawnshop ghost and garbage.

169
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,643
Sounds like a rock band.

170
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,140
Doesn't it?

171
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,678
I feel like playing video games...

172
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:58,249
"I DIDN'T HAVE MY SUPPLIES,
BUT ISN'T IT STILL CUTE?"

173
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:51,569
"Kim yeon-su"

174
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,262
What's wrong with you?

175
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,228
What's your mom's phone number?

176
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,637
Answer me!

177
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,435
Stop hitting her so much!

178
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,271
Look at my son's scars!

179
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,469
You can't even keep

180
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,673
these bums away, with all the taxes

181
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,714
I'm paying?

182
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,115
Did your mom tell you
to glare at adults?

183
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,219
Did you steal his bag?

184
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,858
I didn't steal it.

185
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,723
I just wanted to compare it with mine.

186
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,393
You don't have a bag, you bum!

187
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,367
Don't touch!

188
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,529
You'll get germs!

189
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:04,164
You need an adult here to settle this.

190
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,776
Isn't your mom home?

191
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,545
That's your dad?

192
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,417
Excuse me, sir!

193
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,583
Sir!

194
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,193
Over here!

195
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,692
Hey!

196
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,892
He's not your dad?

197
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,699
Hello?

198
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,865
- Where are you?

199
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,643
- Woah.

200
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,407
Sounds like he really beat you hard.

201
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,642
You're smoking it up
while I'm out working.

202
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,514
Mom and Dad would be proud.

203
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,780
Not so hard...

204
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,417
That's just life.

205
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,652
Do-chi called. He found the bitch.

206
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,860
Who?

207
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,826
The fucking dancer?

208
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,652
Are you mad?

209
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,556
That's why you shouldn't steal.

210
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,378
How much is what she just took?

211
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,278
Leave her be.

212
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,845
Kids will learn from their mistakes.

213
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,655
Parenting isn'tjust giving birth.

214
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,260
She's always by herself.

215
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,897
Bring her around more often,
like the other dads.

216
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,833
It's on me.

217
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,053
Give me back my MP3.

218
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,936
I don't have money, so take this.

219
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,470
My lucky card.

220
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,004
It beats everything.

221
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,708
Bye.

222
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,385
Mister?

223
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,727
I embarrass you too, right?

224
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,793
That's why you ignored me?

225
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,092
It's okay.

226
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:55,896
My teacher and all the kids do that, too.

227
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,868
Mom said that if I get lost,

228
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,708
I should forget our address
and phone number.

229
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,717
She gets drunk and says we should die.

230
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,784
Even though that pig called me a bum...

231
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,552
You're meaner.

232
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,819
But I don't hate you.

233
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:25,096
Because if I do,
I won't have anyone I like.

234
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,539
Thinking about it hurts me here.

235
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,142
So I won't hate you.

236
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,559
Mom?

237
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,774
We're looking for something.

238
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,876
You're going to help us.

239
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:25,012
Do I look like a fucking school bully?

240
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,062
Get out.

241
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,274
Did you find it?

242
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,945
The thing is...

243
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,109
Things got a bit interesting up here.

244
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,241
Who are you?

245
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,986
You came to the wrong place.

246
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,316
I didn't call the cops, so just go.

247
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,285
How thoughtful of you.

248
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,619
We'll go once we get our goods.

249
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,860
PARK Hyo-jung gave you
a camera bag yesterday.

250
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,264
Hand it over.

251
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,162
A day is worth half-month interest.

252
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,570
80 dollars capital
and 4 percent interest.

253
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,301
Deals must be made in person.

254
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,205
Is that so?

255
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,611
I had no idea.

256
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,741
But what will we do?

257
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,350
Get over here. Say something!

258
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,086
- Mom! - Talk!

259
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,782
- Don't! Stop it!
- Go ahead, talk!

260
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,052
You little bitch!

261
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,286
Mommy!

262
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,790
Are you okay? Mommy!

263
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,798
Wake up, Mom!

264
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,228
Mommy!

265
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,338
She can't go right now.

266
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,764
How much?

267
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,069
You want these two to die for that?

268
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,331
Fucking...

269
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,033
Mister...

270
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,042
Save me! Mister!

271
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,982
Mister...

272
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,819
You couldn't handle one fucking guy?

273
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,323
Boxing? Karate?

274
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,454
Was he that good?

275
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,065
I'm telling you,
you should've seen him.

276
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,398
He was so fucking fast.

277
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,906
Don't you think...

278
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:38,940
Forget it.

279
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,307
No big deal.

280
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,004
This is good.

281
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,275
We needed a fall guy anyway.

282
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,963
You're saying...

283
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,060
Your neighbor and her kid got kidnapped
by drug dealers?

284
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,229
Is that right?

285
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:08,964
Yes.

286
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,007
Is she really your neighbor?

287
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,270
Just give me your address.
I'll send a squad car.

288
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,140
Hello?

289
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,807
You can't give me your address,
can you?

290
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,511
Look, sir.

291
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,153
If you're that Ionely,
call information instead.

292
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,852
They have prettier voices, all right?

293
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,304
I'll do as you say.

294
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,483
Don't hurt them.

295
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,950
You made the right choice, mister.

296
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,385
You just have to do one delivery for us.

297
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,343
What do you think?

298
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,037
Impressive.

299
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,202
Open the glove box.

300
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,274
Go to the driving range
and ask for OH Myung-kyu.

301
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,541
Deliver it at 6 P.M.

302
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,048
Be on time.

303
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,277
Toss the phone once I hang up.

304
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,454
When will you let them go?

305
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,250
There's a soup place around the corner.

306
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,522
I got a table at 9 P.M., so look there.

307
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,638
Look at these petty thieves.

308
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,434
Where's the murder, the meat?

309
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,599
You wish.

310
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,370
Fuck my life.

311
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,279
This is NOH, DEA department.

312
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,984
That's right.

313
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,216
Welcome. Come this way.

314
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,160
Over here.

315
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,192
Nice to meet you.

316
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,633
- Was that right? - Yes.

317
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,103
- Good. - Have a seat.

318
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,211
He came alone?

319
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,506
Yes, sir.

320
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,518
These Chinese got spunk, don't they?

321
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,488
Hurry up, then.

322
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,391
Tell him it's imported
and I hope he likes it.

323
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,588
Be polite. Dandy, you hear?

324
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,064
The tea is from shenyang, china

325
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,726
Please have it.

326
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,395
Please.

327
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,477
Saw some gangster films, eh?

328
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,206
May as well be at a funeral.

329
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,577
Should I translate?

330
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:20,809
If you want to die.

331
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,612
Does he think it's poisoned?

332
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,586
Try the goddamn tea.

333
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,125
Are you OH Myung-kyu?

334
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,527
I delivered it as promised.

335
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,668
Hand them over.

336
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,330
What is this?

337
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,433
Who the hell sent you?

338
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,567
I made the delivery.

339
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,540
Keep your word.

340
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,477
What is he saying?

341
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,875
Did you get the goods?

342
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,380
Man-seok?

343
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,402
You trying to dump this shit on me?

344
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,735
Why not?

345
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,276
You thought I'd just let you
take my business?

346
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,607
You think you'll get away with this?

347
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,608
Mr. OH.

348
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,686
Mister fucking OH Myung-kyu.

349
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,412
One word of advice.

350
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,221
Kiss all the ass you can,
but you're fucked.

351
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,384
You got that, bitch?

352
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,520
If you want to live, then run!

353
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,462
You fucking gold mother fucker!

354
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,363
Mother fucker!

355
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,640
Hey, Chinese major.

356
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,571
There goes your paycheck!

357
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,909
You fucker!

358
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,573
Get over here!

359
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,242
Grab him!

360
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,485
What the fuck?

361
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,651
Get my jacket!

362
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,663
Goddamn bastards.

363
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,437
Hey!

364
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,339
Throw him to the cops.

365
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,742
You three go this way.

366
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,528
Block the exits!

367
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,992
What the hell?

368
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,366
OH Myung-kyu, you fucking bastard!

369
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,591
Holy shit!

370
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,553
LEE Kwang-su.

371
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,849
JU Jae-young.

372
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,582
KIM Bu-seong.

373
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,586
- PARK Man-kyu.
- Drip on the floor, you die!

374
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,620
You better not water it down!

375
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,391
- Fucking bitches won't answer me.
- We got you.

376
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,767
No small talk!

377
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,874
No exchanging of urine!
- Yes, sir.

378
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,873
Do as you're told!

379
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,068
No organs?

380
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,576
That's right.

381
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,475
Cornea, liver, kidneys, skin tissue.

382
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,015
Took everything worth any money.

383
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,813
But harvesting isn't OH's style.

384
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,721
Who's that?

385
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,119
Came out of nowhere.

386
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,552
We're looking him up,

387
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,060
but we can't link him to OH Myung-kyu.

388
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,438
It was crammed inside the furnace.

389
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,737
It's too little. They already took it.

390
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,906
Yeah.

391
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,706
Name is CHA Tae-shik.

392
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,748
Lives in Yongsan, Seoul.366.

393
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,716
No drug offense and tested clean.

394
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,888
But from 1998 to 2006,
there's no record for him.

395
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:34,922
No record?

396
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,722
These pricks never register,
so dig into his connections.

397
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,161
Just find his link to OH Myung-kyu.

398
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,160
This is a murder case.

399
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,142
21 Dongja district in Yongsan...

400
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,811
A pawnshop?

401
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,218
A vein burst in her nostrils.

402
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,857
You know what that means?

403
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,759
Her heart was beating
when they got her eyes.

404
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,891
Ripped out of her head
while she was alive!

405
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,793
The drugs aren't half your problems.

406
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,704
You keep playing quiet
and you're fucked!

407
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,675
Understand?

408
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,574
Excuse me, Detective.

409
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,047
Don't we get any snacks?

410
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,843
Snacks?

411
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,282
You fucking want snacks?

412
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,584
Which one's CHA Tae-shik?

413
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,215
Why? There's a lock on his record.

414
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,118
A lock?

415
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,991
Here's the stuff on OH Myung-kyu.

416
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,928
Tell Chi-gon I need to see him.

417
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,694
But he won't be back any time soon...

418
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,133
"DARK KNIGHT"

419
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,099
"Escaped from Baron's castle.
Disappears into shadows at sunrise."

420
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,981
All right, let's just eat first.

421
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,948
Excuse me.

422
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,554
I'm left-handed.

423
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,616
Nothing beats hunger, eh?

424
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,228
He finally speaks!

425
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,695
We're making progress.

426
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,027
Let's eat and get this over with.

427
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,750
Holy shit!

428
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,708
Hello?

429
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,641
What the... Who is this?

430
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,213
I'm just the Chinese major.

431
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,275
All I did was ask for some food.

432
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,783
Where's Detective PARK?

433
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,352
Put him on the phone!

434
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,383
Please don't kill me...

435
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,833
Young man!

436
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,830
Can you see that plate number?

437
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,072
What?

438
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,975
See if it's my son's van, would you?

439
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:44,681
What's the number?

440
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,680
It's 5124.

441
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,421
It's right, 5124!

442
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,357
Let go of me! Let's go meet Mommy.

443
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,736
Come up.

444
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,470
What about my mom?

445
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,038
You don't come up, you won't see her.

446
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,052
Open the door!

447
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,320
Please! Let me out!

448
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,395
Open the door!

449
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,077
6:41 P.M.

450
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,253
6:43P.M.

451
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,591
45 and 18 seconds.

452
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,896
Six cops hospitalized.

453
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,056
And OH's files stolen
in 4 minutes 30 seconds.

454
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,997
Jung-ho's teeth are out.

455
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,898
KWON's knee is busted.

456
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,972
This is one complicated mother fucker.

457
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:01,305
The lock code on him is,011.Guess who?

458
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,140
Military intelligence.

459
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,512
A lock on a civilian file,
that's a first.

460
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,516
I'm tingling with curiosity.

461
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,011
There is one option.

462
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,357
What do you want to do?

463
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,620
Remember the short track
incident with Ono?

464
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:22,159
A third-grade kid
from Korea sent Bush an E-mail.

465
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,130
It read, "I'll kill you".

466
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:28,068
So the FBI asked us to look into it.

467
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,565
The dirty ones are
always more suspicious.

468
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,465
So you're saying...

469
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,873
We'll send one as CHA Tae-shik.

470
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,080
They send us a request,
and it's a one deal.

471
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,979
Even the NIS will have
to release the information.

472
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,450
Obama... To Obama?

473
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,646
You know Obama's E-mail, you idiot?

474
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,049
To the White House.

475
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,065
So, is that a go?

476
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,263
Or stop?

477
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,200
Send the mail or not?

478
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,531
Go, no matter what.

479
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,546
Please don't kill me.

480
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,946
I'm telling you the truth!

481
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,054
That bitch started it all...

482
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,950
That's the only reason...

483
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,924
Koreans never get shit done in time.

484
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,428
Olympics come and they finally
start building bridges.

485
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,325
But they're bound to collapse.

486
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,402
You were only trying
to earn some weed money?

487
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,065
And no one is behind it?

488
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,936
Fucking prick.

489
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,609
Then who's that pawnshop bastard?

490
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,305
He's with you, isn't he?

491
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,349
What pawnshop?

492
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,081
Counting to three.

493
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,624
Then I'll torch your prick. One.

494
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,625
Please forgive me!

495
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,285
Two.

496
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,953
Don't kill me!

497
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,498
Please don't kill me!

498
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,396
- Three. - Please don't!

499
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,409
You fucking startled me!

500
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,413
You're wasting your time.

501
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,711
The food is here. Let's eat.

502
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,082
Can't you signal before you cut in?

503
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,219
I don't believe that pawnshop bastard.

504
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,093
Only an idiot would not call the cops.

505
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,700
Who cares? This is our town.

506
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,367
- What about OH? - I sent Ramrowan.

507
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,400
Alone?

508
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,300
This is Dolce and Gabbana!

509
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,569
Goddamn it. I just bought it yesterday!

510
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,643
Alone, again?

511
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,746
Yes!

512
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,048
I told you not to send him alone.

513
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,716
That sick bastard
likes going rogue anyway.

514
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,056
Let me go, just this once!

515
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,164
I'll double what they pay you!

516
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,027
Please let me go!

517
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,135
Once we refine the meth in here,

518
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,607
we'll both be set for life!

519
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,821
Hey, I got it!

520
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,459
I got it.

521
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,792
The dead woman's daughter.

522
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:46,296
She ran errands for CHA and
came here sometimes.

523
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,405
PARK Hyo-jung and CHA were lovers.

524
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,734
Kid runs the deliveries.
It's a perfect fit!

525
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,706
Game set!

526
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:57,744
So his lover was cut open
and her eyes ripped out?

527
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,439
By CHA Tae-shik?

528
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,316
No?

529
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,582
Still no trace of the daughter?

530
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,383
Who's got time for her?

531
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,458
With OH Myung-kyu on the loose.

532
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,158
Hello?

533
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,457
I got it.

534
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,101
CHA Tae-shik.

535
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,472
Just get on with it!

536
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,768
Yes, sir.

537
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:31,474
This is the information
we received from the U.S.

538
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,314
CHA Tae-shik.

539
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:39,115
A Special Forces agent
in the Army Intelligence Command.

540
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,225
Completed classified missions
from '98 to 2006.

541
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,726
A drill instructor
for specialized forces.

542
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,353
Received a gold star
and a military merit order.

543
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:52,298
Say hello to your guarantor, gentlemen.

544
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,527
He's got bad credit...

545
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,663
Mainly enemy raids, munitions,
assassination and kidnap.

546
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,207
Specializes in
secret foreign operations.

547
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,605
How much do you need?

548
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,209
You sold this here?

549
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,879
There's been some kind of mix-up.

550
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:11,517
We do loans, not telephones.

551
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,818
Tell me who bought it
and you won't get hurt.

552
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,457
What are you, a cop?

553
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,260
The brutal training program is

554
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,665
said to have made

555
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,601
some congressman faint from shock.

556
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,604
That's all we know.

557
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,878
Fuck!

558
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,227
He bought dozens at a time. A harvestor.

559
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,706
He deals hearts, livers,
things like that.

560
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,468
After a car accident in 2006,

561
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,943
CHA Tae-shik's official records
have stopped.

562
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,542
Gunshot wounds?

563
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,740
Unlike the other passenger,

564
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,283
CHA was taken to a military hospital.

565
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,649
According to his surgeon,

566
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,722
he was shot, not in a car accident.

567
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,792
Who the hell is this kid?

568
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,417
Who was the other passenger?

569
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:28,588
His wife. She died at the scene.

570
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,827
We got a lead on CHA.

571
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,602
Where are you?

572
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:43,644
Yes.

573
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,645
This isn't online shopping.

574
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,841
We need to talk in person.

575
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,246
Yes.

576
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,747
The dream of a longer life,

577
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,792
it's not about eating health food.

578
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:58,951
Yes.

579
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,322
We'll go over the medical records.

580
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,762
All right.

581
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,941
Come on, baby!

582
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,550
You'll ruin the taste.

583
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,315
Ever hear this before?

584
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,787
Dupont!

585
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,669
Bottoms up.

586
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,038
Cheers.

587
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,440
You're serious?

588
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:50,876
If I find him,
you'll rip up my loan contract?

589
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,780
Just tell me where he is.

590
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:55,976
Okay.

591
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,582
Yeah.

592
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,520
He stole their car.

593
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,353
We got him crossing the bridge.

594
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,690
And we tracked Dochi's phone there too.

595
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,559
Be careful.

596
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:29,709
Welcome back, sir.

597
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,047
Thanks.

598
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,432
First time here?

599
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,070
They've got great girls.

600
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,743
Hot and steamy.

601
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,582
But it's looking bleak tonight.

602
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,050
It's usually a sure thing here.

603
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,018
Hey.

604
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,126
I think tonight's a bust.

605
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,055
No fish in the sea.

606
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:17,828
Let's go somewhere else.

607
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:24,938
Where's Dochi?

608
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,703
Come out.

609
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:33,744
Come out.

610
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,477
All right! Fuck!

611
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,984
It's chronic constipation.

612
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,924
Come this way.

613
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,199
Dialysis.

614
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,099
Once it hits, you can hardly move.

615
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,938
Since it's for your wife,
I'll give you a discount.

616
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:02,772
What's your religion?

617
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:03,879
Religion?

618
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,481
You need membership
at a temple or cathedral.

619
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,141
Shows as voluntary donation
and what not.

620
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,681
Takes two months. Are you hot?

621
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,651
You're sweating like a dog.

622
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,154
I'm okay.

623
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,752
Hello?

624
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,125
Yes.

625
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,793
I'm in the bathroom.

626
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,027
Yes.

627
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,629
Okay.

628
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,171
Who's that?

629
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:32,933
A friend.

630
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,907
A friend who?

631
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,005
Who are you? Get out!

632
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,546
Were we expecting another one?

633
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,813
Get the fuck out!

634
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,155
Mister! Over here!

635
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,534
Fucking son of a bitch.

636
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,771
I won't ask twice.

637
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,837
Where is So-mi?

638
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,744
Fuck you, bitch!

639
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,687
So, you sold her...

640
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,625
To the ants nest?

641
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:29,823
I don't know!

642
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,026
Man-seok and Jong-seok know!

643
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,604
Where are they?

644
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,534
All right!

645
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,235
All right!

646
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,789
Out of the way!

647
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:10,044
You scared the shit out of me.

648
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,441
Pawnshop.

649
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,974
Weren't you at the station?

650
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,811
Why did you kill So-mi's mother?

651
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,113
Hey, don't blame us.

652
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:21,246
She actually saved three lives.

653
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,826
And you did the delivery,
so you killed her.

654
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,329
Hello?

655
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:29,987
Hello?

656
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:33,566
Hello?

657
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,427
Is that what you did to So-mi?

658
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,198
What do you think?

659
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,605
Her insides are shit
since they're not ripe,

660
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,070
but I can sell her corneas.

661
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,339
It pays surprisingly well.

662
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:49,213
Five years in prison. That's all I ask.

663
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,616
She might be waiting when you get out.

664
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,447
You only live for tomorrow.

665
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,921
What?

666
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,027
The ones that live for tomorrow

667
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,363
get fucked by the ones living for today.

668
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,364
What are you babbling about?

669
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,526
I only live for today.

670
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:13,641
I'll show you just how fucked up

671
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,311
that can be.

672
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,441
He hung up on me.

673
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,117
Report to the NIS, is that it?

674
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,487
We gave you information,
but you lost the suspect and drugs.

675
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,025
This can't continue.

676
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:35,255
Report all files on OH
and other connected suspects.

677
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,492
Your D.A.
And I went to college together.

678
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,162
Let's keep things quiet.

679
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,902
You're fucking kidding me.

680
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,102
Are you after OH Myung-kyu
or CHA Tae-shik?

681
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:50,906
It was us that staked out
for two goddamn months.

682
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,572
And it's our boys lying in the hospital.

683
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:57,617
I'll catch them, write them up,
throw them in.

684
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:02,415
I'll fuck anyone in my way,
and give up my badge for it.

685
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,623
You just don't get it.

686
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:14,167
A National Defense employee tried
to sell information overseas in 2006.

687
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,568
200 million dollar's worth of national
security information.

688
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:22,510
Special forces were sent to assassinate
and recover the goods.

689
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,547
MOON Dal-seo, infiltration unit agent.

690
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,120
And CHA Tae-shik,
from extermination units.

691
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,091
Mission was successful,

692
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,662
but not without sacrifices.

693
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,207
Isn't it beautiful?

694
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,222
I'm so proud of it...

695
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,189
So proud, it makes me cry.

696
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,296
Let me hug you.

697
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,070
Both of you.

698
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:23,722
Have a nice day.

699
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:24,798
Thanks.

700
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:25,750
Agent CHA!

701
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,557
- Tae-shik! - Agent CHA!

702
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,756
Look at me, Tae-shik!

703
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,164
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

704
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,326
- Tae-shik!

705
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,404
Call an ambulance!

706
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:42,175
- Agent CHA! - Stay still!

707
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,805
Yeon-su!

708
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,643
Look at me, you bastard!

709
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,686
Don't move! You're losing blood!

710
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,580
Should I ask what happened?

711
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,582
Get me a gun.

712
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,516
Wow.

713
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:33,555
First words in three years,
and that's it?

714
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,857
Not a Colt or a Tokarev.

715
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,266
Semi-automatic, at least 10 chambers.

716
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:42,763
Get some rest.

717
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,506
Your temperature is over.

718
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:30,416
One by one,
I brought the abandoned mutts home.

719
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:36,354
Now I can't tell if this is a scrap yard
or a dog pound.

720
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,337
An inch higher
and that bullet would've killed you.

721
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,874
Don't do it.

722
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,543
I don't know what it is,
but don't do it.

723
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,542
There's someone, I need to find.

724
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,959
It's only been a few days,

725
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,496
but I can't remember her face.

726
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,008
I should've taken a picture.

727
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,055
She took out 8000 dollars.

728
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,865
A second-grade kid!

729
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,899
Does that make sense?

730
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:57,370
Account belongs to NAM Sung-shik,
PARK's pimp.

731
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,871
And it matches his statement.

732
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:18,677
Mister?

733
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,588
Sir, tell them I'm innocent!

734
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,724
CHA Tae-shik.

735
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:31,591
I'm KIM Chi-gon of the DEA.

736
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,593
Remember me?

737
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,564
I'll cut to the chase.

738
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,835
I'm going to catch you.

739
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,710
But let me ask you one thing.

740
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:47,043
You know PARK Hyo-jung's daughter,
JUNG So-mi?

741
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,179
Are you looking for her?

742
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,651
So-mi is alive.

743
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:58,716
She took out money at an ATM
near Gasan Station.

744
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,496
Tell me everything you know.

745
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,994
Or you'll never find her.

746
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,799
Man-seok and Jong-seok.

747
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:10,996
What?

748
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,767
They sent me to OH Myung-kyu,

749
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:16,537
and they killed So-mi's mother.

750
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,874
That's everything I know.

751
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,649
The broker that worked for Man-Jong?

752
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,620
JANG Du-shik.

753
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,525
Find him and start searching Chinatown.

754
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:36,824
Chinatown?

755
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,640
Is it good?

756
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,011
Tell the brothers

757
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,876
I'm leaving with the kid.

758
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:28,809
Say good-bye.

759
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,317
Bye. You're leaving?

760
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:34,315
Be good and you'll go home like her.

761
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:35,554
Understand?

762
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,214
Let's go.

763
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,019
Mi-jin...

764
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,252
Bye.

765
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,827
Thanks!

766
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:04,082
If I'm good, I can see my mom again?

767
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,686
OUT OF ORDER

768
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:49,254
Hey! JANG Du-shik!

769
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,692
What?

770
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:52,929
Who are you?

771
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,229
Who do you think, moron?

772
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,769
I'm Jesus.

773
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,335
I'm going to make you walk.

774
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,140
Help! Over here!

775
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,042
- This man... - Shut your trap!

776
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,079
He's hitting a crippled man!

777
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,706
He's hitting a crippled man!

778
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,810
It's empty.

779
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,334
Atten-hut. Atten-hut!

780
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,011
Run to the paddy wagon.

781
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,306
Yes, sir!

782
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:44,909
Left...

783
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,252
I really don't know.

784
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,188
Half are in prison.

785
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:53,920
The rest are hiding,
so they don't contact us.

786
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,987
This kid is missing.

787
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,458
Are they even selling kids these days?

788
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,463
Come on.

789
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,105
This isn't the eighties anymore, man.

790
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,005
Of course, they've done worse.

791
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:16,276
But this isn't it. She's just an ant.

792
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,817
An ant?

793
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,949
Yeah, an ant.

794
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:21,919
"OUT OF ORDER"

795
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:33,958
It's the Chinese mafia system.

796
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,763
That's right, the Chinese mafia.

797
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:37,803
All those social outcasts, you know?

798
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,739
People in debt!

799
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:46,336
They take their kids
and send them on deliveries.

800
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,746
Who suspects a kid, right?
They're just kids!

801
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,814
Cheap to maintain, safe from the cops.

802
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,013
It's the perfect solution!

803
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,918
And it's impossible to track.

804
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,076
Excuse me, sir.

805
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,370
Hey!

806
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,380
402! Code 402!

807
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,039
Freeze!

808
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,291
Put your hands up!

809
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,368
Stop right there!

810
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,992
Hey!

811
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:44,210
Kids are so dramatic.

812
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:48,582
Hey, kid!

813
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:51,617
Just take her away.

814
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,616
Get back to work!

815
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,500
What is it? I'm busy.

816
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:05,837
Hello?

817
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:09,846
So-mi.

818
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,578
Bring her to me.

819
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,524
Pawnshop?

820
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,554
How'd you get over there?

821
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:26,591
Man-seok!

822
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:28,469
Who was that?

823
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:30,662
This is your last chance.

824
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:33,841
Bring her to me within the hour.

825
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,570
I asked you who that was,
mother fucker!

826
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,945
You have no idea who you're up against.

827
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:51,353
Touch one hair on my brother's body,

828
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:54,017
and I'll rip her eyes and guts out!

829
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:59,892
You fucking bastard!

830
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,009
Tell Ramrowan to rip her eyes out.

831
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,722
What are you doing?

832
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,629
When the kids died,

833
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,802
you took out their organs.

834
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:42,338
Sent the liver to one district,

835
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,103
the eyes to another...

836
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,742
And the heart to Seoul.

837
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:53,815
Isn't that right?

838
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,113
I didn't do it.

839
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,522
Those young children,

840
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:05,696
wandering the country
even after death...

841
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:12,099
Did that ever cross your mind?

842
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,873
What about you?

843
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:18,041
You ever wonder
how much they're worth?

844
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:21,580
Even their parents
don't want them anymore.

845
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:25,108
It's a win-win situation.

846
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:27,384
Am I right?

847
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,080
Wrong.

848
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:35,028
Just now,

849
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,700
you should've apologized to those kids.

850
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,730
Mother fucker.

851
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,040
If anything happens to me,

852
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,772
you'll never see that bitch again.

853
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:53,938
You get me?

854
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:57,041
Even if I find So-mi,

855
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,452
you two are still dead.

856
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:12,122
Hey.

857
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:16,434
Wait!

858
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,839
Fuck!

859
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,951
Goddamn it!

860
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,452
Hello?

861
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:39,053
Hello?

862
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,797
Say something, you asshole!

863
01:31:47,935 --> 01:31:49,630
Mother fucker!

864
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,553
Hold onto it.

865
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:23,169
Time to get back home.

866
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,636
Where's my mom?

867
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:46,958
Mom?

868
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:54,001
Mommy's right here.

869
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:01,106
I took her heart out.

870
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:06,839
So Mommy is right here.

871
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,981
Let's shake hands.

872
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:12,912
Why?

873
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,148
Don't you want to?

874
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:27,593
You said I could see my mom again.

875
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:31,029
He's lying, right?

876
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:32,935
She's not dead.

877
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,702
She's not dead, right?

878
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:37,834
She's alive.

879
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:42,245
Mister, you're lying, right?

880
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:48,581
My mom is alive!

881
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:51,920
Where is she? Let me see her.

882
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,959
Please, mister!

883
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:01,896
Shit.

884
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:03,970
Coming through!

885
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,205
Identifications.

886
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,272
Inspect these people.

887
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:13,337
Granny.

888
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:15,975
We know everything.

889
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,978
Where are the kids?

890
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:22,115
Goddamn it.

891
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:23,814
Where the hell are they?

892
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,718
Detective NOH!

893
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,864
Yeah. What did you find?

894
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:42,100
I got a name.

895
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:46,077
OH Sang-man, a surgeon.
Served 3 and a half for drug use.

896
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:47,771
Known as "500".

897
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:51,374
His goal is to cut open 500 bodies.

898
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,812
Track him down.

899
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:39,798
This is it? Just one guy?

900
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,367
There you are.

901
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:45,996
Who the fuck are you?

902
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:49,408
Why did you come
all the way here for her?

903
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,268
I'm her next-door neighbor.

904
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,180
Fucking idiot.

905
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,182
Her next-door neighbor?

906
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,487
You're fucking insane.

907
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:04,017
Where's Jong-seok?

908
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:06,092
So-mi first.

909
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:13,225
Hey.

910
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,162
Grab it.

911
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,236
Out of the way, moron!

912
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:32,478
I'll just stay over here.

913
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,846
Catch.

914
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:52,829
Strike!

915
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:17,362
She went to heaven to find her mommy.

916
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:22,300
But she can't find her
without her eyes.

917
01:37:22,536 --> 01:37:25,096
You messed with the wrong person.

918
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,307
Next-door neighbor?

919
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:32,813
You think this is some fucking joke?

920
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,517
Where's my brother?

921
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:41,012
Where the fuck is my brother?

922
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:53,165
How many cavities do you have?

923
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,494
What?

924
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:58,434
I run a pawnshop.

925
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:02,401
I take gold teeth.

926
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,615
I'll keep the gold teeth.

927
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:18,123
And I'll chew up everything else.

928
01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:47,043
Fuck!

929
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:36,385
Where the fuck did he get a gun?

930
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:38,455
Is he a cop?

931
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,583
Move your fucking ass, moron!

932
01:41:40,727 --> 01:41:43,252
Sorry, sir. I got shot earlier...

933
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:44,762
You won't die, bitch.

934
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:45,588
Hurry up!

935
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:46,756
Yes, sir.

936
01:43:45,886 --> 01:43:47,877
Get in the fucking car!

937
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:15,940
Fuck!

938
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:25,314
Son of a bitch.

939
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:39,769
Police?

940
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:43,399
Someone's getting killed!
Get over here!

941
01:44:43,543 --> 01:44:45,841
Just trace the call and get over here!

942
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,004
Fuck, he's here!

943
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:51,340
Hurry up, assholes!

944
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,419
He's fucking here!

945
01:45:09,503 --> 01:45:11,835
You moron!

946
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:15,772
It's bulletproof, mother fucker!

947
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,350
Shoot!

948
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:28,051
Shoot me, bitch!

949
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:33,823
Once the cops are here,
you're finished.

950
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:37,520
I'm not going anywhere!

951
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,367
I said it's fucking bulletproof!

952
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,593
One more bullet left.

953
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:22,160
Mister...

954
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:30,194
Mister...

955
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:09,198
Did you come to save me?

956
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:16,905
You came to save me, right?

957
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:24,550
Stay there.

958
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:27,783
You'll get blood on you.

959
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:39,864
Mister!

960
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,666
You came to save me!

961
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,309
Right?

962
01:49:45,879 --> 01:49:48,313
Right, mister?

963
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:33,853
He got his eyes ripped out.

964
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:51,810
Put her in with him.

965
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:28,408
Could I ask you a favor?

966
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,057
Little girl.

967
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:46,727
You really got into trouble this time.

968
01:52:12,258 --> 01:52:13,987
I'm sorry.

969
01:52:15,195 --> 01:52:20,326
I'm sorry
for pretending to not know you.

970
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:25,464
If I want to know you too much,

971
01:52:27,006 --> 01:52:28,940
I can't help not wanting to.

972
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:31,339
What's that supposed to mean?

973
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:37,012
I don't know either.

974
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:40,176
I've never seen you smile before.

975
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:48,026
You're on your own now.

976
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:52,730
You can do it, right?

977
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:05,401
Just once...

978
01:53:11,351 --> 01:53:13,376
Let me hug you once.

979
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:21,385
Let me hug you, just once.

980
01:54:01,534 --> 01:54:03,399
Mister...

981
01:54:04,037 --> 01:54:05,834
Are you crying?
