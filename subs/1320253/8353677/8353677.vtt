- Who gives a shit what the problem is?

334
00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:10.002

Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

337
00:25:18.594 --> 00:25:20.395
- This morning.
- Yeah? What'd you talk about?

338
00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:25.600

339
00:25:25.685 --> 00:25:26.768

You know, Toll Road,
you're an unusual guy,

341
00:25:30.106 --> 00:25:32.733
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

342
00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:35.360

talking about my ear.

Oh.

00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.030
Oh, come on. Don't start
with the ear again.

345

- The ear story, not again.

346
00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:41.366
- We all know the ear story.
- We don't want to hear the ear story.

No. Shit no. You

349
00:25:45.496 --> 00:25:48.290
- We all know I wrestled in college.
- Right.

350
00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:52.919
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

351
00:25:53.504 --> 00:25:56.631
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

352
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:58.884
and forms cauliflower ears.

353

- It ain't easy being green.

are gonna head down to Vilena

James Munroe.

604

He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

went rogue and teamed
up with the General

606

for themselves.

607

608
00:47:32.969 --> 00:47:36.013
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

to take out one of their own.
