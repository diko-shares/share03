WEBVTT

1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,400
Hey, slow down!

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,700
Whoa! That is not cool!

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,100
Thank you for coming tonight, Darwin.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,300
This room is secure,
so we can speak freely.

5
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,900
Why the secrecy?

6
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Because the Feds are coming
tomorrow... to shut us down.

7
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,200
Shut us down?
Without even giving us a chance?

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Yes.

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,400
And there's only one way
we can save this department,

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,200
and that's prove ourselves,
in the field.

11
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Our target is Leonard Saber.

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,200
As you know, he is a former arms dealer
and current CEO of Saberling Industries.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,800
The Bureau's intel shows Saber
has developed a new microchip

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,900
with possible military applications.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,000
They suspect he has sold his technology
to the Far East under the code name...

16
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
...Clusterstorm.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,300
Now, Darwin, we need to find out
how Saber plans to use this technology.

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Your mission is to download
the Clusterstorm files

19
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
from Saber's personal computer
located in his library, right here.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,300
Ben, we're gonna get you that evidence.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
We'll prove, once and for all,
what we can do.

22
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,500
We'll give 'em no choice.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
They'll have to keep the program
and make us special agents.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,300
Look, I believe in you,
but if we fail...

25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,100
...we blow a case they've been
trying to crack for two years.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,900
Hey, I'm nine inches tall.
I only see the upside.

27
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,400
Right this way, sir.

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Thank you.

29
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,600
Ticktock, we're on the clock.
Speckles, do you copy?

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,000
Ten-four.
I read you, Darwin. Five-by-five.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
All communication systems are online.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,700
Status report.

33
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,500
I have a visual on Saber.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,000
He's wearing a $6,000 suit,
$50,000 watch,

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and, according to my infrared scope,
Hanes size 36 tighty whiteys.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Saber's about to start his speech.
Remember, the clock is ticking, dude.

37
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,500
Blaster, Juarez, what's your twenty?

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,300
Juarez here.
Approaching first objective.

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,900
We're ten seconds ahead of schedule
because Blaster is a little hyped-up.

40
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,200
Of course I am. This is what I live for.

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Time to get this party started.

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,500
- Have any activity?
- Southbound is secure.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,400
OK, we're clear.

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Darwin,
you're behind schedule. You all right?

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,700
- First mission jitters, I guess.
- Do you want to abort?

46
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,600
No, no, it's OK.
I've been trained to do this.

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,300
I'd follow you
into a snarling pack of Dobermans!

48
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,600
Oh, wait. I already have.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Now, get your fuzzy hind end moving.

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,500
Hold on. There's a civilian
passing through the perimeter.

51
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,900
What are you looking at?
Move along, pal.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Oh!

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Don't worry. I just spotted my way in.

54
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,000
Whoa!

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Juarez...

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
- Blaster, don't drop a pellet.
- Too late.

57
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Whoa! Whoo!

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm cool.

60
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,200
Speckles to Mooch. Getting no visual.

61
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Over.

62
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,900
The fly is in the ointment.
Darwin, do you copy?

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Ah!

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Holy foxes.

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,200
- What's your twenty?
- I'm in the morgue.

67
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,700
# Don't you wish your blowtorch
was hot like mine #

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Good thing I took shop.

69
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Welcome to my home.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,400
I want you to know how grateful I am
to all of you for, once again, making us

71
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,200
the number one consumer
electronics brand in the world!

72
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,800
These things are so popular,
I can't get one.

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,500
Mooch, focus.
Come on, honey.

75
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
You're not here for the sweets.
Get back on mission.

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
For years,
we've been putting a secret...

77
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
...into the heart of every member
of the Saberling family,

78
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,800
be it the cryogenic refrigerator or
the new microwave-heated coffeemaker.

79
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,700
A secret which is at the core of
any successful family: Communication.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,400
- Hey, Juarez. Race you to the top!
- OK. On your mark, get set, go!

81
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
That's cold.

82
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,800
Darwin, the table's set. You are clear
to infiltrate Saber's study.

83
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
OK, I'm in.

84
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Clearing exfil route.

85
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,300
- Hey, it worked!
- Of course it worked.

86
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Nothing happens in this house
that I don't know about. Trust me.

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,500
In 48 hours, when I press this button,

88
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,200
it will activate a wireless system
we call "Sabersense,"

89
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
which will awaken the chips
already in the logic boards

90
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,400
of all Saberling appliances,

91
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,100
allowing this coffee machine
to know how much coffee's been used,

92
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,400
communicate with your home computer,
and add coffee to your shopping list.

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, in addition, Sabersense will link

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
every old and new Saberling
appliance in existence,

95
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,700
and create one big family!
And nothing will be the same.

96
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,600
Why did they put the Q
so far away from the O?

97
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,200
- OK, I'm in.
- Roger. I'm tracking it.

98
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,500
So what about it, Juarez?
You and me, I mean, you know...

99
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,000
Sorry, Blaster. You know
I've got my eye on someone else.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,100
- No. In fact, I didn't know. Who?
- Darwin.

101
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Why Darwin?

102
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,900
Because he's so...
so not interested in me.

103
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Copy that, Juarez.

104
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,400
- Oh, shoot!
- Keep the comm line clear.

105
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,100
- OK, Speckles, I think I found it.
- Thank you, and good night.

106
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,900
Saber wrapped his speech.
Mooch, give me an eyeball.

107
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,300
Christa,
I'm going upstairs for a drink.

108
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,100
Darwin, Saber's heading up.

109
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
About 50 seconds.

110
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Copy that.
I'm into the Clusterstorm file.

111
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,400
- Speckles, are you seeing this?
- I see it.

112
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,500
This isn't about selling weapons.
It's about global extermination.

113
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,700
I'm downloading now.

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Whoa! What just happened?

115
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,900
Encryption. Hands off the keys.

116
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,300
- I'm setting up a worm to decipher.
- Mooch.

117
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,900
You have to stop Saber.
Execute delay strategy B.

118
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,400
Yee-haw!

119
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
Ah!

120
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm back in. Commencing download.

121
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,400
- Speckles, you're a genius!
- I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

122
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Switching to wireless download.

123
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,400
Come on. Come on!

124
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,200
Ah!

125
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Darwin. Get out of there, now!

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I can't.
The chimney will block the signal.

127
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
Come on, baby, come on.

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
If he doesn't make it,
are you free Thursday night?

129
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,400
He'll make it.

130
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
- OK, drop the line.
- Here we go.

131
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Whoa! Now, Blaster!

132
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Ooh! Ouch!

133
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,500
Darwin! Your butt's on fire!

134
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,600
Stop, drop and roll!

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,200
- We got it. Speckles, exfil.
- Way ahead of you.

136
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,300
I'll be waiting at the entrance
of the... Whoa! Oh, no!

137
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Oh, my God!

138
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Speckles reports
a large canine at exfil.

139
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,400
No escape. Repeat: No escape.

140
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Hang on, Speckles.
We leave no rodent behind.

141
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Yippee!

142
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
- I'm going after the dog!
- Wait, Blaster! Think it through!

143
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,400
There's no time for thinking.

144
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
Juarez, Blaster's gonna need backup.

145
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
- Got it.
- I'll rescue Speckles.

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Hey, meathead!

147
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh, did you see that? Whoa!

148
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,600
Whoa! Whoa!

149
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's go, old buddy.

150
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Whoa!

151
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,300
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Heads up, boys!

152
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Hi-ya!

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, Juarez! You get him, girl!

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,300
We're out of here. Let's go.

155
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Something spooked the dog.
Let's check it out.

156
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,000
Blaster, Juarez, exfil.

157
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,400
By the way, in case you missed it,
I just saved your fuzzy behind.

158
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,500
We should celebrate over dinner.

159
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,100
Hang on, Speckles. We're going off-road.

160
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
Ow!

161
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,300
Gas!

163
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,600
Whew! OK. We're clear.

164
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,500
That was a little heavy
on the smoke, Ben.

165
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,400
Yo, Juarez, did you catch the little
leg twitch at the end of my "death"?

166
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Ah! That was acting, baby.
I was feeling it!

167
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,200
Yes, amazing.
Tell me you are not part possum.

168
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,100
OK, you can laugh now, but some of
those people back there were crying.

169
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,000
It was like the end of Old Yeller.

170
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,600
Mooch! You made it. Good.
How'd it go in there, guys?

171
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,500
The game's over for Saber. It's all
there. Clusterstorm, everything.

172
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Our training finally paid off.

173
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,200
I knew you could do this.
This is great.

174
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,600
- G-Force!
- G-Force?

175
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,500
I figured we need a name. Like,
you know, Green Berets or Navy SEALs.

176
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Come on. G-Force!

177
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,400
- Um, no.
- The pose is cute.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,600
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah, it's getting there.

179
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,100
Good. Feds won't be able to
shut us down with this evidence.

180
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,300
Does this make me look fatter?

181
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,900
- No. I think you look nice.
- How much longer, Speckles?

182
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,000
Just a few more touches to decode
Saber's crypto-system.

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,400
To access the information
on Darwin's PDA,

184
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,600
I have to factor a univariate
polynomial over a finite field.

185
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,300
OK. Hey, do I look fat in this?
I haven't worn a jacket since the prom.

186
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,600
You look very... sharp.

187
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,900
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

188
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,300
Huh! Huh!

189
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
"Because he's so not interested. "

190
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
What does that mean?

191
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Men are like government bonds.

192
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,700
They take way too long to mature.

193
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,000
But if you're a woman
trying to make it in a man's world,

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,500
you have to learn to think
like they do and keep them guessing.

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Candygram.

196
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
Juarez?

197
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,100
I heard over the wire
that you're interested.

198
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
I'm not interested.

199
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,900
That's not what you told Blaster.

200
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,100
Don't you get it?
I want him interested in me.

201
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,900
And he'll only be interested
if he thinks I'm not.

202
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,200
But you are interested?

203
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
- Of course.
- But not in me.

204
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,200
No, no, no. Because you know
you could have me,

205
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,100
which makes you not interested,

206
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,300
and that means I wouldn't be
interested in you even if I were.

207
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,900
OK, everybody, they're here.

208
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,100
G- Force, in your positions.
It's showtime.

209
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Hello.

210
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,600
Director Killian?

211
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
I'm Ben.

212
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,200
Congratulations on becoming the
new task force director. That's neat.

213
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,700
Let's save the chitchat.

214
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
Time is money.

215
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
OK.

216
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,700
Many people don't know
that since the Civil War

217
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
animals have been used
to gather strategic intelligence.

218
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Now, our work focuses on
developing communication

219
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
between humans and animals. Now, these
cockroaches right here have been trained

220
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,300
to carry microcameras
into surveillance zones,

221
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,800
which is, I think, really kind of neat.

222
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,000
Congratulations. Dr. Kendall, do you
mean to tell me that Homeland Security

223
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
is financing a roach motel?

224
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
This is a rodent.

225
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,900
Guinea pig, sir. Don't say that.
They get highly offended.

226
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know their DNA is 98.7 percent
identical to humans, right?

227
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
No. How would I know that?

228
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
So you'll notice the extremely
developed sense of motor skills.

229
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,700
That's because their brains
have close to a billion neurons,

230
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,900
and a trillion synapses.

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
That's a thousand times stronger
than any supercomputer.

232
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,400
It gives them exceptional, like,
eye-hand reflexes.

233
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,600
It's a video game.

234
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,500
Yeah. And there's something over here...
OK, we'll go over here.

235
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,800
You're really
gonna be amazed by this.

236
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,800
It's a language decoder.

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,900
It enables animals to talk to humans.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,700
Without it, they sound like
normal animals. Go ahead, take a look.

239
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,300
You're Doctor Dolittle.
You talk to animals.

240
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,800
Talking to animals is the easy part.

241
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,000
Getting them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

242
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,100
- Darwin! Juarez! Blaster!
- So these guys are special agents?

243
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Yeah, just like we're gonna be.

244
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,500
- Hey, how you doing?
- Whoa. That's impossible.

245
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,100
No, no, no. Finding something that
fits me off the rack, that's impossible.

246
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,400
Think that's something? Check out
Speckles. He's been decrypting the file.

247
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
- Who's Speckles?
- Our mole.

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Star-nosed breed. Blind as a bat.

249
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,500
IQ off the charts.
He's lucky I found him.

250
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,300
- His family was exterminated.
- We're ready.

251
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Last night, G-Force was able to get

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,300
some intelligence regarding
Project Clusterstorm.

253
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
You ran a mission
without my authorization?

254
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
Yes. We went to Saber's mansion and...

255
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,600
Wait a second, you broke into
Leonard Saber's house?

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,900
We accomplished in one night what
you guys couldn't do in two years.

257
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,200
And without a warrant. Holla.

258
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,400
Blaster, cool it.

259
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,800
I knew we were up for review, and I
wanted to show you what we could do.

260
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
All right, then show me. What'd you get?

261
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,600
Speckles, you're on.

262
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,800
- Darwin's PDA contains classified...
- Just open it.

263
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,600
What is it?

264
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,600
- A cappuccino machine?
- What? That's not right.

265
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
I downloaded the Clusterstorm file,
not plans for a coffee machine.

266
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,900
Oh.

267
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,600
- Right computer, wrong file.
- Darwin, what happened?

268
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,900
Specks, show them the Clusterstorm file.

269
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,600
Well, this is all we have. I'm sorry.

270
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,900
No, that's not it! It's about
global extermination. I saw it.

271
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,300
That's it, Kendall. Outside... now.

272
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,800
What a surprise.
The guinea pig mission didn't work out.

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm shutting you down.

274
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, I can.

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,300
You performed an unauthorized infil,

276
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,900
compromised a two-year
undercover FBI operation,

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
and came out with the crucial intel
that Leonard Saber,

278
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,300
and stand by for this,
makes coffee machines.

279
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,300
This means we're in big trouble now.

280
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
- Shh! Callate ya!
... a bit drastic?

281
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,200
You have to admit,
I've done some amazing things

282
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,100
as far as animal intelligence in there.

283
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
Thanks to you, those rodents can speak.
But sadly that means they're now capable

284
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,400
of exposing the derelict activities
committed on my watch.

285
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
- Yeah, but I...
- No!

286
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm not gonna take the heat
for this, Kendall.

287
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm not going down in Washington
as the crazy gopher guy.

288
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,700
Dr. Kendall's coming with me.
Cage anything that moves.

289
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,600
- Cage? Oh, no!
- What about my team here?

290
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
Here's an idea.

291
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Since they're guinea pigs,
why don't we use them as guinea pigs?

292
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,100
- What?
- Oh, no.

293
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,300
Uh-uh.

294
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Guys, we've got company.

295
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,500
We've got to get out of here.
The document capsules. Let's move.

296
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,300
- Vamos.
- Leave the gear behind.

297
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,700
All right, we're going native.
Lock and load.

298
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
I always wanted to say that.

299
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,300
Let's go.

300
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,700
Sorry, Speckles.
Talking animal, dead giveaway.

301
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,400
- No! No, not my glasses.
- In you go. Let's go.

302
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
No. No.

303
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
It's OK. I'll be right behind you.
Now, Marcie.

304
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,900
Good luck, team.

305
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,700
Yeow! I love my job!

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
No! No!

307
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,000
Marcie, you tell Ben
the Clusterstorm file is on that PDA.

308
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
- And you tell him this isn't over.
- OK.

309
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
What we have here
is your classic case...

310
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,200
- Be quiet. I'll distract them.
... and overspending.

311
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,600
- Bye, guys. Have fun in the lab.
- Hey, hey!

312
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,500
- Would you put that down, please?
- Put it down.

313
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
It's not working. Come on. Come on.

314
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,000
- It's empty.
- Stealth hamsters.

315
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
A special coating on the fur.

316
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,300
Light bends around them.
Renders them invisible.

317
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,900
That is ridiculous.

318
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,600
We did see hamsters talk.

319
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,600
- Now, let me see now.
- Step aside.

320
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,400
What are you doing?
Why are you letting them out?

321
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
- What?
- Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

322
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
I don't see anything.

323
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,700
On the floor...
Be careful not to step on them.

324
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,900
Whoa!

325
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,600
- What was that?
- What was what?

326
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,200
There's no such thing
as a stealth hamster.

327
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
Be cool if there were, though.

328
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Juarez, what's the situation?

329
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
FBI.

330
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,600
They got the whole lab surrounded.

331
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,900
I'll need to inspect your goods.

332
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Let's go.

333
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Yeah, 20 bags of Falfa Cravins.
Yes, I know.

334
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,500
- We can hide in here. Go, go, go!
- No, not the cage!

335
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,700
This facility's closed.
Get this delivery truck out of here.

336
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,900
- I don't do cages!
- Speckles, let go!

337
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,500
Great. Now we are locked in.

338
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,400
Whoa!

339
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,900
What do you think?
Is this the frying pan or the fire?

340
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,100
Let's all agree right now.
None of this goes on our resume.

341
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
This is Killian.

342
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,000
We're locking the building down, sir,
but the animals have all bolted.

343
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,600
If those animals bolted,
then I got a problem.

344
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,500
I want them all back,
dead or alive, zero exposure.

345
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,400
- Three guinea pigs and a mole. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

346
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,500
I've never seen
such fat animals in my life.

347
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't they have a gym around here?
A Jamba Juice or something?

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Lay off the nuggets, man.

349
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,100
All right, my furry little friends.
Welcome to your new home.

350
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,700
Good luck getting out.

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,100
- G-Force!
- Why did you just do that?

352
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I thought it might cheer us up.

353
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
You can't just blurt it out anytime.
It ruins the effect.

354
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,200
Guys, guys. Cool it.
The world's at stake.

355
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
We got to get out of here.

356
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,900
Then what? The Feds want to
turn us into guinea pigs.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,900
They'll never take us seriously.

358
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,300
Well, we did get the wrong file.

359
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,400
No, I downloaded the right file,
and we're gonna prove it

360
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,100
as soon as we find a way out of here.

361
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,400
Well let's ask that guy.
He looks cute and friendly.

362
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,000
Excuse me,
my incarcerated little friend.

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
- May I ask you a question?
- Don't move!

364
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,200
All I'm saying is, know your place,
behind this line. That's all I'm saying.

365
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,600
Is he talking to us?

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
Did someone order a knuckle sandwich?
Because I'm about to make a delivery.

367
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Wow. You talk a lot of smack
for a little guy, buddy.

368
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
"Buddy?" No.
For your information, it's "Bucky. "

369
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,400
And if you want to stay alive,
do not cross that line!

370
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Take cover!

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,500
Ew! The horror! The horror!

372
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,300
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning!

373
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,900
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a quarter ferret.

374
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,400
I have no ferret in me, Hurley.
That has never been proven.

375
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,700
Then why are you marked down?

376
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm on sale!
Everyone goes on sale eventually.

377
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,900
This should come as no surprise, but
he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.

378
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,600
- Mice are on sale. Everybody's on sale.
- Enough with the line already.

379
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,100
We agreed this was my zone.
We all agreed that, right?

380
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
- Right.
- The mice will agree to anything.

381
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
- You guys are all idiots, right?
- Right!

382
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,700
Oh, yeah? Fine!

383
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,700
- Yeah, he's very sensitive.
- Not a ferret!

384
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,600
- Welcome, my friends, to the family.
- Um, where is the bathroom?

385
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Well, for me, this morning,

386
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,300
the sports page, which is
pretty much where you're standing.

387
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,700
- Nasty!
- Look, don't worry.

388
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,500
They put down newspaper every day,
there's plenty to read.

389
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,700
Hey, hey, hey.
We don't have time for this.

390
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,000
- Locate escape options.
- OK, here we go. Stand back!

391
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
- I'm gonna break the glass.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

392
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,900
Ah! Oof!

393
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,000
This might be a good time for a nap.

394
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,100
OK. The truth is my grandmother met
a ferret at the San Diego petting zoo,

395
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,300
but nothing happened. They simply dated.

396
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,700
My papers say hamster, end of story.

397
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Now stop looking at the line!

398
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,900
Darwin, please let me
pull his tongue out.

399
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,200
Negative. Nobody touches the ferret.

400
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,300
I am not a ferret!

401
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,600
You try to pull my tongue out,
you'll see what happens...

402
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's check that lock.

403
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,900
G- Force, Delta formation.

404
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,700
You guys from the circus or something?

405
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,500
- Yippee! The circus!
- I hate the circus.

406
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,200
No, we're not from the circus.

407
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,900
We're specially bred,
genetically altered,

408
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,500
- and highly trained secret agents.
- Known as G-Force!

409
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,000
I get it. You guys are transfers
from the Hollywood store.

410
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,300
Darwin, it's locked.

411
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,200
We need another way out.

412
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,500
Mooch!
Go find Ben and report our location.

413
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Clusterstorm launch is in... 29 hours.

414
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,200
Wait. Who's Mooch?

415
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,300
- The fly.
- Oh, man. Talking to the flies.

416
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,500
And I thought the ferret was crazy.

417
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Yahoo!

418
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,800
What happened in there?

420
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,300
Well, I told them
we shouldn't be shut down.

421
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,700
And then I got to the bit
where I talk to guinea pigs,

422
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,900
- and then that's where I lost 'em.
- Darwin told me, before he left,

423
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,100
that he was positive
he downloaded the right file.

424
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
Where is the PDA?

425
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,700
- It's still back at the warehouse.
- Well, we gotta go get it.

426
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,200
Security's probably
crawling all over the place.

427
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,700
- That's all right. I've got an idea.
- OK, what do we do about the G-Force?

428
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,000
They're highly professional. They're
probably halfway back to my house.

429
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,900
Now, Hurley.

430
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,000
Blaster, why don't you
leave the tactics to me?

431
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,300
- OK. No problem.
- So, Farty, how do you get adopted?

432
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,200
It's pretty simple. Act cute,
kid picks you out, takes you home,

433
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,400
and bingo, you're part of the family.

434
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,000
Except that, well, they never pick me.

435
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Incoming.

436
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,100
Huddle up. OK, bring it in.

437
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
First, we get adopted. Then we escape.

438
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,700
Ben's house is the rendezvous point.
Now, go act cute.

439
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,100
Who's acting?

440
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,400
Check it out. I'm chasing my butt.
How cute is that?

441
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,100
- Come on, Specks. You, too. Act cute.
- I don't have that kind of range.

442
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,000
Ew. Grandpa, what is that?

443
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,600
That's a hideous crime
against nature, I'd say.

444
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm outta here.

445
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,000
- What can I help you with, young lady?
- I want a hamster.

446
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,900
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

447
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,900
- Her. With the big cheeks.
- Huh? What?

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,900
- I could put bows in her hair.
- What?

449
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm the hamster. They're guinea pigs!

450
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,700
- Whoa, whoa! Watch the hands, buddy.
- One oversized hamster. There you go.

451
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,600
You try to put a bow on me,
you're gonna lose a finger.

452
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,400
That little girl
has no idea what she's in for!

453
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,600
I'm gonna put nail polish
and lipstick on her and a dress.

454
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,400
A dress?
You're going to lose your whole hand.

455
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,900
Juarez, remember.

456
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,500
I know. Maintain my cover
until I have a chance to escape.

457
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,900
What about that little fur ball there?
He looks like he's full of life.

458
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,100
- No, no. Give me the fat one.
- I'm not fat. I'm fluffy.

459
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,100
Even if you forget to feed this guy
every now and then,

460
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,300
it wouldn't bother him.

461
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,000
- He's a little plump as it is.
- That's probably a good thing.

462
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Oh, mama! This is it. This is it!

463
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,700
- What do these fellas eat?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

464
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,400
- Come on, Penny.
- See you on the outside!

465
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,100
Hey, guys, I can see my future!
It's all cakes and cuddles!

466
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
I think he's gonna
throw him in with the snake.

467
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,500
Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Oh!

468
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,900
Whee!

469
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Make way. Hamster coming through.

470
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,700
Oh! Ah!

471
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,500
You're lucky I'm not in there,
snake boy,

472
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
because it would've been
lights out for you!

473
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,800
I would've hit you so hard
you would have shed yourself.

474
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,500
Then I would have turned you
into a nice pair of snakeskin boots.

475
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
That kid's a monster.
He just lifted him up and... whoa!

476
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
- Come on, kid.
- Blaster, do something.

477
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,300
- What do you suggest I do?
- Poop in his hand. Poop in his hand.

478
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Hey, Grandpa, changed my mind.

479
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, no, no, not upside down,
not upside down. Hold him like this.

480
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Where did...
Where did the chubby one go?

481
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't know.

482
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,600
All right, Specks. We have to think
of a way out of here.

483
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,200
There you are.

484
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,800
I knew you were trouble.
I can see it in your eyes.

485
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
At 0920 local time,

486
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,200
Saber initiated a call to the usual
recipient, Mr. Yanshu, in Beijing.

487
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,600
He left a message saying the launch
was on track for Project Clusterstorm.

488
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,800
Since then, nothing.

489
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
Kip, our FISA tap just isn't cutting it.

490
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,900
Sir, with respect, if you were
to authorize a search warrant...

491
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,100
On what grounds?

492
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,500
I can't authorize a search warrant
without probable cause, and he knows it.

493
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,300
Saber comes from
the defense supply industry.

494
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
- He knows how to cover his tracks.
- Sir...

495
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,700
Just give me cause,
and I can authorize. Keep listening.

496
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,600
- We are listening, sir.
- Son, listen harder.

497
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,600
Careful. Ow!

498
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,700
- Come here.
- No, por favor.

499
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,300
No, not pink. And it stinks!

500
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,200
This has to be against
the Geneva Convention.

501
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,700
Where is Blaster?
We have to get out of here.

502
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
I think you need lipstick, too.

503
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
- Yech!
- The tiara.

504
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,300
Enough already.
This is the tenth outfit.

505
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,200
Don't you look pretty?

506
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,600
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

507
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Let me do this, Specks.
I'll come back and get you.

508
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,200
Relax. They told me
one of the mice died last week,

509
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,900
and was buried in the backyard.

510
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,400
Once I'm in the ground,
I can tunnel to freedom and rescue you.

511
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Terrell! Oh, man.

512
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,100
- Terrell!
- Mamacita, relax.

513
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,500
Esta muerto.

514
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,100
It's dead.

515
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,900
- Yeah, you're right. It is.
- Do something.

516
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,300
Wow. This woman's really abrasive.

517
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,600
You get it out of here before
it starts to smell up my shop. Hurry up.

518
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,600
- Just run take it out back right now.
- I am. It's squishy.

519
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,800
Trash truck.
Let's just get it on out of here pronto.

520
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,200
That's not the plan.
No, no, no. Speckles, no!

521
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,500
Hold it.
Good luck, rest in peace and all that.

522
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Oh, no!

523
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh, my God!

524
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,400
No, no, no.

525
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,900
- Is this OK?
- Yeah, this is good.

526
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,500
OK, Harry.

527
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,500
You know what to do.

528
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,800
- She was way cuter than the other one.
- Definitely.

529
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Ah!

530
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,500
OK, he's got it. He's got the PDA.

531
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,400
What the hell was that?!

532
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
OK, I got him. I got him.

533
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,400
- Let's go. Just stay calm, OK?
- Whoa, whoa. I got him. Here he is.

534
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Look on the bright side: At
least you haven't been marked down yet.

535
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
What's that on your butt?

536
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,000
It's a birthmark.
Never seen a birthmark?

537
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,900
I have seen that birthmark.
Look at this. I got the same one.

538
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,100
Don't point that thing at me.
It might go off.

539
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,400
Seriously, just look at my butt.
You see? You see? We must be related.

540
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,400
No. I am a genetically
engineered super spy.

541
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,300
Ben spent years training us. We do
things that people only dream of doing.

542
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,800
Yeah. That's what they want you
to think. So you'll do tricks for them.

543
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,200
But you, my friend,
are a common, everyday

544
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,400
pet shop guinea pig just like me.
We must have been separated at birth.

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,300
But fate has brought us back together,
my brother.

546
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,000
- Don't say that.
- I have a brother.

547
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
- Don't say that word.
- I have a brother! Come here, brother.

548
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Come here, brother.

549
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,700
All right. My brother doesn't like hugs.
I'm good with that.

550
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,800
I am not your brother.

551
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Listen. Darwin,
I'm not gonna dress it up, OK?

552
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I sit here every day
hoping to get adopted, to find family.

553
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,700
And now, because of you,
family has found me.

554
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,100
Hurley, there is no way
that we are related,

555
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,700
so just get that
through your head, OK?

556
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,200
OK. Here we go.

557
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,800
Darwin was right.
The file was marked "Clusterstorm. "

558
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
- Can you open this?
- I don't know.

559
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
OK, well, we've already seen that.

560
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,100
OK, just unplug the computer.
Unplug. Go, go, go.

561
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,000
- Was that a worm?
- Nope.

562
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,200
This PDA is infected
with an extermination virus.

563
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Yes!

564
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,600
What is going on in there?

565
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,800
No, no, no! Not the line, not the line.
Don't cross the line.

566
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
Mm!

567
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Busted.

568
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,500
Can I offer you something?
A macadamia nut perhaps?

569
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,000
So, this is why I never saw you eat.
Not once in all these years.

570
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,200
All these treats and you never shared?

571
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,700
You think I wanted to spend my nights
sneaking out to feed myself?

572
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Starving by day and
praying for night to come

573
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,900
so I could take a bite without the
threat of you eating everything I have?

574
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,700
You drove me to this!

575
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,500
Uh-oh.

576
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,600
My friend Speckles
got crushed in a garbage truck,

577
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,700
and you said nothing about this.

578
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Uh-oh.

579
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,900
I'm outta here.

580
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,600
- Darwin? I want you to go.
- I am going.

581
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,800
You can't worry about me. You got a job
to do. You can't jeopardize it for me.

582
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
- I wasn't going to.
- You're only saying that

583
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,500
so I won't have to feel the pain so bad
when you leave.

584
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Keep believing that.
Whatever works for you.

585
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,200
Oh, what a guy. What a guy!

586
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
- OK, OK. Listen, Hurley.
- You got to go, man.

587
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,100
- I got to go. You got to let go.
- You got to go.

588
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
- I've got to let go.
- Let go of me.

589
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,400
- OK.
- OK.

590
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Don't give up the dream.

591
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,500
You're gonna find the family
you're looking for someday.

592
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,800
So long.

593
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
So long, brother!

594
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,200
I miss him already.

595
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,000
Whoa! Ah!

596
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,600
Good luck with the climb back up,
Hurley! The cage is mine!

597
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,700
And it's all true.
My grandfather was a ferret!

598
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,300
Now who's been marked down?

599
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,200
So, there's the North Star,
which means Ben's is east.

600
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,100
OK, I need to head that way.

601
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,100
Go back, Hurley.

602
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,200
Fine!
You think I can't make it out here?

603
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,200
You think you're the only one
who can survive in the big bad world?

604
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,800
Well, the truth is, Hurley is out of
his cage, and it's time to hit the town!

605
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,600
Guinea pigs gone wild! Woo-hoo! Yeah!

606
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,200
Ah!

607
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Darwin!

608
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Darwin? I saw a cat.

609
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,800
OK, you can come with me
until we find another pet shop.

610
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh, thanks bro. Did I mention
I'm also afraid of the dark?

611
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Greetings,
Mr. Saber. I have a status report.

612
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,800
You are a brilliant
business partner, Mr. Yanshu.

613
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,100
But remind me why we call these things
"video" conferences.

614
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,600
As we've discussed, it's in everyone's
best interest my identity remain hidden.

615
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,600
Project Clusterstorm
is perfectly on course, sir.

616
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,100
Sabersense will activate
in about 19 hours.

617
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,400
Why are we spending a large amount
of money tracking space junk?

618
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,900
Old satellites. Booster rockets.

619
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,400
Four million pounds of debris.
And why do we care?

620
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,800
The satellites, sir.
Communication systems.

621
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,500
We have to protect them. Integral aspect
of the Sabersense network.

622
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,300
We've got a lot riding on this, Yanshu.

623
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,500
I've put my trust
in your engineering skills.

624
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,100
- Mooch, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah!

625
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,900
Are the others OK?

626
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,100
- You know where they are?
- Yeah!

627
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,100
You want help with that?

628
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,800
E... I... I...

629
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,900
...a... oh, yeah.

630
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,600
Oh, Mooch... You're a genius.

631
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,200
I was so worried about you.
I don't like when my fly is down.

632
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,300
Hey, Marcie?
Yeah, it's Ben. I found them.

633
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,900
I'll be by in ten minutes
to pick you up.

634
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,500
There's the delivery truck from the lab.

635
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,900
Como estas, gentlemen?

636
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,400
We're looking for some rodents.

637
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,700
Si, for you or for your children?

638
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,700
For the government.

639
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,700
- We're special agents.
- What? Yeah, right.

640
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,200
Are they fugitives
or terrorists or something?

641
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,800
Just answer the question.

642
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,700
OK, sorry. I'm just saying, you look
like a regular guinea pig to me.

643
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,700
Listen, I told you, I'm a commando
who just happens to be a guinea pig.

644
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,100
Oh, yeah?
So where's all your fancy spy gear?

645
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,600
Back at the lab.

646
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,800
Oh. Same lab where I keep
my hot Canadian guinea pig girlfriend?

647
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,800
That's where my stuff is, too.

648
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,500
I have a unicorn back there
and a dragon that I ride around.

649
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,100
Look, if you want to stick with me,
stop with the yapping and keep up.

650
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,700
No can do, bro.
I'm calling a hunger strike.

651
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,200
And I am not moving an inch. Whoa!

652
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,400
Uh-oh. Whoa!

653
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,900
Eh, civilians. Come on, soggy.

654
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm hungry, I'm wet, I'm hungry...

655
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,700
Shh!

656
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,700
Dogs!

657
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Dogs. Why does it always
have to be dogs?

658
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,200
All right, MacGyver,
you got any brilliant ideas?

659
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,900
Yeah, I got an idea.

660
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,000
- I think we made it.
- Great. How do we stop it?

661
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
Just keep running.

662
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,000
That's not how you stop it!
That's how you make it go!

663
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
- Hurley, get your butt outta my face.
- Get your face outta my butt!

664
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,000
Ow!

665
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,300
So this is what spies do.

666
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
Como estas, chica?

667
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,100
We're looking for
three guinea pigs and a mole.

668
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,000
Same one as the Feds,
or are yours from a rival militia?

669
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Wait, what Feds?

670
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,900
Men in Black were here
looking for the same thing.

671
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,700
Wanted to know who had bought them.

672
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,000
And did you tell them?

673
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
No, I refused and we shot it out.
What do you think? It's the Feds!

674
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,300
Thank you.

675
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Mine! The cage is mine!

676
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,800
This is gonna be awesome.

677
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,500
I'm pretty sure this is
animal cruelty, but I love it!

678
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,200
Yeah!

679
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,500
Yeah!

680
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,400
This wheel doesn't work!

681
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
Strike!

682
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,900
- Ah!
- Ooh!

683
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
- Is that all you got?
- Ready to go for the record?

684
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,900
Maybe this would be a good time
for you to take your medication!

685
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,600
I feel the need... the need for speed!

686
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,400
Whoo-hoo!

687
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,000
Say cheese!

688
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,500
Whoa!

689
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Excuse me! Coming through!

690
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,000
- Yeah!
- Yes!

691
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,500
- That was off the hizz-ook!
- Connor! Take out the trash.

692
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,200
OK.

693
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,600
- Now!
- I'm coming!

694
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,600
What do we have here?

695
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,600
You, my friend, suck.

696
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,700
I'm coming for you, Juarez. Whoa!

697
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,500
Whoa!

698
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,200
That's what I'm talking about!

699
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,900
Time for a joyride.

700
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,700
Yeah!

701
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,000
Get out the road, fool!

702
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,200
- Hey!
- Don't become roadkill!

703
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,700
I ain't used to driving stick!

704
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,400
- Oops! Not this time!
- Stop it. Stop it! Come back!

705
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,300
I'll come back when you're older
and put you in prison!

706
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,200
- Get over here!
- Don't go anywhere.

707
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
- I'll be right back.
- Finally!

708
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,000
Hi-ya!

709
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,800
- Juarez! Where are you?
- Connor, get him!

710
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,800
I have to save his fur again?

711
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,500
Juarez?

712
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,100
Juarez!

713
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,200
Yeah!

714
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,500
Woo-hoo!

715
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,300
I got you!

716
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,700
Why are you dressed like
"Guinea Pig Barbie?"

717
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,400
One more word and I'll turn you
into a small side of bacon.

718
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, you are sizzling hot!

719
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,300
Connor!

720
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Get this off of me!

721
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,800
Don't need that, or that, or that!

722
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,400
- Although, maybe this can stay.
- Juarez, you are fine china!

723
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,800
What exactly are we doing, anyway?

724
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,800
Two days ago, my team embarked on a
mission. Today, I'm gonna finish it.

725
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,900
My brother's a loon!
I love him, but he's...

726
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,400
Cake! Did I tell you I love cake?
Oh! Oh, I've heard of places like this!

727
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,900
They sell something called "layer cake!"

728
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,800
It's not just one cake,
it's many, in layers!

729
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,400
Often up to six!
Oh, it is the Holy Grail of human food!

730
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,400
I can't believe you're getting
so excited about cake. Coffeemaker!

731
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,300
That's the same coffeemaker
that was on the Clusterstorm file.

732
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Hurley, I got to check out
that coffeemaker. Stay close.

733
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,000
Fifty billion rodents in the world,
and I get stuck with this guy.

734
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,100
Whoa.

735
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,800
I hope you're keeping track
of all these parts.

736
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,400
Don't watch me. Watch my back.

737
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,400
Right now, you're my eyes and ears.
Just act natural.

738
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,100
- OK. Sure.
- Look, Daddy!

739
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,500
Hi there. Hi.

740
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,400
- That wasn't very convincing.
- Hurley, do you know what this is?

741
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's called vandalism.

742
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,100
This is a military grade,
multiple array transceiver

743
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,800
developed for the military's
Unmanned Weapons Program.

744
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,100
Sorry, I tuned out there.
What were you saying?

745
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
I gotta get this chip back to Ben's.

746
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,800
OK, that's weird.

747
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,600
Hurley, duck!

748
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,500
Stay down!

749
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,600
Whoa!

750
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,400
I've heard coffee's bad for you,
but this is ridiculous!

751
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,700
Come on, move it!

752
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,100
- Why are we stopping?
- We're gonna fight it.

753
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,700
We're gonna do what?

754
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,700
We have to get that chip.

755
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,200
Whoa!

756
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
Good luck with that!

757
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,300
Uh-oh.

758
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,700
- Suck in your gut!
- I am!

759
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

760
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Darwin!

761
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,900
Hang on, Hurley!

762
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,400
Yippee-ki-yay, coffeemaker!

763
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,800
Watch out, bro!

764
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,700
You want some of this,
you overgrown can opener?

765
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,600
Don't think the warranty
is gonna cover that.

766
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,900
Oh, brother. I thought I lost you there.

767
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,100
OK, thanks Hurley! Boundaries!

768
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,800
Talk about a killer cappuccino.
What is this thing?

769
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,000
This is Clusterstorm.

770
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,100
Saber must be weaponizing
his entire line of appliances.

771
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,800
We have to get this back to Ben's.

772
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,000
How are we gonna do that?

773
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,800
Hey, bro? You have to admit,
we make a pretty sweet team.

774
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,800
I could get used to all this
"secret agent" stuff

775
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,900
if you're ever looking
for a new recruit.

776
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,300
Hurley, just be quiet and lean right.

777
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,200
Look who I found out back.

778
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,100
- Blaster! Juarez!
- Darwin! You made it.

779
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,200
- Hurley, what are you doing here?
- Hey, guys!

780
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,300
Hurley, up high. Down low. Too slow.

781
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,400
Wait a minute. Where's Speckles?

782
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,400
Speckles didn't make it.

783
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,400
- What do you mean, he didn't make it?
- He was gonna break out

784
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,400
and engineer our escape,
but then the mission went bad.

785
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,600
He got crushed in a garbage truck.

786
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,600
- Oh, Speckles. Jeez.
- He sacrificed himself for us.

787
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,900
This is all my fault.

788
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,700
Ben, there's nothing you could've done.

789
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,200
No, I could've told you the truth
of who you really are.

790
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,500
Darwin, I misled you.

791
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,700
The truth is,
you're not genetically engineered.

792
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,600
Any of you.

793
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,400
I should've never... should've never
sent you out into the field. It's...

794
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,700
So we are not special at all?

795
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,200
No engineering? No enhancements?

796
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,300
We're just common, ordinary rodents?

797
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,400
I wanted you guys to think of yourselves
as more than just balls of fur

798
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,900
waiting for your next pellet.

799
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,300
Well, maybe you can
explain that to Speckles.

800
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,800
Ben, we need to know.
Tell us who we are.

801
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,000
OK, you guys want to know?

802
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:02,100
Juarez, we rescued you at a
roadside tapas stand in the Pyrenees.

803
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,200
I guess there
you're some kind of, you know, delicacy.

804
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,200
Ai-yai-yai.

805
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,900
Blaster, we found you
at a cosmetics company.

806
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,200
They were testing, you know, some kind
of hair gel for allergic reactions.

807
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,900
And Speckles we found...

808
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,900
...you know, right before his
home was dug out to build a golf course.

809
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,700
And, Darwin, I...

810
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,900
I purchased you at a pet store.

811
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,800
Your parents abandoned you
because you were the runt of the litter.

812
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,600
I was a runt? What do you mean?

813
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,800
I never even had a chance.

814
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,500
This is Carter.

815
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,700
OK, we're on it.

816
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,200
Dispatch just got a report of two giant
hamsters riding a skateboard on Pacific.

817
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,200
Let's finish this.

818
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,000
You were right all along. I am just an
average, everyday pet store guinea pig.

819
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,800
Since when did you
start listening to me?

820
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,400
My parents didn't even want me.

821
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,500
Look, Darwin, you saved us from
the dogs, you defeated the Terminator,

822
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,000
read the stars like a map
and got us here.

823
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,900
I couldn't have done any of that.

824
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,900
Do you have any idea how many guinea
pigs could've done all those things?

825
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,800
I mean, literally, like three.
And they're all in this room.

826
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,600
Yeah, you're right.

827
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,600
I may not be genetically engineered,
but I'm no house pet, either.

828
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,300
Hey team, come over here. Listen up.
What Ben did was right.

829
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,400
He wanted us to believe in ourselves.
And we did believe.

830
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,200
We still have our training,
our abilities.

831
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,100
Blaster, you're a graduate
of West Point.

832
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah, correspondence course.

833
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah, whatever. And Juarez, how many
hours have you put in on that simulator?

834
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,700
Two hundred... thousand.

835
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Uh!

836
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,500
I helped with the tire!

837
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,400
We may be guinea pigs,
but we're not ordinary. We're special.

838
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,500
I still believe in us,
even if nobody else does.

839
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,600
I believe.

840
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,500
I believe.

841
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,000
I've always believed.

842
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,600
Ben, we don't have much time.
That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.

843
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,200
When I tried to disconnect this chip,
it came alive and it attacked us.

844
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,300
It was so gnarly!

845
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,700
If I hadn't been there to take
cover fire for Darwin, who knows...

846
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,900
Oh!

847
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,600
The Sabersense microchip
caused it to transform.

848
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,200
Ben, Sabersense and Clusterstorm
are the same thing.

849
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,100
And if every Saber product
in the world has that chip,

850
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,700
that means that every appliance on Earth
is gonna be a killing machine.

851
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,400
Guys...

852
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,700
Sabersense launches in... 30 minutes.

853
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,300
I tried to access the
Clusterstorm file on your PDA,

854
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,800
but Saber, he protected it
with some nasty virus.

855
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,000
I mean, I'm a little bit at a loss.

856
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Sorry to interrupt. Quick question.

857
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,700
If that little thingamabob
is all that like you say it is,

858
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,400
why don't you just use that
to destroy Saber's mainframe?

859
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
I'll go back in the box. Oh, pepperoni!

860
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,800
- That could work. That could work!
- OK, let's do this!

861
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,700
Wait a second.
We don't have our equipment.

862
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,300
Well, that's not entirely true.

863
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,200
This is a little prototype
I've been working on

864
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,900
called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle.

865
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,600
She'll do 65
with the throttle wide open.

866
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,100
And, Blaster, it has a rocking stereo.

867
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,100
That's what's up! Pimp my ride!

868
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,100
All right, we got gear.
And we know our mission.

869
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,700
Infiltrate Saber's mansion,
locate the main network core

870
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
and dock this infected PDA.

871
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,200
Bring down big mama with baby disease.

872
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,200
I don't know what that means.
But, yeah, that's good.

873
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,900
Here are the keys.

874
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,700
- Don't scratch it.
- All right. This is for Speckles.

875
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,200
Dr. Kendall, we know you're in there!
Open the door!

876
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,300
Everybody, into the RDV!
You, too, Hurley. Move it!

877
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,300
Shotgun!

878
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,500
Open the door, or we'll open it for you!

879
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,300
Hold on.

880
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,700
Don't these fools
know we're on the same team?

881
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,500
- Juarez, plot us a course to Saber's.
- I'm on it.

882
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,200
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

883
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,300
Mooch, we need eyes in the sky.

884
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,500
Call for backup.

885
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,900
Tell them we're in pursuit of three
guinea pigs driving mobile spheres.

886
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
OK!

887
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,700
Actually, could you make that call?

888
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,000
My stomach doesn't do well
with action-adventure.

889
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,900
Hurley, don't you dare.

890
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,300
Yuck, Hurley. That's disgusting.

891
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,500
- I can't breathe.
- Roll down the window.

892
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,700
- These things don't have windows!
- That's real professional, guys.

893
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,800
Mooch, where's that recon?

894
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,200
- OK, here come the bad guys.
- Better have their "A" game.

895
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,600
- Yeah!
- Mommy!

896
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Where's that backup?

897
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,700
- May I ask why we're chasing rodents?
- No, you may not.

898
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,000
OK, you can just
let me out at the next corner.

899
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,800
We got three party crashers on our tail.

900
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,300
- Hurry up! You're losing them!
- They're boxing us in!

901
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,500
- Yeah, I got 'em, I got 'em.
- Maybe they want to adopt us!

902
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,400
Not likely, Hurley. Hold on, guys!

903
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,300
- Let's just crush 'em!
- Unlock it and rock it. Now!

904
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,100
- Time to divide and conquer.
- See ya!

905
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,600
- Oh, yeah! Come and get me!
- Where'd he go?

906
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,500
- How low can you go?
- There he goes! Under the trailer!

907
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,800
Little is the new big!

908
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,600
Bye-bye, bipeds! Smell you later!

909
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,600
- I want to go back to the pet store!
- You might want to buckle up.

910
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,600
He paid for undercoating. What a sucker!

911
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,200
Let's see if it protects him from this.

912
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,500
- Hey, what's that?
- This is my little friend.

913
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,800
- Say hello.
- Hello!

914
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,800
And goodbye!

915
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,200
Better hang on to your lunch!

916
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,600
Did we win?

917
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,200
This is Unit Two. We lost them.

918
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,100
How? You're driving a V-8. They're
rolling around in little plastic balls.

919
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,300
This one's not getting away from me!

920
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Darwin, I need some help here.

921
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,900
Mooch, I need a visual on Juarez.

922
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,500
- I can't get these guys off my tail.
- We don't have tails.

923
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,500
Hang on, Juarez. Hurley, we're
going to the fair. Blaster, hard right.

924
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,200
All right, Juarez.
Let's take it to the house!

925
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,500
OK, I'm taking the lead.

926
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,600
- You're scaring me!
- Shut it, Carter!

927
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,000
Here's that box of M-80s.
Careful with these.

928
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,900
- You're driving angry!
- Yes, I am!

929
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,800
Come here, you little rodent.

930
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,700
Carl, look out! Look out!

931
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,400
Let's let 'em go,
let's let 'em go! Look out!

932
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,700
- This is so festive!
- This is crazy. This is crazy!

933
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,400
These are good seats!

934
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,600
I'm gonna flatten this little varmint!

935
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,400
Mess with the bull, you get the horns.

936
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,500
Look out! Look out!

937
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,400
How you doing?

938
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,700
Don't try this at home, kids!

939
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,700
That was great!
Let's do it again.

940
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:45,700
Face it, Trigstad.
You just got out-driven by gophers.

941
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,500
- Guys, I'm going in.
- Hurley, suck in your gut.

942
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
Blaster, I need to
tell you something about Juarez.

943
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,600
You have nothing to worry about.
She's not interested in me.

944
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,400
- She told you that?
- Yeah. She really wants you...

945
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,800
She's trying to make you more interested
in her by acting disinterested.

946
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,200
Yeah, well maybe
she told you she wants me

947
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,500
in order to look not interested in you,
which makes you more interested in her.

948
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,800
Interesting.

949
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,300
Members
of the Saberling inner sanctum,

950
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,900
my co-conspirators in this endeavor,

951
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,800
are we ready to dominate?

952
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,200
Are we ready to change the world?

953
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,800
- Go, go, go, go!
- Geronimo!

954
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,700
- Yippee!
- Whoa!

955
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,300
Hurley, this is our exfil. It's very
important that you stand guard.

956
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,500
Whatever you do, don't leave this spot.
We're counting on you.

957
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,400
OK, OK. Got it.

958
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,600
Hey, does this mean
I'm part of the team?

959
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,900
There's the network core.
Behind the glass.

960
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,500
Look! We can gain access
through that panel.

961
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,600
OK, follow me.

962
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,200
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

963
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,700
It's a tripwire.

964
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,600
It's a booby trap.
Don't touch it, or this place'll blow.

965
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,700
Tick, tick, boom.

966
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,800
Ooh!

967
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,500
I don't think anybody'll mind
if I check the perimeter.

968
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,600
As I press this button,

969
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,100
we move forward
to a brave new world order

970
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,700
owned and operated by Saberling.

971
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,800
We're too late.

972
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,500
We can still stop it if we download the
virus into Saber's computer. Let's go.

973
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,100
Cherries.

974
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Cake! Oh, you're so beautiful!

975
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,100
Oh, come to Papa!

976
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,500
Uh-oh. Oh!

977
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,200
It's all Saber, sir.
Is this enough probable cause?

978
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,200
Eyewitnesses report
common household appliances

979
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,000
- coming to life and chasing people...
- Those are Saberling appliances!

980
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
But they're just supposed to
communicate with each other.

981
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,300
- Bravo, Echo! Go! Go!
- Spread out!

982
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,800
What is that thing?

983
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,300
It's heading for the tripwire.

984
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,800
- It's got Hurley!
- Oh, hey guys!

985
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,400
- What's it doing?
- Peppers. Casserole.

986
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,600
It's trying to figure out
how long to cook him.

987
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,000
Cook me? Get me out of here!

988
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,800
- Move it, Blaster!
- I don't want to be an appetizer!

989
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,900
- We got to save him!
- Get me out!

990
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,500
Let's go to Plan B!

991
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,800
- Blaster, immobilize that thing!
- I'm on it!

992
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,900
- Don't let it hit the tripwire!
- I want to go home!

993
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:59,000
Soup. Eggs. Beef.

994
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,800
- Oh, man! It's packing a toaster!
- Broccoli.

995
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,200
All teams, go, go!

996
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,500
Why is this happening?

997
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,400
This wasn't the plan!

998
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,100
- Saber, what's going on?
- Get us out of here!

999
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,200
Take Saber down to the command truck!

1000
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,000
Bacon. Carrot. Soup.

1001
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,000
- Hurley, don't be scared.
- I'm not a chicken.

1002
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,900
Chicken. Match.

1003
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,200
Uh-oh.

1004
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,300
Not even close!

1005
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,300
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a little piece of cake!

1006
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,000
- Didn't drop the cake.
- Hurley, let's go!

1007
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,500
Hunk of junk!

1008
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,500
It's gonna hit the tripwire!

1009
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,100
- Run for cover!
- Darwin, jump!

1010
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,400
No!

1011
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,800
Ah!

1012
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,100
Are you OK? We can't get through.

1013
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,100
I'm all right. I'm gonna keep going.

1014
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,200
Not without us. No way.

1015
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,300
There's no time.
I've got to take down the network core.

1016
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,600
Hurley, I told you
stay put and guard the exfil.

1017
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,700
Didn't I tell you that?
I thought I could depend on you.

1018
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,700
All right. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

1019
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,700
Good luck, Darwin.
We'll find another way through.

1020
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,700
OK, this is good. Over there.

1021
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,100
Marcie, let's go.

1022
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,600
I find it hard to believe
you've got nothing to do with this.

1023
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,200
You have to believe me.
I don't know what's going on.

1024
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,800
I only wanted to be the biggest
appliance manufacturer in the world.

1025
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,100
What do you want?
I got major problems here.

1026
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,300
There's your problem. The transmission's
coming off the core of his computer.

1027
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,600
- G-Force went in to shut it down.
- G-Force?

1028
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,300
You sent those gophers in
without my authorization?

1029
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,500
Sir, I'm picking up a video feed.
It's one of ours.

1030
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,800
Let's see it.

1031
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,200
- What in the heck is that?
- That's Darwin.

1032
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,700
You say that like it's a good thing.

1033
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,400
What's he gonna do?
Gnaw his way out of there?

1034
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,600
He's gonna insert a virus into
the core and take down the network.

1035
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,600
- Hello, Darwin.
- Speckles, you're alive.

1036
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You infiltrated the bad guy's lair.
Where is he?

1037
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,700
I am the bad guy.

1038
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,800
What? You really think I let myself
get killed in a garbage truck?

1039
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:19,200
Ha! Well I hid in a soup can.
Rode it all the way to the city dump.

1040
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,900
And it was stinky.

1041
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,700
- Speckles?
- I can't believe the mole was the mole.

1042
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,200
Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.

1043
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,200
- No.
- Business associate of Leonard Saber.

1044
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,700
You tricked Saber
into helping you build Clusterstorm?

1045
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,700
How could you do this to us?

1046
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,000
I thought we were friends.
I put my life on the line for you.

1047
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,900
Yanshu was in my basement
this whole time?

1048
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,700
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

1049
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,400
"Yanshu" is the Chinese word for mole.

1050
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,000
Sabersense was just a cover.

1051
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,700
I created an army of robotic appliances,

1052
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,600
and they created an array of
giant electromagnetic nodes...

1053
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,700
Nodes capable of pulling down all

1054
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,300
the space junk orbiting the planet,
and driving every human underground.

1055
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,100
- So, what do you think?
- You've betrayed us. You!

1056
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:19,600
- You sabotaged our presentation.
- Extermination virus. Nasty stuff.

1057
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,400
Speckles, why?

1058
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:27,400
You ever Google the word "mole" Darwin?
Three million entries.

1059
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,600
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

1060
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,500
Three million entries
on how to exterminate them!

1061
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,500
The humans came and destroyed
our home... destroyed our home.

1062
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,000
Son, if you ever get the chance

1063
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,600
to bring mankind to its knees... do it.

1064
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,900
They showed us no mercy, Darwin.

1065
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,100
Well, now it's my turn
to do a little pest control.

1066
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,500
If you'll excuse me... it's showtime.

1067
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,700
Going up!

1068
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,000
He's created some kind of monster.

1069
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,600
I think I'll stay here
and guard the exfil...

1070
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,100
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

1071
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,800
That's more
of a goal than a plan.

1072
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:36,100
It's working! Look out!
I'm feeling ten feet tall.

1073
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,100
Oh! Ah!

1074
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,300
No place like home.
There's no place like home.

1075
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,000
That'll leave a mark.

1076
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,700
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

1077
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,000
How big is this thing going to get?

1078
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,100
You humans stole my home!
Now I will steal yours.

1079
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,500
Oh-ho-ho!

1080
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,000
Look out!

1081
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,100
Something is missing. Oh, I know!

1082
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,300
Incoming!

1083
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,300
Just like humans.
Bringing guns to a space junk fight.

1084
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,000
- Darwin!
- Speckles, shut this down, now!

1085
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,100
- No.
- Then I'll shut you down.

1086
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:40,200
I have no quarrel with you, Darwin,
but mankind must pay.

1087
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,500
You know I can't let you do that.

1088
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,900
Then you leave me no choice, my friend.

1089
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,400
My parachute.

1090
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,400
The PDA!

1091
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,400
Go get it, girl.

1092
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,900
No!

1093
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Oh! Ah!

1094
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,100
Oh!

1095
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,700
Ah!

1096
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,100
Hurley, what are you doing?

1097
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,800
I gotta get you back up there.

1098
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,700
- No, Hurley! Don't do it.
- Go get him, bro! It's the only way!

1099
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,600
Coming, Hurley!

1100
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,900
Take that! And that!
It's no fun being the little guy, is it?

1101
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,700
Everybody, hold on!

1102
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,700
Fall back!

1103
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,300
Speckles, if you keep doing this

1104
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,700
then you're no better than the humans
who destroyed your home and your family.

1105
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,700
Well, that's kind of the point here.
I lost my family.

1106
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,400
No, you're wrong. We're your family.

1107
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,000
Me and Blaster
and Juarez and Ben and Marcie.

1108
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,700
Speckles, Ben took us in
when nobody else wanted us.

1109
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,900
And he made us a family.

1110
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,700
We're a family.

1111
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,100
Oh, no! No! What have I done?
What have I done?

1112
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,400
It's too late, Darwin! I can't stop it!

1113
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,900
But we can.

1114
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,500
Whoa!

1115
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,700
Ooh!

1116
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,900
It's working! Darwin, it's working!

1117
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,400
Speckles, come with me.

1118
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,400
Whoa!

1119
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,700
I got you!

1120
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,700
We've gotta find Hurley.

1121
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,200
- Hold it right there.
- We'll take him from here.

1122
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,000
Relax, guys. He's code four.

1123
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,700
- What a mess.
- There you go. Easy.

1124
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,300
- Darwin, over here!
- Hang on!

1125
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,200
- I got him. I got him.
- I can't hold it much longer.

1126
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,800
Ow!

1127
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,400
No, Hurley.

1128
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,200
No, not you, Hurley.

1129
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,000
Look,
he landed next to his cake.

1130
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,100
No.

1131
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,100
Oh, man, Hurley.

1132
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,600
- Hurley.
- Oh, no.

1133
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,200
No. No. This is all my fault.

1134
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,800
He was my man.

1135
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,400
Hurley, wake up, pal.

1136
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,400
Listen, I just...

1137
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,800
I just wanted you to know you
were as good as anyone out there today.

1138
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,100
I don't know what they call it
back in the pet shop,

1139
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,800
but out here we...
well we call it being a hero.

1140
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,500
All you ever wanted was a family.

1141
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,400
I never got to tell you this, but...

1142
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:11,000
I'd be proud...
proud to call you my brother.

1143
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,300
Hurley.

1144
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,400
Hey, I think I saw his nose twitch.

1145
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
Hurley?

1146
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,500
Did you mean it
when you called me "brother?"

1147
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,200
Not exactly. I was just...
That was like a figurative...

1148
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,600
- You bet I did.
- Brother. I have a brother!

1149
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,400
This is great!

1150
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,300
We can spend every
Thanksgiving together,

1151
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,200
take road trips to Vegas,
have tickle fights!

1152
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Oh, come here. Give me a hug, bro.

1153
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,800
Well...

1154
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,600
Oh, this is great!

1155
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,600
Oh! Mm-mm-mm!

1156
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,000
So, Hurley.
You still want to be a part of the team?

1157
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,800
Two...

1158
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,800
Three...

1159
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,700
Twenty-seven!

1160
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
- Hurley. I'm right here watching you.
- Thirty-two.

1161
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,900
OK, that's it.
I don't want to get too buff.

1162
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,500
Not to worry.

1163
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,200
Alrighty, guys.
Welcome to your new home.

1164
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,900
OK, but I'm telling you now,
I don't do well with roommates.

1165
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,400
- Easy there, tiger.
- Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

1166
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,200
Jail break! Jail break!

1167
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,900
Look, Juarez, I gotta know.
Which one of us are you interested in?

1168
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,600
No no, Blaster! You've gotta ask her
who she's not interested in.

1169
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,400
Thirty, 42, 83.

1170
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,800
As far as I can tell,
you're not interested in either of us,

1171
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,300
which means either
you want both of us or neither of us,

1172
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,100
which leaves us desperate
even though we don't have a clue!

1173
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,400
And that's just how I like it.

1174
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,800
Hey, guys?
It's the Director of the FBI.

1175
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,400
G- Force. I want you to know
that Leonard Saber

1176
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,900
has been forced to undertake the largest
recall of consumer products in history.

1177
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,600
And he's getting help from somebody
quite knowledgeable about the defects.

1178
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,700
Three down, 178,000 to go.

1179
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,700
I think I'm gonna be here a while.

1180
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,900
But I'm gonna rejoin the team
when I'm done. If they'll have me.

1181
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,200
Your, friend Agent Killian, has been
reassigned. He has a few words for you.

1182
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,100
Hello, G-Force.

1183
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,500
Look! A frozen FBl-cicle.

1184
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,900
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1185
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,300
How long do I have to stay down here?
It's really cold!

1186
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,500
Team. As the full details
of your valor come to light,

1187
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,900
it is an honor and a privilege to say
"thank you" on behalf of this country.

1188
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,100
You guinea pigs pack more courage and
heart into those teensy little frames

1189
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,200
than any agents I've ever seen.

1190
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,800
G- Force, your funding has been restored.
Welcome to the FBI.

1191
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,300
Guys... we got our badges.

1192
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,500
- Yeah, boy! We're official-tishal now!
- Finally!

1193
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,600
Not bad for a runt.

1194
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,600
Thanks for believing in me, Ben.

1195
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,200
Hurley, I've been thinking...

1196
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,600
If you're gonna be out there
helping us save the world,

1197
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,800
you're gonna need this.
You're one of us now.

1198
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:54,000
My very own badge
and a new name! Rookie!

1199
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,100
- So we're finally agents.
- No, special agents.

1200
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,200
Let's get
this party started right!

1201
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,600
Whoo!

1202
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,600
Get him on the good foot!
All right, Hurley!

1203
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,100
G- Force in the house!

1204
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,500
Whoa!

1205
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,200
Whoo!

1206
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,000
Ay-yi-yi!

1207
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,100
My turn! My turn!

1208
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,300
Whee!

1209
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,600
Hey, boys!
This ferret can dance, right? Right?

1210
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,800
Wrong!

1211
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:02,900
Oh, Bucky!

1212
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,100
Oh, yeah!

1213
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,300
I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

1214
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,800
It's a good thing I took shop.

1215
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,500
Cherries.

1216
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,200
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

1217
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:04,500
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

1218
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,900
I'm Jeff Gordon! With fur! Whoa!
