1
00:03:33.522 --> 00:03:35.357
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:37.485
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.653
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

4
00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.448
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42.573 --> 00:03:45.493
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube</i>
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

6
00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:47.411
<i>The sensors are placed.</i>
<i>I'm going back.</i>

7
00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.413
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:51.624
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.959
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:55.127
Steady.

11
00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.799
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:42.800
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.016
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51.142 --> 00:04:53.561
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:15.207
Solo.

16
00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:18.085
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.005
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.924
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:27.553
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:29.597
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:29.722 --> 00:05:32.558
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:35.019
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:36.979
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:41.066
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:41.192 --> 00:05:42.610
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:52.703
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:53.662 --> 00:05:54.705
That's right.

28
00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:59.960
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.173
Han.

30
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.053
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:12.014
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.391
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.602
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:19.188
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:21.774
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36
00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:25.402
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:28.989
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:31.700
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:34.370
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:36.122
Come on.

41
00:06:37.414 --> 00:06:39.416
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.460
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:43.796
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.507
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:48.759
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:49.802 --> 00:06:52.513
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:56.058
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.018
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:58.144 --> 00:07:00.563
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:01.897
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:05.109
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:07.361
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:09.530
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:12.158
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:12.283 --> 00:07:14.452
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:17.455
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.832
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:19.957 --> 00:07:22.751
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:24.170
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:24.295 --> 00:07:26.797
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...

61
00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:28.674
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:31.469
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:33.804
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:36.474
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.976
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:41.395
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.522
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:43.647 --> 00:07:46.692
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:58.496
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:01.081
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:03.292
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.378
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.547
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:15.805
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.973
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.696
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:37.822 --> 00:10:39.865
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.076
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.081
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:49.959
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:53.712
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:54.148
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

83
00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:58.235
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.448
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:02.573 --> 00:12:05.951
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:08.204
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:10.664
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:14.418
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.674
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:35.981
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:40.694
from time to time.

92
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.655
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:48.244
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:51.163
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:07.304 --> 00:13:08.973
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:13:10.808 --> 00:13:12.143
Luke.

97
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.193
Ben?

98
00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:23.946
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:25.823
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:29.410
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29.535 --> 00:13:33.289
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:55.144
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18.876 --> 00:14:21.170
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:28.803
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.182
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:34.975
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36.352 --> 00:14:38.270
Yoda.

108
00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:42.858
but it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:45.027
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:50.950
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:52.910
on the outside.

112
00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:38.664
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:40.708
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:45.337 --> 00:15:47.590
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:49.592
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:52.386
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:55.347
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:04.523
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

119
00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:06.484
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:09.695
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

121
00:16:10.654 --> 00:16:13.699
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:16:13.824 --> 00:16:16.410
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:50.361
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:53.197
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:53.322 --> 00:16:56.826
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:59.829
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:16:59.954 --> 00:17:03.749
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:17:03.874 --> 00:17:05.209
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:17:05.334 --> 00:17:08.420
Iooks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:10.422
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:17:10.548 --> 00:17:13.175
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.219
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:17:15.344 --> 00:17:16.595
That's a good story.

134
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.641
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:24.061
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

136
00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:29.733
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:32.945
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.322
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

139
00:17:35.448 --> 00:17:36.574
My...

140
00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:40.119
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:42.288
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:45.458
Who's scruffy-lookin'?

143
00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:52.214
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:58.804
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.730
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command centre.</i>

146
00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:13.611
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command centre.</i>

147
00:18:13.736 --> 00:18:15.696
Take it easy.

148
00:18:15.821 --> 00:18:17.865
Excuse us, please.

149
00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:22.203
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.248
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:28.626
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:18:28.751 --> 00:18:32.546
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:35.299
There's something
very weak coming through.

154
00:18:38.636 --> 00:18:41.680
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:44.934
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.983
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:53.109 --> 00:18:56.112
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

158
00:19:32.314 --> 00:19:34.358
- <i>I'm afraid there's not much left.</i>
- What was it?

159
00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:36.527
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

160
00:19:36.652 --> 00:19:40.114
- <i>Must have had a self-destruct.</i>
- An imperial probe droid.

161
00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:43.117
<i>It's a good bet the Empire</i>
<i>knows we're here.</i>

162
00:19:43.242 --> 00:19:45.453
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:20:30.456 --> 00:20:32.958
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:20:34.376 --> 00:20:37.254
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:40.257
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:20:40.382 --> 00:20:43.469
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:20:43.594 --> 00:20:46.555
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.933
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:20:49.058 --> 00:20:52.103
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

170
00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:54.605
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:57.066 --> 00:20:59.360
That's it.
The rebels are there.

172
00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:03.948
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:21:04.073 --> 00:21:06.826
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:21:06.951 --> 00:21:09.328
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:21:09.453 --> 00:21:12.456
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

176
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:15.000
General Veers,
prepare your men.

177
00:21:15.126 --> 00:21:16.460
Admiral.

178
00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:25.344
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.304
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.473
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:21:29.598 --> 00:21:31.267
Right, sir.

182
00:21:33.436 --> 00:21:35.479
All right. That's it.

183
00:21:35.604 --> 00:21:37.022
Try it.

184
00:21:38.816 --> 00:21:41.527
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:47.324
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

186
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.078
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:21:51.203 --> 00:21:53.247
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:56.667 --> 00:21:59.795
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:05.176
Okay, okay.

190
00:22:06.635 --> 00:22:08.095
Hi, kid.

191
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.307
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:12.850
Wait a second.

193
00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:16.353
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:22:22.568 --> 00:22:24.737
Be careful.

195
00:22:24.862 --> 00:22:26.697
You too.

196
00:22:32.828 --> 00:22:34.705
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.082
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

198
00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:40.169
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

199
00:22:40.294 --> 00:22:43.380
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:22:43.506 --> 00:22:45.549
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:59.438 --> 00:23:02.775
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.985
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

203
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:07.696
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:10.282
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:23:10.407 --> 00:23:12.868
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

206
00:23:12.993 --> 00:23:16.080
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:23:16.205 --> 00:23:18.457
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:23:18.582 --> 00:23:20.668
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:23:20.793 --> 00:23:24.380
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:26.132
Yes, my lord.

211
00:23:33.013 --> 00:23:34.223
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

212
00:23:34.348 --> 00:23:37.351
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,</i>
<i>and we're preparing to...</i>

213
00:23:38.436 --> 00:23:42.565
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.067
- Captain Piett.
- <i>Yes, my lord?</i>

215
00:23:45.192 --> 00:23:48.195
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.282
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:23:51.407 --> 00:23:54.577
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

218
00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:56.537
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

219
00:23:58.122 --> 00:24:01.208
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:04.003
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:24:04.128 --> 00:24:06.172
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:24:06.297 --> 00:24:09.383
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:12.011
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:14.221
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:24:14.346 --> 00:24:16.390
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

226
00:24:16.515 --> 00:24:19.643
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:21.854
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

228
00:24:21.979 --> 00:24:24.023
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

229
00:24:24.148 --> 00:24:26.066
Understood?

230
00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:27.777
Good luck.

231
00:24:27.902 --> 00:24:30.362
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

232
00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:50.591
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:24:50.716 --> 00:24:52.551
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.559
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

235
00:25:00.684 --> 00:25:02.770
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:25:04.814 --> 00:25:06.857
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:25:07.942 --> 00:25:08.943
Fire.

238
00:25:24.208 --> 00:25:27.253
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

239
00:25:27.378 --> 00:25:30.131
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

240
00:25:36.637 --> 00:25:38.514
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.516
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

242
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:43.561
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:25:43.686 --> 00:25:45.729
I know what you mean.

244
00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:07.376
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:26:07.501 --> 00:26:09.962
<i>Imperial walkers</i>
<i>on the north ridge.</i>

246
00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:34.361
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

247
00:26:39.784 --> 00:26:41.786
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

248
00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:44.038
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

249
00:26:44.163 --> 00:26:45.623
Steady, Dak.

250
00:26:45.748 --> 00:26:47.583
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

251
00:26:51.378 --> 00:26:53.005
I'm coming in.

252
00:26:57.551 --> 00:26:58.594
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:27:21.325 --> 00:27:23.452
That armour's too strong for blasters.

254
00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:28.082
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:27:28.207 --> 00:27:30.376
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

256
00:27:32.753 --> 00:27:34.004
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.924
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:27:37.049 --> 00:27:39.051
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:27:39.176 --> 00:27:41.053
Just hang on.

260
00:27:41.178 --> 00:27:43.973
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:27:49.395 --> 00:27:50.354
Dak?

262
00:28:14.503 --> 00:28:17.423
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:28:17.548 --> 00:28:20.634
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:28:25.639 --> 00:28:26.807
Rogue Three.

265
00:28:26.932 --> 00:28:28.350
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:28:28.476 --> 00:28:31.437
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.</i>
<i>You'll have to make this shot.</i>

267
00:28:31.562 --> 00:28:33.272
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

268
00:28:33.397 --> 00:28:35.733
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:38.903
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:43.240
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:28:44.241 --> 00:28:45.284
Activate harpoon.

272
00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:49.789
Good shot, Janson.

273
00:28:55.836 --> 00:28:58.130
One more pass.

274
00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:05.971
Cable out.
Let her go!

275
00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:07.306
Detach cable.

276
00:29:08.057 --> 00:29:09.183
Cable detached.

277
00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:18.692
Come on!

278
00:29:26.534 --> 00:29:29.120
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:29:29.662 --> 00:29:31.705
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:34.125
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

281
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.876
We have no choice.

282
00:29:36.836 --> 00:29:39.505
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:29:44.385 --> 00:29:47.930
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:51.517
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:55.479
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:29:59.191 --> 00:30:00.693
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:27.044
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

288
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:29.630
Prepare to target
the main generator.

289
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.762
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:30:36.887 --> 00:30:38.722
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

291
00:30:40.307 --> 00:30:43.227
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

292
00:30:44.687 --> 00:30:46.480
Set for position three.

293
00:30:46.605 --> 00:30:47.898
Steady.

294
00:30:48.023 --> 00:30:50.526
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

295
00:30:56.407 --> 00:30:57.658
Hobbie!

296
00:30:57.783 --> 00:30:59.243
I've been hit!

297
00:31:41.994 --> 00:31:44.663
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:31:44.788 --> 00:31:47.791
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:51.337
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:54.548
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:31:54.673 --> 00:31:57.760
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:31:59.428 --> 00:32:01.472
<i>Imperial troops</i>
<i>have entered the base.</i>

303
00:32:01.597 --> 00:32:03.223
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

304
00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:05.225
Come on. That's it.

305
00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:07.686
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:32:09.605 --> 00:32:11.649
And get to your transports.

307
00:32:11.774 --> 00:32:12.900
Wait for me.

308
00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:14.485
Begin retreat!

309
00:32:15.569 --> 00:32:17.404
Fall back!

310
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.424
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:33:27.558 --> 00:33:29.476
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:58.422
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:33:58.547 --> 00:34:00.466
I'll get her out on the <i>Falcon.</i>
Come on.

314
00:34:03.093 --> 00:34:05.137
Where are you going?
Come back!

315
00:34:23.656 --> 00:34:27.034
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.994
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:34:32.915 --> 00:34:35.834
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.711
Wait! Wait!

319
00:34:55.646 --> 00:34:58.816
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:01.151
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:35:02.444 --> 00:35:05.114
Sir, might I suggest that you...

322
00:35:05.239 --> 00:35:06.907
It can wait.

323
00:35:11.161 --> 00:35:13.664
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:35:13.789 --> 00:35:15.833
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

325
00:35:25.009 --> 00:35:26.802
Come on! Come on!

326
00:35:26.927 --> 00:35:29.888
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:32.891
See?

328
00:35:32.933 --> 00:35:35.019
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:35:37.896 --> 00:35:39.023
Punch it!

330
00:35:57.124 --> 00:35:58.125
R2.

331
00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:01.837
Get her ready for take-off.

332
00:36:04.131 --> 00:36:06.300
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:36:09.762 --> 00:36:12.222
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

334
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.946
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:36:31.408 --> 00:36:35.579
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:36:37.957 --> 00:36:39.416
Yes, R2.

337
00:36:42.336 --> 00:36:45.297
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:37:02.022 --> 00:37:04.400
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:06.694
Stardestroyers,
two of'em coming right at us.

340
00:37:06.819 --> 00:37:09.613
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:37:11.407 --> 00:37:13.450
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:17.538
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.

343
00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:23.836
Take evasive action!

344
00:37:35.389 --> 00:37:38.183
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

345
00:37:39.184 --> 00:37:40.894
They're getting closer.

346
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.147
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

347
00:37:46.275 --> 00:37:47.901
Watch what?

348
00:37:49.486 --> 00:37:51.947
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

349
00:37:52.072 --> 00:37:54.533
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

350
00:37:54.658 --> 00:37:57.745
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

351
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:03.292
Horizontal boosters!

352
00:38:05.502 --> 00:38:07.504
Alluvial dampers.

353
00:38:10.341 --> 00:38:13.010
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

354
00:38:16.513 --> 00:38:19.183
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

355
00:38:21.894 --> 00:38:23.103
Chewie!

356
00:38:26.774 --> 00:38:28.817
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

357
00:38:28.942 --> 00:38:30.361
Han, get up here.

358
00:38:32.112 --> 00:38:33.530
Come on, Chewie!

359
00:38:34.365 --> 00:38:35.366
Asteroids.

360
00:38:39.328 --> 00:38:41.914
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

361
00:38:43.415 --> 00:38:45.626
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

362
00:38:45.751 --> 00:38:47.503
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

363
00:38:50.714 --> 00:38:52.633
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

364
00:38:52.758 --> 00:38:55.928
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

365
00:38:56.053 --> 00:38:59.306
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

366
00:39:27.293 --> 00:39:30.421
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

367
00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:32.172
I take it back.

368
00:39:32.298 --> 00:39:35.384
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

369
00:39:35.509 --> 00:39:37.303
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

370
00:39:37.428 --> 00:39:39.263
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

371
00:39:39.388 --> 00:39:41.223
- Closer?
- Closer?

372
00:40:08.334 --> 00:40:10.210
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

373
00:40:10.336 --> 00:40:12.296
There. That looks pretty good.

374
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:14.298
What looks pretty good?

375
00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:16.800
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

376
00:40:16.925 --> 00:40:19.762
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

377
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.940
I hope you know
what you're doing.

378
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:33.484
Yeah. Me too.

379
00:40:42.284 --> 00:40:44.536
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

380
00:40:46.997 --> 00:40:49.208
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

381
00:40:50.167 --> 00:40:52.628
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

382
00:40:52.753 --> 00:40:54.797
Massive life form readings though.

383
00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:57.925
There's something alive down there.

384
00:40:59.593 --> 00:41:02.471
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

385
00:41:10.187 --> 00:41:11.897
I know! I know!

386
00:41:12.022 --> 00:41:14.692
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

387
00:41:14.817 --> 00:41:17.861
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

388
00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:14.627
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

389
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:20.341
R2?

390
00:42:24.303 --> 00:42:25.429
Where are you?

391
00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:30.392
R2!

392
00:42:37.274 --> 00:42:38.817
You be more careful.

393
00:42:41.862 --> 00:42:44.657
R2, that way.

394
00:43:12.726 --> 00:43:14.061
R2!

395
00:43:41.714 --> 00:43:43.215
Oh, no.

396
00:43:44.466 --> 00:43:46.510
Are you all right?
Come on.

397
00:43:50.055 --> 00:43:52.099
You were lucky
to get out of there.

398
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.144
Anything broken?

399
00:43:57.896 --> 00:44:00.983
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

400
00:44:01.108 --> 00:44:03.277
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

401
00:44:03.402 --> 00:44:06.071
R2, what are we doing here?

402
00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:07.614
It's like...

403
00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:10.743
something out of a dream or...

404
00:44:11.702 --> 00:44:13.746
I don't know.

405
00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:15.914
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

406
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.657
Yes, Admiral?

407
00:44:49.782 --> 00:44:51.867
Our ships have sighted
the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord...

408
00:44:51.992 --> 00:44:55.079
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

409
00:44:55.204 --> 00:44:57.998
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

410
00:44:58.123 --> 00:45:01.669
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

411
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.886
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

412
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:14.974
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

413
00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:17.142
No. I need you
to talk to the <i>Falcon...</i>

414
00:45:17.267 --> 00:45:19.520
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

415
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:30.864
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

416
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.866
Not entirely stable?

417
00:45:32.992 --> 00:45:35.035
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

418
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.747
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

419
00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:41.375
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

420
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.836
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

421
00:45:48.924 --> 00:45:50.342
Let go.

422
00:45:52.177 --> 00:45:54.471
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

423
00:45:54.596 --> 00:45:58.309
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

424
00:45:58.434 --> 00:46:00.269
Sorry, sweetheart.

425
00:46:00.394 --> 00:46:03.063
I haven't got time
for anything else.

426
00:46:37.514 --> 00:46:40.934
Ready for some power?
Okay.

427
00:46:44.938 --> 00:46:46.357
Let's see now.

428
00:46:46.482 --> 00:46:48.776
Put that in there.
There you go.

429
00:46:51.904 --> 00:46:54.657
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

430
00:46:54.782 --> 00:46:57.076
if he even exists.

431
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:05.501
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

432
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:08.796
This place gives me the creeps.

433
00:47:12.716 --> 00:47:14.134
Still...

434
00:47:15.427 --> 00:47:17.429
there's something familiar
about this place.

435
00:47:19.682 --> 00:47:21.475
I don't know.

436
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.644
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

437
00:47:24.728 --> 00:47:26.355
Like we're being watched.

438
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.483
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

439
00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:33.404
I am wondering,
why are you here?

440
00:47:35.114 --> 00:47:38.117
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

441
00:47:38.242 --> 00:47:40.869
Found someone you have,
I would say.

442
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:43.622
Right.

443
00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:46.959
Help you I can. Yes.

444
00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:49.044
I don't think so.

445
00:47:50.671 --> 00:47:53.382
I'm looking for a great warrior.

446
00:47:53.507 --> 00:47:55.134
Great warrior.

447
00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.472
Wars not make one great.

448
00:48:08.856 --> 00:48:10.566
Put that down.

449
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:12.609
Hey! That's my dinner.

450
00:48:15.946 --> 00:48:18.657
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

451
00:48:18.782 --> 00:48:20.993
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

452
00:48:21.118 --> 00:48:23.662
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

453
00:48:23.787 --> 00:48:25.873
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

454
00:48:25.998 --> 00:48:27.666
Get out of there.

455
00:48:30.919 --> 00:48:33.213
Hey, you could have broken this.

456
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.884
Don't do that.

457
00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:48.020
You're making a mess.

458
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:51.565
Hey, give me that.

459
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:54.234
Mine, or I will help you not.

460
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.362
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

461
00:48:56.487 --> 00:48:59.239
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

462
00:48:59.365 --> 00:49:01.492
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

463
00:49:05.371 --> 00:49:06.789
R2, let him have it.

464
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:12.211
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

465
00:49:16.131 --> 00:49:19.510
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

466
00:49:20.594 --> 00:49:23.806
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

467
00:49:24.682 --> 00:49:27.559
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

468
00:49:29.687 --> 00:49:32.064
Jedi master. Yoda.

469
00:49:32.189 --> 00:49:34.775
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

470
00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:38.612
Take you to him I will.

471
00:49:39.863 --> 00:49:42.992
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

472
00:49:43.117 --> 00:49:45.786
Come.
Good food. Come.

473
00:49:55.587 --> 00:49:57.214
Come, come.

474
00:49:59.425 --> 00:50:00.509
R2...

475
00:50:01.385 --> 00:50:03.637
stay and watch after the camp.

476
00:50:17.192 --> 00:50:19.236
Where is R2 when I need him?

477
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:22.031
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

478
00:50:22.156 --> 00:50:24.074
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

479
00:50:24.199 --> 00:50:27.703
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

480
00:50:27.828 --> 00:50:30.289
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

481
00:50:31.373 --> 00:50:33.626
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

482
00:50:34.877 --> 00:50:37.087
Here. And, Chewie...

483
00:50:38.756 --> 00:50:41.425
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

484
00:51:03.822 --> 00:51:06.492
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

485
00:51:06.617 --> 00:51:09.078
Would you please
stop calling me that?

486
00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:11.163
Sure, Leia.

487
00:51:11.288 --> 00:51:14.708
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

488
00:51:15.793 --> 00:51:18.045
You could be a little nicer though.

489
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.839
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

490
00:51:23.217 --> 00:51:25.469
Occasionally, maybe...

491
00:51:25.594 --> 00:51:28.055
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

492
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.598
Scoundrel?

493
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.270
I like the sound of that.

494
00:51:36.355 --> 00:51:39.149
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

495
00:51:39.274 --> 00:51:41.443
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

496
00:51:41.568 --> 00:51:43.737
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

497
00:51:43.862 --> 00:51:45.990
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

498
00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:49.034
I'm not trembling.

499
00:51:50.494 --> 00:51:52.955
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

500
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.499
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

501
00:51:55.624 --> 00:51:57.668
I happen to like nice men.

502
00:51:57.793 --> 00:52:00.462
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

503
00:52:03.382 --> 00:52:04.383
Sir, sir!

504
00:52:04.508 --> 00:52:07.386
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

505
00:52:09.638 --> 00:52:10.848
Thank you.

506
00:52:10.973 --> 00:52:13.934
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

507
00:52:20.024 --> 00:52:23.152
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time</i>
<i>they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

508
00:52:23.277 --> 00:52:26.196
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,</i>
<i>they must have been destroyed.</i>

509
00:52:26.322 --> 00:52:29.617
No, Captain, they're alive.

510
00:52:29.742 --> 00:52:34.079
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

511
00:52:38.626 --> 00:52:41.920
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

512
00:52:42.046 --> 00:52:44.298
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

513
00:52:44.423 --> 00:52:46.592
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

514
00:52:46.717 --> 00:52:48.969
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

515
00:52:49.094 --> 00:52:50.721
Yes, my lord.

516
00:53:07.321 --> 00:53:09.865
What is thy bidding, my master?

517
00:53:11.158 --> 00:53:15.204
<i>There is a great disturbance</i>
<i>in the Force.</i>

518
00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.415
I have felt it.

519
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.085
<i>We have a new enemy...</i>

520
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:25.214
<i>the young rebel who destroyed</i>
<i>the Death Star.</i>

521
00:53:25.339 --> 00:53:28.467
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

522
00:53:28.592 --> 00:53:32.972
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

523
00:53:33.097 --> 00:53:35.349
How is that possible?

524
00:53:35.474 --> 00:53:38.852
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

525
00:53:38.978 --> 00:53:42.189
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

526
00:53:42.314 --> 00:53:44.775
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

527
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.986
He's just a boy.

528
00:53:47.111 --> 00:53:49.571
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

529
00:53:49.697 --> 00:53:53.284
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

530
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.581
<i>The son of Skywalker</i>
<i>must not become a Jedi.</i>

531
00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:01.875
If he could be turned...

532
00:54:02.001 --> 00:54:04.837
he would become a powerful ally.

533
00:54:05.879 --> 00:54:07.589
<i>Yes.</i>

534
00:54:08.465 --> 00:54:12.720
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

535
00:54:12.845 --> 00:54:15.097
<i>Can it be done?</i>

536
00:54:15.222 --> 00:54:19.184
He will join us or die, master.

537
00:54:35.826 --> 00:54:39.747
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

538
00:54:39.872 --> 00:54:43.667
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

539
00:54:47.087 --> 00:54:49.048
Eat. Eat.

540
00:54:49.923 --> 00:54:51.258
Hot.

541
00:54:59.016 --> 00:55:00.976
Good food. Good.

542
00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:04.021
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

543
00:55:04.146 --> 00:55:06.398
Not far. Yoda not far.

544
00:55:06.523 --> 00:55:09.276
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

545
00:55:11.695 --> 00:55:14.365
Root leaf. I cook.

546
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.661
Why wish you become Jedi?

547
00:55:19.745 --> 00:55:22.414
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

548
00:55:22.539 --> 00:55:25.626
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

549
00:55:27.127 --> 00:55:28.879
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

550
00:55:29.755 --> 00:55:32.508
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

551
00:55:32.633 --> 00:55:36.136
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

552
00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:39.848
I cannot teach him.

553
00:55:39.974 --> 00:55:42.017
The boy has no patience.

554
00:55:42.142 --> 00:55:44.395
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

555
00:55:49.233 --> 00:55:51.610
Much anger in him...

556
00:55:51.735 --> 00:55:53.570
like his father.

557
00:55:53.696 --> 00:55:57.408
<i>Was I any different</i>
<i>when you taught me?</i>

558
00:55:58.784 --> 00:55:59.743
No.

559
00:56:00.703 --> 00:56:03.914
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

560
00:56:07.042 --> 00:56:08.877
I am ready.

561
00:56:09.003 --> 00:56:11.922
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

562
00:56:12.047 --> 00:56:15.884
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

563
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.972
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

564
00:56:20.097 --> 00:56:23.851
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

565
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:29.606
AJedi must have
the deepest commitment...

566
00:56:29.732 --> 00:56:31.567
the most serious mind.

567
00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:36.655
This one a long time have I watched.

568
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.492
All his life
has he looked away...

569
00:56:40.618 --> 00:56:43.662
to the future,
to the horizon.

570
00:56:43.787 --> 00:56:47.333
Never his mind on where he was...

571
00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:50.711
what he was doing.

572
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:53.422
Adventure.

573
00:56:54.798 --> 00:56:56.425
Excitement.

574
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:58.802
AJedi craves not these things.

575
00:56:59.762 --> 00:57:01.555
You are reckless.

576
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.642
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

577
00:57:04.767 --> 00:57:06.810
He is too old.

578
00:57:08.812 --> 00:57:10.981
Yes, too old to begin the training.

579
00:57:11.106 --> 00:57:13.025
But I've learned so much.

580
00:57:20.866 --> 00:57:24.119
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

581
00:57:25.663 --> 00:57:27.331
I'm not afraid.

582
00:57:31.835 --> 00:57:33.879
You will be.

583
00:57:35.047 --> 00:57:37.091
You will be.

584
00:58:19.049 --> 00:58:22.553
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

585
00:58:22.678 --> 00:58:24.680
There's something out there.

586
00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:26.765
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

587
00:58:28.475 --> 00:58:29.977
There it is. Listen!

588
00:58:30.102 --> 00:58:31.979
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:58:32.104 --> 00:58:34.648
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

590
00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:36.900
Then I'm going with you.

591
00:58:38.152 --> 00:58:41.238
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

592
00:58:41.363 --> 00:58:42.364
Oh, no.

593
00:58:57.463 --> 00:58:59.506
This ground sure feels strange.

594
00:59:01.133 --> 00:59:03.177
It doesn't feel like rock.

595
00:59:07.681 --> 00:59:10.267
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

596
00:59:10.392 --> 00:59:14.104
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

597
00:59:14.229 --> 00:59:15.439
Yeah.

598
00:59:17.524 --> 00:59:18.442
Watch out!

599
00:59:19.568 --> 00:59:22.029
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:59:22.154 --> 00:59:24.615
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

601
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.868
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

602
00:59:27.993 --> 00:59:29.870
chewing on the power cables.

603
00:59:29.995 --> 00:59:31.580
Mynocks?

604
00:59:31.705 --> 00:59:33.916
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

605
00:59:43.092 --> 00:59:45.552
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

606
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:54.687
Wait a minute.

607
01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:19.837
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

608
01:00:19.962 --> 01:00:22.006
No time to discuss this
in committee!

609
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:24.925
I am not a committee!

610
01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:33.225
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

611
01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.811
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

612
01:00:40.607 --> 01:00:41.942
- Look!
- I see it.

613
01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:44.445
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

614
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.447
- This is no cave.
- What?

615
01:01:18.937 --> 01:01:20.314
Yes, run.

616
01:01:20.439 --> 01:01:21.982
Yes.

617
01:01:22.107 --> 01:01:25.444
AJedi's strength
flows from the Force.

618
01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:28.989
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

619
01:01:29.114 --> 01:01:31.283
The dark side
of the Force are they.

620
01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:34.995
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

621
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.331
If once you start down
the dark path...

622
01:01:37.456 --> 01:01:39.750
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

623
01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:43.837
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

624
01:01:43.963 --> 01:01:45.798
Vader.

625
01:01:45.923 --> 01:01:49.009
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

626
01:01:50.761 --> 01:01:52.721
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

627
01:01:53.597 --> 01:01:55.683
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

628
01:01:55.808 --> 01:01:58.060
You will know...

629
01:01:58.185 --> 01:02:00.437
when you are calm,
at peace...

630
01:02:01.522 --> 01:02:02.940
passive.

631
01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:08.195
AJedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

632
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.155
never for attack.

633
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:13.909
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

634
01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.787
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

635
01:02:16.912 --> 01:02:18.872
Clear your mind of questions.

636
01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:43.939
There's something not right here.

637
01:02:47.818 --> 01:02:49.236
I feel cold.

638
01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:51.655
- Death.
- That place...

639
01:02:52.781 --> 01:02:56.285
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

640
01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:58.329
A domain of evil it is.

641
01:02:59.788 --> 01:03:01.707
In you must go.

642
01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:04.126
What's in there?

643
01:03:06.879 --> 01:03:09.173
Only what you take with you.

644
01:03:12.968 --> 01:03:14.178
Your weapons...

645
01:03:15.054 --> 01:03:16.513
you will not need them.

646
01:05:56.757 --> 01:05:59.218
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

647
01:05:59.343 --> 01:06:02.096
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

648
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:11.105
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer <i>Avenger.</i>

649
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.773
Right.

650
01:06:12.898 --> 01:06:18.696
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

651
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:21.865
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

652
01:06:21.991 --> 01:06:24.118
but I want them alive.

653
01:06:24.243 --> 01:06:26.662
No disintegrations.

654
01:06:26.787 --> 01:06:28.622
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

655
01:06:30.716 --> 01:06:32.635
My lord, we have them.

656
01:06:37.098 --> 01:06:40.184
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

657
01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:48.025
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

658
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.361
One, two...

659
01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:51.612
three!

660
01:06:58.244 --> 01:07:00.496
It's not fair.

661
01:07:02.081 --> 01:07:04.875
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

662
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.920
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

663
01:07:12.716 --> 01:07:14.718
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

664
01:07:14.844 --> 01:07:17.096
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

665
01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:18.931
Turn her around.

666
01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:21.684
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

667
01:07:21.809 --> 01:07:23.811
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

668
01:07:23.936 --> 01:07:25.855
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

669
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.898
Shut up!

670
01:07:34.405 --> 01:07:36.365
They're moving to attack position.

671
01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:39.660
Shields up.

672
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:48.836
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

673
01:07:48.961 --> 01:07:51.338
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

674
01:07:51.464 --> 01:07:55.092
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

675
01:07:55.217 --> 01:07:59.054
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

676
01:08:02.057 --> 01:08:04.101
Get a shuttle ready.

677
01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:08.147
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

678
01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:11.358
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

679
01:08:16.072 --> 01:08:18.324
Use the Force.

680
01:08:18.449 --> 01:08:19.450
Yes.

681
01:08:25.081 --> 01:08:26.832
Now, the stone.

682
01:08:31.003 --> 01:08:32.630
Feel it.

683
01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:46.143
Concentrate!

684
01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:03.869
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

685
01:09:03.994 --> 01:09:05.704
So certain are you.

686
01:09:09.792 --> 01:09:13.003
Always with you
it cannot be done.

687
01:09:14.255 --> 01:09:16.215
Hear you nothing that I say?

688
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.426
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

689
01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:20.386
This is totally different.

690
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.763
No. No different.

691
01:09:22.888 --> 01:09:24.974
Only different in your mind.

692
01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:28.310
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

693
01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:32.773
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

694
01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:35.067
Do...

695
01:09:35.192 --> 01:09:36.777
or do not.

696
01:09:36.902 --> 01:09:38.571
There is no try.

697
01:10:27.203 --> 01:10:30.122
I can't. It's too big.

698
01:10:30.247 --> 01:10:32.291
Size matters not.

699
01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:35.419
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

700
01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:41.050
And well you should not...

701
01:10:41.175 --> 01:10:43.803
for my ally is the Force.

702
01:10:43.928 --> 01:10:46.305
And a powerful ally it is.

703
01:10:47.389 --> 01:10:49.767
Life creates it...

704
01:10:49.892 --> 01:10:51.936
makes it grow.

705
01:10:52.812 --> 01:10:55.606
Its energy surrounds us...

706
01:10:56.649 --> 01:10:58.442
and binds us.

707
01:10:58.567 --> 01:11:01.779
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

708
01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:06.117
You must feel
the Force around you.

709
01:11:06.992 --> 01:11:09.578
Here, between you, me...

710
01:11:10.454 --> 01:11:12.706
the tree, the rock...

711
01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:14.917
everywhere.

712
01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.460
Yes...

713
01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:20.381
even between
the land and the ship.

714
01:11:25.302 --> 01:11:27.555
You want the impossible.

715
01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:17.123
I don't believe it.

716
01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:21.794
That is why you fail.

717
01:13:41.063 --> 01:13:44.316
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

718
01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:55.770
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

719
01:13:55.895 --> 01:13:57.855
If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
went into light speed...

720
01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.899
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

721
01:14:00.024 --> 01:14:01.859
Alert all commands.

722
01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:06.238
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

723
01:14:06.364 --> 01:14:09.742
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

724
01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.703
Admiral.

725
01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:18.167
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

726
01:14:33.182 --> 01:14:36.352
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

727
01:14:36.477 --> 01:14:39.563
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

728
01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:41.732
The fleet's beginning to break up.

729
01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.735
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

730
01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:49.073
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

731
01:14:49.198 --> 01:14:52.660
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

732
01:14:52.785 --> 01:14:54.870
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

733
01:14:54.996 --> 01:14:57.415
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

734
01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.458
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

735
01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:01.836
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

736
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:04.964
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

737
01:15:05.089 --> 01:15:06.507
Then what?

738
01:15:06.632 --> 01:15:09.885
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

739
01:15:10.011 --> 01:15:11.387
Any ideas?

740
01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.889
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

741
01:15:14.015 --> 01:15:16.600
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

742
01:15:16.726 --> 01:15:19.562
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

743
01:15:19.687 --> 01:15:22.565
- Lando.
- Lando system?

744
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:26.277
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

745
01:15:26.402 --> 01:15:28.654
Card player, gambler.

746
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:31.365
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

747
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.160
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

748
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:38.706
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

749
01:15:39.582 --> 01:15:41.709
Lando conned somebody out of it.

750
01:15:41.834 --> 01:15:44.545
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

751
01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:48.632
- Can you trust him?
- No.

752
01:15:48.758 --> 01:15:51.636
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

753
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.348
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

754
01:16:02.563 --> 01:16:04.106
You do have your moments.

755
01:16:04.982 --> 01:16:07.818
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

756
01:16:42.603 --> 01:16:44.522
Concentrate.

757
01:16:44.647 --> 01:16:47.858
Feel the Force flow.

758
01:16:47.984 --> 01:16:49.610
Yes.

759
01:16:57.284 --> 01:16:58.953
Good.

760
01:16:59.078 --> 01:17:00.454
Calm.

761
01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:01.914
Yes.

762
01:17:02.873 --> 01:17:05.418
Through the Force,
things you will see.

763
01:17:05.543 --> 01:17:09.005
Other places.
The future. The past.

764
01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:11.549
Old friends long gone.

765
01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.519
Control, control.

766
01:17:23.644 --> 01:17:25.855
You must learn control.

767
01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:31.819
I saw a city in the clouds.

768
01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.073
Friends you have there.

769
01:17:37.158 --> 01:17:40.786
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

770
01:17:41.996 --> 01:17:42.997
Future?

771
01:17:52.006 --> 01:17:53.424
Will they die?

772
01:17:56.677 --> 01:17:58.763
Difficult to see.

773
01:17:58.888 --> 01:18:01.349
Always in motion is the future.

774
01:18:03.851 --> 01:18:05.269
I've gotta go to them.

775
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:10.316
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

776
01:18:10.441 --> 01:18:13.319
If you leave now,
help them you could...

777
01:18:14.403 --> 01:18:17.948
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

778
01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:34.799
No, I don't have a landing permit.

779
01:18:34.924 --> 01:18:38.552
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

780
01:18:38.678 --> 01:18:40.805
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

781
01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:42.890
<i>You will not deviate</i>
<i>from your present course.</i>

782
01:18:43.015 --> 01:18:45.726
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

783
01:18:48.646 --> 01:18:51.440
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

784
01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:03.661
<i>Permission granted to land</i>
<i>on Platform 327.</i>

785
01:19:03.786 --> 01:19:05.162
Thank you.

786
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.958
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

787
01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:10.751
Who's worried?

788
01:19:59.592 --> 01:20:01.010
No one to meet us.

789
01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:04.764
I don't like this.

790
01:20:04.889 --> 01:20:07.725
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

791
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:10.561
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

792
01:20:10.686 --> 01:20:12.313
Trust me.

793
01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:19.111
See? My friend.

794
01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:25.576
Keep your eyes open.

795
01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:29.914
Hey.

796
01:20:30.039 --> 01:20:34.126
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

797
01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:38.464
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

798
01:20:48.975 --> 01:20:52.436
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

799
01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:55.606
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

800
01:20:55.731 --> 01:20:58.818
Yes. Very friendly.

801
01:20:58.943 --> 01:21:00.569
What are you doing here?

802
01:21:00.695 --> 01:21:02.697
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

803
01:21:02.822 --> 01:21:05.449
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

804
01:21:05.574 --> 01:21:09.120
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

805
01:21:09.996 --> 01:21:11.372
How you doin', Chewbacca?

806
01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:15.001
Still hanging around with this loser?

807
01:21:17.003 --> 01:21:19.338
Hello.
What have we here?

808
01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.385
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

809
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:27.430
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

810
01:21:27.555 --> 01:21:29.181
Welcome, Leia.

811
01:21:32.018 --> 01:21:34.854
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

812
01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:38.607
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

813
01:21:38.733 --> 01:21:41.527
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

814
01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:44.030
- What's wrong with the <i>Falcon</i>?
- Hyperdrive.

815
01:21:44.155 --> 01:21:46.198
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

816
01:21:46.324 --> 01:21:48.367
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

817
01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:51.037
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

818
01:21:52.371 --> 01:21:54.832
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

819
01:21:54.957 --> 01:21:58.794
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

820
01:21:58.919 --> 01:22:02.006
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

821
01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:04.300
I've had labour difficulties.

822
01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:07.678
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

823
01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:10.598
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

824
01:22:10.723 --> 01:22:12.600
Who'd have thought that, huh?

825
01:22:12.725 --> 01:22:15.645
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

826
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:16.979
Yeah.

827
01:22:17.104 --> 01:22:19.231
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

828
01:22:20.107 --> 01:22:22.777
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

829
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:28.074
Nice to see a familiar face.

830
01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:29.825
How rude!

831
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:33.454
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

832
01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.164
I wonder if... Hello?

833
01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:38.959
How interesting.

834
01:22:39.085 --> 01:22:42.171
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

835
01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:44.340
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

836
01:23:02.817 --> 01:23:05.403
Luke, you must complete the training.

837
01:23:06.487 --> 01:23:09.281
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

838
01:23:09.407 --> 01:23:11.534
You must not go.

839
01:23:11.659 --> 01:23:14.745
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- <i>You don't know that.</i>

840
01:23:17.748 --> 01:23:20.418
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

841
01:23:20.543 --> 01:23:23.295
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

842
01:23:23.421 --> 01:23:25.589
But you cannot control it.

843
01:23:25.798 --> 01:23:28.134
This is a dangerous time for you...

844
01:23:28.259 --> 01:23:31.262
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

845
01:23:31.387 --> 01:23:34.598
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

846
01:23:35.474 --> 01:23:36.892
The cave.

847
01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:39.103
Remember your failure at the cave.

848
01:23:39.228 --> 01:23:41.147
But I've learned
so much since then.

849
01:23:41.272 --> 01:23:43.941
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

850
01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.027
You have my word.

851
01:23:46.152 --> 01:23:48.946
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

852
01:23:49.071 --> 01:23:51.782
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

853
01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:55.911
That's why I have to go.

854
01:23:56.037 --> 01:24:00.374
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

855
01:24:00.499 --> 01:24:02.001
You won't.

856
01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.464
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

857
01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:10.801
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

858
01:24:10.926 --> 01:24:13.512
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

859
01:24:13.638 --> 01:24:15.723
If you end your training now...

860
01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:20.144
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

861
01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:22.897
you will become an agent of evil.

862
01:24:23.022 --> 01:24:23.981
Patience.

863
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:29.320
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

864
01:24:29.445 --> 01:24:30.446
yes.

865
01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:33.658
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

866
01:24:33.783 --> 01:24:35.785
I cannot interfere.

867
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:39.080
I understand.

868
01:24:44.585 --> 01:24:47.380
R2, fire up the converters.

869
01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.720
Don't give in to hate.

870
01:24:54.845 --> 01:24:57.598
That leads to the dark side.

871
01:24:57.723 --> 01:24:59.433
Strong is Vader.

872
01:24:59.558 --> 01:25:02.061
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

873
01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.522
I will.

874
01:25:04.647 --> 01:25:07.108
And I'll return. I promise.

875
01:25:14.198 --> 01:25:17.243
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

876
01:25:17.368 --> 01:25:18.953
Now...

877
01:25:19.078 --> 01:25:20.830
matters are worse.

878
01:25:20.955 --> 01:25:22.999
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

879
01:25:23.124 --> 01:25:26.043
No, there is another.

880
01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.495
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

881
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.664
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

882
01:26:03.789 --> 01:26:05.833
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

883
01:26:05.958 --> 01:26:08.169
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

884
01:26:08.294 --> 01:26:10.004
Relax.

885
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:13.007
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

886
01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:15.593
I don't trust Lando.

887
01:26:15.718 --> 01:26:19.055
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

888
01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.849
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

889
01:26:23.309 --> 01:26:25.353
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

890
01:27:00.388 --> 01:27:01.889
What happened?

891
01:27:02.974 --> 01:27:03.975
Where?

892
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.812
Found him in a junk pile?

893
01:27:07.937 --> 01:27:10.481
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

894
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:16.153
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

895
01:27:17.738 --> 01:27:19.573
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

896
01:27:20.533 --> 01:27:21.659
Not really.

897
01:27:25.204 --> 01:27:27.206
You look absolutely beautiful.

898
01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:30.626
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

899
01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:32.211
Thank you.

900
01:27:32.336 --> 01:27:35.256
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

901
01:27:35.381 --> 01:27:38.175
Everyone's invited, of course.

902
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:40.386
Having trouble with your droid?

903
01:27:40.511 --> 01:27:43.139
No. No problem. Why?

904
01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:54.483
You see, since we're
a small operation...

905
01:27:54.608 --> 01:27:57.862
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

906
01:27:57.987 --> 01:28:00.531
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

907
01:28:00.656 --> 01:28:02.825
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

908
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:04.994
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

909
01:28:05.119 --> 01:28:09.540
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

910
01:28:09.665 --> 01:28:13.544
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

911
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:16.964
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

912
01:28:17.089 --> 01:28:19.800
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

913
01:28:19.925 --> 01:28:23.220
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

914
01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:35.733
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

915
01:28:42.615 --> 01:28:44.992
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

916
01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:47.620
I'm sorry.

917
01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:52.458
I'm sorry too.

918
01:29:07.306 --> 01:29:08.683
No, 3PO's with them.

919
01:29:10.101 --> 01:29:12.186
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

920
01:30:11.746 --> 01:30:14.206
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

921
01:30:14.332 --> 01:30:16.292
No, please don't get up.

922
01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:25.509
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

923
01:30:25.635 --> 01:30:28.220
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

924
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.667
Lord Vader.

925
01:30:57.792 --> 01:31:00.169
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

926
01:31:00.294 --> 01:31:02.296
after I have Skywalker.

927
01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:04.298
He's no good to me dead.

928
01:31:04.423 --> 01:31:07.718
He will not be
permanently damaged.

929
01:31:10.137 --> 01:31:12.682
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

930
01:31:12.807 --> 01:31:15.518
They must never again leave this city.

931
01:31:15.643 --> 01:31:18.854
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

932
01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:22.900
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

933
01:31:25.653 --> 01:31:26.654
No.

934
01:31:26.779 --> 01:31:30.324
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

935
01:31:32.743 --> 01:31:35.121
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

936
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.708
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

937
01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:42.878
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

938
01:31:45.423 --> 01:31:47.633
That's much better.

939
01:31:47.758 --> 01:31:49.385
Wait. Wait.

940
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:51.554
Oh, my!
What have you done?

941
01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:53.222
I'm backwards!

942
01:31:53.347 --> 01:31:55.224
You flea-bitten furball!

943
01:31:55.349 --> 01:31:58.019
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

944
01:32:12.616 --> 01:32:14.577
I feel terrible.

945
01:32:29.842 --> 01:32:31.886
Why are they doing this?

946
01:32:34.388 --> 01:32:37.058
They never even asked me
any questions.

947
01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.569
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

948
01:32:48.694 --> 01:32:51.781
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

949
01:32:51.906 --> 01:32:53.783
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

950
01:32:53.908 --> 01:32:56.035
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

951
01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.579
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

952
01:32:58.704 --> 01:33:02.083
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

953
01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.752
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

954
01:33:04.877 --> 01:33:06.712
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

955
01:33:07.672 --> 01:33:09.882
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

956
01:33:10.007 --> 01:33:11.175
My friend.

957
01:33:14.178 --> 01:33:15.388
Stop!

958
01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:18.849
I've done all I can.

959
01:33:18.975 --> 01:33:21.394
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

960
01:33:21.519 --> 01:33:22.812
Yeah.

961
01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:24.772
You're a real hero.

962
01:33:35.574 --> 01:33:38.035
You certainly
have a way with people.

963
01:33:52.425 --> 01:33:54.260
This facility is crude...

964
01:33:54.385 --> 01:33:57.471
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

965
01:33:57.596 --> 01:33:59.849
for his journey to the emperor.

966
01:33:59.974 --> 01:34:02.977
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

967
01:34:03.102 --> 01:34:06.480
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

968
01:34:08.024 --> 01:34:12.737
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

969
01:34:12.862 --> 01:34:15.740
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

970
01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:18.951
We will test it on Captain Solo.

971
01:34:42.725 --> 01:34:46.937
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

972
01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:49.732
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

973
01:34:49.857 --> 01:34:51.567
so don't do anything foolish.

974
01:35:05.665 --> 01:35:07.708
What's going on, buddy?

975
01:35:08.668 --> 01:35:10.753
You're being put into carbon freeze.

976
01:35:10.878 --> 01:35:14.382
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

977
01:35:14.507 --> 01:35:17.885
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

978
01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:23.015
Chewbacca, stop!

979
01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.142
No, Chewie, stop!

980
01:35:25.267 --> 01:35:28.270
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

981
01:35:28.396 --> 01:35:30.356
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

982
01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:32.984
Chewie, this won't help me.

983
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:35.695
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

984
01:35:37.571 --> 01:35:39.198
The princess.

985
01:35:39.323 --> 01:35:41.075
You have to take care of her.

986
01:35:43.327 --> 01:35:45.329
Do you hear me?

987
01:35:59.218 --> 01:36:02.179
- I love you.
- I know.

988
01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:34.962
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

989
01:37:33.854 --> 01:37:35.898
They've encased him in carbonite.

990
01:37:36.023 --> 01:37:37.900
He should be quite
well-protected...

991
01:37:38.025 --> 01:37:39.944
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

992
01:37:40.069 --> 01:37:42.571
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

993
01:37:42.697 --> 01:37:44.323
Yes, he's alive.

994
01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:47.076
And in perfect hibernation.

995
01:37:48.035 --> 01:37:50.162
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

996
01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:52.748
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

997
01:37:55.167 --> 01:37:57.003
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

998
01:37:57.128 --> 01:38:01.007
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

999
01:38:05.261 --> 01:38:07.138
Calrissian...

1000
01:38:07.263 --> 01:38:09.682
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1001
01:38:09.807 --> 01:38:11.934
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

1002
01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:14.103
I am altering the deal.

1003
01:38:14.228 --> 01:38:16.939
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1004
01:39:54.203 --> 01:39:56.747
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1005
01:39:58.249 --> 01:39:59.333
It's a trap!

1006
01:40:45.755 --> 01:40:48.132
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1007
01:40:50.551 --> 01:40:52.595
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1008
01:41:54.615 --> 01:41:56.242
Well done.

1009
01:41:58.035 --> 01:42:00.830
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1010
01:42:00.955 --> 01:42:02.623
Move.

1011
01:42:07.086 --> 01:42:10.381
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1012
01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:12.258
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1013
01:42:12.383 --> 01:42:15.219
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1014
01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:19.515
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1015
01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.643
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1016
01:42:22.768 --> 01:42:24.312
I'm just trying to help.

1017
01:42:24.437 --> 01:42:27.064
We don't need any of your help.

1018
01:42:32.194 --> 01:42:33.696
What?

1019
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:38.409
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1020
01:42:39.368 --> 01:42:42.621
at the east... platform.

1021
01:42:46.834 --> 01:42:48.961
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1022
01:42:49.086 --> 01:42:50.838
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1023
01:42:51.797 --> 01:42:54.467
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1024
01:43:09.690 --> 01:43:11.942
R2, where have you been?

1025
01:43:12.068 --> 01:43:13.944
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1026
01:43:15.154 --> 01:43:17.907
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1027
01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.079
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1028
01:43:23.204 --> 01:43:25.539
Look what's happened to me.

1029
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:40.096
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1030
01:43:53.067 --> 01:43:55.403
You have learned much, young one.

1031
01:43:55.528 --> 01:43:57.655
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1032
01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:12.336
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1033
01:44:13.212 --> 01:44:15.673
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1034
01:44:23.764 --> 01:44:25.099
All too easy.

1035
01:44:30.354 --> 01:44:32.815
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1036
01:44:35.985 --> 01:44:37.611
Impressive.

1037
01:44:39.572 --> 01:44:40.990
Most impressive.

1038
01:44:48.873 --> 01:44:52.543
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1039
01:44:55.338 --> 01:44:58.549
Now, release your anger.

1040
01:44:58.674 --> 01:45:01.260
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1041
01:47:12.224 --> 01:47:14.143
The security code
has been changed.

1042
01:47:14.268 --> 01:47:17.563
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1043
01:47:18.522 --> 01:47:20.232
R2, hurry.

1044
01:47:23.527 --> 01:47:25.821
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1045
01:47:25.946 --> 01:47:27.907
<i>The Empire has taken control</i>
<i>of the city.</i>

1046
01:47:28.032 --> 01:47:30.868
<i>I advise everyone to leave</i>
<i>before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1047
01:47:37.375 --> 01:47:39.001
This way.

1048
01:47:39.126 --> 01:47:41.337
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1049
01:47:41.462 --> 01:47:44.340
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1050
01:48:05.945 --> 01:48:08.864
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the <i>Falcon.</i> It's fixed!

1051
01:48:13.869 --> 01:48:16.664
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1052
01:48:25.256 --> 01:48:27.675
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1053
01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:54.910
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1054
01:49:02.043 --> 01:49:03.419
Go!

1055
01:49:09.842 --> 01:49:12.637
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1056
01:49:12.762 --> 01:49:14.639
Of course I've looked better.

1057
01:50:08.317 --> 01:50:11.988
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1058
01:50:12.113 --> 01:50:15.616
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1059
01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.050
There is no escape.

1060
01:50:33.926 --> 01:50:36.053
Don't make me destroy you.

1061
01:50:40.057 --> 01:50:42.810
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1062
01:50:42.935 --> 01:50:45.604
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1063
01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:47.565
Join me...

1064
01:50:47.690 --> 01:50:50.067
and I will complete your training.

1065
01:50:50.192 --> 01:50:52.570
With our combined strength...

1066
01:50:52.695 --> 01:50:55.614
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1067
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:58.034
and bring order to the galaxy.

1068
01:50:58.159 --> 01:51:00.661
I'll never join you!

1069
01:51:00.786 --> 01:51:04.874
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1070
01:51:04.999 --> 01:51:09.211
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1071
01:51:09.337 --> 01:51:10.755
He told me enough.

1072
01:51:13.382 --> 01:51:15.217
He told me you killed him.

1073
01:51:17.011 --> 01:51:19.096
I am your father.

1074
01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:29.565
That's not true.

1075
01:51:30.441 --> 01:51:32.068
That's impossible!

1076
01:51:32.193 --> 01:51:35.446
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1077
01:51:44.288 --> 01:51:48.417
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1078
01:51:48.542 --> 01:51:51.420
It is your destiny.

1079
01:51:51.545 --> 01:51:53.255
Join me...

1080
01:51:53.381 --> 01:51:57.677
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1081
01:52:08.312 --> 01:52:09.939
Come with me.

1082
01:52:10.815 --> 01:52:12.984
It is the only way.

1083
01:53:19.258 --> 01:53:20.635
Ben.

1084
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:23.346
Ben, please.

1085
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:52.875
Hear me.

1086
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.884
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1087
01:54:02.009 --> 01:54:04.345
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1088
01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:07.723
Chewie, just do it.

1089
01:54:07.848 --> 01:54:09.558
All right, all right!

1090
01:54:17.775 --> 01:54:21.821
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1091
01:54:32.373 --> 01:54:34.417
Look, someone's up there.

1092
01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:38.129
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1093
01:54:38.254 --> 01:54:41.549
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1094
01:54:57.481 --> 01:54:59.817
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1095
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:23.716
- Lando?
- <i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1096
01:55:43.778 --> 01:55:45.196
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1097
01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:22.608
I'll be back.

1098
01:56:28.364 --> 01:56:29.740
Stardestroyer.

1099
01:56:34.996 --> 01:56:37.456
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1100
01:56:37.581 --> 01:56:39.625
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1101
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:42.086
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1102
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:43.671
Punch it!

1103
01:56:54.348 --> 01:56:56.642
They told me they fixed it.

1104
01:56:56.767 --> 01:56:58.644
I trusted them!

1105
01:56:58.769 --> 01:57:01.272
It's not my fault!

1106
01:57:06.902 --> 01:57:09.530
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1107
01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:13.200
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

1108
01:57:13.326 --> 01:57:15.328
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1109
01:57:15.453 --> 01:57:19.081
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1110
01:57:19.206 --> 01:57:22.209
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:57:23.794 --> 01:57:27.089
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1112
01:57:27.214 --> 01:57:28.799
We can't?

1113
01:57:28.924 --> 01:57:31.302
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1114
01:57:34.597 --> 01:57:37.475
The city's central computer told you?

1115
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.353
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1116
01:57:40.478 --> 01:57:43.773
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1117
01:57:56.077 --> 01:57:57.244
Father.

1118
01:57:59.121 --> 01:58:01.248
Son, come with me.

1119
01:58:04.293 --> 01:58:05.711
Ben.

1120
01:58:06.796 --> 01:58:08.881
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
01:58:27.108 --> 01:58:28.317
It's Vader.

1122
01:58:34.156 --> 01:58:37.743
Luke, it is your destiny.

1123
01:58:45.459 --> 01:58:47.712
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:57.930
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1125
01:59:01.392 --> 01:59:04.145
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1126
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:07.773
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1127
01:59:07.898 --> 01:59:12.320
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1128
01:59:15.489 --> 01:59:16.949
You did it!

1129
02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:17.677
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- <i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1130
02:00:18.719 --> 02:00:22.682
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and</i>
<i>that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1131
02:00:22.807 --> 02:00:25.434
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1132
02:00:25.559 --> 02:00:28.980
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1133
02:00:29.105 --> 02:00:31.315
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1134
02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.150
Take care, you two.

1135
02:00:33.275 --> 02:00:35.319
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1136
