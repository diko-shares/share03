1
00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:36.175
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.177
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

3
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.179
<i>Loud and clear, kid. What's up?</i>

4
00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:41.306
I finished my circle.

5
00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.099
I don't pick up any life readings.

6
00:03:43.182 --> 00:03:46.185
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

7
00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.104
<i>Sensors are placed. I'm going back.</i>

8
00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:50.064
Right. I'll see you shortly.

9
00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:52.025
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

10
00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:54.277
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

11
00:03:55.862 --> 00:03:59.115
Steady, girl. What's the matter?

12
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:00.491
You smell something?

13
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.659
Chewie!

14
00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:44.827
Chewie?

15
00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:46.913
Chewie!

16
00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.876
All right! Don't lose your temper.

17
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.586
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

18
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:15.900
Solo?

19
00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:17.568
No sign of life out there, General.

20
00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.945
The sensors are in place.

21
00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:20.154
You'll know if anything comes around.

22
00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:21.698
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

23
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.117
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

24
00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.244
With all the meteor activity
in this system,

25
00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.079
it's going to be difficult to spot
approaching ships.

26
00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:30.623
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

27
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:31.999
I'm sorry to hear that.

28
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:33.167
Well, there's a price on my head.

29
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.752
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,

30
00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.045
I'm a dead man.

31
00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.214
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

32
00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:40.591
You're a good fighter, Solo.

33
00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:41.843
I hate to lose you.

34
00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:43.219
Thank you, General.

35
00:05:51.686 --> 00:05:53.646
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

36
00:05:54.564 --> 00:05:55.857
That's right.

37
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:00.987
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

38
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:04.824
Han!

39
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:08.369
Yes, Your Highnessness?

40
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:09.954
I thought you had decided to stay.

41
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.790
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

42
00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:14.834
Han, we need you!

43
00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:16.711
- "We need"?
- Yes.

44
00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:18.629
Well, what about you need?

45
00:06:18.713 --> 00:06:19.714
I need?

46
00:06:19.797 --> 00:06:22.008
I don't know what you're talking about.

47
00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:23.885
You probably don't.

48
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:25.970
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

49
00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:27.513
Come on!

50
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:29.807
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

51
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:32.602
Yes! You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

52
00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:35.354
No! That's not it.

53
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:36.773
Come on.

54
00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:38.566
A-ha!

55
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.026
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

56
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:41.903
Am I? Then why are you following me?

57
00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:44.572
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

58
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:45.698
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!

59
00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:47.074
I can arrange that.

60
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.243
You could use a good kiss!

61
00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:51.579
Don't try to blame me.

62
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.289
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

63
00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:56.334
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess' chamber.

64
00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.711
But it's supposed to be freezing.

65
00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.505
How we're going to dry out
all her clothes, I really don't know.

66
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:03.090
Oh, switch off!

67
00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:04.175
Why did you take this apart now?

68
00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:06.093
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

69
00:07:06.177 --> 00:07:07.178
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.262
Put them back together now!

71
00:07:08.346 --> 00:07:09.889
Might I have a word with you, please?

72
00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:11.557
- What do you want?
- Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

73
00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:13.226
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

74
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:15.186
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

75
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.647
Well, Princess Leia
is wondering about Master Luke.

76
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.357
He hasn't come back yet.
She doesn't know where he is.

77
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.317
- I don't know where he is.
- Nobody knows where he is.

78
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.902
What do you mean, nobody knows?

79
00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.904
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

80
00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:26.864
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

81
00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:27.949
Yes, sir?

82
00:07:28.032 --> 00:07:29.450
Do you know
where Commander Skywalker is?

83
00:07:29.534 --> 00:07:30.535
I haven't seen him.

84
00:07:30.618 --> 00:07:32.245
It's possible he came in through
the south entrance.

85
00:07:32.328 --> 00:07:34.789
"It's possible"?
Why don't you go find out?

86
00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:35.957
It's getting dark out there.

87
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.291
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.544
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

89
00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:40.753
Why not?

90
00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:42.129
Impossible man.

91
00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:44.006
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

92
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.510
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

93
00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:59.355
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

94
00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.648
He might have forgotten to check in.

95
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.816
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

96
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.235
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

97
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:05.403
We'll have to go out on tauntauns.

98
00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:07.238
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

99
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:08.781
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

100
00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:16.455
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

101
00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.541
Then I'll see you in hell. Hyah!

102
00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:38.389
You must come along now, R2.

103
00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.516
There's really nothing more we can do.

104
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:42.810
And my joints are freezing up.

105
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:45.396
Don't say things like that!

106
00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:46.856
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

107
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.443
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

108
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:52.403
Stupid little short circuit.

109
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.447
He'll be quite all right.

110
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:54.131
Sir, all the patrols are in.

111
00:11:54.215 --> 00:11:55.216
Still no...

112
00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.928
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

113
00:11:59.345 --> 00:12:02.765
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,

114
00:12:03.182 --> 00:12:05.476
although he does admit
that his own range

115
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.019
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

116
00:12:07.103 --> 00:12:08.938
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

117
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:11.440
The shield doors must be closed.

118
00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:14.026
Close the doors.

119
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.111
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:21.325
R2 says the chances of survival
are 725 to 1.

121
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:36.549
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

122
00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:40.845
from time to time.

123
00:12:41.345 --> 00:12:42.721
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

124
00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:47.768
Don't worry about Master Luke.

125
00:12:47.852 --> 00:12:49.270
I'm sure he'll be all right.

126
00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:51.730
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

127
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.290
<i>Luke.</i>

128
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:12.918
Luke.

129
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:21.927
Ben?

130
00:13:22.011 --> 00:13:24.722
You will go to the Dagobah system.

131
00:13:25.264 --> 00:13:26.640
Dagobah system?

132
00:13:27.224 --> 00:13:29.810
There you will learn from Yoda,

133
00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:33.480
the Jedi master who instructed me.

134
00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.150
Ben!

135
00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:37.818
Ben.

136
00:13:42.573 --> 00:13:43.908
Luke!

137
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:45.367
Luke!

138
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.418
Don't do this, Luke.

139
00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.420
Come on, give me a sign here.

140
00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.362
Not much time.

141
00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:22.613
Ben.

142
00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.073
Ben.

143
00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:30.371
Hang on, kid.

144
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.458
- Dagobah system. Dagobah.
- Whew!

145
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.293
This may smell bad, kid...

146
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.129
Yoda.

147
00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.298
...but it'll keep you warm...

148
00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:43.801
till I get the shelter up.

149
00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:46.178
Ben... Dagobah...

150
00:14:46.262 --> 00:14:47.972
Ahhh!

151
00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:53.269
Ah! I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

152
00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:39.940
Echo Base, I've got something.

153
00:15:40.024 --> 00:15:41.525
Not much, but it could be a life form.

154
00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:48.198
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

155
00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:50.117
This is Rogue Two.

156
00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.661
This is Rogue Two.

157
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.248
Captain Solo, do you copy?

158
00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:05.591
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

159
00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.634
This is Rogue Two.

160
00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.512
<i>Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

161
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.183
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

162
00:16:14.266 --> 00:16:15.559
I've found them.

163
00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.311
Repeat, I've found them.

164
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.761
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

165
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.054
Thanks, 3PO.

166
00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:53.847
R2 expresses his relief also.

167
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.767
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

168
00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:00.521
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

169
00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:02.147
Thanks to you.

170
00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:04.691
That's two you owe me, junior.

171
00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:05.984
Well, Your Worship,

172
00:17:06.068 --> 00:17:08.946
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

173
00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.115
I had nothing to do with it.

174
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.243
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous
for any ships to leave the system

175
00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.577
until we've activated the energy field.

176
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.287
That's a good story.

177
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:18.914
I think you just can't bear to let

178
00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:21.333
a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

179
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:25.003
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

180
00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:30.175
Laugh it up, fuzzball,

181
00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:33.554
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

182
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.098
She expressed her true feelings for me.

183
00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:37.433
My...

184
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:40.602
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted,

185
00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:43.355
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

186
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.316
Who's scruffy-looking?

187
00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:50.946
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark

188
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.031
to get her all riled up like that,
huh, kid?

189
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.329
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

190
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:08.464
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

191
00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:14.595
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

192
00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:15.679
Take it easy.

193
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.681
Excuse us, please.

194
00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:23.270
Princess, we have a visitor.

195
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.065
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

196
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:28.150
It's metal.

197
00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:29.485
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

198
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:31.153
Could be a speeder, one of ours.

199
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:32.446
No.

200
00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.572
Wait.

201
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.366
There's something
very weak coming through.

202
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.706
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

203
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.374
This signal is not used by the Alliance.

204
00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:45.959
It could be an Imperial code.

205
00:18:51.507 --> 00:18:52.758
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.

206
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.259
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

207
00:18:54.343 --> 00:18:56.595
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

208
00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:34.508
<i>I'm afraid there's not much left.</i>

209
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:36.260
- What was it?
<i>- Droid of some kind.</i>

210
00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.637
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

211
00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.722
An Imperial probe droid.

212
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:43.684
<i>It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.</i>

213
00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:45.852
We'd better start the evacuation.

214
00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:32.357
Admiral.

215
00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:33.734
Yes, Captain?

216
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.236
I think we've got something, sir.

217
00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:39.906
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,

218
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.366
but it's the best lead we've had.

219
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.453
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

220
00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:45.621
I want proof, not leads.

221
00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.581
The visuals indicate life readings.

222
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:49.916
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

223
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.836
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

224
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.296
You've found something?

225
00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.505
Yes, my lord.

226
00:20:57.883 --> 00:21:00.302
That's it. The Rebels are there.

227
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:04.931
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

228
00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.016
It could be smugglers...

229
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.643
That is the system.

230
00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:10.270
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

231
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.898
Set your course for the Hoth system.

232
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.275
General Veers, prepare your men.

233
00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.110
Admiral.

234
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.411
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

235
00:21:26.495 --> 00:21:27.954
As soon as each transport is loaded,

236
00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:30.290
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

237
00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:31.375
Right, sir.

238
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.546
All right! That's it.

239
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.673
Try it.

240
00:21:39.508 --> 00:21:42.594
Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off!

241
00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:44.805
Turn it off!

242
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:48.600
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

243
00:21:48.684 --> 00:21:49.685
Forget the heavy equipment.

244
00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:52.062
There's plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports.

245
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.146
Take care, sir.

246
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.231
Thanks.

247
00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.487
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

248
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.410
Okay, okay!

249
00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.121
Hi, kid.

250
00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:11.707
There's got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

251
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:13.375
Wait a second.

252
00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:15.752
You all right?

253
00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:17.087
Yeah.

254
00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:24.803
Be careful.

255
00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:26.763
You, too.

256
00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:35.689
General, there's a fleet
of Star Destroyers

257
00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.441
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

258
00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:40.569
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

259
00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:44.156
We gotta hold them
till all transports are away.

260
00:22:44.281 --> 00:22:45.657
Prepare for ground assault.

261
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.965
What is it, General?

262
00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:03.800
My lord, the fleet
has moved out of light speed.

263
00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:05.927
ComScan has detected
an energy field

264
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.638
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

265
00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.141
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

266
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:13.810
The Rebels are alerted to our presence.

267
00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:17.063
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

268
00:23:17.147 --> 00:23:19.316
He... He felt surprise was wiser.

269
00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:21.735
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

270
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:25.071
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

271
00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:26.740
Yes, my lord.

272
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.248
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

273
00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:37.501
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...</i>

274
00:23:39.336 --> 00:23:42.923
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

275
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.508
Captain Piett.

276
00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.176
<i>Yes, my lord?</i>

277
00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:49.262
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field

278
00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:52.349
and deploy the fleet
so that nothing gets off the system.

279
00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:55.602
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

280
00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:57.020
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

281
00:23:58.772 --> 00:24:02.025
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

282
00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:04.945
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

283
00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:07.113
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

284
00:24:07.197 --> 00:24:09.991
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time,

285
00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:12.619
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

286
00:24:12.702 --> 00:24:15.038
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

287
00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:17.123
The ion cannon
will fire several shots

288
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:20.210
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

289
00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:22.712
When you've gotten past
the energy shield,

290
00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:24.881
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

291
00:24:24.965 --> 00:24:26.633
- Understood?
- Yeah.

292
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:28.051
Good luck.

293
00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:30.053
Okay. Everybody to your stations.

294
00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.221
Let's go.

295
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.825
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

296
00:24:52.033 --> 00:24:53.285
Prepare to open shield.

297
00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.626
Sir, Rebel ships
are coming into our sector.

298
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.795
Good. Our first catch of the day.

299
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.632
Stand by, ion control.

300
00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:09.926
Fire.

301
00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:28.153
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

302
00:25:28.236 --> 00:25:31.823
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

303
00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:39.080
Feeling all right, sir?

304
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:41.166
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

305
00:25:41.374 --> 00:25:44.419
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

306
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:46.671
I know what you mean.

307
00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:06.149
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

308
00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:08.026
<i>We've spotted Imperial walkers.</i>

309
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:10.528
<i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>

310
00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:35.303
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

311
00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.811
All right, boys, keep tight now.

312
00:26:42.894 --> 00:26:45.021
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

313
00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:46.690
Steady, Dak.

314
00:26:46.773 --> 00:26:48.650
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

315
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:53.905
All right. I'm coming in.

316
00:26:58.618 --> 00:26:59.953
Hobbie, you still with me?

317
00:27:22.517 --> 00:27:24.519
That armour's too strong for blasters.

318
00:27:26.896 --> 00:27:29.065
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

319
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:31.317
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

320
00:27:33.528 --> 00:27:34.988
All right. Stand by, Dak.

321
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:37.949
Oh, Luke,
we've got a malfunction in fire control.

322
00:27:38.033 --> 00:27:39.993
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

323
00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:42.787
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.

324
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:44.998
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

325
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:48.209
Ah!

326
00:27:50.295 --> 00:27:51.296
Dak?

327
00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:52.380
Dak!

328
00:28:15.612 --> 00:28:18.323
Yes, Lord Vader,
I've reached the main power generators.

329
00:28:18.406 --> 00:28:19.991
The shield will be down in moments.

330
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:21.493
You may start your landing.

331
00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:27.832
Rogue Three.

332
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:29.042
Copy, Rogue Leader.

333
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.044
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.</i>

334
00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:32.337
<i>You'll have to make this shot.</i>

335
00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:34.214
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

336
00:28:34.297 --> 00:28:36.591
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

337
00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:39.969
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

338
00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:45.100
Steady, Rogue Two.

339
00:28:45.183 --> 00:28:46.267
Activate harpoon.

340
00:28:49.229 --> 00:28:50.897
Good shot, Janson.

341
00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.155
- One more pass.
- Coming around, once more.

342
00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:06.996
Cable out. Let her go!

343
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.957
Detach cable.

344
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.166
Cable detached.

345
00:29:18.174 --> 00:29:19.926
Come on.

346
00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:28.184
Hah! That got him!

347
00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:29.811
I see it, Wedge. Good work.

348
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:32.730
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

349
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:35.066
It's risky,
but we can't hold out much longer.

350
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.402
We have no choice.

351
00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:38.486
Launch patrol.

352
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.196
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

353
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.115
Gahhh!

354
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:44.742
No, no! No.

355
00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:46.744
This one goes there.

356
00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:48.955
That one goes there, right?

357
00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:52.584
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

358
00:29:54.085 --> 00:29:56.337
And do take good care of yourself.

359
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:01.885
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

360
00:30:25.575 --> 00:30:27.785
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

361
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:30.038
Prepare to target the main generator.

362
00:30:34.042 --> 00:30:35.043
Rogue Two, are you all right?

363
00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:37.462
Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

364
00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:39.505
Well, set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

365
00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:42.383
Coming around.

366
00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:45.303
Watch that cross fire, boys.

367
00:30:45.386 --> 00:30:47.263
Set for position three.

368
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:48.806
Steady.

369
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.099
Stay tight and low.

370
00:30:50.183 --> 00:30:51.309
This is it!

371
00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:52.810
Aah!

372
00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:58.399
Hobbie!

373
00:30:58.483 --> 00:31:00.109
I've been hit!

374
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.528
You all right?

375
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:45.530
Why are you still here?

376
00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:47.198
Heard the command centre
had been hit.

377
00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:48.533
You've got your clearance to leave.

378
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:50.493
Don't worry. I'll leave.

379
00:31:50.576 --> 00:31:52.328
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

380
00:31:52.412 --> 00:31:54.038
Your Highness,
we must take this last transport.

381
00:31:54.122 --> 00:31:55.123
It's our only hope.

382
00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:58.501
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the
south slope to protect the fighters.

383
00:31:58.584 --> 00:31:59.794
Ah!

384
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:02.171
<i>Imperial troops have entered the base.</i>

385
00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:03.548
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

386
00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:05.258
Come on. That's it.

387
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:07.885
Give the evacuation code signal.

388
00:32:10.346 --> 00:32:11.639
And get to your transports!

389
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:13.641
Oh! Wait for me!

390
00:32:13.891 --> 00:32:17.312
Begin retreat! Fall back!

391
00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:17.622
Distance to power generators?

392
00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:18.998
<i>17.28.</i>

393
00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:30.385
Target. Maximum firepower.

394
00:33:56.494 --> 00:33:59.372
Transport, this is Solo.
Better take off. I can't get to you.

395
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:01.332
I'll get her out on the <i>Falcon.</i>
Come on.

396
00:34:02.583 --> 00:34:04.669
B-B-But where are you going?

397
00:34:04.752 --> 00:34:05.878
Come back!

398
00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:24.689
Wait!

399
00:34:24.772 --> 00:34:27.358
Wait for me! Wait! Stop!

400
00:34:28.067 --> 00:34:29.694
- How typical.
- Come on.

401
00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:34.574
Hurry up, goldenrod.

402
00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:36.325
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

403
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.743
Wait! Wait!

404
00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:57.430
How's this?

405
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.557
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

406
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.808
Captain Solo! Captain Solo!

407
00:35:00.892 --> 00:35:01.893
It might.

408
00:35:03.269 --> 00:35:05.813
Sir, might I suggest that you...

409
00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:07.732
It can wait.

410
00:35:11.819 --> 00:35:14.238
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

411
00:35:14.322 --> 00:35:16.657
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

412
00:35:25.625 --> 00:35:27.210
Come on! Come on!

413
00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:29.837
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

414
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.591
See?

415
00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:36.093
Someday you're gonna be wrong,
and I just hope I'm there to see it.

416
00:35:38.638 --> 00:35:39.805
Punch it!

417
00:35:57.615 --> 00:35:59.033
R2!

418
00:35:59.116 --> 00:36:01.577
Get her ready for take-off.

419
00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:07.166
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

420
00:36:10.086 --> 00:36:12.713
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

421
00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:26.561
There's nothing wrong, R2.

422
00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:28.688
I'm just setting a new course.

423
00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:33.526
We're not gonna regroup with the others.

424
00:36:34.694 --> 00:36:36.404
We're going to the Dagobah system.

425
00:36:38.406 --> 00:36:40.157
Yes, R2?

426
00:36:42.702 --> 00:36:43.744
That's all right.

427
00:36:43.828 --> 00:36:45.871
I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

428
00:37:02.763 --> 00:37:03.931
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

429
00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:05.266
Saw what?

430
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:07.518
Star Destroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

431
00:37:07.602 --> 00:37:09.145
Sir! Sir! Might I suggest...

432
00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:10.646
Shut him up or shut him down!

433
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.233
Check the deflector shield.

434
00:37:15.192 --> 00:37:16.235
Great.

435
00:37:16.319 --> 00:37:18.112
Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them.

436
00:37:22.617 --> 00:37:24.535
Take evasive action!

437
00:37:36.255 --> 00:37:37.882
Prepare to make the jump
to light speed.

438
00:37:37.965 --> 00:37:38.966
But, sir!

439
00:37:39.425 --> 00:37:41.052
They're getting closer.

440
00:37:41.636 --> 00:37:43.763
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

441
00:37:46.974 --> 00:37:48.309
Watch what?

442
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:51.354
I think we're in trouble.

443
00:37:51.437 --> 00:37:53.230
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier

444
00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:54.982
the hyperdrive motivator
has been damaged.

445
00:37:55.232 --> 00:37:56.859
It's impossible to go to light speed.

446
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:58.069
We're in trouble.

447
00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:03.991
Horizontal boosters!

448
00:38:04.283 --> 00:38:06.243
Gahhh!

449
00:38:06.327 --> 00:38:08.371
Alluvial dampers.

450
00:38:09.497 --> 00:38:11.666
Ow! That's not it.

451
00:38:11.749 --> 00:38:13.209
Bring me the hydrospanner!

452
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.006
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

453
00:38:21.509 --> 00:38:22.677
Ow!

454
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.844
Chewie!

455
00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:29.600
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

456
00:38:29.684 --> 00:38:31.310
Han, get up here!

457
00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:34.021
Come on, Chewie!

458
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.273
Asteroids.

459
00:38:36.649 --> 00:38:37.817
Oh, no.

460
00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:41.278
Chewie, set two-seven-one.

461
00:38:41.696 --> 00:38:42.697
What are you doing?

462
00:38:43.823 --> 00:38:46.450
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

463
00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:48.369
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

464
00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:53.457
You don't have to do this to impress me.

465
00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:55.793
Sir, the possibility
of successfully navigating

466
00:38:55.876 --> 00:38:58.379
an asteroid field
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

467
00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:00.047
Never tell me the odds!

468
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:24.739
Look out!

469
00:39:27.908 --> 00:39:29.994
You said you wanted
to be around when I made a mistake.

470
00:39:30.077 --> 00:39:32.913
- This could be it, sweetheart.
- I take it back.

471
00:39:32.997 --> 00:39:36.000
We're going to get pulverised
if we stay out here much longer.

472
00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:38.544
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverised?

473
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:40.004
I'm going in closer
to one of the big ones.

474
00:39:40.129 --> 00:39:41.714
- Closer?
- Closer?

475
00:39:41.797 --> 00:39:42.840
Gahhh!

476
00:40:09.033 --> 00:40:10.951
Oh, this is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

477
00:40:11.035 --> 00:40:13.037
There. That looks pretty good.

478
00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:14.789
What looks pretty good?

479
00:40:14.872 --> 00:40:16.957
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

480
00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:19.794
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

481
00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:32.890
I hope you know what you're doing.

482
00:40:32.973 --> 00:40:34.308
Yeah. Me, too.

483
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.402
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

484
00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.949
No, I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

485
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.494
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

486
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:56.038
Massive life form readings, though.

487
00:40:56.997 --> 00:40:58.749
There's something alive down there.

488
00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:03.045
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

489
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:11.804
I know! I know!

490
00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:14.515
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

491
00:41:15.558 --> 00:41:16.767
Just hang on.

492
00:41:16.851 --> 00:41:18.727
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

493
00:42:12.573 --> 00:42:15.117
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

494
00:42:19.914 --> 00:42:21.040
R2?

495
00:42:21.749 --> 00:42:22.750
R2!

496
00:42:25.085 --> 00:42:26.211
Where are you?

497
00:42:29.548 --> 00:42:30.966
R2!

498
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:39.725
You be more careful.

499
00:42:42.686 --> 00:42:45.522
R2, that way.

500
00:43:13.384 --> 00:43:14.677
R2!

501
00:43:42.246 --> 00:43:43.497
Oh, no.

502
00:43:44.832 --> 00:43:45.916
Are you all right?

503
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.335
Come on.

504
00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:52.923
You were lucky to get out of there.

505
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:54.967
Anything broken?

506
00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:01.265
If you're saying coming here
was a bad idea,

507
00:44:01.348 --> 00:44:02.891
I'm beginning to agree with you.

508
00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:06.145
R2, what are we doing here?

509
00:44:06.729 --> 00:44:11.442
It's like...
something out of a dream or...

510
00:44:12.192 --> 00:44:13.819
I don't know.

511
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:16.238
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

512
00:44:48.854 --> 00:44:49.938
Yes, Admiral?

513
00:44:50.481 --> 00:44:52.733
Our ships have sighted
the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord,

514
00:44:52.816 --> 00:44:55.486
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

515
00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:58.030
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

516
00:44:58.447 --> 00:45:01.325
I want that ship, not excuses.

517
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.951
Yes, lord.

518
00:45:08.373 --> 00:45:11.418
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

519
00:45:11.502 --> 00:45:13.337
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,

520
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.506
but does that include
shutting me down, too?

521
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:17.841
No. I need you to talk to the <i>Falcon.</i>

522
00:45:17.925 --> 00:45:19.760
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

523
00:45:27.935 --> 00:45:31.230
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

524
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:33.398
Not entirely stable?

525
00:45:33.482 --> 00:45:35.442
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

526
00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:39.029
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

527
00:45:39.446 --> 00:45:42.032
Sometimes I just don't understand
human behaviour.

528
00:45:42.116 --> 00:45:44.451
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

529
00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:50.791
- Let go.
- Shh!

530
00:45:52.459 --> 00:45:53.877
Let go, please.

531
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:55.212
Don't get excited.

532
00:45:55.295 --> 00:45:58.423
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

533
00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.717
Sorry, sweetheart.

534
00:46:00.801 --> 00:46:02.761
I haven't got time for anything else.

535
00:46:37.796 --> 00:46:38.797
What?

536
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:40.716
Ready for some power?

537
00:46:40.799 --> 00:46:41.842
Okay.

538
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:46.388
Let's see now.

539
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.265
Put that in there.

540
00:46:48.682 --> 00:46:49.850
There you go.

541
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:54.438
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

542
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:56.815
if he even exists.

543
00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:06.158
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

544
00:47:07.701 --> 00:47:09.578
This place gives me the creeps.

545
00:47:13.207 --> 00:47:14.499
Still...

546
00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:18.212
there's something familiar
about this place.

547
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.924
I don't know.

548
00:47:22.007 --> 00:47:23.091
I feel like...

549
00:47:23.175 --> 00:47:24.593
Feel like what?

550
00:47:25.427 --> 00:47:27.137
Like we're being watched!

551
00:47:27.221 --> 00:47:30.140
Away put your weapon!
I mean you no harm.

552
00:47:31.225 --> 00:47:34.186
I am wondering... why are you here?

553
00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:37.272
I'm looking for someone.

554
00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:38.815
Looking?

555
00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:42.277
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmm?

556
00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:44.363
Right.

557
00:47:45.072 --> 00:47:47.824
Help you I can. Yes, mmm.

558
00:47:48.492 --> 00:47:49.910
I don't think so.

559
00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:52.412
I'm looking for a great warrior.

560
00:47:52.496 --> 00:47:53.705
Ah!

561
00:47:54.248 --> 00:47:56.083
A great warrior.

562
00:47:58.585 --> 00:48:00.504
Wars not make one great.

563
00:48:09.596 --> 00:48:10.847
Put that down.

564
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:13.433
Hey! That's my dinner!

565
00:48:16.103 --> 00:48:19.356
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

566
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:21.525
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

567
00:48:21.608 --> 00:48:23.360
And if we could get our ship out,
we would.

568
00:48:23.443 --> 00:48:24.486
But we can't, so why don't you...

569
00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:26.488
Cannot get your ship out. Hee hee hee!

570
00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:28.031
Hey, get out of there!

571
00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:29.366
Ah!

572
00:48:29.449 --> 00:48:31.493
No! Ooh!

573
00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:33.287
Hey, you could have broken this.

574
00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:36.164
Don't do that.

575
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:39.376
Oh!

576
00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:48.468
You're making a mess.

577
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.347
Hey, give me that!

578
00:48:52.431 --> 00:48:55.058
Mine, or I will help you not.

579
00:48:55.142 --> 00:48:56.977
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

580
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.062
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

581
00:48:59.146 --> 00:49:00.981
Mudhole? Slimy?

582
00:49:01.064 --> 00:49:02.399
My home this is.

583
00:49:02.816 --> 00:49:05.360
Wha...

584
00:49:05.986 --> 00:49:07.529
R2, let him have it.

585
00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:11.950
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

586
00:49:12.034 --> 00:49:13.118
R2!

587
00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:17.873
Now, will you move along, little fellow?

588
00:49:17.956 --> 00:49:19.416
We've got a lot of work to do.

589
00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:21.084
No! No, no!

590
00:49:21.168 --> 00:49:24.546
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

591
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:28.342
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

592
00:49:28.717 --> 00:49:32.596
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

593
00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:34.306
You seek Yoda.

594
00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:35.515
You know him?

595
00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:39.102
Mmm. Take you to him I will.

596
00:49:39.186 --> 00:49:43.899
Yes, yes,
but now we must eat. Come.

597
00:49:44.608 --> 00:49:46.109
Good food. Come.

598
00:49:56.078 --> 00:49:57.954
Come, come.

599
00:49:59.748 --> 00:50:03.627
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

600
00:50:17.224 --> 00:50:19.976
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

601
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.105
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate,

602
00:50:23.188 --> 00:50:24.981
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

603
00:50:25.065 --> 00:50:26.733
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling

604
00:50:26.817 --> 00:50:28.485
on the negative axis has been polarised.

605
00:50:28.568 --> 00:50:31.113
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

606
00:50:31.738 --> 00:50:34.408
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

607
00:50:35.325 --> 00:50:37.119
Here! And, Chewie...

608
00:50:39.538 --> 00:50:41.581
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

609
00:51:04.104 --> 00:51:07.274
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

610
00:51:07.357 --> 00:51:09.609
Would you please stop calling me that?

611
00:51:09.693 --> 00:51:11.778
Sure, Leia.

612
00:51:11.987 --> 00:51:13.989
You make it so difficult sometimes.

613
00:51:14.072 --> 00:51:16.032
I do. I really do.

614
00:51:16.199 --> 00:51:18.660
You could be a little nicer, though.

615
00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:21.663
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

616
00:51:23.582 --> 00:51:26.084
Occasionally... maybe...

617
00:51:26.168 --> 00:51:28.628
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

618
00:51:28.712 --> 00:51:30.547
Scoundrel?

619
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.257
Scoundrel?

620
00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:36.052
I like the sound of that.

621
00:51:37.053 --> 00:51:38.054
Stop that.

622
00:51:38.346 --> 00:51:39.723
Stop what?

623
00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:42.058
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

624
00:51:42.142 --> 00:51:44.519
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

625
00:51:44.603 --> 00:51:45.729
Afraid?

626
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:47.522
You're trembling.

627
00:51:47.606 --> 00:51:49.316
I'm not trembling.

628
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:52.986
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

629
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.072
There aren't enough scoundrels
in your life.

630
00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:57.908
I happen to like nice men.

631
00:51:58.575 --> 00:51:59.576
I'm a nice man.

632
00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:01.119
No, you're not. You're...

633
00:52:04.164 --> 00:52:07.834
Sir, sir! I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

634
00:52:10.212 --> 00:52:11.421
Thank you.

635
00:52:11.505 --> 00:52:12.756
Thank you very much.

636
00:52:12.839 --> 00:52:14.674
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

637
00:52:20.722 --> 00:52:24.100
<i>And that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

638
00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:25.602
<i>Considering the amount of damage
we've sustained,</i>

639
00:52:25.685 --> 00:52:27.103
<i>they must have been destroyed.</i>

640
00:52:27.187 --> 00:52:29.689
No, Captain. They're alive.

641
00:52:30.273 --> 00:52:34.861
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

642
00:52:38.782 --> 00:52:40.242
Lord Vader.

643
00:52:41.034 --> 00:52:42.244
Yes, Admiral. What is it?

644
00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:44.746
The Emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

645
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:47.332
Move the ship out of the asteroid field

646
00:52:47.415 --> 00:52:49.668
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

647
00:52:49.834 --> 00:52:51.253
Yes, my lord.

648
00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:10.647
What is thy bidding, my master?

649
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:15.944
<i>There is a great disturbance
in the Force.</i>

650
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.363
I have felt it.

651
00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:21.700
<i>We have a new enemy,</i>

652
00:53:21.908 --> 00:53:25.912
<i>the young Rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.</i>

653
00:53:26.621 --> 00:53:33.587
<i>I have no doubt this boy
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

654
00:53:33.795 --> 00:53:36.172
How is that possible?

655
00:53:36.256 --> 00:53:39.676
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

656
00:53:39.759 --> 00:53:42.387
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

657
00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:45.557
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

658
00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.767
He's just a boy.

659
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:50.395
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

660
00:53:50.687 --> 00:53:54.441
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

661
00:53:55.275 --> 00:54:00.238
<i>The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.</i>

662
00:54:00.614 --> 00:54:02.657
If he could be turned,

663
00:54:02.741 --> 00:54:05.619
he would become a powerful ally.

664
00:54:06.536 --> 00:54:08.622
<i>Yes.</i>

665
00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:12.792
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

666
00:54:13.627 --> 00:54:15.879
<i>Can it be done?</i>

667
00:54:15.962 --> 00:54:19.341
He will join us or die, master.

668
00:54:36.608 --> 00:54:37.859
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

669
00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:40.320
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

670
00:54:40.403 --> 00:54:41.404
Patience!

671
00:54:41.488 --> 00:54:44.074
For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

672
00:54:44.157 --> 00:54:45.575
Hmm?

673
00:54:47.452 --> 00:54:49.663
Eat, eat.

674
00:54:50.538 --> 00:54:51.623
Hot!

675
00:54:59.464 --> 00:55:01.508
Good food! Mmm, good, hmm?

676
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:04.636
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

677
00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:06.513
Not far. Yoda not far.

678
00:55:07.013 --> 00:55:09.641
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

679
00:55:12.185 --> 00:55:13.645
Root leaf.

680
00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:15.230
I cook.

681
00:55:16.648 --> 00:55:20.235
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

682
00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:21.945
Mostly because of my father, I guess.

683
00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:24.114
Ah, father.

684
00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:25.782
Powerful Jedi was he.

685
00:55:25.865 --> 00:55:28.910
Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.

686
00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:30.078
Oh, come on.

687
00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:31.287
How could you know my father?

688
00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:32.956
You don't even know who I am.

689
00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:35.875
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

690
00:55:37.919 --> 00:55:39.796
I cannot teach him.

691
00:55:40.463 --> 00:55:42.424
The boy has no patience.

692
00:55:42.674 --> 00:55:44.968
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

693
00:55:45.051 --> 00:55:46.386
Hmm...

694
00:55:49.806 --> 00:55:52.392
Much anger in him,

695
00:55:52.726 --> 00:55:54.436
like his father.

696
00:55:54.519 --> 00:55:57.272
<i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>

697
00:55:59.482 --> 00:56:01.359
No.

698
00:56:01.526 --> 00:56:03.194
He is not ready.

699
00:56:03.278 --> 00:56:04.571
Yoda.

700
00:56:07.866 --> 00:56:09.325
I am ready.

701
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:10.660
Ben... I can be a Jedi.

702
00:56:10.744 --> 00:56:12.704
Ben, tell him I'm...

703
00:56:12.787 --> 00:56:14.330
Ready, are you?

704
00:56:14.414 --> 00:56:16.583
What know you ready?

705
00:56:16.666 --> 00:56:20.628
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

706
00:56:20.712 --> 00:56:24.382
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

707
00:56:26.468 --> 00:56:30.430
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

708
00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:32.432
The most serious mind.

709
00:56:34.017 --> 00:56:37.145
This one a long time have I watched.

710
00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:41.232
All his life has he looked away...

711
00:56:41.441 --> 00:56:44.527
to the future, to the horizon.

712
00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:48.031
Never his mind on where he was,

713
00:56:48.114 --> 00:56:49.365
hmm?

714
00:56:49.449 --> 00:56:51.409
What he was doing.

715
00:56:51.493 --> 00:56:52.952
Hmph!

716
00:56:53.244 --> 00:56:54.329
Adventure.

717
00:56:54.412 --> 00:56:55.413
Ha!

718
00:56:55.497 --> 00:56:56.831
Excitement. Ha!

719
00:56:57.165 --> 00:56:59.626
A Jedi craves not these things.

720
00:57:00.502 --> 00:57:02.420
You are reckless!

721
00:57:02.504 --> 00:57:05.507
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

722
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.258
He is too old.

723
00:57:08.718 --> 00:57:11.304
Yes, too old to begin the training.

724
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:13.681
But I've learned so much.

725
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:18.561
Ahh...

726
00:57:21.356 --> 00:57:23.066
Will he finish what he begins?

727
00:57:23.525 --> 00:57:25.276
I won't fail you.

728
00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:28.029
I'm not afraid.

729
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:30.782
Oh...

730
00:57:32.492 --> 00:57:34.160
You will be.

731
00:57:35.787 --> 00:57:37.455
You will be.

732
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:19.831
Aah!

733
00:58:19.914 --> 00:58:21.583
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

734
00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:23.293
I'm not really interested
in your opinion, 3PO.

735
00:58:23.376 --> 00:58:24.627
There's something out there.

736
00:58:25.628 --> 00:58:26.629
Where?

737
00:58:26.713 --> 00:58:27.714
Outside in the cave.

738
00:58:29.299 --> 00:58:30.717
There it is. Listen. Listen!

739
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.843
I'm going out there.

740
00:58:31.926 --> 00:58:32.927
Are you crazy?

741
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:34.012
I just got this bucket back together.

742
00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:35.680
I'm not going to let something
tear it apart.

743
00:58:35.763 --> 00:58:37.557
Oh! Then I'm going with you.

744
00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:40.018
I think it might be better

745
00:58:40.101 --> 00:58:42.145
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

746
00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:43.229
Oh, no.

747
00:58:57.994 --> 00:59:00.538
This ground sure feels strange.

748
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:03.708
It doesn't feel like rock.

749
00:59:07.337 --> 00:59:08.463
Hmm.

750
00:59:08.546 --> 00:59:10.340
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

751
00:59:10.798 --> 00:59:11.883
I don't know.

752
00:59:12.508 --> 00:59:15.011
I have a bad feeling about this.

753
00:59:15.386 --> 00:59:16.471
Yeah.

754
00:59:17.931 --> 00:59:18.932
Watch out!

755
00:59:20.183 --> 00:59:21.434
It's all right.

756
00:59:21.517 --> 00:59:22.518
It's all right.

757
00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:25.480
Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.

758
00:59:25.563 --> 00:59:28.816
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached,

759
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.860
chewing on the power cables.

760
00:59:30.944 --> 00:59:32.403
Mynocks.

761
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:34.739
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

762
00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:40.286
Han!

763
00:59:42.747 --> 00:59:45.458
Aagghh! Go away, go away, beastly thing!

764
00:59:45.541 --> 00:59:46.626
Shoo! Shoo!

765
00:59:53.466 --> 00:59:55.385
Wait a minute...

766
01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:18.366
Let's get out of here!

767
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.660
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

768
01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.412
No time to discuss this in committee!

769
01:00:23.246 --> 01:00:25.248
I'm not a committee!

770
01:00:31.212 --> 01:00:33.923
You can't make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field.

771
01:00:34.007 --> 01:00:36.175
Sit down, sweetheart! We're taking off!

772
01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.597
Look!

773
01:00:41.681 --> 01:00:42.849
I see it. I see it.

774
01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:43.933
We're doomed!

775
01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:45.268
The cave is collapsing.

776
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:47.353
- This is no cave.
- What?

777
01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:20.970
Run!

778
01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:26.059
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

779
01:01:26.142 --> 01:01:27.935
But beware of the dark side.

780
01:01:28.019 --> 01:01:29.729
Anger, fear, aggression...

781
01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:32.899
The dark side of the Force are they,

782
01:01:32.982 --> 01:01:35.902
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

783
01:01:35.985 --> 01:01:38.279
If once you start down the dark path,

784
01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:40.406
forever will it dominate your destiny.

785
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:41.824
Consume you it will,

786
01:01:41.908 --> 01:01:43.993
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

787
01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:45.828
Vader.

788
01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.122
Is the dark side stronger?

789
01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:49.707
No, no.

790
01:01:49.999 --> 01:01:51.084
No.

791
01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:53.711
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

792
01:01:54.587 --> 01:01:56.672
But how am I to know
the good side from the bad?

793
01:01:56.756 --> 01:02:00.259
You will know when you are calm,

794
01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:01.928
at peace,

795
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.721
passive.

796
01:02:03.805 --> 01:02:08.851
Hmm. A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence,

797
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.062
never for attack.

798
01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.146
But tell me why I can't...

799
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:14.273
No, no. There is no why.

800
01:02:14.607 --> 01:02:17.151
Nothing more will I teach you today.

801
01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:19.862
Clear your mind of questions.

802
01:02:20.947 --> 01:02:23.699
Hmm...

803
01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:25.284
Mmm...

804
01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:44.554
There's something not right here.

805
01:02:48.558 --> 01:02:50.143
I feel cold...

806
01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.519
death.

807
01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.688
That place...

808
01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.899
is strong with the dark side
of the Force.

809
01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:59.485
A domain of evil it is.

810
01:03:00.903 --> 01:03:02.655
In you must go.

811
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.241
What's in there?

812
01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.370
Only what you take with you.

813
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.084
Your weapons...

814
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:17.628
you will not need them.

815
01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:46.569
Hmph.

816
01:05:57.288 --> 01:05:59.749
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

817
01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:01.042
Yes, sir.

818
01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.210
Those Rebels won't escape us.

819
01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:11.677
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer <i>Avenger.</i>

820
01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.095
Right.

821
01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.931
There will be a substantial reward

822
01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:19.560
for the one who finds
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

823
01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:22.646
You are free to use
any methods necessary,

824
01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:24.982
but I want them alive.

825
01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:27.401
No disintegrations.

826
01:06:27.485 --> 01:06:28.569
As you wish.

827
01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:30.029
Lord Vader.

828
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.574
My lord, we have them.

829
01:06:38.204 --> 01:06:41.332
Oh, thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

830
01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:48.381
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

831
01:06:48.923 --> 01:06:50.091
One...

832
01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:51.926
two...

833
01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.177
three!

834
01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.142
It's not fair.

835
01:07:00.226 --> 01:07:01.560
Gahhh!

836
01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:06.065
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault!

837
01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.149
No light speed?

838
01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.151
It's not my fault.

839
01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:15.950
Sir, we've just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

840
01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.244
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

841
01:07:18.494 --> 01:07:19.578
Turn her around.

842
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:21.038
I said, turn her around.

843
01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:22.581
I'm going to put all power
in the front shield.

844
01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:23.666
You're going to attack them?

845
01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:24.834
Sir, the odds of surviving

846
01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.752
a direct assault on
an Imperial Star Destroyer...

847
01:07:26.836 --> 01:07:28.796
- Shut up!
- Gaahh!

848
01:07:35.469 --> 01:07:37.471
They're moving to attack position.

849
01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.016
Shields up.

850
01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.108
Track them.
They may come around for another pass.

851
01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:51.527
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

852
01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:53.529
They can't have disappeared.

853
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:56.240
No ship that small
has a cloaking device.

854
01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:57.825
Well, there's no trace of them, sir.

855
01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.035
Captain, Lord Vader
demands an update on the pursuit.

856
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:04.373
Get a shuttle ready.

857
01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.001
I shall assume full responsibility
for losing them

858
01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.711
and apologise to Lord Vader.

859
01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.713
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.

860
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.631
Yes, Captain Needa.

861
01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:19.388
Use the Force.

862
01:08:19.472 --> 01:08:20.473
Yes.

863
01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.563
Now, the stone...

864
01:08:31.984 --> 01:08:34.028
Feel it.

865
01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:47.082
Concentrate!

866
01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:05.100
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

867
01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:06.810
So certain are you.

868
01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:13.859
Always with you it cannot be done.

869
01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:17.363
Hear you nothing that I say?

870
01:09:17.446 --> 01:09:19.490
Master, moving stones around
is one thing.

871
01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.200
This is totally different.

872
01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:23.244
No! No different!

873
01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:25.621
Only different in your mind.

874
01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:29.458
You must unlearn what you have learned.

875
01:09:30.543 --> 01:09:32.127
All right. I'll give it a try.

876
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:33.796
No! Try not.

877
01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:36.257
Do.

878
01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.591
Or do not.

879
01:09:37.967 --> 01:09:39.593
There is no try.

880
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:30.185
I can't. It's too big.

881
01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:34.231
Size matters not. Look at me.

882
01:10:34.315 --> 01:10:36.525
Judge me by my size, do you?

883
01:10:36.609 --> 01:10:37.610
Hmm?

884
01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:39.236
Hmph!

885
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.488
And well you should not,

886
01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:44.700
for my ally is the Force.

887
01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.703
And a powerful ally it is.

888
01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:50.164
Life creates it,

889
01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:52.124
makes it grow.

890
01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.712
Its energy surrounds us...

891
01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.714
and binds us.

892
01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:01.133
Luminous beings are we,

893
01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:02.968
not this crude matter.

894
01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:07.306
You must feel the Force around you.

895
01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:10.684
Here, between you, me,

896
01:11:11.226 --> 01:11:14.605
the tree, the rock, everywhere!

897
01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:16.565
Yes...

898
01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:21.070
Even between the land and the ship.

899
01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.993
You want the impossible.

900
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:04.548
Mmm...

901
01:13:15.768 --> 01:13:16.769
I don't...

902
01:13:16.852 --> 01:13:19.188
I don't believe it.

903
01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:22.441
That is why you fail.

904
01:13:41.752 --> 01:13:45.839
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

905
01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:55.557
Lord Vader, our ships have completed

906
01:13:55.641 --> 01:13:57.226
their scan of the area
and found nothing.

907
01:13:57.309 --> 01:13:59.311
If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
went into light speed

908
01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:01.063
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

909
01:14:01.146 --> 01:14:02.314
Alert all commands.

910
01:14:02.815 --> 01:14:07.528
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

911
01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:08.862
Yes, my lord. We'll find them.

912
01:14:08.946 --> 01:14:10.989
Don't fail me again...

913
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.075
Admiral.

914
01:14:15.744 --> 01:14:17.371
Alert all commands.

915
01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.122
Deploy the fleet.

916
01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:36.181
Captain Solo,
this time you've gone too far.

917
01:14:36.265 --> 01:14:37.391
Gahhh!

918
01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:40.602
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

919
01:14:40.686 --> 01:14:41.937
The fleet's beginning to break up.

920
01:14:42.855 --> 01:14:45.482
Go back and stand by
the manual release for the landing claw.

921
01:14:47.985 --> 01:14:50.153
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

922
01:14:50.362 --> 01:14:53.824
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

923
01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:55.784
The Empire may be gracious enough...

924
01:14:55.868 --> 01:14:56.869
Thank you.

925
01:14:56.952 --> 01:14:58.662
What do you have in your mind
for your next move?

926
01:14:58.745 --> 01:15:00.664
If they follow standard
Imperial procedure,

927
01:15:00.747 --> 01:15:02.708
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed,

928
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.710
and then we just float away.

929
01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:07.504
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

930
01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:10.340
Then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here.

931
01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:11.717
Any ideas?

932
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.135
Where are we?

933
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:14.720
The Anoat system.

934
01:15:14.803 --> 01:15:16.722
I know that system.
There's not much there.

935
01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:20.684
No. Well, wait. This is interesting.

936
01:15:20.767 --> 01:15:21.852
Lando.

937
01:15:21.935 --> 01:15:23.478
Lando system?

938
01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:26.815
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

939
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:30.235
He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.

940
01:15:30.319 --> 01:15:32.321
- You'd like him.
- Thanks.

941
01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:35.574
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

942
01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.868
A mining colony?

943
01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:39.995
Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

944
01:15:40.412 --> 01:15:42.998
Lando conned somebody out of it.

945
01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:45.918
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

946
01:15:46.752 --> 01:15:47.961
Can you trust him?

947
01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:52.382
No. But he's got no love for the Empire,
I can tell you that.

948
01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:55.510
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.

949
01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:56.720
Detach.

950
01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:05.437
You do have your moments.

951
01:16:05.854 --> 01:16:07.189
Not many of them,

952
01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:08.941
but you do have them.

953
01:16:43.558 --> 01:16:45.227
Concentrate.

954
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:48.605
Feel the Force flow.

955
01:16:48.689 --> 01:16:50.857
Yes.

956
01:16:58.156 --> 01:16:59.241
Good.

957
01:17:00.075 --> 01:17:01.576
Calm.

958
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.078
Yes.

959
01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:06.623
Through the Force, things you will see.

960
01:17:06.707 --> 01:17:10.168
Other places. The future. The past.

961
01:17:10.252 --> 01:17:12.838
Old friends long gone.

962
01:17:15.007 --> 01:17:16.258
Han?

963
01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:17.843
Leia!

964
01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:23.181
Hmm...

965
01:17:23.265 --> 01:17:24.766
Control, control.

966
01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:26.768
You must learn control!

967
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:33.025
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

968
01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:34.651
Hmm...

969
01:17:34.735 --> 01:17:37.237
Friends you have there.

970
01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:39.281
They were in pain.

971
01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:41.867
It is the future you see.

972
01:17:43.368 --> 01:17:44.369
Future?

973
01:17:53.003 --> 01:17:54.296
Will they die?

974
01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:59.134
Difficult to see.

975
01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:02.012
Always in motion is the future.

976
01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:06.683
I've got to go to them.

977
01:18:08.268 --> 01:18:10.896
Decide you must how to serve them best.

978
01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:13.774
If you leave now, help them you could,

979
01:18:15.317 --> 01:18:18.945
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

980
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:35.837
No, I don't have a landing permit.

981
01:18:35.921 --> 01:18:39.841
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

982
01:18:39.925 --> 01:18:42.010
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

983
01:18:42.094 --> 01:18:43.845
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

984
01:18:43.929 --> 01:18:45.180
Rather touchy, aren't they?

985
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.973
I thought you knew this person.

986
01:18:47.057 --> 01:18:48.975
Gaah!

987
01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.894
That was a long time ago.

988
01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:52.395
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

989
01:19:01.154 --> 01:19:04.908
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 3-2-7.</i>

990
01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:06.368
Thank you.

991
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.370
Nothing to worry about.

992
01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:10.163
We go way back, Lando and me.

993
01:19:10.664 --> 01:19:12.040
Who's worried?

994
01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.215
Oh. No one to meet us.

995
01:20:03.508 --> 01:20:04.551
I don't like this.

996
01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.095
Well, what would you like?

997
01:20:07.179 --> 01:20:08.889
They did let us land.

998
01:20:08.972 --> 01:20:11.641
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

999
01:20:11.725 --> 01:20:12.893
Trust me.

1000
01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:19.691
See? My friend.

1001
01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.448
Keep your eyes open, huh?

1002
01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:28.450
Gahhh!

1003
01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:30.118
Hey!

1004
01:20:30.744 --> 01:20:31.953
Why, you slimy,

1005
01:20:32.037 --> 01:20:34.748
double-crossing, no-good swindler.

1006
01:20:35.373 --> 01:20:39.169
You've got a lot of guts coming here
after what you pulled.

1007
01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:53.600
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1008
01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:56.895
Well, he seems very friendly.

1009
01:20:56.978 --> 01:20:57.979
Yes.

1010
01:20:58.063 --> 01:21:00.065
Very friendly.

1011
01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:01.441
What are you doing here?

1012
01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:03.985
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1013
01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:05.195
What have you done to my ship?

1014
01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:06.279
Your ship?

1015
01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:08.156
Hey, remember,

1016
01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.325
you lost her to me fair and square.

1017
01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:12.285
And how you doin', Chewbacca?

1018
01:21:12.369 --> 01:21:13.370
Gahh!

1019
01:21:13.453 --> 01:21:14.788
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1020
01:21:15.372 --> 01:21:16.873
Gahhh!

1021
01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:20.502
Hello. What have we here?

1022
01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.004
Welcome, I'm Lando Calrissian.

1023
01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:24.881
I'm the administrator of this facility.

1024
01:21:25.257 --> 01:21:26.883
And who might you be?

1025
01:21:26.967 --> 01:21:28.051
Leia.

1026
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.011
Welcome, Leia.

1027
01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:36.226
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

1028
01:21:36.309 --> 01:21:39.437
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1029
01:21:39.521 --> 01:21:40.855
My facilities are at your...

1030
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:42.857
Well, really!

1031
01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.609
What's wrong with the <i>Falcon?</i>

1032
01:21:44.693 --> 01:21:45.694
Hyperdrive.

1033
01:21:45.777 --> 01:21:47.445
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

1034
01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:49.281
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1035
01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:52.284
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1036
01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:56.079
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1037
01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:57.414
Oh, not as well as I'd like.

1038
01:21:57.497 --> 01:21:59.874
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1039
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:04.421
I've had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labour difficulties.

1040
01:22:04.504 --> 01:22:06.172
What's so funny?

1041
01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:08.133
You. Listen to you.

1042
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.010
You sound like a businessman,

1043
01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.386
a responsible leader.

1044
01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:13.805
Who'd have thought that, huh?

1045
01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:16.349
Seeing you brings back a few things.

1046
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:17.892
Yeah.

1047
01:22:18.143 --> 01:22:19.894
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

1048
01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:23.565
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

1049
01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:28.278
Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face.

1050
01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:29.362
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1051
01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:30.739
How rude!

1052
01:22:32.532 --> 01:22:34.617
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

1053
01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:36.119
I wonder if... Hello?

1054
01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:39.789
How interesting.

1055
01:22:39.873 --> 01:22:41.041
Who are you?

1056
01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:43.376
Oh, my! I... I'm terribly sorry.

1057
01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.669
I didn't mean to intrude.

1058
01:22:44.753 --> 01:22:45.879
No, please don't get up.

1059
01:22:52.177 --> 01:22:53.511
Gahhh.

1060
01:23:04.064 --> 01:23:06.566
Luke, you must complete the training.

1061
01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:10.445
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
They're my friends. I got to help them.

1062
01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.697
You must not go.

1063
01:23:12.781 --> 01:23:14.616
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

1064
01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:16.117
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1065
01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:20.497
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

1066
01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:22.957
But I can help them.

1067
01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.376
I feel the Force.

1068
01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:26.044
But you cannot control it.

1069
01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:28.546
This is a dangerous time for you,

1070
01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:32.467
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

1071
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:35.512
Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen.

1072
01:23:36.304 --> 01:23:40.100
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1073
01:23:40.183 --> 01:23:42.352
But I've learned so much since then.

1074
01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:44.896
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1075
01:23:44.979 --> 01:23:46.231
You have my word.

1076
01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:50.151
It is you and your abilities
the Emperor wants.

1077
01:23:50.235 --> 01:23:53.071
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

1078
01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:56.157
That's why I have to go.

1079
01:23:56.491 --> 01:24:01.538
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

1080
01:24:01.913 --> 01:24:03.248
You won't.

1081
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:05.250
Stopped they must be.

1082
01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:07.627
On this all depends.

1083
01:24:08.002 --> 01:24:10.171
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,

1084
01:24:10.255 --> 01:24:12.090
with the Force as his ally,

1085
01:24:12.173 --> 01:24:14.676
will conquer Vader and his Emperor.

1086
01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:17.011
If you end your training now,

1087
01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:21.349
if you choose the quick
and easy path, as Vader did,

1088
01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:24.185
you will become an agent of evil.

1089
01:24:24.269 --> 01:24:25.270
Patience.

1090
01:24:25.979 --> 01:24:27.480
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

1091
01:24:27.856 --> 01:24:31.609
If you honour
what they fight for... yes.

1092
01:24:31.693 --> 01:24:33.403
If you choose to face Vader,

1093
01:24:33.486 --> 01:24:34.779
you will do it alone.

1094
01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:36.739
I cannot interfere.

1095
01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:40.118
I understand.

1096
01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:47.250
R2.

1097
01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:48.793
Fire up the converters.

1098
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.714
Luke!

1099
01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:56.050
Don't give in to hate.

1100
01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:58.720
That leads to the dark side.

1101
01:24:59.012 --> 01:25:00.305
Strong is Vader.

1102
01:25:00.388 --> 01:25:03.308
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1103
01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:05.059
I will.

1104
01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:06.769
And I'll return.

1105
01:25:06.853 --> 01:25:08.438
I promise.

1106
01:25:15.195 --> 01:25:16.446
Told you, I did.

1107
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.281
Reckless is he.

1108
01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:19.449
Now...

1109
01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.618
matters are worse.

1110
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.995
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

1111
01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:26.539
No, there is another.

1112
01:25:59.113 --> 01:26:00.114
The ship's almost finished.

1113
01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:02.367
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1114
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:04.536
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1115
01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:06.621
No one has seen
or knows anything about 3PO.

1116
01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:09.123
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1117
01:26:09.207 --> 01:26:13.253
Relax. I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

1118
01:26:14.003 --> 01:26:16.130
I don't trust Lando.

1119
01:26:16.464 --> 01:26:18.550
Well, I don't trust him either.

1120
01:26:18.633 --> 01:26:21.261
But he is my friend. Besides...

1121
01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:23.221
we'll soon be gone.

1122
01:26:24.514 --> 01:26:26.224
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1123
01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:01.301
Gaahh!

1124
01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:02.427
What happened?

1125
01:27:04.262 --> 01:27:05.471
Where?

1126
01:27:05.555 --> 01:27:06.848
Gahhh!

1127
01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:08.057
Found him in a junk pile?

1128
01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.436
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1129
01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:13.688
Gahhh!

1130
01:27:13.771 --> 01:27:15.523
Lando's got people that can fix him.

1131
01:27:15.607 --> 01:27:16.941
No, thanks.

1132
01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:20.737
I'm sorry, am I interrupting anything?

1133
01:27:21.279 --> 01:27:22.572
Not really.

1134
01:27:26.242 --> 01:27:28.328
You look absolutely beautiful.

1135
01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:31.789
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

1136
01:27:31.873 --> 01:27:33.374
Thank you.

1137
01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:35.084
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1138
01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:37.795
Everyone's invited, of course.

1139
01:27:39.881 --> 01:27:41.382
Having trouble with your droid?

1140
01:27:41.466 --> 01:27:43.134
No, no problem.

1141
01:27:43.217 --> 01:27:44.260
Why?

1142
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:54.854
You see,
since we're a small operation,

1143
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:58.900
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

1144
01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:00.610
So you're part
of the Mining Guild, then?

1145
01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:03.905
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1146
01:28:03.988 --> 01:28:05.907
Which is advantageous for everybody,

1147
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:10.078
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

1148
01:28:10.828 --> 01:28:12.747
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out

1149
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.832
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1150
01:28:14.916 --> 01:28:15.917
It's always been a danger

1151
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.669
that looms like a shadow
over everything we've built.

1152
01:28:17.752 --> 01:28:20.254
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1153
01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:23.591
I've just made a deal that will keep
the Empire out of here forever.

1154
01:28:34.018 --> 01:28:36.896
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

1155
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:46.280
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

1156
01:28:46.823 --> 01:28:48.032
I'm sorry.

1157
01:28:52.453 --> 01:28:53.955
I'm sorry, too.

1158
01:28:55.873 --> 01:28:57.750
Gahhh.

1159
01:29:08.678 --> 01:29:09.846
No, 3PO's with them.

1160
01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:13.015
Just hang on. We're almost there.

1161
01:30:10.948 --> 01:30:12.116
Oh, ah, ooh, ah.

1162
01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:14.118
I'm terribly sorry.

1163
01:30:14.202 --> 01:30:16.370
I didn't mean to intrude.
No, please don't get up.

1164
01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:23.961
No! Secret. Stormtroopers?

1165
01:30:24.045 --> 01:30:26.464
Here? We're in danger!

1166
01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:27.965
I must tell the others.

1167
01:30:28.049 --> 01:30:29.133
Oh, no, I've been shot!

1168
01:30:56.661 --> 01:30:57.995
Lord Vader.

1169
01:30:58.788 --> 01:31:03.584
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.

1170
01:31:03.668 --> 01:31:05.586
He's no good to me dead.

1171
01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:08.589
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1172
01:31:10.842 --> 01:31:13.845
Lord Vader,
what about Leia and the Wookiee?

1173
01:31:13.928 --> 01:31:16.764
They must never again leave this city.

1174
01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:18.432
That was never a condition
of our agreement,

1175
01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:20.017
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1176
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:24.230
Perhaps you think
you're being treated unfairly?

1177
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:27.233
No.

1178
01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:31.612
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

1179
01:31:33.531 --> 01:31:35.908
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1180
01:31:37.118 --> 01:31:39.537
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1181
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.955
Oh!

1182
01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:43.916
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1183
01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:47.795
Oh, oh, oh, that's much better.

1184
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:50.172
Wait! Wait!

1185
01:31:50.256 --> 01:31:52.592
Oh, my! What have you done?

1186
01:31:52.675 --> 01:31:55.803
I'm backwards,
you flea-bitten furball!

1187
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.890
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

1188
01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:14.947
I feel terrible.

1189
01:32:15.031 --> 01:32:16.365
Gahhh.

1190
01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:32.298
Why are they doing this?

1191
01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:37.511
They never even asked me
any questions.

1192
01:32:42.767 --> 01:32:43.935
Lando.

1193
01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:48.731
Get out of here, Lando.

1194
01:32:48.814 --> 01:32:50.191
Shut up and listen!

1195
01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:51.776
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1196
01:32:51.859 --> 01:32:52.985
Over to you?

1197
01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:54.654
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1198
01:32:54.737 --> 01:32:55.738
What about Han?

1199
01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:56.948
Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

1200
01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.866
Vader wants us all dead.

1201
01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:01.911
He doesn't want you at all.
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

1202
01:33:02.703 --> 01:33:04.914
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1203
01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:06.082
And we're the bait!

1204
01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:07.917
He's on his way.

1205
01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:11.045
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

1206
01:33:11.128 --> 01:33:12.838
My friend.

1207
01:33:14.757 --> 01:33:15.841
Stop!

1208
01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.428
I've done all I can.

1209
01:33:20.012 --> 01:33:22.682
I'm sorry I couldn't do better,
but I've got my own problems.

1210
01:33:22.765 --> 01:33:24.016
Yeah.

1211
01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:26.227
You're a real hero.

1212
01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:38.656
You certainly have a way with people.

1213
01:33:42.743 --> 01:33:44.412
Ah... Ah...

1214
01:33:53.421 --> 01:33:55.589
This facility is crude,

1215
01:33:55.673 --> 01:33:58.509
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker

1216
01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:00.970
for his journey to the Emperor.

1217
01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:03.931
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1218
01:34:04.015 --> 01:34:07.518
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

1219
01:34:08.728 --> 01:34:11.897
Lord Vader, we only use
this facility for carbon freezing.

1220
01:34:11.981 --> 01:34:13.649
You put him in there, it might kill him.

1221
01:34:13.733 --> 01:34:16.652
I do not want
the Emperor's prize damaged.

1222
01:34:16.777 --> 01:34:19.613
We will test it on Captain Solo.

1223
01:34:43.846 --> 01:34:45.222
If only you'd attached my legs,

1224
01:34:45.306 --> 01:34:47.266
I wouldn't be in
this ridiculous position.

1225
01:34:47.933 --> 01:34:50.853
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me,

1226
01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:52.855
so don't do anything foolish.

1227
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:07.745
What's going on...

1228
01:35:07.828 --> 01:35:08.996
buddy?

1229
01:35:09.538 --> 01:35:11.999
You're being put into carbon freeze.

1230
01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:15.419
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1231
01:35:15.503 --> 01:35:17.963
The Empire
will compensate you if he dies.

1232
01:35:18.255 --> 01:35:19.381
Put him in.

1233
01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:23.594
No, no, no!

1234
01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.388
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

1235
01:35:27.515 --> 01:35:29.600
Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1236
01:35:29.683 --> 01:35:32.019
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

1237
01:35:32.436 --> 01:35:33.687
This won't help me.

1238
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.648
Hey, save your strength.

1239
01:35:35.731 --> 01:35:37.274
There will be another time.

1240
01:35:38.567 --> 01:35:40.361
The princess...

1241
01:35:40.444 --> 01:35:42.279
You have to take care of her.

1242
01:35:44.448 --> 01:35:46.826
Do you hear me? Huh?

1243
01:36:00.339 --> 01:36:01.715
I love you.

1244
01:36:02.133 --> 01:36:03.425
I know.

1245
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.115
Gahhh!

1246
01:36:32.496 --> 01:36:34.540
What's going on? Turn around!

1247
01:36:34.623 --> 01:36:36.000
Chewbacca, I can't see.

1248
01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:52.683
Gahhh.

1249
01:37:34.475 --> 01:37:37.311
Oh, they've encased him in carbonite.

1250
01:37:37.394 --> 01:37:39.146
He should be quite well protected,

1251
01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:41.148
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1252
01:37:41.232 --> 01:37:43.776
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

1253
01:37:43.859 --> 01:37:45.736
Yes, he's alive.

1254
01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:48.280
And in perfect hibernation.

1255
01:37:48.906 --> 01:37:51.325
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

1256
01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:54.036
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

1257
01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:58.207
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

1258
01:37:58.457 --> 01:38:01.794
Good. See to it that
he finds his way in here.

1259
01:38:06.423 --> 01:38:10.970
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1260
01:38:11.053 --> 01:38:13.180
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1261
01:38:13.264 --> 01:38:15.057
I am altering the deal.

1262
01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.643
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1263
01:39:54.114 --> 01:39:55.282
Gahhh!

1264
01:39:55.366 --> 01:39:58.035
Luke! Luke, don't, it's a trap!

1265
01:39:59.411 --> 01:40:00.537
It's a trap!

1266
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.378
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1267
01:40:51.255 --> 01:40:53.715
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1268
01:41:55.527 --> 01:41:56.904
Well done.

1269
01:41:58.739 --> 01:42:02.784
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet. Move.

1270
01:42:08.582 --> 01:42:10.459
What do you think you're doing?

1271
01:42:10.542 --> 01:42:11.585
We're getting out of here.

1272
01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:13.462
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1273
01:42:13.545 --> 01:42:16.423
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1274
01:42:17.841 --> 01:42:19.134
I had no choice.

1275
01:42:19.218 --> 01:42:20.677
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1276
01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:23.764
Oh, we understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1277
01:42:23.847 --> 01:42:25.516
I'm just trying to help.

1278
01:42:25.599 --> 01:42:27.392
We don't need any of your help.

1279
01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:33.941
What?

1280
01:42:34.024 --> 01:42:35.025
Han...

1281
01:42:35.108 --> 01:42:36.235
It sounds like "Han."

1282
01:42:36.318 --> 01:42:38.820
There's still a chance to save Han...

1283
01:42:39.696 --> 01:42:42.115
at the east...

1284
01:42:42.199 --> 01:42:43.784
platform.

1285
01:42:44.326 --> 01:42:45.327
Chewie.

1286
01:42:47.829 --> 01:42:50.249
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1287
01:42:50.332 --> 01:42:52.125
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1288
01:42:52.584 --> 01:42:54.836
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1289
01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:13.313
R2, R2, where have you been?

1290
01:43:13.397 --> 01:43:15.232
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1291
01:43:16.108 --> 01:43:19.278
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1292
01:43:21.405 --> 01:43:24.283
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1293
01:43:24.366 --> 01:43:25.826
Look what's happened to me.

1294
01:43:38.672 --> 01:43:40.966
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1295
01:43:54.313 --> 01:43:56.607
You have learned much, young one.

1296
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:58.775
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1297
01:44:10.162 --> 01:44:13.540
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1298
01:44:13.957 --> 01:44:16.251
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1299
01:44:16.793 --> 01:44:17.794
No.

1300
01:44:22.341 --> 01:44:23.342
Aaah!

1301
01:44:24.885 --> 01:44:26.428
All too easy.

1302
01:44:31.433 --> 01:44:34.227
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the Emperor thought.

1303
01:44:37.272 --> 01:44:38.815
Impressive.

1304
01:44:40.734 --> 01:44:42.319
Most impressive.

1305
01:44:44.988 --> 01:44:46.698
Aaah!

1306
01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:51.620
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1307
01:44:51.703 --> 01:44:53.747
You have controlled your fear.

1308
01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.209
Now...

1309
01:44:57.417 --> 01:44:59.753
release your anger.

1310
01:44:59.836 --> 01:45:02.547
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1311
01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.810
Oh!

1312
01:47:13.178 --> 01:47:15.430
The security code has been changed.

1313
01:47:15.514 --> 01:47:18.767
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1314
01:47:19.643 --> 01:47:20.769
R2, hurry!

1315
01:47:23.939 --> 01:47:25.774
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.

1316
01:47:26.066 --> 01:47:28.610
<i>Attention. The Empire
has taken control of the city.</i>

1317
01:47:28.693 --> 01:47:32.197
I advise everyone to leave
before more Imperial troops arrive.

1318
01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:39.788
This way.

1319
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:42.415
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1320
01:47:42.499 --> 01:47:45.168
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1321
01:48:06.398 --> 01:48:09.359
Ah! We're not interested in the
hyperdrive on the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

1322
01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:10.443
It's fixed!

1323
01:48:14.322 --> 01:48:16.658
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1324
01:48:26.167 --> 01:48:27.794
I never doubted you for a second.

1325
01:48:27.878 --> 01:48:28.920
Wonderful!

1326
01:48:51.735 --> 01:48:53.820
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1327
01:48:53.904 --> 01:48:56.072
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1328
01:49:01.536 --> 01:49:02.579
Leia!

1329
01:49:03.163 --> 01:49:04.205
Go!

1330
01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:13.173
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1331
01:49:14.341 --> 01:49:15.717
Of course I've looked better.

1332
01:50:09.604 --> 01:50:10.981
You are beaten.

1333
01:50:11.481 --> 01:50:13.149
It is useless to resist.

1334
01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.486
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1335
01:50:27.622 --> 01:50:29.124
Aah!

1336
01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:34.212
There is no escape.

1337
01:50:34.921 --> 01:50:37.215
Don't make me destroy you.

1338
01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.343
Luke,

1339
01:50:40.677 --> 01:50:43.888
you do not yet realise your importance.

1340
01:50:43.972 --> 01:50:46.933
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1341
01:50:47.017 --> 01:50:51.312
Join me,
and I will complete your training.

1342
01:50:51.396 --> 01:50:53.773
With our combined strength,

1343
01:50:53.857 --> 01:50:59.320
we can end this destructive conflict
and bring order to the galaxy.

1344
01:50:59.404 --> 01:51:00.947
I'll never join you!

1345
01:51:01.281 --> 01:51:05.201
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1346
01:51:05.994 --> 01:51:10.206
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1347
01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:12.083
He told me enough!

1348
01:51:14.753 --> 01:51:16.254
He told me you killed him.

1349
01:51:16.337 --> 01:51:17.714
No.

1350
01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:20.050
I am your father.

1351
01:51:24.429 --> 01:51:25.930
No.

1352
01:51:26.681 --> 01:51:28.058
No.

1353
01:51:28.558 --> 01:51:30.185
That's not true.

1354
01:51:31.644 --> 01:51:33.313
That's impossible!

1355
01:51:33.396 --> 01:51:36.816
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1356
01:51:37.984 --> 01:51:40.487
No!

1357
01:51:40.779 --> 01:51:43.156
No!

1358
01:51:44.074 --> 01:51:45.158
Luke.

1359
01:51:45.241 --> 01:51:47.494
You can destroy the Emperor.

1360
01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.621
He has foreseen this.

1361
01:51:49.788 --> 01:51:52.415
It is your destiny.

1362
01:51:52.707 --> 01:51:58.546
Join me, and together we can rule
the galaxy as father and son.

1363
01:52:09.849 --> 01:52:11.226
Come with me.

1364
01:52:11.684 --> 01:52:13.311
It is the only way.

1365
01:52:45.135 --> 01:52:46.219
Ah!

1366
01:53:20.086 --> 01:53:21.337
Ben.

1367
01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:24.090
Ben, please.

1368
01:53:33.766 --> 01:53:34.976
Ben.

1369
01:53:40.231 --> 01:53:41.524
Leia.

1370
01:53:52.118 --> 01:53:53.369
Hear me.

1371
01:53:55.288 --> 01:53:56.581
Leia.

1372
01:53:56.873 --> 01:53:58.291
Luke.

1373
01:54:00.627 --> 01:54:02.295
We've got to go back.

1374
01:54:02.378 --> 01:54:04.339
- What?
- I know where Luke is.

1375
01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:05.548
What about those fighters?

1376
01:54:06.466 --> 01:54:07.884
Chewie, just do it.

1377
01:54:07.967 --> 01:54:09.302
But what about Vader?

1378
01:54:09.385 --> 01:54:10.720
All right, all right, all right!

1379
01:54:18.603 --> 01:54:22.649
Alert my Star Destroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1380
01:54:33.368 --> 01:54:35.328
Look, someone's up there.

1381
01:54:36.913 --> 01:54:37.956
It's Luke.

1382
01:54:38.039 --> 01:54:39.415
Chewie, slow down.

1383
01:54:39.499 --> 01:54:40.917
Slow down. We'll get under him.

1384
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.627
Lando, open the top hatch.

1385
01:54:58.685 --> 01:54:59.936
Okay.

1386
01:55:00.019 --> 01:55:01.145
Easy, Chewie.

1387
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:02.272
Gahrrr.

1388
01:55:22.959 --> 01:55:23.960
Lando?

1389
01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:25.128
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1390
01:55:42.228 --> 01:55:44.397
Oh, Leia.

1391
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:45.982
All right, Chewie, let's go.

1392
01:56:21.601 --> 01:56:22.685
I'll be back.

1393
01:56:29.567 --> 01:56:30.985
Star Destroyer.

1394
01:56:36.032 --> 01:56:38.284
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1395
01:56:38.826 --> 01:56:41.037
If your people
fixed the hyperdrive.

1396
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.373
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1397
01:56:43.456 --> 01:56:44.582
Punch it!

1398
01:56:55.593 --> 01:56:57.053
They told me they fixed it.

1399
01:56:57.804 --> 01:56:59.722
I trusted them to fix it!

1400
01:57:00.098 --> 01:57:01.933
It's not my fault!

1401
01:57:07.814 --> 01:57:10.566
They'll be in range of
our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1402
01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:14.445
Did your men deactivate
the hyperdrive on the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

1403
01:57:14.529 --> 01:57:15.530
Yes, my lord.

1404
01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:20.410
Good. Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for "stun."

1405
01:57:20.493 --> 01:57:23.538
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1406
01:57:24.831 --> 01:57:27.708
Noisy brute.
Why don't we just go into light speed?

1407
01:57:28.126 --> 01:57:29.419
We can't?

1408
01:57:29.710 --> 01:57:32.588
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1409
01:57:35.758 --> 01:57:38.219
The city's central computer told you?

1410
01:57:38.678 --> 01:57:41.597
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1411
01:57:41.681 --> 01:57:42.723
Ouch!

1412
01:57:42.807 --> 01:57:44.767
Pay attention to what you're doing!

1413
01:57:55.778 --> 01:57:56.904
Luke.

1414
01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.573
Father.

1415
01:58:00.158 --> 01:58:02.493
Son, come with me.

1416
01:58:05.288 --> 01:58:06.706
Ben.

1417
01:58:07.707 --> 01:58:09.709
Why didn't you tell me?

1418
01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:17.091
Chewie!

1419
01:58:28.269 --> 01:58:29.520
It's Vader.

1420
01:58:35.318 --> 01:58:38.696
Luke, it is your destiny.

1421
01:58:43.534 --> 01:58:44.744
Ben.

1422
01:58:46.329 --> 01:58:48.164
Why didn't you tell me?

1423
01:58:55.046 --> 01:58:56.881
Alert all commands.

1424
01:58:57.256 --> 01:58:58.841
Ready for the tractor beam.

1425
01:59:01.886 --> 01:59:03.471
R2, come back at once!

1426
01:59:03.554 --> 01:59:05.473
You haven't finished with me yet.

1427
01:59:05.556 --> 01:59:07.350
You don't know
how to fix the hyperdrive.

1428
01:59:07.433 --> 01:59:08.726
Chewbacca can do it.

1429
01:59:08.809 --> 01:59:10.353
I'm standing here in pieces,

1430
01:59:10.436 --> 01:59:12.897
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1431
01:59:16.776 --> 01:59:18.027
You did it!

1432
02:00:15.501 --> 02:00:17.587
Luke, we're ready for take-off.

1433
02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:18.879
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1434
02:00:19.964 --> 02:00:22.174
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter,</i>

1435
02:00:22.258 --> 02:00:23.467
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1436
02:00:23.968 --> 02:00:26.679
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1437
02:00:26.762 --> 02:00:28.806
Princess, we'll find Han.

1438
02:00:29.056 --> 02:00:30.308
I promise.

1439
02:00:30.391 --> 02:00:32.351
Chewie,
I'll be waiting for your signal.

1440
02:00:32.643 --> 02:00:34.437
Take care, you two.

1441
02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:36.397
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1442
02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:37.898
Gahhh.

1443
02:00:37.982 --> 02:00:40.610
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1444
02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:50.661
Ow.
