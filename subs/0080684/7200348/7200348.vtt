3
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.550
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

4
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.552
<i>Loud and clear, kid. What's up?</i>

5
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:40.679
I finished my circle.

6
00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.472
I don't pick up any life readings.

7
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.558
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

8
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.477
<i>Sensors are placed. I'm going back.</i>

9
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.437
Right. I'll see you shortly.

10
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.398
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

11
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.650
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

12
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.488
Steady, girl. What's the matter?

13
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.864
You smell something?

14
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.032
Chewie!

15
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.200
Chewie?

16
00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.286
Chewie!

17
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.249
All right! Don't lose your temper.

18
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:52.959
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

19
00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.273
Solo?

20
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.941
No sign of life out there, General.

21
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.318
The sensors are in place.

22
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.527
You'll know if anything comes around.

23
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.071
Commander Skywalker
reported in yet?

24
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.490
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

25
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.617
With all the meteor activity
in this system,

26
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.452
it's going to be difficult to spot
approaching ships.

27
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.996
General, I got to leave.
I can't stay any more.

28
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:31.372
I'm sorry to hear that.

29
00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.540
Well, there's a price on my head.

30
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.125
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,

31
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.418
I'm a dead man.

32
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.587
A death mark's
not an easy thing to live with.

33
00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:39.925
You're a good fighter, Solo.

34
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.177
I hate to lose you.

35
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.553
Thank you, General.

36
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.980
Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.

37
00:05:53.898 --> 00:05:55.191
That's right.

38
00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.321
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

39
00:06:02.948 --> 00:06:04.158
Han!

40
00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:07.703
Yes, Your Highnessness?

41
00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:09.288
I thought you had decided to stay.

42
00:06:09.371 --> 00:06:12.124
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

43
00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:14.168
Han, we need you!

44
00:06:14.627 --> 00:06:16.045
- "We need"?
- Yes.

45
00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:17.963
Well, what about you need?

46
00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:19.048
I need?

47
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:21.342
I don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:23.219
You probably don't.

49
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.304
And what precisely
am I supposed to know?

50
00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:26.847
Come on!

51
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.141
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

52
00:06:29.225 --> 00:06:31.936
Yes! You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

53
00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:34.688
No! That's not it.

54
00:06:34.772 --> 00:06:36.107
Come on.

55
00:06:36.607 --> 00:06:37.900
A-ha!

56
00:06:37.983 --> 00:06:39.360
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

57
00:06:39.443 --> 00:06:41.237
Am I? Then why are you following me?

58
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.906
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

59
00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:45.032
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee!

60
00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:46.408
I can arrange that.

61
00:06:46.575 --> 00:06:48.577
You could use a good kiss!

62
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:50.913
Don't try to blame me.

63
00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:52.623
I didn't ask you to turn on
the thermal heater.

64
00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:55.668
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess' chamber.

65
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.045
But it's supposed to be freezing.

66
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.839
How we're going to dry out
all her clothes, I really don't know.

67
00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:02.424
Oh, switch off!

68
00:07:02.508 --> 00:07:03.509
Why did you take this apart now?

69
00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:05.427
I'm trying to get us out of here,
and you pull both...

70
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.512
Excuse me, sir.

71
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:07.596
Put them back together now!

72
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.223
Might I have a word with you, please?

73
00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:10.891
- What do you want?
- Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

74
00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:12.560
She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

75
00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:14.520
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

76
00:07:14.603 --> 00:07:16.981
Well, Princess Leia
is wondering about Master Luke.

77
00:07:17.064 --> 00:07:18.691
He hasn't come back yet.
She doesn't know where he is.

78
00:07:18.774 --> 00:07:20.651
- I don't know where he is.
- Nobody knows where he is.

79
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:22.236
What do you mean, nobody knows?

80
00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.238
- Well, uh, you see...
- Deck Officer!

81
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.198
- Deck Officer!
- Excuse me, sir, might I...

82
00:07:26.282 --> 00:07:27.283
Yes, sir?

83
00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:28.784
Do you know
where Commander Skywalker is?

84
00:07:28.868 --> 00:07:29.869
I haven't seen him.

85
00:07:29.952 --> 00:07:31.579
It's possible he came in through
the south entrance.

86
00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:34.123
"It's possible"?
Why don't you go find out?

87
00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:35.291
It's getting dark out there.

88
00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:36.625
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.878
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what's going on?

90
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:40.087
Why not?

91
00:07:40.337 --> 00:07:41.463
Impossible man.

92
00:07:41.547 --> 00:07:43.340
Come along, R2,
let's find Princess Leia.

93
00:07:43.424 --> 00:07:46.844
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

94
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.689
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

95
00:07:58.772 --> 00:07:59.982
He might have forgotten to check in.

96
00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:01.150
Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

97
00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:03.569
Uh, not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

98
00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:04.737
We'll have to go out on tauntauns.

99
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.572
Sir, the temperature's
dropping too rapidly.

100
00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:08.115
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

101
00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:15.789
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

102
00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:17.875
Then I'll see you in hell. Hyah!

103
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:37.723
You must come along now, R2.

104
00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:39.850
There's really nothing more we can do.

105
00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.144
And my joints are freezing up.

106
00:10:43.312 --> 00:10:44.730
Don't say things like that!

107
00:10:44.813 --> 00:10:46.190
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

108
00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:49.777
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

109
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.737
Stupid little short circuit.

110
00:10:52.154 --> 00:10:53.781
He'll be quite all right.

111
00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:53.465
Sir, all the patrols are in.

112
00:11:53.549 --> 00:11:54.550
Still no...

113
00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:58.262
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

114
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:02.099
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,

115
00:12:02.516 --> 00:12:04.810
although he does admit
that his own range

116
00:12:04.893 --> 00:12:06.353
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

117
00:12:06.437 --> 00:12:08.272
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

118
00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:10.774
The shield doors must be closed.

119
00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:13.360
Close the doors.

120
00:12:13.444 --> 00:12:14.445
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:20.659
R2 says the chances of survival
are 725 to 1.

122
00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:35.883
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

123
00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:40.179
from time to time.

124
00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:42.055
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

125
00:12:46.018 --> 00:12:47.102
Don't worry about Master Luke.

126
00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:48.604
I'm sure he'll be all right.

127
00:12:48.687 --> 00:12:51.064
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

128
00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:08.624
<i>Luke.</i>

129
00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:12.252
Luke.

130
00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:21.261
Ben?

131
00:13:21.345 --> 00:13:24.056
You will go to the Dagobah system.

132
00:13:24.598 --> 00:13:25.974
Dagobah system?

133
00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:29.144
There you will learn from Yoda,

134
00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:32.814
the Jedi master who instructed me.

135
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:35.484
Ben!

136
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:37.152
Ben.

137
00:13:41.907 --> 00:13:43.242
Luke!

138
00:13:43.617 --> 00:13:44.701
Luke!

139
00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:53.752
Don't do this, Luke.

140
00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:55.754
Come on, give me a sign here.

141
00:14:18.902 --> 00:14:20.696
Not much time.

142
00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:21.947
Ben.

143
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.407
Ben.

144
00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.705
Hang on, kid.

145
00:14:30.872 --> 00:14:33.792
- Dagobah system. Dagobah.
- Whew!

146
00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.627
This may smell bad, kid...

147
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:38.463
Yoda.

148
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.632
...but it'll keep you warm...

149
00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:43.135
till I get the shelter up.

150
00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:45.512
Ben... Dagobah...

151
00:14:45.596 --> 00:14:47.306
Ahhh!

152
00:14:47.848 --> 00:14:52.603
Ah! I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

153
00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:39.274
Echo Base, I've got something.

154
00:15:39.358 --> 00:15:40.859
Not much, but it could be a life form.

155
00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:47.532
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

156
00:15:47.783 --> 00:15:49.451
This is Rogue Two.

157
00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:51.995
This is Rogue Two.

158
00:15:52.454 --> 00:15:55.582
Captain Solo, do you copy?

159
00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:04.925
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?

160
00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:06.968
This is Rogue Two.

161
00:16:07.052 --> 00:16:09.846
<i>Good morning.
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

162
00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:13.517
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

163
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.893
I've found them.

164
00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:16.645
Repeat, I've found them.

165
00:16:46.967 --> 00:16:50.095
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

166
00:16:50.178 --> 00:16:51.388
Thanks, 3PO.

167
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:53.181
R2 expresses his relief also.

168
00:16:53.306 --> 00:16:56.101
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

169
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.855
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

170
00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:01.481
Thanks to you.

171
00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:04.025
That's two you owe me, junior.

172
00:17:04.317 --> 00:17:05.318
Well, Your Worship,

173
00:17:05.402 --> 00:17:08.280
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

174
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.449
I had nothing to do with it.

175
00:17:10.574 --> 00:17:13.577
General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous
for any ships to leave the system

176
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.911
until we've activated the energy field.

177
00:17:15.454 --> 00:17:16.621
That's a good story.

178
00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.248
I think you just can't bear to let

179
00:17:18.331 --> 00:17:20.667
a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

180
00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:24.337
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

181
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:29.509
Laugh it up, fuzzball,

182
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.888
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

183
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:35.432
She expressed her true feelings for me.

184
00:17:35.515 --> 00:17:36.767
My...

185
00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:39.936
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted,

186
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:42.689
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

187
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.650
Who's scruffy-looking?

188
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:50.280
I must have hit
pretty close to the mark

189
00:17:50.363 --> 00:17:52.365
to get her all riled up like that,
huh, kid?

190
00:17:55.994 --> 00:17:58.663
Well, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

191
00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:07.798
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

192
00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:13.929
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command centre.</i>

193
00:18:14.012 --> 00:18:15.013
Take it easy.

194
00:18:15.764 --> 00:18:17.015
Excuse us, please.

195
00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:22.604
Princess, we have a visitor.

196
00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:26.399
Picked up something
outside the base's Zone 12 moving east.

197
00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:27.484
It's metal.

198
00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:28.819
Then it couldn't be
one of those creatures.

199
00:18:28.902 --> 00:18:30.487
Could be a speeder, one of ours.

200
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.780
No.

201
00:18:31.863 --> 00:18:32.906
Wait.

202
00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:35.700
There's something
very weak coming through.

203
00:18:38.954 --> 00:18:42.040
Sir, I'm fluent in six million
forms of communication.

204
00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:43.708
This signal is not used by the Alliance.

205
00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:45.293
It could be an Imperial code.

206
00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:52.092
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.

207
00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:53.593
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

208
00:18:53.677 --> 00:18:55.929
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

209
00:19:32.716 --> 00:19:33.842
<i>I'm afraid there's not much left.</i>

210
00:19:33.925 --> 00:19:35.594
- What was it?
<i>- Droid of some kind.</i>

211
00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:37.971
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.
Must've had a self-destruct.</i>

212
00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:40.056
An Imperial probe droid.

213
00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:43.018
<i>It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.</i>

214
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.186
We'd better start the evacuation.

215
00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:31.691
Admiral.

216
00:20:31.942 --> 00:20:33.068
Yes, Captain?

217
00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:35.570
I think we've got something, sir.

218
00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:39.240
The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,

219
00:20:39.324 --> 00:20:40.700
but it's the best lead we've had.

220
00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:43.787
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

221
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.955
I want proof, not leads.

222
00:20:45.038 --> 00:20:46.915
The visuals indicate life readings.

223
00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:49.250
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

224
00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:52.170
But, sir, the Hoth system
is supposed to be devoid of humans.

225
00:20:52.253 --> 00:20:53.630
You've found something?

226
00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:54.839
Yes, my lord.

227
00:20:57.217 --> 00:20:59.636
That's it. The Rebels are there.

228
00:21:00.303 --> 00:21:04.265
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

229
00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:05.350
It could be smugglers...

230
00:21:05.433 --> 00:21:06.977
That is the system.

231
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.604
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

232
00:21:09.854 --> 00:21:12.232
Set your course for the Hoth system.

233
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.609
General Veers, prepare your men.

234
00:21:15.193 --> 00:21:16.444
Admiral.

235
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:25.745
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

236
00:21:25.829 --> 00:21:27.288
As soon as each transport is loaded,

237
00:21:27.372 --> 00:21:29.624
evacuation control will give clearance
for immediate launch.

238
00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:30.709
Right, sir.

239
00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:35.880
All right! That's it.

240
00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:37.007
Try it.

241
00:21:38.842 --> 00:21:41.928
Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off!

242
00:21:42.012 --> 00:21:44.139
Turn it off!

243
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:47.934
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

244
00:21:48.018 --> 00:21:49.019
Forget the heavy equipment.

245
00:21:49.102 --> 00:21:51.396
There's plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports.

246
00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:52.480
Take care, sir.

247
00:21:52.564 --> 00:21:53.565
Thanks.

248
00:21:56.943 --> 00:21:59.821
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

249
00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.744
Okay, okay!

250
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:08.455
Hi, kid.

251
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:11.041
There's got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

252
00:22:11.332 --> 00:22:12.709
Wait a second.

253
00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:15.086
You all right?

254
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.421
Yeah.

255
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:24.137
Be careful.

256
00:22:24.888 --> 00:22:26.097
You, too.

257
00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:35.023
General, there's a fleet
of Star Destroyers

258
00:22:35.106 --> 00:22:36.775
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

259
00:22:37.317 --> 00:22:39.903
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

260
00:22:40.236 --> 00:22:43.490
We gotta hold them
till all transports are away.

261
00:22:43.615 --> 00:22:44.991
Prepare for ground assault.

262
00:22:59.464 --> 00:23:01.299
What is it, General?

263
00:23:01.382 --> 00:23:03.134
My lord, the fleet
has moved out of light speed.

264
00:23:03.218 --> 00:23:05.261
ComScan has detected
an energy field

265
00:23:05.345 --> 00:23:07.972
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

266
00:23:08.056 --> 00:23:10.475
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

267
00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.144
The Rebels are alerted to our presence.

268
00:23:13.228 --> 00:23:16.397
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

269
00:23:16.481 --> 00:23:18.650
He... He felt surprise was wiser.

270
00:23:18.733 --> 00:23:21.069
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

271
00:23:21.152 --> 00:23:24.405
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

272
00:23:24.489 --> 00:23:26.074
Yes, my lord.

273
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:34.582
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

274
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:36.835
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,
and we're preparing to...</i>

275
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.257
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

276
00:23:42.674 --> 00:23:43.842
Captain Piett.

277
00:23:44.008 --> 00:23:45.510
<i>Yes, my lord?</i>

278
00:23:45.593 --> 00:23:48.596
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field

279
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.683
and deploy the fleet
so that nothing gets off the system.

280
00:23:51.766 --> 00:23:54.936
You are in command now, Admiral Piett.

281
00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:56.354
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

282
00:23:58.106 --> 00:24:01.359
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

283
00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:04.279
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

284
00:24:04.362 --> 00:24:06.447
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

285
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.325
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time,

286
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:11.953
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

287
00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:14.372
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

288
00:24:14.455 --> 00:24:16.457
The ion cannon
will fire several shots

289
00:24:16.541 --> 00:24:19.544
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

290
00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:22.046
When you've gotten past
the energy shield,

291
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.215
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

292
00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:25.967
- Understood?
- Yeah.

293
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.385
Good luck.

294
00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:29.387
Okay. Everybody to your stations.

295
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.555
Let's go.

296
00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:51.159
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

297
00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:52.619
Prepare to open shield.

298
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.960
Sir, Rebel ships
are coming into our sector.

299
00:25:01.044 --> 00:25:03.129
Good. Our first catch of the day.

300
00:25:04.964 --> 00:25:06.966
Stand by, ion control.

301
00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.260
Fire.

302
00:25:24.442 --> 00:25:27.487
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

303
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.157
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

304
00:25:36.537 --> 00:25:38.414
Feeling all right, sir?

305
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.500
Just like new, Dak. How about you?

306
00:25:40.708 --> 00:25:43.753
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

307
00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:46.005
I know what you mean.

308
00:26:04.357 --> 00:26:05.483
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

309
00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:07.360
<i>We've spotted Imperial walkers.</i>

310
00:26:07.443 --> 00:26:09.862
<i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>

311
00:26:32.343 --> 00:26:34.637
Echo Station Five-Seven.
We're on our way.

312
00:26:40.143 --> 00:26:42.145
All right, boys, keep tight now.

313
00:26:42.228 --> 00:26:44.355
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

314
00:26:44.439 --> 00:26:46.024
Steady, Dak.

315
00:26:46.107 --> 00:26:47.984
Attack pattern Delta. Go now.

316
00:26:51.487 --> 00:26:53.239
All right. I'm coming in.

317
00:26:57.952 --> 00:26:59.287
Hobbie, you still with me?

318
00:27:21.851 --> 00:27:23.853
That armour's too strong for blasters.

319
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.399
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

320
00:27:28.483 --> 00:27:30.651
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

321
00:27:32.862 --> 00:27:34.322
All right. Stand by, Dak.

322
00:27:34.405 --> 00:27:37.283
Oh, Luke,
we've got a malfunction in fire control.

323
00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:39.327
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

324
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.121
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.

325
00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:44.332
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

326
00:27:46.542 --> 00:27:47.543
Ah!

327
00:27:49.629 --> 00:27:50.630
Dak?

328
00:27:50.713 --> 00:27:51.714
Dak!

329
00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:17.657
Yes, Lord Vader,
I've reached the main power generators.

330
00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.325
The shield will be down in moments.

331
00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:20.827
You may start your landing.

332
00:28:25.998 --> 00:28:27.166
Rogue Three.

333
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.376
Copy, Rogue Leader.

334
00:28:28.459 --> 00:28:30.378
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.</i>

335
00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:31.671
<i>You'll have to make this shot.</i>

336
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:33.548
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

337
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:35.925
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

338
00:28:37.301 --> 00:28:39.303
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

339
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.434
Steady, Rogue Two.

340
00:28:44.517 --> 00:28:45.601
Activate harpoon.

341
00:28:48.563 --> 00:28:50.231
Good shot, Janson.

342
00:28:56.195 --> 00:28:58.489
- One more pass.
- Coming around, once more.

343
00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.330
Cable out. Let her go!

344
00:29:06.414 --> 00:29:08.291
Detach cable.

345
00:29:08.374 --> 00:29:09.500
Cable detached.

346
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:19.260
Come on.

347
00:29:26.142 --> 00:29:27.518
Hah! That got him!

348
00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:29.145
I see it, Wedge. Good work.

349
00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:32.064
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

350
00:29:32.148 --> 00:29:34.400
It's risky,
but we can't hold out much longer.

351
00:29:34.484 --> 00:29:36.736
We have no choice.

352
00:29:36.819 --> 00:29:37.820
Launch patrol.

353
00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:39.530
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

354
00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:41.449
Gahhh!

355
00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:44.076
No, no! No.

356
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.078
This one goes there.

357
00:29:46.162 --> 00:29:48.289
That one goes there, right?

358
00:29:48.372 --> 00:29:51.918
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

359
00:29:53.419 --> 00:29:55.671
And do take good care of yourself.

360
00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:01.219
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

361
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:27.119
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

362
00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:29.372
Prepare to target the main generator.

363
00:30:33.376 --> 00:30:34.377
Rogue Two, are you all right?

364
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.796
Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

365
00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:38.839
Well, set harpoon. I'll cover for you.

366
00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:41.717
Coming around.

367
00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:44.637
Watch that cross fire, boys.

368
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.597
Set for position three.

369
00:30:46.847 --> 00:30:48.140
Steady.

370
00:30:48.224 --> 00:30:49.433
Stay tight and low.

371
00:30:49.517 --> 00:30:50.643
This is it!

372
00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:52.144
Aah!

373
00:30:56.232 --> 00:30:57.733
Hobbie!

374
00:30:57.817 --> 00:30:59.443
I've been hit!

375
00:31:41.694 --> 00:31:42.862
You all right?

376
00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.864
Why are you still here?

377
00:31:44.947 --> 00:31:46.532
Heard the command centre
had been hit.

378
00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:47.867
You've got your clearance to leave.

379
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.827
Don't worry. I'll leave.

380
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.662
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

381
00:31:51.746 --> 00:31:53.372
Your Highness,
we must take this last transport.

382
00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:54.457
It's our only hope.

383
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.835
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the
south slope to protect the fighters.

384
00:31:57.918 --> 00:31:59.128
Ah!

385
00:31:59.545 --> 00:32:01.505
<i>Imperial troops have entered the base.</i>

386
00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:02.882
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

387
00:32:02.965 --> 00:32:04.592
Come on. That's it.

388
00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:07.219
Give the evacuation code signal.

389
00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.973
And get to your transports!

390
00:32:11.223 --> 00:32:12.975
Oh! Wait for me!

391
00:32:13.225 --> 00:32:16.646
Begin retreat! Fall back!

392
00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:16.956
Distance to power generators?

393
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.332
<i>17.28.</i>

394
00:33:27.758 --> 00:33:29.719
Target. Maximum firepower.

395
00:33:55.828 --> 00:33:58.706
Transport, this is Solo.
Better take off. I can't get to you.

396
00:33:58.789 --> 00:34:00.666
I'll get her out on the <i>Falcon.</i>
Come on.

397
00:34:01.917 --> 00:34:04.003
B-B-But where are you going?

398
00:34:04.086 --> 00:34:05.212
Come back!

399
00:34:23.022 --> 00:34:24.023
Wait!

400
00:34:24.106 --> 00:34:26.692
Wait for me! Wait! Stop!

401
00:34:27.401 --> 00:34:29.028
- How typical.
- Come on.

402
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.908
Hurry up, goldenrod.

403
00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:35.659
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

404
00:34:35.743 --> 00:34:37.077
Wait! Wait!

405
00:34:55.763 --> 00:34:56.764
How's this?

406
00:34:57.264 --> 00:34:58.891
Would it help if I got out and pushed?

407
00:34:58.974 --> 00:35:00.142
Captain Solo! Captain Solo!

408
00:35:00.226 --> 00:35:01.227
It might.

409
00:35:02.603 --> 00:35:05.147
Sir, might I suggest that you...

410
00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:07.066
It can wait.

411
00:35:11.153 --> 00:35:13.572
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

412
00:35:13.656 --> 00:35:15.991
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

413
00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.544
Come on! Come on!

414
00:35:26.627 --> 00:35:29.171
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

415
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:32.925
See?

416
00:35:33.008 --> 00:35:35.427
Someday you're gonna be wrong,
and I just hope I'm there to see it.

417
00:35:37.972 --> 00:35:39.139
Punch it!

418
00:35:56.949 --> 00:35:58.367
R2!

419
00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.911
Get her ready for take-off.

420
00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:06.500
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

421
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.047
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

422
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.895
There's nothing wrong, R2.

423
00:36:26.478 --> 00:36:28.022
I'm just setting a new course.

424
00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:32.860
We're not gonna regroup with the others.

425
00:36:34.028 --> 00:36:35.738
We're going to the Dagobah system.

426
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.491
Yes, R2?

427
00:36:42.036 --> 00:36:43.078
That's all right.

428
00:36:43.162 --> 00:36:45.205
I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

429
00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:03.265
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

430
00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:04.600
Saw what?

431
00:37:04.683 --> 00:37:06.852
Star Destroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

432
00:37:06.936 --> 00:37:08.479
Sir! Sir! Might I suggest...

433
00:37:08.562 --> 00:37:09.980
Shut him up or shut him down!

434
00:37:11.607 --> 00:37:13.567
Check the deflector shield.

435
00:37:14.526 --> 00:37:15.569
Great.

436
00:37:15.653 --> 00:37:17.446
Well, we can still outmanoeuvre them.

437
00:37:21.951 --> 00:37:23.869
Take evasive action!

438
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:37.216
Prepare to make the jump
to light speed.

439
00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:38.300
But, sir!

440
00:37:38.759 --> 00:37:40.386
They're getting closer.

441
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.097
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

442
00:37:46.308 --> 00:37:47.643
Watch what?

443
00:37:49.645 --> 00:37:50.688
I think we're in trouble.

444
00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:52.564
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier

445
00:37:52.648 --> 00:37:54.316
the hyperdrive motivator
has been damaged.

446
00:37:54.566 --> 00:37:56.193
It's impossible to go to light speed.

447
00:37:56.276 --> 00:37:57.403
We're in trouble.

448
00:38:02.116 --> 00:38:03.325
Horizontal boosters!

449
00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:05.577
Gahhh!

450
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:07.705
Alluvial dampers.

451
00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:11.000
Ow! That's not it.

452
00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:12.543
Bring me the hydrospanner!

453
00:38:16.255 --> 00:38:18.340
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

454
00:38:20.843 --> 00:38:22.011
Ow!

455
00:38:22.094 --> 00:38:23.178
Chewie!

456
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:28.934
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

457
00:38:29.018 --> 00:38:30.644
Han, get up here!

458
00:38:32.146 --> 00:38:33.355
Come on, Chewie!

459
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:35.607
Asteroids.

460
00:38:35.983 --> 00:38:37.151
Oh, no.

461
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:40.612
Chewie, set two-seven-one.

462
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.031
What are you doing?

463
00:38:43.157 --> 00:38:45.784
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

464
00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:47.703
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

465
00:38:51.123 --> 00:38:52.791
You don't have to do this to impress me.

466
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:55.127
Sir, the possibility
of successfully navigating

467
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.713
an asteroid field
is approximately 3,720 to 1.

468
00:38:57.796 --> 00:38:59.381
Never tell me the odds!

469
00:39:21.737 --> 00:39:24.073
Look out!

470
00:39:27.242 --> 00:39:29.328
You said you wanted
to be around when I made a mistake.

471
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:32.247
- This could be it, sweetheart.
- I take it back.

472
00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:35.334
We're going to get pulverised
if we stay out here much longer.

473
00:39:35.417 --> 00:39:37.878
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverised?

474
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:39.338
I'm going in closer
to one of the big ones.

475
00:39:39.463 --> 00:39:41.048
- Closer?
- Closer?

476
00:39:41.131 --> 00:39:42.174
Gahhh!

477
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:10.285
Oh, this is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

478
00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:12.371
There. That looks pretty good.

479
00:40:12.663 --> 00:40:14.123
What looks pretty good?

480
00:40:14.206 --> 00:40:16.291
Yeah, that'll do nicely.

481
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.128
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

482
00:40:29.888 --> 00:40:32.224
I hope you know what you're doing.

483
00:40:32.307 --> 00:40:33.642
Yeah. Me, too.

484
00:40:42.234 --> 00:40:44.736
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

485
00:40:47.114 --> 00:40:49.283
No, I'm not gonna change my mind
about this.

486
00:40:50.075 --> 00:40:52.828
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

487
00:40:52.911 --> 00:40:55.372
Massive life form readings, though.

488
00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:58.083
There's something alive down there.

489
00:40:59.793 --> 00:41:02.379
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

490
00:41:09.845 --> 00:41:11.138
I know! I know!

491
00:41:11.805 --> 00:41:13.849
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

492
00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:16.101
Just hang on.

493
00:41:16.185 --> 00:41:18.061
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

494
00:42:11.907 --> 00:42:14.451
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

495
00:42:19.248 --> 00:42:20.374
R2?

496
00:42:21.083 --> 00:42:22.084
R2!

497
00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:25.545
Where are you?

498
00:42:28.882 --> 00:42:30.300
R2!

499
00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.059
You be more careful.

500
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.856
R2, that way.

501
00:43:12.718 --> 00:43:14.011
R2!

502
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.831
Oh, no.

503
00:43:44.166 --> 00:43:45.250
Are you all right?

504
00:43:45.334 --> 00:43:47.669
Come on.

505
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:52.257
You were lucky to get out of there.

506
00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:54.301
Anything broken?

507
00:43:58.055 --> 00:44:00.599
If you're saying coming here
was a bad idea,

508
00:44:00.682 --> 00:44:02.225
I'm beginning to agree with you.

509
00:44:03.393 --> 00:44:05.479
R2, what are we doing here?

510
00:44:06.063 --> 00:44:10.776
It's like...
something out of a dream or...

511
00:44:11.526 --> 00:44:13.153
I don't know.

512
00:44:13.528 --> 00:44:15.572
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

513
00:44:48.188 --> 00:44:49.272
Yes, Admiral?

514
00:44:49.815 --> 00:44:52.067
Our ships have sighted
the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord,

515
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.820
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

516
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:57.364
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.

517
00:44:57.781 --> 00:45:00.659
I want that ship, not excuses.

518
00:45:01.034 --> 00:45:02.285
Yes, lord.

519
00:45:07.707 --> 00:45:10.752
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

520
00:45:10.836 --> 00:45:12.671
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,

521
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:14.840
but does that include
shutting me down, too?

522
00:45:14.923 --> 00:45:17.175
No. I need you to talk to the <i>Falcon.</i>

523
00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:19.094
Find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

524
00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:30.564
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

525
00:45:30.939 --> 00:45:32.732
Not entirely stable?

526
00:45:32.816 --> 00:45:34.776
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

527
00:45:35.026 --> 00:45:38.363
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

528
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.366
Sometimes I just don't understand
human behaviour.

529
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.785
After all, I'm only trying to do my job.

530
00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:50.125
- Let go.
- Shh!

531
00:45:51.793 --> 00:45:53.211
Let go, please.

532
00:45:53.295 --> 00:45:54.546
Don't get excited.

533
00:45:54.629 --> 00:45:57.757
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

534
00:45:58.508 --> 00:46:00.051
Sorry, sweetheart.

535
00:46:00.135 --> 00:46:02.095
I haven't got time for anything else.

536
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.131
What?

537
00:46:38.215 --> 00:46:40.050
Ready for some power?

538
00:46:40.133 --> 00:46:41.176
Okay.

539
00:46:44.387 --> 00:46:45.722
Let's see now.

540
00:46:45.805 --> 00:46:47.599
Put that in there.

541
00:46:48.016 --> 00:46:49.184
There you go.

542
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:53.772
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...

543
00:46:54.564 --> 00:46:56.149
if he even exists.

544
00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:05.492
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

545
00:47:07.035 --> 00:47:08.912
This place gives me the creeps.

546
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:13.833
Still...

547
00:47:15.669 --> 00:47:17.546
there's something familiar
about this place.

548
00:47:19.714 --> 00:47:21.258
I don't know.

549
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:22.425
I feel like...

550
00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:23.927
Feel like what?

551
00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:26.471
Like we're being watched!

552
00:47:26.555 --> 00:47:29.474
Away put your weapon!
I mean you no harm.

553
00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:33.520
I am wondering... why are you here?

554
00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:36.606
I'm looking for someone.

555
00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.149
Looking?

556
00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:41.611
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmm?

557
00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:43.697
Right.

558
00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:47.158
Help you I can. Yes, mmm.

559
00:47:47.826 --> 00:47:49.244
I don't think so.

560
00:47:50.036 --> 00:47:51.746
I'm looking for a great warrior.

561
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.039
Ah!

562
00:47:53.582 --> 00:47:55.417
A great warrior.

563
00:47:57.919 --> 00:47:59.838
Wars not make one great.

564
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.181
Put that down.

565
00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.767
Hey! That's my dinner!

566
00:48:15.437 --> 00:48:18.690
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

567
00:48:18.773 --> 00:48:20.859
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

568
00:48:20.942 --> 00:48:22.694
And if we could get our ship out,
we would.

569
00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:23.820
But we can't, so why don't you...

570
00:48:23.903 --> 00:48:25.822
Cannot get your ship out. Hee hee hee!

571
00:48:25.905 --> 00:48:27.365
Hey, get out of there!

572
00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:28.700
Ah!

573
00:48:28.783 --> 00:48:30.827
No! Ooh!

574
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.621
Hey, you could have broken this.

575
00:48:34.497 --> 00:48:35.498
Don't do that.

576
00:48:37.292 --> 00:48:38.710
Oh!

577
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.802
You're making a mess.

578
00:48:49.804 --> 00:48:51.681
Hey, give me that!

579
00:48:51.765 --> 00:48:54.392
Mine, or I will help you not.

580
00:48:54.476 --> 00:48:56.311
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

581
00:48:56.394 --> 00:48:58.396
I'm gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

582
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.315
Mudhole? Slimy?

583
00:49:00.398 --> 00:49:01.733
My home this is.

584
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.694
Wha...

585
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.863
R2, let him have it.

586
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.284
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

587
00:49:11.368 --> 00:49:12.452
R2!

588
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:17.207
Now, will you move along, little fellow?

589
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.750
We've got a lot of work to do.

590
00:49:18.833 --> 00:49:20.418
No! No, no!

591
00:49:20.502 --> 00:49:23.880
Stay and help you I will...
find your friend.

592
00:49:24.464 --> 00:49:27.676
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

593
00:49:28.051 --> 00:49:31.930
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

594
00:49:32.013 --> 00:49:33.640
You seek Yoda.

595
00:49:33.723 --> 00:49:34.849
You know him?

596
00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:38.436
Mmm. Take you to him I will.

597
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.233
Yes, yes,
but now we must eat. Come.

598
00:49:43.942 --> 00:49:45.443
Good food. Come.

599
00:49:55.412 --> 00:49:57.288
Come, come.

600
00:49:59.082 --> 00:50:02.961
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

601
00:50:16.558 --> 00:50:19.310
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

602
00:50:19.394 --> 00:50:22.439
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate,

603
00:50:22.522 --> 00:50:24.315
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

604
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:26.067
I believe, sir, it says
that the power coupling

605
00:50:26.151 --> 00:50:27.819
on the negative axis has been polarised.

606
00:50:27.902 --> 00:50:30.447
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

607
00:50:31.072 --> 00:50:33.742
Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

608
00:50:34.659 --> 00:50:36.453
Here! And, Chewie...

609
00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:40.915
I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

610
00:51:03.438 --> 00:51:06.608
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

611
00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:08.943
Would you please stop calling me that?

612
00:51:09.027 --> 00:51:11.112
Sure, Leia.

613
00:51:11.321 --> 00:51:13.323
You make it so difficult sometimes.

614
00:51:13.406 --> 00:51:15.366
I do. I really do.

615
00:51:15.533 --> 00:51:17.994
You could be a little nicer, though.

616
00:51:18.077 --> 00:51:20.997
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

617
00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:25.418
Occasionally... maybe...

618
00:51:25.502 --> 00:51:27.962
when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.

619
00:51:28.046 --> 00:51:29.881
Scoundrel?

620
00:51:29.964 --> 00:51:31.591
Scoundrel?

621
00:51:33.718 --> 00:51:35.386
I like the sound of that.

622
00:51:36.387 --> 00:51:37.388
Stop that.

623
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.057
Stop what?

624
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.392
Stop that. My hands are dirty.

625
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:43.853
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

626
00:51:43.937 --> 00:51:45.063
Afraid?

627
00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:46.856
You're trembling.

628
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.650
I'm not trembling.

629
00:51:49.984 --> 00:51:52.320
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

630
00:51:53.154 --> 00:51:55.406
There aren't enough scoundrels
in your life.

631
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.242
I happen to like nice men.

632
00:51:57.909 --> 00:51:58.910
I'm a nice man.

633
00:51:59.118 --> 00:52:00.453
No, you're not. You're...

634
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:07.168
Sir, sir! I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

635
00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:10.755
Thank you.

636
00:52:10.839 --> 00:52:12.090
Thank you very much.

637
00:52:12.173 --> 00:52:14.008
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

638
00:52:20.056 --> 00:52:23.434
<i>And that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

639
00:52:23.518 --> 00:52:24.936
<i>Considering the amount of damage
we've sustained,</i>

640
00:52:25.019 --> 00:52:26.437
<i>they must have been destroyed.</i>

641
00:52:26.521 --> 00:52:29.023
No, Captain. They're alive.

642
00:52:29.607 --> 00:52:34.195
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

643
00:52:38.116 --> 00:52:39.576
Lord Vader.

644
00:52:40.368 --> 00:52:41.578
Yes, Admiral. What is it?

645
00:52:42.161 --> 00:52:44.080
The Emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

646
00:52:44.163 --> 00:52:46.666
Move the ship out of the asteroid field

647
00:52:46.749 --> 00:52:49.002
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

648
00:52:49.168 --> 00:52:50.587
Yes, my lord.

649
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.981
What is thy bidding, my master?

650
00:53:11.024 --> 00:53:15.278
<i>There is a great disturbance
in the Force.</i>

651
00:53:16.154 --> 00:53:17.697
I have felt it.

652
00:53:18.573 --> 00:53:21.034
<i>We have a new enemy,</i>

653
00:53:21.242 --> 00:53:25.246
<i>the young Rebel
who destroyed the Death Star.</i>

654
00:53:25.955 --> 00:53:32.921
<i>I have no doubt this boy
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

655
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:35.506
How is that possible?

656
00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:39.010
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

657
00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:41.721
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

658
00:53:42.513 --> 00:53:44.891
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

659
00:53:44.974 --> 00:53:47.101
He's just a boy.

660
00:53:47.185 --> 00:53:49.729
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

661
00:53:50.021 --> 00:53:53.775
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

662
00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:59.572
<i>The son of Skywalker
must not become a Jedi.</i>

663
00:53:59.948 --> 00:54:01.991
If he could be turned,

664
00:54:02.075 --> 00:54:04.953
he would become a powerful ally.

665
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.956
<i>Yes.</i>

666
00:54:08.581 --> 00:54:12.126
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

667
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.213
<i>Can it be done?</i>

668
00:54:15.296 --> 00:54:18.675
He will join us or die, master.

669
00:54:35.942 --> 00:54:37.193
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.

670
00:54:37.276 --> 00:54:39.654
I just don't understand
why we can't see Yoda now.

671
00:54:39.737 --> 00:54:40.738
Patience!

672
00:54:40.822 --> 00:54:43.408
For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

673
00:54:43.491 --> 00:54:44.909
Hmm?

674
00:54:46.786 --> 00:54:48.997
Eat, eat.

675
00:54:49.872 --> 00:54:50.957
Hot!

676
00:54:58.798 --> 00:55:00.842
Good food! Mmm, good, hmm?

677
00:55:00.925 --> 00:55:03.970
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

678
00:55:04.053 --> 00:55:05.847
Not far. Yoda not far.

679
00:55:06.347 --> 00:55:08.975
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

680
00:55:11.519 --> 00:55:12.979
Root leaf.

681
00:55:13.062 --> 00:55:14.564
I cook.

682
00:55:15.982 --> 00:55:19.569
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?

683
00:55:19.652 --> 00:55:21.279
Mostly because of my father, I guess.

684
00:55:21.362 --> 00:55:23.448
Ah, father.

685
00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:25.116
Powerful Jedi was he.

686
00:55:25.199 --> 00:55:28.244
Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.

687
00:55:28.327 --> 00:55:29.412
Oh, come on.

688
00:55:29.495 --> 00:55:30.621
How could you know my father?

689
00:55:30.705 --> 00:55:32.290
You don't even know who I am.

690
00:55:32.373 --> 00:55:35.209
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

691
00:55:37.253 --> 00:55:39.130
I cannot teach him.

692
00:55:39.797 --> 00:55:41.758
The boy has no patience.

693
00:55:42.008 --> 00:55:44.302
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

694
00:55:44.385 --> 00:55:45.720
Hmm...

695
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.726
Much anger in him,

696
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.770
like his father.

697
00:55:53.853 --> 00:55:56.606
<i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>

698
00:55:58.816 --> 00:56:00.693
No.

699
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.528
He is not ready.

700
00:56:02.612 --> 00:56:03.905
Yoda.

701
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.659
I am ready.

702
00:56:08.785 --> 00:56:09.994
Ben... I can be a Jedi.

703
00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:12.038
Ben, tell him I'm...

704
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:13.664
Ready, are you?

705
00:56:13.748 --> 00:56:15.917
What know you ready?

706
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.962
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

707
00:56:20.046 --> 00:56:23.716
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

708
00:56:25.802 --> 00:56:29.764
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

709
00:56:29.847 --> 00:56:31.766
The most serious mind.

710
00:56:33.351 --> 00:56:36.479
This one a long time have I watched.

711
00:56:37.563 --> 00:56:40.566
All his life has he looked away...

712
00:56:40.775 --> 00:56:43.861
to the future, to the horizon.

713
00:56:43.945 --> 00:56:47.365
Never his mind on where he was,

714
00:56:47.448 --> 00:56:48.699
hmm?

715
00:56:48.783 --> 00:56:50.743
What he was doing.

716
00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:52.286
Hmph!

717
00:56:52.578 --> 00:56:53.663
Adventure.

718
00:56:53.746 --> 00:56:54.747
Ha!

719
00:56:54.831 --> 00:56:56.165
Excitement. Ha!

720
00:56:56.499 --> 00:56:58.960
A Jedi craves not these things.

721
00:56:59.836 --> 00:57:01.754
You are reckless!

722
00:57:01.838 --> 00:57:04.841
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

723
00:57:05.174 --> 00:57:06.592
He is too old.

724
00:57:08.052 --> 00:57:10.638
Yes, too old to begin the training.

725
00:57:11.305 --> 00:57:13.015
But I've learned so much.

726
00:57:16.644 --> 00:57:17.895
Ahh...

727
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.400
Will he finish what he begins?

728
00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:24.610
I won't fail you.

729
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.363
I'm not afraid.

730
00:57:28.906 --> 00:57:30.116
Oh...

731
00:57:31.826 --> 00:57:33.494
You will be.

732
00:57:35.121 --> 00:57:36.789
You will be.

733
00:58:17.955 --> 00:58:19.165
Aah!

734
00:58:19.248 --> 00:58:20.917
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

735
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.627
I'm not really interested
in your opinion, 3PO.

736
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:23.961
There's something out there.

737
00:58:24.962 --> 00:58:25.963
Where?

738
00:58:26.047 --> 00:58:27.048
Outside in the cave.

739
00:58:28.633 --> 00:58:30.051
There it is. Listen. Listen!

740
00:58:30.134 --> 00:58:31.177
I'm going out there.

741
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.261
Are you crazy?

742
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.346
I just got this bucket back together.

743
00:58:33.429 --> 00:58:35.014
I'm not going to let something
tear it apart.

744
00:58:35.097 --> 00:58:36.891
Oh! Then I'm going with you.

745
00:58:37.892 --> 00:58:39.352
I think it might be better

746
00:58:39.435 --> 00:58:41.479
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

747
00:58:41.562 --> 00:58:42.563
Oh, no.

748
00:58:57.328 --> 00:58:59.872
This ground sure feels strange.

749
00:59:01.123 --> 00:59:03.042
It doesn't feel like rock.

750
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:07.797
Hmm.

751
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.674
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

752
00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:11.217
I don't know.

753
00:59:11.842 --> 00:59:14.345
I have a bad feeling about this.

754
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.805
Yeah.

755
00:59:17.265 --> 00:59:18.266
Watch out!

756
00:59:19.517 --> 00:59:20.768
It's all right.

757
00:59:20.851 --> 00:59:21.852
It's all right.

758
00:59:21.936 --> 00:59:24.814
Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.

759
00:59:24.897 --> 00:59:28.150
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached,

760
00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:30.194
chewing on the power cables.

761
00:59:30.278 --> 00:59:31.737
Mynocks.

762
00:59:31.862 --> 00:59:34.073
Go on inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

763
00:59:38.619 --> 00:59:39.620
Han!

764
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:44.792
Aagghh! Go away, go away, beastly thing!

765
00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:45.960
Shoo! Shoo!

766
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.719
Wait a minute...

767
01:00:16.449 --> 01:00:17.700
Let's get out of here!

768
01:00:17.783 --> 01:00:19.994
The Empire is still out there!
I don't think...

769
01:00:20.077 --> 01:00:21.746
No time to discuss this in committee!

770
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.582
I'm not a committee!

771
01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:33.257
You can't make the jump
to light speed in this asteroid field.

772
01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:35.509
Sit down, sweetheart! We're taking off!

773
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.931
Look!

774
01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:42.183
I see it. I see it.

775
01:00:42.266 --> 01:00:43.267
We're doomed!

776
01:00:43.351 --> 01:00:44.602
The cave is collapsing.

777
01:00:44.685 --> 01:00:46.687
- This is no cave.
- What?

778
01:01:19.303 --> 01:01:20.304
Run!

779
01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:25.393
Yes! A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

780
01:01:25.476 --> 01:01:27.269
But beware of the dark side.

781
01:01:27.353 --> 01:01:29.063
Anger, fear, aggression...

782
01:01:29.146 --> 01:01:32.233
The dark side of the Force are they,

783
01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:35.236
easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

784
01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:37.613
If once you start down the dark path,

785
01:01:37.696 --> 01:01:39.740
forever will it dominate your destiny.

786
01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:41.158
Consume you it will,

787
01:01:41.242 --> 01:01:43.327
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

788
01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:45.162
Vader.

789
01:01:46.038 --> 01:01:47.456
Is the dark side stronger?

790
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.041
No, no.

791
01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:50.418
No.

792
01:01:50.501 --> 01:01:53.045
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

793
01:01:53.921 --> 01:01:56.006
But how am I to know
the good side from the bad?

794
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:59.593
You will know when you are calm,

795
01:01:59.677 --> 01:02:01.262
at peace,

796
01:02:01.554 --> 01:02:03.055
passive.

797
01:02:03.139 --> 01:02:08.185
Hmm. A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence,

798
01:02:08.644 --> 01:02:10.396
never for attack.

799
01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:11.480
But tell me why I can't...

800
01:02:11.564 --> 01:02:13.607
No, no. There is no why.

801
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:16.485
Nothing more will I teach you today.

802
01:02:17.027 --> 01:02:19.196
Clear your mind of questions.

803
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:23.033
Hmm...

804
01:02:23.117 --> 01:02:24.618
Mmm...

805
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.888
There's something not right here.

806
01:02:47.892 --> 01:02:49.477
I feel cold...

807
01:02:49.768 --> 01:02:50.853
death.

808
01:02:50.936 --> 01:02:53.022
That place...

809
01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:56.233
is strong with the dark side
of the Force.

810
01:02:56.567 --> 01:02:58.819
A domain of evil it is.

811
01:03:00.237 --> 01:03:01.989
In you must go.

812
01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:04.575
What's in there?

813
01:03:06.827 --> 01:03:08.704
Only what you take with you.

814
01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:14.418
Your weapons...

815
01:03:15.085 --> 01:03:16.962
you will not need them.

816
01:05:44.902 --> 01:05:45.903
Hmph.

817
01:05:56.622 --> 01:05:59.083
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

818
01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:00.376
Yes, sir.

819
01:06:00.459 --> 01:06:02.544
Those Rebels won't escape us.

820
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:11.011
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer <i>Avenger.</i>

821
01:06:11.095 --> 01:06:12.429
Right.

822
01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.265
There will be a substantial reward

823
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:18.894
for the one who finds
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

824
01:06:18.977 --> 01:06:21.980
You are free to use
any methods necessary,

825
01:06:22.189 --> 01:06:24.316
but I want them alive.

826
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.735
No disintegrations.

827
01:06:26.819 --> 01:06:27.903
As you wish.

828
01:06:27.986 --> 01:06:29.363
Lord Vader.

829
01:06:30.864 --> 01:06:32.908
My lord, we have them.

830
01:06:37.538 --> 01:06:40.666
Oh, thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

831
01:06:45.587 --> 01:06:47.715
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

832
01:06:48.257 --> 01:06:49.425
One...

833
01:06:49.508 --> 01:06:51.260
two...

834
01:06:51.343 --> 01:06:52.511
three!

835
01:06:58.058 --> 01:06:59.476
It's not fair.

836
01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.894
Gahhh!

837
01:07:02.896 --> 01:07:05.399
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault!

838
01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:06.483
No light speed?

839
01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.485
It's not my fault.

840
01:07:13.282 --> 01:07:15.284
Sir, we've just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

841
01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:17.578
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

842
01:07:17.828 --> 01:07:18.912
Turn her around.

843
01:07:19.079 --> 01:07:20.372
I said, turn her around.

844
01:07:20.456 --> 01:07:21.915
I'm going to put all power
in the front shield.

845
01:07:21.999 --> 01:07:23.000
You're going to attack them?

846
01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:24.168
Sir, the odds of surviving

847
01:07:24.251 --> 01:07:26.086
a direct assault on
an Imperial Star Destroyer...

848
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.130
- Shut up!
- Gaahh!

849
01:07:34.803 --> 01:07:36.805
They're moving to attack position.

850
01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:40.350
Shields up.

851
01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.442
Track them.
They may come around for another pass.

852
01:07:48.525 --> 01:07:50.861
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

853
01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.863
They can't have disappeared.

854
01:07:53.363 --> 01:07:55.574
No ship that small
has a cloaking device.

855
01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:57.159
Well, there's no trace of them, sir.

856
01:07:57.242 --> 01:07:59.369
Captain, Lord Vader
demands an update on the pursuit.

857
01:08:01.955 --> 01:08:03.707
Get a shuttle ready.

858
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.335
I shall assume full responsibility
for losing them

859
01:08:06.418 --> 01:08:08.045
and apologise to Lord Vader.

860
01:08:08.462 --> 01:08:10.047
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.

861
01:08:10.464 --> 01:08:11.965
Yes, Captain Needa.

862
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:18.722
Use the Force.

863
01:08:18.806 --> 01:08:19.807
Yes.

864
01:08:25.312 --> 01:08:26.897
Now, the stone...

865
01:08:31.318 --> 01:08:33.362
Feel it.

866
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.416
Concentrate!

867
01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:04.434
Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

868
01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:06.144
So certain are you.

869
01:09:10.107 --> 01:09:13.193
Always with you it cannot be done.

870
01:09:14.695 --> 01:09:16.697
Hear you nothing that I say?

871
01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.824
Master, moving stones around
is one thing.

872
01:09:18.907 --> 01:09:20.534
This is totally different.

873
01:09:20.909 --> 01:09:22.578
No! No different!

874
01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:24.955
Only different in your mind.

875
01:09:25.205 --> 01:09:28.792
You must unlearn what you have learned.

876
01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:31.461
All right. I'll give it a try.

877
01:09:31.545 --> 01:09:33.130
No! Try not.

878
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.591
Do.

879
01:09:35.674 --> 01:09:36.925
Or do not.

880
01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:38.927
There is no try.

881
01:10:26.224 --> 01:10:29.519
I can't. It's too big.

882
01:10:30.062 --> 01:10:33.565
Size matters not. Look at me.

883
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:35.859
Judge me by my size, do you?

884
01:10:35.943 --> 01:10:36.944
Hmm?

885
01:10:37.027 --> 01:10:38.570
Hmph!

886
01:10:38.654 --> 01:10:40.822
And well you should not,

887
01:10:41.281 --> 01:10:44.034
for my ally is the Force.

888
01:10:44.117 --> 01:10:47.037
And a powerful ally it is.

889
01:10:47.329 --> 01:10:49.498
Life creates it,

890
01:10:49.957 --> 01:10:51.458
makes it grow.

891
01:10:52.876 --> 01:10:56.046
Its energy surrounds us...

892
01:10:56.588 --> 01:10:58.048
and binds us.

893
01:10:58.298 --> 01:11:00.467
Luminous beings are we,

894
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.302
not this crude matter.

895
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:06.640
You must feel the Force around you.

896
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:10.018
Here, between you, me,

897
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.939
the tree, the rock, everywhere!

898
01:11:14.606 --> 01:11:15.899
Yes...

899
01:11:16.692 --> 01:11:20.404
Even between the land and the ship.

900
01:11:25.325 --> 01:11:27.327
You want the impossible.

901
01:13:01.963 --> 01:13:03.882
Mmm...

902
01:13:15.102 --> 01:13:16.103
I don't...

903
01:13:16.186 --> 01:13:18.522
I don't believe it.

904
01:13:19.147 --> 01:13:21.775
That is why you fail.

905
01:13:41.086 --> 01:13:45.173
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

906
01:13:52.931 --> 01:13:54.891
Lord Vader, our ships have completed

907
01:13:54.975 --> 01:13:56.560
their scan of the area
and found nothing.

908
01:13:56.643 --> 01:13:58.645
If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
went into light speed

909
01:13:58.728 --> 01:14:00.397
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

910
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.648
Alert all commands.

911
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:06.862
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

912
01:14:06.945 --> 01:14:08.196
Yes, my lord. We'll find them.

913
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.323
Don't fail me again...

914
01:14:11.324 --> 01:14:12.409
Admiral.

915
01:14:15.078 --> 01:14:16.705
Alert all commands.

916
01:14:16.788 --> 01:14:18.456
Deploy the fleet.

917
01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.515
Captain Solo,
this time you've gone too far.

918
01:14:35.599 --> 01:14:36.725
Gahhh!

919
01:14:36.808 --> 01:14:39.936
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

920
01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.271
The fleet's beginning to break up.

921
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:44.816
Go back and stand by
the manual release for the landing claw.

922
01:14:47.319 --> 01:14:49.487
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

923
01:14:49.696 --> 01:14:53.158
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

924
01:14:53.241 --> 01:14:55.118
The Empire may be gracious enough...

925
01:14:55.202 --> 01:14:56.203
Thank you.

926
01:14:56.286 --> 01:14:57.996
What do you have in your mind
for your next move?

927
01:14:58.079 --> 01:14:59.998
If they follow standard
Imperial procedure,

928
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:02.042
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed,

929
01:15:02.125 --> 01:15:04.044
and then we just float away.

930
01:15:04.127 --> 01:15:06.838
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

931
01:15:06.922 --> 01:15:09.674
Then we got to find a safe port
somewhere around here.

932
01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:11.051
Any ideas?

933
01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:12.469
Where are we?

934
01:15:12.552 --> 01:15:14.054
The Anoat system.

935
01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:16.056
I know that system.
There's not much there.

936
01:15:16.139 --> 01:15:20.018
No. Well, wait. This is interesting.

937
01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:21.186
Lando.

938
01:15:21.269 --> 01:15:22.812
Lando system?

939
01:15:22.896 --> 01:15:26.149
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

940
01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:29.569
He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.

941
01:15:29.653 --> 01:15:31.655
- You'd like him.
- Thanks.

942
01:15:31.738 --> 01:15:34.908
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

943
01:15:35.533 --> 01:15:37.202
A mining colony?

944
01:15:37.285 --> 01:15:39.329
Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

945
01:15:39.746 --> 01:15:42.332
Lando conned somebody out of it.

946
01:15:42.415 --> 01:15:45.252
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

947
01:15:46.086 --> 01:15:47.295
Can you trust him?

948
01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:51.716
No. But he's got no love for the Empire,
I can tell you that.

949
01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.844
Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.

950
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:56.054
Detach.

951
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:04.771
You do have your moments.

952
01:16:05.188 --> 01:16:06.523
Not many of them,

953
01:16:06.606 --> 01:16:08.275
but you do have them.

954
01:16:42.892 --> 01:16:44.561
Concentrate.

955
01:16:44.644 --> 01:16:47.939
Feel the Force flow.

956
01:16:48.023 --> 01:16:50.191
Yes.

957
01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:58.575
Good.

958
01:16:59.409 --> 01:17:00.910
Calm.

959
01:17:00.994 --> 01:17:02.412
Yes.

960
01:17:02.996 --> 01:17:05.957
Through the Force, things you will see.

961
01:17:06.041 --> 01:17:09.502
Other places. The future. The past.

962
01:17:09.586 --> 01:17:12.172
Old friends long gone.

963
01:17:14.341 --> 01:17:15.592
Han?

964
01:17:16.092 --> 01:17:17.177
Leia!

965
01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.515
Hmm...

966
01:17:22.599 --> 01:17:24.100
Control, control.

967
01:17:24.184 --> 01:17:26.102
You must learn control!

968
01:17:29.064 --> 01:17:32.359
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

969
01:17:32.942 --> 01:17:33.985
Hmm...

970
01:17:34.069 --> 01:17:36.571
Friends you have there.

971
01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:38.615
They were in pain.

972
01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:41.201
It is the future you see.

973
01:17:42.702 --> 01:17:43.703
Future?

974
01:17:52.337 --> 01:17:53.630
Will they die?

975
01:17:56.966 --> 01:17:58.468
Difficult to see.

976
01:17:59.344 --> 01:18:01.346
Always in motion is the future.

977
01:18:04.307 --> 01:18:06.017
I've got to go to them.

978
01:18:07.602 --> 01:18:10.230
Decide you must how to serve them best.

979
01:18:10.605 --> 01:18:13.108
If you leave now, help them you could,

980
01:18:14.651 --> 01:18:18.279
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

981
01:18:32.085 --> 01:18:35.171
No, I don't have a landing permit.

982
01:18:35.255 --> 01:18:39.175
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

983
01:18:39.259 --> 01:18:41.344
Wait a minute! Let me explain!

984
01:18:41.428 --> 01:18:43.179
<i>You will not deviate
from your present course.</i>

985
01:18:43.263 --> 01:18:44.514
Rather touchy, aren't they?

986
01:18:44.764 --> 01:18:46.307
I thought you knew this person.

987
01:18:46.391 --> 01:18:48.309
Gaah!

988
01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.228
That was a long time ago.

989
01:18:50.311 --> 01:18:51.729
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

990
01:19:00.488 --> 01:19:04.242
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 3-2-7.</i>

991
01:19:04.325 --> 01:19:05.702
Thank you.

992
01:19:06.494 --> 01:19:07.704
Nothing to worry about.

993
01:19:07.787 --> 01:19:09.497
We go way back, Lando and me.

994
01:19:09.998 --> 01:19:11.374
Who's worried?

995
01:19:59.797 --> 01:20:01.549
Oh. No one to meet us.

996
01:20:02.842 --> 01:20:03.885
I don't like this.

997
01:20:05.178 --> 01:20:06.429
Well, what would you like?

998
01:20:06.513 --> 01:20:08.223
They did let us land.

999
01:20:08.306 --> 01:20:10.975
Look, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

1000
01:20:11.059 --> 01:20:12.227
Trust me.

1001
01:20:17.148 --> 01:20:19.025
See? My friend.

1002
01:20:23.821 --> 01:20:25.782
Keep your eyes open, huh?

1003
01:20:26.199 --> 01:20:27.784
Gahhh!

1004
01:20:28.326 --> 01:20:29.452
Hey!

1005
01:20:30.078 --> 01:20:31.287
Why, you slimy,

1006
01:20:31.371 --> 01:20:34.082
double-crossing, no-good swindler.

1007
01:20:34.707 --> 01:20:38.503
You've got a lot of guts coming here
after what you pulled.

1008
01:20:49.556 --> 01:20:52.934
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

1009
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:56.229
Well, he seems very friendly.

1010
01:20:56.312 --> 01:20:57.313
Yes.

1011
01:20:57.397 --> 01:20:59.399
Very friendly.

1012
01:20:59.482 --> 01:21:00.775
What are you doing here?

1013
01:21:00.858 --> 01:21:03.319
Ah, repairs.
I thought you could help me out.

1014
01:21:03.403 --> 01:21:04.529
What have you done to my ship?

1015
01:21:04.612 --> 01:21:05.613
Your ship?

1016
01:21:05.863 --> 01:21:07.490
Hey, remember,

1017
01:21:07.574 --> 01:21:09.659
you lost her to me fair and square.

1018
01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:11.619
And how you doin', Chewbacca?

1019
01:21:11.703 --> 01:21:12.704
Gahh!

1020
01:21:12.787 --> 01:21:14.122
You still hanging around
with this loser?

1021
01:21:14.706 --> 01:21:16.207
Gahhh!

1022
01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:19.836
Hello. What have we here?

1023
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:22.338
Welcome, I'm Lando Calrissian.

1024
01:21:22.422 --> 01:21:24.215
I'm the administrator of this facility.

1025
01:21:24.591 --> 01:21:26.217
And who might you be?

1026
01:21:26.301 --> 01:21:27.385
Leia.

1027
01:21:27.885 --> 01:21:29.345
Welcome, Leia.

1028
01:21:32.265 --> 01:21:35.560
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

1029
01:21:35.643 --> 01:21:38.771
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1030
01:21:38.855 --> 01:21:40.189
My facilities are at your...

1031
01:21:41.065 --> 01:21:42.191
Well, really!

1032
01:21:42.275 --> 01:21:43.943
What's wrong with the <i>Falcon?</i>

1033
01:21:44.027 --> 01:21:45.028
Hyperdrive.

1034
01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:46.779
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

1035
01:21:46.863 --> 01:21:48.615
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

1036
01:21:48.698 --> 01:21:51.618
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

1037
01:21:52.577 --> 01:21:55.413
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

1038
01:21:55.496 --> 01:21:56.748
Oh, not as well as I'd like.

1039
01:21:56.831 --> 01:21:59.208
We're a small outpost
and not very self-sufficient.

1040
01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:03.755
I've had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labour difficulties.

1041
01:22:03.838 --> 01:22:05.506
What's so funny?

1042
01:22:06.132 --> 01:22:07.467
You. Listen to you.

1043
01:22:07.967 --> 01:22:09.344
You sound like a businessman,

1044
01:22:09.427 --> 01:22:10.720
a responsible leader.

1045
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:13.139
Who'd have thought that, huh?

1046
01:22:13.222 --> 01:22:15.683
Seeing you brings back a few things.

1047
01:22:16.184 --> 01:22:17.226
Yeah.

1048
01:22:17.477 --> 01:22:19.228
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

1049
01:22:20.396 --> 01:22:22.899
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

1050
01:22:25.526 --> 01:22:27.612
Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face.

1051
01:22:27.695 --> 01:22:28.696
<i>E chu ta!</i>

1052
01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.073
How rude!

1053
01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:33.951
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

1054
01:22:34.035 --> 01:22:35.453
I wonder if... Hello?

1055
01:22:37.789 --> 01:22:39.123
How interesting.

1056
01:22:39.207 --> 01:22:40.375
Who are you?

1057
01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:42.710
Oh, my! I... I'm terribly sorry.

1058
01:22:42.794 --> 01:22:44.003
I didn't mean to intrude.

1059
01:22:44.087 --> 01:22:45.213
No, please don't get up.

1060
01:22:51.511 --> 01:22:52.845
Gahhh.

1061
01:23:03.398 --> 01:23:05.900
Luke, you must complete the training.

1062
01:23:06.317 --> 01:23:09.779
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
They're my friends. I got to help them.

1063
01:23:09.862 --> 01:23:12.031
You must not go.

1064
01:23:12.115 --> 01:23:13.950
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

1065
01:23:14.033 --> 01:23:15.451
<i>You don't know that.</i>

1066
01:23:17.912 --> 01:23:19.831
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

1067
01:23:20.915 --> 01:23:22.291
But I can help them.

1068
01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:23.710
I feel the Force.

1069
01:23:23.793 --> 01:23:25.378
But you cannot control it.

1070
01:23:25.753 --> 01:23:27.880
This is a dangerous time for you,

1071
01:23:28.297 --> 01:23:31.801
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

1072
01:23:31.884 --> 01:23:34.846
Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen.

1073
01:23:35.638 --> 01:23:39.434
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

1074
01:23:39.517 --> 01:23:41.686
But I've learned so much since then.

1075
01:23:41.769 --> 01:23:44.230
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and to finish what I've begun.

1076
01:23:44.313 --> 01:23:45.565
You have my word.

1077
01:23:46.691 --> 01:23:49.485
It is you and your abilities
the Emperor wants.

1078
01:23:49.569 --> 01:23:52.405
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

1079
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:55.491
That's why I have to go.

1080
01:23:55.825 --> 01:24:00.872
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

1081
01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:02.582
You won't.

1082
01:24:03.124 --> 01:24:04.584
Stopped they must be.

1083
01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:06.961
On this all depends.

1084
01:24:07.336 --> 01:24:09.505
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,

1085
01:24:09.589 --> 01:24:11.424
with the Force as his ally,

1086
01:24:11.507 --> 01:24:14.010
will conquer Vader and his Emperor.

1087
01:24:14.302 --> 01:24:16.345
If you end your training now,

1088
01:24:16.637 --> 01:24:20.683
if you choose the quick
and easy path, as Vader did,

1089
01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:23.519
you will become an agent of evil.

1090
01:24:23.603 --> 01:24:24.604
Patience.

1091
01:24:25.313 --> 01:24:26.814
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

1092
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:30.943
If you honour
what they fight for... yes.

1093
01:24:31.027 --> 01:24:32.737
If you choose to face Vader,

1094
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.113
you will do it alone.

1095
01:24:34.405 --> 01:24:36.073
I cannot interfere.

1096
01:24:38.242 --> 01:24:39.452
I understand.

1097
01:24:44.791 --> 01:24:46.584
R2.

1098
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:48.127
Fire up the converters.

1099
01:24:51.005 --> 01:24:52.048
Luke!

1100
01:24:53.132 --> 01:24:55.384
Don't give in to hate.

1101
01:24:55.468 --> 01:24:58.054
That leads to the dark side.

1102
01:24:58.346 --> 01:24:59.639
Strong is Vader.

1103
01:24:59.722 --> 01:25:02.642
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

1104
01:25:03.392 --> 01:25:04.393
I will.

1105
01:25:04.727 --> 01:25:06.103
And I'll return.

1106
01:25:06.187 --> 01:25:07.772
I promise.

1107
01:25:14.529 --> 01:25:15.780
Told you, I did.

1108
01:25:15.863 --> 01:25:17.615
Reckless is he.

1109
01:25:17.698 --> 01:25:18.783
Now...

1110
01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:20.952
matters are worse.

1111
01:25:21.035 --> 01:25:23.329
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

1112
01:25:23.412 --> 01:25:25.873
No, there is another.

1113
01:25:58.447 --> 01:25:59.448
The ship's almost finished.

1114
01:25:59.532 --> 01:26:01.701
Two or three more things
and we're in great shape.

1115
01:26:01.784 --> 01:26:03.870
The sooner the better.
Something is wrong here.

1116
01:26:03.953 --> 01:26:05.955
No one has seen
or knows anything about 3PO.

1117
01:26:06.038 --> 01:26:08.457
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

1118
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:12.587
Relax. I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

1119
01:26:13.337 --> 01:26:15.464
I don't trust Lando.

1120
01:26:15.798 --> 01:26:17.884
Well, I don't trust him either.

1121
01:26:17.967 --> 01:26:20.595
But he is my friend. Besides...

1122
01:26:20.678 --> 01:26:22.555
we'll soon be gone.

1123
01:26:23.848 --> 01:26:25.558
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

1124
01:26:59.258 --> 01:27:00.635
Gaahh!

1125
01:27:00.718 --> 01:27:01.761
What happened?

1126
01:27:03.596 --> 01:27:04.805
Where?

1127
01:27:04.889 --> 01:27:06.182
Gahhh!

1128
01:27:06.265 --> 01:27:07.391
Found him in a junk pile?

1129
01:27:07.934 --> 01:27:10.770
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

1130
01:27:11.103 --> 01:27:13.022
Gahhh!

1131
01:27:13.105 --> 01:27:14.857
Lando's got people that can fix him.

1132
01:27:14.941 --> 01:27:16.275
No, thanks.

1133
01:27:18.069 --> 01:27:20.071
I'm sorry, am I interrupting anything?

1134
01:27:20.613 --> 01:27:21.906
Not really.

1135
01:27:25.576 --> 01:27:27.662
You look absolutely beautiful.

1136
01:27:27.995 --> 01:27:31.123
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

1137
01:27:31.207 --> 01:27:32.708
Thank you.

1138
01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:34.418
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

1139
01:27:35.628 --> 01:27:37.129
Everyone's invited, of course.

1140
01:27:39.215 --> 01:27:40.716
Having trouble with your droid?

1141
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.468
No, no problem.

1142
01:27:42.551 --> 01:27:43.594
Why?

1143
01:27:52.395 --> 01:27:54.188
You see,
since we're a small operation,

1144
01:27:54.563 --> 01:27:58.234
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

1145
01:27:58.317 --> 01:27:59.944
So you're part
of the Mining Guild, then?

1146
01:28:00.027 --> 01:28:03.239
No, not actually. Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed.

1147
01:28:03.322 --> 01:28:05.241
Which is advantageous for everybody,

1148
01:28:05.324 --> 01:28:09.412
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

1149
01:28:10.162 --> 01:28:12.081
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out

1150
01:28:12.164 --> 01:28:14.166
about this little operation,
shut you down?

1151
01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:15.251
It's always been a danger

1152
01:28:15.334 --> 01:28:17.003
that looms like a shadow
over everything we've built.

1153
01:28:17.086 --> 01:28:19.588
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

1154
01:28:19.672 --> 01:28:22.925
I've just made a deal that will keep
the Empire out of here forever.

1155
01:28:33.352 --> 01:28:36.230
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

1156
01:28:42.945 --> 01:28:45.614
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

1157
01:28:46.157 --> 01:28:47.366
I'm sorry.

1158
01:28:51.787 --> 01:28:53.289
I'm sorry, too.

1159
01:28:55.207 --> 01:28:57.084
Gahhh.

1160
01:29:08.012 --> 01:29:09.180
No, 3PO's with them.

1161
01:29:10.723 --> 01:29:12.349
Just hang on. We're almost there.

1162
01:30:10.282 --> 01:30:11.450
Oh, ah, ooh, ah.

1163
01:30:11.909 --> 01:30:13.452
I'm terribly sorry.

1164
01:30:13.536 --> 01:30:15.704
I didn't mean to intrude.
No, please don't get up.

1165
01:30:20.459 --> 01:30:23.295
No! Secret. Stormtroopers?

1166
01:30:23.379 --> 01:30:25.798
Here? We're in danger!

1167
01:30:25.881 --> 01:30:27.299
I must tell the others.

1168
01:30:27.383 --> 01:30:28.467
Oh, no, I've been shot!

1169
01:30:55.995 --> 01:30:57.329
Lord Vader.

1170
01:30:58.122 --> 01:31:02.918
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hutt after I have Skywalker.

1171
01:31:03.002 --> 01:31:04.920
He's no good to me dead.

1172
01:31:05.004 --> 01:31:07.923
He will not be
permanently damaged.

1173
01:31:10.176 --> 01:31:13.179
Lord Vader,
what about Leia and the Wookiee?

1174
01:31:13.262 --> 01:31:16.098
They must never again leave this city.

1175
01:31:16.182 --> 01:31:17.766
That was never a condition
of our agreement,

1176
01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:19.351
nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter.

1177
01:31:19.435 --> 01:31:23.564
Perhaps you think
you're being treated unfairly?

1178
01:31:25.524 --> 01:31:26.567
No.

1179
01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:30.946
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

1180
01:31:32.865 --> 01:31:35.242
This deal is getting worse all the time.

1181
01:31:36.452 --> 01:31:38.871
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

1182
01:31:38.954 --> 01:31:40.289
Oh!

1183
01:31:40.748 --> 01:31:43.250
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

1184
01:31:43.751 --> 01:31:47.129
Oh, oh, oh, that's much better.

1185
01:31:47.963 --> 01:31:49.506
Wait! Wait!

1186
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:51.926
Oh, my! What have you done?

1187
01:31:52.009 --> 01:31:55.137
I'm backwards,
you flea-bitten furball!

1188
01:31:55.304 --> 01:31:58.224
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

1189
01:32:12.863 --> 01:32:14.281
I feel terrible.

1190
01:32:14.365 --> 01:32:15.699
Gahhh.

1191
01:32:29.838 --> 01:32:31.632
Why are they doing this?

1192
01:32:34.551 --> 01:32:36.845
They never even asked me
any questions.

1193
01:32:42.101 --> 01:32:43.269
Lando.

1194
01:32:46.981 --> 01:32:48.065
Get out of here, Lando.

1195
01:32:48.148 --> 01:32:49.525
Shut up and listen!

1196
01:32:49.608 --> 01:32:51.110
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

1197
01:32:51.193 --> 01:32:52.319
Over to you?

1198
01:32:52.403 --> 01:32:53.988
They'll have to stay here,
but at least they'll be safe.

1199
01:32:54.071 --> 01:32:55.072
What about Han?

1200
01:32:55.155 --> 01:32:56.282
Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

1201
01:32:56.615 --> 01:32:58.200
Vader wants us all dead.

1202
01:32:58.284 --> 01:33:01.245
He doesn't want you at all.
He's after somebody called Skywalker.

1203
01:33:02.037 --> 01:33:04.248
- Luke.
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.

1204
01:33:04.331 --> 01:33:05.416
And we're the bait!

1205
01:33:05.499 --> 01:33:07.251
He's on his way.

1206
01:33:08.168 --> 01:33:10.379
You fixed us all real good, didn't you?

1207
01:33:10.462 --> 01:33:12.172
My friend.

1208
01:33:14.091 --> 01:33:15.175
Stop!

1209
01:33:17.344 --> 01:33:18.762
I've done all I can.

1210
01:33:19.346 --> 01:33:22.016
I'm sorry I couldn't do better,
but I've got my own problems.

1211
01:33:22.099 --> 01:33:23.350
Yeah.

1212
01:33:23.642 --> 01:33:25.561
You're a real hero.

1213
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.990
You certainly have a way with people.

1214
01:33:42.077 --> 01:33:43.746
Ah... Ah...

1215
01:33:52.755 --> 01:33:54.923
This facility is crude,

1216
01:33:55.007 --> 01:33:57.843
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker

1217
01:33:57.926 --> 01:34:00.304
for his journey to the Emperor.

1218
01:34:00.387 --> 01:34:03.265
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

1219
01:34:03.349 --> 01:34:06.852
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

1220
01:34:08.062 --> 01:34:11.231
Lord Vader, we only use
this facility for carbon freezing.

1221
01:34:11.315 --> 01:34:12.983
You put him in there, it might kill him.

1222
01:34:13.067 --> 01:34:15.986
I do not want
the Emperor's prize damaged.

1223
01:34:16.111 --> 01:34:18.947
We will test it on Captain Solo.

1224
01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.556
If only you'd attached my legs,

1225
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.600
I wouldn't be in
this ridiculous position.

1226
01:34:47.267 --> 01:34:50.187
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me,

1227
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:52.189
so don't do anything foolish.

1228
01:35:05.744 --> 01:35:07.079
What's going on...

1229
01:35:07.162 --> 01:35:08.330
buddy?

1230
01:35:08.872 --> 01:35:11.333
You're being put into carbon freeze.

1231
01:35:11.417 --> 01:35:14.753
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

1232
01:35:14.837 --> 01:35:17.297
The Empire
will compensate you if he dies.

1233
01:35:17.589 --> 01:35:18.715
Put him in.

1234
01:35:21.468 --> 01:35:22.928
No, no, no!

1235
01:35:23.554 --> 01:35:25.722
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

1236
01:35:26.849 --> 01:35:28.934
Yes, stop, please!
I'm not ready to die!

1237
01:35:29.017 --> 01:35:31.353
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

1238
01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:33.021
This won't help me.

1239
01:35:33.105 --> 01:35:34.982
Hey, save your strength.

1240
01:35:35.065 --> 01:35:36.608
There will be another time.

1241
01:35:37.901 --> 01:35:39.695
The princess...

1242
01:35:39.778 --> 01:35:41.613
You have to take care of her.

1243
01:35:43.782 --> 01:35:46.160
Do you hear me? Huh?

1244
01:35:59.673 --> 01:36:01.049
I love you.

1245
01:36:01.467 --> 01:36:02.759
I know.

1246
01:36:23.864 --> 01:36:25.449
Gahhh!

1247
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:33.874
What's going on? Turn around!

1248
01:36:33.957 --> 01:36:35.334
Chewbacca, I can't see.

1249
01:36:50.098 --> 01:36:52.017
Gahhh.

1250
01:37:33.809 --> 01:37:36.645
Oh, they've encased him in carbonite.

1251
01:37:36.728 --> 01:37:38.480
He should be quite well protected,

1252
01:37:38.564 --> 01:37:40.482
if he survived the freezing process,
that is.

1253
01:37:40.566 --> 01:37:43.110
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

1254
01:37:43.193 --> 01:37:45.070
Yes, he's alive.

1255
01:37:45.779 --> 01:37:47.614
And in perfect hibernation.

1256
01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.659
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

1257
01:37:51.159 --> 01:37:53.370
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

1258
01:37:55.622 --> 01:37:57.541
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

1259
01:37:57.791 --> 01:38:01.128
Good. See to it that
he finds his way in here.

1260
01:38:05.757 --> 01:38:10.304
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1261
01:38:10.387 --> 01:38:12.514
You said they'd be left in the city
under my supervision.

1262
01:38:12.598 --> 01:38:14.391
I am altering the deal.

1263
01:38:14.474 --> 01:38:16.977
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1264
01:39:53.448 --> 01:39:54.616
Gahhh!

1265
01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:57.369
Luke! Luke, don't, it's a trap!

1266
01:39:58.745 --> 01:39:59.871
It's a trap!

1267
01:40:45.834 --> 01:40:48.712
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

1268
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:53.049
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1269
01:41:54.861 --> 01:41:56.238
Well done.

1270
01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:02.118
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet. Move.

1271
01:42:07.916 --> 01:42:09.793
What do you think you're doing?

1272
01:42:09.876 --> 01:42:10.919
We're getting out of here.

1273
01:42:11.002 --> 01:42:12.796
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1274
01:42:12.879 --> 01:42:15.757
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, we're going to trust you?

1275
01:42:17.175 --> 01:42:18.468
I had no choice.

1276
01:42:18.552 --> 01:42:20.011
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

1277
01:42:20.095 --> 01:42:23.098
Oh, we understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1278
01:42:23.181 --> 01:42:24.850
I'm just trying to help.

1279
01:42:24.933 --> 01:42:26.726
We don't need any of your help.

1280
01:42:32.274 --> 01:42:33.275
What?

1281
01:42:33.358 --> 01:42:34.359
Han...

1282
01:42:34.442 --> 01:42:35.569
It sounds like "Han."

1283
01:42:35.652 --> 01:42:38.154
There's still a chance to save Han...

1284
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:41.449
at the east...

1285
01:42:41.533 --> 01:42:43.118
platform.

1286
01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.661
Chewie.

1287
01:42:47.163 --> 01:42:49.583
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

1288
01:42:49.666 --> 01:42:51.459
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1289
01:42:51.918 --> 01:42:54.170
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1290
01:43:10.145 --> 01:43:12.647
R2, R2, where have you been?

1291
01:43:12.731 --> 01:43:14.566
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1292
01:43:15.442 --> 01:43:18.612
Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

1293
01:43:20.739 --> 01:43:23.617
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1294
01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.160
Look what's happened to me.

1295
01:43:38.006 --> 01:43:40.300
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

1296
01:43:53.647 --> 01:43:55.941
You have learned much, young one.

1297
01:43:56.024 --> 01:43:58.109
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1298
01:44:09.496 --> 01:44:12.874
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1299
01:44:13.291 --> 01:44:15.585
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1300
01:44:16.127 --> 01:44:17.128
No.

1301
01:44:21.675 --> 01:44:22.676
Aaah!

1302
01:44:24.219 --> 01:44:25.762
All too easy.

1303
01:44:30.767 --> 01:44:33.561
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the Emperor thought.

1304
01:44:36.606 --> 01:44:38.149
Impressive.

1305
01:44:40.068 --> 01:44:41.653
Most impressive.

1306
01:44:44.322 --> 01:44:46.032
Aaah!

1307
01:44:48.994 --> 01:44:50.954
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

1308
01:44:51.037 --> 01:44:53.081
You have controlled your fear.

1309
01:44:55.542 --> 01:44:56.543
Now...

1310
01:44:56.751 --> 01:44:59.087
release your anger.

1311
01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:01.881
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1312
01:45:12.934 --> 01:45:14.144
Oh!

1313
01:47:12.512 --> 01:47:14.764
The security code has been changed.

1314
01:47:14.848 --> 01:47:18.101
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1315
01:47:18.977 --> 01:47:20.103
R2, hurry!

1316
01:47:23.273 --> 01:47:25.108
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.

1317
01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.944
<i>Attention. The Empire
has taken control of the city.</i>

1318
01:47:28.027 --> 01:47:31.531
I advise everyone to leave
before more Imperial troops arrive.

1319
01:47:37.954 --> 01:47:39.122
This way.

1320
01:47:39.205 --> 01:47:41.749
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1321
01:47:41.833 --> 01:47:44.502
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1322
01:48:05.732 --> 01:48:08.693
Ah! We're not interested in the
hyperdrive on the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

1323
01:48:08.776 --> 01:48:09.777
It's fixed!

1324
01:48:13.656 --> 01:48:15.992
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

1325
01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:27.128
I never doubted you for a second.

1326
01:48:27.212 --> 01:48:28.254
Wonderful!

1327
01:48:51.069 --> 01:48:53.154
Ouch! Oh! That hurts!

1328
01:48:53.238 --> 01:48:55.406
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

1329
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:01.913
Leia!

1330
01:49:02.497 --> 01:49:03.539
Go!

1331
01:49:10.004 --> 01:49:12.507
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1332
01:49:13.675 --> 01:49:15.051
Of course I've looked better.

1333
01:50:08.938 --> 01:50:10.315
You are beaten.

1334
01:50:10.815 --> 01:50:12.483
It is useless to resist.

1335
01:50:12.734 --> 01:50:15.820
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1336
01:50:26.956 --> 01:50:28.458
Aah!

1337
01:50:31.878 --> 01:50:33.546
There is no escape.

1338
01:50:34.255 --> 01:50:36.549
Don't make me destroy you.

1339
01:50:38.634 --> 01:50:39.677
Luke,

1340
01:50:40.011 --> 01:50:43.222
you do not yet realise your importance.

1341
01:50:43.306 --> 01:50:46.267
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1342
01:50:46.351 --> 01:50:50.646
Join me,
and I will complete your training.

1343
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:53.107
With our combined strength,

1344
01:50:53.191 --> 01:50:58.654
we can end this destructive conflict
and bring order to the galaxy.

1345
01:50:58.738 --> 01:51:00.281
I'll never join you!

1346
01:51:00.615 --> 01:51:04.535
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1347
01:51:05.328 --> 01:51:09.540
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1348
01:51:09.624 --> 01:51:11.417
He told me enough!

1349
01:51:14.087 --> 01:51:15.588
He told me you killed him.

1350
01:51:15.671 --> 01:51:17.048
No.

1351
01:51:17.215 --> 01:51:19.384
I am your father.

1352
01:51:23.763 --> 01:51:25.264
No.

1353
01:51:26.015 --> 01:51:27.392
No.

1354
01:51:27.892 --> 01:51:29.519
That's not true.

1355
01:51:30.978 --> 01:51:32.647
That's impossible!

1356
01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:36.150
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1357
01:51:37.318 --> 01:51:39.821
No!

1358
01:51:40.113 --> 01:51:42.490
No!

1359
01:51:43.408 --> 01:51:44.492
Luke.

1360
01:51:44.575 --> 01:51:46.828
You can destroy the Emperor.

1361
01:51:46.994 --> 01:51:48.955
He has foreseen this.

1362
01:51:49.122 --> 01:51:51.749
It is your destiny.

1363
01:51:52.041 --> 01:51:57.880
Join me, and together we can rule
the galaxy as father and son.

1364
01:52:09.183 --> 01:52:10.560
Come with me.

1365
01:52:11.018 --> 01:52:12.645
It is the only way.

1366
01:52:44.469 --> 01:52:45.553
Ah!

1367
01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:20.671
Ben.

1368
01:53:21.714 --> 01:53:23.424
Ben, please.

1369
01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.310
Ben.

1370
01:53:39.565 --> 01:53:40.858
Leia.

1371
01:53:51.452 --> 01:53:52.703
Hear me.

1372
01:53:54.622 --> 01:53:55.915
Leia.

1373
01:53:56.207 --> 01:53:57.625
Luke.

1374
01:53:59.961 --> 01:54:01.629
We've got to go back.

1375
01:54:01.712 --> 01:54:03.673
- What?
- I know where Luke is.

1376
01:54:03.756 --> 01:54:04.882
What about those fighters?

1377
01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:07.218
Chewie, just do it.

1378
01:54:07.301 --> 01:54:08.636
But what about Vader?

1379
01:54:08.719 --> 01:54:10.054
All right, all right, all right!

1380
01:54:17.937 --> 01:54:21.983
Alert my Star Destroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1381
01:54:32.702 --> 01:54:34.662
Look, someone's up there.

1382
01:54:36.247 --> 01:54:37.290
It's Luke.

1383
01:54:37.373 --> 01:54:38.749
Chewie, slow down.

1384
01:54:38.833 --> 01:54:40.251
Slow down. We'll get under him.

1385
01:54:40.334 --> 01:54:41.961
Lando, open the top hatch.

1386
01:54:58.019 --> 01:54:59.270
Okay.

1387
01:54:59.353 --> 01:55:00.479
Easy, Chewie.

1388
01:55:00.563 --> 01:55:01.606
Gahrrr.

1389
01:55:22.293 --> 01:55:23.294
Lando?

1390
01:55:23.377 --> 01:55:24.462
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1391
01:55:41.562 --> 01:55:43.731
Oh, Leia.

1392
01:55:44.023 --> 01:55:45.316
All right, Chewie, let's go.

1393
01:56:20.935 --> 01:56:22.019
I'll be back.

1394
01:56:28.901 --> 01:56:30.319
Star Destroyer.

1395
01:56:35.366 --> 01:56:37.618
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1396
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.371
If your people
fixed the hyperdrive.

1397
01:56:40.454 --> 01:56:42.707
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1398
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:43.916
Punch it!

1399
01:56:54.927 --> 01:56:56.387
They told me they fixed it.

1400
01:56:57.138 --> 01:56:59.056
I trusted them to fix it!

1401
01:56:59.432 --> 01:57:01.267
It's not my fault!

1402
01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:09.900
They'll be in range of
our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1403
01:57:09.984 --> 01:57:13.779
Did your men deactivate
the hyperdrive on the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

1404
01:57:13.863 --> 01:57:14.864
Yes, my lord.

1405
01:57:14.947 --> 01:57:19.744
Good. Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for "stun."

1406
01:57:19.827 --> 01:57:22.872
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1407
01:57:24.165 --> 01:57:27.042
Noisy brute.
Why don't we just go into light speed?

1408
01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:28.753
We can't?

1409
01:57:29.044 --> 01:57:31.922
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1410
01:57:35.092 --> 01:57:37.553
The city's central computer told you?

1411
01:57:38.012 --> 01:57:40.931
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1412
01:57:41.015 --> 01:57:42.057
Ouch!

1413
01:57:42.141 --> 01:57:44.101
Pay attention to what you're doing!

1414
01:57:55.112 --> 01:57:56.238
Luke.

1415
01:57:56.614 --> 01:57:57.907
Father.

1416
01:57:59.492 --> 01:58:01.827
Son, come with me.

1417
01:58:04.622 --> 01:58:06.040
Ben.

1418
01:58:07.041 --> 01:58:09.043
Why didn't you tell me?

1419
01:58:15.424 --> 01:58:16.425
Chewie!

1420
01:58:27.603 --> 01:58:28.854
It's Vader.

1421
01:58:34.652 --> 01:58:38.030
Luke, it is your destiny.

1422
01:58:42.868 --> 01:58:44.078
Ben.

1423
01:58:45.663 --> 01:58:47.498
Why didn't you tell me?

1424
01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:56.215
Alert all commands.

1425
01:58:56.590 --> 01:58:58.175
Ready for the tractor beam.

1426
01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:02.805
R2, come back at once!

1427
01:59:02.888 --> 01:59:04.807
You haven't finished with me yet.

1428
01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:06.684
You don't know
how to fix the hyperdrive.

1429
01:59:06.767 --> 01:59:08.060
Chewbacca can do it.

1430
01:59:08.143 --> 01:59:09.687
I'm standing here in pieces,

1431
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:12.231
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1432
01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:17.361
You did it!

1433
02:00:14.835 --> 02:00:16.921
Luke, we're ready for take-off.

1434
02:00:17.004 --> 02:00:18.213
<i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1435
02:00:19.298 --> 02:00:21.508
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter,</i>

1436
02:00:21.592 --> 02:00:22.801
<i>we'll contact you.</i>

1437
02:00:23.302 --> 02:00:26.013
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1438
02:00:26.096 --> 02:00:28.140
Princess, we'll find Han.

1439
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:29.642
I promise.

1440
02:00:29.725 --> 02:00:31.685
Chewie,
I'll be waiting for your signal.

1441
02:00:31.977 --> 02:00:33.771
Take care, you two.

1442
02:00:33.854 --> 02:00:35.731
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1443
02:00:35.814 --> 02:00:37.232
Gahhh.

1444
02:00:37.316 --> 02:00:39.944
<i>Gahhh.</i>

1445
02:00:48.994 --> 02:00:49.995
Ow.
