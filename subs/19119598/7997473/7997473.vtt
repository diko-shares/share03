00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:44.245
(suspenseful music continues)
(birds chirp)

6
00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.384
(footsteps thudding)

7
00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.185
- Anything?

8
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.987
- Looks a bit treacherous.

9
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.624
I think we should
keep on moving.

10
00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:57.758
- Oh, come on.

11
00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.560
Where's the daredevil
in you, huh?

12
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.462
Let's document it.

13
00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:02.730
I can take a few shots.

(birds chirp)

17
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.627
This is amazing!

18
00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.065
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

19
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.000
If what they're saying
on the news is correct,

20
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.371
this could be the biggest
natural disaster in history.

21
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.406
In a matter of days.

22
00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:47.275
- That's why we've
gotta get out of dodge.

23
00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.177
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

24
00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.945
- Come on, what's a few photos?

25
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.149
I mean, they just said it
might happen in a few days.

26
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.152
- Yeah, and I bet that's what
they said at Pompeii too.

27
00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:01.889
(thunder cracking)

28
00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.692
- All right, come on, let's go.

29
00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.163
- There's no signal.

30
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.266
We better get back to
the car where it's safe.

31
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:16.103
(suspenseful music continues)

32
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.140

(tree trunk cracking)

34
00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:24.111
- Ooh, whoa!

35
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.515
Oh.

36
00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:28.349
Oh shit!

37
00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.650
- What is it?

38
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:33.754
(thunder rumbling)

39
00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:38.158
(thunder rumbling)

40
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:38.992
Crap!

41
00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:43.497
(lightning striking)
(tree trunk cracking)

42
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.332
- Run!

43
00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:46.734

(suspenseful music continues)

48
00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:08.322

(car engine sputtering)

50
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:15.929
I thought you said it wasn't
supposed to pick up so fast?

51
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.030
- Everything said it wouldn't.

52
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.233
I just don't get it.

53
00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.834
It's not starting.

54
00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.970
- Right, come on!

55
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.473
(car beeping)

56
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.744
(suspenseful music continues)

57
00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:32.112
- Get out.

58
00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.113
Get out now!

59
00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.385
- It won't open!

60
00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:38.252
It won't open!

61
00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:40.254
I can't get out!

62
00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:41.589
I can't get out!

63
00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.224
(thunder cracking)

64
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.559
I can't get out!

(investigator groaning)

67
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.935
- Shit.

(thunder cracking)
(investigator groaning)

69
00:03:57.338 --> 00:03:58.138
Linda, no!

(ground cracking)

71
00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:06.280
Linda! (whimpers)

(thunder cracking)

76
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.132
- [Radio Announcer] The
lightning storm last night

77
00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:27.501
has been described
as a mega storm.

78
00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:31.038
Dr. Becker, a
researcher at the NSSL,

79
00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:33.907
warns that these storms
could become more commonplace

80
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.243
in the wake of global warming.

81
00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:38.312
Some of his working
theories on these storms

82
00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:41.982
from research of similar
in Iceland have so far

83
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.917
been dismissed by rival experts.

84
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.288
Another storm has been
forecast in the coming days.

85
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.824
The previous one was
far more aggressive

86
00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.660
than experts had believed.

87
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.529
Two people have
been reported dead.

88
00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.931
Dr. Becker warns that
further storms could

89
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.669
prove unpredictable
and potentially a
severe threat to life.

90
00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:07.307
(car engine humming)

91
00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.418
(car door bangs)

92
00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:20.521
(footsteps thudding)

93
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.358
- Come on, come on, answer.

94
00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:25.726
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.

95
00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:26.660
You scared the crap out of me.

96
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.961
- Didn't mean to startle you.

97
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.763
- Oh, I just think
it's this storm.

98
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.732
It's gotten me a little shaky.

99
00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.767
And I seem to have
something wrong with my car,

100
00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:35.135
and I can't get
ahold of my husband

101
00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:36.937
to come out here and fix it.

102
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:38.338
- I could take a look.

103
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.807
- I don't wanna trouble you.

104
00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.509
You know, I just live about
10 minutes up the road.

105
00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.944
It's just that I can't seem
to get ahold of my husband

106
00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:47.214
to come out here and
save me. (chuckles)

107
00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:48.215
- What's the matter?

108
00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.383
Were there devils here?

109
00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:53.454
Hey, how about I drop
you off on my way home?

110
00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:55.222
How about that?
- Oh, you know, that's okay.

111
00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:58.459
I appreciate the offer,
but no thank you.

112
00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:00.060
- Well, if it's only 10
minutes away, it's no problem.

113
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.261
- Yeah, you know what?

114
00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:02.763
I'm just gonna wait
for my husband.

115
00:06:02.763 --> 00:06:04.832
I'm gonna try and give him
a call again, actually.

116
00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:06.033
Thank you though.
- Are you sure?

117
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:08.335
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

118
00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:16.677
(footsteps thudding)
(traffic humming)

119
00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.890
(car door bangs)

120
00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:37.698
(suspenseful music)

121
00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.103
(victim gasping)

122
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:47.841
(muffled shouting)
(suspenseful music continues)

123
00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:09.930
- The air breathes of
honesty and most sweetly.

124
00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:16.103
(suspenseful music continues)

125
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:19.206
(car engine humming)

126
00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:28.081
(crickets chirping)

127
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:31.184
(car engine humming)

128
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:36.356
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, thanks.

129
00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:38.492
- Maybe we'll go out
again some other time.

130
00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.797
- You know, I
actually, I had fun.

131
00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:44.898
I'm not usually...

132
00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.701
Well, usually not into
the adventuring style.

133
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.803
- Yeah, well that's why
we practice indoors.

134
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.772
Take it outdoors and
then we'll scale over it.

135
00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.040
- Shut up.

136
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.307
- Yeah, we've gotta stay
away from the mountains

137
00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.242
near Rough Rock Lake though.

138
00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.176
Did you hear about that fellow

139
00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.444
getting vaporized by lightning?

140
00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:58.712
- Yeah, I read about that.

141
00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:00.280
- That'll shocking.

142
00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.617
- Stop it, that's awful.

143
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:06.854
- Anyways, you and
your sister will be

144
00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:08.455
able to host tomorrow?

145
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:12.059
- Yeah, and well I text Sally
and Donal, they're coming.

146
00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:14.061
And Michael And
Charlie can't make it.

147
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:15.596
- Well, Charlie's a twat.

148
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.098
There's no loss there.

149
00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:21.368
- Yeah, my parents will be
leaving I think early afternoon,

150
00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:22.603
so I'll text you.

151
00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.037
- Well, me and Paulie
will sort out booze.

152
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:25.573
What do you like?

153
00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.541
- Don't do anything too strong.

154
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.942
- Girls' drink.

155
00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.210
- Right, it's 2022.

156
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.613
You can't say things
like that, you pig.

157
00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:34.514
- Well, what do you want then?

158
00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:38.919
- Something fruity
or like G and T.

159
00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:41.622
- You mean like a girl's drink?

160
00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:42.956
- Right, if I didn't
like you so much,

161
00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:44.157
I'd cut your balls off.

162
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:48.495
- Well.

163
00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:49.329
- Not.

164
00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:52.499
Not here.

165
00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:55.569
Not in the car, like just
get that out of your head.

166
00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:57.104
- You're getting
me so worked up.

167
00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:59.873
- Not when my parents
are 30 yards away.

168
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.074
- Yeah.

169
00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.475
You want the moment
to be worth it.

170
00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.310
- Yeah.

171
00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:05.679
Thank you.

172
00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.017
- For what?

173
00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.085
- For being patient and...

174
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.988
- No, don't be silly, it's fine.

175
00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:18.091
Go home, have a cold
shower, sort myself out.

176
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.694
(Meg chuckles)

177
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.631
- You're fed up with me.

178
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:24.898
- Look, I don't...

179
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.133
Despite what Paulie
might say about me,

180
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.467
I'm not a player, all right?

181
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:28.669
- Okay.

182
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:29.903
- I'm in there
for the long haul.

183
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.271
I don't wanna ruin
this by rushing it.

184
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.607
You should go inside.

185
00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:36.176
- Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:37.778
I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:40.013
Hey.

188
00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.514
- And we'll keep it PG-13.

189
00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.316
- Okay, bye.

190
00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.317
- All right.

191
00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.656
(car door bangs)

192
00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:51.591
(gravel crunching)

193
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.633
(door knob rattles)

194
00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.736
(door creaks softly)

195
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.306
(door bangs)

196
00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:09.176
(thunder rumbling)

197
00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:10.577
- [Bernie] Kiddo?

198
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.115
(loud rumbling)

199
00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.658
(soft chattering on TV)

200
00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:26.727
- Dad, did you feel that?

201
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:31.398
- Yeah, they said on the news
to expect some heavy thunder.

202
00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.868
They've even told us the
warning stay indoors.

203
00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.469
It's a load of crock, isn't it?

204
00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.273
Who was in the car?

205
00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.309
- Spanish Inquisition?

206
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.778
- No, it's Mastermind,
Dad's edition.

207
00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:45.578
So?

208
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.348
- Just a friend, whatever.

209
00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:50.150
- Mm.

210
00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.085
How was uni then?

211
00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:53.586
- Yeah, it's good.

212
00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.488
Looks all right. (laughs)

213
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.025
- Look, when your mother
and I go on this weekend,

214
00:10:58.025 --> 00:11:00.293
we don't want any shenanigans.

215
00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:02.062
- Shouldn't it be you
two I'm worried about

216
00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:03.496
causing the shenanigans?

217
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.632
- No, well, but we've got plenty
of experience, haven't we?

218
00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:07.167
And we pay the bills.

219
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.202
I don't wanna come back here
and find this place trashed.

220
00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:10.838
- Okay.

221
00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:12.339
What are you reading?

222
00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.909
- Oh, it's a report on the
lightning the other day.

223
00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:19.646
Says that we could be getting
in for more occurrences,

224
00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.381
sometimes even more dangerous.

225
00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.885
(chuckles) Some
crackpot in here says

226
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:27.487
that he thinks the
lightning is tuned

227
00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.256
to the electric current
in the human body.

228
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.291
- Should you even
be going away then?

229
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.692
If it's that dangerous?

230
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.227
Why can't you just stay here?

231
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:39.632
- Look, your mother will lose
her shit if we don't go away.

232
00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.369
We booked this trip ages ago.

233
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.703
It's a fairly safe journey,

234
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.538
and it's only two
hours on the motorway.

235
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.208
- I know, I just
don't want you going,

236
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.709
and then the roads
are gonna be closed,

237
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.245
and then you can't find a way
back if something happens.

238
00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.680
- Your mother's
not gonna complain

239
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.182
if we get stuck in the resort.

240
00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:57.617
- Okay.

241
00:11:58.685 --> 00:11:59.920
Just drive safe.

242
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.489
- Oh, Man United lost.

243
00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.291
- Dad, you know we
have the internet.

244
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.994
I could have told
you that last night.

245
00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:10.263
- Isn't it passed your bedtime?

246
00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.765
- What time is it?

247
00:12:11.765 --> 00:12:13.600
- 10:30.
- 10:30.

248
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.104
Yeah, I'm not 12
anymore, Dad, seriously.

249
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:17.905
- Avante.

250
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.308
- Love you.

251
00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:22.509
- Love you too.

252
00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.878
- Bye.
- Bye, love.

253
00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:32.152
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

254
00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.155
(muffled screaming)

255
00:12:41.795 --> 00:12:44.697
(prisoner panting)

256
00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:50.603
(suspenseful music continues)

257
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.573
(muffled screaming)

258
00:12:56.643 --> 00:13:00.413
(suspenseful music continues)

259
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.353
- Thou hast now to
wait 12 winters.

260
00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.493
Don't you realize no
one's coming for you?

261
00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.797
This is your life now.

262
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.802
They've already stopped
talking about you on the news.

263
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.672
All they're talking
about is this lightning,

264
00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.275
and how everyone
has to stay indoors.

265
00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:32.379
(suspenseful music continues)

266
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:33.813
They didn't even mention you.

267
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:41.388
(kidnapper chuckles)

268
00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:42.856
(prisoner whimpers)

269
00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:47.494
Temper and his wizard,
delicate wench. (chuckles)

270
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.562
(thunder rumbling)

271
00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.299
(spoon clanging)

272
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.671
- You've used all the milk.

273
00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:02.775
Can I have your yogurt then?

274
00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.710
- Don't look at me.

275
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.512
- Oh, you're such a dickhead.

276
00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:09.349
- (chuckles) One of them,
but you owe me another.

277
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.783
- Yeah, I'll get
you a luxurious one

278
00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:13.820
with gold sprinkles on top.

279
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.255
- Sounds good.

280
00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:18.158
(cereal crunching)

281
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.128
- That is rank.

282
00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.598
It's out of date.

283
00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.100
- Why do you think
I'm having cereal?

284
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.835
- Oh my God, asshole.

285
00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:32.372
- Come, you all set for later?

286
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.606
- Yeah.

287
00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.808
- Okay, the boys are
definitely coming.

288
00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:36.944
Is Sally and her
boyfriend still coming?

289
00:14:36.944 --> 00:14:38.245
- Yes.

290
00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.280
- And what about...

291
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.848
- Oh yeah, Paulie
and Sean said they

292
00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:42.849
were gonna do a booze run.

293
00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:43.917
- Okay, okay.

294
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.453
Well, as long as they're
not getting any cheap cider

295
00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.687
like in college.

296
00:14:47.687 --> 00:14:50.557
- No, I told him to
get G and T, obviously.

297
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.059
- Good. (laughs)

298
00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:55.562
- Are you two contemplating
how much is it gonna cost me?

299
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:56.796
- Nothing, Mom.

300
00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.365
- I know what you two are like.

301
00:14:58.365 --> 00:14:59.599
What are you scheming?

302
00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:00.968
- No, I just, I
think we're gonna

303
00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.202
watch some films with
Sally, aren't we?

304
00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:03.703
She's gonna be around.

305
00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.138
- [Di] What movie?

306
00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:08.708
- It's like a disaster
movie about fire tornadoes.

307
00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:09.943
- You know, when I was your age,

308
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:12.379
we'd usually have to be
drunk before we could

309
00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:14.814
watch a silly movie
about a killer doll.

310
00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:19.352
Then we scared ourselves so
much that we couldn't sleep.

311
00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:22.755
- Creepy dolls are so the
early noughties. (chuckles)

312
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.491
- Who's had all the milk?

313
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.325
- Dad.
- Dad.

314
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.561
- Black tea it is then.

315
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.233
When we're gone, right, no
boys, no parties, no boozing,

316
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:34.667
but for a couple of
beers in the fridge,

317
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.003
and that's your limit, ladies.

318
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:36.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:37.670
- Thanks, Mom.

320
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.474
She still thinks we're
kids, doesn't she?

321
00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:44.011
- But don't tell her
because she'll parent.

322
00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.245
(sisters laughing)

323
00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:47.014
- Kiss a slice?

324
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:49.816
Right, please tell me
that your mother's ready.

325
00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:50.984
- No.
- Ngh-ngh.

326
00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:52.519
- Look, I wanna get away soon.

327
00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.688
I wanna get off before those
bloody storm clouds come in.

328
00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.158
So what are you two doing today?

329
00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:00.160
- Just movies with Sally.

330
00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:08.135
- Look, get yourselves some
drinks or something, aye, girls?

331
00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.536
Have a nice time.

332
00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:10.703
- Oh.
- Bye.

333
00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.205
- Bye.

334
00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:13.673
All right, that should get us
an extra couple of bottles.

335
00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:15.542
- You know, he's still
working on 1980s time.

336
00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.510
Probably could buy
a house with that.

337
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.013
Thank you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

338
00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:22.249
- That's what you get
for being a milk thief.

339
00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:27.554
- Right, so Mom and Dad will
be gone in a couple of hours,

340
00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:29.089
and then we need to get ready

341
00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:30.690
'cause then the boys are coming.

342
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.028
Hey, what is it?

343
00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:35.862
- Nothing.

344
00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:39.766
It's...

345
00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:44.137
It's just like Sean stuff.

346
00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:46.873
- Right, well, you don't need
to feel any pressure, right?

347
00:16:46.873 --> 00:16:49.376
It doesn't have to
be this weekend.

348
00:16:49.376 --> 00:16:50.210
- I know.

349
00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:54.647
It's just with
everything that happened

350
00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.149
with my ex and stuff.

351
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.653
I just, I don't want him to get
like put off me or anything.

352
00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:04.691
- Look, if he does, he's
not worth it, right?

353
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:06.259
But I don't think he will.

354
00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:07.760
- Okay.

355
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.730
- Besides he can take care of
himself for the time being.

356
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.899
Choke his chicken to
his heart's content.

357
00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:14.267
- That's grim.

358
00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.635
(both laughing)

359
00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:18.638
- It is a bit. (laughs)

360
00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:23.643
(somber music)
(birds chirping)

361
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:38.291
- I must have missed it.

362
00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:42.495
I think it might
rain soon, you know.

363
00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:44.631
Did you hear about the
thunder om the news?

364
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:47.700
- Yeah, that's why we're going
to Meg's for the weekend.

365
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.803
We'll be fine here
until the bus comes.

366
00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.439
- Yeah, but how long?

367
00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:55.208
- An hour.

368
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:57.444
- I know, we'll
get an early start.

369
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.948
(both chuckling)

370
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.787
Promise me something.

371
00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:10.190
- What?

372
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.958
- No silly, drunken dancing.

373
00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:14.927
- When have I ever
drunken danced?

374
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.265
- Uh, my sister's wedding, prom.

375
00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:20.567
Literally every single
night at student union.

376
00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:23.503
- Okay, fine, point taken.

377
00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:30.177
(somber music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

378
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.746
- Thunder really freaks me out.

379
00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:36.749
(suspenseful music)

380
00:18:41.254 --> 00:18:42.722
- Bloody hell, love.

381
00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:45.358
You turn the water mains off
before you pulled the sink out?

382
00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:47.994
- Very funny, could you help?

383
00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:49.262
- Don't worry, girls.

384
00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:50.697
We'll be back.

385
00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:52.899
Even though your mum's
packing off for a migration.

386
00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.301
- Yeah, you paid the mortgage
off though, aren't you?

387
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.935
We'll be fine.

388
00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.270
- Did you hear that, Di?

389
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.838
That's our little 'un that is.

390
00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:00.607
- Dad, I'm not a kid!

391
00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:04.076
- Oh, you'll always
be my baby. (laughs)

392
00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.512
- Okay.

393
00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:08.581
- If there's anything you
need, all right, I've got this.

394
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:09.849
My fifth limb.

395
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:11.518
So don't be thinking
that you can't call.

396
00:19:11.518 --> 00:19:14.153
I can hunt you down
all over the country.

397
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.488
- I'll see you, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.

398
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.156
- Bye, Meg.
- Love you.

399
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:18.258
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad!

400
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:20.760
- See ya!
- Bye.

401
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.196
I wanna beat this storm front.

402
00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:24.197
- Bye!
- Bye!

403
00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:31.704
- All right, so I reckon
we get some drinks,

404
00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:33.473
and we start getting ready.

405
00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:39.879
(rain pouring)
(thunder rumbling)

406
00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:44.016
Sally and Donal are running
late, missed the bus.

407
00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.486
(rain pouring)

408
00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:49.489
(suspenseful music)

409
00:19:55.495 --> 00:19:57.697
(thunder rumbling)

410
00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.433
(water dripping)

411
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.107
(thunder rumbling)

412
00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:15.214
(suspenseful music continues)

413
00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.353
(food slopping)

414
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:28.127
(suspenseful music continues)

415
00:20:31.464 --> 00:20:34.401
(thunder rumbling)

416
00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:40.039
(suspenseful music continues)

417
00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:42.875
(spoon clanging)

418
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.745
(thunder rumbling)

419
00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:52.118
(footsteps tapping)

420
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.224
- Oh forgive me my sins.

421
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:02.194
(thunder rumbling)

422
00:21:03.796 --> 00:21:06.466
(keys jangling)

423
00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:13.005
(door creaking)

424
00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:16.909
Shit.

425
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:19.812
(thunder cracking)

426
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.719
Awake, dear heart, awake.

427
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.022
Thou hast slept well.

428
00:21:31.057 --> 00:21:33.225
(head butting)

429
00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.161
- Help me, help me,
somebody help me!

430
00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:37.830
- Silence, one more word
and I will chide thee!

431
00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:45.071
(thunder rumbling)

432
00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:48.941
Lie there, mine heart.

433
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:50.276
Wipe thine eyes.

434
00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:53.913
Have comfort.

435
00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:03.990
(thunder rumbling)

436
00:22:05.592 --> 00:22:08.327
(spoon clanging)

437
00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:10.963
You will behave tonight.

438
00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:15.802
(thunder cracking)

439
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:20.473
(spoon clanging)

440
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.975
(mouth spits)

441
00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:30.683
- Please, just let me go.

442
00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:32.284
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

443
00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:38.024
- Just a few more
days, then I'll

444
00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:41.093
set you free.

445
00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.562
- Why are you doing this?

446
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:50.169
- (chuckles) Because I can.

447
00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:55.408
- Please.
- No one's gonna stop me.

448
00:22:55.408 --> 00:22:58.377
- Please just let me
go, I'm begging you.

449
00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.849
- Well demanded, wench.

450
00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:07.554
(thunder rumbling)

451
00:23:08.655 --> 00:23:10.657
I want to show you something.

452
00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:13.893
It's very special.

453
00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:20.366
For your eyes only. (chuckles)

454
00:23:35.648 --> 00:23:37.016
- Who are these girls?

455
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:41.120
How, how could you do that?

456
00:23:42.722 --> 00:23:43.823
- It was quite simple.

457
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:49.028
Strangely therapeutic.

458
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.634
It takes great
patience to do my work.

459
00:23:58.237 --> 00:24:02.074
To put a cut precisely
where it needs to be.

460
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.845
- You're a fucking maniac.

461
00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:12.218
(suspenseful music)

462
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:19.559
(prisoner groans)

463
00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:24.564
(muffled screaming)
(thunder cracking)

464
00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:33.039
(suspenseful music continues)
(muffled screaming)

465
00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:36.676
(thunder cracking)

466
00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:42.582
(muffled screaming)

467
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:47.587
(knuckles knocking)

468
00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:58.665
(fist tapping)

469
00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:04.604
- Afternoon, girls.
- Hey.

470
00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:05.605
- Hey.

471
00:25:05.605 --> 00:25:08.875
Hi, how are you?
(lips smacking)

472
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.309
- You two took your time.

473
00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:11.310
- Yeah, well, we
were circling around,

474
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.144
waiting for a green light.

475
00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:13.546
Look what we got.

476
00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.081
- Sally and her boyfriend
are running late.

477
00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:16.683
They couldn't catch the bus, so.

478
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:18.851
- You didn't tell me
we was hanging around

479
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:19.986
with those two, did we?

480
00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:30.229
(bottles clanking)

481
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.867
(hands tapping)

482
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:39.672
(footsteps tapping)

483
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.109
(liquor splashing)

484
00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:44.510
What do you think, they good?

485
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.745
- Yeah, thanks.

486
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.548
- Well.
- Thank you.

487
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:53.285
- Here's to a delightful
weekend in the country.

488
00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:54.654
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

489
00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:03.963
- So when are Donal and Sally
actually gonna get here?

490
00:26:03.963 --> 00:26:05.632
- You know what,
I don't even know.

491
00:26:05.632 --> 00:26:08.067
My phone's been
lighting up as well so.

492
00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:09.368
Can't even get a hold of them.

493
00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:11.671
- Why did you park so far away?

494
00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:13.039
- It's easier to get out.

495
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:17.977
- Sean can't parallel park.

496
00:26:17.977 --> 00:26:21.347
He'll hit anything
and everything he can.

497
00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:25.484
Cars, bikes, people,
small children.

498
00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.087
- Yeah, laugh it up, dickhead.

499
00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.790
How you getting home?

500
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.825
- All right, children, stop it.

501
00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:35.862
- Right, I'd like to
propose a proper toast.

502
00:26:35.862 --> 00:26:37.396
To loved ones and good times.

503
00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:40.499
And to Meg.
- No, what?

504
00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:42.735
- No, seriously, even
though you're the youngest,

505
00:26:42.735 --> 00:26:43.736
you're the the most grounded.

506
00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:46.673
- Okay. (chuckles)

507
00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.207
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

508
00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:54.313
- So you got a jacuzzi?

509
00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:56.949
- Yeah, why?

510
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.450
- You fancy a dip?

511
00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:01.353
- Okay.

512
00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:07.059
(crickets chirping)
(suspenseful music)

513
00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:08.360
- Ugh, no signal.

514
00:27:09.796 --> 00:27:12.899
- Probably because we're in
the middle of nowhere, Donal.

515
00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:15.301
- Maybe the storm's messing
with the connection.

516
00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:21.874
- Jesus, those clouds
are getting really close.

517
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.077
Do you think we're safe here?

518
00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:27.847
(thunder cracking)

519
00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:29.048
- I could feel that one.

520
00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.451
- I'm scared.

521
00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:34.520
- Sure it's nothing
to worry about.

522
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.323
(thunder cracking)

523
00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:38.557
- Are you crazy?
- What?

524
00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:41.928
(suspenseful music continues)

525
00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:44.697
(Sally whimpers)

526
00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:49.802
(wind howling)

527
00:27:49.802 --> 00:27:50.636
(Sally groans)

528
00:27:50.636 --> 00:27:53.706
(lightning striking)

529
00:27:56.442 --> 00:27:58.945
- We have to run, run!

530
00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:03.015
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

531
00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:04.483
- Wait!

532
00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:05.551
- What?

533
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:08.154
- I need to tell you something.

534
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.194
(lightning striking)
(Donal groaning)

535
00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:16.729
- Donal?

536
00:28:16.729 --> 00:28:21.734
(thunder cracks)
(suspenseful music continues)

537
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:27.673
- What time can we check in?

538
00:28:27.673 --> 00:28:29.175
- Any time we get there, love.

539
00:28:30.276 --> 00:28:31.510
- I am excited.

540
00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:34.146
- So am I.

541
00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:36.448
- But...
- What?

542
00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.317
- You bring the massage oils?

543
00:28:38.317 --> 00:28:43.122
- Bernie, get your mind
out of the gutter. (laughs)

544
00:28:43.122 --> 00:28:47.493
Yes, I did, along with the
kitchen sink, you silly sod.

545
00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:49.996
(Di chuckles)

546
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.600
I'm slightly worried.

547
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.936
That storm seems to
be getting aggressive,

548
00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:59.005
and it's getting closer.

549
00:28:59.005 --> 00:29:01.107
- I think we're safe, love.

550
00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:03.910
These modern cars are
lightning proof, I think.

551
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.244
- Lightning proof?

552
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:06.946
They tell you that on
the forecourt, did they?

553
00:29:06.946 --> 00:29:09.348
- No, I think I saw
it on Top Gear once.

554
00:29:10.983 --> 00:29:12.684
- Did you see that?

555
00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:13.519
That....

556
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:17.156
- Hope the rain
doesn't get any worse.

557
00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:19.058
Right-hand wiper
doesn't work very well.

558
00:29:19.058 --> 00:29:21.527
- I keep telling
you to replace it.

559
00:29:21.527 --> 00:29:23.062
- I'll get around to it.

560
00:29:24.163 --> 00:29:26.198
- How are you
enjoying the log cabin

561
00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:27.466
in the garden by the way?

562
00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:29.969
- What cabin?

563
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:33.405
- The one you said you were
going to build five years ago?

564
00:29:33.405 --> 00:29:37.944
I think the last update on that
was, "I'll get round to it."

565
00:29:37.944 --> 00:29:40.179
- You're winding
up me now, dear.

566
00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:45.051
- 25 years and counting,
darling. (chuckles)

567
00:29:45.051 --> 00:29:46.886
(thunder cracking)

568
00:29:46.886 --> 00:29:49.889
(crickets chirping)

569
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.963
- Hey, sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

570
00:29:56.963 --> 00:29:58.397
Yeah.
- Well, you look great.

571
00:29:58.397 --> 00:29:59.231
- Thanks.

572
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:01.300
- Hey.

573
00:30:05.371 --> 00:30:08.474
(thunder rumbling)

574
00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:09.508
- Hmm?

575
00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:10.576
Oh, I'm fine.

576
00:30:12.879 --> 00:30:14.914
I'm just a bit worried
about Donal and Sally

577
00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:17.316
'cause I've not heard
from them, like all night.

578
00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:20.086
- Well, it may be
that their parents

579
00:30:20.086 --> 00:30:21.687
are just being strict to them.

580
00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:22.855
It's been kind of mad
lately, hasn't it?

581
00:30:22.855 --> 00:30:24.924
Like all these streets,
locking them down.

582
00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:27.493
- Yeah, I know, I'm just
worried that they're out there.

583
00:30:27.493 --> 00:30:29.195
They're stuck in the storm.

584
00:30:29.195 --> 00:30:32.098
(thunder cracking)

585
00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:35.902
- Oh shit, that was nearer.

586
00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:40.106
- What, you think we should
just check the weather report?

587
00:30:40.106 --> 00:30:42.574
- No.
- What do you think?

588
00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.842
- I think...

589
00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.111
I don't think we
should be in here.

590
00:30:45.111 --> 00:30:46.412
I think we should get out.

591
00:30:46.412 --> 00:30:48.614
- Just relax, we're here
to have a good time.

592
00:30:48.614 --> 00:30:49.481
- Yeah, just relax.

593
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:50.749
Everything will be okay.

594
00:30:50.749 --> 00:30:52.318
- What if Donal and
Sally are stuck in it?

595
00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:54.853
- Well, then they're gonna get
struck by lightning. (laughs)

596
00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.622
- Paulie, that's not funny.

597
00:30:56.622 --> 00:30:57.856
- [Sean] Well, it
is a little bit.

598
00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:00.059
- I'm gonna go and
check on them anyway.

599
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:02.094
(water splashing)

600
00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:04.997
(thunder rumbling)

601
00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:10.736
(phone beeping)

602
00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:14.840
(phone beeping)

603
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.674
No signal.

604
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.157
(suspenseful music)

605
00:31:31.157 --> 00:31:32.959
(button clicks)

606
00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:35.894
(thunder cracks)

607
00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:39.731
(suspenseful music continues)

608
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.369
(light bulb shatters)
(Meg gasps)

609
00:31:43.369 --> 00:31:47.173
(suspenseful music continues)

610
00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:57.349
- She's just worried about
her friends, that's all.

611
00:31:57.349 --> 00:31:59.451
- Yeah, but she's making a
big thing about going in.

612
00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:01.720
- She's not making a big
thing, just leave her alone.

613
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.490
(thunder rumbles)

614
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.624
Oh shit.

615
00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:06.925
Oh shit, Meg.

616
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:08.260
(Paulie laughs)

617
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.728
Paulie, it's not funny!

618
00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:11.463
- Well, it is a little bit.
- No, it's not!

619
00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:14.733
(Paulie laughs)

620
00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:17.669
(thunder rumbling)

621
00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.440
Are you all right?

622
00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:25.811
- Will Mom and Dad be okay?

623
00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:28.080
- Yeah.

624
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.317
Yeah, they'll be
fine, don't be silly.

625
00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:37.089
Hey, don't be
dramatic now, okay?

626
00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:38.324
That's my job, yeah?

627
00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:40.726
Fine.
- Okay.

628
00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:41.560
- Fine.

629
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.736
(rain pouring)

630
00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:52.638
- Should we find
cover somewhere?

631
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:53.872
- Where?

632
00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:55.607
Look, we're just
under an hour away.

633
00:32:57.143 --> 00:32:59.678
- It's pretty bad out there.

634
00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:02.381
I thought they said it was
fine to be out on the roads.

635
00:33:02.381 --> 00:33:04.350
- Well, technically
they didn't say that.

636
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.952
They actually said, "You
shouldn't leave your house

637
00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:08.554
"unless it's an emergency,

638
00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:10.789
"and you were coming
in from the East."

639
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:12.624
- Maybe we should turn back.

640
00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:14.360
- Look, it's only
supposed to get rough

641
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.294
in a couple more days.

642
00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:16.895
We're almost through this now.

643
00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.530
- Watch the road, love!

644
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.466
Pull up, pull off the road!

645
00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:21.833
(tires screeching)

646
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.936
(lightning striking)

647
00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:28.940
- Shit!
- Watch it!

648
00:33:31.077 --> 00:33:32.578
Ah, quick, Bernie!

649
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.483
(lightning striking)

650
00:33:38.617 --> 00:33:39.851
(tires screeching)

651
00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.853
- Babe, we burst a tire!

652
00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:43.955
(tires screeching)

653
00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:46.992
- Quick, just pull up, pull up!

654
00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:49.895
(thunder rumbling)

655
00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:55.601
We have to move.

656
00:33:55.601 --> 00:33:57.236
Did you see what
happened back there?

657
00:33:57.236 --> 00:33:59.004
Christ almighty.

658
00:33:59.004 --> 00:34:01.207
- I think we're by Riley's farm.

659
00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:04.543
The house is a couple
of fields over.

660
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:06.212
- Okay.

661
00:34:07.513 --> 00:34:10.182
(suspenseful music continues)

662
00:34:10.182 --> 00:34:13.185
(car doors banging)

663
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:15.554
- Bloody tire's blown.

664
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:19.758
- Look, the fields
are out in the open.

665
00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:20.992
It's too dangerous.

666
00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.461
- The tele says it's
better to be out here

667
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:25.030
than under one of these trees
or stuck in this tin box.

668
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.299
- Could we not just
stay in the car?

669
00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:28.567
- Look out, Di!

670
00:34:29.768 --> 00:34:34.506
(lightning striking)
(explosion blasting)

671
00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:38.444
(suspenseful music continues)

672
00:34:38.444 --> 00:34:39.278
- Oh.

673
00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:44.450
(suspenseful music continues)

674
00:34:51.123 --> 00:34:52.258
- Get down.

675
00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:56.094
(suspenseful music continues)

676
00:34:57.996 --> 00:35:00.366
(Di panting)

677
00:35:03.135 --> 00:35:06.037
- What the?
- Jesus Christ, the car.

678
00:35:08.774 --> 00:35:11.076
They shouldn't let anyone
leave their houses.

679
00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:15.514
- Oh my God, there is no signal!

680
00:35:15.514 --> 00:35:16.882
I just want to call the girls.

681
00:35:16.882 --> 00:35:18.917
I can't get a signal.

682
00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:23.189
- Love, there's a house just...

683
00:35:23.189 --> 00:35:25.624
If we get to it first,
we can use their phone.

684
00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:28.126
(thunder cracking)

685
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.228
Oh come, come on.

686
00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:31.197
Come on, love, calm down.

687
00:35:31.197 --> 00:35:33.732
It's gonna be all right.

688
00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:36.134
You got me.
- Yeah.

689
00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:37.203
- We're gonna be all right.

690
00:35:37.203 --> 00:35:38.570
- Yeah.

691
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.406
- Come on.
- Okay.

692
00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:43.409
- Look, you've
always been there.

693
00:35:43.409 --> 00:35:44.776
I don't know what
these things mean.

694
00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:46.545
I forgot my glasses anyway.

695
00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:48.880
(Di laughs)

696
00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:51.016
- Okay, right.

697
00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:54.986
- [Bernie] Let's get to it.

698
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:55.821
- Quick.

699
00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:59.124
It's okay, I've got the map.

700
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:03.995
Look.

701
00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:08.033
Come on, Bernie.

702
00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:15.241
(suspenseful music continues)

703
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:17.008
Bernie, move!

704
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.110
(lightning striking)

705
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.248
(tree cracking)
(leaves rustling)

706
00:36:22.248 --> 00:36:26.084
(suspenseful music continues)

707
00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:31.923
(lightning crackling)

708
00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:37.563
(suspenseful music continues)

709
00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:40.065
(Di whimpers)

710
00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:43.068
No!

711
00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:51.209
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

712
00:37:13.532 --> 00:37:17.869
- It seems to have
subsided a little, I think.

713
00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.471
- Yeah, maybe it's
run it's course.

714
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:22.140
(radio buzzing)

715
00:37:23.342 --> 00:37:25.677
Is there anything
on the radio, man?

716
00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:28.213
- Nothing has changed.

717
00:37:28.213 --> 00:37:30.181
Can we just go back
in the hot tub now?

718
00:37:31.717 --> 00:37:33.452
- I can still see
the clouds above.

719
00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:38.023
Yeah, I can still see some
lightning crackling inside.

720
00:37:38.023 --> 00:37:39.758
- Hope Mom and Dad are okay.

721
00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:44.262
- There's no phone signals,
we're not gonna know anything.

722
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:47.132
Just stop overthinking
it, all right?

723
00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:48.900
- Hey Meg, they'll be fine.

724
00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:53.271
- All right, what do we do?

725
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.710
- Why don't we go back
out to the jacuzzi

726
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.146
and chill the hell out?

727
00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:03.214
It's meant to be a party, guys.

728
00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:04.716
Bunch of sad sacks.

729
00:38:08.487 --> 00:38:13.492
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

730
00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:19.498
(door creaking)

731
00:38:22.868 --> 00:38:25.337
(suspenseful music continues)

732
00:38:25.337 --> 00:38:26.171
- Hello?

733
00:38:28.674 --> 00:38:29.508
Hello?

734
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.080
(door creaking)

735
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.917
(suspenseful music continues)

736
00:38:42.721 --> 00:38:43.555
Hello?

737
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.893
(thunder rumbling)

738
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.165
(Di groans)

739
00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:58.504
(thunder rumbling)

740
00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:03.308
(suspenseful music continues)

741
00:39:03.308 --> 00:39:05.711
- Darling, stop freaking out.

742
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:07.513
- Okay.
- No, it's fine, I'm here.

743
00:39:07.513 --> 00:39:08.714
- Yeah, thanks.

744
00:39:12.484 --> 00:39:17.489
Sorry I don't like give you
what you want sometimes.

745
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.193
It's just, I, like I have
to just take it slow.

746
00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:23.929
- There's no rushing, right?

747
00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:26.565
You know I like you a lot, yeah?

748
00:39:30.669 --> 00:39:32.170
(radio buzzing)

749
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.040
Now we're talking.

750
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.243
- [Radio Host] Reports are
saying this mega lightning storm

751
00:39:38.243 --> 00:39:40.078
is the worst ever recorded.

752
00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:42.948
Vehicles and buildings
have been destroyed.

753
00:39:42.948 --> 00:39:45.617
Old buildings like listed
buildings, cottages

754
00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:49.521
and farmhouses have been more
susceptible to the damage.

755
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:52.390
One house in Meltonville
was completely destroyed

756
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.092
with lightning
causing severe damage

757
00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:56.261
and triggering a house fire.

758
00:39:57.529 --> 00:39:59.765
(phone ringing)
- Oh my God.

759
00:39:59.765 --> 00:40:00.599
It's my Mom.

760
00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:02.000
Mom, Mom?

761
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.669
Mom?
- Meg, I'm fine.

762
00:40:06.705 --> 00:40:07.539
All right?

763
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:10.175
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

764
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.618
I'm at the windmill
cottage, Southeast.

765
00:40:19.618 --> 00:40:21.352
- What are you doing there?

766
00:40:22.788 --> 00:40:26.024
- There was an
accident, on the road.

767
00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:32.297
- Mom, are you okay?

768
00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:36.234
- I'm fine, I'm fine, all right?

769
00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:37.969
I'm still a little shaken.

770
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.973
Look, I'll check back
in with you later.

771
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:43.374
Are you girls all right?

772
00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:44.676
- Yeah, we're fine.

773
00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:46.077
Now I'm gonna come, I'm
gonna come and get you.

774
00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:49.114
- No, it's dangerous.

775
00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:51.583
- No, I'm gonna come and
get you and Dad now, okay?

776
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:53.752
Send me the address.

777
00:40:53.752 --> 00:40:55.386
- Just leave it.

778
00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:59.491
Meg, listen to me for
once in your life, okay?

779
00:40:59.491 --> 00:41:03.428
It is not safe to be out
on the roads, all right?

780
00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:05.931
I'll call back on you later.

781
00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:07.733
- I love you.

782
00:41:07.733 --> 00:41:08.934
- Love you too.

783
00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:12.337
(phone beeps)

784
00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:15.040
- Will you take me to
go find my mom and dad?

785
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.441
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:18.209
- They've been in an
accident and we need to go.

787
00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:19.978
- Okay, yeah.
- We need to go now.

788
00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:22.013
(rain pouring)

789
00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:22.848
Corin.
(Corin laughs)

790
00:41:22.848 --> 00:41:23.882
Corin.

791
00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:25.517
Corin, Corin!

792
00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:26.718
- What?
- Listen to me.

793
00:41:27.919 --> 00:41:29.688
Mom and dad have been
in an accident, okay?

794
00:41:29.688 --> 00:41:31.156
- What?

795
00:41:31.156 --> 00:41:35.293
- It's all right, they're fine,
but I need you to stay here.

796
00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:38.730
Be safe and I'm gonna
go get Mom, okay?

797
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.565
Just stay there.

798
00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:42.100
- Right, okay.

799
00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:47.806
- I, what do I say?

800
00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:53.011
- Okay, I told her.

801
00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:55.647
Can you get the car
ready for me please?

802
00:41:55.647 --> 00:41:58.550
(thunder rumbling)

803
00:41:59.618 --> 00:42:01.920
I don't think we're safe her.

804
00:42:03.922 --> 00:42:05.256
I'll go get her.

805
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.996
- Hope they're okay.

806
00:42:10.996 --> 00:42:15.166
- But in the mean time, we've
got the hot tub to ourselves.

807
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:19.270
- I don't know, I feel like
I should go check on her.

808
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.538
- Oh, it doesn't
matter what's going on

809
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:21.607
with your weird sister
right now, it's fine.

810
00:42:21.607 --> 00:42:22.841
- Don't call her weird.

811
00:42:22.841 --> 00:42:24.475
- She's causing a
lot of drama tonight.

812
00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:25.977
- Yeah, well, she's
been through a lot.

813
00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:27.445
You don't know half of it, okay?

814
00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:29.147
- Well, how would I know what's
going on with her, Corin?

815
00:42:29.147 --> 00:42:32.751
(thunder rumbling)

816
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:34.019
- Paulie, get out.

817
00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:35.120
- It's just the lightning.

818
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.788
- Paulie, that's getting close.

819
00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:38.523
Paulie, get out now.

820
00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:40.558
Paulie, get out of
the tub, Paulie!

821
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:45.563
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

822
00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:50.335
(Corin screams)

823
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:56.541
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

824
00:42:58.176 --> 00:43:01.579
(water splashing)

825
00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.515
(thunder rumbling)

826
00:43:07.853 --> 00:43:11.690
(suspenseful music continues)

827
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:14.025
- Hello?

828
00:43:17.796 --> 00:43:20.699
(thunder rumbling)

829
00:43:26.905 --> 00:43:30.175
(steps creaking softly)

830
00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:31.009
Hello?

831
00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:38.149
(thunder cracking)

832
00:43:39.751 --> 00:43:40.952
- Paulie?

833
00:43:40.952 --> 00:43:42.087
(Corin cries)

834
00:43:42.087 --> 00:43:43.288
- Paulie!

835
00:43:43.288 --> 00:43:45.323
- What is it?
- We're gonna die!

836
00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:46.858
We're all gonna die!

837
00:43:46.858 --> 00:43:47.993
- Corin, look at me, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

838
00:43:47.993 --> 00:43:49.861
It's okay, it's okay.
- Paulie!

839
00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:51.763
- No, you need to calm down.

840
00:43:51.763 --> 00:43:52.630
Calm down.

841
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.765
Calm down, look at me.

842
00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:54.766
Calm down.

843
00:43:54.766 --> 00:43:56.034
Calm down, okay?

844
00:43:56.034 --> 00:43:57.502
Okay, it's gonna be all right.

845
00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:00.739
We're gonna make a plan,
we're gonna make a plan.

846
00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:03.141
(Corin whimpers)

847
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.210
It's okay, it's okay.

848
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.544
- [Sean] Go, go, go!

849
00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.445
Go, go, go!

850
00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:10.882
(suspenseful music continues)

851
00:44:10.882 --> 00:44:15.887
(thunder cracking)
(lightning striking)

852
00:44:18.623 --> 00:44:20.158
- Oh my God.

853
00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:22.193
- Right, this place is
gonna cave any second.

854
00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:24.830
(Corin whimpering)
(thunder rumbling)

855
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.733
(ceiling cracking)

856
00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:29.735
- Okay.

857
00:44:29.735 --> 00:44:31.369
We gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

858
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:32.470
- We gotta go.

859
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:33.705
- Go.
- Come on.

860
00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.774
(suspenseful music)

861
00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:36.775
Come on, this way.

862
00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:38.676
(thunder cracking)

863
00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.145
- Wait.
- What?

864
00:44:40.145 --> 00:44:42.748
- I've noticed usually
before the ground strikes,

865
00:44:42.748 --> 00:44:44.415
which comes in flurries,

866
00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:47.452
there's some kind of
like build up lightning,

867
00:44:47.452 --> 00:44:48.954
all right, in the clouds.

868
00:44:48.954 --> 00:44:50.756
And it seems to build up
before it hits the ground.

869
00:44:50.756 --> 00:44:52.257
- Right, and you think
we've got a warning?

870
00:44:52.257 --> 00:44:53.725
(thunder cracking)

871
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:56.661
- So that's like the last
surge has passed or something.

872
00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:58.529
- Well, literally
it's clear over there.

873
00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.031
There's nothing in in
the clouds, let's go.

874
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:01.532
- Oh, so we should
go that way then.

875
00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.168
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
get your parents first.

876
00:45:03.168 --> 00:45:05.937
And then once we got
them, we get the fuck out

877
00:45:05.937 --> 00:45:07.238
of this danger zone, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

878
00:45:07.238 --> 00:45:09.307
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

879
00:45:09.307 --> 00:45:12.143
(suspenseful music continues)

880
00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:13.611
- He's dead!

881
00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:15.747
He's dead, we've
gotta get inside!

882
00:45:15.747 --> 00:45:17.115
- Sally!
- Sally, come here!

883
00:45:17.115 --> 00:45:18.283
- Get in the car!
- Sally, get in the car now!

884
00:45:18.283 --> 00:45:19.417
- Sally, get in the car!
- Sally!

885
00:45:19.417 --> 00:45:20.651
- Sally, come over here!

886
00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:23.221
Come over here!
(thunder cracking)

887
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:26.157
(sparks crackling)

888
00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:28.159
(Corin screaming)

889
00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:30.461
- Sally, no!
- Sally!

890
00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:33.198
- We've gotta go,
we've gotta go!

891
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:35.233
- Sally.

892
00:45:37.335 --> 00:45:40.238
(thunder cracking)

893
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:47.578
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

894
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.056
(thunder cracking)

895
00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:06.998
- Any luck yet?

896
00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:09.901
- No, I can't get any signal.

897
00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:12.470
I'll try, no, I'll
call the police after.

898
00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.306
It's just not working.

899
00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:20.311
- Oh my God, Sally! (cries)

900
00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:22.981
How can this be happening, Meg?

901
00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:25.851
- Paulie, was he...

902
00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:29.120
Paulie, was he definitely dead?

903
00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.622
(Corin cries)

904
00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.227
- Can you call his parents?

905
00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:37.762
Can you call his parents?

906
00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:38.997
After you call the police,
can you call his parents?

907
00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:40.531
They need to know!
- Okay.

908
00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:41.732
- No, they need to know!

909
00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:47.438
- Okay.

910
00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.242
(thunder rumbling)

911
00:46:52.177 --> 00:46:54.145
I can drive if you want me to.

912
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:57.348
- No, no, I'm clear, I'm good.

913
00:46:57.348 --> 00:46:58.183
I'm good.

914
00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:02.053
(thunder rumbling)

915
00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:03.554
You know we're driving right
into the eye of this storm.

916
00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:05.223
- Yeah, I know, but we just
need to go and get my parents

917
00:47:05.223 --> 00:47:06.858
and just pick them up and then
we can get out of here, okay?

918
00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:08.193
Just focus on that.

919
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.496
(thunder rumbling)

920
00:47:11.496 --> 00:47:14.165
- The storm's gotta be at
like 10 miles at least.

921
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:15.700
I reckon we just, we
just get them both,

922
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.503
and we just get out
the danger zone, okay?

923
00:47:19.604 --> 00:47:20.438
Yeah?

924
00:47:21.907 --> 00:47:24.242
- I heard reports last week,
and they said the lightning

925
00:47:24.242 --> 00:47:25.676
was knocking out electronics.

926
00:47:27.112 --> 00:47:30.181
Depending on the proximity,
it's working like an EMP.

927
00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:34.485
This is bullshit, man.

928
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:39.590
(thunder rumbling)

929
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.060
(prisoner groans)

930
00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.294
- Please help me.

931
00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:44.695
Can you please get
me out of here?

932
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:45.496
Okay.

933
00:47:48.233 --> 00:47:52.904
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

934
00:47:52.904 --> 00:47:54.372
- By Providence Divine,

935
00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:57.909
how on earth did
you wind up in here?

936
00:47:57.909 --> 00:47:59.710
- Please, don't.

937
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.981
- I should be pinched to death.

938
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:04.415
- Put away the knife.

939
00:48:04.415 --> 00:48:06.217
- I have to be careful.

940
00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:08.853
I've already been attacked
by one intruder tonight.

941
00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:11.122
- He's lying, you're lying!

942
00:48:11.122 --> 00:48:15.660
(suspenseful music continues)

943
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:19.230
- The lightning, we
have to get out of here.

944
00:48:20.365 --> 00:48:23.034
- Do you not want to
be struck by lightning?

945
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:25.870
- My husband died
in this tonight.

946
00:48:27.272 --> 00:48:30.875
- You really don't need to
worry about lightning anymore.

947
00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:32.243
- What, why?

948
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:35.013
- I mean, you were trespassing.

949
00:48:35.013 --> 00:48:37.115
It was self-defense.

950
00:48:37.115 --> 00:48:39.884
(suspenseful music continues)

951
00:48:39.884 --> 00:48:42.954
- Run, get out of
here, get out of here!

952
00:48:44.189 --> 00:48:46.091
- How didst thou escape?

953
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:49.060
(thunder rumbling)

954
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.897
(suspenseful music continues)

955
00:48:56.434 --> 00:48:59.337
(thunder cracking)

956
00:49:09.214 --> 00:49:11.882
I do smell of horse kiss.

957
00:49:17.522 --> 00:49:20.425
(thunder rumbling)

958
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:30.035
(door creaking)
(thunder cracking)

959
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.744
(suspenseful music continues)

960
00:49:39.744 --> 00:49:41.079
Oh, woe the day.

961
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.716
(thunder cracking)

962
00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:50.721
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

963
00:50:09.107 --> 00:50:12.009
(prisoner panting)

964
00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:19.584
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

965
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.041
(kidnapper grunts)
(prisoner groans)

966
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.810
(kidnapper laughs)

967
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.679
(kidnapper groans)

968
00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:52.383
(suspenseful music continues)

969
00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:53.184
Oh.

970
00:51:03.594 --> 00:51:05.130
- It's so weird.

971
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.632
Like no one being on the road.

972
00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:12.036
- How did this happen?

973
00:51:12.036 --> 00:51:14.205
I mean, what's causing it?

974
00:51:15.473 --> 00:51:18.476
- Mother Nature fighting back.

975
00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:23.481
- Yeah, Dad mentioned this
story yesterday in the paper.

976
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:27.418
- What's the story?

977
00:51:29.154 --> 00:51:32.623
- It was a theory about
one of the storms,

978
00:51:32.623 --> 00:51:37.328
that the lightning
tunes to the current

979
00:51:37.328 --> 00:51:38.863
of the human body or something.

980
00:51:41.166 --> 00:51:42.633
- That sounds impossible.

981
00:51:42.633 --> 00:51:44.269
- Yeah, people have been struck

982
00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:47.104
by lightning a lot more
recently, haven't they?

983
00:51:48.873 --> 00:51:50.841
- I mean, it's the
second storm in days.

984
00:51:53.778 --> 00:51:54.879
What if this is our time?

985
00:51:56.214 --> 00:51:57.548
- It just felt a lot
worse than what we've

986
00:51:57.548 --> 00:51:59.217
been experiencing until now.

987
00:52:00.418 --> 00:52:01.219
- I hope not.

988
00:52:02.487 --> 00:52:04.155
- Sorry about Paulie.

989
00:52:06.891 --> 00:52:08.759
- I should have got
him out of there.

990
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:13.498
Should have got
him out of there.

991
00:52:13.498 --> 00:52:16.501
I should not, I should
have got him out of there.

992
00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:17.868
- [Corin] Sean.

993
00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:20.471
It was a freak of
nature, all right?

994
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.540
- No, I should, I should
have got him out of there!

995
00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.610
I should have got
him out of there!

996
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.611
(thunder rumbling)

997
00:52:26.611 --> 00:52:27.945
- Paulie's dead!

998
00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:32.082
(Corin cries softly)

999
00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:35.820
I don't think it's
safe to drive anymore.

1000
00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:38.956
We should...

1001
00:52:38.956 --> 00:52:42.593
We should head out on
foot on the backfields.

1002
00:52:45.563 --> 00:52:46.397
- Okay.

1003
00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:56.774
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

1004
00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:04.782
(prisoner panting)

1005
00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:10.655
(prisoner groaning)

1006
00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:18.463
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner panting)

1007
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:24.369
(kidnapper imitating
animal hooting)

1008
00:53:24.369 --> 00:53:27.438
(kidnapper laughing)

1009
00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:35.179
(thunder rumbling)

1010
00:53:35.179 --> 00:53:36.381
(suspenseful music continues)

1011
00:53:36.381 --> 00:53:40.184
(kidnapper imitating
animal hooting)

1012
00:53:40.184 --> 00:53:44.021
(kidnapper laughing)

1013
00:53:44.021 --> 00:53:49.026
(prisoner grunting)
(kidnapper groaning)

1014
00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:54.265
(footsteps thudding)

1015
00:53:54.265 --> 00:53:59.270
- Damn!
(hand thudding)

1016
00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:06.143
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner groaning)

1017
00:54:08.679 --> 00:54:11.582
(prisoner panting)

1018
00:54:18.323 --> 00:54:23.328
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder cracking)

1019
00:54:28.966 --> 00:54:29.800
- Alas.

1020
00:54:31.068 --> 00:54:33.170
The storm has come again.

1021
00:54:39.544 --> 00:54:41.746
These are not natural events.

1022
00:54:42.947 --> 00:54:45.616
They strengthen from
strange to stranger.

1023
00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:53.123
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

1024
00:54:59.397 --> 00:55:00.731
All lost to prayers.

1025
00:55:03.868 --> 00:55:05.269
To prayers all lost.

1026
00:55:05.269 --> 00:55:08.339
(lightning striking)

1027
00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:23.754
And so the elements
we free! (laughs)

1028
00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:32.196
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder rumbling)

1029
00:55:35.933 --> 00:55:38.503
Let them all be hunted soundly.

1030
00:55:40.538 --> 00:55:43.474
(thunder rumbling)

1031
00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.415
(lightning crackling)

1032
00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:54.184
(thunder cracking)

1033
00:56:00.491 --> 00:56:03.127
(Corin panting)

1034
00:56:05.229 --> 00:56:06.063
- No.

1035
00:56:06.063 --> 00:56:07.898
It's the birds I think.

1036
00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:10.835
(thunder rumbling)

1037
00:56:15.573 --> 00:56:20.578
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1038
00:56:22.547 --> 00:56:23.581
(Corin cries)

1039
00:56:23.581 --> 00:56:24.849
No.

1040
00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:27.184
- What is it?
- Meg, just don't look, okay?

1041
00:56:27.184 --> 00:56:29.487
- What is it, who is it?
- Just stay over there, okay?

1042
00:56:29.487 --> 00:56:30.988
- What is it?
- No!

1043
00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:36.627
(suspenseful music continues)

1044
00:56:38.929 --> 00:56:39.764
He's dead!

1045
00:56:40.598 --> 00:56:44.101
(sisters crying)

1046
00:56:44.101 --> 00:56:45.636
- No.

1047
00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:47.304
Mom.

1048
00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:48.138
Mom?

1049
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.239
Mom!

1050
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:53.611
Mom, Mom! (cries)

1051
00:56:53.611 --> 00:56:54.712
- Oh no, Dad.

1052
00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:57.915
- Mom!

1053
00:56:57.915 --> 00:57:01.786
Mom! (cries)

1054
00:57:03.554 --> 00:57:04.388
Mom!

1055
00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:06.757
No.
- Meg, Meg.

1056
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:08.993
- I need to find my mom.
- Meg!

1057
00:57:08.993 --> 00:57:10.995
- I need to find my mom.

1058
00:57:13.063 --> 00:57:14.298
She said...

1059
00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:16.467
She said she was in a
house and they left her.

1060
00:57:16.467 --> 00:57:18.969
She mustn't go out there,
she mustn't go out there.

1061
00:57:18.969 --> 00:57:20.370
Something must have
happened to her!

1062
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.305
- I know, I know.

1063
00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:22.573
You said it sounded weird.

1064
00:57:22.573 --> 00:57:23.841
But we just need
to find the house

1065
00:57:23.841 --> 00:57:25.710
and she might be in there.

1066
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:30.380
- Yeah, okay. (cries)

1067
00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:38.623
(thunder cracking)

1068
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:43.060
(lightning striking)
- Meg!

1069
00:57:46.864 --> 00:57:47.698
- Meg?

1070
00:57:51.502 --> 00:57:53.137
Sean!

1071
00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:55.840
(thunder cracking)

1072
00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.811
Where are you? (whimpers)

1073
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:09.587
- You know you are not
going to get away with this.

1074
00:58:10.755 --> 00:58:12.256
- Oh, the heavens.

1075
00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:17.562
(suspenseful music continues)

1076
00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:25.135
(Di groans)

1077
00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:27.638
That's what all the girls say.

1078
00:58:30.274 --> 00:58:32.610
(Di groans)

1079
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:39.817
(thunder cracking)

1080
00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:45.422
(footsteps thudding)

1081
00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:52.029
(thunder cracking)
(suspenseful music)

1082
00:59:00.805 --> 00:59:02.339
(footsteps thudding)

1083
00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:03.273
- Meg, Meg?

1084
00:59:04.575 --> 00:59:06.243
Meg, oh my God, Meg.

1085
00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:08.478
Are you okay?

1086
00:59:09.346 --> 00:59:10.180
- Sean?

1087
00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:12.883
Where's Sean?

1088
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:14.819
Where's Sean?

1089
00:59:14.819 --> 00:59:15.653
Sean?

1090
00:59:16.821 --> 00:59:18.689
- He didn't make it.

1091
00:59:18.689 --> 00:59:20.290
- Sean?

1092
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.125
Sean!

1093
00:59:23.193 --> 00:59:24.028
Sean.

1094
00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:25.896
Sean!

1095
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:30.567
Sean! (cries)

1096
00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:34.404
Sean, Sean, Sean,
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean.

1097
00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:35.873
Sean, no!

1098
00:59:35.873 --> 00:59:38.776
(thunder cracking)

1099
00:59:41.846 --> 00:59:42.680
No.

1100
00:59:45.616 --> 00:59:48.285
No, I can't see him!
- I'm sorry.

1101
00:59:51.355 --> 00:59:56.293
- I can't do this
anymore. (cries)

1102
00:59:56.293 --> 00:59:58.295
I can't do this anymore!

1103
00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.931
I can't, please!

1104
01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:03.634
- It's okay, come here.

1105
01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.671
- I can't do this
anymore, I can't!

1106
01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:11.676
No, I can't. (cries)

1107
01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:16.714
(sisters crying)
(thunder rumbling)

1108
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:17.715
- It's okay.

1109
01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:24.521
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1110
01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.757
(thunder rumbling)

1111
01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:27.591
- Meg.

1112
01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:30.094
Meg.

1113
01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:31.295
- What?

1114
01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.231
- We need, we need
to go find the house.

1115
01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.000
We need to go find Mom, okay?

1116
01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.670
We're gonna go,
we're gonna get Mom.

1117
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.971
- Okay.

1118
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:44.709
- And I need you, I need
you to be strong, okay?

1119
01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:46.643
I need you with me, okay?

1120
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.778
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1121
01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.314
Okay, let's go.

1122
01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:52.717
Yeah?
- Okay.

1123
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.522
(sisters grunting)

1124
01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:02.026
- That's it, that's it.

1125
01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:04.695
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

1126
01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.396
Okay, look.

1127
01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:09.333
That could be the house
that Mom was talking about.

1128
01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.701
Yeah?

1129
01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.669
That could be where Mom is.

1130
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.772
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

1131
01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:18.008
(twigs cracking)

1132
01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.243
Come on.
- Yeah.

1133
01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:25.282
- Okay. (panting)

1134
01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:26.116
- No.

1135
01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:28.986
- Hello?

1136
01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:29.820
We need help.

1137
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.188
- No, no one's in.

1138
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.622
(hand knocking)

1139
01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:35.625
(muffled screaming)

1140
01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.928
No one's in.

1141
01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.764
- We need to find the door.
- They could be gone.

1142
01:01:39.764 --> 01:01:42.767
(muffled screaming)

1143
01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:47.704
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

1144
01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.507
(shovel thudding)

1145
01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:56.480
- She who dies pays all debts.

1146
01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:05.422
(thunder cracking)

1147
01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:13.430
(shovel thumping)

1148
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:18.435
(kidnapper laughing)
(thunder rumbling)

1149
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.807
- [Meg] We can't!

1150
01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:24.241
- Look, we need shelter.

1151
01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.709
And you need to be more warm.

1152
01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:26.944
- Okay.
- All right?

1153
01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:27.978
- Why don't you try again?

1154
01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:30.147
Try the door.
- Okay, okay.

1155
01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.651
- [Meg] Wait, there's a car.

1156
01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.988
- All right, well if someone
comes back while we're

1157
01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:39.489
in there then
we'll just explain.

1158
01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.590
- Okay.
- All right?

1159
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.926
- Just go, just go.
- Come on.

1160
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:48.799
(door creaking)

1161
01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:51.869
- Hello?

1162
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.874
(suspenseful music continues)

1163
01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:04.748
Hello?

1164
01:03:04.748 --> 01:03:07.651
(muffled shouting)

1165
01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:11.388
(Di panting)

1166
01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:18.228
(muffled screaming)

1167
01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:23.200
- We're looking for
shelter from the storm.

1168
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.106
(switch clicking)

1169
01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:29.940
No power.

1170
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.245
- Let's go.

1171
01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:45.222
(muffled screaming)

1172
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.293
What are you doing?

1173
01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:51.595
- [Corin] Finding something
to do you up with.

1174
01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:03.607
(suspenseful music continues)

1175
01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.946
(zipper clattering)

1176
01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.580
Okay, here we go.

1177
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.415
Sorry.

1178
01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:15.685
That's a bit better.

1179
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.623
- Okay.
- Hey, it's magic healing.

1180
01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:22.792
(both chuckling)

1181
01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.194
- Yeah, when I was younger,

1182
01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:30.167
the wounds always seemed
to heal like faster,

1183
01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:32.036
you know, when Dad kissed them.

1184
01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.377
And then when I got
older and he stopped,

1185
01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:47.451
like they just seemed to
hurt a bit more, do you know?

1186
01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:49.853
- Yeah.

1187
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:52.722
Hey.

1188
01:04:58.128 --> 01:04:59.529
I don't know how we do this.

1189
01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:03.000
- The storm?

1190
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.502
- No, I mean, after the storm.

1191
01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.573
I don't think I can.

1192
01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.741
- You can.
- I mean

1193
01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.810
like when the dust
settles and...

1194
01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:17.047
I just think it's
gonna be even harder.

1195
01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:21.986
The reality of what's
happened and...

1196
01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.923
How do we do this?

1197
01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:29.659
- Together.

1198
01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:32.696
Come here.

1199
01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:37.601
- Love you.

1200
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:45.275
(bed creaking)
(Di panting)

1201
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.980
(bowl clanging loudly)

1202
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.617
Shit.

1203
01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:58.188
- Something's off.

1204
01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:00.590
- I don't know.

1205
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.460
(thunder rumbling)

1206
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.463
(muffled screaming)

1207
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.467
What the fuck?

1208
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:14.938
(mouth spitting)

1209
01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:17.374
(Di panting)

1210
01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.621
(Di groaning)

1211
01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.694
(Di panting)

1212
01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:48.738
Hello?

1213
01:06:51.175 --> 01:06:53.843
(Corin panting)

1214
01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:00.950
Is anyone there?

1215
01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:05.855
- What do you think's happening?

1216
01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.893
That he's like hurt or is
it like someone dangerous

1217
01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.061
or something, I don't know.

1218
01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:12.496
What should we do?

1219
01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:14.231
- I bet it's locked.

1220
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.233
Should we go in?

1221
01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:18.001
- I think we should go in.
- Yeah.

1222
01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:21.138
- Jesus, Corin.
- What?

1223
01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.172
- What?

1224
01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:24.007
- I need to open it.

1225
01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:25.409
Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

1226
01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:26.510
Go, go, go, go.

1227
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.045
Go, just go.
- All right, come on.

1228
01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.650
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

1229
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.556
(mallet bangs)
(lock thuds)

1230
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.657
- [Meg] Okay, go.

1231
01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:41.825
- Mom?
- Girls!

1232
01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:46.796
Just fucking help me!
- Oh my God, Mom!

1233
01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.398
- Girls.
- Mom, Mom.

1234
01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.335
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.

1235
01:07:51.335 --> 01:07:53.770
- We need to get out
of here really quickly.

1236
01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:58.342
The guy who owns this
place is fucking crazy.

1237
01:07:58.342 --> 01:07:59.409
He kidnapped me.

1238
01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:03.247
If he finds you here,
he'll kill us all.

1239
01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.817
- How long's he been gone?

1240
01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.986
- Oh, I've got no idea.

1241
01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:11.321
I heard him head out.

1242
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:12.656
I don't know where he is.

1243
01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.658
- All right, well.
- Quick!

1244
01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:15.825
- It's okay.

1245
01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.727
People have been
dying left and right.

1246
01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.729
If he's out there, he
might have been struck.

1247
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:20.664
- Oh, I hope so.

1248
01:08:20.664 --> 01:08:22.432
I want that bastard to die!

1249
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.267
- Yeah, we need to go.

1250
01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.268
Please, just go.

1251
01:08:24.268 --> 01:08:25.202
- I saw a knife.

1252
01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.203
I'm gonna go and grab it, okay?

1253
01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.971
I'll be back.

1254
01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:29.473
- What happened?

1255
01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:32.676
- There was another
woman here before me.

1256
01:08:36.713 --> 01:08:39.649
(thunder rumbling)

1257
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:50.960
(suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

1258
01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:06.843
(door creaking)

1259
01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:10.514
(door bangs softly)

1260
01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:14.351
(suspenseful music continues)

1261
01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:25.028
Then he said he was gonna
replace her with me.

1262
01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.764
He grabbed me from behind.

1263
01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:31.067
He put something over my
face, he knocked me out.

1264
01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.702
And then I woke up
tied up in this room!

1265
01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:36.105
- Mom.
- Thank God you came!

1266
01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:40.710
Oh God. (cries)

1267
01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.379
- It's okay, Mom.

1268
01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:43.213
It's okay.

1269
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.351
- After you, I know.

1270
01:09:49.686 --> 01:09:52.789
He showed me some vile
and horrible pictures.

1271
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:54.424
- Of what?

1272
01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:57.294
- Other girls, here before me.

1273
01:09:57.294 --> 01:10:01.865
I recognized a couple
from posters around town.

1274
01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:05.735
After your father...

1275
01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.071
I...

1276
01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:12.276
- We found his body.

1277
01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:15.512
- I should have told you.

1278
01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:18.748
I'm so sorry, Meg.

1279
01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:19.749
- It's okay.

1280
01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.619
- I just wanted
to keep you safe.

1281
01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:27.424
What happened with your
father was just all so sudden.

1282
01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:30.427
(footsteps tapping)

1283
01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:38.868
- He's here, quick, come on.

1284
01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:41.471
- Please, come on
quick, help me.

1285
01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:43.206
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mom, Mom, Mom.

1286
01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:44.741
Just come with me.

1287
01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:48.545
(suspenseful music continues)

1288
01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:02.892
- Shit.
- What?

1289
01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.763
- I forgot my phone downstairs.

1290
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:10.600
(suspenseful music continues)

1291
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.903
- Mom, what are you doing?

1292
01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.805
- I'll deal with him.
- No!

1293
01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:17.173
- He doesn't know who you are.

1294
01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.744
You need to get out
now, both of you.

1295
01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.746
- No, I think we
should all go together.

1296
01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.950
- We have to get through
him first, okay, yeah?

1297
01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:28.785
- Oh!

1298
01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:32.221
- Oh no, what do we?

1299
01:11:33.457 --> 01:11:34.624
What do we do?

1300
01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:38.194
Let's hide, let's hide.

1301
01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:43.199
(suspenseful music continues)
(stairs creaking)

1302
01:11:54.277 --> 01:11:55.845
(thunder rumbling)

1303
01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.848
(lock rattles)

1304
01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.418
(latch rattles)

1305
01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:07.557
Okay.

1306
01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:12.896
(suspenseful music continues)

1307
01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:20.937
(Di grunts)
(kidnapper groans)

1308
01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.838
- [Di] Run!

1309
01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:28.378
(kidnapper coughs)

1310
01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:32.916
(footsteps thudding)

1311
01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.183
- Wait!

1312
01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.019
We can't just leave her,
we can't just leave her.

1313
01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:36.853
- Oh fuck!

1314
01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:41.991
- Okay, wait, just stop, stop.

1315
01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:43.827
We need to come right back.

1316
01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:47.697
We need to find some way
to protect ourselves, okay?

1317
01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.132
- Meg, Meg.

1318
01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:50.299
- What?
- Look.

1319
01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:53.803
The storm, it's
coming back this way.

1320
01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:54.671
Oh shit.

1321
01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:57.273
(thunder cracking)

1322
01:12:57.273 --> 01:13:00.410
(both gasping)

1323
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.880
- What do we do?

1324
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.550
(Di grunts)

1325
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:11.555
- Hostile spirit. (grunts)

1326
01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:14.123
(mallet bangs)

1327
01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:19.729
(kidnapper grunts)
(Di groans)

1328
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.631
(head butts)

1329
01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.802
(suspenseful music continues)

1330
01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:28.638
(footsteps thudding)

1331
01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.807
It won't be so quick
and painless for you.

1332
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:35.278
I shall flay each
of you in turn.

1333
01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:37.914
(both panting)

1334
01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.182
- Oh fuck.
- Go!

1335
01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.689
Quick, down here.

1336
01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:54.664
(suspenseful music continues)
(kidnapper whistles)

1337
01:14:00.403 --> 01:14:04.774
- If I knew I'd have
guests, I'd have cleaned.

1338
01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.110
The spirit torments me, ugh!

1339
01:14:08.512 --> 01:14:12.716
(suspenseful music continues)

1340
01:14:12.716 --> 01:14:14.350
(floor creaking)

1341
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:17.320
(footsteps thudding)

1342
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.389
(kidnapper whistles)

1343
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.137
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

1344
01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.208
The hour has come.

1345
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.947
You know what I'm
going to enjoy?

1346
01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:50.186
Making you choose who dies first

1347
01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:52.388
and who gets to
watch the suffering.

1348
01:14:53.857 --> 01:14:56.359
The god of thunder
calls to me once again.

1349
01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:01.430
Perhaps he wants a sacrifice.

1350
01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:06.202
(suspenseful music continues)

1351
01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:18.615
It's not enough.

1352
01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:21.985
I'm going to need more blood!

1353
01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:24.287
(Corin screams)

1354
01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:25.789
- Go, go!

1355
01:15:25.789 --> 01:15:29.626
(suspenseful music continues)

1356
01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.362
Stay back.

1357
01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.197
- No.

1358
01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.466
(knife rattles)
- Ow.

1359
01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:42.471
(kidnapper chuckles)
(Corine groans)

1360
01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.207
(lips smacking)

1361
01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:45.441
(kidnapper chuckling)
(head butting)

1362
01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:48.211
(Corin groaning)

1363
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.279
(kidnapper grunts)

1364
01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.248
(Meg grunts)
(shovel smacks)

1365
01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:53.583
(kidnapper groans)

1366
01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:55.551
(kidnapper mutters)

1367
01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.621
- Hag's here, hence!

1368
01:15:57.621 --> 01:15:58.855
(shovel thuds)

1369
01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:01.224
(Meg groans)

1370
01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:09.265
You're feisty, I
like that! (chuckles)

1371
01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.001
(lips smacking)

1372
01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:14.403
(laughs) Give me thy hand.

1373
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.306
I do begin to have
bloody thoughts.

1374
01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:22.245
(Meg groans)
(kidnapper laughs)

1375
01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:25.181
(kidnapper groans)

1376
01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:27.116
(kidnapper coughs)

1377
01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:30.954
(suspenseful music continues)

1378
01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:45.268
(thunder rumbling)
(footsteps tapping)

1379
01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:52.008
(kidnapper grunting)
(thunder cracking)

1380
01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:56.145
(Meg whimpers)

1381
01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:02.819
(thunder rumbling)

1382
01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.656
(suspenseful music continues)

1383
01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:23.339
(Corin groans)

1384
01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:27.176
(suspenseful music continues)

1385
01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:51.367
(Corin groans)

1386
01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:56.372
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1387
01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:07.917
- Mom?

1388
01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:08.752
Mom, Mom!

1389
01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:11.020
Are you okay?

1390
01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.124
- Did you get him?

1391
01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.126
- No, come.

1392
01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.096
Get up for a sec.

1393
01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:22.431
(Di groans)

1394
01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:28.872
(thunder rumbling)

1395
01:18:28.872 --> 01:18:29.939
That will do.

1396
01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:37.480
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1397
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.384
(door rattling)

1398
01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:45.588
(footsteps thudding)

1399
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.262
(footsteps thudding)

1400
01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:55.765
(Meg panting)

1401
01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:02.571
(suspenseful music continues)

1402
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.741
(loud banging)

1403
01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:09.578
(suspenseful music continues)

1404
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.226
- Peek-a-boo, cherub!

1405
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.764
(kidnapper panting)

1406
01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:41.911
(footsteps tapping)

1407
01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:45.681
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

1408
01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:50.686
(footsteps tapping)
(sword scraping)

1409
01:19:56.425 --> 01:19:59.195
(sword scraping)

1410
01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:06.102
(thunder rumbles)
(suspenseful music continues)

1411
01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:19.916
(door slams)

1412
01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.886
(kidnapper laughs)
(Meg groans)

1413
01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:27.123
(suspenseful music continues)

1414
01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.558
Do you like that, cherub, hm?

1415
01:20:35.098 --> 01:20:36.065
Aye?

1416
01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.667
(Meg grunts)

1417
01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.769
(suspenseful music continues)

1418
01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:43.639
You got me good
there, didn't you?

1419
01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.942
Ah, move and I'll slice you.

1420
01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:50.113
(Meg panting)

1421
01:20:50.113 --> 01:20:53.149
You know, my first
girl was a redhead.

1422
01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.753
Can't have been more
than a teenage girl.

1423
01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:01.124
She squealed, she did. (laughs)

1424
01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:02.658
She begged me to let her go.

1425
01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:06.996
I told her she would just
be mine for the weekend,

1426
01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:09.899
and then we'd have to
go back to her daddy.

1427
01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:15.204
I fileted her from ear to
eat before the end of Sunday.

(suspenseful music)
(thunder rumbling)

1433
01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:31.154
- Meg.

1434
01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:34.857
Meg?

1435
01:21:36.059 --> 01:21:38.627
(wind howling)

1436
01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:40.663
Meg.

1437
01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.599
(thunder cracking)

1438
01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.971

(suspenseful music continues)

1443
01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:14.964

1444
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.403
(thunder cracking)

1445
01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:25.341
(suspenseful music continues)

1446
01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:28.044
Can you feel this energy?

1447
01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:31.247
(thunder cracking)

1448
01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.749
- You're crazy, you know that?

1449
01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:38.221
- Crazy people have no
clue what they're doing.

1450
01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:40.389
I'm perfectly sane.

1451
01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:45.328
I just do whatever
makes me feel alive.

1452
01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.931
(wind howling)

1453
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:50.566
- You're a fucking psycho.

1454
01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:55.571
- Good wombs have
formed bad sons.

1455
01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:59.608
- What, what?

1456
01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:01.677
(thunder cracking)

1457
01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:03.179
- Be brave, child.

1458
01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:08.851
We'll see how brave you are
when you meet your maker.

1459
01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:11.354
(thunder cracking)

1460
01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:12.288
I grant it.

1461
01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:14.590
Or he will.

1462
01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:19.662

(thunder cracking)

1466
01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:31.540
- No.

1467
01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:35.278
- You've bored me enough, girl.

1468
01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:38.447
(Meg cries)

1469
01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.916
(thunder cracking)

1470
01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:42.651
- [Corin] No!

1471
01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:46.489
(suspenseful music continues)

1472
01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:49.958

(sisters chattering)

1480
01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:28.764

1481
01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.299
(sisters chattering)
(lightning striking)

1482
01:24:30.299 --> 01:24:31.367
Mom, come on!

1483
01:24:32.368 --> 01:24:33.302
That's it.

1484
01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:34.903
Come on, we need to get out.

1485
01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.240

1487
01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:39.575
Come on, we need to go.

1488
01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:42.044
We need to go now, come on.

1489
01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:44.180
That's it, come on.

1490
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.648
Oh my god!

1491
01:24:45.648 --> 01:24:46.915
All right, we need to get
out, it's coming down.

1492
01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:47.750
Go!

1493
01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:54.723

(suspenseful music continues)

1498
01:25:19.882 --> 01:25:20.883
- It's over.

1499
01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:24.353
- We made it.

1500
01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:28.724
(Corin whimpers)

1501
01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:31.227
- Let's go, let's go.

1502
01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:32.828
- Come on.

1503
01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:34.697

1504
01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:36.199

(crickets chirping)

1508
01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.561
Hi.
- Hey, there.

1509
01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:06.962
- You okay?
- Yes.

1510
01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.999
He would be so proud of you.

1511
01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.769
Your courage that night and
what you did to save me.

1512
01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.172
I have so much to thank you for.

1513
01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:20.142
- [Corin] Meg?

1514
01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:22.545
- Go on, go to your sister.

1515
01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:24.713
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

1516
01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:26.315
(lips smacking)

1517
01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:29.318
(footsteps tapping)

1518
01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:34.923

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.926
(footsteps tapping)

1520
01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.095
- What are you doing?

1521
01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:42.631
- All right, so I've
decided I'm gonna

1522
01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:45.434
paint the ceiling in Dad's
study because it needs it.

1523
01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:49.772
But I'm not sure whether
to use emulsion or gloss.

1524
01:26:49.772 --> 01:26:51.440
- I don't know.

1525
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.741
(both laughing)

1526
01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:56.078
- Well the WiFi's gone
so I can't look it up.

1527
01:26:56.078 --> 01:26:58.180
- Oh, that's weird, I
thought the signal was back.

1528
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.949
- Yeah, it were,
but it's gone again.

1529
01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.651
Might be some like faulty
wiring or something.

1530
01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:05.621
- Or have you even like
read the cons properly?

1531
01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:06.555
'Cause you know
what you're like.

1532
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.357
- Yeah, obviously, you dick.

1533
01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:09.758
(Meg laughs)

1534
01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:12.761
- You know, maybe
emulsion or something.

1535
01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:14.062
- Yeah.

1536
01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:17.666
- Yeah 'cause I
mean gloss is shiny.

1537
01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.235
So do you want shiny walls?

1538
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:22.738
- Shiny!
- Shiny.

1539
01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.440
- I'll pick up my brush and
I'll come help you, huh?

1540
01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.141
- Okay, cool.

1541
01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:28.911
Right, I'll go
with this one then.

1542
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:30.813
- [Radio Announcer] Research
into the lightning storm,

1543
01:27:30.813 --> 01:27:33.916
which struck a few months
ago is still ongoing.

1544
01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:36.885
Dr. Becker addressed a summit
yesterday with his theory

1545
01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:40.856
of electrical charge frequency
within these unique storms.

1546
01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:45.060
"In the far north of Iceland,
in largely uninhabited areas,

1547
01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.763
"these storms have
been more frequent.

1548
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:51.133
"What my research has suggested
is that a particular charge

1549
01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:54.837
"of lightning is drawn to
the small electrical charge

1550
01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:56.739
"found within mammals.

1551
01:27:56.739 --> 01:28:00.443
"Like most storms, the
striking points are random,

1552
01:28:00.443 --> 01:28:02.645
"but during flurries
of lightning,

1553
01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:04.947
"the energy within the
storm begins to hone in

1554
01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:07.750
"to particular striking points.

1555
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:10.619
"These can be satellites,
electricity pylons,

1556
01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:12.988
"but as we have
found, mammals too.

1557
01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:16.325
"This would account for the
significant loss of life

1558
01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:17.893
"in the last storm."

1559
01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:20.696
Dr. Becker had correctly
predicted the last storm,

1560
01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:23.399
the power of which
was unprecedented,

1561
01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:26.301
and which the weather
service has denied.

1562
01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.371
With a lightning storm due
to come across the East

1563
01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:30.673
of England this
afternoon and evening,

1564
01:28:30.673 --> 01:28:32.875
Dr. Becker has made
the same warning.

1565
01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:33.909
We'll have more...

1566
01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:35.110
(static buzzing)

1567
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:37.713
Office has issued an
only Amber alert so far.

1568
01:28:37.713 --> 01:28:40.716
In other news, the Prime
Minister has come under...

1569
01:28:40.716 --> 01:28:41.950
Again...
(static buzzing)

1570
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:43.719
His alleged ties
to Russian Mafia.
