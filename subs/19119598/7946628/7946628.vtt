1
00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:51.577
- Anything?

2
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.213
- Looks a bit treacherous.

3
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:56.809
I think we should
keep on moving.

4
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.842
- Oh, come on.

5
00:00:57.843 --> 00:00:59.764
Where's the daredevil
in you, huh?

6
00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.455
Let's document it.

7
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.040
I can take a few shots.

8
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.692
This is amazing!

9
00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.124
If what they're saying
on the news is correct,

10
00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.416
this could be the biggest
natural disaster in history.

11
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.482
In a matter of days.

12
00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:47.352
- That's why we've
gotta get out of dodge.

13
00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:51.949
- Come on, what's a few photos?

14
00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:55.186
I mean, they just said it
might happen in a few days.

15
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:58.246
- Yeah, and I bet that's what
they said at Pompeii too.

16
00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:04.772
- All right, come on, let's go.

17
00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:09.177
- There's no signal.

18
00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.299
We better get back to
the car where it's safe.

19
00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:24.466
- Ooh, whoa!

20
00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.866
Oh.

21
00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:28.700
Oh shit!

22
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:30.003
- What is it?

23
00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:39.515
Crap!

24
00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:44.844
- Run!

25
00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:08.469
- Go, go, go!

26
00:03:13.284 --> 00:03:15.944
I thought you said it wasn't
supposed to pick up so fast?

27
00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:17.253
- Everything said it wouldn't.

28
00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:19.095
I just don't get it.

29
00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.785
It's not starting.

30
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.937
- Right, come on!

31
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.219
- Get out.

32
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:33.440
Get out now!

33
00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:37.583
- It won't open!

34
00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:38.490
It won't open!

35
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.520
I can't get out!

36
00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:42.039
I can't get out!

37
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:45.896
I can't get out!

38
00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:55.012
- Shit.

39
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.480
Linda, no!

40
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.738
Linda!

41
00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:25.585
The
lightning storm last night

42
00:04:25.586 --> 00:04:27.957
has been described
as a mega storm.

43
00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.500
Dr. Becker, a
researcher at the NSSL,

44
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.382
warns that these storms
could become more commonplace

45
00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:36.694
in the wake of global warming.

46
00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:38.766
Some of his working
theories on these storms

47
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.429
from research of similar
in Iceland have so far

48
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.384
been dismissed by rival experts.

49
00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:48.746
Another storm has been
forecast in the coming days.

50
00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.286
The previous one was
far more aggressive

51
00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:53.102
than experts had believed.

52
00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:56.000
Two people have
been reported dead.

53
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:58.374
Dr. Becker warns that
further storms could

54
00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:02.189
prove unpredictable and potentially
a severe threat to life.

55
00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:24.884
- Come on, come on, answer.

56
00:05:24.885 --> 00:05:26.235
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.

57
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:27.070
You scared the crap out of me.

58
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:28.477
- Didn't mean to startle you.

59
00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.289
- Oh, I just think
it's this storm.

60
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.240
It's gotten me a little shaky.

61
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:34.282
And I seem to have
something wrong with my car,

62
00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:35.663
and I can't get
ahold of my husband

63
00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:37.465
to come out here and fix it.

64
00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:38.846
- I could take a look.

65
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:39.681
- I don't wanna trouble you.

66
00:05:39.682 --> 00:05:42.029
You know, I just live about
10 minutes up the road.

67
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.461
It's just that I can't seem
to get ahold of my husband

68
00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.733
to come out here and
save me.

69
00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:48.725
- What's the matter?

70
00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:49.899
Were there devils here?

71
00:05:51.427 --> 00:05:53.957
Hey, how about I drop
you off on my way home?

72
00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.750
How about that?
- Oh, you know, that's okay.

73
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.963
I appreciate the offer,
but no thank you.

74
00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:00.565
- Well, if it's only 10
minutes away, it's no problem.

75
00:06:00.566 --> 00:06:01.575
- Yeah, you know what?

76
00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:02.686
I'm just gonna wait
for my husband.

77
00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:05.418
I'm gonna try and give him
a call again, actually.

78
00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.339
Thank you though.
- Are you sure?

79
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.924
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

80
00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:10.574
- The air breathes of
honesty and most sweetly.

81
00:07:33.075 --> 00:07:36.986
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, thanks.

82
00:07:36.987 --> 00:07:39.120
- Maybe we'll go out
again some other time.

83
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.411
- You know, I
actually, I had fun.

84
00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:45.512
I'm not usually...

85
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:48.327
Well, usually not into
the adventuring style.

86
00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:50.416
- Yeah, well that's why
we practice indoors.

87
00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.397
Take it outdoors and
then we'll scale over it.

88
00:07:52.398 --> 00:07:53.508
- Shut up.

89
00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.919
- Yeah, we've gotta stay
away from the mountains

90
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.754
near Rough Rock Lake though.

91
00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:56.588
Did you hear about that fellow

92
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:58.074
getting vaporized by lightning?

93
00:07:58.075 --> 00:07:59.336
- Yeah, I read about that.

94
00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:00.921
- That'll shocking.

95
00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:04.313
- Stop it, that's awful.

96
00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:07.563
- Anyways, you and
your sister will be

97
00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:09.151
able to host tomorrow?

98
00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:12.747
- Yeah, and well I text Sally
and Donal, they're coming.

99
00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:14.766
And Michael And
Charlie can't make it.

100
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.294
- Well, Charlie's a twat.

101
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.784
There's no loss there.

102
00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:22.063
- Yeah, my parents will be
leaving I think early afternoon,

103
00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:23.273
so I'll text you.

104
00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:24.711
- Well, me and Paulie
will sort out booze.

105
00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.266
What do you like?

106
00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.222
- Don't do anything too strong.

107
00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:29.640
- Girls' drink.

108
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:30.886
- Right, it's 2022.

109
00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:33.294
You can't say things
like that, you pig.

110
00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.214
- Well, what do you want then?

111
00:08:36.674 --> 00:08:39.593
- Something fruity
or like G and T.

112
00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.323
- You mean like a girl's drink?

113
00:08:42.324 --> 00:08:43.650
- Right, if I didn't
like you so much,

114
00:08:43.651 --> 00:08:44.855
I'd cut your balls off.

115
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.176
- Well.

116
00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.177
- Not.

117
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:53.191
Not here.

118
00:08:53.192 --> 00:08:56.259
Not in the car, like just
get that out of your head.

119
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.787
- You're getting
me so worked up.

120
00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.554
- Not when my parents
are 30 yards away.

121
00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:01.810
- Yeah.

122
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:03.213
You want the moment
to be worth it.

123
00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:04.214
- Yeah.

124
00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:06.599
Thank you.

125
00:09:09.188 --> 00:09:10.759
- For what?

126
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.825
- For being patient and...

127
00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:15.750
- No, don't be silly, it's fine.

128
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.854
Go home, have a cold
shower, sort myself out.

129
00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:24.364
- You're fed up with me.

130
00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:25.445
- Look, I don't...

131
00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:26.884
Despite what Paulie
might say about me,

132
00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:28.225
I'm not a player, all right?

133
00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:29.060
- Okay.

134
00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:30.129
- I'm in there
for the long haul.

135
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.031
I don't wanna ruin
this by rushing it.

136
00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:34.363
You should go inside.

137
00:09:35.234 --> 00:09:36.935
- Yeah, okay.

138
00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:38.540
I'll see you tomorrow.

139
00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:40.770
Hey.

140
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.244
- And we'll keep it PG-13.

141
00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.068
- Okay, bye.

142
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:45.070
- All right.

143
00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:11.333
Kiddo?

144
00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:27.470
- Dad, did you feel that?

145
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.130
- Yeah, they said on the news
to expect some heavy thunder.

146
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.576
They've even told us the
warning stay indoors.

147
00:10:35.577 --> 00:10:37.209
It's a load of crock, isn't it?

148
00:10:39.007 --> 00:10:40.958
Who was in the car?

149
00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.999
- Spanish Inquisition?

150
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.491
- No, it's Mastermind,
Dad's edition.

151
00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:46.492
So?

152
00:10:47.354 --> 00:10:49.068
- Just a friend, whatever.

153
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:51.056
- Mm.

154
00:10:51.948 --> 00:10:52.781
How was uni then?

155
00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:54.289
- Yeah, it's good.

156
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.180
Looks all right.

157
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:58.736
- Look, when your mother
and I go on this weekend,

158
00:10:58.737 --> 00:11:01.014
we don't want any shenanigans.

159
00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:02.846
- Shouldn't it be you
two I'm worried about

160
00:11:02.847 --> 00:11:03.987
causing the shenanigans?

161
00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:06.436
- No, well, but we've got plenty
of experience, haven't we?

162
00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:07.685
And we pay the bills.

163
00:11:07.686 --> 00:11:10.009
I don't wanna come back here
and find this place trashed.

164
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.639
- Okay.

165
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.924
What are you reading?

166
00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:16.687
- Oh, it's a report on the
lightning the other day.

167
00:11:16.688 --> 00:11:20.441
Says that we could be getting
in for more occurrences,

168
00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:22.186
sometimes even more dangerous.

169
00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:25.665
Some
crackpot in here says

170
00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:28.277
that he thinks the
lightning is tuned

171
00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:30.049
to the electric current
in the human body.

172
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.090
- Should you even
be going away then?

173
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.471
If it's that dangerous?

174
00:11:33.472 --> 00:11:35.004
Why can't you just stay here?

175
00:11:36.534 --> 00:11:40.434
- Look, your mother will lose
her shit if we don't go away.

176
00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:43.139
We booked this trip ages ago.

177
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.461
It's a fairly safe journey,

178
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:46.300
and it's only two
hours on the motorway.

179
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:48.964
- I know, I just
don't want you going,

180
00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:50.123
and then the roads
are gonna be closed,

181
00:11:50.124 --> 00:11:52.988
and then you can't find a way
back if something happens.

182
00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:54.429
- Your mother's
not gonna complain

183
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.964
if we get stuck in the resort.

184
00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.559
- Okay.

185
00:11:59.444 --> 00:12:00.708
Just drive safe.

186
00:12:01.666 --> 00:12:03.349
- Oh, Man United lost.

187
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.161
- Dad, you know we
have the internet.

188
00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:07.849
I could have told
you that last night.

189
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.111
- Isn't it passed your bedtime?

190
00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:12.617
- What time is it?

191
00:12:12.618 --> 00:12:14.458
- 10:30.
- 10:30.

192
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.938
Yeah, I'm not 12
anymore, Dad, seriously.

193
00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:18.939
- Avante.

194
00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:22.142
- Love you.

195
00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:23.377
- Love you too.

196
00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:25.716
- Bye.
- Bye, love.

197
00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:07.272
- Thou hast now to
wait 12 winters.

198
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:14.389
Don't you realize no
one's coming for you?

199
00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.713
This is your life now.

200
00:13:20.992 --> 00:13:23.694
They've already stopped
talking about you on the news.

201
00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:26.576
All they're talking
about is this lightning,

202
00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:29.192
and how everyone
has to stay indoors.

203
00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:34.723
They didn't even mention you.

204
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:48.411
Temper and his wizard,
delicate wench.

205
00:13:58.223 --> 00:13:59.574
- You've used all the milk.

206
00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:03.759
Can I have your yogurt then?

207
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.593
- Don't look at me.

208
00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.493
- Oh, you're such a dickhead.

209
00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:10.322
One of them,
but you owe me another.

210
00:14:10.323 --> 00:14:11.763
- Yeah, I'll get
you a luxurious one

211
00:14:11.764 --> 00:14:14.796
with gold sprinkles on top.

212
00:14:14.797 --> 00:14:16.215
- Sounds good.

213
00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:22.096
- That is rank.

214
00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:26.566
It's out of date.

215
00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.048
- Why do you think
I'm having cereal?

216
00:14:28.049 --> 00:14:29.800
- Oh my God, asshole.

217
00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:33.321
- Come, you all set for later?

218
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:34.432
- Yeah.

219
00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:36.774
- Okay, the boys are
definitely coming.

220
00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:37.915
Is Sally and her
boyfriend still coming?

221
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.210
- Yes.

222
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.248
- And what about...

223
00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:42.809
- Oh yeah, Paulie
and Sean said they

224
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:43.798
were gonna do a booze run.

225
00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:44.882
- Okay, okay.

226
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.403
Well, as long as they're
not getting any cheap cider

227
00:14:47.404 --> 00:14:48.658
like in college.

228
00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:51.513
- No, I told him to
get G and T, obviously.

229
00:14:51.514 --> 00:14:53.012
Good.

230
00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:56.531
- Are you two contemplating
how much is it gonna cost me?

231
00:14:56.532 --> 00:14:57.762
- Nothing, Mom.

232
00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.323
- I know what you two are like.

233
00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:00.374
What are you scheming?

234
00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:01.995
- No, I just, I
think we're gonna

235
00:15:01.996 --> 00:15:03.226
watch some films with
Sally, aren't we?

236
00:15:03.227 --> 00:15:04.739
She's gonna be around.

237
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.928
What movie?

238
00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:09.742
- It's like a disaster
movie about fire tornadoes.

239
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:10.973
- You know, when I was your age,

240
00:15:10.974 --> 00:15:13.405
we'd usually have to be
drunk before we could

241
00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:15.841
watch a silly movie
about a killer doll.

242
00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:20.370
Then we scared ourselves so
much that we couldn't sleep.

243
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:23.763
Creepy dolls are so the
early noughties.

244
00:15:23.764 --> 00:15:25.505
- Who's had all the milk?

245
00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:26.506
- Dad.
- Dad.

246
00:15:28.328 --> 00:15:29.592
- Black tea it is then.

247
00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:34.242
When we're gone, right, no
boys, no parties, no boozing,

248
00:15:34.243 --> 00:15:35.683
but for a couple of
beers in the fridge,

249
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.004
and that's your limit, ladies.

250
00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:37.839
- Okay.
- Okay.

251
00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:38.839
- Thanks, Mom.

252
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:42.499
She still thinks we're
kids, doesn't she?

253
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.040
- But don't tell her
because she'll parent.

254
00:15:46.253 --> 00:15:48.028
- Kiss a slice?

255
00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:50.836
Right, please tell me
that your mother's ready.

256
00:15:50.837 --> 00:15:52.002
- No.
- Ngh-ngh.

257
00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:53.451
- Look, I wanna get away soon.

258
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.704
I wanna get off before those
bloody storm clouds come in.

259
00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:59.189
So what are you two doing today?

260
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.178
- Just movies with Sally.

261
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:09.221
- Look, get yourselves some
drinks or something, aye, girls?

262
00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:10.602
Have a nice time.

263
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:11.778
- Oh.
- Bye.

264
00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:12.613
- Bye.

265
00:16:12.614 --> 00:16:14.746
All right, that should get us
an extra couple of bottles.

266
00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:16.607
- You know, he's still
working on 1980s time.

267
00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.587
Probably could buy
a house with that.

268
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:21.082
Thank you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

269
00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:23.335
- That's what you get
for being a milk thief.

270
00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:28.617
- Right, so Mom and Dad will
be gone in a couple of hours,

271
00:16:28.618 --> 00:16:30.149
and then we need to get ready

272
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.751
'cause then the boys are coming.

273
00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:36.114
Hey, what is it?

274
00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.115
- Nothing.

275
00:16:39.468 --> 00:16:40.838
It's...

276
00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:45.221
It's just like Sean stuff.

277
00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:47.953
- Right, well, you don't need
to feel any pressure, right?

278
00:16:47.954 --> 00:16:50.446
It doesn't have to
be this weekend.

279
00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:51.447
- I know.

280
00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.730
It's just with
everything that happened

281
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.209
with my ex and stuff.

282
00:16:58.553 --> 00:17:01.765
I just, I don't want him to get
like put off me or anything.

283
00:17:01.766 --> 00:17:05.818
- Look, if he does, he's
not worth it, right?

284
00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.380
But I don't think he will.

285
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:08.521
- Okay.

286
00:17:08.522 --> 00:17:11.853
- Besides he can take care of
himself for the time being.

287
00:17:11.854 --> 00:17:14.027
Choke his chicken to
his heart's content.

288
00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:15.395
- That's grim.

289
00:17:16.778 --> 00:17:19.778
It is a bit.

290
00:17:37.409 --> 00:17:39.410
- I must have missed it.

291
00:17:41.322 --> 00:17:43.623
I think it might
rain soon, you know.

292
00:17:43.624 --> 00:17:45.752
Did you hear about the
thunder om the news?

293
00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:48.844
- Yeah, that's why we're going
to Meg's for the weekend.

294
00:17:48.845 --> 00:17:51.919
We'll be fine here
until the bus comes.

295
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.562
- Yeah, but how long?

296
00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:56.517
- An hour.

297
00:17:57.573 --> 00:17:58.973
- I know, we'll
get an early start.

298
00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:08.992
Promise me something.

299
00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:11.393
- What?

300
00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:13.138
- No silly, drunken dancing.

301
00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:16.107
- When have I ever
drunken danced?

302
00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:19.470
- Uh, my sister's wedding, prom.

303
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.773
Literally every single
night at student union.

304
00:18:22.683 --> 00:18:24.698
- Okay, fine, point taken.

305
00:18:32.562 --> 00:18:34.943
- Thunder really freaks me out.

306
00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:43.850
- Bloody hell, love.

307
00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:46.552
You turn the water mains off
before you pulled the sink out?

308
00:18:46.553 --> 00:18:49.194
- Very funny, could you help?

309
00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.456
- Don't worry, girls.

310
00:18:50.457 --> 00:18:51.447
We'll be back.

311
00:18:51.448 --> 00:18:54.089
Even though your mum's
packing off for a migration.

312
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.500
- Yeah, you paid the mortgage
off though, aren't you?

313
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.121
We'll be fine.

314
00:18:57.122 --> 00:18:58.442
- Did you hear that, Di?

315
00:18:58.443 --> 00:19:00.036
That's our little 'un that is.

316
00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:01.829
- Dad, I'm not a kid!

317
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.318
Oh, you'll always
be my baby.

318
00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:06.369
- Okay.

319
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.822
- If there's anything you
need, all right, I've got this.

320
00:19:09.823 --> 00:19:10.933
My fifth limb.

321
00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:12.764
So don't be thinking
that you can't call.

322
00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:15.396
I can hunt you down
all over the country.

323
00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:16.747
- I'll see you, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.

324
00:19:16.748 --> 00:19:18.395
- Bye, Meg.
- Love you.

325
00:19:18.396 --> 00:19:19.497
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad!

326
00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:21.998
- See ya!
- Bye.

327
00:19:21.999 --> 00:19:24.451
I wanna beat this storm front.

328
00:19:24.452 --> 00:19:25.453
- Bye!
- Bye!

329
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.936
- All right, so I reckon
we get some drinks,

330
00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:34.706
and we start getting ready.

331
00:19:41.126 --> 00:19:45.264
Sally and Donal are running
late, missed the bus.

332
00:20:57.457 --> 00:20:59.459
- Oh forgive me my sins.

333
00:21:16.896 --> 00:21:18.204
Shit.

334
00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:28.031
Awake, dear heart, awake.

335
00:21:29.499 --> 00:21:31.304
Thou hast slept well.

336
00:21:34.525 --> 00:21:36.451
- Help me, help me,
somebody help me!

337
00:21:36.452 --> 00:21:39.140
- Silence, one more word
and I will chide thee!

338
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:50.185
Lie there, mine heart.

339
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:51.567
Wipe thine eyes.

340
00:21:54.111 --> 00:21:55.194
Have comfort.

341
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:12.318
You will behave tonight.

342
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:32.040
- Please, just let me go.

343
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:33.643
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

344
00:22:36.305 --> 00:22:39.377
- Just a few more
days, then I'll

345
00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:42.429
set you free.

346
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.904
- Why are you doing this?

347
00:22:48.874 --> 00:22:51.530
Because I can.

348
00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:56.708
- Please.
- No one's gonna stop me.

349
00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.727
- Please just let me
go, I'm begging you.

350
00:23:02.096 --> 00:23:04.261
- Well demanded, wench.

351
00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:12.062
I want to show you something.

352
00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:15.310
It's very special.

353
00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:21.760
For your eyes only.

354
00:23:37.045 --> 00:23:38.430
- Who are these girls?

355
00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:42.543
How, how could you do that?

356
00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:45.237
- It was quite simple.

357
00:23:47.524 --> 00:23:50.440
Strangely therapeutic.

358
00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:56.054
It takes great
patience to do my work.

359
00:23:59.602 --> 00:24:03.534
To put a cut precisely
where it needs to be.

360
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.298
- You're a fucking maniac.

361
00:25:04.562 --> 00:25:06.125
- Afternoon, girls.
- Hey.

362
00:25:06.126 --> 00:25:07.120
- Hey.

363
00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:10.411
Hi, how are you?

364
00:25:10.412 --> 00:25:11.827
- You two took your time.

365
00:25:11.828 --> 00:25:12.840
- Yeah, well, we
were circling around,

366
00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:13.675
waiting for a green light.

367
00:25:13.676 --> 00:25:14.900
Look what we got.

368
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:16.607
- Sally and her boyfriend
are running late.

369
00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:18.210
They couldn't catch the bus, so.

370
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:20.361
- You didn't tell me
we was hanging around

371
00:25:20.362 --> 00:25:21.512
with those two, did we?

372
00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:46.012
What do you think, they good?

373
00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:47.264
- Yeah, thanks.

374
00:25:48.892 --> 00:25:51.076
- Well.
- Thank you.

375
00:25:51.077 --> 00:25:54.799
- Here's to a delightful
weekend in the country.

376
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.184
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

377
00:26:01.616 --> 00:26:05.548
- So when are Donal and Sally
actually gonna get here?

378
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:07.200
- You know what,
I don't even know.

379
00:26:07.201 --> 00:26:09.632
My phone's been
lighting up as well so.

380
00:26:09.633 --> 00:26:10.949
Can't even get a hold of them.

381
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.268
- Why did you park so far away?

382
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:14.620
- It's easier to get out.

383
00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:19.540
- Sean can't parallel park.

384
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:22.933
He'll hit anything
and everything he can.

385
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:27.050
Cars, bikes, people,
small children.

386
00:26:28.158 --> 00:26:29.659
- Yeah, laugh it up, dickhead.

387
00:26:30.902 --> 00:26:32.365
How you getting home?

388
00:26:32.366 --> 00:26:34.402
- All right, children, stop it.

389
00:26:34.403 --> 00:26:37.435
- Right, I'd like to
propose a proper toast.

390
00:26:37.436 --> 00:26:38.970
To loved ones and good times.

391
00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:42.059
And to Meg.
- No, what?

392
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.310
- No, seriously, even
though you're the youngest,

393
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:45.302
you're the the most grounded.

394
00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:48.250
Okay.

395
00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:49.786
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

396
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.904
- So you got a jacuzzi?

397
00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.524
- Yeah, why?

398
00:26:58.525 --> 00:27:00.027
- You fancy a dip?

399
00:27:02.156 --> 00:27:03.156
- Okay.

400
00:27:08.685 --> 00:27:09.986
- Ugh, no signal.

401
00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:14.546
- Probably because we're in
the middle of nowhere, Donal.

402
00:27:14.547 --> 00:27:16.949
- Maybe the storm's messing
with the connection.

403
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.527
- Jesus, those clouds
are getting really close.

404
00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:26.697
Do you think we're safe here?

405
00:27:29.469 --> 00:27:30.670
- I could feel that one.

406
00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:34.092
- I'm scared.

407
00:27:34.093 --> 00:27:36.153
- Sure it's nothing
to worry about.

408
00:27:38.952 --> 00:27:40.203
- Are you crazy?
- What?

409
00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.565
- We have to run, run!

410
00:28:04.718 --> 00:28:06.189
- Wait!

411
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.255
- What?

412
00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:09.841
- I need to tell you something.

413
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.419
- Donal?

414
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.363
- What time can we check in?

415
00:28:29.364 --> 00:28:30.865
- Any time we get there, love.

416
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:33.212
- I am excited.

417
00:28:34.208 --> 00:28:35.843
- So am I.

418
00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:38.135
- But...
- What?

419
00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:40.017
- You bring the massage oils?

420
00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:44.818
Bernie, get your mind
out of the gutter.

421
00:28:44.819 --> 00:28:49.196
Yes, I did, along with the
kitchen sink, you silly sod.

422
00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:56.270
I'm slightly worried.

423
00:28:56.271 --> 00:28:58.634
That storm seems to
be getting aggressive,

424
00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:00.707
and it's getting closer.

425
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:02.865
- I think we're safe, love.

426
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.668
These modern cars are
lightning proof, I think.

427
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:06.989
- Lightning proof?

428
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.701
They tell you that on
the forecourt, did they?

429
00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:11.107
- No, I think I saw
it on Top Gear once.

430
00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:14.449
- Did you see that?

431
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.450
That...

432
00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:18.919
- Hope the rain
doesn't get any worse.

433
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.801
Right-hand wiper
doesn't work very well.

434
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:23.263
- I keep telling
you to replace it.

435
00:29:23.264 --> 00:29:24.798
- I'll get around to it.

436
00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:27.947
- How are you
enjoying the log cabin

437
00:29:27.948 --> 00:29:29.208
in the garden by the way?

438
00:29:29.209 --> 00:29:31.729
- What cabin?

439
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.153
- The one you said you were
going to build five years ago?

440
00:29:35.154 --> 00:29:39.686
I think the last update on that
was, "I'll get round to it."

441
00:29:39.687 --> 00:29:41.908
- You're winding
up me now, dear.

442
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:46.790
25 years and counting,
darling.

443
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:58.692
- Hey, sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

444
00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:00.133
Yeah.
- Well, you look great.

445
00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:01.134
- Thanks.

446
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200
- Hey.

447
00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:11.242
- Hmm?

448
00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:12.327
Oh, I'm fine.

449
00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:16.647
I'm just a bit worried
about Donal and Sally

450
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.050
'cause I've not heard
from them, like all night.

451
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.809
- Well, it may be
that their parents

452
00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.433
are just being strict to them.

453
00:30:23.434 --> 00:30:24.574
It's been kind of mad
lately, hasn't it?

454
00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:26.650
Like all these streets,
locking them down.

455
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:29.223
- Yeah, I know, I'm just
worried that they're out there.

456
00:30:29.224 --> 00:30:30.918
They're stuck in the storm.

457
00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:37.623
- Oh shit, that was nearer.

458
00:30:39.227 --> 00:30:41.812
- What, you think we should
just check the weather report?

459
00:30:41.813 --> 00:30:44.287
- No.
- What do you think?

460
00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:45.344
- I think...

461
00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:46.823
I don't think we
should be in here.

462
00:30:46.824 --> 00:30:48.114
I think we should get out.

463
00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:50.305
- Just relax, we're here
to have a good time.

464
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:51.182
- Yeah, just relax.

465
00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.016
Everything will be okay.

466
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:53.895
- What if Donal and
Sally are stuck in it?

467
00:30:53.896 --> 00:30:56.551
Well, then they're gonna get
struck by lightning.

468
00:30:56.552 --> 00:30:58.334
- Paulie, that's not funny.

469
00:30:58.335 --> 00:30:59.169
Well, it
is a little bit.

470
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.754
- I'm gonna go and
check on them anyway.

471
00:31:16.624 --> 00:31:17.624
No signal.

472
00:31:57.097 --> 00:31:59.093
- She's just worried about
her friends, that's all.

473
00:31:59.094 --> 00:32:01.204
- Yeah, but she's making a
big thing about going in.

474
00:32:01.205 --> 00:32:03.569
- She's not making a big
thing, just leave her alone.

475
00:32:06.331 --> 00:32:07.489
Oh shit.

476
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.778
Oh shit, Meg.

477
00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:11.596
Paulie, it's not funny!

478
00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:13.312
- Well, it is a little bit.
- No, it's not!

479
00:32:21.805 --> 00:32:23.306
Are you all right?

480
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:27.673
- Will Mom and Dad be okay?

481
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.662
- Yeah.

482
00:32:29.663 --> 00:32:33.175
Yeah, they'll be
fine, don't be silly.

483
00:32:36.025 --> 00:32:38.936
Hey, don't be
dramatic now, okay?

484
00:32:38.937 --> 00:32:40.191
That's my job, yeah?

485
00:32:41.401 --> 00:32:42.582
Fine.
- Okay.

486
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.583
- Fine.

487
00:32:52.538 --> 00:32:54.459
- Should we find
cover somewhere?

488
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.630
- Where?

489
00:32:55.631 --> 00:32:57.465
Look, we're just
under an hour away.

490
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:01.485
- It's pretty bad out there.

491
00:33:01.486 --> 00:33:04.277
I thought they said it was
fine to be out on the roads.

492
00:33:04.278 --> 00:33:06.259
- Well, technically
they didn't say that.

493
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.848
They actually said, "You
shouldn't leave your house

494
00:33:08.849 --> 00:33:10.469
"unless it's an emergency,

495
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.684
"and you were coming
in from the East."

496
00:33:12.685 --> 00:33:14.546
- Maybe we should turn back.

497
00:33:14.547 --> 00:33:16.266
- Look, it's only
supposed to get rough

498
00:33:16.267 --> 00:33:17.163
in a couple more days.

499
00:33:17.164 --> 00:33:18.809
We're almost through this now.

500
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.452
- Watch the road, love!

501
00:33:20.453 --> 00:33:22.369
Pull up, pull off the road!

502
00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:30.847
- Shit!
- Watch it!

503
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.481
Ah, quick, Bernie!

504
00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:43.750
- Babe, we burst a tire!

505
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.895
- Quick, just pull up, pull up!

506
00:33:55.352 --> 00:33:57.478
We have to move.

507
00:33:57.479 --> 00:33:59.103
Did you see what
happened back there?

508
00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:00.874
Christ almighty.

509
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.190
- I think we're by Riley's farm.

510
00:34:04.658 --> 00:34:06.510
The house is a couple
of fields over.

511
00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:08.357
- Okay.

512
00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:17.512
- Bloody tire's blown.

513
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.712
- Look, the fields
are out in the open.

514
00:34:21.713 --> 00:34:22.823
It's too dangerous.

515
00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.324
- The tele says it's
better to be out here

516
00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:26.996
than under one of these trees
or stuck in this tin box.

517
00:34:26.997 --> 00:34:29.269
- Could we not just
stay in the car?

518
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.521
- Look out, Di!

519
00:34:40.404 --> 00:34:41.404
- Oh.

520
00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:54.212
- Get down.

521
00:35:05.152 --> 00:35:08.071
- What the?
- Jesus Christ, the car.

522
00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:13.118
They shouldn't let anyone
leave their houses.

523
00:35:15.007 --> 00:35:17.528
- Oh my God, there is no signal!

524
00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:18.909
I just want to call the girls.

525
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.954
I can't get a signal.

526
00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:25.220
- Love, there's a house just...

527
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:27.637
If we get to it first,
we can use their phone.

528
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.235
Oh come, come on.

529
00:35:31.236 --> 00:35:33.221
Come on, love, calm down.

530
00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:35.750
It's gonna be all right.

531
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:38.154
You got me.
- Yeah.

532
00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:39.225
- We're gonna be all right.

533
00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:40.604
- Yeah.

534
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:42.435
- Come on.
- Okay.

535
00:35:42.436 --> 00:35:45.423
- Look, you've
always been there.

536
00:35:45.424 --> 00:35:46.808
I don't know what
these things mean.

537
00:35:46.809 --> 00:35:48.548
I forgot my glasses anyway.

538
00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:53.030
- Okay, right.

539
00:35:54.297 --> 00:35:57.012
Let's get to it.

540
00:35:57.013 --> 00:35:58.013
- Quick.

541
00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:01.157
It's okay, I've got the map.

542
00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:06.241
Look.

543
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.114
Come on, Bernie.

544
00:36:17.332 --> 00:36:19.103
Bernie, move!

545
00:36:44.317 --> 00:36:45.317
No!

546
00:37:15.661 --> 00:37:20.012
- It seems to have
subsided a little, I think.

547
00:37:20.013 --> 00:37:21.595
- Yeah, maybe it's
run it's course.

548
00:37:25.261 --> 00:37:27.807
Is there anything
on the radio, man?

549
00:37:27.808 --> 00:37:30.359
- Nothing has changed.

550
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.311
Can we just go back
in the hot tub now?

551
00:37:33.848 --> 00:37:35.599
- I can still see
the clouds above.

552
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:40.164
Yeah, I can still see some
lightning crackling inside.

553
00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:41.892
- Hope Mom and Dad are okay.

554
00:37:43.631 --> 00:37:46.392
- There's no phone signals,
we're not gonna know anything.

555
00:37:46.393 --> 00:37:49.275
Just stop overthinking
it, all right?

556
00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:51.050
- Hey Meg, they'll be fine.

557
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.404
- All right, what do we do?

558
00:37:56.973 --> 00:38:00.834
- Why don't we go back
out to the jacuzzi

559
00:38:00.835 --> 00:38:03.356
and chill the hell out?

560
00:38:03.357 --> 00:38:05.398
It's meant to be a party, guys.

561
00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:06.903
Bunch of sad sacks.

562
00:38:27.523 --> 00:38:28.523
- Hello?

563
00:38:30.853 --> 00:38:31.853
Hello?

564
00:38:44.927 --> 00:38:45.927
Hello?

565
00:39:05.551 --> 00:39:07.970
- Darling, stop freaking out.

566
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:09.772
- Okay.
- No, it's fine, I'm here.

567
00:39:09.773 --> 00:39:10.977
- Yeah, thanks.

568
00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:19.731
Sorry I don't like give you
what you want sometimes.

569
00:39:20.604 --> 00:39:24.437
It's just, I, like I have
to just take it slow.

570
00:39:24.438 --> 00:39:26.169
- There's no rushing, right?

571
00:39:27.221 --> 00:39:28.823
You know I like you a lot, yeah?

572
00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:37.285
Now we're talking.

573
00:39:37.286 --> 00:39:40.487
Reports are
saying this mega lightning storm

574
00:39:40.488 --> 00:39:42.319
is the worst ever recorded.

575
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.201
Vehicles and buildings
have been destroyed.

576
00:39:45.202 --> 00:39:47.853
Old buildings like listed
buildings, cottages

577
00:39:47.854 --> 00:39:51.777
and farmhouses have been more
susceptible to the damage.

578
00:39:51.778 --> 00:39:54.642
One house in Meltonville
was completely destroyed

579
00:39:54.643 --> 00:39:56.332
with lightning
causing severe damage

580
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:58.493
and triggering a house fire.

581
00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:02.008
Oh my God.

582
00:40:02.009 --> 00:40:02.848
It's my Mom.

583
00:40:02.849 --> 00:40:04.247
Mom, Mom?

584
00:40:04.248 --> 00:40:05.916
Mom?
- Meg, I'm fine.

585
00:40:08.938 --> 00:40:09.938
All right?

586
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.418
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

587
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:21.863
I'm at the windmill
cottage, Southeast.

588
00:40:21.864 --> 00:40:23.597
- What are you doing there?

589
00:40:25.015 --> 00:40:28.261
- There was an
accident, on the road.

590
00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:34.540
- Mom, are you okay?

591
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:38.436
- I'm fine, I'm fine, all right?

592
00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:40.211
I'm still a little shaken.

593
00:40:41.859 --> 00:40:44.170
Look, I'll check back
in with you later.

594
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.581
Are you girls all right?

595
00:40:45.582 --> 00:40:46.416
- Yeah, we're fine.

596
00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:48.284
Now I'm gonna come, I'm
gonna come and get you.

597
00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:51.305
- No, it's dangerous.

598
00:40:51.306 --> 00:40:53.801
- No, I'm gonna come and
get you and Dad now, okay?

599
00:40:53.802 --> 00:40:55.940
Send me the address.

600
00:40:55.941 --> 00:40:57.591
- Just leave it.

601
00:40:57.592 --> 00:41:01.675
Meg, listen to me for
once in your life, okay?

602
00:41:01.676 --> 00:41:05.712
It is not safe to be out
on the roads, all right?

603
00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:08.241
I'll call back on you later.

604
00:41:08.242 --> 00:41:10.018
- I love you.

605
00:41:10.019 --> 00:41:11.227
- Love you too.

606
00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:17.348
- Will you take me to
go find my mom and dad?

607
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:18.190
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:20.521
- They've been in an
accident and we need to go.

609
00:41:20.522 --> 00:41:22.273
- Okay, yeah.
- We need to go now.

610
00:41:24.324 --> 00:41:25.157
Corin.

611
00:41:25.158 --> 00:41:26.174
Corin.

612
00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.827
Corin, Corin!

613
00:41:27.828 --> 00:41:29.032
- What?
- Listen to me.

614
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.970
Mom and dad have been
in an accident, okay?

615
00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:33.368
- What?

616
00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:37.575
- It's all right, they're fine,
but I need you to stay here.

617
00:41:37.576 --> 00:41:41.038
Be safe and I'm gonna
go get Mom, okay?

618
00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:42.039
Just stay there.

619
00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:44.384
- Right, okay.

620
00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:50.089
- I, what do I say?

621
00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:55.270
- Okay, I told her.

622
00:41:55.271 --> 00:41:57.905
Can you get the car
ready for me please?

623
00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:04.286
I don't think we're safe her.

624
00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:07.600
I'll go get her.

625
00:42:11.819 --> 00:42:13.147
- Hope they're okay.

626
00:42:13.148 --> 00:42:17.516
- But in the mean time, we've
got the hot tub to ourselves.

627
00:42:19.707 --> 00:42:21.632
- I don't know, I feel like
I should go check on her.

628
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:22.563
- Oh, it doesn't
matter what's going on

629
00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:23.943
with your weird sister
right now, it's fine.

630
00:42:23.944 --> 00:42:25.205
- Don't call her weird.

631
00:42:25.206 --> 00:42:26.820
- She's causing a
lot of drama tonight.

632
00:42:26.821 --> 00:42:28.336
- Yeah, well, she's
been through a lot.

633
00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.813
You don't know half of it, okay?

634
00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:31.497
- Well, how would I know what's
going on with her, Corin?

635
00:42:35.093 --> 00:42:36.381
- Paulie, get out.

636
00:42:36.382 --> 00:42:37.479
- It's just the lightning.

637
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.152
- Paulie, that's getting close.

638
00:42:39.153 --> 00:42:40.891
Paulie, get out now.

639
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.905
Paulie, get out of
the tub, Paulie!

640
00:43:15.618 --> 00:43:16.618
- Hello?

641
00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:33.598
Hello?

642
00:43:42.172 --> 00:43:43.375
- Paulie?

643
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.647
- Paulie!

644
00:43:45.648 --> 00:43:47.727
- What is it?
- We're gonna die!

645
00:43:47.728 --> 00:43:49.003
We're all gonna die!

646
00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:50.401
- Corin, look at me, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

647
00:43:50.402 --> 00:43:52.281
It's okay, it's okay.
- Paulie!

648
00:43:52.282 --> 00:43:54.164
- No, you need to calm down.

649
00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:55.023
Calm down.

650
00:43:55.024 --> 00:43:56.157
Calm down, look at me.

651
00:43:56.158 --> 00:43:57.167
Calm down.

652
00:43:57.168 --> 00:43:58.453
Calm down, okay?

653
00:43:58.454 --> 00:43:59.883
Okay, it's gonna be all right.

654
00:43:59.884 --> 00:44:03.183
We're gonna make a plan,
we're gonna make a plan.

655
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:07.674
It's okay, it's okay.

656
00:44:07.675 --> 00:44:09.007
Go, go, go!

657
00:44:09.008 --> 00:44:10.008
Go, go, go!

658
00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:22.610
- Oh my God.

659
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:24.644
- Right, this place is
gonna cave any second.

660
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.206
- Okay.

661
00:44:32.207 --> 00:44:33.842
We gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

662
00:44:33.843 --> 00:44:34.936
- We gotta go.

663
00:44:34.937 --> 00:44:36.188
- Go.
- Come on.

664
00:44:38.228 --> 00:44:39.236
Come on, this way.

665
00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:42.123
- Wait.
- What?

666
00:44:42.124 --> 00:44:45.195
- I've noticed usually
before the ground strikes,

667
00:44:45.196 --> 00:44:46.880
which comes in flurries,

668
00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:49.925
there's some kind of
like build up lightning,

669
00:44:49.926 --> 00:44:51.246
all right, in the clouds.

670
00:44:51.247 --> 00:44:53.223
And it seems to build up
before it hits the ground.

671
00:44:53.224 --> 00:44:54.709
- Right, and you think
we've got a warning?

672
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:59.115
- So that's like the last
surge has passed or something.

673
00:44:59.116 --> 00:45:00.974
- Well, literally
it's clear over there.

674
00:45:00.975 --> 00:45:02.506
There's nothing in in
the clouds, let's go.

675
00:45:02.507 --> 00:45:03.947
- Oh, so we should
go that way then.

676
00:45:03.948 --> 00:45:05.707
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
get your parents first.

677
00:45:05.708 --> 00:45:08.467
And then once we got
them, we get the fuck out

678
00:45:08.468 --> 00:45:09.777
of this danger zone, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

679
00:45:09.778 --> 00:45:11.822
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

680
00:45:14.682 --> 00:45:16.147
- He's dead!

681
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:18.285
He's dead, we've
gotta get inside!

682
00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:19.530
- Sally!
- Sally, come here!

683
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:20.823
- Get in the car!
- Sally, get in the car now!

684
00:45:20.824 --> 00:45:21.931
- Sally, get in the car!
- Sally!

685
00:45:21.932 --> 00:45:23.144
- Sally, come over here!

686
00:45:23.145 --> 00:45:25.754
Come over here!

687
00:45:30.693 --> 00:45:32.976
- Sally, no!
- Sally!

688
00:45:32.977 --> 00:45:35.729
- We've gotta go,
we've gotta go!

689
00:45:36.925 --> 00:45:37.925
- Sally.

690
00:46:07.908 --> 00:46:09.570
- Any luck yet?

691
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.497
- No, I can't get any signal.

692
00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:15.040
I'll try, no, I'll
call the police after.

693
00:46:16.262 --> 00:46:17.875
It's just not working.

694
00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:22.881
Oh my God, Sally!

695
00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:25.549
How can this be happening, Meg?

696
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:28.435
- Paulie, was he...

697
00:46:29.302 --> 00:46:31.692
Paulie, was he definitely dead?

698
00:46:37.314 --> 00:46:38.819
- Can you call his parents?

699
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.654
Can you call his parents?

700
00:46:39.655 --> 00:46:41.588
After you call the police,
can you call his parents?

701
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:43.114
They need to know!
- Okay.

702
00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:44.316
- No, they need to know!

703
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:50.171
- Okay.

704
00:46:54.746 --> 00:46:56.718
I can drive if you want me to.

705
00:46:56.719 --> 00:46:59.915
- No, no, I'm clear, I'm good.

706
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:00.916
I'm good.

707
00:47:04.168 --> 00:47:06.089
You know we're driving right
into the eye of this storm.

708
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.851
- Yeah, I know, but we just
need to go and get my parents

709
00:47:07.852 --> 00:47:09.514
and just pick them up and then
we can get out of here, okay?

710
00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:10.837
Just focus on that.

711
00:47:14.136 --> 00:47:16.808
- The storm's gotta be at
like 10 miles at least.

712
00:47:16.809 --> 00:47:18.337
I reckon we just, we
just get them both,

713
00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:21.135
and we just get out
the danger zone, okay?

714
00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:23.243
Yeah?

715
00:47:24.345 --> 00:47:26.866
- I heard reports last week,
and they said the lightning

716
00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:28.318
was knocking out electronics.

717
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:32.815
Depending on the proximity,
it's working like an EMP.

718
00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:37.125
This is bullshit, man.

719
00:47:44.702 --> 00:47:45.535
- Please help me.

720
00:47:45.536 --> 00:47:47.313
Can you please get
me out of here?

721
00:47:47.314 --> 00:47:48.314
Okay.

722
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.015
- By Providence Divine,

723
00:47:57.973 --> 00:48:00.524
how on earth did
you wind up in here?

724
00:48:00.525 --> 00:48:02.359
- Please, don't.

725
00:48:03.557 --> 00:48:05.688
- I should be pinched to death.

726
00:48:05.689 --> 00:48:07.099
- Put away the knife.

727
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.901
- I have to be careful.

728
00:48:08.902 --> 00:48:11.543
I've already been attacked
by one intruder tonight.

729
00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:13.826
- He's lying, you're lying!

730
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.936
- The lightning, we
have to get out of here.

731
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.715
- Do you not want to
be struck by lightning?

732
00:48:25.716 --> 00:48:28.571
- My husband died
in this tonight.

733
00:48:29.979 --> 00:48:33.551
- You really don't need to
worry about lightning anymore.

734
00:48:33.552 --> 00:48:34.923
- What, why?

735
00:48:34.924 --> 00:48:37.695
- I mean, you were trespassing.

736
00:48:37.696 --> 00:48:39.800
It was self-defense.

737
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.630
- Run, get out of
here, get out of here!

738
00:48:46.867 --> 00:48:48.774
- How didst thou escape?

739
00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:14.647
I do smell of horse kiss.

740
00:49:42.493 --> 00:49:43.827
Oh, woe the day.

741
00:50:55.099 --> 00:50:56.099
Oh.

742
00:51:06.388 --> 00:51:07.926
- It's so weird.

743
00:51:07.927 --> 00:51:10.429
Like no one being on the road.

744
00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:14.827
- How did this happen?

745
00:51:14.828 --> 00:51:16.997
I mean, what's causing it?

746
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.281
- Mother Nature fighting back.

747
00:51:21.282 --> 00:51:26.286
- Yeah, Dad mentioned this
story yesterday in the paper.

748
00:51:29.259 --> 00:51:30.259
- What's the story?

749
00:51:31.936 --> 00:51:35.413
- It was a theory about
one of the storms,

750
00:51:35.414 --> 00:51:40.117
that the lightning
tunes to the current

751
00:51:40.118 --> 00:51:41.669
of the human body or something.

752
00:51:43.971 --> 00:51:45.408
- That sounds impossible.

753
00:51:45.409 --> 00:51:47.033
- Yeah, people have been struck

754
00:51:47.034 --> 00:51:49.889
by lightning a lot more
recently, haven't they?

755
00:51:51.626 --> 00:51:53.627
- I mean, it's the
second storm in days.

756
00:51:56.552 --> 00:51:57.686
What if this is our time?

757
00:51:58.984 --> 00:52:00.304
- It just felt a lot
worse than what we've

758
00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:02.019
been experiencing until now.

759
00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:04.251
- I hope not.

760
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:07.007
- Sorry about Paulie.

761
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.601
- I should have got
him out of there.

762
00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:16.367
Should have got
him out of there.

763
00:52:16.368 --> 00:52:19.344
I should not, I should
have got him out of there.

764
00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.721
Sean.

765
00:52:20.722 --> 00:52:23.333
It was a freak of
nature, all right?

766
00:52:23.334 --> 00:52:25.381
- No, I should, I should
have got him out of there!

767
00:52:25.382 --> 00:52:28.480
I should have got
him out of there!

768
00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:30.814
- Paulie's dead!

769
00:52:36.633 --> 00:52:38.685
I don't think it's
safe to drive anymore.

770
00:52:39.643 --> 00:52:41.805
We should...

771
00:52:41.806 --> 00:52:45.445
We should head out on
foot on the backfields.

772
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.420
- Okay.

773
00:53:57.177 --> 00:54:02.181
Damn!

774
00:54:31.928 --> 00:54:32.928
- Alas.

775
00:54:34.042 --> 00:54:36.127
The storm has come again.

776
00:54:42.507 --> 00:54:44.725
These are not natural events.

777
00:54:45.653 --> 00:54:48.598
They strengthen from
strange to stranger.

778
00:55:02.346 --> 00:55:03.761
All lost to prayers.

779
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.292
To prayers all lost.

780
00:55:21.765 --> 00:55:26.769
And so the elements
we free!

781
00:55:38.955 --> 00:55:41.540
Let them all be hunted soundly.

782
00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:09.154
- No.

783
00:56:09.155 --> 00:56:10.995
It's the birds I think.

784
00:56:26.652 --> 00:56:27.581
No.

785
00:56:27.582 --> 00:56:30.275
- What is it?
- Meg, just don't look, okay?

786
00:56:30.276 --> 00:56:32.556
- What is it, who is it?
- Just stay over there, okay?

787
00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:34.058
- What is it?
- No!

788
00:56:42.015 --> 00:56:43.015
He's dead!

789
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.709
- No.

790
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.367
Mom.

791
00:56:50.368 --> 00:56:51.202
Mom?

792
00:56:51.203 --> 00:56:52.328
Mom!

793
00:56:52.329 --> 00:56:56.703
Mom, Mom!

794
00:56:56.704 --> 00:56:57.788
- Oh no, Dad.

795
00:56:59.405 --> 00:57:01.002
- Mom!

796
00:57:01.003 --> 00:57:04.924
Mom!

797
00:57:06.693 --> 00:57:07.693
Mom!

798
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.903
No.
- Meg, Meg.

799
00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:12.139
- I need to find my mom.
- Meg!

800
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.141
- I need to find my mom.

801
00:57:16.198 --> 00:57:17.368
She said...

802
00:57:17.369 --> 00:57:19.620
She said she was in a
house and they left her.

803
00:57:19.621 --> 00:57:22.105
She mustn't go out there,
she mustn't go out there.

804
00:57:22.106 --> 00:57:23.526
Something must have
happened to her!

805
00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:24.361
- I know, I know.

806
00:57:24.362 --> 00:57:25.696
You said it sounded weird.

807
00:57:25.697 --> 00:57:26.976
But we just need
to find the house

808
00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:28.864
and she might be in there.

809
00:57:28.865 --> 00:57:33.535
Yeah, okay.

810
00:57:42.609 --> 00:57:46.195
Meg!

811
00:57:49.983 --> 00:57:50.983
- Meg?

812
00:57:54.651 --> 00:57:56.282
Sean!

813
00:57:58.982 --> 00:58:03.986
Where are you?

814
00:58:08.533 --> 00:58:12.786
- You know you are not
going to get away with this.

815
00:58:13.944 --> 00:58:15.445
- Oh, the heavens.

816
00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:30.824
That's what all the girls say.

817
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:06.611
- Meg, Meg?

818
00:59:07.847 --> 00:59:09.515
Meg, oh my God, Meg.

819
00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:11.741
Are you okay?

820
00:59:12.597 --> 00:59:13.597
- Sean?

821
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:16.142
Where's Sean?

822
00:59:16.143 --> 00:59:18.060
Where's Sean?

823
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:19.061
Sean?

824
00:59:20.074 --> 00:59:21.943
- He didn't make it.

825
00:59:21.944 --> 00:59:23.540
- Sean?

826
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:24.541
Sean!

827
00:59:26.431 --> 00:59:27.431
Sean.

828
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.330
Sean!

829
00:59:31.162 --> 00:59:33.803
Sean!

830
00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:37.654
Sean, Sean, Sean,
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean.

831
00:59:37.655 --> 00:59:39.121
Sean, no!

832
00:59:45.079 --> 00:59:46.079
No.

833
00:59:48.878 --> 00:59:51.547
No, I can't see him!
- I'm sorry.

834
00:59:54.606 --> 00:59:59.551
I can't do this
anymore.

835
00:59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.554
I can't do this anymore!

836
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.174
I can't, please!

837
01:00:05.456 --> 01:00:06.887
- It's okay, come here.

838
01:00:06.888 --> 01:00:09.922
- I can't do this
anymore, I can't!

839
01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:14.927
No, I can't.

840
01:00:19.955 --> 01:00:20.956
- It's okay.

841
01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:27.778
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

842
01:00:29.998 --> 01:00:30.998
- Meg.

843
01:00:32.218 --> 01:00:33.329
Meg.

844
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:34.226
- What?

845
01:00:34.227 --> 01:00:37.455
- We need, we need
to go find the house.

846
01:00:37.456 --> 01:00:39.250
We need to go find Mom, okay?

847
01:00:40.809 --> 01:00:42.890
We're gonna go,
we're gonna get Mom.

848
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:43.924
- Okay.

849
01:00:43.925 --> 01:00:47.903
- And I need you, I need
you to be strong, okay?

850
01:00:47.904 --> 01:00:49.858
I need you with me, okay?

851
01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:51.027
- Okay.
- Yeah?

852
01:00:52.193 --> 01:00:53.562
Okay, let's go.

853
01:00:54.969 --> 01:00:55.970
Yeah?
- Okay.

854
01:01:02.734 --> 01:01:05.343
- That's it, that's it.

855
01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:09.712
Okay, look.

856
01:01:09.713 --> 01:01:12.644
That could be the house
that Mom was talking about.

857
01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:13.995
Yeah?

858
01:01:13.996 --> 01:01:15.957
That could be where Mom is.

859
01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:18.074
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

860
01:01:21.296 --> 01:01:22.547
Come on.
- Yeah.

861
01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.565
Okay.

862
01:01:28.566 --> 01:01:29.566
- No.

863
01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.280
- Hello?

864
01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:33.115
We need help.

865
01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:34.488
- No, no one's in.

866
01:01:39.795 --> 01:01:40.960
No one's in.

867
01:01:40.961 --> 01:01:43.070
- We need to find the door.
- They could be gone.

868
01:01:57.713 --> 01:01:59.787
- She who dies pays all debts.

869
01:02:24.015 --> 01:02:26.145
We can't!

870
01:02:26.146 --> 01:02:27.586
- Look, we need shelter.

871
01:02:27.587 --> 01:02:29.060
And you need to be more warm.

872
01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:30.307
- Okay.
- All right?

873
01:02:30.308 --> 01:02:31.342
- Why don't you try again?

874
01:02:31.343 --> 01:02:33.511
Try the door.
- Okay, okay.

875
01:02:35.658 --> 01:02:37.993
Wait, there's a car.

876
01:02:38.884 --> 01:02:41.355
- All right, well if someone
comes back while we're

877
01:02:41.356 --> 01:02:42.839
in there then
we'll just explain.

878
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.711
- Okay.
- All right?

879
01:02:43.712 --> 01:02:45.262
- Just go, just go.
- Come on.

880
01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:55.383
- Hello?

881
01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.149
Hello?

882
01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.606
- We're looking for
shelter from the storm.

883
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.510
No power.

884
01:03:37.732 --> 01:03:38.732
- Let's go.

885
01:03:50.798 --> 01:03:52.692
What are you doing?

886
01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:54.995
Finding something
to do you up with.

887
01:04:12.403 --> 01:04:14.064
Okay, here we go.

888
01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:15.065
Sorry.

889
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.158
That's a bit better.

890
01:04:20.138 --> 01:04:23.095
- Okay.
- Hey, it's magic healing.

891
01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:27.661
- Yeah, when I was younger,

892
01:04:29.729 --> 01:04:33.632
the wounds always seemed
to heal like faster,

893
01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.511
you know, when Dad kissed them.

894
01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:43.848
And then when I got
older and he stopped,

895
01:04:45.913 --> 01:04:50.917
like they just seemed to
hurt a bit more, do you know?

896
01:04:52.475 --> 01:04:53.475
- Yeah.

897
01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:56.348
Hey.

898
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.007
I don't know how we do this.

899
01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:06.537
- The storm?

900
01:05:06.538 --> 01:05:09.040
- No, I mean, after the storm.

901
01:05:10.866 --> 01:05:13.099
I don't think I can.

902
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.279
- You can.
- I mean

903
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.339
like when the dust
settles and...

904
01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:20.565
I just think it's
gonna be even harder.

905
01:05:23.234 --> 01:05:25.509
The reality of what's
happened and...

906
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:30.450
How do we do this?

907
01:05:32.282 --> 01:05:33.282
- Together.

908
01:05:35.381 --> 01:05:36.381
Come here.

909
01:05:40.205 --> 01:05:41.205
- Love you.

910
01:05:56.295 --> 01:05:57.295
Shit.

911
01:06:00.205 --> 01:06:01.706
- Something's off.

912
01:06:02.941 --> 01:06:04.163
- I don't know.

913
01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.054
What the fuck?

914
01:06:51.471 --> 01:06:52.471
Hello?

915
01:07:03.256 --> 01:07:04.590
Is anyone there?

916
01:07:07.602 --> 01:07:09.504
- What do you think's happening?

917
01:07:09.505 --> 01:07:13.550
That he's like hurt or is
it like someone dangerous

918
01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:14.689
or something, I don't know.

919
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.123
What should we do?

920
01:07:16.124 --> 01:07:17.864
- I bet it's locked.

921
01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:19.880
Should we go in?

922
01:07:19.881 --> 01:07:21.633
- I think we should go in.
- Yeah.

923
01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.771
- Jesus, Corin.
- What?

924
01:07:24.772 --> 01:07:25.805
- What?

925
01:07:25.806 --> 01:07:27.646
- I need to open it.

926
01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:29.043
Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

927
01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:29.923
Go, go, go, go.

928
01:07:29.924 --> 01:07:32.676
Go, just go.
- All right, come on.

929
01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:37.300
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

930
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.278
Okay, go.

931
01:07:44.279 --> 01:07:45.447
- Mom?
- Girls!

932
01:07:46.756 --> 01:07:50.437
Just fucking help me!
- Oh my God, Mom!

933
01:07:50.438 --> 01:07:52.022
- Girls.
- Mom, Mom.

934
01:07:53.197 --> 01:07:54.979
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.

935
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.415
- We need to get out
of here really quickly.

936
01:07:58.463 --> 01:08:01.975
The guy who owns this
place is fucking crazy.

937
01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.030
He kidnapped me.

938
01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:06.937
If he finds you here,
he'll kill us all.

939
01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:11.523
- How long's he been gone?

940
01:08:11.524 --> 01:08:13.676
- Oh, I've got no idea.

941
01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.006
I heard him head out.

942
01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:16.357
I don't know where he is.

943
01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.341
- All right, well.
- Quick!

944
01:08:18.342 --> 01:08:19.359
- It's okay.

945
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.431
People have been
dying left and right.

946
01:08:21.432 --> 01:08:23.413
If he's out there, he
might have been struck.

947
01:08:23.414 --> 01:08:24.285
- Oh, I hope so.

948
01:08:24.286 --> 01:08:26.115
I want that bastard to die!

949
01:08:26.116 --> 01:08:26.950
- Yeah, we need to go.

950
01:08:26.951 --> 01:08:27.959
Please, just go.

951
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.793
- I saw a knife.

952
01:08:28.794 --> 01:08:29.908
I'm gonna go and grab it, okay?

953
01:08:29.909 --> 01:08:31.654
I'll be back.

954
01:08:31.655 --> 01:08:33.171
- What happened?

955
01:08:33.172 --> 01:08:36.358
- There was another
woman here before me.

956
01:09:24.947 --> 01:09:28.783
Then he said he was gonna
replace her with me.

957
01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.510
He grabbed me from behind.

958
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:34.813
He put something over my
face, he knocked me out.

959
01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.464
And then I woke up
tied up in this room!

960
01:09:36.465 --> 01:09:39.855
- Mom.
- Thank God you came!

961
01:09:39.856 --> 01:09:44.474
Oh God.

962
01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:46.139
- It's okay, Mom.

963
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.140
It's okay.

964
01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:51.109
- After you, I know.

965
01:09:53.429 --> 01:09:56.521
He showed me some vile
and horrible pictures.

966
01:09:56.522 --> 01:09:58.165
- Of what?

967
01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.037
- Other girls, here before me.

968
01:10:01.038 --> 01:10:05.622
I recognized a couple
from posters around town.

969
01:10:08.351 --> 01:10:09.482
After your father...

970
01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:11.974
I...

971
01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:16.018
- We found his body.

972
01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.254
- I should have told you.

973
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:22.495
I'm so sorry, Meg.

974
01:10:22.496 --> 01:10:23.497
- It's okay.

975
01:10:24.368 --> 01:10:26.369
- I just wanted
to keep you safe.

976
01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:31.150
What happened with your
father was just all so sudden.

977
01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:42.613
- He's here, quick, come on.

978
01:10:43.855 --> 01:10:45.141
- Please, come on
quick, help me.

979
01:10:45.142 --> 01:10:46.905
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mom, Mom, Mom.

980
01:10:46.906 --> 01:10:48.455
Just come with me.

981
01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:06.683
- Shit.
- What?

982
01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:10.570
- I forgot my phone downstairs.

983
01:11:16.061 --> 01:11:17.708
- Mom, what are you doing?

984
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:19.600
- I'll deal with him.
- No!

985
01:11:19.601 --> 01:11:20.981
- He doesn't know who you are.

986
01:11:20.982 --> 01:11:24.540
You need to get out
now, both of you.

987
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:26.543
- No, I think we
should all go together.

988
01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:30.753
- We have to get through
him first, okay, yeah?

989
01:11:31.738 --> 01:11:32.738
- Oh!

990
01:11:34.338 --> 01:11:36.007
- Oh no, what do we?

991
01:11:37.257 --> 01:11:38.425
What do we do?

992
01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.986
Let's hide, let's hide.

993
01:12:10.597 --> 01:12:11.597
Okay.

994
01:12:24.787 --> 01:12:25.787
Run!

995
01:12:36.765 --> 01:12:37.878
- Wait!

996
01:12:37.879 --> 01:12:39.864
We can't just leave her,
we can't just leave her.

997
01:12:39.865 --> 01:12:40.865
- Oh fuck!

998
01:12:42.687 --> 01:12:45.843
- Okay, wait, just stop, stop.

999
01:12:45.844 --> 01:12:47.693
We need to come right back.

1000
01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:51.557
We need to find some way
to protect ourselves, okay?

1001
01:12:51.558 --> 01:12:52.983
- Meg, Meg.

1002
01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:54.152
- What?
- Look.

1003
01:12:54.987 --> 01:12:57.608
The storm, it's
coming back this way.

1004
01:12:57.609 --> 01:12:58.609
Oh shit.

1005
01:13:04.306 --> 01:13:07.791
- What do we do?

1006
01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:15.461
Hostile spirit.

1007
01:13:32.549 --> 01:13:34.720
It won't be so quick
and painless for you.

1008
01:13:35.968 --> 01:13:39.178
I shall flay each
of you in turn.

1009
01:13:41.832 --> 01:13:43.083
- Oh fuck.
- Go!

1010
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:49.587
Quick, down here.

1011
01:14:04.335 --> 01:14:08.752
- If I knew I'd have
guests, I'd have cleaned.

1012
01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:11.088
The spirit torments me, ugh!

1013
01:14:35.154 --> 01:14:38.099
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

1014
01:14:41.989 --> 01:14:43.170
The hour has come.

1015
01:14:45.963 --> 01:14:47.917
You know what I'm
going to enjoy?

1016
01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:54.159
Making you choose who dies first

1017
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.354
and who gets to
watch the suffering.

1018
01:14:57.823 --> 01:15:00.318
The god of thunder
calls to me once again.

1019
01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:05.452
Perhaps he wants a sacrifice.

1020
01:15:22.073 --> 01:15:23.073
It's not enough.

1021
01:15:24.725 --> 01:15:26.027
I'm going to need more blood!

1022
01:15:28.298 --> 01:15:29.803
- Go, go!

1023
01:15:35.924 --> 01:15:37.395
Stay back.

1024
01:15:37.396 --> 01:15:38.396
- No.

1025
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.488
Ow.

1026
01:15:59.577 --> 01:16:01.635
- Hag's here, hence!

1027
01:16:09.072 --> 01:16:13.336
You're feisty, I
like that!

1028
01:16:16.102 --> 01:16:18.473
Give me thy hand.

1029
01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:21.393
I do begin to have
bloody thoughts.

1030
01:18:10.688 --> 01:18:12.131
- Mom?

1031
01:18:12.132 --> 01:18:14.108
Mom, Mom!

1032
01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:15.611
Are you okay?

1033
01:18:18.006 --> 01:18:19.508
- Did you get him?

1034
01:18:20.727 --> 01:18:22.688
- No, come.

1035
01:18:22.713 --> 01:18:24.284
Get up for a sec.

1036
01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:34.408
That will do.

1037
01:19:26.216 --> 01:19:28.094
- Peek-a-boo, cherub!

1038
01:20:31.376 --> 01:20:33.795
Do you like that, cherub, hm?

1039
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.302
Aye?

1040
01:20:44.986 --> 01:20:47.852
You got me good
there, didn't you?

1041
01:20:47.853 --> 01:20:50.188
Ah, move and I'll slice you.

1042
01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:57.375
You know, my first
girl was a redhead.

1043
01:20:59.144 --> 01:21:01.965
Can't have been more
than a teenage girl.

1044
01:21:01.966 --> 01:21:05.415
She squealed, she did.

1045
01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:06.953
She begged me to let her go.

1046
01:21:08.145 --> 01:21:11.303
I told her she would just
be mine for the weekend,

1047
01:21:11.304 --> 01:21:14.206
and then we'd have to
go back to her daddy.

1048
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:19.504
I fileted her from ear to
eat before the end of Sunday.

1049
01:21:34.627 --> 01:21:35.627
- Meg.

1050
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.320
Meg?

1051
01:21:43.964 --> 01:21:44.972
Meg.

1052
01:22:14.314 --> 01:22:19.319
Oh, a Turk.

1053
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:32.411
Can you feel this energy?

1054
01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:38.104
- You're crazy, you know that?

1055
01:22:38.977 --> 01:22:42.580
- Crazy people have no
clue what they're doing.

1056
01:22:43.418 --> 01:22:44.745
I'm perfectly sane.

1057
01:22:46.423 --> 01:22:49.699
I just do whatever
makes me feel alive.

1058
01:22:53.269 --> 01:22:54.923
- You're a fucking psycho.

1059
01:22:56.962 --> 01:22:59.937
- Good wombs have
formed bad sons.

1060
01:23:01.311 --> 01:23:03.951
- What, what?

1061
01:23:06.099 --> 01:23:07.600
- Be brave, child.

1062
01:23:08.952 --> 01:23:13.259
We'll see how brave you are
when you meet your maker.

1063
01:23:15.777 --> 01:23:16.777
I grant it.

1064
01:23:18.097 --> 01:23:19.097
Or he will.

1065
01:23:35.117 --> 01:23:36.117
- No.

1066
01:23:37.538 --> 01:23:39.703
- You've bored me enough, girl.

1067
01:23:45.318 --> 01:23:47.072
No!

1068
01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:54.363
- Time to die!

1069
01:24:31.632 --> 01:24:33.222
- Come on!

1070
01:24:34.754 --> 01:24:35.838
Mom, come on!

1071
01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:37.669
That's it.

1072
01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:39.356
Come on, we need to get out.

1073
01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:44.035
Come on, we need to go.

1074
01:24:44.036 --> 01:24:46.527
We need to go now, come on.

1075
01:24:46.528 --> 01:24:48.640
That's it, come on.

1076
01:24:48.641 --> 01:24:49.662
Oh my god!

1077
01:24:49.663 --> 01:24:51.377
All right, we need to get
out, it's coming down.

1078
01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.378
Go!

1079
01:25:24.418 --> 01:25:25.419
- It's over.

1080
01:25:27.804 --> 01:25:28.888
- We made it.

1081
01:25:33.247 --> 01:25:35.737
- Let's go, let's go.

1082
01:25:35.738 --> 01:25:37.339
- Come on.

1083
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:40.730
- Come on.
- Go on.

1084
01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:10.135
Hi.
- Hey, there.

1085
01:26:10.136 --> 01:26:11.554
- You okay?
- Yes.

1086
01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:15.576
He would be so proud of you.

1087
01:26:15.577 --> 01:26:18.373
Your courage that night and
what you did to save me.

1088
01:26:20.081 --> 01:26:21.766
I have so much to thank you for.

1089
01:26:23.264 --> 01:26:24.722
Meg?

1090
01:26:24.723 --> 01:26:27.121
- Go on, go to your sister.

1091
01:26:27.122 --> 01:26:29.297
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

1092
01:26:43.454 --> 01:26:44.288
- What are you doing?

1093
01:26:44.289 --> 01:26:47.223
- All right, so I've
decided I'm gonna

1094
01:26:47.224 --> 01:26:50.015
paint the ceiling in Dad's
study because it needs it.

1095
01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:54.354
But I'm not sure whether
to use emulsion or gloss.

1096
01:26:54.355 --> 01:26:56.035
- I don't know.

1097
01:26:57.312 --> 01:27:00.660
- Well the WiFi's gone
so I can't look it up.

1098
01:27:00.661 --> 01:27:02.746
- Oh, that's weird, I
thought the signal was back.

1099
01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:05.598
- Yeah, it were,
but it's gone again.

1100
01:27:05.599 --> 01:27:07.303
Might be some like faulty
wiring or something.

1101
01:27:07.304 --> 01:27:10.252
- Or have you even like
read the cons properly?

1102
01:27:10.253 --> 01:27:11.182
'Cause you know
what you're like.

1103
01:27:11.183 --> 01:27:12.985
- Yeah, obviously, you dick.

1104
01:27:14.393 --> 01:27:17.392
- You know, maybe
emulsion or something.

1105
01:27:17.393 --> 01:27:18.689
- Yeah.

1106
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:22.322
- Yeah 'cause I
mean gloss is shiny.

1107
01:27:22.323 --> 01:27:24.868
So do you want shiny walls?

1108
01:27:25.918 --> 01:27:27.390
- Shiny!
- Shiny.

1109
01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:29.078
- I'll pick up my brush and
I'll come help you, huh?

1110
01:27:29.079 --> 01:27:30.789
- Okay, cool.

1111
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:33.549
Right, I'll go
with this one then.

1112
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:35.443
Research
into the lightning storm,

1113
01:27:35.444 --> 01:27:38.566
which struck a few months
ago is still ongoing.

1114
01:27:38.567 --> 01:27:41.508
Dr. Becker addressed a summit
yesterday with his theory

1115
01:27:41.509 --> 01:27:45.478
of electrical charge frequency
within these unique storms.

1116
01:27:45.479 --> 01:27:49.712
"In the far north of Iceland,
in largely uninhabited areas,

1117
01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:52.414
"these storms have
been more frequent.

1118
01:27:52.415 --> 01:27:55.777
"What my research has suggested
is that a particular charge

1119
01:27:55.778 --> 01:27:59.470
"of lightning is drawn to
the small electrical charge

1120
01:27:59.471 --> 01:28:01.362
"found within mammals.

1121
01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:05.126
"Like most storms, the
striking points are random,

1122
01:28:05.127 --> 01:28:07.337
"but during flurries
of lightning,

1123
01:28:07.338 --> 01:28:09.632
"the energy within the
storm begins to hone in

1124
01:28:09.633 --> 01:28:12.441
"to particular striking points.

1125
01:28:12.442 --> 01:28:15.323
"These can be satellites,
electricity pylons,

1126
01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:17.695
"but as we have
found, mammals too.

1127
01:28:17.696 --> 01:28:21.028
"This would account for the
significant loss of life

1128
01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.582
"in the last storm."

1129
01:28:22.583 --> 01:28:25.399
Dr. Becker had correctly
predicted the last storm,

1130
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.096
the power of which
was unprecedented,

1131
01:28:28.097 --> 01:28:30.989
and which the weather
service has denied.

1132
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.080
With a lightning storm due
to come across the East

1133
01:28:33.081 --> 01:28:35.373
of England this
afternoon and evening,

1134
01:28:35.374 --> 01:28:37.565
Dr. Becker has made
the same warning.

1135
01:28:37.566 --> 01:28:38.596
We'll have more...

1136
01:28:39.668 --> 01:28:42.399
Office has issued an
only Amber alert so far.

1137
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.398
In other news, the Prime
Minister has come under...

1138
01:28:45.399 --> 01:28:46.233
Again...

1139
01:28:46.234 --> 01:28:48.399
His alleged ties
to Russian Mafia.

1140
01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.467
- It's back.
