<i>Army Rangers have a proud history.</i>

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:34.117
<i>Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation</i>

4
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.667
<i>You men are a credit to that fine heritage
and I'm sorry to see you go,</i>

5
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.295
<i>but you've served your country well
and displayed the ability to fight on</i>

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.340
<i>to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission,</i>

7
00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:52.803
<i>never leaving behind a fallen comrade,
no matter what the odds or the enemy.</i>

8
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.513
<i>I thank you,</i>

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.932
America thanks you,

11
00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:03.772

- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

146
00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.827
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

147
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.581
I gotta be gettin' my shot before we go
gettin' on some airplane, Guard Bishop.

148
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.166
What's your name?

149
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.877
Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

150
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:13.882
OK, you're diabetic? All right, your insulin's

- Yes, ma'am.

You're under full restraints till you're
released from your prison, understand?

153
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.434
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

- It's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

155
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:31.357

she was born. She ain't never seen me.

156
00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.818
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy

157
00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:37.780
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

158
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.991
and love-starved murderers.

159
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:41.326

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.469
Now, let's go to work.

164
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.138
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest to Feltham.

165
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.390
Good. Let's go deal with the DEA boys.

166
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.188
- Know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

167
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.483
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

168
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.153
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

169
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.657
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

170
00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:22.742
This, this is fucking spectacular!

171
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.162
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

172
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.165
Vince, Duncan Malloy - DEA.

173
00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:33.002
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure we're gonna
have a good time working on this together.

174
00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.272
Hey, Willie. How ya doin'?
You know each other?

175
00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:53.815
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA.

176
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.276
The file on Francisco Cindino,
son of Eduardo,

177
00:12:56.442 --> 00:13:01.030
prime mover of narcotics from Colombia.
It's gonna be an all-star flight.

178
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.741
This kid's a font of information
about the family business.

179
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.952
- 11 and a half OK?
- Yeah.

180
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:10.290
Look at him. Nice college boy, right?
We interrogated him, he gave up nothing.

181
00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.458
This is our last chance
before the FBI gets him.

182
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.044
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

183
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.213
We pick up Mr. Cindino in Carson City.

184
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.550
Till the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

185
00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:24.429
You'll sit next to him. He's known to be
garrulous in the company of thieves.

186
00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.389
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

187
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.892
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

188
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:34.522
- What's with dictionary boy here?
- Thesaurus boy is more appropriate.

189
00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.734
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

190
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.570
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

191
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.990
- Yeah, so do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

192
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:48.411
I've got a small arsenal in the belly of
the plane, a pistol in the cockpit lock box.

193
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.331
That's it. Other than that,
we keep the plane like a prison.

194
00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.416
No weapons on the aircraft, period.

195
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.085
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

196
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.838
Then your man doesn't get on the plane.

197
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.260
OK, Willie, give it to him.

198
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.555
Give him the gun.

199
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.022
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

200
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:20.193
- In the pen it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.

201
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.403
OK.

202
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.949
<i>(man over PA) Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.</i>

203
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.243
<i>Awaiting your go on separatee transfer.</i>

204
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.331
Well, we told you
today's flight would be special.

205
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.917
That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam".

206
00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.543
- The mass murderer?
- The same.

207
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.171
He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

208
00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.299
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

209
00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.635
Killed her parents,
brothers, sisters and dog.

210
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.303
Scan him.

211
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.014
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

212
00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.975
Nathan Jones, aka "Diamond Dog".

213
00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.311
Former general of the Black Guerrillas.

214
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.481
He blew up a meeting of
the National Rifle Association, saying:

215
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.567
"They represented the basest negativity
of the white race."

216
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:05.696
He wrote a book in prison called
<i>Reflections in a Diamond Eye.</i>

217
00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:09.117
<i>New York Times</i> called it
"A wake-up call for the black community."

218
00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:12.954
They're talking to Denzel for the movie.

219
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.756
Close door number one.

220
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.596
This one's done it all -
kidnapping, robbery, murder, extortion.

221
00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:34.142
<i>Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secure.
You are clear to release.</i>

222
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:40.606
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus".

223
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:44.110
39 years old, 25 of them
spent in our institutions.

224
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:48.030
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

225
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:52.827
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

226
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.413
Likes to brag that
he killed more men than cancer.

227
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.250
OK, open wide.
Lift your tongue.

228
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:06.174
Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally
insane. He's a true product of the system.

229
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.303
What's that supposed to mean?
What is he, one of these sociology majors

230
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.805
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

231
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:16.017
No, but I could point a few fingers
if you'd feel comfortable.

232
00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:29.572
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

233
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.657
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

234
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.076
Man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

235
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.412
He told me he loved me.

236
00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.457
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

237
00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:47.006
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

238
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.343
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

239
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.261
OK, let's do it.

240
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:57.767
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

241
00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.521
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

242
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.648
Tell me, Skip,
is the US Marshal Service

243
00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:06.776
in the habit of employing
annoying, wise-ass bookworm creeps?

244
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:08.528
Larkin's one of the best we got.

245
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:13.157
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

246
00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:17.870
Scan him. Face me.

247
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:26.045
- What's this shit?
- It's my daughter.

248
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.382
I don't care if it's the weepin' mama
of Christ. No personal possessions.

249
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.301
Just as long as you know
I'll get that back at some point.

250
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.388
Are you tellin' me what
I'm gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

251
00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.223
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

252
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.351
Come on, break it up.

253
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:47.191
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

254
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.946
- Right here.
<i>- (man over PA) Attention, officers.</i>

255
00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:55.741
<i>- Final check, all restraints.</i>
- Sweet bird of freedom.

256
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.785
<i>Takeoff in three minutes.</i>

257
00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.829
What's up, man?

258
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.123
Oh, shit. What's up?

259
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.667
I thought you were someone else.
Pinball Parker.

260
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.128
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend.

261
00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.338
I'm a hell of a nice guy, I just got caught.

262
00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.674
Aw, shucks.

263
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.890
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

264
00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.476
Come on.

265
00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.730
Open.

266
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.865
You guys are late for the party.

267
00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.618
- OK.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

268
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.500
What's up, Cochise?

269
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.377
How.

270
00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:53.966
I'm just fuckin' with you. Don't get all
Wounded Knee on me and shit.

271
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.012
You look like you wanna scalp a nigga.

272
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:03.142
What you lookin' at, punk?

273
00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:06.687
Nothin'. I was just admirin' your cage.

274
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.315
Fits you pretty good.

275
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.319
Well, welcome aboard.

276
00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.155
My, my. As I look around,
I see a lot of celebrities among us.

277
00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:21.369
I see 11 <i>Current Affair</i> s, two <i>Hard Copy</i> s,
and a genuine <i>Geraldo</i> interviewee.

278
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.788
But I gotta tell you,
none of this impresses me.

279
00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:27.083
We have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

280
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:31.087
It's like kindergarten. Keep your hands
to yourself, keep the decibel level down.

281
00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:35.800
And if any of you should feel the need to
scream, spit or bite, you get the treatment.

282
00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:40.012
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

283
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:44.558
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

284
00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.937
These rules will be enforced.
If there's a hint of trouble,

285
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.314
if any of you so much as
passes gas in my direction,

286
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.233
it offends my delicate nasal passages,

287
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.821
your testicles will become
my personal property.

288
00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:00.658
That's pretty clear. Good.

289
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:02.868
<i>(in Spanish)</i>

290
00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.638
Call me Johnny-600
if they knew the truth.

291
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:26.434
Nah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

292
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.228
Anyway, I despise rapists.

293
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.106
You're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff

294
00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:35.609
that accumulates at the corner in
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

295
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:39.238
But in your case, I'll make an exception.

296
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:42.825
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

297
00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:46.787
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

298
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:48.789
Well, I think you'll like it, Cyrus.

299
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.333
It's <i>I'll Never Make Love
to a Woman on the Beach Again.</i>

300
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.213
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, <i>No More Steak For Me Ever.</i>

301
00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.551
Funny fucker, aren't ya?

302
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.892
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

303
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.019
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

304
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:13.773
The only thing we gotta worry about
is stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

305
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.944
Close forward gate.

306
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.125
Close middle gate.

307
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:23.717
- Come on, I need my shot!
- Coming. I'm coming. Left arm.

308
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:43.571
Hey, Chief, if you come through this
all right, hope you don't hold a grudge.

309
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.407
What the fuck are you doin'?

310
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.579
<i>(screams)</i>

311
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:54.665
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

312
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:58.002
<i>(Pinball)</i> The Last Mohican is burnin', man!

313
00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:02.548
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker, man?
He spontaneously combusted.

314
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.761
He's a fuckin' witch doctor.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

315
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.930
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.

316
00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.141
- Fire in the rear cabin.
- I've got a fire.

317
00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:14.643
- Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.

318
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.769
<i>(alarm blaring)</i>

319
00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:19.440
At first I thought he was singin' "YMCA".
Then the flames.

320
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.025
Shit!

321
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.078
Yeah!

322
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:37.207
Holy shit! Hold on, Bobby!

323
00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:39.376
Gimme a Taser!

324
00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:43.255
Get off my insulin!

325
00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:49.219
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

326
00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:02.650
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

327
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:08.072
Pinball, behind you!

328
00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:14.286
Get the gun out of the lock box, Mack.
Go on back there, check it out.

329
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.634
Go! Go!

330
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.311
<i>(gunshots)</i>

331
00:24:42.606 --> 00:24:43.565
Oh, my God.

332
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.318
Say there was a disturbance,
but it's under control.

333
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.070
Say it, or I will kill you.

334
00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:50.447
Without me,
you got nobody to fly the plane.

335
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:53.450
I never think that far ahead.

336
00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.287
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

337
00:24:57.454 --> 00:24:59.707
And if you say a word about this
over the radio,

338
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:05.212
the next wings you see will belong to
the flies buzzing over your rotting corpse.

339
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.549
Uh, Carson City.

340
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:11.969
Hey! Hey!

341
00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:21.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

342
00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.814
I have the only gun on board.

343
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:26.775
Welcome to Con Air.

344
00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:30.612
<i>(screaming and yelling)</i>

345
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:37.995
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

346
00:25:38.162 --> 00:25:40.789
Calm down. A little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

347
00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:44.460
- Just a little ruckus?
- Pilot just checked in. Everything's fine.

348
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:48.964
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

349
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:51.592
Damn, this pig is heavy!

350
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:54.011
Oops.<i> (laughs)</i>

351
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:58.932
Shit.

352
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.605
- If we let you out, you gonna play nice?
- Probably not.

353
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.822
I got a spot on my arm just for you.

354
00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:17.910
- Hey, man. Get off my medication.
- I'm sorry, man. The shit's in my way.

355
00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:20.996
I'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.

356
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:23.749
All right, man. Stop rushin'.

357
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:31.006
Ah, yeah.

358
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:39.181
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

359
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.436
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

360
00:26:46.396 --> 00:26:48.816
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

361
00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:54.238
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

362
00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.115
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

363
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.659
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

364
00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:01.203
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

365
00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.415
Keep that in mind when you look at her.
If your dick jumps out of your pants,

366
00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:07.709
you jump out of this plane.

367
00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:19.138
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

368
00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:23.058
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

369
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:26.854
Well, I know three of these brothers.
They right back there.

370
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.898
Uh, the other three
are Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

371
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.360
- Where are they?
- That's a damn good question. I'll find out.

372
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.613
The pilot wants to know what's next.

373
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.408
He's to land at Carson City Airport
as scheduled.

374
00:27:39.575 --> 00:27:43.078
Carson City? The law is down there.
You lost your mind?

375
00:27:43.245 --> 00:27:46.707
According to
my last psych evaluation, yes.

376
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:49.835
Diamond Dog, if you would.

377
00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:56.592
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

378
00:27:56.758 --> 00:28:01.930
40 to 50 US prison guards armed with
shotguns are waitin' for us at the next stop.

379
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:04.766
Now, if you do exactly what we tell ya,

380
00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:09.104
the rest of our lives will be
a vacation in a non-extradition country.

381
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:14.193
I'm talkin' sandy beaches, umbrella drinks,

382
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.778
- and dirty, naked freaks.
<i>- (shouting, whistling)</i>

383
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:20.574
It'll be a paid motherfuckin' vacation.

384
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:25.746
- Wait. Who's doin' the payin'?
- Our employer, Francisco Cindino.

385
00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:32.628
Everybody freeze! Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

386
00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:34.713
Get that ass out here right now!

387
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.840
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

388
00:28:37.007 --> 00:28:39.384
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

389
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:43.513
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA, that's who the fuck I am.

390
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.143
- Now, you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

391
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.646
You think I give a shit
about that little bitch guard?

392
00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:54.066
Maybe you didn't hear me. I'm DEA.
You know what the fuck that means?

393
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.401
- You the most crooked nigga here.
- Shut up.

394
00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.322
DEA? What are you doin' on this flight?
Won't they fly you boys commercially?

395
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:03.867
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
I swear I'll blow him away right now.

396
00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:06.995
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield,

397
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:09.831
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

398
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.667
- Hey.
- Shut up.

399
00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:14.544
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

400
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.048
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

401
00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:20.717
- Stay back!
- Just stop before somebody gets killed.

402
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:22.469
Back!

403
00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:24.638
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.
- Stay back!

404
00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:27.641
You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

405
00:29:27.808 --> 00:29:30.394
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

406
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.855
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

407
00:29:54.084 --> 00:29:57.254
What's your name, convict?

408
00:29:57.421 --> 00:30:00.090
- My name?
- Yeah.

409
00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:04.720
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

410
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.520
Nice goin', son.

411
00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:16.315
Not only did you not save this dude's life,

412
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:20.110
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

413
00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:24.072
Hey, Cyrus, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

414
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:25.449
Yeah, what's the good news?

415
00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:28.201
The goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

416
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:30.871
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is,

417
00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:34.041
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

418
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:38.628
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is Carls,

419
00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.548
and this honky he's draggin' in
is Popovitch.

420
00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:46.053
I don't know how to tell you this, Cyrus,
but we are three white guys short,

421
00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:49.181
or as they say in Ebonics,
"We be fucked."

422
00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.768
Look, man, I just wanna know.

423
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:57.397
All right, you didn't... You didn't mean
that dirty-nigger crackhead shit, did you?

424
00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.232
Gimme that gun.

425
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.401
Hell, yes, I meant it.

426
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:05.405
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane

427
00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:08.742
and we'll give 'em exactly what they
expect. So I need three volunteers.

428
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:12.204
Come on. Let's go, son.

429
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.582
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

430
00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:19.169
I'm servin' eight consecutive life
sentences. I won't get off this plane.

431
00:31:19.336 --> 00:31:21.922
I got my insulin,
but they broke all the damn needles.

432
00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:26.301
If I don't get my shot soon,
they'll be sending flowers to my mother.

433
00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:28.261
- I'm too old for this shit.
- No offence.

434
00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:31.932
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

435
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.601
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

436
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:38.688
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

437
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:45.779
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

438
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:47.948
That puts you shit out of luck.

439
00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:49.866
- Come on, man.
- Tell you what. Sit down.

440
00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:52.119
One of my associates
will bring you a phone book,

441
00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:54.287
and you call the Affirmative Action Office.

442
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:57.833
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

443
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:01.586
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

444
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:07.634
I'll get off, scream to high heaven.
This plane won't leave Carson City.

445
00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:12.931
We need another white boy to volunteer.

446
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:18.186
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

447
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:23.316
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

448
00:32:23.483 --> 00:32:25.360
You rang?

449
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:28.530
Carson City says we got
a hell of a sandstorm down there.

450
00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:31.283
Perfect.

451
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.661
Crazy.

452
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:44.463
<i>Vacant cell D8, ready for inspection.</i>

453
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:48.717
Last tenant, Cyrus Grissom.

454
00:32:48.884 --> 00:32:51.845
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably weapon sharpening.

455
00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:55.182
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

456
00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:57.225
Looks like cocaine.

457
00:33:01.688 --> 00:33:05.609
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. It's all soft.

458
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.365
What about the rest of the pigs?

459
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:16.870
Be patient, now.
They haven't ceased to be useful yet.

460
00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:19.581
OK, old man.
Now you're Mr. Popovitch.

461
00:33:19.748 --> 00:33:22.626
Gentlemen, you'll reach
the Nevada pen in about two hours.

462
00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:24.836
The tape's just a little precaution

463
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:30.091
in case any of you are rocked by
the sudden impulse to squeal like a pig.

464
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:34.137
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

465
00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:39.142
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.

466
00:33:39.309 --> 00:33:40.977
What?

467
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.772
I changed my mind.

468
00:33:43.939 --> 00:33:46.399
So, Cyrus, we got a little mind-changer.

469
00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:50.445
I got 15 years left,
and I know I'd just hate myself

470
00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:53.448
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak

471
00:33:53.615 --> 00:33:55.909
and an umbrella drink.

472
00:33:56.076 --> 00:33:59.454
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

473
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:03.208
I know. Fear of freedom, I guess.

474
00:34:06.795 --> 00:34:08.421
Get him up. Get the cuffs off him.

475
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.343
Pick out a guard, and then put
that dead cop's prison issues on him.

476
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:18.056
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.

477
00:34:18.223 --> 00:34:20.976
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

478
00:34:21.142 --> 00:34:24.604
It'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

479
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:28.650
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

480
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:34.281
What would my daughter think of me if I left
you like this to get dishonoured and die?

481
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:37.033
If you act like you're a Ranger,
we'll all be in trouble.

482
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.912
You're not that guy any more.
You're a convict.

483

OK, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

Maybe.

- The Virus.

Hello. How you doin', baby?

Well, this is a restricted area.

Look, don't worry, baby.
It's all right. I'm a cop.

You work for a prison or somethin'?

- Garland Greene.

- Shit, that's Garland Greene, man.
- The Marietta Mangler.

528
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:03.151
That skinny little man
butchered 30-somethin' people

Oh, yeah. It's called a transponder.

00:49:56.577 --> 00:50:00.539
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane,

648
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:04.335
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over,

649
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:09.089
and then somehow managed
to stick us right smack in the middle.

650
00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:18.641
Hi, Garland.

651
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:24.563
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

652
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.359
US Ranger, highly decorated.
A little hell-raising, but nothing serious.

653
00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:30.194
Explain to me why any of this matters.

654
00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:34.156
Fact one - we got a plane filled with killers,
rapists and thieves and Cameron Poe -

655
00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:37.701
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef,
non-gang affiliated.

656
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.662
He's a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

657
00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:42.873
Fact two - Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

658
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.543
Doesn't do it. Why?

659
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:49.129
Fact three - our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe

660
00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:52.883
planted Sims' tape recorder on him.
These are interesting facts.

661
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.679
You do the math on this,
and we got an ally on that plane.

662
00:50:56.845 --> 00:51:00.432
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

663
00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:04.520
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

664
00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:08.274
- Could have happened to any one of us.
- I am not one of these animals.

665
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.026
That's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

666
00:51:11.193 --> 00:51:14.238
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilisation.

667
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:18.284
"The degree of civilisation in a society
can be judged by observing its prisoners."

668
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.287
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

669
00:51:21.453 --> 00:51:26.083
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom said that after
putting a bullet in my agent's head, OK?

670
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.627
The issue here
is how the plane is brought down.

671
00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:30.754
Shoot it down.

672
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:34.842
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

673
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:37.428
The second a DEA agent was murdered.

674
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.972
I am authorised
to bring Sims' killers to justice

675
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:43.350
using - and I quote -
"All necessary means."

676
00:51:43.517 --> 00:51:47.479
- Not including shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

677
00:51:47.646 --> 00:51:51.984
- You're not seriously entertaining this.
- This is a drastic situation we got.

678
00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:55.571
- Those are our men up there!
- All of whom signed a no-hostage clause.

679
00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:59.116
Who are you to decide the value of
a man's life? There are innocent people!

680
00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.201
- <i>(helicopters whirring)</i>
- About time.

681
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:06.373
- About time for what?
- Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

682
00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:15.132
Goddamn it! Skip, don't do this!

683
00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:18.260
He's in an irrational state of mind!
His head isn't on straight.

684
00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:23.599
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

685
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.278
Gentlemen, in roughly five hours
we will be flying over the shores of Mexico,

686
00:52:36.445 --> 00:52:39.281
but first we have to change aircraft.

687
00:52:39.448 --> 00:52:41.700
Thank you, and have a pleasant flight.

688
00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:46.830
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes.

689
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:50.626
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

690
00:52:50.793 --> 00:52:54.963
We're draggin', baby. The landing gear
ain't all the way up. We're gonna be late.

691
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.883
- No, Cyrus, that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

692
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.886
- What the hell I know about landing gear?
- Learn.

693
00:53:04.098 --> 00:53:05.766
Hillbilly!

694
00:53:06.141 --> 00:53:07.893
Poe.

695
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:13.190
Yeah?

696
00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:16.485
Cyrus wants you
to check out the landing gear.

697
00:53:16.652 --> 00:53:19.780
Maybe I'll get to see some nice scenery
whippin' by down there.

698
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.121
Trees and stuff.

699
00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:50.352
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

700
00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:53.689
Cut him loose. He's slowin' us down.
Dead weight.

701
00:53:53.856 --> 00:53:55.816
Not exactly a proper burial.

702
00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:58.652
Look at our shit over there.

703
00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:20.466
Hurry up.

704
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:25.053
Hillbilly.

705
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:26.847
Gotcha.

706
00:54:28.056 --> 00:54:30.684
Hurry up, man.

707
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.358
Bye, Pinball.

708
00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:52.289
<i>(♪ Theme from "A Summer Place"
by Percy Faith & His Orchestra)</i>

709
00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:55.417
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

710
00:54:55.584 --> 00:55:00.589
Every time I get her waxed, I get ten feet
from the car wash and then, pow, bird shit.

711
00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:03.342
Well, it's supposed to be good luck.

712
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.806
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

713
00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:16.897
<i>(screaming)</i>

714
00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:34.122
- You were in the Q, right?
- Yeah.

715
00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:37.334
And I heard you say you had 15 years.

716
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.546
That's right.

717
00:55:40.712 --> 00:55:44.758
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

718
00:55:44.925 --> 00:55:46.260
Yeah.

719
00:55:47.928 --> 00:55:50.514
Yeah. Funny thing.

720
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:55.477
I was on north block.
I don't know you.

721
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:58.146
Well, you know what, pal?

722
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:03.485
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly-shit.

723
00:56:03.652 --> 00:56:06.196
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block

724
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:10.617
and I didn't want to know 159 of them,
which included you.

725
00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:14.663
- What do you think about that?
- Yeah.

726
00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:25.841
He's a font of misplaced rage.

727
00:56:26.008 --> 00:56:30.429
Name your cliché. Mother held him
too much, or not enough.

728
00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:34.057
Last picked at kickball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

729
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:38.937
Now he's so angry, moments of levity
actually cause him pain.

730
00:56:39.771 --> 00:56:41.607
Gives him headaches.

731
00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:44.484
Happiness, for that gentleman, hurts.

732
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:47.529
What's wrong with him?

733
00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:50.782
My first thought would be... a lot.

734
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.203
- Hello.
- Hello.

735
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.414
- Hi. I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

736
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.043
Nice to meet ya.
This must be Casey.

737
00:57:01.209 --> 00:57:03.045
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.

738
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.838
Nice to meet ya.

739
00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:07.007
So how are you doin'?

740
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:09.426
I'm sorry. Scratch that.
Dumb question.

741
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.221
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

742
00:57:13.388 --> 00:57:15.891
Maybe you could tell me
exactly what's going on here.

743
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:19.728
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

744
00:57:19.895 --> 00:57:22.814
Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you.

745
00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:29.613
Hey, wait. Where'd you get the rims, man?

746
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.491
Our personal shit's down in the belly.

747
00:57:34.493 --> 00:57:37.120
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

748
00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.247
Men!

749
00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:49.257
It seems that your husband, Cameron,

750
00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:51.635
had an opportunity to get off the plane
and didn't,

751
00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:58.016
and I was hoping you could
maybe help me figure out why.

752
00:57:58.183 --> 00:58:00.686
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

753
00:58:01.561 --> 00:58:03.772
I mean, it's possible... it's not uncommon

754
00:58:03.939 --> 00:58:06.942
that some parolees
actually fear their release date.

755
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:10.570
A certain degree
of institutionalisation sets in.

756
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.531
Fear of coming home,
living in society...

757
00:58:12.698 --> 00:58:14.324
- Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

758
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.953
That's not Cameron. I mean,
if you knew him, if you read his letters,

759
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.664
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that...

760
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:25.085
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna...

761
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:31.925
I mean, look, he's got this little girl
to come home to.

762
00:58:33.885 --> 00:58:36.304
Wouldn't you...

763
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.473
do the same thing?

764
00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:45.022
There'd have to be a pretty strong reason
to keep me on that plane.

765
00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.649
Knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

766
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.573
Maybe, if you do see him
or if you talk to him,

767
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:58.785
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

768
00:58:58.952 --> 00:59:01.413
Be kinda nice to have him around.

769
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.332
- You got it.
<i>- (knocking at door)</i>

770
00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:07.627
Vince, line one.

771
00:59:09.921 --> 00:59:11.798
This body fell out of the sky.

772
00:59:11.965 --> 00:59:16.303
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

773
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.890
<i>- We got a problem here with a corpse.</i>
- Uh-huh.

774
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:23.894
Yeah, it fell out of the sky.
I don't think he's an astronaut.

775
00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:26.188
And what's this got to do with me?

776
00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:29.858
It's got your name written all over it.

777
00:59:35.197 --> 00:59:37.866
Last transponder tag was in Arizona.

778
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:40.410
Body falls here in Fresno.

779
00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:43.121
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

780
00:59:43.288 --> 00:59:44.915
- Get me Chief...
- Devers.

781
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:47.167
Please. Thank you.

782
00:59:47.334 --> 00:59:49.294
- Vince?
- Turn around.

783
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:52.339
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield.
It's 100 miles from here.

784
00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:56.259
Horseshit! We're tailing
the transponder tag into Arizona.

785
00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:58.637
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

786
00:59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.056
<i>It had a note on it.</i>

787
01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.267
We got 'em vectored
at 12 o'clock and 30 miles.

788
01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:08.480
- Vince, please, son. We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

789
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.816
It was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

790
01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.110
- You're chasing the wrong...
- Aw, shut up.

791
01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:14.778
Hello?

792
01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.824
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

793
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.867
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

794
01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:24.162
I gotta get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

795
01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.498
Got a fast car, you can drive it.

796
01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.796
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

797
01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:37.759
Send what you got - sheriff, state trooper,
National Guard. Hold on one minute.

798
01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:43.306
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

799
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.934
It's a matter of time
before they find the weapons.

800
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.150
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

801
01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.068
How do you think I got the number?

802
01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.035
"...Appears to the United States
Parole Commission that..."

803
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:06.872
Poe.

804
01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:11.334
Man! Oh, yeah!

805
01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.630
Put the bunny back in the box.

806
01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:21.219
I knew you was a punk,
and I was right.

807
01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:27.100
You been playin' us all along.
You a free man.

808
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:33.732
I said, put the bunny back in the box.

809
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.306
Die, punk!

810
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:19.444
Why couldn't you
put the bunny back in the box?

811
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:25.283
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Redwall cliffs...

812
01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.206
We're seconds away
from establishing visual contact.

813
01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:35.919
Holy shit!

814
01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.712
Abort! Abort! Abort!

815
01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:44.177
If that aircraft's carrying 30 prisoners,
I'm Elvis Presley.

816
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:49.599
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."

817
01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.600
Shit!

818
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:56.940
300 fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

819
01:02:57.107 --> 01:03:02.237
We need to get to Lerner Airfield now!
Get me Vince Larkin.

820
01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.958
Two went down, one came up.

821
01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.295
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

822
01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.131
Most murders are crimes of necessity
rather than desire.

823
01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:26.970
But the great ones - Dahmer, Gacy,
Bundy - they did it because it excited them.

824
01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.972
Don't you...

825
01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:34.144
I got nothing in common with them,
with you. Don't you talk to me!

826
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:37.981
- They were insane.
- Now you're talking semantics.

827
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:43.194
What if I told you insane was working 50
hours a week in some office for 50 years,

828
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.447
at the end of which they tell you
to piss off?

829
01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:48.283
Ending up in some retirement village,

830
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:53.955
hoping to die before suffering the indignity
of trying to make it to the toilet on time.

831
01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.916
Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?

832
01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:02.714
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane.

833
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:08.303
One girl... I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

834
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.264
It's my daughter's birthday today,

835
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:14.684
so please feel free
not to share everything with me.

836
01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:19.290
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crank the knuckles and hit the crystals.

837
01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:22.043
We're putting this baby down
in a sandbox.

838
01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:32.846
Lerner Tower, do you copy?

839
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:37.183
<i>Lerner Tower. Are you there, Phil?</i>

840
01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.523
<i>Come on, answer me.</i>

841
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.733
<i>I am landing.</i>

842
01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:15.138
Oh, my God.

843
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.265
Look out!

844
01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.412
<i>Cuidado!</i>

845
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.094
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

846
01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.474
Thank you for choosing Con Air.

847
01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:47.981
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

848
01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:51.985
The last guy who said to have patience -
I burned him down and bagged his ashes.

849
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:54.070
Cyrus, it'll be here.

850
01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:06.791
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

851
01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:13.673
I hope he likes sand.

852
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.426
<i>Muchacho,</i> check out the tower.
Have a look-see, yeah?

853
01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.636
- All right.
- You come with us.

854
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.143
- We're gettin' off.
- I can't.

855
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.478
- Yes, you can. Come on!
- You shouldn't move him.

856
01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:30.398
- I'm getting him off of this plane.
- You can't move him.

857
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:32.900
He's too far along.
He could go into shock.

858
01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:35.236
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

859
01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:37.739
I'm not leaving without you. Or you.

860
01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:40.742
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

861
01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.120
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

862
01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.748
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck, or hit the fence.

863
01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:49.292
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

864
01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.711
Just go.

865
01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:55.256
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

866
01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.009
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

867
01:08:58.176 --> 01:08:59.218
Fuck.

868
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.430
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

869
01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:08.144
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot

870
01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:11.356
♪ Comin' for to carry me home

871
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.026
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

872
01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:17.862
- It's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

873
01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.990
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

874
01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:25.828
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

875
01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.832
I can't think of a thing I'd like better

876
01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:34.420
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

877
01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.340
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

878
01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.678
I mean, I don't know him that well myself.
Just what I read.

879
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:45.181
He firebombed that senator's yacht
with two of his own cousins on board.

880
01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.183
So what's your point?

881
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:51.312
Why not kill some hired guns once they'd
served his purpose? Think about that.

882
01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:56.442
- What exactly are we discussing here?
- Poe don't want me to off the pigs.

883
01:09:56.609 --> 01:10:00.279
It's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards,

884
01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:08.162
and my own proclivities are well-known
and often-lamented facts of penal lore.

885
01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:11.541
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

886
01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.293
Cyrus, this is your barbecue, man,
and it tastes good.

887
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.715
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over here
that if it was my barbecue,

888
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:22.593
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet in the sky
before I start killin' our only leverage.

889
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.430
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high and get laid?

890
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:26.806
Oh, fuck this!

891
01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:30.560
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

892
01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.272
Poe's right. We're goin' to Plan B.

893
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.066
Gonna get a refuelling truck
and a tractor.

894
01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.777
So get back there and dig the plane out.

895
01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:57.962
No.

896
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.425
Yes.

897
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.443
Viking, about time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?

898
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.028
Right.

899
01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.365
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

900
01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.160
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

901
01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:32.914
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.

902
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.666
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

903
01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.336
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

904
01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:45.593
- Have you found Vince Larkin?
- We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

905
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.887
Of course you're having trouble
reaching him!

906
01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:53.184
He's off saving the rain forest,
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

907
01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.720
Holy shit!

908
01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:35.935
<i>(whistles)</i>

909
01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:39.438
Hey! We got company!

910
01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.607
Hey!

911
01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.318
We got company!

912
01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:48.447
Go get Cyrus.

913
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.241
Yo, Cyrus!

914
01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:01.919
- How long we got till they get here?
- 10, 12 minutes, tops.

915
01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.723
Hi, what's your name?

916
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:14.932
Wanna play?

917
01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:16.601
<i>(laughs)</i>

918
01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.654
Nice jet.

919
01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.782
You can take Cindino
and leave the rest to rot for all I care.

920
01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:35.912
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

921
01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:38.623
<i>Comprendé, esé?</i>

922
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.920
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

923
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:45.755
Freeze!

924
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.107
<i>(exhales)</i>

925
01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.152
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

926
01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.237
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

927
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.366
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

928
01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:16.202
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

929
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:22.833
Uh-huh. In a minute.
Listen, Poe, can I lower this?

930
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.003
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

931
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.256
Sorry, boss,
but there's only two men I trust.

932
01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.968
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

933
01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:37.556
- Cindino was running a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

934
01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.518
If you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust?

935
01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:45.356
- That was a joke.
- I'm glad you told me.

936
01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:48.609
Now I gotta get back to the plane.

937
01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:51.570
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

938
01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:54.991
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

939
01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.868
You got a friend on board?

940
01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:01.789
See, I knew I was right about you.
I read your file.

941
01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.959
You're not a bad guy.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

942
01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.670
Goodbye, Larkin.

943
01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:12.508
I spoke to your wife.

944
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.017
- In person?
- In person.

945
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.228
And your little girl.

946
01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:29.025
You saw Casey?

947
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:31.610
Uh-huh.

948
01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:38.826
If this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter won't understand.

949
01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:45.416
If you talk to my wife again,
you tell her... I love her.

950
01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:50.087
She's my hummingbird.

951
01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:54.967
But I couldn't leave a fallen man behind.

952
01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.930
You'll do that for me, won't you, Larkin?

953
01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:04.060
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

954
01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:09.398
What do you think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna save the fuckin' day.

955
01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:27.291
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

956
01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.293
I want this airplane out now.

957
01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.546
Come on, men!

958
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:51.107
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

959
01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:56.779
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

960
01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.785
Are you sick?

961
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:08.207
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

962
01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:12.837
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

963
01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:15.756
There is no medicine for what I have.

964
01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:20.010
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.805
