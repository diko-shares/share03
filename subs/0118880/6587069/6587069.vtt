00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:29.538
Army Rangers have a proud history.

2
00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:33.876
Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation

3
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:36.920
in which the United States
has been involved.

4
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:41.342
You, men, are a credit to that fine heritage,
and I'm sorry to see you go.

5
00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:45.429
But you've served your country well,
and you've displayed the ability to fight on

6
00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.765
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission:

7
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:52.895
never leaving behind a fallen comrade
no matter what the odds or the enemy.

8
00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:54.605
I thank you.

9
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.982
America thanks you.

10
00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.789
And I wish you luck
wherever you go.

11
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.697
And remember.
Rangers lead the way.

12
00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:13.957

00:01:16.794 --> 00:01:18.629

-You know this gentleman, honey?
- He's a regular.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.913
Yeah, I'm a regular.
Huh. Regular hound dog.

38
00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.714
This is a special occasion,
and if you don't mind,

39
00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:41.829
I'd like to spend it
dancin' with my wife.

40
00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:46.425
Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't
you go buy me and my buddies a round?

41
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:49.511
Hey, Cameron, no.
It ain't worth it.

42
00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:53.932
Hey. Come on, daddy,
let's dance.

00:02:56.268 --> 00:03:00.267

we lost Vietnam. I'll tell ya that.

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:03.442
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.

46
00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:07.046
You know, for a second there
you were that guy again.

47
00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:10.240
I know it.

48
00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:16.015

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.740
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.

57
00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:58.330
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.

58
00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:01.166
- Come on.
- Cameron!

59
00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:03.627
Cameron, get in the car!

60
00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:12.136
Dale! Dale!

61
00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:27.109
Take this,
you son of a bitch!

62
00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.675
Tricia!

63
00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:46.179
Tricia!

64
00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:54.553
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.

65
00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:00.059
Admit the facts,
enter a plea bargain.

66
00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:02.102
I will not plead guilty.

67
00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:04.396
You could get ten years.

68
00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:11.403
Admit to it, you get four.

69
00:05:11.487 --> 00:05:14.031
Serve maybe a year.

70
00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:19.536
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

71
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.539
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon

72
00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:25.834
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked

73
00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.420
because you can respond
with deadly force.

74
00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:32.633
It is the order of this court that
you be remanded to a federal penitentiary

75
00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:37.972
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than... 7 to 10 years.

76
00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:48.878
Hello, pretty girl.

77
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:52.116
Come, come.
Bring it here. Hey! Hey!

78
00:05:54.613 --> 00:05:59.493
<i>Dearest Tricia, I think of you always.
Your smile, your laugh.</i>

79
00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:03.455
<i>I'm not angry.
The blame's gotta fall on me.</i>

80
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.909
<i>I am, however, torn apart
when I think that I won't be there</i>

81
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.837
<i>to see our child
come into the world</i>

82
00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:12.923
<i>cradled in your arms,
and her first smile.</i>

83
00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:17.011
<i>I got your package.
Those pink coconut things</i>

84
00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:19.471
<i>have made me quite popular.</i>

85
00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:24.435
<i>Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.</i>

86
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:29.982
<i>And now our daughter,
beautiful Casey.</i>

87
00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:32.484
<i>I watch her grow
in the pictures you send.</i>

88
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:35.321
<i>I showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.</i>

89
00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:37.990
<i>He said "Thank God
she looks like her mama".</i>

90
00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:39.725
<i>I'd have to agree.</i>

91
00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:44.091
<i>It's funny, but here I am in maybe
the worst place on earth, and yet,</i>

92
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.832
<i>somehow, I feel like
the luckiest man alive.</i>

93
00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:58.469
<i>Dear daddy, I started today at
the Little Sunshine Day Care Center.</i>

94
00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:01.472
<i>My teacher is Miss Gordon.
She is nice.</i>

95
00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.975
<i>We go to playtime, and we all have
to hold hands when we walk there.</i>

96
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.228
<i>Dear Casey, it was so good
to read your letter.</i>

97
00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:10.314
<i>I'm glad you like your teacher.</i>

98
00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.858
<i>We don't exactly have
a playtime like you.</i>

99
00:07:12.983 --> 00:07:17.321
<i>We do go outside, though. But
normally, we don't hold hands.</i>

100
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:25.037
<i>My wife and I will have
our Margaritas on the yacht.</i>

101
00:07:32.002 --> 00:07:35.214
<i>Dear daddy, today was
my first day at first grade.</i>

102
00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:39.343
<i>I didn't like it. I don't want
to go back tomorrow.</i>

103
00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:43.931
<i>This boy, Scotty Dalton, has
black teeth and calls me names.</i>

104
00:07:44.056 --> 00:07:47.893
<i>Mama says I have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.</i>

105
00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:52.731
<i>Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.</i>

106
00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:57.069
<i>School is very important.
Your mama's right.</i>

107
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:00.280
<i>Now, don't you worry
about little Scotty Dalton.</i>

108
00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:04.201
<i>Sometimes you meet people like that,
but don't let 'em get you down.</i>

109
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:12.814
<i>Dear daddy,
are you ever comin' home?</i>

110
00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:16.046
<i>Dear Casey,
of course I'm comin' home.</i>

111
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.425
<i>In just a little while longer, and all
the things we missed doin' together,</i>

112
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.552
<i>you can be sure we'll do.</i>

113
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:26.098
<i>Dear Hummingbird, break out
the fine china, chill the lemonade,</i>

114
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.434
<i>tie a yellow ribbon
'round the old oak tree</i>

115
00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:32.438
<i>'cause this boy's comin' home to
his ladies, comin' home forever.</i>

116
00:08:32.563 --> 00:08:37.067
<i>I just hope I'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.</i>

117
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.666
<i>Love, Cameron.</i>

118
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.324
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th."

119
00:08:43.407 --> 00:08:46.066
"My birthday is July 14th."

120
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.831
"I'm gonna see my daddy for
the first time ever on July 14th."

121
00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:54.626
I can't wait to meet you, honey. Isn't
that the cutest thing you ever heard?

122
00:08:54.752 --> 00:08:56.795
Yeah, man.

123
00:08:58.464 --> 00:09:00.055
Hey, now, what is this?

124
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.061
I can't see my little daughter
on her birthday

125
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:05.103
without bringin'
her a gift, now can I?

126
00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:07.658
Yeah, man,
but that's a bunny rabbit.

127
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:10.059
That's all right. I mean,
she'll like it, right? I mean, what?

128
00:09:10.142 --> 00:09:12.416
It's either this
or a tube of toothpaste

129
00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:14.298
and two packs
of Pall Malls at the canteen.

130
00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:18.157
- Now, that's a present.
- I'll remember that on your birthday.

131
00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.429
Yeah, you do that, man.

132
00:09:25.991 --> 00:09:29.787
"It having been made to appear to
the United States Parole Commission,"

133
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.749
"Cameron Poe is eligible
to be paroled."

134
00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:37.270
Shit, might be a long time before I see
somethin' like that with my name on it.

135
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.868
You'll get your own date
someday, Baby-O.

136
00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:49.143
I ain't worried about that, man.

137
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:52.810
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?

138
00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:56.105
God's got my back.
You know what I'm sayin'?

139
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.288
I'm goin' home, son!

140
00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:03.195
Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy
on me, all right? Get off me.

141
00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:06.806
Step out.

142
00:10:10.327 --> 00:10:13.372
Good-bye. Good night.

143
00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:24.174
The U.S. Marshal Service
annually flies

144
00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:27.511
155,000 prisoners
around the country

145
00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:30.639
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.

146
00:10:30.723 --> 00:10:34.727
As you know, today's flight
is a special one.

147
00:10:34.852 --> 00:10:38.188
We're populating Alabama's
Feltham Penitentiary,

148
00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:41.317
the newest super-max facility
in the system.

149
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.653
This place was designed
to warehouse the worst of the worst.

150
00:10:44.737 --> 00:10:48.574
Now, most of these guys
are lifers, some on death row.

151
00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:52.661
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

152
00:10:55.205 --> 00:10:58.375
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

153
00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.919
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

154
00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:04.548
I gotta be gettin' my shot before
we go gettin' on some airplane, guard Bishop.

155
00:11:04.632 --> 00:11:05.521
What's your name?

156
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.826
Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

157
00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:12.147
Okay, you're diabetic? All
right, your insulin's on board.

158
00:11:12.147 --> 00:11:13.726
We'll give it to you in flight.

159
00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.935
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

160
00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:18.854
You know you're still under full
restraints till you're processed

161
00:11:18.937 --> 00:11:21.065
and released from
your original prison, understand?

162
00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:24.401
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

163
00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:27.279
- It's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

164
00:11:27.363 --> 00:11:31.367
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.

165
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.827
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy

166
00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:37.623
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by... homemade cookies and...

167
00:11:37.748 --> 00:11:39.557
and love-starved murderers.

168
00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:41.401
No way.

169
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:44.766
What you got here is a walking
talking reason to rehabilitate.

170
00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:53.263
So, today let's exemplify
our three operative words:

171
00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:56.558
firm, fair and vigilant.

172
00:11:57.685 --> 00:11:59.439
Now, let's go to work.

173
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.981
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest are sheeted to Feltham.

174
00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:04.274
Good. Let's go deal
with the DEA boys.

175
00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:10.114
- You know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

176
00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:13.082
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

177
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.912
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

178
00:12:16.996 --> 00:12:20.624
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

179
00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:22.751
This, this is
fucking spectacular!

180
00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:25.963
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

181
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:29.976
- Vince, Duncan Malloy, DEA.
- Nice to meet ya.

182
00:12:29.976 --> 00:12:33.895
I'm sure we're gonna have a good time
working on this together.

183
00:12:49.153 --> 00:12:50.472
- Hey, Willie.
- Boys!

184
00:12:50.472 --> 00:12:51.437
- How you doin'?
- What's up, chief?

185
00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.290
You know each other?

186
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.621
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.

187
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:56.577
This is our file on your man,
Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo,

188
00:12:56.618 --> 00:12:58.245
prime mover of narcotics
from Colombia.

189
00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:00.675
It's gonna be
an all-star flight.

190
00:13:01.498 --> 00:13:04.084
This kid's a potential fountain of
information about the family business.

191
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:06.211
- Eleven and a half okay?
- Yeah.

192
00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:08.547
Look at him.
Nice college boy, right?

193
00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:10.591
We interrogated him for months.
He gave up nothing.

194
00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:12.843
This is our last chance
before the FBI gets him.

195
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:14.970
Over my dead body,
those assholes get the glory.

196
00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:17.389
We pick up Mr. Cindino
in Carson City.

197
00:13:17.473 --> 00:13:20.351
From then until the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

198
00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.353
We got you a seat right next
to him, and he's known to be

199
00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:24.271
somewhat garrulous
in the company of thieves.

200
00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:26.398
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

201
00:13:26.482 --> 00:13:30.402
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

202
00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:32.404
What's with dictionary boy here?

203
00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:35.491
Thesaurus boy, I think,
is more appropriate.

204
00:13:35.574 --> 00:13:37.660
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:37.743 --> 00:13:40.496
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

206
00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:43.957
- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

207
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:46.293
I got a small arsenal
in the belly of the plane.

208
00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:49.254
A pistol in the cockpit
lockbox. That's it.

209
00:13:49.338 --> 00:13:51.256
Other than that, we keep
the plane like a prison.

210
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.342
No weapon
on the aircraft, period.

211
00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:56.011
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

212
00:13:56.095 --> 00:13:58.514
Then your man
doesn't get on the plane.

213
00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:04.144
Okay, Willie, give it to him.

214
00:14:05.437 --> 00:14:07.439
Give him the gun.

215
00:14:14.113 --> 00:14:16.156
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

216
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.160
- In the pen, it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin! I got it.

217
00:14:20.244 --> 00:14:22.050
Okay.

218
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.959
<i>Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.</i>

219
00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:29.646
<i>Waiting your go
on separate transfer.</i>

220
00:14:30.587 --> 00:14:33.299
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

221
00:14:33.382 --> 00:14:36.802
- That's William Bedford, aka "Billy Bedlam".
- The mass murderer?

222
00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:40.139
The same. He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

223
00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:43.225
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

224
00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:45.561
Killed her parents, her brothers, her
sisters, even her dog.

225
00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:47.318
Scan him.

226
00:14:47.438 --> 00:14:49.898
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

227
00:14:49.982 --> 00:14:52.901
Nathan Jones,
aka "Diamond Dog".

228
00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:55.362
Former general of
the Black Guerrillas.

229
00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:57.823
He blew up a meeting of the National
Rifle Association saying,

230
00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:01.535
and I quote "They represented the
basest negativity of the white race".

231
00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.664
He wrote a book in prison called
"Reflections In A Diamond Eye".

232
00:15:05.748 --> 00:15:08.250
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community".

233
00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:11.003
They're... talking to Denzel
for the movie.

234
00:15:21.513 --> 00:15:23.515
Close door number one.

235
00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:28.187
This one's done it all.
Kidnapping,

236
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.689
robbery, murder, extortion...

237
00:15:30.773 --> 00:15:34.068
<i>Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.
You are cleared to release.</i>

238
00:15:36.195 --> 00:15:40.574
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus".

239
00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:44.078
Thirty-nine years old,
25 of them spent in our institutions.

240
00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:47.915
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

241
00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:52.795
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

242
00:15:52.878 --> 00:15:55.339
Likes to brag that he killed
more men than cancer.

243
00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:57.071
Okay, open wide.

244
00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:58.973
Lift your tongue.

245
00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:04.659
Cyrus is a poster child
for the criminally insane.

246
00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.584
He's a true product of the system.

247
00:16:06.584 --> 00:16:10.229
What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what
is he, one of these sociology majors

248
00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:12.773
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

249
00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:16.078
No, but I could point a few fingers
if it would make you feel comfortable.

250
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.581
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

251
00:16:29.665 --> 00:16:32.001
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

252
00:16:32.084 --> 00:16:34.503
Oh, man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

253
00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:36.343
He told me he loved me.

254
00:16:36.588 --> 00:16:39.425
- Get outta my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

255
00:16:44.096 --> 00:16:46.807
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

256
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.352
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

257
00:16:51.228 --> 00:16:52.193
Okay, let's do it.

258
00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:57.693
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

259
00:17:00.154 --> 00:17:01.697
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

260
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.824
Tell me, Skip, is
the U.S. Marshal Service

261
00:17:03.907 --> 00:17:06.869
in the habit of employing
annoying, wise-ass bookworm creeps?

262
00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:08.579
Larkin's one of the best
we got.

263
00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:12.124
Yeah, well, I'd still like
to crush his larynx with my boot.

264
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:16.650
Scan him.

265
00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:18.808
Face me.

266
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:25.888
- What's this shit?
- It's my daughter.

267
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:27.681
I don't care if it's
the weepin' mama of Christ.

268
00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:29.767
There's no personal possessions
on this airplane.

269
00:17:29.892 --> 00:17:32.311
Just as long as you know
I'll be gettin' that back at some point.

270
00:17:32.394 --> 00:17:35.230
Are you tellin' me what I'm gonna
be doin' here, numb-nuts?

271
00:17:35.314 --> 00:17:37.232
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

272
00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:38.339
Come on, break it up.

273
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:46.533
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

274
00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:51.747
- Right here.
<i>- Attention, officers.</i>

275
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.709
<i>- Final check, all restraints.</i>
- Sweet bird of freedom.

276
00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:57.920
<i>Take off in three minutes.</i>

277
00:17:58.003 --> 00:18:01.597
What's up, man?
Oh, shit. What's up?

278
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:04.718
I thought you was someone else.
Pinball Parker.

279
00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:09.306
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. I'm
a hell of a nice guy. I just got caught.

280
00:18:09.431 --> 00:18:11.909
Aw, shucks.

281
00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:18.865
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

282
00:18:19.942 --> 00:18:21.742
Come on.

283
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:25.662
Open.

284
00:18:33.622 --> 00:18:35.624
You guys are late
for the party.

285
00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:38.460
- Okay.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

286
00:18:44.174 --> 00:18:46.176
What's up, Cochise?

287
00:18:46.302 --> 00:18:47.459
How?

288
00:18:48.637 --> 00:18:50.931
Hey, man, I'm just fuckin' with you,
all right? Don't get all...

289
00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:53.523
"Wounded Knee" on me
and shit.

290
00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.896
You look like
you wanna scalp a nigger.

291
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:01.836
What you lookin' at, punk?

292
00:19:03.068 --> 00:19:06.697
Nothin'. I was just...
admirin' your cage.

293
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.699
Fits you pretty good.

294
00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:13.295
Well, welcome aboard.

295
00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:16.206
My, my. As I look around I see
a lot of celebrities among us.

296
00:19:16.332 --> 00:19:19.131
I see 11 Current Affairs,
two Hard Copies,

297
00:19:19.131 --> 00:19:21.383
and a genuine
Geraldo interviewee.

298
00:19:21.844 --> 00:19:23.756
But I gotta tell you,
gentlemen, none of this impresses me.

299
00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:27.009
Because we have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

300
00:19:27.092 --> 00:19:29.637
It's a lot like kindergarten.
You'll keep your hands to yourself,

301
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.139
you keep the decibel level down...

302
00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:34.735
And if any of you should feel
the need to scream, spit or bite,

303
00:19:34.735 --> 00:19:36.278
you get the treatment.

304
00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:39.396
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

305
00:19:42.483 --> 00:19:44.526
See, this kinda thing
puts me in a foul mood.

306
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.821
These rules will be enforced.
If there's a hint of trouble,

307
00:19:47.905 --> 00:19:50.234
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction,

308
00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:52.219
it offends
my delicate nasal passages,

309
00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:55.876
your testicles will become
my personal property.

310
00:19:56.872 --> 00:20:00.555
That's pretty clear. Good.

311
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.606
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

312
00:20:22.773 --> 00:20:25.742
Ah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

313
00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:29.071
Anyway, I despise rapists.

314
00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:32.032
For me, you're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff

315
00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:35.494
that accumulates at the corner in
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

316
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:38.928
But, in your case,
I'll make an exception.

317
00:20:39.748 --> 00:20:42.751
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

318
00:20:42.835 --> 00:20:47.256
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

319
00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:49.008
Well, I think you'll like it,
Cyrus. It's called

320
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:51.385
"I'll Never Make Love
To A Woman On The Beach Again".

321
00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:56.065
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short "No More Steak For Me Ever".

322
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.205
Funny fucker, aren't ya?

323
00:21:04.273 --> 00:21:07.776
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

324
00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.112
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

325
00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:13.574
The only thing we gotta worry about is
stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

326
00:21:16.327 --> 00:21:18.709
Close forward gate.

327
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.495
Close middle gate.

328
00:22:18.483 --> 00:22:19.640
Come on, I need my shot!

329
00:22:19.723 --> 00:22:22.935
Comin'. I'm comin'.
Left arm.

330
00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:41.036
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right...

331
00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.253
hope you don't hold
a grudge.

332
00:22:43.872 --> 00:22:46.264
What the fuck
are you doin'?

333
00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:54.550
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

334
00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:56.802
The Last Mohican
is burnin', man!

335
00:22:58.762 --> 00:23:02.391
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker,
man? He spontaneously combusted.

336
00:23:04.435 --> 00:23:08.063
He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

337
00:23:08.105 --> 00:23:09.323
Code red! Code red!

338
00:23:09.323 --> 00:23:11.246
- Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.

339
00:23:11.246 --> 00:23:12.555
- I've got a fire.
- Where is it?

340
00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:14.417
She's reporting it
in the rear cabin.

341
00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:19.329
At first I thought he was singin'
Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.

342
00:23:19.408 --> 00:23:20.894
Sh-shit!

343
00:23:33.422 --> 00:23:35.883
Holy shit!
Hold on, Bobby!

344
00:23:37.343 --> 00:23:38.810
Gimme a taser!

345
00:23:41.722 --> 00:23:43.980
Hey, man,
get off my insulin!

346
00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:49.021
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

347
00:23:54.068 --> 00:23:56.862
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

348
00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:02.618
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

349
00:24:05.788 --> 00:24:07.748
Pinball, behind you!

350
00:24:10.334 --> 00:24:13.128
Get the gun out of the lockbox, Mack.
Go on back there, check it out.

351
00:24:25.808 --> 00:24:27.476
Go! Go!

352
00:24:42.574 --> 00:24:43.502
Oh, my God.

353
00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:46.468
Say there was a disturbance
but everything's under control.

354
00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:48.163
Say it, or I will kill you.

355
00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:50.457
Without me, you got nobody
to fly the plane.

356
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:53.127
I never think that far ahead.

357
00:24:54.878 --> 00:24:57.381
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just... take it easy.

358
00:24:57.506 --> 00:25:00.718
And if you say a word about this over
the radio, the next wings you see

359
00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:05.055
will belong to the flies buzzing
over your rotting corpse.

360
00:25:07.257 --> 00:25:08.675
Uh, Carson City.

361
00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:10.978
Hey! Hey!

362
00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:21.405
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

363
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.824
I have the only gun
on board.

364
00:25:23.907 --> 00:25:26.160
Welcome to Con Air.

365
00:25:35.452 --> 00:25:37.921
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

366
00:25:38.047 --> 00:25:40.924
Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

367
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.718
Just a little ruckus?

368
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.386
Pilot just checked in.
Everything's fine.

369
00:25:44.428 --> 00:25:48.857
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

370
00:25:49.058 --> 00:25:51.518
Damn, this pig is heavy!

371
00:25:51.602 --> 00:25:53.191
Oops.

372
00:25:58.108 --> 00:25:59.721
Shit.

373
00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:01.945
If we let you out,
you gonna play nice, Billy?

374
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:04.398
Probably not.

375
00:26:11.455 --> 00:26:13.791
I got a spot on my arm
just for you.

376
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:15.584
Hey, man, yo. Come on,
get off my medication.

377
00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:18.087
I'm sorry, man.
The shit's in my way.

378
00:26:18.128 --> 00:26:20.530
I'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.

379
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.573
All right here, man. Come on.

380
00:26:21.573 --> 00:26:23.346
All right, man. Stop rushin'.

381
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.934
Ah, yeah.

382
00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:39.108
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

383
00:26:41.485 --> 00:26:43.904
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

384
00:26:46.323 --> 00:26:48.742
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

385
00:26:51.245 --> 00:26:54.164
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

386
00:26:54.248 --> 00:26:56.125
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

387
00:26:56.166 --> 00:26:58.627
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

388
00:26:58.669 --> 00:27:01.088
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

389
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:02.965
You keep that in mind
when you look at her

390
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.467
because if your dick
jumps out of your pants

391
00:27:05.592 --> 00:27:07.636
you jump out
of this plane.

392
00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:18.480
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

393
00:27:20.274 --> 00:27:23.819
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

394
00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:26.780
Well, I know three of these brothers.
Th-they right back there.

395
00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:29.825
Uh, the other three are
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

396
00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:30.854
Where are they?

397
00:27:30.854 --> 00:27:33.916
That's a damn good question,
Cyrus. I'm gonna find out.

398
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.540
The pilot wants to know
what's next.

399
00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:39.376
He's to land at Carson City
Airport as scheduled.

400
00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:43.172
Carson City? The law is down
there. You lost your mind?

401
00:27:43.213 --> 00:27:47.384
According to my last
psych evaluation... yes.

402
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:49.386
Diamond Dog, if you would.

403
00:27:51.722 --> 00:27:56.560
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

404
00:27:56.685 --> 00:28:00.119
Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards
armed with shotguns

405
00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:02.180
are waitin'
for us at the next stop.

406
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.069
Now, if you do exactly
what we tell ya...

407
00:28:05.194 --> 00:28:09.031
the rest of our lives will be a vacation
in a non-extradition country.

408
00:28:09.673 --> 00:28:14.203
I'm talkin' sandy beaches,
umbrella drinks...

409
00:28:14.328 --> 00:28:16.635
and dirty, naked freaks.

410
00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:19.583
It'll be a paid
motherfuckin' vacation.

411
00:28:21.085 --> 00:28:22.630
Wait. Who's doin' the payin'?

412
00:28:23.045 --> 00:28:25.673
Our employer,
Francisco Cindino.

413
00:28:28.926 --> 00:28:32.813
Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,
no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

414
00:28:32.897 --> 00:28:34.682
Get that ass out here
right now!

415
00:28:34.765 --> 00:28:36.809
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

416
00:28:36.892 --> 00:28:39.353
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

417
00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:42.147
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am.

418
00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:47.319
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

419
00:28:48.078 --> 00:28:49.891
So you think I give a shit about
that little bitch guard

420
00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:50.596
you have there right now?

421
00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:52.769
Well, maybe you didn't hear
what I said. I'm DEA.

422
00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:54.464
You know what
the fuck that means?

423
00:28:54.464 --> 00:28:56.004
Y-you the most crooked nigger
on this plane.

424
00:28:56.004 --> 00:28:57.165
- Shut up.
- You're DEA?

425
00:28:57.165 --> 00:29:00.379
What are you doin' on this flight?
Won't they fly you boys commercially?

426
00:29:00.379 --> 00:29:01.512
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.

427
00:29:02.106 --> 00:29:04.197
I swear to God, I'll blow away
your little boyfriend right now.

428
00:29:04.232 --> 00:29:06.880
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield,

429
00:29:06.964 --> 00:29:09.800
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

430
00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:11.552
- Hey!
- Shut up.

431
00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:14.513
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

432
00:29:14.596 --> 00:29:17.933
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

433
00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:19.733
- Stay back!
- Just stop, right?

434
00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:20.751
Before somebody gets killed.

435
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:23.564
- Back!
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.

436
00:29:23.647 --> 00:29:24.460
Stay back!

437
00:29:24.828 --> 00:29:27.341
You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

438
00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:30.237
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

439
00:29:30.321 --> 00:29:32.906
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

440
00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:55.971
What's your name,
convict?

441
00:29:57.306 --> 00:29:59.933
- My name?
- Yeah.

442
00:30:00.417 --> 00:30:04.880
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

443
00:30:11.362 --> 00:30:13.405
Nice goin', son.

444
00:30:13.489 --> 00:30:16.116
Not only did you not save
this dude's life,

445
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.953
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

446
00:30:20.237 --> 00:30:23.999
Hey, Cyrus, I, uh, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

447
00:30:24.124 --> 00:30:25.600
Yeah, what's the good news?

448
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.548
Well, the goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

449
00:30:28.548 --> 00:30:30.756
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is

450
00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:33.968
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

451
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:37.304
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is, is Carls

452
00:30:37.388 --> 00:30:42.017
and... and this honky
he's draggin' in is Popovitch.

453
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:45.688
I don't know how to tell you this,
Cyrus, but we are three white guys short.

454
00:30:46.013 --> 00:30:49.266
Or as they say in Ebonics,
"We be fucked".

455
00:30:50.234 --> 00:30:52.870
Look man,
I just wanna know.

456
00:30:52.995 --> 00:30:57.366
All right, you didn't... You didn't mean
that dirty-nigger crackhead shit, did you?

457
00:30:57.408 --> 00:30:58.968
Gimme that gun.

458
00:30:59.243 --> 00:31:01.328
Hell, yes, I meant it.

459
00:31:01.412 --> 00:31:05.165
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane

460
00:31:05.249 --> 00:31:07.167
and we're gonna give 'em
exactly what they expect.

461
00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:10.504
- So I need three volunteers.
- Come on, let's go, son.

462
00:31:13.424 --> 00:31:15.718
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

463
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:17.892
I'm servin' eight consecutive
life sentences.

464
00:31:17.892 --> 00:31:19.434
I am not
getting off this plane.

465
00:31:19.434 --> 00:31:21.849
I got my insulin, all right, but
they broke all the damn needles.

466
00:31:21.932 --> 00:31:24.143
If I don't get my shot
in the next couple of hours,

467
00:31:24.226 --> 00:31:26.186
- somebody gonna be sending flowers to my mother.
- Me, I'll go.

468
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.814
- I'm too old for his shit.
- I mean, no offense.

469
00:31:28.897 --> 00:31:31.859
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

470
00:31:31.942 --> 00:31:34.528
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

471
00:31:35.011 --> 00:31:38.557
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

472
00:31:42.644 --> 00:31:45.706
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

473
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:47.833
That puts you
shit out of luck.

474
00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:50.294
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'll tell you what. Sit down.

475
00:31:50.419 --> 00:31:52.238
One of my associates
will bring you a phone book,

476
00:31:52.238 --> 00:31:54.305
and you call
the Affirmative Action office.

477
00:31:54.506 --> 00:31:57.896
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

478
00:31:58.093 --> 00:32:02.097
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

479
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:04.642
I'll get off,
scream to high heaven.

480
00:32:04.767 --> 00:32:07.269
This plane won't leave
Carson City.

481
00:32:10.522 --> 00:32:14.151
We need another white boy
to volunteer.

482
00:32:14.276 --> 00:32:18.364
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

483
00:32:18.489 --> 00:32:24.036
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

484
00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:25.262
You rang?

485
00:32:25.262 --> 00:32:28.177
Carson City says we got a hell
of a sandstorm down there.

486
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.460
Perfect.

487
00:32:33.045 --> 00:32:34.505
Crazy.

488
00:32:40.511 --> 00:32:43.681
<i>Vacant cell D8,
ready for inspection.</i>

489
00:32:46.558 --> 00:32:48.644
Last tenant,
Cyrus Grissom.

490
00:32:48.727 --> 00:32:51.814
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

491
00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:55.025
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

492
00:32:55.109 --> 00:32:57.069
Looks like cocaine.

493
00:33:01.532 --> 00:33:05.411
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. it's all soft.

494
00:33:10.324 --> 00:33:12.209
What about the rest
of the pigs?

495
00:33:12.293 --> 00:33:16.511
Be patient, now. They haven't
ceased to be useful yet.

496
00:33:16.797 --> 00:33:19.383
Okay, old man.
Now you're Mr. Popovitch.

497
00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:23.137
Gentlemen, you'll reach the
Nevada pen in about two hours.

498
00:33:23.262 --> 00:33:25.472
The tape's just a little
precaution in case any of you

499
00:33:25.597 --> 00:33:29.977
are rocked by the sudden impulse
to squeal like a pig.

500
00:33:30.102 --> 00:33:33.939
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

501
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.069
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.

502
00:33:39.353 --> 00:33:40.979
What?

503
00:33:41.822 --> 00:33:43.657
I changed my mind.

504
00:33:43.782 --> 00:33:46.952
So, Cyrus, we got
a little mind-changer.

505
00:33:46.994 --> 00:33:50.331
I got 15 years left, and...
I know I'd just hate myself

506
00:33:50.456 --> 00:33:53.417
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a... naked party freak

507
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.919
and... an umbrella drink.

508
00:33:56.003 --> 00:33:59.298
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

509
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.493
I know.
Fear of freedom, I guess.

510
00:34:06.513 --> 00:34:09.933
Get him up.
Get the cuffs off him.

511
00:34:09.975 --> 00:34:13.270
Pick out a guard, and then put that
dead cop's prison issues on him.

512
00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:17.941
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.

513
00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:20.861
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

514
00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:24.448
It'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

515
00:34:24.731 --> 00:34:28.970
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

516
00:34:30.037 --> 00:34:31.389
Now, what would my daughter
think of me

517
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:34.264
if I left you like
this to get dishonored and die?

518
00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:37.461
You keep actin' like you're still
a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.

519
00:34:37.544 --> 00:34:40.673
You're not that guy anymore.
You're a convict.

520
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:47.418
Dear God!

521
00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:52.393
- Told you I'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.

522
00:34:52.518 --> 00:34:56.981
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer.
Now put those on. I just saved your life.

523
00:34:59.692 --> 00:35:02.027
Okay, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

524
00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:05.612
Maybe.

525
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:24.049
<i>Chief? I got a lot
of weird shit down here.</i>

526
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:24.906
What is it?

527
00:35:24.906 --> 00:35:27.107
<i>This looks like the drawing
of a plane.</i>

528
00:35:27.142 --> 00:35:30.681
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.

529
00:35:57.796 --> 00:35:58.751
Open up!

530
00:36:14.808 --> 00:36:17.561
My daughter's picture.
Where'd you put my daughter's picture

531
00:36:17.645 --> 00:36:20.564
you shit-eatin'
peckerhead?

532
00:36:30.482 --> 00:36:32.576
Heard you had a problem
up there.

533
00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:37.289
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.

534
00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:46.090
On the bus, dickhead!
On the bus!

535
00:36:58.894 --> 00:37:00.604
Let's go.
We're at the gate.

536
00:37:06.735 --> 00:37:10.447
They took the plane. You hear that, boys?
We got the plane, man.

537
00:37:10.489 --> 00:37:13.826
Shut the fuck up, curly, all right?
You gonna get us caught!

538
00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:16.412
No way, Jose!

539
00:37:16.895 --> 00:37:19.123
You gotta be kiddin' me.

540
00:37:19.164 --> 00:37:20.769
Oh, boy.

541
00:37:24.461 --> 00:37:28.632
In Spanish from Bogota, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.

542
00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:46.850
Orange... and black.

543
00:37:48.727 --> 00:37:50.775
What's up, man?

544
00:37:50.863 --> 00:37:53.256
- So, you the Swamp Thing?
- That's right.

545
00:37:53.656 --> 00:37:56.661
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.

546
00:37:57.182 --> 00:37:59.551
It's amazing the shit
you white trash know.

547
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:01.279
That's right.

548
00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:06.503
Shit! Aw, man!

549
00:38:35.107 --> 00:38:37.067
What're you doin' here?

550
00:38:38.827 --> 00:38:42.164
Hello.
How you doin', baby?

551
00:38:42.247 --> 00:38:45.376
I'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of
the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.

552
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:48.587
- Well, this is a restricted area.
- Look, don't worry, baby.

553
00:38:48.712 --> 00:38:52.383
- It's all right. I'm a... I'm a cop.
- You work for a prison or somethin'?

554
00:38:52.508 --> 00:38:56.720
Yeah, the Department of Erect...
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.

555
00:38:57.963 --> 00:38:59.723
Creepy.

556
00:38:59.965 --> 00:39:02.801
The eyes are cut
out of their heads.

557
00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:09.308
The Last Supper.

558
00:39:11.443 --> 00:39:16.203
- Is that it?
- One more. Late addition.

559
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:18.650
- Who?
- Garland Greene.

560
00:39:19.451 --> 00:39:21.245
Should be interesting.

561
00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:46.678
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.

562
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.522
Christ in a cartoon!

563
00:39:56.647 --> 00:39:58.607
Shit, that's
Garland Greene, man.

564
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.526
The Marietta Mangler.

565
00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:02.820
That skinny little man
butchered 30 somethin' people

566
00:40:02.945 --> 00:40:05.197
up and down
the eastern seaboard.

567
00:40:05.322 --> 00:40:07.199
They say the way
he killed those people

568
00:40:07.324 --> 00:40:10.369
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge family.

569
00:40:11.503 --> 00:40:15.090
Well... he's on the right flight.

570
00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:16.701
But you know what?
You really do need to leave.

571
00:40:16.743 --> 00:40:21.181
Tina, you've got the prettiest eyes
I've seen in about five to ten.

572
00:40:29.855 --> 00:40:32.208
"Met ca... Me...
Me. Et cetera."

573
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.211
"Cetera. Meet."

574
00:40:35.694 --> 00:40:39.657
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.

575
00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:42.785
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?

576
00:40:45.604 --> 00:40:48.523
"Carson..."

577
00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:51.794
"City."

578
00:40:51.877 --> 00:40:56.715
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.

579
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:05.072
Hey, what're you doin'?
Just leave it alone.

580
00:41:05.072 --> 00:41:06.809
He told you
not to touch anything.

581
00:41:28.614 --> 00:41:30.618
What the hell?

582
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.707
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.

583
00:41:59.311 --> 00:42:00.979
Come on.

584
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:12.203
We got a situation here, sir.

585
00:42:12.874 --> 00:42:15.459
Somebody better call
the marshal's office.

586
00:42:18.121 --> 00:42:20.582
<i>Code red! Code red!
Starkey, those guards ain't guards.</i>

587
00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:23.502
<i>- They're cons. Stall 'em.
- Christ!</i>

588
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:38.976
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?

589
00:42:39.017 --> 00:42:42.604
Won't be long now.

590
00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:56.201
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!

591
00:43:03.542 --> 00:43:06.378
Do you hear somethin'
that sounds like a damn plane?

592
00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:14.344
<i>Jailbird One, you are
not cleared for takeoff.</i>

593
00:43:14.386 --> 00:43:17.848
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!

594
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:21.476
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!"
Thank you. I'm here all week.

595
00:43:25.397 --> 00:43:28.317
Hey! Hey, Cochise,
it's me!

596
00:43:28.758 --> 00:43:32.429
Pinball. I'm sorry.
Hey!

597
00:43:40.913 --> 00:43:43.040
Shine, sweet freedom,
shine!

598
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.927
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

599
00:43:55.052 --> 00:43:58.889
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

600
00:44:02.434 --> 00:44:04.728
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

601
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:08.565
Oh, yeah, it's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

602
00:44:08.607 --> 00:44:12.027
Swamp, where is
the transponder?

603
00:44:16.014 --> 00:44:18.266
Where indeed?

604
00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:23.789
Are... are you sure it's safe
to fly in this?

605
00:44:23.914 --> 00:44:26.180
No problem. I've done this
a thousand times.

606
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.192
We'll be through this
in a few minutes.

607
00:44:28.227 --> 00:44:30.045
You all right back there,
ladies?

608
00:44:32.314 --> 00:44:34.900
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

609
00:44:36.635 --> 00:44:38.762
What the fuck happened?

610
00:44:38.887 --> 00:44:41.056
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?

611
00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:43.600
Duncan... they killed him.

612
00:44:43.642 --> 00:44:45.644
They got the plane.

613
00:44:57.656 --> 00:45:00.559
Tell me, Skip: what kind
of a Keystone Cops operation

614
00:45:00.559 --> 00:45:01.547
you guys runnin' here, huh?

615
00:45:01.547 --> 00:45:03.879
And you! You, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

616
00:45:04.163 --> 00:45:06.123
Hey, he brought a gun
on the plane.

617
00:45:06.165 --> 00:45:07.614
If I knew the way
you guys run things,

618
00:45:07.614 --> 00:45:09.182
I would've told him
to bring a fuckin' Uzi on board!

619
00:45:09.182 --> 00:45:12.554
No one carries on these flights!
No one!

620
00:45:12.638 --> 00:45:14.590
He brought a gun on board
and he got himself killed.

621
00:45:14.631 --> 00:45:16.466
And in doing so, he compromised
the safety of my men!

622
00:45:16.592 --> 00:45:18.969
Your men are incompetent!

623
00:45:19.011 --> 00:45:22.306
They let themselves get taken over by
a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

624
00:45:22.347 --> 00:45:23.489
- I'm not gonna stand around...
- Guys!

625
00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:27.482
- and listen to this shit!
- Guys, guys. Let's work it out.

626
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.106
Okay. Okay.

627
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.528
So, uh,
what do we do now?

628
00:45:36.653 --> 00:45:38.697
What's the plan?
You, uh, you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?

629
00:45:38.822 --> 00:45:40.557
We're workin' on it.

630
00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:43.452
Contingency plans for something
like this don't exist.

631
00:45:43.535 --> 00:45:46.497
- The situation's never been contemplated.
- Well, you better start contemplating,

632
00:45:46.622 --> 00:45:51.273
'cause this is a situation that
needs to get unfucked right now!

633
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.547
I want a chopper. Make that a few of 'em.
They need to be armed.

634
00:45:56.162 --> 00:45:58.967
I don't care if it's National
Guard, Air Force, whatever.

635
00:45:59.238 --> 00:46:01.011
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

636
00:46:05.048 --> 00:46:06.984
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know.

637
00:46:07.026 --> 00:46:11.388
But this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

638
00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:15.659
- You sure?
- Love your work.

639
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:49.518
They're headed... southeast
toward Arizona.

640
00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:00.886
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

641
00:47:01.497 --> 00:47:05.013
That's too bad.
I liked Pinball.

642
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.704
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.

643
00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:10.646
Why you care?

644
00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.127
I got just as much ridin' on this as you.
We're all convicts here.

645
00:47:15.252 --> 00:47:17.212
<i>Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?</i>

646
00:47:17.296 --> 00:47:19.381
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

647
00:47:19.423 --> 00:47:22.551
Yes, I copy.
Identify yourself.

648
00:47:22.593 --> 00:47:26.430
<i>This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.</i>

649
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:30.058
Oh, agent Malloy. I'm so sorry
about your associate.

650
00:47:30.142 --> 00:47:33.645
Nothing is quite as sad as seeing
a grown man pissing his pants.

651
00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:35.739
Listen, Grissom,
you puny, fucking animal!

652
00:47:35.864 --> 00:47:38.534
<i>When I get through with you, you'll be
beggin' 'em for the electric chair.</i>

653
00:47:38.575 --> 00:47:40.703
Hey, I don't like him.

654
00:47:40.744 --> 00:47:43.747
<i>If he speaks again, this
conversation is terminated.</i>

655
00:47:43.872 --> 00:47:47.084
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.

656
00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:48.594
He's leaving the building, okay?

657
00:47:48.629 --> 00:47:51.005
Good, then I'll talk to you.
Here are the rules.

658
00:47:51.088 --> 00:47:53.882
First I ask a question,
then you ask a question.

659
00:47:53.924 --> 00:47:55.592
Okay.
What's your question?

660
00:47:55.718 --> 00:47:58.887
In Carson City, your bulls
were onto us. How?

661
00:47:58.929 --> 00:48:02.224
- One of the guards...
- One of the guards...

662
00:48:02.266 --> 00:48:06.228
One of the guards faked a heart attack
and we had to remove his restraints.

663
00:48:06.353 --> 00:48:08.073
All right?

664
00:48:08.439 --> 00:48:10.399
I see.
And what's your question?

665
00:48:10.905 --> 00:48:12.735
Where you goin'
with my plane, Cyrus?

666
00:48:12.776 --> 00:48:15.779
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

667
00:48:16.304 --> 00:48:20.075
So are you, Vince.
<i>♪ Oh, nothin' ♪</i>

668

<i>♪ airplane. ♪</i>

670
00:48:29.218 --> 00:48:32.888
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

671
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.550
Forty-nine minutes from anything
resembling authority.

672
00:48:36.634 --> 00:48:39.094
So, now you know.

673
00:48:39.336 --> 00:48:42.089
<i>Your attention, please.
Flight 475...</i>

674
00:48:42.172 --> 00:48:45.801
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.

675
00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:54.476
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.

676
00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:57.145
My name's Grant,
U.S. Marshal Service.

677
00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:59.650
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.

678
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:01.112
Your presence is requested.

679
00:49:01.191 --> 00:49:03.948
I have a jet standing by.

680
00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:14.071
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

681
00:49:14.154 --> 00:49:17.376
What was I thinkin' about?

682
00:49:17.457 --> 00:49:20.002
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

683
00:49:20.043 --> 00:49:24.006
I was just wonderin' what
a black militant, uh, that would be you,

684
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:27.551
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

685
00:49:27.676 --> 00:49:29.193
Don't you think that's strange?

686
00:49:29.193 --> 00:49:32.037
It's a means to an end,
my white friend.

687
00:49:32.072 --> 00:49:34.183
A means to an end.
See...

688
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:37.686
I's can play house nigger till's
we get to where we're goin'.

689
00:49:38.303 --> 00:49:41.991
And then,
the day of the dog begins.

690
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.335
So what was that all about?

691
00:49:53.377 --> 00:49:56.171
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed

692
00:49:56.213 --> 00:50:00.509
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane...

693
00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:04.638
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over...

694
00:50:04.722 --> 00:50:08.851
and then somehow managed
to stick us right smack in the middle.

695
00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:17.526
Hi, Garland.

696
00:50:20.487 --> 00:50:24.259
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

697
00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.210
U.S. Ranger, highly decorated.

698
00:50:26.293 --> 00:50:28.129
Did a little hell-raising when
he was a kid, but nothing serious.

699
00:50:28.412 --> 00:50:30.255
Explain to me
why any of this matters.

700
00:50:30.255 --> 00:50:32.720
Fact one. We got a plane up there filled
with killers, rapists and thieves

701
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.378
and we got this guy Cameron Poe,
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.

702
00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.423
Non-gang affiliated.
He's a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

703
00:50:39.706 --> 00:50:42.852
Fact two. Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

704
00:50:42.977 --> 00:50:45.479
Doesn't do it. Why?

705
00:50:45.563 --> 00:50:49.191
Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe

706
00:50:49.316 --> 00:50:51.569
planted Sims's
tape recorder on him.

707
00:50:51.735 --> 00:50:52.929
These are interesting facts.

708
00:50:52.929 --> 00:50:57.411
You do the math on this...
and we got an ally on that plane.

709
00:50:57.446 --> 00:51:00.352
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

710
00:51:00.394 --> 00:51:04.749
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

711
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.441
Could have happened to any one of us,
including you and me.

712
00:51:06.683 --> 00:51:08.393
I am not one
of these animals.

713
00:51:08.477 --> 00:51:11.146
Oh, that's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

714
00:51:11.229 --> 00:51:14.441
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

715
00:51:14.677 --> 00:51:18.445
"The degree of civilization in a society
can be judged by observing its prisoners."

716
00:51:18.528 --> 00:51:21.248
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

717
00:51:21.331 --> 00:51:25.686
"Fuck you!" Cyrus Grissom said that
after putting a bullet in my agent's head. Okay?

718
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.589
The issue here is how the plane
is brought down.

719
00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:30.485
Shoot it down.

720
00:51:30.716 --> 00:51:34.720
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

721
00:51:34.803 --> 00:51:37.431
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

722
00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:40.267
I am authorized to bring agent Sims's
killers to justice using,

723
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.312
and I quote,
"All necessary means".

724
00:51:43.395 --> 00:51:46.315
- That does not include shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

725
00:51:46.398 --> 00:51:49.151
Is that right? Tell me you're
not seriously entertaining this.

726
00:51:49.234 --> 00:51:51.945
Vince, this is
a drastic situation we got.

727
00:51:52.029 --> 00:51:52.968
Those are our men up there!

728
00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:56.008
All of whom signed a no-hostage
clause. They know the score.

729
00:51:56.043 --> 00:51:57.531
Who are you to decide
the value of a man's life?

730
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.031
There are
innocent people up there!

731
00:51:59.166 --> 00:52:01.059
About time.

732
00:52:02.506 --> 00:52:06.827
- For what? About time for what?
- Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

733
00:52:11.724 --> 00:52:14.935
Goddamn it!
Skip, don't do this!

734
00:52:15.019 --> 00:52:18.180
This man is in an irrational state of mind!
His head isn't on straight.

735
00:52:18.305 --> 00:52:22.142
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

736
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:36.156
Gentlemen, in roughly five hours,
we will be flying over the shores of Mexico.

737
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:39.159
<i>But first we have
to change aircraft.</i>

738
00:52:39.284 --> 00:52:41.662
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

739
00:52:41.703 --> 00:52:46.834
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes.

740
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:50.546
The only problem is we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

741
00:52:50.671 --> 00:52:51.922
We're draggin', baby.

742
00:52:51.922 --> 00:52:54.520
The landing gear ain't all
the way up. We're gonna be late.

743
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.645
- No, no, no. Cyrus, that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

744
00:52:57.686 --> 00:52:59.590
What the hell do I know
about landing gear?

745
00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:00.858
Learn.

746
00:53:04.092 --> 00:53:06.149
Hillbilly!

747
00:53:06.178 --> 00:53:07.933
Poe.

748
00:53:12.484 --> 00:53:13.333
Yeah?

749
00:53:13.584 --> 00:53:16.427
Cyrus wants you to check out
the landing gear.

750
00:53:16.462 --> 00:53:19.855
Then I'll get to see some nice scenery
whippin' by down there.

751
00:53:24.997 --> 00:53:26.874
Trees and stuff.

752
00:53:47.209 --> 00:53:50.230
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

753
00:53:50.472 --> 00:53:53.767
Cut him loose. He's slowin'
us down. Dead weight.

754
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:56.436
Not exactly a proper burial.

755
00:53:56.561 --> 00:53:58.822
Look at our shit over there.

756
00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:20.302
Hurry up.

757
00:54:22.888 --> 00:54:24.932
Hillbilly.

758
00:54:25.257 --> 00:54:26.842
Gotcha.

759
00:54:28.135 --> 00:54:30.572
Hurry up, man.

760
00:54:36.435 --> 00:54:39.126
Bye, Pinball.

761
00:54:52.292 --> 00:54:55.295
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

762
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.823
Every time we get her waxed,

763
00:54:56.823 --> 00:55:00.560
I get ten feet from the car wash
and then, pow, bird shit.

764
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.418
Well, it's supposed to be
good luck.

765
00:55:06.098 --> 00:55:08.600
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

766
00:55:31.952 --> 00:55:33.801
- You were in the "Q", right?
- Yeah.

767
00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:37.346
And I heard you say
you had 15 years.

768
00:55:38.839 --> 00:55:40.507
That's right.

769
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:44.678
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

770
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:47.723
Yeah.

771
00:55:47.848 --> 00:55:50.392
Yeah. Funny thing.

772
00:55:50.534 --> 00:55:55.555
I was on north block.
I don't know you.

773
00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:58.859
You know what,
uh, pal?

774
00:55:58.901 --> 00:56:03.530
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly shit.

775
00:56:03.614 --> 00:56:06.033
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block

776
00:56:06.074 --> 00:56:10.537
and I didn't want to know 159
of them, which included you.

777
00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:13.108
What do you think
about that?

778
00:56:13.123 --> 00:56:15.083
Yeah.

779
00:56:23.091 --> 00:56:25.761
He's a font
of misplaced rage.

780
00:56:26.233 --> 00:56:30.065
Name your cliche. Mother held him
too much, or not enough.

781
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.901
Last picked at kick ball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

782
00:56:34.778 --> 00:56:38.574
Now he's so angry, moments of
levity actually 'cause him pain.

783
00:56:39.942 --> 00:56:41.568
Gives him headaches.

784
00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:44.479
Happiness, for
that gentleman, hurts.

785
00:56:45.405 --> 00:56:47.449
What's wrong with him?

786
00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:50.744
My first thought would be... a lot.

787
00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:55.165
- Hello.
- Hello.

788
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.501
- Hi. I'm... I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

789
00:56:57.626 --> 00:57:01.171
Nice to meet ya.
This... this must be Casey.

790
00:57:01.296 --> 00:57:03.361
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.

791
00:57:03.361 --> 00:57:06.779
Nice to meet ya.
So how are... you doin'?

792
00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:09.596
I'm sorry. That's, uh...
Scratch that. Dumb question. You...

793
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.141
wanted to see your husband today,
and then... this whole thing happened.

794
00:57:13.267 --> 00:57:16.603
Maybe you could just tell me
exactly what's goin' on here.

795
00:57:16.645 --> 00:57:19.648
We're doin' everything we can
to get the plane down.

796
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:23.462
Actually, that's w-why I wanted
to talk to you.

797
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.691
Hey, wait. W-where'd you get
the rims, man?

798
00:57:29.816 --> 00:57:32.819
My personal shit's
down in the belly.

799
00:57:34.254 --> 00:57:36.840
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

800
00:57:37.366 --> 00:57:39.035
Men!

801
00:57:45.738 --> 00:57:48.936
It seems that your husband,
Cameron,

802
00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:51.638
had an opportunity to get off
the plane and he didn't do it.

803
00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.308
And I was hoping
you could...

804
00:57:54.391 --> 00:57:57.978
maybe help me
figure out... why.

805
00:57:58.205 --> 00:58:01.095
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

806
00:58:01.323 --> 00:58:03.367
I mean, it's possible,
it's... it's not uncommon

807
00:58:03.492 --> 00:58:07.371
that some parolees actually...
fear their release date.

808
00:58:07.496 --> 00:58:11.125
A certain degree of institutionalization
sets in. Fear of comin' home.

809
00:58:11.208 --> 00:58:12.585
Fear of livin' in society...

810
00:58:12.585 --> 00:58:14.012
- Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

811
00:58:14.236 --> 00:58:17.831
That's not Cameron. I mean, if you...
if you knew him, if you read his letters

812
00:58:17.873 --> 00:58:20.667
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that...

813
00:58:20.751 --> 00:58:25.005
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna...

814
00:58:27.424 --> 00:58:32.012
I mean, look, he's got this little...
this little girl to come home to.

815
00:58:33.889 --> 00:58:36.183
Wouldn't you...

816
00:58:36.266 --> 00:58:38.352
do the same thing?

817
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.358
There'd have to be a pretty strong reason
to keep me on that plane.

818
00:58:44.657 --> 00:58:47.528
Well, knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

819
00:58:49.696 --> 00:58:54.451
Uh, maybe, if you... if you do
see him or if you talk to him,

820
00:58:54.576 --> 00:58:58.747
maybe you could just...
tell him to come home, all right?

821
00:58:58.872 --> 00:59:01.208
Be kinda nice
to have him around.

822
00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:03.984
You got it.

823
00:59:05.295 --> 00:59:07.464
Vince, line one.

824
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.885
This body fell out
of the sky.

825
00:59:11.927 --> 00:59:16.223
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

826
00:59:16.306 --> 00:59:18.438
<i>We got a problem here
with a corpse.</i>

827
00:59:18.797 --> 00:59:19.549
Uh-huh.

828
00:59:19.902 --> 00:59:21.570
<i>Yeah, it fell out of the sky.</i>

829
00:59:21.895 --> 00:59:23.814
I don't think
he's an astronaut.

830
00:59:23.939 --> 00:59:25.942
Then what's this got
to do with me?

831
00:59:27.067 --> 00:59:29.736
It's got your name
written all over it.

832
00:59:35.075 --> 00:59:37.911
Last transponder tag
was in Arizona.

833
00:59:37.953 --> 00:59:40.330
Body falls here, in Fresno.

834
00:59:40.455 --> 00:59:43.250
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

835
00:59:43.292 --> 00:59:44.918
- They're comin' back. Can you get me Chief...
- Devers.

836
00:59:45.002 --> 00:59:46.756
Please. Thank you.

837
00:59:47.087 --> 00:59:49.339
- Vince?
- Turn around.

838
00:59:49.464 --> 00:59:52.259
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield.
It's a small strip about 100 miles from here.

839
00:59:52.342 --> 00:59:56.138
Horseshit! We're tailing the
transponder tag into Arizona.

840
00:59:56.263 --> 00:59:58.599
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

841
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.101
It had a note on it.

842
01:00:01.143 --> 01:00:04.146
We got 'em vectored
at 12 o'clock and 30 miles.

843
01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:08.275
- Vince, please, son. We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

844
01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:10.777
<i>It was to me!
The note on the body was to me!</i>

845
01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:13.230
<i>- You're chasing the wrong..
- Aw, shut up.</i>

846
01:00:13.355 --> 01:00:14.648
Hello?

847
01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:18.757
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

848
01:00:18.757 --> 01:00:21.098
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

849
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:23.924
I gotta get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

850
01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.335
Got a fast car,
you can drive it.

851
01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:32.716
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

852
01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.469
Send whatever you got.
Sheriff, state trooper, national guard...

853
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.971
Hold on one minute.

854
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.227
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

855
01:00:43.352 --> 01:00:45.813
It's only a matter of time
before they find the weapons hold.

856
01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:52.903
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

857
01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:54.905
How do you think
I got the number?

858
01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:04.206
"...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that..."

859
01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:07.586
Poe.

860
01:01:08.043 --> 01:01:11.380
Man! Oh, yeah!

861
01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:15.551
Put the bunny
back in the box.

862
01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:21.181
I knew you was a punk.
And I was right.

863
01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:24.434
You been playin' us
all along.

864
01:01:24.518 --> 01:01:27.062
You a free man.

865
01:01:27.346 --> 01:01:31.224
I said, put the bunny

866
01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:33.810
back in the box.

867
01:02:04.966 --> 01:02:07.177
Die, punk!

868
01:02:15.647 --> 01:02:18.872
Why couldn't you put the bunny
back in the box?

869
01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:24.962
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.

870
01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.126
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

871
01:02:33.245 --> 01:02:35.891
Holy shit!

872
01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:39.292
Abort! Abort! Abort!

873
01:02:39.566 --> 01:02:43.614
<i>If that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.</i>

874
01:02:44.657 --> 01:02:48.035
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours."

875
01:02:49.445 --> 01:02:51.035
Shit!

876
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:56.902
Three hundred fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

877
01:02:56.934 --> 01:02:59.422
We need to get
to Lerner Airfield now!

878
01:03:00.048 --> 01:03:01.715
Get me Vince Larkin.

879
01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:15.237
Two went down,
one came up.

880
01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.573
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

881
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.009
Most murders are crimes
of necessity rather than desire.

882
01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:25.347
But the great ones,
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...

883
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.942
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you...?

884
01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:31.854
I got nothin' in common
with them, with you.

885
01:03:31.937 --> 01:03:35.399
Don't you talk to me!
They were insane.

886
01:03:36.124 --> 01:03:39.150
Now you're talking
semantics.

887
01:03:39.311 --> 01:03:41.559
What if I told you insane
was working 50 hours a week

888
01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:45.823
in some office for 50 years
at the end of which they tell you to piss off?

889
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:47.970
Ending up
in some retirement village...

890
01:03:48.053 --> 01:03:50.102
hoping to die before
suffering the indignity

891
01:03:50.102 --> 01:03:52.528
of tryin' to make
it to the toilet on time.

892
01:03:54.543 --> 01:03:56.795
Wouldn't you consider that
to be insane?

893
01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:02.851
Murderin' 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane!

894
01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:05.854
One girl...

895
01:04:05.938 --> 01:04:08.223
I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

896
01:04:08.307 --> 01:04:11.268
It's my daughter's birthday
today.

897
01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:14.438
So please feel free
not to share everything with me.

898
01:05:15.499 --> 01:05:19.503
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.

899
01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:21.922
<i>We're puttin' this baby
down in a sandbox.</i>

900
01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:33.219
Lerner Tower,
do you copy?

901
01:05:33.534 --> 01:05:36.387
<i>Lerner Tower,
are you there, Phil?</i>

902
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.485
<i>Come on, answer me.</i>

903
01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:46.138
<i>I am landing.</i>

904
01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.477
Oh, my God.

905
01:06:16.771 --> 01:06:18.172
Look out!

906
01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:35.973
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

907
01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.937
Thank you
for choosing Con Air.

908
01:07:43.614 --> 01:07:47.785
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

909
01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:49.928
The last guy who told me
to have patience?

910
01:07:49.928 --> 01:07:52.058
I burned him down,
and bagged his ashes.

911
01:07:52.058 --> 01:07:53.791
Cyrus, it'll be here.

912
01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:04.885
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

913
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:13.635
I hope he likes sand.

914
01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:16.576
Muchacho, run and check out the
tower. Have a look-see, yeah?

915
01:08:16.576 --> 01:08:17.410
All right.

916
01:08:17.445 --> 01:08:18.932
You come with us.

917
01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:25.206
- Let's go. We're gettin' off.
- Boss, I can't.

918
01:08:25.206 --> 01:08:26.142
Yes, you can. Come on!

919
01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:28.492
- You shouldn't move him.
- I'm gettin' him off of this plane.

920
01:08:28.575 --> 01:08:32.579
You... you can't move him.
He's too far along. He could go into shock.

921
01:08:32.663 --> 01:08:34.957
Ah, she's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

922
01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.618
I'm not leavin'
without you, or you.

923
01:08:37.701 --> 01:08:40.662
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

924
01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:44.041
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

925
01:08:44.124 --> 01:08:46.710
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck or hit the fence.

926
01:08:46.793 --> 01:08:49.254
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

927
01:08:49.765 --> 01:08:51.185
Just go.

928
01:08:51.598 --> 01:08:55.177
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

929
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.971
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

930
01:08:58.055 --> 01:08:59.309
Fuck.

931
01:08:59.523 --> 01:09:02.318
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

932
01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:07.972
<i>♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪</i>

933
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.200
<i>♪ Comin' for
to carry me home ♪</i>

934
01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:15.188
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

935
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:18.025
- It's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

936
01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:21.069
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

937
01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:25.949
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

938
01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:30.037
I can't think of a thing
I'd like... better

939
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.541
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

940
01:09:34.624 --> 01:09:38.587
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

941
01:09:38.712 --> 01:09:41.798
I mean, I don't know him that
well myself. Just what I read.

942
01:09:41.923 --> 01:09:43.779
Like how he firebombed
that senator's yacht

943
01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.906
with two of his own cousins
on board.

944
01:09:45.906 --> 01:09:47.112
So what's your point?

945
01:09:47.196 --> 01:09:49.086
Why would he sweat
about killin' some hired guns

946
01:09:49.086 --> 01:09:50.179
once they'd served his purpose?

947
01:09:50.179 --> 01:09:53.661
- Now think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?

948
01:09:53.944 --> 01:09:56.363
Poe don't want me
to off the pigs.

949
01:09:56.646 --> 01:10:00.400
Well, it's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards.

950
01:10:00.484 --> 01:10:03.070
And my own proclivities
are, uh...

951
01:10:03.153 --> 01:10:08.075
well-known and, uh,
often-lamented facts of penal lore.

952
01:10:08.217 --> 01:10:11.495
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

953
01:10:11.578 --> 01:10:14.414
Cyrus, this is your barbecue,
man, and it tastes good.

954
01:10:14.456 --> 01:10:18.635
But I was just sayin' to Mr... Dog
over here, that if it was my barbecue

955
01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:21.027
I'd wait for that
old jumbo jet in the sky

956
01:10:21.027 --> 01:10:22.451
before I start
killin' our only leverage.

957
01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:23.358
Shut the fuck up!

958
01:10:23.358 --> 01:10:25.696
Don't you want to get high
and get laid? No shit!

959
01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:26.694
Oh, fuck this!

960
01:10:26.777 --> 01:10:31.323
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

961
01:10:31.407 --> 01:10:34.128
Poe's right.
We're goin' to Plan "B".

962
01:10:34.545 --> 01:10:37.112
Gonna get a refuelling truck
and a tractor.

963
01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:39.615
So get back there
and dig the plane out.

964
01:10:56.724 --> 01:11:01.507
No. Yes!

965
01:11:17.194 --> 01:11:20.726
Viking, 'bout time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?

966
01:11:20.726 --> 01:11:22.017
Right.

967
01:11:23.534 --> 01:11:26.286
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

968
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.122
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

969
01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:33.035
"Many hands make light work."
My daddy taught me that.

970
01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.662
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

971
01:11:35.746 --> 01:11:39.791
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

972
01:11:42.335 --> 01:11:45.514
- Have you found Vince Larkin?
- We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

973
01:11:45.639 --> 01:11:48.350
Of course, you're having trouble
reaching him!

974
01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:53.063
He's off savin' the rain forest
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

975
01:12:27.297 --> 01:12:29.443
Holy shit!

976
01:12:35.939 --> 01:12:39.359
Hey! We got company!

977
01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:41.487
Hey!

978
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.114
We got company!

979
01:12:45.449 --> 01:12:47.328
Go get Cyrus.

980
01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:49.637
Yo, Cyrus!

981
01:12:57.044 --> 01:12:59.087
How long we got
till they get here, Nathan?

982
01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:02.317
Ten, twelve minutes tops.

983
01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:14.853
Hey, what's your name?
Wanna play?

984
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.408
Nice jet.

985
01:13:28.492 --> 01:13:31.745
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.

986
01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:37.808
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it. Comprendre, esse?

987
01:13:41.163 --> 01:13:44.675
Hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

988
01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:46.593
Freeze!

989
01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:08.073
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

990
01:14:08.157 --> 01:14:10.951
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

991
01:14:11.127 --> 01:14:13.287
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

992
01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:16.323
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

993
01:14:16.634 --> 01:14:18.058
Uh-huh. In a minute.

994
01:14:19.225 --> 01:14:22.996
Listen, Poe...
Can I lower this?

995
01:14:23.238 --> 01:14:25.924
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

996
01:14:26.008 --> 01:14:29.136
Sorry, boss, but there's only
two men I trust.

997
01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:31.638
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

998
01:14:33.607 --> 01:14:35.738
So Cindino was running
a drag on everyone.

999
01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:37.446
Yeah.

1000
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:40.790
If you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust, huh?

1001
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.888
That was a joke.

1002
01:14:43.888 --> 01:14:47.067
I'm glad you told me.
Now I gotta get back to the plane.

1003
01:14:48.572 --> 01:14:51.533
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

1004
01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:54.995
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

1005
01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:57.145
You got a friend on board...

1006
01:14:57.989 --> 01:15:01.574
See, I knew I was right
about you. I read your file.

1007
01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:05.422
You're not such a bad guy. Just always
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1008
01:15:05.506 --> 01:15:07.674
Goodbye... Larkin.

1009
01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:11.805
I spoke to your wife.

1010
01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:20.813
- In person?
- In person.

1011
01:15:21.855 --> 01:15:23.774
And your little girl.

1012
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:31.258
- You... saw Casey?
- Uh-huh.

1013
01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.370
If this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter

1014
01:15:36.411 --> 01:15:39.251
won't... understand.

1015
01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:43.553
If you talk to my wife again,
you tell her...

1016
01:15:44.127 --> 01:15:45.965
I love her.

1017
01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:49.509
She's my hummingbird.

1018
01:15:50.133 --> 01:15:54.660
But... I couldn't leave
a fallen man behind.

1019
01:15:57.307 --> 01:16:00.394
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Larkin?

1020
01:16:00.477 --> 01:16:04.648
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

1021
01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:07.151
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

1022
01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:09.236
I'm gonna save
the fuckin' day.

1023
01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:27.296
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

1024
01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:30.097
I want this airplane out now.

1025
01:16:31.201 --> 01:16:32.449
Come on, men!

1026
01:16:47.259 --> 01:16:50.544
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

1027
01:16:54.323 --> 01:16:56.617
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

1028
01:17:01.497 --> 01:17:04.173
Are you sick?

1029
01:17:04.825 --> 01:17:08.286
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

1030
01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.342
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

1031
01:17:13.467 --> 01:17:15.594
There is no medicine
for what I have.

1032
01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:19.932
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

1033
01:17:20.015 --> 01:17:22.643
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

1034
01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:25.354
Yes, I do.

1035
01:17:25.448 --> 01:17:29.306
<i>♪ He's got the whole world
in His hands ♪</i>

1036
01:17:29.315 --> 01:17:32.096
<i>♪ He's got

1037
01:17:32.252 --> 01:17:34.212
Come on.

1038
01:17:34.286 --> 01:17:39.199
<i>♪ He's got the whole world

1039
01:17:39.308 --> 01:17:43.479

1040
01:17:43.687 --> 01:17:48.066
<i>♪ He's got the whole world

1041
01:17:48.275 --> 01:17:52.133
<i>♪ He's got the whole world

1042
01:18:10.402 --> 01:18:12.693
It's on the ground. Repeat.
The plane is on the ground.

1043
01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:14.936
But it won't be for long.
Where the hell are ya?

1044
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.105
We're westbound
near the Lerner cutoff.

1045
01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:50.063
Where's Cindino?

1046
01:18:53.275 --> 01:18:55.652
That's my fuckin' plane!

1047
01:19:41.498 --> 01:19:43.417
Cyrus, help me.

1048
01:19:47.254 --> 01:19:50.924
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were... We were coming to get you.

1049
01:19:53.969 --> 01:19:55.729
Please.

1050
01:19:56.213 --> 01:19:57.923
- Cy...
- ...onara.

1051
01:19:58.006 --> 01:20:00.425
No!

1052
01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:42.434
- Don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

1053
01:20:42.559 --> 01:20:44.745
Listen, I need a syringe.

1054
01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:48.199
Oh, no!
Drugs'll end you, son.

1055
01:20:48.282 --> 01:20:50.367
Is there a first aid kit
around here?

1056
01:20:50.451 --> 01:20:53.320
Well, there might be one in
the fire truck over on the boneyard.

1057
01:20:53.404 --> 01:20:57.887
All right, thanks. You just stay here
and don't panic.

1058
01:20:57.950 --> 01:21:01.078
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

1059
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.377
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1060
01:21:17.899 --> 01:21:18.841
Lock and load!

1061
01:21:22.975 --> 01:21:26.604
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

1062
01:21:26.687 --> 01:21:30.482
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.

1063
01:21:30.608 --> 01:21:32.484
This is our plane.

1064
01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:36.363
- What's that?
- That's a rock.

1065
01:21:36.849 --> 01:21:37.894
Okay.

1066
01:21:38.524 --> 01:21:41.902
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.

1067
01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:45.405
Initially, we take out the first car.
Then we take out the last,

1068
01:21:45.489 --> 01:21:48.325
creating a trap,
an airtight cage

1069
01:21:48.408 --> 01:21:51.587
filled with lots and lots
of dead people.

1070
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:54.428
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?

1071
01:21:56.404 --> 01:21:58.734
Bring me
those propane tanks.

1072
01:22:01.013 --> 01:22:03.161
Whoo, go girl.

1073
01:22:04.224 --> 01:22:07.353
Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.
if they give you any trouble, kill 'em.

1074
01:22:10.564 --> 01:22:12.250
What can I do?

1075
01:22:12.483 --> 01:22:15.694
Take this.
Go into the boneyard, yeah?

1076
01:22:15.819 --> 01:22:18.414
Anybody gets through,
you scratch their eyes out.

1077
01:22:18.414 --> 01:22:20.010
You got it.

1078
01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:14.329
Come on, little piggy.

1079
01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:35.065
Closer. Closer. Closer.

1080
01:23:42.114 --> 01:23:44.303
Christ.
They'll be slaughtered.

1081
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:50.264
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!

1082
01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:52.177
Now.

1083
01:24:23.038 --> 01:24:26.292
Come on, you stinking
piece-of-shit car!

1084
01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.483
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?

1085
01:24:35.668 --> 01:24:37.836
Well, Baby-O...

1086
01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.507
it's not exactly Mai tais
and Yahtzee out here, but...

1087
01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.694
let's do it!

1088
01:24:56.522 --> 01:24:59.191
Gonna see
what happens now, bitch!

1089
01:24:59.316 --> 01:25:00.818
Bishop.

1090
01:25:13.155 --> 01:25:16.033
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm gonna bust your ass!

1091
01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:21.705
Leave her alone, man!

1092
01:25:34.092 --> 01:25:35.861
Get behind the truck!

1093
01:25:35.986 --> 01:25:37.780
Get behind the truck!

1094
01:25:56.757 --> 01:26:00.529
When you wake up, Bishop,
I'll be Johnny 24.

1095
01:26:00.685 --> 01:26:02.066
You wanna fight somebody?

1096
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:24.652
Don't treat... women...
like... that!

1097
01:26:27.571 --> 01:26:29.114
Aw, shit!

1098
01:26:33.202 --> 01:26:34.620
Whoa! Whoa!

1099
01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:39.512
Get back to the plane!

1100
01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:43.829
Oh, my God!

1101
01:26:59.028 --> 01:27:00.888
Okay!

1102
01:27:02.356 --> 01:27:05.651
You might better
get yourself a seat now.

1103
01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:14.451
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.

1104
01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:21.834
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.

1105
01:27:28.465 --> 01:27:30.926
We're tied up!

1106
01:27:47.776 --> 01:27:50.362
- Now, come on!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

1107
01:27:53.616 --> 01:27:56.952
- Go for the tires!
- Fuck the tires! I'm goin' for the pilot!

1108
01:28:09.498 --> 01:28:11.416
Isn't that your car, Malloy?

1109
01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:14.353
Couldn't be.
I left mine at the office.

1110
01:28:17.806 --> 01:28:20.976
On any other day,
that might seem strange.

1111
01:28:32.988 --> 01:28:36.450
Gotta get her nose up!

1112
01:29:05.488 --> 01:29:07.682
Fuckers! Come on!

1113
01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:11.129
When this is over,
so are you, you little prick!

1114
01:29:11.129 --> 01:29:11.614
Okay.

1115
01:29:20.411 --> 01:29:22.371
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.

1116
01:29:30.513 --> 01:29:31.847
Go, girl!

1117
01:29:32.046 --> 01:29:34.344
<i>♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪</i>

1118
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:36.427
All right!

1119
01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:39.358
<i>♪ Where the skies
are so blue ♪</i>

1120
01:29:39.563 --> 01:29:41.999
Define irony.

1121
01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:44.476
Bunch of idiots
dancing on a plane

1122
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.690
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.

1123
01:30:22.514 --> 01:30:26.936
Someone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.

1124
01:30:27.019 --> 01:30:29.980
Someone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.

1125
01:30:30.105 --> 01:30:33.150
Someone even killed
poor Billy Bedlam.

1126
01:30:33.275 --> 01:30:38.238
Now, could this all
be coincidence? Perhaps.

1127
01:30:38.322 --> 01:30:42.117
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.

1128
01:30:42.201 --> 01:30:46.664
So, I ask you,
what is going on?

1129
01:30:46.789 --> 01:30:51.627
And I answer.
We have a traitor in our midst.

1130
01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:55.756
Now, how do we flush
a traitor?

1131
01:30:55.839 --> 01:30:58.476
I don't know,
but at the count of three...

1132
01:30:58.601 --> 01:31:01.220
I will find out who is
on my team and who is not.

1133
01:31:01.303 --> 01:31:03.355
That would be one, two...

1134
01:31:03.439 --> 01:31:06.410
Wait! It was me.

1135
01:31:07.309 --> 01:31:09.019
It was me.

1136
01:31:09.144 --> 01:31:13.148
Don't listen to him, man.
T-t-the insulin made him crazy.

1137
01:31:13.232 --> 01:31:16.160
You have been near death
the entire trip?

1138
01:31:16.285 --> 01:31:19.530
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's... he's flipped out, man. He's nuts.

1139
01:31:19.655 --> 01:31:21.490
It's pretty clever, huh, bitch?

1140
01:31:21.573 --> 01:31:25.369
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!

1141
01:31:28.672 --> 01:31:32.510
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th."

1142
01:31:32.835 --> 01:31:36.088
"My birthday is July 14th."

01:31:36.171 --> 01:31:39.466
"I'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever"

1144
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:43.178
"on... July 14th."

1145
01:31:43.462 --> 01:31:45.798
Make a move,
and the bunny gets it.

1146
01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:54.016
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!

1147
01:31:54.016 --> 01:31:55.482
Fire!

1148
01:31:56.091 --> 01:31:58.093
Goddamn it, Malloy!

1149
01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:02.439
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!

1150
01:32:05.409 --> 01:32:08.078
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!

1151
01:32:08.203 --> 01:32:10.414
You got it, agent Malloy?
You with me?

1152
01:32:10.539 --> 01:32:13.334
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?

1153
01:32:14.543 --> 01:32:16.886
I got a bad feeling, son.

1154
01:32:17.421 --> 01:32:20.111
I'm feelin' like maybe
I'm not supposed to make it.

1155
01:32:20.311 --> 01:32:22.085
You're gonna make it.

1156
01:32:23.469 --> 01:32:26.255
<i>Cyrus Grissom, this is
special agent Vince Larkin.</i>

1157
01:32:26.338 --> 01:32:30.759
<i>We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.</i>

1158
01:32:32.394 --> 01:32:36.523
All I can think about is like,
there ain't no God.

1159
01:32:36.607 --> 01:32:38.878
That He don't exist.

1160
01:32:41.737 --> 01:32:46.745
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I'm gonna show you God does exist!

1161
01:32:52.122 --> 01:32:53.460
Fire!

1162
01:32:53.999 --> 01:32:57.211
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!

1163
01:32:58.128 --> 01:32:59.340
Yes!

1164
01:33:02.424 --> 01:33:04.176
Freeze, little bitch boy!

1165
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:17.982
- Switch to missile.
- Roger that, Two.

1166
01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:19.608
<i>Arming missiles.</i>

1167
01:33:20.526 --> 01:33:22.778
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.

1168
01:33:22.861 --> 01:33:24.321
Shit!

1169
01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:28.092
What the hell
are you doing, Larkin?

1170
01:33:28.217 --> 01:33:30.661
- I got no move, sir.
- Stupid bastard!

1171
01:33:42.298 --> 01:33:46.929
- No! Poe!
- Land this thing!

1172
01:33:47.636 --> 01:33:51.223
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- I'm the new captain. Put this thing down.

1173
01:33:51.307 --> 01:33:52.975
Target locked, sir.

1174
01:33:53.258 --> 01:33:56.178
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!

1175
01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.355
<i>- Don't shoot!</i>
- Don't fire.

1176
01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.224
- Who is this?
- Identify yourself.

1177
01:34:00.349 --> 01:34:02.484
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes!

1178
01:34:02.526 --> 01:34:04.486
Poe!

1179
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:09.008
Poe!

1180
01:34:09.733 --> 01:34:13.946
- I repeat, target is locked, sir.
- Malloy, he's got the plane!

1181
01:34:14.029 --> 01:34:18.055
We're not over civilian population.
Now is the time, sir.

1182
01:34:18.867 --> 01:34:21.512
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!

1183
01:34:21.637 --> 01:34:24.673
He's just tryin' to get home
to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!

1184
01:34:24.757 --> 01:34:26.767
Now's the time, sir.

1185
01:34:28.886 --> 01:34:30.596
- Hold fire.
- Sir?

1186
01:34:30.679 --> 01:34:33.432
- I said hold fire!
- Thank you.

1187
01:34:37.953 --> 01:34:39.579
Poe!

1188
01:34:40.889 --> 01:34:42.066
Poe!

1189
01:34:42.191 --> 01:34:45.110
- Cyrus!
- What?

1190
01:34:51.116 --> 01:34:54.161
All right, Poe,
the Las Vegas Airport.

1191
01:34:54.244 --> 01:34:56.747
<i>It's just past the strip.
Can you see it?</i>

1192
01:34:56.872 --> 01:34:59.208
Well, viva Las Vegas.

1193
01:34:59.291 --> 01:35:00.904
It's right there, man.
You can make it.

1194
01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:03.138
All the runways are cleared.
Come on, do it, Poe.

1195
01:35:03.138 --> 01:35:04.951
Put this thing down.

1196
01:35:05.214 --> 01:35:08.926
Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit,

1197
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:12.054
zero fuel,
and we're droppin' too fast.

1198
01:35:12.137 --> 01:35:17.353
The strip's where I'm gonna land.
Only the word is... crash.

1199
01:35:18.602 --> 01:35:20.729
Should've shot 'em down
over the open desert, Larkin.

1200
01:35:20.813 --> 01:35:22.940
Now the civilian casualties
will be enormous.

1201
01:35:29.438 --> 01:35:33.620

- Can he make it to the airport?
- No way, sir.

1207
01:35:57.641 --> 01:36:00.276
All right. We're gonna need
police cars, uh, fire engines,

1218
01:37:24.303 --> 01:37:26.430
Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know

1219
01:37:26.513 --> 01:37:30.350
that the last thing that
little Casey Poe ever gets to smell

1220

You're gonna be fine.

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.367
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

1226
01:39:47.538 --> 01:39:49.379
So what are you
gonna do now?

1227
01:39:49.999 --> 01:39:55.004
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and... I'm gonna get to it.

1228
01:40:02.568 --> 01:40:06.170

1230
01:40:11.566 --> 01:40:13.355

shoot it down, huh?
