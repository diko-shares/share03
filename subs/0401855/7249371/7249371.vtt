[man 1 ] <i>My God.
Brother, what have you done?</i>

10
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:51.612
Yet again we arrive
to witness this monster's aftermath.

11
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.659
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

12
00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.953
Your brother must be stopped.

13
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.205
It ends tonight.

14
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.167
We must move quickly, before they turn.

15
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.631
Is he still here?

16
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.341
Yes.

17
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.719
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

18
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.055
I gave you my word, did I not?

19
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.807
But William must be controlled.

20
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.687
Burn the bodies.

21
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.856
Search the outbuildings.

[man 2] Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

- Marcus.

24
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.904
Stay with me.

25
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.946
Give me the torch.

- Retreat to the woods.
- I will stay and fight. You need my help.

37
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.140
I need you alive.

38
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.475
If you die, we all die.

39
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.810
Now, go.

40
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.230
- Go!
- Hyah.

41
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.463
- We found him.
- And?

42
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.174
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

43
00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.477
[man] Amelia, we found William.

44
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.589
[Amelia in distance] Surround him!

No.

49
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.023
Leave him be.

50
00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.112
Stop this. You're killing him.

[Viktor] Marcus!

55
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.397
He was not to be harmed.

56
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:24.069
Place him in my charge as we agreed,
or you will pay for your deceit.

57
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.696
And you will learn your place.

58
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.283
Your sympathy for this beast is foolish.

59
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.203
Your brother is entirely beyond control.

60
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.829
It will be done my way.

61
00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:38.124
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

62
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.043
or William.

63
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:43.588
If you so much as speak his name again,

64
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.132
you will have chosen that future for him.

65
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.645
What is thy will... my lord?

66
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.816
Imprisonment for all time.

67

This thing's been dead for weeks.

102
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.396
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

103
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.524
They do. This one's been given a serum
to stop regression

104
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.734

Ah. Not quite your department, I guess.

- Just.
- Okay, let's get what we need and go.

The blood memories

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.760

132
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.229

If I can plead my case,

143
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.192
there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

144
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.862
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

145
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.905
So, what am I supposed to do,
sit and wait?

146
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.657
No, Kraven may still have his men
with him.

147
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.700
You're not going alone.

148
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.785
You're not as strong as you might think.

149
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.663
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

150
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.915
There's never been a hybrid before.

151
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.709
However ambivalent
you might feel about it,

152
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.752
the truth is
your powers could be limitless.

153
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.839
But you depend on blood. You need to feed.

154
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.301
Without it, you'll grow weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

156
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.347

What if I can't?

158

Normal food could be lethal.

159
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.980
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

160
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.649
And believe me,
you don't want that on your conscience.

161
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.736
There really is no going back, Michael.

162
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.615
I'm sorry.

I probably need just a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

To do what?

And so once Viktor's army was turned,

the legions of Vampires under his control
tracked down and destroyed the animals,

466
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.216
then captured William

467
00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:41.301

Why let him live?

For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: fear.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.399
He was warned that,
should Marcus ever be killed,

all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

So in Viktor's mind,

474
00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:04.241
William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans,

475

to put to the test.

You can go.

[in English]
You're familiar with this, then?

556
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.330
Intimately.

557
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.506
You're Alexander Corvinus.

558
01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:25.432
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

559
01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.896
By any name, I am still your forefather.

560
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.362
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

561
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:43.074
For centuries,
I've stood by and watched the havoc

562
01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:48.079
my sons have wrought
upon each other and upon humanity.

563
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.166
Not the legacy I prayed for

564
01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.585
the morning I watched them
enter this world.

565
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.172
And a tiresome duty

566
01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.425
keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess,

567
01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.763
hiding my family's unfortunate history.

568
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.265
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

569
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.644
Could you kill your own sons?

570
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.979
You know what Marcus will do.

571
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.899
If he finds me, he finds William's prison.

572
01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.735
You need to help us stop him.

573
01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:23.531
You are asking me to help you kill my son?

574
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.283
You?

575
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.160
A Death Dealer?

576
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.371
How many innocents did you kill

577
01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.290
in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

578
01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:35.043
Spare me your self-righteous declarations.

579
01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.381
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

580
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.343
At least he cannot control his savagery.

581
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.971
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

582
01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.015
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability

583
01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:53.645
to accept that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

584
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.438
You could've stopped all of this.

585
01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.148
Do not come groveling to me

586
01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:00.944
simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

587
01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.155
You know the devastation William caused
before he was captured.

588
01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:05.532
He cannot be set free.

No.

604
01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.204
They've gone. There, there, my child.

Look at me.

610
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.345
Michael.

611
01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.639
Shit.

612
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.708
Please.

Please.

614

Come on.

615

Come on.

Hello, Father.

620
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:57.448
You are unwelcome in my presence.

621
01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.492
Ah.

622
01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.454
The predictable heart that never thaws.

623
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.250
Pity it beats within such a fool.

624
01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.878
The eldest of the immortals,

625
01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.508
yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

626
01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:20.388
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

627
01:08:21.222 --> 01:08:23.600
This is a world for humanity.

628
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.520
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

629
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:30.732
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium

630
01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:33.568
as William suffered alone in darkness?

631
01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.029
No, Father.

632
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.366
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

633
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:45.788
Viktor's key. Where is it?

634
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.541
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

635
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.586
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

636
01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.465
And our bond is greater
than you have ever wanted to acknowledge.

637
01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.674
You're wrong.

638
01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.511
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

639
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.096
Oh, not Lycans, Father,

640
01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:04.015
or Vampires.

641
01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:08.811
A new race,
created in the image of their maker...

642
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.939
their new god:

643
01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:15.735
me.

Please, sir, let us help you.

The time has come, my friend.

653
01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.474
Find the girl.

654
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.310
Bring her to me.

655
01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.817
No, wait. Wait.

656
01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.574
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

Don't leave him here.

658
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.855
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

659
01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.151
He's too powerful for you alone.

660
01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.946
You are the only one older than he is,

661
01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.697
the only one stronger.

662
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.075

664
01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.541
he is my son.

You are the last hope left.

666
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.262
There is only one way to defeat him.

667
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.437
Quickly, now,

668
01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.441

left in my veins.

669
01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:53.327
