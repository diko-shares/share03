1
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.914
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

2
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:51.605
Yet again we arrive
to witness this monster's aftermath.

3
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.652
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

4
00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:59.950
Your brother must be stopped.

5
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.195
It ends tonight.

6
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.156
We must move quickly, before they turn.

7
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.620
Is he still here?

8
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.340
Yes.

9
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.716
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

10
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.043
I gave you my word, did I not?

11
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.800
But William must be controlled.

12
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.684
Burn the bodies.

13
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.853
Search the outbuildings.

14
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.976
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

15
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.649
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus.

16
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.900
Stay with me.

17
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.934
Give me the torch.

18
00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.780
They're turning!

19
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.408
They're turning!

20
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:05.052
- Retreat to the woods.
- I will stay and fight. You need my help.

21
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.129
I need you alive.

22
00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.464
If you die, we all die.

23
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.798
Now, go.

24
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.222
- Go!
- Hyah.

25
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.452
- We found him.
- And?

26
00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.164
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

27
00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.470
Amelia, we found William.

28
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.578
Surround him!

29
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.166
Take him down.

30
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.175
No.

31
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.105
Leave him be.

32
00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.109
Stop this. You're killing him.

33
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.651
More!

34
00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.224
William.

35
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.008
Marcus!

36
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.390
He was not to be harmed.

37
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:24.066
Place him in my charge as we agreed,
or you will pay for your deceit.

38
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.689
And you will learn your place.

39
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.272
Your sympathy for this beast is foolish.

40
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.200
Your brother is entirely beyond control.

41
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.822
It will be done my way.

42
00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:38.122
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

43
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.035
or William.

44
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:43.585
If you so much as speak his name again,

45
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.130
you will have chosen that future for him.

46
00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:58.642
What is thy will... my lord?

47
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.813
Imprisonment for all time.

48
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.770
Far from you.

49
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:20.323
For six centuries,
I was a loyal soldier of the Vampire clan.

50
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.076
But I was betrayed.

51
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.163
The war was not as it had seemed.

52
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:34.136
In one night, the lies
that had united our kind had been exposed.

53
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.218
Kraven, our second-in-command,

54
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.845
had formed a secret alliance with Lucian,

55
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.973
ruler of the Werewolf clan,

56
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.680
to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

57
00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:49.185
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

58
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.697
Viktor was not the savior
I had been led to believe.

59
00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.282
He had betrayed us all.

60
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.791
Soon the hunt will be on
for his killer.

61
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.135
I have but one ally left:

62
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.136
Michael,

63
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.385
the human descendant of Corvinus.

64
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:24.723
Neither Vampire nor
Lycan, but a hybrid.

65
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.942
It's only a matter of time
before we're found.

66
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.753
My only hope now
is to awaken Marcus,

67
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.712
our last remaining elder,

68
00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.181
and expose the truth

69
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.931
before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

70
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.144
Kraven knows he's no match for him awake.

71
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:49.892
Perfect.

72
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.348
This thing's been dead for weeks.

73
00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.389
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

74
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.517
They do. This one's been given a serum
to stop regression

75
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.723
so it can be studied.

76
00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:34.443
How can you tell?

77
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:44.197
An. Not quite your department, I guess.

78
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.402
I just killed them.

79
00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.783
I didn't pay much attention
to their anatomy.

80
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.120
- How long can we stay here?
- Not long.

81
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.703
These safe houses are all linked together
on one mainframe

82
00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.128
with motion sensors
revealing which ones are active.

83
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.753
Someone could have picked us up already.

84
00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.308
There's only about an hour till daylight.

85
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.887
Can you even make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

86
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.814
- Just.
- Okay, let's get what we need and go.

87
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.016
No.

88
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.440
I'm going alone.

89
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:40.628
Open it.

90
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:27.772
Marcus?

91
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.031
The blood memories
of this wretched creature...

92
00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:39.081
have shown me
that your treachery knows no bounds.

93
00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.913
My lord, I can explain.

94
00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.749
Why would I listen to your lies

95
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.093
when the journey to the truth...

96
00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.226
is so much sweeter?

97
00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.777
I kept his secrets,
cleaned up the mess.

98
00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.658
You'll go before Viktor
and tell him exactly what I tell you to!

99
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.411
You just concentrate on your part.

100
00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.048
Please.

101
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.463
I can assist you.

102
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.546
Oh, you already have.

103
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:40.895
If I can plead my case,

104
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.189
there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

105
00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.876
Right now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

106
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.902
So, what am I supposed to do,
sit and wait?

107
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.669
No, Kraven may still have his men
with him.

108
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
You're not going alone.

109
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.774
You're not as strong as you might think.

110
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.657
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

111
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.908
There's never been a hybrid before.

112
00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.706
However ambivalent
you might feel about it,

113
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.749
the truth is
your powers could be limitless.

114
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.828
But you depend on blood. You need to feed.

115
00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.297
Without it, you'll grow weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

116
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.588
Jesus Christ.

117
00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:13.344
And what if I don't?

118
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.425
What if I can't?

119
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.807
Normal food could be lethal.

120
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.977
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

121
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.646
And believe me,
you don't want that on your conscience.

122
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.725
There really is no going back, Michael.

123
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.611
I'm sorry.

124
00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.323
Look, I understand what you did.

125
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.153
I'm grateful.

126
00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.152
You saved my life.

127
00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.663
I wasn't ready to die.

128
00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:46.331
I don't know.

129
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.588
Everything's changed.

130
00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.535
I probably need just a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

131
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.301
It's a lot to process all at once.

132
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.678
Look, go. I'll be here.

133
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.017
You just make sure you come back.

134
00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.304
Sir.

135
00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:30.390
The innocent who witnessed...

136
00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.438
they've been silenced?

137
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.152
But otherwise unharmed, as ordered.

138
00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.951
- Show me what you have.
- Yes, Sir.

139
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.998
Two Death Dealers were Killed.
We found no Lycan bodies.

140
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.500
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition,

141
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.002
some sort of UV round.

142
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.094
Amelia?

143
00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.221
No one survived.

144
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.595
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present,

145
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.722
but they did nothing to prevent it.

146
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.178
And Viktor?

147
00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.290
And no trace of Marcus amongst the ashes?

148
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:36.043
It seems he destroyed his own coven, sir.

149
00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:39.425
It was never his coven.

150
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.572
We need to go.

151
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.405
Give me a moment.

152
00:23:09.847 --> 00:23:11.303
There you are.

153
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:15.026
How you doing?

154
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:37.882
Thank you.

155
00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.122
Michael Corvin...

156
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.790
Michael Corvin.

157
00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:02.641
You've got to get away from me.

158
00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:05.469
Get away from me!

159
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.576
Hello?

160
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:26.706
- Michael Corvin.
- There.

161
00:26:29.129 --> 00:26:30.164
Michael Corvin.

162
00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.666
Get the men up there. Now.

163
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:43.720
Get the fuck away from me.

164
00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:11.838
Stop! Stop!

165
00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:18.709
Shit.

166
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.348
Michael. Oh, shit.

167
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.392
- Here. Take it.
- No.

168
00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.227
Michael, you'll die.

169
00:29:25.264 --> 00:29:26.345
Shit.

170
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:28.343
Can you move?

171
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.641
We need to go.

172
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:56.826
Marcus.

173
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.503
I know what you've done, Selene.

174
00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:02.874
Viktor deserved his fate,
and Kraven was no better.

175
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:07.963
Kraven has already reaped the rewards
of his own misdeeds.

176
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.971
And Viktor...

177
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:14.431
Viktor deserved his
fate many times over.

178
00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:17.812
A terrible business,

179
00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:20.103
the slaying of your family.

180
00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:23.315
Yet so much effort was spent

181
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.772
to conceal this matter from me.

182
00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:30.367
What do you suppose Viktor had to hide?

183
00:30:31.872 --> 00:30:34.739
Or perhaps it is you, Selene...

184
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:41.086
as the last of your wretched family,

185
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.960
who has something to hide.

186
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.560
Go!

187
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.012
Get in.

188
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:43.330
Dead or alive,
you will give me what I want.

189
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:57.616
You okay?

190
00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:04.205
- He's a hybrid, isn't he?
- Yes.

191
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.667
He wanted this. Why?

192
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880
I don't know.

193
00:34:10.757 --> 00:34:12.293
But we have another problem.

194
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.262
Turn off up here.

195
00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:27.054
Shit. All right, get down.

196
00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.148
Keep your foot on the gas, but stay down.

197
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:47.199
Hold on.

198
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:03.385
Stay down.

199
00:35:58.698 --> 00:35:59.698
Come on.

200
00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:18.791
Give me your hand.

201
00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:20.963
Jesus Christ.

202
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:23.754
There's really no need.

203
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:25.718
I'll be right back.

204
00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.149
All right, let me see.

205
00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:51.873
See? No need.

206
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:42.479
Area secure, sir.

207
00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:11.025
Sun's setting.

208
00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:14.031
What's wrong?

209
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:24.080
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

210
00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:26.249
The tavern events occurred
just before dawn,

211
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:27.871
so they couldn't have got very far.

212
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.876
Remain airborne for the moment.
I'm sure they'll reappear in good time.

213
00:42:31.966 --> 00:42:32.966
Yes, sir.

214
00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:39.963
I've seen this before, when I was a child.

215
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.261
I've held it.

216
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:43.967
When it was open, like this.

217
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:45.393
How is that possible?

218
00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:48.732
I don't know.

219
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:53.309
But I know someone that might.

220
00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:55.687
Andreas Tanis.

221
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:58.649
He was the official historian
of the covens.

222
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:05.530
He fell from favor after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

223
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.333
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

224
00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.750
What happened to him?

225
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:12.044
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

226
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.247
Three hundred years?

227
00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:16.142
What makes you think
we're gonna find him now?

228
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:17.959
I was the one who exiled him.

229
00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:59.217
Looks like a monastery.

230
00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.340
It used to be. More like a prison now.

231
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:04.468
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

232
00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:07.176
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

233
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.197
- That's odd.
- What?

234
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:24.025
I don't remember
this gate being here before.

235
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:27.366
Take this.

236
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:45.464
♪ <i>You were way out of line</i> ♪

237
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:50.097

245
00:45:58.714 --> 00:46:00.079
Go back!

246
00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:02.634
Gotcha.

247
00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.258
Fuck.

248
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:42.913
I knew it was you, Selene.

249
00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:47.422
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

250
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.508
Tanis.

251
00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:50.959
I see your aim hasn't improved.

252
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:54.550
You haven't changed.

253
00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.348
You don't scare me, Selene.

254
00:48:58.477 --> 00:49:00.218
Well, we're gonna have to work on that.

255
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:11.734
We need to talk.

256
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.490
Your exile seems a bit more comfortable
than I remember.

257
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:21.284
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

258
00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:22.917
A gift.

259
00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:24.709
From a most persuasive client.

260
00:49:25.838 --> 00:49:26.838
Lucian.

261
00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:30.540
Why would Lucian wanna protect you?

262
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.751
Because he was trading with them.

263
00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:37.179
UV rounds.

264
00:49:38.017 --> 00:49:40.759
How long have you been in the business
of killing your own kind?

265
00:49:40.853 --> 00:49:43.220
I've done what's necessary to survive.

266
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:48.642
My decision was made easy
the day your precious Viktor betrayed me.

267
00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:50.977
Betrayal was something he did very well.

268
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.652
Viktor's dead. I killed him.

269
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:56.824
You?

270
00:49:57.536 --> 00:49:58.571
Kill Viktor?

271
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:04.706
No, I think not.

272
00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:09.371
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

273
00:50:12.885 --> 00:50:13.885
Ah.

274
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.631
So your eyes are finally open.

275
00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:19.839
Isn't it interesting how the truth

276
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:22.600
is even harder to absorb than light?

277
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.310
You know, I tried to stop him, of course.

278
00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:27.980
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

279
00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:30.983
And then turning you.

280
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.102
That was too much to take.

281
00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:35.984
My protests are why he put me here.

282
00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:39.108
Careful with that, dear.

283
00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:40.948
Makes a terrible bang.

284
00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:43.822
Open the blades and they're active.

285
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:45.828
Good to know.

286
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.338
Viktor put you here for a reason,

287
00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:54.836
but I doubt it was
because you had moral qualms.

288
00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:59.758
- What do you know?
- Very little of anything, I'm afraid.

289
00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:04.769
Oh.

290
00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:08.847
Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

291
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:12.767
Marcus was after this. Why?

292
00:51:57.615 --> 00:51:59.697
Some history is based on truth...

293
00:52:00.701 --> 00:52:02.317
and others on deception.

294
00:52:04.371 --> 00:52:07.614
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

295
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.160
He was once human...

296
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:12.035
the ruler of these lands.

297
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:15.131
Marcus...

298
00:52:16.592 --> 00:52:17.673
he's the one.

299
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.460
The source.

300
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.714
The first true Vampire.

301
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:26.970
So the legend is true.

302
00:52:28.354 --> 00:52:31.437
Toward the end of his ruthless life,

303
00:52:32.566 --> 00:52:36.981
when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold,

304
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.438
Marcus came with an offer,

305
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.199
a reprieve from sickness and death:

306
00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:45.703
immortality.

307
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:49.997
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

308
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:52.241
To do what?

309
00:52:52.753 --> 00:52:55.211
To defeat the very first Werewolves,

310
00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:57.629
a dangerous and infectious breed

311
00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:00.966
created by Marcus' own flesh and blood...

312
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.762
his twin brother, William.

313
00:53:06.892 --> 00:53:08.382
But these weren't the Lycans we know.

314
00:53:08.477 --> 00:53:10.969
Disgusting though your brethren may be,

315
00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:13.179
they at least are evolved.

316
00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:15.264
No, these were raging monsters,

317
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:18.142
never able to take human form again.

318
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:22.564
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

319
00:53:22.658 --> 00:53:26.367
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

320
00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:29.116
He had to be stopped.

321
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:31.743
And so once Viktor's army was turned,

322
00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:37.079
the legions of Vampires under his control
tracked down and destroyed the animals,

323
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.209
then captured William

324
00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:41.298
and locked him away,

325
00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:44.009
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

326
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:47.888
Why let him live?

327
00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:52.390
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: fear.

328
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.392
He was warned that,
should Marcus ever be killed,

329
00:53:55.482 --> 00:53:58.315
all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

330
00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:01.027
So in Viktor's mind,

331
00:54:01.572 --> 00:54:04.234
William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans,

332
00:54:04.324 --> 00:54:05.530
his slaves.

333
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:08.661
Yes.

334
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.783
Yes, a clever deception,

335
00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:15.325
but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

336
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:20.372
And so Marcus was
protected at all costs.

337
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.585
Ah, yes, here we are.

338
00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:33.851
- Vampires?
- Mortals.

339
00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:37.395
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

340
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.191
The father of us all.

341
00:54:49.369 --> 00:54:50.575
What's this?

342
00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:55.539
You should know.

343
00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:59.001
It's William's prison.

344
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.207
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

345
00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:13.717
So you've been the one keeping a watch
over this for me, have you?

346
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:16.473
I've been searching everywhere for this,
my darling.

347
00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:22.316
What is it?

348
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:24.278
What's wrong?

349
00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:28.277
She now understands
why her family was killed.

350
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.986
But that was many years later.

351
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:36.448
The winter of Lucian's escape.

352
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:38.456
Your father knew too much.

353
00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:40.997
Or too much for Viktor to risk,

354
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:43.249
especially when Lucian...

355
00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:46.750
had the key to William's cell.

356
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:49.840
And I am the map.

357
00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:52.431
Yes.

358
00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:57.726
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

359
00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:02.102
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly,

360
00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.526
but Marcus knows that the memory,

361
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:08.650
and therefore the exact location
of William's prison...

362
00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.694
is hidden away in your blood.

363
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.077
Why is Marcus looking for him now,

364
00:56:15.664 --> 00:56:17.154
after all this time?

365
00:56:17.749 --> 00:56:18.784
That I cannot answer.

366
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:32.629
But I do know someone who could stop him.

367
00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:34.134
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

368
00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:40.595
In exchange for your discretion,
of course.

369
00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:42.934
Of course.

370
00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:41.330
Tanis. You seem anxious.

371
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.325
Why do you flee the very sight of me?

372
00:57:49.883 --> 00:57:50.998
Please...

373
00:57:52.177 --> 00:57:53.177
sit.

374
00:57:54.972 --> 00:57:57.304
There's no need for this to be unpleasant.

375
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:01.346
I've always rather enjoyed your company.

376
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:08.978
Now you're being rude.

377
00:58:10.946 --> 00:58:11.946
Sorry.

378
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:22.534
Viktor struck two keys.

379
00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:24.494
What do you know of them?

380
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:27.670
Keys?

381
00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:31.455
I don't know of any keys.

382
00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:48.939
Oh, yes.

383
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:51.232
Yes, those keys.

384
00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:52.862
Yes?

385
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.565
Well, one was...

386
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.906
One was kept in plain sight,

387
00:58:59.077 --> 00:59:00.863
draped around his daughter's neck,

388
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.491
right there for you to see.

389
00:59:03.582 --> 00:59:04.582
And the other?

390
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:09.581
- Kept with Viktor at all times.
- Where?

391
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.329
Within him.

392
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:15.962
Beneath the flesh.

393
00:59:22.434 --> 00:59:24.550
Please. Please.

394
00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:25.679
I beg you. Please.

395
00:59:25.771 --> 00:59:27.387
Please, I beg you.

396
00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:46.868
Who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

397
00:59:46.958 --> 00:59:49.575
Go to Pier 17. Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

398
01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.189
How do we know Tanis isn't setting us up?

399
01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.316
He's not brave enough to set me up.

400
01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:45.972
You can go.

401
01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:58.151
You're familiar with this, then?

402
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.324
Intimately.

403
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.499
You're Alexander Corvinus.

404
01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:25.421
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

405
01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.885
By any name, I am still your forefather.

406
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.351
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

407
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:43.064
For centuries,
I've stood by and watched the havoc

408
01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:48.073
my sons have wrought
upon each other and upon humanity.

409
01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.158
Not the legacy I prayed for

410
01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.581
the morning I watched them
enter this world.

411
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.161
And a tiresome duty

412
01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.418
keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess,

413
01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.752
hiding my family's unfortunate history.

414
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.258
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

415
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.636
Could you kill your own sons?

416
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.968
You know what Marcus will do.

417
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.888
If he finds me, he finds William's prison.

418
01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.724
You need to help us stop him.

419
01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:23.529
You are asking me to help you kill my son?

420
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.280
You?

421
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.156
A Death Dealer?

422
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.360
How many innocents did you Kill

423
01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.287
in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

424
01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:35.036
Spare me your self-righteous declarations.

425
01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:39.370
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

426
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.336
At least he cannot control his savagery.

427
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.963
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

428
01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.012
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability

429
01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:53.639
to accept that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

430
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.435
You could've stopped all of this.

431
01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.138
Do not come groveling to me

432
01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:00.941
simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

433
01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.145
You know the devastation William caused
before he was captured.

434
01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:05.525
He cannot be set free.

435
01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:56.913
Wa... No, wait. You're no match for him.

436
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.020
Soon, brother.

437
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
No!

438
01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.316
Father.

439
01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.322
No.

440
01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.200
They've gone. There, there, my child.

441
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.869
You are safe now.

442
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.833
No. Michael.

443
01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:11.047
Look at me.

444
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:14.386
Michael.

445
01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.633
Shit.

446
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.700
Please.

447
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:47.417
Please.

448
01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:57.881
Come on.

449
01:06:58.932 --> 01:06:59.932
Come on.

450
01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.514
Fuck.

451
01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:53.809
Hello, Father.

452
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:57.445
You are unwelcome in my presence.

453
01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.491
Ah.

454
01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.444
The predictable heart that never thaws.

455
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.243
Pity it beats within such a fool.

456
01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.875
The eldest of the immortals,

457
01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.501
yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

458
01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:20.382
We are oddities of nature, you and ll.
Nothing more.

459
01:08:21.222 --> 01:08:23.589
This is a world for humanity.

460
01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.517
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

461
01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:30.729
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium

462
01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:33.557
as William suffered alone in darkness?

463
01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.028
No, Father.

464
01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.359
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

465
01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:45.785
Viktor's key. Where is it?

466
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.534
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

467
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.583
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

468
01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.454
And our bond is greater
than you have ever wanted to acknowledge.

469
01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.663
You're wrong.

470
01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.509
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

471
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.085
Oh, not Lycans, Father,

472
01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:04.008
or Vampires.

473
01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:08.801
A new race,
created in the image of their maker...

474
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.936
their new god:

475
01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:15.859
me.

476
01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:30.614
And a true god...

477
01:09:36.047 --> 01:09:37.629
has no father.

478
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.621
You will fail.

479
01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.200
- Get the Kit.
- No.

480
01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:03.085
Please, sir, let us help you.

481
01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:06.335
The time has come, my friend.

482
01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.466
Find the girl.

483
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.298
Bring her to me.

484
01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.813
No, wait. Wait.

485
01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.564
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

486
01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.362
Don't leave him here.

487
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.852
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

488
01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.141
He's too powerful for you alone.

489
01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.939
You are the only one older than he is,

490
01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.690
the only one stronger.

491
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.072
You could have killed him yourself.

492
01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.901
No matter what he's become...

493
01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.537
he is my son.

494
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.837
You are the last hope left.

495
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.259
There is only one way to defeat him.

496
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.431
Quickly, now,

497
01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.431
before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

498
01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:53.316
What will I become?

499
01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:57.112
The future.

500
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.284
Go now.

501
01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:30.728
We're getting close.

502
01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:28.701
Head back around towards the river.

503
01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.840
I don't see a way inside.

504
01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.341
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

505
01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.013
It must be submerged now.

506
01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.257
Looks like we're getting wet.

507
01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:28.805
Closer.

508
01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:35.768
Selene.

509
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:50.876
William.

510
01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.185
Wait.

511
01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:14.442
No, William. Stop.

512
01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.527
Be still, brother.

513
01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.204
It's me.

514
01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.539
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

515
01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.243
Which way?

516
01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.351
Is this it?

517
01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:33.646
He's already here.

518
01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.314
What is that?

519
01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:12.685
Nothing. Let's go.

520
01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:25.493
We're too late.

521
01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.569
- After him.
- Get behind him.

522
01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:06.613
Impressive.

523
01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.234
Michael, you're unique.

524
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.567
There's never been a hybrid before.

525
01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.075
Your powers could be limitless.

526
01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:44.754
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

527
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.268
- Where is he?
- He went right through there.

528
01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:55.898
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

529
01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.975
No, but they'll slow him down.

530
01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:45.989
Let's go.

531
01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:47.743
You all right?

532
01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:05.863
Jesus Christ!

533
01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.635
But these weren't the Lycans we know.
No, these were raging monsters.

534
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.188
Unable to take human form ever again.

535
01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.649
What are you waiting for? Shoot them.

536
01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:59.360
I can't. Not without taking her out.

537
01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.740
I can't get a shot.

538
01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:53.755
Michael.

539
01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:31.167
Take her down.

540
01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:07.696
Cut us loose!

541
01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:10.828
We're going down!

542
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.887
William!

543
01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:06.027
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

544
01:35:07.076 --> 01:35:10.319
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

545
01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:01.157
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

546
01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:05.498
The lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred.
