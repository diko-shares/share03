1
00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:03.247
Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.

2
00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:05.583
Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.

3
00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:06.917
Both barrels.

4
00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:10.137
A crime of passion.

5
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.673
Yeah.

6
00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.925
Just look at all the passion on that wall.

7
00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:17.612
Yeah, well, this is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

8
00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:23.642
The kid see it?

9
00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:24.827
What?

10
00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:27.062
The kid.

11
00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:28.939
What kind of fucking question is that?

12
00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:34.570
We are all gonna be real glad when we get
rid of you, Somerset, you know that?

13
00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:37.581
There's always these questions with you.
Did the kid see it?

14
00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:40.492
Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.954
Anything else has nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.564
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.992
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.678
Lieutenant, I apologize for interrupting like this...

19
00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:02.473
just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.658
Look...

21
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.601
Mills?

22
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:08.479
I thought we might find a bar someplace.
You know, sit, talk...

23
00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.522
I'd like to get to the precinct.

24
00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.276
You know, not much time
for this transition thing.

25
00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:17.696
I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.

26
00:02:17.863 --> 00:02:18.873
Yeah.

27
00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:21.625
Why here?

28
00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:23.461
I don't follow.

29
00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.572
Well, all this effort to get transferred.

30
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.393
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

31
00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:32.836
I guess for the same reasons as you.

32
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.815
Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?

33
00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:39.802
You just met me.

34
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.314
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

35
00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:46.008
It's very simple.

36
00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.254
You actually fought to get reassigned here.

37
00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:53.564
I've just never seen it
done that way before.

38
00:02:53.565 --> 00:02:54.986
I thought I could do some good, look,

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.862
it would be great for me if we didn't start
out kicking each other in the balls.

40
00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.334
If you're calling the shots, lieutenant...
Yes.

41
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.214
I want you to look
and I want you to listen, Ok?

42
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.041
Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.

43
00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:13.294
I've worked Homicide five years.
Not here.

44
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.503
I understand that.

45
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.916
Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

46
00:07:03.482 --> 00:07:05.484
Hello? Yeah.

47
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.669
Ok.

48
00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:09.388
Say it again.

49
00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:15.786
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

50
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.118
Serpico's gotta go.

51
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:27.464
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.

52
00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:29.258
This eye, Serpico.

53
00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:30.884
Did you get it?
Got it.

54
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.086
Good.

55
00:07:48.777 --> 00:07:50.112
Coffee?
No?

56
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:57.461
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

57
00:07:57.828 --> 00:07:59.496
What time was death established?

58
00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:00.864
Like I said...

59
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:02.666
I didn't touch anything.

60
00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.837
But he's had his face in a plate of
spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.

61
00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.556
Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?

62
00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.091
Did I stutter?

63
00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:14.636
This guy ain't breathing unless he
started breathing spaghetti sauce.

64
00:08:14.803 --> 00:08:16.587
So that's how it's done around here?

65
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:18.136
I beg your pardon, detective.

66
00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:21.184
But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.

67
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:23.520
If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.

68
00:08:23.687 --> 00:08:25.556
All right, thank you, officer.
Ok.

69
00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:27.458
Thank you.

70
00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.752
I wonder.

71
00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:44.867
What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?

72
00:08:45.334 --> 00:08:46.376
Don't know.

73
00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:49.964
How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?

74
00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:53.308
Drop it.

75
00:09:23.372 --> 00:09:27.059
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

76
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.628
Better Homes and Gardens.

77
00:09:56.822 --> 00:09:58.381
Who said this was murder?

78
00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.125
No one.

79
00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:05.222
Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.

80
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:10.211
If this isn't a coronary,

81
00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:13.302
well, I don't know...

82
00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:41.050
How about that?

83
00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.086
We had this case once.

84
00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:55.931
Guy dead on the ground.

85
00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:57.466
Knife in his back.

86
00:10:57.632 --> 00:10:59.076
Gotta be murder, right?

87
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.512
Fuck.

88
00:11:03.346 --> 00:11:05.891
Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah?

89
00:11:06.057 --> 00:11:10.771
So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

90
00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.608
And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.

91
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.393
Could you please be quiet?

92
00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:27.245
Wait a minute.

93
00:11:27.579 --> 00:11:28.589
What?

94
00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:33.035
Got a bucket here.

95
00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:35.045
What's in it?

96
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:41.810
Oh, God.

97
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:43.804
Fucking vomit.

98
00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:47.390
Any blood in it?

99
00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:50.302
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

100
00:11:55.732 --> 00:11:57.634
Are you thinking it's poison?

101
00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:01.279
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

102
00:12:01.446 --> 00:12:03.073
Thinking it's poison, Somerset?

103
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.201
You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.

104
00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:08.529
Don't know if we'll all fit, though.

105
00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:10.403
There's room, light's the problem.

106
00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:12.549
Hi, how are you?
Hey.

107
00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:16.612
Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?

108
00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:20.523
What?

109
00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:22.838
Send in Forensics on your way out, please.

110
00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:39.668
He's dead.

111
00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:43.013
Thank you, doctor.

112
00:12:48.743 --> 00:12:51.489
You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.

113
00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:53.515
Nope.

114
00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:58.919
I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.

115
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.656
I did that shit for a long time.

116
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.133
And?

117
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.636
Badge on my belt says detective.
That's the same as yours.

118
00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:10.215
Look, I made a decision.

119
00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:13.418
I had to consider the integrity of the scene.

120
00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:17.397
Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.

121
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.840
Hey, man...

122
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:23.695
just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

123
00:13:30.368 --> 00:13:32.037
He's been dead a long time.

124
00:13:32.203 --> 00:13:34.247
And I can tell you, it was not from poison.

125
00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.582
Oh, man.

126
00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:37.918
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

127
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.671
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

128
00:13:44.507 --> 00:13:46.885
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

129
00:13:47.052 --> 00:13:49.054
Please.
It's obvious he was a shut-in.

130
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.639
Now, look at this.

131
00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:52.349
See how big this stomach is?

132
00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:55.352
And the strange thing is, it stretches.

133
00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:58.896
Here. Look at the size of
the cardiac orifice, where the food...

134
00:13:58.897 --> 00:14:01.983
Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.

135
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.612
Ok. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.

136
00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:08.698
And the interior wall is ripped open.

137
00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:11.368
This man ate till he burst?

138
00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.037
He didn't really burst.
Not all the way.

139
00:14:14.204 --> 00:14:16.665
He was hemorrhaging internally.

140
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:21.044
And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.

141
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:22.545
So he did die by eating.

142
00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:24.155
Yes and no.

143
00:14:26.257 --> 00:14:27.968
What about these bruises up here?

144
00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:31.638
Well, I haven't figured that out yet.

145
00:14:32.013 --> 00:14:33.682
Gun pressed against his head?

146
00:14:33.848 --> 00:14:35.183
Pressed hard enough, sure.

147
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.810
Fuck, yeah.

148
00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.896
Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.

149
00:14:41.773 --> 00:14:45.285
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

150
00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:50.907
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving.

151
00:14:51.074 --> 00:14:52.450
Took his time, too.

152
00:14:52.617 --> 00:14:55.370
Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.

153
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.832
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.

154
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.876
And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

155
00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:04.587
That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.

156
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:07.180
Sadistic fucker.

157
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:09.421
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot him.

158
00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:12.012
You don't risk the time it takes to do this.

159
00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:15.473
Unless the act itself has meaning.
Come on.

160
00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:19.436
Somebody had a problem with the fat
boy and decided to torture him.

161
00:15:19.602 --> 00:15:20.603
Simple as that.

162
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.872
In the grocery bags, we found two receipts.

163
00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:25.275
That means the killer stopped
in the middle of everything,

164
00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:27.569
and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

165
00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:29.012
So?

166
00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.450
Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

167
00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:34.993
This is beginning.

168
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.654
We've got one dead guy, not three.

169
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:39.264
No motive.

170
00:15:39.998 --> 00:15:43.626
Don't even start that big brain of
yours cooking on this, all right?

171
00:15:43.793 --> 00:15:46.529
Please, I'd like to be reassigned.

172
00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:47.996
What?
What?

173
00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:48.746
What?

174
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.080
What in the hell are you talking about?

175
00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:53.511
This can't be my last duty.

176
00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:55.638
It's just gonna go on and on and on.

177
00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:56.848
You're retiring.

178
00:15:57.015 --> 00:15:59.184
Six more days and you're all the way gone.

179
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.561
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished...

180
00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:05.273
Those other oases were taken as close
to conclusion as humanly possible.

181
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.816
And if I may speak freely?

182
00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.318
We're all friends here.

183
00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:12.154
This should not be his first assignment.
Oh, come on, I knew it.

184
00:16:12.155 --> 00:16:14.382
This is not my first assignment,
you dick.

185
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:15.633
It's too soon for him.

186
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.660
Hey man, you know I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.

187
00:16:18.661 --> 00:16:20.330
Captain...
It's too soon for you.

188
00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:23.933
Captain, if we can just talk in private?

189
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.044
This isn't working.
It's a personal thing.

190
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.754
Maybe...
Just shut up, Mills.

191
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:31.841
Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.

192
00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:34.803
This is Metro.
You don't just get to swap.

193
00:16:34.969 --> 00:16:36.296
Give it to me.

194
00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:37.378
Say what?

195
00:16:37.392 --> 00:16:39.223
Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.

196
00:16:39.224 --> 00:16:41.351
Sorry, but see you later.
Have a nice time.

197
00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:44.187
Give it to me.
No, I'm putting you on something else.

198
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:48.233
Go on, Mills.

199
00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.884
Just go on.

200
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.950
I'm sorry, old buddy.

201
00:16:57.117 --> 00:17:00.320
But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

202
00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:19.597
All right, here we go. Quiet down.

203
00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:23.518
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

204
00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:25.395
Quiet down.

205
00:17:25.854 --> 00:17:27.939
Calm down. Quiet down.

206
00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:30.942
Now, here's how it's gonna work.

207
00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:34.729
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

208
00:17:35.196 --> 00:17:38.533
If those questions do not come in
a calm, sane and orderly fashion...

209
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.909
I'm on my way out here.

210
00:17:40.118 --> 00:17:41.911
Detective?
Detective?

211
00:17:42.078 --> 00:17:43.755
Can I have a moment of your time?
No.

212
00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:52.297
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation

213
00:17:52.463 --> 00:17:54.048
so don't even bother asking.

214
00:18:13.443 --> 00:18:16.362
What you guys got for me?
Nothing yet, boss.

215
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:22.694
Why don't you guys, go get a coffee.

216
00:18:24.454 --> 00:18:26.456
<i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>

217
00:18:26.623 --> 00:18:28.499
<i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>

218
00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:31.961
<i>where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.</i>

219
00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:35.798
<i>District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.</i>

220
00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:39.944
<i>There could be a conflict of interest?</i>

221
00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:42.337
<i>That is ridiculous to the point
of being offensive.</i>

222
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.306
<i>There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>

223
00:18:44.307 --> 00:18:47.410
<i>And any claim that there
could be is irresponsible.</i>

224
00:18:47.411 --> 00:18:48.415
<i>Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>

225
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:49.405
<i>Now hold on.</i>

226
00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:51.338
<i>It's rumored you're far
from apprehending a suspect?</i>

227
00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:52.151
<i>Let me address that.</i>

228
00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:56.227
<i>I've just come from a meeting of law
enforcement officials and they've assured me,</i>

229
00:18:56.986 --> 00:18:59.806
<i>they have their very best men on this.</i>

230
00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:05.245
<i>This will be the very definition
of swift justice.</i>

231
00:19:29.143 --> 00:19:30.853
Pardon me, George.

232
00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:37.419
Somerset.
Come in.

233
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.531
Have you heard the news?
Nope, haven't heard.

234
00:19:41.698 --> 00:19:44.492
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

235
00:19:44.659 --> 00:19:48.113
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

236
00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:51.241
Wrote the word greed on the floor.

237
00:19:57.046 --> 00:19:59.632
Greed?
Yeah, in blood.

238
00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:02.176
Mills is heading up the investigation.

239
00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:04.637
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

240
00:20:06.055 --> 00:20:07.724
Could you not do that, please?

241
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.267
Oh, Ok.

242
00:20:10.393 --> 00:20:11.928
Well, good for him.

243
00:20:12.395 --> 00:20:15.732
What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?

244
00:20:15.898 --> 00:20:17.859
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.

245
00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:19.235
Fix my house.

246
00:20:19.402 --> 00:20:20.870
Don't you feel it?

247
00:20:21.237 --> 00:20:23.406
Don't you feel that feeling?

248
00:20:23.573 --> 00:20:26.234
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.

249
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:28.345
That's the whole idea.

250
00:20:30.246 --> 00:20:32.040
I don't think you're leaving.

251
00:20:32.206 --> 00:20:34.151
Hell, you can't leave all this.

252
00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.671
Guy's out walking his dog.

253
00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:40.248
Gets attacked.

254
00:20:40.715 --> 00:20:43.126
His watch is taken, his wallet.

255
00:20:43.593 --> 00:20:46.413
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless...

256
00:20:47.263 --> 00:20:50.275
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

257
00:20:51.726 --> 00:20:54.395
This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.

258
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.940
Yeah, I read about it.

259
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.645
I don't understand this place any longer.

260
00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.448
It's the way it's always been.

261
00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:02.612
Maybe you're right.

262
00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:04.113
You do this work.

263
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.550
You were made for it and I
don't think you can deny that.

264
00:21:08.785 --> 00:21:10.261
Maybe I'm wrong.

265
00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:14.649
The coroner sent this down for you.

266
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:19.462
Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.

267
00:21:19.629 --> 00:21:23.549
Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
Set them on the desk, please.

268
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.247
They were...

269
00:21:29.514 --> 00:21:30.856
They were fed to him.

270
00:23:10.573 --> 00:23:11.866
Oh, Lord.

271
00:23:19.624 --> 00:23:22.084
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator,

272
00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:23.820
in the obesity murder scene.

273
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:30.218
Long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light.

274
00:23:30.384 --> 00:23:31.820
It's from Milton.

275
00:23:32.428 --> 00:23:33.905
Paradise Lost.

276
00:23:34.597 --> 00:23:36.516
All right, I'm confused.

277
00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:39.319
It means that this is beginning.

278
00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:42.688
This was found behind the same refrigerator.

279
00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:44.982
Written in grease.

280
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:47.460
There are seven deadly sins, captain.

281
00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:49.395
Gluttony.

282
00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:53.416
Greed.

283
00:23:55.284 --> 00:23:59.080
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...

284
00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:01.558
and envy.

285
00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:03.635
Seven.
Hold on.

286
00:24:04.627 --> 00:24:06.712
This is not even my desk.

287
00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:09.882
You can expect five more of these.

288
00:24:11.676 --> 00:24:12.718
Now, wait a minute.

289
00:24:14.303 --> 00:24:16.589
I can't get involved in this.

290
00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:20.184
Somerset.

291
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:21.961
He wanted it.

292
00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:25.857
Damn.
I'm all over it.

293
00:25:00.182 --> 00:25:01.767
Where you headed?

294
00:25:04.687 --> 00:25:06.689
Far away from here.

295
00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:18.092
Thanks, George.
How you doing?

296
00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:20.286
Just a few things to look up.

297
00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:22.371
Ok. Sit where you'd like.

298
00:25:23.706 --> 00:25:24.915
How's everybody?

299
00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:27.810
Hi, Smiley.

300
00:25:28.586 --> 00:25:30.880
Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.

301
00:25:31.047 --> 00:25:32.381
Duty calls.

302
00:25:48.481 --> 00:25:50.166
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

303
00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:52.409
I'll never understand.

304
00:25:53.736 --> 00:25:55.237
All these books,

305
00:25:55.404 --> 00:25:57.740
a world of knowledge at your fingertips.

306
00:25:57.907 --> 00:25:59.392
What do you do?

307
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:01.410
You play poker all night.

308
00:26:01.911 --> 00:26:03.746
Hey, we got culture.

309
00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:05.915
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

310
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.919
All right.

311
00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:11.729
How's this for culture?

312
00:28:49.787 --> 00:28:51.580
You know, Smiley...

313
00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:53.750
you're really gonna miss us.

314
00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:57.403
I just might.

315
00:29:54.977 --> 00:29:56.779
Fucking Dante.

316
00:29:57.146 --> 00:30:01.225
Goddamn poetry-writing,
faggot piece of shit.

317
00:30:01.692 --> 00:30:02.877
Fucker.

318
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.194
Yeah?

319
00:30:14.038 --> 00:30:15.840
Good work, officer.

320
00:30:22.838 --> 00:30:25.007
Thank you, Lord.

321
00:30:32.181 --> 00:30:34.133
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:37.386
Be out of your way in a second.

323
00:30:49.782 --> 00:30:51.951
You want your chair?
No. You go ahead.

324
00:30:52.117 --> 00:30:53.135
Yeah?

325
00:31:32.116 --> 00:31:33.175
Phone.

326
00:31:34.076 --> 00:31:35.202
It's a package deal.

327
00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:36.412
Comes with the office.

328
00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:43.085
Mills.
<i>Honey.</i>

329
00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:46.839
Are you Ok, something wrong?
<i>No.</i>

330
00:31:47.297 --> 00:31:48.516
You dingle berry, I...

331
00:31:48.541 --> 00:31:51.325
told you not to call me
here when I'm working.

332
00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:54.263
Yeah. Why?

333
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.715
Why?

334
00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:59.476
Why?
Come on.

335
00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:04.040
Ok.

336
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.111
It's my wife.

337
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.654
Sorry?

338
00:32:12.114 --> 00:32:13.574
She'd like to speak to you.

339
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.377
This is Detective Somerset.

340
00:32:25.544 --> 00:32:27.463
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>

341
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:30.299
Well, it's nice to talk to you too.

342
00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:34.303
I appreciate the offer, but...

343
00:32:37.014 --> 00:32:40.100
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
<i>Great.</i>

344
00:32:40.267 --> 00:32:43.270
Yes, thank you very much.
<i>Thank you. See you later.</i>

345
00:32:43.437 --> 00:32:44.772
Bye.

346
00:32:47.232 --> 00:32:48.275
Hon, what...

347
00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:57.751
Well?

348
00:32:58.118 --> 00:33:00.096
Sorry?
What?

349
00:33:00.662 --> 00:33:03.207
I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.

350
00:33:03.373 --> 00:33:04.792
I accepted.

351
00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:07.136
At my... How's that?

352
00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:08.988
To night.

353
00:33:15.636 --> 00:33:17.338
Hello, men.

354
00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:19.973
Hi, loser.
Hi, idiot.

355
00:33:21.683 --> 00:33:22.976
This is Tracy.

356
00:33:24.103 --> 00:33:25.730
Somerset.
Hello.

357
00:33:26.396 --> 00:33:29.700
I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

358
00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:32.027
Except, of course, your first name.

359
00:33:33.403 --> 00:33:34.655
It's William.

360
00:33:35.447 --> 00:33:38.518
Well, it's a good name, William.

361
00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:41.537
William, I'd like you to meet David.

362
00:33:41.703 --> 00:33:45.441
David, this is William.
Ok, all right, I'm gonna. I'll be right back.

363
00:33:45.707 --> 00:33:47.835
How are the kids?
Good, they're in the room.

364
00:33:47.848 --> 00:33:49.361
Come on in.

365
00:33:50.754 --> 00:33:52.422
Oh, good dogs.

366
00:33:52.589 --> 00:33:55.467
How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

367
00:33:57.469 --> 00:33:58.821
How are you?

368
00:34:01.014 --> 00:34:02.358
How are you?

369
00:34:06.436 --> 00:34:08.397
Smells good.
What?

370
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:11.975
Yeah.
I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:13.277 --> 00:34:16.822
Please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?

372
00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.448
No. No, thanks.

373
00:34:18.615 --> 00:34:21.284
I'll wait.
Ok, you can just throw that anywhere.

374
00:34:21.285 --> 00:34:25.422
You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.

375
00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:30.085
I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.140
Pretty hokey.

377
00:34:35.632 --> 00:34:37.226
You know something?

378
00:34:37.634 --> 00:34:40.804
I knew on our first date that this
was the guy I was gonna marry.

379
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:42.114
Really?

380
00:34:43.265 --> 00:34:45.818
He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.

381
00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:51.398
Really?

382
00:34:54.693 --> 00:34:57.029
Well, it's kind of rare nowadays, you know.

383
00:34:57.196 --> 00:35:00.749
I mean, that level of commitment.

384
00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:07.047
Oh, don't worry.

385
00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:10.292
I won't wear it to the dinner table.
No.

386
00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:13.962
I... You know, no matter
how often I see guns, I just...

387
00:35:14.129 --> 00:35:16.890
I can't get used to them.

388
00:35:17.925 --> 00:35:19.009
Same here.

389
00:35:29.353 --> 00:35:30.979
Why aren't you married, William?

390
00:35:31.146 --> 00:35:33.315
Oh, Trace, what the hell?

391
00:35:33.482 --> 00:35:35.209
I was close once.

392
00:35:36.276 --> 00:35:37.402
It just didn't happen.

393
00:35:37.819 --> 00:35:39.663
It surprises me.

394
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.632
It really does.

395
00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:44.193
Well...

396
00:35:45.327 --> 00:35:49.657
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

397
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.917
Just ask your husband.

398
00:35:52.084 --> 00:35:53.418
Very true.

399
00:35:53.585 --> 00:35:55.637
Very, very true.

400
00:35:56.171 --> 00:35:58.632
So how long have you lived here?

401
00:35:59.049 --> 00:36:00.092
Too long.

402
00:36:04.304 --> 00:36:05.689
How are you liking it?

403
00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:11.387
You know, takes time, settle in.

404
00:36:12.646 --> 00:36:14.064
It'll be good.

405
00:36:14.231 --> 00:36:16.358
Well, you get numb after awhile.

406
00:36:17.693 --> 00:36:19.194
There are things to any city.

407
00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:27.035
Subway.

408
00:36:27.202 --> 00:36:30.163
It will go away in a minute.
It's nothing.

409
00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:35.002
Real estate guy.

410
00:36:35.168 --> 00:36:36.503
Fucking piece of...

411
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.463
Sorry, honey.
He's...

412
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.966
He shows us the place
a few times.

413
00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:43.010
I think he's good.
He's efficient.

414
00:36:43.176 --> 00:36:45.053
Tracy really likes him.

415
00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.558
Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?

416
00:36:49.725 --> 00:36:51.435
We found out the first night.

417
00:36:51.852 --> 00:36:56.557
The soothing, relaxing, vibrating home.

418
00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:06.908
I'm sorry.

419
00:37:13.623 --> 00:37:15.542
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

420
00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:20.630
I don't know why you're laughing.

421
00:37:24.551 --> 00:37:26.436
All right, already.

422
00:37:30.307 --> 00:37:31.892
The guy would've had to get
into the building

423
00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:34.603
before the office was closed
and security tightened.

424
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.605
Now, Gould would've been working late.

425
00:37:36.772 --> 00:37:39.816
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

426
00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:41.026
Infamous, really.

427
00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:43.403
Now listen, body was found
on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.741
The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday...

429
00:37:47.908 --> 00:37:52.162
laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday...

430
00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:54.573
Sunday, maybe even Monday.

431
00:37:55.248 --> 00:37:56.792
Hey, look at this.

432
00:37:56.958 --> 00:37:59.211
Gould was bound, right arm almost free.

433
00:37:59.378 --> 00:38:00.879
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:02.964 --> 00:38:04.674
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:06.093
A pound of flesh?

436
00:38:06.468 --> 00:38:08.220
Yeah.

437
00:38:13.148 --> 00:38:16.022
One pound of flesh,
no more, no less.

438
00:38:16.147 --> 00:38:19.748
No cartilage, no bone,
but only flesh.

439
00:38:19.773 --> 00:38:21.817
Merchant of Venice.
Didn't see it.

440
00:38:21.983 --> 00:38:25.153
This task done and
he would go free.

441
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.490
I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.

442
00:38:28.657 --> 00:38:30.209
Of course.

443
00:38:30.826 --> 00:38:33.470
The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time...

444
00:38:34.037 --> 00:38:37.541
to sit and decide which out to make first.

445
00:38:37.707 --> 00:38:39.209
Imagine it.

446
00:38:39.376 --> 00:38:41.370
There's a gun in your face.

447
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.756
Which part of your body is expendable?

448
00:38:44.923 --> 00:38:46.758
What about the love handle?

449
00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:49.678
Cut along the side of his own stomach.

450
00:38:50.345 --> 00:38:52.848
All right, let's take a fresh look at these.

451
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:55.308
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

452
00:38:55.475 --> 00:38:57.185
Edit out the initial shock.

453
00:38:57.352 --> 00:39:02.774
Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

454
00:39:02.941 --> 00:39:05.485
until it's an exhausted possibility.

455
00:39:05.652 --> 00:39:07.446
Just gonna get another beer.
Beer?

456
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.023
Wine, please.

457
00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:19.875
He's preaching.

458
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.835
He's punishing.

459
00:39:23.628 --> 00:39:26.565
The sins were used in medieval sermons.

460
00:39:27.382 --> 00:39:30.193
There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins,

461
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.553
used as teaching tools.

462
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.222
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like in,
The Parson's Tale and...

463
00:39:34.389 --> 00:39:35.891
What's this?
Dante.

464
00:39:36.057 --> 00:39:37.568
You read them?
Yeah.

465
00:39:38.235 --> 00:39:39.077
Well, parts.

466
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:41.434
Hey, remember in... Purgatory?

467
00:39:41.688 --> 00:39:44.165
Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill,

468
00:39:44.232 --> 00:39:46.001
they're checking out all the sinners, yeah?

469
00:39:46.568 --> 00:39:49.663
Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
Yeah, yeah, right.

470
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.083
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.

471
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:57.454
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider that
the books were the killer's inspiration.

472
00:39:57.621 --> 00:40:00.782
The sermons were about atonement for sin.

473
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.576
These murders are like forced attrition.

474
00:40:04.085 --> 00:40:06.129
Forced what?
Attrition.

475
00:40:06.296 --> 00:40:09.090
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

476
00:40:09.257 --> 00:40:12.302
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

477
00:40:16.306 --> 00:40:18.683
No fingerprints.
Nope.

478
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.103
Totally unrelated victims.
Yeah.

479
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.731
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:24.898 --> 00:40:26.566
Which I don't get.

481
00:40:26.733 --> 00:40:29.686
Because the fucker had to get back out.

482
00:40:30.487 --> 00:40:34.675
Well, in any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:35.492 --> 00:40:39.120
The first thing they teach women in
rape prevention is never cry for help.

484
00:40:39.955 --> 00:40:41.456
Always yell fire.

485
00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:42.916
Nobody answers to Help.

486
00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:45.001
You holler fire, they come running.

487
00:40:45.418 --> 00:40:46.836
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:47.003 --> 00:40:49.898
He must've left another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:51.967 --> 00:40:53.009
You know what?

490
00:40:53.176 --> 00:40:56.471
Thank you for talking this out,
but I gotta sleep.

491
00:40:56.846 --> 00:41:00.432
Walk the dogs.
This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:41:00.433 --> 00:41:03.144
I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
Oh, shit.

493
00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:04.638
No, wait, wait.

494
00:41:06.189 --> 00:41:08.942
Gould's wife.
She was out of town at the time.

495
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:12.320
So this means she saw something.
What if it's a threat?

496
00:41:12.487 --> 00:41:16.456
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

497
00:41:24.499 --> 00:41:26.960
What if it isn't something she has seen?

498
00:41:27.127 --> 00:41:31.214
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

499
00:41:31.715 --> 00:41:33.091
Yeah, Ok. What?

500
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.018
I don't know.

501
00:41:36.803 --> 00:41:39.097
But that's the one thing.

502
00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:25.569
Sign us in.

503
00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:28.021
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

504
00:42:28.521 --> 00:42:30.523
Treat me like a prisoner.

505
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.860
Why do you have a phone if I can't
make long distance phone calls?

506
00:42:34.027 --> 00:42:35.111
Mrs. Gould?

507
00:42:35.278 --> 00:42:36.696
Don't treat people like this.

508
00:42:41.743 --> 00:42:44.204
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.
I truly am.

509
00:42:44.996 --> 00:42:46.706
I don't understand.

510
00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:51.961
Ok, I need you to look at
each photo very carefully.

511
00:42:52.128 --> 00:42:57.092
Look and see if there's anything
strange or out of place.

512
00:42:57.258 --> 00:42:58.259
Anything at all.

513
00:42:59.302 --> 00:43:01.346
I don't see anything.
You're sure?

514
00:43:01.513 --> 00:43:04.015
Please, I just...
I can't do this right now.

515
00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:05.209
Ok.

516
00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:07.852
It's got to be now.

517
00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:10.313
There may be something we haven't seen.

518
00:43:19.155 --> 00:43:20.573
Wait.

519
00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.992
What?
Here.

520
00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:29.958
This painting, it's upside down.

521
00:43:37.298 --> 00:43:39.342
You sure your men didn't move this?
No, no.

522
00:43:39.509 --> 00:43:42.220
Those shots were taken before forensics.

523
00:43:45.306 --> 00:43:46.766
Nothing.

524
00:43:47.684 --> 00:43:50.311
There's gotta be something.

525
00:44:00.655 --> 00:44:03.191
Moved the screws to rehang it.
Yep.

526
00:44:07.662 --> 00:44:09.139
What the fuck is that?

527
00:44:10.623 --> 00:44:12.075
Switchblade.

528
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.218
Goddamn it.

529
00:44:25.305 --> 00:44:27.883
There must be something.

530
00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:35.282
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

531
00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:45.759
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

532
00:44:47.202 --> 00:44:49.245
See this? This is us.

533
00:44:49.871 --> 00:44:50.914
Yeah.

534
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.707
Just wait a minute.

535
00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.253
Now Somerset's climbing on the furniture.

536
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.380
Just wait a minute.

537
00:45:04.427 --> 00:45:06.095
You're kidding me.

538
00:45:06.554 --> 00:45:08.723
Call the Print Lab.

539
00:45:13.645 --> 00:45:15.263
Oh, man.

540
00:45:18.441 --> 00:45:22.571
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

541
00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:25.999
No.

542
00:45:28.243 --> 00:45:31.079
I can tell you, guys, just by
looking at the swirl pattern...

543
00:45:31.454 --> 00:45:33.873
they're not the victim's fingerprints.

544
00:45:44.092 --> 00:45:48.596
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

545
00:45:49.889 --> 00:45:51.015
It doesn't fit.

546
00:45:51.808 --> 00:45:54.561
He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
Who knows?

547
00:45:54.727 --> 00:45:58.731
So many freaks out there doing their
little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

548
00:45:58.898 --> 00:46:01.985
The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

549
00:46:02.151 --> 00:46:03.945
Jodie Foster told me to do it.

550
00:46:04.112 --> 00:46:08.065
You know, um, I've seen this baby take as
long as three days to make a match,

551
00:46:08.066 --> 00:46:10.969
so maybe you guys wanna cross
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:14.747 --> 00:46:17.458
You meant what you said to
Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

553
00:46:17.625 --> 00:46:20.137
About catching this guy.
Yeah.

554
00:46:22.964 --> 00:46:25.484
Wish I still thought the way you do.

555
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.505
Why don't you tell me what the hell
it is you think we're doing then.

556
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.433
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:34.642 --> 00:46:39.439
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

558
00:46:39.606 --> 00:46:41.566
Writing everything down.

559
00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:44.402
Noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:45.486 --> 00:46:48.256
That's all?
That's all.

561
00:46:48.823 --> 00:46:52.169
Putting everything into neat
little piles and filing it away.

562
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:56.198
On the off chance it will ever
be needed in the courtroom.

563
00:46:59.292 --> 00:47:02.262
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

564
00:47:02.629 --> 00:47:05.874
Saving them in case we get rescued.

565
00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.178
Bullshit.

566
00:47:12.555 --> 00:47:16.451
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

567
00:47:17.852 --> 00:47:21.606
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

568
00:47:24.067 --> 00:47:27.979
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

569
00:47:28.821 --> 00:47:30.298
I saw you.

570
00:47:31.324 --> 00:47:33.368
We're getting somewhere.

571
00:47:48.883 --> 00:47:50.259
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

572
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.220
You've got a winner.

573
00:47:58.518 --> 00:48:00.405
This guy goes by the name of Victor.

574
00:48:00.819 --> 00:48:02.301
His real name is Theodore Allen.

575
00:48:02.355 --> 00:48:05.024
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

576
00:48:05.191 --> 00:48:08.653
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

577
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.990
His parents gave him a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

578
00:48:12.156 --> 00:48:14.826
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

579
00:48:15.201 --> 00:48:18.070
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

580
00:48:18.137 --> 00:48:21.808
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

581
00:48:21.874 --> 00:48:24.335
But his lawyer saw to it that didn't last long.

582
00:48:24.502 --> 00:48:27.088
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

583
00:48:27.255 --> 00:48:28.935
Greed murder victim.
Yes, sir.

584
00:48:29.007 --> 00:48:31.759
We're gonna finish this thing
up today, ladies and germs.

585
00:48:31.926 --> 00:48:35.930
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

586
00:48:36.097 --> 00:48:37.807
You're not buying all this, are you?

587
00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:41.936
Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
You tell me.

588
00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:44.605
Our killer seems to have more purpose.

589
00:49:13.634 --> 00:49:14.927
You ever take a bullet?

590
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.265
Never in my 34 years, knock wood.

591
00:49:20.224 --> 00:49:23.770
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

592
00:49:24.437 --> 00:49:25.772
Never pulled the trigger.

593
00:49:25.938 --> 00:49:27.199
Not once.

594
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:29.150
You?

595
00:49:29.317 --> 00:49:32.245
Yeah, but, no, I never took a...
I never took a bullet.

596
00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:35.503
But I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

597
00:49:35.656 --> 00:49:37.700
Really?
It was my first one of these.

598
00:49:37.867 --> 00:49:40.178
We were a secondary unit.

599
00:49:40.244 --> 00:49:42.831
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

600
00:49:43.498 --> 00:49:46.093
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and...

601
00:49:46.959 --> 00:49:49.137
the fucker just opened fire on us.

602
00:49:49.504 --> 00:49:51.297
One cop got hit in the arm.

603
00:49:53.341 --> 00:49:55.151
Christ, what was his name?

604
00:49:56.886 --> 00:49:58.888
Spun him like a top.

605
00:49:59.055 --> 00:50:01.240
You know, I mean,
more like slow motion.

606
00:50:02.767 --> 00:50:03.985
I remember...

607
00:50:05.853 --> 00:50:07.188
riding in that ambulance.

608
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.316
Well, he died right there.

609
00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:12.527
Right there.

610
00:50:12.902 --> 00:50:15.029
Christ, what was his fucking name?

611
00:50:27.917 --> 00:50:30.187
All rise.
Let's do it. Let's do it.

612
00:50:31.963 --> 00:50:33.707
Go, go, go. Move.

613
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:38.719
Ok.

614
00:50:57.738 --> 00:50:59.207
Get up there.

615
00:51:33.149 --> 00:51:35.294
SWAT goes before dicks.

616
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.520
Hey.

617
00:51:39.113 --> 00:51:40.899
They love this.

618
00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:43.534
Police.

619
00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:45.912
Clear.

620
00:51:47.955 --> 00:51:49.624
Clear.
Clear.

621
00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.000
Clear.

622
00:52:04.305 --> 00:52:05.806
Clear.

623
00:52:13.689 --> 00:52:15.566
Morning, sweetheart.

624
00:52:16.484 --> 00:52:17.985
Get up now, motherfucker.

625
00:52:18.152 --> 00:52:19.445
Now!

626
00:52:28.496 --> 00:52:30.539
Get up, you sack of shit.

627
00:52:37.088 --> 00:52:38.839
Oh, fuck me.

628
00:52:39.006 --> 00:52:42.577
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

629
00:52:45.972 --> 00:52:47.098
Dicks!

630
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.523
Jesus.

631
00:52:55.898 --> 00:52:57.733
Victor?
What the hell?

632
00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.151
Yeah, it's just Victor.

633
00:52:59.318 --> 00:53:01.279
Call an ambulance.
What is this?

634
00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:03.698
Hearse more like it.
Also Forensics.

635
00:53:03.864 --> 00:53:06.184
California, get your people out.
Go on now.

636
00:53:06.242 --> 00:53:07.702
No one touches anything.

637
00:53:07.868 --> 00:53:10.037
It's some frigging wax
sculpture or something.

638
00:53:14.166 --> 00:53:15.376
Sloth.

639
00:53:24.927 --> 00:53:26.178
Oh, man.

640
00:53:26.345 --> 00:53:28.139
Goddamn.

641
00:53:28.306 --> 00:53:31.017
Those pictures were dated three days ago.

642
00:53:38.983 --> 00:53:41.193
This must be the first one.
Look.

643
00:53:42.194 --> 00:53:44.530
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

644
00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:52.580
I got a hair sample, I got a stool
sample, I got piss, I got fingernails.

645
00:53:54.623 --> 00:53:56.109
He's laughing at us.

646
00:53:56.323 --> 00:53:58.082
You got what you deserved.

647
00:54:01.547 --> 00:54:03.174
He's alive, he's alive!

648
00:54:03.341 --> 00:54:05.261
That cocksucker's alive!
Guns down.

649
00:54:05.301 --> 00:54:08.262
Still breathing!
Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!

650
00:54:16.103 --> 00:54:17.188
Coming through.

651
00:54:25.446 --> 00:54:27.932
He's playing games.
No shit.

652
00:54:30.425 --> 00:54:32.744
Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.

653
00:54:33.621 --> 00:54:35.989
No matter how hard it is we have
to remain focused on the details.

654
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.958
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?

655
00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:40.920
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I can hear you.

656
00:54:41.087 --> 00:54:42.713
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

657
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.832
Closed crime scene, get the fuck out here.
I got a right to be here.

658
00:54:45.833 --> 00:54:47.209
UPI photographer.
Get out here. Get out here!

659
00:54:47.276 --> 00:54:49.976
Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
Get out of here.

660
00:54:50.096 --> 00:54:51.414
Get out here!
Fucking jerk.

661
00:54:51.427 --> 00:54:53.213
Jesus. Fuck you.
I got your picture, man.

662
00:54:53.227 --> 00:54:53.921
Oh, yeah?

663
00:54:53.974 --> 00:54:55.175
I got your picture.
Oh, yeah?

664
00:54:55.601 --> 00:54:58.646
Detective Mills, M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.

665
00:54:58.813 --> 00:55:01.107
I'm surprised you can spell.
Fuck you.

666
00:55:01.857 --> 00:55:04.093
How do they get here so fucking quick?

667
00:55:04.652 --> 00:55:06.737
They pay police for the information.

668
00:55:06.904 --> 00:55:07.947
And they pay well.

669
00:55:08.823 --> 00:55:10.783
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...

670
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:12.018
Those...

671
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.296
You know, they piss me off.
It's Ok.

672
00:55:15.663 --> 00:55:18.265
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

673
00:55:25.131 --> 00:55:27.274
A year of immobility seems about right,

674
00:55:27.341 --> 00:55:30.261
judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.

675
00:55:30.428 --> 00:55:33.931
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

676
00:55:34.098 --> 00:55:35.349
Even an antibiotic,

677
00:55:35.516 --> 00:55:39.728
which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.

678
00:55:39.895 --> 00:55:43.558
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

679
00:55:44.024 --> 00:55:46.694
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

680
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.538
he chewed off his own tongue long ago.

681
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.425
Doc.

682
00:55:54.118 --> 00:55:56.671
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

683
00:55:57.872 --> 00:56:02.369
Detective, he'd die of shock right now if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.

684
00:56:03.335 --> 00:56:07.046
He's experienced about as much pain and
suffering as anyone I've encountered.

685
00:56:07.047 --> 00:56:08.883
Give or take.

686
00:56:09.341 --> 00:56:11.744
And he still has hell to look forward to.

687
00:56:12.595 --> 00:56:13.637
Good night.

688
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:28.235
Yeah?
<i>Hello, William?</i>

689
00:56:28.402 --> 00:56:32.114
<i>It's Tracy.</i>
Tracy?

690
00:56:32.281 --> 00:56:36.619
Is everything all right?
<i>Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>

691
00:56:36.785 --> 00:56:38.454
Where's David?
<i>He's just...</i>

692
00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:40.998
<i>He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.</i>

693
00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.884
<i>I'm sorry to call you like this.</i>

694
00:56:44.251 --> 00:56:45.828
Oh, it's all right...

695
00:56:46.587 --> 00:56:48.130
What can I do for you, Tracy?

696
00:56:49.673 --> 00:56:51.058
I...

697
00:56:53.928 --> 00:56:55.804
I need someone to talk,

698
00:56:55.971 --> 00:56:58.410
to do you think you could meet me,

699
00:56:59.124 --> 00:57:00.901
somewhere maybe tomorrow morning?

700
00:57:02.269 --> 00:57:04.138
I don't understand.

701
00:57:05.064 --> 00:57:07.950
<i>I feel stupid calling, but...</i>

702
00:57:09.235 --> 00:57:12.613
you're the only person that I know here.

703
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.114
There's no one else.

704
00:57:14.698 --> 00:57:18.744
<i>If you can, just, give me a call, Ok?</i>

705
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:20.913
<i>I have to go now.</i>

706
00:57:21.455 --> 00:57:23.791
<i>Well, good night.</i>
Good night.

707
00:57:33.092 --> 00:57:36.929
I mean, you know this city so well.

708
00:57:37.096 --> 00:57:41.058
You've been here so long.

709
00:57:41.976 --> 00:57:44.311
It can be a hard place.

710
00:57:44.687 --> 00:57:47.147
I don't know why I asked you to come.

711
00:57:48.983 --> 00:57:51.277
Why don't you talk to him about it?

712
00:57:51.443 --> 00:57:53.112
Tell him how you feel.

713
00:57:54.321 --> 00:57:57.157
I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.

714
00:57:57.324 --> 00:57:59.410
Especially now.

715
00:58:01.161 --> 00:58:03.163
I'll get used to things.

716
00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:05.291
You know? I think I just,

717
00:58:05.457 --> 00:58:09.753
I wanted to talk to someone who's
lived here for a long time and...

718
00:58:10.087 --> 00:58:15.702
I mean, upstate, you know, it's a
completely different environment.

719
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:21.473
Did David tell you that I teach fifth grade?

720
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.309
Well, I did.

721
00:58:25.019 --> 00:58:26.904
He mentioned it.

722
00:58:30.149 --> 00:58:33.094
I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.

723
00:58:35.529 --> 00:58:39.467
But the conditions here are horrible.

724
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.541
What about private schools?

725
00:58:45.372 --> 00:58:47.133
I don't know.

726
00:58:48.375 --> 00:58:51.145
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.

727
00:58:53.714 --> 00:58:55.742
David and I are gonna have a baby.

728
00:59:00.804 --> 00:59:02.806
Oh, Tracy, I...

729
00:59:03.932 --> 00:59:05.809
I don't think I'm the...

730
00:59:05.976 --> 00:59:08.070
I'm the one to talk to about this.

731
00:59:08.437 --> 00:59:10.389
I hate this city.

732
00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:16.729
I had a relationship once.

733
00:59:17.404 --> 00:59:19.406
It was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:22.368 --> 00:59:23.811
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:25.204 --> 00:59:27.206
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:33.128 --> 00:59:36.023
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:38.258 --> 00:59:42.471
Just another day like any other, except it
was the first day after I knew about...

738
00:59:43.555 --> 00:59:45.182
the pregnancy.

739
00:59:46.308 --> 00:59:51.438
And I felt this fear for the first time ever.

740
00:59:53.524 --> 00:59:57.861
I remember thinking how can I bring
a child into a world like this?

741
00:59:58.028 --> 01:00:01.982
How can? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

742
01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:12.209
I told her I didn't want to have it.

743
01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:16.004
And over the next few weeks...

744
01:00:17.423 --> 01:00:19.425
I wore her down.

745
01:00:21.802 --> 01:00:24.054
I wanna have children.

746
01:00:28.475 --> 01:00:30.511
I can tell you now...

747
01:00:31.353 --> 01:00:33.480
I'm... I know, I mean...

748
01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:39.611
I'm positive that I made the right decision.

749
01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:42.172
But there's not a day that passes,

750
01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:46.102
that I don't wish that I had made
a different choice.

751
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.116
If you don't keep...

752
01:00:53.834 --> 01:00:57.337
The baby, I mean, if that's your decision...

753
01:00:59.173 --> 01:01:01.592
don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.

754
01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:06.622
But if you choose to have this baby...

755
01:01:07.222 --> 01:01:09.968
you spoil that kid every chance you get.

756
01:01:17.399 --> 01:01:21.937
That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.

757
01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:30.771
I got to go.

758
01:01:31.038 --> 01:01:32.206
William.

759
01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:40.631
Thank you.

760
01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:58.482
Victor's landlord said there was an
envelope of cash in the office mailbox,

761
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:00.234
the first of every month.

762
01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:06.357
Quote,

763
01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:10.285
I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.

764
01:02:10.452 --> 01:02:13.080
And nobody ever complained about him.

765
01:02:13.247 --> 01:02:15.833
He's the best tenant I've ever had, end quote.

766
01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.918
Yeah, a landlord's dream.

767
01:02:18.085 --> 01:02:19.753
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

768
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.547
Who pays the rent on time.

769
01:02:22.714 --> 01:02:25.592
I'm sick of all this waiting.
This is the job.

770
01:02:27.052 --> 01:02:28.387
Why aren't we out there?

771
01:02:28.554 --> 01:02:33.467
Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?

772
01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:36.812
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.

773
01:02:36.979 --> 01:02:39.606
Come on, he's insane.
Look.

774
01:02:39.773 --> 01:02:43.735
Right now he's probably dancing
around in his grandma's panties.

775
01:02:43.902 --> 01:02:46.564
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.

776
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:49.758
How's that?
I don't think so.

777
01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:53.262
His luck will run out.

778
01:02:54.288 --> 01:02:56.498
Not depending on luck.

779
01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:03.479
We walked into that apartment exactly one
year after he tied Victor to the bed.

780
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.399
One year to the day.

781
01:03:05.465 --> 01:03:07.759
He wanted us to.
Don't know that for sure.

782
01:03:07.926 --> 01:03:09.278
Oh, yes, we do.

783
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.389
This note he left.

784
01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:14.266
His first words to us.

785
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:18.290
Long is the way and hard,
that out of Hell leads up to light,.

786
01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:22.107
Fuck him. So what?

787
01:03:22.274 --> 01:03:23.851
He's right, so far.

788
01:03:24.318 --> 01:03:28.422
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

789
01:03:28.989 --> 01:03:32.826
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

790
01:03:32.993 --> 01:03:35.787
To insert tubes into his genitals.

791
01:03:36.204 --> 01:03:41.001
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

792
01:03:41.376 --> 01:03:43.128
He's a nut bag.

793
01:03:43.295 --> 01:03:46.849
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

794
01:03:51.887 --> 01:03:53.153
How much money you got?

795
01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:55.236
I got like 50. 50 bucks.

796
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.652
I propose a field trip. Come on.

797
01:04:01.688 --> 01:04:02.689
We'll make a list.

798
01:04:02.856 --> 01:04:05.692
At the top we'll put Purgatory,
Canterbury Tales.

799
01:04:05.859 --> 01:04:08.487
Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

800
01:04:08.654 --> 01:04:10.113
Ask yourself...
Hey, wait, wait.

801
01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.033
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

802
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.643
What are his interests now?

803
01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:17.337
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

804
01:04:17.704 --> 01:04:19.624
Where are we going?
Library.

805
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.597
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.

806
01:04:35.764 --> 01:04:38.183
Discount... Discount coupons.

807
01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:43.730
They must've had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

808
01:04:43.897 --> 01:04:48.368
Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.

809
01:04:48.735 --> 01:04:50.737
Give me your money.

810
01:04:51.738 --> 01:04:55.934
I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what the fuck we're doing.

811
01:04:58.578 --> 01:04:59.580
Fuck.

812
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:03.125
Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
Ok.

813
01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:06.753
Didn't figure this was a ménage á trois.
It's not a problem.

814
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.588
Sit down.

815
01:05:12.926 --> 01:05:14.907
Only for you do I do this,

816
01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:16.643
it's a big risk.

817
01:05:16.763 --> 01:05:19.099
So I figure we're just fair and square.

818
01:05:19.266 --> 01:05:21.476
It's a deal.
All right.

819
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.890
About an hour.

820
01:05:28.942 --> 01:05:30.736
Yeah, help yourself.

821
01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.032
Well, that was money well spent.

822
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.284
Yeah.

823
01:05:45.459 --> 01:05:46.552
All right.

824
01:05:46.918 --> 01:05:50.396
By telling you this, I'm trusting
you more than I trust most people.

825
01:05:50.397 --> 01:05:52.391
Well, good, because I'm ready to punch you.

826
01:05:54.843 --> 01:05:58.514
It's probably nothing, but even if it is,
it's no skin off our teeth.

827
01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:04.603
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

828
01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:07.731
Who, stinky man?

829
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:12.694
See, for years the FBI's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.

830
01:06:13.561 --> 01:06:14.574
Assessing fines?

831
01:06:14.588 --> 01:06:16.612
No, monitoring reading habits.

832
01:06:17.365 --> 01:06:18.700
Look.
What?

833
01:06:18.867 --> 01:06:20.744
Certain books are flagged.

834
01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:23.154
Books on say, nuclear weapons and,

835
01:06:23.868 --> 01:06:25.112
well, Mein Kampf.

836
01:06:25.665 --> 01:06:27.542
Anyone who checks out a flagged book,

837
01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:30.670
has his library records fed
into the FBI's computers then on.

838
01:06:30.837 --> 01:06:32.839
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?

839
01:06:33.006 --> 01:06:35.842
Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

840
01:06:37.344 --> 01:06:40.915
You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.

841
01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:45.441
It might sound silly but you can't get
a library card without an...

842
01:06:45.642 --> 01:06:48.171
ID and a current phone bill, see?

843
01:06:50.357 --> 01:06:52.826
So they run a list.
Precisely.

844
01:06:53.193 --> 01:06:56.771
If you wanna know who's reading
Purgatory and Paradise Lost,

845
01:06:56.838 --> 01:07:01.243
and Helter Skelter,
the FBI's computers will tell us.

846
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:03.870
It could give us a name.
It could.

847
01:07:04.037 --> 01:07:08.174
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.

848
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.877
At least you're out of the office.

849
01:07:11.044 --> 01:07:12.754
Get a haircut.

850
01:07:13.713 --> 01:07:15.632
How do you know all this?
I don't.

851
01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:18.327
Neither do you.
Exactly.

852
01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:30.981
The Divine Comedy.
History of Catholicism.

853
01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:33.316
There's a book called
Murderers and Madmen.

854
01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:37.079
Modern Homicide Investigation,
In Cold Blood.

855
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:39.713
Of Human Bondage. Bondage?

856
01:07:39.714 --> 01:07:41.108
Not what you think.
Ok.

857
01:07:42.075 --> 01:07:44.244
The Marquis de Sade.

858
01:07:44.411 --> 01:07:46.246
It's the Marquis de Sade.
Whatever.

859
01:07:46.413 --> 01:07:48.790
The Writings of Saint
Thomas Aqua... Something.

860
01:07:48.957 --> 01:07:51.209
Saint Thomas Aquinas.
There it is.

861
01:07:51.376 --> 01:07:53.612
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

862
01:07:54.379 --> 01:07:56.465
Is that it?
Yeah.

863
01:07:57.591 --> 01:07:59.927
Let's try it.
Jonathan Doe?

864
01:08:00.594 --> 01:08:01.678
Whatever.

865
01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.430
We're sure about that name?

866
01:08:03.597 --> 01:08:04.598
Yeah.

867
01:08:04.764 --> 01:08:07.109
You saw it, John Doe.

868
01:08:07.475 --> 01:08:09.295
You wanna go back, I'll go back.

869
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:12.314
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

870
01:08:13.064 --> 01:08:14.608
This is crazy.

871
01:08:14.774 --> 01:08:16.369
Ah, we'll just talk to him.

872
01:08:17.736 --> 01:08:20.456
Excuse me, sir. Are you by
any chance a serial killer?

873
01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:23.659
Ok.

874
01:08:24.326 --> 01:08:25.903
You do the talking.

875
01:08:26.995 --> 01:08:29.164
Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
No.

876
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:30.883
You been talking to my wife?

877
01:08:34.502 --> 01:08:36.555
This is retarded.

878
01:08:36.922 --> 01:08:38.715
Charlie's Fucking Angels.

879
01:08:39.466 --> 01:08:41.485
A name off a computer.

880
01:08:45.222 --> 01:08:46.506
Mills.

881
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.332
Fuck.

882
01:08:57.317 --> 01:08:58.853
You hit?
No.

883
01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:04.041
He's going down, he's going down!

884
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.959
Fifth floor.

885
01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:23.485
Mills.

886
01:09:25.512 --> 01:09:26.814
Mommy?

887
01:09:28.181 --> 01:09:29.316
Mommy?

888
01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:44.323
Police. Is there a back way out?

889
01:09:45.323 --> 01:09:46.366
Lock your door.

890
01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:51.580
What the hell is going on, man?
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

891
01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.982
Get down.

892
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:20.233
Hey.

893
01:10:20.775 --> 01:10:22.110
Get the fuck down.

894
01:10:55.769 --> 01:10:56.854
Shit.

895
01:10:58.772 --> 01:11:01.274
Get the fuck out of there.

896
01:11:13.119 --> 01:11:15.790
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

897
01:11:59.207 --> 01:12:00.417
Goddamn it.

898
01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.003
Fuck.

899
01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.073
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

900
01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:07.627
Mills?

901
01:14:09.128 --> 01:14:10.797
No.

902
01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:32.227
Mills.

903
01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:37.991
Mills, you Ok?
I'm all right.

904
01:14:40.159 --> 01:14:41.828
I'm all right.

905
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.670
Where are you going?
I'm going in.

906
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:49.328
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

907
01:14:50.461 --> 01:14:52.130
Wait.
What are you talking about?

908
01:14:52.297 --> 01:14:53.673
He shot at us.
You can't.

909
01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.633
The hell we can't.
We need a warrant.

910
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.510
We got probable cause.
Come on.

911
01:14:57.677 --> 01:14:58.845
Think about it, think.

912
01:14:59.012 --> 01:15:00.113
How did we get here?

913
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.349
I can't tell anyone this.
Oh, come on.

914
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.204
I can't tell anyone.
Get out of the way.

915
01:15:04.258 --> 01:15:05.835
We have no reason to be here.

916
01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.262
Will you listen to me?
Get off.

917
01:15:07.275 --> 01:15:10.263
Listen to me, listen.
Get the fuck off me.

918
01:15:10.264 --> 01:15:11.491
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

919
01:15:11.858 --> 01:15:13.660
But would you
just pay attention a minute?

920
01:15:14.527 --> 01:15:17.822
If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

921
01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:20.658
The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?

922
01:15:20.825 --> 01:15:23.620
By the time we clear a warrant,
someone else... No, fuck that.

923
01:15:23.786 --> 01:15:27.324
We need a reason to knock on this door.
No, no.

924
01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.118
Think about it.

925
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:32.854
Ok?

926
01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.383
Ok, man. Ok.

927
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:40.094
You're right.
I'm all fucked up.

928
01:15:40.261 --> 01:15:41.521
When you're right, you're right.

929
01:15:50.104 --> 01:15:54.217
Well, no point in arguing anymore.

930
01:15:55.318 --> 01:15:56.903
Unless you can fix that.

931
01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:01.449
You stupid son of a...

932
01:16:09.874 --> 01:16:11.534
How much money we got left?

933
01:16:12.627 --> 01:16:13.726
So, yeah like,

934
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.352
I noticed this guy going out a lot.

935
01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:18.825
When the murders was happening, so I...

936
01:16:19.592 --> 01:16:22.294
So...
So you called Detective Somerset, right?

937
01:16:22.295 --> 01:16:26.869
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit and,

938
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.467
one of the murders,
it happened right over there.

939
01:16:29.468 --> 01:16:31.996
Ok. Ok. Ok. I told you the rest. You got it?
Called the cops.

940
01:16:32.063 --> 01:16:33.106
Good?
Got your story.

941
01:16:33.272 --> 01:16:35.082
Have her sign. You gotta sign.
Ok.

942
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:37.402
Ok?
Good, good, good.

943
01:16:37.568 --> 01:16:40.079
All right.
You did good.

944
01:16:40.446 --> 01:16:42.540
I did what you said.
Here you go.

945
01:16:42.907 --> 01:16:45.451
You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.

946
01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.265
Everybody, stay outside.

947
01:17:51.976 --> 01:17:53.561
Victor.

948
01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:07.821
Somerset!

949
01:20:09.947 --> 01:20:11.148
Somerset!

950
01:20:11.962 --> 01:20:12.962
Yeah?

951
01:20:16.871 --> 01:20:19.015
What?
We had him.

952
01:20:19.707 --> 01:20:21.375
What are you talking about?

953
01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:25.004
The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.

954
01:20:29.508 --> 01:20:31.369
We had him and we let him go.

955
01:20:38.351 --> 01:20:39.894
You're sure this is him?

956
01:20:40.061 --> 01:20:41.354
Yup, good, good.
Yup.

957
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.240
Yeah, good, get it out.
All right.

958
01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:46.891
We've got nothing, no pay stubs, no
appointment books, no addresses.

959
01:20:46.892 --> 01:20:48.612
This is the best, this receipt.
Keep looking.

960
01:20:48.694 --> 01:20:50.655
Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.

961
01:20:51.421 --> 01:20:52.882
His only source of funds.

962
01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.284
No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.

963
01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:56.691
Wait. There's one more thing and
you won't believe this.

964
01:20:56.702 --> 01:20:58.122
You're probably not gonna believe this.

965
01:20:58.236 --> 01:20:59.677
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.

966
01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:02.542
Not a single one.
You're right, I don't believe you.

967
01:21:02.555 --> 01:21:03.847
Keep looking.

968
01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:10.091
We could use some
more men here.

969
01:21:10.257 --> 01:21:13.678
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?

970
01:21:13.844 --> 01:21:16.012
There are 2000 notebooks on these shelves.

971
01:21:16.013 --> 01:21:18.891
And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.

972
01:21:19.058 --> 01:21:20.886
Forget it.
Anything about the killings?

973
01:21:22.103 --> 01:21:26.315
What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.

974
01:21:26.482 --> 01:21:30.403
What fun we have dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.

975
01:21:30.569 --> 01:21:32.238
Not knowing that we are nothing.

976
01:21:32.405 --> 01:21:34.657
We are not what was intended.

977
01:21:34.824 --> 01:21:36.843
No, wait, there's a lot more.

978
01:21:38.244 --> 01:21:41.580
On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.

979
01:21:42.123 --> 01:21:46.252
He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.

980
01:21:46.419 --> 01:21:48.546
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.

981
01:21:48.713 --> 01:21:51.407
But my head began to hurt
from his banality.

982
01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:56.137
I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

983
01:21:56.929 --> 01:22:01.126
He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing.

984
01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.961
No dates.

985
01:22:04.228 --> 01:22:07.165
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

986
01:22:08.482 --> 01:22:11.369
Just his mind poured out on paper.

987
01:22:11.736 --> 01:22:13.112
Looks like a life's work.

988
01:22:13.279 --> 01:22:16.823
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still take two months.

989
01:22:16.824 --> 01:22:19.076
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

990
01:22:22.663 --> 01:22:23.914
Where's that phone?

991
01:22:27.293 --> 01:22:28.778
Phone? Phone?

992
01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:30.129
Phone?

993
01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:35.051
People, quiet.

994
01:22:49.982 --> 01:22:52.218
Hello?
<i>I admire you.</i>

995
01:22:53.652 --> 01:22:56.639
<i>I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.</i>

996
01:22:57.990 --> 01:23:01.118
<i>I respect you law enforcement
agents more every day.</i>

997
01:23:01.285 --> 01:23:04.330
Well, I appreciate that, John.

998
01:23:04.497 --> 01:23:06.298
I tell you...
<i>No, listen, all right?</i>

999
01:23:06.373 --> 01:23:10.461
<i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.</i>

1000
01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:13.047
<i>I just had to call and
express my admiration.</i>

1001
01:23:13.214 --> 01:23:16.050
<i>Sorry I had to hurt one of you,</i>

1002
01:23:16.217 --> 01:23:18.844
<i>but I didn't really have a choice, did I?</i>

1003
01:23:19.011 --> 01:23:20.731
<i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>

1004
01:23:20.888 --> 01:23:23.307
<i>I feel like saying more, but I
don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>

1005
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:31.189
<i>Adjusting my schedule
after today's little setback.</i>

1006
01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:32.408
Got it.

1007
01:23:37.029 --> 01:23:38.564
All right, everybody, back to work.

1008
01:23:40.866 --> 01:23:42.184
You were right.

1009
01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:45.138
He's preaching.
Yeah.

1010
01:23:46.664 --> 01:23:48.666
These murders are his sermons to us.

1011
01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:52.378
Look, we know him, we know him.

1012
01:23:55.172 --> 01:23:56.924
Who's the blonde?

1013
01:24:00.928 --> 01:24:02.555
Looks like a pro.

1014
01:24:02.721 --> 01:24:03.940
Maybe.

1015
01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:06.042
She caught John Doe's eye.

1016
01:24:11.897 --> 01:24:14.441
Yeah, he came and collected it last night.

1017
01:24:14.608 --> 01:24:16.010
Last night?
Yeah.

1018
01:24:16.277 --> 01:24:18.202
This man?
Yeah, John Doe.

1019
01:24:18.203 --> 01:24:20.314
It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1020
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:21.943
What was this job you did for him?

1021
01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:24.022
I've got a picture of it. Hang on.

1022
01:24:24.076 --> 01:24:25.845
One sweet piece, actually.

1023
01:24:26.412 --> 01:24:29.748
I thought he was one of them performance
artists, that's what I thought.

1024
01:24:29.915 --> 01:24:33.732
You know, the sort of guy that
pisses in a cup on stage and,

1025
01:24:34.246 --> 01:24:35.684
then drinks it.

1026
01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:37.315
Performance art.

1027
01:24:41.135 --> 01:24:43.304
I think I undercharged him, actually.

1028
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:44.722
You made this for him?

1029
01:24:44.889 --> 01:24:47.600
Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1030
01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:54.916
They found the blonde.

1031
01:24:58.194 --> 01:24:59.412
The picture.

1032
01:24:59.778 --> 01:25:00.988
The picture.

1033
01:25:02.615 --> 01:25:04.033
Fucking pigs.

1034
01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.080
We need you to move, pal.
I'll come out, but you guys...

1035
01:25:09.121 --> 01:25:12.458
Get the fuck out of the booth.
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1036
01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:14.835
Ok?
I'm not fucking with you.

1037
01:25:15.002 --> 01:25:16.154
Come on, this way.

1038
01:25:23.469 --> 01:25:25.262
Can you do something about this music?

1039
01:25:25.429 --> 01:25:27.557
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1040
01:25:40.778 --> 01:25:42.488
You from Homicide?
You...

1041
01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:44.615
You better see this.
Yeah. All right.

1042
01:25:46.367 --> 01:25:48.869
Hey, easy. Got him?

1043
01:25:50.996 --> 01:25:53.332
Get this thing off of me.

1044
01:25:53.707 --> 01:25:55.542
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!

1045
01:25:56.168 --> 01:25:57.753
Get this thing off of me!

1046
01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.922
Get this off!
Get him out of here, now.

1047
01:26:00.089 --> 01:26:01.548
Get him out of here, now!

1048
01:26:02.967 --> 01:26:04.894
Come on, I wanna hear it again.

1049
01:26:05.261 --> 01:26:08.014
Tell me again.
Just... I don't know.

1050
01:26:08.889 --> 01:26:12.017
You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.

1051
01:26:12.559 --> 01:26:13.886
No.
No.

1052
01:26:15.896 --> 01:26:17.564
He asked me if I was married.

1053
01:26:17.731 --> 01:26:20.984
And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Where was the girl?

1054
01:26:20.985 --> 01:26:23.237
The what? What?

1055
01:26:23.404 --> 01:26:25.864
The girl, the prostitute.
Where was she?

1056
01:26:26.073 --> 01:26:28.534
Someone comes to your establishment.

1057
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:31.537
They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little oh la la.

1058
01:26:31.704 --> 01:26:32.705
Whatever.

1059
01:26:33.372 --> 01:26:35.150
They got to come to you, yeah?

1060
01:26:36.917 --> 01:26:38.294
You didn't see anyone?

1061
01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:42.473
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1062
01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.094
Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.

1063
01:26:47.261 --> 01:26:50.639
Some guys are carrying
suitcases full of stuff.

1064
01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:53.134
She was just sitting on the bed.

1065
01:26:59.898 --> 01:27:02.234
Who tied her down?
You or him?

1066
01:27:02.735 --> 01:27:04.629
Do you like what you do for a living?

1067
01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:07.315
These things you see?
No.

1068
01:27:09.241 --> 01:27:10.709
No, I don't.

1069
01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:14.580
But that's life, isn't it?

1070
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:24.423
He had a gun and he made it happen.

1071
01:27:26.258 --> 01:27:27.968
He made me do it.

1072
01:27:28.135 --> 01:27:31.138
He put that thing on me.

1073
01:27:31.805 --> 01:27:34.233
And he made me wear it.

1074
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.004
Then he, he, he, told me to fuck her.

1075
01:27:40.064 --> 01:27:42.274
And I did. I fucked her.

1076
01:27:43.067 --> 01:27:44.526
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1077
01:27:44.693 --> 01:27:46.695
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1078
01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:50.491
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1079
01:27:51.075 --> 01:27:52.117
<i>Fuck.</i>

1080
01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.705
<i>Oh, God, God.</i>

1081
01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:59.750
<i>God, help me.
Please, please, help me.</i>

1082
01:27:59.917 --> 01:28:01.627
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

1083
01:28:18.936 --> 01:28:21.288
You know, this isn't gonna
have a happy ending.

1084
01:28:21.855 --> 01:28:24.575
It's not possible.
Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1085
01:28:27.486 --> 01:28:30.363
If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil,

1086
01:28:30.364 --> 01:28:34.525
I mean if he's Satan himself,
that might live up to our expectations,

1087
01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:37.404
but he's not the devil.

1088
01:28:38.831 --> 01:28:40.332
He's just a man.

1089
01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:42.235
You know...

1090
01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:46.638
see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things. These...

1091
01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:50.329
If you think you're preparing
me for hard times,

1092
01:28:50.543 --> 01:28:51.806
thank you but...

1093
01:28:52.261 --> 01:28:54.230
But you gotta be a hero.

1094
01:28:55.722 --> 01:28:57.133
You wanna be a champion.

1095
01:28:57.134 --> 01:28:59.130
Well let me tell you,
people don't want a champion.

1096
01:28:59.184 --> 01:29:01.687
They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.

1097
01:29:01.854 --> 01:29:03.505
How did you get like this?

1098
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:05.484
I wanna know.

1099
01:29:10.028 --> 01:29:12.331
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.

1100
01:29:14.074 --> 01:29:15.367
Go on.

1101
01:29:18.579 --> 01:29:21.813
I just don't think I can continue
to live in a place that embraces,

1102
01:29:21.927 --> 01:29:25.161
and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.

1103
01:29:26.044 --> 01:29:27.646
You're no different, no better.

1104
01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.207
I didn't say I was different or better.
I'm not.

1105
01:29:30.674 --> 01:29:33.519
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1106
01:29:33.886 --> 01:29:36.021
Apathy is a solution.

1107
01:29:36.388 --> 01:29:41.018
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1108
01:29:41.185 --> 01:29:41.696
Yeah.

1109
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:44.836
It's easier to steal what you
want than it is to earn it.

1110
01:29:45.063 --> 01:29:47.399
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1111
01:29:47.566 --> 01:29:50.360
Hell, love costs.
It takes effort and work.

1112
01:29:50.527 --> 01:29:53.237
We are talking about people
who are mentally ill.

1113
01:29:53.238 --> 01:29:55.949
We are talking about people,
fucking crazies.

1114
01:29:56.116 --> 01:29:57.576
No. No, we're not.
Yes, today.

1115
01:29:57.743 --> 01:30:00.996
We're talking about everyday life here.

1116
01:30:02.372 --> 01:30:04.650
You can't afford to be this naive.

1117
01:30:04.917 --> 01:30:06.202
Fuck off.

1118
01:30:06.668 --> 01:30:09.859
See, you should listen to yourself.

1119
01:30:10.273 --> 01:30:10.936
Yeah.

1120
01:30:11.089 --> 01:30:14.760
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1121
01:30:15.761 --> 01:30:17.596
So I don't care about people.

1122
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:19.473
It makes no sense.
You know why?

1123
01:30:19.932 --> 01:30:21.934
You care?
You wanna know?

1124
01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.603
Damn right.
And you're gonna make a difference?

1125
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:25.890
Whatever the point is,

1126
01:30:26.304 --> 01:30:29.079
is that I don't think you're quitting,

1127
01:30:29.233 --> 01:30:32.144
because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1128
01:30:32.611 --> 01:30:35.614
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1129
01:30:37.783 --> 01:30:41.203
You want me to agree with you and say,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1130
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:43.330
It's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess.

1131
01:30:43.497 --> 01:30:46.017
We should all go live in
a fucking log cabin.

1132
01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:48.794
But I won't.

1133
01:30:49.461 --> 01:30:51.188
I won't say that.

1134
01:30:52.422 --> 01:30:55.242
I don't agree with you.
I do not.

1135
01:30:59.471 --> 01:31:00.814
I can't.

1136
01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.976
I'm gonna go home.

1137
01:31:19.992 --> 01:31:21.360
Thank you, though.

1138
01:31:51.857 --> 01:31:53.692
I love you, honey.

1139
01:31:54.192 --> 01:31:55.720
So much.

1140
01:31:57.529 --> 01:31:58.931
So much.

1141
01:32:03.827 --> 01:32:05.279
I know.

1142
01:33:07.599 --> 01:33:09.502
911, what's your emergency?

1143
01:33:10.936 --> 01:33:11.978
Could you repeat that?

1144
01:33:12.145 --> 01:33:15.607
<i>I've gone and done it again.</i>

1145
01:33:25.659 --> 01:33:26.868
What have we got?

1146
01:33:27.202 --> 01:33:29.154
Sleeping pills.

1147
01:33:30.205 --> 01:33:31.790
Glued to one hand.

1148
01:33:31.957 --> 01:33:33.500
Telephone glued to the other.

1149
01:33:35.293 --> 01:33:36.461
You see what he did?

1150
01:33:37.587 --> 01:33:38.964
He sliced her up.

1151
01:33:39.589 --> 01:33:41.049
Then he bandaged her.

1152
01:33:41.633 --> 01:33:43.635
Call for help and you'll live.

1153
01:33:43.802 --> 01:33:45.896
But you'll be disfigured.

1154
01:33:46.972 --> 01:33:50.016
Or you can put yourself out of your own misery.

1155
01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:52.144
Come on.

1156
01:33:52.477 --> 01:33:53.645
Cut off her nose.

1157
01:33:53.812 --> 01:33:55.480
To spite her face.

1158
01:33:55.647 --> 01:33:58.316
And he did it very recently.

1159
01:34:05.365 --> 01:34:06.525
Listen.

1160
01:34:07.492 --> 01:34:09.825
I've decided to stay on till this is done.

1161
01:34:10.639 --> 01:34:12.610
I figure one of two things will happen.

1162
01:34:12.664 --> 01:34:17.294
We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.

1163
01:34:17.461 --> 01:34:19.525
Hey man, you don't have
to do me any favors.

1164
01:34:19.539 --> 01:34:20.685
Thank you, but I got it.

1165
01:34:20.839 --> 01:34:24.176
I'm requesting that you keep me
on as your partner for a few more days.

1166
01:34:24.342 --> 01:34:25.761
You'd be doing me a favor.

1167
01:34:36.938 --> 01:34:38.482
You knew I'd say yes.

1168
01:34:38.648 --> 01:34:40.249
Hey, we're here.
Wonderful.

1169
01:34:40.275 --> 01:34:43.037
Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.

1170
01:34:45.906 --> 01:34:47.274
Detective?

1171
01:34:48.784 --> 01:34:51.036
After this, I'm gone.
Detective?

1172
01:34:51.536 --> 01:34:52.966
No big surprise.

1173
01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:54.252
Detective!

1174
01:34:57.042 --> 01:34:58.418
You're looking for me.

1175
01:34:58.877 --> 01:34:59.878
Hey!

1176
01:35:01.254 --> 01:35:03.715
Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.

1177
01:35:03.882 --> 01:35:05.075
Keep away from him!

1178
01:35:05.342 --> 01:35:07.062
On the fucking floor.
I know you.

1179
01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:08.595
Now. Get down.

1180
01:35:09.304 --> 01:35:12.015
Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.

1181
01:35:12.182 --> 01:35:14.059
Now. All the way!

1182
01:35:14.226 --> 01:35:16.394
All the way, fucker! Down!

1183
01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:19.105
Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.

1184
01:35:19.272 --> 01:35:22.026
Now. Nose on the ground.

1185
01:35:25.362 --> 01:35:28.156
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this?

1186
01:35:28.323 --> 01:35:31.493
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.

1187
01:35:33.245 --> 01:35:34.721
Goddamn it.

1188
01:35:36.915 --> 01:35:39.450
He cuts the skin off the tips
of his fingers.

1189
01:35:39.451 --> 01:35:43.689
That's why we couldn't find one
single usable print in his apartment.

1190
01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:46.007
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1191
01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:48.593
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1192
01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.595
So far everything's a dead end.

1193
01:35:50.762 --> 01:35:53.515
No credit history.
No employment records.

1194
01:35:53.682 --> 01:35:57.435
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1195
01:35:57.602 --> 01:35:59.479
We're even trying to trace his furniture.

1196
01:35:59.646 --> 01:36:02.065
About only thing we know
about that guy right now,

1197
01:36:02.232 --> 01:36:07.070
is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1198
01:36:07.237 --> 01:36:09.239
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1199
01:36:09.406 --> 01:36:11.950
Ok, so when do we get to question him?
You don't.

1200
01:36:12.117 --> 01:36:13.952
He going to court now.
What?

1201
01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:16.580
I'm telling you, there's no
way he'd turn himself in.

1202
01:36:16.746 --> 01:36:18.373
It doesn't make any sense.

1203
01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:22.127
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1204
01:36:22.294 --> 01:36:24.963
He's not finished.
No, he's pissing in our faces.

1205
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:26.925
We're just taking it like idiots.

1206
01:36:27.239 --> 01:36:29.297
You know what I'm talking about.

1207
01:36:29.551 --> 01:36:33.471
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1208
01:36:33.722 --> 01:36:35.123
He wouldn't just stop.

1209
01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:37.155
So, what the fuck, man?

1210
01:36:37.309 --> 01:36:40.520
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1211
01:36:41.938 --> 01:36:43.824
We'll wait for his plea.

1212
01:36:47.152 --> 01:36:49.265
My client says there are two more bodies.

1213
01:36:49.378 --> 01:36:51.253
Two more victims, hidden away.

1214
01:36:51.907 --> 01:36:54.701
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies,

1215
01:36:54.868 --> 01:36:59.039
but only Detective Mills and
Somerset, only at 6:00 today.

1216
01:36:59.205 --> 01:37:00.290
Why us?

1217
01:37:00.957 --> 01:37:02.417
He says he admires you.

1218
01:37:04.169 --> 01:37:05.503
It's part of the game.

1219
01:37:05.670 --> 01:37:10.362
The client claims if the detectives do not
accept this these bodies will never be found.

1220
01:37:10.376 --> 01:37:12.523
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1221
01:37:14.095 --> 01:37:15.347
We've got him.

1222
01:37:15.513 --> 01:37:17.724
Downstairs, locked up.
Done deal.

1223
01:37:17.891 --> 01:37:20.936
He's gonna get his free room and board,
get his free cable TV.

1224
01:37:21.102 --> 01:37:23.133
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.

1225
01:37:23.447 --> 01:37:24.877
Why are we having this conversation?

1226
01:37:24.931 --> 01:37:27.192
Mills.
Hey, something stinks.

1227
01:37:27.359 --> 01:37:28.892
And this one here in the street.

1228
01:37:28.893 --> 01:37:32.464
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face,

1229
01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:34.616
dealing for that shit, I don't like it...

1230
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.282
Mills.

1231
01:37:35.283 --> 01:37:37.535
I am required by law to serve my clients,

1232
01:37:37.702 --> 01:37:39.454
Oh, Jesus.
To the best of my ability.

1233
01:37:39.621 --> 01:37:43.083
To serve their best interest.
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1234
01:37:43.249 --> 01:37:45.834
My client also wishes inform you
that if you do not accept,

1235
01:37:45.835 --> 01:37:47.763
he will plead insanity across the board.

1236
01:37:48.630 --> 01:37:50.098
Let him try it.

1237
01:37:50.465 --> 01:37:51.591
I'd like to see him try.

1238
01:37:51.758 --> 01:37:54.761
Come on now, we all know
the extreme nature of these crimes,

1239
01:37:54.928 --> 01:37:57.047
I could get him off with such a plea.

1240
01:37:57.514 --> 01:38:00.225
I'm not letting this conviction slide.
I can tell you that.

1241
01:38:00.392 --> 01:38:03.920
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...

1242
01:38:04.187 --> 01:38:06.815
he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1243
01:38:07.190 --> 01:38:09.401
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1244
01:38:11.194 --> 01:38:12.621
Full confession.

1245
01:38:12.988 --> 01:38:13.687
I'm in.

1246
01:38:14.101 --> 01:38:15.696
It has to be the both of you.

1247
01:38:17.242 --> 01:38:22.206
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1248
01:38:22.872 --> 01:38:25.125
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1249
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:27.919
And my client would like
to remind you two more are dead.

1250
01:38:28.086 --> 01:38:29.753
Press would have a field day

1251
01:38:29.754 --> 01:38:32.716
if they find out the police didn't
seem concerned about finding them.

1252
01:38:32.882 --> 01:38:34.266
Giving them a proper burial.

1253
01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.107
Yeah if in fact there are two more dead.

1254
01:38:36.261 --> 01:38:40.432
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1255
01:38:40.598 --> 01:38:44.102
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1256
01:38:44.269 --> 01:38:46.796
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1257
01:38:47.063 --> 01:38:51.776
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1258
01:38:54.988 --> 01:38:57.073
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1259
01:39:00.118 --> 01:39:01.578
Let's finish it.

1260
01:39:05.206 --> 01:39:08.209
If John Doe's head splits
open and a UFO should fly out...

1261
01:39:08.626 --> 01:39:10.829
I want you to have expected it.

1262
01:39:12.797 --> 01:39:14.466
I will.

1263
01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.119
Hey, man, if I was to accidentally,

1264
01:39:18.133 --> 01:39:21.105
shave off a nipple would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1265
01:39:26.186 --> 01:39:27.971
I suppose so.

1266
01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.294
If you were man enough
to actually file a claim,

1267
01:39:32.308 --> 01:39:34.874
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1268
01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.074
If I keep coming home late,
my wife's gonna think something's up.

1269
01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:49.367
You know...

1270
01:39:50.835 --> 01:39:51.828
Yeah.

1271
01:39:57.967 --> 01:39:59.060
What?

1272
01:41:10.874 --> 01:41:11.883
Let's go.

1273
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:44.949
<i>C-Victor -5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>

1274
01:41:45.116 --> 01:41:46.367
<i>Pull around.</i>

1275
01:41:47.785 --> 01:41:50.872
<i>There it is. Late-model black
sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>

1276
01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:01.299
Who are you, John?

1277
01:42:02.383 --> 01:42:03.877
Who are you really?

1278
01:42:04.469 --> 01:42:05.553
What do you mean?

1279
01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.908
All I mean at this stage,

1280
01:42:06.922 --> 01:42:09.487
what harm can it do to tell
us a bit about yourself?

1281
01:42:09.974 --> 01:42:13.144
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1282
01:42:13.311 --> 01:42:15.230
You need to stay on your left up here.

1283
01:42:19.484 --> 01:42:21.194
So where are we heading?

1284
01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:22.904
You'll see.

1285
01:42:23.655 --> 01:42:26.558
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1286
01:42:27.659 --> 01:42:29.535
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1287
01:42:29.702 --> 01:42:32.330
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1288
01:42:33.915 --> 01:42:35.925
Wanting people to listen...

1289
01:42:36.292 --> 01:42:39.837
you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1290
01:42:40.004 --> 01:42:42.382
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1291
01:42:42.548 --> 01:42:45.510
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1292
01:42:45.677 --> 01:42:47.553
But the question is,

1293
01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:50.390
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1294
01:42:50.932 --> 01:42:52.058
I'm not special.

1295
01:42:53.184 --> 01:42:55.287
<i>I've never been exceptional.</i>

1296
01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.691
<i>This is though, what I'm doing.
My work.</i>

1297
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:01.442
Your work, John?

1298
01:43:02.026 --> 01:43:03.152
Yes.

1299
01:43:03.319 --> 01:43:06.581
See, I don't... I don't see
anything special about it, John.

1300
01:43:07.699 --> 01:43:08.741
That's not true.

1301
01:43:08.908 --> 01:43:09.993
No, it is true.

1302
01:43:10.159 --> 01:43:12.929
And the funny thing is, all this work...

1303
01:43:13.496 --> 01:43:15.498
two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1304
01:43:15.665 --> 01:43:18.001
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1305
01:43:18.167 --> 01:43:21.012
You can't see the whole complete act yet.

1306
01:43:21.963 --> 01:43:23.548
But when this is done...

1307
01:43:24.882 --> 01:43:26.217
when it's finished...

1308
01:43:28.052 --> 01:43:29.354
it's going to be...

1309
01:43:32.557 --> 01:43:35.193
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1310
01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.104
But they won't be able to deny.

1311
01:43:39.731 --> 01:43:41.390
Could the freak be any more vague?

1312
01:43:42.358 --> 01:43:44.610
I mean, as far as master plans go, John...

1313
01:43:44.777 --> 01:43:46.935
I can't wait for you to see.
I really can't.

1314
01:43:46.949 --> 01:43:48.627
It's really going to be something.

1315
01:43:49.699 --> 01:43:52.310
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing right next to you.

1316
01:43:52.577 --> 01:43:55.830
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1317
01:43:55.997 --> 01:43:59.500
Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
Oh, don't worry.

1318
01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:00.710
You won't.

1319
01:44:02.712 --> 01:44:04.739
You won't miss a thing.

1320
01:44:11.429 --> 01:44:14.724
<i>With the tour bus itself,
give two miles separation.</i>

1321
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:32.825
What's so exciting?

1322
01:44:34.035 --> 01:44:35.853
It's not too far now.

1323
01:44:39.665 --> 01:44:41.417
<i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>

1324
01:44:41.584 --> 01:44:42.752
<i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>

1325
01:44:43.378 --> 01:44:45.098
I've been trying to figure something,

1326
01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:47.516
in my head and maybe
you can help me out, yeah?

1327
01:44:49.634 --> 01:44:53.605
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1328
01:44:53.971 --> 01:44:55.907
do you know that you're insane?

1329
01:44:56.474 --> 01:44:58.893
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading Guns and Ammo,

1330
01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:02.113
masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go,

1331
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:05.983
Wow, it is amazing how
fucking crazy I really am?

1332
01:45:06.317 --> 01:45:08.153
Yeah. Do you guys do that?

1333
01:45:09.487 --> 01:45:12.156
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1334
01:45:12.323 --> 01:45:13.533
It's very comfortable.

1335
01:45:14.325 --> 01:45:17.362
It's not something I would
expect you to accept.

1336
01:45:18.037 --> 01:45:20.832
But I did not choose.
I was chosen.

1337
01:45:21.249 --> 01:45:24.477
Well, whatever.
I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1338
01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.507
But seems to me that you're
overlooking a glaring contradiction.

1339
01:45:29.674 --> 01:45:30.925
Meaning what?

1340
01:45:32.135 --> 01:45:33.753
Glad you asked.

1341
01:45:35.388 --> 01:45:37.014
If you were chosen...

1342
01:45:37.181 --> 01:45:40.518
that is, by a higher power...

1343
01:45:41.769 --> 01:45:43.604
and if your hand was forced...

1344
01:45:44.188 --> 01:45:47.275
it seems strange to me that you'd
get such enjoyment out of it.

1345
01:45:47.942 --> 01:45:50.820
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1346
01:45:51.529 --> 01:45:54.732
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1347
01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.210
John?

1348
01:46:02.248 --> 01:46:03.847
I doubt I enjoyed it any more,

1349
01:46:04.361 --> 01:46:08.505
than Detective Mills would enjoy time
alone with me in a room without windows.

1350
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:11.182
Isn't that true?

1351
01:46:11.716 --> 01:46:14.635
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1352
01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:15.887
That hurts my feelings.

1353
01:46:17.472 --> 01:46:20.641
I would never...
You wouldn't because there's consequences.

1354
01:46:22.143 --> 01:46:24.770
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1355
01:46:24.937 --> 01:46:27.607
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1356
01:46:28.357 --> 01:46:33.279
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1357
01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.533
Wait a minute, I thought all you
did was kill innocent people.

1358
01:46:39.535 --> 01:46:42.121
Innocent?
Is that supposed to be funny?

1359
01:46:42.997 --> 01:46:44.457
An obese man.

1360
01:46:44.624 --> 01:46:47.126
A disgusting man who
could barely stand up.

1361
01:46:47.293 --> 01:46:48.698
A man if you saw him in the street,

1362
01:46:48.712 --> 01:46:51.602
you'd point him out to your friends
so they'd join you in mocking him.

1363
01:46:51.756 --> 01:46:54.050
A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating,

1364
01:46:54.217 --> 01:46:56.061
you wouldn't be able to finish your meal.

1365
01:46:57.053 --> 01:46:58.463
And after him, I picked the lawyer.

1366
01:46:58.477 --> 01:47:00.811
You both must have to secretly
thank me for that one.

1367
01:47:01.098 --> 01:47:04.018
This is a man who dedicated his life,

1368
01:47:04.185 --> 01:47:08.814
to making money by lying with
every breath that he could muster,

1369
01:47:08.981 --> 01:47:11.859
to keeping murderers and
rapists on the streets.

1370
01:47:12.026 --> 01:47:13.444
Murderers?
A woman.

1371
01:47:13.611 --> 01:47:15.396
Murderers, John, like yourself?
A woman...

1372
01:47:15.863 --> 01:47:18.940
so ugly on the inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living

1373
01:47:18.941 --> 01:47:21.035
if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside?

1374
01:47:21.202 --> 01:47:25.323
A drug dealer.
A drug dealing pederast, actually.

1375
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:28.459
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1376
01:47:30.711 --> 01:47:32.830
Only in a world this shitty...

1377
01:47:33.297 --> 01:47:37.009
could you even try to say these
innocent people and keep a straight face.

1378
01:47:40.221 --> 01:47:41.698
But that's the point.

1379
01:47:43.266 --> 01:47:46.110
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner,

1380
01:47:46.477 --> 01:47:47.662
in every home,

1381
01:47:48.676 --> 01:47:49.768
and we tolerate it.

1382
01:47:50.022 --> 01:47:52.475
We tolerate it because it's common, it's...

1383
01:47:52.942 --> 01:47:54.410
It's trivial.

1384
01:47:54.777 --> 01:47:57.238
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.

1385
01:48:00.825 --> 01:48:02.594
Well, not anymore.

1386
01:48:04.996 --> 01:48:06.973
I'm setting the example.

1387
01:48:08.374 --> 01:48:09.984
And what I've done is gonna be,

1388
01:48:10.251 --> 01:48:12.003
puzzled over,

1389
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:14.005
and studied,

1390
01:48:14.797 --> 01:48:16.507
and followed,

1391
01:48:18.009 --> 01:48:19.051
forever.

1392
01:48:19.844 --> 01:48:21.137
Yeah.

1393
01:48:22.513 --> 01:48:24.849
Delusions of grandeur.

1394
01:48:25.725 --> 01:48:27.518
You should be thanking me.

1395
01:48:28.019 --> 01:48:29.228
Why's that, John?

1396
01:48:29.395 --> 01:48:32.523
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

1397
01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:36.527
Realize detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1398
01:48:36.694 --> 01:48:38.738
is that I wanted to be.

1399
01:48:38.904 --> 01:48:41.407
No. No, we would've got you eventually.

1400
01:48:41.574 --> 01:48:42.867
Oh, really?

1401
01:48:43.034 --> 01:48:44.764
So, what were you doing,

1402
01:48:44.778 --> 01:48:47.301
biding your time? Toying with me?

1403
01:48:47.872 --> 01:48:53.394
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

1404
01:48:53.461 --> 01:48:57.548
Tell me, what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me,

1405
01:48:57.715 --> 01:49:02.178
right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1406
01:49:02.345 --> 01:49:04.555
John, calm down.

1407
01:49:04.722 --> 01:49:07.099
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1408
01:49:07.433 --> 01:49:09.268
Oh, that's right.

1409
01:49:09.435 --> 01:49:12.772
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1410
01:49:17.526 --> 01:49:20.363
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.

1411
01:49:20.529 --> 01:49:22.490
Ok, sit back.
I spared you.

1412
01:49:22.657 --> 01:49:23.699
Sit back.

1413
01:49:23.866 --> 01:49:26.526
Remember that detective,
every time you look in the mirror,

1414
01:49:26.527 --> 01:49:29.138
at that face of yours
for the rest of your life,

1415
01:49:29.205 --> 01:49:30.258
or should I say,

1416
01:49:30.272 --> 01:49:31.657
for the rest of what life

1417
01:49:31.671 --> 01:49:33.443
I allow you to have.
Sit back!

1418
01:49:33.584 --> 01:49:37.171
Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1419
01:49:38.798 --> 01:49:41.550
You're no Messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1420
01:49:41.717 --> 01:49:45.104
You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1421
01:49:58.401 --> 01:50:00.653
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1422
01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:04.949
I don't mourn them any more than the
thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1423
01:50:05.282 --> 01:50:09.745
Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?

1424
01:50:12.998 --> 01:50:15.693
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1425
01:50:18.212 --> 01:50:20.339
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1426
01:50:20.798 --> 01:50:23.134
<i>That's where we're headed.
I see where is talking about.</i>

1427
01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.636
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock
and follow that access road.</i>

1428
01:50:31.976 --> 01:50:33.945
<i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>

1429
01:50:33.958 --> 01:50:37.773
<i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center. We're
in power-line city, deal with it.</i>

1430
01:50:39.275 --> 01:50:41.711
<i>This sure as shit is no ambush out here.</i>

1431
01:50:42.278 --> 01:50:45.130
<i>No fucking nothing out here.
Can't land anywhere near.</i>

1432
01:50:45.197 --> 01:50:47.933
<i>They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.</i>

1433
01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.953
<i>I want you to go up, way up.</i>

1434
01:50:50.619 --> 01:50:53.548
<i>Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.
Thirty seconds.</i>

1435
01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:57.261
I'm getting him out.

1436
01:51:59.647 --> 01:52:01.732
<i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>

1437
01:52:02.566 --> 01:52:03.567
<i>Got you in sight.</i>

1438
01:52:03.734 --> 01:52:05.152
<i>Get out.</i>

1439
01:52:05.694 --> 01:52:07.130
Slowly.

1440
01:52:07.822 --> 01:52:08.923
Stop.

1441
01:52:09.865 --> 01:52:11.008
Stay.

1442
01:52:14.161 --> 01:52:15.671
What do you got?

1443
01:52:16.997 --> 01:52:18.749
Dead dog.

1444
01:52:20.042 --> 01:52:21.585
I didn't do that.

1445
01:52:25.256 --> 01:52:27.424
<i>We're holding on standby, copy?</i>

1446
01:52:28.425 --> 01:52:29.510
What time is it?

1447
01:52:30.427 --> 01:52:32.913
Why?
I'd like to know.

1448
01:52:36.392 --> 01:52:37.476
7.01

1449
01:52:40.771 --> 01:52:41.856
It's close.

1450
01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.108
Let's go take a look.

1451
01:52:47.862 --> 01:52:48.904
It's this way.

1452
01:52:51.949 --> 01:52:53.993
<i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>

1453
01:52:54.159 --> 01:52:56.704
<i>This is Bird 2.
They're away from the car.</i>

1454
01:52:56.871 --> 01:52:59.039
<i>Coming in closer.</i>

1455
01:53:00.916 --> 01:53:04.295
<i>We got them.
We got them. Closing in.</i>

1456
01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:06.141
<i>Negative.
Negative. Hold your go.</i>

1457
01:53:32.072 --> 01:53:33.157
Mills?

1458
01:53:37.411 --> 01:53:40.056
Down, down, down.

1459
01:53:41.457 --> 01:53:42.958
Watch him.

1460
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:45.845
There he goes.

1461
01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:48.422
<i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>

1462
01:53:52.509 --> 01:53:53.928
<i>Van approaching.</i>

1463
01:53:54.094 --> 01:53:57.514
<i>Stay on the guy in red. Do not take
the cross hairs off the guy in red.</i>

1464
01:54:02.144 --> 01:54:04.772
<i>He's going out to meet
the van. Just stay down.</i>

1465
01:54:05.230 --> 01:54:08.000
There's a van coming down the road.
<i>From the north.</i>

1466
01:54:17.576 --> 01:54:20.162
Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.

1467
01:54:20.329 --> 01:54:21.756
Wait for me.

1468
01:54:27.378 --> 01:54:28.921
Get out of the van!

1469
01:54:30.839 --> 01:54:31.882
<i>Out!</i>

1470
01:54:32.049 --> 01:54:34.118
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't shoot me.

1471
01:54:34.385 --> 01:54:35.853
Step away.

1472
01:54:36.512 --> 01:54:38.722
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1473
01:54:38.889 --> 01:54:41.058
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

1474
01:54:41.225 --> 01:54:44.019
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
I'm just delivering a package, man.

1475
01:54:44.186 --> 01:54:45.896
I got this package for this guy, David.

1476
01:54:46.063 --> 01:54:49.058
Detective David Mills.

1477
01:54:56.323 --> 01:54:58.259
Get it.
Slowly.

1478
01:54:59.535 --> 01:55:02.079
<i>Stay alert.
He's opening the back of the van.</i>

1479
01:55:02.246 --> 01:55:03.914
<i>We've got him in sight.</i>

1480
01:55:10.170 --> 01:55:13.024
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1481
01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:15.776
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00.

1482
01:55:16.427 --> 01:55:17.728
Put it down.

1483
01:55:18.554 --> 01:55:19.888
We got a box.

1484
01:55:20.055 --> 01:55:24.351
<i>We got a box. Call the bomb squad.
I need a bomb squad. We got a box.</i>

1485
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:26.320
Face the van.

1486
01:55:26.895 --> 01:55:27.955
Hands up.

1487
01:55:35.779 --> 01:55:37.106
Turn around.

1488
01:55:38.282 --> 01:55:40.200
Ok. Go.
<i>Off you go. Go.</i>

1489
01:55:40.367 --> 01:55:42.494
<i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>

1490
01:55:43.412 --> 01:55:45.414
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1491
01:55:48.292 --> 01:55:50.678
<i>Got the driver in sight.
He's headed north along the road.</i>

1492
01:55:50.691 --> 01:55:51.967
Have him picked up.

1493
01:56:01.513 --> 01:56:03.232
Oh, I don't know.

1494
01:56:09.646 --> 01:56:11.148
I'm gonna open it.

1495
01:56:11.315 --> 01:56:14.694
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1496
01:56:33.837 --> 01:56:34.922
It's blood.

1497
01:56:35.089 --> 01:56:37.140
You've made quite a life
for yourself detective.

1498
01:56:37.917 --> 01:56:39.158
You should be very proud.

1499
01:56:39.172 --> 01:56:41.058
Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1500
01:56:55.025 --> 01:56:56.443
<i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>

1501
01:57:09.039 --> 01:57:10.499
California, stay away from here.

1502
01:57:10.666 --> 01:57:13.127
Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.

1503
01:57:13.585 --> 01:57:15.295
<i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>

1504
01:57:16.505 --> 01:57:18.120
John Doe has the upper hand.

1505
01:57:18.834 --> 01:57:19.605
Mills!

1506
01:57:20.008 --> 01:57:21.135
Here he comes.

1507
01:57:21.301 --> 01:57:23.178
Throw your gun down!
What?

1508
01:57:23.345 --> 01:57:25.556
I wish I could've lived like you.
Shut up.

1509
01:57:25.722 --> 01:57:28.517
What the fuck you talking about?
Go away!

1510
01:57:28.684 --> 01:57:29.977
Do you hear me, detective?

1511
01:57:30.144 --> 01:57:34.481
I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1512
01:57:35.566 --> 01:57:37.401
What?
Tracy.

1513
01:57:37.568 --> 01:57:38.777
Mills!

1514
01:57:38.944 --> 01:57:40.028
What'd you fucking say?

1515
01:57:40.195 --> 01:57:44.283
It's disturbing how easily a member of
the press can purchase information

1516
01:57:44.449 --> 01:57:46.160
from the men in your precinct.

1517
01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.162
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1518
01:57:48.579 --> 01:57:50.455
<i>Throw your gun down!</i>

1519
01:57:50.622 --> 01:57:52.666
I visited your home this morning.

1520
01:57:53.667 --> 01:57:55.460
After you'd left.

1521
01:57:55.627 --> 01:57:57.754
Mills!
I tried to play husband.

1522
01:57:58.422 --> 01:58:01.675
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.

1523
01:58:01.884 --> 01:58:03.135
Throw it away!

1524
01:58:03.302 --> 01:58:05.596
It didn't work out.

1525
01:58:05.762 --> 01:58:06.831
So...

1526
01:58:07.598 --> 01:58:09.516
I took a souvenir.

1527
01:58:11.143 --> 01:58:12.853
Her pretty head.

1528
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:14.605
Mills.

1529
01:58:15.147 --> 01:58:16.373
Mills.

1530
01:58:17.774 --> 01:58:18.942
What's he talking about?

1531
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:21.486
Give me your gun.
What's going on over there?

1532
01:58:21.653 --> 01:58:22.946
Put the...
Put the gun down.

1533
01:58:23.113 --> 01:58:25.115
I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?

1534
01:58:25.282 --> 01:58:28.202
Because I envy your normal life.
Put the gun down, David.

1535
01:58:28.368 --> 01:58:31.330
It seems that envy is my sin.
Oh, what's in the box?

1536
01:58:31.496 --> 01:58:33.832
Not until you give me the gun.
What's in the fucking box?

1537
01:58:33.845 --> 01:58:34.749
Give me the gun.

1538
01:58:34.763 --> 01:58:35.892
He just told you.

1539
01:58:35.918 --> 01:58:39.546
You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
David.

1540
01:58:39.713 --> 01:58:42.466
That's what he wants.
He wants. He wants you to shoot him.

1541
01:58:42.633 --> 01:58:43.631
No!

1542
01:58:44.145 --> 01:58:45.174
No.

1543
01:58:46.136 --> 01:58:47.930
You tell me, you tell me that's not true.

1544
01:58:48.096 --> 01:58:50.224
That's not true.
Become vengeance, David.

1545
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:52.468
Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
Become...

1546
01:58:53.435 --> 01:58:55.938
wrath.
Tell me she's all right!

1547
01:58:56.104 --> 01:58:58.232
If you murder a suspect, David...
No.

1548
01:58:58.398 --> 01:59:00.158
You throw it all away, he knows it.

1549
01:59:00.317 --> 01:59:01.318
No!

1550
01:59:01.485 --> 01:59:03.487
She begged for her life detective.
Shut up.

1551
01:59:03.654 --> 01:59:08.224
She begged for her life and for
the life of the baby inside of her.

1552
01:59:08.237 --> 01:59:09.237
Shut up!

1553
01:59:26.677 --> 01:59:27.886
He didn't know.

1554
01:59:41.858 --> 01:59:43.419
Give me the gun, David.

1555
01:59:48.782 --> 01:59:49.884
David.

1556
01:59:51.576 --> 01:59:52.995
If you kill him...

1557
01:59:54.496 --> 01:59:56.048
he will win.

1558
01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:01.495
Oh, God.

1559
02:00:01.962 --> 02:00:03.372
Oh, God.

1560
02:00:19.479 --> 02:00:21.231
<i>Oh, fuck, he shot him.</i>

1561
02:00:43.337 --> 02:00:45.522
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>

1562
02:00:47.132 --> 02:00:49.026
<i>Come on, set us down.</i>

1563
02:00:51.845 --> 02:00:55.240
<i>Holy Christ.
Somebody call somebody.</i>

1564
02:00:55.807 --> 02:00:57.442
<i>Call somebody.</i>

1565
02:01:12.115 --> 02:01:14.960
Well, we'll take care of him.

1566
02:01:23.835 --> 02:01:25.579
Whatever he needs.

1567
02:01:26.797 --> 02:01:28.298
Where are you gonna be?

1568
02:01:31.009 --> 02:01:32.186
Around.

1569
02:01:36.723 --> 02:01:38.342
I'll be around.

1570
02:01:42.521 --> 02:01:44.773
<i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote,</i>

1571
02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:49.361
<i>The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for.</i>

1572
02:01:50.195 --> 02:01:52.581
<i>I agree with the second part.</i>
