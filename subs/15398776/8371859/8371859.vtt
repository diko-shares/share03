00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:33.501
-(suspenseful music playing)
-(rain pattering)

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.047
(violent whooshing)

3
00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:55.289
(erupting)

4
00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.126
(disembodied rhythmic stomping)

5
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.194
(music intensifying)

6
00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.233
(stomping intensifying)

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.878
-(stomping stops)
-(exhales)

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.146
(pensive music playing)

9
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.214
GORDON GRAY:
Dr. Oppenheimer.

10
00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.417
Dr. Oppenheimer.

11
00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.353
As we begin, I believe you have

12
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.388
a statement to read
into the record.

13
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.425
Yes, Your Honor.

14
00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.561
WARD EVANS:
We're not judges, Doctor.

15
00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:34.629
ROBERT:
No.

16
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.130
Of course.

17
00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.272
Members of the security board,

18
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.609
the so-called
derogatory information

19
00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:50.545
in your indictment of me
cannot be fairly understood,

20
00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.414
except in the context
of my life and my work.

21
00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.619
SENATE AIDE:
How long did he testify?

22
00:01:57.652 --> 00:01:59.386
Honestly, I forget.

23
00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:02.757
The whole hearing took a month.

24
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.224
An ordeal, hmm?

25
00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.927
Well, I've only
read the transcripts.

26
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.427
(clears throat)

27
00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.230
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

28
00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.498
You weren't there?

29
00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.835
As chairman,
I wasn't allowed to be.

30
00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:16.436
Are they really
going to ask about it?

31
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.573
-It was years ago.
-Four years ago...

32
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:19.641
Five.

33
00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:22.242
Oppenheimer
still divides America.

34
00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.646
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

35
00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.781
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

36
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.650
not to feel that
you're on trial.

37
00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:32.219
Oh, funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

38
00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.855
-Really, Mr. Strauss...
-It's Admiral.

39
00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:36.824
Um, Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

40
00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.359
President Eisenhower has asked
you to be in his cabinet.

41
00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:41.261
Senate really has no choice
but to confirm you.

42
00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.531
And if they bring up
Oppenheimer?

43
00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.933
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

44
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.368
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

45
00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.538
It'll be uncomfortable.
(chuckles awkwardly)

46
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.707
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

47
00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:55.442
(clamoring)

48
00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.347
ROGER ROBB: Why did you leave
the United States?

49
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.853
I, uh... I wanted to study
the new physics.

50
00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:07.421
GRAY:
Was there nowhere here?

51
00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.456
I thought Berkeley
had the leading

52
00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.324
theoretical physics department.

53
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.928
Yes. Once I built it.

54
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.563
But first I had to go to Europe.

55
00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:18.966
I went to Cambridge to study
under Patrick Blackett.

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.602
Were you happier there
than in America?

57
00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.771
-Happier?
-Yes.

58
00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.339
(unsettling music playing)

59
00:03:27.742 --> 00:03:30.745
No. No, I, uh...

60
00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:35.583
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

61
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.418
...emotionally immature...

62
00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:44.726
<i>...troubled by visions</i>
<i>of a hidden universe.</i>

63
00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.226
(soft blast)

64
00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:51.532
(rumbling)

65
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.605
Useless in the lab.

66
00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.239
(glass shattering)

67
00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.746
Christ, Oppenheimer.

68
00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.848
Have you had any sleep?

69
00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.884
Start again.

70
00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:12.419
I need to go
to the lecture, sir.

71
00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.855
Why?

72
00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.790
It's Niels Bohr.

73
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:20.293
BLACKETT:
Damn, completely forgot.

74
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.530
All right. (clears throat)
Let's go.

75
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:26.768
-Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
-(students laughing)

76
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:27.902
You finish coating those plates.

77
00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:29.771
STUDENT 1:
You see them?

78
00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:31.606
(students laughing)

79
00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.310
STUDENT 2:
Don't forget to clean up!

80
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.839
(cabinet door closes)

81
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:12.412
BOHR: <i>Quantum physics</i>
<i>is not a step forward,</i>

82
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.950
it is a new way
to understand reality.

83
00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.554
Einstein's opened the door,
now we are peering through,

84
00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:22.489
seeing a world inside our world.

85
00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:27.929
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

86
00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:32.567
(unsettling music continues)

87
00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:38.338
(rumbling)

88
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.393
-(music fades out)
-(bell tolling)

89
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.900
(indistinct chatter)

90
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.471
Yeah, definitely.

91
00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:12.874
-(panting)
-Are you all right?

92
00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:15.943
Niels, meet
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

93
00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:17.477
BOHR:
What's the "J" stand for?

94
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.479
Nothing, apparently.

95
00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:20.615
You were at my lecture.

96
00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:22.049
You asked
the only good question.

97
00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.818
BLACKETT:
No one's denying his insight.

98
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.920
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

99
00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:27.788
(swallows) I heard
you give the same lecture...

100
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:31.025
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

101
00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.159
Why ask again?

102
00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:33.794
Hadn't liked your answer.

103
00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.898
Did you like it better
yesterday?

104
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:38.199
A lot.

105
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.134
You can lift the stone
without being ready

106
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.536
for the snake that's revealed.

107
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.705
Now it seems you're ready.

108
00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:47.041
-But you don't enjoy the lab?
-(continues panting)

109
00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:49.944
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

110
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.947
Go somewhere they let you think.

111
00:06:53.948 --> 00:06:55.583
(whispers):
Where?

112
00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:57.218
Göttingen.

113
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.186
-Born?
-Born.

114
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.188
Get to Germany,
study under Max Born.

115
00:07:01.222 --> 00:07:03.858
Learn the ways of theory.

116
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.926
I'll send word.

117
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.527
(gasps)

118
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.663
-Wormhole. (exhales)
-(apple clatters in trashcan)

119
00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:10.064
How's your mathematics?

120
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.066
Not good enough for
the physicist he wants to be.

121
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:14.669
Algebra's like sheet music.

122
00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:17.171
The important thing isn't
"Can you read music?"

123
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:18.205
It's "Can you hear it?"

124
00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:21.542
Can you hear the music, Robert?

125
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.078
Yes, I can.

126
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.647
(classical music playing)

127
00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:31.484
-(rumbling)
-(metallic clinking)

128
00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.990
(music intensifying)

129
00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:13.761
(intense classical music
continues)

130
00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:20.901
(rumbling)

131
00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.917
(rumbling)

132
00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:44.058
(music tempo increasing)

133
00:08:58.939 --> 00:08:59.774
(music ends)

134
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.308
The senator from Wyoming.

135
00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:04.745
Admiral Strauss, I'm interested
in your relationship

136
00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:07.648
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

137
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.283
You met him in 1947?

138
00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:10.284
Correct.

139
00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:12.086
You were commissioner

140
00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.687
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

141
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:17.658
I was, but I-I actually
met Robert in my capacity

142
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.361
as board member of the
Institute for Advanced Study

143
00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.196
at Princeton because

144
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:24.865
after the war,
he was world-renowned

145
00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.301
as the great man of physics,
and I was determined

146
00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:30.037
to get him to run the Institute.

147
00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:32.173
(birds chirping)

148
00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.875
(soft music playing)

149
00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:42.283
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

150
00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:43.651
Mr. Strauss.

151
00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:44.985
It's pronounced "straws."

152
00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.354
ROBERT:
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

153
00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:49.256
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

154
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.758
(Strauss chuckles)

155
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.394
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El
in Manhattan.

156
00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.696
"Straws" is just
the Southern pronunciation.

157
00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:56.764
-Ah.
-Anyway,

158
00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.232
welcome to the Institute.

159
00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.900
I think you could be
very happy here.

160
00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:01.869
Yes, well,
you'll love the commute.

161
00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.237
The position comes
with that house

162
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.738
for you and your wife

163
00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:06.941
and your, is it two children?

164
00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:07.775
Yes, two.

165
00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:10.744
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

166
00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:12.980
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

167
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:15.082
I'm sorry, uh,
common room 4:00 tea.

168
00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.885
No, I'm not trained in physics
or anything else.

169
00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:19.753
-I'm a self-made man.
-Ah.

170
00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:21.789
-I can relate to that.
-Really?

171
00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:24.158
Yes, my father was one.

172
00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:27.761
And this would be your office.

173
00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.873
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

174
00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:41.008
You know, I've always wondered

175
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:44.645
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

176
00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:48.916
Greatest scientific mind
of our time.

177
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.818
Of his time.

178
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:52.887
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

179
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.856
more than 40 years ago now.

180
00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:59.360
But never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.

181
00:10:59.393 --> 00:11:00.928
"God doesn't play dice."

182
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.930
Precisely.

183
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.766
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

184
00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:08.169
Well, I had offers,
but I chose to sell shoes.

185
00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:11.705
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

186
00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:14.375
No, just a shoe salesman.

187
00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:16.677
Huh.

188
00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:20.714
-I'd love to introduce you.
-No need.

189
00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.284
I have known him for years.

190
00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:32.259
(soft music continues)

191
00:11:44.506 --> 00:11:46.207
Albert.

192
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.276
(pensive music playing)

193
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:55.015
What was that?
What did you say to him?

194
00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:58.185
Oh, he's fine.

195
00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:03.357
Mr. Strauss,
there are things in my past

196
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.892
you ought to be aware of.

197
00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.827
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

198
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.329
I have access
to your security file.

199
00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.363
I've read it.

200
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.965
-You're not worried?
-No.

201
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:12.366
Why would I be worried
after everything

202
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.867
you've done for your country?

203
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.369
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

204
00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:17.238
Well, the purpose
of this institute

205
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:19.940
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

206
00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:23.877
That's you.
You are the man for the job.

207
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:26.514
Well, then I'll consider it.

208
00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:28.816
I'll see you
at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

209
00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.187
(scoffs)

210
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.788
This is one
of the most prestigious

211
00:12:34.822 --> 00:12:36.558
appointments in the country.

212
00:12:36.591 --> 00:12:38.792
Yes, with a great commute.

213
00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:41.128
That's why I'm considering it.

214
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:42.930
SENATOR McGEE:
<i>So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

215
00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:45.366
<i>your attention</i>
<i>to his past associations</i>

216
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.534
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

217
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:48.002
Yes.

218
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.870
And it didn't concern you?

219
00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.438
Just then,
I was entirely consumed

220
00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:55.242
with what he must have said
to Einstein to sour him on me.

221
00:12:55.276 --> 00:12:57.778
(laughter)

222
00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:00.047
But later?

223
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.016
Well, we all know
what happened later.

224
00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.418
ROBB: Doctor, your, uh...
your time in Europe,

225
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.020
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

226
00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.488
of other countries' physicists.

227
00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:08.523
Yes, that's right.

228
00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:10.824
Any Russians?

229
00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.327
None that spring to mind.

230
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.263
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement...

231
00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:19.266
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

232
00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:24.438
ROBERT: After Göttingen,
I moved on to Leiden in Holland

233
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:27.509
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

234
00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:30.044
(clears throat) Excuse me.

235
00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:31.178
(grunts)

236
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.947
(sighs)

237
00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:36.317
A Yank,
lecturing on the new physics?

238
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.418
This I have to hear.

239
00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:39.486
I'm an American myself.

240
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:41.021
How surprising.

241
00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:42.122
Um...

242
00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.425
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

243
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.862
(scattered laughter)

244
00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:54.101
(speaking Dutch)

245
00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.374
Wait, what's he saying?

246
00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:05.979
(door opens)

247
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.983
(Rabi grunts)

248
00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:11.952
No, thank you.

249
00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:13.954
It's a long way to Zurich.

250
00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.623
You get any skinnier,
we're gonna lose you

251
00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:17.491
between the seat cushions.

252
00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:18.560
I'm Rabi.

253
00:14:18.593 --> 00:14:19.960
Oppenheimer.

254
00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:22.029
I caught your lecture
on molecules.

255
00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:23.197
Caught some of it.

256
00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:26.500
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?

257
00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:28.102
Well, I thought
I'd better learn it

258
00:14:28.135 --> 00:14:29.303
when I got here this semester.

259
00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.938
You learned enough Dutch
in six weeks

260
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:32.674
to give a lecture
on quantum mechanics?

261
00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.208
Wanted to challenge myself.

262
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:36.611
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

263
00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:38.379
<i>-Schvitzer.</i>
<i>-Schvitzer?</i>

264
00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:40.314
-Show-off.
-(chuckles)

265
00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:42.182
Dutch in six weeks,
but you never learned Yiddish?

266
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.284
They don't speak it so much
my side of the park.

267
00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.386
Screw you.

268
00:14:46.487 --> 00:14:47.988
You homesick?

269
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:49.423
Oh, you know it.

270
00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:53.394
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

271
00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:54.495
Physicists?

272
00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.029
'S funny.

273
00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:58.132
Not in the department.

274
00:14:58.165 --> 00:14:59.466
They're all Jewish too.

275
00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:02.970
Eat.

276
00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.408
There's a German
you have to seek out.

277
00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:10.978
-Heisenberg.
-Right.

278
00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.382
(Heisenberg speaking German)

279
00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:21.656
One might be led
to the presumption

280
00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:24.158
that behind the quantum world,

281
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:28.061
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

282
00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:30.297
but such speculation seem to us,

283
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.066
to say it explicitly, fruitless.
Thank you.

284
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.536
Have a great day.

285
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.707
(indistinct chatter)

286
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:41.442
-Wonderful.
-Thank you.

287
00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:42.710
Dr. Oppenheimer.

288
00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:44.679
Oppenheimer, yes.

289
00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:46.581
I liked your paper on molecules.

290
00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:48.115
Probably because
you inspired it.

291
00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:49.651
If I inspire anything else,
let me know.

292
00:15:49.684 --> 00:15:50.718
We could publish together.

293
00:15:50.752 --> 00:15:52.587
I have to get back to America.

294
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.354
Why? There's no one there

295
00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:56.591
taking quantum mechanics
seriously.

296
00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:58.225
-That's exactly why.
-(sighs)

297
00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:00.695
He's pining for the canyons
of Manhattan.

298
00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:03.163
ROBERT:
Canyons of New Mexico.

299
00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:04.331
-You're from New Mexico?
-No.

300
00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:06.467
New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch

301
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.603
outside Santa Fe. (inhales)

302
00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:11.004
That's the America
I miss right now.

303
00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:13.106
Then it's best you get home,
cowboys.

304
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.742
-(Robert chuckles)
-(chuckles) That's him.

305
00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:18.212
No, me and horses.
I don't think so.

306
00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:20.380
-(Rabi chuckles)
-Nice to meet you.

307
00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:24.251
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

308
00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:27.187
Not in person, no, but, uh...

309
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.525
...you might say
our paths crossed.

310
00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:34.294
On returning to America,
I accepted positions

311
00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:37.064
at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

312
00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:39.299
(indistinct chatter)

313
00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:42.402
WOMAN:
I got it, it's all right.

314
00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.539
(mellow music playing)

315
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:03.156
ROBERT:
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

316
00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.793
You must be Oppenheimer.

317
00:17:05.827 --> 00:17:07.361
Yes.

318
00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.731
I hear you want to start
a school of quantum theory.

319
00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:11.431
I am starting it. Next door.

320
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.300
-They put you in there?
-I asked for it.

321
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:15.402
Wanted to be close
to you experimentalists.

322
00:17:15.435 --> 00:17:17.805
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

323
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.807
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

324
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:22.544
-Magnificent.
-Would you like to help?

325
00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:24.411
Build it? Oh, no. (chuckles)

326
00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:25.547
No, no.

327
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.148
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

328
00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:29.182
When do you start teaching?

329
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:31.084
I've got my first in an hour.

330
00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:33.120
-Seminar?
-Pupil.

331
00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:36.390
One student? That's it?

332
00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:39.159
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

333
00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:41.194
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

334
00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:42.697
There's no going back.

335
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.832
(door opens)

336
00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:47.167
-Oh. I must have missed the...
-Ah. Lo...

337
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.202
-Mr. Lomanitz?
-Na.

338
00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:51.305
Yeah.

339
00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:53.440
Yes, this is it. Please.

340
00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:54.542
Take a seat.

341
00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:57.077
(clears throat)

342
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:01.214
What do you know
about quantum mechanics?

343
00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:03.618
I have a grasp on the basics.

344
00:18:03.651 --> 00:18:05.218
Then you're doing it wrong.

345
00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:06.420
(classical music playing)

346
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:08.723
Is light made up
of particles or waves?

347
00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:09.891
Quantum mechanics
says it's both.

348
00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:11.526
How could it be both?

349
00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:13.460
-It can't.
-It can't.

350
00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:18.365
But it is. It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

351
00:18:25.506 --> 00:18:26.507
Now.

352
00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.344
Thank you.

353
00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:33.380
Mr. Lomanitz.
You're gonna be okay.

354
00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:34.782
Mr. Snyder.

355
00:18:34.816 --> 00:18:36.350
Now let's consider a star.

356
00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:39.921
A star. A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

357
00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:43.357
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

358
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.826
Balanced.

359
00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:47.160
But if that furnace cools...

360
00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:48.495
(crackling)

361
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:50.531
...and gravity starts winning,
it contracts.

362
00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.499
Density increases.

363
00:18:52.533 --> 00:18:53.735
Correct.

364
00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:54.936
Increasing gravity.

365
00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:56.470
Increasing density.

366
00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:58.640
-And?
-It's a vicious cycle until...

367
00:18:58.673 --> 00:19:00.307
what's the limit here?

368
00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:03.711
(chuckles) I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

369
00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:05.513
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

370
00:19:05.546 --> 00:19:07.447
Me?

371
00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:09.651
Yes, you.
Your math is better than mine.

372
00:19:09.684 --> 00:19:11.351
(students laughing)

373
00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.487
SENATOR BARTLETT:
<i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

374
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:15.923
<i>contained detail</i>
<i>of his activities in Berkeley.</i>

375
00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:17.424
Why would they have
started a file

376
00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:20.394
on Dr. Oppenheimer
before the war?

377
00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:22.897
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

378
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.799
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

379
00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:27.769
Uh, my assumption is that

380
00:19:27.802 --> 00:19:30.938
it was connected to his, uh,

381
00:19:30.972 --> 00:19:33.508
left-wing political activities.

382
00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:36.276
LAWRENCE: You shouldn't
let them bring up politics

383
00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.645
in the classroom, Oppie.

384
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.413
I wrote that.

385
00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:42.717
Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics.

386
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.552
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

387
00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:46.688
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

388
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:48.321
LAWRENCE:
Well, this is America, Oppie.

389
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.724
We had our revolution.

390
00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:53.360
Seriously,
keep it out of the lab.

391
00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:56.496
Well, out of the lab,
my landlady

392
00:19:56.531 --> 00:19:59.332
is having a discussion group
tonight. Interested?

393
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.435
I have sampled
the Berkeley political scene.

394
00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:03.504
It's all just
philosophy post-grads

395
00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:05.840
and Communists
talking integration.

396
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:07.542
You don't care
about integration.

397
00:20:07.575 --> 00:20:09.443
I want to vote for it,
not talk about it.

398
00:20:09.476 --> 00:20:11.478
'Specially on a Friday.
Come on, let's eat.

399
00:20:11.512 --> 00:20:13.848
(sighs)
I'm meeting my brother there.

400
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.750
SENATOR BARTLETT:
<i>And how would these activities</i>

401
00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:16.918
<i>have come to the attention</i>

402
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:17.952
of the FBI?

403
00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:19.954
Well, if I remember correctly,

404
00:20:19.987 --> 00:20:21.923
the FBI was taking
license plates

405
00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:24.291
outside suspected
Communist gatherings,

406
00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:26.326
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

407
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:35.435
-Gotcha!
-(whispers): Jesus Christ.

408
00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.772
-Sorry. Hi, brother.
-Frank.

409
00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.508
Uh, you remember Jackie.

410
00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:42.009
Evening.

411
00:20:42.043 --> 00:20:44.011
Let's go. Come.

412
00:20:44.045 --> 00:20:46.614
MAN: Right over there,
right over there.

413
00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:50.551
Robert. I want you
to meet Chevalier.

414
00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:54.287
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

415
00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:55.489
-Pleasure.
-Pleasure.

416
00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:56.824
This is my little brother,
Frank.

417
00:20:56.858 --> 00:20:58.059
-And this is...
-Hello.

418
00:20:58.092 --> 00:21:00.027
-Still Jackie.
-Hello, Still Jackie.

419
00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:02.029
Chevalier, you're in languages?

420
00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:03.798
And your reputation
precedes you.

421
00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:05.566
-What have you heard?
-MARY: Excuse me.

422
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.367
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

423
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.636
I have no chance
of understanding,

424
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.037
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

425
00:21:10.071 --> 00:21:12.372
-Uh, I'm not.
-Oh, not yet.

426
00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:14.374
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day,

427
00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:16.043
-I was saying...
-I support a range of causes.

428
00:21:16.077 --> 00:21:17.712
CHEVALIER:
The Spanish Civil War?

429
00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:19.479
A democratic republic
being overthrown

430
00:21:19.514 --> 00:21:20.815
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

431
00:21:20.848 --> 00:21:22.517
Our government.

432
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.018
They think that socialism is
a bigger threat than fascism.

433
00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:25.553
ROBERT:
Not for long.

434
00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.387
Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

435
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.991
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

436
00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:32.059
I have to do something.

437
00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:35.462
(sighs)
My own work is so abstract.

438
00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:37.064
What are you working on?

439
00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:39.033
What happens to the stars
when they die.

440
00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:40.500
Do stars die?

441
00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.004
Well, if they do,

442
00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:44.939
they'd cool, then collapse.

443
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:47.608
In fact, the bigger the star,

444
00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:50.343
<i>-the more violent its demise.</i>
-(explosions)

445
00:21:50.377 --> 00:21:51.913
The gravity gets so concentrated

446
00:21:51.946 --> 00:21:54.916
it swallows everything.

447
00:21:54.949 --> 00:21:55.917
Everything, even light.

448
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.118
Can that really happen?

449
00:21:57.151 --> 00:21:58.953
The math says it can.

450
00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:00.420
If we can get published,

451
00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:02.023
then perhaps one day,
an astronomer finds one.

452
00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:03.791
But right now,
all I have is theory,

453
00:22:03.825 --> 00:22:05.693
which can't impact
people's lives.

454
00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:07.995
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

455
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:09.597
do it through
the Communist Party.

456
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.965
They can get it
to the front lines.

457
00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.400
Mary sent me with these.

458
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:16.904
-I'm Jean.
-Robert.

459
00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:18.438
CHEVALIER:
Haakon Chevalier.

460
00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:20.007
The union meeting at Serber's
last month?

461
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.441
Right, right, yes.

462
00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:22.844
Oh, thank you.

463
00:22:22.877 --> 00:22:25.112
CHEVALIER: Robert here says
he's not a Communist.

464
00:22:25.146 --> 00:22:27.447
Well, then he doesn't know
enough about it.

465
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.851
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i>
all three volumes.

466
00:22:29.884 --> 00:22:31.519
Does that count?

467
00:22:31.552 --> 00:22:33.521
It would make you better read
than most party members.

468
00:22:33.554 --> 00:22:35.857
Turgid stuff.
There's some thinking, um,

469
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.058
"Ownership is theft."

470
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:38.993
-"Property."
-"Property"?

471
00:22:39.026 --> 00:22:40.828
"Property," not "ownership."

472
00:22:40.862 --> 00:22:42.897
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

473
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.600
CHEVALIER:
(chuckles) Well.

474
00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:47.835
It's not about the book.

475
00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:50.872
It's about the ideas.
And you sound uncommitted.

476
00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:52.540
Well, I'm committed
to thinking freely

477
00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:55.009
about how to improve our world.

478
00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:57.144
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

479
00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:00.147
You're a physicist,
you pick and choose rules?

480
00:23:00.181 --> 00:23:01.749
Or do you use the discipline

481
00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:03.918
to channel your energies
into progress?

482
00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:06.354
I like a little wiggle room.

483
00:23:07.454 --> 00:23:09.657
Do you always
tow the party line?

484
00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:12.793
I like my wiggle room too.

485
00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:16.697
(Jean breathing heavily)

486
00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:21.769
(exhales deeply)

487
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:25.472
-ROBERT: What?
-(chuckles)

488
00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:26.674
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:32.179
JEAN:
Unexpected.

490
00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:34.115
-What?
-For a physicist.

491
00:23:34.148 --> 00:23:36.918
You only have a shelf
full of Freud?

492
00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:39.820
Well, actually,
my background's more...

493
00:23:39.854 --> 00:23:41.689
Uh, Jungian?

494
00:23:42.823 --> 00:23:43.925
You know analysis?

495
00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:46.493
When I was in post-grad
at Cambridge,

496
00:23:46.527 --> 00:23:47.828
I had a little trouble.

497
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.565
-I'll bite.
-I tried to poison my tutor.

498
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:52.600
Did you hate him?

499
00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:54.101
I liked him very much.

500
00:23:54.135 --> 00:23:56.037
You just needed to get laid.

501
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.638
Took my analyst two years,

502
00:23:57.672 --> 00:23:59.607
and I don't think they
ever put it that succinctly.

503
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.975
You have everyone convinced

504
00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:03.744
you're more complicated
than you actually are.

505
00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:05.780
We're all simple souls, I guess.

506
00:24:05.813 --> 00:24:06.981
I'm not.

507
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.885
What's this?

508
00:24:10.918 --> 00:24:12.485
Sanskrit.

509
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.821
You can read this?

510
00:24:13.854 --> 00:24:15.656
I'm learning.

511
00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.662
Read this.

512
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:24.732
Well, in this part,

513
00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:26.968
Vishnu reveals
his multi-armed self...

514
00:24:27.001 --> 00:24:28.002
No.

515
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.938
Read the words.

516
00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:37.477
"And now I am become Death.

517
00:24:42.917 --> 00:24:44.652
Destroyer of worlds."

518
00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.088
(thunder rumbling)

519
00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:50.891
(wind howling)

520
00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:54.695
(disquieting music playing)

521
00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:11.545
(thunder rumbling)

522
00:25:15.583 --> 00:25:16.917
This'll do. (clicks tongue)

523
00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:24.658
It'll break before dawn.

524
00:25:24.692 --> 00:25:28.062
Air cools overnight,
just before dawn, it breaks.

525
00:25:30.731 --> 00:25:32.666
(clicks tongue) Come.

526
00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:36.003
(laughter)

527
00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:42.176
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

528
00:25:42.209 --> 00:25:43.811
-Frank. Congratulations!
-Thank you.

529
00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.646
-Thank you.
-To Jackie?

530
00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:48.049
-Yeah, to Jackie.
-(clears throat)

531
00:25:48.082 --> 00:25:49.183
The waitress.

532
00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:51.185
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

533
00:25:51.218 --> 00:25:53.654
I'm gonna go see
if there's any stars.

534
00:25:53.687 --> 00:25:55.723
All your talk
about the common man,

535
00:25:55.756 --> 00:25:57.258
but Jackie's not good enough
for you, hmm?

536
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:58.325
ROBERT:
Mm-mm.

537
00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.860
We join the Party and you can't

538
00:25:59.894 --> 00:26:01.662
-hide your disapproval. Why?
-Oh, now, I...

539
00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:02.763
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

540
00:26:02.797 --> 00:26:04.331
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

541
00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:06.901
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

542
00:26:06.934 --> 00:26:08.669
Half of the faculty
is Communist.

543
00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:09.770
Not that half.

544
00:26:11.105 --> 00:26:13.841
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

545
00:26:13.874 --> 00:26:15.576
And I want to wring your neck.

546
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.945
(breath shudders)

547
00:26:17.978 --> 00:26:20.881
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

548
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.087
You're happy, I'm happy.

549
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.655
So then I'm happy you're happy

550
00:26:27.688 --> 00:26:29.023
-that I'm happy.
-(chuckles)

551
00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:33.260
(mysterious music playing)

552
00:26:33.294 --> 00:26:34.895
LAWRENCE:
I feel like I could see

553
00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:37.031
one of those dark stars
that you're working on.

554
00:26:37.064 --> 00:26:39.633
You can't.
That's the whole point.

555
00:26:40.301 --> 00:26:42.002
Their gravity swallows light.

556
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.340
It's like a kind of
hole in space.

557
00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:47.708
Is Frank okay?

558
00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:50.144
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

559
00:26:51.278 --> 00:26:52.947
It is special here.

560
00:26:55.316 --> 00:26:57.785
When I was a kid,

561
00:26:57.818 --> 00:27:00.855
I thought if I could find a way

562
00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:05.259
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

563
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:07.828
my life would be perfect.
(laughs)

564
00:27:08.896 --> 00:27:10.164
Little remote for that.

565
00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:11.332
Yes.

566
00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.033
Let's get some sleep.

567
00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:15.402
ROBERT:
That mesa we saw today,

568
00:27:15.436 --> 00:27:17.938
one of my favorite places
in the world.

569
00:27:18.772 --> 00:27:20.241
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

570
00:27:20.274 --> 00:27:21.709
LAWRENCE:
What's it called?

571
00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:24.812
ROBERT:
Los Alamos.

572
00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:29.917
I didn't expect
to see you today.

573
00:27:31.085 --> 00:27:32.920
Do I have to make
an appointment?

574
00:27:34.855 --> 00:27:36.991
BARBER:
Hey! Hey, get back here!

575
00:27:37.024 --> 00:27:38.159
Alvarez?

576
00:27:43.931 --> 00:27:46.767
ALVAREZ:
Oppie! Oppie!

577
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.802
ROBERT:
What? What is it?

578
00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:50.437
They've done it.
They've done it.

579
00:27:50.471 --> 00:27:51.739
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

580
00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:53.941
They split the uranium nucleus.

581
00:27:54.808 --> 00:27:56.677
LAWRENCE:
How?

582
00:27:57.411 --> 00:27:59.313
Bombard it with neutrons.

583
00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:00.481
ALVAREZ:
It's a nuclear fission.

584
00:28:00.515 --> 00:28:02.149
They did it,
they split the atom.

585
00:28:02.183 --> 00:28:03.751
It's not possible.

586
00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:06.086
(stimulating music playing)

587
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.692
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

588
00:28:18.332 --> 00:28:20.267
See? Can't be done.

589
00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:24.772
LAWRENCE:
Very elegant. Quite clear.

590
00:28:24.805 --> 00:28:27.441
-There's just one problem.
-Where?

591
00:28:27.474 --> 00:28:29.276
Next door.

592
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.245
Alvarez did it.

593
00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:33.414
-But then look...
-(pulsing)

594
00:28:33.447 --> 00:28:36.784
...these fission pulses,
they're massive.

595
00:28:36.817 --> 00:28:40.087
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

596
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.957
Theory will take you
only so far.

597
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.425
(gasps)

598
00:28:44.458 --> 00:28:46.460
During the process...

599
00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:48.229
extra neutrons boil off,

600
00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:51.432
which could be used to split
other uranium atoms.

601
00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:52.866
Chain reaction.

602
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.536
You're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'.

603
00:28:54.569 --> 00:28:57.338
You, me, and every other
physicist around the world

604
00:28:57.371 --> 00:28:58.872
who's seen the news.

605
00:28:59.574 --> 00:29:01.375
I'm... what?
What are we all thinking?

606
00:29:01.408 --> 00:29:05.179
A bomb, Alvarez.

607
00:29:06.347 --> 00:29:08.048
A bomb.

608
00:29:08.082 --> 00:29:11.285
I told you, Robert,
no more fucking flowers.

609
00:29:12.886 --> 00:29:14.421
I don't understand
what you want from me.

610
00:29:14.455 --> 00:29:16.223
I don't want anything from you.

611
00:29:17.224 --> 00:29:19.260
Well, you say that
and then you call.

612
00:29:19.293 --> 00:29:21.895
Well, don't answer.

613
00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:23.931
I'll always answer.

614
00:29:29.203 --> 00:29:30.137
Fine.

615
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.873
Just no more flowers.
(breathing heavily)

616
00:29:33.907 --> 00:29:35.276
You're not coming?

617
00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:39.246
CHEVALIER: You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

618
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:43.284
It's not that simple, Hoke.

619
00:29:43.317 --> 00:29:45.486
MAN: Chevalier,
good to see you. It's...

620
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.854
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

621
00:29:46.887 --> 00:29:49.356
and the illustrious
Dr. Oppenheimer.

622
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.558
I'm Eltenton.

623
00:29:50.592 --> 00:29:51.959
-ROBERT: Oh, pleasure.
-Please, please.

624
00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:53.160
Now, might you say a word

625
00:29:53.193 --> 00:29:55.929
about organized labor
on campuses, yes?

626
00:29:55.963 --> 00:29:57.498
Coming through! Coming through!

627
00:29:57.532 --> 00:29:59.099
-(chanting): F.A.E.C.T.!
-I work at Shell.

628
00:29:59.133 --> 00:30:01.135
We've signed up chemists,
we've signed up engineers,

629
00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:03.037
so why not scientists
in academia?

630
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.973
(chanting):
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

631
00:30:06.006 --> 00:30:09.276
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

632
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.944
Oppie! Oppie!

633
00:30:10.978 --> 00:30:13.881
-Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
-(cheers and applause)

634
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:21.021
Teachers are unionized.
Why not professors?

635
00:30:21.055 --> 00:30:22.489
Don't you have somewhere to be?

636
00:30:22.524 --> 00:30:24.358
Lawrence,
academics have rights too.

637
00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:26.894
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

638
00:30:26.927 --> 00:30:30.130
-Well, I'll sit in.
-Not this one.

639
00:30:32.433 --> 00:30:33.834
(door opens)

640
00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:38.072
ROBERT:
Richard. Dr. Bush.

641
00:30:38.105 --> 00:30:40.174
What brings you two up north?

642
00:30:42.276 --> 00:30:44.345
(somber music playing)

643
00:30:46.648 --> 00:30:48.015
(sighs)

644
00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:51.018
Richard, you tell Ruth

645
00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:52.319
I'll be down
to Pasadena Thursday.

646
00:30:58.125 --> 00:30:59.226
(sighs)

647
00:31:01.328 --> 00:31:03.964
STUDENT 1: Your paper
on black holes is in!

648
00:31:03.997 --> 00:31:05.966
-STUDENT 2: Oppie!
-(applause)

649
00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:09.637
Where's Hartland?
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

650
00:31:09.671 --> 00:31:11.939
LOMANITZ:
September 1st, 1939,

651
00:31:11.972 --> 00:31:14.208
the world's gonna
remember this day.

652
00:31:14.241 --> 00:31:15.109
(Robert chuckles)

653
00:31:15.142 --> 00:31:16.611
Oh, Hartland.
Our paper, it's in print.

654
00:31:16.644 --> 00:31:19.380
SNYDER:
You've been upstaged.

655
00:31:22.983 --> 00:31:25.520
During the Battle of Britain,
I found myself

656
00:31:25.553 --> 00:31:28.288
increasingly out of sympathy
with the (clears throat)

657
00:31:28.322 --> 00:31:31.325
policy of neutrality
that Communists advocated.

658
00:31:31.358 --> 00:31:35.162
Right after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

659
00:31:35.195 --> 00:31:37.231
these Communist sympathies,
did they return?

660
00:31:37.264 --> 00:31:38.298
No.

661
00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:43.036
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

662
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.304
did not mean a sharp break

663
00:31:44.338 --> 00:31:46.407
from those who held
different views.

664
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.009
For a year or two,
and during a previous marriage,

665
00:31:49.042 --> 00:31:52.346
my wife Kitty had been
a Communist Party member.

666
00:31:53.347 --> 00:31:54.948
(Kitty laughing)

667
00:31:54.982 --> 00:31:56.316
KITTY:
Oop!

668
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.152
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

669
00:31:58.185 --> 00:32:00.187
Well, I thought
this was the Tolmans' house.

670
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.423
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

671
00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:03.957
Do you two need anything?

672
00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:05.459
ROBERT:
We're good, Ruthie.

673
00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:09.196
So, you're a biologist.

674
00:32:09.229 --> 00:32:12.433
Well, somehow
I have graduated to housewife.

675
00:32:12.466 --> 00:32:15.603
Can you explain
quantum mechanics to me?

676
00:32:15.637 --> 00:32:16.671
Seems baffling.

677
00:32:16.704 --> 00:32:18.405
Yes, it is.

678
00:32:19.507 --> 00:32:22.309
Well, this glass,

679
00:32:22.342 --> 00:32:23.243
this drink...

680
00:32:23.277 --> 00:32:26.380
-(knocks countertop)
-...this countertop,

681
00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:29.517
uh, our bodies...

682
00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:31.452
all of it.

683
00:32:31.485 --> 00:32:34.054
It's mostly empty space.

684
00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:36.591
Groupings of tiny energy waves
bound together.

685
00:32:36.624 --> 00:32:38.492
By what?

686
00:32:38.526 --> 00:32:42.095
Forces of attraction
strong enough to convince us

687
00:32:42.129 --> 00:32:44.331
that matter is solid.

688
00:32:44.364 --> 00:32:47.501
Stop my body
passing through yours.

689
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.075
(indistinct chatter)

690
00:32:59.246 --> 00:33:00.748
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

691
00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:02.517
Not very.

692
00:33:04.552 --> 00:33:08.255
There is someone that I feel...

693
00:33:08.288 --> 00:33:09.724
Does she feel the same way?

694
00:33:09.757 --> 00:33:13.595
Sometimes. Not enough.

695
00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:17.765
You know,
I'm going to New Mexico.

696
00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.601
To my ranch, with friends.

697
00:33:19.634 --> 00:33:21.001
You should come.

698
00:33:21.803 --> 00:33:23.638
I meant with your husband.

699
00:33:23.671 --> 00:33:25.239
Yes, you did.

700
00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:28.175
'Cause you know it won't make
a bit of difference.

701
00:33:28.208 --> 00:33:30.410
(sentimental music playing)

702
00:33:32.145 --> 00:33:33.648
Why did you marry him?

703
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:37.217
I was lost and he was kind.

704
00:33:39.386 --> 00:33:40.254
Lost?

705
00:33:40.287 --> 00:33:43.791
Well, my previous husband
had died, and...

706
00:33:43.825 --> 00:33:46.260
at 28, I wasn't really ready
to be a widow.

707
00:33:46.293 --> 00:33:48.295
-Who was your first husband?
-Nobody.

708
00:33:48.328 --> 00:33:50.798
But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

709
00:33:50.832 --> 00:33:53.801
He was, um, from money,
like me, but...

710
00:33:53.835 --> 00:33:56.771
he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

711
00:33:56.804 --> 00:33:58.071
Fell hard.

712
00:33:58.105 --> 00:33:59.373
(chuckles) How hard?

713
00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:01.074
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

714
00:34:01.108 --> 00:34:02.442
living off beans and pancakes,

715
00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:05.245
handing out the <i>Daily Worker</i>
at factory gates.

716
00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:07.782
By 36, I just told Joe
I couldn't take it anymore.

717
00:34:07.815 --> 00:34:09.684
Quit the Party and a year later,

718
00:34:09.717 --> 00:34:13.253
I wanted him back, so...
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

719
00:34:13.287 --> 00:34:15.422
And he said, "Swell, I'll meet
you on my way to Spain."

720
00:34:15.455 --> 00:34:17.157
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

721
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.293
And then he went to
the brigades and I waited.

722
00:34:19.326 --> 00:34:20.394
And...

723
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:22.630
Joe got himself killed

724
00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:25.065
first time he popped his head
out of the trench.

725
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.836
Ideology got Joe killed.
For nothing.

726
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.738
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

727
00:34:30.772 --> 00:34:31.873
My husband offered
both our futures

728
00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:33.373
to stop one fascist bullet

729
00:34:33.407 --> 00:34:35.577
from embedding itself
in a mudbank.

730
00:34:36.476 --> 00:34:38.312
That's the definition
of nothing.

731
00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:40.347
Seems a little reductive.

732
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.115
Pragmatic.

733
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:44.586
Now here I am.

734
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:48.422
Wherever the hell this is.

735
00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:52.627
(sentimental music continues)

736
00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:58.733
I didn't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

737
00:34:58.766 --> 00:35:01.134
(crying softly)

738
00:35:01.168 --> 00:35:04.505
Least you didn't
bring me flowers. (sniffles)

739
00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:07.742
(chuckles)

740
00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:09.611
(tender music playing)

741
00:35:09.644 --> 00:35:13.213
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

742
00:35:14.247 --> 00:35:16.884
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

743
00:35:16.918 --> 00:35:18.318
No.

744
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:22.255
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

745
00:35:23.457 --> 00:35:25.192
You knocked her up, fast work.

746
00:35:25.225 --> 00:35:27.862
-Can't keep a good man down.
-(scoffs)

747
00:35:27.895 --> 00:35:29.897
I meant her.

748
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:31.933
She knew what she wanted.

749
00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:33.901
What about the husband?

750
00:35:33.935 --> 00:35:35.402
We talked, um,

751
00:35:35.435 --> 00:35:37.371
they're getting a divorce, so...

752
00:35:37.404 --> 00:35:41.174
we can get married
before she starts showing.

753
00:35:41.208 --> 00:35:42.677
How civilized.

754
00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:45.747
You idiot.

755
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.548
This is your community.

756
00:35:47.582 --> 00:35:50.518
You think the rules
don't apply to the golden boy?

757
00:35:51.686 --> 00:35:53.320
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

758
00:35:53.353 --> 00:35:55.857
Don't alienate the only people
in the world

759
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.558
that understand what you do.

760
00:35:59.292 --> 00:36:00.662
One day you might need them.

761
00:36:00.695 --> 00:36:03.430
F.A.E.C.T. MEMBERS (chanting):
F.A.E.C.T.!

762
00:36:03.463 --> 00:36:04.666
ROBERT:
The Federation of Architects,

763
00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:07.835
Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians.

764
00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:09.369
(chanting stops)

765
00:36:14.274 --> 00:36:16.811
Lomanitz,
what do you get paid a month?

766
00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:17.979
That's not the point, Lawrence.

767
00:36:18.012 --> 00:36:20.313
What do any of you
have in common

768
00:36:20.347 --> 00:36:22.950
with farm laborers
and dock workers?

769
00:36:22.984 --> 00:36:24.552
LOMANITZ:
Plenty.

770
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.156
Everybody out. Now!

771
00:36:31.993 --> 00:36:33.393
Not you.

772
00:36:36.263 --> 00:36:39.299
(door closes)

773
00:36:39.332 --> 00:36:40.300
What are you doing?

774
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.003
It's a trade union.

775
00:36:42.036 --> 00:36:43.971
Filled with Communists.

776
00:36:44.005 --> 00:36:45.707
So? I haven't joined the Party.

777
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.842
They won't let me
bring you onto the project

778
00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:49.577
because of this shit.

779
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.378
They won't even let me
tell you what the project is.

780
00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:53.848
Oh. (scoffs)
I know what the project is.

781
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:54.949
Oh, really?

782
00:36:54.982 --> 00:36:56.283
We've all heard about Einstein

783
00:36:56.316 --> 00:36:57.585
and Szilard's letter
to Roosevelt

784
00:36:57.618 --> 00:36:59.419
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

785
00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:02.322
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

786
00:37:02.355 --> 00:37:03.725
Oh, and I don't?

787
00:37:03.758 --> 00:37:06.393
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

788
00:37:07.494 --> 00:37:08.495
It's mine.

789
00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:11.666
You think that I tell them
about your politics.

790
00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:15.335
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

791
00:37:15.368 --> 00:37:17.404
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

792
00:37:17.437 --> 00:37:19.507
Listen to the sounds
on your phone line

793
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.610
and stop being so goddamn naive.

794
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:25.445
Why would they care what I do?

795
00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:27.447
(scoffs) Because you're
not just self-important,

796
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:29.650
you're actually important.

797
00:37:30.885 --> 00:37:32.252
Okay.

798
00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:35.890
Okay. I get it.

799
00:37:35.923 --> 00:37:37.992
If you could
just be a little more...

800
00:37:38.025 --> 00:37:39.527
Pragmatic.

801
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.661
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others,

802
00:37:40.695 --> 00:37:42.797
you don't have to worry.
It's done.

803
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.599
Lawrence.

804
00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:51.438
Then welcome to the war.

805
00:37:51.471 --> 00:37:53.775
ROBERT: I filled out my first
security questionnaire

806
00:37:53.808 --> 00:37:55.076
and was informed

807
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:56.911
that my involvement
with left-wing groups

808
00:37:56.944 --> 00:38:00.882
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

809
00:38:00.915 --> 00:38:03.651
SENATOR PASTORE: <i>Why were</i>
<i>his Communist associations</i>

810
00:38:03.684 --> 00:38:06.788
not seen as a security risk
during the war?

811
00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:08.556
Senator, I can't possibly answer

812
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:11.926
for security clearance granted
years before I ever met the man.

813
00:38:11.959 --> 00:38:13.961
Fine. What about after?

814
00:38:13.995 --> 00:38:15.930
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

815
00:38:15.963 --> 00:38:19.734
was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

816
00:38:19.767 --> 00:38:21.803
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute,

817
00:38:21.836 --> 00:38:24.939
that's why he advised
the Atomic Energy Commission.

818
00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:26.040
Simple as that.

819
00:38:26.073 --> 00:38:28.676
What are they accusing me of?

820
00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:30.477
I think they just want
to know what happened

821
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:33.014
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

822
00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:35.082
on Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

823
00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:37.852
I didn't.
I was chair of the AEC,

824
00:38:37.885 --> 00:38:41.454
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

825
00:38:41.488 --> 00:38:42.723
-Who did?
-Some former staff member

826
00:38:42.757 --> 00:38:44.692
of the Joint
Congressional Committee.

827
00:38:44.725 --> 00:38:47.795
He was a rabid anti-Communist
named Borden.

828
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:50.131
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

829
00:38:50.164 --> 00:38:52.700
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC, direct?

830
00:38:52.733 --> 00:38:55.435
Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?

831
00:38:55.468 --> 00:38:57.905
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

832
00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:59.774
This was the McCarthy Era.

833
00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:04.712
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red. And then,

834
00:39:04.745 --> 00:39:06.413
<i>reading Oppenheimer's</i>
<i>security file,</i>

835
00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:08.616
<i>his Communist brother,</i>
<i>sister-in-law,</i>

836
00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.718
<i>fiancée, best friend, wife.</i>

837
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:13.087
That's before we even
get to the Chevalier incident.

838
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.858
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

839
00:39:16.891 --> 00:39:18.559
Because somebody gave it to him.

840
00:39:19.727 --> 00:39:22.395
Somebody who wanted
Robert silenced.

841
00:39:22.429 --> 00:39:24.031
-Who?
-Who knows?

842
00:39:24.065 --> 00:39:26.601
Robert didn't take care
not to upset

843
00:39:26.634 --> 00:39:28.870
the power brokers in Washington.

844
00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:31.772
His opinions on the atom
became definitive

845
00:39:31.806 --> 00:39:34.709
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

846
00:39:34.742 --> 00:39:35.910
(chuckles softly)

847
00:39:38.112 --> 00:39:40.548
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

848
00:39:40.581 --> 00:39:43.751
There was an AEC vote

849
00:39:43.784 --> 00:39:45.753
on the export of isotopes
to Norway,

850
00:39:45.786 --> 00:39:48.756
<i>and they drafted in Robert</i>
<i>to make me look like a fool.</i>

851
00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:50.490
CONGRESSMAN:
But, Dr. Oppenheimer,

852
00:39:50.524 --> 00:39:52.627
we've already heard
from Admiral Strauss that

853
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.495
these isotopes could be
useful to our enemies

854
00:39:55.529 --> 00:39:56.831
in the production
of atomic weapons.

855
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:58.733
ROBERT: Congressmen,
you could use a shovel

856
00:39:58.766 --> 00:40:00.201
-in making atomic weapons.
-(laughter)

857
00:40:00.234 --> 00:40:01.434
In fact, you do.

858
00:40:01.468 --> 00:40:03.004
You could use a bottle of beer

859
00:40:03.037 --> 00:40:04.437
in making atomic weapons.

860
00:40:04.471 --> 00:40:05.940
In fact, you do.

861
00:40:05.973 --> 00:40:08.910
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components

862
00:40:08.943 --> 00:40:11.712
but more useful than a sandwich.

863
00:40:11.746 --> 00:40:13.514
(all laughing)

864
00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:16.817
STRAUSS: <i>Genius is</i>
<i>no guarantee of wisdom.</i>

865
00:40:17.818 --> 00:40:20.588
How could this man
who saw so much be so blind?

866
00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:24.926
(baby crying)

867
00:40:30.097 --> 00:40:31.532
Kitty?

868
00:40:36.237 --> 00:40:38.172
Kitty?

869
00:40:38.205 --> 00:40:41.609
Kitty, the project...

870
00:40:42.576 --> 00:40:45.179
I'm in. I'm in.

871
00:40:45.212 --> 00:40:46.981
Let's celebrate. (sighs)

872
00:40:49.283 --> 00:40:51.218
(baby continues crying)

873
00:40:51.252 --> 00:40:52.586
(Kitty moans)

874
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.221
Shouldn't you go to him?

875
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:55.690
(uneasy music playing)

876
00:40:58.826 --> 00:41:01.996
I have been going to him
all fucking day.

877
00:41:11.138 --> 00:41:12.807
(baby crying)

878
00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:19.013
(shushing)

879
00:41:19.046 --> 00:41:20.480
(knock at door)

880
00:41:25.753 --> 00:41:27.487
BARBARA:
Come here, darling.

881
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:30.157
I don't know how to say this.

882
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:32.893
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

883
00:41:32.927 --> 00:41:34.862
CHEVALIER:
Anything.

884
00:41:34.895 --> 00:41:35.696
Take Peter.

885
00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.766
-Sure.
-No, for-for a while, Hoke.

886
00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:40.768
A while.

887
00:41:42.336 --> 00:41:44.138
Does Kitty know you're here?

888
00:41:44.171 --> 00:41:45.906
Yes, of course she knows.

889
00:41:46.774 --> 00:41:48.776
Of course she knows. (sighs)

890
00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:52.513
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

891
00:41:54.015 --> 00:41:55.016
Forget I asked.

892
00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:56.884
Selfish, awful people,

893
00:41:56.917 --> 00:41:59.320
they don't know
they're selfish and awful.

894
00:41:59.353 --> 00:42:01.922
Sit, sit, sit.

895
00:42:02.957 --> 00:42:07.061
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

896
00:42:08.763 --> 00:42:11.332
There is a price
to be paid for that.

897
00:42:11.365 --> 00:42:12.933
Of course we'll help you.

898
00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:16.771
(wistful music playing)

899
00:42:23.878 --> 00:42:26.047
KITTY:
Everything's changing, Robert.

900
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.049
Having a child was always
going to change...

901
00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:32.186
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

902
00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:34.622
It's reforming.

903
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.092
This is your moment.

904
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.928
We're putting together a group
to study feasibility...

905
00:42:40.961 --> 00:42:43.764
"We" shouldn't be
doing anything. You should.

906
00:42:44.665 --> 00:42:46.801
Lawrence won't get this done.

907
00:42:46.834 --> 00:42:48.969
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

908
00:42:52.206 --> 00:42:53.841
(indistinct chatter)

909
00:42:57.812 --> 00:42:59.947
ROBERT:
Who are the uniforms?

910
00:43:00.748 --> 00:43:02.650
I thought you might know.

911
00:43:03.684 --> 00:43:05.953
-(door opens)
-MAN: Dr. Oppenheimer.

912
00:43:05.986 --> 00:43:07.955
I'm Colonel Groves.

913
00:43:07.988 --> 00:43:10.224
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

914
00:43:10.257 --> 00:43:11.759
Have that dry-cleaned.

915
00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:17.631
(door opens, closes)

916
00:43:17.665 --> 00:43:19.733
Well, if that's how you treat
Lieutenant Colonel,

917
00:43:19.767 --> 00:43:23.137
I'd hate to see how you treat
a humble physicist.

918
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.239
Ah, if I ever meet one,
I'll let you know.

919
00:43:25.272 --> 00:43:26.774
(chuckles softly) Ouch.

920
00:43:26.807 --> 00:43:28.375
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

921
00:43:28.409 --> 00:43:30.344
but I have to stay
in Washington.

922
00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:33.080
-Why?
-I built the Pentagon.

923
00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:35.749
The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

924
00:43:35.783 --> 00:43:37.918
the Manhattan Engineer District.

925
00:43:37.952 --> 00:43:39.086
Which is?

926
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.389
Oh, don't be a smart ass.
You know damn well what it is.

927
00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:44.125
You and half of every
physics department

928
00:43:44.158 --> 00:43:46.994
across the country.
That's problem number one.

929
00:43:47.027 --> 00:43:48.762
I thought problem
number one would be

930
00:43:48.796 --> 00:43:50.064
securing enough uranium ore.

931
00:43:50.097 --> 00:43:53.200
1,200 tons bought
the day I took charge.

932
00:43:53.234 --> 00:43:54.401
Processing?

933
00:43:54.435 --> 00:43:56.637
Just broke ground
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

934
00:43:57.438 --> 00:43:59.140
Now I'm looking
for a project director.

935
00:43:59.173 --> 00:44:01.275
And my name came up?

936
00:44:01.308 --> 00:44:02.376
Nope.

937
00:44:03.512 --> 00:44:05.746
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

938
00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:07.148
Which made me curious.

939
00:44:07.181 --> 00:44:09.049
What have you found out?

940
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.453
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

941
00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:13.821
a suspected Communist...

942
00:44:13.854 --> 00:44:15.256
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

943
00:44:15.289 --> 00:44:16.891
I said "suspected."

944
00:44:16.924 --> 00:44:21.162
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

945
00:44:21.195 --> 00:44:22.229
Nothing good, no?

946
00:44:22.263 --> 00:44:23.931
Not even
"he's brilliant, but..."

947
00:44:23.964 --> 00:44:25.766
Well, brilliance is taken
for granted

948
00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:27.301
in your circle, so no.

949
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:29.303
No, the only person who had
anything good to say

950
00:44:29.336 --> 00:44:31.071
was Richard Tolman.

951
00:44:31.105 --> 00:44:33.207
Tolman thinks
you have integrity,

952
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.376
but he also strikes me as a guy

953
00:44:35.409 --> 00:44:37.778
who knows more about
science than people.

954
00:44:37.811 --> 00:44:41.782
Yet here you are.
You don't take much on trust.

955
00:44:41.815 --> 00:44:43.817
I don't take anything on trust.

956
00:44:47.388 --> 00:44:49.123
Why don't you
have a Nobel Prize?

957
00:44:49.156 --> 00:44:50.224
Why aren't you a general?

958
00:44:50.257 --> 00:44:51.425
They're making me one for this.

959
00:44:51.458 --> 00:44:52.826
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

960
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.461
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

961
00:44:54.495 --> 00:44:56.830
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

962
00:44:59.266 --> 00:45:00.901
So how would you proceed?

963
00:45:02.403 --> 00:45:05.105
You're talking
about turning theory

964
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.308
into a practical weapons system

965
00:45:07.341 --> 00:45:08.475
faster than the Nazis.

966
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.244
Who have a 12-month head start.

967
00:45:10.277 --> 00:45:11.412
Eighteen.

968
00:45:11.445 --> 00:45:12.813
How could you possibly
know that?

969
00:45:12.846 --> 00:45:14.882
Our fast neutron research
took six months.

970
00:45:14.915 --> 00:45:16.417
The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

971
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.851
will have made
that leap instantly.

972
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:19.086
Who do you think
they put in charge?

973
00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:20.221
Werner Heisenberg.

974
00:45:20.254 --> 00:45:22.823
He has the most intuitive
understanding

975
00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:24.526
of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

976
00:45:24.559 --> 00:45:26.260
-You know his work?
-I know him.

977
00:45:26.293 --> 00:45:28.128
<i>Just like I know Walther Bothe,</i>
<i>von Weizsäcker, Diebner.</i>

978
00:45:28.162 --> 00:45:30.965
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

979
00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:33.734
-We've got one hope.
-Which is?

980
00:45:34.335 --> 00:45:35.970
Anti-Semitism.

981
00:45:37.104 --> 00:45:38.105
What?

982
00:45:38.138 --> 00:45:40.975
Hitler called quantum physics
"Jewish science."

983
00:45:41.008 --> 00:45:42.843
Said it right
to Einstein's face.

984
00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:46.113
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

985
00:45:46.146 --> 00:45:47.948
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

986
00:45:47.982 --> 00:45:49.917
because it'll take
vast resources.

987
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.485
Our nation's best scientists
working together.

988
00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:52.920
Right now, they're scattered.

989
00:45:52.953 --> 00:45:54.556
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

990
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:56.457
All minds have
to see the whole task

991
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.858
to contribute efficiently.

992
00:45:57.891 --> 00:46:00.127
Poor security
may cost us the race.

993
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.996
Inefficiency will.

994
00:46:02.029 --> 00:46:03.864
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

995
00:46:03.897 --> 00:46:06.000
The Russians don't.

996
00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:09.970
Remind me,
who are we at war with?

997
00:46:10.004 --> 00:46:12.439
Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

998
00:46:12.473 --> 00:46:14.074
downplaying the importance

999
00:46:14.108 --> 00:46:16.844
of security from
our Communist allies.

1000
00:46:16.877 --> 00:46:19.547
Point taken. But, no.

1001
00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:21.882
(scoffs) You don't get
to say "no" to me.

1002
00:46:21.915 --> 00:46:24.184
It's my job to say "no" to you
when you're wrong.

1003
00:46:24.218 --> 00:46:26.220
So you have the job now?

1004
00:46:26.253 --> 00:46:28.322
Uh, I'm considering it.

1005
00:46:31.025 --> 00:46:33.360
I'm starting to see
where you got your reputation.

1006
00:46:34.562 --> 00:46:36.997
My favorite response,

1007
00:46:37.031 --> 00:46:39.366
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

1008
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.302
(chuckles)

1009
00:46:41.335 --> 00:46:42.136
I couldn't.

1010
00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:46.340
But I can run
the Manhattan Project.

1011
00:46:47.207 --> 00:46:49.376
There's a way
to balance these things.

1012
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:53.615
Keep the Rad Lab here
at Berkeley under Lawrence.

1013
00:46:53.648 --> 00:46:55.916
Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

1014
00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:58.385
Large-scale refining,
where did you say? Tennessee.

1015
00:46:58.419 --> 00:47:00.087
-And Hanford.
-And Hanford.

1016
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.191
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

1017
00:47:04.224 --> 00:47:05.593
connected by rail.

1018
00:47:05.627 --> 00:47:07.294
Focused on one goal.

1019
00:47:07.328 --> 00:47:10.030
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

1020
00:47:10.064 --> 00:47:12.366
<i>A secret laboratory.</i>
<i>In the middle of nowhere,</i>

1021
00:47:12.399 --> 00:47:13.867
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

1022
00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:15.269
equipment, housing, the works.

1023
00:47:15.302 --> 00:47:17.471
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

1024
00:47:17.505 --> 00:47:19.541
It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

1025
00:47:19.574 --> 00:47:21.008
Why?

1026
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:22.343
ROBERT:
<i>If we don't let scientists</i>

1027
00:47:22.376 --> 00:47:24.078
bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

1028
00:47:24.111 --> 00:47:26.180
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

1029
00:47:26.213 --> 00:47:27.281
Where?

1030
00:47:31.285 --> 00:47:33.253
Welcome to Los Alamos.

1031
00:47:33.287 --> 00:47:36.090
Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

1032
00:47:36.123 --> 00:47:38.092
and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

1033
00:47:38.125 --> 00:47:41.362
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

1034
00:47:41.395 --> 00:47:43.330
Enough to find the perfect spot.

1035
00:47:43.364 --> 00:47:45.866
-For?
-Success.

1036
00:47:47.334 --> 00:47:49.403
(gripping music playing)

1037
00:47:51.138 --> 00:47:53.140
Build him a town. Fast.

1038
00:47:54.174 --> 00:47:56.678
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

1039
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:59.046
Why would I leave my family?

1040
00:47:59.079 --> 00:48:00.515
I told you,
you can bring your family.

1041
00:48:00.548 --> 00:48:01.982
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

1042
00:48:02.015 --> 00:48:04.118
A soldier? He's a general.

1043
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:05.986
I've got all the soldier I need.

1044
00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:07.589
What can I tell them?

1045
00:48:07.622 --> 00:48:09.957
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

1046
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.291
What do these men
have in common?

1047
00:48:11.325 --> 00:48:13.327
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

1048
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.696
-Yes, and?
-Uh...

1049
00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:17.998
As much as you like,

1050
00:48:18.031 --> 00:48:20.167
until you feel my boot
on your balls.

1051
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.970
You know isotopes
and you know explosives

1052
00:48:23.003 --> 00:48:24.304
better than anyone in the world.

1053
00:48:24.338 --> 00:48:26.940
But you can't tell us
what you're doing?

1054
00:48:26.974 --> 00:48:28.242
(Groves sighs)

1055
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.246
-I don't know.
-The Nazis have them.

1056
00:48:32.279 --> 00:48:34.415
-Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
-Under Nazi occupation.

1057
00:48:34.448 --> 00:48:36.316
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

1058
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.686
Why would we go
to the middle of nowhere

1059
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.187
for who knows how long?
(chuckling)

1060
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.322
For a year or two. Or three.

1061
00:48:43.323 --> 00:48:46.927
Uh, General, could you
give us a moment?

1062
00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:51.064
It's about unleashing
the strong force...

1063
00:48:52.199 --> 00:48:53.601
...before the Nazis do.

1064
00:48:53.635 --> 00:48:55.570
Oh, my God.

1065
00:48:55.603 --> 00:48:56.704
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

1066
00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:58.038
No, never.

1067
00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:00.374
But while they have him,
we don't.

1068
00:49:00.407 --> 00:49:01.576
That's why I need you.

1069
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:03.578
Why would you think I'd do that?

1070
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:05.446
"Why?" "Why?"

1071
00:49:05.479 --> 00:49:07.682
How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

1072
00:49:07.715 --> 00:49:09.717
to ever happen
in the history of the world.

1073
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:11.185
How about that?

1074
00:49:11.753 --> 00:49:13.187
Fuck.

1075
00:49:16.624 --> 00:49:18.091
(door shuts)

1076
00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:20.494
They are not gonna
let me onto this project.

1077
00:49:20.528 --> 00:49:22.597
And failing a security check
is not gonna be good

1078
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:24.298
for a career,
even after the war.

1079
00:49:24.331 --> 00:49:27.100
So you're a fellow traveler.
So what?

1080
00:49:27.134 --> 00:49:28.502
This is a national emergency.

1081
00:49:28.536 --> 00:49:31.706
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

1082
00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:33.040
They need us.

1083
00:49:33.073 --> 00:49:35.242
Until they don't.

1084
00:49:38.312 --> 00:49:40.715
Is there any chance of getting
Bohr out of Denmark?

1085
00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:43.751
Nah, no dice.
I checked with the British.

1086
00:49:43.785 --> 00:49:46.086
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

1087
00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:47.522
there's just no way.

1088
00:49:49.056 --> 00:49:50.491
Is he that important?

1089
00:49:50.525 --> 00:49:53.561
How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

1090
00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:56.731
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

1091
00:49:56.764 --> 00:49:58.499
No, plane's too risky.

1092
00:49:58.533 --> 00:50:01.001
Country needs us.

1093
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:04.471
The Harvard guys,

1094
00:50:04.506 --> 00:50:07.074
they say the building's
too small for the cyclotron.

1095
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:11.211
ROBERT: Get them together
with the architects.

1096
00:50:14.414 --> 00:50:16.416
When's this place
supposed to open?

1097
00:50:19.521 --> 00:50:20.320
Two months.

1098
00:50:21.455 --> 00:50:23.725
Robert, you're
the great improviser,

1099
00:50:23.758 --> 00:50:25.793
but this... (sighs)

1100
00:50:25.827 --> 00:50:27.427
you can't do in your head.

1101
00:50:28.462 --> 00:50:30.063
Four divisions.

1102
00:50:31.198 --> 00:50:34.802
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

1103
00:50:34.836 --> 00:50:35.803
Who's running Theoretical?

1104
00:50:35.837 --> 00:50:37.237
ROBERT:
I am.

1105
00:50:37.271 --> 00:50:38.472
RABI:
That's what I was afraid of.

1106
00:50:38.506 --> 00:50:40.374
You're spread too thin.

1107
00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:43.277
So you take Theoretical.

1108
00:50:45.847 --> 00:50:49.082
I'm not coming here, Robert.

1109
00:50:54.722 --> 00:50:56.390
Why not?

1110
00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:01.061
(scoffs)

1111
00:51:02.262 --> 00:51:06.333
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

1112
00:51:06.366 --> 00:51:07.569
(sighs)

1113
00:51:07.602 --> 00:51:10.237
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

1114
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:12.674
to be a weapon
of mass destruction.

1115
00:51:13.741 --> 00:51:16.076
(pensive music playing)

1116
00:51:21.883 --> 00:51:23.216
ROBERT:
Izzy.

1117
00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:28.488
I don't know if we can
be trusted with such a weapon.

1118
00:51:29.857 --> 00:51:33.160
But I know the Nazis can't.

1119
00:51:36.564 --> 00:51:39.366
We have no choice.

1120
00:51:40.768 --> 00:51:42.202
Then...

1121
00:51:43.538 --> 00:51:45.907
...the second thing
you'll have to do is appoint

1122
00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.208
Hans Bethe to run
the Theoretical division.

1123
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:50.545
(rousing music playing)

1124
00:51:50.578 --> 00:51:52.412
Wait, what was the first?

1125
00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:54.916
Take off
that ridiculous uniform.

1126
00:51:54.949 --> 00:51:56.149
You're a scientist.

1127
00:51:56.183 --> 00:51:57.785
Groves is insisting we join.

1128
00:51:57.819 --> 00:52:00.253
Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

1129
00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:03.758
They need us for who we are.
So be yourself.

1130
00:52:03.791 --> 00:52:05.760
Only better.

1131
00:52:05.793 --> 00:52:08.395
(rousing music continues)

1132
00:52:44.799 --> 00:52:46.834
This is the only key.

1133
00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:48.301
And Teller's already here.

1134
00:52:48.335 --> 00:52:50.203
-(sighs)
-Shall I just show him in?

1135
00:52:50.237 --> 00:52:51.906
No, let's wait for the others.

1136
00:52:51.939 --> 00:52:53.473
(door opens)

1137
00:52:59.847 --> 00:53:00.848
Let's get started.

1138
00:53:00.882 --> 00:53:02.950
Hello, Edward.

1139
00:53:02.984 --> 00:53:04.686
Yes.

1140
00:53:04.719 --> 00:53:06.420
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

1141
00:53:06.453 --> 00:53:09.456
until the T-section
at Los Alamos is finished.

1142
00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:11.793
-Edward, can I please...
-It is more important.

1143
00:53:13.861 --> 00:53:15.830
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

1144
00:53:15.863 --> 00:53:18.566
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

1145
00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:20.702
BETHE:
No.

1146
00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:21.969
But this can't be right.

1147
00:53:22.003 --> 00:53:23.938
Show me how
you did your calculations.

1148
00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:25.372
TELLER:
Yes.

1149
00:53:28.876 --> 00:53:29.944
LAWRENCE:
It's exponential.

1150
00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:32.446
BETHE:
No. No, no, no. No.

1151
00:53:34.982 --> 00:53:36.984
This is fantasy.

1152
00:53:37.018 --> 00:53:39.286
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

1153
00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:41.989
Do them yourself
while I go to Princeton.

1154
00:53:42.023 --> 00:53:43.858
-What for?
-To talk to Einstein.

1155
00:53:43.891 --> 00:53:46.460
Well, there's not much
common ground between you two.

1156
00:53:46.493 --> 00:53:49.530
That's why
I should get his view.

1157
00:53:49.564 --> 00:53:51.264
(birds chirping)

1158
00:53:52.967 --> 00:53:54.969
-Albert.
-Hmm?

1159
00:53:55.002 --> 00:53:57.905
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer. (chuckles)

1160
00:53:57.939 --> 00:53:59.406
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

1161
00:53:59.439 --> 00:54:01.008
We walk here most days.

1162
00:54:01.042 --> 00:54:05.847
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

1163
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.347
Albert, might I have a word?

1164
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.785
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

1165
00:54:11.786 --> 00:54:14.722
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1166
00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:16.356
Even in Princeton.

1167
00:54:16.389 --> 00:54:19.493
He's convinced that the Nazis
can poison his food.

1168
00:54:19.527 --> 00:54:20.795
Mm.

1169
00:54:20.828 --> 00:54:22.663
Hmm? Huh.

1170
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:26.366
Wha...

1171
00:54:26.399 --> 00:54:28.603
(suspenseful music playing)

1172
00:54:30.905 --> 00:54:33.741
Whose... Whose work is this?

1173
00:54:33.775 --> 00:54:34.809
Teller's.

1174
00:54:35.943 --> 00:54:38.411
What do you take it to mean?

1175
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:40.380
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1176
00:54:40.413 --> 00:54:44.451
releasing neutrons
to smash into other nuclei.

1177
00:54:44.484 --> 00:54:46.687
Criticality,
a point of no return,

1178
00:54:46.721 --> 00:54:48.321
massive explosive force.

1179
00:54:48.355 --> 00:54:50.691
But this time,
the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1180
00:54:51.592 --> 00:54:54.562
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1181
00:54:54.595 --> 00:54:55.596
(whooshing)

1182
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:57.598
When we detonate
an atomic device,

1183
00:54:57.632 --> 00:54:59.801
we might start
a chain reaction that...

1184
00:55:00.768 --> 00:55:02.302
...destroys the world.

1185
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.372
So here we are, hmm?

1186
00:55:05.405 --> 00:55:09.710
Lost in your quantum world
of probabilities

1187
00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.478
and needing certainty.

1188
00:55:11.512 --> 00:55:14.381
Can you run
the calculations yourself?

1189
00:55:14.414 --> 00:55:15.817
(chuckles) About the only thing

1190
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:19.120
you and I have in common
is a disdain for mathematics.

1191
00:55:19.153 --> 00:55:21.722
Who's working on this
in-in Berkeley?

1192
00:55:21.756 --> 00:55:23.057
Hans Bethe.

1193
00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:24.926
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1194
00:55:26.561 --> 00:55:29.429
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

1195
00:55:29.462 --> 00:55:30.765
Then you stop.

1196
00:55:30.798 --> 00:55:34.535
And you share your findings
with the Nazis.

1197
00:55:34.569 --> 00:55:37.705
So neither side
destroys the world.

1198
00:55:40.908 --> 00:55:41.943
Robert.

1199
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.614
This is yours, not mine.

1200
00:55:59.492 --> 00:56:00.895
BETHE:
Teller's wrong.

1201
00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:02.129
-He's wrong.
-(shushing)

1202
00:56:02.163 --> 00:56:04.397
(keys jingling)

1203
00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:14.508
BETHE: When you know
Teller's critical assumptions,

1204
00:56:14.542 --> 00:56:15.877
the real picture emerges.

1205
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:17.712
Bottom line?

1206
00:56:17.745 --> 00:56:19.847
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction

1207
00:56:19.881 --> 00:56:20.882
are near zero.

1208
00:56:20.915 --> 00:56:23.551
Near zero. (breathes heavily)

1209
00:56:23.584 --> 00:56:25.853
-Oppie, this is good news.
-Mm.

1210
00:56:27.188 --> 00:56:28.421
Can you run them again?

1211
00:56:28.455 --> 00:56:30.191
No, you'll get the same answer.

1212
00:56:30.224 --> 00:56:31.792
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1213
00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:34.662
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

1214
00:56:34.695 --> 00:56:35.763
Near zero.

1215
00:56:37.965 --> 00:56:40.635
(exhales sharply) Theory
will take you only so far.

1216
00:56:40.668 --> 00:56:42.169
-BETHE: Mm.
-CHEVALIER: <i>Hello!</i>

1217
00:56:42.203 --> 00:56:43.504
-BARBARA: Hello, you.
-KITTY: Hi.

1218
00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:44.872
BARBARA:
We missed him.

1219
00:56:44.906 --> 00:56:46.040
You want to adopt?

1220
00:56:46.073 --> 00:56:47.474
-She's kidding.
-(Kitty chuckles)

1221
00:56:47.508 --> 00:56:49.442
We wanted to see you
before we left.

1222
00:56:49.476 --> 00:56:52.647
-For parts unknown.
-(chuckles)

1223
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.216
CHEVALIER: You know who
I ran into the other day?

1224
00:56:55.249 --> 00:56:56.884
Eltenton.

1225
00:56:56.918 --> 00:56:58.185
ROBERT:
Oh.

1226
00:56:58.219 --> 00:56:59.921
The chemist from Shell?
The union guy?

1227
00:56:59.954 --> 00:57:03.824
CHEVALIER: Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

1228
00:57:03.858 --> 00:57:07.228
He was moaning about
how we're handling the war.

1229
00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:09.462
ROBERT:
How so?

1230
00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:12.233
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1231
00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:14.602
Apparently
our government's not sharing

1232
00:57:14.635 --> 00:57:16.737
any research with the Russians.

1233
00:57:16.771 --> 00:57:17.738
Well, he said,

1234
00:57:17.772 --> 00:57:20.508
"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

1235
00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:23.811
(suspenseful music playing)

1236
00:57:23.844 --> 00:57:25.680
-ROBERT: Oh, yeah?
-CHEVALIER: Yeah.

1237
00:57:25.713 --> 00:57:28.082
He mentioned that if anyone

1238
00:57:28.115 --> 00:57:31.085
had anything
they wanted to pass on,

1239
00:57:31.118 --> 00:57:32.954
uh, going around
official channels,

1240
00:57:32.987 --> 00:57:34.922
that he could help.

1241
00:57:43.564 --> 00:57:45.232
That would be treason.

1242
00:57:45.266 --> 00:57:48.102
Yes, of course.

1243
00:57:48.135 --> 00:57:49.937
I just thought you should know.

1244
00:57:53.074 --> 00:57:54.542
The brat is down.

1245
00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:55.943
Where are the martinis?

1246
00:58:01.148 --> 00:58:02.650
Coming right up.

1247
00:58:02.683 --> 00:58:04.151
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

1248
00:58:04.185 --> 00:58:06.287
Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

1249
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.888
would have led me to believe

1250
00:58:07.922 --> 00:58:10.658
that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

1251
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:13.160
and I am certain
that he had no idea

1252
00:58:13.194 --> 00:58:15.495
of the work in which
I was engaged.

1253
00:58:20.034 --> 00:58:22.003
It has long been clear to me

1254
00:58:22.036 --> 00:58:24.739
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1255
00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:26.273
SENATOR McGEE:
<i>The Oppenheimer situation</i>

1256
00:58:26.307 --> 00:58:29.210
<i>highlights the tension</i>
<i>between scientists</i>

1257
00:58:29.243 --> 00:58:30.845
and the security apparatus.

1258
00:58:30.878 --> 00:58:32.747
In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

1259
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.116
such issues during
his time at the AEC,

1260
00:58:35.149 --> 00:58:38.652
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1261
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.888
Who are they bringing in?

1262
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:41.889
They hadn't said.

1263
00:58:41.922 --> 00:58:43.290
STRAUSS:
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1264
00:58:43.324 --> 00:58:45.860
I'm nominated
for Commerce Secretary.

1265
00:58:45.893 --> 00:58:48.195
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

1266
00:58:48.229 --> 00:58:50.564
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

1267
00:58:50.598 --> 00:58:52.767
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1268
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.603
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

1269
00:58:55.636 --> 00:58:57.138
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1270
00:58:57.171 --> 00:58:59.306
This is not a court.

1271
00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.742
STRAUSS:
(grunts) Formality, huh?

1272
00:59:01.776 --> 00:59:03.044
SENATE AIDE:
No presidential Cabinet nominee

1273
00:59:03.077 --> 00:59:05.646
has failed to be confirmed
since 1925.

1274
00:59:05.679 --> 00:59:07.782
This is just how
the game is played.

1275
00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:09.116
It's in the bag, Lewis.

1276
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.351
So play nice.

1277
00:59:10.384 --> 00:59:12.653
<i>They bring in a scientist,</i>
<i>so what?</i>

1278
00:59:12.686 --> 00:59:14.688
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1279
00:59:14.722 --> 00:59:16.757
They resent anyone
who questions their judgment,

1280
00:59:16.791 --> 00:59:18.793
<i>especially if you're</i>
<i>not one of them.</i>

1281
00:59:18.826 --> 00:59:20.127
I was chair of the AEC.

1282
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:22.596
I'm easy to blame
for what happened to Robert.

1283
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:23.931
We can't have
the Senate thinking

1284
00:59:23.964 --> 00:59:27.068
the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

1285
00:59:27.101 --> 00:59:28.936
Or should we pivot?

1286
00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:30.938
-SENATE AIDE: To what?
-And embrace it.

1287
00:59:30.971 --> 00:59:33.741
"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."

1288
00:59:33.774 --> 00:59:35.342
I-I don't think
we need to go there.

1289
00:59:35.376 --> 00:59:37.645
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1290
00:59:37.678 --> 00:59:39.113
-Teller.
-He'll make an impression.

1291
00:59:39.146 --> 00:59:41.215
Can you get the name of
the scientist they've called?

1292
00:59:41.248 --> 00:59:42.817
-Probably.
-Find out if he was

1293
00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:45.219
based in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.

1294
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:46.620
Why does that matter?

1295
00:59:46.654 --> 00:59:47.855
Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

1296
00:59:47.888 --> 00:59:49.290
then he worked
under Szilard and Fermi,

1297
00:59:49.323 --> 00:59:51.625
not the cult of Oppie
at Los Alamos.

1298
00:59:51.659 --> 00:59:52.893
Robert built that damn place.

1299
00:59:52.927 --> 00:59:55.696
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

1300
00:59:55.729 --> 00:59:57.131
all rolled into one.

1301
00:59:57.164 --> 00:59:59.600
(gripping music playing)

1302
01:00:05.406 --> 01:00:08.142
(baby crying)

1303
01:00:10.077 --> 01:00:11.879
All it needs is a saloon.

1304
01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:39.240
(mutters indistinctly)

1305
01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:42.877
There's no kitchen.

1306
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:46.847
Really? We'll fix that.

1307
01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:49.116
(gripping music continues)

1308
01:00:52.753 --> 01:00:56.157
BETHE:
Barbed wire, guns.

1309
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.291
Oppie.

1310
01:00:57.324 --> 01:00:58.959
ROBERT:
We're at war, Hans.

1311
01:01:01.362 --> 01:01:03.931
Halifax. 1917.

1312
01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:06.934
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1313
01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:09.303
(explosions)

1314
01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:12.273
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1315
01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:14.175
(violent whooshing)

1316
01:01:15.943 --> 01:01:18.779
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1317
01:01:18.812 --> 01:01:20.781
Now let's calculate
how much more destructive

1318
01:01:20.814 --> 01:01:23.484
it would have been
if it were a nuclear

1319
01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.186
and not a chemical reaction.

1320
01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:28.856
Expressing power in terms
of tons of TNT.

1321
01:01:28.889 --> 01:01:30.391
But it will be thousands.

1322
01:01:30.424 --> 01:01:33.861
Well, then kilotons.

1323
01:01:37.431 --> 01:01:40.801
Using U-235,

1324
01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:43.404
-the bomb will need a...
-Uh-uh.

1325
01:01:43.437 --> 01:01:46.508
Sorry. Gadget will need
a 33-pound sphere

1326
01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:48.008
about this size.

1327
01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:51.845
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1328
01:01:53.247 --> 01:01:54.481
Here's the amount of uranium

1329
01:01:54.516 --> 01:01:57.851
Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

1330
01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:04.258
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1331
01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:08.495
Now, if we can enrich
these amounts,

1332
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.332
-we need a way to detonate them.
-(paper tearing)

1333
01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:13.467
Are we boring you, Edward?

1334
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.102
TELLER:
A little bit, yes.

1335
01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:16.370
May I ask why?

1336
01:02:16.403 --> 01:02:17.838
TELLER:
We all entered this room

1337
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:19.807
knowing a fission bomb
was possible.

1338
01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.443
How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

1339
01:02:22.476 --> 01:02:23.477
Such as?

1340
01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:26.247
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

1341
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.281
we use hydrogen.

1342
01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:28.816
(others murmur and laugh)

1343
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:30.451
-TELLER: Heavy hydrogen.
-FEYNMAN: Hydrogen.

1344
01:02:30.484 --> 01:02:33.254
Deuterium. You see?

1345
01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:34.989
We compact the atoms together

1346
01:02:35.022 --> 01:02:38.092
under great pressure
to induce a fusion reaction.

1347
01:02:39.026 --> 01:02:41.862
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1348
01:02:41.895 --> 01:02:42.963
but megatons.

1349
01:02:42.997 --> 01:02:43.931
FEYNMAN:
A big fission reaction...

1350
01:02:43.964 --> 01:02:45.533
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1351
01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:50.271
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1352
01:02:50.304 --> 01:02:52.373
A small fission bomb.

1353
01:02:52.406 --> 01:02:54.108
FEYNMAN:
There we are.

1354
01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:56.010
-(laughter)
-(scattered applause)

1355
01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:57.845
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1356
01:02:57.878 --> 01:02:59.847
can we get back
to the business at hand?

1357
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.215
SENATOR BARTLETT:
The isotopes issue

1358
01:03:01.248 --> 01:03:04.885
wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

1359
01:03:04.918 --> 01:03:06.554
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1360
01:03:06.588 --> 01:03:08.989
It was the hydrogen bomb,
wasn't it?

1361
01:03:09.023 --> 01:03:11.892
Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

1362
01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:13.927
on a great many things, uh,

1363
01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.195
and, well, one of them

1364
01:03:15.229 --> 01:03:18.299
was the need
for an H-bomb program, yes.

1365
01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:21.302
-(siren wailing)
-(uneasy music playing)

1366
01:03:31.145 --> 01:03:33.914
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

1367
01:03:33.947 --> 01:03:35.416
I can't believe it.

1368
01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.951
Well, here we are.

1369
01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:39.987
Catch me up. What do we know?

1370
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.524
One of our B-29s
over the North Pacific

1371
01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.058
has detected radiation.

1372
01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:45.859
Do we have the filter papers?

1373
01:03:45.893 --> 01:03:47.895
There's no doubt what this is.

1374
01:03:47.928 --> 01:03:49.129
White House says
there's a doubt.

1375
01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:50.598
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1376
01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:53.334
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1377
01:03:54.268 --> 01:03:56.337
It's an atomic test.

1378
01:03:58.972 --> 01:04:00.374
The Russians have a bomb.

1379
01:04:00.407 --> 01:04:04.144
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

1380
01:04:04.178 --> 01:04:06.480
What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

1381
01:04:06.514 --> 01:04:07.649
Wasn't security tight?

1382
01:04:07.682 --> 01:04:09.183
Of course it was.
You weren't there.

1383
01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:11.619
-It was...
-NICHOLS: Forgive me, Doctor...

1384
01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:14.088
but I was there.

1385
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.490
SERBER:
We can now consider

1386
01:04:16.524 --> 01:04:18.459
the actual mechanics
of detonation.

1387
01:04:18.492 --> 01:04:19.627
ROBERT:
Any ideas?

1388
01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:21.395
SERBER:
I call this "shooting."

1389
01:04:21.428 --> 01:04:24.965
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1390
01:04:24.998 --> 01:04:27.501
with enough force
to achieve criticality.

1391
01:04:27.535 --> 01:04:29.203
What do we think? Anyone?

1392
01:04:29.236 --> 01:04:31.038
TOLMAN: I've been
thinking about implosion.

1393
01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:33.040
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards,

1394
01:04:33.073 --> 01:04:35.109
-crushing the material.
-(blasting)

1395
01:04:35.142 --> 01:04:37.077
I'd like to investigate
that idea.

1396
01:04:37.111 --> 01:04:39.413
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1397
01:04:40.414 --> 01:04:41.516
GROVES:
Progress?

1398
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:43.384
Nice to see you too.

1399
01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.185
Meet the British contingent.

1400
01:04:45.219 --> 01:04:47.054
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1401
01:04:47.087 --> 01:04:48.956
How long have you been British?

1402
01:04:48.989 --> 01:04:50.190
Since Hitler told me
I wasn't German.

1403
01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:54.027
Uh-huh.
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1404
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:55.929
School's up and running.

1405
01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:58.265
Bar. Always running.

1406
01:04:58.298 --> 01:05:01.301
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1407
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:04.271
-Is that...
-ROBERT: Mrs. Serber, yes.

1408
01:05:04.304 --> 01:05:05.707
I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

1409
01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.207
Admin, librarians, computation.

1410
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:09.544
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1411
01:05:09.577 --> 01:05:12.146
-Are these women qualified?
-ROBERT: Don't be absurd.

1412
01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:14.549
These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

1413
01:05:14.582 --> 01:05:16.150
And they're already
security cleared.

1414
01:05:16.183 --> 01:05:18.051
I've informed General Groves
you've been holding

1415
01:05:18.085 --> 01:05:19.554
cross-divisional
open discussions

1416
01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:21.288
-on a nightly basis.
-Shut them down.

1417
01:05:21.321 --> 01:05:23.658
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

1418
01:05:23.691 --> 01:05:25.192
CONDON:
It's only the top men.

1419
01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:27.060
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1420
01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:28.295
These men aren't stupid.

1421
01:05:28.328 --> 01:05:30.164
-They can be discreet.
-I don't like it.

1422
01:05:30.197 --> 01:05:33.100
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

1423
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.175
Once a week. Top men only.

1424
01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.577
I'd like to bring
my brother here.

1425
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.077
No.

1426
01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:46.480
Uh, Nichols...

1427
01:05:47.615 --> 01:05:49.551
I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

1428
01:05:49.584 --> 01:05:51.151
-has been approved.
-It hasn't.

1429
01:05:51.185 --> 01:05:52.554
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1430
01:05:52.587 --> 01:05:53.621
No, you should wait.

1431
01:05:54.823 --> 01:05:55.924
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

1432
01:05:55.956 --> 01:05:59.026
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1433
01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:01.061
is proving difficult to obtain
is not my fault.

1434
01:06:01.094 --> 01:06:02.362
It's yours.

1435
01:06:02.396 --> 01:06:04.331
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1436
01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:05.365
Because I'm going.

1437
01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:09.169
STRAUSS: And how many people
were in these, uh,

1438
01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:11.405
-open discussions?
-NICHOLS: Too many.

1439
01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:12.774
Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

1440
01:06:12.807 --> 01:06:14.742
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1441
01:06:14.776 --> 01:06:17.211
And now the race
is against the Soviets.

1442
01:06:17.244 --> 01:06:18.746
-Not unless we start it.
-STRAUSS: Robert.

1443
01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.182
They just fired a starting gun.

1444
01:06:22.216 --> 01:06:24.184
What's the nature
of the device they detonated?

1445
01:06:24.218 --> 01:06:25.753
ROBERT: The data indicates
it may have been

1446
01:06:25.787 --> 01:06:28.088
a plutonium implosion device.

1447
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:31.225
Like the one you built
at Los Alamos.

1448
01:06:31.258 --> 01:06:33.093
The Russians have a bomb,

1449
01:06:33.126 --> 01:06:34.394
Truman needs to know
what's next.

1450
01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:36.230
What's next? Arms talks.

1451
01:06:36.263 --> 01:06:38.131
-Arms talks.
-Obviously.

1452
01:06:39.066 --> 01:06:40.267
What about the Super?

1453
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.035
Does Truman even know about it?

1454
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:44.071
Did we brief him on that?

1455
01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:45.172
Not specifically.

1456
01:06:45.205 --> 01:06:46.508
ROBERT:
We still don't know

1457
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:48.308
if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

1458
01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.244
Right, my understanding
is that Teller proposed it?

1459
01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:52.112
-ROBERT: Yes.
-At Los Alamos?

1460
01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:53.781
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

1461
01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:56.149
You'd have to deliver
by ox cart.

1462
01:06:56.183 --> 01:06:57.451
-Not airplane.
-LAWRENCE: Oppie.

1463
01:06:57.484 --> 01:07:01.188
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

1464
01:07:02.422 --> 01:07:03.525
No.

1465
01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:07.662
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1466
01:07:07.695 --> 01:07:10.732
the President
of the United States

1467
01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.767
needs to know about it.

1468
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.268
(scoffs)

1469
01:07:14.301 --> 01:07:16.103
And if the Russians
know about it already,

1470
01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:19.139
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1471
01:07:19.172 --> 01:07:20.474
then we've gotta get going.

1472
01:07:20.508 --> 01:07:23.477
There's no proof there was
a spy at Los Alamos.

1473
01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:24.579
Robert.

1474
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.582
(dramatic music playing)

1475
01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:31.184
They put it under
the football stadium?

1476
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.153
The field's not in use anymore.

1477
01:07:33.186 --> 01:07:35.422
Just as well.

1478
01:07:36.724 --> 01:07:39.159
-FERMI: Oppie.
-Dr. Fermi.

1479
01:07:39.192 --> 01:07:41.829
(greets in Italian)

1480
01:07:41.863 --> 01:07:43.196
I hear you got a little town.

1481
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:44.464
Yes. Come and see.

1482
01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:46.166
(Szilard scoffs)

1483
01:07:46.199 --> 01:07:50.304
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1484
01:07:50.337 --> 01:07:52.272
Everybody will go crazy.

1485
01:07:52.306 --> 01:07:56.176
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

1486
01:07:56.209 --> 01:07:59.847
Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

1487
01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:02.316
When are you going
to try it out?

1488
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:03.383
We did.

1489
01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:07.789
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1490
01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.456
Didn't Groves tell you?

1491
01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:11.124
No.

1492
01:08:11.158 --> 01:08:13.126
(crackling)

1493
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.597
(Robert exhales)

1494
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:18.733
GUARD: One at a time, please,
one at a time.

1495
01:08:18.766 --> 01:08:20.233
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1496
01:08:21.335 --> 01:08:23.805
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.

1497
01:08:23.838 --> 01:08:25.138
Can you?

1498
01:08:25.172 --> 01:08:26.306
Harvard forgot to teach that

1499
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.175
on the graduate
chemistry course.

1500
01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:32.446
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here
on the plutonium team.

1501
01:08:33.815 --> 01:08:36.183
(door slams)

1502
01:08:38.218 --> 01:08:39.887
What the hell
were you doing in Chicago?

1503
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:41.388
Visiting the Met?

1504
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.422
-Why? Why?
-Well, you can't talk to...

1505
01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:44.491
Because we have every right...

1506
01:08:44.525 --> 01:08:46.861
You have just the rights
that I give you.

1507
01:08:46.894 --> 01:08:48.362
No more, no less.

1508
01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:50.832
We are adults
trying to run a project here.

1509
01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:52.567
This is ridiculous.

1510
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.368
Tell him.

1511
01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:57.538
Compartmentalization
is the protocol we agreed to.

1512
01:08:58.673 --> 01:08:59.907
Enough of this madhouse.

1513
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:02.309
Nobody can work
under these conditions.

1514
01:09:02.342 --> 01:09:06.781
You know what, Generalissimo?
I quit.

1515
01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:08.215
Thanks for nothing.

1516
01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:11.819
GROVES:
Better off without him.

1517
01:09:11.853 --> 01:09:13.220
(door slams shut)

1518
01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.287
Aren't you more concerned

1519
01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:16.691
about his discretion out there?

1520
01:09:16.724 --> 01:09:19.127
We'll have him killed.

1521
01:09:19.961 --> 01:09:22.530
I was just kidding. (chuckles)

1522
01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:25.499
-No, he hates me, not America.
-You know, General,

1523
01:09:25.533 --> 01:09:27.869
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

1524
01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:29.737
I don't think I understand.

1525
01:09:29.771 --> 01:09:31.939
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

1526
01:09:31.973 --> 01:09:33.708
You hired me because of it.

1527
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:36.678
So you could control me.

1528
01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:39.312
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1529
01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.381
I'm just a humble soldier.

1530
01:09:41.415 --> 01:09:42.917
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

1531
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:43.951
You studied engineering at MIT.

1532
01:09:43.985 --> 01:09:45.820
Guilty as charged.

1533
01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:47.354
Well, now we understand
each other,

1534
01:09:47.387 --> 01:09:48.823
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1535
01:09:48.856 --> 01:09:51.659
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1536
01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:58.298
LLOYD GARRISON:
<i>General Groves, were you aware</i>

1537
01:09:58.331 --> 01:10:00.635
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's</i>
<i>left-wing associations</i>

1538
01:10:00.668 --> 01:10:02.335
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

1539
01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:04.005
GROVES: I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1540
01:10:04.038 --> 01:10:05.907
I was aware he had
a very extreme

1541
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.307
liberal background.

1542
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.943
In your opinion,
would he ever consciously

1543
01:10:08.976 --> 01:10:10.277
commit a disloyal act?

1544
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:11.913
I would be amazed if he did.

1545
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:15.016
GARRISON: So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

1546
01:10:15.049 --> 01:10:16.450
At Los Alamos, yes,

1547
01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:17.819
which is where
I really knew him.

1548
01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:19.821
General,
did your security officers

1549
01:10:19.854 --> 01:10:21.321
on the project advise you

1550
01:10:21.354 --> 01:10:22.824
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1551
01:10:22.857 --> 01:10:26.661
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1552
01:10:26.694 --> 01:10:29.329
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1553
01:10:29.362 --> 01:10:30.598
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1554
01:10:30.631 --> 01:10:32.299
GROVES:
I did.

1555
01:10:32.332 --> 01:10:33.500
Well, then there's only
really one question

1556
01:10:33.534 --> 01:10:35.002
I need answered here today.

1557
01:10:35.036 --> 01:10:36.738
In light of
the current AEC guidelines,

1558
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:39.473
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1559
01:10:39.507 --> 01:10:41.576
Do you have the guidelines?

1560
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:51.318
ROBB:
Under current AEC guidelines,

1561
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:53.386
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1562
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.657
-(birds chirping)
-(rooster crowing)

1563
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.402
Physics and New Mexico, huh?
(chuckles)

1564
01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:12.472
My God. What a trek.

1565
01:11:12.507 --> 01:11:13.975
That's why you need a liaison.

1566
01:11:14.008 --> 01:11:15.543
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1567
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:17.779
You're gonna be okay.

1568
01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:18.980
This way, gentlemen.

1569
01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:20.815
(stirring music playing)

1570
01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:23.350
(speaking indistinctly)

1571
01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:30.792
-Dr. Lawrence.
-Leslie.

1572
01:11:30.825 --> 01:11:33.393
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1573
01:11:33.426 --> 01:11:35.763
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

1574
01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:39.934
LOMANITZ:
Okay.

1575
01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:41.068
(indistinct chatter)

1576
01:11:41.102 --> 01:11:42.537
Thank you.

1577
01:11:46.974 --> 01:11:49.442
(cheering and applauding)

1578
01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:51.679
LAWRENCE:
<i>Greetings from Berkeley.</i>

1579
01:11:51.712 --> 01:11:53.848
I am here to update you
on our progress

1580
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:55.415
and solicit your input.

1581
01:11:55.448 --> 01:11:56.818
To do so,
I am going to have to share

1582
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:00.521
a few things that
General Groves told me not to.

1583
01:12:00.555 --> 01:12:02.355
Sorry, General,
I said I understood,

1584
01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:03.456
not that I agreed.

1585
01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:05.026
-(laughter)
-'Kay.

1586
01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:07.094
Gentlemen, to business.

1587
01:12:07.128 --> 01:12:09.496
There were rumors of espionage
at Los Alamos.

1588
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:10.998
ROBERT: Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

1589
01:12:11.032 --> 01:12:12.499
STRAUSS:
I'm told

1590
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:13.835
that there were Communists
on the project.

1591
01:12:13.868 --> 01:12:15.636
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

1592
01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.437
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

1593
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:18.940
in discussions of the Super?

1594
01:12:18.973 --> 01:12:21.142
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1595
01:12:21.175 --> 01:12:23.443
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1596
01:12:23.476 --> 01:12:24.712
What about Lomanitz?

1597
01:12:24.745 --> 01:12:26.479
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

1598
01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:27.515
He was a liaison.

1599
01:12:27.548 --> 01:12:28.716
Our security was tight,

1600
01:12:28.749 --> 01:12:30.117
as former Colonel Nichols
well knows.

1601
01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.719
Our security was as tight
as it could be

1602
01:12:31.752 --> 01:12:33.120
given the personalities
involved,

1603
01:12:33.154 --> 01:12:34.989
but attempts were made.

1604
01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:36.023
What is that supposed to mean?

1605
01:12:36.057 --> 01:12:37.625
We've all read his file here.

1606
01:12:38.659 --> 01:12:40.661
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1607
01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:43.363
Or the Chevalier incident?

1608
01:12:47.969 --> 01:12:49.369
'Scuse me.

1609
01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:52.640
(telephone ringing)

1610
01:12:52.673 --> 01:12:54.642
CHARLOTTE:
That's Lomanitz, line one.

1611
01:13:00.514 --> 01:13:01.549
Hello, Rossi.

1612
01:13:01.582 --> 01:13:04.785
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

1613
01:13:05.753 --> 01:13:08.990
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1614
01:13:09.023 --> 01:13:11.491
-We are at war, Doctor.
-Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1615
01:13:11.525 --> 01:13:13.527
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1616
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:14.762
It wasn't a mistake.

1617
01:13:14.795 --> 01:13:16.130
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1618
01:13:16.163 --> 01:13:18.431
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1619
01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:19.767
He promised to quit all that.

1620
01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.702
Well, he hasn't.

1621
01:13:21.736 --> 01:13:23.604
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about

1622
01:13:23.638 --> 01:13:25.940
Communist infiltration
through that union,

1623
01:13:25.973 --> 01:13:28.576
-the F.A...
-F.A.E.C.T.

1624
01:13:30.978 --> 01:13:34.682
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

1625
01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:38.686
Your Q clearance came through.

1626
01:13:42.223 --> 01:13:43.658
It's important
you not maintain or renew

1627
01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:45.960
any questionable associations.

1628
01:13:50.698 --> 01:13:53.200
ROBB: <i>Doctor, did you think</i>
<i>social contacts</i>

1629
01:13:53.234 --> 01:13:55.569
between a person engaged
on secret war work

1630
01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:56.971
and Communists was dangerous?

1631
01:13:57.004 --> 01:14:00.675
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1632
01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:03.611
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1633
01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:06.847
<i>you felt that such contacts</i>
<i>were potentially dangerous.</i>

1634
01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:13.254
(elevator dings)

1635
01:14:13.287 --> 01:14:16.257
ROBERT:
<i>Were conceivably dangerous, yes.</i>

1636
01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.559
ROBB:
<i>I mean, really,</i>

1637
01:14:18.592 --> 01:14:20.628
<i>known Communists.</i>

1638
01:14:22.763 --> 01:14:24.999
ROBERT:
<i>Look... (sighs)</i>

1639
01:14:25.032 --> 01:14:26.567
I've had a lot of secrets

1640
01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.570
<i>-in my head for a long time.</i>
-(knock on door)

1641
01:14:30.538 --> 01:14:31.806
<i>Doesn't matter</i>
<i>who I associate with.</i>

1642
01:14:31.839 --> 01:14:34.742
I don't talk about
those secrets.

1643
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:43.784
ROBB:
You said in your statement

1644
01:14:43.818 --> 01:14:49.757
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1645
01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:52.893
You left.

1646
01:14:54.128 --> 01:14:55.563
Not a word.

1647
01:14:55.596 --> 01:14:58.065
What did you think
that would do to me?

1648
01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.234
I wrote.

1649
01:15:00.267 --> 01:15:02.670
Pages of nothing.

1650
01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:07.274
Where did you go?

1651
01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:09.744
-I can't tell you.
-Why not?

1652
01:15:09.777 --> 01:15:12.513
Because you're a Communist.

1653
01:15:14.048 --> 01:15:15.916
Why did you have to see her?

1654
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:19.053
Because she had indicated
a great desire

1655
01:15:19.086 --> 01:15:20.755
to see me before we left.

1656
01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:21.956
At that time, I couldn't,

1657
01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:25.793
but I felt that
she had to see me.

1658
01:15:25.826 --> 01:15:28.329
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1659
01:15:28.362 --> 01:15:30.598
She was extremely unhappy.

1660
01:15:30.631 --> 01:15:32.633
Did you find out
why she had to see you?

1661
01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.802
(grim music playing)

1662
01:15:37.738 --> 01:15:39.807
Because she was
still in love with me.

1663
01:15:41.675 --> 01:15:44.578
(heavy breathing)

1664
01:15:47.014 --> 01:15:49.083
Spent the night together,
didn't you?

1665
01:15:57.058 --> 01:15:58.092
ROBERT:
Yes.

1666
01:16:03.764 --> 01:16:07.635
You drop in and out of my life,

1667
01:16:07.668 --> 01:16:10.137
and you don't
have to tell me why.

1668
01:16:10.171 --> 01:16:11.639
Now that's power.

1669
01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:13.707
Not that I enjoy.

1670
01:16:14.675 --> 01:16:16.811
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1671
01:16:16.844 --> 01:16:19.313
But you have
other priorities now.

1672
01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:22.116
I have a wife and child.

1673
01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:25.920
That's not what either of us
is talking about.

1674
01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:31.225
Jean.

1675
01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:33.394
You asked me to come.

1676
01:16:33.427 --> 01:16:35.796
And I'm glad I did.

1677
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.999
But I can't see you again.

1678
01:16:41.402 --> 01:16:43.104
But what if I need you?

1679
01:16:46.674 --> 01:16:49.643
You said you would
always answer.

1680
01:16:52.113 --> 01:16:53.247
Not a word?

1681
01:16:54.516 --> 01:16:55.584
ROBB: <i>Did you think that</i>
<i>consistent with good security?</i>

1682
01:16:55.616 --> 01:16:58.285
-As a matter of fact, it was.
-(rhythmic stomping)

1683
01:16:58.319 --> 01:17:00.688
<i>Not a word.</i>

1684
01:17:00.721 --> 01:17:02.890
ROBB: When did you
see her after that?

1685
01:17:03.724 --> 01:17:05.893
(stomping intensifying)

1686
01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:11.265
(stomping stops)

1687
01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:12.967
I never saw her again.

1688
01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:21.809
I can make the last train
back to Princeton.

1689
01:17:21.842 --> 01:17:25.012
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1690
01:17:25.045 --> 01:17:27.181
Today you said it to history,
didn't you?

1691
01:17:27.214 --> 01:17:28.749
This is a closed hearing.

1692
01:17:30.451 --> 01:17:32.052
KITTY: If they don't release
the transcript,

1693
01:17:32.086 --> 01:17:34.088
-I'm sure you will.
-ROBERT: I was under oath.

1694
01:17:34.121 --> 01:17:35.890
KITTY: Well, you were
under an oath for me

1695
01:17:35.923 --> 01:17:37.725
when you went to see Jean.

1696
01:17:38.392 --> 01:17:39.827
You know, you...

1697
01:17:40.728 --> 01:17:43.030
...you sit there, day after day,

1698
01:17:43.063 --> 01:17:46.100
letting them pick our lives
to pieces.

1699
01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:50.804
Why won't you fight?

1700
01:17:53.941 --> 01:17:57.077
GARRISON: Robert, I'm not
putting her up there.

1701
01:18:02.216 --> 01:18:05.085
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.

1702
01:18:05.119 --> 01:18:08.722
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

1703
01:18:08.756 --> 01:18:10.925
talk to Lomanitz while I'm here,
given your concerns.

1704
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:13.060
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

1705
01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:15.262
-but I'd be cautious.
-Uh-huh. Understood.

1706
01:18:15.296 --> 01:18:18.032
Oh, and, um, (clears throat)
as regards to the union,

1707
01:18:18.065 --> 01:18:19.833
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

1708
01:18:19.867 --> 01:18:21.202
on a man named Eltenton.

1709
01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:22.736
A heads-up?

1710
01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:26.707
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

1711
01:18:27.509 --> 01:18:28.943
Well, I'd love
to get more details.

1712
01:18:28.976 --> 01:18:31.312
Well, I...
I have an appointment now

1713
01:18:31.345 --> 01:18:32.780
and I leave early tomorrow.

1714
01:18:32.813 --> 01:18:34.348
Well, come back
as early as you like.

1715
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.717
Since you haven't time now.

1716
01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:39.220
You went back the next morning.

1717
01:18:39.253 --> 01:18:41.255
I did, I had to, really.

1718
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:44.792
<i>This time, there was</i>
<i>another man.</i>

1719
01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:46.961
He said his name's Pash.

1720
01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:49.496
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1721
01:18:49.531 --> 01:18:51.065
ROBB: Colonel Pash,
could you please read

1722
01:18:51.098 --> 01:18:54.902
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

1723
01:18:57.004 --> 01:18:59.106
PASH: "Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1724
01:18:59.139 --> 01:19:01.976
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1725
01:19:02.009 --> 01:19:04.178
"Subject met with
and spent considerable time

1726
01:19:04.211 --> 01:19:06.413
"with one Jean Tatlock,
Communist,

1727
01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:07.915
the record of whom is attached."

1728
01:19:07.948 --> 01:19:09.817
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1729
01:19:09.850 --> 01:19:12.319
-PASH: Yes.
-ROBB: Whom you had not met?

1730
01:19:12.353 --> 01:19:14.154
PASH:
Not then, but soon after.

1731
01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:15.557
He's the head of security
for the project.

1732
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:16.824
Shouldn't I know him?

1733
01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:18.192
No, he should know you.

1734
01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:20.127
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

1735
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.428
-Why not?
-(sighs)

1736
01:19:21.462 --> 01:19:23.531
When Pash first heard
about Lomanitz,

1737
01:19:23.565 --> 01:19:26.500
he told the FBI
he was gonna kidnap him,

1738
01:19:26.534 --> 01:19:28.002
take him out on a boat

1739
01:19:28.035 --> 01:19:31.038
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1740
01:19:33.173 --> 01:19:36.010
General Groves has placed in me
a certain responsibility,

1741
01:19:36.043 --> 01:19:38.279
and it's like having a child
who I can't see.

1742
01:19:38.312 --> 01:19:40.414
-Ah.
-By remote control.

1743
01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:44.051
-(chuckles quietly)
-So to actually meet you is...

1744
01:19:45.152 --> 01:19:46.588
I won't take up
too much of your time.

1745
01:19:46.621 --> 01:19:48.889
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

1746
01:19:48.922 --> 01:19:51.825
Mm. Mr. Johnson told me
of a conversation

1747
01:19:51.859 --> 01:19:53.595
you had yesterday
in which I'm very interested.

1748
01:19:53.628 --> 01:19:55.896
It's had me worried all day.

1749
01:19:55.929 --> 01:19:58.432
Yes, well, I didn't want
to talk to Lomanitz

1750
01:19:58.465 --> 01:20:00.000
without authorization.

1751
01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:01.235
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1752
01:20:01.268 --> 01:20:03.237
It's something
a little bit more...

1753
01:20:04.271 --> 01:20:06.040
...well, in my opinion,
more serious.

1754
01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:09.009
Now, when the FBI pointed out
that such information

1755
01:20:09.043 --> 01:20:10.578
wouldn't be admissible in court,
Pash made it clear

1756
01:20:10.612 --> 01:20:14.381
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

1757
01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:15.983
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1758
01:20:16.016 --> 01:20:17.585
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1759
01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:20.321
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1760
01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:23.057
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

1761
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:26.994
A man attached
to the Soviet Consul

1762
01:20:27.027 --> 01:20:30.064
indicated,
through intermediate people,

1763
01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:31.633
to people on this project,

1764
01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:35.102
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

1765
01:20:35.135 --> 01:20:37.971
Oh, why would anyone
on the project want to do that?

1766
01:20:39.406 --> 01:20:41.942
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1767
01:20:41.975 --> 01:20:44.378
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians--

1768
01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:46.280
they're our allies after all--

1769
01:20:46.313 --> 01:20:49.216
but I don't like the idea of it
going out the back door.

1770
01:20:49.249 --> 01:20:51.985
It might not hurt
to be on the lookout for it.

1771
01:20:53.387 --> 01:20:54.556
And you said that to Pash?

1772
01:20:54.589 --> 01:20:56.090
I was trying to put it

1773
01:20:56.123 --> 01:20:58.959
in a context
of Russia's not Germany.

1774
01:20:58.992 --> 01:21:03.397
Boris Pash is the son
of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1775
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:06.934
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

1776
01:21:06.967 --> 01:21:08.402
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1777
01:21:08.435 --> 01:21:10.605
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

1778
01:21:10.638 --> 01:21:14.108
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1779
01:21:14.141 --> 01:21:16.176
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1780
01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.412
Would you be
a little more specific?

1781
01:21:19.681 --> 01:21:21.248
(smacks lips)

1782
01:21:21.281 --> 01:21:24.151
There's a man whose name
was mentioned to me

1783
01:21:24.184 --> 01:21:26.286
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1784
01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:30.424
Uh, I believe he's a chemist
who works at Shell.

1785
01:21:30.457 --> 01:21:32.993
He talked to a friend of his

1786
01:21:33.026 --> 01:21:36.930
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

1787
01:21:38.165 --> 01:21:40.602
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

1788
01:21:40.635 --> 01:21:43.170
I was attempting
to give them Eltenton

1789
01:21:43.203 --> 01:21:44.539
without opening a can of worms.

1790
01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:46.541
I told them
a cock-and-bull story.

1791
01:21:46.574 --> 01:21:48.108
Did you lie
to General Groves too?

1792
01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:51.679
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1793
01:21:51.713 --> 01:21:53.147
GARRISON:
Do you recall this conversation

1794
01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.583
-about the Chevalier incident?
-(scoffs)

1795
01:21:55.617 --> 01:21:58.018
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

1796
01:21:58.051 --> 01:21:59.219
Wasn't confused before,

1797
01:21:59.253 --> 01:22:00.688
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

1798
01:22:00.722 --> 01:22:02.022
GARRISON:
And what was your conclusion?

1799
01:22:02.055 --> 01:22:04.425
That he was under
the influence of

1800
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.327
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

1801
01:22:07.361 --> 01:22:10.964
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1802
01:22:10.998 --> 01:22:13.033
Well, now.

1803
01:22:13.066 --> 01:22:15.502
Might we know through whom
the contact was made?

1804
01:22:15.537 --> 01:22:17.739
That would in... involve people

1805
01:22:17.772 --> 01:22:19.741
who are not to be
involved in this.

1806
01:22:19.774 --> 01:22:22.544
Is that someone
a member of the project?

1807
01:22:22.577 --> 01:22:27.114
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1808
01:22:27.147 --> 01:22:28.248
Ah.

1809
01:22:28.282 --> 01:22:30.050
So Eltenton made his approach

1810
01:22:30.083 --> 01:22:33.320
through a member of
the faculty here at Berkeley?

1811
01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:37.525
As far as I know.
As far as I know, yes.

1812
01:22:37.559 --> 01:22:40.194
But there-there may have been

1813
01:22:40.227 --> 01:22:42.963
more than one person involved.

1814
01:22:46.366 --> 01:22:49.571
Gentlemen, if I...
if I seem uncooperative,

1815
01:22:49.604 --> 01:22:52.540
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

1816
01:22:52.574 --> 01:22:55.175
in not getting
innocent people into trouble.

1817
01:22:55.209 --> 01:22:57.010
GROVES: <i>You're trying</i>
<i>to protect your friend.</i>

1818
01:22:57.044 --> 01:22:58.278
Who's protecting you?

1819
01:22:58.312 --> 01:22:59.714
Well, you could.

1820
01:22:59.747 --> 01:23:01.081
If you gave me the name.

1821
01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:03.050
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1822
01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:04.117
That's a mistake, Robert.

1823
01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:05.986
You need to volunteer this name.

1824
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:08.489
ROBB:
<i>And did he give you the name?</i>

1825
01:23:08.523 --> 01:23:09.657
GROVES:
<i>He did.</i>

1826
01:23:09.691 --> 01:23:11.158
-ROBB: But not then, did he?
-No.

1827
01:23:11.191 --> 01:23:12.660
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1828
01:23:12.694 --> 01:23:14.596
It was.

1829
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:15.730
You see me as persistent.

1830
01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:17.498
Well, you are...

1831
01:23:17.532 --> 01:23:19.366
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

1832
01:23:19.399 --> 01:23:23.103
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1833
01:23:23.136 --> 01:23:25.138
PASH: Instead of us going
on certain steps,

1834
01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:27.274
which may come
to your attention...

1835
01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:30.410
...and be disturbing to you,

1836
01:23:30.444 --> 01:23:33.548
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1837
01:23:33.581 --> 01:23:35.082
I'm not formulating a plan.

1838
01:23:35.115 --> 01:23:37.451
I'll just have to digest
the whole thing.

1839
01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:43.791
ROBB: <i>In the months</i>
<i>in between your interview</i>

1840
01:23:43.825 --> 01:23:47.461
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

1841
01:23:47.494 --> 01:23:48.796
did you expend resources

1842
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:50.297
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

1843
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:52.800
Considerable resources, yes.

1844
01:23:52.834 --> 01:23:55.068
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

1845
01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:56.538
And when did you
receive the name?

1846
01:23:56.571 --> 01:23:57.805
I was gone by the time

1847
01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:00.274
-Oppenheimer finally
offered it up. -Gone?

1848
01:24:00.307 --> 01:24:02.476
They felt my time would be
better spent in Europe

1849
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:05.245
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1850
01:24:05.279 --> 01:24:06.446
Who did?

1851
01:24:07.549 --> 01:24:09.283
General Groves.

1852
01:24:09.316 --> 01:24:11.084
He transferred me to London.

1853
01:24:17.525 --> 01:24:19.627
SERBER: <i>It's a little early</i>
<i>for a Christmas party.</i>

1854
01:24:19.661 --> 01:24:21.663
Something's up.

1855
01:24:21.696 --> 01:24:23.731
Tolman's been away.

1856
01:24:23.765 --> 01:24:25.465
Where?

1857
01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:27.067
Ruth won't tell.

1858
01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:31.573
(lively chatter and laughter)

1859
01:24:31.606 --> 01:24:32.607
Hey!

1860
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.341
(playing upbeat music)

1861
01:24:36.778 --> 01:24:38.312
Come on, Ruthie.

1862
01:24:38.345 --> 01:24:40.414
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1863
01:24:40.447 --> 01:24:43.183
RUTH:
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1864
01:24:43.216 --> 01:24:44.586
What makes you think
I know where he is anyway?

1865
01:24:44.619 --> 01:24:46.320
ROBERT:
'Cause you do a pretty good job

1866
01:24:46.353 --> 01:24:49.122
of knowing where Mr. Tolman is
when it counts.

1867
01:24:49.156 --> 01:24:50.692
Like now?

1868
01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:54.161
GROVES:
Attention!

1869
01:24:54.194 --> 01:24:56.096
(chatter and music subside)

1870
01:24:57.364 --> 01:24:59.299
Early Christmas present
for you all.

1871
01:25:00.702 --> 01:25:03.503
(applause)

1872
01:25:03.538 --> 01:25:06.106
(crowd cheering)

1873
01:25:07.374 --> 01:25:09.744
BOHR: <i>The British pilots</i>
<i>put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1874
01:25:09.777 --> 01:25:11.779
Showed me the-the oxygen,
you know,

1875
01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:13.548
-but I messed it up.
-(crowd laughs)

1876
01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:16.183
Uh, when they opened me up
in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1877
01:25:16.216 --> 01:25:18.418
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

1878
01:25:18.452 --> 01:25:19.353
(crowd laughing)

1879
01:25:19.386 --> 01:25:20.822
Please enjoy your party.

1880
01:25:20.855 --> 01:25:22.155
(light applause)

1881
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:23.490
(whispering):
Is it big enough?

1882
01:25:23.524 --> 01:25:24.792
To end the war?

1883
01:25:24.826 --> 01:25:27.729
To end all war.

1884
01:25:29.262 --> 01:25:30.531
(intriguing music playing)

1885
01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:34.636
Uh, Heisenberg sought me out
in Copenhagen.

1886
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:36.403
It was chilling,

1887
01:25:36.436 --> 01:25:38.472
my old student
working for the Nazis.

1888
01:25:38.506 --> 01:25:42.409
He told me some things
to draw me out.

1889
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:46.648
Sustained fission reactions
in uranium.

1890
01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:48.883
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1891
01:25:48.916 --> 01:25:50.350
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1892
01:25:50.384 --> 01:25:52.654
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

1893
01:25:52.687 --> 01:25:54.388
As a moderator?

1894
01:25:54.421 --> 01:25:55.790
Yes, instead of graphite.

1895
01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:58.158
-(Teller snorts)
-(laughter)

1896
01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:00.193
What?

1897
01:26:00.227 --> 01:26:02.396
He took a wrong turn.

1898
01:26:02.429 --> 01:26:04.899
We're ahead. And with you here
to help us, Niels.

1899
01:26:04.932 --> 01:26:07.200
Sorry, could you...

1900
01:26:07.234 --> 01:26:10.170
could you give us a moment,
gentlemen?

1901
01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:18.880
I am not here to help, Robert.

1902
01:26:18.913 --> 01:26:20.815
I knew you could
do this without me.

1903
01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:21.949
Then why did you come?

1904
01:26:21.983 --> 01:26:23.417
BOHR:
To talk about after.

1905
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:25.419
The power you're about to reveal

1906
01:26:25.452 --> 01:26:27.655
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1907
01:26:28.723 --> 01:26:30.323
And the world is not prepared.

1908
01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:31.759
"You could lift the stone

1909
01:26:31.793 --> 01:26:34.428
without being ready
for the snake that's revealed."

1910
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:35.830
We have to make
the politicians understand,

1911
01:26:35.863 --> 01:26:37.965
this isn't a new weapon.

1912
01:26:37.999 --> 01:26:39.466
It's a new world.

1913
01:26:39.499 --> 01:26:42.870
I'll be out there
doing what I can, but you...

1914
01:26:42.904 --> 01:26:45.472
you're an American Prometheus.

1915
01:26:45.506 --> 01:26:47.742
The man who gave them the power

1916
01:26:47.775 --> 01:26:49.811
to destroy themselves,

1917
01:26:49.844 --> 01:26:51.478
and they'll respect that.

1918
01:26:51.512 --> 01:26:53.681
And your work really begins.

1919
01:26:57.618 --> 01:27:00.755
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1920
01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:04.625
From San Francisco.

1921
01:27:04.659 --> 01:27:06.728
(somber music playing)

1922
01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:12.600
Robert!

1923
01:27:15.837 --> 01:27:17.370
Robert?

1924
01:27:18.039 --> 01:27:20.608
Robert. Robert.

1925
01:27:20.641 --> 01:27:22.844
-God, what's the matter?
-(grunts softly)

1926
01:27:22.877 --> 01:27:24.645
-What happened?
-(sighs)

1927
01:27:25.513 --> 01:27:27.447
ROBERT:
Her father called.

1928
01:27:27.481 --> 01:27:29.617
They found her yesterday
in the bath.

1929
01:27:30.618 --> 01:27:31.753
Who?

1930
01:27:32.754 --> 01:27:34.756
She'd taken pills.

1931
01:27:34.789 --> 01:27:36.691
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1932
01:27:37.692 --> 01:27:38.659
She took barbiturates,

1933
01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:40.628
but there was chloral hydrate
in her blood.

1934
01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:42.029
(muffled screaming)

1935
01:27:42.063 --> 01:27:43.965
(screaming stops)

1936
01:27:43.998 --> 01:27:45.332
There was a note.

1937
01:27:45.365 --> 01:27:47.668
(whispering):
Jean Tatlock?

1938
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.442
We were together.

1939
01:27:55.475 --> 01:27:58.278
She said she needed me. I...

1940
01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.316
I told her I... I wouldn't...
(shudders)

1941
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:04.986
I told her I couldn't...

1942
01:28:05.019 --> 01:28:06.687
No, it was... it was me.

1943
01:28:08.488 --> 01:28:09.657
(Kitty breathing heavily)

1944
01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.793
You don't get to commit the sin

1945
01:28:11.826 --> 01:28:13.628
and then have us all
feel sorry for you

1946
01:28:13.661 --> 01:28:16.531
that it had consequences.
(breath shuddering)

1947
01:28:18.599 --> 01:28:20.802
-You pull yourself together.
-(sniffling)

1948
01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:26.607
You know,
people here depend on you.

1949
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:30.578
SERBER:
Donald, would you like

1950
01:28:30.611 --> 01:28:31.679
to contribute here?
Please, help me out.

1951
01:28:31.712 --> 01:28:32.914
HORNIG:
You're on your own, pal.

1952
01:28:32.947 --> 01:28:34.048
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

1953
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.415
because plutonium
is radioactive.

1954
01:28:35.448 --> 01:28:36.984
We just don't know
what it might do

1955
01:28:37.018 --> 01:28:38.753
to the female
reproductive system...

1956
01:28:38.786 --> 01:28:40.688
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

1957
01:28:40.721 --> 01:28:43.591
Can we please? The implosion
device is nowhere.

1958
01:28:43.624 --> 01:28:45.026
Hey, you can't rush everything.

1959
01:28:45.059 --> 01:28:46.594
-Oppie, please.
-Well, there's rushing

1960
01:28:46.627 --> 01:28:48.428
and there's getting on
with it, so pick one.

1961
01:28:48.461 --> 01:28:50.463
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1962
01:28:50.497 --> 01:28:51.431
Teller's not helping.

1963
01:28:51.464 --> 01:28:53.000
You're not helping.

1964
01:28:53.034 --> 01:28:54.434
I've been asking
for calculations

1965
01:28:54.467 --> 01:28:55.603
on the implosion lenses
for weeks.

1966
01:28:55.636 --> 01:28:57.104
The British can do it. Fuchs.

1967
01:28:57.138 --> 01:28:58.438
Absolutely.

1968
01:28:58.471 --> 01:28:59.841
It's your job, Teller.

1969
01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:01.676
I'm engaged in research.

1970
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:04.377
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1971
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:05.847
(others laughing)

1972
01:29:12.485 --> 01:29:13.855
I won't work for that man.

1973
01:29:13.888 --> 01:29:15.590
(others exclaim)

1974
01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:17.725
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1975
01:29:17.758 --> 01:29:19.994
SERBER: I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.

1976
01:29:20.027 --> 01:29:21.529
Okay.

1977
01:29:21.562 --> 01:29:23.430
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

1978
01:29:23.463 --> 01:29:24.866
Seth, I'm putting you
on plutonium.

1979
01:29:24.899 --> 01:29:28.002
Lilli, you go work for Kisty.
Because he needs you.

1980
01:29:28.035 --> 01:29:30.605
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1981
01:29:30.638 --> 01:29:33.007
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1982
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.811
And no one is leaving
Los Alamos.

1983
01:29:36.844 --> 01:29:39.580
(rousing music playing)

1984
01:29:51.058 --> 01:29:53.027
-They won't let me leave.
-ROBERT: No.

1985
01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.662
I won't let you leave.

1986
01:29:55.529 --> 01:29:58.633
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1987
01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:01.802
Stay here,
research what you want.

1988
01:30:01.836 --> 01:30:04.437
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb,
whatever.

1989
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:05.640
We'll meet to discuss.

1990
01:30:05.673 --> 01:30:07.141
You don't have time to meet.

1991
01:30:07.174 --> 01:30:08.743
You're a politician now, Robert.

1992
01:30:08.776 --> 01:30:11.411
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1993
01:30:12.246 --> 01:30:14.048
Once a week.

1994
01:30:14.081 --> 01:30:15.950
One hour. You and me.

1995
01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:23.691
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1996
01:30:27.628 --> 01:30:30.064
ROBB: <i>So the Super</i>
<i>was under development</i>

1997
01:30:30.097 --> 01:30:32.066
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1998
01:30:32.099 --> 01:30:33.601
Yes.

1999
01:30:33.634 --> 01:30:35.502
ROBB:
And yet, after the war,

2000
01:30:35.536 --> 01:30:37.138
you tried to deny it was viable.

2001
01:30:37.171 --> 01:30:38.673
No, no, no. I...

2002
01:30:38.706 --> 01:30:40.541
I pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

2003
01:30:40.574 --> 01:30:42.209
You... Didn't you try
to kill it at the AEC meeting

2004
01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:43.811
-after the Russian bomb test?
-No.

2005
01:30:43.844 --> 01:30:45.947
ROBB: But that was
the recommendation of the AEC,

2006
01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.249
-was it not?
-After hours of discussion

2007
01:30:48.282 --> 01:30:50.551
<i>about the best response.</i>

2008
01:30:50.584 --> 01:30:55.690
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

2009
01:30:56.857 --> 01:31:00.628
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

2010
01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:02.763
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

2011
01:31:02.797 --> 01:31:05.099
Izzy, draw some circles
on this side of the map

2012
01:31:05.132 --> 01:31:06.767
where they would target us.

2013
01:31:06.801 --> 01:31:08.836
-Starting with New York. D.C.
-RABI: That's fair.

2014
01:31:08.869 --> 01:31:11.639
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

2015
01:31:11.672 --> 01:31:13.207
-Deterrence.
-BUSH: "Deterrence"?

2016
01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.842
Do we really need
more deterrence

2017
01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:17.278
than our current arsenal
of atomic bombs?

2018
01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:20.014
Y-You drown in ten feet
of water or-or 10,000,

2019
01:31:20.047 --> 01:31:21.716
-what's the difference?
-(rhythmic stomping)

2020
01:31:21.749 --> 01:31:23.718
We can already drown Russia.
They know it.

2021
01:31:23.751 --> 01:31:26.020
-And now they can drown us.
-So we're just escalating...

2022
01:31:26.053 --> 01:31:27.855
(stomping intensifying)

2023
01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:30.091
(discussion continues
indistinctly)

2024
01:31:33.928 --> 01:31:35.529
(stomping stops)

2025
01:31:36.931 --> 01:31:39.767
As I said,
Teller's designs are still as

2026
01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.736
impractical as they were
during the war.

2027
01:31:41.769 --> 01:31:44.739
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

2028
01:31:44.772 --> 01:31:45.906
I don't believe we should commit

2029
01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.842
all our resources
to that chance.

2030
01:31:47.875 --> 01:31:50.745
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

2031
01:31:50.778 --> 01:31:52.980
Simply by limiting the spread
of atomic weapons

2032
01:31:53.014 --> 01:31:56.317
through international control
on nuclear energy.

2033
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.918
By which you mean
world government?

2034
01:31:57.952 --> 01:32:00.888
The United Nations
as Roosevelt intended.

2035
01:32:00.921 --> 01:32:03.824
Well, I... I asked what Truman
should do, right?

2036
01:32:03.858 --> 01:32:06.761
The world's changed,
it's not fascism but Communism

2037
01:32:06.794 --> 01:32:08.262
that now threatens our survival.

2038
01:32:08.295 --> 01:32:11.932
Lewis, do you understand,
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

2039
01:32:11.966 --> 01:32:14.835
the Russians will have no choice
but to build their own?

2040
01:32:14.869 --> 01:32:16.637
Could they be working
on one already?

2041
01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:19.173
Based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos.

2042
01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:20.674
No spy at Los Alamos.

2043
01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:21.776
-Gentlemen.
-There wasn't?

2044
01:32:21.809 --> 01:32:23.044
Let's not get sidetracked.

2045
01:32:23.077 --> 01:32:24.779
I say we use this moment

2046
01:32:24.812 --> 01:32:26.213
to gain concessions
from the Russians

2047
01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:29.316
by committing that we will not
build a hydrogen bomb.

2048
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:30.985
Thereby revealing its existence.

2049
01:32:31.018 --> 01:32:33.020
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

2050
01:32:33.054 --> 01:32:34.655
(clears throat) All right.

2051
01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:36.791
At this point, I'd like
the committee members

2052
01:32:36.824 --> 01:32:40.761
to meet in privacy to finalize
our recommendations.

2053
01:32:41.896 --> 01:32:43.898
I'm just not sure you want
to go down this road.

2054
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:46.200
Lewis, with respect,
we are the advisory committee,

2055
01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:48.002
we will give them our advice.

2056
01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:49.136
STRAUSS:
Good night.

2057
01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:57.611
Dr. Oppenheimer?
Hi. William Borden.

2058
01:32:57.645 --> 01:32:58.979
Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy?

2059
01:32:59.013 --> 01:33:00.214
Oh, yes, yes.

2060
01:33:00.247 --> 01:33:01.882
During the war, I was a pilot.

2061
01:33:03.017 --> 01:33:05.753
One night,
flying back from a raid,

2062
01:33:05.786 --> 01:33:08.689
I saw an amazing sight
like a meteor.

2063
01:33:08.722 --> 01:33:09.857
(engine rumbling)

2064
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:12.660
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

2065
01:33:12.693 --> 01:33:14.695
I can't help but imagine
what it will be

2066
01:33:14.728 --> 01:33:18.632
for such an enemy rocket
to carry an atomic warhead.

2067
01:33:18.666 --> 01:33:20.734
(rhythmic stomping)

2068
01:33:21.368 --> 01:33:22.303
(rocket engine rumbling)

2069
01:33:22.336 --> 01:33:24.905
(stomping intensifying)

2070
01:33:24.939 --> 01:33:25.806
(stomping stops)

2071
01:33:27.408 --> 01:33:28.742
Well, let's make sure
we're not the ones

2072
01:33:28.776 --> 01:33:30.077
to make that possible.

2073
01:33:36.784 --> 01:33:39.687
Oppie, I don't think you want
to go up against Strauss.

2074
01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.789
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

2075
01:33:41.822 --> 01:33:43.891
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

2076
01:33:43.924 --> 01:33:45.893
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

2077
01:33:45.926 --> 01:33:47.728
They'll listen to a prophet.

2078
01:33:47.761 --> 01:33:51.031
A prophet can't be wrong.
Not once.

2079
01:33:51.065 --> 01:33:52.833
SENATOR McGEE:
<i>Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

2080
01:33:52.867 --> 01:33:54.768
<i>of sabotaging the development</i>
<i>of the Super?</i>

2081
01:33:54.802 --> 01:33:56.403
I was never one of those

2082
01:33:56.437 --> 01:33:59.707
to bandy around terms
like "sabotage."

2083
01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.709
SENATOR McGEE:
<i>But Mr. Borden was?</i>

2084
01:34:01.742 --> 01:34:03.010
As I understand it, possibly.

2085
01:34:03.043 --> 01:34:05.146
How was Mr. Borden able
to put together

2086
01:34:05.179 --> 01:34:06.447
such a detailed indictment?

2087
01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.015
<i>He was no longer</i>
<i>a government employee,</i>

2088
01:34:08.048 --> 01:34:10.684
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

2089
01:34:10.718 --> 01:34:12.219
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

2090
01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:15.156
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have</i>
<i>given him access to the file?</i>

2091
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:17.091
Or someone else, at the AEC?

2092
01:34:17.124 --> 01:34:19.960
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

2093
01:34:19.994 --> 01:34:22.463
Is it your intention to
suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

2094
01:34:22.496 --> 01:34:24.431
is disloyal
to the United States?

2095
01:34:24.465 --> 01:34:27.001
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

2096
01:34:27.034 --> 01:34:29.737
that he's loyal
to the United States.

2097
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:31.205
I believe this.
And I shall believe it

2098
01:34:31.238 --> 01:34:34.041
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

2099
01:34:34.074 --> 01:34:35.843
ROBB:
<i>Do you or do you not believe</i>

2100
01:34:35.876 --> 01:34:38.245
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer</i>
<i>is a security risk?</i>

2101
01:34:39.346 --> 01:34:41.815
(suspenseful music plays)

2102
01:34:46.453 --> 01:34:48.088
PHILIP MORRISON:
And if I may,

2103
01:34:48.122 --> 01:34:50.925
when Hitler blew
his brains out in that bunker,

2104
01:34:50.958 --> 01:34:52.493
it's my humble opinion
that there is no need

2105
01:34:52.527 --> 01:34:53.994
for that bomb
to be seen anywhere

2106
01:34:54.028 --> 01:34:55.796
-except for that test site.
-(applause)

2107
01:34:55.829 --> 01:34:57.831
HORNIG: But we at least
have to take a moment

2108
01:34:57.865 --> 01:34:59.867
to think about whether the means

2109
01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.169
justify the ends
any longer, because...

2110
01:35:04.505 --> 01:35:07.074
Germany is about to surrender.

2111
01:35:07.107 --> 01:35:08.943
(applause)

2112
01:35:08.976 --> 01:35:12.313
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat

2113
01:35:12.346 --> 01:35:14.148
to mankind, it's our work.

2114
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:15.849
(people murmur)

2115
01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:19.286
Hitler's dead, it's true.

2116
01:35:20.988 --> 01:35:22.524
But the Japanese fight on.

2117
01:35:22.557 --> 01:35:24.225
Their defeat seems assured.

2118
01:35:24.258 --> 01:35:27.261
Not if you're a G.I.
preparing to invade.

2119
01:35:28.563 --> 01:35:29.863
We can end this war.

2120
01:35:29.897 --> 01:35:31.298
MORRISON:
But how do we justify

2121
01:35:31.332 --> 01:35:32.900
using this weapon
on human beings?

2122
01:35:32.933 --> 01:35:34.868
-(murmurs of assent)
-(scattered applause)

2123
01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:39.340
We're theorists, yes?

2124
01:35:39.373 --> 01:35:40.975
PEOPLE:
Yes. Yep.

2125
01:35:41.008 --> 01:35:45.045
We imagine a future
and our imaginings horrify us.

2126
01:35:46.113 --> 01:35:48.249
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

2127
01:35:48.282 --> 01:35:51.185
and they won't understand it
until they've used it.

2128
01:35:51.218 --> 01:35:52.386
When the world learns

2129
01:35:52.419 --> 01:35:54.922
the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

2130
01:35:54.955 --> 01:35:58.392
our work here will ensure
a peace mankind has never seen.

2131
01:35:58.425 --> 01:36:01.795
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

2132
01:36:01.829 --> 01:36:03.864
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

2133
01:36:03.897 --> 01:36:06.000
(scattered applause)

2134
01:36:08.969 --> 01:36:10.204
ROBERT:
<i>Progress?</i>

2135
01:36:10.237 --> 01:36:13.007
Two years and
a billion dollars' worth?

2136
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.808
Well, hard to put a price on it.

2137
01:36:14.842 --> 01:36:16.410
Not really,
just add up the bills.

2138
01:36:16.443 --> 01:36:18.145
"Rural free deliveries."

2139
01:36:18.178 --> 01:36:20.948
Eighty babies delivered
the first year.

2140
01:36:20.981 --> 01:36:23.317
This year,
we've had ten a month.

2141
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:26.086
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

2142
01:36:26.954 --> 01:36:29.290
-GROVES: Clearly.
-KITTY: General.

2143
01:36:29.323 --> 01:36:31.225
(thrilling music playing)

2144
01:36:34.261 --> 01:36:35.597
Head down, everyone.

2145
01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:37.798
Fuchs, head down.

2146
01:36:40.301 --> 01:36:41.468
Hmm? (sniffs)

2147
01:36:41.502 --> 01:36:42.503
(spool winds)

2148
01:36:42.537 --> 01:36:44.305
(explosion)

2149
01:36:44.338 --> 01:36:46.073
That's the one. (grunts)

2150
01:36:46.106 --> 01:36:49.009
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

2151
01:36:51.312 --> 01:36:53.147
September.

2152
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.181
July.

2153
01:36:54.214 --> 01:36:56.150
That's the sweet spot,
gentlemen.

2154
01:36:56.183 --> 01:36:58.352
August.

2155
01:36:58.385 --> 01:37:00.120
July.

2156
01:37:00.154 --> 01:37:01.955
Test in July.

2157
01:37:01.989 --> 01:37:03.625
But I need my brother.

2158
01:37:03.658 --> 01:37:06.160
(thrilling music continues)

2159
01:37:07.995 --> 01:37:09.930
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

2160
01:37:09.963 --> 01:37:12.399
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

2161
01:37:19.373 --> 01:37:21.208
What do we call the test?

2162
01:37:22.309 --> 01:37:26.080
"Batter my heart,
three-person'd god."

2163
01:37:26.113 --> 01:37:27.214
What?

2164
01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:29.983
Trinity.

2165
01:37:37.659 --> 01:37:39.026
ROBB:
You insisted

2166
01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:40.361
on bringing on
your brother Frank,

2167
01:37:40.394 --> 01:37:41.995
-a known Communist.
-A former Communist.

2168
01:37:42.029 --> 01:37:44.465
You brought a known
former Communist

2169
01:37:44.498 --> 01:37:48.369
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

2170
01:37:48.402 --> 01:37:51.505
I knew my brother
could be trusted. Absolutely.

2171
01:37:51.539 --> 01:37:53.508
And you felt
your judgment was sound

2172
01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:55.376
on who on the team
could be trusted?

2173
01:37:56.377 --> 01:37:57.512
Fuchs, head down.

2174
01:37:57.545 --> 01:37:59.279
Okay, everybody ready?

2175
01:38:00.648 --> 01:38:02.584
Hmm? (sniffs)

2176
01:38:02.617 --> 01:38:04.385
-(spool winds)
-Oh.

2177
01:38:04.418 --> 01:38:06.019
(explosion)

2178
01:38:07.522 --> 01:38:08.656
Oh.

2179
01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.424
Well, I hope
you learned something.

2180
01:38:10.457 --> 01:38:12.359
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

2181
01:38:12.393 --> 01:38:13.961
Well, figure it out. Fast.

2182
01:38:13.994 --> 01:38:15.663
We leave for Washington
in the morning.

2183
01:38:15.697 --> 01:38:17.898
We're gonna give them a date.

2184
01:38:23.437 --> 01:38:25.139
(telephones ringing)

2185
01:38:32.045 --> 01:38:33.715
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

2186
01:38:33.748 --> 01:38:35.249
If we don't act now,

2187
01:38:35.282 --> 01:38:36.984
they're going to use
this thing against Japan.

2188
01:38:37.017 --> 01:38:38.986
We booked a meeting with Truman,

2189
01:38:39.019 --> 01:38:40.287
but somebody killed it.

2190
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.189
You're meeting
the Secretary of War.

2191
01:38:42.222 --> 01:38:44.391
Just because we're building it,

2192
01:38:44.425 --> 01:38:46.427
doesn't mean we get to decide
how it's used.

2193
01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.229
History will judge us, Robert.

2194
01:38:49.263 --> 01:38:52.567
In Chicago,
we put together a petition.

2195
01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.536
I'm not...
I'm not getting into that.

2196
01:38:54.569 --> 01:38:56.303
(clattering)

2197
01:38:56.336 --> 01:38:58.038
(sighs)

2198
01:38:59.607 --> 01:39:01.543
Just tell me your concerns,
and I'll relay them.

2199
01:39:01.576 --> 01:39:02.677
My concerns?

2200
01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:04.679
Germany's defeated.

2201
01:39:04.712 --> 01:39:06.480
Japan's not going
to hold out alone.

2202
01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:08.415
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

2203
01:39:08.449 --> 01:39:10.217
You and Einstein
with your letter to Roosevelt

2204
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:13.053
-saying we could build a bomb.
-(scoffs) Against Germany.

2205
01:39:13.086 --> 01:39:16.023
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

2206
01:39:16.056 --> 01:39:17.191
SZILARD:
Oppie, you have to help.

2207
01:39:17.224 --> 01:39:18.526
ROBERT:
Fermi's in the meeting.

2208
01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.127
-Lawrence is in the meeting.
-They're not you.

2209
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.329
You're the great salesman
of science.

2210
01:39:22.362 --> 01:39:24.965
You can convince
anyone of anything.

2211
01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:27.067
Even yourself.

2212
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:29.069
'Scuse me.

2213
01:39:30.103 --> 01:39:33.373
The firestorm in Tokyo killed
100,000 people.

2214
01:39:33.407 --> 01:39:35.209
Mostly civilians.

2215
01:39:35.242 --> 01:39:37.779
I worry about an America
where we do these things

2216
01:39:37.812 --> 01:39:39.547
and no one protests.

2217
01:39:39.581 --> 01:39:42.617
Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific

2218
01:39:42.650 --> 01:39:45.185
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

2219
01:39:45.219 --> 01:39:47.254
STIMSON: Enough to unleash
the atomic bomb?

2220
01:39:47.287 --> 01:39:49.156
FERMI:
Uh, the A-bomb might not cause

2221
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:51.091
as much damage
as the Tokyo bombings.

2222
01:39:51.124 --> 01:39:52.493
What are we estimating?

2223
01:39:52.527 --> 01:39:55.362
In a medium-size city, uh,

2224
01:39:55.395 --> 01:39:56.798
20 or 30,000 dead.

2225
01:39:56.831 --> 01:39:58.633
ROBERT:
Yes, but, uh,

2226
01:39:58.666 --> 01:40:01.703
don't underestimate
the psychological impact of a...

2227
01:40:01.736 --> 01:40:03.136
of an atomic explosion.

2228
01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:07.407
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

2229
01:40:07.441 --> 01:40:10.778
Deadly neutron effects
for a mile, in all directions,

2230
01:40:10.812 --> 01:40:13.715
from one single device.

2231
01:40:13.748 --> 01:40:16.083
Dropped from
a barely noticed B-29,

2232
01:40:16.116 --> 01:40:18.385
the atomic bomb will be

2233
01:40:18.418 --> 01:40:21.255
a terrible revelation
of divine power.

2234
01:40:21.288 --> 01:40:24.559
If that's true,
it would be definitive.

2235
01:40:24.592 --> 01:40:26.661
World War II would be over.

2236
01:40:26.694 --> 01:40:28.395
Our boys would come home.

2237
01:40:28.428 --> 01:40:29.564
Military targets?

2238
01:40:30.698 --> 01:40:33.367
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

2239
01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:39.172
Perhaps a vital war plant
with workers housed nearby.

2240
01:40:39.206 --> 01:40:41.543
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

2241
01:40:41.576 --> 01:40:43.745
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

2242
01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:45.379
and I'd be up in that plane.

2243
01:40:45.412 --> 01:40:48.616
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

2244
01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:51.351
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

2245
01:40:51.385 --> 01:40:54.488
Is there no way to demonstrate
a bomb to Japan

2246
01:40:54.522 --> 01:40:56.223
to provoke surrender?

2247
01:40:56.256 --> 01:40:59.326
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms.

2248
01:40:59.359 --> 01:41:00.060
Twice.

2249
01:41:00.093 --> 01:41:02.162
Once to show the weapon's power

2250
01:41:02.195 --> 01:41:04.699
and a second to show
that we can keep doing this

2251
01:41:04.732 --> 01:41:06.233
until they surrender.

2252
01:41:06.266 --> 01:41:09.637
We have a list of 12 cities
to choose from...

2253
01:41:09.671 --> 01:41:11.573
Sorry, 11.

2254
01:41:11.606 --> 01:41:13.307
I've taken Kyoto off the list

2255
01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:17.144
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

2256
01:41:17.177 --> 01:41:19.814
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

2257
01:41:19.847 --> 01:41:21.348
It's a magnificent city.

2258
01:41:24.919 --> 01:41:26.621
Let me make this
simple for you, gentlemen.

2259
01:41:26.654 --> 01:41:29.156
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

2260
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:31.626
the Japanese people
will not surrender

2261
01:41:31.659 --> 01:41:33.427
under any circumstances

2262
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.864
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

2263
01:41:36.898 --> 01:41:39.867
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

2264
01:41:39.901 --> 01:41:42.135
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities

2265
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:44.137
will save lives.

2266
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:46.473
If we retain moral advantage.

2267
01:41:46.507 --> 01:41:48.643
-How so?
-Well, if we use this weapon

2268
01:41:48.676 --> 01:41:51.613
without informing our allies,
they'll see it as a threat.

2269
01:41:51.646 --> 01:41:52.814
And we'll be in an arms race.

2270
01:41:52.847 --> 01:41:54.916
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

2271
01:41:54.949 --> 01:41:56.517
BUSH:
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets

2272
01:41:56.551 --> 01:41:58.920
from becoming part
of the atomic world.

2273
01:41:58.953 --> 01:42:01.254
We've been told
they have no uranium.

2274
01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:02.489
You've been misinformed.

2275
01:42:02.523 --> 01:42:04.358
A Russian bomb
is a matter of time.

2276
01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:07.795
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

2277
01:42:07.829 --> 01:42:10.430
Uh, Secretary Stimson,
if I may...

2278
01:42:10.464 --> 01:42:14.468
Not all scientists
on the project are in agreement.

2279
01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:17.371
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions.

2280
01:42:17.404 --> 01:42:19.306
-If you talk a scientist in...
-GROVES: The Manhattan Project

2281
01:42:19.339 --> 01:42:20.708
has been plagued from the start

2282
01:42:20.742 --> 01:42:24.545
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

2283
01:42:24.579 --> 01:42:25.647
and uncertain loyalty.

2284
01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.915
One of them just tried to meet
with the president.

2285
01:42:27.949 --> 01:42:29.784
Now, we need these men,

2286
01:42:29.817 --> 01:42:31.351
but as soon as it's practical,

2287
01:42:31.385 --> 01:42:33.655
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

2288
01:42:33.688 --> 01:42:35.255
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

2289
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:38.225
MARSHALL: If a Russian bomb
is inevitable,

2290
01:42:38.258 --> 01:42:41.529
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity.

2291
01:42:41.562 --> 01:42:43.865
President Truman
has no intention

2292
01:42:43.898 --> 01:42:45.465
of raising expectations

2293
01:42:45.499 --> 01:42:48.301
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

2294
01:42:48.335 --> 01:42:49.704
Informing him
of our breakthrough

2295
01:42:49.737 --> 01:42:51.338
and presenting it as a means
to win the war

2296
01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:54.274
need not make
unkeepable promises.

2297
01:42:54.307 --> 01:42:55.843
But the Potsdam
peace conference in July

2298
01:42:55.877 --> 01:42:57.779
will be President Truman's
last chance

2299
01:42:57.812 --> 01:42:59.947
to have that conversation.

2300
01:42:59.981 --> 01:43:01.883
Can you give us
a working bomb by then?

2301
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:06.587
Absolutely. We will test fire
before the conference.

2302
01:43:07.454 --> 01:43:10.290
(suspenseful music playing)

2303
01:43:11.324 --> 01:43:13.861
FRANK:
<i>Ground zero observation posts</i>

2304
01:43:13.895 --> 01:43:15.362
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

2305
01:43:15.395 --> 01:43:17.565
north, south and west.

2306
01:43:17.598 --> 01:43:20.902
-Where do we trigger from?
-Uh, south 10,000.

2307
01:43:20.935 --> 01:43:24.271
And base camp
is ten miles south, here.

2308
01:43:24.304 --> 01:43:27.240
And there's a further
observation post

2309
01:43:27.274 --> 01:43:29.443
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

2310
01:43:29.476 --> 01:43:32.446
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

2311
01:43:32.479 --> 01:43:35.983
The Air Force requested
a line of lights for their B-29.

2312
01:43:36.017 --> 01:43:38.452
What B-29?
Our bomb's on the tower.

2313
01:43:38.485 --> 01:43:39.854
FRANK:
They want to use the test

2314
01:43:39.887 --> 01:43:41.723
to confirm a safe
operating distance.

2315
01:43:41.756 --> 01:43:42.990
That's risky.

2316
01:43:43.024 --> 01:43:44.659
Not as risky as dropping one
over Japan

2317
01:43:44.692 --> 01:43:46.460
and hoping that we were right
about the blast radius.

2318
01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:48.596
Don't let them slow us down,
we're firing on the 15th.

2319
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:51.866
-The 15th? That's not...
-GROVES: The 15th.

2320
01:43:51.899 --> 01:43:54.234
The 15th.

2321
01:43:55.335 --> 01:43:57.270
ROBERT: So I'll be here
at South Observation point

2322
01:43:57.304 --> 01:43:59.507
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

2323
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:02.043
You'll all be assigned
to Base Camp,

2324
01:44:02.076 --> 01:44:05.278
West Observation
or Far Observation.

2325
01:44:05.312 --> 01:44:08.381
(suspenseful music continues)

2326
01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:16.824
Whoa, whoa.
Careful with the knife.

2327
01:44:16.858 --> 01:44:19.292
There, carefully.

2328
01:44:20.393 --> 01:44:21.929
Are those safe distances?

2329
01:44:21.963 --> 01:44:24.464
They're based
on your calculations.

2330
01:44:24.498 --> 01:44:27.400
Time to stand behind
your science, Hans. Literally.

2331
01:44:29.469 --> 01:44:31.606
(suspenseful music continues)

2332
01:44:50.825 --> 01:44:52.292
KISTIAKOWSKY:
Yeah.

2333
01:44:56.964 --> 01:44:58.800
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

2334
01:44:58.833 --> 01:45:00.067
Without high winds,

2335
01:45:00.101 --> 01:45:01.669
it should settle
within two to three miles.

2336
01:45:01.702 --> 01:45:04.105
Evacuation measures
are in place.

2337
01:45:04.138 --> 01:45:05.940
But we need good weather
for visibility,

2338
01:45:05.973 --> 01:45:07.440
so it has to be fine.

2339
01:45:08.543 --> 01:45:09.811
KISTIAKOWSKY:
Everybody out.

2340
01:45:11.078 --> 01:45:13.380
(suspenseful music continues)

2341
01:45:19.987 --> 01:45:21.122
We go on the night of the 15th.

2342
01:45:21.155 --> 01:45:23.090
It's a hard deadline,

2343
01:45:23.124 --> 01:45:26.426
so if anyone has anything,
speak now.

2344
01:45:27.128 --> 01:45:28.461
Okay, stop, stop.

2345
01:45:28.495 --> 01:45:30.363
Everybody, mattresses.

2346
01:45:30.397 --> 01:45:32.465
Put the mattress underneath.

2347
01:45:49.449 --> 01:45:52.352
Could use
a final implosion test.

2348
01:45:53.054 --> 01:45:55.022
It couldn't hurt.

2349
01:45:55.056 --> 01:45:56.557
Do it.

2350
01:45:57.525 --> 01:45:59.827
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

2351
01:45:59.861 --> 01:46:01.529
(thunder rumbling)

2352
01:46:18.045 --> 01:46:20.681
(suspenseful music continues)

2353
01:46:33.928 --> 01:46:36.831
It's happening, isn't it?

2354
01:46:37.932 --> 01:46:39.700
I'll send a message.

2355
01:46:40.568 --> 01:46:43.204
If it's gone our way,

2356
01:46:43.237 --> 01:46:44.805
take in the sheets.

2357
01:46:48.843 --> 01:46:49.877
Robert?

2358
01:46:52.546 --> 01:46:53.981
Break a leg.

2359
01:46:59.954 --> 01:47:02.123
(suspenseful music continues)

2360
01:47:02.156 --> 01:47:04.592
(explosion)

2361
01:47:07.762 --> 01:47:09.063
(mutters)

2362
01:47:09.096 --> 01:47:10.998
(wind gusting)

2363
01:47:36.223 --> 01:47:38.491
(wind whistling)

2364
01:47:43.764 --> 01:47:44.899
(sighs)

2365
01:47:52.606 --> 01:47:54.775
(thunder rumbling)

2366
01:48:00.548 --> 01:48:03.684
Oppie's taken a very modest
three kilotons.

2367
01:48:03.718 --> 01:48:06.087
-Teller's in with 45.
-RABI: 20.

2368
01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.556
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

2369
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:09.991
and does anyone want
the side action

2370
01:48:10.024 --> 01:48:12.760
-on atmospheric ignition?
-(all laughing)

2371
01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:16.664
Are you saying
we'll have to delay?

2372
01:48:16.697 --> 01:48:17.865
I'm saying it would be prudent.

2373
01:48:17.898 --> 01:48:19.133
This weather,
has it reached the site?

2374
01:48:19.166 --> 01:48:21.002
(tense music playing)

2375
01:48:21.035 --> 01:48:23.270
(thunder rumbling)

2376
01:48:23.304 --> 01:48:24.939
(telephone ringing)

2377
01:48:24.972 --> 01:48:26.941
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2378
01:48:26.974 --> 01:48:28.609
ROBERT:
Hello, Hans.

2379
01:48:28.642 --> 01:48:30.044
Yes, he's here.

2380
01:48:30.878 --> 01:48:32.213
Yes.

2381
01:48:32.246 --> 01:48:34.749
(thunder rumbling)

2382
01:48:34.782 --> 01:48:35.983
-Is he wrong?
-No.

2383
01:48:36.017 --> 01:48:37.918
-No?
-No.

2384
01:48:38.753 --> 01:48:40.321
So we're about to fire a dud?

2385
01:48:40.354 --> 01:48:41.822
-No.
-Explain.

2386
01:48:41.856 --> 01:48:44.625
Well, I can't. I just...
I-I just know.

2387
01:48:44.658 --> 01:48:46.327
I know the implosion lenses
will work.

2388
01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.762
If we fire these detonators

2389
01:48:47.795 --> 01:48:49.030
and they don't
trigger a reaction,

2390
01:48:49.063 --> 01:48:50.731
two years' worth of plutonium

2391
01:48:50.765 --> 01:48:52.166
will be scattered
across White Sands.

2392
01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:56.103
A month of my salary against
ten bucks says it lights.

2393
01:48:56.137 --> 01:48:58.139
-Jesus.
-(thunder rumbling)

2394
01:48:58.172 --> 01:49:00.674
(tense music continues)

2395
01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:06.347
WEATHERMAN: The wind's picking
up at zero, not the rain.

2396
01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:07.815
Lightning's circling.

2397
01:49:07.848 --> 01:49:09.283
You think it might be time
to tell your men

2398
01:49:09.316 --> 01:49:12.219
to get away from the steel tower
with the atomic bomb?

2399
01:49:12.253 --> 01:49:14.722
(laughter)

2400
01:49:15.356 --> 01:49:17.324
Let's get to South Observation.

2401
01:49:17.358 --> 01:49:18.826
Pull 'em out.

2402
01:49:18.859 --> 01:49:20.261
ROBERT: We can make
our determination there.

2403
01:49:20.294 --> 01:49:22.763
(tense music continues)

2404
01:49:25.666 --> 01:49:27.668
The team hasn't slept
in two nights.

2405
01:49:27.701 --> 01:49:29.703
If we stand down,
make the bomb safe,

2406
01:49:29.737 --> 01:49:31.072
we won't be back here for weeks.

2407
01:49:31.105 --> 01:49:32.773
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

2408
01:49:32.807 --> 01:49:34.708
I gotta get word
to Truman by 7:00.

2409
01:49:34.742 --> 01:49:35.976
Our window's closing.

2410
01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.078
What is this doing?

2411
01:49:37.111 --> 01:49:38.612
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2412
01:49:38.646 --> 01:49:40.681
-For how long, damn it?
-It's holdin' strong.

2413
01:49:40.714 --> 01:49:42.016
It'll break before dawn.

2414
01:49:42.049 --> 01:49:43.717
-How could you know that?
-I know this desert.

2415
01:49:43.751 --> 01:49:44.852
Storm cools overnight.

2416
01:49:44.885 --> 01:49:46.687
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

2417
01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.923
He could be right, but schedule
as late as possible.

2418
01:49:48.956 --> 01:49:50.691
5:30!

2419
01:49:50.724 --> 01:49:51.759
Sign your forecast.

2420
01:49:51.792 --> 01:49:52.860
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2421
01:49:52.893 --> 01:49:54.695
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

2422
01:49:54.728 --> 01:49:56.864
-5:30, 5:30.
-MAN: 5:30.

2423
01:49:59.066 --> 01:50:04.004
Three years,
4,000 people, $2 billion.

2424
01:50:04.038 --> 01:50:06.407
Well, if it doesn't go off...
(sighs)

2425
01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.042
we're both finished.

2426
01:50:09.110 --> 01:50:10.778
(thunder rumbling)

2427
01:50:10.811 --> 01:50:12.780
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2428
01:50:13.747 --> 01:50:15.182
Anything less,
they won't get what it is.

2429
01:50:15.216 --> 01:50:19.787
What did Fermi mean
by "atmospheric ignition"?

2430
01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:21.288
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

2431
01:50:21.322 --> 01:50:25.159
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

2432
01:50:26.393 --> 01:50:28.429
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2433
01:50:28.462 --> 01:50:30.431
Why is Fermi
still taking side bets on it?

2434
01:50:30.464 --> 01:50:33.634
Call it gallows humor.

2435
01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:38.772
Wait, are we saying
there's a chance

2436
01:50:38.806 --> 01:50:40.674
that when we push that button,

2437
01:50:40.708 --> 01:50:42.042
we destroy the world?

2438
01:50:42.076 --> 01:50:44.245
Nothing in our research
over three years

2439
01:50:44.278 --> 01:50:45.913
supports that conclusion.

2440
01:50:45.946 --> 01:50:48.916
Except as the most
remote possibility.

2441
01:50:48.949 --> 01:50:50.284
How remote?

2442
01:50:50.317 --> 01:50:51.919
Chances are near zero.

2443
01:50:53.254 --> 01:50:54.655
Near zero?

2444
01:50:55.422 --> 01:50:57.992
What do you want
from theory alone?

2445
01:50:58.025 --> 01:50:59.460
(scoffs)

2446
01:50:59.493 --> 01:51:01.862
Zero would be nice.

2447
01:51:05.166 --> 01:51:06.800
In exactly

2448
01:51:06.834 --> 01:51:10.137
one hour, 58 minutes,

2449
01:51:10.171 --> 01:51:11.705
we'll know.

2450
01:51:17.745 --> 01:51:18.946
It's letting up.

2451
01:51:20.214 --> 01:51:22.683
(tense music continues)

2452
01:51:31.825 --> 01:51:34.195
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

2453
01:51:34.228 --> 01:51:35.196
Throwing the switches.

2454
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:36.330
Turn the cars.

2455
01:51:36.363 --> 01:51:38.832
Ready for emergency evacuation.

2456
01:51:42.803 --> 01:51:45.105
(tense music continues)

2457
01:51:56.518 --> 01:51:57.751
ARMY CAPTAIN:
...welder's glass.

2458
01:51:57.785 --> 01:51:59.353
Everybody take your places.

2459
01:51:59.386 --> 01:52:01.889
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2460
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:05.259
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2461
01:52:24.845 --> 01:52:28.015
(tense music continues)

2462
01:52:54.908 --> 01:52:56.443
(timer ticking)

2463
01:52:56.477 --> 01:52:57.878
Twenty minutes.

2464
01:53:01.382 --> 01:53:03.217
Twenty minutes.

2465
01:53:14.395 --> 01:53:15.929
That's 20.

2466
01:53:18.932 --> 01:53:20.401
On the leg, please.

2467
01:53:21.935 --> 01:53:24.438
-Feynman.
-No.

2468
01:53:24.471 --> 01:53:26.440
The glass. Stops the U.V.

2469
01:53:26.473 --> 01:53:28.275
And what stops the glass?

2470
01:53:29.276 --> 01:53:32.246
I'm gonna head to base camp.
Best of luck.

2471
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.915
Robert.

2472
01:53:35.517 --> 01:53:37.351
Try not to blow up the world.

2473
01:53:40.921 --> 01:53:43.123
(tense music building)

2474
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:50.331
Watch that needle.

2475
01:53:50.364 --> 01:53:51.932
If the detonators don't charge

2476
01:53:51.965 --> 01:53:53.901
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

2477
01:53:53.934 --> 01:53:55.936
you hit that button, you abort.

2478
01:53:55.969 --> 01:53:58.272
-Understood?
-Understood.

2479
01:54:03.377 --> 01:54:04.945
(rocket hissing)

2480
01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:08.215
MAN (on speaker):
Two minutes to detonation.

2481
01:54:08.248 --> 01:54:10.217
Everybody down.

2482
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.218
Do not turn around

2483
01:54:11.251 --> 01:54:14.321
until you see light
reflected on the hills.

2484
01:54:14.355 --> 01:54:15.489
Then look at the explosion

2485
01:54:15.523 --> 01:54:17.157
only through
your welder's glass.

2486
01:54:17.191 --> 01:54:19.893
MAN (on speaker):
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2487
01:54:21.529 --> 01:54:24.365
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2488
01:54:24.398 --> 01:54:26.500
Is it rubbed in?

2489
01:54:26.534 --> 01:54:27.901
Yeah.

2490
01:54:34.241 --> 01:54:37.344
MAN (on speaker):
Sixty seconds to detonation.

2491
01:54:38.613 --> 01:54:41.382
(intense music playing)

2492
01:54:52.025 --> 01:54:54.261
These things are hard
on your heart.

2493
01:54:54.294 --> 01:54:55.996
MAN (on speaker):
Thirty seconds.

2494
01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.300
(charging up)

2495
01:55:01.101 --> 01:55:02.503
Detonators charged.

2496
01:55:03.705 --> 01:55:07.174
(intense music continues)

2497
01:55:12.647 --> 01:55:16.116
MAN (on speaker):
Seventeen, sixteen,

2498
01:55:16.150 --> 01:55:17.317
fifteen,

2499
01:55:17.351 --> 01:55:18.520

eight,

2506
01:55:30.732 --> 01:55:33.300
seven,

2507
01:55:33.333 --> 01:55:35.703
-six...
-(intense music building)

2508
01:55:35.737 --> 01:55:37.204

01:55:51.485 --> 01:55:53.987
(breathing heavily)

01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:04.264
(both gasp)

2516
01:56:06.634 --> 01:56:09.069
(exhales)

2517
01:56:09.102 --> 01:56:11.038
(whispers):
Poof.

2518
01:56:13.708 --> 01:56:15.510
(breathing heavily)

2519
01:56:29.156 --> 01:56:31.992
(faint pensive music playing)

01:57:00.822 --> 01:57:03.490
(faint pensive music continues)

2523
01:57:19.841 --> 01:57:23.210
ROBERT:
<i>"And now I am become Death.</i>

2524
01:57:25.112 --> 01:57:27.281
<i>The destroyer of worlds."</i>

2525
01:57:29.884 --> 01:57:31.318
(explosion)

2526
01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:33.287
(rumbling)

(rumbling)

2534
01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.649
FRANK:
It worked.

2535
01:58:04.284 --> 01:58:05.620
(rumbling subsides)

2536
01:58:08.856 --> 01:58:10.825
(muffled laughter)

01:58:23.938 --> 01:58:26.373
(mellow music playing)

01:58:31.378 --> 01:58:33.413
-(playing triumphant beat)

2540
01:58:35.315 --> 01:58:36.851
(whooping excitedly)

2541
01:58:36.884 --> 01:58:38.886
-You owe me ten dollars!
-Oh!

2542
01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.188
(laughs)

2543
01:58:41.221 --> 01:58:42.356
-Come on!
-Hang on.

2544
01:58:42.389 --> 01:58:43.825
I'm good for it, Kisty.

2545
01:58:43.858 --> 01:58:46.159
-(both laughing)
-You are.

2546
01:58:46.193 --> 01:58:48.896
Yes, you are! (laughs)

01:58:48.930 --> 01:58:51.633
(cheering and applauding)

2548
01:58:53.901 --> 01:58:56.269
(mellow music continues)

2549
01:59:12.987 --> 01:59:14.522
ROBERT:
Well done.

2550
01:59:16.223 --> 01:59:18.760
We did it! We did it!

2551
01:59:18.793 --> 01:59:20.695
Well done.

2552
01:59:25.499 --> 01:59:27.334
-Get me Potsdam right away.
-Yes, sir.

2553
01:59:27.367 --> 01:59:29.570
(cheering continues)

2554
01:59:38.813 --> 01:59:40.581
Get a message to Kitty.

2555
01:59:40.615 --> 01:59:41.314
We can't say anything.

2556
01:59:41.348 --> 01:59:43.283
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2557
01:59:51.291 --> 01:59:52.827
We did it, everyone!

2558
01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:55.462
-(telephone ringing)
-(baby crying)

2559
01:59:57.699 --> 01:59:59.499
(shushes) Hello?

2560
01:59:59.534 --> 02:00:01.969
-CHARLOTTE: Hi, Kitty?
-What, what? Charlotte...

2561
02:00:02.003 --> 02:00:03.370
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2562
02:00:03.403 --> 02:00:04.772
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

2563
02:00:04.806 --> 02:00:08.009
he just said to tell you
to "bring in the sheets."

2564
02:00:08.042 --> 02:00:10.678
(baby continues crying)

2565
02:00:10.712 --> 02:00:12.279
Kitty?

2566
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:15.817
Kitty?
Kitty, are you still there?

2567
02:00:22.724 --> 02:00:24.859
ROBERT: <i>If they detonate it</i>
<i>too high in the air,</i>

2568
02:00:24.892 --> 02:00:26.259
the blast won't be as powerful.

2569
02:00:26.293 --> 02:00:28.328
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2570
02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:30.397
we'll take it from here.

2571
02:00:31.766 --> 02:00:34.769
(disquieting music playing)

2572
02:00:40.641 --> 02:00:43.544
Did Truman brief Stalin
at Potsdam?

2573
02:00:43.578 --> 02:00:46.313
A brief would be
an overstatement.

2574
02:00:46.346 --> 02:00:50.417
He referred
to a powerful new weapon.

2575
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:55.523
Stalin hoped we'd use it
against Japan.

2576
02:00:56.758 --> 02:00:58.492
That's it?

2577
02:00:58.526 --> 02:01:01.763
Robert, we've given them an ace,
it's for them to play the hand.

2578
02:01:03.898 --> 02:01:06.000
You're aiming for the 6th?

2579
02:01:06.033 --> 02:01:08.335
It's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

2580
02:01:09.670 --> 02:01:11.739
Shall I come with you
to Washington?

2581
02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:14.575
What for?

2582
02:01:16.844 --> 02:01:18.445
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2583
02:01:19.781 --> 02:01:21.414
Of course.

2584
02:01:22.984 --> 02:01:24.585
As best I can.

2585
02:01:24.619 --> 02:01:26.386
(engine revs)

2586
02:01:42.003 --> 02:01:44.872
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

2587
02:01:46.107 --> 02:01:47.708
I don't know.

2588
02:01:50.111 --> 02:01:52.113
TELLER: Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

2589
02:01:52.146 --> 02:01:54.882
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

2590
02:01:54.916 --> 02:01:56.117
You're not signing it, are you?

2591
02:01:56.150 --> 02:01:59.554
Many people have.
A lot of people have.

2592
02:01:59.587 --> 02:02:00.721
Edward.

2593
02:02:01.989 --> 02:02:03.658
The fact that we built this bomb

2594
02:02:03.691 --> 02:02:06.694
does not give us any more...
any more right or responsibility

2595
02:02:06.727 --> 02:02:08.830
to decide how it's used
than anyone else.

2596
02:02:08.863 --> 02:02:10.865
But we're the only people
who know about it.

2597
02:02:10.898 --> 02:02:14.467
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2598
02:02:14.501 --> 02:02:15.903
But what's your opinion?

2599
02:02:17.138 --> 02:02:18.673
Once it's used...

2600
02:02:19.774 --> 02:02:23.476
...nuclear war,
perhaps all war...

2601
02:02:25.079 --> 02:02:26.514
...becomes unthinkable.

2602
02:02:26.547 --> 02:02:29.550
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.

2603
02:02:50.137 --> 02:02:51.873
I thought they would call.

2604
02:02:51.906 --> 02:02:53.473
It's only the 5th.

2605
02:02:55.643 --> 02:02:57.645
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2606
02:03:10.791 --> 02:03:11.792
Charlotte.

2607
02:03:14.128 --> 02:03:15.830
Try Groves.

2608
02:03:16.831 --> 02:03:17.899
<i>Anything?</i>

2609
02:03:20.201 --> 02:03:21.569
Charlotte?

2610
02:03:21.602 --> 02:03:22.904
CHARLOTTE:
Truman's on the radio.

2611
02:03:23.838 --> 02:03:26.741
TRUMAN (on radio):
Sixteen hours ago,

2612
02:03:26.774 --> 02:03:32.680
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2613
02:03:33.714 --> 02:03:36.851
...and destroyed its usefulness
to the enemy.

2614
02:03:36.884 --> 02:03:38.786
(elated laughter outside)

2615
02:03:38.819 --> 02:03:44.692
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2616
02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.629
It is an atomic bomb.

2617
02:03:48.663 --> 02:03:51.799
-(excited chatter)
-(car horns honking)

2618
02:03:51.832 --> 02:03:53.200
It is a harnessing

2619
02:03:53.234 --> 02:03:56.003
of the basic powers
of the universe.

2620
02:03:58.039 --> 02:03:59.674
CHARLOTTE:
<i>Groves on one.</i>

2621
02:03:59.707 --> 02:04:02.743
TRUMAN: We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

2622
02:04:02.777 --> 02:04:05.079
and completely the Japanese...

2623
02:04:05.112 --> 02:04:06.781
ROBERT:
(clears throat) General?

2624
02:04:06.814 --> 02:04:09.850
GROVES: I'm very proud of you
and all of your people.

2625
02:04:09.884 --> 02:04:11.218
It went all right?

2626
02:04:11.252 --> 02:04:14.221
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2627
02:04:14.255 --> 02:04:15.890
ROBERT:
Well,

2628
02:04:15.923 --> 02:04:18.859
everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2629
02:04:20.294 --> 02:04:21.929
It's been a long road.

2630
02:04:21.963 --> 02:04:24.765
GROVES: I think one of
the wisest things I ever did

2631
02:04:24.799 --> 02:04:27.835
was when I selected
the director of Los Alamos.

2632
02:04:27.868 --> 02:04:30.171
-(cheering)
-(car horns honking)

2633
02:04:30.204 --> 02:04:32.540
TRUMAN:
<i>We have spent</i>

2634
02:04:32.573 --> 02:04:34.575
<i>more than $2 billion</i>

2635
02:04:34.608 --> 02:04:38.846
<i>on the greatest</i>
<i>scientific gamble in history,</i>

2636
02:04:38.879 --> 02:04:41.716
<i>and we have won.</i>

2637
02:04:41.749 --> 02:04:44.518
(cheering)

2638
02:04:45.252 --> 02:04:47.955
CROWD (chanting):
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2639
02:04:47.989 --> 02:04:49.991
Oppie! Oppie!

2640
02:04:50.024 --> 02:04:53.227
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2641
02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.096
Oppie! Oppie!

2642
02:04:55.129 --> 02:04:57.898
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2643
02:04:57.932 --> 02:05:01.268
-Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
-(applause)

2644
02:05:01.302 --> 02:05:05.906
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2645
02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:07.274
Oppie! Oppie!

2646
02:05:07.308 --> 02:05:09.877
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2647
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:12.780
(rhythmic stomping)

2648
02:05:13.647 --> 02:05:16.650
(stomping intensifying)

2649
02:05:29.864 --> 02:05:32.700
-(stomping subsides)
-(cheering continues)

2650
02:06:06.634 --> 02:06:08.936
(breathing heavily)

2651
02:06:08.969 --> 02:06:10.071
The world...

2652
02:06:12.073 --> 02:06:13.207
...will remember this day.

2653
02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:15.609
(cheering and applauding)

2654
02:06:24.251 --> 02:06:26.921
(muffled distant rumbling)

2655
02:06:32.126 --> 02:06:33.861
It's too soon to...

2656
02:06:34.728 --> 02:06:36.397
It's too soon to determine

2657
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:38.799
what the results
of the bombing are.

2658
02:06:41.735 --> 02:06:43.337
But I'll bet the Japanese
didn't like it.

2659
02:06:43.370 --> 02:06:45.906
(cheering and applauding)

2660
02:06:52.146 --> 02:06:53.747
-(woman screams)
-(cheering sound muted)

2661
02:06:53.781 --> 02:06:55.316
(distant rumbling continues)

2662
02:06:55.349 --> 02:06:57.985
(Robert breathing heavily)

2663
02:07:04.225 --> 02:07:05.759
I'm so proud.

2664
02:07:06.894 --> 02:07:09.029
So proud of what
you have accomplished.

2665
02:07:10.397 --> 02:07:12.666
(continues breathing heavily)

2666
02:07:15.336 --> 02:07:19.173
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

2667
02:07:24.712 --> 02:07:27.114
(continues breathing heavily)

2668
02:07:27.148 --> 02:07:29.216
(wind howling)

2669
02:07:41.795 --> 02:07:43.030
(jarring musical sting)

2670
02:07:43.063 --> 02:07:45.900
-(cheering sound returns)
-(hearty laughter)

2671
02:07:57.111 --> 02:07:58.979
(somber music playing)

2672
02:08:07.354 --> 02:08:09.723
(sobbing)

2673
02:08:29.511 --> 02:08:32.514
(man weeping)

2674
02:08:32.547 --> 02:08:34.782
(laughter)

2675
02:08:35.449 --> 02:08:37.985
(somber music continues)

2676
02:09:00.908 --> 02:09:03.010
(somber music fading out)

2677
02:09:09.016 --> 02:09:10.884
WOMAN:
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2678
02:09:11.485 --> 02:09:13.787
Dr. Oppenheimer? (chuckles)

2679
02:09:13.821 --> 02:09:15.489
-Nice picture.
-Oh.

2680
02:09:15.523 --> 02:09:17.858
President Truman
will see you now.

2681
02:09:20.562 --> 02:09:22.196
(clears throat)

2682
02:09:31.573 --> 02:09:34.408
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2683
02:09:34.441 --> 02:09:36.377
-Mr. President.
-TRUMAN: Please.

2684
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:38.212
Thank you.

2685
02:09:38.245 --> 02:09:39.780
Secretary Byrnes.

2686
02:09:40.981 --> 02:09:42.983
How's it feel to be

2687
02:09:43.017 --> 02:09:45.052
the most famous man
in the world?

2688
02:09:46.053 --> 02:09:49.123
You helped save a lot
of American lives.

2689
02:09:49.156 --> 02:09:51.526
What we did
at Hiroshima was a...

2690
02:09:51.559 --> 02:09:53.494
And Nagasaki.

2691
02:09:53.528 --> 02:09:55.530
Well, obviously.

2692
02:09:55.563 --> 02:09:59.500
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

2693
02:09:59.534 --> 02:10:02.903
Well, it was hardly
my invention.

2694
02:10:02.936 --> 02:10:05.205
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2695
02:10:05.239 --> 02:10:08.042
(both chuckling)

2696
02:10:08.075 --> 02:10:09.611
Jim tells me you're concerned

2697
02:10:09.644 --> 02:10:11.412
about an arms race
with the Soviets.

2698
02:10:11.445 --> 02:10:13.814
Uh, yes, uh...

2699
02:10:14.516 --> 02:10:16.016
Well, um,

2700
02:10:16.050 --> 02:10:21.155
it's that, uh, now is
our chance to secure

2701
02:10:21.188 --> 02:10:24.058
international cooperation on
(clears throat) atomic energy,

2702
02:10:24.091 --> 02:10:27.127
and... and I'm concerned...

2703
02:10:27.161 --> 02:10:29.396
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2704
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:31.365
I don't think I could give a...

2705
02:10:31.398 --> 02:10:32.801
Never.

2706
02:10:33.434 --> 02:10:35.069
Never.

2707
02:10:35.102 --> 02:10:38.272
Mr. President, the-the Russians
have good physicists

2708
02:10:38.305 --> 02:10:39.940
and-and...
and abundant resources.

2709
02:10:39.973 --> 02:10:42.076
-Abundant? (laughs)
-Yes.

2710
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:45.379
-I don't think so.
-(chuckles)

2711
02:10:45.412 --> 02:10:48.949
Well, they'll-they'll put
everything they have and...

2712
02:10:52.219 --> 02:10:56.090
I hear you're leaving
Los Alamos.

2713
02:10:57.358 --> 02:10:58.459
What should we do with it?

2714
02:10:58.492 --> 02:11:00.994
Give it back to the Indians.

2715
02:11:08.402 --> 02:11:11.639
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer, (sighs)

2716
02:11:11.673 --> 02:11:14.007
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

2717
02:11:14.041 --> 02:11:17.444
we have to build up Los Alamos,

2718
02:11:17.478 --> 02:11:19.380
not shut it down.

2719
02:11:22.617 --> 02:11:24.418
Uh, Mr. President...

2720
02:11:25.486 --> 02:11:26.987
Um...

2721
02:11:29.657 --> 02:11:33.327
I feel that I have blood
on my hands.

2722
02:11:34.428 --> 02:11:37.431
(disquieting music playing)

2723
02:11:53.113 --> 02:11:58.419
You think anyone
in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2724
02:11:58.452 --> 02:12:01.488
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2725
02:12:04.659 --> 02:12:07.027
They care who dropped it.

2726
02:12:07.729 --> 02:12:09.997
I did.

2727
02:12:11.231 --> 02:12:14.201
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2728
02:12:17.204 --> 02:12:18.540
(sniffs)

2729
02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:22.476
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2730
02:12:25.747 --> 02:12:27.214
(Truman clears throat)

2731
02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:36.223
TRUMAN: Don't let that crybaby
back in here.

2732
02:12:41.328 --> 02:12:44.364
STRAUSS: <i>Robert saw that</i>
<i>hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

2733
02:12:44.398 --> 02:12:47.735
<i>By the time I'd met him,</i>
<i>he'd fully embraced</i>

2734
02:12:47.769 --> 02:12:50.337
<i>his "father of the bomb"</i>
<i>reputation.</i>

2735
02:12:50.370 --> 02:12:52.774
Used his profile
to influence policy.

2736
02:12:52.807 --> 02:12:55.342
(clamoring)

2737
02:13:02.249 --> 02:13:03.618
ROBB: <i>Doctor, in the years</i>
<i>following the war,</i>

2738
02:13:03.651 --> 02:13:05.787
would you say that
you exerted a great influence

2739
02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.622
on the atomic policies
of the USA?

2740
02:13:07.655 --> 02:13:10.357
ROBERT: <i>I think great</i>
<i>would be an overstatement.</i>

2741
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:12.359
ROBB: Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

2742
02:13:12.392 --> 02:13:14.094
were you not
personally responsible

2743
02:13:14.127 --> 02:13:16.163
for destroying all opposition
to their export?

2744
02:13:16.196 --> 02:13:19.066
-Could use a-a bottle of beer...
-(laughter)

2745
02:13:19.099 --> 02:13:20.768
...when making atomic weapons.
In fact, you do.

2746
02:13:20.802 --> 02:13:23.270
I was the spokesman,
but the-the opinion

2747
02:13:23.303 --> 02:13:25.105
among scientists was unanimous.

2748
02:13:25.138 --> 02:13:26.808
All along with McCarthy
on the rise,

2749
02:13:26.841 --> 02:13:28.242
he knew he was vulnerable.

2750
02:13:28.275 --> 02:13:29.644
His brother was blacklisted

2751
02:13:29.677 --> 02:13:32.580
by every university
in the country.

2752
02:13:33.681 --> 02:13:36.518
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2753
02:13:39.119 --> 02:13:40.555
And Chevalier went into exile.

2754
02:13:43.691 --> 02:13:45.125
But none of that

2755
02:13:45.158 --> 02:13:47.127
stopped Robert
from pushing the GAC

2756
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.030
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2757
02:13:51.833 --> 02:13:53.300
He was devastated

2758
02:13:53.333 --> 02:13:55.402
when Truman rejected
their recommendation.

2759
02:13:57.137 --> 02:13:59.674
I miss Richard
more than I can bear.

2760
02:13:59.707 --> 02:14:01.475
I know, Ruth, I know.

2761
02:14:01.509 --> 02:14:04.612
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

2762
02:14:07.381 --> 02:14:08.816
ROBERT:
Here comes the birthday boy.

2763
02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:11.451
-To gloat.
-RUTH: Have fun.

2764
02:14:12.452 --> 02:14:14.822
Robert, uh, my son and his
fiancée are desperate to meet

2765
02:14:14.856 --> 02:14:16.824
the father of the atomic bomb,
and so...

2766
02:14:16.858 --> 02:14:19.661
Well. Good day.

2767
02:14:25.733 --> 02:14:27.835
Is this a bad time?

2768
02:14:27.869 --> 02:14:29.369
What do you think, Lewis?

2769
02:14:29.403 --> 02:14:31.471
Well, I think it must have
been a blow for you.

2770
02:14:31.505 --> 02:14:33.641
For the world.

2771
02:14:33.675 --> 02:14:35.309
The world?

2772
02:14:35.342 --> 02:14:39.313
What does Fuchs mean
to the rest of the world?

2773
02:14:39.346 --> 02:14:40.748
Fuchs?

2774
02:14:40.782 --> 02:14:42.382
Klaus Fuchs?

2775
02:14:43.818 --> 02:14:46.219
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2776
02:14:47.889 --> 02:14:49.356
(sighs)

2777
02:14:49.389 --> 02:14:51.258
Klaus Fuchs, the British
scientist that you put

2778
02:14:51.291 --> 02:14:54.328
onto the implosion team
at Los Alamos,

2779
02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:56.496
<i>turns out he was...</i>

2780
02:14:56.531 --> 02:14:59.801
he was spying for the Soviets
the whole time.

2781
02:14:59.834 --> 02:15:01.368
I'm sorry.

2782
02:15:04.371 --> 02:15:06.506
(brooding music playing)

2783
02:15:06.541 --> 02:15:09.443
<i>After the truth</i>
<i>about Fuchs came out,</i>

2784
02:15:09.476 --> 02:15:11.579
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2785
02:15:11.613 --> 02:15:15.482
He knew his phone was tapped,
he was followed everywhere...

2786
02:15:16.851 --> 02:15:18.285
...his trash picked through.

2787
02:15:22.289 --> 02:15:23.758
But never stopped
speaking his mind.

2788
02:15:23.791 --> 02:15:26.460
A man of conviction.

2789
02:15:26.493 --> 02:15:29.329
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2790
02:15:30.832 --> 02:15:34.267
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2791
02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:36.704
He took it.

2792
02:15:36.738 --> 02:15:39.206
America and Russia

2793
02:15:39.239 --> 02:15:43.511
may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle,

2794
02:15:43.544 --> 02:15:46.914
each capable
of killing the other

2795
02:15:46.948 --> 02:15:49.651
but only at the risk
of his own life.

2796
02:15:49.684 --> 02:15:52.452
Now, there are various aspects
of this policy...

2797
02:15:52.486 --> 02:15:54.488
STRAUSS:
<i>Lot of scientists blame me,</i>

2798
02:15:54.522 --> 02:15:57.659
<i>but how was I supposed</i>
<i>to protect him?</i>

2799
02:15:57.692 --> 02:15:59.661
...too secret for discussion,

2800
02:15:59.694 --> 02:16:01.696
candor is the only remedy.

2801
02:16:01.729 --> 02:16:03.263
Officials in Washington

2802
02:16:03.296 --> 02:16:04.799
need to start leveling
with the American people.

2803
02:16:04.832 --> 02:16:06.466
(people murmuring)

2804
02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:09.336
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2805
02:16:09.369 --> 02:16:11.405
So he had to lose
his security clearance.

2806
02:16:11.438 --> 02:16:14.207
-And with it, his credibility.
-(knocking)

2807
02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:16.644
But how could they do it?

2808
02:16:16.678 --> 02:16:17.945
He was a war hero.

2809
02:16:17.979 --> 02:16:19.681
He'd already told everyone
about his past.

2810
02:16:19.714 --> 02:16:21.683
Borden dredged it all up.

2811
02:16:21.716 --> 02:16:24.952
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2812
02:16:24.986 --> 02:16:26.554
Could it have been Nichols?

2813
02:16:26.587 --> 02:16:28.890
No, I can't imagine
he'd do that.

2814
02:16:28.923 --> 02:16:30.958
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2815
02:16:30.992 --> 02:16:32.994
that burned a path
from the White House

2816
02:16:33.027 --> 02:16:35.697
back to my desk at the AEC.

2817
02:16:35.730 --> 02:16:37.565
You see them in there, right?

2818
02:16:37.598 --> 02:16:41.468
I've been working
my whole life to get here.

2819
02:16:41.501 --> 02:16:43.538
Cabinet of
the United States of America.

2820
02:16:43.571 --> 02:16:45.505
Now, in front
of the entire country,

2821
02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:47.608
they're gonna put me
back in my place.

2822
02:16:49.043 --> 02:16:51.713
A lowly shoe salesman.

2823
02:16:51.746 --> 02:16:53.581
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2824
02:16:53.614 --> 02:16:55.683
I-I think we can
get the Senate to grasp

2825
02:16:55.717 --> 02:16:58.519
that you did your duty,
painful though it was.

2826
02:16:58.553 --> 02:17:00.320
Now, will Hill's testimony
back us up?

2827
02:17:00.353 --> 02:17:02.322
-COUNSEL: Hill will be fine.
-I don't really know him,

2828
02:17:02.355 --> 02:17:04.525
but, uh, he was one
of Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2829
02:17:04.559 --> 02:17:06.594
and they never forgave Robert
for not supporting

2830
02:17:06.627 --> 02:17:09.030
their petition
against bombing Japan.

2831
02:17:09.063 --> 02:17:14.267
This was taken 31 days
after the bombing.

2832
02:17:14.301 --> 02:17:17.038
Virtually everyone
in the street,

2833
02:17:17.071 --> 02:17:19.306
for nearly a mile around,

2834
02:17:19.339 --> 02:17:22.543
was instantly
and seriously burned.

2835
02:17:22.577 --> 02:17:23.745
(people gasping)

2836
02:17:23.778 --> 02:17:28.315
The, uh, Japanese spoke of
people who wore striped clothing

2837
02:17:28.348 --> 02:17:31.318
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

2838
02:17:32.385 --> 02:17:34.756
There were many
who thought themselves lucky,

2839
02:17:34.789 --> 02:17:37.491
who climbed out of the ruins
of their homes

2840
02:17:37.525 --> 02:17:39.392
only slightly injured.

2841
02:17:40.528 --> 02:17:42.295
But they died anyway.

2842
02:17:42.964 --> 02:17:46.067
They died days or weeks later

2843
02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:49.436
from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers

2844
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:51.371
at the moment of the explosion.

2845
02:17:52.573 --> 02:17:54.642
Did you read this crap
in the papers?

2846
02:17:54.675 --> 02:17:57.477
A British physicist is saying
the atomic bombings

2847
02:17:57.512 --> 02:17:59.680
were not the last act
of World War II

2848
02:17:59.714 --> 02:18:02.850
but the first act
of this cold war with Russia.

2849
02:18:02.884 --> 02:18:04.351
Which physicist?

2850
02:18:04.384 --> 02:18:05.787
I think you knew him.

2851
02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:07.420
Patrick Blackett.

2852
02:18:08.656 --> 02:18:09.857
(scoffs)

2853
02:18:09.891 --> 02:18:11.458
ROBERT:
He may not be wrong.

2854
02:18:11.491 --> 02:18:12.827
Stimson is now telling me

2855
02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:16.097
we bombed an enemy
that was essentially defeated.

2856
02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:19.667
TELLER: Robert,
you've all the influence now.

2857
02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.401
Please.

2858
02:18:21.434 --> 02:18:23.538
Urge them to continue
my research on the Super.

2859
02:18:23.571 --> 02:18:24.939
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2860
02:18:24.972 --> 02:18:27.074
Why not?

2861
02:18:27.108 --> 02:18:28.810
It's not the right use
of our resources.

2862
02:18:28.843 --> 02:18:30.945
Is that what you really believe?

2863
02:18:30.978 --> 02:18:33.346
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2864
02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:35.783
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2865
02:18:37.084 --> 02:18:38.853
Nobody knows what you believe.

2866
02:18:39.954 --> 02:18:41.823
Do you? Hmm?

2867
02:18:41.856 --> 02:18:44.559
GROVES: <i>One final time,</i>
<i>our program director,</i>

2868
02:18:44.592 --> 02:18:46.561
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2869
02:18:46.594 --> 02:18:47.728
(applause)

2870
02:18:47.762 --> 02:18:49.530
ROBERT:
<i>I hope that in years to come</i>

2871
02:18:49.564 --> 02:18:53.568
you will look back
on your work here with pride.

2872
02:18:53.601 --> 02:18:55.970
But today, that pride
must be tempered

2873
02:18:56.003 --> 02:18:58.338
with a profound concern.

2874
02:18:59.607 --> 02:19:01.408
If atomic weapons
are to be added

2875
02:19:01.441 --> 02:19:03.845
to the arsenals
of a warring world,

2876
02:19:03.878 --> 02:19:07.447
then the day will come
when people will curse

2877
02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.883
the name of Los Alamos.

2878
02:19:12.887 --> 02:19:14.989
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2879
02:19:15.022 --> 02:19:17.024
Stopped off to get this.

2880
02:19:17.058 --> 02:19:19.861
It seems pretty favorable.

2881
02:19:19.894 --> 02:19:20.995
COUNSEL:
There's Oppenheimer.

2882
02:19:21.028 --> 02:19:22.597
What's the caption?

2883
02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:25.465
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought..."

2884
02:19:25.498 --> 02:19:27.001
(soft music plays)

2885
02:19:27.034 --> 02:19:28.603
"...and the US won."

2886
02:19:29.436 --> 02:19:30.705
That'll work.

2887
02:19:30.738 --> 02:19:32.974
Those were your words
from the other day.

2888
02:19:33.007 --> 02:19:34.407
We needed to pivot.

2889
02:19:34.441 --> 02:19:35.710
But how would you know

2890
02:19:35.743 --> 02:19:37.545
what <i>Time</i> magazine's
gonna write?

2891
02:19:37.578 --> 02:19:39.814
Henry Luce is a friend.

2892
02:19:45.953 --> 02:19:49.456
You sat here and let me
tell you how it's done,

2893
02:19:49.489 --> 02:19:52.159
but you've been
far ahead all along.

2894
02:19:52.193 --> 02:19:55.162
Survival in Washington

2895
02:19:55.196 --> 02:19:57.531
is about knowing
how to get things done.

2896
02:19:58.165 --> 02:19:59.567
SENATE AIDE:
Right.

2897
02:20:01.168 --> 02:20:02.904
What was it you said
about Borden?

2898
02:20:02.937 --> 02:20:05.940
"Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?"

2899
02:20:05.973 --> 02:20:07.742
(sighs)

2900
02:20:07.775 --> 02:20:10.778
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2901
02:20:12.847 --> 02:20:15.082
It's gonna come down
to how much influence

2902
02:20:15.116 --> 02:20:17.184
Borden's been able
to exert on Teller.

2903
02:20:17.218 --> 02:20:19.654
-(Kitty laughing)
-Did I say something funny?

2904
02:20:19.687 --> 02:20:21.055
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

2905
02:20:21.088 --> 02:20:24.859
when we all know
that it's Strauss.

2906
02:20:24.892 --> 02:20:26.861
Lewis brought me
to Princeton, Kitty.

2907
02:20:26.894 --> 02:20:29.597
And then you humiliated him
in front of Congress.

2908
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:32.465
But more useful than a sandwich.

2909
02:20:32.499 --> 02:20:34.635
(laughter)

2910
02:20:35.636 --> 02:20:36.804
-How'd I do?
-MAN: I'll call recess,

2911
02:20:36.837 --> 02:20:37.939
ten minutes.

2912
02:20:37.972 --> 02:20:40.207
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2913
02:20:40.241 --> 02:20:41.474
That was six years ago.

2914
02:20:41.509 --> 02:20:43.210
You know, the truly vindictive,

2915
02:20:43.244 --> 02:20:44.845
patient as saints.

2916
02:20:44.879 --> 02:20:47.682
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

2917
02:20:47.715 --> 02:20:51.218
-(glass shatters)
-Wake up. It is Strauss.

2918
02:20:51.252 --> 02:20:54.188
It's always been Strauss,
and you know it.

2919
02:20:54.221 --> 02:20:55.856
Why won't you fight him?

2920
02:20:56.891 --> 02:20:58.092
Christ's sake.

2921
02:20:58.125 --> 02:20:59.160
(door slams)

2922
02:20:59.193 --> 02:21:01.862
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

2923
02:21:01.896 --> 02:21:03.564
or one of Truman's guys.
It was you.

2924
02:21:03.597 --> 02:21:05.566
You gave the file to Borden.

2925
02:21:05.599 --> 02:21:07.234
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2926
02:21:07.268 --> 02:21:09.704
-You convinced him to...
-(loudly): Borden...

2927
02:21:09.737 --> 02:21:11.639
(in normal tone):
didn't take any convincing.

2928
02:21:11.672 --> 02:21:13.774
NICHOLS: Take your time,
use the entire file.

2929
02:21:13.808 --> 02:21:16.711
Write up your conclusion,
send them to the FBI.

2930
02:21:16.744 --> 02:21:18.980
The material
is obviously extensive,

2931
02:21:19.013 --> 02:21:21.682
but there's nothing new here.

2932
02:21:21.716 --> 02:21:23.250
STRAUSS:
Your conclusions will be.

2933
02:21:23.284 --> 02:21:25.586
And they'll have to be answered.

2934
02:21:25.619 --> 02:21:27.088
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2935
02:21:27.121 --> 02:21:30.725
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2936
02:21:30.758 --> 02:21:33.627
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2937
02:21:33.661 --> 02:21:35.262
while you do this with the AEC.

2938
02:21:35.296 --> 02:21:37.131
-A trial.
-No.

2939
02:21:37.164 --> 02:21:40.935
No trial. You can't
give Oppenheimer a platform.

2940
02:21:40.968 --> 02:21:42.737
You can't martyr him.

2941
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:45.940
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2942
02:21:45.973 --> 02:21:49.543
so he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

2943
02:21:49.577 --> 02:21:51.645
Then what?

2944
02:21:52.847 --> 02:21:56.217
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2945
02:21:56.250 --> 02:21:58.019
(speaking indistinctly)

2946
02:22:02.656 --> 02:22:03.924
STRAUSS:
<i>A simple bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2947
02:22:03.958 --> 02:22:06.594
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2948
02:22:06.627 --> 02:22:09.597
You send your accusations
to the FBI.

2949
02:22:11.232 --> 02:22:14.835
Hoover sends them to the AEC,
you're forced to act.

2950
02:22:15.669 --> 02:22:16.971
You write up an indictment

2951
02:22:17.004 --> 02:22:18.639
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

2952
02:22:18.672 --> 02:22:21.342
<i>his security clearance</i>
<i>is not being renewed.</i>

2953
02:22:21.375 --> 02:22:22.910
<i>But offer him</i>
<i>the chance to appeal.</i>

2954
02:22:22.943 --> 02:22:25.279
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2955
02:22:25.312 --> 02:22:26.814
ROBERT:
May I keep this?

2956
02:22:26.847 --> 02:22:27.782
No.

2957
02:22:27.815 --> 02:22:30.051
If you do decide to appeal,

2958
02:22:30.084 --> 02:22:31.619
they'll have to send you a copy.

2959
02:22:31.652 --> 02:22:34.889
When he appeals--
and trust me, he will--

2960
02:22:34.922 --> 02:22:37.324
-I appoint a board.
-(indistinct conversation)

2961
02:22:37.358 --> 02:22:39.827
They will, of course,
have counsel.

2962
02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:41.796
-NICHOLS: Prosecutor?
-In all but name.

2963
02:22:41.829 --> 02:22:43.998
-NICHOLS: Who?
-Roger Robb.

2964
02:22:44.031 --> 02:22:45.199
Ouch.

2965
02:22:45.232 --> 02:22:46.700
Robb will have
security clearance

2966
02:22:46.734 --> 02:22:48.269
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

2967
02:22:48.302 --> 02:22:49.737
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2968
02:22:49.770 --> 02:22:51.138
Defense counsel will not.

2969
02:22:52.973 --> 02:22:54.375
A closed hearing.

2970
02:22:54.408 --> 02:22:55.643
ROBERT: <i>The so-called</i>
<i>derogatory information</i>

2971
02:22:55.676 --> 02:22:57.845
in your indictment of me.

2972
02:22:57.878 --> 02:23:00.347
No audience. No reporters.

2973
02:23:00.381 --> 02:23:03.851
-No burden of proof.
-No burden of proof?

2974
02:23:05.219 --> 02:23:06.720
We're not convicting.

2975
02:23:07.421 --> 02:23:10.024
We're just denying.

2976
02:23:14.995 --> 02:23:17.765
What is it you said?

2977
02:23:17.798 --> 02:23:21.135
"This is just how
the game is played."

2978
02:23:21.168 --> 02:23:24.138
Well, forgive my naivete.

2979
02:23:24.171 --> 02:23:26.140
Amateurs seek the sun.

2980
02:23:27.108 --> 02:23:28.175
Get eaten.

2981
02:23:29.243 --> 02:23:32.079
Power stays in the shadows.

2982
02:23:32.113 --> 02:23:35.816
But, sir, you're...
you're out of the shadows now.

2983
02:23:35.850 --> 02:23:37.284
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2984
02:23:37.318 --> 02:23:38.786
Well...

2985
02:23:40.087 --> 02:23:42.223
Teller's testifying
this morning.

2986
02:23:42.256 --> 02:23:44.658
That'll help. And then...

2987
02:23:44.692 --> 02:23:46.127
Hill is in the afternoon.

2988
02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.629
Hill is gonna help us too.

2989
02:23:50.865 --> 02:23:54.034
STRAUSS: As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2990
02:23:54.068 --> 02:23:55.102
May I keep this?

2991
02:23:55.136 --> 02:23:56.170
NICHOLS:
No.

2992
02:23:58.272 --> 02:24:00.274
If you do decide to appeal,

2993
02:24:00.307 --> 02:24:03.144
then they'll have
to send you a copy.

2994
02:24:03.177 --> 02:24:05.679
(unsettling music playing)

2995
02:24:06.714 --> 02:24:09.016
Take my car and driver.
I insist.

2996
02:24:13.754 --> 02:24:15.689
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

2997
02:24:15.723 --> 02:24:18.425
Of course.
But don't take too long.

2998
02:24:18.459 --> 02:24:20.661
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2999
02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.103
I'm sorry
it's come to this, Robert.

3000
02:24:29.136 --> 02:24:30.171
I think it's wrong.

3001
02:24:30.204 --> 02:24:32.239
(unsettling music building)

3002
02:24:43.484 --> 02:24:44.919
ROBERT:
<i>Nichols wants me to fight</i>

3003
02:24:44.952 --> 02:24:46.954
<i>so he can get it</i>
<i>all on the record.</i>

3004
02:24:46.987 --> 02:24:48.856
Strauss wants me to walk away.

3005
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:51.725
Strauss knows
that you can't do that,

3006
02:24:51.759 --> 02:24:54.195
you'd be accepting the charges.

3007
02:24:54.228 --> 02:24:55.896
You'll lose your job.

3008
02:24:55.930 --> 02:24:58.199
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

3009
02:24:58.232 --> 02:25:00.935
Robert, we have to fight.

3010
02:25:01.769 --> 02:25:03.470
(smacks lips)

3011
02:25:03.504 --> 02:25:05.806
VOLPE: As AEC Counsel,
I can't represent you.

3012
02:25:05.839 --> 02:25:07.374
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

3013
02:25:07.408 --> 02:25:08.943
Oh, he's good.

3014
02:25:08.976 --> 02:25:12.713
The best,
but I have to warn you...

3015
02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:15.816
...this won't be a fair fight.

3016
02:25:15.849 --> 02:25:17.851
-(suspenseful music plays)
-ROBB: <i>During your interview</i>

3017
02:25:17.885 --> 02:25:20.354
with Boris Pash in 1943,
did you refer to microfilm?

3018
02:25:20.387 --> 02:25:21.889
-No.
-Tab 11,

3019
02:25:21.922 --> 02:25:23.357
page one, paragraph three.
You never said,

3020
02:25:23.390 --> 02:25:27.027
"Man at the consulate expert
in the use of microfilm"?

3021
02:25:27.061 --> 02:25:28.395
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-No.

3022
02:25:28.429 --> 02:25:29.363
I would like to know
what document

3023
02:25:29.396 --> 02:25:30.831
Mr. Robb is quoting from

3024
02:25:30.864 --> 02:25:32.132
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

3025
02:25:32.166 --> 02:25:34.235
The document is classified,
Mr. Garrison.

3026
02:25:34.268 --> 02:25:36.103
I think we should get back
to first-hand information.

3027
02:25:36.136 --> 02:25:37.504
This is first-hand.

3028
02:25:37.539 --> 02:25:39.807
How so, Roger?

3029
02:25:41.175 --> 02:25:43.010
There was a recording
of the interview.

3030
02:25:46.981 --> 02:25:48.882
GARRISON:
You let my client sit here

3031
02:25:48.916 --> 02:25:50.417
and potentially perjure himself,

3032
02:25:50.451 --> 02:25:52.987
and all this time,
you had a recording?

3033
02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.388
Nobody told your client

3034
02:25:54.421 --> 02:25:55.823
to misrepresent
his former answers.

3035
02:25:55.856 --> 02:25:57.925
Misrepre...
It-it was 12 years ago.

3036
02:25:57.958 --> 02:25:59.260
Can we hear this recording?

3037
02:25:59.293 --> 02:26:00.861
You don't have the clearance,
Mr. Garrison.

3038
02:26:00.894 --> 02:26:02.530
But you're reading it
into the record.

3039
02:26:02.564 --> 02:26:04.198
Please, please.

3040
02:26:04.231 --> 02:26:07.835
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

3041
02:26:07.868 --> 02:26:10.304
If it's truth,
where's the disclosure?

3042
02:26:10.337 --> 02:26:11.972
Where's the witness list?

3043
02:26:12.006 --> 02:26:14.542
Mr. Garrison, this isn't
a trial, as you are well aware.

3044
02:26:14.576 --> 02:26:16.443
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

3045
02:26:16.477 --> 02:26:18.345
We are dealing
with national security.

3046
02:26:18.379 --> 02:26:19.880
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

3047
02:26:19.913 --> 02:26:22.283
I fail to see how
national security

3048
02:26:22.316 --> 02:26:24.018
prevents the prosecution
from providing us

3049
02:26:24.051 --> 02:26:26.053
-with a list of witnesses.
-Perhaps we are in need

3050
02:26:26.086 --> 02:26:27.388
-of a brief recess.
-ROBERT: Gentlemen,

3051
02:26:27.421 --> 02:26:29.156
you have my words.

3052
02:26:29.189 --> 02:26:31.325
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

3053
02:26:31.358 --> 02:26:34.128
I've already explained
I made up a cock-and-bull story.

3054
02:26:34.161 --> 02:26:37.498
But why would anyone
make up such an elaborate story?

3055
02:26:37.532 --> 02:26:39.601
Because I was an idiot.

3056
02:26:39.634 --> 02:26:41.235
Why lie?

3057
02:26:41.268 --> 02:26:43.871
Well, clearly with
the intention of not revealing

3058
02:26:43.904 --> 02:26:45.973
who the intermediary was.

3059
02:26:46.006 --> 02:26:48.042
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier,
the Communist.

3060
02:26:48.075 --> 02:26:50.344
Is he still your friend?

3061
02:26:50.377 --> 02:26:51.812
Yes.

3062
02:26:53.914 --> 02:26:56.850
GARRISON:
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

3063
02:26:56.884 --> 02:26:58.586
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

3064
02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:00.954
Teller, obviously.

3065
02:27:01.922 --> 02:27:03.190
They've asked Lawrence.

3066
02:27:03.223 --> 02:27:04.058
What did he say?

3067
02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:06.994
He wasn't going
to help them, but...

3068
02:27:07.027 --> 02:27:07.961
But?

3069
02:27:07.995 --> 02:27:09.997
Strauss told him that
you and Ruth Tolman

3070
02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:12.466
<i>have been having</i>
<i>an affair for years.</i>

3071
02:27:12.499 --> 02:27:13.601
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

3072
02:27:13.635 --> 02:27:15.269
-with them in Pasadena.
-(sighs)

3073
02:27:15.302 --> 02:27:16.970
He convinced Lawrence

3074
02:27:17.004 --> 02:27:18.573
that Richard died
of a broken heart.

3075
02:27:18.606 --> 02:27:19.907
That's absurd.

3076
02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:22.476
-What part?
-The broken heart.

3077
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.546
Richard never found out.

3078
02:27:24.579 --> 02:27:26.347
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

3079
02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:27.881
I don't know.

3080
02:27:28.415 --> 02:27:30.050
GARRISON:
Dr. Rabi,

3081
02:27:30.084 --> 02:27:33.153
what governmental positions
do you currently hold?

3082
02:27:33.187 --> 02:27:36.090
I am the chairman of the
General Advisory Committee

3083
02:27:36.123 --> 02:27:39.026
to the AEC,
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

3084
02:27:39.059 --> 02:27:41.895
GARRISON: And how long have
you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

3085
02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:43.531
Since 1928.

3086
02:27:43.565 --> 02:27:45.633
I... I know him quite well.

3087
02:27:45.667 --> 02:27:47.635
Well enough
to speak to the bearing

3088
02:27:47.669 --> 02:27:50.237
of his loyalty and character?

3089
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:54.274
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

3090
02:27:54.308 --> 02:27:56.977
And he is loyal
to the United States,

3091
02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:58.245
to his friends,

3092
02:27:58.278 --> 02:28:00.948
to the institutions
of which he is part.

3093
02:28:02.416 --> 02:28:03.450
Eat.

3094
02:28:06.353 --> 02:28:07.388
(scoffs)

3095
02:28:08.556 --> 02:28:11.158
(suspenseful music continues)

3096
02:28:22.436 --> 02:28:24.138
-ROBERT: What was that?
-(door closes)

3097
02:28:24.171 --> 02:28:26.206
RABI:
Nothing to worry about.

3098
02:28:28.442 --> 02:28:30.177
ROBB:
<i>After the Russian A-bomb test,</i>

3099
02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:32.680
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you
about the hydrogen bomb?

3100
02:28:32.714 --> 02:28:34.516
You'd be better off asking him.

3101
02:28:34.549 --> 02:28:36.083
Well, I fully intend to.

3102
02:28:36.116 --> 02:28:38.686
Would you say
that Dr. Oppenheimer was

3103
02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:40.722
unalterably opposed
to the H-bomb?

3104
02:28:40.755 --> 02:28:43.558
No, he-he thought that
a fusion program

3105
02:28:43.591 --> 02:28:46.694
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission program.

3106
02:28:46.728 --> 02:28:48.563
But that proved
not to be the case.

3107
02:28:48.596 --> 02:28:51.231
In the event both could be done.

3108
02:28:51.265 --> 02:28:53.568
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied

3109
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:54.736
that in his testimony here,

3110
02:28:54.769 --> 02:28:57.037
Dr. Oppenheimer had been
wholly truthful.

3111
02:28:57.070 --> 02:29:00.274
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

3112
02:29:00.307 --> 02:29:02.209
Why go through
all this against a man

3113
02:29:02.242 --> 02:29:04.445
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

3114
02:29:04.478 --> 02:29:06.113
Look at his record.

3115
02:29:06.146 --> 02:29:08.215
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

3116
02:29:08.248 --> 02:29:10.184
We have a whole series
of Super bombs.

3117
02:29:10.217 --> 02:29:12.186
What more do you want?

3118
02:29:12.219 --> 02:29:13.086
Mermaids?

3119
02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.422
TELLER:
But I've known Secretary Strauss

3120
02:29:15.456 --> 02:29:17.057
for many years,

3121
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:20.360
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

3122
02:29:20.394 --> 02:29:23.063
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

3123
02:29:23.096 --> 02:29:24.331
We'll break now,

3124
02:29:24.364 --> 02:29:26.166
unless there's
any immediate business.

3125
02:29:26.200 --> 02:29:28.736
STRAUSS: Senator, I'd like
to once again request

3126
02:29:28.770 --> 02:29:31.438
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

3127
02:29:31.472 --> 02:29:34.241
And I will remind the nominee
that we don't always

3128
02:29:34.274 --> 02:29:36.276
have that information
in advance.

3129
02:29:36.310 --> 02:29:39.747
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

3130
02:29:39.781 --> 02:29:41.415
Mr. Chairman,
our next scheduled witness,

3131
02:29:41.448 --> 02:29:45.986
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently
come down with colitis.

3132
02:29:47.454 --> 02:29:50.357
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

3133
02:29:51.626 --> 02:29:53.026
Mr. Borden, welcome.

3134
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:54.529
Please take a seat.

3135
02:29:55.697 --> 02:29:58.098
Mr. Borden,

3136
02:29:58.131 --> 02:30:00.702
during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

3137
02:30:00.735 --> 02:30:02.369
did you reach
certain conclusions?

3138
02:30:02.402 --> 02:30:04.706
-I did.
-And did there come a time

3139
02:30:04.739 --> 02:30:06.206
when you expressed
those conclusions

3140
02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:08.242
in a letter
to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

3141
02:30:08.275 --> 02:30:10.210
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

3142
02:30:10.244 --> 02:30:11.646
-BORDEN: That is correct.
-Prior to the writing

3143
02:30:11.679 --> 02:30:13.447
of the letter, did you discuss
the writing of the letter

3144
02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:15.783
with anybody attached to
the Atomic Energy Commission?

3145
02:30:15.817 --> 02:30:17.417
I did not.

3146
02:30:17.451 --> 02:30:18.786
ROBB: Thanks, and do you have
a copy of the letter?

3147
02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:20.420
BORDEN:
I have one in front of me.

3148
02:30:20.454 --> 02:30:22.557
Would you please be so kind
as to read it, sir?

3149
02:30:22.590 --> 02:30:24.124
BORDEN:
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

3150
02:30:24.157 --> 02:30:25.593
the purpose of this letter
is to state..."

3151
02:30:25.627 --> 02:30:27.662
GARRISON: Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, if I could have a...

3152
02:30:27.695 --> 02:30:30.063
What is the purpose
of the delay?

3153
02:30:30.097 --> 02:30:31.566
He's simply gonna
read the letter.

3154
02:30:31.599 --> 02:30:33.133
(scoffs) Mr. Chairman,

3155
02:30:33.166 --> 02:30:35.168
this is the first
I've seen of this letter,

3156
02:30:35.202 --> 02:30:36.470
and I see statements here, uh,

3157
02:30:36.503 --> 02:30:38.472
at least one,
of a kind that I don't think

3158
02:30:38.505 --> 02:30:40.474
anyone would like to see
go into the record.

3159
02:30:40.507 --> 02:30:43.277
These are accusations that have
not previously been made.

3160
02:30:43.310 --> 02:30:45.245
That are not part of
the indictment from Nichols.

3161
02:30:45.279 --> 02:30:47.414
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

3162
02:30:47.447 --> 02:30:49.617
The witness wrote this letter
on his own initiative,

3163
02:30:49.651 --> 02:30:52.219
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

3164
02:30:52.252 --> 02:30:53.855
His conclusions
are valid testimony,

3165
02:30:53.888 --> 02:30:55.790
just like the...
the positive conclusions

3166
02:30:55.823 --> 02:30:57.157
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

3167
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:58.693
It cuts both ways.

3168
02:30:58.726 --> 02:31:01.161
How long has Counsel been
in possession of this letter?

3169
02:31:01.194 --> 02:31:02.564
I don't think
I should be subject

3170
02:31:02.597 --> 02:31:05.165
to cross-examination by you,
Mr. Garrison.

3171
02:31:05.198 --> 02:31:06.834
GRAY: Mr. Garrison,
given that we on the board

3172
02:31:06.868 --> 02:31:08.368
have all read the letter,

3173
02:31:08.402 --> 02:31:10.738
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

3174
02:31:10.772 --> 02:31:12.239
Let's proceed.

3175
02:31:12.272 --> 02:31:14.207
(tense music playing)

3176
02:31:14.241 --> 02:31:15.710
BORDEN:
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

3177
02:31:15.743 --> 02:31:19.179

3192
02:31:58.251 --> 02:31:59.486
I'm sorry, Robert.

3193
02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:00.855
BORDEN:
"...atomic energy, intelligence

3194
02:32:00.888 --> 02:32:02.255
-and diplomatic policy."
-Is anyone

3195
02:32:02.289 --> 02:32:03.925
ever going to tell the truth

3196
02:32:03.958 --> 02:32:05.727
about what's happening here?

3197
02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:09.296
CHAIRMAN MAGNUSON: <i>We will now</i>
<i>hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

3198
02:32:09.329 --> 02:32:11.733
(soft suspenseful music plays)

3199
02:32:18.539 --> 02:32:19.874
Dr. Hill,

3200
02:32:19.907 --> 02:32:22.543
would you care
to make a statement?

3201
02:32:23.678 --> 02:32:25.245
Thank you.

3202
02:32:25.278 --> 02:32:28.950
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

3203
02:32:28.983 --> 02:32:31.385
A man who has
given years of service

3204
02:32:31.418 --> 02:32:34.388
in high positions of government

3205
02:32:34.421 --> 02:32:39.359
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

3206
02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:41.863
The views I have to express
are my own,

3207
02:32:41.896 --> 02:32:45.600
but I believe that much I have
to say will help to indicate

3208
02:32:45.633 --> 02:32:49.336
why most of the scientists
in this country

3209
02:32:49.369 --> 02:32:52.372
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

3210
02:32:52.406 --> 02:32:54.241
completely out of government.

3211
02:32:54.274 --> 02:32:56.243
(murmurs of surprise)

3212
02:32:56.276 --> 02:32:58.780
You're... You're referring
to the hostility

3213
02:32:58.813 --> 02:33:00.280
of certain scientists

3214
02:33:00.313 --> 02:33:01.949
directed toward Mr. Strauss

3215
02:33:01.983 --> 02:33:04.217
because of his commitment
to security

3216
02:33:04.251 --> 02:33:07.254
as demonstrated
in the Oppenheimer affair?

3217
02:33:09.724 --> 02:33:10.992
No.

3218
02:33:11.025 --> 02:33:13.427
Because of the personal
vindictiveness

3219
02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:15.697
he demonstrated against
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3220
02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:17.330
(people exclaiming)

3221
02:33:17.364 --> 02:33:19.499
-MAGNUSON: Order.
-(gavel banging)

3222
02:33:19.534 --> 02:33:20.568
Order!

3223
02:33:20.601 --> 02:33:25.873
It appears to most
scientists around this country

3224
02:33:25.907 --> 02:33:27.441
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being

3225
02:33:27.474 --> 02:33:29.711
pilloried and put through
an ordeal

3226
02:33:29.744 --> 02:33:32.847
because he expressed
his honest opinions.

3227
02:33:33.848 --> 02:33:35.917
Dr. Bush, I thought
I was performing a service

3228
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:37.685
to my country
when hearing this case.

3229
02:33:37.719 --> 02:33:41.856
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

3230
02:33:41.889 --> 02:33:44.525
because he expressed
strong opinions.

3231
02:33:44.559 --> 02:33:47.628
If you want to try that case,
you should try me.

3232
02:33:47.662 --> 02:33:51.666
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred,

3233
02:33:51.699 --> 02:33:52.900
but I am.

3234
02:33:52.934 --> 02:33:54.902
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

3235
02:33:54.936 --> 02:33:57.370
that Mr. Strauss
did not bring the charges

3236
02:33:57.404 --> 02:34:00.474
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

3237
02:34:00.507 --> 02:34:03.010
The Oppenheimer matter was

3238
02:34:03.044 --> 02:34:05.412
initiated and carried through

3239
02:34:05.445 --> 02:34:07.815
largely through the animus
of Lewis Strauss.

3240
02:34:07.849 --> 02:34:09.382
(people exclaim)

3241
02:34:09.416 --> 02:34:12.053
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

3242
02:34:12.086 --> 02:34:13.688
on the shipment
of isotopes to Norway,

3243
02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:17.725
and Strauss never forgave him
this public humiliation.

3244
02:34:17.759 --> 02:34:20.360
Another controversy between them
centered around

3245
02:34:20.393 --> 02:34:23.363
their differences in judgment
on how the H-bomb

3246
02:34:23.396 --> 02:34:25.465
<i>would contribute</i>
<i>to national security.</i>

3247
02:34:25.499 --> 02:34:27.467
Strauss turned to
the personnel security system

3248
02:34:27.501 --> 02:34:31.739
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

3249
02:34:31.773 --> 02:34:34.307
and Strauss was able to find
a few ambitious men

3250
02:34:34.341 --> 02:34:37.377
who also disagreed
with Oppenheimer's positions

3251
02:34:37.410 --> 02:34:40.447
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

3252
02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.084
TELLER: I've always assumed,
and still assume,

3253
02:34:43.117 --> 02:34:45.352
that he's loyal
to the United States.

3254
02:34:45.385 --> 02:34:46.788
I believe this.
And I shall believe it

3255
02:34:46.821 --> 02:34:49.389
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

3256
02:34:49.422 --> 02:34:51.391
Do you or do you not believe

3257
02:34:51.424 --> 02:34:53.728
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?

3258
02:34:54.729 --> 02:34:55.830
(smacks lips)

3259
02:34:57.464 --> 02:34:58.733
In a great number of cases,

3260
02:34:58.766 --> 02:35:00.735
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way

3261
02:35:00.768 --> 02:35:04.639
which was to me
exceedingly hard to understand.

3262
02:35:04.672 --> 02:35:06.674
I thoroughly disagreed
with him in numerous issues,

3263
02:35:06.707 --> 02:35:08.810
and his actions frankly
appeared to me

3264
02:35:08.843 --> 02:35:10.377
confused and complicated.

3265
02:35:10.410 --> 02:35:11.946
To this extent, I feel,

3266
02:35:11.979 --> 02:35:15.082
I want to see the vital
interest of this country

3267
02:35:15.116 --> 02:35:16.951
in hands which
I understand better

3268
02:35:16.984 --> 02:35:19.120
and therefore trust more.

3269
02:35:19.153 --> 02:35:21.923
-MORGAN: Thank you, Doctor.
-ROBB: Thank you.

3270
02:35:25.726 --> 02:35:26.828
I'm sorry.

3271
02:35:29.462 --> 02:35:31.632
KITTY:
<i>You shook his fucking hand?</i>

3272
02:35:31.666 --> 02:35:34.569
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

3273
02:35:34.602 --> 02:35:36.137
Not sure the board
would have appreciated that.

3274
02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:37.738
KITTY: Is it not
gentlemanly enough for you?

3275
02:35:37.772 --> 02:35:41.108
Well, I-I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

3276
02:35:41.142 --> 02:35:43.110
Gray must see
what Robb is doing.

3277
02:35:43.144 --> 02:35:45.079
Why doesn't he just
shut him down?

3278
02:35:45.112 --> 02:35:47.715
And you shaking Teller's hand.

3279
02:35:47.748 --> 02:35:50.618
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

3280
02:35:51.619 --> 02:35:54.021
Under the current
AEC guidelines,

3281
02:35:54.055 --> 02:35:56.456
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

3282
02:35:56.489 --> 02:35:58.793
(unnerving music playing)

3283
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:04.999
Under my interpretation (sighs)

3284
02:36:05.032 --> 02:36:07.168
of the Atomic Energy Act,

3285
02:36:07.201 --> 02:36:09.036
which did not exist

3286
02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:11.906
when I hired
Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

3287
02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:16.544
I would not clear him today,

3288
02:36:16.577 --> 02:36:18.546
uh, if I were on the commission.

3289
02:36:18.579 --> 02:36:20.147
ROBB: Good. Thank you, General.
That is all.

3290
02:36:20.181 --> 02:36:22.183
But I don't think I'd clear
any of those guys.

3291
02:36:22.216 --> 02:36:24.384
That's all.

3292
02:36:26.888 --> 02:36:29.023
GARRISON: Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

3293
02:36:29.056 --> 02:36:30.558
in the selection
or the clearance

3294
02:36:30.591 --> 02:36:31.893
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

3295
02:36:31.926 --> 02:36:33.194
No. None at all.

3296
02:36:33.227 --> 02:36:34.829
And you wouldn't want
to leave this board

3297
02:36:34.862 --> 02:36:37.632
with any suggestion today
that you're here questioning

3298
02:36:37.665 --> 02:36:39.700
his basic loyalty
to the United States

3299
02:36:39.734 --> 02:36:41.135
in the operation of Los Alamos?

3300
02:36:41.168 --> 02:36:42.737
By no means.

3301
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:44.772
I hope I didn't lead anyone
to believe otherwise

3302
02:36:44.805 --> 02:36:46.439
for an instant.

3303
02:36:46.473 --> 02:36:47.575
GRAY:
Thank you, General.

3304
02:36:47.608 --> 02:36:50.645
(wistful music playing)

3305
02:37:05.626 --> 02:37:07.895
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

3306
02:37:07.929 --> 02:37:09.196
She'll be here.

3307
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:10.665
Do you even want her here?

3308
02:37:10.698 --> 02:37:13.200
Only a fool or an adolescent

3309
02:37:13.234 --> 02:37:15.136
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

3310
02:37:15.169 --> 02:37:17.470
and you're neither, Lloyd.

3311
02:37:17.504 --> 02:37:19.006
(door shuts)

3312
02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.008
Kitty and I,

3313
02:37:21.042 --> 02:37:23.110
we're grown-ups.

3314
02:37:23.144 --> 02:37:25.980
<i>We've walked</i>
<i>through fire together.</i>

3315
02:37:26.013 --> 02:37:28.582
She'll do fine.

3316
02:37:28.616 --> 02:37:30.685
GARRISON: Would you describe
your views on Communism

3317
02:37:30.718 --> 02:37:32.753
as pro, anti, neutral?

3318
02:37:32.787 --> 02:37:34.655
KITTY:
Very strongly against.

3319
02:37:34.689 --> 02:37:36.824
I-I've had nothing to do
with Communism in... since...

3320
02:37:36.857 --> 02:37:39.694
since 1936, since...

3321
02:37:39.727 --> 02:37:42.596
since before I met Robert.

3322
02:37:43.197 --> 02:37:45.032
That's all.

3323
02:37:45.066 --> 02:37:46.634
HILL:
<i>The record demonstrates</i>

3324
02:37:46.667 --> 02:37:48.269
<i>that Oppenheimer</i>
<i>was not interrogated</i>

3325
02:37:48.302 --> 02:37:51.539
<i>by impartial and disinterested</i>
<i>counsel for the Gray board.</i>

3326
02:37:51.572 --> 02:37:52.974
<i>He was interrogated</i>
<i>by a prosecutor</i>

3327
02:37:53.007 --> 02:37:54.675
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

3328
02:37:54.709 --> 02:37:56.510
<i>of a rather ingenious</i>
<i>legal background.</i>

3329
02:37:56.544 --> 02:37:57.979
SENATOR SCOTT:
You are charging now

3330
02:37:58.012 --> 02:38:00.982
that the Gray board
permitted a prosecution.

3331
02:38:01.015 --> 02:38:03.718
If I were on the Gray board,

3332
02:38:03.751 --> 02:38:05.720
I would have protested
against the tactics

3333
02:38:05.753 --> 02:38:08.656
of the man who served, in fact,
as the prosecuting counsel.

3334
02:38:08.689 --> 02:38:11.892
A man appointed not by the board

3335
02:38:11.926 --> 02:38:13.995
but by Lewis Strauss.

3336
02:38:14.028 --> 02:38:15.963
(people exclaim)

3337
02:38:15.997 --> 02:38:17.031
Who was this?

3338
02:38:18.332 --> 02:38:20.167
I'm sorry?

3339
02:38:20.201 --> 02:38:21.268
Who was this?

3340
02:38:21.302 --> 02:38:22.737
Uh, Roger Robb.

3341
02:38:22.770 --> 02:38:25.106
-(chair scrapes)
-Mrs. Oppenheimer.

3342
02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:29.276
(pensive music playing)

3343
02:38:29.310 --> 02:38:31.746
Did you have a Communist Party
membership card?

3344
02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:35.282
I'm... I'm not sure.

3345
02:38:35.316 --> 02:38:36.817
ROBB:
Not sure?

3346
02:38:39.787 --> 02:38:40.788
Well...

3347
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:44.925
-(sighs)
-ROBB: Well?

3348
02:38:53.868 --> 02:38:56.837
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

3349
02:38:56.871 --> 02:39:00.641
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

3350
02:39:03.811 --> 02:39:04.945
Yeah.

3351
02:39:08.015 --> 02:39:09.717
(sighs)

3352
02:39:10.317 --> 02:39:11.719
(softly):
Sorry.

3353
02:39:12.353 --> 02:39:13.954
ROBB:
Yes. Mm.

3354
02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:17.792
It's just it was all
so very long ago,

3355
02:39:17.825 --> 02:39:19.660
-Mr. Robb, wasn't it?
-Not really.

3356
02:39:19.693 --> 02:39:20.928
Long enough to have forgotten.

3357
02:39:20.961 --> 02:39:22.329
Did you return the card
or rip it up?

3358
02:39:22.363 --> 02:39:23.964
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

3359
02:39:23.998 --> 02:39:25.800
Your Communist Party
membership card.

3360
02:39:25.833 --> 02:39:27.568
Haven't the slightest idea.

3361
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:32.640
Can a distinction
be made between

3362
02:39:32.673 --> 02:39:34.341
Soviet Communism and Communism?

3363
02:39:34.375 --> 02:39:35.943
Well, in the days
when I was a member,

3364
02:39:35.976 --> 02:39:37.611
I thought they were
definitely two things.

3365
02:39:37.645 --> 02:39:38.913
-Oh?
-I thought that

3366
02:39:38.946 --> 02:39:40.815
the Communist Party
of the United States

3367
02:39:40.848 --> 02:39:43.250
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

3368
02:39:43.284 --> 02:39:44.752
I now no longer believe this.

3369
02:39:44.785 --> 02:39:45.820
Believe the whole thing's
linked together

3370
02:39:45.853 --> 02:39:47.121
and spread all over the world,

3371
02:39:47.154 --> 02:39:49.356
and I have believed this
since I left the Party

3372
02:39:49.390 --> 02:39:50.858
16 years ago.

3373
02:39:50.891 --> 02:39:52.193
-But...
-Seventeen years ago.

3374
02:39:52.226 --> 02:39:53.627
My mistake.

3375
02:39:53.661 --> 02:39:56.297
-But you said...
-Sorry, 18.

3376
02:39:56.330 --> 02:39:58.599
Eighteen years ago.

3377
02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:00.701
ROBB:
Are you familiar with the fact

3378
02:40:00.734 --> 02:40:01.902
your husband was
making contributions

3379
02:40:01.936 --> 02:40:05.005
to the Spanish Civil War
as late as 1942?

3380
02:40:05.039 --> 02:40:06.907
I knew that Robert gave money
from time to time.

3381
02:40:06.941 --> 02:40:08.175
Did you know
this money was going

3382
02:40:08.209 --> 02:40:09.643
into Communist Party channels?

3383
02:40:09.677 --> 02:40:11.112
Don't you mean "through"?

3384
02:40:11.145 --> 02:40:12.913
-Pardon?
-I think you mean

3385
02:40:12.947 --> 02:40:14.748
"through Communist Party
channels," don't you?

3386
02:40:14.782 --> 02:40:16.016
-Y-Yes!
-Yes?

3387
02:40:16.050 --> 02:40:17.952
-Yes!
-KITTY: Yes.

3388
02:40:17.985 --> 02:40:21.689
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

3389
02:40:21.722 --> 02:40:23.023
your husband had not stopped

3390
02:40:23.057 --> 02:40:24.992
having anything to do
with the Communist Party?

3391
02:40:25.025 --> 02:40:26.827
You don't have
to answer that yes or no.

3392
02:40:26.861 --> 02:40:28.229
You can answer that
any way you wish.

3393
02:40:28.262 --> 02:40:30.131
I know that, thank you.

3394
02:40:30.164 --> 02:40:31.866
It's your question.

3395
02:40:31.899 --> 02:40:33.801
-It's not properly phrased.
-Do you understand

3396
02:40:33.834 --> 02:40:35.069
-what I'm getting at?
-I do.

3397
02:40:35.102 --> 02:40:36.370
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

3398
02:40:36.403 --> 02:40:38.005
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

3399
02:40:38.038 --> 02:40:39.974
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

3400
02:40:40.007 --> 02:40:41.809
Because Robert never
had anything to do

3401
02:40:41.842 --> 02:40:43.144
with the Communist Party
as such.

3402
02:40:43.177 --> 02:40:45.813
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

3403
02:40:45.846 --> 02:40:47.781
I know he took
an intellectual interest

3404
02:40:47.815 --> 02:40:49.016
in Communist ideas...

3405
02:40:49.049 --> 02:40:50.151
Are there two types
of Communists?

3406
02:40:50.184 --> 02:40:51.886
Intellectual Communists

3407
02:40:51.919 --> 02:40:53.854
and your plain old
regular Commie?

3408
02:40:53.888 --> 02:40:54.822
(laughs)

3409
02:40:54.855 --> 02:40:56.423
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

3410
02:40:56.457 --> 02:40:59.226
EVANS:
(laughs) I couldn't either.

3411
02:41:05.366 --> 02:41:07.168
GARRISON:
Evening.

3412
02:41:07.201 --> 02:41:08.936
VOLPE: Robert,
you can't win this thing.

3413
02:41:08.969 --> 02:41:10.905
It's a kangaroo court
with a predetermined outcome.

3414
02:41:10.938 --> 02:41:12.873
Why put yourself
through more of it?

3415
02:41:13.474 --> 02:41:15.910
I have my reasons.

3416
02:41:16.511 --> 02:41:17.945
All right.

3417
02:41:17.978 --> 02:41:19.113
Good night.

3418
02:41:23.817 --> 02:41:25.219
He has a point.

3419
02:41:26.153 --> 02:41:28.189
I'm not sure
you understand, Albert.

3420
02:41:28.222 --> 02:41:29.323
EINSTEIN:
No?

3421
02:41:29.356 --> 02:41:32.860
I left my country
never to return.

3422
02:41:33.494 --> 02:41:35.462
You served your country well.

3423
02:41:35.496 --> 02:41:39.133
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

3424
02:41:39.166 --> 02:41:42.803
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

3425
02:41:42.836 --> 02:41:45.472
Damn it, I happen
to love this country.

3426
02:41:45.506 --> 02:41:48.108
Then tell them to go to hell.

3427
02:41:48.142 --> 02:41:49.043
Interestingly enough,

3428
02:41:49.076 --> 02:41:52.146
this is no longer
a confirmation hearing,

3429
02:41:52.179 --> 02:41:54.348
it's now a trial...

3430
02:41:54.381 --> 02:41:56.116
about a trial!

3431
02:41:57.117 --> 02:41:58.419
It's not good
he's telling everyone

3432
02:41:58.452 --> 02:41:59.753
you initiated the hearings.

3433
02:41:59.787 --> 02:42:02.156
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

3434
02:42:02.189 --> 02:42:04.858
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

3435
02:42:04.892 --> 02:42:07.228
We're not in court, sir.

3436
02:42:07.261 --> 02:42:08.462
There's no burden of proof.

3437
02:42:08.495 --> 02:42:10.864
Right. They're not convicting...

3438
02:42:10.898 --> 02:42:12.166
(sighs) just denying.

3439
02:42:12.199 --> 02:42:15.102
Why would Hill come here
to tear me down?

3440
02:42:15.135 --> 02:42:16.770
What's his angle?

3441
02:42:16.804 --> 02:42:18.906
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

3442
02:42:18.939 --> 02:42:20.542
-As he sees it.
-I told you,

3443
02:42:20.575 --> 02:42:23.244
Oppenheimer poisoned
the scientists against me,

3444
02:42:23.277 --> 02:42:24.979
right from that first meeting.

3445
02:42:25.012 --> 02:42:28.249
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer</i>
<i>said to him that day,</i>

3446
02:42:28.282 --> 02:42:31.018
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

3447
02:42:31.051 --> 02:42:32.086
(inaudible)

3448
02:42:32.119 --> 02:42:35.222
<i>Oppenheimer knows</i>
<i>how to manipulate his own.</i>

3449
02:42:35.256 --> 02:42:36.524
And at Los Alamos,

3450
02:42:36.558 --> 02:42:38.892
he preyed
on the naivete of scientists

3451
02:42:38.926 --> 02:42:41.228
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work,

3452
02:42:41.262 --> 02:42:44.265
but don't ever think
he was that naive himself.

3453
02:42:44.298 --> 02:42:45.567
ROBB:
Doctor.

3454
02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:47.569
During your work
on the hydrogen bomb,

3455
02:42:47.602 --> 02:42:51.272
were you deterred
by any moral qualms?

3456
02:42:51.305 --> 02:42:52.940
Yes, of course.

3457
02:42:52.973 --> 02:42:54.275
ROBB: But you still got on
with your work, didn't you?

3458
02:42:54.308 --> 02:42:56.544
Yes, because this was
work of exploration,

3459
02:42:56.578 --> 02:42:58.812
it was not the preparation
of a weapon.

3460
02:42:58.846 --> 02:43:00.914
You mean it was more of a...
an academic excursion.

3461
02:43:00.948 --> 02:43:02.850
No, it is not an academic thing

3462
02:43:02.883 --> 02:43:04.285
whether you can build
a hydrogen bomb.

3463
02:43:04.318 --> 02:43:05.919
It's a matter of life and death.

3464
02:43:05.953 --> 02:43:07.321
By 1942, you were
actively pushing

3465
02:43:07.354 --> 02:43:08.922
the development of
the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

3466
02:43:08.956 --> 02:43:10.190
Pushing's not the right word.

3467
02:43:10.224 --> 02:43:12.159
Supporting it
and working on it, yes.

3468
02:43:12.192 --> 02:43:14.529
So when did these moral qualms
become so strong

3469
02:43:14.562 --> 02:43:16.196
that you actively opposed

3470
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:17.898
the development
of the hydrogen bomb?

3471
02:43:17.931 --> 02:43:19.900
When it was suggested
that it be the policy

3472
02:43:19.933 --> 02:43:22.102
of the United States to make
these things at all cost

3473
02:43:22.136 --> 02:43:24.138
without regard to the balance
between these weapons

3474
02:43:24.171 --> 02:43:27.241
and atomic weapons
as part of our arsenal.

3475
02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:30.545
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

3476
02:43:30.578 --> 02:43:32.614
Wha... What do moral qualms

3477
02:43:32.647 --> 02:43:34.181
-have to do with it?
-ROBB: Yes.

3478
02:43:34.214 --> 02:43:36.283
Oppenheimer wanted
to own the atomic bomb.

3479
02:43:36.317 --> 02:43:38.218
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

3480
02:43:38.252 --> 02:43:41.422
He talks about
putting the nuclear genie

3481
02:43:41.455 --> 02:43:42.923
back in the bottle.

3482
02:43:42.956 --> 02:43:44.091
Well, I'm here to tell you

3483
02:43:44.124 --> 02:43:46.327
that I know
J. Robert Oppenheimer,

3484
02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:50.464
and if he could do it all over,
he'd do it all the same.

3485
02:43:50.497 --> 02:43:53.535
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

3486
02:43:53.568 --> 02:43:56.437
He'd do it all over. Why?

3487
02:43:56.470 --> 02:43:57.905
Because it made him

3488
02:43:57.938 --> 02:43:59.574
the most important man
who ever lived.

3489
02:43:59.607 --> 02:44:01.942
(voice quivering):
Well, we've...

3490
02:44:01.975 --> 02:44:04.078
we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

3491
02:44:04.111 --> 02:44:06.213
ROBB: In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting

3492
02:44:06.246 --> 02:44:07.649
the target to drop
the atomic bomb on Japan,

3493
02:44:07.682 --> 02:44:09.350
-didn't you?
-Yes.

3494
02:44:09.383 --> 02:44:11.018
ROBB: Well, then you knew,
did you not, that by dropping

3495
02:44:11.051 --> 02:44:13.220
that atomic bomb
on the target you selected,

3496
02:44:13.253 --> 02:44:14.656
that thousands of civilians
would be killed

3497
02:44:14.689 --> 02:44:16.423
or injured, is that correct?

3498
02:44:16.457 --> 02:44:18.359
Yes, not as many
as turned out...

3499
02:44:18.392 --> 02:44:20.595
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

3500
02:44:20.628 --> 02:44:22.496
-70,000.
-ROBB: 70,000

3501
02:44:22.530 --> 02:44:23.598
at both Hiroshima and...

3502
02:44:23.631 --> 02:44:25.065
110,000 at both.

3503
02:44:25.099 --> 02:44:26.500
ROBB:
On the day of each bombing?

3504
02:44:26.534 --> 02:44:28.435
(tense music playing)

3505
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:29.637
Yes.

3506
02:44:29.671 --> 02:44:31.238
And in the weeks
and years that followed?

3507
02:44:31.271 --> 02:44:33.974
It has been put at somewhere
between 50 and 100,000.

3508
02:44:34.007 --> 02:44:36.110
-220,000 dead at least?
-ROBERT: Yes.

3509
02:44:36.143 --> 02:44:38.045
Any moral scruples about that?

3510
02:44:39.413 --> 02:44:40.515
Terrible ones.

3511
02:44:40.548 --> 02:44:42.116
But yet you testified in here

3512
02:44:42.149 --> 02:44:44.519
that the bombing of Hiroshima
was very successful.

3513
02:44:44.552 --> 02:44:46.120
-Technically successful.
-ROBB: Oh!

3514
02:44:46.153 --> 02:44:47.921
Technically, it was
very successful.

3515
02:44:47.955 --> 02:44:49.423
And it is also alleged
to have helped end the war.

3516
02:44:49.456 --> 02:44:51.425
Would you have been
in support of the dropping

3517
02:44:51.458 --> 02:44:53.394
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

3518
02:44:53.427 --> 02:44:54.962
That would make no sense at all.

3519
02:44:54.995 --> 02:44:57.431
-Why?
-The-the target is too small.

3520
02:44:57.464 --> 02:44:59.967
Well, supposing there had been
a target in Japan

3521
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.468
big enough for
a thermonuclear weapon,

3522
02:45:01.502 --> 02:45:03.270
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

3523
02:45:03.303 --> 02:45:05.139
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted...

3524
02:45:05.172 --> 02:45:06.608
Well, I'm confronting you
with it now, sir.

3525
02:45:06.641 --> 02:45:08.409
It was all part of his plan.

3526
02:45:08.442 --> 02:45:10.010
He wanted the glorious,

3527
02:45:10.043 --> 02:45:12.212
insincere guilt
of the self-important

3528
02:45:12.246 --> 02:45:13.715
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

3529
02:45:13.748 --> 02:45:17.184
Say, "No, we cannot
go down this road,"

3530
02:45:17.217 --> 02:45:20.020
even as he knew we'd have to.

3531
02:45:20.053 --> 02:45:21.589
Would you have been opposed
to the dropping

3532
02:45:21.623 --> 02:45:23.290
of a thermonuclear weapon
on Japan

3533
02:45:23.323 --> 02:45:25.560
-because of moral scruples?
-Yes, I believe I would, sir.

3534
02:45:25.593 --> 02:45:27.294
Well, did you oppose
the dropping

3535
02:45:27.327 --> 02:45:29.329
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

3536
02:45:29.363 --> 02:45:30.998
-We set forth our arguments...
-(tense music building)

3537
02:45:31.031 --> 02:45:32.433
No, you, you, you.
I'm asking you.

3538
02:45:32.466 --> 02:45:34.101
-I set... I set forth...
-ROBB: Not we. You, you, you!

3539
02:45:34.134 --> 02:45:35.737
...our arguments
against dropping it,

3540
02:45:35.770 --> 02:45:37.304
but I did not endorse them.

3541
02:45:37.337 --> 02:45:39.039
You mean after
working night and day

3542
02:45:39.072 --> 02:45:40.441
for three years
building the bomb,

3543
02:45:40.474 --> 02:45:42.309
you then argued against
the use of it? (laughs)

3544
02:45:42.342 --> 02:45:45.045
I was asked
by the Secretary of War

3545
02:45:45.078 --> 02:45:46.447
what the views
of scientists were.

3546
02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:49.216
I gave him the views against
and the views for.

3547
02:45:49.249 --> 02:45:51.251
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

3548
02:45:51.285 --> 02:45:52.754
-What do you mean "support"?
-ROBB: Didn't you?

3549
02:45:52.787 --> 02:45:54.254
-You supported it!
-What do you mean "support"?

3550
02:45:54.288 --> 02:45:55.623
Well, you helped
pick the target, didn't you?

3551
02:45:55.657 --> 02:45:57.291
-(muffled rumbling)
-I did my job.

3552
02:45:57.324 --> 02:45:59.059
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

3553
02:45:59.092 --> 02:46:00.728
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

3554
02:46:00.762 --> 02:46:03.030
Well, then you would have
built the H-bomb too,

3555
02:46:03.063 --> 02:46:04.198
-wouldn't you?
-I couldn't.

3556
02:46:04.231 --> 02:46:06.133
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

3557
02:46:06.166 --> 02:46:08.502
And the GAC report
which you co-authored

3558
02:46:08.536 --> 02:46:10.404
after the Soviet
atomic test said

3559
02:46:10.437 --> 02:46:13.106
a Super bomb
should never be built!

3560
02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:14.475
What we meant,
what I meant was...

3561
02:46:14.508 --> 02:46:16.578
-ROBB: What you, who? Who?
-What I meant...

3562
02:46:16.611 --> 02:46:18.312
(tense music continues)

3563
02:46:18.345 --> 02:46:19.781
And wouldn't the Russians
do anything

3564
02:46:19.814 --> 02:46:22.082
-to increase their strength?
-(music stops)

3565
02:46:22.115 --> 02:46:24.084
(raises voice): If we did it,
they would have to do it.

3566
02:46:24.117 --> 02:46:26.153
Our efforts would only
fuel their efforts,

3567
02:46:26.186 --> 02:46:28.288
just as it had
with the atomic bomb.

3568
02:46:28.322 --> 02:46:31.726
"Just as it had with
the atomic bomb," exactly!

3569
02:46:31.759 --> 02:46:36.497
No moral scruples in 1945,
plenty in 1949.

3570
02:46:40.635 --> 02:46:42.469
GRAY:
Dr. Oppenheimer...

3571
02:46:44.137 --> 02:46:46.741
...when did your strong
moral convictions develop

3572
02:46:46.774 --> 02:46:49.577
with respect
to the hydrogen bomb?

3573
02:46:56.618 --> 02:46:59.521
When it became clear to me

3574
02:46:59.554 --> 02:47:03.190
that we would tend to use
any weapon we had.

3575
02:47:05.627 --> 02:47:08.128
STRAUSS: <i>J. Robert Oppenheimer,</i>
<i>the martyr.</i>

3576
02:47:08.161 --> 02:47:10.765
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

3577
02:47:10.798 --> 02:47:13.066
To be remembered for Trinity,

3578
02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:15.703
not Hiroshima,

3579
02:47:15.737 --> 02:47:18.171
not Nagasaki.

3580
02:47:20.708 --> 02:47:23.410
He should be thanking me.

3581
02:47:23.443 --> 02:47:26.380
Well, he's not.

3582
02:47:26.413 --> 02:47:28.181
(huffs)

3583
02:47:28.215 --> 02:47:29.817
Do we still have enough votes,

3584
02:47:29.851 --> 02:47:31.519
or is the crowning moment
of my career

3585
02:47:31.553 --> 02:47:35.690
about to become the most public
humiliation of my life?

3586
02:47:35.723 --> 02:47:38.292
Full Senate's about to vote.

3587
02:47:38.325 --> 02:47:39.493
You'll scrape through.

3588
02:47:39.527 --> 02:47:41.161
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

3590

This board, having heard
testimony from you

3591
02:47:46.199 --> 02:47:49.336
and many of your current

3592

that you are a loyal citizen.

3594
02:47:55.810 --> 02:47:57.444

of this country,

3598
02:48:04.619 --> 02:48:08.155
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

3599
02:48:08.188 --> 02:48:10.725
on the hydrogen bomb program

3600
02:48:10.758 --> 02:48:12.292
and the regrettable
lack of candor

3601
02:48:12.326 --> 02:48:14.696
in certain of your responses
to this board,

3602
02:48:14.729 --> 02:48:17.599
we have voted two to one

3603
02:48:17.632 --> 02:48:20.735

led by the junior senator

Young guy trying

3631
02:49:37.712 --> 02:49:40.280
didn't like what you did

Here's a fact.

3645
02:50:31.498 --> 02:50:33.333
President Eisenhower pinned
the Medal of Freedom

3646
02:50:33.366 --> 02:50:34.802
on my chest last year

3647
02:50:34.836 --> 02:50:37.337
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3648
02:50:37.370 --> 02:50:39.874
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

3649
02:50:39.907 --> 02:50:42.342
Well, that's... that's fine.

3650
02:50:42.375 --> 02:50:44.712
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

3651
02:50:44.746 --> 02:50:45.780
Maybe they will.

3652
02:50:46.781 --> 02:50:48.015
I told you,

3653
02:50:48.049 --> 02:50:50.685
he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

3654
02:50:50.718 --> 02:50:52.887
starting with Einstein.
I told you about, uh, Einstein.

3655
02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:54.354
I saw him by the pond.

3656
02:50:54.387 --> 02:50:55.890
You did, but you know, sir,

3657
02:50:55.923 --> 02:50:57.925
since nobody really knows

3658
02:50:57.959 --> 02:50:59.594
what they said
to each other that day,

3659
02:50:59.627 --> 02:51:03.664
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

3660
02:51:03.698 --> 02:51:06.834
Is it possible they spoke
about something, uh,

3661
02:51:06.868 --> 02:51:08.301
more important?

3662
02:51:08.335 --> 02:51:09.771
REPORTERS:
Mr. Strauss!

3663
02:51:09.804 --> 02:51:11.505
(clamoring)

3664
02:51:13.107 --> 02:51:15.509
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3665
02:51:18.646 --> 02:51:21.916
Oh. (chuckling)

3666
02:51:21.949 --> 02:51:23.050
(gentle music playing)

3667
02:51:23.084 --> 02:51:24.384
Thank you.

3668
02:51:24.417 --> 02:51:26.921
-(laughing)
-Albert.

3669
02:51:26.954 --> 02:51:28.923
-Ah.
-(clears throat)

3670
02:51:28.956 --> 02:51:31.458
The man of the moment.

3671
02:51:34.562 --> 02:51:37.932
You once held
a-a reception for me.

3672
02:51:37.965 --> 02:51:39.767
In Berkeley.
You gave me an award.

3673
02:51:39.801 --> 02:51:41.669
-Hmm?
-Yes.

3674
02:51:42.570 --> 02:51:44.972
You all thought that
I had lost the ability

3675
02:51:45.006 --> 02:51:47.942
to understand what I'd started.

3676
02:51:47.975 --> 02:51:51.411
So the award
really wasn't for me,

3677
02:51:51.444 --> 02:51:53.848
it was for all of you, hmm?

3678
02:51:55.716 --> 02:51:57.718
Now it's your turn

3679
02:51:57.752 --> 02:52:02.455
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

3680
02:52:03.390 --> 02:52:04.692
And one day,

3681
02:52:04.725 --> 02:52:07.360
when they've
punished you enough...

3682
02:52:08.763 --> 02:52:12.667
...they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

3683
02:52:16.403 --> 02:52:18.438
Make speeches...

3684
02:52:19.472 --> 02:52:20.975
<i>...give you a medal.</i>

3685
02:52:21.008 --> 02:52:22.643
(applause)

3686
02:52:22.677 --> 02:52:24.846
Hello, Frank.

3687
02:52:24.879 --> 02:52:26.113
You're happy, I'm happy.

3688
02:52:26.147 --> 02:52:28.649
(gentle music continues)

3689
02:52:33.087 --> 02:52:36.423
EINSTEIN: <i>Pat you on the back,</i>
<i>tell you all is forgiven.</i>

3690
02:52:37.959 --> 02:52:40.360
<i>Just remember...</i>

3691
02:52:40.995 --> 02:52:42.864
<i>...it won't be for you.</i>

3692
02:52:47.134 --> 02:52:48.769
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

3693
02:52:51.504 --> 02:52:53.741
(suspenseful music playing)

3694
02:53:02.917 --> 02:53:04.451
Albert.

3695
02:53:05.686 --> 02:53:09.156
When I came to you
with those calculations,

3696
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:11.424
we thought we might
start a chain reaction

3697
02:53:11.458 --> 02:53:14.929
that would destroy
the entire world.

3698
02:53:14.962 --> 02:53:18.431
Mm, I remember it well.

3699
02:53:18.465 --> 02:53:20.534
What of it?

3700
02:53:23.170 --> 02:53:24.906
I believe we did.

3701
02:53:24.939 --> 02:53:27.208
(suspenseful music continues)

3702
02:53:27.241 --> 02:53:29.677
(rhythmic stomping)

3703
02:53:43.557 --> 02:53:45.458
(music tempo quickening)

3704
02:53:45.492 --> 02:53:47.628
(engine rumbling)

3705
02:53:54.669 --> 02:53:56.704
(up-tempo music continues)

3706
02:54:08.282 --> 02:54:10.685
(music fades out)

3707
02:54:13.287 --> 02:54:15.990
